mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
statutory
construction
case
revisiting
the
preemption
provisions
of
the
erisa
statute.
the
issue
is
whether
they
preempt
the
application
of
state
antisubrogation
automobile
insurance
laws
as
applied
directly
to
self-funded
employee
welfare
plans.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
decided
three
cases
involving
this
exact
question.
two
have
found
preemption
as
to
self-funded
plans,
whereas
one,
the
third
circuit
below,
found
no
preemption.
in
all
the
courts
of
appeals
have
address
nine
cases
involving
essentially
this
question
of
which
seven
have
found
preemption
and
two,
including
the
court
below,
found
no
preemption.
now
the
section
514,
the
preemption
provision
of
the
erisa,
contains
a
tripartite
preemption
provision.
first,
there
is
the
broad
preemption
clause
that
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
construe
on
a
number
of
occasions.
secondly,
there
is
an
insurance
savings
clause,
so
called,
which
exempts
from
the
general
preemption
provision,
the
traditional
state
area
of
insurance
regulation.
thirdly,
there
is
the
so-called
deemer
clause,
which
indicates...
which
is
at
issue
here
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
had
the
third
provision,
the
deemer
clause,
directly
before
it,
although
you
had
occasion
to
analyze
it
rather
thoroughly
in
considering
the
savings
clause
in
the
case
of
metropolitan
life
insurance
company.
now
the
broad
preemption
clause
has
been
held
to
be
deliberately
expansive,
designed
to
establish
a
pension
plan
regulation
as
exclusively
a
federal
concern.
preempted
are
state
laws
which
relate
to
an
erisa
plan...
that's
the
statutory
term...
in
that
they
affect
the
administration
of
a
plan
or
directly
impact
the
provisions
of
a
plan.
now
the
courts
of
appeal
have
uniformly
held
that
state
insurance
laws
prohibiting
the
subrogation
of
automobile
injury
claims
relate
to
erisa
insofar
as
they
are
attempted
to
be
applied
to
erisa
plans
and
they
are
thus
preempted
unless
saved
by
the
insurance
savings
clause.
the
plan
here...
the
law
here
in
pennsylvania
relates
to
this
plan,
because
it
reaches
right
into
the
plan
as
promulgated
and
removes
a
provision
calling
for
the
plan
to
have
the
right
of
subrogation
when
the
planned
beneficiary
recovers
against
a
third
party
tort
feasor.
now
the
insurance
savings
clause
saves
from
preemption
state
laws
regulating
insurance
and
in
this
instance
may
protect--
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
--pardon
me?
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
no,
the
insurance
clause.
i'm
going
through
first
the
broad
preemption
clause,
then
the
insurance
clause
which
may
protect
an
anti-subrogation
from
preemption
unless
the
deemer
clause
imposes
its
limiting
power
upon
the
insurance
savings
clause.
now
the
deemer
clause
is
a
limitation
in
turn
upon
the
insurance
savings
clause.
in
fact,
in
the
metropolitan
life
case
this
court
said
that
the
deemer
clause
modifies
the
insurance
savings
clause
and
so
it
would
appear
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
well,
it
goes
on.
it's
more
than
just
purporting
to
regulate.
it
says
purporting
to
regulate
insurance
companies,
insurance
contracts,
banks,
trust
companies,
et
cetera.
that's...
i
don't
know
that
the
phrase
needs
particular
definition.
although,
you
know,
the
word
purporting
to
is
what
the
third
circuit
seized
upon
and
suggested
that
the
inclusion
of
the
word
purporting
in
that
statute
amounted
to
the
word
pretextually.
or
the
state
had,
through
some
back
door
or
pretextual
method,
endeavored
to
regulate
these
plans.
i
don't
believe
we
need
to
go
that
far.
indeed,
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
court
by
my
friends
here
do
not
attempt
to
defend
that
interpretation
as
it
was
rendered
in
the
third
circuit,
which
i
must
say
was
also
the
interpretation
that
the
sixth
circuit
took
in
the
northern
group
case.
they
both
seemed
to
think
that
that
would
purport
somehow
implied
a
pretextual
approach
which
we
don't
think
is
justified
by
the...
by
the
language.
the
deemer
clause
does
not
necessarily
have
to
attack
a
pretextual
expansion
of
state
regulation
but
one
which
goes
beyond
the
regular
historical
exception
of
the
insurance
industry
as
we
have
known
it
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
elsewhere.
now,
in
metropolitan
life
this
court
saved
a
mandated
benefits
law
as
applied
to
an
insured
plan,
but
noted
that
the
same
law
would
be
preempted
as
to
a
self-funded
plan,
and
pointed
out
that
while
the
court
recognized
that
that
placed
some
difference
between
self-funded
plans
and
insured
plans,
that
that
was
a
difference
that
was
inherent
in
the
program
established
by
congress.
and
in
order
to
reach
that
analysis,
the
court
analyzed
the
whole
of
section
314,
the
whole
preemption
section,
so
that
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
followed
the
analysis
set
forth
in
the
metropolitan
life
case.
and
i
think
that
would
be
careful
approach
for
the
courts
of
appeals
because
after
all,
while
it
was
not
the
holding
of
metropolitan
life,
it
was
nonetheless
an
integral
of
that
court...
of
your
court's
analysis
only
5
years
ago,
a
unanimous
court.
the
third
circuit,
in
addition
to
injecting
a
pretextual
concept,
also
injected
some...
another
new
concept
that
isn't
founded
in
the
statute.
and
that
was
what
was
called
the
core
erisa
concept
that
they
used
to
say
that
subrogation
laws
were
not
within
the
core
erisa
concerns
and
therefore
the
anti-subrogation
laws
would
not
be
dealt
with
by
the
deemer
provision.
on
the
other
hand,
the
sixth
circuit,
in
straying
from
the
implications
and
analysis
of
metropolitan
life,
injected
a
theory
of
balancing
state
versus
federal
interests.
and
that
is,
again,
not
grounded
at
all
in
the
statute.
the
court
indicated
that
in
looking
at
a
particular
state
regulation,
that
there
should
be
a
balancing
as
to
the
relative
significance
that
the
state
had
in
the
matter
had
versus
the
federal
government.
and
here
again
that
seemed
to
have
no
basis
in
the
act.
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
chief
justice,
that's
exactly
our
view.
and
the
happy...
the
happy
import
of
that
view
is
that
it
is
a
relatively
convenient
rule
of
decision.
it...
as
opposed
to
a
core
erisa
concept
or
something
else,
it's
not
vague
and
imprecise
or
hard
to
define.
there
might
be
borderline
case
that
arise
but
it
seems
to
be
a
more
helpful
rule
to
guide
the
planned
administrators
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
i
believe
that
is
right,
justice--
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
--congress...
and
it
took
me
a
long
while
to
come
to
this
view,
indeed,
after
the
briefs
were
written.
and
i
reread
three
articles
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs
which
somehow
brought
the
matter
into
focus
to
me.
and
those
are
the
1967
law
review
article
by
mr.
goetz,
the
1976
article
by
brummond,
and
the
1973
note
in
the
georgetown
law
review.
those
are
all
cited.
and
what
those
three
articles
did
was
describe,
each
of
them
in
their
own
different
perspective,
the
historical
conditions
that
were
existing
at
the
time
congress
enacted
erisa
in
'74.
and
it
was
this
in
the
late
1960's
and
early
'70's,
these
self-funded
or
uninsured
plans
were
growing
in
both
number
and
size.
the
state
insurance
commissioners
were
viewing
these
phenomena.
they
didn't
appear
to
be
within
the
definitional
jurisdiction
of
the
state
insurance
commissioners.
they...
but
the
commissioners
nonetheless
viewed
them
as
something
rather
like
insurance.
so,
they
were
trying
to
decide
how
to
expand
their
regulatory
turf
as
it
were.
two
proposals
were
made.
one,
model
legislation
was
proposed
by
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
in
1964.
however,
that
model
legislation
was
never
adopted
in
any
state.
so,
failing
the
legislative
route,
the
state
sought
judicial
determinations
that
self-funded
plans
were
the
equivalent
of
insurance
and
were
therefore
within
the
purview
of
the
existing
state
regulations.
there
was
a
monsanto
case
in
the
missouri
state
court
system
that
illustrates
this.
now,
in
1974
when
this
pulling
and
tugging
was
going
on,
the
congress
enacts
erisa
and
it
would
appear
very
logical
if
congress
had
been
aware
of
the
efforts
of
the
state
insurance
commissioners
to
expand
their
regulatory
power
to
incorporate
the
health
care...
the
self-funded
benefit
plans.
and
i
would
suggest
that
based
on
this...
i
grant
you,
your
honor,
extrinsic
evidence
or
historical
context
that
the
deemer
clause
was
intended
to
resolve
this
question.
and
it
was
intended
to
resolve
it
in
favor
of
the
application
of
federal
law
and
erisa
rather
than
encouraging
the
expansion
of
the
state
insurance
commissions'
power
in
this
manner.
congress
was
willing
to
brook
the
extent
of
state
insurance
regulation
as
it
stood,
but
they
in
a
timely
manner
decided
to
resolve
this
question
of
what
law
should
regulate
these
new--
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
--they--
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
missed
the
point
of
the
articles.
they
cite
these
articles
and
go
through
it.
but
i
think
one
can
come
to
a
differing
interpretation,
perhaps
depending
on
which
line
you're
trying
to
establish.
but
it
seems
to
me
when
your
honor
says
what
was
the
sense
of
this,
is
it
an
aberrational
distinction
or
is
it
one
that
makes
sense.
if
it's
been
analyzed
that
way
it
seems
congress
made
a
decision
and
that
they...
and
this
decision
furthermore
is
consistent
with
the
broad
preemptive
sweep
of
514(a),
the...
which
says
this
shall
be
basically
a...
these
funds
and
pensions
will
be
nationally
regulated
so
there's
a
uniform
system.
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
well--
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
--yes,
i
don't
know
that
the
word
person
is
where
to
focus
though
on
1144(b)2(a),
where
it
says,
nothing
in
this
subchapter
shall
be
construed
to
exempt
or
relieve
any
person
from
any
law
of
any
state
which
regulates
insurance.
i
think,
your
honor,
they
focus
more
on
the
insurance
word
there
and
they
say
that
somehow
when
you
get
down
into
(b),
into
the
so-called
deemer
clause,
that
the
words
are
not
exactly
congruent.
but
if
you
read
the
third
clause,
it
seems
very
possible
to
read
it
as
broader
than
the
insurance
savings
clause,
as
if
congress
said,
we're
going
to
make
this
lid
larger
than
the
pot
to
make
sure
that
nothing
escapes
from
the
insurance
savings
clause
that
shouldn't
go
out
of
it.
but
i
don't
think
the
lack
of
congruity
in
language
means
anything
of
significance.
the--
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
--no,
but
you
are
an
employee
benefit
plan,
which
is
the
type
of
entity
that
my
client
is
and
which
is
what
is
specifically...
so
that
if
it's
a
person
under
(a)...
it
seems
to
me
that
type
of
person
is
what
is
carved
out.
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
the...
as
best
i
could
tell,
your
honor,
that
a
person
would
be
incorporating
any
type
of
entity
here,
and
i
don't...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
just
not
much
help
perhaps.
i
don't...
i
can't
take
your
point
further.
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
if
the
court
please,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of--
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
--in
this
particular
case,
you
don't,
of
course,
need
to
reach
that.
it
would
in
all
probability
be
that
sort
of
mandated
benefit
law
that
would
not
survive
as
applied
to
self-funded
plans
and
that
if
there
is
to
be
mandated
benefits
or
freedom
of
choice
of
providers
and
so
on,
that
it
would
be
up
to
congress
to
supply
that
under
the
national
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
i'm
thinking
that
there
may
be
as
applied
to
a
self-funded
plan
only.
you
see
it
would...
the
freedom
of
choice
laws
as
so-called
in
the
states
would
be
saved
by
the
insurance
savings
clause,
but
they
may,
as
applied
to
self-funded
plans,
be
preempted.
so
that,
as
i
say,
if
there
is
to
be...
if
that
arises
and
people
are
disturbed
about
it,
they
should...
the
answer
is
to
have
congress
mandate
benefits
which
in
the
health
and
welfare
area,
congress
chose
not
to
do
in
the
1974
original
erisa
enactment.
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
we
don't
think
it
adds
anything.
mr.
h.
woodruff
turner
no,
we
don't
think
it...
in
fact
the
word
purporting
is
also
found
in
the
statute
in
the
definition
of
a
state,
and
the
use
of
the
word
purporting
there
i
think
is
very
similar
to
the
use
here.
that
is,
the
definition
of
the
word
state
would
add
the
meaning
of
the
preemption
provision
also
contains
the
word
purporting
in
the
same
context
that
we
claim
it
is
here.
with
respect
to
the
word
"person"
that
you
focus
on
in
the
savings
clause,
we
believe
that
the
question
is
whether
the
deemer
clause
effectively
takes
this
out
of
the
savings
clause
because
this
state
law,
the
state
law
that
is
at
issue
here,
is
a
law
which
we
submit
does
regulate
insurance
contracts
and,
in
doing
so,
deems
a
plan
to
be
an
insurer.
indeed,
if
the
plan
were
not
an
insurer
for
purposes
of
this
law
regulating
insurance
contracts,
the
case
would
not
fall
within
the
savings
clause
at
all.
in
other
words,
we
believe
the
very
factors
that
bring
it
within
the
savings
clause
also
bring
it
within
the
deemer
clause
because
the
plan
is
effectively
deemed
by
the
state
law
to
be
an
insurer
for
the
purposes
of
a
law
regulating
insurance
contracts,
telling
insurers
that
they
are
not
allowed
to
put
a
subrogation
provision
in
their
contract.
if
they
do,
they
will
be
void.
the
effect
of
the
respondent's
argument
we
submit
is
to
give
the
states
very
broad
authority
to
regulate
plans
directly
outside
the
very
limited
area
of...
of
capitalization
requirements
and
licensing.
it
would
allow
them
to
regulate
such
matters
as
fiduciary
responsibilities.
it
would
allow
them
to
regulate
disclosure.
the
very
core
concern
that
the
court
below
conceded
was
foreclosed
to
the
states.
moreover,
it
would
allow
the
states
free
reign
to
prohibit
provisions
and
plans,
require
provisions
and
plans,
eliminate
efforts
of
the
plans
to
achieve
uniform
administration.
in
our
view
the
most
remarkable
statement
in
the
brief
of
the
ncsl
is
that
the
deemer
clause
is
simply
not
directed
at
the
relationship
between
the
insured
and
his
insurer.
now
the
respondents
and
their
amici
suggest
that
the
effect
of
our
argument
is
to
leave
a
regulatory
vacuum.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
a
regulatory
vacuum.
it
is
a
recognition
in
the
preemption
provisions
of
federal
responsibility,
responsibility
of
the
courts
to
develop
a
federal
common
law
to
deal
with
these
issues,
a
responsibility
on
congress
to
engage
in
continuing
oversight.
both
branches
have
been
meeting
that
responsibility.
congress
has
several
times
amended
the
deemer
clause,
the
preemption
provisions
to
allow
a
wise
health
care
act,
to
deal
with
special
problems
of
multi-employer
plans.
congress
and
the
courts
have
been
recognizing
the
responsibility
that
the
preemption
provisions
impose
on
them.
and
so
for
those
reasons
and
because
the
respondent's
argument
would
undue
the
clear
purpose
of
the
preemption
clause,
we
join
the
petitioner
in
urging--
