justice
scalia
purporting
to--
justice
scalia
--regulating...
are
you
talking
about
the
deemer
clause
now
or
the
insurance?
justice
scalia
why
is
that
broader...
why
is
that
broader?
one
says
regulates
insurance.
now,
what
does
insurance
consist
of
unless
it
consists
of
either
insurance...
regulating
insurance
companies
or
regulating
insurance
contracts.
i
can't
imagine
what
else.
what
is--
justice
scalia
--well,
they
may
have
used
different
language,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
possibly
get
any
broader
than...
i
don't
know...
what
is...
what
is
contained
within
the
meaning
of
insurance
that
does
not
consist
of
either
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts?
justice
scalia
it
would
still...
even
as
it
affects
the
common
law
remedy,
it
would
still
purport
to
regulate
insurance
companies.
justice
scalia
i
guess
that
interpretation
is--
justice
scalia
--interpretation
is
the
perhaps
assisted
by
that
phrase
in
there,
in
the
deemer
clause
"or
to
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance
or
banking.
"
for
purposes
of
any
law
or
to
be
engaged...
they
shall
not
only
not
be
deemed
to
be
an
insurance
company,
but
they
shall
not
be
engaged
in
the
business...
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance
or
banking.
what
seems
to
be
envisioned
is
a
law
that
is
directed
against
either
an
insurance
company
or...
that
is
expressly
directed
against
an
insurance
company
or
someone
who
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance.
justice
scalia
the
problem
i
have
with
that,
mr.
rothfeld,
is
that
i
don't
see
how
it
makes
any
sense.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
why
the
position
urged
by
your
opponents
make
some
sense.
this
i
don't
understand.
justice
scalia
all
right.
tell
me.
justice
scalia
how
would
this
statute
have
to
read
to
come
within
the
deemer
clause?
it...
it...
it
would
have
to
be
narrower
so
it
would
simply
have
to
say
that
there
shall
be
no
subrogation
of
insurers
in
insurance
contracts?
justice
scalia
then...
then
it
would
be
covered
by
the
deemer
clause.
justice
scalia
what...
what
about
a
more
general
statute
that
doesn't
just
speak
of
whether
such
a
provision
in
the
contract
would
be
valid
but
it
just
says
insurance
companies
shall
have
no
right
of
subrogation,
neither
by
contract
nor
at
common
law?
justice
scalia
that
would
not
fall--
--not
regulate
insurance
contracts?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
just
says
purporting
to
regulate.
justice
scalia
it
purports
to
regulate
insurance
contracts.
now,
it
purports
to
regulate
things
beyond
insurance
contracts
as
well.
justice
scalia
no,
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
your...
your
point
here.
justice
scalia
now,
let
me
cut
in
there
now.
all
right.
what
about
as
an
explanation
for
why
congress
wrote
it
this
way,
simply
however
irrational
it
might
be,
the
sacrosanct
nature
of
state
insurance
regulation?
congress
might
well
have
thought,
look
it,
the
states
have
always
dealt
with
regulating
insurance
companies.
if
they
are
somehow
affecting
erisa
plans
through
their
regulation
of
an
insurance
company
that
sells
insurance
to
those
plans,
we're
not
going
to
mess
with
that
because
basically
federal
government
has
always
left
it
to
the
states
to
regulate
insurance
companies.
justice
scalia
you
know,
you
might
think
that
as
a
policy
matter
that's
not
a
good
idea
and
maybe
it's
irrational,
but
it
could
have
happened,
couldn't
it?
