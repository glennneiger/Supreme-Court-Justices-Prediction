89-1048,
the

corporation
v.
cynthia
holliday.
mr.
turner.
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
position,
mr.
turner,
then
is
that
all
of
the
preemption
doctrine
could
be
pretty
well
spelled
out
of
the
try...
of
the
language
of
the
tripartite
preemption
provision,
the
broad
preemption
clause,
the
exception
for
the
business
of
insurance
and
then
the
deemer
provision
that
says
an
employee
benefit
plan
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
the
business
of
insurance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
turner.
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
shapiro,
could
i
ask
that
you
take
a
stab
at
explaining
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
treat
self-insured
plans
differently?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
rothfeld,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief

rehnquist
or
of
any
law
of
any
state
purporting
to
regulate
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
certainly
regulates
the
right
of
an
insurer
to...
to
be
subrogated.
chief
justice
rehnquist
subrogation
is
not
something
that
you
find
across
the
board
in
the
law.
it's
typically
an
insurance
remedy
when
they
pay
off
someone
they've
insured
to
go
after
the
tort
feasor.
so;
i
mean
it
isn't
as
it
this
were
a
generally
applicable
statute
that
applied
to
all
sorts
of
situations.
subrogation
is
typically
an
insurance
technique.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's...
that's
by
no
means
as
self-evident,
or
that's
not
the
only
possible
meaning
of
the
word
"to
regulate
insurance".
that's
a
fairly
narrow
reading,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
with
respect
to
employee
benefit
plans.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
rothfeld,
do
you
agree
with
the
reasoning
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
which
this
certainly
supports
the
results
you
want,
about
the
erisa
core
concerns?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
it
would
have
to
regulate
only
insurance
contracts
and
not
any
other
kind
of
contracts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.

against
holliday
will
be
announced
