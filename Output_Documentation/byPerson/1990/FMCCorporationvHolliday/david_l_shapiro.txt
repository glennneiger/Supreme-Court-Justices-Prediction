mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
congress
did
not
give
us...
i
should
have
said
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice...
congress
did
not
elaborate
in
great
detail
on
why
in
the
first
place
it
excepted
insurance
regulation
from
the
scope
of
preemption,
and
that
brought
the
plan
itself
under...
plans
themselves
outside
the
scope
of
the
savings
clauses,
as
we
argue.
but
i
believe
that
the
explanation
lies
in
the
combination
of
two
factors.
one
is
the
long
standing
recognition
of
state
interests
in
the
areas
of
traditional
insurance
regulation,
a
recognition
that's
embodied
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
which
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
savings
clause.
i
think
it
was
then
realized,
particularly
as
the
preemption
clause
was
broadened
out
at
conference,
although
the
deemer
predates
that,
i
think
it
was
realized
that
if
the
plans
themselves
would
be
subject
to
regulation
under
this
recognition
of
traditional
state
power,
that
the
purpose
of
preemption,
both
the
original
narrow
purpose
of
preemption
and
the
broader
purpose
of
preemption
as
it
emerged
from
conference
would
be
severely...
severely
thwarted.
so,
i
think
the
reason
for
this
distinction
is
that
effort
which
is
bewildering
admittedly
at
times
had
effort
to
preserve
state
power
to
regulate
insurance
companies
and
insurance
in
traditional
ways
but
not
to
regulate
plans
directly
through
that
device.
and
that's
why
i
think
the
deemer
clause
is
such
an
essential
complement
to
the
saving
clause.
the
time
that
i
have
available
i
would
like
to
focus
on
an
argument
that...
that
is
made
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
by
the
respondent
and
by
her
amicus,
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures,
in
an
approach
that
is
very
different
from
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals.
they
argue
that
while
the
savings
clause
is
a
broad
reservation
of
state
authority
to
regulate
insurance,
the
deemer
clause
is,
in
its
turn,
only
a
very
narrow
exemption
to
the
savings
clause.
they
say
that
the
deemer
clause
relates
only
to
those
laws
that
regulate
insurance
as
a
business,
a
phrase
that
they
do
not
exactly
define
but
which
appears
to
govern
such
state
laws
as
those
affecting
licensing
or
capital
structure
requirements
or
perhaps
premium
levels.
the
deemer
clause
in
their
view
leaves
very
broad
authority
to
regulate
benefit
plans
directly
as
a
result
of
the
savings
clause.
we
submit
that
argument
fails
on
every
ground.
it
fails
because
it's
contradicted
by
the
broad
text
of
the
deemer
clause,
and
we
believe
it
fails
because
it
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
preemption
provisions
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
such
cases
as
fort
halifax
and
others.
looking
first
at
the
text
of
the
deemer
clause,
the
respondents
emphasize
the
phrase
that
no
plan
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
insurance
company
or
to
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance.
they
go
on
the
fact
that
the
deemer
clause
is
much
broader.
it
says
no
plan
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
insurance
company
or
other
insurer
or
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance,
and
then
there
follows
a
clause
that
they
studiously
ignore
for
purposes
of
any
law
of
any
state
regulating
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts.
we
submit
that
section
1719
of
the
pennsylvania
law
is
plainly
a
law
of
the
state
regulating
insurance
contracts.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
there
are
two
aspects
to
your
question,
your
honor.
i
think
first
the
word
purporting
as
such
does
not
mean
that
the
state
has
to
expressly
deem
someone
to
be
an
insurance
company.
purporting
could
be
expressly
or
by
implication.
the
dictionary
is
clear
on
that.
we
don't
think
purporting
requires
either
a
pretext,
as
the
court
below
suggests,
or
a
specific
announced
purpose.
we
think
the
fact
that
this
state
law
deals
with
insurance
subrogation
provisions
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
word
purporting.
now,
the
second
part
of
your
question
focuses--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--no,
it
stops...
this
court--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--that's
part
of
it,
your
honor.
it's
a
broad
responsibility
of
all
the
federal
courts
that
they
haven't
engaged
in.
but
it's
also
responsibility
of
a
continuing
oversight
by
congress
and
specific
amendments
to
the
preemption
provisions
that
recognize
that
responsibility
as
well
as
the
broad
scope
of
the
preemption
clause.
thank
you.
