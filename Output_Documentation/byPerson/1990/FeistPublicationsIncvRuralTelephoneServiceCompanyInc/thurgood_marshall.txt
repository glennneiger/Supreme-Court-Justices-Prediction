the

what
individual.
i
never
heard
of
a

an

it?
justice
marshall
the
phone
company
couldn't
exist
without
this,
could
they?

if
you
didn't
get

justice

i
just
don't
see
all
of
the
originality
of
somebody
in
this
that
just
copied
something
out
of
a
book...
somebody's
records.
justice
marshall
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
charge
you
to
take
you
name
out.

not
speaking
about
everybody.

to
speak
about
it?
[laughter]
