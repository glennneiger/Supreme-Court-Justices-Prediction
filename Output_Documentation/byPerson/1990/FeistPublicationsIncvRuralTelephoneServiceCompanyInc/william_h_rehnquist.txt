h.
rehnquist
knobbe,
excuse
me.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
knobbe,
do
you
think
the
1976
act
changed
the
copyrightability
of
a
directory
such
as
is
involved
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
kind
of
directory
we
have
here
would
have
been
copyrighted...
copyrightable
under
the
law
as
it
existed
before
1976?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
then
you
say
that
you
must
depend
then
on
the
changes
wrought
in
the
law
in
the
1976--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
you
said
a
moment
ago
you
thought
it
would
be
copyrightable
under
the
preexisting
law
but
it's
not
copyrightable
under
this
law.
then
you
must
depend
on
the
changes
effected
in
the
1976
act,
must
you
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
then
do
you
say
that
the
rural
directory
here
was
copyrightable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
the
rural
directory--
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
knobbe.
mr.
caplinger,

now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist

the
question,
mr.
caplinger.
