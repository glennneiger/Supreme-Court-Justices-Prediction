mr.
kyler
knobbe
knobbe,
your
honor.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
copyrightability
of
a
phone
subscriber's
name,
address,
and
telephone
number
as
published
by
the
phone
company
in
its
directory.
the
effect
of
the
decisions
below,
which
came
from
the
district
of
kansas
in
the
tenth
circuit,
is
to
hold
that
a
private
company
cannot
publish
these
facts
in
its
own
directory
without
first
doing
a
canvas
to
obtain
the
facts
from
the
phone
subscriber.
our
position
is
that
while
the
telephone
company's
directory
may
be
copyrightable
as
a
whole,
the
phone
company's
alphabetical
list
of
names,
address,
and
telephone
numbers
of
its
subscribers
is
not
a
work
of
authorship
under
the
statute,
section
101
of
the
copyright
act.
and
that
even
if
the
alphabetical
list
of
subscribers
was
somehow
copyrightable
as
a
whole,
that
copyright
doesn't
extend
any
protection
to
the
preexisting
facts
in
the
list...
the
name,
address,
and
telephone
number.
to
briefly
explain
the
facts,
the
easiest
way
to
understand
them
is,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
about
five
pages
from
the
back,
on
page
93,
there's
a
colored
map.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
page
93
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
that's
a
map
of
the
northwest
corner
of
the
state
of
kansas.
there
are
15
counties,
16,000
square
miles
in
northwest
kansas.
what
each
of
the
colors
on
the
map
represent
is
a
different
telephone
directory.
where
feist
started
out...
the
petitioner
in
this
case...
feist
started
out
in
southwest
kansas
which
is
just
to
the
south
of
here.
basically
the
scenario
was
the
same.
there
was
a
patchwork.
each
of
these
colors
was
a
different
phone
directory.
and
if
you
were
in
spearville,
kansas--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--our...
feist
publications
publishes
an
area-wide
directory
for
all
of
those
colors.
what
we
do
is
put
all
of
the
colors
together.
the
problem
was
when
feist
started
out.
this
is
rural...
i
mean,
rural
not
in
the
sense
of
rural
telephone...
but
rural
in
the
sense
of
non-urban.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yellow.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
the
yellow
is
rural
telephone
service
area.
okay.
if
you
were
in
spearville,
kansas,
where
feist
started
out
and
you
wanted
to
call
your
county
seat,
dodd
city,
kansas,
to
check
on
your
property
taxes,
you
couldn't
find
the
number
in
your
directory
because
your
directory
only
had
the
listings
for
your
exchanges
that
were
serviced
by
your
phone
company.
dodd
city
was
serviced
by
a
different
company.
so
you
had
to
dial
the
information
operator.
what
feist's
idea
was
to
put...
was
to
put
all
of
these
colors
together
into
one
area-wide
directory,
so
if
you
were
a
phone
subscriber,
you
could
have
access
to
all
those
listings
for
that
area.
if
you
wanted
to
call
your
county
seat,
if
you
wanted
to
call
an
implement
dealer
two
towns
over--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--thank
you,
your
honor.
[laughter]
to
do
that...
what
feist
did
was
went
to
the
various
phone
companies
here
and
licensed
their
updated
white
page
listings
so
he
could
print
those
in
the
directory.
now,
one
thing
that's
important
to
note
is
he
didn't
necessarily
just
license
the
directory.
he
licensed
updated,
white
page
listings,
the
information
that's
available
to
the
directory
operator.
the
reason
for
that
is,
for
example,
if
you
look
on
the
map,
the
directory
that
covers
the
green
area
in
the
lower
left-hand
corner,
that
directory
may
have
came
in
february.
the
directory
that
covers
the
red
area
up
in
the
top
may
have
came
out
in
november.
now
a
feist
directory
that
covers
the
whole
area
comes
out
in
december,
then
the
listings
from
the
red
area
that
came
out
in
november,
those
will
be
fairly
current.
but
the
listings
from
this
green
area
down
here,
if
your
looking
solely
at
the
directory,
are
almost
a
year
out
of
date.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
it's
in
one
giant
alphabetical
list,
your
honor.
the
two
directories
are
part--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--not
broken
down
by
town.
if
you
wanted
to
call
joe
blow
and
you
knew
he
lived
in
jennings,
kansas--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--in
feist's
directory
you
still
looked
under
the
b's
till
you
got
to
blow.
now,
if
you
wanted
to
call
joe
blow
and
you
were
sure
of
where
he
lived.
he
may
have
lived
in
jennings
or
decatur...
you
weren't
sure...
it's
up
in
there
somewhere...
you
could
still
go
alphabetically
to
look
for
blow.
all
of
these
companies
licensed
their
listings
to
feist
except
for
the
yellow
area.
that's
rural
telephone.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes,
feist's
directory
shows
the...
maybe
i
misunderstand
the
question.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
his--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--well,
it
was
his
name,
address,
and
telephone
number,
and
in
this--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--yes,
it
would
show
the
town,
your
honor.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
no,
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--i
wish
it
were
so,
but
that's
incorrect.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
the
phone...
the
phone
company's
directory
does
show
the
name,
address,
and
telephone
number
and
part
of
the
address
is
the
town.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
no.
the...
what
rural's
directory
is...
rural
telephone's
directory
is
also
just
a
straight
alphabetical
list
of
every
subscriber
in
the
yellow
area.
there
are
some
differences--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--yes,
there
are
approximately
3,800...
there
are
4,935
listings
that
are
potentially
duplicates.
and
there
are
3,800
of
them
are
different.
some
of
the
differences
are
in
address
to
the
extent
of
this.
joe
plow,
jennings,
kansas...
excuse
me...
joe
blow,
jennings
is
what
appears
in
the
rural
directory.
now
in
the
feist
directory
it
may
be
joe
blow,
route
2,
box
47,
jennings.
the
town
is
named
in
the--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--directory
throughout.
this
is
not
washington,
d.c.
this--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--that's
the
position
we
take.
it
doesn't
comply
with
the
statute
under
section
101.
we
have
a--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--no,
it
is
not
what
was
done
here.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
that's
correct.
but
that's
our
position
if
you
look
at
the...
if
you
look
at
the
statute.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
no,
they're
all
preexisting
facts.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
it's
simply
an
alphabetical
list
of
their
subscribers.
it
doesn't
comply...
the
statute
is
section
101--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--which
defines
a
compilation.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
this
is
a
compilation
in
the
normal
accepted
term,
but
it's
not
a
compilation
as
defined
in
the
statute.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
it's
not
a
copyrightable
compilation.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
if--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--i
think
so.
if
you're
looking
for
a
handle,
you
know,
maybe
that's
the
handle.
maybe
the
handle
is
xerox
piracy
or
something
of
the
pages.
but
you
can't
protect
the
name,
address,
and
telephone
number
in
a
simple
alphabetical
list.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
the
statutory
language
is
in
section
101
of
the
copyright
act.
that
defines
a
compilation
as
a
work
formed
by
the
collection
and
assembly
of
preexisting
materials
or
data
that
are
selected,
coordinated,
or
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
the
resulting
work
as
a
whole
constitutes
an
original
work
of
authorship.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
it
doesn't...
it
does...
yes,
i
say
that.
it
doesn't
exhibit
any
coordination
or
arrangement.
an
alphabetical
arrangement
can't
be
a
copyrightable
thing.
that's
simply
the
most
efficient
way
to
arrange
something.
wouldn't
we
have
some
severe
problems
with
dictionary
people
and
everyone
else
if
you
could
copyright
the
alphabet?
mr.
kyler
knobbe
well...
same
thing,
but
computer
databases
i
think
are
really...
i
don't
know
if
they're
published
or
not.
i
mean
there's
a
lot
of
stuff
in
the
amicus
here
about,
oh,
we're
going
to
affect
this...
you
know
the
sky
will
fall
and
nothing
will
be
copyrightable.
most
computer
databases
are
handled
by
license
agreements.
they're
protected
by
contract.
i
contract
my
computer
database
to
you
and
as
part
of
that
your
contract
says
you're
not
going
to
further
disseminate
it
or
whatever.
here
we've
got
a
published...
we've
got
a
published
directory.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
that's
their
entire
list
of
subscribership.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
we
don't
think...
publishing
your
entire
list
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
selection
to
us.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
well--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--if
it's
a
selection,
it's
not
a
copyrightable
selection.
that's
our
position.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
a
work
of
authorship,
yes.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
isn't
there
some
type
of...
our
position
is
there's
some
type
of
objective
or
subjective
that
you
select...
maybe
we
can--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--and
i...
we
can't
say
creativity--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--because
if
you
get
into
creativity
what
you
get
into...
that's
what
the
new
act
gets
away
from.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
selection...
if
you
can
select
the
whole...
the
whole
range
of
data,
and
that's
copyrightable,
okay?
actually,
as
one
answer,
we
didn't
take
their
selection.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
we
did
the
whole
area,
not
just
theirs.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
in
our
view,
that
has
made
some
selection,
other
than
just
publish
everything.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
if
i
publish--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--all
are
published
are
facts.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
what
i've
published
then
is
i've
selected
just
to
publish
all
the
facts,
and
all
the
facts
that
i've
published
cannot
be--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--are
not
protected.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
i
will
concede
that's
a
selection.
i
won't
concede
that
that's
a
copyrightable
selection,
because
what
have
i
done
other
than
just
publish
a
list
of
the
facts?
mr.
kyler
knobbe
their
coordination,
arrangement,
selection,
if
they
exhibit
sufficient
coordination,
arrangement,
and
selection,
sure
that's
copyrightable.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes,
your
honor.
our
position
is
if
you
publish
them
all,
that's
not.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
well,
the
public
utility
obviously
made
it
because
you're
required
to--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
correct.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
i
could
probably
use
the
help.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
if
i
publish...
you
know,
here's
a
seating
chart
of
the
supreme
court.
if
i
come
in
here
and
make
this
out
and
i
select
only
to
publish
the
senior-most
five
justices...
i
mean,
if
i
select
to
publish
here's
the
seating
chart,
haven't
i
just
published
everything?
i
published
all
the
facts.
so
i
don't
quite
understand
what
work
of
authorship
i've
done.
it's
appears
to
me
that
the
selection,
coordination,
and
arrangement
has
to
be
like
the
baseball
card
case
where
the
author
selected
the
5,000
premium
cards
out
of
there,
the
x
case
out
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes,
that
it's
a
public
fact?
i
mean...
yes.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
well,
if
the
answer
is
that
a
name,
address,
and
telephone
number
are
not
a
fact,
that
they're
somehow
a
copyrightable
authorship,
that
may
be
correct.
but
a
name,
address,
and
telephone
number--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--a
name,
address,
and
telephone
number
is
a
preexisting
fact
that
under
section
103(b)
that
we've
got
the
right
to
publish
it.
if
you
take
the
opinions
of
this
court--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--well,
the
copyright...
we
think
it's
a
preexisting
fact
and
our
position
would
be
then,
the
name,
address,
and
telephone
number
are
like
the
decisions
of
this
court.
okay,
those
are
public
domain
information.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
no,
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--as
i
understand
it--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
there
are
three
portions
to
the
statute.
collecting
and
assembling,
which
is
the
sweat-of-the-brow
theory
that's
adopted
below,
and
that
is
if
you
put
a
lot
of
stuff
together,
you're
an
author
of
it.
the
second
portion
is
selection,
coordination,
and
arrangement.
and
the
third
is
so
that
the
work
as
a
whole
is
a
work
of
authorship.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes,
an
original
work
of
authorship
under
the
statute,
under
101.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
the
register
interprets
the
statute...
as
i
understand
it,
there's
an
article
by
william
patry,
who's
a
policy
planning
advisor
with
the
copyright
office,
and
in
that...
in
that
article
it
talks
about
what
the
copyright
office
does.
as
i
understand
it...
this
is
not
part
of
the
record...
but
they,
for
example,
rejected
the
copyright
on
an
alphabetical
list
of
contributors
of
$2,500
or
more
to
the
republican
party.
it's--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--telephone
yellow
pages--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--telephone
books
they
copyright
and
there's
an
interesting
footnote
in
that
article
which
i
didn't
realize
is
the
reason
they
copyright
them
is
typically
telephone
books
are
a
combination
of
material.
for
example,
in
here
there
are
yellow-page
advertising
in
the
telephone
company's
book
that
has
art
work
and
layout
in
it
and
that's--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--the
white--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--yes,
these...
the
white
page
only
ones...
that's
footnote
98
of
his
article.
as
i
understand
it
what
they
do
is
the
reason
they
register
them
is
because
of
the
sweat-of-the-brow
theory,
because
of
the
split
in
the
circuits
between
sweat
of
the
brow--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--well,
no
until...
unless
the
supreme
court
tells
them
what
they're
suppose
to
do.
i
assume
that...
you
know,
if
you
came
out
of
a
sweat-of-the-brow
circuit
like
the
seventh
circuit
and
published
a
white
page
only
directory,
the
copyright
office
would
have
to...
i
assume
would
have
to
register
it.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
not,
not
on
that
portion
of
the
directory...
not
on
white
pages
only.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
now,
if
there
are
other--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--the
yellow
pages
have
got
original
art
work.
they've
got
ad
layouts
in
them.
they've
got
works
of...
works
of
authorship,
and
those
are
copyrightable.
there
are
some...
in
this
directory
of
the
phone
company's,
there's
forward
text
in
here.
this
has
how
to...
you
know,
how
to
dial
the
phone
company,
how
to
make
a
long
distance
call,
a
party
line.
i
assume
rural
authored
that
and
that's
copyrightable.
but
that's
really
not
what's
involved.
what's
involved
in
this
case
is
this
little
piece
right
here,
the
alphabetical
list
of
white
pages.
yeah,
it's
a
public
domain
fact.
the
other
statute
is
103(b).
103(b)
says
that
the
copyright
in
a
compilation,
okay,
extends
only
to
the
material
contributed
by
the
author
as
distinguished
from
preexisting
material
employed
in
the
work
and
does
not
imply
any
exclusive
right
to
that.
for
example,
the
decision
of
this
court
are
public
domain
information.
as
a...
they're
preexisting
material.
if,
as
a
compiler,
i
put
together
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
dealing
with
copyright
law,
then
i've
got
a
copyright
in
that
as
a
whole,
but
i
don't
have
a
copyright
in
the
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes,
your
honor,
the
'76
act
included
a
definition
of
compilation
in
section
101
and
included
a
preexisting
fact
provision
in
section
103(b).
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes,
your
honor.
i
didn't
research
that,
but
i
assume
it--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--not
necessarily
the
changes.
maybe
the
changes
were
only
a
clarification,
but
i'm
dependent
upon
the
statute,
the
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes.
i
think
we're...
i
think
my
confusion
is
the
same
as
the
courts
below,
that
is,
this
directory
is
copyrightable
as
a
whole.
we're
not...
we're
not
contesting
the
validity
of
that.
what
we're
saying
is
these
facts
in
this
directory,
this
white
page
list
of
name,
address,
and
telephone
number,
is
available
to
subsequent
compilers.
the
copyright
law--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--as
i
understand
it
is
like...
it's
a
balancing
test
between
the
public's
right
to
information,
public
access,
and
profit
to
an
author.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
directory
is
copyrightable
as
a
whole
even
under
the
'76
act,
because
there
is
copyrightable
provisions
in
here.
there
are
copyrightable
yellow
pages.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
no,
because--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
otherwise
you
take
the
position
that--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--they
have
original
works
of
authorship.
there's
original--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--the
yellow
pages
have
an
original
work
of
authorship.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
if
it's
solely
a
white
page
directory.
this
is
a
combined
directory.
that's
why
we
say
this
directory
is
copyrightable
as
a
whole.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
this
is
the
rural
directory
and
the
rural
directory
is
on
file
with
the
clerk.
so
is
the
feist
directory.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes,
the
feist
directory
is
copyrightable.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
because
it--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--if
it
had
just
white
pages
and
nothing
more?
no.
that's
a
bad
example
in
this
case,
because
there's
some
ads
on
the
white
pages,
too.
but
if
it
had
just
white
pages
and
nothing
more,
no.
it's
simply
an
alphabetical
list
of
name,
address,
and
telephone
number.
it's
available...
it
should
be
available
to
the
public.
the
public
has
access
to
that.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
that
the
name,
address,
and
telephone
number...
my
name,
address,
and
telephone
number
i
assume
is
in
the
public
domain.
once
i...
once
i
make
the--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--it's
available
to
the
public.
i
have
not
paid
the
phone
company
to
have
an
unlisted
number,
so
i've
allowed
the
phone
company
to
give
it
to
the
directory
information
operator,
to
publish
it.
it's
a
preexisting
fact.
i
have
that
name,
address...
that's
my
name,
address,
and
telephone
number.
so
it
has
to
be
public
domain
information.
what
else
can
it
be?
mr.
kyler
knobbe
that...
yes,
that
if
it's
a
fact,
it's
in
the
public
domain.
once
we
publish
a
fact,
that's
part
of
the
public
domain
available
to
any
later
authors.
with
the
court's
permission
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
short
points.
perhaps
when
i
answered
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
directories
were
copyrightable
under
the
1909
act
but
not
under
the
'76
act,
i
misspoke.
our
position
is
that
facts
have
never
been
copyrightable.
a
point
was
made
by
mr.--
mr.
kyler
knobbe
--they're
wrong
under
this
definition
of
the
statute.
sweat
of
the
brow
has
been
rejected
by
the
second
and
the
ninth
circuit.
the
main
cases
cited,
leon
out
of
the
ninth
and
jeweler's
circular
out
of
the
second,
have
both
been
disavowed
by
those
very
circuits.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
yes,
i
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
the
point
was
that
the
information
here
in
this
phone
directory
would
not
exist
without...
but
for
rural
telephone
was
mr.
caplinger's
statement...
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
independent
canvas
theory,
is
that
you
can't
get
it
anywhere
else
except
out
of
the
phone
directory.
you
can't
canvas
it.
it's
like
the
opinions
of
this
court.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
i'll
pass
over
it
then.
mr.
kyler
knobbe
the
final
point
was
that
a
copyright
doesn't
require
inventiveness
like
a
patent
law,
and
i
think
that's
correct,
too.
the
copyright
is
a
limited
monopoly.
it's
not
a
patent
on
those
facts,
ideas,
or
public
domain
information.
thank
you,
your
honor.
