justice
o'connor
counsel,
did
feist
leave
in
its
directory
the
listings
broken
down
by
the
areas
you're
showing
or
did
it
recompile
the
list
into
one
giant
alphabetical
list?
justice
o'connor
it's
not
broken
down
by
the
smaller
areas?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
rural's
white
pages
contain
no
protectable
expression
at
all
and
somebody
like
feist
could
just
xerox
it
and
sell
it
as
its
own?
justice
o'connor
that
isn't
what
was
done
here,
but
you
take
the
position--
justice
o'connor
--it
could
have
been
done.
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
what's
the
statutory
language
that
you
rely
on,
please?
justice
o'connor
and
you
say
that
an
alphabetical
listing
of
phone
numbers
cannot
be
an
original
work
of
authorship?
justice
o'connor
what
about
computer
databases
generally?
same
thing.
justice
o'connor
does--
--isn't
your
position,
mr.
knobbe,
isn't
your
position
that
one
should
identify
the
author
making
the
selection
and
who
made
the
selection
here?
did
the
phone
company
make
it
or
did
the
public
utility
which
required
them
to
list
everyone
make
the
selection?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
does
the...
does
the
statute
require
more
than
just
selection?
what
are
the
register
of
copyright's
guidelines
on
this?
can
a
simply
alphabetical
listing
of
all
the
data
in
a
given
area
meet
the
register's
guidelines
for
what
meets
section
101?
justice
o'connor
what
do
we
have
to
look
at
here?
justice
o'connor
and
does
it
have
to
result
ultimately
in
an
original
work
of
authorship?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
maybe
it's
not
enough
to
focus
on
the
word
"selection".
maybe
the
statute
requires
a
series
of
things.
justice
o'connor
an
original
work
of
authorship?
justice
o'connor
and
how
does
the
register
of
contract...
of
copyright
[inaudible]
this
statute?
justice
o'connor
but
the
yellow
pages
are
copyrightable?
justice
o'connor
well,
because
there
are
yellow
pages
in
it?
justice
o'connor
--in
the
yellow
pages?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
that
a
directory
that
consists
only
of
the
normal
white
pages
is
not
copyrightable
at
all?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
changed,
of
course,
was
the
definition
of
compilation.
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
don't
we
now
have
in
the
'76
act
a
definition
of
compilation
that
we
have
to
look
to?
justice
o'connor
and
we
have
to
apply
that
section,
101,
i
take
it?
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
this
isn't
a
compilation?
justice
o'connor
well,
this
is
a
compilation.
you
concede
that?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
we
don't
have
to
apply
the
definition
in
the
act
of
what
is
a
compilation?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
that's
exactly
where
we'd
look.
justice
o'connor
now,
you
can't
copyright
the
facts
contained
in
the
white
pages,
can
you?
justice
o'connor
so
what
is
to
prevent
feist
from
looking
at
your
directory
and
taking
the
listings
of
names
and
telephone
numbers
and
including
them
in
their
own--
justice
o'connor
--as
factual
material?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
feist
did
was
to
take
the
listings,
names
and
telephone
numbers,
and
use
them
in
their
own
directory.
justice
o'connor
well,
didn't
the
telephone
company,
rural,
simply
make
an
alphabetical
listing
of
all
telephone
subscribers
within
its
geographical
area
covered
by
the
book?
justice
o'connor
isn't
that
what
was
done?
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
it
just
an
alphabetical
listing
by
geographic
area?
justice
o'connor
isn't
that
what
you
have
there?
justice
o'connor
in
the
white
pages?
justice
o'connor
but
they
have
to
start
from
scratch
and
go
door
to
door
and
do
it.
they
can't
draw
the
facts
from
your
white
pages
directory
to
make
their
own
directory.
justice
o'connor
that's
your
position.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
about...
what
about
a
weekly
news
magazine
where
the
reporters
go
out
and
research
some
current
event
like
the
events
that
occurred
during
watergate
and
they
undercover
all
those
facts
and
then
write
about
them.
now,
i
assume
their
expression
is
copyrightable.
but
do
you
think
that
no
one
else
can
resort
to
use
of
the
facts
that
they
uncovered?
justice
o'connor
that
would
be
[inaudible]
composition.
justice
o'connor
of
course
they
can.
any
other
reporter
could
be
just
as
hard
working
and
inventive.
they
could
go
out
and
make
the
same
inquiry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
10th
circuit.
it
requires
us
to
clarify
the
extent
of
copyright
protection
available
to
telephone
directory
white
pages.
the
respondent,
rural
telephone
service
company,
is
a
certified
public
utility
providing
telephone
service
to
several
communities
in
kansas.
pursuant
to
state
regulation,
it
publishes
a
typical
telephone
directory
consisting
of
white
pages
and
yellow
pages.
the
petitioner,
feist
publications,
publishes
a
competing
telephone
directory
covering
a
larger
area.
when
rural
refused
to
license
its
white
pages
listings
to
feist
for
directory
covering
11
different
telephone
service
areas,
feist
copied
more
than
1,300
listings
from
rural's
directory
without
the
consent
of
rural.
rural
sued
for
copyright
infringement.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
kansas
granted
summary
judgment
to
rural,
holding
that
telephone
directories
are
copyrightable
and
that
there
was
infringement.
the
10th
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
we
explained
that
a
fundamental
principle
of
a
copyright
law
is
that
facts
are
not
copyrightable.
this
is
because,
as
a
matter
of
both
constitutional
and
statutory
law,
a
work
qualifies
for
copyright
protection
only
if
it
is
original.
original,
as
that
term
is
used
in
copyright,
means
that
the
work
was
independently
created
by
the
author
and
that
it
possess
a
least
some
minimal
degree
of
creativity.
no
one
may
claim
originality
as
to
facts
because
facts
are
not
created
by
the
author.
they
are
merely
discovered
and
reported.
one
may,
however,
claim
originality
in
the
way
facts
are
selected,
coordinated,
or
arranged.
these
choices
by
an
author,
so
long
as
they
entail
some
minimal
degree
of
creativity,
are
sufficiently
original
to
qualify
for
copyright
protection.
we
conclude
in
this
case
that
feist,
by
taking
1,300
listings
from
rural's
white
pages
did
not
copy
anything
that
was
original
to
rural.
the
bits
of
data
contained
in
the
listings
are
uncopyrightable
facts.
rural
did
not
select,
coordinate,
or
arranged
these
facts
in
an
original
way.
rurals
selection
and
arrangement
were
obvious.
the
list
is
alphabetical
by
name
of
subscriber,
town,
and
telephone
of
each
of
its
subscribers.
this
is
a
frequent
and
age-old
practice
so
common
placed
that
it
has
come
to
be
expected
as
a
manner
of
course.
because
rural's
white
pages
are
the
void
of
creativity,
feist
did
not
violate
the
copyright
laws
by
copying
them.
the
opinion
is
joined
by
eight
members
of
the
court.
justice
blackmun
concurs
in
the
judgment.
