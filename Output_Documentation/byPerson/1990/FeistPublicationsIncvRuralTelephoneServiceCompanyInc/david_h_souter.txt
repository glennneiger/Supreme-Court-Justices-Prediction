justice
souter
well,
if
that's
true,
the
encyclopedia
britannica
just
publishes
facts.
can
you
copy
that?
justice
souter
well,
why
haven't
you
got
it
here?
a
variant
on
justice
scalia's
question
is
even
within
the
service
or
the
phone
company,
all
the
phone
company
publishes
are
the
names
and
addresses
and
numbers
of
people
who
subscribe
to
phone
service.
they
don't
publish
the
listing
of
everyone
who
lives
in
that
town.
that's
a
selection.
that's
not
publishing
all
the
facts
about
the
people
in
that
town.
it's
publishing
facts
only
about
people
who
subscribe
to
phone
service.
justice
souter
isn't
the
difference
that
you
can
find
out
who
the
members
of
the
court
are
without
having
to
consult
that
card.
the
fact
it's
available
elsewhere?
whereas
if
we
were
a
secret
court
and
the
only
way
you
could
find
our
who
we
were
would
be
by
looking
at
a
chart
published
by
some
third
party,
that
chart
would
be
copyrightable
insofar
as
it
was
a
compilation
of
the
names,
wouldn't
it?
justice
souter
okay,
well,
in
this
case,
you're
not
publishing
facts
which
are
generally
available
to
you
through
sources
that
you
use.
you're
simply
publishing
the
compilation
itself
or
a
portion
of
the
compilation
as
distinguished
from
the
situation
you
would
be
in
if
you
went
out
on
the
streets
and
stopped
at
every
house
and
said,
do
you
have
a
phone?
if
so,
what
is
your
number?
you'd
have
to
do
that
in
order
to
get
into
the
situation
that
you're
in
when
you
use
the
analogy
of
the
supreme
court
seating
chart.
justice
souter
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
anyone
claims
that
to
be
the
case.
justice
souter
sure,
you're
got
the
right
to
publish
it.
the
question
is
have
you
got
the
right
to
public...
have
you
got
the
right
to
publish
it
by
copying
their
directory
when
that's
the
only
way
you
get
it?
you
don't
otherwise
go
out
and
find
the
fact
yourself.
that's
what
raises
the
copyright
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
you
made
the
remark
a
moment
ago,
i
think
at
the
time
ou
were
holding
up
the
rural
directory,
that
all
of
the
listing
information
in
there
was
in
the
public
domain.
what
is
your
reason
for
saying
that?
justice
souter
what
do
you
mean
by
that
statement?
justice
souter
well,
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
how
you're
using
the
term.
you
seem
to
be
using
the
term
to
mean
that
if
the
subject
matter
of
information
consents
to
its
publication,
then
anything
which
publishes
that
information
is
in
the
public
domain.
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
souter
but
isn't
the
problem
under
103(b)
and
the
problem
for
the
sweat-of-the-brow
theory
that
it
provides
that
the
protection
extends
only
to
the
material
contributed
by
the
author
and
doesn't
the
word
material
imply
something
different
from
effort?
doesn't
it
imply
something
about
the
content
of
the
work?
justice
souter
well,
this...
i'm
not
talking
about
preexisting
material.
i'm
talking
about
the
phrase
that
the
copyright
and
the
compilation
of
derivative
work
extends
only
to
the
material
contributed
by
the
author.
what
is
the
material
contributed
by
the
author?
doesn't
that
phrase
imply
that
there
is
something
about
the
content
of
the
work
rather
than
the
process
of
compiling
the
work
that
is
subject
to
protection?
justice
souter
well,
it's
still...
unless
i'm
not
parsing
the
sentence
right,
i
think
the
sentence
is
still
providing
that
the
copyright
in
a
compilation
or
derivative
work,
but
in
a
compilation
extends
only
to
the
material
contributed
by
the
author.
and
my
suggestion
is
that
material
implies
something
about
the
content
of
the
work
rather
than
something
about
the
effort
that
goes
into
producing
the
work.
my
question
is,
number
1,
is
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
provision,
and
number
2,
if
it
is,
what
is
the
material
in
your
directory
that
is
contributed
by
the
author?
justice
souter
yes,
but
that's
not
material.
justice
souter
that's
effort.
it's
thought,
but
it's
not
material.
it's
not
something
that's
on
the
page.
justice
souter
you're
saying
the
arrangement
is
not
preexisting.
justice
souter
right.
justice
souter
does
material
imply
arrangement?
in
other
words
does...
it
seems
to
me
they're
talking
about
content,
not
order.
justice
souter
let
me,
if
i
may,
interrupt
you.
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question.
was
this
particular
phrase
that
i'm
concerned
with
added
at
the
time
of
the
amendment
or
was
that
in
the
preexisting
law?
justice
souter
yes,
the
phrase
referring
to
material
contributed
by
the
author.
was
that
new?
justice
souter
if
it
was
new,
it
could
very
well
have
had
an
effect
on
the
extent
to
which
the
preexisting
law,
which
we
assume
provides
for
copyright
of
such
a
directory,
survived
the
amendment,
wouldn't
it?
mr.
caplinger,
before
you
sit
down,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what
is
the
status
of
the
antitrust
aspect
of
this
case?
