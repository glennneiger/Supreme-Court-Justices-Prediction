mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there's
two
issues
that
i
would
like
to
address
in
my
argument
today.
number
1
is
whether
the
rural
telephone
directory
is
copyrightable
and
specifically
including
the
white
page
listing
section.
and
number
2,
whether
feist's
substantial
copying
of
this
white
page
listing
information
in
the
copyrighted
directory
is
an
act
of
copyright
infringement.
since
this
case
hinges
on
statutory
interpretation,
the
1976
copyright
act,
i
thought
i
would
start
right
there.
section
102(a)
of
the
1976
copyright
act
states
in
part
that
copyright
extends
to
original
works
of
authorship
fixed
in
any
tangible
means
of
expression.
there
were
some
questions
of
mr.
knobbe
as
to
did
the
law
change
in
1976
in
any
way.
the
house
report
setting
out
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
1970
act...
'76
act...
states,
the
phrase,
quote,
1909
copyright
act.
nothing
changed
in
the
way
of
copyrightability
of
telephone
directories
or
other--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--the--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
the--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--no,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
no.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
this
is
a
compilation,
but
as
the
lower
courts
and
other
courts
have
unanimously
found
that
a
telephone
directory
is
copyrightable
under
two
sections,
section
102
of
the
'76
copyright
act
and
103.
section
102,
where
i
stated
copyright
extends
to
original
works
of
authorship,
the
congressional
intent
sets
out...
well,
if
you
look
at
section
102(a),
it
goes
on
to
include
various
items,
one
of
which
is
102(a)(1)
literary
works.
and
on
the
house
report,
page
54,
setting
out
the
congressional
intent,
congress
said
the
term,
quote,
"literary
works",
end
quote,
does
not
connote
any
criterion
of
literary
merit
or
qualitative
value.
it
includes
catalogs,
directories,
and
similar
factual
reference
or
instructional
works
and
compilations
of
data.
and
that's
why
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
said
that
rural's
telephone
directory
is
copyrightable
under
section
102
or
103.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
yes,
and
in
[inaudible]--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
you
have
to,
but
i
would
recommend
that
the
court
do...
do
so.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
what...
what
i
was
saying
that
you
can
look
under
either
one.
directories
are
included
in
102,
but
we'd
also
say
that
it's
included
under
103.
and
103
was
added
in
1976
to
encompass...
well,
i
take
that
back.
the
1909,
the
previous
federal
copyright
act,
specifically
set
out
directories.
and
i
believe
that
in
my
interpretation
of
the
legislative
intent,
because
of
the
creation
of
so
many
different
types
of
catalogues,
encyclopedias,
and
directories,
especially
in
light
of
new
technology
encyclopedias.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
no.
what
is--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
the...
justice
o'connor--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
we
are
not
alleging
that
the
copyright
in
the
telephone
directory
extends
to
the
names...
to
the
particular
name
and
particular
number.
what
a
copyright
and
a
compilation
extends
to
is
the...
is
to
the
work
of
authorship
on
the
part
of
the
author.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
yes,
and
justice
o'connor,
i'm
saying
that
the
white
page
listings
are
not
preexisting
material.
the
name
by
itself.
the
address
by
itself.
but
without
the
telephone
company
being
author
of
compiling
and
creating
a
listing...
when
i
say
listing
it
means
all
here--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--that--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
that
was
one
part
of
the
selection.
i
think
that
to...
to
fully
answer
your
question,
let's
look
right
at
103,
the
definition
of
a
compilation.
and
a
compilation
is
a
work
formed
by
the
collection
and
the
assembly
of
preexisting
materials
or
of
data
that
are
selected,
coordinated,
or
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
the
resulting
work
as
a
whole
constitutes
an
original
work
of
authorship.
what
rural
telephone...
just
like
any
other
telephone
company...
they
on
a
day-to-day
basis
gather,
collect,
and
assemble
a
lot
of
information
about
the
subscriber.
the
addresses,
the
towns,
the
types
of
equipment,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
there's
a
lot
of
information
they
receive.
then
what
they
do
is
then
they
turn
and
they
make
the
subjective
decision
of
how
to
select,
how
to
coordinate,
and
how
to
arrange
that
and
how
to
create
something
that's
a
useable--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--in
this
particular
area,
yeah,
that
was
the
decision
to--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--in
this
particular--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--yes,
in
this
particular
annual
directory
we
decided
to
put
out
the
rural
subscriber
listing
in
alphabetical
order.
but
we
have
20...
we
have
26
different
exchanges.
and
if
you
look
back
on
that
same
map
that
the
court
was
looking
at
earlier,
we
have
three
distinct,
noncontiguous
geographic
areas
and
that
rural
telephone
made
the
decision
to...
not...
to
put
out
one
directory.
it
could
have
put
out
26
directories.
it
decided
also
in
putting
out
one
alphabetical
directory
for
its
white
page
listings,
to
do
that
not
by
town
but
to
do
it
interlocking,
include
all
of
the
towns,
all
of
the
telephone
exchanges.
it
very
well
could
have
put
out
26
different
directories--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--that's
one
of
many
that
the
telephone
company
subjectively
decides,
or
decision-making
which
the
compilation
as
a
whole
copyrightable,
not
the
bits
and
pieces.
and
i--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--separate.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--we've--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--we
decided
to,
instead
of...
we
decided
to
put
them
in
one
list
instead
of
26
telephone
exchanges.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
communities.
we
decided
to
include
business
listings
within
this.
we
decided
that
in
some
communities
we
only
put
the
town
where
in
other
communities
we
put
the
full
address.
we
also
decide
what
name,
because
my
full
name
might
be
a
fact.
but
i
go
by
several
names,
james,
jim,
jay,
jr,
et
cetera.
and--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
the
congressional
intent
behind
that
says
that
the...
in
dealing
with
the
standard
of
original
works
of
authorship,
it
says
this
standard
does
not
include
requirements
in
novelty,
ingenuity,
or
aesthetic
merit.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
yes.
yes,
and
those
decisions.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
require
anything
unique
or
novel.
all
directories
out
there
are
made
upon
facts.
that's
what
a
directory
is.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
what
makes
that
original
is
how
you
use
those
facts
and
how
you
present
those
facts.
that's
where
it
creates
an
original
work
of
authorship.
if
it's
simply...
take
the
idea
that,
well,
all
this
is
is
a
book
of
facts.
all
directories,
and
the
encyclopedia
included,
are
a
compilation.
that's
what
a
compilation
is.
these
are
books
of
facts.
what
makes
them
original
is
how
the
author
arranges
that
information
and
that's
where
i
believe
that
the
petitioner
here
has
tried
to
create
this
split
in
the
lower
courts.
i
don't
see
a
split
in
the
lower
courts.
what
you
have
is
this...
supposedly
this
sweat-of-the-brow
theory
on
one
side,
and
the
original
act
of
authorship
on
the
other
side.
the
original
or
the
sweat
of
the
brow
is
where
the
author
gathers,
collects,
and
assembles.
he
gathers
all
this
factual
information.
but
if
he
doesn't
then
somehow
make
a
decision
on
how
to
put
that
in
a
compilation,
it's
not...
it's
not
a
useable
compilation.
you
have
to
make...
after
you
collect
this
the
sweat
of
the
brow
and
you
have
all--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--no.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
justice
scalia,
that
is...
that
is
one
step.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
at--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
that's...
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
reason
that
congress
added
that
language
is
that
if
somebody
goes
out
and
researches
and
accumulates
a
lot
of
facts,
that
alone,
the
labor
of
collecting
and
assembling,
you
can't
copyright
that.
what
authorship
is
there?
what
creates
the
original
work
is
what
you
do
with
the
information
that
you've
gathered,
collected,
and
assembled.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
and--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
justice
scalia--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
the...
i
know
that
alphabetizing
this
list
doesn't
take
a
lot
of
thought,
but
there
are
other
things
that
went
into
this
and
in
fact
if
it
wasn't
for
rural
telephone
being
the
author
of
this,
this
information
would
not
exist.
yes,
the
names,
addresses,
and
numbers
are
floating
out
there
in
bits
and
pieces,
but
they
could
still
be
floating
until
rural
telephone
took
that
information,
decided...
selected
what
it
was
going
to
include
in
the
directory,
how
it
was
going
to
coordinate
that
directory,
and
how
it
was
going
to
arrange
that
information.
and
just
because
it
is...
it
appears
to
be
simple,
it
still
meets
the
test
under
the
1976
act.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
in
your
hypothetical
there,
did
he
make
a
subjective
decision
on
his
selection
of
what
information
he
was
going
to--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--okay,
that's
one
part
of
it.
and
then
he...
if
he
makes
a
subjective
decision
on
how
he's
going
to
arrange
that
to--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
that
was
his
subjective
decision.
he
could
have
put
it
backwards.
he
could
have
made
a
cross-reference.
he
could
put
it
upside
down.
he
made
the
decision.
what
the
copyright
law...
it
doesn't
require
inventiveness--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--like
the
patent
copyright
law,
because
if...
well,
let
me
go
back
a
second
here.
this
book,
the
white
page
listings,
are
copyrightable.
but
that
doesn't
prevent,
like
patent
law
or
something,
from
somebody
else
doing
the
same
work.
they
can
acquire
the
same
names,
addresses,
towns,
numbers--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--justice
o'connor--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
under
the
copyright
law
they
cannot
wait
till
we
publish
this
directory
and
then
copy
this
information.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
no.
i
agree.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
no.
because
those
facts
cannot
be
independently
duplicated.
i
think
that
that
analysis
is
like
harper--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
excuse
me,
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
like
the
harper
and
row
case
of
this
court
in
1985,
and
in
that
particular
case
it
involved
a
statement
by
gerald...
president
gerald
ford.
and
the
second
publisher
used
that
identical
factual
information,
and
this
court
had
to
go
in
depth
in
fair
use
section
of
this
copyright
act.
and
i
think
what
the
concerns
of
this
court
were
at
that
time
was
that
there's
only
one
statement
made
by
the
president,
how
can
it
be
duplicated.
in
this
particular
situation,
this
information
as
well
as
then
apparently
in
your
hypothetical,
if
the
other
person
can
go
out
on
their
own
and
collect
that
information
and
express
it
in
their
own
fashion,
and
even
if,
after
their
own
independent
work,
if
it
comes
out
identical,
that's
still
not
copyright
infringement.
the
copyright...
the
telephone
company
directory
copyright
does
not
extend
to
the
names
and
addresses
listed
there
but
rather
the
compilation
of
the
same,
because
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
other
party
from
doing
the
same.
whereas
in
patent
law,
if
feist
invented
something
at
the
same
time
that
rural
invented
it.
whoever
finished
inventing
that
first
has
a
monopoly
on
it
forever.
but
in
copyright
law,
if
they
both
go
out
and
independently
create
something
and
it
just
happens
that
it's...
it
comes
out
identical
or
substantially
identical,
there's
no
copyright
infringement
there.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
white
page
listings
information
would
not
be
here
but
for
the
telephone
company
gathering,
collecting,
and
making
a
decision
how
to
put
this
directory
out
and
in
fact
each
year
it
differs.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
justice
marshall,
the
telephone
company.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
yes.
if
it
wasn't...
if
it
wasn't
for
the
telephone
company,
this
directory
wouldn't
exist.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
justice
marshall,
an
author
could
be
a
individual,
a
corporation,
an
entity
who--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
customarily
when
you
look
at
artwork--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--that's
questionable,
but--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
justice
marshall,
maybe
i
can...
and
i
know
this
court
in
getting
prepared
to
argue
here
today,
they
would
like
to
hear
how
not
only
the
law
would
be
affected
by
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
the
industry
nationwide.
i
think
that
if
you
went
to
new
york
city
and
you
took
nynex,
who
spent
$2
million
a
year
putting
this
information
together.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
well...
that...
justice
marshall,
i
know
that's
the
position,
you
know,
when
you're
representing
the
telephone
company,
everybody
hates
the
telephone
company
and
utilities.
but
back
to
my
point
is
if--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--if--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--if
this
court
were
to
find
that
because
the
bits...
individual
bits
and
pieces
of
this
information
in
a
directory
are
factual
in
nature
and
that
the
author's
work
of
creating
that
directory,
collecting,
assembling,
and
making
the
decisions
on
how
to
put
that
out,
if
a
defense
would
fly
that,
well,
i'll
wait
until
you
put
it
out
and
spend
$100,000
doing
that
and
then
i'll
just
copy
it,
like
they
did
in
this
case--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--justice
stevens,
yes--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
we're
told
by
the
kansas
corporation
commission
to
annually
publish
a
directory.
it
doesn't
say
what's
to
be
include
in
that
directory.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
justice
stevens,
yes.
and
in
fact
in
subsequent
years
this
directory
is
different.
it
goes
back
to
what
i
was
saying
earlier--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--because
of
the...
of
this
white
page
listing
section
could
have
been
set
out
in
26
different
alphabetical
sections
of
the...
encompassing
the
same
listings
because...
in
fact
we
have
people
that
say
that
we're
completely
on
the
other
side
of
western
kansas--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--i
would
like
to
have
you
prepare
your
book
to
where
you
have
the
same
listings,
however,
i'd
like
a
through
z
for
agra,
a
through
z
for
bolta--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--yes--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--yes,
and
that
would
be
a
decision
for
them.
i
know
it
hard
to
stand
here
and
try
to
say...
and
try
to
build
something,
because
i
don't
believe
the
alphabet
or
alphabetizing
something
takes
a
genius
of
a
great
work
of
an
author.
but
that's
just
one
of
a
number
of
things
that
the
author
of
this
directory
makes
a
decision
on.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
yes,
justice
stevens,
the
copyright
law
expresses
our
contribution
by
the
author
of
creating
this
and
those
listings...
how
those
listings
are
listed
there--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
justice
stevens,
to
answer
that
question,
there's
a
market
for
this
information
that
if
we
do
not
put
accurate,
complete
listing
information,
we're
not
going
to
sell
the
yellow
page
advertising.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
and
in
northwest
kansas,
the
revenue
from
this
directory
and
from
the
yellow
and
white--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--goes
back
to...
goes
into
the
rate
base
to
keep
the
rates
or
affect
the
rates
to
the
subscribers
and
the
owner-members
of
this
coop.
so
you
asked--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
company
did.
i
think
that
for
their
service,
since
this
company...
it's
a
nonprofit
coop
and
it's
owned
by
its
members,
they
would
take
whatever
steps,
copyrightable
or
not
copyrightable,
to
provide
an
up-to-date,
accurate
telephone
directory.
but
it--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--that's
right.
but
it
would
be
disturbing
and
it
would
turn
the
federal
copyright
law
as
directories
straight
up
on
top
of
its
head
is...
if
somebody
is
allowed
to
wait
until
somebody
puts
out
a
compilation
and
then
say,
well,
all
we
have
to
do...
all
we
have
to
do
is
dump
that
information
into
our
computer
and
we'll
rearrange
it
with
the
stroke
of
a
computer
key
and
then
we'll
copyright
it
ourselves.
and
in
fact,
white
page
listing
information,
there's
a
market
for
it.
they
sell--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
we...
there
is--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
there
is
revenue
produced
from
the
white
page
listings.
we
sell
advertising
in
the
white
pages
in
the
way
of
bold
print.
we
get
revenue
from
that.
extra
listings
we
charge.
so
there
is...
the
white
pages
are
revenue
producing
on
their
own.
but
in
reality
you
are
correct.
without
up-to-date
accurate
white
page
listings,
the
yellow
pages...
it
would
be
difficult
to
maintain
sales.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
every...
excuse
me,
justice
white,
every
single
case
since
the
landmark
case
of
leon
in
'37
to
the
most
recent
case
of
the
united
telephone
are...
illinois
bell--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--leon.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
1937.
they
call
it
the
landmark
telephone
copyright
case.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
justice--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--that's...
justice
white,
that's
exactly
right
and
in
fact--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--justice
kenney,
in
my
opinion
of
103
was
set
out--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--i
mean,
justice
kennedy.
it
was
set
out
to
show
that
the
person
who
goes
out
and
collects
factual
information
just
because
he
collects
factual
information
and
the
work
as
a
whole
in
a
compilation
is
a
protected
work,
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
now
own
a
copyright
on
those
noncopyrightable
bits
of
information,
such
as
somebody's
name.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
justice
souter,
my
opinion
as
to
what
preexisting
material
means
is
preexisting
fact--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
justice
souter,
i
think
you
have
to
go
back.
103
applies
to
two
separate
works.
there's
what
is
known
as
collective
work,
and
that's
what's
at
issue
here,
and
then
there's
a
derivative
work.
and
a
derivative
work
is
where...
and
this
might
sound
strange
but
since
this
is
at
issue...
if
we
take
this
copyrighted
telephone
directory
and
make
it
into
a
movie.
it's
where
you
take
a
book
and
transform
it
to
something
else
like
a
movie.
they're
saying
that
even
though
you
change
it,
that
the
preexisting
is
still,
you
know,
copyrighted
or
copyrightable.
maybe
i'm
not
understanding
your
question.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
okay,
justice
souter,
to
answer
that
question
is
that
the...
again,
the
bits
of
factual
information
alone
are
not
copyrightable.
what
the
contribution
is
of
the
author
in
the
form
of
collective
work
of
a
compilation
is
the
hard
work
or
labor
as
you
put
it.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
but
the--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--well,
the
preexisting...
what
we're
saying
is
not
preexisting
material
is
the
listing
information.
and
we
are
the
author
of
putting
that
together.
we
decided--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--and
that's
part
of--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--the
second
part
of
the
definition.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
well,
the
'76
laws
have
dealt
with...
deals
with
directories.
it's
just
a
compilation
or
collection
of
material
or
factual...
factual
material
and
that--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--103(b)?
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
section--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--the
antitrust
case--
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
--it
is
presently
on
appeal
before
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
no.
i
filed
rural's
opening
brief
a
week
ago
and
mr.
knobbe's
brief
is
due
the
first
of
march.
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
a
city
directory?
mr.
james
m.
caplinger,
jr.
that's
true,
and
you
go
back
to
the
landmark
case
that
i
referred
to
earlier,
leon.
that's
where
a
second
publisher
took
the
alphabetized
information
and
flipped
it
around
and
put
it
by
telephone
number
and
not
a
through
z.
and
the
court
said
that
that
was
still
a
taking
of
the
work
of
a
telephone
company
because
they're
the
original
author
of
that
white
page
listing
information.
and
also
the
most
recent
case,
illinois
bell--
