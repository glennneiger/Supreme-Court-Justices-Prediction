justice
stevens
it
seems
it
would
help
you
if
it
were.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
because
if
they
are
the
selector,
then
the
publisher
of
the
directory
has
not
contributed
a
bit
of
authorship
to
the
compilation.
it's
quite
different
from
the
encyclopedia
britannica
or
something
else
where
the
author
decides
what
to
go
in.
here
the
utility...
the
regulatory
agency
decided
what
would
be
selected.
justice
stevens
well,
just
looking
at
the
white
pages
alone
you's
still
have
the
same
number
of
telephone
books,
wouldn't
you?
because
you've
got
a...
your
corporation
commission
compels
you
to
publish
a
telephone
directory
annually.
so
even
if
you
don't
have
it
copyrighted,
you're
going
to
have
to
do
it.
justice
stevens
and
i
suppose
you're
going
to
have
to
do
it
alphabetically,
because
otherwise
nobody
can
use
it.
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
do
you
suppose
any
other
form
of
directory
would
satisfy
their
requirement?
have
you
ever
seen
a
telephone
directory
of
a
different
form
than
this
one?
that
is,
the
white
pages?
justice
stevens
in
what
respect
does
it
differ?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
stevens
i
see.
so
that's
your
selection.
justice
stevens
it's
not
the
alphabetizing,
it's
if
you
had
a
single
telephone
company
with
just
one
area
of
service
like
the
city
of
chicago
and
nothing
else,
say,
then
it
would
have...
there
would...
the
same
telephone
directory
would
have
to
be
published
year
after
year.
justice
stevens
well,
what
other
than
the
selection
of
which
areas
of
service
to
be
included
in
the
directory
would
be
different
if
we
held
it
was
not
copyrightable?
in
fact,
why
would
your
decision
be
any
different,
whether
it's
copyrightable
or
not
in
your
decision
of
whether
to
have
one
directory
for
all
areas
of
service
or
several
different
directories?
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
copyrighted
or
not?
justice
stevens
well,
does
the
copyright
law
protection
have
any
impact
at
all
on
your
decision
as
to
how
to
assemble
the
white
pages?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
my
question
is
would
you
create
them
any
differently
if
there
were
no
copyright
law
protection?
and
if
so,
why.
justice
stevens
well--
justice
stevens
--from
the
yellow
pages.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
true
whether
or
not
there's
copyright
protection.
it
seems
to
me
it's
equally
true
whether
or
not
there's
copyright
protection.
the
only
thing
your
copyright
protection
does,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
give
you
a
right
to
collect
royalties
from
people
who
want
to
publish
the
same
information
and
make
it
more
broadly
available
to
the
public.
at
least
that's
all
i
can
see.
may
i
ask
you--
justice
stevens
--sure,
because
they
want
people
to
use
the
service.
justice
stevens
and
how
does
that...
i
understand
that
it
may
intrude
on
your
revenues
from
the
advertising
yellow
pages,
but
otherwise
it
doesn't
have
any
impact
on
your
business
at
all,
does
it?
justice
stevens
you're
trying
to
use
your
copyright
on
the
white
pages
to
protect
your
business...
the
business
interest
in
the
advertising
in
the
yellow
pages.
that's
what's
at
stake
here,
isn't
it?
