justice
kennedy
did
feist's
directory
show
the
name
of
the
city
or
the
name
of
the
town?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
you
wanted
to
look
up
this
person
and
you
looked
him
up,
could
you
see
not
only
his
phone
number--
justice
kennedy
--and
his
street
address,
but
then
there
would
be
a
little--
justice
kennedy
--designation
like
ob
for
oberlon
or
something?
justice
kennedy
but
would
the
address
show
the
town?
justice
kennedy
and
so
that
had
to
be
added,
i
take
it,
to
the
listing
that
was
in
the
phone
directory,
because
the
phone
directory
would
not
have
the
name
of
the
town
after
each
little--
justice
kennedy
--after
each
address.
justice
kennedy
all
right.
justice
kennedy
in
each
listing
or
is
the
town
just
at
the
top
of
the
page?
justice
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
the
question
this
way.
what
are
the...
are
there
any
differences
between
each
individual
listing
in
the
feist
directory
and
in
the
phone
book
directory?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
justice
kennedy
and
somebody
could
do--
--you
say
it's
not
a
compilation
at
all?
justice
kennedy
what
about
the...
what
about
telephone
yellow
pages?
justice
kennedy
how
about
telephone
books?
justice
kennedy
well,
a
lot
of
telephone
directories--
justice
kennedy
--are
not
subject
from
them.
they're
just
white
pages.
justice
kennedy
you
think
they're
wrong
about...
in
granting
copyrights
on
that
or
in
registering
them?
justice
kennedy
--and
is
the
feist
directory
copyrightable?
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
if
it
had
just
the
white
pages...
if
you
had
just
white
pages?
justice
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
that's
the
component
of
originality
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
if
we
can
assume,
and
i
think
it's
true,
that
the
name
and
the
address
and
the
number
are
a
fact
that's
not
copyrightable--
justice
kennedy
--what
elements
of
originality
have
you
added
to
those
facts
that
make
this
a
work
of
original
authorship
under
101?
justice
kennedy
you've
said...
you've
told
us
one
of
the
things,
and
that
is
you've
selected
the
counties
in
this
yellow
area.
what
else?
justice
kennedy
you've
alphabetized,
which
i
think
we
could
talk
about,
but
i
don't
think
that's
very
original.
what
else?
justice
kennedy
well,
that
just
repeats
what
you
said
before.
all
right.
justice
kennedy
i'm
not
stunned
by
the
originality
so
far.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
yes,
but
it
must
constitute
an
original
work
of
authorship?
justice
kennedy
well,
a
dictionary
of
quotations...
there's
nothing
original
in
it
in
the
sense
of
having
created
something.
justice
kennedy
well,
does
that
bring
us
to
section
103?
could
you
spend
a
little
time
going
through
section
103
with
us,
because
i
take
it
feist's
argument
is
that
even
if
this
is
copyrightable,
the
information
can
still
be
taken
subject
to
103(b).
am
i
correct
that
that's
the
argument?
justice
kennedy
is
section
103(a)
an
addition
to
the
1976
act
in
103(b)?
