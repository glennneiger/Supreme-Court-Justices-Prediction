justice
scalia
so
i
assume
that
somebody
could
just
come
in
and
xerox
your
directory
and
sell
it,
right?
justice
scalia
you're
in
a
pretty
precarious
business
there.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
well,
i
mean,
there
is
certainly
some
selection.
if
you're
adverting
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
there
certainly
has
been
some
selection
here,
hasn't
there,
of
names?
their
directory
selected
only
the
names
of
people
in
the
yellow
areas.
justice
scalia
well,
it
may
well
be,
but
that's
a
selection.
they
didn't
publish
anybody
else's
subscribership.
that's
a
selectionship,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
sure,
i've
just
chosen
to
publish
my
entire
list
and
not
somebody
else's
list.
why
isn't
that
selection?
justice
scalia
i
could
have
done
what
you
did.
they,
they
could
have
decided
to
put
out
a
directory
for
the
whole
thing.
they
didn't.
they
said,
we're
going
to
be
more
selective.
we're
only
going
to
publish
a
list
of
the
people
in
our
[inaudible].
now
you
may
think
that's
not
a
very...
what
should
i
say...
inventive
selection,
but
it
is
a
selection,
is
it
not?
justice
scalia
well,
okay,
so
what
it
comes
to,
it
has
to
be
the
kind
of
a
selection
that
causes...
that
causes
the
whole
thing
to
be
a
work
of
authorship.
justice
scalia
where
do
we
look
for
that...
for
what
kind
of
a
selection
causes
something
to
be
a
work
worth
of
authorship?
justice
scalia
creativity?
is
that
what
has
to
go
into
it?
justice
scalia
no?
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
when
you
say
selection--
justice
scalia
--when
you
say
select
the
whole
range
of
data,
you're
begging
the
question.
i
mean,
deciding
what
the
range
is
is
itself
a
selection.
you
can
decide
to
publish
all
the
restaurants
in
town
or
you
can
decide
to
publish
just
the
100
best
restaurants.
but
either
one
is
a
selection.
you
could
have
chosen
instead
of
all
the
best
restaurants
in
town,
all...
or
instead
of
all
the
restaurants
in
town,
all
the
restaurants
in
the
county,
or
all
the
restaurants
in
the
state.
no,
i'm
going
to
be
more
selective.
people
aren't
interested
in
all
the
restaurants
in
the
state,
just
all
the
restaurants
in
the
city.
that's
a
selection.
now,
why
is
that
selection
in
your
view
not
copyrightable.
but
if
i
say,
because
i
know
what
your
view
is...
if
i
say
just
the
best
restaurants
in
town,
that
is.
now
why...
what's
the
difference
between
those
two?
justice
scalia
but
i
just
said--
justice
scalia
--it
doesn't
publish
everything.
i'm
just
publishing
the
restaurants
in
this
city.
i've
made
the
judgment
that--
justice
scalia
--a
list
of
all
the
restaurants
in
the
state
would
be
useless
to
people.
but
i
know
a
lot
of
people
that
would
want
to
know
all
the
restaurants
in
the
state
capital.
so
i'm
being
selective
to
that
extent.
that's
a
selection.
justice
scalia
not
all
the
facts.
justice
scalia
just
the
restaurants
in
the
state
capital.
i've
excluded
restaurants
elsewhere.
that's
a
selection,
isn't
it?
you
will
not
concede
that
that's
a
selection?
justice
scalia
he
has
to
say,
ah-hah,
i
am
going
to
put
this
in
there
alphabetically.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
he
has
to
make
that
further
step.
justice
scalia
well,
my,
my,
that's--
justice
scalia
--you
think...
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
here
a
statutory
definition
that
is
obviously
a
definition
of
art.
if
you
wanted
the
common
meaning
of
compilation,
you
would
have
stopped
that
definition
right
after
the
first
phrase.
it
would
read
a
compilation
is
a
work
formed
by
the
collection
and
assembling
of
preexisting
materials,
period.
that's
the
normal
meaning
of
compilation.
but
the
act
goes
on
with
malice
aforethought
and
adds
to
that
"that
are
selected,
coordinated,
or
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
the
resulting
work
as
a
whole
constitutes
an
original
work
of
authorship.
"
all
of
that
is
added
to
tell
us
something
and
i
think
it's
telling
us
something
more
than
it
has
to
be
in
alphabetical
form.
it's
an
awful
lot
of....
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
what
has
to
be
done
is
it
has
to
be
either
selected,
coordinated,
or
arranged.
but
it
doesn't
even
end
there.
it
doesn't
say
they
have
to
be
selected,
coordinated...
but
they
have
to
be
selected,
coordinated,
or
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
the
resulting
work
as
a
whole
constitutes
an
original
work
of
authorship.
and
we're
being
asked
in
this
case
to
give
content
to
what
that
means:
"in
such
a
way
that
the
resulting
work
constitutes
an
original
work
of
authorship.
"
justice
scalia
and
what...
original...
you--
justice
scalia
--disclaim
any
inventiveness
or
novelty
or
anything
else
in
that?
justice
scalia
well,
the
fact
that
it
wouldn't
be
available
proves
not...
i
mean
you
can
say
that
of
any
collection
and
assembling
of
preexisting
materials.
your
client
could
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
gathering
all
this
material
together.
or
take
a
researcher
in
some
scientific
field
who
spends
years
assembling
all
sorts
of
data.
and
he
has
all
the
data.
let's
assume
he
has
even
stored
all
the
data
alphabetically
and
then
he
dies.
now,
is
that...
was
that
a
copyrightable
work?
justice
scalia
it
would
take
a
lot
of
time
to
reduplicate
all
the
research
he's
done.
justice
scalia
of
course,
anyone
who
selects
data
does
that.
justice
scalia
alphabetically
he
decided.
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
that's
very
interesting,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
has
anything
whatever
to
do
with
whether
it's
a
copyrighted...
i
mean,
that's
a
good
argument
for
congress.
justice
scalia
i'll
make
an
exception
for
this.
