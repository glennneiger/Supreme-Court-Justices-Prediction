general
starr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
general
starr.
ms.
karlan,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
may
answer
the
question,
ms.
karlan,
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
karlan.
mr.
pugh,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
pugh,
is
there
some
accepted
explanation
for
why
some
of
the
seats
on
the
supreme
court
are
geographically...
by
geographic
regions,
and
others
are
at
large?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
proposal
was
to
move
from
five
geographic
districts
to
have
all
seven
by
geographic
districts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
was--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--six?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
pugh--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you
don't
agree,
then,
that
before
the
amendments
in
1982
judges
were
covered
by
the
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
judges
were
covered
under
the
applicable
standard
of
the
act
before
the
1982
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
then
it
wasn't
such
a
dramatic
change,
as
you
say,
to
say
that
they
would
continue
to
be
covered
after
the
1982
amendments.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
so
is
everybody
else
brand
new
covered
for
the
purpose
of
that
results
test.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pugh.
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
starr,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
have
we
held
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
does
that
mean
to
say
it
may
be
taken
into
account
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances?
does
that
mean
that
a
particular
district
court
in
louisiana
could
say
louisiana
can
go
ahead
the
way
it
is,
and
a
particular
district
court
in
mississippi
could
say
no,
mississippi
can't
go
ahead
the
way
it
is,
and
each
one
would
be
ultimately
affirmed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
not
but
perhaps
yes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
