justice
white
well,
wasn't,
white
against
regester
was
based
on
the
equal
protection
clause,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
so
it
was
a
constitutional
law
case.
justice
white
and
what
happened
to
white
against
regester
in
bolden,
do
you
think?
justice
white
what
happened
to
it
in
the
bolden
case?
justice
white
but
what
happened
to
the
white
against
regester,
if
anything?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--do
you
think
the
vote
dilution
part
of
white
against
regester
survived
bolden
as
a
constitutional
matter?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
i
know,
but
what
was
the
congress'
authority
to
pass
section
2,
the
amendment
to
section
2?
justice
white
you
think
it
was
the
fifteenth?
could
it
be
the
fourteenth,
or
what?
justice
white
even
though
bolden
said
there
was
no
such
equal
protection
requirement
in
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
white
so,
but
congress
has
the
authority
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
a
way
that
the
court
said
wasn't
required?
justice
white
does
it
incorporate,
in
your
view,
our
holding
in
thornburg
and
gingles?
justice
white
what
have
these
numbers
got
to
do
with
the
legal
issue
here?
justice
white
which
requires
an
intent.
justice
white
you
suggest
that
the
congress
didn't
use
legislator
and
used
representative
in
order
to
cover
the
executive
branch?
justice
white
what...
let's
just
take
louisiana
for
example.
justice
white
let's
say
that
section
2(a)
could
apply
to
the
executive
branch
in
louisiana.
justice
white
give
me
an
example
of
an
office
to
which
it
would
apply
that
isn't
a
one-person
office,
and
indivisible
office.
justice
white
school
boards?
justice
white
is
that
about
it?
justice
white
and
you
think...
and
school
boards
would
qualify
as
representatives?
justice
white
and
they,
school
boards
are
sometimes,
they
are
mostly
elected
at
large,
aren't
they,
or
not?
justice
white
well,
i
guess
it's...
the
court
has
been
reasonably
clear
that
section
2(a)
applies
to
judges,
mr.
pugh?
justice
white
do
you
think
if
bolden
had
never
been
decided,
and
white
against
regester
was
still
hail
and
hearty,
do
you
think
that,
do
you
think
that
this
at-large
election
in
orleans
parish
could
have
been
attacked
under
the
standard
written
about
in
white
against
regester?
justice
white
sir?
justice
white
i
think
so,
too.
but...
and
don't
you
think--
justice
white
--don't
you
think
that
congress
intended
to
have
that
test
applied
as
a
statutory
matter
in
section
2?
justice
white
section
2(b).
justice
white
well,
you
still
have
to
get
over
the
notion,
you
have
to
convince
us
that
judges
aren't
covered
by
the
word
representative.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--six
of
those
judges
in
the
fifth
circuit
thought
that
they
were
covered.
justice
white
seven
didn't,
i
guess.
justice
white
all
those
six
didn't
read
the
dictionaries.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
dissent.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
of
course
a
state
can
elect
their
judges,
i
suppose,
and
empower
the
electorate
to
throw
the
judge
if
they
don't
like
the
way
he
decides
cases.
justice
white
well,
that's
exactly
what,
that's
exactly
what
happens
in
louisiana
and
texas,
isn't
it?
justice
white
if
the
electorate
doesn't
like
how
the
judge
operates
they
throw
him
out.
justice
white
well,
what
about
that
10
percent?
justice
white
and
you
don't
think
that
even
comes
close
to
suggesting
that
they
are
representative?
