mr.
robert
g.
pugh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
bring
something
in
focus
as
to
what
is
before
you
as
distinguished
from
what
isn't
before
you.
we
have
talked
in
the
last
few
minutes
about
constitutional
claims.
there
are
no
constitutional
claims
here
today.
those
were
posed
below
in
the
district
court
and
they
were
abandoned
in
the
district
court.
nothing
on
appeal.
there
is
no
nefarious
motion
or
idea
or
motive
before
you
today.
the
constitutional
claims
are
not
here.
what
is
here
is
that
41
states
elect
judges,
and
it's
about
41
states
that
ultimately
this
decision
must
consider.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
about
a
cajun
justice.
i
don't
know
him.
we
do
have
seven
justices.
of
the
seven
justices,
two
are
in
fact
elected
from
the
metropolitan
area
of
orleans.
they
have
been
so
elected
since
1879.
every
constitution
in
louisiana
since
1879
has
provided
for
this
same
electoral
arrangement.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes.
in
this
instance,
back
in
the
earlier
days,
the
1879
period,
that
was
the
focal
point
of
the
state,
in
orleans.
and
it
was
believed
by
the
people
who
convected
the
constitution
at
that
time
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
have
two
justices
from
that
specific
area,
that
metropolitan
area.
but
bringing
it
to
date,
if
i
may,
in
the
1974
constitutional,
the
73
constitutional
convention
which
resulted
in
the
election
by
the
people
of
a
new
constitution
in
1974,
every
time
the
issue
arose
concerning
whether
or
not
there
should
be
seven
districts
it
was
defeated.
it
was
defeated
with
the
black
votes
voting
primarily
against
such
a
concept.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
the--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--yes,
sir.
the
proposal--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--the
proposal
was
to
have
seven
districts,
as
distinguished
from
having
six
districts--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--and
then
a
combination
on
the
seventh.
now
in
that
connection
it
was
posed
at
the
convention
why
shouldn't
one-man
one-vote
be
applicable,
why
shouldn't
we
have
seven
districts,
why
shouldn't
we
provide
in
the
seven
districts
that
they
should
be
equal
in
population.
black
from
orleans
don't
want
that
system.
the
final
vote,
it
was
voted
with
one
black
voting
against
it,
and
that
person
was
from
the
east
baton
rough
parish.
but
more
up
to
date,
we
have
recently
had
that
same
issue
posed
to
the
people
across
the
board
of
louisiana.
should
we
in
effect
have
seven
justices
on
the
louisiana
supreme
court
each
elected
from
a
different
district?
what
happened
to
it
across
the
board?
orleans
voted
24
percent
in
favor
of
it,
bearing
in
mind
they
had
53
percent
of
the
population
at
that
time
were
black,
53.5
in
fact.
24
percent
voted
for
the
proposition,
76
voted
against
the
proposition,
percentage.
let's
look
at
it
in
the
four-parish
area.
in
the
four
parish
area
it
was
24
percent
against...
24
percent
for,
76
percent
against.
let's
look
across
the
state.
it
was
26
percent
for
and
74
percent
against.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
i
was
trying
to
illustrate
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
that,
as
suggested
by
the
chief,
why
the
districts,
and
trying
to
explain
that
that's
what
the
people
want.
i
will,
however,
considering
my
time,
like
to
move
on
to
the
rest
of
the
argument.
obviously
we
have
a
plain
meaning
question
here.
now,
representatives
was
used,
as
we
all
know,
as
being
a
suggestion
of
a
word
rather
than
legislators.
no
question
about
it.
senator
dole,
who
drew
the
so-called
compromise
amendment,
said
if
we
want
to
use
the
results
test
from
white,
let's
use
the
language
from
white.
and
that's
what
occurred.
they
didn't
use
the
word
"candidate",
which
would
have
embraced
the
judiciary.
they
didn't
talk
about
public
officials,
which
would
have
embraced
the
judiciary.
instead
they
used
one
word,
representatives.
obviously
candidate
would
have
been
more
than
representative.
candidate
appears
four
times
within
the
statute
itself,
and
for
reasons
only
they
know
they
chose
not
to
use
that
word.
now
i'd
like
to
move,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
of...
well,
obviously
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
if
anybody
knows
what
a
representative
is,
surely
congress
would
know
what
a
representative
was.
now,
for
18
years
preceding
this
act
or
the
amendment
to
this
act
there
were
15
cases,
admittedly
in
the
one-man
one-vote
area
of
the
law,
holding
that
judges
were
not
representatives.
not
one
of
those
cases
has
indicated,
that
i
could
see,
in
any
of
the
reports,
any
of
the
suggestions,
any
of
the
arguments,
why
would
congress,
a
body
who
somebody
quoted
as
being
of
lawyers,
why
would
congress
ignore
the
entire
one-third
structure
of
all
50
states,
except
for
the
reason
that
it
did
not
want
to
include
judges
as
being
representatives?
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
sir,
that
is
my
position.
and
i'll
tell
you
the
reason
that's
my
position.
first
of
all,
we
must
talk
about,
even
though
this
court
in
gingles
did
suggest,
in
fact
it
said
that
the
results
test
actually
took
the
place
of
the
intent
standard.
it
said
it
better
than
i
am
saying
it,
but
in
effect
it
said
intent
is
out
the
window,
result
comes
in.
now,
it
was
mentioned
a
minute
ago
about
referendums.
that's
not
the
only
thing.
you've
got
annexations,
deannexations,
you've
got
polling
places,
you've
got
a
litany
of
issue
that
must
fall
somewhere.
obviously,
i
believe
everybody
would
concede
that
issues
are
not
representatives.
they
must
fall
somewhere.
they
obviously
have
got
to
fall,
then,
under
2(a).
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
requires
intent.
and
i
say
the
intent
standard
is
still
there.
i
believe
the
intent
standard
is
applicable
to
the
judiciary.
now,
if
one
wants
to
read
it
out
of
2(a),
it's
still
in
the
fifteenth.
you
can
plead
either
or
both.
and
incidentally,
despite
the
fact
that
this
court
had
indicated
that
intent
was
out
of
the
window,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
authoritative,
everybody
agrees
what
the
senate
report
said
is
authoritative,
in
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six
places
in
the
senate
report
it
said
you
could
use
the
intent
standard
or
you
could
use
the
results
standard
under
section
2.
so
there
is
no
doubt,
at
least
i
believe,
intent
can
still
be
used
under
section
2.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that's
our
answer,
as
provided
in
subsection
(b),
which
carries--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
then
issues
are
out.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
not
at
all.
issues
are
out
then.
now,
what
difference
then
the
final
analysis
make
if
judges
are
not
under
the
intent
standard,
as
i
contend
under
2(a)?
suppose
they
are
not
there,
what
difference
does
it
make?
you
can
certainly
still
cover
them
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
so
the
result
is
still
the
same.
you
end
up
with
an
intent
standard.
a
state
can't
say
that
we're
going
to,
i
believe
in
the
words
of
one
of
you
in
one
of
the
cases,
that
we
can't
make
one
out
of
every
10.
it
was
justice
white.
you
can't
create
a
system
of
one
out
of
every
10
or
try
to
classify
some
way.
you
still
have
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
contend
with.
and
that's
what
i
say.
if
it's
not
under
2(a),
it
can't...
in
my
opinion
at
least
it
can't
be
under
2(b).
no
way
under
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
do
i
believe
that
a
representative
can
include
the
judiciary.
if
i
am
correct
on
that,
and
i
believe
i
am,
then
the
issue
becomes
are
they
out
completely?
congress
says
they're
not
out.
congress
says
you
can
use
an
intent
standard.
now
where
they're
going
to
get
it
from,
i
don't
know.
but
that's
what
this
says.
again,
i
reiterate--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
why
they
switched
from
legislators
to
representatives,
i
don't
know
and
i
doubt
seriously
if
anybody
knows
except
perhaps
them.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i
think
it
includes
the
executives.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
would
be
someone...
well,
i
think
it's
in
there
for
two
reasons.
one,
an
executive
can
be
a
school
board
member.
and
i
think
there's
a
great
deal
of
concern
about
school
boards
and
their
operations
insofar
as
congress
is
concerned.
and
i
think
what
they
were
trying
to
do
is
not
get
in
the
trap
of
saying
legislators
and
somebody
throwing
on
an
executive
hat
and
saying
it
ain't
me.
what
they
wanted
to
do
with
the
school
boards
is
fully
cover
them,
whether
they
were
executives
or
legislators.
i
can't
tell
you
that
that's
anywhere
in
it,
because
it's
not.
all
i
believe
is
that
representatives
is
broader
than
legislators.
i
believe
it's
much
narrower,
meanwhile,
than
is
the
word
candidate,
which
they
could
have
used.
now
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
the
touch
tone,
that's
telephones,
the
actual
method
by
which
you
make
the
determination
under
gingles
starts
off,
first
threshold
is
nothing
more
than,
or
less
than
a
one-man
one-vote
standard.
it's
got
to
be.
you've
got
to
create
a
district.
to
create
a
district
that's
compact
you've
got
to
measure
some
undiluted
district.
so
you
can't
get
to
the
first
test
unless
you
get
by
one-man
one-vote.
you
can't
get
by
one-man
one-vote
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
do
something
about
wells,
which
incidentally
was
a
louisiana
supreme
court
case.
that
was
the
case
where
an
intent
was
made
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i
know
of
no
other
reason
there
could
possibly
be
than
that.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
excuse
me,
school
board.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
that's
really
what--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--well,
that's
one
of
them.
that's
one
that
comes
to
mind.
obviously
if
you
have
just
an
individual
that
falls
in
the
executive
classification,
a
parish
commission
would
be
another
one.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
sir,
i
would,
because
i
think
they
have
that
dual
function.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
they
are
primarily
elected
at
large.
but
they
certainly
have
more
than
an
executive
function.
they
certainly
have
more
than
a
legislative
function.
they
wear
both
hats,
as
does,
as
i
indicated,
a
parish
commission.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
section--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--i
believe
it
applies
to
judges.
the
senate
indicates
that
you
can
still
use
an
intent
standard.
i
don't
know
of
anywhere
else
to
put
it
than
2(a),
because
you
sure
can't
put
it
in
2(b).
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
trickles
down
to
2(b).
2(b)
is
where
the
test
appears.
the
test
to
be
applied
is
in
2(b).
that's
admitted
by
the
justice
department,
at
least
in
the
brief
that
they
filed
in
the
clark
case,
which
you
are
about
to
hear
around
1
o'clock.
they
have
admitted
that
the
results
test
is
2(b).
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
i
put
no
more
freight
on
it
than
what
congress
apparently
did,
because
that's
all
they
said.
they
said,
of
course,
as
provided
in
subsection
(b)
of
this
section,
which
is
the
last
provision
in
2(a),
and
was
not
a
provision...
of
course,
it
came
up
from
the
house.
the
house's
provision
was
entirely
different
than
what
we
currently
have
with
section
2(a)
and
2(b).
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that's
a
conjunction,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i'm
not
being
playful,
or
i
shouldn't
be
in
any
event.
i
just
say
that
is
a
conjunction.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
not
when
the
conjunction
is
there,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
they
are
not
representatives.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
let's
put
it
under
the
intent
standard
then
rather
than
the
results
standard,
because
the
results
standard
says
specifically
that
it's
related
to
representatives
of
their
choice.
it
doesn't
say
judges
of
their
choice.
it
doesn't
say
issues
of
their
choice.
it
says
representatives
of
their
choice.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
to
vote.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that's
to
vote.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
to
vote
and
elect
representatives
of
your
choice.
i
still
think
with
the
conjunction
that
it's
talking
about
both
things.
it's
talking
about
voting
for
and
elect
representatives
of
your
choice.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
do
they
represent
anybody?
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
not
in
the
sense
that
the
word
representation
is
used
here.
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
i
can
only
suggest--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--he
may
well
feel
that
he--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--he
is
elected
by
those
people
to
serve
on
the
court
on
their
behalf.
if
that--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--well,
i
can
only
say--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--i
apologize.
i
bet
i
got
a
dozen
votes
there
that
says
for
goodness
sake,
if
you
don't
do
anything
else,
use
the
word
person
instead
of...
and
i'm
sorry.
i
can't
read
very
well,
but
they're
over
there.
i
got
that
message
put
to
me.
unfortunately
it
didn't
stay
with
me.
[laughter]
i'd
like
to
address
another
issue,
if
i
may,
and
that's
the
issue
of
not
only
are
we
dealing
with
plain
meaning,
one
of
the
definitions
of
representatives
of
course
being
an
agent.
and
obviously
an
executive
and
a
legislator
are
the
agent
of
the
electorate
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
their
wishes.
sometimes
they
don't
always
do
it,
but
they
are
supposed
to
do
it
in
any
event.
if
they
don't
do
it
they're
not
going
to
get
reelected.
now,
another
important
factor,
i
think,
that
plays
on
this
case
is
the
question
of
this
tremendous
movement,
41
states
that
elect
judges
and
not
one
word
said
about
judges
in
all
of
this
with
the
single
exception
of
what
was
used
as
judicial
districts,
and
we
believe
we
have
resolved
that
at
least
by
reflecting
that
more
than
judges,
other
than
judges
get
elected
from
judicial
districts.
it
is
true
that
in
some
of
the
preparation
of
the
materials
that
were
submitted
to
congress
had
the
success
of
blacks
in
judicial
races
and
that
thing,
but
there's
no
mention
when
it
comes
to
the
concrete
evidence
of
senate
reports
about
that.
if
there
was
to
be
a
total
change
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
country
to
provide
that
the
third
branch
of
government
was
to
be
thrust
into
this
voting
rights
quagmire,
it's
pretty
obvious
that
somebody
would
have
said
something.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
sir,
they
were,
because
it
was
intent.
and
again
i
think
that
the
intent
standard
of
the
original
section
2
covered
judges.
but--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
i
think
it's
a
dramatic
change
in
that
they
are
definitively
covered
for
the
purpose
of
this
brand
new
results
test.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
representatives
are,
your
honor.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
that's
what
congress
said.
my
suggestion
is
that
if
they
intended
judges
to
be
covered,
there
is
other
language
that
could
and
should
have
been
used,
candidate
being
one
of
them.
but
obviously
when
you,
when
this
court
has
said
that...
when
this
court
has
said,
as
it
did
in
the
gingles
case,
that
insofar
as
intent
is
concerned
that
is
the
test
of
section
2.
well,
it
would
be
silly
if
i
were
to
argue,
when
this
court
says
that
what
section,
the
original
section
2
meant
was
an
intent
test,
when
i
know
there's
an
intent
test
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
try
to
stand
here
and
argue
that
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
intent
tests,
one
statutorily
which
creates
a
different
set
of
categories
and
one
constitutional,
constitutionally,
facts
that
would
create
another
standard.
so
certainly
i'll
have
to
acknowledge
that
intent
was
under
the
original
section
2.
and
for
that
reason.
the
one-person
one-vote
is
where
the
dramatic
change
will
occur.
you
cannot
follow
the
thornburg
v.
gingles
case
unless
you
apply
a
one-person
one-vote
standard.
you
can't
get
there
without
it.
and
right
now
judges
have
been
held,
by
this
court
twice
and
by
13
other
courts,
as
not
being
under
the
one-man
one-vote...
and
for
a
good
reason.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
apparently
i
should
have
said
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
if
i
may
be
candid
enough
to
repeat
my--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--2
or
2(b),
your
honor?
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
think
they
would
have
said
so
if
they
intended
to.
i
think
it
still
gets
back
to
we've
got
the
plain
meaning
problem,
we've
got
the
changes
of
now
shoving
judges
over
into
one-person
one-vote.
i
just...
large
and
small
of
it,
you're
still
back
to
the
word
representatives
and
what
does
it
mean.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
i
could
drag
out
some
dictionaries.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i
don't
find
it...
i
do
find
cases
holding
that
they
are
not
representatives.
i
find
15
cases
that
hold
they
are
not
representatives.
i
find
two
cases
in
this
court
that
indicate
that.
so
if
they
are,
they
brand
new
are,
and
they
are
today.
they
ain't
been
in
the
past,
your
honor.
it
appears
to
me
they
haven't
been
in
the
past.
i
just
don't
believe,
as
judge
king
said
when
i
made
the
same
statement
in
the
fifth
circuit,
i
just
don't
believe
that
you
can
live
with
the
judiciary
not
being
a
one-person
one-vote
standard
and
at
the
same
time
tie
into
thornhill
v.
gingles.
she
said
it's
not
an...
this
is
an
imperfect
world.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that's
right,
your
honor.
i'd
call
that
close.
fortunately
i
had
the
seven,
your
honor.
[laughter]
it's
awful
close,
and
i
can
understand...
i
believe--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--well,
not
very
well.
[laughter]
i'm
not
really
sure
it
was
six,
but
i
won't
quarrel
with
the
number.
i
think
it
was
closer
than
that.
as
the
court
well
knows,
one
of
the
judges
who
heard
the
en
banc
had
put
in
his
papers
and
they
had
been
accepted,
and
he
didn't
vote.
the
remain...
i
think
it's
one
in
three
voted
with
higginbotham.
that
would
have
been
politz,
that
would
have
been
king,
and
that
would
have
been
davis.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
and
then
of
course
we
had
the--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--the
chief,
who
concurred.
and
incidentally,
as
kind
of
a
little
bit
where
i
got
some
of
these
issue
ideas
from,
is
i
read
his
concurrent
opinion.
of
course
he,
he
emphatically
said
in
his
opinion
that
there
is
no
way,
or
at
least
in
his
belief
there
is
no
way
that
you
could
consider
judges
as
representatives.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i
think
it's
the
blindfolded
lady
with
a
sword
and
with
a
scale.
that's
the
constituency
of
the
judiciary.
no
more,
no
less.
i
just
don't
believe
a
judge
can
put
on
partial
robes,
and
i
think
we've
got
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
role
of
a
judge
is
much
different
than
the
role
occupied
or
function
occupied
by
either
a
legislator
or
a--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--and
that's
exactly
what
is
going
to
happen,
your
honor,
if--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--i
don't
believe--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--well,
that's
what
the
law
provides,
but
i
guarantee
you
one
thing,
not
too
many
of
them
shed
the
robes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
almost
90
percent
reelection
rate--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--well,
they
may
have
been
doing
what
i
would
hope
would
never
occur,
that
is
to
show
favoritism
to
a
certain
group
or
to
show
stupidity
in
the
decisions
when
they
render
them.
of
course
there
is
a
means
for
getting
rid
of
them,
and
that
means
is
the
ballot
box
next
time
they
go
around.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
think
they
are
people
who
must
face
the
public
on
a
periodic
basis,
because
louisiana,
unlike
new
jersey
and
some
other
states
where
the
judges
are
appointed
for
life,
we
don't
have
that.
we
have
them--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--yes,
i
have,
and
i
apologize,
your
honor.
excuse
me,
sir.
