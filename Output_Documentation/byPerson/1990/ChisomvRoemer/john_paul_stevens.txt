mr.
pugh,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
stevens
in
white
against
regester
the
court's
opinion
used
the
term
legislators--
justice
stevens
--and
then
congress
substituted
the
word
representatives.
is
the
word
representatives
in
your
view
somewhat
broader
than
the
term
legislators?
justice
stevens
what
is--
justice
stevens
--what
does
it
include
in
addition
to
legislators
in
your--
justice
stevens
--includes
all
the
executives.
any
elected
executive
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
two
cases
i
have
to
announce
are
chisom
against
roemer
and
the
league
of
united
latin-american
citizens
council
against
clemens.
both
of
the
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
they
both
present
the
same
basic
question
concerning
the
coverage
of
section
two
of
the
voting
rights
act
as
amended
in
1982.
one
of
them
is
a
challenge
to
the
method
of
electing
the
two
members
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
who
represent
the
four
parishes
that
comprise
the
new
orleans
metropolitan
area.
the
other
is
a
challenge
to
the
method
of
electing
trial
judges
in
10
counties
in
texas.
in
both
cases
in
this
court,
the
petitioners
rely
exclusively
on
section
two
of
the
voting
rights
act.
and
in
both
cases,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
their
claims
are
outside
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
the
basic
question
presented
then
is
whether
the
so-called
results
test
that
was
added
to
the
voting
rights
act
in
1982
is
applicable
to
a
claim
alleging
that
an
at
large
method
of
electing
judges
violates
the
statute,
or
stating
the
question
somewhat
differently
whether
section
2
is
amended
has
the
same
application
to
judicial
elections
that
it
has
to
the
election
of
other
public
officials.
the
word
of
history
will
help
explain
the
issue.
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
broadly
provides
that
the
right
of
citizens
to
vote
shall
not
be
denied
or
abridged
by
any
state
on
account
of
race,
color,
or
previous
condition
of
servitude.
section
two
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
was
essentially
a
statutory
qualification
of
that
provision.
it
unquestionably
applied
to
all
state
elections,
including
the
elections
of
legislators,
executive
officials,
and
judges.
in
1980,
in
the
case
of
city
of
mobil
against
boldon,
a
plurality
of
this
court
concluded
that
neither
the
15th
amendment
nor
section
two
was
violated
unless
the
plaintiff
could
prove
intentional
discrimination.
that
decision
prompted
congress
to
amend
the
statute
in
1982
to
eliminate
the
requirement
of
proof
of
intentional
discrimination
and
to
substitute
a
so-called
results
test
under
which
a
violation
can
be
proved
by
evidence
that
an
election
practice
has
resulted
in
the
denial
or
abridgment
of
the
right
to
vote
based
on
color
or
race.
because
language
in
the
amendment
describing
the
results
test
refers
to
the
need
to
prove
that
members
of
the
protected
class
have
less
opportunity
than
other
members
of
the
electorate
to
participate
in
the
political
process
and
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice.
the
majority
of
the
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
focusing
their
attention
on
the
use
of
the
word,
representatives,
included
that
congress
did
not
intend
a
new
test
to
be
applicable
to
judicial
elections
or
at
least
to
every
discriminatory
practice
used
in
judicial
elections.
we
disagree
with
this
reading
of
the
statute.
we
conclude
that
the
coverage
provided
by
the
1982
amendment
is
co-extensive
with
the
coverage
provided
by
the
act
prior
to
1982
and
the
judicial
elections
are
embraced
within
that
coverage.
the
amendment
was
unquestionably
intended
to
expand
the
protection
of
the
statute
and
our
examination
of
the
extensive
legislative
history
of
the
amendment
discloses
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
any
category
of
elections
whether
of
judges,
executive
officials,
or
legislatures
from
the
protection
afforded
by
that
amendment.
we
believe
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
exclude
any
category
of
claims
involving
judicial
elections
from
coverage
under
the
amended
act
that
it
would
have
said
so
explicitly.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
both
cases
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia

filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which

chief
justice

and

has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
statement
in
one
of
the
cases.
