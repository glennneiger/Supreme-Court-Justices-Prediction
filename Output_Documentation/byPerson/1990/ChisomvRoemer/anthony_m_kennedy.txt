but
if
the
judges
are
representatives
in
the
way
that
you
have
described,
then
ought
we
to
rethink
that
line
of
authority
and
indicate
that
one-person
one-vote
does
apply
to
all
representatives?
it
seems
to
me
that,
to
the
extent
you
say
judges
are
representatives,
that
it
may
undercut
the
rationale
of
the
line
of
authority
which
suggests
that
one-person
one-vote
is
inapplicable.
justice
kennedy
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
that
you
advocate
as
the
correct
standard
under
the
section
that
is
here
involved.
justice
kennedy
do
you
think
it
should
be
applied
to
the
election
of
judges?
justice
kennedy
how
is
that
different
from
proportional
representation?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
is
the
object
of
your
cumulative
voting
exercise?
justice
kennedy
and
how
do
you
measure
that
say?
do
you
measure
it
by
their
success
in
electing
candidates?
justice
kennedy
well,
candidates
of
their
choice.
isn't
that
proportional
representation?
justice
kennedy
you
define
proportional
representation
as
just
being
a
racial
calculus?
justice
kennedy
no,
i
think
the
suggestion
here
is
that
members
of
the
black
community
want
to
be
able
to
identify
a
candidate
as
is
theirs.
i
though
that
was
the
gravamen
of
your
cumulative
voting
argument.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
if
you
have
an
identifiable
candidate,
regardless
of
the
race
of
that
candidate,
representing
a
racial
group,
i
think
that's
proportional
representation,
or
otherwise
it's
just
a
quibble.
justice
kennedy
and
you're
telling
me
that
it's
irrelevant
the
race
of
the
members
who
serve
on
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
in
this
case?
