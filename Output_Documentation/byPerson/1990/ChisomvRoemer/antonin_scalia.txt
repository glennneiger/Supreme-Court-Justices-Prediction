justice
scalia
less
than
what,
general
starr?
you
said
there
can
be
less
than
other
peoples
have...
than
other
people
have.
you
say
that
people
in
one
county
can
have
much
greater
opportunity
to
elect
a
judge
than
people
in
another
county.
less
than
what?
it
seems
to
me
you
need
a
standard
for
dilution.
you
don't
know
what
watered
beer
is
unless
you
know
what
beer
is,
right?
justice
scalia
you
need
a
standard
of
watering.
what
is
the
standard
for
watering
the
election
of
judges?
justice
scalia
but
you
have
said
it's
okay
to
have
less
of
a
chance
than
others
in
other
counties,
right?
justice
scalia
could
you
give
me,
you
know,
just
what
the
baseline
is?
in
those
elections
that
are
governed
by
one-person
one-vote
we
know
what
the
baseline
is.
justice
scalia
people
are
supposed
to
have,
no
matter
what
their
race,
the
same
say.
now
you
say
that
is
not
the
standard
here.
what
is
the...
how
do
i
know,
then,
when
a
person
of
a
certain
race
has
gotten
less
than
what
he
is
entitled
to?
justice
scalia
did
they
also
involve
candidates
who
were
subject
to
the
one-person
one-vote
requirement?
justice
scalia
did
they
involve
offices
that
were
not
subject
to
the
one-person
one-vote
requirement?
justice
scalia
well,
don't
make
me
go
back
and
read
all
those
cases.
just
tell
me
the
test.
[laughter]
what
is
the
standard?
you
know,
what
is
the
baseline?
justice
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
i
don't
understand.
that
means
it
depends,
right?
justice
scalia
i
do
not
think
that's
a
baseline.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
but
that
assumes
that
the
state
is
taking
nothing
into
account
except
numbers,
and
it
presumably
is
also
taking
into
account
geography,
the
nature
of
the
political
units
into
which
these
districts
are
drawn.
you're
imposing
upon
the
state
a
numerical
criterion
as
the
sole
criterion.
justice
scalia
it's
the
sole
one
you're
willing
to
judge
them
on.
you're
saying
they
use
400
to
800,000
for
the
other
justices,
why
can't
they
use
it
for
this
one.
justice
scalia
and
their
answer
might
be
well,
we
have
different
geographic
regions
and
there
are
different--
justice
scalia
--that
may
well
be,
but
you
can
make
that
argument
about
any
political
arrangement
that
they
make.
that
there
may
be
a
nefarious
motive,
but--
justice
scalia
mr.
pugh--
justice
scalia
--is
it
your
position
that
judges
are
not
covered
by
2(b),
but
are
covered
by
2(a)?
justice
scalia
because
it
makes
sense,
you
say?
i
mean,
i
agree
it
makes
sense,
but
how
do
you
get
there
from
the
language?
i
mean,
it
says...
what
is
says
is
that
no
voting
qualification
shall
be
imposed
in
a
manner
which
results
in
a
denial
or
abridgement
as
provided
in
subsection
(b).
justice
scalia
but
subsection
(b)
provides
that
it
doesn't
cover
anything
except
representatives.
justice
scalia
so
that
leaves
subsection
(a)
covering
nothing
except
representatives.
justice
scalia
you
suddenly
jump
off
there,
right?
justice
scalia
mr.
pugh,
what
about...
what
2(b)
says
is
that
its
members
have
less
opportunity
than
other
members
of
the
electorate
not
just
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice,
but
to
participate
in
the
political
process
and
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice.
justice
scalia
it
is
indeed.
might
judges--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
right.
might
judges
be
covered
by
the
first
and
not
by
the
second?
justice
scalia
well,
they're
entitled
to
both.
justice
scalia
they
are
entitled
to
both.
if
they
are
denied
either
one
there
is
a
violation.
justice
scalia
what
does
participate
in
the
political
process
in
2(b)
mean,
do
you
think?
justice
scalia
it's
clear
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice
does
get
you
into
the
dilution
issue.
justice
scalia
what
about
participating
in
the
political
process?
does
that--
justice
scalia
--to
vote?
