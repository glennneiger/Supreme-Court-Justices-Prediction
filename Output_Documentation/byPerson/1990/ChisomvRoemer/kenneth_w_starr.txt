mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
brings
before
the
court
an
important
issue
of
the
coverage
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
specific
question
is
whether
the
results
test
of
section
2
of
that
act
applies
to
the
election
of
judges.
in
its
en
banc
opinion
in
the
lulac
case,
which
will
be
argued
next,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
judges
are
not
covered
by
the
results
test.
the
court's
reasoning
was
that
section
2(b)
of
that
statute,
added
in
1982,
by
its
terms
applies
to
the
election
of
representatives,
and
in
the
court's
view,
the
elected
judges
are
not
representatives.
as
a
result
of
the
opinion
in
lulac,
the
fifth
circuit
panel
in
this
case,
which
involves
a
challenge
to
the
at-large
election
of
two
justices
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
ordered
this
lawsuit
dismissed.
in
our
view
the
fifth
circuit,
with
all
respect,
is
wrong.
it
is
wrong
in
light
of
the
text
of
the
voting
rights
act,
including
its
comprehensive
definition
of
vote
and
voting
set
forth
in
section
14(c)(1),
in
light
of
the
structure
of
the
statute,
including
section
5,
the
preclearance
provision,
which
all
admit
covers
the
election
of
judges,
and
in
light
of
the
elaborate
history
of
the
voting
rights
act
at
the
time
of
its
original
passage
and
the
1982
amendments.
the
fifth
circuit
also,
we
believe,
erred
on
what
it
viewed
as
a
basic
point.
that
is
not
only
are
judges
covered
by
the
terms
of
the
statute,
when
they
are
elected
they
are
candidates
for
public
office,
and
that
is
what
the
voting
rights
act
covers.
but
it
is
also
wrong
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
term
"representatives".
we
think
that
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
congress
provided
no
definition
of
the
term
"representatives".
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
was
using
this
as
a
term
of
art.
and
judges
who
are
elected
are
quite
literally
representatives
within
the
dictionary
meaning
of
that
term.
and,
as
judge
higginbotham
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
lulac,
judges
who
have
been
chosen
by
the
people
and
are
directly
accountable
to
the
people
are
in
a
very
real
and
practical
sense
representatives.
and
we
see
that
in
the
louisiana
system.
that
is
the
candidates
for
a
seat
on
the
louisiana
supreme
court
are
involved
fully
in
the
political
process
in
the
very
basic
sense
of
getting
themselves
elected
to
public
office.
and
that's
what
the
voting
rights
act
is
all
about.
it's
about
voting,
and
it's
about
elections.
and
whatever,
the
very
important,
the
lofty
function,
the
solemn
responsibility
of
that
justice,
once
the
justice
is
in
office,
the
plain
fact
remains
that
to
get
into
office
in
louisiana
the
justice
had
to
get
himself
elected.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
line
of
authority,
and
it
is
clear
that
judges
are
not
covered
by
the
one-person
one-vote
principle,
is
inapplicable
here.
and
i
think
the
court
can
see
that
both
in
terms
of
the
function
of
that
body
of
law
and
what
that
body
of
law
was
designed
to
get
at,
and
it
can
see
it
most
clearly
in
this
court's
decision
in
white
against
regester.
because
there,
in
analyzing
the
texas
districting
scheme,
the
court
rejected
a
one-person
one-vote
challenge,
but
at
the
same
time
credited
and
upheld
an
attack
to
the
minority
dilution
effect
in
the
two
counties...
in
dallas
county
and
bayer
county.
the
two
are
entirely
distinct
lines
of
authority
seeking
to
get
at
different
themes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
respectfully
disagree,
and
we
certainly
are
not
urging
that.
and
i
disagree
for
this
reason.
think
of
a
large
state
with
perhaps
quite
small
predominantly
rural
counties.
the
law
is,
and
i
think
the
law
is
sound
in
this
respect,
that
a
state
as
a
matter
of
policy
can
make
a
determination
that
each
county
should
have
a
judge,
even
if
the
numbers
don't
justify
that.
so
too,
it
may
very
well
be
that
even
though
the
numbers
may
not
justify
in
terms
of
population
the
large
number
of
judges
in
an
urban
district
as
opposed
to
a
suburban
district
that
perhaps
is
less
litigious,
nonetheless
states
can
determine
to
order
their
on
structures
in
ways
that
are
responsive
to
the
needs
of
the
people.
that
strikes
us
as
very
sensible,
and
this
court
itself
in
white
against
regester
said
those
same
kinds
of
state
interests
and
state
policies
permit
greater
deviations
in
state
legislative
redistricting
than
is
the
case
in
congressional
districting,
which
requires
almost
mathematical
exactitude.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
test
in
a
vote
dilution
claim
is
whether
there
is
in
fact,
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
as
set
forth
in
section
2(b),
less
of
an
opportunity
for
minority
persons
to
participate
fully
in
the
political
process
and
to
elect
candidates
of
their
choice.
it
is
what
congress
did
in--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--less--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
standard
is
less
than
others,
less
than
nonminority
persons.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
in
terms
of
equal
protection
principles
as
embodied
in
one-person
one-vote.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
justice
scalia,
is
the
line
of
authority
with
respect
to
vote
dilution
is
exactly
different,
it
is
distinct.
we
are
talking
about
a
statute
passed
by
congress.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
constitutional
standard
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
would
commend
to
the
court
the
vast
body
of
law
that
the
senate
report
in
1982
looked
to.
it
said
we
have
seen
the
test
fashioned
by
this
court
in
white
v.
regester
faithfully
applied
in
no
fewer
than
23
cases.
and
those
cases
all
involve
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
which,
as
this
court
put
it
in
white
v.
regester,
is
an
intensely
local
appraisal
to
determine
whether
minorities
enjoy
full
access.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
some
did,
and
some
rejected
one-person
one-vote
challenges
while
at
the
same
time
vindicating
a
vote
dilution
challenge
brought
by
minorities.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
any
of
those
did,
but
some
may.
i
am
not
going
to
say
authoritatively
that
none
did.
a
vast
array
of
offices
were
involved;
some
of
them
were
intensely
local.
i
do
believe,
my
best
recollection
is
one-person
one-vote
did
apply.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
baseline
is
set
forth
in
the
statute,
and
that
baseline
is
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
the
congressionally
mandated
baseline.
it
is
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
dilution
of
the
effectiveness
and
the
ability
of
minorities
to
participate
fully
in
the
electoral
process
and
to
elect
candidates
of
their
choice.
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
white
against
regester.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
what
happened?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
the
bolden
case
it
eventually
went
back,
after
this
court's
decision
in
bolden,
and
the
challenge
was
rejected.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
they
broke
up
the
districts.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
were
at-large
districts
and
they
broke
them
up.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
perhaps
it
did
not.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
the
point
is
congress
said
this
is
the
standard
in
section
2--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
could
be...
i
think
it
could
be
both.
i
think
it
could
be
both
fourteenth
and
fifteenth.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
bolden
said
exactly
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--correct.
correct.
it
can
go
farther.
now,
congress,
as
least
as
embodied
in
the
senate
report
which
this
court
has
described
as
authoritative,
believed
that,
with
all
respect,
the
court
in
city
of
mobile
erred.
but
notwithstanding
that,
it
respected
that
judgment
because
this
court
is
the
final
authoritative
voice
on
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
put
what
it
did
say
is
we
have
power
to
in
fact
embody
that
test,
which
not
only
is
correct
and
right
in
our
view,
but
also
has
shown
to
be
workable.
it
works.
it
does
not
in
fact
create
an
untriable,
amorphous
standard.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
does
what
incorporate?
section
2?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
thornburg
against
gingles
sets
forth
this
court's
reading
of
what
the
senate
report
factors
pointed
to.
we
are
not
here
today
quarreling
with
thornburg
against
gingles,
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that
the
standards
set
forth
in
section
2,
and
as
interpreted
in,
by
this
court,
should
be
applied
to
the
election
of
judges.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
i
think
something
very
important
is
involved
in
the
election
of
judges,
and
this
is
the
state
interest
and
its
structure
of
the
judiciary.
in
this
case
there
is
no
powerful
state
interest
with
respect
to
at-large
elections.
that
is
to
say
the
louisiana
supreme
court
is
elected,
with
the
exception
of
the
first
judicial
district,
from
single-member
districts.
but
the
senate
report,
and
thornburg
against
gingles
noted
this,
did
look
to
the
fifth
circuit's
seminal
decision
in
zimmer
against
mckeithen,
and
there,
particularly
at
page
1305
of
that
opinion,
the
fifth
circuit
looked
to
the
state
interest
and
the
powerful,
compelling
nature
of
the
state
interest
in
that
particular
structure.
we
do
believe
that
that
is
a
consideration,
a
factor
to
be
weighed
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
as
we
have
sought
to
elaborate
in
our
amicus
brief
in
the
lulac
case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
may
not
apply
in
full
measure.
what
i
think
thornburg
against
gingles
was
seeking
to
do
was
to
take
the
1982
amendments
as
elaborated
by
what
the
gingles
court
viewed
as
authoritative,
the
senate
report,
and
to
analyze
that
report
and
then
to
say
how
is
a
case
made
out
in
the
legislative,
that
of
course
was
a
legislative
contest
or
a
legislative
districting
issue
and
not
a
judicial
structuring
issue.
and
we
do
think,
for
the
very
reasons
that
judge
higginbotham
set
forth
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
lulac,
that
different
kinds
of
considerations
are
at
play
and
should
be
considered.
and
thornburg
had
no
occasion
to
consider
those.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
issue
is
not
before
us,
but
i
think
it
does.
what
we
believe
is
that
the
statute
applies,
period,
to
any
election.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
believe
it
applies.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
it
is,
but
i
would
suggest
that,
very
briefly,
that
the
function
of
2(b)
is
to
tell
us
what
the
2(a)
standard
is
all
about.
2(a)
is
the
critical
prohibition
in
section
2,
and
section
2
is
the
heart
of
this
statute,
and
section
2
speaks
very
broadly,
no
voting
qualification,
no
prerequisite
to
voting,
no
standard
practice
or
procedure.
and
then
we
look
again
to
14(c)(1)
to
see
what
the
breadth
of
that
is,
and
it
is
universal.
in
fact
14(c)(1)
talks
about
votes
for
non-candidates.
we
believe
that
this
is
uniformly
universally
applicable
to
all
elections.
then
the
way
that
the
standard
is
to
be
applied
is
through
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis.
that
is
what
section
2(b)
tells
us.
but
the
function
of
2(b)
is
not
in
fact
to
identify
the
offices
that
are
covered.
and
when
congress
wants
to
do
that
it
full
knows
well
how
to
do
it,
as
illustrated
by
section
11
of
the
statute
which
has
an
enumeration
of
specific
offices
to
which
that
particular
provision
or
prohibition
applies.
i'd
like
to
reserve,
if
i
may,
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
very
briefly,
judges
were
clearly
covered
by
section
2
prior
to
1982.
there
is
no
indication--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
but
it
could
not
be
clearer
that
they
were.
this
is
in
fact
a
direct
meaning,
plain,
natural
meaning
case
when
we
look
at
the
definition.
when
congress
revisited
this
statute
in
1982
it
did
not
modify
the
definitional
provisions
of
14(c)(1).
to
judge
gee
and
his
colleagues
that
was
irrelevant
because
it
was
buried
deep
in
the
statute.
that's
where
we'd
look
to
where
the
statute
was
covered,
what
it
was
all
about.
when
we
then
look
to
the
use
of
representatives,
that
word
found
its
way
into
the
statute,
deep
into
the
untidy
legislative
process,
introduced
by
senator
dole
in
the
compromise
when
the
battle
was
not
over
coverage,
what
offices
are
going
to
be
covered.
that
issue
was
at
rest
in
1965
and
has
remained
at
rest.
what
was
at
issue
is
is
intent
required
by
this
statute
or
does
it
suffice
to
prove
results
and
effects.
not
a
word
in
the
legislative
history
about
dropping
judges
suddenly.
whoops,
they're
gone.
they
were
covered,
but
suddenly
they're
gone
by
virtue
of
the
dole
compromise.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
questions
about
the
state
supreme
court.
we
do
in
fact
believe
that
a
state
may
have
a
very
powerful,
indeed
compelling
interest
in
its
structure
of
government,
especially
at
a
state
supreme
court
level,
and
having
each
of
those
justices
responsible
to,
if
it
chooses
to
elect
them,
and
accountable
to
the
entirety
of
the
electorate.
and
in
our
reading
of
the
senate
report,
in
our
reading
of
zimmer
against
mckeithen,
that
interest
can
in
fact
and
should
be
taken
into
account
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
perhaps
not,
because
we
would
have
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
perhaps
yes.
because
under,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
i
think
congress
contemplated
exactly
that.
it
looked
to
what
happened
in
white
against
regester,
and
it
approved
of
what
it
saw
there.
