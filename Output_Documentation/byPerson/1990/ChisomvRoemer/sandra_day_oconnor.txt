justice
o'connor
general
starr,
there
is
some
authority
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
one-vote
one-person
requirement
in
election
for
judges.
how
do
you
think
a
vote
dilution
claim
is
made
out
in
the
absence
of
that,
if
applied
to
judges?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
test
then
in
a
vote
dilution
claim
if
it
applies
to
judges?
justice
o'connor
but
gingles--
--no,
i
asked
about
thornburg
and
gingles.
should
that
rationale
be
applied
across
the
board
in
interpreting
whether
or
not
a
judge,
or
petitioner
is
contesting
the
allocation
of
judgeships
have
made
out
a
violation
under
section
2?
do
you
use
thornburg
and
gingles?
justice
o'connor
it
just,
it
isn't
clear
to
me
how
you
think
gingles
would
apply
in
the
absence
of
a
one-person
one-vote
requirement.
that
was
the
underpinning
of
the
majority
holding
in
that
case.
justice
o'connor
general
starr,
do
you
think
that
the
section
2(b)
requirements
extend
to
merit
selection
retention
elections
as
well?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
about
an
election
on
referendum
measures--
justice
o'connor
--despite
the
use
of
the
word
representatives?
justice
o'connor
it's
a
little
hard
to
argue
that
a
referendum
is
a
representative.
justice
o'connor
so
would
you...
you
would
take
the
position
that
in
a
state
that
for
instance
had
five
supreme
court
justices,
and
they
were
all
elected
statewide,
that
a
2(b)
claim
could
be
made
out
and
the
state
could
be
forced
to
set
up
a
separate
district
for
the
election?
justice
o'connor
2(a).
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course
2(a)
itself
was
amended,
as
justice
scalia
noted
in
his
question
to
you,
to
include
the
word
results
and
to
refer
specifically
to
2(b).
justice
o'connor
well,
if
2(a)
applies
and
it
refers
in
2(a)
to
the
word
results,
and
it
incorporates
whatever
the
standard
is
in
2(b),
you
have
to
put
a
tremendous
amount
of
freight
on
the
word
representatives
to
say
somehow
you
can't
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
when
it
comes
to
judicial
election.
