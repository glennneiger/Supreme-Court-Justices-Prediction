justice
souter
--but
if
we
had
that
kind
of
a
scheme
we
would
at
least,
or
the
court
that
has
to,
that
had
to
draw
the
district
or
find
the
violation
would
at
least
have
on
the
numerical
issue
a
principled
basis
for
saying
yes,
there
can
be
a
district
of
appropriate
size.
if
we
don't
have
some
kind
of
one-person
one-vote
scheme,
what
is
the
principled
basis
upon
which
we
can
weight
that
particular
factor?
justice
souter
well,
what
if
the
state
is
not
quite
to
cooperative,
and
what
if
the
figures
aren't
quite
that
neat?
is
10
to
1
okay?
one
district
has
a
ratio
of
let's
say
900
to
1
judge,
and
the
other
would
have
a
ratio
of
100
to
1
judge?
where
do
we
draw
those
lines?
