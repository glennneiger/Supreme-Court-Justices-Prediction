ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
turn
first
to
the
question
of
baselines
that
has
been
raised
by
justices
o'connor,
kennedy,
and
scalia,
and
give
you
three
ways
in
which
that
baseline
question
can
be
answered
in
judicial
elections
even
assuming
that
one-person
one-vote
doesn't
apply.
the
first
one
is
concrete
from
this
case.
we
know
already
that
the
state
of
louisiana
is
willing
to
have
single
member
districts
ranging
in
size
from
410,000
to
over
800,000
justices.
that
is
part
of
the
stipulation
with
regard
to
the
existing
single-member
districts.
therefore,
if
plaintiffs
can
show
that
using
the
state's
own
criteria
for
what
sorts
of
populations
should
be
in
districts,
you
can
nonetheless
draw
a
majority
black
district.
that
would
satisfy
the
first
prong
of
gingles.
we
did
that
in
this
case.
the
second
way
of
doing
that--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
that's
not
the
sole
criterion,
of
course,
justice
scalia.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
to
begin
with--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
their
answer
might
be,
your
honor,
that
they
don't
think
that
representing
black
people
on
the
state
supreme
court
is
as
important
as
representing
cajuns,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
they
have
the
districts
that
they
have
now.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
right.
and
if
there
were
a
nefarious
motive
for
this
statute
it
would
clearly
fall
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
regardless
of
one-person
one-vote's
applicability.
you
can't
discriminate
against
black
voters
simply
because
they
are
not
that
numerous
or
because
one-person
one-vote
doesn't
apply.
given
that,
if
you
ask
how
do
we
determine
whether
there
is
an
alternative
structure,
and
after
all,
that
is
what
gingles'
first
factor
asks,
is
there
an
alternative
to
the
existing
one-person,
the
existing
multi-member
districting
scheme
in
which
black
citizens
or
latinos
would
have
the
potential
to
elect
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
that
is
what
the
court
says
on
pages
49
through
50
of
its
opinion.
and
i
think
also
that
that's
the
burden
of
the
example
at
the
beginning
of
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
in
the
judgment.
given
that,
that
is
one
way
of
measuring.
the
second
way
of
measuring
is
to
say
all
right,
the
state
doesn't
have
to
have
equipopulous
districting,
but
let's
use
that
as
an
illustrative
tool.
that
was
done
in
this
case
as
well.
if
the
state
of
louisiana
were
to
have
7
districts
with
absolutely
equal
populations
in
them,
it
would
still
be
possible
to
draw
a
majority
black
district
centered
on
orleans
parish
and
contiguous
parts
of
jefferson
parish,
which
are
majority
black.
that
was
proved
at
trial
by
the
united
states
as
plaintiff
intervenor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
to
begin
with
in
this
case,
as
i
already
alluded
to,
the
districting
size
that
the
state
already
has.
that's
a
principled
basis.
if
the
state
of
louisiana--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
justice
souter,
in
this
case
because
it's
a
state
supreme
court,
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
state
of
louisiana
had
one
district
with
3
million
people
in
it
and
another
district
with
12
people
in
it,
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
would
be
arbitrary,
regardless
of
whether
one-person
one-vote
applied.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
salyer
against
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district.
it
held
that
even
when
one-person
one-vote
principles
don't
apply,
the
state
still
has
to
comport
with
the
equal
protection
clause
principles.
and
i
think
that
those
principles
allow
you
to
use
as
an
illustrative
example...
because
that
is
all
that
the
first
prong
of
gingles
asked,
is
is
there
an
alternative
to
the
present
system
which
would
afford
minorities
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate
and
to
elect
the
candidates
of
their
choice.
if
you
can
show
that,
that
establishes
that
first
prong
of
gingles.
it
doesn't
require
the
state
to
adopt
that
as
the
remedy
at
all.
indeed,
one
thing
that
may
be
of
interest
to
the
court
is
that
the
districts
upon
which
this
court
rested
in
gingles
in
finding
dilution
were
not
the
districts
that
were
ultimately
adopted
at
the
remedial
phase.
because
the
state
had
the
right
to
come
back
with
another
set
of
districts,
and
as
long
as
those
districts
fully
remedied
the
violation,
the
state
is
free
to
do
what
it
wants.
the
second...
the
third
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
that
is
that
in
light
of
the
decision
by
this
court
in
wells
against
edwards,
that's
a
summary
affirmance.
i
think
that
the
dissent
had
the
better
of
the
argument
there,
but
you
needn't
go
that
far
in
order
to
find
that
there
was
a
mechanism
for
establishing
dilution
in
this
case.
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
address
is
the
role
of
section
2(b),
because
i
think
that
goes
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
referenda
are
covered.
section
14(c)(1),
the
definitional
provision
of
the
act,
says
that
the
word
"vote"
includes
any
election
at
which
propositions
are
voted
on,
as
well
as
candidates.
now
section
2
of
the
act
is
the
only
nationwide
prohibition
on
discrimination,
and
my
answer
would
be
that
section
2
in
part
(a)
defines
what
is
prohibited,
and
part
(b)
is
just
one
illustration
of
how
to
go
about
proving
that.
and
i'd
like
to
give
a
concrete
example
of
how
you
might
challenge
a
referenda.
suppose,
for
example,
in
a
county
that
is
majority
black
but
in
which
blacks
are
segregated
in
certain
parts
of
the
county,
you
have
to
get
a
certain
number
of
signatures
to
get
an
initiative
on
a
ballot
from
each
precinct
in
the
county,
and
there
is
racial
polarization
and
black
people
can't
get
any
signatures
in
a
white
area.
you
might
be
able
to
challenge
that
referenda
provision
for
signatures
and
petitions
under
the
results
clause
because
it
dilutes
the
strength
there
of
a
black
majority.
so
it's
not
just
election
of
representatives
that
is
covered
by
the
act.
even
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
word
representatives
doesn't
include
judges,
it
would
still
have
to
grapple
with
2(a),
which
says
no
voting
rights
standard
practice
or
procedure,
and
that
includes
ones
in
which
no
candidate
is
chosen
at
all.
finally
with
regard
to
the
question
of
merit
selection,
yes,
the
voting
rights
act
would
apply
to
merit
selections
as
well
because,
for
example,
if
the
state
set
up
its
districts
so
that
no
matter
what
blacks
did,
whether
they
voted
to
retain
a
judge
or
to
throw
him
out,
they
were
always
outvoted
in
that
retention
election
by
a
white
block
vote,
then
the
structure
of
the
districts
could
be
challenged
itself.
lastly
i
wanted
to
turn--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
justice
o'connor.
a
section
2
claim
could
be
made
out.
the
state
would
retain
the
ability
to
come
up
with
a
number
of
other
ways
of
electing
that
five
justice
court.
they
could
continue
to
elect
them
at
large
by,
for
example,
using
cumulative
voting.
what
that
would
allow,
any
group
that
was
greater
than
15
percent
of
the
population,
because
1
over
6
is
the
threshold
of
exclusion
there--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--it's
not
proportional
representation
for
two
reasons,
justice
kennedy.
the
first
is
that
it
says
nothing
about
who
actually
serves
on
the
court.
we
don't
claim
in
our
case,
and
i
don't
think
any
petitioners
have
claimed,
that
it's
a
right
to
have
a
black
person
sitting
on
the
bench.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
to
give
black
citizens
in
louisiana
a
say
on
who
sits
on
the
supreme
court,
the
same
as--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--candidates
of
their
choice.
now
this
court
has
made
clear
it's
not
necessarily--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
it's
not
proportional--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's
what
the
senate
sought
to
avoid,
is
the
idea
that
you
had
to
have
a
token
black
person
on
every
body
in
order
to,
in
order
to
satisfy
the
voting
rights
act.
but
black--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--it
is,
but
it's
not
proportional
representation,
justice
kennedy.
it's
a
right
to
participate
in
the
system
equally
with
all
other
voters.
what
louisiana
does
today
is
it
gives
410
whites--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
just
a
quibble.
i
think,
you
know,
this
court
recognized
in
gingles
that
there
is
a
certain
tension
between
measuring
dilution
and
forbidding
a
claim
of
proportional
representation.
the
way
that
plaintiffs
get
around
that
is
we're
not
claiming
a
right
to
proportional
representation.
we're
claiming
that
the
present
system
dilutes
our
ability
to
participate
equally,
because
due
to
racial
block
voting,
due
to
a
history
of
discrimination,
due
to
racial
appeals
and
campaigns
and
the
like,
black
citizens
in
louisiana
are
not
able
to
participate
in
the,
to
the
same
degree
that
white
citizens
are
able
to
participate
in
selecting
a
supreme
court
that
rules
all
of
them.
and
that's
what
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
is.
it's
not
a
complaint
about
proportional
representation.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
may
i
have
leave
to
answer
that
question?
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i'm
not
telling
you
it's
irrelevant.
i
think
it
has
tremendous
symbolic
importance
and
importance
in
respect
for
the
law.
but
if
the
black
citizens
of
orleans
parish
chose
to
elect
a
white
person
to
the
supreme
court,
they
would
be
satisfied
and
we
would
be
satisfied
that
the
law
has
worked,
just
as
when
they
elected
a
white
person
from
the
district
that
was
set
up
after
major
against
treen.
thank
you.
