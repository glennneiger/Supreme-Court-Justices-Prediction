a

justice

or
do
we
use
the
common
phrase?
if
the
people
in
this
county
vote
for
a
judge,
doesn't
that
judge
feel
that
he
represents
them?
justice
marshall
well,
doesn't
he
in
fact
represent
them?
justice
marshall
and
don't
you
think
that
requires
one-person
one-vote?
justice
marshall
well,
i
notice
you
say
one-man
one-vote.

the
one-person--
