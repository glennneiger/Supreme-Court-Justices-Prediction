justice
blackmun
and
has
the
travel
agent
suggested
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
respondents,
mr.
and
mrs.
shute,
live
in
the
state
of
washington
and
they
had
purchased
passage
for
a
pleasure
cruise
on
a
ship
owned
by
the
petitioner,
carnival
cruise
lines.
and
the
tickets
contained
a
clause
designating
florida
courts
as
the
place
for
the
resolution
of
any
dispute.
the
respondents
boarded
the
cruise
ship
in
los
angeles,
and
on
the
cruise,
mrs.
shute
was
injured
in
a
fall.
she
filed
suite
in
federal
court
in
the
state
of
washington.
it
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
cruise
line.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
the
forum-selection
clause
should
not
be
enforced
because
it
was
not
freely
bargained
for
and
because
the
plaintiffs
were
physically
and
financially
incapable
in
pursuing
the
litigation
in
florida.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
it
is
true
that
a
freely
negotiated
forum-selection
clause
of
course
should
be
given
full
effect.
this
clause,
however,
was
not
the
subject
of
bargaining.
but
nevertheless,
a
responsible
forum
clause
in
a
forum
contract
of
this
kind
may
be
permissible.
if
this
happens,
a
cruise
could
subject
for
lying
to
litigation
in
several
places,
so
the
cruise
line
has
a
special
interest
in
limiting
these
fora.
further,
the
clause
is
the
helpful
effect
of
sparing
time
and
expense
and
determining
where
suits
may
be
brought.
the
present
dispute
does
not
an
essentially
a
local
one
inherently
more
suited
to
resolution
in
washington
than
in
florida.
the
shutes
do
not
claim
lack
of
notice
of
the
clause.
they
have
not
sustained,
in
our
view,
the
heavy
burden
required
to
set
aside
the
clause
on
grounds
of
inconvenience.
these
clauses
are
subject
to
judicial
scrutiny
for
fundamental
fairness.
there
is
no
indication
here
that
petitioner
selected
florida
to
discourage
the
pursuit
of
legitimate
claims.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
justice
marshall.
