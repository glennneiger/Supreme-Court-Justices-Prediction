mr.
richard
k.
willard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
long
arm
statute
constitutionally
can
reach
a
nonresident
defendant
in
a
case
involving
an
out-of-state
accident
based
on
the
defendant's
advertising
and
promotional
activities
within
the
state.
now
this
is
not
a
general
jurisdiction
case.
both
courts
below
found
that
carnival
had
not
engaged
in
the
kind
of
continuous
and
systematic
contacts
with
the
state
of
washington
that
would
support
an
assertion
of
general
jurisdiction,
and
the
plaintiff
has
not
chosen
to
raise
that
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
each
question,
justice
scalia,
is
independent
and
the
court
could
certainly
resolve
the
case
in
our
favor
by
deciding
the
second
issue,
the
second
question
presented--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
and
the
other
one
is
not
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
the
court
has
certainly
indicated
that
that
is
appropriate.
i
would
propose,
if
the
court
pleases,
to
go
ahead
with
the
first
question
presented,
although
i
understand
that
they're
both
independent
issues.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
the
court
of
appeals,
although
it
rejected
generalist
jurisdiction,
found
specific
jurisdiction,
because
it
said
there
was
a
sufficient
nexus
in
this
case
between
the
carnival's
advertising
activities
in
the
state
of
washington
and
the
resulting...
and
the
ultimate
accident.
they
applied
a
test
of
but
for
causation.
the
court
said
that
but
for
carnival's
advertising
and
promotional
activities,
mrs.
shute
would
not
have
gone
on
this
cruise
and
but
for
going
on
the
cruise,
of
course,
she
would
not
have
been
injured.
we
submit
that
this
connection
is
too
tenuous
to
support
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction.
and
we
recognize
the
state
of
washington
has
an
interest
in
providing
a
forum
for
its
residents
who
may
want
to
pursue
claims
for
injuries
they
have
suffered
while
traveling
out
of
state.
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
that
kind
of
interest
is
sufficient
to
support
an
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
a
nonresident
defendant.
no
matter
how
strong
the
state's
interest
in
providing
a
convenient
forum
for
its
plaintiffs
to
pursue
claims,
those
claims
still
must
arise
out
of
or
relate
to
contacts
with
the
forum
state
by
the
defendant
in
order
to
support
an
assertion
of
long
arm
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
been
mindful
of
the
territorial
limits
on
state
power
in
connection
with
the
assertion
of
personal
jurisdiction,
and
those
territorial
contacts
here
are
pretty
close
to
their
nadir.
here
we
have
a
nonresident
corporation
that
does
not
have
continuous
and
systematic
contacts
in
a
case
involving
acts
of
negligence
which
occurred
out-of-state
and
which
caused
injury
out-of-state.
thus,
this
case
is
readily
distinguishable
for
situations
where
a
defendant,
for
example,
may
send
a
libellous
publications
into
a
state
or
may
send
a
defective
product
into
a
state
where
it
causes
injury.
in
this
case,
all
of
the
acts
on
which
liability
is
based
and
all
of
the
injuries
that
support
the
claim
for
damages
occurred
out-of-state.
the
sole
contact
of
the
defendant
with
the
state
involved
the
advertising
and
promotional
activities
and
the
relationship
between
these
activities
and
the
allegations
of
negligence
and
failing
to
maintain
a
safe
passageway
through
the
galley
are
so
slight
as
to
create
really
a
virtual
fiction.
this
case
is
many
ways
like
the
case
of
kulko
against
superior
court.
in
that
case,
as
the
court
recalled,
you
rejected
an
assertion
of
jurisdiction
in
a
case
where,
admittedly,
the
marriage
of
the
parties
had
originated
in
california
during
a
brief
visit,
but
thereafter
they
moved
to
new
york.
later,
the
wife
moved
back
to
california
and
the
court
held
that
california
could
not
assert
long
arm
jurisdiction
over
the
husband,
who
had
remained
in
new
york.
now
it
could
be
said
that
the
marriage
in
that
case
was
a
but
for
cause
of
the
subsequent
lawsuit
to
establish
a
divorce
decree,
since
but
for
a
marriage
you
do
not
have
a
divorce.
but
the
court
did
not
devote
much
attention
and
found
it
unnecessary
even
to
seriously
consider
the
thought
that
the
prior
marriage
in
california,
even
though
that
sort
of
a
but
for
cause
could
form
the
basis
for
the
establishment
of
long
arm
jurisdiction
over
the
husband
in
a
lawsuit
involving,
among
other
things,
child
support
and
establishment
of
the
marriage
decree.
so,
for
those
reasons,
we
would
submit
that
the
contacts
here
were
too
tenuous
and
unrelated
to
the
cause
of
action
to
support
an
assertion
of
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
certainly,
justice
kennedy,
if
she
were
to
sue
on
the
basis
of
fraudulent
or
false
advertising,
that
would
be
like
the
keeton
case
in
which
the
contact
with
the
forum
gave
rise
to
the
cause
of
action,
because
the
advertising
itself
would
cause
the
injury.
in
your
hypothetical,
though,
the
advertising
would
not
be
a
necessary
part
of
the
cause
of
action.
she
might
allege
that
the
advertising
promised
a
safe
ship.
but
of
course
she
could
sue
for
negligence
whether
the
advertising
promised
a
safe
ship
or
not.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
in
our
view
it
has
to
have
a
substantive
relationship.
that
is,
it
should
relate
to
the
substance
of
the
cause
of
action
and
not
just
a
sort
of
a
narrative
relationship
in
which
it's
something
that
is
part
of
the
story
that's
told.
and
so,
although
she
could
have
drafted
her
complaint
in
a
way
that
might
have
indicated
that
the
advertising
somehow
contained
a
promise
of
a
safe
ship,
unless
she
were
actually
suing
for
a
breach
of
warranty
or
something
like
that,
it
would
be
necessary
to
a
cause
of
action
for
negligence.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
that
would
be
certainly
a
stronger
case
for
the
assertion
of
specific
jurisdiction
where
the
act
took
place
in
the
forum.
and
in
our
view,
however,
this
is
not
an
issue
that
could
be
resolved
simply
by
clever
pleading.
in
other
words,
simply
putting
a
paragraph
in
the
complaint
that
talked
about
the
advertising
as
somehow
containing
an
implied
representation
would
not
be
enough
unless
it
were
actually
a
lawsuit
based
on
that
theory.
in
our
view,
there's
no
basis
for
asserting
that
kind
of
theory
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
would
be
our
general
view,
although
it's
certainly
possible
that
there
would
be
a
situation
where
some
act
of
negligence
in
another
case
would
have
taken
place...
correct.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
would
be
our
position
here,
because
there's
no
allegation
of
an
act
of
negligence
on
the
land
portion
of
the
journey.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
the
allegation
is
that
water
was
spilled
on
the
galley
during
the
cruise,
and
so
all
of
the
acts
occurred
outside
of
any
state.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
our
view
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
would
not
be,
although
there
would
certainly
be
a
stronger
tie
there.
but
in
our
view
where
the...
all
of
the
acts
of
negligence
occur
out
of
state
and
all
of
the
injury
occurs
out
of
state,
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
cruise
began
and
ended
in
the
state
would
not
be
enough.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
it
could
sue--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--the
plaintiff
could
sue
anywhere
where
she
could
obtain
general
jurisdiction
over
the--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--in
this
case,
it's
florida
which
is
where
carnival
has
its
principal
place
of
business
and
also
where,
in
the
forum
selection
clause
in
the
ticket,
it
is
implicitly
consented
to
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
in
our
view
the
analysis
is
the
same.
the...
congress
has
never
provided
a
special
rule
of
service
for
foreign
defendants
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
and
so
as
long
as
rule
4(e)
provides
that
the
state
long
arm
statute
is
the
basis
for
service
of
process,
this
court's
decision
in
the
omni
case
indicates
that
that
would
be
the
form
of
analysis.
we
certainly
don't
suggest
congress
is
constitutionally
required
to
adopt
that,
and
it
could
if
it
chose
adopt
a
special
rule
for
service
of
foreign
defendants.
but
it
has
not
done
so
in
this
situation.
i
had
indicated
that
there
is
one
place
for
sure
where
carnival
could
be
sued,
and
that
is
florida.
and
that's
because
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business
there,
and
as
the
second
issue
in
the
case
indicates,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
passenger
ticket
requiring
litigation
to
take
place
in
the
state
of
florida.
now
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
respondents
in
this
case
make
two
arguments
as
to
why
this
clause
should
be
not
enforced.
the
first
argument
is
a
very
broad
one,
which
apparently
is
that
ticket
conditions
of
this
nature
are
never
enforceable,
because
passenger
tickets
are
preprinted.
they're
contracts
of
adhesion.
they're
offered
on
a
take-it-or-leave-it
basis.
and
then
their
second
argument
is
that
even
if
this
kind
of
a
clause
is
sometimes
enforceable,
here
in
this
particular
case
it's
so
unreasonable
and
burdensome
that
it
should
not
be
enforced.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
your
honor.
this
court
has
regarded
this
issue
as
one
of
federal
admiralty
law,
and
i
see
no--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
the
majestic,
which
of
course,
predated
erie
was
a
decision
on
a
passenger
ticket
condition.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
don't
believe
this...
well,
under
bremen,
the
court
viewed
that--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--if
it
wasn't
argued
in
the
bremen,
then
this
court
hasn't
decided
it.
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
should
be
a
doubtful
proposition
when
you're
dealing
with
a
question
within
the
court's
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
almost
every
other
aspect
of
admiralty
law
is
viewed
as
federal
law,
and
in
fact
the
court
did
indicate
in
the
bremen
the
importance
of
having
uniform
federal
law
for
admiralty
and
that
certainly
was
one
of
the
reasons
the
constitution
made
that
an
item
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that's
our
position.
is
it
still
a
question
of
federal
admiralty
law,
and
i
think...
i'm
not
aware
of
any
line
of
cases
that
would
indicate
that
that
would
be
questionable.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
that
raises
a
slightly
different
question
as
to
whether
a
suit
brought
under
the
savings
to
suitors
clause
in
state
court,
whether
the
state
court
would
be
required
to
apply
federal
admiralty
law.
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
decisions
from
the
early
part
of
the
20th
century
that
indicate
that
that
would
be
the
case.
and
that's
generally
thought
to
be
true,
but
again
that's
not
specifically
prevented...
presented
here.
i
think
the
better
view
would
be
that
the
state
court
would
be
required
to
follow
federal
law
on
the
enforceability
of
a
forum
selection
clause
in
that
kind
of
a
suit.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
in
our
view
it's
not
at
all
at
odds
with
the
erie
principle,
because
this
falls
in
the
area
of
admiralty
and
maritime
law
where
there
is
a
very
strong
need
which
the
framers
of
the
constitution
recognized
to
have
a
uniform
body
of
law.
it
certainly
would
be
strange
to
think
that
the
states
would
be
empowered
to
make
up
their
own
rules
of
admiralty
law
and
very
burdensome
to
the
orderly
conduct
of
maritime
business
to
have
different
states
having
different
laws
that
would
apply
here.
the...
with
regard
to
the
broader
issue
of
whether,
as
a
matter
of
federal
admiralty
law,
this
kind
of
provision
should
ever
be
enforced,
there's
a
longstanding
body
of
case
law
that
holds
that
ticket
conditions
are
valid
if
they're
reasonably
communicated.
and
in
this
case
the
respondents
do
not
challenge
that
these
conditions
were
reasonably
communicated
within
the
meaning
of
that
body
of
law.
their
argument
is,
instead,
that
they
just
should
never
be
enforced.
in
this
regard,
there
is
a
statute,
the
limited
liability
act,
that
regulates
but
does
not
outlaw
ticket
provisions
in
steamship
passenger
tickets.
the
law
says
the
ticket
condition
of
this
nature
cannot--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
limited
liability
acts,
sections
183(b)
and
(c)
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
provides
that
ticket
conditions
cannot
disclaim
liability
for
negligence.
they
can't
require
arbitration.
they
can't
require
less
than
6
months'
notice,
and
they
can't
require
a
lawsuit
to
be
filed
in
less
than
a
year.
but
they
do
not
say
you
can't
have
a
forum
selection
clause
in
a
ticket.
in
our
view,
when
congress
chose
in
this
particular
area
to
regulate
ticket
conditions
to
a
certain
extent,
but
chose
not
to
prohibit
forum
selection
clauses,
this
court
should
not
go
further
and
on
its
own
outlaw
forum
selection
clauses,
or
for
that
matter,
particularly
on
a
theory
that
ticket
conditions
are
products
of
contracts
of
adhesion.
to
the
fallback
argument
in
this
case
that
petitioners
make
is
that
even
if
forum
selection
clauses
are
generally
all
right,
that
florida
is
an
unreasonable
and
burdensome
forum
in
this
case.
but
their
argument
here
really
confuses
what
would
be
a
proper
forum,
non
conveniens-type
analysis
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
contractual
forum
choice
should
be
enforced.
the
question
here
is
not
is
florida
the
most
reasonable
forum,
but
is
the...
florida
such
an
unreasonable
forum
that
the
contractual
choice
should
be
disregarded.
in
our
view,
however,
even
if
the
question
were
what
is
the
most
reasonable
forum,
the
answer
would
be
florida.
in
fact,
if
carnival
were
to
designate
in
all
of
its
tickets
that
all
lawsuits
had
to
be
litigated
in
the
state
of
washington,
that
would
be
far
more
unreasonable
than
what
we
have
here.
florida
is
where
carnival
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
its...
most
of
its
ships
arrive
and
depart
at
one
time
or
another
from
florida.
the
headquarters,
the
books,
records,
and
other
information
is
available.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
one
reason
why
it
is
reasonable
to
have
a
single
forum
is
that
the
time
a
cruise
occurs
it's
difficult
to
know
where
all
of
the
witnesses
in
evidence
will
be
months
or
years
later
when
a
lawsuit
occurs.
for
example,
the
respondents
seems
to
suggest
that
if
the
designated
forum
had
been
the
place
where
the
ship
departed
and
returned,
that
would
have
been
more
reasonable,
by
analogy
to
the
hodes
case
which
designated
naples.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
the
reason--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that's
correct
and
so
miami
is
chosen,
because
that's
where
the
company
is
headquartered.
and
so
that
is
more
likely
to
be
a
forum
where
at
least
some
documents,
some
witnesses
will
be
available.
the
company's
records
are
there.
its
ships
frequently
land
and
take
off
there,
so
employees
of
the
shipping
line
may
be
thought
to
be
more
readily
available
there
than
they
would
be
somewhere
else.
but
back
to
the
question,
if
i
may,
of
whether
it's
reasonable
to
select
one
forum
rather
than
saying
every
passenger
can
bring
a
lawsuit
in
their
own
home
city.
many
situations
can
arise
in
which
an
incident
involves
passengers
from
all
over
the
country.
carnival
carries
hundreds
of
thousands
of
passengers
from
all
of
the
states
and
many
foreign
countries.
and
if
each
of
them
could
go
home
and
file
a
lawsuit
about
an
injury,
there
would
be
a
litigation
on
these
conditions
all
over
the
country,
maybe
arising
out
of
the
same
incident.
we
cite
the
california...
the
williams
litigation
in
california
in
our
briefs.
and
that
case,
which
carnival
has
sought
a
stay
from
this
court
and
announced
an
intention
to
file
a
petition
for
certiorari,
involves
this
same
forum
selection
issue.
there,
over
200
passengers
from
a
number
of
different
states
filed
a
lawsuit
claiming
to
have
been
injured
in
an
incident
of
rough
passage
on
the
same
cruise
from
los
angeles
to
puerto
vallarto.
now,
if
all
of
them
could
go
home
and
litigate
the
same
issue
in
different
state
courts
or
federal
courts,
that
would
be
very
inefficient
and
burdensome.
and
so
by
designating
a
signal
forum
in
the
passenger
ticket,
carnival's
designation
serves
the
interest
of
judicial
efficiency
as
well
as
reducing
its
costs
by
providing
that
all
the
litigation
should
take
place
in
one
place.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's
certainly
true
if
they
file
in
federal
court,
justice
stevens,
but
under
the
savings
to
suitors
clause,
they
can
file
in
state
court.
and--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--if
there
is
not
complete
diversity,
you
cannot
remove.
but
it
was--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
it
depends
on
who
else
they
name.
in
the
california
case
i
was
just
mentioning
that
we
cited
in
our
briefs,
they
named
some
in-state
defendants
as
well--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--in
order...
and
some
john
doe
defendants
under
state
practice
in
order
to
defeat
diversity
and
prevent
removal.
so
there
would
be
some
cases
where
that
could
happen.
so,
in
summary,
our
view
is
that
it
makes
sense
in
a
situation
where
a
cruise
line
operates
with
passengers
from
all
different
states
as
well
as
different
countries
to
designate
in
the
ticket
a
single
forum.
and
certainly
if
a
single
forum
had
to
be
designated,
florida
is
the
most
reasonable
forum
that
could
have
been
selected
in
this
case.
and
therefore,
it's
our
position
that
the
clause
should
be
enforced.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
my
it
please
the
court:
the
one
question
i
wanted
to
address
was
the
one
of
the
choice
of
law.
the
ninth
circuit
did
hold,
and
it's
in
their
opinion
in
page
21a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
that
federal
law
governs
the
validity
of
the
forum
selection
clause,
citing
manetti-farrow
and
a
ninth
circuit
decision.
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
thus,
the
starting
point
for
analysis
is
the
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
bremen.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
but
it
cited
the
bremen,
so
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
that
was...
it
was
deciding
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
admiralty
law
rather
than
looking
to
state
law
as
the
source
of
that
doctrine.
similarly,
we
did
cite
in
our
opening
brief
at
page
21
in
footnote
18
two
decisions
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
the
steamship
passenger
ticket
contract
would
be
governed
by
federal
admiralty
law,
one
actually
as
recently
as
1956.
so
our
position
is
that
this
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
now
the
question
of
whether
federal
law
would
control
if
this
case
were
in
state
court
or
perhaps
if
it
had
been
brought
on
the
law
side
of
a
federal
court
is
one
to
which
we
think
this
court's
decisions
in
the
past
have
indicated
federal
law
would
control,
and
we
think
that's
the
better
view.
but
obviously
it's
not
presented
in
this
case.
it
was
brought
as
an
admiralty
case
in
federal
court.
i
would
be
happy
to
respond
to
any
additional
question
the
court
has.
