justice
o'connor
even
if
the
agreement
is
entered
into
within
a
particular
state
where
jurisdiction
is
asserted?
justice
o'connor
is
that
somewhat
at
odds
with
the
erie
principle?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
forum
selection
clause
is
enforceable,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
was
special
jurisdiction.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
law
governs
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
is
that
what
was
applied,
do
you
think,
by
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
o'connor
i
didn't
get
that
impression
at
all
from
the
opinion.
justice
o'connor
and
the
court...
the
ninth
circuit
also
said
alternatively
that
there
was
an
independent
justification
for
refusal
to
enforce
the
clause...
i'm
looking
at
page
24a...
because
of
the
lack
of
inconvenience
and
lack
of
relationship
between
the
chosen
forum
and
the
transaction.
