justice
scalia
mr.
willard,
you
say
this
question
you're
about
to
discuss
is
the
first
question
in
the
case.
is
it
necessarily
the
first?
would
we
ever
have
to
resolve
this
if
we
resolve
the
other
one
preliminarily?
justice
scalia
and
this
one's
a
constitutional
question,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
and
the
other
one
is
not.
justice
scalia
we'd
normally
do
the
other
one
first
then,
wouldn't
we?
justice
scalia
please
do
so.
justice
scalia
mr.
willard,
what
if
you...
i
understood
your
brief
to
suggest
that
the
outcome
here
would
be
different
if
the
cause
of
action
had
been
for
breach
of
contract.
suppose
they'd
simply
claimed
that
there
was
a
warranty
of
safety
implicit
in
the
undertaking
so
that
instead
of
suing
in
tort,
they
are
suing
in
assumpsit.
justice
scalia
mr.
willard,
before
you
get
into
those
two
arguments,
is
it
clear
to
you
and
should
it
be
clear
to
us
that
this
is
a
question
of
purely
federal
law
and
it
doesn't
matter
how
the
state
of
washington
would
have
treated
this
forum
selection
clause?
justice
scalia
when
did
we
do
that?
justice
scalia
what
about
post-erie?
do
you
know
a
case
where
the
point
was
argued
where
we've
decided
that?
justice
scalia
it
wasn't
argued.
justice
scalia
so
you'd
say
washington
has
to
follow
us.
you'd
still
achieve
uniformity,
but
instead
of
our
following
the
state
of
washington,
the
state
of
washington,
had
this
suit
been
brought
in
state
courts,
would
have
to
follow
our
view
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
forum
selection
clause.
justice
scalia
well,
it
will
be
the
most
reasonable
if
you
have
to
pick
one
place,
but
it
could
have
designated
on
all
its...
you
know
on
its
tickets
that
all
suits
brought
by
citizens
of
washington
shall
be
brought
in
washington.
you're
insisting
on
one
forum
for
everything.
maybe
that's
unreasonable.
justice
scalia
mr.
wall,
i
thought
as
far...
maybe
i
got
my
facts
mixed
up...
but
i
thought
as
far
as
carnival
cruise
lines
is
concerned,
the
sale
took
place
in
florida.
but
your
client
bought
it...
bought
the
ticket
from
a
travel
agent,
but
the
travel...
but
the
sale
by
carnival
lines
was
made
in
florida.
am
i
wrong
about
that
or
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
well,
it's
clear
that
her
purchase
occurred
in
washington.
it
may
not
be
clear
that
carnival's
sale
occurred
in
washington.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
the
arrangements
were.
maybe
the
travel
agent
stood
liable
for
the
money.
i
mean,
the
travel
agent
may
buy
and
resell
these
things.
i
don't
know
what
the
arrangement
is.
justice
scalia
but
that's
general
jurisdiction...
i
mean
it
sounds
like
general
jurisdiction
you're
talking
about.
you
say
induces
people
in
general,
therefore
they
ought
to
be
liable.
you
didn't
say
induce
this
person,
because
we
really
don't
know
whether
this
person
was
induced
by
the
advertising.
justice
scalia
what
if
this
company
had
never
sent
any
other
advertising
into
the
state...
in
fact
didn't
even
send
in
this
advertising.
but
this
travel
agent
happened
to
be
in
florida
and
picked
up
this
brochure
from
carnival
cruise
lines,
takes
it
back
to
the
state.
however,
shows
that
brochure
in
the
state
of
washington
to
this
plaintiff.
you
think
that
would
not
be
enough
then?
because
that's
certainly
not
a
substantial
business
contact.
justice
scalia
well,
why
do
you
say
there's
an
overwhelming
bargaining...
this
is
a
big
corporation
and
just
one
individual,
but
you
know
when
i
go
into
a
showroom
and
decide
whether
or
not
i'm
going
to
buy
a
car
from
general
motors,
general
motors
and
i
are
even-steven
as
far
as
bargaining
power
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me.
you
know,
unless
there's
some
reason
like
i
need
a
car
or
i
will
lose
my
inheritance
or
something
like
that.
i
need
a
car
within
10
seconds.
you're
not
talking
about
food.
you're
talking
about
a
pleasure
cruise.
you're
client
didn't
have
to
go
on
a...
on
this
boat.
she
didn't
have
to
go
on
any
boat.
she
didn't
have
to
go
on
a
vacation.
she
could
have
stayed
home.
what
was
the
disparity
in
bargaining
power?
justice
scalia
oh,
well,
that
doesn't
go
to
bargaining
power.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
goes
to
whether
it
is
a
take-it-or-leave-it
type
contract,
but
she's
still
entirely
free
to
leave
it.
justice
scalia
it's
a
different
point
from
the
one
that
bremen
was
making.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
what
the
bremen
meant
by
disparity
of
bargaining
power?
justice
scalia
of
course
the
federal
statute
doesn't
say
that.
i
mean,
congress
has
addressed
what,
you
know,
what's
likely
to
be
unreasonable
in
steamship
tickets,
and
it
hasn't
said
that
you
can't
include
this
kind
of
a
clause.
justice
scalia
you're
not
saying
it's
something
that
they
ought
to
have.
you
would
have
no
objection
to
this,
i
gather,
if
your
client
had
been
protected...
presented
with
a
ticket
that
said
check
here
if
you're
willing
to
agree
that
you
can
sue
only
in
florida
in
which
case
your
ticket
will
be
$10
cheaper,
because
it's
going
to
cost
us
a
lot
more
to
defend
suits
all
around
the
country.
that
would
have
been
okay,
right?
justice
scalia
that
wouldn't
have
been
okay
either?
justice
scalia
xxx.
