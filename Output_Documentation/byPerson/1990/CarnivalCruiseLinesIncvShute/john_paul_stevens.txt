justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this?
this
accident
took
place
in
international
waters,
as
i
understand
it.
so
is
it
correct
that
under
your
view
of
the
proper
causation,
the
only
places
in
the
united
states
where
the
defendant
could
be
use
would
be
where
general
jurisdiction
would
be
available?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
talking
about
this
case,
where
the
act
of
negligence
allegedly
was
she
slipped
in
what
she...
visiting
part
of
the
ship,
as
i
remember.
justice
stevens
so
that
even
if
the
ship
had
docked
in
seattle
but
still
not
often
enough
to
support
general
jurisdiction,
but
she
had
gotten
on
board
the
ship
and
sailed,
and
so
that
still
would
not
justify
it
then?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
doesn't
that
indicate
miami
as
unreasonable?
to
assume
all
suits
should
be
brought
in
miami.
justice
stevens
you
suggest
that
you
don't
know
where
the
witnesses
will
be.
justice
stevens
don't
the
federal
rules
have
some
kind
of
provision
for
consolidating
all
these
cases
when
you
have
a
large
accident
like
this?
justice
stevens
can't
you
remove?
justice
stevens
but
you're
talking
about
individual
suits
by
200
different
plaintiffs,
and
each
one
of
those,
i
suppose,
there
would
be
complete
diversity?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
why
do
you...
why
do
you
say
there
must
be
substantial
business
contact?
the
washington
statute
doesn't
say
that,
as
i
read
it.
it
says
there
must
be
some
act
or
some
transaction
in
the
forum
state
and
then
they
say
they...
actually
they
say
that
in
the
second
part,
either
arise
from
or
be
connected
with
the
action.
justice
stevens
but
where
do
you
get
the
requirement
of
a
substantial
business
in
the
state?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
well,
i
wonder
if
you
mean
that.
supposing
that
the
travel
agent
is
a
full-time
employee,
for
the
moment,
that
came
to
washington
to
deliver
the
ticket
or
something,
and
while
delivering
it,
the
person
picked
up
a
ride
and
they
got
in
an
automobile
accident
together
to
the
negligence
of
the
agent.
couldn't
you
sue
the
parent?
could
you
sue
the
corporation
there?
justice
stevens
yes,
i'm
assuming
she
is.
justice
stevens
i
see.
but
suppose...
all
right.
but
i
was
thinking...
well,
say
they
drove
across
into
oregon.
he
picked...
i
don't
know.
that's
too
hypothetical.
justice
stevens
mr.
wall,
can
i
review
my
ignorance
in
a
question
to
you?
i
know
it's
fairly
common
in
state
court
decisions,
but
have
we
ever
had
any
opinions
in
which
we
discussed
the
two
categories,
specific
versus
general
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
helicopteros
does
it.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
kind
of
asking
for
sort
of
a
middle
type...
and
i'm
not
saying
it's
an
impermissible
argument,
but
it's
not
the
classic
specific
jurisdiction
case,
and
it's
not
the
classic
general
jurisdiction
case
either.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
does
this
sliding
scale
notion
originate
in
that
same
law
review
note
that
the
washington
supreme
court
relied
on
or
is
that--
justice
stevens
--they
say
the
whole
thing
started
in
some
georgetown
student's
law
review
note
as
i
remember
it.
