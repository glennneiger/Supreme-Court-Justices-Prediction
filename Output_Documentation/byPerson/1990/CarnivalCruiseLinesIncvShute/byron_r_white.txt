justice
white
well,
where
could
the
plaintiff
sue?
justice
white
anywhere?
nowhere?
justice
white
well,
where
is
that,
for
example?
justice
white
for
the
purposes
of
our
analysis
and
yours
on
this
part
of
the
case,
would
it
make
any
difference
if
she
could
not
have
sued
in
florida,
if
she
would
have
had
to
go
to
a
foreign
country?
or
is
the
analysis
the
same?
justice
white
do
you
agree
that
the
accident
must
be
said
to
have
arisen
out
of
the
acts
of
the
defendant
in
the
state?
justice
white
well,
that's
all
you're
relying
on,
isn't
it?
justice
white
mr.--
--the
act
out
of
which
this
accident
you
say
arose
was
the
sale
of
tickets?
justice
white
the
solicitation
in
washington
and
the
sale
of
the
ticket
to
this
person?
justice
white
well,
how
did
they
advertise?
just
through
magazines,
national
magazines,
or
did
they
have
specific
advertisements
on
radio,
or
television,
or
in
newspapers
or--
justice
white
--in
newspapers?
justice
white
travel
agents
have
their
brochures?
justice
white
do
you
know
exactly
how
this
particular
purchase
took
place?
did
your
client
want
to
go
on
a
trip
and
come
to
the
travel
agent
and
say,
what
have...
have
you
got
any
suggestions?
justice
white
so
she
didn't
see
any
of
these
advertisements
in
this...
she
just...
the
whole
thing
happened
with
the
travel
agent?
justice
white
burger
king
was
a
contract
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
so
you
say
at
least
it
says
specific
jurisdiction?
