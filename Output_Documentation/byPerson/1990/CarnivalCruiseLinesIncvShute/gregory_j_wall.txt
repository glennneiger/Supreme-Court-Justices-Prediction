mr.
gregory
j.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
brought
in
admiralty
in
the
western
district
of
washington
dealing
with
an
injury
to
a
washington
resident
which
occurred
in
international
waters.
the
question
for
this
court
is
whether
that
case
can
be
brought
where
the
plaintiff
purchased
her
tickets,
where
she
resides,
where
the
witnesses
mainly
reside,
or
will
she
have
to
travel
3,000
miles
to
probably
the
farthest
point
in
the
continental
united
states
from
where
she
resides
to
try
this
case
and
to
do
so
in
a
state
where
there
are
no
witnesses
which
are
relevant
to
this
lawsuit
and
which,
in
effect,
have
very
little
to
do
with
this
lawsuit.
the
petitioner
has
taken
the
position,
both
in
oral
argument
and
in
its
brief,
that
due
process
only
allows
it
to
be
sued
where
its
corporate
headquarters
are
currently
located
which
is
in
miami,
florida.
we
take
the
position
that
due
process,
based
upon
their
contacts
with
the
state
of
washington,
allow
them
to
be
sued
in
washington.
and
the
forum
selection
clause
i
will
address
a
little
bit
later,
but
we
take
the
position
that
it
essentially
shouldn't
be
enforced
in
this
case,
because
it
is
unreasonable
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
counsel's
correct
that
the
contacts
with
the
state
of
washington
are
primarily
promotional
and
advertising
in
nature.
however,
many
of
these...
some
of
these
promotions
took
place
in
the
state
of
washington...
these
seminars
for
travel
agents.
he
left,
however,
the
very
important
ones
which
are
the
sales
of
these
tickets
in
the
state
of
washington
which
occur
there,
and
in
addition,
the
purchasing
of
travel
agents'
services,
essentially,
by
paying
a
commission.
these
are
significant
contacts,
and
they
are
systematic
and
they
are
continuous.
while
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
feel
they
were
sufficient
for
the
exertion
of
general
jurisdiction,
we've
never
taken
that
position.
but
in
any
case,
we
feel
that
a
specific
jurisdiction
is
warranted
here.
this
case
has
already
been
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit,
because
of
a
question...
because
state
laws
play
such
a
large
part
in
jurisdictional
questions
involving
the
long
arm
act,
certified
a
question
to
the
washington
supreme
court
which
specifically
asked
them
if
the
long
arm
statute
would
encompass
this
case
if
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
was
sufficient
in
order
to
invoke
long
arm
jurisdiction.
specifically,
does
this
accident
arise
out
of
their
contacts
with
the
state?
in
a
unanimous
decision,
the
washington
supreme
court
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--yes,
your
honor.
if
we
are
relying
on
specific
jurisdiction,
it
has
to
arise
out
of--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--that's
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
we're
relying
on
in
this
case.
and
it
does...
according...
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
since
it--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--we
did
in
the
ninth
circuit,
your
honor,
and
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed
with
us.
they
felt
that
there
were
enough
contacts
here
for
the
exercise
of
specific
jurisdiction
but
that
we
did
not
meet
the
threshold
necessary
for
general
jurisdiction.
the--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--it
arose
out
of
the
minimum
contacts
of
the
defendants
with
the
state
of
washington,
one
of
which
was
the
sale
of
tickets.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
i
suppose
it's
a
matter
of
one's
view,
justice
scalia.
one
is...
my
client
paid
her
money
to
a
travel
agent
and
received
her
money...
received
her
ticket
from
the
same
travel
agent,
who
was
an
agent
paid
a
commission
by
carnival.
carnival's
assertion
is
that,
because
the
ticket
is
printed
in
miami
and
that
it
is...
the
money
is
eventually
received
in
miami,
that
the
sale
took
place
there.
our
contention
is
is
that's
a
rather
illogical
way
of
looking
at
it,
because
cars
are
made
in
detroit
and
the
money
finally...
usually
winds
up
there,
too,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
sale
occurs
there.
it
occurs
where
you
pay
your
money
and
where
you
receive
the
product.
and
in
this
case
my
client
paid
her
money
in
washington
and
received
the
ticket
in
washington
from
the
agent
of
the
defendants.
and
so
we
contend
that
the
sale
and
numerous
sales...
other
sales
take
place
in
washington.
and
i
should
point
out
the
travel
agent
in
this
case
was
specifically
trained
by
carnival
at
seminars
in
the
state.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
according
to
her
affidavit,
which
is
in
the
respondents'
appendix,
she
forwards
the
money
to
carnival.
they
forward
the
ticket
to
her.
she
gives
it
to
my
client.
at
least
from
the
consumer
standpoint,
the
sale
took
place
in
the
state
of
washington.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
they
are
receiving
money
from
citizens
of
the
state
and
that
they
are
providing
a
product
or
a
service,
depending
on
how
it's
related,
certainly
shows
a
business
or
a
commercial
presence
in
the
state
of
washington
in
addition
to
advertising.
and
we've
never
taken
the
position
that
the
advertising
alone
is
sufficient.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
the
petitioner
advertises
both
in
the
national
media,
your
honor,
and
also
in
the
local
media.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
in
newspapers,
magazines,
as
well
as
providing
brochures,
and
in
fact,
then...
the
record
indicates
that
they
regularly
run
large
ads
in
the
largest
newspapers
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
that's
correct.
and
the
travel
agent
in
this
case
attended
seminars
in
the
state
where
she
was
provided
with
brochures
and
essentially
trained
by
carnival
to
sell
their
product,
and
those
were
conducted
inside
our
state
of
washington.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
that
is
precisely
how
it
occurred
and
the
record
would...
has
her
affidavit.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
that's...
the
affidavit
of
mrs.
shute
is
part
of
the
record
and
she
says
she
went
to
the
travel
agent.
she
had
never
been
on
a
cruise
before.
she
discussed
with
the
agent--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--the
travel
agent
is
certainly
the
largest
part
of
it.
and
i
don't
know
whether
she
saw
the
ads
in
the
newspapers
or
not,
quite
frankly.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
it
indicates
that
her
principal
source
of
information
was
the
agent
itself.
in
any
case,
much
is
made
by
petitioner
on
the
question
of
whether
we
should...
"but
for"
should
be
adopted
as
the
ninth
circuit
and
two
other
circuits
have
adopted
it,
the
fifth
and
the
sixth,
i
believe.
but
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
that
question,
whether
this
arises
out
of
the
activity
of
carnival
in
washington
state,
is
a
question
of
state
law
based
upon
civil
rule
4(e).
and
the
only
question
really
before
this
court
is
whether
that
interpretation
of
washington
state
law
violates
due
process.
this
court's
earlier
decisions
have
shown
that...
particularly
the
burger
king
v.
rudzewicz
case...
have
said
that
once
a
substantial
connection
with
the
state
is
established,
once
we
show
that
they
have
substantial
minimum
contacts,
and
we
establish
that
this
arises
out
of
the
accident,
then
it
becomes
a
substantial...
the
burden
is
upon
the
petitioner,
the
person
resisting
jurisdiction
to
come
up
with
the
evidence
to
show
that
there...
this
is
not...
this
is
a
substantial
burden
or
unreasonable
burden
upon
them
in
the
area
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
it
was
a
contract
case,
your
honor,
in
which
the...
in
fact
it
was
a
contract
case
in
which
a
choice
of
law
section
was
imposed.
however,
the
keeton
case
is
also
one
in
which
substantial
contracts,
once
established,
puts
the
burden
upon
the
person
who's
contesting
jurisdiction
in
order
to
show
that
it
is
unreasonable
as
applied
to
them.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
if
the
forum
selection
clause
is
enforceable,
your
honor,
you're
correct.
we're
going
to
florida.
and
so
it
really
doesn't
matter
if
washington
has
jurisdiction
or
not.
i
plan
to
address
that
as
the
second
portion
of
my
argument,
but
i
can
address
it
now
if
the
court
desires.
but
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i
will
discuss
the
last
part
of
my
jurisdictional
argument.
the
burger
king
case
talks
about
the
proximal
relation
between
the
action
itself
and
the
contacts
with
the
state.
proximal
generally
means
but
for,
at
least
the
jury
instruction
we
give
people
in
washington
does.
and
we've
taken
the
position
that
commercial
reality
in
light
of
modern
commercial
practices
have
to
be
considered
when
you
look
at
in
personam
jurisdiction.
this
is
not
a
case
in
1940
or
1949
when
international
shoe
was
decided.
this
is
a
case
now.
and
with
the
modern
state
of
telecommunications
and
computers
and
communications
is
not
necessary
for
carnival
to
have
an
office
in
our
state,
to
have
an
exclusive
agent
in
our
state,
or
to
physically
even
be
in
our
state
in
order
to
do
a
substantial
amount
of
business.
consumers
who
deal
with
people
who
are
doing
a
substantial
amount
of
business
in
the
state
expect
that
they
should
be
able
to
use
the
court
system
with
these
particular
businesses.
businesses
which
are
doing
a
substantial
amount
of
business
in
the
state
should
reasonably
expect
that
they
will
be
hauled
into
court
if
there
is
something
arising
out
of
their
activities.
that's
our
position
in
this
case
in
a
nut
shell
is
that
people...
if
carnival
comes
to
washington
to
do
business,
sells
its
product...
and
it
is
really
a
product...
and
pays
commissions
to
travel
agents
and
induces
people
there
to
take
voyages
on
their
vessels,
then
it
should
also
be
willing
to
stay
in
washington
and
to
let
the
washington
courts
operate
in
particularly
this
case
of
federal--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--well,
we
know
she
was
induced
by
a
travel
agent
who
provided
with
the
advertisements,
your
honor.
and
so
i
think
their
efforts
obviously
are
related
to
this.
this
is...
shute
didn't
get
the
idea
to
go
on
their...
this
particular
cruise
line
by
herself.
she
was
shown
that
by
a
travel
agent
who
was
trained
and
had
emotional
materials
available
from
carnival
cruise
lines.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
it
is
at
least
specific
jurisdiction,
because
it
arises
out
of
their
contacts
with
the
state.
now
the
argument
is
made
that
the
"but
for"
analysis
that
has
been
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
by
the
state
of
washington,
essentially
is
open
ended.
and
we
would
say
that
it
is
not
open
ended,
because
in
most
of
the
examples
given,
particularly
in
petitioner's
brief,
they
leave
out
the
first
step
of
the
"but
for"
test,
which
is
there
must
be
substantial
business
contacts
with
the
state.
in
this
case
there
are
substantial
business
contacts
with
the
state.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
correct.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
because
the
court...
this
court's
decisions
in
the
area
of
due
process
have
said
that
you
must
have
some
substantial
business
connection.
the
burger
king
case
in
particular
uses
that
language.
it
says
there
must
be
a
substantial
relationship
between
the
defendant
and
the
state,
even
for
specific
jurisdiction.
the
washington
statute
does
say
the
transaction
of
business
is
one
of
the
enumerated--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--things
that
operate
the
long
arm
statute,
but
then
it
also
says
it
must
arise
out
of
the
transaction
of
business.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
no,
and
i
would
agree
that
it
is
not
enough.
i
think
in
that
case
that's
a
random
and
a
fortuitous
sort
of
connection
with
the
state,
much
as
if
a
relative
of
mrs.
shute
had
mailed
her
a
brochure
from
florida.
in
that
case,
there
would
not
be
jurisdiction.
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
ask
a
corporation
which
is
not
doing
business
in
the
state
to
be
hauled
into
court
there.
and
in
this
case...
if
that
hypothetical
were
the
case,
or
if...
in
fact
if
all
they
had
done
was
advertising
on
a
national
media,
we
would
take
the...
we
would
not
be
taking
the
position
that
there
was--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--we
would
sue
the
corporation
if
she
were
in
the
course
of
her
employment.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
but
probably
not
under
this
particular
statute.
it
would
be
because
the
accident
occurred
in
the
state
of
washington,
which
is
another
portion
of
the
long
arm
statute.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
yes,
i
understand
the
court's
position.
if
it
was
a
transitory-type
of
presence.
for
instance,
if
the
president
or
the
resident
agent
of
carnival
cruise
lines
happened
to
be
at
sea
tack
airport
and
i
happen
to
be
there
with
a
summons
in
my
hand,
in
that
case,
yes,
i
think
there
would
be
jurisdiction
based
upon
the
court's
decisions
in
that
area.
but
in
this
case,
i
think
the
key
factor
is
is
that
they're
actually
doing
business
in
our
state
and
there
is
a
large
scale...
fairly
large
scale
commercial
presence.
the
last
factor
i'd
like
to
talk
about...
the
substantive
relevance
is
a
term
that's
used
often
in
there
in
their
particular
argument.
it's
a
term
essentially
that
has
no
place
in
the
cases
of
this
court
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
rather
than
giving
a
certain
amount
of
judicial
economy,
i
think...
and
our
position
is
is
that
in
effect
it
gives
the
defendants
another
tool
and
another
fact-specific
type
of
thing
to
argue
with
the
courts
about.
and
if
it's
adopted,
it
essentially
is
going
to
limit
long
arm
jurisdiction
in
cases
like
this
to
contract
cases,
and
i
think
that's
not
the
intention
of
the
long
arm
statute
or
of
the
court's
prior
decisions.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
helicopteros
discusses
it.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
particularly,
justice
brennan's
dissent
discusses
it,
and
it
is
discussed
to
some
extent
in
the
burger
king
case,
too,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
we've...
in
our
brief
we've
talked
about
a
sliding
scale--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--whereas
if
they
have
a
lot
of
activity
but
it's
not
quite
enough
for
general
jurisdiction,
then
perhaps
it
should
be
a
somewhat
more
liberal
arising
out
of--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--i
don't
know
exactly
what
they
relied
upon,
your
honor,
but
i
suspect
that
it
may
come
from
that,
yes.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
it
could
be,
but
i
think
they
looked
at
it
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
if
you're
really
there
doing
business,
there's
no
requirement
in
any
case
i
know
of
that
says
that
the
type
of
contact
and
the
type
of
injury
have
to
be
identical,
which
is
what
the
petitioner
is
arguing
here.
and
we
think
that's
unreasonable
to
a
large
degree.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
only
that
it
is
acknowledged
by
the
petitioner
that
they
pay
a
10
percent
commission
on
all
sales.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
there's
nothing
to
that
extent,
justice
marshall,
other
than
the
commission
and
the
fact
that
they
are
not
the
exclusive
agent.
there
are
other
agents
in
washington
also.
the...
if
i
can
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
the
forum
selection
clause,
with
the
court's
indulgence.
i
should
point
out
that
there
are
several
ways
that
we
feel
this
clause
can
be
invalidated
in
this
case.
it's
not
our
position
that--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--justice
o'connor,
that
is
a
question
which
occurred
to
me
when
it
was
asked
by
i
believe
justice
stevens
here
or
justice
scalia.
the...
ordinarily
passage
contracts
are
matters
of
admiralty
law.
however,
under
the
erie
rule,
procedural
matters
are
generally
matters
of
whatever
the
local
law
is.
now,
in
this
case
we're
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
i
think
it's
going
to
be
federal
admiralty
law
regardless.
if
this
case
were
brought
in
state
court--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
believe
they
have
applied
federal
admiralty
law.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
as
i
say
i
didn't
really
address
this
in
the
brief
because
i
didn't
realize
it
was
that
much
of
a
question,
but
i
think
they
did
apply
federal
maritime
law,
since
i
don't
recall
them
citing
any
particular
washington
state
cases
of
california
state
cases.
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
law
on
this
issue.
and
i
should
point
out
that
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
was
not
that
these
clauses
are
per
se
unreasonable
because
they
are
not
bargained
for.
they
are...
this
particular
clause
is
not
bargained
for,
and
in
fact
the
petitioners
admit
that
and
say
that
they
can't
really
bargain
with
everybody,
which
is
probably
true.
however,
what
they
said
was
it's
not
bargained
for
and
it's
unreasonable.
and
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
if
this
clause
is
to
be
enforced
and
is
to
be
essentially
imposed
on
consumers...
it's
not
an
agreement
that
you
agree
to,
and
i
don't
think
any
passenger
ticket
either
on
a
ship
or
an
airplane
is
one
where
you
sit
down
and
read
it.
people
don't
expect
to
get
in
lawsuit
when
they
go
on
pleasure
cruises...
at
least
my
client
didn't.
and...
but
it
must
at
least
be
a
reasonable
clause.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
your
honor,
basically
the
bremen
case.
the
bremen
case
says
they
are...
these
clauses
are
prima
facie,
reasonable
and
enforceable
unless
there
is
evidence
of
overwhelming
[inaudible].
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
the
court
could
be
correct
on
that
and
i'm
not
sure.
but
they...
at
least
the
implication
of
the
case
is
that
they
did
not
deal...
this
clause...
the
bremen
clause
is
valid
because
the
parties
had
approximately
equal
bargaining
power
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
overwhelming
bargaining
power
or
fraud
or--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i...
excuse
me.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
disparity
in
bargaining
power...
there
are
different
aspects
to
every
transaction,
your
honor,
and
one
of
them...
the
hypothetical
you
just
cited...
certainly
you
have
a
great
deal
of
bargaining
power
by
not
buying
the
car...
in
this
case
my
client
did
want
to
go
on
a
cruise...
or
about
the
price
of
the
car
or
the
terms.
however,
i
suspect
that
if
you
tried
to
bargain
about
the
terms
of
the
warranty,
the
terms
of
the
contract,
you
would
have
a
very
difficult
time.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
she
is
entitled--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
that,
because
in
this
case
if
the
plaintiff
wants
to
buy
this
product,
she
has
to
go
to
a
cruise
line.
and,
as
you
know,
there's
an
amicus
brief
filed
in
this
case
from
the
international
cruise
line
committee,
which
is...
represents
i
believe
10
different
cruise
lines,
in
which
they
essentially
say
we
all
have
these
same
clauses.
so,
there's
no
bargaining
power
on
this
at
all.
if
you
want
to
go
on
a
cruise,
it's
take
it
or
leave
it.
now,
admittedly,
she
doesn't
have
to
go
on
a
cruise
and
it's
not
a
necessity
of
life,
but
neither
are
most
things
and
neither
are
most
contracts
we
enter
into.
but
they
still
should
be
fair.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
i
think
that
the
bremen
means
is
that
if
you
have
two
commercial
entities
who
can
bargain
over
the
contract
terms
and
those
contract
terms
are
accepted,
fair
or
unfair,
you
know,
advantageous
or
disadvantageous,
you're
stuck
with
it.
and
in
the
bremen
case,
maybe
it's
tough
on
zapata
or
bremen,
the
owners
of
the
drilling
rig
to
go
to
lloyd's
and
arbitrate
it,
but
they
agree
to
it.
in
this
case,
i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
meant
when
they
said
it
was
not
bargained
for
and
was
unreasonable
was
that
because
it's
not
bargained
for,
we
can
look
at
it
and
say,
is
this
reasonable?
this
is
imposed
on
my
clients.
they
didn't
get
the
chance
to
look
at
this
thing
over.
you
don't
get
to
look
at
this
ticket
until
it
shows
up,
until
you
pay
your
money.
and
we
cited
the
carnival
cruise
lines
v.
superior
court
case,
which
is
the
williams
case
counsel
referred
to,
in
which
he
says...
in
which
it's
made
pretty
clear.
a
lot
of
times
you
don't
get
this
ticket
till
you
actually
get
on
the
ship.
so,
if
you're
going
to
impose
this
on
consumers,
it
ought
to
at
least
be
fair.
it
ought
to
at
least
be
reasonable.
and
i
think
it's
a
legitimate
function
of
the
court
to
look
at
these
contract
revisions
in
a
case
like
this
and
for
a
district
court
judge
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
enforce
this
because
it's
very
unreasonable.
now,
there's
also
nothing
here
to
stop
the
petitioners
from
bringing
a
motion
to
transfer
this
case
to
miami
if
they
think
that
they
can
win
it.
in
this
case--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--it
doesn't
specifically
mention
that.
it
further
doesn't
specifically
mention
any
kind
of
clause
at
all.
it
just
says
you
can't
use
these
ticket
provisions
to
lessen,
weaken,
or
avoid
the
right
of
a
person
to
get
into
court.
and
there
are
a
couple
of
ways
you
could
read
that.
we
think
the
intent
of
congress
is
to
protect
the
passenger
from
unreasonable
clauses.
and
if
this
case...
if
we
have
to
go
some
place
where
there
are
no
witnesses
and
which
is
3,000
miles
away
from
where
my
client
and
the
witnesses
reside,
it
very
easily
does
lessen,
weaken,
or
avoid
our
attempts.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
most
of
the
fact
witnesses
and
the...
all
the
medical
witnesses
with
the
exception
of
an
unknown
mexican
doctor
are
located
in
the
state
of
washington.
well,
i
should
say
also
the
ship's
doctor...
as
a--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--that's
correct.
some
of
the
cruise
passengers
that
we
know
of
are
in
california.
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
commenced,
the
ship
was
in
california.
we
don't
know
exactly
when,
and...
or
if
it's
still
there
or
not.
i
think
it
may
have
been
moved,
but
at
least
when
we
started
this
lawsuit,
they
were
in
california.
the...
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
ticket
in
this
case
had
said,
you
may
sue
us
in
miami
or
at
the
point
of
embarkation,
it
would
be
a
reasonable
ticket.
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
no
matter
where
you're
hurt,
you
have
to
go
to
miami
to
sue
us.
in
this
case,
if
we
were...
assume
mrs.
shute
was
from
los
angeles,
had
bought
her
ticket
in
los
angeles,
had
boarded
the
vessel
on
long
beach
harbor,
had
walked
out
the
gangplank
and
had
slipped
in
the
aisle
going
to
her
stateroom,
before
the
vessel
ever
left
the
dock,
and
was
injured,
she
would
then...
according
to
the
petitioner's
position
you
have
to
go
to
miami
to
sue
her,
to
bring
her
action
under
this.
and
we
think
that
is
fatally
unreasonable
and
although
i
didn't
address
the
statutes
specifically,
justice
scalia
brought
it
up
and
it's
my
feeling
that
the
statute
is
intended
to
prevent
this
sort
of
thing,
although
the
ninth
circuit
never
got
that
far.
but
i
think
this
court
could
very
easily
rule
on
that
basis.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
our
position
is
that
it
should
be
applied
to
this
case
and
to
persons
in
a
similar
class.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
it
does,
because
if
you're
in
california
they
get
the
same
clause
and
they
have
to
go
to
miami.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
mean
to
restrict
it
to
just
this
case,
but
i
think...
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
we
don't
feel
that
a
forum
selection
clause
was
outlawed
by
congress
per
se
or
that
they're
invalid
per
se,
because
i
think
they
do
have
a
reasonable
commercial
purpose.
i
think
the
example
counsel
cited
is
a
little
weak,
because
there
are
multidistrict
litigation
rules
in
the
civil
rules
for
federal
procedure...
or
federal
rules
for
civil
procedure
which
allow
the
handling
of
plane
crashes
and
multi-district
kind
of
things.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
in
that
case,
i
think
state
law
because
it
probably
is
a
procedural
matter,
would
control
whether
or
not
this
is
to
be
enforced.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
unless
it
was
removed
under...
because
it's
an
admiralty
action
and
i
will
confess,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
not
all
admiralty
actions
are
removable
and
i
don't
know
if
this
one
is
or
not.
i
know
jones
act
actions
by
crew
members
are
not
removable
unless
there's
diversity.
but
it
poses
a
problem
with
the
forum
selection
clause
and
one
reason
why
it's
somewhat
unworkable
and
unfair
to
my
clients.
this
case
is
one
in
which
the
court
has
the
opportunity
to
essentially
leave
the
in
personam
jurisdiction
alone
and
let
specific
jurisdiction
operate
according
to,
i
think,
it's
probably
the
minimum
requirements
which
is
the
but
for
standard
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
by
the
washington
supreme
court.
or
it
can
add
an
additional
requirement
that
the
claim
itself
be
identical
to
the
claim...
to
the
contacts
with
the
state.
and
i
think
that
is
an
additional
requirement,
the
substantive
relevance.
and
if
it
is
adopted,
it
will
essentially
delay
these
cases
one
more
time
and
give
us
much
more
to
litigate
about.
the
court
also
in
our
view
should,
at
least
in
this
case,
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
and
refuse
to
enforce
the
forum
selection
clause.
the
forum
selection
clause,
as
the
william
case
illustrates,
is
an
important
point
across
the
country,
because
there
are
many
litigants
that
want
to
sue
either
where
they
sailed
on
the
ship
or
in
their
home
states.
and
many
times
the
only
thing
preventing
them
is
the
forum
selection
clause.
it
is
unreasonable
in
this
case,
and
it
is
depriving
consumers
of
something
that
they
ought
to
have,
a
right
to
sue
for
injuries
when
they
are
injured
on
board
the
claimant's...
the
petitioner's
vessels.
if
that
is
removed,
then
they
have
to
go
to
miami,
the
practical
effect
is
that
it
will
lessen,
weaken,
or
avoid
their
right
to
recover
from--
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
--in
a
word,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
no,
because
the
question
here
is
not
whether
it
has
been
reasonably
communicated
to
them
or
whether
they
knew
about
it.
the
question
is...
because...
or
if...
well,
let
me
rephrase
that.
mr.
gregory
j.
wall
if
my
client
had
bargained
for
this
and
said,
yes,
i
agree
to
that
specifically,
then
i
would
agree
with
justice
scalia.
however,
if
it's
going
to
be
imposed
upon
them
and
every
other
cruise
line
does
the
same
thing,
then,
no,
i
think
we're
back
to
determining
whether
it
is
reasonable
because
it
is
imposed
upon
them.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
