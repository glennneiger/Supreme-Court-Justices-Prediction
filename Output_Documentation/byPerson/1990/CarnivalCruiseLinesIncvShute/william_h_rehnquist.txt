chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
next
in
argument
no.
89-1647,
carnival
cruise
lines,
inc.,
v.
eulala
shute.
mr.
willard?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
didn't
the
cruise
ship
operate
out
of
los
angeles
though?
i
mean,
might
there
not
have
been
sufficient
jurisdiction
in
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county
or
the
central
district
of
california?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
a
federal
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
willard.
mr.
wall,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
her
affidavit
indicate
that
she
did?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now
the
bremen
didn't
put
it
that
way.
the
bremen
in
a
footnote
said
there's
no
indication
here,
isn't
that
right?
they
didn't
say
unless.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
would
draw
a
negative
implication
from
the
language
of
the
bremen?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
are
these...
the
witnesses
in
your
particular
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
were
fellow
cruise
passengers?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
your
clients
had
filed
in
the
superior
court
of
king
county?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
mean
there
certainly
couldn't
be
any
transfer
to
florida.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wall.
mr.
willard,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
9
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
willard.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1647,
carnival
cruise
lines
versus
shute
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
