justice
kennedy
the
complaint
alleges
negligence,
does
it
not?
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
necessary
for
the
cause
of
action,
but
the
complaint
alleged
negligence.
if
the
plaintiff
here
were...
had
shown
that
she
relied
on
the
advertising
to
find
the
safe
and
reliable
ship
line,
could
you
say
that
there's
some
connection
between
the
negligence
cause
of
action
and
the
advertising
that
she
saw?
i
recognize
that
those
aren't
shown
in
the
case,
but
just
to
test
whether
or
not
it's
arising
out
of
or
related
to.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
context...
do
the
context
have
to
be
necessary
to
the
cause
of
action
under
your
test?
it
has
to
be
related
to
i
thought
our
cases
say.
justice
kennedy
now,
did
you
argue
general
jurisdiction
at
any
point?
justice
kennedy
well,
do
we
look
at
the
forum
selection
clause
from
its
overall
fairness
standpoint,
just
kind
of
a
facial
attack
or
do
we
look
at
it
with
reference
to
the
reasonableness
of
its
application
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
the
california
example
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
analysis
might
be
different.
