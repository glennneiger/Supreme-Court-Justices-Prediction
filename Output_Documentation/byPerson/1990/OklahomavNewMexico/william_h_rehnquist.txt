chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
109
original,
oklahoma
and
texas
v.
new
mexico.
ms.
matthews.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now
that
was
one
of
the
reasons,
though,
that
the
master
construed
the
compact
the
way
he
did,
as
i
understand,
was
the
difficulty
of
measuring
the
amount
of
water
stored
below
conchas
that
had
originated
above
conchas.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
lower
basin
you
mean
below
ute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
below
conchas?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
there
are
some
tributaries
that
arise
below
conchas
but
above
ute
that
are
not
dammed
up
by
ute,
that
flow
into
the
river
below
ute?
no.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
the
lower
basin?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
well
then
go
ahead
and
finish
your
statement.
chief
justice
rehnquist
right.
so
the
only
water
you're
talking
about
is
the
overflow
from
conchas
in
flood
times?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
was
originally
a
contention
by
texas
and
new
mexico,
was
there
not,
that
the
200,000
limitation
applied
to
the
structure
and
not
to
the
amount
of
water?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
oklahoma
has
accepted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
a
strict
constructionist
as
to
the
first
clause
of
part
(b)
and
a
liberal
constructionist
as
to
the
second
clause.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
matthews.
mr.
elliott,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
their
position
on
that
part
was
more
that
the
compact
just
wasn't,
made
no
attempt
to
apportion
anything
to
colorado,
that
was
to
go
to,
ought
to
go
to
colorado.
it's
just
like
a
three-party
lawsuit
that
you're
carving
up
something,
there's
a
fourth
party,
you
can't
bind
the
rights
of
the
fourth
party.
chief
justice
rehnquist
tucumcari
is
located
in
what's
called
the
lower
basin,
below
conchas?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
city
in
texas
is
the
furthest
away
from
the
dam
of
the
11
cities
that
get
the
water,
in
order
of
magnitude?
does
it
go
down
to
lubbock?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you're
talking
about
a
couple
hundred
miles
possibly?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
many
miles
does
the
river
travel
between
conchas
and
ute,
approximately?
chief
justice
rehnquist
river
miles.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
elliott.
mr.
lay,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
doesn't
use
the
word
capacity.
ii(d),
the
term
conservation
means
that
portion
of
the
capacity
of
reservoirs.
you
say
it's
just
like
it
said
reservoir's
capacity.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wouldn't
that
present
some
very
difficult
problems
of
measurement,
if
you
have
all
those
different
kinds
of
storage
behind
the
same
dam
undifferentiated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
oklahoma's
position
is
not
that
its
interpretation
limits
the
size
of
the
structure?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
can
you
say
that
any
one
part
of
a
structure
like
a
dam
relates
to
conservation
storage?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
109,
original
oklahoma
against
new
mexico
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
