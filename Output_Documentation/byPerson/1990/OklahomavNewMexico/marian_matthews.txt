ms.
marian
matthews
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
original
proceeding
involving
the
states
of
new
mexico,
texas,
and
oklahoma,
and
it
involves
the
canadian
river
compact,
a
compact
negotiated
and
signed
by
the
parties
in
1950
and
adopted
by
congress
in
1952.
new
mexico
takes
exception
to
part
vii
of
the
special
master's
report.
the
issue
is
whether
under
the
compact
new
mexico
is
entitled
to
unrestricted
storage
of
all
waters
of
the
canadian
river
originating
above
conchas
dam.
new
mexico
submits
that
it
is
entitled
to
such
storage,
unrestricted
either
as
to
quantity
or
as
to
place
under
the
terms
of
the
compact.
the
canadian
river
rises
in
northeast
new
mexico
and
it
flows
through
the
panhandle
of
texas
eventually
over
into
oklahoma.
there
are
three
dams
along
the
way
which
are
of
interest
in
this
litigation.
the
first,
in
new
mexico,
is
the
conchas
dam,
built
in
1939,
11
years
before
the
compact
was
ever
signed.
65
river
miles
further
east
is
ute
dam,
or
ute
reservoir,
which
is
also
located
in
the
state
of
new
mexico,
and
was
built
in
1963.
and
then
another
165
river
miles
further
east
is
lake
meredith,
which
is
located
north
of
amarillo,
texas,
and
was
built
in
1964.
there
are
two
provisions
of
the
compact
which
are
at
issue
in
this
litigation
to
the
extent
that
new
mexico
takes
exception
with
the
master's
report.
we
believe
that
the
language
of
those
two
provisions
is
critical.
the
compact
itself
is
set
forth
as
an
appendix
either
to
the
special
master's
report
or
to
new
mexico's
brief.
ms.
marian
matthews
yes.
it's
appendix
a
to
new
mexico...
excuse
me,
appendix
a
to
new
mexico's
brief,
your
honor.
and
specifically,
the
part
that
i'm
going
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
is
on
page
2a.
it
is
article
iv(a)
and
article
iv(b).
article
iv(a)
gives
new
mexico
free
and
unrestricted
use
of
all
waters
originating
in
the
drainage
basin
on
the
canadian
river
above
the
conchas
dam.
and
article
iv(b)
gives
new
mexico
free
and
unrestricted
use
of
all
waters
originating
below
the
conchas
dam,
subject
to
a
200,000
acre-foot
conservation
storage
limitation
on
waters
originating
below
conchas.
the
dispute
in
reference
to
article
iv
and
what
it
means
arose
about
a
year
and
a
half
after
this
litigation
originally
began.
initially
texas
and
oklahoma
had
sued
the
state
of
new
mexico,
claiming
that
the
size
of
ute
reservoir,
which
was
enlarged
in
1984,
violated
article
iv(b)
and
article
ii(d)
of
the
compact.
the
master
has
resolved
that
issue
in
favor
of
new
mexico.
article
iv(a)
and
(b)
became
a
major
focus
after
conchas
began
to
spill
in
the
spring
of
1987.
it
was
the
first
major
spill
of
the
conchas
dam
since
approximately
1941-42,
which
of
course
predates
the
compact.
being
a
spill,
the
water
flowed
over
conchas
and
downstream
into
ute
reservoir,
and
approximately
100,000
acre-feet
of
that
water,
about
40
percent
of
the
spill,
was
either
released
or
went
ahead
and
spilled
into
texas,
presumably
most
of
it
flowing
on
to
lake
meredith.
new
mexico
caught
about
60
percent
of
those
conchas
spill
waters
at
the
ute
reservoir,
and
it
did
not
count
those
spill
waters
against
its
200,000
acre-foot
limitation
on
below
conchas
waters,
and
the
reason
was
because
the
spill
came
from
waters
originating
above
conchas,
and
under
article
iv(a)
there
was
no
restriction
on
how
much
water
new
mexico
got
to
store
if
it
originated
above
conchas.
ms.
marian
matthews
that's
precisely
right,
your
honor.
ms.
marian
matthews
that's
right.
and
in
fact
the
parties
and
the
master
in
his
report
agree
that
there
is
absolutely
no
restriction
on
how
big
new
mexico
could
build
ute,
i'm
sorry,
conchas
dam
and
capture
every
drop
of
water
that
might
ever
be
generated
in
the
upper
basin.
so
the
issue
became
whether
or
not
it
makes
a
difference
whether
or
not
new
mexico
chose
instead
of
enlarging
conchas
to
enlarge
ute,
and
does
it
make
a
difference
now
that
we
catch
the
water
of
the
spills
downstream
versus
upstream
behind
the
conchas
dam.
the
result
of
catching
the
spills
in
the
ute
reservoir
in
1987
was
that
as
a
result
ute
reservoir
exceeded
200,000
acre-feet
of
storage.
and
in
december
of
1988
texas
and
oklahoma
filed
a
supplemental
complaint
claiming
that
new
mexico
was
in
violation
of
article
iv(b)'s
storage
limitation
because
we
had
more
than,
at
least
they
claimed
we
had
more
than
200,000
acre-feet
of
water
in
ute
reservoir.
ms.
marian
matthews
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
our
point.
the
master
agreed
with
texas
and
oklahoma,
and
he
decided
in
effect
that
if
new
mexico
chose
to
store
its
water
originating
above
conchas,
if
new
mexico
chose
to
store
that
in
the
downstream
reservoir
at
ute,
then
that
water
became
subject
to
the
200,000
acre-foot
limitation
on
water
originating
below
conchas.
it
became
subject
to
article
iv(b)
of
the
compact.
ms.
marian
matthews
yes,
your
honor.
the
focus
is
not
on
the
molecules
of
water.
obviously
there
is
no
particular
distinction
in
the
quality
of
the
water
above
and
below
conchas.
but
from
an
engineering
standpoint,
using
a
doctrine
called
the
doctrine
of
exchange,
which
i
am
not
an
engineer
and
i
cannot
explain
in
any
detail
to
the
court,
but
using
that
doctrine
you
analogize
the
water
to
blocks
of
water,
and
it's
done
in
other
compacts;
the
pecos
compact,
the
rio
grande
compact,
and
so
forth.
and
so
it's
possible,
using
gauges
and
engineering
calculations
and
computer
models
and
so
forth
to
determine
with
some
accuracy
how
much
of
the
water
in
ute
originated
above
conchas.
ms.
marian
matthews
the
master
had
concern
about
whether
the
alleged
difficulty
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
goal
of
the
negotiators
to
have
a
simple
compact.
but
we
would
suggest
first
of
all
that
there
is
no
evidentiary
showing
at
this
point
in
this
case
that
it
is
a
difficult
calculation.
my
understanding
from
our
engineers
is
that
it
is
not
a
difficult
calculation.
secondly,
article
v(c),
which
relates
to
texas'
rights
relative
to
oklahoma,
clearly
requires
a
fairly
complex
calculation
not
unlike
that
which
would
be
required
to
determine
above
conchas
water
from
below
conchas
water.
third,
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
a
good
test
of
contract
interpretation
to
decide
that
because
it
requires
some
engineering
calculations
that
we're
going
to
change
and
rewrite
the
meaning
of
the
compact
between
three
sovereign
states;
certainly
not
without,
not
with
the
evidentiary
basis
that's
in
the
record
at
this
point
in
this
case.
ms.
marian
matthews
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
the
geography
here
is
very
interesting
and
it
supports
the
upper
and
lower
basin
distinction.
ms.
marian
matthews
well,
in
fact
there
are
no
tributaries
above
conchas
that
flow
into
ute.
the
tributaries
above
conchas
flow
into
conchas
or
the
canadian
river
above
conchas.
ms.
marian
matthews
that's
my
understanding
of
the
geography.
there
is
a
map
attached
to
the
master's
report,
the
appendix,
and
it's
not...
it's
a
little
difficult
to
read.
ms.
marian
matthews
yes.
the
watershed
essentially
fairly
well
geographically
breaks
into
three
parts.
there
is
above
conchas.
conchas
is
fed
by
tributaries
above
conchas
and
the
canadian
river
that
flows
above
conchas.
ms.
marian
matthews
and
then
you
go
downstream
to
ute,
and
ute
is
fed
by
pajarito
creek
and
ute
creek,
both
of
which
come
in
below
conchas.
ms.
marian
matthews
yes.
they
flow
either--
ms.
marian
matthews
--no.
ute
creek,
i
think,
flows
about
3
miles
from
where
the
reservoir
actually
starts.
but
they
do
flow
in
below
conchas.
ms.
marian
matthews
yes.
they're
in
the
lower
basin.
and
then
in
that
lower
basin
there
are
a
number
of
other
creeks
and
waterways,
most
of
which,
or
a
number
of
which
rise
in
new
mexico,
which
flow
then
into
lake
meredith
in
texas.
ms.
marian
matthews
below
conchas.
ms.
marian
matthews
yes.
ms.
marian
matthews
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
accurate.
there
are
tributaries
which
arise
below
conchas
which
flow
into
ute.
ms.
marian
matthews
there
are
additional
tributaries
in
the
lower
basin
which
do
not
flow
into
ute,
which
flow--
ms.
marian
matthews
--below
conchas.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
marian
matthews
okay.
there
are
certain
tributaries
which
flow
into
ute.
and
then
also
in
the
lower
basin
there
are
tributaries
which,
some
of
which
flow
into
the
canadian
river
below
ute
and
then
on
to
lake
meredith,
some
of
which
rise
in
other
parts
of
the
state,
flow
into
texas
and
eventually
flow
into
meredith,
either
hooking
up
with
the
canadian
river
or
other
tributaries.
ms.
marian
matthews
as
a
practical
matter.
we're
talking
about
the
spills
from
conchas
dam
that
arise
above
conchas
dam.
it
is
new
mexico's
position
in
this
litigation
that
its
storage
rights
of,
and
its
use
rights
of
above
conchas
water
are
unrestricted
as
to
either
quantity
or
location
for
three
reasons.
first,
because
that's
what
the
unambiguous
language
of
the
compact
says.
secondly,
that
language
is
consistent
with
the
geography
of
the
area,
as
we
have
just
discussed,
and
with
the
historical
context
of
the
compact.
and
third,
any
other
conclusion
simply
leads
us
to
some
very
illogical
results.
i'd
like
to
look
first
at
the
question
of
language.
as
i
indicated,
under
iv(a)
there
is
no
restriction
of
any
kind
on
new
mexico's
rights
to
water
originating
above
conchas.
and
as
i
indicated
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question
a
minute
ago,
new
mexico
can,
and
the
parties
and
the
special
master
all
acknowledge
that
new
mexico
can
make
conchas
as
big
as
it
wants
to
make
it.
so
there
is
clearly
no
restriction.
ms.
marian
matthews
texas
and
oklahoma
originally
sued
new
mexico
claiming
that
the
fact
that
new
mexico
had
enlarged
ute
to
be,
to
have
a
gross
physical
capacity
of
more
than
200,000
acre-feet
was
in
itself
a
violation
of
the
compact
regardless
of
how
much
water
we
actually
stored
in
it.
ms.
marian
matthews
now
that
was
resolved
against
texas
and
oklahoma
by
the
special
master,
and
my
understanding
today
is
that
only
oklahoma
still
maintains
that
position
and
took
exception
to
that
part
of
the
report.
ms.
marian
matthews
yes,
oklahoma
has.
under
iv(b)
of
the
compact,
again
as
i
indicated,
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
use
of
the
waters
below
conchas,
but
there
is
this
200,000
acre-foot
limitation
of
the
storage
of
the
waters
originating
below
conchas.
and
that
is
specifically
what
the
language
of
iv(b)
says.
from
the
standpoint
of
contract
law,
from
the
standpoint
of
statutory
interpretation,
because
we
are
here
dealing
with
both
a
contract
and
an
act
of
congress,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
language
of
iv(a)
and
iv(b)
has
to
control
unless
it
is
somehow
ambiguous.
the
report
found
that
there
is
ambiguity
in
part
because
it
was
unclear
what
the
rights
were
between
new
mexico
and
colorado
under
iv(a).
we
question
whether
there
is
a
true
ambiguity
in
reading
iv(a)
that
way,
but
even
if
it
is,
colorado
is
not
a
party
to
the
compact.
colorado
is
not
a
party
to
this
litigation.
it
is
at
best
an
irrelevant
ambiguity.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
would
be
very
bad
precedent
to
rewrite
compacts
between
sovereign
states
based
upon
alleged
ambiguities
which
are
unrelated
to
the
dispute
that
has
arisen
among
the
parties.
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
language
of
iv(a)
and
iv(b),
and
no
one
has
suggested
a
reasonable
alternative
meaning
to
the
plain
language
of
those,
of
that
portion
of
the
compact.
as
i
indicated,
we
feel
that
the
distinction
between
article
iv(a)
and
iv(b),
and
i
by
shorthand
refer
to
it
as
upper
basin
and
lower
basin,
has
a
geographical,
has
a
geographical
basis,
and
that
the
basins
fall,
in
the
way
they
are
fed
and
the
way
the
dams
are
fed,
makes
sense
within
the
context
of
the
compact
and
gives
meaning
to
the
distinction
made
between
iv(a)
and
iv(b).
we
have
talked
about
that
some.
i'd
like
to
move
now
to
the
question
of
the
historical
context
of
this
compact
and
how
it
is
consistent
also
with
new
mexico's
reading
of
iv(a)
and
iv(b).
in
1950
texas
wanted
federal
money
to
build
the
sanford
project,
which
later
became
lake
meredith.
new
mexico
had
some
powerful
senators
at
the
time,
senator
anderson
and
senator
javis,
and
they
said
no,
texas,
we're
not
going
to
permit
you
to
get
the
funding
for
the
sanford
project
until
and
unless
there
is
a
compact
which
protects
the
rights
of
new
mexice
in
the
waters
of
the
canadian
river
basin.
and
in
fact
the
legislation
which
authorized
sanford
project
was
contingent
upon
approval
of
the
compact
being
negotiated
and
being
approved
by
congress.
the
parties
sat
down
in
1950
over
roughly
a
6-month
period,
and
they
negotiated
the
canadian
river
basin
compact.
as
a
result
of
those
negotiations
new
mexico
received
two
things.
new
mexico
received
the
right
to
all
the
waters
above
conchas
without
restriction.
now
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
here
that
prior
to
that
time
the
waters
above
conchas
had
been
fully
developed,
so
that
new
mexico,
under
equitable
doctrines
of
water
law,
was
entitled
to
those
rights
anyway.
and
the
only
issue
above
conchas
was
the
spill
water.
but
as
part
of
the
negotiating
process
texas
and
oklahoma
agreed,
new
mexico,
you
will
have
all
the
waters
above
conchas.
and
then
the
second
thing
that
new
mexico
received
was
protection
for
its
as
yet
undeveloped
rights
below
conchas
up
to
the
200,000
acre-feet.
this
was
important
because
at
that
time,
though
there
were
a
few
uses,
below
conchas
waters
had
really
not
been
appropriated
by
anyone.
and
if
texas
built
lake
meredith
and
there
had
not
been
a
compact,
what
eventually
would
have
happened
is
that
texas,
under
the
doctrine
of
priority,
or
prior
appropriation,
would
end
up
with
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin.
new
mexico,
of
course,
would
have
had
the
upper
waters,
the
waters
above
conchas,
because
it
had
already
established
rights
in
those.
and
so
what
the
parties
did
was
agree
that
new
mexico
could
have
up
to
200,000
acre-feet
of
those
waters
which
originate
below
conchas
so
that
in
the
future
at
some
time
it
could
do
the
development
that
it
wanted
to.
ms.
marian
matthews
that
was
at
the
time
of,
for
below
conchas,
yes.
ms.
marian
matthews
well,
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
practical
matter
what
is
happening
out
in
that
part
of
the
country
is
the
ogallala
aquifer--
ms.
marian
matthews
--it's
drying
up.
and
the
predictions
made
in
1950,
that's
over
41
years
ago,
and
there
is
potentially
some
very
serious
water
problems
out
there.
ms.
marian
matthews
yes.
we
believe
that
we
can.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
we
are
not
now
at
this
point
using
that
in
our
communities
in
that
area.
we
have
plans
to
do
so.
we
have,
projections
are
being
made,
option
contracts
have
been
signed.
it
is
not
now
being
used,
and
i
don't
want
to
leave
that
impression
with
the
court.
as
a
result
of
the
compact,
new
mexico
got--
ms.
marian
matthews
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
new
mexico
got
the
right
to
all
the
waters
above
conchas
and
we
got
the
200,000
acre-feet
below
conchas.
texas
received
$90
million
in
funding
for
the
sanford
project.
it
received
all
waters
of
the
lower
basin
except
the
200,000
acre-feet,
and
subject
to
the
restrictions
that
it
has
in
terms
of
oklahoma.
and
that
is
and
was
a
significant
amount
of
water,
and
that
does
provide
the
water,
a
substantial
portion
of
the
water
that
supplies
lake
meredith.
articles
iv(a)
and
iv(5),
we
submit,
simply
represent
the
deal
that
was
made
by
three
sovereign
states
in
santa
fe,
new
mexico
on
december
6,
1950.
the
last
thing
i'd
like
to
talk
about
briefly--
ms.
marian
matthews
--i
don't
believe
it's
a
different
thing
than
saying--
ms.
marian
matthews
--i'm
not
sure
we
disagree.
i
read
this
to
say
that
we
can
store
200,000
acre-feet.
ms.
marian
matthews
well,
this
is
the
point
that
oklahoma--
ms.
marian
matthews
--and
texas
had
raised.
i
see.
ms.
marian
matthews
no,
i'd
be
happy
to
get
to
that
now.
i
think
that
the,
if
you
read
the
entire
compact
and
you
read
all
the
articles
of
the
compact
it
becomes
clear
that
what
that
language
is
talking
about
there
is
the
portion
of
the
reservoir
that
is
available
for
this
storage.
the
definition
of
conservation
storage
includes
a
number
of
uses,
some
of
which
are
not
subject
to
the
200,000
storage
limitation.
so
clearly
it
was
anticipated
that
the
reservoirs
would
be
larger
than
200,000
acre-feet.
it's
also
just
physically
impossible
to
build
a
reservoir
at
a
precise
acre-footage.
ms.
marian
matthews
well,
i
don't
like
to
look
at
it
that
way,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
think--
ms.
marian
matthews
--except
in
reverse.
except
what
the
special
master
did,
and
it
did
seem
like
an
appropriate
analysis,
he
looked
at
the
four
corners
of
the
compact.
in
reading
the
four
corners
of
the
compact
he
determined
that
it,
clearly
the
storage
limitation
related
to
quantities
of
water,
not
sizes
of
reservoirs.
i
think
that's
a
somewhat
different
thing
than
what
he
did
in
rewriting
iv(a),
which
was
go
outside
the
four
corners
of
the
document
and
use
other
sorts
of
sources
and
other
sorts
of
concerns
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
he
wanted
to
reach.
ms.
marian
matthews
yes.
ms.
marian
matthews
no.
well,
we
think
it's
real
possible
under
the
doctrine
of
exchange.
ms.
marian
matthews
oh,
you're
asking
if
we
build
a
second
reservoir?
ms.
marian
matthews
i
think
i
do,
too.
yes.
i
think
i
would
still
maintain
that
position.
ms.
marian
matthews
well,
from
an
economic
and
a
practical
standpoint
it
does
not
make
sense,
and
that's
part
of
the
problem
here,
is
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
downstream--
ms.
marian
matthews
--well,
in
effect
that's
what
the
master
said.
we
could
make
conchas
or
anything
above
conchas
as
big
as
we
wanted,
but
once
it
passed
over
the
dam--
ms.
marian
matthews
--i
guess
i'm
not
following
your
question,
your
honor.
ms.
marian
matthews
right.
ms.
marian
matthews
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
argument
that
texas
and
oklahoma
made.
conceivably
new
mexico
could
make
that
argument,
sure.
we
could
build
the
dam
downriver
from
conchas
and
say
we're
not
going
to
put
any
below
water
in
it
except
spills
that
originate
above.
we
could
conceivably
make
that
argument
under
the
compact,
yes.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
mean,
that's
just
economic
insanity.
we
can't
build
dams
to
hold
spills
which
occur
once
every
40
years.
ms.
marian
matthews
i'm
sorry?
ms.
marian
matthews
well,
if
you
read
the,
if
you
read
that
as
a
restriction
on
the
size
of
the
reservoir
that
would
be
correct.
but
we
would
think
that's
an
incorrect
reading
of
that
provision,
that
that
refers
to
the
portion
of
capacity
of
the
reservoir,
not
the
finite
capacity
of
the
reservoir.
ms.
marian
matthews
well,
your
honor,
the
difficulty
with
that
is
the
size
of
reservoirs
changes
all
the
time
because
of
sediment,
and
that
would
put
us
in
the
position
of
every
time
there's
a
foot
of
sediment
added
to
the
floor
of
the
reservoir
of
having
to
go
out
with
our
brick
and
mortar
and
add
a
foot
of
capacity
above
it.
that's
not
how
dams
are
built.
at
least
it's
not
how
they're
built
in
new
mexico.
ms.
marian
matthews
that's
a
very
expensive
project.
it
cost
us
$14
million
to
increase
the
size
of
ute
in
1984.
i
mean,
that's
a
very
expensive
project.
i
don't
believe
that's
what
they
intended.
that's
not
the
way
dams
are
built.
they're
built
with
the
idea
that
sediment
will
fill
them,
and
that
the
capacity
has
to
be
large
enough
to
take
care
of
that
use.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
