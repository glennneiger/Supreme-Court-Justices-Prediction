mr.
paul
elliott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
texas
and
oklahoma
are
asking
this
court
to
adopt
part
vii
of
the
special
master's
recommendation
on
the
above
conchas
water
issue.
in
our
view
the
interpretation
that
new
mexico
is
making
of
the
compact
would
destroy
the
equitable
apportionment
that
the
states
bargained
for
and
is
provided
by
the
language
of
the
compact.
in
1987
in
response--
mr.
paul
elliott
--no,
it
does
not.
it's
in
the
congressional
statute.
mr.
paul
elliott
yes,
sir,
it
is.
in
this
case
congress
said
that
when
it
ratified
the
compact,
but
it's
not
in
the
words
of
the
compact
itself.
in
1987
in
response
to
this
lawsuit
for
the
first
time
new
mexico
interpreted
the
word
originating
in
article
iv(b)
differently
and
in
direct
conflict
with
the
way
that
it
was
interpreting
the
same
term
in
article
iv(a).
and
i'd
like
to
mention
in
terms
of
the
lawsuit
i
disagree
with,
respectfully,
with
my
opposing
counsel.
this
lawsuit
was
not
filed
over
the
capacity
versus
water
and
storage
issue,
but
was
filed
because
new
mexico
was
claiming
that
it
could
store
unlimited
amounts
of
water
for
recreational
purposes,
and
was
in
fact
attempting
to
exempt
part
of
the
storage
of
ute
reservoir
for
that
recreation
purpose.
this
is
set
out
in
the
special
master's
report
on
pages
18
to
22.
new
mexico
interpreted
article
iv(a)
in
a
totally
ambiguous
and,
inherently
ambiguous
and
unnecessarily
ambiguous
way
from
the
way
it
interpreted
article
iv(b).
article
iv(a)
sets
out
new
mexico's
entitlement
above
conchas
dam.
new
mexico
says
that
the
word
originating
as
it
appears
in
article
iv(a)
does
not
mean
just
arising.
it
includes...
it
does
not
just
mean
waters
arising
in
new
mexico,
but
includes
waters
that
enter
into
new
mexico
from
tributaries
in
colorado.
mr.
paul
elliott
well,
that's
actually,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
different
interpretation.
the
compact
just
says
waters
originating
above
conchas
dam.
and
under
that
interpretation
it
could
be
argued
that
new
mexico
had
a
claim
then
to
waters
in
colorado,
since
they
do
in
fact
originate
above
conchas.
that
would
be
perhaps
the
most
literal
interpretation.
new
mexico
says
that
that's
not
correct
because
the
compact
gives
them
waters
above
conchas
dam
in
new
mexico.
but
if
you
look
at
waters
originating
in
new
mexico,
they
would
not
include,
under
an
arising
interpretation
of
the
word
originating,
they
would
not
include
those
waters
that
enter
into
the
state
from
above.
that
is
the
same
interpretation
that
we...
we
have
no
problem
with
that
interpretation.
we
think
that's
correct.
we
think
that
the
way
the
term
is
used
in
the
compact,
that
originating
means
waters
not
only
arising
but
also
entering
into
that
portion
of
the
basin.
we
only
ask
that
that
same
identical
interpretation
also
be
applied
to
the
term
originating
in
article
iv(b).
mr.
paul
elliott
once
it...
yes,
sir.
once
it
enters
into
the
basin,
and,
below
conchas,
we
believe--
mr.
paul
elliott
--once
it
enters
into
the
basin,
that's
correct.
and
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
seepage
from
conchas
every
year,
in
a
normal
year
several
thousand
acre-feet.
that
water
has
always
been
considered
as
waters
originating
below
conchas.
it
is
true
that
the
1987
spill
was
the
largest
spill
since
1942,
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
have
been
several
significant
spills
since
'42,
as
much
as
129,000
acre-feet
in
1944,
spills
in
'48,
'58,
'61,
'65.
these
were
significant
spills
of
tens
of
thousands
of
acre-feet
in
each
of
those
years
that
were
all
accounted
and
all
considered
to
be
waters
originating
below
conchas
dam.
the
other
waters
that
originate
below
conchas
dam
are
the
return
flows
from
the
tucumcari
project.
this
is
a
large
irrigation
project
that
diverts
water
from
behind
conchas
dam
and
brings
it
down
in
a
channel,
and
then
uses
flood
irrigation
to
irrigate
roughly
30,000
acres
each
year.
a
large
percentage
of
that
water,
and
the
exact
amount
is
not
known,
runs
off
and
returns
into
the
canadian
river
below
conchas
dam.
and
again,
under
new
mexico's
theory,
that
water
would
have
to
be
considered
theirs,
their
exclusive
property.
they
have
never
considered
it
so.
it
has
always
been
considered
as
waters
originating
below
conchas,
and
texas
has
been
able
to
use
those
waters
as
well
as
the
other
releases
and
spills
and
seepages
from
conchas
dam
that
new
mexico
is
now
claiming
an
exclusive
right
to.
mr.
paul
elliott
that's
correct.
it's
actually
near
ute
reservoir.
mr.
paul
elliott
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
originating
means
simply
entering,
as
understood
by
the
people
that
wrote
it
and
as,
as
contained
within
the
context
of
the
compact.
mr.
paul
elliott
if
new
mexico
could
enlarge
conchas
dam,
which
they
looked
into
and
found
it
was
economically
infeasible,
that
is
correct,
as
justice
white
asked
earlier.
they
could
in
fact
retain
those
waters.
mr.
paul
elliott
the
waters
at
conchas
dam,
yes,
sir.
they
could
retain
those.
the
compact
negotiators
decided
that
there
was
no
need
to
place
a
limit
on
the
waters
of
conchas
dam
on
additional
storage
of
those
waters
above
conchas
dam
because
they
had
all
been
developed
for
this
tucumcari
project.
mr.
paul
elliott
the
floods
were
infrequent.
when
the
compact
negotiators
allocated
the
waters
among
the
states
they
relied
exclusively
upon
the
technical
studies
of
their
engineer
advisors.
the
engineer
advisors,
in
arriving
at
the
200,000
acre-foot
limitation
on
waters
below
conchas,
did
not
distinguish
in
any
way
as
to
the
source
of
the
waters.
they
routed
all
waters,
the
spills,
the
seepages,
the
return
flows,
everything
was
routed
to
texas
in
excess
of
the
200,000
acre-feet
below
conchas.
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
which
built,
which
planned
and
constructed
the
sanford
project,
which
is
now
called
lake
meredith,
did
exactly
the
same
thing.
they
routed
as
waters
available
for
that
project
all
waters
in
excess
of
200,000
acre-feet
below
conchas.
and
as
i
was
saying
that
there
were
spills
during
the
time
that
the
bureau
and
the
engineer
advisors
were
reviewing
the
floods,
there
were
releases,
there
were
seepages
every
year,
and
substantial
amounts
of
return
flow
from
the
tucumcari
project.
all
of
those
waters
were
treated
as
exactly
the
same.
once
they
entered
into
the
basin,
into
the
watershed
below
conchas,
they
fell
within
the
article
ii(b)
restriction.
mr.
paul
elliott
lake
meredith
is
in
texas.
mr.
paul
elliott
roughly
half.
mr.
paul
elliott
right.
mr.
paul
elliott
there
are
some
fairly
major
tributaries
that
come
in
below
ute.
one
of
those
contains
a
lot
of
that
tucumcari
return
flow.
a
lot
of
the
waters
that
are
in
that
tributary
are
the
return
flows
from
the
tucumcari
project.
mr.
paul
elliott
just
the
canadian
and
tributaries
that
are
below
the
project,
below
ute
and
below
the
texas
state
line.
mr.
paul
elliott
that's
correct.
just
the
canadian
river.
mr.
paul
elliott
the
capacity
is
1,400,000.
it
currently
has
about
300,000
acre-feet
in
it.
it's
never
filled.
there
has
never
been
enough
water
to
supply
the
demand
for
it.
the
authority
that
operates
it
for
the
11
cities
that
take
water
from
the
lake
typically
can
only
allocate
about
80
percent
of
the
request
because
of
the
lack
of
water.
the
water--
mr.
paul
elliott
--lubbock
is
one
of
the
first
cities.
the
largest
cities
are
lubbock
and
amarillo
and
plainview.
there
are
some
smaller
cities--
mr.
paul
elliott
--they
are
serviced
off
a
canal
primarily
that
runs
from
lake
meredith,
it
goes
south
and
then
services
several
cities
as
it
moves
south.
as
i
said,
the
largest
users
are,
are
lubbock
and
amarillo.
lubbock
relies
almost,
well,
predominantly
upon
the
canadian
river.
most
of
the
cities
have
had
to
go
to
some
kind
of
supplemental
source,
in
this
case
the
ogallala
aquifer,
although
there
are
still
a
couple
of
towns
or
cities
that
rely
almost,
or
exclusively
upon
the
canadian
river.
and
of
course
that's
part
of
the
problem,
is
that
new
mexico
is
retaining
this
water
in
storage
now.
they
are
not
using
it.
they
hope
to
be
able
to
use
it
someday
for
this
water
supply
project
that
they
have
had
on
the
drawing
board
since
1972.
it's
no
closer
to
being
a
reality
now
than
it
was
10,
15
years
ago.
and
it
is
definitely,
texas
is
definitely
being
harmed.
these
cities
have
almost
half
a
million
people
in
them,
and--
mr.
paul
elliott
--absolutely
not.
they
can
use
the
spills--
mr.
paul
elliott
--the
floodwaters
in
'87
triggered
this,
and
of
course--
mr.
paul
elliott
--that's
correct,
they
could.
mr.
paul
elliott
well,
as
a
practical
matter
they
found
that
they
can't
do
it.
it's
not
feasible.
the
flood
flows
are
not
frequent
enough
and
in
large
enough
magnitude
to
make
it
economically
feasible,
so
they
have
rejected
that
idea.
they
have
the
legal
right
to
do
it.
mr.
paul
elliott
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
elliott
no.
the
sanford
project
relied
upon
all
waters,
including
floodwaters,
in
excess
of
the
200,000
acre-feet
of
conservation
storage
below
conchas.
they
routed
all
waters
to
texas
for
the
project
and
they
were
available
for
the
project.
mr.
paul
elliott
they
used
the
floodwaters.
the
only
thing
they
didn't
do
was...
the
reservoir
is
operated
as
what
is
called
a
firm
yield,
meaning
what
it
will
supply
in
the
very
driest
year
of
record.
so
they
actually
obtained
funding
based
on
that
year,
and
of
course
there
were
no
spills
in
that
year,
although
there
would
still
be
return
flows
from
the
tucumcari
project
that
would
have
been
entering
texas
and
would
have
been
used,
available
to
the
project.
our
point
here
is
simply
that
it's
not
just
the
spills,
it's
not
just
the
major
infrequent
spills.
it
is
a
constant
supply
of
water
to
texas
every
year.
new
mexico
has
developed
accounting
procedures
for
this
above
conchas
water
that
is
stored
in
ute
that
magnifies
the
exemption
and
at
this
point,
under
their
accounting
procedure,
which
is
hydrologically
impossible,
they
have
determined
that
only
8
percent
of
the
amount
of
water
that
is
stored
in
ute
reservoir
is
actually
subject
to
the
200,000
acre-foot
limitation.
it
would
create
an
enormous
hardship
on
texas
if
new
mexico
were
then
to
start
accounting
for
the
tucumcari
return
flows
which
they
would
have
the
legal
right
to
do,
if
they
could
start
accounting
for
the
seepage--
mr.
paul
elliott
--they
have
claimed
that
they
are
entitled
to
them.
the
waters
have
never
been
measured,
and
as
a
practical
matter
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
measure.
and
i
can--
mr.
paul
elliott
--well,
and
there
would
certainly
be
a
battle
over
it
because
it
would
be
extremely
subjective.
mr.
paul
elliott
that's
what
this
fight
is
over.
but
it
has
the
legal
ramifications
far
beyond
that,
far
beyond
it,
including
the,
just
the
several
thousand
acre-feet
that
seep
from
conchas
dam
every
year
into
the
lower
basin.
it's,
the
accounting
procedures
are...
i
again
have
to
disagree
with
my
opposing
counsel.
we
believe
they're
very
complex.
they're
set
out
in
the
master,
in
the
agreed
facts
at
b-38,
and
i
would
invite
the
court's
appearance
to
look
at
that.
but
they
include
things
like
having
to
make
determinations
on
evaporation,
on
seepages,
on
diversions,
on
return
flows.
we
feel
like
those
accounting
procedures
for
water
stored
below
conchas
would
be
extremely
complex,
and
there
would
be
much
controversy
and
disagreement
among
the
states
over
the
results
of
those
procedures.
and
this
is
certainly
not
what
was
intended
by
the
compact.
the
compact
was
said
to
be,
by
the
people
who
wrote
it,
to
be
virtually
self-executing
and
require
minimal
administration.
this
would
require
in
effect
the--
mr.
paul
elliott
--in
1972
the
gauge
below
conchas
was
discontinued,
and
there
really
is
not
any
flow
measurement
of
the
water
below
conchas.
mr.
paul
elliott
there
could
be
a
new
gauge
installed,
i
suppose.
mr.
paul
elliott
the
gauge
itself
would
not,
no.
mr.
paul
elliott
but
there
would
still
have
to
be
an
accounting
for
what
happened
to
that
water
after
it
passed
the
gauge--
mr.
paul
elliott
--in
terms
of
losses
and
evaporation.
it's
the,
it
would
amount
to
the
kind
of
flow
accounting
that
the
people
who
wrote
this
compact
thought
they
had
avoided
by
this
capacity
or
this
water,
even
waters
and
storage
limitation.
mr.
paul
elliott
in
river
miles--
mr.
paul
elliott
--river
miles?
i
know
it's
over
100,
but
i'm
just
not
sure
how
far
it
is.
and
i
may
be
way
off
on
that.
the
point
on
the
accounting
is
that
we
would
then
be
getting
into
flow
accounting.
we
would
be
getting
into
measurements
of
water
with
gauges
and
getting
into
arguments
over
losses.
this
is
the
kind
of
flow
accounting
that
new
mexico
and
texas
have
been
battling
over
for
years
on
the
pecos
river
compact,
and
it's
exactly
what
the
writers
of
this
compact
tried
to
avoid.
and
indeed
we
think
it's
important
that
that
be
avoided.
it's...
new
mexico
bargained
for
protection
for
all
its
waters
above
conchas,
and
primarily
the
tucumcari
project
and
an
additional
200,000
acre-feet
of
conservation
storage
below
conchas.
we're
satisfied
with
that
bargain,
and
until
1987
new
mexico
was
too.
what
they're
asking
for
now
would
in
effect
be
an
unlimited
allocation.
the
200,000
acre-foot
limitation
would
be
replaced
by
one
that
would
have
no
limit.
it
would
just
be
a
matter
of
every
year
trying
to
account
for
all
these
different
waters
from
the
tucumcari
project
and
from
conchas
that
are
in
the
basin
below
conchas,
and
then
adding
to
that
200,000
acre-feet.
we
feel
like,
that
it
was
extremely
important
to
texas.
we
did
not,
as
was
implied,
bargain
away
in
order
to
get
sanford
dam
our
ability
to
obtain
flows
from
new
mexico
since,
as
i
said
earlier,
about
half
the
flows
that
are
entering,
that
we
get
into
lake
meredith
are
from
new
mexico.
it
was
critical
to
texas
that
there
be
a
defined
limitation
on
new
mexico's
right
to
construct
storage
and
impound
waters
below
conchas.
that
was
critical.
that
was
the
one
thing
we
could
never
have
bargained
away.
mr.
paul
elliott
we
believe
that
there
are
some
practical
implications
of
limiting
the,
their
right
to
a
capacity
limitation.
we
think
that
some
of
that
can
be
overcome
by
creative
means.
you
can
build
a
reservoir
that
is
far
in
excess
and
then
you
would
have
a
sediment
reserve
pool,
for
instance,
that
you
could
use
to
collect
sediment.
again
on
the
capacity
issue,
it
was
texas'
view
that
unlike
the
conchas
issue
it
did
not
destroy
the
equitable
apportionment
that
was
set
out
in
the
compact
and
clearly
intended,
clearly
intended
by
the
negotiators.
but
