justice
o'connor
ms.
matthews,
is
it
practicable
to
measure
how
much
of
the
water
in
the
ute
reservoir
is
from
upper,
above
conchas
drainage
and
how
much
below?
justice
o'connor
well,
floodwaters
which
i
guess
you
concede
they
could
capture
at
least
at
conchas
if
they
increase
that
capacity?
justice
o'connor
so
new
mexico
has
the
right
and
the
means
ultimately
to
keep
all
that
water.
justice
o'connor
right.
but
they
have
the
legal
right
to
do
just
that.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suspect
that
sediment
control
requires
that
the
water
sit
there
and
not
be
released,
and
that's
another
exception
to
the
storage.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
and
not
chargeable
against
the
200,000.
and
in
that
instance
it
isn't
released,
it's
kept
so
that
the
silt
can
settle
out.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
just
said
sediment
control
did
not
require
release.
and
surely
it
doesn't.
justice
o'connor
yes,
you
may.
