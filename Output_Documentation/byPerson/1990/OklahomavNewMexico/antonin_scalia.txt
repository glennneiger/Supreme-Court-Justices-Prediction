justice
scalia
excuse
me,
before
you
get
off
that,
it
really
doesn't
say
that,
though.
it
doesn't
say
that
you
can,
that
you
can
use
200,000
acre-feet
from
the
lower
basin.
it
says,
to
the
contrary,
that
the
amount
of
conservation
storage
available
for
impounding
the
waters
from
that
basin,
the
amount
of
storage
available
for
impounding
those
waters
shall
not
exceed
200,000.
isn't
that
a
quite
different
thing?
justice
scalia
i
mean
if
they
said
you
can
use
200,000
feet,
that
would
be
different.
and
they
could
have
said
that,
but
they
didn't.
justice
scalia
no,
it
doesn't
say
you
can
store
it.
it
said
the
amount
of
conservation
storage
in
new
mexico
available
for
impounding
these
waters
shall
be
limited
to
an
aggregate
of
200,000
acre-feet.
so
if
you
have
a
storage
facility
that
could
impound
more
than
that,
even
if
you're
only
taking
200,000
acre-feet
from
that
basin,
you'd
be
in
violation
of
that
provision
if
the
storage
facility
were
too
large.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
you
don't
want
to
get
to
that
now?
are
you
going
to
get
to
that
later?
justice
scalia
it
wouldn't
serve
any
purpose,
then.
i
mean,
i
read
that
provision
as...
of
course
the
object
was
to
limit
you
to
200,000
acre-feet.
that
was
surely
the
object.
but
the
way
of
arriving
at
that
object
is
to
say
look,
we're
not
going
to
measure
all
the
acre-feet.
how
do
you
measure
them?
there's
no
way
possible
to
measure
them
all.
well,
one
clear
way
to
keep
you
honest
is
to
say
you
can't
build
a
reservoir
any
bigger
than
that,
period.
justice
scalia
under
your
theory
it
has
nothing
to
do
with,
the
compact
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
water
you
get
to
use,
but
simply
with
where
you
ought
to
build
your
reservoirs.
justice
scalia
so
that
new
mexico
doesn't
have
to
let
anything
enter
the
lower
basin?
justice
scalia
mr.
elliott,
how
do
you
respond
to
the
argument
that
you
can't
really
compute
a
capacity
that
precisely,
200,000,
and
also
that
it
keeps
changing
as
it
silts
up,
and
it's
so
exorbitantly
expensive
to
increase
the
capacity
that
it's
not
reasonable
to
think
that
that's
what
they
bargained
about?
justice
scalia
what
if
they
say
okay,
we're
going
to
add
on
another
four
feet
for
recreation?
but
there
is
no
limit
on
how
much
they
can
add
for
recreational
capacity,
right?
justice
scalia
so
you,
so
there's
no
such
thing
as
conservation
storage,
then,
you're
saying,
right?
or
recreation
storage?
it's
just
recreation
use.
there's
no
such
thing
as
recreation
storage.
