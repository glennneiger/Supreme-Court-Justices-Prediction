mr.
r.
thomas
lay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
oklahoma
concurs
with
the
exceptions
which
have
been
taken
and
advanced
by
the
state
of
texas,
and
we
are
here
to
raise
the
additional
exception
relating
to
section
vi
of
the
special
master's
report
wherein
the
special
master
recommends
that
this
court
interpret
article
iv(b)
of
the
compact
to
impose
a
water
in
storage
or
quantity
of
water
limitation
on
new
mexico,
as
opposed
to
a
capacity
limitation.
article
iv(b)
of
the
compact
clearly
states
that
it
is
a
limitation
upon
the
amount
of
conservation
storage
available
for
impounding.
any
question
about
that
referring
to
capacity
and
sounding
in
capacity
is
resolved
by
article
ii(d)
of
the
compact
which
defines
conservation
storage.
it
defines
conservation
storage
as
that
portion
of
the,
that
portions
of
reservoir
capacity
available
for
the
storage
of
water.
one
thing
i
do
wish
to
stress,
i
take--
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
--yes,
your
honor.
in
my
description
i
turned
those
two
words
around.
one
thing
i
do
wish
to
stress,
which
i
had
the
impression
my
honorable
opposing
counsel
was
urging
this
morning,
is
that
oklahoma
is
trying
to
convince
this
court
that
under
the
capacity
limitation
there
is
a
total
limit
on
the
total
size
of
reservoirs
that
can
be
built
in
new
mexico.
that
is
not
the
position
we
have
urged
before
the
special
master,
nor
the
position
that
we
urge
here.
the
only
limitation,
capacity
limitation
which
oklahoma
is
talking
about
is
that
that
pertains
to
conservation
storage.
above
and
beyond
that
capacity
there
may
be
in
the
same
reservoir
multipurposes,
there
may
be
navigation
storage,
there
may
be
sediment
control
storage.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
mr.
chief
justice,
as
we
understand
it,
it's
not,
and
again
it
gets
into
an
engineering
question.
as
we
understand
it
the
capacities
that
are
allocated
to
reservoirs
are
basically
established
when
the
reservoir
is
planned
and
designed.
that
is
to
say
it
will
be
designed
to
have
a
useful
life
over
a
given
period
of
time,
50
to
100
years,
and
in
that
process
it
will
have
allocated
between
certain
elevations
water
for
conservation
purposes,
water
for
flood
control,
water
for
other
purposes.
that
kind
of
data
is
fixed,
i
think,
in
the
planning
and
design
process
of
the
reservoir.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
not
the
total
size
of
the
structure.
just
that
portion,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
relates
to
conservation
storage.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
i
think
we
can,
your
honor,
and
i
think
as
developed
in
this
case,
the
way
it
turns
out
is
that
at
ute
reservoir
at
a
given
elevation
you
have
outlet
works.
below
that
you
have
dead
storage
and
above
that
you
have
some
quantity
of
water
to
the
top
of
the
lake.
within
that
quantity
there
is
a
limit
of
200,000
acre-feet
for
conservation
storage,
and
then
there
is
water
above
that.
on
inquiry
we
can
ask
new
mexico
what
is
this
additional
storage
used
for.
we
hear
things
like
a
desilt
pool.
we
hear
things
like
recreation
storage,
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
justice
kennedy,
i
think
all
three
may
come
into
play.
i
think
you
are
certainly
correct
in
saying
that
it
is
the
actual
use.
we
think
it's
not
necessarily
what
new
mexico
may
choose
to
call
it,
but
the
actual
use
to
which
it
is
placing
the
waters.
it
will
also
be
in
the
design
criteria
of
the
reservoir
where
these
elevations
are,
where
these
different
capacities
are
allocated.
all
those--
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
--your
honor,
off
the
top
of
my
tongue
i
cannot
cite
you
a
treatise.
we
did
have
in
the
record
admitted
certain
treatises
on
sediment
control
and
multipurpose
design
criteria
where
it
did
talk
about
how
reservoirs
are
allocated
certain
different
types
of
storages
if
it
is
a
multipurpose
reservoir.
now,
if
you
were
a
sole
purpose
conservation
storage
reservoir,
obviously
it
would
be
limited
to
200,000
acre-feet
capacity
under
our
reading
of
article
iv(b).
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
i
think
under
our
theory,
justice
souter,
it
is
simply
that
once
new
mexico
has
conservation
storage
capacity
in
excess
of
200,000
acre-feet,
that
capacity,
that
excess
water
that
might
be
represented
in
that
excess
capacity
is
required
to
be
released
to
the
downstream
states,
because
the
extent
of
the
stream
flow
depletion
by
new
mexico
was
clearly
intended
to
be
limited
to
200,000
acre-feet.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
that
is
our
theory.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
and
to
clarify,
we
certainly--
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
--justice
scalia,
we
have
interpreted
recreation
use
as
being
a
consumptive
use
under
the
compact.
the
special
master
has
in
effect
ruled
that
recreation
is
chargeable
against
conservation
storage
where
it
is
held
in
place
and
kept
within
the
state
and
not
released.
we
concur
with
that
theory,
and
my
reason
for
pointing
that
out
is
if
you
had
200,000
acre-feet
of
conservation
storage,
100,000
acre-feet
on
top
of
that
for
recreation,
you've
got
300,000
acre-feet
of
conservation
storage
under
our
reading
of
the
compact.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
that
would
be
a
correct
analogy
with
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
it
would
be
a
recreation
use
of
the
water,
although
new
mexico
has
tried
to
advance
the
theory
that
it's
recreation
storage
and
not
conservation
storage.
that
has
been
rejected
by
the
special
master.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
if
i
may
clarify,
your
honor,
they
can
only
store
200,000
acre-feet
for
what
are
deemed
to
be
conservation
storage
uses
and
purposes.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
they
could
not
increase
their
storage
capacity
for
conservation
purposes.
but
in
addition
to
that
they
may
have
temporary
storage
for
flood
control,
for
example,
that
is
not
conservation
storage.
they
may
have
temporary
storage
for
navigation,
which
is
not
conservation
storage.
they
may
have
temporary
storage
for
some
type
of
hydropower
that
would
not
be
a
conservation
storage.
and
the
reason
they're
not
conservation
storage
is
that
typically
those
waters
will
ultimately
be
released
from
the
reservoir
to
the
downstream
states,
given
the
very
nature
of
their
uses.
the
conservation
storage
uses,
municipal-industrial
water
supply,
we
have
included
recreation,
irrigation,
those
types
of
uses
are
conservation
storage
uses
which
come
out
of
the
conservation
storage
capacity
section
of
the
reservoir.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
sediment
control
storage
is
not
part
of
conservation
storage--
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
--and
not
chargeable
against
the
200,000.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
i
think
that
is
consistent
with
the
theory,
justice
souter.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
again,
i
would
want
to
articulate
and
qualify
it.
any
additional
capacity
can
exist
which
does
not
constitute
conservation
storage
capacity,
or
nonconservation
uses.
there
can
be
additional
capacities
to
that.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
your
honor,
that...
may
i
finish
my
answer,
your
honor?
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
and
my
choice
of
words
was
not
articulate
at
that
point.
sediment
control
is
special
in
that
it's
unused
water.
it's
not
released,
but
it
is
unused
but
necessary
for
sediment
deposition.
mr.
r.
thomas
lay
thank
you,
your
honor.
