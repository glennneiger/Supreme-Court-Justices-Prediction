justice
white
are
the
provisions
of
the
compact
that
you
are
talking
about
in
your
brief?
justice
white
i
suppose
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
argument
on
this
point
if
instead
of
building
ute
reservoir
you
had
enlarged
conchas
dam?
justice
white
and
you
could
have
caught
the
floodwaters
in
that
dam
and
nobody
could
have
hardly
disputed
your
right
to
do
that.
justice
white
but
your,
you
claim
that
limitation
only
applies
to
water
originating
below
conchas;
is
that
it?
justice
white
could
i
ask,
is
there
any
major
concern
here
or
any
question
about
water
originating
above
conchas
that
is
delivered
directly
to
the
ute
without
going
through
conchas
dam?
are
there
some
tributaries
of
the
canadian
that
originate
above
conchas
and
flow
into
the
canadian
below
conchas?
justice
white
well,
is
there,
but
is
that...
the
same
argument,
i
suppose,
would
apply
to
those,
the
water
arriving
in
the
canadian
below
conchas
if
it
originated
above.
justice
white
oh,
so
there
are
no,
no
tributaries
of
the
canadian
that
originate
above
conchas
that
flow
into
the
canadian
below
conchas?
justice
white
what
do
you
mean
above
conchas,
by
the
way?
in
that
particular
watershed?
justice
white
um
hum.
justice
white
but
they
flow
into
the
river,
do
they?
justice
white
they
don't
flow
directly
into
the
reservoir?
justice
white
so
you
in
effect
said
we
don't
anticipate
any
need
for
more
water
below
conchas
than
200,000
acre-feet.
that
was
your
best
estimate
of
what
your
needs
would
be
in
the
future?
justice
white
well,
is
there
any
possible
way
that
you
could
use
250,000
acre-feet
then?
justice
white
it's
drying
up.
justice
white
so
you
could
use
the,
if
there
is
floodwater
that
you're
going
to
store
in
ute
beyond
200,000
feet,
you
can
use
it?
justice
white
well,
you
know,
if
you
don't
use
it
sooner
or
later
it
will
evaporate.
justice
white
does
the
compact
recite
that
they
intend
to
equitably
apportion
the
waters?
justice
white
because
that's
sort
of
a
term
of
art
in
original
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
white
so
you
say
the,
you
say
the
water,
the
overflow
water
from
conchas,
you
should
say
arises
below
conchas?
justice
white
although
it
came
from
above,
it
arises
below?
justice
white
the
waters
arising
above.
justice
white
and
floods
were
rare.
justice
white
so
what,
what
percentage
of
the
water,
of
the
storage
in,
what
is
it,
lake
meredith?
justice
white
what
percentage
of
storage
there
comes
from
the
canadian,
or
comes
from
new
mexico,
put
it
that
way?
justice
white
roughly
half.
justice
white
and
of
course
there
are
a
lot
of
other,
a
lot
of
tributaries
flow
into
the
canadian
below
ute.
justice
white
what
other
water
besides
the
canadian
services
meredith?
justice
white
there
are
no,
no
other
streams
that
flow
directly
into
meredith?
justice
white
what's
the
capacity
of
meredith?
justice
white
but
you
don't
question
their
right
to
keep
200,000
acre-feet
there,
do
you?
justice
white
you're
just,
you're
mostly
fighting
over
floodwaters?
justice
white
have
they
made
any
claim
in
this
case
that
they
are
entitled
to
those
waters?
justice
white
it
would
cost
them
more
than
it's
worth?
justice
white
so
as
a
practical
matter
we're
just
talking
about
the
floodwaters?
justice
white
you
don't
say
there's
any,
it's
really
very...
that
it's
impractical,
is
it,
to
measure
the
floodwaters,
the
amount
of
water
that
flows
over
the
conchas
dam?
they
know
all
that.
justice
white
well,
i
know
there
may
not
be,
but
it
wouldn't
be
easy
to,
it
wouldn't
be
hard
to
have
it.
justice
white
well,
yeah,
and
it
wouldn't
cost
a
fortune
either,
would
it?
justice
white
yeah,
all
right.
justice
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
involves
a
respective
rights
of
new
mexico,
texas
and
oklahoma
to
the
waters
of
the
canadian
river.
the
court
pointed
a
special
master.
the
special
master
has
filed
a
report
and
the
states
have
filed
exceptions
to
that
report.
the
case
was
argued
and
we
now
sustain
the
exceptions
in
part
and
overrule
the
exceptions
in
part.
and
the
case
has
remanded
to
the
special
master
for
further
proceedings,
just
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
and
justice's
o'connor,
scalia
and
kennedy
have
joined
the
chief
justice.
