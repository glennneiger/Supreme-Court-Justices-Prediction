justice
kennedy
and
their
headlands
are
below
conchas
as
well?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
we
were
to
say
that
the,
section
(b)
applies
to
the
capacity,
to
the
size
of
the
reservoir,
could
you
come
back
and
say
well,
we
are
still
entitled
to
have
an
unlimited
reservoir
for
waters
that
originate
above
the
dam?
justice
kennedy
and
it's...
and
would
you
then
further
say
it's
impossible
to
say
which
is
which,
or--
justice
kennedy
--not
which
water
is
which,
but
which
reservoir
is
which.
justice
kennedy
yes.
how
could--
--you
want
to
say
yes
to
that,
i
think.
justice
kennedy
does
that
make
sense
from
a
standpoint
of
water
engineering
and
water
law
to
say
that
one
reservoir
is
for
lower
conchas
waters
and
the
other
is
for
upper
conchas
waters?
justice
kennedy
but
then
it
doesn't,
it
doesn't
hurt
you.
if
you
say
that
they're
indistinguishable,
then
you
can
build
as
big
a
reservoir
as
you
want
and
say
oh,
well,
this
is
for
upper
conchas
water.
justice
kennedy
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
reservoir
below
conchas.
justice
kennedy
well,
we're
talking
about
whether
or
not
capacity
as
opposed
to
actual
water
stored
is
the
correct
interpretation.
justice
kennedy
and
i'm
asking
you
to
assume
that
we
say
that
it's
capacity.
i'm
then
asking
how
that
could
be
interpreted
since
you
can
come
back
and
say
well,
we're
keeping
this
capacity
for
upper
conchas
water
which
is
ours.
i
mean,
can
you
make
that
argument?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
that's
all
you're
entitled
to
under
the
contract.
justice
kennedy
that's
all
you're
entitled
to,
is
the
waters
that
originate
above
the
conchas,
other
than
for
the
200,000
feet
you're
given
below
it.
justice
kennedy
and
i
take
it
from
the
earlier
part
of
your
argument
that
the
sanford
reservoir,
the
sanford
project
was
planned
without
regard
to
floodwaters?
justice
kennedy
does
the
history
show
that
in
planning
for
the
feasibility
of
the
project
they
depended
on
floodwaters?
justice
kennedy
well,
do
you
determine
it
by
the
actual
use
that
is
made
from
time
to
time,
or
the
intent
with
which
it
was
stored,
or
the
design,
the
design
features
of
the
dam,
or
all
three?
justice
kennedy
do
you
cite
some
treatises
or
some
history
where
the
term
conservation
storage
is
contrasted
and
compared
with
other
types
of
storage?
