justice
souter
can
you
just
raise
the
spillway
in
a
case
like
that?
build
a
great
big
reservoir
and
just
keep
the
spillway
at
the
appropriate
level,
and
as
it
silts
up
you
raise
the
spillway
up.
justice
souter
how
do
you
administer
it
on
your
theory?
let's
assume
new
mexico
has
decided
to
use
the
gross
storage
capacity
of
the
ute
dam
by
storing,
in
addition
to
its
200,000
acre-feet,
an
x-hundred
thousand
acre-feet
for
recreational
purposes.
do
you
in
effect
take
that
as
some
kind
of
a
benchmark
so
that
when
the,
when
there
is
a
spillover
that
comes
down
the
river
you
in
effect
say
you've
got
to
let
it
all
spill
out
at
the
other
end?
is
it
as
simple
as
that
on
your
theory?
justice
souter
you
might
let
them...
i
take
it
on
your
theory
it
would
be,
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
compact
if
they
in
good
faith
said
well,
we
want
to
raise
the
water
level
three
more
feet
for
recreational
purposes.
you'd
say
that's
all
right.
but
you'd
say
once
that
is
done,
once
you
get
to
whatever
the
bonafide
recreational
level
capacity
is,
anything
more
that
flows
into
that
dam
has
got
to
flow
out
of
that
dam?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
well
then
let
me
go
back
to
my
question,
because
i
don't
think
i
understood,
or
i
may
have
misled
you.
i
take
it
your
answer
now
is
that
regardless
of
what
they
may
do
with
or
for
recreational
purposes
in
the
ute
reservoir,
they
can
only
store
200,000
acre-feet
in
the
ute
reservoir.
and
anything
that
spills
in
to
raise
the
level
above
that
has
got
to
spill
back
out?
justice
souter
but
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
was
that
they
couldn't
store
anything
more
for
any
other
purpose.
they
could
use
their
conservation
water
for
recreation,
but
they
couldn't
increase
their
storage
for
recreational
purposes.
justice
souter
would
it
be
too
crude
to
say,
then,
to
summarize
what
you
have
said,
that
the
capacity
can
be
increased
for
any
purpose
which
is
realized
ultimately
by
releasing
the
water
over
the
dam?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
each
of
those
capacities,
as
i
understand
you
to
have
described
them,
requires
by
its
very
nature
the
release
of
the
water?
