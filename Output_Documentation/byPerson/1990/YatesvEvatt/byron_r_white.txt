justice
white
tell
me,
what
did
the...
did
the
supreme
court
in
this
latest
round
here
say
it
was
harmless
error
because
the
jury...
there
was
so
much
evidence
of
davis'--
justice
white
--culpability
that
the
presumption
was
harmless
error?
justice
white
and
without
any
reference
to
yates'
culpability?
justice
white
because
this
is
an
accomplice
case?
justice
white
but,
i
suppose
under
our
cases
the
person
who
is
sentenced
to
death
must
have
himself
or
herself
intended
to
kill
somebody?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
thought
they
said
all
they
needed
to
do
was
to
find
that
davis
was
culpable?
justice
white
so
you're
just
arguing
mainly
here
that
there
just...
it
couldn't
have
been
harmless
error
because
there
was
so
little
evidence?
is
that
it?
justice
white
--well,
what...
are
you
suggesting
we
say
that
they
focused
on
the
wrong...
on
the
wrong
evidence,
namely
the
evidence
relating
to
davis
rather
than
to
yates?
justice
white
and
ask
them
to
focus
on
yates?
or
do
you
think
they
focused
on
yates
and
said
even
if...
even
if
we
must
look
at
the
evidence
of
yates'
culpability,
that
we
have
already
done
so,
as
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming
about
yates?
did
they
say
that?
justice
white
well,
you,
you
expect
us
to...
would
it
satisfy
you
if
we
said...
sent
it
back
again
and
said
focus
on
yates?
justice
white
your
argument
seems
to
be
that
they
have
focused
on
davis
rather
than
yates.
justice
white
do
you...
you
want
us
to
decide
the
whole
thing
here
and
say
they
focused
on
davis
rather
than
yates,
and
focusing
on
yates
it
couldn't
possibly
be
harmless
error,
the
presumption?
justice
white
well,
what
about
harmless
error
as
applied
to
yates?
justice
white
what
about
whether
this
presumption
was
harmless
error
as
applied
to
yates?
justice
white
so
if...
davis'
malice
automatically
proves
yates'?
justice
white
and
whether
the
death
penalty...
we're
talking
about
guilt
or
innocence
here?
justice
white
and
not
about
the
death
penalty?
justice
white
and
they
death...
whether
the
death
penalty
is,
in
this
case
is
valid
is
still
to
be
decided?
justice
white
you
think...
you
think
the...
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
notion
of
presuming
somebody's
intent
as
known...
where
it's
known
to
the
crime,
you
don't
think
it
violates
that
rule
against
presuming
it
to
presume
it
from
the
fact
that
your
accomplice
had
it,
had
intent?
justice
white
well,
it
is
sort
of
a
presumption,
isn't
it?
justice
white
if
davis
has
it,
yates
has
it.
isn't
that...
that
is--
justice
white
--that's
not
much
of
a
way
of
proving
yates'--
justice
white
well,
they...
you're
really
saying
that
the,
whatever
presumptions
were
given
to
the
jury
in
this
case
are
wholly
irrelevant
with
respect
to
yates.
justice
white
xxx?
justice
white
well,
suppose...
do
you
think
it
was
harmless
error
to...
do
you
think
that
presumption
was
harmless
error
with
respect
to
davis?
justice
white
suppose
davis
was
still
around
and
they
both
were
on
trial,
and
all
this
happened,
they
were
both
convicted
under
these
presumptions.
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
error
to
hold
that
this
presumption
instruction
was
harmless
error
with
respect
to
davis?
justice
white
let's
assume
that
it
wouldn't
have,
it
wouldn't
have.
would
you
say
it
was
still
harmless
error
with
respect
to
yates?
