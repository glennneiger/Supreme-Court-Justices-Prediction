justice
scalia
but
at
least
as
for
yates
you
certainly...
i'm
not
sure
that
you
don't
know
enough
about
the
use
of
the
weapon
with
respect
to
davis.
you
may
well
know
enough.
you
certainly...
it
doesn't
say
how
many
circumstances
of
its
use
have
to
be
introduced,
the
instruction
to
the
jury.
it
just
says
once
the
circumstances--
justice
scalia
--well,
but
giving
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
to
davis...
certainly
as
to
yates,
the
full
circumstances
of
the
use
of
the
weapon
were
introduced.
how
he
fired,
it
went
through
the
hand,
lodged
in
the
chest,
and
so
forth.
justice
scalia
that,
that
was
quite
complete.
justice
scalia
well,
but
you're
talking
about
malice...
you're
not
contending
that
malice,
for
purposes
of
south
carolina
law,
means
intent
to
kill?
justice
scalia
i
think
it's
more
than
being
reckless,
isn't
it,
to
go
into
a
store
with
a
knife
in
your
hand,
and
when
someone
tries
to
stop
the
robbery,
to
struggle
with
a
knife
in
your
hand
and
end
up
the
struggle
with
the
knife
lodged
in
somebody's
heart?
i
mean,
you
condemn
that
as
reckless
action?
that's
much
more
than
reckless,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
isn't
that
the
case
when
you...
when
you
commit
a
store
robbery
with
a
knife
in
your
hand
and
struggle
when
someone
tries
to
stop
the
robbery
with
the
knife
in
your
hand,
even
if
you
don't
intentionally
plunge
it
into
someone's
heart,
struggle
in
such
a
fashion
that
that's
the
result?
justice
scalia
could
it
reach
any
other
conclusion,
other
than
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that,
other
than
an
absolute
intent
to
kill,
which
is
covered
by
the
intent
requirement?
justice
scalia
but
the
court's
instruction
said,
"and
it
ultimately
remains
the
responsibility
for
you,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
under
all
the
evidence
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
malice
existed
in
the
mind
and
heart
of
the
killer
at
the
time
the
fatal
blow
was
struck.
"
justice
scalia
that
doesn't
refer
to
yates.
nobody
would
think
that--
justice
scalia
let's
assume
that
the
jury
focused
on
yates,
all
right?
now
the
error
in
question
is
what?
what
instructions
are
we
concerned
about.
presumption.
justice
scalia
all
right.
now--
justice
scalia
--one
of
the
two
presumptions
was
the
bubble
presumption,
is
that
correct?
is
that
the
one
we're
talking
about?
justice
scalia
now,
why,
why
doesn't
the
second
sentence
of
that
instruction
automatically
render
the
first
sentence,
"if
you
consider
it
error",
to
be
harmless?
"i
further
tell
you
that
when
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
use
of
that
deadly
weapon
are
put
into
evidence
and
testified
to
the
presumption
is
removed.
"
now
the
circumstances
were
put
into
evidence
and
testified
to,
so
even
if
the
presumption
was
an
erroneous
one,
no
harm
done.
justice
scalia
could
any
jury
have
found
that
presumption
to
be
operative,
namely
the
doing
of
a
willful,
deliberate,
and
intentional
unlawful
act
that
wouldn't
necessarily
have
found
what
is...
what
was
necessary
to
establish
malice
under
south
carolina
law
here,
which
is
an
intentional
killing?
justice
scalia
and
that
is
not
enough
under
south
carolina--
justice
scalia
--yes.
i
was
rather
assuming
that
you
did
except
in
name,
and
you
say
you
really
don't.
justice
scalia
mr.
shealy,
in
the...
in
south
carolina
is
it
the
practice
to
send
the
jury
instructions
in
written
form
to
the
jury,
or
are
they
just
delivered
orally?
justice
scalia
so
that
they
had
to
just
catch
all
this
orally?
justice
scalia
or
to
put
it
differently,
what
you're
arguing
is
that
this
error
in
the
supreme
court's
harmless
error
determination
was
harmless
error,
basically.
that's
the
question
before
us
in
a
way.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
to
say
that
you
have
a
felony
murder
law.
that's...
that's
the
line
of
reasoning
i
was
going
along,
but
now
we're
assured
that
there's,
there's
no
such
thing
as
automatic
conviction
for
felony
murder.
justice
scalia
but
you're
saying
there
is.
that
as
a
practical
matter
that's
the
case.
