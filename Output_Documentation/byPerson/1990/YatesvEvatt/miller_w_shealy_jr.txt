mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
record
proves
in
this
case
that
any
error
in
the
malice
instruction
is
factually
harmless.
as
such
there
is
no
reason
why
this
court
should
not
give
effect
to
the
natural
and
common
sense
conclusion
that
the
error
is
immaterial.
the
petitioner
has
shown
no
good
reason
why
an
error
which
is
factually
harmless
should
be
legally
prejudicial.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
deciding
this
case
properly
found
that
davis'
malice
was
the
key
for
the
whole
crime.
they
properly
found,
under
rose
v.
clark
and
under
chapman
v.
california,
that
the
malice
instruction
here
would
not
have
had
to
have
been
relied
upon
by
the
jury
to
conclude
that
davis
did
in
fact
have
malice.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
following
the
harmless
error
analysis
here
the
court
in
essence
has
concluded
that
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming
of
davis'
malice
that
the
jury
would
not
have
had
to
do
that.
i
think
the
facts
here
in
that
regard...
have
to
be
clear
about
those
and
bring
them
out.
davis
clearly
planned
the
armed
robbery
with
yates.
he
went
into
the
store.
he
was
armed
with
a
knife--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--i
think
it,
the
proper
test
would
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
instructions
would
not
have
made
a
difference
in
this
case
because
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
i
think,
in
spite
the
articulate
turn
of
phrase,
i
think
that
the
record
nevertheless
supports
the--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--again,
i
would
say
it's...
a
strange
turn
of
phrase,
but
i
think
in
the
cases
they
cited
and
the
way
they
wrote
the
opinion
i
would
argue
that...
not
focus
on
that
one
bit
of
language,
that
they
had
to
consider
the
whole
record
here
under
rose
v.
clark,
and
properly
decided
the
case.
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
i
simply
think
when
one
takes
the
whole
opinion
in
context,
the
way
they
recite
the
facts,
the
way
they
state
the
facts,
i
think
it's
perfectly--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
but
i
think,
as
this
court
has
said
and
many
times,
while
it
usually
sends
cases
back
for
harmless
error
analysis,
it
can
apply
the
harmless
error
analysis
and
it
can
do
it.
and
i
think
on
these
facts
it
is
clearly
harmless
error.
i
think,
once
again,
the
facts
of
davis'
malice,
they
are
both
in
the
store,
they
both
have
a
deadly
weapon,
they
both
demanded
money
from
willie
wood.
and
a
key
point
about
davis'
malice
which
the
petitioner
didn't
bring
out
in
oral
argument
is
that
it
was
davis
who
instructed
yates
to
fire
the
shots
at
willie
wood.
yates
was
ultimately
convicted
also
not
just
of
murder
but
of
assault
and
battery
with
intent
to
kill,
armed
robbery,
and
conspiracy
to
commit
armed
robbery.
the
record
is
clear.
davis
says
to
yates,
shoot.
yates
shoots
and
hits
willie
wood
twice,
and
was
convicted
of
assault
and
battery
with
intent
to
kill
on
willie
wood
for
that
crime.
that
is
also
evidence
of
yates'
malice...
excuse
me,
davis'
malice,
and
his
intent
throughout
this
whole
crime.
so
we
would
submit
it
is
clearly
harmless
error.
there
is
just
no
other
reasonable
conclusion
that
the
jury
could
have
drawn.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
think
you
need
the
jury,
i
just
think
that
the...
i
think
here
it's
just
a
traditional
harmless
error
analysis.
the
record
is
so
overwhelming
on
davis'
malice--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
well,
here
again
this
concerns
the
south
carolina
law
of
accomplice
liability.
strictly
speaking,
yates'
mental
state
as
far...
is
not
relevant
as
far
as
helen
wood
is
concerned.
yates
is
guilty
under
the
law
of
accomplice
liability,
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix
on
page
150,
if
i
might,
where
the
law
of
accomplice
liability
is
defined
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
case
below.
what
the
jury
in
essence
has
to
find
is
that
these
two
men
combined
together
to
commit
an
unlawful
act,
in
this
case
armed
robbery,
that
a
killing
arose
out
of
this,
and
that...
has
to
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
as
a
natural
and
probable
consequence
of
this
combination
of
this
crime
and
the
way
it
was
committed,
that
a
killing
was
likely
to
result.
the
jury
does
not
need
to
find,
to
convict
yates
of
murder,
that
he
specifically
intended
the
death
result
or
subjectively
expected
that
one
was
likely.
they
must
merely
find
that
it
was,
given
the
way
the
crime
occurred
and
the
nature
of
the
crime,
that
one
was
quite
likely
to
in
fact
occur.
and
i
think
that's
supported--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--if
he
meets
the
other...
other
tests
and
other
elements
of
the
law
of
accomplice
liability.
and
it's
very
important
to
understand
precisely
what
that
is
as
far
as
the
conviction
for
murder.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--that's
exactly
right.
the
only
thing
that--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--i
think
so.
let
me
say
in
response
that
the
only
thing
that
you
have
before
you
here
today
is
from
the
guilt
phase.
you
have
no
evidence
from
the
sentencing
phase.
and
furthermore
i
would
point
out
that,
following
tison,
this
court
did
say
in
tison,
to
the
extent
that
this
court
believes
it
is
relevant,
is
that
one
whose
participation
is
major
and
whose
mental
state
is
one
of
reckless
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life,
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
preclude
the
death
penalty
in
that
case.
and
that's
not
properly
before
the
court--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--no,
sir,
because
again,
once
again--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--i
don't
think
it's
just
a
presumption.
i
think
he
has--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--the
jury,
once
again--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--well,
once
again,
even
though
the
death
penalty
issue
is
not
before
the
court,
the
jury
is
not
presuming.
it
was
what
they
are
charged
in
the
law
of
accomplice
liability.
they
must
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
did
combine
with
yates,
i
mean
with
davis,
that
he
did
not
withdraw,
that
they
worked
together
to
commit
the
crime,
it
was
part
of
a
general
common
scheme
enterprise
from
which
a
death
was
a
reasonable
or
likely
result.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
jury
must
find
all
that.
so
i
don't
think
that's
in
a
genuine
sense
presumption.
they
have
got
to
find
that
this
criminal
enterprise,
this
scheme
was
such
that
a
death
was
a
natural
and
probable
consequence.
and
they
must
also
find
as
a
specific
fact
that
yates
and
davis
were
together
on
the
initial
enterprise.
and
i
would
point
out
that,
but
for
the
murder,
the
assault
and
battery
with
intent
to
kill,
the
armed
robbery,
and
the
conspiracy
to
commit
armed
robbery,
at
least
as
far
as
the
armed
robbery
and
conspiracy
to
commit
armed
robbery
is
concerned,
those
are
almost
conceded
by
yates'
own
testimony.
they
are.
the
assault
and
battery
with
intent
to
kill
was
an
issue,
but
the
conspiracy
to
commit
armed
robbery
and
the
crime
of
armed
robbery
was
virtually
conceded
by
yates.
there
is
no
question
about
the
common
scheme
or
plan
involved
here.
i
would
also
point,
going
back
to
one
of
justice
scalia's
questions,
is
whether
the
jury
in
this
case
would
have
in
fact
focused
on
davis'
malice,
and
i
don't
think
that
following
the
standard
in
boyd
v.
california
and
cup
v.
knowlton,
there
is
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
they
would
have
done
anything
else.
not
only
is
the
language
cited
by
justice
scalia
relevant
at
the
bottom
of
page
96
and
the
top
of
97,
that's
the
primary
language
relied
on
by
the
state
supreme
court
that
it's
the
malice
of
the
killer
which
is
relevant,
but
look
to
the
middle
of
page
97,
where
the
court
says,
and
if
i
may
read,
"if
two
or
more
parties
combine
together
to
commit
an
unlawful
act,
and
in
the
commission
of
that
criminal
act,
a
homicide
is
committed
by
one
of
the
parties
and
the
homicide
was
a
probable
or
natural
consequence
of
the
acts
done
in
pursuance
of
the
agreed-upon
unlawful
act.
"
and
this
is
the
part...
significant
language,
"all
present,
participating
in
the
unlawful
undertaking,
are
as
guilty
as
the
one
who
committed
the
fatal
act.
"
the
only
one
who
committed
the
fatal
act
in
this
case
is
henry
davis,
and
he
killed
helen
wood.
that
focused
the
jury
once
again
on
the
difference
between
yates
and
davis,
and
it
was
davis,
the
person
who
committed
the
fatal
act,
whose
malice
they
had
to
focus
on.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
that
did
not
affect,
in
the
sense
that
they
did
not
affect
the
jury's
consideration
of
his
mental
state
in
any
way,
that
is
correct.
that
is
precisely
what
we're
arguing.
once
again
on
page
98,
the
judge,
in
the
distinction
between
the
private
malice
distinction
there
refers
to
the
slayer,
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
paragraph
on
page
98.
it
says
it's
the
malice
and
the
ill
will
of
the
slayer
versus
that
of
the
accomplice,
again
focusing
on
davis.
the
jury
could
have
not
heard
these
instructions,
simply
could
not
have
done
that
and
walked
away
and
not
focused
on
davis'
malice.
i
also
think
one
final
point
that
is
very
important
here
to
keep
in
mind
is
the
distinction
between
malice
and
intent,
which
we
have
tried
to
argue
forcibly
in
our
brief.
the
petitioner
seems
to
ignore
the
distinction,
and
in
fact
almost
argues
at
times
that
the
malice
and
the
specific
intent
to
kill,
the
intent
to
kill
are
the
same
thing.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
the
court,
if
you
look
at
these
instructions
in
south
carolina
law,
the
first
thing
the
judge
did
was
tell
the
jury
precisely
what
malice
is
in
south
carolina
in
the
common
law.
it
is
something
which
springs
from
wickedness,
from
depravity,
from
depraved
spirit,
from
a
heart
devoid
of
social
duty
and
fatally
bent
on
creating
mischief.
that's
not
mere
recklessness.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
judge
did
really
identify
malice
as
intent
to
kill,
and
let
me
explain
why.
again
following
boyd
and
cup,
we're
looking
at
the
whole
charge.
right
after
the
judge
defines
malice,
following
south
carolina
common
law,
look
what
he
says
to
the
jury.
"the
words
express
or
implied
do
not
mean
different
kinds
of
malice,
but
they
mean
different
ways
in
which
the
only
kind
of
malice,
just
defined,
known
to
the
law,
may
be
shown.
"
then
he
proceeds
to
suggest
to
the
jury--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
then
he
proceeds
to
suggest
to
the
jury,
in
his
discussion
of
implied
and
expressed
malice,
the
kinds
of
evidence
they
can
consider
that
are
relevant
to
a
finding
of
express
or
implied
malice.
and
under
south
carolina
law,
and
as
at
common
law,
the
strongest
element,
evidence
of
malice
is
an
intent
to
kill.
they
are
not
the
same
thing,
but
intent
to
kill
is
strong
evidence
of
malice.
and
that
is
what
the
judge
told
the
jury
after
explaining
how
malice
could
be
shown,
not
that
it
was
the
same
thing.
he
has
defined
it,
he
has
told
them
what
kind
of
evidence
they
can
look
for
that
is
relevant
to
finding
malice,
then
he
goes
on
and
gets
into
the
presumptions
which
are
the...
really
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
following
what
was
said
by
this
court
in
francis,
that
jurors
are
assumed
to
be
conscientious
of
their
duty,
they
are
assumed
to
understand
instructions
and
to
strive
to
make
sense
out
of
them,
i
think
when
you
hear
that,
and
if
you
listen
to
the
plain
language
used
there,
we
may
just
have
a
difference
of
opinion,
but
i
think
that
what
the
jury
was
told
is
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
consider
that
is
relevant
for
malice.
he
did
not
tell
the
jury
that
malice
was
the
same
thing,
especially
after
the
previous
definition
when
the
word
intent
to
kill
was
never
used
in
this
charge.
and
in
light
of
that,
i
simply
think
that
the
jury
had
to
understand
they
had
to
focus
on
davis'
malice--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--they
are
delivered
orally.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
jury,
it
is
the
practice,
of
course,
if
the
jury
has
a
question
they
can
come
back
out
and
ask.
but
this
is...
would
have
been
delivered
orally.
let
me
address,
aside
from
davis'
malice
which
is
the
key
question
here,
the
petitioner
raises
what
he
calls
two
facts
about
yates'
mental
state
which
he
believes
would
have
been
precluded
or
preempted
by
this
malice
instruction.
first
pertains
to
yates',
and
i
think
i
have
addressed
this
somewhat,
his
subjective
expectation,
subjective
intent
that
a
killing
would
occur
from
this
crime.
and
second,
yates'
intent
to
withdraw.
first,
strictly
speaking,
once
accomplice
liability
is
properly
understood,
yates'
mental
state
is
not
the
relevant
one.
it
is
davis'.
but
to
the
extent
that
yates'
was
relevant
and
the
malice
charge
might
have
affected
it
(1)
one,
under
the
nature,
given
the
law
of
accomplice
liability,
intent...
and
this
is
the
mistake
i
believe
the
petitioner
makes,
with
all
due
respect
to
him...
intent
is
not
the
issue.
it
is
malice.
it
is
kind
of
the
extreme
gross
recklessness,
the
wanton
behavior
that
yates
so
clearly
exhibits
throughout
this
whole
crime.
he
has
planned
it,
he
has
conceded,
he
has
admitted
on
direct
that
he
has
planned
it.
he
admits
he
was
there
to
commit
an
armed
robbery.
he
admits
he
clearly
fired
a
shot
at
willie
wood
at
the
direction
of
davis,
which
struck
ultimately
willie
wood
in
the
chest.
yates'
malice
is
all
over
this
record,
and
there
is
no
way
the
jury
could
have
escaped
that.
the
instruction
could
not
have
turned
the
jury's
attention
away
from
yates'
mental
state,
because
the
malice
is
just
so
overwhelming
they
just
had
to
recognize
it
given
the
nature
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
same
thing...
i'm
sorry,
the
same
thing
is
true,
i
think,
of
the...
yates'
intent
to
withdraw
here.
once
again,
the
charge
on
withdrawal
is
proper
under
south
carolina
law.
exactly
what
does
yates
do
here?
under
his
own
testimony...
his
own
testimony
is
virtually
the
only
evidence
of
this.
he
leaves
the
store
with
his
gun
and
the
money
in
hand.
he
runs
out
to
the
passenger
side
of
the
vehicle,
not
the
driver's
side,
the
passenger
side,
gets
in,
and
under
his
own
testimony,
waits,
waits
for
henry
davis,
his
accomplice,
to
come
out
of
the
store.
he
is
still
involved
in
the
criminal
enterprise.
they're
just
trying
to
make
a
getaway
at
this
point.
once
he
realizes
that
henry
davis
is
in
trouble,
perhaps
shot,
as
he
was,
or
caught,
he
slides
over
onto
the
driver's
seat
and
makes
his
getaway,
and
is
caught
moments
or
minutes
later.
there
is
no
withdrawal
here
whatsoever.
there
is
not
even
evidence
of
withdrawal
in
the
record,
i
think,
if
properly
understood.
clearly
yates
was
involved
in
the
criminal
enterprise
to
the
end.
he
was
trying
to
make
his
getaway;
he
was
not
trying
to
withdraw.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
a
couple
of
things.
first
if
i
can
address
the
lunged
portion
first,
if
you
read
the
facts,
and
i
think
i
presume
correct
in
the
brief,
you
read
the
facts
and
the
testimony
of
willie
wood
very
carefully,
i
think
you
get
the
following
picture.
and
by
the
way,
the
argument
the
petitioner
makes
to
this
court
about
willie
wood's
testimony,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
jury
at
closing
argument
to
disbelieve
him.
but
that's
the
only
thing
we
have
in
the
record
on
appeal.
willie
wood
testified
that
once
yates
left
the
store
the
only
inference
in
the
record
is
that
davis
came
at
him
with
the
knife,
and
on
two
occasions
willie
wood
says
he
was
trying
to
stab
me
in
the
back.
the
only
inference
is
that
davis
was
behind
wood,
chasing
him
with
the
knife,
and
willie
wood
was
trying
to
get
away.
he
had
a
gun
on
him,
we
later
found,
under
his
coat
which
he
was
trying
to
get
to
later,
but
at
that
time
he
was
scared
yates
was
going
to
get
him
in
the
back.
once
they
got
into
a
scuffle,
if
you
read
very
carefully
mr.
wood's
testimony,
he
got
in
a
scuffle
with
yates
and
it
appears
is
that
helen
wood
came
from
behind
and
grabbed
yates
in
an
effort
to
pull
him
off
willie
wood
at
the
last
minute
from
behind.
i
would
submit
that
as
far
as
the
lunging
is
concerned,
the
only
way
helen
wood
could
have
gotten
stabbed
is
if
yates
had
somehow
turned,
thrust
the
knife,
and
the
pathologist's
testimony
in
this
record
clearly
indicates
that
the
stab
wound
penetrated,
and
i
quote
almost
verbatim,
the
full
thickness
of
her
chest,
and
stabbed
her
like
that.
i
don't
see
how
she
could
have
been
stabbed
unless
he
lunged
or
thrusted
in
some
manner.
so
perhaps
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
inferred
it
from
that.
as
far
as
the
multiple
stabbing
is
concerned,
i
think
that's
an
artful
phrase.
i
think
it
clearly
shows
she
was
stabbed
once,
although
through
the
full
thickness
of
her
chest,
as
the
pathologist
testified.
it
wasn't
a
scrape,
it
wasn't
a
nick.
it
was
something
that
plunged
the
knife
through
her
entire
chest.
i
don't
even
think
those
facts
(1)
are
really
crucial
to
the
harmless
error
analysis.
whether
or
not
she
lunged,
which
i
think
there
was
a
lunge,
which
i
think
there
was
as
a
multiple
stabbing,
is
beside
the
point.
the
question
is
whether
davis
had
malice
as
charged
and
properly
defined.
this
court
can
find
that
even
on
its
own
authority
without
the
supreme
court's--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--i
agree.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
i
agree
it
would
certainly
be
stronger
if
there
were
multiple
stabbing.
but
what
i
simply
mean
to
say
to
your
honor
is
i
think...
assuming
there
is
not,
assuming
there
is
the
stabbing
as
we
have
it
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
evidence
is
still,
i
think,
overwhelming
of
davis'
malice,
which
is
something
this
court
can
find.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
i
don't...
the
lunging
is,
i
think...
i
do
stick
to
that.
i
think
that's
the
only
inference
in
the
record,
the
multiple
stabbing,
i
think
is
the
only
misstatement.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
that's
your
honor's
phrase.
perhaps
so.
but
i
do
think
this
court
on
its
own
authority
can
conduct
the
harmless
analysis.
it
has
done
so
in
the
past
and
it
can
do
so
now.
i
would
also
point
out
that
with
regard
to
the,
to
the
malice
charge
in
this
case,
that
there
was
no
objection
at
trial
to
this
charge.
the
court
has
often
referenced
that
in
making
its
own
harmless
error
analysis
in
cases
like
this.
a
trial
attorney
didn't
obviously
think
it
was
harmless,
has
no
objection
in
the
record,
so
i
would
invite
the
court
to
consider
that
as
part
of
its
analysis.
as
far
as
the
prosecutor's
argument
is
concerned,
let
me
address
that
because
the
petitioner
did
address
that
in
his
oral
arguments.
the
prosecutor
did
for
sure
argue
to
the
jury
that
there
was
an
intent
to
kill,
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
strong
evidence
of
intent
to
kill,
and
the
jury
could
have
found
that
on
this
record.
but
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
that
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
case
this
is.
this
is
a
capital
case.
you're
only
focusing
now
on
the
guilt
phase.
from
the
beginning
of
this
case
the
prosecutor
knew
and
was
trying
to
get
to
a
jury
verdict
at
the
end
which
would
result
in
a
sentence
of
death.
for
that
reason
i
think
he
was
urging
upon
the
jury
to
find
the
highest
level
of
scienter
of
mental
state
that
he
possibly
could
to
convince
them
that
yates
was
truly
a
bad
person
and
that
the
death
penalty
was
warranted.
he
did
not
necessarily
have
to
get
to
that
high
mental
state
to
get
murder,
but
he
may
have
believed,
and
i
think
properly
so,
as
a
matter
of
trial
strategy,
that
it
was
important
to
get
to
it
in
order
to
get
a
sentence
of
death.
so
that's
how
i
explain
the
prosecutor's
argument.
i
don't
think
he
disregards
the
definition
of
malice.
the
depraved
heart
aspect
is
just
that
he
is
trying
to
up
and
reach
a
death
sentence
and
not
merely
a
murder
conviction.
with
regard
to
some
other
aspects
of
the
trial
court's
charge
here,
the
trial
judge
did,
as
i
think
justice
scalia
pointed
out
during
the
petitioner's
oral
argument,
that
he
comes
back
to
the
jury
and
in
essence
tells
them
when
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
use
of
the
deadly
weapon
are
before
the
jury,
then
in
essence
the
presumption
vanishes.
now,
i'd
submit
we
know
there's
a
scuffle.
we
know
who
had
the
weapon,
we
know
who
used
it,
we
know
how
it
was
used,
and
we
know
what
happened
to
helen
wood.
for
all
practical
intents
and
purposes,
while
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
did
not
address
that
i
believe
because
they
were
constrained
by
this
court
to
find
that
it
was
violative
of
francis
v.
franklin,
i
think
nevertheless
that
could
be
considered
as
almost
a
cure
of
that
particular
aspect
of
the
instruction,
given
the
facts
of
this
case.
bear
briefly
what...
i
would
like
to
reference
the
standard
in
this
particular
case.
i
do
believe
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
in
applying
harmless
error
analysis,
applied
the
appropriate
standard
of
chapman
v.
california,
which
seems
to
have
been
adopted
expressly
by
this
court
in
rose
v.
clark.
the
way
the
issue
was
phrased
by
this...
the
majority
of
this
court
in
rose
is,
is
chapman
v.
standard...
is
the
chapman
standard
applicable
to
sandstrom
and
francis
type
errors.
i
think
the
court
applied
that.
to
the
extent
that
the
petitioner
may
argue
that
the
carella
concurrence
is
valid
as
far
as
a
new
standard,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
harmless
under
either
standard.
that
under
south
carolina
law
looking
at
carella,
you
have
an
armed
robbery
as
defined
in
south
carolina
with
the
surrounding
circumstances,
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
that
simply
can't
be
committed
as
defined
under
south
carolina
law
without
also
having
malice.
you
don't
need
malice
under
south
carolina
law
to
be
convicted
of
armed
robbery,
but
for
sure
if
you
commit
armed
robbery...
and
if
you
commit
armed
robbery
in
south
carolina,
you
have
to
also
commit
the
lesser
included
offenses
of
larceny
and
assault.
and
to
commit
armed
robbery
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
like
this,
we
would
submit,
is
clear
evidence
of
malice,
especially
the
way
this
particular
crime
was
carried
out.
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
there
is
not.
the
reason...
i
don't
want
to--
mr.
miller
w.
shealy,
jr.
--i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
semantic
quibble.
i
shy
away
from
the
word
felony
murder
because
in
my
experience
there
is
typically
statutory
number
of
states,
and
we
don't
have
a
statute
like
that.
we
have
accomplice
liability.
the
jury
was
charged
not,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
if
you
find
a
felony,
an
armed
robbery
is
a
felony,
then
you
must
presume
malice,
and
therefore
presume
murder.
that
might
be
a
classic
and
erroneous
felony
murder
type
instruction.
that's
not
what
they
were
told.
they
were
told,
again...
to
go
back
to
page
150,
the
accomplice
liability,
if
you
find
the
unlawful
act,
the
combination
to
commit
an
unlawful
act,
and
the
way
it
was
committed
and
the
nature
of
the
act,
and
the
way
it
was
carried
out,
a
natural
and
probable
consequence
is
that
a
death
could
result,
you
can
convict
the
accomplice,
even
though
he's
not
the
slayer.
that's
what
they
were
told.
they
were
never
told,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
armed
robbery
is
a
felony.
if
you
find
the
armed
robbery
then
you
can
also
find
murder.
that
perhaps
is
felony
murder,
and
that's
not
the
charge
that
was
given
in
this
case.
if
i
may
conclude
there
briefly
by
saying
that
because
the
error
here
is
factually
harmless,
it
should
not
be
declared
legally
prejudicial.
this
is
so
because
under
the
charge
the
jury
would
have
had
to
focus
on
davis'
malice.
no
other
possibility
was
reasonably
likely.
furthermore,
nothing
in
the
charge
would
have
precluded
the
jury's
consideration
of
yates'
own
mental
state,
particularly
in
light
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
his
own
malice.
thank
you.
