mr.
david
i.
bruck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
appears
here
for
the
third
time.
on
two
prior
occasions
this
court
has
ordered
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
this
capital
murder
case
to
grant
the
relief
which
federal
law
requires.
on
its
third
consideration,
the
second
remand
by
this
court,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
now,
by
a
3
to
2
vote,
held
the
two
unconstitutional
burden-shifting
jury
presumptions
of
an
essential
element
of
malice
in
this
case
to
be
harmless
error,
and
the
propriety
of
that
harmless
error
determination
is
now
the
issue
before
this
court
today.
the
case,
as
the
court
is
already
well
aware,
involves
an
accomplice
liability
prosecution
in
which
dale
yates
was
convicted
of
murder
and
sentenced
to
death
for
a
homicide
which
was
committed
by
his
accomplice,
one
henry
davis,
during
the
course
of
a
robbery,
after
the
time
when
yates
had
already
yelled
to
davis
to
leave
the
scene,
had
himself
left
the
store,
and
was
either
waiting
in
the
car
outside
or
had
already
fled
the
area.
davis,
of
course,
was
then
shot
to
death
by
the
sole
surviving
witness
to
the
homicide,
one
willie
wood,
moments
after
the
decedent
was
stabbed
and
died.
the
state
supreme
court
has
found
the
instructions
on
malice
to
have
been
harmless
error
on
the
grounds
that
identifying
really
for
the
first
time
8
years
after
the
trial
the
real
issue
in
the
case
to
have
been
whether
or
not
davis,
the
actual
killer,
entertained
malice,
and
not
whether
mr.
yates
entertained
malice.
and
then
having
thus,
shall
we
say
clarified,
and
i
would
submit
really
changed
the
issue
that
was
placed
before
the
jury
at
trial,
into
one
concerning
whether
davis
entertained
malice
when
he
killed
the
victim,
the
court
then
simply
grossly
misread
the
simple
record
facts
before
the
jury
in
order
to
find
that
malice...
that
davis'
malice
was
overwhelmingly
proven.
the
particular
misreadings,
i
think,
which
provide
the
simplest
and
best
basis
upon
which
this
case
should
be
decided
are
simply
that
the
state
supreme
court
found
that
davis
lunged
at
mrs.
wood
with
his
knife,
and
that
he
inflicted
a
multiple
stabbing
which
resulted
in
her
death.
in
fact
the
record
contains
no
evidence
that
davis
lunged
at
mrs.
wood.
indeed
the
very
vague
and
unclear
and
unsatisfactory
evidence
from
willie
wood,
the
only
surviving
witness,
indicates
that
it
was
mrs.
wood
who
reached
for
or
grabbed
mr.
davis
from
the
side
or
from
the
rear,
and
then
seconds
later
she
was
stabbed
through
the
heart.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
of
course,
i
think
that
is
a
rather
belated
attempt
to
save
what
is...
in
any
event
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
found
to
be
a
burden-shifting
and
unconstitutional
mandatory
rebuttable
presumption
of
malice.
the...
and
i
would
note,
of
course,
that
the
state,
as
respondent,
has
made
no
such
argument
in
this
case,
either
in
the
brief
in
opposition
or
in
their
brief.
but
in
any
event,
if
the
court
were
to
wish
to
revisit
that
underlying
claim,
i
think
one
would
be
forced
to
conclude
that
there
is...
to
say
that
in
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
not
present
when
the
killing
occurred,
when
there
was
only
one
witness,
the
state's
witness,
who
himself
did
not
see...
willie
wood
did
not
see
the
stabbing.
so
it
is
not
fair
to
say
that
the...
that...
it
cannot
fairly
be
said
that
the
circumstances
attending
the
use
of
the
knife
were
brought
out
in
evidence.
they
were
not.
no
one
knows
exactly
how
the
knife
was
used,
whether
mrs.
wood
was
stabbed
when
she
lunged
at
henry
davis,
whether
he
was
flailing
in
some
way
trying
to
get
away
from
the
man
that
was
about
to
put
five
bullets
in
him
and
kill
him
when
he
accidentally
stabbed
mrs.
wood.
all
of
these
things
are
quite
possible,
but
we
simply
don't
know.
so
as
far
as
the
amicus,
this...
they
call
it
a
bursting
bubble.
i
think
the
real
term
is
a
fly
away
presumption.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
of
course.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
of
course,
but
under
south
carolina
law
that
does
not
create
an
irrebuttable
or
conclusive
presumption
of
malice,
or
it
does
not...
the
state
wishes
to
create
a
felony
murder
rule
which
does
not
exist
in
south
carolina.
the
shooting
by
yates
was
not
of
the
murder
victim,
and
so
that
cannot,
as
a
matter
of
law,
supply
the
malice.
it
is
certainly
a
factor
to
be
considered.
it
is
certainly
evidence
of
yates'
state
of
mind.
but...
but
there
were
contrary,
there
was
contrary
evidence,
including
the
fact,
the
state
argued
vigorously
at
trial
that
this
was
a,
an
intent
to
kill
scheme
from
the
beginning,
and
that
was
how
the
case
was
tried.
that
was
the
issue
that
was...
that
was
joined.
and
there
was
certainly
evidence
that
yates
did
not
have
the
intent
to
kill
anyone
else
in
the
store,
that
he
ran
out,
he
said
let's
go.
he
ran
out
of
the
store
still
believing
that
willie
wood
was
still
alive,
which
he
in
fact
was,
with
three
unspent
rounds
in
his
gun.
so
the
evidence
was
clearly
in
conflict
as
to
yates'
intent.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
it
does
not.
it...
in
this
case
it
was
tried
as
intent
to
kill.
the
judge
used
the
term
malice
interchangeably
with
intent
to
kill
all
the
way
through
his
instructions,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief.
there
are
other
ways
in
which
malice
can
be
shown,
other
than
a
specific
intent
to
kill
a
particular
individual.
however,
they
are
not
relevant
to
this
case,
both
because
they
were
not
charged
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
there
are
two
basic
theories
that
the
state
tries
to
bring
up
at
this
late
date.
one
is
so-called
depraved
heart
murder.
that
is
to
say
a
degree
of
recklessness
so
extreme
that
it
would
be
tantamount
to
intent,
and
that
it
would
support
an
inference
of
malice.
and
that's,
really...
the
state
basically
concedes,
or
at
least
fails
to
disagree
with
our
contention
that
davis'
intent
to
kill
is
not
overwhelmingly
proven,
but
they
say
it
doesn't
matter
because
mere
recklessness
is
enough.
and
mere
recklessness
is
not
enough.
recklessness
is
involuntary
manslaughter
under
south
carolina
law.
there
is,
however,
a
greater
degree
of
recklessness
which
is
known
in
the
common
law
in
most
states,
i
think,
and
certainly
in
south
carolina
as
a
depraved
heart
murder.
but
to
say
that
you...
that
it
is
proven
overwhelmingly
by
the
unsatisfactory
and
vague
evidence
in
this
case
that
we
are
not
merely
dealing
with
criminal
recklessness
in
the
handling
of
the
knife,
but
depraved
heart
malice,
that
it
is
that
degree
of
recklessness,
simply
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
if
ever
there
was
a
fine
gradation
that
our
system
of
law
entrusts
to
the
jury
to
make,
it
is
that.
and
as
to
yates'--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
reckless,
you
know,
is...
under
south
carolina...
is
more
than
negligence.
it
is
an...
it
is
a
state
of
extreme
indifference
to
human
life.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
do
not
contend
that
the
jury
could
not
reach
that
conclusion.
i
concede
that
the
evidence
is
there.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
in
all
candor
i
just
have
to
say
that
i
think
a
jury
could
reach
the
conclusion
that
while
it
was
reckless
for
him
to
have
been
in
the
situation,
for
him
to
be
accosted
from
the
side
or
from
the
rear
by
someone
that
he
may
not
have
even
known
was
there,
is
not
evidence
that
as
a
matter
of
law
or
that
conclusively
establishes
the
depraved
and
malignant
heart.
that's
the
language.
that
is
the
level
of
recklessness
that
is
required.
it
is...
it
is
a
level
of
recklessness
so
extreme
that
it
is
taken
in
the
law
to
be
the
same
as
intent,
to
be
tantamount
to
intent.
now
again,
i
do
not
deny
that
the
evidence
might
support
or
would
support
that
if
the
jury
took
that
view.
but
to
say
that
it
is
overwhelmingly
proven,
i
just
don't
think
is
supported
by
this
record.
and
i
think
that's
why
the
supreme
court
yielded
to
the
temptation
to
exaggerate
the
record.
now
a
multiple
stabbing
is
evidence
par
excellence
of
intent.
the
only
trouble
is
that
there
was
no
multiple
stabbing,
and
there
was
no
lunging.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
there
was
a
single
narrow
wound
to
the
chest.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
nothing
else.
the,
this
was
a
very
thoroughly
prosecuted
case,
but
the
prosecutor
did
not
press
on
to
determine
even
such
details
as
the
amount
of
force
that
might
be
required
to
inflict
that
wound.
and
thus
the
jury
would
be
quite
capable...
it
would
be
quite
reasonable
for
the
jury
to
conclude
that
this
could
have
been
an
accidental
stabbing,
rather
than
the
brutal,
vicious,
multiple
stabbing
described
without
evidentiary
basis
by
the
state
supreme
court.
because
the
state
supreme
court
so
exaggerated
this
record
evidence,
i
would
submit
that
this
really
is
all...
as
far
as
this
court
need
go
to
decide
this
case.
there
was
a
jury
issue
as
to
what
happened
in
that
store.
the
event
is
entirely
depicted
through
circumstantial
evidence.
what
happened
is
simply
not
clear,
and
it
cannot
fairly
be
said
that
a
jury
would
have
had
to
have
found
davis'
intent
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
simply
from
the
fragments
of
testimony
that
were
offered
by
willie
wood.
i'd
further
point
out
that
mr.
wood,
although
his
bias
is
surely
an
understandable
one,
he
is
nevertheless
about
as
biased
a
witness
as
one
is
likely
to
have.
he
is
testifying
against
someone
involved
in
the
murder
of
his
mother,
someone
who
had
himself
shot
mr.
wood
through
the
hand.
and
in
addition,
mr.
wood
had
killed
with
five
shots
the
actual
stabber,
in
this
case
mr.
davis,
and
naturally
had
to
recall
the
events
in
a
way
that
would
have
made
that
homicide
justifiable.
that's
not
to
say
that
it
wasn't
justifiable,
it's
simply
to
say
that
a
jury
could
reasonably
have
been
somewhat
critical
in
evaluating
mr.
davis'
testimony,
and
might
reasonably
have
wondered
whether
they
were
getting
a
picture
of
what
happened
in
that
store,
sketchy
as
it
was,
that
was
so
reliable
as
to
establish
malice
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
exactly
right.
they
said
that
yates'
mental
state
doesn't
matter;
it's
irrelevant.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
because
this
is
an
accomplice
case.
now,
there
are--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes,
well,
the
court
below
got
around
that
by
saying
that
well,
he
did
intend
to
kill
somebody,
or
at
least
the
jury
could
have
concluded
that
because
he
fired
at
someone
else,
at
willie
wood,
and
shot
him
through
his
out
stretched
hand
and
the
bullet
landed
in
his
pocket.
so
that
is
enough
to
support,
so
said
the
south
carolina
supreme
court--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--that's
for
the
conviction
of
murder.
we're
still
at
the
guilt
phase.
and
then...
the
trial
was
tried
before
enmund
and
the
direct
appeal
was
decided
after
enmund,
and
the
court
did
its
own
review...
made
its
own
enmund
findings
in
effect
on
direct
appeal,
and
said
that
yates
had
a
sufficiently...
that
of
course
is
a
case,
this...
which...
that
is
an
issue
which
awaits
review
on
federal
habeas,
although
i
hope
we
don't
have
to
go
there.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
that's
the
first...
that's
the
first
and
i
would
submit
the
easiest
way
of
disposing
of
this
case.
i
shouldn't
say
so
little.
there
simply
wasn't
evidence
that
conclusively
or
overwhelmingly
established
malice
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances.
the
jury
could
have
had...
could
have
had
a
doubt.
if
the
court
were
not
to
accept
that
view,
though,
and
were
to
agree
with
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
even
when
we
take
away
all
of
the
exaggeration
on
which
the
state
supreme
court's
opinion
and
judgment
actually
rest,
we
then
come
to
another
rather
serious
problem,
which
is
that
it
is
most
unlikely
in
this
case
that
the
jury
understood
its
task
to
make
any
evaluation
of
davis'
malice,
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
were
never
told
to
do
so.
on
the
contrary,
the...
most
of
the
instructions,
all
except
a
single
little
fragment
that
that
state
stakes
its
whole
case
on,
clearly
refer
to
yates
and
to
yates'
mental
state,
which
would
be
a
plausible
way
under
south
carolina
of
prosecuting
this
case.
the
court...
the
trial
court
charged
at
the
beginning
of
the
malice
instructions
that
in
order
to
convict
one
of
murder
the
state
must
not
only
prove
the
killing
of
the
deceased
by
the
defendant,
but
that
it
was
done
with
malice
aforethought.
the
killing
of
the
deceased
by
the
defendant,
that
is
mr.
yates,
and
that
it
was
done
with
malice.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
it
doesn't.
that
is
the
fragment
on
which
the
court
relies.
there
are
several
things
i
would
like
to
say
about
that.
the
first
is
that
the
jury
would
have
understood
the
term
killer
to
refer
to
defendant,
because
it's...
the
court
is
referring
at
the
beginning
of
that
same
instruction
to
must
prove
the
killing
of
the
deceased
by
the
defendant.
and
therefore
once
they
have
proven
the
killing
of
the
deceased
in
some
legal
way
by
the
law
of
parties
by
yates,
he
becomes,
for
purposes
of
these
instructions,
the
killer.
it's
clear
that
the
jury
couldn't
have
made
any
sense
of
these
instructions
and
applied
them
at
all,
unless
they
were
willing
to
treat
yates
as
the
killer
that
the
judge
was
talking
about.
i
would
further
point
out
that
that
instruction
came
before
the
judge
even
got
to
the
subject
of
accomplice
liability,
so
it's
unlikely
that
when
the
jury
heard
that
instruction
they
understood
it
in
any
way
to
refer
to
the
mental
state
of
davis.
i
think
what
that...
the
jury
most
likely
would
have
understood,
and
certainly
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
would
have
understood
that
what
that
instruction
meant
was
at
the
time
of
the
killing
they
had
to
look
at
the
intent
of
the
person
on
trial,
the
defendant,
who...
against
whom
the
killing
had
to
be
proven.
that
conclusion
is
strengthened
by
the
prosecutor's
argument
in
this
case,
which
not
once
focused
on
the
mental
state
of
davis,
the
mental
state
of
malice.
not
one
word
was
said
about
that.
on
the
contrary,
the
prosecutor
said
that
by
the
use
of
the
gun,
by
yates'
use
of
the
gun,
that
proved
that
the
intent
required,
the
requisite
intent...
i'm
sorry,
the
requisite
malice
was
in
his
heart,
that
is
in
yates'
heart.
that
is
the
way
the
prosecutor
argued
the
case.
and
under
those
circumstances
we
have
a
situation
a
little
like
clemons
v.
mississippi
where
the
prosecutor
argued
the
case
one
way
and
then
the
state
supreme
court,
without
any
explanation,
disregards
all
of
that
and
says
it
was
surely
harmless
because
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
in
some
other
way.
in
fact
in
this
case
the,
the
judge
did
not
so
instruct
the
jury.
and
to
take
this
one
phrase
out
of
context,
as
the
state
does,
without
any
careful
attention
or
any
attention
at
all,
i
would
submit--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
would--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
the
state
supreme
court
never
focused
on
yates'
malice.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
i
think
the
time
has
come
when
they
need
some
more
precise
instructions
on
how
this
case
should
be
decided.
the...
i
would
suggest
that
the--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes.
had
they
focused
on
yates
this
would
not
have
been
a
closed
case
at
all,
because
it
is
clear
that
yates'
mental
state
was
very
much
in
dispute.
yates
argued...
he
both
contested
that
he
had
any
malicious
intent
with
respect
to
any
homicide
in
the...
or
the
likelihood
of
any
homicide
in
the
store,
that
there
was
an
express
plan
to
leave
without,
the
moment
there
was
any
resistance,
without
any
use
of
violence.
now
i
realize
that
that
plan
did
not
go
as
expected.
he
did...
he
was
ordered
by
davis
to
shoot,
and
he
shot.
he
then,
however,
withdrew,
or
attempted
to,
and
called
to
davis
to
do
the
same.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far,
because
even
indulging
the
groundless
assumption
that
the
state
court...
that
the
jury
did
focus
on
davis,
the
fact
remains
that
the
error
still
isn't
harmless.
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
fair
reading
of
this
record.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
two
presumption,
unconstitutional
presumptions
of
malice.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
and
if
the
jury
focused
on
yates,
their
question
would
have
been
did
yates
have
malice
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
it
has
been
described
in
that
way,
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
i
think
it...
it
would
still
have
been
a,
a
burden-shifting
problem
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
actual
circumstances,
in
other
words
whether
they
believed
the
explanation
enough
to
relieve...
the
circumstances
suggest,
the
true
circumstances,
in
other
words
if
you,
if
you
have
been
convinced
of
the
actual
facts,
it
still
has
a
burden-shifting
quality.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
to
hammer
these...
the
so-called
fly-away
presumption
into
the
round
hole
of
sandstrom
and
malaney.
these
are,
these
are
old
jury
instructions
which
really,
i
think,
are
unconstitutional
regardless.
even
so
we're
left
with
the
other
unconstitutional
presumption
which
is
the
intentional
doing
of...
the
presumption
which
arises
from
the
intentional
doing
of
an
unlawful
act,
and
not
necessarily
a
dangerous
unlawful
act,
but
any
unlawful
act,
which
is
to
say
the
carrying
of
the
gun
or
the
plan
to
commit
the
armed
robbery.
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
twice
held
that
this
instruction
also
was
a
burden-shifting
and
unconstitutional
instruction
under
francis
v.
franklin.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
sure.
the
jury
could
have
found
that
the
doing
of
the
unlawful
act
was
simply
the
plan
to
commit
the
robbery.
now,
the
state--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--absolutely
not.
the
state
has
attempted
to
create
a
law...
if
it
were
enough
we
would
have
felony
murder
in
south
carolina.
we
do
not.
in
fact
in
this
very
case
on
direct
appeal,
this
court--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--absolutely
not.
i
have
cited
cases
in...
for
example
the
thompson
case,
which
i've
cited
in
the
reply
brief,
is
an
armed
robbery
killing,
two
shots
through
the
head
where
there
was
an
argument
that
there
should
have
been
instruction
on
involuntary
manslaughter
because
the
defendant
claimed
the
first...
undoubtedly
an
armed
robbery
in
a
store,
rather
similar
to
this,
in
the
same
county.
the
claim
was
that
the
defendant
said
the
gun
went
off
by
accident.
he
wanted
an
involuntary
manslaughter,
which
is
a
killing,
unlawful
killing
without
malice.
the
court
said
no
because
the
second
shot
was
intentional.
had
there
been
felony
murder
the
answer
would
have
been
no
because
it
was
during
the
course
of
an
armed
robbery.
but
that
is
not
the
law
in
south
carolina,
and
the
court
cites
absolutely
no
authority
to
suggest
it
is
the
law,
and
they
can't
because
there
is
none.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no.
i'm
saying
that
the
respondents--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--oh,
yes,
absolutely.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
i
suppose,
had
there
been
a
felony
murder
rule,
this
would
have
been...
the
case
would
have
been
tried
and
decided
very
differently.
but
there
was
not.
and
indeed
on
direct
appeal
in
this
case
they
sustained,
they
said
it
was
proper
for
the
judge
to
refuse
to
give
a
felony
murder
instruction.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
justice
souter's
question
observed
that
the
trial
judge
at
one
point
in
the
charge
referred
interchangeably
to
malice
and
intent.
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
a
second
point
later
on
in
his
charge
point,
at
page
97
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
he
said,
referring
to
malice
aforethought,
he
said,
he
defined
that
or
explained
that
as
that
there
must
be
a
combination
of
a
previous
evil
intent
and
the
act.
again,
repeatedly
we
have
this
equation
in
the
charge
between
intent
and
malice.
so
i
think
the,
the
state's
efforts
to
drive
some
great
distinction
between
those
two
really
have
no
application
to
this
case
at
all.
further
increasing,
we
would
submit,
the
likelihood
that
the
jury
interpreted
the
issue,
the
presumptions
to
apply
to
yates'
mental
state
is
the
language
that
on
the
instruction
at
page
98
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
a
defendant...
this
is
during
the
discussion
of
accomplice
liability...
the
judge
says
that
the
defendant
is
not
responsible
for
a
homicide
committed
by
his
co-defendant
as
an
independent
act
growing
out
of
some
private
malice.
now
obviously
the
jury
would
have
had
to
have
interpreted
that
to
mean,
or
likely
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
well,
there
is
private
malice
and
then
there
is
something
like
shared
malice.
the
malice
that
yates,
in
engaging
in
this
dangerous,
if
it
was
a
dangerous
conspiracy
likely
to
result
in
death,
would
have...
would
have
entertained.
and
that
really
makes...
the
state
tells
you
that
there
is
no
issue
about
yates'
mental
state,
that
that
is
completely
irrelevant.
well,
that
is
simply
wrong.
there
are
two
areas
in
which
mental...
in
which
yates'
mental
state
were
crucial,
even
if
the
jury
had
focused
on
davis'
malice.
first
is
that
yates'
mental
state
is
crucial
as
to
the
scope
and
particularly
as
to
the
dangerousness,
the
likely
homicidal
nature
of
the
original
agreement.
that
is
simply
a
question
of
intent.
what
is
it
that
yates...
what
sort
of
a
crime
did
yates
intend
to
commit?
originally
yates
definitely
joined
the
issue,
that
was
the
core
of
his
defense,
which
was
we
intended
not
to
use
any
violence
at
all
and
to
retreat.
now
that's
obviously
not
the
way
it
worked
out,
but
in
order
to
convict
him
of
accomplice
liability
south
carolina
law
is
clear
that
the
agreement
which
triggers
the
vicarious
liability
must
be
an
agreement
to
commit
a
crime
which
is
life
threatening.
and
the
authority
for
that
is
state
v.
peterson,
a
case
which
i
discuss
in
the
reply
brief--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
they
probably
found
it
aided
by
the
instruction,
the
shared
malice,
if
you
will.
and
that's
why...
that's
one
of
the
several
ways
in
which
this
instruction
was
prejudicial,
because
they
could
reach
that
conclusion,
that
crucial
conclusion
in
order
to
bind
yates
to
the
homicide
of
ms.
wood
by
saying,
well,
we're
supposed
to
presume
malice
from
the
use
of
the
deadly
weapon--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--absolutely
not,
for
the
reasons
i
have
indicated,
that
it
is
not
clear...
it
requires
either
intent
to
kill
or
something
very,
very
close
to
intent
to
kill
under
south
carolina
law,
notwithstanding
that
a
felony
is
being
committed.
another
way
of
putting
it
is,
no,
we
do
not
have
felony
murder.
the
malice
must
relate
to
the
killing
itself.
obviously
any
robbery
has--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
yes,
i
think
so,
but
we
would
have
had
a
very
different
trial
then.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
would
say
that
it
was
not
harmless
error,
because
i
don't
think
that
this
jury
clearly
focused
on
davis'
mental
state
in
order
to
convict
yates.
and
you
simply...
it's
very
difficult...
it
may
be
possible
to
parse
these
instructions
through
hours
of
careful
study
to
find
a
way
in
which
the
jury
focused
on
davis'
intent,
but
i
doubt
very
seriously
that
that's
what
this
jury
did.
the
best
that
can
be
said,
i
mean,
we
argue
our
inference
and
the
state
argues
theirs,
and
we
each
say
that
it's
clear.
i
think
probably
the
fairest
way
of
looking
at
these
instructions
and
the
way
this
case
was
tried
is
that
it
was
a
confused,
tangled
mess,
and
we
really
don't
know
what
happened.
in
order
for
this
man
to
have
been
accorded
his
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right,
i
think
the
dissenting
opinion
below,
justice
toal's
opinion,
was
exactly
right
when
she
said
that
from
the
confusing
instructions
the
jury
might...
probably
concluded
that
it
was
yates'
malice
that
had
to
be
determined,
and
that
would
naturally
have
been
prejudiced
by
the...
by
the
two,
by
either
or
both
of
the
burden-shifting
jury
instructions.
that
is
the
fairest
reading.
and
i
will,
you
know,
i
will
concede
that
there
is
a
way
to
twist
and
turn
through
this
tangled
up
record
to
get
to
the
view
the
state
wants,
but
i
just
don't
think
that
there
is
any
fair
basis
for
concluding
that
that
is
what...
that
is
what
the
jury
did.
and
that
is
the
harmless
error
inquiry,
not
whether
it
was
necessary
for
the
jury
to
rely
on
the
instructions,
but
whether
this
man
was
really
accorded
a
fair
trial.
in
closing,
i
would
just
submit
that
if
ever
there
was
a
case
in
which
the
jury
trial
right,
the
right
to
have
a
person's
guilt
found
by
a
jury
of
their
peers,
and
not
by
an
appellate
court
or
even
by
this
high
court,
it
is
in
a
capital
murder
case
involving
vicarious
liability.
we
are
now
at
the
very
outer
barrier
of
the
moral
authority
of
the
criminal
law.
that's
not
to
say
that
it
raises
any
constitutional
problem
to
convict
a
person,
but
it
most
certainly
does
if
we
can't
say
that
the
facts--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--thank
you,
your
honor.
