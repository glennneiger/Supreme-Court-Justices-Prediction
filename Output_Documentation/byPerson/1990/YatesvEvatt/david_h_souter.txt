justice
souter
well,
it's
not,
but
isn't
it
also
correct,
as
your
brother
points
out
on
page
4,
that
at
another
point,
which
he
cites
to
page
96
of
the
appendix,
the
judge
said
malice
may
be
expressed
by
circumstances
which
show
directly
that
an
intent
to
kill
was
really
and
actually
entertained.
i
mean,
maybe
he
didn't
give
his
instructions
very
consistently,
and
at
one
point
he
did
seem
to
identify
them.
justice
souter
well
i
think
if
i
sit
down
quietly
with
the
instructions
i
may
be
able
to
follow
exactly
what
you
have
just
outlined.
but
isn't
the
difficulty
with
your
argument
that
if
we
have
to
engage
in
that
precise
an
analysis
of
the
instruction
in
order
to
see
it
your
way,
that
it's
very
difficult
to
conclude
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
jury
could
not
have
been
influenced
by
the
mistaken
instruction?

the
second
of
the
two
cases
is
yates
versus
evatt
89-7691.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
to
determine
whether
burden-shifting
jury
instructions
in
a
criminal
case
were
harmless
error.
the
petitioner
and
another
man
robbed
a
store
in
greenville
county,
south
carolina.
the
petitioner's
colleague
killed
a
woman
during
the
course
of
the
robbery,
and
the
petitioner
was
charged
as
an
accomplice
murder.
at
his
trial,
petitioner's
jury
was
instructed
that
in
determining
whether
the
killer
acted
with
malice
in
stabbing
the
victim.
malice
is
implied
or
presumed
from
either
the
willful,
deliberate,
or
intentional
doing
of
an
unlawful
act
or
from
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
identified
these
instructions
is
unconstitutional
burden-shifting
presumptions
under
this
court's
decisions
in
sandstrom
and
montana,
and
francis
and
franklin.
the
state
supreme
court
correctly
held
that
the
presumptions
were
nonetheless
subject
to
harmless
error
review
under
the
standard
articulated
in
chapman
and
california,
in
which
we
held
that
a
constitutional
error
is
harmless
if
it
appears
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error
complained
of
did
not
contribute
to
the
verdict
obtained.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
in
applying
the
standard
to
a
jury
instruction
raising
an
unconstitutional
presumption.
the
court
must
first
look
to
the
entire
jury
instructions
as
a
guide
to
determine
what
evidence
the
jury
actually
considered
on
the
subject
matter
addressed
by
the
presumption.
the
reviewing
court
must
then
weigh
the
probative
evidence,
probative
force
of
that
evidence,
as
against
the
force
of
the
presumption
standing
alone.
in
order
to
meet
the
test
of
harmless
error,
it
is
not
enough
that
the
jury
considered
evidence
from
which
it
could
have
reached
the
verdict
without
reliance
on
the
presumption.
the
issue
is
whether
the
jury
actually
rested
its
verdict
on
evidence
establishing
the
presumed
fact
beyond
reasonable
doubt
independently
of
the
presumption.
state
supreme
court
in
this
case
employed
a
deficient
standard
of
review.
its
stated
inquiry
was
to
determine
whether
it
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
jury
would
have
found
it
unnecessary
to
rely
on
the
erroneous
mandatory
presumption
regarding
malice.
this
inquiry
can
determine
that
the
verdict
could
have
been
the
same
without
the
presumptions
when
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
verdict
independently
of
the
presumptions'
effect.
but
it
does
not
satisfy
champan's
concerns
because
it
fails
to
determine
whether
the
jury's
verdict
did
rest
on
that
evidence
as
well
as
on
the
presumptions.
it
fails
to
determine
whether
that
evidence
was
of
such
a
compelling
force
as
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
presumptions
must
have
made
no
difference
in
reaching
the
verdict.
the
decision
below
must,
therefore,
be
reversed
on
this
ground.
because
this
case
has
already
been
to
this
court
and
had
been
remanded
twice,
once
for
harmless
error
analysis.
we
have
decided
to
make
our
own
assessment
of
the
harmlessness
of
the
jury
instructions
on
malice
and
we
hold
that
they
were
not
harmless.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined
in
part.
