justice
stevens
is
that
a
satisfactory...
i
wanted
to
ask
you
just
about
that
very
point.
they
say
that
we
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
jury
would
have
found
it
unnecessary
to
rely
on
either
presumption.
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
rely
on
it.
but
what
if
they
in
fact
did
rely
on
them?
justice
stevens
no,
i
just
want
to
focus
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
and
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off,
but
on
the
proper
test
of
harmless
error
is
it
merely
that
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
rely
on
the
instructions,
or
is
it
clear
beyond...
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
instructions
could
not
have
made
a
difference?
justice
stevens
but
that's
not
what
they
found.
they
found
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
rely
on
the
instruction.
in
other
words,
what
they
found
was
there
was
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
justify
the
finding
of
malice
without
the
instructions.
and
is
that
a
sufficient
test
of
harmless
error?
justice
stevens
well,
the
record
might
support
it,
but
they
didn't
apply
that
test.
justice
stevens
well,
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
it
would
not
be
sufficient
merely
to
conclude
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the--
justice
stevens
--jurors
to
rely
on
those
instructions?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
mr....
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
just
to
be
sure
we
don't,
don't
forget
it?
your
opponent
argues
that
the
record
was
misstated
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
both
by
saying
that
davis
lunged
at
mrs.
wood
when
there
is
no
evidence
of
that,
that
she
had
knife
wounds
in
the
plural,
and
that
there
were
brutal
multiple
stabbing.
and
the
argument
that
is
made,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that,
(a)
that
that's
an
inaccurate
statement
of
the
record,
and
i
don't
understand
you
to
challenge
that,
that
the...
and
(b)
that
if
something
that
important
is
found
erroneously
in
the
supreme
court
record,
how
can
we
be
confident
of
the
integrity
of
their
analysis
of
the
factual
record?
justice
stevens
no,
but
it
does
seem
clear
that
if
there
were
a
multiple
stabbing
your
argument
in
favor
of
harmless
error
would
be
much
stronger.
justice
stevens
and
if
they
thought
there
was
a
multiple
stabbing
it
may
well
be
that
they
came
to
a
conclusion
based
on
an
erroneous
premise.
justice
stevens
but
see,
you're
in
effect
arguing
that
there
is
a
basic
for
a
harmless
error
determination
for
reasons
other
than
those
relied
on
by
the
state
supreme
court.
