justice
kennedy
at
this
point
or
at
some
convenient
point
in
your
argument
could
you
comment
on
the
argument
of
the
amicus
that
once
evidence
of
the
use
of
the
knife
is
introduced
the
presumption
of
malice
disappears
under
state
law
in
any
event?
i
take
it
i
am
characterizing
that
argument
correctly.
