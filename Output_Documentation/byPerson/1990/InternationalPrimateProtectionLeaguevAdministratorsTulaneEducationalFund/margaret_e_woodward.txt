ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
brought
this
suit
in
state
court
under
state
law
against
nih
and
two
private
entities.
nih
argues
to
this
court
that
it
removed
to
ensure
that
its
federal
defenses
would
have
a
fair
forum
in
federal
district
court.
nih
passes
very
quickly
over
the
fact
that
its
would-be
protector,
the
federal
district
court,
quickly
dismissed
and
rejected
its
vaunted
federal
defenses.
what
remained
in
this
case
then
were
issues
of
state
law,
a
serious
question
whether
nih,
the
removing
party,
had
any
legal
interest
in
this
case
whatsoever,
and
article
iii
standing
requirements
that
applied
in
federal
court
but
which
would
not
have
applied
in
state
court,
the
forum
of
choice
by
petitioners.
on
a
questionable
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
ordered
the
case
dismissed.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
try
to
explain
to
you
what
i
myself
have
never
understood.
when
this--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--when
this
case
was
first
removed
to
federal
court,
nih
accepted
service.
nih
accepted
the
issuance
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
it.
that
restraining
order
had
not
been
issued
by
the
state
court.
we
had
not
had
nih
served
in
state
court,
because
we
questioned
even
at
that
time
nih's
interest
in
the
case.
we
immediately
moved
for
remand,
both
on
the
issue
on
which
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
and
on
the
questionable
interest
of
nih
in
the
case.
the
district
court
was
initially
skeptical.
but
after
nih
was
found
out
misrepresenting
the
facts
of
its
involvement
to
that
court,
she
ordered
discovery
on
the
nih's
interest
in
that
case
and
at
the
same
time
heard
two
successive
motions
to
dismiss.
nih,
following
the
denial
of
those
motions
to
dismiss,
moved
for
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
yes,
your
honor,
we
did
oppose
the
motion
to
dismiss.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
mr.
chief
justice,
nih
takes
the
position
that
our
having
named
them
as
a
party
in
this
suit
is
an
unretractable
admission
against
interest.
it
was
a
pleading
that
was
drafted
in
haste.
it
was
a
pleading
which
we
ourselves
questioned
and
which
we
immediately
set
about
to
conduct
discovery
on.
that
discovery
was
ordered
by
the
district
court,
but
the
discovery
was
never
concluded,
because
nih,
which
not
only
resisted
any
hearing
on
the
merits
of
this
case,
but
also
resisted
any
inquiry
into
its
interest
in
this
case,
refused
to
comply
with
discovery.
and
after
discovery
had
been
ordered,
nih
brought
the
appeal.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
yes,
your
honor.
but
we--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--that's
correct.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
your
honor,
we
notified
the
district
court
immediately.
we
had
not
served
nih.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
it
was
nih's
position
that
it
would
intervene
as
an
indispensable
party
and
it
was
addressing
that
issue
as
well
as
our
questioning
of
their
interest
in
this
case.
but
the
court
insisted
the
discovery
go
forward.
but
that
discovery
was
forestalled
by
nih's
taking
of
an
improper
appeal
from
the
denial
of
its
motion
to
dismiss.
that...
the
denial
was
not
certified
by
the
district
court.
it
was
clearly
improper.
and
as
a
companion--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--it
goes
further
than
that.
as
a
companion
to
that
notice
of
appeal,
the
respondents
filed
a
motion
for
a
stay
in
the
district
court.
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
a
stay,
we
urged
that
the
appeal
was
improper,
that
the
request
for
a
stay
was
improper--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--a
stay
of
the
temporary
restraining
order,
and
more
pertinently
at
that
time,
a
stay
of
the
discovery
on
nih's
interest
in
the
case
that
had
been
ordered
by
the
district
court.
we
filed
our
opposition
urging
that
the
appeal
was
improper.
and
on
the
night
before
the
motion
for
stay
was
to
be
heard,
nih
filed
a
motion
for
indicative
ruling,
with
which
this
court
may
be
familiar
but
of
which
i
have
never
heard
and
have
found
no
reference
to
in
any
legal
periodical
or
case.
the
district
court
entertained
that
motion
for
indicative
ruling
on
the
morning
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
stay.
i
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
respond,
but
it
was
my
argument
to
the
court
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
that
motion.
the
district
court--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--we
are,
your
honor,
and...
and
time
is
very
short
here.
we
did
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
in
the
fifth
circuit.
our
writ
for
certiorari
of
course
is
premised
on
an
assumption
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
have
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
all...
albeit
we
questioned
that
jurisdiction
as
an
issue
for
the
court
to
address.
and
if
the
court
does
find
that
jurisdiction
did
not
lie
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
appropriate
remedy
we
contend
would
be
for
this
court
to
vacate
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
appropriate
[inaudible].
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
this
is
one
of
the
interesting
ironies
of
the
case,
your
honor.
article--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--article
iii
standing
requirements
only
apply,
of
course,
in
federal
court.
and
presupposed--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--yes,
your--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--the
federal
courts
have
determined
that
we
have
no
standing
and
this
court
did
not
grant
writs
on
that
question,
although
we
attempted
to
bring
it
up.
so
that
is
not
squarely
before
you,
but
it
is
also
a
jurisdictional
issue
on
which
the
court
has
granted
writs
whether
or
not
section
1442(a)
permits
removal
by
a
federal
agency
to
a
federal
district
court.
obviously,
if
the
removal
was
improper
then
it
is
improper
for
article
iii
standing
requirements
to
be
imposed
on
these
petitioners
who
have
brought
a
state
claim.
and
because
both
are
jurisdictional
questions,
in
effect,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
threshold
jurisdictional
question
is
the
jurisdictional
question
of
whether
removal
was
proper
in
the
first
place.
one
of
the
greatest
injustices
in
this
case
is
that,
as
the
fifth
circuit
analyzed
it,
it
could
reach
the
standing
issue
first
and
did
reach
the
standing
issue
first.
and
what
it
found...
because
it
found
that
petitioners
lacked
standing...
was
that
not
only
could
petitioners'
claims
not
receive
a
hearing
in
federal
court,
but
also
the
federal
defenses,
which
supposedly
under
mesa
are
a
prerequisite
to
the
removal,
were
not
entitled
to
any
consideration.
so
untested
in
this
court
are
the
claims
and
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
the
court's
imposing
article
iii
standing
requirements.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
your
honor,
i
would
be
happier
if
i
were
on
that
kind
of
treadmill.
what
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
was
that
there
was
an
absolute
right
of
removal
and
that
our
case
was
not
to
be
remanded
as
we
urged
even
against
the
private
entities
ibr
and
tulane
university...
but
that
the
case
was
to
be
dismissed
with
prejudice
as
a
whole
with
no
hearing
in
any
court
on
any
issue.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
an
affront
not
only
to
the
constitution
and
to
justice
between
the
litigants
but
to
comity,
because
the
state
courts
had
an
interest
here.
and
the
state
of
louisiana
had
an
interest
in
seeing
its
public
policy
enforced
through
the
claims
that
were
brought
by
these
petitioners.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
your
honor--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--i
would
have
no
objection
to--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--i
would
have
no
problem
with
that,
but
that
is
a
very
large
assumption.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
i'm
sure
that
assumption
is
not
correct.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
that's
not
the
premise
with
which
i'm
disagreeing.
you
said,
assuming
that
removal
was
permissible
in
this
case,
and
i
do
not
assume
that
removal
in
this
case--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--i
agree
with
that.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
but
to
get
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
or
not
section
1442(a)
does
permit
removal
by
a
federal
agency...
i
believe
that
the
court
yesterday
announced
the
rule
that
decides
this
case
in
west
virginia
university
hospitals
v.
casey
when
it
says
that
the
best
evidence
of
congressional
purpose
is
the
statutory
text
adopted
by
both
houses
of
congress.
and
goes
on
to
say,
whereas
here
the
statute's
language
was
plain,
the
sole
function
of
the
court
is
to
enforce
it
according
to
its
terms.
in
this
case,
the
statutory
language
is
plain.
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
me
and
to
a
majority
of
courts
until
it
was
translated
from
the
english
into
a
foreign
legalese
by
these
respondents.
the
statute
is
entitled,
federal
officers
sued
or
prosecuted.
it
commences
by
saying,
"a
civil
action
against
any
of
the
following
persons
may
be
removed
by
them.
"
as
respondents
have
conceded
quite
candidly
in
their
brief,
"persons"
is
normally
read
to
exclude
reference
to
the
sovereign.
that's
the
first
obstacle
they
face.
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
"any
officer
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof.
"
comma...
and
the
punctuation
serves
a
useful
function
in
this
statute.
it
does
not
say
as
they
would
read
it,
"any
officer
of
the
united
states,
or
any
agency
thereof,
or
person
acting
under
him.
"
it's
to
be
read
together...
"any
officer
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof,
or
person
acting
under
him.
"
nih
tells
us
that
"him"
can
sometimes
mean
"it",
"them",
the
"sovereign".
that's
certainly
true,
but
him
in
ordinary
english
means
him.
for
any
act
of...
under
collor
of
such
office--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--yes,
your
honor,
to
be
sure.
[laughter]
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
maybe
"it",
and
in
some
cases,
"it".
the
problem
that
they
confronted
in
this
case
is
that
in
their
masterful
brief,
they
have
cited
to
this
court
cases
that
say,
you
may
disregard
the
statutory
title.
they
have
cited
cases
that
say
you
may
disregard
the
syntax.
they
have
cited
cases
that
say
you
may
disregard
the
normal
reading
of
"person"
or
you
may
disregard
the
meaning
of
the
word
"him".
however,
they
have
cited
to
not
a
single
case
that
says
you
may
disregard
the
statutory
title
and
the
common
usage
of
"person"
and
the
common
meaning
of
"him"
and
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
and
the
majority
of
the
courts
who
have
properly
read
this
statute,
in
order
to
embark
upon
a
protectionist
fervor
of
their
own
which
was
not
shared
by
congress
when
it
enacted
this
statute.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
it
goes
way
back.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
that--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--no,
your
honor.
because
by
1948
when
this
judiciary
code
was
passed
into
law,
there
were
many,
many,
many
agencies.
the
burr
case
had
been
decided
in
1940.
keifer
&
keifer
had
been
decided
in
1939.
the
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
had
already
been
construed
by
the
court
to
permit
the
direct
right
of
action
against
agencies.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
many,
many,
many
real
agencies
have
been
created
during
the
period
immediately
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
act.
this
was
the
new
deal
and
professor
davis--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--sued
as
such
under
reifer
and
burr.
and
congress
clearly
averted
to
the
fact
that
agencies
would
be
in
court
as
litigants,
because
listen
to
what
they
did
in
another
section
of
the
judicial
code,
enacted
in
the
same
year.
they
held,
without
any
particular
difficulty
in
the
english
language,
at
28
u.s.c.
section
1345,
"with
respect
to
actions
brought
by
agencies,
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
all
actions
commenced
by
the
united
states
or
by
any
agency
or
officer
thereof.
"
what
could
be
simpler?
and
yet
respondents
would
have
you
believe
that
when
it
came
to
enacting
a
section
placed
only
a
few
statutory
provisions
beyond,
congress
was
tripping
over
its
tongue
and
did
not
know
how
to
speak.
but
congress's
intent
is
clear
enough,
not
only
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
in
the
revisor's
notes
when
it
states
very
briefly,
this
statute
had
gone
back
a
long
way...
back
to
reconstruction
and
even
before.
there
had
been
in
times
of
national
crisis
very
limited
statutes
enacted
to
protect
officers
against
actions
in
hostile
state
courts
starting
with
the
new
england
states'
resistance
to
the
trade
embargo
against
england,
and
again
during
the
civil
way,
other
statutes.
in
1948,
congress
decided
to
broaden
that
protection
to
all
officers,
but
it
explained
in
the
revisor's
notes,
"the
revised
subsection
(a)(1)
is
extended
to
apply
to
all
officers
and
employees
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof.
"
respondents
read
this
language
to
mirror
the
same
ambiguity
that
they
attempt
to
read
into
the
language
of
the
statute.
but
there
are
important
distinctions
in
the
notes
and
the
statutory
language.
the
statutory
language
refers
to
a
right
of
removal
by
any
officer
of
the
united
states
or
any
agent
thereof
or
person
acting
under
him.
here
they
explain
exactly
what
the
change
is.
we're
now
broadening
this
to
apply
to
all
officers
and
employees
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof...
not
all
agencies...
all
officers.
this
note
is
important,
too,
because
respondents
would
take
either
of
two
routes
to
find
a
right
of
agency
removal.
the
first
is
by
reading
ambiguity
into
the
statutory
language.
and
the
second
is
by
construing
this
language
"or
person
acting
under
him"
to
mean
anyone...
any
agency,
any
entity,
any
anything...
operating
under
any
officer
of
the
united
states,
tracing
all
the
way
up
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
and
the
reason
why
it
is
very
important
for
this
court
to
attend
to
that
argument
is
that
respondents,
nih,
tulane,
and
ibr
are...
they
all
contend
that
tulane
also
would
be
a
person
acting
under
an
officer
and
entitled
to
a
move
to
federal
court.
by
that
construction,
if
tulane
is
an
entity
because
it
has
the
nih's
vague
approval
of
what
it's
doing
in
this
case,
then
anyone
who
has
spent
$1
of
federal
money
or
has
the
approval
of
any
federal
agency
or
officer
for
its
actions
would
be
entitled
to
a
move
to
federal
court.
and
in
that
case,
the
mesa
requirement
that
there
be
a
federal
defense
poses
no
obstacle
at
all
because
all
of
these
respondents
say
that
they
do
indeed
have
a
federal
defense.
and
that
federal
defense
is
sovereign
immunity
because
what
they
contend
we
are
attempting
to
do
here
is
interfere
with
the
actions
of
the
federal
government
which
have
been
expressed
in
some
terms
about
which
we
are
not
entitled
to
receive
discovery
but
which
they
say...
and
this
court
is
instructed
to
accept
as
fact...
have
something
to
do
with
science
which
is
not
to
be
tampered
with
by
us--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--your
honor,
it
can,
but
to
construe
"person"
to
include
the
sovereign
as
they
have
done,
is
something
more.
and
referring
back
to
the
statutory
notes,
the
revisors
explained
that
this
was
intended
to
apply
to
all
officers
and
employees.
tulane
is
not
an
employee.
the
wire
tappers
in
the
camacho
case
who
were
sued
for
a
violation
of
puerto
rico
law
were
not
officers
or
employees
either.
there
is
almost
no
limit
to
the
number
of
cases
that
could
be
brought
in
federal
court
if
this
is
given
so
broad
a
construction.
and
what
it
essentially
works
is
an
end
run
against
the
long-established
principle
that
issues
of
federal
immunity
can
be
capably
decided
in
state
court.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
i
just
think
that's
far
too
broad.
and
that's...
that's
a
breadth
of
construction
that
has
been
applied
to
this
statute
by
many,
many
courts.
and
it
has
been
applied
drawing
on
the
same
language
that
was
handed
down
from
tennessee
v.
davis
that
is
repeated
at
every
place
in
respondents'
brief
that
they
could
find
a
place
to
put
it.
the
language
about
hostile
state
courts,
about
what
is
to
become
of
the
state
government
if
it
is
placed
at
the
mercy
of
hostile
state
courts.
that
language
has
no
real
currency
today.
and
it's
clear
also
from
notes
in
the
revisions
to
the
judiciary--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--that
state
courts
are
hostile
to
the
federal
government
and
that
federal
defenses
cannot
be
safely
entrusted
to
the
state
courts.
i
do
not
believe
that--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--no,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
here
between
an
officer
and
an
agency.
and
i
think
it's
a
logical
extension.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
i
believe
that
that
part
of
the
removal
statute
is
somewhat
antiquated.
to
me
it
is.
but
that
is
a
decision
that
congress
has
made,
and
the
question
here
is
whether
it's
going
to
be
extended.
first
of
all,
it
can't
be
extended
judicially
because
congress
has
not
expressed
any
intention
to
do
that.
and
to
the
contrary,
congress
clearly
demonstrated
in
1948
that
it
was
not
operating
from
these
sorts
of
protectionist
notions.
in
the
revisions,
in
the
revisors'
notes
to
section
1441,
congress
explained...
in
explaining
its
having
dropped
from
the
removal
statute
the
right
to
remove
in
all
diversity
cases.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
this
is
in
the
house
report,
volume
8,
number
308,
at
page
a133.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
the
revisors'
notes.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
your
honor,
i
don't
know
who
the
revisor
is.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
these
are
very
brief.
i
looked
at
them
in
the
library
of
congress.
they're
entitled,
revisors'
notes,
and
that's
the
citation
where
they
can
be
found.
they're
also
cited
in
the
parties'
briefs.
in
that
house
report
it
says,
"all
the
provisions
with
reference
to
removal
of
controversies
between
citizens
of
different
states
because
of
inability
from
prejudice
or
local
influence
to
obtain
justice,
have
been
discarded.
"
"these
provisions,
borne
of
the
bitter
sectional
feelings
engendered
by
the
civil
war
and
the
reconstruction
period
have
no
place
in
the
jurisprudence
of
a
nation
since
united
by
three
wars
against
foreign
powers.
"
"indeed,
the
practice
of
removal
prejudice
or
local
influence
has
not
been
much
employed
in
recent
years.
"
and
those
remarks
have
equal
validity
in
connection
with
this
case.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
kennedy,
i
do
not
believe
tarbell's
case
stands
for
that
proposition.
there
is
a
very
fine
law
review
article
published
in
the
1966
yale
law
journal
that
explains
that
tarbell's
case
cannot
be
extended
to
so
hold
and
that
would
be
our
position
in
this
case.
but
i
think
we're
a
long
way
from
that
discussion.
and
on
the
subject
of
remand,
i
think
this
court
should
also
take
a
look
at
the
new
judiciary
reform
act
which
makes
some
modest
adjustments
to
section
1441(c)
and
strikes
out
the
language,
"remand
all
matters
not
otherwise
within
its
original
jurisdiction.
"
and
inserts
in
lieu
thereof,
"may
remand
all
matters
in
which
state
law
predominates.
"
that
may
have
been
enacted
to
get
around
the
problems
confronted
by
this
court
in
carnegie
mellon
university
v.
cohelm.
but
whether
or
not
i
think
it
was
intended
to
do
that,
i
think
it
does
have
some
direct
application
to--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--it
does
not,
your
honor.
i
only
just
discovered
this.
it's
104,
statute
5114.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
i'd
be
glad
to.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
and
to
revisit
the
question
that
you
addressed,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
tulane's
interest
in
this
case.
it's
all
very
interesting
that
there
is
an
agreement...
a
letter
agreement...
between
nih
and
tulane
relating
to
the
issue
of
custody
of
these
monkeys.
but
that
skips
a
very
important
first
step,
and
that
is
what
is
nih's
interest
in
these
monkeys
other
than
a
political
interest.
nih
is
not
the
owner
of
these
monkeys.
ibr
is
the
owner
of
these
monkeys.
tulane
has
physical
custody
of
the
monkeys.
nih
initially
urged
to
the
district
court
that
it's
custody--
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
--your
honor,
we
thought
they
were
an
interested
party
and
we
named
them
as
an
interested
party.
it
was
nih
which
jumped
in
with
both
feet,
removed
to
federal
court,
accepted
service
and
suggested
to
the
district
court
that
it
would
accept
a
tro
issued
against
it,
the
nih,
which
i
was
even
requesting
because
i
was
satisfied
that
the
temporary
restraining
order
issued
against
tulane
gave
us
all
the
protection
that
we
were
seeking
in
this
case.
the
state
court
never
issued
an
injunction
against
the
nih.
the
nih
offered
to
be
sued,
to
be
enjoined,
and
it
was
over
our
opposition
that
we
did
not
believe
that
they
had
that
kind
of
interest
in
this
case.
and
i
find
it
very
peculiar
that
nih
should
try
to
trump
us
in
standing
when
its
own
interest
has
been
questioned
by
the
court
and
has
never
been
determined.
that's
the
fundamental
injustice.
and
i
also
think
that
it's
fundamentally
unfair
to
read
these
statutes
broadly
to
confer
federal
jurisdiction.
as
this
court
is
well
aware
federal
courts
are,
by
origin
and
design,
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
and
it
is
not
only
unfair
but
unconstitutional
for
the
federal
courts
to
exercise
jurisdiction
and
in
an
area
where
state
law
predominates,
state
issues
are
paramount,
and
the
federal
interest
has
not
even
been
tested.
for
article
iii
standing
to
apply
so
that
the
federal
interest
cannot
even
be
plumbed
in
the
district
court
to
which
they
have
removed
is
not
an
appropriate
exercise
of
jurisdiction.
ms.
margaret
e.
woodward
thank
you,
your
honor.
