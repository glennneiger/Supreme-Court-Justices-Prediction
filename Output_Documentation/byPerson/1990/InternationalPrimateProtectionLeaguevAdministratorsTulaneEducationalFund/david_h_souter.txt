mr.
seamon,
may
i
go
back
to
the
text
for
a
moment
on
a
phrase
that
hasn't
been
discussed.
that
is
at
the
point
at
which
subsection
1
moves
from
a
description
of
persons
to
a
description
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
action.
and
the
phrase
is...
that
i'm
concerned
with...
is
"for
any
act
under
color
of
such
office.
"
would
you
agree
that
that
phrase
would
refer
only
to
the
acts
of
an
officer
rather
than
the
acts
taken
in
the
name
of
an
agency?
justice
souter
the
agency
acts
under
color
in
the
same
sense
that
an
individual
acts
under
color?
justice
souter
do
you
have
any
examples
of
identical
or
substantially
identical
usage
in
other
statutes
that...
that
has
been
held
to
refer
to
agencies
rather
than
to
officers
acting
under
color?
justice
souter
so
that
so
far
as
you
know,
this
would...
this
would
be
a
unique
example
of
that
usage,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you?
justice
souter
but
how...
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off,
but
how
does
that
relate
directly
to
the
question
whether
the
concept
of
acting
under
color
of
office
is
a
concept
which
can
be
associated
with
the
agency
rather
than
with
the
individual?
