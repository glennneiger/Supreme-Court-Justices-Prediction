mr.
richard
h.
seamon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1442(a)(1)
of
title
28
authorizes
removal
by,
quote,
"any
officer
of
the
united
states
and
any
agency
thereof
or
person
acting
under
him
for
any
act
under
color
of
such
office.
"
nih
was
authorized
to
remove
this
action
both
because
it
is
an
agency
of
the
united
states,
and
in
the
alternative,
because
it
is
a
person
acting
under
a
federal
officer,
namely
the
director
of
nih
as
well
as
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
we
accordingly
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
nih
was
authorized
to
remove
this
case
as
a
federal
agency
under
the
first
clause
of
section
1342(a)(1).
we
read
the
first
clause
to
authorize
removal
either
by
an
officer
of
the
united
states
or
an
agency
of
the
united
states.
we
recognize
that
our
reading
of
the
first
clause
is
not
the
only
plausible
one.
the
clause
could
be
read,
as
petitioners
do,
to
allow
removal
by
officers
of
the
united
states
and
officers
of
agencies
of
the
united
states.
the
problem
with
this
reading
is
that
all
officers
of
agencies
of
the
united
states
are
officers
of
the
united
states.
petitioners'
reading
of
the
first
clause
therefore
renders
the
phrase
"any
agency
thereof"
superfluous.
we
recognize--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--this
court
hasn't
often
addressed
the
phrase
"officer
of
the
united
states".
but
one
case
in
which
it
did
is
united
states
v.
handy,
in
124
u.s.
and
there
it
recognized
that
there
is
the
strict
constitutional
meaning
of
officer
of
the
united
states
which
is
relatively
restricted.
but
there's
also
a
more
popular
signification
of
the
term
and
that
can
mean
officers
of
various
lower
departments,
other
than
the
departments
in
the
executive
branch.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it's--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it's
plausible,
and
we
concede
that.
but
in
a
way
that's
beside
the
point
of
the
fact
that
petitioners
have
to
resort
to
speculation
about
what
might
have
been
on
congress'
mind
when
it
drafted
this
statute.
the
extent
that
they
have
to
kind
of
read
congress'
mind,
they
can't
lay
a
claim
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
which
is
what
they
purport
to
do.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
actually,
in
some
of
the
early...
"officers
of
the
united
states"
has
been
a
phrase
employed
from
early
times,
although
in
the
removal
provisions
that
was
not
the
invariable
phrase.
some
of
the
earlier
provisions
talk
about
officers
acting
under
the
revenue
laws.
they
speak
in
terms
of
the
laws
that
the
officers
are
carrying
out.
i
believe
that
"officers
of
the
united
states"
was
relatively
recent
vintage
in
the
context
of
the
broader
history
of
these
removal
provisions.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
also
plausible,
although
petitioners
haven't
raised
that
argument.
our
point
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
plausible
explanations
about
what
may
have
been
on
congress'
mind
when
it
drafted
this
language.
but
the
point
is
that
it's
all
speculation.
and
petitioners
couch
their
whole
argument--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
concede
that
the
statutory
language
is...
can
be
read
to
draw
some
kind
of
distinction.
our
point
is
more
limited
which
is
that
it
is
not
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
petitioners'
reading
is
not
compelled
under
the
language
alone.
you
have
to
resort
among
other
things
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
to
discern
what
congress'
intent
is.
and
when
you
have
to
go
those
further
stages,
our
position
is
that
our
reading
of
the...
both
clauses
of
1442(a)(1)
is
just
as
reasonable
as
petitioners'
is.
they
cannot
lay
claim
to
claiming--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--no.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
first,
let
me
clarify.
our
position
is
that
officers
of
agencies
is
a
subset,
wholly
included
within
the
larger
set
officers
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
believe
it
is
among
other
reasons
because
subsections
(a)(2)
through
(a)(4)
speak
in
terms
of
officers
of
the
house
and
congress,
officers
of
the
court.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
mesa
v.
arizona,
these
are...
are
essentially
redundant
provisions.
they
are
now
encompassed
within
the
broader
meaning
of
subsection
(a)(1).
in
other
words,
we
would
say
officers
of
the
court
are
officers
of
the
united
states,
officers
of
the--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
believe
that
members
of
the
bar
would
be
officers
of
the
court.
they're
denominated
as
such
when
they--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
can
tell
from
the
face
of
the
statute
that
officers
of
agencies
in
our
view
are
officers
of
the
united
states.
again,
our
point
on--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
didn't
raise
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defense
in
the
state
court
primarily
because
when...
when
you
are
sued
in
state
court,
as
nih
was,
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
essentially
is
remove.
if
you're
going
to
remove,
you
have
only
30
days.
and
that
has
to
be
the
first
thing
you
do.
so
if
it's
not
raised
until
the
case
was--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--in
no
sense.
i--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it's
the
filing
of
a
petition
and
that
effects
the
removal
of
the
case.
at
the
district
court
level,
nih
filed
motions
to
dismiss
that
included
a
defense
based
on
sovereign
immunity
as
well
as
the
supremacy
clause,
and
we
made
a
preemption
argument
in
the
district
court
as
well.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
don't
believe
that
remand
was
appropriate
in
this
case,
because
petitioners
lack
standing.
the
fifth
circuit,
having
determined
that
the
case
was
properly
removed,
also
held
that
petitioners
lacked
standing.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
that's
the
language
of
section
1447(c).
under
these
circumstances,
plausibly
the
court
could
have
remanded
but
it
would
have
been
futile
because
petitioners
had
lost.
it
had
been
established
that
nih
had
a
right
to
be
sued
in
federal
court.
they
had
a
right
to
be
sued
by
plaintiffs
with...
petitioners
with
article
iii
standing.
petitioners
didn't
have
article
iii
standing.
they
lost.
the
case
was
over.
they
couldn't
have
done
anything
in
state
court
had
the
case
been
remanded
to
that...
to
that...
to
that
court.
we
note
that
the--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
would
take
the
position
that
they
cannot
refile
this
suit
simply
omitting
nih
and
any
other
federal
entity
from
their...
from
their
complaint
and
their
allegations.
for
one
thing,
i
don't
see
how
they
would
draft
a
complaint
without
reference
to
the
federal
entities
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that...
that
would
be...
if
the
fifth
circuit,
having
ruled
on
both
standing
and
removal,
means
that
they
can't
nih
either
in
federal
court
or
state
court.
that
would
be
our
position.
and
just
to
return
to
a
point
i
was
making
just
a
moment
ago,
our
position
would
be
that
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
disposition...
the
treatment
of
the
monkeys...
nih
or
at
least
its
director
is
an
indispensable
party
to
any
proceedings.
although
theoretically
petitioners
could
return
to
state
court
and
file
a
new
suit
and
this
time
omit
any
reference
to
nih,
nih
or
directors
would
have
to
be
included
in
that
suit,
and
in
fact
it
would
seek
to
intervene.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
correct.
and
louisiana
appears
to
follow
essentially
the
same
doctrine
as
the
federal
courts
do.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no,
we
wouldn't
agree.
we
would
say
that
every
agency,
just
like
every
officer,
has
an
office,
and
the
office
is
defined
by
the
agency--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right,
and
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeds
its
officers
defined
by
statute,
it
is...
it
is
subject
to
suit.
so,
again,
we
do
not
agree
that
office
only
refer
to
the
officer,
but
also
the
agency.
and
in
part
i
am
relying
on
black's
law
dictionary
for
that.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
again,
as
far
as
i
know,
that...
that's
correct.
i
would
just
point
out
that
the
constitution
speaks
in
terms
of
the
office
of
the
president.
but
the...
but
the
definition
of
"office"
has
broader
implications
as
well.
black's
law
dictionary,
at
any
rate,
defines
"office"
without
regard
to
the
individuals...
officers.
it
has
a
broader
meaning
and
it
means...
it's
defined
as
a
right
and
corresponding
duty
to
exercise
of
public
trust.
i'm
reading
selectively
here,
of
course.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
our
position
would
be
that
an
agency...
any
time
an
agency
takes
or
purports
to
be
an
agency
action,
such
as
the
promulgation
of
regulations
[inaudible]
informal
adjudication,
that
it
is
acting
under
the
color
of
its
office.
it
is
acting...
and
that
means
within
the
parameters
of
its
statutes
creating
its
mandate.
again,
we
believe
that
the
first
clause
can
be
plausibly
read
in
more
than
one
way.
and
our
limited
point
about
the
competing
interpretations
before
the
court
is
simply
that
petitioners
can't
lay
claim
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
text
because
of
the
problem
of
officers
of
agencies
in--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
define
person
to
include
natural
persons,
but
not
only
natural
persons,
also
agencies
and
corporations
and
associations.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
tulane
would
be
entitled
to
remove
and
indeed
intends
to
remove
if
this
case
is
remanded
as
a
person
acting
under
a
federal
officer
and
specifically
the
acting
director
of
nih
who
signed
the
letter
of
agreement
with
tulane.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
correct.
and
that
is
not
a
remarkable
reading,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
on
many
occasions,
this
court
has
interpreted
the
word
person
to
include
sovereign
bodies...
state
corporations,
states
themselves.
and
lower
courts
have
done
the
same
thing.
in
connection
with
this,
we
point
out
that
the
word
persons
also
used
in
the
subsection
(a)(2)
where
it
plainly
can't
be
limited
to
natural
persons.
subsection
(a)(2)
refers
to
persons
holding
land
under
a
federal
officer.
and
we
believe
it
is
plain
on
the...
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
the
word
(a)(2)
clearly
includes
corporations
and
other
entities
capable
of
holding
property.
and
our
position
is
that
the
word
person
can't
have
a
more
narrower
meaning
for
(a)(1)
than
it
does
for
(a)(2),
where
it's
clearly
not
limited
to
individuals
as
petitioners
argue.
we
do
believe
that
it's
consistent,
not
withstanding
petitioners'
argument
to
the
contrary,
for
entities
like
tulane
to
remove
as
persons
acting
under
a
federal
officer.
in
connection
with
this,
it's
helpful
to
consider
the
court's
opinion
in
the
mayor
v.
cooper.
it's
a
very
old
case.
it's
in
73
u.s.
but
in
that
case,
the
action
was...
concerned
the
governing
body
of
nashville,
tennessee.
they
clearly
were
not
federal
employees,
but
they
were
acting
under
the
direction
of
a
military
officer.
this
was
a
case
that
arose
in
the
wake
of
the
civil
war.
we
think
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
mayor
versus
cooper,
although
a
concern
in
earlier
provision
to
interpret
section
1442(a)
not
to
be
limited
to
federal
employees
but
also
to
include
their
employers--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--there
are
two
justifications,
i'm
sorry
to
say
only
one
of
which
is
in
the
record.
one
is
the
letter
of
agreement
between
the
acting
director
of
tulane
and
tulane
university's
medical
school
that
provides
for
tulane's
acting
as
an
assistant
to
nih.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
it
was
also
signed
by
the
chancellor
of
the
medical
school
who
is...
oversees
the
delta
center.
there's
been
subsequent
correspondence,
and
i'm
informed
that
there
is
a
more
formal
contract
between
nih
and
tulane.
it
works
out
the
details
of
reimbursement
and
care
of
the
monkeys.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
correct.
we
would
go
on
to--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--under
our
reading
it
could
be...
it
could
be
nih,
but
it
clearly
also
is
the
acting
director.
he
signed
the
letter
that
was
also
signed
by
the
chancellor.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
other
courts
have
proceeded
under
the...
under
the
"person
acting
under
him"
clause
to
include
agencies.
actually,
one
earlier
fifth
circuit
decision
concerning
the
national
bank
of
texas
from
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
that
clause.
but
it
appears
that
the...
presently
fifth
circuit
precedent
relies
on
the
first.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it...
the
standing
discussion
is
first
in
its
opinion.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
sorry.
i'm
misunderstanding
your
question.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
oh,
certainly
so.
as
we
discussed
in--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--absolutely.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
that's
why
we
believe
the
fifth
circuit
disposed
of
this
case
properly
when
it
dismissed
with
prejudice.
petitioners
have
no
right
to
be
back
in
state
court
suing
nih
or
any
of
the
other
defendants
presently
named
in
this
case.
and
i
would
point
out
that,
although
petitioners
talk
about
the
injustice
that
seems
to
have
been
visited
on
them,
it
presupposes
the
question
that's
before
the
court.
if
nih
had
a
right
to
remove
this
case,
it
had
a
right
to
be
sued
by
petitioners
with
article
iii
standing.
congress
made
the
judgment
in
section
1442(a)
that
officers...
and
we
would
submit
agencies...
have
a
right
to
go
to
federal
court
rather
than
to
have...
rather
than
to
be
sued
in
state
court
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
think
it
goes
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
would--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
believe
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
unless
it
would
be
futile
to
do
so.
and
that
this
is
one
of
those
limited
circumstances
when
remand
would
be
futile
because
petitioners
don't
have
a
right
to
do
anything
in
state
court.
we
recognize
that
in
this
area,
too,
there
is
some
tension
with
the
language.
we
take
the
position
that
the
first
circuit
did,
which
addressed
this
question
in
a
case
entitled,
maine
v.
maine
commissioner
of
human
resources.
i'm
not
sure
it's
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs.
it's
a
recent
case,
876
f.
2d.
and
they
held
precisely
on
the
position
we're
taking
that
when
remand
would
clearly
be
futile--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
includes
those,
but
it
also
includes
defects
in
standing.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no
authority
immediately
comes
to
mind.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
because
my
experience
is
that
you
would
seek
to
dismiss
a
case
on
standing
grounds
under
12...
rule
12(b)(6).
it's
not--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
occurs
to
me
that
there
is
authority
in
terms
of...
no,
i'm
sorry,
no
case
is
coming
to
mind.
but
that's
correct
that
standing
goes
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
as
do
other
defenses
raised
in
this
case
such
as
sovereign
immunity
and
the
fact
that
nih
was--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
take
the
position
that
sovereign
immunity
also
goes
to
jurisdiction,
so--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
true.
and
more
generally
jurisdiction
is
a
difficult
concept
because
there
are
lots
of
different
kinds
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
and
in
a
way,
for
purposes
of
deciding
the
issue
before
this
court,
it
just
suffices
that
clearly
nih's
defenses
raised
in
the
district
court
and
again
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
clearly
colorable
federal
defenses
for
purposes
of
mesa.
the
merits,
you
know,
were
not
litigated
before
the
court
of
appeals,
although
they
were
raised
there.
but
they
don't
have
to
be.
as
the
court
indicated
in
willingham,
you
do
not
have
to
win
your
immunity
defense
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
remove.
the
question
here
is
nih's
right
to
be
in
federal
court
to
litigate
these
defenses.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
have
not
considered
that
question
before.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that
may
well
be.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
may
be...
it
may
be
appropriate
under
certain
circumstances
to
remand
to
state
court,
for
example,
to
determine
whether
a
federal
entity
is
an
indispensable
party
under
the
state
law.
it's...
it's
a...
it
is
a
difficult
question.
i
don't
believe
it's
necessarily
before
the
court
because
federal
rule
81(c)
also
provides
that
the
federal
rules
govern
in
removed
cases.
so
there
are
some
technical
and
admittedly
difficult
questions
where
the
state
rules
end
and
federal
rules
pick
up.
in
my
remaining
time
i
would
just
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
many
ways,
although
beyond
the
difficult
questions
of
jurisdiction,
the
courts
shouldn't
forget
about
the
context
in
which
this
case
has
arisen.
petitioners
named
nih
as
the
only
federal
defendant
in
this
case
and
that
was
in
paragraph
4
of
their
complaint,
which
begins
on
page
30
of
the
petition.
in
paragraph
6
they
expressly
ask
for
an
injunction
against
both
nih,
its
officers,
agents,
employees,
and
representatives.
this
is
really
a
suit
against
both
officers
and
the
agency.
and
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
hold
that
merely
because
of
the
way
they
pleaded
this
case
that
nih
can't
remove.
we
doubt
and
we
think
it's
absurd
to
attribute
that
kind
of
intention
to
congress.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
not
sure
that...
i
think
that,
assuming
that
you
were
willing
to
proceed
as
petitioners
have
in
this
case,
is
that
you
simply...
you
file
to
execute
under
whatever
applicable
state
laws
there
are.
there's
no
statute
authorizing
suit
against
nih
in
its
own
name,
and
yet
petitioners
do
that.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
there
is
in
the...
with
respect
to
agencies
entitled
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
state
court
and
in
own
name.
i
mean,
i
think
with
respect
to
agencies
like
nih
in
a
sense
there's
no
problem
unless
you
get
plaintiffs
like
petitioners
who
name
agencies
even
thought
they're
clearly
not
authorized
to
do
so.
but
there's
another
category
of
agencies
with...
who
are
subject
to
these
sue
and
be
sued
clause.
and
as
we
discussed
in
their
brief...
our
brief,
there
are
also
these
environmental
waivers
that
present
problems
if
the
agency
is
held
not
entitled
to
remove.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
sorry?
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
our
position
is
clearly
it
would
not
be
entitled
to
do
so,
although
we...
it's
quite
plausible
that
had
nih
been
served
as--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i
think
that
would
stand
for
that
proposition.
