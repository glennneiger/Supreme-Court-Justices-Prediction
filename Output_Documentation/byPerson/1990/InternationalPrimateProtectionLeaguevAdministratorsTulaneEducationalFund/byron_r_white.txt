justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
both
the
standing
question
on
the
removal
question?
justice
white
and
decided
the
standing
question
first?
justice
white
yes,
but...
but
do
you
agree
that...
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
about
standing,
it
nevertheless
could
reach
the
removal
question?
justice
white
well,
do
you
agree
that
the...
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
there
was
no
standing
with
these
plaintiffs?
justice
white
all
right,
if
you
agree
with
that,
do
you
then
agree
that
the...
that
it
was
proper
to
reach
this...
the
removal
question?
justice
white
because
i
take
it
an
officer
who's
entitled
to
remove...
let's
assume
that
there
is
an
officer
here
that
was
entitled
to
remove...
that
officer
is
entitled
to
litigate
in
the
federal
court.
justice
white
but
only
against
a
plaintiff
who
has
standing.
justice
white
so
that
the...
if
the
district
court
finds
that
there
is
no
standing,
the
district
court
should
dismiss
and
not
remand.
justice
white
and
to
let
the
suit
go
on
in
the
state
court,
even
though
the
plaintiffs
might
have
standing
there.
justice
white
the
standing...
the
question
here...
it's
a
jurisdictional
question
i
guess.
justice
white
what
kind
of
a
jurisdictional
question
is
it?
justice
white
well,
what
about
1447(c)?
justice
white
it
says
that
there's
a
finding...
if
at
any
time
it
appears
that
district
court
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
case
should
be
remanded.
justice
white
well,
of
course
the
first
circuit
must
have
thought
it
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
go
through
all
those
contortions.
