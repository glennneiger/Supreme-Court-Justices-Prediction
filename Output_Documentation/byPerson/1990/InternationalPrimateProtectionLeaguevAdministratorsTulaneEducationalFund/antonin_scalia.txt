justice
scalia
well,
ms.
woodward,
why...
why
isn't
it
reasonable,
assuming
that
the
removal
issue
was
decided
correctly,
why
is
it
unreasonable
for
the
federal
government
to
say,
we
only
want
our
agents
and
agencies
to
be
sued
by
somebody
who
has
standing
to
sue
them
as
we
view
standing?
justice
scalia
the
state
can
allow
other
people
to
be
sued
on
the
basis
of
whatever
standing
rules
they
want
to
develop.
that
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
this
case
would
be
res
judicata
against
you
as
far
as
nih
and
the
federal
government
is
concerned
but
not
necessarily
against
other
defendants
who
do
not
come
within
the
removal
statute.
justice
scalia
you
would
have
no
problem
with
that?
justice
scalia
well,
are
you
sure
that
that
assumption
is
not
correct?
justice
scalia
you
think
that
when
a
federal
court
upon
removal
dismisses
the
case
for
lack
of
standing
of
one
of
the...
of
one
of
the
parties,
the
suit
cannot
be
rebrought
in
state
court
against
the
other
parties,
absent
the
one
who
didn't
have
standing?
justice
scalia
but
that's
a
totally
different
argument.
i
was
responding
to
your
claim
that
you...
you
have
been
done
in
by
the
removal
because
the
federal
government
would
have
no
interest
in
the
standing
of
these
other
people.
it
doesn't.
the
only
consequence
i
believe
of
this
dismissal
is
that
the
federal
officers
and
the
federal
agencies
cannot
resued
in
state
court.
you
could...
you
could
resue
anybody
else.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
assume
it
means
"her",
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
mean
if
"her",
then
maybe
"it".
justice
scalia
how
far
back
does
this
statute
goes,
ms.
woodward?
do...
do
you
know?
i...
it--
justice
scalia
--it...
you
know
in
the
bad
old
days,
you...
you
couldn't...
there
was
no
question
of
suing
the
agency
or
suing
the
united
states
in
its
own
name.
the
only
way
you
got
at
them
was
by
suing
a
person
for
mandamus.
the
theory
was
that
the
person
was...
if
acting
beyond
his
authority...
was
not
acting
as
the
sovereign.
justice
scalia
so,
you
know,
once
upon
a
time
when
this
was
drafted,
might
it
not
be
that...
that
the
anticipated
effect
of
it
was
exactly
what
the
other
side
is
arguing
for
today?
justice
scalia
what
kind
of
agencies...
i
mean,
other
things
other
than
the
tennessee
valley
authority
and
the
quasi-private
agencies?
i'm
talking
about
agencies...
real
agencies...
like
the
internal
revenue
service,
you
know.
the
days
when
i
was
in
law
school,
all
the
helvering
cases...
i
heard
somebody
refer
once
to
the
helvering
case.
as
you
know,
there
were
hundreds
of
helvering
cases.
justice
scalia
and
sued...
and
sued
as
such.
sued
as
such.
justice
scalia
who
is
this
revisor?
you
say
congress
explained.
who...
who
wrote
these
revisors'
notes?
justice
scalia
is
that
a
reproduction
within
the
house
report
of
the
notes
by
whom?
justice
scalia
who
is
the
revisor
then?
justice
scalia
does
it
say
we
agree
with
all
of
these
notes?
justice
scalia
is
that
clear?
you
know,
officer...
officer
of
the
united
states
has
a
quite
technical
meaning
in
the
constitution
and
for
many
purposes
within
federal
law.
it
seems
to
me
you
might
well
be
an
officer
of
let's
say
the
tba
or
some
federal
corporation
that
is
called
an
agency
of
the
united
states
without
being,
in
common
usage,
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
justice
scalia
mr.
seamon,
before
we
get
off
of
sovereign
immunity,
what
justice
kennedy
was
asking
about,
did
the
government
raise
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defense
in
the
state
court?
justice
scalia
but
you
don't
think
it
was
waived?
justice
scalia
because
if
it
was
waived,
i
assume
there's
no
federal
question
here.
well,
you
don't
plead...
you
don't
plead
sovereign...
you
don't
plead
when
you're
removing.
you
remove
rather
than
plead.
justice
scalia
you
move
against
the
treasury...
the
federal
treasury?
and
the
federal
treasury
says,
no,
i
won't
pay.
what
do
you...
do
you
get
a
mandamus
from
the
state
court?
what
i'm
driving
at
is
maybe
there's
no
need
to
have
the
removal
in
the
case
of
an
agency
as
such,
although
there
is
in
the
case
of
an
officer.
