justice
o'connor
now,
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
it's
been
determined
that
the
petitioners
lacked
standing.
justice
o'connor
how
is
it
in
that
posture
that
we
are
able
to
consider
the
removal
question?
justice
o'connor
yes,
i'm
very
interested
in
how
you
overcome
that.
justice
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
standing...
there
would
be
standing
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
state
court--
justice
o'connor
--but
the
federal
courts
have
determined
that
you
have
no
standing
under
article
iii.
justice
o'connor
well,
now
you
do
concede,
i
suppose,
that
the
word
"person"
has
a
broader
meaning
than
just
an
individual?
justice
o'connor
of
course
you're
really
making
two
arguments
with
respect
to
tulane.
one
is
that
it's
not
a
person
in
the
individual
sense.
and
a
quite
separate
one
that
"acting
under"
means
that
you
be
an
actual
employee.
justice
o'connor
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
o'connor
but
at
the
time
this
was
first...
this
language
was
first
employed,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
that
narrow
meaning
of
the
word,
"officer
of
the
united
states",
was
intended
in
this
language?
justice
o'connor
and
that
would
certainly
explain
the
language
of
the
statute
or
agency
thereof.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
language
was...
has
been
on
the
books
a
long
time...
that
language.
and
perhaps
it's
the
more
natural
reading
of
the
language.
justice
o'connor
well,
presumably
they
still
had
a
cause
of
action
against
tulane,
and
they
also
say
that
the
rules
for
standing
in
state
court
are
not
as
strict
as
article
iii
standing.
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
your
reading
of
this
officer
or
agency
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
"person"
clause.
now,
would
you
explain
to
me
how
you
define
"person"
under
this
statute?
who
does
that
include?
justice
o'connor
and
in
this
case...
tulane
as
well?
justice
o'connor
so
you
interpret
the
word
"person"
here
to
include
the
sovereign?
