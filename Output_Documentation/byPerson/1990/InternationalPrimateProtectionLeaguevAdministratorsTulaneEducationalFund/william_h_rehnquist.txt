chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
first
this
morning
in
argument
no.
90-89,
the
international
primate
protection
league
and
its
members,
et
al.,
v.
the
administrators
of
tulane
educational
fund.
ms.
woodward.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
do
you
mean
on
a
questionable
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
may
be
a
difficult
task.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
oppose
the
motion
to
dismiss?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
would
think
that
if
you
hadn't
wanted
to
name
them
in
the
first
place,
you
wouldn't
have
wanted
them
in
the
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
you...
you
named
nih
as
a
party.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
later
decided
you
didn't
want
them
as
a
party?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
did
you
notify
the
district
court
of
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can't
you
dismiss
on
your
own
motion
under
the
rules
if
you
could...
haven't
served
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
what
you
mean
term
questionable
appeal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
stay
of
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
wonder
if
perhaps,
ms.
woodward,
if
perhaps
very
likely
in
response
to
my
question,
we
aren't
getting
somewhat
away
from
the
question
that's
presented
here...
whether
the
removal
statute
authorizes
nih
to
remove?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that
language
has
no
real
currency
today?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
if
congress
were
to
follow
your
view,
it
should
repeal
the
removal
statute
i
suppose?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
surely
the
hostility
of
state
courts
doesn't
depend
on
whether
it's
an
officer
or
the
federal
officer
before
them...
or
a
federal
agency
before
them.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
woodward.
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that...
that's
a
matter
of
state
law,
isn't
it?
who
is
an
indispensable
party
as
a
defendant
in
a
louisiana
state
lawsuit.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that...
what
is
the
connection
between
tulane
and
the
united
states
that
would
justify
tulane
in
removing
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
acting
director
of
nih
and
to...
a
letter
from
the
acting
director
of
nih
to
tulane?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
say
that
makes
tulane
a
person
acting
under
him
for
purposes
of
the
removal
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
him
in
that
case
would
be
what?
nih
or
the
director
of
nih...
which
one?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
doesn't
ordinarily
include
the
concept
of
standing,
does
it,
mr.
seamon?
don't
we
ordinarily
think
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
as
those
provisions
of
title
28
which
set
out
the
different
bases
for
a
federal
jurisdiction:
1331,
1332,
et
cetera?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
assert
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
would
be
based
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
not
a
lack
of...
so
you
say
motions
are
commonly
made
under
12(b)(6)
which
goes
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
those
motions
are
based
on
lack
of
standing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
sovereign
immunity
goes
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
i
thought
sovereign
immunity
had
to
be
pleaded
if
your
defending
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
may...
it
may
go
to
jurisdiction
in
some
senses,
but
the
word
"subject
matter
jurisdiction"
is
a
fairly
technical
concept.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
ms.
woodward,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
your
brief
cite
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
please
file
copies
of
that
with
the
clerk
[inaudible]
the
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
perhaps
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
you
filed
your
lawsuit
naming
them
as
a
defendant.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
woodward.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
