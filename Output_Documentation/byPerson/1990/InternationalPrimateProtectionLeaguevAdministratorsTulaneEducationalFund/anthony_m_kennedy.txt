justice
kennedy
are
you
arguing
that
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
and
this
court
is
really
required...
are
really
required
to
reach
the
removal
issue
at
some
point,
because
if
you
base
the
case
simply
on
lack
of
standing,
it
goes
back
to
the
state
court,
at
which
point
nih
removes
back
to
federal
court
which
goes
back
to
state
court
based
on
standing.
so
we
have
to
reach
removal
at
some
point.
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
kennedy
well,
isn't
plausible
and
a
permissible
inference
for
this
court
to
make
that
congress
was
very
careful
in
drafting
the
statute
to
exclude
agency
removal
as
you
now
argue,
because
they
were
concerned
that
there
might
have
been
a
construction
of
the
statute
that
would
be
an
implied
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
say
it's
speculation,
but
sovereign
immunity
is
a
well-documented,
fundamental
doctrine
of
our
jurisprudence.
and
if
we
see
that
drafting
the
statute
the
way
that
you
suggest
might
have
raised
serious
questions
about
sovereign
immunity,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
perfectly
legitimate
and
logical
way
to
interpret
the
statute,
quite
consistent
with
our
jurisprudence
that
we
begin
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
kennedy
when...
after
removal
if
there's
no
jurisdiction,
isn't...
doesn't
the
statute
require
that
there
be
a
remand
rather
than
a
dismissal?
justice
kennedy
is
that
the
same
as
subject
matter
jurisdiction...
lacking
standing?
because
the
statute
says
if
it
appears
at
any
time
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
lacking,
the
case
shall
be
remanded
not
dismissed.
justice
kennedy
well,
why
aren't
they
entitled
to...
to
sue
nih
if
there's
just...
if
the
only
ground
is
no
standing?
let's
assume
that
all
that
was...
the
only
thing
the
district
court
ruled
on
was
standing.
justice
kennedy
12(b)(6)
of
course
is
also
a
very
understated
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted.
justice
kennedy
may
a
state
court
issue
an
injunction
against
a
federal
agency?
justice
kennedy
may
a
state
court
issue
an
injunction
against
a
federal
agency?
justice
kennedy
is
there...
meaning...
what
is
that
tarbell's
case?
