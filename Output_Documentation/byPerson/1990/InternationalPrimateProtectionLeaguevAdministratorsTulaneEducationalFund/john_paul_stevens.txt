justice
stevens
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
notion
that
the
category
of
officers
of
the
united
states
and
the
category
of
officers
of
agencies
are
identical
with
one
another
is
plain
from
the
face
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
how
do
you...
how...
what
is
it
that
we
look
to
to
determine
that
that's
what
congress...
that
congress
thought
those
two
categories
were
co-extensive?
justice
stevens
oh,
all
right.
you're
right.
i
see.
but
that
everyone
in
that
subset
would
be
an
officer
of
the
united
states?
justice
stevens
is
that...
is
that
point
plain
from
the
meaning...
from
the
text
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
by
that
do
you
include
all
lawyers
who
are
members
of
the
bar
of
the
court?
justice
stevens
do
you
include
all
lawyers
who
are
members
of
the
bar
of
the
court
when
you
talk
about
officers
of
the
court?
justice
stevens
are
they
officers
of
the
united
states?
justice
stevens
well,
can
we
tell
from
the
face
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
seamon,
just
to
get
it
straight
in
my
mind?
the
fifth
circuit,
which
holds
that
agencies
can
remove,
doesn't
rely
on
this
theory,
does
it?
doesn't
it
rely
on
the
theory
that
you
just
take
the
comma
out
in
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute?
that
an
agency
can
remove
because
it's
an
agency
not
because
it's
a
person
acting
on
behalf
of
an
officer?
justice
stevens
so
we
don't
whether
the
fifth
circuit
would
accept
your
rationale
on
the
tulane
argument.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
1447(c)
which
seems
to
require
remand
rather
than
dismissal?
you
say
there's
a
futility
exception...
that
the
litigation
in
the
state
court
would
be
futile.
does
the...
is
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
futile
a
question
of
state
law
or
federal
law?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
if
it's
a
question
of
state
law
that
would
be
a
reason
to
remand
and
let
the
state
court
decide
it.
and
some
of
the
things
you
said
suggest
to
me
that
might
be
the
case.
justice
stevens
i
can
see
why
if
you
said
for
some
reason
there
are
no...
there
are
no
defendants
except
federal
defendants
who
have
properly
pleaded
sovereign
immunity
or
something
like
that,
that
it's
perfectly
clear
as
a
matter
of
federal
that
the
state
action
couldn't
go
forward
and
then
your
futility
exceptancies
make
a
lot
of
sense.
i'm
not
sure
on
the
facts
of
this
case...
i
don't
know
the
case
you
cited,
of
course...
that
your
argument
is
really
as
strong.
justice
stevens
mr.
seamon,
suppose
you
get
a
judgment
from
a
state
court
against
an
agency
as
such,
not
an
individual...
not
an
officer...
but
an
agency
as
such.
how
do
you
execute
upon
that
judgment
without
the
assistance
of
a
federal
court?
