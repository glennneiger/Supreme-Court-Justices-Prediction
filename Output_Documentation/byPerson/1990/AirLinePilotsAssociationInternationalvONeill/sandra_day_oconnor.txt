justice
o'connor
mr.
gold,
i
had
really
thought
that
our
cases
had
spoken
in
terms
of
a
reasonableness
component
to
the
arbitrary
standard
here
and
that
you
would
have
us
read
that
out
of
the
standard
and
limit
it
to
negotiations
or
actions
taken
in
bad
faith
or
with
hostility.
now,
do
you
really
find
support
in
our
case
law
for
that
kind
of
a
limitation,
or
don't
we
find
that
the
arbitrary
component
of
vaca
against
sipes'
standard
imports
some
degree
of
reasonableness
inquiry?
justice
o'connor
mr.
harper,
is
there
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
here
as
to
whether
the
union
acted
in
bad
faith?
justice
o'connor
did
the
fifth
circuit
review
the
evidence
with
an
eye
toward
the
bad-faith
allegation?
