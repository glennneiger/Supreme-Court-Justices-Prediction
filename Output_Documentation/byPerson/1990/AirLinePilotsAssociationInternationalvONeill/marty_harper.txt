mr.
marty
harper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
on
a
court
of
appeals
reversal
of
summary
judgment,
and
in
analyzing
this
case,
we
cannot
overlook
that
fact.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
reversing
the
district
court,
correctly
applied
the
summary
judgment
standards
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
of
this
court.
in
addition,
in
analyzing
the
union's
conduct,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
applied
the
three-prong
standard
set
forth
in
vaca
v.
sipes,
which
has
been
around
and
the
unions
have
been
dealing
with
for
24
years.
what
the
union
wants
to
do
today
is
to
convince
the
court
to
change
the
law
so
that
it
can
avoid
liability
to
1,400
striking
pilots
who
remained
out
on
strike
for
2
years.
in
essence,
what
the
union
wants
is
a
standard
of
conduct
that
is
based
upon
subjective
hostility.
in
other
words,
they
want
to
be
immune
from
having
their
substantive
decisions
reviewed
at
all.
it
should
not
come
as
any
surprise
to
the
court--
mr.
marty
harper
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
that
complicated
at
all.
mr.
marty
harper
what
arbitrary
means
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
simply
the
question
as
to
whether
a
reasoned
decision
was
needed
and
whether
a
reasoned
decision
was
made.
and
in
deciding
that,
what
needs--
mr.
marty
harper
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
and
second-guessing
is
not
what
the
court--
mr.
marty
harper
--they
should
look
at
the
decision,
your
honor,
and
try
to
find
out
and
look
at
what
the
relevant
factors
were
that
the
union
officials
considered
in
making
a
decision
and
then
determine
if
the
decision
was
based
upon
an
in
fact
consideration
of
those
factors.
and
if
in
fact
the
judgment
or
conduct
is
not
based
upon
a
reasoned
consideration
of
relevant
union
factors,
then
the
conduct
is
arbitrary.
but
this--
mr.
marty
harper
--it's
a
higher
standard,
your
honor,
than
negligence.
mr.
marty
harper
you
have
to
look
at
the
factors,
your
honor,
that
went
into
the
conduct
that
the
union
followed
and
look
at
the
actual
circumstances
that
were
taken
into
consideration
which
were
going
to
be
numerous,
and
then
balance
to
see
if
the
decision
was
made
based
upon
a
rational
consideration
of
those
factors.
mr.
marty
harper
that's
a
higher
standard
than
simply
breaching
the...
breaching
a
duty
or
a
negligence.
mr.
marty
harper
those
are
difficult
items
to
distinguish,
your
honor,
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
continuum
of
arbitrariness,
and
there
comes
a
point
in
time
like
in
the
rawson
case
where
this
court
has
decided
that
an
allegation
based
upon
pure
negligence
is
not
sufficient
to
staying
a
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation.
but
an
allegation
based
upon
conduct
that
is
more
serious
than
that,
not
taking
into
consideration
relevant
factors,
and
then
moving
off
and
making
the
decision
that's
not
based
upon
those
factors,
it's
arbitrary,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
require
the
plaintiffs
in
this
type
of
situation
to
identify
as
best
they
can
through
discovery
and
the
trial
the
factors
that
were
actually
in
fact
considered
by
the
union
negotiators
or
the
union
officials
when
they
made
a
decision
and
then
would
have
to
go
step
further
to
demonstrate
whether
or
not
the
decision
was
based
upon
a
consideration
of
those
factors.
in
this
case,
what
has
happened,
your
honor,
is
many
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
advanced
here
to
justify
what
the
union
did
are
post
hoc
arguments
of
counsel.
mr.
marty
harper
your
honor,
the
court
does
not
substitute
as
judgment
for
that
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
case
here,
the
o'neill
case,
and
look
at
the
basis
upon
which
the
fifth
circuit
rendered
its
opinion,
which
is
the
tedford
opinion,
you
will
find
exactly
that
sort
of
analysis
in
the
tedford
opinion.
in
the
tedford
opinion,
there
are
a
couple
of
judgments
that
the
union
officials
could
have
made.
the
court
of
appeals
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
we
are
not
going
to
select
whether
or
not
it
was
correct
for
the
union
to
do
one
or
the
other.
all
we're
going
to
do
is
to
analyze
that
the
decision
that
was
made...
to
ensure
it
was
based
upon
relevant
factors
and
that
the
judgment
was
based
upon
relevant
factors.
if
it
is,
it
would
be
arbitrary.
mr.
marty
harper
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
the
trier
of
fact
may
find
that
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
union
didn't
act
rationally
or
reasonably
in
going
about
the
decision
that
it
made.
take
into
consideration
factors
as
evidence
that
the
union
officials
might
not
have
considered
which
would
support
the
conclusion
by
the
trier
of
fact
that
the
conduct
was
arbitrary.
mr.
marty
harper
under
some
circumstances,
your
honor,
in
this
area
it...
the
line
starts
to
fuzz.
well,
we
do
not
believe--
mr.
marty
harper
--we're
not--
mr.
marty
harper
--your
honor,
all
we
are
are...
our
position
is
that
all
we
need
to
have
is
an
obligation
upon
these
union
officials
to
consider
relevant
facts
and
make
a
decision
based
upon
those.
mr.
marty
harper
that's
a
relevant
consideration
when
you
evaluate
at
the
trial
level
the
conduct
of
the
union.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
record
does...
shows
or
demonstrates
that
during
the
critical
negotiation
the
individuals
who
made
the
decision
did
not
consider
an
unconditional
offer
to
return
to
work
as
a
viable
alternative
before
they
decided
to
settle
with
continental
under
the
terms
and
conditions
that
they
did.
that
is
evidence
of
arbitrary
conduct,
we
[inaudible].
mr.
marty
harper
i
think
it's
very
close
to
that,
your
honor.
in
those
types
of
considerations,
you
look
at,
if,
for
example,
an
agent...
head
of
an
agency
has
changed
a
policy
and
in
order
to
have
that
act
substantiated,
there
has
to
be
some
explanation,
for
example,
as
to
why
that
policy
was
changed.
that's
fundamentally
the
same
sort
of
analysis
that
we
think
is
appropriate
here.
mr.
marty
harper
absolutely,
your
honor--
mr.
marty
harper
--if
in
fact
the
decision
has
considered
relevant
factors.
it
may
be
wrong.
it
may
be
atrocious,
as
the
district
court
said
here.
it
may
be
beyond
what
is
reasonable
as
the
chief
negotiator
said
here.
it
may
have...
if
it's
wrong
and
the
process
is
intact,
then
the
conduct
would
still
be
considered
to
be
nonarbitrary,
and
as
a
result
there's
no
liability
associated
with
it.
mr.
marty
harper
i
think
it
absolutely
was,
your
honor.
what
they
did
was
on
summary
judgment
look
at
the
record,
which
the
trial
court
never
did,
and
determine,
based
upon
the
review,
that
there
were
substantial
facts
in
dispute--
mr.
marty
harper
--and--
mr.
marty
harper
--and
discriminatory.
and
all
they
did
is
leave
it
for
the
trial
court
to
decide,
based
upon
an
appropriate
standard,
whether
the
conduct
by
the
union
breached
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
that's
all
the
fifth
circuit
did.
mr.
marty
harper
that's
correct
and
we
haven't
gotten
there
yet,
your
honor.
this
is
on
summary
judgment,
and
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
exactly
the
right
thing
in
leaving
the
ultimate
issues
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
breach
of
the
duty
fair
representation
until
trial.
mr.
marty
harper
your
evidence,
there's
evidence
in
the
record
and
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
evidence
in
the
record
at
this
particular
time
that
in
fact
the
union
did
act
in
bad
faith.
and
also
that
they
acted
in
a
discriminatory
manner
and
in
an
arbitrary
manner,
and
all
of
those
items
are
included
or--
mr.
marty
harper
--it
does
not
appear
from
the
record,
your
honor,
that
the
court
did
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
purported
to
look
at
all
of
the
items
of
conduct
that
this
union
engaged
in
and
to
make
a
conclusive
decision
on
all
elements
at
the
summary
judgment
level.
mr.
marty
harper
if
that
was
the
only
judgment,
your
honor,
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
then
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
marty
harper
absolutely
not.
mr.
marty
harper
your
honor,
based
upon
the
record
as
we
developed
it
through
deposition
testimony
and
through
the
gleaning
of
notes
and
records
that
the
negotiators
that
we
were
entitled
to
depose,
they
did
not
consider
at
that
critical
point
in
time
the
unconditional
offer
to
return
to
work.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court--
mr.
marty
harper
--there's
evidence
of
the
admission
that
they
did
not
consider
it
at
this
point...
at
the
point
in
time.
mr.
marty
harper
yes,
we
do,
your
honor,
through
the
attachments,
and
it's
probably
set
forth
in
a
little
bit
more
detail
in
connection
with
a
motion
for
reconsideration.
mr.
marty
harper
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
for
the
justice
that,
you
know,
our
discovery
got
stopped
along
the
way.
so
the
discovery
at
this
particular
point
in
time
is
far
from
being
completed.
we
focused
only
on
the
pilot
negotiators
who
made
the
decision
or
were
involved
in
the
decision
at
the
end
to
settle
the
strike.
i
thought
the
burden
of
the
argument
in
your
brief
was
that
the
settlement
was
much
worse
than
a
return
to
surrender,
but
you
don't
really
rely
on
that?
mr.
marty
harper
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
but
in
fact
it
is.
and
again
it
would
be
evidence
at
trial.
mr.
marty
harper
not
at
this...
not
at
this
level,
your
honor.
not
at
all.
mr.
marty
harper
we
are
not
claiming
and
our
position
is
that
we
have
to
focus
on
the
result.
what
our...
what
our
argument
is
and
it
must
be
a
rational
consideration
of
those
factors
and
the
judgment
based
upon
that--
mr.
marty
harper
--and
the
result
is
only
evidence,
your
honor,
of
the
conduct
that
the
union
negotiators
engaged
in.
mr.
marty
harper
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
and
if
it's
one
possible
result
based
upon
a...
the
analysis
that
we
have
urged
the
court,
and
if
the...
that
determination
then
is
that
it's
nonarbitrary
because
of
the
process
that
went
through,
then
the
results
would
be
okay.
mr.
marty
harper
the
two
choice,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
that...
you
can,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
think
that
there's
more
to
it
in
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
because
there
are...
in
contexts
like
this,
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
the
union
negotiators
are
going
to
take
into
consideration
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
they
arrive
at.
as
long
as
those
factors
are
relevant
factors
and
the
basis
is...
the
decision
is
based
on
that.
mr.
marty
harper
the
union,
your
honor,
has
a
duty
to
represent
under
the
railway
labor
act
the
members
of
this
craft
or
class,
and
their
conduct
has
to
be
a...
on
behalf
and
the
benefit
for
the
craft
or
class.
so
for
the
most
part--
mr.
marty
harper
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
craft
or
class
were
the
continental
pilots
at
continental
air
lines.
mr.
marty
harper
and
what
the
problem
is,
your
honor--
mr.
marty
harper
--if
you
go
beyond
the
class
or
craft,
you're--
mr.
marty
harper
--it
may
not
be,
your
honor,
because
the
problem
with
that
is
that
that
craft
or
class
becomes
a
minority
group
within
a
larger
class,
and
they
run
the
risk,
if
they
don't
have
this
broad
duty
of
fair
representation,
of
being
treated
very
badly
in
a
discriminatory
and
arbitrary
way
by
the
union.
mr.
marty
harper
and
what
benefits
them
and
what
the
union
needs
to
do
on
their
behalf
in
the
context
of
that
particular
representation.
mr.
marty
harper
those
are
considerations
that
the
union
might
take
into
consideration,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
representing
the
craft
or
class--
mr.
marty
harper
--but
they
can't
override.
mr.
marty
harper
i
don't
intend
to
be
nebulous
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
the...
in
this
case
the
union
should
have
taken
into
consideration
only
those
factors
that
benefit
this
craft
or
class.
mr.
marty
harper
not
to
the
detriment
of
the
craft
or
class
that
they're
representing,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
and
then
that
conduct,
your
honor,
could
be
made.
it
could
be
bad
faith,
it
could
be
discriminatory,
and
it
could
be
arbitrary
in
the
way
that
they
go
about
making
that
decision.
because
they're
putting
motives
and
events
that
are
beyond
what
is
on...
in
the
best
interest
of
the
craft
or
class
in
these
negotiations,
and
that
is
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
marty
harper
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
let
me...
it
would...
i'm
sorry...
if
they
put
the
national
interest
above?
mr.
marty
harper
it
would
be
arbitrary
conduct.
mr.
marty
harper
uh--
mr.
marty
harper
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
in
some
regard
they
have
to--
mr.
marty
harper
--no.
it's
part
of
the
three-step
procedure
and
analysis
that
the
tedford
court
requires,
and
in
this
case
the
results
are
evident,
your
honor,
that
the
conduct
was
arbitrary
because
it
was
worse
than
an
unconditional
offer
to
return
to
work.
mr.
marty
harper
in
this
case,
the
result...
i
don't
know
if
it's
unfair,
your
honor,
but
it
has
been
characterized
by
the
chief
pilot
negotiator
as
beyond
what
was
reasonable,
has
been
characterized
by
him
as
bastardizing
forever
the
seniority
system,
and
has
been
characterized
by
the
district
court
as
being
atrocious.
now
if
that's
the
same
as
being
unfair,
then
those
are
the
ways
it
has
been
characterized.
mr.
marty
harper
yes,
your
honor,
as
a
result
of
the
terry
opinion.
mr.
marty
harper
absolutely.
there
has
to
be
a
way--
mr.
marty
harper
--and
that's
all
that...
what
happens,
your
honor,
in
cases
like
suits
against
fiduciaries,
trustees,
officers
and
directors
of
a
corporation,
or
governmental
agents,
you
have
to
be
able
to
describe
for
the
jury
or
the
trier
of
fact
where
the
conduct
crosses
the
line.
and
that's
why
i
submit--
mr.
marty
harper
--justice
kennedy,
the
jury
is
capable
though
of
making
key
decisions
in
antitrust,
securities,
breach
of
contract
suits,
and
justice
stevens
has
mentioned
just
last
term
that
the
reality
of
the
employment
relations
are
typical
grist
for
a
jury
judgment.
so,
in
fact,
it
is
our
position
that,
given
the
correct
instructions
of
law
by
the
court,
that
it
is
perfectly...
a
jury
is
perfectly
capable
of
judging
the
conduct
engaged
in
by
a
union.
i'm
getting
close
to
the
end.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
here
that
we
have
not
talked
about--
mr.
marty
harper
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
that's
correct.
mr.
marty
harper
they're
going
to
bargain
on
behalf
of
the
craft,
your
honor,
and
that
the
craft's
interest
has
to
come
ahead
of
the
national
interest
of
the--
mr.
marty
harper
--absolutely.
mr.
marty
harper
no,
your
honor,
they
cannot
do
that.
mr.
marty
harper
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your...
they
can't
settle
it
to
the
disadvantage
of
this
particular
craft,
your
honor.
mr.
marty
harper
we
do
not
have
that
here,
your
honor.
this
is
the
master
executive
counsel
for
only
the
craft
of
pilots
at
continental
air
lines.
and,
justice
scalia,
one...
i
think
what
demonstrates
where
there
is
a
real
problem
here
with
these
pilots
being
represented
by
their
union
is
in
the
superseniority
aspects
of
it.
because
there
the
union
did
go
beyond
what
was
in
the
best
interest
of
their
pilots
and
they
gave
away
to
the
non-striking
pilots
future
vacancies
to
the
detriment,
the
serious
detriment,
of
the
pilots
who
have
been
out
on
strike
for
2
years.
and
that's
why
we
have
to
look
at
this
thing
as
conduct
that
breaches
the
arbitrary
standard,
the
discriminatory
standard,
and
the
bad-faith
standard.
and
that
has
been
the
standard
that
this
court
has
articulated
for
24
years,
and
we
think
it
ought
to
be
the
standard
that
applies
here.
we
ask
this
court,
with
the
solicitor,
to
hold
that
the
union
leadership
add
full-scale
responsibilities
to
its
members.
we
ask
you
to
decide,
as
the
fifth
circuit
did,
that
there
was
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
union
defaulted
on
these
responsibilities
so
that
a
trier
of
fact
is
entitled
to
pass
upon
that
question.
we
ask
this
court
to
conclude
that
the...
no
union
leadership
is
above
the
law,
immune
to
the
law,
or
should
be
permitted
to
be
indifferent
to
the
law.
the
air
line
pilots
association
is
not
immune
from
its
responsibilities
which
goes
with
that
control.
mr.
marty
harper
absolutely,
your
honor.
towards
the
end
of
the
opinion,
on
the
second
or
third
page
from
the
end,
the
court
of
appeals
addresses
that
specifically
and
says
that
there's
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
union
acted
in
a
discriminatory
way,
and
it's
left
up
to
the
trial
for...
the
point
in
time
for
the
union
is
to
answer
why
it
did.
mr.
marty
harper
it's
conduct
that
is
not
based
upon
the
best
interest
of
the
unit
and
disadvantages
an
individual
or
a
group
within
the
unit.
it
can't
be
based
upon
irrelevant
considerations
like
race,
when
the
dfr
first
started
back
in
steele.
and
we
think
that
the
decision
here
on
the
super-seniority
issue
to
give
up
the
future
spaces
to
the
non-strikers
is
a
fundamental
right
that
these
strikers
had
upon
the
return
to
work,
and
without
any
justification,
and
if
in
fact
justification
is
even
permitted,
these...
this
union
acted
discriminatorially
towards
these
pilots
by
giving
those
away.
thank
you.
