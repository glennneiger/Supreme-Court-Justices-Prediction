justice

well,
mr.
gold,
that
was
going
to
be
my
question.
suppose
the
union
commits
what
in
other
circumstances,
say,
in
the
legal
profession,
would
be
malpractice.
it
misses
a
grievance
deadline.
but
it's
in
very
good
faith.
it...
now
is
there
liability
there?
justice
kennedy
so
we're
talking
here
about
a
standard
that
applies
across
the
board,
administration
of
the
contract,
grievances,
routine
procedures,
as
well
as
the
more
complex
context
of
conducting
bargaining?
justice
kennedy
well,
i...
on
duty
of
care,
you'll
recall
from
the
rawson
case
where
the
union
allegedly
negligently
contributed
to
the
death
of
mine
workers,
we
said
that
the
union
could
not
be
sued
under
state
law.
and
now
you're
saying
there's
a
broad
immunity
based
on
a
good-faith
standard
under
federal
law.
i
know
of--
justice
kennedy
--i
know
of
no
parallel
in
all
of
the
law,
other
than
for
sovereign
immunity,
which
gives
an
immunity
that
tests...
is
that
extensive.
justice
kennedy
how's
that
any
different
than
negligence?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
say
so.
but
how
do
you
distinguish
between
a
negligently
conducted
negotiation
and
an
arbitrary
one?
justice
kennedy
because--
justice
kennedy
--well,
it
may
not
have
a
community
standard
of
care
component.
i
suppose
that's
the
only
difference.
i
find
it
very,
very
difficult
to
distinguish
the
two.
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
you
have
a
right
to
jury
trial
under
that
terry
case?
justice
kennedy
then
reasoning
backwards,
i
suppose
it
helps
your
position
that
we
have
to
have
a
standard
that
manageable
for
the
jury.
justice
kennedy
it's
backwards
reasoning,
but
i
think
perhaps
we're
compelled
to
engage
in
it.
justice
kennedy
i
don't
know
that
a
jury
could
manageably
consider
an
apa-type...
administrative
procedure
act-type
of
standard
as
to
whether
or
not
they...
the
unit
acted
rationally.
i
don't
know
if
the
jury
is
capable
of
doing
that.
justice
kennedy
is
this
on
the
discrimination
point?
