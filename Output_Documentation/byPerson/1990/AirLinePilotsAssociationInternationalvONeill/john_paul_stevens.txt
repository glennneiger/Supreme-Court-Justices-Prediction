justice
stevens
mr.
harper,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions?
first,
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
record
showed
that
the
union
did
consider
what...
which
would
be
better,
the
settlement
or
a
surrender,
an
outright
return
to
work,
they
considered
it,
but
they
came
to
an
erroneous
conclusion
on
the
issue,
you
would
lose?
justice
stevens
so
it's
not
critical
for
us
to
decide
whether
this
was
a
worse
deal
than
a
return
to--
justice
stevens
--but
it
is
critical
to
decide
whether
they
considered
it.
and
is
it
your
position
on
that
that
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
based
on
admissions
by
the
union
that
they
didn't
or
a
total
absence
of
evidence
of
any
discussion
of
it?
justice
stevens
but
i'm
asking
you
do
you
say
that
because
there's
a
failure
of...
in
absence
of
any
evidence
showing
they
did
discuss
it
or
is
there
evidence
of
an
admission
that
they
did
not
discuss
it?
which
is
it?
justice
stevens
i
see.
do
you
refer
to
that
evidence
in
your
brief?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
but
we
don't
have
to
resolve
that
in
order
to
decide
this
case.
justice
stevens
you
say
it
could
be
arbitrary,
but
is
it
as
a
matter
of
law
arbitrary
when
they
rely
on
the
factors
the
chief
justice
described?
justice
stevens
it's
not
arbitrary?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
as
a
matter
of
law
in
every
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
arose
out
of
a
bitter
labor
dispute
between
continental
airlines
and
the
petitioner,
airline
pilots
association
international,
the
union
that
represented
the
continental's
pilots.
respondents
are
a
group
of
pilots
who
are
dissatisfied
with
petitioner's
settlement
of
the
unsuccessful
strike
against
continental.
contending
that
petitioner's
settlement
of
the
strike
resulted
in
less
favorable
terms
for
striking
pilots
and
the
union
could
have
achieved
by
a
unilateral
decision
simply
to
return
to
work.
respondents
sued
petitioner
for,
among
other
things,
breach
of
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation.
respondents
argued
that
petitioner
had
breached
that
duty
by
arbitrarily
settling
the
strike
in
an
incompetent
manner.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
petitioner;
the
court
ruled
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
petitioner
had
acted
in
bad
faith
or
had
discriminated
against
any
of
its
constituents.
the
court
held
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
does
not
protect
union
members
against
inadequate
representation
so
long
as
the
union
has
acted
in
good
faith
and
not
discriminated.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
has
three
distinct
components.
the
union
breaches
the
duty
if
its
conduct
is
either
discriminatory,
taken
in
bad
faith,
or
arbitrary.
the
court
held
that
a
jury
could
find
that
petitioner's
conduct
was
arbitrary
because
it
could
find
that
the
petitioner
had
settled
the
strikes
on
terms
that
were
less
favorable
than
could
have
achieved
by
simply
terminating
the
strike.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
court
was
correct
in
ruling
that
the
union
breaches
its
duty
if
its
actions
whether
made
in
the
course
of
processing
grievances
or
negotiating
agreements
are
either
arbitrary,
discriminatory,
or
in
bad
faith.
we
conclude,
however,
that
the
court
committed
error
in
its
elaboration
and
application
of
the
arbitrariness
component
of
the
fair
representation
duty.
the
union's
actions
are
arbitrary
only
if
in
light
of
the
factual
and
legal
landscape
at
the
time
of
the
actions,
the
union's
behavior
is
so
far
outside
a
wide
range
of
reasonableness
that
it
can
fairly
be
called
irrational.
the
mere
fact
that,
in
retrospect,
petitioner's
settlement
of
the
strike
proved
less
advantageous,
and
abandonment
of
the
strike
does
not
mean
that
the
union
acted
irrationally
in
securing
the
settlement.
the
legal
consequences
of
the
unilateral
return
to
work
were
not
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
and
the
agreement
avoided
potentially
lengthy
and
conceivably
unsuccessful
litigation.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
