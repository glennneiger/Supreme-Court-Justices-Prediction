chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1493,
the
air
line
pilots
association,
international
v.
joseph
o'neill.
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
rehnquist
call
the
what
award?
the
order
and--
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
word
"arbitrary".
do
you
say
that
the...
that
arbitrary
has
no
place
in
the
test
or
that
they
simply
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
the
word
arbitrary?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gold.
mr.
harper,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
harper,
would
you
standard
require
detailed
examination
of
how
the
union
officials
went
about
reaching
this
agreement?
you
say
it
has
to
have...
they
have
to
must
have
considered
all
the
factors.
that
opens
up,
i
presume,
just,
you
know,
what
went
on
at
the
meetings
of
the
officials
who
were
given
the
responsibility
for
trying
to
settle
the
thing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
a
court
reviewing
the
union's
conduct
feels,
yes,
the
union
considers
all...
considered
all
the
factors
that
it
said
it
was
going
to
consider.
but
in
the
view
of
the
court
there
was
a
factor
that
it
should
have
considered
but
didn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
if
a
court
says
we
see
a
factor
we
think
the
union
should
have
considered.
the
union
didn't
purport
to
consider
it,
it
didn't
consider
it,
that
would
allow
it
to
set
aside
the
decision?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
a
possibility?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
of
course
if
you
say
the
union
didn't
act
reasonably,
that
isn't
far
from
a
negligence
standard,
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
union
cannot
make
a
sort
of
command
decision,
saying
we
realize
we're
not
doing
very
well
by
the
continental
pilots
and
we
could
do
better,
but
the
long-run
interest
of
the
airline
pilots
we
represent
with
all
the
other
airlines
would
be
served
by
this
deal
that
doesn't
do
very
well
for
continental?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
it's--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
think
you
can
give
a
better...
give
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
something
like
that.
it
seems
to
me
you're
quite
nebulous
on
the
point,
unless
you
intend
to
be
nebulous.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
okay,
but
answer
a
hypothetical
question.
the
union
decides
that
the
proposed
deal
we're
about
to
enter
into
with
the...
for
the
continental
pilots
is
not
the
best
we
could
do
for
them,
but
if
we
don't
take
this,
we
are
going
to
greatly
harm
pilots
with
american,
united,
all
the
other
airlines
we...
so
we're
going
to
have
to
sacrifice
a
little
bit
of
the
interest
of
the
continental
pilots
in
order
to
help
all
of
the
pilots
we
represent.
can
it
do
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't...
i
think
you
could
answer
the
question
yes
or
no
and
then
explain
if
you
want
to.
by
hypothesis
it
is
to
the
detriment
of
the
continental
pilots.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harper.
mr.
gold,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
think
you've
answered
the
question
mr
gold.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1493,
airline
pilots
association
international
versus
o'neill
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
