justice
scalia
but
would
you
think
that
that
was
within
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
union
got
the
best
deal
it
could?
justice
scalia
including
no
deal,
in
effect...
just
abandoning
the
strike?
is
that
clear?
i'm
not
sure.
justice
scalia
the
best
way
to
proceed
taking
into
account
what?
is
there
a
wade
into
that,
the
damage
to
the
power
of
the
union
that
would
have
occurred
from
unconditionally
giving
in
after
a
long
strike
and
bitter
strike?
justice
scalia
is
that
part
of
the
factor
that
the
union
was
allowed
to
take
into
account?
justice
scalia
well,
what
do
you
think
for
purposes
of
a
good-faith
test
which
you
are
urging?
do
you
take
into
account
for
good
faith
the
fact
that
the
union
was
looking
to
its
national
power
and
how
that
would
be
eroded
by
losing
a
strike
of
this
sort
that
had
gone
on
for
2
years
and
was
so
bitter?
or
is
good
faith
to
be
determined
solely
on
the
basis
of
what
was
good
for
the
members
of
this
bargaining
unit?
justice
scalia
to
sacrifice
the
members
of
this
bargaining--
justice
scalia
--unit
for
the
benefit
of
members
of
other
bargaining
units.
justice
scalia
well,
no,
i'm...
well,
it's
the
way
i
would
put
it.
are
they
and--
justice
scalia
--i
mean,
it's
like
the
word
sacrifice.
it's
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing.
the
union
has
the
interest
of
many
bargaining
units
nationally.
it
might
well
intelligently
decide
that
we
could
get
a
better
deal
from
the
employer
of
this
bargaining
unit
by
throwing
in
the
towel
on
unconditionally
giving
up
the
strike,
but
that
would
impair
our
position
nationwide
and
other
bargaining
units
would
be
hurt.
now,
can
they
take
into
account
other
bargaining
units
in
the
deal
that
they
make
or
must
their...
all
their
actions
be
for
the
best
interest
of
the
single
bargaining
unit
at
issue?
justice
scalia
mr.
harper,
the
word
arbitrary
is
not
a...
really
a
new
one
for
us.
we've
been
using
it
for
half
a
century
to
review
agency
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
think
mr.
gold
has
probably
asked
us
to
use
it
a
number
of
times
in
that
context...
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
abusive
discretion,
or
otherwise
not
in
according
to
the
law.
do
you
think
that
its
meaning
here
in
reviewing
union
action
is
about
the
same
as
its
meaning
in
reviewing
agency
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
scalia
and
a
court
may
think
it's
wrong
but
still
not
think
that
it's
arbitrary.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
but
that
involves
more
than
just
considering
all
the
factors.
there
are
certain
boundary
beyond
which
your
consideration,
even
if
you've
considered
them
all,
your
conclusion
is
just
arbitrary.
i
mean,
a
man
comes
up
to
you
and
puts
a
gun
to
your
head
and
says,
your
money
and...
your
money
or
your
life,
and
you
consider
it
very
carefully
and
you
say
my
life.
[laughter]
i
mean,
that's...
that's
ridiculous,
isn't
it?
just
because
you've
considered
that--
justice
scalia
--yes.
can't
you
reach
a
conclusion
that
is
nonetheless
arbitrary
even
if
you've
considered
both?
justice
scalia
can
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
gold?
is
one
of
the
relevant
union
factors...
are
all
the
relevant
union
factors
only
factors
that
relate
to
this
bargaining
unit,
or
can
the
union
in
effect
say,
well,
this
result
may
be
better
for
this
bargaining
unit
but
we
have
other
fish
to
fry?
justice
scalia
but
that's
not
just
the
bargaining
unit.
that
craft
or
class
in
other
bargaining
units
as
well,
no?
justice
scalia
not
pilots
at
large
in
other
airlines
as
well?
justice
scalia
well,
i--
justice
scalia
--let's
make
it
clear
what
i'm
asking
you.
suppose
the
union
says
it
will
be
better
for
this
bargaining
unit,
but
we
will
just
get
clobbered
in
later
negotiations
with
other
airlines.
our
other
pilots
will
be
harmed
if
we
simply,
after
a
2
years'
worth
of
a
bitter
strike,
throw
in
the
towel.
net...
given
all
the
pilots
that
we
have
to
represent,
it's
better
for
all
of
them
that
this
bargaining
unit
may
not
do
as
well,
but
we
come
to
a
negotiated
end
to
the
strike
rather
than
simply
abandoning
it.
is
that...
is
that
a
reasonable
decision?
justice
scalia
so
you
say
the
reasonable
factors
that
can
be
taken
into
account
are
only
factors
relating
to
the
particular
bargaining
unit
to
which
the
negotiations
pertain?
justice
scalia
mr.
harper,
before
you
do
that,
let
me
get...
this
relates
to
what
the
chief
justice
was
asking
you
about.
all
of
your
clients
are
union
members
in
this
case,
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
now,
i
can
understand
why
a
nonunion
member
might
have
a
cause
for
feeling
aggrieved
if
the
union
didn't
take
it
into
account,
exclusively
the
interest
of
his
bargaining
unit.
but
all
your
union
members
join
this
union
knowing
it
was
an
industrywide
union
that,
you
know,
one
for
all
and
all
for
one.
they
get
some
benefits
from
joining
an
industrywide
union.
they
could
have
had
a
union
just
for
that
shop,
couldn't
they?
justice
scalia
just
a
special
union
for
continental.
but
they
chose
to
join
alpa
in
order
to
have
the
benefit
of
an
industrywide
union.
now
doesn't
there
go
along
with
that
the
understanding
that
the
union's
going
to
bargain
in
the
interest
of
the
whole
industry,
not...
not
in
the
interest
of
just
this
bargaining
unit?
justice
scalia
but
they
have
obligations...
they
have
obligations
to
these
other
units
as
well,
don't
they?
justice
scalia
can
they
settle
this
one
to
the
detriment
of
the
other
ones?
justice
scalia
they
can't
do
that
and
yet
they
can't
take
it
into
account
either.
justice
scalia
what
case
last
year,
mr.
gold?
justice
scalia
but
what
did
the
district
court
assume
on
that
point?
mustn't
the
district
court
have
assumed
that
the
union
was
uncertain
as
to
what
involved?
justice
scalia
well,
is
it
entitled
to
do
that
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
scalia
but
that
was
controverted,
wasn't
it?
and
wasn't...
among
the
things
controverted,
wasn't
the
certainty
of
the
law
one
of
the
controverted
matters?
justice
scalia
whether
there's
uncertainty
is
not
the
issue.
on
your
theory,
the
issue
is
whether
the
union
itself
was
uncertain.
that...
that's
a
good
faith--
