mr.
laurence
e.
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
duty
of
fair
representation
this
court
has
implied
from
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
particular
it
concerns
the
end
of
a
long
and
bitter
strike
well-chronicled
in
the
press
between
the
air
line
pilots
association
and
continental
airlines
and
its
chief
executive,
mr.
lorenzo.
the
strike
began
in
'83
after...
1983
after
continental
went
into
bankruptcy
and
abrogated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
parties.
and
the
events
here
concern
the
situation
in
august,
september,
and
october
of
1985.
at
that
point,
the
union
was
faced
with
the
following
facts
of
life.
one,
despite
substantial
expense
and
unstinting
effort,
the
union
had
failed
to
significantly
affect
continental's
business.
secondly,
continental
at
that
point
had
1,600
working
pilots,
either
permanent
replacements
or
crossovers,
and
there
were
1,000
strikers.
third,
continental,
in
recognition
of
that,
had
withdrawn
recognition
of
the
union.
fourth,
continental
had
put
out
what
was
called
its
85-5
vacancy
bid
which
would
have
tied
up
all
the
most
desireable
jobs
in
the
air
line,
the
captain
and
first
officer
jobs,
for
the
foreseeable
future.
and
finally,
insofar
as
strikers
had
bid
for
those
jobs,
continental
had
sued
to
invalidate
those
bids
as
fraudulent.
against
that
background,
the
union,
after
internal
meetings
and
discussions,
authorized
the
negotiation
of
the
a
settlement.
as
matters
turned
out,
given
the
difficulties
to
only
be
expected
in
such
a
bitter
strike
and
with
such
a
large
company,
the
settlement
proceeded
under
the
auspices
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
which
had
jurisdiction
over
continental
at
that
point.
after
very
intensive
efforts,
a
long,
complex
document
emerged
called
the
order
and
award
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
order
and
award.
yes.
it
was
issued
as
an
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
it's
undisputed
that
all
but
two
of
its
terms
were
negotiated
between
the
parties,
but
it
was
under
the
auspices
of
the
court.
court
had
attempted
as
part
of
the
reorganization
as
far
back
as
july
to
get
the
parties
to
settle
this
dispute,
because
it
was
an
obstacle
to
reorganization.
and
finally
it
was
in
this
october
period
that
the
union
came
forward.
the
court
had
also
indicated
that
it
wanted,
if
it
was
going
to
put
its
efforts
into
it,
to
have
authorized
representatives
and
to
have
a
binding
conclusion
to
the
matter.
and
that,
too,
was
very
much
in
the
union's
interest
as
the
negotiators
saw
it,
because
of
the
grave
distrust
between
the
parties.
it
was
a
substantial
matter
to
the
union
that
whatever
was
concluded
would
be
enforceable,
because,
as
i
say,
the
level
of
distrust
between
mr.
lorenzo
and
alpa
was
substantial
at
the
time.
in
late
october
this
agreement
as
embodied
in
the
order
and
award
was
reached,
and
thereafter
this
lawsuit
followed.
the
lawsuit
was
brought
by
a
class
of
striking
pilots
alleging
that
the
union,
in
taking
the
course
that
it
did,
had
violated
the
statutory
duty
of
fair
representation.
after
18
months
of--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
and
we
acknowledge
that
and
we
acknowledge
the
bite
of
the
duty
in
terms
of
its
obligations
of
honesty
and
good
faith.
those...
those
aspects--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--not
arbitrariness
in
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals
understood
arbitrariness.
the
district
court,
after
extensive
discovery
and
on
the
union's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
concluded
that
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
union
made
any
choice
other
than
on
the
best
deal
that
the
union
thought
it
could
construct
and
on
that
view
of
the
standard
to
be
applied
determined
that
summary
judgment
was
appropriate.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
on
two
grounds.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
goes
not
only
to
the
union's
bona
fides,
but
also
provides
for
judicial
review
of
the
substance
of
the
union's
action.
as
the
court
put
it,
union
actions
must
be
based
on
relevant,
permissible
factors
and
must
be
a
rational
result
of
such
factors,
as
rational
was
determined
either
by
a
judge
or
a
jury.
and
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
a
finder
of
fact
could
find
that
the
agreement
put
members
in
a
substantially
worse
position
than
if
no
settlement
had
been
made
and
the
strike
had
been
abandoned
and
individuals
had
made
unconditional
offers
to
return.
in
addition,
the
court--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the...
well,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinions
said
that
the
union
proceeded
on
an
honest,
good-faith
determination
that
this
was
the
best
way
to
proceed
and
that
that
satisfied
the
standard.
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
other
hand
as
we
understand
it,
and
this
is
the
line
of
demarkation,
said
that
the
court
of...
the
trier
of
fact
should
have
determined
whether
this
deal
was
good
enough
when
compared
with
what
would
have
happened
hypothetically
in
the
event
that
the
union
had
made
an
unconditional
offer
to
return
to
work.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--as
we
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
the
host
of
uncertainties
and
the
nature
of
the
factors
that
are
to...
i'm
sorry,
the
role
of
the
host
of
uncertainties
that
the
union
and
the
striking
pilots
faced
and
the
calculus
of
factors
that
are
to
be
taken
into
account
are
both
disregarded.
we
don't
know
from
reading
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
what
goes
into
this
calculus.
and
that
is
one
of
our
prime
concerns.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
we
reach
that
point,
and
there
does
not
seem
in
this
case
to
be
any
evidence
opposing
that
conundrum,
that
the
union
is
entitled
to
take
into
account
the...
the
total
situation
of
the
pilots.
after
all,
these
are
people
following
or
calling
with
a
skill,
and
we
certainly
would
believe
that
if--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--with
all
deference,
that
isn't
what
i
said.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
i--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
think
the
union
can
take
into
account
the
total
labor
market
situation.
what
i
started
to
say
is
that
if
the
union
determines
that
tossing
in
the
towel
would
undermine
its
situation...
would
undermine
the
total
situation
facing
pilots
overall,
including
the
striking
pilots,
who
have
a
calling,
have
a
skill,
and
will
only
get
on
in
the
labor
market
for
that
calling
and
skill
what
the
union
is
able
to
do,
that
would
be
a
legitimate
consideration.
now
where
one
would
come
out
if
the
union
was
firmly
of
the
view
that
it
would
advance
the
situation
of
a
and
b
somewhere
else
while
harming
these
people,
i
find
a
much
more
difficult
question.
but
i
do
think
that,
in
a
world
in
which
you
have
competition
in
the
product
and
service
markets
for
the
union
be
forced
to
look
only
at
the
situation
of
the
particular
unit,
as
if
it
was
a
discrete
entity,
when
in
fact
it
isn't,
would
be
to...
wouldn't
be
to
further
the
notion
the
court
of
appeals
had,
mainly
a
rationality
standard.
it
would
be
to
require
the
union
to
proceed
in
a
way
that
is
irrational.
i
think
we're
very,
very
far
from
that
on
anything
in
this
case.
the
negotiators
proceeded
who
were
out
of
this
system's
board,
this
master
executive
counsel.
the
continental
system
appeared
to
proceed
and
took
their
view
as
they
were
trying
to
get
the
best
deal
that
they
could
get,
not
the
best
deal
for...
in
a
different
and
wider
perspective.
it's
our
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
subjecting
this
agreement
to
this
kind
of
substantive
scrutiny.
we
believe
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
as
the
court
said
in
steele,
is
a
duty
to
act
in
behalf
of
all
those
for
whom
it
acts
without
hostile,
namely
irrelevant
or
invidious,
discrimination
against
them.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
believe
that
they
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
the
word
arbitrary.
as
we
detail
in
our
brief
starting
on
page
14,
the
court
has
used
different
formulations
to
delineate
the
scope
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
the
court
has
used
the
word
arbitrary
in
doing
so.
we
believe
that
the
fairest
reading
of
all
the
cases
is
that
arbitrary
in
that
sense
means
hostile
action
against
an
individual
or
a
subgroup
of
the
bargaining
force.
in
other
words,
the
union
generally
processes
grievances
by
doing
certain
preliminary
steps.
an
individual
shows
that
without
any
justification,
any
reason,
the
union
doesn't
do
those
things
for
him
and
he
is
harmed.
we
would
think
that
that
is
arbitrary
and
that
it
adds
something
to
the
concept
of
discriminatory,
because
discrimination,
certainly
as
it
was
used
in
steele,
has
a
notion
of
a
class-based
wrong.
so
what
we
would
suggest
is
that
this
test
is
a
test
of
good
faith
and
honesty
of
purpose
as
the
court
said
in
ford
motor
and
that
what
arbitrary
means
is
that
discrimination,
which
is
either
class
based
or
is
simply
inexplicable
and
harmful,
is
a
wrong.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
the
essence
of
our
argument
is
that
this
duty
doesn't
create
a
liability
for
honest
mistakes,
so--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
we
make
three
different
arguments
in
support
of
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
here.
the
first
is
the
one
you've
just
stated.
the
second
is
that
at
the
very
least
this
test
of
honesty
and
good
purpose
ought
to
apply
in
the
most
complex
situations,
namely
the
negotiation
of
agreements
or
the
renegotiation
of
agreements
even
if
it
doesn't
apply
in
what
are
arguably
simpler
cases
involving
grievance
handling.
and
third,
we
argue
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
certainly
wrong
in
terms
of
the
way
it
understood
whatever
duty
of
adequate
representation
that
exists,
that
instead
of
looking
at
the
matter
in
terms
of
the
practical
and
legal
uncertainties
at
the
time,
looking
at
the
situation
that
actually
faced
the
union,
and
looking
also
at
the
fact
that
the
ultimate
agreement
provided
for
benefits
for
the
striking
employees
such
as
severance
pay,
recall
in
seniority
order,
and
so
on
that
were
not
legally
required,
that
this
was
not
an
agreement
which
was...
is
challengeable
even
under
a
duty
of
care.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
basically--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the...
as
we
understand
rawson,
justice
kennedy,
the
court
also
said
that
a
negligence
claim
would
not
be
actionable
under
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
it
was
not
simply
that
it
would
not
be...
there
would
be
an
actionable
state
law
claim.
so
that
the
standard
is
certainly,
from
what
we
know
from
this
court's
cases,
higher
than
negligence.
but
our--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
if
i
can,
there
are
two
things
i'd
like
to
say
about
that.
first
of
all,
as
we
attempt
to
develop
in
our
reply
brief,
the
wide
range
of
reasonableness
language
is
in
ford
motor
company...
this
is
at
pages
2
to
4
of
our
reply
brief.
and
the
context
there
was
to
determine
whether
a
distinction
between
veterans
or
nonveterans
was
a
distinction
which
was
invidious
and
irrelevant
or
relevant
to
the
union's
task.
so
the
reasonableness
was
in
setting
up
the
classifications.
as
we
point
out,
the
court
did
not
go
on
to
see
whether
veterans
got
too
much
seniority
or
too
little;
and
we
certainly
acknowledge
that,
in
terms
of
drawing
distinctions,
there
is
a
reasonableness
component.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
lockridge
case
which
is
the
last
case
which
fully
explores
the
nature
of
this
duty,
like
steele,
which
was
the
first
case,
talks
entirely
in
terms
of
honesty
and
good
faith.
in
terms
of
why
there
should
be
such
a
duty,
if
i
could
in...
given
justice
kennedy's
question,
we
believe
that
the
answer
is
that
this
is
a
statutory
duty,
and
it
comes
out
of
a
statute
whose
overriding
function
was
to
take
judges
and
juries
out
of
the
substance
of
labor
relations
and
to
put
those
tasks
into
the
hands
the
parties.
we
discuss
and
cite
the
h.k.
porter
case
and
senator
walsh's
famous
statement
there
that
the
act
takes
the
parties
to
the
negotiating
table
and
leaves
them
there.
to
have
judges
and
juries
saying
this
deal
is
not
good
enough,
even
though
it
was
honest,
even
though
it
was
based
on
a
fair
judgment
of
the
circumstances
and
that
you
had
to
do
it
a
different
way
is
to
get--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
fairness
in
the
sense
of--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--a
duty
of
loyalty,
fairness
in
the
sense
of--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--you
mean--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--we
believe
that
we
can
meet--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that
standard,
but
we're--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
no.
we
are
arguing
that
that
is
precisely
what
labor
relations
is
not
about.
there
are
a
lot
of
mean,
unfair
deals
out
there
when
you
take
into
account
that
the
company
had
the
power
and
the
union
had
less.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
that
is...
that
is
certainly
not
the
view...
the
view
you
just
stated
is
certainly
not
the
view
of
vaca
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
embraced
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
have
been
living
with
a
regime
which
is
going
to
end
with
this
case
one
way
or
another
in
which
different
courts
have
taken
different
views.
the
seventh
circuit,
for
example,
has
consistently
taken
the
view
that
i
have
just
outlined.
other
courts
have
been
back
and
forth,
some
distinguishing
between
negotiation
and
some
not.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it
had
up
until
the
thomas
case,
when
it
appeared
to
draw
a
distinction
between
negotiation
and
nonnegotiation.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
believe
there
is
subsequent
case
which
could
be
fairly
read
to
go
back
the
other
way,
but
i'm
not
positive.
i'd
like
to,
if
i
could,
save
a
moment
or
two
for
rebuttal.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
thank
you,
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
last
point
mr.
harper
made
is
very
important
in
terms
of
understanding
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
what
arbitrary
means.
the
whole
discussion
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
here
is
that
the
strikers
were
entitled
to
these
so-called
85-5
bids.
there
was
no
case
law
at
the
time
on
the
status
of
vacancy
bids
and
when
a
position
is
filled
and
when
it
isn't
in
the
complexities
of
the
bargaining
unit.
the
court
of
appeals
made
that
decision
as
if
the
union
knew
what
the
law
was.
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
for
it
after
the
fact
at
the
point
where
the
negotiators
could
not.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
is
on
both
the
arbitrariness
of
the
settlement
and
on
the
discrimination
point.
with
regard
to
the
discrimination
point,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
a
very
expansive
reading
of
erie
resistor,
which
this
court
later
rejected
in
the
ifa
case
just
last
year.
so,
this
would--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--trans
world
air
lines
v.
flight
attendants.
i
think
it's
489
u.s.--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
don't
think
it
assumed
it.
there
were
1,600
pages
of
deposition
records
or
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
showing
that
the
union
was
proceeding
on
the
basis
that
this
wasn't
locked
up,
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
hostile
employer,
and
that
making
a
deal
was
the
best
course.
that
was
his
finding
viewed
that
that
was
indisputed.
but--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--but
are
we
going
to
be
in
a
position
where
the
certainty
of
the
law
is
to
depend
on
whether
a
jury
says
that
a
single
district
court
decision
somewhere
else
makes
the
law
certain?
i
don't
think
that
at
all
the
court...
the
district
court
was
right
in
terms
of
understanding
that
there
was
uncertainty,
and
the
union
was
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
uncertainty.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
that
was
not
disputed.
the
only
dispute...
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
it
was
certain,
not
that
the
union
was
not
uncertain.
by
the
same
token,
we're
having
a
discussion
here,
and
mr.
harper
insists
on
having
a
discussion,
whether
this
deal
was
better
or
worse
than
an
unconditional
return
to
work.
the
master
executive
counsel
voted
against
an
unconditional
return
to
work
before
the
negotiators
went
to
negotiate.
and
that's
simply
part
of
the
problem
of
having--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--okay.
