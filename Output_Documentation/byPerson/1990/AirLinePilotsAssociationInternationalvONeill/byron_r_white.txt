justice
white
but
not
arbitrariness?
justice
white
you
don't
suggest
that
fairness
has
any
part
of
it,
do
you?
justice
white
is
it
[inaudible]--
justice
white
--i
know,
but
you
sounded
like
you
were
saying
substantively
it
was
fair.
justice
white
the
terms
agreed
upon
were
fair.
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
don't--
justice
white
--you
mean
judges
are
supposed
to
decide
whether
they
were
fair
or
not?
justice
white
oh,
it...
you
don't
really...
you've
been
living...
the
unions
have
been
living
with
this
vaca
standard
for
a
long
time,
and
i
have
noticed
in
all
the
cases
that
come
around
here
that
you've
been
really
hurt
very
much
by
that
element
in
it.
i
had
thought
the
judges
thought
about
arbitrariness
that
no
fool
in
his
right
mind
would
ever
have
agreed
to
this.
this
is
completely
irrational.
now,
that's
a...
that's
a...
that
isn't
looking
over
the
shoulders
of
the
union
or
really
second
guessing
you.
justice
white
that
may
be.
but
haven't
you
been
living
with
the
arbitrariness
standard
interpreted
in
that
way
for
a
long
time?
justice
white
does
the
seventh
circuit
go
right
across
the
board
with
this
test?
justice
white
well,
that's
the
last
case,
isn't
it?
justice
white
in
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
white
what
do
you
think
the
word
"arbitrary"
suggests
to
courts
of
appeals?
is...
are
they
supposed
just
to
say,
well,
the
union
is
guilty
or
is
liable
because
we
wouldn't
have
done
what
they
did?
justice
white
xxx
not
answering
my
question--
justice
white
--the
court
is
permitted
to
say,
well,
we
wouldn't
have
done
it
this
way
because
we
don't
think
it
was
reasonable?
justice
white
what
are
they...
what
should
they
say
then?
justice
white
well,
you
could...
could
you
live
with
a
standard
that
says
that
the
court
should
ask
if
any
rational
union
negotiator
could
possibly
have
come
to
this
conclusion?
justice
white
which
is
certainly
more
a...
that's
a...
that
gives
them
a
lot
more
room
than
insisting
that
they
have
to
be
reasonable.
justice
white
well,
if
a
union...
if
the
court
thinks
a...
that
there
are
factors
a
union...
they
think
the
union
didn't
consider,
shouldn't
they
also
ask,
well,
would
any
rational
person...
could
any
rational
person
have
put
those
factors
aside?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
fifth
circuit
was
true
to
that
position?
justice
white
there
was
a
triable
issue
of
fact
about
arbitrariness.
justice
white
and
about
discrimination.
justice
white
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
in
the
record
that
somebody
could
have
concluded
that
it
was
arbitrary,
defined
in
the
right
way.
justice
white
counsel,
do
you...
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
test
they
set
down
in
the
tedford
case?
justice
white
well,
that
test
is
a
three-part
test
that
says
to
be
nonarbitrary
the
decision
must
be
based
upon
relevant,
permissible
union
factors;
second,
a
rational
result
of
the
consideration
of
these
factors;
and
three,
and
inclusive
of
a
fair
and
impartial
consideration
of
the
interests
of
all
employees.
so
do
you
think
that...
you
think
a
court
has
to
get
to
the
issue
of
fairness
with
respect
to
the
various
groups
of
employees?
justice
white
well,
this
is...
what
the
tedford
test
is,
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
applied
so
they
have
a
free
wheeling...
they
can
just
decide
whether
it's
fair
or
not,
is
that
it?
non-arbitrary?
justice
white
well,
literally,
this
test
means
that
the
union...
even
if
the
union
took...
considered
all
relevant
factors
and
gave
rational
consideration
to
it,
nevertheless,
they
might
be
unfair,
an
unfair
result.
justice
white
they
could
if
they
had
a
multiemployer
bargaining
unit,
but
they
do
not.
justice
white
could
i
ask
you...
do
you
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
as
saying
that
the...
that
there's
evidence
of
discrimination
as
an
independent
reason
for
reversing
the
district
court?
justice
white
what
do
you
think
discrimination
means
in
that
sense?
is
it...
it's
intentional
discrimination?
invidious
discrimination
or
hostile
or
what
is
it?
