justice
souter
mr.
harper,
are
you
saying
that
in
affirming
the
result
below
as
you
want
us
to
do,
we
could
do
so
consistently
with
your
position
and
still
repudiate
the
second
of
the
factors
which
the
court
of
appeals
considered?
in
other
words,
could
you
get
where
you
want
to
go
and
in
fact
are
you
arguing
that
you
should
get
where
you
want
to
go
by
having
us
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
a
non-arbitrary
decision
must
be
based
on
relevant
factors,
but
repudiate
that
second
part
of
the
test
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
that
it
must
also
be
a
rational
result
of
considering
those
factors?
do
you
want
to
jettison
point
2
and
still
win?
justice
souter
but
if--
justice
souter
--well,
then
i
guess
i'm
having
the
same
trouble
then
that
i
think
has
been
expressed
earlier
in
this
argument.
you
apparently
want
us
to
go
beyond
or
want
courts
to
go
beyond
a
finding
that
the
appropriate
factors
were
considered.
you
want
us...
you
want
the
courts
to
intrude
to
some
degree
into
a...
an
assessment
of
the
results
achieved
by
considering
those
factors,
don't
you?
justice
souter
and
are
you
satisfied...
going
back
to
justice
white's
question,
would
you
be
satisfied
if
the
court
stopped
at
saying
this
is
one
possible
result
within
the
realm
of
reasonableness
so
that
if
that
test
were
satisfied,
that
would
be
the
extent
of
the
court's
scrutiny?
