justice
stevens
mr.
nordyke,
before
you
go
to
the
eighth
amendment--
justice
stevens
--i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
you
contend
that
there's
a
liberty
interest
created
by
louisiana
law,
i
understand.
do
you
also
contend
independently
of
louisiana
law
that
there's
a
liberty
interest
in
not
being
subjected
to
this
medication?
justice
stevens
you
didn't
seem
to
mention
it
and
i
was--
justice
stevens
in
your
second
purpose,
let
me
be
sure
i
have
it
correct.
is
it
not
correct
that
when
he
is
receiving
the
medication,
he
is
competent
to
make
a
decision?
justice
stevens
and
that
while
he
was
competent
he
did
indicate
a
desire
not
to
receive
further
medication?
justice
stevens
the
finding
in
october
of
whatever
it
was,
the
18th
or
21st,
that
he
was
competent
to
understand
the
punishment,
of
course,
execution,
is
not
equivalent
of
a
finding
he
was
competent
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
wanted
further
treatment
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
well,
i
had
the
impression
that
there
were
times
when
he
was
competent
to
make
rational
decisions.
and
one
of
which
would
be
to
understand
the
execution.
the
other
would
be
whether
or
not
he
wanted
further
treatment
or
to
object
to
it.
and
i
thought
that
the
finding
by
the
judge
that
he
was
competent
for
execution
would
implicitly
indicate
that
he
also
found
him
competent
to
decide
whether
he
wanted
further
treatment
or
not.
justice
stevens
but
is
it
not
correct
that
during
one
of
these
periods
of
competency
under
medication,
he
made
it
clear
that
he
did
not
want
further
medication?
justice
stevens
if
we
assume
that
we
take
the
case
as
we've
discussed
in
acknowledging
that
maybe
the
record
isn't
as
clear
as
it
should
be,
would
it
be
your
view
that
at
that
time
he
had
the
kind
of
liberty
interest
independent
of
louisiana
law
that
was
discussed
in
harper
to
say
no
unless
sufficient
overriding
state
interests
are
present?
justice
stevens
so
you're
prepared,
really,
to
have
us
judge
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest
at
stake,
but
that
it's
overcome
by
the
countervailing
interest
that
you
rely
on?
justice
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
in
that
situation
one
of
the
factors
that
would
be
considered
would
be,
if
appropriate
in
the
case,
the
potential
permanent
side
effects
of
the
first
medication?
i
guess
these
things
affect
different
people
in
different
ways.
and
if
the
doctors
felt
it
would
cause
permanent
side
effects,
you
wouldn't
then
argue
that
the
mere
fact
they
wanted
to
make
him
competent
to
stand
trial
would
necessarily
overcome
his
liberty
interest,
would
you?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt,
if
i
may.
justice
stevens
you
seem
to
make
a
point
earlier
that
it
was
relevant
that
this
treatment
was
beneficial
to
him.
what
if
it
wasn't
beneficial?
you'd
have
the
same
state
interest
in
carrying
out
the
punishment.
justice
stevens
i
can
understand
your
argument
if
you
don't
rely
on
the
benefit.
but
it's
a
rather
strange
sort
of
benefit
to
say
the
benefit
is
you
may
now
be
executed.
justice
stevens
he's
not
particularly
interested
in
those
when
he
is
weighing
the
various
alternatives.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
i
know
medication
to
go
to
trial,
justice
scalia
has
already
demonstrated,
that's
a
harder
case
than
this
one.
justice
stevens
you're
relying
on
one
that
hasn't
been
decided
yet,
at
least
by
this
court.
justice
stevens
it
isn't
the
state's
interest
is
heightened.
it's
that
his
interest
is.
the
interest
in
turning
down
harmful
medication
is
certainly
something
much
greater
than
the
interest
in
turning
down
otherwise
beneficial
medication,
and
as...
the
punishment
authorized
by
this
judgment
against
the
defendant
was
execution,
right?
justice
stevens
i
don't
mean
to
be
a
pest
here.
i
really
don't.
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
got
a
thought
in
mind.
reading
the
trial
court's
order,
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
of
as
to
be
prescribed
by
the
medical.
we're
talking
about
the
order
of
page
148
i
think
of
the--
justice
stevens
--october
21.
and
it
says
the
department
of
public
safety
and
corrections
is
further
ordered
to
maintain
the
defendant
on
the
above
medication
as
to
be
prescribed
by
the
medical
staff
of
the
department
of
if
necessary
administers
that
medication
forcibly
to
defendant
over
his
objection.
are
you
arguing
that
as
to
be
prescribed
means
if
the
medical
staff
thinks
it's
beneficial?
justice
stevens
you
think
that's
implicit
in
the
order?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
