we'll
hear
argument
now
on
no.
89-5120,
michael
owen
perry
v.
louisiana.
mr.
nordyke,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
it
your
contention
that
the
louisiana
trial
court
which
authorized
the
medication
is
acting
in
violation
of
louisiana
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
not
one
we
would
be
likely
to
entertain.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
argue
that
in
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
briefed
the
argument
that
the
louisiana
statute
set
up
a
liberty
interest
which
gave
you
a
right
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
you
believe
we
did.
are
you
uncertain
about
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
that's
quite
different
than
briefing
the
argument
that
830.1
creates
a
liberty
interest
which
would
in
turn
give
you
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
could
you
supply
us
with
a
transcript
citation?
not
at
this
moment,
but
after
the
argument?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you're
arguing
that
the
louisiana
court
did
not
follow
the
louisiana
law?
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
talking
now
about
some
sort
of
a
liberty
interest?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
making
any
argument
that
we
should
review
this
as
a
decision
based
on
louisiana
law,
that
the
court
interpreted
the
statute
incorrectly?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--did
you
make
that
argument
in
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
make
the
argument
even
though
harper
was
not
decided?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
will
you
furnish
us
a
transcript?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
nordyke.
mr.
salomon,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
salomon.
mr.
nordyke,
you
have
rebuttal.
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nordyke.
the
case
is
submitted.
