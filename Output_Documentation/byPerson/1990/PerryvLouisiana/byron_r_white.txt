justice
white
and
i
would
like
to
know
if
you...
if
the
issue
came
up
before
the
supreme
court.
justice
white
well,
the
predicate
for
your
argument,
though,
is
what
louisiana
does.
louisiana
does...
you
claim
louisiana
set
up
a
liberty
interest
and
you
claim
that
the
trial
court
didn't
follow
it.
justice
white
did
the
trial
court
enter
more
than...
what
was
its
very
final
order
about
medication?
justice
white
i
mean
one
of
the
orders
was
stayed,
but--
justice
white
--what
does
the
last
one
say?
justice
white
right
at
the
end
it
says
about...
doesn't
it
say
that--
justice
white
--it
says
this
order,
the
one
that
stayed
in
existence...
to
maintain
treatment
as
prescribed
by
medical
staff.
justice
white
oh,
i
didn't...
do
you
think
that
requires
a
medical
staff
to
prescribe
treatment?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
they
wouldn't
be
in
violation
of
the
order
if
they
said...
if
they
decided
that
the
patient
didn't
need
it.
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
say
so.
it
just
says
that
whatever
treatment
the
medical
staff
wants
to
prescribe,
they
are
supposed
to
go
ahead
and
do
it.
that's
just
sort
of--
justice
white
well,
there's
no
indication
of
any
finding
that
he
would
be
of
danger
to
himself
or
others?
justice
white
so
you
think...
why
don't
you
win
the
case
just
on
that
basis,
that
the
judge
ordered
treatment
which
was
against
his
will
without
the
proper
findings?
justice
white
well,
you
just...
forget
about
the
state
statute.
justice
white
well,
do
you?
have
you?
justice
white
do
you
think
there
was
a
duty
under
louisiana
law
or
any
other
law,
including
the
constitutional
law,
for
the
doctors
to
treat
this
man?
justice
white
so
the
medical
staff
is
probably
doing
what
they
thought
they
should
be
doing
to
him.
justice
white
and
he
hasn't
been
refusing
them?
justice
white
when
a
case
comes
to
us,
don't
we
judge
it
on
the
basis
that
this
treatment
would
make
him
at
least
temporarily
competent?
i
know
you
challenge
that.
but
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
isn't
that--
justice
white
--but
that's
just
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
justice
white
but
there's
no
specific
finding
that
he
would
be
dangerous
to
himself
or
others?
justice
white
but
you
are
saying
that
even
if
there
isn't,
the
state's
interest
in
executing
him
is
sufficient
to
override
his
denial
of
the
medication?
justice
white
that's
certainly
what
the
judge
said,
isn't
it?
justice
white
i
don't
know.
i
can't
imagine
why
the
judge
would
go
to
the
trouble
of
saying
that
the
state's
interest
overrode
his
decision,
his
interest
in
refusing
treatment,
if
that
weren't
the
case.
justice
white
at
least
i
would
think
that's
the
way
we
would
judge
this
case.
justice
white
then
why
do
you
say
830.1
isn't
applicable?
i
didn't
quite
get
it.
justice
white
but
the
830.1
sort
of
conditions
involuntary
treatment
on--
justice
white
--the
basis
of
dangerousness.
justice
white
and
is
quite
consistent
with
the
constitutional
rule.
justice
white
at
least
that's
your
submission?
justice
white
well,
are
there
any
decisions
under
federal
law
that...
are
there
any
decisions
saying
that
this
is
consistent
with
federal
and
constitutional
law?
justice
white
you
don't
really
know
that.
you
don't
really
know
that
those
laws
apply
when
the
patient
refuses
and
he's
not
dangerous.
