blackmun
well,
i
don't
see
that
it
reads,
"as
prescribed
by
the
medical
staff.
"
it
reads,
"as

"
i
think
that's
susceptible
of
a
very
different
connotation.
justice
blackmun
of
course,
mr.
nordyke,
it
never
really
makes
much
sense,
does
it,
in
some
respects,
to
cure
a
man
only
to
execute
him.
justice
blackmun
and
the
problem,
of
course,
is
the
old
rule
that
you
don't
execute
a
man
when
he's
incompetent.
justice
blackmun
the
trouble
may
be
with
the
old
rule.
but
there
it
is,
engraved
in
stone,
i
suppose.
why
shouldn't
we
execute
a
man
when
he's
incompetent?
justice
blackmun
did
you
draw
the
order?
justice
blackmun
who
did?
justice
blackmun
who
did?
justice
blackmun
himself?
justice
blackmun
that
is
your
louisiana
practice?
justice
blackmun
attorneys
never
draw
an
order?
justice
blackmun
you
know
that
of
your
own
knowledge?
