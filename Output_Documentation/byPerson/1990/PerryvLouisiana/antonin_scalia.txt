justice
scalia
--is
it
clear
on
the
face
of
this
statute
that
there's
no
exception
to
that
when
a
prisoner
has
been
condemned
to
execution--
justice
scalia
--and
which
exception
can
be
made
by
the
state's
supreme
court?
justice
scalia
but,
you
know,
we
have
interpreted
federal
statutes
to
permit
some
exceptions.
the
case
that
we
heard
argued
today
urges
exceptions
from
what
is
normally
a
general
rule.
why
can't
the
state
say
that
this
statute
which
prohibits
involuntary
treatment
except
where
the
person
is
a
danger
to
himself
or
others,
why
can't
the
state
court
say,
well,
as
we
interpret
it
it's
not
meant
to
apply
to
the
case
of
a
condemned
prisoner,
who
so
long
as
the
treatment
does
not
harm
him
and
improves
his
condition
is
not
entitled
to
refuse
it
simply
because
he
doesn't
want
to
be
made
healthy,
because
if
he's
made
healthy,
he'll
be
executed.
seems
a
perfectly
reasonable
exception.
why
can't
the
state
supreme
court
make
it?
justice
scalia
i
don't--
justice
scalia
--what...
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
make
it?
the
intermediate
court
couldn't
or
the
trial
court
couldn't?
justice
scalia
well,
why
couldn't
the
trial
court
make
it
and
the
supreme
court
agree
with
it
and
simply
turn
down
the
appeal?
justice
scalia
and
district
courts
in
louisiana
have
no
power
to
pronounce
the
law?
justice
scalia
it
depends
upon
your
reading
of
the
court's
order...
what
justice
white
was
asking
you
about
as
prescribed.
i
don't
think
that
must
be
read
to
say,
you're
going
to
get
this
treatment
even
if
it
isn't
in
your
medical
interest.
i
read
it
as
saying,
if
it's
in
your
medical
interest,
you
will
get
this
treatment
even
though
you
want
to
turn
it
down
because
you
know
that
if
you
get
better
you'll
be
executed.
i
think
it's
perfectly
reasonable,
don't
you,
to
read
it
the
other
way
when
it
says
as
prescribed.
justice
scalia
i
think
he's
talking
about
what
mr.
perry
was
arguing,
and
that
is
a
right
to
turn
down
even
beneficial
treatment
because
he
didn't
want
to
get
well.
that's
what
the
issue,
as
i
understood
it,
before
the
court
was,
and
it's
what
you're
arguing
here
that
he
has
a
right
to
turn
down
even
beneficial
treatment
because
he
doesn't
want
to
get
well.
don't
you
support
that
position
that
even
if
it
is
in
his
medical
interest
to
get
the
treatment,
he
has
a
right
to
turn
it
down?
is
that
not
your
position
here?
justice
scalia
and
i
think...
and
i
understood
it
to
be
the
position
below
and
i
understood
that
to
be
what
the
district
judge
was
addressing.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
under
this
order,
the
physician
said,
boy,
we
have
to
pump
the
medication
into
this
fellow
no
matter
what
it
does
to
him?
justice
scalia
do
you
really
think
that
that's
how
that
order
would
have
read
by
a
medical
doctor?
justice
scalia
but
don't
you
have
to
know
to
base
your
argument
on
that,
and
to
assert
as
you've
asserted
in
your
brief
that
the
whole
purpose
of
treatment
was
not
at
all
to
make
him
well,
although
that
would
kill
him
as
you
say,
because
if
he
got
well,
he
could
be
executed.
but
that
wasn't
the
purpose.
the
purpose
was
simply
to
have
him,
even
if
it
hurt
him
enormously,
to
have
him
rational
for
one
brief
instance
so
he
could
be
executed.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
record
that
justifies
that.
mr.
nordyke,
in
that
respect
there
has
been
discussion
up
here
about
the
wording
of
the
order.
it
is
the
order
of
october
21,
'88,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
to
be...
as
to
be
prescribed
means
as
to
be
prescribed
contrary
to
all
sound
medical
practice
if
necessary.
that's...
do
you
thing
a
reasonable--
justice
scalia
--was
there
testimony
that
any
doctor
treating
him
interpreted
the
order
that
way?
justice
scalia
you
know,
there's
a
consensus
against
killing
people,
too.
but
when
a
state
has
authorized
capital
punishment,
why
is
it
so
outrageous
as
to
be
unconstitutional
to
say
an
individual
may
not
turn
down
normal
treatment
that
he
would
otherwise
receive?
not
treatment
that
wouldn't
otherwise
be
justified
but
treatment
which
doctors
would
normally
recommend.
a
person
may
not
turn
that
down
solely
in
order
to
escape
the
electric
chair.
why
is
that
so
outrageous?
justice
scalia
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
handled
under
the
medical
model?
do
you
mean
that
the
state
would
have
to
adopt
a
rule
that
all
prisoners,
and
not
merely
those
who
have
been
condemned
to
death,
can
be
forcibly
medicated?
justice
scalia
i'm
saying
that
if
the
state
makes
a
determination
on
the
basis
of
expert
medical
advice
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
this
patient
because
of
his
mental
condition
to
be
medicated,
and
that
they
would
normally
advise
an
individual
in
private
life
outside
of
prison
to
obtain
medication,
that
thereafter
that
medication
may
be
forcibly
administered
to
someone
who
is
under
sentence
of
death,
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
turn
it
down.
just
as
a
normal
citizen
acting
reasonably
would
take
the
medication,
he
should
have
to
take
it
and
not
be
able
to
avoid
it
merely
in
order
to
avoid
the
death
penalty
that's
been
duly
imposed.
justice
scalia
of
course,
but
he's
been
condemned
to
punishment.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--it's
not
doing
to
him
anything
except
what
normal
medical
advice
would
justify
being
done.
justice
scalia
i
guess
the
issue
is
whether
someone
who's
been
condemned
to
death
continues
to
have
that
luxury.
justice
scalia
do
you
agree
it's
a
luxury?
justice
scalia
refuse
healthful
medication?
i
mean
that's
the
condition
on
all
my
questions.
that
it's
indeed
in
his
good
and
it
would
be
recommended
to
the
normal
patient.
justice
scalia
mr.
salomon,
did
the
court
specifically
hold
that
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
law,
830.1
was
inapplicable?
justice
scalia
in
a
way
competency
to
go
to
trial
is
harder,
isn't
it.
i
mean
here
you
have
a
person
who
has
not
been
convicted
of
anything,
and
you're
enforcing
involuntary
medication.
in
the
other
case,
you
have
someone
who's
already
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
thereby
loses
some
of
his
liberties,
including
physical
liberty
to
move
about.
justice
scalia
saying,
likewise
is
reduced
his
ability
to
turn
down
beneficial
medical
treatment.
justice
scalia
and
not
any
other
physical
torture
or
harm
beyond
execution
or
prior
to
execution.
correct?
justice
scalia
and
if
you
medicated
him
against
his
will
in
a
way
that
was
harmful
to
him
that
could
be
considered
to
be
something
beyond
the
judgment
of
execution
that
had
been
pronounced.
