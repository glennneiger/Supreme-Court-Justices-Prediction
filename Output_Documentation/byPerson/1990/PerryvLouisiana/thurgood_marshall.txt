justice
marshall
do
you
appoint
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
medication
is
to
put
him
in
condition
to
be
killed?
justice
marshall
but
the
primary
purpose
is
to
kill
him?
justice
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
is
this
medicine
given
by
injection
or
by
the
mouth?
justice
marshall
well,
if
all
you
say
is
true
in
the
interest
of
louisiana,
while
you're
giving
him
the
injection,
why
don't
give
him
enough
to
kill
him
then?
justice
marshall
it
would
be
cheaper
for
the
state.
justice
marshall
you
say
that
a
prisoner
who
isn't
dangerous
involuntarily
be
treated
in
order
to
make
him
competent
to
go
to
trial?
justice
marshall
the
state's
sole
interest
was
to
kill
him?
justice
marshall
well,
it
seems...
for
example,
if
he
had
been
sentenced
to
life,
the
state
wouldn't
be
interested,
would
they?
justice
marshall
they
would?
they
would
insist
on
it?
justice
marshall
do
you
think
they
would?
justice
marshall
in
this
case
it's
solely
to
kill
him?
