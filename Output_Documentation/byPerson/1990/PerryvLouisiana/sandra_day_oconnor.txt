justice
o'connor
mr.
nordyke,
there
is
a
louisiana
statute,
is
there
not,
that
deals
with
forcible
medication
of
prisoners?
justice
o'connor
was
that
section
called
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
that
statute
governs
in
this
situation,
or
should
govern?
justice
o'connor
was
there
ever
a
finding
here
that
the
forcible
medication
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
prisoner,
and
was
there
ever
a
finding
here
to
the
effect
that
the
prisoner
would
be
a
danger
to
himself
or
others
without
it?
justice
o'connor
where
do
i
find
the
court's
determination?
justice
o'connor
you
can't
point
to
any
specific
language?
justice
o'connor
second
order?
justice
o'connor
and
it's
the
finding
that
the
defendant
would
be
a
danger
to
himself
or
others
without
the
medication?
justice
o'connor
so
it
is
your
position
that
the
statute
830.1
is
inapplicable?
justice
o'connor
is
it
your
position
also
that
the
court's
findings
in
all
respects
comply
with
the
case
handed
down
by
this
court
last
term,
the
harper
case?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
the
harper
case
is
applicable
in
the
pretrial
situation?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
it
is
logically?
justice
o'connor
is
the
defendant
being
forcibly
medicated
now,
mr.
salomon?
