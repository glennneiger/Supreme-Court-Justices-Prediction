mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
louisiana
may,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
executing
an
inmate,
forcibly
medicate
a
mentally
ill
inmate
with
psychotropic
drugs.
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
confirming
conviction
and
sentence
on
direct
appeal,
restated
that
louisiana
does
not
execute
the
insane,
and
invited
inquiry
as
to
competency
to
be
executed.
the
trial
court
on
its
own
motion
determined
that
mr.
perry
has
met
the
threshold
test
of
ford
v.
wainwright
as
adopted
by
louisiana
and
held
a
hearing
to
determine
competency
to
be
executed.
the
result
of
that
hearing
was
an
order
which
we
contend
is
without
any
limits,
without
any
exercise
of
medical
judgment,
without
review,
without
any
ability
to
terminate
medication,
that
is,
without
the
medical
approach
that
this
court
has
previously
used.
that
order
said
that
the
medical
staff
of
the
louisiana
state
penitentiary
should
medicate
mr.
perry
with
the
drug
haldol
solely
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
him
for
execution.
mr.
perry
has
schizoaffective
disorder,
which
is
a
major
mental
illness
that
is
incurable.
there
are
two
major
components
to
this
disorder,
the
first
of
which
is
a
mood
component...
we
commonly
think
of
it
as
a
bipolar
disorder
or
manic
depressive...
and
the
second
is
a
psychotic
component
where
mr.
perry
has
delusions,
has
auditory
hallucinations,
and
very
often
does
not
know
where
he
is.
it's
also
marked
by
very
strong
ambivalence,
meaning
that
he
cannot
say
consistently
and
know
consistently
from
one
minute
to
the
next
the
same
thing.
the
classic
example
that
appears
throughout
the
record
is
mr.
perry
on
the
one
hand
will
say,
i
killed
my
mother
and
my
father,
and
within
the
same
sentence
will
say,
for
$20,000
i'll
tell
you
who
killed
my
mother
and
my
father.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
initially
stayed
the
forcible
medication
order
in
this
case
and
then
denied
writ.
under
louisiana
law
a
writ
denial
is
not
to
be
considered
an
expression
of
the
law.
the
tension
in
this
case
as
petitioner
sees
it
is
the
pitting
of
the...
the
medication
model
of
treatment
versus
the
punitive
model
of
treatment.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
yes,
ma'am,
title
xv,
section
830.1.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor,
we
briefed
that
section
consistently
throughout
and
the
only
time
the
trial
court
used
the
word
was
in
an
august
26th
hearing
where
he
ordered
forcible
medication
and
he
just
simply
said,
in
accordance
with
830.1,
i
order
the
forcible
medication.
the
problem
with
him
simply
doing
that
is
that
830.1
sets
up
a
whole
panoply
of
due
process
protections
virtually
similar
to
the
harper
decision
last
year.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor,
from
day
1
in
this
case
we
have
taken
that
precise
position.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
prongs
to
that
and
it's
the
same
two
prongs
that
your
honor
wrote
about
in
harper
last
term.
first,
we
have
the
best
interest
component
and
secondly,
the
danger
to
self
and
others
component.
the
record
in
our
case
is
absolutely
barren
of
either.
there
is
no
finding
of
best
interest
and
no
finding
of
danger
to
self
or
others
by
the
trial
court.
it's
simply
an
order
that
calls
for
punishment.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor,
it's--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--if
we're
asking
about
the
pennhurst
problem,
the
answer
is
no.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
louisiana
has
set
up
a
statutory
scheme
in
title
xv
830.1
and
title
xxviii,
section
59,
which
is
a
companion
statute
to
830.1,
that
specifically
deal
with
the
forcible
medication
of
prisoners
in
the
event
that
they
refuse
and
that
those
statutes
set
up
a
liberty
interest
that's
protective--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--yes,
your
honor,
we
have
briefed
those
issues--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--i
believe
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
i
am,
your
honor.
i
don't
remember
the
first
brief,
but
i
am
almost
certain...
i
know
that
we
briefed
830.1.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
we
will
file
that
with
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
definitely
it
came
up
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
your
honor.
we
briefed...
the
brief
that
we
filed
in
this
court
is
very
similar
to
the
brief
that
we
filed
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
has
virtually
all
the
same
arguments,
including
the
due
process
argument,
the
state
created
liberty
interest.
we
take
the
position
that
the
order's
sole
purpose
is
for
purposes
of
punishment.
the
sole
reason
that
the
trial
court
ordered
this
medication
is
to
attempt
to
change
the
man,
to
change
the
mind
of
this
individual
for
the
government's
purposes.
the
injections
that
the
state
wants
to
give
mr.
perry
are
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
execute
mr.
perry
and,
therefore,
become
a
step
in
his
punishment
and
part
of
the
execution
that,
to
our
mind,
are
not
part
of
the
louisiana
law,
not
authorized
by
louisiana
law.
the
second
major
point
that
we
want
to
make
in
terms
of
showing
its
sole
purpose
is
for
punishment
is
that
no
prison
physicians
have
ordered
this.
as
was
pointed
out
a
second
ago,
louisiana
does
have
a
statute
which
we
claim
sets
up
a
liberty
interest,
and
that
statute
sets
up
the
medical
model
that
this
court
has
consistently
set
up
in
vitek
and
harper
and
youngberg
and--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
no,
your
honor.
we're
saying
we
were
denied
the
expectation
that
the
louisiana
statute
gave
us.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
i
may...
i
may
be
saying
it
incorrectly.
i
may
be
using
the
shorthand
of
talking
about
louisiana
law,
but
when
i
say
that,
what
i'm
discussing
is
the
liberty
interest.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
oh,
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
not
at
all.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
that's
no
different
than
the
liberty
interest
that
was
set
up
in
harper
last
term
or
set
up
in
many
of
the
due
process
cases
that
involve
state
statutes
as
long
as
it
has
the
mandatory
language
in
the...
in
the
predicates.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
the
precise
wording,
your
honor,
was--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--okay,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
two
orders
entered.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
the
last
order
is
fairly
lengthy.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
to
be
prescribed
by
the
medical
staff--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that's...
i
don't
think
that
solves
the
problem
by
any
stretch
of
the--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--i
think
it
orders
them
to
prescribe
treatment
as
opposed
to
use
medical
judgment.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
because
the
preceding
two
sentences--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--well,
that
still
denies
the
liberty
interest
that
the
statute
that
we've
been
discussing
sets
up.
the
statute
sets
up,
basically,
the
involuntary
commitment
statute
that
justice
blackmun
discussed
last
term
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
harper
as
being
sort
of
a
cure-all
to
this
problem
of
forcible
medication.
and
that's
what
this
statute
for
criminals...
the
inmates
does.
it
sets
up
basically
first
an
emergency
procedure
for
the
first
15
days
and
after
that
it
sets
up
basically
an
involuntary
commitment
process.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
there
is
no
exception
whatsoever
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
and
in
addition,
both
830.1
and
title
xxviii,
section
59,
were
amended
subsequent
to
ford
v.
wainwright.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
the
state
supreme
court
perhaps
could,
but
they
have
not.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
never
spoken
on
this
statute.
they
perhaps
could
make
such
an
exception,
but
they
haven't.
and
the
fact
that
they
denied
writs
in
this
case
means
nothing.
they
are
completely
a
discretionary
court.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
a
writ
denial
under
louisiana
law
has
no--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--your
honor,
i
guess
they
could
say
that,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
a
valid
expression
of
louisiana
law
particularly
coming
out
of
the
trial
court.
the
court
of
appeals
perhaps
could.
but
this
sort
of
case
would
not
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
goes
on
direct
writs
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
because
louisiana
law,
as
i
say,
your
honor,
does
not
consider
a
writ
denial
to
be
an
expression
of
the
law
at
all.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor,
under
our
civilian
system
of
law
in
louisiana...
and
i
realize
this
is
a
criminal
constitutional
issue...
but
under
our
general
proposition
of
how
courts
make
law
in
louisiana,
we
are
a
civilian
system
and
we
generally
follow
statutes,
and
if
there
is
no
statute,
the
court
generally
does
not
go
forth
and
make
law
on
it.
they
have
to
usually
go
from
a
statute
and
analogize
from
a
statute.
you
know,
what
your
honor
i
think
says
is
interesting
and
this
is
that
if
the
court
were
to
say
the
statute
is
silent
and
we're
going
to
go
ahead
and
allow
this
as
an
exception,
then
what
it
does,
i
think,
is
clearly
make
part
of
the
punishment
this
medication.
and
what
we
are
doing
is
we
are
at
this
point
adding
a
punishment
not
authorized
by
statute.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
no,
your
honor,
i
don't,
because
the
preceding
two
paragraphs...
i
guess
two
paragraphs
back
in
the
order...
the
trial
court
said
that
he
doesn't
waive
mr.
perry's
interest,
doesn't
look
at
mr.
perry's
interest.
he
says,
whatever
interests
mr.
perry
has
i
find
they
are
outweighed
by
the
right
of
louisiana
to
effectuate
its
jury
verdict.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
but
i
have
to
qualify
that.
as
long
as
it's
in
his
medical
best
interest
and
there's...
showing
that
he's
dangerous
to
self
or
others,
then
of
course
the
state
can
do
that
under
the
statute
and
under
harper.
there's
no
showing--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--the
record
is
barren
of
that,
your
honor.
the
record...
the
trial
court's
ruling
is
barren
of
that,
of
course.
and
we
think
the
record
is
barren
of
that
also.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor,
we
could.
we
could
under
the
liberty--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--if
you're
talking
about
the
substantive
fourteenth
amendment
due
process,
absolutely
we
could.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
i
think
so,
your
honor.
we've
argued
in
brief
that
we
certainly
have
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
substantive
due
process
problem.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
if
your
honor
is
asking
about
what
the
state
has
raised,
the
estelle
v.
gamble
1983
problem,
i
think
that
there
is
a
statutory
duty
under
louisiana
revised
statutes
where
physicians...
for
the
state
penitentiary
to
provide
proper
care
for
mr.
perry.
but
there
is
a
concomitant
ability
of
mr.
perry
to
turn
down
that
treatment
if
he
wishes
to
under
the
same
statutes,
under
the
same
statutory
scheme.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--not
the
first
time,
your
honor.
the
first
time
that
i
wrote
the
letter
to
request
that
he
not
take
medication,
which
was
in
march
of
1988,
the
reason
that
was
done
was
that
mr.
perry
was
having
discomfort.
he
was
feeling
really
bad
on
the
medication.
the
first
time
that
i
ever
met
this
client
was
in
january
of
1988,
and
he
was
agitated
and
having
the
side
effect
of...
the
intense
agitation
of
this
medication
and
i
looked
at
the
statute
and
found
830.1
and
wrote
a
letter
saying,
let's
discontinue
him
from
the
medication.
the
second
time
i
didn't
discontinue
him
from
the
medication.
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
state
penitentiary
asking
that
they
not
medicate
him
absent
compliance
with
830.1.
and
the
final
time
that
your
honor
might
be
talking
about
is
when
there
was
a
last
hearing,
i
believe,
and
one
of
the
doctors
made
some
comment
about
what
i
said.
i
didn't
say
that.
that
may
be
mr.
perry's
auditory
delusions,
but
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
yes,
there...
well,
yes,
there
is,
if
you
consider
the
fact
that
if
he
takes
the
medication
under
the
trial
court's
findings,
that
it
will
kill
him,
that
will
inevitably
and
inexorably
lead
to
his
death.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
we
don't
know,
because
his
best
interests
were
not
a
focus
of
any
of
the
hearings.
none
of
the
hearings
that
we
had
focused
on
what
mr.
perry...
what
was
good
for
mr.
perry,
what
was
bad
for
mr.
perry,
how
much
was
good,
how
much
was
bad.
the
problem
is
that
we
didn't
use
the
medical
model
throughout.
as
your
honor
knows
from
the
harper
case
last
term,
this
sort
of
medication
has
got
problems
with
it.
it's
got
side
effects.
it's
got
dangers.
and
the
use
of
these
medications,
as
dangerous
as
they
are,
may
be
good
for
inmates
under
some
circumstances.
but
it's
a
constant
push
and
pull
and
a
tension,
a
medical
risk
reward
analysis,
that
the
physicians
need
to
undertake
and
that
wasn't
done.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
i
think--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
how
a
medical
doctor
would
have
read
it,
but
the
import
of
the
order--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is.
and
i
think,
justice
scalia,
the
answer
is
basically
what
was
just
proposed.
the
order,
as
i
understand
it
and
reading
it
as
a
whole
in
pari
materia,
basically
says
they
go
forth
and
medicate
him.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
i
can't
read
it
any
other
way
simply
because
the
trial
court,
knowing
about
830.1,
having
had
it
briefed
to
him,
didn't
go
through
any
of
the
things
that
one
needs
to
go
through
under
830.1.
he
didn't
look
at
any
of
the
issues.
this
simply
wasn't
that
sort
of
hearing.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
well,
your
honor,
the
trial
court...
excuse
me,
the
trial
court
stayed
his
order
after
entry,
so
we
don't
know.
now,
mr.
perry
has
been
medicated
since
then,
but
under
whose
authority
or
why,
i
don't
know.
but
theoretically
this
order
is
stayed
even
through
today.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
i
don't
know.
as
of
2
weeks
ago--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--they
are
forcibly
injecting
him,
we
understand.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor,
we
claim
it's
fundamentally
wrong.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
it
goes
back
to
ford.
it
goes
back
to
ford
in
the
common
law
rule.
and
the
same
reasons
that
this
court
decided
in
ford
are
equally
applicable
here.
the
medicines
don't
cure
mr.
perry.
they
may
mask
his
insanity
for
a
short
period
of
time
so
that
we
may
feel
better
about
executing
mr.
perry,
but
they
don't
cure
mr.
perry.
and
the
insanity
that
underlies
those
medications
is
still
there.
you
would
still
be
sending--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--well,
the
answers
to
that
are
varied.
first
of
all,
under
ford
v.
wainwright,
your
honor,
we
constitutionally
don't
do
so.
and
secondly,
under
louisiana
law,
perhaps
even
more
importantly
if
ford
were
to
disappear,
under
louisiana
law
there's
a
liberty
interest
that
has
been
created
both
by
state
v.
allen
a
number
of
years
ago
and
state
v.
perry
where,
in
the
perry
case
itself,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
that
louisiana
does
not
execute
the
insane.
they
cited
ford
v.
wainwright
further
down
in
the
opinion,
but
that
was
not
the
basis
for
which
they
made
the
decision
that
louisiana
does
not
execute
the
insane.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor,
i
agree
that
we
have
to
pay
due
deference
to
the
findings
of
fact
to
the
trial
court
and
i
cannot
tell
you
that's
not
the
law.
that
is
the
law.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
the
very,
very
beginning.
and
i
had
a
question
from
you
and
i
got
pulled
aside.
i'm
sorry.
in
addition
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument
that
we
have
been
discussing
here,
we
believe
that
it's
unconstitutional
under
the
eighth
that
mr.
perry
be
executed.
we
also
believe
that
it's
fundamentally
wrong
to
do
so.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
absolutely,
your
honor.
we
think
it's
the
harper
interest
of
last
term.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
i
apologize,
but
we
do
believe
it's
the
harper
interest
of
last
term.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
harper
was
not
decided
at
the
time.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
we'll
furnish
it.
we
believe
it's
fundamentally
wrong
under
the
eighth
and
that
the
eighth
prohibits
this
sort
of
use
of
forcible
medication.
we
also
think
that
there's
a
consensus
against
the
use
of
forcible
medication
that
is
created
by
the
states.
no
state
has
authorized
the
use
of
this
medication
for
purposes
of
punishment.
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
no
state
has
authorized
it
is
important.
secondly,
the
amicus
in
this
case,
the
american
medical
association
and
the
american
psychiatric
association,
have
filed
a
brief
saying
that
from
their
perspective
it's
fundamentally
wrong
and
ethically
wrong.
and
i
think
that
that
second
element
of
a
consensus
starts
with
those
two
organizations.
they
are
the
organizations
that
will
have
to
carry
out
this
order
and
they
have
to
know
more
about
this
sort
of
thing
than
any
other
group.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
it
is
outrageous
and
my
position
is
not
as
far
as
the
amicus
position
on
this
point.
the
amicus
claim
that
it
is
unconstitutional
under
all
circumstances.
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
this
case
and
taken
in
brief
is
that
first
we
believe
it
unconstitutional
under
the
eighth.
but
if
it's
not,
then
under
the
fourteenth,
then,
there
is
a
possibility
that
if
this
case
is
handled
under
the
medical
model
and
this
competency
is
some
byproduct,
then
there
may
be...
the
state
may
extract
its
retribution.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
i
may
have
missed
your
hypothet,
your
honor,
but
the
hypothet
that
i
understood
you
to
give
me
was
that
we
not
medicate
him
outside
of
the
realm
of
the
harper
best
interest--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--your
honor,
that
would
make
the
medicine,
then,
effectually
working
towards
the
purposes
of
punishment.
and
this--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--that's
right.
but
the
fact
that
a
person
has
been
condemned
to
punishment
does
not
justify
anything
that
the
state
may
in
its
imagination
might
wish
to
do
to
them.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
and
people
ignore
medical
advice
all
day.
it's
not--
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
--i
think
that's
probably
the
bottom
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
do
i
agree
it's
a
luxury
to
be
able
to
refuse
medication?
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
an
absolute
fundamental
right
that
bottoms
out
in
human
dignity.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
my
answer
remains
the
same.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
keith
b.
nordyre
first
let
me
address
the
maryland
statute
that
counsel
addressed.
the
maryland
statute,
if
one
would
examine
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute,
as
we
have,
would
indicate
that
the
maryland
legislature
was
very
concerned
about
the
ethics
of
doctors.
they
adopted
exactly
the
approach
that
the
ama
would
suggest
in
this
case.
there
is
a
legislative
task
force
history
of
that
statute
that
is
available
and
subsequent
to
ford
v.
wainwright,
that
statute
was
reenacted
and
they
commute
after
one
opportunity
at
a
hearing.
the
statute
does
say
that
a
person
is
not
incompetent
merely
because
of
the
continued
administration
of
psychotropic
medication.
but
what
i
suggest
that
suggests
is
somebody
that
would
otherwise
be
sane
even
without
the
medication.
secondly,
turning
to
the
turner
v.
safley
analysis
that
counsel
suggested,
turner
simply
doesn't
apply.
turner
is
a
method
of
analysis
that
applies
to
a
prison
regulation.
this
is
a
statute
that
we're
talking
about.
and
if
it's
not
a
statute
it's
certainly
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
marshall
asked
about
the
injections.
they
are
in
fact
injections
and
the
haldoldeconate
is
a
large
enough
injection
where
they
have
to
be
broken
down
into
several
shots
each
time
in
order
to
give
them.
the
question
of
whether
it
was
good
for
him
and
it
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
record.
i
still
think
it
doesn't.
and
the
reason
that
i
think
counsel
says
that
it
appears
in
the
record
is
that
the
questions
that
were
posed
were,
can
you
make
him
competent
to
be
executed?
the
questions
that
were
directed
to
the
physicians
on
the
witness
stand
had
to
do
with
competency
to
be
executed
and
not
whether
or
not
any
of
these
medications
were
in
mr.
perry's
best
interest.
we
likewise
have
spoken
to
mr.
perry,
not
the
physicians,
in
the
last
2
weeks.
he
believes
that
the
monthly
shots
he's
getting
are
lethal
injections.
thank
you.
