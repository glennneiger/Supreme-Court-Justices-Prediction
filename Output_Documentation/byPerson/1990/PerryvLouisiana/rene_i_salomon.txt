mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
first
by
making
note
in
response
to
a
few
questions
tendered
to
my
colleague
in
this
case
in
regard
to
justice
white's
question
about
what
does
the
order
in
this
case
say,
it's
very
clear
that
the
order
says,
as
to
be
prescribed
by
the
physicians
of
the
medical
staff
of
the
department
of
public
safety
and
corrections.
simply
put,
those
words
have
to
mean
something,
and
we
suggest
that
the
court
in
this
matter
chose
those
words
to
afford
to
the
physicians
the
opportunity
to
determine
what
is
in
the
medical
interests
of
this
particular
inmate.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
no,
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
pardon
me?
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
the
court.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
the
judge
himself.
judge
emil--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
on
criminal
cases
they
occasionally
do,
but
it
was
not
done
on
this
particular
case.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
certainly.
i
represented
the
state
not
only
at
the
trial
in
this
matter,
but
in
the
hearing
on
competency
of
this
matter
also.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
the
court
did
specifically
find,
by
asking
questions
of
the
individual
doctors,
whether
this
medication
was
good
for
him.
the
doctors,
including
cox,
jimenez,
and
vincent
collectively
said,
this
medication
is
in
his
medical
interest
because
it
is
one,
rational.
two,
it
is
appropriate.
and
three,
it
is
beneficial.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
i
think
that
it
would
be
found
in
the
court's
order
itself
where
the
judge
recognizes
that
mr.
perry
has
an
interest
in
refusing
the
medication.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
it
would
be
the
language
on
the
second-to-last
page
of
the
court's
order
where
the
court
recognized--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--the
order
of
october
21st,
1988,
where
the
court
basically
found
an
interest
of
the
inmate,
an
interest
of
the
state,
and
the
inmate's
interest
was
overridden.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
i
don't
think
there
was
a
finding
that
he
will
be
a
danger
without
the
medication.
but
the
state's
position
in
this
case
is
when
you
examine
this
title
xv,
section
830.1,
the
state
need
not
prove
that
he
is
dangerous
to
himself
in
order
to
justify
medication
in
this
particular
example.
what
we
respond
to
my
colleague's
argument
here
is
that
830.1
is
not
the
particular
statute
that
governs
this
particular
case,
as
was
in
the
case
of,
i
believe,
kentucky
v.
thompson
in
dealing
with
visitation
privileges.
we
have
a
scenario
where
a
state
statute
specifically
says,
you
can
do
medication
where
the
inmate
is
dangerous,
and
that
is
a
sufficient
condition
on
which
the
state
may
choose
to
exercise
its
ability
to
medicate.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
well,
i
believe
that
it
does
comply
with
harper
and
in
the
state's
view,
harper
indicates
the
appropriate
result
in
this
case.
if,
for
example
in
harper,
mental
illness
can
justify
involuntary
medical
treatment
in
order
to
prevent
dangerousness
to
the
individual,
to
others,
or
to
even
their
property,
then
certainly
the
state's
interest
in
this
case
is
at
least
that
great
if
not
greater.
that
is--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
there
is
not--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--that's
correct.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
absolutely.
that
is
correct
what
the
judge
said.
and
what
we
are
saying,
justice
o'connor,
is
basically
that
harper,
once
again,
if
you
can
medicate
a
person
who's
mentally
ill
to
protect
property,
you
certainly
should
be
able
to
do
it
to
enforce
the
court's
interest
in
its
laws
and
in
obtaining
its
punishment.
to
respond
to
a
point
made
by
mr.
nordyke
also,
we
believe
that
in
this
particular
case
there
is
less
of
an
interest
on
behalf
of
the
inmate
for
the
simple
reason
in
harper
there
was
an
individual
who
one
day
was
going
to
get
out
of
jail,
who
had
a
long-term
interest
of
the
effects
that
might
result
from
the
administration
of
the
medication.
in
this
particular
case,
because
this
man
is
sentenced
to
death,
his
opportunity
to
live
the
number
of
years
in
which
he
will
be
alive
are
limited,
not
as
if
the
matter
in
harper,
where
we
have
an
infinite
number
of
years
where
the
individual
may
stay
alive.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
it
did
not.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
was
clear
to
be
very
frank
that
it
did
or
it
did
not
apply.
the
court
was
somewhat
in
a
vague
area
whether
or
not
this
statute,
830.1,
applied
in
this
particular
case.
as
mr.
nordyke
said,
at
one
juncture
he
used
a
part
of
830.1
to
stay
the
medication.
at
another
juncture
he
said,
no,
my
interests
are
different
and
conducted
a
somewhat
different
analysis.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
i
would
say
there
are
two
purposes.
one
is
that
as
you
state,
basically,
so
that
the
state
can
satisfy
its
interest,
and,
number
two,
because
the
state
has
a
duty
to
provide
treatment
to
a
person
that
needs
treatment.
and
in
this
particular
case,
if
this
man
is
truly
incompetent,
then
he's
not
in
a
position
to
know
to
refuse
medicine
and
make
that
decision
competently.
and
for
the
state
to
deny
him
that
treatment--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--i
would
say,
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
it
is
basically
to
execute
him,
in
this
case
because
the
state
has
an
interest.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
that's
correct.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
that
is
in
dispute.
it
depends
on
where
you
can
draw
the
line
as
to
he
has
a
blood
serum
level
that
allows
him
the
opportunity
to
make
such
a
decision.
some
of
the
doctors
have
said
that
it
will
take
3
months
of
consistent
treatment,
that
is,
one
injection
every
4
weeks,
for
him
to
reach
a
plateau
where
he
would
be
able
to
act
as
if
he
were
not
hallucinating
or
having
delusions
or
showing
symptoms
of
psychosis.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
perhaps
i'm
misunderstanding.
would
you
repeat
it?
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
i
think
in
some
circumstances
that's
correct.
the
judge
did
find
that
he's
competent
to
be
executed
when
maintained
on
the
regimen
of
medication,
and
so
that
would
lead
to
your
result--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--i'm
not
certain
of
that.
i
don't
think
the
record
exactly
states
through
any
doctor
or
any
medical
record
that
he
was
competent
as
a
determination
at
the
moment
that
he
decided
that
he
didn't
want--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--well,
i
agree
with
you
in
basic--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--i
think
you're
correct,
justice
white.
i'm
not
trying
to
quibble
with
you,
justice
stevens.
but
it's
just
you're
asking
specifically
about
the
record
and
it
doesn't
so
clearly
demonstrate
as
you're
asking
me
for,
but
i'm
willing
to
state
for
you
that
definitely
that
he's
got...
he
might
have
a
lucid
moment
where
he
can
decide
that
he
does
not
want
the
medication.
and
i
think
in
this
case
the
judge
recognized
that
fact
and
then
conducted
this
sort
of
weighing
and
balancing--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--i
believe
that
he
does.
and
our
brief
acknowledges
such
and
makes
two
arguments
to
that
effect.
and
in
this
particular
case,
we
feel
that
an
examination
of
the
facts
and
the
law
according
to
turner
v.
safley,
as
was
applied
in
washington
v.
harper,
is
appropriate.
and
if
you
do
this
testing
a
standard
of
reasonableness,
that
is,
whether
the
court's
order
is
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest,
the
state
of
louisiana
submits
that
this
court
order
is
appropriate
in
this
case,
because
it
is
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
there
was
also--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--well,
basically
for
the
same
reason
that
the
statute
in
kentucky
v.
thompson
didn't
mandate
that
visitation
privileges
were
some
protected
liberty
interest.
my
point
is
that
830.1
does
not
apply
to
a
scenario
where
the
state
of
louisiana
seeks
to
involuntarily
medicate
an
inmate
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
competency
to
carry
out
its
punishment.
now,
it
says--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--dangerousness.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
well,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
that--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--and
i
think
that
is
correct
to
the
extent
that
830.1
is
a
statutory
expression
of
what
the
state
can
do
and
that
is
a
sufficient
basis
on
which
the
state
may
involuntarily
treat.
but
it
is
not
the
sole
or
only
basis
is
what
the
state
now
contends.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
that's
my
submission,
your
honor.
now
there
were
some
other
statements
to
the
effect
that
treatment
in
this
case
is
not
in
his
medical
interest,
and
i
have
already
suggested
and
would
further
state
that
it
is
an
appropriate,
beneficial,
rational
course
of
action.
three
doctors
have
stated
such
in
the
record
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
both.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
perry--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--well,
because
i
think--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--right,
but
i
think
the
state
of
louisiana
is
limited
by
the
eighth
amendment
and
other
provisions
that
we
can't
do
things
that
are
cruel
or
unusual
or
excessive
in
nature.
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
meet
some
minimal
due
process
guidelines
here
procedurally
in
what
we
can
and
cannot
do.
now
this
particular
inmate
has
previously
to
go
to
trial
been
treated.
and
he
has
been
medicated
at
the
forensic
facility
in
order
to
establish
competency
for
trial.
louisiana,
like
several
other
states,
does
allow
for
the
treatment
of
incompetent
defendants
in
order
to
establish
competency
for
trial.
we
submit
that
if
louisiana
can
establish
competency
for
a
defendant
to
go
to
trial
when
that
individual's
presumption
of
innocence
and
other
rights
are
at
its
zenith,
then
the
state
of
louisiana
should
be
allowed
to
establish
competency
in
order
to
carry
out
its
sentence
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
i
have
no
cases,
but
i
think
appendix
j,
which
sets
forth
the
statutes
of
20-some-odd
states,
does
indicate
that
at
least
in
louisiana
you
don't
need
the
element
of
dangerousness
in
order
to
treat
someone
to
establish
competency
to
go
trial.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
i'm
not
able
to
answer
your
question,
because
i
have
not
researched
the
federal
aspect
of
what
a
federal
court
could
order
an
incompetent
defendant
to
undergo.
but
i
would
pleased
to
submit
something,
if
that
would
be
your
desire.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
i
don't
think
harper
said
that
it
is
applicable
in
the
pretrial
situation.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
well,
i
think
that
it
may
be,
to
be
very
candid,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
don't
think
that
you
always
have
to
establish
dangerousness
in
order
to
justify
the
involuntary
or
some
other
administration
of
medication
in
order
to
establish
competency.
i
think
the
statutes
that
are
set
forth
in
appendix
j
reveal
that
some
states
do
require
dangerousness
in
order
to
justify
the
involuntary
administration.
and
there
are
some
states
that
do
not.
and
louisiana
is
one
of
a
handful
that
do.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
well,
i
think
as
it
stands
in
louisiana
you
can
make
that
argument.
and
whether
there
is
dangerousness
or
not,
you
can.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
and
that
is
not
the
case
here,
but
i'm
citing
it
as
a
premise
of
sorts
to
say
that
we
have
done
it
in
this
particular
case,
and
because
we
have
done
it...
that
is,
an
involuntary
administration
of
medication
to
establish
competency
to
go
to
trial...
we
can
do
it
for
competency
to
exact
our
sentence.
that
is
a
validly
obtained
matter.
the
trial
court
in
this
matter
in
basic
terms
identified--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--absolutely,
i
mean
because
the
punishment...
the
whether
determination
has
already
been
made
what
his
sentence
will
be.
many
of
his
rights
are
greatly
diminished,
his
freedom
from
confinement.
we
know
that
his
freedom
from
bodily
restraint
to
be
physically
strapped
into
that
electric
chair
is
reduced
as
well
as
his
ability
to
determine
his
fate.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
that's
exactly
right.
many
of
his
rights,
as
i
have
said,
have
been
limited,
and
that
includes,
for
example,
his
right
to
life
and
his
right
to
self-determination
of
sorts.
to
honor
mr.
perry's
request
in
this
case,
that
is
his
refusal
of
medication
and
beneficial
medical
treatment,
i
might
add,
would
be
to
be
contrary
to
several
valid
interests.
first,
i
think
that
it's
correct
to
say
that
the
inmate's
right
to
some
sort
of
self-determination
has
been
greatly
diminished
by
the
fact
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
capital
murder
and
that
he
has
been
sentenced
to
death.
and
i
think
also
that
once
that
right
of
the
state
to
impose
punishment
is
established,
that
we
recognize
in
some
sort
of
inferential
way
that
the
state
is
the
entity
that
chooses
what
a
punishment
shall
be.
and
if
we
in
this
case
honor
mr.
perry's
right
to
refuse
medical
treatment
as
indicated
in
the
record,
then
i
think
we
give,
in
a
way,
to
perry
the
opportunity
to
choose
his
punishment.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
fine.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
right.
but
i
still
think
that
that
interest
would
not
be,
then,
legitimate,
possibly
under
a
turner
v.
safley
analysis,
or
potentially
it
could
walk
into
the
prohibition
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
well,
but
there
are
medical
benefits.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
i
understand
that.
but
there
are
other
rights
that
he
has.
for
instance,
this
freedom
from
confinement
and
these
other
steps
like
medicating
him
to
establish
the
competency
to
go
to
trial,
which
are
basically
steps
on
the
road
to
execution
which
are
not
beneficial
to
him--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--correct.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
that's
true,
but
i
still
say
that
even
though
the
state
might
have
an
interest
in
seeing
its
penalty
satisfied,
that
a
turner
v.
safley
analysis
says
that
you
have
to
have
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest.
and
possibly
in
your
hypothetical,
the
state's
interest
would
be
reduced
if
there
is
not
beneficial
medication.
because
there's
a
benefit
to
the
individual.
there
is
an
interest
of
the
state
to
carry
out
its
punishment
bottom
line.
but
it's
limited.
and
it's
limited
by
things
like
what's
legitimate
and
what's
going
to
be
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
correct.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
that
is
correct.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
well,
the
state's
primary
interest
is
just
that.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
well,
the
state
would
still
be
interested
to
the
extent
of
providing
beneficial
medical
treatment
to
a
person
that's
ill.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
well,
i
think
that
the
state
could
insist
on
it
if
you--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--well,
you
asked
me
to
predict,
and
i
think
that
they
may.
and
the
reason--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--that's
correct.
now,
beyond
the
trial
court's
analysis
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
--october
21,
'88.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
beyond
the
trial
court's
analysis
in
this
particular
case,
the
trial
court
did
not
conduct
any
national
consensus
search,
but
we
submit
to
this
court
today
that
there
is
no
state
legislation
that
exists
anywhere
prohibiting
involuntary
medication
for
a
competency
to
execute.
in
fact
we
suggest
that
one
state,
the
state
of
maryland,
does
specifically
allow
competency
to
be
based
on
the
involuntary
administration
of
medication.
in
fact,
of
37
states
which
have
the
death
penalty,
24
of
those
states
contemplate
in
one
fashion
or
another
that
treatment
can
occur.
and
it's
basically
premised
upon
a
finding
that
executions
cannot
be
carried
out
until
competency
is
established,
restored,
or
regained.
if
on
the
one
hand,
we
know
that
we
can't
or
cannot
execute
those
who
are
incompetent
and
on
the
other
hand,
we
can,
if
they
are
restored
to
sanity,
the
state
suggests
something
happens
between
those
two
points.
and
the
something
that
happens
is
these
24
states
basically
permit
the
administration
of
medication
to
establish
competency
for
execution.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
no,
i
do
not.
my
colleague
in
this
case
has
spent
some
time
in
his
brief
talking
in
terms
of
procedural
due
process
was
violated
in
this
matter
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
again
that
the
court,
the
trial
court,
utilized
far
beyond
the
procedures
required
in
ford
v.
wainwright
to
determine
the
interests
of
mr.
perry,
the
interests
of
the
state,
and
whether
the
state's
interests
would
supersede.
in
ford,
the
court
was
basically
required
to
afford
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
a
neutral
decision
maker,
and
those
things
were
in
fact
provided
to
mr.
perry,
in
addition
to
many
other
matters.
if
the
court
would
have
any
further
questions
on
any
of
these
matters,
i'd
be
pleased
to
answer
them.
mr.
rene'
i.
salomon
difficult
question.
i
checked
as
recently
as
yesterday
and
it
depends
how
you
define
what
is
forcible
medication.
the
scenario
that
has
occurred
as
of
june
the
20th
or
so
of
1990
was
that
the
doctors
determined
that
mr.
perry
was
in
some
kind
of
episode
where
he
was
dangerous
and
they
said
to
him,
we
want
to
give
you
medicine.
are
you
willing
to
take
it?
and
if
you're
not
willing
to
take
it,
we're
going
to
make
you
take
it
and
basically
he
said,
yes,
i'll
take
it.
and
he
has
taken
the
medicine
in
june,
august,
and
september,
and
as
recently
as
a
week
ago,
one
of
the
supervising
physicians
did
in
fact
enter
another
standing
order
for
3
months'
worth
of
treatment,
which
would
be
one
injection
every
4
weeks
of
approximately
200
milligrams
of
the
medication
known
as
haldoldeconate,
which
is
a
long-acting
and
lasting
medication.
