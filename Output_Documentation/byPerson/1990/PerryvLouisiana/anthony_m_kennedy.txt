justice
kennedy
your
position
being
that
medication
is
not
permitted
under
the
statute
because
he's
not
a
danger
to
himself
or
others?
justice
kennedy
and
you
took
this
position
consistently
throughout
all
the
proceedings
to
this
court?
justice
kennedy
isn't
it
a
fair...
isn't
it
a
fair
inference
from
the
record
that
the
only
reason
the
medication
was
turned
down
was
so
that
he
could
not
be
well
enough
to
be
executed?
justice
kennedy
in
fact,
isn't
that
the
reason
that
counsel
ordered
him
not
to
take
the
medication?
justice
kennedy
well,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
medication
is
against
his
medical
best
interest,
is
there?
justice
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
his
condition
prior
to
his
execution.
