mr.
a.
camden
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
disagree
that
this
case
has
anything
to
do
with
lobbying,
that
this
case
is
a
case
where
there
is
far
more
than
just
the,
as
the
court
has
said
in
many
cases,
merely
the
solicitation
or
the
asking
of
an
ordinance
to
be
passed.
judge
macmahon
in
the
very
first
order
in
this
case
said
that
the
ordinances
were
but
two
of
the
overt
acts
of
a
conspiracy.
and
when
we
get
into
the
facts
of
the
case
and
you
see
all
of
the
things
that
were
done...
you
see,
for
example,
on
the
part
of
coa,
there
was
a
lot
of
nonordinance
activity.
they
gave
away
space
so
omni
could
not
compete.
they
made
disparaging
remarks
about
omni.
they
interfered
with
omni's
receipt
of
goods.
they
got
secret
information
from
the
city
and
used
it
against
omni.
they
procured
frivolous
litigation.
they
stole
or
double-billed
so
as
to
give
them
an
advantage
and
contrary
to
mr.
klein,
you'll
find
in
footnote
4
of
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
that
there
is
indeed
the
exchange
of
billboards
for
favors
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
this
is
for
noerr.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
you...
i
would
go
back
to
parker.
i
was
taking
them
in
reverse
order--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--because
that's
just
the
way
my
notes
ran.
so
when
we
and
i
apologize...
when
we
look
at
the...
noerr,
when
we
look
at
whether
or
not
there
is
an
exception
to
noerr,
the
sham
exception,
we
don't
just
have
lobbying.
we
have
conduct.
we
have
conduct
that,
and
i
think
it's
clear
in
this
case
and
i
think
it's
important,
that
the
conduct
of
coa
was
directed
to
closing
the
legislative,
administrative
or
judicial
process.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
okay,
what
am
i...
i'm
saying
is
the
sham
is
the
efforts
and
the...
really
if
you
want
to
get
down
to
it,
it's
the
prior
agreement,
the
1980
agreement.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
no,
sir--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--on,
on
one
they
succeeded
in
the
city
council
on
one
of
the
two
ordinances.
they
procured
and
went
forward
with
frivolous
litigation.
there
was
an
unconstitutional
finding
of
an
ordinance
which
they
required
it
go
forward
with
it.
they,
and
i
do
say
they
had
what
i...
they
gave
favors
for
billboards.
they
had--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--because
as
i
read
the
sham
exception,
the
sham
exception
comes
to
play
when
the
conduct
that
the
individuals
use
is
directed
toward
the
foreclosure
of
the
citizen
from
meaningful
access
to
the
legislative
decision
making
process.
that's
what
the
fourth
circuit
found;
that
they
had
denied
our
access,
that
the
conspiracy
between
the
two
of
them
had
denied
our
access
so
we
had
no
right,
we
had
no
ability
to
go
to
the
legislative
process
and
therefore,
that
the
whole
process,
that
the
whole
process
was
a
sham.
and
it's
biased
the
process.
you've
used
a
lot
of
words.
they
usurped
the
decision
making
process.
they
shut
down
the
machinery
of
the
process.
they
closed
the
process.
all
they
did...
they
did
that.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
some
of
them
and
they--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--okay,
biased
the
process
comes
from
allied
tube.
usurps
the
process,
i
believe,
comes
from
motor
transport.
shuts
down
the
machinery
was
justice
douglas,
and
i'm
sorry
i
don't
remember
that
particular
case.
so
those
all
come
down...
the
fourth
circuit
particularly
said
in
their
case
that
when
it
forecloses
a
citizen
from
meaningful
access
to
the
legitimate
decision
making
process,
they
said
once
that
happens
it's
a
sham.
and
that's
what
we
have.
once
that
you
take
the
process
away,
what,
what...
and
i
believe
you'll
find
when
you
look
at
the
amicus
briefs...
you'll
find
that
the
whole
concept
of
noerr
they
say
is
that
the
representation,
the
concept
of
representation
depends
upon
the
ability
of
the
people
to
make
their
wishes
known
to
their
representatives.
that
ability
was
gone.
from
the...
there
was
a
longstanding
agreement
from
1980
before
we
ever
came
that
we
proved
that
the
city
and
coa
entered
into
such
that
in
return
for
the
favors--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--we
were
able--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--we
were
able
to
go
there--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--no,
sir.
we
were
not
able
to
make
our
views
known.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
the
record
shows
that
we
went
to
meetings
that
were
closed,
that
were
predetermined,
that
there
was
no
ability
for
us
to
participate.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
closed
in
the
fact
that
they...
we
went
there
and
if
you'll
read
the
record,
they
said
when
we
got
there
we
were
told
what
it
would
be.
we
had
no
input
into
it.
we
were
told
what
it
would
be.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
if
you
have...
if
everybody
sits
there
and
they
have
their
ears
covered
up
and
they
turn
their
back
to
you
and
they
say
that
you
have
the
ability
to
talk,
you
might
as
well
be
talking
to
the
wall.
i
think
that's
not
what
we
had
the
ability--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--no,
sir.
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so,
because
in
a
legislative
committee
hearing
and
i
think
it's
important.
in
this
case
we
had
an
agreement,
a
1980
agreement
between
the
city
and
coa,
based
upon
the
exchange
of
favors
which
said,
we
will
never
again
allow
anybody
in
here
and
any
time
you
need
us,
mr.
coa,
we'll
use
our
power
to
keep
them
out.
we'll
close
the
administrative
process.
we'll
close
the
legislative
process
to
them
and
we'll
do
what
you
say.
they
sold
their
office
out.
and
i
think
that's
important
and
once
you
do
that
there
is
a
sham.
noerr-pennington
doesn't
protect
that.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
no,
sir,
we
never
got
a
chance
to
maneuver.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
there
were--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
all
right,
in
the
record
you
will
find
and
contrary
to
mr.
klein,
there
were
free
billboard
space
or
discounted
billboard
space
given
to
the
councilmen
which
they
did
not...
and
you
can
look
at
it...
they
did
not
report
as
campaign
contributions.
they
were
given
special
locations--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--that
would
vary
according
to
the
particular
councilman,
but
it
would
go
anywhere
from
$300
up
to
$1,000.
i
don't
know
the
exact
amount.
you'd
have
to
take
your
chart
and
you'd
run
it.
there
was
exchanges.
they
didn't
report
it.
they
got
free
and--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--well,
there
was
different
people
had
different
amounts
of
free
advertising
space.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
maybe
$1,500
altogether.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
we're
talking
about...
well,
we're
talking
about--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--no,
sir,
we're
talking
about
more
than
that.
we're
also
talking
about
the
fact
that
in
the
exchange
they
had
the
power
of
this
monopoly
billboard
that
made
sure
they
get
back
into
office.
there's
no
other
billboard
industry.
sir?
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
they
got
the...
they
got
the
monopoly's
power.
they
got
the
use
of
the
monopoly
power
in
exchange
for
keeping
the
monopoly
a
monopoly.
yes,
sir,
that's
absolutely
true
in
this
record.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
all
right.
the
parker
case.
if
we--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--if
we
go
back
over
to
parker,
you're
coming
in
now
and
i
do
not
agree
that
the
hallie,
whether
or
not
this
is
a
state
action
or
not
state
action
is
closed,
because
to
get
to
parker
by
its
very
nature
you
have
to
first
determine,
and
we
have
in
our
footnote
raised
that
question
that's
been
fully
briefed
in
the
court
below,
and
we
do
not
believe
for
one
instance
that
the
zoning
laws
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
allow
for
this
economic--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--we
did
not
cross-petition
for
certiorari
because
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
they
raised
the
question
of
parker
and
to
get
to
the
parker
particular
question
you
must
necessarily
raise
the
question
of
whether
parker
on
its
very
foundation
has
met
that
requirement
that
it's
state
action.
so
no,
we
did
not.
we
put
it
in
our
footnote.
one
of
the
things
i
think
is
important,
too,
is
as
you
look
at
this
case
and
as
we
look
at
a
jury
verdict...
we
have
a
jury
verdict.
we
have
a
jury
verdict
based
on
a
sham
exception.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes.
and
we
have
a
jury
verdict
based
upon
the
coconspirator
exception
to
parker.
so
what
we--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
sir,
and
the
whole
question...
i'm...
that's
what...
on
parker
the
whole
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
coconspirator
exception
to
parker.
now,
mr.
judge
macmahon
said,
and
it
has
been
our
position
all
along,
that
parker
does
not
come
into
play,
because
in
this
instance
you
do
not
show
or
do
not
have
a
clearly
articulated
state
purpose
that
would
allow
people
to
conspire.
and
once
you
bring
in
conspiracy
and
you
show
a
conspiracy,
parker
does
not
apply.
in
your
case
of
parker,
of
course,
and
all
these
cases
flow
from
that
when
it
was
said
in
parker,
it
said
that
you
did
not
have
here
before
you
that
the,
that
the
city
was
a
coconspirator
or
was
in
conspiracy
with
the
people.
and
that's
what
starts
all
of
this.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
it's
a
conspiracy
with,
with
the
public
officials
to...
in
that,
in
this
case...
was
to
eliminate
any
access
or
competition
with
a
preference--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--i
think
that
if
that
is
what
happened
which
is
not
our
case
that
you
may
have...
there
are
ways
to
go
about
passing
ordinances
that
are,
that
are
legal.
i'm
not
about
to
say
that.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
simply
agreeing,
that's,
that's,
that's
what
we
call
the
persuasion.
you
agree
to
the
persuasion
of
one
over
the
persuasion
of
another.
that's,
that's,
we
have
no
qualms
of
that.
we
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir,
i
certainly
can
draw
the
line.
and
i
draw
the
line
in
this
case
is
when
they
come
together
and
they
make
that
agreement
prior
to
any...
they've
had
that
agreement,
that
1980
agreement
and
i
still
think
that's
very
important.
that's
before
anybody
was
here
and
it
was
when
there
was
another
billboard
company
was
coming
into
town.
the
coa,
mr.
cantey,
went
to
the
city
officials
and
he
got
a
promise
from
them
that
anytime
he
needed
their
protection,
they'd
give
it
to
him
and
in
return
he
would
make
sure
that
they
had
billboard
space,
that
they
would
have
discounted
billboard
space.
that's
in
the
record.
so
you
have
this
agreement
and
that
agreement
was
put
into
effect
in
this
case
as
soon
as
omni
came
to
town.
it
was
put
into
effect--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
sir.
they
talked
about
it.
if
you'll
read
their
opinion,
they
talk
about
that
agreement.
they
even
quote
the
letter
that
set
up
that
agreement
in
1980.
they
talk
about
that
and
they
show
that
agreement
and
they
show
how
it
went
forward.
the
court
of...
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
very
good.
it's
a
thorough
opinion.
it
talks
about
the
facts.
it
talks
about
in
footnote
4
the
fact
that
it
was
trading,
trading
billboards
for
favors.
we
even
had
the
fact
that
they
would,
coa,
would
go
out
and
paste
over
billboards,
validly
sold
billboards--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--i'm
relying
on
page
13a
of
the
petition
for
cert
and
he
talks
about
in
december
1980,
he
wrote
mr.
naeggele
another
outdoor
advertising...
and
that's
the
agreement
we're
talking
about.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
at
the
next,
at
the
next,
the
quote
right
on
that
same
page,
that
the,
the,
cantey
had
testified
that
he
sought
these
assurances
from
the
mayor
regarding
the
desired
ordinance
in
order
to
keep
naeggele
out
of
columbia.
assurances...
that
to
me
that's
an
agreement
right
there
on
page
13a.
that's
what
they
say
and
that's
the
discussion
of
that
very
letter
that
i'm
talking
about
and
that
is
where
i'm
referring
to.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
and
of
course
it
was
in
our
opinion
a
prior
agreement
for
private
benefit.
now--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--just
the
pure
agreement?
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
we
don't...
and
i
guess
i'm
not
being
clear...
i,
i
do
not
think
that
favoring
one
over
the
other
in
what
we
call
the,
the...
a
legitimate
legislative
process,
having
that
process
and
you
going
into
it
and
winning
over
the
congressman
by
your
persuasion,
by
merely
persuading
him,
that's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
we
don't
have
that.
we
have,
first
of
all,
we
have
an
arena
that
we
can't
even
get
into
and
a,
and
a
congressman
that
has
in
effect
been
bought.
so
no,
we
don't
even
have
that
particular
instance.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
no,
sir.
what
i'm
saying
is
in
our
case
we
don't
have
the...
he
can
refuse
to
talk
to
them,
but
the
refusal
to
talk
to
them
is
his
choice,
is
his...
he
is
the
congressman
and
there...
he
has
put
his...
the
agenda
out
there
as
to
cars
and
he's
done
that
and
you
get
to
talk
to
him.
the
japanese
try
to
talk
to
him
and
he
can
refuse
to
but
they
have
the
opportunity
to
try
to
talk
to
him.
he
hasn't
sold
his
office
out.
he
hasn't
said
to
the
general
motors,
because
you
give
me
free
cars,
i
am
never
going
to
talk
to
the
japanese
and
i
promise
you
because
of
those
cars
and
you
keeping
me
in
office
and
using
your
power,
general
motors,
i'm
going
to
make
sure
that
i
do
everything
you
want
me
to.
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i'm
complaining
that
the
city
is
the...
is
in
the
conspiracy
through
the--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--that's
correct,
through
their...
they
can
only
act
through
their
actors.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
that's
correct.
i,
i
can't
talk
to
the
city
except
through
their
actors
and
they...
and
their
actors...
for
example,
if
you
look
and
see
what
the
city
did
to
us,
that's
pretty
important
i
think.
if
you
look
what
the
city
did,
they
did
far
more
than
just
passing
an
ordinance.
they...
mr.
finlay...
he
berated
omni
on
the
radio
and
at
meetings.
you'll
read
the
testimony
and
they
said
that
you
couldn't
get
a
word
in
edgewise,
that
coa
sign
locations...
they
gave
them
special
treatment
sign
locations.
they
let
them
have
historic
zone
sign
locations.
they
gave
them
secret
information
that
allowed
them
to
get
sign
locations.
i
don't
know
if
you
know
about
the
moratorium.
it
was,
it
was
a
secret
moratorium
that
was
written
on
the
back
of
a
napkin
on
march
10th
and
it
was
passed
by
the
city.
it
was
a
moratorium,
and
then
on
march
the
9th,
the
day
before,
the
coa
went
out
and
got
sign
locations
in
the
very
area
that
this
moratorium
covered.
2
weeks
later
the
moratorium
mysteriously
changed...
no
one
takes
any
credit
for
it...
to
become
a
larger
moratorium,
be
city-wide.
on
the
day
before
that
or
2
days
before
that,
the
coa
is
out
getting
more
sign
locations
in
this
area
that
is
to
become
a
moratorium.
so
they
had
secret
information.
they
harassed...
even
after
judge
cureton
issued
his
order
saying
that
the
zoning
or
that
the
moratorium
was
unconstitutional
and
in
that
order
he
said,
you...
they
will...
you're
enjoined
from
not...
from
keeping
them
from
building
their
signs
whatsoever.
they
get
to
build
their
signs
no,
no
matter
what.
they
went
out
and
they
harassed
them,
omni,
us.
they
arrested
omni,
us.
they
threatened
omni,
us,
even
in
the
face
of
that
order
of
judge
cureton.
they
then
went
ahead
and--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
we
certainly...
free
or
discounted
billboard
space
and
the
use
of
the
power
of
the
coa.
yes,
sir,
we
surely
did.
now...
and
also
you'll
find
in
the
record
that
the
city
was
advised
by
their
lawyers
that,
that
this
was
an
unconstitutional
ordinance.
they
passed
it
anyway.
they
were
advised
that
they
should
not...
we
then
filed
suit
against
them.
they
were
advised
that
you'll
lose
your
suit
and
they
said...
it's
in
the
record...
continue
that
litigation,
cause
we
need
the
delay.
we
need
to
keep
the
delay
so
omni
can't
come
in
here.
now
that's
what
we
have
in
the
record.
you
can...
you
start
with
that
first
agreement
and
you
go
forward
and
you
look
at
all
the
action
as
judge
macmahon
clearly
said,
the
ordinances
are
but
two
of
the
overt
acts
of
this
conspiracy.
if
you
look
at
the
fourth
circuit,
and
they
went
into
a
big
discussion
about
the
evidence
and
i'd
like
you
to
look
at
it,
because
it's
very
good.
and
you
have
the
question
here
and
they
say,
well,
we're
going
to
somehow
chill
the
right
to
petition.
we're
going
to
make
people
scared
to
petition.
well,
i
think
the
way
that
i
look
at
this
case
that
to
do
anything
other
than
affirm
this
case
chills
the
right
to
petition.
because
what
this
case
does,
if
you
do
anything
but
affirm
it
seems
to
me
is
you
put
the
stamp
of
approval
on
a
factual
scenario
that
eliminates,
that
eliminates
the
process
and
closes
it
and
turns
it
over
to
private
individuals.
now
that's
what
we
have
seen
in
the
cases
that
we've
tried
not
to
do.
we
try
to
keep
the
process
open
and
if
we
lose
on
a
playing
field,
we
lose,
but
we've
got
to
get
onto
it.
and
when
you
close
that
playing
field,
when
you
say
that
you
can
trade
your
power,
trade
your
billboards,
trade
that
to
keep
your
monopoly
and
to
keep
them
in
power,
then
there
is
no
process.
it's
not
unlike
many
of
the
cases
that
you
already
talked
about;
allied
tube,
motor
transport,
and
those
type
cases.
in
closing,
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points.
and
one
of
them
everybody
seems...
well,
mr.
klein
doesn't
but
when
you
read
the
writings
and
the
cases...
everybody
seems
to
say
that
bribery
should
not
be
allowed.
it's
a
bad
word.
bribery...
we
should
not
allow
it.
that
should
and...
subject
the
bribery
people
to
antitrust
liability.
okay,
did
you
ever...
if
you
go
behind
bribery,
look
and
see
what
it
is.
you
have
giving
of
money
for
favors.
okay.
what,
what,
what
it
has
to
do
with
that
bribery.
it
isn't
that
the
guy
gets
rich
off
of
the
money
that's
so
offensive.
it's
the
fact
that
he
has
eliminated
and
sold
his
office.
he
has
in
effect...
what
we
have
here...
he
has
closed
the
process.
so
what
bribery
is
and
when
you
break
it
down,
it's
nothing
more
than
paying
money
to
close
the
process
and
i
don't
think
anybody...
at
least
from
the
writings
that
i've
seen...
wants
to
say
that
the
antitrust,
noerr-pennington,
or
the
parker
should
be
okay
even
in
the
face
of
bribery.
and
if
we
look
at
that,
if
we
look
at
the
affiliated
capital
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
where
it
was
en
banc
with
a
lot
of
judges,
you
see
a
thorough
discussion
of
this,
these
principles.
you
see
one
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
it
comes
down
to,
i
think
in
this
case,
they're
asking
you
to
draw
these
lines.
and
i'd
point
to
one
last
point.
and
that
is
if
you
look
at
the
charges
requested
by
the
coa
as
to
what
you,
the
jury
must
find,
to
make
us
liable,
this
is
what
it
says.
it's
on
172
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
says,
this
protection
of
the
citizen
fails,
however,
when
one
or
more
of
the
public
officials
joins
in
an
illegal
agreement
or
a
conspiracy
with
the
person
seeking
the
political
action.
that
is
what
they
ask
and
said
that
their
protection
failed
when
that
happened.
that
request
for
charge
was
theirs.
that
very
statement
or
words
to
that
effect
was
charged
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
came
back
in
an
affirmative,
yes,
they
conspired.
and
you
say
under
what
criteria
could
they
find
a
conspiracy?
it's
very
important,
i
think,
for
the
court
to
look
at
judge
perry's
instruction
on
conspiracy,
because
we
had
to
overcome
the
strictest
of
burdens
and
this
is
on...
found
on
page
76
of
the
joint
appendix
and
it
says,
that
we
the
plaintiff
must
not
just
prove
a
factual
scenario
that
supports
a
conspiracy.
we
must
prove
a
factual
scenario
that
doesn't
allow
or
doesn't...
can't
be
understood
to
also
be
innocent
or
nonconspiratorial.
now
that's
a
heavy
burden.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
that's
correct.
now
there
is
a
separation
in
the
case
law
of
that,
but
the
unobjected
to
charge
on
the
sham
exception
is
found
at
page
81
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
this
is
what
it
says
and
this
was
unobjected
to.
no
one
took
issue
with
it.
if
you
find
the
defendants
conspired
together
with
the
intent
to
foreclose
the
plaintiff
from
meaningful
access
to
a
legitimate
decision
making
process
with
regard
to
the
ordinance
in
question,
then
your
verdict
would
be
for
the
plaintiff
on
that
issue.
so,
when
they--
