justice
scalia
--mr.
klein,
what
you
said
about
bribery
suggested
to
me
a
question
similar
to
justice
stevens'.
i
don't
know
what
the
law
is
but
suppose
you
have,
suppose
you
have
a
state
that
says
that
a,
a
bribed
official
act
is
invalid?
suppose
that's
the
law
of
a
particular
state,
therefore
it's
not
state
action.
justice
scalia
it's
invalid.
it's
not
state
action.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
then?
justice
scalia
well,
it
doesn't,
it
doesn't
determine
what
state
action
for
those
constitutional
purposes,
but
it
might
well
determine
what
states...
what
is
state
action
for
purposes
of
parker.
justice
scalia
--you
mean
a
conspiracy
with
the
public
officials
to
do
something
that's
not
in
the
public
interest
i...
that
they
don't
really
believe
is
in
the
public
interest?
justice
scalia
what
if,
what
if
the
public
officials
have
the,
the
famous
attitude
what's
good
for
general
motors
is
good
for
the
country?
what
if,
what
if
they
really
think
this
local
company
employs
a
lot
of
local
people?
it's
local
money,
local
investment?
suppose
they
think
it's,
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
whole
city
that
the
billboard
trade
should
be
monopolized
by
this
particular
company?
why
isn't
that
a
valid
public
purpose?
justice
scalia
so
just
favoring
a
particular
company
and
excluding
other
companies
simply
because
you've
agreed
with
one
company
can
be
all
right?
justice
scalia
no,
but
i
favor
this
company,
because
i
know
the
people.
they've
been
good
citizens
of
this
community.
they're
not
some
fly-by-night
outsider
who's
coming
in.
i
think
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
community
to
favor
this
company.
why
is
that...
why
is
that
not
a
public,
public
motive
rather
than
a
private
motive?
i
mean
can
you
draw
the
line
between
the
two?
justice
scalia
suppose
a
congressman
from
detroit
agrees
with
general
motors
that,
that
he
thinks
it's,
it's
in
the
interest
of
general
motors
and
hence
of
his
district
to
keep
out
all
foreign
car
imports
and
he
says,
you
know,
i,
i...
that's
what
i'm
going
to
do.
and
the
congressman
says,
is
that
contrary
to
public
policy?
is
that?
justice
scalia
yeah,
to
favor
a
particular
local
company.
justice
scalia
the,
the
congressman
would
have
to
talk
to
japanese
automakers
before
he
could
agree
with
general
motors--
justice
scalia
--let's
keep
out
japanese
imports.
justice
antonin
scalia
omni
outdoor
advertising
incorporated
entered
the
billboard
market
in
the
city
of
columbia,
south
carolina
in
1981.
in
response
to
the
new
competition,
columbia
outdoor
advertising
incorporated,
coa
which
at
that
time
controlled
more
than
95%
of
the
columbia
market,
lobbied
city
officials
to
enact
zoning
ordinances
restricting
billboard
construction.
after
such
ordinances
were
passed,
omni,
the
new
entrant,
filed
suit
against
coa
and
the
city.
both
petitioners
here,
under
sections
one
and
two
of
the
sherman
act
alleging
that
the
ordinances
were
the
result
of
an
anti-competitive
conspiracy.
omni
obtained
jury
verdict
on
all
counts,
but
the
district
court
set
the
verdict
aside
and
entered
judgment
for
petitioners
on
the
ground
that
their
activities
were
outside
the
scope
of
the
federal
anti-trust
laws.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
and
reinstated
the
jury
verdict.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
and
hold
that
both
the
city
and
coa
are
immune
from
federal
anti-trust
liability
for
their
activities
involving
the
billboard
ordinances.
in
1943,
in
a
case
called
parker
versus
brown,
we
held
that
the
governmental
acts
of
the
states
are
not
covered
by
the
sherman
act.
later
cases
have
recognized
that
this
immunity
also
extends
to
the
governmental
acts
of
municipalities
when
they
are
acting
pursuant
to
a
power
delegated
by
the
states
to
restrict
competition.
we
hold
that
the
grant
of
the
zoning
of
authority
qualifies
as
such
a
delegation
so
that
the
city's
zoning
actions
have
parker
immunity.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
however,
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
exception
to
parker
that
strips
the
city
of
its
immunity
since
the
city
conspired
with
officers
of
coa
to
impose
the
anti-competitive
ordinance.
we
hold
that
there
is
no
such
exception.
a
conspiracy
exception
would
render
parker
immunity
and
nullity
if
it
applied
to
all
agreements
between
government
regulators
and
private
parties.
in
our
democratic
system,
it
is
both
inevitable
and
desirable
that
public
officials
agree
to
do
what
one
or
another
group
of
private
citizens
urges
upon
them,
nor
is
it
feasible
to
limit
a
conspiracy
exception
to
those
agreements
with
private
parties
that
are
corrupt
in
the
loose
sense
that
they
further
private
interests
at
the
expense
of
the
public
interest.
virtually,
all
government
regulatory
action
is
open
to
such
a
general
charge,
and
if
public
officials
had
to
risk
ex
post
facto
judicial
determination
of
liability
on
the
basis
of
such
a
standard,
state
action
would
be
hamstrung.
and
finally,
it
would
not
be
proper
to
establish
a
conspiracy
exception
limited
exclusively
to
actions
taken
in
exchange
for
bribes
or
for
some
other
violation
of
law,
since
it
is
the
function
of
the
sherman
act
to
regulate
private
trade
restraints
not
to
supplement
government
ethics
laws.
in
addition
to
finding
the
city
immune
under
parker,
we
find
the
private
company,
coa,
immune
under
a
car
larry
to
parker
known
as
the
north
pennington
doctrine.
pursuant
to
that
doctrine,
the
federal
anti-trust
laws
do
not
regulate
the
conduct
of
private
individuals
in
seeking
anti-competitive
action
from
the
government.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
doctrine
does
not
apply
hear
because
coa's
lobbying
activities
with
respect
to
the
ordinances,
were
a
sham.
that
was
error.
the
sham
exception
to
the
north
pennington
doctrine
applies
only
when
a
private
party
uses
the
governmental
process
not
for
the
genuine
purpose
of
achieving
the
governmental
action
requested,
including
anti-competitive
governmental
action
but
rather
for
the
purpose
of
causing
competitive
harm.
a
good
example
would
be
the
regular
filing
of
frivolous
objections
to
a
competitor's
request
for
government
licenses,
knowing
that
the
challenges
would
be
denied
but
hoping
to
cause
the
competitor
expense
and
delay
in
defending
against.
here,
of
course,
coa's
lobbying
was
not
a
sham.
if
anything,
it
was
too
much
in
earnest.
finally,
we
reject
omni's
suggestion
that
we
adapt
a
conspiracy
exception
to
north
pennington
for
largely
the
same
reasons
that
we
have
rejected
such
an
exception
to
parker.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
white
and
marshall
have
joined.
