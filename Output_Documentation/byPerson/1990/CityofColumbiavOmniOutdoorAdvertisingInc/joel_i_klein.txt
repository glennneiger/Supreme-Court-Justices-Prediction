mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners,
the
city
of
columbia,
south
carolina
and
coa,
a
private
billboard
company
were
found
to
have
violated
the
antitrust
laws
by
conspiring
to
restrain
competition
through
the
passage
of
two
zoning
ordinances.
the
principal
question
presented
is
whether
such
ordinances,
even
though
they
satisfy
this
court's
test
in
town
of
hallie,
can
nevertheless
violate
the
antitrust
laws
if
their
enactment
was
motivated
by
the
city's
desire
to
benefit
a
private
business
rather
than
the
public
at
large.
we
submit
that
they
cannot
for
two
related
reasons.
first,
municipal
regulation
that
meets
the
hallie
test
is
deemed
to
be
the
sovereign
action
of
the
state
and
under
parker
such
action
is
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
regardless
of
legislative
motive
and,
second,
under
the
noerr-pennington
doctrine,
the
sherman
act
likewise
doesn't
apply
to
a
private
party's
successful
effort
to
seek
such
an
ordinance.
if
i
may
then
begin
with
the
judgment
against
the
city.
the
scope
of
the
parker
doctrine
was
set
out...
the
scope
of
the
state
action
exemption,
excuse
me,
was
set
out
in
parker
where
the
court
made
plain
that
the
sherman
act
doesn't
cover
a
market
restraint
imposed
by
the
state
as
sovereign.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
that's
a
generic
exception
based
on
the
source
of
the
restraint.
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
that
very
point,
including
recently
in
hoover
v.
ronwin,
where
it
stated
that
quote
"when
a
state
legislature
adopts
legislation,
its
actions
ipso
facto
are
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws.
"
indeed
in
ronwin
itself,
the
court
squarely
rejected
an
exception
to
parker
based
on
the
kind
of
claim
at
issue
here.
in
that
instance
that
a
private
bar
association
and
a
state
supreme
court
had
conspired
to
take
action
motivated
by
a
desire
to
protect
the
economic
interests
of
lawyers.
now
if
we
agree
that
had
south
carolina
passed
this
statute,
if
would
be
exempt.
the
question
remaining
is
whether
the
city
is
entitled
to
a
lesser
measure
of
parker
protection.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
question--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--my,
my
understanding
from
the
rationale
is
that
they
would
have
reached
the
same
result.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
my
view.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i,
i
think
that
is
the
answer.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
though
that
there
are
two
questions.
first,
is
this
the
same
as
the
state?
and
i
think
there
is
at
least
some
suggestion
been
made
that
it
isn't.
but
i
do
think
if
it
is--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--that,
that
is
my
view.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
and
i
think
the
answer
is
as
you
suggest,
justice
white,
that
that's
what
town
of
hallie
compels.
hallie
says
in
a
court
of
appeals
felt...
ruled
that
it
was
met
here...
hallie
says
that
once
a
municipal
ordinance
passes
its
test,
it
is
in
fact
the
sovereign
action
of
the
state.
that's
what
the
analysis
calls
for.
once
that's
so,
as
justice
white
has
just
suggested,
that
cities
get
the
same
measure
of
parker
protection
as
do
the
states
and
for
each
that
measure
of
protection
doesn't
turn
on
the
hows
or
the
whys
behind
the
particular
ordinance.
now
the
court
of
appeals...
correctly
as
you
point
out,
justice
white...
took
the
contrary
view
and
it
fashioned
a
rule,
that
is,
it
found
an
exception
to
parker
based
on
the
notion
that
congress
wanted
to
strike
down
governmental
action
when
taken
for
the
wrong
motives.
we
simply
don't
think
that's
a
plausible
view
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
by
making
antitrust
liability
turn
on
the
political
process,
the
fourth
circuit
has
read
into
the
sherman
act
an
intent
to
regulate
politics.
but
this
court
has
already
made
clear
congress
had
no
such
intent.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
if
the
city
council
had
been
bribed
that
would
not
be
an
antitrust
violation.
and
that
is--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--absolutely.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
and
we
think
that
for
several
reasons.
first,
again--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--under
my
first
theory
i
have
to
say
it.
my
second
theory,
justice
white,
which,
which
i
don't
think
the
court
need
reach,
is
that
this
case
doesn't
involve
bribery
at
all.
but
in
any
case
i,
my
first
position
is
as
you
suggest.
and
i
say
that
for
several
reasons.
one,
bribery
is
a
political
issue.
it's
a
political
question
and
the
court
has
already
said
the
sherman
act
doesn't
regulate
politics.
second,
once
you
open
up
this
kind
of
exception
you're
going
to
totally
undermine
the
rationale
of
parker
itself.
in
that
case,
of
course,
the
court
explained
that
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
indication
from
congress,
it
was
not
prepared,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
conclude
that
the
antitrust
laws
meant
to
restrict
a
state's
sovereign
prerogatives.
yet
that's
precisely
what
an
inquiry
based
on
governmental
motive
would
do.
let's
take,
for
example,
the
kind
of
zoning
ordinance
at
issue
in
this
case.
that
ordinance
obviously
serves,
such
ordinances
routinely
serve
a
public
purpose.
yet,
they
necessarily
restrain
trade,
because
by
definition
they
restrict
supply.
given
that
set
of
circumstances
it's
no
surprise
that
a
private
party--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i,
i
think
it
might,
your
honor.
it's
a
question
that
is
i
think
the
city
would
have
that
power
under
south
carolina
law.
now
then
the
question
would
be
whether
it
acts--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no
question
that
would,
that
would
violate
the
commerce
clause
presumably--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
believe
it
would
if
it
was
properly
authorized
under
hallie.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
it
could.
i
think
the
inquiry
under
hallie
is...
in
order
to
protect
those
zoning
interests...
in
other
words
the
basic
interests
in
restricting
undue
clutter
and
so
forth--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--the
city
would
take
that
approach
consistent
with
the
antitrust
laws.
yes,
sir?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
it
wouldn't
be
because
frankly...
if
i
can
fight
the
premise,
justice
scalia...
i
don't
think
that
it
wouldn't
be
state
action.
in
fact,
if
i
refer
you
to
the
bates
case,
this
court
found
that
that
action
there
was
protected
by
parker
even
though
it
violated
the
first
amendment.
that
is
the
validity
well
known
under
state
law,
of
a
state...
of
an
action.
it
doesn't
test
state
action.
i
mean
that's
of
course
the
whole
rationale
of
monroe
v.
peyton
and
so
forth.
so
i
don't
think
it
turns
on
that
kind
of
inquiry.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but,
but
i,
i
don't
think
that's
consistent
with
bates
and
frankly
that
is,
i
think,
that's
flatly
what
the
court
held
in
bates.
but
frankly
i
think
it
would
be
an
impossible
rule.
what
it
would
mean,
justice
scalia,
is
that
whenever
you
have
an
antitrust
case,
the
first
issue
would
be
this
kind
of
case.
did
the
state...
did
the
city
violate
state
law
or
did
the
state
violate
state
law?
sometimes
that's
going
to
turn
on
a
jury
trial.
sometimes
it's
going
to
be
a
procedural
default,
so
antitrust
courts
would
be
in
the
business
of
essentially
having
a
state
case
first
as
a
prerequisite
to
jurisdiction
and
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
sense.
now
the
other
thing
i
want
to
suggest
aside
from
the
fact
that
once
you
allow...
once
you
acknowledge
that
zoning
laws
are
going
to
lead
to
people
who
benefit
from
them
lobbying
aggressively,
making
campaign
contributions,
then
if
you
allow
that
to
lead
to
an
antitrust
case,
you're
going
to
undo
parker
all
together.
because
every
time,
just
as
in
this
case,
one
person
wins,
one
person
loses,
then
the
threat
or
the
actuality
of
an
antitrust
action
is
there
and
that
i
understood
was
what
parker
tried
to
prevent.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that,
that
issue--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--that's
not
been
argued
before
this
court.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
correct
as
well.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i,
i
don't
believe
you
do,
but
if--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
here,
but
i
think
if
the
issue
was
here
the
answer
is
clear
and
let
me,
let
me
make,
make
that...
what
i
mean
by
that
paren.
that
is
this,
this...
the
city
didn't
confer
a
franchise.
this
was
an
open
market
and
coa
had
developed
a
significant,
very
significant
market
share.
under
south
carolina
law
expressly,
cities
are
encouraged
to
zone,
to
zone
billboards.
that
is
affirmatively
encouraged.
now
i
submit
that
that
must...
it
must
take
into
recognition
that
there
will
be
anticompetitive
effects.
it
may
not
be
a
monopoly.
it
could
be
an
oligopoly
or
what
have
you.
second
of
all,
south
carolina
goes
so
far...
and
in
this
sense
i
think
this
is
a
stronger
case
than
hallie...
it
goes
so
far
as
to
say
with
respect
to
federal
highways
which
the
city
has
passed
an
ordinance,
federal-funded
highways.
if
a...
which
the
state
has
an
ordinance...
if
a
city
ordinance
is
stricter
than
the
state's
with
respect
to
billboard
zoning,
the
city
ordinance
trumps
the
state's.
so
i
think
this
is
a
clear
case
within
hallie.
now
let
me
also
suggest
if
you
start
down
this
path...
mind
you
we're
now
looking
at
the
antitrust
laws,
and
if
you
start
down
that
path,
courts
are
going
to
have
to
resolve
a
series
of
questions
that
go
to
the
heart
of
the
political
process
without
any
guidance
from
congress
whatsoever.
for
example,
how
should
the
courts
identify
the
substantive
standard
for
deciding
what
state
action
is
protected
by
parker
and
what
isn't?
now
we've
talked
some
about
bribery.
the
fourth
circuit
seemed
to
think
that
favoritism
toward
a
private
constituent
or
perhaps
some
campaign
contributions...
that's
a
difficult
area
when
it
comes
to
government
relations...
process.
how
about
causation?
how
do
we
deal
with
causation
in
this
kind
of
situation?
must
a
majority
of
the
legislators
have
been
affected
by
the
taint
or
just
the
margin
by
which
it
won?
and
how
about
as
to
each
individual
legislator?
that
is
to
say,
does
it
have
to
be
a
sole
motive,
dominant
motive,
or
some
lesser
standard
acceptable?
we
just
think
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
wanted
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
to
address
all
of
those
political
concerns;
and
they're
delicate
ones
under
the
antitrust
laws.
now
in
the
time
remaining--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
that's
true
under
the
antitrust
laws,
justice
white.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
maybe--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--and
it
may
violate
the
commerce
clause
or
other
provisions.
but
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
it's
just
not
an
anti...
antitrust
concern.
and
of
course,
i
mean
as
far
as
the
antitrust
laws
go,
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
instances
the
state
can
give
a
sole
franchise
to
a
business;
taxicabs,
at...
airports,
to
a
cable
tv
station.
that's
never
been
a
question.
now
if
the
private
party--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't...
i
think,
i
think
it
may--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--depending
on
the
circumstances,
yes.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
circumstances
are
that
if
the
city
decides
that
one
company--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--it,
it
does
have
that
authority
i
think.
just
as
in,
in--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--under
the
antitrust--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--under
the
antitrust
laws
and
i,
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
that
i
think
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
zoning.
i
mean
justice
stevens
asked.
it
may
be
true
that
the
results
of
the
zoning
order--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--it
may
not,
but
i
think
this
one
was
clear
and
i
also
would
suggest
that
every
zoning
ordinance,
if
in
fact
there
is
a
single
chain
and
the
city
passes
an
ordinance,
it's
going
to
protect
it
just
like
a
taxicab
franchise
and
so
forth.
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
difference--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
city
hasn't
make
that
decision
either.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
city
has
made
a
decision
that
there
shall
be--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--spacing
and
let
me
look
at
town
of
hallie
for
you,
because
the
court
was
unanimous
there.
in
town
of
hallie
what
the
state
of
wisconsin
told
the
city
was
that
you
could
set
up
a
sewerage
service
and
you
could
define
your
market
for
service
as
you
see
fit.
it
didn't
say
you
could
exclude
competitors,
didn't
say
you
could
only
serve
those
people
that
didn't
sweat
in
your
market.
the
court
had
no
trouble
finding
that
it
was
authorized
for
parker.
now
this
case
i
think
is
easier,
because
the
state
has
said
you
should
enact
these
kind
of
ordinances
and
if
yours
is
stricter
than
ours,
we'll
defer
to
yours.
now
if
i
could,
in
the
limited
time
remaining,
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
couple
of
words
about
the
noerr...
the
coa
liability
and
i
think
much
of
the--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--yes,
yes,
they
were.
yes.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
now
if,
if
i,
if
i
might
then
i,
i
think
much
of
the
discussion
about
whether
there's
a
coconspiracy
exception
so
to
speak,
it's
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
so
i
think
it
applies
here.
but
let
me...
it
applies
to
coa
as
well.
but
let
me
make
two
brief
points.
first
of
all,
if
the
ordinances
are
valid
under
parker,
under
parker
and
hallie,
it
follows
automatically
that
coa,
the
private
party,
is
protected
under
noerr,
and
second,
that
coa's
activities
in
any
case
are
independently
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
respondent's
belated
suggestion
frankly
prompted
some
questions
that
this
case
involves
bribery
or
extortion
is
just
flatly
wrong.
as
to
our
first
point,
that
is
the
noerr
point
simpliciter,
the
question
is
whether
congress...
did
it
intend
the
sherman
act
to
police
lobbying
activities
even
when
it
has
no
intention
to
police
the
resulting
governmental
restraint?
that's
what
parker
immunity
means.
that
question
was
answered
30
years
ago
in
noerr
where
the
court
held
flatly
that
the
antitrust
laws
have
no
concern
with
the
methods
used
to
influence
valid
legislative
action.
it's
a
view
that
the
court
has
never
deviated
from
since
and
was
recently
reaffirmed
in
allied
tube
a
couple
of
years
ago.
finally,
and
in
all
events,
the
judgment
against
the
private
petitioner,
coa,
must
be
reversed
regardless
of
the
city's
protection.
the
activities
on
which
that
judgment
rests
are
constitutionally
protected.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
allegation,
no
proof
and
no
jury
instruction
to
support
a
finding
that
coa
bought
these
ordinances
with
a
few
relatively
modest,
properly
disclosed
campaign
contributions
made
over
a
6-year
period.
without
that
kind
of
express
finding,
campaign
contributions
are
fully
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
they
are,
as
justice
white
said
in
united
states
v.
brewer,
a
routine
and
well-established
part
of
our
political
process,
often
made
with
the
expectation
or
hope
that
a
legislature...
legislator
will
champion
a
constituent's
point
of
view.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
regret
burdening
the
court
with
issues
of
the
record,
but
i
view
bribery
as
a
very
serious
charge.
and
i
don't
think
it
should
be
made
without
support.
first
of
all,
the
issue
of
how
this
case
was
tried,
i
suggest
the
court
look
at
page
59
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
respondent's
argument
to
the
jury
and
the
instructions
have
nothing
to
do
with
bribery.
more
significantly,
the
issue
of
free
campaign
contributions,
the
facts--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't,
your
honor,
but
it
came
after
a
variety
of
other
legal
positions
had
been
rejected.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
we
don't,
no,
sir.
second
of
all,
the
issue
in
response
to
justice
marshall
about
what
these
campaign
contributions
are,
i
just
say
briefly...
the
court
can
check
the
record...
there
was
one
contribution
of
free
billboard
space
to
the
mayor
when
he
was
running
for
city
council
in
1978.
the
mayor
declared
that
as
a
contribution
on
his
campaign
disclosure
form
that's
in
the
record.
second--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--there
were
six
billboards.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
six
billboards.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
six
billboards.
second,
there
were
two
reduced
fee,
that
is,
approximately
a
one-third
discount
off
the
official
rate,
that
is
the
card
rate.
both
city
council
members
that
received
that...
they
were
after
this
litigation
was
instigated...
both
city
council
members
who
received
those
declared
them
as
expenditures
on
their
form
because
they
paid,
that
is,
their
staffs
paid
$550
out
of
$750.
next,
respondent
in
question,
in
answering
you,
justice
scalia,
says
they
proved
that
a
majority
was
involved.
let
me
say
two
things
on
that.
the
court
of
appeals,
their
brief's
position
was
one
was
enough.
but
second,
they
pointed
out
that
three
people
that
they
said
made
up
the
majority.
one
of
those
three
people
was
mr.
adams,
who
the
record
will
show
received
no
campaign
contribution
at
any
time
from
any
of
my
clients.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
there
were
none
that
were
not
declared.
the
discount,
justice
stevens,
was...
in
other
words,
say
the
billboards
would
have
cost
$600--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--they
were
declared
as
expenditures
which
they
were
paid
for,
the
ones
that
were
discounted.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
okay,
now,
and
one
of
the
three
people
who
is
identified
as
a
so-called
conspirator
received
no
campaign
contributions.
and
finally,
let
me
end
by
suggesting
to
the
court,
if
this
was
a
case
about
bribery,
there's
a
federal
law
right
on
point.
it's
the
rico
statute.
they
could
have
brought
this
case
and
proved
it.
and
what's
going
on
here
and
what
i
think
everyone
will
try
to
do
with
the
antitrust
laws
is
you
start
with
government
regulation
that
is
necessarily
and
frequently
restraining.
it's
better
to
have...
instead
of
having
to
prove
corruption,
you
smuggle
a
corruption
case
under
the
antitrust
laws.
congress
has
spoken
in
one
area.
there's
no
reason
to
open
up
another.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
in
the
eighth
circuit?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
believe
it
would
in
the
eighth
circuit.
it
certainly
would
not
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
in
the
fifth
this
case
probably
would
have
come
out
under
affiliated
capital
the
same
way.
but
in
the
eighth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
seventh
circuit,
in
fact,
in
metro
cable--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--with
this
decision?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
there's
a
case
by
justice
kennedy
in
the
ninth
circuit.
there's
a
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
metro
cable.
there's
a
case
called
boone
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
several
others.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
coconspirator
exception?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
believe
that's
so,
although
a
variety
of...
even
in
the
fifth
circuit,
there's
some
inconsistencies,
but
i
believe
they
are...
now
they
in
the
fourth.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
eighth
in
a
case
called
kay
jeer
i
think
has
talked
about
it
but
not
with
the
same
clarity
as
the
fourth,
that
is,
it
hasn't
demarked
the
lines.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
there
is
some
language,
that's
correct.
but
i
also
think
there's
other
language
in
there
that's
helpful.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
no
party
requested
such
instructions,
justice
kennedy.
thank
you.
