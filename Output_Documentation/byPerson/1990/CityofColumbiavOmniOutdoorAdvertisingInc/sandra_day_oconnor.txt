justice
o'connor
mr.
klein,
could
i
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
question
and
inquiry.
now
the
courts
below
clearly
found
that
the
zoning
law
met
the
town
of
hallie
test?
justice
o'connor
and
there's
no
cross
appeal--
justice
o'connor
--on
that.
justice
o'connor
although
the
respondent
does
raise
in
a,
a
footnote,
i
believe,
the
argument
again,
that
town
of
hallie
doesn't
even
apply.
justice
o'connor
do
we
need
to
address
that,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
i
mean
if
we
have
the
concerns
that
justice
stevens
expressed
that
perhaps
a
zoning
ordinance
authority
does
not
enable
towns
to
purposely
exclude
everybody
but
one
from
a
particular
business.
justice
o'connor
where
is,
where,
where
do
we
find
the
discussion
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
1980
agreement?
well,
don't
take
up
a
lot
of
your
time
to
try
to
find
it.
i
just
hadn't
noticed
any
particular
discussion
about
it
and
i
wondered
what
you
were
relying
on,
but--
justice
o'connor
--did,
did
the
court
of
appeals
characterize
it
as
an
agreement?
