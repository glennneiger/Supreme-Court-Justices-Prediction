justice
white
what
do
you
think
would
have
happened
if
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
held
if
the
state
had
passed
this
statute?
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
well,
then
if
you
say
we
all
agree,
we've
already
decided
the
case.
justice
white
so
you
shouldn't
say
that.
you're--
justice
white
--but
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
reached
the
same--
justice
white
--all
right.
all
right,
then.
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
city
council
had
been
bribed?
justice
white
so
you
would
say
that
parker
still
applies?
justice
white
sure.
all
right.
justice
white
i
think
you
have
to
say
that,
i
take
it,
on
your
theory.
justice
white
i
suppose
that
you
would
say
that,
that
this
city
council
just
went
to
a
lot
of
trouble
for
nothing.
they
could
just
have
passed
an
ordinance
and
said
that
nobody
but
x
may
put
up
billboards
in
town,
as
far
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
concerned.
justice
white
yes,
it
may
not
be
consistent
with
state
laws
or
something--
justice
white
--but
as
far
as
the
antitrust
laws,
they
can
do
that.
justice
white
yeah,
but
mr.
klein,
the...
i
thought
the
parker
rule
always
required
that
the
state
statute
clearly
articulate,
very
clearly
articulate
that
the
locality
may
replace
competition
with
noncompetition.
justice
white
it...
that
may
not
be
a
clear
articulation
of
local
power.
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
a
certain...
before
you
do
that.
did
the
city...
were
these
ordinances
passed
pursuant
to
their
zoning
power?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
i
thought
that
was
from
parker?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
okay.
go
ahead.
justice
white
well,
that's
a...
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
one.
justice
white
i,
i--
justice
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
think
there
was
such
an
agreement?
justice
white
mr.
klein,
would
this
case
have
come
out
the
same
way
in
the
fifth
and
eighth
circuits?
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
how
about
the
fifth?
justice
white
have
there...
are
there
cases
that
would
show
that,
that
are
in
direct
conflict
with
the
decision
alone?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
is
the
fifth
circuit
the
only
one
that
is,
that
has
so
recognized
a
so-called
conspirator?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
the
eighth
has
never
approached--
justice
white
--well,
there's
some
pretty
interesting
language
in
the
eighth
circuit
case
against
you,
isn't
there?
