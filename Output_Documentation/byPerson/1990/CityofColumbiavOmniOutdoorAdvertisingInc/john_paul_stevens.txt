justice
stevens
but
mr.
klein,
do
you
think
that
the
zoning
power
would
give
the
city
the
authority
to
grant
a
exclusive
franchise
in
the
billboard
advertising
field
to
a
particular
company?
justice
stevens
you
think
it
has
the
power
to
grant...
say
it
was
given
an
exclusive
franchise
in
all
the
restaurants
in
town
so
that
presumably
it
could
zone
restaurants.
it
could
have
given
an
exclusive
franchise
to
one
chain
of
restaurants,
say
no
other
chains
can
come
into
the
town.
justice
stevens
well,
what
about
the
antitrust
law?
justice
stevens
well,
but
would
it
be
properly
authorized
under
hallie
simply
because
the
state
had
give
the
city
the
zoning
power?
would
the
zoning
power...
could
it
be
properly
used
within
hallie
to
grant
exclusive
franchises
to
various
kinds
of
businesses?
justice
stevens
that
you
can
give
them...
give
all
the
business
to
one
particular--
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
do
you
think
the
zoning
ordinance...
the
power
to
zone
normally
implicitly
includes
the
power
to
grant
exclusive
franchises?
justice
stevens
i
think
you
do.
justice
stevens
well,
what
are
the
circumstances?
justice
stevens
if
the
city
decides
it
wants
to
do
it.
it
can't
be
the
city's
decision
if
you
say
the
grant
from
the
state
embraces
that,
then
the
city
always
has
that
authority.
justice
stevens
just
in
franchises
and
fast
food
operations
and
billboards
and--
justice
stevens
--motion
picture
theaters,
all
because
they
have
the
power
to
zone.
justice
stevens
well,
the
taxicab
franchise
authority
doesn't
rest
on
the
zoning
power.
justice
stevens
it
rests,
rests
on
a
deliberate
decision
to
have
one
operator
in
a
particular
field
of
business.
but
i
don't
understand
the
state
has
made
a
decision
that
there
shall
be
only
one
billboard
operator
in
each
city.
justice
stevens
or
has
it
delegated
the
power
to
the
city?
justice
stevens
there
shall
be
zoning.
justice
stevens
but
as
i
understand
your
case,
you're
not
claiming
the
individual
councilmen
are
conspirators.
you're
claiming
the
city
is,
aren't
you?
justice
stevens
the
conspiracy
is
between
the
city
and
your
competitor?
justice
stevens
that's
right.
justice
stevens
excuse
me,
when
you
say
they,
did...
did
you...
i
forget
the
numbers
of
people
on
the
city
council...
did
you
establish
that
it
was
a
majority
of
the
city
council--
justice
stevens
--that
was
in
effect
with
free
billboard
space
and
all
that
thing.
justice
stevens
yes,
mr.
lewis,
but
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
the
noerr
aspect
of
the
case
on
the
sham
theory
rather
than
the
coconspirator
theory,
didn't
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
klein,
would
you
help
me
on
the
defendant's
requested
charge
that
your
opponent
referred
to?
do
you
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
justice
stevens
so
you
don't
endorse
that
position
anymore?
justice
stevens
mr.
klein,
are
telling
us,
because
this
is
such
a
sharp
contradiction
here,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
your
opponent's
claim
that
there
were
some
either
discounted
billboards
or
free
billboards
provided
that
were
not
declared?
justice
stevens
well,
you
can
kind
of
say
yes
or
no,
i
think,
to
my
question.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
if
they...
if
the
price
was
$1,000
and
they
paid
$600,
they
reported
the
payment
of
$600,
but
they
did
not
report
the
fact
they
got
a
$400
discount.
justice
stevens
i
see.
