chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1671,
the
city
of
columbia
and
columbia
outdoor
advertising
v.
omni
outdoor
advertising.
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
klein.
mr.
lewis
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
are
you
saying
was
a
sham
here,
mr.
lewis?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's,
that's
not
a...
to
say
that
an
agreement
was,
was
a
sham
is
not
consistent
with
our
cases.
our
cases
talk
about
a
sham
exception
as
being
the
use
of
a
governmental
process
in
some
way
simply
to
delay
without
any
hope
of
success.
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
these
people
had
not
only
a
hope
of
success,
they
succeeded
with
the
city
council.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
sham
exception,
that
they
gave
favors
for
billboards?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
where,
where
does
all
this
language
that
you're
using
come
from
that
they
usurped
the
process,
they
shut
down
the
process?
does
that
come
from
our
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what,
what
cases
of
ours
do
those
two
phrases
that
you
just
used
come
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
were
certainly
able
to
make
your
views
known
to
the
city's
representatives.
you
say
they
were
biased
against
you,
but
as
a
factual
matter
you
were
certainly
able
to
make
your
views
known.
were
you
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
were,
were
you
able?
were
you
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
were
you
able
to
make
your
views
known
to
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i,
i
thought
the
record
showed
otherwise
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
okay...
just,
just
a
minute.
you
say
you
went
to
meetings
that
were
closed.
if
they
were
closed,
how
did
you
get
in?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that,
that's
quite
different
from
being
unable
to
make
your
views
known.
the
fact
they
didn't
listen
to
your
views
or
pay
attention
to
them,
doesn't
mean
that
you
didn't
have,
you
didn't
have
some
sort
of
a
way
of
expressing
yourself.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
will
make
a
lot
of
legislative
committee
hearings
subject
to
some
sanctions.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you
didn't
cross-petition
for
certiorari
though,
did
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you...
mr.
lewis,
your
time
has
expired.
please
sit
down.
mr.
klein,
do
you
have
any
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klein.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1671
city
of
columbia
versus
omni
outdoor
advertising,
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
