justice
whittaker
now,
mr.
dyk,
you
don't
take
the
position
that
all
pro
se
litigants
are
eligible
for
attorneys'
fees,
just
those
who
are
attorneys?
justice
whittaker
well,
the
statute
also
refers
to
prevailing
parties,
which
might
more
easily
be
read
to
cover
all
than
just
attorneys.
i
thought
it
was
curious
that
you
limited
your
argument.
justice
whittaker
well,
if
you...
if
you
look
to
the
language
the
phrase
"attorneys'
fee",
isn't
the
more
natural
meaning
of
that
to
presuppose
that
there
is
an
attorney-client
relationship?
justice
whittaker
true,
but
it
may
still
contemplate
an
attorney-client
relationship.
justice
whittaker
what
about
that
old
saw
that
he
who
represents
himself
has
a
fool
for
a
client?
justice
whittaker
maybe
congress
had
in
mind
that
people
should
get
attorneys
in
order
to
vindicate
civil
rights
causes
of
action.
justice
whittaker
well,
i
suppose
organizations,
corporations
and
other
organizations
have
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
i
mean,
they
can't
come
in
as
a
corporation
and
represent
themselves.
they
have
to
have
an
attorney
there,
house
counsel
or
otherwise,
don't
they?
justice
whittaker
well,
what
about
the
house
counsel's
situation
or
the
pro
bono
organization's
situation?
