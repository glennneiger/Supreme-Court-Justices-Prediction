justice

well,
the
whole
idea
of
our
profession
is
that
that
degree
of
insulation,
independence,
and
professionalism
prevails
because
there
is
a
distance
between
you
and
the
client.
and
you
would
concede
on
the
one
hand
that
a
pro
se
who
is
not
an
attorney
cannot
get
the
fees,
and
yet
you
would
create
for
the
legal
profession
this
little
option
where
they
could
represent
themselves.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
somewhat
detracts
from
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
asking
for
professional
representation.
justice
jr.
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
the
same
about
some
pro
se's
who
are
not
attorneys.
