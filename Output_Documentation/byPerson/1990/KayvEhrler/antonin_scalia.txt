justice
scalia
is
that,
is
that
for
certain,
mr.
dyk?
i'm
not
sure.
do
you
know
of
any
cases
where
a
partnership
appears
pro
se?
justice
scalia
mr.
dyk,
i
don't
understand
how
you
make
that
distinction.
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
the
person
who
gets
the
award
is
simply
described
in
the
statute
as
the
prevailing
party,
which
would
include
anybody,
attorneys
or
not.
the
award
is
described
as
attorney's
fees,
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee,
but
you're
ignoring
the
word
fee.
there
isn't
any
fee,
nobody
has
paid
any
money
to
anybody,
so
why
not
ignore
the
word
attorney's
too?
i
mean,
it's
just
a
description
of
what
the
money
is
for,
not
a
description
of
what,
what
the
function
actually
is.
justice
scalia
but
it
also
assumes
that
there
is
a
charge,
and
we
have
ignored
that
assumption
because
we
allow
pro
bono
attorneys
to,
we
allow
the
recovery
of
fees
for
pro
bono
attorneys.
justice
scalia
so
if
we
ignore
the
one,
why
can't
we
ignore
the
other?
justice
scalia
you
would
apply
that
to
all
organizations,
including
partnerships?
you
disagree
with
mr.
dyk
as
to
whether
a
partnership
can
appear
pro
se?
