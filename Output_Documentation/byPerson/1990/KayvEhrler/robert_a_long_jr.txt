mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
a
point
mr.
dyk
raised.
he
referred
to
pro
se
organizations,
and
there
was
also
a
question
whether
a
partnership
can
litigate
pro
se.
our
understanding
is
that
the
general
rule
is
that
organizations
cannot
litigate
pro
se.
that
is
certainly
true
of
corporations,
and
we
think
that
is
the
majority
rule
as
to
partnerships
and
also
as
to
unincorporated
associations.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it
could
not
appear
through
its
president
or
through
some
officer
of
the
corporation.
it
has
to
hire
a
member
of
the
bar
to
represent
it.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think
that
then
the
courts
have
allowed
the
attorney--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
that
would
be
the
in-house
counsel
situation,
and
that
is
certainly
okay.
i
might
add--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--we
think
the
general
rule
is
they
are
not,
and
the
cases
on
this
are
collected
under
28
u.s.
code
1654,
which
is
a
statute
we
did
not
cite
in
our
brief,
but
that
is
a
statute
that
generally
gives
all
parties
in
federal
courts
a
right
to
conduct
their
own
cases
personally
or
by
counsel.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
the
language
of
section
1988
which
provides
that
a
prevailing
party
other
than
the
united
states
may
recover
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs
answers
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
the
word
"attorney"
ordinarily
denotes
a
person
who
is
both
licensed
to
practice
law
and
who
acts
as
the
representative
or
agent
of
a
client.
members
of
the
bar
generally
do
represent
clients,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
a
lawyer
who
litigates
a
case
pro
se
is
functioning
as
an
attorney.
standard
dictionaries
define
attorney
as
the
agent
or
representative
of
another.
and
representation
is
the
essence
of
phrases
such
as
attorney
in
fact
and
power
of
attorney.
we
also
think
other
language
in
section
1988
reinforces
the
conclusion
that
congress
used
attorney
in
its
usual
sense.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
he
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
trust?
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think
in
that
case
it
is
simply
a
pro
se
example.
if
he
were
the
trustee,
he
might
be
acting
on
behalf
of
the
beneficiary
or
the
cestui,
then
he
might
well
be
entitled--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--if
he
is
the
sole
beneficiary,
i
think
our
position
would
be
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
fee.
i
mean,
i
should
add--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
and
in
that
case
he
might
well
get
a
fee.
and
i
should
add
in
general
that
mr.
dyk
rests
a
great
deal
of
his
argument
on
the
proposition
that
this
distinction
between
organizations
and
pro
se
litigants
would
be
very
difficult
to
apply
in
practice.
and
first
of
all
we
think
this
statute
requires
the
distinction,
so
the
difficulty
of
it
is
not
really
an
issue,
but
we
also
think
in
the
ordinary
run
of
cases
it's
not
going
to
be
difficult
to
apply.
it
is
the
kind
of
determination
courts
make
routinely,
for
example
under
this
statute
1654,
also
in
determining
whether
there
is
an
attorney-client
relationship
or
who
the
attorney
represents
in
a
corporate
setting.
it
is
the
kind
of
question
that
courts
can
answer
quite
easily
in
the
borderline
or
difficult
cases
that
may
arise.
but
in
addition
to
a
requirement
of
an
attorney,
there
is
a
requirement
of
an
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs,
and
a
pro
se
litigant
cannot
pay
himself
a
fee.
a
pro
se
lawyer
also
incurs
no
costs
for
legal
services
other
than
opportunity
costs,
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
opportunity
costs
are
compensable
as
attorneys'
fees.
now,
it
is
correct,
as
petitioner
observes,
that
organizations
represented
by
in-house
counsel,
as
well
as
clients
represented
by
attorneys
on
a
pro
bono
basis,
are
eligible
for
fee
awards
under
section
1988.
but
this
does
not
foreclose
reliance
on
the
statutory
language
authorizing
an
award
of
fees
as
a
part
of
costs
for
two
reasons.
first,
organizations
actually
incur
costs
for
representation
by
in-house
attorneys,
although
the
costs
may
be
in
the
form
of
a
flat
fee,
that
is
a
salary,
and
lawyers
who
represent
clients
pro
bono
have
a
fee
arrangement
with
the
client,
even
if
it
is
to
waive
the
fee,
and
more
typically
the
arrangement
is
in
the
nature
of
a
contingent
fee,
that
is
to
recover
any
fee
award
under
section
1988.
second,
the
cases
awarding
attorneys'
fees
to
in-house
counsel
rest
on...
i'm
sorry,
the
second
reason
is
that
the
awards
of
fees
to
organizations
rest
on
the
legislative
history
rather
than
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
we
think
the
legislative
history
simply
doesn't
apply
to
pro
se
lawyers,
because,
as
we
have
already
argued,
pro
se
lawyers
are
easily
distinguished
from
organizations.
we
think
the
language
of
section
1988
answers
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
but
the
legislative
history
reinforces
our
interpretation
of
the
language.
statements
in
the
legislative
history
such
as
"many
citizens
have
little
or
no
money
with
which
to
hire
a
lawyer.
"
indicate
that
congress
had
in
mind
encouraging
plaintiffs
to
obtain
legal
representation
rather
than
litigating
cases
on
their
own,
and
we
think
that
applies
to
lawyer
litigants
as
well
as
to
all
other
litigants.
and
finally,
awarding
attorneys'
fees
to
pro
se
lawyers
would
not
further
the
purpose
of
section
1988,
which
is
to
make
sure
that
competent
counsel
are
available
to
civil
rights
plaintiffs.
at
a
minimum,
it's
certainly
not
necessary
to
adopt
the
result
petitioner
argues
for
to
achieve
the
purpose
of
section
1988,
because
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
lawyers
have
precisely
the
same
ability
to
vindicate
their
civil
rights
as
all
other
litigants,
and
in
fact
they
may
have
a
greater
ability
because
if
they
choose
to
litigate
pro
se
they
can
apply
whatever
additional
skills
they
have.
and
we
also
think,
frankly,
that
encouraging
pro
se
litigation
by
lawyers
would
not
ensure
that
competent
counsel
would
be
available
in
civil
rights
cases.
pro
se
lawyers
often
lack
the
detachment
and
objectivity
that
is
necessary
for
effective
professional
representation.
a
pro
se
lawyer
may
be
inclined
to
focus
on
the
recovery
of
a
fee
to
the
exclusion
of
vindication
of
the
merits.
and
pro
se
litigation
also--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
if
a
lawyer--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--has
a
client,
the
lawyer
has
to
consult
with
the
client
about
various
important
parts
of
the
litigation,
including
settlement
offers,
and
presumably
the
client
is
going
to
be
particularly
interested
in
achieving
the
result
on
the
merits.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
evans
against
jeff
d.
suggests
some
of
that
concern.
section
1988
ensures
effective
access
to
the
courts
for
all
citizens,
including
members
of
the
bar.
a
rule
that
provides
lawyers
with
additional
rights
and
privileges
not
available
to
other
citizens,
with
the
right
to
litigate
pro
se
and
to
recover
an
attorney's
fee,
is
not
justified.
