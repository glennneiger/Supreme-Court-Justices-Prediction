chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-79,
richard
b.
kay
v.
bremer
ehrler
and
kentucky
board
of
elections.
spectators
are
reminded
that
the
court
remains
in
session.
there
is
to
be
no
talking
inside
the
courtroom.
mr.
dyk,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
it
ever
established,
mr.
dyk,
that
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
in
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky,
or
western
district,
wherever
it
was?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
he
was
enabled
to
proceed
in
kentucky
not
because
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar,
but
because
he
was
pro
se?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
at
any
rate
he
was
not
admitted
to
practice
as
an
attorney,
either
for
this
case
or
generally,
in
the
federal
court
in
kentucky?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
all
of
those
cases
the
entity
is
larger
than
the
attorney
who
is
appearing
before
the
court
on
its
behalf.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dyk.
ms.
sheadel,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say,
ms.
sheadel,
that
the
statute
contemplates
an
attorney-client
relationship
which
will
ultimately
give
rise
to
some
sort
of
fee
arrangement.
how
does
the
existence
of
that
sort
of
a
relationship
advance
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
i
mean,
more
so
than
just
an
arrangement
just
where
the...
if
the
attorney
is
pro
se
he
can
get
a
fee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
sheadel.
mr.
long,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how
about
a
voluntary
organization,
say
an
environmental
organization
or,
you
know,
any
one
of
the
groups
that
litigate.
if
they're
simply
an
association,
are
they
allowed
to
appear
in
court
by
one
of
their
members
who
is
not
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
under
your
view
an
organization
would
have
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney,
but
it
could
be
an
attorney
who
was
also
a
member
of
the
organization?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
dyk,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wouldn't
the
statutory
purpose
been
have
served
just
as
well
in
this
case
if
your
client
had
retained
an
attorney
to
represent
him,
and
then
there
would
be
no
question
that
attorney
could
get
an
attorney's
fee?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that,
that's
true
of
any
potential
civil
rights
plaintiff.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
congress
intended
pro
se
attorney
potentially
to
be
more
favorably
situated
with
respect
to
getting
attorneys'
fees
than
the
typical
nonlawyer
civil
rights
plaintiff?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
many
of
them
were
pro
se?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dyk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-79,
kay
against
ehrler
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
