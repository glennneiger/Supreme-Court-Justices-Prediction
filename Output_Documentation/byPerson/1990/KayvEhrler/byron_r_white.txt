justice
white
what
was
the
standing
in
this
case?
justice
white
in
this
case,
yeah.
justice
white
was
he
a
candidate
or
something?
justice
white
are
you
arguing
that...
that
because
a
man
was
a
lawyer
he
didn't
need
to
go
out
and
find
a
good
lawyer?
is
that
it?
and
therefore
congress
didn't
intend
to
have
him
compensated
because
he
didn't
need
to
go
out
and
hunt
a
lawyer?
justice
white
well,
unless
a
pro
se
lawyer
gets
paid,
i
suppose
he
would
be
less
likely
to
bring
a
civil
rights
suit,
because
while
he's
pursuing
it
he
can't
take
any
other
clients.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know
about
that.
the
nonlawyer
pro
se
fellow
hasn't
got
that
problem,
or
may
not
have
that
problem
of
paying
the
rent
and
not
having
any
clients,
not
being
able
to
serve
any
other
clients.
justice
white
well,
it's
certainly
likely
if
the
lawyer,
if
the
fellow
is
making
his
living
as
a
lawyer
it
is
likely
that,
that...
well,
he
normally
doesn't
take
cases
that
interfere
with
his
practice.
justice
white
so
he
won't
be
likely
to
be
going
out
pursuing
civil
rights
cases
if
he's
not
going
to
get
paid.
justice
white
there's
always
the
risk,
naturally
there's
always
the
risk
of
losing.
you
always...
if
you
go
out
and
hire
an
attorney
and
you
have
to
pay
him,
maybe,
win,
lose,
or
draw.
and
if
you
lose
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
him
anyway.
justice
white
well,
would
you...
a
law
partnership
where
a
lawyer
represents
the
partnership,
would
you
treat
the
partnership
and
that
lawyer
like
a...
like
a
corporation?
justice
white
well,
he's
representing
himself,
too.
he's
a
partner
in
the
firm.
justice
white
what,
what
courts
have
been
against
you?
justice
white
are
those,
are
there
only
three
circuits
ruled
on
that?
justice
white
corporations
can't
litigate
pro
se
because
the
corporation
can't
come
into
court?
justice
white
well,
what
if
its
vice
president
is
a
lawyer?
justice
white
they
don't
need
to
go
out
and
hire
anybody.
it's
just
part
of
his
job.
