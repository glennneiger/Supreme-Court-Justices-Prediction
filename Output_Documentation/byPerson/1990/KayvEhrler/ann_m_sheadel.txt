ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
pro
se
litigant
who
is
an
attorney
is
eligible
for
attorneys'
fees
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1988.
the
language
of
42
u.s.c.
section
1988
indicates
that
pro
se
litigants,
whether
attorneys
or
not,
are
not
eligible
for
attorneys'
fees.
the
language
of
that
statute
provides
that
the
court,
in
its
discretion,
may
allow
the
prevailing
party,
other
than
the
united
states,
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
"attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs.
"
in
examining
the
definition
of
attorney's
fee,
we
believe
that
it
becomes
clear
that
pro
se
litigants,
whether
or
not
attorneys,
are
not
eligible
for
fees.
the
phrase
"attorney's
fee"
is
defined
as
meaning
charged
to
client
for
services
rendered,
and
examples
given,
hourly
fee,
flat
fee,
contingency
fee.
looking
at
that
definition,
"charge
to
client
for
services
rendered.
"
indicates
that
there
is
a
presupposition
that
there
are
two
parties,
that
there
is
an
attorney
on
one
hand
and
the
attorney...
client
on
the
other.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes,
your
honor,
but
here--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--we
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
words
in
the
entire
context,
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
costs,
that
it
would
indicate
that
there
is
an
attorney-client
relationship
from
which
a
fee
arrangement
springs.
now
the
fee
arrangement
may
ultimately
be
that
there
might
not
be
an
actual
paying
relationship
other
than
some
kind
of
contingency
fee
arrangement,
such
as
contingency
fee
if
we
lose
the
case
there
are
no
attorneys'
fees
paid,
if
we
win
the
case
attorneys'
fees
will
be
paid
if
attorneys'
fees
are
recovered.
we
do
believe
that
the
language,
looked
at
in
its
entire
context,
indicates
that
there
is
the
requirement
of
an
attorney-client
relationship
from
which
springs
a
fee
arrangement.
we
believe
that
that
is--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--we
believe
that
there
is
still
a
fee
arrangement.
in-house
counsel
is
in
fact
acting
as
retained
counsel
by
the
organization
that
has
hired
it.
in-house
counsel
is
paid
the
retainer
of
the
yearly
salary
and
benefits
to
be
there
for
the
organization
and
to
represent
the
organization
in
any
matters
that
the
organization
requires,
much
as
an
outside
counsel
might
be
put
on
retainer
for
the
same
purpose.
we
believe
that
that
is
the
kind
of...
is
a
kind
of
fee
arrangement
that
would
qualify
as
part
of
this
attorney-client
relationship.
we
believe
that
that
also
is
true
in
the
situation
of
a
pro
bono
attorney
representing
a
client.
that
relationship
also
has
a
fee
arrangement
much
like
a
contingency
fee
arrangement.
if
the
case
is
lost
there
are
no
fees
that
are
paid.
if
the
case
is
won,
fees
are
paid
based
on
whatever
attorneys'
fees
are
recovered.
that
is
a
fee
arrangement
that
stems
from
the
attorney-client
relationship,
the
attorney
representing
his
client
as
anticipated
by
the
language
in
the
statute
itself.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
if
the
petitioner
were
representing
someone
other
than
himself,
then
we
believe
he
would
have
qualified
for
fees
for
that
particular
representation.
but
for
matters
in
which
he
was
representing
himself,
we
would
believe
that
he
would
not
qualify.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
it
may
be
in
that
situation
that
when
the
court
is
asked
to
examine
the
facts
connected
with
it
that
it
might
not
be
possible
to
make
a
distinction.
if
the
common
interests
were
such
that
everything
the
attorney
did
was
on
behalf
of
the
clients
together,
you
might
not
be
able
to
make
a
differentiation.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
it
means
he
would,
if
he
were
representing
a
party
other
than
himself.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
because
there
would
in
fact
be
an
attorney-client
relationship
and
a
fee
arrangement
that
would
stem
from
that.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
the
language
used
by
congress
in
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
was
concerned
with
enabling
individuals
who
might
not
be
able
to
afford
to
hire
attorneys
and
get
into
court
the
means
by
which
they
would
be
able
to
hire
an
attorney
to
represent
him
or
her
in
the
court
in
order
to
vindicate
his
or
her
civil
rights.
congress'
intent
seems
to
us
to
be
that
encouragement...
that
giving
individuals
the
ability
to
hire
attorneys
to
represent
them,
and
was
in
fact
contemplating
the
existence
of
the
attorney-client
relationship
that
we
are
describing.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
we
would
not
say
it
that
way.
we
believe
that
congress
meant
to
treat
all
pro
se
litigants
the
same
in
that
they
were
encouraging
everyone
who
believes
that
he
or
she
should
file
a
civil
rights
action
to
go
and
find
an
attorney
to
represent
him
or
her
in
that
lawsuit.
and
that
would
include
attorneys.
if
attorneys
decide
to
proceed
pro
se,
they
are
making
the
decision
in
the
same
way
that
any
other
litigant
might
make
that
decision.
but
the
congressional
intent
was
to
give
individuals
the
means
by
which
they
could
hire
attorneys
to
represent
them.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
we
don't
believe
he
would
be
any
less
likely
to
bring
the
suit
than
any
other
individual
who
is
contemplating
it.
certainly
the
attorney
always
has
the
opportunity
to
hire--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--it
might
apply
to
some
pro
se
litigants
and
might
not
apply
to
others.
for
example,
if
there
are
pro
se
litigants
who
have
professions
and
who
do
work,
any
time--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--yes,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
we
do
not
believe--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--that's
right.
he
might
not
pursue
them
himself,
but
he
has
the
same
option
that
every
other
citizen
in
the
country
has,
as
encouraged
by
congress,
and
that
is
to
hire
an
attorney
to
represent
him
if
he
decides
that
he
should
file
a
civil
rights
claim.
congress
has
put
every
citizen
in
the
country
on
the
same
plane,
the
same
starting
point
with
its
concern
about
hiring
an
attorney
to
represent
him
if
he's
filing
a
civil
rights
action.
attorneys
certainly
have
the
capability
of
finding
attorneys
to
represent
them
if
they
wish
to
bring
these
actions
and
do
not
wish
to
spend
the
time
on
it
themselves
as
far
as
litigating
the
action.
and
we
believe--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--that
certainly
is
the
possibility.
a
congress
intent
in
enacting
the
statute
obviously
was
not
to,
to
award
fees
to
anyone
whether
or
not
prevailing.
fees
are
available
to
prevailing
parties
only,
and
that
is
true
for
anyone
that
hires
an
attorney
to
represent
him
or
her
in
these
actions.
we
believe
if
you
compare
the
wording
"attorney's
fee
as
part
of
costs.
"
with
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
"pro
se",
it
becomes
even
clearer
that
congress
was
contemplating
the
attorney-client
relationship.
pro
se
means
appearing
for
oneself,
as
in
the
case
of
one
who
does
not
retain
a
lawyer
and
appears
for
himself
in
court.
someone
who
is
appearing
pro
se
is
doing
it
for
himself
on
his
own
behalf.
someone
who
is...
who
is
qualified
for
attorneys'
fees
is
an
attorney
who
is
acting
on
behalf
of
someone
else,
his
client.
the
legislative
history
supports
this
conclusion.
congress'
main
concern
was
with
citizens
who
might
be
unable
to
assert
their
civil
rights
because
they
could
not
afford
to
hire
attorneys
to
represent
them
in
court.
congress
expressed
this
concern
in
several
places
in
the
legislative
history,
and
in
one
place
stating
that
it
was
very
concerned
about
citizens
who
must
sue
to
enforce
the
law
but
who
had
little
or
no
money
in
which
to
hire
an
attorney.
that
was
the
concern
that
congress
was
addressing
in
enacting
42
u.s.c.
section
1988.
it
very
much
wanted
to
enable
citizens
to
hire
attorneys
to
represent
them
in
these
actions.
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
does
congress
talk
about
any
intent
in
allowing
pro
se
litigants,
whether
or
not
attorneys,
to
be
awarded
attorneys'
fees
in
this
kind
of
action.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
we
don't
believe
that
it
would
make
a
difference,
if
you
mean
if
the
attorney
should
get
attorney's
fees
for
representing
clients,
we
believe
that
in
that
situation
the
attorney
would
be
eligible
for
fees.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
he
does
in
fact
represent
parties
other
than
himself
and
has
the
attorney-client
relationship
that
the
statute
contemplates.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
assuming
from
your
question
that
the
partners
were
representing
him
and
there
was
the
attorney-client
relationship,
we
believe
that
the
partners
would
be
eligible.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
we
would
agree
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
be
compensated
for
his
own
representation
of
himself.
petitioner
has
argued
that
pro
se
litigants
should
be
awarded
fees
because
organizations
are
mentioned
in
the
legislative
history,
and
that
organizations
that
proceed
pro
se
are
allowed
fees
and
so
pro
se
individuals
should
receive
fees.
we
do
not
think
that
that
argument
is
persuasive
because
organizations
do
not
in
fact
proceed
pro
se,
and
indeed
the
organizations
that
congress
specifically
mentions
in
the
legislative
history
were
all
represented
by
counsel.
they
were
all
part
of
an
attorney-client
relationship,
and
the
intent
of
the
congress
would
seem
by
the
language
that
it
used
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
it
was
still
looking
at
the
attorney-client
relationship.
organizations
indeed
are
represented
by
other
parties
as
a
general
rule,
whether
the
attorney
is
an
inhouse
counsel
or
outside
counsel,
and
certainly
that
was
true
in
all
of
the
specific
situations
that
congress
was
examining
in
determining
the
wording
of
42
u.s.c.
section
1988.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
i
don't
know
if
courts
allow
partnerships
to
proceed
pro
se
without
a
licensed
attorney
there
in
the
courtroom
for
them.
my
experience
has
been
that
there
has
always
been
a
licensed
attorney
representing
these
organizations
and
these
partnerships.
but
if
there
is
someone
who
is
not
a
licensed
attorney
representing
a
partnership,
then
we
would
say
that
there
cannot
be
an
attorney-client
relationship
because
there
is
not
even
an
attorney.
we
would...
we
would
say
that...
we
would
agree
with
petitioner
that
at
the
least
the
statutory
language
would
require
there
to
be
an
attorney
involved
in
the
representation.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes,
we
would,
if
the
lawyer
is
representing
the
partnership
and
there
is
the
attorney-client
relationship.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes.
we
believe
that
if
the
partnership
or
organization
is
greater
than
the
individual
that
is
representing
the
partnership
or
organization,
then
that
there
is
an
attorney-client
relationship,
and
that
that
is
what
the
language
and
the
intent
for
42
u.s.c.
would
require,
and
fees
would
be
applicable
and
the
individual
would
be
eligible
for
attorney's
fees
for
that
reason.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit
have
held--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--there
are
only
three
circuits
that
have
ruled
on
this
specific
question,
although
the
duncan
case
involved
a
defendant
obtaining
attorney's
fees,
and
so
the
question
is
enough
different
that
it's
difficult
to
know
if
that
court
would
also
make
the
same
ruling
for
a
plaintiff
that
was
proceeding
pro
se.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress'
intent
to
foster
private
enforcement
actions
is
in
any
way
undercut
by
the
decision
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
make
in
this
case.
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
foster
all
enforcement
actions.
if
it
had
that
intent
it
would
have
in
fact
awarded
fees
to
all
parties
that
brought
suits,
whether
or
not
the
parties
prevailed.
clearly
congress'
intent
to
encourage
enforcement
actions
was
limited
by
the
means
that
it
adopted
for
this
statute,
and
those
means
being
that
attorneys'
fees...
that
prevailing
parties
would
be
eligible
for
actorneys'
fees
if
in
fact
there
were
an
attorney-client
relationship...
an
attorney
representing
another
person,
that
attorney's
client.
we
believe
that
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
intent
are
clear
that
pro
se
litigants,
whether
or
not
they
are
attorneys,
are
ineligible
for
attorneys'
fees
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1988,
and
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit.
thank
you.
