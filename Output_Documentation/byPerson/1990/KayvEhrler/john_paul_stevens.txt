justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
in
this
case
the
presidential
candidate
had
also
put
on
the
complaint
that
he
had
also
represented
a
voter
in
kentucky
to
get
not
only
the
candidate's
point
of
view
but
the
voter's
point
of
view
for
standing.
fees
in
that
case?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
differentiate
if
there,
if
a
common
interest...
say
the
vice
presidential
candidate
was
plaintiff
also.
he
represents
x
and
y,
presidential
and
vice
presidential
candidate
respectively,
and
he
is
one
of
the
two.
does
he
get
a
fee?
justice
stevens
which
means
he
would
or
would
not
get
a
fee?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
would
it
make
any
difference
if
it
were
a
class
action
and
the
litigant
was
proceeding
on
behalf
of
a
class
and
was
the
named
plaintiff
and
also
the
lawyer?
justice
stevens
because
of
the
class
members,
yes.
justice
stevens
another
example
occurs
to
me.
i
remember
there's
the
shakman
case
in
chicago.
shakman
was
a
lawyer,
but
he
was
a
member
of
a
law
firm,
and
i
think
probably
everybody
in
the
law
firm
worked
on
the
case.
would
his
partners
be...
under
your
view
his
partners
would
be
entitled
to
a
fee
but
he
would
not?
justice
stevens
but
he
couldn't...
he
probably
couldn't
count
his
own
hours
working
on
the
case
as
part
of
the
fee?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
there.
supposing
you
had
an
attorney
who
was
a
beneficiary
of
a
trust
with
a
lot
of
money
in
it,
and
he
brought
suit
in
his
own
name
as
a
beneficiary
to
surcharge
the
trustees
for
wrongful
action
of
some
kind,
and
he
collected
a
million
dollars
or
so.
fee
or
no
fee,
do
you
suppose,
as
a
matter
of
normal
common
law
approach
to
that?
justice
stevens
he
is
both
the
beneficiary...
he
brought
an
action
on
behalf
of
all...
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say,
say
he's
the
sole
beneficiary.
i
have
to
make
him
the
sole
beneficiary.
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
thinking
of
an
action
where
he
creates...
a
common
fund
case,
where
he
creates
a
fund
for
the
trust
and
he
is
the
individual
beneficiary.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
in
most
of
those
cases
that
there
would
be...
he
in
effect
would
be
doing
a
service
for
the
trust
as
a
whole.
justice
stevens
why
would
a
pro
se
lawyer
be
any
more
apt
to
do
that
than
any
other
lawyer?
justice
stevens
they
both
have
the
same--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
lawyer
who
twiced
requested
the
kentucky
board
of
elections
to
place
his
name
on
the
democratic
party's
primary
ballot
for
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states.
when
the
board
refused
to
do
so,
he
brought
suit
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
kentucky
statute
on
which
the
board
had
relied.
he
ultimately
prevailed
and
sought
an
award
of
reasonable
attorney's
fee
pursuant
to
the
fee
shifting
provision
of
the
civil
rights
act.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
concerning
the
question
whether
a
lawyer
who
represents
himself
in
this
kind
of
litigation
maybe
be
awarded
such
a
fee.
for
reasons
stated
in
a
unanimous
opinion,
we
conclude
that
such
a
fee
award
is
not
authorized
by
the
statue
and
therefore,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
