mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
an
important
question
under
section
1988
of
the
civil
rights
laws
which
allows
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
to
prevailing
parties.
petitioner
in
this
case
is
an
attorney
who,
proceeding
pro
se
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky,
succeeded
in
having
two
state
statutes
restricting
access
to
the
ballot
declared
unconstitutional.
and
one
of
those
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
4
years
earlier
and
it
had
been
reenacted
by
the
state
in
its
identical
form
despite
the
court's
ruling.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
in
this
case?
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
he
was
a--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes.
he
was
a
candidate
for
president
of
the
united
states.
he
has
run
for
various
offices
on
the
democratic
ticket
a
number
of
times,
and
has
received
access
to
the
ballot
in
a
number
of
states
and
a
fair
amount
of
media
coverage
for
a
minor
party
candidate,
and
for
a
minor
candidate
for
the
democratic
nomination.
he,
in
doing
this,
fulfilled
the
purposes
of
the
civil
rights
laws,
and
that
is
he
acted
as
a
private
attorney
general
vindicating
not
only
his
own
rights,
representing
not
only
his
own
rights,
but
those
of
other
people
in
the
united
states.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
he
didn't
need
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar
pro
hac
vice.
he
was
not
a
regular
member
of
the
bar,
but
he
did
not
need
to
seek
a
pro
hac
vice
admission
because
under
the
rules
of
the
eastern
district
he
was
allowed
to
proceed
without
doing
that
since
he
was
pro
se.
he
is
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
states
of
florida
and
ohio.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
he
could
have...
he
could
have
proceeded
either
to
seek
admission
pro
hac
vice
or
to
proceed
under
this
rule.
it
wasn't
necessary
for
him
to
do
the
pro
hac
vice
because
the
rule
allowed
it
anyway.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
correct,
he
was
not.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
we
take
the
position
that
while
some
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute
would
be
served
by
allowing
attorneys'
fees
to
pro
se
litigants
who
are
not
attorneys,
that
the
language
of
the
statute
in
referring
to
an
attorney
assumes
a
licensed
member
of
the
bar--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i...
justice
o'connor,
i
would
agree
that
there
are
many
of
the
policies
of
this
statute
which
would
be
fulfilled
by
allowing
attorneys'
fees
to
non-attorney
pro
se
litigants.
but
there
is
the
reference
in
the
statute
to
attorney,
and
there
is
the
reference
in
the
legislative
history
wishing
to
involve
attorneys
in
these
cases.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
the
reference
is
to
the
fee
that
the
court
allows
to
the
attorney
in
the
case,
and
of
course
this
statute
comes
to
the
court
today
with
the
gloss
placed
on
it
by
both
the
blum
and
the
blanchard
cases,
which
have
specifically
held
that
this
statute
does
not
contemplate
cost-based
recovery.
in
other
words,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
under
this
statute
whether
there
is
a
paying
relationship
between
attorney
and
client.
indeed,
if
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history,
it
seems
that
one
of
the
clear
purposes
of
the
statute
was
to
award
fees
to
individuals
who
were
not
charging
their
clients
for
their
services.
so
despite
the
reference
in
the
statute
to
the
word
fee,
it
is
now
clear
under
this
court's
earlier
decision
that
the
payment
of...
an
actual
payment
of
the
fee
is
not
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
think...
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor,
because
not
only
does
the
statutory
language
not
draft
it
in
a
way
that
requires
representation,
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
relatively
easy
for
congress
to
do
that
if
it
intended
to
do
it,
but
the
policies
of
the
statute
are
fully
served
in
the
case
of
an
individual
attorney
who
is
proceeding
pro
se.
first
of
all,
the
statute
is
designed--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
realize--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
think
there
is
no
question
but
that
congress
wanted
attorneys
to
be
involved.
there
is
no
question
that
congress
to
some
extent,
to
a
significant
extent,
was
motivated
by
the
desire
to
provide
attorneys
to
people
who
could
not
afford
them.
but
it
did
not
draft
the
statute
in
that
way.
for
example,
it
could
have
said,
and
it
had
the
fair
housing
act
before
it
as
an
example
at
the
time
that
it
passed
this
statute,
it
could
have
awarded
fees
only
to
people
who
are,
quote,
"unable
to
assume
the
payment
of
the
fees
themselves.
"
it
didn't
do
that.
it
acted
more
broadly,
and
it
acted
more
broadly
because
it
had
broad
purposes
in
enacting
this
statute.
it
was
concerned
that
without
private
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights
laws,
that
the
civil
rights
laws
might
become
a
dead
letter.
it
was
actively
seeking
to
encourage
civil
rights
litigation
by
awarding
these
fees,
not
to
discourage
it.
and
again
and
again
this
court
has
said
and
the
legislative
history
has
said
that
this
was
the
central
purpose,
to
encourage
these
suits
to
be
brought
to
vindicate
the
civil
rights
not
only
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
cases,
but
of
other
people
whom
the
plaintiffs
represented.
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
lesser
purpose
to
some
extent
deter
the
defendants
in
these
cases
from
raising
defenses
to
meritorious
claims.
and
for
these...
these
purposes
are
fully
served
by
cases
in
which
an
attorney
is
proceeding
pro
se.
it
is
also
quite
clear,
we
think,
and
conceded
by
the
other
side,
by
both
the
respondent
and
by
the
united
states,
that
pro
se
organizations
proceeding
under
the
statute
are
entitled
to
recover
an
attorney's
fee.
and
i
think
the
same
purposes
of
the
statute
which
lead
to
that
result
should
lead
to
the
result
of
a
pro
se
individual
being
covered
by
the
statute
as
well.
and
if
this
court
were
to
rule
otherwise
i
think
there
would
be
extremely
difficult
line-drawing
problems.
i
mean,
you
could
have
one
case
in
which
an
individual
represented
a
corporation
or
a
nonprofit
corporation.
you
could
have
a
case
in
which
an
individual
was
a
member
of
a
voluntary
association
which
was
bringing
the
suit,
or,
as
in
some
of
the
cases,
you
could
have
an
individual
who
was
representing
a
partnership,
or
in
this
case--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
think
there
are,
there
are
in
the
examples
that
i
have
given
so
far,
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
mr.
kay
could
also
have
sued
in
the
name
of
the
kay
for
president
committee,
which
may
consist
of
one
or
two
people.
the
fact
is
that
there
may
be...
by
introducing
a
distinction
between
organizations
and
individuals,
i
think
we're
suggesting
that
some
very
difficult
line-drawing
problems
could
be
introduced,
line-drawing
which
isn't
justified
by
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
that
we
would
end
up,
as
this
court
said
in
hensley
should
not
be
the
case,
we
could
end
up
with
other
litigations
to
try
to
determine
whether
it's
an
organizational
situation
or
an
individual
situation.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
does
happen
with
some
frequency.
it
was
something
that
they
were
apparently
aware
of
in
passing
the
statute.
there
are
references
to
it
in
the
hearings,
and
there
is
a
specific
reference
to
it
in
the
house
report,
and,
that
clearly
says
that
under
those
circumstances
that
the
organization
is
entitled
to
recover
the
attorney's
fee.
and
the
amicus
brief
of
public
citizen
has
pointed
out
how
often
that
occurs
and
how
important
it
is.
and
i
understand
that
point
to
be
conceded
by
the
other
side,
that
if
it's
a
nonprofit
corporation,
if
it
has
a
corporate
form,
that
it
is
within
the
statute
and
that
an
attorney's
fee
can
be
recovered,
even
though
it
is
another
pro
se
situation.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
true
in
the
case
of
a
corporation.
but
in
the
case
of
a
voluntary
association
or
a
partnership,
which
also
qualify
for
this
organizational
status,
they
don't
have
to
proceed
by
an
attorney.
they
can
proceed
by
a
member
of
the
organization.
and
if
it
so
happens
that
they
proceed
being
represented
by
an
attorney
who
is
a
member
of
the
organization,
it
seems
difficult...
very
difficult
to
distinguish
between
that
situation
and
the
corporate
situation,
and
very
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
could
have
intended
to
do
that.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes.
there
is
one
of
the
leading
district
of
columbia
cases,
the
d.c.
circuit
cases
here,
the
cuneo
case,
involved
a
case
in
which
the
partnership
appeared
pro
se
and
mr.
cuneo
represented
them,
and
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
he
was
entitled
to
fees.
so
these
things
do
happen.
and
if,
if
the
court
tries
to
draw
a
line
between
individuals
and
organizations
i
fear
it
will
be
a
very
difficult
line
for
the
courts
to
administer
in
practice,
not
only
because
these
situations
do
exist,
but
it
would
create
an
incentive
for
people
to
create
an
organization
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
attorneys'
fees.
now
the
solicitor
general
tells
us
don't
worry,
we'll
pierce
the
corporate
veil,
we'll
go
behind
that,
but
there
again
i
think
one
is
just
getting
into
all
sorts
of
difficult
litigation
over
the
question
of
attorneys'
fees.
we
are
told...
we
are
told
by
the
other
side
that
there
are
purposes
of
the
statute
which
would
be
defeated
if
attorneys'
fees
were
allowed
here.
it
is
said,
for
example,
by
the
brief
of
the
state
of
hawaii
and
others
as
amicus
that
if
attorneys'
fees
are
allowed
here
it
will
devastate
the
state
treasuries,
and
that
for
that
reason
the
court
should
not
construe
1988
as
allowing
attorneys'
fees
in
this
situation.
the
difficulty
with
that
argument,
of
course,
is
it
will
devastate
the
state
treasuries
only,
only
if
the
petitioner
as
the
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
prevail.
and
if
they
prevail
they
are
serving
the
very
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act
that
led
congress
to
award
of
an
attorney's
fee.
they
also
argue
that
the
reason
that
congress
wanted
to
get
attorneys
involved
in
these
civil
rights
cases
was
to
perform
a
sifting
function,
that
they
would
sit
there
and
decide
which
cases
were
meritorious
and
ought
to
be
brought,
and
which
cases
were
not
meritorious
and
should
not
be
brought.
and
they
somehow
suggest
that
a
pro
se
attorney
isn't
going
to
perform
the
same
sifting
function.
the
difficulty
here
again
is
that
there
simply
isn't
a
single
statement
in
the
legislative
history
suggesting
that
congress
enacted
1988
or
brought
attorneys
into
the
process
in
order
to
perform
this
sifting
function.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the
problem,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
congress
faced
in
1976
after
this
court's
decision
in
alyeska
was
that
they
thought
these
cases
would
not
be
brought
because
they
could
not
be
brought
based
on
the
traditional
attorney-client
relationship
in
which
the
client
retained
the
attorney
and
agreed
to
pay
the
attorney.
congress
felt,
in
fact,
so
strongly
about
this
that
they
concluded
that
if
they
did
not
provide
for
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees,
that
the
civil
rights
laws
would
not
be
enforced.
and
it
is
clear,
i
think,
that
pro
se
attorneys,
individuals
proceeding
pro
se
as
attorneys,
have
made
valuable
contributions
in
this
area.
this
petitioner
did
in
this
particular
case.
the
briefs
that
we
have
filed--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
kennedy,
that
is
quite
true
that
there
are
purposes
of
this
statute
which
would
be
served
by
awarding
fees
to
individuals
who
are
not
attorneys.
and
if
i
were
to
approach
this
as
a
legislative
matter
i
would
completely
agree
that
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
that.
but
there
is
the
word
"attorney"
in
the
statute,
there
is
the
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
desire
to
bring
expert
individuals
into
this,
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
the
language
and
the
history
of
the
statute
suggests
that
it
falls
short
of
awarding
it
to
non-attorney
pro
se's,
a
result
which
has
been
reached
by
many
of
the
circuits
which
have
nonetheless
agreed
that
pro
se
attorneys
should
recover.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
think
i'm
not,
justice
scalia,
ignoring
the
word
fee.
i
think
that
based
on
this
court's
decisions
in
blum
and
blanchard
that
i
read
the
word
fee
as
referring
to
the
payment
that
is
made
to
the
prevailing
party.
and
i
approach
the
statute
with
the
understanding
from
this
court's
decisions
that
it
is...
does
not
provide
for
cost-based
recovery.
but
i
also
approach
the
statute
not
only
looking
at
the
word
attorney,
but
looking
at
the
legislative
history
which
suggests
this
desire
to
have
attorneys
involved.
there
was
an
apparent
conclusion
that
attorneys
were
invaluable
contributions
to
these
cases.
now,
a
number
of
members
of
the
court
have
suggested
that
non-attorneys
may
bring
valuable
contributions.
i
don't
dispute
that.
i
say
again
that
i
agree
that
non-attorneys
may
make
very
valuable
contributions
to
these
cases,
and
that
there
are
many
reasons
for
arguing
that
they
should
also
be
covered.
and
i
agree
that
if
you
look
at
the
words
"prevailing
party"
instead
of
attorney's
fee,
that
maybe
it
is
possible
to
reach
the
conclusion
under
this
statute
that
it
covers
non-attorneys.
that
issue
of
course
is
not
before
the
court
today.
but
we,
i...
i'm
giving
you
my
best
understanding
of
what
i
think
congress
intended,
and
i
think
that
congress
probably
did
not
intend
to
include
pro
se
non-attorneys
within
the
statute,
even
though
there
are
strong
reasons
for
doing
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
as
i
listen
to
the
united
states
and
the
respondent,
i
begin
to
hear
that
almost
everybody
other
than
an
individual
can
litigate
on
a
pro
se
basis
and
recover
under
the
statute.
i
hear
concessions
that
a
voluntary
association
could
do
that.
i
hear
the
concession,
i
think,
that
a
partnership
could
do
that.
i
even
hear
a
concession
that
an
individual
could
proceed
to
bring
a
class
action
and
recover.
and
i
find
great
difficulty
in
finding
any
distinction
between
those
people,
if
they're
allowed
to
recover
under
section
1988,
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
who
was
a
prevailing
party.
he
prevailed
mightily
in
having
these
two
statutes
declared
unconstitutional,
having
to
attack
one
of
them
for
the
second
time,
and
allowing
him
the
fee
that
the
statute
contemplates
fully
serves
the
statutory
purpose.
one
of
the
things
that
congress
was
fully
conscious
of
in
enacting
this
legislation
was
that
it
was
not
easy
to
get
people
to
take
civil
rights
cases.
it
was
not
easy
to
get
people
to
take
civil
rights
case
even
if
you
provided
for
a
statutory
attorney's
fee.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
surely
true
that
the
statutory
purpose
would
be
served
if
he
had
gotten
an
attorney
to
represent
him.
the
difficulty
is,
and
i
think
it's
reflected
in
the
history
of
this
statute
that
i
am
talking
about,
is
that
he
may
not
have
been
able
to
get
an
attorney
to
represent
him,
and
as
a
result
of
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that
is
true.
but
if,
if
the
effect
of
denying
the
fee
here
is
to
cause
this
individual
petitioner
not
to
bring
this
suit,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
defeated.
in
order
to
bring
this
suit
he
has
to
suffer
significant
opportunity
costs.
he
may
also
have
paralegal
costs,
which
under
this
court's
decision
in
missouri
and
jenkins
can
only
be
recovered
as
part
of
the
attorney's
fee.
they
are
not
recoverable
as
part
of
the
costs.
so
he
has
the
opportunity
costs,
he
has
the
potential
paralegal
costs
and
related
costs,
and
if
he
can't
recover
those
he
may
not
bring
the
suit
at
all.
i
think
it
is
not
possible
to
assume
that
every
pro
se
attorney
litigant
has
the
capability
to
go
out
and
hire
an
attorney,
that
that's
an
option
available
to
him.
i
think
in
many
cases
it
is
not
an
option
that
is
available
to
him.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
as
i
said
earlier,
i
think
there
are,
that
the
nonlawyer
civil
rights
plaintiff
who
proceeds
pro
se
can
make
a
significant
claim
that
he
is
serving
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
if
you
focus
on
the
terminology
"prevailing
party"
rather
than
on
the
word
"attorney",
maybe
one
concludes
that
the
non-attorney
pro
se
should
also
recover.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
pro
se
attorney
is
directly
serving
every
significant
purpose
that
this
statute
was
designed
for.
he
is
bringing
a
meritorious
civil
rights
case.
we
have
to
assume
that
the
case
is
meritorious,
because
there
are
no
fees
if
he
does
not
prevail.
and
indeed
there
are
disincentives
written
into
the
statute,
not
only
the
denial
of
the
fee,
but
the
possibility
that
the
defendant
would
recover
a
fee
against
the
plaintiff
if
the
action
was
unfounded.
this
pro
se
attorney
brings
to
bear
on
the
litigation
his
expertise
as
an
attorney
to
litigate
these
civil
rights
cases.
mr.
kay
in
this
particular
case
has
argued
20
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
how
many?
i
do
not
know
the
answer,
but
i
think
a
relatively
small
number
of
them.
and
by
seeking
out
these
statutes,
by
successfully
having
them
declared
unconstitutional,
by
litigating
these
issues
he
is
doing
exactly
what
congress
wanted
done,
and
that
is
that
the
civil
rights
of
people
in
this
country
are
vindicated.
not
just
mr.
kay's
rights,
but
those
of
the
people
in
general.
congress
wasn't
just
concerned
about
the
individual
litigants,
it
was
concerned
about
the
breadth
of
enforcement.
and
there
is
no
basis,
we
suggest,
for
distinguishing
between
a
situation
in
which
the
individual
is
proceeding
pro
se
and
all
these
other
situations
where
it
is
conceded
that
the
organization
or
the
class
or
the
partnership
is
proceeding
pro
se
and
would
recover
fees.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
more.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
thank
you.
