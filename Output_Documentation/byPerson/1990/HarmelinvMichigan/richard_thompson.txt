mr.
richard
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
you
consider
the
petitioner's
case,
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
potential
harm
to
society
of
the
672
grams
of
cocaine
that
the
petitioner
possessed
at
the
time
he
arrest...
he
was
arrested.
that
amount
is
equivalent
to
12,000
hits
on
the
street.
that
amount
makes
more
than
5,400
rocks
of
crack,
the
most
addictive
and
dangerous
form
of
cocaine
in
use
today.
mr.
richard
thompson
yes.
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
thompson
--well,
it
has
something
to
do--
mr.
richard
thompson
--yes,
if
that...
that
is
theoretically
possible,
but
it
has
something
to
do
about
why
the
state
legislature
used
the
650
gram
as
the
mark
off
for
mandatory
life
in
prison.
this
was
a
lot
of
cocaine,
and
the
state
legislature
recognized
the
devastating
effect
of
that
much
cocaine
when
it
introduced
this
law
and
made
this
part
of
the
law.
the
individual
culpability
of
this--
mr.
richard
thompson
--it
is
an
addictive
drug
as
far
as
its
psychological
and
physiological
effects
has
on
the
person
that
takes
crack
cocaine.
mr.
richard
thompson
no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
mr.
richard
thompson
the
law
enforcement
lab
people
who
are
experienced
in
this,
the
professionals
that
handle
this,
indicate
it
is
a
highly
addictive
drug.
a
significant
number
of
people
who
use
crack
for
the
first
time
become
addicts.
that
is
common
knowledge
in
the
law
enforcement
area.
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
indicate,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
legislative
history
is
not
really
an
official
part
of
the
legislature.
that
is
merely
a
document
that
was
prepared
by
the
staff
of
the
senate
and
the
house.
so
it
is
not
really
something
that
is
in
the
official
records
of
the
legislature.
mr.
richard
thompson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
that
was
a
legislative
inference
i
think
they
made
when
they
decided
that
cut
off,
that
650
grams.
someone
does
not
possess
that
for
personal
use.
someone
possesses
that
with
the
intent
to
deliver.
in
fact,
petitioner
admits
in
his
own
brief
that
i
am
a
mule
of
transport,
in
an
attempt
to
minimize
his
culpability.
however--
mr.
richard
thompson
--there...
it
is
a
separate
state
offense,
your
honor,
but
the
penalties
are
the
same.
mr.
richard
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
prosecutor's
office,
with
the
facts
that
we
had,
could
easily
have
charged
possession
with
intent
to
deliver.
mr.
richard
thompson
which
would
import
the
same
penalty,
life,
but
there
we
would
have
a
different
element,
an
additional
element
that
we
would
have
to
prove,
which
we
could
have
in
this
case,
but
which
we
felt
not
necessary
and
not
prudent
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
us
to
win
a
prosecution.
mr.
richard
thompson
that
would
be
a
lesser
penalty
on
that,
your
honor.
it
would
be
mandatory
20
years
to
a
maximum
of
30
years.
mr.
richard
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
again,
going
back
to
the
inference--
mr.
richard
thompson
--the
legislature
just
developed
two
laws.
the
inference
is
the
same.
if
you
have
650
grams
of
cocaine,
then
that
is
not
for
your
personal
consumption.
that
is
an
indication
to
the
legislature
that
this
was
going
to
be
for
transport,
for
delivery.
and
in
fact
in
this
case
the
defendant
admits
in
the
petition
that
i
was
merely
a
mule.
now--
mr.
richard
thompson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
i
think
that,
not
trying
to
read
what
the
legislature
was
thinking
when
they
did
that,
there
is
no
difference
as
far
as
the
penalty
goes.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
legislature
was
identifying,
as
you
indicated,
people
who
have
that
much
cocaine
on
their
possession
do...
are
going
to
be
involved
in
the
trade.
it
is
not
for
personal
consumption.
mr.
richard
thompson
no,
your
honor.
they
have
had
these,
those
kinds
of
crimes
for
a
long
time.
however,
back
in
1977
the
legislature
started
to
hold
hearings,
public
hearings
across
the
state
trying
to
address
the
problem
of
drugs.
and
they
listened
to
the
community.
mr.
richard
thompson
it
was
a
part
of
the
same
act.
however,
as
you
go
down
further,
when
you
get
below
50
grams,
then
the
penalties
do
change.
where
if
you
have
possession
of
less
than
50,
50
grams,
you
have
a
4-year
possibility
of
sentence,
but
if
you
possess
with
intent
to
deliver,
then
the
penalty
is
more.
but
at
the
top
level--
mr.
richard
thompson
--no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor.
merely
having
that
suitcase
in
your
closet
does
not
fulfill
the
requirements
of
possession.
the
person
must
know
the
nature
of
the
contents,
must
have
that
knowledge
plus
the
intent
to
establish
some
control,
whether
it
be
constructive
or...
true
control
over
the--
mr.
richard
thompson
--your
honor,
if
we
had...
if
the
prosecutor
had
that
kind
of
information,
there
is
that
prosecutorial
discretion
that
could
be
exercised
in
deciding
whether
you
are
going
to
charge
the
grandmother
or
whether
you
are
going
to
use
the
grandmother
to
testify
against
the--
mr.
richard
thompson
--i
can't
give
a
definite
yes
or
no
on
that,
your
honor,
because
i
can
see
circumstances
where--
mr.
richard
thompson
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
there
are
checks
and
balances.
even...
once
that,
once
the
warrant
is
issued,
your
honor,
if
the
prosecutor
wants
to
make
an
agreement
of
some
kind
with
the
defendant
in
this
level
of
drug
dealing,
the
prosecutor
must
get
permission
from
the
court.
because
what
the
legislature--
mr.
richard
thompson
there...
we'll
always
have...
if
i
understand
your
question
or
your
statement,
we
always
have
discretion
in
the
system
someplace.
sometimes
it's
with
the
prosecutor
and
sometimes
it's
with
the
court.
in
this
particular
case
the
legislature
said--
mr.
richard
thompson
--we
are
going
to
eliminate
that
discretion
from
the
court.
mr.
richard
thompson
well,
the
prosecutor
has,
the
prosecutor
must
enforce
the
law.
mr.
richard
thompson
and
in
michigan
if
there
is--
mr.
richard
thompson
--the
prosecutor
does
not
ignore
it,
your
honor.
the
prosecutor
has
discretion,
as
it
has
in
any
law
that
it,
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
enforce.
mr.
richard
thompson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
in
my
view
it
is,
your
honor.
what
we
have
here
is
the
democratically
elected
representatives
of
the
people
saying...
expressing
a
societal
interest
in
deterring
this
crime
and
permanently
removing
people
from
society
who
participate
in
this
crime.
and
if
we
have
a--
mr.
richard
thompson
--yes,
your
honor.
deterrence,
both
general
and
individual.
deterrence
to
prevent
other
people
from
getting
involved,
and
deterrence
to
keep
this
person
from
getting
back
out
on
the
street
to
purvey
his
drugs
again.
mr.
richard
thompson
the...
we
have
in
prison
right
now
123
individuals
charged
and
convicted
under
this
act,
your
honor.
those
people
will
never
deal
their
drugs
again.
and
contrary--
mr.
richard
thompson
--your
honor,
it
would
be
merely
speculation
on
my
part.
i
know
that
the
law--
mr.
richard
thompson
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
again,
it
would
be
speculation
on
my
part.
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
the
defendant,
by
the
way,
was
given
an
opportunity
to
address
the
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
and
did
not
address
the
court.
the
defense
counsel
was
given
an
opportunity
to
address
the
court
at
time
of
sentencing,
and
the
defense
counsel
said
i
have
read
the
presentence
report
and
it
is
accurate.
he
didn't
deny--
mr.
richard
thompson
--well,
i
was
responding
to
the
question
of
what
is
in--
mr.
richard
thompson
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
it
was
at
the
appeals
level,
the
first
appeal...
the
court
of
appeals.
at
the
point,
at
the
trial--
mr.
richard
thompson
--it
was
a
trial
by
a
judge,
and
the
only
questions
there
were
search-and-seizure
questions.
those
were
resolved
in
the
prosecutor's
favor,
and
we
had
a
1-day
trial.
mr.
richard
thompson
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
getting
to
the
petitioner's
culpability
in
this
case,
which
i
think
is
important,
not
only
did
he
have
a
pound
and
a
half
of
cocaine
on
his
person,
pure
cocaine,
by
the
way,
not
mixed,
he
had
on
his
person
also
$3,500
in
cash,
a
sifter,
which
is
commonly
used
to
crush
cocaine
to
dilute
it
with
other
material,
other
narcotics.
he
has
on
his
person
a
beeper,
a
pager.
he
had
on
his
person
a
coded
address
book.
he
had
on
his
person
a.38
caliber
pistol
strapped
to
his
ankle.
this
was
a
person
that
just
did
not
happen
to
come
upon
a
pound
and
a
half
of
cocaine.
this
was
an
individual
that
was
deeply
involved
in
the
drug
trade.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
he
was,
it
was
at
5:10
a.m.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
but
even
before
then
police
observed
him
going
in
and
out
of
the
motel
area
between
2:45
a.m.
and
5:00
a.m.
in
a
highly...
in
a
high
drug
trafficking
area.
mr.
richard
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
the
michigan
legislature
could
do
that.
the
michigan
supreme
court
can
do
that.
they
have
done
it
before
when
a
law
has
become
more
lenient
from
the
time
that
the
person
was
convicted
of
the
crime.
but,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
an
important
point--
mr.
richard
thompson
--your
honor,
the
michigan
legislature
has
twice
visited
this
law
since
it
was
adopted
in
1978.
back
in
1987
they
amended
some
of
the
penalties
below
the
650
level
and
reduced
them
by
half.
a
year
later
they
revisited
again
and
raised
those
penalties
back
up,
because
they
said
that
the
law
stopped
to
have
the
deterrent
effect.
and
that
is
what
is
important
about
this.
mr.
richard
thompson
i
don't
know.
we're
always
having
elections
in
michigan,
your
honor.
but
that
is
an
important
part.
they
are
representing
the
will
and
the
societal
interest
in
this,
in
this
area.
and
i
think
this
court,
through
its
stated
concerns
about
separation
of
powers
and
federalism
and
judicial
restraint,
ought
to
leave
this
case
where
it
is,
in
the
hands
of
the
legislature,
who
are
preeminently
involved
with
the
line
drawing
schemes
when
you
are
dealing
with
crimes
and
the
punishments
for
those
crimes.
now,
petitioner
says
i
am
not
a
drug
kingpin.
now,
i
don't
know
what
a
drug
kingpin
is,
because
it
is
not
defined
in
the
michigan
statute.
but
assuming
it
is
someone
that
has
a
lot
of
drugs,
what,
what
is
the
level
that
we
have
to
decide
that
makes
a
drug
kingpin?
we
do
know
he
was
involved
in
a
lot
of
drugs.
this
statute,
i
submit
respectfully
to
the
court,
was
anchored
in
the
practicalities
of
the
drug
distribution
network.
we
realize
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
drugs
you
have
got
the
street
level
dealer
that
has
to
depend
on
a
large
supplier
to
get
the
drugs,
and
you
have
the
large
supplier
that
needs
to
depend
on
the
street
level
dealer
to
get
the
drugs.
what
we
were
focussing
in
on
was
the
entire
drug
distribution
network,
not
the
man
at
the
top,
because
we
realize
the
man
at
the
top
doesn't
even
get
close
to
the
drugs.
and
if
we
had
this
statute
focused
in
on
the
kingpin,
it
would
have
been
doomed
to
failure
from
the
start.
but
what
we
do
have
is
a
focus
on
the
entire
distribution
network.
and
contrary
to
petitioner's
position,
it
has
had
a
dramatic
impact
on
the
drug
distribution
problem
that
we
have
in
michigan.
before
this
act
when
someone
got
caught
they
had
a
very
lenient
sentence.
they
would
serve
their
time,
they
would
go
right
back
out
on
the
streets
and
commit
their
acts
again.
it
was
merely
a
cost
of
doing
business.
now
when
we
catch
someone
under
this
act,
the
first
thing
they
do
is
talk
to
the
prosecutor
about
making
a
deal,
wanting
to
turn
the
bigger
man
in.
contrary
to
what
the
petitioner
says,
this
has
had
an
impact
on
us
getting
the
drug
kingpin,
because
this
statute
was
anchored
on
the
practicalities
of
the
drug
distribution
network
in
the
state
of
michigan.
mr.
richard
thompson
i
have--
mr.
richard
thompson
--not
a
part
of
the
record,
your
honor,
but
the
michigan
state
police
in
their
annual
report
indicated
that
it
does
have
a
deterrent--
mr.
richard
thompson
--okay.
well,
i
don't
have
anything
in
the
record
itself,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
that
is
correct.
but
as
it
was
observed
before,
we
don't
know
how
high
it
would
have
been
without
the
statute.
and
that
is
where
you
get
into
those--
mr.
richard
thompson
--not
regarding
the
impact
of
a
particular
statute--
mr.
richard
thompson
--with
the
entire
drug
distribution
sea
out
there.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
thompson
we
don't,
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
develop
a
scientific
study
about
that.
mr.
richard
thompson
because
the
purpose...
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
deterrence.
and
the
state
legislature
has
indicated
that,
and
when
they
reduced
the
charge
they
brought
it
back
up,
the
penalties,
they
brought
it
back
up
because
the
state
legislature
said
that
we
weren't
getting
deterrence
out
of
the
more
lenient
sentences.
mr.
richard
thompson
your
honor,
i
think
the
test
that
this
court
has
enunciated
in
solem
is
whether
there
is
gross
disproportionality
involved.
and
a
lot
has
been
said
about
what
other
states
do
as
far
as
the
drug
laws
go.
mr.
richard
thompson
not
as
tough,
your
honor.
not...
we
have,
and
i
will
admit
we
have
the
toughest
penalties,
but
this
court
has
said
that
merely
because
a
state
has
the
toughest
penalty
in
any
area
does
not
mean
it
is
grossly
disproportionate.
because
under
our
federal
system
there
will
always
be
a
state
that
has
the
distinction
of
having
the
severest
penalty
in
some
offense.
that's
the
beauty
of
the
federal
system.
that
people
can
look
to
the
state
of
michigan
and
see
what
michigan's
experience
is
with
the
drug
laws.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said
in
his
brief,
that
states
are
starting
to
follow
michigan's
lead,
that
they
are
making
stricter
penalties
in
the
drug
area.
that
in
fact
the
federal
government
in
the
last
10
years
has
amended
its
controlled
substance
act
3
times,
and
each
time
it
has
made
the
penalties
tougher.
now,
petitioner
doesn't
say
it's
unconstitutional
to
create
a
crime
such
as
we
have
created,
and
petitioner
admits
that
this
crime
is
a
grave
one,
admits
it
in
the
brief.
the
only
question
that
petitioner
has
is
has
the
state-mandated
law
gone
so
high
as
to
make
it
constitutionally
impermissible?
now,
what
that
issue
does
is
thrust
this
court
into
the
line-drawing
process
which
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
is
preeminently...
belongs
to
the
legislative
branch
of
government.
there's
no
question
about
it,
