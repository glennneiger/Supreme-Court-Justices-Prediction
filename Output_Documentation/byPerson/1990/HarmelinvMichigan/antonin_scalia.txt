justice
scalia
--maybe
michigan
has
a
bigger
problem
with
drugs
than
oregon
and
most
of
the
other
states
do.
isn't,
isn't
a
state
entitled
to
feel
more
deeply
about
some
crimes
than
other
states
do?
justice
scalia
and
it's
a
problem
that
causes
the
loss
of
human
life.
not
just
the
people
that
use
the
drugs,
but
the
people
who
buy
and
sell
it
kill
one
another
and
innocent
by-standers.
why
can't
michigan
feel
very
strongly
about
that
and
say...
and
say
by
george,
we're
going
to
put
a
stop
to
it?
we
don't
care
whether
other
states
want
to
ride
along
with
it.
we're
going
to
impose
a
severe
penalty
so
that
no
one
will
use
drugs.
we
can't
impose
capital
punishment,
but
we'll
put
them
to
prison
for
life.
why
is
that
wrong?
justice
scalia
most
unlikely.
you're
not
willing
to
concede
that
having
that
much
is
very
good
indication
that
it's
not
being
held
for
personal
consumption
but
for
distribution?
justice
scalia
of
an
awfully
large
quantity
of--
justice
scalia
it's
only
about
a
decade
or
so
ago
that
we
found
in
the
constitution
a
prohibition
on
imposing
capital
punishment
for
anything
except
the
killing
of
a
human
being,
and
now
you
say
that
we
also
can't
impose
life...
it
is
also
unconstitutional
to
impose
life
imprisonment
for
anything
except
the
taking
of
a
human
life.
i
sense
a
certain
ratchet
effect
here.
justice
scalia
what,
what
about
30
years
to
a
50
year
old,
or
to
a
60
year
old?
does
that
amount
to
life
imprisonment?
justice
scalia
well,
what
do
you,
what
do
you
do
about
someone
who
is
not
likely
to
live
35
years,
and
he
gets
a
mandatory
35
years
under
a
statute?
he's
a...
he
is
60
years
old
when
he
is
convicted.
is...
does
that
come
within
your
prohibition?
you
can
only
give
that
sentence
to
someone
who
has
taken
a
human
life?
justice
scalia
well,
i
am
just,
you
know,
testing
what
you're...
you're
asking
us
to
create
a
new
constitutional
rule
that
i
have
not
heard
of
before.
what
is...
what's
the
criterion
for
it?
justice
scalia
but
we
could
say
in
the
death
penalty
cases,
as
we
have
many
times,
that
death
is
different.
you
really
can't
say
that
life
imprisonment
is
different.
life
imprisonment
for
a
20
year
old
is
no
different
from
a
20
year
sentence
for
a
70
year
old.
justice
scalia
how
can
we
say
that...
i
mean,
if
the
criterion
is
whether
you
will
die
in
prison,
a
mandatory
life
sentence
is
no
different
from
a
mandatory
term
of
years,
depending
upon
the
age
of
the
person
convicted.
justice
scalia
no,
i'm
positing
a
mandatory
term
of
years
without
any
good
time,
without
anything
else.
just
20
years.
you
do
20.
justice
scalia
that's...
is
that
different
too?
does
that
come
within
your
prescription,
depending
upon
how
old
the
person
condemned
is?
justice
scalia
well,
that
may
be
the
case
in
michigan.
it's
not
the
case
in
my
hypothetical.
and
how
do
you
answer
my
hypothetical?
why
is...
you
know,
we
say
death
is
different,
and
you
tell
us
that
life
imprisonment
is
different.
but
life
imprisonment
isn't
different
from
a
flat
term
of
years
for
an
elderly
person,
is
it?
it's
not
different
from
a
very
rare
occasional
hypothetical,
no.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
that's
your
answer?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
apparently
the
michigan
legislature
thought
differently.
i
mean,
that's
a
good
argument.
it
may
well
be
correct,
but
i
assume
it
was
made
to
the
michigan
legislature
when
they
passed
this
law.
justice
scalia
which
would...
which
would
import
the
same
penalty,
life.
justice
scalia
how
did
these
two
statutes
come
to
be?
was
the
old...
is
the
intent
to
distribute
statute
an
older
one
and
this
possession
statute
was
simply
added
to
it?
justice
scalia
and
you
say
that
they
enacted
simultaneously
two
statutes,
one
of
which
says
you
get
life
for
possessing
650
grams
with
intent
to
distribute,
and
in
addition,
at
the
same
time,
the
same
legislature
drafted
another
statute
that
said
you
get
650
for
possessing
650...
or
you
get--
justice
scalia
mr.
thompson,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
governor
can
grant
clemency
to
this...
i
gather
you
agree
that
the
governor
could--
justice
scalia
--grant
clemency
if
he
wishes.
i
assume
the
michigan
legislature,
if
it,
if
it
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
stupid
law
and
is
in
fact
not
deterring,
as
counsel
asserts
it
is
not,
i
assume
they
could
repeal
the
law
and
could
retroactively
reduce
the
sentence?
could
the
michigan
legislature
do
that,
or
is
it
writ
in
stone?
justice
scalia
so,
so
we,
we
could
wait
several
years
to
see
if
the
michigan
legislature
really
believes
this
things
works,
and
if
it
doesn't
they
might
well
repeal
it
and
reduce
the
sentences
meted
out
under
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan.
petitioner,
harmelin,
was
convicted
under
michigan
law
of
possessing
more
than
650
grams
of
cocaine.
he
was
sentenced
to
the
mandatory
penalty
that
michigan
provides
for
that
offense,
which
is
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole.
the
state
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
conviction
rejecting
harmelin's
argument
that
the
sentence
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
amendment.
we
affirm
that
judgment.
part
5
of
my
opinion,
which
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
o'connor,
kennedy,
and
souter,
rejects
the
claim
that
a
mandatory
sentence
is
always
cruel
and
unusual
because
it
prevents
the
sentencer
from
taking
into
account
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
of
the
criminal.
that
claim
has
no
support
in
the
text
of
the
eighth
amendment.
mandatory
sentences
may
or
may
not
be
cruel
but
they
are
certainly
not
unusual
having
been
common
when
the
eighth
amendment
was
adapted
and
having
remained
common
since
then.
in
a
case
called
woodson
versus
north
carolina,
we
held
that
mandatory
death
penalties
violate
the
eight
amendment,
but
we
regard
that
case
as
part
of
our
distinctive
death
penalty
jurisprudence
which
is
not
extendable
to
other
penalties.
parts
1
to
4
of
my
opinion,
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
reject
the
claim,
that
the
sentence
here
violated
the
eighth
amendment
because
it
was
significantly
disproportionate
to
the
crime.
in
our
view,
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
prohibited
by
the
eighth
amendment
are
those
which
are
in
their
nature,
and
not
just
in
relation
to
the
offense,
both
contrary
to
the
custom
and
cruel
such
as
maiming,
disemboweling,
and
other
cruel
practices
that
have
existed
in
other
times
and
places.
but
if
the
punishment
is
not
inherently
of
this
nature,
if
it
is
the
sort
of
punishment
that
our
society
has
traditionally
accepted,
it
maybe
very
undesirable
with
respect
to
a
particular
crime
that
is
a
matter
for
legislatures
to
decide,
but
it
does
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
contain
a
proportionality
principle.
the
english
declaration
of
rights
of
1689
on
which
it
was
patterned,
did
not
do
so,
some
states'
bill
of
rights
both
before
and
after
the
federal
bill
of
rights
was
drafted
and
adapted
specifically
included
a
proportionality
requirement
in
addition
to
a
cruel
and
unusual
prohibition.
the
federal
bill
of
rights
of
course
did
not.
the
first
federal
criminal
laws
adapted
by
the
very
first
congress
that
drafted
and
proposed
the
eighth
amendment,
contained
some
penalties
that
could
surely
be
considered
disproportionate.
for
example,
the
death
penalty
for
forging
a
federal
note,
whereas,
maiming
another
human
being
was
punished
with
only
seven
years
imprisonment.
throughout
the
19th
century,
neither
the
eighth
amendment
nor
any
of
the
similar
state
provisions
was
held
to
require
proportionality
and
that
proposition
was
often
rejected
by
the
courts.
not
until
the
1960s
did
the
lower
federal
courts
begin
to
impose
such
a
requirement
through
the
eighth
amendment.
this
court
approved
a
proportionality
requirement
in
capital
cases
in
1977
as
part
of
our
death
penalty
jurisprudence.
we
extended
it
to
prison
sentences
in
1983
in
a
case
called
solem
versus
helm.
besides
the
fact
that
a
proportionality
principle
is
historically
untrue,
it
does
not
lend
itself
to
the
application
of
objective
standards.
as
widely
varying
views
over
time,
and
indeed
on
this
court
today,
may
clear.
solem
versus
helm
was,
in
our
view,
wrongly
decided
and
should
be
overruled.
