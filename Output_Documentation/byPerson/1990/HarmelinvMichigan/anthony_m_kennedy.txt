justice
kennedy
you
see
no
conflict
in
the
reasoning
of
the
cases?
i
must
submit
i
think
the
cases
are
difficult
to
square,
so
far
as
their
approach
and
their
reasoning
are
concerned.
justice
kennedy
for
anything?
justice
kennedy
you
can
imagine
no
crime...
how
about
first
degree
murder?
justice
kennedy
no,
no.
suppose
you
have
a,
suppose
you
have
a
state
which
doesn't
have
a
death
penalty?
justice
kennedy
well,
do
you
have
a
problem
with
it?
justice
kennedy
so
that
there
are
some
statutes...
some
crimes
that
in
your
view
can
constitutionally
be
punished
with
a
mandatory
life
sentence?
justice
kennedy
all
right,
so...
that's
all?
justice
kennedy
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
taking
of
a
human
life
is
constitutionally
different,
and
that
society
could
not
agree
on
any
other
crime
that
was
so
close
to
that
that
mandatory
life
in
prison
is
correct,
and
i,
as
with
some
of
my
colleagues,
don't
understand
the
principle
for
that.
is
it...
you
say
it's
because
it's
universal
acceptance,
or
universal
condemnation?
i
am
not
sure
that
all
of
society
doesn't
take
some
crimes
and
elevate
them
to
the
status
of
intentional
killing:
child
molestation
of
a
young
child,
kidnapping.
we
have
to
write
the
opinion,
so
we
need
to
know
what
standard
it
is
that
we
are
supposed
to
use
in
order
to
adopt
your
view.
justice
kennedy
well,
we
write...
it's
just
the
difference
between...
i've
just
pointed
out
that
if
you,
if
you
say
that
this
is
based
on
some
societal
consensus,
i
have
no
evidence
that
that
consensus
exists.
justice
kennedy
--so
deterrence
is
not
a
reason
for
sentencing?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
there
is,
if
there
is
a
mule
ready
to
take
their
place
every
time
someone
is
put
in
prison,
then
isn't
it
a
plausible
answer
that
more
deterrence
is
needed?
if
the
price...
if
the
profits
from
doing
business
in
cocaine
are
so
tremendously
high
that
people
would
take
these
risks,
doesn't
it
follow
from
that
that
a
severe
sentence
must
be
required?
justice
kennedy
and
would
that
be...
would
that
be
exercising
the
interest
of
justice?
justice
kennedy
discretion
by
the
prosecutor
would
be
exercised
in
some
cases
in
the
interest
of
justice.
justice
kennedy
so
that
this
statutory
scheme
does
permit
an
exception
in
the
occasional
case
in
the
interest
of
justice
by
the
prosecutor,
but
not
by
the
judge?
justice
kennedy
--so,
the
point
is
you
think
this
is
an
element
in
defending
the
statute,
that
there
is
a
grounds
in
some
cases
not
to
impose
the
full
sentence.
but
that's
exactly
what
the
petitioner
is
saying
ought
to
be
the
case
and
that
you
are
resisting.
justice
kennedy
but
then--
justice
kennedy
is
there
any
evidence
that
all
of
them
knew
of
this
sentence,
of
this
law?
justice
kennedy
and
in
this
case,
any
evidence
that
this
petitioner
knew
of
the
law?
