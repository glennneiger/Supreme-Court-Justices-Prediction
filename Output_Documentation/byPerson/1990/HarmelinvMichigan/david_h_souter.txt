justice
souter
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
principle
on
which
you
are
distinguishing
mandatory
life
in
a
homicide
case
from
mandatory
life
in
a
nonhomicide
case.
what
is
the
principle?
justice
souter
yes,
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
mandatory
life
imprisonment.
why...
why
do
you
draw
the
line
where
you
do
on
this
penalty?
justice
souter
what
about--
--so
in
effect
you
are
saying
we
must
regard
it
as
the
equivalent
of
a
death
sentence?
is
that
what
your
argument
hinges
on?
justice
souter
well,
what
if...
what
if
we
don't
accept
that?
what
do
you
have
left?
justice
souter
--given
the
fact
that
the
650
grams
could
be
diluted
down,
as
justice
stevens
said,
isn't
the
real
point
of
the
650-point
cut
off
not
so
much
to
identify
the
seriousness
of
the
specific
offense,
because
he
could
be
selling
the...
the
person
possessing
could
be
possessing
something
greatly
diluted.
isn't
the
point
of
it
really
to,
as
kind
of
a
surrogate
way
of
identifying
a
distributor?
in
other
words,
isn't
the
statute
really
saying
regardless
of
what
the
dilution
may
be,
anybody
who
possesses
this
quantity
of
a
substance
must
be
possessing
it
for
something
other
than
personal
consumption?
isn't
that
the
real
point?
justice
souter
could
you
have
proved
it
with
a
lesser
quantity?
let's
say
for
example
you
had
500
with
intent
to
distribute.
what
would
the
penalty
have
been
there?
justice
souter
but
if
we're
dealing
with
650
the
penalty
is
the
same
whether
it
is
mere
possession
or
possession
with
intent
to
distribute?
justice
souter
what's
the
basis
for
the
distinction
then?
justice
souter
but
let,
let
me
go
back
to
my
example.
does
the
michigan
law
read
that
if
he
possesses
650
with
intent
to
distribute,
it
is
life
without
parole,
and
if
he
possesses
650,
period,
it
is
life
without
parole?
justice
souter
well,
that
pretty
much
destroys
the
suggestion
i
made
a
moment
ago,
doesn't
it,
that
the
real
point
of
the
law
was
to
identify
these
people?
because
the,
the
law
seems
to
be
drawing
a
distinction
that
does
not,
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
distinction
that
i
was
making.
justice
souter
was
it
at
the
sentencing
hearing
that
the
eighth
amendment
issue
was
raised?
justice
souter
when
was
that
raised?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
at
any
point
was
a
request
made
to
supplement
the
record
with
evidence
that
might
be
relevant
to
the
eighth
amendment
issue
beyond
what
was
already
in
the
record?
