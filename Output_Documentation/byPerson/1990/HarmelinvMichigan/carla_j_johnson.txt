ms.
carla
j.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
most
severe
penalty,
short
of
death,
coupled
with
a
total
lack
of
discretion
at
any
critical
stage
in
the
sentencing
process.
the
petitioner,
ronald
harmelin,
was
convicted
of
possession
of
over
650
grams
of
cocaine
in
michigan.
he
was
sentenced
to
mandatory
life
in
prison
with
no
chance
of
parole
ever.
the
question
is
whether
this
is
cruel
and
unusual
under
the
eighth
amendment.
before
we
go
any
further
let
me
make
one
thing
perfectly
clear.
mr.
harmelin
is
not
eligible
for
parole
ever.
under
this
statute
he
will
not
see
the
parole
board.
the
notion
that
a
well-behaved
lifer,
who
is
punished
by
life
in
prison,
will
not
actually
serve
life
is
wrong.
he
will
serve
life
in
prison
with
no
chance
of
parole.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
every
state
in
the
nation
has
commutation
by
the
governor
for
any
crime,
whether
it
be
a
mass
murderer
or
a
serial
rapist.
but--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--it
is...
it
is...
it
has
never
been
used
in
a
drug
offender
scenario
by
our
governor.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
it
has
been
used
very
infrequently
in
michigan.
however,
this
court
in
solem
v.
helm
has
said
that
the
mere
ad
hoc
chance
of
executive
clemency
is
not
enough
to
preclude
eighth
amendment
review,
because
if
it
was
the
eighth
amendment
review
would
be
meaningless.
our
governor
does
not
have
a
history
of
pardoning
people,
however.
seven
years
ago,
this
court
in
solem
v.
helm
fashioned
a
proportionality
test
to
determine
whether
a
sentence
is
proportional
to
the
crime.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
treat
stare
decisis
too
cavalierly.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
i
don't
think
that
solem
v.
helm
reversed
or
even
narrowed
rummel.
i
think
the
facts
in
rummel,
who
was
eligible
for
parole
and
was
going
to
be
paroled
within
10
or
12
years,
was
the
whole
difference.
we're
talking
about
a
case
where
a
person
is
in
mandatory...
with
mandatory
life
with
no
parole
ever.
that
is
a
whole
different
thing
than
somebody
that
serves
a
life
sentence
and
is
eligible
after
10
years.
i
think--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--well,
the
majority
in
solem
v.
helm
said
that
there
was
no
conflict.
they
said
that
the
difference
was
that
in
solem
v.
helm
the
person
was...
mr.
helm
was
sentenced
to
mandatory
life
with
no
parole,
which
is
different
in
kind
than
a
sentence
of
life
where
you
can
be
paroled.
and
in
rummel
v.
estelle
this
court,
even
the
minority
in
rummel
v.
helm...
or,
no,
the...
in
rummel
v.
helm
the
majority
of
this
court
said
that
a
ticket,
a
parking
ticket...
if
someone
was
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
for
a
parking
ticket,
that
would
be
disproportionate.
so
i
don't
think
that...
if
you
were
to
reverse
solem
v.
helm,
i
don't
think
you
would
necessarily
have
to
throw
out
the
whole
proportionality
test.
but
going
back
to
the
test,
the
three
factors
that
were
used
are
the
harshness
of
the
penalty,
the
gravity
of
the
offense,
what
other
states
do
with
your
crime
and
what
your
state
does
with
other
crimes.
taking
those
in
reverse
order,
michigan
is
way
out
of
line
with
every
other
state
in
the
union.
it
is
way
out
of
line
with
what
the
federal
statutes
are.
as
far
as
the
other
states,
the
majority
of
the
states
have
sentences
for
possession
of
650
grams
somewhere
between
0
and
10
years,
and
all
of
the
states
have
discretion
somewhere
to
factor
in
the
mitigating
factors,
whether
the
person
is
a
first
time
offender,
whether
he
is
a
minor
participant,
whether
there
is
some
sort
of
violence
or
not,
whether
the
person
is
a
drug
addict.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
there
is
some
sort
of
discretion.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
yes.
i
think
states
certainly
can
create
laws
trying
to
solve
problems,
and
michigan
does
have
a
big
drug
problem,
as
do
california
and
d.c.,
some
other
states
who...
that
don't
have
those--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--there
are
a
couple
answers
to
that.
one
is
that
a
state
can
propose
legislation,
but
it
still
has
to
pass
constitutional
muster.
in
this
war
on
drugs
we
have
to
fight
it
with
constitutional
weapons.
and
if
a
state
is
going
to
legislate
against
drugs,
they
should...
they
should
keep
it
within
some
sort
of
rational
basis.
this
legislation
has
the
ability
to
sentence
to
life
people
who
are
major
traffickers,
people
who
are
mules,
aiders,
and
abetters,
minor
participants,
or
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
somebody
who
would
merely
possess
the
650.
that
is
not
out
of
the
question.
oakland
county
is
the
richest
county.
so
what
my--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--the
state
didn't
prove
anything,
so
my
position
is
that
my
client
has
been
convicted
of
mere
possession.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
i
don't
know
if
it's
an
awfully
large
quantity.
in
the
federal
system
in
order
to
be
a
kingpin
under
the
criminal...
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
a
person
has
to
have
five
people
working
under
him,
he
has
to
distribute
150
kilos
of
cocaine
in
a
year,
or
make
$10
million,
and
have
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
going.
so--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--that
would
be...
in
the
scheme
of
things,
i
am
not
sure...
i
am
sorry.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
that
is
correct.
the
presentence
report
did
say
that,
and
the
reason
it
said
it
is
because
michigan
defines
a
large-scale
drug
trafficker
as
someone
who
possesses
over
650.
so
who
is
the
oakpark
police
or
the
michigan
state
police
to
argue
with
that?
this
presentence--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--i
would...
if...
if
there
were
a
sentencing
hearing
on
this
i
would
object
to
that
language.
since
there
was--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--i
think
you
have
to
take
as
a
fact
that
that
was
in
the
presentence
report,
but
i
think
you
have
to
take
it...
you
have
to
realize
also
that
because
michigan
doesn't
make
any...
any
difference
between
a
major
or
a
minor
trafficker...
anybody
with
650
gets
life
in
prison...
it
discourages
advocacy
at
the
sentencing
proceeding.
so
something
that
would
have
been
objected
to
by
counsel
was
not.
so--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--i
guess
we
don't
know
that,
and
that's
the
whole
point.
you
can...
you
can
infer
that
some
things
would
not
be
objected
to
if
it
didn't
make
any
reason
to
object
to
them.
i
don't
think
you
can...
you
don't
have
any
facts
in
front
of
you
on
this
case...
the
facts
are
pretty
bare.
but
the
fact
that
michigan
defines
a
person
who
is
possessing
650
as
a
major
trafficker,
then
no
one
argues
with
that.
there
is
no
reason.
it
discourages
advocacy
at
the
sentencing
level.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
that
is
correct.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
that's
my
point
exactly.
since
it
is
a
mandatory
sentence,
nobody
objected
to
the
presentence
report.
nobody
said
whether
he
was
a
major
trafficker
or
not,
because
it
didn't
matter.
whether
he
was
a
major
trafficker,
or
whether
he
had
it
for
his
own
possession,
or
whether
he
was
a
minor
participant
carrying
the
package
across
the
street
for
somebody
who
owned
the
package,
you
still
get
the
same
sentence.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
and
my
position
is
that
the
presentence
report
is
inaccurate.
but,
whether
it
is
accurate
or
not,
my
position
is
that
the
very
statute
on
its
face,
because
it
is
so
broad,
because
it
is
possible
to
sentence
people
who
are
traffickers,
people
who
are
mules,
people
who
are
minor
participants,
or
possessors--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--well,
there
are
some,
there
are
some
problems
with
the
over-breadth
of
the
statute
and
some
presumptions
in
this
statute
as
well.
but
this...
this
definitely
would
be
cruel--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--that
would
be
a
closer
question.
however,
i
don't
believe
that
mandatory
life--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--i
don't
believe
that
in
nondeath
cases
mandatory
life
in
prison
is
a
constitutional
sentence.
i
think
that--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--for
anything.
i
think
that--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--well,
that's
a
non...
that's
a
death
case.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
well,
i
am
sorry.
my
definition
of
a
death...
of
a
nondeath
case,
i
am
talking
about...
in
michigan
we
have
a
first
degree
murder
statute
where
we
do
get
mandatory
life
in
prison,
and
there
is
no
groundswell
of
judges
who
are
having
a
problem
with
that.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
no,
i
do
not
have
a
problem--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--yes.
the
intentional
taking
of
a
human
life.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
in
my
view.
in
michigan's
view
as
well,
other
than
this
650
statute,
first
degree
murder
and
felony
murder
are
punished
with
mandatory
life
in
prison
with
no
parole.
but
those
statutes
by
their
very
nature,
the
very
elements
of
the
crime
narrow
the
class
of
people
who
can
be
punished
by
the
elements
of
the
crime.
you
have
to
have
premeditation,
deliberation,
you
have
to
actually
take
a
life
and...
or
in
felony
murder
you
have
to
have,
you
have
to
take
a
life
or
you
have
to
intend
to
kill,
intend
to
do
great
bodily
harm,
or
act
with
reckless
disregard.
so
you
have
that
mental
culpability
in
those
areas,
proof
of
intent,
proof
of
moral
depravity
that
man...
or
that
would,
that
would
make
the
sentence
of
mandatory
life
with
no
parole
more
proportional.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
well,
you're...
this
court
has
said
that
the--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--i
think
the
court
needs
to
have
some
sort
of
discretion
to
decide
whether
the
person
under
this
statute,
whether
they
are
a
major
or
a
minor
participant,
whether
they
are
a
first
time
offender
or
just
a
mule
of
transport.
but
my
main
problem
is
with
the
nonparolability.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
that
would
be
a
close
question,
but
outside
the
realm
of
these
facts.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
i
think
there
needs
to
be
some
sort
of
discretion
to
decide...
this
statute
where
there
is
no
discretion
to
decide
the
culpability
of
the
person,
coupled
with
the
mandatory
life
with
no
chance
of
parole
ever,
is
cruel
and
unusual.
as
to
numbers
of
sentences
where
the
person
probably
won't
live,
i
am
not
sure.
but
the
fact...
they
would
still
serve--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--well,--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--this
court
has
said
that
the
sentence
of
death
is
different
in
kind,
qualitatively
different
than
any
other
sentence
with
a
length
of
years.
but
my
position
is
that
mandatory
life
in
prison
with
no
chance
of
parole
ever
is
death
in
prison.
there
is
no
way
out.
he
will
die
in
prison.
so
for
that
reason
it
is
qualitatively
different.
and
i
feel
that
a
statute
that
has
no
discretion
to
decide
who
is
going
to
be
punished
by
that
statute,
and
coupled
with
the
fact
that
he
will
die
in
prison,
makes
it
more
like
a
death
penalty
case
than
any
other
number
of
years.
and
this
court
has
developed
a
doctrine
of
constitutionality
in
the
death
penalty
cases
for
individualized
sentencing.
as
far
as
mandatory
minimum
sentencings,
if
they
are
small,
like
5
or
10
years,
i
don't
have
a
position
on
that
because
i
haven't
really
studied
that
issue.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
yes.
i
think
the
intentional
taking
of
a
human
life
is
a
crime
that
is
universally
held
to
be
that...
to
show
that
sort
of
depravity.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
i
don't
know
if
that
would
be
a
violation.
a
state
has
a
different
interest
in
trying
to
stop
recidivist
behavior.
and
a
person
who
has
shown
by
their
behavior
that
they
can't
conform
their
behavior
to
societal
norms,
there's
a
whole
different
interest
there
than
in
this
drug
scenario
where
we
have
a
first
time
offender,
where
we
have
possibly
just
a
minor
participant,
and
where
we
have
no
indication
that
if
he
were
paroled
that
he
would
be
any
danger
of
recidivism.
so
there
is
a
different
interest
there.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
the
principle...
i
believe
that
society
agrees
that
the
intentional
taking
of
human
life
is
the
worst
possible
crime
there
is.
this
court
said
in
coker
v.
georgia
that
it
was
all
right
to...
it
was
not
all
right
to
give
the
death
penalty
to
a
person
who
raped
an
adult
woman.
this
court
drew
quite
a
line
there
at
the
intentional
taking
of
human
life,
and
i
think
that
that
line
still
holds.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
because
mandatory
life
in
prison
is
death
in
prison.
the
person
has
no
hope
to
get
out
ever.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
well,
that
is
one
of
the
things
my
argument
hinges
on.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
a
couple
of
things.
you
have
the
solem
v.
helm
test,
where
you
have
to
measure
the
gravity
of
the
offense
with
the
severity
of
the
crime...
i
mean
the
gravity
of
the
punishment
with
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
you
have
to
look
at
what
is
done
with
other
states.
this
court
in
stanford
v.
kentucky
developed
an
evolving
standard
of
decency
test,
where
you
looked
at
what
the
other
50
states
did.
and
as
far
as
this
crime,
michigan
has
the
only
statute
where
there
is
no
discretion
and
there
is
no
parole.
michigan
has
perhaps
a
big
drug
problem,
but
so
do
other
states.
and
our
drug
problem
doesn't
seem
to
be
getting
any
better
with...
because
of
this
law.
the
other
states
have
some
kind
of
discretion
so
that
you
can
decide
whether
a
person
is
a
minor
or
a
major
participant.
there
has
to
be
some
discretion
somewhere.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
yes.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
yes.
and
that
would
fall
in
with
the
solem
v.
helm
analysis
as
well.
in
helm,
the
seven-time
recidivist,
this
court
found
that
his
sentence
was
cruel
and
unusual
as
to
him
because
the
sentence
of
mandatory
life
in
prison
with
no
chance
of
parole
was
so
harsh
compared
to
even
his
seven-time
recidivist
behavior.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
life
imprisonment--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--well,
under
a
mandatory
term
of
years
there
is
parolability.
there
is
good
time,
special
good
time,
all
kinds
of--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--michigan
has
recently--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--michigan
has
recently
struck
down
cases
with
what
they
call
basketball
scores,
where
people
were
given
100
to
200
years.
and
they
did
it
with
actuarial
tables
where
the
sentences
had
to
come
into
what
the
life
realm,
the
life
span
of
the
defendant
would
be.
so
in
michigan,
no
matter
what
kind
of
years
you
are
given,
you
still
have
some
hope
that
some
day
you
will
be
able
to
get
out.
whereas
in
this
mandatory
life--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--thank
you,
justice
stevens.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
and
an
excellent
one.
[laughter]
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
well,
the
standard
i
would
propose,
of
course,
is
the
standard
that
this
court
fashioned
in
solem
v.
helm,
where
you
would
take--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--i
was
taking
that
from
the
coker
case,
where
the...
this
court
said
that
rape
was
different
than
intentional
taking
of
human
life,
and
so
the
sentence
of
death
was
unconstitutional
for
a
person
who
was
convicted
of
rape.
that's
where
i
was
drawing
that
line.
in
michigan
it
is
clear
that
serious
criminal
acts,
such
as
rape,
second
degree
murder,
and
armed
robbery,
are
punished
with
less
severity
than
possession
of
cocaine.
so
you
have
vicious
people,
dangerous
criminals
who
are
convicted
who
can
only
in
michigan
get
up
to
life
in
prison,
but
it
is
not
mandatory
life,
it
is
life
with
parole,
and
it
is
life
with
some
discretion.
the
judge
has
a
chance
to
look
at
the
mitigating
factors
and
decide
what
kind
of
sentence
to
give
a
person.
there
is
discretion
somewhere,
and
there
is
also
parole.
in
this
case,
however,
we've
got
no
discretion
anywhere,
we
have
got
people
who
can
be
kingpins,
people
who
can
be
mules,
people
who
can
be
possessors,
and
they
are
all
getting
mandatory
life
in
prison
with
no
discretion
at
all.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
i
think
the
prosecutor
in
his
brief
has
admitted
that
the
drug
problem
is
getting
worse
and
worse
in
michigan.
every
time
you
put--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--no,
it
hasn't.
every
time
you
catch
a
mule--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--every
time
you
put
a
mule
in
prison
there
is
someone
else
to
take
his
place.
so
as
far
as
deterrence,
this
isn't
working.
if
that
is
going
to
be
a...
any
reason
for
it.
but--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--deterrence
is
a
reason
for
sentencing.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
this--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--well,
most
of
the
people
that
are
taking
this,
these
risks
don't
even
know
what
the
law
is.
this
encourages
the
recruitment
of
juveniles
and
young
people
from
the
inner
city
that
are
the
ones
that
are
carrying
these
packages
for
the
major
dealers.
so
it
isn't
deterring
any
crime
at
all.
the
drug
problem
is
not
such
an
easy
problem.
it's
a
problem
of
unemployment
and
poverty,
and
just
putting
more
and
more
young
people
in
jail
is
not
going
to
solve
anything.
what
are
you
going
to
do
next?
cut
their
arms
off
or
put...
just
sentence
them
all
to
death?
there
is...
you
are
not
solving
the
problem
by
doing
that.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
at
the
time
they
passed
this
law,
the...
some
of
the
opponents
of
the
law
realized
that
what
is
in
reality
happening
might
happen,
that
the
mules
of
transport
would
be
hired
by
the
kingpins
to
carry
the
drugs,
and
that
perhaps
those
people
who
are
often
drug
addicts
would
end
up
doing
this
mandatory
life
in
prison.
the
proponent
of
the
law
now
has
come
out
in
opposition
of
it
and
has
said
that
that
is
what
is
happening.
of
the
123
people
in
michigan
prisons,
that's...
and
there's
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make.
when
a
major
trafficker
is
caught
in
a
state
court,
the
feds
come
in,
take
him
over
to
the
federal
courthouse,
and
give
him
a
chance
to
cooperate,
or
a
chance
to
make
some
sort
of
a
deal
to
get
a
lesser
sentence.
so
the
people
that
we
have
in
our
state
court
are
the
smaller
guys,
the
ones
that
don't
know
enough
to
cooperate,
don't
have
any
information
to
trade.
and
they
are
the
ones
that
are
doing
this
mandatory
life.
and
that
is
one--
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
--i
think
they
have
a...
they
have
the
ability
to
cut
deals
with
people
who
cooperate.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
yes,
there
is
prosecutorial
discretion.
that
is
all
there
is,
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
with
the
law.
because
if,
if
the
person
has
information
they
will
take
him
to
the
federal
courthouse
where
he
can
make
a
deal
and
get
3
or
4
years,
instead
of
mandatory
life.
so
the
people
who
have
no
information,
the
very,
very
small
people,
the
mules
of
transport,
are
the
ones
that
are
getting
this
mandatory
life
in
prison.
and
that
is
what
is
wrong
with
this
law.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
yes.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
the
people
who
were
proposing
this
law
thought
it
would
deter
crime
by
putting
major
traffickers
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
their
life.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
yes,
yes.
that's
the
house
legislative
history,
the
proposed
bills
that
were...
that
were
circulated
at
the
time,
in
committee
and
at
the
time
that
they
were
making
the
laws.
ms.
carla
j.
johnson
yes.
yes,
that
is
official
from
the
legislative
journals
in
michigan.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
