marshall
ms.
johnson,
is
it
true
that
this
hasn't
had
any
effect
in
cutting
down
the
number
of
dope
cases?
justice
marshall
so
it
hasn't
had
an
effect
on
cutting
it
down?
justice
marshall
well,
on
the
deterrence
point,
what
about
those
1,200
that
are
in
prison
now?
justice
marshall
what...
do
you
have
any
figures
to
back
you
up?
justice
marshall
you've
said--
justice
marshall
--i
don't
want...
i
don't
want
anything
outside
the
record.
i
didn't
ask
for
it.
justice
marshall
i
assumed
that
what
you
tell
me
is
in
the
record.
justice
marshall
and
you
haven't
told
me
a
crying
thing
about
the
fact
that
it...
the
crime
of
selling
drugs
has
dropped
off
since
this
statute
was
passed.
justice
marshall
but
you
don't
know
anything
about
what's
happened.
justice
marshall
right.
justice
marshall
you
don't
know
anything
about
that
part.
justice
marshall
well,
what
in
the
world
are
you
arguing
about?
