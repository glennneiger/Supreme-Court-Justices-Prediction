justice
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
this
is
a
mandatory
sentence,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
why
would
you
argue
about
it
before
the
judge,
then?
justice
stevens
ms.
johnson,
let
me
just
see
if
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
trying
to
say
but
you
haven't
quite
said
it.
has...
the
court
has
drawn
a
line
between
some
crimes
for
which
death
is
a
constitutionally
permissible
punishment
and
some
for
which
it
is
not.
and
you
are
saying
this
is
on
the
side
of
the
line
that
would
not
permit
death
to
be
imposed.
justice
stevens
and
therefore
it...
but
the
punishment
nevertheless
is
different
from
all...
therefore
there
may
well
be
a
different
rule
for
this
category
of
punishment
than
there
would
be
for
crimes
for
which
death
would
be
a
permissible
punishment.
and
that
line
has
already
been
drawn
by
the
court.
justice
stevens
ms.
johnson,
may
i
ask
you,
at
the
back
of
your
brief
you
have
a
discussion
of
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
legislation.
what
is
the
official
status
of
that?
it's
called
the
law
librarian.
do
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about?
justice
stevens
what...
tell
me
a
little
bit
about
that,
if
you
would.
justice
stevens
no,
i
know
what
it
says,
but
i
mean
what
is
the...
is
this
an
official
legislative
history
in
michigan?
justice
stevens
so
that
when
it
recites
that
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
opposed
the
legislation,
we
can
count
on
that
as
being
an
official
statement?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
thompson,
it
would
be
the
same
even
if
it
were
diluted,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
so
the
number
of
hits
that
are
possible
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sentence,
does
it?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
if
there
is
672
grams,
1
percent
cocaine,
it
would
be
the
same
sentence.
justice
stevens
but
you
said
it,
you
said
it
was
addictive,
that
is
why
they
did
it.
that
is
not
what
the
report
says.
it
says
it's
a
nonaddictive
drug.
justice
stevens
is
that
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
stevens
it's
just
the
opposite
in
the
legislative
history.
it
is
described
as
a
nonaddictive
drug.
justice
stevens
it
is
no
more
official
than
your
reference
to
this
general
understanding
about--
justice
stevens
--mr.
thompson,
supposing
the
statute...
the
legislature
passed
a
statute
and
said
it
shall
be
mandatory
duty
of
the
prosecutor
to
prosecute
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law
because
this
problem
is
so
serious,
we've
got
to
get
these
people
off
the
street.
you
eliminated
discretion
from
the
prosecutor
for
this
particular
area.
would
that
be
constitutional?
that
doesn't
trouble
you,
does
it?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
find
it
surprising
that
you
defend
the
law
on
the
ground
that
the
prosecutor
might
ignore
it,
which
is
what
you
are
saying.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
is
essential
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
this
law?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
law
would
be
equally
constitutional
if
instead
of
650
grams
it
was
50
grams?
justice
stevens
so...
it's
a
very
simple
case,
then.
justice
stevens
is
it
correct
that
for
this
kind
of
sentence,
unlike
most
others,
the...
there
is
no
interest
in
rehabilitation
to
justify
the
punishment?
the
sole
interest
is
deterrence?
justice
stevens
mr.
thompson,
i
just
don't
understand
this.
what
good
would
it
do
to
address
the
court
under
this
statute?
[laughter]
i
mean,
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
him,
i
don't
like
the
statute?
justice
stevens
i
know,
i'm
not
criticizing
your
response.
but
really,
are
we
talking
about
anything
that
has
to
do
with
the
decision
of
the
issue
before
us?
justice
stevens
i
wonder
if
there
was
an
intervening
election.
[laughter]
