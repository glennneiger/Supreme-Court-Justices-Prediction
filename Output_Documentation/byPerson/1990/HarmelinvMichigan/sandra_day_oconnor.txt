justice
o'connor
ms.
johnson,
does
the
state
allow
commutation
of
sentences
by
the
governor
or
something
of
that
sort?
pardon
or
a
commutation?
justice
o'connor
is
that
ever...
is
that
a
provision
that
is
used
on
occasion
in
michigan?
justice
o'connor
is
it
used
in
some
circumstances
in
michigan?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
this
court
had
made
reasonably
clear
that
outside
the
capital
murder
context
that
mandatory
sentencing
was
all
right.
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
no
mandatory
sentencing
scheme
can
remain
in
effect.
justice
o'connor
that
the
constitution
requires
judicial
discretion.
and
yet
i
had
thought
in
sumner
and
woodson,
and
perhaps
rummel,
that
the
court
had
made
clear
that's
not
the
position
this
court
has
taken.
justice
o'connor
ms.
johnson,
is
there
any
prosecutorial
discretion
still
in
michigan
for
whether
to
prosecute
someone
for
this
particular
offense,
more
than
650
grams?
could
a
prosecutor
decide
the
facts
warranted
prosecution
for
a
smaller
amount?
justice
o'connor
or
just
not
to
charge
the
full
potential
offense.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
so,
while
there
may
not
be
judicial
discretion,
there
still
is
some
built
in
at
the
charging
stage,
in
effect.
justice
o'connor
is
there
a
separate
state
offense
for
possession
with
intent
to
distribute?
justice
o'connor
and
here
the
offense
charged
and
for
which
the
conviction
was
obtained
was
mere
possession,
not
possession
with
intent
to
distribute?
justice
o'connor
--mr.
thompson,
now
suppose
there
is
a
grandmother
that
is
keeping
a
suitcase
for
her
grandson,
who
is
the
mule,
and
it
contains
cocaine.
he's
gone
for
the
weekend,
she
keeps
it
for
him.
life
without
parole,
right?
mere
possession.
justice
o'connor
the
grandson
says
i
hate
to
tell
you
this,
grandmother,
it's
cocaine,
keep
it
for
me
for
the
weekend.
[laughter]
justice
o'connor
what
standard
do
you
think
we
apply
to
test
proportionality
under
the
eighth
amendment?
or
do
we
just
not
make
an
examination
at
all?
justice
o'connor
and
does
any
other
state
have
a
similar
penalty
for
mere
possession?
