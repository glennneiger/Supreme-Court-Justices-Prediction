justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-7272,
ronald
allen
harmelin
v.
michigan.
ms.
johnson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ms.
johnson,
solem
against
helm
was
a
5
to
4
decision,
and
it
cut
back
on
rummel
against
estelle,
which
was
also
a
5
to
4
decision.
do
you
think
the
court
has
reached
equilibrium,
or
do
you
think
that
more
changes
might
take
place?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
they
did
treat
it...
how
do
you
think
they
treated
stare
decisis
in
solem
against
helm?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--ms.
johnson--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--at
page
6
of
the
joint
appendix
the
presentence
report
is
present.
and
the
presentence
report
that
the
judge
had
before
him,
as
i
gather
it,
said
that
police
investigators
described
the
defendant
as
a
largescale
drug
trafficker,
delivering
down
to
mid-level
dealers.
now
the
judge,
even
in
a
different
jurisdiction,
would
have
taken,
been
able
to
take
that
fact
into
consideration,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
just...
this
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
rely
on
the
statutory
definition.
it
says
police
investigators
described
the
defendant
as
a
large-scale
drug
trafficker,
delivering
down
to
mid-level
dealer.
if
the
statute
says
that,
you
don't
need
this.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we're
not
talking
about
a
sixth
amendment
case
here.
you're
challenging
this
on
the
basis
of
the
eighth
amendment.
it's
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
i
think
we
have
to
take
as
a
fact
what
the
judge
had
before
him
in
the
presentence
report.
certainly
he
would
have
used
that
in
sentencing
had
he
had
discretion,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
said
a
moment
ago,
ms.
johnson,
that
you
are
taking
the
position
your
client
had
only
be
convicted
of
possession
and
that
therefore
it
was
at
the
very
bottom
end
of
the
scale.
i
think
the
presentence
report
tends
to
cut
against
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
about
some
very
aggravated
recidivist
situation,
someone
who
four
successive
times
has
committed
aggravated
rape,
or
has
committed
mayhem?
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
to
sentence
them
on
the
conviction
for
the
fourth
time
to
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
johnson.
mr.
thompson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thompson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-7272,
harmelin
against
michigan
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
