87-6796,
james
a.
ford
v.
georgia.
mr.
ogletree.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
ogletree,
will
you
take
a
look
at
page
4
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
has
the
fourth
paragraph,
i
believe,
of
the
motion
that
you
have
been
referring
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it...
there
it
says
the
exclusion
of
members
of
the
black
race
in
the
jury
when
a
black
accused
is
being
tried
will
receive
ex...
or...
et
cetera.
and
then
he
cites
mccray
against
new
york,
which
is
a
cert.
denied,
i
think,
in
our
court--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
taylor
v.
louisiana.
now,
neither
of
those
are
in
their...
by
their
terms
fourteenth
amendment
cases.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where...
where
did,
where
did
the...
where
did
the
petitioner's
lawyer
in
terms
use
the
words
fourteenth
amendment
or
equal
protection
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what,
what
law
did
he
rely
on?
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
he
say
swain?
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
took
it
as
a
swain...
the
prosecutor
took
it
as
a
swain
claim.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ogletree.
ms.
smith,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
smith,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
decide
that
the
petitioner
here
had
adequately
made
a
swain
claim.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
they
say
in
their
opinion
on
remand,
too,
i
think,
that
he
raised
a
swain
claim.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
is
it
your
position
that
after
batson
people
who
simply
had
raised
a
swain
claim
in
the
lower
courts
are
not
entitled
to,
even
though
their
appeals
had
not
become
final,
are
not
entitled
to
have
their
case
reconsidered
under
batson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you...
do
you
think
your...
the
view
you're
expressing
now
is
consistent
with
the
court's
opinion
in
griffith,
where
it
remanded
cases
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
and
to
the
tenth
circuit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
think
they
had
made
actual
batson-type
objection
rather
than
swain-type
objections?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
can
say
the
same
here,
can't
you?
certainly,
if
the
petitioner
raised
a
swain
claim,
it
was
dissatisfaction
with
the
strikes
used.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
yet
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
its
opinion,
i
believe
both
the
first
opinion
and
the
opinion
on
remand,
said
that
he
did
raise
a
swain
claim.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
can't
we
regard
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
saying
that
he
raised
a
swain
claim
and
indicating
not
that
there
was
any
procedural
bar
in
connection
with
the
swain
claim,
as
the
final
word
on
georgia
law
that
he
did
properly
raise
a
swain
claim?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
smith.
mr.
ogletree,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ogletree.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-6796
ford
against
georgia
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
