justice
scalia
--are
you
referring
to
page
11
of
the
joint
appendix?
i...
it
is
really--
justice
scalia
--sort
of
tangential.
the
prosecutor
relies
on
swain
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
peremptory
challenge
system
goes
back
to
the
common
law
and
that
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
burden.
i
don't...
i
don't
take
that
one
sentence
as
being
an
acknowledgement
by
his,
on
his
part
that
the
motion
was
based
on
swain.
justice
scalia
what
about
the
trial
court?
why
do
you
say
the
trial
court
understood
it
as
a...
as
a
fourteenth
amendment
motion?
justice
scalia
on
page
17
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
defense
counsel...
seems
to
me
to
refer
to
the
sixth
amendment.
the
defendant's
right
to
an
impartial
jury
trial
is
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment.
and
there
is
no
mention
of
the
fourteenth
there.
that's
on
page
17.
justice
scalia
mr.
ogletree,
here's
a
problem,
and
i
think
this
is
sort
of
related
to
justice
kennedy's
question
as
to
whether
we
should
do
it
here
or
send
it
back.
suppose
georgia
wants
to
adopt
a
new
procedural
rule,
which
you
say
they
have
done
here,
and
our
case
law
says
they
can't
pluck
a
new
procedural
rule
out
of
the
air,
impose
it
on
your
client,
and
thereby
prevent
federal
review.
but
i
don't
know
that
our
cases
say
that
they
can't
pluck
a
new
procedural
rule
out
of
the
air.
that's
the
way
the
courts
make
law.
they
pick
some
first
case
and
say
well,
we
have
never
had
this
rule
before,
but
you
know,
this
is
our
procedural
rule,
and
you
haven't
followed
it.
justice
scalia
now,
i
can
understand
our
saying
that's
fine
for
georgia,
but
you
can't
preclude
federal
review
on
the
basis
of
that
new
rule.
but
do
you
want
us
to
say
to
georgia
you
cannot
impose
that
new
rule?
justice
scalia
but
sparks
was
prospective,
so
you
are
saying
all
the
rules
that
georgia
makes
have
to
be
prospective.
justice
scalia
ms.
smith,
wouldn't
the
same
problem
of
prematurity
exist
for
a
swain
claim
as
would
exist
for
a
batson
claim?
can
you...
can
you
object
to
a,
you
know,
a
pattern
of
striking
by
race
when
that
has
not
yet
occurred
in
your
very
case?
it
doesn't...
isn't
it
the
same
problem
for
swain
as
it
is
for
batson?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
could
you
crank
that
up
a
bit?
i
am
having
trouble
hearing
you.
justice
scalia
you
would
have
a
swain
claim
even
if
the
prosection
strikes
no
blacks,
in
your
case?
justice
scalia
no,
it
doesn't
depend
on
that
at
all.
you
clearly
wouldn't,
would
you?
justice
scalia
which
means
that
your
swain
claim
is
just
as
premature
if
you
make
it
before
the
actual
empaneling
of
the
jury
as
would
be
your
batson
claim.
justice
scalia
not
sufficient,
but
necessary,
at
least.
justice
scalia
gee,
i
think
it's
extraordinary
that
you,
you
have
a
claim...
a
case
in
which
the
prosecutor
strikes
no
blacks
from
the
jury
at
all,
and
you
nonetheless
have
a
swain
claim.
and
therefore
you
can
make
it
before
the
empaneling
of
the
jury
occurs.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
your
court
said
the
swain
claim
was
not
premature,
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't
bound
to
say
the
batson
claim
isn't
as
well.
