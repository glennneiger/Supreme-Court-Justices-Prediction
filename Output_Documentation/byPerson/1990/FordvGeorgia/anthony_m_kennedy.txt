justice
kennedy
can
there
be
any
quibble,
counsel,
over
whether
or
not
it's
clear
that
a
fourteenth
amendment
swain
claim
was
raised,
as
opposed
to
a
sixth
amendment
fair
cross-section
of
the
community?
is
the
record
clear
on
that
point?
justice
kennedy
what,
what
about
at
the
trial?
justice
kennedy
because
he
mentioned
the
swain
case?
justice
kennedy
mr.--
--well,
counsel,
if
there
is
a
state
procedural
ground
that's
not
an
adequate
bar,
doesn't
that
mean
that
we
simply
hear
the
claim
here,
rather
than
remand
it?
do
you
have
any
authority
for
us
to
say
that
we...
tell
the
georgia
court
that
its
state
procedural
rule
is
inadequate
and
therefore
that
it
must
consider
the
claim?
justice
kennedy
but
do
you...
do
you
have
any
authority
for
us
to
require
the
georgia
court
to
hear
a
federal
substantive
claim
if
it
has
a
procedural
bar
rule
of
its
own?
i
had
thought
our
cases
taught
that
that
simply
doesn't
prevent
us
from
reaching
the
issue.
justice
kennedy
rather
than
requiring
georgia
to--
justice
kennedy
--so
this
would
be...
so
this
would
be
an
extension
of
our
precedents?
justice
kennedy
well,
do
we
have
enough
in
this
record
to
say
that
there
was
a
batson
violation
in
not
asking
the
prosecutor
to
state
the
grounds?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
that
sufficient
for
us
to
do
that
right
here?
just
like
in
an
erroneous
submission
of
evidence.
we
just
say
the
evidence
was
admissible
or
inadmissible.
we
just
say
the
prosecutor
had
to
state
his
reasons.
