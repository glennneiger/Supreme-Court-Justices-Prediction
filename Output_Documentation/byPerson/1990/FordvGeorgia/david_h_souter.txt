justice
david
h.
souter
in
this
case
which
is
before
us
for
a
second
time,
we
assess
the
adequacy
of
a
state
procedural
rule
by
our
review
of
the
federal
constitutional
claim
raised
by
the
petitioner
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution.
the
petitioner
is
a
black
man
who
alleges
that
the
state
of
georgia
applied
the
criterion
of
race
to
exclude
black
from
the
jury
members
from
his
jury
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
he
seeks
to
prove
his
equal
protection
claim
under
the
standard
established
by
this
court
in
batson
versus
kentucky.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
petitioner
had
failed
to
raise
a
batsons
claim
at
trial
and
held
that
even
if
he
had,
the
claim
was
not
timely
under
a
state
procedural
rule
announced
after
the
petitioners
trial.
we
reverse.
the
petitioner
raised
an
equal
protection
claim
at
trial
subject
to
the
standard
of
proof
articulated
in
batsons
antecedents
slane
in
alabama.
in
slane,
this
court
recognized
as
an
equal
protection
violation
the
claim
of
the
thought
petitioner
seeks
to
prove,
that
slane
establish
a
rigorous
standard
for
proving
such
a
violation.
our
subsequent
holding
in
batson,
which
was
decided
after
petitioners
trial,
did
not
change
the
nature
of
the
violation
but
merely
the
quantum
of
proof
necessary
to
substantiate
a
particular
claim.
because
petitioner
raised
a
claim
under
slane,
it
falls
that
he
raise
to
claim
under
batson
as
well.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
nonetheless,
held
that
petitioners
batson
claim
was
untimely
under
a
procedural
rule
announced
by
that
court
in
1987
almost
three
years
after
the
petitioner
was
tried
and
convicted.
while
it
is
generally
true
that
local
law
will
determine
whether
a
constitutional
claim
is
timely,
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
may
not
by
review
of
a
federal
constitutional
claim
is
timely
under
a
state
procedural
rule
that
was
not
firmly
established
and
regularly
followed
as
to
the
time
to
which
it
is
to
be
applied.
in
this
case,
the
procedural
rule
applied
by
the
georgia
court
was
announced
long
after
petitioners
trial
and
the
state
may
not
apply
it
to
buy
a
subsequent
federal
review
of
the
claim.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
