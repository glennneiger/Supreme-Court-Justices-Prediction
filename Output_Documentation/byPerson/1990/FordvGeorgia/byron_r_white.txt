there,

justice
white
and
that
there
must
be
a
batson
hearing.
justice
white
which
we
certainly
wouldn't
undertake.
justice
white
the
prosecutor
should
have
a
chance
to--
justice
white
--to
explain
what
his
strikes
were
all
about.
justice
white
well,
if
the
same
objection
that
he
made
before
trial,
literally,
was
made...
had
been
made
just
before
the
jury
was
sworn,
would
you
say
that
he
had
made
a
batson
objection?
justice
white
yes,
but
suppose,
suppose
the...
just
before
the
jury
was
sworn
in
this
case...
and
i
guess
the
jury
was
all
white
except
one?
justice
white
and
there
had
been
10
strikes
at
blacks?
justice
white
nine,
yes.
all
right.
and
if
he,
if
he
said
exactly
what
he
had
said
before
trial,
that
please
make
the
prosecutor
give
his
reasons
for
striking--
justice
white
--now
that
would
have
been
a
batson
objection,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
and
it
would
have...
and
the
fact
of
striking
nine
blacks
would
have,
would
have
been
a
satisfactory
basis
for
making
the
profit...
for
making
the
prosecutor
say--
justice
white
--no,
i
understand,
you
say...
you
say
that
his
pretrial
objection
was
not
sufficient.
justice
white
i
mean
at
the
time...
at
the
time
he
was
tried,
what
was...
where
do
you
find
the
rule?
justice
white
well,
the
trial
court
certainly
didn't
say
that
his
pretrial
motion
was
premature.
it
ruled
on
it.
justice
white
so
the
trial
court
shouldn't
have
ruled
on
it?
it
should
have
said
premature?
justice
white
for
a
swain
claim
you
could
have
made
it
pretrial?
justice
white
well,
if
you...
and
if
the
swain
claim
is
enough
to
raise
an
equal
protection
claim,
which
it
is,
and
if
it's
enough
to
raise
a
batson
claim,
how
was
he
supposed
to
know
that
he
was...
that
he
was
to
renew
his
swain
claim
before
the
jury
was
sworn?
justice
white
so
if
his
motion
had
just
cited
swain
and
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
would
have
been
consistent
with
georgia
law
at
the
time?
pretrial.
justice
white
and
he
would
not
have
had
to
renew
it
before
the
jury
was
sworn?
justice
white
so,
you
are
not
urging
that
the...
that
the...
that
the
rule
laid
down
in
sparks...
is
that
it?
in
sparks?
justice
white
is
applicable
in
this
case?
justice
white
and
that
the
court
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
if
that
had
never...
had
never
decided
sparks?
