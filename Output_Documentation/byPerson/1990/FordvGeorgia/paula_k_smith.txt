ms.
paula
k.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
here
today
involves
the
validity
of
the
finding
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
that
any
batson
claim
was
not
preserved
for
review
on
the
merits
due
to
the
lack
of
an
objection
at
trial
when
the
conduct
giving
rise
to
the
claim
had
occurred.
petitioner
contends
that
the
application
of
the
procedural
bar
in
this
case
does
not
constitute
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground,
because
he
contends
the
rule
was
allegedly
novel
and
allegedly
announced
after
the
fact.
and
he
also
contends
that
this
finding
of
lack
of
preservation
is
inconsistent
with
griffith.
the
state
submits
that
the
facts
of
this
case
will
show
that
the
bar
as
applied
in
this
case
is
not
novel,
but
is
at
most
a
specific
application
of
a
general
procedural
default
rule
which
has
been
in
place
in
georgia--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--that
apparently
is
the
treatment
it
was
given
on
the
first
direct
appeal,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
that
is
our
position,
your
honor,
because
of
the
lack
of
objection
in
this
case
to
the
manner
in
which
the
prosecutor
used
his
strikes
on
the
petit
jury.
we
submit
that
there
was
a
factual
distinction
between
batson
and
swain.
that
factual
distinction
is
apparent
in
looking
at
the
language
of
swain
itself
and
discussing
when
the
presumption
of
the
impartiality
of
the
prosecutor
strikes
is
overcome.
swain
discussed
how
it
cannot
be
overcome
by
the
use
of
strikes
in
the
case
at
hand.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
we
submit
that
it
is,
your
honor.
griffith
himself
objected.
batson
had
objected.
justice
powell's
opinion
in
batson
discusses
objections.
brown
had
objected.
the
third,
the
fifth,--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--from
a
reading
of
the
opinions,
your
honor,
it
is
clear
that
after
the
jury
had
been
selected
in
their
respective
cases,
some
sort
of
objection
or
motion
evidencing
dissatisfaction
with
the
strikes
used
in
that
case
was
made.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
but
it
was
before
the
strikes
had
been
utilized,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
the
lack
of
objection
following
those
use
of
strikes
is
what
is
fatal
to
petitioner's
claim
in
this
case.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
that
is
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
held
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
he
was...
we
feel
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
object
when
the
conduct
occurred--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--that
is
what
the
record
shows,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
nine
by
the
prosecution,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
that
would
have
been
a
batson
objection.
we're
not--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
can't
go
to
the
merits
at
this
point.
i
would
not
concede
that
would
be
a
prima
facie
case.
but
our
point
is
he
never
objected
when
what
he
sought
to
prevent
occurred.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
it
was
not
sufficient.
it
can
either
be
viewed
as
premature
or
incomplete.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--in...
hypothetically
speaking--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--yes,
it
is.
but
based
upon
the
motion
filed
in
this
case,
petitioner
sought
to
raise
two
claims.
petitioner
cites
to
the
alleged
systematic
exclusion
of
the
prosecutor
in
the
pretrial
motion,
but
he
also
sought
to
change
the
law.
and
in
paragraphs
3
and
4
of
his
pretrial
motion
he
cites
mccray.
he
cites
taylor.
and
we
submit
that
this
evidences
an
intent
to
focus
the
inquiry
upon
the
prosecutor's
use
of
strikes
upon
the
petit
jury
in
this
case.
he
is
anticipating
a
change
in
the
law.
and
we
submit
that
when
that
conduct
occurred,
that
is
when
he
should
have
objected
to
say,
see,
i
told
you
this
was
going
to
happen,
and
it
did.
i'm
not
happy.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i
don't
think
there's
a
question
as
to
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
record
as
to
whether
he
was--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
evidence
that
he
was
misled
up
until
the
motion
for
new
trial
hearing,
when
it
was
asserted
by
new
counsel
that
the
motion
had
been
renewed
and--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
think
that
there
are
various
purposes
of
procedural
bars,
your
honor,
and
that
is
to
prevent--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i...
i--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
don't
think
that
the
judge
was
misled,
but
we
submit
that
that
does
not
excuse
the...
the
petitioner's
conduct.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
it
did
not,
your
honor.
it
treated
only
the
swain
aspect
of
the
claim.
although
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
not
specifically
cite
swain
in
its
opinion,
it
treated
it
as
a
systematic
exclusion.
although--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--they
found
that
the
failure
to
object
in
cherry
was...
did
not
satisfy
cause.
this
was
in
a
habeas
corpus
context.
they...
the
court
found
that
the
failure
to
object
could
not
be
excused
by
novelty
of
swain,
and
in
fact
the
author
of
the
cherry
opinion
was
the
author
of
the
dissent
in
this
particular
case.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
apparently
the
georgia
supreme
court
had
not
focused
upon
that
distinction
because,
as
swain
itself
notes,
that
what
occurs
in
the
case
at
hand
is
not
sufficient--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--what
occurs
in
the
case
at
hand
in
swain
is
not
sufficient
to
overcome
the
presumption.
so
the
matter...
the
manner
in
which
the
prosecutor
uses
his
strikes
in
swain
would
merely
add,
i
would
submit,
to
a
defendant's
proof,
but
that
a
pretrial
motion--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--it
depends
on
whether
or
not
he
can
establish
systematic
exclusion.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i
don't
think--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
there,
there
are
a
plethora
of
cases
from
states
and
circuits
indicating
that
a
single
case
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
swain,
and
i
would
submit
that
if
you
are
able
to
establish
a
pattern--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
would
think
that
that
would
be
one
more
element
of
the
defendant's
proof,
but
is
not
dispositive
either
way.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i
think
had
he
attempted
to
establish
systematic
exclusion
at
that
point,
your
honor,
he
might
have
prevailed
on
a
swain
claim.
georgia
had
not
made
that
distinction
in
prior
swain
cases.
we
submit
that
the
facts
in
this
record
is
positive
with
the
issues
before
the
court.
i
think
the
parties
agree
that
a
pretrial
motion
was
filed,
that
it
was
raised
in
the
amended
motion
for
new
trial
by
new
post-trial
counsel
who
was
not
trial
counsel,
and
it
was
raised
in
the
first
appeal.
but
we
strenuously
disagree
as
to
whether
any
such
unrecorded
objection
was
made
after
the
jury
was
struck
in
this
case,
and
that
any
renewed
motion
gave
rise
to
the
colloquy
on
the
second
day
of
trial
when
the
trial
court
placed
the
composition
of
the
jury
and
the
manner
in
which
the
strikes
had
been
used
on
the
record.
regarding
the
colloquy
of...
in
chambers,
the
record
itself
does
not
show
that
this
was
placed
on
the
record
at
the
petitioner's
insistence.
this
is
simply
the
characterization
which
has
been
given
this
colloquy
by
post-trial
counsel
drawn
again
at
the
motion
for
new
trial
hearing.
the
trial
transcript
shows
that
when
this
colloquy
occurred
it
was
on
the
second
day
of
trial.
the
state
had
presented
eight
witnesses
who
had
given
testimony,
and
it
was
prior
to
resuming
after
lunch
that
the
trial
court
placed
two
matters
on
the
record.
one
was
ascertaining
the
views
of
the
parties
on
whether
the
jurors
could
go
vote
in
a
local
election,
and
then
the
composition
as
to
the
jury
and
the
use
of
strikes
was
placed
on
the
record
by
the
trial
court.
we
further
submit
that
at
this...
it
was
at
this
colloquy
where
petitioner
merely
agreed
with
the
numbers
as
stated
by
the
trial
court,
but
did
not
renew
his
motion
specifically
on
this
record.
when
the
prosecutor
volunteered
to
give
his
reasons,
counsel
for
petitioner
stood
mute.
we
submit--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
will
state,
your
honor,
that
we
simply
cannot
know,
because
it
was
not
made.
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
other
procedural
default
cases
that
perceived
futility
does
not
excuse
a
failure
to
object.
and
we
submit
that
due
to
the
nature
of
a
batson
claim
itself,
it
was
incumbent
upon
counsel
to
complete
his
claim
by
saying
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
when
this
conduct
in
fact
occurred,
we
are
not
happy
with
the
jury.
a
fair
reading
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
opinion
shows
that
it
was
not
petitioner's
failure
to
articulate
a
specific
motion,
use
talismanic
words,
it
was
his
total
lack
of
objection.
in
looking
at
sparks
itself,
the...
sparks
made
a
motion
for
mistrial
after
the
jury
had
been
sworn,
but
before
the
state
had
begun
presenting
any
testimony
in
the
case.
and
the
court
said
it
was
made
relatively
promptly
in
sparks,
given
the
fact
that
batson
had
not
been
announced
at
the
time
of
his
trial,
but
it
was
before
jeopardy
had
attached
and
before
the
state
had
developed
any
evidence.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
we
submit
that
swain,
as
a
question
of
fact,
is
not
the
same
as
batson.
that--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--swain
allows
a
defendant
to
try
to
establish
a
systematic
pattern
of
exclusion
by
the
prosecutor
in
case
after
case,
no
matter
the
defendant.
batson
narrows
that
relevant
universe
to
the
defendant's
trial
itself.
we
submit
that
that
is
why
it
was
incumbent
upon
this
petitioner
to
object
at
this
trial.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
apparently
so,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
we
submit--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--we
cited
in
our
brief
both
the
unified
appeal
procedure,
which
was
followed
in
this
case
and
which
the
court
itself
cites
in
the
first
appeal
of
this
case
regarding
failure
to
preserve
issues
for
lack
of
objection.
we
also
cited
a
1982
amendment
to
georgia's
habeas
corpus
statute,
which
is
in
georgia
in
effect
our
state
contemporaneous
objection
rule
in
its
strictest
form.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
under
swain,
and
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
georgia
law
on
this
point,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
i
think
for
a
swain
claim
it
didn't...
that
distinction
was
not
in
existence
in
georgia
law.
the
only
timeliness
cases
that--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--apparently
under
georgia
law
you
could,
your
honor.
the
one
case
in
which
it
was--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--because
he
was
raising
both
swain
and
a
sixth
amendment
claim,
your
honor,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
his
raising
of
the
sixth
amendment
claim
that
evidenced
his
intent
to
focus
upon
the
petit
jury
that
required
him
to--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i...
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
georgia
law
has
not
made
that
distinction.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
it,
it...
looking
at...
there
are
four
paragraphs
in
the
motion,
and
looking
at,
he
alleges
in
paragraph
2,
he
alleges
systematic
exclusion
without
citing
swain,
and
in
paragraph
4
of
the
motion
he
also
cites
mccray
and
taylor
and
sixth
amendment
as
well.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
you
can.
we
submit
that
merely
looking
at
sparks
in
the
context
of
georgia
law
at
the
time,
not
only
do
we
have
the
unified
appeal
procedure,
the
1982
amendment,
you
have
statutes
governing
jury
selection
in
this
case.
there
is
a
specific
statute
which
indicates
when
you
must
object
to
a
juror
being
sworn
for
cause.
we
submit
that
petitioner's
reliance
upon
mccray,
in
which
justice
marshall
in
his
dissent
discussed
how
a
sixth
amendment
claim
was
raised
in
california.
his
reliance
upon
other
jurisdictions
indicates
that
he
was
aware
that
other
people
were
perceiving
this
claim
and
were
making
objections
or
motions
for
mistrial,
or
evidencing
some
sort
of
dissatisfaction
after
the
conduct
complained
of
occurred.
and
we
submit
that
the
claim
in
this
case
is
not
so
novel
that
he
could
not
have
had
notice
to
have
objected.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
we
submit
that
they
merely
relied
upon
sparks
because
they
had
already
decided
in
sparks
itself
when
a
claim
would
or
would
not
be
timely.
it
was
not
a
mechanistic
application
of
sparks
in
this
case
that
yielded
the
result.
it
was
the
lack
of
an
objection
by
petitioner
in
this
case
that
the
opinion
of
the
georgia
supreme
court--
ms.
paula
k.
smith
--i
submit
that
it
would
have,
your
honor.
i
think
sparks
simply
announced
prospectively
this
is
the
latest
point
at
which
you
can
make
a
challenge
and
preserve
a
batson
claim.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
he
made
a
motion
for
mistrial
after
the
prosecutor
used
his
strikes
in
this
case.
the
jury
had
been
sworn,
but
the
state
had
not
begun
presenting
any
evidence.
ms.
paula
k.
smith
it
was
the
motion
for
mistrial.
and
in
the
mincey
case,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
batson
claim
was
preserved
by
making
a
motion
for
continuance.
so,
again,
we
submit
this
evidences
the
rationale
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
finding
that
it
was
not
that
he
didn't
comply
with
sparks,
but
that
he
made
no
objection
whatsoever
at
trial
to
the
manner
in
which
this
jury
was
selected
that
was
fatal
to
his
claim.
and
in
answer
to
one
of
your
earlier
questions,
justice
stevens,
georgia
does
not
apply
a
procedural
default
rule,
a
waiver
of
the
waiver
by
the
state
rule.
if
the
trial
court
has
reached
the
merits,
that
does
not
bind
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
by
the
same
token,
if
the
state
did
not
assert
procedural
default
or
if
the
trial
court
rejected
procedural
default,
that
does
not
bar
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
from
applying
procedural
default.
we
submit
that
the
crux
of
the
case
is
what
this
court
meant
by
the
remand
order
in
griffith,
and
we
submit
that
there's
a
distinction
between
retroactivity
and
preservation
of
a
claim.
under
the
principles
of
retroactivity
an
examination
is
undertaken
to
see
if
a
rule
is
in
fact
applicable.
under
preservation
of
the
claim
one
assumes
the
applicability
of
the
claim,
but
merely
looks
to
see
if
the
claim
itself
is
preserved.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
all
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
here
in
this
case,
and
found
that
petitioner's
conduct
did
not
fall
in
line
with
those
persons
in
batson,
griffith,
and
brown,
who
had
not
had
the
benefit
of
this
court's
decision
telling
them
to
object,
but
perceived
the
claim
as
being
based
upon
the
challenge
of
strikes
in
their
trial,
and
evidenced
some
sort
of
timely
dissatisfaction
through
objection,
motion
for
mistrial,
or
whatever
form.
and
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
this
case
is
not
inconsistent
with
griffith.
and
we
would
urge
this
court
