justice
o'connor
mr.
ogletree,
is
it
your
position
that
all
swain
claims
are
necessarily
batson
claims
as
well?
or
do
you
rely
on
some
particular
facts
specific
to
the
pretrial
motion
here?
justice
o'connor
i
just
wonder
what
your
position
was
on
that.
justice
o'connor
well,
so
your
answer
to
me
is
you
say
that
swain...
all
swain
claims
necessarily
include
a
batson
claim?
justice
o'connor
in
effect.
okay.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
i
understand
that
you
take
the
position
that
because
it
was
made
pretrial,
it
was
a
swain
claim,
not
a
batson
claim?
but
if
the
same
thing
had
been
presented
after
the
strikes
had
occurred,
it
would
have
been
a
batson
claim?
justice
o'connor
do
i
understand
that
was
your
response
to
justice
white?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
it
was.
justice
o'connor
ms.
smith,
now
the
first
time
this
case
went
to
the
georgia
supreme
court,
it
didn't
find
a
procedural
bar,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
in
1988
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
cherry
against
abbott
appeared
to
say
that
swain
and
batson
claims
raised
the
same
issue.
