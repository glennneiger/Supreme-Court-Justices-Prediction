mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
james
a.
ford
is
here
after
the
georgia
supreme
court,
in
light
of
this
supreme
court's
ruling
and
remand,
failed,
in
our
opinion,
to
apply
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
to
justify
the
denial
of
his
reef...
relief,
under
batson
v.
kentucky.
in
this
case
mr.
ford,
a
black
defendant,
was
tried
in
coweta
county,
georgia,
on
a
capital
murder
case.
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
mr.
ford's
lawyer
filed
a
motion
specifically
asking
the
court
pretrial
to
restrict
the
prosecutor
from
using
its
peremptory
challenges
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner
that
would
exclude
members
of
the
black
race
from
the
jury.
in
fact,
in
the
argument
of
that
motion
pretrial,
mr.
ford's
lawyer
specifically
asked
the
court
to
require
the
district
attorney
if
he
does
use
his
peremptory
challenges
to
exclude
potential
black
jurors,
to
justify
on
the
record
by
his
reasons
for
doing
so.
and
he
went
on
to
say
the
failure
to
do
so
would
conclude,
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
only
done
because
those
jurors
were
in
fact
black.
at
the
time
this
motion
was
made
the
court
and
the
prosecutor
was
clear
that
mr.
ford
was
asking
for
relief,
not
only
in
terms
of
what
swain
v.
alabama
held,
but
beyond
that.
he
was
asking
for
relief
in
his
specific
case.
in
fact,
he
also
had
complied
completely
with
the
uniform
appellate
procedure
in
georgia.
that
procedure
at
the
time
required
counsel
to
pretrial
file
motions
on
all
issues
so
that
the
court
could
rule
on
them
in
a
timely
and
reasonable
fashion.
moreover,
that
procedure
did
not
say
anything
about
specifically
how
peremptory
challenges
should
be
handled,
because
in
1984,
when
this
case
was
tried,
there
were
not
procedures
in
georgia
specifically
telling
counsel
about
the
time
and
manner
in
which
these
arguments
could
be
made.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
the
record
is
unmistakably
clear
on
that
point.
counsel
not
only
argued
it
in
his
pretrial
motion,
he
argued
it
at
the
time
of
the
motion.
the
prosecutor
and
court
assumed
it
as
that.
in
his
brief
in
direct
appeal
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
he
specifically
raises
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
sixth
amendment
claims.
he
raised
the
fourteenth
amendment
explicitly
in
his
motion--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--it
was
pretrial,
we
submit,
that
on
the...
in
the
pretrial
motion
it
was
clear
that
he
was
raising
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim,
as
well
as
a
sixth
amendment
claim.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
because
he
mentioned
the
swain
case,
because
what
he
was
asking
for
in
this
particular
case
was
to
restrict
the
prosecutor's
ability
to
strike
black
jurors
without
giving
any
reasons,
and
that
he
should
be
required
to
give
reasons.
and
we
submit
that
on
the
language
and
his
motion,
and
the
court's
interpretation
of
that,
that
he
made
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
well,
that
has
been
a
central
issue
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
the
position
is
that
swain
claim...
we
submit
that
swain
claims
and
batson
claims
are
similar
in
that
batson,
in
our
interpretation
of
what
this
court
did,
was
to
relieve
the
enormous
evidentiary
burden
that
swain
established,
and
to
say
if
you
raise
a
valid,
legitimate--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
we
would
submit
on
this
record
that
it's
even
more
than
that.
even
though...
[inaudible]
a
swain
claim
had
been
properly
preserved,
counsel
in
this
case
went
beyond
that,
and
in
the
specific
case
went
on
to
ask
the
court
to
require
the
prosecutor
to
give
reasons
for
his
peremptory
challenges.
in
fact,
the
prosecutor
said
his
reasons
could
be
based
on
blue
eyes,
that
there
was
no
reason.
and
in
fact
what
counsel
had
at
a
pretrial
hearing
was
in
effect
a
clear
ruling
by
the
judge
that
there
was
no
basis
for
him
to
challenge
the
way
the
prosecutor
would
ultimately
use
the
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that
is
correct,
chief...
mr.
chief
justice.
and
in
fact,
if
i
understand
your
question,
as
the
case
was
actually
presented
for
argument
in
the
pretrial
motion,
counsel
renewed
his
motion,
and
i
think
more
explicitly,
in
his
language
to
the
court
at
the
pretrial
motion
said
the
prosecutor
should
be
required
to
give
reasons
for
these
action
strikes.
and
we
submit
was
arguing
not
simply
on
the
basis
of
taylor
and
mccray
at
that
time--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--the
counsel
did
not
use
those
terms
explicitly.
what
he
argued
for
in
the
particular
case
was,
and
these
particular
facts,
the
prosecutor
having
decided
to
strike
all
black,
potential
black
jurors,
that
he
should
be
required
to
justify
on
the
record
those
strikes
in
his
case,
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
all
he
relied
on
in
the
pretrial
argument
was
what
was
existent
then,
both
swain--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--he
did
not,
but
in
fact
the
prosecutor
did.
the
prosecutor
said
what
counsel
is
asking
for
is
something
under
swain.
he
hasn't
met
swain's
burden.
in
the
pretrial
motion
the
prosecutor
expressly
says
swain
is
what
he
is
relying
on.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
not
only
the
prosecutor,
but
the
court
did
as
well.
the
court
went
on
to
state
his
view
of
how
georgia
law
had
developed,
and
that
prosecutors
had
given
various
reasons.
and
they
didn't
have
to
state
a
reason.
in
fact
the
court
had
in
effect
issue
a
declaratory
statement
that
in
fact
the
prosecutor
has
to
give
no
reason
in
this
case.
it
is
also
significant
that
what
the
trial
court
did
in
denying
counsel's
motion
was
not
to
say
that
he
has
taken
under
advisement,
or
not
to
say
that
as
a
preliminary
ruling,
but
made
a
firm
and
flat
ruling
saying
there
is
nothing
that
mr.
ford
could
do
after
i
deny
this
pretrial
motion
to
further
establish
a
swain
or
batson
claim.
in
fact,
it
is
significant
that
in
1984,
when
this
was
raised,
counsel
in
effect
was
really
arguing
the
precursor
to
batson
by
asking
for
application
of
batson
in
his
case,
and
asking
the
prosecutor
to
give
specific
reasons.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
first
supreme
court
opinion
in
georgia,
the
lower
court
said
that
he
had
not
established
a
swain
claim.
it
said
that
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
show
that
9
out
of
10
black
jurors
had
been
struck
was
not
enough
to
meet
swain.
the
court
cited
moore
v.
state
there.
the
case
that
underlies
moore
v.
state
is
blackwell
v.
state,
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
by
the
state
of
georgia,
specifically
on
the
swain
claim
and
upholding
the
fourteenth
amendment
grounds.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
in
the--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--in
the
joint--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
clear
that
both
the
nature
of
the
motion,
the
way
the
court
understood
it,
the
way
the
georgia
supreme
court
understood
it,
the
way
the
prosecutor
responded
here--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--the...
what
the
trial
court
did
in
effect
was
to
say
that
in
light
of
what
you
have
argued
i
am
taking
into
consideration
among
other
things
that
prosecutor
should
not
be
required
to
show
that
there
should
be
restrictions
on
the
racial
use
of
peremptory
challenges.
the
trial
court
makes
that
explicit
in
its
rulings.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
if
the
court
will
look
at
page
11,
when
the
prosecutor
in
effect
cites
swain,
the
prosecutor
goes
on
and
says,
in
explaining
swain,
and
explained
this
case.
if
this
is
the
particular
reason
he
wants
to
do
that
today,
the
defense
counsel,
i
would
oppose
the
motion.
i
must
object
to
the
statement
that
was
made,
too.
the
prosecutor
sees
it
as
a
swain
claim,
and
in
fact
is
telling
the
court
i
understand
it
as
a
swain
claim,
and
under
swain
i
have
the
right
to
do
whatever
i
want
to
do
to
use
my
peremptory
challenges.
so
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
that
the
prosecutor
understood
it,
the
defense
counsel
understood
it,
and
the
trial
court
understood
it
at
the
time
that
it
was
raised.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
litigated
before
the
georgia
supreme
court,
at
the
time
in
the
new
trial
motion,
that
issue
was
never
raised.
in
fact,
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief
on
the
direct
appeal
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
that
swain
was
the
issue,
the
fourteenth
issue...
fourteenth
amendment
issue
had
been
raised
and
was
fairly
presented.
it
is
only
after
this
court's
remand,
and
without
hearing
from
the
parties,
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
for
the
first
time
says
that
counsel
has
failed
to
make
a
record
of
this
to
survive
a
batson
claim.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that...
that's
precisely
right.
i
think
it's
significant
to
note
as
well
not
only
do
we
submit
that
counsel
made
an
adequate
claim,
but
if
you
look
at
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
on
remand,
i
think
it's
particularly
telling.
while
the
georgia
supreme
court
claims
that
there
was
an
adequate
independent
state
ground
and
the
government
argues
that
today,
it
really
is
an
unavailing
argument.
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
says,
particularly
in
sparks
v.
united
states...
sparks
v.
state,
is
three
significant
points
that
i
hope
this
court
would
focus
upon.
in
spark...
first
of
all,
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
clear
in
saying
at
the
time
sparks
was
decided
in
1987,
that
there
had
been
no,
and
i
repeat
no,
judicial
guidelines
regarding
the
time
and
manner
in
which
a
claim
is
to
be
presented
and
preserved
under
batson.
sparks
is
significant
for
another
reason.
in
sparks
the
court
makes
clear
and
says
it
is
perspective.
the
court
in
sparks
says
hereafter
any
claim
under
batson
should
be
raised
prior
to
the
time
the
jurors
selected
to
try
the
case
are
sworn.
that
is
1987.
and
finally,
and
most
significantly,
the
georgia
supreme
court
went
on
to
say
that
sparks,
having
failed
to
comply...
sparks
is
in
a
worse
position,
we
submit,
than
ford.
in
sparks
there
was
no
pretrial
motion.
the
first
objection
by
sparks
did
not
come
until
after
jury
selection,
after
the
jury
was
sworn,
and
after
evidence
was
taken.
and
yet
the
georgia
supreme
court
decides
that
sparks
would
receive
the
benefit
of
this
new
rule.
and
mr.
ford,
whose
case
was
tried
30
months
before
sparks
was
decided,
whose
appeals
were
perfected
19
months
before
sparks
was
decided,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
says,
has
no
availing
argument.
the
lack
of
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground,
we
submit,
is
another
and
clear
basis
for
this
court
to
disagree
with
the
georgia
supreme
court's
ruling.
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
these
state
procedures
must
be
firmly
established
and
regularly
followed.
in
sparks
it
is
clear
it's
the
first
time
that
any
procedures
were
established,
and
it's
clear
it's
the
first
time
that
any
procedures
were
followed,
and
they
were
not
in
existence
at
the
time
mr.
ford's
case
was
litigated.
moreover,
in
staub
and
the
court's
most
recent
pronouncement
in
osborne
and
other
cases,
this
course...
this
court
has
made
clear
that
defense
counsel
should
not
be
forced
to
engage
in
an
arid
ritual,
a
meaningless
forum,
and
try
to
preserve
these
claims
when
in
fact
in
this
case
mr.
ford,
given
the
law
that
existed,
given
the
uniform
appellate
procedure
in
georgia,
and
given
his
understanding
of
what
he
had
to
do,
made
a
claim.
he
also
had
a
firm
ruling
from
the
trial
court
in
terms
of
what
he
could
do.
he
also
had
a
in-trial
colloquy
where
in
that
colloquy
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
in
fact,
that
9
out
of
10
black
jurors
had
been
struck.
they
weren't
all
struck,
but
regardless
of
that,
the
trial
court
said
it
doesn't
matter
now.
i
have
ruled,
i
have
denied
mr.
ford's
relief.
there
is
nothing
he
could
have
done
to
preserve
his
claim.
in
fact,
as
the
dissenting
opinion
says
in
ford
v.
state
the
second
time
around,
the
dissent,
i
think,
is
significant
in
noting
that
mr.
ford,
and
the
government
seems
to
argue,
could
not
have
won
this
case.
he
could
not
have
preserved
batson
even
if
he
had
objected
during
that
colloquy.
the
government
seems
to
argue
that
he
was
given
many
opportunities.
in
a
case
called
riley
v.
state,
the
georgia
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
once
trial
has
commenced
and
the
jury
has
been
sworn,
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
counsel
to
then
rely
on
a
batson
claim
to
avail
him
of
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
prosecutor's
use
of
peremptory
challenges
in
a
racially
discriminatory
way.
we
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
all
of
these
facts,
that
the
government
has
not
been
able
to
sustain
its
burden.
moreover,
no
one
has
been
treated
like
ford
in
georgia.
the
government
refers
to
various
cases
decided
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
after
batson
and
before
mr.
ford's
case
was
decided.
in
all
of
those
cases
they
are
distinguishable,
as
we
submit,
and
more
importantly,
all
of
those
cases
follow
mr.
ford's
actual
conviction.
the
closest
case
that
the
government
cites
is
child
v.
state,
decided
by
the
georgia
supreme
court,
but
mr.
childs
raised
the
issue
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
he
didn't
raise
it
in
a
pretrial
motion.
he
didn't
raise
it
after
the
jury
had
been
selected.
and
moreover,
the
reference
to
sparks,
we
submit,
is
unavailing.
additionally,
we
would
submit
that
this
court
in
griffith
made
clear
and,
for
whatever
reasons,
decided
that
when
these
cases
are
remanded,
if
it's
on
direct
review,
that
those
parties
who
establish
batson's
claims
should
have
the
opportunity
for
redress
in
the
lower
courts.
and
we
submit
that
griffith
certainly
supports
that
proposition,
and
that
this
court
should
consider
exactly
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
in
denying
relief
for
mr.
ford
in
this
case
before
the
georgia
supreme
court.
finally,
what
we
ask
the
court
to
do
as
you
think
about
this
case,
mr.
ford's
case
is
unique
for
a
number
of
respects.
the
first
is
that
mr.
ford,
unlike
any
other
case
that
we
have
been
able
to
find,
filed
a
motion
pretrial.
it's
clear
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
the
georgia
trial
courts
at
that
time
could
have
outlined
procedures
saying
there
are
various
reasons
by
counsel
should
file
these
motions
pretrial,
as
opposed
to
during
trial.
one
obvious
reason
would
be
if
you
file
it
pretrial
and
you
give
notice
to
the
prosecutor,
you
won't
be
sandbagging
him.
and
it's
clear
in
this
case
there
is
absolutely
no
argument
to
justify
that
the
prosecutor,
the
court,
or
anyone
was
sandbagged.
if
there
is
any
sandbagging,
the
sandbagging
occurs
when
the
government
and
the
court...
the
georgia
supreme
court
for
the
first
time
announces
a
rule
and
applies
it
to
mr.
ford,
when
in
fact
he
had
no
opportunity
to
remedy
it.
the
second
point,
as
equally
significant,
is
that
the
georgia
supreme
court,
if
they
had
thought
about
procedures,
could
very
well
have
said
don't
raise
these
issues
pretrial,
but
raise
them
after
the
jury
has
been
selected,
because
we
don't
want
to
inject
race
into
the
case
until
it's
significant.
that
might
have
been
a
procedure,
whatever
the
georgia
supreme
court
might
have
done,
or
whatever
rules
might
have
been
existence.
that
is
fine.
there
were
no
clear
rules
in
existence.
to
the
extent
that
they
were,
counsel
complied
with
them.
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
ruling
ignored
its
own
precedent
and
created
a
whole
new
ruling
for
counsel.
and
we
would
submit
that
in
light
of
these
new
guidelines
being
applied
to
mr.
ford
in
these
circumstances,
that
the
court
should
rule
in
mr.
ford's
favor
and
remand
this
case
to
the
georgia
supreme
court,
instructing
that
court
to
ask
the
trial
court
to
have
a
hearing
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
batson
v.
kentucky.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
no,
i...
i
would
just
simply
ask
the
court
to,
in
light
of
this
record,
to
remand
the
case.
and
then
the
georgia
supreme
court
could
actually
apply
batson
the
way
this
court
intended
it
to
be
applied.
but
not
to--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--that
is
right.
right.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
for
the
purpose
of
requiring
georgia
to
reach
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
it
would
be
an
extension
under
these
circumstances,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
submit
that
on
this
record
what
you
would
actually
do,
as
we've
argued
before,
is
to
simply,
in
light
of
the
failure
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
to
really
follow
your
remand,
to
create
for
the
first
time
a
claim
that
has
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground,
to
say
that
there
is
no...
all
you
have
to
decide
in
this
case
is
that
there
really
was
no
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
in
existence.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
right.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
i,
i
think...
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that.
i
think
you
have
enough
in
this
record.
i
think
what
you
do
have
is
the
fact
that
counsel
had
made
an
objection
to
the
prosecutor's
specific
use,
that
in
fact
the
prosecutor
on
the
record,
without
dispute,
used
9
out
of
10
peremptory
challenges
to
strike
black
jurors.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
i
guess
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
the
court
is
asking,
in
light
of
what
batson
now
requires,
whether
you
can
go
and
decide
the
entire
issue.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
to
respond
and
rebut.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
reason
that
i
think
the
record
is
so
clear,
that
the
record
is
adequately
preserved,
the
prosecutor
at
the
time
of
the
colloquy
during
trial
was
prepared
to
give
reasons,
and
present
to
the
court...
may
i
give
reasons,
do
i
need
to
give
reasons
for
my
strikes.
so
it
goes
beyond
that
to
say
that
there
was
no
sandbagging,
there
was
no
effort
to
deny
the
prosecutor
of
making
that
claim.
and
in
fact
we
submit
that,
on
this
entire
record,
that
this
case
could
be
remanded
and
the
appropriate
batson--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--i
think
it
certainly
is
sufficient
to
at
least
raise
the
issue,
and
certainly
in
circumstances
like
this,
justice
stevens,
where
it
is
clear
that
counsel,
based
on
the
court's
earlier
ruling,
was
not
allowed
to
object
to
it
and
make
whatever
arguments
and
make
the
prosecutor
explain.
i
think
it's
significant
that
exactly
what
mr.
ford's
counsel
anticipated
happen,
happened.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that's
true.
that's
true,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
right.
and
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
on
both
instances
does
not
deny
that
that
was
enough
for
an
inquiry,
but
said
in
fact
it
was
the
way
in
which
the
claim
was
made,
and
it
wasn't
preserved
again
after
the
pretrial
motion.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
that
certainly
is
what
i
would
like
to
see
happen,
if
this
court
would
entertain
that,
particularly
in
light
of
this
record.
i
can
see
the
court
not
having
to
go
that
far,
to
remand
it,
but
i
certainly
would
not
oppose
such
a--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
--i
think
this
court...
i
think
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
the
rules
it
outlined
in
sparks
are
totally
appropriate,
and
it
clearly
was
a
clear
rule,
a
new
rule.
the
question
was
applying
it
to
mr.
ford.
it's
not
the
rule.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
rule.
the
rule
gives
adequate
notice,
the
procedures
are
crystal
clear,
and
any
litigant
after
sparks
is
clearly
on
notice.
but
mr.
ford
is
in
a
very
different
posture.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
i
think
that...
no,
no.
i'm
saying
the
georgia
supreme
court
explicitly
said
that
sparks
would
be
prospective.
i'm
not
saying
that
they
should
all
be
prospective,
but
i'm
saying
the
georgia
supreme
court,
under
its
own
state
law,
decided
that
this
rule
should
be
applied
prospectively.
and
for
a
good
reason.
i
think
they
had
no
other
procedures
in
the
past.
i
think
they
were
saying
in
light
of
what
we
have,
in
light
of
what
we've
done,
we
have
to
treat
this
differently,
we
have
to
treat
it
prospectively.
and
i
think
that's
the
fair
thing
to
do.
georgia
was
attempting
to
do,
i
think,
in
sparks
and
riley,
what
every
other
court
has
been
trying
to
do
since
swain,
that
is
interpret
those
cases,
interpret
batson,
in
a
way
that
is
fair
to
all
litigants.
and
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case
is
georgia
for
the
first
time
trying
to
do
that
in
a
reasonable
way,
but
when
it
comes
to
mr.
ford,
ignoring
his
really,
i
think,
impressive
efforts
to
make
the
point
clearly
on
the
record
below.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
it
was
not
applied
to
him,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
it's
the
most
incredible
set
of
circumstances
that
not
only
was
it
not
applied
to
him,
the
court
says
it's
prospective,
it
says
that
we
had
no
guidelines
before,
but
sparks
gets
the
benefit
of
it.
and
how
in
the
world
can
mr.
ford
be
denied
that
benefit
in
light
of
the
fact
that
he
had
done
more
than
sparks,
and
had
done
more
than
many
other
cases
cited
by
the
government.
and
we
don't
contend,
and
it's
not
central
to
our
argument,
that
mr.
ford
had
to
make
additional
arguments,
as
we
state
in
our
brief.
i
concede
now
that
that
is
not
central
to
this
case,
and
it
is
not
really
well
preserved
in
this
record,
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
decided
against
us
on
that
issue.
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
counsel
objected
at
the
earliest
opportunity.
counsel's
objection
was
clear.
the
georgia
supreme
court
treated
us
clear.
the
prosecutor
and
judge
viewed
it
as
clear.
and
now
the
georgia
supreme
court,
for
the
first
time,
is
saying
sorry,
mr.
ford,
you
lose.
we
think
that
is
an
inappropriate
result
and
we
urge
this
court
to
so
find
it.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
there
are
not
additional
questions.
mr.
charles
j.
ogletree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
only
three
points
i
wish
to
make.
in
this
particular
case,
when
this
case
was
presented
to
the
georgia
supreme
court,
the
georgia
supreme
court
clearly
concluded
that
a
proper
swain
claim
had
been
made.
at
page
51
of
the
joint
appendix
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
the
remand
characterizes
the
motion
as
properly
made
under
swain,
and
in
fact,
at
page
55
of
the
joint
appendix,
when
the
georgia
supreme
court
had
the
remand,
makes
clear
that
swain's
motion...
that
ford's
motion
under
swain,
having
been
decided
adversely
to
him
on
appeal,
cannot
be
reviewed
in
this
proceeding.
i
think
first
of
all
it
establishes
that
swain
had
been
made
properly.
and
more
importantly,
it
seems
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
ignoring
that...
this
court's
remand.
it
is
saying
in
effect
we
are
not
going
to
review
this
case
in
light
of
what
the
court
requested
that
we
do.
sparks,
again,
we
say
is
significant
in
that
sparks
could
not
have
complied
and
did
not
comply
with
the
procedure
announced
in
sparks.
sparks'
objection
did
not
occur
until
after
the
jury
was
selected,
sworn,
the
judge
had
given
preliminary
instructions
to
the
jury.
so
in
terms
of
the
rule,
he
would
not
have
made
it.
and
in
fact
the
government
at
this
point
is
contending
that
sparks
adequately
made
a
showing,
and
we
submit
that
he
did
not.
moreover,
this
court,
we
submit,
can
say
that
the
prosecutor's
exercise
of
9
out
of
10
peremptory
strikes
to
strike
the
black
jurors
is
a
prima
facie
case,
and
without
rebuttal
by
the
state
in
this
case,
that
it
would
be
an
adequate
basis
for
mr.
ford
to
prevail.
finally,
we
would
submit
that,
on
this
record,
that
it
shows
that
this
court,
looking
at
ford,
has
yet
another
opportunity
to
correct
much
of
the
injustice
that
has
occurred
and
the
whole
line
of
racial
discrimination
in
jury
selection
procedures.
from
strauder
through
swain
and
batson
and
griffith,
this
court
has
consistently
tried
to
prevent
any
form
of
discrimination
preventing
defendants
from
having
fair
trials,
and
preventing
prosecutors
from
excluding...
excusing
citizens
from
their
right
to
serve
as
jurors.
that
principle
was
clearly
stated
in
strauder.
it
is
just
as
clear
in
batson.
and
we
submit
that
mr.
ford,
in
his
unique
circumstances,
should
not
be
denied
the
opportunity
to
submit
to
this
court
an
argument
that
batson
should
be
applied.
and
we
urge
the
court,
in
light
of
this
record
and
in
light
of
the
arguments
today,
to
find
as
mr.
ford
has
urged
in
his
brief.
thank
you.
