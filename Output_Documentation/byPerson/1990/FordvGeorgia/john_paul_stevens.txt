justice
stevens
mr.
ogletree,
before
you
do
get
to
the
merits,
what...
what...
what
reliance
upon
swain
by
the
prosecution
are
you
referring
to?
where
is
that
in
the--
justice
stevens
mr.
ogletree,
at
any
time
in
these
proceedings,
has
either
any
georgia
judge
or
a
georgia
prosecutor
taken
the
position
that
you
waived
the
claim
because
you
only
argued
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
stevens
no,
but
this
is
just
brand
new
up
here.
justice
stevens
but
even,
even
then
they
didn't
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
confusion
between
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
stevens
it
was
a
procedural
failure
to
make
a
motion
at
the
time
they
decided
that
it
should
have
been
made.
justice
stevens
mr.
ogletree,
are
you
implicitly
arguing,
this
is
kind
of
a
follow-up
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
when
the
record
merely
shows
that
9
out
of
10
eligible
blacks
were
struck
from
the
jury,
that
is
sufficient
to
raise
a
batson
issue
which
requires
the
explanation?
justice
stevens
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
supposing
you
made
the
same
motion
and
all
the
rest,
but
the
record
also
showed
that
there
were
10
blacks
on
the
panel,
and
they
all
got
on
the
petit
jury.
we
wouldn't
send
it
back
then,
i
don't
think.
justice
stevens
so
i
think
inevitably
we
have
to
be
considering
whether
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
9
out
of
10
eligible
jurors
were
stricken
and
they
are
all
of
the
same
race,
that
that
at
least
raises
enough
for
further
inquiry.
justice
stevens
well,
should
we
say
here
that
there
was
enough
for
an
inquiry,
and
then
remand
it
for
such
further
proceedings
as
may
be
consistent
with
that
finding?
justice
stevens
mr.
ogletree,
do
you
say
that
sparks,
in
his
case
he,
the
rule
was
not
applied
to
him?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
one
of
the
things
we
are
always
concerned
about
in
procedural
bar
is
to
be
sure
the
judge...
i
think
perhaps
this
is
what
justice
blackmun
had
in
mind,
to
give
the
judge
a
fair
opportunity
to
avoid
the
possible
error.
and
on
pages
11
and
12
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
judge
explained
rather
carefully
why
he
denied
the
motion,
that
he
was
familiar
with
other
trials
where
blacks
had
not
been
stricken,
and
the
like.
he
apparently
felt
there
was
inability
to
prove
a
pattern
of
this
kind
of
strike.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
had
the
motion
been
made
when
you
say
it
should
have
been
made,
those
same
reasons
would
have
compelled
him
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
are
you
suggesting
that
he
might
have
ruled
differently
if
the
motion
had
been
made
a
second
time?
justice
stevens
ms.
smith,
i
didn't
realize
this
before,
but
your
opponent
says
that
sparks
was
not
procedurally
defaulted.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
now,
what
did
he
do
that
this,
this
litigant
did
not
do?
justice
stevens
i
see.
it's
the
motion
for
mistrial
that
preserved
it
for
him.
