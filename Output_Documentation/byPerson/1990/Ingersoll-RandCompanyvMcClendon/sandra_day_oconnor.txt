justice
o'connor
mr.
hurd,
under
the
federal
cause
of
action
that
you
say
would
exist
under
the
circumstances
inquired
about
by
justice
stevens,
would
there
be
any
right
to
punitive
damages?
justice
o'connor
what
about
attorneys'
fees?
justice
o'connor
mr.
tavormina,
do
you
agree
that
mr.
mcclendon
also
had
a
cause
of
action
under
erisa,
section
510,
to
compel
reinstatement
or
payment
of
the
benefits?
justice
o'connor
well,
since
he
did
have
a
cause
of
action,
doesn't
that
indicate
that
the
cause
of
action
relates
to
the
terms
of
the
plan?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
in
pilot
life
the
court
held
that
section
502
of
erisa
was
the
exclusive
mechanism
for
enforcement
of
obligations
just
like
this
one.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
citing
a
companywide
reduction
in
force,
the
petitioner,
ingersoll-rand,
fired
the
respondent,
mcclendon,
shortly
before
his
tenth
year
with
the
company.
mcclendon
then
filed
a
wrongful
discharge
action
in
state
court
in
texas
alleging
that
a
principal
reason
for
his
termination
was
the
company's
desire
to
avoid
contributing
to
his
pension
fund.
the
state
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
employer.
the
texas
supreme
court
reversed
and
remanded
for
trial
holding
that
the
public
policy
of
protecting
employee's
interest
in
their
pension
plans
warranted
recognition
of
a
state
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
discharge
to
avoid
pension
obligations.
the
texas
court
rejected
the
argument
that
such
a
cause
of
action
is
preempted
by
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974,
a
federal
act
known
as
erisa.
the
court
reasoned
that
mcclendon
was
not
seeking
lost
pension
benefits,
but
rather
future
lost
wages
recovery
from
mental
anguish
and
punitive
damages.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
the
texas
cause
of
action
is
preempted
under
erisa.
a
majority
of
the
court
holds
that
the
cause
of
action
is
expressly
preempted
by
section
514(a)
which
broadly
provides
that
erisa
supersedes
all
state
laws,
including
decisions
having
the
effect
of
loss
that
relate
to
covered
employee
benefit
plans.
because
the
existence
of
a
plan
is
a
critical
factor
in
establishing
liability
in
the
state
cause
of
action
and
the
trial
court's
inquiry
must
be
directed
to
the
plan,
this
judicially
created
cause
of
action
in
texas
relates
to
an
erisa
plan
and
is
therefore,
preempted
under
section
514(a).
a
unanimous
court
also
concludes
that
the
texas
cause
of
action
is
preempted
as
well
because
it
conflicts
directly
with
section
510
of
erisa
which
prohibits
the
discharge
of
a
plan
participant
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
his
attainment
of
any
right
under
the
plan.
by
its
own
terms,
section
510
protects
plan
participants
from
termination
motivated
by
an
employer's
desire
to
prevent
a
pension
from
vesting;
the
precise
purpose
of
the
cause
of
action
recognized
by
the
texas
supreme
court.
the
judgment
of
the
texas
supreme
court
is
reversed.
justice
marshall,
justice
blackmun,
and
justice
stevens
have
joined
only
parts
1
and
2b
of
the
opinion.
