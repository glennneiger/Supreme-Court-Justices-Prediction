mr.
john
w.
tavormina
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court:
102
years
ago,
the
texas
supreme
court
came
down
with
the
eastline
decision
which
held
unequivocally,
without
exception,
any
employer
could
terminate
any
employee
for
no
reason
at
all...
the
employment-at-will
doctrine,
or
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
fire-at-will
doctrine.
over
the
last
century,
the
texas
court
has
changed
and
developed
that
law
to
take
its
harsh
remedies
and
look
at
those
harsh
remedies
in
light
of
the
realities
of
today's
environment.
the
texas
supreme
court
has
imposed
some
restrictions
on
that
harsh
employment-at-will
doctrine.
they
have
imposed
that
if
the
parties
contract
an
employment,
a
for
cause
provision
will
be
inferred
in
all
the
contracts.
very
recently,
the
texas
supreme
court,
based
on
the
public
policy
of
the
state,
said,
if
an
employee
is
fired
for
refusing
to
commit
a
crime,
well,
we
can't
let
the
employment-at-will
doctrine
prevent
a
cause
of
action
because
our
state
public
policy
warrants,
it
mandates,
that
we
can't
let
that
wrong
go
without
redress,
and
the
court
carved
out
another
exception
to
the
employment-at-will
doctrine
and
said,
if
you
can
prove
that
the
reason
this
employee
was
terminated
was
because
he
failed
to
commit
a
crime,
he
will
have,
or
she
will
have,
a
state
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
termination.
in
this
case,
the
mcclendon
case,
the
court
again
looked
at
the
realities
of
today's
employment
setting.
pension
benefits,
welfare
benefits,
and
health
plans
are...
are
so
much
more
an
essential
element
of
our
employment
packages
today
than
they
were
in
1988,
and
the
court
said,
we
have
a
public
policy.
we
have
an
interest
in
protecting
our
employees,
our
men
and
women,
with
respect
to
their
pension
benefits,
and
therefore,
because
of
our
public
policy,
if
you
prove
that
a
man
or
a
woman
is
fired
for
the
principal
reason
of
the
employer
trying
to
avoid
pension
obligations,
then
that
person
has
a
state
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
your
honor,
he
did
have
a
cause
of
action
under
erisa
to
compel
that.
when
the
suit
was
first
filed,
he
also
had
the
cause
of
action
for
the
processing
of
a
claim
for
his
retirement
benefits
which
he
did
not
get.
once
he
received
those
benefits,
from
that
point
on,
the
court...
the
case
took
the
posture
of
simply
a
wrongful
termination
case.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not
indicate
it
relates
to
the
plan.
it
relates
to
the
employer's
motivation
for
terminating
the
employment.
it
does
not
relate
at
all
to
the
terms
or
conditions
of
a
plan.
you
have...
if
you
take
a
step
back,
what
do
we
have?
we
have
a
state
law
in
a
traditionally
regulated
area,
wrongful
employment
termination.
all
states
have
a
right
to
do
that,
and
the
state
of
texas
has
said,
this
is
a
wrong
for
which
an
employee
can
sue
for
wrongful
termination.
then
we
have
erisa.
what
was
the
purpose
of
erisa?
erisa
was...
ah,
passed
to
promote
the
interests
of
employees
in
pension
plans
and
in
benefit
plans.
it
was--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--no,
your
honor,
but
the
key
element
of
the
preemption
provisions
were
to
ensure
uniformity
to
the
employers
to
avoid
different
processing
and
different
procedures
in
different
states,
if
they
operated
across
state
lines.
that
was
the
key
element
of
the
preemption
provision,
and
this
cause
of
action
created
by
the
texas
supreme
court
does
absolutely
nothing
to
the
uniformity
of
the
structure
of
erisa
plans.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
your
honor,
you're
exactly
right,
but
pilot
life
was
a
holding
where
the
court
said,
all
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
way
a
claim
should
have
been
processed
under
a
specific
plan.
we're...
the
employee
is
basically
saying
the
employer
did
not
process
the
claim
properly.
that
is
not
the
claim
here.
we
are
not
claiming
any
pension
benefits
or
any
pension
rights.
we
are
not
claiming
anything
at
all
under
the
plan
itself.
going
back
to
the
justice's
contract
example
for
just
a
second,
if
i
understand
what
the
petitioner
and
the
government
are
arguing,
if
we
are
to
let
the
provision
in
erisa
control
the
damages,
then
wouldn't
every
wrongful
termination
suit
that
is
effected
in
any
way...
if
part
of
the
element
of
damages
is,
well,
what
did
i
lose?
i
lost
my
salary,
but
i
lost
my
pension,
for
whatever
reason...
contract
or
no
contract.
would
that
mean
that
in
every
state,
in
every
cause
of
action,
if
an
employee
sues
for
everything
that
he
or
she
lost
by
the
termination...
under
their
rationale,
wouldn't
every
single
employment
case
then
automatically
be
removed
to
federal
court?
don't
most
of
us
have
pensions
that
are
going
to
vest,
or
have
vested,
and
if--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--well,
your
honor,
but
the
way--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--but
under
the
contract
example,
if
the
contract
included
wages...
i'm
going
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
money,
plus
i'm
going
to
vest
you
in
20
years...
and
the
contract
was
then
terminated
after
19
years...
breach
of
contract
action,
wrongful
termination
action,
what
are
your
elements
of
damages?
one
of
them
is
my
pension.
i
didn't
get
it.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
sir,
it's
different,
but
if
you
look
at
the
court's
decision
in
english
v.
ge,
that
was
the
energy
reorganization
act
that
was
involved
in
that
case.
that
act
had
a
similar
provision.
that
was
the
case
where
a
woman
was
fired.
she
had
reported
several
times
to
ge
that
radioactive
waste
had
not
been
cleaned
up
properly,
and
her
warnings
were
ignored,
and
she
put
a
big
piece
of
red
tape
around
it
to
show
how
absurd
things
were
getting,
to
point
out
that
things
weren't
being
done
in
the
workplace
for
safety,
and
the
employer
wound
up
firing
her
for
that.
well,
if
you
look
at
that
cause,
which
the
court
held
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
was
not
preempted--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--no...
well,
your
honor,
you
had...
you
didn't
have
an
express
preemption
provision,
but
you
had
two
very
similar
enforcement
statutes,
one
that
said
you
couldn't
discriminate
or
discharge
an
employee,
and
the
other
that
gave
specific
remedies
for
any
action
under
that--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--your
honor,
i
agree
with
that,
but
again,
you
have
the
state
law
and
you
have
the
preemption
opinion...
preemption
provision,
which,
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
state,
it
says,
"any
regulatory
agency
or
any
legislative
agency
that
purports,
either
directly
or
indirectly,
to
regulate
the
terms
or
conditions
of
a
pension
plan.
"
what
does
this
state
law
do
to
regulate,
directly
or
indirectly,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
any
pension
plan
at
all?
it
is
a
broad
preemption
statute,
but
if
you
look
at
it,
this
state
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
terms
and
conditions
of
ingersoll-rand's
pension
plan.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
uniformity
of
their
pension
plan.
it
only
has
to
do
with,
why
did
they
terminate
them,
and
the
point
raised,
why
wasn't
it
raised
by
petitioner
in
the
lower
court
if
it
was
so
obvious,
was
because
it's
a
different
cause
of
action.
they're
going...
we're
looking
to
the
motivation.
why
were
they
terminated?
they
use
an
example,
petitioner
does
in
its
brief,
about,
well,
we're
going
to...
we
would
have
to
introduce
evidence
at
trial
to
show
the
complicated
formula
for
vesting.
well,
i
think
that
proves
that
there
is
no
preemption
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
well,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
relate--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--it
doesn't
relate
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
an
erisa
plan,
and
that's
what
preemption
is
supposed
to
go
to.
preemption
was
made
so
there
could
be
a
uniform
scheme
that
the
employers
could
use
and
rely
upon.
it
wasn't
so
you
can
take
away
causes
of
action,
and
there
are
many
cases...
english
v.
ge
is
one,
but
there
are
other
cases
where
this
court
has
held
that
just
because
a
state
court
imposes
additional
liability,
or
further
liability
than
a
federal
action,
that
is
not
enough
to
preempt.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
also
go
back
to
the
language
of
the
definition
of
state,
where
it
says,
"regulates
directly
or
indirectly
the
terms
or
conditions
of
a
pension
plan.
"
if
you
go
back
to
the
original
premise,
you
have
the
state
law
and
you
have
a
federal
act
which
was
meant
to
protect
the
interest
of
employees
and
protect
them
from
things
like
fraud
and
misappropriation,
and
then
congress
said,
but
we...
we
have
to
give
something
to
the
employers,
and
we're
going
to
let
them
have
a
uniform
plan.
now,
how
is
that
affected
by
a
state
cause
of
action?
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--when
you
say,
whether
it
relates
to
the
plan,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
a
plan,
or
the
administration
of
a
plan
versus
a
cause
of
action
for
an
employer's
motivation.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
because
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
majority
opinion,
for
instance,
in
the
halifax
case,
where
the
plant
closing
law
came
down
from
the
state,
and
they
said
so
many
plants
have
been
closing
in
maine,
if
an
employer
closes
a
plant
we're
going
to
demand
a
one-time
severance
payment.
the
court
said
well,
we're
not...
anything...
severance
relates
to
some
kind
of
employee
benefits,
but
they
said,
well
look
at
the
benefits,
not...
there's
a
difference
between
employee
benefits
and
an
employee
benefit
plan.
the
court
made
that
distinction.
now,
the
dissent
in
that
case
said,
we're
dissenting...
as
i
understood
it,
we're
dissenting
because
we
think
that
the
state
of
maine
actually
is
creating
a
pension
plan,
or
a
form
of
pension
plan,
so
the
court
concentrated
on
that
in
its
analysis
as
well,
and
here,
in
the
state
of
texas,
we
don't
even
come
as
close
as
fort
halifax.
we
don't
even
have
something
that
could
even
look
like
a
plan,
or
any
terms
and
conditions
of
a
plan.
all
we
have
is
the
motivation.
what
was
the
motivation
for
someone
to
go
ahead
and
terminate?
finally,
i
want
to...
i
would
like
to
just
talk
about
the
issue
of
damages.
just
because
there
is
a
provision
for
certain
damages
in
the
erisa
statute
does
not
preclude
a
state
cause
of
action
in
a
traditionally
state-regulated
field
from
imposing
additional
damages,
whether
they
be
punitive
damages,
or
whether
they
be
mental
anguish.
the
issue
of
punitive
damages
was
really
not
addressed
by
the
texas
supreme
court,
and
one
of
the
justices
said
it
was
an
open
question,
but
there
are
several
cases
from
this
court,
including
an
antitrust
case,
which
was
california
v.
arc
america,
where
this
court
said
that
just
because
a
state
cause
of
action
gives
further
liability,
or
additional
liability,
to
a
cause
of
action
similar
to
the
federal
cause
of
action,
that's
not
enough
for
preemption,
and
that
case...
as
well,
going
back
to
the
halifax
case...
this
court
has
said,
well,
is
there
any
conflict?
is
there
a
conflict
with
erisa
with
this
cause
of
action?
there
is
no
conflict.
it's
consistent,
and
just
as
in
fort
halifax,
where
the
court
said,
if
it's
consistent
and
there's
no
conflict,
we're
going
to
let
the
state's
public
policy--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
again
just
go
to
the
court's
opinions
in
silkwood,
for
instance,
where
the
court
said
that
punitive
damages,
or
the
prospect
of
punitive
damages--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--well,
your
honor,
you
have
the
plan,
and
then
you
have
the
employer,
and
this
highlights,
again,
the
difference
between
the
two.
it's
the
employer's
conduct,
the
employer's
motivation--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--well,
your
honor,
that's
true,
and
hopefully
that
will
make
employers
look
at
it
more
closely
and
focus
on
not
terminating
someone's
employment
whether
it
be
5,
10,
15,
30,
40
years,
and
not...
not
terminate
that
person's
employment
for
the
principal
reason
of
avoiding
pension
obligations.
yes,
it
is
a
serious
remedy,
but
it's
a
serious
wrong
that
needs
to
be
remedied.
there--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
also,
i
don't
know
for
sure
if
erisa
has
excluded
the
idea,
or
this
thing
of
punitive
damages.
i...
you
know
better
than
i
on
that
point,
but
i
can't
answer
that
question,
so--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--i
don't
know
if
that's
ever
been
ruled
upon.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
would
you,
or
did
we?
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
not
under
erisa.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
well,
your
honor,
if
we
use
that
logic,
then
we're
basically
saying
that
because
erisa
limits
the
damages...
because
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
there's
nothing
conflicting
about
the
cause
of
action.
there
is
a
cause
of
action
in
erisa,
and
there
is
now,
at
least
at
present,
a
state
cause
of
action
in
texas.
so
then
we'd
be
saying
that
the
reason
that
erisa
is
preferred
is
because
it
has,
or
might
have,
less
damages--
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
--than
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
your
honor,
i...
that
could
have
been
something
considered.
i
don't
remember
seeing
it
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
john
w.
tavormina
thank
you.
