justice
stevens
mr.
hurd,
let
me
just
ask
you
a
question
if
i
may.
this
is
a
case
in
which,
as
i
understand
it,
the
texas
court
said
that
because
your
opponent's
client
was
terminated
allegedly
in
order
to
escape
a
pension
fund
liability
that
that's...
that
erisa
preemption
applies.
this
exclusive
remedy
for
that
kind
of
termination
is
federal.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
what
if
they
had
had
a
written
contract.
supposing
a
man
had...
an
executive
had
a
20-year
written
contract
that
guaranteed
him
at
the
end
of
20
years
participation
in
the
pension
fund,
maybe
a
car
when
he
leaves
the
company
and
two
or
three
other
things,
and
in
the
19th
year
they
fired
him
in
breach
of
the
written
contract,
and
he
was
able
to
at
least
allege
and...
and
prove
that
the
reason
they
did
it,
they
wanted
to
escape
their
pension
liability.
would
he
have
any
cause
of
action
in
state
court
for
any
percent...
part
of
the
salary
he
didn't
get
for
his
19th
year
and
so
forth?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
even
if
his
damages
that
he
seeks
are
the
salary
for
the
19th
year...
the
20th
year
of
the
contract?
justice
stevens
would
he
have
a
remedy
for
those
damages
in...
in
federal
court?
justice
stevens
and
that
state
rule
of
law,
as
you
interpret,
relates
to
the
plan?
justice
stevens
may
i
push
that
just
a
step
further?
supposing
he
doesn't
allege
the
reason;
he
just
alleges
the
written
contract.
he
was
ready,
willing
and
able
to
perform
and
they
fired
him
without
just
cause,
period.
and
then
in
defense
they
come
in
and
say
the
real
reason
we
did
it
was
this...
they
go
to
state
law,
and
they
get
ready
to
go
to
the
jury,
but
their
defense
is
in
state
cause
of
action
the
real
reason
we
did
it
is
we
didn't
want
to
pay
him
a
pension.
what
do
you
do
with
that
case
if
you're
a
state
judge?
justice
stevens
if
it
comes
out
on
discovery
and
he
then
says
i
didn't
know
what
the
reason
was
but
now
i
realize
the
real
reason
was
they
wanted
to
save
money
on
the
pension,
then
his
case
goes
out
the
window
as
soon
as
he
finds
that
out?
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
what
about
my...
what
about
my
breach
of
contract
case?
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
on
that
one?
justice
stevens
but
in
my
hypothetical,
if
the
plaintiff
proves
the
breach
in
the
contract
but
fails
to
prove
that
the
reason
was
to
terminate,
you
know,
get
him
out
of
the
pension
but,
rather,
they
just...
it
was
other...
otherwise
a
breach
of
the
contract
so
that
the
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
would
no
longer
survive,
there
would
be,
i
take
it,
ancillary
jurisdiction
to
grant
relief
on
a
state
law
claim
even
though
it
had
been
preempted?
justice
stevens
so
that
preemption
is
kind
of
an
on
and
off
thing?
it's
preempted
until
you
decide
the
merits
of
the
erisa
claim,
and
if
you
decide
the
merits
of
the
erisa
theory
adversely
to
the
plaintiff,
then
the
preemption
ceases
and
it's
sort
of
a
springing
use
and
the
state
law
cause
of
action
revives?
justice
stevens
of
course,
this
is
a
remedy
against
the
employer,
not
against
the
client.
justice
stevens
nothing
in
that
opinion
says
anything
about
preemption.
justice
stevens
that's
all
a
strong
argument
why
you
need
a
federal
remedy.
nobody's
disputing
that.
the
question
is
whether
the
existence
of
the
federal
remedy
precludes
any
kind
of
state
supplementary
remedy.
justice
stevens
why
does
it
show
that?
why
does
it
show
that
it
relates,
too,
within
the
meaning
of
the
preemption
provisions?
i
just
don't
follow
that.
justice
stevens
it's
a
hard
argument,
yeah.
it's
a
different
argument.
i
don't
see
why
the
fact
that
it's
an
important
remedy,
an
important
part
of
the
statute,
necessarily
means
that
this
particular
state
law
cause
of
action
is
a
law
relating
to
a
plan.
it's
relating
to
a
way
of
getting
a
remedy
when
you've
been
discharged
for
an
impermissible
federal
reason.
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
there
for
a
moment?
you
say
there's
no
conflict.
is
it
not
possible
that
a
very
large
punitive
damages
award
against
employers
who
are
funding
their
own
plans
could
jeopardize
the
safety
of
the
financial
soundness
of
the
plan
and
that
there
is
a
federal
interest
in
maintaining
the
financial
soundness
which
might
be
inconsistent
with
awards
of...
of
punitive
damages?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
there,
you
didn't
have
a
federal
interest
in
maintaining
the
financial
stability
of
the
employer.
here
you
have
a
financial...
a
federal
interest
in
maintaining
the
soundness
and
the...
the
fiscal
integrity
of...
ah,
employer-financed
plans.
justice
stevens
it's
his
conduct,
but
that
conduct
could
rub
off
on
a
plan
if
he's
responsible
there.
we've
had
cases
in
which
the
employers
go
bankrupt,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
therefore
the
plan
fails
and
you've
got
to
get
involved
in
all
this
insurance,
and
so
forth.
justice
stevens
all
i'm
suggesting
is,
there
is
a
federal
interest
in...
it
may
not
be
sufficient
to
prevail,
but
there's
at
least
a
federal
interest
which
would
support
an
argument
against
punitive
damages
in
order
to
maintain
the
kind
of
balance
that
you've
got
in
erisa
that
might
not
necessarily
be
available
in
the
state
system.
justice
stevens
none
of
us
knows,
yet.
justice
stevens
may...
may
i
just
ask
this
one
question?
am
i
correct
that
the
federal
claim
could
be
brought
in
a
state
court,
that
would
be
based
on
a
federal...
based
on
the
federal
cause
of
action?
justice
stevens
it
could
not?
justice
stevens
there's
something
in
the
conference
report
that's
quoted
that
says
that
whether
it's
brought
in
state
or
federal
court,
it's
still
a
federal
cause
of
action.
i
don't--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
justice
stevens
rather
than
a
claim
of
this
kind.
justice
stevens
is
federal
law,
right.
