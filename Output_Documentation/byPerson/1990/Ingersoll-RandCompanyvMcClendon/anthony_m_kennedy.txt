justice
kennedy
counsel,
what...
what
would
happen
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
if
there
were
three
or
four
independent
reasons
given
for
the
termination?
one,
they
tried...
they
terminated
early
to
avoid
having
to
pay
the
pension
benefits.
two,
because
he
was
allegedly
infringing
on...
ah,
exclusive
sales
territory
that
the
contract
promised
him.
and
any
number
of
different
reasons
are
usually
alleged
in
these
wrongful
discharge
cases.
if...
if
one
of
them
is
the
erisa
reason,
does
that
preempt
the
whole
cause
of
action?
justice
kennedy
what
you
say...
if...
you
said...
if
one
of
the
motivations?
justice
kennedy
and
then
your
view
is
that
the
entire
case
should
have
been
transferred
to
the
united
states
district
court,
and
it
would
have
pendent
jurisdiction
on
the
other
issues?
justice
kennedy
you're...
you're
saying
that
a
cause
of
action
under
510
doesn't
relate
to
erisa?
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
isn't
that...
isn't
that
the
effect
of
your
position?
