suppose
the...
suppose
the
employer
wins
on
that,
that
it...
that
he
didn't
fire
him
for
that
reason.
what
happens
to
the
employee's
state
cause
of
action?
it's
probably...
is
it
to
be
dismissed?
do
you
think
they
should
dismiss
the
state
cause
of
action?
justice
white
well,
he
loses
on
it
because
it
really...
the
employer
really
didn't
interfere
with
plan
benefits.
that's
the
reason
the
employer
wins.
justice
white
so
what...
but
he's
nevertheless
may
have
a
state
claim.
justice
white
yes,
exactly.
exactly.
justice
white
so
how
does
he
protect
himself
while
this
federal
case
is
dismissed,
i
mean
while
the
state
cause
of
action
is
being
dismissed?
can
it
just...
and
you
say
it
can't
continue
to
be
on
file.
justice
white
so
he
should
bring
his
state
law
claims
with
him
in
the
federal
court?
justice
white
but
if...
but
if
the...
but
if
it's
proved
in
the
case
that
the
reason
for
the
assault
was
to
deprive
him
of
pension
benefits,
then
it's
preempted?
is
that
it?
justice
white
even
if
it's
proven
what
the
real
reason
was?
