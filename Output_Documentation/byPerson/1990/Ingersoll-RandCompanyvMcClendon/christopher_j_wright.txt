mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
first
say
that
i...
i
agree
with
what
i
take
to
be
the
ultimate
resolution
of
the
assault
and
wrongful
death
hypothetical
situations.
normally
one
can
prevail
in
a
tort
action
for
assault
or
for
wrongful
death
without
proving
why
you
assaulted
or
killed
the
person,
and,
likewise,
it
is
not
a
defense
in
a
wrongful
death
case
or
in
an
assault
case
to
say
i
did
it
in
order
to
deprive
the
person
of
pension
benefits.
to
the
contrary.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
and...
and
in
the
contract
case,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
question
that
the
person
would
have
a
claim
under
erisa.
now
the
only
thing
that
was...
that
was
left
open,
i
think,
in
the
assault
and...
ah,
wrongful
death
hypothetical
was
i
wouldn't
read
the
word
discriminate,
justice
scalia,
normally...
normally
to
cover
such
extreme
situations;
but
of
course,
you
have
in...
in
a
contract
case
you
would
have
a
claim
under
erisa.
i
might
say--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
firing
him
is
discharging
him,
and
discharging
him
is
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
other
things
in
the
statute
are
expel,
suspend,
discipline
and
discriminate.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i...
i
don't
think
he
would,
probably.
he
certainly
would
in
justice
stevens'--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
assume
that
that's
how
they...
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i...
i
think
that
this
sort
of
thing
happens
all
the
time
in
these
sorts
of
cases,
as...
as
this
one.
the
way
this
one,
i
think,
should
have
been
handled,
he
argued
two
very
different
reasons
for
why
he
was
discharged.
one
was
a
breach
of
contract;
one
was
discharge
to
prevent
the
attainment
of
pension
benefits.
the...
the
contract
action
was
actually
the
focus
of
the
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
the
united
states
would
like
to
emphasize
that
congress
specifically
intended
erisa's
broad
preemption
provision,
section
502,
to
displace
state
law.
in
pilot
life,
this
court
concluded,
and
i
quote,
"the
deliberate
care
with
which
erisa's
civil
enforcement
remedies
were
drafted
and
the
balancing
of
policies
embodied
in
its
choice
of
remedies
argue
strongly
for
the
conclusion
that
erisa's
civil
enforcement
remedies
were
intended
to
be
exclusive.
"
the
court
also
recognized--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--justice
stevens,
section
510
of
erisa
also
establishes
a
remedy
against
employers,
and
it
is
enforceable
under
section
502(a)(3),
one
of
the
six...
one
of
the
six
provisions
that
was
described
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
russell
as
interlocking,
interdependent,
and
interrelated
remedies.
i
believe
you
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
but
the
fact
remains
that
this
court
has
relied
on
the
comprehensive
nature
of
the
six
remedies
considered
as
a
whole.
now
respondent
here
argues
that
his
claim
for
benefits
is...
i'm
sorry,
his
claim
for
interference
with
the
attainment
of
benefits
is
different
than
a
claim
for
benefits,
but
we
think
that
there
are
two
sides
to
the
same
coin,
and
we
don't
think
that
there
is
a
basis,
given
this
court's
statements
in
pilot
life
and
russell,
for
any
distinction
between
a
claim
arising
under
section
502(a)(1)(b),
the
provision
involving
claims
for
benefits,
and
section
502(a)(3),
the
provision
that
allows
for
enforcement
of
section
510.
related
to
this...
ah,
question,
i
might
say,
is...
is
the
suggestion
perhaps
that
section
510
as...
as
a
wrongful
discharge
remedy
is
not
central
to
erisa.
i'd
like
to
say
that,
to
the
contrary,
congress
recognized
and
senator
harkin
explicitly
stated
that
if
employers
could
fire
employees
in
order
to
avoid
the
payment
of
pension
benefits,
then
erisa's
vesting
provisions
which
are
critical
to
the
statute
would
be
worthless.
and
i
think
that
that...
that
makes
sense.
the
first
circuit
in
the
fitzgerald
case
likewise
said
that
section
510
is
essential
to
the
act,
and
we
agree.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
think
it
shows
two
things.
we
think
the
existence
of
section
510
shows
that
congress
clearly
understood
that
a
wrongful
discharge
remedy
relates
to
erisa
and...
and,
hence,
the
state
law
claim
is
preempted
under
514(a).
we
also
agree...
we
also
think
that
consistent
to
the
remedy--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
it's
a
very
broad
preemption
provision.
we
think
the
fact
that
congress
put
it
in
the
heart
of
title
i
of
erisa
shows
that
it's...
it
relates
to
erisa.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
this
particular
state
law
remedy
is,
of
course,
identical
to
the
remedy
congress
provided
in
erisa,
and
we
think
congress
put
that
remedy
in
erisa
because
it
thought
that
it
relates
to
erisa.
and
we
also
think
it
intended
it
to
be
exclusive.
in
addition
to
pilot
life,
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
metropolitan
life
v.
taylor
is
particularly
informative.
in
that
case,
congress
held
in
light
of
erisa's
comprehensive
enforcement
provision
and
its
broad
express
preemption
provision
that
congress
had
so
completely
preempted
the
field
that
any
complaint
raising
a
claim
under
erisa
could
be
removed
to
federal
court
despite
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule.
this
court
recognized
that
this
special
rule
applies
only
under
erisa
section
502(a)
and
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
and
relations
act
but
determined
that
a
special
rule
was
warranted
in
light
of
congress'
especially
thorough
preemption
of
these
two
fields.
respondent
cannot
explain
how
it
can
be
that
congress
has
so
displaced
state
law
that
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
has
no
applicability
here,
and
yet
his
claim
which
is
identical
to
a
claim
that
could
be
raised
under
erisa
is
not
preempted.
in
our
view,
both
provisions,
separately
or
together,
the
comprehensive
enforcement
provision
and
the
broad
express
preemption
provision,
make
clear
that
congress
did
not
leave
room
for
actions
parallel
to
those
enforcing
section
510
of
erisa.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
