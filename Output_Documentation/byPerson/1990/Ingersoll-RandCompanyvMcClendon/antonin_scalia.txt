justice
scalia
mr.
hurd,
suppose
an
employer
induces
him
to
quit
by
threatening
him.
he
sends
some
friends
around
who
say
if
you
don't
quit
we
will
break
your
legs.
and
he
brings
a
cause
of
action
for...
for
assault
against
the
employer.
is...
is
that
precluded?
justice
scalia
well,
the
reason...
the
reason
that
they
want
him
to
quit
is
so
that
he
won't...
he
won't
qualify
for
benefits.
justice
scalia
so...
so
it
is...
it
is,
indeed...
it
fits
within
section
110,
that
they
are
discriminating
against
him
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
becoming
entitled
under
the
plan.
that's
precluded.
you
couldn't
bring
a
state
assault
action.
justice
scalia
no,
this
is...
is
an
assault,
civil
action
for
assault,
tort.
justice
scalia
couldn't
bring
a
civil
action?
justice
scalia
how
about
a
wrongful
death
action?
they...
they
actually
blow
him
away
in
order
to...
a
wrongful
death
action
would
not
lie,
either?
justice
scalia
well,
but
it's
testing
the
principle
of
whether
any
state
law,
no
matter
how
generally
applicable,
if
it
happens
to
overlap
in
its...
in
its
relief
with
section
510
is...
is
invalid.
justice
scalia
so
what
is
your
answer
to
the
wrongful
death?
i
didn't
get
your
answer.
you
said
it
was
extreme,
but...
but
what
is
your
answer
to
it?
justice
scalia
oh.
what...
you
say
this...
this
should
be
a
federal
cause
of
action.
of
course,
the
employer
denies
that
he...
he
fired
him
for
this
reason,
and
so
the
issue
in
the
federal
case
would...
would
be
whether...
whether
he
did
it
to
interfere
with
the
plan;
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
that
you
didn't
fire
him
for
no
reason
at
all
but
precisely
in
order
to
prevent
his
recovering.
whereas,
if
someone
comes
up
to
me
and
threatens
to
break
my
legs,
it
really
doesn't
matter
what,
you
know,
what
their
reason
is,
does
it?
i
mean,
i
have
a
cause
of
action
for
assault.
or
if
somebody
wrongfully
kills
me,
my...
my...
you
know,
there's
a
wrongful
death
action,
whatever
their
reason
was.
couldn't
you
distinguish
the
situations
on
that
basis
and
say
that
only
the
former
are
preempted
and
not
the
latter?
i
wish
you
would,
because
i
find
it
very...
very
upsetting
that
there's
no
wrongful
death
action.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
well,
more
than
that.
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
the
reason
was
to
deprive
you
of
benefits
under
the
plan.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
reason
was.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
i
don't...
i
don't
understand.
why...
why
is
firing
him
discriminating
but
breaking
his
legs
not?
i...
i
don't
understand--
justice
scalia
--oh,
okay.
justice
scalia
so
you're...
you're
not
even
sure
he'd
have
a...
an
erisa
action?
justice
scalia
no,
only
if
it
is
alleged
and
it...
it
is
an
essential
part
of
the
state
cause
of
action
that
the
reason
for
the
dismissal
was
specifically
to
prevent
the
vesting
of
the
pension.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
that
certainly
narrows
the
category
of
cases
enormously.
justice
scalia
it
may
be
an
element
of
damages,
but
it
is
not,
as
it
is
in
this
suit,
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action.
it
is
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action
here,
to
establish
that
the
reason
the
firing
occurred
was
to
prevent
the
vesting,
and
that
is
quite
different
from
merely
being
an
element
of
the
damages.
justice
scalia
actually,
it
doesn't
say
that.
the
statute
does
not
require
that
it
relate
to
the
terms
or
conditions
of
an
erisa
plan.
the
statute
simply
says,
"relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plan.
"
justice
scalia
petitioner's
explanation,
and
it
strikes
me
as
a
good
one,
is
that
the
definition
of
the
term
state
to
include
political
subdivisions
that
purport
to
regulate
is
an
expansion,
so
that
you
qualify
as
a
state
even
though
you...
ah...
you
are
not
a
state
in
the
narrow
sense,
if
you
purport
to
regulate.
but
if
you
are
a
state,
whether
you're
purporting
to
regulate
the
terms
and
conditions
of
a
plan
or
not,
if
you
are
a
state
properly
speaking,
you're...
you're
bound
by
514(a),
it
seems
to
me--
justice
scalia
--and
the
test
is
whether
it
relates
to
the
plan.
justice
scalia
do
you
have
a
jury
trial
in
the
erisa
action
as
compared
to
the
state
action?
justice
scalia
yes.
would
you.
would
you
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
scalia
would
you
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
under
state
law?
justice
scalia
well,
do
you
think
an
employer
might
be
less
inclined
to
set
up
one
of
these
newfangled
pension
plans
that
the
government
was
trying
to
encourage
if
he
knew
that
he'd
be
subject
to
a...
a
jury
action
in
state
court
for
allegedly
dismissing
people
in
order
to
avoid
the
rights
vesting
under
the
plan?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
but
isn't
that
conceivably
why
the
federal
government
put
in
that
provision?
we're
going
to
assure
you,
up
front,
what
your
liability,
or
the
manner
in
which
it
will
be
determined,
will
be
like.
it
will
not
be
a
jury
trial,
and
it'll
be
in
federal
court.
isn't...
might
that
not
be
an
attraction
to
the
employer
who's
thinking
of
setting
up,
or
not
setting
up,
a
pension
plan?
justice
scalia
well,
perhaps--
[laughter]
