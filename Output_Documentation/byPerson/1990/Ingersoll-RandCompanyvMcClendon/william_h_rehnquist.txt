chief
justice
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
89-1298,
ingersoll-rand
v.
perry
mcclendon.
mr.
hurd,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
an
assault
doesn't
require
any
particular
motive,
either.
i
mean,
the...
the
touching
of
the
person
or
the...
the
attack
on
the
person
regardless
of
the
motive
with
which
it's
done
constitutes
an
assault.
so
do...
do
you
follow
the
distinctions
suggested
by
justice
scalia
that
far?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hurd.
mr.
wright,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
all
the
preemption
provisions
of
erisa
were
not
necessarily
put
in
to
protect
employees
as
opposed
to
employers?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there...
there
you
didn't
have
the
express
and
preemption
provisions
that
you
do
with
erisa,
did
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i...
i
think
you'll
find
the
court's
treatment
of
preemption
has
been
quite
different
in
erisa
cases,
where
you
have
a
broad,
statutory
preemption
provision,
as
opposed
to
simply
occupation
of
the
field
and
implied
preemption,
where
they're
simply
claiming
it's
the
same
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
have
to
do
that?
why,
when
the
statutory
language
doesn't
relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plan,
do
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
plan?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tavormina.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
hurd,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hurd.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1298,
ingersoll-rand
company
versus
mcclendon
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
