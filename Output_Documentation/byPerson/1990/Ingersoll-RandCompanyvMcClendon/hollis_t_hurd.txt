mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
erisa
preemption
case.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
declared
that
the
state
of
texas,
quote,
"has
an
interest
in
protecting
employees'
interests
in
pension
plans.
"
and
held
that
a
terminated
employee
can
recover
under
the
common
law
of
texas
whenever
he
proves
that
the
principal
reason
for
his
termination
was
the
employer's
desire
to
avoid
contributing
to
or
paying
benefits
under
the
employee's
pension
fund.
it
was
a
5
to
4
decision
in
which
the
dissenters
pointed
out
that
this
new
common
law
cause
of
action
under
texas
law
was
preempted
by
erisa.
of
course,
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
statute
preempts
a
state
law
is
a
question
of
the
intent
of
congress.
petitioner
submits
that
the
intent
of
the
93d
congress
in
passing
erisa
is
perfectly
clear
in
every
respect.
in
the
language
of
erisa
where
the
express
preemption
provision
preempts
any
state
law
that
relates
to
an
employee
benefit
plan,
and
this
law
clearly
relates
to
pension
plans;
from
the
structure
of
erisa,
because
congress
inserted
in
erisa
itself
a
provision
which
is
numbered
510
of
erisa
which
does
essentially
the
same
thing
as
the
texas
law
common
law
cause
of
action,
and
which
demonstrates
that
congress
thought
that
protection
against
purposeful
interference
with
rights
under
a
plan
was
not
remote,
peripheral,
or
tangential
but
was
central
to
the
business
of
regulating
employee
benefit
plans.
next,
from
the
enforcement
provisions
of
erisa
which
this
court
has
held
are
comprehensive,
interrelated
and
exclusive,
and
those
are
the
means
for
enforcing
section
510
of
erisa.
next,
from
the
legislative
history
of
erisa,
which
demonstrates
clearly
as
this
court
has
previously
held
in
the
shaw
case
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
at
a
minimum
all
state
laws
treating
the
same
subjects
as
erisa,
and
the
texas
law
clearly
treats
the
same
subject
as
erisa
section
510
does;
and
finally,
from
the
purposes
of
erisa
preemption.
the
purpose
of
every
provision
of
erisa
is
to
promote
and
protect
employees'
interests
in
pension
plans.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
in
that
case,
your
honor,
if
the
employer's
motivation
is
alleged
to
be
a
purpose
to
interfere
with
the
attainment
of
benefits
under
a
plan--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--then
that
would
stay
a
claim
under
section
510
of
erisa,
and
that
state
law,
whatever
state
law
was
used,
contract
or
misrepresentation
and
so
forth,
that
state
law
would
be
preempted
as
applied
to
that
cause
of
action.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
absolutely.
that's
my
next
point.
under
section
510
of
erisa,
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
uniformly
that
the
relief
available
is
employment-related
relief.
that
is
to
say,
the
courts
can
order
the
individual
reinstated
to
employment.
the
courts
can
also
order
back
pay
and
front
pay
and
also
damages
equal
to
the
value
of
the
lost
benefits.
in
other
words,
the
wrong
is...
is
an
employment
action,
and
the
remedy
is
to
reverse
that
employment
action.
it's
not
to
award
benefits.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
through
the
employer's
purpose
to
interfere
with
rights
under
the
plan.
our
point
is
that
congress
set
up
the
rights
and
remedies
for
those
who
believe
that
the
employer
purposefully
interfered
with
our
attainment
of
benefits
under
a
plan,
and
congress'
scheme
is
exclusive.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
your
honor,
the
lower
courts
so
far
have
held
that
punitive
damages
are
not
available
in
actions--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--under
erisa,
your
honor,
attorneys'
fees
may
be
granted
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
a
prevailing
plaintiff.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
i
would
say,
your
honor,
it
preempts
the
cause
of
action
based
on
the
employer's
alleged
motivation
to
deprive
the
individual
of
benefits.
now
if
the
employee--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--that's
correct.
the...
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
purposeful
interference
with
right
to
benefits
under
a
plan,
and
that
cause
of
action
is
preempted,
including
other
nonpreempted
cause
of
actions
in
the
complaint,
doesn't
diminish
the
federal
character
of
that
one.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
if
the...
if
the
cause
of
action
alleged
by
the
individual
does
not
reveal
that
he's
relying
on
an
alleged
motivation
to
deprive
the
individual
of
benefits,
then
that
does
not
have
any
connection
with
a
reference
to
a
plan.
as
soon
as
the
element
of
connection
to
the
plan
is
introduced,
then
his
claim
has
a
connection
with
a
reference
to
the
plan.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
the
case
becomes
federal
in
character.
congress
provided
that
causes
of
action
under
section
510
are
to
be
heard
exclusively
in
the
federal
courts.
so
when
it
becomes
clear
that
the
complaint
states
a
federal
cause
of
action,
the
case
could
be
removed
to
federal
court.
also--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--in
your
question,
your
honor,
i
haven't
heard
any
connection
with
a
reference
to
a
plan.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
if
that--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--state
law,
state
criminal
laws
of
general
application
are
expressly--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--not
a
civil
action.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
there
is
a
section
510
case--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--no,
your
honor.
the
examples
can
get
pretty
extreme,
but
the
principle
is--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--well,
our
point,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
decided
what
remedies
should
be
available
to
someone
who
believed
that
the
employer
discharged,
fined,
expelled,
et
cetera,
or
otherwise
discriminated
against
them.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
my
answer
is
that
would
be
preempted.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
that's
a
question
of
federal
courts,
your
honor,
after
the
individual
has
lost
on
the
merits
of
his
federal
claim
what
happens
to
the
state--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--that's
correct.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
because
the
discharge
was
wrongful
for
other
reasons
such
as
a
breach
of
the
common
law
contract.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
that's
correct.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
the
federal
court
would
have
pendent
jurisdiction
over
those
purely
state
law
claims
while
considering
the
federal
cause
of
action
under
section
510.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
may...
may
i
just
add
one
point
to
the
question
justice
scalia
was
asking?
although
it
sounds
farfetched,
there
is
in
fact
a
case
under
erisa
section
510
where
an
individual
was
a
participant
in
a
multiemployer
pension
plan
and
alleged
that
the
trustees
of
the
plan
threatened
him
that
they
would
break
his
legs
unless
he
ceased
from
insisting
on
receiving
information
regarding
the
administration
of
the
plan.
that
was
held
to
state
a
cause
of
action
under
section
510
of
erisa,
and
he
prevailed.
i'm
sure
it
did,
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
it
also
states
a
valid
cause
of
action
under
state
law,
and
the
case
did
not
hold
that
you
couldn't.
isn't
there
a
difference
as
to
whether,
in
order
to
recover
under
state
law
you
must
prove
that
the
purpose
was
to
deprive
you
of
benefits
under
the
plan?
in
this
case,
that
that
was
essential
to
recovering
under
the
state
law,
wasn't
it?
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
absolutely.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
i
suppose
so,
your
honor.
the
section
510
erisa
relates
to
employment-type
actions,
and
i
think
that
in
your
case
assault
or
murder
can
reasonably
regarded
as...
be
regarded
as
not
an
employment-type
action.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i'm
just
now
catching
the
drift
of
your
question.
that's
completely
correct.
the
cause
of
action
in
order
for
the
individual
to
prevail
doesn't
require
any
connection
to
a
plan.
in
that
sense,
it's
not
necessarily
connected,
whereas
in
this
case
the
cause
of
action
exists
only
because
the
employer's
conduct
is
connected
to
a
plan.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
yes,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
that
distinction.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
if
he
can
recover
for
assault
merely
because
he
was
in
fact
assaulted
without
regard
to
the
reason,
then
i'd
say
that
his
cause
of
action
for
assault
has
no
necessary
connection
to
or
reference
to
a
plan,
and--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--that's
correct,
because
it's
not
necessary
to
his
recovery,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
no,
your
honor.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
no,
your
honor.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
your
honor,
that
the
case
was
treated
as
a
run-of-the-mill
wrongful
discharge
case
from
the
very
beginning.
after
ingersoll-rand
demonstrated
to
mr.
mcclendon
that
he
was
in
fact
vested
in
his
pension
and
had
been
vested
before
he
was
terminated,
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
not
pushed
by
mr.
mcclendon,
and
so
ingersoll-rand
didn't
work
on
a
defense.
it
was
really
the
supreme
court
of
texas
that
resurrected
that
issue
and
addressed
and
decided
the
federal
question
that's
presented
here
for
this
court's
decision.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that,
throughout
erisa,
congress
was
making
a
delicate
balance.
when
you
talk
about
promoting
and
preserving
employees'
interests
in
plans,
there
are
two
elements.
one
is
promoting
the
employees'
rights,
but
the
other
part
of
it
is
promoting
the
maintenance
and
establishment
of
plans
themselves.
section
510
enforced,
through
the
remedies
of
section
502,
are
the
enforcement
mechanism
and
the
remedies
that
congress
decided
were
appropriate
and
struck
the
right
balance
between
the
employee's
interest
in
recovering
damages
and
their
desire
not
to
discourage
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
plans.
to...
to
take
justice
scalia's
question,
it's...
you
can
imagine
a
grocery
store
with
20
employees
in
texas.
suppose
there's
high
turnover
within
the
first
2
years,
but
very
little
turnover
of
employees
after
that.
it
would
make
sense
for
the
employer
in
that
case
to
establish
a
pension
plan
with
2-year
cliff
vesting,
so
that
no
one
was
vested
before
2
years,
everyone
was
fully
vested
after
2
years.
but
the
first
time
a
jury
verdict
comes
down
from
the
state
court
in
texas
with
punitive
damages
in
it,
the
employer's
going
to
think
very
seriously
about
whether
he
should
alter
the
vesting
schedule
and
make
it
the
maximum
permitted
by
law...
5-year
cliff
vesting,
so
as
to
diminish
the
credibility
of
the
claims
of
people
who
might
sue
who
were
let
go
in
the
first
2
years.
this,
of
course,
would
work
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
other
participants
in
the
plan.
another
thing
the
employer
might
do
in
that
situation
is
install
full
and
immediate
vesting,
so
that
everyone
is
vested
on
the
day
they
walk
in,
so
that
once
again,
there's
no
risk
of
an
employee
who
is
terminated
claiming
the
termination
was
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
his
vesting.
but
once
again,
that
would
result
in
giving
pensions
to
people
who
only
worked
there
for
a
month,
and
would
diminish,
overall,
the
pool
of
pension
money
available
to
those
who
really
do
stay
with
the
employer
until
retirement.
congress
decided
that
the
balance
that
they
struck
in
sections
510
and
502
of
erisa
was
the
appropriate
balance,
so
that
employees
had
protections
without
going
so
far
as
to
discourage
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
plans.
in
this
way,
section
510
clearly
does
relate
to
plans.
congress
understood
that
there's
really
a
triangular
relationship
at
work.
you
have
the
plan,
the
employer,
and
the
employee,
and
all
three
sides
of
that
triangle
relate
to
the
plan.
the
employee
versus
the
plan
is
vesting
claim
procedures,
and
so
forth,
the
employer
vis-a-vis
the
plan
is
the
funding
requirements,
for
example,
but
equally
important
is
the
employer
versus
the
employee,
whenever
the
employer
acts
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
the
rights
under
the
plan.
in
that
case,
that
aspect
of
the
employment
relationship
is
where
it
overlaps
with
the
field
of
employee
benefit
plans.
when
the
congress
occupied
the
field
of
employee
benefit
plans,
it
did
occupy
that
portion
of
the
employment
relationship
precisely
because
it
does
relate
to
employee
benefit
plans.
back
on
the
subject
of
force
or
the
threat
of
force,
let
me
just
note
that
the
following
section
of
erisa,
section
511,
makes
it
unlawful
to
employ
force,
fraud,
or
the
threat
of
force
in
order
to
interfere
with
someone's
right
to
benefits
under
a
plan.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
no,
your
honor.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
claims
of
violation
of
section
510
are
enforced
under
section
502(a)(3),
of
which
the
federal
courts
have
exclusive--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--i
think
that
portion
of
the
conference
report
is
referring
to
claims
for
benefits
under
502(a)(1)(b).
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
claims
for
benefits--
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
--can
be
brought
in
either
state
or
federal
court,
although
the
law
applied
is
federal
law.
mr.
hollis
t.
hurd
but
under
502(a)(3),
which
is
used
to
enforce
section
510,
only
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
of
those
actions.
