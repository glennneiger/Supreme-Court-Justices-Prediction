justice
o'connor
well,
is
the
matter
of
remedy
one
that
we
respond
to
in
equity?
do
we
apply
equitable
principles
to
determine
what
to
do?
justice
o'connor
and
if
that
were
done
then
all
criminal
convictions
that
had
been
obtained
in
the
meantime
in
any
of
these
courts
would
be
set
aside
likewise?
justice
o'connor
and
if
there
are
some
that
have
been
filled
in
this
interim
time,
but
weren't
precleared,
what
about
the
actions
taken
by
those
people
in
the
meantime?
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
mean
by
limited
voting?
justice
o'connor
well,
by
limited
voting
you
don't
mean
subdistricting?
