justice
souter
on
some
cases
should
we
be
asking
a
different
question?
instead
of
asking
the
question
whether
the
later
clearance
automatically
preclears
everything
that
preceded
it,
should
we
at
least
in
cases
where
the
issue
is
the
number
of
office
holders
to
be
chosen,
simple
numerical
issue,
should
we
instead
ask
whether
the
later
preclearance
moots
the
fact
or
the
issue
that
might
be
raised
about
the
prior
clearance?
you
said,
i
think,
in
your
brief
that
there
might,
for
example,
always
be,
or
there
is
always
a
potential
issue
of
intent.
well,
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
was
an
improper
intent
the
last
time
the
number
was
expanded.
when
we
get
to
the...
which
were
not
precleared,
and
we
get
to
the
final
expansion,
the
number
is
increased
again
but
there
is
no
improper
intent.
the
fact
is
at
that
point
the
intent
is
to
have
whatever
the
later
number
was,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
had
been
done
in
two
steps
or
three
steps.
the
result
is
going
to
be
the
same,
and
if
there
is
no
improper
intent
to
that,
doesn't
that
moot
the
issue
of
the
prior
failures?
justice
souter
no,
i
realize
that.
but
if
you
had
gone
from
let's
say
the
original
number
to
the
final
number
without
any
intermediate
steps,
and
you
get
to
the
point
at
which
the
final
request
for
whatever
the
last
number
is
has
no
improper
intent
to
it,
why
doesn't
that
moot
out
the
intent
with
respect
to
the
intermediate
step?
it
doesn't
imply
that
he
is
automatically
preclearing
it.
it's
just
saying
it
is
no
longer
of
relevance
to
us
because
maybe
there
was
an
intent,
an
improper
intent,
to
increase
the
number
to
five,
but
we're
now
concerned
with
the
intent
to
have
a
number
of
seven,
let's
say.
and
there
is
no
improper
intent
with
respect
to
seven.
justice
souter
well,
what
does
he
do
as
a
practical
matter?
let's
assume
he
says
i
agree
with
you,
i
think
seven
is
the
appropriate
number.
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
no
unconstitutional
or
unstatutory
intent
here.
and
yet
because
you
failed
to
preclear
the
intermediate
step
when
you
went
from
three
to
five...
what's
he
going
to
do,
say
i
will
only
increase
the
number
to
five
now?
justice
souter
but
he
would
at
the
same
time
be
saying
i
agree
with
you,
seven
is
the
appropriate
number,
but
because
you
failed
in
the
past
we
will
freeze
it
at
three?
what
does
he
do?
justice
souter
well,
but
just
tell
me
what
he's
supposed
to
do
at
that
point?
justice
souter
well,
he
objects,
and
what
should
the
result
be
then?
that
the
process
is
forever
frozen
at
three?
that's
not
what
you're
arguing
for.
justice
souter
well
why
doesn't
it
comply
with
the
voting
right
act
if
they
want
to
expand
it
to
seven
and
there
is
no
discriminatory
intent?
justice
souter
what
is
it...
i
beg
your
pardon.
what
is
it
exactly
that
you
ask
for
when
you
ask
for
clearance?
do
you
say
in
effect
here
is
the
amended
statute,
please
preclear
the
scheme
which
that
statute
will
provide
if
approved
by
you?
or,
conversely,
do
you
say
we
want
to
add
one
more
judgeship?
justice
souter
just
mentioning
the
number
that
you
want
to
add?
