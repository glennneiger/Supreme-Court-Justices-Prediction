justice
scalia
of
course
he
hadn't
disapproved
any
before
then,
anyway?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
he
had
always
approved
them?
justice
scalia
but
mccain
did
not
involve
the
kind
of
change
that
you
and
justice
souter
have
been
talking
about,
just
adding
another
number
where
a
prior
number
would
be
included
within
the
later
number.
they
were
changes
of
quite
different
types,
weren't
they?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
right.
so
you
couldn't
say
seven
includes
four.
they
were
quite
different
items.
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
it's
quite
reasonable
to
say
that
a
change
in
number
does
not
approve
a
prior
change
in
form.
but
it
is
reasonable
to
say
that
if
you
say
seven
is
okay,
presumably
four
is
okay.
justice
scalia
but
what
difference
does
it
make
if
the
change
to
four
was
bad,
so
long
as
you
know
that
the
increase
to
seven
is
okay?
whether
it's
an
increase
from
four
or
from
five?
justice
scalia
that
still
leaves
you
with
the
question
of
what
you're
going
to
do
when
the
state
comes
back
and
says
okay,
you
say
number
four
was
no
good,
i
still
want
seven.
so
instead
of
increasing
me
from
five
to
seven,
increase
me
from
four
to
seven.
what
happens?
justice
scalia
so
once
it
has
made
the
mistake
in
going
from
three
to
four
and
not
getting
preclearance,
it
can
never,
it
can
never
correct
that?
justice
scalia
mr.
feldman,
why
does
the
attorney
general
take
the
position
that
it's
only
the
earlier
approval
that
is
invalid?
i
suppose
the
later
approvals
are
nugatory
too,
aren't
they,
if
the
earlier
one
was...
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
the
one
that
was
not
precleared
was
going
from
three
to
four.
what
did
they
submit
for
after
that?
they
submit
clearance
to
go
from
four
to
five,
and
the
attorney
general
said
you
can
go
from
four
to
five
and
you
can
go
from
five
to
six.
justice
scalia
but
since
there
was
never
a
four,
or
a
valid
four,
it
seems
to
me
those
later
approvals
are
invalid
too.
he
never
did
approve
going
from
four
to
five,
because
he
had
never
approved
four.
doesn't
the
whole,
whole
house
come
down?
you
just
pull
out
one
story
like
that
and
the
rest
hangs
up
there?
justice
scalia
of
course
if
that
was
wrong,
your
remedy
was
in
the
district
of
columbia,
not
by
ignoring
the
disapproval.
justice
scalia
where
did
that
come
from?
justice
scalia
what
did
the...
what
did
the
district
court
in
this
case...
how
did
it
decide
that
these
positions
at
issue
had
actually
been
precleared?
justice
scalia
mr.
pugh,
when
we,
when
an
agency
does
something
for
a
wrong
reason
we
normally...
let's
say
denies
an
approval
for
an
incorrect
reason...
we
normally
don't
give
the
approval
here,
but
we
send
it
back
to
the
agency.
i
mean,
maybe
they
have
done
it
for
the
wrong
reason,
but
there
may
be
a
right
reason
which
they
haven't
considered
because
they
have
used
the
wrong
one.
so
simply
because
the
justice
department
used
the
wrong
reason
in
disapproving,
i'm
not
sure
that
gives
you
the
remedy
of
simply
deeming
that
they
approved
it.
they
disapproved
it
for
the
wrong
reason,
but
don't
they
still
have
a
shot
at
disapproving
it?
justice
scalia
well,
it
may
well
be
that
the
initial
election
can
proceed,
but
your
claim
is
that
having
used
the
wrong
reason,
the
justice
department
is
disempowered
forever
from
passing
upon
the
validity
of
the
change.
justice
scalia
mr.
pugh,
i
hate
to
take
you
back
a
little
bit,
but
i'm
not
clear
what
kind
of
mistakes
by
the
justice
department
you
would
acknowledge
do
not
allow
you
to
challenge
their
refusal
to
preclear
in...
back
in
the
three-judge
court.
what
kind
of
mistakes
can
they
make?
justice
scalia
yes,
what
kind
of
mistake
can
they
make
which
you
would
acknowledge
can
only
be
challenged
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
not
in
the
proceeding
back
home?
justice
scalia
only
factual...
only
factual
errors
by
the
justice
department?
justice
scalia
well,
i
understand
that,
but
every
time
an
agency
makes
a
mistake
of
law
it's
acting
ultra
vires.
i
mean,
that's
the
definition
of
making
a
mistake
of
law.
so
your
position
is
that
any
mistake
of
law
the
justice
department
makes
in
the
preclearance
context
can
be
reviewed
back
in
the
locality
and
doesn't
have
to
be
challenged
in
the
district
of
columbia
proceeding?
