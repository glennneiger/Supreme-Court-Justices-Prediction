mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
address
for
a
moment
justice
white's
question.
in
the
action
going
on,
the
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
district
of
columbia,
not
all
of
the
judgeships
that
are
currently
before
this
court
are
at
issue.
since
the
district
court...
since
the
district
court
in
this
case
held
that
some
of
them
had
already
been
precleared,
the
state
did
not
ask
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
those
should,
that
those
had
no
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect
in
the
washington
action,
and
therefore
those
seats
would...
something
has
to
be
done
with
those
seats
regardless
of
what
happens
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
can't
tell
you
the
exact
number.
the
number
18
is
what
is
in
my
mind,
but
i
am
not
sure
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
they
should
have
been
precleared,
it's
our
submission
that
because
they
should
have
been
precleared
and
weren't,
it
will
be
up
to
the...
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
district
court
to
make
a
remedial
determination
of
what
the
best
course
of
action
in
this
case
is.
it
may
depend
on
a
number
of
different
factors.
now
some,
when
i
said...
whatever
the
number
is,
it
involves
i
think
some
vacancies,
for
instance.
well,
insofar
as
it
involves
vacancies,
i
think
we
would
suggest
that
if
the
seats
have
never
been
filled,
for
instance
if
they
are
newly
created
seats,
the
district
court
may
reasonably
say
the
state
doesn't
really
need
those
seats.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
state
could
do
that,
but
they
haven't
because
the
district
court's
judgment
in
this
case
was
that
those
seats
had
already
been
precleared.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
it's...
again,
it's
our
submission
that
it's
going
to
be
up
to
the
district
court
to
make...
it
should
be
up
to
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there...
i
think
that
it
might
not
be
possible
to
make
a
categorical
judgment.
that,
i
think
that
might
be
the
best
i
can
do
right
now.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
we'll
have
to...
it's
certainly
the
case
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i
think
it
will
certainly
be
the
case
that
the
state
of
louisiana
will
be
able
to
make
the
showing,
actually
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
we
thought
they
would
be
able
to,
that
they
need
some
of
these
judgeships
in
operation
in
order
for
their
courts
to
operate.
and
it
will
certainly
be...
it
will
probably
be
the
case
that
the
state
will
be
able
to
show
that.
and
in
the
remedial
phase
of
the
proceeding
the
district
court
reasonably
can
take
that
into
account
and
can
perhaps
even
permit
the
judges
to
stay
in
office
until
the
declaratory
judgment
action
has
been
completed.
again,
there
may
be
other
cases
where
it's
a
newly
created
judgeship
where
the
state
can't
make
a
showing
that
it
needs
that
position
filled,
and
in
those
cases
i
think
the
district
court
would
be
best
off
to
enjoin
the
state
from
filling
those
positions.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
i
would
say
with
respect
to
seats,
for
instance,
that
have
never
been
filled,
the
district
court
would
reasonably
say
the
state
cannot
hold
an
election
to
fill
those
seats
unless
and
until
it's
precleared.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
it's
our
view
that
whatever...
first
of
all,
whatever
actions
have
been
taken
by
the
judges
in
these
seats
are
valid.
that
follows
from
the
de
facto
officers
doctrine
that
this
case
has
recognized
in
reapportionment
cases,
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
for
instance,
where--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
want
to
speculate
about
what
state
law
is,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
as
far
as
louisiana
law
goes
these
judges
are
validly
in
office,
and
their
acts
should
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
and
it's
not
even
inconsistent
at
the
remedy
stage
to
permit
the...
for
the
district
court
to
make
the
remedial
determination
in
its
discretion
that
the
judges
should
stay
in
office
and
continue
to
make
valid
decisions.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
before
they
are
elected
a
district
court
should
not,
under
the
voting
rights
act,
permit
an
election
to
go
forward.
after
all,
the
voting
rights
act
is
keyed
to
voting
and
to
elections,
and
the
text
of
the
statute
specifically
talks
about
preclearance,
that
voting
laws
shall
not
be
implemented
unless
and
until
they
are
precleared.
and
in
those
circumstances
where
the
election
has
not
yet
been
held
and
where
the
plaintiff
makes
a
timely
motion
for
an
injunction,
and
if
the
seats
have
not
been
precleared,
as
the
district
court
admitted
had
been
the
case
with
some
of
the
seats
here,
then
the
district
court
should
grant
an
injunction
at
that
stage.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
if
you're
assuming...
assuming
with
the
question
that
the
plaintiff
has
made
a
timely
motion,
for
instance
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
the
only
one
i
can
think
of
is
where...
and
one
of
the
cases,
i
don't
remember
which
one,
that
this
court
decided,
the
plaintiffs
came
in
i
think
2
days
or
3
days
before
the
election.
a
district
court,
i
don't
think
under
those
circumstances,
can
be
expected
to
be
familiar
with
the
situation
and
to
enjoin
an
election
there.
in
fact
it
reasonably
couldn't
even
in
that
period
of
time
come
to
a
determination
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
once
the
district
court
has
come
to
the
determination
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act,
then
i
think...
of
section
5,
that
the
seats
haven't
been
precleared...
then
i
think
that
an
injunction
is
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
so.
i
think
they
all...
i
would
say
yes.
the
kinds
of
reasons
they
gave,
that
was
the
convenience
of
a
particular
date
as
the
best
time
to
have
an
election
because
it's
likely
to
have
most
participation,
well,
for
example,
as
to
that
factor
these
elections
shouldn't
have
been
held
at
all
if
the
seats
weren't
precleared.
and
the
question
of
what
date
is
the
right
date
to
hold
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
be
important.
another
factor
in
this
case
the
district
court
considered
was
the
reliance
interest
of
the
candidates.
but
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
these
elections,
they
had
been
enjoined
almost,
they
had
been
enjoined
for
a
long,
for
quite
a
while
under
the
section
2
case.
and
it's
very
hard
to
see
how
there
would
have
been
little...
there
would
have
been
much
of
any
reliance
interest.
moreover,
in
the
original
order
that
the
district
court
handed
down
concerning
these
elections,
it
said
that
the
people
would
only
be...
that
the
winning
judges
would
only
take
office
provisionally.
and
in
fact
it
didn't
even
say
they
would
be
instated
in
office.
it
just
permitted
the
elections.
and
so
in
those
circumstances,
too,
i
think
the
reliance
interest
of
the
candidates
would
be
weak.
and
finally,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
hampton
county,
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act,
in
fact
the
uncertainty
about
the
elections
could
well
cut
directly
the
other
way,
which
is
it
could
keep
people
from
qualifying,
from
entering
qualifications
for
running
for
office,
and
doing
other
things
that...
and
it
might
therefore
be
most
preferable
to
hold
the
elections...
it
would
be
preferable
not
to
hold
the
election
until
the
seats
have
been
precleared
and
it
is
clear
that
a
legal...
a
legally
valid
election
is
going
to
go
forward.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
so.
i
think
it
defies
gravity
in
that
sense.
when
the
attorney
general
approves
the
addition
of
another
seat,
he
is
approving
that,
only
that
change
in
voting
procedure,
and
that
change
is
the
addition
of
one
seat
to
the
district.
once
he
has
approved
the
addition
of
that
seat,
the
state
may
hold
the
election
and
may
give
it
effect.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
he
does
know
how
many
there
are.
but
if
you
look
at
the
regulations,
for
instance,
they
specifically
provide
that
a
state
when
it
makes
its
submissions
must
identify
that
all
of
its
prior
judgeships
have
been
precleared
and
that...
and
therefore
he
can
reasonably
assume
that
the
prior
ones
already
have
been
precleared
when
he
makes
a
decision
just
that
the
addition
of
that
one
would
not
violate
the
voting
rights
act.
