mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
the
enforcement
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
section
5
is
the
preclearance
section
of
the
act
and
was
designed
to
apply
to
specific
jurisdictions,
including
the
state
of
louisiana.
it
routinely
and
through
a
variety
of
nefarious
means
denied
many
of
their
own
citizens
the
right
to
vote
solely
on
account
of
skin
color.
in
order
to
prevent
this
discrimination
in
the
future,
congress
exercised
its
authority
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
provided
in
section
5
that
a
covered
jurisdiction
may
not
implement
a
voting
change
unless
and
until
it
demonstrates
to
a
federal
authority,
the
attorney
general
or
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
that
the
change
is
not
discriminatory.
by
doing
so,
congress
shifted
what
this
court
often
has
called
the
advantages
of
time
and
inertia
from
the
perpetrators
of
the
evil
to
its
victims.
this
is
a
case
about
voting
changes
for
elections
for
state
court
judges.
section
5
covers
voting
changes
for
elections
for
state
court
judges,
just
as
it
covers
voting
changes
for
elections
of
other
public
officials.
this
court
twice
has
summarily
affirmed
lower
court
decisions
to
that
effect,
the
most
recent
being
this
past
fall
in
the
case
from
georgia,
and
the
appellees
make
no
contention
that
judicial
elections
are
excluded
from
section
5's
coverage.
this
appeal
raises
three
issues.
first,
can
voting
changes
involving
the
creation
of
judgeships
that
have
not
been
submitted
for
evaluation
under
section
5
nevertheless
be
retroactively
cleared
solely
because
of
the
submission
and
preclearance
of
later
voting
changes
involving
subsequent
judgeships
in
the
same
election
district?
second,
did
the
three-judge
district
court
err
in
permitting
elections
for
state
court
judges
pursuant
to
uncleared
voting
changes
to
which
the
attorney
general
objected
under
section
5
because
of
his
concern
about
the
possibility
of
racial
discrimination?
third,
in
the
event
the
district
court
did
err
in
permitting
the
elections
to
go
forward,
what
relief
should
be
ordered
by
this
court
at
the
present
juncture?
these
issues
arrive,
arise
in
the
following
factual
context.
in
louisiana
during
the
past
25
years
the
legislature
enacted
a
number
of
voting
changes
with
respect
to
judicial
elections,
most
of
them
involving
the
creation
of
judgeships
to
be
elected
at
large
in
majority
white,
multi-member
districts.
in
violation
of
section
5
state
officials
implemented
many
of
those
voting
changes
and
held
elections
for
many
of
the
judges
without
seeking
preclearance.
at
the
same
time
state
officials
did
submit
and
obtained
preclearance
for
some
of
the
judgeships.
as
a
result
in
some
judicial
districts
there
were
combinations
of
cleared
and
uncleared
judgeships
within
the
same
district.
only
in
response
to
this
litigation
in
1987
did
state
officials
go
back
and
submit
all
of
the
prior
uncleared
voting
changes
involving
the
creation
of
judgeships
to
the
attorney
general
for
preclearance.
beginning
on
september
23,
1988,
the
attorney
general
interposed
objections
to
some
of
the
voting
changes
involving
the
creation
of
judgeships
in
certain
specific
judicial
election
districts
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
state
officials
did
not
then
take
any
action
to
seek
preclearance
in
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
correct.
after
the
attorney
general's
initial
objection
the
state
took
no
action
to
seek
preclearance
in
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
instead
the
state
proceeded
with
the
1990
elections,
even
for
the
judgeships
to
which
the
attorney
general
objected.
the
plaintiffs
filed
a
motion
for
an
injunction
to
stop
the
elections
and
the
district
court
denied
the
injunction
for
the
most
part.
the
district...
with
respect
to
some
of
the
judgeships
the
district
court
held
that
the
preclearance
of
later
voting
changes
involving
subsequent
judgeships
in
the
particular
judicial
districts
retroactively
cleared
all
the
prior
previously
unsubmitted
judgeships.
with
respect
to
other
judgeships
that
the
district
court
conceded
were
uncleared,
the
district
court
nevertheless
permitted
the
elections
to
go
forward
and
permitted
the
winners
to
hold
office
for
as
long
as
it
takes
the
state
to
initiate
and
litigate
in
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
a
section
5
preclearance
action.
on
november
2,
1990,
this
court
issued
an
injunction
pending
appeal
against
some
of
the
elections
the
district
court
had
permitted
to
go
forward.
finally
on
january
19,
1991,
of
this
year,
2-1/2
years
after
the
attorney
general
initially
interposed
his
objections,
the
state
of
louisiana
filed
a
section
5
declaratory
judgment
action
in
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
first
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
issue
of
retroactive
clearance.
section
5
places
upon
the
covered
jurisdictions
the
burden
of
notifying
the
federal,
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
attorney
general
of
voting
changes.
in
order
to
prevent
circumvention
of
the
act,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
cases
like
mccain
v.
lybrand
and
united
states
v.
board
of
commissioners
of
sheffield,
alabama,
that
section
5
submissions
must
identify
exactly
the
changes
that
are
being
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
for
review,
and
the
attorney
general
can
never
be
deemed
to
have
precleared
those
changes
that
are
not
submitted
for
review.
this
preserves
the
integrity
of
the
section
5
process
by
preventing
disguised
preclearance
and
by
ensuring
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
unwittingly
preclear
something
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
examine.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
not
at
all,
because
the
attorney
general
had
no
opportunity
to
examine
the
discriminatory
intent
that
was
involved
in
the
creation
of...
or
the
expansion
of
the
at
large
system
to
whatever
number
you
had
prior
to
the
most
recent
change.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
because
the
expansion
of
the
at
large
system
to
that
level
had
been
motivated
by
discriminatory
intent,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
attorney
general
is
empowered
to
stop
under
section
5.
i
mean,
certainly...
look
at
it
this
way.
suppose
instead
of
the
attorney
general
being
submitted
the
change
from
five
to
seven
he
was
submitted
the
change
from
five
to
seven
and
then
also
was
told,
by
the
way,
we
never
precleared
the
change
from
two
to
five.
we
also
want
to
submit
that
to
you.
therefore
the
attorney
general
has
all
of
the
evidence
in
front
of
him,
and
he
looks
at
the
prior
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent
and
says
it
is
clear
to
me
this
was
improper
and
i
am
going
to
interpose
an
objection.
that
is
perfectly--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--no,
i
would
think
the
attorney
general
would
then...
i
mean,
obviously
he
could
do
what
he
wanted
to,
but
i
think
he
would
object
to
both
changes.
i
mean,
because
the
system
had
been
expanded--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--no,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
what's
the
appropriate
number.
it's
a
matter
of
whether
the
at-large
election
method
was
incorporated
and
expanded
for
discriminatory
reasons.
and
if
it
was
expanded
from
two
to
five
for
discriminatory
reasons,
that
expansion
is
invalid,
and
the
attorney
general
is
not
only
entitled
to
but
has
the
duty
to
object
to
that.
now
the
fact
that
without
such
evidence
the
number
of
seven
might
be
appropriate
makes
no
difference
in
the
situation
that
is
discussed
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
he's
supposed
to
object.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
oh,
no.
the
state
can
then
expand
its
judicial
work
force,
it
can
expand
the
number
of
judges
in
that
district
through
some
election
method
that
complies
with
the
voting
rights
act
and
through
which
it
can
obtain
preclearance.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
because
there
was
a
discrimination
in
the
intermediate
expansion
to
the
level
of
five.
i
mean,
you
can't
divorce
the
change
from
five
to
seven
from
the
change
to
two
to
five.
here
state
officials
never
submitted
these
prior
changes
until
the
instigation
of
this
litigation
in
1987.
only
when
the
appellants
sought
to
enjoin
the
fall
1990
elections
did
the
state
defendants
claim
for
the
first
time
that
the
prior
changes
already
had
been
retroactively
cleared.
and
the
district
court
accepted
their
arguments
and
invalidated
the
attorney
general's
objection
on
the
premise
that
the
preclearance
of
an
amendment
to
a
state
statute
necessarily
preclears
the
entire
statute
and
all
prior
amendments
to
the
statute.
now
that
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
opinion
7
years
ago
in
mccain
v.
lybrand.
there
the
court
said
in
unmistakable
terms
that
the
submission
of
a
voting
change
such
as
an
increase
in
the
number
of
seats
in
a
particular
election
district
covers
only
the
precise
change
identified
in
the
submission.
it
cannot
be
considered
a
retroactive
submission
of
prior
voting
changes
or
prior
amendments
to
a
state
statute
in
that
election
district.
mccain
also
said
that
deference
should
be
given
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
that
the
prior
change
was
never
submitted,
never
evaluated,
and
never
precleared.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
actually
the
subsequent
change
was
a
change
in
the
number
of
seats--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--plus
a
couple
of
other
minor
changes.
the
prior
change
was
the
change
in
the
form
of
government.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
right,
but
mccain
did
not
rest
either
on
the
dissimilarity
of
the
two
changes
or
any
sort
of...
the
dramatic
nature
of
the
prior
change.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
but,
your
honor,
it's
not
just
the
number
that's
at
issue
here.
it's
the
level
of
discrimination,
whether
intent
or
effect,
involving...
involved
in
the
expansion
of
the
at
large
system.
and
as
the
hypothetical
justice
souter
and
i
were
discussing
demonstrates,
it's
important
for
the
attorney
general,
and
section
5
requires,
i
think,
for
the
attorney
general
to
be
entitled
to
examine
the
evidence
behind
each
independent
voting
change
and
each
independent
expansion
of
the
particular
election
method
in
that
district.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
because
you
have
an
election
system
in
that
district,
and
a
judicial
structure
in
that
district,
whose
expansion
was
motivated
by
discriminatory
intent.
and
i
think
this
is
the
key
point.
the
attorney
general,
under
the
district
court's
holding,
has
no
opportunity
to
examine
the
discriminatory
intent
involved
in
the
intermediate
changes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
exactly.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
exactly.
and
that's
the
attorney
general's
concern.
and
i
think--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--well,
the
attorney
general
objects
to
the
voting
changes
because
he
has
found
discrimination,
and
then
the
state
has
to
go
back
and
if
it
wants
to
expand
the
number
of
judgeships
in
that
particular
election
district
it
has
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
satisfies
the
attorney
general
or
the
federal
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
that
section
5
is
complied
with.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
well,
it
can
go
back
and
submit
the
change
from
three
to
four
to
the
attorney
general
or
to
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
obtain
preclearance,
if
preclearance
is
deemed
appropriate.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
certainly.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes,
you
do,
your
honor,
because
the
district
court
held
that
all
of
these
prior
judgeships
did
not
even
need
to
be
precleared,
they
had
already
been
precleared,
and
therefore
the
district
court
has
said
those
judges
can
remain
in
office.
the
elections
were
held,
the
judges
can
remain
in
office
throughout
their
full
terms.
with
respect
to
other
judges
that
the
district
court
said,
or
judgeships
the
district
court
said
were
uncleared,
the
district
court
put
them
on
the
schedule
by
which
they
will
only
stay
in
office
pending
the
litigation
of
the
d.c.
case,
and
will
have
to
go
out
of
office
if
the
state
loses
the
d.c.
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
if
the
state
wins
in
d.c.--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--all
of
these
changes
will
be
precleared.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
now,
but
if
the
state
loses
in
d.c.--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--well,
we--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--we
have
asked
that
the
elections
be
set
aside--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--because
the
elections
were
illegal
in
the
first
place--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--if
the
state
were
to
win
tomorrow,
perhaps
the
courts
could
hold
that
it's
okay
to
leave
the
status
quo
in
place.
but
it's...
most
of
these
cases
in
d.c.
take
2
or
3
years,
and
we
don't
think
these--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--judges
should
be
left--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--there
is
a
violation
of
the
act
now,
because
the
elections
went
forward
without
preclearance.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
there
still...
there
still
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
act,
because
state
officials
implemented
it.
now
you
may
hold
that
it
was
okay
for
the
district
court
to
let
it
go
forward,
but
there
still
was
a
violation
of
the
act
by
implementing
the
uncleared
change
absent...
by
implementing
the
uncleared
change.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
well,
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
and
set
aside
the
elections
now.
as
i
have
said,
if
the
state
ruled
tomorrow
you
might
not
have
to.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
the
court
certainly
could
hold
that
they
could
stand,
yes.
i
mean,
in
hampton
county
there
was
the
suggestion
that
even
if
changes
are
later
cleared,
prior
elections
held
under
those
changes
might
not
be
allowed
to
stand,
but
hampton
county
left
that
to
the
district
court.
but
the
point
is
we
would
have
to
wait,
we're
going
to
have
to
wait
probably
2
years
before
we
get
a
judgment
out
of
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
these
illegal
elections
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand
for
that
period
of
time.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
certainly
this
court
has,
and
for
instance
in
the
hampton
county
case,
applied
equitable
principles,
but
only
so
far
as
to
say
that
an
unprecleared
election
should
be
set
aside
if
the
attorney
general's
approval
is
denied.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
oh,
no,
not
at
all,
just
as
all
criminal
convictions
could
not
be
set
aside
now,
even
though
the
elections
were
held
in
violation
of
section
5.
