justice
kennedy
are
you
saying
in
this
hypothetical
that
there
are
two
questions?
one
is
the
ultimate
number.
the
other
is
the
mechanism
for
electing
that
number.
justice
kennedy
and
it's
the
second
that
you're
concerned
with,
and
it's
the
second
that
you
find
is
a
taint
that
will
not
go
away?
justice
kennedy
are
there
ever
reasons
for
a
district
court
not
to
enjoin
an
election
if
the
office
has
not
been
precleared?
justice
kennedy
well,
now,
that
was
one...
equitable
considerations,
i
take
it,
pertain?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
justice
kennedy
and
all
of
the
reasons
the
district
court
gave,
i
think
there
were
some
five
or
six,
were
just
improper
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
is
clark
versus
roemer
no.
90-952.
the
case
comes
to
us
under
our
appellant
jurisdiction
as
opposed
to
our
certiorari
jurisdiction.
it
involves
issues
under
section
five
of
the
voting
rights
act.
in
order
to
prevent
voting
changes
that
have
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect,
section
5
requires
covered
jurisdictions
such
as
louisiana
to
obtain
pre-clearance.
this
case
involves
the
administrative
pre-clearance
mechanism
in
which
before
implementing
new
voting
practices,
the
state
of
louisiana
was
required
to
obtain
approval
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
the
procedural
history
of
the
case
is
somewhat
complicated
in
this
detail
in
our
opinion.
in
essence,
the
case
involves
voting
changes
in
louisiana
which
the
attorney
general
refused
to
pre-clear.
despite
the
attorney
general’s
objections,
the
three-judge
district
court,
and
that
is
the
judgment
that
we
review
here,
held
that
some
of
the
electoral
changes
in
issue
were
pre-cleared
by
implication
when
the
attorney
general
pre-cleared
related
voting
changes
and
some
changes
at
a
later
date
than
the
ones
here
in
question.
the
court
also
refused
to
enjoin
elections
despite
certain
voting
changes
that
it
conceited
with
subject
to
valid
objections
by
the
attorney
general.
it
reasoned
that
because
the
harm
to
all
citizens
of
louisiana
from
the
injunction
would
outweigh
the
harm
of
allowing
the
elections
to
continue,
the
election
should
go
forward
and
the
winner
should
take
office
while
the
pre-clearance
procedures
were
still
ongoing.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse.
the
district
court
erred
by
not
enjoining
elections
for
judgeships
to
which
the
attorney
general
interposed
valid
objections.
unless
voting
changes
are
pre-cleared,
they
are
invalid
under
federal
law
and
unenforceable.
the
district
court’s
reasons
for
refusing
to
enjoin
these
elections
lack
merit.
both
the
court
and
the
state
had
notice
for
over
three
years
prior
to
the
election
that
the
seats
were
unprecleared.
the
court’s
concerned
about
voter
confusion
and
lower
voter
turn
out
and
special
elections
was
unjustified
for
voters
may
be
more
confused
and
inclined
to
avoid
the
polls
when
an
election
is
held
in
violation
of
federal
law.
moreover,
the
court’s
concern
to
avoid
invalid
state
court
judgments
counseled
in
favor
of
enjoining
the
elections
in
order
to
avert
a
federal
law
basis
to
challenge
the
state
judgments.
the
district
court
also
erred
we
think
in
ruling
that
the
attorney
general
precleared
by
implication
certain
electoral
changes.
our
decision
in
mccain
versus
lybrand
has
made
clear
that
submission
of
legislation
for
administrative
pre-clearance
under
section
5
defines
the
scope
of
the
pre-clearance
request.
under
normal
circumstances
a
submission
pertains
only,
to
identified
changes
in
that
legislation,
and
ambiguity
in
the
submission
must
be
construed
against
the
submitting
jurisdiction.
thus,
the
elections
held
for
these
seats
violated
section
5.
the
appellants
now
request
us
to
order
that
these
elections
be
set
aside
and
that
the
judges
be
removed.
this
is
not
a
proper
matter
for
us
to
consider
in
the
first
instance.
in
fashioning
its
decree
granting
relief
on
remand,
the
district
court
should
adapt
a
remedy
that
in
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
implements
the
mandate
of
section
5
in
the
most
equitable
and
practicable
manner
and
with
least
offense
to
its
provisions.
the
opinion
for
the
court
is
unanimous.
