justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
what
if
we
decide
that
the
election
was...
permissibly
went
ahead,
and
that
we
say
that
the
district...
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
did
not
need
to
enjoin
the
election.
do
we
have
to
decide
the
issue
you
have
just
been--
justice
white
--but
if
the
state
wins
in
the
d.c.,
all
of
these
judges
are
going
to
be
all
right?
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
well,
i
know.
i
know,
but
what
if
it's
precleared...
if
the
state
wins
right
across
the
board
all
of
these
judges,
the
ones
that
are
in
office
are
going
to
stay
in
office.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
i
know.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if...
you
mean
the
elections
would
still
be
declared
unconstitutional
if
the
state
wins
in
the
district
court
here
in
the
district?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
white
--but
if
the
state
wins
there's
going
to
be
no
violation
of
the
act.
justice
white
well,
not
if
we
hold
that...
not
if
we
hold
that
the
elections...
that,
just
as
a
matter
of
equity,
just
as
a
matter
of
equity
they
didn't
need
to
enjoin
the
election.
justice
white
well,
so
what
would
you
do
if
the
state
wins
in
the
district
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
that
all,
none
of
these
needed
to
be...
they
needed
to
be
precleared,
but
they
are
now
cleared,
you
still
think
we
would
have
to
go
back
and
set
aside
the
election?
justice
white
how
many
judges
are
involved
in
that
group?
justice
white
and
if
we
say
that
those
judges
have
never
been
precleared,
suppose
we
accept
your
argument...
i
take
you
are
going
to
argue
that?
justice
white
what
do
we
do
then
about
those
judges?
justice
white
i
suppose
the
state
would
just
amend
its
petition
in
the
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
white
now
what
about
the...
what
about
those
judicial
seats
that
now
have
incumbents
that
are
among
this
group?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you're
going
to
be
down
there
arguing
what
should
be
done.
so
what
should
be
done?
justice
white
is
that
what
you're
going
to
say
to
the
district
court?
[laughter]
justice
white
don't
decide
categorically,
just
be
with
us,
i
suppose?
justice
white
enjoin
them
what?
tell
the
judges
that...
hold
a
new
election,
or
what?
justice
white
doesn't
he
know
then
how
many
judges
there
are?
justice
white
well,
but
there
are
some
times
you
didn't
make
the
request.
justice
white
well,
when
you
knew
you
hadn't
precleared
the
sixth,
though?
justice
white
well,
didn't
you
have
to
certify
when
you
went
for
the
seventh
that
you
had
precleared
all
your
prior
changes?
justice
white
and
you
have...
those
aren't
included
in
the...
those
aren't
included
in
the...
your
action
here
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
white
why
haven't
you
gone
back
to
the...
now
that
the
attorney...
you
know
that
the
attorney
general
has
a
different
view
than
you
do,
why
haven't
you
asked
that
these
prior
uncleared
positions
be
cleared?
justice
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
white
so
does
he
say
what
the
consequence
is
to
his
refusal?
justice
white
i
would
have
thought
then
you
automatically
right
and
there
would
have
added
those
judges
to
your
action
in
the
district
court.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
that
was
before
lulac
was
decided.
justice
white
oh,
really?
justice
white
these
are
in
the
record?
justice
white
how
did
that
get
here?
justice
white
did
they
suggest
that
the
justice
department's
reasons
for
refusing
to
preclear
were
invalid
or
insufficient,
or
what?
justice
white
well,
what
business
did
this
particular
court
have
in...
did
they
say
these
judges,
they
said
these
judges
actually
had
been
precleared,
right?
justice
white
they
had
to
say
that?
justice
white
they
couldn't
say
as
an
original
matter
that
we
are
preclearing
them?
justice
white
and
what,
on
what
grounds
did
they
say
that?
justice
white
but
isn't
that
kind
of
funny
to
say
the
justice
department
had
actually
precleared
them
when
the
justice
department
now
says,
now
turns
down,
refuses
to
preclear
these
very
positions?
justice
white
as
a
matter
of
law?
