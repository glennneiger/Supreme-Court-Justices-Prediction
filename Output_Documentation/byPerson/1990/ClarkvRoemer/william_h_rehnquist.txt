justice

rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-952,
janice
clark
v.
charles
"buddy"
roemer.
mr.
mcduff.
chief
justice
rehnquist
answer
justice
white's
question.
what
would
be
the
situation
if
the
district
court
cleared
all
of
these
changes?
then
the
elections
could
stand,
could
they
not,
no
matter
when
that
opinion
came?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcduff.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's...
essentially
it's
a
question
of
state
law,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
if
louisiana
says...
suppose
louisiana...
maybe
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
a
civil
law
state
is
that
it
doesn't
recognize
the
de
facto
doctrine.
chief
justice
rehnquist
all
you
can
really
say
is
that
it's
not
inconsistent
with
the
voting
rights
act
to
give
de
facto
recognition
to
the
acts
of
these
judges?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
pugh,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
mr.
pugh?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
indicates
that's
the
reason
that
the
attorney
general
declined
to
preclear?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
really
would
upset
congress'
scheme,
though,
to
challenge
the
judicial
review
of
the
attorney
general
into
the
district
of
columbia,
wouldn't
it,
if
you
adopted
a
rule
like
that
that
said,
you
know,
for
gross
mistakes
a
three
judge
district
court
could
correct
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
don't
you
think
congress
intended,
albeit
by
a
de
novo
proceeding
rather
than
by
review
of
the
attorney
general's
act,
to
channel
judicial
determination
of
preclearances
in
the
district
of
columbia?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
would
think
you
probably
would.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
wonder
if
that
really
was
a
factual
determination.
i
agree
that
the
district
court
said
it
was,
but
what
they
said
in
fact
was
that
since
you
precleared
step
b,
you
impliedly
precleared
step
a.
isn't
that
what
it
amounted
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if...
that
really
isn't
a
question
of
fact.
it's
not
as
if
the
state
was
contending
that
we
got
a
letter
from
the
attorney
general
saying
yes,
it's
precleared,
and
the
attorney
general
says
no,
i
never
sent
the
letter.
this
is
basically
a
legal
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
now
addressing
yourself
to
a
question
raised
in
an
earlier
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
that's
probably
not
proper,
because
you
opponent
doesn't
have
any
opportunity
to
respond.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pugh.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
