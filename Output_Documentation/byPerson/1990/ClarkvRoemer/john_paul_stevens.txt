well,
is
that
precisely...
if
you
go
from
four
to
six,
say,
and
that's
a
bad
change,
and
that's
not
submitted,
and
then
you
go
from
six
to
seven
and
he
approves
six
to
seven.
he
doesn't
approve
a
number
of
seven,
he
approves
a
change
from
six
to
seven,
thinking
that
doesn't
have
an
effect.
and
if
he
then
finds
out
there
is
an
unapproved
prior
change
he
wipes
out
the
whole
thing,
but
they
then
could
resubmit
a
four
to
seven
change,
which
would
then
be
appraised
on
its
own
merits.
