mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
that
louisiana
added
additional
judges
because
louisiana
needed
additional
judges
for
caseload
management,
just
as
every
other
state
in
the
union
and
just
as
the
federal
system
needs
judges
from
time
to
time
for
caseload
management.
in
addition
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
that
louisiana
had
no
discriminatory
intent
in
adding
judges.
never
been
any
claim
that
any
of
these
judges
were
added
to
these
districts
because
louisiana
intended
to
discriminate
against
anybody.
further
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
that
the
justice
department
81
times
precleared
additional
judgeships
up
through
1988.
every
time
louisiana
requested
an
additional
judgeship
it
was
granted.
there
was
never
any
problem
with
it.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
were
times
when
we
did
not
make
a
request.
most
of
those
times
involved...
in
those
cases
we
didn't,
and
later
in
most
of
them
there
were
additional
judgeships
which
were
precleared.
the
example
set
forth
in
the
brief
is
in
caddo
parish,
my
home
parish,
where
there
were
four
judges
that
predated
the
voting
rights
act,
there
was
a
fifth
judge
added
who
was
precleared,
there
was
a
sixth
judge
added
who
was
not
precleared.
subsequently
we
went
back
to
them
for
seventh...
for
having
seven
judges,
no
problem,
eight
judges--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it
was
known,
your
honor.
the
record
really
isn't
clear
as
to
why
they
want
it.
given
the
random
nature
through
the
districts
and
given
the...
as
has
been
found--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--the
1987
regulations
provide
for
that,
your
honor.
all
of
these
were
pre-1987
submissions.
so
what
the
three-judge
court
held
on
these
situations
is
that
when
the
attorney
general
cleared
a
statute
creating
an
ultimate
number
of
judicial
seats
in
a
particular
district,
that
preclearance
constituted
approval
of
all
the
seats
necessary
to
reach
the
ultimate
number
of
judicial
positions
in
that
district.
the
case
is
very
different
from
the
mccain
v.
lybrand
case.
there
what
was
unprecleared
was
the
1966
total
change
in
the
form
of
government.
in
1971
there
were
additional
people
added,
and,
too,
and
there
were
changes
in
the
residency
districts.
and
that
was
precleared.
and
the
question
presented
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
in
the
brief
on
the
merits
by
the
appellants,
and
in
the
brief
by
the
united
states
is
did
this
subselentio
preclear
that
change
from
at
large,
and
the
court
said
no,
it
didn't.
but
that
situation
is
not
presented
here.
we
have
added
additional
judgeships
and
those
judges...
approval
of
those
additional
judgeships
constituted
approval
of
the
earlier
ones.
that's
the
only
logical,
the
way
to
look
at
it,
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
scalia.
otherwise,
to
take
my
example
of
caddo
parish,
we
might
be
left
with
five
judges
rather
than
nine,
and
maybe
not
even
that,
because
once
the
attorney
general
has
precleared
having
nine
judges,
but
not
the
sixth
judge,
by
their
theory,
if
we
go
back
to
four
judges
is
that
a
change?
it's
a
mess
with
any
other
approach.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
there
are
several
preclearance
submission
letters
in
the
record,
your
honor.
as
i
recall,
two
of
them
say
here
is
an
act,
and
the
others
say
that
we're
asking
for
a
preclearance
in
an
increase
in
judges.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
the
acts
included.
and
the
three-judge
court
found
as
a
fact,
which
of
course
for
this
court
to
overrule
it
would
have
to
hold
as
clearly
erroneous,
that
the
nature
of
the
louisiana
system
where
it
is
amended
and
reenacted,
and
the
nature
of
the
letters
submitted,
and
the
response
by
the
justice
department,
all
of
them
showed
that
the
justice
department
did
in
fact
preclear
this
by...
by
preclearing
the
later
number.
so,
as
i
said,
most
of
these
involve
that
situation.
i
believe
it
was
justice
white
who
asked
how
many
judges
are
affected.
there
are
25
seats
in
18
of
our
40
judicial
districts
where
there
was
a
later
judgeship
addition
precleared.
so
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
none
of
these,
that
the
three-judge
court
erred,
that
would
put
those
25
judges
in
danger,
serious
danger.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
no,
sir.
because
the
three-judge
court
held
that
those
were
precleared,
we
didn't
have
to
bring
them
up
there.
additionally,
they
also
were
complaining
about
the
first...
about
some
appellate
judges,
including
the
entire
first
circuit,
and
that's
12
judges,
plus
an
additional
four
judges,
all
of
which
the
three-judge
court
held
were
precleared.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
well,
we
have
now,
your
honor,
and
he
said
he
won't.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
and
let
me
move
into
that,
if
i
may
give
you
one
more
statistic
just
so
you'll
know
what's
involved
here.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
he
says
that
they
are
not
precleared
and
therefore
they
can't,
the
election
is
improper
and
those
judgeships--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--well,
what
happened,
your
honor,
is
we
went
back
to
the
attorney
general
and
asked
him
for
preclearance.
once
it
was
found
out
these
weren't
precleared--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--after
this
action
was
brought,
we
asked
him
for
preclearance
and
it
wasn't
granted.
and
then
the
three-judge
court
deemed
that
these
judges
were
precleared,
so
we
haven't
asked
that
the
d.c.
court
preclear
them
because
the
three-judge
court
has
precleared
them,
and
that
question
is
before
this
court.
obviously
if
this
court
holds
that
the
three-judge
court
erred
and
those
aren't
precleared,
i
am
sure
the
next
day
there
will
be
an
amendment
filed.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
but
as
of
this
point
we
didn't
ask
them
because
it
has
been
granted.
but
you
asked
why
the
attorney
general
disapproved
these,
and
the
problem...
and
that's
really
what's
the
issue
of
this
case,
and
mr.
mcduff
said
it.
what
matters
is
not...
and
i'll
quote
him
from
his
oral
argument
a
few
minutes
ago...
"what
matters
is
not
the
number,
what
matters
is
whether
we're
expanding
a
discriminatory
system.
"
"what
the
attorney
general
is
doing
is,
he
said
in
his
letters
time
and
again
we
don't
object
to
the
number
per
se,
of
judges
per
se.
"
"we
don't
object
that
you
need
additional
judges.
"
"they
don't
want
us
to
continue
electing
judges
under
our
current
system.
"
"but
that's
not
what
section
5
was
for.
"
"that's
not
what
congress
held
it
was--
"
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--well,
yes,
sir.
what
i
mean
is
that
louisiana
has
since
1946
elected
judges
at
large
by
designated
post.
that
predates
the
voting
rights
act.
louisiana
in
1976
put
in...
and
that
was,
also
we
adopted
it
in
the
louisiana
constitution,
which
was
precleared.
in
1976
louisiana
put
in
a
majority
vote
requirement
which
was
specifically
precleared
by
the
justice
department.
that
is
our
system
of
electing
judges.
and
81
times
that
system
was
approved,
as
we
tried
to
preclear
additional
judges.
now,
though,
they
won't
let
us
have
additional
judges--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--your
honor,
other
than
mr.
mcduff's
statement
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
will
cite
to
you
the
9/23/88
justice
department
letter,
it
is
refused
because
we
are
seeking
to
add
elective
judgeship
positions
under
an
election
system
found
to
violate
section
2.
i'll
cite
to
you
the
9/17/90
letter,
the
state
has
failed
to
adopt
a
racially
fair
election
system.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
well,
they
have
said
the
same
thing
since
lulac,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
in
fact
if
you
look
at
the
last
footnote
in
their
brief,
which
is
the
one
that
they
say
that
the
results
test
is
under
section
2(b),
not
2(a),
they
also
say
that
they
don't
intend
to
follow
what
this
court
does
in
lulac
and
chisom,
they
say
because
it's
a
separate
section.
it's
also
in
their
10/90
letter,
and
it's
in
their
11...
november
20
letter.
all
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
time
and
time
again.
they
don't...
they're
trying
to
make
us
change
what
we
have
and
what
has
been
precleared
and
what
preexists
1965.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
justice
department...
that
congress
enacted
section
5
to
get
at
changes
from
the
present
system.
that's
what
this
court
has
held
repeatedly.
and
if
the
justice
department
is
not
doing
that,
if
the
justice
department
is
using
it
for
an
improper
purpose,
that
doesn't
come
up
in
washington.
the
washington
proceeding
is
a
de
novo
proceeding,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
purpose
or
intent
to
discriminate.
no
review
absolutely
whatsoever
of
what
the
justice,
the
merits
of
the
justice
department's
procedure
and
whether
their
objection
was
proper.
it's
a
de
novo
proceeding.
i
think
this
court
at
this
time
can
review
it.
georgia
v.
united
states,
this
court
reviewed
the
attorney
general's
regulations
for
preclearances.
a
majority
of
the
court
said
they
are
fine,
a
minority
of
the
court
said
they
are
not.
but
all
of
you
agreed
you
could
review
his
regulations.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
that
was--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--that
was
a
three-judge
court
action
in
georgia,
your
honor.
it
was
not
a
d.c.
court
action.
additionally...
and
i
think
justice
white
wrote
in
his
dissent
in
that
case,
is
he
said
that
he
didn't
agree
with
the
regulations.
he
said
that
the
justice
department
does
not
have
uncontrolled
discretion
in
this
act.
that
if
the
justice
department
said
we're
going
to
refuse
to
preclear
additional
judgeships
because
we're
too
busy,
if
they
say
we're
going
to
only
approve
1
out
of
10,
if
they
say
we're
only
going,
that
we're
going
to
disapprove
them
all
because
it's
a
governor
of
another
political
persuasion,
that
that's
improper,
and
this
court
can
review
it.
and
i
think
it's
just
as
improper
for
them
to
use
section
5
for
a
purpose
that's
not
in
section
5.
and
i
think
this
court
can
review
that.
no
doubt
about
it.
this
is
a
three-judge
court
appeal
under
fuzzari
v.
steinberg.
the
whole
matter
comes
up
before
this
court.
so
i
think
they
can.
mr.
mcduff
also
talked
about
the
washington
proceeding,
that
the
one
reason
for
going
ahead
and
throwing
out
these
elections
is
it
may
take
2
or
3
years.
louisiana
has
already
filed
a
proceeding
in
washington
for
preclearance.
the
issue
has
been
joined
by
the
justice
department.
last
wednesday
afternoon
mr.
mcduff
filed
an
intervention
to
be
added
as
a
defendant,
and
last
thursday,
4
days
ago,
there
was
a
status
conference
in
that
washington
proceeding.
and
at
that
status
conference
louisiana
announced
it
would
be
filing
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
or
before
june
7.
it's
not
going
to
take
years,
or
if
it
does
it's
not
going
to
be
because
of
us.
the
basis
for
the
summary
judgment
proceeding
is
going
to
be
that
under
the
lockhart
case
and
under
the
beer
case
there
is
no
retrogressive
change.
this
court
held
in
lockhart
that
where
you...
keeping
the
system
the
same,
there
can
be
no
retrogression.
and
what's...
all
we
did
is
add
an
additional
judge.
we
didn't
change
the
method
that
he
was
elected.
we
didn't
suddenly
do
some
other
type
of
system.
the
other
problem
with
the
justice
department's
approach
in
attacking
our
election
system
is
they
say
fine,
louisiana,
we
don't
like
your
system.
and
again
i
think
that's
improper
under
section
5.
but
then
what
do
they
tell
us
to
do?
go
adopt
another
system.
and
section
5
wasn't
put
there
to
make
you
adopt
something
new,
and
particularly
not
the
sorts
of
things
that
it
asked
us
to
adopt,
the
same
sorts
of
things
that
it
wants
in
the
section
2
proceeding.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
the...
they
looked
at
the
submission
letters,
they
looked
at
the
responses
by
the
justice
department,
they
looked
at
louisiana
law
in
terms
of
amending
and
reenacting
statutes,
and
frankly--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--no,
sir.
because
frankly
at
that
point,
that
was
right
after...
i
think
it
needs
to
be
put
in
its
time.
they
did
say
in
a
footnote
that
what
the
justice
department
is
attacking
is
the
system,
they
are
not
attacking
the
number
of
judges.
so
they
understood
that
was
the
question.
they
did
not
say
whether
that
was
improper.
frankly,
at
the
time...
right
after,
or
right
before
that
decision
the
justice
department
said
we've
got
lulac
and
we're
still
studying
it.
we're
not
really
sure
what
it
means
and
what
it's
implication
is.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
that's
right.
they
said
they
had...
that
they
had
been
precleared.
i
think
they
could
have
said--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
they
looked...
several.
one
is
that
they
looked
at
the...
we
had
examples
of
submission
letters
and
we
had
examples
of
the
justice
department
responses,
and
we
also,
they
had
before
them
those,
as
well
as
the
nature
of
the
louisiana
acts
about
amending
and
reenacting
statutes.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
they
said
that
the
approval
of
a
later
position...
of
the
later
positions
and
the
later
increase
in
the
number
of
judges
constituted
preclearance,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
well,
actually
they
said
a
matter
of
fact
based
on
the,
both
the
nature
of
louisiana
submission
letters,
the
nature
of
the
justice
department
responses,
and
they
also
based
it
on
a
hearing,
your
honor.
and
there
again
at
that
hearing
the
justice
department
said
they
don't
care
about
the
numbers.
no
matter
what
information
you
show
us,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
add
any
more
judges.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
well,
they
were--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--well,
they
were
about
some
of
these,
your
honor.
not
every
letter
was
put
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it's
in
the--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
excuse
me.
they're
in
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
shortly
after
page
100.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
and
again,
what
they
said
is
they
want
us
to
adopt
limited
voting
or
cumulative
voting,
or
something
like
that
and--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
in
the
nature
of
this
statute
i
think
that's
questionable,
your
honor,
because
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
short,
60-day
approval
process.
and
for
them
to
say
we're
going
to
rewrite
the
statute
and
make
it
say
something
it
doesn't
mean,
wait
until
it
goes
up
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court
and
come
back
down,
and
meanwhile
you
can't
have
any
election
of
judges,
i
don't...
i
think
that
goes
beyond
the
intent
of
the,
what's
supposed
to
be
a
quick
procedure
under
section
5.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
additionally
given
that
they
have
conceded
they
have
no
problem
with
the
addition
of
the
number,
that
all
that
they
don't
like
is
the
fact
we
elect
them
in
louisiana
at
large
by
designated
post,
i
think
they
have
conceded...
now
i
guess
one
could
argue
that
maybe
they
could
try
to
show
some
discriminatory
intent,
but
i
think
that's
something
that
they
could
have
done
before.
we
submitted
them
and
then
we
resubmitted
them,
and
then
on
the
basis
of
lulac
we
asked
that
they
re-reconsider
them.
and
they
said
each
time
no,
and
they
said
it
over
and
over
for
the
same
reason.
the
justice
department
doesn't
have
any
other
reason.
there's
no
intent
issue
here.
it
has
never
been
raised.
no
problem
with
having
the
additional
judges.
it's
just
that
they
don't
like
our
system.
and,
as
i
say,
they
suggest
that
we
go
to
limited
voting,
but
most
of
the
examples
here
it's
one
judgeship
within
a
district
that
was
not
approved.
and
how
can
you
have
limited
voting
for
one
judgeship?
the
whole
notion
is
that
you...
of
limited
voting
is
there
are
eight
at
issue
and
you
can
only
vote
for
two
or
three
of
them.
where
there
is
one
there
is
no
way
to
limit,
to
have
limited
voting.
there
is
no
way
to
have
cumulative
voting,
because
there
is
nothing
to
cumulate.
and
even
where
there
are
two
or
three,
what
would
that
do
to
us?
it
would
give
us
a
system
where
some
of
the
judges
or...
reelect
all
the
judges...
excuse
me,
elect
some
of
the
judges
all
the
time,
and
the
rest
of
the
judges
part
of
the
time,
in
that
you
have
the
old
system
for
all
the
existing
judges,
but
for
any
new
judges
you've
got
something
like
limited
voting.
so
you've
got
to
know
that
for
positions
one
through
five
you
can
check
each
of
them,
but
positions
six
through
eight
you
may
not
be
able
to.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
well,
what...
the
justice
department
suggested
that
as
a
remedy.
what
limited
voting
is,
your
honor,
is
that
let's
say
that...
and
they're
suggesting
the
section
2
context
also.
let's
say
that
there
are
eight
seats
at
issue.
if
you
can
only
vote
for
two
of
those
seats
or
three
of
those
seats,
then
statistically
speaking
if
the
minority
population
is
a
particular
percentage
then
they
are
guaranteed
proportional,
you
know,
to
have
that
number
elected.
and
cumulative
voting,
if
you
have
eight
seats,
then
they
could
cast
all
eight
votes
for
one
judge,
or
four
votes
for
two
judges,
or
whatever.
it's
a
way
to
get
proportional
representation.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
no,
ma'am.
that's
another
suggestion
they
had,
but
i
don't
know
how
you
would
subdistrict
one...
say
you
are
going
to
elect
all
of
them
at
large
except
this
one
that
you
subdistrict.
and
of
course,
all
these
are
anathema
to
the
american
system.
there
is
nothing
anywhere
suggesting,
there
are
200...
it
came
up
in
this
case
in
the
section
2
aspects
of
the
clark
case,
there
are
200
jurisdictions
out
of
86,000
in
this
country
that
use
limited
voting.
and
if
congress
wanted
to
impose
that
on
the
judiciary
in
section
2,
section
5,
or
some
other
section,
then
they
would
have
said
so.
they
would
have
discussed
that.
that's
part
of
the
problem
with
this
whole
business.
obviously
everybody
is
uncomfortable
with
subdistricting
judges
because
it
brings
one-man
one-vote
in,
which
thornburg
v.
gingles
is
a
one-man
one-vote
test.
no
doubt
about
it.
and
so
then
they
come
up
with
these
other
remedies,
limited
voting,
cumulative
voting.
but
this,
congress
surely
would
have
thought
about
putting
something
so
different
that
we
don't
even
have
much
in
america.
they
do
have
it
in
japan,
and
i
think
they
have
it
partially
in
spain.
if
i
may
turn
to,
for
a
minute
to
the
question
about
the
elections,
whether
or
not
these
elections
ought
to
be
overturned.
let's
say,
which
we
hope
you
don't
do,
this
court
determines
that
we
erred,
that
there
was
error
below
in
terms
of
preclearing
these
positions.
this
court
said
time
and
time
again
that
it
will
allow
a
jurisdiction
to
go
to
washington
to
seek
approval.
it
said
in
perkins
v.
matthews,
it
said
it
in
berry
v.
doles,
it
said
it
in
hampton
county.
most
recently...
really
what
this
order
is
modeled
on
in
this
case,
the
150
days,
the
order
says
that
we
go
to
washington
for
approval,
and
if
approval
isn't
obtained
up
in
the
washington
district
court
and
appeals
therefrom,
that
there's
150
days
after
that
action
is
over
with
these
judges
are
kicked
out
of
office.
that's
the
exact
same
order
that
was
done
in
the
brooks
case.
and
that
order
came
up
to
this
court
also,
just
as
this
court...
this
court
did
summarily
affirm
brooks
in
its
entirety,
which
included
that
order
which
was
specifically
complained
of
by
the
plaintiffs
there.
so
we
think
that
it
would
be,
that
the
elections
ought
to
stand.
we
think
that,
as
we
have
said,
that
some
of
these
judgeships
have
been
precleared,
and
the
ones
that
have
not
been
precleared
we
ought
to
be
going
to
washington
for
those,
and
that
up
there...
we
believe
they
are
going
to
be
precleared
based
on
the
lockhart
case,
that
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
this
court
has
said
that
what
we're
concerned
about
in
section
5
is
whether
there's
a
retrogressive
change.
and
when
you've
got,
as
in
caddo
parish,
you
add
that
sixth
judge,
he
is
elected
the
same
way
as
the
other
five,
that
can't
be
a
retrogressive
change.
it's
a
continuation
of
the
system.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
what
can
they
make?
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
i
think
if
the
justice
department
says
mistakenly
that
we
intended
discrimination
when
we
did
not,
that
that's
a
de
novo
matter
that
goes
to
washington.
i
think--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--i
think
if
the
justice
department
makes
a
decision
erroneously
on
the
facts
in
terms
of
effects
it
would
make
the
same,
your
honor.
what...
the
problem
with
their
argument
here
is
where
it's
manifestly
beyond
the
reach
of
the
statute
that
that's
something
that...
that's
what
this
court's--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--i
don't...
i
wouldn't
make
it
that
broad.
i
think
that
if
it's
a
mistake...
there
are
minor
mistakes
and
there
are
major
mistakes.
and
i
think
that
where
section
5
so
clearly
states
that
it
is
to...
where
there
are
changes
from
the
present
system
that
are
retrogressive,
and
yet
the
justice
department
uses
it
to
attack
the
present
system,
that
that's
so
manifestly
beyond
the
scope
of
section
5
that
that
can
be
reviewed.
it's,
as
justice
white
said,
if
they
said
we're
going
to
preclear
1
out
of
10.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
of
course
you
adjoined
that
dissent
about
the
example
that
i
gave.
i
guess
i
would
state
that,
number
one.
number
two,
again,
the
district
of
columbia
proceeding
is
not
a
review
of
the
attorney
general
proceeding.
you
have
two
avenues.
you
can
ask
the
attorney
general
for
administrative
preclearance,
or
you
can
go
to
the
district
court.
but
if
you
go
here
to
the
attorney
general,
you
can
still
go
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
but
as
a
de
novo
proceeding.
it
doesn't
review
what
he
did
at
all.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
i
don't
think
congress
envisioned
that
the
justice
department
was
going
to
ignore
this
court's
decisions
about
what
section
5
involves.
and
i
think
had
congress
envisioned
that
they
would
say
it
could
come
up
here.
it
cannot
come
up
in
washington.
it's
a
de
novo
consideration.
so
there's
no
way
to
review
what
they
did.
and
they
can
continue
to
hold
us
hostage.
i
mean,
let's
assume
we
win
in
washington,
these
judgeships
are
precleared.
next
year
we
want
to
add
another
judge.
uh-huh.
your
system,
we
don't
like
it,
we're
not
going
to
preclear
it.
we
got
to
go
back
to
washington.
now
maybe
we'll
get
a
faster
summary
judgment
in
washington.
there
is
that
possibility.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
but,
you
know,
they
have
made
the
same
argument
and
they
lost
in
the
d.c.
court
on
the...
in
the
mississippi
case
that,
you
know,
wasn't
a
retrogressive
change.
and
yet
they're
continuin
to
make
it.
i
mean,
this
court...
i
just
think
this
court's
decisions
in
the
section
5
is
absolutely
clear,
and
they
are
doing
it.
there's...
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
judicial
review,
in
fact
there
isn't,
of
their
decision
in
washington.
i
think
if
they're
going
to
be
held
accountable
at
all,
then
they
are
going
to
have
to
be
held
accountable
by
this
court
reviewing
this
sort
of
decision.
now,
again,
you
don't
have
to...
maybe
i
shouldn't
say
this,
but
you
don't
have
to
take
that
step
here
in
that
the
three-judge
court
held
as
a
matter
of
fact,
which
you've
got
to
find
clearly
erroneous
to
overturn,
that
judgeships
were
precleared.
you
don't
have
to
do
that,
but
frankly
i
think
you
ought
to
do
that.
i
think--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--well,
that's...
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
in
mccain
v.
lybrand
this
court
held
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous
in
determining
that
preclearance
of
the
71
act
precleared
the
1966
act.
that
was
the
standard
y'all
applied
in
the
mccain
case.
and
so
i
think
if
it's...
if
that's
the
standard
you
applied
there
as
to
review
of
the
decision
you
would
be
applying
the
same
standard
here.
and
again,
if
you,
their
opinion
talks
about,
you
know,
the
facts
that
they
found
based
on
what
they
saw.
so
i
believe
it
would
be
proper.
additionally,
the...
another
matter
that
was
raised
is
whether
or
not
the,
de
facto
these
people
could
continue
to
serve.
judge
politz
wrote
an
opinion
in
chisom
v.
roemer
where
there
was
an
attempt
to
enjoin
the
supreme
court
justice
election,
and
there
he
pointed
out
that
our
research
reflects
no
case
where
the
louisiana
supreme
court's
applied
to
a
judge
or
justice
a
question
of
what
do
you
do
when
there's
a
vacancy
and
that
those
are
uncharted
areas.
finally,
if
i
may,
i
am
counsel
of
record
in,
also
in
the
section
2
case.
i
want
to
respond
to
one
thing
you
said,
justice
scalia,
about
participate
in
political
processes,
whether
or
not
that
expanded
beyond
elect
legislatives
of
the
choice,
and
if
you
look
again--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
well,
i
won't
if
that...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well
thank...
thank
you,
your
honor.
