justice
stevens
mr.
day,
may
i
ask
you...
i'm
sorry,
did
i...
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about...
that
always
puzzled
me
about
this
case?
as
i
understand
it,
at
the
time
the
district
judge
made
the
finding
of
unitariness,
he
did
not
vacate
the
outstanding
decree?
justice
stevens
was
the
school
board,
therefore,
still
bound
by
the
decree?
justice
stevens
that
he
in
effect
vacated
the
decree?
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
the
decree
had
remained
in
effect,
it
is
clear,
is
it
not,
that
the
return
to
neighborhood
schools
for
the
younger
children
was
a
violation
of
the
decree?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
and
it
had
a
provision
in
it
to
go
in
and
ask
for
a
modification.
but
it
also
said
in
so
many
words,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
will
not
deviate
from
whatever
the
name
of
the
plan
was
without
the
prior
approval
of
the
court?
justice
stevens
so
that
one
of
the
questions,
i
guess,
is
whether
the
decree
was
still
in
effect?
justice
stevens
well,
it
doesn't
say
that,
though.
it
just
says
it
does
not
have
a
termination
point
within
the
terms
of
the
decree
itself.
justice
stevens
do
you
know
why
he
didn't
go
ahead
and
vacate
the
decree
when
he
made
the
finding?
justice
stevens
may
i
question
the...
i'm
sorry.
you
mentioned
the
timing
going
back
to
'61,
but
is
it
not
true
that
in
'72,
when
he
imposed
the
plan,
he
found
that
up
until
that
date
the
board
had
been
recalcitrant
and
deliberately
refused
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
desegregation,
so
isn't
the
relevant
period
from
1972
to
1977?
maybe
that's
enough.
but
isn't
that--
justice
stevens
--but
they
were
totally
unpersuasive
to
him,
as
of
1972?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
mr.
chambers,
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
i
want
to
be
sure
on
your
position
on
this.
your
opponents
take
the
position
that
the
decree
was,
in
effect,
vacated
and
no
longer
binding
on
the
school
board
after
the
'77
finding.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stevens
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
in
response
to
your
opponent's
argument
that
the
judge's
understanding,
the
parties'
understanding
was
that
the
decree
would
no
longer
be
in
effect?
