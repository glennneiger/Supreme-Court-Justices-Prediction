chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
89-1080,
the
board
of
education
of
oklahoma
city
public
schools
v.
robert
l.
dowell.
mr.
day.
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
starr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
mr.
chambers,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
that
testimony
accredited,
believed
by
the
district
court?
is
there
some
way
to
tell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
don't
know
whether
the
district
court
believed
or
disbelieved,
though,
the
witness
you
referred
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
definition
do
you
use
of
segregated,
mr.
chambers?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
you...
you
say
that
a
school
today
in
oklahoma
city
if
it
has
majority
black
students
at
it,
what
else
does
it
need
to
be
segregated
under
your
definition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
sir,
assume
there's
no
doubt
that
the
schools
were
segregated
by
law
at
one
time.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
even
though
there
are
no
racial
restrictions
on
the
attendance
at
schools
in
oklahoma
city,
you
say
it's
segregated
because,
what,
because
there
are
a
majority
of
black
students
attending
now?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
free
to
argue
that?
i
thought
the
finding
of
unitariness
was
a
finding
that
there
are
no
vestiges.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
chambers,
you
referred
to
the
swift
case,
and,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
heavily
on
that.
you
think
that
principle
is
applicable
here,
that
the
injunction
against...
what
was
it,
meat
packers
there...
should
be
treated
in
the
same
way
as
the
injunction
against
the
school
board
here?
you
have
to
show
a
grievous
wrong,
unforeseen
conditions
in
order
to
set
aside
the
decree?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
think
there
should
be
any
difference
in...
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
presumably
a
preference
for
local
regulation
of
education,
other
things
being
equal,
whereas
i
don't
know
there's
any
preference
for
meat
packers.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you...
do
you
think
swift
is
consistent
with
the
idea
that
when
the
violation
has
been
cured
it
goes
back
to
local
control?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
page
citation
for
what
you're
about
to
say?
or
maybe
you
could
furnish
it
later.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
chambers.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
day,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
you
have
two
minutes
remaining?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
day.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
89-1080,
board
of
education
of
oklahoma
city
versus
dowell.
in
this
case,
black
students
and
their
parents
challenged
the
oklahoma
city
school
board's
decision
to
assign
students
in
grades
one
through
four
to
neighborhood
school.
in
earlier
proceedings,
oklahoma
city
was
found
to
have
intentionally
discriminated
and
to
have
created
a
dual
system
with
separate
schools
for
blacks
and
whites.
in
1972,
the
district
court
entered
a
decree
imposing
a
school
desegregation
plan
on
the
board
of
education.
in
1977,
finding
that
the
school
district
had
achieved
unitary
status,
the
court
issued
an
order
terminating
the
case.
in
1984,
the
board
adapted
the
plan
to
reassign
students
in
grades
one
through
four
to
neighborhood
schools.
this
resulted
in
a
number
of
previously
desegregated
schools
returning
to
primarily
one-race
school.
the
district
court
held
that
this
was
a
permissible
action
on
the
part
of
the
board.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court.
it
said
that
a
desegregation
decree
remains
in
effect
until
a
school
district
can
show
grievance
wrong
evoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
contentions,
and
that
the
circumstances
in
oklahoma
city
had
not
changed
enough
to
justify
modification
of
the
1972
decree.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
its
test
for
dissolving
a
desegregation
decree
is
more
stringent
than
is
required
by
either
this
court's
decision
dealing
with
injunctions,
or
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
school
desegregation
decree
is
not
intended
to
operate
forever
for
federal
supervision
of
local
systems
always
has
been
intended
as
a
temporary
measure
to
remedy
past
discrimination.
the
legal
justification
for
displacing
local
authority
in
such
cases
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
dissolving
such
a
decree
after
local
authorities
have
operated
in
compliance
with
it
for
a
reasonable
period
is
proper.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
marshall,
joined
by
justices
blackmun
and
stevens,
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
souter
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
