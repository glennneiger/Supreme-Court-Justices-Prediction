the

do
you?

how
are
they
harmed
by
it?
justice

they
are
party
to
this
suit?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
yes.
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
school
board.
the
school
board
is
required
to
follow
the
constitution--
justice
marshall
--and
that's
all
they're
required
to
do.
justice
marshall
and
they
object
to
that?
justice
marshall
well,
what
is--
justice
marshall
--what
assurance
do
i
have
that
the
school
board
will
continue
to
operate
pursuant
to
this
order?
justice
marshall
well,
that's
what--
justice
marshall
--that's
what
the
order
says,
but
if
you
take
the
order
away,
what
assurance
do
i
have
that
the
school
board
will
continue
to
follow
the
constitution?
justice
marshall
you'll
have
to
file
a
new
lawsuit.
justice
marshall
general...
general
starr,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
in
oklahoma
city
the
dismantling
was
done
by
putting
it
on
residence
rather
than
race
but
the
poor
afro-american
kids
were
still
in
the
same
school?
justice
marshall
the
dismantling
was
in
changing
the
reason?
is
that
your
position?
justice
marshall
does
school
stay
the
same?
does
it
still
stay
a
negro
school?
justice
marshall
but
does
it
still
remain
a
segregated
school?
justice
marshall
then
it's
a
still
a
segregated
school,
and
you
don't
think
segregation
is
unconstitutional?
