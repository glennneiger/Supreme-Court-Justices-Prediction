justice
kennedy
i
take
it
that
part
of
the
definition
of
a
unitary
system
is
a
plan
that's
operated
over
some
period
of
time
in
the
unitary
status,
is
it
not?
it's
not
something
that's
either
achieved
or
not
achieved
at
one
particular
moment
that
we
can--
justice
kennedy
--and
does
that
mean
that
perceptions
are
important,
perceptions
of
the
community,
perception
of
the
students?
justice
kennedy
so
this
case
is
in
part
about
perceptions?
justice
kennedy
but
does
the
fact
that
the
schools
became
identifiably...
or
would
become
identifiably
black
in
some
neighborhoods
under
the
student
reassignment
plan...
does
that
mean
that
the
finger
plan
didn't
work?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
well,
there
was
a
finding
in
an
earller
decree,
wasn't
there,
that
residential
segregation
was
in
part
caused
by
the
de
jure
violation?
justice
kennedy
does
that
mean
the
vestige
can
never
be
eliminated
or
that
it's
not
a
vestige?
justice
kennedy
mr.
starr,
what
did
the
busing
in
the
period
1972-1988
accomplish?
justice
kennedy
and
yet,
we
have
11
schools
that
will
become
black
again,
and
they're
the
same
schools
that
were
black
before.
so
it
would
seem
to
me
either
that
busing
didn't
work
at
all
or
that
it
has
to
continue.
justice
kennedy
but
it's
your
position
that
by
adopting
the
neighborhood
assignment
plan
this
really
reinstates
matters
to
where
it
was,
say,
in
1966
before?
justice
kennedy
and
then
it
follows
that
busing
over
all
these
years
has
done
almost
nothing
to
eliminate
the
causes
and
the
effects
of
segregation?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
the
neighborhood
pattern
is
just
the
same
and
if
your
goal
is
to
affect
the
neighborhood
pattern,
then
what's
busing
accomplished?
justice
kennedy
i
understand.
justice
kennedy
was
the
board's
determination
of
parental
involvement
based
on
the
fact
that
the
parental
involvement
would
be
much
more
likely
if
there
were
neighborhood
schools?
justice
kennedy
so
then
your
last
summary
was
not
quite
consistent
with
the
finding
of
facts
by
the
district
court
in
that
one
respect,
it
seems
to
me,
counsel.
justice
kennedy
can
i
ask
you
to
help
me
out?
do
you
suppose
there's
a
city
or
town
in
the
country
where
there
are...
are
predominantly
black
schools
and
predominantly
white
schools
who
wouldn't
be
vulnerable
to
a
desegregations
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
are
there
cities
in
the
country
where
there
are
predominantly
black
schools
and
white
schools
where
you
could
not
successfully
claim
that
it's...
that
it's
the
result
of
state
action?
justice
kennedy
but
you
say...
you
say
oklahoma
city
should
not
be
treated
like
one
of
those
cities?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
argument
is,
of
course,
that...
is
that
official
segregation
is
a
thing
of
the
past
and
this
has
achieved
unitary
status,
and
oklahoma
city
ought
to
be...
ought
to
be
treated
with
a
city
with
de
facto
segregation.
justice
kennedy
but
you're
operating
in
an
environment
in
which
any
family,
assuming
the
economic
ability,
can
move
to
any
district
in
the
city
and
go
to
any
neighborhood
school
that
it
wants,
and
that
is
different.
justice
kennedy
and
that
assumes
the
ability
to
change,
which
is
a
difficult
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
mr.
chambers.
i
guess
i'll
have
to
ask
you.
the
respondent
does
not,
as
i
understand
it,
propose
a
definition
of
unitary.
the
sg,
the
solicitor
general,
proposes
one.
the
great
schools
amicus
brief
proposes
one.
am
i
correct
that
you,
the
respondents,
think
there
is
no
particular
definition
of
unitary?
justice
kennedy
that
was
part
of
their
unitary...
the
unitary
definition?
