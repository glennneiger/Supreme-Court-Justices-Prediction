mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
over
a
generation
ago
this
court
handed
down
its
landmark
decisions
in
brown
v.
board
of
education.
in
its
second
decision
in
that
case,
the
court
made
clear
that
the
federal
courts
are
duty
bound
to
employ
their
broad,
remedial
powers
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
school
children
guaranteed
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
now
35
years
after
brown
ii,
literally
hundreds
of
school
districts
across
the
country
continue
to
operate
under
federal
court
decrees,
many
of
which
were
entered
in
the
late
1960's
and
the
early
1970's.
indeed,
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
almost
500
such
cases
across
the
nation.
throughout
this
long
process
of
desegregation,
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
proceeded
on
the
basis
of
an
assumption.
the
assumption
is
that
federal
judicial
power
terminates
when
it
has
achieved
its
purpose,
and
that
purpose
is
when
a
previously
unconstitutional
dual
system
has
been
dismantled.
that
assumption,
we
believe,
is
sound.
it
was
an
assumption
expressly
contemplated
in
brown
ii
itself,
where
the
court
spoke
of
the
process
of
federal
court
supervision
being
a
transitional
one.
and
this
much
seems
to
us
clear,
notwithstanding
the
court
of
appeals'
view
to
the
contrary.
but
the
court
of
appeals'
error,
with
all
respect,
which
seems
clear
enough,
should
not
obscure
the
real
difficulty
that
is
confronting
the
lower
courts
in
these
cases;
and
that
is,
as
the
questions
this
morning
have
suggested,
when
has
a
unitary
system
been
achieved?
that
threshold
question
is
one
that
we
believe
deserves
to
be
answered
for
the
benefit
of
those
hundreds
of
school
districts
and
for
the
guidance
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
united
states
district
courts.
in
our
view,
this
court's
decision
over
20
years
ago
in
green
v.
county
school
board
points
the
way
most
clearly.
there,
the
court,
speaking
through
justice
brennan,
looked
to
the
six
components
of
a
school
system
ranging
from
student
assignment
and
faculty
hiring
and
staff
hiring
to
physical
facilities,
extracurricular
activities,
and
transportation
to
see
whether
racial
discrimination
has
been
eradicated
root
and
branch
from
the
system.
how
does
a
system
come
into
compliance
with
the
green
factors?
in
our
view,
the
principal
way
is
by
the
good-faith
compliance
with
a
desegregation
plan
that
has
after
all
been
put
in
place
for
the
very
purpose
of
achieving
unitariness,
of
effecting
a
dismantling
of
the
dual
system.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
o'connor,
i
think
green
itself
suggests
that
factors
such
as
residential
segregation
cannot
in
any
meaningful
sense
be
considered
a
vestige
once...
once
there
has
been
good-faith
compliance
with
a
desegregation
plan.
we
look
to
the
components
of
the
school
system
over
which
a
school
board
and
school
authorities
have
control.
for
obvious
reasons,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
swann,
as
it
noted
more
emphatically
in
spangler,
the
school
board
has
no
realistic
control
over
where
people
determine
to
live.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
believe
the
latter.
i
believe
that
once
there
has
been
a
desegregation
plan
that
has
been
operating
on
the
short
side
for
3
years...
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
the
youngblood
case
suggests
that
as
a
minimum...
once
that
has
been
in
effect
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
then,
yes,
i
think
that
the
board
has
done
all
that
it
realistically
can
as
long
as
it
does
not
violate
the
constitution
by
any
action
outside
the
plan
that
might
in
fact
contribute.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
certainly
accomplished
the
dismantling
of
a
school
assignment
or
student
assignment
plan
that
was
infected
with
invidious
racial
discrimination.
it
took
down,
in
effect,
the
signs
over
school
doors
that
labeled
schools
on
racial
grounds.
it
also,
by
virtue
of
other
factors
as
well,
contributed
to
what
the
district
judge
found
to
be
very
substantial
residential
integration.
but
there
are--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
i
think
it
worked
in
the
sense
of
dismantlement.
that
is
to
say,
it
took
the
official
sanction
of
the
state's
imprimatur
away
from
that
school,
and
there
are
now
assignments
on
the
basis
of
residence
and
not
race,
and
coupled...
and
i
think
this
is
important,
this
court
emphasized
its
importance
in
swann...
with
a
majority-to-minority
transfer
program
which
assures
that
any
school
child
in
oklahoma
city
can
attend
another
school.
no
one
is
assigned
on
grounds
of
race.
and
i
think
ultimately
the
difficulty
with,
if
i
may
say
so,
undue
emphasis
upon
the
numbers
is
that,
first
of
all,
it
goes
beyond,
quite
beyond,
what
swann
itself
contemplated.
it
contemplated
numbers
as
a
starting
point
in
fashioning
a
desegregation
plan,
not
at
the
end
of
the
process.
that
starting
point
in
oklahoma
city
was
18
years
ago.
counting
by
race
is
something
that
is
a
very
serious
act
for
this
state
to
do,
and
it
should
not,
in
fact,
do
that
once
a
desegregation
plan
has
been
in
effect
and
has,
in
fact,
been
efficacious.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
true.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
not.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
i
don't
think
so,
with
all
due
respect.
i
think
what
this
court
was
emphasizing
in
swann
is
the
importance
of,
in
fact,
dismantling
schools
that
have
been
racially
identifiable
not
by
virtue
of
demographics
but
by
virtue
of
state
action,
state
action
assigning
school
children
by
virtue
of
their
race.
with
respect
to
majority-to-minority
transfer
provisions,
that
is
a
decision
that
parents
make
on
their--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--justice
marshall--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it's
not,
and
if
i
failed
to
be
clear
i
do
want
to
be
clear
on
this
point.
it's
fundamental.
the
dismantling
occurred
by
virtue
of
the
substantial
good-faith
compliance
with
a
desegregation
plan
that
was
fashioned
in
response
to
this
court's
mandate
in
green
to
fashion
a
plan
that
will
work
and
will
work
now,
and
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--not
by
virtue
of
state
action.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
by
virtue
of
residential
segregation,
it
does.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
with
all
respect,
justice
marshall,
that
is
emphatically
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
any
form
of
state-imposed
segregation
runs
plainly
afoul
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
that--
