mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
the
oklahoma
city
school
district
can
now
resegregate
10
black
elementary
schools
that
are
located
in
a
black
residential
area
the
district
court
found
was
created
by
state
action,
including
the
practices
of
this
school
district.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no.
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
plan
itself,
the
majority-to-minority
transfer
provision
provides
that
one
can
go
to
only
a
designated
school,
and
if
the
student
selects
that
school
and
is
selected
the
board
will
provide
transportation.
one
can
request
transfer
to
another
school
and
provide
his
or
her
own
transportation.
that
is
not
the
type
of
free,
open
transportation
that
the
court
is...
that
we
are
talking
about.
additionally,
your
honor,
we
have
some
major
problems
with
the
majority-minority
transfer
provision
as
a
means
for
correcting
past
and
present
discrimination.
this
court
condemned
in
green
transfer
provisions
that
were
designed...
free
transfer
provisions
that
were
designed
as
a
means
for
desegregating
schools.
it
simply
doesn't
work.
and
we
have
testimony
in
the
record
here
that
nobody
expects
this
majority-majority...
majority-minority
transfer
provision
to
correct
the
segregated
schools
we
have
in
this
residential
area.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
but
there's
no
way...
there's
nothing
else
that
would
support
a
court
finding
that
the
majority-minority
transfer
provision
will
correct
the
segregation
of
the
schools
in...
in
this
residential
district.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
oh,
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
the
record
there's
no
finding
by
the
court
one
way
or
the
other
in
terms
of...
of
whether
this
provision
would
correct
the
past
discrimination.
of
course,
that
one
could
transfer
out.
but
the
court,
looking
at
the
record,
will
see
that
there
are
limits
to
which
one
can
request
transfer
and
also
can
see
that
no
one
expects...
the
board
will
contend
that
it
would
desegregate
the
schools.
the
practical
effects
here,
your
honor,
are
that
you
don't
have
the
accommodation
at
these
schools
to
accept
all
the
students
who
would
be
able
to
transfer
if
you
were
desegregating
those
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--we
think
swann
demands
where
we
have
a
segregated
school
system
like
we
have
in
oklahoma
city,
that
the
board
take
steps
affirmatively
to
desegregate
those
schools.
we
think
that
comes
from
green,
and
we
think
the
court
made
that
clear
in
swann.
and
we
do
not
think
it's
appropriate
to
leave
it
here
where
we
have
returned
by
this
school
district
to
the
same
segregated
schools
that
were
involved
when
we
were
litigating
this
case
in
1961--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--yes,
your
honor,
because
we
have
the
segregated
community
that
the
state
helped
to
create.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
we
have
testimony
on
record
that
no
one
expects
whites
to
move
into
this
district.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
segregated
meant
that--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--your
honor,
segregated
means
that
the
board
is
pursuing
practices
which
perpetuate
racially
segregated
schools,
and
that's
what
we
have
here
in
oklahoma
city,
and
that's
what...
you
cannot
find
these
schools
not
segregated
if
you
apply
swann,
if
you
apply
green.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
schools
that
have
been
created
with
a
racial
identity
through
practices
of
a
state.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
if
the
past
practices
of
the
board
created,
perpetuated
that
racial
identity,
that
is,
in
my
definition,
a
segregated
school.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct,
and
there's
no
doubt
that
they...
that
segregation
was
perpetuated
by
practices
of
the
board.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i'm
saying
it's
segregated
because
the
vestiges
of
the
past
practices
of
the
board
continue
to
be
active
today
so
that
the
board's
practices
in
drafting
a
student
assignment
plan
on
that
residential
area
perpetuates
the
racial
identity
of
the
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
address
that.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
i'd
like
to
address
both
of
those
issues.
first
with
respect
to...
thank
you.
first
with
respect
to
whether
the
1977
order
found
a
unitary
system
and
directed
that
the
junction
be
dismissed,
i
asked
the
court
to
look
at
the...
that
order
itself.
the
court
said
simply
it
found
that
through
the
use
of
the
finger
plan
the
board
had
desegregated
students
and
teachers
and
had
eliminated
other
discriminatory
practices
in
the
system.
the
board
did
not
ask
the
court
to
dismiss
the
injunction.
the
board
came
in
and
promised
that
it
would
continue
to
use
the
finger
plan
because
everybody
knew
that
because
of
these
practices
of
the
past
to
permit
the
board
to
go
back
to
a
neighborhood
zone
would
simply
resegregate
the
elementary
schools.
so
when
the
court
overruling
it
said
it
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
board
would
now
abandon
the
finger
plan.
so
we
don't
have
a
court
in
1977
finding
a
unitary
system
in
the
sense
that
we
would
define
and
think
a
unitary
system
should
be
defined.
we
certainly
do
not
have
the
court
dismissing
the
injunction
in
1977,
so
that
injunction
remains
in
effect:
continue
to
use
the
finger
plan.
and
in
1987
when
the
court
was
looking
at
the
system
and
said
that
the
system
was
unitary,
it
again,
in
our
view,
used
a
patently
insufficient
definition
for
unitary.
it
said
that
because
the
board
had
followed
the
finger
plan,
which
it
had
found
in
1977
had
produced
the
unitary
system,
it
found
that
in
its
view
some
of
the
vestiges
had...
had...
had
been
attenuated.
but
yet
it
looked
at
this
black
residential
area,
and
it
could
not
find
that
the
vestiges
there
had
been
attenuated.
we
had,
then,
clearly,
vestiges
of
the
past
that
continue
to
permit,
perpetuate
a
segregated
system
in--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
contrary
to
its
earlier
findings
in
1963
and
1965,
it
said
in
over
25
years
it
found
the
board
hadn't
done
anything
to
perpetuate
this
residential
segregation.
yet,
in
1965
it
found
specifically
that
because
of
state
law
and
board
practices
this
residential
segregation...
segregated
system...
segregated
area
was
created.
so
certainly--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--it
said
it
found
that
the
board
had
not
contributed
to
that
residential
segregation.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
in
this
district,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
it
has.
it
certainly
first
has
countered--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--your
honor,
the
injunction
was
designed
to...
to
require
the
board
to
address
those
practices
that
cause
and
perpetuated
a
residential...
racially
segregated
system.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
that's
all
the
order
at
that
stage
can
do.
it
can
direct
the
board
to
not
create
and
to
not
perpetuate
a
segregated
system.
the
order
may
or
may
not
eventually
eradicate
all
vestiges
of
past
discrimination.
but
until
those
vestiges
are
removed
it's
our
position
that
swift
and
swann
require
that
that
injunction
remain
in
force.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
we
think
the
order
should
remain
and
must
remain
in
force
until
all
vestiges
have
been
eliminated,
which
would
cause
resegregation
even
through
use
of
a
racially
neutral
attendance
plan.
if
there
are--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--well,
yes,
but
it
depends
on
the
extent
to
which
segregation
would
be
reinstated
by
that
residential
segregation.
here
we
have
40
percent
of
the
black
students
in
the
elementary
grades
now
in
segregated
schools,
and
it's
because
of
that
that
we
think
that
the
injunction
should
remain
in
force.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
your
honor--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--why
is
the
injunction
justified?
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
didn't
say
it
had
produced
nothing.
i
said
it
had
certainly
countered
the
residential
segregation
that
the
court
was
trying
to
address.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it's
certainly
useful
in
integrating
the
schools,
and
that's
what
we're
about
in
brown
and
the
cases
that
follow
brown.
the
court
is
talking
about
how
do
we
ensure
that
black
children
are
not
now
going
to
be
relegated
to
a
black
segregated
school,
and
what
the
court
did
in
1972
was
to
direct
a
plan
that
would
remove
barriers
that
prohibited
busing--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--your
honor,
i
think
the
plan
is
designed
to
correct
a
constitutional
violation.
we
have
no
way
of
deciding
how
long
that
plan
has
to
be
in
effect,
and
as
long
as
those
vestiges
are
there
which
permit
resegregation,
if
you
decide
that
we
can't
continue
to
correct
that,
you
tell
us
that
we
can
go
back
to
the
period
before
brown.
that
is
not
what
we
think
is
here.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
if...
well,
i
think
busing
was
envisaged
because
the
court
felt
it
was
necessary
to
use
that
remedy
to
correct
this
intransigent
segregation
of
schools.
and
so
here,
if
there
is
some
other
alternatives...
and
there
may
be.
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
finger
plan
is
the
only
one
that
would
correct
this
past...
for
this
past
discrimination.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
swift
standard
is
applicable
in
school
desegregation
matters
just
like
it's
applicable
generally
in
inequitable
cases.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
think
that
when
the
court,
as
this
court
has
directed,
the
district
court
begins
to
design
a
remedy,
it
takes
into
consideration
that
it's
ordering
a
local
public
school
district
to
do
something.
those
factors
are
taken
into
consideration
at
that
time,
and,
yet,
the
court
knows
that
what
it
is
directing
is
necessary
to
correct
a
constitutional
violation.
now
we
know
of
no
reason
why
we
should
apply
a
lesser
standard
than
in
swift.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes,
sir.
i'm
saying
that,
as
i
think
the
tenth
circuit
pointed
out,
once
you
achieve
the
objectives
of
green
and
swann,
then
the
court...
there's
no
need
for
the
injunction.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
okay.
first,
your
honor,
we
meant
that
the
finger
plan
was
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
integration
of
the
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
it
had
achieved
as
long
as
they
were
operating
with
the
finger
plan.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
we
were--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--there,
we
were
talking
about
unitary
in
the
sense
that
with
that
plan
in
effect,
it
integrated
the
schools
and
removed
the
vestiges
of
the
past
which
would,
though--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--except
for
housing,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
was
unitary
in
a
sense
that
all
vestiges
of
past
discrimination
have
been
eliminated.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
was
using
that
in
the
sense
that
the
plan
was
countering
the...
the
continuing
effects
of
the
past.
not
that
all
vestiges
of
discrimination--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--there
had,
your
honor.
there
had
been
a
number
of
black
families
who
had
moved
out
of
the
residential
area
we
are
complaining
about
to
other
parts
of
the
city.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
but--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--whites
had
been
moving,
had
been
moving
to
areas
in
the
city
and
to
the
suburban
areas--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--we
did.
we
wanted
to
modify
the
finger
plan.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
there
are
two
reasons.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
okay.
first,
under
the
finger
plan
there
was...
the
black
students
were
required
to
be
bused
for
the
first
4
years
and
then
white
children
were
bused
for
1
year.
that
created
an
inequity
in
terms
of
the
burdensharing
of
students
for
desegregation
in
elementary
schools.
second,
the
finger
plan
provided
for
a
stand-alone
school
once
a
neighborhood
became
sort
of
racially
mixed,
and
if
that
was
implemented
it
would
mean
that
the
schools
that
were
becoming
racially
mixed,
which
were
very
near
the
black
residential
area,
would
then
become
stand-alone
schools
so
that
black
children
would
be
bused
further
from
the
central
core
area
to
the
outlying
areas
where
the
schools
were
not
so
mixed.
all
that
was
required
to
accommodate
this
change
was
a
change
in
the
grade
structure
and
the
elimination
of
the
stand-alone
provision.
there
was
no
need
to
abandon
the
plan,
and
that's
why
we
feel
that
the
board
and
the
court,
district
court,
went
too
far
in
modifying--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--no.
we're
talking
about
demographic
movements
that
might
result
in
inequities.
in
a
plan
that
is
directed,
your
honor,
nobody
expects
people
to
remain
static.
we
all
know
that
there
will
be
changes,
and
we
are
not
asking
this
court
or
any
court
to
follow
behind
demographic
changes
in
order
to
try
to
maintain
a
racial
balance.
you've
decided
that
that
is
not
what
should
be
done.
what
we
are
suggesting,
though,
is
that
this
board
not
revert
to
a
plan
that
will
reinstitute
the
discriminatory
practices
of
the
past.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
it
would
not
solve
the
problem.
first
of
all--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--i
think
there
must
be
some
pairing
and
clustering
with
the
schools,
with
transportation
provided
if
that
is
necessary,
in
order
to
accommodate
desegregation
or
the
maintenance
of
desegregation
of
these
elementary
schools.
i
think
as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
look,
we're
talking
not
just
about
the
40
percent
of
the
black
students,
we're
talking
about
14
to
21
white
schools.
so
we
have
a
substantial
number
of
students
in
the
system
now
attending
racially
identifiable
or
racially
segregated
schools.
we
transported
students
under
the
finger
plan.
it
did
create
a
problem.
we
were
able
to
do
it.
so
it
makes
no...
it
creates
no
problem
now
to
accommodate
maintenance
of
integration
in
these
schools.
and
going...
i'd
like
to
address
briefly
the
justification
the
board
offered
for
moving
to
this
plan.
it
said
that
there
were
educational
objectives.
it
said
it
was
going
to
increase
parental
involvement.
it
said
it
was
going
to
increase
community
involvement.
it
said
that
it
was
going
to
institute
an
equity
program
to
improve
the
educational
program,
and
it
had
the
majority-minority
transfer.
your
honor,
neither
of
these
or
all
of
them
collectively
do
not
justify
this
board
resegregating
40
percent
of
its
black
elementary
students.
additionally,
as
the
circuit
court
pointed
out,
there
are
questions
about
the
effectiveness
of
these
programs,
and
all
of
them
can
be
implemented
in
a
desegregated
setting.
we
could
have
the
quality
education
program
in
a
desegregated
setting.
we
could
have
parental
involvement.
we
could
have
community
involvement,
and
we
could
accommodate
all
of
these
objectives
in
maintaining
the
schools,
the
desegregated
schools.
all
of
them,
we
submit,
do
not
justify
resegregating
40
percent
of
the
black
children
in
the
system.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
board
said
that,
and,
your
honor,
in
fact
there
was
a
finding
of
the
district
court
that
that
had
helped
to
promote
parental
involvement.
but--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--well,
justice
kennedy,
the
problem
is
i'm
saying
that
these
things
could
have
been
done;
that
is,
you
could
have
promoted
parental
involvement
with
desegregated
schools.
the
court
didn't
find
that
you
couldn't.
the
court
found
that
it
helped
to
promote,
according
to
the
court,
parental
involvement
by
having
neighborhood
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes.
what--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--well,
i...
you
know,
your
honor,
there
may
be.
i
think
this
court
has
decided
that
de
facto
segregation
will
not
warrant
judicial
intervention,
and
there
are
some
districts,
the
court...
some
lower
courts,
i
don't
recall
this
court...
have
held
were
not
segregated
by
state
action.
so
i...
i--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--your
honor,
it's
clear...
no,
it
should
not.
oklahoma
city
clearly
had
state
law
requiring
segregation
of
students.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
submit
that
there
are
vestiges
of
segregation
still
remaining
in
oklahoma
city
which
bars
the
court
from
considering
oklahoma
like
this
de
facto
situation
we're
talking
about.
second,
your
honor,
in
this
instance
i
submit
that
however
you
define
unitary
you
should
not
permit
oklahoma
city
or
any
other
school
district
like
oklahoma
city
with
this
history
of
de
jure
segregation
to
reinstitute
the
same
assignment
practices
that
caused
segregation
in
the
past.
what
we
have
here
is
not
just
a
system
that
was
segregated
by
state
law
implementing
a
plan
that
eliminated
some
vestiges
and
then
go
on
to
some
other
assignment
system
that
permits
some
racial
identifiability
of
schools.
we
have
a
school
district
that
is
incorporating
its
plan
on
the
same
practices
that
it
used
before
1972
that
caused
segregation,
and
so--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--that's
correct.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
is
not
there,
and
there's
also--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
your
honor,
there
have
been
changes
in
teachers'
assignments.
there
have
been
changes
in
some
racial
mix
of
students
in
other
schools
in
the
system,
but
we
have
gone
back
to
the
same
geographic
zones
that
we
had
before
1972.
we
are
using
the
same
black
residential
area
to
confine
students
in
these
nine
schools
or
10
schools.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
that
is
a
change--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--yeah.
that...
that...
that
is
a
change
in
what
the
law
was
in
1972.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
would
be
some
difference.
but
again,
what
we
have
is
a
plan
that,
as
the
record
now
shows,
perpetuates
black...
black
segregated
schools
in
the
same
schools
we
had
before
1972.
even
with
all
the
changes
that
the
court
has
alluded
to,
we
still
have
nine
black
segregated
schools
in
this
black
residential
area.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
if
the
person
lives
in
the
neighborhood,
then
one
can
go
to
that
school.
it's
just
that
i'm
using
a
different
definition
from
the
court
in
terms
of
segregation,
and
i
think
that
my
definition
is
really
appropriate
because
it
points
out
what
is
really
happening
with
the
practice.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
we...
we'd
point
out
that...
that
first
the
board
didn't
ask
for
a
dissolution
of
the
injunction.
everybody
knew
in
1977
that
that
order
had
to
remain
in
effect
in
order
to
maintain
desegregated
schools.
and
so
when
the
court
entered
the
order
and
dismissed
the
case
no
one
expected
the
board
was
going
to
abandon
that
plan.
we
all
expected
that
this
plan
would
continue,
and
we
knew
it
had
to.
so
we
didn't
have
a
court
really
dismissing.
it
was
only
later
when
the
court
told
us
it
meant
to
dismiss
the
order
when
it
also
said
it
found
a
unitary
system.
but
then
we...
we
have
challenged
that,
and
that
goes
to
the
second
question
you
raise.
we
were
not
bound
by
any
determination
in
'77
if
that
was
supposed
to
be
a
unitary
finding
which
was
supposed
to
dissolve
that
order.
we...
if
we
had...
if
we
were
to
be
bound,
we
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
that
issue.
we
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
litigate
that
issue.
and
so
if
that
is
to
be
the
determination
by
the
court,
we
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
go
demonstrate
it.
and
so
we
contend
that
the
order
was
not
designed
to
eliminate
the
injunction
and--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--we
have
appealed
that,
your
honor.
there
was
a
decision,
a
finding
by
the
court,
and
we
contend
that
finding
was
clearly
erroneous
in
1985
and
1987.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
unitariness
findings.
your
honor,
if
the
court
please,
i
was
in
high
school
when
this
court--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--did
it
address
the
unitary...
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
held
that
the
court,
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--yes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i'm
sorry?
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
court--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--the
court
said--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--the
court
said
basically
two
things,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
could
furnish
it
later.
i
just
wanted
to
respond
to
justice
white.
the
court
said
basically
two
things.
one,
that
the
basis
the
district
court
used
for
making
its
finding
were
clearly
erroneous.
the
court
had
found
that
the
discrimination
had
attenuated
and
that
it
was
no
longer
a
basis
for
this...
the
imposition
of
the
injunctive
order.
the
court
also
found
that
the
court...
the
district
court
had
relied
on
intent,
and
the
district
court
said
that
was
not
a
determining
factor.
so--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--thank
you,
your
honor.
