what
did
you
mean...
i...
what
did
you
mean
by
your
statement
in
your
brief
that...
it
says,
"here,
it
was
petitioner's
school
board
that
unilaterally
without
notice
or
permission
abandoned
part
of
a
school
plan
that
had
effectively
and
permanently
achieved
full
integration?
"
and
there's
another
statement,
"here,
the
school
board
itself
acted
unilaterally
to
reverse
the
pupil
assignment
plan
that
had
made
the
system
unitary.
"
now,
what
did
you
mean
by
those
statements?
justice
white
well,
you
say
that
it
had
achieved.
justice
white
well,
obviously
it
had
effectively
and
permanently
achieved
full
integration
and
that
it
had
made
the
system
unitary.
justice
white
what
did
you
mean
by
unitary?
justice
white
so
you
say--
justice
white
--you
do...
you
do
agree,
then,
that
the
plan
had
made
the
system
unitary
but
that
you
just
can't
abandon
it
if
it
means
going
back
to
black
schools?
justice
white
well,
you
said
it
was
unitary.
justice
white
by
the
way,
what...
what
had
happened
during
the
life
of
the
finger
plan
residentially?
had
there
been
a
lot
of
demographic
movement
in
the
city?
justice
white
and--
justice
white
--and
had
whites
been
moving,
also?
justice
white
well,
did
you
feel
at
the
time
that
in
1988,
1987-1988,
do
you
think
that
the
finger
plan
was
still
an
effective
instrument
to
achieve
your
end?
i
thought
you
wanted
it
changed
yourself?
justice
white
why
did...
why
did
you
want
it
modified?
justice
white
what
had
happened?
justice
white
so
basically,
you
think
that
the
district
court
in
a
situation
like
that
should
modify
its
desegregation
plan
in
order
to
keep
up
with
demographic
movements
that
might
result
in
blacker
schools
or
whiter
schools?
justice
white
well,
not
really.
they...
it's
not
against
the
law
for
blacks
and
whites
to
go
to
school
together
anymore
in
oklahoma
city.
justice
white
well,
that
was
the
practice
before,
and
that
isn't
there
anymore.
justice
white
well,
there
a
lot
of
other--
justice
white
--you
say
that
they're
still
back
to
their...
up
to
their
same
old
tricks.
well,
that
isn't
really
so,
is
it?
justice
white
what
about
in
'85
and
'87?
justice
white
what
finding?
you
mean--
justice
white
--what
do
you
think?
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
the
unitary
issue?
justice
white
what
did
it
hold?
justice
white
on
the
unitary...
on
the
unitariness?
justice
white
well,
i
find
it
very
fuzzy
in
that
respect.
justice
white
i...
i
find
it
very
fuzzy
in
that
respect
because
i
thought
they
really
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
unitary
or
not;
the
injunction
remains.
justice
white
that's
what
it
held.
justice
white
they
applied
swift
and
said
that
unitariness
just
was
irrelevant
to
their
decision.
