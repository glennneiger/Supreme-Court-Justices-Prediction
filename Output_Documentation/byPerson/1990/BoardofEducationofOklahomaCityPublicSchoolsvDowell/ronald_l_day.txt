mr.
ronald
l.
day
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
formerly
de
jure
school
system
which
eliminated
unlawful
discrimination
through
sustained
good
faith
compliance
with
the
compulsory
desegregation
decree
and
then
8
years
subsequent
to
the
achievement
of
unitary
status
was
persuaded
by
intervening
demographic
forces
and
legitimate
educational
considerations
to
curtail
compulsory
busing
in
grades
1
through
4
only
and
reassign
those
pupils
to
their
neighborhood
schools.
because
there
are
neighborhoods
in
oklahoma
city
which
are
not
integrated,
11
of
64
elementary
schools
at
that
time
became
predominantly
black.
the
respondents
challenged
the
racial
disproportionate
impact
of
the
plan,
and
this
chapter
of
the
litigation
was
opened.
this
case
presents
what
is
perhaps
the
most
important
unresolved
question
in
the
area
of
desegregation;
that
is,
what
is
the
effect
of
a
binding
declaration
that
a
formerly
de
jure
school
system
has
achieved
unitary
status.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
i
define
unitary
status,
justice
blackmun,
as
the
court
did,
the
unanimous
court
in
swann
and
spangler;
that
is,
it's
a
school
district
that
has
dismantled
the
dual
school
system
and
eliminated
unlawful
discrimination,
including
the
vestiges
of
unlawful
discrimination,
to
the
extent
practical.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
no
question
about
it,
because
the
'77
record
demonstrates,
justice
blackmun,
that
respondents'
attorney
or
plaintiffs'
attorney
took
the
position
at
that
time
that
jurisdiction
could
not
be
relinquished
until
all
the
vestiges
of
discrimination
had
been
eliminated,
and
of
course,
the
district
court
did
relinquish
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
i
believe
in
1977
judge
bohanon
did
comment
that
he
did
not
foresee
that
his
order
would
result
in
the
dismantlement
of
the
plan.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
an
order
which
had
the
effect
of
compelling
the
board
to
continue
to
follow
the
plan.
for
example--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--no.
no,
justice
o'connor.
although
a...
the
implementation
of
a
plan
will
create
a
race-neutral
method
of
student
assignment,
green
clearly
indicates
that
there
must
be
a
period
of
good
faith
and
sustained
compliance,
and
i
do
believe
that's
necessary.
in
oklahoma
city
we
had
13
years
of
that.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
yes.
it
is
our
position
that
the
finding
of
unitarian--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
no,
i
believe
that's
incorrect,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
the
unitary
finding
represents
that
the
dual
school
system
has
been
dismantled
and
that
the
vestiges
of
elimination
have
been
eliminated.
i
would
point
out
that
in
1985
judge
bohanon
expressed
no
surprise
when
the
board
did
change
the
plan,
and
that
his
intent
is
reflected
through
that
order.
i
would
also
point
out
that
when
this
case
was
filed
in
1961
we
had
a
true
dual
system,
and
all
six
of
the
green
factors
were
discriminatory
in
oklahoma
city.
presently,
the
only
similarity
is
the
composition
of
the
student
body,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
the
constitution
does
not
guarantee
any
particular
degree
of
racial
balance
or
mixing.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
yes,
it
does.
in--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--yes,
it
is.
in
keys
the
court
stated
that
the
attitudes
of
administrators
and
members
of
the
community
are
relevant
in
determining
if
segregation
has
been
eliminated,
so
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
it
is
our
position
that
they
were
not.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
that
that
was
his
intent,
yes,
justice
stevens.
we--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--yes,
that
would
be
correct.
however,
i
would
hasten
to
point
out
that
on
an
evidentiary
hearing,
there
could
be
circumstances
where
that
decree
could
be
modified--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
well,
we
do
not
believe
it
was.
first,
i
believe
that
language
was
intended
to
apply
to
the
board
during
the
remedial
phase
of
the
case
when
unitary
status
was
being
achieved.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
that's
correct.
may
i
also
state
that
our
position
is
based
on
the
rationale
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
riddick
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
overton.
in
each
of
those
cases,
unitary
status,
coupled
with
court
disengagement,
was
found
sufficient
to
return
total
control
to
the
board,
and
in
neither
of
those
cases
did
the
district
court
dissolve
the
decree.
those
jurisdictions
believed
that
the
achievement
of
unitary
status
coupled
with
court
disengagement
has
the
effect
of
rendering
the
decree
inoperable,
and
that
is
the...
that
is
the
understanding
of
the
oklahoma
city
board
when
they
implemented
this
plan.
it
was
also
the
understanding
of
judge
bohanon
at
that
time.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
i
don't
believe
he
thought
it
was
necessary.
in
a
subsequent
opinion,
he
did
state
that
in
both
1985
and
1987
that
when
he
found
the
district
unitary
in
1977
he
certainly
intended
to
return
full
control
to
the
board
of
education
at
that
time.
there
was
no
question
about
that,
and
he
certainly
intended
to
say
that
this
district
was,
indeed,
a
true
unitary
district
which
had
dismantled
the
dual
system
and
eliminated
the
vestiges
of
discrimination.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
no.
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
is
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
neighborhoods
that
are
not
integrated,
does
that
mean
the
finger
plan
didn't
work?
mr.
ronald
l.
day
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
fact
that
certain
neighborhoods
in
oklahoma
city
are
not
integrated
is
as
a
result
of
a
phenomenon
over
which
this
board
of
education,
and
no
board
of
education,
has
control.
we're
speaking
of
a
condition
of
residential
segregation.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
what
judge
bohanon
did
find
was
that
when
the
neighborhood
school
policy
was
superimposed
over
nonintegrated
neighborhoods,
coupled
with
the
illegal
minority-to-majority
transfer
policy,
that
this
had
the
effect
in
some
cases
of
creating
schools
which
were
segregated,
not
neighborhoods.
in
fact,
judge
bohanon,
in
1970,
in
an
opinion,
clearly
stated
that
the
oklahoma
city
board
of
education
had
done
nothing
to
cause
or
contribute
to
residential
segregation
in
oklahoma
city.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
perhaps
the
most
important
unresolved
question
in
the
area
of
desegregation
law.
that
is,
what
is
the
effect
of
a
binding
declaration
that
a
formerly
de
jure
school
system
has
achieved
unitary
status?
according
to
respondents,
it
means
very
little,
if
anything,
for
in
their
view
a
unitary
school
district
is
obligated
to
continue
to
labor
under
the
governance
of
a
desegregation
decree
and
maintain
racial
balance
until
all
the
neighborhoods
in
a
community
are
unitary.
based
on
fundamental
principles
previously
announced
by
this
court
in
the
desegregation
context,
we
believe
that
unitarianist
must
mean
that
the
constitutional
violation
has
been
eliminated,
and
therefore
control
over
the
schools
should
be
returned
to
the
board
of
education.
we
believe
that
it
means
the
desegregation
decree
should
be
lifted,
and
at
that
time
the
school
board
should
be
returned
to
the
same
status
as
any
other
school
board,
thereby
being
governed
by
traditional
equal
protection
principles.
now,
the
unitarianist
finding
in
oklahoma
city
came
16
years
after
this
suit
was
filed.
although
the
case
was
filed
in
1961,
and
the
school
board
first
used
busing
as
an
aid
to
integration
in
1965,
it
was
not
until
1
year
after
swann
that
a
comprehensive
plan
was
implemented.
in
1972,
judge
bohanon
ordered
the
school
board
to
implement
the
finger
plan,
which
employed
the
techniques
of
pairing,
clustering,
and
massive
cross-town
busing
to
integrate
all
the
schools
in
oklahoma
city.
the
board
of
education
appealed
that
order,
and
the
circuit
affirmed.
thus,
under
the
rationale
of
spangler,
it
became
the
law
of
this
case
that
the
finger
plan
constituted
a
race-neutral
and
constitutional
method
of
pupil
assignment.
in
1977,
judge
bohanon,
pursuant
to
a
motion
by
the
board,
entered
his
order
terminating
the
case.
that
order
did
find
that
the
school
district
had
achieved
unitariness
after
16
years
and
terminated
all
further
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
justice
stevens,
you're
exactly
correct.
he
did
find
that
during
the
1960's
he
was
dealing
with
a
recalcitrant
board.
that's
not
to
say,
however,
that
the
board
did
not
make
some
accomplishments
towards
dismantling
the
dual
system.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
that's
right,
but
the
prior
opinions
in
the
case
demonstrate
that,
for
example,
there
was
integration
in
sporting
activities,
extracurricular
activities.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
in
other
words,
that
some
of
the
green
factors
were
being
impacted
prior
to
'72.
but
i
would
agree
with
you
that
it
wasn't
until
1972
that
a
comprehensive
plan
was
implemented
to
dismantle
the
dual
system.
after
the
school
board
was
found
unitary
in
1977,
it
elected
to
voluntarily
continue
to
follow
the
plan,
and
it
did
that
for
8
more
years
until
a
committee
study
revealed
that
demographic
changes
had
rendered
the
plan
inequitable
at
the
elementary
level.
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
board
decided
to
implement
the
neighborhood
school
plan
for
grades
1
through
4
only.
it
does,
to
this
day,
continue
to
bus
students
in
grades
5
through
12.
judge
bohanon,
who
by
the
way
has
lived
with
this
case
since
its
inception,
found
that
this
plan
was
adopted
by
the
board
for
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
purposes.
first,
to
reduce
the
busing
burdens
on
young
black
children
on
oklahoma
city.
second,
to
stop
the
threat
of
school
closures
in
the
black
community.
third,
to
increase
the
level
of
parental
and
community
involvement
in
the
public
schools,
which
had
been
lacking.
and
finally,
to
give
these
youngsters
more
time
to
participate
in
extracurricular
activities.
now,
judge
bohanon
acknowledged
that
in
the
1960's,
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
stevens,
this
board
was
recalcitrant,
and
he
butted
heads
with
the
board.
but
in
his
recent
decisions
he
has
clearly
pointed
out
that
the
present
board
of
education,
and
the
board
that
was
in
power
when
his
plan
was
implemented,
was
a
totally
different
board
with
totally
different
attitudes.
his
findings
must
be
given
due
deference.
he's
lived
with
this
case
since
1961.
he
is
most
familiar
with
the
on-the-spot
conditions
in
this
case,
and
his
findings,
on
this
record,
must
be
given
due
consideration.
i
would
also
point
out
that
judge
bohanon
noted
that
in
oklahoma
city
the
manner
in
which
pupils
are
assigned
to
schools
is
no
longer
determined
by
race.
rather,
it's
determined
on
the
race-neutral
method
of
where
the
children
live,
and
judge
bohanon
felt
that
it
was
very
important
that
this
school
board
had
implemented
a
transfer
policy...
it's
called
a
majority-to-minority
transfer
policy...
which
allowed
any
student
in
a
school
which
was
racially
identifiable
to
transfer
to
a
school
which
was
more
integrated,
and
the
school
district
picks
up
the
cost
of
transportation
in
those
circumstances.
so
today,
in
oklahoma
city,
no
child
is
compelled
to
attend
school
by
virtue
of
race,
and
the
important
thing
today
is
that
parents
of
all
races
have
a
choice.
judge
bohanon
also
found
that
the
school
board
had
maintained
its
unitary
status
from
1977
to
date.
in
this
case,
we
had
three
findings
of
unitariness:
one
in
1977,
one
in
1985,
and
another
in
1987,
all
made
by
judge
bohanon
based
on
the
circumstances
in
oklahoma
city.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
yes.
to
the--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--it
is
our
position,
justice
scalia,
that
once
unitary
status
is
achieved,
it
signifies
that
unlawful
discrimination
has
been
eliminated
and
the
vestiges
have
been
eliminated
to
the
extent
practical.
that
was
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
alexander
case.
we
also
believe
that,
since
the
remedy
must
be
related
to
the
constitutional
violation,
that
a
district
court
is
obligated
in
the
first
instance,
when
it
formulates
the
decree,
to
identify
the
vestiges
so
they
may
be
eradicated.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
the
question
was
how
was
the
board
injured?
justice
marshall,
we
don't...
we
believe
that
if
this
plan
remained
in
effect--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--with
all
due
respect,
justice
marshall,
they
do
intend
and
do
comply
with
the
constitution.
they
made
this
change,
and
i
think
this
is
a
very--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--well,
they
weren't
harmed
so
much,
but
the
young
black
students
were.
you
see--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--yes.
they
made
this--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--the
young
black
children?
mr.
ronald
l.
day
yes,
sir,
they
are.
they
are
the
plaintiffs
and
respondents.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
no,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
they
believe
that
because
in
1977
there
were
increased
busing
burdens
on
young
minority
children,
that
a
change
was
necessary.
they
would
still
be
busing
in
grades
1
through
4
today
if
that
plan
had
not
become
oppressive
at
that
level.
all
parties
in
this--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--you
have
the
assurance
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
traditional--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--traditional--
mr.
ronald
l.
day
--well,
when
they
achieve
unitary
status,
they
are
governed
by
traditional
equal
protection
principles.
in
other
words,
they
may
not
take
any
action
which
is
taken
with
intent
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
if
they
do,
the
fourteenth
amendment
authorizes
federal
courts
to
again
receive
jurisdiction
and
remedy
that
violation.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court,
we're
prepared
to
yield
the
remainder
of
our
time
back
to
the
court.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
justice
kennedy,
the
respondents
had
alternative
arguments,
and
i
believe
in
their
first
argument
there
was
no
definition,
but
in
one
of
their
alternative
arguments
they
took
the
position
that
before
a
unitary
status
can
be
achieved
that
all
the
vestiges
had
to
be
eliminated,
and
in
oklahoma
city
that
meant
that
all
the
neighborhoods
had
to
be
integrated.
mr.
ronald
l.
day
yes.
