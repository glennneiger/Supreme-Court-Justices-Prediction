justice
scalia
mr.
day,
do
you
understand
that
unitarianist
means
both
that
there
no
continuing
discrimination
and
that
the
vestiges
of
past
discrimination
have
been
eliminated?
justice
scalia
or
is
it
rather
that
unitarianist
means
you
are
now
running
a
system
in
which
there
is
no
discrimination,
but
there
may
or
may
not
be
the
vestiges
of
past
discrimination?
justice
scalia
of
course,
it's
still
doing
that
here,
isn't
it?
one
of
the...
one
of
the
remedies
that
the
school
board
has
continued
to
apply
is
the
majority
transfer
program.
that
is
to
say,
if
you
happen
to
be
of
the
race
that
is
in
the
majority
in
a
particular
school,
you
can
transfer
to
a
school
in
which
your
race
is
not
in
the
majority.
justice
scalia
is
that...
is
that
unlawful,
in
your
view?
justice
scalia
well,
then
what
you
just
said
is
wrong.
justice
scalia
in
saying
that
that's
the
issue,
you're
using
the
word
segregate
in
an
unusual
sense.
it
is
the
fact,
isn't
it,
that
any
of
the
black
children
who
are
in
those
neighborhood
schools
can
choose
to
go
to
different
schools
if
they
wish?
justice
scalia
of
course,
the
main
reason
it
might
not
solve
the
problem
is
that
the
parents
would
rather
have
their
children
go
to
the
neighborhood
school--
justice
scalia
--which
they
participate
in,
and
which
they
can
watch
and
which
they
can
have
some
voice
in
running.
justice
scalia
once
again,
you're
using
segregated
to
mean
the
schools
that...
that
happen
to
have
a
majority
or
almost
a
totality
of
one
race
but
in
which
anyone
who
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
any
race
can
go,
and
you
call
that
a
segregated
school.
justice
scalia
well,
is
it
a
segregated
community?
can
anybody
move
into
that
community
or
move
out
of
that
community?
justice
scalia
well,
that
does
not
mean
that
it's...
i
thought
segregated
meant
that...
you
know,
segregated
means
you
couldn't
move
there
unless
you
were...
unless
you
were
white.
justice
scalia
you
couldn't
use
that
room
unless
you
were
white.
that's
segregation.
justice
scalia
and
that's...
and
that's
res
judicata.
you
didn't
appeal
that.
justice
scalia
what
do
you...
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
point
that
if...
if
a
quarter
century
of
busing
hasn't...
hasn't
made
a
dent
in
that,
what
reason
is
there
to
believe
that
the
next
quarter
century
is...
is...
is
going
to
make
a
dent
in
it?
justice
scalia
and
if
there's
no
reason
to
believe,
why
is
it
justifiable
as
a...
as
a...
as
an
injunction
from
the
court?
justice
scalia
yeah.
i
mean,
you
know,
you
don't
direct
them
to
do
things
that
are
useless,
and
if,
as
you
tell
us,
25
years
has
produced
nothing--
justice
scalia
--while
it's
in
effect,
but
as
soon
as
it's
gone
you
say
the
vestige
returns.
it
hasn't
been
eliminated.
justice
scalia
well,
then
it
is
not
useful
in
eliminating
the
vestige.
justice
scalia
you
do
not
regard
this,
then,
as
a
transitional
remedy,
which
is
what
it
was
originally
described
at
when
it
was
adopted.
you...
you
envision
it
as
a
permanent
remedy,
that
it...
it
eliminates
the
vestige
as
long
as
it
is
in
effect;
and
once
it's
taken
away,
the
vestige
comes
back.
therefore,
you
say
it's
a
permanent...
a
permanent
remedy.
justice
scalia
or
adopt
other
remedies
that...
that
won't
require
perpetual
supervision
of
democratic
processes
by
courts.
that's
not
how
busing
was
originally
envisioned.
justice
scalia
just
continue
to
note
my
objection
to
the
use
of
the
word
segregated
in
that
context.
there...
there
are
schools
that
do
not
have
integrated
student
populations
in
the
sense
of
being
the
mixed
races,
but
they
are
not
segregated
as
i
understand
the
word
segregated.
you
acknowledge
that
anybody
of
any
race
can
go
to
those
schools
if
he's
in
the
neighborhood.
