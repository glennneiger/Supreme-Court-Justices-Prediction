justice
o'connor
mr.
day,
did
the
district
court
in
1977
assume
that
the
plan
would
remain
in
effect
in
making
its
unitariness
binding?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
a
school
district
reaches
that
unitary
status
as
soon
as
the
desegregation
plan
is
in
effect?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
in
1978,
for
example,
in
this
case
that
the
school
distinct
would
have
been
free
to
reintroduce
neighborhood
schools?
justice
o'connor
as
of
that
time?
justice
o'connor
and
the
result
apparently
would
be
to,
in
many
of
the
schools,
return
it
to
the
conditions
that
existed
when
the
lawsuit
began
so
many
years
ago;
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
general
starr,
how
does
a
school
district
eliminate
the
last
vestiges
of
discrimination
when
residential
segregation
remains
a
reality
and
when
at
some
point
in
the
past
the
segregated
schools
may
have
contributed
to
that
residential
segregation?
how
do
you
deal
with
that?
it
seems
to
me
that
may
be
the
crux
of
the
problem.
justice
o'connor
didn't
the
district
court
make
a
finding,
though,
on
whether
the
school
district
was
responsible
for
the
residential
segregation?
justice
o'connor
what
was
its
later
finding?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
100
years
from
now
in
oklahoma
city
there
are
still
some
residential
patterns
that
have...
show
predominantly
black
neighborhoods
and
predominantly
white
neighborhoods,
does
this
order
have
to
remain
in
effect
all
that
time
and
on
into
the
next
centuries?
justice
o'connor
xxx.
justice
o'connor
mr.
chambers,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
view
if
the
transfer
provisions
were
fully
adequate
so
that
any
pupil
wanting
to
get
out
of
a
school
could
do
so?
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
o'connor
in
other
words,
you
think
there
must
be
forced
busing
for
students
who
do
not
want
to
be
bused?
justice
o'connor
and
also
the
transfer
policy,
so
that
any
student
in
a
racially
segregated
residential
area
can
transfer
out
on
request.
that
also
would
be
some
difference.
