justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lajeunesse,
i'm
not
sure
that
abood
drew
a
so-called
bright-line
test
for
public
sector
employees.
the
argument
made
on
the
other
side
is
that
multi-unit
unions
effectively
strengthen
the
local
bargaining
unit
and
that
it's
just
like
buying
an
insurance
policy
and
spreading
the
risk
that
those
expenses
outside
the
bargaining
unit
can
strengthen
the
local
unit
as
the
need
occurs
locally.
how
do
you
answer
that?
justice
o'connor,
two
answers.
first,
the
argument
that
the
local
is
strengthened
by
the
activities
elsewhere
is
the
same
argument
the
railway
clerks'
union
made
in
the
ellis
case
for
organizing...
compelling
support
of
organizing
and
compelling
support
of
litigation
concerning
bargaining...
other
bargaining
units,
and
the
court
rejected
it
in
ellis.
the
court
established
a
standard
which
says
that
what
is
chargeable
is
only
those
activities
that
are
part
of
the
performance
of
the
statutory
functions
of
representing
the
employees,
in
dealing
with
the
employer
on
labor
management
issues.
or
germane...
not
part
of.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
part
of,
does
it?
justice
o'connor
if
there
were--
justice
o'connor
--would
it
make
a
difference?
justice
o'connor
going
back
to
lobbying
for
a
minute,
i
suppose
in
the
public
sector
if
the
union
is
out
lobbying
to
try
to
get
increased
health
benefits,
for
example,
for
public
employees
including
those
in
the
bargaining
unit
or
a
tax
increase
to
fund
payment
of
teachers'
salaries
statewide
that
would
affect
those
in
the
bargaining
unit
as
well.
now
you
say
none
of
that
is
chargeable?
justice
o'connor
and
why
not?
justice
o'connor
mr.
chanin,
in
the
ellis
case
this
court
held,
with
most
justices
joining
the
opinion
as
i
recall,
that
objectors
could
not
be
charged
for
the
costs
of
general
litigation
unless
the
local
bargaining
unit
was
directly
involved.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
would
lead
one
to
conclude
that
that
case
was
wrongly
decided.
justice
o'connor
but
i'm
really
in
doubt
whether
that
rationale
can
be
squared
with
ellis
on
the
so-called
statutory
ground.
it
seems
to
me
to
go
substantially
beyond
what
the
court
said
there.
