chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-1217,
jones
lehnert
v.
ferris
faculty.
let's
try
to
move
along,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
lajeunesse,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
it
had
to
be
a
political
or
ideological
activity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so,
you
define
any
political
and
ideological
as
meaning
any
activity
that
does
not
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
bargaining
unit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
this
was
just
a
study
out
in
arizona?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
your
argument
would
be,
not
that
that
was
political
or
ideological,
but
since
it
didn't
benefit
the
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
it
was
no
good.
i
would
think
there's
a
category
of
things--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
if,
if
one
sets
out
to
do
a
neutral
study
that
just
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
what
the
person
is
at,
i
would
not
think
that's
political
or
ideological.
i
think
it's
more
better
defined
as
something
that
is,
is
not
perhaps
germane
to
the
bargaining
process.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr....
mr.
lajeunesse,
what
if
there
were
pending
in
the
michigan
legislature
a
bill
that
would
have
directed
the
10-percent
reduction
in
the
appropriation
for
all
colleges
like
ferris
state
college?
do
you
think
the
bargaining
unit,
the
respondent
here,
could
charge
to
the
agency
shop
people
the...
whatever
costs
they
spent
in
lobbying
against
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lajeunesse.
mr.
chanin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
was
construed
to
rla
ever
since
hanson
very
much
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
provisions,
have
we
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
that
different,
mr.
chanin,
from
say
a
proposition
on
a
ballot
or
a
millage,
a
millage
vote?
is
that
any
less
free
expression
voting
for
a
candidate
than
voting
for
an
electoral
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
test
is
it's
germane.
i
mean,
that
really
does
not
give
a
lot
of
answers.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
well,
let's
get
to
some
of
the
precise
questions
we
have
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
lobbying
on
the
millage
elections?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
yeah,
but
it's
apparently
stipulated
that
millage
has
no
direct
effect
on
what
happens
to
the
budget
of
the
ferris
college.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
they're
germane
to
the
parent
union.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
the
parent
union
do
collective
bargaining
or
does
it
just
support
local
unions
which
do
collective--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--so
the
michigan
education
association
doesn't
itself
do
any
collective
bargaining?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr....
you're--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
millage...
the
millage
doesn't
produce
any
funding
for
ferris.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
what
you're
arguing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
some--
--because
some
say
ferris'
turn
will
come.
they'll...
they'll
have
a
millage
election.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chanin.
mr.
lajeunesse,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
he
suggested
that
it
was
by
custom
if
not
by
law.
would
that
make
any
difference
if
it
were
shown
by
custom
they
did
all
these
things
even
though
perhaps
they
could
not
have
been
compelled
to
in
a
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lajeunesse.
the
case
is
submitted.
