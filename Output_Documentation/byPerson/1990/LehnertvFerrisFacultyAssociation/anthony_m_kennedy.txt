justice

could,
could
a
union
publish
in
its
own
publication
the
voting
record
of,
say,
the
school
board
or
state
legislators
with
respect
to
issues
that
affect
the
bargaining
unit?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
mean
with
the
fees
of
the
dissenters?
justice
kennedy
was
there
any
finding
one
way
or
the
other
on
whether
they
discussed
informational
picketing,
which
i
take
it
is
not
unlawful,
i
would
assume.
justice
kennedy
was
this
part
of
the
union
hall
meeting?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
there's
informational
picketing
at
the
headquarters
of
the
school
board,
is
that...
in
front
of
the
building.
it's
obviously
directed
both
ways,
isn't
it?
you
don't
just
pick
up
the
board
members
by
going
to
their
house,
tell
the
public
what
your
concern
is
with
board
members'
policy.
that's
not
permissible
in
your
view...
with
the
public
union?
justice
kennedy
so
the
further
away--
justice
kennedy
--counsel,
the
further
away
the
bargaining
units
gets
from
the
employee,
the
less
the
first
amendment
protection
the
employee
has.
justice
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
it
should
be
the
other
way
around.
