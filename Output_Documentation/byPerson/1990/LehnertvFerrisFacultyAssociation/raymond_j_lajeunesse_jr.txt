mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
professor
jim
lehnert
and
his
fellow
petitioners
in
1981-82
were
nonunion
faculty
members
at
ferris
state
college,
a
4-year
institution
of
higher
education
in
the
state
of
michigan.
they
were
compelled
by
the
college
to
pay
as
a
condition
of
their
employment
a
service
fee
to
their
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
the
ferris
faculty
association.
the
lower
courts,
with
justice
merritt
of
the
court
of
appeals
vigorously
dissenting
as
to
all
but
one
activity,
held
that
professor
lehnert
and
his
colleagues'
first
amendment
rights
were
not
violated
when
those
service
fees
were
used
for
certain
activities
of
the
association
and
at
state
and
national
affiliates,
the
michigan
and
national
education
associations.
two
basic
questions
are
before
the
court.
first,
may
professor
lehnert
and
his
colleagues
be
required
to
subsidize
financially
activities
which
are
not
conducted
on
behalf
of
their
bargaining
unit
but
on
behalf
of
individuals
elsewhere
in
other
bargaining
units
in
michigan
and
in
other
states,
on
behalf
of
employees
who
are
not
faculty
members
in
higher
education
but
teachers
in
kindergarten
through
12th
grade,
educational
support
personnel,
or
nurses.
the
second
major
issue
is
whether
professor
lehnert
and
his
nonunion
colleagues
can
be
required
to
support
financially
political
and
ideological
activities
that
are
not
part
of
the
bargaining
process
anywhere.
what
activities
are
we
talking
about?
most
of
the
activities
at
issue
on
this
appeal
both
do
not
concern
the
ferris
bargaining
unit
and
are
not
integral
to
the
bargaining
process
anywhere.
for
example,
two
of
the
primary
expenditures
at
issue
are
the
costs
of
millage
campaigns
to
increase
millage
property
taxes
and
lobbying
against
state
legislation
that
would
have
provided
property
tax
relief.
ferris
state
college
receives
not
one
cent
from
millages
or
from
property
taxes,
so
therefore,
ferris
state
college
was
not
affected
by
these
activities
at
all.
the
only
effect
on
professor
lehnert
and
his
colleagues
was
as
competitors
for
scarce
public
resources,
and
if
they
lived
in
the
district
where
the
taxes
were
raised,
their
taxes
went
up.
they're
affected
as
taxpayers.
another
example
of
an
issue
or
an
activity
in
this
category
was
the
study
that
the
national
education
association
conducted
of
school
finance
in
arizona.
that
had
to
be
a
political
and
ideological
activity
and
it
wasn't
related
to
ferris
state
college
because
arizona
did
not
even
permit
collective
bargaining
for
educational
employees
at
the
time
in
question.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
could
not
be
part
of
the
political
bargaining
process
in
arizona,
because
bargaining
was
prohibited
by
the
state
of
arizona
for
educational
employees.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
political
and
ideological
is
any
public
advocacy
or
dealing
with
government
outside
the
bargaining
process,
petitioning
of
government
speech
and
association.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
was
a
study
of
school
finance,
and
school
finance
in
arizona
was
accomplished
only
through
legislation,
not
through
bargaining.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
it's
both.
it
neither
concerned
this
bargaining
unit
nor
was
it
part
of
the
bargaining
process
anywhere.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
related
to
the
question
of
taxes
and
educational
appropriations
in
the
state
of
arizona
as
well
as
being
outside
the
bargaining
unit
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
impermissible,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it's
outside
the
bargaining
process.
it's
an
activity
which
is
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment
as
equally
as
the
support
of
candidates
for
public
office,
as
this
court
said
in
meyer
v.
grant.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
there's
a
bright-line
test--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
bright-line
test.
there
are
two
standards
which
this
court
has
consistently
applied
and
which
in
fact
are
the...
based
on
a
statute,
and
that
is
if
an
activity
is
either
outside
the
bargaining
process
or
does
not
concern
the
bargaining
unit
then
it's
not
within
the
governmental
interest
that
this
court
has
found
to
underlie
a
constitutional
agency
shop.
the
governmental
interest
which
this
court
found
to
underlie
a
constitutional
agency
shop
in
abood,
which
involved
the
same
statute
that's
at
issue
here,
are
the
same
interests
that
the
court
has
found
with
regard
to
the
federal
labor
statutes
in
the
cases
from
hanson
through
beck
and
that
is
to
advance
labor
peace
within
the
bargaining
units
by
having
one
bargaining
agent
to
make...
make
and
enforce
a
single
contract
for
the
employees
in
that
unit
to
prevent
the
conflict
which
would
arise
if
you
had
more
than
one
representative
trying
to
represent
the
employees
in
the
same
unit.
and
secondly
to
avoid
the
risk
of
the
free
rider,
the
employee
who
doesn't
join
the
union
and
is
not
paying
his
pro
rata
share
of
the
costs
of
the
statutory
functions
which
the
union
as
bargaining
representative
performs
for
the
employees
in
that
bargaining
unit
in
making
and
enforcing
the
labor
contract.
so
both
of
those
interests
come
back
to
that
dual
bright-line
test.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
germane...
the
definition
of
germane
under
both
law
and--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--germane
is
closely
related,
justice
white.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
germane
and
closely
related,
your
honor.
and
the
second
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
is
that
affiliation
is
not
an
insurance
policy.
it's
not
a
service
contract.
there
is
no
legally
enforceable
contract
between
the
local
and
the
state
and
national
organizations
which
specifies
as
service
contracts
do
and
as
insurance
policies
do
what
services
will
be
provided,
what
specific
services
will
be
provided.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
the
contingencies--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--if...
if
you
had
a
legally
enforceable
contract
spelling
out
the
bargaining
services
that
had
to
be
provided
and
when
they
had
to
be
provided,
and
you
had
the
allocation
necessary
to
separate...
and
this
is
the
second
distinction
between
the
service
contract
and
affiliation...
if
you
had
the
necessary
recordkeeping
to
separate
out
the
nonbargaining
functions
of
the
union,
then
the
answer
might
be
that
the
costs
would
be
chargeable.
but
it
would
be
costs
that
the
union
approved,
actual
costs
that
there
was
a
basis
in
actual
costs
for
the
charge.
but
this
court
has
said
in
the
cases
beginning
with
street
not
that
affiliation
itself
is
a
cost
of
collective
bargaining
that
can
be
charged,
but
that
there
must
be
a
breakdown
of
the
services
provided
by
the
state
or
national
affiliate
that
can
be
charged
to
the
nonmembers.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
don't--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i...
because,
number
one,
we're
dealing
with
an
activity
which
the
state
has
excluded
from
the
special
bargaining
process
and
has
left
in
the
normal
political
processes.
it's
a
matter
of
subject
to
decision
of
the
state
legislature.
in
the
case
of
millages,
the
electorate
at
large.
so
the
state
has
decided
that
it's
not
within
that
special
process
of
collective
bargaining
and
therefore
as
to
that
process,
the
employee
must
be
treated
not
as
an
employee
but
a
citizen,
a
taxpayer,
a
consumer,
a
competitor
for
scarce
public
resources,
and
in
the
case
of
some
of
these
matters,
as
a
parent.
that's
how
he's
affected.
the
in...
when
you
get
outside
that
narrow,
special
process
which
the
state
has
set
up
for
collective
bargaining,
you're
infringing
on
core
first
amendment
rights,
which
this
court
has
said
are
the
same
as
the
rights
that
exist
with
regard
to
the
support
of
candidates.
if...
if
you
don't
draw
the
line
at
the
process,
what
are
the
limits?
the
same
thing
could
be
said
with
regard
to
a
private
sector
labor
union
that
when
it
lobbies
congress
for
minimum
wage
legislation,
that
could
be
chargeable.
but
this
court
has
said
in
street
and
in
ellis
and
in
beck
that
can't
be
charged
in
the
private
sector,
and
the
court
has
said
in
abood
and
in
keller
that
the
first
amendment
rights
of
public
employees
and
private
employees
are
the
same.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
place
you
can
draw
the
line
except
at
the
process
because
it's
a
slippery
slope.
if
lobbying
is
chargeable,
why
shouldn't
support
of
candidates
be
chargeable?
the
election
of
a
school
member
is
probably
more
important
to
the
education
union
than
any
other
decision
that
occurs.
but
it's
in
a
process
which
the
state
has
excluded
from
bargaining.
and
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
basic
question
of
what
type
of
scrutiny
this
court
applies
when
we're
dealing
with
infringements
on
first
amendment
rights.
the
court
has
said
that
even
requiring
the
employee
to
pay
for
the
costs
of
bargaining
on
his
own
behalf
significantly
impacts
on
his
first
amendment
rights.
here
we're
talking
about
making
him
pay
for
bargaining
on
behalf
of
other
employees.
therefore,
as
to
him
those
aren't
his
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
those
are
matters
of
industrial
relations
and
in
the
public
sector,
politics.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so
because
it's
outside
the
process.
it's
still
in
the
normal
political
processes.
if
you
say
that
they
can
lobby
on
that,
then
why
can't
they
lobby
against
an
increase
in
the
budget
for
social
welfare
programs,
because
if
those
increase
the
amount
of
money
available
for
education
is
decreased?
why
can't
they
lobby
for
increased
in
the
income
tax,
because
that
money
can
be
spent
for
education?
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
a
program
to
register
and
vote,
your
honor?
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
think
that
clearly
would
be
nonchargeable.
i
think
it
is
under
this
court's
prior
decisions.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
not
constitutionally
chargeable
to
the
objecting
employee...
program
to
register
and
vote,
as
i
understood
the
court's
question.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
they
could
publish
it.
we're
not
talking--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--but
i
do
not
believe
they
could
use
the
dissenters'
dues
for
that,
your
honor.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
answer
is
clear
under
abood
and
this
court's
decisions
in
the
private
sector.
that's
not
even
as
close
as
the
question
of
funding
of
higher
education.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
yes,
justice
scalia.
i--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i
don't
think
the
activity
has
to
be
illegal
for
it
to
be
not
chargeable.
the
point
is
for
an
activity
to
be
chargeable
to
the
dissenting
nonmember
it
has
to
be
justified
by
a
governmental
interest.
and
the
state
of
michigan
has
no
interest
in
compelling
nonmembers
to
make
threats
of
an
illegal
act.
the
fact
that--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
no,
what--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--the
governmental
interest,
your
honor,
is
in
reimbursing
the
employee...
the
union
for
its
cost
of
performing
its
statutory
functions.
if
the
state
interest
were
in
higher
wages
and
benefits
for
public
employees,
it
could
accomplish
that
purpose
without
an
agency
fee.
it
could
simply
pass
legislation
increasing
wages
and
benefits.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
but
that's
not--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
part
of
the
negotiating
process
any
more
than
it
would
be
if
the
ferris
faculty
association
had
gone
out
and
hired
the
mafia
to
threaten
ferris
state
college
that
they
would
break
the
legs
of
the
members
of
the
board
of
control--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
i'm
saying--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
have
held
in
the
male
case,
which
we
cite
in
the
briefs,
that
it
was
against
the
public
policy
of
michigan
to
require
the
nonmembers
to
contribute
to
a
fund,
a
strike
fund,
which
would
in
the
future
be
used
to
fund
strikes.
and
the
existence
of
that
fund
obviously
threatens
employers
just
as
much
as
the
threats
in
this
case,
yet
it
was
held
to
be
against
the
public
interest
of
michigan
to
require
the
nonmembers
to
support
that
preparation
for
a
strike
which
would
be
illegal
under
michigan
law.
and
i
would
also
add,
justice
scalia,
that
the
record
directly
contradicts...
the
record
as
to
the...
the
internal
union
documents
which
are
in
evidence,
directly
contradict
the
testimony
of
the
union
witness
who
said
that
this
was
merely
a
bargaining
employee.
if
you
read
those
documents
which
are
cited
in
that
part
of
our
brief
you
will
see
that,
when
they
are
talking
to
each
other
in
private,
the
union
intended
to
go
out
on
strike,
that
those
were
real
preparations
for
a
real
strike
which
just
happened
not
to
occur.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
question
of
what
kind
of
activity,
whether
a
particular
type
of
activity
is
a
question
of
law.
in
fact,
is
a
content-based
regulation
of
speech,
as
the
court
said
in
riley
v.
national
federation
of
the
blind,
when
you
are
making
a
decision
as
to
whether
somebody
would
be
compelled
to
make
a
speech
that
they
would
not
on
their
own
make,
that
by
definition
is
a
content-based
regulation
of
speech.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
but
this
court
held
in
abood--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and
in
elrod
that
requiring
those
financial
contributions
which
are
then
used
to
speak
on
issues
as
to
which
the
employee
is
in
opposition
is
tantamount
to
coerce
belief.
it
is
coerce
speech.
the
fact
that
it
was
done
through...
through
a
contribution
makes
it
no
less
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
as
the
court
said
in
abood.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct.
whether
a
particular
expenditure
fits
within
one
of
the
categories,
once
the
category
are
defined--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
was.
i
believe
that
the
monies
that
are
at
issue
here
were
used
to
pay
for
a
strike
headquarters
which
they
didn't
need
to
have
union
meetings.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
to
discuss
going
out
on
strike.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
was...
the
only
purpose
of
having
a
separate
strike
headquarters
instead
of
their
normal
meeting
place
was
to
threaten
the
college
with
what
would
be
an
illegal
act
had
it
occurred.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
your
honor,
there
was...
there
were
expenditures
on
informational
picketing.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
those
expenditures...
we
don't
have
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
in
the
record,
your
honor.
there
was
informational
picketing
that
went
on
during
this
period,
but
our...
that
informational
picketing
was
directed
at
the
general
public.
and
therefore,
under
this
court's
decisions
in
pickering
and
madison
joint
school
district,
is
public
discussion
of
matters
of
public
concern
as
to
which
the
nonmember
must
be
treated
for
first
amendment
purposes
as
a
citizen,
not
just
an
employee.
in
fact
in
madison
joint
school
district
the
situation
was
essentially
the
same.
the
employee
wanted
to...
spoke
publicly
on
an
agency
shop
proposal
then
in
negotiation.
and
this
court
held
that
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
make
that
speech,
that
it
was
a
matter
of
public
concern,
not
just
a
matter
of
employer/employee
relations.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
think
not
if
they're
picketing
publicly,
your
honor.
and
we're
not
just
talking
about
that
picketing
here,
your
honor.
we're
talking
about
buying
ads
in
the
local
newspaper,
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
was
not...
it
was
advertising
not
just
picketing
at
the
school
board
meeting.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
your
honor,
that's
not
this
case--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i
don't
know
the
specifics
of
it--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and
i
think
the
specifics
of
it
might
make
a
difference.
but
if
the
unions--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--were
merely
involved
in
the
technical
process
of
providing
testimony
at
a
state
legislative
hearing--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that
might
be
one
thing.
but
if
the
union
doing,
as
it
was
here,
not
just
testifying
at
a
hearing,
but
engaged
in
a
grassroots
lobbying
campaign,
putting
together
coalitions
of
citizens
and
teachers--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--buying
advertising,
that
is
core
first
amendment
activity
and
it
can't
be
charged--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--to
the
dissenter.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
even
in
your
hypothetical,
your
honor.
if
i...
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
one
of
the
questions
mr.
chanin
was
asked
was
whether
there
is
a
contract
which
guarantees
the
services
to
the
local
affiliate.
he
didn't
answer
that
question.
the
affiliation
agreements,
the
contract...
the
constitutions
of
the
michigan
education
association
and
national
education
association
are
in
the
record.
they
don't
guarantee
any
services
to
this
local,
and
in
fact
we
know
there
aren't
services
to
this
local
even
where...
a
guarantee
of
services...
even
in
the
years
where
there
is
this
crisis,
this
catastrophe
that
mr.
chanin
talks
about.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that
doesn't
make
it
analogous
to
insurance
or
a
service
contract,
your
honor.
there
is
no
legally
enforceable
right
to
receive
the
services.
the
only
legally
enforceable
right
that
the
local
has
is
to
participate
in
governance
of
the
national
and
the
state
organization.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
stipulated
that
if
the
state
and
national
organization
provide
services
directly
to
the
local--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that
a
portion
of
the
administrative--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
rule
that
this
court
has
laid
down
in
the
cases
all
the
way
through
hudson,
saying
that
the
union
has
to
prove
the
chargeable
cost.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
that
the
first
amendment
requires
a
proven,
compelling
governmental
interest
to
infringe
on
the
nonmember's
right
not
to
associate
with
this
union
and
in
any
way
support
any
of
its
activities.
and
the
only
compelling
governmental
interest
that's
been
identified
by
this
court
is
reimbursing
the
union
for
its
costs
of
performing
its
statutory
functions
as
exclusive
representative
of
the
bargaining
unit.
you
talk
about
the
hypothetical
of
a
contract.
the
question
then
becomes
does
this
contract
make
rational
sense?
are
there
actual
services
that
are
being
provided?
is
it
a
fraud
and
so
on?
but
that's
not
this
case.
there
is
not
contract
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that
was
the
largest...
one
of
the
larger
expenses.
there
are
others
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
there
was
one
payment
by
the
local
to
send
members--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--to
a
conference
held
by
the
state.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
most...
all...
except
for
that
one
payment,
it
was
all
at
the
state
or
national
level.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia
question,
ferris
is
never
going
to
get
its
opportunity
to
get
support
from
the
state
organization
for
a
millage
election,
because
ferris
never
gets
any
money
for
millages
under
state
law.
