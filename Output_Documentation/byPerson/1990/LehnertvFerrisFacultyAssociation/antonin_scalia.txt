justice
scalia
mr.
lajeunesse,
one
category
of
charges
that
you
say
were
improper
really
is
quite
different
from
the
others
in
that
you
concede
that
they're...
that
they're
not
part
of
the
legislative
process
and
you
can
see
that
they
do
narrowly
affect
the
particular
bargaining
in
the
bargaining
unit.
but
you
nonetheless
say
they
are
not
chargeable,
and
i'm
referring
to
the
costs
of
preparing
for
an
illegal
strike
which
never
occurs.
justice
scalia
now,
why
are
they
not
chargeable?
is
it
illegal
to
prepare
for
an
illegal
strike?
justice
scalia
well,
it...
it
has
no
governmental
interest...
i
mean,
it...
by
parity
of
reasoning
you
can
say
it
has
no
governmental
interest
in
paying
higher
wages
to
public
employees.
justice
scalia
so
then
nothing
is
chargeable,
because--
justice
scalia
--you
don't
want
these
bargaining
units
to
be
successful.
there's
no
governmental
interest
in
having
these--
justice
scalia
--but
one
of
its
statutory
functions
is
conducting...
conducting
negotiations
with
all
of
the
maneuvering
and
feinting
and
what
not
that
negotiations
entail.
certainly
if
they
walk
out
of
a
meeting
1
day,
drag
on
the
meeting
for
5
days
when
it
could
have
lasted
only
one,
but
that's
part
of
their
tactics,
you
say
that's
chargeable,
wouldn't
you?
justice
scalia
so
what
about
this
phony
preparation
for
a
strike
which
would
never
occur?
why
isn't
that
just
part
of...
it's
part
of
the
negotiating
process.
justice
scalia
now
you're
making
a
different
argument.
now
you're
saying
it's
illegal
to
prepare
for
an
illegal
strike.
justice
scalia
or
illegal
to
threaten
an
illegal
strike.
justice
scalia
they
don't
say
as
of
no
benefit.
they
say
does
not
pertain
to
their
bargaining
process.
justice
scalia
is
that
in
the
contract?
justice
scalia
is
that
in
the
contract
of
association
between--
justice
scalia
--you
don't
assert
it's
a
legal
obligation.
you
assert
it's
a
practical
obligation.
justice
scalia
you
certainly
make
the
union
movement
sound
like
a
very
business-like
operation.
i've
always
heard
it
called
the
movement.
i
thought
that
people
in
one
union
would
contribute
to
the
international
because
they
believed
in
unionism.
they
don't
care
whether
they're
getting
back
penny
for
penny
an
investment
that
they're
making
in
the
international.
there's
none
of
that
here?
justice
scalia
this
is
strictly
a
business
operation?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
of
course
it
is.
justice
scalia
so,
it...
what
is
your
answer
to
the,
to
the
hypothetical
questions
that
mr.
lajeunesse
asked?
specifically,
can
the
union
charge
to
nonunion
members
the
funds
necessary
to
mount
a
campaign
against
certain
candidates
for
the
school
board?
the
people
that--
justice
scalia
--that
they
will
be
negotiating
with.
surely,
that's
germane.
i
want,
i
want
a
real
softy
on
the
school
board,
so
i
mount,
you
know,
a
campaign
to
get
that
person
elected.
is
that
germane?
justice
scalia
all
right,
now
what
do
you
mean
by
electoral
politics?
justice
scalia
my
next
question
was
going
to
be
what
about
a
nonpublic
union.
it's
just
a...
it's
not
a
school.
nonpublic
union
and
according
to
mr.
lajeunesse,
what
if...
can
they
be
compelled
to
contribute
to
a
campaign
in
support
of
minimum
wage
laws
or
an
increased
in
the
amount
of
the
minimum
wage?
justice
scalia
as
i
said,
it's
a
private
sector
union,
not
a
public
sector
union.
justice
scalia
it's
not
electoral
politics.
it's
just
a--
justice
scalia
okay,
well,
what
are
they?
justice
scalia
well,
i
didn't
realize
that
you're
arguing
that
just
as
you
sort
of
buy
insurance
for
the
expert
negotiating
skills
needed
and
litigation
skills,
so
also
you
buy
assurance...
insurance
for
millage
elections--
justice
scalia
--that
since
the...
this
millage
doesn't
relate
to
me,
but
it
does
relate
to
another
union.
they
pay
for
mine.
i
pay
for
theirs.
it
all
comes
out
even.
justice
scalia
that
is
not
the
argument?
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
do
you,
do
you
think
the
first
amendment
draws
that
distinction
between
whether
you
have
a
contractual
right
to
get
that...
you
can
pay
out
the
money
and
charge
the
nonunion
members
if
you
have
contractual
right
to
get
the
assistance
for
it,
but
by
reason
of
the
first
amendment
you
can't
pay
it
out
if
it's
only
very
likely
that
de
facto
you're
going
to
get
the
assistance.
that's
a
first
amendment
line?
