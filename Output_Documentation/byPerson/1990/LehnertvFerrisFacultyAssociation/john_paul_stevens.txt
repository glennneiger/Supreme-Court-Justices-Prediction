justice
stevens
may
i,
may
i
just
ask
you
a
little
more
about
this
millage
point?
supposing
the
lobbyists
for
the
national
union
sought
more
money
for
faculty
salaries
in
colleges.
they
either
wanted
a
minimum
wage
or
just
wanted
more
appropriations
to
expand
the
faculties
and
new
curricula
and
so
forth.
would
you
say
that
was
permissible
or
impermissible?
justice
stevens
because
it's--
justice
stevens
--so,
so
you
really
don't
rely
particularly
on
the
fact
that
the
millage
happened
to
be
for
grammar
schools
and
so
forth
rather
than
colleges?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
your
argument...
let
me
put
this
way.
your
argument
on
that
point
is
much
like
your
argument
on
anything
outside
the
bargaining
unit
is
impermissible.
i
mean,
you
know,
conventions
and
for
the
national
organization
and
the
like.
justice
stevens
may
i...
may
i...
this...
your
asking
us
to
look
at
the
testimony
and
so
forth,
brings
to
mind
this
question.
to
what
extent
do
you
think
the
question
of
whether
an
activity
is
germane
is
a
question
of
law
or
a
question
of
fact?
and
the
reason
i
ask
that
is
i
guess
we
have
two
courts
who
have
wrestled
with
an
awful
lot
of
detail.
and
as
i
understand...
now
maybe...
maybe
my
recollection
is
incorrect,
that
with
respect
to
the
local
union,
you...
about
80
percent
or
something
like
that
of
their
activities
were
held
okay
to
be
charged,
but
as
respect
to
the
michigan
union
and
the
national
unit,
something
like
95
percent
of
those
were
held
to
be
impermissible.
so
you
substantially
won
the
case
as
to
michigan
and
any...
is
that...
is
my
recollection
right
on
that?
justice
stevens
but
nobody
is
being
compelled
to
make
a
speech.
they're
being
compelled
to
pay
money
to
a
union
representative
who
primarily
is
representing
their
collective
bargaining...
interest
and
may
incidentally
say
something
that
you
disagree
with.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
so
you
say
it's
a
pure
question...
each
of
these
issues
is
a
pure
question
of
law
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
well,
again,
on
this
strike
business,
i
mean,
a
lot
of
the
money
was
in
a
pot
there
that
they
said
might...
might
finance
a
strike
and
might
finance
negotiation.
it's
kind
of
mixed
the
little
bit,
the
use
of
that
fund
i
think.
justice
stevens
but
they
did
have
union
meetings
at
the
strike
headquarters?
justice
stevens
well,
and
their
bargaining
position.
justice
stevens
can
i
ask
you--
justice
stevens
--could
i
ask
you
one
other
hypothetical?
supposing
your
teachers'
salaries
were
fixed
by
statute,
would
it
be
impermissible
under
your
view
to
lobby
for
a
change
in
the
statutory
provisions?
justice
stevens
i
know
it
isn't--
justice
stevens
--but
our
salaries
are
fixed
by
statute
and
i
can...
if
not--
justice
stevens
--why
would
it
make
a
difference?
justice
stevens
no,
they
do
everything
you
object
to.
justice
stevens
yes,
that's
exactly
what
i'm...
that's
my--
justice
stevens
--and
you--
justice
stevens
--even
in...
even
in
my
hypothetical?
justice
stevens
mr.
chanin,
can
i
interrupt
for
a
second?
your
argument
it
seems
to
me
would
justify
the
total
assessment
of
the
dues,
a
portion
of
the
dues
that
was
charged
to
the
mea,
and
i
understand
the
district
court
found
about
97
percent
was
impermissible.
justice
stevens
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
and
we're
fighting
about
a
little
squib
at
the
tiny
end
of
the
thing.
justice
stevens
you
didn't
meet
your
burden
of
proof.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
chanin--
justice
stevens
--what
you're
really
arguing
is
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
because
you're
saying
that
everything
is
presumptively
support
function
except
those
things
you
can
identify
as
unrelated,
and
the
stuff
in
the
gray
area
just
generally
is
supporting
affiliation.
justice
stevens
in
the
district
court
that
was
the...
the
burden
was
just
the
opposite.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
you
say
you
carry
it
when
you've
shown...
when
you've
excluded
a,
b,
and
c,
which
are
admittedly
impermissible,
everything
else
is
presumptively
necessary
to
show
that
the
organization
is
available.
justice
stevens
but
in
this
case
isn't
the
actual
thing
we're
fighting
about
is
how
much
of
this
publication
that
they
put
out
is
useful
to
the
local?
isn't
that
what
the
big
expense
was?
