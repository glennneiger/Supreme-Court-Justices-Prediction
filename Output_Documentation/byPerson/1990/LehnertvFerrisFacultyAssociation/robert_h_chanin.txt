mr.
robert
h.
chanin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
help
establish
a
context
i
would
like
to
begin
by
very
briefly
commenting
about
the
nature
of
the
three
unions
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
the
first...
and
to
clarify
my
acronyms
also.
the
ferris
faculty
association,
ffa,
is
the
bargaining
representative
for
a
unit
of
500
faculty
members
at
the
college.
it
is
a
small
local
union
which
in
the
year
in
question,
1981
and
'82,
had
a
budget
of
some
$18,000.
ffa
is
affiliated
with
two
much
larger
unions
with
substantially
greater
and
more
diverse
resources.
at
the
state
level
it's
affiliated
with
the
michigan
education
association,
mea,
which
in
that
year
had
a
budget
in
excess
of
$18
million;
and
at
the
national
level,
it's
affiliated
with
the
national
educational
association,
the
nea,
which
had
resources
in
excess
of
$70
million.
the
courts
below
held
that
the
petitioners
may
be
charged
for
the
course
of
certain
activities
engaged
in
by
mea
and
nea.
because
these
activities
did
not
directly
involve
the
collective
bargaining
process
at
ferris
state
college,
petitioners
contend
that
they
are
in
effect
being
asked
to
subsidize
employees
in
other
bargaining
units
represented
by
mea
and
nea
to
pay
for
services
provided
to
these
other
employees
which
is
of
no
benefit
to
the
members
in
their
own
bargaining
unit.
the
petitioners
are
wrong.
that--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--they're
wrong...
they're
wrong
in
that
as
well,
your
honor.
their
characterization--
[laughter]
their
characterization
fundamentally
misstates
the
situation,
and
it
totally
misses
the
point
of
union
affiliation
and
its
purpose.
affiliation
is
essentially
a
pre-paid
delivery
service
by
which
larger
parent
organizations
help
its
local
affiliates
to
carry
out
their
representational
responsibilities,
not
in
the
sense
that
justice
o'connor
asked,
not
merely
to
strengthen
the
local
unions
in
a
general
sense.
it
is
to
provide
them
with
resources
and
services
in
the
collective
bargaining
area
on
an
as-needed
basis.
in
abood,
this
court--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--which
contract?
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it's
in
the
essence
of
affiliation,
your
honor,
in
three
respects.
one,
the
contract
of
affiliation
is
indeed
a
contract
between
parent
organizations
and
locals.
the
guidelines
and
the
policies
of
the
parent
organizations,
many
of
which
are
in
the
record
in
this
case,
obligate
the
parent
organization
to
provide
assistance
to
the
local
in
a
variety
of
collective
bargaining-related
areas.
and
the
most
important
enforcement
mechanism
here
is
political
reality.
if
a
parent
organization
failed
to
respond
to
one
of
our
locals
when
it
needed
us
in
a
collective
bargaining
crisis,
we
would
not
be
the
parent
organization
as
soon
as
that
crisis
ended.
so
we
must
indeed
respond,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
yes,
it
is
built
into
the
very
nature
of
the
affiliation
relationship.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
that's...
it's
even
questionable
on
legal.
i
think
it
is
unquestionably
a
practical
obligation.
i
am
not
sure
that
locals
would
not
have
a
cause
of
action
under
state
law
to
enforce
the
policies
and
guidelines
of
the
parent
organization.
it
never
comes
to
that,
because
it
is
overwhelmed
by
the
political
reality.
we
must
respond
to
those
needs.
what
this
court
stated
in
abood
was
that
the
designation
of
a
union
as
an
exclusive
representative
carries
with
it
great
responsibilities.
it
referred
to
the
difficult
and
continuing
tasks
and
indicated
that
to
carry
out
these
functions
a
bargaining
representative
needs
the
service
of
lawyers,
expert
negotiators,
economists,
a
research
staff,
as
well
as
general
administrative
personnel.
what
has
happened
here
is
by
selecting
as
a
bargaining
representative
a
local
union
that
was
affiliated
with
larger
parent
organizations,
the
majority
of
employees
in
the
ferris
college
bargaining
unit
have
chosen
to
provide
and
fund
certain
of
those
responsibilities
on
a
unit...
a
cross
unit
basis
with
a
sharing
of
the
risks
in
which
all
of
the
people
who
benefit,
the
members
and
the
feepayers,
are
charged
a
periodic
uniform
flat
fee.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
your
honor--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--it
hurts
me...
it
hurts
me
to
say
that--
[laughter]
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--that
is
not
the
sole
basis
for
affiliation.
it
is
partially
there,
and
it
is
part
of
why
people
join
unions--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--but
unionism
is
a
competitive
area.
there
are
unions
competing
on
a
day-to-day
basis
for
the
allegiance
of
employees.
the
ones
who
get
those
employees,
the
ones
who
are
voted
in,
are
the
ones
who
can
deliver
when
they
are
called
upon.
and
delivery
in
a
collective
bargaining
sense
means
when
a
local
has
a
crisis,
a
crisis
beyond
its
own
means
to
deal
with,
the
parent
organizations
are
there.
they
are
there
with
what
the
court
referred
to
in
abood,
the
lawyers,
the
negotiators,
and
the
research
people.
now
petitioners
contend--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--well,
the
97--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--yes.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
let
me
just
clarify
the
factual
finding
of
the
court
and
then
respond
directly
to
your
question,
justice
stevens.
the
lower
courts
held
we
only
could
get
3
percent
and
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
it
was
quite
likely
we
put
in
substantially
more
in
terms
of
chargeable
activity.
the
court's
position
was
we
blew
it
on
the
proofs,
on
evidence.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
we
didn't
meet
the
burden.
the
theory
that
you
espouse,
why
don't
we
charge
them
100
percent,
breaks
down
for
this
reason.
the
vast
bulk
of
the
affiliation
fee
is
for
this
availability.
that's
what
it's
mostly
for,
but
we
all
know
that
is
not
the
total
of
the
affiliation
fee.
in
addition,
a
small
portion
of
the
affiliation
fee
pays
for
member-only
benefits
that
the
parent
organizations
provide.
it
does
pay
for
some
ideological
or
political
activity
that
is
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining.
if
we
charge
the
feepayers
the
full
amount
of
the
fee,
they
would
be
paying
a
disproportionate
percentage
for
the
availability
component
as
compared
to
the
members.
so
what
we
need
in
essence
is
a
pricing
mechanism.
we
need
a
discounting
mechanism.
how
do
we
take
that
affiliation
fee
to
the
parents
and
kick
out
that
small
portion
that
isn't
for
availability?
there
is
in
fact
no
perfect
way
to
do
it.
what
we
have
in
essence
done
is
taken
the
guidance
that
this
court
has
given
us
in
a
slightly
different
context
of
how
you
analyze
out
a
union's
budget.
and
what
we
have
said
about
the
parent
organizations
is
we
will
discount
out
those
things
that
we
really
can
charge
for
by
looking
at
what
activities
are
germane
to
collective
bargaining
in
the
generic
sense.
in
a
conceptual
way,
your
honor,
what
we
say
is
this.
those
parent
organizations
constitute
a
pool
of
resources,
a
pool
that
this
local
or
any
other
local
can
draw
on
in
times
of
need.
and
what
we
do
is
we
say,
in
a
generic
way,
what
types
of
resources,
what
types
of
skills,
what
types
of
activities,
fit
within
that
resource
pool,
and
that's
why
we
make
that
kind
of
a
deduction
from
the
affiliation
fee.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
let
me
say
about
that
holding
in
ellis.
that
was
a
statutory
holding.
the
court
began
by
analyzing
what
of
the
activities
in
question
were
chargeable
under
the
railway
labor
act,
and
only
as
to
those
activities
that
it
found
met
the
standard
under
the
railway
labor
act
did
it
address
directly
the
constitutional
issue.
the
litigation
never
crossed
that
bridge.
so
what
we
have
with
litigation
then
is
basically
a
statutory
holding.
but--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--yes,
you
have,
your
honor.
and
i
have
no
question
but
that
ellis
in
many
respects
sets
the
basic
test
for
first
amendment
adjudication
and
indeed
this
court
recognized
this
last
term
in
keller
when
it
applied
it
to
a
constitutional
base.
but
in
ellis
itself,
as
far
as
not
the
test,
but
the
application
of
that
test
to
specific
items,
the
court
only
applied
the
constitutional
test
to
those
items
it
had
found
chargeable
under
the
rla
and
litigation
of
a
general
nature
did
not
make
it.
but
having
answered
it
that
way
and
attempted
to
distinguish
ellis
my
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
under...
first
of
all,
i
believe
litigation
may
have
a
different
meaning
in
the
public
sector
in
any
event.
but
under
our
theory
in
which
you
are
paying
for
the
availability
of
this
service,
i
do
believe
the
litigation
would
be
brought
in.
because
it's
not
relevant
whether
the
specific
activity
in
the
resource
pool
of
the
parent
organizations
is
done
on
behalf
of
ferris.
it
is
whether
it
is
an
activity
in
the
generic
sense
that
is
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
but
let
me
look
at
the
other
points
of
ellis
if
i
may.
what
ellis
did,
and
i
think
the
focus
when
we
look
at
ellis
should
be
on
the
three
items
that
the
court
did
indeed
find
chargeable
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
clearly
within
the
constitutional
range
as
well.
and
there
are
three
activities
there.
one
was
a
national
convention,
that
is,
a
convention
that
dealt
with
all
of
the
bargaining
units
represented
by
brac,
not
simply
western
airlines.
it
allowed
social
activities.
these
were
not
social
activities
that
took
place
in
san
diego,
wherever
western
airlines
is
located.
these
were
social
activities
of
the
international
union.
and
it
allowed
chargeable...
as
chargeable
the
national
publication
which
reported
on
a
variety
of
activities
engaged
in
by
the
international,
many
or
indeed
most
of
which
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
western
airlines
bargaining
unit.
now
in
the
briefing,
the
petitioners
attempt
to
distinguish
that
publication
point.
what
they
say
is
the
literal
language
of
ellis
was
you
can
only
charge...
you
can
only
charge
for
writing
up
what
you
can
charge
for
doing.
and
therefore,
to
say
they
sustained
a
national
publication
doesn't
make
our
point.
but
it
does,
if
you
read
the
holding
in
the
case.
of
course,
at
the
very
point
where
the
court
in
ellis
said
you
can
only
charge
for
what
you
have
in
that
publication
that
you
can
actually
charge
for
doing,
it
dropped
a
footnote.
and
the
footnote
was,
and
therefore,
you
cannot
charge
for
the
litigation
and
the
organizing,
both
of
which
it
took
out.
and
the
holding
in
the
case
was
to
remand
to
the
lower
court
simply
to
excise
out
of
chargeability
to
two
activities
it
had
incorrectly
held
chargeable
under
the
rla:
organizing
and
general
litigation.
the
petitioners
contend
in
this
case
that
this
multi-unit
cost-sharing
system
violates
their
first
amendment
rights,
and
that
they
can
only
be
required
to
pay
their
share
of
the
actual
services
delivered
by
the
parent
organizations
to
them
on
a
pay-as-you-go
basis.
whatever
we
have...
may
have
put
in
in
a
particular
year
in
dealing
with
their
employer
is
all
that
they
can
pay.
let
me
make
clear
here
what
the
legal
issue
is.
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
type
of
pay-as-you-go
delivery
system
that
the
petitioners
urge
is
constitutional.
the
question
is
rather
whether
the
constitution
requires
every
bargaining
unit
to
use
that
system
or
whether
the
state
of
michigan
can
constitutionally
conclude
that
it
would
like
to
reject
that
system
and
that
a
cross
unit,
a
risk-sharing
type
of
system
as
we
have
here
fulfills
or
advances
the
state's
interest
in
labor
peace
and
stability.
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
affiliation,
the
answer
to
this
question
is
clear.
the
aggregated
payments
that
mea
and
nea
get
are
not
used
simply
to
defray
the
actual
cost
of
providing
services
to
the
ferris
local
or
to
other
locals.
they
are
used
to
establish
and
maintain
the
type
of
institution
with
an
expert
staff
of
lawyers,
of
negotiators,
and
of
researchers
that
is
available
when
called
upon
by
ferris
or
any
other
local
to
provide
these
services
on
an
as-needed
basis.
now,
if
in
fact
the
petitioners
simply
paid
for
the
services
that
they
received
in
a
particular
year,
they
would
really
be
freeloading
or
free
riding
on
two
specific
values
of
affiliation.
they
would
be
not
contributing
to
the
costs
incurred
by
a
parent
union
in
assembling
and
maintaining
the
type
of
institution
that
is
necessary
to
be
available
when
called
upon.
and
indeed
the
mere
fact
that
it
has
large
affiliates
and
that
it
has
resources
to
call
upon
is
itself
of
present
value
to
the
union.
it
affects
its
day-to-day
operation.
we
don't
have
to
squirrel
away
money
as
a
reserve
fund
for
the
year
in
which
we
may
have
catastrophic
costs,
a
year
we
bargain
a
contract,
a
year
we
have
major
arbitrations.
we
can
do
our
day-to-day
services
knowing
we
have
that
to
call
on.
and
the
fact
that
we
have
that
to
call
on
has
an
impact
on
the
employer.
any
prudent
employer,
knowing
we
are
backed
by
the
mea
and
the
nea,
will
take
that
into
account
in
its
dealing
with
the
local
union.
we
are
aware,
your
honors,
of
no
first
amendment
principle
which
would
require
the
state
of
michigan
to
adopt
a
unit-by-unit
pay-as-you-go-system.
we
think
it
is
a
reasonable
and
constitutionally
allowable
judgment
for
the
state
of
michigan
to
conclude
that
a
cross
unit
risk-sharing
system
of
providing
services
through
affiliation
is
constitutional.
and
i
would
note
to
you
that
every
other
legislature
which
has
looked
at
this
question
has
made
the
same
judgment,
and
that
is
why
the
overwhelming
majority
of
employees
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
bargaining
units
in
this
country
have
chosen
to
carry
out
their
representational
functions
by
an
affiliation
arrangement
where
they
operate
on
a
multi-unit
cost
basis
and
share
the
risk.
let
me
turn
now,
if
i
may,
to
the
second
issue
presented.
the
specific
activities
that
the
court
below
charged
the
petitioners
for.
because
this
court
indicated
that
an
agency
shop
has
an
impact
on
the
first
amendment
rights
of
objecting
feepayers,
petitioners
argue
that
they
can
only
be
required
to
pay
for
those
activities
that
are
essential
or
necessary
to
the
union's
performance
of
its
statutory
functions.
phrased
otherwise,
we
can
only
charge
them
for
things
that
the
local
union
must
do
pursuant
to
a
statutory
obligation
or
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
but
that
argument,
your
honors,
is
squarely
at
odds
with
the
position
taken
by
this
court
in
abood,
in
ellis,
and
in
keller.
as
those
cases
make
abundantly
clear,
the
test
is
not
essential
or
necessary.
the
test
is
as
justice
white
asked
in
the
question,
is
it
germane?
is
it
reasonably
related
to
the
function
of
the
bargaining
representative
in
collective
bargaining?
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it's
germane,
but
the
answer
is
still
no.
it's
the
only
one
of
your
hypotheticals
that
it's
no
to,
by
the
way,
justice
scalia.
the
court...
this
court
and
the
legislators
have
always
treated
campaigns
for
elective
office
differently.
since
the
earliest
railway
labor
cases
right
up
through
keller,
this
court
has
carved
out
electoral
politics
as
a
nonchargeable
item.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
mean--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--are
you
talking
in
the
public
sector
or
the
private
sector?
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
think
the
question
in
the
private
sector
is
a
more
difficult
one.
i
could
not
answer
it
unless
i
was
familiar
with
the
industry
and
the
particular
legislation.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
but
the
test
is--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--supporting
a
particular
statute.
--the
test
is
it
germane.
the
electoral
politics
is
indeed
germane.
it
is
germane.
there's
no
question
that
if
a
school
board
candidate
says
to
us,
vote
for
me,
i'll
give
you
a
10
percent
increase.
it
is
not
chargeable
for
other
reasons.
because
this
court
has
always
treated
campaigns
for
office
differently.
there
are
other
state
interests
involved
in
campaigns--
--is
that
the
reason?
it's
different
because
we've
always
treated
it
differently.
i
mean,
we
must
have
had
some
reason
for
treating
it
differently.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--there
are
reasons.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
the
reason
it's
been
treated
differently
is
because
when
i
vote
for
a
candidate,
i
don't
vote
on
a
single
issue.
that
person
will
sit
in
an
office
and
will
vote
on
a
variety
of
other
issues
which
may
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
collective
bargaining
for
my
position
as
a
union.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
manner
of
less
or
more
free
expression.
the
test
is
is
it
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
the...
in
this
case,
your
honor,
we
have
not
taken
the
position
that
we
can
simply
go
out
and
become
involved
in
any
type
of
activity
that
may
somehow
improve
the
economic
posture
of
the
employer.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
are
with
specific
activities
that
relate
to
the
funding
of
public
education
and
educational
employees.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
okay.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
yes,
your
honor,
let
me
tell
you
why.
in
abood,
this
court
referred
to
some
of
the
unique
characteristics
of
public
sector
bargaining,
and
it
stated
in
abood
that
the
bargaining
representative
is
the
public
employer
who
sit
at
the
table
are
not
free
agents
economically.
it
pointed
out
that
they
cannot
make
commitments
and
carry
them
out.
what
the
court
said
in
abood
is
whether
or
not
you
can
get
benefits
and
salaries
in
the
public
sector
is
dependent
upon
tax
rates
and
governmental
budgets
and
i
think
the
court's
phrase
was
on
budgetary
decisions
by
others.
now
the
court
was
not
saying
that
simply
as
a
unique
characteristic
of
public
sector
bargaining.
it
was
saying
that
that
is
a
factor
that
determines
whether
we
will
do
what
we're
supposed
to
do
in
bargaining,
whether
we
will
achieve
for
the
people
we
represent
salaries
and
economic
improvements.
if
in
fact
the
people
who
sit
at
the
table
cannot
make
those
decisions
without
budgets,
without
money,
without
millage,
we
must
participate
in
those
activities
to
effectively
carry
out
our
job.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
we
do
not
attempt...
if
i...
you
have
to
interplay
here
our
parent
organization
availability
theory
with
what
the
local
does.
we
do
not
seek
to
sustain
the
millage
elections
here
because
they
will
have
a
direct
impact
on
ferris.
we
sustain
them
because
they
are
germane
to
collective
bargaining
of
the
unions
involved
in
this
case
and
they
are
part
of--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it
supports
the
local
unions
that
do
it.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
it
does
not.
but--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--no.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no.
let
me
try
it
again--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--if
i
may.
the
argument
is
that
like
insurance,
not
exactly
but
like
insurance,
when
i
affiliate
with
these
larger
parent
organizations
i
get
something.
i
know
that
in
a
year
where
i
have
very
high
bargaining
costs,
a
year
i
negotiate
a
contract,
a
year
i
have
major
arbitrations,
i
can
call
on
those
parent
organizations
to
help
me.
in
order
to
be
there
when
i
need
them,
those
parent
organizations
must
maintain
themselves
as
an
institution.
they
must
have
a
staff
of
lawyers,
of
negotiators,
of
research
people,
of
whatever
i
need,
they
must
have
that
staff
and
those
resources
available
to
provide
to
me.
now
taking
justice
stevens'
point,
in
fact
if
i
carry
that
through
i
should
charge
the
people
in
ferris,
the
objecting
feepayers,
the
full
amount
of
the
affiliation
fee,
because
that
fee
goes
to
maintain
that
institution.
but
then
we
have
the
problem
of
a
disproportionate
charge.
so
we
have
to
come
up
with
a
pricing
mechanism.
how
do
i
discount
the
affiliation
fee
to
reflect
only
the
availability
component?
there
is
no
way
to
do
that
with
absolute
precision.
so
i
look
at
the
budgets
of
the
parent
organization.
i
say
what
should
i
take
out?
i
will
certainly
take
out
member-only
benefits.
i
will
take
out
that
portion
of
the
parent
organization
budget
that
goes
to
political
and
ideological
activity
that
has
no
relation
to
collective
bargaining
in
the
generic
sense.
but
as
i
try
to
construct
a
pool
of
resources,
i
say
that
what
i
will
keep
in
are
all
of
the
resources
that
go
from
those
parent
organizations
to
do
the
kinds
of
things
that
would
be
germane
to
collective
bargaining
if
done
in
any
kind
of
a
bargaining
unit,
if
done
in
ferris.
and
they
are.
the
costs
of
negotiation,
the
costs
of
research,
the
costs
of
lobbying
on
funding
public
education
and
on
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
so
we
sustain
those
charges,
not
because
i
can
take
a
particular
activity
of
a
state
or
national
parent
and
say
this
activity
had
this
direct
benefit
on
ferris
college.
i
keep
it
in
because
i
say
it
is
the
type
of
activity
that
is
in
the
resource
pool
that
the
local
is
paying
for.
the
only
activities
that
i
have
to
show
under
our
theory
have
a
direct
impact
on
bargaining
at
ferris
are
the
expenditures
of
ferris
itself.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
let
me
just
take
the
millage
if
i
may
because
you
mentioned
that,
your
honor.
in
abood,
this
court
stated
that
funding
to...
lobbying
to
fund
agreements
that
were
made
to
subsequently
fund
them
is
a
chargeable
expense
and
the
petitioners
concede
that.
millages
in
michigan
occur
all
through
the
year
under
law.
there
is
no
principal
reason
we
submit
to
allow
the
unions
to
charge
for
activities
to
improve
funding
that
take
place
after
bargaining
to
allow
the
public
employer
to
fund
contingently
agreed-to
economic
items,
as
opposed
to
allowing
the
union
to
charge
for
activities
that
are
designed
to
produce
the
funding
before
bargaining
so
that
the
public
employer--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--it
produces
funding
for
public
education
generally.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
yes,
i
am.
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
it
is
the
type
of
activity
that
a
parent
organization
legitimately
can
engage
in
in
order
to
have
the
institution
ready
to
assist--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--your
honor,
just
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
because
i
paid
health
insurance
last
year
and
did
not
have
a
major
illness,
i
do
not
consider
that
premium
to
be
wasted.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
unfortunately,
my
time
will
come.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
no.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
the
first
amendment
justifies
our
charging
the
parent
organization
expenditures
because
those...
that
expenditure,
that
affiliation
fee
is
germane
in
the
most
direct
sense.
it
is
a
fee--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--to
provide
something
to
help
me
when
i
need
it
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--no,
the
burden
of
proof
is
ours.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
we
lost
it
in
the
district
court,
because
we
had
an
activity
of
the
parent
organization.
the
district
court
did
not
say
we
did
not
sustain
it
because
we
did
not
show
how
it
related
to
ferris.
it
said
quite
clearly
we
did
not
sustain
it
because
we
did
not
show
how
that
activity
related
to
collective
bargaining
in
a
generic
sense.
