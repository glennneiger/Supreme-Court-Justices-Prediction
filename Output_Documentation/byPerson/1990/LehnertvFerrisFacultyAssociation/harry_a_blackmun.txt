justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
second
case
is
no.
89-1217,
lenhert
against
the
ferris
faculty.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
and
it
concerns
the
propriety
of
the
use
of
dues
required
of
non-members
by
the
respondent,
ferris
faculty
association,
which
serves
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
the
faculty
of
michigan's
ferris
state
college,
a
public
institution.
the
case
did
not
easily
lend
itself
to
announcement
from
the
bench.
i
think
it
suffices
to
say
that
certain
non-member
faculty
objected
to
particular
uses
by
the
unions
of
their
service
fees
and
filed
suit
under
federal
statutes
claiming
violation
of
their
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
district
court
held
that
certain
of
the
expenditures
were
constitutionally
chargeable
to
petitioners,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment
in
part
and
reverse
it
in
part,
and
remand
the
case.
the
details
are
complex
and
are
revealed,
we
hope,
by
the
opinion.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
white
and
justice
stevens
have
joined
the
opinion
in
its
entirety.
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
large
part,
but
dissenting
in
part;
justice
scalia,
joined
by
justice
o'connor
and
justice
souter,
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
and
he
is
also
joined
in
part
by
justice
kennedy,
and
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
sorts
the
line
up
of
the
participants.
