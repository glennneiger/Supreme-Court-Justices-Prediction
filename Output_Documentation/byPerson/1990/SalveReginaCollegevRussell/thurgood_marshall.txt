justice
marshall
there's
no
rule
required
that
the
district
judge
be
a
member
of
that
state
court's
bar.
justice
marshall
so
that
if
the
district
judge
was
a
practicing
lawyer
in
the
state
and
the
district
judge
next
to
him
practiced
law
in
california,
there
would
be
a
different
rule?
justice
marshall
well,
what
do
want?
justice
marshall
should
ignore
where
the
man
practiced
law.
justice
marshall
i
use
the
word
ignore.
justice
marshall
do
you
buy
that?
do
you
buy
that
word?
justice
marshall
wouldn't
you
assume
that
he
knew
a
little
bit
more--
--especially
about
contracts?
--on
what
was
there?
justice
marshall
well,
why
did
this--
justice
marshall
--why
if
it's
just
2
and
2
make
5,
what
do
we
do?
justice
marshall
is
that
an
appeal
in
your
sense
of
the
word
when
you
use
the
word
appeal
but
you
give
absolute
deference
to
the
crowd
to
it?
justice
marshall
well,
some
people
say
it
does.
justice
marshall
haven't
you
been
arguing
that
you've
been
standing
up
there?
justice
marshall
haven't
you
been
arguing
in
this
case
that
it
means
that
there's
no
way
to
win?
justice
marshall
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
saying.
justice
marshall
you
said,
why
write
an
opinion.
justice
marshall
i
sure
do.
justice
marshall
do
we
have
to
give
deference
to
the
trial
court?
justice
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
marshall
i
said,
do
we
have
to
give
deference
to
the
trial
court?
justice
marshall
did
that
say
we
have
to?
justice
marshall
do
we
have
to?
do
you
say
we
have
to?
justice
marshall
would
it
be
all
right
if
we
say
in
due
deference
to
the
trial
court,
we
think
that
we're
wrong?
would
that
be
good
enough?
justice
marshall
judges
are
from
another
circuit.
justice
marshall
judge
timbers
is
from
the
first
circuit?
justice
marshall
so
you'd
say
that
that
applies
to
him,
too?
justice
marshall
deference.
justice
marshall
to
the
first
circuit?
justice
marshall
and
in
the
ninth
circuit,
he
would
be
charged
with
knowing
the
law
of
hawaii
as
law.
justice
marshall
huh?
would
he?
justice
marshall
no,
no.
justice
marshall
is
he
charged
with
knowing
all
of
the
local
law
that
the
local
circuit
judges
know?
