justice
kennedy
does,
does
it
apply
in
bankruptcy
cases,
do
you
know?
justice
kennedy
is
there
any
authority
where
deference
is
given
to
bankruptcy
judges
who
have
practiced
in
the
jurisdiction
or
are
most
of
the
reported
cases
just
referring
to
district
judges?
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
the
principle
would
be
the
same?
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
a
certification
procedure
in
this
state,
in
rhode
island?
justice
kennedy
but
there
are
any
number
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
practice
exclusively
in
the
criminal
area
and
not
in
the
civil
area
at
all,
isn't
that
true?
justice
kennedy
the
harvard
law
review
doesn't
say
the
supreme
court
is
not
clearly
erroneous
so
that
we
should
accept
their
judgment.
maybe
they
should.
[laughter]
what
would
you
do
with
a
district
judge
who
not
only
practiced
in
the
state
but
conducted
the
bar
exam
and...
for
a
refresher
course
for
the
bar
for
20
years?
justice
kennedy
--so
you're,
so
you're
advocating
to
keep
the
deference
rule
because
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything?
justice
kennedy
what,
what--
justice
kennedy
--what,
what
should
be
the
rule
if
there
is
more
than
one
district
in
a
single
state?
california
has
four
different
districts.
do
you
give
a
deference
to
each
district
judge
even
though
the
district
judges
may
come
to
contrary
conclusions
as
to
the
state
law?
justice
kennedy
so
the
ninth
circuit
affirms
in
one
case,
case,
reverses
in
the
other
case
even
though
the
issue
of
law
is
identical
just
because
the
district
judge
has
reached
a
different
conclusion?
