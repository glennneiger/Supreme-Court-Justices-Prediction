justice
blackmun
mr.
snow,
i
sat
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
decade
and
i
can
remember
in
that
court
when
we
had
a
judge
from
outside
the
circuit
sitting
by
designation
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
would
defer
to
him
on
a
matter
of
state
law
in
the
place
where
he
was
sitting
by
designation.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
does
it?
justice
blackmun
no,
who
was
sitting
by
designation
as
a
trial
judge
in
a
state
where
he
did
not
come
from.
justice
blackmun
i
should
ask
your
opponents
that.
that's
on
the
theory
that
the
soil
gives
you
the
expertise,
just,
just
being
there
on
the
spot.
[laughter]
justice
blackmun
even
though
those
appellate
judges
were
not
from
the
state
in
question?
justice
blackmun
this
is
true
in
the
panel
you
had,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
--did
you
mention
the
fact
that
it
might
be
a
cop-out
for
courts
of
appeals,
too?
it's
an
easy
way,
just
defer.
we
don't
have
to
bother
with
the
case.
get
on
with
the
next
one.
justice
blackmun
why
did
you
bring
this
case
in
federal
court?
justice
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
mr.
snow.
suppose
every
federal
district
judge
in
rhode
island
were
disqualified...
wasn't
graduated
from
college
or
something
and
judge
duffy
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york
were
assigned
to
sit
as
the
trial
judge.
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit
should
defer
to
his
interpretation
of
rhode
island
law?
justice
blackmun
why?
justice
blackmun
well,
what
if
there
are--
--well,
what
one...
excuse
me.
--there
are
three
judges,
one
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york?
justice
blackmun
yes,
but
it
would
have
been
nice
had
you
been
in
state
court
and
got
a
definitive
ruling
right
away.
justice
blackmun
on
the
other
hand,
your
answer
was
a
good
one
if
the
calendars
were
clogged
up.
justice
blackmun
he
not
only
sat,
he
wrote
the
opinion.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
first
case
is
no.
89-1629,
salve
regina
college
against
russell.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
issue
is
whether
a
federal
appellate
court
may
review
a
district
court’s
determination
of
state
law
under
a
standard
that
is
less
probing
than
that
applied
to
a
determination
of
federal
law.
respondent
filed
a
diversity
action
in
federal
court
alleging
that
the
petitioner,
college,
had
breached
an
implied
agreement
to
educate
her
when
it
asked
her
to
withdraw
from
its
nursing
program
for
failing
to
meet
certain
weight
loss
commitments.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
would
apply
the
commercial
doctrine
of
substantial
performance
in
this
academic
setting.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
respondent
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
it
held
that
appellate
deference
made
by
a
federal
judge
of
that
state
was
not
an
error.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
remand
the
case.
we
hold
that
a
federal
court
of
appeals
must
review
de
novo
a
district
court’s
state
law
determination
in
a
diversity
case.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
and

and
