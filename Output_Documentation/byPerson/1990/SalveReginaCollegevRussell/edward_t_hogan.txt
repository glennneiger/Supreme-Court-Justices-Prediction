mr.
edward
t.
hogan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun,
make
it
clear
that
the
respondent
disassociates
itself
completely
with
the
thought
that
there
is
some
intellectual
honesty
among
circuit
court
judges.
i...
to
the
contrary,
i
think
circuit
court
judges
do
in
fact
give
de
novo
reviews
to
every
issue
that
comes
before
them
and
conscientiously
exert
their
entire
intellectual
process
to
these
problems
and
then
make
a
resolution
one
way
or
another
that
the
circuit
or
the
district
judge
is
either
right
or
wrong
and
if
he's
right,
there
isn't
any
point
in
our
wasting
our
time
in
writing
a
long-winded
opinion
to
simply
gild
the
lily.
if
he's
wrong,
by
golly,
we'll
reverse
it
and
that's
what
they
do.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
and
sometimes
write
a
long-winded
opinion.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
in
many
instances,
they
do
that,
mr.
justice
scalia.
they
simply
say
that
we
affirm
on
the
basis
of
the
trial...
the
trial
judge's
or
the
district
judge's
determination
and
the
opinion
given
by
him.
in
this
particular
case,
the
trial
judge's
determination
was
a
bench
decision
in
the
heat
of
trial
and
didn't
have
the
long
exposition
that
might
take
place
if
he
had
a
day
or
two
to
consider
what
he
would
say
off
the
bench.
but
we're
dealing
here
not
with
any
kind
of
constitutional
issues.
we're
dealing
only
with
how
an
appellate
court
reviews
decisions
in
cases
that
are
of
precedential
value
only
in
the
case
before
the
court.
this
is
a
diversity
case.
and
diversity
cases
set
no
precedent
whatsoever,
because
the
very
next
day
the
state
supreme
court
can
rule
to
the
contrary
no
matter
how
erudite
and
how
deep
thought...
well
thought
out
the
circuit
court
opinion
may
be.
the
fact
is
that
the
very
next
day,
as
said
by
judge
brown
of
the
fifth
circuit
back
in
1963
when
he
said,
this
is
not
the
last
word,
speaking
of
the
circuit
court
opinions
in
diversity
cases.
he
says,
that's
only
the
latest,
and
before
the
slug
drops
at
a
st.
louis
linotype,
then
the
writing
texas
court
may
melt
down
the
lead
to
so
much
drops.
such
are
the
perils
of
diversity's
jurisdiction.
now
that's
exactly
what
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
only
you
can
do
that.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
no.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
totally
different
question.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
that--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--true
to
the
extent
that
in
the...
if
it
was
a
federal
issue,
then
of
course
you
have
an
opportunity
to
review
it
and
overrule
any
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision
involved
with
a
federal
question.
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
deal
with
diversity
cases,
the
lower
court
has
had
to
make
a
prediction.
he's
dealing
in
a
vacuum
in
a
way.
there's
no
determination
by
a
state
supreme
court
as
to
what
the
rule
is.
he,
therefore,
has
to
sort
of
divine
or
guess
as
best
he
can
what
a
supreme
court
would
do
at
a
later
date.
now,
that
is
a
prediction
that
really
is
nothing
more
than
that...
just
a
guess,
just
his
best
estimate
of
what
would
happen.
there
is
nothing
that
says
that
three
circuit
judges
sitting
in
the
quietude
of
their
chambers
make
them
any
best...
any
better
guesstimers
than
he
is.
not
really,
because
again
both
the
district
judge
and
those
circuit
court
judges
can
be
overruled
the
very
next
day
by
the
state
supreme
court.
and
those
circuits
sit
within
any
number
of
jurisdictions,
as
few
as
four
in
our
circuit
and
as
many
as
eight
or
ten
in
other
circuits.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
why
the
federal
court?
there
were
several
reasons.
first,
your
honor,
we
met
the
diversity
of
citizenship
test
at
the
time
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
trial
calendar
in
the
federal
court
in
providence
was
a
more
rapidly
reached
trial
than
what
we
in
the
state
supreme
court,
the
superior
court...
our
superior
court
in
the
state
court
has
a
crowded
calendar
of
some
4
to
5
years
to
a
trial
and
fortunately
the
federal
district
judges
in
providence
are
able
to
get
their
cases
out
within
12
to
18
months.
that
was
one
of
the
really
compelling
reasons
that
we
brought
the
case
in
the
first
instance.
it
languished
for
a
long
time,
because
judge
selya
had
the
matter
when
he
was
a
district
judge
and
reserved
decision
on
the
motion
for
a
summary
judgment,
and
that
took
some
period
of
time
before
that
decision
came
down,
and
when
he
did
come
down
with
his
decision,
he
said
he
would
hold
the
case
and
try
it
himself
when
he
could
get
off
the
circuit
court
long
enough
to
hear
it
at
the
district
court
level.
and
some
year
and
a
half
went
by
while
he
tried
to
do
that
and
ultimately
he
had
to
excuse
himself.
and
that's
why
it
ultimately
was
tried
by
a
different
judge.
so
the
delay
in
the
actual
trial
of
the
case
was
one
that
occurred
because
a
federal
judge
was
trying
to
accommodate
a
calendar
situation.
but
had...
these
cases
set
absolutely
no
precedent,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
turn
around
and
say
to
judges
on
circuit
courts
that
are
already
overburdened,
trying
to
find
time
to
write
opinions
in
cases
that
do
set
precedent,
that
when
you
agree
with
the
district
judge
that
he
was
right
in
his
interpretation
and
his
guess
as
to
what
a
state
supreme
court
would
do,
that
if
you
require
them
to
set
down
and
write
these
long
opinions
proving
2
and
2
are
4
or
reinventing
the
wheel,
it
seems
to
me
you're
putting
an
wholly
burden,
a
wholly
unnecessary
burden--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--upon
those
courts.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
well,
that's
a
different
problem.
if,
if
in
fact
they
determine
that
the
district
judge
is
wrong,
i
haven't
yet
seen
a
circuit
court
say,
well,
we
think
he's
wrong,
but
we're
going
to
reverse
it
because
we
don't
want
to
take
the
time
to
write
the
opinion.
i
have
seen
many
cases
where
they
said
we
would
normally
give
great
deference
or
great
weight
of
all
the
other
expressions
and
other
articulations
of
the
deference
rule.
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
a
firm
conviction
of
error
or
the
other
things
that
they
say
and
then
they
proceed
to
reverse
the
district
court.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your,
your
position.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i
don't
subscribe
to
the
concept
that
the
circuit
court
can
say
because
it's
a
tough
case
we'll
duck
it,
if
that's
what
you're
saying
to
me
in
other
words.
i
think
the
obligation
is
upon
the
circuit
court
to
review
every
case
that
comes
before
it
and
give
each
and
every
issue
that's
raised
by
the
parties
a
fair
hearing.
now
a
fair
or
meaningful
issue
doesn't
necessarily
mean
ipso
facto
that
they
give
it
a
de
novo
opinion.
i'm
not
at
all
certain,
not
being
privy
to
what
happens
in
circuit
court
judges'
chambers,
but
i
have
a
suspicion
that
when
the
circuit
judges
take
these
cases
under
advisement
that
they
confer
among
themselves.
they
confer
with
their
clerks,
et
cetera,
and
they
arrive
at
some
sort
of
a
decision
where
they
take
into
account
all
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
presented
to
them.
they
read
the
cases
or
have
them
read
and
consider
those
things
and
then
come
to
a
conclusion
the
district
judge
is
thoroughly
wrong.
so
and
so,
you
write
an
opinion
that
shows
where
he's
wrong
and
we'll
do
that.
or
they
could
prove
to
the
other
effect,
we
think
the
district
court
is
right.
we
don't
have
to
go
to
a
long-winded
discussion.
we
simply
use
the
judicial
shorthand
of
our
deference
rule.
we
don't
think
he's
unreasonable.
we
think
his
interpretation
is
a
fair
one.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i...
only
as
a
method
of
shorthand.
that's
what
i
called
it
in
my
brief.
it
is
a
way
for
the
court
frankly
to
avoid
the
waste
of
time
that
comes
of
writing
opinions
that
do
nothing
more
than
gild
the
lily
where
those
opinions
can
mean
nothing--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
thinks
contrary
within
a
matter
of
hours.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
you
do,
mr.
justice
kennedy.
and
the
reason
i
think
that's
clearly--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--that
is
a
very
possible
situation.
some
of
the
law
writers
indicate
that
to
be
true
and
i'm
aware
that
that
can
happen.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i...
that's
just
part
of
the
growing
aspect
of
the
law.
i
think
they
call
it
the
living
tree
of
the
law
and
consequently,
yes,
it
could
happen
that
in
the
given
vote...
jurisdiction
you
will
have
district...
different
determinations
of
the
same
issue
by
different
judges.
and
they
might
both
be
deferred
to.
that
can
happen.
i
can't
deny
that.
i'm
not
trying
to
say
it
doesn't
happen.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
by
the
same
circuit
court.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
precisely.
because
they
are
doing
it--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--well--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--well,
i
could
conceive
that
if
the
same
issue
comes
up
the
second
time
around
and
they
have,
let's
say,
deferred
to
a
district
court
judge
the
first
time
around
in
a
given
fashion
as
in
this
case,
let's
say,
that
the
district
judge
is
correct.
then
the
same
issue
comes
up
on
a
second
time
around
and
they
then
conclude,
well,
by
golly,
maybe
we
weren't
so
right
in
the
first
time.
then
they
could
sit
down
and
write
an
opinion
and
say
that
we
were
wrong.
they've
done
it
before.
there
are
other
cases
in
the
books
that
say,
well,
on
second
thought,
second
reflection,
we
think
it
contrary.
but
those,
the
instances
when
that
will
happen
are
rare
indeed
and
again
it's
a
question
of
the
exception
trying
to
prove
the
rule
and
i
think
the
fact
is
that
in
virtually
all
of
these
cases
you
deal
with
a
situation
where
the
circuit
courts
do
in
fact
perform
the
duty
that's
encumbered
upon
them
as
circuit
courts
to
give
the
parties
a
fair
and
meaningful
review
of
the
legal
issues
involved.
and
i'm
not
about
to
say
that
the
circuit
courts
don't
do
that.
to
the
contrary
i
believe
they
do.
and
i
don't
think
it's
required
in
order
to
give
a
litigant
a
fair
opportunity
to
have
his
legal
position
heard
that
it's
required
that
they
write
these
long
opinions
every
time
the
issue
comes
up.
you
know--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--well,
of
course--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--let
me,
let
me--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--let
me
answer
in
this
fashion,
mr.
justice
white.
first
of
all,
i
think
in
the
amicus
brief
it's
clear
that
there
are
only
about
1
or
2
percent
of
the
cases
that
are
heard
in
the
first
circuit
that
deal
with
diversity
of
citizenship
cases
out
of
the
state
of
rhode
island.
you
realize
that
rhode
island
is
a
rather
small
territory.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
no,
i
don't,
i
don't
feel
that
way.
and
i
don't
feel
that
most
lawyers
in
rhode
island
feel
that
way.
i
think
we
are
aware
of
the
longstanding
rule...
it
has
been
all
of
the
time
i've
ever
practiced...
that
the
circuit
courts
would
give
substantial,
great
weight
deference,
all
the
other
articulations
of
that
deference
rule
to
a
district
court
determination
of
state
law.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i'm
in
the
process
of
doing
one
now
to
be
heard
next
tuesday--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--and
i
hope
to
succeed.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i
don't
know
whether
i
will
or
not.
we'll
find
out.
i
think
it
all
boils
down
really
to
a
question
of
this
issue
of,
is
a
de
novo
review
required
in
this
type
of
a
case?
certainly
it's
not
required
by
the
constitutional
provision.
it's
not
even
required
by
statute
or
by
rule
of
court.
so
it
becomes
a
matter
of
whether,
as
a
matter
of
sound
administration
of
justice,
the
deferential
rule
makes
sense
in
these
particular
cases.
the
deferential
rule
is
not--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--well,
the
deference
rule
doesn't
require
absolute
deference.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i,
i
don't
know
of
a
case
that
i've
come
upon
that
says
the
deferential
rule,
as
i
refer
to
it
here--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--what's
that,
sir?
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
no.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
no,
that
isn't...
i
think
you
misunderstand
my
position.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
my
position
is
not
that
i...
the
court
should
not
write
an
opinion
just
for
the
sake
of
not
writing
opinions.
my
position
is
as
simple
as
this.
when
the
circuit
court
reviews,
as
it
does,
fairly
and
completely
the
issue
of
what
is
before
the
court
and
concludes
that
the
trial
judge
was
correct
or
that
his
interpretation
of
the
issue
is
reasonable
and
not
error-prone,
then--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--either,
either,
mr....
either
i
think
is
appropriate.
i,
i
believe
that--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--i
will.
i...
now
when
they
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
trial
justice
is
not
in
error,
that
his
position
is
reasonable,
how
ever
you
want
to
say
that,
that
they
are
not
prepared
to
overturn
them
or
reverse
it,
that
in
those
circumstances,
they
do
apply
what
i
call
the
deferential
rule.
and
they
defer
to
him
unless
they
conclude
that
he
is
thoroughly
wrong
or
in
error.
if
they
find
him
in
error,
they
do
not
hesitate
to
write
opinions.
i've
brief
cites
in
numerous
cases
to
that
effect
where
the
various
circuits
all
have
overturned
district
court
decisions
although
giving
voice
to
the
deferential
rule.
so
it
isn't
a
question
of
deference
and,
therefore,
it's
conclusively
presumed.
not
so
at
all.
this
is
not
a
question
of
conclusive
deference,
of
being
bound
by--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--mr.
justice
white,
until
the
ninth
circuit
came
down
with
its
opinion
in
the
matter
of
mclinn
back
in
1984,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
every
circuit
court
of
appeals
throughout
the
country,
if
they
were
of
that
position
would
have
said,
well,
why
we
think
if
it
were
a
matter
of
first
impression
with
us
we
would
rule
differently
than
the
district
judge.
we
don't
think
he's
wrong.
we
don't
think
it's
unreasonable.
we
will
not
substitute
our
judgment
for
his.
we
will
defer
and
affirm.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
well,
not,
not
quite,
because
in
the
area
of
federal
jurisdiction,
the
issues
are
a
little
bit
different
and
what
can
happen
to
the
federal
case
is
a
little
different
than
what
happens
in
the
diversity
case
where
the
state
law
issues
are
involved.
i...
in
the
federal
cases,
the
federal
courts
require
a
degree
of
expertise
that
the
state
courts
obviously
don't
get
and
contrary,
i
think
that
certain
state
courts
acquire
a
better
expertise
with
state
law
than
perhaps
federal
courts
do,
because
they
deal
with
different
issues.
when
the
district
court
is
required
to
find,
as
he
is
in
a
diversity
case,
a
state
law,
he's
pretty
much
on
his
own
unless
there
is
a
determination
already
ahead
of
him.
if
he
is,
he's
bound
by
that.
but
in
the
absence
of
any
definitive
ruling
by
the
state
supreme
court,
he
has
to
divine
what
he
thinks
it
is.
he
can
be
overruled
by
a
trial
judge
of
the
state
court.
that
isn't
quite
true
when
you
do
it
with
the
federal
court
deciding
regulatory
agencies'
interpretations.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
there's
nobody
to
overrule,
i
mean
except
the
circuit
court.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
on
a
diversity
case
in
the--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--yes,
and
then
when
the
ninth
circuit
came
down
with
the
mclinn
case
back
in
1984...
a
sharply
divided
court,
i
think
it
was
6
to
5...
they
held
there
for
the
first
time
that
i
could
i
any
case
that
said
flatly
that
henceforth
in
this
circuit
all
issues
of
state
law
will
be
decided
de
novo
and
on
a
plenary
basis
by
this
court.
i...
and
that
is
the
first
time
i
have
found
any
case
that
espouses
the
rule
that
flatly
and
that
broadly.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
it's
the
mc...
mclinn.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
it's
739
fed.
2nd
1395,
i
can
tell
you
that.
i...
it's
the
case
that
really
gives
rise
to
this
whole
issue,
because
there
for
the
first
time
circuit
courts
decide...
a
circuit
court
decided
that
these
state
law
issues
would
be
resolved
on
a
de
novo
basis
with
no
deference
whatsoever
to
a
district
court
judge's
ruling.
that
threw
the
whole
ball
of
wax
up
for
grabs
as
to
what
is
going
to
be
the
right
rule
to
apply
from
here
on.
and
i...
practically
every
circuit
with
the
exception
of
i
think
the
third
and
conceivably...
might
be
some
language
out
of
a
sixth
circuit
now
that
would
be
construed
to
be
a
de
novo
type
of
ruling
cited
by
the
amicus
in
this
case.
i'm...
all
the
other
circuits,
however,
have
continued
to
apply
the
deferential
rule.
there
are
cases
cited
in
my
brief
from
various
circuits,
i
think
the
first,
second,
fifth,
sixth,
seventh,
eighth,
and
tenth
that
all
postdate
the
mclinn
case
and
apply
the
deferential
rule
even
in
face
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
mclinn,
who
said
that
everything
should
be
de
novo.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i
most
certainly
do.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
because
he's
just...
he's
in
as
good
a
position
frankly
in
my
opinion
to
make
a
guess
as
to
what
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
will
do
as
are
three
judges
in
the
circuit
court
in
boston,
one
of
whom
comes
from
puerto
rico,
one
from
new
hampshire,
and
one
from
maine.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
if
five
judges
were
out
on
the
supreme
court
tomorrow,
say
those
three
are
wrong.
this
is
a
totally
different
situation.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
federal
law
where
there's
a
hierarchy
that
you
can
follow
neatly
all
the
way
up
to
this
august
bench.
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
where
anywhere
along
the
line
the
whole
thing
can
be
short-circuited
by
a
state
supreme
court
ruling
not
even
having
to
be
followed
by
trial
judges
in
rhode
island.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
well--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--we'd,
we'd
still
be
waiting
for
trial.
so
i
really
think
that
this
boils
down
to
a
question
of
whether
the
trial
judge
is
in
a
better
position
to
make
a
determination
than
is
a
circuit
court.
and
most
of
the
law
writers
say
that
he
is.
one
of
the
telling
points
that
was
tried
to
be
made
by
the
circuit
court
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
mclinn
case
was
that
failing
to
give
this
type
of
full-blown,
full-scale
legal
review
to
unsettled
law
questions
would
be
an
advocation
of
their
authority
and
their
position
as
such,
and
unfair
to
the
litigants.
judge
schroeder
in
her
dissent
makes
a
clear
point
in
refutation
of
that
position,
but
one
of
the
better
comments
that
i've
read
about
this
whole
issue
comes
from
judge
amentalot
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
case
of
arthur
young
against
reeves,
which
i
think
has
just
been
reversed
by
this
court
recently
under
the
name
of
reeves
against
ernst
and
young.
i...
but--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--do
you,
sir?
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i
don't
think
you
have
to
give
deference.
you
have
given
deference.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i
don't
think
you're
required
to
give
deference.
you
have
in
the
past
said
that
you
do
defer.
the
case
of
hori,
which
was
the
japanese
emigrant
case,
judge
powell
in
a
footnote
to
his
decision
referred
then
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
given
deference
to
different
district
court
judges'
determinations
of
state
law
issues.
in
bernhardt--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--i,
i
answered
your
question
i
think--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--i,
i
do,
i
do
not
say
you
have
to
give
deference.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
well,
well,
it
wouldn't
make
me
happy
in
this
particular
case,
if
that's
what
you're
asking
me.
[laughter]
i
think
you
have
the
power
to
say
that
and
the
legal
right
to
say
that.
would
it
be
all
right,
it
depends
on
how
you
say
that
to
me.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
well,
applying
it
to
myself
and
to
this
case,
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
i'll
accept
the
first
circuit
rule
and
be
happy
with
that--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--but
as
a
litigator
and
an
advocate
the
result
would
please
me
greatly
if
you
were
to
simply
say,
let
there
be
diversity
of
opinion
between
the
circuits
so
we
don't
care.
let
the
first
circuit
stand
on
its
own.
i'll
be
glad
to
accept
that.
whether
that's
good--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--as
a
example
of
the
administration
of
justice,
i
leave
to
your
honors.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
i
won't
dispute
that
either.
if
that's...
if
it's
comfortable
with
the
court
that
there
be
that
dichotomy
among
the
circuits,
it's
comfortable
with
me
because
we're
all
right
on
that
position.
but
as
a
matter
of
administration,
i
don't
know
whether
that's
good,
bad,
or
indifferent.
that
would
strike
me
as
not
being
very
good,
but--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--what's
that,
sir?
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
yes.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
well,
he
applied,
he
applied,
he
applied
the
rule
of
deference.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
yes,
he
applied
the
rule
of
deference.
the
second
circuit
still
adheres
to
the
rule
of
deference
so
i'd
still
be
with
him.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
well,
he
sat
on
the
first
circuit
by
designation.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
he
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
and
he
probably
dissented.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
just
as
any
other
circuit
court
judge
will
be
charged
with
knowing
within
the
first
circuit--
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
--the
law
of
rhode
island
because
he's
from
maine.
mr.
edward
t.
hogan
if
he's
going
to
sit
in
that
circuit,
i,
i
would
think
he'd
have
to.
in
any
event
it
seems
to
me
as
i
said
earlier
that
i...
this
comes
down
to
the
matter
of
plain
common
sense,
and
judge
arnold
said
so.
he
said,
you
know,
one
can
look
at
all
the
law
books
in
print
and
still
not
have
the
same
degree
of
reliable
judgment
on
legal
questions
as
a
lawyer
who
has
lived
and
practiced
for
years
in
a
jurisdiction.
there
is
such
a
thing
as
what
dean
pound
called
law
in
action
as
opposed
to
law
in
the
books.
each
state
has
its
own
distinct
legal
ethos
which
informs
and
qualifies
how
lawyers
and
judges
understand
what
is
written
in
the
law
books.
so
when
we
defer
to
the
opinions
of
district
courts
on
the
law
of
their
state,
we
are
not
shirking
our
responsibilities.
we
are
simply
using
common
sense.
i
think
that
concludes
my
arguments.
