chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-1629,
salve
regina
college
v.
sharon
russell.
mr.
snow.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
snow,
i
think
you
can
assume
that
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
factual
background
of
the
case
and
the
procedural
background
of
the
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
would
suggest
that
because
of
this
complexity
of
state
law
today,
that
a
court
of
appeals,
not
just
the
first
circuit
with
four
states
in
it,
but
a
court
of
appeals
like
the
ninth
circuit
with
maybe
10
or
11
states
in
it
should
try
to
decide
as
an
original
matter
questions
from
those
11
or
12
states.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ought
it
to
be
treated
any
differently
than
a
district
court's
decision
on
a
point
of
federal
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
no
deference
at
all
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
don't,
don't
you
think
it's
reasonable,
mr.
snow,
for,
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
a
judge
who
is
sitting
in
rhode
island
and
who
has
practiced
in
rhode
island
may
well
have
a
feel
for
what
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
would
do,
that
you
can't...
that
judges
who
have
never
practiced
there
can't
get
by
just
reading
the
decisions
of
that
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
judge
timbers
is
from
new
york.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
gone
on
for
centuries.
you
know
not
in...
not
in
terms
and
not
spoken
in
opinions,
but
you
know
they
talk
about
the
court
of
queen's
bench
in
the
19th
century
in
an
appeal
from
judge
keckquick,
but
there's
still
other
reasons
for
reversal.
[laughter]
so
that
goes
on
whether
spoken
or
not.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
snow.
mr.
hogan,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why,
why
don't
you
return
to
justice
marshall's
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hogan.
mr.
snow,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
snow.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
