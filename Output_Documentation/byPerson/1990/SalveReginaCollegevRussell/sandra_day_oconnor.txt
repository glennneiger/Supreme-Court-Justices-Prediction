justice
o'connor
well,
as
a
practical
matter
don't
you
think
most
of
the
circuits
have
for
years
pretty
much
gone
along
with
the
interpretation
of
state
law
given
by
the
district
judge
who
is
often
from
that
state
and
perhaps
familiar
with
the
state
law?
i
think
it's--
justice
o'connor
--uh-huh.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it's
just
a
common
sense
sort
of
a
feeling
that
the
district
court
judge
may
be
more
familiar
with
what
the
state
law
is
than
the
circuit
court
judges
generally,
who
may
or
may
not
come
from
that
state?
