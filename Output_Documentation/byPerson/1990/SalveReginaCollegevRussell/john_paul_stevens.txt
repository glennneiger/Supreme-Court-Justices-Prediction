justice
stevens
of
course,
that's
not
exactly
the
typical
case
even.
most
district
judges
are
residenced
where
they
sit,
aren't
they?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
well,
most
of
them
practiced
law...
most
of
them
practiced
law
in
the
jurisdiction
where
they
sit.
justice
stevens
there
are
very
few
judges
on
the
illinois
district
courts
who
didn't
practice,
in
fact,
there
are
none
who
didn't
practice
in
illinois,
same
in
indiana,
same
in
wisconsin.
i
don't
know
any
in
my
circuit
who
didn't
practice
in
the
district
in
which
they
sat.
justice
stevens
if,
if
you
had
thought
of
it
at
that
time,
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
prudent
for
him
to
interrupt
the
trial
to
take
the
time
to
certify
to
the
rhode
island
supreme
court?
justice
stevens
so
the
district
judge
kind
of
axed
it
as
peril,
is
what
it
amounts
to
i
guess.
justice
stevens
but
he
did
raise
it
the
day
before
he
made
his
ruling,
didn't
he?
justice
stevens
he
raised
it
and
then
he
announced
it
the
next
day.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
do
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
give
no
weight
at
all
to
the
district
judges,
absolutely
de
novo?
say
it
is
a
totally
unresolved
question.
i
had
one
of
those
when
i
was
a
circuit
judge.
there's
absolutely
no
law
in
the
point
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
we
had
to
decide
it.
should
we
just
pay
no
attention
to
the
district
court's
view
or
should
we...
well,
what
do
we
do?
justice
stevens
obviously
you
know
what
he
did.
justice
stevens
well,
you
review
it
and
you--
justice
stevens
--you
read
it
as
much...
read
everything
you
can
find
and
you
say,
well,
neither
the
illinois
supreme
court,
nor
the
appellate
court,
nor
an
illinois
trial
judge
that
i
can
find
has
ruled
on
the
precise
issue;
there
is
no
law
one
way
or
the
other.
we
must
decide
it
and
the
district
judge
said,
well,
i...
my
hunch
is
here
that
i
think
probably
they'd
go
this
way.
should
i
give
that
any
weight
at
all
or
should
i
just
go
ahead
and
flip
my
own
coin?
justice
stevens
i
have,
i
have
to
interrupt
you.
what
is,
what
is
intellectually
dishonest
by
the
court
of
appeals
saying,
judge
selya
says
he's
looked
at
substantial
performance
cases.
he
thinks
they'd
apply
it
in
this
area
just
like
they
did
others...
the
restatement
applies.
that's
all
we've
got
to
go
on
and
we'll
accept
it.
what's
intellectually
dishonest
about
that?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
what
happened
here.
i'm
talking
about
this
very
opinion.
justice
stevens
judge
selya
said,
i
looked...
i've
looked
at
all
the
substantial
performance
cases
i
can
find.
i
found
two.
they
were
construction
cases,
one
was
a
construction
case
and
one
was
something
else.
i've
read
the
restatement.
i
think...
my
hunch
is
the
rhode
island
court
would
apply
this
law.
now,
there's
nothing
intellectually
dishonest.
if
anything,
he's
overtly
candid.
justice
stevens
they
said
in
view
of
our
rule
of
deference
we'll,
we'll
follow
what
he
had
to
say.
they
had
nothing...
apparently
you
didn't
call
any
rhode
island
law
to
their
attention
that
he
didn't
have.
justice
stevens
oh.
justice
stevens
but
he
didn't--
