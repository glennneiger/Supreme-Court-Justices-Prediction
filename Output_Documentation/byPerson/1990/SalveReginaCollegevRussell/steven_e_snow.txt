mr.
steven
e.
snow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
this
afternoon
on
salve
regina
college's
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
college
contends
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
when
it
failed
to
predict
or
attempt
to
analyze
how
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
would
likely
rule
on
an
unclear
question
of
state
law,
in
this
case
on
which
jurisdiction
was
based
solely
upon
diversity
of
citizenship.
instead
the
court
of
appeals
deferred
to
the
district
court's
largely
unsupported
prognostication
that
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
would
apply
the
commercial
contract
doctrine
of
substantial
performance
in
the
unique
context
of
the
relationship
between
a
college
and
a
student.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
no.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
no,
your
honor,
the
court
did
not
indicate
which
way
they
might
rule
absent
deference.
what
they
did
indicate
was
that
applying
the
traditional
rule
of
deference,
they
said
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
not
reversible
error.
in
other
words,
they
said
the
decisions
of
the
district
court
was
a
permissible
rule
of
law.
they
didn't
necessarily
say
it
was
the
correct
rule
of
law.
after
a
brief
review
of
the
facts,
i
would
like
to
explain
why
we
believe
that
every
litigant
is
entitled
to
a
full,
considered,
and
impartial
review,
that
there
is
no
justification
for
being
less
thorough,
for
curtailing
any
part
of
an
appellant's...
appellate
rights
or
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
abrogate
any
part
of
its
appellate
responsibility
simply
because
the
law
involved
is
state
law
rather
than
federal
law.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
clearly
this
court,
because
of
judicial
economy,
must
defer
to
the
lower
courts
when
it
comes
to
issues
of
local
law.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
that's
correct.
that's
our
position.
the...
this
case
arose
in
a
rather
exotic
factual
context.
the
respondent
matriculated
to
salve
regina
college
as
a
freshman.
during
the
freshman
year
she
applied
to
become
a
candidate
in
the,
in
the
college's
department
of
nursing,
a
candidate
for
a
nursing
degree.
she
began
her
nursing
studies
as
a
sophomore.
right
from
the
first
day
of
her
nursing
studies,
when
the
faculty
was
explaining
to
students
their
expectations
of
students,
the
faculty
privately
advised
the
respondent
that
they
felt
that
she
could
potentially
have
problems
in
the
clinical
portions
of
the
curriculum
in
the
future
which...
the
clinical
portions
would
begin
during
the
junior
year...
because
of
a
medical
condition
that
she
had.
the
respondent
suffered
from
a
rather
severe
addictive
eating
disorder
which
led
to
her
being
morbidly
obese.
she
was
at
the
time
that
she
started
her
nursing
studies
more
than
twice
the
normal
body
weight
for
a
person
of
her
size
and
body
build.
she
was
advised
by
the
faculty
right
from
the
beginning
that
she
had
some
time
to
try
to
address
this
problem
and
they
recommended
that
she
seek
treatment
and
do
what
she
could
to
attempt
to
solve
this
problem
before
she
started
her
clinical
studies
during
her
junior
year.
despite
this
advice
the
respondent
did
not
seek
treatment.
in
fact
her
condition
became
worse
during
the
time
that
she
was
a
student
at
the
college.
as
the
faculty
predicted,
in
fact
her
size
did
become
a
problem
during
the
clinical
training.
this
culminated
in
the
middle
of
her
junior
year
when
her
senior
clinical
instructor
gave
her
what
amounted
to
a
failing
clinical
evaluation,
all
for
reasons
that
in
some
way
or
another
related
to
her
weight.
as
a
result,
and
as
a
result
of
the
college's
longstanding
policy
that
a
failure
in
the
clinical
program
would
mean
dismissal
from
the
program
in
its
entirety,
the
faculty
met
with
the
student
and
they
came
to
an
agreement.
because
this
was
an
unusual
situation
where
the
student's
failure
seemed
to
be
related
to
her
weight,
the
college
agreed
that
they
would
enter
into
a
formal
agreement
with
the
student
under
which
the
student
was
allowed
to
continue
in
the
program
on
a
probationary
basis
provided
that
she
met
certain
requirements
and
the
requirements
were
that
she
enter
into
a
treatment
program
and
that
she
lose
a
certain
amount
of
weight
prior
to
entering
the
senior
year
clinical
aspects
of
the
curriculum.
the
record
below
reflects
that
although
the
student
began
complying
with
the
terms
of
this
agreement,
after
a
short
period
of
time,
in
fact,
her
compliance
stopped
and
the
end
result
was
that
just
prior
to
the
beginning
of
her
senior
it
was
very
clear
that
not
only
did
she
not
meet
the
terms
of
the
agreement,
she
didn't
come
close
to
meeting
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
at
that
point
she
was
told
that
she
could
not
enter
the
senior
year
clinical
aspects
of
the
program.
the
respondent
responded
in
two
ways.
first,
she
transferred
to
another
institution
and
sought
medical
and
psychological
treatment
which
culminated
in
her
undergoing
a
rather
radical
surgical
procedure
which
led
to
her
losing
some
50
percent
of
her
overweightness,
after
which
she
did
graduate
and
today
is
a
nurse.
she
also
responded
by
filing
a
lawsuit
against
salve
regina
on
a
wide
variety
of
federal
and
state
law
claims,
ranging
from
handicapped
discrimination
and
alleged
due
process
violations
to
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
all
of
these
claims,
save
and
except
a
simple
state
law
breach
of
contract
claim,
were
dismissed
either
on
summary
judgment
or
were
directed
out
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case
in
chief.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
first
circuit
applied
this
rule
of
deference,
what
it
called
a
traditional
rule
of
deference.
this
rule
that
the
circuit
applied
is
an
important
rule.
it's
important
because
it's
applied
to
all
diversity
cases,
which
make
up
some
20
to
25
percent
of
the
docket
of
the
federal
district
courts,
some
15
percent
of
the
docket
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
it
applies
to
other
cases
as
well.
it
applies
to
a
whole
variety
of
cases
in
which
state
law
serves
as
the
rule
of
decision
for
one
reason
or
another.
it's
also
important
because--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--to
some
extent
it
would
apply
in
a
bankruptcy
case
where
there's
a
question
of
property
rights
that's
determined
by
state
law.
it
would
apply
in
a
wide
variety
of
contexts.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
i
don't
recall
seeing
any
particular
case
that
relates
to
bankruptcy
judges.
of
course,
one
could
make
an
argument
that
this
is--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--well,
i
think
you
could
make
an...
you
could
probably
analogize
a
bankruptcy
court
somewhat
more
to
an
administrative
agency
which,
which
at
least
theoretically
has
a
special
expertise
in
that
narrow
area.
that's
not
true
when
we're
talking
about
state
law
in
general.
we
believe
that
the
rule
of
deference
not
only
is
important
but
that
it's
ill-conceived.
in
fact,
it's
really
an
exception
to
the
historic
approach
taken
by
this
court
in
which
questions
of
law
are
reviewed
de
novo
and
questions
of
fact
are
reviewed
for
clear
error.
and
questions
that
are,
are
subject
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
court
are
reviewed
for
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
i
would
agree,
justice
o'connor,
that
it
is
true
that
the
majority
of
courts
of
appeals
have
applied
this
rule
of
deference.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
however,
when
they've
done
so...
and...
the
rule
of
deference
started
shortly
after
the
erie
case
was
decided
in
1938.
i
think
it
was
first
announced
by
the
eighth
circuit.
there's
never
been
any
court
of
appeals
that
has
given
a
considered
analysis
of
why
the
rule
of
deference
is
applied.
rather,
their
citation
to
authority
of
this
court
which
i
would
suggest
is
inappropriate,
since
this
court
is
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
designed
to
handle
cases
of--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
what
the
rule
is
based
on,
but
i
would
submit
that
that's
not
a
very
sound
rationale.
while
it
is
true
that
a
district
court
judge
may
have
some
heightened
familiarity
with
some
aspects
of
state
law,
i
would
suggest
that
state
law
today
is
so
complex
that
it's
unreasonable
to
assume
that
any
district
judge
or
any
practitioner
has
a
meaningful
level
of
expertise
in
all
areas
of
state
law
that
would
outweigh
the
tremendous
advantages
i
suggest
that
a
court
of
appeals
has
in
deciding
questions
of
law.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
well,
of
course,
i'm...
we're
not
suggesting
deciding
it
necessarily
as
an
original
matter.
what
we're
suggesting
is
is
that
they
would
review
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
not
give
it
any
particular
deference,
but
certainly
the
district
court's
decision
ought
to
be
considered.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
we
believe
not.
we
believe
it
ought
to
be
the
same.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
no
deference
at
all
to
a
district
court's
decision.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
well,
if
it's
a
tie,
then
i...
it
would
be
the
same
rule,
i
believe,
if
it
was
a
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
well,
i
suppose
if
it's
a
tie,
one,
one
possibility
would
be
to
certify
the
question
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
where
you
could
get
a
definitive
ruling
of
state
law.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
yes,
there
is.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
the
court
of
appeals
would
defer
to
the
district
court
judge
who
was
sitting
on
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
steven
e.
snow
i
agree.
that
would
make
no
sense.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
i
would
suggest
that
not
only
is--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--most
district
judges
are.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
of
course,
not
all
of
them
necessarily
practice
law
in
that
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
there
are
district
judges
who
came
up
from
the
ranks
of
u.s.
attorneys--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--most
of
them
did.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
but
the
question
is--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--that,
that
is
also
true.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
furthermore,
the
question
is
even
if
you
practice
law
in
that
area...
i
practiced
law
in
rhode
island
for
15
years
and
i
feel
that
i
have
a
certain
amount
of
familiarity
with
some
aspects
of
state
law.
but
compared
with
the
advantages
that
a
court
of
appeals
has
with
respect
to
having
a
multijudge
panel
reviewing
the
case;
you
have
the
parties
fully
briefing
the
issues
that
the
district
court
does
not
have;
there
is
the
luxury
of
time
to
some
extent,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
the
court
of
appeals
aren't
very
busy.
but
compared
to
what
a
district
judge
has
to
accomplish,
since
the
district
judge's
job
is
primarily
conducting
trials
and
receiving
evidence
and
deciding
factual
issues--
--well,
just
on
that
very
point,
you
had
mentioned
earlier
certification
and
here
when
judge
selya
had
to
explain
why
he
was
going
to
let
this
issue
go
to
the
jury,
he
made
a
long
explanation
of
what
he
was
going
to
do,
did
you
ask
to
have
the
question
certified
then
and
would
you
propose
that
the
district
judge
should
interrupt
the
trial
to
certify
the
question?
mr.
steven
e.
snow
we
did
not
ask
the
district
judge
to
certify
the
question
at
that
time.
in
fact,
the
question
came
up
only
at
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
i
think
it
would
not
have
been
prudent
in
the
context
of
a
jury
trial
at
that
time;
however,
i
think
it
might
have
been
prudent
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
certified
the
question
to
the
rhode
island
district
court.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
i
think
if
the
issue
had
come
up
pretrial,
then
it
very
well
could
have
been
certified
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
way
the
issue
came
up...
neither
of
the
parties
raised
this
issue
of
substantial
performance.
it
came
up
during
argument
on
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
and
the
court
raised
it
sui
sponte,
suggesting
that
the
trial
judge
had
been
a
state
court
judge
for
a
period
of
time
and
he
stated
that
he
felt
that
he
had
some
intuitive
feeling
for
how
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
might
handle
that
issue
and
decided
it
at
that
time.
the
parties
really
did
not
have
much
of
a
chance
to
research
the
issue
thoroughly
during
the
heat
of
trial,
and
frankly
the
court
didn't
have
much
of
a
chance
to
consider
the
issue
thoroughly.
in
contrast
to
a
court
of
appeals
who,
after
full
briefing,
could
have
the
luxury
of
considering
the...
that
focused
legal
issue.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
yes,
he
did.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
and
we
did...
and
we
did
present
the
district
court
with
the
findings
of
our
research,
which
was
to
the
effect
that
no...
we
could
no
court
anywhere
in
the
country,
let
alone
rhode
island,
that
applied
the
commercial
contract
doctrine
of
substantial
performance
to
the
academic
relationship
between
the
student
and
the
college.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
take
that
approach,
we've
come
full
circle
with
the
erie
doctrine,
we're
back
to
swift
v.
tyson.
we're
looking...
as
the
respondent
states
in
his
brief...
we're
engaged
in
fourth-dimensional
reasoning
to
some
transcendent
principles
of
truth
and
justice.
that
sounds
very
much
like
a
brooding
omnipresence
of
general
law
hanging
over
the
united
states.
i
think
the
essence
of
the
erie
doctrine
is
that
the
law
is
determinable,
state
law
is
determinable
and
can
be
communicated
by
lawyers
to
judges,
federal
judges
no
less
than
state
judges,
and
appellate
judges
no
less
than
district
judges.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
even
though
those
appellate
judges
were
not
from
the
state,
but--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--that
is
true.
we
did
not
have
any
rhode
island
judges
on
the
appellate--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--i
believe
connecticut.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
no,
he's
on
the
second
circuit.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
he's
on
the
second
circuit.
that's
correct.
in
comparison
with
the
district
court,
the
main
job
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
deciding
law
expertly,
which
leads
to
our
conclusion
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
district
court
judge
may
have
some
heightened
familiarity
in
general
with
state
law
is
insignificant
compared
to
the
many
institutional
advantages
that
the
court
of
appeals
has.
the--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--well,
i'm
not
suggesting
you
pay
no
attention
to
the
district
court's
opinion.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between,
between
paying
attention
to
the
district
court's
view
and
reviewing
what
the
district
court
said.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
there's
a
difference
between
giving
it
deference--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--i
think
you'd
give
that
the
weight
that
it
would
appear
to
deserve
in
the
context
of
that
particular
case,
but
you
do
not
decide
in
advance
that
you're
going
to
give
it
any
particular
weight.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
certainly.
i...
certainly,
i
think,
you
know,
in
this
court
in
the
commissioner
v.
bosch
case
said
that
when
there
is
no
ruling
by
the
highest
court
of
a
state,
then
you
can
look
at
a
wide
variety
of
materials.
you
can
look
at
decisions
from
other
courts.
you
can
look
at--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--i
would
suggest
that
you
do
not
give
any
special
particular
weight
to
that.
that
if
there
is
any
special
insight
that
that
district
court
judge
has
in
the
way
in
which
the
state
supreme
court
might
rule,
then
the
district
court
judge
can
put
that
into
the
opinion
and
that
can
be
reviewed
and
argued
as
any
other
facet
of
the
case
would
be,
just
as
if
the
district
court
judge
had
some
special
insight
in
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
the
court
of
appeals
can
certainly
agree
with
him--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--well,
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable.
i
think
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
agrees
with
the
district
court's
rationale,
then
of
course
they're
going
to
affirm.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
well,
we're
suggesting
that
the
rule
ought
to
be
a
de
novo
review.
i--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--that
would
appear
to
be
the
case
now.
it
does
appear
at
least
in
the
first
circuit
that
they
only
defer
to
a
district
court
judge.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
we're
suggesting
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
review
de
novo.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
we
believe
that
it's
inappropriate--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--well,
we...
i
would
suggest,
justice
marshall--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--no,
i
don't
think
ignore
is
the,
is
the
correct
word.
i
think
that
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
they
should
not
give
any
special
deference
to
a
district
court
judge.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
district
court
judge
comes
forth
with
a
rationale
that
makes
sense
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
agrees
with
and
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
affirm.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
that's
right.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
yes.
and
i...
that's
what
we're
suggesting,
that
if
the...
that
it's
the
reasoning
that's
important,
not
the
judge's
biography.
we
think
it's
a--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--i
wouldn't
treat
it
any--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--i
would
assume
that,
that
he
probably
does,
but
i
think
it's
a
dangerous
practice
for
the
courts
of
appeals
to
get
into
what
is
essentially
judge
rate;
that
we're
going
to
defer
to
judge
x
because
he
has
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
this
area,
but
we're
not
going
to
defer
to
judge
y
because
he
has
less
experience.
maybe
that's
why
he
just
went
on
the
bench.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
well,
i
would
hope
that
our
system
of
justice
would
at
least
strive
for
a
certain
degree
of
intellectual
honesty
and
if...
and
i
don't
think
the
rule
of
deference...
in
fact
it
is
only
used--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
giving
any
deference.
that's
sounds
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
happens
to
be
agreeing.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
well,
in
this
very
opinion--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--well,
that's
just...
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
engage
in
that
type
of
analysis
at
all.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
well,
well,
i
hope
that
we
did,
but--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--but
i
would
agree
that
you
could
not
tell
that
from
the
opinion.
all,
all
we
know
from
the
opinion
is
that
they
deferred
to
the
district
court.
but
i
think
there's
a
very
important
thing
that
the
opinion
does
say.
they
don't
say
that...
and
it
was
judge
lagueux...
judge
selya
handled
the
case
who
is
now
in
the
first
circuit.
he
handled
the
case
at
the
summary
judgment
level.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
he,
he
did
not
handle
the
trial.
it
was
judge
lagueux.
there
are
many
other
negative
effects,
we
contend,
with
respect
to
the
rule
of
deference.
it's
vague
and
uncertain.
it
leads,
therefore,
to
uneven
appellate
review.
we
also
believe
that
the
rule
violates
the
erie
doctrine
to
the
extent
that
a
court
of
appeals
is
in
a
superior
position
to
accurately
predict
what
state
law
is.
then
clearly
erie
is
violated
by
deferring
to
the
district
court's
decision.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
well,
i
suppose
that
that
may
be
true.
i
know--
mr.
steven
e.
snow
--i
know
that
respondent
suggests
that
deference
is
simply
a
judicial
shorthand
when
the
court
does
not
wish
to
write
an
opinion,
but
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
that's
a
degree
of
intellectual
dishonesty.
if
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
is
really
reviewing
the
matter
de
novo
and
is
only
using
the
rule
of
deference
as
a
way
to
avoid
writing
opinions,
we
suggest
that's
not...
that's
not
the
proper,
not
the
proper
rule.
mr.
steven
e.
snow
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
brother
has
suggested
that
there's
no
issue
of
constitutional
law
in
this
case
and
i
respectfully
differ
to
the
extent
that
erie
does
state
a
rule
of
constitutional
law.
i
would
suggest
that
the
cases
of
this
court
interpreting
the
erie
in
fact
mandate
de
novo
review.
in
the
wichita
royalty
case,
decided
only
a
year
after
erie,
this
court
ruled
that
a
court
of
appeals
is
substituted
for
the
state
supreme
court
and
must
therefore
interpret
the
law
the
same
way
as
the
state
supreme
court
would
have
declared
and
applied
it.
i
would
suggest
that
that
implies
that
de
novo
review
is
required.
furthermore,
in
palmer
v.
hoffman,
this
court...
and
other
cases...
this
court
has
ruled
that
state
law
presumptions
and
burdens
of
proof
control
in
a
diversity
case.
i
suggest
that
it's
logical
that
if
presumptions
and
burdens
of
proof
apply
at
the
trial
level
then
they
equally
apply
at
the
appellate
level.
and
in
hanna
v.
plumer
this
court
ruled
that
it's
unfair
under
erie
for
the
character
or
result
to
materially
differ
because
the
suit
was
brought
in
federal
court.
i
would
suggest
that
under
the
rule
of
deference
at
the
very
least
the
character,
if
not
the
result
of
the
case,
does
differ
because
the
case
was
brought
in
federal
court.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions--
