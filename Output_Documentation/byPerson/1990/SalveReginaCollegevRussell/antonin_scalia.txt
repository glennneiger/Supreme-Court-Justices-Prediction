justice
scalia
to
make
sense
is
a
big
part
of
it.
i
mean
comparing
it
to
a
law
review
article
written
by
somebody
is,
is,
you
know...
in
law
review
articles
don't
generally
say,
i
think
the
law
is
this,
because
i'm
from
there.
i
mean
they
usually
give
reasons,
right--
justice
scalia
--and
you
evaluate
what
the
author
has
to
say
on
the
basis
of
the
reason
he
gives.
justice
scalia
careful,
counsel,
cause
several
of
us
have
done
this,
you
know.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
why
can't
they...
if
that's
all
they're
doing,
why
don't
they
say,
we
affirm
for
the
reasons
stated
by
the
district
judge
rather
than
we
affirm
because
the
district
judge
thinks
that's
the
right
answer.
i
mean,
you
know,
those,
those
are
two
quite
different
formulations.
justice
scalia
i
suppose
you
could
say
the
same
thing
in
federal
questions,
that
the
court
of
appeals...
who
knows...
that
they
go
through
all
of
that
labor
and
the
very
next
day
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
may,
may
make
it
a
dead
letter,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
so
is
that
the
distinction?
it's
only
us--
justice
scalia
--versus
only
the
texas
supreme
court?
justice
scalia
i
mean
the
point
is
the
same.
it
doesn't...
any
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
not
forever.
there's
somebody
who
can
overturn
it.
justice
scalia
i
mean
it's
not
worth
doing.
justice
scalia
well,
why
don't
we
just
make
up
a
rule
that
they
don't
have
to
write
an
opinion
on
matters
of
state
law
instead
of
making
up
a
rule
that
they
don't
have
to
consider
it.
i
mean,
you
know,
if,
if
it's
just
a
timesaving
thing,
wouldn't,
wouldn't
that
be
a
better
rule
to
make
up?
justice
scalia
well,
my
point
is
i
assume
an
appellate
court
is
supposed
to
review
the,
the
issues
of
law
that
are,
that
are
there
in
the
case,
but
you're
saying
for
this
one
issue
of
law,
because
it
is
so
time-consuming,
they
don't
have
to
review
this
issue
of
law.
they
just
say,
well,
you
know,
if
the
district
judge
knows
and
it
seems
reasonable
and
may
be
wrong,
but--
justice
scalia
by
the
same
court,
by
the
same
court,
right?
both
deferred
to
by
the
same
court?
justice
scalia
and
yet
they
are
only
doing
what
you
say
and
that
is
just
saving
themselves
the
problem
of
writing
an
opinion.
justice
scalia
even
though
they
come
out
different
ways
in
both
cases.
i
mean
surely
they
must
be
doing
something
more
than
saving
themselves
the
trouble
of
writing
an
opinion
after
they
thoroughly
or
adequately
considered
the
matter.
justice
scalia
i
mean
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
either
you
think
that
they're
really
examining
the
matter
and
this
word
deference
really
doesn't
mean
anything
or
you
think
it
does
mean
something,
in
which
case
you
can
reach
different
results
that
way.
justice
scalia
well,
which
is
it?
which
is
it?
correct
or
reasonable?
which
of
the
two?
you
can
be
reasonable
and
be
wrong.
these
are
justice
marshall's
questions,
i
think.
