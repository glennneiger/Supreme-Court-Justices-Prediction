justice
white
well,
did
the
court
say
what
its
view
would
have
been
absent
deference?
justice
white
did
it
say
if
we
weren't,
if
we
weren't
giving
deference,
here's
what
we
think
the
law
means?
justice
white
do
you
think
there's
any...
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
we
had
done
the
same
thing?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
are
bound
independently
to
interpret
state
statutes
in,
in
diversity
cases?
justice
white
well,
what
if
it's
a
tie?
justice
white
well,
does
it
go...
what
do
you
do,
decide
it
yourself
or
do
you
flip
a
coin?
or
do
you
get
deferred
to
the
district
judge?
justice
white
would
you
give
it
as
much
deference
as
you
would
in
a
law
general
article
written
by
a
professor
of
a
law
school
in
that
state
who
has
been
studying
the
thing
for
20
years?
justice
white
well,
say,
say
the
courts...
the
intermediate
courts
of
appeals
in
the
state
are
split
on
the
same
subject...
on
the
same
matter.
it's
just
never
been
gotten
up
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
law
professors
debate
it
and
judge,
a
district
judge
has
to
decide
it,
has
to
decide
what
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
is
going
to
do.
should
you
give
him
any
weight
at
all?
justice
white
but
what
if
you
say...
you
read...
the
court
of
appeals
reads
law
professors'
articles,
they
read
the
opinions
of
the...
of
the
courts
of
appeals
on
the
split,
then
they
read
the
district
judge.
can
they
say,
well,
his
position
seems
like
a
very
reasonable
one?
that's
the
end
of
it.
can't
they
just
say
that?
justice
white
yeah,
but
you
don't
agree...
well,
they
say,
we
agree
with
him
enough
to
say
that
it
sounds
reasonable,
what
he's
saying
sounds
reasonable.
justice
white
and
sometimes
write
a
long-winded
opinion.
justice
white
i
take
it
in
your
state
the
court
of
appeals
in
diversity
cases
must
not
defer
so
much
to
district
judges
that
lawyers
think
there's
no
use
appealing
a
district
judge's
ruling.
justice
white
i
mean
if
they...
if,
if
there
was,
if
there
was
too
much
deference
to
a
district
judge,
you'd
be
wasting
your
money
appealing
a
legal
question.
justice
white
i
take
it
that's
not
the
case
in
your
circuit?
justice
white
well,
i
know
but,
but
you
don't
need
to
look
at
the
universal
district
of
the
whole
circuit.
how
about
lawyers
practicing
in
rhode
island?
do
they
feel
that
it's
useless
to
appeal
a
question
of
law
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
but
you
think
that
despite
this
maybe
weak,
weak
or
strong
presumption,
you
think
you
could
justify
spending
your
client's
money
appealing
a,
a
question
of
law
to
the
circuit
court?
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
what
about,
what
about,
what
if
a,
what
if
the
court
of
appeals'
panel
sits
there
and
they
all
agree
that,
that
if,
if
we
were
deciding
this
in
the
first
instance,
we
would
think
the
laws...
the
state
statute
should
be
construed
in
this
manner,
but
the
construction
the
district
judge
has
given
it
is
also
a
reasonable
construction.
but
we
would
prefer
the
others
in
the
original
matter,
but
we
think
we'll
just
think
the...
take
the
view
of
the
district
judge.
now,
is,
is
that
proper
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
or
not?
justice
white
so
that's...
is
that
sort
of
like
deferring...
a
federal
court
deferring
to
an
administrative
agency's
view
of
a
statute?
justice
white
well,--
justice
white
--you
say
until
a
certain
point
if
the,
if
the...
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
they
had
the
better
view
of
the
statute,
if
the
district
judge's
view
was
within
the
realm
of
reasonableness,
they
would
defer
to
him?
justice
white
on
a
diversity
case.
now,
you
say
up
until
a
certain
point,
until
the
ninth
circuit
decided--
justice
white
--what
is
that
citation
you
have
there?
justice
white
i'll
look,
i'll
look
in
your
brief.
justice
white
mr.
hogan,
why
should
there,
why
should
there
be
just
one
rule
among
the
circuits
other
than
a
rule
that
a
circuit
court
shouldn't
just
automatically
rubber
stamp
what
the
district
judge
says?
why
shouldn't
one
circuit
be
able
to
do...
to
give,
to
give
the
normal
deference
as
you
would
say
and,
and
the
ninth
circuit
follow
its
own
rule?
justice
white
uh--
justice
white
--the
first
circuit--
justice
white
--the
first
circuit
may
know
about
its
district
judges.
the
ninth
circuit
may
know
more
about
theirs.
