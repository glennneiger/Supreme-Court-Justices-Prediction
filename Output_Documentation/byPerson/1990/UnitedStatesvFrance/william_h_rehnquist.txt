chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-1363,
united
states
against
darlina
france.
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
levine,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
sorry.
mr.
levine.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
authority
for
that
very...
rather
general
and
ambitious
statement,
mr.
levine,
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
that
the
criminal
justice
system
is
being
presided
over
by
an
article
iii
judge?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
was
asking
you
what
case,
not
what
argument.
chief
justice
rehnquist
those...
those
are,
as
i
understood
them,
first
amendment
cases.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it...
this
partakes
of
nothing
of
the
first
amendment,
so
far
as
i
can
tell.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
a...
a
right?
you
mean
in
a
constitutional
sense?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
any
federal
judge
who
sits
by
designation
in
the
country
has
to
have
my
assignment
to
do
so,
the
assignment
of
the
chief
justice.
and
take
for
example
a
judge
who
is
sitting
in
the
central
district
of
california
by...
by
assignment,
only
by
mistake
the
assignment
says
the
southern
district
of
california.
nobody
has
noticed
that.
he
should
be
in
san
diego;
he
is
in
los
angeles.
now
is
that
an
article
iii
structural
violation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
really
that
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
need
a
futility
exception
to
reach
this
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
jurisdiction
to
preside,
do
you
mean
anything
more
than
congress
had
not
authorized
the
magistrate
to
preside
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
maybe
you
should
use
a
different
phrase.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
there
had
been
no
ninth
circuit
precedent
at
all
on
this
point,
but
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court
of
hawaii
had
made
it
very
clear
in
earlier
cases
that
you
had
tried
that
this
was
his
view
of
the
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
can't
rely
on
a
ruling
of
the
district
judge?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
have...
but
you
can
rely
on
the
court
of
appeals,
even
though
you
could
have
brought
the
case
further
and
brought
it
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
did
finally
grant
certiorari
in
gomez.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
levine.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
bryson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
no.
89-1363
united
states
versus
darlina
k.
france.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
justice
souter
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
