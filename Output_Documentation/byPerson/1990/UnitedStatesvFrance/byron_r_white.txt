justice
white
plain
and
harmless
error?
justice
white
did
i
read
your
brief
right?
did
you
say
that
if
it's
plain
error,
the
same
error
would
be
plain
in
every
case
where
it
happened?
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
about
the
only
time
anybody
has
ever
called
an
error
plain
is
when
they
reverse
something,
isn't
it?
justice
white
if
there
had
been
an
objection,
then
the
judge
might
have
picked
the
jury
himself.
justice
white
well,
by
the
time
he
got
back
they'd
be
finished
with
the
case.
justice
white
let's
assume
that...
let's
assume
that
there
was
an
express
waiver,
and
that
the
waiver
would
not
be
subject
to
your
structural
argument.
there
is
an
express
waiver
that
says
i
want
the
magistrate
to
do
it.
now,
can
the
court
of
appeals
then
on
appeal
say,
take
the
issue
up?
justice
white
that's,
you
say
that...
yeah,
but
then
you
are
arguing
plain
error.
justice
white
well,
suppose
gomez
had
never
been
decided,
but
the
issue
came
up?
or
there
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
waiver
and
the
magistrate
picked
the
jury,
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
think
that
is
contrary
to
the
statute.
could
they
do
that?
justice
white
suppose
gomez
had
never
been
decided.
justice
white
and...
but
there
was
a
waiver
of--
justice
white
--an
express
waiver
says
let's
go
ahead
with
the
magistrate.
and
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
own
motion
says
this
is
contrary
to
the
statute.
justice
white
but
you
have
to
get
to--
--you're
saying
we
don't...
we
don't
need
any
futility
doctrine.
we
don't
need
any
doctrine
at
all.
the
court
of
appeals
can
reach
whatever
it
wants
to
reach.
rule
51
then
really
doesn't
limit
a
court
of
appeals
in
any
way.
justice
white
--but
that
is
plain
error.
you're
really
now
arguing
plain
error.
justice
white
mr.
levine,
rule
51(b)
says
that,
it
is
headed
up
"plain
error.
"
"plain
errors
or
defects
affecting
substantial
rights
may
be
noticed,
although
not
called
to
the
attention.
"
justice
white
now
i
suppose...
are
the,
do
you
think
plain
error
and
defects
affecting
substantial
rights
are
the
same
thing,
or
is
plain
error
different
from--
justice
white
--so
you
say
at
least
this
error
affected
substantial
rights?
justice
white
which
gomez
would...
would
prove,
i
gather?
justice
white
it
became
obvious.
