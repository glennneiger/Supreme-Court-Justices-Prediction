justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question?
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
the
terms.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
an
error
could
be
plain
but
nevertheless
be
harmless.
justice
stevens
because
the
rule
doesn't
talk
about
what's
plain.
it
just
talks
about
when
it
justifies
reversal.
justice
stevens
but
who
cares.
justice
stevens
you
think
every
plain
error
is
reversible
error?
that
is
what
you
are
saying?
justice
stevens
every
plain
error
is--
justice
stevens
--you
don't
think
it's
saying
in
order
to
establish
a
plain
error
justifying
reversal?
justice
stevens
and
plain
being
something
other
than
obvious.
justice
stevens
it
is
both
obvious
and
reversible.
justice
stevens
what
it
boils
down
to
is
you
read
rule
52(b)
to
say
plain
errors
or
defects
must
be
noticed.
if
you
find
it's
plain,
within
the
meaning
you
now
give
the
word
plain,
then
you
have
to
reverse.
so
may
means
must
in
the
rules.
justice
stevens
--but
mr.
levine,
say
the
function
of
drafting
jury
instructions
was
delegated
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
first
instance
to
the
lay...
two
citizens
who
are
the
lawyers
for
the
respective
parties.
they
can
agree
on
a
set
of
instructions,
and
the
judge
never
looks
at
them.
has
that
been
a
fundamental
error...
he
just
gives
the
instructions
the
parties
agree
are
appropriate
for
the
case.
justice
stevens
done
entirely
by
this
panel
of
two
citizens.
justice
stevens
but
here
in
our
case
the
two
citizens
that
are
involved
are
the
lawyers
for
the
parties,
plus
a
magistrate
who
is
not
a
total
stranger
to
the
process.
justice
stevens
by
the
judge.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
another
argument
they
make,
that...
especially
when
you
got
a
new
judge
you
haven't
tried
cases
before,
and
you
know
the
magistrate.
you
might
think
well,
we
know
we
can
ask
questions
x,
y,
and
z
of
the
magistrate.
we're
not
sure
we
could
ask
those
with
the
district
judge,
so
i
think
we'd
rather
go
with
the
magistrate.
we'll
just
keep
our
mouth
shut
and
we
won't
object.
how...
your
rule
really
allows
that
kind
of
what
we
sometimes
refer
to
as
sandbagging.
justice
stevens
you
do
know
there's
a
difference,
because
most
cases
of
plain
error,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
when
you
look
at
the
matter
later.
maybe
the
lawyer
didn't
realize
he
had
a
valid
legal
objection,
but
it's
pretty
clear
that
what
he
failed
to
object
to
was
harmful
to
his
client.
justice
stevens
which
isn't
necessarily
true
in
this
scenario.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
justice
stevens
had
the
visiting
judge
arrived
the
preceding
friday?
justice
stevens
then
we
really
don't
know
whether
she
could
have
done
that.
