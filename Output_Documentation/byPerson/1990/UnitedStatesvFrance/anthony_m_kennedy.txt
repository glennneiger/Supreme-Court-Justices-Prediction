justice
kennedy
and
in
order
to
reach
that
question
do
we
have
to
reach
the
article
iii
question?
justice
kennedy
counsel,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
what
judge
kalaherst's
practice
was
in
his
own
district
in
delegating
the
selection
of
the
jury?
justice
kennedy
because
he
was
a
visiting
judge,
and
it
might...
it's
perfectly
plausible
that
if
there
had
been
an
objection
he
would
have
instructed
the...
selected
the
jury.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
there
could
be
an
objection
at
that
time.
justice
kennedy
so
on
this
point
you
think
what
is
futile
in
the
ninth
circuit
might
not
be
futile
in
the
fifth?
