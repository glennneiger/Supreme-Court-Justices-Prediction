justice
o'connor
what
if
the
error
was
that
the
dispute
was
not...
did
not
comply
with
article
iii
requirements?
it
was
the
jury
was
selected
by
somebody
who
didn't
meet
article
iii
requirements.
could
that
rise
to
the
level
of
plain
error,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
is
that
true
even
where
gomez
makes
clear
that
congress
has
not
authorized
magistrates
to
carry
out
this
function?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
question
then
becomes
whether
it
is
plain
error
under
these
circumstances,
when
it
is
not
an
article
iii
judge
and
congress
has
not
authorized
it.
justice
o'connor
what
case
comes
closest
to
resolving
the
issue
in
this
case?
which
of
our
cases?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
of
course
in
schor
congress
authorized
the
scheme.
justice
o'connor
that
certainly
doesn't
exempt--
