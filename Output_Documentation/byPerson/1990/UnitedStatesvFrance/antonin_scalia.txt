justice
scalia
mr.
bryson,
just
to...
just
to
round
out
what
your
view
of
the
plain
error
rule
is,
what
if
it
produces
a
miscarriage
of
justice
but
is
not...
but
is
not
obvious?
once
you
know
what
the
law
is,
it
is
clear
that
not
applying
that
rule
has
produced
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
nonetheless,
the
rule
itself
is
a
fairly
nice
point.
justice
scalia
mr.
levine,
may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question?
justice
scalia
you
say
we
start
from
the
proposition
that
that's
error,
and
the
question
is
whether
it
is
waived
or
so
forth.
justice
scalia
is
it
not
at
least
theoretically
conceivable
that
one
could
say
that
if
the
parties
both
consent
to
the
use
of
a
magistrate
for
the
purpose
of
picking
the
jury,
for
conducting
the
voir
dire,
that
it's
not
error
at
all?
justice
scalia
well,
assume
that
the...
assume
that
one
treats
the
absence
of
an
objection
as
the
equivalent
of
consent,
at
least
hypothetically.
justice
scalia
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
scalia
does
that
mean
if,
for
example
in
a
felony
trial,
the
judge
has
a
lot
of
confidence
in
two
lawyers
with
experience
such
as
yourself
and
an
adversary
who
is
equally
experienced,
and
the
first
10
questions
are
kind
of
boilerplate,
where
do
you
live,
where
did
you
go
to
school,
are
you
married.
say
there
are
about
20
questions
that
the
parties
agreed
on
the
phraseology
that
will
be
used,
and
they...
the
counsel
are
going
to
ask
those
questions.
could
the
judge,
with
the
stipulation
of
the
parties,
leave
the
room
for
10
minutes
while
those
questions
are
answered
to
take
a
telephone
call
without
jurisdiction
of
the
case
being
lost?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
could
you
tell
us
a
good
reason
why
they
shouldn't,
if
on
direct
review
they
do?
i
reason...
is
there
a
logical
reason
why
the
fact
that
they
thought
the,
it
would
be
futile
to
go
as
high
as
the
state
supreme
court,
although
you
might
go
further
to
u.s.
supreme
court
and
get
it
reversed,
why
should
that
make
a
difference--
justice
scalia
--but
i'm
talking
about
the
futility
doctrine.
justice
scalia
why
shouldn't
the
futility
doctrine,
if
it
applies
in
this
context,
not
apply
as
well
in
habeas
corpus
cases?
justice
scalia
which
we
said
it
doesn't.
justice
scalia
supervisory
power.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
it's
just
as
much
error,
but
is
it
just
as
much
plain?
justice
scalia
one
is
plain
enough
that...
well--
justice
scalia
i
considered
myself
bound
by
d.c.
circuit
precedent
in
byers.
[laughter]
