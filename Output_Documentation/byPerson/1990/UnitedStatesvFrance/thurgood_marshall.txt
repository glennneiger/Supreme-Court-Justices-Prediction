--mr.
bryson,
could
a
magistrate
pick
a
grand
jury?
justice
marshall
is
there
any
end
to
it?
justice
marshall
if
an
objection
is
made
to
a
grand
jury
member,
could
a
magistrate
pass
on
it?
justice
marshall
no,
sir.
somebody,
a
defendant
in
a
case,
objects
to
a
member
of
the
grand
jury,
saying
that
he
was
insane.
justice
marshall
well,
as
of
right
now
in
your
experience,
how
many
cases
do
you
know
of
where
somebody
has
objected
to
a
magistrate
picking
the
jury?
has
it
ever
been
done?
justice
marshall
before?
justice
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case?
justice
marshall
the
formality
of
saying
i
object.
justice
marshall
xxx.
justice
marshall
xxx
did
gomez
object?
justice
marshall
xxx
case.
justice
marshall
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
to
win.
justice
marshall
--is
there
anything
in
article
iii
history
that
suggests
delegation?
justice
marshall
when
did
we
first
have
delegation?
justice
marshall
it's
the
last
decade,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
i
would
think
that
article
iii
was
just
the
opposite.
justice
marshall
you
know
one
point
you
haven't
touched,
i
don't
think,
if
the
magistrate
committed
error
you
could
go
to
the
judge
then
and
there
and
get
it
corrected.
is
that
right?
justice
marshall
no,
no.
i
didn't
put
theoretically
in
there.
wasn't
the
judge
there?
justice
marshall
was
he
available?
justice
marshall
well,
how
are
you
injured
by
that?
justice
marshall
it's
about
5
minutes,
that's
all.
justice
marshall
all
you
have
is
gomez?
justice
marshall
and
you
say
that
is
enough.
