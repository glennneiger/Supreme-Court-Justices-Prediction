mr.
michael
r.
levine
it's
levine,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
that's
all
right,
your
honor.
it
depends
on
your
level
of
income,
you
change
the
pronunciation.
[laughter]
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
question
that
error
occurred
here.
a
magistrate
did
what
congress
had
not
authorized
him
to
do.
the
issue
is,
as
explained
by
the
government,
whether
the
error
is
waived
or
forfeited.
the
court
of
appeals
have
found
that
it
was
not,
and
its
results
should
be
affirmed
on
essentially
three
grounds.
first,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
objection
would
have
been
futile.
second,
in
any
event
the
error
was
plain.
and
third,
whether
constitutional
or
not,
the
error
is
sufficiently
fundamental
that
it
could
be
waived,
if
at
all,
only
by
informed
consent
of
the
defendant,
which
is
utterly
lacking
in
the
case--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
of
course
that
didn't
happen
here.
there
was
no
consent.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
that
jumps
right
to
the
constitutional
question.
and
in
my
view,
and
i
have
taken
the
position
which
i
don't
think
this
court
has
to
reach,
but
i
have
taken
the
position
that
even
with
consent--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--it
would
be
unconstitutional,
because
it
is
an
article
iii
structural
right,
which
as
justice
o'connor
intimated
in
schor,
is
a
structural
right
that
cannot
be
waived.
it's...
you
cannot
agree
to
have
a
trial
before
a
mob
or
a
panel
of
citizens.
you
cannot
agree
to
plead
guilty
to
a
charge
that
has
never
been
charged.
there
are
just
some
things
you
can't
agree
to,
even
if
you
want
to.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
for
10
minutes
to
answer
a
phone
call,
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
say
that
there
was
a
structural
violation.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
that's
another
question.
if
you
have
had
instructions
that
were
read
to
the
jury,
if
they
were
told,
as
they
were
in
this
case
by
the
magistrate
about
the
presumption
of
innocence,
about
reasonable
doubt,
if
they
were
told
about
the
need
to
put
aside
their
prejudices,
yes,
i
would
say
there
would
be
a
structural
violation.
these,
as
the
court
said
in
gomez,
the
atmosphere
of
the
voir
dire
permeates
the
whole
trial.
if
the
voir
dire
is
bad,
if
the
jury
instructions
are
bad
at
the
inception,
the
trial
is
a
charade.
if
by
some
mistake
there
is
a
prejudiced
juror
who
got
on
the
jury
because
he
took
less
seriously
the
magistrate's
questions
than
he
would
have
coming
from
an
article
iii
judge,
then
that
trial
is...
is
void,
yes.
it's
an
article
iii
violation
in
my
judgement
that
is
not
waivable
because
it
goes
beyond
the
defendant's
power.
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
that
the
criminal
justice
system
is
being
presided
over
by
the
most
incorruptible
and
absolutely--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
as
i
say,
i
hope
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
it
is
not
a
waivable
right,
but
my
argument
for
that
is
this.
the
framers
of
the--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
i
don't
have
a
direct
case,
but
i
have
cases
by
analogy.
i
have,
for
example,
a
case,
in
wheat
v.
united
states
this
court
suggested
that
a
defendant
could
not
waive
his
right
to
conflict-free
counsel
because
it
wasn't
just
his
right
to
conflict-free
counsel
that
was
at
stake,
it
was
the
public's
right
to
know...
it
was
the
court's
independent
right
to
ensure
that
the
ethics
of
the
profession
were
being
carried
on
and
that
the
public
would
have
respect
for
the
profession.
in
richmond
newspapers,
not
in
my
brief,
richmond
newspapers
v.
[inaudible],
this
court
held
that
the
defendant
and
the
prosecution
could
not
agree
to
a
secret
trial,
in
essence,
that
the
public
and
the
press
had
a
right
to
attend
the
trial.
it
was
a
structural
right.
the
defendant
couldn't
waive
it.
that
was
extended
to
voir
dire
in
the
press
enterprise
v.
california.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
true.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no,
it...
that's
true,
but
the
interests
at
stake
are
similar.
what
is
the
interest
at
stake
in
the
first
amendment?
it's
the
right
of
the
people
to
come
into
court
to
see
the
criminal
justice
system.
that
is
the
same
with
article
iii,
it
seems
to
me.
what
is
the
point
of...
one
of
the
grievances
in
the
declaration
of
independence
against
the
king
of
england
was
that
the
judges
were
in
the
king's
pocket.
one
of
the...
one
of
the
purposes
of
setting
up
independent
article
iii
judiciary
was
to
ensure
that
an
incorruptible
and
absolutely
independent
judge
ruled,
and
that,
i
believe,
that
the
public
perceive,
as
they
weren't
perceiving
when
they
were
colonies,
that
the
public
perceive
that
justice
was
being
done.
just
as
the
litigants
come
to
this
court,
win
or
lose,
we
know
that
you
judges
with
life
tenure
are
absolutely
incorruptible,
have
reached
a
totally
fearless
decision,
independent
of
the
government,
independent
of
the
executive,
independent
of
congress.
that
is
why
the
public
abides
by
your
decisions.
darlina
france
had
that
same
right,
and
she
didn't
get
it.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
a
requirement
in
a
constitutional
sense.
article
iii,
in
my
judgment,
requires,
and
again
i
have
no
case
authority
for
this
proposition
except
what
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended,
and
it
is
my
belief
it
is
not
merely
a
right,
it's
a
requirement
that
an
article
iii
judge
sit
at
every
critical
stage
of
a
felony
trial
brought
in
federal
district
court.
without
an
article
iii
judge
you
have
an
incompetent
court,
you
have
no
trial,
you
have
no
judgment.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no.
that's
an
error
in
an
order,
but
there
is
an
article
iii
judge
sitting.
all
she,
all
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
is
an
article
iii
judge.
she
got
the
article
iii
judge.
she
may
have
got
the
wrong
one,
but
she
got
the
article
iii
judge.
turning
to
futility...
again
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issues.
there
is
a
lot
easier
way,
and
i
suggest
a
lot
simpler
way,
to
affirm
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here,
and
that
is
simply
to...
if
i
just
may
go
back
for
one
moment,
the
solicitor
general
suggested
that
there
were
a
lot
of
cases
not
only
on
direct
review
but
on
collateral
review.
the
issue
of
collateral
review
is
an
entirely
separate
matter.
that
has
to
do
with
the
teague
doctrine,
cause,
and
prejudice.
that
is
not
before
this
court.
that
is
a
whole
other
matter.
we
can
win
here,
that
is
ms.
france
can
win
here,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's
going
to
affect
collateral
review.
of
course,
depending
on
how
the
court
rules,
if
the
court
makes
a
constitutional
decision
that
could
have
a
greater
effect,
certainly.
but
even
then
it
is
not
necessarily
true
that
people
on
collateral
review
would
prevail.
returning
to
futility,
the
government
argues
that
federal--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--this
is
just
in
federal...
this
case
is
only
going
to
arise
in
federal
courts,
your
honor.
these
are
only
federal
magistrates,
so
we're
never
going
to
have
the
state
case.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
the
futility
doctrine
is
really
in
federal
court--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--you
have
said
that.
you
have
said
that,
and
i
will
concede
that.
i
am
not
going
to
fight
that
proposition.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
on
direct
review
of
a
federal
conviction,
when
the
ninth
circuit
says
futility,
you
can
have
a
futility
doctrine
on
direct
review
because
that
is
just
one
aspect,
in
my
judgment,
of
a
court's
discretion,
an
appellate
court's
discretion,
to
reach
an
issue
where
there
is
no
objection
below.
now
the
government
says
where
is
that
in
rule
51?
it
isn't
there.
but
the
government
concedes
that
the
novelty
exception
exists.
it
cited
cases
for
that
proposition
and
would
twist
grosso
into
novelty
exception.
but
novelty
is
not
set
forth
in
federal
rule
51,
so
their
argument
defeats
itself.
what
about
28
united
states
code
section
2106?
the
government
has
made
no
mention
of
that
statute,
and
yet
this
court
in
grosso
referred
to
that
statute,
and
that
statute
says
in
essence
that
this
court
and
an
appellate
court,
even
on
its
own
motion
for
that
matter,
presumably,
can
reverse
a
conviction
in
the
interests
of
justice.
the
court
in
grosso
cited
that
statute
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
an
authority
to
reach
an
issue
below
when
it
was
not
raised...
when
it
was
not
raised
below.
the
court,
ninth
circuit,
in
henri
v.
united
states,
1950
case,
this
court
allowed
a...
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
within
its
discretion
in
reaching
an
issue
below,
whether
or
not
the
conversations
should
have
been
suppressed,
even
though
they
weren't...
the
precise
grounds
for
the
objection
wasn't
raised
below.
singleton
v.
wolf,
holds...
or
doesn't
hold...
excuse
me.
there
is
strong
language
in
singleton
v.
wolf
which
says
in
essence
that
the
matter
of
what
issues
are
to
be
taken
up
by
a
court
of
appeals
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
is
not
a
futility
habeas
corpus
doctrine
where
you
have
the
problem
of
trying
to
bypass
the
state
court
system.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
that's
right.
they
didn't
really
need
it,
and
so
the
court
should
have
found
the
result,
because
the
result
is
correct.
they
could
have
reached
this
on
the
basis
of
their
supervisory
powers,
for
example.
this
court
in
thomas
v.
arn...
it
is
not
cited
in
my
brief...
thomas
v.
arn
held
that
courts
of
appeal
have
supervisory
power
to...
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
or
not...
they
have
supervisory
power
to
decide
the
effect
of
a
failure
to
object
to
a
magistrate's
report
and
recommendation.
in
some
circuits,
when
a
magistrate
issues
a
report
and
recommendation,
the
rule
is
if
one
party
doesn't
object
to
that
report
and
recommendation,
the
issue
is
waived
on
appeal.
they
cannot
raise
the
issue
on
appeal.
other
circuits,
such
as
the
ninth,
have
held,
no,
it's
okay.
we
are
not
going
to
institute
that
rule.
and
this
court
in
thomas
v.
arn
essentially
said
that
is
okay.
that
is
within
the
supervisory
power
of
the
courts.
i
might
just
point
out
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
used
its
discretion
to
reach
issues
that
the
government
has
not
raised
below.
i
would...
you
can
imagine
what
those
briefs
say
about
the
courts
of
appeals'
authority
to
reach
issues
when
not
raised
below.
i
bet
they'll
say
something
a
lot
different
from
what
is
in
the
government's
brief
in
this
case.
several
times
the
ninth
circuit...
i
listed
two
cases
in
my
brief,
but
there
are
others...
where
the
ninth
circuit
reaches
issues,
and
other
circuits
do,
too.
this
is...
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
are
there
to
promote
justice,
not
injustice.
and
it
would
have
been
an
injustice
in
this
case
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
tell
me,
mr.
levine,
we
told
you
that
an
objection
was
irrelevant,
was
immaterial,
was
a
waste
of
time.
we
told
you
that
in
bezold.
and
then
for
them
to
come
up
and
for
them
to
have
said
to
me
oh,
you
should
have
objected.
this
time
you
should
have
objected.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i
think
it
could.
it's
within
its
discretion.
as
i
say,
the
court...
a
court
of
appeals
can
reach
an
issue
if
there
is
an
injustice.
i
think
probably
in
that
case,
though--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
i'm
arguing...
first
of
all
i'm
arguing
if
it's
a
structural
error
of
the
magnitude
such
as
i...
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is,
a
court
of
appeals,
even
in
an
express
consent,
is
going
to
say
i'm
sorry,
parties,
you
can't
consent.
it's
a
structural
error,
and
either
it's
plain
error
or
it's
constitutional
error.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
could
i
have
that
question
again?
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
express
waiver.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
the...
the
court
of
appeals
can
do
that.
i
think
a
court
of
appeals
has
inherent
power
in
the
interest
of
justice,
when
it
thinks
that...
it
could
reach
it
on
plain
error.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
no.
i'm
going
to--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--in
the
interests
of
justice,
as
it
was
in
this
case.
it
isn't
just
an
abstract
question
of
reaching
an
issue,
and
i
am
sorry
i
suggested--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
i'll
move
to
plain
error
then.
but...
this
is
plain
error.
it's
plain
error
because
it
fits
the
definition
of
plain
error,
whatever
definition
you
want.
the
first
definition
is
rule
52(b),
which
says
an
error
is
plain
if
it
effects
substantial
rights.
what
more
substantial
right
could
there
be?
this
court
in
gomez
unanimously
said,
in
an
opinion
written
by
justice
stevens,
says
that
a
defendant
has
a
basic
right
to
have
a
person
with
jurisdiction
preside
at
every
critical
stage
of
the
proceedings.
there
was
no
person
with
jurisdiction
to
preside
at
this
trial,
therefore
her--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--i
am
not
sure
what
i
mean
when
jurisdiction
to
preside.
i
have
argued--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--all
right.
well,
this
court
used
jurisdiction.
this
court
used
jurisdiction
in
gomez.
what
i...
i
think
it
could
be
construed
to
say
that
the
court
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
question
of
jury
selection.
and
i'll
use
the
word
authority.
in
gomez
this
court
said
that
the
magistrate
lacked
authority
to
rule
over
the
subject...
over
the
question
of
jury
selection.
but
a
court
that
is
without
authority
is
a
court...
is
not
a
competent
tribunal.
if
the
tribunal
is
not
competent,
the
verdict
cannot
stand.
now
the
government
argues,
yes,
you
just
had,
you
had
an
incompetent
tribunal,
perhaps,
at
the
beginning,
but
you
had
an
article
iii
judge
at
the
end.
now...
but
that
doesn't
save
it,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
your
cases
suggest,
the
cases
suggest
that
you
need
a
competent
tribunal,
at
least
in
a
felony
case,
at
every
critical
stage
of
the
trial,
owing
to,
by
analogy,
ward
v.
monroe
case.
and
in
johnson
v.
zerbst,
justice
brennan
suggests
that
you
can
lose
jurisdiction
once
the
competency
of
the
court
is
gone.
now,
take
the
other
definition
of
plain
error,
the
one
that
the
cases
use,
young
and
frady...
seriously
affect
the
integrity
or
public
reputation
of
the
judicial
proceedings.
this
case
fits
within
that.
integrity
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings
is
harmed
when
the
public
sees
that
a
person
is
presiding
at
a
critical
stage
of
a
felony
trial
when
congress
has
not
authorized
that
person
to
do
so.
here
the
trial
is
supposed
to
be
adjudicating
whether
the
defendant
has
violated
the
laws
against
the
united
states,
when
the
very
judicial
officers
have
in
a
sense
violated
the
laws
against
the
united
states
by
acting
without
authority.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
theoretically,
except
that
this
court
in
gomez--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--the
judge
was
there.
and
i
am
not
arguing--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--he
was
available.
he
was
available.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i
was
injured--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--i
was
injured
in
the
same
way
the
defendant
in
gomez
was
injured.
he
too
did
not
have
any
error
that
he
raised
with
the
district
court.
he
too
had
essentially
no
prejudice.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
that's...
that's
all.
with
respect--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--that's
9
to
0,
very
strong
holding
in
the
united
states
v.
gomez.
i
wish
that
was
all
i
have
in
all
my
other
cases,
your
honor,
because
i'll
be
happy
to
go
with
that.
but
even
apart
from
that,
we
have...
thank
you,
your
honor.
say
i'm
right
and
i'll
sit
down.
[laughter]
the
government
concedes
that
it's
plain
error
to
delegate
to
a
panel
of
citizens
trial
functions.
in
my
judgment
that
disposes
of
this
case.
if
they
concede
that
it's
error
to
delegate
trial
functions
to
a
panel
of
citizens,
i
would
argue
it's
just
as
much
error
to
delegate
trial
functions
to
a
magistrate,
because
both
lack
authority.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i...
i
believe
it
is.
that
is
a
judgment
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
make,
but
i
believe
it
is
because
both
lack
authority.
both
are
incompetent
tribunals.
you
might
as
well
have
the
panel
of
citizens
selecting
the
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
what
is
the
real
distinction?
it
is
only
plain
enough...
all
right,
granted,
the
magistrate
is
used
to
making
judicial
decisions.
but
suppose
you
had
a
series
of
law
professors
pick
the
jury,
or
brilliant
attorneys
pick
the
jury?
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no.
no,
but
they
are
different
citizens.
they
are
authorized--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--yes.
that's
the...
that's
the
rub.
the
difference
is
the
lawyers
are
authorized
to
agree
on
jury
instructions.
that's
their
job.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
not
only
by
the
judge,
by
the
constitution
and
by
the
structure
of
the
system.
the
magistrate
has
not
been
authorized
by
congress
or
by
anybody...
by
congress,
and
that
is
where
he
needed
authorization.
he
may
have
been
authorized
by
the
trial
judge,
but
that
wasn't
sufficient.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i
read
it
as
the
same
thing,
but
i
can't
say.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes.
clearly.
it
affected
the
substantial
right
identified
by
this
court
in
gomez.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes,
exactly.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no,
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor,
in
fact,
and
i
don't
know.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i
beg
to
differ
with
your
honor,
because
first
of
all
magistrates
conduct
the
jury
on
mondays.
the
jury
is
presented
as
a
fait
accompli
on
tuesdays.
the
judge...
that
is
the
first
time
the
judge
typically,
in
hawaii,
always
in
hawaii
when
the
judge
enters
the
arena
the
jury
is
already
there.
they
are
about
to
be
sworn.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
i
submit
that
that
would
be
futile,
given
that
the
policy
is
established
by
the
chief
judge
of
hawaii.
of
course
it
isn't
binding
on...
on
a
visiting
judge,
obviously.
but
to
expect
that
a
visiting
judge
is
going
to
say,
have
a
jury
panel
right
there,
selected,
ready
to
go,
and
there's
going
to
be
an
objection,
and
then
the
judge
says
well,
what
is
the
policy?
oh,
no,
you've
got
ninth
circuit
law.
it's
perfectly
proper.
cert.
denied
twice.
this
is
the
policy
in
the
district
court.
chief
judge
has
said
it.
i
don't
think
a
visiting
judge
is
going
to
do
it,
and
the
government,
most
importantly,
cannot
point
to
a
single
case,
your
honor,
not
a
single
case
after
the
solid
wall
was
erected...
they
couldn't
point
to
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
can't
point
to
it
here,
where
an
objection
to
a
visiting
judge
or
otherwise
caused
the
judge
to
delegate...
to
take
away
the
delegation
to
the
magistrate.
now,
the
akins
case
is
different,
because
the
akins
case
arose...
that
was
also
a
case
that
i
litigated,
but
at
the
time
the
akins
case
was
litigated,
the
solid
wall
was
crumbling
and
crumbling
very
badly.
for
the
first
time
you
had
an
en
banc
circuit
in
ford.
at
the
time
the
akins
trial
took
place,
the
fifth
circuit
in
ford
en
banc
had
said
it
was
error,
albeit
harmless.
that
is
why
i
filed
the
new
objection
in
the
isoemi.
it
came
as
a
stunner.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no,
then
there's
no
excuse.
i
think
you
have
to
raise
the
objection
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
press
it,
in
my
judgment.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
your
honor,
i
asked
this
court
to
grant
certiorari.
this
court
denied
certiorari.
in
january
of
1986,
the
peacock
panel,
justice
kennedy
came
to
the
same
ruling.
certiorari
was
sought
in
that
case.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
but
who...
who...
all
i
am
suggesting
is,
as
justice
scalia
wrote
when
he
was
on
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
byers
case,
could
a
reasonable
attorney
in
essence
have
fought
objection
futile
in
that
case,
when
the
attorney
did
not
object
to
the
admission
of
the
psychiatrist's
testimony.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
at
the
time
of
jury
selection
in
this
case,
and
it
is
a
time
question.
on
april
17th,
1987
a
reasonable
attorney
in
the
district
of
hawaii
could
have
fought
objection
futile.
that's
all
the
ninth
circuit
ruled.
now,
did
he
really
think
it
was
futile?
the
government
gives
us
this
parade
of
horribles
about
subjective.
it's
an
objective
standard.
all
we
are
saying
is
defer
to
the
ninth
circuit's
sound
exercise
of
discretion,
as
this
court
deferred
in
the
henderson
case
to
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation
a
local
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
that's
right.
it's
a
sound
judicial
discretion
determination
to
be
made
by
the
circuit,
and
it
should
be
deferred
to.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
all
right.
that
is
a
very
good
question...
as
are
all
the
questions,
but--
[laughter]
the
question
is
how
do
we
know
that
trial
counsel
in
this
case
did
not
prefer
the
magistrate,
did
not
really
sandbag
here.
and
first
of
all,
i
would
suggest
the
circumstantial
evidence
in
the
record,
that
that's
not
the
case,
because
as
the
court
sees
in
documents,
public
documents
that
i
file,
this
particular
trial
attorney
objected
twice
to
the
same
magistrate
in
the
past.
but
the
real
answer
to
the
question
is
we
don't
really
know.
we
don't
really
know.
but
we
don't
really
know
in
the
case
of
plain
error
when...
what
was
really
going
on--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--plain
error,
that's
a
funny
thing.
you
know,
obviousness
is
20/20
hindsight.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i
mean,
gomez
seems
obvious
now.
but
it
wasn't
so
obvious
to
two
panels
of
the
ninth
circuit,
to
a
ford
panel
in
the
fifth
circuit,
to
rosales
lopez
in
the
second...
to
rivera-sola.
it
wasn't
obvious
to
anybody
until
nine
judges
told
us
it
was
obvious.
then
it
was
very
obvious.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
it
became
obvious.
[laughter]
that...
that's
the
nature
sometimes
of
plain
error.
besides,
even
when
there's...
this...
this
same
argument
would
defeat
the
novelty
exception,
because
you
say
well,
novelty
will
excuse
the
failure
to
object
below.
but
how
do
we
really
know
that
the
attorney
wasn't
pulling
a
fast
one?
it...
it
proves
too
much,
the
argument.
it
destroys
all
power
of
the
court
to
reach
issues.
how
do
we
know,
for
example,
that
in
byers
the
defendant
really
didn't
really
want,
for
some
reason,
the
evidence
from
the
psychiatrist
to
come
in?
you
really
didn't
know
what
was
on...
what
was
going
on
in
his
mind.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
but
that
didn't
say
it
could
have
been
futile,
i
don't
believe.
maybe
it
did.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
thank
you,
your
honors.
