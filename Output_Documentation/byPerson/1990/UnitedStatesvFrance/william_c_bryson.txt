mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
defendant
may
challenge
the
assignment
of
jury
selection
in
a
criminal
case
to
a
magistrate
when
the
defendant
has
not
objected
to
that
procedure
in
the
district
court.
now,
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
of
hawaii,
which
at
the
time
had
a
practice
and
a
local
rule
of
permitting
the
magistrate
to
conduct
jury
selection.
this
was
done
in
a
number
of
districts
around
the
country,
and
was
terminated
abruptly,
of
course,
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
gomez
case
2
years
ago.
this
case
raises
the
question,
of
course,
what
to
do
with
the
many
cases
that
were
either
on
direct
review
or
have
come
up
on
collateral
attack
following
the
gomez
decision,
where
a
magistrate
did
select
a
jury,
and
where
there
was,
in
the
case
of
direct
review
cases,
no
objection
to
the
use
of
the
magistrate.
the
condition
was
for
assault
and
firearms
charges,
and
an
appeal
was
taken
in
which
the
issue
of
the
magistrate's
jury
selection
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
initially.
the
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
this
court
decided
the
gomez
case,
and
the
respondent
promptly
requested
reversal
on
that
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
fact
reverse
on
that
ground
in
response
to
the
government's
principal
submission,
which
was
that
there
had
been
no
objection,
and
therefore
reversal
was
inappropriate.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
so-called
futility
doctrine
applied.
that
is
to
say
that
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
had
previously
upheld
jury
selection
by
magistrates
on
both
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds,
that
it
would
have
been
futile
for
the
defendant
to
object
to
jury
selection
by
the
magistrate,
and
therefore
the
requirements
of
rules
51
and
52
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
were
waived.
that
is
to
say
there
was
no
obligation
for
the
defendant
to
raise
this
point
in
the
district
court,
and
there
was
no
forfeiture
of
the
right
as
a
consequence
of
the
failure
to
raise
these
points.
the
respondent
here
has
made
a
number
of
different
arguments.
the
futility
point
was
the
only
one
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
we
have
addressed
and
will
address
here
each
of
the
various
arguments
that
respondent
has
raised
in
support
of
the
judgment
below.
turning
first
to
the
futility
argument,
it's
useful
i
think
first
to
start
with
the
simple
language
of
rules
51
and
52,
and
as
i'll
concede,
the
language
of
the
rules
does
not
contain
any
reference
to
any
futility
exception.
the
only
exception
in
rule
52
is
an
exception
for
plain
error,
and
that
is
generally
understood
to
be
error
which
was
quite
obvious
and
led
to
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
undermined
the
confidence
in
the
verdict,
undermined
the
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
in
some
cases
it
could,
your
honor,
and
let
me
suggest
that
i
think
there
is
a
difference
because
that
depends
entirely
on
who
that
person
was.
in
our...
our
submission
is
that
when
that
person
is,
as
was
the
case
in
this
case,
a
judicial
officer
who
is
completely
under
the
control
of
the
court,
is
somebody
who
is
hired
an
fired
by
the
court,
and
who
is
performing
a
task
which
is
subject
to
the
review
of
the
court,
that
if
there
is
an
article
iii
violation
it
is
not
one
which
is
so
grave
that
you
would
say
that
the
entire
proceeding
has
to
be
negated,
that
this
constitute
plain
error.
however,
i
would
hasten
to
add--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
the
fact
that...
it
is
accepted,
of
course,
that
congress
didn't
authorize
this
procedure
to
be
followed,
but
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
that
right,
and
it
is
a
right,
we
submit,
to
have
a
judge
conduct
jury
selection.
but
our
solution
is
that
that
is
a
right
which
can
be
waived
unless
it
constitutes
plain
error.
and
again,
we
submit
that
this
doesn't
constitute
plain
error.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
right.
we
submit
and
have
discussed
in
our
brief
the
reasons
that
we
feel
that
that
is
a
waivable
defect.
it
is
a
forfeitable
defect,
and
it
has
been
forfeited.
the...
there
are
many
rights,
statutory,
constitutional
rights
even,
that
can
be
forfeited
or
waived,
as
this
court
has
held
time
and
again,
that
don't
constitute
plain
error
even
though
they
may,
of
course,
be
cognizable
if
objected
to.
indeed
there
are
some
instances...
i
would
pick
for
example
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
grand
jury...
in
which
the
court
has
held
that
these
errors
may
not
be
deemed
harmless,
yet
the
court
has
further
said
that
if
not
objected
to
in
a
timely
basis
they
may
be
forfeited
or
waived
under
rule
51.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
the...
that
issue
is...
directly
addressed
by
the
davis
case,
for
example,
in
411
u.s.,
in
which
the
court
held
that
there
could
be
a
waiver
of
a
right
to
have
your
grand
jury
selected
in
a
nondiscriminatory
fashion.
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
court
has
said
that
you
can
waive
such
rights
as
the
right
to
confrontation,
the
right
to
compulsory
process...
a
number
of
trial
rights
that
can
be
waived
by
simply
nonassertion.
we
would
submit
that
this
case
falls
well
within
that
category
of
cases.
there...
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
here...
well,
we
don't
concede
that
there
is
a
constitutional
violation,
but
assuming
for
a
moment
that
there
is
a
constitutional
violation,
that
does
not
render
the
proceedings
subject
to
challenge
in
the
absence
and
objection.
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
cftc
case
against
schor,
not
a
criminal
case,
but
nonetheless
i
think
the
analysis
in
that
case
is
very
useful
in
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
true.
but
the
question--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
right,
but
i
am
addressing...
i
am
addressing
with
respect
to
schor
the
constitutional
question.
and
with
respect
to
that
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
fact
that
article
iii
has
both
a
component
that
is
designed
to
protect
the
individual
and
a
component
that
is
designed
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
a
magistrate
could
pick
a
grand
jury
in
the
sense
that
typically
i
think
a
grand
jury
is
selected
by
the
clerk
of
the
court.
the
clerk
of
the
court
gathers
the
names,
and
then
the
names
are
called
and
the
duty
of
putting
the
grand
jury
into
the
grand
jury
room
to
begin
its
deliberations
is
typically
quite
ministerial.
there
isn't
anything
very
important
that
happens
as--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
a
grand
jury
member
seeks
excuse
from
services?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
that
is
done
after
the
fact,
in
the
course
of...
let's
suppose
that
is
done
in
the
course
of
litigation.
after
the
defendant
is
indicted,
the
defendant
claims
that
there
was
something...
some
problem
with
one
of
the
grand
jurors.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
there...
there
have--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
in
fact
i
believe
mr.
levine,
counsel,
has
it
in
one
such
case
which
has
just
recently
been
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit,
in
which
he
did
object,
and
in
which
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
we
submit
that
the
difference
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
we
believe
it
is
much
more
than
a
formality,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
it's
a
very
important
principle,
as
this
court
has
recognized.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
it
is
more
than
a
formality,
and
i
would
like
to
address
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
gomez
did
object--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
that
is
certainly
so.
and
in
fact
that,
of
course,
is
the
basis
for
our
contention
that
that
case
is
to
be
distinguished
from
this
one.
i
think
with
respect
to
the
futility
exception,
it's
important
to
note
that
that
exception,
in
the
context
of
habeas
corpus,
where
this
issue
has
been
litigated
extensively,
has
been
firmly
rejected
by
the
court.
the
court
has
said
in
engle
against
isaac
that,
"the
futility
of
presenting",
and
i
am
quoting,
"the
futility
of
presenting
an
objection
to
the
state
courts
cannot
alone
constitute
cause
for
failure
to
object
at
trial.
"
again,
where
the
basis
of
a
constitutional
claim
is
available,
and
other
defense
counsel
have
perceived
and
litigated
that
claim,
it
does
not
constitute
cause
for
failure
to
object
at
trial.
now,
respondent
claims
that
although
those
cases
can
be
distinguished,
that
case
and
the...
murray
against
carrier
case
which
followed
it,
can
be
distinguished
on
the
grounds
that
those
are
habeas
corpus
cases.
but
we
don't
think
that
that
distinction
holds
water,
because
the
whole
cause
and
prejudice
doctrine
originated
in
a
federal
case,
and
originated
as
an
application
of
a
federal
waiver
rule,
rule
12.
it
is
clear
that
the
rule
with
respect
to
cause
is
at
least
as
strict
in
the
federal
system
as
it
is
under
the
language
with
respect
to
futility
that
i
have
just
read.
indeed,
rule
12
does
contain,
after
all,
an
exception
for
cause,
while
rule
51
and
rule
52
do
not.
so,
if
anything,
there
is
less
room
for
the
futility
doctrine
in
this
setting
than
in
the
setting
of
habeas
corpus
cases
where
the
court
has
applied
the...
the
cause
and
prejudice.
and
i
point
out
that
this
is
not
really
as
harsh
perhaps
as
it
may
sound,
because
of
course
waiting
in
the
wings
at
all
times
in
the
federal
direct
appeals
setting
is
the
plain
error
rule.
this
is
in
a
sense
the
safety
net
for
errors
that
we
feel
are
egregious
errors.
it
is...
it
is
to
be
applied
in
a
way
that
is
analogous
to
but
even
more
restrictive
against
the
government
than--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
difference
is
that
something
in
order
to
be...
there
may
be
errors
that...
as
to
what
you
cannot
say
that
they
are
harmless,
because
you
simply
cannot
say
with
the
confidence
that
is
required
for
the
harmless
error
doctrine--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
typically
you
have
to
look
at
each
case
to
decide
whether
a
particular
error
is
plain.
now,
there
may
be
some
errors
that
would
be
plain
with
respect
to
all
cases,
but
in
looking
at
plain
error
you
are
deciding
whether
there
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice
in
a
particular
case.
and
that's
the
reason
i
think
this
court
has
distinguished
between
cases
in
which
there
is...
it
is
impossible
to
determine
whether
an
error
is
harmless.
but
if
the
case,
if
the
error
is
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
the
later
claim
is
made
that
the
error
is
plain,
then
you
look
at
the
question
of
particular
prejudice.
the...
that...
that
point
was
made
in
davis
against
the
united
states
itself,
and
again,
if
i
may
quote,
the
court
explained
in
the
context
where
it
was
talking
about
an
error
that
could
not
be
deemed
to
be
harmless...
this
was
discrimination
in
the
grand
jury
context...
that
the
presumption
of
prejudice
that
supports
the
existence
of
the
right
is
not
inconsistent
with
a
holding
that
actual
prejudice
must
be
shown
in
order
to
obtain
relief
from
a
statutorily
provided
waiver
for
failure
to
assert
it
in
a
timely
manner.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
it
is
conceivable
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
language
of
the
rule
would
be
open
to
saying
that
the
error
is
plain,
that
is
to
say
it's
an
obvious
error,
but
it
really
doesn't
effect--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
way
this
court
has
read
the
rule
is,
it
seems
to
me
virtually
makes
it
impossible
for
you
to
have
a
plain,
harmless
error,
because
the
rule
has
been
read
to
include--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
it
has
come
to
that,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
because
this
court
has
said
that
it's
a
miscarriage
of
justice
that
has
to
be
shown
in
order
to
establish
a
plain
error,
i
think
that's--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
hard
argument
to
make,
and
i
am
not
making
it,
to
say
that
an
error
could
be
both
plain
and
also
harmless.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
you
could
use
the
language
that
way
but
i
think
the
way
the
court
has
used
the
term
plain
error
incorporates
the
notion
of--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
that
is
my
understanding
of
it.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
no.
no.
it
is
our
submission
that
you
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
error
in
plain,
but
of
course
if
you
rule
in
mr.
levine's
favor
of
one
of
the
other
issues
you
don't.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
don't
think
you
have
to,
because
i
think
that
you
can
resolve
the
question
without
addressing
the
question
of
whether
there
actually
was
an
article
iii
violation
here.
you
can
decide
that
if
there
was,
even
if
there
was,
it
was
waived.
it
is
our
submission
that
again,
reciting
the
schor
case,
that
it
is
possible
to
waive
even
a
violation
of
article
iii.
we
think
that
there
is
no
article
iii
violation
here,
but
even
assuming
that
there
is,
we
think
that
that
claim,
just
like
any
other
constitutional
claim,
was
waived.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
the
way
this
court
has
interpreted
the
rule,
the
fact
that
it
was...
if
it's
a
miscarriage
of
justice
i
think
it's
going
to
be
regarded
as
plain.
i
guess
it's
conceivable
you
could
have
an
error
that
was
not
obvious,
but
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
find
that
to
constitute
plain
error
even
if
it
was
not
obvious,
assuming
that
it
was
a--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
well,
that's...
i
can't
think
of
a
case,
and
this
is
again
adverting
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
can't
think
of
a
case
in
which
a
court
has
said
well,
the
error
is
plain,
but
of
course
we
don't
reverse.
i
think
there
may
have
been
such
a
case
at
some
time
in
the
past--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
that
that
is
effectively
what
the
court
has...
the
way
the
court
has
read
the
rule.
i
think
that
is
true.
with
respect
to
the
futility
doctrine,
if
i
can
address
not
just
the
language
of
the
rule
in
the
cases,
but
the
policies
underlying
such
a
doctrine,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
mischievous
to
have
a
doctrine
that
allowed
counsel
to
avoid
the
obligation
of
raising
a
particular
point
just
because
counsel
felt,
whether
reasonably
or
not,
that
the
immediately...
the
appellate
court
to
which
the
conviction
would
be
taken
would
be
not
likely
to
accept
such
a
claim
with
open
arms.
first
of
all,
the
whole
doctrine
of
futility
is
based
in
a
sense
on
a
false
premise,
which
is
that
it
would
be
futile,
and
these
cases
only
come
up
where
it
turns
out
not
to
have
been
futile.
if
this
case
had
come
up
with
an
objection
there
would
be
no
problem;
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mrs.
france
would
have
won
her
case.
furthermore,
it
just
invites
the
kind
of
messy
factual
determination
that
makes
the
application
of
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
extremely
cumbersome
if
you
have
to
go
back
and
decide
whether
the
degree
of
foreclosure,
if
you
will,
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
by
the
courts
generally
was
sufficiently...
sufficiently
grave
that
you
can
regard
the
question
as
futile.
the
kinds
of
cases
will
produce
questions
of
that
sort
in
time
and
time
again.
and
again,
if
i
can
refer
to
the
akins
case,
which
is
cited
by
respondent,
that
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
problem
here.
in
this
case,
for
example,
it
is
true
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
said
twice
before
that
there
was
no
constitutional
or
statutory
violation
by
virtue
of
jury
selection
by
magistrates.
but
at
the
time
of
this
trial
the
fifth
circuit
had
granted
rehearing
en
banc,
to
consider
en
banc
that
question,
and
one
could
have
anticipated
for
that...
from
that
without
a
great
deal
of
[inaudible]
that
it
was
likely
that
the
fifth
circuit
would
go
the
other
way
and
that
it
might
well
produce
a
case
before
this
court.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it,
the
court
granted
rehearing
en
banc
from
a
panel
that
had
gone
the
same
way
as
the
ninth
circuit.
it
is...
since
there
was
no
split
among
the
circuits
at
that
time,
it
seems
at
least
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
going
to
give
very
close
consideration
to
the
arguments
that
there
was
a
constitutional
or
statutory
problem
with
the
assignment.
i
think
that
it
would
be
at
minimum
prudent
for
someone
to
consider
that
the
likelihood
was
that
this
issue
was
going
to
go
farther
than
stopping
with
the
ninth
circuit
cases.
and
in
fact--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
might
have,
that
is
right.
that's--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly,
and
that
is
our
next
point,
which
is
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
ninth
circuit
cases
that
foreclosed
the
judge
from
picking
a
jury.
this
was
merely,
as
respondent
says,
it
was
a
practice
that
was
employed
in
the
district
court.
but
i
would
point
out,
however,
that
this
particular
judge
was
a
visiting
judge,
and
that
there
were
occasions
on
which
visiting
judges,
and
there
were
a
number
of
them
in
hawaii
during
this
period,
there
were
occasions
in
which
visiting
judges
would
pick
a
jury.
in
fact
in
the
akins
case
the
visiting
judge
offered
to
pick
a
jury
when
an
objection
was
made.
so
it's
by
no
means
clear
that
the
district
judge
would
not
have
agreed
either
simply
to
dispose
of
this
question
as
a
possible
appellate
issue
or,
because
the
visiting
judge
felt
more
comfortable
picking
juries,
that
the
visiting
judge
would
have
done
it.
indeed,
the
peacock
case
invited
courts,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
violation,
invited
courts
to
pick
a
jury,
and
pointed
out
that
there
were
many
good
reason
that
a
court
might
want
to
do
that.
but
in
any
event,
the
problem
of
trying
to
get
into
these
kinds
of
hearings,
deciding
on
a
case-by-case
basis
of
whether
this
objection
would
have
been
futile
or
not,
as
this
case
well
illustrates,
would
be,
would
render
the
rule
so
cumbersome
that
it
would
almost
not
be
worth
having,
at
least
with
respect
to
this
class
of
cases.
now,
the
next
point
that
i
would
like
to
address
i
have
adverted
to
already,
and
that
is
this,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
an
absence
of
jurisdiction
here,
in
the
jurisdictional
sense
that
the
court
uses
the
term
sometimes,
that
would
deprive
the...
that
would
be
either
automatic
reversal
or
would
deprive
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction
to
proceed.
the
article
iii
issue,
as
we
submit,
is
essentially
controlled
by
the
radats
case.
now,
it
is
true
that
this
court
in
gomez
held
that
the
statute
didn't
permit
jury
selection,
but
of
course
it
didn't
address
the
constitutional
question.
in
our
view,
if
you
take
the
factors
that
the
radats
case
found
to
solve
the
article
iii
problem,
those
factors
are
largely
present
here,
and
in
some
respects
this
case
is
an
easier
case
than
radats.
radats,
you
will
recall,
was
a
case
in
which,
as
all
agreed,
the
entire
case
turned
on
the
outcome
of
the
suppression
hearing.
it
was
either
up
or
down.
if
the
suppression
hearing
was
decided
against
the
defendant,
that
was
the
end
of
the
case.
if
it
was
decided
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
that
was
the
end
of
the
prosecution.
in
this
case
we
submit
that
jury
selection,
whatever
importance
it
may
have,
and
we
concede
that
it
has
real
importance
in
the
system,
it
can't
be
said
to
be
the
whole
case.
and
in
particular
in
this
case,
where
there
was
no
controversy
surrounding
this
jury
selection,
there
were
no
challenges
for
cause.
it
was
a
very
smooth
jury
selection.
there
were
no
objections
made
by
the
defendant
at
the
end
when
he
was...
when
she
was
invited
to
object
to
any
of
the
procedures
in
the
jury
selection.
it
is
very
hard
to
say
that
this
was
a
process
that...
in
which
the
magistrate
as
a
rogue
had
gone
off
on
his
own
and
done
something
which
really
rendered
the
district
court's
control
over
the
process
to
be
negatory.
in
this
case
the
magistrate
acted
under
the
supervision
of
the
district
judge.
the
district
judge
was
available
all
during
the
objections
to
answer
the
objections,
and
if
there
were
a
serious
objection
to
the
way
the
whole
process
had
been
conducted,
the
district
court,
of
course,
could
have
simply
done
it
again.
now,
we
recognize,
and
the
court
in
gomez
pointed
out
that
there
are
real
problems
with
trying
to
redo
or
fix
these
kinds
of
procedures
when
they
are
done
by
a
magistrate.
it's
inherent
in
the
process
of
delegating
another
person
to
do
a
task
that
the
judge
otherwise
would
perform.
but
that
would
be
the
same
situation
that
was
present
in
radats.
in
radats
the
problem
was
a
suppression
hearing,
and
that
suppression
hearing
was
conducted
entirely
by
the
magistrate.
the
court
held
that
article
iii
was
satisfied
by
the
degree
of
supervision
that
the
district
court
had
over
the
magistrate
in
general,
in
hiring,
firing,
and
supervising
its
conduct,
as
well
as
the
availability
at
least
to
some
extent,
of
correcting
error.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
don't
know
that
there's
anything
in
the
history.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
certainly--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
crewel
against
bentsen
was
essentially
a
delegation
case,
and
i
think
the
language
in
northern
pipeline
that
talks
about
the
use
of
an
adjunct
to
the
court
is
talking
essentially
about
delegation.
i
mean,
i
am
sensitive
to
the
problem
of
using
that
term.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
language...
the
language
of
article
iii,
your
honor,
has
much
in
it
that
might
support
that
view,
but
as
i
think
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
northern
pipeline,
there
has
been
a
lot
of
history
that
looks
the
other
way.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
very
briefly,
your
honor.
first
it's
i
think
important
to
focus
on
the
breadth
of
the
claim
here
with
respect
to
article
iii.
the
contention
is
that
even
with
consent
article
iii
bars
trials
in
which
a
magistrate
plays
any
material
role.
that
would,
i
take
it,
take
care
of,
throw
out
all
misdemeanor
trials
which
are
triable
by
magistrates
under
the
statute,
and
probably
as
well
all
civil
trials.
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
i
think
you
have
to
understand
the
degree
of
the
disruption
to
the
system,
as
well
as
the
degree
to
which
you
would
be
holding
the
magistrate's
act
unconstitutional.
because
there
is
nothing
in
article
iii,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
that
distinguishes
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors.
you
can
have
a
felony
which
results
in
a
smaller
sentence
than
a
misdemeanor,
which
is
up
to
a
year's
term
in
jail.
second,
the
contention
is
made
that
darlina
france
had
the
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
and
she
didn't
get
it.
well,
she
did
have
that
right.
she
just
didn't
ask
for
it,
and
that's
the
whole
point
here.
she
had
the
right
to
have
a
judge
conduct
the
jury
selection,
and
she
might
well
have
gotten
that
opportunity
had
she
asked
for
it.
she
didn't
ask
for
it.
as
to
the
suggestion
that
it
was
because
the
jury
was
selected
on
a
monday,
she
should
have
gone
in
the
previous
friday
and
said,
judge,
i
move
for
jury
selection
by
a
judge
and
not
by
the
magistrate.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i...
i
don't
know
whether
the
judge
had
arrived--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--but
the
judge
would
certainly
have
been
aware
of
any
motions
that
had
been
filed
in
court,
and
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
act
on
them.
and
if
the
judge
had
not
acted
on
them,
counsel
should
have
stood
up
at
the
time
the
jury
selection
began
and
said
my
motion
has
not
been
acted
on,
please
postpone
the
proceedings
until
it
is.
as
to
the
question
of
waiver
of...
the
question
of
the
novelty
exception,
we
do
not
concede
that
the
novelty
exception
applies
in
the
rule
51-52
context.
those
cases
in
which
the
novelty
exception
has
been
recognized
have
been
either
cases
in
which
this
court
has
addressed
questions
that
were
subjects
to,
as
the
court
perceived
them,
a
johnson
against
zerbst
waiver,
or
habeas
corpus
cases
such
as
reed
v.
ross,
in
which
the
court
was
applying
a
cause
and
prejudice
standard
and
construing
cause.
there
is,
as
we
pointed
out
earlier,
no
cause
exception
in
rule
51-52.
however,
we
don't
need
to
go
that
far.
the
court
doesn't
need
to
go
that
far.
in
engle
against
isaac
and
in
reed
against
ross
the
court
made
very
clear
the
distinction
between
a
novelty
exception
and
a
futility
exception.
it
said
that
yes,
novelty
is...
is
something
that
constitutes
cause
for
the
failure
to
raise
an
issue
below
because
novelty
comes
up
in
a
case
where
there
simply...
the
lawyer
simply
did
not
have
the
means
to
make
the
argument.
and
went
on
to
say
that
if
the
argument
was
one
that
others
were
making
at
the
time,
this
is
one
that
should
have
been
made,
it
doesn't
constitute
novelty.
that
is
this
case.
thank
you.
