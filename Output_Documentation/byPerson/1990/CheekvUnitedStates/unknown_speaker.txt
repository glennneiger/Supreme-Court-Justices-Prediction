mr.
coulson,
you
don't
have
to
go
to
law
school
to
learn
that
traditionally
mistake
of
law
is...
is
no
defense.
why
is
there,
why
should
it
be
a
defense
here,
because
of
the
word
willfully
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
should
that
be?
unknown
speaker
so
do
we
import
these
same
standards
into
the
antitrust
laws,
which
are
also
complex...
the
case
laws
if
not
statutory?
unknown
speaker
but
why
should
criminal
tax
statutes
be
singled
out
for
this
treatment?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
taxpayer
understood
that
the
law
says
you'll
file
a
tax
return,
but
genuinely
believed
the...
the
tax
law
was
unconstitutional?
would
that
be
a
defense
to
willfulness?
unknown
speaker
well,
someone
in
good
faith
believes
it.
it
is
not
objectively
reasonable
to
believe
that,
but
that
is
the
belief.
now
is
that
a
defense
to
willfulness?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
instruct
the
jury
so
that
they
can
convict
in
the
one
case
and
acquit
in
the
other?
unknown
speaker
a
known
law?
known
to
whom?
known
to
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
and
a
known
law
is
a...
is
a
statute
that
is
on
the
books?
unknown
speaker
he
knew
that
the
statute
was
on
the
books?
unknown
speaker
he
knows...
he
knows
his
duty
under
the
statute,
and
he
knows
that
it's
the
[inaudible]
of
the
government
to
prosecute
if
he
violates
that
duty.
is
that
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
that
he
also
knows
that
the
position
of
the
irs
and
of
the
justice
department
is
to
the
contrary?
what
result?
unknown
speaker
on
what
standing?
unknown
speaker
he
really...
he
honestly...
it's
an
honest
belief?
sincerity
of
belief,
that's
the
test?
unknown
speaker
suppose...
the
seventh
circuit
has
ruled
that
he
has
to
file
and
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
ruled
contrary
to
his
beliefs.
unknown
speaker
xxx
the
seventh
circuit
has
ruled
that
his
belief
was
held
in
error.
unknown
speaker
he
thinks
in
good
faith
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
wrong.
what
does
the
jury
have
to
do
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
should
the
jury
convict
him
based
on...
this
is
what
i
want
to
know.
what
is
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
stipulating
to
you
that
he
has
an
honest,
sincere
belief
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
180
degrees
wrong.
unknown
speaker
the
question
isn't
what--
--justice
marshall
has
had
a
question
he
wants
to
ask.
would
you
make
the
same
defense
to
a
civil
action?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
what
i
would
like
for
you
to
explain,
other
than
that
civil
and
criminal
are
different.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
a
tax
defense...
a
tax
case?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
follow
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
because
i
don't
think
you
have
answered.
you
have
given
us
a
prediction
what
the
jury
would
do.
say
you
are
a
trial
judge
and
you
are
convinced
that
when
this
man
gets
on
the
stand
and
says
i
think
not
only
the
seventh
circuit
is
wrong,
but
the
united
states
supreme
court
is
wrong,
and
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
me
to
pay
these
taxes.
that's
my
sincere
and
honest
belief,
just
like
my
belief
in
god
is
sincere
and
honest.
does
he
win
or
does
he
lose?
unknown
speaker
he
believes
him.
that's
what
i
am
saying,
the
judge
believes
him.
then
what
does
the
judge
do?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
belief
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
is
a
belief
that
it's
wrong?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
what
murdock...
murdock
was
a
constitutional
case,
you
know.
you
can
even
stop
short
of
the
unconstitutional
point.
all...
you're...
you're
stopping
short...
you
want
to
stop
short
of
saying
that
a
belief
that
is
unconstitutional
is
a
good...
like
some
of
the
other
justices,
i
don't
see
the
basis
for
drawing
that
line.
but
you
don't...
you
don't
stop
short
of
saying
that
belief
that
the
supreme
court
has
misinterpreted
the
statute
is...
is
not
a
good-faith
defense.
suppose
he
doesn't
think
that
the
constitution
entitles
him
to
say
that
wages
are
not
income,
but
that
simply
the
supreme
court
got
it
wrong
when
it
said
that
under
the
internal
revenue
code
wages
are
not
income
and
said,
you
know,
gee,
the
supreme
court
said
that,
but
they
misinterpreted
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
which
is
this?
is
this
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
or
not?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
not?
he
thinks
the
supreme
court
was
wrong.
he
thinks
the
supreme
court
misread
the
statute.
he
sits
down
and
looks
at
the
statute
and
says,
gee,
i
think
they
got
it
wrong
again.
unknown
speaker
that
is
disagreement
with
the
law?
unknown
speaker
i
am
surprised
at
your
position.
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
would
be
arguing
that
it's
a
sincere,
good-faith
belief
that
is
not
willful.
that
is
what
i
thought
your
position
was
below.
unknown
speaker
but
only...
in
other
words,
everything
goes
to
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
those
beliefs
were
not
objectively
reasonable
beliefs?
unknown
speaker
did
you
preserve
that
issue
for
review
here
then,
or
do
we
have
to
take
it
on
the
assumption
that
they
were
not
objectively
reasonable
beliefs?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
our
assumption
for
deciding
the
case,
and
did
you
preserve
that
issue
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
part
of
your
claim
is,
if
you
preserved
it,
that
it's
objectively
reasonable
to
think
that
wages
are
not
income?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
but
then
what
use
is
the
term
objectively
reasonable,
if
it
is
an
individualized
determination
and
if
it
would
be...
objectively
unreasonable
for
most
people,
but
not
objectively
unreasonable
for
your
client?
unknown
speaker
well,
what,
what
standard
were
you
applying
when
you
answered
these
questions
about
if
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
wages
are
income
and
he...
you
say
that
he
couldn't
possibly
have...
have
a
defense
in
that
respect.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
he
knows
it,
but
he
says
they
got
it
wrong.
they
got
it
wrong,
and
i
sincerely
believe
that
they
misread
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
standard
are
you
applying
in
saying
that?
objectively
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
he...
he
mistakenly
thought
the
supreme
court
had
it
wrong.
he
just
made
a
mistake.
why
isn't
that
a
defense?
unknown
speaker
or
suppose
that
the
treasury
regulations
say
wages
are
income
and
are
taxable,
and
he
says
well,
i
know
that,
and
regulation
is
supposed
to
be
the
law,
but
the
commissioner
just
had
it
wrong.
they...
those
regulations
are
just
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
or
with
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
counselor,
that
is
just
not
helpful
for
this
argument.
what
we're
trying
to
establish,
and
i
think
it's
a
difficult
case,
is
what
instruction
the
judge
should
give
to
the
jury.
what
is
the
standard
for
guilt.
and
if
you
say,
oh,
that's
for
the
jury,
that
doesn't
help
us.
we're
asking
what
the
instruction
should
be.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
based
on
your
case,
you
have
to
say
that
if
he
sincerely
believes
that
the
supreme
court
got
it
wrong,
that
is
a
defense.
i
think
that's
the
theory
of
your
case.
and
if
you
say,
well,
the
supreme
court,
then
i
would
ask
you
about
the
seventh
circuit,
or
i
would
ask
you
about
a
supreme
court
decision
which
is
5
to
4
and
a
justice
leave
the
bench,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
we
need
to
know
what
standard
the
judge
uses
when
he
instructs,
or
she
instructs
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
mr.
coulson,
can
i
just
ask
one
question?
is
this
issue,
whether
the
mistake
of
law
issue,
are
you
contending
that
it's
a
failure
of
proof
of
part
of
an
element
of
the
government's
affirmative
case,
or
that
this
is
an
affirmative
defense
with
respect
to
what
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
had
an
honest
misunderstanding?
unknown
speaker
your
client
was
an
american
airlines
pilot,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
xxx
the
government
proved
willfulness?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
that...
why
did
you
need
a
defense
then,
other
than
to
say
there's
a
failure
of
proof?
unknown
speaker
but
again
he
did
not
have
to
put
on
that
defense
unless
the
government
had
put
in
evidence
that
he
knowingly
violated
a...
violated
a
known
duty
to
obey
the
law,
right?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
they
had
proved--
unknown
speaker
--at
least
prima
facie
they
had
proved
willfulness.
unknown
speaker
but
the
conclusion
of
your
argument
is
that
he
has
therefore
established
an
affirmative
defense
known
as
mistake
of
law.
it
is
not
that
ergo
there
is
a
failure
to
prove
willfulness.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
not
deciding
whether
there's
willfulness.
they
are
deciding
the
separate
issue,
whether
there
is
an
affirmative
defense
of
legal
mistake,
as
i
understand
you.
unknown
speaker
did
he
take
any
position
about
the
withholding
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
agreed
that
withholding
was
okay.
unknown
speaker
did
you
submit
an
instruction
to
the
jury
on
mistake
of
law
as
an
affirmative
defense?
unknown
speaker
well
then
did
mr.
cheek
submit
an
instruction
on
mistake
of
law?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
substance
of
the
instruction?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand.
how
can
you
avoid
applying
it
to
other,
you
know...
how
can
you
avoid
applying
it
across
the
board
to
all
taxpayers
who
fail
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
you
don't
mean
that
they...
that
they
apply
their
rule
only
to
tax
protesters.
you
mean
that
their
rule
only
identifies
tax
protesters.
is
that
what
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--but,
certainly
that
point
is
not
raised
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
the
suggestion
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
has
unfairly
applied
its
law
to
tax
protesters.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
shouldn't
have
to
read
back
to
you
the
two
questions
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
to
me
the
idea
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
deliberately
treated
tax
protesters
differently
than
other
tax
defendants
to
whom
it
is
equally
applicable
is
not
fairly
subsumed
in
those
questions.
the
first
is
"is
the
seventh
circuit's
unique
approach,
under
which
petitioner
was
convicted
and
jailed
because
a
panel
announced
that
his
sincerely
held
beliefs
were
unreasonable
and
therefore
impermissible,
consistent
with
the
statutes
under
which
petitioner
was
convicted."
"2."
"if
so,
is
the
seventh
circuit's
approach
consistent
with
the
first,
fifth,
and
sixth
amendments?"
those
are
complaints
about
the
way
the
seventh
circuit
decide...
decided
your
client's
case.
they
don't
to
me
import
any
suggestion
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
not
even
handed
in
deciding
similarly
situated
cases.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
coulson.
mr.
kneedler.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
seventh
circuit
though
said
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
his
actions
were
innocent
if
they
were
not
objectively
reasonable.
so
to
argue
here
that
they
weren't
even
innocent,
i
don't
think
is
very
acceptable.
unknown
speaker
but
you
made
the
statement
that
he
was
not
innocent,
which
to
me
means
that
he
did
not
sincerely
believe
this.
and
of
course
the
jury
was
never
given
an
opportunity--
unknown
speaker
--who
is
unreasonable
is
not
innocent.
unknown
speaker
somebody
who
is
unreasonable
is
not
innocent.
our
jails
will
be
full,
mr.
kneedler.
unknown
speaker
but
the
gloss...
the
gloss
we
put
on
it
in
murdock
is
that
quote,
"an
evil
motive"...
and
evil
motive...
"is
a
constituent
element
of
the
crime."
unknown
speaker
well,
here
he
says
he
was
somehow
fooled
into
believing
that
his
conduct
was
lawful.
unknown
speaker
and
i
guess
we
have
to
take
the
case
on
that
assumption.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's...
that's
for
the
jury.
we
are
talking
about
the
instruction.
unknown
speaker
is
the
problem
here
with
the
term
known
legal
duty?
is
that
where
we're
having
difficulty?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
understand
that,
mr.
kneedler.
i
understand
he
disagreed
with
whether
the
code...
his
position
was
that
the
code
did
not
require
it,
despite
what
the
courts
had
said,
despite
what
the
regulations
said.
he
didn't
think
the
code
required
that.
i
thought
that
was
what
the
facts
of
this
case
are.
unknown
speaker
he's
abandoning
that,
as
i
understood
the
argument.
illogically,
perhaps,
but
the
assertion
is
not
being
made
that
if
he
thinks
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
he
has
a
defense.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
the
murdock
case
though,
the
defense
was
based
on
a
constitution...
belief
that
the
constitution
did
not
require
him
to
incriminate
himself.
unknown
speaker
why
should
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
were
a
closely
debated
and
open
question
on
which
scholars
disagreed
as
to
the
constitutional
issue?
unknown
speaker
congress
could
avoid
being
reduced
to
chaos
by
removing
the
willfully
requirement.
unknown
speaker
or
the
courts
could
change
their
interpretation
of
willfulness.
the
courts
are
the
ones
that
put
this
spin
on
willfulness
in
the
tax
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
you...
and
you
say
that
there
is
a
special
rule
about
willfulness
in
tax
cases.
you
accept
that.
unknown
speaker
and
all
it...
and
that
he
must...
he's
entitled
to
have
a
mistake
of
law.
unknown
speaker
so
he
must
know
what
his
legal
duty
is.
unknown
speaker
aware
of
his
legal
duty.
and
if
says
i
am
not
aware
of
it,
and
the
jury
believes
him,
he's
off.
unknown
speaker
is
he
aware
of
the
legal
duty
if
he
disagrees
with
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
legal
duty?
unknown
speaker
so
all
he
has
to
know
is
that
the
irs
takes
a
position
different
than
he
does?
unknown
speaker
he
hasn't
preserved
that
question,
has
he,
whether
wages
are
income?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
to
wrestle
with
that
one,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
take
your...
i
understand
your
argument
why...
a
constitutional
concern.
we
understand
what
the
statute
requires.
supposing
a
taxpayer
honestly
advised
by
counsel
believes
that
a
regulation
does
not
comply
with
the
internal
revenue
code,
but
he
knows
very
well
what
the
regulation
requires.
criminal
or
not?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
sincere
belief.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
leave
out--
unknown
speaker
--all
right,
okay.
i
just
mean
a
sincere
belief
that
a
regulation
is
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
defense
if
it's
a
plausible
belief?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
different
from
a
plausible
belief
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
kneedler,
is
it
plausible
on
a
subjective
basis
or
plausible
on
an
objective
basis?
i
mean,
that
is
the
question.
you
say
plausible--
unknown
speaker
--well,
suppose...
suppose
there's...
suppose
there's
a
baggage
worker
or
a
janitor,
not
a
pilot,
but
he
is
working
for
american
airlines.
and
some
one
of
his
coworkers
announced,
remember
now
that
wages
aren't
income,
this
is
a
new
theory.
and
he
really
believes
that.
and
he
is
just
as
wrong
as
he
can
be,
but
he
believes
it.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
instruction,
mr.
kneedler?
unknown
speaker
he
knows
that
it's
in
the
code,
but
he
has
been
told
that
the
code
section's
invalid.
and
he
really
believes
it
and
he
is
really
dumb.
unknown
speaker
you
agree
that
he
has
to
know
more
than
what
the
regulations,
the
tax
code
regulations
say?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
he...
he
knows
it,
but
he
can
still
get
off.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
the...
suppose
the
regulation
that
he
thinks
is
not
consistent
with
the
statute
has
been
upheld
as
being
consistent
by
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
so
i
take
it
you
do
accept
the
seventh
circuit
saying
that
there
has
to
be
more
than
knowledge
of,
say,
the
provision
of
a
regulation?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
i
know,
but
the
seventh
circuit
would
say
that
if
it's
objectively
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
regulation
is
invalid,
he
gets
off.
unknown
speaker
you
accept
that?
unknown
speaker
but
an
exception
that
wasn't
invented
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
unknown
speaker
invented
by
this
court
in
murdock.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
defense
that
makes
a
whole
lot
of
sense,
mr.
kneedler.
let's
not
deprecate
it.
i
take
it
that
the
reason
we
treat
the
tax
laws
differently
is
that
everybody
probably
makes
some
mistake
or
other
with
respect
to
the
complexities
of
the
tax
laws
now
and
then.
and
if
the
only
defense
against
going
to
jail
for
those
mistakes
is...
is
throwing
yourself
on
prosecutorial
discretion,
we
are
all
in
the
hands
of
federal
prosecutors
who
can
choose
to
pursue
us
or
not
to
pursue
us
as
suits
their
convenience.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
would
still
be
treating
tax
cases
specially
if
you
said
you
have
to
show
that
he
knew
what
the
law
was.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
need
to...
you
don't
need
to
have
the
objectively
reasonable
business
at
all--
unknown
speaker
--in
order
to
treat
the
tax
cases
specially.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
you
accept
the
seventh
circuit's
objectively
reasonable--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
the
mistake
of
law
defense
is
that
broad.
unknown
speaker
and
how
is
the
person
who
may
be
retarded
or
otherwise
lacking
in
understanding
to
be
protected
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
you
keep
reciting
that
phrase
and
i
have
the
same
trouble
that
justice
kennedy
does
with
it,
that
he
has
to
have
knowledge
of
the
legal
duty
imposed
by
the
code.
but,
i
mean,
that
is
circular.
he
is
always
contending
that
there
is
no
legal
duty
under
the...
under
the
code.
what
do
you
mean
by
he
has
knowledge
of
the
legal
duty?
what
precisely
do
you
mean
by
it?
he
is
always
saying
i
think
the
code
doesn't
impose
a
legal
duty.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
somebody
who
reads
the
regulation
and
says
that
regulation,
i
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
interpretation
of
the
code.
unknown
speaker
so
he
has
no
knowledge
of
the
duty
imposed
by
the
code
then,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
all
he
has
to
know
is
the
regulation.
he
has
to
know
the
existence
of
the
regulation,
and
that...
that's
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
of
how
the
mentally
retarded
person
is
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you're
saying
again
he
has
to
know
the
legal
duty.
what
is
legal
duty?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
also
go
along
with
the
seventh
circuit
that
there
is
a
laundry
list
of
per
se
nonobjectively
reasonable
items?
unknown
speaker
which
should
never
have
to
go
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
kneedler,
the
question
whether
a
particular
claim
is
objectionably
reasonable
or
not
then
becomes
a
question
of
law
if
the
court
can
specify
a
list.
it
and
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
should
it?
unknown
speaker
would
it
not
have
been
correct
then
for
the
district
court
to
in
effect
instruct
the
jury
to
reject
this
defense,
because
it
was
based
on
objectionably...
items
on
the
laundry
list.
he
says
those
are
not
a
defense;
just
tell
the
jury
that.
unknown
speaker
say
you
had
a
closer
case,
maybe
not
wage
or
not
income,
would
the...
should
the
judge
decide
and
tell
the
jury
whether
a
particular
claim
is
objectionably
reasonable
or
not,
or
let
the
jury
decide
this
semi-legal
question?
unknown
speaker
the
court
decided
it
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
the
solution
to
this
problem
is
never
to
instruct
the
jury
on
an...
to
make
an
objectively
reasonable
determination,
but
have
the
judge
decide
whether
or
not
the
defense
is
sufficient
or
not,
assuming
that--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
kneedler,
the
problem
with
that
and
the
problem
with
having
a
laundry
list,
as
the
seventh
circuit
does,
is
that
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
and
using
the
term
willfully
clearly...
clearly
requires
an
individuated
determination.
if
someone
visits
the
supreme
court
and
a
supreme
court
justice
tells
him
i
assure
you,
my
boy,
wages
are
not
income,
is...
is
his
reasonableness
in
believing
that
wages
are
not
income
no
different
from
the
reasonableness
of
someone
who
just...
just
hears
it
from
somebody
on
the
street?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
your
known
legal
duty.
the
more
you
explain
it,
the
less
i
understand
it.
i
do
understand,
however,
that
you're...
that
you
are
trying
to
decide
reasonableness
on
an
across-the-board
basis.
it's
reasonable
for
everybody,
it
is
unreasonable
for
everybody
in
the
world
to
believe
x.
and
i
am
not
sure
that's
true,
and
i
think
the
statute
does
require
an
individuated
determination.
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
didn't
object
to
the
business
of
unreasonable
belief
going
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
have
said
that
the
issue
didn't
need
to
go
to
the
jury
at
all,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
the
judge
in
effect
took
it
away
from
the
jury,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
only
after
the
jury
asked
some
questions.
unknown
speaker
only
when
the
jury
asked
some
questions.
only
when
the
jury
understood
the
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
because
this
jury
insisted
on
getting
a
clear
explanation
of
what
a
known
legal
duty
is.
[laughter]
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
there's
a
whole
range
of
civil
penalties.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
criminal
statute,
not
the
civil
recovery
provisions
and
the
civil
penalties
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
i
seems
to
me,
if
you
say
you
have
to
prove
that
he
knew
what
his
legal
duty
was,
and
yet
you
can
say
he
has
a
sincere
belief
that
there
is
no
such
duty,
how
can
he
possibly
know
it?
i
think
you
probably
really
now
say,
well,
he
really
knew
it,
even
if
he
has
a
belief
that
he
doesn't
have
a
duty.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
define
law
to
be
not
just
what
this
court
has
said,
but
also
whatever
is
set
forth
in
the
regulation.
unknown
speaker
if
he
reads
that
he
knows
what
the
law
is,
you
tell
us.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
coulson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
government...
wanted
to
add...
provided
you
know
the
government
is
going
to
disagree
with
you
and
enforce
its
laws
and
prosecute
you.
unknown
speaker
not
from
those
lawyers.
well,
i
guess
he
had
taken
the
issue
to
court
in
civil
litigation
and
been
told,
hadn't
he?
unknown
speaker
which
they
are
likely
to
think.
i
mean,
they're
more
likely
to
think
he
is
a
phony
if
it's
an
unreasonable
belief.
i
mean,
you
say,
oh,
come
on,
nobody--
