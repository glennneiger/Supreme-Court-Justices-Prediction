mr.
william
r.
coulson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
criminal
tax
case.
just
before
sentencing
the
petitioner,
john
l.
cheek,
the
district
court
said
to
him,
"i
do
not
want
to
sentence
you
for
beliefs
that
i
believe
were
honestly
held,
although
i
believe
foolishly
held."
that
is
the
district
court
speaking,
and
that
is
what
this
case
is
fundamentally
all
about.
petitioner
john
cheek's
defense,
albeit
a
pro
se
defense,
was
a
classic
mistake
of
law
based
in
part
on
advice
he
got
from
counsel.
he
contended
that
at
all
times
of
the
alleged
offenses
he
had
a
bona
fide
misunderstanding
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
laws.
this
is
a
recognized
defense.
it
was
articulated
by
this
court
in
murdock
in
1933,
some
57
years
ago.
however,
not
more
than
3
weeks
before
petitioner's
trial
commenced
before
the
seventh
circuit...
before
the
district
court
in
chicago,
the
seventh
circuit
in
october
of
1987
in
the
united
states
v.
buckner
decided
that
in
so-called
tax-protester
cases
it
wasn't
enough
that
the
tax
defendant's
misunderstanding
or
belief,
as
the
seventh
circuit
calls
it,
be
sincerely
held
or
bona
fide
per
murdock,
but
also
the
defendant's
understanding
or
belief
of
the
tax
laws
had
to
be
found
by
the
jury
to
be
objectively
reasonable,
whatever
that
means.
moreover,
as
to
certain
enumerated
understandings,
or
beliefs,
or
misunderstandings
of
the
tax
laws,
it
wasn't
enough
even
for
a
defendant
to
convince
a
jury
that
he
sincerely
possessed
the
misunderstanding
and
that
the
misunderstanding
was
objectively
reasonable.
but
as
to
those
listed
beliefs
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
they
were
forever
objectively
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
because
this
court
and
other
courts
have
recognized
that
in
the
criminal
tax
statutes,
the
mistake
of
law
defense
has
particular
vitality.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
because
the
tax
codes
are
complex
in
numerous
respects.
unlike
most
criminal
statutes
they
are
malum
prohibitum
rather
than
malum
in
se.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
doctrine
that
we
suggest
remain
the
law
of
the
land
be
applied
to
anything
other
than
criminal
tax
statutes.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
this
court
has
singled
them
out
for
that
treatment
and
other
courts
have,
recognizing
that
in
the
tax
area
it
is
easy,
relatively
easy
for
a
well-minded
individual
to
violate
the
law,
because
the
law
is
complex.
mistake
of
law
has
particular
vitality
in
this...
under
these...
in
this
context
and
under
the
criminal
tax
statutes.
and
i
say
that
not
only
because
this
court
has
said
that,
the
circuits
have
said
that.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
no,
but
it's...
personal
belief
that
a
known
statute
is
unconstitutional
smacks
of
knowledge
with
existing
law,
but
disagreement
with
it.
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
any
individuals--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
defense.
if
the
person
believes
as
a
personal
belief
that
known...
law
known
to
them
is
unconstitutional,
i
submit
that
that
would
not
be
a
defense,
because
what
the
person
is
really
saying
is
i
know
what
the
law
is,
for
constitutional
reasons
i
have
made
my
own
determination
that
it
is
invalid.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
is
a
defense.
however,
if
the
person
was
told
by
a
lawyer
or
by
an
accountant
erroneously
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
it's
my
professional
advice
to
you
that
you
don't
have
to
follow
it,
then
you
have
got
a
little
different
situation.
this
is
not
that
case--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--you
instruct
the
jury
that
disagreement
with
known
law
is
not
a
defense.
you
instruct
the
jury
that--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--known
to
the
defendant.
all
of...
our
position
obviously
is
that
all
of
this
deals
with
the
defendant's
personal
view,
the
defendant's
personal
state
of
mind,
the
defendant's
personal
knowledge.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
no.
if
the
government
can
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
what
the
law
is
and
chose--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--no,
he
knew
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
laws
a
la
murdock.
that
is
a
little
broader
than
just
knowing
there
is
a
statute
on
the
books.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
no,
because
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
misunderstanding
that
is
in
issue.
a
defendant
may
believe
that...
that
bribes
that
he
receives
is
not
income.
he
may
believe
that,
as
in
this
case,
wages
he
receives
are
not
income.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
the
result
is
that
a
jury
decides
whether
his--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--his
understanding
is
pretextual
or
is
sincere,
based
on
all
of
this
information.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
the
test
is
sincerity
of
belief
as
to
his
understanding
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
laws,
and
that
is
taken
from
murdock.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
a
ruling
that
he
has
to
file
may
or
may
not
be
relevant
to
his
own
belief
given
his
tax
situation.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
that
would
be
a
fact
which
the
government
would
elicit.
the
jury
would
determine,
based
on
that
fact
as
well
as
other
facts
that
the
defendant
may
present,
whether
or
not
his
good
faith...
his
misunderstanding
is
in
good
faith
or
is
pretextual,
just
as
the
jury
does
in
any
other--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--no.
if
he
testifies
and
the
government
is
able
to
elicit
on
cross-examination
that
he
is
aware
of
the
seventh
circuit
case,
and
he
is
aware
the
seventh
circuit
thinks
he
is
wrong,
i
rather
suspect
the
jury
would
convict
him
in
this
situation.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
the
standard
is
whether
he
has
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
of
his
particular
duties
under
the
tax
laws.
that
is
the
standard
this
court
set
out
in
murdock.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i
would
submit
that
that
would
establish,
at
least
if
i
were
on
the
jury,
as
disagreement
with
what
he
knows
to
be
the
law.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
no.
civil
standards
are
different.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i
guess
the
most
obvious
example
is
his
rule
11,
or
sanctions.
you
could
take
a
legal
position
that
is
sanctionable
under
rule
11,
even
if
you
believe
it
to
be
true,
if
it's
a
frivolous
position.
whereas
to
put
somebody
in
jail,
to
convict
somebody
of
a
criminal
offense,
it
seems
to
me
the
government
needs
to
show
that
it
was
a
willful
act.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
in
a
tax
case.
i
am
confining
all
of
my
remarks
here
to
tax
cases
because,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
the
willfulness
element
is
somewhat
unique
in
tax
cases.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
in
that
case
the
judge,
as
he
would
in
evaluating
any
defense--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--the
judge
rules
that
that
is
not
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
of
one's
duties
to
file.
it
is
rather
a
knowledge
of
existing
law
and
a
belief
that
it
is
wrong,
and
that
defense
does
not
go
to
the
jury.
and
that--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--yes.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i
am
trying
to
draw
a
distinction
between
knowing
what
the
law
is
and
disagreeing
with
it,
which
is
not
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
of
your
duty
to
file.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
it
sounds
like
it
is
not.
i
must
point
out--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--that
is
disagreement
with
the
law.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
right.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
well,
it
is.
that
is
my
position.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
not
at
all.
this
case
did
not
involve
mr.
cheek's
contentions
that
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional,
and
that's
why
i
am
dealing
with
these
hypotheticals
the
way
i
am.
he
had
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
statutes
in
a
number
of
various
ways
based
on
all
the
indoctrination
he
got.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i
do
not
concede
that.
i
believe--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--we
don't
know
what
objectively
reasonable
means.
i
don't--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--our
position
is
that
there
should
be
no
such
test
as
whether
the
contents
of
a
belief
are
objectively
reasonable
or
not.
i
don't
know
if
i
am
answering
your
question.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
it
would
be
objectively
unreasonable
to
a
lawyer
or
to
a
judge.
it
might
well
be,
and
i
contend
here
it
was
objectively
reasonable
to
somebody
like
mr.
cheek,
who
was
a
lay
person
and
who
was
confused
and
who
was
hit
with
this
tax-protester
literature
and
these
lectures
and
these
statements
from
attorneys.
our
point
is
isn't
it
an
individualized
determination
of
each
defendant?
mr.
william
r.
coulson
that
illustrates
the
impossibility
of
dealing
with
what...
the
term
the
seventh
circuit
has
defined.
objectively
reasonable,
what
does
it
mean?
what
is
it?
it
would
differ
from
case
to
case.
it
would
differ
from
jury
to
jury.
it
would
differ
from
judge
to
judge.
i'm
arguing
there
should
be
no
such
standard
as
objectively
reasonable.
it
ought
to
be
a
question
of
whether
the
jury
finds
that
the
defendant
sincerely
believes...
has
a
sincere
misunderstanding
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
law.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
no.
if
he
knows...
if
the
government
proves
he
knows
that
the
supreme
court
has
held
that.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i
am
not
suggesting
that
disagreement
with
known
law
can
be
excused.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
no.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i
am...
the
standard
i
am
applying
is
the
one
set
out
in
murdock.
did
the
defendant
have
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
laws?
if
the
defendant...
that
does
not
include
disagreement
with
the
law.
it
means
it's
confusion
or
misunderstanding
with
his
duties
under
the
law
that
is
a
defense.
and
i
am
suggesting
that
that
has
to
be
a
determination--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--because...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
every
citizen
has
the
prerogative
to
decide
for
himself
if
he
is
going
to
obey
what
this
court
or
any
other
court
says.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
the
first
example
would
present
for
the
jury
a
fact
question.
the
jury
would
decide,
is
he
sincerely
confused
about
the
law,
and
if
so
how?
how
did
he
come
to
that
confusion,
that
misunderstanding?
or
is
he
pretextual,
does
he
know
darn
well
what
the
law
is?
mr.
william
r.
coulson
the
judge
says
to
the
jury
it
is
a
defense
to
willfulness
if
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
offenses
had
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
laws.
it
is
not
a
defense
if
the
defendant
had...
knew
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
law,
but
had
a
personal
or
subjective
disagreement
with
them.
that's
essentially...
part
of
those
instructions
were
given
in
this
case.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
obviously
the
government
has
the
burden
in
the
first
instance
of
its
proving
willfulness.
it
is
in
the
nature
of
an
affirmative
defense,
a
mistake
of
law,
based
on
in
this
case
advice
of
counsel
and
various
other
things.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
yes.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i
do
not
agree
that
the
government
proved
willfulness.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
well,
that
was
raised
at
trial
when
the
government
rested.
of
course
the
motion
was
overruled
under
the
seventh
circuit
standards,
and
mr.
cheek
put
on
a
defense.
and
his
defense
was
that
he
had
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
laws,
based
on
a
number
of
factors.
based
on
his
cult-like
indoctrination
he
got.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
right.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
and
they
had
introduced
some
evidence.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
right.
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
mr.
cheek
or
any
other
defendant
is
necessarily
going
to
prevail
in
his
mistake
of
law
defense.
obviously
i
am
saying
he's
entitled
to
present
it
to
a
jury.
it's
a
fact
question
for
the
jury
whether
he
possessed
a
mistake
of
law.
it
is
not,
as
the
seventh
circuit
has
held,
a
legal
question,
a
question
in
which
they
are
going
to
launch
this
preemptive
strike.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
well,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
it...
and
it
comes
down
to
a
jury
question.
the
government
has
its
evidence,
they
have
enough
evidence
of
willfulness
to
get
past
a
directed
verdict.
mr.
cheek
puts
on
his
evidence
as
mistake
of
law.
from
all
these
facts
and
all
this
mix
the
jury
has
to
decide,
as
they
do
in
every
case
in
this
country
every
day,
whether
he
is
a
sham
or
whether
he
is
sincerely
confused.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
the
affirmative
defense
negates
willfulness,
so
the
two
are
related.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i...
not...
not
per
se,
your
honor.
he...
he
filed
withholding
statements
to
have
his...
to
have
his
wages
withheld...
the
withholding
stopped,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
no,
he
fought
withholding.
he
filed
a
civil
suit
against
withholding.
he
filed
w-4's
claiming
he
was
exempt.
the
usual
indoctrination
that
somebody
who
goes
to
these
meetings
of
these
tax
protesters
gets.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
in
this,
no.
in
this
case
mr.
cheek
was
pro
se
at
the
trial
level,
and
essentially
judge
plunkett
construct...
put
all
the
instructions
together
for
him.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
yes,
there
was
an
instruction.
he
did
and
he
didn't.
he
orally
discussed
it
with
judge
plunkett,
and
judge
plunkett
drafted
it
for
him
because
he
was
pro
se.
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
the
substance
of
the
instruction
was...
was
buckner,
which
judge
plunkett
felt
compelled
to
give,
that
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
has
to
be
sincere
and
objectively
reasonable.
the
jury
was
confused.
the
jury
couldn't
agree.
the
jury
sent
out
notes
what
does
this
mean?
we
think
he
is
sincere,
what
does
this
mean?
the
judge
reinstructed
him,
and
then
the
judge
instructed
him
that,
per
buckner,
wages
of
not
income
is
a
prohibited
belief.
it
cannot
form
the
basis
for
a
good-faith
defense.
but
that
was
not
tendered
until
after
the
jury
was
out,
after
the
jury
had
had
some
questions.
and
i
think
it
illustrates
the
difficulty
that
judge
plunkett
and
other
district
judges
have
had
trying
to
apply
this
buckner-cheek
doctrine.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
problems
with
buckner-cheek.
it
was
decided
in
october
of
'87,
it
was
applied
retroactively
to
cheek's
trial,
even
though
the
offenses
that
cheek
had
allegedly
committed
took
place
in
1981
to
the
spring
of
1987,
before
buckner.
this
buckner-cheek
doctrine,
you
look
at
the
buckner
and
cheek
and
the
dunkel
case,
in
the
seventh
circuit
it
is
applied
only
to
tax
protesters.
it
is
not
applied
to
more
traditional
tax-evasion
defendants
in
the
seventh
circuit.
it
has
not
been
applied
in
any
other
circuit
in
this
country.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
i
agree
completely,
and
that
is
a
problem
with
the
way
the
seventh
circuit
has
done
it.
they
have
singled
out
tax
protesters.
they
have
come
up
with
a
unique
definition
of
willfulness
in
the
criminal
tax
statutes
and
they
have
applied
it
only
to
the
people
they
consider
to
be
tax
protesters.
that
is
unfair.
that
is
improper.
absolutely.
that
is
one
of
our
complaints
about
the
buckner-cheek
doctrine.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
the
rule
is
expressly
designed
to
deal
with
tax
protesters,
and
in
fact
it
has
been
applied
only
in
tax-protester
cases.
and
i
cite
in
our
brief
some
seventh
circuit
traditional
tax-evasion
cases
in
which
the
seventh
circuit
applies
the
subjective
standard.
they
don't
require...
a
person
defends
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
says
i
didn't
know
that
bribes
were
income
or
i
didn't
know
that
this
payment
to
me,
the
return
of
capital,
was
income.
issues
like
that.
the
seventh
circuit
does
not
require
that
the
defendant
establish
that
those
ideas
are
objectively
reasonable.
it
is
only
in
tax
protesters.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
that's
another
unfairness
of
this
doctrine.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
yes,
sir,
it
is.
it
is.
we
even
put
it
in
the
nature
of
a
first
amendment
gloss
on
the
issue
in
our
cert.
petition.
a
doctrine
which
is--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--no,
i
think
it
is
fairly
subsumed
in
our
issues,
because
the
buckner-cheek
doctrine
expressly,
expressly...
the
seventh
circuit
said
we
are...
have
to
deal
with
annoying
tax
protesters.
that
is
their
term,
annoying
tax
protesters.
thorns
in
the
side
of
the
federal
judiciary,
the
seventh
circuit
calls
these
annoying
tax
protesters.
well,
i
would
expect
a
federal
judiciary
has
developed
a
thick
enough
hide
to
be
able
to
tolerate
these
annoying
thorns.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
have
john
cheek
treated
like
any
other
tax-evasion
defendant
in
the
seventh
circuit,
like
any
other
tax-evasion
defendant
anywhere
else
in
the
country.
and
that
is
if
he
can
establish
his
bona
fides
to
a
jury,
if
he
can
show
the
jury
that
he
was...
had
a
sincere
and
good-faith
misunderstanding
of
his
duties
under
the
tax
law,
he
has
negated
willfulness
and
he
is
entitled
to
be
acquitted.
and
to
be
sure,
the
government
is
going
to
collect
its
taxes.
they
are
going
to
collect
civil
penalties,
and
so
forth.
but
they
should
not
be
able
to
convict
him
of
a
criminal
offense
unless
they
show
he
acted
willfully.
and
under
this
court's
rulings
he
did
not
act
wilfully
if
he
had
a
good-faith
misunderstanding
of
his
duty.
and
we're...
all
we
are
asking
is
tha
he
permitted
to
have
a
jury
make
that
judgment.
and
there
is
nothing
more
fundamental,
i
think,
in
our
criminal
justice
system
than
the
notion
that
the
issue
of
criminal
intent
is
one
for
the
jury.
it's
not
one
for
the
seventh
circuit,
it
is
not
one
that
ignores
in
all
situations
the
genesis
of
a
defendant's
claimed
misunderstanding.
cheek
went
to
seminars.
he
had
lawyers
tell
him
this
stuff.
he
did
not
act
with
criminal
intent,
and
he
never
got
the
opportunity
because
of
buckner-cheek
to
have
a
jury
pass
on
it.
that's
really
all
we
are
asking.
and
i
think
that
the
government's
position
would
represent
a
radical
departure
from
subtle
law
going
back
though
murdock,
going
back
through
bishop,
the
cases
we
cite
in
our
brief.
but
i
think
to
disrupt,
to
unsettle
the
law
on
such
a
fundamental
element
as
the
need
for
a
jury
to
pass
on
criminal
intent
simply
because
of
the
occasional
john
cheeks
of
the
world
is...
is
unfair
and
it
is
unwise
on
the
part
of
the
government.
the
government
does
not
need
to
win
this
case.
they
don't
need
it
to
enforce
the
tax
laws.
they
don't
need
it
in
the
other
circuits.
and
this
court
should
not,
on
this
kind
of
a
showing
by
the
government,
depart
from
57
years
of
settled
law
under
the
criminal
justice
system.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
your
honor,
the
government
is
taking
the
position
that
no
one
who
possesses
the
belief
that
wages
are
not
income
can
ever
be
not
guilty.
they
are
taking
the
position
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
a
lawyer
tells
you
that,
as
happened
in
john
cheek's
case,
or
an
accountant
tells
you
that.
it
wouldn't
matter,
because
the
government
says
the
content
of
that
belief
is
on
this
forbidden
list.
mr.
william
r.
coulson
john
cheek
had
lawyers
tell
him
that
under
the
internal
revenue
code
wages
were
not
income.
did
he
know
his
legal
duty?
don't
we
want
to
encourage
people
to
seek
advice
from
lawyers
and
accountants
on
the
tax
laws?
mr.
william
r.
coulson
the
government,
i
think,
exaggerates
the
significance
of
that
evidence.
in
any
event,
it
is
my
position
that
that
is
a
question
for
the
jury.
the
jury
is
entitled
to
all
of
this
information
on
what
cheek
did
and
didn't
do,
and
what
he
was
told,
and
what
he
really
understood
and
what
he
claimed
he
understood.
that
is
an
individualized
jury
determination
which
the
government
seeks
to
take
from
the
jury
in
this
case
and
in
all
other
cases,
because
cheek's
particular
belief
or
misunderstanding
is
on
this
forbidden
list.
that
makes
no
sense.
if
the
government
is
as
confident,
as
mr.
kneedler
seems
to
be
here,
that
cheek
is
clearly
guilty,
he
is
clearly
a
sham,
then
why
don't,
why
are
they
afraid
to
let
a
jury
decide
under
the
murdock
instruction?
why
do
they
need
the
helping
hand
of
buckner-cheek,
which
says
the
jury
has
to
find
that
it's
objectively
reasonable.
and
under
buckner-cheek
that
is
a
jury
determination
unless
it
is
on
the
forbidden
list.
it
makes
no
sense
in
jurisprudence.
i
am
not
abandoning
this...
i
don't
like
the
word
abandon.
i
don't
feel
that
i
am
abandoning
the
argument
on
its
unconstitutionality.
i
don't
think
it
is
an
issue
in
mr.
cheek's
case.
he
had
all
these
crazy
beliefs,
wages
are
not
income,
the
income
tax
is
voluntary.
to
be
sure,
wrong
beliefs.
i
am
not
here
to
defend
those
beliefs
on
the
merits,
but
those
are
statutory
beliefs.
and
he
was
told
that
that
was
the
state
of
the
law
by
attorneys
at
seminars,
and
he
obviously
is
not
a
sophisticated
man.
and
note,
this
court
and
the
government
cannot
say
that
a
person
in
mr.
cheek's
position
as
a
matter
of
law
could
not
have
been
mistaken.
yet
that's
the
position
the
government
is
urging.
all
we
are
asking
is
that
mr.
cheek
be
permitted
to
present
that
to
a
jury.
if
the
jury
thinks
he
is
a
phoney
they
will
convict
him.
if
they
think
he
is
sincere
they
should
acquit
him.
and
the
government
can
get
its
penalties
and
fines--
mr.
william
r.
coulson
--right.
it's
a
factor
the
jury
can
consider,
in
addition
to
all
the
other
factors,
the
genesis
and
so
forth.
a
defendant
like
cheek--
