mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
criminal
tax
statutes,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
spies
case,
is
to
induce
the
prompt
fulfillment
of
every
duty
under
the
tax
laws.
at
the
same
time
the
court
has
understood
congress
not
to
want
to
punish
what
it
termed
innocent
errors
made
despite
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care
in
trying
to
comply
with
the
complex
tax
code,
those
provisions
that
are
complex.
and
this
court
has
construed
that
criminal
tax
statute
in
a
line
of
cases
that
seek
to
give
effect
to
both
of
those
purposes,
in
particular
as
the
court
stated
in
bishop,
and
i
quote,
"it
has
construed
the
term
willfully
in
a
way
that
implements
the
intent
of
congress
to
construct
penalties
that
separate
the
purposeful
tax
violator
on
the
one
hand
from
the
well-meaning
but
easily
confused
mass
of
taxpayers
on
the
other."
in
this
case
petitioner
cheek
is
far
removed
from
the
category
of
innocent
but
well
meaning
class
of
categories,
those
seeking
to
comply
with
the
sometimes
complex
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
he
didn't
commit
innocent
errors
in...
in
connection
with
such
complex
provisions.
despite
his
awareness
of
the
basic
requirements
of
the
code,
he
declined,
refused
to
comply
with
the
most
basic
and
universally
applicable
provisions
of
the
code.
he
declined
to
file
tax
returns,
and
he
declined
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
the
point
i
am
making,
sir...
chief
justice,
is
the
fact
that
the
most
basic
obligations
in
the
tax
code
that
are
at
issue
here,
the
duty
to
file
a
return
and
the
duty
to
acknowledge
that
wages
are
taxable
income,
a
belief
that
a
person
doesn't
have
to
comply
with
those
provisions
is
not
objectively
reasonable.
the
seventh
circuit
was
addressing
a
category
of...
of
assertions
in
this
case--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
was
using
the
word
innocent
in
a...
in
a
different
way,
of
somebody
who
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
what
is
required
in
this
case,
it's
our
position
that,
generally
as
the
court
said
in
bishop
and
pomponio,
that
the
government
must
prove
an
intentional
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty,
which
is
the
gloss
that
the
court
has
put
on
the
word
willfully
under
the
tax
statutes.
a
known
legal
duty
requires
awareness
of
the
duty.
here
there's
no
question
that
mr.
cheek
was
aware
of
his
duty
under
the
tax
laws
to
file
a
return.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
subsequently
though,
justice
scalia,
in
pomponio
the
court
described
what
it
meant
by
the
phrase
evil
motive
in
prior
cases.
what
it
meant...
what
it
said
was
we
meant
by
that
nothing
more
than
intentional
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty.
and
that
was
the
precise
question
presented
on
pomponio.
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the
legal
question,
perhaps
that
is
true.
i
would
like
to
say,
though,
that
the
tax
seminars
and
what
not
that
he
says
he
attended
were
in
1980.
from
then
on
his
submissions
to
the
irs
and
his
legal
arguments
about
the
sixteenth
amendment
and
other
legal
objections
to
the
tax
system
appear...
for
all
that
appears
to
be
self-generated
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
understand,
i
understand.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it's...
it's...
it's
one
place
in
the
case
that
i
think
it's
useful,
productive
to
focus
upon.
known...
the
term
knowledge
as
used
in
this
court's
decision
in
bailey
and
as
the
model
penal
code
describes
the
word
knowledge,
it
uses
that
in
terms
of
awareness,
cognition.
is
the
actor
aware
of
the
attendant
circumstances,
where
the
attendant
circumstances
that
have
to
be
shown
are
the
state
of
the
law,
where,
in
this
case
the
internal
revenue
code
requirements,
awareness
of
what
the
internal
revenue
code
requires
is
an
element
of
the
offense.
but
once
he
is
aware
of
what
the
law
requires,
but
disagrees
with,
as
i
think
it's
only
fair
to
say
mr.
cheek
does
in
this
case,
disagrees
with
the
code
either
because
he
thinks
it
is
unconstitutional
or
because
the
irs'
construction
of
it
is
wrong,
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
most
of
his
arguments
in
this
case
are
constitutionally
based,
that
the
sixteenth
amendment
was
not
properly
ratified,
or
that...
that
this
tax
is
a
direct
tax
that
has
to
be
apportioned
among
the
states,
which
is
just
simply
wrong
under
pollock--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
understood
him
to
be
abandoning
that
as
well,
although
i
would
like
to
point
out
that...
that
even
the
courts
that
have
adopted
the
purely
subject
standard
for
claims
to
a
belief
that
income...
that
a
certain
duty
under
the
code
is
not
required,
it's
purely
subjective.
those
courts
have
all
said
that
a
belief
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
is
not
a
defense.
and
there
is
a
statutory
basis
for
that,
because
both
7201
and
7203
refer
to
evading
titles
imposed
by
this
title,
or
failing
to
perform
a
duty
required
by
this
title,
which
suggests
all
you
look
to
is
the
title...
is
the
statute,
rather
than
whether
the
constitution
might
trump
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
but
it
was
not...
it
was
not
a
claim
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
what
he
was
claiming
was
a
constitutional
privilege
from
having
to
furnish
the
information.
it
was
not
a
claim
that
congress
did
not
have
the
authority
to
enact
such
a
statute
in
the
first
place.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
it's...
first
of
all,
i
think
when...
when
that
involves
someone
who
was
summoned
to
furnish
information
to
the
irs,
i
think
it's
fair
to
attribute
to
congress
an
intent
to
comply
with
the
fifth
amendment
when
a
person
is
requested
for
information.
and
so
whether
a
person
has
a
duty...
a
duty
to
comply
in
those
circumstances,
i
think
there
isn't
a
clash
between
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
statute.
the
way
you
are
claiming
that
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional
in
the
sense
that
congress
didn't
even
have
authority
to
enact
it
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that's...
i
think
that's
quite
a
different
sort
of
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
because
i
think
we
would
be
reduced
to
chaos
if...
if
individual
citizens
could
take
it
upon
themselves
to
make,
as
one
court
of
appeals
put
in
response
to
this
very
argument,
to
make
individualized
determinations
of
constitutionality.
there
is
a
presumption
of
constitutionality.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it...
it
could,
but
i
think
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
intended
to
encourage
disobedience
of
the
statutes
it
enacted
by
claims
that
those
statutes
are...
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
this
court...
this
court
in
particular
in
murdock
and
in
subsequent
cases.
and
in
murdock
the
court
says
the,
said
that
the
word
willfully
has
to
be
construed
in
light
of
its
context
in
the
tax
code
and
the
purposes
of
the
tax
code.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
we
do
acknowledge
the
existence
of
a
certain
implied
defense
of
mistake
of
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we...
it
must
be
shown
that
he
was
aware
of
his
legal
duty,
a
known
legal
duty
in
that
sense.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
that
is
correct.
but
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i
think
that
he
is.
he's
aware
in
the
sense
that
is
relevant
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
law.
the
criminal
law
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--for
purposes
of
triggering
the
awareness
of
the
requirements
of
the
law,
yes.
now
that
is
where
the
defense
of
objective...
objectively
reasonable
belief
in
the
validity
of
his
legal
position
kicks
in.
of
course,
if
the
court...
if
the
court
agrees
with
his
position
on
the
merits
that
wages
aren't
income,
then
you
don't
need
the
willfulness
standard.
he
simply
hasn't
committed
a
violation
of
the
act.
but...
but...
so
we
are
assuming
that
his
view
of
the
law
is
incorrect.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
although,
justice
scalia,
we
would
be
delighted
with
a
statement
by
this
court
that
would
put
to
rest
once
and
for
all
the
proposition
that
wages
are
not
income.
it
may
seem
amusing
here,
but
it
is...
it
is
a
problem
with
an
assertion
like
this
being
made
in
cases
in
this
day
and
age.
irs
informs
me
that
116
million
tax
returns
were
filed
last
year
with
w-2's
attached
to
them,
meaning
that
those
were
tax
forms
filed
by
wage
earners.
people
know
in
this
country
that
wages
are
income,
and
the
idea
that
a
defense
like
this
should
be
presented
to
the
jury,
i
think
i
would
do
nothing
but
promote
disrespect
for
the
tax
laws,
when
what
the
court
should
be
doing
in
construing
willfully
is
promoting
the
duty
to
comply
with
the
tax
laws.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
your
point...
your
question
raises
two
points.
one
is
advised
by
counsel.
there
is...
there--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--here
i
should
put
out...
point
out
petitioner
did
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he's
not
claiming
he
was
advised...
it's
not
the
classic
advice
of
counsel
defense,
is
the
only
point
that
i
am
making.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
as
long
as
that
is
a
reasonable
belief,
a
plausible
belief,
and
i
think
there
should
be
considerable
latitude
for
a
court
to
recognize
arguments
such
as
that.
but
on
the
other
hand
if
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if...
if
he
has...
he
is
aware
of
the
regulation,
we...
we
therefore
have
shown
the
knowledge--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
the
statute
is
written
terms...
in
terms
of,
for
example,
in
terms
of
filing
returns.
it
refers
to
returns
that
are
required
by
this
statute,
or
regulations
under
it,
in
fact.
so
the
regulations
reflect
irs'
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
has
to
be
plausible
on
an
objective
basis.
i
mean,
there
is
a
threshold--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
may
all...
i
mean,
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
he
will
show...
that
he
would
be
able
to
show
a
lack
of
knowledge.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
instruction
is
that
we
have
to
show
that
there
was
a
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty.
he
had
to
know
that
the
internal
revenue
code
required
him
to
file
a
tax
return,
and
that
wages
are
income
under
the
internal
revenue
code
as
construed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
then,
no
matter
who
it
is,
this
is
a
ruling...
this
is
a
determination
that
that
is
not
an
acceptable
basis
for
declining
to
comply
with
the
tax
code.
because
the
rule
we're
proposing
is
not
that...
doesn't
turn
on
somebody's
ability
to
do
legal
research
on
the
question.
it
is
simply
that
as
a
matter
of
judgment...
and
what
is
a
reasonable
legal
argument
is
quintessentially
a
legal
determination,
that
that's
simply...
that's
simply
frivolous.
and
in
fact
mr.
cheek's
lawyer
was,
or
mr.
cheek
was
assessed
penalties
in
his
civil
case
for
making
that
precise
argument
in
the
courts.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
the
affirmative
case
that
we
must
show
is
that
it
was
a
known
legal
duty
in
the
sense
that
he
had
to
be
aware
that
he
was
required
by
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
affirmative
defense
then
kicks
in.
it
is
available
to
him,
not
in...
not
in
the
hypothetical
justice
kennedy
posited
of
the...
the
janitor
believing
that
wages
aren't
income.
we
are
saying
that
is
not
objectively
reasonable
across
the
board.
that
is
not
individually--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--then
in
that
situation
i
think
it
would...
it
would
not
be
objectively
reasonable
to
challenge
the
regulation.
at
some
point
taxpayers
have
to
recognize
that
their
disagreements
with
the
irs
have
become
settled
by
this
court,
or
once
again
we
would
be
encouraging
disrespect
not
only
for
the
internal
revenue
code,
but
for...
but
for
the
judicial
process.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
a
question
justice
scalia
mentioned
earlier,
that
mr.
cheek
has
conceded
that
constitutional
objections
to
the
internal
revenue
code
are
not...
are
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
defense,
but
he
had
other
objections.
in
fact
his
only
other
objection,
as
i
understand
it,
was
the
claim
that
wages
are
not
income.
if
you
look
at
his
testimony
in
this
case,
and
as
this
argument
has
been
presented
in
other
cases,
that
is...
that
has
also
been
presented
as
a
constitutional
argument,
that
wages
involve
an
equal
exchange
of
labor
for
compensation.
there
is
no
gain
or
profit,
therefore
it
can't
be
taxed.
it's
in
effect
a
tax
of
his
property,
which
is
a
direct
tax
which
can't
be
taxed
under
the
sixteenth
amendment.
so
even
that
argument,
as
it
has
traditionally
been
interpreted,
or
traditionally...
traditionally
been
presented
and
as
it
has
been
presented
by
mr.
cheek
in
this
case,
is
at
bottom
a
constitutional
objection
and
falls
in
that
same
category.
but
there
is
another
point
i
would
like
to
make
about
that.
petitioner
does
not
suggest
that
that
argument
is
grounded
in
anything
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
other
aspects
of
his
testimony
in
this
case
were
based
on
his...
on
a
set
of
beliefs
that
were
not
grounded
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
he
referred
to
his...
to
his
wages
as
property
over
which
he
had
inalienable
rights,
citing
and
furnishing
the
irs
the
declaration
of
independence.
he
had
economic
theories
about
equal
exchanges
of
his
labor
for
income.
those
may
be
theories,
those
may
be
abstract
beliefs,
but
they
are
not
the
sort
of
beliefs,
as
this
court
made
perfectly
clear
in
reynolds
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
all
we
have
to
show.
the
defendant
then
may
come
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
accept...
we
accept
the
mistake
of
law
defense
to
that
extent.
but
i
think
the
chief
justice
made
an
important
point
very
early
in
the
argument,
and
that
is
that
as
a
general
matter
in
the
criminal
law,
mistake
of
law
is
not
even
a
defense
at
all.
so
we
are
operating
in
a
context
in
which
we
are
all...
there
is
already
an
exception
to
the
general
principle
under
the
criminal
law
that
mistake
of
law
is
not
a
defense.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
wasn't
invented...
it
wasn't
invented
in
so
many
words
by
congress
either.
it
was...
it
came
from
this
court...
from
this
court's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
attempting
to...
but,
by
the
same...
but
i
think
that
that
points
out
why
this
court
should
hold
that
defense
within
reasonable
limits.
if...
if--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
i
did
not
mean...
i
am
sorry
if
i
was
suggesting
i
was
denigrating.
all
i
was
saying
is
that
it
needs
the
objective
reasonableness
limitation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
but
that
is...
that
is
an
interpretation
this
court
put
on
the
word
willfully.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
correct,
but
we
do
recognize
that
murdock
did...
did
recognize
it
in
a
little
bit
broader
breadth
for
defense
of
mistake
of
law
there.
it
was
quite...
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
valid
fifth
amendment
claim
at
the
time
that
murdock
declined
to
furnish
the
information.
but...
but
because
that
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
do,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right.
but
we
think
that
the
limitation
the
seventh
circuit
has
put
on
it
in
terms
of
the
objectively
reasonable
limitation
is
a
critical
limitation,
because
it
would--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--by...
by
the
requirement
of
knowledge.
he
has
to,
we
have
to
show
in
order
to
sustain
a
conviction
as
part
of
our
affirmative
case
that
he
was
aware
of
the
legal
duty
imposed
by
the
code.
and
if
he
relies
on
a
defense
that...
or
an
interpretation
of
the
code,
notwithstanding
his
knowledge,
that
is
objectively
reasonable,
he,
like
anyone
else,
would
benefit
from
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
fact
what
he
is
saying
in
this
case
is
what
comes
down
to
a
natural
law
objection.
in
my
view
of
what
wages
are,
they
aren't...
there's
no
gain
or
profit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
he
has
an
argument--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
suppose
one
could
look
at
it
that
way,
but
i
think...
but
he
certainly
has
a
duty
of
what
the
law
says,
the
law
being
the
statute
and
the
regulations
that
the
commissioner
is
authorized...
or
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
promulgate.
that...
that's
the
classic
place
that
people
look
for
what
the
law
is
when
they
are
trying
to
comport
their
behavior
to
the
requirements
of
the
law.
they
look
to
the
law,
the
statute,
and
the
regulations
issued
by
the
agency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
he
has
to
know
the...
i
don't
think
he
has
to
know
the...
he
doesn't
have
to
know
the
text
of
the
statute.
i
think
he
has
to
know
the
legal
duty.
if
we
can
show
that,
if
we...
which
is
the
phrase
from
pomponio,--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--legal
duty
traces
from
the
statute.
if
the
statute
says,
as
this
one
does,
you
shall
file
a
tax
return
if
you
have
income
above
a
certain
amount,
and
you
know
of
that
legal
requirement,
then
you
have
to...
then
you
have
to
file
it.
and
if
the
irs
has
given
content
to
that
statutory
requirement
in
regulations,
and
you
disagree
with
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
irs,
and
if
your
disagreement
is
objectively
reasonable
then
you
haven't
committed
a
willful
offense.
but
i
think
it's
important
for...
when
a
person
is
claiming
a
mistake
of
law
defense,
that
defense
has
to
be
grounded
in
the
statute
that
he
is
challenging.
he
has
to
be
able
to
say,
using
traditional
legal
tools,
no,
income
doesn't
include
wages.
he
has
to...
it
has
to
be
grounded
in
the
act
that
he
is
claiming
to
have
been
mistaken
about.
nothing
in
this
case
remotely
approached
that.
in
fact,
when
you
look
at
the
definition
of
gross
income
under
the
internal
revenue
code
it
refers
to
income
from
whatever
source
derived,
specifically
including
in
the
first
itemization
compensation
for
services.
it
strikes
me
as
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we...
we
do
agree
that
the
arguments
that
have
been,
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that...
that's
correct.
now
again,
most
of
those
are
constitutional
arguments,
which
mr.
cheek
concedes
are
not
a
valid
defense.
and
the
argument
that
wages
aren't
income,
again,
i
think
that,
given
the
virtually
universal
compliance
by
taxpayers
in
this
country
with
the
requirement
to
file
tax
returns
on
the
understanding
that
wages
are
income,
that
is
not
an
objectively
reasonable
belief
in
the
matter
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
our...
our
principal
submission
is
that
it
is
a
question
of
law,
like
the
question
of
materiality
in
a
false
statement
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
absolutely.
and
the
jury...
the
judge
did
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
one
approach
would
be
for
the
judge
to
say
it's
objectively
reasonable,
and
then
not
even
instruct
the
jury
on
the
question.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
murdock,
that
is
exactly
the
procedural
approach
the
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
court
decided
it.
what
the
court
said
is
because
the
law
was
uncertain
at
the
time
that
he
declined
to
furnish
the
information,
it
was
improper
for
the
judge
to
in
effect
instruct
the
jury
that
murdock's
belief
was
so
unreasonable
and
ill
founded...
the
words
the
court
used...
to
amount
to
willfulness.
but
the
clear
implication,
the
other
side
of
what
the
court
was
saying,
is
if
the...
if
that
question
had
been
settled,
as
it
subsequently
was
by
this
court,
if
that
question
had
been
settled
by
this
court
at
the
time
that
murdock
acted,
then
the
district
court
should
not
have
submitted
that
to
the
jury
at
all.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that
would
be...
that
would
be
one
appropriate
approach.
and
as
i
say,
that
has
a
lot
of
support
in
murdock.
that
is
i
think
what
the
court
contemplated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
individualized
determination,
justice
scalia,
comes
in
the
knowing
requirement.
once
again
i
would
like
to
stress
we
have
to
show
intentional
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty,
and
the
person--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--our
second
position
in
the
case
is
that
there
may
be
cases
in
which
it
would
be
proper
to
submit
to
the
jury,
but
these
beliefs
in
this
case
are
unreasonable...
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
law
or
unavailable
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that...
that's
correct,
so
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
that.
it
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
question
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think...
i
think
murdock
would
support
that
approach,
but
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--took
several
of
the
beliefs
away
from
the
jury.
took
away...
took
away
the
argument
that
the
belief
that
the
tax
code
is
unconstitutional--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
i
think
the
chief
justice
has
put
his
finger
on
it.
i
think
that
there
was
a
tension
between
the
court's
principal
instructions
and
the
court's
attempt
to
explain
mr.
chief's
theory
of
the
defense,
even
though
his
theory
was
not...
was
not
a
valid
one.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
again,
i
think
the
court
gave
a
clear
answer,
and
we
think
that
this
court
should
give
a
clear
answer.
and
that
is
that
at
least
the
particular
beliefs
that
mr.
cheek
was
offering
here
are
not
objectively
reasonable
as
a
matter
of
law,
either
on
the
theory
that
this
is
always
a
question
for
the
judge,
which
was
properly
exercised
here,
in
effect,
or
that
at
least
in
this
case
these
beliefs
were
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
would
like
to
go
back
again
though
to
stress
that
this
court
has
taken
upon...
has
had
to
take
upon
itself
the
construction
of
the
term
willfully
in
a
way
that
furthers
the
policies
of
the
tax
statutes.
and
we
think
that
a
requirement
that
a
jury
acquit
a
defendant
as
long
as
it
believes...
as
long
as
he
convinces
them
that
he
subjectively
believed
in
his
cause,
even
if
that
cause
has
no
support
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
that
that
would
promote
disrespect
for
the
law,
not,
just
among
the
particular
category
of
people
who
are
sometimes
categorized
as
tax
protesters,
but
the
rest
of
us
who
are
taxpayers.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
there
are
civil
penalties,
but
here
we
had
somebody...
and
this
case
really...
really
shows
what,
the
mischief
of
the
contrary
rule.
somebody
who
has
had
four
cases
thrown
out
of
court,
making
these
arguments
that
they
are
frivolous.
somebody
who
has
been
written
by
the
internal
revenue
code...
written
to
by
the
internal...
irs,
telling
him
that
he
has
to
file
tax
returns.
somebody
who
filed
tax
returns
for
10
years,
and
he
is
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
and
say
i
believed
i
didn't
have
to.
that's
not
the
way
our
tax
system
operates.
citizens
in
this
country
understand
their
legal
duties
under
the
tax
code.
and
at
least
focusing
on
the
particular
objections
to
the
tax
code
here,
we
think
it
is
proper
for
the
court
to
say
that
this
defense
is
unavailable.
a
contrary
rule
would
come
into
tension
with
reynolds
and
oregon
department
of
employment
securities.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
a
difference
between
knowledge
and
belief.
it's
highlighted...
it's
highlighted
by
the
example
of
where
this
court
has
ruled
on
the
precise
question.
he
certainly
knows
what
the
law
is
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
he
simply
doesn't
believe
it.
well,
belief
in
the
way...
in
that
sense
is
not
a
belief
coming
from
trying
to
comply
with
the
law.
it's
a
belief...
it's
a
subjective
abstract
belief
about
what
the
law
ought
to
be.
and
that
defense,
we
submit,
under
the
tax
code
is
not
available.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
law
in
the
first
instance
is
what
congress
says
it
is.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
this
court
has
to
have
ruled
before
somebody
has
to
comply
with
the
tax
code.
it
is
what...
the
law
that
congress
enacted.
