mr.
allain
f.
hardin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
moragne
v.
states
marine
lines
this
court
recognized
the
general
maritime
wrongful
death
cause
of
action.
in
sea-land
services
v.
gaudet
this
court
established
the
damages
allowed
thereunder.
in
this
case
the
court
has
the
opportunity
to
address
and
define
the
beneficiaries
who
may
recover
under
this
cause
of
action.
additionally,
the
court
has
the
opportunity
to
define
what
damages
are
allowed
under
a
general
maritime
survival
action.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
correct,
your
honor.
the
facts
of
this
case
involve
the
death
of
a
24-year-old
seaman
who
was
horrendously
killed
off
the
coast
of
the
state
of
washington.
he
was
survived
only
by
his
parents.
there
was
no
issue
or
wife.
unseaworthiness
was
found
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
jones
act
negligence
was
assessed.
the
first
issue
that
this
court
must
address
is
whether
or
not
a
dependency
must
be
established
by
the
parents
before
they
have
a
claim
for
loss
of
society
damages.
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
an
estate
under
a
survival
action
has
a
claim
for
decedent's
economic
loss
when
not
otherwise
recovered.
the
context
of
this
case
must
be
remembered
because
in
moragne
what
the
court
did
was
to
bring
into
the
20th
century
the
maritime
wrongful
death
cause
of
action.
what
it
has
also
done
by
that
case
is
to
foreclose
state
remedies
in
the
maritime
jurisdiction.
before
that
wasn't
the
case.
and
this
takes
on
great
importance
when
it
comes
to
deaths
that
result
in
territorial
waters,
because
state
remedies
no
longer
apply.
in
fact,
those
have
been
foreclosed.
a
case
that
is
of
significance
in
this
area
is
foremost
v.
richardson,
where
it
was
held
that
if
two
pleasure
boats
in
a
collision
on
the
emite
river
in
the
state
of
louisiana
was
held
to
fall
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction.
so
that
death
cases
on...
in
territorial
waters,
the
damages
are
established
by
this
court.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
no,
i
think
it's
impossible,
your
honor,
just
given
the
contradictory
nature
of
the
various
statutes.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
now
that
there
is
a
federal
wrongful
death
cause
of
action
in
the
maritime
law,
state
remedies
no
longer
apply
in
that
area.
and
it
takes...
it
is
significant.
it
is
very
significant,
because
in
the
old
days
when
the
harrisburg
was
good
law,
state
remedies
would
apply.
in
this
particular
case
we
are
dealing
with
a
jones
act
seaman,
and
what
i
am
trying
to
show,
and
the
first
issue
i
would
like
to
address,
is
whether
parents
must
establish
financial
dependency.
the
fifth
circuit
says
they
must.
i
submit
that
that
is
an
incorrect
decision,
and
the
basis
being
first
of
all--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--yes,
your
honor.
i
am
not
speaking
of
the
survival
action
at
this
point.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
your
honor,
i...
i
am.
i
was
getting
to
the
dependency
issue
first.
but
to
respond
to
your
question,
it's
been
universally
recognized
by
the
courts
of
appeals;
the
underlying
courts
have
recognized
it
also.
not
to
recognize
it
would
be
devastating
to
many
claims,
because
when
you
are
talking
about
nonseamen,
you
are
talking
about
pain
and
suffering
being
done
away
with,
medical
expenses
prior
to
death--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--no,
the
question
was
directed
to
the
survival
action,
and
that
was
what
i
was
addressing.
congress
has
not
spoken
in
this
area,
and
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
authority
it
has
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction,
and
it
has
exercised
that
jurisdiction
before,
for
example
in
moragne
and
in
gaudet.
to
get
to
the
point--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--and
also
in
higginbotham,
your
honor.
but
to
get
to
the
point
of
the
wrongful
death
on
the
statutory...
that
is
on
the
statutory
guides
that
are
to
be
utilized,
the
point
i
am
making
here
is
that
dependency
does
not
have
to
be
established
in
order
to
have
a
claim
under
dohsa
or
under
the
jones
act.
dependency
is
an
adjective,
appears
before
next
of
kin
and
relatives.
it
does
not
appear
before
parents.
and
i
think
congress
had
the
intention
of
allowing
parents
to
have
a
recovery
even
if
they
were
not
dependent.
for
example,
in
this
very
case
mrs.
miles
had
an
award
of
$7,800
even
though
she
was
not
dependent.
the
other--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--correct,
your
honor.
i...
i'm
in
the
wrongful
death
area,
not
the
survival
action.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
it's
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
it's
on
page
a-1,
and
the
jones
act
is
referred
to
on
the
subsequent
pages,
and
it
applies
fela,
f-e-l-a.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
i
am
relying
on
that
very
language.
what
has
happened
is
the
lower
court
has
said
in
order
to
claim
loss
of
society
damages,
dependency
has
to
be
established.
i
represent
the
parents
of
a
deceased
seaman.
my
point
is
that
if
we
are
to
look
to
the
statutes
as
a
guide,
as
this
court
has
held,
then
you
will
see
that
dependency
as
an
adjective
only
comes
after
parents.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
not
at
all.
in
fact,
it
has
been
specifically
held
in
gaudet
the
distinction,
and
in
higginbotham,
that
the
distinction
was
made,
this
is
territorial
water
claim
as
opposed
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
claim.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
it
does
not
allow--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--nonpecuniary
damages
for
deaths
caused
by
negligence
of
the
ship
owner.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
but
you
would,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
gaudet,
what
it
did
was
it
recognized
the
damages
of
loss
of
society
in
the
general
maritime
law.
that
action
applies
to
seamen
on
the
unseaworthiness
claim,
as
opposed
to
his
jones
act
claim
which
comes
on
the
law
side
of
the
court.
but
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
as
far
as
dependency,
i
would
submit
that
it's
inappropriate
to
use
that
as
a
requirement,
since
loss
of
society
damages
are
nonfinancially
based.
they
don't
arise
from
any
financial
connection
with
the
decedent.
they
are...
they
speak
directly
to
the
bonds
that
would
take
place
between
family
members.
they
exist--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--there
is
some,
your
honor.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
well,
if
it's
a
matter
to
quantify,
then
that
may
very
well
go
to
the
issue
of
damages,
as
to
the
amount,
as
to
what
is
the
relationship
between
that
person
and
the
decedent.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
your
honor,
i
submit
that
there
is
a
tremendous
loss
of
society.
this
is
the
youngest
child
of
this
lady.
there
was
a
close
bond
that
existed
between
the
two.
when
he
came
back
to
the
city
they
would...
he
would
stay
there.
your
honor,
they
are
real
damages.
i
agree
that
a
line
has
to
be
drawn,
and
i
am
not
saying
here
to
extend
it
to
whoever
you
could
make
up
or
include
as
a
person
that
would
have
some
connection--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--they
would
not
be,
unless
they
are
dependent.
because
i
am
saying
to
apply
the
statutes,
that
is
dohsa
and
the
jones
act,
as
the
guides.
if
the
brothers
and
sisters
are
nondependent,
they
would
not
qualify
for
loss
of
society
damages.
however,
parents
don't
have
a
dependency
requirement.
and
i
am
saying
draw
the
line
like
congress
drew
the
line.
that
is
all
i
am
asking.
i
am
not
here
for
mothers-in-laws,
or
brother
and...
or
nondependent
brothers
and
sisters,
or
aunts
and
uncles.
in
fact
i
have
got
a
class
that
i
view
is
more
manageable
than
a
dependency.
a
mother-in-law
could
be
dependent
upon
the
deceased
seaman,
and
she
would
have
a
claim
for
loss
of
society
damages.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
it
is
clearly
established
that
they
may
not.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
that
is
correct.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
but
there
has
always
been
a
traditional
separation
of
the
general
maritime
remedies
for
seamen,
and
also
the
jones
act
claim
under
the
law
court
on
the
other
side.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
well,
that's
the
direction
that
the
court
has
given,
your
honor,
that
to
use
as
a
guide
in
formulating
your
general
maritime
remedies
and
damages,
to
use
those
that
exist
on
the
law
side
of
the
court.
and
to
use
that
as
a
guide,
the
line
that
is
drawn
is
after
parents
when
it
comes
to
dependencies.
and
i
can't
emphasize
enough
that
i
have
the
restrictive
class,
because
to
say
that
someone
is
dependent
is
to
say
well,
it's
based
upon
a
financial
relationship.
verdicts
are
going
to
be
unreasonable,
inconsistent,
and
unfair
if
that
is
the
criteria
upon
which
loss
of
society
damages
are
to
be
awarded.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
your
honor--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--your
honor,
i
think
the
point
that
you
have...
that
you
are
bringing
out
is
that
the
jones
act
has
preempted
the
general
maritime
law.
that
has
specifically
been
held
by
this
court,
for
example
in
the
american
export
lines
v.
alvez,
that
it
does
not.
that
they
do
not
preempt.
that
it
is
better
to
give
the
remedy
than
to
foreclose
it
if
there
is
no
inflexible
rules--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--not
under
these
exact
circumstances,
your
honor.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
right.
and
the
point
i
would
make
in
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
a
jones
act
claim
on
one
hand,
but
it
has
always
been
the
practice,
and
it
has
been
what
has
been
taking
place
in
the
lower
courts,
is
that
there
is
likewise
a
general
maritime
claim
based
upon
unseaworthiness.
and
i
think
the
point
has
to
be
brought
home
this
way.
the
court,
in
overruling
the
harrisburg,
addressed
directly
that
they
were
applying
this
new
cause
of
action
to
seamen.
the
harrisburg
involved
the
death
of
a
seaman
in
territorial
waters.
and
the
respondents
argue,
well,
then...
well,
no,
in
moragne,
by
overruling
the
harrisburg,
only
meant
to
apply
to
longshoremen
and
not
to
seamen.
but
why
overrule
a
case
that
dealt
directly
with
that?
it
just
doesn't
make
sense,
your
honor,
is
what
i
am
pointing
out.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
yes,
you
have,
your
honor.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
yes,
you
have.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
they
didn't
hold
that
though.
they
didn't...
your
honor,
they
did
not
address
that
issue.
what
they
said
was
i
didn't
show
dependency.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
yes
they
did.
they
spoke
in
terms
of
the
uniformity.
but--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--yes.
but
uniformity
in
this
area
cannot
be
held...
cannot
be
had,
given
the
decision
in
higginbotham.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
because
it...
it's
under
the
general
maritime
law.
that
is
where
it
is
allowed.
that
is
gaudet
applying
to
seamen.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
which
is
what
i
am
arguing
here,
that
it
should
be
applied
to
seamen,
and
that
it
shouldn't
be
a
rule
of
dependency.
gaudet...
bottom
line
on
the
gaudet
case
is
that
in
reality
it
is
a
seaman's
case,
even
though
it
was
a
longshoreman,
because
it
was
based
upon
unseaworthiness.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--i
understand
though
that
it
would
still
be
stare
decisis
as
far
as
the
court
is
concerned,
at
least
i
am
hopeful
of
that.
i
can't
say
what
the
court
is
going
to
do.
but
i
say
the
issue
has
already
been
decided.
it
is
an
unseaworthiness
claim.
the
only
reason
the
longshoreman
has
the
unseaworthiness
claim
was
because
he
was
doing
work
of
a
seaman.
so
it
doesn't
make
sense
not
to
apply
it
to
seamen,
because
it
was
a
seaman's
remedy
that
was
at
issue
there.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
no,
he
could
not.
but
he
could
utilize
territorial--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--that
is
correct.
but
he
could
utilize
state
remedies.
and
this...
when
the
court
is
fashioning
this
remedy
in
terms
of
the
seaman,
you
must
remember
that
it
also
applies
to
the
nonseaman
alike.
and
what
i
am
trying
to
emphasize
is
by
not
allowing,
by
having
no
nonpecuniary
damages,
that
is,
no
loss
of
society,
what
the
court
will
end
up
doing
if
dependency
is
the
requirement
is
for
example
the
case
i
cited,
neal
v.
barisich,
which
was
upheld
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
an
unpublished
opinion.
we
had
a
19
year
old
seaman
knocked
off
board
a
vessel
by
a
collision;
his
body
was
found
later.
and
the
only
damages
that
were
left
in
that
case
were
funeral
expenses
and
nothing
more,
because
there
was
no
dependency.
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
admiralty
law
is
all
about.
take
it
or
no--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--well,
it
goes
back...
in
admiralty
law
it
goes
back
to
the
old
principle
that
the
wrongdoer
should
not
benefit
from
his
own
wrong.
that's
the
principle--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--but
if
there
is
a
loss
of
society
damage
that
exists
in
fact--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--why
base
it
upon
dependency?
that's
not
a
good
rule,
that
i
would
submit.
it's
not
a
good
rule.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
your
honor,
to
bring
home
the
point
in
the
nonseaman
area,
there
are
cases...
there
is
a
situation
where
children,
that
is
17
through
19
years
old,
are
killed
by
another
pleasure
boater,
that
is
a
40-foot
cigarette
boat,
and
this
is
a
real
case,
rakes
over
the
top
of
the
vessel.
impact
injuries
instantly
kill
four
children
on
board
that
vessel.
under
the
law,
if
dependency
is
the
requirement,
because
they
were...
clearly
did
not
support
their
parents,
the
only
damages
that
would
be
allowed
are
the
funeral
expenses.
state
law
at
least
allowed
those
type
of
damages,
the
nonpecuniary
damages.
but
this
court,
by
creating
the
wrongful
death
remedy,
has
taken
those
state
remedies
out.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
your
honor,
you
have
held
it
in
the
language
that
was
used
in
moragne.
part
of
the
reason
for
moragne
was
to
do
away
with
the
conflicting
state
remedies.
admiralty
law
was
to
be
uniform.
the
lower
federal
courts
have
interpreted
it
that
way,
that
you
have
done
away
with...
it's
the
reversed
erie
doctrine,
is
what
it
is.
state
courts
are
required
to
apply
the
federal--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--the
case...
it
is
uniformly
held...
all
i
know
is
the
cases
that
have
been
decided.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
s.s.
helena
specifically
held
that.
the
case
i
cited,
truehart
v.
blandon,
specifically
holds
that.
neal
v.
barisich
specifically
holds
that.
and
i
think
the
lower
courts--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--yes.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
well,
it's
not
critical
to
the
element
of
the
argument.
i
am
just,
i
am
trying
to
bring
home
the
point
of
the
effect
of
this
ruling
will
have
in
the
general
maritime
law.
it
goes
beyond
just
seamen.
it
is
the
ship
owner's
position
that
the
pendency
was
what
was
required
to
be
shown,
as
per
gaudet,
simply
by
the
use
of
that
term
by
this
court.
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
dissent
in
gaudet,
there
the
organ
for
the
court
said
that
we
have
yet
to
decide
who
the
beneficiaries
are
under
this
cause
of
action.
so
that
gaudet
is
not
a
case
that
establishes
that
only
dependents
can
recover
this
item
of
damages.
and
i
have
also
cited
to
the
court
cohen
v.
virginia,
where
the
general
expressions
in
one
opinion
do
not
necessarily
control
the
very
point
when
it
comes
to
issue
in
another
case.
the
ship
owner
also
argues
that
the
jones...
that
is
that
the
jones
act
preempts.
and
i
pointed
out
that
in
the
harrisburg,
that
is
definitely
not
the
case
because
it
overruled
a
seaman's
case.
and
more
importantly,
in
moragne
the
court
addressed
the
third
anomaly.
and
the
third
anomaly
was
that
longshoremen,
who
were
relying
upon
the
unseaworthiness
claim,
which
is
a
seaman's
remedy,
were
granted
a
wrongful
death
cause
of
action
by
relying
upon
state
remedies
in
territorial
waters,
where
jones
act
seaman,
because
it
preempted
the
state
law,
was
not
allowed
a
claim.
if
a
seaman
died
strictly
from
an
unseaworthiness
condition
and
not
jones
act
negligence,
then
there
would
be
no
recovery
in
that
case.
and
the
court
in
gaudet,
when
it
was
referring
to
moragne
about
the
three
anomalies,
said
that
moragne
ended
these
anomalies.
so
clearly
the
court
was
saying
that
the
benefit
was
being
provided
to
seamen.
the
same
thing
is
addressed
in
footnote
12
of
moragne,
where
it
is
clear
from
that--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--it's
your
call.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
i
can
only
tell
you
what
the
court
said
in
gaudet,
saying
that
moragne
ended
these
anomalies.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
also,
in
american
export
lines
v.
alvez,
the
issue
of
statutory
preemption
was
addressed
directly,
and
then
it
was...
and
clearly
rejected.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
an
estate
has
a
claim
for
a
decedent's
economic
loss
when
not
recovered
by
loss
of
support.
it's
opposition
that
there
is
clearly
a
survival
action
under
the
general
maritime
law.
i
am
now
on
that
part
of
it.
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
what
the
evich
court
in
this
instance
was
trying
to
do
was
to
place
back
the
seaman,
the
basic
principle,
to
the
position
he
would
have
been
had
he
not
been
killed.
and
by
that
i
mean
is
that
had
he
lived
his
normal
life
there
would
have
been
an
estate
at
the
end
of
that
life
that
would
have
gone
to
his
beneficiaries.
and
that
is
all
the
evich
court
has
done,
is
put
that
person
back
where
he
was
before,
that
there
would
have
been
an
estate.
we
are
not
talking
about
substantial
damages.
we
are
talking
about
actually
a
small
amount.
for
example,
in
muirhead,
the
case
relied
upon
in
evich,
the
total
award
for
a
residual
estate
was
$10,000,
because
it's
net
earnings
offset
by
consumption
to
present
value.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
significant
item
in
damages.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
it
forms
an
element
of
what
was
going
to
be
generated
by
the
estate.
but
if
the
rule
to
be
applied
is
as
it
was
in
muirhead,
then
we
are
dealing
with
the
residual
estate,
which
is
after
consumption,
which
would
have
been
recovered
on
a
loss
of
support
side.
and
i
should
point
out
that
in
an
unpublished
opinion
that
decision
was
followed
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
case
no.
87-3984,
lasigne
v.
bacon.
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
justice
stevens,
i
would
only
point
you
to
a
case,
fifth
circuit,
matter
of
s.s.
helena,
529
f.
2d
744,
where
it
specifically
held
that
a
state
wrongful
death
statute
was
preempted
by
the
moragne
cause
of
action.
also
in
truehart
they
referred
to
a
supreme
court
case,
east
river
steamship,
found
in
476
u.s.--
what
i
would
respond
as
far
as
the
loss-of-society
damage
claim
is
that
the
lower
courts
have
in
fact
recognized
a
seaman's
claim
for
this
item
of
damages.
it
is
clearly
recognized
for
injuries.
what
we
are
asking
is
that
it
be
recognized
certainly
for
wrongful
deaths
under
the
general
maritime
law.
even
this
defendant
did
not
raise
that
issue
in
the
lower
court.
it
wasn't
an
issue.
the
only
issue
was
dependency,
whether
or
not
dependency
had
to
be
established
before
loss
of
society
damages
could
be
had.
also,
the
respondent
relies
upon
gillespie
and
lindgren,
but
the
commentators
have
all
pointed
out
that
those
cases
have
been
overruled
by
moragne
through
the...
the
wording
used
in
the
language
there.
the
commentators
clearly
recognize
that.
we
as
practitioners
have
recognized
it,
because
we
always,
when
we
are
dealing
with
an
admiralty
case,
is
link
up
the
general
maritime
claim
on
the
admiralty
side
of
the
court
with
the
jones
act
claim.
the
jones
act
was
passed
in
order
to
expand
seamen's
remedies,
not
to
limit
them.
it
certainly
wasn't
meant
by
congress
to
do
away
with
the
general
maritime
causes
of
action
that
a
seaman
has
under
that
area
of
the
law.
this
court
recognizes,
no
doubt,
that
seamen
are
the
wards
of
this
court,
that
it
is
better
to
give
the
remedy--
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
--your
honor,
i
disagree.
i
respectfully
disagree.
a
seaman
has
to
go
out.
he
is
under
the
command
of
the
master
at
all
times
that
he
is
on
the
vessel.
he's
subjected
to
wherever
that
vessel
goes,
wherever
the
captain
sends
it.
he
is
subjected
to
the
hazards
of
the
sea,
that
is
the
machinery
and
all
of
the
equipment
that
is
utilized
there.
it's
not
a
rule
that
should
be
done
away
with,
or
a
viewpoint
that
should
be
done
away
with.
they
are
still
under
the
orders
of
the
captain
and
must
do
what
they
are
told.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
well,
they
can't
walk
away
from
the
vessel,
your
honor.
they
cannot,
without
being
charged
with
some
criminal
conduct
that
actually
the
captain
has
the
right
to
charge
them
with,
on
their
own.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
well,
they
are
wards...
in
that
sense
they
are,
because
i
think
that
is
what
the
court
is
trying
to
do
by
saying
that,
is
to
impose
a
burden
upon
the
captain
to
watch
these
men.
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
has
done
by
saying...
by
stating
that.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
the
captain
runs
it,
your
honor.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
well,
when
that
vessel
out
there...
when
that
vessel
is
out
there
it
is
the
captain
that
operates
the
vessel,
your
honor.
mr.
allain
f.
hardin
well,
actually
it
is
interesting
because
they
are
saying
there
is
no
general
maritime
cause
of
action,
yet
justice...
judge
rubin
recognized
that
they
had
a
cause
of
action
under
general
maritime
law
against
the
union,
despite
all
of
the
congressional
acts
dealing
with
unions.
and
that
didn't
preempt.
and
certainly
the
jones
act
and
dohsa
don't
preempt
as
far
as
the
general
maritime
claims
are
concerned.
as
far
as
the
estate's
claim,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
those
damages
place
that
estate
back
to
where
it
would
have
been.
and
what
evich
court
was
saying
was
going
back
to
the
old
common
law
principle
that
the
wrongdoer
does
not
benefit
from
his
wrong.
and
for
that
reason
those
damages
should
be
allowed.
it
may
be
a
peculiar
item
of
damages,
but
in...
under
the
admiralty
law
there
are
other
peculiar
items.
there
is
limitation
of
liability.
there
is
general
average.
there
are
rules
in
the
admiralty
courts
that
certainly
are
unusual,
and
there
should
be
no
reason
why
this
element
of
damages
should
not
be
allowed
under
a
survival
action,
especially
given
the
interpretation
that
it
is
better
to
give
the
remedy
than
to
deny
it,
and
the
humane
and
generous
character
of
the
admiralty
law
that
has
long
been
recognized
by
this
court.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
your
honor.
