justice
scalia
and
what
is
the
statutory
text
you
are
appealing
to
now?
justice
scalia
where
is
it
in
your
brief
that
you
say
parents
are
not--
justice
scalia
--well,
why
don't
you
give
me
a
page
so
i
can
look
at
the
words?
justice
scalia
but
where
you
said...
you're
relying
on
the
act,
on
the
language
"for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
the
decedent's
wife,
husband,
parent,
child,
or
dependent
relative?
"
what
language
are
you
relying
on--
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
principle
you
are
appealing
to,
that
somebody
has
to
be
able
to
collect
money
when
somebody
wrongfully
dies,
no
matter
what?
i
mean,
if
he
has
no
children,
no
parents,
we've
got
to
find
somebody
to
give
money
to?
justice
scalia
we
were
either
saying
that
or
we
were
mistaken.
justice
scalia
well,
we
weren't
holding
that
it
ended
the
anomalies,
if
it
in
fact
didn't.
i
mean,
that
was
our
interpretation,
i
suppose,
of
what
the
effect
of
the
earlier
case
was.
but
that
might
have
been...
might
have
been
an
error.
i
mean,
we
didn't
report
to
be
holding
anything
new
in
that
case.
justice
scalia
to
me
there
are
still
some
anomalies
around.
i
think
today's
argument...
to
convince
me
of
it.
justice
scalia
maybe
they
are
wards
of
the
captain.
