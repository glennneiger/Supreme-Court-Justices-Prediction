justice
o'connor
okay.
well,
i
suppose
we
have
to
decide
whether
there
is
such
a
cause
of
action.
i
think
you
are
kind
of
jumping
over
a
critical
step.
justice
o'connor
well,
why
should
this
court
create
such
a
cause
of
action
if
congress
hasn't
done
so?
well,
what...
what
are
you
talking
about?
wrongful
death
action?
justice
o'connor
and
the
jones
act
does
not
allow
loss
of
society
damages
for
death
resulting
from
negligence,
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
it
does
not.
justice
o'connor
and
if
we
were
to
confine
that
gaudet
case
to
its
facts,
i
guess
we
wouldn't
find
any
basis
for
liability
here.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
hardin,
you
can
make
a
sympathetic
argument
on
that
point,
but
unless
we're
satisfied
that
loss
of
society
damages
can
be
awarded
at
all
we
don't
get
there.
justice
o'connor
and
i
think
that
you
have
a
much
harder
case
on
that
question.
justice
o'connor
has
this
court
recognized
such
a
cause
of
action
in
the
circumstances
here?
justice
o'connor
no.
so
you
have
to
persuade
us
that
we
should.
justice
o'connor
but
how
about
in
moragne?
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
about
the
jones
act
sort
of
thing,
and
that
didn't
prevent
the
court
from
recognizing
a
cause
of
action
there.
justice
o'connor
sure,
but
the
same
type
of
argument
could
have
been
made
there,
and
the
court
recognized
a
cause
of
action.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
all
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
a
survival
action,
haven't
they?
can
you
think
of
any
that
haven't?
justice
o'connor
but
haven't
all
the
lower
courts
for
20
years
read
moragne
as
indicating
there
is
a
general
maritime
wrongful
death
act
for
seamen?
justice
o'connor
oh,
i
think
pretty...
you'd
be
very
hard
pressed
to
find
any
that
haven't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
today,
we
address
some
questions
concerning
recovery
under
general
maritime
law
following
the
wrongful
death
of
a
seaman.
we
began
by
reaffirming
the
rule
announced
in
moragne
versus
state
marine
lines
that
there
is
a
general
maritime
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death.
in
defining
the
scope
of
recovery,
we
are
guided
by
the
principle
that
a
federal
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
admiralty
powers
is
not
free
to
expand
remedies
beyond
the
well-considered
limitations
imposed
by
congress
through
statute.
we
hold
that
a
beneficiary
may
not
recover
loss
of
society
damages
in
an
action
for
the
wrongful
death
of
a
seaman.
general
maritime
law
is
thus,
rendered
uniform
within
the
system
of
recovery
for
wrongful
death
that
congress
created
in
the
jones
act
and
in
the
death
of
the
high
seas
act.
we
also
hold
that
a
seaman's
estate
may
not
recover
in
a
general
maritime
survival
action
for
future
earnings
loss
because
of
the
seaman's
death.
this
rule
is
consistent
with
the
jones
act
in
which
congress
precluded
recovery
for
lost
future
earnings
in
survival.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
souter
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
