what
about
brothers
and
sisters?
justice
stevens
mr.
hardin,
can
i
just
stop
you
right...
have
we
held
that,
that
there
are
no
state
remedies
in
territorial
waters?
justice
stevens
is
it
uniformly
held
in
the
lower
courts
that
there
is
no
state
cause...
state
wrongful
death
action
in
the
territorial
waters?
justice
stevens
are
they
all
fifth
circuit
cases?
justice
stevens
i
just
wonder
if
that
is
critical
to
your
argument.
i
am
just
not
sure
it
is.
justice
stevens
before
you
leave
moragne,
when
you
say
it
painted
with
a
broad
brush,
i
take
it
you
are
saying
that
nothing
in
the
opinion
made
it
seem
to
turn
on
the
fact
the
man
was
a
longshoreman.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
you
are
going
farther
than
the
fifth
circuit.
i
mean,
they
assume,
as
justice
white
says,
there
is
a
survival
action
to
recover
that
kind
of
damage.
you
say,
well,
there
isn't
even
that,
if
i
read
you--
justice
stevens
again
on
this
point,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
haven't
lost
track
of
the
case,
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
assumed
that
the
cause
of
action
was
available
to
seamen?
justice
stevens
assumed
that
both
causes
of
action
were
available--
justice
stevens
--but
did
not
allow
the
recovery
in
both
of
them.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask...
ask
you
your
own
view?
do
you
think
that
the
moragne
case
preempted
any
state
law
causes
of
action
death...
for
death,
death
actions
in
territorial
waters?
justice
stevens
does
the
florida
case
that
you
mentioned...
i
don't
know,
it's
probably
not
cited
in
the
briefs.
but
the
florida
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
federal
cause
of
action
prevented
the
state
of
florida
as
a
matter
of
preemption
from
having
it
state
law--
justice
stevens
--right.
justice
stevens
the
answer
was
no,
but
that
was
a
matter
of
state
law.
but
my
question...
it
seems
to
be
everybody
understands
this
except
me.
but...
but
i'm
trying
to--
justice
stevens
--well,
but
it's
a
simple
proposition.
the
question
i
am
uncertain
about,
and
your
opponent
seemed
to
be
certain,
is
that
did
moragne
have
the
effect,
because
it
held
a
maritime
cause
of
action
in
territorial
waters
for
the...
death
in
territorial
waters
existed,
did
that
preempt
any
state
attempt
to
create
a
state
cause
of
action
for
death
in
territorial
waters?
justice
stevens
you
think
it
did,
but
it
really
hasn't
been...
has
it
been
decided,
do
you
know?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
but
you
know,
it's
entirely
consistent
with
that...
of
course,
they
should...
they
are
intended
to
take
care
of
seamen
wherever
they
are,
but
they
do
not
necessarily
foreclose
other
remedies
that
may
be
provided
to
seamen
by
either
other
statutes,
maritime
law,
state
law,
whatever
it
is.
i
mean,
the
fact
that
it
was
a
general
protection
for
seamen
is
not
quite
the
same
as
saying
it's
the
only
protection
seamen
may
get,
which
is
what
you're
arguing,
as
i
understand
you.
