chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-1158,
mercedel
w.
miles
v.
apex
marine
corporation.
mr.
hardin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
a
lot
of
different
overlaps,
mr.
hardin,
aren't
you?
the
jones
act,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
maritime
law.
you're
not
suggesting
that
in
this
case
the
court
can
straighten
out
all
the
edges?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
in
higginbotham.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
talking
now
about
a
wrongful
death
claim,
not
a
survivor
claim.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you
are
not
talking...
you're
not
saying
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
covers
your
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
just
saying
by
analogy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
much
of
a
family
bond
is
there
between
an
emancipated
seaman,
23
or
24
years
old,
and
his
adult
parents?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
much
though?
it's
not
like
having
children
at
home.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you...
you
might
say
that
in
a
particular
case
one's
great
aunt
was
very
dear
to
him,
and
there
was
a
loss
of
society
there.
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
create
a
cause
of
action
for
the
loss
of
society
of
your
great
aunt.
you
draw
the
line
based
largely
on,
as
a
group
is
there...
does
there
tend
to
be
a
significant
loss
of
society
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
yet
you
urge
us
to
incorporate
from
the
jones
act
by
analogy.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but...
the
facts
of
gaudet
were
longshoreman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
was
a
5
to
4
decision.
the
court
is
not
likely
to
extend
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
he
shouldn't
have
to
compensate
any
more
than
there
have
been
actual
damages
incurred
by
that
wrong,
either.
and
if
a
person
has
no
dependents,
the
funeral
expenses
are
the
actual
damages.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
there
is
such
a
thing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
are
urging
loss
of
society
as
a
reason
why
we
can
give
compensation
to
a
whole
bunch
of
people
that
aren't
getting
it
now,
i
mean,
you
know,
that
may
appeal
to
some
and
not
appeal
to
others.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hardin.
mr.
gelpi,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
he
sued
under
the
jones
act.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
verdict
for?
chief
justice
rehnquist
during
his
lifetime?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
we
held
that
there
was...
there
was
no
survival
action
under
general
maritime
law
in
this
case,
would
we
do
anything
other
than
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gelpi.
mr.
hardin,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now,
mr.
hardin,
that
statement
appears
in
some
cases,
that
seamen
are
wards
of
the
court,
but
that
dates
from
centuries
ago,
when
seamen
really
were
in
a
tough
position.
they
have
unions
now,
they
make
good
money.
don't
you
think
that
is
a
little
bit
language
of
the
past?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
hardship.
there
are
statutes
that
limit
what
the...
limit
what
the
captain
can
do
to
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hardin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1158,
miles
versus
apex
marine
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
