justice
white
well,
there
is
a
wrongful
death
action,
i
suppose,
isn't
there?
we
have
recognized
a
wrongful
death
action--
justice
white
--under
the
general
maritime
law.
justice
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
well,
we
won't
give
you
nonpecuniary
loss
because
we
think
that
we
ought
to
hold
the
same
as
the
jones
act.
justice
white
was
that
we
ought
to
be
uniform.
they
said
we
ought
to
have
a
uniform...
if
they...
if
you...
didn't
they
take
some
guidance
from
the
jones
act?
justice
white
and
dohsa.
justice
white
and
why
would,
why
would
there
be,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
a
recovery
for
loss
of
society
if
the
parents
were
dependent?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
the
longshoreman
couldn't
have
been
under
the...
couldn't
have
recovered
under
the
jones
act.
justice
white
even
if
he
was
doing
seamen's
work.
justice
white
by
the
circuit
justice
of
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
white
the
dissent
was
by
the
circuit
justice
for
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
wouldn't
you
have
been
surprised,
be
surprised
though
that
the
majority
in
gaudet,
five,
or
whatever
it
was,
would
have
come
out
differently
if
a
seaman
had
been
injured?
justice
white
you
mean
because
of
the
jones
act?
justice
white
but
except
for
the
jones
act,
i
would
suppose
that
the
majority
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
if
it
had
been
for
a
seaman,
because
the
jones
act
was
cited
right
in
their
face.
justice
white
i
know,
i
know.
but
they
have
cited
by
analogy.
why
should
the
jones
act...
why
should
you
come
out
differently
than
the
jones
act
does.
justice
white
that
was
the
argument
of
the
dissent.
justice
white
he
doesn't
need
it.
justice
white
doesn't
need
it.
justice
white
are
you
arguing
that
there
should
be
no
survival
action
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
white
well,
the
fifth
circuit
recognizes
such
though,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
what...
what's
involved
in
this
case?
a
seaman?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
in
a
survival
action
you
can't
recover
wages.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
why
did
they
get
to
that
if
there
wasn't
a
survival
action
at
all?
justice
white
exactly.
but
you
don't
need
to
reach
that
issue
if
there
is
no
survival
action
at
all.
justice
white
well,
isn't
there
a
true
seaman
here?
justice
white
well,
but
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
hold
that
there
is
no
survival
action
at
all.
justice
white
--well,
that's
right,
that's
right.
but
now
there's
a
claim...
there's
a
claim
that
there
is
a
survival
action
under
the--
--maritime
law.
justice
white
--general
maritime
law.
counsel,
here
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
just
on
this
point.
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear.
my
understanding
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
recognize
under
general
maritime
law
a
survival
cause
of
action,
not
for
the
damages
that
we're
discussing
here.
justice
white
all
right.
but
you
are
arguing
there
isn't
one.
justice
white
i
know,
but
you're
saying
under
the
general
maritime
law
there
is
none.
justice
white
all
right.
in
this
case
there
is
no...
under
the
maritime
law
he
has
no
cause
of
action
on
a
survival
basis.
justice
white
then
you
are
really
asking
for
a
greater
relief
than
the
fifth
circuit
gave
you,
and
i'd
guess
you
didn't
cross-petition,
did
you?
