mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
xxx
said
there
was
no
recovery
except
for
funeral
expenses.
to
answer
the
query
of
justice
scalia,
that
was
the
proper
result
in
that
case.
just
because
there's
an
accident
or
death
doesn't
automatically
mean
there
is
liability.
and
just
because
there
is
liability
doesn't
automatically
mean
there
is
a
person
entitled
to
recover
damages.
i
was
going
to
be
a
bit
different
in
my
approach
to
my
argument,
but
there
are
some
things
i
think
i
need
to
say
first.
moragne
involved
a
longshoreman.
at
that
time
a
longshoreman
had
cause
of
action
under
state
law
if
it
provided
him
a
remedy
for
unseaworthiness.
and
moragne
gave
the
longshoreman...
admittedly
moragne
painted
with
a
broad
brush,
but
it
was
a
longshoreman's
case,
and
it
gave
the
longshoreman
the
right
to
sue
for
unseaworthiness
in
the
event
of
a
death
case.
gaudet,
some
4
years--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--i
think
there
is
some
language
in
moragne
that
has
been
seized
upon...
seized
upon
is
too
strong
a
word,
mr.
justice
brennan...
stevens,
is
too
strong
a
word
which
has
been
interpreted
by
the
lower
courts
to
say
that
moragne
applied
to
seamen.
there
is
no
case,
to
my
knowledge,
which
was
given
a
general
maritime
law
wrongful
death
benefit,
no
supreme
court
case--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--to
a
seaman.
lindgren
in
1930
said
no,
that
is
not
what
the
jones
act
meant.
gillespie,
34
years
later,
said
no,
that
is
not
what
the
jones
act
meant.
and
i
suggest
that
the
reasoning
in
your
honors'
opinion
in
higginbotham
and
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
tallentire
said
where
congress
has
set
out
a
scheme
and
has
entered
the
field
and
has
preempted
the
field...
you
all
were
both
talking
about
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
those
cases.
where
congress
has
entered
the
field
and
has
preempted
it,
it
has
struck
the
balance
for
us.
it
did
not
create
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
a
remedy
which
required
and
gave
only
pecuniary
loss
to
encourage
courts
to
expand
or
supplement
that
remedy.
gaudet
in
1974
was
a
5
to
4
decision
with
a
vigorous
dissent.
it
applied
to
a
longshoreman.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
sir?
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
is
that
right?
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
but
even
if
you
apply
gaudet
to
seamen,
i
don't
think
we
can
extend
it
that
far.
clearly,--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--i
think
congress
enters
the
field
for
the
seaman,
and
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
alvez,
an
opinion
cited
by...
by--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--yes,
sir.
in
answer
to--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--yes,
sir.
the
query
posed
by
mr.
chief
justice,
can
we
straighten
all
the
edges,
this
is
a
very
confused
field.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
the
jones
act
didn't
find
gaudet--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--because
the
jones--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--yes,
sir.
the
jones
act
struck
the
balance,
to
use
mr.
justice
stevens'
words,
struck
the
balance.
and
he
was
talking
about
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
but
it's
a
symbol
of
federal
statute
created
in...
passed
in
1920,
and
supplemented
by
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
of
1908,
as
amended
in
1910,
to
provide
remedies
for
seamen.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
moragne
did
not
deal
with
the
jones
act.
it
dealt
with...
it
was
creating
a
wrongful
death
remedy
for
a
longshoreman.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
there
would
have
been...
i
don't
know
that
that
argument
was
in
fact
made.
i
don't
read
the
opinion
as
overcoming
that
argument.
as
i
said
before,
i
view
the
opinion
as
painted
with
a
very
broad
brush,
which
i
think
has
been
narrowed
by
the
wisdom
of
this
court
in
higginbotham
and
tallentire.
alvez
says
the
jones
act
doesn't
regulate
longshoremen
that
strictly.
of
course
not.
the
jones
act
doesn't
regulate
longshoremen
at
all.
it
applies
to
seamen.
now,
it
was
mention
of
the
third
anomaly,
and
justice
scalia
commented
on
that
a
bit.
the
third
anomaly
doesn't
exist
if
we
throw
out
moragne,
because
from
1972
on
the
longshoremen,
by
the
1972
amendments
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act,
has
no
injury
or
death
remedy
for
unseaworthiness.
but
what
this
court
has
the
opportunity
to
do--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--sir?
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
well,
whether
he
does
or
doesn't,
he's
got
a
compensation
act.
with
the
damages
he
has
to
prove
negligence.
so
the
anomaly
does
not
exist
if
we...
if
we
say
that
general
maritime
or
wrongful
death
statute
doesn't
apply
in
the
seaman's
case,
the
true
seaman's
case.
what
this
court
can
straighten
the
edges
and
make
uniform
the
law
as
it
applies
to
seamen,
a
particular
class
for
which
an
act,
the
jones
act
of
1920,
was
passed.
the
jones
act
was
passed
to
overcome
partially
the
harrisburg
and
partially
the
osceola,
which
said
the
seaman
has
no
cause
of
action
for
the
negligence
of
a
fellow
servant,
and
no
cause
of
action
for
the
negligence
of
his
employer.
the
jones
act
said
we
are
going
to
change
that.
they
did
not
see
fit
to
change
the
harrisburg
rule
to
the
extent
that
it
allowed
a
cause
of
action
for
death
based
on
unseaworthiness.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
i
don't
think
they
have
recognized
it,
except
for
evich,
in
the
case
of
the
jones
act
seaman.
and
evich,
as
i
discuss
in
the
brief,
we
suggest
is
just
a
wrong
decision.
evich
and
the
decision
of
judge
beaks
in
muirhead
upon
which
evich...
evich
ii,
i'm
talking
about,
treated
as
a
dohsa,
death
on
the
high
seas
case.
evich
was
a
seaman
as
i
read
the
cases,
including
the
original
berg
v.
chevron
case.
so
there
was
no
reason
to
supplement
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
which
provides
no
survival
action.
since
evich
was
a
seaman,
the
jones
act,
through
section
59
of
the
fela,
provides
a
survival
action.
and
that
survival
action,
if
i
may
discuss
that
for
a
moment
now,
has
been
interpreted
by
craft
to
be
that
which
the
decedent
would
have
had
available
to
him
but
for
his
death.
and
the
craft
language
of
1915
specifically
addresses
the
point
raised
by
petitioner,
taking
no
notice
of
what
he
might
have
become
or
what
he
might
have
earned
during
his
lifetime.
and
that
was
a
fela
case
which
applies
to
the
jones
act.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
no
general
maritime
law
survival
action
available
to
the
beneficiaries
of
the
seaman.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
not...
not
in
a
seaman's
case,
i
don't
think.
they
disagree--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--this
case,
the
seaman--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--future
lost
wages.
but...
but--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--because
they
said
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
citing
evich
v.
morris,
they
didn't
agree
with
evich
v.
morris.
and
that
is
where
we
have
a
split
in
the
circuits.
the
ninth
circuit
said,
in
that
one
decision,
said
that
a
general
maritime
law
survival
action
exists
which
encompasses
the
future
lost
wages.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
i
don't
think
there
is
in
the
case
of
a
true
seaman,
your
honor.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
it
didn't
give
him
one.
they
gave
him
the
survival
action
for...
they
gave
the
mother,
mrs.
miles,
a
survival
action
for
conscious
pain
and
suffering
under
the
jones
act.
the
jones
act
has
a
survival
section
brought
in
through
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
section
59.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
yes,
sir.
and
he
recovered
a
verdict,
and
that
verdict
was
satisfied.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
conscious
pain
and
suffering,
and
loss
of
support.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
there
is
certainly,
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
is
certainly
a
survival
action
as
provided
by
the
jones
act,
and
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
approved,
and
that
is
what
we
paid.
that
part
of
the
case
is
gone.
the
fifth
circuit
said
the
survival
action
is
under
the
jones
act
and
doesn't
contemplate
loss
of
wages.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
general
maritime
law.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
that's
correct.
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
there
is
one
as
for
a
seaman,
your
honor.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
not
to
a
seaman,
because
his
rights
are
set
forth
in
the
jones
act.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
i
think
that
is
a
correct
reading.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
on
another
issue
on
this.
we
cross-petitioned
on
unseaworthiness
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
i
think
you
would
hold
what
higginbotham
suggested
should
be
held,
and
what
i
think
tallentire
did.
yes,
you
would
affirm
it.
there...
i
think
there
are
decisions
which,
and
i...
but
i
don't
think
judge
rubin's
decision
was
one,
i
think
there
are
decisions
where,
and
i
can't
quote
one
to
you,
your
honor,
where
they
may
have
said
a
jones
act
seaman...
evich
v.
morris
is
a
specific
one
where
the
ninth
circuit
said
a
jones
act
seaman
has,
in
addition
to
whatever
he
has
under
the
jones
act,
a
general
maritime
law
survival
action.
now,
the
future
damages
to...
that
are
sought
in
this
case
are
not
survival
damages,
because
they
don't
accrue
to
the
decedent
while
he
lived.
and
as
the
language
of
gaudet,
which
talked
about
survival
versus
wrongful
death...
in
fact
it
said
survival
damages
are
those
which
the
decedent
could
have
recovered
but
for
his
death.
these
are
damages
the
estate...
an
inanimate,
nondependent
estate,
i
might
add,
which
judge
rubin
found
important,
would
occur...
seek...
because
of
his
death.
so
it
is
not
the
but
for,
it
is
because
of.
the
damages
sought
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
are
not
given
by
any
of
the
federal
statutes
involved.
and
i
can't
emphasize
often
enough
how
this
court
has
recognized,
in
1978
and
again
in
1986,
that
where
congress
has
struck
the
balance
it
did
not
do
so
to
encourage
courses
of
supplement,
specified
items
of
recovery,
and
theories
of
recovery.
the
decision
in
evich
v.
morris
seems
to
me
to
be
based
on
the
rather
inartfully
expressed,
i
suggest,
language
that
giving...
give
the
estate
these
survival
damages...
these
damages
as
survival,
because
if
you
don't
you
award
a
tort
feasor
for
killing
his
victim
rather
than
injuring
him.
that
smacks
strongly
of
punitive
damages.
it
says
so
that
you
don't
reward
him,
let's
punish
him.
there
is
somebody
who
is
being
punished
in
this
case,
as
properly
should
have
been.
clifford
melrose
is
the
murderer,
and
he
is
in
jail.
the...
the
jury
found--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--i'm
glad
your
honor
mentioned
the
word
unseaworthiness,
because
unseaworthiness
in
this
specific
case
was
found
to
be
liability
without
fault.
and
i
think
it
really
strains
reason
to
say
where
somebody
is
liable
without
fault,
as
gaudet
did
and
as
evich
did,
that
you
give
him
more
damages
than
the
jones
act,
which
requires
fault.
congress
considered
the
rights
and
remedies
it
wanted
to
give
the
seaman.
it
passed
the
jones
act
to
overcome
some
of
the
problems
with
the
osceola
and
the
harrisburg.
that
was
in
1920.
in
1930
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
lindgren
considered
whether
the
decedent
beneficiaries
had
a
cause
of
action
under
the
unseaworthiness
claim,
and
the
court
said
no.
that
is
not
what
congress
did.
34
years
later
gillespie
considered
the
same
issue
and
said
congress
hasn't
amended
the
statute
since
then,
it
still
means
what
it
says.
to
this
date
congress
has
not
amended
the
statute,
despite
moragne.
congress
knows
how
to
amend
a
statute
when
they
want
to.
they...
in
1982
they
limited
the
remedies
available
to
jones
act
workers,
or
people
who
want
to
be
jones
act
workers
in
the
foreign
oil
fields,
foreign
nationals
in
foreign
territorial
waters.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
amended
in
about
1980
or
1983
to
extend
the
period
of
the
limitations
for
3
years
rather
than
2.
while
it
doesn't
relate
to
seamen's
rights,
congress
acted
in
1972
to
amend
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
act
to
take
away
from
archery
gaudet
and
edward
moragne
and
their
beneficiaries.
after
1972,
for
accidents
occurring
after
1972,
they
don't
have
anymore
unseaworthiness
remedies.
so
congress
knows
how
to
act,
and
has
acted.
the
language
of
gaudet,
if...
if
we
assume...
and
i
am
just
about
finished
unless
the
court
has
some
more
questions...
if
we
assume
that
gaudet
for
some
reason
should
extend
to
seamen,
and
i
submit
earnestly
it
should
not,
and
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
higginbotham,
and
while
slightly
different
in
tallentire
but
the
principles
are
the
same,
that
congress
has
entered
the
field
for
jones
act--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--yes,
sir,
it
did.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
yes,
it
did.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
it
did
for
a
longshoreman,
because
the
florida
supreme
court
gave
its
opinion
that
the
state
death
act
did
not
provide
a
remedy
based
on
unseaworthiness.
and
it
was,
i
suggest,
to
fill
that
vacuum
to
give
[inaudible]
ella
moragne
a
remedy
to
collect
for
the
death
of
her
husband,
who
didn't
have
a
state
law
remedy
and
had
no
unseaworthiness
remedy
under
the
harrisburg,
and
had
no
federal
statute
dealing
with
his
remedies
against
tort
feasors,
who
created
that
remedy.
and
i
think
they
painted
with
too
broad
a
brush
so
that
some
of
the
district
courts
and
appellate
courts
have
implied...
felt
that
it
applied
to
seamen.
but
i
think
that
the
language--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--no,
sir.
florida
was...
moragne...
mrs.
moragne
sued
under
the
florida
death
statute.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
and
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
don't
remember
which,
but
it
is
discussed
in
the
moragne
opinion,
certified
to
the
florida
state
supreme
court
the
question
of
whether
its
wrongful
death
statute
encompassed
an
unseaworthiness
remedy.
and
the
answer
was
no.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
a
lot
of
people
don't
understand
this
whole
field.
it's
very
confusing,
your
honor.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
i
would
think
it
did
for
longshoremen,
because
that's
the
class
of
claim
that
it
dealt
with.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
i
am
not
aware
of
anything.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
and
there
is
no
court
saying
that
moragne
applies
to
a
seaman,
no
supreme
court
saying
that.
at
the
times
the
issue
of
a
jones
act
seaman's
rights
to
recover
for
unseaworthiness
in
a
death
case
have
been
before
this
court
in
lindgren
and
gillespie,
and
they
said
no.
general
maritime
law
survival
statute
was
in
cortes,
and
they
said
no,
the
jones
act
covers
it.
and
i
think
the
opinions
in
higginbotham
and
tallentire
soundly
state
the
principle
why
those
old
decisions,
someone
said
hoary
but...
but
valid,
are
valid
decisions.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
i
wouldn't
agree
all,
but
a
lot
of
them
have.
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
the
ones
in
the
fifth
circuit
have.
i've
had
that
issue
before.
but
i
think
your
honor's
reasoning
in
tallentire
v....
offshore
logistics
v.
tallentire,
and
justice
stevens'
reasoning
in
higginbotham,
while
they
dealt
with
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
would
apply
equally
if
not
more
so
with
respect
to
the
jones
act,
which
is
to
take
care
of
seamen
wherever
they
are.
it
was
remedial
legislation
passed
to
take
care
of
seamen,
and
to
protect
them
and
their
dependents.
dependency
is
required
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act;
pecuniary
loss
is
required.
i
suggest
that--
mr.
gerard
t.
gelpi
--yes,
sir,
it
is.
and
i
would
adopt
your
reasoning
in
higginbotham,
your
honor,
which
applied
to
say
that
there
is
no
general
maritime
law
remedy
available
to
someone
who
is
subject
to
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
why
is
that
given
any
more
deference
than
the
jones
act,
which
is
for
a
specific
class
of
beneficiaries?
now,
the...
i'm
almost
finished,
obviously,
unless
the
court
has
anymore
questions.
a
couple
more
points
i
would
like
to
make.
if
we
have
a
loss-of-society
remedy
available,
and
i
strongly
suggest
that
the
jones
act
precludes
that,
moragne
said
we
do
not
decide
who
the
beneficiary
is
and
we
do
not
decide
the
remedies.
that
is
grist
for
the
mills
of
the
lower
courts.
but
the
practical
difficulties
of
deciding
what
the
class
of
beneficiaries
is
something
that
will
have
to
be
done.
gaudet,
whether
i
like
the
decision
or
not,
whether
it
applies
to
seamen
or
not,
used
the
words
"dependent",
"dependent
upon"
so
many
times
that
i
can't
believe
justice
brennan
meant
anything
but
dependency
as
we
understand
it.
if
you
have
no
more
questions,
i
will
sit
down.
thank
you.
