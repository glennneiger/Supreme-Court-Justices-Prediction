this
is
in
a
wrongful
death
action?
justice
kennedy
is
it
clearly
established
that
nondependent
parents
may
recover
for
loss
of
society
under
death
on
the
high
seas?
no.
justice
kennedy
all
right.
just
like
the
jones
act.
and
the
same
with
the
jones
act,
correct?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
justice
kennedy
well,
you're
going
to
tell
us
next,
aren't
you,
that
lost
wages
should
be
included?
justice
kennedy
did
you
make
this
point
in
your
brief,
that
there's
no
wrongful
death
action
at
all
for
the
seaman?
justice
kennedy
and
then,
and
justice
o'connor
was
correct
earlier
when
she
said
all
of
the
circuits
have
agreed,
that
have
addressed
this
point,
that
there
is
a
such
a
survival
cause
of
action
for
other
kinds
of
damages,
not
these
damages.
justice
kennedy
but
we're
talking
about
unseaworthiness
generally,
and
it's
recognized
in
the
law
of
torts
that
compensation
is
in
part
to...
in
large
part
to
ensure
proper
conduct
on
the
part
of
employers.
that's
hardly
a
novel
principle.
