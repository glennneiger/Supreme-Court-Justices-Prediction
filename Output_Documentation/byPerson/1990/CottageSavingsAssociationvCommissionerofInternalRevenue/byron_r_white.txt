what
accounting
effect
was
intended
by
r-49?
justice
white
what
do
you
mean
put
the
loss?
justice
white
book
the
loss.
all
right.
it
need
not
book
the
loss--
justice
white
--under
49.
justice
white
but
they
could
claim
a
tax...
even
though
you
didn't
book
the
loss,
you
would
claim
a
tax
loss?
justice
white
i
take
it
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
you
on
1001?
justice
white
and
they
turned
you
down
on
165?
justice
white
so
for
you
to
win
you
have
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
165?
justice
white
well,
i
would
suppose
we
wouldn't
decide
that.
we
would
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
(a)
165
and
wrong
on
1001
and
remand
to
see
if
in
this
particular
transaction
there
was
a
material
difference.
because
i
don't
know
that
you
get
the
same
answer
on
every
single
trade
of
mortgages,
would
you?
justice
white
so
you
would...
if...
if
the...
if
we
would
say
the
regulation
is
valid,
you
would
then
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
rationale?
justice
white
is
it
because
all
mortgages
are
unique?
justice
white
from
a
computer
point
of
view.
justice
white
mr.
roberts,
what
should...
don't
you
have
to
do
something
about
the
court
of
appeals'
holding?
justice
white
say
that
again?
justice
white
oh,
yes.
