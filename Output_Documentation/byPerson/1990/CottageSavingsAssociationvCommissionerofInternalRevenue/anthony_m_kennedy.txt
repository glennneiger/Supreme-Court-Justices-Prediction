justice
kennedy
so
the
accounting
effect
was
really
nil
if
you
elected
not
to
book
the
loss?
justice
kennedy
is
that
consistent
with
eisner
v.
macomber?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
thought
that
there
was
an
event.
there
was
an
event
of
a
stock
dividend,
was
there
not?
if
i
recall.
justice
kennedy
well,
it
would
be
if
the
stock
dividend
were
disproportional.
justice
kennedy
and
the
only
reason
that
it,
it
was
held
to
be
nontaxable
was
the
economic
position
of
the
taxpayer
hadn't
changed.
justice
kennedy
but
that
simply
is
inconsistent
with
the
whole
design
of
these
transactions.
they
matched
up
the
mortgages
on
the
computer
banks
and
they
came
out
within
a
few
cents
of
each
other,
and
they
switched.
and
there
was
absolutely
no
showing
that...
unless
i'm
wrong,
correct
me...
that
they
investigated
to
see
if
they
were
going
to
get
high
rent,
or
high
income
homes
or
low-income
homes.
nobody
seemed
to
care.
they
were
just
switching
these
mortgages
around.
correct
me
if
i'm
mistaken.
justice
kennedy
but
you
think
the
arguments
are
essentially
the
same?
loss
sustained
and
gain
realized
is
the
same
concept?
justice
kennedy
does
the
accounting
reference
you
made
appear
in
any
of
your
briefs?
justice
kennedy
thank
you.
