justice
souter
did
the
computer
matching
and
analysis
seek
to
make
an
analysis
of
relative
risk,
so
that
the
computer
was
attempting
in
effect
to
substitute
one
pool
with
a
given
level
of
risk
with
another
at
exactly
the
same
level
of
risk?
justice
souter
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
what
you
mean
by
that.
justice
souter
let's
forget
r-49.
if
i'm
just
going
out
on
the
market
to
buy
a
participation
in
a
pool
of
mortgages,
and
i
am
looking
at
the
two
pools
in
question
here,
does
the
computer
purport
to
tell
me
that
i
am
buying
a
participation
with
the
same
level
of
investment
risk,
no
matter
which
of
the
two
i
buy
into?
justice
souter
sure,
but
i
want
to
know
what
the
risk
is
that
i'm
not
going
to
get
the
income.
i
want
to
know
what
the
risk
is
that
there's
going
to
be
a
default.
am
i
buying...
do
i
have
a
choice
based,
assuming
the
computer
is
properly
programmed,
do
i
have
a
choice
of
buying
into
two,
two
pools
of
equal
risk,
or
am
i
simply
buying
into
two
pools
of
mortgages
with
roughly
equal
collaterals
and
net
values
of
collateral,
market
values
of
collateral?
justice
souter
and
that's
what
i
want
you
to
tell
me.
justice
souter
i
mean,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
whether
there
is
a
material
difference
depends
in
part
of
what
kinds
of
differences
would
be
relevant
to
a
mortgage
lender.
and
one
of
the
things
that
a
mortgage
lender
would
be
concerned
with
is
the
degree
of
risk.
and
if
what
we
have
got
are
two
pools
which
on
the
matter
of
risk
are
virtually
homogeneous,
that
may
suggest
one
answer
in
this
case.
but
if
we
have
got
two
pools
in
which
the
risks,
relative
risks,
have
not
been
assessed,
then
we
might
come
up
with
another
answer.
justice
souter
well,
is...
your
answer
to
my
question
then
is
no,
the
computer
did
not
purport
to
give
you
two
pools
of
identical
risk?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
why
isn't
that
true
in
the
stock
example?
justice
souter
the
market
values
the
stock
by
taking
the
risk
into
consideration,
and
the
market
says
in
effect
holding
this
stock
gives
you
in
effect
the
same
economic
risk
as
holding
the
$10,000.
justice
souter
no,
but
that's
true,
but
i
think
to
the...
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
to
the
extent
that
you
were
replying
to
justice
scalia
that
you
had
sort
of
two
identical
risk
situations,
that
that
was
decisive
on
material
difference.
and
if
that's
going
to
be,
then
i
think
you've
got
to
carry
the
argument
beyond
the
exchange
of
mortgages
into
the
stock
example.
justice
souter
but
on
that
reasoning,
if
the
computer
had
matched
up
two
baskets
of
common
stock,
you
would
then
reach
the
same
result
in
this
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
souter
what
about
baskets
of
stock
in
the
same
industry?
all
common
stock,
all
in
oils
or
all
in
chemicals,
and
so
on?
justice
souter
because
the
companies
are
different.
justice
souter
what
about
exchanges
of
shares
identically
valued
in
two
separate
bond
funds?
the
person
who
buys
doesn't
know
what
bonds
his
fund
is
holding.
justice
souter
well,
i
think
though,
we're...
again
we're
right
back
to
the
fact
that
there
are
differences
in
the
homeowners
who
are
going
to
pay
or
not
pay
the
loans,
there
are
differences
in
the
banks
who
are
not...
are
or
are
not
going
to
collect
promptly.
i
don't
see
where
the
distinction
lies.
justice
souter
yeah,
but
in
my
example
the
differences
in
the
bonds
in
the
two
funds
didn't
make
any
difference
to
the
fair
market
value
of
the
share
of
stock
either.
and
yet
no
one
would
argue
that
the
bonds
were
all
identical
and
that
they
all
carried...
that
they
all
were
in
fact
going
to
perform
necessarily
in
the
same
way
over
time.
