justice
o'connor
well,
mr.--
justice
o'connor
--mr.
manes,
don't
we
really
have
to
look
at
the
code
provisions
to
see
if
there's
a
tax
loss
or
not?
do
you
plan
to
talk
about
that?
justice
o'connor
well--
--why
don't
you
tell
us
about
it.
the
treasury
has
a
regulation
that
says
there
has
to
be
a
material
difference
if
there
is
an
exchange.
now,
is
this
an
exchange
or
a
sale,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
so
we
take
the
case
assuming
it's
an
exchange?
justice
o'connor
okay.
justice
o'connor
all
right.
and
there
may
have
to
be
a
material
difference,
however,
if
we
apply
the
treasury
regulation?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
we
normally
defer
to
irs
regulations
that
interpret
the
statute,
and
they
say
there
has
to
be
a
material
difference.
they
talk
about,
for
example,
the
situation
of
exchanging
bushels
of
wheat
if
the
price
of
wheat
drops,
and
they
argue
that
that
would
be
a
perversion
of
the
statute
to
say
that
we
will
recognize
a
loss
in
that
situation.
justice
o'connor
but
there's
language
in
some
of
this
court's
opinions
that
there
has
to
be...
to
the
effect
that
there
has
to
be
a
material
difference,
and
perhaps
the
irs
was
trying
to
codify
that
language,
in
effect,
with
its
regulation.
justice
o'connor
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
that.
but
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
today
in
the
exchange
of
bushels
of
wheat
example
that
we
should
recognize
a
tax
gain
or
loss?
justice
o'connor
yes
or
no?
under
today's
law
do
you
take
the
view
that
an
exchange
of
bushels
of
wheat
should
result
in
a
taxable
gain
or
loss?
justice
o'connor
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
the
deference
we
owe
to
the
regulation
means
that
we
will
apply
it?
do
you
have
a
fallback
position?
justice
o'connor
mr.
roberts,
if
the
facts
had
been
just
the
reverse
and
the
values
of
the
properties
had
gone
up
and
there
was
an
exchange,
what
position
would
irs
take?
justice
o'connor
but
you
may
have
other
situations
where
there
are
exchanges
in
the
future
for...
where
there
might
be
a
gain,
and
the
irs
is
prepared
to
apply
exactly
the
same
test
to
that
one?
justice
o'connor
and
what
do
you
look
at?
just
the
fact
that
the
economic
value
at
the
time
of
the
exchange
is
the
same?
justice
o'connor
no.
justice
o'connor
what's
your
test,
then,
for
material
difference?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
regulation
when
it
was
adopted
was
intended
to
do
any
more
than
effectively
codify
this
court's
decisions?
justice
o'connor
i'm
just...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
you
say
the
limiting
principle
is
here
for
the
government's
test.
it
just
isn't
clear
to
me
yet.
justice
o'connor
the
differences
actually
relied
upon.
justice
o'connor
well,
they
have
put
forth
those
differences
here.
there
are
different
risks
of
repayment.
they've
put
forth
those
as
differences.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
they
are,
because
each
borrower
has
a
different
ability
to
repay
the
loan,
and
perhaps
the
security,
the
collateral,
is
different.
