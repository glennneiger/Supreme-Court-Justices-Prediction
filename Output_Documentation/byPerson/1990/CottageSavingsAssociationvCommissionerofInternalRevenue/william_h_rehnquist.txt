chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1965,
cottage
savings
association
v.
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
manes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
the
regulation
then
is
unauthorized
by
the
statutes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
one
were
to
imply
the
converse
from
the
regulation,
would
you
say
the
converse
implication
was
not
authorized
by
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
don't
say
that
it
seems
to
me
you
lose
your
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
manes.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
there
any
finding
in
the
tax
court
or
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
secondary
mortgage
market
had
this
characteristic
which
you
describe?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
a
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
by
the
tax
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
by
the...
that
came
up
through
the
federal
district
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
more
factual
inquiries
in
cases
involving
the
recognition
of
gain
if
the
court
accepts
your
theory,
i
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
they--
--but
your
economic
position
doesn't
change
lots
of
times
and
when
you
nonetheless
have
to
recognize
the
loss
or
gain.
if
you
sell
property
for
a
certain
amount
of
money,
your
economic
position
doesn't
change,
but
you
nonetheless
may
have
to
recognize
the
loss.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
you
say
your
economic
position
changes
dramatically
when
you
sell
stock...
50
shares
of
stock
for
$10,000.
the
actual
physical
property
which
you
possess,
the
share
of
stock
as
opposed
to
the
dollars,
changes,
but
i
don't
see
how
your
economic
position
changes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
holding
a
different
asset,
yup.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
for
some
centuries
since
the
invention
of
money,
i
thought
people
would
have
said
you
economic
position
was
the
same.
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
you
think
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
do
defend
the
court
of
appeals'
treatment
of
165
if
we
reach
that
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
manes,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manes.
the
case
is
submitted.
