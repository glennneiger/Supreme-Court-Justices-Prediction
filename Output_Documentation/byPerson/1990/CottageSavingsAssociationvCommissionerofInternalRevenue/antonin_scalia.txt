justice
scalia
of
course,
the
home
loan
bank
board
doesn't
give
tax
advice,
does
it?
did
the
home
loan
bank
board
assure
your
clients
that
they'd
get
a
tax
deduction?
justice
scalia
yes,
right.
justice
scalia
and
you
could
have...
you
could
have
gone
to
the
internal
revenue
service
or
to
the
treasury
and
asked
for
advice
on
the
matter,
i
suppose,
couldn't
you?
was
that
done?
justice
scalia
you
can't
really
say
the
government
misled
you
here.
the
home
loan
bank
board
gave
you
a
regulatory
boon
enabling
you
to
apply
for
a
tax
loss
without
losing
any
solvency
as
far
as
the
regulator
was
concerned,
but
they
didn't
give...
guarantee
anything
beyond
that.
justice
scalia
sure,
it
was.
but
it
was
not
an
agency
of
the
government
who
said
you
can
have
a
tax
benefit.
so
the
fact
that
it
was
an
agency
of
the
government
makes
no
difference.
it
said
you
can
do
this
without
running
afoul
of
regulatory
restrictions,
right?
justice
scalia
and
they
made
good
on
that
promise.
they
didn't
pursue
you
for
doing
this.
i
mean,
you
were
not
required
to
decrease
your
net
worth
for
regulatory
purposes,
right?
justice
scalia
so
they
gave
you
everything
they
promised.
justice
scalia
they
have
no
authority
to
pronounce
on
tax
consequences.
you
could
have
gotten
a
letter
from
treasury
if
you
wanted
to
be
sure
about
that.
you
were
rolling
the
dice,
right?
justice
scalia
that
you
were
free
to
roll
the
dice.
that's
all
they
told
you.
justice
scalia
well,
but
then
you're
saying
the
regulation
could
be
valid,
but
that
the
irs
is
interpreting
it
incorrectly.
justice
scalia
that
the
regulation
should
be
read
to
refer
to
these
supreme
court
cases
that
established
a
constitutional
distinction.
justice
scalia
this
is
a
subjective
test
or
is
it
an
objective
test?
justice
scalia
you
first
said
that
the...
whether
the
differences
were
of
a
nature
as
to
affect
the
decision,
and
now
you're
saying
here
they
in
fact
didn't
affect
the
decision.
which
is
going
to
be
crucial
for
your--
justice
scalia
--suppose...
suppose
two
taxpayers
who
have
stock
in
different
mutual
funds
have
a
study
done
by
an
expert,
and
he
says
these
two
funds,
their
performance
in
the
past
has
been
just
about
the
same,
in
the
future
they
are
likely
to
be
the
same,
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it's
tweedle-dum
and
tweedle-dee.
and
they
swap
their
stock
in
these
two
different
mutual
funds.
is
that
a...
is
that
an
event
that
would
trigger
a
gain
or
a
loss,
or
not?
justice
scalia
it
is?
why?
justice
scalia
well,
these
houses
are
owned
by
different
people,
whose
economic
success
and
ability
to
pay
their
mortgages
are
quite
different.
justice
scalia
if
you
take
a
mortgage
on
a
house
you
want
to
know
who
the
mortgagor
is,
too.
justice
scalia
but
that's
being
subjective.
you're
just
saying
not
that
nobody
could
see
a
difference,
but
that
this
particular
trader
didn't
care.
justice
scalia
no.
because
if
i
was
doing
the
swap
i
would
have
cared.
you
see,
i
wouldn't
have...
i
wouldn't
have
accepted
that.
i
want
to
know
who
these
mortgagors
are.
so
you're
really
not
applying
an
objective
test.
you're
just
saying
that
these
particular
traders
didn't
care
who
the
mortgagors
were.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
it's
not
any
trader.
it's
a
trader
who's
in
the
secondary
mortgage
market.
justice
scalia
does
it
have
to
be
a
trader
in
the
secondary
mortgage
market
living
in
new
york?
justice
scalia
you
know,
how
specific...
when
you
get
specific
enough
then
it's
the
same
thing
as
a
subjective
test.
justice
scalia
but
that
just
shows
that
these
traders
didn't
care.
justice
scalia
so,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
what
you
recite
in
your
brief
as
being
a
simple
example,
you
very
facilely
say
swapping
one
bushel
of
wheat
for
another
bushel
of
wheat
doesn't
make
any
difference,
that
that's
not
an
event
that
triggers
recognition,
that's
really
not
true.
you
really
have
to
know
who
the
traders
are,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
well,
there's
two
farmers
and
i
say,
you
know,
i
have
grown
this
new
type
of
wheat,
do
you
want
to
swap
it
for
some
of
your
old
wheat
and
you
try
some
of
mine
and
i'll
try
some
of
yours.
you
don't
consider
that
subjective?
you
say
that's
just
identifying
the
market?
that's...
that's
not
being
subjective?
justice
scalia
i
call
it
being
subjective.
justice
scalia
no
it
didn't,
no
it
didn't,
no
it
didn't.
all
you
have
established
is
that
they
didn't
care
very
much
about
what
differences
there
were
in
the
mortgage.
justice
scalia
but
they
were
really
different
loans,
those...
and
it
turned
out
that
the
loans
they
got
paid
off
a
good
deal
less
than
the
ones
they
swapped.
didn't
they
end
up
the
losers
on
the
thing,
100
and...
i
forget
what
the
number
was...
$160,000
or
so?
justice
scalia
but
that
shows
that
in
fact
what
they
got
was
quite
different
from
what
they
gave
up.
they
didn't
have
the
same
assets
afterwards.
justice
scalia
of
the
market,
you
say,
which--
justice
scalia
--let's
go
to
your
sinking...
your
sinking
fund
bonds
again
where,
where
they
are
selected
randomly
which
ones
will
be
paid
off
over
the
10-year
period.
and
let's
assume
i
call
up
a
friend
of
mine,
i
say
you
know,
i'm
feeling
lucky
this
week.
i
have
these
sinking
fund
bonds,
what
do
you
say
i
swap
mine
for
yours,
because
i'm
really
feeling
lucky.
now,
is
that...
does
that
trigger
recognition
of
loss
or
gain?
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
oh,
it
has
to
rise
to
the
level
of
being
a
market?
suppose
i
called
it
a
market,
a
market
in
sinking
fund
bonds,
you
know.
i'll
trade
you
the
numbers
i
have
for
the
numbers
you
have.
justice
scalia
but
this
is
a
material
difference
for
that
market.
suppose
there
are
10
people
that
do
this?
i
open
a
trading
post,
you
know,
for
people
who
want
to
gamble
with
these
bonds.
you
trade
the
numbers
i
have
for
the
numbers
you
have,
we'll
see
whose
gets
called
sooner
or
later.
that's
the
only,
the
only
thing
that
we're
trading
them
for.
and
you
say
that
does
not
create
a
market?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
why.
justice
scalia
well,
now
wait,
to
the
market
or
the
bank
board.
suppose
the
market
says
urban,
rural,
it
makes
no
difference,
we're
going
to
value
them
the
same.
but
i,
as
a
banker,
i
think
that
urban
real
estate
is
really
going
to
flop.
i'm
the
only
one,
but,
you
know,
that's
how
people
get
rich.
i
happen
to
think
that.
and
therefore
my
motivation
is
to
get
rid
of
my
urban
holdings
and
acquire
rural
holdings.
but
the
market
is
not
taking
account
of
urban
versus
rural.
those
dumb
people
out
there,
they
think
they're
all
the
same.
but
i,
i
have
a
special
motive.
what
happens?
is
that
an
event
that
would
produce
recognition
or
not?
justice
scalia
no,
i
haven't
said...
i
have
said
the
fair
market
value
is
the
same,
because
the
dumb
people
like...
out
there,
who
create
the
market,
they
think
it's
all
the
same.
that's
how
people
get
rich,
you
know.
they
out
guess
the
market.
the
market
value
is
the
same,
but
i
personally
want
to
get
more
rural
real
estate.
and
you're
saying
that
cannot
be
a
recognizable
event
because
the
market
doesn't
recognize
that
difference?
justice
scalia
you
either
have
to
come
out
with
a...
what
seems
to
me
a
silly
position
on
that
hypothetical,
or
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
you're
applying
a
subjective
test
and
not
an
objective
test.
justice
scalia
just
me.
nobody
else.
justice
scalia
what
about
bonds?
do
they,
do
they
go
with
stock
or
do
they
go
with
mortgage
loans?
justice
scalia
so
if
i
have
computers
do
this
thing
with
bonds,
it's
no
good,
but
if
they
do
it
with
mortgages,
it's
okay?
justice
scalia
--could
i...
for
regular
accounting
purposes,
you
would
have
to
revalue
these
mortgages
even
if
you
didn't
engage
in
a
swap,
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
if
you're
following
normal,
what's
the
organization
that
you
mentioned?
wouldn't
their
normal
procedures
require
you
to
revalue
your
stock
of
mortgages--
justice
scalia
--as
there's
a
decline
in
the
real
estate
market,
whether
or
not
you
trade
them
for
other
mortgages?
