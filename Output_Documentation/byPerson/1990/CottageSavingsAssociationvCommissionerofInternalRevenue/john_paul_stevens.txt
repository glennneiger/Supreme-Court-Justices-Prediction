justice
stevens
they
don't
claim
the
losses
arose
from
the
swap.
they
were
realized
at
the
time
of
the
swap.
they
arose
before
the
swap.
they
were
in
fact
real
losses,
weren't
they?
justice
stevens
so
the
loss
had
arisen
prior
to
the
transaction.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
mutual...
you
could
make
the
same
argument
about
two
mutual
funds
that
pay
the
same
interest
rate
and
they
are
equally
liquid,
they
are
both
short
term
funds,
and
one
is
the
first
national
bank
and
the
other
is
the
chase
manhattan
bank,
or
something.
and
the
average
person
in
the
market
would
think
that's
tweedle-dum
and
tweedle-dee,
wouldn't
he?
justice
stevens
of
course
with
a
mutual
fund
you
wouldn't
care
because
it's
not
recognized
under...
what
is
it,
1031...
anyway.
exchange
of
like
kind,
but
it's
not--
justice
stevens
--oh,
it
is
recognized?
justice
stevens
of
course
then
the
rights
and
obligations
are
exactly
the
same,
too,
but
that's
not
like
saying
that
100
homes
in
north
carolina
are
identical
to
100
homes
in
south
carolina,
one
in
the
cities
and
another
in
the
country.
there's
surely
a
lot
of
difference
between
the
underlying
assets.
justice
stevens
you're
just
saying
there's
no
difference
in
the
risk.
but
i
don't
know
why
that's
any
different
than
exchanging
general
motors
bonds
for
chrysler
bonds
having
precisely
the
same
par
value
and
interest
as...
and
the
reason
you
do
it
is
because
the
tax
benefit
you
get
far
exceeds
whatever
trivial
difference
there
is
in
risk.
that's
the
only
motivation--
justice
stevens
--and
it's
a
perfectly
legitimate
motivation.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
you
say
that
doesn't
matter.
if
they
just
picked
it
out
of
the
air
and
it
just
happened
to
come
out
this
way
it
would
be
the
same
thing.
justice
stevens
i
think
you're
really
making
a
subjective
test
argument.
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
give
you
another.
supposing
in
this
very
case
you
had
the
same
economic
analysis,
but
in
addition
to
the
tax
motivation
one
of
the
traders
said
we'd
like
to
concentrate
more
of
our
loans
in
urban
areas,
and
the
other
one
said
we
want
to
move
into
rural
areas,
just
as
a
matter
of
policy.
so
they
selected
rural
versus
urban,
but
came
up
with
the
same
economic
analysis
you
have
in
this
case.
is
that...
would
you
realize
a
loss
or
not
then?
justice
stevens
no,
they
just
want
to
advertise
to
the
public
we're
an
urban
loan
mortgage
company
or
something.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
judgment
of
which
will
get
paid
out
faster,
they
just
liked
to...
or
they
wanted
to
have
them
all
in
the
northeast
instead
of
the
southeast,
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
but
why
then
is
that
different
from
general
motors
versus
at&t?
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
well,
but
these
are
different
areas
of
the
country,
different
types
of
property,
and
you've
got
90
percent
of
twice
as
many
loans
instead
of
100
percent
of
half
as
many
loans...
i
mean,
90
percent
and
10
percent.
you've
got
an
interest
in
a
portfolio
twice
as
large
as
the
one
you
started
with,
too.
justice
stevens
you
just
say
they're
not
material.
justice
stevens
what
about
two
different
issues
of
texaco
bonds?
you
know,
they
do
them
periodically.
both
due
in
1991,
both
the
same
interest
rate.
justice
stevens
and
then
the
next
question
if
you
say
well,
that's
the
same,
then
what
if
they're
slightly
different
in
interest
or
maturity,
but
market
value
is
precisely
the
same
because
one
is
discounted
to
99
and
the
other
is
101?
justice
stevens
is
there
material
difference
or
not
between
two
bond
issues
of
the
same
corporation?
justice
stevens
they're
not
identical,
but
they're
identical
in
market
value.
justice
stevens
well,
one's
a
slightly
higher
interest
rate
and
slightly
different
maturity,
but
the,
but
it
all
washes
out
when
you
trade
it
at
the
time
because
you
buy
it
at
a
discounted
rate.
justice
stevens
it
would
be
materially
different.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
they're
a
lot
more
alike
than
what
you've
got
here.
justice
stevens
yes,
you
changed
the
interest
rate
on
the
coupon,
but
the
effective
interest
rate,
because
you
buy
it
at
a
discount,
is
precisely
the
same.
when
you
buy
bonds
on
the
market,
you
don't
buy
them
at
par.
