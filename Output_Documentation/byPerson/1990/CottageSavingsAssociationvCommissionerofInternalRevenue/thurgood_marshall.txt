justice
thurgood
marshall
the
third
case,
cottage
savings
association
versus
the
commissioner,
no.
89-1965,
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
lending
institution
may
realize
tax
deductible
losses
by
exchanging
its
mortgage
loans
for
mortgage
loans
held
by
other
financial
institutions.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
such
transaction
does
give
rise
to
realized
losses.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice

joins.
