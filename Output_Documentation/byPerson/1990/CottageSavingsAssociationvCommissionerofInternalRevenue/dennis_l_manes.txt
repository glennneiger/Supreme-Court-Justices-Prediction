mr.
dennis
l.
manes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
cottage
savings
association
case
involves
a
1980
transaction
between
cottage
savings
association
and
other
savings
and
loan
institutions
regulated
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board.
this
case
is
representative
of
numerous
other
transactions
that
were
done
during
the
same
time
period
throughout
the
country.
this
transaction
occurred
during
a
very
difficult
time
period
for
the
savings
and
loan
industry.
there
was
a
point
in
time
when
savings
and
loans
were
caught
in
a
cash
squeeze.
interest
rates
were
spiralling
upward,
and
the
institutions
were
watching
their
funds
that
they
currently
held
or
that
normally
would
flow
into
the
savings
institution
be
depleted
and
put
into
higher
money
market
yielding
type
funds.
in
order
to
maintain
the
funds
that
it
had
or
attract
new
funds,
the
savings
and
loan
institutions
had
to
attract
these
funds
by
giving
higher
interest
rates.
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
was
not
a
source
of
funds
because
they
also
were
charging
high
interest
rates
to
the
member
institutions.
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
cottage
and
other
savings
and
loan
institutions
were
straddled
with
low-rate,
long-term
fixed
mortgages.
as
a
result,
their
earnings
were
declining,
since
interest
paid
on
deposits
that
they
were
able
to
maintain
or
attract
far
exceeded
the
income
flow
from
the
fixed-term
mortgages
that
they
held.
in
effect
the
savings
institutions
were
lending
long
and
borrowing
short.
the
future
did
not
look
good
for
cottage
or
other
savings
and
loan
institutions.
then
something
happened.
an
agency
of
the
government,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
stepped
up
to
the
plate
for
its
industry
and
adopted
r-49.
the
stated
objective
of
r-49,
which
was
a
promulgation
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
was
to
create
a
transaction
that
would
cause
a
loss
for
tax
purposes,
and
not
require
the
savings
institution
to
book
the
loss
from
a
regulatory
standpoint.
the
effect
to
the
savings
institution
on
their
net
worth
requirement
was
negative
if
they
entered
into
one
of
these
transactions,
and
the
sponsoring
organization
was
recognizing
that
the
policy
of
these
transactions
was
to
create
a
loss
for
tax
purposes.
cottage
and
other
savings
institutions
were
in
a
terrible
financial
situation,
and
they
really
had
two
choices.
one,
they
could
sit
back
and
watch
their
net
worth
further
erode,
and
possibly
taking
it
below
the
net
worth
requirements
that
were
in
existence,
or
two,
follow
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board's
transaction,
the
transaction
that
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
promulgated
and
endorsed,
and
enter
into
a
transaction
that
would
create
a
loss
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that's
correct.
we
did
not--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--get
a
guarantee
from
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that
was
not
done
in
the
cottage
situation,
no.
there
was--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--that's
correct.
but
it
was
an
agency
of
the
government
that
was--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--that's
correct,
but--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
but
they
also
had
a
stated
objective,
and
the
stated
objective
of
r-49,
as
the
government
recognizes,
was
to
prepare
the
transaction
that
would
produce
the
loss.
and
i
think
that
that's
a...
you
know,
an
important
pronouncement
by
a
governmental
agency,
for
the
government.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
we
were
rolling
the
dice,
so
to
speak,
but
we
did
have
a
pronouncement
from
an
agency
that
had
a
lot
of
authority.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
i'll
accept
that
statement.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that
was
the
effect
of
r-49.
the
effect
of
r-49
was...
as
pointed
out,
was
from
a
regulatory
standpoint,
and
whether
or
not
the
loss
would
be
required
to
be
booked.
and
r-49
wasn't
a
mandatory
provision.
the
taxpayer
had
an
election
to
book
the
loss
or
record
the
loss
from
a
regulatory
standpoint.
but--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--the
accounting
effect
is
that
r-49
was
giving
the
taxpayer
an
option
that
if
r-49
was
followed
they
could
book
the
loss
or
not
book
the
loss.
cottage,
as
well
as
the
industry
at
the
time,
was
under
the
impression
that--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--book
the
loss.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
and
therefore
it
wouldn't
have
any
effect--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--that's
correct,
from
a
tax
standpoint.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
from
accounting
regulatory
standpoint.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
yes,
i
do.
the...
that's
a
point
in
response
to,
you
know,
the
questions
that
i
had
already.
cottage,
as
well
as
the
industry,
thought
the
tax
law
was
pretty
clear,
regardless
of
the
pronouncement
that
i
mentioned
of
the--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--we
do
not
argue
that
issue.
the
courts
that
have
decided
that
point--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that's
correct.
that's
not
an
issue.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
yes.
and
that's
one
of
the
questions
here,
is
to
the
effect
of
the
treasury
regulation
and
what
is
a
material
difference.
the
transaction
was
challenged
by
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
the
basis
of
the
challenge
from
the
internal
revenue
service
was
the
regulation
that
you're
referring
to.
the
basis
of
the
challenge
is
that
the
property
that
cottage
exchanged
was
not
materially
different
than
the
property
that
it
had
received.
our
position
is
that
we're
really
talking
about
some
basic
tax
concepts
here,
and
these
concepts
are
elementary
in
the
tax
law.
and
the
concepts
are
of
realization
and
recognition.
and
the
test
for
realization
is
a
all-encompassing
type
of
test.
the
code
itself,
in
section
1001
states
that
you
compute
gain
or
loss
by
taking
the
amount
realized
and
subtracting
from
that
the
adjusted
basis.
and
that's
a...
that's
a
computational
section
recognizing
that
there's
realization.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that's
(a),
correct?
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that's
correct.
code
section
1001(a).
the
code
then
goes
further
and
states
that
these
realized
gains
or
losses
are
to
be
recognized
unless
there's
an
exception
in
subtitle
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
and
congress
has
been
pretty
clear
here
in
section
1001(a),
and
congress
has
been
clear
here
in
the
exceptions
to
the
recognition
rules,
which
is
the
second
test
here
to
determine
if
a
loss
is
to
be
realized,
recognized,
and
deducted.
and
they've
acted
in
various
areas
in
the
question
of
recognition,
and
areas
where
material
difference
is
really
the
test.
and
material
difference
is,
from
what
we
feel,
is
really
a
test
in
recognition.
and
recognition
is
the
result
unless
you're
in
a
specific
exception
of
subtitle
(a).
and
the
government
and...
recognizes
that
there
is
no
applicable
section
here.
what
the
government
is
asking
is
for
the
court
to
write
a
statutory...
or,
i'm
sorry,
excuse
me...
a
nonstatutory
wash
sale
rule
when
congress
has
been--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--the
reference
to
the
regulation
and
the
effect
on
the
statute
is
normally
when
the
statute
is
not
clear.
and
here
the
statute
is
clear.
congress
has
acted
in
the
area.
congress
has
the
test
for
nonrecognition,
and
therefore
there
must
be
realization.
because
in
order
to
get
the
nonrecognition
you
must
have
realization.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
no,
i'm
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
regulation,
for
what
it
says,
which
is
a
statement
that
if
you
meet
the
material
difference
requirement,
then
there
is
realization.
and
it
really
doesn't
say
the
converse,
that
if
you
don't
meet
it
there
is
not
realization.
and
i
think
that's
a--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--it's
not
authorized
by
the
statute--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--it's
not
authorized
by
the
statute,
and
it
doesn't
follow
the
supreme
court
cases
that
that
regulation
was
really
founded
upon.
and
those
supreme
court
cases
were
very
hair-trigger
type
tests
as
to
what
is
material
difference.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
i
am
not--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--i
agree
that
the
regulation...
i'm
not
challenging
the
validity,
per
se,
of
the
regulation.
the
regulation
is
there.
but
the
regulation
is
based
upon
the
early
cases
that
the
government
argued
a
hair-trigger
type
test
for
realization,
and
the
early
cases
really
muddied
the
issue
because
they
kind
of
combined
realization
and
recognition.
and
the
later
portion
of
it,
especially
the
code
itself,
separates
these.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that
regulation
was
based
upon
the
case
law
at
the
time,
which
talked
about
having
something
materially
different.
and
it
was
based
upon
cases
where
the
government
was
arguing
for
a
hair-trigger,
broad-line
approach.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
i
think
that
it
would
be
tested
first
under
realization,
or
realization
would
be--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--i
would
answer
that
as
yes.
and
the
answer
is
based
upon
a
finding
of
realization,
and
also
you
then
would
have
to
look
to
see
if
there
is
an
exception
to
the
recognition
portion.
and
that's
where
congress
legislated.
and
that's
where
congress
has
taken
into
account
material
differences.
material
differences
are
really
a
test
of
recognition.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
yes.
because
eisner
dealt
with
whether
or
not
just
depreciation
itself,
or
just
depreciation
in
the
asset,
whether
or
not
that--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--well,
it's
questionable
whether
that
itself
was
an
event,
whether
a
stock
dividend
would
be
a
triggering
event.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that
would
be
correct.
and
that's
been
handled--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--and
that
really
is
a
question
of
recognition.
and
we
do
have
sections
in
the
code
dealing
with
recognition,
as
to
whether
or
not
that
is
a
taxable
event.
you
have
plenty
of
sections
in
the
reorganization
rules
that
deal
with
this.
another
area,
i
think,
that
supports
this--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--we
feel
we
fall
within
the
definition
or
the
regulation
as
to
what
is
materially
different.
we
feel
we
fall
into
it
whether
it's
a
hair-trigger
or
an
easy
test
to
meet,
which
the
government
normally
argues.
the
government
is
usually
arguing
the
gain
side,
not
the
loss
side,
and
there
they
ask
for
a
hair-trigger
test.
they
asked
for
a
hair-trigger
test
in
weiss
v.
stearn,
where
the
stock
in
the
reorganization
was
in
the
same
state.
and
we
also
feel
that
here
the
asset
itself,
where
you
have
a
different
obligor,
where
you
have
a
different
collateral
securing
that
obligation,
different
real
estate,
and
where
you
have
a
different
stream
of
income
which
has
resulted
from
those
differences,
then
it
is
materially
different.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that
would
be
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
yeah,
which
the
government
is
now
saying
is
a
portion
of
the
material
different
argument.
it's
a...
they're
not
really
arguing
it,
like
the
sixth
circuit
did,
that
it's
a
separate
test.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
or
we
could
say
that
the
government,
and
their
position
is
that
it's
a
material
difference
test,
and
it's
still
satisfied
in
material
difference.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
we
feel
that
on
trades
of
mortgages
you
would
get
the
same
answer.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
we
feel
that
mortgages
are
unique,
especially
with
the
different
obligor
and
different--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--from
a
pure
subjective
point
of
view,
i
think
you're
correct.
from
a
objective
criteria--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--right.
but
there's
still
an
objective
standard
here
where
you
do
have
different
obligors
and
different
collateral,
and
the
history
has
shown
that
these
did
act
differently.
there
was
a
major
difference
between
those
received
and
those
that
were
sold.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
only
within
the
context
of
r-49.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
well,
r-49
was--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--you're
buying
a
potential
stream
of
income
that
will
perform
differently--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--justice
souter,
that
would
depend
upon
what
factors
the
computer
was
looking
at.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
okay,
well--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--i'd
like
to
direct
you
to
fannie
mae,
and
their
amicus
brief,
because
that
issue
was
addressed
there.
and
the
issue
was
that...
and
i
hate
to
refer
back
to
r-49
because
of
the
question,
but
that
r-49
wasn't
a
complete
situation
of
trying
to
bring
these
risks
so
close
together
that
they
would
perform
exactly
the
same.
in
history--
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
--that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that's
correct,
because
there
is
a
lot
of
other
factors
that
would
have
had
to
be
taken
into
account.
the
government
has
raised
the
difference
of
economic
position
between
the
taxpayer
before
and
after
the
transaction
as
a
determining
issue
here,
and
they
raise
it
in
a
very
subjective
analysis.
and
the
internal
revenue
code
hasn't
really
be
built
upon
a
subjective
analysis.
the
internal
revenue
code
has
been
built
upon
objective
facts
that
congress
has
adopted
and
that
we
can
look
at
for
a
result.
and
they
also
state
that
the
economic
position
of
the
taxpayer
had
not
changed
because
this
potential
flow
of
income,
this
stream
of
income
could
turn
out
to
the
be
the
same.
but
it
could
also
turn
out
to
be
different,
which
is
what
happened,
which
shows
that
they
are
materially
different.
and
from
an
economic
position
standpoint,
a
very
important
criteria
of
what
is
the
same
economic
position
was
brought
out
throughout
this
case.
and
that
was
that
cottage,
at
least
in
this
particular
case,
started
out
with
100
percent
mortgage
before
the
transaction.
and
after
the
transaction
it
had
a
90
percent
participation
in
other
mortgages.
and
that
was
determined
to
be
a
transaction
that
put
cottage
in
a
much
less
liquid
position
regarding
its
mortgages
after
the
transaction.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
that...
that's
correct,
because
that's
the
normal
way
that
mortgages
are
bought
and
sold.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dennis
l.
manes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
various
issues
that
were
raised
by
the
government,
and
one
came
up
in
the
context
of
what
if
the
reverse
was
the
situation
and
we
were
arguing
gain.
and
the
answer
to
that
was
that
gain
would
be
realized.
and
that
argument
is
contrary
to
the
argument
that
the
government
raised
in
every
reported
type
case
that
involves...
that
this
body
has
decided,
starting
with
weiss
and
going
through
rockefeller,
fellis,
and
so
forth.
there
the
government
has
always
argued
for
a
hair-trigger
test
as
to
what
is
realization,
that
it
doesn't
take
very
much
of
a
difference,
and
that
the
difference
is
based
upon
objective
items.
for
example,
in
weiss,
whether
or
not
the...
there
were
different
terms
on
the
refunding,
or
on
the
bonds
or
the
stock
that
was
involved.
whether
or
not
they
were
located
in
different
states.
and
these
were
objective
criteria.
the--
another
interesting
point
that
was
alluded
to
is
whether
or
not
this
transaction,
if
it
occurred
today,
at
least
from
a
regulatory
standpoint,
would
be
given
the
same
effect.
and
it's
clear
under
the
statement
of
position
of
the
aicpa,
which
the
regulatory
bodies
would
now
follow
because
the
regulatory
bodies
for
rap
or
regulatory
purposes
follow
general
accounting
principles,
would
require
these
types
of
transactions
to
be
realized
and
recognized
from
a
financial
accounting
standpoint.
and,
you
know,
that
is,
you
know,
consistent
to
the
tax
laws.
realization
should
only
require
two
things.
one,
has
there
been
an
increase
or
decrease
in
value
of
the
asset
involved
from
the
basis
which
you
hold
it,
and
two,
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
sale
or
disposition.

from
there--
mr.

would
be
correct.

it
appears
in

and
then
after
a
realization
is
determined,
you
look
to
the
statutory
authority
that
congress
has
laid
out
to
see
whether
or
not
the
realization
is
to
be
recognized.
and
these
statutory
exceptions
to
recognition
are
very
clear,
and
the
government
is
asking
the
court
to
develop
a
nonstatutory
recognition
rule,
and
they
do
it
in
the
guise
of
realization.
