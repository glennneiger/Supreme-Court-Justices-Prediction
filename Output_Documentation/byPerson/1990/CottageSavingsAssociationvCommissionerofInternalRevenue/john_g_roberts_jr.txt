mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
below
correctly
concluded
that
the
taxpayer,
cottage
savings,
was
not
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
losses
claimed
to
arise
from
its
swap
with
pools
of
substantially
identical
mortgage
loans.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was
a
real
decline
in
the
book
value
of
the
mortgage
loans--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
loss
was
arising
as
time
went
by.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
their
swap
of
pools
of
substantially
identical
mortgage
loans
resulted
in
a
realization
of
that
loss.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
position
would
be
no
gain
would
have
been
realized.
i'd
point
out,
of
course,
that
that
situation
wouldn't
arise,
because
there
would
be
no
need
to
engage
in
a
swap.
gain
would
not
be
realized
simply
by
holding
on
to
the
valuable,
appreciating
mortgages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly
the
same
test,
your
honor.
and
the
fact
that
it
cuts
both
ways
for
our
position
we
think
indicates
that
it
is
a
neutral
position
in
the
tax
code,
and
not
simply
something
we're
trying
to--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
economic
value--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
think
you
should
look
at
all
the
available
evidence
presented,
and
see
if
the
difference
had
a
capacity
to
affect
the
decision.
now
here
all
the
available
evidence
indicates
that
the
differences
that
cottage
now
relies
on,
differences
in
borrowers,
differences
in
collateral,
were
of
no
significance
to
any
parties
to
the
transaction--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
has
been
labelled--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
former.
it
is
an
objective
test.
we've...
my
brother
has
labelled
it
subjective,
but
it
is
not.
we've
looked
to
the
conduct
and
the
intent
of
the
parties
as
probative
evidence
for
the
objective
nature
of
the
transaction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
the
mutual
funds--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
mutual
funds
are
not
matched
up
the
way
that
these
pools
of
mortgages
were.
in
the
first
place,
the
mutual
funds
are
run
by
separate
management
companies
who
may
have
different
perspectives
on
how
to--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
if
you're
considering
to...
whether
to
invest
in
a
mutual
fund,
you
want
to
know
who
the
management
of
the
fund
is,
you
want
to
know
what
their
investment
philosophy
is.
here--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
in
the
secondary
mortgage
market.
it
is
not
a
factor.
in
fact
at
the
time
of
the
transaction
cottage
conducted
no
credit
checks
of
the
borrowers,
no
appraisal
of
the
properties.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
strong
evidence
of
what
the
nature
of
the
transaction
is.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
am
saying
that
these
particular
traders
didn't
care
who
the
mortgagors
were,
but
not
that
that
is
the
critical
factor,
but
it's
evidence
of
the
objective
nature
of
the
transaction.
if
you
were
engaged
in
the
secondary
mortgage
market,
you
wouldn't
care
who
the
mortgagors
were.
you
don't
go
into
that
market
and
say--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
a
secondary--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
it's
not.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
result
is
going
to
be
different
depending
upon
the
subjective
reactions
of
the
different
traders
and
the
different
r-49
transactions.
we
think
they
all
point
the
same
way.
none
of
these
traders
cared
who
the
borrowers
were
or
what
the
collateral
was.
in
the
secondary
mortgage
market
you
don't
go
in
and
say
i
have
tim
smith's
mortgage
on
148
oak
street,
what
am
i
bid.
you
say
i've
got
a
$150,000
30-year
note
secured
by
a
single
family
residence
in
virginia,
fair
market
value
of
$75,000,
loan-to-value
ratio
of
80
percent.
in
other
words,
the
precise
factors
set
forth
in
memorandum
r-49.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
market
i'm
describing,
not
just
these
traders.
these
transactions
in
the
market
aren't
based
on
who
the
borrower...
if
someone--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
average
person
in
the
market
wants
to
know
before
he
puts
his
money
in
a
mutual
fund
what
the
management
is,
what
their
philosophy
is,
what
the
holdings.
that's
the
prospectus
to
tell
you
what
the
different
holdings
are.
that's
not
how
this
market
works.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
under
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
think
the
irs
regards
different
mutual
funds
as
being
of
like
kind.
they
certainly
don't
regard
different
issuers
of
stock
as
being
of
like
kind,
and
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
difference
in
the
mutual
fund
context.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
so
much
in
the
tax
court
in
this
case.
there
was
a
finding
in
the
centennial
case
along
those
lines,
and
cottage
has
indicated
that
the
facts
of
its
case
are
similar
to
the
facts
of
those...
that...
those
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
centennial,
by
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
know
who
the
traders
are,
but
you
have
to
know
the
market.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
could
be
in
a
particular
case,
if
there
is,
if
it
turns
out
that
south
dakota
wheat
is...
sells
at
a
premium
to
kansas
wheat,
then
you
do
have
to
know.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
identifying
the
market,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
an
example
we
put
forth
in
our
brief
is
serial
numbers
on
stock
certificates.
do
those
make
a
material
difference?
it
depends
what
market
you're
in.
if
you're
in
the
market
where
the
shares
represent
shares
in
a
company,
you
don't
care
what
serial
number
your
share
of
ibm
has
when
you
swap
it
for
another.
but
there
is
also
a
market
out
there
for
antique
shares,
and
you
want
to
make
certain
when
you're
trading
that
you're
getting
ibm
share
0001.
it
does
make
a
difference.
you
can't
simply
say
as
an
abstract
matter
serial
numbers
on
stock
certificates
make
no
difference.
it
does
depend
on
the
market,
and
it
does
depend
on
how
parties
in
that
market
treat
the
characteristic.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well...
it
is
unavoidable,
i
think,
in
the
realization
inquiry
to
ask,
as
the
regulation
sets
forth,
whether
the
properties
are
materially
different.
that
is
in
fact
a
fact-specific
inquiry
set
forth
in
the
regulations.
but
i
don't
want
the
irony
of--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
was
intended
to
define
and
clarify
the
concept
that
the
court
began
to
articulate
in
the
decisions
in
the
1920's.
those
decisions,
of
course,
did
not
address
the
entire
range
of
issues
in
which
the
realization
question
could
arise,
so
i
would
assume--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
differences
that
are
relied
upon
in
the
exchange
of
property
have
to
be
material
differences,
differences
that
make
a
difference.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
are
put
forth
by
the
taxpayer
in
response
to
the
challenge
that
that
was
just
an
exchange
of
property
that
was
not
materially
different.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
are
not
different
risks
of
repayment.
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
value
of
the
mortgage
loans
that
are
traded,
that
value,
it's
an
asset
that
measures
risk.
that's
what
people
want
to
know.
and
the
question
is
what
characteristics
do
you
look
at
to
effect
risk.
here
the
market
does
not
look
at
who
the
particular
borrower
is
or
what
the
collateral
is.
the
parties
certainly
had
no
interest
in
that.
they
were
willing
to
swap
these
without
any
regard
to
who
the
borrowers
were
or
what
the
collateral
was,
and
the
bank
board,
the
federal
agency
charged
with
regulating
this
industry
specifically
said
that
if
you
meet
these
criteria,
and
you...
those
things
are
then
substantially
identical.
and
if
you
swap
them
your
economic
position
is
not
going
to
change.
and
therefore...
i
don't
want
the
irony
of
their
position
to
be
lost.
at
the
time
they
went
through
a
carefully
crafted
transaction
to
ensure
that
what
they
were
giving
up
would
be
substantially
identical
to
what
they
were
getting
back.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
net
worth
doesn't
change.
if
you,
before
you
had
property
worth
$10,000
and
now
you
have
$10,000
in
cash,
but
your
economic
position
changes
dramatically,
because
you
are
holding
very
different
assets.
here,
before
and
after
the
transaction--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you're
worth
the
same
before
the
transaction
and
after.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
agree.
but
you're
holding
a
very
different
economic
asset.
before
the
transaction--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--before
the
transaction
you
had
shares
in
stock,
and
they
could
go
up
and
could
go
down.
after
the
transaction
you
simply
had
cash.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
you
mean
your
worth,
what
you're
worth,
that
hasn't
changed.
but
you
have
engaged
in
a
transaction
that
would
realize
either
loss
or
gain
because
you've
disposed
of
a
piece
of
property
that
you
owned.
here
that
really
didn't
happen.
in
the
swap
cottage
got
back
exactly
what
it
gave
up--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
just
that
they
didn't
care--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that
fact,
future
performance,
was
unknown
and
unknowable
at
the
time
of
the
transaction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
respect,
your
honor,
the
subsequent
performance
does
not
show
that,
because
what
the
asset
measures
at
the
time
is
risk.
and
the
risk
at
the
time,
according
to
the
r-49
criteria,
according
to
the
perspective
of
the
market,
according
to
the
perspective
of
the
bank
board,
was
exactly
the
same.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
stock--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
because
there
are
material
differences
in
the...
in
an
exchange
of
stock
the
material
difference
is
in
the
issuers.
the
fact
that
they
coincide--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it's
like
a
sinking
fund
bond.
a
company
issues
these
bonds
and
they
are
going
to
retire,
say,
10
percent
of
them
every
year,
and
they
pick
which
ones
to
retire
in
a
lottery.
at
the
time
that
those
bonds
are
sold
there
is
a
risk,
10
percent
risk
that
it
would
be
retired
after
the
first
year,
and
that
would
change
the
subsequent
performance.
but
those
two
bonds
have
exactly
the
same
risk,
they're
worth
exactly
the
same
on
the
day
they
are
issued.
one
of
them
is
going
to
perform
very
different
than
the
other
nine,
but
you
don't
know
which
one,
and
the
risk
at
that
time
is
precisely
the
same.
and
that's
what
these
assets
measure.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
underlying
assets.
and
that
we're
not
saying
there's
no
difference
in
who
the
borrowers
are,
what
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--here
it's
not
simply
the
fact
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--here
it's
not
simply
the
fact
that
the
value
coincides,
that
the
risk
is
the
same.
the
reason
the
value
coincides,
the
risk
is
the
same,
is
because
cottage
and
its
trading
partners
went
through
an
elaborate
transaction--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
could
happen
to
have
the
same
risk,
but
we
wouldn't
say
they
are
not
therefore
materially
different.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
transaction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
of
the
market.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
no,
the
tax--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--law
doesn't
look
at
idiosyncracies
in
particular
taxpayers.
if
one
of
these
parties
said--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
would
be
no
different
than
if
one
of
these
trading
partners
decided
it
was
only
going
to
swap
loans
that
happen
to
have
red
folders
and
not
green
ones.
they
said
just
give
me
the
red
ones
and
not
the
green
ones.
that
type
of
idiosyncracy
would
not
be
taken
into
account
in
the
tax
law.
but
we
do
need
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
market
to
decide
what
are
material
differences.
there
is
no
way
to
say
as
an
abstract
matter,
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
centennial
case
did,
that
we
know
that
the
borrowers
and
collateral
make
a
difference.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
wouldn't.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
a
rational,
economic--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that
of
course
is
the
argument
that
fannie
mae
raises
in
the
centennial
case
where
it's
filed
in
an
amicus
brief.
it
would
be
the
same
analysis
in
that
case,
because
the
differences
in
the
location
alone
did
not
have
any
effect
on
the
market
or
on
the
value.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
position
that
they're
advancing
is,
is
somewhat
inherently
inconsistent.
they're
saying,
for
example,
that
the
urban
loans
are
going
to
prepay
faster,
or--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
factor
that's
extrinsic
to
the
market
like
that,
and
that
has
no
effect
on
value,
i
don't
think
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
because
general
motors
and
at&t
are
shares
of
stock
in
two
very
different
corporations.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
not...
we're
not
saying
there
are
not
differences.
there
are
differences.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
not
material
differences,
because
they
make
no
difference
to
the
market
or
to
the
bank
board.
the
bank
board--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--then
you
couldn't
have
done
an
r-49
transaction,
because
one
of
the
things
you
had
to
make
certain
of
in
your
r-49
transaction
was
that
the
fair
market
value
of
the
loans
you're
swapping
were
the
same.
and
if
you
didn't
think
they
were,
then
you
couldn't
go
to
the
bank
board
and
say
i
have
no
loss,
these
are
the
same.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
still
think
you
can't
engage
in
an
r-49
transaction
because
you
would
have
to
report...
you
would
have
to
tell
the
bank
board--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well...
i'm
not
sure
how
much
difference
it
makes
whether
you
attach
the
label
subjective
or
objective.
our
position
is
that
you
look
to
the
conduct
and
the
intent
of
the
parties
as
probative
evidence
of
the
nature
of
the
transaction
in
which
they
engaged.
now,
if
people
were
making
those
judgments,
that
these
loans
were
in
fact
different,
i
think
they're
going
to
do
better.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
you.
then
we'd
have
to
look
at
the
other
evidence
and
see
if
that
meant
that
that
characteristic
was
or
should
be
considered
a
material
difference
in
these
transactions.
here
all
of
the
parties,
not
just
in
this
case
and
the
other
cases,
did
not
regard
the
differences
that
are
now
cited
after
the
fact
as
material...
as
material
at
the
time.
the
bank
board
didn't.
the
bank
board's
job
in
the,
issuing
these
accounting
standards
was
to
keep
track
of
how
the
position
of
the
s&l's
changed.
and
they
said
if
you
match
these
up
according
to
the
r-49
criteria
and
you
swap
those
loans,
your
position
is
not
changed;
you're
substantially
identical.
and
now
they
want
to
come
back
and
say
that
the
substantially
identical
loans
are
actually
materially
different.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals,
first
of
all,
was
wrong
to
conclude
that
there
was
no
materially
different
requirement.
we
think
there
it.
it's
set
forth
in
a
regulation
that
has
been
in
effect
since
1935.
second--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
rejected
our
argument
that
there
is
a
materially
different
requirement
in
the
tax
law--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
we
think
that
was
wrong.
the
requirement
is
set
forth
in
the
regulation
which
has
been
in
effect
since
1935,
and
this
court
has
frequently
noted
the
deference
that
is
due
treasury
regulations.
now,
if
the
court
rejects
that
position,
if
this
court
rejects
that
position
and
agrees
with
the
sixth
circuit
that
there
is
no
materially
different
requirement,
then
we
think
that
the
same
reasons
that
we
advanced
in
the
materially
different
context
should
be
applied
under
section
165.
so
we're
not--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
is
no
materially
different
requirement--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
then
the
same
arguments
it
applied
in
the
165
pigeon
hole.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
if
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
question,
we
agree
with
it.
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
think
so.
we
think
it's
properly
addressed
under
the
realization
rubric,
because
that's
where
the
treasury
regulation
is,
and
that
regulation
is
entitled
to
deference
and
can
be
applied.
but
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that,
then
we
don't
think
a
loss
has
been
sustained,
because,
by
the
nature
of
the
transaction,
cottage
got
back
something
that
was
substantially
identical
to
what
it...
to
what
it
gave
up.
now,
my
brother
hasn't
mentioned
exactly
what
the
r-49
criteria
are,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
that
in
mind.
they
were
very...
10
very
precise
criteria
that
had
to
be
matched,
and
they
were
matched
by
computer
before
the
swap
could
take
place.
loans
had
to
be
secured
by
a
single
family
residence
in
the
same
state,
they
had
to
have
the
same
terms
for
30-year
loan,
had
to
be
the
same
type,
conventional
for
conventional,
same
interest
rate,
similar
seasoning,
principal
amount,
swapped
without
recourse,
similar
fair
market
value,
similar
loan-to-value
ratio.
those
were
all
matched
up,
and
when
those
were
all
matched
up
the
parties
were
willing
to
swap
those
straight
up.
differences
in
borrowers
and
collateral
or
some
of
the
differences
that
justice
scalia
were
talking
about,
if
those
made
a
difference
they
would
have
entered
into
the
calculation
of
the
value.
they
would
have
said
here
are
loans
matched
up
according
to
r-49.
do
you
want
to
trade?
and
you
say
no,
i
think
urban
loans
are
going
to
be
more
valuable,
mine
is
worth

or
i
think
this
borrower
is
less
of

yours
is
worth

but
that
didn't
happen.
same
discount
factor.
they
matched
the
two
loans
up;
they
were
each
sold
for
62
percent
of
book
value.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
the
value
would
be
the
same
in
that
case,
but
that's
not
all
we're
saying.
it's
not
simply
the
fact
that
the
value
is
the
same.
the
value
is
the
same
because
they
are
matched
up
according
to
the
factors
that
the
market
considers
in
arriving
at
an
assessment
of
risk.
that's
not
the
case
in
just
matching
up
baskets
of
stock
so
that
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
is
a
material
difference
between
texaco
stock
and
exxon
stock.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
companies
are
different
and
the
shares
represent
a
share
in
those
companies.
here
the
sole
purpose
of
the
mortgage
loan
in
the
secondary
mortgage
market
is
to
measure
risk.
and
here
the
bank
board
told
you
what
you
had
to
match
up
to
make
sure
the
risks
were
the
same,
and
then
said
if
you
did
that
you
could
swap
them.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
if
someone
were
investing
in
a
bond,
they'd
want
to
know
whose
bond
it
is.
in
the
secondary
mortgage
market
someone
who
is
investing
in
these
pools
of
substantially
identical
mortgage
loans
doesn't
say
who
is
the
borrower
on
that
originally,
or
what
condition
is
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it's
not
just
the
fact
that
the
computers
are
doing
it.
it's
that
the
market
treats
it
differently.
most
parties
are
going
to
treat
it
differently.
and
they
are
different.
a
texaco
bond,
no
matter
how
closely
matched,
is
different
than
an
exxon
bond.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
there
is
line
drawing--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
they're
identical,
there
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
then
we
need
to
know
what
the
differences
are.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
believe
that
those
would
be
found
to
be
materially
different--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
of
the
difference
in
the
terms.
all
of
the...
all
of
the
terms
that
the
market--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
if
you're
trading
bonds
on
the
market,
the
first
thing
you're
going
to
ask,
of
course,
is
whose
bond
is
it
and
what's
the
interest
rate.
so
a
change
in
interest
rate
is
going
to
be
different.
here
the
only
things
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
it's
going
to
make
a
difference.
it's
going
to
make
a
difference
to
the
rational
economic
trader
which
bond
he
has.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there
again
it's
sort
of
like
the
mutual
fund
example.
the
differences
in
the
management,
how
they're
going
to
trade
the
bonds
is
something
that
would
be
a
material
difference.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
distinction
is
partly
in
the
market.
i
mean,
we're
familiar
with
how
important
who
the
borrower
is
and
what
the
collateral
is
when
you
take
out
a
mortgage
on
your
home.
but
the
market
in
pools
of
these
mortgage
loans
doesn't
work
that
way.
they
don't
care
who
the
borrower
is.
they
want
to
know
what's
the
fair
market
value,
what's
the
loan-to-value
ratio,
what's
the
interest
rate,
what's
the
seasoning,
in
other
words
the
factors
that
are
set
forth
in
memorandum
r-49.
these
other
differences
did
not
make
a
difference
to
the
market,
did
not
make
a
difference
to
the
parties
acting
in
that
market,
and
did
not
make
a
difference
to
the
bank
board.
the
swap
pools
of
mortgages
loans
were
therefore
not
materially
different
under
the
treasury
regulation
as
interpreted
by
the
commissioner,
and
therefore
did
not
result
in
a
realized
loss.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
just
the
value,
it's
the
factors
that
went
into
determining
value.
and
the
whole
purpose
of
memorandum
r-49
was
to
make
sure
that
the
factors
that
went
into
determining
value
were
matched
up
precisely.
thank
you,
your
honor.
