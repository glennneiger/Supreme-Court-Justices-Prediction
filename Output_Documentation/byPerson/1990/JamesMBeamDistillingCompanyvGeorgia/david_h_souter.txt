justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
before
1985,
georgia
law
imposed
an
excise
tax
on
imported
liquor
at
double
the
rate
it
imposed
on
liquor
manufactured
from
gerogia-grown
products.
in
1984,
this
court
in
bacchus
imports
limited
against
dias
held
that
a
similar
hawaii
law
violated
the
commerce
clause.
petitioner,
manufacturer
and
distributor
of
kentucky
bourbon,
thereafter,
filed
an
action
in
the
georgia
state
court
seeking
a
refund
of
taxes
it
had
paid
under
georgia's
law
for
the
years
1982,
'83,
and
'84.
on
the
basis
of
our
decision
in
bacchus,
the
court
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional
but
refused
to
apply
its
ruling
on
a
retroactive
basis
and
thus,
denied
petitioner's
request
for
a
refund.
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
and
the
petitioners
sought
review
by
this
court
on
the
retroactivity
question.
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
case
remanded.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
in
which
justice
stevens
joins,
i
conclude
that
because
bacchus
applied
its
own
rule
retroactively
to
the
litigants
there
before
the
court,
the
rule
must
also
be
so
applied
to
the
parties
in
this
case.
i
believe
this
result
to
be
demanded
by
principles
of
equality
and
stare
decisis
which
do
not
allow
this
court
to
apply
new
rules
of
law
on
a
selective
basis.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
marshall
and
justice
scalia
join;
justice
scalia
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun
join.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
join.
