mr.
morton
siegel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
james
b.
beam
distilling
company
is
an
out-of-state
producer
of
alcoholic
beverages.
under
the
taxing
scheme
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
beam
was
required
to
pay
an
excise
tax
at
twice
the
rate
as
producers
of
alcoholic
beverages
within
the
state
of
georgia.
the
georgia
supreme
court
agreed
that
that
tax
was
unconstitutional
because
beam
was
not
a
producer
in
state.
the
tax,
they
concluded,
followed
this
court's
long
line
of
commerce
clause
discriminatory
taxing
structures,
and
said
that
it
was
parochial,
protectionist,
and
it
only
benefitted
the
in-state
producers.
thus,
the
tax
is
similar
to
the
tax
that
this
court
reviewed
in
bacchus.
georgia
in
fact
has
a
clear
prescribed
remedy
under
both
the
statute
that
the
refund
was
filed
under
as
well
as
its
own
constitution.
beam
was
denied
a
refund
because
the
georgia
supreme
court
refused
to
retroactively
apply
its
decision.
therefore
retroactivity
of
bacchus
is
now
before
this
court.
mr.
morton
siegel
the
first
year
of
the
refund
was
1982
through
1984,
so
it
covers
a
period
prior
to
your
decision
in
bacchus.
mr.
morton
siegel
georgia
had
no
predeprivation
statute.
the
relief
that
they
provide
by
statute
is
post
remedy.
the
only
way
that
beam
could
do
business,
the
only
way
that
they
could
ship
product
into
the
state
is
if
they
paid
this
tax.
mr.
morton
siegel
they
paid
it,
indeed,
otherwise
they
would
be
precluded
from
being
able
to
sell
its
fine
products
to
the
people
of
georgia.
georgia
was
wrong
not
to
apply
this
tax
retroactively.
based
upon
the
different
opinions
of
this
court
last
term
in
american
trucking
association,
there
are
two
alternative
ways
to
reach
this
conclusion.
clearly
beam
would
prevail
under
either
of
these
tests.
under
the
view
of
five
of
the
justices,
all
civil
constitutional
decisions
should
be
applied
retroactively.
thus,
the
tax
was
unconstitutional
when
beam
made
its
very
first
payment
in
1982.
the
per
se
rule
would
therefore
result
in
a
reversing
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
on
retroactivity
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
purposes
of
considering
the
remedy.
if
the
court
was
to
adopt
the
view
of
the
plurality
in
the
american
trucking
association
case,
as
it
recognized
the
narrow
exception
that
is
set
forth
in
the
three-step
test
of
chevron,
then
it
would
be
the
burden
of
the
state
to
show,
as
the
court
explained
in
ashland
oil,
that
first
the
decision
of
the
court
was
overruling
a
clear
past
precedent
on
which
litigants
may
have
relied,
or
it
must
be
an
issue
of
first
impression
which
resolution
was
not
clearly
foreshadowed.
bacchus
may
be
subject
to
differing
viewpoints,
but
bacchus
in
terms
of
its
analysis
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
not
revolutionary.
it
was
not
shocking.
bacchus
contributed
to
the
continuing
jurisprudence
of
the
commerce
clause--
mr.
morton
siegel
--that
is
the
effect
of
what
i
see
coming
out
of
the
ashland
language,
although
it
was
per
curia.
the
language
that
was
implied
in
there
is
that
some
type
of
strike
of
lightning,
so
that
perhaps
there,
as
i
pointed
out,
there
may
be
differing
viewpoints.
i
fully
recognize
that
three
justices
dissented
in
bacchus.
but
i
don't
believe
that
when
bacchus
was
decided
anyone
was
taken
by
surprise,
if
we
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
the
commerce
clause
cases,
or
indeed
if
we
look
at
any
other
direction
where
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
judged
in
view
of
other
constitutional
principles.
it
is
on
that
point,
the
test
of
the
plurality,
that
i
would
like
to
continue
with
my
remarks.
the
state
would
argue
that
young's
market
is
the
controlling
case
here.
young's
market
was
decided
shortly
after
the
country
went
through
the
noble
experience
of
prohibition.
it
reflected,
and
i
think
there
is
some
significance
to
this,
the
viewpoint
that
national
control
of
the
industry
was
not
appropriate,
that
each
state
should
be
able
to
determine
whether
it
or
not
it
desires
to
permit
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
or
not
to
permit
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages.
i
would
submit,
however,
that
if
i
was
a
lawyer
working
for
the
state
of
georgia,
understanding
full
well
that
there
may
be
some
respectful
disagreement
on
this
point,
and
i
was
to
look
in
the
year
1982
at
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
from
1934...
from
1930
forward,
i
would
clearly
see
the
hostetter
v.
idlewild
decision
in
1964,
where
a
majority
of
the
court
took
a
look
at
the
twenty-first
amendment,
looked
back
on
the
cases
that
had
been
decided
in
the
1930's,
and
acknowledged
the
fact
that
the
states
were
totally
unconfined
when
it
restrains
the
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages
destined
for
use.
but
the
court
then
went
on
to
say,
to
draw
a
conclusion
from
this
line
of
cases,
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
been
repealed
is
absurd,
and
they
went
on
to
say
it
is
bizarre
and
incorrect.
at
that
point
the
court
stated
that
the
twenty-first
amendment,
like
other
provisions
in
the
constitution,
must
be
considered
as
it
relates
to
the
very
factual
setting,
and
it
must
take
into
account
whatever
competing
constitutional
provisions
are
applicable.
mr.
morton
siegel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
siegel
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
your
honor,
james
beam
distilling
company,
like
other
out-of-state
distillers,
engages
in
business
in
all
50
states.
every
state
has
a
pervasive
system
of
regulation.
the
regulations
vary
from
state
to
state.
the
beam
distilling
company
is
not
in
the
business
of
filing
lawsuits.
it
rather
would
devote
its
resources
to
doing
business,
nor
does
it
look
kindly
upon
the
prospect
of
filing
suit
against
state
government,
the
very
institution
that
regulates
it.
however,
when
this
court
spoke
in
1984
in
bacchus,
it
reignited
our
interest
in
these
discriminatory
taxing
statutes,
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
they
sat
down
and
decided
that
after
all
they
were
at
a
great
disadvantage
doing
business
in
the
state.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
they
elected
to
file
the
claim
after
the
bacchus
decision
came
down.
so
clearly
the
difference
here
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
3-year
statutory
period
for
a
refund
prior
to
bacchus,
as
opposed
to
the
case
that
you
reviewed
in
mckesson.
if
that
georgia
lawyer
was
to
continue
on
into
the
1970's
it
would
take
a
look
at
craig
v.
boren,
which
applied
the
principles
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
it
relates
to
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
they
concluded
at
that
time
that
gender
based
discrimination
could
not
be
tolerated
even
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
case
that
i
feel
most
clearly
drives
home
the
point
that
we
may
have
differing
viewpoints
as
to
how
the
earlier
1930
cases
were
interpreted,
i
would
contend
first
of
all
that
the
reasoning
in
those
cases
has
been
totally
repudiated
at
this
point.
it
may
well
be
the
opportunity
for
the
court
to
consider
that
point.
what
i
think
is
important
about
midcal
is
that
it
looked
back
and
it
took
a
look
at
the
historical
development
of
this
fascinating
twenty-first
amendment.
it
acknowledged
that
some
of
the
decisions
of
the
court
have
dealt
squarely
with
the
express
terms
of
section
2.
it
also
acknowledged
that
in
some
instances
it
applied
a
much
broader
application
in
the
interpretation
of
the
amendment.
but
it
made
it
clear
that
where
the
core
powers
of
the
twenty-first
amendment...
importation,
transportation,
and
what
this
court
has
defined
in
midcal
as
distribution...
when
those
core
powers
are
not
involved
in
a
particular
case
the
federal
competing
interests,
so
long
as
there
can
be
shown
that
there
was
a
longstanding
interest
such
as
the...
a
principle
in
favor
of
free
and
open
competition
that
was
the
subject
of
the
midcal
case,
such
as
the
court's
consistent
declaration
of
not
countenancing
any
type
of
discriminatory
taxation--
mr.
morton
siegel
--that
is
correct.
our
position--
mr.
morton
siegel
--i
am,
justice
white,
because
i
don't
think
the
state
can
bear
the
burden
of
satisfying
that
first
prong
in
order
to
get
prospective
relief
in
this
case.
mr.
morton
siegel
if
we
were
to
go
to
the
second
prong,
the
best
example
i
can
give
you
in
the
second
prong
being
that
you
do
not
apply
prospective
relief
in
the
case
if
it
frustrates
the
very
purpose
of
the...
of
the
rule.
here
you
have
a
situation
much
the
same
as
what
you
had
in
florida.
the
original
tax
was
knocked
out.
the
legislature
in
florida
came
right
back.
parochial
indeed,
that
is
precisely
what
the
second
prong
addresses.
georgia
legislature
did
the
same
thing.
it
appears
to
me
as
though
they
have
not
yet
been
willing
to
accept
the
principles
of
this
court
when
it
comes
to
discriminatory
taxation.
and
if
we
were
to
go
to
the
third
point,
which
is
to
take
a
look
at
the
hardship,
we
are
talking
about
a
total
of
$30
million.
that's
a
lot
of
money,
but
it
is
not
going
to
put
the
state
of
georgia
in
a
financial
bind.
at
this
point
then--
mr.
morton
siegel
--my
client,
justice
stevens,
beam,
their
claim
for
refund
is
$2.4
million.
two
other
companies
filed
refunds
as
well.
the
total
is
$30
million
for
this
period.
mr.
morton
siegel
would
we
settle
for
half?
mr.
morton
siegel
that
is
correct.
we
are
looking
for
equality,
the
point
that
you
addressed
in
mckesson.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
[laughter]
and
the
attorney
general
is
here,
be
delighted
to
talk
with
him
right
after
the
hearing.
the
point
is
in
this
entire
discussion
with
regard
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
that
nothing
really
was
revolutionary
when
bacchus
came
down
in
terms
of
the
pronouncements
of
this
court.
the
development
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
law
has
been
clear
for
everyone,
and
i
think
that
even
the
georgia
lawyer
that
sat
down
and
took
a
look
at
it
at
that
point
would
have
to
agree
that
there
was
nothing
so
revolutionary--
mr.
morton
siegel
--they
did.
but
even
within
that
context--
mr.
morton
siegel
--i
think
the
decisions
have
been
very,
very
clear
on
this
point,
if
they
were
just
to
take
a
look
at
hostetter.
and
what
is
interesting
about
hostetter
is--
mr.
morton
siegel
--they
did.
and
the
dissenters
pointed
out
as
well
in
hostetter
that
although
they
didn't
agree
with
the
majority,
they
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
change
in
the
decisions
that
we
have
rendered
up
to
this
point
on
the
twenty-first
amendment.
that
is
the
point
of
all
this.
there,
they
weren't
taken
by
surprise.
we
may
differ
as
to
our
analysis,
but
they
were
not
taken
by
surprise.
mr.
morton
siegel
it
did
not
reaffirm
young's
market,
nor
would
i
stand
here
and
tell
you
that
any
of
your
subsequent
decisions
have
totally
overruled
young's
market.
but
what
i
do
feel
has
happened
is
through
the
progression
of
the
decisions
in
the
'60's,
the
'70's,
and
the
'80's...
if
we
were
to
take
a
look
at
the
court's
twenty-first
amendment
decisions
since
1980...
midcal,
rice
v.
williams,
grendle
v.
larkin,
bacchus,
capital
cities...
in
every
instance
except
your
recent
decision
in
north
dakota
you
have
determined
that
the
federal
interest
that
was
competing
with
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
more
significant
than
what
the
state
was
attempting
to
protect.
perhaps
the
one
exception
to
that,
justice
rehnquist,
would
have
been
south
dakota
v.
dole
where
you
really
didn't
get
into
the
twenty-first
amendment
that
much.
that
says
to
me
that
there
has
been
a
historical
progression
here
which
has
looked
back
and
brought
us
up
to
the
1980's.
so
i
think
what
is
significant
about
hostetter
is
the
fact
that
it
rejected
any
notion
that
the
commerce
clause
had
been
repealed.
mr.
morton
siegel
your
honor,
just
as
it
is
my
job
to
advise
my
clients
of
the
development
of
the
law,
it
is
the
job
of
the
attorney
general's
office
or
lawyers
working
in
that
office.
how
many
times
do
we
see
governmental
administrations
come
to
their
legislatures--
mr.
morton
siegel
--clearly
1964
in
my
judgment.
that
is
the
hostetter
decision.
because
they
came
right
out
and
repudiated
what
had
been
the
thinking
up
to
that
point,
and
they
said
any
idea
that
the
commerce
clause
has
been
repealed
is
absurd,
is
incorrect.
that
is
very
strong
language.
and
they
then
went
further
to
state
that
in
any
twenty-first
amendment
case
we
balance
the
constitutional...
competing
constitutional
interests
in
view
of
the
context
of
the
facts
that
are
submitted
at
any
particular
time.
i
think
that
would
have
been
the
point
in
which
the
state
of
georgia
should
have
recognized
that
there
is
a
change
from
the
earlier
rulings
of
this
court
back
in
1930.
so
under
the
chevron
analysis
it
is
our
judgment
that
the
state
of
georgia
cannot
bear
the
burden
of
satisfying
the
first
prong,
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
go
any
further.
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
not
granting
retroactive
relief
should
be
reversed.
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
this
instance,
although
this
case
is
not
directly
involved
with
mckesson,
clearly
there
is
a
prescribed
remedy
under
the
georgia
refund
statute
which
would
allow
our
client
to
get
a
refund
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
mckesson.
thank
you.
mr.
morton
siegel
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
siegel
well,
actually
when
you
are
paying
a
tax,
justice
stevens,
and
you
are
forced
to
pay
it
really
under
duress,
because
if
beam
was
to
ship
goods
into
that
state...
what
happens
is
they
buy
tax
stamps.
if
the
product
comes
in
without
those
stamps
it
will
be
seized
and
their
license
to
do
business
would
be
revoked.
so
they
were
obviously
not
in
agreement
with
what
was
going
on.
they
didn't
file
any
official
protest,
but
when
they
finally
got
around
to
recognizing
that
they
were
going
to
take
advantage
of
the
court's
decision
in
bacchus
they
then
went
ahead
and
protested
every
subsequent
payment.
mr.
morton
siegel
once
you
pay
the
tax
you
are...
yes,
you
are
entitled
to--
mr.
morton
siegel
--that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
siegel
if
we're
talking
about
a
predeprivation
remedy?
mr.
morton
siegel
then
obviously
it
would
have
applied
the
same
way.
and
if
that
would
have
been
the
case--
mr.
morton
siegel
--oh,
absolutely
not.
we
would
have...
if
we
would
have
had
that
opportunity
we
would
have
taken
advantage
of
it.
mr.
morton
siegel
yes.
mr.
morton
siegel
no,
i
don't.
mr.
morton
siegel
i
think
i
could
have,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
state
of
georgia
would
have
paid
much
attention
to
it.
after
all,
in
this
particular
instance
when
we
filed
our
post-remedy
claim
for
refund
they
took
no
action
on
that,
even
after
bacchus.
and
under
the
statute
in
georgia
we
have
the
right
if
the
state
takes
no
action.
so
i
don't
think
it
would
have
meant,
made
any
difference
to
the
state
of
georgia
in
this
instance.
thank
you.
mr.
morton
siegel
just
a
few
minutes,
chief
justice.
thank
you.
although
the
issue
is
not
before
this
court,
i
do
want
to
make
the
point
that
there
has
never
been
a
disagreement
with
the
state
of
georgia
over
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
comply
with
the
protest
procedure
for
claiming
refunds.
it
did
not
technically
say
you
have
to
mark
protest.
it
says
you
file
a
claim
for
refund
and
you
set
forth
the
reasons.
there
has
never
been
any
disagreement
that
for
the
tax
period
involved
in
this
case
we
complied
with
that
procedure.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
certainly
the
burden
should
not
be
on
beam
to
go
beyond
what
the
statutory
structure
of
georgia
provides.
thirdly,
i
would
like
to
just
restate
that
the
general
rule
here
is
in
favor
of
retroactivity.
and
we
may
differ
on
how
we
are
going
to
read
bacchus,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
decision
did
not
come
out
and
reveal
any
new
rules
and...
as
it
applied
to
the
twenty-first
amendment.
therefore,
i
do
not
see
how
the
state
can
get
past
the
first
prong
of
the
chevron
case.
and
in
that
instance
we
would
be
entitled
to
relief,
if
this
court
should
see
fit.
