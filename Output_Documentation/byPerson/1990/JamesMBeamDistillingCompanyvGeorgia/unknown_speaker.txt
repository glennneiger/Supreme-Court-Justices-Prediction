unknown
speaker
what
years
were
in
question?
unknown
speaker
just
out
of
curiosity,
does
georgia
require
that
in
order
to
get
a
refund
the
tax
has
to
be
paid
under
protest?
unknown
speaker
and
they
paid
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
siegel,
do
you
think
that's
the
test
under
the
plurality
view
in...
in
american
trucking
association,
that
it
should
be
shocking
or
revolutionary
in
order
to
be
denied
retroactive
effect?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
siegel,
now,
your
client
didn't
bring
any
challenge
here
until
after
bacchus
was
decided.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
thought
the
law
was
clear
before
bacchus,
apparently.
why
didn't
you
bring
the
challenge
then?
unknown
speaker
all
of
this,
i
take
it,
is
on...
you're
still
on
the
fact
that
that
was
a
plurality
opinion
in
the
case
last
term?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
still
on
the
first
criterion?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
other
prongs?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
on
that
$30
million,
is
that
the
total
amount
collected
or
the
amount
by
which,
is
that
the
discriminatory
increment?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you,
if
they
only
give
the
amount
of
refund
that
the
federal
constitution
mandates
you
would
only
get
1
point...
you
would
only
get
half
of
that
amount,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
all
you
would
be
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
maybe
you
would
get
more
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
three
justices
thought
we
were
pretty
well
doing
away
with
some
prior
precedent,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
so
what
about
a...
what
about
a
state
official?
couldn't...
a
state
official
might
have
been
misled
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
dissenters
took
a
look
at
it.
unknown
speaker
yet
hostetter
purported
to
reaffirm
young's
market,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
at
what
point
was
an
official
in
the
state
of
georgia
on
notice
here
that
young's
market
could
no
longer
be
relied
on?
was
it
back
at
the
time
hostetter
was
decided?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
am
entitled
to
ask
you
a
question,
even
though
you
are
not
consulting
with
the
state
of
georgia,
as
to
when
you
think
someone
consulting
with
the
state
of
georgia
should
have
realized
that
young's
market
was
no
longer
a
good
law.
was
it
at
the
time
of
the
decision
in
the
hostetter
came
down?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
you
mentioned
the
refund
statute.
your
question
presented
in
the
cert.
petition
said
when
a
taxpayer
pays
under
protest
the
states
tax
and
so
forth.
you
left
the
words
"under
protest"
out
of
your
merits
brief.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the,
what
is
the
significance
of
that?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
that
every
taxpayer
in
order
to
ship
into
the
state,
i
mean,
every
liquor
company
must
get
the
stamps,
and
that
is
enough,
that
is
all
the
protest
you
need
in
order
to
file
a
refund
action.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
that
georgia
procedure
requires.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
true
in
a
state
that
specifically
required
by
law
payment
of
tax
under
protest
following
certain
procedures?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
you
would
ignore
the
state
law?
unknown
speaker
if
you
had
had
an
opportunity
to
file
a
statement
that
said
we
protest?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
you
had
that
opportunity?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
you
could
have
written
a
letter?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
siegel.
ms.
baker.
unknown
speaker
xxx
votes
to
the
contrary.
unknown
speaker
ms.
baker,
your
opponent
says
that
the
hostetter
decision
in
1964
was
the
watershed,
so
to
speak,
rather
than
bacchus.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
it's
a
federal
question
though?
unknown
speaker
do
we
assume
that
georgia
would
provide
a
refund
here
if
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
on
the
retroactivity
of
bacchus?
unknown
speaker
or
has
that
been
decided?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
ms.
baker,
under
your
refund
procedure
can
the
taxpayer
get
an
injunction
against...
future
collection
of
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
for
the
future.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
if
there
had
been...
i
was
just
wondering,
under
your
view
of
the
law,
if
there
had
never
been
a
bacchus
case,
that
we
just
had
all
the
other
law
out
there,
midcal
and
so
forth,
and
this
refund
action
had
been
filed,
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
looked
at
those
old
authorities
and,
well,
it's
an
awful
close
case,
but
then
decided
the
same
way
as
the
majority
did
in
bacchus.
would
the
taxpayer
have
been
entitled
to
a
refund,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
i
think
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
had
there
been
no
bacchus
case,
this
taxpayer
would
have
had
a
better
chance
to
get
a
refund
in
this
case
than
he
does
now.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this,
say
this
state
supreme
court
overruled
that
case.
it
said
we
understand
federal
law
has
progressed
to
the
point
where
this
is
a
burden
on
your
state
commerce,
and
so
forth.
you
say
that...
i
am
not
quite
clear
what
you
say.
unknown
speaker
so
are
you...
is
your
position
then
that
whenever
there
is
a
close
issue
of
constitutional
loss,
not
clearly
foreshadowed,
you
are
just
not
100
percent
sure.
but
if
a
taxpayer
thinks
there
is
an
unconstitutional
tax
being
levied
which
is
worthy
of
a
challenge,
that
taxpayer
has
no
hope
of
a
refund
but
the
best
the
taxpayer
can
get
is
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
is
that
really
a
valid
constitutional
argument?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
i
am
broke
i
shouldn't
have
to
pay
any
income
taxes?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
sort
of
fly
speck?
your
opponent
says
there
is
a
very
small
part
of
the
total
amount
in
controversy
that
was
post-bacchus.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
some--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
don't
deny
they
are
entitled
to
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
end
yet.
[laughter]
do
you
agree
that
all
of
the
taxes
that
they
are
seeking
recovery
for
were
protested?
that
the
payments
were
protested,
effectively
protested?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
siegel
said
that
at
least
at
some
point
there
was
a
protest
filed.
you
don't
acknowledge
that?
unknown
speaker
i
am
a
little
confused
by
the
various
responses.
does
georgia
have
a
statutory
or
administrative
protest
provision?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
there
is
a
reversal
here
the
state
of
georgia
is
not
then
going
to
defend,
as
it
were,
on
new
ground
in
the
state
courts
and
say
there
was
no
protest?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
restate...
is
this
what
you
are
saying
when
you
talk
about
chevron,
that
up
until
the
date
bacchus
was
decided
the
tax
was
perfectly
constitutional,
and
as
of
bacchus
it
became
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
you...
all
this
retroactive
language.
but
is
that
the
essence
of
your
position,
is
the
tax
was
fully
constitutional
until
bacchus
was
decided?
unknown
speaker
ms.
baker,
is
georgia
considering
the
adoption
of
some
protest
procedures
so
that
if
the
worst
of
all
scenarios
happens
and
this
court
decides
that
its
decisions
are
retroactive,
that
georgia
will
be
protected
against
the
unexpected
obligation
to
pay
back
money?
it
will
always
know
if
a
protest
has
been
made
that
a
certain
amount
of
money
in
the
treasury
is
subject
to
litigation.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
baker.
mr.
siegel,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
