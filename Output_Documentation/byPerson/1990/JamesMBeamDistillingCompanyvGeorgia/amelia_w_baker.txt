ms.
amelia
w.
baker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
georgia
supreme
court
properly
gave
prospective
effect
to
its
decision
invalidating
a
longstanding
state
alcoholic
beverage
tax
statute.
this
is
essentially
the
same
issue
that
this
court
addressed
in
the
ata
case
last
term.
we
submit
that
the
chevron
oil
test
used
by
the
plurality
in
ata
represents
the
appropriate
approach
for
analyzing
this
case,
and
that
under
chevron--
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
--there
are
four
votes
in
the
court
that
there
should
be
retroactive
application,
however,
justice
scalia
sided
with
the
plurality
in
giving
scheiner
prospective
application
in
ata.
although
he
did
not
use
the
analysis
of
the
plurality,
his
reasoning
allowed
him
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
plurality
in
ata
did.
we
would
submit
that
that
is
the
appropriate
approach
in
a
case
such
as
this.
in
a
case
where
you
have
a
decision
such
as
bacchus
imports,
that
establishes
a
new
principle
of
law,
we
think
it
is
appropriate
and
consistent
with
the
precedent
of
this
court
to
apply
the
chevron
oil
test,
because
it
is
intended
to
protect
the
good
faith
reliance
on
prior
law
and
to
protect
against
the
injustice
and
hardship
of
a
retroactive
application
by
permitting
courts
to
give
prospective
application
to
decisions
creating
new
principles
of
law.
it
is
particularly
important
to
protect
reliance
interest
with
state
governments,
who
must
rely
on
presumptively
valid
statutes
in
conducting
government
operations.
protecting
reliance,
good
faith
reliance
such
as
in
this
case
on
prior
law
is
essential
to
permitting
government
operations
to
go
forward
and
to
protecting
the
financial
stability
of
the
state.
under
the
chevron
oil
test,
as
the
petitioners
recognize,
there
are
three
prongs
that
must
be
met
before
a
decision
can
be
given
prospective
application.
under
the
first
prong
chevron
oil
states
that
a
decision
creates
a
new
principle
of
law
where
it
overturns
clear
past
precedent
or
decides
an
issue
of
first
impression
whose
resolution
was
not
clearly
foreseeable.
we
submit
that
bacchus
established
a
new
principle
of
law
by
overturning
clear
past
precedent
in
the
twenty-first
amendment
jurisprudence,
by
holding
contrary
to
the
holdings
of
this
court
up
until
that
time
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
empowers
a
state
to
regulate
the
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages
into
its
borders
without
limitation
by
the
commerce
clause.
as
the
dissent
pointed
out
in
bacchus,
the
majority
in
bacchus
adopted
a
totally
novel
approach
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
that
case
by
going
beyond
the
express
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
by
going
beyond
the
precedent
of
this
court
in
finding
that
for
the
first-time
state
regulation
of
alcoholic
beverages
must
implicate
some
central
purposes
underlying
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
order
to
outweigh
commerce
clause
principles.
the
central
purposes
identified
by
the
court
in
bacchus
are
not
found
in
the
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
nor
are
they
found
in
the
legislative
history
underlying
the
twenty-first
amendment.
prior
to
this
case
never
had
the
court
indicated
that
there
were
some
central
purposes
that
must
be
identified,
but
rather
beginning
in
1939
with
the
young's
market
case,
the
court
said
that
the
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
clear.
we
don't
need
to
go
beyond
the
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
empowers
a
state
to
regulate
or
prohibit
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages
without
limitation
by
the
commerce
clause,
period.
the
right
to,
according
to
the
court
in
young's
market,
the
right
to
import
free
has
been
abrogated
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
this
view
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
we
submit,
remained
unquestioned
until
bacchus.
even
in
cases
where
the
regulations
in
effect
constituted
economic
protectionism,
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
still
held
to
support
state
regulation
of
alcoholic
beverages.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
disagree
with
the
petitioner
on
that
point.
the
hostetter
case
represents
one
type
of
limitation
that
the
court
did
recognize
in
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
that
the
court
said
that
where
you...
where
the
state
attempts
to
regulate
alcoholic
beverages
that
are
not
being
transported
into
the
state
for
use
therein
as
prescribed
by
the
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
then
the
state
cannot
regulate
alcoholic
beverages.
and
in
the
idlewild
case
the
state
was
attempting
to
regulate
alcoholic
beverages
that
were
ultimately
destined
for
a
foreign
country,
and
the
court
found
that
that
regulation
did
not
fit
within
the
express
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
it
is
also
true
that
in
that
case
the
court
recognized
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
did
not
divest
congress
of
its
power
to
regulate
alcoholic
beverages.
that's
the
important
statement
that
was
made
in
idlewild,
and
the
statement
was
made
to
make
sure
that
the
states
were
aware
that
the
federal
government,
pursuant
to
the
commerce
clause,
could
continue
to
operate
and
enact
statutes
such
as
the
sherman
act
that
would
also
regulate
alcoholic
beverages.
but
nothing
in
idlewild
suggested
in
anyway
that
the
state
was
limited
in
its
ability
to
import
alcoholic
beverages
into
the
state
for
use
in
the
state.
there
is
no
limitation
on
a
direct
regulation
of
alcoholic
beverages,
which
the
state
tax
here
clearly
is.
there
are,
there
were
a
number
of
cases
between
young's
market
and
bacchus
in
which
this
court
did
recognize
some
limitations
on
the
twenty-first
amendment,
one
being
the
jurisdictional
limitation
in
idlewild.
there
were
a
number
of
other
limitations,
but
none
of
those
limitations
ever
went
to
the
state's
ability
to
regulate
the
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages.
mr.
siegel
suggests
that
the
midcal
case
was
sufficient
to
put
the
state
of
georgia
on
notice.
midcal
is
entirely
different
from
this
case,
and
the
regulations
involved
there
are
entirely
different.
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
in
instances
where
you
have
a
federal
statute
enacted
pursuant
to
the
commerce
clause,
and
you
have
a
state
statute
that
is
not
directly
regulating
alcoholic
beverages
but
is
peripheral
to
the
regulation
of
alcoholic
beve
ages,
then
in
those
cases
where
you
have
a
state
statute,
where
you
have
a
federal
statute
and
a
state
regulation
that
is
not
aimed
at
the
core
powers
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
we
will
engage
in
a
weighing
of
interests
to
see
whether
the
twenty-first
amendment
prevails.
again,
in
that
case
that
court
recognized
that
the
ability
of
a
state
to
regulate
importation
into
its
borders
was
not
limited
by
the
commerce
clause.
even
up
until
11
days
before
the
decision
in
bacchus
in
this
case
of
capital
cities
cable
v.
crisp,
also
decided
in
1984,
this
court
once
again
reiterated
that
a
state's
power
to
impose
burdens
on
interstate
commerce
in
alcoholic
beverages
is
not
limited
by
the
commerce
clause.
we
submit,
therefore,
that
from
the
time
of
young's
market
until
bacchus
there
was
absolutely
no
indication
in
the
case
law
of
this
court
to
put
georgia
on
notice
that
its
statute
was
invalid.
and
that
bacchus
clearly
constituted
a
new
principle
of
law,
and
it
was
noted
by
three
members
of
this
court
that
it
was
a
totally
novel
approach
and
it
was
unanticipated
by
any
cases,
and
it
was
inconsistent,
arguably,
with
the
express
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
additionally,
the
state
of
georgia
relied
on
its
own
highest
court,
which
in
1939
in
the
case
of
scott
v.
state
had
upheld
the
same
statute,
in
a
different,
earlier
version,
but
essentially
the
same
tax
structure
had
been
upheld
against
a
commerce
clause
challenge.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
we
agree
that
it
is
a
federal
question,
because
the
case
here
does
involve
the
constitutional
violation.
and
that
it
is
a
federal
question
as
in
ata
whether
the
bacchus
opinion
should
be
applied
retroactively
or
prospectively.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
i
don't
think
that
we
would
agree
that--
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
--that
issue
has
not
been
addressed
by
any
court
so
far
in
the
state
of
georgia.
and
that
issue,
i
think,
would
be
open
to
be
decided
on
a
remand
of
this
case,
not
inconsistent
with
the
principles
announced
in
the
mckesson
case.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
the
statute
in
georgia
does
not
provide
for
injunctive
relief.
but
contrary
to
what
mr.
siegel
said,
there
is
ample
case
law
in
the
state
of
georgia
which
says
that
injunctive
relief
is
an
appropriate
remedy
for
challenging
state
taxation.
and
although
we
did
not
cite
these
cases
in
our
brief,
i
have
a
number
of
citations
in
which
taxpayers
have
successively
challenged
the
imposition
of
taxes--
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
--in
the
instances
of
unconstitutional
statutes.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
i
think
that
that
issue
has
not
been
definitively
decided
by
the
georgia
supreme
court,
whether
the
refund
statute
in
georgia
mandates
a
refund
in
all
cases.
the
court
has
indicated
in
georgia
that
the
term
illegally
assessed
is
sort
of
a
term
of
art
that
they
can
interpret
in
appropriate
cases,
and
in
certain
cases
preceding
this
case
the
court
found
that
where
there
is
injustice
and
hardship
by
requiring
a
refund,
they
did
not
order
a
refund.
so
it
is
not
clear
what
the
court
would
have
done,
and
based
on
the
court
cases
i
can't
say
definitively
whether
they
would
have--
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
--i
don't
think
that's
true,
because
had
there
been
no
bacchus
there
still
was
a
state
supreme
court
opinion
in
georgia--
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
--i
think
that
even
if
our
court
had
overruled
and
agreed
with
bacchus,
that
there
is
still
authority
in
georgia
cases
and
there
have
been
instances
where
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
overruled
statutes,
and
yet
decided
that
because
of
the
equities
of
the
situation
they
would
not
order
a
refund.
even
if
they
weren't
using
chevron
at
that
time,
just
under
the
basic
principles
of
equitable
notions.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
i
think
that
they
do
have
a
chance
of
a
refund.
i
think
that
the
cases
in
which
the
georgia
courts
have
not
granted
refunds
are
very
limited.
i
mean
they
really
are
cases
that
meet
the
chevron
test,
even
if
at
the
time
the
georgia
courts
were
deciding
that
cases
they
didn't
call
it
chevron.
it
is
not
a
very
liberal
test,
we'll
say
well
this
seems
to
be
a
new
case
so
we're
not
going
to
give
a
refund.
i
think
that
the
georgia
courts
are
committed
to
giving
refunds
except
in
very
limited
situations
where
the
decision
would
create
substantial
financial
instability
and
injustice.
under
the
second
prong
of
chevron,
determining
whether
the
rule
at
issue
will
be
furthered
or
retarded
by
the
retroactive
application
of
the
case,
we
contend
for
the
same
reasons
in
ata
that
prospective
application
here
of
the
bacchus
opinion
is
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause,
because
during
the
period,
the
refund
period
at
issue,
the
state
statute
was
consistent
with
the
precedent
of
this
court
and
with
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
what
had
been
considered
legitimate
state
taxation
at
that
time.
and
as
the
court
noted
in
ata,
it
is
not
the
intent
of
the
commerce
clause
to
prevent
legitimate
state
taxation.
finally,
under
the
third
prong
of
chevron,
which
requires
a
weighing
of
the
equities,
we
clearly
think
that
the
equities
here
weigh
in
favor
of
prospective
application.
there
is
an
extremely
strong
reliance
interest
by
the
state
of
georgia
on
a
state
statute
that
had
been
upheld
by
its
highest
court,
that
was
consistent
with
the
precedent
of
this
court,
and
that
was
consistent
with
the
express
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
in
light
of
this
reliance
interest
and
absolute
lack
of
any
challenge
to
that
state
statute
from
1939
until
1985,
and
almost
1
year
after
the
decision
in
bacchus,
georgia
was
clearly
entitled
to
rely
on
that
statute.
it
would
also,
contrary
to
what
the
petitioner
said,
it
would
create
a
severe
financial
burden
for
the
state
of
georgia
to
have
to
pay
some
$30
million
in
tax
refunds
at
this
time.
the
state
is
in
a
tight
financial
situation
and
it
would
threaten
possible
government
programs
and
services
to
have
to
pay
back
that
kind
of
a
refund.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
i
am
not
sure
that
it
comes
to
the
level
of
perhaps
the
reliance
interest.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
i
don't
think
that
should
be
the
determining
factor
for
the
court
here
today.
i
think
that
the
important
factor
is
that
the
state
in
good
faith
relied
on
a
statute
that
was
consistent
with
case
law
of
its
own
court,
this
court,
and
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
that
it
collected
money
under
that
tax
statute
and
spent
it
in
good
faith
for
benefits
for
the
entire
citizens
of
the
state
of
georgia.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
i
don't
know
the
exact
amount.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
there
is
some
amount
that
is
post-bacchus.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
what
i
would
say
in
response
to
that
is
that
would
be
an
issue
for
remand
under
mckesson.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
and
i
would
just
like
to
end
by
saying
that--
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
--i
don't
believe
any
of
the
taxes
were
paid
under
protest,
either
actual
protest
in
that
they
wrote
protest
down
on
their
tax
whatever,
receipt,
or
in
fact
that
they
paid
the
taxes
under
protest.
because
it
is
clear,
to
me
anyway,
that
during
the
time
they
paid
these
taxes
they
had
no
idea,
no
understanding
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
georgia
statute.
in
fact
i
think
they
paid
the
taxes
voluntarily.
there
was
no
threatened
state
action
against
them
to
pay
the
taxes,
and
they
did
have
available
to
them
injunctive
relief
if
indeed
they
thought
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
tax.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
the
protest
was
filed
after
the
refund
period
was
over,
in
i
believe
march
or
april
of
1985,
subsequent
to
the
time
that
all
the
tax
had
already
been
paid,
and
subsequent
to
the
time
that
this
statute
at
issue
here
had
been
repealed.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
there
is
no
requirement
for
a
protest
in
georgia.
the
refund
statute
does
not
require
a
protest.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
no,
we
are
not.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
in
sum,
we
submit
that
the
chevron
oil
test
represents
the
appropriate
approach
for
analyzing
this
case,
and
it
is
the
appropriate
way
of
protecting
good
faith
state
reliance
on
a
statute
that
was
presumptively
valid,
and
which
the
state
had
no
reason
to
believe
would
be
invalidated.
we
believe
that
we
satisfy
each
and
every
one
of
the
three
prongs
of
chevron
oil,
and
we
also
believe
that
if
the
court
should
find
that
we
do
not
satisfy
chevron
oil
or
that
the
decision
should
be
given
a
retroactive
application
for
other
reasons,
that
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
for
determination
of
a
remedy
not
inconsistent
with
mckesson.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
basically
what
we
are
saying
is
that
based
on
the
principles
used
in
ata
that
the
court
has
the
ability
to
determine
when
and
how
it
will
apply
its
decisions,
and
that--
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
--it
was
our
position
it
was
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
with
the
case
law
of
the
court
up
until
the
decision
in
bacchus.
ms.
amelia
w.
baker
i
think
that
georgia,
along
with
many
states,
are
investigating
the
possibility
of
changing
their
statutes
to
give
them
greater
protection,
whether
it
be
limiting
the
statute
of
limitations
for
a
refund,
or

statute.
if
there
are
no
further
