justice
stevens
could
i
change
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
just
a
little?
supposing
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
actual
quote
is
much
more
insulting
and
harmful
and
defamatory,
but
yet
the...
what
is
actually
said
is
also
defamatory.
have
you
proved
malice
just
by
that,
by
the
fact
it's
inaccurate?
justice
stevens
what
if
it's
just
reversed?
what
you
said
was
i
am
a
bastard
and
he
wrote
my
mother
and
father
never
got
married?
what
do
you
do
with
that
case?
justice
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
the
hotchner
case.
what
do
you
do
with
the
case
yourself?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it
was
easy
when
we
asked
you
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
you
said
it
was
clearly...
would
create
an
inference
of
malice.
that's
exactly
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you.
justice
stevens
so
it
goes
to
the
jury,
or
does
it
not
go
to
the
jury?
justice
stevens
well,
what
if
we
thought
each
of
these
was
just
like
that?
that
the
real
facts,
if
you
read
the
whole
book,
are
even
worse
than
the
intellectual
gigolo.
justice
stevens
if
we
thought
that.
i
mean--
justice
stevens
--what
if
we
read
it
carefully
and
we
come
to
that
conclusion?
justice
stevens
well,
but
it's
a
question
of
your
theory.
it
seems
to
me
you're
giving
away
your
theory.
i
had
thought
that
the
fact
that
it
is
reported
someone
says
something
about
himself
is
indicative
of
hypocrisy,
and
it's
an
altogether
different
formulation
than
if
someone
makes
that
same
statement
as
a
third
person.
but
you
seem
to
be
giving
that
away.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
farr,
you're
giving
us
an
example
of
what
would
constitute
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
malice.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
separate
questions.
one
is
whether
every
misquote
is
competent
evidence
of
malice,
as
justice...
souter
points
out.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
a
misquote
and
they
knew
it,
that's
some
evidence.
maybe
it's
not
strong
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
or
clear
and
convincing.
but
then
the
second
case
is
whether,
is
it
strong
enough
to
constitute
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
i
think
you're
arguing
that
it's
no
evidence
at
all.
justice
stevens
well,
you
can't
say
it
means
nothing
if
it's
admissible
competent
evidence.
it's
just
not
sufficient.
i
don't
think
you
can
correctly
say
it
means
nothing.
the
very
fact
of
misquotation
means
something.
your
opponent
concedes
that
there
are
lots
of
misquotations
that
are
not
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury.
so
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
you
don't...
couldn't
really
agree
on
that
and
not
decide
this
case.
that
it
certainly
is
competent
evidence,
i
would
think,
to
show
that
the
quote
was
different
from
what
was
actually
said.
but
that's
very
different
from
the
example
of
saying
i
am
a
racist,
and
he
never
said
anything.
justice
stevens
does
it
create
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
malice
in
every
case?
justice
stevens
will
you--
justice
stevens
--but
even
in
your
80-yard
run
case
it's
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
malice?
justice
stevens
all
right,
then
you
don't
mean
what
you
said.
