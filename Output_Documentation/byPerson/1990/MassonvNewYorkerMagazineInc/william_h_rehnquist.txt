chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-1799,
jeffrey
m.
masson
against
new
yorker
magazine,
alfred
knopf,
and
janet
malcolm.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
morgan,
in
any
event,
wouldn't
any
issue
of
incremental
harm
be
a
matter
of
state
defamation
law--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--rather
than
of
first
amendment
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
good
way
to
put
it,
to
say
he
has
a
right
under
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
applies
to
the
government.
a
politician
as
opposed...
relating
to
the
new
yorker,
you're
talking
about
the
liability
there
is
based
on
state
libel
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
first
amendment
used
as
a
shield.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
he
has
no
right
as
against
the
new
yorker
magazine
under
the
first
amendment.
what
you
mean
to
say,
i
think,
is
that
the
first
amendment
should
not
prohibit
state
libel
law
from
giving
him
that
right.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
morgan.
mr.
farr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
50...
the
laws...
the
libel
laws
of
the
different
states
now?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
feel
you
can
make
that
sort
of
generalization?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
a
false
statement
by
a
reporter
in
an
article,
such
as
mr.
masson
said
this
when
he
in
fact
did
not
say
it,
is...
cannot
form
any
basis
for
inferring
malice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
may...
but
could
it
go
to
the
jury
as
evidence
of
malice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
this
falsity
of
the
gist
is
something
that
you
have
urged,
but
i
don't
know
that
our
cases
support
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
don't
have
any
question
of
california
law
before
us.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
don't
think
your
point...
your
point
of
view
makes
enough
allowance
for
the
fact
that
putting
words
in
someone's
mouth
as
having
said
it
themselves
can
hit
a
lot
harder
than
having
some
third
person
describe
what
they
think
the
person
said.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
would
show
he
didn't
know
how
to
use
the
word
"myself".
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
a...
in
the
eyes
of
a
reasonable
juror?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
eyes
of
a
reasonable
juror?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
mr.
morgan,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
morgan.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1799,
masson
against
new
yorker
magazine
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
