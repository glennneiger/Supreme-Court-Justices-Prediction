aren't
you
saying
two
things?
aren't
you
saying,
number
one,
that
a
misquotation
or
the
fact
of
misquotation,
in
and
of
itself,
is
competent
evidence
of
malice?
whether
the
question
of
malice
goes
to
the
jury
depends
on
what
else
there
is
in
addition
to
the
evidence
of
the
misquotation.
justice
souter
if
the
misquotation
in
fact,
as
you
said
a
moment
ago
to
justice
stevens,
could
not
give
rise
to
and...
could
not
be
a
predicate
for
damage,
then
in
fact
you're
really
saying
on
that
particular
misquotation
in
the
context
of
the
actual
misquote
no
reasonable
juror
could
infer
malice
from
it.
isn't
that
all
you're
saying?
justice
souter
why
don't
you
get
to
look
at
the
evidence
on
the
question
of
damage?
justice
souter
the
evidence
would
come
in
on
the
subject
of
damage.
justice
souter
may
i...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
souter
may
i
try
the
distinction?
it
seems
to
me
in
your
argument
you
have
posited
three
different
kinds
of
situations,
or
we
all
have,
i
guess.
number
one,
you
got
a
third
person
quote
and
a
misquote
attributed
to
a
third
person.
you
got
a
first
person
quote
and
a
misquote
attributed
to
the
first
person.
and
the
third
example
is
you've
got
a
third
person
quote,
or
at
least
third
person
evidence,
and
you
misattribute
that
by
means
of
a
first
person
quote.
if
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
that
when
we've
got
simply
the
misquotation
as
between
two
third
parties,
the
mere
fact
of
the
misquotation
may
be,
as
i
was
trying
to
say,
competent
evidence
of
malice,
but
it
is
not
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
as
an
abstract
matter
to
rise
to
the
level
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
malice.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
souter
right.
okay.
likewise,
you
have
been
arguing,
i
think,
that
when
there
are,
when
we're
talking
about
differences
between
two
first
person
quotes,
you're
saying,
i
think
you're
conceding
again
yes,
a
misquotation
can
be
some
evidence
of
malice,
but
it
is
not
enough
to
go
to
a
jury
because
unless
it
is
just
an
absolutely
egregious
example
that
totally
changes
the
substance
it
could
not
rise
to
the
level
of
clear
and
convincing.
justice
souter
justice
scalia's
example
is
the
third
person
quote,
or
we'll
say
just
the
non-first
person
evidence,
which
is
suddenly
placed
by
means
of
a
misquotation
into
a...
into
a
statement
in
quotes
attributed
to
the
first
person.
his
argument
was
when
that
statement,
misattributed
to
the
first
person,
is
defamatory,
isn't
that
enough
in
and
of
itself
to
constitute
sufficient
evidence
for
a
clear
and
convincing
finding?
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
souter
and
take
his
example.
i
am
a
racist,
when
he
never
said
he
was
a
racist.
isn't
that
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
in
and
of
itself
as
clear
and
convincing?
