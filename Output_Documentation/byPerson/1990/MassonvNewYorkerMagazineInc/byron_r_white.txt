justice
white
well,
whether
what...
whether
these
quotes,
whether
they
were
fabricated
or
not
and
defamatory
isn't
involved
in
this
case,
is
it?
isn't
it...
doesn't
this
case
turn
on
malice?
justice
white
i
think
a
lot
of
people
can
defame
people
and
not
be
liable
because
they
didn't
do
it
maliciously.
justice
white
what
is
the
issue
here?
is
it
whether
these...
this
is
defamatory?
are
we
supposed
to
decide
whether
what
was
said
was
defamatory?
justice
white
whether
malice
was
involved.
that's
what
the
case
turns
on.
justice
white
well,
that's
what
i
asked
you
and
you
said
no.
justice
white
--every
new...
every
new
decision
is
for
the
first
time,
and
every
new
decision
doesn't
have
any
precedent.
so
your...
but
you...
so
you
have
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
is
just
wrong.
justice
white
i
know
you
do,
but
it
won't
be
because
there
isn't
any
precedent.
justice
white
especially
if
he
weighs
315
pounds.
justice
white
mr.
farr,
you
said...
suppose
the
writer,
as
you've
just
suggested,
would
write
and
say
he
said
wine,
women,
and
song.
and
he
got
sued
for
it.
now,
the
plaintiff's
burden
of
proving
falsity
would
go
no
farther
than
proving
that
he
didn't
say
that.
justice
white
yeah.
he
says
i'm
suing
you
because
you
said
i
said
something
that
i
did
not.
i
don't
care
whether
it's
in
quotation
marks
or
not.
i
didn't
say
that,
and
i'm
going
to...
and
his
burden...
he's
suing
because
you
misrepresented
what
he
said.
and
his
burden
or
proving
falsity
will
go
only
to
proving
that
he
didn't
say
it.
justice
white
he
wouldn't
have
to
prove
the
falsity
of
the
content.
justice
white
you
mean
he
would...
he
really
wouldn't...
he
really
wouldn't,
if
he
had
that
house,
do
what
he
was...
what
the
reporter
said
he
would?
justice
white
you
think
he
would
have
to
prove
that?
but
he
is
only
suing
because
he
has...
he
has
been
misquoted.
he's
going
to
claim
that
that's--
justice
white
--exactly.
justice
white
exactly.
