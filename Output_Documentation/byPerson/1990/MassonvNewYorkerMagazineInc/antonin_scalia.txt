justice
scalia
mr.
morgan,
what
if...
what
if
i'm
in
an
interview
with
someone
and
i
make
some
statements
that
are
very
racist.
i
say
that
i
think
a
particular
ethnic
group
is
little
more
intelligent
than
dogs,
that
they
really
can't
cope
in
our
society,
something
like
that.
and
the
next
day
there
appears
in
the
paper
the
quote,
scalia
says
this
group
is
subhuman.
justice
scalia
now,
that's
an
inaccurate
quote.
justice
scalia
is
there
liability
for
that?
i
mean,
if
they
had,
if
they
had
quoted
it
accurately
it
would
have
been
just
as
defamatory.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
right.
but
i'm
not
going
to
the
question
of
malice.
i'm
accepting
your
position
that
all
you
need
for
malice
is
intentionally
altering
a
quote.
i
intentionally...
this
is
intentionally
altered.
there
is
no
doubt
i
didn't
say
that
and
the
writer
knows
i
didn't
say
that.
but
having
overcome
the
question
of
malice,
you
still
have
the
question
of
what's
defamatory.
and
it's
your
position
that
that
is
an
actual...
an
actionable
defamation
even
though
an
accurate
quote
would
have
harmed
my
reputation
just
as
much?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
you
wouldn't
get
by
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
unless,
i
take
it,
there
was
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
there
was
an
intentional
misquote.
justice
scalia
not
just
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
a
misquote,
but
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
misquote
was
intentional.
you're
not--
justice
scalia
--he
didn't...
he
didn't
say...
he
was
not
quoted
to
say
"i
am
an
intellectual
gigolo".
if
he
was
quoted
to
say
"i
am
an
intellectual
gigolo",
i
can
understand
how
that
is
defamatory.
he
was
quoted
as
saying
they
treated
me
like
an
intellectual
gigolo.
how--
justice
scalia
--but
how
is
that
defamatory?
i
guess
you
argue
that
defamation
is
not
an
issue
here?
justice
scalia
can
i
think
it's
not
defamatory
and
still
find
for
you
in
this
case?
because
i
don't
think
it's
defamatory.
justice
scalia
i
can't?
justice
scalia
oh.
justice
scalia
how
is
it
defamatory
of
me
that
somebody
else
treated
me
like
an
intellectual
gigolo?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
scalia
in
context
it
didn't
mean
i
was
like
one.
to
them
i
was
like
an
intellectual
gigolo.
that
is
how
they
treated
me.
yes,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
the
same
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
quote
is
that
eissler
and
anna
freud
thought
of
him
as
an
intellectual
gigolo,
and
he
is
reporting
that.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
sense
in
which...
the
fair
sense,
i
think,
in
which
to
read
that.
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
number
one,
whether
i
am
entitled
or
we
must
parse
that
meaning
or
whether
this
is
a
question
for
the
jury?
justice
scalia
the
reasonable
interpretation--
justice
scalia
suppose...
suppose
what
he
had
said
was
there
is
no
greater
analyst
than
i
other
than
freud,
and
she
quotes
him
as
saying
i
am
the
greatest
analyst
ever
other
than
freud?
justice
scalia
why
is
there
no
problem
with
that?
justice
scalia
it's
a
misquote,
right?
justice
scalia
and
she...
let's
say
she
intentionally
misquotes
it
because
it
takes
up
less
space
that
way.
justice
scalia
whatever.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
but
she
knows,
she
knows
it's
a
misquote.
okay?
justice
scalia
she
has
changed
the
words,
but
they
are
the
same
words?
justice
scalia
that's
nice.
she
has
misquoted
him.
justice
scalia
now,
that
has
to
go
to
the
jury,
right?
and
you
say
if
under
state
law
there
is
some
incremental
doctrine,
maybe
they
won't
recover,
but
a
court
has
to
let
that
go
to
the
jury.
justice
scalia
well
then,
why?
why
doesn't
it
go
to
the
jury?
it
is
clearly
a
misquote.
justice
scalia
um-hum.
justice
scalia
is
it
defamatory
in
isolation?
yes.
right?
is
it
a
misquote?
why
doesn't
it
go
to
the
jury
then?
justice
scalia
so
built
into
your
doctrine
then
there
is
some
comparative,
if
indeed
her
quotation
is
a
fair
summary
of
what
he
has
said
then,
it
shouldn't
go
to
the
jury.
justice
scalia
right?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
so
if
i'm
running
in
an
election
campaign
and
i...
and
my
opponent
accuses
me
of
being
a
racist
on
the
basis
of
some
substantive
positions
i
take,
and
it's
arguable.
i
mean,
it's
a
reasonable
thing
to
say
those
positions
could
be
based
upon
somebody's
being
a
racist.
it
is
perfectly
okay
and
not
actionable
if
a
reporter
who
happens
to
buy
into
that
theory
quotes
me
as
saying
yes,
i
am
a
racist?
there's
no...
there's
no
action
available
for
that?
justice
scalia
a
reasonable
person
could
think,
on
the
basis
of
my
actions
and
on
the
basis
of
my
other
statements,
that
i
am
a
racist.
and
that's
what
the
political
debate
would
be
about.
i
deny
it;
they
say
it's
true.
this
reporter
believes
it,
and
therefore
this
reporter
is
permitted
to
write
about
me,
scalia
said
"yes,
i
am
a
racist.
"
justice
scalia
it's
my
hypothetical.
what
is--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
mr.
farr,
why
should
it
be
that
way?
why
should...
why
should
an
intentional
alteration
of
my
words
be
at
my
risk?
why
shouldn't
the
rule
be
if
you
want
to...
knowingly.
you
have
to
know
that
you
are
changing
them.
if
it's
a
good-faith
mistake,
that's
something
different.
but
you
know
that
you
are
not
using
my
real
words.
why
should...
why
should
i
be
at
risk?
it
seems
to
me
you
should
be
at
risk,
if
in
fact,
if
in
fact
it
misrepresents
me,
even
if
you
don't
think
it
does.
that's
your
tough
luck.
you
should
have
quoted
me
exactly.
then
you
would
have
been
sure
not
to
be
liable.
but
if
in
fact,
though
you
think
it
doesn't
misrepresent
me,
it
does
misrepresent
me,
why
shouldn't
you
bear
that
burden?
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
if,
for
misquotation,
as
for
everything
else,
you
must
know
that
what
you
wrote
is
not
true.
justice
scalia
you
have
no...
i
mean,
i
don't
see
this
distinction
between
knowingly
misrepresenting
substance
and
knowingly
misrepresenting
words.
it
is
knowingly
misrepresenting
substance
to
say
that
i
said
something
which
you
know
i
did
not
say.
the
substance
is
did
i
say
it.
i
did
not
say
it.
justice
scalia
no,
what
makes
the
difference,
mr.
farr,
is
that
you,
as
the
writer,
you
take
yourself
out
of
the
picture.
when
i
read
a
statement
he
said
that,
and
it's
under,
it's
over
your
byline,
i
say
well,
that's
farr's
interpretation
of
it.
but
when
you
said
he
said,
quote,
then
i
say,
gee,
that's...
he
said
that.
that's
not...
farr
is
out
of
the
picture
now.
this
is
what
the
individual
said.
that
is
a
big
difference.
i
no
longer
make
allowances
for
your
erroneous
judgment.
you
are
asking
me
to
eliminate
any
possibility
of
your
erroneous
judgment.
you're
saying
this
is
what
he
said,
quote.
justice
scalia
to
put
it
differently,
if
a
reasonable
person
could
have
given
the
words
that
interpretation,
even
though
another
reasonable
person
might
not
have
given
them
that
interpretation,
putting
it
in
quotation
marks
is
okay,
right?
all
it
has
to
do
is
be
a...
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
words,
right?
and
there
would
be
no
liability
then,
so
long
as
it's
one
of
many
reasonable
interpretations,
to
put
it
in
quotes?
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
that's
what...
but
i
thought
that's
what
the
test
is.
wouldn't
you
have
to
show
that...
to
show
malice
don't
you
have
to
have
knowing
distortion?
justice
scalia
how
could
i
show
knowing
distortion
if
that
is
one
of
several
reasonable
interpretations
of
the
words?
i...
how
could
i
possibly
prove
knowing
distortion?
it's
not
the
only
interpretation,
but
it
is
one
of
several
reasonable
ones.
justice
scalia
and
it's
your
position
that
if
not,
if
the
writer
knowingly
misquoted
but
thought
that
in
the
writer's
opinion
that
was
a
fair
representation
of
what
the
person
said,
there's
no
remedy
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
is
putting
quotation
marks?
justice
scalia
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
had
absent
a
knowing...
one
knowing
lie,
namely
the
lie
that
the
person
actually
said
that.
that
is
a
lie.
what
new
york
times
said
is
if
you
did
not
have
any
knowing
lie
at
all,
you
thought
everything
you
said
was
the
truth,
then
there
cannot
be
a
remedy
under
the
first
amendment.
but
here
you
do
have
one
unquestionable
lie.
you
know
that
that
quote
was
not
uttered.
