justice
kennedy
i
suppose
the
law
has
always
recognized
that
when
it
admits
an
admission
by
a
party
but
excludes
hearsay.
i
suppose
it's
almost
the
same
principle.
justice
kennedy
well,
you
don't
like
the
term
malice
because
for
many
people
it
excludes
reckless
disregard.
so
you
like
to
talk
about
reckless
disregard.
justice
kennedy
but
it's
our
words.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
well,
in
any
event
we're
probably
getting
off
the
point.
i'm
not
sure
what
interest
is
protected
by
saying
that
there
is
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth
by
altering
the
quotation
in
a
way
that
makes
it
no
more
defamatory
than,
or
perhaps
even
less
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
than
the
original
statement.
what
are
we
protecting
there?
why--
justice
kennedy
under
your
rule,
aren't
you
going
to
create
serious
disincentives
to
use
direct
quotes
or
even
to
have
a
tape
recorder?
justice
kennedy
what
about
justice
scalia's
hypothetical?
justice
kennedy
yes,
i
am
a
racist
is
the
false
quote.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
very,
that
the
very
circumstance
that
someone
makes
an
admission
of
that
sort,
allegedly,
is
itself
a
fact
that
is
being
highly
misrepresented.
it's
false.
justice
kennedy
but
mr.
farr,
we
have
here
self
valuative
statements
or
alleged
statements,
greatest
analyst,
honorable
man,
intellectual
gigolo.
now,
these
are
quotations
of
a
markedly
different
character
if
they
are
attributed
to
one's
self.
it's
far
different
if
someone
says
i
am
a
racist
than
for
a
third
person
to
say
he
is
a
racist.
that's
far
different.
justice
kennedy
mr.
farr,
in
this
case
if
we
take
your
test
to
take
all
of
the
substance
of
what
was
actually
said
and
compare
it
to
all
of
the
substance
of
what
was
quoted,
are
the
use
of
quote...
is
the
use
of
quote
marks
one
of
the
factors
that
we
may
take
into
consideration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case,
masson
versus
new
yorker
magazine
comes
before
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
jeffrey
masson
was
a
scholar
who
turned
to
the
study
of
psychoanalysis.
he
became
project's
director
on
the
staff
of
the
sigmund
freud
archives.
disagreements
arose
and
he
was
terminated.
masson's
own
story
and
the
whole
background
of
the
dispute
were
of
sufficient
interest
to
janet
malcolm,
an
author,
that
she
wrote
an
article
about
masson
and
about
the
archives.
she
wrote
the
article
after
a
series
of
interviews
with
masson,
many
of
which
were
tape
recorded.
the
article
was
published
first
as
a
series
in
the
new
yorker
magazine,
and
then
as
a
book.
her
work
received
complimentary
reviews,
and
this
gave
little
joy
to
masson,
however,
for
the
articles
portrayed
him
in
the
most
unflattering
light.
masson
sued
malcolm,
the
new
yorker
magazine,
and
the
book
publisher
for
defamation.
malcolm's
narrative
device
consists
of
enclosing
lengthily
passages
in
quotation
marks.
according
to
masson,
a
member
of
the
key
passages
in
the
article
that
purport
to
quote
him
were
fabrications,
attributing
to
him
words
he
never
spoke.
his
position
in
the
litigation
has
been
that
malcolm's
alteration
of
the
quotations
show
the
actual
malice
that
is
necessary
for
him
to
take
his
case
to
a
jury.
he
conceives
he
is
a
public
figure
in
the
case
so
he
must
need
the
actual
malice
standard.
actual
malice
is
a
shorthand
term,
a
term
of
art
we
use,
perhaps
it
is
an
unfortunate
phrase.
it
does
not
indicate
ill
will
or
animosity.
it
means,
in
the
context
of
a
defamation
suit,
that
a
statement
is
made
with
knowledge
of
falsity
or
with
reckless
disregard
for
truth
or
falsity.
both
the
district
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
that
masson
had
not
shown
actual
malice
in
this
sense
because
the
quotations
were
irrational
interpretation
of
the
things
that
masson
had
said.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
this
case
comes
to
us
after
a
summary
judgment
was
granted,
so
we
must
assume
that
malcolm
acted
with
the
required
mental
state
and
that
the
quotations
were
in
fact
altered.
masson
must
still
prove
these
matters,
and
the
questions
whether
he
can
prevail
if
he
does
so.
in
some
sense,
any
alteration
of
a
verbatim
quotation
is
false,
but
writers
and
reporters
by
necessity
alter
what
people
say
at
the
very
least
to
eliminate
grammatical
or
syntactical
infelicities.
if
every
alteration
constituted
the
falsity
required
to
prove
actual
malice,
the
practice
of
journalism
would
require
a
radical
change,
when
inconsistent
with
our
precedents
and
first
amendment
principles.
we
reject
the
idea
that
any
alteration
beyond
correction
of
grammar
or
syntax
by
a
self-proof
falsity
in
the
sense
relevant
to
determining
actual
malice,
technical
distinctions
between
correcting
grammar
and
syntax
and
some
greater
level
of
alteration
do
not
appear
workable.
we
can
think
of
no
method
by
which
courts
or
juries
would
draw
the
line
between
these
and
other
changes
except
by
reference
to
the
meaning
a
statement
conveys
to
a
reasonable
reader.
on
the
other
hand,
we
also
reject
the
court
of
appeals'
views
of
our
cases
that
any
rational
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
statement
is
permitted
when
quotation
marks
are
used.
quotation
marks
used
in
an
orthodox
manner
indicate
to
the
reader
that
the
author
is
not
interpreting
the
speaker's
ambiguous
statement
but
is
attempting
to
convey
what
the
speaker
said.
were
we
to
assess
quotations
under
a
rational
interpretation
standard,
we
would
give
journalists
the
freedom
to
place
statements
in
their
subject's
mouths
without
fear
of
liability.
by
eliminating
any
method
of
distinguishing
between
the
statement
of
the
subject
and
the
interpretation
of
the
author,
we
would
diminish
the
trustworthiness
of
the
printed
word
and
eliminate
any
real
meaning
of
quotations.
in
order
to
prove
falsity,
we
require
that
an
altered
statement
convey
a
materially
different
meaning
to
the
reader
than
the
actual
statement.
this
is
the
sense
in
which
falsity
is
understood
in
the
common
law
of
defamation
and
the
first
amendment
actual
malice
requirement
relies
upon
this
historical
understanding.
quotation
marks
allow
the
reader
to
form
his
or
her
conclusions,
and
to
assess
the
conclusions
of
the
author
instead
of
relying
entirely
upon
the
author's
characterization
of
her
subject.
fabricating
quotation
may
injure
reputation
in
at
least
two
senses,
either
one
giving
rise
to
a
conceivable
claim
in
defamation.
first,
the
quotation
might
injure
because
it
attributes
an
untrue
factual
assertion
to
the
speaker.
an
example
would
be
a
fabricated
quotation
by
a
public
official
admitting
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
serious
crime
when
in
fact
he
had
not
been.
second,
regardless
of
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
factual
matters
asserted
within
the
quoted
statement,
the
attribution
may
result
an
injury
to
reputation
because
the
manner
of
expression
or
even
the
fact
that
the
statement
was
made
indicates
a
negative
personal
trait
or
an
attitude
the
speaker
does
not
hold.
john
lennon
was
once
quoted
as
saying
of
the
beatles
"we
are
more
popular
than
jesus
christ
now."
supposing
the
quotation
had
been
a
fabrication,
it
appears
california
law
could
permit
recovery
for
defamation
because
even
without
regard
to
the
truth
of
the
underlying
assertion,
false
attribution
of
the
statement
could
have
injured
his
reputation.
the
self-condemnatory
quotation
may
carry
more
force
than
criticism
by
another.
it
is
against
self-interest
to
admit
one's
own
criminal
liability,
arrogance,
or
lack
of
integrity
and
so
all
the
more
easy
to
credit
when
it
happens.
the
principle
underlies
the
elemental
rule
of
evidence
which
is
that
admissions
are
allowed
in
evidence
despite
their
hearsay
character.
applying
these
standards
to
the
case
before
us,
we
conclude
that
many
of
the
statements
of
which
petitioner
complains,
do
in
fact
convey
a
substantially
different
meaning
than
the
tape
recorded
statements,
and
therefore,
evidence
to
requisite
falsity.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
occasion
to
address
petitioner's
arguments
that
the
two
publishers
might
be
held
liable
either
as
malcolm's
employer
or
because
they
publish
with
knowledge
or
reckless
disregard
of
falsity,
we
decline
to
address
those
arguments
in
the
first
instance.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
