justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
morgan,
do
you
take
the
position
that
every
misquote
gives
rise
to
an
inference
of
actual
malice?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
defamatory
is
typically
defined
under
state
law,
right?
justice
o'connor
not
federal
law.
justice
o'connor
so
we're
not
concerned
with
that
here.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
injury
to
reputation
is
different
when
the
injury
occurs
by
virtue
of
a
misquote
than
when
it
occurs
by
virtue
of
a
characterization?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
you
are,
because
you're
arguing
that
every
misquote
gives
rise
to
an
inference
of
actual
malice.
and
so
the
reporter
who's
in
a
hurry,
or
whose
tape
gets
garbled
and
who
relies
on
memory
is
then
at
risk
if
the
person
quoted
says
that
isn't
exactly
what
i
said.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
the
question
is
a
little
different.
if
the
writer
entirely
fabricates
the
language,
it's
not
a
misquote,
it's
an
entire
fabrication
to
say
that
mr.
x
said
i
am
a
racist.
that
isn't
what
mr.
x
said
at
all.
justice
o'connor
and
a
quote
is
fabricated
to
that
effect,
which
under
state
law
would
be
regarded
as
defamatory.
now,
is
that
fact
of
the
fabrication
of
the
quote
something
that
raises
an
inference
of
actual
malice?
justice
o'connor
the
quote.
the
intentional
writing
of
that
quoted
language,
knowing
that
it
was
not
said.
