mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
briefly
setting
out
our
position
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
begin
with
what
i
think
is
an
obvious
point:
that
libel
law
is
not
concerned
with
misquotation
for
its
own
sake
or
with
setting
journalistic
standards.
what
libel
law
is
concerned
with
is
misrepresentations
of
substance
with
a
defamatory
gist
of
things.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
general,
that's
correct.
all
the
libel
laws.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
yes.
i
think
all
libel
laws
at
bottom
are
concerned
with
misrepresentations
of
substance.
under
the
balance
struck
by
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
and
later
cases,
the
first
amendment
gives
way
only
when
a
writer
knows
or
reasonably
suspects
or
recklessly
disregards
that
the
defamatory
gist
is
false.
that's
the
same
rule
for
all
libel
cases,
whether
they
involve
quotations
or
not,
and
that's
simply
the
point
we're
trying
to
make
here.
the
first
amendment
protects
a
writer
accused
of
misquotation
unless
the
plaintiff
can
show
that
the
writer
strongly
suspected
that
he
was
misrepresenting
the
gist
of
what
was
said.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--justice
scalia,
i
think,
as
i
say,
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
that
that
reflects
an
exaggeration
of
the
position
that
i
am
trying
to
make.
i
think,
quite
frankly,
the
same
exaggeration
that
judge
kozinski
made
below.
what...
the
point
that
i
am
making--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
let
me
explain
that
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make,
if
i
may.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
the
inquiry
is
into
whether
the
writer
is
knowingly
misrepresenting
something
that
was
said,
the
substance
of
something
that
was
said.
not
somebody's
character
in
general,
not
their
views
on
other
issues
that
they
were
not
talking
about,
but
a...
the
particular
subject
matter
that
was
talked
about
and
the
views
expressed
by
the
speaker
on
that
subject
matter.
if
there
is
no
knowing
misrepresentation,
thus
limited,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
no
more
than
there
would
be
if
there
was
a
direct
paraphrase
do
you
have
any
situation
where
the
writer
is
knowingly
misrepresenting
the
defamatory
gist
of
what
is
being
said.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
mean
to
say
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
simply
showing
that
there
may
be
knowledge
of
different
words
is
not
itself
all
you
need
to
prove
malice.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
circumstance.
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
a
reporter
accused
of
misquotation,
where
the
form
of
the
accusation
and
the
materials
about
what
was
actually
said
would
support
an
inference
of
knowing--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--if
i
understand
his
hypothetical--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
do
not
understand...
i
do
not
understand
that
there
is
something
particular
that
has
been
said
in
that
case
that
is
being
represented
by
the
reporter.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
he
has
made
an
admission,
if...
again,
maybe
i'm
not
clear
on
the
hypothetical.
what
i
am
understanding
you
to
say
is
that
somebody
is
drawing
an
inference
about
character
and
simply
inventing
a
quote
based
on
that
idea
of
character.
if
you
say
things...
for
example,
if
you
say
i
have
a
strong
prejudice
against
a
particular
racial
group,
and
someone,
and
you
are
quoted
as
saying
that
you
are
a
racist
with
regard
to
that
particular
group,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
not,
well,
does
that
settle
the
malice
inquiry
just
because
the
words
are
different
and
you
can
make
an
accusation
that
the
reporter
knew
the
words
were
different.
the
malice
inquiry
then
turns
to
the
question
is
there
sufficient
evidence
from
that
alone,
or
even
combined
with
other
evidence,
as
justice
souter
suggests,
that
the
writer
was
knowingly
misrepresenting
the
substance
of
what
you
said.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
first
of
all
i
think
that
there
are
two
parts
to
the
answer.
the
first
part,
which
is
the
sort
of
legal
analysis,
is
that
i
think
that
creates
a
separate
malice
rule
for
quotations
as
opposed
to
other
ways
of
describing
what
somebody
says,
such
as
paraphrases,
which
focuses
on
one
particular
kind
of
falsity
and
not
the
same
falsity
that
is
the
gist
of
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
question,
though,
is
what
exactly
is
the
gist
of
the
action?
what
is
the
core
of
the
action?
the
falsity
you
were
talking
about
is
simply
a
falsity
of
words.
you
cannot
win
a
libel
action,
you
cannot
bring
an
action,
you
cannot
base
an
action
for
defamation
on
simply
saying
the
words
are
different.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
falsity
you
must
show
is
something
different.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
they
do.
that
certainly
california
law,
in
order
to
bring
an
action,
and
i'm
talking
about
now
the
interest
that
they
are
pursuing--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
it
is
the
california
law
that
is
intersecting
with
the
first
amendment
in
this
case,
so
there...
that's
correct,
you
don't
have
to
decide
california
law,
but
that
is
what
the
california
law
represents.
but
if
i
could
return
to
the
second
point
i
was
going
to
make
to
justice
scalia,
what
i
suggest
you're
doing
in
saying
any
time
you
knowingly
change
words
to
the
press,
now
you
are
assuming
the
risk.
you
essentially
at
this
point
have
strict
liability
for
anything
that
you
do
if
it
turns
out
to
change
the
meaning--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
accusation
by
itself,
i
think,
does
not.
let
me
suggest
that
the
difference
between--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
it
does
not
by
itself
raise
the
inference
of
malice
as
i
believe
it
is
correctly
interpreted.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
i
mean
from
this
case.
in
his
complaint,
and
this
is
at
page
260,
this
was
the
original
complaint,
petitioner
alleged
that
he
had
been
quoted
as
saying
analysis
stands
or
falls
with
me
now.
this
is
at
page...
at
the
bottom
of
page
260.
and
he
says
in
truth
masson
never
said
such.
so
he
is
accusing
janet
malcolm
of
a
total
fabrication
with
this
quote.
now,
fortunately,
it
turned
out
that
we
had
absolute
evidence
of
this
quote
because
this
quote
was
on
the
tape,
that
he
said
exactly
these
same
words.
but
let
us
assume
for
a
minute
that
we
were
in
the
posture
we
are
with
several
of
the
quotes
that
are
still
at
issue
here,
that
all
that
we
had
was
notes
representing
the
substance
of
this
quote.
he
would
be
saying
right
now
that
he
is
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury,
simply
based
on
his
denial
of
those
words,
even
though
in
fact
we
have
undisputed
evidence
that
on
that
particular
subject
about
his
place
in
psychoanalysis
he
said
not
only
analysis
stands
or
falls
with
me
now,
but
we
also
have
evidence
that
he
said
substantially
equivalent
things.
i
suggest
that
looking
at
that
evidence,
which
we
would
not
be
able
to
look
at
under
petitioner's
rule,
negates
any
inference
that
the
writer
could
have
knowingly
been
trying
to
misrepresent
the
substance
of
his
views
on
that
particular
subject.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is...
well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
might.
but
i'm
saying
on
the
subject
of
malice,
i
believe
it
ought
to
come
in
on
the
subject
of
malice.
because
what...
the
balance
i
believe
struck
by
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
between
state
libel
law
and
the
first
amendment
is
one
that
looks
at
knowingly
misrepresenting
substance,
not
simply
knowingly
misrepresenting
words.
and
his
rule
essentially
would
take
that
case
that
i
just
used,
based
on
an
accusation
of
misquotation,
and
move
that
case
to
the
jury.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is
knowingly...
i
mean,
in
that
hypothetical
case
where
the
writer
in
fact
is
proved
to
have
known
of
the
misrepresentation
it,
arguably
i
suppose,
could
be
said
to
be
substance,
but
not
defamatory
substance.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
that
is
what
the
actual
malice
test
in
every
other
circumstance
focuses
on.
if
i
can
use
an
example
of
a
paraphrase,
let's
say
that
instead...
take
the
particular
quotes
here,
anyone
you
want.
sex,
women,
fun,
perhaps.
let's
say
that
the
sentence
read
exactly
the
same
way
it
reads
now,
except
instead
of
using...
putting
quotation
marks
around
the
word
sex,
women,
fun,
it
was
a
paraphrase
that
said
jeffrey
masson
said
that
if
he
lived
in
the
freud
house
in
london
he
would
turn
it
into
a
place
of
sex,
women,
fun.
period.
no
quotation
marks.
the
standard
for
evaluating
actual
malice
in
that
case,
with
the
paraphrase,
would
be
did
the
writer
knowingly
change
the
defamatory
substance
of
that
statement.
and
given
other
statements
on
exactly
the
same
subject,
not
things
showing
his
character
generally,
but
on
exactly
that
same
subject,
what
would
he
do
if
he
lived
at
the
freud
house
in
london,
it's
clear
there
would
be
no
misrepresentation--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
is
true,
but
perhaps
less
true
than
it
seems
at
first
blush.
i
think
that
usually
the
most
potent
effect
out
of
attributing
something
to
a
speaker
is
that
you
are
attributing
the
content
of
what
he
says
to
the
speaker,
that
he
says
something
derogatory
about
someone
else.
it's
not
normally
the
particular
choice
of
words.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
the
question,
as
i
understood
the
chief
justice
to
ask
it,
isn't
the
fact
that
words
are
attributed
to
somebody
much
more
powerful.
that
is
the
idea
of
a
quote.
i
think
there
are
two
different
circumstances
that
have
to
be
compared
and
kept
in
mind.
first
of
all,
the
words
are
attributed
to
him,
but
other
words
could
be
attributed
to
him,
let's
say
undisputedly,
that
would
have
the
same
power.
so,
for
example
let's
say,
instead
of
saying
sex,
women,
fun
with
regard
to
how
he
would
conduct
himself
at
the
freud
house,
he
was
quoted
as
saying
myself
and
another
psychoanalyst
would
pass
women
around
to
each
other
and
we
would
have
a
wonderful
time
and
we
would...
we
would
open
it
up--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
can't
lay
that
on
him.
i
think
it
shows
i
don't
know
how
to
use
it.
[laughter]
but
in
any
event,
i
think
the
power
of
the
sentence
would
be
from
the
content
of
the
sentence
in
that
particular
case,
and
the
fact
that
he
holds
those
views,
that's
what
in
fact
he
would
do
if
he
went
into
something
that
is
now
a
place
of
scholarship.
the
particular
choice
of
words
in
that
particular
situation
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
there
may
be
situations
where
a
paraphrase
would
be
different
from
a
quote,
because
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
paraphrase
it
would
put
a
filter
in
there.
and
there
may...
excuse
me--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--his...
under
the
plaintiff's
theory
here--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--his
burden--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--justice
white,
i
believe
he
would.
if
i
understand
your
question--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
he
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
both
that
he
would
not
do
that,
and
that
the
reporter
knew
that
he
would
not
do
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
sorry.
excuse
me,
i've
misunderstood.
i
don't
think
he
has
to
prove
what
his
conduct
actually
would
be
in
the
freud
house.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
sorry,
if
that's
what
you're
saying.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
what
he
would
have
to
do
if
he
sued...
let's
say
under
my...
under
the
hypothetical
i
was
using,
if
he
did
sue
and
say
this
misrepresents
what
i
said
about
what
i
would
do,
he
would
have
to
show
that
he
did
not
in
substance
say
that.
that's
what
he
would
have
to
do.
and
he
would...
his
malice
inquiry
would
turn
on
that
substance,
not
simply
on
whether
there
was
a
difference
in
the
words.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct,
and
i
don't
dispute
that.
we
are
not
suggesting,
justice
kennedy,
that
in
determining
whether
there
has
been
a
knowing
misrepresentation
of
the
substance
of
what
someone
has
said,
that
you
could
use
words
said
by
somebody
else
about
him
as
part
of
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
knowing
misrepresentation
of
substance.
what
i
am
suggesting...
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
at
least
if
i
indicated
what
i
think
the
proper
way
to
go
about
the
inquiry
is,
because
i
think
it
will
show
that
we're
not,
for
example,
talking
about
as
broad
a
theory
as
i
think
were
attributed
to
us.
the...
it
seems
to
me
that
when
someone
accuses
a
reporter
of
misquotation,
that
the
proper
malice
inquiry
is
to
look
at
the
substance
of
all
of
the
things
that
the
person
has
said,
particularly
to
that
reporter,
on
the
subject.
then
you
would
take
the
disputed
parts,
because
i'm
assuming
we're
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
the
disputed
parts
and
the
undisputed
parts,
and
make
a
comparison
between
them.
if,
based
on
that
comparison,
one
could
draw
a
conclusion
that
the
addition
of
the
disputed
words
will
carry
an
inference
that
there
is
a
knowing
change
in
the
overall
substance
of
what
he
said,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
draw
an
inference
of
actual
malice.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
don't
mean
to
be
ironical,
but
i
don't
think
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
i
said.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
you
do
have
to
have
knowing
distortion,
but
i
don't
understand
why
the
mere
rational
interpretation
test
would
necessarily
protect
you
from
that.
it
might
in
some
cases.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
mean,
i
suppose
i
guess
it
depends
on
the
other
issues.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basic
test,
as
i
say,
is
whether
there
is
a,
sufficient
evidence
of
a
knowing
misrepresentation
of
substance.
i
think
that's
what
the
proper
inquiry
should
be.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct,
if
we're
talking
about
the
summary
judgment
stage,
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
again,
if
i
understand
the
question,
i
think
it
would
be.
i
would
think...
let
me
take
an
example
so
that
at
least
what
i
am
thinking
of
may
become
clearer.
if...
there
are
cases,
i
believe,
where
a
choice
of
words
would
be
so
out
of
character
for
the
plaintiff
or
would
reflect
so
differently
on
his
character
than
the
content
of
what
was
being
said,
that
there
may
be
an
additional
defamatory
gist
out
of
that
word,
that
choice
of
word
itself,
the
type
of
sort
of
trivial
example,
i
guess,
that
occurs
to
me
is
a
parson
swearing.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
justice
stevens,
i
don't
mean
that
to
be
the
argument.
what...
perhaps
i
can
be
clearer
by
saying
i
agree
with
both
parts
of
what
you
say.
what
i
am
emphasizing,
i
suppose,
with
regard
to
the
first
part
is
that
it
is
important,
i
think,
to
understand
what
the
inquiry
is,
what
it
is
that
we
are
looking
at
the
words
for.
and
that
is
all
i'm
saying.
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
looking
at
the
words
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
knowing
misrepresentation
of
what
i
keep
calling
the
gist.
the
fact
that
there
is
a
difference
in
words
by
itself,
if
you
don't
connect
it
to
that
other
inquiry,
i
think
means
nothing.
i
think
once
you
connect
it
to
that
other
inquiry,
then
i
think
it
is
relevant.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
all
right.
perhaps
i
stand
corrected.
i
think
i
see
a
distinction
there,
but
i
don't
feel
that
i
need
to
defend
that
distinction
to
answer
the
point
you're
making.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
of
course,
justice.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
depending
perhaps
on
the
amount
of
difference,
but
generally
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
um,
i
guess
i'm
not--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
may
be
having
more
difficulty
than
i
should
in
keeping
the
categories
apart.
at
least
what
i'm
thinking
of
as
i
understand
that,
justice
scalia's
quotation...
i
mean
hypothetical...
is
more
the
second
situation.
i
mean,
at
least
that's
what
i
think
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case,
is
the
situation
of
first
person
quotations.
i
don't
see
in
this
case
a
situation
where
the
person
being
quoted
has
not
addressed
the
subject
of
any
of
the
quotes
we're
talking
about
here.
he
clearly
discussed
what
he
would
do
at
the
freud
house.
he
clearly
discussed
how
anna
freud
and
dr.
eissler
viewed
him.
he
clearly
discussed
the
other
things
that
are
being
presented.
so
it
does
not
seem
to
me
here
that
you
have
a
situation
where
you
are
reaching
out
to
something
and
saying
i
am
going
to
bring
in
substance
from
somewhere
else
and
attribute
it
to
this
person.
what
it
seems
to
me
this
case
involves
is
the
case
where
the
reporter
says
i
am
dealing
with
the
views
of
jeffrey
masson
on
this
subject,
here
is
what
i
represent
him
as
having
said.
jeffrey
masson,
like
many
plaintiffs,
claims
he
was
misquoted.
and
i
believe
the
right
inquiry
is,
on
the
actual
malice
standard
in
that
case,
is
there
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
by
representing
what
he
said
on
this
subject
or
these
subjects
the
writer
was
knowingly
trying
to
misrepresent
what
he
in
fact
said.
and
all
i
am
saying
is
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
libel
law
does
not
provide
that
remedy,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
that
is
the
balance
struck
in
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
between
knowing
misrepresentation
of
substance
and
the
law
of
libel
of
the
various
states.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
let
me
back
up
a
step.
but
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
also
said,
of
course,
that
threat
of
sanctions
in
many
cases
is
almost
as
chilling
as
the
sanctions
themselves.
here
you
have
the
threat
of
that
coming
out
of
any
accusation
of
misquotation,
the
issue
of
whether
it's
deliberate
or
not
simply
is
part
of
the
accusation.
