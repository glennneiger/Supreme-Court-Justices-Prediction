mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
action
by
jeffrey
masson
in
which
he
has
claimed
he
has
been
defamed
by
publishing
of
defamatory
quotations
purportedly
said
by
him,
but
never
said
by
him.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeal
assumed
that
the
fact
that
the
quotations
were
fabricated.
i
am
assuming
that
this
court
will
accept
the
same
assumption,
however,
i
am
prepared
to
discuss
the
various
factors
that
we
introduced
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
words
were
not
on
the
tape.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
making
its
decision,
stated,
one,
that
a
fabricated
quote
that
is
wholly
fabricated
creates
an
inference
of
actual
malice.
but
it
went
on
to
say
then
that
fictionalized
quotes
will
not
create
an
inference
of
malice
if
the
fictionalized
quote
is
a
rational
interpretation
of
what
the
speaker
said,
or
if
it
does
not
alter
the
substantive
content
of
what
the
speaker
said.
then
they
went
a
step
further
and
they
said,
as
an
example
of
the
latter,
that
a
fictionalized
quote
created
no
inference
of
malice
because
it
was
consistent
with
the
speaker's
lifestyle
and
his
idea
of
fun.
it
went
further
and
said
that
it
came
within
the
same
concept
and
did
not
create
an
inference
of
actual
malice
if
it
was
substantially
the
same
as
his
own
self-appraisal
of
himself.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
take
the
position
that
every
misquote
that
is
defamatory
and
is
not
just
a
very
minor
misquote--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
so
what
we
deal
with
here...
and
california
is
interesting,
because
in
california
if
a
statement
exposes
a
person...
that's
all
it
is,
it
doesn't
have
to
say
that
he
does
it
or
he
is
it,
or
whatever,
it
merely
says
if
it
exposes
him
to
contempt,
ridicule,
obloquy,
or
if
it
has
a
tendency
to
harm
him
in
his
profession.
and
so
therefore
any
statement
of
that
form
that
is
not
what
the
speaker
said,
in
our
opinion
creates
an
inference
of
actual
malice.
and
i'm
not
basing
that
on
whole
cloth.
we
are
basing
that
on
this
court's
statement
in
st.
amant
v.
thompson
when
this
court
said
that
professions
of
good
faith
will
be
unlikely
to
prove
persuasive,
for
example,
where
a
story
is
fabricated
by
the
defendant
or
is
the
product
of
his
imagination.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
all
of
the
amici
briefs
and
their
documents
they
put
in
point
out
to
you
that
the
impact
when
it's
coming
from
the
individual,
as
opposed
to
coming
from
the
writer's
perception
of
the
individual,
has
a
greater
impact.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
so
obviously
it
has
a
far
greater
impact.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
we
start
with
this.
the
person
that
made
that
statement,
of
course,
he
also
has
the
right
of
the
freedom
of
speech
and
the
public
has
the
right
to
hear
exactly
what
he
said.
now,
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
substituting
your
conclusion
for
what
he
said,
and
yet
the
very
words
may
not
necessarily
be
the
same.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
i
devine
what
i
think
you're
saying,
and
what
i
think
you're
posing,
you're
really
dealing
with
the
concept
of
incremental
harm.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
because
you
use
the
term
defamatory.
the
minute
you
say
something
that
will
subject
me
or
expose
me
to
obloquy--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--it's
defamatory.
but
now
the
next
question
is
am
i
harmed
by
it?
am
i
damaged
by
it
because
i
said
something
that
at
least
in
your
perception
is
similar
to
what
they
are
writing?
if
i
understand
the
concept,
and
my
own
feeling
is
that
there
isn't
such
a
concept
as
incremental
harm
and
we
really
haven't
seen
it
anywhere
yet,
nevertheless
i
am
still
entitled
to
have
a
trier
of
fact
decide
whether
this
particular
one,
this
statement,
is
any
different
than
this
statement.
as
long
as
i
have
met
all
the
rest
of
the
requirements,
then
it
seems
that
the
trier
of
fact
makes
the
decision
well,
there's
no
harm
because
he
said
exactly
the
same
thing.
that's
not
this
case
though,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
important
to
point
out.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
believe
so.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
absolutely.
i
don't
think
it's
an
issue
here.
i
don't
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
right
in
even
raising
it
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
have
i
proved
malice?
yes,
because...
and
i
know
we're
talking
about
the
hotchner
case,
and
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
equate
that
case
here.
but
have
i
proved
malice?
yes.
i
have
proved
you
fabricated
a
quote.
i
proved
it
was
defamatory.
now
the
only
question
is
am
i
entitled
to
any
damages.
who
knows?
maybe
i'm
only
entitled
to
$1
damages,
but
maybe
i'm
entitled
to
x
dollars
punitive
damages
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
writer
brought
about
this
situation.
who
knows
on
that?
at
least
that's
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
decide.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
but
malice
requires
defamation,
your
honor.
i
mean,
in
other
words--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--well,
but
maliciously
is
the
wrong
word,
and
i
say
this
most
respectfully
to
this
court,
from
a
man
who
has
tried
a
number
of--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
the
issue
is
did
we
prove
enough
in
the
district
court
that
the
articles
were
written
either
knowing
they
were
false
or
with
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth
or
falsity.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
then
i
misunderstood
you,
and
my
apologies,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
your
honor,
all
i
can
tell
you,
and
i
have
seen
it
occasionally
from
the
courts,
say
that
it
was
a
poor
choice
of
words,
and
i
say
this
most
respectfully,
it's
an
abomination.
because
i've
had
situations--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--but
it's
a
bad
word,
and
it's
time
to
change
it.
because
i've
had
jurors
say
to
me
afterwards,
well,
i
didn't
see
any
malice--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--well,
two
things.
first,
you
know,
the
concern
i
have
here
is
these
words
weren't
as
defamatory
or
the...
as
what
he
said.
they're
not
equivalent.
and
i'll
take
a
moment
to
show
you
one.
but
the
answer
is
what
interests
are
we
protecting?
we're
protecting
the
right
of
the
speaker.
and
as
you
have
said
before,
and
it's
virginia
power
or
something
like
that
that
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
that
the
first
amendment
protects
the
communication,
the
speaker,
and
the
public.
and
certainly
when
we're
dealing
with
quotations,
and
we're
now
talking
about
public
figures
and
public
officials,
that
certainly
he
has
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
expect
that
he
will
not
have
a
fabricated
defamatory
quote.
and
that's
our
position.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
except
that
we
are
confronted
with
the
first
amendment--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--that's
right,
because
he's
a
public
figure.
and
so
therefore,
as
at
least
he
is
labeled
as
a
public
figure,
and
so
therefore
he
has
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
be
quoted
as
he
spoke.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
will
accept
that,
your
honor.
[laughter]
let
me
now--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--no.
no,
your
honor.
direct
quotes
have
been
going
on
as
long
as
we
know
they've
been
going
on,
and
if
you
read
all
the
material,
they
all
tell
you
exactly
the
same
thing.
quote
what
was
said
exactly,
and
if
you
can't,
then
don't
quote
that,
paraphrase
it.
quote
the
part
that
you
are
satisfied
with.
now
please
keep
in
mind,
your
honor,
we're
not
talking
about
the
mistake.
we're
not
talking
about
the
poor
reporter
who
has
to
get
a
quote
in
a
hurry
and
then
is
putting
it
into
the
hot
news.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--at
risk,
but
not
liable.
certainly
anytime
anybody
writes...
because
again
we
have
still
got
the
reputation
to
consider.
this
is
the
other
side
of
this
tension.
and
every
time
a
reporter
writes
something
that
is
defamatory,
certainly
there
has
got
to
be
some
at
risk
so
that
the
reputation
is
protected.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
if
the
reporter
said
look,
i
did
it
in
a
hurry,
i
thought
what
i
had
was
right,
and
i
have
no
other
evidence,
i
lose.
and
the
chances
are
i
won't
bring
the
lawsuit.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
talk
about
is
a
couple
of
the
quotes
so
i
can
dispel
any
concept
that
they
are
the
same.
and
i
want
to
start
first
with
intellectual
gigolo.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
now,
these...
what
the
writer
did
was
take
two
different
conversations,
and
if
you
look
in
the
appendix
you
will
see
that
one
conversation
is
tape
7,
and
one
conversation
is
tape
12.
in
tape
7
he
talks
about
his
affair
with
a
graduate
student,
and
what
he
says
is
that
you're
great...
she
tells
him
you're
great
in
the
bedroom,
but
you're
a
total
embarrassment
outside.
now
that
doesn't
fit
any
definition
of
intellectual
gigolo,
nor
of
any
gigolo.
all
it
shows
is
a
young
college
kid
who
is
a
total
embarrassment
outside
of
his
bedroom.
then
sometime
later
there's
another
conversation
in
which
mr.
masson
is
talking
about
trying
to
get
patients
as
a
psychoanalyst,
and
he
is
complaining
that,
well,
nobody
will
help
him.
nobody
will
get
patients
for
him.
and
he
says
i
was
a
private
asset
and
a
public
liability
because
in
their
room
they
enjoyed
talking
to
me,
but
because
i
was
so
junior
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
outside
the
room.
that's
not
a
gigolo,
and
it's
not
an
intellectual
gigolo.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
but
it
was
his
words,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--of
course
not,
of
course
not.
no.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
has
to
be
defamatory.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
otherwise
there
is
no
basis
for
a
lawsuit.
but
the
point
is--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--but
it's
you
who
in
this
fabricated
quote
is
saying,
"i
was
like
an
intellectual
gigolo.
"
and
it
never
occurred.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
a
question
for
the
jury.
and
in
california,
as
you
know--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--well,
as
your
honor
knows,
if
there
are
two
reasonable
interpretations,
one
defamatory
and
the
other
not
defamatory,
the
court
will
assume
it's
defamatory.
so
we
are
certainly
entitled
to
that.
but
i
go
the
step
further
that
even
the
fact
of
mr.
masson
purportedly
saying,
two
of
the
highest
people
in
the...
psychoanalytic
world
regarded
me
as
an
intellectual
gigolo,
is
defamatory,
because
it
is
going
to
expose
him
to
ridicule,
humiliation,
and
obloquy,
and
it
will
certainly
tend
to
harm
him
in
his
business.
i'd
like
to
take
two
more,
just
if
i
could,
and
quickly.
the
one
about
i
put
it
on
at
the
end,
or
i
tacked
it
on
at
the
end.
the
only
point
i
want
to
bring
out
about
that
one
is
the
point...
the
question
that
supposedly
he
side-stepped
and
didn't
answer,
was
never
asked
of
him.
and
ms.
malcolm
concedes
that.
she
said
no,
i
never
really
did
ask
him.
that
was
just
my
state
of
mind.
and
yet
she
fabricates
a
whole
conversation.
and
yet
the
court
says
well,
there
has
been
no
alteration
of
the
substantive
content.
it
was
a
total
fabrication.
now
this
is
when
we
get
back
to
the
carson
case,
where
in
the
carson
case
they
talk
about
that
the
writer
invented
this
whole
discussion
between
mr.
carson
and
the
nbc
officials.
this
is
really
no
different.
she
invented
a
conversation
that
never
took
place.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
the
rule
is
that
it
has
to
be
wholly
fabricated,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
really
supports
a
wholly
fabricated.
what
is
the
difference
whether
you
fabricate
one
line
of
questioning
based
upon
a
conversation
or
based
upon
something
you
read
in
a
magazine
or
a
newspaper,
as
in
carson?
then
i
would
all--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--i
do.
i've
said
that.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
this
is
one
time
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
also
talk
about
the
greatest
analyst
who
ever
lived,
and
again,
the
ninth
circuit
says
this
is
supported
because
he
made
other
boastful
statements.
he
never
said,
and
you
can
go
through
all
the
tapes
there,
he
never
once
said
that
the
analyst
will
ever
think
he
is
great.
in
fact
he
said
just
the
opposite.
and
she
knew
all
of
this,
and
yet
she
fabricated
this
quote.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
says,
well,
that's
okay,
because
after
all,
at
another
point
he
said
analysis
is
going
to
stand
or
fall
with
me.
but
he
points
out
it's
not
me,
it's
the
letters
i
found,
the
letters
that
question
what
dr.
freud
had
said
or
done.
that's
the
type
of
statements
he
made,
and
he
said...
there's
no
question
he
thought
his
book
was
going
to
do
well.
he
thought
his
book
was
going
to
be
harmful
to
the
profession.
but
he
said
not
one
analyst
will
stand
up
and
speak
for
me.
and
yet
the
quote
says
they'll
say
i'm
the
greatest
analyst
after
freud,
i'm
the
greatest
analyst
that
ever
lived.
and
yet
not
one
thing
to
support
it,
but
the
ninth
circuit
says,
well,
he
had
boasted
on
other
occasions.
i
think
the
court
can
see
the
great
harm
that
can
befall
that.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
i
think
there's
no
problem
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
because
all
that
has
happened--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--of
course
it's
a
misquote.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it'll
take
up
less
space--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--but
all
that
has
happened
is--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--that's
right.
but
all
that's
happened
is
she
has
changed
the
words,
but
they
are
the
same
words.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
she
has
moved
the
sequence
of
them.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
there's
no
question
she
has
misquoted
him.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
and
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
as
we
put
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
it's
the
same
thing.
supposing
he
had
said
i
am
the
greatest
analyst,
and
she
wrote
he
said
i
am
the
greatest
therapist.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they're
basically
the
same
thing.
no
change.
as
i
understood
the
question
you
posed
to
me--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--because
the
words
are
the
same,
except
for
the
one
change.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
but
it's
not--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--it's
not
because
of
incremental
damage
or
incremental
harm.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
because
of
the
substantial
truth
doctrine.
now,
you
see,
we
take
the
position
that
a
quote
is
no
different
than
a
statement
of
fact.
let
me
give
you
an
example,
and
forgive
me
for
being
from
california
and
doing
this.
but
i
can
say
that
the
reporter
says
i
saw
nose
tackle
carter
run
60
yards
for
a
touchdown.
or...
and
then
it
quotes
nose
tackle
carter
as
saying
well,
i
lumbered
for
61
yards
for
a
touchdown.
that's
a
substantial
truth.
there's
nothing
really
changed
there.
that's
so
different.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
[laughter]
that's
why
i
couldn't
resist
it,
your
honor.
there's
no
difference.
but
then...
let
me
give
you
one
that
was
in
the
amicus
brief
that
i
think
is
important.
i
make
the
statement
my
mother
and
father
never
got
married.
you
write
that
i
make
the
statement
i
am
a
bastard.
now
there's,
there's
the
difference.
and--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--well,
that's
the
hotchner
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
really
don't
think
that
you
can
show
any
damage
there.
and
i'm
hard
pressed
with
that
one,
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
the
inference
is
still
there.
i'm
not
going
to
win
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
have
a
feeling
in
that
one
that
the
court
would
grant
summary
judgment,
and
i
don't
think
any
appellate
court
would--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--your
honor,
if--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--i
understand.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
you
thought
that
the
two
statements
i
related
were
equivalent
to
mr.
masson
saying
i'm
an
intellectual
gigolo,
i'll
pack
my
bags
and
leave
now,
you
know,
because--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--well,
if
i
am,
i'm
getting
weary
then,
because
i
don't
intend
to
give
that
away.
but
certainly
in
that
situation
that
justice
stevens
propounded,
i
have
difficulty
with
ultimately
winning
it,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
i
still
say
we're
entitled
to
the
inference
of
malice.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
i
want
to
sit
down
now,
because
i
want
to
save
a
few
minutes.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
all
i
need
is
a
minute,
your
honor.
following
up
on
that
subject,
the
knowing
lie
creates
the
inference
of
malice.
the
question
of
the
substance--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
go
through
that
because
i
haven't
got
that
much
time.
but
what
i
wanted
to
add
was
the
next
step
is
the
element
of
damage.
the
substance
argument
comes
only
into
the
element
of
damage.
now
again,
the
knowing
lie
that's
defamatory--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--no,
that's
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
right.
thank
you,
your
honor.
