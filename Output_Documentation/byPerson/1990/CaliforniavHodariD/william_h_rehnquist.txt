chief

mr.

is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
factually
why
this
particular
respondent
threw
the...
the
block
or
brick
away
at
the
time
he
did?
chief

so
it's
just
really
speculation

guessing
from

that

when
you
say
bearing

running
towards
one
another,
weren't

and
hodari
had
looked
over
his
shoulder,
and
then
he
turned,
and
11
feet
away
he
saw
pertoso?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
we
determine
when
it
terminated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
certain
number
of
feet,
or
something
like
