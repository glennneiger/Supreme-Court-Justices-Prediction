justice
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
whether
he
was
a
purchaser
or
a
seller?
justice
marshall
so
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
might
have
been
the
purchaser?
justice
marshall
did
i
understand
you
to
say
the
procedure
was
taking
place?
did
you
say
the...
the
arrest
was
taking
place
when
he
was
running?
justice
marshall
well,
what
was
going
on
during
the
running?
justice
marshall
did
he
tell
him
he
was
an
officer
of
the
law?
justice
marshall
well,
how
did
the
man
know
it?
justice
marshall
and
while
the
man
was
running
he
could
look
back
and
see
the
jacket?
justice
marshall
he's
got
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head?
justice
marshall
but
i
thought--
--why
do
you
need
all
of
this
bending
of
language?
the
fact
that
he
saw
him
throw
away
a
bag
that
had
cocaine
in
it,
now
what
more
is
necessary
for
conviction?
justice
marshall
well,
why
do
you
have
to
find
out
whether
he
was
under
arrest
before
then?
justice
marshall
i
think
you
just
want
to
confuse
us,
that's
all.
mr.
sloan,
i
thought
the
police
vehicle
was
unmarked.
