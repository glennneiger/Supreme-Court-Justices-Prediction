justice
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
have...
you
certainly
are
going
to
defend...
you're
certainly
going
to
say
that
the
officer
properly
seized
him
when
he
finally
did--
justice
white
--physically,
and
the
reason
is,
i
suppose,
that
he
had
thrown
the
rock
away.
justice
white
that
gave...
that
gave
some
sort
of
reasonable
suspicion
to
do
something
about
it,
or
what?
probable
cause?
justice
white
because
otherwise
the
case
is
over,
if
you
had
no
legal
basis
to
actually
seize
him
physically.
justice
white
so
you
think
it...
you
think
the
issue
is
whether
there
was
a
seizure
prior
to
throwing
the
rock
away?
justice
white
so
that
they
just
run
into
each
other
did
they?
[laughter]
or
did
they
skid
to
a
stop?
justice
white
it
must
be
a
misprint.
[laughter]
i
mean,
i'd
like
to
see
that.
that's
quite
an
accomplishment
to
do
that
within
11
feet
while
they're
both
running.
of
course
in
your
view
what
hodari
should
have
done
was
to
declared
victory
at
that
very
moment,
because
he
says,
number
one,
i
could
continue
running
and
if
i
get
away
you
won't
catch
me,
or,
number
two,
i
can
elect
to
give
you
this
rock
and
you
can't
do
anything
with
it
anyway.
i
am
home
free
at
this
point.
justice
white
well,
that's
what
he's
claiming.
justice
white
so
you're
arguing
for
this
position
that
justice
kennedy
just
stated
right
now.
justice
white
you
don't
necessarily
win
if
we
don't
abandon
the
chesternut
rule.
justice
white
i
know
you
think
you
do,
but--
