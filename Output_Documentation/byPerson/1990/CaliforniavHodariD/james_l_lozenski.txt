mr.
james
l.
lozenski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
is
how
far
the
police
can
go
in
engaging
in
intimidating
and
coercive
conduct
before
the
fourth
amendment
rights
are
implicated.
first,
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
facts
of
this
case
somewhat.
you
had
four
young
men
standing
around
a
car
at
10
o'clock
at
night.
an
unmarked
police
car
pulls
up
to
the
curb,
getting
ready
to
turn
the
corner.
these
young
men
apparently
see
this
police...
or
this
unmarked
car.
they
take
off
and
flee.
instantaneous
with
their
flight,
the
police
officers
engage
in
a
pincer
maneuver.
the
purpose
of
the
pincer
maneuver
was
to
cut
them
off,
stop
them,
find
out
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing.
office
pertoso
says
i
didn't
follow
them.
i
ran
in
a
different
direction
while
the
other
officer
went
around
the
block.
and
the
state
says
there
is
no
show
of
authority
here
in
this
11-foot
scenario
where
officer
pertoso
confronts
hodari.
hodari
is
running
along
looking
over
his
shoulder.
he
turns
around
and
he
sees
officer
pertoso
bearing
down
on
him.
officer
pertoso
is--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--the
record
does
not
reflect
what
hodari
knew,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
no.
mr.
chief
justice,
officer
pertoso...
and
both
officers
have
testified
that
they
were
dressed
in
the
standard
task
force
uniform,
that
is
a
blue
jacket
with
police
written
on
the
front,
with
police
written
on
the
back,
blue
jeans,
tennis
shoes,
and
gun
belts.
so
i
think,
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
hodari
saw
this
officer
bearing
down
on
him,
he
knew
it
was
a
police
officer.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
officer
pertoso
was
running
directly
at
hodari,
blocking
his
path.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
bearing
right
down
on
him,
blocking
his
path,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
justice
o'connor,
in
the
manner
in
which
officer
pertoso
was
bearing
down
on
hodari,
yes,
i
do.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
my
recollection--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--my
recollection
of
the
record,
your
honor,
is
officer
pertoso
says
he
was
running
directly
at
hodari.
he
wasn't
running
to
the
right
or
to
the
left,
but
he
was
running
directly
at
hodari.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
justice
o'connor,
i
do
not
believe
that
constitutes
a
seizure,
because
i
think
what's
required
here
is
intimidating
and
coercive
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer.
whether
it's--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--yes.
but
i
think
the
officer
said...
the
officer
testified
that
our
intent
was
to
stop
them.
and
i
think
this
officer's--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--justice
o'connor,
i
believe
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
in
this
11-foot
scenario
here,
where
the
officer
is
bearing
down
on
him,
that
was
a
sufficient
blocking
of
his
path
to
constitute
a
seizure.
in
the...
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
gave
me,
i
don't
believe
that
at
that
point...
if
you
just
have
an
officer
running
in
the
general
direction
of
someone,
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
a
seizure.
but
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
yes.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
well,
if
the--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--if
he
escapes
from
the
officer--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--then
the
seizure
would
end
at
that
point,
when
he--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--when
he
manages--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--to
get
away
from
the
police
officer.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
well,
i
think
in
this
case
the
officer
would
have
of
tackled...
would
have
tackled
hodari
if
hodari
hadn't
submitted
to
his
authority.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
he...
justice
scalia,
officer
pertoso
testified
that
hodari
continued
right
towards
him.
officer
pertoso
did
not
say
he
went
to
the
left
or
he
went
to
the
right.
officer--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--i
think
they
probably
skidded
to
a
stop,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
yes.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
yes.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
correct
analysis.
i
think
that
hodari
knew
that--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--no.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
whatever
hodari
did
was
a
direct
consequence
of
that
officer
bearing
down
on
him.
if
that
officer
wouldn't
have
been
there
blocking
his
path--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--well,
maybe
if
justice
kennedy
would
ask
his
question
again,
or
propose
his
hypothetical...
there's
another
element
here.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
well,
i
don't
think
either
one
of
those
is
the
case.
i
think
hodari
panicked.
and
i
think,
as
a
lot
of
these
cases
indicate,
that
when
officers
bear
down
with
this
show
of
authority
like
this,
they
will
panic
and
discard
the
contraband.
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
i
don't
think
hodari
gave
thought
to
anything,
because
this
all
happened
so
fast
in
this
11-foot
scenario.
and
i
think
he
panicked
and
abandoned
the
contraband,
without
any
reflection
on
his
part.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
no,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
case
at
all.
no,
i
don't
take
that
position,
your
honor.
i
think
that
here
in
this
11-foot
scenario
when
the
officer
was
bearing
down
on
him
there
was
a
seizure.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
well,
there
may
be
a
seizure,
but
if
the
person
keeps
running
then
the
seizure
stops.
but
initially
there
is
a
seizure.
hodari
here
was
effectively
stopped
when
the
officer
confronted
him.
the
court
of
appeal
also
said
that
even
though
officer
pertoso
didn't
have
physical
control
of
him,
the
officer's
conduct
of
blocking
his
path
was
tantamount
to
a
physical
restraint.
so
i
don't
think
that
a
physical...
that
a
physical
acquisition
of
hodari
was
necessary.
the
blocking
of
his
path
was
tantamount
to
a
physical
restraint.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
if,
from
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
if
you
apply
the
reasonable
person
test,
if
a
reasonable
person
would
feel,
in
that
person's...
in
the
person
who
goes
around
the
roadblock's
position,
would...
if
a
reasonable
person
would
view
that
as
a--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--no,
i
don't
believe
attempted
seizure
is
a
seizure.
i
think
that
in
this
case
there
is
either
a
detention
or
there
is
not.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
no,
i
believe
that
there
can
be
a
seizure
without
an
actual
stopping
of
the
person.
the
seizure
may
terminate
as
long
as
the
person...
but,
if
the
person
gets
going
again.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
well,
if
he
escapes
from
the
police
officer
he
is
no
longer
seized,
your
honor.
but
if
the
police
officer
is
chasing
him
and
there
is
a
sufficient
show
of
authority,
some
imitating
and...
some
intimidating
course
of
conduct,
yes,
i
believe
that
that
person
has
been
seized.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
yes.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
yes.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
yes.
if
he
gets
away
from
the
officer
i
believe
that
the
seizure
terminates.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
when
he
gets
away
from
the
officer.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
when
the
officer
lose
sights...
mr.
chief
justice,
when
the
officer
lose
sight...
loses
sight
of
him.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
yes.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
hodari
was
looking
over
his
shoulder.
he
turned
around
and
saw
the
officer
bearing
down
on
him.
during
the
suppression
hearing
this,
this
distance
element
came
up
and
the
trial
judge
said
well,
that's
11
feet.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
and
the
judge--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--well,
i
think
when
hodari
turned
around
and
saw
the
officer,
the
abandonment
of
the
contraband
was
simultaneous
with
the
sighting
of
the
officer.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
this
court
has
held
that,
in
terry
v.
ohio,
that
a
police
officer
may
not
restrain
the
freedom
of
a
citizen
unless
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
doing
so.
and
in
justifying
the
intrusion,
the
police
officers
must
point
to
specific
and
articulable
facts
to
justify
the
intrusion
on
one's
freedom
of
movement.
and
as
i
have
stated
earlier
here,
these
officers
could
point
to
no
justifiable
and
articulable
facts
to
terminate
or
to
chase
after
and
then
confront
hodari.
post-terry
cases
such
as
united
states
v.
mendenhall
have
said
that
a
detention
occurs
if
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
a
reasonable
person
would
not
feel
free
to
leave.
and
in
this
11-foot
scenario
it
is
clear
that
a
reasonable
person
would
not
have
felt
free
to
leave.
the
state
here
contends
that
the
mendenhall
test
that
was
also
enunciated
in
chesternut
is
not
the
complete
test
now,
and
want
this
court
to
hold
that
as
long
as
a
person
is
fleeing
there
is
no...
there
is
no
detention
until
he
is
physically
controlled.
the
state
urges
this
court
to
adopt
a
bright
line
rule,
however,
we
feel
that
under
the
state's...
under
the
state's
proposed
rule
that
coercive
police
action
that
is
sufficiently
intimidating
that
a
reasonable
person
would
not
free
to
leave
should
not
be
subject
to
the
actual
physical
restraint
rule.
if
this
court
adopts
the
physical
restraint
rule
as
urged
by
the...
by
the
state,
many
of
these
cases
would
be
freed
from
the
strictures
of
terry
and
its
progeny.
and
moreover,
the
focus...
the
focus
would
then...
if
the
court
adopts
this
bright
line
rule,
the
focus
would
then
be
on
the
subjective
reactions
of
the
individual
to
the
police
action
rather
than
an
objective
review
of
the
police
conduct.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
the
show
of
authority,
a
submission
to
the
show
of
authority
is
fine,
your
honor.
what
we
object
to
is
establishing
a
bright
line
rule
that
says
the
submission
has
to
result
in
the
physical
restraint
of
the
suspect,
otherwise
he
is
not
detained,
and
anything
that
he
does
prior
to
this
physical...
prior
to
his
becoming
physical
restrained,
is
therefore
not
suppressible.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
well,
in
chesternut
it
was...
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
court
eschewed
bright
line
rules.
the
court
that
the
state
is
offering
now,
that
there
is
no
detention
until
someone
is
physically
restrained,
is
essentially
the
position
that,
or
the
proposition
that
this
court
refused
to
adopt
in
michigan
v.
chesternut.
this
court
also
refused
to
adopt
the...
mr.
chesternut's
proposed
rule,
a
bright
line
rule
that
all
chases
are
detentions.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
decision
in
michigan
v.
chesternut
was
kind
of
a
compromise
of
these
two
positions.
and
i
think
the
opinion
in
chesternut
made
it
clear
that
the
facts
that
give
rise
to
these
cases
are
so
varied
and
different
that
each
case
must
be
decided
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
for
this
proposition--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--well,
i
think
brower
is
distinguishable
from
the
facts
of
this
case
here.
i
think
the
issues
in
brower
are
unrelated
to
the
issues
here.
for
example,
brower
was--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--yes.
and
indeed
there
was
an
acquisition
of
physical
control
there
of
the
most
dramatic
kind,
your
honor.
there
was
a
fatal
collision
into
a
roadblock.
but
what...
what
even
distinguishes
brower
more
is
that
brower
was
decided
after
mendenhall,
terry,
and
chesternut
made
no
mention
of
any
of
those
cases.
moreover,
brower
did
not
involve
any
question
of
the
moment
that
the
show
of
police
force
or
use
of
authority
constitutes
a
detention.
so
i
think
brower
was
kind
of
analyzed
on
its
own
facts,
and
we
would
urge
this
court
not
to
buy
this
brower...
bright
line
rule
that
they
are
relying
on
brower
for.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
is
urging
this
court
to
overrule
chesternut
with
brower,
without
having...
without
brower
having
made
any
mention
of
these
other
cases.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
maybe
supplementing
or
refuting
part
of
chesternut
with
this
rule
in
brower.
maybe
not
entirely
overruling
it,
but
supplementing
it
or--
continuing,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
of
appeal
here
relied
upon
chesternut
in
its
analysis
of
the
facts.
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
here
it
was
reasonable
for
the
court
of
appeal
to
conclude
that
a
person
in
hodari's
position
was
not
free
to
leave,
because
the
court
of
appeal
found
a
detention
in
this
11-foot
scenario
where
the
officer
was
blocking
his
path,
and
they
also
said
that
was
tantamount
to
a
physical
restraint.
this
opinion
is
consistent
with
the
cases
that
we
have
mentioned
in
our
brief,
so
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
right
standard
was
applied
here.
we
urge
this
court
to
give
deference
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
here,
just
as
this
court
did
in
the
most
recent
case
of
minnesota
v.
olson.
minnesota
v.
olson
demonstrates
that
when
a
reviewing
court
has
applied
the
proper
standard,
that
this
court
will
decline
invitations
to
micromanage
the
application
of
the
standard
to
the
facts,
even
if
this
court
does
not
endorse
the
outcome
of
the
lower
intermediate
court's
decision.
here
and
in
hodari
the
court
of
appeal
applied
the
correct
standard
to
the
facts,
a
fact-specific
application.
and
they
were
reasonable
in
concluding
that
hodari
was
detained
in
this
11-foot
scenario.
thus
we
would
ask
for
the
same
consideration
of
federal-state
comity
here
that
this
court
gave
in
minnesota
v.
olson.
and
we
would
urge
this
court
to
leave
the
case-by-case
management
or
administration
of
these
lower...
intermediate
court
decisions
to
the
lower
courts
rather
than
try
to
micromanage
them
in
this
court.
this
court
has
broad
powers,
but
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
micromanage
all
state
intermediate...
all
state
intermediate
appellate
court
opinions
or
decisions.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
discarding
of
contraband
as
a
result
of
police
action
is
a
reoccurring
one.
the
proliferation
of
state
cases
reflect
that.
but
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
want
to
take
all
of
these
cases
out
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
this
bright
line
rule.
inherent
in
this
bright
line
rule
is
an
element
of
harassment.
it
is
our
feeling
that
if
this
bright
line
rule
were
adopted
by
the
court
it
would
give
the
police
too
much
discretion.
the
state
assumes
that
the
police
will
not
overreach.
the
state
assumes
that
the
police
will
not
abuse
their
discretions.
the
state
assumes
that
the
police
will
not
harass
people
by
chasing
them
without
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
wrongdoing.
this
bright
line
rule
proposed
by
the
state
would
essentially
insulate
the
police
from
all
wrongdoing,
such
as
harassment,
overreaching,
and
abuses
of
discretion.
and
in
essence
the
state's
test
would
reward
police
misconduct.
for
example,
here
the
police
did
not
have
any
reasonable
suspicion
of
any
wrongdoing,
yet
they
engaged
in
this
pincer
movement
that
was
designed
to
cut
hodari
off,
find
out
who
he
was
and
what
he
was
up
to.
in
the
bright
line
rule,
under
the
bright
line
rule
any
abandonment
prior
to
the
actual
physical
restraint
would
then
not
be
suppressible.
since
terry
v.
ohio
this
court
has
recognized
that
while
an
officer
needs
flexibility
on
the
street,
there
must
be
some
limits
on
what
the
police
officers
can
do.
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
in
police-citizen...
that
in
police-citizen
encounters...
that
police-citizen
encounters
need
some
constitutional
protection.
so
based...
for
these
reasons
we
believe
that
this
court
in
chesternut
refused
to
adopt
the
bright
line
rule
that
would
remove
all
these
cases
from
scrutiny.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
hodari
is
19
years
old,
justice
blackmun.
he
resides
in
oakland,
california,
and
he
has
a
young
child.
so
he
is
alive
and
well.
when
hodari
was
confronted
by
the
officer,
he
was
effectively
detained.
instantaneous
with
the
detention,
with
the
illegal
detention,
was
the
discard
of
this
contraband.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
this
evidence
was
come
at
by
the
exploitation
of
the
illegal
detention.
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
because
the
abandonment
of
the
contraband
was
a
direct
consequence
of
the
illegal
police
action.
the
abandonment
was
not
a
product
of
hodari's
free
will.
he
had
no
time
for
reflection.
there
were
no
intervening
circumstances.
and
the
abandonment
was
a
direct
result
of
a
show
of
authority
and
the
panic
on
the
part
of
hodari.
under
brown
v.
illinois,
wong
sun
v.
united
states,
taylor
v.
alabama,
and
dunaway
v.
new
york,
unless
there
are
some
intervening
circumstances,
some
time
delay
indicating
reflection,
the
abandonment
will
not
be
an
act
of
free
will.
in
conclusion,
we
urge
that
this
court
adhere
to
the
mendenhall-chesternut
standard
as
the
proper
test.
the
court
of
appeal
applied
the
proper
test
here.
we
urge
this
court
to
defer
to
the
court
of
appeal's
application
of
the
proper
standard
to
this
fact-specific
situation.
the
objective
characteristics
of
this
pincer
movement
which
resulted
in
the
blocking
of
hodari's
path
meets
the
standards
this
court
has
set
forth
to
define
a
seizure
by
a
show
of
authority.
we
urge
this
court
not
to
repudiate
the
mendenhall-chesternut
standard
with
a
bright
line
rule.
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
i
have
nothing
further,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
well--
mr.
james
l.
lozenski
--i
have
no
response
to
that,
justice
white.
