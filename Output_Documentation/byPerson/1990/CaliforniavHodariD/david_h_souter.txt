mr.
niver,
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
it,
that
there's
no
fourth
amendment
violation
when
the
police
obtain
evidence
as
a
result
of
unlawful
conduct
by
them,
unless
that
unlawful
conduct
constitutes
a
completed
seizure?
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
souter
yeah,
but
that
in
your
view
would
amount
to
a
seizure,
because
it
would
be
a
submission
to
authority,
right?
justice
souter
okay.
would--
justice
souter
--all
right,
would
your...
would
your
position
be
different
if
instead
of
raising
the
issue
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
issue
had
been
raised
under
the
due
process
clause,
pure
and
simple?
justice
souter
somebody
says
there's
a
violation
of
due
process
in
obtaining
evidence
as
a
result
of
unlawful
police
conduct
and
using
that
evidence
in
trial.
justice
souter
so
that
for
evidentiary
purposes,
illegal
police
conduct
is
really
not
subject
to
regulation
unless
you
do
have
a
narrow
or
strict
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
souter
i
understand
your
point
on
that.
i
assume,
as
far
as
deterrence
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
that
no
policeman
chases
somebody
with
the
expectation
that
he
won't
stop
him,
or
says
halt
or
i'll
shoot
with
the
expectation
that
he
won't
halt,
and
that
therefore
he'll
be
able
to
get
away
with
his
unlawful
action.
i
mean,
i
assume,
ex
ante,
the
policeman
has
no
incentive
to
commit
an
unlawful
act
if
we
adopt
the
rule
that
you're
proposing
to
us.
