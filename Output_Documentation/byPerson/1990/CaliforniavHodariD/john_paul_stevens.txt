justice
stevens
may
i
ask--
--that's
a
pretty
serious
step,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
before
you
get
into
the
definition
of
seizure,
is
it
your
view
of
the
record
that
had
he
not
thrown
the
cocaine,
the
rock
or
whatever
it
was,
down,
he
would
not
have
been
stopped?
justice
stevens
he
would
have
been
seized?
justice
stevens
so
that
the
question
then
is
whether
there's
anything
illegal
about
an
attempted
seizure?
justice
stevens
anything
illegal
about
an
attempted
seizure
without
articulable
suspicion.
justice
stevens
and
is
it
not
rather
clear
that
that
should
be
illegal?
justice
stevens
so
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
apply
to
attempted
illegal
conduct
by
the
police?
justice
stevens
is
it
not
clear
from
what
you
have
acknowledged
that
the
reason
he
threw
the
rock
away
is
that
the
police
were
in
the
act
of
attempting
to
conduct
an
illegal
seizure?
isn't
that
what
prompted
him
to
throw
the
rock
away?
justice
stevens
why
do
you
think
he
threw
it
away?
justice
stevens
who
was
in
an
illegal
attempt
to
try
and
seize
him
at
the
very
moment,
was
he
not?
you
just
acknowledged
that.
justice
stevens
mr.
niver,
you
make
a
point
of
the
fact
it
would
have
been
just
a
terry
stop
rather
than
an
arrest.
it
would
have
been
a
terry
stop
without
any
articulable
suspicion,
would
it
not?
justice
stevens
so
it
would
have
been
equally
illegal
as
an
arrest.
justice
stevens
just
as
much
as
a
terry...
just
as
much
as
an
arrest
would.
justice
stevens
what
if
the
police
officer
fired
a
couple
of
warning
shots,
and
the
fellow
still
ran
and
then
threw
the
rock
away?
justice
stevens
so
that
even
shooting
at
him
wouldn't
be
enough?
justice
stevens
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical.
supposing
an
officer
comes
up
to
somebody
he
has
no
basis
for
suspecting,
pulls
a
gun
on
him
and
says,
from
a
distance
across
the
room,
says
disarm
yourself,
throw
any
weapon
you
may
have
in
your
pocket
to
the
ground,
and
the
fellow
does
it,
and
then
after
that
he
arrests
him.
is
that
lawful
conduct?
does
that
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
stevens
why?
the
fellow
wasn't
under...
at
the
time
of
the
command
all
he
knew
is
that
he
was
being...
and
say
he
runs
away
then
and
he
never
catches
the
man.
he
never
catches
him,
so
there
is
never
a
successful
seizure.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
so...
does
that
mean
there
was
a
seizure
or
was
there
not
a
seizure?
justice
stevens
even
though
he
never
caught
him?
even
though
he
never
subdued
him?
justice
stevens
but
he
was
never
under
the
control
of
the
officer,
under
your
argument
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
so
if
this
man
understood
the
chase
to
be
a
show
of
authority
where
he
was
attempting
to
catch
him,
then
it
would
be
a
seizure
and
it
would
have
been
an
illegal
seizure?
and
throwing
it
away
would
be
just
like
throwing
the
gun
away?
justice
stevens
well,
my
fellow
threw
the
gun
on
the
ground
and
then
ran,
and
he
never
got
caught.
justice
stevens
so
the
thing
that's
wrong
here
is
there
is
no...
nothing
equivalent
to
an
order
to
stop
or
an
order
to
throw
the
rock
away?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
sloan,
is
that
any
more
anomalous
than
the
hypothetical
i
gave
and
the
answer
counsel
gave
of
pulling
the
gun
on
the
man
and
say
drop
your
weapon,
and
then
he
runs
away
and
he
never
gets
caught?
was
there
a
seizure
in
that
case?
justice
stevens
he's
running
the
entire
time.
justice
stevens
but
is
it
correct
there's
no
evidence
that
they
knew
whether
they
were
police
officers
or...
or
perhaps
rival
distributors
of
illegal
substances
who
might
have
been
after
them?
they
don't...
we
don't
know
from
the
record,
do
we?
they
could
have
run
from
people
other
than
police
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
stevens
well,
for
example,
had
the
officers
got
out
of
the
car
before
they
started
to
run?
justice
stevens
so
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
see
what
was
on
their
jackets,
would
they?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
sloan,
in
my
other
hypothetical
you
said
you
wanted
to
ask
if
the
fellow
was
running.
supposing
he
was
standing
there
and
the
officer
points
a
gun
at
him
and
says
drop
your
weapon.
he
dropped
his
weapon,
then
runs.
is
it
now
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
say
he
has
been
seized?
justice
stevens
well,
he
threw
his
gun
on
the
ground
pursuant
to
the
command--
justice
stevens
--and
then
ran.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
no,
my
facts
are
he
just
threw
the
gun
on
the
ground
and
ran,
and
was
never
caught.
justice
stevens
mr.
lozenski,
can
i
clear
up
something
on
the
facts,
especially
about
this
11
feet?
is
it
not
correct
that
the
testimony
of
the
officer
indicates
that
he
was
11
feet
away
when
the
fellow
threw
the
rock
to
the
ground,
but
it
does
not
tell
us
how
far
away
when
he,
he
was
when
he
saw
the
police
officer?
as
i
read
it,
i
don't
think
it
tells
you
just
what
that
distance
was.
justice
stevens
no,
he
said
it's
just
about
the
same.
when
he
threw
the
stuff
away
he
was
about
the
same
distance
as
he
is
from
me
right
now.
justice
stevens
but
he
did
not
say
how
far
he
was
when
he
turned
around
and
saw
him.
isn't
that
correct?
i
think
it
is,
anyway.
justice
stevens
the
testimony
doesn't
say
that.
