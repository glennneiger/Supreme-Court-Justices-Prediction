justice
o'connor
now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
police
are
free
to
chase
somebody
without
any
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion?
justice
o'connor
and
there's
no
evidence
that
the
defendant
understood
it
was
a
police
vehicle
or
police
in
it?
justice
o'connor
yeah.
you
think
that
alone
is
enough
to
make
a
reasonable
person
believe
they're
not
free
to
go,
seeing
someone
running
towards
you?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
we
didn't
have
any
evidence
about
the
manner.
it
was
just
two
people
running
at
each
other,
i
mean,
in
the
same...
in
opposite
directions.
justice
o'connor
do
we
have
other
evidence?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
if
a
police
officer
is
running
down
the
sidewalk
towards
someone,
and
there
is
a
jogger
running
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
the
police
officer,
that
that
alone
constitutes
a
seizure?
justice
o'connor
but
we
don't
have
any
evidence
of
that.
there
was
no
gun
drawn,
there
was
no
order
to
stop.
we
aren't
told
of
any
other
evidence,
except
running
towards
each
other.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
we
make
an
objective
inquiry.
we
don't
look
at
what
the
officer's
intent
might
have
been,
do
we?
we
look
at
the
objective
facts
and
what
a
reasonable
person
would
believe,
whether
he
has
been
seized.
justice
o'connor
now
if
the
defendant
just
keeps
running,
when
does
the
seizure
end,
do
you
suppose?
you
say
there
is
a
seizure--
justice
o'connor
--when,
when
the
defendant
sees
the
policeman
running
towards
him.
when
would
that
seizure
end
if
the
defendant
just
keeps
running?
justice
o'connor
and
isn't
caught.
justice
o'connor
um-hum.
justice
o'connor
what
point?
justice
o'connor
when
does
he
escape?
justice
o'connor
it
seems
to
me
it
leaves
a
lot
of
unanswered
questions
there
on
the
back
end
of
your
position.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
word
"seizure"
in
the
fourth
amendment
includes
attempted
seizure?
justice
o'connor
what
makes
it
a
seizure?
what
do
you
think
a
seizure
includes
in
normal
parlance?
any
element
of
control
there?
i
mean
how
can,
how
can
it
be
a
seizure
if
the
person
never
stops
running,
and
in
fact
is
never
controlled
by
the
police?
how
can
that
be
a
seizure?
and
yet
under
your
theory
it
is.
