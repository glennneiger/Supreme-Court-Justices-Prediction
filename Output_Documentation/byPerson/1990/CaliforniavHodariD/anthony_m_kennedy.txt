justice
kennedy
well,
that
there's
no
unreason...
that
there's
no
suspicion
to
stop
as
of
what
point?
justice
kennedy
in...
all
right.
in
your
view
does
the
fact
that
someone
in
the
defendant's
circumstances
here
is
running
away,
some
evidence
that
would
give
rise
to
a
reasonable
articulable
suspicion?
justice
kennedy
after
the
running
began?
justice
kennedy
in
your
view,
when
the
police
office
puts
on
red
lights
behind
a
car,
when
does
the
stop
take
place?
when
the
red
lights
are
put
on
or
when
the
car
pulls
over
to
the
curb?
justice
kennedy
and
if
there
is
no
basis
for
the
stop,
suppose
the
car
pulls
away
at
a
high
speed?
justice
kennedy
can
the
police
officer
acquire
a
basis
for
stopping
the
car
after
it
pulls
away
at
a
high
speed,
if
he
had
no
basis
to
turn
on
the
lights
to
begin
with?
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
police
officer
has
no
basis
for
turning
on
the
red
lights,
but
does
so
anyway.
justice
kennedy
the
car
then
pulls
away
at
a
high
speed.
is
the
police
officer
justified
in
pursuing
and
stopping?
justice
kennedy
just
the
circumstances
i
give.
justice
kennedy
well,
let's
forget
high
speed.
justice
kennedy
suppose
he
pulled...
ignores
the
lights
and
continues?
justice
kennedy
you
think
there
would
be
basis
for
a
reasonable
suspicion
at
that
point?
justice
kennedy
suppose
he
does
acquiesce
in
the
authority.
he
said...
the
police
officer
without
any
basis
says
stop,
i
want
to
talk
to
you.
that's
all
he
says.
and
the
defendant
says
you've
got
me
and
throws
out
the
gun.
then
what?
justice
kennedy
and
so
what
is
the
result
with
reference
to
the
gun?
justice
kennedy
can
you
argue
that
here?
justice
kennedy
well,
under
your
analysis
you...
mr.
hodari
should
have
said,
mr.
police
officer,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
you
have
made
a
mistake.
so
you
take
this
rock
of
cocaine
and
do
what
you
want
with
it,
but
you
can't
introduce
it
against
me
at
trial.
[laughter]
that's
what
he
should
have
done?
justice
kennedy
you're
arguing
that
the
police,
by
beginning
to
chase,
have
automatically
granted
immunity
from
introducing
the
evidence,
because
he
either...
one,
he
can
run
away
and
be
successful,
or
two,
he
can
go
to
the
officer
and
say
you
have
made
a
mistake,
here's
the
cocaine
but
you
can't
introduce
it.
justice
kennedy
but
if
he
drops
the
cocaine
when
the
officer
might
have
had
some
hope
of
catching
him,
then
there's
a
seizure
and
that
can't
be
introduced
if
you
later
find
him
3
weeks
later
and
try
him
and
arrest
him?
