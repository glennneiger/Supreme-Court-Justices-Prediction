mr.
ronald
e.
niver
niver,
sir.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
california
court
of
appeal
reversed
a
finding
of
juvenile
wardship
against
respondent,
holding
first
that
he
had
been
seized
under
the
fourth
amendment,
second
that
the
detention
was
without
reasonable
cause
to
detain,
and
third,
the
rock
of
cocaine
which
he
discarded
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
was
the
fruit
of
that
detention.
today
we
challenge
the
first
and
third
conclusions.
we
argue
that
respondent
had
not
been
seized
when
he
dropped
his
contraband,
and
that
in
any
event
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
was
not
the
product
of
any
illegality.
the
relevant
facts
are
that
about
10:00
p.m.
on
april
18,
1988,
two
officers
were
on
routine
patrol
in
an
unmarked
car
in
oakland
when
they
turned
a
corner
to
see,
about
40
yards
away
from
them,
four
young
men
talking
to
the
driver
of
a
car
parked
on
the
street.
when
they
looked
toward
the
police
car,
the
driver
sped
away
and
the
pedestrians
ran
away.
the
officers
drove
to
the
approximate
place
where
the
men
had
been
standing,
and
one
of
them,
officer
pertoso,
got
out
of
the
car.
the
other
officer,
mccolgin,
drove
in
the
general
direction
toward
which
two
of
the
pedestrians
had
run
away.
but
officer
pertoso
ran
the
other
way
in
an
effort
to
intercept
one
or
more
of
them.
and
that
is
just
what
happened.
as
officer
pertoso
turned
the
corner
he
saw
respondent
running
toward
him,
but
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
if
to
see
if
he
were
being
followed.
when
he
turned
to
face
the
officer,
the
two
men
were
11
feet
away
from
each
other.
at
this
point
the
officer
had
said
nothing
to
respondent.
respondent
then
did
two
things.
first
he
threw
an
object
onto
the
sidewalk,
and
then
he
continued
toward
the
officer,
who
forced
him
to
the
ground
and
handcuffed
him.
the
officer
then
recovered
the
object,
which
proved
to
be
a
rock
of
cocaine.
we
first
address
the
question
of
seizure.
a
seizure--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--we
have
never
contested
that,
your
honor,
and
the
case
comes
to
this
court
based
upon
the
premise,
the
assumption
that
there
was
no
articulable
suspicion.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
well,
because
there
was
a
finding
by
the
trial
court
which
was
not
contested
in
the
trial
court.
when
it
came
to
the
california
court
of
appeal
we
did
not
change
theories.
it
has
always
been
litigated
under
those
circumstances.
and
when
it
came
to
this
court
we
chose
to
maintain
our
position.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
as
of
the
point
that
the...
at
the
point
before
respondent
dropped
his
rock
of
cocaine.
the
finding
was
that
there
was
no
basis
to
chase
him.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
some
evidence.
correct.
the
court
of
appeal
so
concluded,
but,
consistent
with
state
law
at
the
time,
found
that
flight
without
more
is
not
sufficient.
it's
relevant,
but
not
sufficient.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
we
take
the
position
that
it
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
until
that
person
has
actually
been
restrained.
that
is
the
position
which
we
urge
upon
this
court
today.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
yes,
your
honor.
but
to...
we
believe
that
this
is
consistent
with
this
court's
case
law.
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
composed
of
two
distinct
elements,
two
dimensions.
first--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--oh,
he
would
have
been
stopped.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
that's
exactly
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
your
honor,
our
position
is
to
the
contrary.
our
position
is
it
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
until
there
is
actual
restraint.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
it
does
not
violate...
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
does
not
violate
this
person's
right
under
the
fourth
amendment
until
he
is
actually
seized.
an
attempted
seizure
is
not
mentioned
in
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
in
this
court's
cases.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
at
that
point
it
was
probably
probable
cause.
it
was
probable
cause,
yes.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
at
the
time
he
seized
him
physically
he
had
more
than
terry
suspicion.
he
had--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
he
was
prompted...
your
honor,
yes,
your
honor...
no,
your
honor.
he
was
prompted
to--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--we
will
never
know,
because
the
record
does
not
articulate
it.
he...
let's
put
it...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
he
threw
it
away
because
he
saw
a
police
officer.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
we
have
never
acknowledged
that
at
that
point
there
was
a
show
of
authority.
all
he
saw
was
a
police
officer
running
after
him.
even
if,
taking
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeal
and
the
respondent,
there
was
a
show
of
authority,
there
was
no
manifestation
to
this
person
that
he
would
have
been
searched,
only
that
he
would
have
been
seized.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
nothing
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
entirely,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
the
officer
testified
that
he
wanted
to
stop
him
and
question
him
about
why
he
ran
away.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
from
the
officer's
testimony--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--a
terry
stop.
he
did
not
intend
to
arrest
him
when
he
went
after
him.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
finding
of
wardship
was
simple
possession.
so,
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
have
any--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
it
would...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
it
would
have
violated
the
fourth
amendment
to
detain
him--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
after
the
running
began,
the
running
by
itself,
the
court
of
appeal
found,
was
not
sufficient
to
detain
him.
we
have
not
challenged
that
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
they
were...
there
is...
no,
your
honor.
they
were
not
admitted
against
him
for
the
finding
of
the
wardship.
the
only
evidence
used
against
him
to
establish
wardship
was
the
single
rock
of
cocaine
which
he
discarded
at
the
time
he
confronted
the
officer.
there
was
a
bag
of
15
rocks,
but
they
were
never
found
to
be
either
possessed
by
him
or
in
fact
even
cocaine.
the
only
question
before
this
court
was
the
legality
of
the
seizure
of
the
single
rock.
continuing
on
the
matter
of
the
elements
of
a
seizure,
this
court
has
acknowledged,
has
defined
a
seizure
in
its
case
law
as
composed
of
two
distinct
elements:
some
official
action
and
restraint
upon
the
movement
of
the
citizen
at
whom
the
action
is
directed.
that
has
been
the
rule
since
terry
v.
ohio
defined
a
seizure
as
physical
force
or
show
of
authority
which
has
restrained
the
liberty
of
a
citizen.
since
terry
this
court
has
found...
had
occasion
to
define
the
parameters
of
both
elements.
with
regard
to
the
requirement
of
a
display
of
authority,
this
court
has
said,
beginning
in
a
plurality
of
cases,
of
mendenhall
and
royer,
and
concluding
with
delgado
and
chesternut,
that
an
objective
standard
requires
the
question
whether
an
official
action
was
such
that
a
reasonable
person
would
have
believed
that
he
or
she
was
not
free
to
leave.
respondent
suggests
that
that
test
replaced
that
set
forth
in
terry,
but
we
believe
this
is
conceptually
incorrect.
mendenhall
and
its
progery
did
not
dispense
with
the
requirement
of
restraint.
this
may
be
illustrated
by
a
simple
example.
if
an
officer
says
to
a
pedestrian,
stop
in
the
name
of
the
law,
and
the
person
flees,
never
to
be
caught,
he
has
not
been
seized
in
any
physical
or
constitutional
sense.
the
reason
is
that
the
second
element,
restraint
upon
movement,
has
not
been
satisfied.
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
person
has
been
seized
in
the
absence
of
restraint
by
police.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
if
he
ran
and
escaped
apprehension,
he
has
not
been
seized.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
it
would
be
a
display
of
authority,
certainly.
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
absent
of
restraint.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
when
the
car
pulls
over
to
the
curb--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--then
the
seizure
has
terminated.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
i'm
not
sure
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
yes.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
i
would
say
that
if
there
are
other
circumstances
present,
certainly.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
a
high-speed
chase,
i
would
suggest--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--all
right.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
i
would
think
so,
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
at
that
point,
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
a
high
speed
that
is
suggesting--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--something...
either
speeding
or
something
suspicious
about
the
circumstances
of
leaving.
or,
for
example,
in
terms
of
officer...
highway
safety,
something
unsafe
about
it.
there
are
a
lot
of
circumstances
involving
cars
that
do
not
arise
in
the
streetside
detentions.
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
violation,
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
implicated
by
a
detention
in
the
absent...
absence
of
restraint
by
police.
now
a
restraint
upon
liberty
does
not
mean
only
an
application
of
physical
force,
such
as
the
use
of
handcuffs.
instead
the
concept
of
restraint
is
broader
and
includes
submission
by
the
officer
to
a
display
of
authority.
the
true
test
is
not
the
use
of
force
or
the
absence
of
force,
but
the
presence
of
control
over
the...
by
the
officer
over
the
citizen.
the
contours
of
this
element
were
explored
by
this
court's
recent
decision
in
brower
v.
county
of
inyo.
there
the
court
characterized
the
seizure
as
a
governmental
termination
of
freedom
of
movement
through
means
intentionally
applied.
respondent
suggests
this
test,
even
if
relevant,
is
satisfied
if
the
person
cannot
go
wherever
he
wants
because
of
the
presence
of
the
police,
but
this
open-ended
view
of
a
seizure
is
inconsistent
with
brower's
declaration
that
a
seizure
is
an
intentional
acquisition
of
physical
control.
the
overarching
principle,
then,
is
control.
even
if
there
is
a
show
of
authority,
if
a
person
can
avoid
the
officer's
control
and
does
so,
there
is
no
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
this
case
we
have
argued
in
the
briefs
that
there
was
not
even
a
show
of
authority
in
this
case.
but
even
if
there
was,
even
if
the
respondent
reasonably
believed
that
the
officer
was
attempting
to
detain
him,
there
was
no
physical
control
over
the
respondent
at
the
time
that
he
discarded
his
rock
of
cocaine.
rather,
he
did
not
acquiesce
in
the
officer's
presence.
instead
he
dropped
the
rock
of
cocaine
and
continued
to
move.
the
officer
had
to
force
him
to
the
ground
and
handcuff
him.
the
court
of
appeal
below
said
that
his
movement,
the
direction
of
his
path
was
influenced
by
the
officer--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
at
the...
well,
he
was
ordered
to
drop
his
weapon.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
his
act
in
dropping
the
weapon
was
a
submission
to
the
officer's
authority.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
a
seizure...
there
was
a
seizure
of
the
person
and
there
was
a
seizure
of
his
weapon.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
the
seizure
ended
when
he
ran
away
and
was
not...
when
he
ran
from
the
control
of
the
officer.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
our
argument
is
that
if
a
person
submits
to
a
show
of...
submits
to
a
show
of
authority--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--at
that
point
he
is
seized.
it
doesn't
require
physical
control,
not
in
the
sense
that
the
officer
and
the
person
are
standing
next
to
each
other.
it
requires
submission.
if
a
person
objectively
submits
to
the
show
of
authority
by
a
police
officer,
that
is
a
detention
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
in
this
case...
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
in
this
case
it
was
not
a
submission
because
he
attempted
to
run.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
he
was
ordered
to
do
so,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
or
unless
the
police
officer
has
ordered
the
person
to--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
it's
very
much...
it's--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--if
the
respondent
had
argued--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--well,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
not
so
held
since
roshan.
i
don't
believe...
no,
i
don't
believe
that
a
motion
to
suppress
under
the
due
process
clause
would
be...
would
be
cognizable.
unless
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment,
the
evidence
is
admissable.
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
well,
not
all
intrusive
police
conduct
violates
the
constitution,
and
if
it
does
violate
the
constitution,
it
does
not
necessarily
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
to
be
suppressible,
the
police
conduct
has
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
at
the
time
of
the
officer
confronted
the
respondent,
who
then
dropped
his
rock,
that
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
because,
number
one,
he
was
not
under
the
police
officer's
control
and
there
was
no
seizure
of
his--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--there
is
already--
mr.
ronald
e.
niver
--there
is
already
in
place
an
exclusionary
rule
which
advises
the
officer
that
if
he
chases
him
and
if
he
seizes
him
and
if
he
searches
him,
that
evidence
will
be
excluded.
thank
you.
