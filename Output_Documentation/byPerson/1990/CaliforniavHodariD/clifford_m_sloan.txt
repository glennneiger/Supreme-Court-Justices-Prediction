mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
term
seizure
in
the
fourth
amendment.
in
our
view
control
is
an
essential
element
of
the
seizure.
control
can
be
achieved
through
actual
physical
control
or
a
coercive
assertion
of
governmental
authority
and
citizen
acquiescence
in
that
authority.
in
respondent's
view,
no
control
is
necessary.
one
way
of
understanding
the
difference
between
our
position
and
respondent's
position
is
to
consider
if
the
facts
of
this
case
were
exactly
the
same,
with
one
change.
and
that
is
that
respondent
had
succeeded
in
alluding
the
police
after
throwing
down
his
rock
of
cocaine.
in
respondent's
view,
a
seizure
would
nevertheless
have
taken
place,
and
the
cocaine
must
nevertheless
be
suppressed,
even
though
the
police
might
not
succeed
in
apprehending
respondent
for
a
period--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
if
i
could
ask
for
one
point
of
clarification
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens.
does
the
individual
stop
at
all,
or
is
he
running
the
entire
time
and
throws
the
gun
away?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
if
he's
running
the
entire
time,
i
think
there
is
not
a
seizure
of
the
person.
there
is
a
seizure
of
the
gun,
just
as
in
this
case
the
respondent
was
running
the
entire
time,
and
there
is
not
a
seizure
when
he
is
running.
if
he
stops,
then
it's
acquiescence
to
the
authority.
but
if
he's
running
the
entire
time
there
is
not
a
seizure
of
the
person.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
i...
no,
i
did
not
say
that,
your
honor.
i
said
that...
in
fact
it's
quite
clear
that
it's
our
position
that
the
seizure
did
not
take
place
until
the
officer
actually
gained
control
of
the
individual.
until
that--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
what
the
record
reveals
is
that
officer
pertoso
was
running
up
a
street
in
one
direction,
respondent
was
running--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no,
he
did
not.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
what
is
revealed
in
the
record
is
that
he
had
a
jacket
that
said
police
on
it.
he
was
in
an
unmarked
car.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
apparently--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no,
your
honor,
but
the
evidence
is
that
he
saw
the
car
with
the
individuals
in
it
as
he
stood
there
before
he
ran.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
he
was
running
towards
the
officer
at
the
time
of
the
event
that
the
actual
seizure...
that
the
throwing
away
of
the
rock
of
cocaine
took
place
and
the
eventual
seizure.
the
individuals
ran
away
from
the
police
when
they
were
standing
around
the
car
and
saw
the
police
car
emerge.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
we
entirely
agree,
justice
marshall,
that
when
he
saw
him
throw
away
the
rock
of
cocaine,
that
furnished
probable
cause
for
the...
for
the
arrest.
we
entirely
agree
with
that
proposition.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
in
our
view
it's
quite
clear
that
there
was
not
a
seizure
before
then,
and
that
was
in
fact
the
fallacy
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
was
that
they
thought
that
it
was
critical--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--it
was,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
what
the
evidence
is
that's
in
the
record,
and
it's
the
testimony
of
the
two
officers
at
the
suppression
hearing,
is
that
they
did...
they
had
jackets
on
that
said
police.
they
were
driving
an
unmarked
car.
whatever
inferences
are
drawn...
are
drawn
from
those
facts
that
are
in
the
record.
we
would
agree...
it
would
be
our
position
that
there
would
be
reasonable
suspicion
from
fleeing
from
police
if
they
reasonably
thought
it
was
police.
as
counsel
for
the
state
has
said.
that
issue
has
not
been
presented
in
the
petition
and
is
not
presented
in
the
case.
but
we
would
definitely
believe
that
that
would
be
reasonable
suspicion
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
it
is...
it
is
possible.
the
facts
in
the
record
are,
as
i
have
stated,
that
they
had
the
jackets
on--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no.
i
believe--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
probably
correct.
now,
it's
possible
in
some
of
the
case
law
there
are
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
about
this
as
a
brown
unmarked
dodge
in
this
particular
neighborhood,
but
the
only
evidence
is
the
testimony
of
the
officers
and
the
reaction
of
those
individuals
when
they
ran.
but
that...
whether
they
recognized
they
were
police
or
not
really
doesn't
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
seizure.
it
would
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
or
not--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--which
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
but
it
doesn't
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
seizure
or
not.
the
thrust
of
our
position
is
that
it
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
say
that
an
individual
is
at
the
same
time
in
flight
and
has
been
seized,
and
that
is
the
burden
of
respondent's
position
and
it
is
the
burden
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
now,
the
fourth
amendment
addresses
the
seizure--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--if,
when
he
was
standing
there,
an
objective
observer
would
say
that
he
had
manifested
acquiescence--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
throwing--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--i
think
that
the
throwing
of
the
object
is
distinct
from
the
question
of
the
seizure
of
the
person.
in
one
instance
you're
talking
about
the
seizure
of
the
person.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
there
is
clearly
a
seizure
of
the
gun
in
that
instance.
now
as
to
whether
the
person
has
been
seized
it
would
be
a
close
factual
question
in
that
situation
whether
he
had
manifested
acquiescence.
if
he
held
up
his
hands
and
said
you've
got
me,
or
something--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
in
those...
under
those
facts
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
a
seizure,
because
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything,
aside
from
the
throwing
down
of
the
gun,
that
manifests
acquiescence
in
the
coercive
assertion
of
authority
for
the
seizure
of
the
person.
the
mere
throwing
down
of
an
object
is
not
itself
sufficient
to
establish
acquiescence
in
the
authority.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
in
that
circumstance
there,
there
has
been
a
seizure.
now,
that
would
then
present
the
second
question,
which
is
whether,
once
there
has
been
a
seizure
the,
the
gun
that
is
dropped,
or
drugs
in
another
situation,
after
an
officer
just
says
stop,
i
want
to
talk
to
you,
should
be
suppressed
as
fruits
of
the
poisonous
tree,
and
we
would
submit
that
it
should
not
be.
but
that's
for
a
separate
reason.
but
under
your
hypothetical,
justice
kennedy,
there
clearly
has
been
a
seizure
of
the
person.
the
officer
orders
him
to
stop
and
he
stops.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
with
reference
to
the
gun
it
would
be
our
position
that
it
is
not
a
fruit
of
the
unlawful
seizure,
because
the
decision
to
throw
down
the
gun
in
that
circumstance
is
a
sufficient
intervening
independent
act
of
free
will.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
we
can,
and
we
do.
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeal
is
correct
and
respondent
is
correct
that
control
is
not
necessary
to
the
seizure
and
that
a
person
can
at
the
same
time
be
in
flight
and
be
seized,
the
independent
act
of
throwing
down
the
drugs
not
in
response
to
any
order
or
any
indication
from
the
police
that
that
is
what
he's
supposed
to
do
is
a
sufficient
intervening
independent
act
of
free
will.
on
that
point
the
court's
cases
on
the
exclusionary
rule
are
quite
clear
that
there
has
to
be
an
exploitation
of
the
illegality,
but
for
causation
is
not
itself
sufficient.
there
has
to
be
something
purposeful
by
the
exploitation
of
the
illegality.
and
in
that
instance
there
would
not
be
such
an
exploitation.
now,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
strongly
supports
the
conclusion
that
control
is
an
element
of
a
seizure.
the
common
understanding
of
the
term
at
the
time
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
and
as
it
is
today,
is
that
a
seizure
requires
an
element
of
control.
and
that
is
revealed...
the
historical
evidence,
that
is
revealed
in
dictionaries
of
the
18th
and
19th
century,
in
early
decisions
construing
the
term
seizure,
and
in
early
state
constitutions
that
equated
the
concepts
of
arrest
and
of
seizure.
now
this
court
has
never
found
there
to
be
a
seizure
when
there
has
not
been
some
element
of
governmental
control
in
either
of
the
senses
that
i
have
described.
respondent
suggests
that
we
are
advocating
some
major
change
in
the
law.
in
fact
respondent's
conclusion
would
lead
to
a
fundamental
change
in
the
law,
because
it
would
be
the
first
time
that
this
court
had
ever
held
that
there
was
a
seizure
without
any
element
of
governmental
control.
the
principle
that
a
seizure
requires
an
element
of
governmental
control
provides
a
clear
and
coherent
interpretation
of
the
term
seizure.
respondent's
view,
in
contrast,
is
virtually
limitless,
and
it
would
lead
to
some
absurd
consequences.
