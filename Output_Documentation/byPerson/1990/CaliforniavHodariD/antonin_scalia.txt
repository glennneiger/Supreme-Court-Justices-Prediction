justice
scalia
is
it
anything
more
than
guessing
whether
they
would
have
arrested
him
if
he
hadn't
thrown
it
away?
justice
scalia
a
terry
stop
or
an
arrest?
justice
scalia
and
i
suppose
in
one
example--
--is
this
high
speed
above
the
speed
limit?
i...
justice
stevens
and
i
were...
when
you
say
he
pulls
away
at
a
high
speed,
do
you
mean
a
high
speed
above
the
speed
limit,
or...
what
was
your
answer
assuming?
justice
scalia
within
the
speed
limit?
justice
scalia
i
thought
he
was
running
towards
the
officer
anyway?
justice
scalia
did
he
submit?
did
he
stop?
that
isn't
in
the
record,
that
he
stopped.
justice
scalia
mr.
lozenski,
they
must
have
been
running
awfully
slowly.
as
i
understand
it,
he
is
looking
behind
him,
and
he
turns
around
and
he
sees,
he
sees
the
policeman
11
feet
away.
justice
scalia
and
he,
and
he
still
has
time
to
throw
away
the
rock
of
cocaine
and
somehow
to
stop
from
colliding
with
him?
11
feet
away,
and
they
are
both
running
towards
each
other?
justice
scalia
but
i
thought
we
have
said
otherwise.
i
thought,
you
know,
if
you
put
up
a
roadblock
and
the
person...
you're
blocking
the
road
and
the
person
doesn't
stop
for
it
but
tries
to
go
around
it,
has
he
been
seized?
justice
scalia
an
attempt
to
stop
him,
he
would.
he
would.
but
so
would
the
reasonable
person,
when
the
policeman
says
stop
or
i'll
shoot,
and
he
keeps
running.
is
that
a
seizure?
a
reasonable
person
knows
he's
trying
to
seize
him.
but
i
thought
you
said
an
attempted
seizure
is
not
a
seizure?
justice
scalia
but
that...
doesn't
that
depend
on
whether
the
person
stops
or
not?
he
either
stops
at
the
roadblock
or
he
doesn't.
he
either
stops
when
the
policeman
says
stop
or
i'll
shoot
or
he
doesn't.
justice
scalia
he's
still
seized
while
he's
running?
he's
still
running,
but
he's
seized?
justice
scalia
and
that,
that...
you
see
a
scenario,
policeman
running
down
the
street
and
the
suspect
running
ahead
of
him,
and
the
policeman
shouting
stop,
stop,
thief.
that
has
been
a
seizure,
while
he--
justice
scalia
--even
while
he's
running
he
is
seized?
justice
scalia
well--
--but
at
a
certain
point
if
he
starts
running
faster
than
the
officer
and
gets
away,
the
seizure
ceases?
justice
scalia
well,
we
might
say
you'll
need
both.
that
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
objective
show
of
authority,
that
any
reasonable
person
would
take
as
a
show
of
authority,
and
in
addition
there
has
to
be
submission
to
that
authority.
what...
what's
the
matter
with
that?
that
wouldn't
abandon
the
requisite
objective
standard
of
show
of
authority.
justice
scalia
well,
i
understand
you
object
to
it.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
a
basis
for
your
objecting
to
it
is
not
that
we
would
be
abandoning
the
objective
test
of
a
show
of
authority.
we
would
still
require
that.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
think
about
the
opinion
in
brower?
justice
scalia
there
was
a
car
instead
of
a
foot
chase.
but
we
did
say
that
seizure
requires
an
intentional
acquisition
of
physical
control.
justice
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
overruling
chesternut.
chesternut
was
decided
the
same
way
as
it
would
be
under
this
theory,
but
on
a
different
ground.
that
other
ground
isn't
available
here.
it
wouldn't
be
overruling
the
case.
it
would
be
just
using
a
theory
that
chesternut
found
it
unnecessary
to
use.
that's
really
not
overruling
it,
i
don't
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
first
appellate
district.
late
one
evening,
two
police
officers
were
cruising
in
a
high
crime
area
of
oakland,
california.
as
they
turned
the
corner,
they
noticed
a
group
of
youth
huddled
around
a
car.
when
the
youth
saw
the
officers’
car
approaching,
they
fled
as
did
the
car
around
which
they
had
been
congregated.
some
of
them
ran
further
down
the
same
street
pursued
by
one
of
the
officers
in
the
car.
two
of
them
including
respondent,
hodari
d.
run
into
an
alley
which
lead
over
to
the
next
street.
the
second
officer,
having
left
the
car,
run
back
up
to
the
top
of
the
street
over
the
next
street
where
the
alley
came
out
and
back
down
towards
the
alley.
he
found
himself
running
directly
at
hodari
who
did
not
see
him
at
first
because
hodari
was
looking
behind
as
he
ran.
about
11
feet
from
the
officer,
hodari
turned
and
saw
the
officer
and
at
that
point
threw
away
some
drugs.
the
officer
then
tackled
hodari
and
the
drugs
were
retrieved
by
the
police.
in
a
juvenile
proceeding
brought
against
hodari,
the
court
refused
to
suppress
evidence
of
the
abandoned
drugs.
the
california
court
of
appeal
reversed.
in
that
court’s
view,
hodari
was
seized
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
he
was
chased
and
the
seizure
was
unreasonable
because
the
officer
did
not
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
conduct
that
would
justify
a
stop.
the
california
supreme
court
refused
review
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeal.
we
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
the
officer
who
chased
hodari
had
no
reasonable
suspicion.
the
only
question
before
us
is
when,
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
hodari
was
actually
seized.
if
he
was
seized
before
he
disposed
of
the
drugs,
the
police’s
obtaining
of
the
drugs
could
be
viewed
as
the
product
of
the
unlawful
seizure
in
which
case
the
drugs
were
excludable
at
trial.
if
he
was
seized
after
he
disposed
of
the
drugs,
they
were
unquestionably
admissible
in
so
far
as
federal
law
is
concerned.
as
used
in
the
fourth
amendment,
a
seizure
when
applied
to
seizure
of
the
person
referred
to
an
arrest.
at
common
law,
an
arrest
could
be
affected
in
only
two
ways.
either
by
physically
grasping
the
person,
the
slightest
touching
would
suffice,
or
by
the
person’s
voluntary
submission
to
a
show
of
authority.
here,
there
was
neither.
the
officer
made
no
physical
contact
with
hodari
until
after
he
had
dropped
the
drugs,
and
hodari
had
not
yielded
to
any
show
of
authority
but
was
in
full
flight.
he
had
not
been
arrested.
he
had
not
been
seized.
the
police’s
possession
of
the
drugs
was
therefore
not
the
product
of
an
unlawful
seizure
and
they
could,
consistently
with
federal
law,
be
admitted
in
the
juvenile
proceeding
below.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeal
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
joins.
