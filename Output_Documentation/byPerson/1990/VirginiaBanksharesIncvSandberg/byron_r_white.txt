justice
white
leaving
it
open
sort
of
indicated
it
might
be
a
moot
question.
i
mean,
arguable
at
least.
justice
white
but
they
have
never
decided
it
in
an
adjudication,
have
they?
justice
white
so
this
might
just
be
appellate
counsel's
view
of
it?
justice
white
but
still
right?
justice
white
well,
i
thought
you
really
think
it's
a
question
of
law
as
to
what
the
essential
link
definition
is.
justice
white
right.
well,
what
was
your...
what
instruction
did
you
tender?
justice
white
what?
what
did
it
say?
justice
white
well,
that
isn't
what...
that's
a
question
of
law,
then,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
why
wouldn't
you
have...
why
didn't
you
tender
an
instruction
to
that
effect?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
you
don't
think,
then,
that
we
should
take
the
word
of
the
sec
on
this
point?
justice
white
well,
can't
you...
i
suppose
the
board's
responsible
for
the
proxy
statement,
isn't
it?
justice
white
but
prior
to
that
time
didn't
they
move
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
essential
link?
justice
white
can't
you
answer
that
yes
or
no?
justice
white
did
they
raise
this
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
so
you
think
below
they
conceded
this
was
an
essential
link?
justice
white
but
did
they...
did
the
court
leave
it
to
the
jury
to
decide
whether...
the
essential
link
question?
justice
white
well,
how
did...
and
did
he
tell
them
that
it
was
or
wasn't
necessary
to
solicit?
justice
white
well,
what
evidence...
how
would
the
jury
know
whether
it
was
necessary
or
not?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
what
was
the
other
reason?
justice
white
is
it
your
position
that
the
solicitation
was
required
by
virginia
law?
justice
white
and
so
you
don't
claim
that
if
it
was
that
would
be,
prove
the
essential
link?
justice
white
so
if
the
jury
found
for
you
and
they
had
to
find
there
was
an
essential
link,
the
only
evidence
that
there
was
relating
to
the
essential
link
was
the
evidence
that
you
just
mentioned?
justice
white
do
you
agree
with
that
paragraph
about
essential
link?
if
you
find
that
it
was
necessary...
quote,
necessary,
unquote...
if
the
solicitation
was
necessary,
then
it's
an
essential
link.
now
what
evidence
do
you
say
indicates
that
it
was
necessary?
justice
white
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
white
all
right,
so--
justice
white
let's
assume
they
had
objected
to
this
instruction
on
the
definition
of
the
essential
link.
you
say
that
the
instruction
is
absolutely
valid.
of
course,
the
sec
says
that
even
if
it
was
necessary,
it
was
wrong.
i
mean,
even
if
the
solicitation
was
necessary,
you
nevertheless
lose.
justice
white
isn't
that
what
their
position
is?
justice
white
and
that,
you
certainly
disagree
with
that?
justice
white
and
your
answer
is
that
that
position
was
never
pressed
or
objected
to
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
so
we
could
decide
this
case
for
you
by
just
saying
that
the
issue
that
the
petitioners
want
decided
is...
we
just
don't
decide
it,
because
it
wasn't
pressed
below,
and
so
we
don't
decide
it.
justice
white
we
leave
it
open.
justice
white
so
we
don't...
no
necessity
to
reject
the
sec's
position?
justice
white
your
argument
really
is
we
should
dismiss
it
as
improvidently
granted,
because
the
issue
we
want
to
decide...
the
sec
wants
us
to
decide
and
the
petitioners
want
to
decide,
just
isn't
before
us.
justice
white
mr.
dreeben,
you
say
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
jury.
maybe
the
instructions
didn't
present
those
issues,
but
there
was
evidence
with
respect
to
other
theories
of
causation.
justice
white
and
if
the
jury
had
to
find
that
that
was
necessary,
they
must
have
relied
on
that
evidence.
justice
white
well,
there
was
some
evidence
about
other
theories
of
causation,
wasn't
there?
justice
white
well,
like
the
conflict
of
interest.
justice
white
well,
and
the
jury
followed
their
instructions...
we
assume
they
did...
and
found
that
the
solicitation
was
necessary.
they
must
have
relied
on
some
evidence
that
was
in
the
record.
and
one
of
it,
for
example,
was
the
conflict
of
interest.
isn't
that
true?
justice
white
well,
what
evidence
do
you
suppose
the
jury
relies
on
to
find...
in
this
record,
to
find
that
the
solicitation
was
necessary?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
instruction
was
that
the
jury
itself
had
to
find
based
on
the
evidence.
and
this
concession
in
open
court,
was
that
evidence?
they're
supposed
to
rely
on
the
evidence.
justice
white
you
didn't
object
to
that
essential
link
instruction
on
page
426.
justice
white
to
that
specific
instruction,
that
specific
paragraph?
justice
white
did
you
press
this
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
you
did
or
didn't?
justice
white
i
suppose
we
could
get
your
briefs
and
read
what
you
said?
