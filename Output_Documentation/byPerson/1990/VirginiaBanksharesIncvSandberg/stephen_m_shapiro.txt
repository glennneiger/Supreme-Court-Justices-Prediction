mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court
has
explained
on
a
number
of
occasions,
expansive
interpretation
of
implied
securities
law
remedies
carries
with
it
a
danger,
a
danger
of
vexatious
litigation
and
erosion
of
basic
principles
of
federalism.
this
is
a
case
which
raises
those
same
fundamental
concerns.
this
is
a
merger
case
in
which
minority
shareholders
received
30
percent
more
for
their
shares
than
those
shares
ever
traded
for,
but
they
nonetheless
filed
suit
in
state
court
demanding
more
money.
plaintiffs
were
denied
an
appraisal
remedy
and
an
injunction
remedy
in
the
state
court,
and
the
state
supreme
court
ultimately
denied
review.
so
they
decided
to
bring
their
complaint
to
federal
court.
this
shift
in
forums
resulted
in
a
remarkable
improvement
in
plaintiffs'
fortunes.
under
the
fourth
circuit's
ruling
in
this
case,
more
than
$13
million
may
change
hands,
based
on
two
alleged
defects
in
the
proxy
statement
that
was
used
in
the
merger,
even
though
the
majority
shareholder
owned
enough
shares
to
complete
the
merger
without
the
votes
of
any
minority
shareholders.
these
alleged
misleading
passages
in
the
proxy
statement
were
held
to
be
the
cause
of
those
millions
of
dollars
in
damages.
it
is
no
coincidence
that
plaintiffs
have
used
these
rulings
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
obtain
indirectly
the
appraisal
remedy
which
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
has
determined
should
not
be
available
in
bank
merger
cases
of
this
kind.
i'd
like
to
mention
at
the
outset
an
important
point
of
agreement
between
ourselves
and
the
sec,
something
which
is
a
rarity
in
securities
litigation
before
this
court.
i
can't
think
of
another
case
in
which
the
sec
has
told
this
court
that
a
judgment
in
favor
of
securities
law
plaintiffs
was,
quote,
"in
error".
but
that
is
what
the
sec
has
advised
the
court
here,
and
on
this
point
the
sec
is
surely
right.
in
simple
terms,
the
jury
never
found
that
the
millions
of
dollars
in
damages
that
were
awarded
here
were
in
any
way
caused
or
brought
about
by
the
alleged
defects
in
the
proxy
statement.
and
that
is
because
of
the
jury
charge.
the
jury
charge
described
the
requirement
of
causation,
but
it
then
proceeded
to
instruct
the
jury
that
causation
was,
quote,
"sufficiently
shown"
if
the
allegedly
misleading
proxy
statement
was
an
essential
link
in
the
transaction,
that
is
if
it
was
necessary
under
state
law
for
the
defendants
to
solicit
proxies.
the
jury
also
was
instructed
that
it
was
no
defense
that
the
votes
of
the
minority
shareholders
were
not
needed
to
approve
the
transaction.
now
the
sec
has
explained
why
these
causation
instructions
are
erroneous.
there
is
no
basis
for
finding
that
millions
of
dollars
in
damages
have
been
caused
simply
because
the
challenged
proxy
statement
was
required
by
state
law.
in
a
case
like
mills
against
electric
auto-lite,
where
the
plaintiff
shareholders
had
enough
votes
to
make
a
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
shareholder
election,
a
materially
misleading
proxy
statement
disseminated
to
all
of
the
shareholders
logically
supported
a
finding
of
causation.
but
in
this
case
any
alleged
errors
in
the
proxy
statement
were
completely
irrelevant
to
the
outcome
of
the
shareholders'
vote--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--a
vote
which
was
never
in
doubt.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
and
of
course
the
court
left
open
the
question
of
whether
causation
could
be
shown
in
a
situation
where
the
minority
shareholders
had
no
voting
power.
and
that,
of
course,
is
this
case
which
is
before
the
court
today.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
arguable
at
least,
but
i...
now
that
the
sec,
i
believe,
has
sided
with
us
on
this
proposition,
i...
as
i
understand
my
brother's
arguments,
they--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
may
be
appellate
counsel's
view
of
it,
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
still
correct.
[laughter]
notice
my
brother
has
attempted
to
jettison
this
essential
link
theory
that
he
relied
on
exclusively
in
the
courts
below,
and
in
this
court
he
is
now
arguing
for
the
first
time
that
actual
causation
was
established
here
because
the
minority
shareholder
votes
were
necessary
under
a
conflict
of
interest
statute
that's
on
the
books
in
the
state
of
virginia.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
those
theories
were
not
argued
to
the
jury,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
critical
point.
no
such
causation
claim
was
ever
presented
to
the
jury,
to
the
district
court,
or
to
the
court
of
appeals.
this
is
an
after
thought
that
has
been
raised
in
an
attempt
to
buttress
this
judgment.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
your
honor,
you're
correct.
what
they
have
said
is
that
the
instructions
here
are
not
defensible,
and
that
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
error.
now
this
afterthought
that
plaintiffs
have
offered
to
defend
the
rulings
below,
after
they
set
aside
the
essential
link
theory,
in
addition
to
being
a
point
that
wasn't
raised
below,
is
a
hopelessly
speculative
theory.
although
plaintiffs
are
now
arguing
in
this
court
that
they
could
have
set
aside
this
merger
under
virginia
conflict
of
interest
law,
they
haven't
cited
a
single
virginia
authority
that
suggests
that
this
is
so,
that
a
minority
shareholder
could
upset
a
merger
in
this
situation.
and
there
is
actual
litigation
experience
in
virginia
that
directly
refutes
their
theory.
in
state
court,
plaintiffs
alleged
that
the
majority
shareholder
dominated
the
bank
and
had
an
interlocking
director
with
a
conflict
of
interest.
but
they
were
denied
an
injunction
or
an
appraisal
on
two
separate
occasions,
and
the
state
supreme
court
denied
review.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
a
proper
instruction,
your
honor,
would
direct
the
jury
to
consider
the
issue
of
proximate
cause
and
cause
in
fact
without
telling
the
jury
that
causation
is
established
simply
because
there
is
an
essential
link.
that
was
the
mistake
here,
giving
that
preemptive
instruction
that
told
the
jury
that
causation
was
established
simply
if
the
proxy
solicitation
was
required.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
they
take
the
position
that
if
there
has
been
a
commitment
by
the
majority
shareholder
to
abide
by
a
vote
of
a
majority
of
the
minority
shareholders,
then
you
would
arguably
have
mills
causation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
the
position
that
they
have
taken.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
think
that
those
issues
need
not
be
reached
here,
because
causation
wasn't
decided--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--of
course.
your
honor,
we
do
disagree
with
these
broad
theories
that
are
referred
to
as
sue-fact
theories
or
shame-fact
theories.
we
think
that
in
addition
to
being
not
presented
here,
that
they
are
far
removed
from
congress'
concern
in
passing
section
14(a),
and
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
this
court's
implied
right
of
action
decisions
don't
encompass
extraneous
injuries
of
that
sort,
that
are
far
removed
from
congress'
core
concern.
but
you
need
not
agree
with
us--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--in
this
instance
the
sec
is
right.
it
didn't
have
to
be
circulated.
it
was
circulated
because
corporate
counsel
believed
that,
at
this
annual
meeting
where
directors
were
being
elected,
that
proxy
should
be
solicited
under
virginia
law.
but
it
wasn't
necessary
to
approve
the
merger.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
was
a
permissible
act
under
virginia
law,
but
it
wasn't
required
under
virginia
law.
but
the
sec
is
absolutely
right
about
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that
strikes
us
on
a
record
of
this
kind
as
being
utterly
speculative.
the
majority
here
made
clear
that
it
intended
to
go
ahead
with
the
merger
and
exercise
its
statutory
rights
under
virginia
law.
there
may
be
other
cases
where
the
majority
has
committed
itself
in
the
merger
agreement
to
abide
by
the
vote
of
the
minority.
now
that
would
present
a
different
case,
and
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
sec
about
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
none
of
this
was
developed.
no
such
causation
theory
was
ever
presented
to
the
jury.
but
the
reason
i
say
that
that
is
impermissibly
speculative,
even
if
it
had
been
presented,
is
that
we
know
to
a
certainty
that
the
majority
shareholder
did
not
blink.
it
went
ahead
with
this
transaction
despite
all
of
the
accusations,
despite
the
litigation,
the
onslaught
of
protest.
we
know
to
a
factual
certainty
that
the
majority
shareholder
was
determined
to
exercise
its
statutory
rights
here.
now
it...
even
if
this
court
in
some
future
case
may
take
an
interest
and
resolve
favorably
to
the
sec
some
of
these
expansive
causation
theories
that
we
have
been
discussing,
it's
important
to
emphasize
that,
as
the
sec
recognizes
here,
causation
wasn't
found
in
this
case
on
any
of
these
theories.
and
even
in
this
court
it
is
quite
telling
that
no
causation
theory
is
asserted
on
this
record
that
is
anything
more
than
sheer
speculation.
as
i
previously
mentioned,
these
plaintiffs
were
totally
unable
to
block
this
merger
in
state
court
or
in
the
state
supreme
court.
and
although
they
say
that
the
majority
shareholder
might
have
abandoned
this
merger
under
an
onslaught
of
pressure
from
the
minority,
they
don't
cite
any
evidence
in
support
of
that
either.
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
kennedy,
despite
vehement
protest
before
the
state
corporation
commission,
before
the
state
courts,
before
the
federal
courts,
the
majority
shareholder
here
has
insisted
on
its
statutory
rights.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
justice.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
objected
to
the
essential
links
construction,
and
we
did
tender
our
own
proximate
cause
instruction.
yes,
we
did
object.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
we
tendered
our
own,
we
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
this
ground.
we
reincorporated
our
summary
judgment
papers
at
the
directed
verdict
stage.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
it
is.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
it's
the
proximate
cause
instruction.
and
of
course
we
saw
jnov
on
this
very
line
of
argument
after
trial.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
it
improperly
presumes
causation
simply
because
a
proxy
statement
was
alleged
to
be
required
under
state
law.
and
our
view
is
that
you
can't
simply
assume
that
millions
of
dollars
in
damages
have
been
caused
because
state
law
may
require--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--or
even
$5.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
under
the
proximate
cause
instruction,
without
this
preemptive
instruction
the
trial
court
gave
that
literally
removed
the
causation
issue
from
the
jury's
domain.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
do,
your
honor.
but
we
think
as
a
matter
of...
under
correct
instructions
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
tendered
a
proximate
cause
instruction.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
said
that
the
violation
has
to
be
a
substantial
factor
and
a
direct
cause
of
the
injury
alleged
by
the
plaintiffs.
and
of
course
we
sought
summary
judgment
and
directed
verdict
that
would
have
removed
this
from
the
jury's
domain,
but
we
also,
assuming
that
the
judge
had
tendered--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is,
your
honor.
and
we--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
sought
directed
verdict
and
summary
judgment
on
that
very
ground,
and
when
the
trial
court
insisted
on
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury
we
then
submitted,
of
course,
that
instruction.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
before
leaving
this
interesting
issue
of
causation,
i
should
mention
briefly
one
additional
defect
in
plaintiffs'
new
causation
theories,
and
justice
o'connor
has
adverted
to
this
already.
that
is,
these
theories
really
have
no
relationship
at
all
to
congress'
purpose
in
enacting
section
14(a).
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
exactly
right.
one
can
read
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
again
and
again
without
finding
the
slightest
suggestion
that
congress
meant
federal
proxy
regulation
to
be
used
as
a
device
to
facilitate
state
court
litigation,
as
my
brother
has
argued,
or
to
serve
any
purpose
other
than
implementing
the
actual
voting
rights
of
shareholders.
in
these
circumstances
we
submit
that
an
award
of
damages
is
simply
unnecessary
to
achieve
any
of
congress'
purposes
in
enacting
this
provision.
now--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
a
correct--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
where
there
is
no
allegation
of
voting
rights
injury,
then
as
a
matter
of
law
the
case
should
be
dismissed
or
summary
judgment
granted.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
there's
a
material
misstatement
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
on
this
fallback
point
we
argue
not
only
was
it
not
presented
to
the
jury,
but
in
addition
it
couldn't
have
been
presented
to
the
jury
because
there
is
no
nonspeculative,
nonvoting
causation
theory
that
has
been
argued
in
this
case.
this
causation
theory
is
a
sufficient
ground
for
reversal
here,
but
there
is
an
additional
ground,
of
course.
the
two
claims
of
misrepresentation
that
are
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
are
both
defective,
we
submit,
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
misrepresentation
issue.
the
first
claim
of
misrepresentation
is
that
the
proxy
statement
falsely
describes--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--in
a
case
like
this
it
wasn't
necessary
under
state
law.
it
was
simply
a
piece
of
information,
such
as
an
annual
report,
given
to
the
shareholders.
it
wasn't
a
required
document.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
it
serves
a
general
informative
purpose,
but
it
doesn't
serve
the
purpose--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
section
14(a)
is
aimed
at.
now,
the
first
claim
of
misrepresentation
is
that
this
proxy
statement
falsely
reported
that
the
directors
approved
this
merger
because
they
believed
that
the
buyout
price
was
a
high
price.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
jury
might
find
that
the
directors
were
not
really
motivated
by
this
$10
premium,
30
percent
premium
over
prior
market
price,
and
it
claimed
that
they
may
have
been
secretly
motivated
by
a
desire
to
retain
their
seats
on
the
board
of
directors.
this
claim
illustrates
as
clearly
as
possible
the
need
for
judicial
supervision
of
speculative
securities
fraud
claims,
which
depend
not
on
objective
and
verifiable
facts,
but
rather
on
excursions
into
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
a
multi-member
board
of
directors.
we
have
here
a
22-member
board
of
directors,
including
the
president
of
george
mason
university,
a
former
distinguished
congressman,
local
government
officials,
securities
professionals,
an
accountant,
lawyers,
and
a
group
of
businessmen.
these
directors
met
on
four
occasions
over
a
month's
period
of
time
to
discuss
the
buy-out,
and
they
questioned
the
investment
banker
for
over
2
hours
on
the
issue
of
fair
price.
there
are
contemporaneous
meeting
notes
which
show
that
the
directors
focused
on
"the
high
premium,
30
percent.
"
that's
joint
appendix
page
455.
there
is
simply
no
rational
objective
basis
for
inferring
that
these
directors
didn't
really
believe
that
this
$10
premium
was
a
high
price.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
are
presenting
these
as
alternative
points,
your
honor.
there
is
a
line
of
cases--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--what
the
cases
have
said,
your
honor,
is
if
there
is
indeed
objective
support
for
a
claim
of
insincerity,
that's
another
matter.
but
when
it
is
merely
a
speculative
hypothesis--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
the
courts
have
uniformly
refused
to
tender
these
claims
to
juries.
even
the
cases
the
plaintiffs
cite,
the
berg
case
in
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
danger,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--unless
there
is
an
objectively
verifiable
basis
for
that
assertion
of
securities
fraud.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
there
is
a
document,
if
there
is
testimonial
evidence.
but
here
it
is
simply
an
excursion
into
the
state
of
mind
of
these
22
individuals.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
[laughter]
i
don't
at
all.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
would
be
enough
evidence.
the
cases
recognize
that
if
you
do
have
direct
evidence
of
insincerity,
then
a
case
of
this
sort
could
go
to
a
jury.
but
here--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--this
is
close
to
being
the
normal
rule,
but
with
special
emphasis
on
the
blue
chip
stamps
policy
analysis
of
the
dangers
of
vexatious
litigation
in
this
category
of
case,
where
the
court
has
been
particularly
cautious
about
speculative
inferences
on
subjective
issues.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
think
under
a
correct
application
of
the
common
law
rule,
or
the
antitrust
rule
in
matsushida,
that
speculative
inferences
are
forbidden
across
the
board.
it
is
just
there
is
a
special
need
for
that
kind
of
judicial
scrutiny
which
was
not
given--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
traditional
rule,
the
same
rule,
your
honor,
that
the
court
applies
in
the
antitrust
proceedings,
and
indeed
in
the
galloway
case
the
plaintiff
cited.
the
rule
against
speculation,
where
there
is
no
objectively
demonstrable
basis
for
inferring
insincerity.
now
here--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
one
matter,
your
honor,
when
you
are
talking
about
the
state
of
mind
of
an
individual
broker
or
an
accountant,
but
we
are
talking
about
a
22-member
board
of
directors
here.
you
are
alleging
that
they
are
insincere
in
stating
that
a
price
is
a
fair
price.
then
you
are
truly
entering
into
the
domain
of
psychoanalysis
and
not
into
inferences
of
fact.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
is
an
additional
reason
for
caution,
as
the
courts
have
held.
and
i
think
this
is
right.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
board
is,
here
it
was
signed
by
the
chief
executive
officer
and
the
chairman
of
the
board,
who
was
responsible
for
it,
yes.
and
the
claim
is
that
the
board,
22
members,
didn't
sincerely
believe
that
this
was
a
high
price.
and
our
proposition
is
that
there
is
no
objective
foundation
for
that
assertion.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
unhappily
for
that
theory,
this
is
the
reason
that
was
given
in
the
board
room.
this
was
the
reason
that
was
discussed--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
lower
courts--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
completely
subjective,
your
honor.
there
is
no
objective
evidence
that
these
people
didn't
believe--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--often
there
is
an
objective
memorial
of
reasons.
here
there
was,
in
fact,
a
memorandum
prepared
by
the
general
counsel
which
said
that
they
did
focus
on
the
high
premium,
30
percent.
they
all
testified
that
that
was
their
conviction
and
their
basis
for
making
this
decision.
now,
it's
important
in
assessing
this
claim
to
keep
in
mind
that
now
the
sec
requires
directors
to
state
their
opinion
on
the
issue
of
fairness
in
every
merger
of
this
kind.
and
if
claims
of
director
insincerity
or
ulterior
motivation
could
be
brought
into
federal
court
without
the
kind
of
objective
supporting
evidence
that
i'm
talking
about,
every
state
appraisal
grievance
would
be
brought
into
federal
court
in
disregard
of
this
court's
decision
in
green
v.
santa
fe,
and
in
disregard
of
the
principles
that
this
court
articulated
in
blue
chip
stamps.
the
court
warned
in
blue
chip
stamps
against
conjectural
and
speculative
inquiries
into
subjective
issues,
as
opposed
to,
quote,
"objectively
demonstrable
fact".
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
as
i
have
mentioned,
consistently
have
held...
there
isn't
a
single
case
that
we
were
able
to
find
where
a
claim
like
this
of
director
insincerity
that
didn't
have
specific
supporting
objective
evidence
was
permitted
to
go
to
a
jury.
if
the
court
affirms
here,
this
will
be
the
first
case,
and
it
will
truly
open
up
a
pandora's
box
where
appraisal
remedies
are
brought
into
federal
court
simply
by
pleading
that
they
didn't
really
believe,
or
they
didn't
sincerely
believe
that
this
price
was
high.
that
would
overrule
green
v.
santa
fe
effectively
and
truly
burden
the
federal
courts
with
an
outpouring
of
new,
and
i
believe
vexatious,
litigation.
now,
the
last
claim
of
misrepresentation
is,
i
must
say,
almost
impossible
for
me
to
understand.
the
sin
here
apparently
was
that
the
proxy
statement
described
one
of
the
nation's
top
investment
banking
firms
as
being
independent,
and
said
that
it
passed
on
financial
fairness.
well,
it
was
independent.
it
was
an
outside,
unaffiliated,
autonomous
investment
banking
firm.
and
as
the
sec
explains
in
its
brief,
liability
cannot
be
predicated
on
the
theory
that
it
wasn't
independent.
and
in
addition,
this
investment
banker
did
pass
on
financial
fairness.
it
reviewed
a
variety
of
financial
data,
and
it
applied
a
variety
of
analytical
techniques.
and
of
course
at
the
end
of
the
process
it
issued
an
opinion
on
the
issue
of
financial
fairness.
now,
plaintiffs
may
disagree
with
that
opinion,
and
plaintiffs
may
dislike
its
methodology,
but
they
can't
deny
that
this
opinion
was
actually
rendered
on
the
issue
of
financial
fairness.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
they
originated
the
$42
price.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
investment
banking
firm
did.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
opponent
doesn't
agree
with
that.
our
point
is,
your
honor,
that
the
proxy
statement
made
no
representation
about
who
originated--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
quite
right.
if
the
court
please,
we
would
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
a
similar
instruction
was
submitted
by
the
other
group
of
defendants.
the
important
point
here,
your
honor,
is
that
we
denied
that
there
was
an
essential
link
under
mills,
that...
in
other
words,
we
weren't
conceding
that
the
essential
link
standard
had
been
satisfied
here
in
the
mills
sense,
because
our
view
was
that
before
you
have
an
essential
link
there
has
to
be
voting
power
in
the
minority
shareholders.
so
there
was
nothing--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
did
indeed.
we
objected
in
writing.
both
defendants
objected
in
writing
specifically
on
the
mills
point,
and
in
addition
we
objected
orally--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--absolutely,
your
honor.
both
defendants,
in
writing,
and
then
orally--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--this
is
cited
on
page
9
of,
excuse
me,
page
3
of
our
reply
brief,
the
yellow
reply
brief
at
the
top,
where
we
cite
to
the
places
where
we
objected
to
that
instruction.
and
we
did
it
in
written
obstructions...
instructions
in
the
district
court.
there
was
an
oral
objection
saying
that
this
misconceives
the
mills
footnote
7
issue.
that
was
an
objection
made
orally
by
one
group
of
defendants,
but
the
district
court
had
previously
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
repeat
objections,
that
they'll
be
deemed
to
be
made
by
both.
we
previously
had
filed
a
summary
judgment
brief
which
argued
extensively
that
there
was
no
causation
in
this
case
under
the
mills
standard.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
did
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
did.
there
were
two
separate
issues
on
appeal.
issues
1
and
3.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
questions
1
and
3,
you
will
see
that
there
is
a
reliance
question
and
then
there
is
a
causation
question.
they
are
argued
in
separate
portions
of
the
brief,
reliance
and
causation.
they
are
of
course
related
points,
but
they
are
distinct
and
they
were
presented
distinctly
in
the
court
of
appeals
here.
there
isn't
any
serious
argument
of
waiver
in
this
situation.
we
also
raised
the
same
arguments
in
our
post-trial
motions
at
some
length
when
we
saw
jnov,
and
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
question.
so
it's
ripe
for
this
court's
decision.
now,
the
argument
was
made
that
the
defendants
here
had
conceded
that
it
is
somehow
necessary
to
go
to
the
shareholders
and
get
shareholder
approval.
if
you
look
at
that
quotation
in
the
appendix,
all
that
it
says
is
that
it
is
necessary
under
state
law
to
get
two-thirds
of
the
votes
of
the
shareholders.
a
two-third
vote
is
necessary
to
approve
this
transaction.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
majority
here
thought
that
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
the
minority
shareholders
with
hat
in
hand
and
ask
for
their
permission.
they
had
statutory
rights
here
to
proceed
with
this
merger.
now,
the
argument
was
also
made
that
we
had
presented
to
the
jury
the
conflict
of
interest
statute,
and
that
indeed
we
tendered
that
causation
theory
to
the
jury
ourselves
by
citing
that
statute.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
causation
issue.
that
statute
is
a
safe
harbor.
it
merely
says
that
mergers
such
as
this
cannot
be
challenged
in
state
court
if
one
of
three
criteria
are
satisfied.
and
we
merely
pointed
out
that
the
individual
directors
who
were
sued
under
state
law
couldn't
be
attacked
because
of
that
safe
harbor.
the
idea
that
this
was
somehow
presented
to
the
jury
as
a
causation
theory
is
fantastic.
it
was
never
presented
to
the
jury
in
any
such
guise.
if
the
court
please,
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that
would
conclude
our
argument.
