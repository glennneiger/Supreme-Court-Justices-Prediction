we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1448,
virginia
bankshares
v.
doris
i.
sandberg.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
what
was
your
objection
to
the...
was
and
is
your
objection
to
the
so-called
essential
link
instruction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
even
$5.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
it
should
be
left
as
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
once
more,
mr.
shapiro,
about
the
instruction.
you
really
have
two
objections
to
the
causation,
to
the
essential
link?
one
is
that
it
is
not
a
proper
statement
of
the
law
because
it
takes
something
away
from
the
jury
generally.
and
the
second
is,
in
your
case
you
don't
think
that
issue
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
common
law,
though,
is
full
of
what
you
call
excursions
into
people's
minds
when
you
are
dealing
with
fraud.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
although
they
could
have
entered
into
this
what
you
regard
as
speculative
if
they
were
talking
only
about
one
person,
they
can't
do
it
the
same
way
if
you
are
talking
about
a
multi-member
board?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
hassett.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
it
a
brief
on
a
question...
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
have
shifted
a
little
bit,
haven't
we,
mr.
hassett?
we
started
out
talking
about
instructions
on
causation,
and
now
we
are
talking
about
instruction
on
reliance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about,
at
the
risk
of
repetition
but
this
seems
to
be
fairly
critical,
this
last
sentence
on
page
426
in
the
paragraph
where
it
says
"sandberg
has
made
a
sufficient
showing
of
a
causal
relation
between
the
violation
and
the
injury
for
which
she
seeks
redress
if
she
proves
that
the
proxy
solicitation
itself
rather
than
a
particular
defect
in
the
solicitation
was
an
essential
link.
"
now,
that
does
take
an
element
of
causation
away
from
the
jury.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and...
but...
and
you
say
there
was
no
objection
by
the...
or
there
was
objection
by
bankshares
to
the
thing
i
just
read?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
we
don't
encourage
a
finding
of
mootness.
we
took
this
case
to
decide
certainly
questions
of
national
importance,
and
we're
not
looking
for
a
way
to
find
it
moot.
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
time...
you're
using
the
sec's
time.
there's
no
law
against
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
maybe
the
sec
would
be
the
best
person
to
say
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1448
virginia
bankshares
versus
sandberg
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
