mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honor,
if
i
may,
first
let
me
clear
up
a
couple
of
points.
one,
counsel
says
this
morning
that
the
reason
the
bank
engaged
in
the
solicitation
was
a
mistake.
but
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
jury
that
that
was
the
reason
for
the
solicitation.
in
fact,
as
recently
as
the
reply
brief,
on
page
4
at
note
5,
the
petitioners
were
representing
that
the
reason
for
the
solicitation
was
that
state
law
in
fact
required
it.
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
as
to
the
reason
for
the
solicitation
before
the
jury.
we've
summarized
it
in
our
brief,
and
i
don't
want
to
dwell
on
it
here,
but
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
as
to
the
reason...
the
reasons
that
have
been
adverted
to
in
some
of
the
questions.
and
in
any
event,
petitioners
made
no
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
on
grounds
it
lacked
sufficient
proof
to
prove
causation.
now
also,
counsel
now
says
that
the
petitioners
did
tender
a
different
instruction
of
their
own
on
causation,
and
that
they
did
object
to
the
pertinent
causation
instructions.
but
that
is
not
so.
the
proximate
cause
instruction
that
counsel
refers
to
was
one
that
was
tendered
by
both
sides,
and
one
that
judge
bryan
gave
at
the
trial.
petitioners,
at
page
81
and
82
and
page
92
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
see
where
petitioners
submitted
their
own
instruction
to
the
jury,
telling
judge
bryan
here
is
how
it
should
be
instructed.
and
that
instruction
provides
that
if
the
jury
finds
that
the...
it
was
phrased
in
this
way:
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
prove
reliance
if
she
proves
that
the
proxy
solicitation
was
an
essential
link
in
accomplishing
the
transaction.
and
so,
your
honor,
the
very
instruction
that
petitioners
say
now
was
error
is
exactly
the
instruction
that
they
asked
judge
bryan--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--well,
your
honor,
both...
there
are
two--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--i
believe
no,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
why.
there
were
two
sets
of
separately
represented
parties
in
the
district
court.
one
were
the
directors.
the
directors
don't
claim
to
have
made
any
such
motion.
the
other
separately
represented
party
was
bankshares,
the
holding
company.
they
say,
and
it's
at
around
page
79,
i
think,
of
the
appendix,
but
it's
in
the
appendix,
they
say
that
an
argument
that
they
made
there
in
two
pages
of
a
long,
long
brief
constituted
raising
this
essential
link
transaction.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
and,
but
the
argument
heading
is
that
the
plaintiff
can't
recover
because
there
was
no
reliance.
and
there
is
a
reference
to
mills
footnote
7
in
the
argument,
but
there
is...
the
argument
is
that
there
was
no
reliance.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
no,
your
honor,
they
didn't.
there
was
not
one
word
about
it,
and
they
don't
contest
the
representation
in
our
brief
that
there
was
not
one
word
about
it
in
their
fore
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
never
even
cited--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
they
conceded
that
the
correct
instructions
on
which
the
case
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
was
that
the
test
was
essential
link.
it's
exactly
the
instruction
they
asked
for.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
well,
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
the
instruction
that
judge
bryan
gave,
and
it
appears
at
page
424
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
other
instruction
to
which
you
refer,
which
is
at
426,
is
one
that
begins
with
it
is
not
necessary
for
plaintiff
to
establish
a
separate
showing
of
reliance
if
she
shows
it's
an
essential
link.
and
this,
having
these
two
instructions
grew
out
of
the
fact
that
the
only
contention
that
petitioners
were
making
in
the
trial
court
in
this
regard
was
the
contention
that
plaintiff
was
barred
because
she
didn't
rely
on
the
proxy
statement.
and
in
connection
with
that,
both
parties
proposed
an
instruction...
theirs
i
just
referred
to
in
81-82
and
92,
reliance
needn't
be
shown
if
it
was
an
essential
link,
and
we
proposed
one,
and
judge
bryan
gave
one,
that
said
you
don't
have
to
show
reliance
if
there
is
an
essential
link.
now,
it's
quite
true
that
in
the
course
of
giving
that
judge
bryan
also
said
that
if
you
find
it
was
an
essential
link,
if
you
find
it
was
necessary
to
solicit
proxies
from
minority
stockholders--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
two
concepts
of
course
get
murkily
involved
with
each
other.
but
i
think
that
the
instructions
given
were
quite
correct.
that
number
one,
the
jury
had
to
find
that
petitioners'
conduct
with
respect
to
the
proxy
solicitation...
under
the
proximate
cause
they
are
required
to
find
that
that
conduct
caused
our
injury,
caused
the
respondents'
injury.
in
the
no
reliance
necessary,
the
instruction
says
no
reliance
is
necessary
if
the
proxy
solicitation
was
an
essential
link.
and
that
of
course
is
exactly
what
the
court
held
in
mills.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
he
instructed
them
in
the
instruction
at
426,
your
honor,
that
if
they
found
it
was
necessary
to
solicit
proxies
from
minority
stockholders,
they
may
find
that
it
was
an
essential
link.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
well,
the
evidence...
there
was
evidence
in
two
regards
before
the
jury,
your
honor.
first
was
the
evidence
that...
and
petitioners
admitted
before
the
jury,
that
the
participation
of
the
holding
company
director
on
the
board
of
the
subsidiary
bank
created
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
and
petitioners
themselves
asked
the
jury
to
find
that
approval
of
the
merger
by
the
minority
stockholders--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--the
other
reason
was
that
there
was
evidence
that
the
holding
company
had
decided
and
had
represented
to
the
bank
that
in
order
to
avoid
the
adverse
consequences
of
forcing
this
down
upon
the
minority
stockholders
against
their
will,
that...
and
the
testimony
was,
i
think
at
page
202
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
chairman
of
the
bank
testified
that
the
representation
was
made
to
him
by
the
holding
company
that
before
this
could
happen,
this
acquisition
of
the
minority
stock
by
the
holding
company,
the
board
of
the
bank
would
have
to
approve
it,
and
the
chairman
of
the
bank
testified
that
we
would
have
to
go
to
the
stockholders
for
their
approval
as
well.
and
it's
our
contention,
your
honor,
that
that
representation,
in
conjunction
with
the
many
representations
and
all
the
emphasis
by
the
petitioners
before
the
jury,
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
that
whole...
the
confusion
there
is
something
of
the
petitioners'
own
making.
that
is
not
a
contention
that
we've
made.
the
evidence
was
there
before
the
jury
as
to
why
it
was
necessary,
and
that...
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
under
instructions
that--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--that
i
summarized,
and
it
is
set
out
in
a
little
more
detail
in
the
brief.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
i
think,
your
honor,
does
it
go
on
and
say
you
must
find
it's
a
material
misstatement,
and
that
the
solicitation
was
an
essential
link?
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
yes,
your
honor.
in
all
other
respects
i
believe
the
sec's
reasoning
is
brilliant
and
sound
and--
[laughter]
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
as
to
this...
well,
as
to
this,
your
honor,
actually
what
i
think
is
that
because
of
the
peculiar
way
that
this
case
developed,
where
none
of
these
arguments
were
made
in
the
district
court,
and
it
is
undeniable
that
there
was...
that
petitioners,
who
were
the
appellants
in
the
court
of
appeals,
said
nothing
about
it
in
their
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--the
petitioners,
your
honor...
there
is
three
paragraphs...
there's
two
different
instructions
at
424.
the
directors
made
no
objection
to
either
of
them.
the
holding
company
made
an
objection
to
the
first
but
not
the
second.
and
the
second
is
one
that
says
it
is
no
defense
that
they...
that
the
holding
company
had
enough
votes--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--the...
there's
two...
on
page
426,
the
way
that--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--yes.
starting
at
"it
is
not
necessary"--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--the
next
two
paragraphs,
your
honor,
were
one
instruction.
the
parties
knew
it
as
29.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
the
directors
did
not
object
to
29.
the
bankshares,
the
holding
company,
did.
the
next
sentence,
the
next
paragraph,
"if
you
find",
et
cetera,
it
says
there...
no
defense
that
they
had
enough
votes
to
approve
it
themselves.
it
was
not
objected
to
by
either
petitioner.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
yes,
your
honor,
provided
that
in
the
next...
you
have
to
read
it
in
conjunction,
we
submit,
your
honor,
with
the
next
paragraph,
which
defines
essential
link.
and
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
needs
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
proximate
cause
instruction.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
there
was
by
bankshares,
your
honor,
but
not
to
the
directors.
each
group
were
separately
represented,
they
each
submitted
their
own
objections.
in
the
reply
they
argue,
in
an
effort
to
save
the
directors,
they
say
that
something
judge
bryan
said
on
the
first
morning
of
the
trial,
which
is
at
ja
132,
saves
the
directors.
during
the
examination
on
the
first
morning
of
a
witness,
judge
bryan
said
he
would
assume
that
the
two
separately
represented
groups
joined
in
each
others'
objections
unless
they
said
otherwise.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
your
honor,
the
evidence--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--no.
your
honor,
the
way
we
read
that
instruction
is
it
says
that
it
was
necessary
to
solicit
proxies
from
minority
stockholders.
and
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
nobody
was
suggesting
in
the
district
court
that
there
was
some
state
law
requirement,
and
of
course
there
isn't,
that
requires--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--our
view,
your
honor,
was
that
it
was
necessary
to
solicit
from
minority
stockholders
because
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
their
votes.
and
the
reason
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
their
votes
is
that
without
them
the
merger
was
voidable
because
of
the
conflict
of
interest,
and
because
without
them
the
condition
that
the
chairman
of
the
bank
testified
to,
minority
stockholder
approval
was
not
satisfied.
and
there
was
no
motion
made
that
our
evidence
was
insufficient
to
prove
that.
it
went
to
the
jury
on
that
basis.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
no,
your
honor,
there
was
no...
there
was
no
argument...
there
was
no
evidence
by
the
other
side
that
questioned
the
necessity
of
soliciting
them
to
get
this
approval.
the
petitioners
in
the
trial
court--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--yes,
your
honor,
because
we
proved
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest,
which
they
admitted
before
the
jury.
and
that's
at
page--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--no,
your
honor.
there
was
no...
1093-94
of
the
court
of
appeals'
joint
appendix,
they
admitted
the
conflict.
but
they,
your
honor,
asked
the
jury
to
find,
and
judge
bryan
gave
the
instruction
that
they
asked
for,
that
the
conflict
in
the
board
that
they
admitted
existed
would
be
cured
if
the
jury
in
this
very
case
found
that
the
minority
stockholders
had
given
their
approval
to
this
transaction.
so
it,
they
brought
home
to
the
jury
in
the
most
graphic
kind
of
a
way
that
the
reason
they
solicited
minority
stockholder
approval
was
not
because
they
made
some
mistake
on
this
important
transaction,
where
they
say
that
$13
million
is
involved,
which
i
may
say
is
$13
million
under
the
jury's
finding
that
the
value
of
the
stock
that
belonged
to
the
minority
stockholders
and
which
petitioner
has
unjustly--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--but
your
honor,
the
question,
i
think
there
are
underlying
facts,
of
course,
that
have
to
be
found
to
present
that
question
of
law.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
well,
i
think
that
there's
another
fact
there
which
is
was
the
board
so
much
of
a
rubber
stamp,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
was
on
another
aspect
of
the
case
not
submitted,
but
that
the
board
couldn't
cure
the
conflict.
the
court
of
appeals
held,
and
it
is
not
being
reviewed,
that
this
board
exercised
no
judgment
independently
whatever
with
respect
to
the
merger,
but
rubber-stamped
everything
put
in
front
of
it.
and
the
jury,
having
that
evidence
and
having
before
it
that
the--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--no,
there
was
no
instruction
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
there
was
this
instruction.
and
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
if
this
instruction
was
too
broad,
then
the
obligation
was
on
the
petitioners
to
object--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
i
do
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
that
is
absolutely
our
position,
your
honor.
there
was
one
objection
made
to
that
instruction,
and
that
objection
was
by
bankshares
only,
and
it
said
that
this
instruction
wrongly
decides
the
issue
left
open--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
it
was
not
pressed
below.
the
directors--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
oh,
we
do,
your
honor.
they--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
the
directors
made
no
such
motion
of
any
kind.
and
the
bankshares,
as
i
say,
they
made
the
motion
that
appears
at...
i
don't
know,
page
50-something
i
think
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
oh,
yes,
they
are,
your
honor,
but
under--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--well,
except,
your
honor,
that
if
the
directors,
for
example,
are
barred
from
raising
it,
then
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
as
to
them.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
at
that
stage
i
would
say
as
to
bankshares
it
would
be
moot.
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
i
would
suggest
it
is
moot
if
it's
not
preserved
by
the
directors.
the
judgment
is
joint
and
several,
and
the
respondents
would
be
satisfied...
the
directors
are
being
indemnified
by
the
holding
company
anyway,
so
that--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
may
i
say
on
behalf
of--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
the
sec
is
asking
you
to
decide.
may
i
just
say
very
quickly
that--
mr.
joseph
m.
hassett
--i'll
just
say
very
quickly,
your
honor,
that
the
position
taken
by
the
sec
was
something
that
they
briefed
before
they
saw
the
brief
of
the
petitioners,
and
i
think
that
the
sec
was
saying
that
the
instruction
is
faulty
because--
mr.
joseph
