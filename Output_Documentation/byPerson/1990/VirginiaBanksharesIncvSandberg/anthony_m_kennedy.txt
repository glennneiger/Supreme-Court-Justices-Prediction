well,
in
the
mills
case--
justice
kennedy
--in
the
mills
case,
counsel,
we
said
that
causation
would
be
shown,
didn't
we,
if
the
defect
had
a
significant
propensity
to
mislead?
justice
kennedy
were
those
theories
argued
to
the
jury?
justice
kennedy
what
about
the
theory
that
the
bank
would
not
want
to
have
offended
its
minority
shareholders,
some
of
whom
were
customers,
and
that
the
same
thing
in
fact
had
happened
in
maryland?
was
all
this
developed
in
the
record
below
at
the
trial?
justice
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
their
claim
is
that
it's
not
sincerely
believed.
their
claim
is
that
this
was
not
the
basis
for
the
board
of
directors'
action.
the
board
of
directors
act
for
reasons,
and
their
discussion
is
that
this
was
not
the
reason
that
was
given
in
the
board
room.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
that's
a
question
of
fact.
you're
saying
that
this
cannot
be
actionable.
justice
kennedy
and
their
theory
is
that
the
board
acts
for
a
reason,
and
that
this
reason
was
not
the
reason
that
prompted
the
board
to
act.
it's
not
subjective.
justice
kennedy
well,
do
boards
of
directors
always
act
for
subjective
reasons?
they
never
give
a
stated
purpose
for
board
action?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
petitioners
say
that
what
he
gave
in
the
proximate
cause
instruction
he
later
took
away
by
saying
that
i
instruct
you
that
in
this
case
it
is
sufficient
if
it
was
an
essential
link.
in
other
words
he
takes
the
essential
link
as
a
way
to
define
compliance
with
the
causation
instruction.
justice
kennedy
--you
argued
that
to
the
jury?
justice
kennedy
did
you
put
in
evidence
that
it
was
necessary?
justice
kennedy
was
the
jury
advised
that
this
is
why
you
were
putting
that
evidence
in?
justice
kennedy
mr.
shapiro,
i
must
say
that
i
am
troubled
by
the
argument
that
the
instruction
that
was
submitted
by
the
defendants
at
page
91
of
the
joint
appendix
seems
to
track
very
closely
what
the
district
court
in
fact
instructed,
and
your...
the
submitted
instructions
break
causality
and
materiality
up
the
same
way.
did
all
defendants
submit
instruction
9?
