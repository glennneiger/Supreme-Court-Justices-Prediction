justice
o'connor
mr.
shapiro,
how
do
you
think
a
proper
instruction
on
causation
should
read?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
does
the
government,
the
solicitor
general,
take
the
position
of...
that
something...
that
for
instance,
if
the
practicalities
are
such
that
the
company
wants
to
get
a
favorable
vote
from
the
stockholders,
whether
or
not
they
have
the
power
to
stop
it,
that
that
could
be
causation?
justice
o'connor
of
if
for
some
reason
the
shareholders'
rights
under
state
law
would
be
affected.
justice
o'connor
and
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
disagree
with
that?
we
have
to
be
concerned
here
with
the
standard.
justice
o'connor
it
was
a
mistake
of
virginia
law
that
led
to
the
solicitation?
justice
o'connor
what
if
a
company
board
had
minority
stockholders
but
wanted
to
obtain
their
consent
nonetheless
to
a
merger
and
might
have
hesitated
to
go
ahead
with
the
merger
absent
that
consent?
justice
o'connor
mr.
hassett,
now
i
know
you
have
explained
this
already,
but
it's
not
clear
to
me.
the
instruction
that
was
given
did
tell
the
jury
that
it
is
enough
for
them
to
find
material
misstatements,
and
that
that
would
be
a
sufficient
showing
of
a
causal
relation?
that
is
the
instruction
on
page
426
of
the
joint
appendix.
justice
o'connor
was
an
essential
link.
that's
the
shorthand
in
mills.
justice
o'connor
now,
the
solicitor
general
takes
the
position
that
that's
not
enough,
that
that's
improper.
so
you...
the
sec
disagrees
with
you
on
this,
i
take
it?
justice
o'connor
but
on
this
point
they
are
not
so
brilliant?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
they
did
argue
below
that
the
instruction
of
causation
that
was
given
on
page
424
was
appropriate,
that
that
was
the
causation
instruction
that
ought
to
be
given.
justice
o'connor
was
an
objection
made
to
this
instruction
on
page
426
about
the
essential
link,
the
one
that
takes
away
the
causation
instruction?
justice
o'connor
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
where
is
that
in
the
record,
mr.
shapiro?
