justice
scalia
mr.
shapiro,
i
didn't
understand...
i
didn't
understand
the
sec
to
have
taken
the
position
in
this
case
that
there
can't
possibly
be
the
requisite
causality
if
the
votes
of
the
minority
shareholders
are
not
needed.
is
that
the
position
you
said
they
have
taken?
i...
they
have
taken
the
position
that
causality
was
not
established
here,
but
i
do
not
understand
them
to
have
taken
the
position
that
in
order
to
establish
causality
you
must
show
that
the
votes
of
the
minority
shareholders
were
needed.
justice
scalia
mr.
shapiro,
just
so
i
understand
what
your
position
is,
as
i
understand
it
you
think
these
cases
would
never
get
to
the
jury,
taking
your
pure
theory
that
when
minority
shareholder
approval
is
not
legally
needed,
there
is
no
cause
of
action.
it
would
be
always
a
question
of
law.
justice
scalia
the
court
would
look
at
it
and
see
whether
minority
shareholder
approval
is
needed.
if
it
is
needed,
then
under
mills
it
has
to
send
it.
if
it
isn't
needed,
then
under
your
assertion
it
can't
send
it
to
the
jury.
so
it's
always
going
to
be
a
question
of
law.
justice
scalia
and
when
there
is,
then
causation
is
automatically
established.
justice
scalia
right.
so
causation
is
out
of
the
case
on
your
pure
theory.
and
then
your
fallback
theory
is
even
if
that
isn't
right,
at
least
you
have
to
establish
genuine
causation
and
not
mere
necessity
of
going
through
a
state
procedure.
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
your
position
is
on
this.
i
mean,
i...
there
is
a
general
rule
of
common
law.
we
don't
need
some
special
sec
rule
that
if
there's
no
evidence
to
support
it,
of
course
the
court
has
to
throw
it
out.
but
what
is
it
that
you
require
beyond
this?
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
he
can
put
the
directors
on
the
stand,
and
they
admit
that
indeed
they
thought
that...
they
didn't
think
it
was
a
fair
price.
is
that
enough
evidence?
justice
scalia
well,
what
kind
of
evidence
is
not
direct
evidence,
that
would
satisfy
the
normal
rule
that
you
can't
let
it
go
to
the
jury
without
evidence,
but
will
not
satisfy
the
rule
you
are
urging
on
us?
justice
scalia
such
as
what?
give
me
an
example
of
evidence
that
would
not
suffice,
or
that
would
suffice
under
the
common
law
rule
and
would
not
suffice
under
what
you
urge
upon
us?
justice
scalia
is
that
all
you're
saying?
be
really
strict
about
applying...
be
careful
about
applying
the
common
law
rule
in
this
case?
justice
scalia
counsel,
you
referred
us
to
their
proposed
jury
charge
on
the
second
element,
namely
reliance
materiality.
but
they
also,
on
page
83
of
the
joint
appendix,
proposed
a
charge
on
the
fourth
element,
causation.
and
that
doesn't
just
say
essential
link.
it
says,
"in
order
to
satisfy
this
element,
plaintiff
need
not
prove
that
defendant's
conduct
was
the
only
cause
of
the
plaintiff's
injury.
"
"it
is
sufficient
if
you
find
that
the
accounts
of
defendants
were
a
substantial
and
significant
contributing
cause
to
the
injury
which
plaintiff
suffered.
"
that's
a
little
more
than
essential
link.
justice
scalia
mr.
hassett,
that's...
surely
it's
a
question
of
law
and
not
of
fact
whether
the
only
way
that
this
conflict
of
interest
could
be
cured
under
virginia
law
is
to
get
the
approval
of
the
minority
shareholders.
they
contest
that
that
is
the
case,
as
a
matter
of
virginia
law.
that's
not
a
question
for
the
jury.
that's
either
so
or
it's
not
so.
justice
scalia
like
what?
i
think
they
are
giving
you
the
conflict.
that
is
the
only
fact.
given
the
conflict,
do
you
need
the
votes
of
the
minority
shareholders
to
cure
it?
that's
a
question
of
law.
justice
scalia
and
the
jury
was
instructed
the
board
could
have
cured
it,
but
if
you
find
the
jury...
the
board
was
a
rubber
stamp,
it
couldn't?
justice
scalia
well,
now
wait,
but
that
wouldn't
dispose
of
the
case.
i
mean,
you
don't
contest
that
they
did
raise
the
objection
and
preserve
the
objection
as
to
whether
you...
there
is
any
right
of
action
if
you
in
fact,
even
with
the
vote
of
the
minority
shareholders,
could
not
have
prevented
the
merger?
justice
scalia
you
say
that
that
is
not
preserved
either?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
scalia
you
have
to
take
the
position
of
do
not
take
a
position,
because
you
really
did
say
in
your
brief
accordingly,
the
judgment,
to
the
extent
that
it
depends
on
the
validity
of
those
instructions,
cannot
stand.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
justice
scalia
nice,
mr.
dreeben.
[laughter]
now
what,
mr.
dreeben,
what
should
the
instruction
have
said
to
go
to
the
jury
on
causation?
justice
scalia
before
you
do
that...
i
know
you
have
been
trying
to
get
there,
but
also
of
importance
to
the
government
and
to
private
actions
is
whether
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
under
14(a)
for
any
effect,
any
causality,
unless
it
pertains
to
the
vote
for
which
the
proxy
was
solicited,
14(a)
having
been
adopted
when
the...
in
an
era
when
the
court
was
much
more
ready
to
find
implied
rights
of
action,
and
later
cases
cutting
back
on
that
readiness.
why
shouldn't
we
interpret
the
14(a)
private
right
of
action
as
narrowly
as
possible,
and
say
that
the
only
right
of
action
you
have
is
when
as
a
result
of
the
solicitation
you
have
been
misled,
either
you
or
other
minority
shareholders
who
could
have
stopped
the
merger
and
were
unable
to.
why
can't
we
dispose
of
the
case
on
that
basis?
justice
scalia
he
could
have
a
cause
of
action
under
state
law
for
misrepresentation,
i
assume.
justice
scalia
in
order
to
protect
voting
rights.
justice
scalia
and
if
they
voted
for
the
merger
they
couldn't...
they
didn't...
couldn't
have
an
appraisal.
justice
scalia
i
suppose,
but
if
i
think
the
private
right
of
action
shouldn't
have
been
created
in
the
first
place,
is
there
anything
that
would
be
illogical
in
my
saying
that
it,
having
been
created,
we
should
narrow
it
to...
it
having
been
wrongly
created,
without
overruling
prior
decisions,
we
should
narrow
it
simply
to
voting
rights?
