mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
materiality
aspect
of
the
case.
the
proxy
antifraud
rules
promulgated
under
the
federal
securities
laws
apply
to
false
or
misleading
statements
of
reason
or
characterization,
just
as
they
do
to
other
facts
set
forth
in
a
proxy
statement.
there
is
no
zone
of
immunity
under
the
proxy
rules
for
directors
who
misrepresent
such
matters.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens,
neither
the
sec
nor
the
fdic
has
taken
a
position
on
the
waiver
issue
in
this
case.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
instructions
that
were
given
were
not
adequate
to
capture
a
finding
of
causation
between
the
alleged
violation
and
the
injury.
but
we
have
not
taken
a
position
as
to
whether
that
instruct...
whether
the
objections
to
those
instructions
were
made
properly
and
preserved.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
do
take
the
position
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
reaches
the
materiality
issues,
the
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
as
to
them.
there
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
to
the
extent
that
the
judgment
depends
on
the
validity
of
the
instructions
rather
than
the
waiver
of
the
objection
to
those
instructions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
take
that
position.
we
have
been
careful--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
o'connor,
we
think
that
the
causation
instruction
in
a
case
when
shareholders
occupy
a
minority
position
should
spell
out
in
some
more
detail
than
here
what
the
causal
theory
is
as
to
why
the
misleading
proxy
statement
caused
the
injury.
for
example,
it...
the
instructions
might
say
the
plaintiffs
contend
that,
absent
minority
approval,
the
holding
company
was
not
prepared
to
go
forward
with
the
transaction.
it
had
established
that
as
a
condition.
or
there
might
be
an
instruction
that
if
accurate
disclosure
had
been
made,
the
plaintiffs
contend
they
would
have
been
able
to
enjoin
the
transaction
in
state
court.
something
that
guides
the
jury
sufficiently
so
that
they
understand
what
the
causal
inquiry
here...
what
the
causal
inquiry
really
is.
in
this
case
the
instruction
essentially
said
if
you
find
it
necessary
to
solicit
proxies,
that's
enough.
it
is
true
that
if
votes
are
needed,
proxy
solicitation
will
be
needed.
but
the
underlying
predicate
for
why
the
votes
were
needed
just
simply
wasn't
presented
to
the
jury.
there
are
three
reasons
why
we
believe
that
false
or
misleading
statements
of
reasons
or
characterization
do
fall
within
the
coverage
of
the
proxy
antifraud
rules.
first,
statements
of
reason
may
be
highly
significant
to
investors
in
determining--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
was
evidence
induced
in
the
record,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
isn't
precisely
clear
from
the
record--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
there
was
evidence
presented
as
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
was
evidence
presented
as
to
the
conflict
of
interest
because
the
petitioners--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
conflict
of
interest
was
injected
into
the
case
because
there
was
a
separate
breach
of
fiduciary
duty--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
sure,
justice
white,
but
there
was
a
concession
made
by
the
plaintiff...
by
the
defendants'
attorneys
during
the
trial
that
it
was
necessary
to
solicit
proxies.
that
was
a
concession
that
was
made
in
open
court
during
examination
of
a
witness,
and
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
curtailing
further
discussion
of
that
issue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
white,
i
can't
say
whether
it
functioned
as
a
stipulation
in
this
case
or
whether
there
was
other
evidence.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
materiality
issues
in
the
case,
because
those
are
of
importance
both
to
the
government
and
in
private
actions,
since
the
same
concept--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
there
are
several
reasons,
justice
scalia,
why
interpreting
the
causation
element
of
this
recognized
cause
of
action
to
cover
cases
like
this
one
is
appropriate.
first
of
all,
there
can
be
direct
injury
suffered
by
a
shareholder
who
relies
on
a
proxy
statement
and
votes
in
favor
of
a
merger,
even
if
his
votes,
combined
with
all
other
minority
shareholders',
couldn't
block
the
transaction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
but
this
is
an
express
federal
provision
under
rules
promulgated
by
the
sec
and
by
other
agencies
that
prohibits
false
and
misleading
proxy
statements.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
more
generally,
justice
scalia,
to
protect
the
state-created
processes
that
function
in
the
corporate
governance
context.
states
don't
only
provide
the
requirement
that
certain
matters
be
put
to
shareholder
votes.
they
provide
mechanisms
whereby
shareholders
can
make
those
rights
effective.
those
include
appraisal
rights
if
they
disagree
in
certain
circumstances.
they
also
include
the
right
to
get
an
injunction
against
a
merger.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
in
all
states
if
you
vote
for
a
merger
you
are
precluded
from
taking
advantage
of
the
state-created
right.
so
i
think
in
general
the
proxy
rules
have
to
be
read
as
an
overlay
to
state
policies
in
the
field
of
corporate
governance.
and
the
requirement
of
accurate
disclosure
preserves
the
effectiveness
of
those
rights,
which
might
otherwise
be
lost
because
shareholders
lack
the
information--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
right
of
action
that
was
recognized
itself,
which
required
an
element
of
causation.
the
question
then
is
how
is
that
element
satisfied.
it
would
also
be
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
this
is
a
private
right
that
has
been
woven
into
the
fabric
of
the
securities
laws.
congress
is
well
aware
of
it,
and
it
has
touched
on
the
area
of
proxy
regulation
since
the
borak
case
was
decided,
and
congress
has
never
disposed
of
that
private
right
of
action.
the
proxy
misrepresentations
in
this
case
went
to
the
heart
of
what
the
proxy
solicitation
was
all
about.
the
reasons
why
directors
recommend
or
approve
a
transaction
are
among
the
most
fundamental
matters
that
shareholders
consider
in
determining
how
to
cast
their
vote.
the
reasons
that
have
been
given
by
the
petitioners
for
excising
this
area
of
statements
from
the
law
are
not
persuasive.
essentially
i
think
petitioners
conceded
today
that
if
there
is
nonspeculative
evidence
that
the
stated
reasons
for
the
board's
action
are
not
the
actual
reasons
that
prompted
the
board
to
act,
then
a
private...
then
an
action
can
be
brought
predicated
on
such
misstatements.
we
agree
with
that.
we
believe
that
objective
evidence
is
required
in
order
to
sustain
such
a
claim,
but
that
such
evidence
need
not
only
be
a
direct
admission
or
a
smoking-gun
document,
but
can
also
be
circumstantial
evidence
that
is
frequently
used
in
all
areas
of
the
law
to
determine
whether
the
thought
process
that
prompted
a
certain
statement
was
in
fact
accurately
represented
in
a
document.
this
is
not
something
new
to
the
law.
it
pervades
the
law
of
fraud,
and
it
is
applicable
under
other
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
we
do
not
see
that
there
are
compliance
or
enforcement
difficulties
in
a
regime
that
requires--
thank
you,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
