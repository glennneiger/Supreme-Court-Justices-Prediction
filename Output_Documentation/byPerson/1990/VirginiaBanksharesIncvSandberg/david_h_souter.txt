justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
directors
of
the
first
american
bank
of
virginia
approved
to
proposal
for
a
freeze-out
merger
under
which
its
minority
shareholders
will
be
paid
$42
a
share
for
their
stock
by
a
holding
company,
virginia
bankshares
incorporated,
following
which,
the
minority
shareholders
would
loose
their
interest
in
the
bank.
although
the
holding
company
owned
enough
first
american
stock
to
approve
the
merger
without
the
votes
of
the
minority
shareholders.
first
american’s
directors,
nonetheless,
circulated
a
proxy
solicitation
to
the
minority
shareholders
in
which
the
directors
urged
support
for
the
merger
and
stated
that
they
had
approved
the
plan
because
it
provided
an
opportunity
for
the
minority
shareholders
to
receive
a
high
value
for
their
stock.
after
the
merger,
the
respondent,
dora
sandberg
a
former
minority
shareholder
of
the
bank,
brought
suit
against
the
holding
companies
and
the
directors
of
the
bank
for
soliciting
proxies
by
means
of
materially
false
or
misleading
statements
in
violation
of
section
14(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
rule
14(a)(9).
sandberg
argued
that
the
statement
by
the
directors,
that
they
had
approved
the
merger
because
minority
shareholders
would
receive
a
high
value
for
their
shares
was
false
and
that
even
though
her
vote
was
not
necessary
to
authorize
the
merger.
she
should
be
permitted
to
bring
a
private
action
for
damages
under
section
14(a)
because
the
proxy
solicitation
had
for
other
reasons
formed
a
link
in
the
chain
of
causation
ultimately
resulting
in
damage
to
her.
her
suit
was
successful
in
the
district
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
the
directors’
statement
actionable
under
section
14(a),
but
we
hold
further
that
sandberg
has
not
satisfied
her
burden
to
demonstrate
causation
between
the
proxy
solicitation
in
her
damages
and
we
accordingly
reverse
the
lower
court’s
judgment.
a
knowingly
false
statement
of
reasons,
opinions,
and
beliefs
by
a
corporate
director
contained
in
a
proxy
solicitation
maybe
actionable
under
rule
14(a)(9),
that
is
because
it
satisfies
two
conditions.
first,
the
reasonable
shareholder
would
consider
it
important
in
deciding
how
to
vote.
second,
such
statement
is
subject
to
proof
or
disproof
as
a
factual
assertion
that
the
directors’
act
for
the
reason
that
was
given
or
hold
to
belief
statement,
and
the
independent
facts
justify
acting
for
such
reasons
or
holding
such
a
belief.
in
this
case,
for
example,
sandberg
and
others
presented
evidence
about
the
bank’s
assets
and
its
actual
and
potential
level
of
operation
to
prove
with
the
directors’
statement
was
misleading
about
the
stock’s
value
and
a
false
explanation
of
the
directors’
reasons
for
approving
the
merger.
we,
nonetheless,
reverse
the
judgment
because
we
hold
that
sandberg
has
not
demonstrated
causation
of
damages.
one
theory
of
causation
she
advances
is
that
the
proxy
statement
was
a
means
of
obtaining
minority
approval
without
which
the
parties
to
the
merger
would
have
been
unwilling
to
proceed
regardless
of
the
fact
that
minority
approval
was
not
legally
required.
we
reject
this
theory
because
it
would
predicate
liability
on
speculation
about
the
state
of
mind
of
corporate
directors
in
a
hypothetical
situation.
we
reject
respondent’s
further
theory
of
causation
that
the
proxy
statement
was
used
to
obtain
votes
of
the
minority
shareholders
that
bar
the
subsequent
action
in
state
court
to
avoid
the
merger
because
there
was
no
showing
that
such
a
state
law
remedy
is
no
longer
available.
