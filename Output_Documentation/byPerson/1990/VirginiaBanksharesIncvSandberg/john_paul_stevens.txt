justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
will
you
just
clear
up
one
thing
for
me?
they
claim
you
didn't
preserve
your...
this
point
well.
you
objected
to
the
instruction?
justice
stevens
and
did
you
tender
your
own
instruction
on
this
issue
that
should
have
been
given?
justice
stevens
which
was
not
given.
justice
stevens
and
the
instruction
you
tendered
is
in
the
record?
justice
stevens
and
it's
what
you
still
say
is
the
proper
instruction?
justice
stevens
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
shapiro,
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
in
your
view,
what
purpose
does
the
proxy
statement
serve
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
stevens
so
your
answer
is
none.
justice
stevens
but
no
legally
necessary
purpose.
justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
are
you
arguing
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
statement
could
never
be
actionable
or
never
misleading,
or
are
you
arguing
that
on
this
record
the
facts
don't
support
the
finding
that
it
was
misleading?
justice
stevens
but
on
the
first
point
is
it
not
clear
that
if
they
all
had
secret
notes
that
said
we
think
$60
is
a
fair
price
and
then
the
proxy
statement
said
they
thought
$42
would
be
a
fair
price,
that
that
would
be
misleading?
justice
stevens
but
that's
a
question
of
fact.
that's
a
question
of
fact
and
question
of
evidence,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
this
court
hasn't
uniformly
done
that.
and
i
am
just
interested
in
why
a
statement
that
mr.
x
believes
$42
is
a
fair
price
could
not
be
a
misleading
statement
of
fact
if
he
in
fact
thought
the
price
ought
to
be
$90.
justice
stevens
i
know
the
dangers,
but
you're
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
can
never
be
a
misleading
statement?
justice
stevens
unless
there
is
evidence
to
show
it's
a
false
statement.
justice
stevens
but
this
group
did
not
propose
that
price,
did
it?
they
passed
on
the
price
which
had
been
suggested
by
someone
else.
justice
stevens
they
originated
the
$42
price?
justice
stevens
does
your
opponent
agree
with
that
construction
of
the
evidence?
justice
stevens
so
your
position
would
be
the
same
even
if
they
did
not
originate
the
price?
justice
stevens
i
am
puzzled
about
this
notion
that
just
some
of
them
made
the
objection,
because
aren't
they
all
parties
here?
aren't
they
all
petitioners?
justice
stevens
well,
then
the
question's
here,
isn't
it?
if
anyone
of
them
made
the
objection,
then
it
is
here
in
this
record
for
us
to
decide,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
as
to
them.
but
we
still
have
to
decide
it
as
to
bankshares,
if
they
did
make
it.
i
mean,
i
understand
your
point.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
us
whether
we're
deciding
as
to
one
petitioner
or
both,
if
we
have
to
decide
the
question.
justice
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
i
mean,
i
know
you
want
to
talk
about
the
misleading
part,
but
do
you
have
a
view
on
the
causation
issue
as
to
whether
all
that
is
properly
reserved
for
our
review
or
not?
justice
stevens
so
you
really
don't
take
a
position
on
the
ultimate
question
of
what
we
should
do
with
this
judgment?
