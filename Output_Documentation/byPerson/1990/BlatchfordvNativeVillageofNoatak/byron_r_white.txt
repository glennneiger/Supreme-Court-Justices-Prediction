--that's
right.
where
was
that
suit
brought?
federal,
state
court?

court.
justice

do
you
think
an
indian
tribe
may
sue
a
state
in
its
own
court,
in
the
state's
own
courts
against
the
state's...
without
the
state's
consent?
justice
white
well,
why
is
the
federal
court
different?

why

justice
white
i
would
think
you
would
have
answered...
at
least
you...
i'll
ask
you
another
question.
do
you
think
congress
could
constitutionally
say
that
state
sovereign
immunity
will
not
be
good
against
a
suit
by
an
indian
tribe
in
the
state's
own
courts?
justice
white
but
they
haven't.
justice
white
but
they
have,
you
think,
without
saying
a
word...
state,
the...
the
states
do
not
have
sovereign
immunity
in
the...
without
congress
saying
the
word,
the
states
do
not
have
sovereign
immunity
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
white
that
argument
goes
only
to
the
federal
courts,
apparently.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
earlier
in
your
argument
you
said
the
states,
when
they...
waived
their
sovereign
immunity.
justice
white
just
to
the
federal
courts?
justice
white
can
the
united
states
sue
a
state
in
a
state
court
on
an
indian
claim
despite
the
state's
sovereign
immunity?
