chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-1782,
david
hoffman
v.
native
village
of
noatak
and
circle
village.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
lee.
the
spectators
are
admonished
the
court
remains
in
session.
there
is
to
be
no
talking.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
states
were
at
least
as...
at
as
high
a
degree
of
dignity,
so
to
speak,
as
the
indian
tribes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
all
you
have
to
show
is--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
monaco
against
mississippi
was
wrongly--
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lee.
mr.
aschenbrenner,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
on
any
other
claim
that
the
united
states
chooses
to
bring.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
isn't
peculiar
to
indian
claims.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
it
makes
no
difference
who
the
plaintiff
in
those
suits
is,
whether
it's
the
united
states
or
some
group
of
indians?
chief
justice
rehnquist
pardon
me.
if
a
federal
forum
was
essential
to
the
plan
of
the
convention,
it
didn't
prove
to
be
essential
in
the
first
200
years,
i
take
it,
since
this
really
is
the
first
of
these
cases
that
has
been
brought
to
this
court,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
maybe
we
should
recognize
one
set
each
100
years.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
suing
on
behalf
of
the
indians,
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
did
the
states
consent
to
these...
or
to
be
sued
by
indian
tribes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
united
states--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes,
but
that...
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
i
asked
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
said
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
how
the
states
consented
to
be
sued
by
indian
tribes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
go
ahead.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
fidelity...
was
that
fidelity...
that
was
the
counterclaim
case,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
was
also
where
they
extended
the
tribal
sovereign
immunity
to
counterclaims.
is
that
also
the
leading
reasoning
for
the
immunity
of
the
tribes
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
the
explanation
for
the
whole
thing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
think
the
concept
of
the
united
states
as
a
trustee
for
the
indian
tribes
is
clear
from
the
constitution,
or
is
that
something
that
just
developed
by
practice
and
statute
after
the
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
well...
what
was
the
fact,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that
isn't
just...
that
isn't
a
general
duty
to
protect
the
tribes.
it's
a
duty
to,
to
deal
faithfully
with
land
that
is
held
for
the
tribe,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that,
that
was
at
the
hands
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
itself,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
could
an
indian
tribe
sue
the
united
states
and
say
we...
not
with
respect
to
any
land
or
not
with
respect
to
anything
the
united
states
was
doing,
but
just
saying
you're
not
doing
enough
for
us?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
order...
well,
would
it
be
a
federal...
a
breach
of
federal
law
if
a
tribe
somewhere,
say
in
alaska,
said
we're
very
poor,
we're
losing
our
culture,
and
we
really
need
lots
of
money
to
restore
it.
would
that
be
a
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
has
to
be
something
a
good
deal
more
tangible
than
that,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
states
have
diplomatic
relations
with
the
tribes
before
the
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
i
mean
diplomatic
relations
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word,
not
just
occasional--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--other
states,
too?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
moe...
was
moe
a
suit
against
the
state?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
state
of
montana?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
aschenbrenner,
do
you
have
at
your
fingertips
a
citation
somewhere
to
the
moe
opinion
where
it
shows
that
the
state
of
montana
was
a
party?
would
you...
would
you
file
it
with
the
clerk
after--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
aschenbrenner.
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
lee,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
