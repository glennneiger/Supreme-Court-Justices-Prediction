justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
can
i
ask
this
question?
it
goes
to
that.
is
the
sovereign
immunity
bar
that
you
rely
on
one
that
predated
the
eleventh
amendment,
or
is
it
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
stevens
because
if
it's
the
latter,
then
of
course
the,
the
constitutional
convention
business
would
be
irrelevant.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
of
course
states
can
sue
each
other.
justice
stevens
--mr.
lee,
do
you
think
your
argument
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
holding
in
nevada
against
hall?
justice
stevens
the
citizen
of--
justice
stevens
it
seemed
to
me
your
arguments
would
have
required
the...
a
different
result
in
that
case.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
you
mean
the
clear
statement
rule.
justice
stevens
because
there
was
no
congressional
statement
whatsoever
there--
justice
stevens
mr.
aschenbrenner,
i'm
surprised
at
your
answer.
i
thought
one
of...
there
are
three
different
theories
for
sovereign
immunity.
one
is
that
a
state
can
control
in
its
own
judicial
system
what
cases
it
will
entertain,
and
i
would
assume
a
state
could
have
its
own
sovereign
immunity
for
cases
within
its
own
state
system.
and
i
don't
know
what
the
power
of
congress
would
be
to
tell
a
state
it
must
entertain
actions
by
indian
tribes
in
its
own
state's
court
system.
i
don't
understand
the
basis
for
your
answer
to
justice
white.
justice
stevens
it's
quite
different
when
a
different
sovereign,
when
it's
suing
in
the
federal
system
it's
arguable
under
the
nevada
against
hall
rationale
that
they
don't
have
any
sovereign
immunity
there.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that
congress
can
abrogate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
when
it's
governing
its
own
court
system.
justice
stevens
maybe
you
don't...
we
don't
have
to
argue
about
that
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
lee,
since
you've
got
a
couple
of
minutes
left?
supposing
that
the
tribe
tried
to
sue
the
state
of
alaska
in
the
state
of
california...
say
they
were
able
to
get
jurisdiction
as
happened
in
the--
justice
stevens
--correct.
and
then
the
state
of
alaska
pleaded
sovereign
immunity.
what
law
would
govern
that
plea?
would
it
be
california
law,
alaska
law,
or
federal
law?
justice
stevens
right.
