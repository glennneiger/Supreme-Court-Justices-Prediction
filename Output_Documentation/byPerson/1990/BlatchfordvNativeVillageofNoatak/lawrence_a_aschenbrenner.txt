mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
alaska
and
amicus
states
tell
us
that
if
tribes
are
permitted
to
sue
the
states
directly
it
will
upset
the
constitutional
plan,
endanger
the
states'
treasuries,
and
violate
the
fundamental
principle
that
sovereign
states
can't
be
sued
without
their
consent.
the
states
imply
that
there
may
be
many
cases
pending
if
this
court
should
open
the
floodgates
to
direct
tribal
suits.
the
facts
are
otherwise.
it
has
been
over
14
years
since
this
court
decided
moe
v.
salish
and
kootenai,
which
the
lower
courts
immediately
construed
to
abrogate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
by
tribes,
and
there
has
been
a
grand
total
of
nine
tribal-state
suits
filed.
and
none
of
those
nine
have
apparently
been
so
damaging
to
the
state
treasuries
that
a
single
state
has
bothered
to
go
back
to
congress
and
seek
their
reversal.
nor
can
it
be
accurately
stated
that
permitting
direct
tribal
suits
would
upset
the
constitutional
balance.
it's
not
as
if
the
states
came
here
with
their
historic
sovereign
immunity
fully
intact.
to
the
contrary,
they
have
already
surrendered
their
immunity
and
consented
to
be
sued
by
the
united
states
on
every
indian
claim
the
government
chooses
to
bring.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
yes,
your
honor.
in
short,
though,
with
respect
to
indian
claims,
the
federal
courthouse
doors
are
already
wide
open.
thus
the
question
for...
before
this
court
is
whether
permitting
tribes
to
bring
the
same
identical
suits
which
the
states
have
already
consented
to
be
sued
on
would
upset
the
constitutional
balance.
and
we
submit
to
you
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
that
is
correct.
it
would
not
upset
the
constitutional
balance
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
the
states
consented
to
be
sued
on
direct
tribal
claims
inherently
in
the
constitutional
plan.
in
u.s.
v.
texas
and
south
dakota
v.
north
carolina
this
court
held
that
a
federal
forum
for
the
peaceful
resolution
of
federal-state
and
state-state
suits
was
essential
to
the
peace
and
permanence
of
the
nation.
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
the
threat
of
indian
wars
was
far
more
eminent
and
critical
than
wars
between
the
states.
recall
that
during
the
articles
of
the
confederation
numerous
wars
had
occurred,
the
federalist
papers
tell
us.
and
numerous
lives
had
been
slaughtered,
madison
tells
us.
recall
that
on
the
eve
of
the
convention
georgia
had
invaded
creek
territory
and
attempted
to
set
up
counties,
and
that
north
carolina
had
intruded
on
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws,
and
they
were
hostile.
and
new
york
had
intruded
on
the
iroquois,
and
they
were
hostile.
the
historians
tell
us
that
the
reason
georgia
so
rapidly
ratified
the
constitution
was
to
get
federal
defense
in
case
the
creeks
attacked.
and
that's
the
way
it
was
when
the
constitution
was
adopted.
if,
therefore,
a
federal
forum
was
so
essential
to
keep
the
peace
of
the
nation
in
the
case
of
u.s.
state
and
state-state
suits,
far
more
so
was
such
a
forum
necessary
to
keep
the
peace
in
tribal-state
disputes.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
i
think
they
did,
your
honor,
for
this
reason,
and
i
cite
justice
stevens'
dissent
in
oneida
v.
oneida,
where
they
quoted
george
washington's
speech
to
the
senecas.
and
george
washington,
recall,
was
the
president
of
the
constitutional
convention,
the
lead
framer,
if
you
will.
and
when
in
1790,
just
1
year
after
the
constitution
was
adopted,
he
gave
a
speech
to
corn
planter,
chief
of
the
senecas,
he
said
if
your
rights
have
been
violated
under
the
indian
non-intercourse
act
either
by
individuals
or
states,
he
said,
"the
federal
courts
will
be
open
to
you.
"
but
even
assuming
for
a
moment
that
marshall
was
right
and
that
most
of
the
framers
didn't
have
the
tribes
in
view
when
they
drafted
article
iii,
the
jurisdictional
provision,
that
just
begs
the
question.
the
question
is...
this
court
has
many,
there
are
many
questions
which
the
framers
didn't
contemplate
which
this
court
has
nonetheless
been
compelled
to
answer.
and
so
the
question
is
not
what
the
framers
actually
had
in
mind,
but
whether
a
federal
court
forum
to
resolve
these
kind
of
controversies
was
essential
to
the
plan
of
the
convention.
so
that--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
following
that
reasoning,
one
could
say
that
state
versus
state...
federal
jurisdiction
over
state
versus
states
disputes
was
not
essential
to
the
constitutional
plan
either,
because
it
took
until
1892,
100
years
later,
before
you
first
decided
that
one.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
this
is
the
year.
[laughter]
the
more
precise
question
then
again
before
this
court
is
whether
a
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
direct
tribal
suits
is
likewise
essential
to
the
constitutional
plan,
not
just
suits
by
the
united
states
on
indian
claims.
and
i
submit
this
depends
on
whether
all
tribal-state
controversies
would
be
subject
to
resolution
if
only
the
government
could
bring
the
claims,
and
that
this
court
has
answered
no.
in
moe
v.
salish
and
kootenai
and
arizona
v.
san
carlos
apache
this
court
found
that
the
government
is
not
infrequently...
has
a
conflict
of
interest
which
precludes
it
from
suing
on
behalf
of
the
states,
or
it's
otherwise
unwilling
to
sue.
indeed
this
court
said
that
was
one
of
the
primary
purposes
for
adopting
1362.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
yes.
yes,
sir.
as
this
court
said
in
poafpybitty
v.
skelly,
quote,
"the
indians'
right
to
sue
should
not
depend
on
the
good
judgment
or
zeal
of
a
government
attorney.
"
accordingly,
because
all
tribal-state
controversies
could
not
be
resolved
unless
the
indians
could
sue
where
the
government
couldn't
or
wouldn't
sue,
federal
jurisdiction
over
direct
tribal
disputes
is
inherent
in
the
plan
of
the
convention.
this...
this
court's
case
in
arizona
v.
california
supports
the
conclusion
that
federal
court
jurisdiction
is
not
strictly
limited
to...
indian
claims
brought
by
the
united
states.
recall
in
that
case
this
court
allowed
five
indian
tribes
to
intervene
in
a
case
that
the
government
had
filed,
over
the
objections
of
the
states,
the
eleventh
amendment
objections
of
the
states,
even
though
the
indian
claims
were
far
more
expansive
than
the
federal
claims.
now,
if
federal
court
jurisdiction
is
strictly
limited
to...
and
party
based
to
the
united
states,
they
should
have
never
been
permitted
to
intervene.
but
justice
white,
for
the
court,
said
nonetheless
the
tribes
are
entitled
to
take
their
place
as
independent,
qualified
members
of
the
body
politic,
and
accordingly
their
participation
in
litigation
critical
to
their
welfare
should
not
be
discouraged,
and
they
were
admitted
in.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
all
right,
we'll
get
to
that
point
right
now,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
it's
true
that
what...
let
me
start...
preface
that
by
saying
it's
true
that
the
consents
were
not
reciprocal.
the
states
consented
to
be
sued
by
the
tribes,
we
submit,
but
the
tribes
didn't
consent
to
be
sued
by
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
no,
it's
a
result
of
history
and
how
the
constitution
was
constructed.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
well,
in
the
first
place
they
of
course
consented
to
be
sued
by
the
united
states
on
indian
claims--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--and
that
benefit
of
that
ran
to
the
tribes--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--even
though
they
didn't--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--pardon
me.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
how
they
did
that?
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
i...
we
submit
they
did
it
the
same
way
they
consented
to
be
sued
by
other
states
in
the
united
states.
it
was
inherent
in
the
constitutional
plan
because
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
peace.
but
i'm
trying
to
answer...
if
that
answers
your
question--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--i'm
trying
to
get,
to
answer
why
the
states
can't
sue
the
tribes.
the
tribes,
the
states...
well,
the
tribes
can
sue
states
because
the
states
consented
to
it
in
the
constitutional
plan.
on
the
other
hand,
the
tribes
were
not
participants
in
the
constitutional
plan,
and
therefore
they
cannot
be
said
to
have
consented
to
anything.
further,
the
sovereign
immunity
of
states
and
the
tribes
developed
along
different
lines.
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states
has
been
justified
almost
solely
on
the
ground
of
protecting
the
state
treasury.
sovereign
immunity
of
the
tribes,
on
the
other
hand,
has
been
based
on
that,
but
also
on
the
federal
policy
embodied
in
numerous
laws
to
further
tribal
self-government
and
protect
economic
self-sufficiency
of
the
tribes.
thus
the
congress
has
codified
the
tribes'
sovereign
immunity,
and
therefore
only
congress
can
abrogate
it.
this
court's
rationale
in
the
leading
tribal
sovereignty
case,
u.s.
v.
fidelity,
tells
us
indeed
that
the
united
states
holds
the
tribes'
sovereign
immunity
in
trust
for
the
tribes,
just
like
it
holds
their
property
in
trust.
therefore,
states
cannot
sue
tribes
because
they
would
be
suing
the
united
states,
the
tribes'
trustee.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
yes,
sir,
that
was.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
this...
the
statement
i
am
relying
on
has
been
frequently
quoted,
and
it
says,
quote,
"it
is
as
though
the
immunity
which
was
the
tribes,
as
sovereigns,
passed
to
the
united
states
for
their
benefit,
as
their...
tribal
properties
did.
"
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
that's
the
explanation
of
why
tribes
can
sue
states,
but
that
congress
is
the
one
that
can
abrogate
the
tribes'
immunity
and
put
the
states
on
the
same
plan
with
the
tribes.
the
same
constitutional
plan
under
which
the
tribes
consented
to
suit
by
the
states
gave
the
congress
the
power
to
rectify
any
imbalance,
but
thus
far
congress
has
realized
that
sovereign
immunity
is
important
to
the
tribes,
and
it's
important
because
it
furthers
the
strong
federal
policies
supporting
tribal
self-government
and
economic
self-sufficiency.
to
the
extent
tribes
go
bankrupt,
a
greater
burden
is
placed
on
the
federal
government.
therefore
congress
should
be
the
one
to
abrogate
tribal
sovereign
immunity--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--pardon
me?
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
yes,
it
can.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
well,
one
could
do
that
if
one
wanted
to
assume
that
the
resolution
of
tribal-state
conflicts
at
the
time
of
the
convention...
not
now,
we're
dealing
with
at
the
time
of
the
convention...
wasn't
equally
or
more
important
to
the
peace
of
the
nation
than
state-state
or
federal-state
controversies.
it
seems
to
me
history...
history
dictates
one
answer.
and
indeed
there...
the
states
must
have
agreed
partially
because
they
did
consent
to
suits
by
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
tribal
claims.
in
other
words,
there
was
an
imbalance
between
the
states
and
the
tribes
from
the
very
beginning.
the
balance
was
struck
that
way
when
the
constitution
was
adopted.
now
the
states
also
argue
that
the
government
has
a
trust
responsibility
to
sue
on
behalf
of
tribal
claims,
and
the
states
are
entitled
to
rely
on
the
good
judgment
of
the
government
in
deciding
which
and
when
it
will
bring
tribal
claims.
well,
i
tell
you
in
the
first
place,
the
government's
trust
responsibility
is
for
the
protection
of
the
tribes,
not
the
states.
therefore
the
government's...
they
have,
are
not
entitled
to
rely
on
the
government's
discretion
when
the
government
is
exercising
its
trust
responsibility.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
in
the
state's
own
courts?
i
haven't
thought
about
that
directly,
but
it...
it's
not
necessary
to
my
argument
to
say
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
we're
talking
about
the
federal
courts
and
the
federal
constitutional
plan.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
pardon?
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
because
we're
relying
on
the
federal
structure,
the
constitutional
plan,
what
did
the
framers
believe.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
yes,
i
think
it
probably
could.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
but
they
haven't,
no.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
right.
it's
inherent
in
the
constitutional
plan.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
well--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--well--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--i
haven't
really
addressed
that
in
my
own
mind,
your
honor,
so
i
shouldn't
have
committed
myself.
i'm
going
to
go
back
a
moment
to
the
state's
argument
that
they
should
be
allowed...
able
to
rely
on
the
good
judgment
of
the
government
in
determining
what
tribal
claims
should
be
brought.
the
unstated
premise
of
that
argument,
i
submit,
is
that
the
federal
government
would
be
less
zealous
in
pursuing
tribal
claims
than
the
tribes
would
be
on
their
own
behalf,
and
therefore
there
would
be
greater
potential
liability
of
the
state
treasury.
but
we
suggest
the
court
should
not
construe
the
constitutional
scope
of
federal
jurisdiction
on
any
assumption
other
than
the
federal
government
would
fully,
faithfully,
and
zealously
carry
out
its
sacred
trust
responsibility
to
the
tribes.
and
operating
on
that
assumption,
it
could
mean
no
difference
to
the
states
whether
they
are
sued
by
the
united
states
or
by
the
tribes,
save
and
except
those
limited
cases
where
the
government
has
a
conflict
or
is
otherwise
unable
to
act.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
well,
the
court
has
said
both,
i
think.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
i
think
that
the
trust
responsibility,
the
court
has
said,
arose
from
the
power
and
the
dependence
of
the
tribes.
from
the
power
that
was
delegated
the
federal
government
in
conjunction
with
the
very
dependent
status
of
the
tribes
arose
a
duty
to
protect
the
tribes.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
oh,
far
more
than
land,
your
honor.
even
in
your
own
case
of
moe
v.
salish
and
kootenai,
where
you
refer
to
it...
i
can't
quote
you
exactly,
but
you
said
something
to
the
effect
that
it
was...
the
duty
is
to
protect
tribal
self-government.
and
even
the
cherokee
nation
case
was
all
about
the
annihilation
of
the
cherokee
government.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
no,
it
was
at
the
hands
of
georgia.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
oh,
certainly
not,
your
honor.
no.
there
has
to
be
a
breach,
a
clear
breach
of
federal
law.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
certainly
not,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
i
agree.
no
question.
in
short
what
we're
saying,
that
direct
tribal
suits
would
not
upset
the
federal
constitutional
balance
because
the
states
would
not
be
subjected
to
a
single
indian
claim
which
they
could
otherwise
claim
immunity
from.
now
the
states
also
ask
how
can
the
indian
commerce
clause
be
self-executing
and
abrogate
sovereign
immunity
when
the
interstate
commerce
clause
isn't.
it's
not
the
indian
commerce
clause
that
wipes
out
the
states'
immunity
from
suit
by
tribes.
it's
the
structure
of
the
constitution
that
is
inherent
in
the
constitutional
plan.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
that's
all
i'm
addressing
here,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
yes.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
yes,
that's
the
only
part
of
the...
that's
the
only
thing
that's
inherent
in
the...
in
the
federal...
in
the
constitutional
structure.
that's
the
only
thing
this
court
said
in
u.s.
v.
texas
and
south
dakota
v.
north
carolina,
is
that
they
consented
to
be
sued
by
the
federal
government
and
that
sister
states,
to
keep
the
peace,
and
therefore
it
was
inherent
in
the
constitutional
plan.
all
we're
saying,
tribes
are
in
the
same
situation.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
to
finish
up
on
the
automatic
self-executing
claim
that
alaska
makes
for
our
argument,
we'd
say
on
the
other
hand
there
isn't
anything
in
the
constitutional
structure
which
dictates
that
private
suits
against
states
are
necessary
to
keep
the
peace,
and
therefore
congress
has
to
pass
a
law
abrogating
the
states'
sovereign
immunity.
now
monaco.
the
state
says
that
monaco
v.
mississippi
bars
tribal
suits,
but
the
court's
rationale
for
barring
suits
by
foreign
countries
simply
doesn't
apply
to
governments
within
the
constitutional
structure.
suits
by
foreign
nations,
the
court
said,
could
involve
international
law
questions
and
foreign
relations,
whereas
tribal-state
suits
and
state-state
suits
could
not
involve
international
relations,
because
both
the
states
and
the
tribes
were
divested
of
their
foreign
relations
authority,
the
states
by
delegating
it
to
the
united
states,
the
tribes
by...
as
a
result
of
their
dependent
status.
in
fact
in
hans
v.
louisiana
this
court
held
that
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
state-state
disputes
was,
quote,
"necessary"
because
of
the
extinguishment
of
diplomatic
relations
between
the
states.
the
precise
same
rationale
applies
to
tribal-state
disputes,
because
their
diplomatic
relations
were
extinguished
in
the
constitution.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
they
certainly
did.
under
the
articles
they
attempted
to,
and
a
number
of
times
succeeded
and
constantly
undercut
the
federal
government.
and
of
course
before...
even
before
the
articles
and
after--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--yes.
new
york
entered
into
treaties
with
them,
with
the
iroquois.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
i'm
sure
they
did,
but
i
can't
quote
them
to
you,
cite
them
to
you.
all
right,
then
we
move
onto
the
next
point,
and
that
is
the
1362
argument.
we
say
even
if
direct
tribal-state
suits
were
not
inherent
in
the
constitutional
plan,
congress
abrogated
them
under
1362.
and
1362
must
be
read
as
construed
in
moe
and
construed...
and
as
construed
in
moe
it
satisfies
the
clear
statement
rule
of
dellmuth.
now
you'll
recall
in
moe
you
held
that
a
tribe
could
sue
a
state
and
override
the
anti-injunction
act,
because
you
held
that
1362
was
intended
to
put
tribes
in
the
place
of
the
government.
now
it's
true
that
moe
involved
the
anti-injunction
act
and
not
the
eleventh
amendment,
but--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--by
name,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
yes,
sir.
it's
true
that
moe
involved
the
anti-injunction
act
rather
than
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
they
are
both
broad
jurisdictional
barriers
and
both
their
purposes
are
identical:
to
protect
the
state
treasury.
indeed
this
court
has
called
the
taxing
power
the
lifeblood
of
government.
nonetheless,
you
overrode
the
anti-injunction
act
and
permitted
tribes
to
sue,
because
you
said
the
government
could
sue.
but
even
if
1362
as
construed
in
moe
does
not
satisfy
the
clear
statement
rule,
we
submit
that
rule
is
simply
inapplicable
to
1362
for
this
reason.
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
every
other
clear
statement
case
you
have
had
because
in
none
of
them
had
this
court
previously
construed
the
statute
in
question
to
permit
suits
against
states.
the
purpose
of
the
clear
statement
rule,
after
all,
is
to
determine
congressional
intent,
and
this
is
what
the
court
already
did
in
moe.
to
reinterpret
1362
now
by
applying
the
clear
statement
rule
and
reach
a
different
result
would
be
anomalous.
to
construe
a
statute
one
way
when
one
defense
is
raised...
the
anti-injunction
act,
and
construe
the
identical
statute
a
different
way
when
a
different
defense
is
raised...
the
eleventh
amendment,
would
put
the
meaning
of
the
act
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant
rather
than
the
congress.
moreover,
reinterpretation
of
1362
is
particularly
unjustified
here,
where
congress
has
had
14
years
to
reverse
the
court's
construction
of
moe
and
hasn't
seen
fit
to
do
it.
finally,
under
the
contemporary
legal
context
doctrine
the
court
will
engage
in
the
presumption
that
congress
knows
the
law,
is
familiar
with
this
court's
precedents,
and
will
draft
its
legislation
to
conform
with
the
rules
of
construction
this
court
has
laid
down.
in
1966,
when
1362
was
passed,
the
rule
of
construction
for
abrogating
tribal
sovereign
immunity
of
this
court
was
pardon.
and
the
rule
in
pardon
was
that
when
a
state
statute
on
its
face
is
broad
enough
to
include
states,
the
states
are
included
and
their
sovereign
immunity
has
been
waived.
in
short
the
rule
in
pardon
is
almost
directly
opposite
of
the
clear
statement
rule.
under
pardon
a
state
must
be
expressly
excluded
to
avoid
liability,
whereas
under
the
clear
statement
rule
states
must
be
expressly
included
to
be
held
liable.
in
pardon
this
court
refused
to
follow
justice
white's
four-justice
dissent
demanding
a
clear
statement
rule.
and
that's
the
way
it
was
2
years
later
when
1362
was
adopted.
this
court
hadn't
even
given
a--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--yes,
i
will,
your
honor.
i
have
doubled
checked
that.
this
court
discussed
the
contemporary
legal
context
doctrine
in
dellmuth
and
implicitly
approved
of
it
while
rejecting
it,
because
the
statute
in
question
in
dellmuth
was
passed
in
1975,
whereas
only
2
years
earlier
you
had...
you
had
come
down
with
employees
v.
public
health
department
which
had
foreshadowed
the
clear
statement
rule,
and
therefore
justice
kennedy
for
the
court
said
that
the
clear
statement
rule
applied
because
congress...
was
aware
that
it
was
on
its
way.
in
our
case,
however,
the
rule
was
pardon.
and
this
court...
i
mean
congress
couldn't
have
dreamed
that
the
clear
statement
rule
was
required
when
this
court
had
just
expressly
rejected
it.
for
that
reason,
the
clear
statement
rule
should
not
be
applicable,
and
1362
should
be
construed
as
this
court
construed
it
in
moe.
finally--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--oh,
pardon
me.
