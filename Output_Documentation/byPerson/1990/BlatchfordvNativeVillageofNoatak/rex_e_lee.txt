mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
indian
tribe
can
sue
a
state
without
its
consent.
this
court
has
upheld
unconsented
waivers
of
state
sovereign
immunity
in
only
two
discrete
circumstances.
first,
either
the
united
states
or
another
state
can
sue
a
state,
because
those
suits,
this
court
has
declared,
are
essential
to
the
plan
of
the
convention.
and
second,
congress,
by
statute
can
abrogate
the
state
sovereign
immunity
so
long
as
there
is
a
clear
textual
statement
that
congress
really
intended
to
do
that.
the
effort
to
show
that
suits
against
states
by
indian
tribes
are
either
essential
to
the
plan
of
the
convention
or
that
they
have
been
approved
by
clear
textual
statement
by
congress
will
not
withstand
scrutiny.
with
respect
to
what
is
essential
to
the
plan
of
the
convention,
quite
unlike
the
united
states
and
the
states,
neither
foreign
governments
nor
indian
tribes
figured
in
the
various
compromises
and
other
arrangements
of
which
that
convention
consisted.
the
major
players
in
the
convention's
plan
were,
of
course,
the
states
themselves.
it
was
their
surrender
of
sovereign
prerogatives
that
brought
into
existence
the
new
constitution
and
the
new
republic,
the
united
states.
all
sides
agree
that,
as
stated
very
well
by
my
opponents,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
the
ability
of
the
indian
tribes
to
sue
the
states
was
even
remotely
in
view
during
that
time
of
the
constitutional
convention.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
justice
o'connor.
thank
you
for
asking
the
question.
we
are
not
giving
up
the
point.
a
tactical
judgment
was
made
along
the
line
not
to
address
it.
we
would
welcome
a
victory
on
either
ground.
on
the
merits,
we
agree
completely
with
what
judge
kozinski
had
to
say,
that
there
is
no
substantial
federal
question.
the
only
point
on
which
we
disagree
with
judge
kozinski
is
which
is
the
easier
ground,
on
which--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--we
think
not.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
only
injunctive
relief
has
to
do
with
what
has
happened,
what
would
happen
in
the
future.
that,
of
course,
is
governed
by
a
1985
statute
that
is
passed
by
the
alaska
legislature,
and
i
just
can't
see
any
possible
way
that
anyone
can
take
the
position
that
federal
law,
fourteenth
amendment
or
otherwise,
prohibits
a
state
from
lengthening
the
list
of
possible
recipients.
now
i
realize
that
that
also
goes
to
the
very
question
that
you're
asking,
which
is
the
substantial
federal
question.
the
only
reason
that
we
feel
that
the
easier,
the
cleaner,
and
the
better
ground
for
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
is
sovereign
immunity
rather
than
the
substantial
federal
question...
and
both
of
them
of
course
are
jurisdictional...
is
twofold.
the
first
is
that,
has
to
do
with
the
respective
burdens
that
are
imposed
by
those
two
doctrines.
on
the
one
hand,
under
hagans
v.
lavine
and
bell
v.
hood
and
others,
the
burden
is
on
us
at
this
stage
of
the
game
to
show
that
the
federal
question
is
so
attenuated
as
to
be
obviously
frivolous,
whereas
the
court
has
made
it
quite
clear,
as
i'd
like
to
explain
in
just
a
moment,
that
the
burden
of
establishing
that
sovereign
immunity
does
not
exist
is,
of
course,
on
the
respondents,
and
that
is
a
similarly
heavy
one.
the
second
reason
is,
pertains
really
to
the
court's
considerations
and
ours
as
well,
and
that
is
that
if
the
case
is
decided
on
hagans
v.
lavine
grounds,
that
it
becomes
a
rather
inconsequential
footnote,
hagans
v.
lavine,
that
makes
no
difference
to
anyone
in
this
courtroom,
whereas
the
sovereign
immunity
issue
involves
a
conflict
in
the
circuits.
it's
one
that
affects
my
clients
very
deeply.
it...
the
two
circuits
involved
are
two
major
indian
population
circuits
and
that
need
to
be
resolved.
so
that
while
a
victory
on
either
ground
would
not
be
unwelcome,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
concentrate
on
the
court's...
on
the
ninth
circuit's
sovereign
immunity
error.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
coming
back
to
this
concession,
and
i
really
do
regard
it
as
a
concession
by
the
respondents,
that
the
constitution
makers
simply
did
not
have
the
indian
tribes
in
view,
that
acknowledged
fact
supports
the
petitioner
and
not
the
respondents.
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
sufficiently
compelling
case
can
be
made
to
overcome
the
sovereign
immunity
bar,
and
that
burden,
as
i
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago,
is
on
the
respondents
and
not
on
the
petitioners.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
both.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
probably
the
best
statement
of
that,
incidentally,
appears
in
the
brief
of
the
academy
for
state
and
local
governments
that,
really,
sovereign
immunity
of
both
the
united
states
and
the
states
did
preexist
the
eleventh
amendment.
i
would
just
ask
in
this
respect
that
you
consider
the
anomaly
that
would
result
if
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
remains
the
law,
because
it
would
mean
that
indian
tribes
who
were
not
participants
in
either
the
convention
nor
the
eleventh
amendment
proceedings
would
be
able
to
sue
the
states,
but
that
states
who
were
participants
and
who
ceded
powers
were
what
made
the
convention
possible
could
not
sue
tribes.
and
surely
no
one
can
say
with
a
straight
face
that
that
kind
of
result
was
part
of
the
plan
of
the
convention.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
much
higher.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
insofar
as
the
plan
of
the
convention
is
concerned.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
yes.
but
that's
the
anomaly.
that's
the
anomaly,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
and
in
that
respect
they
have
something
to
give
and
something
to
get
from
the
compromise
the
states
could
sue
each
other.
but
again,
it
just
points
out
the
unevenhandedness.
no
one
disputes
that
the
state
of
alaska
cannot
sue
a
tribe.
probably
the
principal
argument--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--what
is
that?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
the
argument
that
the...
probably
the
principal
argument
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
relies,
indeed
it's
whole
opinion
rests
on
the
foundation,
that
the
naked
indian
commerce
clause,
in
the
absence
of
any
affirmative
congressional
enactment,
somehow
waives
the
state
sovereign
immunity.
that
argument
proves
too
much,
and
it
does
so
along
two
separate
dimensions.
first,
if
the
unexercised
congressional
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations,
with
the
various
states,
with
the
several
states,
and
among
the
indian
tribes,
waives
state
sovereign
immunity
in
all
suits
brought
by
indian
tribes,
then
why
not
also
in
suits
brought
by
plaintiffs
in
the
other
two
constitutionally
recognized
commercial
categories,
namely--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--exactly.
exactly.
and
not
only
monaco
v.
mississippi,
but
also
state
commercial
plaintiffs,
interstate
commercial
plaintiffs.
similarly,
if
the
bare
existence
of
congressional
law-making
power
waives
immunity,
then
why
is
there
not
also
a
waiver
in
all
suits
brought
against
states
by
plaintiffs
in
bankruptcy
cases,
in
patent
cases,
and
in
admiralty
cases?
second,
and
even
more
important,
it
is
now
well
established
that
congress
will
not
be
assumed
to
have
waived
sovereign
immunity...
waived
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
unless
there
is
a
clear
textual
statement
to
that
effect.
surely
the
law
cannot
be
otherwise
where
congress
simply
has
the
authority
to
act
but
has
not
done
so.
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
say
that
something
less
than
a
clear
congressional
textual
statement
will
not
suffice,
but
that
no
statement
at
all
will.
and
this
brings
us
to
the
argument
that
congress,
by
enacting
28
u.s.c.
section
1362,
has
satisfied
the
clear
statement
rule.
not
even
the
ninth
circuit
agrees
with
that
proposition,
and
even
a
casual
examination
of
the
statute
reveals
why.
section
1362
just
is
not
a
statute
that
deals
in
any
way
with
sovereign
immunity.
it
is
solely
a
jurisdictional
statute.
it
does
not
even
mention
states.
it
does
not
even
mention
sovereign
immunity.
there
is
no
statement
at
all,
clear,
textual,
or
any
other.
the
respondents
appear
to
recognize
as
much,
and
their
strongest
argument
with
respect
to
1362
is
that
the
clear
statement
rule
should
not
apply
for
any
statute
that
was
adopted
between
1964,
when
pardon
came
down,
and
about
the
mid-1980's,
when
this
court
in
a
series
of
cases...
probably
pennhurst,
too,
but
clearly
atascadero,
welch,
and
dellmuth...
laid
down
the
clear
statement
rule.
aside
from
its
inherent
illogic,
and
i
submit
that
it
is
inherently
illogical,
that
same
argument
would
necessarily
apply
to
a
statute
that
was
adopted
in
1973,
the
date
of
enactment
of
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
which
was
at
issue
in
atascadero,
or
in
1975,
which
was
the
date
of
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act,
which
was
the
statute
involved
in
dellmuth.
indeed,
the
very
argument
that
the
respondents
make
here
in
that
respect,
that
you
ought
to
have
one
constitutional
rule
applicable
for
one
20-year
period
and
another
one
for
all
else
in
history,
was
expressly
made,
addressed,
and
rejected
in
this
court's
most
recent
pronouncement
in
this
area,
which
is
dellmuth
v.
muth.
after
first
observing
the
unlikelihood
that
what
congress
was
really
doing
in
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
was
just
trying
to
draw
coy
little
hints,
and
that's
the
court's
language,
about
the
meaning
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
court
then
goes
on
to
say
this
the
salient
point,
in
our
view,
is
that
it
cannot
be
said
with
perfect
confidence
that
congress
in
fact
intended
in
1975
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity,
and
imperfect
confidence
will
not
suffice,
given
the
special
constitutional
concerns
in
this
area.
that
statement,
which
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
applies
just
as
much
to
a
1966
statute
as
it
does
to
a
1973
statute,
and
the
respondents
argument
here
comes
2
years
too
late.
we're
told,
however,
that
indian
tribes
should
be
able
to
sue
the
states
because
the
united
states
could
bring
the
suit.
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
bring
these
suits
on
the
indians'
behalf
cuts
solidly
in
favor
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
not
against
it.
one
of
the
firmest
pillars
of
our
eleventh
amendment,
and
generally
sovereign
immunity
jurisprudence,
is
that
it
is
a
constitutional
right;
it
will
not
be
lightly
abrogated.
but
the
federal
government
does
have
the
right
to
abrogate
it,
and
it
can
do
so
in
either
of
two
ways.
first
of
all,
congress
can
abrogate,
so
long
as
it
passes
a
statute
that
clearly
says
right
in
the
text
that
congress
intended
to
do
so.
and
the
other
way
that
the
federal
government
can
abrogate
it
is
by
the
executive
branch
bringing
suit.
what
these
plaintiffs
are
really
asking
for
is
a
rule
that
would
set
aside
sovereign
immunity
in
those
cases
where
the
federal
government
has
not
made,
where
the
united
states
has
not
made
the
necessary
judgment
call
that
suit
against
a
state
is
warranted,
given
the
intrusion
that...
by
one
sovereign
of
the
prerogatives
of
another,
that
such
suits
necessarily--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--now
that's
one
i
hadn't
thought
of.
i
remember
nevada
against
hall.
well,
of
course...
i
don't
see--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yeah,
i
remember.
it
was
a
citizen
of
california,
and...
brought
suit
in
nevada.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
found
no
sovereign
immunity
there,
but
hall
was
certainly
not
an
indian
tribe.
as
i'm
just
not--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--might
have.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
might
have,
but
i'm
not
asking
for
a
rehearing
in
nevada
v.
hall.
[laughter]
i
have
one
state
to
worry
about,
and
not
another.
but
you
see,
nevada
v.
hall
long
antedated
what
i
think
in
all
fairness
you
have
to
regard
as
a
rule
that
began
to
emerge
within
about
the
last
6
or
7
years.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
clear
statement
rule,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
was
no
congressional
statement
whatsoever.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
it
was
brought
in
state
court,
but...
in
state
court
of
california,
as
i
remember.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
i
don't
think
that
one
really,
really
affects,
really
affects
my
analysis.
similarly
unpersuasive
is
the
contention,
for
reasons
that
were
alluded
to
just
a
moment
ago
by
the
chief
justice,
that
sovereign
immunity
applies
only
to
suits
by
individuals
and
not
governments,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
you
can...
that
these
respondents
qualify
as
governments.
and
that,
of
course,
is
squarely
rejected
by
the
holding
in
monaco
v.
mississippi,
which
the
respondents
concede.
but
they
have
an
explanation
for
monaco
v.
mississippi,
and
it
is
that
there
was
a
subterfuge
involved
in
that
case.
the
assignment
of
the
confederate
state
bonds
by
the
individual
holders
to
a
government.
the
individuals
couldn't
bring
the
suit,
but
they
assigned
them
to
a
government
so
that
the
government
could.
there
are
two
problems
with
that,
with
that
argument.
first
is
that
the
court
simply
didn't
rely
on
that
argument.
and
the
second
is
that
once
again
it
proves
too
much
because
that
identical
circumstance,
assignment
of
confederate
state
bonds
by
their
individual
holders
to
a
state,
was
precisely
what
was
at
issue
in
the
leading
case
standing
for
the
proposition
that
a
state
can
sue
another
state,
namely
south
dakota
v.
north
carolina.
and
indeed
in
south
dakota
v.
north
carolina
that
very
argument
was
made
and
rejected.
the
real
difference,
i
submit,
is
not
whether
it's
an
individual
or
a
government.
the
only
difference
that
really
matters
is
what
was
in
the
plan
of
the
convention.
the
states
and
the
federal
government
were
the
participants
in
the
convention,
so
that
suits
by
either
of
them
are
essential
to
the
convention's
plan.
now,
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
position
concerning
sovereign
immunity,
then
it
need
never
reach
the
question
that
the
more
i
get
into
it
the
more
i
can
see
that
it
is
complex
and
difficult
and
would
have
farranging
consequences.
and
that
is
if
you
assume
that
there
is
some
entity
that
is
indian
related
that
can
sue
a
state,
how
do
you
determine
who
those
indian-related
entities
are?
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
on
this
issue
just
cannot
be
the
law,
because
what
that
court
has
done
is
to
take
two
other
statutes
whose
coverage
and
definition
include
far
more
than
just
tribes
and
whose
purposes
have
nothing
to
do
with
either
sovereign
immunity
or
section
1362,
and
declare
that
any
group
of
natives
covered
by
either
the
indian
reorganization
act
or
the
alaska
native
claims
settlement
act
automatically
have
all
state
sovereign
immunity
defenses
waived
in
their
favor
in
any
suit
they
bring
against
the
state.
it
would
mean,
for
example,
that
native-owned
fishermen's
cooperatives,
purely
commercial
ventures,
or
i
would
assume,
residential
neighborhood
watch
associations
composed
of
native
members
could
sue
the
state.
the
reason
is
that
the
indian
reorganization
act,
which
is
one
of
the
incorporation
by
reference
statutes
that
the
ninth
circuit
used,
extends
not
just
to
tribes
but
also
to...
and
i'm
quoting...
groups...
groups
having
a
common
bond
of
occupation
or
association
or
residence.
you're
led
to
the
conclusion
that
judge
kozinski's
footnote
on
this
issue
is
probably
right,
that
it
extends
to...
that
any
group
of
natives
that
has
any
kind
of...
that
has
a
native
american
membership
and
has
any
common
bond
of
association
has
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
waived
in
suits
brought
by
them.
finally,
and
perhaps
worst
of
all,
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
would
make
a
shambles
of
existing
sovereign
immunity
principles
for
this
reason.
you
start
from
the
proposition,
and
even
the
ninth
circuit
agrees
with
this,
that
section
1362
does
not
waive
sovereign
immunity,
and
yet
you
end
up
in
a
rule...
with
a
rule
that
for
a
group
of
plaintiffs
far
broader,
far
broader
than
those
identified
by
1362,
sovereign
immunity
is
waived
as
to
them.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'll
only
use
one
of
them
for
just
two
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
find
nothing
less
than
extraordinary
the
proposition
that
suits
by
tribes
against
states
were
built
into
the
convention's
plan.
all
agree
that
no
one
was
thinking
about
this
particular
issue
at
the
time
of
the
convention,
and
it
just
isn't
enough
under
this
court's
well-established
jurisprudence
to
say
that
such
a
core
governmental
right
will
be
set
aside
in
any
case
where
it
can't
be
shown
that
someone
at
the
convention
didn't
stand
up
and
say,
look,
affirmatively,
we're
going
to
say
that
tribes
can't
sue.
that
just
is
not
the
way
the
burden
works.
that's
point
number
one.
point
number
two
is
that
my
opponents
have
effectively
conceded
here
in
oral
argument
the
same
thing
that
they
have
effectively
conceded
in
the
briefs,
that
1362
can't
pass
muster
under
the
clear
statement
rule.
but
neither
mr.
aschenbrenner
nor
anybody
else
has
been
able
to
come
up
with
an
answer
to
the
obvious
point
that
if
his
new
rule
were
the
law...
that
is,
one
constitutional
standard
for
one
20-year
period
and
other
constitutional
standard
for
any
other
period...
it
would
have
equally
precluded
the
result
in
both
atascadero
and
dellmuth.
thank
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
make
it
completely
comparable
to
nevada
v.
hall.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
will
give
you
the
answer,
though
i
will
say
that
i
am
uncertain.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
my...
my
reaction
is
it
would
probably
be
california
law.
