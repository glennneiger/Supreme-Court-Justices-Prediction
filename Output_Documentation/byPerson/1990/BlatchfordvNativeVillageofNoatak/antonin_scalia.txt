of

that

is

referred

in

the
fact
that
states
can
sue
each
other.
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
they
really
expected
the
creeks
and
the
choctaws
to
hire
a
lawyer,
do
you?
justice
scalia
mr.
aschenbrenner,
does
your...
is
this
a
two-way
street
that
you're
urging?
i
guess
the
tribes
have
no
sovereign
immunity
either,
then,
right?
justice
scalia
that's
extraordinary.
i
thought
the
states
were
in
control
of
it,
and
they
come
out
with
the
short
end
of
the
stick.
the
tribes
have
sovereign
immunity
and
the
states
don't.
they
must
have
been
very
stupid
people
back
then.
i
don't
know
how
that
happened.

the
second
case
is
blatchford
versus
native
village
of
noatak
no.
89-1782.
that
case
is
also
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1980,
alaska
enacted
a
revenue
sharing
plan
that
provided
annual
payments
to
alaskan
native
villages
about
$25,000
to
each
village.
the
state's
attorney
general
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
restricted
the
grants
to
a
racially
exclusive
group.
to
meet
that
objection,
the
state
legislature
subsequently
expanded
the
program
to
cover
all
unincorporated
communities
regardless
of
the
racial
composition
of
their
members.
since
the
available
funds
had
to
be
distributed
more
broadly,
each
native
village
received
less
than
it
previously
would
have.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
two
native
villages
that
were
affected
by
this
change.
they
challenged
the
new
program
claiming
that
it
too
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
and
they
sought
damages
for
the
legislature's
action.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
on
the
basis
of
the
eleventh
amendment
which
recognizes
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
against
suit
in
federal
courts.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
first,
on
the
ground
that
congress
had
abrogated
state
immunity
from
suit
by
indians
and
then
upon
reconsideration,
on
the
ground
that
the
eleventh
amendment
did
not
apply
to
suits
by
indian
tribes.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
first
reject
the
view
advanced
by
respondent
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
apply
to
suits
by
indian
tribes
because
indian
tribes
are
sovereigns,
not
individuals.
we
rejected
that
same
argument
many
years
ago
in
a
case
called
monaco
versus
mississippi,
where
we
held
that
states
retained
their
immunity
against
suits
by
foreign
nations.
if
immunity
survives
against
foreign
sovereigns,
there
is
no
reason
why
it
would
not
survive
against
domestic
sovereigns
as
well.
likewise,
we
reject
respondent's
claim
that
waiver
of
state
immunity
against
suit
by
indian
tribes
is
inherent
in
the
constitution.
where
we
have
found
such
an
inherent
waver
in
the
structure
of
the
constitution,
it
has
been
an
even
exchange.
each
state,
for
example,
has
waved
its
own
immunity
from
suits
by
other
states
in
exchange
for
their
wa'ver
of
immunity
from
suits
by
it.
here,
however,
there
would
be
no
mutuality.
states
would
become
subject
to
suit
by
indian
tribes
while
indian
tribes
remain
immune
to
suits
by
states.
this
is
not
inherent
in
the
constitution.
finally,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
statute
granting
district
court's
jurisdiction
to
hear
federal
claims
by
indian
tribes
28
u.s.c.
1362
operates
to
negate
state
immunity.
contrary
to
respondent's
suggestion,
this
is
neither
a
delegation
to
tribes
of
the
federal
government's
authority
to
sue
on
the
indian's
behalf
nor
is
it
a
congressional
abrogation
of
state
immunity.
section
1362
is
simply
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
hear
claims
arising
under
federal
law.
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
claim
does
not,
in
of
itself,
negate
defenses
to
that
claim.

blackmun

dissent
