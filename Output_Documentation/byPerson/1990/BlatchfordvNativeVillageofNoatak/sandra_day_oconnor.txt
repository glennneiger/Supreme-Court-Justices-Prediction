justice
o'connor
mr.
lee,
you
are
addressing,
of
course,
the
sovereign
immunity
point.
when
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
it
included
a
third
question,
asking
whether
federal
question
jurisdiction
was...
whether
it
exists,
a
point
that
was
addressed
by
judge
kozinski
in
his
dissent
below.
now
in
your
brief
on
the
merits
i
see
that
that
isn't
even
addressed.
are
you
giving
up
that
point?
justice
o'connor
is
injunctive
relief
sought
here?
and
if
so,
even
if
you
were
right
on
the
eleventh
amendment
point,
is
there
something
left?
justice
o'connor
well,
congress--
justice
o'connor
--congress
can
abrogate
a
state's
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
as
well,
can't
it?
justice
o'connor
so
we
can
just
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
congress
either
way,
i
suppose.
