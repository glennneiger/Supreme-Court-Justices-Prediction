justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
hall,
the
court--
justice
o'connor
--unambiguously,
as
you
have
put
it,
granted
the
state's
motion
to
dismiss.
and
that
motion
of
the
state
was
based
solely
on
state
procedural
grounds.
now
this
court
in
harris
adopted
in
essence
the
michigan
against
long
approach
to
determining
whether
it
fairly
appears
that
the
state
court
judgment
rests
on
federal
grounds.
and
looking
at
this
order
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
it
fairly
appears
that
that
state's
order
rests
on
federal
grounds
rather
than
the
state
procedural
bar.
justice
o'connor
do
you
have
any
virginia
supreme
court
case
that
says
that
the
deadline
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
is
not
a
procedural
bar?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
hall--
justice
o'connor
--it
seems
to
me
that
our
cases
in
wainwright
against
sykes
and
in
murray
against
carrier,
and
even
in
harris
itself,
indicates
that
we
have
moved
toward
a
general
recognition
of
the
legitimately...
legitimacy
of
adequate
and
independent
state
procedural
bars
in
federal
habeas
proceedings.
justice
o'connor
and
i'm
wondering
whether
we
aren't...
it
wouldn't
be
proper
here
to
apply
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
of
wainwright
against
sykes?
justice
o'connor
well,
now
your...
are
you
going
to
address
the
first
argument
made
by
the
petition?
justice
o'connor
whether
there
is
here
a
state
procedural
bar
that
is
independent
of
federal
law.
justice
o'connor
well,
what's
the
situation
in
virginia?
in
the
tharp
case
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
it
wouldn't
waive
time
requirements
unless
to
do
so
would
abridge
a
constitutional
right.
justice
o'connor
and
what's
your
best
authority
for
that--
justice
o'connor
--in
light
of
tharp
and
o'brien?
justice
o'connor
was
that
a
post-harris
order?
justice
o'connor
where
you
say
that
petitioner
hasn't
had
a
fair
opportunity,
your
definition
of
fair
opportunity
is
such
that
the
fact
that
the
state
accorded
a
fair
opportunity
if
its
rules
were
complied
with
isn't
enough
if
counsel
missed
the
boat.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
resolve
several
issues
concerning
the
relationship
between
state
procedural
default
and
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
a
buchanan
county,
virginia
jury
convicted
the
petitioner,
roger
keith
coleman,
of
capital
murder.
he
was
sentence
to
death
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
affirmed
both
the
conviction
and
the
sentence.
coleman
then
filed
a
petition
for
state
collateral
review
raising
numerous
federal
constitutional
claims.
the
state
court
ruled
against
coleman
on
all
the
claims.
coleman
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
from
that
judgment,
but
after
the
deadline
provided
by
the
state
for
filing
the
notice
of
appeal.
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
urging
as
the
sole
grounds
of
dismissal
that
the
notice
of
appeal
had
been
filed
late.
the
virginia
supreme
court
subsequently
granted
the
commonwealth's
motion
to
dismiss
and
it
dismissed
the
appeal
without
explaining
the
reasons
for
doing
so.
coleman
has
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
virginia
supreme
court's
dismissal
of
coleman's
notice
of
appeal
was
a
procedural
default,
that
bars
him
from
presenting
in
federal
habeas
claims
presented
for
the
first
time
in
state
collateral
review.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
it
was
for
some
of
the
same
reasons,
as
explained
by
justice
scalia
this
morning
in
his
announcement
in
the
yiltz
case.
we
also
hold
today
that
in
all
cases
in
which
a
state
prisoner
has
defaulted
a
federal
claim
in
state
court
pursuant
to
an
independent
and
adequate
state
procedural
rule,
a
federal
habeas
court
can
hear
the
claim
only
if
the
prisoner
can
demonstrate
cause
for
the
default
and
actual
prejudice
as
a
result
of
the
alleged
violation
of
federal
law
or
if
the
prisoner
can
demonstrate
that
failure
to
consider
the
claim
will
result
in
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice.
because
coleman's
claims
were
procedurally
defaulted
in
state
court,
he
must
meet
this
cause
and
prejudice
standard
before
the
district
court
can
address
its
claims.
we
hold
that
coleman
has
not
demonstrated
cause.
he
contends
that
it
was
attorney
error
that
led
to
the
late
filling
of
its
notice
of
appeal
and
to
his
procedural
fault
in
state
court.
cause,
as
that
term
is
used
in
our
habeas
cases,
is
something
external
to
the
petitioner.
attorney
error
will
constitute
cause
only
if
it
rises
to
the
level
of
an
independent
violation
of
the
petitioner's
right
to
effective
assistance
of
council.
only
then
may
we
hold
that
state
responsible
for
the
error
as
a
factor
external
to
the
petitioner.
in
the
absence
of
a
constitutional
violation
then,
the
petitioner
must
bear
the
risk
in
federal
habeas
for
attorney
errors
made
in
the
course
of
representation.
the
alleged
attorney
error
in
this
case
occurred
on
appeal
from
a
trial
court
determination
in
state
collateral
review.
our
cases,
established
clearly
that
there
is
no
right
to
council
in
such
an
appeal
and
consequently,
no
possibility
for
a
violation
of
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
council.
attorney
error,
therefore,
cannot
constitute
cause
to
excuse
coleman's
default
in
this
form.
as
coleman
does
not
argue
here
that
federal
review
of
his
claims
is
necessary
to
prevent
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice,
he
is
bared
from
bringing
these
claims
in
federal
habeas.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
marshall
and
stevens
have
joined.
