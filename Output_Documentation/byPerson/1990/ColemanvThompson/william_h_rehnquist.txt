89-7662,
roger
keith
coleman
v.
charles
e.
thompson.
mr.
hall.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
hall,
in
the
practice
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
does
that
court
ordinarily
dismiss
a
petition,
as
they
did
here,
when
they
are
deciding
the
merits
of
a
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
hall,
do
you
have
any
case
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
where
that
court
has
dismissed
a
petition
for
appeal
but
nonetheless
decided
the
merits?
my
point
is,
ordinarily--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
yeah,
but
you...
you
have
to
get
your
strength
from
some
other
case,
it
seems
to
me,
because
what
we're
looking
at
here
is
something
that
one
thinks
of
as
being
peculiar
to
procedural
motions
to
dismiss
an
appeal
rather
than
to
simply
affirm,
which
is
what
you
would
do
if
you
found...
considered
the
merits
things
and
found
them
to
be
insubstantial.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
relying
here
essentially
on
harris,
and
not
on
an
argument
that
this
was
a
ground
that
was
applied...
a
procedural
ground
that
was
unevenly
applied,
that
was
applied
in
this
case
but
perhaps--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes,
yes.
okay.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
ake,
you're
talking
about
ake
against
oklahoma?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--in
quite
a
different
context.
i
mean,
michigan
against
long
was
our
jurisdiction
to
review
a
state
decision.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
hall,
you
raised
three
questions
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
and
so
far
i
think
you
have
just
been
discussing
with
us
the
first
one.
perhaps
you'll
want
to
proceed
to
the
second
and
third
ones.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hall.
mr.
curry,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
curry.
mr.
hall,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-7662
coleman
against
thompson
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
