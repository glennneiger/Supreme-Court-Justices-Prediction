mr.
donald
r.
curry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
asking
the
court
to
affirm
in
this
case
because
essentially
what
you
have
here
is
a
case
where
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
petitioner's
guilt,
there
is
no
question
that
his
offense
is
one
that
amply
supports
his
death
sentence,
and
there
is
no
colorable
argument
here
that
refusing
him
further
federal
review
of
his
defaulted
claims
would
constitute
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
we're
asking
the
court
to
keep
faith
with
the
reasoning
of
its
previous
procedural
default
cases.
the
court
has
always
struck
the
proper
balance.
the
court
has
always
expressed
confidence
in
the
ability
of
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
to
avoid
miscarriages
of
justice.
and
in
our
view
the
confidence
has
been
fully
warranted.
but
the
court
has
also
established
a
safety
valve
exception,
a
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
to
the
cause
requirement,
for
the
extraordinary
case
where
the
defaulted
claim
is
accompanied
by
a
substantial
showing
of
actual
innocence.
but
an
important
point
needs
to
be
made
about
what
the
court
has
said
a
miscarriage
of
justice
is.
a
miscarriage
of
justice
doesn't
occur
merely
because
a
prisoner
defaults
a
claim
that
he
could
have
received
relief
on
if
he
had
preserved
it.
a
miscarriage
of
justice
occurs
only
when
an
actually
innocent
prisoner
finds
himself
in
that
position.
now
in
this
case
there
are
very
good
reasons
why
the
court
should
not
be
concerned
about
coleman's
inability
to
establish
cause
for
his
default.
but
you
don't
have
to
take
my
word
for
it,
you
can
look
at
and
listen
to
what
the
lower
federal
courts
in
this
case
have
said
and
done.
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
has
already
conducted
the
safety
valve
exception
review,
has
determined
that
he
has
not
made
a
showing
of
actual
innocence,
and
has
determined
that
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
doesn't
apply.
and
in
view
of
the
dna
testing
which
coleman
himself
has
conducted,
at
his
insistence
by
his
own
expert,
that--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--no,
it
was
not
part
of
the
record.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
my
only
point
in
bringing
it
up
is
that
it
only
corroborates
what
the
fourth
circuit
had
done.
and
it's
not
a
question
where
we
insisted
on
the
test--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--right.
i
understand
your
concern,
justice
kennedy,
but
the
reason
that
we
lodged
the
test
in
this
case
was
because
it
was...
this
was
not
something
that
we
did.
this
is
not
a
test
that
we
insisted
on,
and
this
was
not
out
expert.
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
he
argued
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
all
the
way
through
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
he
put--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--he
put
in
his
brief
that
he
was
innocent.
certiorari
was
granted--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
his
position
was
that
the
miscarriage
of
justice
did
apply.
he
put
in
the
certiorari
papers
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
offense--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
conducted
the
review
of
the
actual
innocence,
and
it
does
not
apply.
whether
he
is
relying
on
it
at
all,
the
court
would
still
have
to
conduct
the
review,
as
i
understand
the
analysis.
the
district
court
in
this
case--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--that's
certainly
true.
the
district
court
has
already,
despite
his
default,
has
looked
at
the
merits
of
all
of
his
claims,
including
all
of
his
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims,
and
has
determined
that
they
are
all
without
merit.
it's
the
same
view
reached
by
the
state
habeas
judge.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
about
harris
v.
reed?
mr.
donald
r.
curry
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i'll
address
that
now.
i
was
going
to
address
it
last,
but
i
can
address
it
now.
the
fundamental
flaw
in
his
argument
is
that
the
plain
statement
rule
just
simply
doesn't
apply
unless
it
can
reasonably
be
determined
that
the
state
court
judgment
rested
on
federal
law.
the
court
has
always
applied
the
rule
in
that
manner
and
should
continue
to
apply
it.
and
that
just
simply
didn't
occur
here.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
what
that
is
referring
to,
justice
o'connor,
is
the...
the
practice
of
when
a
petitioner
in
subsequent
habeas
corpus
proceedings
comes
back
and
alleges
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
appeal
through
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
in
that
situation
delayed
appeals
are
granted
usually
upon
our
confession
of
error,
when
the
constitutional
right
to
effective
assistance
applies.
those
are
all
direct
appeal
cases.
but
in
this
case
the
time
limit
for
a
notice
of
appeal
under
virginia
law
is
clearly
jurisdictional.
and
as
justice--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--yes,
it
is
a
court-made
rule.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
yes,
they
have
repeatedly
said
that
it
is.
and
there
is
a
distinction
between
notices
of
appeal
and
petitions
for
appeal.
for
petitions
for
appeal
there,
in
criminal
cases
there
is
a
possibility
of
up
to
a
30-day
extension.
but
there
is
no
extension
for
notices
of
appeal.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
the
rule--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--the
rule
itself
says
that
it's...
rule
55
says
that
the
rule
is
mandatory.
and
the
cases
that
i
cited
in
the
brief
have,
both
before
and
after
coleman's
case,
vaughn
v.
vaughn,
mears
v.
mears,
and
the
school
board
of
lynchburg
v.
caudill
rowlett
scott,
says
that
if
you
violate
one
of
these
jurisdictional
rules
and
the
result
every
time
is
dismissal.
no
matter
what
he
argued
in
state
court,
the
fact
of
the
matter
remains
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
based
solely
on
his
violation
of
that
jurisdictional
rule,
and
the
court
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss.
they
expressly
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
without
so
much
as
discussing,
let
alone
deciding,
his
federal
claims.
and
it's
clear
under
virginia
law
that
the
order
would
have
been
different
if
the
court
had
reached
and
decided
the
federal
merits.
the
practice
under
virginia
law
is
to
say
that
the
petition
for
appeal
is
refused
when
it's
an
affirmance
of
the
lower
court's
decision.
but
a
motion
to
dismiss,
when
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
based
solely
on
a
violation
of
procedural
rule,
there
is
no
other
reasonable
conclusion
than
that
that
is
for
the
procedural
reason.
it
was
these
facts
that
led...
compelled
coleman
when
he
was
last
before
this
court
in
1987,
the
certiorari
proceeding
after
the
virginia
supreme
court
dismissal,
he
told
this
court
at
that
time
that
the
dismissal
was
solely
for
procedural
reasons.
it
would
be
very
strange
indeed,
having
cited
the
o'brien
case
to
the
virginia
supreme
court,
to
come
up
here
and
he
asks
this
court
to
order
the
virginia
supreme
court
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
very
same
claims
that
he
is
now
telling
the
court
today
that
the
court
had
already
decided.
i
think
it
comes
down
to
whether...
as
to
what
the
practice
in
virginia
is,
mr.
hall
hasn't
cited
any
cases
where
they
have
ever
excused
a
late
notice
of
appeal,
as
opposed
to
what
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
district
court,
who
are
experts
in
virginia
law,
said
happened
in
this
case.
and
they
both
said
that
it
was
solely
for
the
procedural
reason.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
no,
that
is
not
correct.
the
case--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--the
case
just
went
in
due
course.
he
had
already
filed
his
brief
on
the
merits
before
i
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss,
because
there
is
nothing
pending
before
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
until
the
petition
for
appeal
is
filed.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
i
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
pleadings
went
back
and
forth
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
i
filed
my
brief
on
the
merits
in
due
course,
but
they
never
asked
for
it.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
because
i
had
no...
i
had
no
choice
but
to
file...
if
you're
going
to
file
a
brief
on
the
merits--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
that's
certainly
true.
but
if
i
was
ever
going
to
address
the
merits
i
had
to
do
it
before
the
time
limit
set
by
the
rule
expired.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
i
don't
see
anything--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
i
don't
see
anything
unreasonable
about--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--that
is
certainly
true,
justice
stevens.
i
filed
a
brief
on
the
merits.
but
the
length
of
time
that
they
took,
i
mean,
you
have
to
realize
what
he
was
arguing
in
the
virginia
supreme
court.
what
he
was
arguing
primarily
was
that
the
state's
interpretation
of
when
judgment
is
entered
was
wrong,
and
that
his
notice
of
appeal
was
not
timely.
that's
what
the
court
was
sorting
out.
but
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
no
matter
what
was
argued,
the
fact
remains
that
it
was
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
was
granted.
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
based
solely
on
procedural
law.
but,
as
i
said,
the
district
court
and
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
as
i
said,
i
don't
think
you
can
read
much
into
it
other
than
they
just
got
to
it
in
due
course.
but
the
primary...
primary
issue
they
had
to
sort
through
was
his
contention
that
judgment
had
been
entered
under--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--virginia
law
at
a
later
date.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
and
that
his
notice
of
appeal
was
timely.
but
as
i
said,
the
district
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
had
no
difficulty...
if
it
comes
to
understanding
what
virginia
law
is
and
what
the
practice
is,
they
had
no
difficulty
realizing
that
under
these
circumstances
the
dismissal
was
solely
for
procedural
reasons.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
true.
there
would
be
no
question,
but--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--that's
right.
the
time
they
considered
it
would
have
made
no
difference
at
all.
i
do
want
to
address
the
issue
of
whether
cause
for
a
procedural
default
based
on
habeas
attorney
error
can
be
cause,
and
in
our
view
the
discussion
should
really
begin
and
end
with
this
court's
decisions
in
finley
and
in
giarratano,
and
with
coleman's
concession
that
he
is
not
challenging
the
rule
in
those
cases
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
counsel
in
collateral
proceedings.
because
what
he
is
asking
for
in
this
case
is
nothing
short
of
the
practical
equivalent
of
exactly
what
finley
and
giarratano
say
is
not
required,
the
effective
assistance
of
habeas
counsel.
and
while
he
pays
lip
service
to
those
precedents,
what
he
is
actually
trying
to
do
is
make
an
end
run
around
them
by
arguing
that
well,
yes,
i
don't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel,
but
if
the
states
want
to
enforce
their
default
rules
in
those
proceedings,
which
he
concedes
are
legitimate,
if
they
want
to
enforce
the
default
rules
and
if
they
want
to
have
them
respected
by
the
federal
courts,
then
they
must
provide
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
and
if
there
was
ever
any
doubt
that
that's
what
his
position
is,
his
reply
brief
dispelled
it,
because
that's
exactly
what
he
says
he
is
looking
for.
and
if
that
argument
were
correct,
then
in
practical
terms
the
decisions
in
finley
and
giarratano
would
be
very
hollow.
but
it's
not
correct,
because
what
the
constitution
doesn't
require
of
the
states
at
the
front
door
can't
be
required
of
the
states
by
going
through
the
back
door.
not
only
would
accepting
his
definition
of
cause
overrule
finley
and
giarratano
for
all
practical
purposes,
but
it
would
also
produce
adverse
consequences
which
our
system
just
couldn't
bear.
and
in
practical
terms,
the
very
real
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
is
going
to
authorize
an
entirely...
another
layer
of
review
on
top
of
everything
we
now
have,
a
layer
of
review
devoted
to
litigating
the
effectiveness
of
habeas
counsel.
if
the
court
were
to
recognize
that
an
error
by
a
habeas
attorney
could
constitute
cause,
then
no
doubt
what
you
would
end
up
with
is
a
system
of
collateral
review
where
each
layer
of
habeas
counsel
would
say
that
the
last
habeas
counsel
had
been
ineffective.
and
i
think
you
can
see
that
finality,
any
reasonable
concept
of
finality,
would
quickly
become
a
farce,
because--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
but,
you
know,
what
you're
assuming
is
that
you
would
have
different
counsel
between
state
and
federal
habeas,
like
you
have
in
this
case.
and
you
certainly
wouldn't
have
that
normally,
and
nor
should
you
want
it.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
justice
stevens,
i
have
just
never
heard
of
a
situation
where
counsel
can
go
into
a
proceeding
and
attempt
to
excuse
a
default
based
on
his
own
alleged
ineffectiveness.
the
state
has
virtually
no
way
to
combat
that.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
but
as
a
practical
matter
that's
not
going
to
happen.
what's
going
to
happen
is...
in
the
context
of
habeas
corpus
proceedings
you're
going
to
have
the
same
counsel
all
the
way
through
state
and
federal
proceedings.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
and
then
it's
going
to
take
new
counsel
and
a
new
petition
to
say
that
the
original
habeas
attorneys
were
ineffective
in
not
raising
specified
claims.
that's,
that's
exactly
what
his
rule
would
require.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
even,
even
under
coleman's
rule
there
would
be
nothing
in
his
case
to
prevent
subsequent
counsel
from
coming
back...
under
the
rule
as
he
has
formulated
it...
from
coming
back
and
in
another
proceeding
alleging
that
first
and
second
habeas
counsel
were
ineffective
in
not
raising
ineffective
counsel
claims
that
we
haven't
heard
of
yet.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
carrier
decided
that
in
terms
of
the
costs
to
the
interest
that
we're
concerned
about,
finality,
comity,
and
federalism,
the
costs
are
the
same
regardless
of
whether
the
error
is
based
on
a
tactical
decision,
inadvertence,
negligence,
whatever.
the
result
to
the
state's
interest
are
the
same.
the
state
has
avowed
interest
in
enforcing
its
default
rules,
in
defining
its
appellate
jurisdiction
with
some
certainly
as
to
time.
it
has
an
interest
in
taking
seriously
its
responsibility
to
being
the
court
in
the
first
instance
to
deal
with
constitutional
error.
and
it
has
an
interest
in,
if
a
retrial
is
to
be
granted
in
the
case,
to
have
it
occur
as
proximate
to
the
offense
as
possible.
all
three
of
those
interests
apply
here,
and
they
would,
none
of
them
would
be
protected
under
the
test
that
mr.
coleman
is
advocating.
the
only
way
to
protect
those
interests
is
the
balancing
of
those
interests
in
the
context
of
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard.
the...
if
the
court
were
ever
to
say
that
habeas
attorney
error
was
cause,
something
that
the
court
would
also
have
to
consider
and
would
almost
certainly
have
to
grant
would
be
a
similar
form
of
cause
for
pro
se
habeas
petitioners,
who
make
up
the
great
bulk
of
habeas
corpus
litigants,
some
similar
form
of
cause
based
on
their
alleged
ineffectiveness.
and
i
don't
think
it
takes
a
whole
lot
of
imagination
to
foresee
all
the
endless
variation
of
that
type
of
claim,
or
a
lot
of
foresight
to
realize
that
that's
a
can
of
worms
that
the
court
should
do
everything
possible
to
avoid
opening.
in
harris
v.
reed
i
came
across
the
statistics
for
the
number
of
federal
habeas
petitions
filed
by
state
prisoners,
and
if
you
update
the
statistics
you
see
that
the
numbers
are
still
growing.
just
in
the
year
that
ended
in
june
of
'90,
11,000
habeas
petitions
were--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
i'm
sure
the
court's
aware
of
it.
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
if
the
court
endorses
coleman's
definition
of
cause,
whether
you
relate
it
to
the
appeal,
or
individual
claims,
or
at
the
habeas
trial
level,
or
what,
you
can
just
imagine
how
those
figures
are
going
to
explode
if
every
habeas
petitioner
whose
case
is
now
at
an
end
could
go
back
and
file
another
petition
based
upon
his
own
alleged
ineffectiveness
or
the
alleged
ineffectiveness
of
himself,
of
his
writ
writer,
or
whatever.
in
conclusion,
again
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
petitioner's
guilt,
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
his
offense
to
support
a
death
sentence,
and
because
in
this
case
there
is
no
danger
that
denying
him
further
federal
review
would
result
in
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
thank
you.
