justice
scalia
they
didn't
know
about
harris
at
the
time,
did
they?
justice
scalia
it
makes
a
difference,
don't
you
think?
justice
scalia
no,
i
think
you
would
have
a
much
stronger
case
if
we
had
said
that
you
have
to
have
an,
you
know,
express
indication,
and
after
we
said
that
the
virginia
court
came
down
with
this,
which
as
you
say
is
arguably
not
express.
you
could
make
the
argument,
to
follow
harris
all
they
had
to
do
was
say
expressly.
but
harris
hadn't
been
issued
yet--
justice
scalia
mr.
hall,
do
you
take
it
that
our
cases
absolutely
prohibit
us
from
saying
that
a
state
can
sometimes
look
at
the
merits
and
exceptionally
decide
to
receive
a
pleading
even
though
it's
late
because
the
merits
look
so
bad,
even
though
in
other
cases
it
simply
follows
its
normal
procedures
and
dismisses
for
lateness?
justice
scalia
well,
what
if,
what
if
you
just
have
a
rule
that
we'll
always
look
at
the
merits,
but
ordinarily,
almost
invariably
we'll
follow
the
time
limit
set
forth
in
our
statute.
however,
if
in
looking
at
the
merits
we
see
a
case
that
is
really...
it's
clear
that
an
injustice
is
being
done,
we
then
will
reach
the
merits
despite
our
normal
procedural
rules.
do
you
think
that
a
state
could
not
adopt
that?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
is
it
clear
to
you
that
that
is
not
what
virginia
is
doing
here?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
did
they
ask
for...
i
thought
that
they
asked
for
the
briefing
on
the
merits.
did
they
ask
for
the
briefing
on
the
merits?
justice
scalia
it
was
not
asked
for.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
mr.
hall,
what's
your
response
to
the
fact
that
the
last
time
this
case
was
up
here
you
argued
that
in
fact
the
virginia
supreme
court's
dismissal
was
a
procedural
dismissal?
justice
scalia
do
you
feel
bad
about
switching
on
us
like
that?
justice
scalia
well,
all
right.
