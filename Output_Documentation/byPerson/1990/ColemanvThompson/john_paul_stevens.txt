justice
stevens
general
curry,
can
i
interrupt
with
another
question?
justice
stevens
i
didn't
understand
your
opponent
to
be
arguing
that
this
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice
case.
i
thought
he
argued
there
was
no
procedural
default,
and
if
there
was
it
was
excused
by
cause.
justice
stevens
but
i
don't
think
he
has
here.
justice
stevens
am
i
not
correct?
justice
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
he
has
not
argued
that
as
a
separate
ground
for
reversing
the
court
of
appeals.
his
argument
is
that
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
doesn't
apply
because
there
was
no
procedural...
the
order
was
ambiguous,
and
secondly,
if
it
was
there
was
cause
because
the
counsel
goofed.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
he
also
pleaded
not
guilty,
but
we're
not
going
to
argue
again
the
original
facts,
are
we?
i
mean,
i
just
don't
see
how
that
bears
on
the
issues
he
has
brought
here
and
we
have
agreed
to
review.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
justice
stevens
well,
we
wouldn't
if
he
won
on
one
of
the
other
grounds
which
we
reach
first.
justice
stevens
if
the
law
is
as
clear
as
you
say
it
is,
why
did
you
bother
to
file
a
brief?
justice
stevens
what
do
you
mean
you
had
no
choice?
the
case
was...
you
had
an
absolute
right
to
have
the
case
dismissed,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
stevens
but
you
didn't
have
to.
it's
perfectly
clear
you
didn't
have
to.
justice
stevens
actions
sometimes
speak
louder
than
words.
justice
stevens
there's
nothing
unreasonable
it,
but
apparently
you
were
not
confident
that
the
case
would
be
dismissed
as
untimely,
and
therefore,
as
a
good
lawyer
should,
you
protected
yourself
by
filing
a
brief
on
the
merits.
justice
stevens
the
other
thing
that's
puzzling
is
why
would
it
take
the
supreme
court
4
months
to
decide
such
a
simple
motion?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
stevens
yeah,
right.
justice
stevens
general
curry,
i
don't
really
understand
that
argument,
because
the
facts
are
rather
clear...
i
mean,
there
isn't
a
dispute
about
the
fact
that
it
was
an
attorney
error
that
caused
the
failure
to
make
a
timely
appeal.
isn't
that
undisputed?
justice
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
why...
you
either
decide
that's
a
sufficient
cause
or
it
isn't.
i
don't
know
why
that
requires
an
additional
layer
of
review.
justice
stevens
i
guess
your
position
it
is
not
sufficient
cause
unless
the
counsel
was
unconstitutionally
ineffective,
that's
what
you--
justice
stevens
--yeah.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
you'd
have
to
have
different
counsel.
why
couldn't
the
same
counsel
say
i
made
the
mistake.
i'm
not...
i
don't
think
i
was
constitutionally
ineffective,
but
it
was
an
innocent
error
that
caused
me
to
be
a
day
late
on
the
appeal,
and
that
should
be
a
sufficient
cause
for
waiving
this
procedural
argument?
justice
stevens
well,
it
happens
all
the
time
in
late
appeal
situations.
you
come
in
and
you
argue
excusable
neglect
of
some
kind
or
another.
it's,
you're
not
saying
you're
constitutionally
ineffective,
you're
saying
there
is
a
reason
that
should
not
bar
review
of
the
merits
of
the
claim.
that's
all.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
if
you
go
to
a
failure
to
raise
specified
claims,
i
would
agree
with
you.
but
i'm
talking
about
something
as
mechanical
as
this,
the
lawyer
missed
the
filing
date
by
1
day.
i
don't
know
why
the
lawyer
who
missed
it
couldn't
also
argue
that
that
should
not
be
a
sufficient
ground
for
denying
review
of
an
otherwise
meritorious
constitutional
claim.
justice
stevens
no,
i
agree
with
you.
there's
a
vast
difference
in
my
judgment
between
ineffectiveness
in
the
sense
of
trial
strategy
and
deciding
what
claims
to
raise,
and
so
forth.
i
think
your
argument
has
great
force
in
that
context.
but
when
we've
got
an
obvious
error,
maybe
the
secretary
lost
the...
it
isn't
true
in
this
case,
but
something
mechanical
of
that
kind,
then
it's
quite
a
different
case.
there's
no
question
of
judgment
involved,
it's
just
a
mechanical
error.
justice
stevens
tell
us
about
it.
