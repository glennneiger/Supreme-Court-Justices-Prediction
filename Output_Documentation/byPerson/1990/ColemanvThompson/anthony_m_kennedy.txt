justice
kennedy
well,
i
don't
read
o'brien
as
being
a
late
filing
case.
and
the
other
cases--
justice
kennedy
--well...
but
that's
different
under
virginia
law.
and
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
a
failure
to
file
a
timely
notice
of
appeal,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
kennedy
and
the
notice
of
appeal
precedes
by
some
60
days
the
date
when
the
petition
for
the
appeal
is
due.
and
those...
the
cases
you
cite
in
your
brief
refer
to
petitions.
but
the
notice
is
jurisdictional.
justice
kennedy
it's
an
odd
calculus
that
you're
suggesting,
that
is
to
say
if
there
is
a
well-established
federal
right
under
the...
your
plain
error
discussion,
you
assume
the
state
relied
on
a
procedural
ground.
but
if
it's
not
a
well
established
procedural
right,
you're
assuming
that
it,
that
it
looked
at
that
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
if
you
had
it
exactly
upside
down.
justice
kennedy
was
that
part
of
the
record
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
think
that
it's
inappropriate
for
you
to
proceed
on
that
basis.
justice
kennedy
lots
of
things
outside
the
record
corroborate
something
courts
have
done.
justice
kennedy
is
that
a
court-made
rule?
justice
kennedy
and
why
is
it
jurisdictional?
has
the
supreme
court
said
that
it
is?
