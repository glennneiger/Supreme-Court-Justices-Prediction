mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
may
19,
1987,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
in
an
order
that
appears
at
page
25
and
26
of
the
joint
appendix,
issued
a
decision
dismissing
the
appeal
of
roger
keith
coleman
on
the
ground
that
it
had
been
filed
1
day
late.
when
one
examines
the
face
of
this
order,
one
immediately
sees
that
it
is
an
ambiguous
order.
the
issues
of
federal
law
that
mr.
coleman
had
asserted
in
the
circuit
court
below
were
the
subject
of
extensive
briefing
before
the
virginia
supreme
court.
and
in
fact
in
response
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
as
untimely,
mr.
coleman's
opposition
motion
adverted
to
the
merits
below,
the
merits
that
were
covered
below
and
were
to
be
the
subject
of
later
briefing,
and
informed
the
court
of
its
authority
under
existing
virginia
case
law
to
consider
the
merits
to
inform
its
judgment
as
to
whether
the
appeal
could
be...
the
lateness
of
the
appeal
could
be
excused.
it
is
on
this
basis
that
we
submit
one
must
apply
the
harris...
reed
against
harris...
or
excuse
me,
harris
against
reed
test
to
determine
whether
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
rested
on
an
independent
state
procedural
ground.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
the
use
of
the
word
dismissal
alone
is
unusual
based
upon
our
examination
of
virginia
cases.
there
are
several
cases
cited
in
the
party's
briefs
in
which
the
court
has
stated
appeal
dismissed,
federal...
the
merits
of
the
claim
are
therefore
not
reached.
that
articulation
is
a
clear
and
express
statement
of
reliance
on
state
law
and
would
meet
the
harris
test.
but
that
further
statement
was
not
made.
in
addition
in
this
case,
i
think
unlike,
certainly
unlike
any
of
the
other
reported
cases
we
have
seen,
the
reference
in
the
order
itself
to
the
party's
submissions
with
respect
to
the
merits
and
then
the
closing
language
of
the
order
which
states
"upon
consideration
whereof",
thereby
it
seems
to
me
unambiguously
referring
to
all
of
the
papers
submitted.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
it
strikes
me,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
are,
in
any
kind
of
order
like
this,
particularly
a
procedural
bar
in
a
summary,
basically
summary
order,
there
are
a
number
of
possibilities.
there
are
at
least
two
where
the
court's
decision
could
be
informed
by
a
reference
to
federal
law.
one
is
the
ake
kind
of
situation,
where
the
court
in
effect
makes
a
determination,
in
fact
does
make
a
determination
of
federal
law,
determines
the
federal
claims
to
be
without
merit,
and
therefore
dismisses
on
the
state
grounds.
there
is
nothing
in
this
order
that
tells
us
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
the
case
of
o'brien
against
socony
mobil,
decided
by
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
1967,
involved
an
analysis
of
precisely
that
kind.
the
court,
there
examining
constitutional
property
rights,
reviewed
the
record
and
made
a
determination
which
it
described
as
a
holding,
the
court
said
held
that
there
was
no
deprivation
of
constitutional
property
rights,
therefore
this
court
need
not
meet,
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
late
filing
default
should
be
excused.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
it's
not
a
late
filing.
it's
a
failure
to
perfect.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i
don't
believe,
justice
kennedy,
that
that
notion,
that
distinction
between
jurisdiction
and
a
mandatory
rule
is
sustainable
under
virginia
practice.
as
i
understand
the
practice,
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
that
petitions
be
filed
within
4
months
of
the
date
that
triggers
the
need
to
perfect
an
appeal.
there
is
a
court
rule
without
a
statutory
basis,
a
court
rule
which
is
deemed
mandatory,
which
is
called
mandatory,
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
court
rule
which
sets
the
time
for
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
and
that's
rule
5.9,
which
is
referred
to
in
the
party's
cases.
so
although
i
would
agree
generally
with
the
proposition
that
one
thinks
of
a
notice
of
appeal
as
a
jurisdictional
event
and
the
timely
filing
of
briefs
or
doing
other
things
to
perfect
the
appeal
as
being
different
in
character
and
perhaps
things
which
courts
more
typically
will
extend
the
time
on,
i
don't
believe
that
the
virginia
practice
supports
that
specifically.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
the
closest
i
come
to
that
is
socony,
and
the
analysis
of
socony.
now,
there
are
other
virginia
supreme
court
cases
in
which
the
virginia
supreme
court
indicates
that
it
has
authority
to
at
least
modify
the
perfection
portion
of
the
rules
so
that
it
would
be
in
a
position
to
allow
a
petitioner
to
file
a
late
brief
or
petition
on
appeal.
but
there
is
not
a
case
that
specifically
holds
that
the
court
has
authority
with
respect
to
a
late
notice,
but
it
is
a
court-made
rule.
this
is
not
a
statutory
requirement.
the
best
evidence,
i
submit,
is
the
actual
practice
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
this
case,
because
what
we
have
here
is
the
state
taking
the
position
that
the
appeal
is
late,
therefore
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
dismiss
the
appeal.
and
they
make
that
motion
to
the
court.
in
opposition,
in
opposition
the
petitioner
makes
out
the
case
that
there
is
room.
instead
of
deciding
that
motion
to
dismiss
on
a
preliminary
basis,
the
court
takes
merits
briefs
and
takes
4
months
with
the
merits
briefs,
and
then
enters
an
order
which
refers
to
all
the
papers
and
doesn't
clarify
the
basis
for
the
ruling.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
submit,
though,
that
ake
is
a
kind
of
case
that
presents
exactly
that
issue,
and
the
practice
of
the
virginia
supreme
court,
as
revealed
in
the
tharp
case,
which
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
recognized
that
it
had
been
perhaps
too
lenient
in
excusing
its
mandatory
rules,
and
the
socony
mobil
case,
o'brien
against
socony
mobil,
is
precisely
that
kind
of
case
where
the
court
recognizes
that
it
can
look
through
to
the
merits
and
inform
its
procedural
decision
on
that
basis.
that
is
what
happened
in
ake,
although
ake
is
not
a
summary
order
case
so
that
one
could
go
to
state
law
and
one
could
find
a
clearer
answer.
one
can't
do
that
here.
i
agree
with
that,
but
this
order
on
its
face
does
advert
to
the
federal
merits,
to
the
briefs
dealing
with
the
federal
merits,
and
the
practice
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
been
to,
in
some
cases,
not
in
all
cases...
this
is
not
something
that
happens
in
every
case
and
we
cannot
sustain
that
argument...
but
in
some
cases
it
has
done
this.
it
has
recognized
its
jurisdiction
to
do
it.
and
under
harris,
given
this
record,
the
court,
to
make
clear
that
federal
jurisdiction
is
going
to,
not
going
to
obtain,
is
required
to
give
a
clear
and
express
statement
of
reliance
on
state
law,
which
it
doesn't.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
we
are
not
making
an
adequacy
argument
in
that
sense.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that
is
correct.
if
i
might
just
expand
slightly
on
this
point,
the...
there
is
another
area
where
this
kind
of
issue
comes
up,
and
that
is
in
plain
error
assessments
that
state
supreme
courts
often
do
in
connection
with
the
review
of
decisions
that
involve
procedural
bars
of
various
kinds.
that
plain
error
analysis
is
a
harder
case
than
the
kind
of
case
that
is
set
out
in
o'brien
against
socony,
because
often
the
plain
error,
and
typically
the
plain
error
analysis
involves
an
assumption
that
the
federal
grounds
have
validity,
and
then
an
inquiry
is
made
into
state
law,
on
a
state
law
basis
to
determine
whether
there
is
prejudice.
we
don't
argue,
and
don't
believe
that
the
virginia
practice
shows
that
that
kind
of
inquiry
was
made
here.
rather,
it
was
an
ake
kind
of
inquiry
that
informed
the
procedural
decision.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
close
on
the
harris
point
by
just
emphasizing
again
how
easy
it
would
have
been
for
the
virginia
supreme
court
to
state
what
the
commonwealth
now
says
the
virginia
supreme
court
intended
to
say.
all
it
had
to
say
was
that
we
have...
we
do
not
reach
the
federal
merits
because
this
claim
is
barred
by
the
appellant's
1-day
late
filing.
any
number
of
articulations
around
that
point
would
have
been
adequate
to
meet
harris.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
that's
true,
and--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so.
i
really
don't,
because
the
question
here
is
not
being
fair,
if
you
will,
to
the
virginia
supreme
court,
but
rather
trying
to
figure
out
what
it
meant.
and
to
say
that
they
would
have
used
the
precise
harris
articulation
is
to
assume
the
answer
to
the
question
that's
before
us.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
but
long
had
been
issued,
and
the
general
notion
of
the
requirement
for
a
plain
statement
was
in
existence.
so
that
it
doesn't
come
as
a
total
surprise...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that's
correct.
so...
and
there
are
different
values
implicated
in
that
exercise
of
jurisdiction
to
establish
uniformity
of
federal
law
and
questions
like
that
than
there
are
in
the
procedural
default
area
where
what
you're
doing
is
you're
cutting
off
access
to
the
federal
courts
to
a
petitioner
who
has
lost
his
rights
in
a
situation
where
there
is
some
indication
that
the
federal
merits
were
reached.
and
in
harris
the
court
considered
whether
those
differences
should
lead
to
a
different
rule.
in
fact
an
opposite
presumption
which
justice
kennedy
suggested
was
the
appropriate
presumption.
the
court
rejected
that
idea
of
having
a
presumption,
which
i
think
is
the
effect
of
what
the
state
is
asking
or
the
commonwealth
is
asking
to
be
done
here,
that
is
a
presumption
when
the
order
is
unclear,
you
assume
that
state
law
does
provide
an
adequate
and
independent
ground.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i
think
there
is
a
basis
for
a
distinction
in
following
a
plain
error
kind
of
analysis,
where
a
state
establishes
a
rule
of
state
law
that
is
based
on
the
concepts
of
prejudice
or
harmless
error
under
state
law
that
would
permit
it
to
do
that.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
is
actually
looking
at
federal
law
and
doesn't
do
that
in
all
the
cases,
or
does
that
in
a
crazy
fashion,
then
i
think
there's
an
adequacy
problem
that
could
be
raised
by
the
application,
and
in
particular...
in
any
particular
case.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
lots
of
states
do
have
that
rule,
and
i
think
it's
a
plain
error
rule,
and
i
believe
that
there
is
a
good
basis
for
saying
that
the
federal
merits
were
not
decided
in
a
case
like
that.
in
any
of
those
cases,
except
in
the
one
in
which
it
was
actually
decided.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
but
it
wasn't
decided
in
the
others
because
there
is
a
state...
what
basically
it
does
is
it
assumes
the
validity
of
the
federal
claim
and
then
inquires
into
prejudice
or
extraordinary
circumstances
or
something
that
at
least
intellectually
is
separate
from
the
federal
merits.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
o'brien
against
socony
doesn't
follow
that
kind
of
analysis.
now,
that's
my
best
information.
i
don't
see
a
case
that
follows
what
i
would
call
the
plain
error
kind
of
approach
that
this
court
has
seen
in
other...
in
other
cases.
in
o'brien
the
court
says
we
hold
that
there
has
not
been
no
deprivation
of
federal
constitutional
property
rights,
therefore
we
have
no
reason
to
consider
whether
there
should
be
an...
whether
we
should
have
a
rule
that
would
permit
excuses.
that's
a
ruling
on
federal
law.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
the
circumstance
which
would
cause
the
state
court
to
limit
itself
in
terms
of
its
harmless
error.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
there
is
a
default
which
under
the
state
rules
bars
hearing
of
the
federal
claim,
whether
this
be
a
speculative
federal
claim
or
one
that
is
well
established.
and
if
the
state
court
says
if
we
assume
this
is
a
violation
we
will
then
look
at
whether
there
is
prejudice,
whether
the
essential
fairness
of
the
proceeding
has
been
so
infected
that
we
should,
in
spite
of
our
procedural
rule,
look
at
this,
that's
a...
that
can
fairly,
i
think,
be
characterized
as
a
state
law
inquiry.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
let
me
do
that.
i'd
like
to
proceed,
because
i
think
there's
some
logic
to
do
it,
to
the
third
one
before
the
second
one.
and
that
is
the
question
of
a
continued
viability
of
fay
against
noia
in
connection
with
surrenders
of
rights
to
an
entire
line
of
proceeding.
there's
a
difference
between
this
case
and
the
fay
against
noia
kind
of
surrender,
in
that
the
fay,
that
noia's
surrender
was
of
direct
appeal
rights
which
barred
him
from
collateral
review,
which
barred
him
from
federal
court,
absent
the
decision
of
this
court
to
allow
him
to
enter
federal
court
because
that
was
not
a
procedural
by-pass.
but
we
submit
that
this
distinction
is
not
one...
first
it's
not
one
that
has
yet
been
resolved
by
the
court.
it
was
expressly
left
open
in
wainwright
against
sykes,
referred
to
again
as
open
in
murray
against
carrier,
and
the
logic
of
sykes
for
determining
the
areas
where
noia
presented
problems
and
therefore
was
leading
to
various
kinds
of
mischief
with
respect
to
defaults,
but
that
doesn't
apply
in
this
kind
of
situation.
and
there
are
basically
four
factors
that
one
looks
at
in
looking
at
that.
first
is
comity,
and
the
question
is
whether
state
rules
ought
to
be
given
their
just
desserts.
and
there's
no
question
here
that
this
is
a
state...
if
there
is
a
default,
this
is
a
state
rule.
it's,
the
state
is
entitled
to
have
rules,
and
one
really
can't
quarrel
with
that.
but
when
you
look
down
to
questions
of
finality
accuracy
and
the
integrity
of
the
trial
itself,
the
concerns
that
led
to
sykes
are
quite
attenuated,
if
indeed
they
exist.
on
the
question
of
finality,
the
finality
that
we're
upsetting
here,
that
we're
worried
about,
is
not
really
the
trial
court
finality.
it's
the
finality
of
a
decision
to
bar
state
collateral
review.
the
state
has
already
permitted
an
extended
period
for
the
review
of
its
criminal
convictions.
the
fact
that
a
federal
court
can
look
through
that
default
does
not
really
extend
the
period
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
finality
of
the
trial.
now
it
does,
at
least
potentially,
and
maybe
this
case
attests
to
it,
stretch
out
the
time
between
the
final
decision
in
the
federal
courts
and
the
date
on
which
the
trial
was
commenced.
but
the
finality
determination
of
the
state
court
on
state
habeas
is
really
the
thing
that
ought
to
be
the
focus
of
inquiry.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i
don't--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--the
argument
for
doing
that,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
requires
an
evaluation
of
these,
of
the
characteristics
that
led
to
a
departure
of
the
deliberate
by-pass
standard
that
was
in
place
before
wainwright
against
sykes.
the
question
of
whether
noia
is
abandoned
entirely
is
before
the
court
at
least
in
part
in
this
case,
this
is
one
step
from
overruling
noia,
but
it
is
a
reserved
area
because
this
is
a
surrender
of
all
rights.
it's
not
picking
and
choosing
claims.
it's
not
contemporaneous
objection.
it's
not
an
abandonment
of
individual
issues
on
appeal,
or
for
that
matter
on
habeas
corpus.
it's
the
whole
thing
as
a
result
of
a
colossal
error.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
sound
basis
for
distinction
just
in
terms
of
ease
of
decision
making,
in
terms
of
fairness,
in
terms
of
avoiding
the
problems
that
i
think
created
the
legitimate
cause
and
prejudice
rule
which,
which
deals
with
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
usually
committed
to
counsel
which
counsel's
discretion
and
tactical
judgments,
et
cetera,
are
applied
to,
and
which
are
very
hard
to
look
at
after
the
fact,
and
certainly
very
hard
to
look
at
after
the
fact
through
the
eyes
of,
of
the
defendant.
i
asked
to
reserve
5
minutes,
and
i
see
i
have
already
encroached
on
that.
let
me...
let
me
stop
at
this
point,
your
honor.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
yes,
briefly.
let
me
first
address
just
for
a
moment
the
virginia
law
issue,
because
i
think
it's
important.
in
the
case
of
mears
against
mears,
143
s.e.
2d
889,
the
court
stated,
"in
dismissing
an
appeal,
we
do
not
reach
the
merits
of
this
appeal.
"
"the
motion
to
dismiss
must
be
sustained.
"
that
works
under
harris.
it
could
have
been
done
here.
that's
what
the
virginia
supreme
court--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--that
is
a
pre-harris
order.
it's
a
1965
case.
in
the
case
of
vaughn
against
vaughn,
the
court
states
on
this
jurisdictional
mandatory
point
something
directly
opposite
from
what
mr.
curry
said.
it
states
petitions
for
appeal
must
be
presented
within
4
months
following
final
judgment.
that
rule
is
jurisdictional.
it
refers
to
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
within
30
days
after
the
entry
of
final
judgment.
it
says
that
rule,
like
its
predecessor,
is
mandatory...
a
significant
distinction,
it
appears,
under
virginia
law.
the
4
month
is
jurisdictional,
the
shorter
period
for
the
notice,
mandatory,
made
by
a
court
rule,
can
be
extended.
on
the
question
of
cause
and
whether
we
are
attempting
to
set
up
an
apparatus
which
requires
the
full
panoply
of
due
process
rights
within
the
state
system,
that
is
not
the
rule
we
propose.
the
only
rule
we
propose
is
that
access
to
federal
court
not
be
barred
by
a
procedural
default
in
circumstances
where
the
petitioner
has
not
had
a
fair
opportunity
to
get
his
claims
through
the
state
system.
and
that's
what
happened
here.
there
was
a
gross
error
by
counsel
that
denied
roger
coleman
the
opportunity
to
get
his
case
through
the
federal
system--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
missing
the
boat,
where
your
client
wants
you
to
file
and
you
make
a
mistake
of
this
kind,
that's
right.
this
error,
which
swept
away
the
opportunity
to
get
into
federal
court,
if
indeed
that's
what
it
did,
is
that
kind
of
error,
and
it
is
within
the
discretion
under
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
or
another
standard
where
the
court
could
try
to
adopt
one
that
was
narrower
to
allow
that
court
into
federal
court.
we're
talking
here
about
the
exercise
of
discretion
on
habeas
corpus.
it's
not
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
but
whether
the
federal
courts
will
allow
those
cases
to
be
heard.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
the
argument
there
was--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that...
i
didn't
argue
that
particular--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--point,
but
that's
neither
here
nor
there.
the
point
is
that
when
this
case
was
dismissed
you
couldn't
tell
from
the
order
what
was
intended
by
the
state
court.
therefore,
for
counsel,
in...
as
a
precautionary
matter
to
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
say
please
give
me
an
explicit
ruling
on
the
federal
merits
is
just
good
lawyering.
it's
not
an
admission
of
a
ruling
that
didn't
touch
federal
merits
in
the
way
we
say
that
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
