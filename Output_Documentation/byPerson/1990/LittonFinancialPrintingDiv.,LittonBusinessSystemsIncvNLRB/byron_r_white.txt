justice
white
do
you
think,
then,
even
though
there's
a...
say
after
a
contract
has
expired,
the
employer
is
under
a
duty
to
bargain
about
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions,
but
he
may
unilaterally
change
the...
say,
the
hours
of
work
without
bargaining?
he
can
change
it,
but
he
has
to
bargain--
justice
white
--but
meanwhile
he
can
change?
justice
white
well,
may
he,
while
he's
bargaining
may
be
say
well,
i
know
what...
the
contract
required
8
hours
of
work
or
6
hours
of
work,
i
am
going
to
change
to
7.
i
know
i
have
to
bargain
about
it,
but
until
we
bargain
the
impasse,
it's
going
to
be
8
now?
justice
white
you
agree
with
that?
justice
white
before
you
make
the
change?
justice
white
oh,
i
agree,
i...
that's
a
different
thing
because
your
obligation
to
bargain
to
the
union
isn't
based
on
the
contract.
justice
white
it's
based
on
labor
law.
justice
white
and
so...
and
certainly
the
duty
to
arbitrate
isn't
based
on
labor
law.
it's
based
on
contract.
justice
white
before
he
changes
them?
is
that
it?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
white
of
course
it
did.
but
if...
but
the
duty
to
maintain
the
existing
working
conditions,
wages,
hours,
working
conditions,
doesn't
rest
on
contract.
it
rests
on
the
law?
justice
white
otherwise
you
could
sue
the
employer
for...
under
301
for
breaching
the
contract.
justice
white
and
you
can't?
justice
white
and
you
can't?
justice
white
unless
the
dispute
actually
had
its
roots
in
the
contract.
justice
white
well,
what
about
vacation
pay?
justice
white
what
you're
saying
is
the
dispute
has
its
roots
in
a
contract.
justice
white
what
bargain,
if
it's
expired?
justice
white
namely
those...
did
the
dispute
arise
under
the
contract.
justice
white
well,
just
generally,
mr.
wallace,
wouldn't
you
think
that
if
the
question
is
whether
a
dispute
arises
under
the
contract,
isn't
that
itself
a
issue
for
the
arbitrator?
justice
white
but,
suppose
the
argument
is
that
the
parties
intended
by
this
language
in
the
contract
to
have
a
certain
clause
in
the
contract
carry
over
past
the
normal
expiration
date?
now,
isn't
that
a
question
for
the
arbitrator
as
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
that
provision?
justice
white
well,
you
don't...
you
certainly
don't,
aren't
arguing,
you
don't
need
to
argue
that
every,
an
arbitration
clause
always
survives
the
termination
of
the
contract?
justice
white
if
it's,
if
it's
suit
was
based
on
the
contract.
justice
white
even
though
the
contract
formally
had
expired
you
would
still,
to
bring
a
301
suit
you
would
have
to
say
what
we're
suing
about
is
nevertheless
governed
by
the
expired
contract.
justice
white
you
probably,
certainly
could
have
stated
a
cause
of
action
in
your
complaint,
but
you
might
not
have
won.
justice
white
well,
you're
changing
the
facts
now.
just
throw
that
out.
here's
a
contract
that
expired.
the
wages
were
$100
a
day.
and
6
months
from
then
the
employer
unilaterally
changes
it
to
$90.
justice
white
of
course
not,
you
couldn't.
but
you
could...
well,
next
week
he
does.
you
can...
you
could
certainly
complain,
make
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
that
he
unilaterally
changed
the...
without
bargaining.
justice
white
but
you
couldn't
sue
on
the
contract?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
don't
have
to
prove
something
besides
the
fact
that
he
unilaterally
changed
it.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
so
what
do
you
do
about
the
notion
that
courts
are
to
decide
the,
whether
an
issue
is
arbitrable?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
court
still
has
to
come
down
and
say
we
looked
at
this
arbitration
clause
and
we...
the
court
has
to
say
either
it
reaches
this
dispute
or
it
doesn't.
justice
white
and
did
the
board
do
any
more
than
that
in
this
case?
it
looked
at
the
arbitration
clause,
it
looked
at
everything
in
sight,
and
said
this
particular
issue
isn't
arbitrable.
justice
white
isn't
that
what
it
said?
justice
white
yes.
well,
so
we
have
to
review
that
and
decide
whether
the
board
was
wrong
or
right
in
saying
it
was
not
arbitrable.
justice
white
so
there's
nothing
wrong
with
what,
with
the
kind
of
decision
the
board
made.
you
just
say
they
were
wrong?
justice
white
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
if
we
just
said
they
were
wrong.
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
we
shouldn't
presume
they're
wrong,
anyway.
justice
white
you
don't
say
that
under
katz
you
treat
the
promise
to
arbitrate
as
part
of
the
conditions
of
employment,
do
you?
justice
white
you
do?
you
mean
that
just
because,
automatically
then
you
can't,
the
employer
can't
get
out
of
arbitrating
any
dispute
prior
to
impasse?
he
can't
get
out
of
arbitrating
any
dispute
that
arises?
justice
white
well,
that
isn't
the
board's
theory.
justice
white
that
isn't...
i
thought
the,
i
thought
that
the
labor
law
says
after
the
contract
expires
you
don't
make
a
unilateral
change--
justice
white
--in
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions.
justice
white
but
labor
also...
the
labor
law
also
says
that
you
don't
imply
promise
to
arbitrate.
once
the
contract
is
over
there's
no
longer
a
promise
to
arbitrate.
justice
white
i'm
talking
about
katz
now.
justice
white
well,
on
that
basis
the
case...
this
case
is
over,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
the...
it
seems
to
me
the
board
in
deciding
this
case
has
squarely
rejected
your
notion
about
katz.
justice
white
well,
it
must
have.
under
your
theory
of
katz,
until
there
has
been
bargaining
to
the
impasse
you
have
to
arbitrate
every
dispute
that
arises.
period.
and
the
board
has
just
now
said
that's
not
so.
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
say
all
of
them
are.
justice
white
i
take
it
you
would
then
say
that
the
no-strike
clause
continues
all
the
way?
