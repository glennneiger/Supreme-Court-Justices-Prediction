justice
kennedy
did
the
board
purport
to
rest
its
decision
in
part
on
katz?
justice
kennedy
but
why
shouldn't
the
katz
prohibition
on
unilateral
changes
prior
to
bargaining
to
impasse
apply
to
arbitration?
justice
kennedy
and
why
is
katz
not
dispositive
here?
because
the
bargaining
had
ceased,
or
there
had
been
bargaining
to
impasse?
justice
kennedy
so
it
follows
from
katz,
but
not
nolde?
justice
kennedy
well,
absent...
suppose
they
have
said
nothing
about
it,
as
here?
justice
kennedy
mr.
rosenfeld,
can
you
argue
in
this
case,
does
it
help
your
case
to
say
that
the
board
is
inconsistent
in
ordering
steps
one
and
two
of
the
grievance
process,
but
not
the
arbitration
process?
justice
kennedy
i
can't
see
how
the
board
or
the
government
can
defend
the
order
to
go
through
grievance
steps
1
and
2,
and
not
arbitration.
justice
kennedy
well,
what's
the
rationale
for
implied...
for
requiring
the
grievance
process
then?
how
could
the
board
require
half
and
not
all?

this
case,
litton
financial
printing
versus
national
labor
relations
board
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
litton
operated
a
printing
plant
and
decided
to
eliminate
part
of
its
printing
operation.
without
notice
to
the
union,
it
laid-off
10
workers.
this
was
at
the
time
when
an
old
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
expired
and
a
new
one
had
yet
to
be
negotiated.
it
was
a
hiatus
between
the
two
agreements.
the
union
filed
grievances
arguing
that
the
lay-offs,
which
included
some
of
the
plant's
most
senior
employees,
violated
the
expired
bargaining
agreement.
that
agreement
had
provided
that
seniority
be
the
deciding
factor
in
case
of
lay-offs
and
provided
"if
other
factors
such
as
aptitude
and
ability
are
equal".
litton
refused
to
submit
to
grievance
or
arbitration
procedures
or
to
negotiate
over
the
lay-offs.
the
nlrb
eventually
concluded
that
litton
had
committed
unfair
labor
practices
in
its
refusal
to
bargain
over
the
lay-offs,
its
refusal
of
the
process
the
grievances,
and
its
wholesale
repudiation
of
any
obligation
to
arbitrate.
the
board
ordered
backpay
and
required
litton
to
submit
the
grievance
procedures.
the
board
held,
however,
that
despite
a
broad
arbitration
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
litton
had
no
obligation
to
arbitrate
any
unresolved
grievances.
this
was
so
because
the
duty
to
arbitrate
is
wholly
contractual.
litton's
contract
with
the
union
was
no
longer
in
effect
and
the
lay-off
grievances
could
not
said
to
arise
under
the
expired
agreement.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
board
on
this
point
and
it
is
that
aspect
of
the
litigation
which
we
review
today.
when
a
bargaining
agreement
expires
and
the
parties
are
in
the
process
of
negotiating
a
new
agreement,
the
employer
has
a
duty
to
refrain
from
making
unilateral
changes
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
the
union
argues
that
because
arbitration
and
other
dispute
resolution
provisions
are
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
the
board
should
impose
a
statutory
duty
to
continue
a
practice
of
arbitrating
disputes
even
where
no
contractual
duty
survives.
we
have
previously
recognized
that
labor
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
consent
that
would
not
be
imposed
beyond
the
scope
of
that
agreement.
the
board's
refusal
to
impose
a
statutory
duty
to
arbitrate
is
rational
and
consistent
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
we
will
defer
to
the
board's
rule.
we
decline
to
extend
the
unilateral
change
doctrine
so
as
to
impose
any
statutory
duty
to
arbitrate.
as
we
have
recognized
nolde
brothers,
a
contractual
duty
to
arbitrate
a
dispute
may
survive
expiration
of
a
bargaining
agreement.
where
the
bargaining
agreement
contains
a
broad
arbitration
clause,
as
in
the
case
here,
the
duty
to
arbitrate
cannot
terminate
in
its
entirety
upon
the
date
of
the
contract's
expiration
rather
the
duty
to
arbitrate
continues
as
to
any
dispute
arising
under
the
contract.
the
employer's
contractual
duties
must
not
be
confused
with
duties
arising
from
the
statutory
obligation
to
refrain
from
imposition
of
unilateral
changes.
nolde
brothers
should
not
be
interpreted
to
require
arbitration
over
whether
an
employer
has
made
a
unilateral
change
in
what
was
a
one-time
contractual
term
or
condition
of
employment.
we
must
determine
whether
the
lay-off
grievances
in
this
case
arise
under
the
bargaining
agreement
even
though
the
lay-offs
did
not
occur
until
almost
a
year
after
the
agreement
had
expired.
we
hold
that
they
do
not
and
that
the
board
was
correct
in
declining
to
order
arbitration.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
that
it
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
order
in
its
entirety.

marshall

which
