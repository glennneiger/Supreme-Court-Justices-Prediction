mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
stevens,
you
were
correct.
the
provision
in
this
contract
is
an
extremely
broad
one.
it's
not
limited
solely
to
questions
of
interpretation
or
application
of
the
contract,
but
includes,
quote,
"differences
that
may
arise
between
the
parties
hereto
regarding
this
agreement.
"
and
surely
between
the
union
and
litton
there
is
a
very
vigorous
dispute
or
difference
between
them
regarding
this
agreement.
and
so
that
surely
our
dispute,
which
is
were
these
layoffs
in
violation
of
the
agreement,
a
matter
that
is
a
difference
between
us
regarding
the
agreement,
and
surely
it
was
arbitrable
during
the
life
of
the
agreement
and
remains
a
difference.
but
our
case
is
far
stronger
because
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
unequivocally
that
the
parties,
even
based
on
the
language
of
the
contract
in
the
board's
cases,
intended
that
seniority
would
continue.
and
that
can
be
seen
from
the
following.
the
board
in
uppco
says
that
one
of
the
things
you
can
look
at,
and
the
board
applies
a
sort
of
an
any
indication
test,
is
there
any
indication
in
the
contract
that
the
parties
intended
that
provision
would
continue?
is
there
any
indication,
in
the
words
that
justice
white
used,
of
any
intent
that
that
language
would
continue?
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
right.
but
the
issue
in
this
case
that
we
would
present
to
the
arbitrator
is
whether
there
was
any
effect
in
the
contract
to
be
intended
by
the
parties
at
some
point
after
the
contract
was
expired.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
we
know
under
nolde,
once
we
make
the
contention
that
that
language
continues,
that
is
the
language
governing
the
dispute
continues,
that
whether
in
fact
it
has
some
effect
or
whether
the
contract
has
been
breached
is
a
matter
for
the
arbitrator
to
determine.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
correct.
and
what
the
board
has
done
in
this
case
and
in
indiana
&
michigan
is
it
has
purported
to
apply
the
same--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--and
more
importantly,
i
think
it's,
it
is
in
fact
compelled
to
do
so.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
because
in
lincoln
mills
this
court
35
years
ago
said
that
interpretation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
is
to
be
left
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
law...
court,
and
it
later--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--that's
right.
and
20
years
later
in
c&c
plywood,
when
the
question
was
before
this
court
could
the
board
even
interpret
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
the
course
of
adjudicating
an
unfair
labor
practice,
what
this
court
said
was
yes,
the
board
could
interpret
it,
not
because
it's
interpreting
the
agreement
and
resolving
those
questions,
but
in
adjudicating
the
unfair
labor
practice.
so
what
the
board
has
purported
to
do
in
this
case
is
recognizing
that
it
is
subservient
to
this
court's
interpretations
of
contracts
under
section
301,
it
has
said
we
will
apply
the
nolde
standards.
the
board
has
an
obligation
under
this
court's
rules
to
apply,
in
interpreting
contracts,
the
nolde
standards
or
to
apply
this
court's
standards
in
interpreting
section
301.
this
court
also
said
that
in
strong
roofing
where
it
said
that...
that
was
a
board
case
once
again
where
the
issue
was
the
interpretation
of
the
contract,
and
this
court
said
that
the
usual
manner
in
which
contracts
are
interpreted
is
not
by
the
board,
but
by
arbitration
of
the
courts.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
correct.
and
all
that
the
board--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
resist.
we
don't
want...
when
this
case
arose
the
union
did
not
go
to
court
to
compel
arbitration,
because
we
were
before
the
board
in
other
unfair
labor
practices.
we
did
not
ask
the
board
to
interpret
the
layoff
provision
of
the
contract.
we
did
not
ask
the
board
to
determine
whether
these
layoffs
violated--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--we
could
have.
we
could
have
at
that
time
gone
to
court
to
compel
arbitration.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
because
at
the
same
time
that
this
was
occurring
this
employer
was
committing
a
number
of
other
unfair
labor
practices
in
refusing
to
arbitrate,
and
we
saw
it
as
an
efficient
method
of
getting
the
whole
problem
resolved
of
this
employer's
refusal
to
bargain
by
filing
an
8(a)(5)
charge,
which
was
sustained.
and
part
of
the
8(a)(5)
refusal
to
bargain
was
the
employer's
repudiation
of
its
obligation
to
arbitrate.
so
that
we
saw
that
as
an
alternative
means.
and
the
board
agreed
with
us.
the
board
ultimately
agreed
that
the
employer
had
repudiated
the
arbitration
provision.
and
then
the
board
said,
contrary
to
nolde,
looking
at
the
seniority
clause,
we
don't
find
this
specific
dispute
to
be
arbitrable.
let
me
explain
how
the
board...
how
the
courts
tell
us
we're
supposed
to
do
that.
what
this
court
said
in
at&t
tech.
you
look
at
the
arbitration
provision.
that's
the
first
thing.
how
broad
is
it?
does
it
cover
the
dispute?
and
surely
the
arbitration
provision,
that
is
differences
between
the
parties
regarding
this
agreement,
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
dispute.
what
is
the
next
step
then
under
this
court's
warrior
&
gulf,
nolde,
and
at&t
tech
cases?
the
next
step
is
to
search
within
the
agreement
for
some
expressed
exclusion
or
other
forceful
evidence
that
that
particular
dispute
is
not
to
be
arbitrated.
in
at&t
tech
there
was
an
express
exclusion.
the
contract
had
an
exclusion
for
certain
management
rights
which
the
parties
agreed
were
not
subject
to
arbitration.
warrior
&
gulf
had
an
ambiguous
exclusion
clause.
but
you
can
find
no
such
exclusion
clause
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
that
litton
ever
sought
to
exclude
from
arbitration.
absent
an
exclusion
clause,
the
only
thing
left
for
litton
to
assert
or
the
board
to
assert
would
prevent
arbitration
is
some
forceful
expression.
the
words
from
at&t
tech
are
an
express
exclusion
or
other
forceful
expression
of
the
parties'
intent
to
exclude
a
particular
dispute.
and
there
the
irony
of
the
case
is
that
the
board
concedes
that
had
the
contract
simply
talked
about
seniority
without
aptitude
and
ability,
it
would
be
arbitrable.
what
the
board
is
trying
to
convince
you
is
that
the
words
"aptitude"
and
"ability"
are
tantamount
to
an
express
exclusion
from
arbitration.
their
argument
amounts
to
a
contention
that
because
the
parties
included
those
words,
somehow
they
did
not
intend
to
arbitrate
this
dispute,
because
the
board
concedes
that
absent
those
words
it
would
be
arbitrable.
and
that's
not
either
an
express
exclusion
or
any
forceful
expression
on
the
part
of
the
parties
to
exclude
this
dispute.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
no.
and
in
fact,
part
of
the...
one
of
the
concerns
that
i
think
that
is
inherent
in
this
case
is
when
does
the
employer's
obligation
to
arbitrate
end.
justice
white,
had
litton
been
concerned
about
it
when
this
contract
was
initially
written,
he
could
have
come
to
the
union,
as
some
employers
do,
and
say
we
don't
want
to
have
to
arbitrate
grievances
after
the
contract,
so
let's
put
an
express
exclusion
that
says
any
grievance
which
arises
after
the
contract
or
which
is
filed
after
the
contract
shall
not
be
arbitrable.
which
of
course
then
leaves
the
union
free
to
go
to
court.
and
that's
what
groves
v.
ring
screw
tells
us.
another--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
right.
and
what...
for
example,
we
could
go...
this
is
what...
in
nolde
brothers,
the
dissent,
in
which
chief
justice
rehnquist
joined,
said
explicitly
that
it
was
clear
that
in
nolde
the
union
could
have
gone
to
court
or
the
individuals
could
have
gone
to
court
to
bring
a
suit
to
collect
their
severance
pay.
now
i
think
we
probably...
we
could
not
have
gone
to
court
in
this
case
directly
to
sue
over
the
seniority
because
we
were
barred
because
we
had
agreed
to
arbitrate
those
disputes.
that
was
our
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
yes.
i
think
clearly
we
could
have
gone
to
court
and
claimed--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--we
could
have
stated
a
claim,
and
i
think
i
could
have
convinced
a
district
court,
had
we
chosen
that
route,
an
alternative
route,
that
the
arbitration
clause
was
broad
enough,
there
was
no
expressed
exclusion,
and
that
under
nolde
we
had
at
least
an
entitlement
to
get
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
right.
and--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--no,
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that
in
order
for
us
to
prevail
in
court
we
have
to
allege
that
there
is
some
understanding
or
agreement
between
the
parties
that
that
provision
over
which
we're
suing
continues.
for
example--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
for
example,
if
i
were
to
go
to
court
on
that
theory,
and
wages
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
because
it
doesn't
sound
like
wages
accrues.
wages
do
to
some
extent
accrue.
for
example,
this
contract
has
a
wage
progression,
and
says
if
you
work
3
months
you
get
a
certain
wage,
6
months
it
increases.
and
i
can
argue,
i
think,
that
the
parties
intended
as
part
of
their
agreement
that
once
you
have
accrued
a
certain
level
of
competence--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--we
could
not
sue
over
the
unilateral
change
there.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
if
we
could
prove
that
the--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--absolutely.
we
have
to
prove
that
there
was
some
agreement
between
the
parties--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--that
that
wage
rate...
some
agreement
that
that
wage
rate
would
continue
in--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--that's
right.
and
that,
for
example--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--and
it's
our
preference,
of
course,
to
make
those
arguments
to
the
arbitrator
rather
than
the
district
court.
and
what
we
would,
for
example--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--it
could
happen.
surely
in
many
cases
where
unions
would
bring
grievances
after
the
contract
has
expired
an
arbitrator
would
more
than
likely
deny
those
grievances
and
say
that
in
some
cases
the
union
is
correct
that
that
concept
of
that
clause
continues,
and,
justice
stevens,
in
other
cases
we
would
lose.
in
this
particular
case
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
in
a
moment
that
i
think
we'd
have
a
strong
contention
before
the
arbitrator
that
this
layoff
provision,
this
seniority
provision
would
continue.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
well,
not
only
do
you
have
to
not
only
decide
it,
i
in
some
sense
should
not
be
pressing
the
argument
because
i'd
be
rather
making
that
argument
to
the
arbitrator
and
letting
him
hear
the
bargaining
history,
letting
the
arbitrator
hear
the
law
of
the
shop,
letting
him
hear
and
look
at
the
language
of
the
contract,
and
apply
his
special
expertise
or
her
special
expertise
to
those
questions.
but
my
opponent,
sitting
across
the
arbitration
table,
may
well
convince
the
arbitrator
that
the
union
is
incorrect
and
that
that
seniority
provision
did
not
continue.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
what
you
do
is
the
process
that
this
court
set
in
warrior
&
gulf,
what
this
court
said
in
nolde
and
at&t
tech.
you
look
at
the
breadth
of
the
arbitration
clause.
you
do
nothing
different
in
the
nolde
situation,
justice
white,
than
you
do
in--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--that's
right.
and
that's
what,
what
your
honor
said
in
at&t.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
what
the
board
said--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
right.
what
you
have
to
apply
in
making
that
decision,
i
submit,
is
what
this
court
has
done
since
1960
in
warrior
&
gulf,
which
is
to
say
not
look
at
the
merits--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--no.
we
say
they
are
wrong
because
the
way
they
went
about
the
analysis,
the
way
they
came
to
the
process
of
making
that
determination,
is
directly
contrary
to--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--i'd
be
satisfied,
but...
but
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
did.
the
ninth
circuit
said
they're
wrong
because
seniority,
they
say
the
board
has
already
told
us
in
uppco
and
united
chrome,
survives,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
they
saw
no
difference
between
seniority
in
this
case
and
in
the
other
two
cases
and
therefore
it
was
arbitrable.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
we
don't
in
this
case
because
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
contract
interpretation
of
the
right
to
arbitrate,
and
those
doctrines
come
from
section
301.
and
even
the
board
concedes
that,
because
the
board
bases
its
decision
on
indiana
&
michigan,
and
in
this
case
upon
the
question
of
the
contract.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
in
determining
arbitrability
they
are
for
the
court.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
no.
for
another
reason--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--well,
actually
i
think
what
the
d.c....
i
suppose
some
respect.
but
what
the
d.c.
circuit
actually
does
in
the
ibew
case
that
we
have
cited
is
that--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--no.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
yes.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
yes.
the
board...
if--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--yes.
the
board
has
traditionally
taken
the
position
that
if
the
employer
regularly
gives
wage
increases,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
this
arises
both
in
the
katz
situation
where
the
employer
has
a
regular
system
of
giving
wage
increases
prior
to
the
completion
of
negotiations,
the
employer
has
to
continue
that
same
system
in
effect.
and
then
when
the
parties
reach
an--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--right.
because
for
example
for
the
employers
to
say
that
during
negotiations
i
will
give
no
regular
wage
increases,
although
i
had
historically
done
it,
is
to
undermine
the
bargaining
process.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that...
not
anticipated,
no.
it's
that
for
the
employer
to
change
conditions
before
the
contract
has
expired...
i'm
sorry,
to
change
conditions
unilaterally
before
the
parties
have
reached
an
agreement
is
to
undermine
the
bargaining
process
because,
for
example,
if
the
employer
stops
giving
regularly
scheduled
wage
increases,
then
the
union
has
to
bargain
it
back
in.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
the
unilateral
change
doctrine
follows
from
katz,
but
it
is
reinforced
by
nolde,
because
what
this
court
said
in
nolde
is
that
once
you
have
arbitration
in
the
contract
there
is
a
presumption
that
it
continues
in
effect
after
the
contract
expired.
and
that
presumption
of
continuation
of
arbitration
is...
it
reinforces
the
board's
position
that
all
terms
and
conditions
which
are
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
continue
after
the
contract
has
expired
until
certain
things
happen,
primarily
an
impasse
in
negotiations
is
reached,
at
which
point
the
employer
is
free
to
change
conditions
consistent
with
its
bargaining
posture.
in
this
case
litton
comes
to
this
court
in
a
very
bad
position,
because
there
was
in
fact
an
election
among
the
employees
who
voted
in
favor
of
the
union.
it
was
a
close
vote,
but
that
vote
occurred
3
months
before
the
contract
was
terminated.
and
litton
had
a
legal
choice
at
that
point.
it
could
have
said
litigate
or
it
could
have
said
negotiate.
it
chose
to
litigate
and
it
lost
8
or
9
months
later.
when
it
lost
and
the
board
said
that
the
union
had
won
the
election
finally,
litton
had
another
choice.
it
could
litigate
or
it
could
violate
the
law.
it
chose
to
refuse
to
bargain.
the
board
found
that
refusal
to
bargain
unlawful.
and
while
it
was
breaking
the
law,
refusing
to
bargain,
it
then
laid
these
people
off.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
yes,
i
do.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
right.
that's
our
theory.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
the
board,
the
board
comes--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
and
the
board
said--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--the
board
doesn't
take
that
position.
the
board
takes
the
position--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--but
katz
says
that
all
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
remain
in
effect
but
cannot
be
unilaterally
reputed
by
the
employer
or
unilaterally
changed
by
the
employer.
the
question
is
whether--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--yes.
that's
my
theory,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
katz
was
not
a
case
involving
arbitration.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
no.
katz
was
a
case
involving
changes
in
other...
in
other
conditions
of
employment.
this
court
has
not
yet
decided
the
question,
the
precise
question
of
whether
katz
encompasses
arbitration.
but
katz
encompasses
all
conditions,
and
the
board's
theory
in
indiana
&
michigan
was
that
arbitration
also
could
not
be
unilaterally
changed
as
long
as
there
was
a
consensual
basis--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--that's
right.
but
when
congress
said
there
would
be
no
compulsory
arbitration,
what
congress
said
was
that
the
law
does
not
compel
litton
or
any
other
employer
to
agree
to
arbitration.
but
what
the
board...
what
we
think
that
katz
now
says
is
that
once
you
have
agreed
to
some
kind
of
arbitration,
however
expansive
it
is
or
however
limited
it
is,
once
you
agreed
to
it
in
the
contract
you
cannot
simply
walk
away
from
it
at
the
expiration
of
the
agreement.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
i
don't
believe
they
have.
but
i
think
the
board--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--but
the
board
has
said
surely
that
some
disputes
are
arbitrable
once
the
contract
has
expired
under
katz.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
what
we
say
is
that
you
should
hold
that
the
obligation
to
arbitrate,
once
the
contract
has
expired,
is
congruent
with
the
obligation
to
arbitrate
during
the
life
of
the
agreement,
unless
the
parties
have
agreed
to
some
other
system,
which
the
parties
under
our
system
of
collective
bargaining
agreement,
they're...
entitled
to
do.
the
parties
could
well
agree
that
certain
things
would
not
be
arbitrated
during
the
life
of
the
agreement.
for
example,
parties
can
agree
that
jurisdiction
is
not
arbitrable
or
that
wages
are
not
arbitrable.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
it
lasts
either
for
the
time
that
the
parties
have
said
in
their
own
bargaining
process--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--or
it
lasts
until
the
employer
takes
action,
and
this
is
almost
exclusively
in
the
employer's
control,
until
the
employer
takes
action
to
propose
that
there
be
no
further
arbitration,
bargains
to
an
impasse,
at
which
point
there
is
no
further
obligation.
for
example
in
this
case--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
that's
right.
what
the
board
says
is
that
the
parties
are
free
in
their
collective
bargaining,
and
this
is
our
system
of
bargaining.
they're
free
to
negotiate
virtually
anything
they
want.
for
example,
there
are
board
cases
where
the
contract
provides
for
a
certain
level
of
pension
contribution,
and
then
the
employer
simply
stops
those
pension
contributions
at
the
end
of
the
contract.
and
the
board
has
said
the
employer
is
free
to
do
so
provided
the
contract
clearly
and
unmistakably
provides
the
employer
that
right.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
the
board
says
that
if
that
waiver
is
clear
and
unmistakable,
that
if--
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
--your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
no
unfair
labor
practice.
because
the
board
respects
the
bargaining
process
and
the
language
of
the
contract.
now
the
board
is
wary
of
finding
those
clear
and
explicit
waivers,
but
there
are
some
few
cases
where
unions
and
employers
have
agreed
that
once
the
contract
has
expired
the
employer
can
make
certain
unilateral
changes.
for
example,
the
common
area
where
it
occurs
is
in
cost
of
living
increases.
the
union
recognizes
that
cola's
may
not
be
applicable
after
the
contract.
there
are
cases
where...
for
example
this
contract
illustrates
it.
there
is
an
explicit
provision
that
provides
that
the
health
and
welfare...
i'm
sorry,
the
pension
contribution...
the
health
and
welfare
contribution
amount
lasts
until
9
months
after
the
contract
expires.
it
says
that
the
level
of
contribution
will
be
$55
until
july
of
1988,
which
was
some
9
months
after
the
initial
contract
had
expired.
so
the
parties
dealt
with
that
problem
of
defining
what
their
obligation
would
be.
and
then
they
later
changed
the
amount
of
pension
contribution
and
increased
it
just
a
month
before
the
contract
had
expired,
obviously
i
think
anticipating
that
when
the
contract
had
expired
they
would
bargain
from
that
level.
now
the
parties
could
well
have
said
that
with
the
expiration
of
the
contract
the
employer
will
cease
contributing
to
the
union's
trust
fund,
because
the
parties
had
contemplated
that
with
the
next
agreement
they
would
substitute
a
new
health
and
welfare
or
pension
program.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
it's
not
only
inconsistent,
your
honor,
it
puts
the
union
at
a
severe
disadvantage
because
presumably
during
that
period
when
we
have
to
go
through
steps
1
and
2,
we
can't
take
economic
action,
while
the
board
says
theoretically
we
can
at
some
other
point,
and
that
process
could
be
dragged
out
for
some
period
of
time.
but
more
importantly,
going
through
steps
1
and
2
in
this
case
is
a
useless
exercise
because
all
we
do
is
go
to
the
employer
and
if
he
rejects
it,
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
even
chairman
dotson
in
his
dissent
in
indiana
&
michigan
said
that
it's
like
truncating
this
well-crafted
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
to
say
that
there
is
some
obligation
to
go
through
the
first
part
of
it
but
not
the
last
part.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
it
also
creates
another
severe
anomaly,
which
is
that
there
are
many
grievance
procedures
which
provide
for
joint
adjustment
boards.
the
gateway
coal
case
gives
a
very
good
example
where
there
are
five
intermediate...
five
initial
steps,
and
then
a
joint
adjustment
board
composed
of
union
officials
from
another
union
and
mine
officials
from
another
mine.
and
we
don't
know
whether
the
board
is
telling
us
that
that
step,
which
is
like
arbitration
for
some
purposes
and
unlike
arbitration
for
other
purposes,
is
governed
by
this
doctrine.
and
yet
that...
and
then
that
mineworker
contract
provides
that
there's
finally
a
step,
which
is
at
that
joint
board,
which
is
very
common
to
contracts
but
not
here,
the
final
step
is
arbitration
before
a
neutral
party
who
renders
a
binding
decision.
mr.
david
a.
rosenfeld
yes,
and
the
board
has
said
that
in
1978
in
goya
foods.
and
once
again,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
when
you
dissented
in
nolde
you
did
for
one
strong...
there
were
two
reasons,
but
the
primary
reason
was
because
of
this
note
of
the
strike
problem.
and
a
year
later
the
board
in
goya
foods
said
that
we
will
imply
the
continued
obligation
not
to
strike
over
arbitrable
grievances,
and
we
accept
that.
we
recognize
that
we
can't.
and
in
this
case
this
is
what
the
union
did.
the
union
filed
a
grievance
asserting
that
the
layoffs
were
unjust.
we
asked
for
the
benefit
of
our
bargain,
which
was
to
go
to
the
arbitrator
and
have
the
arbitrator
make
the
determination
whether
those
grievances
violated
the
agreement.
the
employer
refused.
we
didn't
want
to
make
the
arguments
about
the
language
of
the
contract
to
the
board,
and
i
surely
don't
want
to
make
those
arguments
to
this
court.
because
what
the
board
tells
us
and
what
this
court
has
told
us
since
warrior
&
gulf
is
that
those
arguments
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
layoff
clause,
the
meaning
of
seniority,
and
whether
the
parties
intended
that
language
to
continue,
those
are
arguments
to
be
made
to
the
arbitrator
and
not
to
the
court
and
not
to
the
board.
thank
you.
