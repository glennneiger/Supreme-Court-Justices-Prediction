chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-285,
litton
financial
printing
division
v.
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
diederich,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
suppose--
--or
more
precisely
that
you
don't
carry
nolde
over,
which
is
a
301
case,
to
section
8(b)(5).
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
position
also
is
that
you
don't
carry
over
any
doctrine
from
nolde,
which
was
a
section
301
case,
to
8(b)(5)
when
you
have
defined
the
refusal
to
bargain.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
katz
was
also
during
the
course
of
bargaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
didn't
cover
the
situation
where
the
contract
had
expired.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you're...
i
mean,
surely
we
deserve
to
be
cited
something
better
than
that,
don't
we?
well,
that's
what
katz
holds,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
katz
holds
in
the
course
of
bargaining
the
employer
can't
do
it.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
situation
when
the
contract
has
expired.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
why
do
you
agree
that
an
employer
can't
change
the
conditions
of
bargaining...
can't
change
the
conditions
of
employment
after
the
contract
has
expired
even
though
he
continues
to
bargain
about
them?
why
is
he
bound
to
keep
them
the
way
they
were?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
i
thought
you
did.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
diederich.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
there's
a
duty
to
bargain
when
the
contract
expires,
even
though
the
employer
is
no
longer
bound
by
the
condition,
and
that
katz
holds
that
during
a
period
of
bargaining
you
cannot
make
unilateral
changes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
it
were
not
during
a
period
of
bargaining,
then,
the
employer
could
make
unilateral
changes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the...
what
did
the
board
base
its
reason
for
doing
that
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
rosenfeld,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
section
301
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
has
purported
to
apply
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
didn't,
it
didn't
say
it
was
to
be
left
to
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings,
which
is
what
you're
in
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
not
by
the
board
in
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings.
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
is
what
you
have
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
didn't
you?
you
would
have...
you
could
have
gone
to
court
under
nolde,
certainly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
didn't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
you
have
gone
to
court
to
compel
arbitration?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
would
have
to
nevertheless
convince
the
court
that
your
cause
of
action
really
goes
back
to
the
contract,
even
though
it's
expired.
chief
justice
rehnquist
those
are
not
questions
then
even
that
are
primarily
for
the
arbitrator?
they're
for
a
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
it...
even
though
there
is
no
contractual
requirement
at
that
point
that
would
be
enforced?
chief
justice
rehnquist
katz
covers
arbitration
in
that
language?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
know
it
wasn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
are
other
forces
in
the
labor
law
besides
the
idea
of
no
unilateral
changes
during
bargaining,
and
one
of
them
is
no
compulsory
arbitration.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
we
should
hold
either
all
or
none
are?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
for
what
period
of
time
does
this
obligation
last?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenfeld.
mr.
wallace,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-285,
litton
financial
printing
division
versus
nlrb
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
