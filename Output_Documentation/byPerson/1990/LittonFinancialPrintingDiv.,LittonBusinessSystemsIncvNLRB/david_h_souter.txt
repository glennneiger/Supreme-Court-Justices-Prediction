justice
souter
but
wasn't
it
the
case,
isn't
it
the
case
that
to
the
extent
that
seniority
is
claimed
to
be
a
factor,
it
does
arise
under
the
contract?
justice
souter
well,
were
the
grievances
in
this
case
expressed
solely
in
terms
of
aptitude
and
ability
as
opposed
to
terms
of
seniority
on
the
assumption
that
aptitude
and
ability
were
equal?
justice
souter
well,
then
why
doesn't
that
arise
under
the
contract?
justice
souter
excuse
me,
maybe
i
don't,
still
don't
understand
the
grievance.
i
thought
you
were
saying
or
indicating
in
effect
that
the
grievances
claimed,
that
there
were
instances
in
which
ability
and
aptitude
were
equal,
and
that
therefore
seniority
ought
to
be
determinative.
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
okay,
that's
maybe
where
we...
so
they
were
simply
saying...
the
grievances
were
simply
claiming
that
seniority
and
seniority
alone
entitled
them
to
some
consideration
they
didn't
get?
justice
souter
okay.
