justice
stevens
there
were
none,
but
there
should
have
been
some.
isn't
it
true
that
under
the
board's
theory
there
should
have
been,
because
you
had
refused
to
bargain?
justice
stevens
had
you
obeyed
the
law
there
would
have
been
on-going
negotiations.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
your
initial
refusal
to
bargain
was
for
the
purpose
of
getting
that
determination,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
interrupt
right
there?
isn't
that
precisely
what
the
union
claims
here?
that
the
discharges
on
seniority
grounds
violated
the
contract?
and
the
defense
to
that
is
the
contract
had
expired
and
the
don't.
but
in
terms
of
the
request
for
arbitration,
if
they
are
right
that
the
contract
did
prohibit
these
discharges,
why
doesn't
the
language
you
read
from
nolde
apply
squarely
to
this
case?
justice
stevens
well,
when
did
their
seniority
accrue
here?
justice
stevens
and
if
you
say
in
this
case
they
have
made
such
an
allegation,
then
the
arbitrator
could
say
well,
they
have
alleged
it
but
the
contract
had
expired,
so
there
is
no
remedy
in
arbitration.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
that
where
we
start,
with
the
arbitration
clause?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
let
me
just
get
sort
of
a
simple
point
out
of
the
back
of
my
head.
you
can
allege
that
the
discharge
10
months
later
violated
the
agreement,
and
then
presumably
the
court
can
hold
yes,
you're
entitled
to
have
that
arbitrated
because
you
have
alleged
that
it
violates
the
agreement.
but
it
would
still
remain
possible
for
the
arbitrator
to
say
well,
yes,
they're
claiming
it
arises
out
of
the
agreement,
therefore
i
have
jurisdiction
to
arbitrate,
but
i
don't
see
how
in
the
world
something
that
happened
10
months
later
arose
out
of
the
agreement.
therefore
you
lose
on
the
merits.
that
could
happen,
couldn't
it?
justice
stevens
of
course
we
don't
have
to
decide
that,
i
don't
think,
do
we?
