justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
diederich,
had
this
grievance
arisen
during
the
life
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
arbitration
have
been
required?
justice
o'connor
and
there
certainly
is
a
good
deal
of
language
in
this
court's
decision
in
nolde
that
suggests
that,
similarly,
arbitration
would
be
required
if
it
occurs
after
the
expiration
of
the
agreement,
as
here.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
board
takes
the
position
that
some
of
these
grievances
might
have
to
be
arbitrated
and
some
not,
and
in
this
case
this
one
should.
i
mean,
solicitor
general
will
argue
a
position
that
differs
from
your
own.
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
board?
