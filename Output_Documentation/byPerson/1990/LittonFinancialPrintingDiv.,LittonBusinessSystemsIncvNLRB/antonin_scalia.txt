justice
scalia
mr.
diederich,
there
is
a
long,
long
line
of
authority.
i
mean,
i
thought,
i
had
thought
it
was
fairly
well
established
federal
labor
law
that
if
you
make
a
unilateral
change
in
the
provisions
that
you're
obliged
to
abide
by
under
a
contract,
you
are
not
only
in
breach
of
contract,
but
you
are
also
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
your...
the
principle
you
have
just
espoused
attacks
that
whole
line
of
jurisprudence,
doesn't
it?
why
would
you
limit
it
to
the
arbitration
agreement?
justice
scalia
was
that
done
here?
justice
scalia
well,
wages
are
based
on
contract
too,
aren't
they?
justice
scalia
on
what
basis?
on
the
theory
that
the
pre-existing
contract
continues
unless
you
bargain
to
change
it,
no?
justice
scalia
well,
so
are
the
wages.
is
there
no
strong
feeling
of
contract
that
an
employer
shouldn't
have
to
pay
anymore
than
he
agrees
to
pay,
and
that
a
worker
shouldn't
have
to
accept
any
less
than
he
agrees
to
accept?
justice
scalia
well,
i
understand
why
an
arbitration
agreement
isn't
one
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
if
you
have
a
dispute
you
have
to--
justice
scalia
--but
you
just
arbitrarily
say
we'll
change
some
of
them
and
we
won't
change
other
ones.
justice
scalia
i
hear
you,
but
i
don't
understand.
everything
you
say
could
be
said
about
wages.
justice
scalia
the
board's
rule
purports
to
be
an
application
of
our
decision
in
nolde,
and
we
said
in
nolde
specifically
quoting
an
earlier
case,
the
question
of
interpretation
of
the
collecting
bargaining
agreement
is
a
question
for
the
arbitrator.
and
all
you
have
here
is
a
question
of
interpreting
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
is
it
intended
to
apply
post-agreement
in
this
respect
or
not?
why
isn't
that
a
question
for
the--
justice
scalia
--but
mr.
wallace,
isn't
the
critical
term
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
the
term
that
describes
the
duty
to
arbitrate,
which
says
there
shall
be
arbitration
if
there
is
an
allegation
the
contract
has
been
breached?
justice
scalia
well,
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
other
side,
it's
that
that's
not
really
the
issue
in
this
case.
that
they...
they
conceded
your
clients
have
their
seniority.
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
seniority
continues.
they
acknowledge
it
does.
the
question
is
what's
the
effect
of
the
seniority
upon
this
particular
dismissal.
justice
scalia
and
that
isn't
covered.
justice
scalia
well,
it
may
be,
but
you
can't
answer
the
question
before
us
by
simply
saying
it's
clear
that
seniority
was
meant
to
continue
after
the
agreement
ended.
we
can
give
you
that,
and
you
still
are
left
with
the
question
of
whether
this
is
an
issue
that
under
the
board's
cases
must
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator
or
not.
justice
scalia
i
guess
in
that
respect,
mr.
rosenfeld,
you
are
in
a
different
situation
with
respect
to
the
arbitration
clause
than
you
are
with
respect
to
the
other
continuing
terms
and
conditions.
that
is
to
say
if
the
employer
didn't
pay
the
wages
that
he
had
previously
been
paying
and
was
obliged
to
pay
under
the
contract,
you
couldn't
sue
him
for
breach
of
contract
once
the
contract
had
expired.
your
only
remedy
for
the
wages
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
no?
why
not?
justice
scalia
are
you
answering
my
question
about
the
wages?
justice
scalia
suppose
the...
all
right.
justice
scalia
but
you
have
to
prove
that
for
the
arbitration
clause,
too,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
have
to
show
the
arbitration
clause
would
intend
to
continue.
so
you're
saying
if
you
can
show
that
the
wages
were
intended
to
continue,
just
as
you
can
show
that
the
arbitration
clause
was,
you'd
be
in
the
same
boat
with
respect
to
wages
as
you
are
with
respect
to
arbitration.
justice
scalia
the
board
works
with
these
contracts
all
the
time.
we
give
deference
to
the
interpretation,
or
at
least
the
d.c.
circuit
does,
i
know,
and
it
may
be
based
on
our
cases,
to
the
interpretation
of
power
contracts,
for
example,
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
and
you
don't
think
we
should
give
any
deference
to
the
board's
interpretation
of
it?
justice
scalia
no...
not
even
respect,
you
wouldn't
say?
justice
scalia
will
you
answer
me
this.
suppose
you
have
a
contract
that
has
a
wage
system
that's
just
like
the
federal
salary
level.
you're
entitled
to
a
step
increase
every
year.
do
you
know...
what
would
the
board
do
if,
if
the
contract
comes
to
an
end
and
the
employer
continues
to
pay
everybody
what
they
were
getting
before
the
contract
ended,
but
stops
giving
them
the
step
increases?
justice
scalia
would
the
board
consider
that
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
scalia
it
would?
justice
scalia
so
it
is
treated
like
arbitration.
the
theory
is
that
that
was
what
was
anticipated
in
the
contract.
is
that
the
theory
of
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
rosenfeld,
can
an
employer
do
the
same
for
wages?
can
he
bargain
that
these
step
increases
that
you're
entitled
to
under
this
contract
only
continue
as
long
as
the
contract
is
in
effect,
and
once
the
contract
is
over
no
more
step
increases?
justice
scalia
and
then,
and
then
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
if
he--
justice
scalia
--what
if
it
says
clearly
and
unmistakably
i
can
give
any
wages
i
want
once
the
contract
ends?
once
the
contract
ends
all
bets
are
off
and
i
can
reduce
wages
from
$100
to
$90.
justice
scalia
no
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
scalia
no
unfair
labor
practice?
