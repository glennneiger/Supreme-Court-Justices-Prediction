mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
national
labor
relations
board
found
that
the
employer
in
this
case
had
violated
section
8(a)(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
refusing
to
arbitrate
10
identical
grievances
filed
by
the
union
when
the
grievance
events
took
place
some
11
months
after
the
expiration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
even
though
the
board
found
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(5)
because
of
the
repudiation,
it
declined
to
order
the
parties
to
arbitrate
because
in
its
view
it
did
not
feel
that
the
particular...
the
particular
grievances,
which
involved
a
layoff
and
a
provision
in
the
contract
dealing
with
layoffs,
arose
under
the
contract.
and
just
briefly,
the
reasoning
of
the
board
was
that
because
aptitude
and
ability
controlled
the
layoffs,
or
order
of
layoffs
before
seniority
became
a
factor,
that
the
grievances
did
not
arise
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
in
the
board's
view,
which
i
think
is
correct,
seniority
does
not
become
a
factor
until
ability
and
aptitude
are
determined.
and
ability
and
aptitude
certainly
do
not
arise
under
a
contract
because
under
the
board's
view,
relying
on
nolde,
it
doesn't...
a
grievance
does
not
arise
under
a
contract
unless
it
is
some
right
which
can
be
accrued
or
is
a
vested
right,
such
as
wages,
pension
benefits,
or
severance
pay.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
the
grievances
were
expressed
in
terms
of
seniority.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
because
the
contract
provides
that
aptitude
and
ability
are
the
controlling
factors,
and
seniority
never
becomes
a
factor
until
you
prove
that,
or
you
are
able
to
demonstrate--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--no,
i
don't
think
the
grievances
mentioned
aptitude
and
ability
at
all.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
the
exact
words
were
"out
of
seniority".
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
board's
determination
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(5)
because
of
the
repudiation,
the
refusal
to
arbitrate,
but
the
court
reversed
the
board's
decision
on
the...
arising
under
theory
that
the
board
had
adopted
and
said
that
was
unreasonable,
and
directed
the
parties
to
arbitrate.
now
there
is
in
collective
bargaining
a
constant
theme
that
the
parties
are
supposed
to
determine
what
goes
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
not
the
government.
and
in
a
case
like
this
where
we
have
a
contract
that
we
have
to
look
at
and
interpret
and
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
history,
i
think
it's
especially
important
to
look
at
the
particular
contract
provisions
that
are
involved
and
try
to
determine
what
the
intent
of
the
parties
was,
if
it
can
be
determined
from
that
language.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
yes.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
yes,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
nolde
was
a
civil
action
under
section
301,
which
is
a
statute,
i
am
sure
as
you
know,
which
gives
unions
the
right
to
sue
employees
and
vice-versa.
and
one
of
the
reasons
they
can
sue
is
to
enforce
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
precisely
the
question
that
i
am
presenting
here.
is
a
section
301
lawsuit
properly
applicable
to
a
section
8(a)(5)
unfair
labor
practice
case,
because
congress
has
specifically
defined
what
is
involved
in
a
refusal
to
bargain.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
the
only
unfair
labor
practice
of
which
i
am
aware
where
congress
has
specifically
defined
what
the
violation
is.
and
i
simply
don't
believe
that
if
you
read
the
statute,
section
8(a)(5)
and
its
definition
in
section
8(d),
that
you
can
say
that
the
employer's
conduct
in
this
case
fits
within
the
definition
of
that
statute.
you
would
have
to
shoehorn
that
conduct
into
that
statute.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
no,
i
think
the
board's
position
was
that
there
was
a
violation
in
the
blanket
repudiation
of
the
arbitration
provision.
but
the
board
determined
that
the
parties
were
not
required
to
arbitrate.
so--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--this
specific
reason...
grievance.
and
on
that
point
the
board
and
myself
are
on
the
same
side,
although
from
my
standpoint
that
is
kind
of
a
fall-back
argument.
i
have
made
more
of
a
frontal
attack
on
the
applicability
of
section
8(a)(5)
and
section
8(d),
whether
they
apply
at
all
to
this
employer's
conduct.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
the
question.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
absolutely,
because
congress
has
specifically
defined
in
section
8(d)
what
a
refusal
to
bar...
what
the
obligation
to
bargain
entails.
and
if
you
don't
meet
that
obligation
then
you
have
refused
to
bargain.
so
congress,
having
spoken
very
specifically
in
terms
of
what
a
section
8(a)(5)
violation
is,
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
that
language
in
a
section
301
suit,
which
is
a
suit
really
where
you
are
just
determining
arbitrability.
now,
there's
a
great
deal
of
significance
and
there's
stigma
attached
to
being
found
to
have
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor,
because
the,
the
landmark
case
for
the
proposition
that
you
cite
on
unilateral
change
of
working
conditions
is
katz,
and
in
katz
the
theory
was
that
while
there
are
ongoing
negotiations
it
is
destructive
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
for
the,
for
an
employer
to
make
unilateral
changes.
in
other
words,
you
can't
be
negotiating
about
sick
leave,
and
the
next
day
institute
unilaterally
a
brand
new
sick
leave
policy,
because
that
disrupts...
excuse
me...
disrupts
the
collective
bargaining
process.
in
this
case
there
were
no
ongoing
negotiations.
11
months
had
elapsed
without
any
negotiations.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
well--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--not
entirely
correct.
for
the
first
10
months
of
that
11
month
hiatus,
the
status...
the
representative
status
of
the
union
was
in
doubt,
because
there
was
a
board
proceeding.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
at
the
end
of
the...
around
the
end
of
the
10
month
period,
the
board
certified
the
union.
at
that
point
the
company--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--no.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
there
was
a
petition
filed
by
an
employee
seeking
to
decertify
the
union--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--shortly
before
the
contract
expired.
that
entire
proceeding,
from
the
time
that
petition
was
filed
until
the
board
ultimately
certified
the
union,
was
10
months
after
contract
expiration.
at
the
end
of
that
10-month
period
when
the
union
was
certified,
the
company
exercised
its
right
to
then
challenge
the
validity
of
that
board
certification
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
that
is
how...
1
month
of
the
entire
11-month
period
was
devoted
to
a
technical
refusal
to
bargain,
which
is
the
only
method,
your
honor,
by
which
an
employer
can
test
the
validity
of
a
board
certification.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
no.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
think
the
board
did.
the
union
argued
katz,
but
i
don't
believe
the
board
argued
katz,
and
i
don't
believe
the
board
relied
on
katz.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
because
we
have
a
long
history
saying
that
arbitration
is
consensual,
and
we
have
many
supreme
court
cases
saying
that
arbitration
is
consensual,
and
we
have
a
statute
which
says
that
a
part...
basically
it
says
the
parties
should
determine
what
goes
into
an
agreement
and
not
the
government.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
yes.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
absolutely
not.
there
is
no...
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
in
terms
of
whether--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--he
has
to
bargain,
yes.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
he
can
bargain,
and
when,
i
think--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--i
don't
think
it's
clear,
your
honor,
that
you
have
to
bargain
to
impasse.
it's
clear
that
you,
if
you're
going
to
make
a
change
you
have
to
bargain.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
yes.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
yes.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
well,
you
asked
me
about
wages.
you
have
to
bargain
about
wages.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
bargain
about
arbitration
because--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--no.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
right.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
true.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
not
after
the
contract
expires.
after
the
contract
expires
they
exist
by
the
obligation
to
maintain
the
wages
that
exist
by
operation
of
law.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
no.
not
on
the
basis
that
the
contract
continues.
on
the
basis
that
they
were
working
conditions,
and
as
working
conditions
they
cannot
be
unilaterally
altered
without
giving
the
union
an
opportunity
to
bargain.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
the
authority
for
that?
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
is
the
board's
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
that's
what
katz
holds.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
absolutely
not.
no
case
has
ever
come
before--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--i
didn't
say
he
couldn't
change
them.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
i
misspoke.
he
has
to
give
the
union
an
opportunity
to
bargain
over
the
changes.
i
don't
think
you
have--
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
--that's
my
understanding
of
the
law.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
but
not
with
respect
to
arbitration.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
because
the
board
has
made
an
exception
with
respect
to
arbitration.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
that's
my
understanding,
yes.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
you
could
sue
for
breach
of
contract.
that's
right.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
pardon?
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
not
under
the
contract
theory.
i
think
at
that
point
when
the
contract
has
expired,
the
collective
bargaining
scheme
leaves
resolutions
of
disputes
that
arise
to
the
parties
and
their
economic
power
in
their
bargaining.
i
think
that's
the
theory
of
the
collective
bargaining
scheme.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
no.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
vacation
pay
is
a
vested
right,
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
vacation
pay.
mr.
mathias
j.
diederich
well,
yes.
yes.
but
not
a
layoff
provision
such
as
this
one.
