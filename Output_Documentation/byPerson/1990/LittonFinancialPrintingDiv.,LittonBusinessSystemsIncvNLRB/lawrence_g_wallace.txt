mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
address
preliminarily
a
question
that
has
arisen,
the
period
after
contract
expiration
is
a
period
of
bargaining
prior
to
agreement
on
a
new
contract
or
the
reaching
of
impasse.
and
that
is
why
the
board
has
applied
katz
to
the
post-expiration
period,
but
on
the
rationale
that
the
employer
cannot
make
unilateral
changes
during
the
period
of
bargaining.
it's
only
coincidental
that
the
wages
had
been
prescribed
by
the
expired
contract.
they
happened
to
be
the
prevailing
wages--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--precisely
so.
we
explain
that
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief
and
cite
this
court's
decision
in
laborers
health
and
welfare
against
advanced
lightweight.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
after
impasse,
for
example.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
because
katz
is
an
interpretation
of
how
to
interpret
and
apply
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
it
upheld
the
board's
view
that
the
act
ordinarily
bars
changes
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
during
the
bargaining
period.
but
the
board
has
also
adopted
the
view
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
apply
katz
to
certain
terms
because
it
would
be
contrary
to
other
policies
of
the
act,
such
as
dues
check-off,
or
union
shop,
and
arbitration,
because
it
would
be
very
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
strong
statutory
determination
by
congress
that
compulsory
arbitration
is
not
to
be
required,
that
arbitration
is
solely
a
creature
of
contracts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
only
coincidental
that
the
change
would
be
a
change
in
a
contractually
prescribed
term.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
carrying
forward
the
expired
contract.
it
is
a
matter
of
changing
the
existing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
that's
what
we
try
to
explain
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is,
it
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
not
arbitrary,
mr.
justice,
it...
the
point
is
the
rationale
of
katz
is
not
based
on
carrying
the
contract
obligations
forward.
and
arbitration
cannot
be
compelled
by
law.
arbitration
is
solely
a
creature
of
contract.
if
the
contract
obligation
is
not
being
carried
forward,
it's
inappropriate
to
require
adherence
to
arbitration.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
wages
are
being
paid.
i
can't
really
explain
it
more
clearly
than
that.
in
its
1987
decision
in
indiana
&
michigan
electric,
the
board
definitively
set
forth
the
principles
it
would
follow
in
implementing
this
court's
decision
in
nolde.
nolde's
rationale
readily
led
the
board
to
carry
forward
to
the
hiatus
period,
a
period
of
bargaining
between
expiration
of
the
contract
and
before
renewal
or
impasse,
the
board's
longstanding
rule
that
a
wholesale
refusal
to
arbitrate
grievances
under
a
contract
to
arbitrate
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
rule
is
based
on
the
notion
that
a
wholesale
refusal
to
submit
grievances
to
arbitration
is
a
repudiation
of
the
bargain
that
was
reached,
and
therefore
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
point
of
trying
to
apply
nolde.
nolde
said
that
the
parties
are
presumed
to
have
carried...
to
have
an
intent
to
have
carried
forward
the
obligation
to
arbitrate
during
this
hiatus
period
to
disputes
arising
under
the
contract.
and
therefore
if
the
employer
categorically
repudiated
its
arbitration
obligation
during
this
period,
taking
into
account
the
rationale
of
nolde,
the
ordinary
rule
that
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
carries
forward.
the
more
difficult
question
for
the
board
was
the
remedial
one
of
how
to
identify
whether
the
particular
grievances
asserted
in
the
case
are
within
the
category
that
there
is
a
duty
to
arbitrate
during
hiatus.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
and
in
addressing
this,
the
board
took
note
that
in
nolde
itself,
before
holding
that
contract
expiration
does
not
necessarily
extinguish
the
duty
to
arbitrate,
this
court
very
carefully
described
the
nature
of
the
grievances
and
of
the
union's
contentions
that
it
was
addressing
in
that
case.
and
i
refer
the
court
specifically
to
page
248
of
volume
430
u.s.
in
which
the
court
took
pains
to
say
that
the
union
maintained
here
that
the
severance
wages
at
issue
were
accrued
or
vested
rights
earned
by
employees
during
the
term
of
the
contract,
although
payable
only
upon
termination
of
employment,
and
that
the
union's
claim
was
that
the
parties
considered
the
severance
pay
as
part
of
the
employee's
compensation
for
services
performed
during
the
life
of
the
agreement.
and
the
question--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--because
nolde
was
talking
about
rights
that
accrued
during
the
pre-expiration
period.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
gets
to
a
question
of
the
application
of
the
board's
rule,
whether
what
was
involved
in
this
case
was
a
claim
based
on
seniority,
and
the
board
reasonably
determined
in
applying
its
rule
here
to
the
contract
provision,
which
is
set
forth
at
the
top
of
page
9
of
our
brief,
the
contract
provision
says
in
case
of
layoffs,
length
of
continuous
service
will
be
the
determining
factor
if
other
things,
such
as
aptitude
and
ability,
are
equal.
and
in
construing
this,
the
board
reasonably
determined
that
seniority
is
only
a
fall
back
criterion
here
and
that
what
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
arbitrator
necessarily
as
the
first
question
is
whether
aptitude
and
ability
are
equal
between
the
more
senior
and
the
less
senior
person.
and
that
is
a
question
to
be
determined
with
respect
to
aptitudes
and
abilities
during
the
post-expiration
period,
at
the
time
of
the
layoff,
and
with
respect
to
the
conditions
at
the
time
of
the
layoff,
which
have
in
this
case
quite
dramatically
changed
because
the
employer
has
changed
his
operations.
and
that
would
mean
submitting
to
the
arbitrator
the
determination
of
a
post-expiration
question
as
the
primary
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
question
of
arbitrability
under
this
court's
decision
in
at&t
technologies
against
communication
workers
is
a
matter
for
the
court,
or
in
this
case
the
board,
the
decision-making
tribunal
to
determine.
the
question
of
arbitrability
under
that
decision
is
not
to
be
relegated
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
there
were
a
provision
capable
of
being
interpreted
that
way
under
the
board's
rule,
the
case...
the
question
would
be
arbitrable.
but
the
board's
rule
is
one
based
on
whether
the
contract
rights
are
rights
capable
of
accruing
or
vesting
to
some
degree
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
overlap
in
some
cases
between
questions
on
the
merits
in
interpreting
a
collective
agreement
and
the
question
of
arbitrability
which
a
court,
or
in
this
case
the
board,
nonetheless
has
a
duty
to
determine
even
if
that
involves
construing
relevant
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
depends
on--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
dependent
on
whether
the
board's
view
of
how
to
reconcile
nolde
with
the
act's
no
compulsory
arbitration
provision
by
taking
the
narrower
reading
of
the
category
of
claims
that
nolde
makes
it
appropriate
to
submit
to
arbitration
during
the
post-expiration
period,
whether
that
view
is
proper.
and
the
board
concluded
that
that
view
more
properly
reconciles
the
pertinent
labor
law
considerations.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
page
58
in
indiana
&
michigan
the
board
specifically
said
that
it
has
concluded
that
katz
should
not
apply
to
post-expiration
withdrawal
from
arbitration.
and
that
is
a
matter
that
goes
to
the
board's
core
expertise
in
interpreting
and
applying
the
act
itself
that
the
union
is
taking
issue
with.
we
have
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief
some
of
the
pitfalls
of
extending
katz
to
this
area,
and
we
think
the
board's
determination
there
is
entitled
to
deference.
in...
we
disagree
also
that
if
the
board,
in
reading
the
arbitration
provisions,
concludes
that
a
matter
would
have
been
arbitrable
before
expiration,
that
necessarily
means
the
board
has
to
conclude
that
it
would
be
arbitrable
after
expiration.
if
any
claim
invoking
a
provision
of
the
contract
were
arbitrable,
that
would
mean
if
an
employee
was
hired
after
the
contract
expired
and
then
discharged
several
months
later,
still
during
the
hiatus
period,
his
discharge
would
be
arbitrable,
even
though
he
never
worked
under
the
contract
while
it
was
in
effect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
the
board
concluded
that
the
requirement...
carrying
forward
the
requirement
of
submitting
decision-making
authority
to
an
outsider
goes
beyond
a
process
of
bargaining
by
the
employer
under
the
preliminary
grievance
procedures,
and
goes
to
the
point
of
inconsistency
with
the
congressional
prohibition
of
compulsory
arbitration,
when
the
arbitration
can
no
longer
be
called
a
creature
of
contract.
the
earlier
steps--
