justice
stevens
mr.
abrams,
may
i
just
interrupt
for
a
second?
is
it...
am
i
not
correct
that
the
majority...
the
mississippi
supreme
court
was
divided...
the
majority
assumed
the
sixth
amendment
right
had
attached
and
held
it
had
been
waived?
justice
stevens
whereas
the
dissenters
thought
that...
relied
on
the
sixth
amendment
and
felt
it
had
not
be
waived.
justice
stevens
so
they
all
agreed
the
right
had
attached.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there?
do
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
he
was
an
out-of-state
person?
in
other
words,
under
your
mississippi
canons
of
ethic,
as
i
understand,
once
a
lawyer
has
been...
this
is
cited
in
the
dissenting
opinion
below,
once
a
lawyer
is
representing
a
person
there
is
an
ethical
obligation
not
to
communicate
without...
with
that
client
without
notice
to
opposing
counsel.
does
that
have
any
relevance
to
this
case?
justice
stevens
would
it
have
made
a
difference
if
it
had
been
the
prosecutor
himself
who
wanted
to
talk
to
him?
justice
stevens
he
is
not
in
effect
an
agent
of
the
prosecutor,
you
don't
think?
justice
stevens
apparently...
why
do
you
suppose
the
dissenting
opinion
made
so
much
of
the
canons
of
ethics,
then,
and
the
majority
didn't
disagree
at
all?
i
guess
you
do.
justice
stevens
well,
but
you
do
agree,
don't
you
that--
justice
stevens
--you
do
agree,
don't
you,
that
it
is
generally
unethical
for
a
lawyer
to
consult
with
an
adversary's
client
without
notice
to
the
other
lawyer?
justice
stevens
which
is
the
principal
point
he
was
making.
justice
stevens
oh,
but
mr.
white,
in
the
opinion
they
say
the
standard
for
determining
whether
or
not
a
defendant
has
waived
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
was
set
out
in
brewer
against
williams,
430
u.s.--
justice
stevens
--that
is
hardly
a
mississippi
case.
justice
stevens
and
then
they
argue
further
that
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
under
mississippi
law
had
attached.
that's...
the
mississippi
law
only
went
to
when
the
right
attached.
justice
stevens
and
then
they
are
talking
about
the...
is
the
right
to
counsel
in
the
mississippi
constitution
in
the
sixth
amendment,
or
is
it
in
some
other
amendment?
justice
stevens
so
when
they
use
sixth
amendment,
that
is
a
reference
to
the
federal
constitution?
justice
stevens
that's
rather
clear,
i
think.
justice
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
the
edwards
argument
for
just
a
moment?
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
conceded
that
if
the
police
went
back
a
second
time
after
he'd
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
counsel
over
the
weekend
and
been
advised
not
to
talk
to
the
police,
and
said
we
want
to
talk
to
you,
and
he
had
said
no,
i
want
my
lawyer
present,
that
they
could
not
have
talked
to
him?
justice
stevens
but
why
do
you
concede
that?
because
as
i
understand
it,
you,
the
basic
proposition
you
are
advancing
in
this
case
is
that
having
been
advised
that
he
doesn't
have
to
talk
to
the
police,
which
is
presumably
the
advice
he
got
over
the
weekend,
that
is
all
the
protection
he
needs.
and
he
already
had
that
protection.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
tension
between
you...
that
concession
and
your
basic
position.
justice
stevens
why
can't
they
go
ahead
and
still
read
him
the
miranda
warnings
and
start
asking
him
questions?
because
he
has
got
the
advice
of
counsel
then.
why
does
he
have
to
be
told
a
second
time
he
shouldn't
talk
to
them?
justice
stevens
but
you're
interpreting
it
as
a
right
to
have
counsel
present,
not
merely
a
right
to
be
advised
by
counsel
and
have
counsel
available?
justice
stevens
--just
keep...
not
use
force,
of
course,
but
just
try
to
persuade
him
to
change
his
mind.
that's
all.
justice
stevens
that
would
have
ended
the
matter.
and
then
they,
if
they'd
done
it
a
third
time
and
that
time
he
gave
in,
you
say
well,
they
would
be
badgering
him.
but
i
would
suppose
you
would
then
argue
he
not
only
had
counsel
once,
he
had
him
twice,
so
it
is
definitely
voluntary.
the
more
often
he
talks
to
counsel,
the
more
voluntary
the
statement
is
when
made
outside
the
presence
of
counsel.
the...
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
he
refused
to
sign
a
waiver?
justice
stevens
well,
he
refused,
but
the
police
kept
after
him
and
he
finally
talked
without
signing
a
waiver.
