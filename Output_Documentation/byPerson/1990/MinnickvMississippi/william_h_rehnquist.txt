chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-6332,
robert
s.
minnick
v.
mississippi.
mr.
abrams,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
also
undisputed
that
he
had
seen
counsel
in
the
interim.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
is
pretty
much
dicta,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
there
is
language
in
edwards,
mr.
abrams,
i
just
look
at
what
was
quoted
here
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
its...
where
they
say
we
further
hold
that
the
accused,
having
expressed
his
desire
to
deal
with
the
police
only
through
consult,
is
not
subject
to
further
interrogation
by
the
authority
until
counsel
has
been
made
available
to
him.
now
here
counsel
was
made
available
to
him.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
counsel
made
available
to
him.
are
you
saying
that
seeing
the
lawyer
in
the
interim
was
not
making
counsel
available
to
him?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
defendant
can't
change...
if
he
said
on
friday
i
want
to
have
the
interrogation
only
with
a
lawyer,
he
sees
the
lawyer,
they
come
back,
and
he
can't
change
his
mind?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
he
has
seen
a
lawyer
in
the
meantime?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
abrams,
i
think
many
people
thought
miranda
itself
was
a
bight
line.
and
you
know,
and
we
know
perhaps
better
than
you
do,
we
don't
have
just
hundreds
of
miranda
petitions.
we
have
thousands
over
a
period
of
years.
every
sentence
and
every
clause
has
turned
on
its
own
little
jurisprudence.
so
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
deciding
this
case
one
way
or
another
is
going
to
diminish
the
amount
of
miranda
jurisprudence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
then
we've
had,
we've
had
discussions
as
to
whether,
what
was
reinterrogation.
we've
had
several
cases
involve
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
all
he
has
to
do,
all
he
has
to
do
is
tell
them
again
my
lawyer
told
me
not
to
say
anything.
i
am
not
saying
anything.
he--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--he
holds
the
keys
to
his
interrogation
right
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
have
never
said
that
after
he
has
seen
a
lawyer
we
won't
put
him
in
that
position.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
what
you're
asking
us
to
say
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
question
which
is
set
forth
as
the
question
presented
on
the
first
page
of
your
blue
brief,
is
that
the
same
question
as
contained
in
your--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--do
you
think
counsel
is
free
to
do
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
abrams.
mr.
white.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
the
proper
way
to
interpret
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
about
the
right
to
counsel
is
that
the
mississippi
law
respecting
the
right
to
counsel,
or
the
mississippi
law
respecting
the
initiation
of
prosecutions?
i
mean,
does
mississippi
have
a
more
liberal
provision
as
to
when
you
have
the
right
to
counsel
than
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
abrams.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-6332,
minnick
against
mississippi
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
