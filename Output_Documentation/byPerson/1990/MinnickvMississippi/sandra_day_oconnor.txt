justice
o'connor
mr.
white,
would
you
agree
that
if
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
had
attached,
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
that
right?
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
even
under
the
sixth
amendment.
i
thought
you
answered
me
to
the
contrary.
did
i
misunderstand
you
when
i
asked
you
about
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
o'connor
but
may
the
state
initiate--
--well,
can
the
police
initiate
it
like
they
did
here?
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
question.
i
thought
you
said
yes,
that
was
fine--
justice
o'connor
--under
the
sixth
amendment.
