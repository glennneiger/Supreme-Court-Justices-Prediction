justice
white
and
even
though
the
lawyer
has
told
him
not
to
talk.
justice
white
does
the
sixth
amendment
get
you
any
farther?
justice
white
what
if
you
lose
on
the
fifth?
justice
white
well,
assume
it
did--
--that's
your
argument
on
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
white
well,
that's--
justice
white
--if
you're
going
to
start
there--
justice
white
--so
that's
the
beginning
of
formal
proceedings?
justice
white
but
they
do
something
more
to
actually
bring,
to
start
the
proceeding
further.
they
file
complaints,
don't
they?
justice
white
or
they
indict,
or
have
preliminary
hearings?
justice
white
we
seem
to
have
put
a
lot
on
state
law
in
the
moore
case.
justice
white
and
referred
to
illinois...
was
it
illinois
law?
justice
white
even
though
the
police
approach
him,
and
he
is
at
first
reluctant
to
talk,
and
finally
they
get
him
to
talk?
justice
white
blurry?
how
do
you
read
jackson?
justice
white
well,
you
mean
it
isn't
blurry,
is
it?
justice
white
you
don't
think
jackson
bars
that?
justice
white
you
mean
that
the...
you
mean
the
accused
has
to
initiate
it?
justice
white
so
the
sixth
amendment
adds
nothing
to
the
case,
in
your
view?
justice
white
but
you
can
go
back
to
him
then.
justice
white
but
if
he
wants
counsel
he
means
he
doesn't
want
to
talk
to
the
police
without
counsel
present?
that
is
what
michigan...
that
is
what
somebody
said
in
michigan
against
mosley.
justice
white
well,
what
did
they
do?
make
an
appointment
for
the
second
meeting?
