justice
scalia
well,
it's
clear
it's
at
some
expense,
though.
i
mean,
it's
saying
we
won't
have
all
these
questions
about
questioning
the
defendant
because
basically
you
can't
question
the
defendant,
period.
justice
scalia
you
know,
it's
not
unimaginable
that
you
would.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
wouldn't
it
be
easier
to
have
a
bright-line
rule,
mr.
abrams,
so
we
don't
have
to
go
state
by
state.
i
mean,
just
one
nice
bright-line
federal
rule.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
i
assume
that
conscientious
counsel
would
probably
try
to
delay
conferring
with
his
client
as
long
as
possible,
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
for
sure.
he'd
tell
them,
you
know,
ask
for
a
lawyer
but
don't
talk
to
one.
that's
the
best
advice
that
a
criminal,
that
he
could
get.
that's
a
great
right
to
counsel,
isn't
it?
did
you...
do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
the
sixth
amendment
had
attached
in
this
case...
and
by
the
way,
do
you,
did
you
concede
that
it
had
attached?
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
what
they
are
saying
is
they
are
not
relying
on
federal
law
for
their
determination
of
when
it
attaches.
but
they
are
making
it
clear
that
they
think
that
when
it
does
attach,
federal
law
comes
along
with
it,
that
is,
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
you
may
argue
against
that,
and
maybe
that
is
not
their
call,
it
is
probably
our
call
rather
than
theirs.
justice
scalia
mr.
white,
can
i
pursue
what
justice
stevens
was
asking
you?
as
i
understand
your
position,
somehow
if
he
says
i
want
a
lawyer
present
at
the
interrogation,
you
say
they
have
to
stop
right
away.
although
if
he
just
said
i
don't
want
to
talk,
you
would
still
allow
them
to
say,
oh,
come
on,
why
won't
you?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.
abrams,
that's
really
an
accurate
statement
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
position,
that
under
mississippi
law
minnick's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
attached
at
the
time
of
the
interview.
justice
scalia
the
issue
before
us
today
is
whether
under
federal
law
minnick's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
attached.
justice
scalia
it
happens
when
the
mississippi
supreme
court
says
it
happens?
