thought
somebody

him
he

to
go
down
and
talk.
justice
marshall
but
didn't
they,
didn't
they
tell
him
he
had
to
go
and
he
had
to
talk
to
the
man?
justice
marshall
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
telling
the
man
in
the
courtroom
that
he
doesn't
have
to
talk,
telling
a
man
in
the
street
that
he
doesn't
have
to
talk,
and
telling
him
in
a
jail
that
he
does
have
to
talk.
isn't
there
a
difference?
justice
marshall
and
isn't
there
also
a
difference?
when
a
man
is
out
on
bail
you
can't
do
any
of
this.
justice
marshall
so
solely
because
he
hadn't
got
money
enough
for
bail
he
is
subjected
to
all
of
these
things.
