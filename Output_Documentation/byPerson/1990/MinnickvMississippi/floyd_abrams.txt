mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
capital
case
that
raises
issues
about
the
adherence
by
the
state
of
mississippi
to
this
court's
rulings
in
edwards
v.
arizona
and
michigan
v.
jackson.
the
relevant
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
arrested
in
california
on
the
basis
of
capital
murder
warrants
issued
in
mississippi,
mr.
minnick
was
questioned
by
the
fbi.
his
interrogation
was
on
a
friday.
mr.
minnick
spoke
with
the
agents
about
his
escape
from
a
mississippi
prison,
and
refused
to
respond
to
certain
questions
about
two
mississippi
homicides
for
which
he
had
been
arrested.
clearly,
expressly,
and
unambiguously,
minnick
on
three
separate
occasions
told
the
agents
that
he
wished
to
have
an
attorney.
minnick's
language,
as
recorded
by
the
agents,
and
in
response
to
their
inquiry
and
their
warning
to
him
that
he
didn't
have
to
speak
unless
his
lawyer
was
present,
was
that
they
should
"come
back
monday
when
i
have
a
lawyer.
"
at
which
time
he
said
he
would,
quote...
this
is
from
the
fbi
report,
"make
a
more
complete
statement
then
with
his
lawyer
present.
"
the
fbi
agents
immediately
discontinued
questioning.
mr.
minnick
spoke
to
assigned
counsel
over
the
weekend.
early
monday
morning,
a
sheriff
from
mississippi
appeared
at
the
jail.
minnick's
jailers
told
him
that
he
had
to
go
downstairs
and
talk
to
him,
and
that
he
could
not
refuse.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
made
a
precise,
factual
finding,
not
in
dispute
on
this
appeal,
that,
quote,
"the
jailers
told
minnick
that
he
would
have
to
go
down
and
talk
with
denham.
"
who
was
the
sheriff.
deputy
denham,
who
testified
that
he
had
with
him
a
copy
of
the
fbi
interview
report,
the
report
i
referred
to
earlier,
read
minnick
the
statement
of
his
miranda
rights.
according
to
deputy
denham,
minnick,
after
first
referring
to
and
answering
questions
about
his
escape
from
the
mississippi
jail,
then
made
certain
inculpatory
statements
about
his
role
in
the
homicide.
those
statements
were
introduced
at
trial
and
were
referred
to
throughout
the
trial
by
the
prosecutor
in
a
case
which
wound
up
with
a
finding
of
capital
murder
and
the
death
sentence
being
imposed.
not
at
issue,
then,
in
this
case
are
the
facts
that
mr.
minnick
not
only
asked
for
counsel,
but
asked
for
counsel
to
be
present
at
any
resumption
of
his
interrogation.
not
at
issue
is
the
fact
that,
notwithstanding
that
explicit
request
on
his
part,
he
was
required
to
meet
with
the
mississippi
sheriff
without
his
counsel
present,
after
his
jailers
told
him
that
he
had
to
talk
with
denham
and
after
they
brought
him
down
to
see
denham.
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case,
as
has
sometimes
arisen
before
this
court,
involving
anything
which
conceivably
be
viewed
as
reinitiation
by
minnick
of
discussions
with
the
mississippi
sheriff.
he
was
brought
down
against
his
will
to
meet
with
him,
after
he
had
counsel,
after
he
had
asked
for
counsel
to
be
present
at
any
resumption
of
any...
of
any
interrogation
being
resumed
and
questioned
by
the
sheriff.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
in
the
interim.
i
am
sorry
if
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
over
the
weekend
he
saw
counsel
and
spoke
with
counsel.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
not
undisputed
that
it
is
voluntary--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
find
that
a
difficult
question,
justice
kennedy,
because
even
the
mississippi...
the
mississippi
supreme
court
did
not
make
any
specific
finding
on
that,
except
that
minnick
had
waived,
in
their
view,
his
sixth
amendment
rights
and,
perhaps
implicitly,
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
the
rule
i
am
advocating
to
you,
and
the
rule
that
we
believe
that
the
edwards
case,
the
jackson,
have
already
established,
is
that
whatever
happens,
however
voluntary
it
may
be,
after
the
resumption
by
the
authorities,
is
inadmissible.
the
core
question
in
the
case,
then,
is
whether
these
allegedly
inculpatory
statements
made
by
minnick
on
the
occasion
of
the
reinterrogation
he
was
required
to
attend
can
serve
the
basis...
as
a
basis
for
his
conviction
and
execution.
in
our
view,
if
the
court
please,
this
case
is
governed
by
and
indeed
controlled
by
this
court's
ruling
in
edwards
v.
arizona
in
its
fifth
amendment
aspects,
and
in
its
sixth
amendment
aspects,
its
ruling
of
a
similar
nature
in
michigan
v.
jackson.
as
we
understand
those
cases,
they
conclude
that
the
police,
in
a
situation
in
which
an
individual
states
that
he
wishes
to
consult
with
counsel,
must
cease
the
interrogation
at
that
time,
and
that
it
may
not
be
resumed
unless
the
defendant
or
the
accused
himself
has
reinitiated
further
communications
with
the
authorities.
in
a
sense
the
issue
raised,
as
we
view
it,
is
even
narrower
than
that,
because
in
this
case
mr.
minnick
not
only
explicitly
sought
counsel,
but
explicitly
requested
counsel's
presence
at
any
resumption
of
the
interrogation.
the
basic
issue
that
divides
us
here
is
then
plain
enough.
it
is
the
position
of
both
mississippi
and
the
united
states,
that
since
minnick
had
access
to
counsel
over
the
weekend,
since
he
did
speak
to
counsel
over
the
weekend,
that
that
suffices
to
meet
the
constitutional
requirements
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
we
believe
that
as
a
reading
of
this
court's
precedence,
that
it
is
a
misreading,
that
miranda
itself
determined
that
if
an
individual
states
he
wants
an
attorney,
interrogation
must
cease
until
an
attorney
is
present.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
it
is
dicta,
but
it
is
then
read
in,
as
we
read
the
edwards
case,
your
honor,
as
a
good
part
of
the
rationale
for
edwards
itself.
that
is
to
say,
in
edwards
when
the
court
considers
miranda,
the
court
then
states
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
identified
in
miranda
is
the
right
to
have
counsel
present
at
any
custodial
interrogation.
we
think
that
that
conclusion
in
edwards
itself,
which
is
the
case
that
we
really
rely
upon
here,
is
a
significant
part
at
the
least,
your
honor,
of
the
court's
reaching
its
final
conclusion
in
edwards.
at
the
core
of
edwards,
as
we
understand
this
court
to
have
repeated
it
again
and
again
through
the
years,
is
the
unique
role
that
a
lawyer
can
play
in
protecting
fifth
amendment
rights
of
a
client
undergoing
interrogation.
that
phrase
is
one
which
has
recurred
with
frequency
as
this
court
has
explained
the
purport
of
edwards
itself.
in
roberson
v.--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--and
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
before
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
edwards
at
least,
is
the
meaning
of
that
phrase,
and
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
in
context.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
read
counsel
available
to
him
in
the
context
of
this
language,
your
honor,
as
counsel
available
to
him
at
the
interrogation.
and
i,
with
all
respect
i
urge
upon
you
that
in
the
context
of
the
two
paragraphs
from
which
the
mississippi
supreme
court
quoted
that
phrase,
that
that
is
the
only
fair
reading.
if
i
may,
the
court
said
in
edwards
we
now
hold
that
when
the
accused
has
invoked
his
right
to
have
counsel
present
during
custodial
interrogation,
a
valid
waiver
of
that
right
cannot
be
established
by
showing
only
that
he
responded
to
further
police-initiated
custodial
interrogation,
even
if
he
has
been
advised
of
his
rights.
we
further
hold,
and
this
is
the
sense
of
the
question,
that
an
accused,
such
as
edwards,
having
expressed
his
desire
to
deal
with
the
police
only
through
counsel,
is
not
subject
to
further
interrogation
by
the
authorities
until
counsel
has
been
made
available
to
him,
unless
the
accused
himself
initiates
further
communication.
and
then
the
court
says,
as
if,
i
would
urge
upon
you,
as
if
to
clear
up
any
potential
ambiguity
in
the
language,
"miranda
itself
indicated
that
the
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel
was
a
significant
event,
and
that
once
exercised
by
the
accused
the
interrogation
must
cease
until
an
attorney
is
present.
"
"our
later
cases
have
not
abandoned
that
view.
"
in
case
after
case...
i
appreciate
that
language
is
used
sometimes
which
the
court
when
it
considers
an
issue
narrowly
may
decide
that
it
had
not
phrase
as
felicitously
as
it
might
have.
but
in
case
after
case
decided
after
edwards
in
which
this
court
has
summarized
the
core
of
edwards,
it
has
done
so
in
a
fashion
consistent
at
least
with
the
reading
that
we
offer
to
you
today.
when,
for
example
in
patterson
v.
illinois,
the
court
was
summarizing
edwards,
it
said
that
the
essence
of
both
edwards
and
jackson
was
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
an
accused's
choice
to
communicate
with
the
police
only
through
counsel.
it
is
not
communicating
with
the
police
only
through
counsel
if
all
you
have
is
a
consultation
with
counsel
over
the
weekend,
and
at
the
interrogation
itself
counsel
is
not--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--absolutely,
he
can
change
his
mind.
and
indeed,
your
honor,
i
read
it
as
the
holding
of
edwards
that
he
can
change
his
mind,
but
that
he
has
to
reinitiate
communications
if
he
does.
mr.
floyd
abrams
even
though
he
has
seen
a
lawyer
in
the
meantime.
that
is
what
we
argue
here.
mr.
floyd
abrams
even
though
the
lawyer
has
told
him
not
to
talk.
it
isn't
the
same
as
the
lawyer
being
at
the
interrogation.
a
lawyer
at
the
interrogation
can
play
all
the
different
roles
that
this
court
has
indicated
in
all
its
different
opinions
at
an
interrogation
itself.
and
it
simply
doesn't
fulfill
the
same
function
of
the
lawyer
at
the
interrogation
if
the
lawyer
simply
talks
to
the
person
in
advance.
it
seems
to
me
that...
for
example,
if
one
were
to
ask
the
question
what
could
a
lawyer
do
for
him
at
the
interrogation?
why
is
it
really...
i
mean
in
the
real
world,
why
is
it
different
if
a
lawyer
had
been
at
this
interrogation
or
had
been
with
him
at
that
time?
i
would
urge
on
you
that
that's,
i
think,
a
fair
question.
one
answer
is
that
a
lawyer
would
have
told
him
they
can't
make
you
go
down
and
talk
to
them.
they
can't
make
you
go
down
when
you
don't
want
to
go
down.
they
can't
make
you
leave
your
cell
and
go
down.
they
can't
make
you
"talk
to
them",
as
the
jailer
told
him
that
he
had
to
do.
the
lawyer
would
tell
him
sheriff
denham
is
not
your
friend.
sheriff
denham,
who
is
going
to
talk
to
you
about
your
mama
back
home,
wants
to
execute
you.
and
the
lawyer
who
is
standing
with
him
can
play
that
sort
of
role.
and
as
a
lawyer,
he
could
explain
to
minnick
when
questions
were
asked
which
minnick,
according
to
sheriff
denham,
answered,
he
could
explain
to
minnick
that
it
might
not
be
a
defense
for
mr.
minnick,
even
if
the
alleged
confession
was
exactly
what
minnick
said,
it
might
not
be
a
defense
for
him
if
in
fact
the
other
individual
accused
and
convicted
of
murder
had
killed
one
person
and
put
a
gun
to
minnick's
head
and
say
you
have
to
kill
the
other
person
or
i'm
going
to
kill
you.
a
lawyer
present
there
would
have
played
a
role,
and
a
lawyer
in
advance
simply
cannot
play
that
role.
and
our
view
is,
your
honor,
then
it
not
only
makes
a
difference
in
this
case,
it
makes
a
major
difference
in
terms
of
what
edwards
and
jackson
and
roberson
and
a
flock
of
precedence
of
this
court
will
be
understood
to
have
meant.
it
would
also
lead,
if
this
decision
were
to
be
affirmed,
to
a
significant
moving
away
from,
at
the
least,
what
this
court
has
more
than
once
referred
to
as
the
bright-line
rule
of
edwards.
edwards
is
at
the
very
least
clear,
comprehensible,
understood
by
police.
there
have
not
been
many
cases
about
it.
if
that
is
abandoned
in
this
type
situation,
there
simply
is
no
doubt
that
we
will
wind
up
with
minnick
hearings
burdening
the
courts
for
years
to
come,
and
every
prosecutor
will...
why
would
he
not...
want
to
reinterrogate
an
individual
after
he
saw
his
lawyer,
without
the
lawyers
present.
what,
what
good
prosecutor
wouldn't
want
to
do
that,
wouldn't
try
to
do
that?
mr.
floyd
abrams
you
have
had
a
lot
of
miranda
jurisprudence,
as
i
understand
it,
and
as
i
hear
you,
your
honor.
you
really
haven't
had
a
lot
of
edwards
jurisprudence.
you
have
had
edwards
jurisprudence
on
retroactivity
and
the
like.
edwards
has
worked.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
just
know
of
one,
but
i
am
sure
i
may
have
missed
them.
what
you
would
have
if
you
ruled
against
us
here
are
hearings
which
we
do
not
now
have
in
the
legal
system,
which
relate
to
how
often
the
prosecutors
went
back
to
the
cell
to
seek
to
reinterrogate
him
after
he
saw
his
lawyer,
how
hard
the
prosecutor
came
on--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that's
all
he
had
to
do--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that
is
all
he
had
to
do
in
edwards.
mr.
floyd
abrams
but
that's
all
he
had
to
do
in
roberson.
that's
all
he
had
to
do
in
a
flock
of
cases
in
this
court
in
which,
as
i
read
the
court's
jurisprudence,
what
you
have
said
is
we
will
not
put
an
accused
who
is
in
a
custodial
situation
into
that
position--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--absolutely
not.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
right.
but
if
you
compare
this
case
to
cases
like
smith
v.
illinois
or
roberson
v.
arizona,
i'd
submit
to
you
that
this
is
an
easier
case
in
terms
of
adherence
to
the...
a
core
principle,
as
we
read
it
at
least,
of
edwards
and
jackson
than
either
of
those
harder
cases
were.
we
don't
deal
here
with
a
separate
crime.
we
don't
deal
here
with
a
situation
where
in
smith
all
the
prosecutor
did,
all
the
policemen
did
was
to
finish
reading
miranda.
and
that
was
held
to
go
too
far
consistently
with
edwards.
one
of
the
advantages
of
edwards,
not
the
only
one,
one
of
the
advantages
that
this
court
has
more
than
one
remarked
upon,
more
than
once
remarked
upon,
is
the
fact
that
that
lays
down
clear
rules,
and
you
have
not
had
problems
of
a
serious
nature
in
interpretation
of
those
rules.
and
perhaps
at
least
as
important,
the
lower
courts
have
not
been
burdened--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--justice
scalia,
every
bright-line
rule
imposes
a
cost,
and
i
don't
deny
that
for
a
moment.
the
edwards
rule,
by
its
nature,
jackson,
miranda,
all
these
cases,
by
their
nature...
every
time
you
establish
a
prophylactic
rule
you
are
assuming
or
understanding
when
you
do
it
that
there
might
be
on
the
periphery
some
confessions
here
that
might
otherwise
have
been
admissible,
but
which
you
are
ruling
to
be
inadmissible.
and
that,
i
agree
with
you,
that
comes
with
the
territory.
i
don't
think
i
am
asking
you
to
expand
the
territory
at
all.
the
united
states
and
mississippi
take
the
position
that
we
are
seeking
some
sort
of
extension
of
the
edwards
case,
or
expansion
of
the
edwards
case.
with
all
respect,
that
is
the
normal
rhetoric
of
cases
of
this
sort.
one
side
says
i'm
just
adhering
to
it;
the
other
side
says
you
are
seeking
to
expand
it.
i
will
go
one
more.
i
think
they
are
trying
to
contract
it.
i
think
that
what
is
really
involved
here
is
that
they
are
attacking
the
core
of
these
cases
themselves.
so--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
don't
think
we
really
need
the
sixth
amendment,
your
honor.
we
do
argue
it
because
if,
for
any
reason--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--if
we
lose
on
the
fifth--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that's
why
we
need
it,
and
that's
why...
that's
why
we
argued
it.
i
understand
them
to
make
two
sixth
amendment
arguments,
and
neither
of
them
is
the
core
argument
that
we
have
been
discussing
so
far
today.
they
do
not
maintain,
and
i
don't
think
they
could
seriously
maintain,
that
if
the
sixth
amendment
governs
this
case,
that
because
counsel
had
been
spoken
to
over
the
weekend,
his
sixth
amendment
rights
had
been
adhered
to.
no
sixth
amendment
case
offers
any
support
of
that.
they
make
two
arguments
against
our
sixth
amendment
argument.
first
they
claim
we
didn't
raise
it
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
i
don't
have
anything
more
to
say
about
that
than
what
we
said
in
our
responsive
papers.
we
did
not
phrase
it
in
terms
of
either
the
fifth
or
sixth
amendment.
we
referred
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
michigan
v.
jackson,
which
is
a
sixth
amendment
case.
their
response,
the
state
of
mississippi's
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
interpreted
the
question
in
precisely
this
fashion.
in
their
brief
in
opposition
they
said
that
what
was
at
issue
here
is,
quote,
"petitioner's
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
were
not
violated
by
the
admission
of
his
confession
into
evidence.
"
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
your
honor,
it
is
a
rewritten,
i
thought
a
clearer
form
of
the
question.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
understand
from
rule
24
that
so
long
as
we
are
not
expanding
the
scope
of
what
is
before
the
court,
fairly
presented
to
you,
that
if
we
can
state
it
in
a
fashion
which
fairly
presents
what
was
before
you
at
the
time
of
the
petition
for
cert.,
that
we
are
permitted
to
do
that.
and
we
think
we
have
done
just
that,
your
honor.
the
precise
question
as
it
was
phrased
in
the
petition
for
cert.,
we
referred
to
neither
amendment.
i
thought
it
was
helpful
to
try
to
put
that
in,
or
when...
i
didn't
work
on
the
petition
itself...
the
petition
says
whether,
once
an
accused
has
expressed
his
desire
to
deal
with
law
enforcement
officers
only
through
counsel,
the
police
may
reinitiate
interrogation
in
the
absence
of
counsel
as
soon
as
the
accused
has
completed
one
consultation
with
the
lawyer.
i
think
that
fairly
encompasses
fifth
and
sixth
amendment--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--the
argument
on
the
sixth
amendment
is
that
if
we
are
right,
your
honor,
that
his
sixth
amendment
rights
had
attached--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--which
is
the
point
i
would
like
to
address.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
i
was
simply
starting
with
the
proposition
that
if
we're
over
that
hurdle,
we
don't
think
we
have
any
other
hurdle,
because
they
do
not
argue,
and
can't,
that
consultation
with
a
lawyer
over
the
weekend
satisfies
the
sixth
amendment.
our
position
on
the
attachment
point,
your
honor,
is...
is
this.
it
is
perfectly
true,
it
is
undeniable
that
that
is
a
matter
of...
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
to...
in
any
determination
of
when
the
sixth
amendment
applies.
we
understand,
though,
and
it
is
our
position
to
you
that,
given
that
this
is
a
state
prosecution,
given
the
fact
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
held
in
this
case
and
before,
and
that
indeed
the
state
of
mississippi
so
argued
before
the
mississippi
supreme
court
that
the
right
had
attached
under
mississippi
law,
and
therefore,
in
the
language
of
kirby
v.
illinois
from
this
court,
that
mississippi
was
committed
to
prosecute
on
the
issuance
of
the
arrest
warrant.
not
the
later
time
when,
undeniably--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--in
mississippi.
and
that
is
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held
in
this
case,
and
that
it
has
held
in
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief
as
well.
the
argument
against
us
is
that
there
ought
to
be
one
body
of
law,
the
federal
law,
which
has
basically
been
established
in
certain
precedence
of
this
case.
we
think
that
when
you
have
a
state
prosecution
that
it
does
lie
with
the
state
to
make
a
decision
as
to
when
it
has
committed
to
prosecute.
and
there
are
reasons
unique
to
mississippi
set
forth
in
its
jurisprudence
as
to
why
under
mississippi
law
that
right
attaches
earlier.
the
rural
nature
of
the
state,
the
fact
that
as
a
matter
of
common
practice
indictments
are
issued
long
after
all
the
work--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
they...
yes.
but
what
they
have
concluded,
here
and
elsewhere,
what
they
have
concluded
is
that
the
issuance
of
the
arrest
warrant
under
mississippi
law
is
the
moment
at
which
this
right
attaches.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
are
some
times
when
federalism
comes
in
more
than
handy,
and
i
think
that
this
is
one.
this
court
has
not
had
this
issue
before
really
at
all.
in
kirby
v.
illinois
the
court
set
forth
five
different
times
when
it
could
be
said
that
the
right
attaches,
and
has
never
addressed
the
question
in
a
state
context.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
all
of
them
agreed
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
had
attached,
and
the
state
of
mississippi
so
urged
that
position
on
them.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
yes.
and
we
cited
that
to
you,
and
we
think
that
it's
a
fair
cite
for
that
proposition.
and
indeed
we
think
kirby
itself
suggests
that
reliance
on
state
law
would
be
proper
here.
so
our
view
in
the
end...
i'll
just
take
a
final
second.
we
think
you
could
write
an
opinion
reversing
this
opinion
which
is
no
more
than
a
series
of
quotations
from
the
opinions
you
have
written
in
this
area.
we
think
that
the
summaries
which
this
court
has
offered
through
the
years
of
what
edwards
means
and
why
edwards
exists
apply
on
all
fours
in
this
case.
there
is
an
enormous
difference
between
a
lawyer
being
present
and
a
lawyer
consulting,
and
we
urge
that
upon
you,
and
we
urge
you
to
reverse
this
conviction.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
there
was
no
ambiguity
in
what
mississippi
said
to
its
supreme
court
about
the
attachment
issue.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
ja
68
of
the
joint
appendix.
we
quote
there
from
the
brief
of
mississippi
to
their
supreme
court
in
which
they
said,
"it
is",
after
dealing
with
the
fifth
amendment
right
having
attached,
citing
edwards,
they
then
said
"it
is
also
evident
that
under
mississippi
law,
minnick's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
attached
at
the
time
of
the
interview
since
warrants
for
his
arrest
had
been
issued.
"
citing
livingston
v.
state.
that
was
the
position
of
mississippi.
if
their
position
now
were
that
they
were
wrong,
or
they
made
a
mistake,
or
they
are
changing
their
view,
i
would
be
more
sympathetic.
it
is
perfectly
clear,
it
is
not
a
subject,
it
should
not
be
a
subject
of
debate
that
that
is
what
they
said
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
nor
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
fully
aware
of
what
its
own
constitutional
provision
is.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
they
can
change
their
mind,
your
honor.
but
what
they
can't
do
is
change
retrospectively
the
mind
of
the
mississippi
court.
and
it
does
that
court
no
service
here
to
say
that
they
used
shorthand
when
they
talk
about
their
own
constitution.
justice
robertson
in
dissent,
for
example,
in
this
case
cited
article
iii
section
26
of
the
mississippi
constitution,
which
is
their
right
to
counsel
section.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
referred
to
the
sixth
amendment.
the
only
other
point
that
i--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
your
decision,
i
believe
justice
scalia,
is
whether
under...
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
for
you
to
decide
when
sixth
amendment
rights
attach,
and
that
it
is
the
federal
constitution
that
makes
that
decision.
i
think
it
is
state
law,
however,
which
is
relevant
in
determining
when
mississippi
makes
a
"commitment
to
prosecute",
or
when...
i
am
just
about
quoting
from
kirby...
"adversary
proceedings
have
begun",
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
those
are
mississippi
decisions,
i
believe,
not...
they
are
procedural
decisions,
almost
substantive
decisions.
but
they
are
mississippi
ones.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no.
it
happens
if
under
mississippi
law...
if
it
is
an
accurate
statement
to
make
to
you
that
adversary
proceedings
have
commenced
as
a
matter
of
mississippi
law,
or
that
mississippi
is,
quote,
committed,
unquote,
in
the
language
of
kirby
to
proceed,
then
that
is
what
i
think
that
you
should
look
to.
and
in
looking
to
that,
i
think
you
should
take
very
seriously
indeed
the
ruling
of
the
mississippi
court.
the
final
observation
i
would
make,
i
have
decided
not
to
make,
except
a
quote
from
one
line
from
arizona
v.
roberson,
in
which
this
court
said
that
new
miranda
warnings
will
not
reassure
a
suspect,
who
has
been
denied
the
counsel
he
has
clearly
requested,
that
his
rights
have
remained
untrammeled.
the
argument
you
have
just
heard
is
that
what
counsel,
what
minnick
asked
for
was
given
him.
hence
he
could
relax.
he
asked
for
counsel
to
be
present
at
the
reinterrogation.
that's
what
he
asked
for.
that
was
not
given
to
him.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
