mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
the
court
is
being
asked
to
determine
the
effect
of
counsel
actually
being
furnished
to
a
defendant
on
his
subsequent
waiver
of
his
right
to
counsel
in
a
renewed
contact
by
the
police.
the
state
contends
that
edwards
v.
arizona
allows
a
renewed
contact
by
police
after
counsel
has
been
made
available.
in
fact,
the
concluding
substantive
paragraph
in
edwards
points
out
that
the
statement
in
question
there
was
made
without
having
had
access
to
counsel,
and
therefore
did
not
amount
to
a
valid
waiver,
and
hence
was
inadmissible.
the
same
language
is
again
used,
or
similar
language
is
used
again
in
arizona
v.
roberson,
and
the
phrase
there
is
without
counsel
having
been
provided.
and
in
rhode
island
v.
innis
the
court
said
until
had
consulted
with
a
lawyer.
the
cases
use
the
terms,
those
terms...
or
that
term...
language
from
edwards
about
having
had
access
or
having
counsel
been
available
over
and
over.
the
factual
situation
in
this
case
at
bar
is
distinguishable,
of
course,
from
the
usual
edwards
scenario,
because
here,
after
minnick
told
the
fbi
agents
that
he
didn't
want
to
talk
further
until
speaking
with
his
lawyer,
they
ceased
questioning
and
left
him.
and
he
told
them
to
come
back
monday
and
he
would
give
a
more
detailed
statement
when
his
lawyer
was
present.
some
2
days
later,
after
he
had
consulted
with
his
attorney
by
his
own
admission
two
or
three
times
that
weekend,
not
just
a
brief
consultation,
but
he
had
met
with
counsel
two
or
three
times
over
the
weekend,
the
mississippi
deputy
sheriff
arrived
in
san
diego
and
requested
to
be
allowed
to
speak
with
minnick.
minnick
was
brought
to
the
interview
room
and
then--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
in
this,
and
i
think...
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
that
the,
in
that
particular,
in
this
particular
situation
that
mr.
denham
was
the
agent
of
any
lawyer
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it
could
have.
i
mean,
under
an
ethical
type
consideration
it
may
have.
but
that
was
not
the
case
here,
and
of
course
the--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no,
he
is
not.
we
would
not
submit
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
prosecution.
there
are
law
enforcement
officers...
our
people
are
sworn
offers
that
are...
actually
work
in
the
district
attorney's
offices
and
are
their
agents,
i
think.
but
just
the
police,
just
a
normal
deputy
sheriff,
or
a
policeman
i
don't
think
would
be
classed
as
an
agent
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
without
being
disrespectable
to
the
court
below,
we
don't...
that
particular
justice
and
i
don't
see
eye
to
eye
on
much
at
all
in
our
opinions
and
that,
and
this
is
i
think
an
extensive
ground
to--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--to
extend
those--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--sure.
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
so.
the
mississippi
deputy
arrived
in
san
diego,
and
of
course
advised
minnick
when
he
was
brought
into
the
questioning
room
of
his
rights
according
to
miranda.
minnick
gave
him
an
oral
waiver,
and
of
course
subsequently
gave
this
statement
implicating
himself
in
the
two
mississippi
murders
for
which
he
stands
convicted
now.
clearly
there
is
no
question
that
minnick
had
been
furnished
counsel.
by
his
own
admission
he
had
talked
to
counsel
on
two
or
three
occasions.
and
of
course
he
had
consulted
with
him
prior
to
reinitiation
of
interrogation
when
the
mississippi
authorities
arrived.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
agree.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
mean,
i
think
that
he
had
time
to
consult
with
his
counsel,
and
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
that
he
has
a
right
to
change
his
mind
and
to
talk
to
an
attorney...
i
mean
talk
to
the
police,
even
without
notice
to
his
counsel.
it
says
that
in
brewer
v.
williams
and
as
recently
as
in
michigan
v.
harvey
in
a
context--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--there
was
no...
well,
maybe
if
there
is
a
reluctance
to
talk,
but
there
was
no
reluctance
to
talk
in
this
case
when
he
saw
deputy
denham.
in
fact,
he
told
i
have
been
waiting
to
see
you.
i
have
been
expecting
you.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
think
the...
given
miranda
warnings
and
of
course
the
advice
of
counsel,
he
knew
he
didn't
have
to
go
down
there,
and
he--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
think
that
is
what
he
says
in
the
record,
yes,
sir.
but
the--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
think
that,
you
know,
the
bright
line
that
we
are
suggesting,
of
course,
is
that
once
counsel
has...
there's
been
a
consultation.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
that's,
that
would
be
something
to
be
determined.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it
would
be
a
consultation
in
which
the
attorney
had
an
opportunity
to
advise
that
client
of
just
i
think
what
you've
said.
i
think
that
a
telephone
call--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no.
i
don't
think
they
have
a
right
to
do
that
and
go
that
far.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
that
you--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
think
that
you
have
a
right
to
reapproach
and
ask
if
he
has
in
fact
consulted
with
counsel,
and
if
he
says
no
then
the
police
must
leave.
if
he
says
yes,
then
they
can
mirandize
him
again,
and
if
he
waives
the
right
to
counsel
at
that
point--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--he
must
leave,
or
wait
until
counsel
is
present.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
until
he
has
consulted
with
counsel
again
i
don't
think
that
he
would,
that
they
would
have
that
opportunity.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
there
again
i
think
you
get
into
the
analysis
much,
very
similar
to
that
of
michigan
v.
mosley
of
was
the
waiver
voluntary
at
that
point.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
no,
i
think
that
you
have
a
situation
that
the
number
of
times,
i
think,
would
all
go
to
then
a...
you
know,
how
many
times
did
they
go
back.
i
think
that
would
all
apply
to
a...
whether
the
waiver
was
voluntary.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
but
then
of
course
that...
that
of
course
impacts
on
the
voluntariness
of
that--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
don't
see
anything...
if
he
has
consulted
with
counsel
every
half
hour,
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that
may
be
the
outcome
of
that.
[laughter]
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
if
the
opinion
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
read,
which,
and
we
contend
that
the
shorthand
used
there
is
nothing...
deals
nothing
with
the
federal
sixth
amendment
rights,
it
says
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
under
mississippi
law
had
attached.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
the
line
is
much
blurrier
there
in
that
situation.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
jackson
is
pretty
specific
in
that...
in
that
area.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
not...
not
really,
but
i
think
that
with
the
furnishing
of
counsel
there,
i
think
that...
once
counsel
has
been
appointed
i
think
the
state
does
have
a
duty
to
stay
away.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
the
person
can
waive
at
anytime.
i
thought
that
was
your
question.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
they
could,
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
that
under
the
same
test
that
is
used
in
edwards,
which
it
says
is
adopting
the
edwards
test,
i
think
the
same
test
is
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
unless
counsel
has
been
provided
there.
but--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no,
it
doesn't.
in
fact
we,
it
is
our
firm
contention
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
has
not
even
attached
in
this
case,
because
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
mississippi
law,
contrary
to
what
mr.
abrams
has
said,
that
would--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--under
these
latest
decisions
of
the
state
constitution,
they...
the
opinions
dealing
with
this
specifically
say
we
reject
the
federal
approach,
and
say
that
we
are
not
relying...
we
might
be
citing
federal
cases,
but
we
reject
the
federal
law,
and
say
that
this
is
purely,
exclusively
done
under
state
law,
this
right
to
counsel.
they
use
this
shorthand
of
the
sixth
amendment,
i
am
afraid,
in,
just
as
a
shorthand
for,
instead
of
saying
section
26
or--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
agree.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--and
then
they
say--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--it
is
not
in
the
sixth
amendment
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--the
case
that
they
rely
on,
which
is
livingston
there,
states
clearly
that
they
are
not
relying
on
federal
law
to
find
that
right.
the...
as
i
say,
the
sixth
amendment...
using
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
a
clear
indication
that
the
federal
sixth
amendment
right
is
attached.
the
arrest
warrant
does
not
in
any
way
put
the,
put
a
state
to
the
burden
of
prosecuting
anybody.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
under
coleman
v.
alabama
it
is
your
call.
and
of
course
the
reason
in
coleman
v.
alabama,
they
say
we
look
to
the
state
law
to
see
when
those
guarantees
of
the
sixth
amendment
are
impinged
upon,
then,
you
know,
as
in
coleman,
there
they
say...
you
held
that
the
preliminary
hearing
was
the
stage
because
if
you
fail
to
raise
certain
defenses
at
that
point
you
would
lose
them
forever,
they
would
be
forever
waived.
so
they
said...
found
that
to
be
the
critical
point
where
the
right
to
counsel
attached,
and
therefore
the
sixth
amendment
came
into
play
there.
whereas
in
mississippi,
the
issuance
of
an
arrest
warrant...
this
was
kind
of
bootstrap
from
a
statute
of
limitations
statutes,
two
statute
of
limitations
statutes
setting
out
what
crimes
and
when
the
statute
of
limitations
had
begun
to
run.
the
statute
could
just
as
easily
have
said
that
the
statute
began
to
run
from
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
and
of
course
the
court
there
would
have
said
well,
the
sixth
amendment
attached
at
the
time
that
the
crime
was
committed.
that's...
that's
what
we're
saying,
that
from
the
point
of
federal
law
that
that
is
just
not...
not
a
reasonable
interpretation.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
in
saying
that
if
he
says
i
don't
want
to
talk
again,
that
they
can't
force
him
to
talk?
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
because
he
also
has
a
right
to
remain
silent
there,
and
i
think
that,
that
is,
that
involves
that,
the
right
to
silence
and
the
right
to
have
counsel
present.
and
if
he
wants
counsel
present,
then,
and
requests
counsel
to
be
present
at
that
time,
then
i
think
you
have
to
abide
by
that.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
i
think
he
has
a
right
not
to
talk
to
the
authorities
if
he
says
so.
and
he
says
no,
i
am
not
going
to
talk
to
you.
my
counsel
told
me
not
to
talk
to
you.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
way
that
the
state
would
have
a
right
to
go
on
and--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
that
you
would--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
am
sure
there
is,
i
think
there
is
a
difference,
yes.
but--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that
is
true.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
mr.
minnick
was
in
for
a
nonbailable
offense,
so
it
didn't
matter
one
way
or
the
other.
but
also
mr.
minnick
of
course
fancied
himself
as
a
jailhouse
lawyer,
and
that
is
very
clear
in
the
testimony
in
the
suppression
hearing,
that
he,
that
we
look
at
the
subjective
intent
and
characteristics
of
mr.
minnick
here--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no.
if
he
says
i
don't
want
to
talk,
i
think
there,
again,
that
is
saying
to
cut
it
off.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
i
mean,
if
someone
just
says...
in
the
normal
situation
if
they
do
not
request
an
attorney
under
michigan
v.
mosley
you
can
go
back
after
a
brief
period
of
time,
2
or
3
hours.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--maybe
i
wasn't
clear.
i
didn't
say
that
be
couldn't
waive
the
second
or
third
time.
i
am
saying
that
when
you
get
to
that
point
of
determining
how
many
times
they
went
back,
that
is
a
decision
to
be
made
from
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
whether
or
not
that
waiver
at
that
point
was
in
fact
voluntary.
i
mean,
you
get
to
the
point
of
badgering
there
that's...
you
know,
that's
what
we're
saying.
we're
not
saying
that
you
should
be
able
to
badger
this
person
by
continually
going
back,
but
i
think
that
a
fair
opportunity
to
go
back
at
that
time
should
be
allowed
by...
to
the
state.
we
submit
that
all
that
mr.
denham
would
have
had...
i
mean,
mr.
minnick
would
have
had
to
do,
here
when
deputy
denham,
or
when
he
was...
deputy
denham
came
into
the
room,
was
to
say
that
his
counsel
had
advised
him
not
to
talk
to
the
police,
or
that
he
had
counsel
and
wanted
him
present
before
he
talked.
and
that
would
have
ended
the
matter.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
think
he
was
following
that
much
of
his
attorney's
advice.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
this
was
not
one
where
they
just
kept
after
him.
this
was,
they
had
a
short
interview
on
friday,
and
then
the
interview
with
denham
on
monday
lasted
45
minutes
to
an
hour.
nobody
from
the
police
had
bothered
him
in
between
those
times.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
they
brought
him
down
to
the
room
there
when
the
mississippi
deputy
arrived
from
mississippi.
of
course
minnick
knew
full
well,
he
had
had
the...
that
he
did
not
have
to
talk
with
denham.
and
of
course
the,
it
is
clear
from
the
transcript
of
the
suppression
hearing
that
he
intended
to
talk
to
denham
about
this
case.
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
request
that
he
made
of
denham
to
have
counsel
present
would
not
be
honored.
his
earlier
request
for
counsel
had
been
honored,
and
there
was
no
reason
for
him
not
to
believe
that
this
would
not
be.
this,
of
course,
removes
that
coercive
atmosphere
that
is
the
concern
of
edwards
and
miranda,
that
once
a
defendant
has
requested
counsel
and
it
is
furnished,
then
he
has
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
not
be
furnished
again,
or
his
request
be
furnished
the
second
time
that
he
asks
that,
or
any
reinvocation
of
that
right.
so
therefore
the...
as
we
said
earlier,
that
the
bright-line
test
would
be
that
of
that
once
counsel
or
consultation
has
occurred,
then
the
police
could
reinitiate
conversations
with
the
defendant.
and
then
of
course
whether
or
not
that
waiver
of
rights...
waive
the
right
to
counsel
was
in
fact
voluntary
would
be
made
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
that
we
find
in
michigan
v.
mosley
for
that
similar
type
situation,
where
the
right
to
silence
was
invoked.
the
fact
that
a
request
has
been
honored
counteracts,
of
course,
the
pressures
of
the
custodial
setting,
and
actual
consultation
with
counsel
removes
i
think
to
an
even
greater
extent
than
just
leaving
the
person
alone
and
then
coming
back
several
hours
after
counsel
had
been...
not
been
appointed.
briefly,
on
the
sixth
amendment
issue,
i
think
we've
covered
most
of
it.
but
the
fact
that
based
on
these
two
statutes
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
at
the
time
the
arrest
warrant
issues,
the
fact
that
the
legislature
set
an
arbitrary
time
for
the
statute
to
begin
running,
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
turned
it
to
a
point
for
the
attachment
of
a
state
law
right
to
counsel
should
have
no
effect
on
when
the
federal
right
attaches.
while
it
is
true
that
we
look
to
the
state
court
law
to
make
the
determination
as
to
when
the
sixth
amendment
right
attaches,
the
examination
of
state
law
is
to
determine
at
what
point
rights
guaranteed
under
the
sixth
amendment
are
implicated.
in
mississippi
the
court
made
clear
the
opinions
leading
to
this,
we
consider,
unusual
holding,
that
it
rejected
the
federal
approach
and
relied
exclusively
on
state
law
in
citing
page
v.
state
and
cannaday
v.
state,
which
both
clearly
say
they
reject
federal
law
there.
the,
we
would
just
submit
that
the
issuance
of
an
arrest
warrant
does
not
commit
the
state
of
mississippi
to
prosecute
a
defendant,
and
therefore
the
federal
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
not
attached
in
this
case.
thank
you.
