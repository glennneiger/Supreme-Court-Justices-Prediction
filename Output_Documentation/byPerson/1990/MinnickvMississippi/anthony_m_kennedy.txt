justice
kennedy
can
we
say
that
it's
also
undisputed
that
this
confession
is
voluntary?
justice
kennedy
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i
should
have
said.
for
purposes
of
the
issue
presented
to
us,
we
can
assume
the
confession
was
fully
voluntary?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
rule
you
are
asking
us
to
adopt
certainly
is
a
rule
that
takes
no
account
of
the
fact
that
the
confession
was
fully
voluntary?
justice
kennedy
when
you
say
counsel
is
made
available,
suppose
there
is
a
telephone
call
between
the
prisoner
and
the
counsel,
and
the
counsel
says
i'll
be
there
tomorrow.
i
am
busy,
don't
talk
to
anybody.
is
that
counsel
being
available?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
is
a
consultation?
justice
kennedy
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
that's
a
very
bright
line.
justice
kennedy
so
then
before
the
police
know
whether
they
can
initiate
a
conversation
they
have
to
say
now,
did
you
talk
with
the
counsel
and
what
did
you
talk
about?
justice
kennedy
well,
how
would
they...
how
are
they
going
to
know?
justice
kennedy
how
is
the
rule
going
to
be
applied?
justice
kennedy
what
if
he
says
yes,
and
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you
without
counsel?
justice
kennedy
until
counsel
comes
in
next
time,
or
can
they
go
back
in
a
half
hour?
justice
kennedy
so
there
is
kind
of
a
series
of
leapfrog,
one-shot
attempts
by
the
police,
and
every
time
he
says
i
want
my
counsel,
then
they'd
wait
until
he
talks
with
him
on
the
telephone
again,
and
then
they
can
go
back?
justice
kennedy
no,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
police
can...
can
initiate
the
conversation.
and
you
indicated
that
if
he
once
had
seen
counsel,
insisted
on,
at
the
time
the
police
first
contacted
again
that
he
wanted
counsel
again,
that
the
police
had
to
desist,
and
i
thought
your
rule
was
until
he
consulted
counsel
a
second
time.
justice
kennedy
well,
then
you
are
saying
then
they
can
go
back
as
many
times
as
necessary
in
order
to
get
him
to
change
his
mind?
justice
kennedy
well,
assume
it's
voluntary.
they
just
go
by
every
half
hour.
justice
kennedy
but
you
don't
concede
in
this
court
that--
justice
kennedy
--that
the
federal
right
had
attached.
but
if
it
has,
if
it
has
attached
or
did
attach,
do
you
say
that
the
state
may
then
initiate
an
interrogation?
justice
kennedy
i
must
say
i'm
still
puzzled
by
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
and
to
me.
he
gets
arrested.
he
asks
for
counsel.
he
sees
counsel.
the
police
go
back.
he
says
i
want
counsel.
your
answer,
as
i
understood
it,
was
they
can't
talk
to
him
anymore,
at
least
until
he
sees
the
counsel
a
second
time,
and
then
they
can
go
back
one
more
time.
justice
kennedy
and
to
me,
if...
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
that
he
can
waive
counsel
when
they
asked
him
the
first
time,
but
they
can't,
he
can't
waive
it
when
they
ask
him
the
second
or
third.
why
not?
that's
the
whole
theory
of
your
case,
that
he
is
well
advised
so
that
he
can
waive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
court's
opinion
in
minnick
versus
mississippi.
the
case
is
before
us
as
a
capital
case
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
in
edwards
versus
arizona,
we
held
that
once
a
suspect
in
police
custody
invokes
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
he
may
not
be
questioned
further
unless
his
lawyer
is
present
or
unless
the
suspect
himself
initiates
the
conversation.
this
is
true
even
if
the
suspect
is
given
new
miranda
warnings
before
he
makes
the
statement.
today's
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
edwards'
bar
to
further
interrogation
applies
after
the
suspect
has
conferred
with
his
counsel.
petitioner,
robert
minnick,
was
arrested
in
california
for
two
murders
committed
in
mississippi.
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
interviewed
minnick
in
a
san
diego
jail.
the
interview
ended
when
the
petitioner
asked
the
questioning
cease
until
he
had
a
lawyer
present,
a
right
identified
by
this
court
in
miranda
versus
arizona.
between
saturday,
the
day
of
the
fbi
interview,
and
the
following
monday,
minnick
conferred
with
the
lawyer
on
two
or
three
occasions.
then
on
monday,
a
mississippi
deputy
sheriff
again
interrogated
minnick.
minnick
did
not
initiate
the
interview
and,
in
fact,
testified
that
he
jailers
told
him
he
could
not
refuse
to
talk
to
the
deputy.
his
lawyer
was
not
present
during
questioning
and
minnick
made
incriminating
statements
that
were
used
against
him
in
his
mississippi
murder
trial.
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
determined
that
edwards
does
not
apply
once
the
suspect
has
consulted
with
an
attorney
and
then
response
to
questions
after
new
miranda
warnings.
we
now
reverse.
our
cases
interpret
the
edwards
rule
to
bar
police-initiated
interrogation
unless
the
accused
has
counsel
with
him
at
the
time
of
questioning.
the
exception
proposed
by
the
state
of
mississippi
is
inconsistent
with
edwards'
purpose
to
protect
the
suspect's
right
to
have
counsel
present
at
custodial
interrogation.
the
exception
would
undermine
the
advantages
flowing
from
edwards'
clear
and
unequivocal
character.
under
the
formulation
of
the
rule
proposed
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
the
protection
of
edwards
could
pass
in
and
out
of
existence
multiple
times
prior
to
arraignment.
moreover,
consultation
is
not
a
precise
concept
where
it
may
encompass
variations
from
a
telephone
call
to
say
that
the
attorney
is
on
route
to
see
the
client
to
a
hurried
interchange
between
the
attorney
and
the
client
in
a
detention
facility
corridor,
to
a
lengthy
in-person
conference.
the
inquiries
necessary
to
determine
whether
a
particular
consultation
was
sufficient
to
permit
further
interrogation
could
interfere
with
the
attorney-client
privilege.
in
addition,
the
proposal
would
have
the
disturbing
consequence
that
a
suspect
whose
counsel
is
prompt
would
lose
the
protection
of
edwards,
while
one
whose
counsel
is
a
dilatory
would
not.
we
hold,
then,
that
when
counsel
is
requested,
interrogation
must
cease
and
officials
may
not
re-interrogate
without
counsel
present
whether
or
not
the
accused
has
had
consultations
with
his
attorney.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joins;
justice
souter
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
of
decision
of
the
case.
