justice
white
what's
your
position
of
why
a
defendant
who
is
of
the
same
race
as
the
excluded
juror,
why
does
he
have
standing
to
raise
that
issue
at
all,
even
though
he
is
of
the
same
race?
justice
white
but
why
does...
why
does
any
of
them
have
standing?
justice
white
you
think
it...
must
he
prove
some
obvious
injury
to
himself?
justice
white
to
him.
justice
white
what
is
it?
justice
white
you
think
this...
that
sounds
like
a
sixth
amendment
claim.
justice
white
what
is
it?
justice
white
you
mean
in...
who...
what
other
person
is
treated
better?
justice
white
yeah,
but
i'm
talking
about
a
black
defendant...
i'm
talking
about
a
black
defendant
challenging
the
exclusion
of
a
black.
what
is
his
injury
in
fact?
justice
white
and
you
says
it's
an
equal
protection
challenge?
justice
white
as
compared
to
whom
is
he
being
treated
worse?
justice
white
so
you're...
you
give
the
same
answer
when
you
say,
when
you
describe
the
standing
of
the
white
defendant...
i
mean
the
white
plaintiff...
or
the
white
defendant
challenging
the
exclusion
of
a
black.
he
has
been
denied
the
right
kind
of
a
jury--
justice
white
--whereas
some
other
people
get
it.
justice
white
and
you
would
say
the
same
thing
even
though
there
is
no
claim
that
the
jury
was
not
impartial?
justice
white
and
the
defendant,
you
think,
has
the
right
to
press
their
claims
as
well
as
his
own,
right?
justice
white
well,
but
you...
whether
he
is
raising...
if
he
is...
even
if
he
is
raising
the
right,
claiming
the
rights
of
the
jury,
the
excluded
jurors,
he
has
to
have
an
injury
in
fact
himself,
doesn't
he?
justice
white
and
that's...
and
the
most
you
can
say
to
that
is
that
he
has
just
been...
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
jury
that
is
selected
without
discrimination.
justice
white
well,
all
you
can
say,
though,
is
the
same
thing.
his
injury
is
not
having
that
kind
of
a
jury.
justice
white
yes,
you
agree
that
all
you
can
say
is
to
repeat
yourself
that
he's
entitled
to
that
kind
of
a
jury,
and
if
he
doesn't
get
it
that's...
he's
been
injured.
justice
white
--so
the...
there
are
just
lots
of
cases
that
say
if
negroes
are
kept
out
of
the
jury
venire,
the
defendant
has
got
a
good
claim.
justice
white
to
satisfy
you,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
say
that
his
injury
in
fact
is
proved
by
having
negroes
excluded
from
his
jury,
i
would
think
you
would
say
that
the
only
negroes
who
may
be
excluded
from
the
jury
are
those
who
may
be
challenged
for
cause.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
would
think
you
would
argue
that
peremptory
challenges
certainly
can't
do
away
with
a
defendant's
right
to
have
the
kind
of
a
jury
he's
entitled
to,
can
they?
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
don't
think
they
have
to
be...
the
peremptory
challenge
of
a
negro
has
to
be
justified
by
a
cause,
by
technically
that
he
is
disqualified
for
cause?
justice
white
uh-hum.
you
just
say
that
i
don't
think
that
person
is...
i
think
that
person
is
too
well
educated
to
sit
on
a
case
like
this,
or
that
that
person
isn't
well
enough
educated
to
sit
on
a
case
like
this?
justice
white
but
you
say
that
might
be
enough
to
overcome
this
entitlement
to
a
jury
that...
from
which
blacks
aren't
excluded?
justice
white
i
suppose
there
is
a
whole
range
of
acceptable
excuses
for
a
peremptory
challenge
short
of
a
challenge
for
cause.
justice
white
well,
just
imagine
what
one
of
those,
what
they
are,
and
then
you
would
say
that
that
overcomes
this
entitlement
to
the
kind
of
a
jury
you
have
been
talking
about.
justice
white
batson
is
the
law,
i
suppose--
justice
white
--and
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
black
defendant's
standing
to
challenge
the
exclusion
of
black
jurors?
what
is
his
injury
in
fact?
justice
white
well,
how
does
that
hurt
him?
justice
white
how
does
that
hurt
him?
i'm...
we're
talking
about
injury
in
fact.
justice
white
what
is
the
in
fact
injury?
justice
white
but
even
swain
said
that
there
would
be
standing
to
challenge
it
if
they...
if
you
could
show
a
pattern
in
practice.
justice
white
i
agree,
but
i'm
still
wondering
what
your
notion
is
of
the
injury
in
fact.
justice
white
you
don't
agree
that
it's...
his
injury
in
fact
is
the
fact
he
has
been
deprived
of
a
juror...
jury
that
has
been--
justice
white
--that
has
not
been
chosen
on
nondiscriminatory
grounds?
justice
white
well,
and
the
batson
defendant,
and
the
swain
defendant.
justice
white
but
is
that...
can't
you
say
generally
then
that
the
defendant
has
been
deprived
of
a
jury
that
hasn't
been
chosen
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis?
justice
white
you
don't
think
that...
go
ahead,
sorry.
justice
white
well,
if
you
do
have
difficulty,
i
would
think
you
would
have
difficulty
with
swain,
too,
even
saying
that
you
can
challenge
a
prosecutor's
systematic
and...
practice
over
a
series
of
cases
of
excluding
all
negroes.
justice
white
so
you
think
they
ought
to
wait
until
you
know
whether
all
of
the
jurors,
or
all
of
the
blacks
are
thrown
off?
is
that
it?
justice
white
you
don't
think
it
would
be
a
prima
facie
case
if
as
soon
as
a
black
juror
is...
he
doesn't
ask
him
any
questions,
he
just
challenges
him.
