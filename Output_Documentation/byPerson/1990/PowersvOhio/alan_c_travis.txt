mr.
alan
c.
travis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
would
like
to
begin
simply
by
addressing
some
of
the
questions
raised
by
the
court.
i
would
note
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
novel
proposition.
as
mr.
lane
has
argued,
and
as
this
court
is
fully
aware,
the
use
of
peremptory...
not
peremptory,
but
the
use
of
removal
of
individuals
from
the
criminal
justice
system
based
upon
race
has
been
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
since
at
least
strauder,
110
years.
just
as
that
is
not
a
novel
proposition,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
batson
did
nothing
more
than
change
the
evidentiary
standard
which
is
required
before
an
accused
may
make
a
challenge
against
the
prosecution's
use
of
peremptories.
in
this
instance
i
think
it
is
significant,
and
this
court
has
found
it
significant,
that
much
of
the
argument
presented
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
i
think
sounds
of
a
sixth
amendment
challenge.
in
this
instance
we
have
a
significantly
different
basis
for
the
objections
by
the
defendant,
if
they
are
coming
out
of
the
sixth
versus
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
issue
which
has
been
discussed
with
mr.
lane,
the
necessity
of
a
injury
in
fact
to
the
defendant,
historically,
and
certainly
nothing
since
swain
has
changed
this,
historically
this
court
has
consistently
and
continually
stated
in
equal
protection
cases
that
in
order
to
show
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
rights
of
the
accused
he
must
show
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
distinct
class,
and
that
members
of
his
class
have
been
excluded
from
the
jury
service.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
would
say
simply
to
the
court
that
if
the
statutory
basis
were
brought,
as
the
middle
three
opinions
of
that
case
suggested,
that
might
be
a
basis
for
review
or
handling
of
this
matter.
but
it
was
not
brought
in
this
case,
nor
was
a
due
process
clause
claim
brought.
mr.
justice
marshall's
lead
opinion
suggests
that
the
issue
involved
due
process
and
equal
protection.
but
as
i
read
the
opinion
and
as
i
believe
the
dissent
points
out,
it
was
resolved
as
far
as
the
lead
opinion
goes
on
due
process
grounds,
and
for
the
center
three
opinions,
written
by
justice
white,
on
statutory
grounds.
i
think
that
is
significantly
different.
certainly
it
is
not
what
was
brought
by
this
petitioner.
just
as
in
holland,
a
petitioner
brought
a
sixth
amendment
claim,
feeling
he
was
foreclosed
under
fourteenth
amendment
grounds,
and
this
court
found
that
while
he
had
standing,
he
had
no
remedy.
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
kennedy
suggested
the
contrary
would
be
true
under
fourteenth
amendment
grounds.
i
think
if
it
came
up
under
the
criminal
prosecution
of
243,
perhaps
if
it
came
up
under
due
process
grounds,
there
might
be
a
remedy.
but
it
did
not,
and
we
are
taking
the
position
that
under
the
traditional
view
that
this
court
has
had
for
equal
protection
cases,
there
is
no
injury
in
fact
to
this
defendant.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
certainly.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that...
and
batson
relied
so
heavily
on
casteneda
against
partida,
that
the
injury
is
that
members
of
his
race,
his
cognizable
group,
have
been
excluded.
and
that
is
the
injury
in
fact.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i'm
sorry?
mr.
alan
c.
travis
the
petitioner?
mr.
alan
c.
travis
well,
of
course
the
court
has
changed
its
position
since
swain,
where
there
was
discussion
of
the
fact
that
the
peremptory
challenge
was
validly
used
for
certain
purposes,
including--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--a
pattern
in
practice,
but
to
my
knowledge
the
court
has
never
suggested
that
pattern
in
practice
would
have
other
than
a
correlation
between
the
defendant
and
the
removed
juror.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
well,
it's...
it
is
simply
that,
and
perhaps
i'm
in
mr.
lane's
position
on
the
other
side
of
the
court's
question.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
this
defendant?
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
am
sorry.
are
we
talking
about
this
defendant
petitioner?
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no,
i
don't.
i
believe
that
the
injury
in
fact
is
that
the
defendant
has
been
deprived
of
members
of
his
own
race
on
the
jury.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
but
once
again,
i
think
that
that
sounds
more
of
a
sixth
amendment
fair
cross-section
claim,
which
this
court
has
rejected,
than
it
does
a
true
equal
protection
claim.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no,
i
would
say
not.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
quite
simply,
we
take
the
position
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
grant
standing
to
this
particular
defendant,
but
even
if
it
were
to,
even
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
those
cases,
that
historic
line
of
cases
which
has
seemingly
required
a
correlation
between
the
defendant
and
the
excluded
juror,
even
if
that
series
of
cases
were
not
what
it
appears
to
be
and
what
it
has
appeared
to
be
to
so
many
lower
courts,
so
many
members...
or
so
many
members
of
the
circuit
courts,
then
i
suggest,
as
justice
kennedy
raised
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
holland,
that
in
this
case
on
this
record
it
is
not...
we
don't
have
a
sufficient
record
in
which
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
advanced
at
all
by
the
defendant.
what
the
court
indicated,
and
what
justice
kennedy,
i
should
say,
indicated
in
his
concurring
opinion
is
that
in
batson,
and
i
think
this
is
true
from
a
reading
of
the
case,
there
is
an
inference
of
racial
discrimination
when
there
is
a
showing
that
members
of
the
defendant's
race
have
been
removed
from
the
jury.
at
some
point
we
reach
the
point
where
you
can
draw
an
inference
of
racial
discrimination.
that
inference
is
not
present
when
you
do
not
have
a
correlation
between
the
excused
juror
and
the
class...
and
the
defendant's
class.
if
that
correlation
is
not
present,
and
if,
as
this
court
has
continually
said,
it
is
the
burden
of
the
defendant
in
this
case,
the
movant,
to
establish
from
the
record
a
prima
facie
case,
then
we
suggest
that
the
record
is
insufficient
in
this
case,
as
we
did
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
to
determine
that
there
was
even
a
prima
facie
case
made.
for
example,
if
we
were
to
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
that
the
venue
of
this
case
was
in
a
or
were
in
a
jurisdiction
in
which
the
members
of
the
black
race
were
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
population,
the
mere
fact
that
7
of
10
peremptory
challenges,
and
i
am
now
referring
to
this
record,
were
used
to
excuse
citizens
who
happen
to
be
black
would
not
have
any
meaning.
it
would
be
meaningless
without
a
review
and
a
correlation
between
the
excusing
of
those
jurors
and
the
pool
from
which
they
came.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
well,
justice
stevens,
that's
an
alternative,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
it
is
the
movant's,
the
defendant's
burden
to
establish
a
record
to
prevail
on
appeal.
at
the
time
i
think
it
was
clear
that
the
court
read
the
language
in
batson,
casteneda,
and
so
forth
as
requiring
correlation
between
race.
but
nonetheless,
it
is
our
position
and
we
would
urge
to
the
court
that
it's
the
defendant's
burden
to
establish
a
record
to
support
a
prima
facie
showing.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
and
if
it
has
not
been
done,
if
he
has
failed
to
establish
that
prima
facie
case,
then
there
is
no
basis
to
reverse.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
if
that's
not
inconsistent.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
think
quite
clearly
they
would.
they
would
apply
their
equal
protection
rights.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
don't
believe
so.
if
we
were
to
say,
as
i
think
the
defendant
is
suggesting
in
this
case,
petitioner
is
suggesting
that
because
he
is
a
defendant
he
is
in
the
best
position
to
raise
the
rights
of
others,
because
he
is
opposed
to
the
state
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
is
the
opposite
party.
if
that
were
the
case,
this
court's
teachings
on
standing
would
have...
would
be
totally
cut
adrift.
i
realize
it
is
not
a
trial
issue,
but
i
am
thinking
of
salvuche,
for
example.
there
is
a
defendant
who
with
his,
if
not
co-defendant,
compatriot
is
caught
basically
connected
with
drugs
that
are
in
someone
else's
possession,
and
of
course
this
court
said
quite
clearly
no
standing
to
object
to
the
violation
of
that
person's
fourth
amendment
rights.
i
simply
would
argue
to
the
court
that
merely
because
one
is
a
defendant
doesn't...
should
not
grant
one
standing
to
object
and
raise
the
right
violations
of
everyone
involved.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
am
sorry.
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
justice
stevens--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--if
there
is
a
sufficient
correlation,
and
i
recognize
that
that's
petitioner's
argument.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
think
that's...
i
may
be
giving
a
fairly
weak
response
to
you,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
is
true
in
any
case
where
the
defendant
objects.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
people
object,
and
i
don't
mean
this
facetiously,
to
virtually
anything
that
the
opposing
party
wants
to
do.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
that's
true.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
which
brings
me
back
to,
i
believe,
the
argument
made
earlier
that
i
think
that
sounds
more
of
a
sixth
amendment
fair
cross-section
analysis.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
on
the
merits,
yes.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
a
what,
your
honor?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
yes.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no,
i
didn't
hear
the
next
word.
the
next
word
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
charged.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
that
is
the
position
of
one
of
the
circuits
that
we
cited
below,
an
en
banc
position--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--we
take
that
position,
difficult
as
it
is.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
if
i
may,
if
i...
and
perhaps
i
misspoke
myself
or
spoke
too
rapidly,
i
think
when
you
have
a
correlation
with
co-defendants
you
may
have
a
very
different
position.
excuse
me,
i
think
i
did
misspoke...
misspeak
myself.
i
think
you
could
have
a
situation
where
if
you
have
co-defendants,
you
might,
as
some
of
the
dissenters
in
that
lower
court
decision
suggested,
have
the
standing.
it
is
not
an
easy
position,
i
recognize,
but
that
is
the,
that
was
the
indication
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
have...
your
honor,
i
have
great
difficulty
with
this
entire
series
of
cases
in
dealing
with
the
difficult
problem
of
racial
discrimination,
but
at
the
same
time
recognizing
that
merely
because
the
defendant
accuses
one
of
being
racially
discriminatory
in
a
trial,
that
the
defendant
has
suddenly
reached
a
prima
facie
case.
for
example,
in
this
case,
whether
he
misunderstood
batson
or
not,
the
very
first
peremptory
challenge
was
challenged,
if
you
will,
by
the
defendant,
the
petitioner,
stating
that
you
simply
cannot
peremptorily
challenge
a
member
of
a
minority
without
giving
an
explanation.
that
was
the
attack
made.
that's
the
difficulty
i
think
all
of
us
have
had
with
dealing
with
batson.
i
note
that
the
court
has
today
accepted
hernandez
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
removal
of
latinos
in
a
case
involving
an
interpreter,
whether
they
would
follow
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
court...
the
court
interpreter
would
be
a
valid
reason
to
object,
and
it
would
be
a
nonracial
reason.
it
has
been
a
very
difficult
time,
i
think,
for
the
lower
courts.
i
think
this
court
will
be
giving
further
guidance,
but
yes,
i
have
difficulty
with
that.
if
that
answers
your
question.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no,
i
would,
no,
i
don't
have...
i'm
saying
that
i
think
courts
have
had
difficulty
in
knowing
what
a
prima
facie
case
is
in
the
context
of
batson.
some
certainly
have
said
if
there
is
a
strike
and
the
jury
pool
is
of
minimal
number
of
afro-americans,
if
there's
a
minimal
number
in
the
jury
pool,
then
that
might
be
a
prima
facie
case.
indeed
it
has
been
held
a
prima
facie
case.
that's
why
i
say
that
in
this
case
we
don't
have
a
sufficient
record
for
this
court
to
determine
that
issue.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
case,
your
honor.
i
would
not
argue
that.
i
think
that
at
some
point,
and
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
you
examine
the
totality
of
circumstances.
i
think
i
would
concede
quite
clearly
that
if
you
look
at
things
such
as
the
prosecutors'
or,
in
our
position,
defendants',
use
of
the
peremptory,
immediately,
for
example,
without
any
particular
inquiry
of
the
juror,
the
type
of
the
questioning
that
is
done,
so
forth
and
so
on.
i
think
it
is
a
totality
of
circumstances,
but
i
also
argue
strenuously
to
the
court
that
in
this
case
it
is
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
make
that
record,
and
he
failed
to
do
so.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
think
perhaps
that
would
be
the...
something
that
if
i
were
sitting
as
trial
judge
i
would,
i
would
perhaps
ask.
yes.
i
think
that
very
well
could
be.
but
as
i
say,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
determining
whether
such
prima
facie
case
has
been
made.
we
would
argue
that
in
this
case
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
sixth
amendment
fair
cross-section
analysis
and
the
equal
protection
analysis.
we
have
taken
the
position,
as
we
indicate,
that
in
this
case
historically
the
court
has
always
required
a
correlation
which
is
not
present.
but
even
if
this
court
were
to
determine,
as
was
perhaps
suggested
in
some
of
the
dissent
and
concurring
opinions
in
holland,
that
that
correlation
is
not
necessary,
i
would
also
argue
to
this
court
very
strenuously
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
defendant
to
make
his
record,
and
it
was
not
done
in
this
case.
on
that
basis,
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
would
conclude
my
argument.
