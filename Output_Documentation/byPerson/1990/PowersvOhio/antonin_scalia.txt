justice
scalia
on
that
basis
anybody
would
have
the
right
to
challenge
it
then,
he
wouldn't
even
have
to
be
the
defendant.
i
guess
everybody
has
standing
on
that
theory,
right?
justice
scalia
i
mean
any
citizen.
justice
scalia
you
think
a
member
of
the
public
at
large,
not
a
juror
who
has
been
excluded,
but
a
member
of
the
public
at
large
would
have
standing
to
challenge
this?
justice
scalia
all
right.
i
think
you...
the
first
ground
that
you
mentioned,
if
it
is
a
ground
for
giving
standing
to
your
client,
is
also
a
ground
for
giving
standing
to
everybody.
and
you
acknowledge
that.
you
say
everybody
would
have
standing.
they
might
not
sue,
but
they
would
have
standing.
justice
scalia
okay,
so
you
don't
consider
the
deprivation
of
that
interest
in
having...
the
whole
society's
interest
in
having
regular
procedures.
you
don't
consider
that
to
be
injury
in
fact?
justice
scalia
what
are
the
second
and
third
interests
you
were
going
to
mention,
which
i
presume
one
of
which
does
contain
the
injury
in
fact?
justice
scalia
mr.
lane,
why
do
you
say
he
is
being
treated
differently
from
a
similarly
situated
black
defendant?
i
mean,
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
similarly
situated.
justice
scalia
yes,
but...
and
the
black
defendant
can
challenge
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
strike
all
blacks
from
the
jury,
and
the
white
defendant
presumably
can
challenge
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
strike
all
whites
from
the
jury.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
very
even
handed.
why
is
that
not
equal
somehow?
justice
scalia
to
challenge
white
defendants?
justice
scalia
no,
i
am
saying
why
is
it
a
denial
of
equal...
of
equal
protection
if
the
black
defendant
can
challenge
the
prosecutor's
intentional
striking
of
all
black
jury
persons,
and
the
white
defendant
can
challenge
the
prosecutor's
intentionally
striking
white
ones?
isn't
that
even
handed?
justice
scalia
well,
neither
does
the
black
have
the
opportunity
to
object
to
the
striking
of
white
jurors.
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
they
should,
but
not
because
of
equal
protection.
you've
got
to
give
me
some
other
reason.
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
even-handedness
goes,
it
is
quite
even
handed.
justice
scalia
your
opponent
asked
us
to
decide
whether
the...
whether
it
is
similarly
unlawful
for
the
defense
to
strike
on
the
basis
of
race.
i'm
not
sure
we
have
to
decide
that,
in
fact,
i
can't
imagine
why
we
do.
but
in
deciding
how
to
resolve
this
case,
certainly
we
must
have
that
prospect
before
us,
right?
justice
scalia
it
is
possible
that...
so
it
is
really
quite
possible
to
have
all
defendants
precluded
from
striking
people
of
the
opposite
race,
or
the
same
race,
or
women,
or
men,
or
what
other
categories?
a
criminal
defendant
who
wanted
to
strike
all,
i
don't
know,
fundamentalists,
or
whatever
he
thought
might
give
him
an
edge
in
the
decision.
that
would
be
bad
if
we
had
to
extend
that.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
how...
well,
how
we
come
out
on
this
case
plays
out
quite
differently
depending
on
how
far
we
are
prepared
to
go
in
extending
the
same
right
to
the
defense,
isn't
it?
or
the
same
obligation
to
the
defense.
justice
scalia
that's
because
he
would...
there
he
had
an
injury,
and
the
injury
was
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
an
impartial
jury,
or
of
the
opportunity
to
have
an
impartial
jury
that
was
granted
by
the
sixth
amendment.
that
is
an
injury.
justice
scalia
well,
i
understand
that,
but
this
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
claim
you
are
pressing
here.
it's--
justice
scalia
but
let's
assume
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
says,
you
know,
all
jury
have
to
arrive
at
the
court
house
at
9:00,
and
the
jury
doesn't...
the
jury
in
this
particular
case
doesn't
arrive
at
9:00,
and
you
move
for
dismissal
of
the
case
against
your
client
because
he's
entitled
to
a
jury
that
arrives
at
the
court
house
at
9:00.
would
you
think
that
that
motion
should
be
granted?
justice
scalia
wouldn't
you
insist--
justice
scalia
--well,
wouldn't
the
judge
insist
how
did
the
jury
not
getting
there
at
9:00
hurt
your
client?
justice
scalia
well,
i
agree
it's
nastier,
but
how
does
it
hurt
your
client?
i
mean,
that's
the
point.
it
isn't
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
or
nasty.
we
all
agree
it's
terrible.
but
how
did
it
hurt
your
client?
justice
scalia
in
this
case
it
may
well
have
been
bad
to
discriminate,
but
if
that
discrimination
didn't
hurt
your
client
in
anyway,
how...
how
does
he
have
standing?
justice
scalia
it's
the
same
thing
with
the
jury
arriving
at
9:00.
they
broke
the
law.
but
why
does
it
hurt
your
client?
