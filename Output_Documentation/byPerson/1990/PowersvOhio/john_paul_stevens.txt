justice
stevens
may
i
just
go
back
a
second?
in
the
equal
protection
claim,
is
it
clear
to
you
that
the
defendant
is
a
member
of
the
class
that
is
being
discriminated
against?
i
thought
you
defined
the
class
as
black
citizens
who
want
to
serve
as
jurors.
justice
stevens
the
defendant
isn't
a
member
of
that
class.
justice
stevens
so
he
has
third
party
standing
whether
he
is
black
or
white,
and
whether
the...
whether
the
challengers
are
black
jurors
or
white
jurors.
justice
stevens
mr.
travis,
i
am
curious
to
know
how
far
your
argument
takes.
assume
a
case
in
which
the
final
jury
that
is
selected
is
proportional
to
the
community,
so
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
claim.
but
a
white
defendant
finds
out
that
the
prosecutor
has
deliberately,
during
the
entire
prior
6
months
including
the
selection
of
his
own
jury,
followed
a
deliberate
policy
of
taking
as
few
blacks
as
he
could
get
away
with.
they
had
marked
them
separately
or
they
coded
them
or
something.
but
he
deliberately
tried
to
keep
the
number
of
blacks
who
get
into
the
venires
down.
would
the
white
defendant
have
any
equal
protection
basis
for
challenging
that
practice?
justice
stevens
you'd
say
not.
yeah.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
it
correct
that
in
this
case
that
determination
was
just
not
made
at
all,
because
the
holding
was
there
was
no
standing?
you
may
be
dead
right,
but
isn't
it
still
correct
for
us
to
send
it
back
and
let
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
make
that?
justice
stevens
that's
right.
justice
stevens
you're
saying
if
there
is
no
prima
facie
case
we
should
not
reach
the
standing
issue,
which
would
normally
be
the
anterior
issue?
justice
stevens
yeah.
let's
assume
the
defendant
challenges
the
elimination
of
a
particular
juror,
or
of
all
the
black
jurors,
and
the
court
asks
the...
asks
the
lawyer
what
his
reasons
are
and
determines
that
they
really
are
racial
reasons,
that
he
really
did...
throwing
the
negroes
off
because
they
are
negroes.
now,
would
the...
would
the
negroes
who
have
been
excluded
have
a
case
against
him?
justice
stevens
uh-hum.
and
you
don't
think
that
the
white
defendant
has
standing
to
press
their
rights?
justice
stevens
well,
but
you
don't
take
the
position...
i
want
to
be
sure.
you
don't
take
the
position
that
an
equal
protection
challenge
must
always
be
made
by
a
member
of
the
disfavored
class?
you
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
class
discriminated
against?
you
don't
make
that
claim,
do
you?
justice
stevens
well,
take
craig
against
boren,
for
example,
which
was
a
case
involving
discrimination
against
females,
as
i
remember.
the
bartender,
the
owner
of
the
bar
was
able
to
raise
the--
justice
stevens
--if
there
is
an
independent
injury
other
than
the
discrimination
that
justifies.
and
why
isn't
that
true
here,
when
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
object
to
the
selection
of
the
jury
panel?
he
just
thinks
if
there
had
been
a
different
panel
he
might
have
had
a
better
chance
of
acquittal.
why
doesn't
he
have
standing?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
you
have
standing
to
make
all
sorts
of
objections--
justice
stevens
--and
one
of
them
is
that
you
don't
like
that
jury
panel
because
it
is
unconstitutionally...
it
was
selected
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
justice
stevens
well,
but
that's
on
the
merits,
it
is,
yeah.
