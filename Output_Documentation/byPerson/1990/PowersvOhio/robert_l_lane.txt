mr.
robert
l.
lane
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1986
this
court
rendered
its
decision
in
the
case
of
batson
v.
kentucky,
a
case
involving
a
black
defendant
who
objected
to
the
state's
use
of
peremptory
challenges
to
exclude
blacks
from
his
jury.
batson
reaffirmed
the
principle
that
the
equal
protection
clause
prohibits
the
removal
of
black
prospective
jurors
on
the
basis
of
their
race.
the
issue
in
today's
case
is
whether
a
white
defendant
has
standing
under
batson
to
object
to
the
state's
use
of
peremptory
challenges
to
exclude
blacks
from
his
jury.
approximately
1
year
after
this
court's
decision
in
batson,
larry
joe
powers
stood
trial
on
two
counts
of
aggravated
murder
with
death
penalty
specifications,
and
one
count
of
attempted
aggravated
murder.
during
the
jury
selection
process
the
state
used
10
peremptory
challenges.
seven
of
those
challenges
were
used
to
exclude
blacks
from
the
jury.
the
defense
objected
to
these
peremptory
challenges
and
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
what
the
state
was
trying
to
do
was
to
remove
all
the
blacks
from
the
jury.
neither
the
state
nor
the
court
refuted
defense
counsel's
statements.
the
court
overruled
the
objections,
and
the
court
failed
to
compel
the
state
to
put
its
reasons
on
the
record,
even
though
defense
counsel
had
requested
such
a
requirement.
mr.
powers
was
ultimately
found
guilty,
and
he
was
sentenced
to
53
years
to
life
in
the
ohio
penal
system,
where
he
is
today.
mr.
powers
appealed
his
conviction
to
the
franklin
county,
ohio,
court
of
appeals.
in
that
appeal
he
argued
that
both
his
rights
and
the
rights
of
those
excluded
jurors
had
been
denied
under
this
court's
decision
in
batson
by
the
state's
actions
and
by
the
court's
actions.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
claim
and
affirmed
mr.
powers'
conviction,
finding
that
mr.
powers
could
not
make
a
batson
claim
because
he
was
not
the
same
race
as
those
jurors.
mr.
powers
then
raised
the
same
issue
in
the
ohio
supreme
court.
that
court
denied
him
discretionary
review,
finding
that
no
substantial
constitutional
question
existed
in
this
case.
for
well
over
100
years
this
court
has
steadfastly
prohibited
racial
discrimination
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
the
batson
decision
stands
on
three
important
values,
values
that
are
important
to
all
criminal
defendants
regardless
of
their
race.
among
these
values
is
the...
that
the
court
has
recognized,
is
the
value
that
a
democratic
society
cannot
survive
unless
the
people
in
that
society
have
the
faith
and
the
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
racial
discrimination
erodes
that
faith
and
confidence.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
your
honor,
the--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--there
are
real
impediments
to
someone
else
coming
in
and
making
that
challenge.
now,
another
citizen
could
file
an
action
under
1983,
they
could
bring
a
civil
action,
as
the
plaintiffs
did
in
carter
v.
greene
county
commissioners,
or
there
is
the
federal
statute.
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
mr.
powers'
standing
as
a
criminal
defendant.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
under
the
criminal
statute,
if
someone
was
a
witness
to
it
they
probably
could
file
a
complaint
against
the
prosecutor
or
the
guilty
party
for
a
violation
of
that
criminal
statute.
and
this
court
has
also
recognized,
as
in
the
carter
case,
that
aggrieved
parties
could
file
civil
action
before
so.
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
we're
talking
about
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
they
would
have
to
meet
the
requirements
that
this
court
has
set
down
in
singleton
v.
wulff
and
other
cases
on
standing,
showing
an
injury
in
fact,
showing
a
substantial
relationship,
and
so
forth.
they
would
have
to
show
those
standing
requirements,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
the
problem
is,
your
honor,
is
that
we're
talking
about
a
situation
that
is
not
a
problem
that
arises
before
the
trial.
it
arises
during
a
trial,
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
party
to
say
that
in
the
upcoming
trial
that
this
prosecutor
is
going
to
use
his
peremptory
challenges
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner.
sometimes,
the
lawsuit
would
have
to
precede
the
injury,
and
there
may
be
a
problem
there.
this
court
has
recognized
in
prior
decisions
that
a
criminal
defendant
is
in
the
best
position
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
community,
the
excluded
jurors,
and
himself.
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
reversal
of
conviction
is
generally
the
best
vehicle
by
way
this
racial
discrimination
can
be
prohibited
and
vindicated.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
yes,
your
honor.
the
defendant
has
suffered
an
injury
in
fact,
and
the
jurors
have
an
interest
in
seeing
that
their
rights
have
been
protected.
the
jurors
have
an
equal
protection
right
to
participate
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
where
they
are
denied
that
right,
their
equal
protection
rights
have
been
violated.
the
harm
to
the
community
is
the
same
regardless
of
the
defendant's
race.
whether
a
defendant
is
white
or
black,
if
he
is
denied
the
opportunity
to
sit
before
a
jury
that
has
been
chosen
in
the
absence
of
racial
discrimination,
the
community
is
still
going
to
see
this
as
a
very
serious
problem
with
the
criminal
justice
system.
this
court
cannot
tolerate
racial
discrimination
simply
because
the
defendant
is
not
of
the
same
race
as
the
jurors.
as
justice
kennedy
stated
in
his
opinion
in
holland
v.
illinois,
citizens
cannot
be
denied
the
duty
and
honor
of
jury
service
on
the
basis
of
race
just
because
the
defendant
is
not
of
the
same
race
as
those
jurors.
batson
is
based
on
the
need
to
preserve
public
confidence
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
that
need
is
the
same
regardless
of
the
defendant's
race.
the
need
is
the
same
regardless
of
the
juror's
race.
in
the
case
of
strauder
v.
west
virginia
this
court
recognized
that
racial
discrimination
in
the
criminal
justice
system
creates
and
further
stimulates
the
kind
of
racial
discrimination,
race
prejudice,
that
forecloses
people
from
participating
in
the
justice
system.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
your
honor,
if
the
defendant
can
make
a
prima
facie
showing
that
that
juror
has
been
excluded--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--that
would
have
to
be
decided
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
your
honor,
and
the
defendant
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
what--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--it
would
be
up
to
the
judge
at
that
point
to
decide
whether
a
prima
facie
case
has
been--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--well,
it
would
be
the
factors
of...
he
could
look
at
the
questions
that
the
prosecutor--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--this
court
recognized
that
a
court,
in
determining
that
prima
facie
case,
must
look
at
the
pattern
of
questioning,
can
look
at
the
type
of
questioning,
it
could
be
the
prosecutor's
attitude
in
a
specific
case,
it
could
be
the
issues
in
the
case.
there
are
a
lot
of
issues,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
this
court
has
recognized
that
where
the
juror
and
the
defendant
are
of
the
same
race
that
the
discrimination
may
be
more
obvious.
but
it
is
not
the
only
question
to
be
determined.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
every
defendant
should
have
standing,
your
honor,
regardless
of
the
race
of
the
defendant--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--because
there
is
clearly--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--in
order
to
have
standing
there
has
to
be
an
injury
in
fact.
there
has
to--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--to
him,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
the
injury
in
this
case
is
that
mr.
powers,
just
as
mr.
batson,
was
denied
a
jury
that
meets
fourteenth
amendment
requirements.
a
jury
stands
to
protect
a
defendant
from
the
oppressive
and
arbitrary
powers
of
the
government.
the
jury
protects
the
defendant
from...
protects
his
civil
liberties.
and
wherever
racial
discrimination
arises
in
the
selection
of
that
jury,
that
jury
does
not
meet
the
definition
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
claim.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
it's
an
equal
protection
claim,
your
honor.
every--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--in
this
situation
a
black
defendant
would
receive
better
treatment
because
he
is
granted
standing--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--he
has
been
denied
a
jury
that
has
been
chosen
in
the
absence
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
the
defendant
in
that
case,
the
black
defendant
and
the
black
juror,
he
has
been
denied
this
jury
that
protects
him,
where
this
jury
should
come
between
him
and
the
powers
of
the
government,
and
where
race
enters
into
that
selection
of
the
jury.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
powers
has
the
same
standing
as
mr.
batson.
all
criminal
defendants--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--your
honor,
the...
there
is
a
lack
of
impartiality
here
in
that
in
order
for
a
jury
to
meet
fourteenth
amendment
impartiality
standards
there
must
not
be
any
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
that
jury.
this
court--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--your
honor,
the
equal
protection
violation
that
is
most
succinct
to
mr.
powers
is
that
he
has
been
treated
differently
than
a
similarly
situated
black
defendant.
and
there
is
an
equal
protection
violation
there.
there
is
also--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--your
honor,
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
racial
discrimination
enters
into
the
jury
selection
process,
that
that
jury
does
not
meet
the
impartiality
test
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
a
criminal
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
their
similar
situation
is
that
they
are
criminal
defendants.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
under
the
decision
of
the
franklin
county,
ohio,
court
of
appeals,
the
black,
the
white
defendant
does
not
have
that
same
opportunity.
larry
powers
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
vindicate
his
rights,
the
rights
of
the
those
jurors,
and
the
rights
of--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--no,
i
am
sorry.
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
your
honor,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
defendant
does
not
have
the
opportunity
to
object
to
the
striking
of
black
defendants...
the
black
jurors.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
they
should,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
it
is
not
even
handed
when
you
draw
lines
on
racial
criteria,
your
honor.
when
you
say
a
white
defendant
can
do
something
that
a
black
defendant
cannot,
and
in
another
case
a
black
defendant
can
do
something
that
a
white
defendant
cannot,
that
is
drawing
lines
on
a
racial
criteria.
that's
the
type
of
racial
discrimination
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
to
eliminate.
and
when
a
defendant
is
made
to
stand
trial
before
a
jury
in
the
selection
of
which
there
has
been
racial
discrimination,
that
defendant,
regardless
of
his
or
her
race,
has
been
denied
equal
protection.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
your
honor,
gender
is
a
separate
question.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
your
honor,
if
this
court
has
determined
that
gender
is
a
suspect
class
for
equal
protection
analysis,
then
i
would
say
it
would
be
proper
to
do
so.
but
in
this
case,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
racial
discrimination.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
the
issue
proffered
by
the
state
in
the
second
part
of
their
brief
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
it
may
have
an
impact,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
remains
that
there
are
a
lot
of
different
issues
involved
in
trying
to
extend
the
batson
principles
to
a
defendant's
use
of
peremptory
challenges,
a
lot
of
issues
in
addition
to
racial
discrimination.
when
a
juror
has
been
excluded
from
a
criminal
defense
jury
on
the
basis
of
his
or
her
race,
that
juror
has
been
denied
their
equal
protection
rights.
they
have
been
denied
the
right
to
participate
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
absolutely,
your
honor,
because
to
bar
that
claim
to
the
defendant
would
be
to
say
that
this
court
is
going
to
condone
or
tolerate
racial
discrimination
simply
because
the
defendant
is
not
of
the
same
race
as
the
jurors.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
your
honor,
it
is
not
very
often
invoked,
and
i
believe
there
is
a
footnote
in
peters
that
indicates
that
there
have
been
very,
very
few
convictions
under
that,
and
very,
very...
very
few--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--your
honor,
that
statute
has
been
on
the
books
for
over
100
years,
and
as
this
court
has
noted,
racial
discrimination
has
continued
despite
the
existence
of
that
statute.
the
problem
with
that
statute
is
you
may
take
a
prosecutor
or
other
guilty
party
and
fine
that
person
$5,000,
but
the
community's
faith
and
confidence
in
the
system
is
still
going
to
be
harmed.
the
jurors
are
still
denied
their
equal
protection
rights,
and
the
defendant
is
still
convicted
of
criminal
offenses.
the
criminal
statute
which
you
could
impose
on
a
person
guilty
of
racial
discrimination
does
not
address
the
harm
suffered
by
all
the
parties.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
yes,
your
honor.
the
class--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--exactly.
and
there
is,
that
recognition
is
made
in
the
batson
decision
that
the
class...
the
defendant
is
not
of
the
class
of
the
jurors.
he
has
no
interest
in
sitting
on
a
jury.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
absolutely,
your
honor.
he
has
standing.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
it's
a
very
important
injury,
sir.
it's
a
very
severe
injury.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
this
court
has
recognized
that,
your
honor,
where
racial
discrimination
has
existed
in
the
selection
of--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--this
court
has
recognized
that,
your
honor,
in
vasquez
v.
hillery,
rose
v.
mitchell,
in
a
lot
of
other
cases.
this
court
has
determined
that
when
racial
discrimination
exists
in
the
selection
of
a
jury,
a
criminal
defendant's
conviction
should
be
reversed,
even
in
the
cases
where
the
racial
discrimination
occurred
at
the
grand
jury
stage
and
there
was
no
allegation
of
discrimination
in
the
petit
jury.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
the
impartiality
springs
from
the
racial
discrimination,
your
honor.
the
jury
that
is
chosen
along
racial
criteria
contravenes
the
very
idea
of
the
jury.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
that
is
true,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
claim.
it's
an
equal
protection
claim,
because
everyone,
regardless
of
their
race,
has
a
right
to
that
same
jury,
a
right
to
a
jury
that
has
been
chosen
in
the
absence
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
if
racial
discrimination
exists,
your
honor,
that
defendant
has
been
harmed.
he
has
suffered
the
injury
in
fact
that
is
required.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
i
don't
see
the
analogy
there--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--with
racial
discrimination.
this
court
has--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--it
doesn't
have
that
same
imprimatur
of
racial
discrimination
in
impart...
in
partiality.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
that
he
did
not
have
a
jury
because
the
jurors
arrived
late?
maybe
i
misunderstand
your
question,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--mr.
powers--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--the
jury
must
be
chosen
in
the
absence
of
racial
criteria.
this
court
has
set
forth
that
standard.
i
don't...
i
don't
see
the
analogy
between
a
jury
arriving
late
and
invidious
racial
discrimination.
this
court
has
held
that
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
jury
makes
that
jury
inadequate
for
fourteenth
amendment
requirements.
that
defendant
has
been
denied
the
jury
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires.
and
the
only
way
that
that
type
of
discrimination
is
going
to
be
effectively
answered
is
if
the
criminal
defendant
can
object
to
it
and
raise
it
on
appeal.
mr.
powers--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
peremptory
challenge
is
not
the
same
as
a
challenge
for
cause,
and
the
injury
in
fact--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--no,
your
honor,
they
can't.
peremptory
challenges
cannot
be
used
in
a
manner
to--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--the
prosecutor
has
to
have
nonracial
reasons.
they
don't
have
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
challenge
for
cause,
but
they
have
to
be
nonracial
reasons,
and
they
cannot
be
based
on
the
juror's
race.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
a
juror
must
be
chosen
on
his
personal
qualifications
and
characteristics--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--that
a
juror
is
not
a...
not
educated
enough?
your
honor,
some
lower
courts
have
looked
at
those
type
of
responses
and
found
them
wanting,
founding...
found
that
they
did
not
survive
a
batson
challenge.
and
that
was,
would
have
to
be
a
decision
made
by
the--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
it
does,
does
not
overcome
it,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
constitutional
requirement.
and
what
batson
says
is
if
the
prosecution
can
show
to
the
court,
can
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
the
prosecution
used
nonracial
reasons,
then
it
may
survive
a
batson
challenge.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
yes,
your
honor,
for
mutual
reasons,
reasons
related
to
the
juror's
individual
qualifications
and
characteristics.
not
related
to
race.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
the
trial
court
has
the
burden,
your
honor,
of
looking
at--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--if
the
court,
or
the
trial
court,
or
the
reviewing
court
felt
that
it
was
not--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--a
racial
reason
for
a--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--okay.
then
it
would
probably
survive
the
batson
challenge,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
well,
if
we
stipulate,
as
your
honor
said,
then
it
probably...
it
would
survive.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
i
will
use
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
l.
lane
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
this
record
is
actually
stronger
than
the
record
made
by
mr.
batson.
we
have
in
this
case
7
peremptory
challenges
out
of
10
used
to
exclude
blacks
from
this
jury.
defense
counsel,
without
refutation
by
prosecutor
or
by
the
court,
said
that
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
is
to
remove
all
blacks
from
this
jury.
second
of
all,
addressing
the
criminal
statute,
18
u.s.c.
243,
that
statute
has
its
foundation,
its
basis
in
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
statute
was
designed
to
implement
those
goals
of
the
elimination
of
racial
discrimination.
thirdly,
this
court--
mr.
robert
l.
lane
--it
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
level,
your
honor,
and
again
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
rose
v.
mitchell
that
that
is
an
ineffective
way
of
eliminating
racial
discrimination.
now,
we
did
cite
that
statute
in
our
analysis
of
peters
v.
kiff.
we
cited
it
in
the
lower
courts,
and
we
talked
about
it
here.
but
this
court
has
recognized
that
that
criminal
statute
will
not
eliminate
racial
discrimination.
that
statute
has
been
on
the
books
for
well
over
100
years,
and
as
this
court
has
recognized,
racial
discrimination
still
continues.
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
unless
every
defendant,
regardless
of
race,
is
granted
standing
to
object
to
the
prosecution's
use
of
racial
discrimination
in
selecting
that
defendant's
jury,
that
racial
discrimination
will
continue
in
this
country.
and
that
is
a
situation
that
this
court
cannot
condone
nor
tolerate.
thank
you.
