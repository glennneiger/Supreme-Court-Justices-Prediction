chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-5011,
larry
joe
powers
v.
ohio.
mr.
lane,
you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
aren't
you
confusing
impartiality
with
equal
protection
there?
i
mean,
we
have
not...
we
have
talked
about
jury
impartiality
in
some
cases
quite
independently
of
equal
protection.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
does
that
necessarily
go
to
the
impartiality
of
the
jury?
chief
justice
rehnquist
nonracial
reasons
for
what
is
the
effect
of
peremptory
strike.
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
could
be
all
over
the
lot,
i
suppose.
if
lack
of
education
was
not
found
to
be
a
proxy
for
race,
that
would
be
a
perfectly
good
basis
for
a
peremptory
challenge,
just
as
too
much
education
might
be
a
perfectly
good
basis
for
a
peremptory
challenge.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
asking
you
a
question.
if
they
were
not
found
to
be
a
proxy
for
race,
would
either
lack
of
education
or
over
education
be
an
adequate
basis
for
justifying
a
peremptory
challenge?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--we
stipulate
it
is
not
a
proxy
for
race.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
probably.
why
would
it
not
automatically
survive
it
if
it's
not
a
proxy
for
race?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
would
survive.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lane.
we
will
hear
now
from
mr.
travis.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
travis.
mr.
lane,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lane.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-5011,
powers
against
ohio
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
