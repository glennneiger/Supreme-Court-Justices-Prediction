how

the

is
white,

he
challenges
five

i

there

the

that
the

do
you

justice

i
know
that

we
have
to
be
concerned
with
the

we
write

the

of

there
is

--i'm
sure
that
is
not
often
invoked,

it
is
quite
specific
on
this
point.
justice
kennedy
but
if
there
is
a
criminal
sanction,
it
seems
to
me
that
maybe
that
would
suffice
and
we
don't
need
the
civil
cause

action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
our
decision
in
powers
versus
ohio
is
summarized
as
follows:
the
case
concerns
the
prosecution's
use
of
preemptory
challenges
in
the
jury
selection
process.
in
1986,
we
ruled
that
in
a
criminal
case,
a
prosecutor
could
not
use
the
preemptory
challenge
as
a
way
to
remove
jurors
of
the
same
race
as
the
defendant
where
race
was
the
reason
for
the
challenge.
that
case
was
batson
versus
kentucky.
today,
we
must
decide
whether
the
rule
in
batson
applies
so
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
can
object
to
the
race-based
exclusion
of
the
juror
where
the
perspective
juror
and
the
defendant
are
not
of
the
same
race.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
a
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio.
the
petitioner,
one
larry
powers,
was
convicted
in
ohio
of
murder
and
other
related
counts.
at
his
trial,
he
sought
to
object
when
the
prosecution
used
seven
different
challenges
to
remove
black
persons
from
the
jury
selection
panel.
powers
himself
is
white.
he
sought
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
challenges
were
racially
motivated.
the
trial
court
and
the
ohio
reviewing
courts
held
that
he
could
not
raise
a
batson
type
objection.
we
now
reverse.
the
individual
juror
has
a
right
not
to
be
excluded
by
a
prosecution
challenge
that
is
based
on
the
juror's
race.
the
opportunity
for
ordinary
citizens
to
participate
in
the
administration
of
justice
has
long
been
recognized
as
one
of
the
principal
justifications
for
the
jury
system.
juries
preserve
the
democratic
element
of
the
law
by
guarding
the
rights
of
the
parties
and
insuring
continued
acceptance
of
the
laws
by
all
the
people.
but
the
exception
of
voting,
for
most
citizens,
the
honor
and
privilege
of
jury
duty
is
their
most
significant
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
democratic
process.
while
an
individual
juror
does
not
have
a
right
to
sit
on
any
particular
petit
jury,
the
equal
protection
clause
prohibits
a
prosecutor
from
using
the
state's
preemptory
challenges
to
exclude
otherwise
qualified
and
unbiased
persons
from
the
jury
solely
by
reason
of
their
race.
we
do
not
believe
that
race-based
preemptory
challenges
survive
equal
protection
scrutiny
because
members
of
all
races
are
subject
to
like
treatment
which
is
to
say
that
white
jurors
are
subject
to
the
same
risk
of
discriminatory
exclusion
as
our
jurors
of
other
races.
it
is
actually
emetic
that
racial
classifications
do
not
become
legitimate
on
the
assumption
that
all
person
suffer
them
in
equal
degree.
we
further
hold
that
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
has
requisite
standing
to
challenge
the
prosecution's
racially
discriminatory
exclusion
of
jurors.
the
discrimination
causes
the
defendant
a
cognizable
injury.
the
injury
arises
not
because
the
individual
jurors
dismissed
by
the
prosecution
may
had
been
predisposed
to
favor
the
defendant.
if
that
were
true,
the
jurors
might
have
been
excluded
for
cause.
rather,
it
is
because
of
the
intrusion
of
racial
discrimination
into
the
jury
selection
process
casts
doubt
on
the
integrity
of
the
entire
trial.
the
prosecutor's
wrongful
exclusion
of
a
juror
by
a
race-based
preemptory
challenge
is
a
constitutional
violation
committed
in
open
court
at
the
outset
of
the
proceedings.
active
discrimination
by
a
prosecutor
condones
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution
within
the
very
institution
entrusted
with
its
enforcement
and
so
invites
cynicism
respecting
the
jury's
neutrality
in
its
obligation
to
adhere
to
the
law.
the
purpose
of
the
jury
system
is
to
impress
upon
the
criminal
defendant
and
the
community
as
a
whole
that
a
verdict
of
conviction
or
acquittal
is
given
in
accordance
with
the
law
by
persons
who
are
fair.
the
verdict
will
not
be
accepted
or
understood
in
these
terms
if
the
jury
is
chosen
by
unlawful
means
at
the
outset.
we,
thus,
find
that
a
criminal
defendant
may
challenge
the
exclusion
of
jurors
on
account
of
race.
to
bar
a
petitioner's
claim
because
of
his
race
differs
from
that
of
the
excluded
jurors
would
be
to
condone
the
arbitrary
exclusion
of
citizens
from
the
duty,
honor,
and
privilege
of
jury
service.
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
ohio
courts
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice.
