mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
fact
finders
found
that
they
did
not,
but
the
question
of
whether
a
person
has
black
lung
disease
in
a
case
involving
ventilatory
studies
or
blood
gas
tests,
their
types
of
cases,
is
one
in
which
the
state
of
the
medical
art...
hew's
view
in
1972
was
that
the
state
of
the
medical
art
had
simply
not
advanced
far
enough
to
be
able
to
make
the
determination
about
whether
a
person's
respiratory
or
pulmonary
impairment--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--present
fact
is
that
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
state
of
the
medical
art
has--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--well,
i...
my
response
is
that
we
don't
know,
because
the
state
of
the
medical
art
does
not
allow
you
to
know.
the
fact
finders
found
that
they
do
not.
that's
so.
but
hew
believed
that
such
findings
of
fact
were
inherently
inaccurate,
and
that's
why
i
can't
answer
that
one
yes
or
no.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
we
believe
that
that's
so,
too.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
the--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--well,
there
were
two
miners--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--what
i
believe
you
are
referring
to,
there
were
two
miners.
mr.
dayton
established
the
presumption
using
ventilatory
study
evidence.
that
was
a--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--taylor
relied
on
the
blood
gas
test.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the...
but
at
the
time
it
would
have
been
futile
for
hew
to
have
included
blood
gas
tests--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--well,
as
we
say
in
mr.
taylor's
brief,
it
turns
on
the
specific
word
"criteria"
in
the
statute,
and
the
distinction
between
substantive
criteria
on
the
one
hand
and
forms
of
evidence
on
the
other.
and
since
blood
gas
studies
show
the
same
fact
element,
the
presence
of
a
respiratory
or
pulmonary
impairment,
the
same
fact
element
that
ventilatory
studies
show,
we
believe
that
dol
later,
when
it
no
longer
was
futile
to
establish
standards
for
blood
gas
studies,
had
to
apply
the
same
criteria
with
respect
to
blood
gas
study
cases
as
it
did
with
respect
to
ventilatory
study
cases.
that's
the
nature
of
our
argument
in
the--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--these
consolidated
cases
turn
on
a
face
of
the
statute
question
and
on
a
face
of
the
regulation
question.
the
face
of
the
statute
question
is
simple,
because
this
court's
decision
in
sebben
has
already
answered
it.
in
the
face
of
the
regulation
question
is
a
straight...
has
a
straightforward
resolution
too,
because
there
is
only
one
permissible
interpretation
of
these
interim
regulations
that
are
pertinent
to
the
case.
the
regulations
are
not
the
model
of
clarity,
but
they're
clear
enough
to
be
able
to
ascertain
that
there's
simply
no
permissible
interpretation
that
would
allow
the
extra
rebuttal
tests
of
the
dol
interim
regulation
to
be
read
into
them.
now,
first
with
respect
to
the
statutory
question.
the
centerpiece
of
the
1978
amendments
to
the
black
lung
benefits
act
was
section
402(f)(2).
section
402(f)(2)
prohibited
the
secretary
of
labor
from
adjudicating
claims
using
criteria
that
were
more
restrictive
to
claimants
than
the
criteria
in
effect
or
applicable
on
june
30th,
1973.
the
question
in
this
case
would
have
been
which
criteria
were
applicable
on
june
30th,
1973,
except
that
the,
this
court's
decision
in
sebben
has
already
answered
that
question.
sebben
answered
it
holding
that
the
criteria
applicable
on
june
30,
1973,
include
the
criteria
of
the
hew
interim
provision.
and
because
the
criteria
of
the
hew
interim
provision
are
the
most
favorable
criteria
to
claimants,
section
402(f)(2)
of
the
act
prohibited
the
secretary
of
labor
from
using...
from
adjudicating
claims
using
the
criteria
that
are
more
restrictive
than
the
criteria
of
the
hew
interim
provision.
so
the
hew
interim
provision
is
the
touchstone
of
section
402(f)(2)
of
the
act.
now
the
regulatory
question.
the
regulatory
question
is
whether
any
rebuttal
criteria
of
the
dol
interim
regulation
make
that
regulation
more
restrictive
to
claimants
than
the
hew
interim
provision.
now
this
question
has
a
straightforward
resolution,
just
as
the
statutory
question
does.
the
hew
interim
provision
has
two...
has
only
two
rebuttal
tests,
whereas
the
dol
interim
regulation
has
four
rebuttal
tests.
the
dol
regulation
has
the
same
two
rebuttal
tests
as
the
hew
provision,
and
two
additional
ones
as
well.
the
two
additional
rebuttal
tests
of
the
dol
regulation
pertain
to
disability
causation
and
to
the
presence
of
pneumoconiosis.
each
of
the
dol
interim
regulation's
two
extra
rebuttal
tests
makes
it
easier
for
opponents
to
rebut
the
hew...
the
dol
interim
regulation
than
to
rebut
the
hew
interim
regulation.
so
on
its
face,
the
dol
interim
regulation
is
more
restrictive
to
claimants
than
the
hew
interim
provision,
in
violation
of
section
402(f)(2).
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
they
do.
they
contend
that
this
regulation
is
confusing,
can
be
read
to
include
provisions
like
the
two
extra
rebuttal
tests
of
the
dol
interim
regulation,
and
they
offer
varying
readings
of
the
hew
interim
provision
that
contradict
each
other.
but
none
of
the
readings
that
they
offer
is
a
permissible
interpretation
of
the
hew
interim
provision.
when
the
hew
interim
provision
is
carefully
scrutinized
in
light
of
hew's
own
interpretation
of
it
in
its
coal
miners
benefits
manual,
no
permissible
interpretation
of
it
can
include
any
provisions
like
the
two
extra
rebuttal
tests
of
the
dol
interim
regulation.
so
the
struggle
in
the
questioning
when
my
opponents
were
here
talking
to
you
was
about
what
did
hew,
what
did
the
social
security
administration
really
do
in
these
cases.
what
we
know,
and
something
that
they
did
not
mention,
what
we
know
is
that
they
issued
a...
the
coal
miners
benefits
manual,
they
issued
it
3
weeks
after
the
hew
interim
provision
was
promulgated.
and
that
coal
miners
benefits
manual
is
their
contemporaneous
interpretation...
is
ssa's
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
its
interim
provision.
and
it
makes
clear
beyond
peradventure
that
with
respect
to
that
with
respect
to
these
extra
rebuttal
tests
that
labor
later
added,
hew
simply
did
not
allow
inquiries
into
anything
like
those
two
extra
rebuttal
tests.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
yes,
we...
it
is
valid.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
it
was
valid
under--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--right.
that's
the
superficial--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--right.
that's
the...
that's
the
superficially
appealing
point
that
our
opponents
try
to--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--try
to
press
in
their
briefs.
they
try
to
press
the
superficial
point
in
their
briefs.
the
legislative
rule-making
authority
that
congress
had
delegated
hew
was
well
broad
enough,
certainly
broad
enough
to
allow
ssa
to
decide
to
conclusively
presume
facts.
now,
when
we
say
conclusively
presume,
it's
different
than
irrebuttability.
this
regulation
was
rebuttable.
it
was
rebuttable
by
certain
facts
that
were
not
directly
related...
directly
related
to
disability
causation
or
the
presence
of
pneumoconiosis.
but
ssa
believed
that
it
was
permissible
to
indirectly
prove
these
facts,
based
on
a
miner
who
has
pneumoconiosis
and
who
is
totally
disabled
would
prove
these
facts
by
a
conclusive
presumption
based
on...
based
on
these
facts.
now
the
reason
that
ssa
decided
to
do
that
was
because
it
had
come
to
the
realization
or
the
belief,
based
on
study...
hew's
officials
and
medical
officers
believed
that
the
state
of
the
medical
art
simply
was
not
advanced
far
enough
at
the
time
to
be
able
to
allow
fact
finders
and
physicians
to
make
reasoned
determinations
concerning
the
element
of
disability
causation.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
well,
more
than
that.
congress
decided
in
section
402(f)(2)
of
the
act
to
incorporate
the
hew
interim
provision.
it
specifically
said
the
secretary
of
labor
cannot
apply
criteria
more
restrictive
than
the
criteria
in
effect
on
june
30,
1973,
and
those
criteria
included
the
hew
interim
provision,
the
most
liberal,
the
most
favorable
regulations
to
claimants
at
the
time.
that
was
the
touchstone
in
section
402(f)(2).
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
no,
i...
the...
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
it's
permissible
for
two
different
agencies
to
come
to
different
conclusions
about
the
state
of
the
medical
art.
there
were
physicians
that
testified
on
both
sides
of
the
question.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
that
may
be
so,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
the
state
of
the
medical
art
has
advanced
far
enough
even
now.
the...
that
was--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--well,
i...
we
believe
that
we
don't
need
to
resort
to
the
legislative
history
because
what
ssa's
view
was...
is
why
they
left
the
two
rebuttal
tests
out
of
the,
of
its
own
interim
provision.
and
congress
took
that
at
face
value
in
1972.
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
that
the...
that
dol
could
change
it,
the
regulation,
based
on
even
its
different
view,
if
it
had
one,
that
the
state
of
the
medical
art
had
been
updated.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
pneumoconiosis.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
no,
there
are
obviously
cases
in
which
the...
it
would
have
been
possible
to
conclude
that.
but
we
have--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--because
hew
was
an
administrative
agency
and
had
a
line-drawing
problem,
the
typical
kind
of
line-drawing
problem
in
the
law.
they
had
to
decide
whether
to
be
underinclusive
or
to
be
overinclusive.
and
they
made
the
decision
that--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--because
it...
hew's
view
was
that
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
prove.
that
necessarily
meant...
that
didn't...
that
wasn't--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--no,
because
physicians
didn't
necessarily
share
that
view.
employers
could
go
out
and
hire
physicians
who
believed
that
they
could
give
an
opinion,
an
opinion
that
would
defeat
the
claim.
nevertheless,
hew's
view
was
such
opinions
are
inaccurate,
inherently
inaccurate.
hew,
as
an
administrative
agency,
had
the
authority
to
make
the
decision,
as
between
competing
views
in
the
medical
community,
as
to
which
one
was
right.
and
they
concluded
that
it
was
virtually
impossible.
now
that
wasn't...
certainly
some
physicians
disagreed
with
that,
and
employers
could
get
them
to
write
opinions
that
would
beat
claims.
hew
took
that
away
from
the
physicians
and
from
the
administrative
law
judges.
that's
why
hew
had
a
line-drawing
problem.
by
drawing
the
line
where
it
did,
it
avoided
being
underinclusive.
it
ensured
that
all
deserving
claimants
would
get
benefits.
it
also
meant
that
some
undeserving
claimants
might
get
benefits
as
well,
like
the
miner
in
the
car
accident
hypothetical.
but
we...
they
have
never
shown
anything
to
suggest
that
that
miner...
that
there
is
such
a
miner
who
ever
filed
a
claim
for
benefits.
they
have
never
pulled
anything
out
of
a
file,
an
unpublished,
published
decision,
at
any
administrative
or
judicial
level
showing
that
that
miner
even
existed.
so
we
may
have
a...
they
raise
that
as
a
specter,
but
it
may
be
a
nonexistent
downside
of
the
traditional
rule-making,
line-drawing
problem.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
under
ss--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--our
opponents
say
that
ssa
would
not
have
approved
benefits
in
these
claims.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
they
would
have.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
they
certainly
would
have
recovered
under
the
hew
interim
provision.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
right,
because
the
hew
interim
provision
did
not
address
those
inquiries.
but
again--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--excuse
me,
i--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--hew's
report
to
the
gao
was
that
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
make
these
determinations.
that's
why
it
didn't
include
the
disability
causation
in
the--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--that
is
incorrect.
there...
the...
any
representation
that
may
have
been
made
to
you
that
the
car
accident
hypothetical
would
have
lost
is
incorrect.
the
car
accident
hypothetical
would
have
won,
and
we
realize
that
such
a
miner
would
not
have
been
a
deserving
miner,
but
he
would
have
won.
the...
it's
a
downside
of
the
line-drawing
problem.
it
simply
was
not
feasible
to
draw
a
line
that
would
exclude
everything.
it's
like
the
morning
v.
family
publications
case.
you
can't...
it's
very
difficult
for
legislatures
and
agencies
which
legislatively
rule
make
to
draw
precise
lines.
but
again,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
the
government
and
the
coal
industries
have
access
to
all
the
files
in
all
the
cases,
and
they
haven't
shown
you
evidence
of
even
one
case
in
which
a
claim
was
even
filed
that
had...
that
was
based
on
an
accident
of
any
kind,
much
less
a
car
accident
claim.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
i
don't...
i
have
never
seen
any
reference.
i
certainly
don't
remember
any
reference
of
a
car
accident
hypothetical
in
any
report
to
the
gao.
the
first
time
we
have
heard
of
the
car
accident
hypothetical
is
in
the
briefs
of
our
opponents.
it's
a
specter
that
they
have
raised
that
may
well
be
nonexistent.
they
haven't
backed
it
up
with
even
any
indication
that
there
was
ever
such
a
claim
filed.
besides
deciding
that
its
interim
provision
would
conclusively
presume
disability
causation,
hew
also
decided
that
it
would
conclusively
presume
the
presence
of
pneumoconiosis
in
ventilatory
study
cases.
as
we--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--no,
it
is
not.
it's
a
term--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--we
coined
it
in
our
briefs--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--and
it's
fraught
with
problems.
but
the
notion--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--the
regulation
does
conclusively
presume
it
in
the
sense
that
we
use
it--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--because
it
says
on
its
face
hew
recognized
the
act's
requirement
that
miners
be
totally
disabled
due
to
pneumoconiosis.
and
it...
and
the
regulation,
the
hew
regulation
says
that
miners
who
invoke
the
presumption
get
a
presumption
that
they
are
totally
disabled
due
to
pneumoconiosis
arising
out
of
coal
mine
employment.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
it
doesn't
use
those
words--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--but
it
all
but
uses
the
words
because
it
specifically
says
that
you
obtain
the
presumption
by
invoking
the
presumption,
and
then
when
you
look
at
rebuttal
there
is
no
rebuttal
test
that
addresses
directly,
or
indirectly--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--i
believe
it
does
say
these
two
ways
and
no
others.
certainly
the
natural...
a
natural
reading
of
the
regulation
says
that
you
invoke
by
meeting
the
invocation
provisions,
and
then
when
you
wish
to,
when
the
opponent
is
going
to
rebut,
here
are
the
ways
that
you
can
rebut.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
right.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
well,
any
doubt
about
that
is
certainly
resolved,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
doubt
about
it
because
the
natural
reading
of
the
regulation,
i
think,
would
be
that
you
list
two
rebuttal
tests,
you
certainly...
a
disability
causation
under
the
statute
is
an
element.
it's
omitted
from
the
regulation.
something
essential
to
that,
when
it's
omitted...
but
the
manual,
the
manual--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--but
the...
but
hew
had
a,
had
a
line-drawing
problem,
and
if
they,
in
order
to
draw
a
line
that
would
have
excluded
the
car
accident
hypothetical
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
not
exclude
deserving
claimants.
and
that's
the
problem.
and
it
was
certainly
within
hew's
reasonable
exercise
of
its
rule-making
discretion
to
draw
that
line.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
the...
one
of
the
judgments
that
an
agency
would
make
is
what's
the
likelihood
that
there
will
be
cases
that
would
win
for,
with
respect
to
underserving
clients.
and...
because
you
can't
draw
a
line
that's
perfect.
and
as
i
said,
the
theoretical
possibility
that
a
car
accident
hypothetical
may...
that
the
person
in
the
car
accident
hypothetical
may
get
benefits
is
only
a
theoretical
possibility.
we
have
seen
no
evidence
that
any
such
person
ever
received
benefits,
or
any
other
undeserving
person
ever
received
benefits,
although
we
readily
acknowledge
that
it
was
theoretically
possible
under
the
regulations.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
these
three
cases
are,
we
think,
paradigm
cases
for
the
wisdom
of
hew's
rule.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
like
the
three
cases
here?
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
these
are...
these
are
absolutely
typical
kinds
of
cases
in
the
law.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
the
government
estimates
that
the
remaining
number
of
cases
is
anywhere
from
2,500
up
to
a
couple
thousand
more.
but
these
are
the
paradigm
cases.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
yeah,
when
i...
excuse
me,
justice
stevens.
what
i
meant
was
2,500
remaining
cases
out
there.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
well,
the
agency
had
to...
did
take
that
into
consideration,
and
the
comptroller
general's
report
that
talks
about
hew's
decisions
in
this
regard
makes
it
clear
just
now
difficult
it
is
to
tell
pneumoconiosis
apart
from
other
conditions.
and
they
weren't
just
other
respiratory
conditions.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
and
in...
that
is
so.
but
in
those
cases
the
medical
art
simply
could
not,
in
hew's
view,
be...
was
not
advanced
far
enough
at
the
time
then,
perhaps
also
now,
to
be
able
to
allow
the
determination
to
be
made
as
to
whether...
that
it
wasn't
pneumoconiosis.
and
so
hew
made
the
reasonable
decision
that
we're
going
to
look
at
the
reasonable
connection
between
having
pneumoconiosis
and
being
totally
disabled,
and
saying
that
the
reasonable
connection
is
that
the
disability
occurred.
in
other
words,
proving
the
fact
of
disability
causation
indirectly
was
in
their
view,
more...
a
more
accurate
endeavor
than
to
try
to
allow
physicians
to
prove
it
directly
when
the
state
of
the
medical
art
did
not
allow
that
determination.
the
other
point,
and
hew
also
was
under
instructions
from
congress.
congress
clearly
encouraged
hew
to
eliminate
this
huge
backlog
of
claims
using
interim
criteria.
and
the
comptroller
general's
report
says
that
one
of
the
primary
causes
for
this
backlog
of
claims
was
the...
this
inadequacy
in
the
state
of
the
medical
art
to
prove
disability
causation.
so
the
agency
says
look,
we've
got
to
eliminate
this,
we
have
this
problem
in
the
state
of
the
medical
art.
it's...
it
uses
lots
of
resources
for
us
to
get
doctors'
opinions
and
then
to
assess
them.
let's
eliminate...
follow
congress'
directive.
let's
eliminate
this
backlog
of
claims
and
at
the
same
time
follow
what
we
believe
the
state
of
the
medical
art
requires,
which
is
not
to
inquire
into
disability
causation
directly,
but
only
to
do
so
indirectly.
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
the...
but
again,
nothing
would
have
prevented
physicians
from
issuing
decisions
that
hew
had
already
determined
could
not
be
accurate.
if
they
believe
that
the
state
of
the
medical
art
is
inadequate,
and
physicians
nevertheless,
an
individual
physician
in
an
individual
case
is
asked
to
write
an
opinion,
that
opinion
may
be
one
that
says...
like
in
these
cases...
that
says
that
the
disability
causation
didn't
happen,
or
the
presence
of
pneumoconiosis
was
not
there
when
they
focussed
on
diseases
that
hew
said
you
can't
tell
from
pneumoconiosis.
you
can't
tell.
nothing
prevented
physicians
from
issuing
opinions,
but
hew
believed
those
opinions
were
not
accurate.
that's
why
hew
excluded
the
disability
causation
inquiry--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--no.
i
thought
you
were
positing
the
point.
let's
say
the
hew
interim
provision
did
allow
rebuttal--
mr.
julian
n.
henriques,
jr.
--well,
the,
the
backlog...
hew
still
would
have
had
to
assess
the
medical
evidence,
obtain
it
and
then
assess
it,
which
was
an
enormous
administrative
undertaking,
whether
or
not
it's
focussed
on
invocation
or
on
rebuttal.
that
doesn't
eliminate
the,
the
administrative
burden
of
the
backlog
of
claims.
the
way
to
eliminate
that
is
to
tell...
is
to
say
we're
no
longer
going
to
focus
on
that
evidence,
so
physicians
need
not
give
us
that
information.
now
i,
i...
the
reason
why
i
responded
to
your
statement
about
where
the
physicians
reports
come
from
is
that
i
thought
you
were
positing
the
question
of--
