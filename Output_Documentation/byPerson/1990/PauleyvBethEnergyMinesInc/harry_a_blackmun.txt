this
rather
complicated
litigation
concerns
the
federal
black
lung
benefits
program
created
to
provide
compensation
for
minors
disabled
due
to
pneumoconiosis
arising
out
of
coal
mine
employment.
we
have
before
us
three
cases,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
one
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
two
from
the
fourth
circuit.
they
center
on
regulations
issued
by
the
secretary
of
labor
under
a
congressional
directive
that
the
regulations
"shall
not
be
more
restrictive
than"
regulations
issued
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
when
that
department
administered
the
program
earlier.
there
are
statutory
presumptions
of
eligibility
and
provisions
allowing
the
agency
to
rebut
the
presumption
by
four
methods.
under
the
earlier
hew
regulations,
there
were
only
two
methods.
and
the
issue,
therefore,
is
whether
the
department
of
labor
regulations
are
more
restrictive.
the
third
circuit
ruled
that
they
were
not.
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
that
they
were.
so,
our
task
was
to
resolve
the
conflict.
we
hold
today
that
the
rebuttal
provisions
are
not
more
restrictive
and
thus,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
remand
those
cases.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
cases.
