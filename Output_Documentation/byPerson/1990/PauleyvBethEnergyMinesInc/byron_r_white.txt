justice
white
even
though
you
are
talking
about
to
rebut
the
presumption?
justice
white
yes,
but
nevertheless,
whatever
they
are
designed
for,
congress
has
said
that
the
department
of
labor
should
not
have
regulations
any
stricter
than
the...
than
hew.
justice
white
so
if
you
could
rebut...
if
you
couldn't
rebut
the
case
under
the
social
security
regulations
by
evidence
that
the
department
of
labor
permits...
isn't
that
one
of
the
claims
in
this
case?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
or
causation.
that
is
disability--
justice
white
--caused
by
it.
justice
white
well,
then,
i
suppose
it
would
follow
that
if
the
regulations
didn't
provide
for
rebuttal
on
those...
either
one
of
those
two
bases,
the
regulation
would
be
contrary
to
the
statute?
justice
white
mr.
henriques--
--do
you
think
that
would
be
valid
under
the
statute,
that
regulation?
justice
white
i
mean
at
the
time,
at
the
time.
justice
white
although
the
act
is
aimed
at
giving
benefits
to
those
who
have
this
disease
caused
by
coal
mining.
justice
white
and
so
they...
it
would
be
all
right
for
the
agency
to
say
well,
you
can't
offer
any
evidence
that
rebuts
the
notion
of
causation,
for
example.
justice
white
you
hope
it's
superficially.
[laughter]
justice
white
and...
let's
assume
that
the
state
of
the
medical
art
had
changed
between
then
and
now
so
that
you
really
can
determine
causation.
you
would
say,
nevertheless,
that
until
congress
changes
the
act
you
have
to
go
by
the
hew
regulation.
justice
white
well,
what
about
these
cases?
what
about
these
case?
the
issue
is
whether
you
can
prove...
be
allowed
to
prove
that
these
claimants
didn't
have
the
disease
or
that
the
disease
wasn't
caused
by
coal
mining.
and
you
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
we
can
assume
that
they
could
prove
it
by
present
medical
standards,
but
nevertheless
they
get
benefits.
justice
white
are
there
a
lot
of
these
cases
out
there
somewhere?
justice
white
like
these?
justice
white
how
many,
thousands
of
them?
