mr.
mark
e.
solomons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
black
lung
benefits
act
provides
a
workers'
compensation-type
benefit
to
coal
miners
and
their
families
on
account
of
total
disability
or
death
due
to
black
lung
disease.
the
statute
has
no
other
purpose.
in
the
cases
before
the
court,
the
fact
finders
have
determined
that
mr.
dayton
and
mr.
taylor
do
not
have
black
lung
disease.
mr.
pauley
had
an
early
stage
of
the
disease,
but
it
was
determined
in
his
case
that
he
had
no
disability
or
impairment
due
to
this
disease
at
all.
dayton,
taylor,
and
pauley
nevertheless
believe
that
they
are
entitled
to
be
compensated
for
totally
disabling
black
lung
disease,
even
though
they
do
not
have
it.
the
reason
that
they
give
is
that
a
fair
factual
inquiry
in
to
the
truth
of
the
matters
in
their
cases
is,
they
say,
prohibited
by
section
402(f)(2)
of
the
black
lung
benefits
act,
which
they
say
required
the
department
of
labor
to
write
eligibility
regulations
that
irrebuttably
presumed
their
entitlement
to
benefits.
the
department
of
labor
wrote
extremely
liberal
regulations
that
presumed
all
of
the
hard
parts
of
their
cases,
the
hard
factual
parts,
in
favor
of
the
claimants.
but
those
presumptions
are
not
irrebuttable.
the
questions
that
have
been
presented
here
this
morning
are,
first,
whether
section
402(f)(2)
of
the
black
lung
act
required
the
department
of
labor
to
enact
such
irrebuttable
presumptions,
and
secondly,
if
that...
if
it
did,
whether
section
402(f)(2)
is
constitutionally
viable
to
the
extent
that
it
irrebuttably
and
retroactively
imposes
upon
these
mine
operators
the
obligation
to
pay
for
harm
that
either
they
did
not
cause
or
that
does
not
exist.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
reach
the
due
process
questions
presented
because
section
402(f)(2)
does
not
prohibit
factual
inquiry
into
the
truth
in
these
cases.
we
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
act
in
its
context
leads
to
several
key
conclusions.
first
of
all,
the
irrebuttability
theory
that
is
presented
to
you
today
is
solely
and
exclusively
a
product
of
this
court's
decision
in
pittston
coal
group.
it
has
never
before
been
suggested.
if
these
cases
that
are
here
before
you
today
had
almost
20
years
ago
been
presented
to
the
social
security
administration
based
upon
the
records
that
are
here,
i
am
confident
that
they
would
have
been
denied.
the
claims
processors
working
for
that
agency
would
not
have
ignored
the
relevant
and
persuasive
evidence
that
these
people
did
not
have
pneumoconiosis
or
any
related
disability.
the
only
thing
that
we
can
document
that
the
social
security
administration
really
did
differently
is
that
it
did
not
do
much
to
defend
black
lung
claims.
it
wrote
regulations,
as
did
the
department
of
labor,
that
presumed
all
of
these
hard
parts
of
the
case
in
favor
of
the
claimant,
but
it
made
no
effort,
or
almost
no
effort,
to
assume
the
burden
that
it
placed
upon
itself.
it
is
this
practice,
we
believe,
that
the
claimants
want
this
court
to
revive.
they
don't
want
an
adversary.
they--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--the
burden
to
establish
that
the
miner
does
not
have
pneumoconiosis
or
that
any
disability
the
miner
has
did
not
arise
out
of
or
in
any
part
out
of
pneumoconiosis.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
justice
o'connor,
we
think
that
the
old
hew
regulations
were
clearly
open
to
such
proof.
we're
talking...
if
we're...
we're
talking
here--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--they
talk
about
it
indirectly.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
that
may
be
correct,
and
it's...
they're
very
difficult
to
read.
they're
messy
and
complex
regulations
that
were
adopted
by
the
social
security
administration.
but
nevertheless,
they
do
not
say
that
they
are
irrebuttable.
and
through
the
cross-references,
which
is
apparently
the
way
the
social
security
administration
regulated
in
those
days,
you
get
to,
and
not
on
a
very
hard
path,
you
get
to
provisions
within
those
regulations
that
raise
criteria
that
are
identical
to
those
criteria
that
the
department
of
labor
put
in
its
regulations.
the
department
of
labor's
regulations
are
neater.
the
department
of
labor's
regulations
are
designed
for
adversary
proceedings.
and
i
think
in
all
of
the
attention
this
has
gotten,
and
not
only
from
this
court...
and
this
court
has
had
this
before
it
three
times
and
there
is
a
fourth
case
waiting
in
the
wings,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
seen
it
many
times...
one
thing
that
we
have
not
yet
focussed
upon
in
looking
at
and
comparing
the
social
security
regulations
with
the
department
of
labor's
regulations
is
that
they
are
designed
for
different
audiences
and
for
different
purposes.
the
department
of
labor's
regulation
is
designed
for
adversary
proceedings
and
for
application
by
judges,
administrative
law
judges
or
other
judges.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
that's
right.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
that
is
the
claim.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
we
think
that
the
department...
the
social
security
regulations,
if
you
go
through
them,
and
they
don't
work
very
neatly,
but
if
you
do
go
through
them,
each
one
of
those
issues
is
open
to
factual
inquiry.
every
single
one
of
them.
all
you
have
to
do
is
follow
the
cross-references.
but
as
i
said--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--what
we
do
know...
now
there
are...
there
are
very
few
cases
that
arise
out
of
the
social
security
program.
i
think
there
are
probably
no
more
than
100
or
200
published
decisions
out
of
600,000
cases.
there
are
a
couple
of
cases
which,
which
show
that
the
social
security
administration,
at
least
when
they
got
to
court,
never
treated
this
presumption
as
being
exclusive
of
anything.
it
was
just
an
administrative
rule.
and
one
of
the
cases
we
cited,
farmer
v.
weinberger,
the
agency
came
in
and
argued
that
you
rebutted
a
death
claim
under
the
part
that
says
rebuttal.
in
another
case,
much
later
on,
they
came
in
and
they
did,
as
we
suggest,
apply
a
primary
reason
test
to
disability
causation.
there
are
very
few
cases.
but
what
we
do
know,
and
we
readily
concede
that
the
factual
issues
that
are
presented
in
these
kinds
of
cases
are
difficult
ones,
and
they
cannot
be
decided
without
expert
testimony,
without
medical
evidence.
the
social
security
administration
did
not
get
the
kind
of
expert
testimony
that
exists
in
these
cases.
now,
there
is
nothing
anyplace
that
anybody
has
been
able
to
find
that
show
that
these
presumptions
were
rebuttable
or
that
social
security
claims
personnel
were
unable
to
look
at
evidence
that
came
in
the
door.
they're
not
trained
to
function
that
way,
it
seems
to
me.
they
are
trained
to
look
at
what
comes
in
the
door.
nobody
told
them
not
to
do
that.
and
it
seems
that
that's
what
they
would
have
done
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
except
that
the
agency,
it
said
because
it
lacked
resources,
it
said
because
there
were
not
enough
testing
facilities
in
coal
mining
regions,
it
said
that
these
were
very
hard
questions
and
they
didn't
really
know
exactly
how
to
resolve
them,
and
so
they
didn't
do
anything.
but
let
me
suggest
to
you
that
that
is
not
a
criterion.
that
a
lack
of
resources
is
not
a
criterion
that
is
picked
up
by
this
statute.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
they
did
not
develop
the
hard
evidence,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
the
hard
evidence
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
you
need
to
prove
that
a
miner's
disability,
if
in
fact
he
has
a
respiratory
impairment,
is
not
due
to
black
lung
disease.
that
is
hard
evidence.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
disability
causation.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
that's
right.
it
is
hard
to
show
but
by
no
means
impossible.
it's
shown
all
the
time,
but
it
is
hard
to
show
that
an
individual
who
has
pulmonary
impairment,
whether
that
impairment
in
fact
arose
out
of
the
miner's
coal
mine
employment,
that's
hard
too.
but
the
agency
didn't
do
it.
they
said
they
didn't
do
it.
they
reported
to
congress
that
they
didn't
do
it
and
that
they
couldn't
do
it,
and
that
they
didn't
have
the
resources.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
they
created
a
presumption
for
use
by
their
claims
personnel,
which
to
me
looks
to
some
degree
like
the
social
security
grid.
it
doesn't
have
an
invocation
section.
what
it
does
is
it
moves
through
the
steps
in
the
case
and
at
each
step
in
the
presumption,
in
this
section
410-490,
you
look
at
a
different
issue
of
ultimate
fact.
but
the
way
the
regulation
is
set
up,
and
the
department
of
labor
certainly
followed
this,
is
they
did
it
in
a
way
so
that
the
fact
was
presumed
on
the
basis
of
something.
if
there
was
nothing
there
when
the
claims
processor
is
looking
at
it
he
moves
along
to
the
next
step.
that's
not
the
way
the
labor
presumption
worked,
but
nevertheless
the
labor
presumption
is
not
more
restrictive.
we
think
that
the
labor
presumption
is
less
restrictive
in
several
ways.
we
think
that
the
labor
presumption
is
more
favorable
to
claimants
and
that
it
probably
had
to
be,
because
there
was
going
to
be
adversity
in
these
cases,
and
labor
knew
that.
and
there
was
no
adversity
in
the
social
security
cases
and
they
did
not
need
to
be
precise
in
designing
a
standard
for
application
by
judges
in
formal
proceedings,
as
the
labor
department
did.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
labor
department
was
an
outlaw
agency.
the
labor
department
did
what
it
was
told
to
do,
and
the
labor
department,
i
think,
favoring
claimants
at
a
time
when
the
agency
itself
was
very
much
in
favor
of
this
legislation,
the
labor
department
did
an
excellent
job
in
establishing
a
rule
which
is
extremely
liberal.
it
caused
a
1,200
percent
increase
in
the
claims
that
they
were...
that
they
were
reviewing,
in
the
approvals
of
claims
that
they
were
reviewing.
this
agency
was
not
an
outlaw.
it
was
not
a
rogue
agency.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
i
would
like
to
address
some
of
the
points
that
were
made
with
respect
to
the
gao
study.
although
i
think
that
it
is
of
limited
significance,
nevertheless,
this
was
an
investigation
by
the
investigative
arm
of
congress.
they
came
in,
they
leveled
charges
at
the
agency,
said
you're
not
doing
these
things
that
you
ought
to
be
doing.
and
the
agency
came
back
and
they
said,
oh,
well,
it's
real
hard
to
do
them,
and
we
don't
have
the
resources
to
do
them.
and
then
on
the
medical
issues
they
said
that...
and
this,
by
the
way,
as
far
as
we
know,
never
appeared
in
any
congressional
materials...
they
said,
citing
a
magazine
article,
that
it's
very
difficult
to
make
these
kinds
of
factual
determinations.
this
is
one
of
the
most
studied
diseases
on
the
face
of
the
earth.
a
magazine
article
is
hardly
proof
of
anything
in
any
form,
it
seems
to
me.
but
one
of
the
things
that's
very
interesting,
the...
looking
only
at
this
gao
report.
social
security
on
page
36
of
the
report
told
the
investigators...
i
will
read
it
to
you.
social
security
officials
told
us
that
benefits
were
almost
always
denied
in
cases
of
deaths
which
occurred
less
than
24
hours
after
onset
of
acute
diseases
or
traumas
such
as
coronary
occlusions
or
so
forth
and
so
on.
i
don't
have
a
crystal
ball
to
go
back
and
tell
you
precisely
how
ssa
would
have
handled
any
particular
case,
but
neither
do
the
claimants.
it
seems
to
me,
however,
that
if
they
wanted
to
do
something
as
radical
as
to
adopt
a...
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
to
tell
their
employees,
who
have
very
few
of
those
kinds
of
rebuttable
presumptions
in
the
jobs
that
they
do,
that
this
is
the
way
you're
going
to
do
it,
you're
going
to
ignore
evidence
of
certain
types
in
these
cases,
that
they
would
have
done
it
somewhat
more
clearly
than
they
did.
and
in
fact
there
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption
in
the
statute,
and
they
did
instruct
their
employees
how
to
use
it.
but
this
presumption,
the
social
security
presumption,
is
not
one
that
was
irrebuttable.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
criteria
in
section
402(f)(2).
it's
a
broad
word.
it
doesn't
say
adopt
their
regulation.
it
says
adopt
the
criteria
applicable.
the
criteria
applicable
include
the
statute,
which
had
lots
of
criteria
in
them,
and
in
many
cases
the
responses
of
the
claimants
to
that
is
that
these
are
effectively
repealed
by
implication.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
make
a
case
for
that.
it
includes
the
interim
adjudicatory
criteria,
and
it
includes
the
rest
of
social
security's
regulations
to
the
extent
that
they
are
applicable.
those
regulations
bring
in,
we
think
very
clearly...
as
by
the
way
does
the
manual.
i
think
the
manual
is
devastating
to
this
case
because
the
manual
brings
in
all
sorts
of
factual
inquiries,
as
i
read
it,
into
causation
and
disease
and
anything
that
comes
in.
but
let
me
address
what's
not
a
criterion,
i
think.
obtuseness
in
the
drafting
of
this
regulation
is
not
a
criterion.
a
lack
of
resources
on
the
part
of
the
social
security
administration
is
not
a
criterion.
failure
to
file...
follow
the
federal
register
style
handbook,
and
not
using...
overusing
cross-references
is
not
a
criterion.
and
the
state
of
the
medical
art
in
1972
is
not
a
criterion
either.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
department
of
labor
again
did
the
job
that
it
was
supposed
to
do
here.
thank
you.
