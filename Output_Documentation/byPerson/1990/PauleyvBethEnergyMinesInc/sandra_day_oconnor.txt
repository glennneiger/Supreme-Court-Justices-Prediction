mr.
solomons,
would
it
have
been
open
to
such
proof
under
the
old
hew
regulations?
justice
o'connor
they
don't
talk
about
it
directly.
justice
o'connor
in
fact,
it
is
not
clear,
i
think,
what
would
have
happened
under
those
old
regulations.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
we
know
how
it
was
applied
by
hew?
justice
o'connor
and
how
do
we
know
that?
from
what?
from
a
report?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
is
it
that
hew
reported
to
the
contrary
to
the
gao,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
explain,
then,
the
hew
report
to
the
gao?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
it
also
established
that
some
claims
were
denied,
for
instance
the
auto
accident
case.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but--
--well,
how
is
it
reasonable,
though,
to
draw
a
line
that
is
contrary
to
the
whole
thrust
of
the
statute?
i
just
don't
understand
how
such
a
regulatory
scheme
could
possibly
be
deemed
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
