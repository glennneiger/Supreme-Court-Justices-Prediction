mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
o'connor,
in
response
to
your
question,
we
know
relatively
little
about
how
hew
administered
the
program,
but
let
me
call
to
your
attention
two
things
that
we
do
know
that
were
reported
in
one
of
the
gao
reports
and
in
the
congressional
legislative
history.
hew
reported
that
in
cases
where
the
record
before
it
showed
that
a
miner
died
from
an
automobile
accident
or
from
a
malignancy
in
another
organ
of
the
body,
it
did
not
award
benefits.
we
think
that
that
shows
that
it
would
have
done
the
same
thing
in
a
case
where
the
evidence--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
gao
report
that's
cited
and
the
congressional
record
testimony.
we
have
cited
both
of
those
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
and
justice
white,
in
response
to
your
question,
you
paraphrase
section
402(f)(2)
in
a
way
that
i
know
we
sometimes
do,
that
it
said
that
labor
was
to
adopt
hew's
regulation.
what
section
402(f)(2)
actually
says
is
that
labor
is
to
apply
criteria
no
more
restrictive
than
those
applicable
on
june
30,
1973.
now,
hew's
regulation
was
applicable
on
that
date,
but
so
was...
so
were
many
other
things,
including
part
b
of
the
act
generally.
and
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
the
act
provides
repeatedly
that
black
lung
benefits
are
only
to
be
awarded
to
persons
who
are
totally
disabled
due
to
pneumoconiosis.
the
phrase
"due
to
pneumoconiosis"
captures
both
the
requirement
that
the
miner
must
have
the
disease,
and
the
requirement
that
his
disability
must
be
caused
by
the
disease.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
our
position
exactly,
justice
white.
the
first
section
of
the
black
lung
benefits
act
says
that
its
purpose
is
to
provide
benefits
to
miners
totally
disabled
due
to
pneumoconiosis.
the
section
authorizing
hew
to
promulgate
regulations
says
that
it
is
to
set
forth
standards
to
determine
whether
a
miner
is
totally
disabled
due
to
pneumoconiosis.
the
rate
schedules
have
a
provision
for
miners
totally
disabled
due
to
pneumoconiosis.
no
provision
of
the
act
hints
that
anyone
who
is...
does
not
have
black
lung
disease
or
is
disabled
by
some
other
cause
is
entitled
to
benefits.
the
three
words,
due
to
pneumoconiosis,
in
effect
summarize
labor's
third
and
fourth
rebuttal
provisions,
the
provisions
at
issue
in
this
case.
we
don't
think
that
a
regulation
that
implements
the
statute
is
contrary
to
the
statute.
dayton
and
taylor,
who
do
not
have
the
disease,
do
not
suggest
any
reason
why
they
should
be
entitled
to
benefits.
pauley
suggests
that
she
should
be
awarded
benefits
because
it's
too
difficult
to
determine
what
caused
the
disability.
well,
as
i
have
just
stated,
the
statute
repeatedly
sets
forth
a
causation
requirement,
so
congress
clearly
thought
that
it
was
possible.
as
mr.
solomons
says,
doctors
and
agencies
have
been
determining
causes
of
disabilities
for
years
under
this
program.
in
many
cases
it
is
obviously
quite
simple.
the
automobile
accident
hypothetical
reveals
a
lot
in
our
view.
the
claimants
have
absolutely
no
argument
as
to
why
benefits
should
not
be
awarded
in
such
a
case,
and
it
seems
quite
clear
to
us
that
congress
did
not
intend
such
a
result,
which
can
fairly
be
characterized
as
absurd
under
the
statute.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
would
be
very
happy
to
acknowledge
that,
justice
scalia.
i
would
say
that
we
do
agree
on
how
you
get
there
with
respect
to
miners
not
having...
who
don't
have
black
lung
disease.
we
have
actually
emphasized
different
routes
for
miners
who
are
not
totally
disabled,
but
we
have
both
endorsed
each
others
positions
on
that
issue
as
well.
we
think
this
court's
decision
in
the
turner
elkhorn
case
is
very
instructive.
that
decision
was
handed
down
in
1976,
2
years
before
section
402(f)(2)
was
adopted.
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
act,
the
one
provision
that
sets
forth
an
irrebuttable
presumption
for
miners
with
the
advanced
stage
of
the
disease,
what
was
at
issue.
this
court
rejected
the
coal
company's
claims
that
that
presumption
was
affirmant
of
the
due
process
clause.
but
even
with
respect
to
it
the
court
said
that
it's
perfectly
clear
under
the
act
that
an
operator
can
be
liable
only
for
pneumoconiosis
arising
out
of
employment
in
a
coal
mine,
even
though
that
particular
provision
didn't
say
that
in
so
many
words.
we
think
that
congress,
acting
2
years
later
in
adopting
section
402(f)(2),
must
have
also
thought
it
perfectly
evident
under
the
act
that
an
operator
can
be
liable
only
for
pneumoconiosis
arising
out
of
employment
in
a
coal
mine.
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
an
argument
that
the
claimants
have
suggested
with
respect
to
the
black
lung
disability
trust
fund.
they
suggested
that
even
if
the
operators
can't
be
liable
where
a
miner
is
not
totally
disabled
due
to
pneumoconiosis,
the
black
lung
disability
trust
fund
can.
and
they
think
that
this
avoids
the
constitutional
problems.
now
we
disagree
on
that.
we
don't
see
how
it
really
makes
a
difference
whether
an
operator
pays
or
whether
a
fund
that
is
funded
by
a
tax
on
coal
sold
by
coal
companies
pays.
but
we'd
also
like
to
note
that
the
black
lung
disability
trust
fund
by
its
name
seems
to
imply
that
it
gives
awards
in
cases
involving
black
lung
disability.
and
furthermore
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
provision
of
the
act
that
they
rely
on
in
making
this
argument
just
doesn't
support
their
position
at
all.
that's
section
422(c)
of
the
act,
which
says
that
no
operator
shall
be
responsible
for
paying
benefits
to
a
miner
whose
disability
did
not
arise
at
least
in
part
out
of
employment
in
a
mine
during
a
period
after
december
31,
1969,
when
it
was
operated
by
such
miner.
that
provision
just
says
that
the
trust
fund
pays
benefits
where
the
miner
stopped
working
before
the
black
lung
benefits
act
was
enacted,
just
as
it
does
in
cases
where
the
operator
isn't
solvent
or
for
some
other
reason
isn't
paying
benefits.
it
does
not
suggest
in
any
way
that
the
black
lung
disability
trust
fund
is
available
where
a
miner
either
does
not
have
black
lung
disease
or
is
not
disabled
by
it.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
