justice
scalia
let's
acknowledge,
mr.
wright,
however,
that
it's
very...
it's
very
hard
to
get
there
through
the
hew
regulations.
and
you
and
the
mining
companies
don't
even
agree
on
how
you
get
there
through
the
hew
regulations.
justice
scalia
of
course
it's
hard
to
get
anywhere
through
the
hew
regulations.
i
can
understand
that.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
although
you
don't
think
it
modifies
the
criteria
to
update
medical
science
for
purposes
of
determining
whether...
whether
your
client
has
black
lung
disease.
but
only...
it
only
altered
because...
the
first
point
that
was
put
to
you
by
justice
stevens:
why
isn't
it
that
the
miner
here
who
benefitted
by
the
updating
in
medical
knowledge,
why
doesn't
he
have
a
much
more
liberal
criterion
applied
to
him
than
hew
applied.
and
you
said
well,
you
know,
medical
knowledge
has
advanced
and
we
use
it.
but
you
only
use
it
on
one
side.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
not
just
two
different
agencies;
it's
20
years.
i
mean,
that's,
that's
a
lot
of
time
in
medical
technology.
justice
scalia
are
you
saying
that
in
no
case
was
the
medical
art
with
respect
to
the
two
additional
criteria,
in
no
case
could
it
demonstrate
that
pneumo...
say
it
for
me.
justice
scalia
there
it
is.
[laughter]
in
no
case
could
it
determine
that
that
didn't
exist?
justice
scalia
well,
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
violation
of
the
statute,
if
the
statute
says
you
have
to
have
black
lung
disease
and
it
has
to
have
been
caused
by
coal
mining,
and
if
at
least
in
some
cases
the
medical
technology,
as
crude
as
it
was,
could
demonstrate
absolutely
that
you
didn't
have
it
or
that
you
didn't
get
it
from
coal
mining,
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
for
hew
to
say
absolutely
you
can't
use
it
in
any
case?
justice
scalia
well,
but
this
is
a
rebuttal.
i
mean,
the
burden
is
on
the
employer,
at
that
time
on
hew.
your
client
gets
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
but
in
at
least,
if
in
one
case
in
100
i
can
come
in
and
show
conclusively
that
this
is
true,
what
harm
is
there
in
letting
me
show
that?
justice
scalia
no
problem.
then
the
employee
wins.
justice
scalia
mr.
henriques,
i
didn't
think
that
the
car
accident
hypothetical
was
one
that
had
been
invented.
i...
my
recollection
was
that
that
was
something
contained
in
the...
in
the
report
to
the
gao.
is
it...
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
fraught
with
problems
if
it
was
in
the
regulation,
but--
justice
scalia
--i
see.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
say
only.
it
could
have
said
only
very
easily.
section
c
says
the
presumption
in
paragraph
b
may
be
rebutted
if.
justice
scalia
if
could
have
said
may
be
rebutted
only
if,
if
it
really
meant
that
those
are
the
only
ways
to
do
it.
justice
scalia
well,
that
might
be
a
natural
reading
if
it
wouldn't
lead
to
such
a
natural
result
that
somebody
who
dies
in
an
automobile
accident
gets
compensated
for
dying
from
black
lung.
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
natural
meaning.
justice
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
you
eliminate
the
backlog
just
as
effectively
by
simply
adopting
a
presumption
and
then,
although
you
may
have
ability
to
rebutting
it...
to
rebut
it,
simply
not
rebutting
it.
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
where
these
physicians
would
come
from.
i
assume
hew
is
in
charge
of
the
investigation,
either
hew
or
the
claimant.
and
if
hew
doesn't
ask
the
physician
for
these
kinds
of
studies
that
they...
that
they
think
aren't
worth
anything...
are
these
roaming
physicians
that
would
just
come
in
and
say
by
the
way,
i
have
a
study
i
want
you
to
hear
about
in
this
case?
justice
scalia
no.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
hew
could
get
rid
of
its
backlog
very
easily,
as
it
did,
by
adopting
presumptions.
and
if
there
is
nothing
brought
in
to
refute
them,
the
presumptions
will
carry
the
day.
that
would...
that
would
get
rid
of
the
backlog.
