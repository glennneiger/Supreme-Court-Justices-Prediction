mr.

chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
lack
of
resources
resulted
in
the
social
security
administration's
not
developing
any
evidence
of
its
own?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
hard
evidence
as
opposed
to
soft
evidence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that's
why
the
social
security
people
resolved
cases
the
way
they
did,
not
because
of
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
but
because
there
was
no
evidence
supporting
the
other
view?

well,
mr.
solomons.

chief
justice
rehnquist
your
opponents
disagree
with
you
as
to
the
rebuttability
of
the
hew
systems,
don't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
does
the
legislative
history
cover
whether

medical
art
has
advanced?
they
were
leaving
that
to
fact
finders.
