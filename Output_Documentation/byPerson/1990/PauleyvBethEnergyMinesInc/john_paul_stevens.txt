justice
stevens
isn't
that
why
they
didn't
allow
the...
this
particular
type
of
medical
evidence
to
create
the
presumption
under
the
old
regulation?
justice
stevens
and
isn't
it
true,
therefore,
that,
which...
i
don't
remember
which
it
was
now,
but
the
particular
miner
who
proved
his
case
by
those
studies
would
have
failed
under
the
hew
regulations?
justice
stevens
it
seemed
to
me
that
was
rather
clear
as
to
that
one
miner.
justice
stevens
and
therefore
it's
a
little
hard
to
see
how
he
can
be
claiming
that
the
social...
department
of
labor
regulation
is
more
restrictive
than
the
hew
regulation.
justice
stevens
but
taylor
relied
on
the
blood
gas
studies--
justice
stevens
--which
would
not
have
entitled
him
to
the
presumption
under
the
hew
regulation.
justice
stevens
well,
that
may
well
be
true,
but
this
is
a
case,
it
seems
to
me,
which
clearly
would
have
failed
under
the
prior
regulation,
so
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
how
the
department
of
labor
regulation,
at
least
as
to
that
miner,
is
more
restrictive.
justice
stevens
this
word
"criteria"
has
troubled
us
in
the
past.
justice
stevens
i
thought
they
argued
that
these
miners
fit
that
category
because
they
didn't
have
the
disease.
why
aren't
these
just
like
somebody
who
got
killed
in
an
automobile
accident--
justice
stevens
--who
had
been
in
the
mines
for
10
years
and
had
pneumonia
or
something
else,
you
know?
justice
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
they?
i
don't
understand
why
they
wouldn't
if
they
were
in
the
mines
for
10
years
and
they
had
had
some...
some
ailment
that
was,
you
know,
qualified
for
the
presumption,
why
wouldn't
they
recover?
why
wouldn't
they
recover
under
your
view
of
the
earlier--
justice
stevens
--they
would
have.
justice
stevens
even
if
they
could
prove
later
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
they
did
not
have
serious
pneumonoconiosis...
if
that's
the
way
you
pronounce
it...
and
also
that
they,
rather
the
cause
of
their
disability
was
an
automobile
accident?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing?
when
you
say
hew
regulation
or
the
manual
that
you...
i
haven't
looked
at
the
manual.
justice
stevens
a
term...
well,
who,
who
introduced
the
word
"conclusively"?
justice
stevens
oh,
well.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
as
i
remember
the
text
of
the
regulation,
it
does
not
say
that
the
presumption
is
irrebuttable
or
conclusive.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
no,
that's
true,
but
supposing,
for
example,
after
they
get
all
through
they
find
out
that
the
man
is
just...
is
a
forgery.
i
mean,
there...
sometimes
you
can
rebut
claims
in
ways
that
are
not
spelled
out
as
the
normal
methods
of
rebuttal.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
follows
because
you
have
two
methods
of
rebuttal
specified
in
the
regulation
that
that's
an
exhaustive
list.
it
doesn't
say
these
two
ways
and
no
others.
justice
stevens
well,
but
not
2,500
cases
in
which
the
alj
has
found
there
was
either
no
causation
or
no
black
lung
disease
at
all.
justice
stevens
remain.
and
there
are
some
of
those
in
which
the
employer
bore
the
burden...
you
see,
the
thing
that
troubles
me
about
your
argument
is
that
all
this
uncertainty
means
that
once
the
miner
gets
the
benefit
of
the
presumption
he
is
normally
going
to
win,
because
the
uncertainty
makes
it
very
difficult
to
rebut
the
presumption.
but
if
you
do
have
the
unusual
case
in
which
the
evidence
clearly
establishes
the
absence
of
the
disease
or
the
absence
of
causation,
it
seems
to
me
there
it's
rather
unusual
to
say
we
just
won't
permit
the
rebuttal
to
come
in.
because
then
the
miner
is
getting
not
only
the
benefit
of
the
uncertainty,
but
the
benefit
of
a
conclusive
presumption
that
i
don't
see
mentioned
anywhere
in
any
of
the
materials.
justice
stevens
which
means
that
in
99
cases
out
of
100
close
cases
the
miner
will
win
when
he
gets
the
presumption.
