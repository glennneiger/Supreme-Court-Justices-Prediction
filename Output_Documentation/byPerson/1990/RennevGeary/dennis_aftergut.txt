mr.
dennis
aftergut
rennie,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
rennie.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
article
ii,
section
6(b)
of
the
california
constitution
provides
that
no
political
party
or
central
committee
shall
endorse,
support,
or
oppose
candidates
in
nonpartisan
elections...
that
is,
elections
for
judicial,
school,
county,
or
city
office.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
people
of
california
may
in
the
nonpartisan
arena
restrict
the
speech
of
those
parties
that
have
chosen
to
accept
the
benefits
that
the
state
confers
upon
its
official
parties
in
the
partisan
arena.
and
because
our
argument
so
involves
these
special
advantages,
i
begin
by
describing
them
for
the
court,
how
parties
get
those
advantages,
and
then
i
proceed
to
discuss
how
they
justify
the
balance
that
the
people
of
california
have
sought
to
strike
between
their
two
systems,
their
partisan
system
and
their
nonpartisan
system.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
the
respondents
include
some
voters,
your
honor,
and
they
include
some
individual
members
of
local
central
committees...
that
is
the
local
organ
in
california
of
the
state
party.
but
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
the
respondents
are
not
parties
themselves.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
only
as
amici,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
well,
these
respondents,
your
honor,
seek...
the
way
the
case
arises
is
they
had...
they
sought
to
place
in
the
san
francisco
voter
pamphlet
endorsements
either
of
them
or
endorsements
by
the
committees
of
which
they
were
a
member.
and
they
sought
to
have
that
endorsement
circulated
through
the
government's
publication,
the
ballot
pamphlet
to
all
voters.
that's
how
the
case
arises.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
although
i
can't
answer
that
question
for
sure.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
the
way
that
the
official
parties
in
california
become
official
parties
is
by
choice.
that
is
california
election
code
section
9951
provides
the
mechanism
by
which
a
group
seeks
to
become
an
official
party.
and
i
should
also
say
that
section
35
of
the
california
election
code
defines
parties
as
ballot-qualified
parties,
so
that
when
article
ii,
section
6(b)
refers
to
parties,
it
is
referring
to
ballot-qualified
parties,
that
is
those
who
have
chosen
to
take
advantage
of
the
statutory
benefits.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
yes.
the--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--the
san
francisco
registrar
of
voters.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
yes.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
in
a
pamphlet
that
is
sent
to
all
voters
in
the
city,
and
which
we
contend
would
make
a
nonpartisan
election
partisan
because
these
endorsements
would
go
to
every
voter
in
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that
the
state
law
forbade
endorsements
in
nonpartisan
elections.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
yes.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct.
support
would
include
that.
the
advantages
that
political
parties,
official
political
parties,
ballot-qualified
political
parties
get,
parties
that
have
chosen
to
become
official
parties,
are
a
vast
array
of
benefits.
i
want
to
go
through
them
quickly
for
the
court
so
the
court
understands.
first,
a
ballot-qualified
party
is
a
party
that
has
guaranteed
access
to
the
partisan
ballot,
to
the
statewide
ballot.
second,
the
state
operates
the
primaries
for
those
ballot-qualified
parties.
third,
the
state
assists
those
parties
in
expanding
their
affiliation
in
a
very
special
way.
the
voter
registration
card
includes
a
list
of
the
ballot-qualified
parties
and
only
the
ballot-qualified
parties,
so
that
a
voter
registering
marks
which
party
he
or
she
wishes
to
affiliate
with.
fourth,
the
parties
are
entitled
to
receive
free
of
charge
from
the
state
a
copy
of
the
list
of
voter
affiliation...
of
the
registered
voters
and
their
affiliation.
fifth,
the
official
parties
may
send
to
this,
to
the
individuals
on
this
list,
those
people
that
the
state
has
helped
the
parties
affiliate
with,
may
send
them
free
of
charge
a
solicitation
letter
allowing
the
parties
to
collect
funds
from
these
individuals.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
it
is
sent
without
expense
to
the
party
with
the
sample
ballot
and
the
voter
pamphlet
that
go
out.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
state
law
provides
for
that.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
the
state
pays
the
postage.
it
can
go
out...
the
letter
and
the
solicitation
envelope
goes
out.
sixth,
the
state
allows
parties
to
receive
a
$25
tax
contribution
on
the
income
tax
form
dedicated
to
that
party.
seventh,
the
party
meetings,
the
central
committee
meetings,
occur
in
the
seat
of
government,
in
the
city
hall,
called
by
the
clerk.
this
is
an
array
of
advantages
that
is
unique
in
its
scope.
and
why
has
california
chosen
to
give
its
official
parties,
those
that
have
chosen
to
become
parties,
why
has
california
chosen
to
give
them
more
advantages
than
any
other
state?
the
reason
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
california
itself,
and
has
to
do
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
ballot
access
area.
california,
being
the
largest
of
our
states
and
being
a
state
of
tremendous
diversity,
finds
a
need
to
promote
parties
in
order
to
promote
stability
in
such
a
large
and
diverse
state,
in
order
to...
parties
help
forge
consensus
among
diverse
groups,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
storer
case,
in
the
jenness
case,
in
the
american
party
v.
white
case.
and
parties
help
prevent
a
balkanization
of
the
political
process
so
that
government
can
operate.
so
california
has
chosen
to
structure
its
government,
the
people
of
california
have
chosen
to
structure
their
government
in
this
way,
strengthening
the
parties.
but
there
is
a
danger.
the
danger
is
that
california
at
the
same
time
has
coexisting
a
nonpartisan
system,
a
strong
nonpartisan
system,
a
long
tradition
of
nonpartisanship
that
goes
back
to
the
progressive
era
in
hiram
johnson.
and
that
commitment
to
nonpartisanship
in
fact
is
stronger
than
any
other
state
because
california
is
the
only
state
in
the
country
which
absolutely
prohibits
nonpartisan
nomination
in
all
local
and
all
school--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--excuse
me,
prohibits
partisan
nominations
in
all
local,
all
city,
all
county,
all
school,
all
judicial
elections.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct.
that
is
the...
an
injunction--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--yes.
and
that
is
the
only
sanction
that
exists
in
the
state
of
california.
in
other
words,
there's
no
criminal
penalty
for
an
official
party's
endorsing.
it's
simply
that
some--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--well,
the--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--the
government
could
bring
an
action
to
enjoin
that,
or
an
individual
could
bring
an
action
to
enjoin
that,
as
happened
in
the
unger
case.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
for
the
reasons
that
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
this
is
an
essential
part
of
the
structure
of
government
that
california
has
chosen.
that
is
to
say
at
the
same--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
develop
in
terms
of
a
difference
that
exists
in
california.
and
that
is
to
say
california
gives
to
those
parties
that
have
chosen
to
become
official
parties
this
vast
array
of
benefits.
and
then
secondly,
california
has
this
uniquely
strong
comprehensive
commitment
to
nonpartisanship.
and
so
what
california
is
saying
when
it
speaks
to
its
official
parties,
those
that
have
made
the
choice
of
becoming
official
parties,
it
has
given
to
them
a
choice.
and
it
has
said
you
may
have
this
vast
array
of
advantages
in
order
to
assist
in
organizing
our
political
system
across
the
state.
but
with
that
vast
array
of
benefits
there
is
a
danger.
and
the
danger
is
that
the
state...
the
state
by
giving
to
parties
that
have
chosen
to
take
advantage
of
these
benefits...
the
state
itself
will
be
weighing
into
the
nonpartisan
arena.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
where
the
state
has
a
sufficiently
compelling
interest
and
where
the
people
of
california
have
said
this
is
how
we
wish
to
structure
our
government.
we
structure
our
government
by
having
a
strong
partisan,
strong
party
role
at
the
state
level.
we
need
it
in
our
state.
but
at
the
same
time
we
have
a
strong
nonpartisan
system.
and
the
danger
is
that
the
state
has...
that
these
benefits
that
the
parties
have
chosen
to
take,
these
benefits
enhance
the
voice,
amplify
the
voice
of
parties
in
a
way
that
will
put
them,
if
they
may
endorse,
back
at
the
center
of
the
nonpartisan
arena
where
nonpartisanship
envisions
they
do
not
play
the
central
part.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
official...
the
answer
is
i
believe
you're
correct
that
official
parties
are
required,
although
i
am
not,
i
must
say
i
am
not
certain.
but
the
point
is--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--but
the
point
is
that
the...
that
may
be
so
with
respect
to
that
particular
regulation,
your
honor.
but
the
point
is
that
the
party
has
the
choice.
the
party
has
the
choice
of
not
accepting
those
benefits
and
of
being
like
anybody
else
in
the
nonpartisan
arena.
they
can
speak
however
loudly
they
want
in
the
nonpartisan
arena.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
the
party
does
not
need
to
take
advantage
of
these
benefits,
your
honor,
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
the
regular
meetings.
but
the
others
are
not
regulations.
the
party
does
not
have
to
nominate,
does
not
have
to
have
guaranteed
access,
it
doesn't
have
to
take
advantage
of
these
benefits.
it
has...
it
makes
the
choice--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--the
democratic
party
can...
the
democratic
party
can,
absolutely,
get
its
candidate
on
the
ballot
for...
i'm
not
sure
about
for
a
primary
election,
but
it
can
definitely--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--it
can
get
its
candidate
on
the
ballot
by
doing
what
any
other
group
does,
and
that
is
by
gathering
the
number
of
signatures
that
are
necessary
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot.
the
democratic
party
has
chosen
to
take
advantage
of
these
benefits,
and
the
price
for
taking
advantage
of
those
benefits
that
california
exacts
in
order
to
protect
the
nonpartisan
structure
of
its
government
from
the
enhanced
voice
that
these
benefits
give
to
parties
is
to
say
we
need
this
restriction
in
order
to
keep
parties
from
occupying
the
central
place
in
local
government
and
in
judicial
government.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
can
give
the
court
the
statute.
i'm
not
sure
i
have
it
in
mind.
it's--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
i
believe...
i
am
really
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct.
and--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
um-hum.
but
the
point
is
that
the
party
may
operate
like
anybody
else
if
it...
if
the
party
chooses
not
to
take
advantage
of
these
benefits
that
the
state
confers.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
right.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
it...
that
party,
it
could
choose
its
candidate
in
any
way
that
it
wished.
whether
it
would
be,
i
do
not
believe
that...
if
it
were
not
an
official
party
it
would
not
have
a
state-run
primary,
but
it
could
choose
its
candidate
by--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--it
could
have
a
convention.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
well,
it
could
choose
whatever
day
it
wished,
but
it
would
not
be...
that
would
not
be...
they
would
not
be
a
ballot-qualified
party
for
running.
they
can
choose
their
candidate
however
they
wish.
they
can
have
a
private
election.
they
can
have
a--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
and
that
is
the
point.
the
point
is
that
because,
by
becoming
part
of
the
state
structure--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--by
becoming
part
of
the
state
structure
in
the
statewide
context,
there
is
the
danger
of...
the
state
has
an
enhanced
power
to
regulate
and
to
protect
its
other
structure,
that
is
its
nonpartisan
structure,
from
parties
playing
the
role
that
they
were
designed
not
to
play.
and
that's
particularly
important,
your
honor,
because
in
local
elections,
for
example,
the
danger
of
party
domination
is
a
danger
that
was
part
of
the
experience
of
california
that
led
to
this...
led
to
this
regulation,
to
the
whole
tradition
of
nonpartisanship.
and
it
exists
for
the
reasons
that
madison
acknowledged,
and
that
is
that
in
smaller
localities
single
parties
do
tend
to
dominate,
and
there
is
a
danger
from
that
that
does
not
exist
across
broader
geographic
lines
where
there
is
a
greater
balance.
and
so
what
you
have
in
cities
like
our
city,
san
francisco,
you
have
a
one-party
majority.
and
you
have,
or
you
may
have
the
reverse
in
orange
county.
and
what
happens
is
that
if
the
state
has
enhanced
the
voice
of
these
particular
entities,
you
have
exactly
the
same
problem
that
the
people
wanted
to
avoid
when
they
enacted
the
whole
tradition
of
nonpartisanship.
and,
frankly,
that
is
what
distinguishes
this
case,
the
structure...
the
state's
structural
interest.
that
is
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
eu
case,
because
in
the
eu
case
the
structure
of
government
was
not
involved.
in
fact
when
the
government
in
the
eu
case
offered
as
an
interest,
as
a
compelling
interest,
political
stability
from
the
storer
case,
the
court's
response
was
that
the
state's
interest
in
political
stability
does
not
embrace
an
interest
in
party
stability,
in
preserving
party
unity.
we're
not
trying
to
protect
party
unity.
we're
trying
to
protect
our
nonpartisan
local
and
judicial
governments.
we're
trying
to
protect
them
from
the
danger
of
the
state's
playing
a
role,
weighing
in
on
the
side
of
the
very
parties
that
were,
that
the
people
decided
were
not
supposed
to
be
involved
in
judicial
elections,
and
were
not
supposed
to
be
involved
in
school
elections,
and
were
not
supposed
to
be
involved
in
city
and
county
elections.
that
is
the
justification,
the
structure
of
our
government.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
no,
he
is
not,
your
honor.
he
was
not
sued
in
this
case,
and
he
has
not
been
involved.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
your
honor,
he
does
have
a
duty
under
the
law
to
be
informed,
and
we
fulfilled
that
duty
by
notifying
the
attorney
general
and--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--whatever
his
reasons
for
not
taking
a
position,
whether
they
related
to
the
fact
that
he
is
a
partisan
officer
or
was
running
for
governor
of
a
party,
i
simply
cannot
say.
i
do
not
know
what
his
reasons
for
being
here
or
not
being
here
were.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
certainly.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
the
principle
basically
that
we're
advocating
here,
justice
souter,
is
really
quite
a
limited
one.
that
is
we
do
not
seek
to
prevent
endorsement
support
or
opposition
by
any
group
other
than
those
that
have
chosen
to
take
advantage
of
the
benefits
that
i
have
described.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
what
the
court
means.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
would
depend
upon
whose
political
action
committee
that
it
was.
if
it
were
the--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--well,
if
this
is,
if
what
your
honor
is
asking
is
could
the
democratic
party
form
a
pac
and
do
the
same
thing,
the
answer
to
that
is
no
because
that--
mr.
dennis
aftergut
--absolutely,
your
honor,
because
you
and
your
colleagues
are
not
the
beneficiaries
of
the
state-conferred
advantages
that
are
given
precisely
for
the
purpose
of
enhancing
your
voice.
so
what
we
are
proposing
here
is
a
limited
principle
that
applies
only
to
these
particular
groups
that
the
state
has
put
in
this
preferred
position.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
i
couldn't
have
said
it
better
myself,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
dennis
aftergut
since
i
see
my
white
light
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time,
let
me
just
summarize
by
saying
that
where
the
state-conferred
advantages
meet
the
single-party
domination
that
exists
in
so
many
localities
is
where
we
have
the
danger
of
officials
being
beholden
to
parties
at
the
sponsorship
of
the
state.
and
in
their
ordinary
experience
the
people
of
california
understood
that
it
would
be
an
absolute
fiction
to
think
that
official
party
endorsements
would
not
dismantle
their
long
heritage,
their
long
tradition
of
nonpartisanship.
thank
you.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
a
couple
of
very
quick
just
factual
points.
justice
stevens,
it
was
this
part
of
the
case
which
arose
in
the
context
of
a...
of
an
endorsement
that
was
sought
to
be
placed
inside
the
voter
pamphlet,
as
the
third
cause
of
action
states.
and
i
don't
remember
which
justice
asked
the
question
about
whether
this
was,
6(b)
was
the
only
basis
for
taking
that
endorsement
out,
but
california
elections
code
section...
now
i
seem
to
have
lost
it,
10,012,
states
that
the...
a
candidate
statement
shall
not
include
the
party
affiliation
of
the
candidate
or
membership
of
activity
in
partisan
and
political
organizations.
mr.
dennis
aftergut
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
point
that
was
made
about
the
democratic
party,
if
it
collects
1
percent
of
the
vote,
the
state
makes
the
party
remain
an
official
party,
i
submit
is
an
absurd
proposition.
if
the
party
does
not
wish
to
be
an
official
party
and
participate
in
the
primary
system,
it
can
collect
10
percent
of
the
vote,
the
state
does
not
force
it
to
participate
in
the
party
system.
there
was
a
question
about
corruption
being
the
only
justification.
corruption
has
not
been
the
only
justification
for
upholding
state
regulations
of
first
amendment
rights.
the
ballot
access
case
is
jenness,
storer,
and
so
forth,
american
party
v.
texas,
v.
white.
those
are
cases
which
deal
with
what
is
at
issue
here,
a
state's
structuring
of
its
electoral
system.
and
what
those
cases
recognize
is
that
when
the
first
amendment,
when
the
associational
rights
and
the
rights
of
political
groups
to
communicate
with
their
members,
when
the
first
amendment
interests
meet
the
practical
realities
of
structuring
a
governmental
system,
the
court
looks
at
the
structural
system
with
greater
deference
and
tends
to
uphold
those
unless
they
are
arbitrary
or
unreasonable.
and
that's
basically
what
all
of
the
arguments
of,
my
opponents
ignore
is
the
structural
interest
that
section
6(b)
serves.
and
as
an
example,
mr.
chao
says
that
it's,
he's
very
hard
pressed
to
distinguish
this
case
from
eu,
that
is
eu
doesn't
refer
to
nonpartisanship
or
partisanship.
but
if
the
court
looks
at
how
eu
justified,
how
it
rejected
the
compelling
interest
that
the
state
offered,
the
court
rejected
the
attorney
general
of
california's
reliance
on
storer
for
the
proposition
that
the
measure
there
promoted
political
stability.
the
court
said
this
measure
only
promotes
party
stability,
not
political
stability.
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
storer
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
state
may
enact
election
laws
to
mitigate
intra-party
factionalism
during
a
primary
campaign.
and
the
court
said
preserving
party
unity
during
a
primary
is
not
a
compelling
state
interest.
we're
not
trying
to
preserve
party
unity.
we're
trying
to
preserve
california's
system
of
nonpartisanship.
and
basically
the
danger
here
that
we
seek
to
avoid
is
that
parties
that
have
chosen
to
accept
state
conferred
benefits
have
an
enhanced
voice.
the
state
weighs
in.
and
particularly
where
those...
where
that
advantages
converges
in
single
party
localities,
they...
parties
can
skew
the
debate.
it's
not
that
parties
have
an
equal
voice.
parties
have
an
advantage
by
the
state.
