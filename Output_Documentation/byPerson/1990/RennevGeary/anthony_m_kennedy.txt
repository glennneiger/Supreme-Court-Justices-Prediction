justice
kennedy
you
describe
all
of
the
initial
regulations
that
you'd
recited
as
benefits.
i
take
it
parties
are
required
by
law
to
have
the
meetings
that
you
have
described;
are
they
not?
justice
kennedy
of
course
it's
required
by
law
that
they
meet
at
a
particular
time
and
place
as
designated.
so
these
aren't
just
benefits,
they're
regulations.
justice
kennedy
they
just
can't
have
a
candidate
in
the
primary.
you
can't
have
a
candidate
in
the
primary
unless
you're
an
official
political
party.
justice
kennedy
well,
you're
telling
us
that
the
parties
voluntarily
accept
all
of
these
emoluments
and
benefits
that
you
have
described.
and
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
an
official
party
must
comport
with
this
regulatory
scheme
or
it
cannot
enter
a
primary
and
it
cannot
support
a
candidate
in
any
primary.
that's
the
definition
of
a
party.
justice
kennedy
can
the
democratic
party
have
primary
elections
and
not
be
an
official
party
with
respect
to
all
of
the
regulations
that
you
have
described?
justice
kennedy
well,
that's
critical,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
you're
talking
about
general
elections,
because
for
a
primary
you
have
to
be
an
official
party.
justice
kennedy
could
you
begin
by
telling
us
how
the
case
came
up?
10
registered
voters--
justice
kennedy
--wanted
to
have
something
in
the
ballot.
can
you
tell
us
what
they
wanted
in
the
ballot?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
so
these
were
candidate
endorsements
that
a
candidate
is
permitted
by
law
to
include
in
the
ballot?
justice
kennedy
and
the
candidate
wished
to
include
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
he
or
she
had
been
endorsed
by
a
particular
party
or
central
committee?
justice
kennedy
was
there
any
finding
that
there
was
an
actual
candidate
that
wanted
to
have
this
endorsement
in
his
or
her
election?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
submission
are
you...
was
there
an
actual
submission
made?
justice
kennedy
and
i
take
it
if
a
judge
doesn't
want
to
have
an
endorsement
he'll
say
a
plague
on
all
your
houses,
i
don't
want
any
endorsements?
justice
kennedy
your
position
is
the
democratic
or
republican
party
cannot
be
prohibited
from
giving
money
to
judicial
candidates
in
california?
justice
kennedy
are
they...
i
take
it
they're
not
permitted
to
now?
justice
kennedy
well,
are
you
saying
that
there
is
no
state
interest
in
having
what
are
called
nonpartisan
offices?
justice
kennedy
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand.
so
there
is
no
governmental
interest
in
having
nonpartisan
judicial
elections?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
do
you
mean
that
california
has
an
interest
in
putting
them
on
the
ballot
on
a
nonpartisan
basis?
how
can
they
have
that
interest
if
on
the
other
hand
the
candidate
has
the
right
to
identify...
does
a,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
does
a
judicial
candidate
have
a
constitutional
right
to
identify
his
party,
say
i
am
a
republican
or
i
am
a
democrat?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
so
that's
your
submission
to
this
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
at
issue
is
a
provision
of
the
california
constitution,
article
ii
section
6(b).
it
provides
that
no
political
party
or
party’s
central
committee
may
endorse,
support,
or
oppose
a
candidate
for
non-partisan
office.
the
petitioners
are
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco,
the
local
board
of
supervisors
and
various
other
local
officials.
the
respondents
include
registered
voters
and
members
of
political
party’s
central
committees
in
san
francisco.
they
filed
suit
in
federal
court
seeking
to
have
section
6(b)
declared
invalid
as
violating
the
first
amendment.
in
particular,
they
focused
on
the
application
of
section
6(b)
in
the
context
of
voter
pamphlets
which
are
mailed
out
to
the
voters
at
public
expense.
the
respondents
challenge
the
petitioner’s
policy
of
editing
the
statements
submitted
by
candidates
for
non-partisan
office.
the
petitioners
allegedly
would
delete
from
the
candidate’s
statements
any
reference
to
an
endorsement
by
a
political
party’s
central
committee
or
by
a
member
of
such
a
committee.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court’s
ruling
that
section
6(b)
violates
the
first
amendment
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
ninth
circuit’s
decision.
having
examined
the
record,
we
conclude
in
an
opinion
filed
today
that
the
case
is
not
justiciable.
those
who
bring
suit
in
federal
court
must
demonstrate
that
the
case
is
right
for
decision
meaning
that
there
is
a
concrete
controversy
between
adverse
parties,
and
that
it
is
an
appropriate
time
for
judicial
intervention.
respondents
have
failed
to
demonstrate
a
live
controversy
right
for
resolution
by
the
federal
courts.
while
respondent
alleged
that
petitioners
have
deleted
references
to
party
endorsements
from
the
voter
pamphlets
in
the
past
and
that
they
will
do
so
in
the
future,
they
have
not
alleged
facts
showing
an
actual
or
eminent
application
of
section
6(b)
sufficient
to
present
constitutional
issues
in
clean
cut
and
concrete
form.
if
in
the
future
a
concrete
dispute
arises,
implicating
the
constitutionality
of
the
section
6(b),
respondents
are
free
to
renew
their
suit
at
that
time.
because
we
conclude
the
case
is
not
at
present
justiciable,
we
vacate
the
decision
below
and
remand
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
portion
of
respondent’s
complaint
challenging
section
6(b).
justice
scalia
joins
all
the
part
2b
of
the
court’s
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
joins.
