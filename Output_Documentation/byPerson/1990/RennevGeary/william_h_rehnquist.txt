chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-769,
renne
v.
geary.
is
that
the
way
your
client's
name
is
pronounced?
wren
or
rene,
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
rennie?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well.
chief
justice
rehnquist
some
of
them
were
candidates
who
were
being
endorsed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
we
should
address
some
of
these
questions
to
your
opponent
as
to
the
standing
of
respondents.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
there
is
a
way
for
a
political
party
to
get
on
the
ballot
without
becoming
an
official
party?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that's
by
getting
signatures?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
had
a
party...
let's
say
it's
the
surfer
party,
that
was
just
new
in
california.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it
had
100,000
members,
and
it
wanted
to,
it
did
not
want
to
go
through
the
official
party
structure.
could
it
have
a
primary
of
its
own?
supposing
there
were
two
rivals
for
the
nomination
of
that
party?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
could
have
a
convention?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
couldn't
go
into
the
primary
election
the
same
day
the
officials
parties
did?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
aftergut.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought...
so
the
prohibition
includes
county
committee
political
parties
as
well
as--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--state?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
there
any
indication
that
a
party
central
committee
wished
to
make
an
endorsement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
was
not
a
party?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
are
the
merits,
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
to
get
a
little
closer
to
home,
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
from
austin
v.
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
michigan
statute
certainly
prohibited
the
michigan
corporation
in
question
from
expressing
itself
in
an
election,
and
we
said
it
was
justified
because
the
danger
of
corruption
and
because
the
state
had
given
the
corporation
certain
benefits.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
corruption
is
the
only
evil
that
a
state
may
strike
at
under
that
rubric?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
chao,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think,
mr.
chao,
that
the
democratic
party
could
insist
that
it
be
able
to
nominate
a
candidate
for
the
county
board
of
supervisors,
or
whatever
it
is
that's
now
nonpartisan
in
san
francisco?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
you...
might
not
your
argument
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
they
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
excluded
from
competition
for
that
office?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
i
would
be
interested
in
your
answer
to
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chao.
mr.
aftergut,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
aftergut.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-769
renne
against
geary
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
