justice
white
but
what
kind
of...
how
did
this
case
get
started?
these...
you
say
these
respondents
wanted
to
put
their...
wanted
to
recite
in
these
pamphlets
that
there
had
been
endorsements?
justice
white
and
who...
and
then
somebody
refused?
justice
white
who
refused?
justice
white
refused--
justice
white
--to
put
them
in.
and
then
the...
and
then
they
sued,
the
other
people
sued?
is
that
it?
justice
white
because
they
wanted
to
get
these
endorsements
in
the
pamphlets.
justice
white
and
the
grounds
for
refusing
by
the
official
was
that
the
state
law
forbade
endorsements?
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
but
getting
it...
they
can
get
their
candidate
on
the
ballot,
but
it
won't
say
that
that
candidate
is
a
candidate
of
that
particular
party,
will
it?
justice
white
well,
anybody
can
get
on
the
party...
get
on
the
ballot
without
a,
if
they
get
the
number
of
signatures.
justice
white
so
a
political
party
doesn't
get
on
the
ballot,
somebody
they
want
on
the
ballot
gets
on
the
ballot.
but
the
name
of
the
party
won't
be
there,
will
it?
justice
white
is
the
state
attorney
general
involved
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
white
but
this
is
a
provision
of
the
california
constitution?
justice
white
and
he
doesn't
have
any
right
or
duty
to
be
informed
about
when
some
constitutional
provision
is
at
issue?
justice
white
but
he
never
took
any
position
in
the
case?
justice
white
thank
you.
mr.
aftergut,
are
you
going
to
turn
from
the
question
of
the
state's
interest
to
the
problem
of
inclusiveness
before
you
are
done?
justice
white
it's
practiced
by
the
official
party,
isn't
it?
i
don't
suppose...
are
the
officers
of
the
party
forbidden
to
go
out
and
campaign?
justice
white
are
they
or
not?
justice
white
but
then,
any
organization
besides
the
party
can
support
these
candidates,
i
suppose,
in
these
nonpartisan
elections,
like
the
california
democratic
council?
justice
white
that's
not
an
official
party,
but--
justice
white
--so
all
organizations
other
than
these
officially
recognized
parties
can
campaign,
endorse,
and
give
money?
justice
white
xxx
offset
in
either
way?
justice
white
so
you
don't
think
your
argument...
don't
you
think
your
argument
here
bears
on
that
issue,
though?
justice
white
and
to
contribute
money?
justice
white
and
this
could
go
for
retention
elections,
which
are
the
only
kind
of
elections
there
are,
i
guess?
justice
white
okay.
