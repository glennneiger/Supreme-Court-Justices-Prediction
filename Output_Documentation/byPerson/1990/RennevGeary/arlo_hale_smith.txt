mr.
arlo
hale
smith
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court:
i
think
i'd
like
to
start
by
saying
that
i
think
mr.
aftergut
overstates
the
amount
of
quote,
choice,
unquote
under
california
law
any
party
has
on
being
on
the
ballot.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
okay.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
here's
what
happened.
basically
there
were
10
registered
voters,
some
of
them
county
central
committee
members.
the
dispute
was
with
the
san
francisco
registrar
of
voters,
who
categorically
took
the
position
that
they
would
not
print
any
statement
by
any
candidate
indicating
a
party
endorsement
under
any
circumstance.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
basically,
your
honor,
that's,
that's
what
the
dispute
was
about.
however,
there
was
not
an
actual
statement
that
had
been
rejected.
the
registrar
had
in
advance
just
taken--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--no.
but
the
registrar
had
in
advance
said--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--and
county
committee
members.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
yes.
a
number
of
these
were
county
central
committee
members
who
were...
county
central
committee
members.
and--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--county
central
committee
members
would...
are
by
this
measure
prohibited
from,
as
committee
members,
voting
to
have
their
committee
make
endorsements
which
the
candidates
could
then
include.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
it
includes
state
and
county
committees.
it
says...
what
it
literally
says
is
no
political
party
or
party
central
committee
may
endorse,
support,
or
oppose
a
candidate
for
a
nonpartisan
office.
and
then...
nonpartisan
office
is
defined
as
local,
school,
or
judicial
office.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
no.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
yes.
yes,
the
republican
committee
of
san
francisco
said
it
would
intervene
if
the
district
court
judge
found
that
necessary
to
confer
standing.
and
the--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--no.
the
chairman
was
a
party.
the
chairman
was...
the
chairman
was
party
to
the
action.
and
the
chairman
and
some
officers
of
the...
of
both
county,
both
the
democratic
and
republican
committees
were
parties
to
this
action.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
as
long
as
reference
is
made
to
ballot
measures,
any
registered
voter
in
san
francisco
could,
if
they
pay
the
price,
include
something.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
that's
right.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
you
find
in
the
san
francisco
administrative
code...
you
find
in
the
san
francisco
administrative
code,
san
francisco
charter
of
provisions,
for
candidate
statements
and
for
ballot
arguments.
and
this
case
involved
both
candidate
statements
and
ballot
arguments.
the
san
francisco
registrar
took
the
position
that
they
would
never
accept
any
candidate
statement,
period,
if
it
had
any
party
endorsement.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
are
you
talking
about
in
official
election
material,
or
are
you
talking
about
generally?
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
your
honor,
that
might
be
a...
if
it
was
a
forum-specific
regulation
that
might
be
a
different
problem.
but
this--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--well,
i'm
not
so
sure
if
it
is,
and
indeed
the
california
court
of
appeal
recently
in
a
case
called
clark
v.
burleigh
in
a
matter
involving
what
judicial
candidates
could
say,
actually
invalidated
an
election
code
provision
that
limited
what
judicial
candidates
could
say
in
their
candidate
statements.
but
whether
that's--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--no.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
the
only
reason
was
the
state
constitutional
provision.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
that's
right.
and
the
respondent...
the
petitioner
has
never
argued
otherwise
any
points.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
they
have
never
asserted
any
other
basis.
indeed
on
this
point
they,
both
sides
have
agreed
the
whole
time
that--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--no.
basically
the
registrar
just,
when
asked,
said
that
they
would
follow
article
ii,
section
6(b),
would
not
allow
any
candidates
to
print
any
such
endorsements.
and
the
parties
wanted
to
make
endorsements
and
have
the
candidates
go
use
the
endorsements
in
their
candidate
statements.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
your
honor,
on
the
merits,
i
think
it's
hard
to
envision
a
more
flagrant
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
basically,
under
this
law
voters
in
california
have
less
rights
than
voters
in
the
soviet
union
in
the
sense
that
the
soviet
union,
you
know,
you
have
multiple-candidate
elections
which
are
not
by
party,
to
the
extent
they
are
now
allowing
multiple-candidate
elections.
yet
i
am
sure
that
if
gorbachev
announced
tomorrow
that
the
lithuanian
nationalists
or
the
georgia
nationalists
could
not
endorse
candidates,
that
president
bush
and
jim
baker
would
be
rightly
protesting
a
violation
of
civil
rights.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
how
do
i
distinguish
it?
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
easily.
in
austin
the
problem
was
that...
there's
two
big
things.
one
branch
is
that
in
austin
the
prohibition
wasn't
as
broad.
basically
the
corporation
could
set
up
a
totally
controlled
pac,
and...
to
make
contributions,
and
the
corporation
could
make
any
endorsement
it
wanted.
the
corporation
could
send
to
its
shareholders
or
members
any
expression
it
wanted
on
candidates.
it
simply...
in
this
case
the
political
party
cannot--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--well,
i
said
there
are
two
distinctions,
though.
one
is
that
the
michigan
statute
didn't
go
nearly
as
far
as
this
provision
does,
because
this
is
an
absolute
prohibition
and
this
court's
opinion,
as
well
as
concurrence
by
justice
brennan,
were
very
explicit
that
they
were
saying
it
was
not
an
absolute
prohibition,
because
the
michigan
corporation
could
set
up
a
wholly
controlled
pac.
the
michigan
corporation
could,
to
its
members,
send
any
endorsement
it
wanted.
and
the
michigan
corporation
could
endorse
all
it
wanted,
it
just
was
limited
in
direct
expenditure
money
from
the
corporate
treasury.
the
second
point
is
what
austin
and
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
make
very
clear
is
that
the
problem
was
not
that
the
corporation
got
benefits,
because
there
would
not
be
necessity
to
exempt
any
corporations,
including
wholly
political
corporations.
it
was
just
mere
receipt
of
benefits
does
it.
the
test
was
that
it
gave
corporations
advantage
in
the
economic
marketplace
which
would
allow
them
to
basically
bring
money
over
into
the
political
marketplace.
and
that
was
the
quote,
corruption,
unquote,
that
the
court
was
concerned
about.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
i
think
corruption
is
the
only
one
that
has
been
recognized
as
legitimate
so
far,
and
i
think
that
this
provision
is
just
so
all
encompassing.
it's...
it
applies
to
all
parties,
major
or
minor,
ballot
qualified
or
nonballot
qualified.
it
applies
to
all
advocacy
with
respect
to
local,
school,
and
judicial
races
whatsoever.
the
political
parties--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--well,
even
if
they're
not--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--i
believe
individually
they
could
campaign,
but--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--yeah,
but
that--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--that's
true.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
that's
right.
and
that
actually,
though,
underpoints
the
whole
irrationality
of
the
enactment.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
state
might
have
greater
ability
to
regulate
the
political
activities
of
judges
or
judicial
candidates
than
they
could
of
the
outside
entities.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
parties
are
part
of
the
governmental
process
only
insofar
as
they
are
allowed
to
make
nominations
for
certain
offices.
and
basically
the,
what...
there
is
no
choice.
if
you
have
1
percent
of
the
registration
you
are
automatically
a
qualified
party
in
california,
period.
all
it
takes
is
1
percent
of
the
registration.
you
know,
there's
no,
i
don't
even
think
there's
a
legal
way
that
the
democratic
or
republican
party
could,
quote,
withdraw,
unquote,
from,
quote,
accepting,
unquote,
the
benefits
that
the
petitioners
talked
about.
because
basically
the
test
under
california
law
is
if
you
have
1
percent
you're
a
ballot-qualified
party.
and
the
test
also
is,
and
with
respect
to
a
question
that
was
asked
earlier,
under
california
law
independent
candidates
cannot
use
any
party
designation.
in
a
case
called
libertarian
party
v.
eu,
the
california
supreme
court
squarely
held
that
about
10
years
ago.
so
basically,
if
you
get
1
percent
registration
you
are
on
the
ballot
as
a
party
that
nominates
by
primary.
you
must
nominate
by
primary
under
the
california
constitution.
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
as
soon
as
1
percent
of
the
voters
register
say
that
i
want...
i
am
affiliated
with
this
party
or
that
party,
as
soon
as
1
percent
of
the
voters
register
a
certain
way,
the
party--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--under
california
law
you
have
to
actually...
under
california
law
you
have
to
fill
out
a
voter
registration
card
that
says
i
affiliate
with
this
party
or
that
party
or--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--no,
they
have
no
choice.
if
1
percent
of
the
voters
sign
up--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--if--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--all
i
am
telling
you
is
that
once
there
is
1
percent
the
party
is
on
the
ballot
and
is
in
the
scheme.
and
in
fact
once
they're
on,
even
if
they
fall
below
1
percent,
as
long
as
they
don't
fall
below
something
like
one-fifteenth
of
a
percent
and
they
get
at
least
1
percent
in
some
statewide
election,
they
stay
qualified
under
the
scheme.
and
that's
how
it
works
in
california.
so
there
isn't
this
great
choice,
and
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
that's
just
resuscitation
of
the
old
argument
that
if
something's
a
privilege
then
you
can
condition
speech
on
it.
and
i
think
this
court
has
in
most
contexts
reject
that...
rejected
that
argument
rather
squarely.
because
by
the
same
argument,
i
guess,
anyone
who
got
a...
you
know,
you
have
federal
law
saying
anyone
who
got
a
patent
couldn't
support
any
candidate
for
any
federal
office.
or
anyone
who
got
a
student
loan
couldn't
be
involved
in
any
public
political
activities.
so
i
don't
think--
mr.
arlo
hale
smith
--well,
i
believe
that
naturally,
if
you
look
at
the
cases
coming
after
that,
like
connick,
it's
clear
that
the
rationale
is
the
government
has...
that
the
government
is
supposed
to
have
the
same
kind
of
control
over
its
employees
that
a
private
employer
might.
and
obviously
the
employment
relation
implies
a
certain
degree
of
control
that
i
think
contributing
or
supporting
a
political
organization
doesn't.
and
mclf
is
an
authority
on
that,
that
a
contributor
or
supporter
can't
expect
to
control
a
lot
of
the
workings
of
the
political
organization.
