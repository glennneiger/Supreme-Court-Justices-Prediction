mr.
cedric
c.
chao
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
of
the
first
indications
that
democracy
was
arriving
in
eastern
europe
last
year
was
the
formation
of
political
parties.
as
the
ninth
circuit
noted
in
its
eu
decision,
political
parties
are
nothing
more
than
voluntary
associations
of
individuals
who
band
together
in
pursuit
of
shared
political
goals.
political
parties
can
succeed
in
the
political
marketplace
only
if
their
vision
of
society
attracts
a
majority
of
the
population.
and
that
is
why
this
boogie-man
of
the
party
dominance
makes
no
sense.
if
voters
like
the
message
and
they
accept
the
message,
then
they
will
accept
the
candidates
of
that
particular
party
and
the
programs
of
that
particular
party.
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
section
6(b)--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--well,
under
the
nonpartisan
nomination
process
the
answer
is
no.
they
do
not
have,
they
do
not
control
access
to
the
ballot.
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
well,
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
i
think
that
would
be
difficult
to
say,
your
honor.
i
do
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
say.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--either
way,
your
honor.
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
i
don't
believe
directly
so,
and
i
don't
think
we're
taking
it
that
far,
your
honor.
i
think
what
is
at
issue
squarely
in
this
case
is
whether,
given
the
fact
that
there
are
elections,
whether
they
be
partisan
or
nonpartisan,
where
the
political
parties
have
an
equal
right
to
every
other
entity
and
individual
in
society
to
speak
their
piece,
to
say
this
candidate
is
qualified,
this
candidate
is
worthy
of
your
support,
and
that's
really
what's
before
us.
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
as
well
as
contribute
money,
support
and
oppose.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
that
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--that
is
in
a
different
portion
of
this
lawsuit.
that's
correct.
section
6(b)--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
under
the
present...
that's
correct.
section
6(b)
is--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--under
section
6(b)
they
are
not
permitted,
that
is
correct.
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
that
is
correct,
with
the
exception,
your
honor,
that
for
certain
of
our
trial
courts
a
challenger
can
take
on
an
incumbent
judge--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--and
in
fact
that
did
happen
in
november
1990.
section
6(b)
is
quite
dangerous.
in
california
there
are
19,279
elective
offices.
of
those
offices,
only
179
are
partisan.
what
section
6(b)
then
does
is
it
says
that
political
parties
may
be
silenced
on
the
issue
of
political
candidates
in
over
99
percent
of
elective
offices
in
california,
which
goes
to
one
of
the
major
reasons
for
the
existence
of
political
parties,
namely
the
ability
to
evaluate
candidates
for
public
office
and
to
decide
whether
they
are
worthy
of
support
or
not.
section
6(b)
is
equally
an
egregious
burden
on
the
right
of
the
voters
and
of
party
members
to
receive
information
in
elections.
and,
as
this
court
has
held
repeatedly,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
first
amendments
in
the
political
marketplace
is
to
ensure
that
voters
receive
as
much
information
as
possible
in
order
to
intelligently
exercise
the
right
of
franchise.
just
two
terms
ago--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--the
statute
reads
not
only
endorse,
your
honor,
but
also
support
and
oppose.
and
i
do
not
quarrel
with
my
opponent's
interpretation
of
support
to--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--we
do
not
quarrel
with
that
interpretation,
your
honor,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
the
statute
is,
the
burden
of
the
statute
is
very,
very
broad.
the...
just
two
terms
ago
in
eu,
it
was
held
that
the
first
amendment
protects
the
rights
of
political
parties
to
endorse
candidates
to
speak
on
candidates
running
in
party
primaries.
i
submit
that
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
rationale
of
eu
does
not
apply
with
equal
force
to
nonpartisan
elections.
i
would
like
to
address...
i
think
there
is
a
very
fundamental
misconception,
a
very
fundamental
confusion
in
the
compelling
argument
put
forth
by
the
petitioner.
their
primary
compelling
interest,
they
assert,
is
the
impartial
administration
of
government,
and
they
found
that
on
the
letter
carriers
decision.
but
i
submit
that
he
is...
that
petitioner
has
confused
two
very
distinct
concepts.
on
the
one
hand,
as
letter
carriers
spoke,
there
is
an
interest
in
the
impartial
execution
of
the
laws,
which
meant
the
execution
and
enforcement
of
laws
without
bias
or
favoritism
toward
any
party
or
member.
in
a
local
context
that
would
mean
whether
i
supported
the
winning
or
losing
candidate
for
mayor,
i
have
an
equal
expectation
that
my
garbage
will
be
picked
up
once
a
week
just
like
everybody
else.
the
concept
that
they
tried
to
throw
in
to
bring
into
letter
carriers
rationale
is
impartial
policy
making.
they
would
have...
they
argue
that
there's
only
one
right
way
to
run
a
city
or
a
county.
and
they
also
argue
that
parties,
based
on
evidence
of
100
years
ago,
are
these
engines
of
evil,
and
therefore
parties
are
driven
to
pressure
the
local
official
to
act
in
a
way
to
decide
a
policy
that
is
not
the
right
way.
i
submit
that
their
syllogism
is
fatally
incorrect.
there
is
not
one
right
way
to
run
a
city
or
a
county.
there
are
many
ways
to
run
a
county--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--there
is
no
compelling
interest
in
having
a
nonpartisan
office.
a
nonpartisan,
the
nonpartisan
method
of
putting
candidates
on
the
ballot
is
merely
one
vehicle.
they...
california
has
chosen
on
a
nonpartisan
nomination
process.
other
states
have
done
that
and
other
states
have
chosen
a
partisan
method
of
putting
both
judicial
office
holders
and
other
office
holders
on
the
ballots.
nonpartisanship--
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
--i
would
submit
that
is
correct.
there
is...
california
is
free
to
determine
that
we
will
put
judges
on
the
ballot
on
a
nonpartisan
basis.
but
i
would
submit
that
the
nonpartisan
election
by
its,
in
and
of
itself,
is
not
a
compelling
interest
in
the
first
amendment
structure.
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
on
the
ballot,
your
honor?
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
i
would,
i
would
say
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
cedric
c.
chao
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
could
return
to
letter
carriers
for
just
a
short
minute,
los
angeles
county
has
a
population
of
approaching
9
million
people.
it
is
larger
than
the
population,
it
has
a
population
larger
than
that
of
42
other
states
in
this
country.
the
leaders
of
los
angeles
county
and
all
the
other
cities
and
counties
of
this,
of
our
state,
face
very
controversial,
very
difficult
policy
choices
every
day.
and
there
is
no
one
right
way
to
make
those
choices.
the
elections
of
the
leaders
of
these
cities
and
counties
necessarily
will
involve
discussions
about
both
the
voters'
views
and
the
candidates'
views
of
these
policy
choices.
it
is
expected,
the
voters
expect
that
there
will
be
discussions,
or
how
else
will
they
make
a
decision
on
who
to,
with
respect
to
who
to
vote
for.
in
these
discussions
political
parties
historically
in
our
country
have
played
a
very
important
role,
and
we
submit
that
section
6(b),
by
taking
away
that
role,
does
great
disservice
to
the
first
amendments.
petitioner
ignores
the
fact
that
in
brown
v.
hartlage
it
was
recognized
that
candidate
commitments
enhance
the
accountability
of
government
officials
to
the
people
that
they
represent,
and
assist
the
voters
in
predicting
the
effect
of
that
votes.
this
court
also
held
in
brown
v.
hartlage
that
some
promises
are
universally
acknowledged
as
legitimate,
indeed
indispensable
to
decision
making
in
a
democracy.
if
in
my
remaining
time
i
could
speak
very
briefly
to
the
issue
of
judicial
elections,
states
throughout
our
nation
employ
many
different
methods
of
selecting
and
retaining
judges.
every
method
has
its
advantages,
and
of
course
plenty
disadvantages.
california
has
opted
for
a
system
where
we
have
retention
elections,
and
in
some
cases
contested
elections.
the
necessary
result
of
that
selection
is
that
there
will
be
discussion
about
judges,
discussion
of
their
records,
discussion
of
their
qualifications.
the
asserted
threat
to
judicial
independence,
of
which
petitioners
speak
of,
is
attributable
not
to
the
fact
that
political
parties
may
participate
in
that
process,
but
rather
to
the
underlying
decision
to
subject
judges
to
elections
in
the
first
place.
perhaps
the
most
dramatic
episode
of
the
asserted
threat
to
judicial
independence
was
in
1986
retention
elections
in
which
three
justices
of
our
supreme
court
were
defeated.
$7
million
were
raised
by
various
special
interest
groups
to
defeat
those
justices,
and
it
was,
there
were
commercials,
there
were
discussions
focused
on
their
views
on
the
record,
and
specifically
on
the
death
penalty.
voters
cast
those
three
justices
out
of
office
and,
as
justice
groton
wrote
in
adjudicature
article,
the
polls
indicated
that
the
basis
for
casting
those
three
justices
out
was
not
integrity
or
competence,
but
rather
their
death
penalty
position.
i
raise
this
issue
because
political
parties
in
1986
did
not
play
a
role
in
those
elections,
and
that
illustrates
the
gross
under-inclusiveness
of
this
statute.
petitioner
also
ignores
the
fact
that
both
bridges
v.
california
and
craig
v.
harney
teach
that
we
should
presume
that
judges
are
able
to
withstand
criticism
and
are
able
to
withstand
pressures
in
elections.
even
the
california
judges'
association,
which
adopted
the
california
judicial
code,
has
the
same
presumption.
in
the
judicial
code
it
states,
and
i
quote,
"judges
should
be
unswayed
by
partisan
interests,
public
clamor,
or
fear
of
criticism.
"
end
quotes.
i
submit
that
to
assume
that
judges
are
not
persons
of
fortitude,
able
and
willing
to
withstand
the
pressure
of
the
electoral
marketplace,
is
to
do
them
a
great
disservice.
in
closing
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
first
amendment
jurisprudence
teaches
us
that
the
free
flow
of
information,
particularly
with
respect
to
candidacies,
particularly
with
respect
to
governmental
affairs,
is
essential
to
our
democracy
and
must
be
protected.
i
submit
that
it
would
be
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
to
silence
political
parties
on
the
very
issue
that
they
were
formed
to
address.
i
would
request
that
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
