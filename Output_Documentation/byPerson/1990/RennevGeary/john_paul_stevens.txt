justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
the
california
constitutional
provision
had
been
written
in
a
different
way
and
simply
said
that
the
statements
sent
out
by
the
candidate
shall
not
include
any
party
endorsements
that
might
be
made,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
stevens
official
election
material,
which
is
what
i
gather
gave
rise
to
this
controversy.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
perhaps
even
though
on
its
face
the
california
provision
may
be
overly
broad
and
unconstitutional.
maybe
as
applied
to
the
specific
controversy
here
it's
a
perfectly
proper
thing.
justice
stevens
but
it
didn't
invalidate
the
provision
prohibiting
them
from
announcing
a
party
endorsement
in
their
candidate
statement,
did
it?
justice
stevens
which
is...
well--
--mr.
smith,
is
at
least
this
clear
on
the
standing
point,
that
the
only
reason
the
registrar
gave,
even
though
there
may
have
been...
may
have
been
other
reasons
why
he
might
have
rejected
the
submissions
for
the--
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
the
state
could
prohibit
the
candidate
from
including
that
endorsement
in
the
statement
that's
sent
out
to
voters
at
public
expense?
justice
stevens
well,
it's
what
gave
rise
to
the
lawsuit,
though.
justice
stevens
and
that
provision
is
not
challenged
in
this
case?
