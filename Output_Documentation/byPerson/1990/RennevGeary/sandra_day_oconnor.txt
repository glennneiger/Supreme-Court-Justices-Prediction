justice
o'connor
would
you
mind
inserting
another
little
item,
which
is
to
tell
us
how
this
case
arises?
now,
the
respondents
are
not
political
parties
in
the
state
of
california,
are
they?
they're
voters?
justice
o'connor
and
so
how
do
we
address
the
question
in
that
light?
is
it
an
overbreadth
argument
of
some
kind?
i
mean,
6(b)
is
addressed
to
political
parties,
i
thought.
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
and
we
don't
have
a
political
party
here.
justice
o'connor
yes.
and
so
how
is
it
that
we
even
get
to
the
question?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
does
6(b)
operate?
now,
for
example
if
there
were
a
general
election
coming
up
and
there
were
some
judicial
candidates
on
the
ballot,
listed
on
the
ballot
as
nonpartisan,
i
take
it
that
this
provision
6(b)
might
be
said
to
prohibit,
let's
say,
the
democratic
party
from
preparing
a
little
card
to
give
to
registered
democrats
by
the
precinct
committeeman
saying
these
judicial
candidates
are
candidates
that
we
think
merit
your
support.
take
this
with
you
to
the
ballot
on
election
day.
justice
o'connor
you
could
enjoin
the
distribution
of
a
communication?
justice
o'connor
that's
the
position
you
take?
justice
o'connor
but
you
can
suppress
the
speech?
justice
o'connor
the
political
speech.
justice
o'connor
and
how
is
it
you
think
the
first
amendment
would
allow
that?
justice
o'connor
there
are
other
states
that
have
nonpartisan
judicial
elections,
and
they
don't
purport
to
prevent
speech
by
political
parties.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
the
state
in
first
amendment
analysis
can
just
offer
additional
benefits
as
a
sort
of
quid
pro
quo
for
giving
up
first
amendment
rights?
justice
o'connor
no
candidate
had
come
forward
and
said
include
this
endorsement?
justice
o'connor
and
no
political
party
had
come
forward
and
said
include
this
endorsement?
these
are
registered
voters
who
went
in
and
said
we
think
you
should
include
them--
justice
o'connor
--did
they
have
any
right
to--
justice
o'connor
--to
demand
that
certain
materials
be
included?
justice
o'connor
can
an--
--how
did
that
give
them
any
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
this
isn't
a
ballot
measure.
it's
a
political
candidacy
we're
talking
about.
justice
o'connor
so
can
any
citizen
come
forward
and
demand
that
things
be
included
in
the
pamphlet
concerning
a
candidate?
and
if
so,
where
in
the
record
do
we
find
that
regulation
or
provision?
