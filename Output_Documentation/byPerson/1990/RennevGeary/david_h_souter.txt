there's
no
limitation
on
pac's
and
so
on,
for
example,
from
coming
out
and
endorsing
and
working
for
candidates?
justice
souter
can
a
political
action
committee
do
the
things
which
the
party
organization
itself
may
not
do?
justice
souter
well,
what's
the...
what's
the
standard
by
which
you
determine
that?
justice
souter
well,
could
i
form
a
pac
of
democratic
surfers
and
support
a
candidate?
justice
souter
so
you're
just
saying
that
the
only
pac
that
cannot
support
is
one
that
would
be
sort
of
an
obvious
or
blatant
alter-ego
for
the
party
itself?
justice
souter
okay.
