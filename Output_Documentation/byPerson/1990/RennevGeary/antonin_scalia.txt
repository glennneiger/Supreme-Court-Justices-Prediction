justice
scalia
mr.
aftergut,
could
you
tell
me,
this
constitutional
provision
which
says
that
no
political
party
may
endorse,
support,
or
oppose
a
candidate
for
nonpartisan
office,
does...
would
that
prevent
a
political
party
from
contributing
money
for
the
candidate
to
promote
himself?
in
other
words,
is
it
only
addressed
to
an
endorsement?
could
the
republican
party
support
the
candidate
so
long
as
it
did
not
say
that
he
is
the
republican-endorsed
candidate?
justice
scalia
it
could
not?
it
cannot
contribute
money
or
do
anything
else
to
assist
his
campaign?
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean
send
it
free
of
charge?
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
scalia
the
state
pays
the
postage.
justice
scalia
prohibits
partisan
nomination.
justice
scalia
but
the
state
runs
and
pays
for
the
primaries
of
the
validated
parties?
justice
scalia
correct?
and
it
mails
out
information
to
all
the
voters
about
those
parties.
justice
scalia
and
it
lists
those
names
on
the
ballot.
justice
scalia
so
that
in
a
sense
those
parties
become
part
of
the
governmental
process
of
election.
justice
scalia
it's
part
of
the
formal
election
system
of
california,
that
parties...
part
of
the
election
is
you
have
a
party
primary
and
then
the
formal
election
with
the
party
names
on
it.
justice
scalia
so
it's
accepting
the
benefits.
it's
becoming
part
of
the
state
electoral
structure.
justice
scalia
i
see
how
that
would
give
them
an
interest
in
whether
the
law
is
valid
or
not,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
gave
them
an
interest
in
the
act
that
forms
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit.
does
anyone
except
the
candidate
have
the
right
to
demand
that
something
be
included--
justice
scalia
--in
this
mailing?
justice
scalia
who
has
the
right
to
include
it?
justice
scalia
--that's
the
only
reason
he
gave?
justice
scalia
and
as
far
as
we
know
there
is
no
other
basis?
there
may
be
other
bases,
but
we're
not
sure?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
the
state
of
california
could
prohibit
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
from
endorsing
as
a
group
a
candidate
for
governor,
one
candidate
or
another?
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
because
they
are
part
of
the
governmental
process?
and
aren't
parties
part
of
the
governmental
process,
as
california
has
set
it
up?
justice
scalia
1
percent
registration
in
what?
i
don't
understand.
you
register
in
the
primaries,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
do
they
have
to
honestly
say
whether
they
are
affiliated
with
one
party
or
another?
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
i
think
it's...
isn't
it
up
to
the
party
whether
they
want
to
be
a
primary
party
or
not,
whether
they
want
to
play
the
primary
game
and
get
on
the
ballot?
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
they
just
tell
their
members,
don't
sign
up.
this
party
does
not
want
to
be
on
the
primary
ballot.
we
don't
want
to
be
a
primary
party.
couldn't
they
do
that,
and
tell
their
voters
don't
affiliate
for
purposes
of
this
registration?
can't
they?
are
you
sure
that
they
must
say
i--
justice
scalia
--all
right,
you've
got
me,
i'll
tell
the
truth.
i
really
am
a
member
of
the...
whatever...
the
surfers'
party.
you
have
to
say
that?
justice
scalia
we
have
rejected
it
in
most
contexts.
the
question
is
whether
this
is
one
of
those
in
which
we
should
reject
it.
we
haven't
rejected
it
in
all.
we
have
upheld
the
hatch
act,
for
example.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
on
the
information
point,
do
you
agree
with
the
answer
that
your
opponent
gave
with
regard
to
what
is
prohibited
by
this
law?
that
is
to
say
the
political
party
is
not
only
prohibited
from
saying
the
republican
party
endorses
so
and
so,
but
it
cannot
even
put
out
a
brochure
at
its
expense
describing
what
a
terrific
candidate
this
is?
it
cannot
even
spend
any
money
to
circulate
information
on
this
person's
behalf,
information
apart
from
the
party
endorsement?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
mean
officially
support
necessarily?
it
means
contribute
anything
to
his
support?
