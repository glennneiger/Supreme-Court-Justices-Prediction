mr.--
--suppose...
go
on.
mr.
evans,
the
thing
that
makes
the
tax
burdensome
is
the
tax
on
the
domiciliary,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
you
are
not
a
domiciliary.
justice
stevens
and
the--
justice
stevens
--but
just
focusing
on
this
for
a
moment,
if
they,
if
they
collected...
what...
would
it
not
be
complete
relief
here
to
say
they
cannot
collect
taxes
from
domiciliaries
except
to
the
extent
that
the
debts
have
a
situs
in
florida?
justice
stevens
and
do
you
have
standing
to
insist
that
that
be
done?
justice
stevens
are
you
prejudiced
at
all
by
the
fact
that
domiciliaries
may
pay
more
taxes
than
you
do?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
are
you
prejudiced
at
all
by
the
fact
that
florida
domiciliaries
may
pay
a
higher
tax
than
you
do?
that's
the
discrimination
caused
by
this
tax.
justice
stevens
well,
but
you
are
not
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
florida
domiciliaries
must
pay
a
higher
tax
than
you
do,
theoretically,
are
you?
justice
stevens
you're
hurt
by
the
possibility
you
might
be
taxed
in
michigan
as
a
domiciliary.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand.
your
intrastate
competitors
are
paying
taxes
on
the
same
accounts
receivable,
aren't
they?
justice
stevens
but
the
tax
is
just
the
same
as
your
tax.
justice
stevens
--mr.
evans,
can
we
go
back
to
the
armco
case?
you
responded
to
me
before
by
saying
this
is
really
just
like
armco,
but
in
armco
the
taxpayer
was
paying
a
wholesale
tax,
the
ohio
company,
that
its
west
virginia
manufacturing
competitors
did
not
have
to
pay.
justice
stevens
that's
not
like
this.
justice
stevens
what
of...
which
one
of
your
competitors
does
not
have
to
pay
a
tax
you
have
to
pay?
justice
stevens
but
it...
doesn't
it
pay
the...
doesn't
it
pay
a
tax
at
the
same
rate
on
all
its
commercial
paper
the
way
you
do?
it's...
may
be
given
a
different
label,
but
isn't
it
paying...
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
how
it
can
possibly
be,
have
an
advantage
over
you,
unless
you
look
at
the
possibility
of
a
tax
against
you
in
michigan.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
one
was
paying
on
manufacture,
and
the
other
was
paying
on
wholesale
receipts.
but
here
they
are
both
paying
on
the
value
of
the
intangible
paper.
justice
stevens
which
has
a
situs
in
florida.
justice
stevens
well,
but
the
tax...
the
intangibles
being
taxed
are
the
same,
aren't
they?
and
from
a
competitive
market
standpoint--
justice
stevens
--yeah.
justice
stevens
but
in
the...
but
in
this
case
your
concern
would
be
satisfied
if
there
was
an
injunction
by
the
district
court
in
effect
saying
do
not
levy
this
tax
or
a
comparable
tax
against
domiciliaries
to
the
extent
they
have
out-of-state
business.
you
see,
the
thing
that
differs,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
you
identify
could
completely
solved
without
saving
you
a
nickel...
in
short.
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
not
sure.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
farr,
why
can't
we
do
that
with
companies,
like
in
armco,
that
have
only
one
manufacturing
plant?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
most
taxpayers
don't
have
plants
in
49
states,
and
if
you
look
at
the
general
run
of
florida
out-of-state
companies,
presumably
there
is
one
from
each
of
the
49
other
states.
so
that
to
really
survey
the
tax
you
would
have
to
look
at
all
the
home
states,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stevens
you
can
do
it
for
each
one,
one
at
a
time.
justice
stevens
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
domiciliary
state
would
be
michigan
and
not
delaware?
justice
stevens
except
it
makes
it
two
you
have
to
look
at
instead
of
one.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
mr.
farr,
can
i
suggest
a
problem
with
your
approach?
supposing
this
challenge
had
been
brought
not
by
ford
challenging
the
situs
aspect
of
the
tax,
but
by
a
florida
domiciliary,
making
precisely
the
same
argument?
and
they
would
say
we
are
subject
to
a
situs...
potential
situs
tax
in
49
other
states
because
we
are
a
nationwide
credit
company.
would
you
say
they
didn't...
would
you
make
the
same
argument
to
them?
justice
stevens
i
see.
it's
the
fact
that
the
hypothetical
tax
is
the
burden
on
the
domiciliary
that
is
what
you--
justice
stevens
--mr.
farr,
are
there
any
florida
cases
pending
in
which
a
florida
domiciliary
has
challenged
this
tax?
justice
stevens
let
me,
let
me
ask
you,
supposing
we're
talking
about
tangibles
instead
of
intangibles--
justice
stevens
--talking
about
real
estate.
could
a
florida
resident
be
taxed
on
real
estate
owned
in
illinois
or
michigan?
justice
stevens
he
could
not?
justice
stevens
by
florida.
justice
stevens
it
could
not
be
taxed
on
its
out-of-state
wealth.
