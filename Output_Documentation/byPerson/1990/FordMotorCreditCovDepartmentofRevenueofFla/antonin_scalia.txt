justice
scalia
well,
i'd
like
to
understand
it
without
reference
to
precedents,
is
just
how
this
whole
thing
hurts
you.
i
just
don't
see
it.
justice
scalia
that
you
might
be
taxed
in
michigan
as
a
domiciliary.
justice
scalia
that's
the
whole
case,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
the
problem
is
that
the
whole,
the
whole
internal
consistency
test
is
based
upon
prospective
damage
and
not
actual
damage,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
because
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
are
actually
being
taxed
twice,
it's
the
theoretical
possibility
of
your
being
taxed
twice
that
causes
us
to
apply
the
test.
justice
scalia
so
it's
sort
of
hard
to
get
upset
about
potentiality
as
a
basis
for
standing,
if
you
are
going
to
apply
that
kind
of
a
test.
justice
scalia
well,
it
wasn't
until
the
last
decade
that
we
somehow
found
it
necessary
to
explicitly
adopt
it
in
order
to
prevent
all
of
these
horribles.
justice
scalia
somehow
we
stumbled
along
for
190
years
without...
without
this
great
disaster.
justice
scalia
you
cited
a
few
cases
in
which
we
had
language
that
could
be
interpreted
to
be
the
internal
consistencies
test,
but
failed
to
cite
dozens
of
cases
in
which
we
make
no
mention
of
it,
where
it
would
have
been
relevant
to
an
analysis
of
the
decision
if...
if
indeed
we
thought
it
to
be
the
law.
justice
scalia
one
swallow
doesn't
make
a
spring.
it's
that
kind
of--
justice
scalia
mr.
farr,
the
test
you
propose
really
ends
up,
doesn't
it,
to
create
all
sorts
of
odd
incentives
for
companies
to
do
business
in
some
states
or
not?
for
example,
if
michigan
should
impose
a
domiciliary
tax,
it
would
then
be
cost
free,
in
effect,
since
there
would
be
the
kind
of
conflict
you
acknowledge
would
have
to...
would
have
to
disallow...
would
it
be
the
florida
law
that
is
disallowed
in
the
event
of
that
conflict,
or
both
of
them,
by
the
way?
justice
scalia
oh,
you're
not
even
acknowledging
that
when
there
are
two
taxes
levied
it
would
be
invalid?
i
thought
you
said
that
we
would
do
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
and
that
is
you
showed
an
actual
conflict--
justice
scalia
--oh,
i
see.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
if
florida
and
michigan
had
exactly
the
same
scheme,
you
would
argue
that
both
are
valid?
justice
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago.
justice
scalia
i
see.
