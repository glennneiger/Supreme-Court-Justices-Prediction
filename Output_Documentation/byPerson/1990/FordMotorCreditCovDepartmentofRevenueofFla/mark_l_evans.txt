mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
florida's
tax
on
intangible
property
fails
this
court's
internal
consistency
test
and
violates
the
commerce
clause.
as
i
will
explain
in
a
moment,
we
think
the
case
is
controlled
by
the
court's
decision
in
armco,
which
struck
down
a
facially
discriminatory
west
virginia
tax
that
we
think
is
indistinguishable
from
the
florida
statute.
the
florida
tax
is
imposed
annually
on
the
full
value
of
two
different
categories
of
accounts
receivable
notes
and
other
obligations.
one
category
is
based
on
domicile,
the
other
one
is
based
on
business
situs.
first,
if
a...
an
intangible
asset
is
owned
by
a
florida
domiciliary,
it
is
subject
to
the
tax
without
regard
to
its
business
situs.
second,
if
the
intangible
has
a
florida
business
situs,
which
is
defined
in
the
statute
to
mean
that
it
arose
out
of
a
sale
of
property
in
florida,
it
too
is
subject
to
the
tax,
but
only
if
it
is
owned
by
a
nondomiciliary.
there
seems
to
be
no
dispute
here
that
the
tax
fails
a
straightforward
application
of
the
court's
internal
consistency
test,
and
that
is
so
because
if
every
state
had
the
precise
statute
that
florida
has,
a
interstate
company
operating
in
interstate
commerce,
domiciled
in
one
state,
selling...
financing
sales
in
another
state,
would
pay
two
taxes.
one
tax
to
his
domiciliary
state,
under
the
domicile
theory,
another
to
the
business
situs
state
under
the
business
situs
theory.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
slightly
involved
in
this
sense.
it
has
not
been
extended
to
property
taxes
in
the
name
of
an
internal
consistency
test,
but
as
we
showed
in
our
opening
brief,
the
first
instance
that
we
could
find
of
the
court
actually
using
an
internal
consistency
analysis
was
a
century
ago
in
a
case
involving
a
tax,
a
property
tax,
on
the
value
of
capital
stock
of
a
company
that,
that
owned
moving...
moving
rail
cars.
and
to
that
extent
we
think,
because
we
do
think
that
the
test
itself,
the
analysis
that
underlies
it
is
so
deeply
rooted,
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
i
think,
that
the
court
has
applied
it
to
a
property
tax
and
in
fact
a
tax
in
that
case
which
was
on
intangible
value.
just
let
me
spell
out
again
why
i
think
there
is
a...
why
i
think
there
is
an
internal
consistency
problem.
if
you're
operating
in
two
states...
domiciled
in
one
and
financing
in
the
other,
you
pay
a
domicile
tax
in
effect
to
your
domicile
state,
a
business
situs
tax
to
your
business
situs
state.
but
if
you
are
operating
in
just
one
state,
you
pay
only
a
domiciliary
tax
to
your
home
state.
the
result
is
that
an
intrastate
company
who
confines
its
operations,
its
financing
operations
to
just
its
own
state,
pays
one
tax,
while
its
competitors
have
to
pay
two.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
we
don't
see
it
that
way.
the
tax
is
identical
in
our
view
to
the
tax
that
was
at
issue
in
armco.
now,
armco
had...
armco
also
had
tax
on...
was
taxed
on
two
bases.
one
on
manufacturing
and
one
on
wholesaling.
manufacturing
tax
applied
to
all
manufactured
goods
in
west
virginia.
the
wholesaling
tax
applied
only
to
goods
manufactured
in
another
state.
the
party
challenging
that
tax
was
somebody
who
manufactured
in
ohio.
we
are
in
the
same
posture.
the
domiciliary
portion
of
this
tax
applies
to
domiciliaries,
regardless
of
where
the
business
situs
is--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--no,
we're
not.
but
we
are,
but
we
are
a
nondomiciliary,
and
the
business
situs
tax
that
florida--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--imposes
applies
only
to
nondomiciliaries,
just
like
the
west
virginia
wholesaling
tax,
but
only--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i
think,
one,
that
would
be
one
solution
to
the--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--we
think
we
do.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
question,
justice
stevens,
is
the
interaction
of
this
two
elements
of
the
tax.
we're
in--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
the
discrimination
as
we
see
it
really
isn't...
is
really
interstate
commerce
versus
intrastate
commerce.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i...
i
can't
answer
that
question
no.
we
clearly
are
hurt
by
the
system
that's
put
up,
and
we
are
hurt
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
the
ohio--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--no.
we're
hurt
by
the...
by
the
prospect
that
we
are...
and
the
fact
that
we
are
taxed
in
florida
on
the
basis
of
the
business
situs
of
our
intangibles
there,
where
our
competing
intrastate
local
banks
are
not
taxed
on
the
basis
of
business
situs.
we
are
in
exactly
the
same
posture
for
standing
purposes,
justice
stevens,
as
was
the
manufacturer
in
ohio.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
are
paying
taxes,
but
only
under
the...
only
under
the
concept
of
a
domiciliary
tax.
the
state
applies,
the
state
has
a
theory
that
both
domicile
and
business
situs
contribute
to
the
value
of
intangibles.
and
it...
but
it
only
taxes
one
of
those
things
with
respect
to
its
own
domiciliaries.
it...
it--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
let
me
try
to...
let
me
just
try
to
draw
the
parallel
to
armco,
because
we
don't
think
there
is
any
distinction
in
principle--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
let
me...
let
me
present
it
this
way.
we
are
subjected
to
a
risk
that...
that
a
local
florida--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
that's,
that's
a
part
of
it.
and
the
risk
itself
is
not,
is
not
a
cost-free
risk.
we
bear
that
risk
every
day
when
we
compete
in
a
very
competitive
financial
services
market
in
florida,
where
the
success
or
failure
can
turn
on
very
small
margins.
and
the
risk
is
something
we
have
to
take
into
account
when
we,
when
we
determine
what
our
costs
are.
a
florida
domiciliary
knows
that
under
no
circumstances
when
he
is
competing
against
us
for
a
florida
financing
opportunity,
or
a
contract
that
is
a
financing
contract,
he
knows
that
he
will
never
be
taxed
a
second
time
on
that...
on
that
receivable,
whereas
we
have
to
bear
the
risk
that
it
will
be
taxed
a
second
time.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
precisely.
and,
justice
white,
let
me
just,
recognizing
that
there
is
an
issue
beside
precedent,
precedent
does
seem
to
us
to
be
absolutely
controlling
and
indistinguishable
in
principle.
the
party
that
sued
in
armco
was
the
ohio
manufacturer.
the
argument
could
have
been
made
precisely
the
same
way
to
him,
that
he
is
being
discriminated
against,
or
he
has...
his
only
complaint
is
the
way
that
the
state
treats
its
own
manufacturers.
that
was
the
internal
consistency
problem.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
is.
that's
correct.
the
test
is--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
there
is,
although
i
know
some
members
of
the
court
don't
necessarily
agree,
there
is
good
reason
for
viewing
the
test
as
a
hypothetical
test.
the
alternatives
to
an
internal
consistency
analysis
are
only
two,
as
we
see
them.
one
is
to
accept
the
reality
of
double
taxation,
which
would
contradict
the
one
bedrock
principle,
i
think,
of
the
commerce
clause.
a
second
alternative
would
be
to
require
individualized,
case-by-case
showings
of
actual
double
taxation
in
particular
instances.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i...
justice,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
sure
that's
correct.
because,
as
i
indicate,
i
think
that
this
kind
of
analysis,
which
focuses
on
risks
and
focuses
on
the
possibility
of
other
states
doing
something
similar
to
what
the
challenge
statute
does,
has
been
with
the
court
for
nearly
a
century,
so
far
as
we
can
tell.
it
may
have
gone
back
further.
we
couldn't
find
anything
further
back.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
we
don't
say
it
was
the
whole
rationale
of
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
do
think
that
it
was
an
instance
in
which
the
court
found
it
useful
to
look
at
what
other
states
might...
what
would
happen
if
other
states
used
the
same
taxing
mechanism.
let
me
just
run
through
why
i
think
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea
to
open
up
to
actual
double
taxation
showings
in
every
case.
first
of
all,
every...
every
case
would
produce
a
lawsuit.
there
would
be
no
mechanism
by
which
these
things
would
be
resolved
other
than
by
litigation.
second,
you
would
have
the
anomaly
of
state
a,
say
florida,
adjudicating
what
michigan
in
fact
is
taxing.
there
may
be
an
argument,
for
example,
in
a
lawsuit
brought
by
ford
that
it
is
fact
being
taxed
by
michigan
on
the
basis
of
domicile,
to
which
a
state
counsel
might
respond
well,
we
don't
really
see
it
that
way.
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that
being
the
way
that
the
state
court
reads
it?
well,
we
don't
have
any
definitive
authority,
but
we
paid
our
bill.
well,
that
is
not
enough,
we
don't
see
it
that
way.
so
the
first
issue
in
the
state
court
is
going
to
be
whether
michigan
in
fact
taxes
domicile.
and
if
it
does,
the
second
argument
for
the
state's
lawyer
is,
well,
it's
not
valid.
and
so
you've
got
the
bizarre
situation
of
the
state
of
florida
having
to
adjudicate
both
the
meaning
and
the
validity
of
a
michigan
statute,
taxing
statute.
then
you
have
the
problem
of,
what
if
you
prove
it?
which
state...
which
state's
tax
gets
struck
down?
do
you
pick
the
one
that
you
happen
to
sue?
does
that
one
go?
do
you
have
to
look
to
see
whether
there
is
an
internal
consistency
at
that
point?
what
if
they
are
both
internally
consistent?
you
may
wind
up
with...
having...
allowing
taxpayers
to
pick
which
statute...
which
statute
must
yield.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it's
a
good
argument
in
favor
of
the
internal
consistency
test,
justice
white,
because
none
of
this
becomes
necessary.
as
i
say,
if
you
don't
have
a
test
that
assumes
that
other
states
can
do
what
this
state
is
doing,
which
in
fact
will
happen,
as
the
court
knows
from
its
long
history
in
this
area.
once
it
blesses
a
tax,
other
states
follow
it
because
it
has
been,
it
has
been
constitutionally
blessed
by
the
court.
and
so
that,
what
you
wind
up
with
is
either
what
i
am
describing,
if
you
don't
have
an
internal
consistency
kind
of
test,
or
you
wind
up
with
a...
with
having
to
just
suffer
actual
double
taxation.
the
one
other
consequence
of
requiring
case
by
case
showings
is
that
you
can
wind
up
with
a...
with
a
patchwork.
you've
got
different
taxpayers
being
able
to
establish
that
the
tax
is
unconstitutional
as
to
them,
because
of
the
states
they
happen
to
be
operating
in
at
a
given
time
and
the
tax
policies
of
that
state
at
that
moment,
and
other
taxpayers
who
are
identically
situated,
except
that
their
state
may
have
a
slightly
different
policy
at
that
moment,
have
a
different
constitutional
rule.
the
result
of
all
this
would
be,
i
think,
a
litigation
nightmare,
and
it's
a
good
reason
why
the
court,
i
think,
has
not
followed
that
approach.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
it
was--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
i
think
what
the
court
stumbled
along
with
was
an
internal
consistency
analysis
without
the
label
on
it,
because
the
cases
repeatedly
reflect
the
court
assuming,
for
the
sake
of
consideration
of
a
tax,
that
other
states
might,
in
fact
probably
will,
adopt
the
same
tax
if
it's
approved.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
are
very...
justice
scalia--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
that
may
be
right,
but
there...
there
are
no
cases
that
the
state
has
cited
that
took
a
contrary
position.
we
have
not
seen
any
case
in
which
the
court,
with
one
exception,
in
which
the
court
refused
to
examine
a
state
statute
on
its
own
merits
on
the
assumption
that
it
might
well
be
replicated
everywhere.
and
that
one
exception
was
in
the
general
motors
case
which
was
overruled
in
effect
by
tyler
pipe.
and
i
think
that
case
no
longer
stands.
i
think
that
was
an
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
we
think
it
is,
justice
stevens.
now,
the
argument--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--any
one
of
our
local
florida
competitors
does
not
pay
our
tax.
it
pays
the
domiciliary
tax,
just
as...
just
as
the
west
virginia
manufacturer--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
insofar
as
we're
dealing
with
intangibles
that
are...
that
have
a
florida
business
situs,
it
looks
like
they
are
paying
the
same
thing.
it
looked
in
armco
as
if
the
manufacturer
paid
more
than
his
out-of-state
competitor,
and
in
fact
that
was
chief
justice
rehnquist's
point
in
his
dissent
in
that
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
in
fact
they
are
paying
the
same
thing,
on
the
same
kind
of
basis.
it
was
a
sales
price
kind
of
tax.
and
in
fact
the
local
manufacturer
was
paying
at
a
higher
rate.
but
the--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
the--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
but
the
question
is
whether
domicile
and
business
situs
are
the
same
thing.
i
mean,
the
fact
is
that--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
the
difference
is,
and
this
may
come
back
to
your
earlier
point,
the
difference
is
that
in
looking
at
a
competitive
market
in
florida,
ford,
because
it's
an
out-of-state
domiciliary,
carries
baggage,
which
is
that
risk
that
it
might
be
subjected
to
another...
another
tax
during
the
life
of
that
receivable--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--sometime
by
another
state.
which
is
something
that
the
local
competitor
never
has
to
face.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
was
true,
i
think,
in
tyler
pipe,
and
it
was
also
true
in
armco.
there
was
that,
there
is
a
risk--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--that
one
of
the
choices
that
the
florida
legislature
could
make
in
order
to
make
its
statute
internally
consistent
is
that
it
would
still
wind
up
taxing
us
the
way
it
does
now.
but
that
is
not
the
only
choice
it
has.
it
might,
for
example,
take
away
the
exemption
that
we...
that
we
think
effectively
operates
in
florida,
which
gives
florida
domiciliaries
an
exemption
from
the
business
situs
portion
of
the
tax.
if
it
did
that,
then
our
competitors
would
pay,
we
think,
equally
on
that...
on
that
ground
in
florida.
or
it
could
wind
up
apportioning,
which
we
think
in
some
respects
is
the
proper
solution.
which...
which
is
to
say
that
if
florida's
logic,
the
logic
of
its
own
tax,
and
we
think,
this
is
a
point
we
think
is
very
effectively
made
in
our...
in
florida's
brief,
that
the
underlying
theory
of
the
internal
consistency
test
is
that
a
state
ought
to
be
required
to
adhere
to
the
logic
of
its
own
tax.
now,
it
has
in
its
very
basis
an
assumption
that
both
domicile
and
business
situs
are
contributing
factors
in
the
benefits
and
protections
that
a
state
can
provide.
what
it
does,
however,
is
it...
it
doesn't
operate
in
consistency
with
that,
with
that
theory.
to
the
extent
it
taxes
all
of
a
domicile,
all
intangibles
owned
by
a
domicile,
its
theory
is
the
domicile
is
the
entire
contributing
factor.
at
the
same
time
it
is
taxing
some
other
domiciles,
some
other...
a
person
domiciled
in
another
state,
based
on
business
situs,
which
contradicts
the
very
theory
of
the
domicile
tax.
so
either
it's...
either
it's
domicile
contributing
everything,
or
they
both
contribute
something.
if
they
both
contribute
something,
then
the
state
ought
not
be
allowed
to
tax
business
situs,
on
a
business
situs
basis,
in
full.
it
ought
to
recognize
that
there
is
somebody
else
contributing
to
the
value
of
that
intangible.
so
we
think
that
the
statute
is
inherently
defective
for
exactly
the
same
reasons
that
the
armco
statute
was
defective
and
that
the
tyler
pipe
statute
was
defective.
the
state
argues...
we
think,
justice
stevens,
that
our
situation
is
utterly
indistinguishable
from
that
in
armco.
the
fact
that
there
were
slightly
different
labels
on
the
tax...
that
is,
there
is
a
manufacturing
tax
and
a,
and
a
wholesaling
tax...
made
no
difference,
because
the
taxes
were
basically
the
same...
operated
the
same
way.
and
for
the
out-of-state
manufacturer,
he
faced
a
wholesaling
tax
from
which
his
local
competitor
was
exempt.
now,
the
answer
to
that
during
the
debate
in
the
court,
presumably,
and
certainly
the
arguments
in
brief,
was
that
well,
that's
true,
but
the
manufacturer...
the
local
manufacturer's
paying
a
higher
tax.
and
it's
really
the
same
tax
for
the
goods
sold
in
west
virginia,
the
local
manufacturer
is
paying
not
only
what
the
outsider
is,
but
actually
more.
and
the
court
said
that
was
not
an
answer
to
that,
that
in
effect
there
was
an
internal
inconsistency
that
required...
that
required
or
subjected
the
out-of-state
manufacturers
to
risks
of
double
taxation
that
the
local
manufacturer
did
not
have.
that
problem
could
have
been
solved
in
some
respects
the
same
way
that
your
question
suggested
earlier.
that
is
west
virginia
could
have
said
we
are
going
to
abandon
our
local
manufacturing
tax
and
we're
going
to
subject
our
local
manufacturers
to
the
same
tax
that
the
out-of-staters
are
subjected
to,
and
the
out-of-state
manufacturer
would
have
been
left
in
the
same
position.
those
are
just
options
for
solution.
but
the
fact
is
that
right
now
we
are
faced
with
a
statute
that
leaves
us
exposed
to
risks
that
local
companies
are
not
exposed
to,
and
that
is,
for
reasons
that
we
think
are
sound,
incompatible
with
the...
at
least
the
recent
court's
decisions
on
internal
consistency.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
let
me
just
start
where
mr.
farr
left
off
on
credits.
this
is
an
issue
that
was
discussed
as
well
in
tyler
pipe,
in
which
the
court
specifically
said
that
credits
might
be
a
solution.
and
in
fact
the...
the
complaining
parties
in
tyler
pipe,
if
a
credit
had
been
provided,
would
have
likewise,
at
least
prospectively,
been
arguably
no
better
off
than
they
were
before
they
came
to
court.
on
the
question
of
refunds,
we
have
not
conceded
anything.
that's
not
an
issue
that's
here
at
this
point.
it's
a
matter
for
remedy
that
the
court
has
spelled
out,
and
the
contours
of
which
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
the
court
has
spelled
out
recently
in
mckesson.
we
are
not
in
a
refund
posture.
we're
here
under
an
assessment.
we
have
not
paid
the
tax,
we
have
posted
a
bond
for
it.
we
have
paid
a
portion
of
the
tax,
and
we
are
not
suing
for
refund
of
that.
so
we
are
not
even
in
a
refund
posture.
insofar
as
a
retroactive
or
retrospective
remedy,
we
think
it's
something
that
ought
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
florida
courts,
and
in
fact
the
florida
courts
have
at
least
some
cases
suggesting
that
a
taxpayer
is
not
required
to
pay
a
tax
under
a
statute
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
there--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
i
think
to
a
certain
extent
that
may
be,
that
may
be
right.
and
it,
it
reminds
me,
justice
kennedy,
of
a
point
that
i
believe
was
in
justice
stevens'
concurring
opinion
in
the
goldberg
case,
which
is
that
the
fact
that
one
state
cedes
or
declines
to
adopt
a
tax
doesn't
mean
that
somebody
else
can
take
that
state's
share.
i
think
that
in...
there
are
about
half
of
the
states
that,
at
least
as
we
have
identified
in
a
rough
survey,
that
have
some
form
of
intangible
taxation.
about
five
or
six
of
them,
or
so,
look
pretty
much
like
florida's.
they
have
a...
looks
on
the
face
of
it
at
least
to
be
an
internal
inconsistency,
taxing
both
on
the
basis
of
domicile
and
on
the
basis
of...
or
alternatively
on
the
basis
of
business
situs.
a
couple
of
them
choose
one
or
the
other,
and
then
there
are
a
large
category
that
is
just
not
decipherable
in
the
face
of
the
statute
what
they
do.
but
clearly,
intangible
values
are
taxed
elsewhere,
and
it
may
be
that
michigan
chooses
to
require
its
domiciliaries
to
pay
their
share
of
state
and
local
services
that
are
provided
within
the
state
to
domiciliaries
in
some
other
form,
rather
than
an
intangible
property
tax.
clearly
this
is
not
a
free
ride
for
ford
motor
credit
company,
and
it
ought
not
to
be
a...
an
opening,
in
effect,
in
the
line
for
florida.
i...
now...
mr.
farr
seems
to
have
said
something
that
was
also
in
the
brief
that
i
just
want
to
address
briefly.
the
notion
that
the
court's
decisions
in
the
1940's,
late
1930's
and
1940's,
on
due
process
grounds
bear
on
the
issue
here,
we
think
is
really
quite
far
fetched.
those
cases
were
due
process
cases
where
the
issue
was
one
issue
only,
namely
did
a
nondomiciliary
state
have
the
jurisdiction
to
tax
property
owned
by...
that
was
in
the
state
but
that
was
not
owned
by
one
of
its
own
domiciliaries,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
was
yes.
there
was
never
any
consideration
in
those
cases
about
multiple
taxation,
because
the
issue
was
a
due
process
issue,
and
not
an
interstate...
impeding
of
interstate
commerce
issue.
the
fact
is
that
the
one
time
when
the
author
of
the
key
opinion,
chief
justice
stone,
addressed
the
issue,
he
specifically
said,
and
we
quoted
this
in
our
reply
brief,
which
i
am
not
finding
right
now,
this
was
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
northwest
airlines
at
332
u.s.
he
said,
in
response
really
to
an
argument
that
mr.
farr
has
made,
that
yes,
domicile
can
be
important
and
it
can
give
a
basis
for
state
taxation
of
intangibles
that
might
otherwise
not
be
available
in
the
case
of
tangible
property.
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
taxation
of
intangibles
of
interstate
companies
is
subject
to
the
rule
of
apportionment,
wherever
the
tax--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i'm--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i'm
sorry.
this
is
on
page
15
of
our
reply
brief.
he
is
saying
that
the
taxation
of
intangibles,
when
it's...
when
they
are
owned
by
interstate
companies,
is
subject
to
the
rule
of
apportionment,
wherever
the
tax
without
it
would
subject
the
commerce
to
the
burden
of
multiple
state
taxation.
and
to
suggest
that
double
taxation
is
permissible
on
some
domiciliary
hearing
when
you
are
talking
about
interstate
commerce
strikes
me
as
quite...
quite
bizarre
in
the
current--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
oh...
by
florida.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no.
it
could
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
would
be...
i
mean,
i
think
that's
pretty
settled
in
the
court's
decisions.
in
the
area
of
real
property
you
can
only
tax
what
is
within
your
borders.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
was
chief
justice
stone's
dissenting
opinion
in
northwest
airlines,
which
is
in
332
u.s.,
and
the
quote
i
was
reading
to
you
was
at
page
318.
it
was
in
response
to
an
argument
that,
very
much
like
mr.
farr's,
that
multiple
taxation
is
all
right
when
you
are
dealing
with
taxation
by
domicile
states,
and
we're
talking
about...
in
that
case
we're
talking
about
airlines
and
tangible
property.
but
there
was
reference
made
to
intangibles
in
his
response.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
332
u.s.,
and
this
was
at
page--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--chief
justice
stone.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
the
citation
is--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i
will
double
check
it.
my
mistake.
323.
we
missed...
cite
checkers
missed
it.
in
response
to
the
argument
he
also
cited
a
number
of
other
cases
dealing
with,
and
these
are
also
cited
at
page
15
of
the
reply
brief,
a
number
of
other
cases
that
did
deal
with
the
possible
problem
of
multiple
taxation
of
intangible
property,
going
back...
back
again
into
the
19th
century.
now,
mr.
farr
said
that
the
risk
that
we
face
would...
we
would
still
face
even
if,
even
if
the
state
abandoned
its
domicile
tax,
as
he
suggested,
and
left
in
place
simply
a
business
situs
tax
applicable
to
everybody.
and
that's
true.
we
would
face
a
risk.
it
would
be
a
slightly
different
risk,
and
while
it
would
look
the
same,
it
would
offer
different
opportunities.
at
least
we
would
have
an
opportunity,
or
a
company
with
a
domicile
outside
the
state
would
have
an
opportunity
to
change
domiciles
if
its
own
domicile
state
adopted
a
domiciliary
tax.
in
that
event
it
would
pay
no
tax
in
florida,
because
florida
doesn't
have
a
domicile
tax,
and
it
would
pay
no
tax
in
the
state
it
used
to
be
domiciled
in
because
it
has
no
business
situs
tax.
furthermore,
firms
generally,
although
individual
firms
might
face
risks
and
might
be
hurt,
firms
generally,
on
balance,
operating
in
interstate
commerce
would
fare
about
as
well
as
those
operating
in
intrastate
commerce.
because,
as
i
say,
while
some
might
ultimately
have
to
pay
two
taxes,
others
will
get
away
with
paying
none.
and
finally,
while
there...
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
limit
beyond
which
the
court
can't
go,
consistent
with
principles
of
federalism,
we
cannot
tell
florida
that
it
cannot
adopt
a...
an
internally
consistent
tax
on
the
basis
of
business
situs
or
domicile
simply
because
michigan
chooses
to
adopt
a
different
internally
consistent
tax
on
a
different
basis.
that's
the
irreducible
minimum
required
by
principles
of
federalism.
but
we
can
tell
florida
that
it
cannot
adopt
an
internally
inconsistent
statute
that
enhances
the
risks
beyond
those
that
are
the
minimum
necessary
to
preserve
federalist
principles.
one
final
comment.
we
have
been...
the
court
has
been
debating
questions
of
internal
consistency
now
actively
for
almost
a
decade.
almost
every
argument
that
has
been
presented
in
the
briefs
here
has
been
thoroughly
debated
in
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court.
there
is
no
distinction,
no
distinction
that
we
can
see
in
principle
between
applying
the
test
here
and
applying
the
test
in
the
cases
that
have
already
been
decided.
to
whatever
extent
there
is
any
difference,
we
think
it's
an
easier
case
here,
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
property
tax,
where
assets
have
one
value,
much
like
income
does.
but
in
any
event,
it's
time
for
some
stability
in
the
law.
it's
an
issue
that
is
constantly
in
play.
and
the
court
has
now
decided
five
cases
since
1983
in
which
it
has
indicated
that
internal
consistency
is
a
special
test
to
screen
for
defective
state
taxes.
it
has
been
a
hotly
debated
issue,
but
it
is
now,
i
think,
time
to
settle
it
and
leave
it
in
place.
states
ought
to
begin
to
deal
with
this
test,
which
is
not
difficult
for
them
to
apply,
is
not
onerous
with
respect
to
their
options,
and
which
ought
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
states
that
way
rather
than
as
another
opportunity
for
litigating
commerce
clause
issues.
thank
you.
