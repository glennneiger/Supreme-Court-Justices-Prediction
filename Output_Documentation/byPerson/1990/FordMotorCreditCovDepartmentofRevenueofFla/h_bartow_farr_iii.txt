mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ford
in
this
case
has
used
the
internal
consistency
test
to
make
two
challenges
in
its
brief
to
florida's
intangible
taxes,
one
based
on
the
situs
tax
alone,
and
one
to
the
situs
tax
combined
with
the
domiciliary
tax.
ford
has
not
pressed
the
first
argument
here
this
morning,
and
we,
i
believe,
have
answered
it
fully
in
our
brief
by
pointing
out
that
there
is
no
internal
consistency
problem
resulting
from
the
situs
test
itself.
so
i
would
like
to
move
directly
to
the
second
point,
which
is
the
combination
of
the
situs
and
the
domiciliary
tax,
and
set
out,
if
i
may,
just
briefly
at
the
beginning,
what
our
position
is
on
that.
simply
put,
it
is
this.
that
the
court
shouldn't
use
the
internal
consistency
test
to
strike
down
a
taxing
scheme
when
the
hypothetical
tax
is
based
on
domicile,
and
so
the
taxes
of
only
one
other
state
are
likely
to
be
at
issue,
and
when
a
relatively
simply
factual
inquiry
shows
that
the
taxpayer
in
fact
paid
only
one
tax
on
its
property,
just
like
its
local
competitors.
the
situation
typically
in
which
the
court
has
used
the
internal
consistency
test,
as
the
court
has
noted
in
using
it,
have
been
cases
where
when
one
hypothesizes
the
use
of
the...
of
a
particular
tax,
one
might
conceivably
be
looking
to
cumulative
taxation
by
49
other
states
on
the
same
basis.
that
is
simply
not
a
situation
that
arises
in
the
case
of
the
tax
based
on
domicile.
in
that
kind
of
situation
we
know
in
advance
that
there
is
likely
to
be
only
one
other
state
that
is
asserting
taxing
jurisdiction,
and
you
do
not
have
the
same
kind
of
impractical
inquiry
that
you
would
have
with
manufacturing
taxes
and
selling
taxes,
which
could
be
levied
for
a
particular
taxpayer
by
a
number
of
different
states,
when
the
basis
of
the
hypothetical
tax
is,
as
it
is
in
this
case,
simply
domicile.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
we
would
in
fact
make
such
an
argument
based
on
the
due
process
clause
cases.
but
there,
what
i
am
saying
here--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
there
is
an
additional
basis
for
taxation
provided
by
domicile,
as
the
court
has
recognized,
that
goes
beyond
the
usual
situs
basis.
but
that
is
not
the
necessary
part
of
the
argument
i'm
making
here.
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
it
is
a
very
simple
question
to
look
and
see
whether
in
fact
michigan
had
this
tax,
and
very
easy
to
see
that
it
did
not.
so
in
fact,
when
we
move
away
from
the
hypothetical
and
move
to
actual
practical
considerations,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
ford
paid
only
one
tax
on
its
florida
intangibles.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
what
i
am
looking
at,
i
think,
justice
stevens,
is
the
general
run
of
cases.
i
think
there
would
be
exceptions
in
any
particular
setting
of
the
internal
consistency
test.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
you
can
be
assured--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--right.
when
you
are
looking
at
any,
a
challenge
by
any
particular
taxpayer.
and
i
think,
though,
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
what
we're
talking
about.
it
may
be
possible
for
using
the
internal
consistency
test
to
essentially
litigate
the
double
taxation
or
discrimination
against
another
taxpayer
from
another
state,
which
is
what
ford
is
trying
to
do.
what
we're
saying
is
that
where
you
don't
have
the
kind
of
difficult
factual
inquiry
that
is
likely
to
arise
in
other
settings,
there
is
no
reason
to
move
past
ford's
particular
situation,
which
shows
that
it
did
not
pay
a
domiciliary
tax,
and
thus
paid
a
single
tax
only.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
there
has
been
no
argument
about
it
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference.
delaware
has
not--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
might
in
a
possible
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
mean
there
is,
frankly,
i
think
there's
a
question
after
wheeling
steel
v.
fox
whether
a
domiciliary
state
which
bases
its
claim
to
domicile
solely
on
incorporation
would
in
fact
be
able
to
tax.
so
i
doubt
that
would
arise,
but
that
is
at
least
a
possible
consideration.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
suggestion
i
am
making,
i
believe,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
in
this
kind
of
situation
for
this
type
of
claim,
that
really
the
tax
should
be
looked
at
as
applied
to
a
particular
taxpayer.
so
that
a
statute
that
has
essentially
what
might
be
argued
to
be
a
logical
inconsistency
but
causes
no
harm
to
a
particular
taxpayer
should
not
be
struck
down
with
regard
to
that
taxpayer.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
there
are
certainly
examples
where
the
court
has
said,
for
example
in
northwestern
states
cement,
which
is
358
u.s.,
the
court
says
we
are
not
going
to
look
at
a
hypothetical
claim.
there
is
no
actual
double
taxation
in
this
case,
therefore
we
will
no
go
on
and
address
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
hypothetical
problem
with
the
statute
itself.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
perfectly
sound
basis
where
the
inquiry
as
to
the
particular
taxpayer
can
be
made
relatively
straightforwardly.
and
i
think
this
is
an
obvious
example
of
that
kind
of
case.
taking
for
a
moment
the
inquiry
that
i
am
proposing,
which,
as
i
say,
departs
somewhat
from
the
idea
of
using
hypothetical
taxing
burdens
and
looking
at
actual
burdens,
what...
what
do
we
see
in
this
case?
as
i
have
said,
we
see
that
ford
has
not
paid
a
domiciliary
tax
to
michigan,
and
indeed
hasn't
paid
one
to
delaware
either,
should
that
be
the
possible
alternative.
when
you
look
at
what
ford
really
puts
most
of
its
emphasis
on,
you
turn
to
the
question
of
what
are
the
risks
of
double
taxation.
and
there
concededly
is
language
in
the
court's
opinion
that
talk
about
risk
as
part
of
commerce
clause
analysis.
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
it's
worth
taking
a
hard
look
in
a
case
like
this
at
what
the
risks
really
are,
because
risks
are
very
easy
to
exaggerate.
what
do
we
know
about
the
risk
that
ford
faced
in
michigan,
its
domicile
state,
in
1980,
1981,
and
1982,
which
are
the
years,
the
taxing
years
that
are
in
question
here?
the
first
thing
we
know
about
them
is
that
in
fact
the
risk
of
a
domiciliary
tax
didn't
materialize.
michigan
did
not
impose
the
tax
during
those
years
in
question.
second,
and
more
importantly,
we
know
that
the
risk,
at
best,
because
of
the
nature
of
ford's
argument,
is
simply
a
marginal
risk.
ford
has
based
its
argument
here
solely
on
the
internal
consistency
clause.
yet
ford
concedes,
as
it
has
to,
that
if
in
those
years
michigan
had
had
a
domiciliary
tax
and
ford...
excuse
me,
and
florida
had
had
a
situs
tax,
so
long
as
florida
didn't
itself
have
a
domiciliary
tax,
the
two
statutes
together
would
meet
the
internal
consistency
test.
so
what
that
leaves
ford
with
when
it
talks
about
risks
is
essentially
an
incremental
risk,
the
idea
that
michigan
wouldn't
tax
its
domiciliary
corporations
on
its
own.
it
would
only
do
so
essentially
in
sort
of
a
copy
cat
fashion,
because
florida
has
done
so.
and
even
there,
i
might
suggest,
that
if
michigan
were
to
consider
a
domiciliary
tax,
what
you
don't
have
in
this
case
is
what
you
have
in
so
many
commerce
clause
cases,
the
difficulty
of
an
out-of-state
corporation
facing
taxing
decisions
by
a
state
in
which
it's
not
located.
we
are
talking
about
the
possibility
of
a
tax
imposed
by
ford's
own
domicile,
where
ford
presumably
has
substantial
political
power.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
hate
to
interrupt
your
question,
but
i
don't
concede
that
one
or
the
other
would
have
to
be
disallowed.
i
would
suggest
that
under
the
due
process
cases
they
both
could
stand
compatibly.
i
am
saying
the
court
need
not
reach
that
issue
in
this
case,
because
there
in
fact
are
not
two
taxes
being
levied.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
then
you
would
have
to
decide
the
issue
as
to
whether
both
taxes
could
legitimately
be
sustained.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that,
that
is
the
approach
the
court
took
in
cases
like
curry
v.
mccanless.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
would
argue
that
both
are
valid.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
white.
following
the
due
process
cases
from
the
late
1930's
and
1940's,
i
would
argue
that
because
of
the
special
nature
of
a
domiciliary
corporation
and
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--benefits
that
the
court
has
recognized
the
state
gives,
that
it
could
indeed
have
extra
taxing
power.
but
i
want
to
make
clear
the
point
i
am
making
here
is
i
do
not
believe
it
makes
sense
to
decide
that
issue
in
a
case
where
no
domiciliary
tax
on
ford
has
been
imposed.
and
that
is,
i
think,
the
point
that
ford
is
raising.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
the
sense
that
it
would
then
be
subject
to
double
taxation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
possibility.
i
would
say
that
the
issues
of
double
taxation,
precisely
the
point
that
you
are
making
though,
is
what
the
court
spent
really
a
decade
and
a
half
wrestling
with
from
about
1930
until
the
early
1940's,
exactly
trying
to
draw
the
kinds
of
distinctions
that
you
are
making--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
came
closer
to
pinning
at
the
end,
i
think,
when
it
made
its
second
reversal,
if
i
can
continue
the
wrestling
metaphor,
to
say
that
in
fact
there
was
a
legitimacy
to
double
taxation
of
intangibles
by
both
the
domiciliary
state
and
the
situs
state.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
i
would
not
make
the
same
argument.
as
i
said,
i
think
even...
if
the
basis
of
the
hypothetical
tax
is
situs,
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
basis
that
maybe
is
sort
of--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
i
mean,
as
i...
to
me,
and
perhaps
this
is
a
misstatement,
but
as
i
see
the
internal
consistency
test,
it
essentially
carves
out
an
exception
to
general
constitutional
principles
of
how
you
approach
an
attack
under...
on
constitutional
ground
state
statutes.
and
it
seems
to
me
where
there
are
practical
reasons
for
essentially
allowing
the
tax...
the
to
be
based
on
hypothetical
grounds,
that
maybe
the
usual
practice
should
yield.
but
i
don't
see
it
in
the
case
where
the
hypothetical
tax
is
the
domicile.
i
would
like
to
just
say
one
more
thing
about
the
subject
of
risk,
again
because
i
think
ford
has
given
it
considerable
emphasis.
the...
you
know,
we
certainly
don't
disagree
that
there
was
this
marginal
risk
that
i
mentioned
before,
this
incremental
risk
that
ford
might
be
subject
to
tax
by
michigan.
but
when
we
are
talking
about
that
as
a
basis
for
challenging
the
florida
statute,
it
does
seem
appropriate
to
remember
that
the
florida
companies,
the
competitors
that
ford
keeps
talking
about,
not
only
pay
tax
on
exactly
the
same
intangibles
in
florida
as
did
ford,
but
in
fact
were
subject
to
a
real
tax,
not
a
hypothetical
tax,
on
their
intangibles
in
49
other
states.
and
one
question
i
suppose
i
would
raise
here
is,
for
all
their
talk
about
multiple
burdens
and
discrimination
and
lack
of
allocation,
is
there
any
reasonable
likelihood
that
in
1980,
1981,
or
1982
ford
would
have
changed
places
with
the
florida
domiciliary
corporations
insofar
as
taxes
on
intangibles
were
concerned?
that
is
usually
the
question
that
comes
up
in
any
commerce
clause
case,
or
at
least
something
that
underlies
it,
when
you
say
that
our
competitors
are
being
advantaged
here.
but
we
submit
that
there
is
no
way
that
ford
would
have
said
we
would
rather
be
treated
as
a
florida
domiciliary,
in
fact,
and
we
were
treated
as
we
were.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
not
to
my
knowledge,
justice
stevens.
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point
on
the
question
of
the
particular
type
of
inquiry
here.
ford
again
concedes,
as
i
think
it
must,
that
so
long
as
florida
took
action
that
met
internal
consistency,
it
would
not
be
necessarily
entitled
to
a
refund.
in
tyler
pipe
this
court
pointed
out
that
any
problem
with
internal
consistency
in
that
case
could
be
solved
for
out-of-state
manufacturers
by
providing
a
credit
against
the
out-of-state
tax
on
the
tax
levied
by
the
state
of
washington
in
that
case.
assuming
that
florida
could
do
the
same
thing
here,
and
we
don't
see
any
reason
why
they
couldn't
simply
to
achieve
the
consistency
that
florida
is
talking
about,
ultimately
that
credit
would
do
ford
no
good
whatsoever.
it
has
nothing
in
fact
to
credit
from
its
domiciliary
state.
so
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
superficial
difference
because
a
florida
corporation
arguably
gets
a
credit
against
one
tax
and
only
has
to
pay
once,
even
if
florida
applied
exactly
the
same
rule
to
ford,
there
would
be
no
difference
whatsoever
in
the
judgment
that
is
in
front
of
the
court
at
this
point,
the
judgment
that
says
they
owe
the
taxes
for
1980,
1981,
and
1982.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further,
thank
you.
