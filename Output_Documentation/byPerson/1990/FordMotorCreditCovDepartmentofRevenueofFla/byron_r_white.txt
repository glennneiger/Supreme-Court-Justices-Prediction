justice
white
and
you,
i
suppose
you
say
that's
a...
you're
permitted
to
raise
this
issue
by
the
internal
consistency
rule?
justice
white
it
sounds
like
a
good
argument
against
the
internal
consistency
rule.
justice
white
well,
i
think...
i
suppose
you
would
argue
then
if
michigan
had
exactly
the
same
scheme
as
florida,
that
both...
both
states'
tax
laws
would
be
valid?
justice
white
because
you
think
the
domiciliary
basis
for
taxation
is
perfectly
valid.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
that
if
michigan
had
a
tax
like
florida's
on
domiciliaries,
it
would
certainly
be...
it
certainly
would
put
a...
it
certainly
would
deter,
i
suppose,
a
domiciliary
in
michigan
from
doing
business
in
florida
or
any
other
state
that
had
a
tax
like
that.
justice
white
why,
yes,
yes.
and
if
you
are
going
to
pay,
if
you
would
have
to
pay
two
taxes
on
your
intangibles
if
you
went
to
florida,
you'd
stay
out
of
florida.
justice
white
and
never
got
a
fall.
justice
white
and
never
pinned.
never,
never
got...
and
it
never
pinned
anybody.
