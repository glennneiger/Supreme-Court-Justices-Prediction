justice
kennedy
under
your
view,
mr.
farr,
if
michigan
had
a
tax
and
ford
could
show
double
taxation
in
this
case,
and
if
the
court,
when
it
went
on
to
say
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
would
the
tax
then
be
invalid
just
as
ford,
so
that
companies
that
came
from
states
that
did
not
have
the
domiciliary
tax
would
still
have
to
pay
the
tax?
or
is
the
tax
struck
down
in
its
face?
or...
i
don't
know
how
it
would,
how
your
theory
would
work.
justice
kennedy
do
we
have
examples
in
our
jurisprudence
where
this
approach
has
been
followed?
justice
kennedy
counsel,
is
it
possible
to
speculate
that
these
intangibles
are
included
in
some
overall
tax
schemes
of
other
states,
general
property
tax?
justice
kennedy
and
so
that
it
would
follow
from
that
that
michigan
has
foregone...
has
foregone
to
levy
on
these
in
lieu
of
its
tax?
justice
kennedy
where
is
this?
justice
kennedy
where
is
this
from?
