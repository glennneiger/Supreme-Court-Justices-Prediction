unknown
speaker
will
we
need
to
decide
both?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
win
if
we
decide
either
one
of
them
your
way.
unknown
speaker
in
examining
that
issue,
did
the
arizona...
was
the
arizona
supreme
court
confined
just
to
the
suppression
motion
that
the
judge
ruled
on
or
could
it
and
should
it
also
take
into
account
the
evidence
that
might
have
been
given
at
trial
on
the
point?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
hear
that
issue,
we
look
at
the
same
testimony?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
we
owe
some
deference
to
the
court's
findings
in...
of
a
coerced
confession?
unknown
speaker
but
that
court
drew
some
inferences
from
the
trial
court
record
and
on
that
basis
made
its
finding
of
coercion.
it's
a
little
hard
for
us
to
undo
that,
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
that
sarivola
said
that
his
name
that...
he
was
going
to
be
carried
out
horizontally
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
not
recounted
again
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
jarrett,
you
concede,
however,
that
the
fbi
informant,
before
the...
immediately
before
the
conversation
at
which
the
confession
was
made,
did
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
been
receiving
hard
treat...
he
heard
the
defendant
had
been
receiving
hard
treatment
from
other
inmates
and
that
he
could
protect
him
from
that,
but
if
he...
if
he
wanted
such
protection,
he'd
have
to
be
open
with
him
about
everything.
unknown
speaker
and
you
concede
that
all
of
that
was
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
two
different
courts?
isn't
it
the
supreme
court
that
found
that
it
was
coerced?
and
this
is
the
finding
by
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
in
the
trial
court
there
was
not
coerced,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
inconsistency
there,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
they
referred
to
this
specific
language
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
in
connection
with
affirming
the
aggravating
circumstance,
right?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
big
was
he?
unknown
speaker
how
big
was
this...
the
informant?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
everybody
seemed
to
understand
the
informant
was
in
a
position
through
his
connections
or
otherwise
to
provide
protection
to
somebody
who
might
otherwise
be
violently
treated
by
inmates,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
clear
up
one
thing?
were
any
of
these
confessions
taped
or
were...
or
is
this
all
the
testimony
of
sarivola
as
to
what
the
man
told
him?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
whole...
the
facts
that
you
describe
are
entirely
based
on
the
testimony
of
this
individual--
unknown
speaker
--sarivola?
unknown
speaker
whom?
unknown
speaker
the
wife?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
confession
wasn't
with
any
kind
of
an
inducement
i...
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
second
confession
was...
was
or
was
not
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree?
unknown
speaker
then
on
rehearing,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
said
that
the
admission
of
a
involuntary
confession
can't
be
harmless
error,
and
so
they
reversed...
i
suppose
they
didn't
have
to
go
back
under
that
line
of
reasoning
and
decide
again
whether
the
second
confession
was
the
fruit
of
a
poisonous
tree.
the
admission
of
the
first
confession
made
the...
the
judgment
infirm...
or
the
verdict
infirm.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mrs.
jarrett.
mr.
larkin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
larkin,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
at
least
articulated
in
its
opinion
that
it
was
applying
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
that's
why
bram
reached
that
conclusion
or
did
it
see
the
logical
contradiction
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
i
recognize
that,
but
we're
talking
about
the
logical
contradiction
that
the
court
thought
that
it
saw
in
bram.
did
it
see
that
just
because
the
confession
was
the
only
piece
of
evidence?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying,
mr.
larkin,
just
to
be
sure
that
i
get
it,
that
if
the...
this
case
were
retried
without
the
sarivola
confession
admitted
that
all
the
other
evidence
admitted,
you
can
say
that...
the
judge
would
state
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
man
would
be
convicted?
unknown
speaker
so
the
result
is
purely
to
save
the
cost
to
the
state
of
a
retrial.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ultimate
outcome
and
being
sure
you
get
the
right
verdict,
because
you'll
get
the
right
verdict
anyway.
unknown
speaker
this
guy
will
go
to
jail
no
matter
what
we
do.
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
be
true
in
every
comparable
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
only
that,
but
if
you
lose
on
retrial
and
if
the
evidence
is
excluded,
in
every
case
we
would
be
able
to
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
he
would
be
reconvicted
because
the
other
evidence
is
so
power...
powerful.
unknown
speaker
so
all
that's
at
stake--
--assuming
the
jury
does
its
duty.
unknown
speaker
right.
mr.
larkin,
can
you
conceive
of
a
confession
that
would
not
be
considered
harmless
error
because
it
was
such
a
bad
way
of
getting
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
that
considered
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
constraint
is
there
on
the
offices
of
government
in
arizona
to
prevent
them
from
denying
people
their
rights?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
restraint
at
all?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
you
and
the
members
of
this
court
are
better
able
to
decide
that
than
the
supreme
court
of
arizona?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
we
know
what
goes
on
in
arizona?
unknown
speaker
is
what
you
tell
us.
unknown
speaker
in
deciding...
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
what...
the
error's
harmless.
you've
described
it
as
though
it
means
another
jury...
a
different
jury
would
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
but
what
if
i
think
that
the
test
of
harmlessness
should
rather
be
would
this
jury...
did
this
jury
rely
upon...
substantially
rely
upon
that
evidence--
unknown
speaker
--in
reaching
its
conclusion?
and
if
i
believe
that
the
latter
is
the
test,
there
may
be
some
sense
in
a
special
rule
for
coerced
confessions,
because
nothing
is
as...
is
as
conclusive
as
a
confession.
the
jury
might
well
not
even
look
at
the
rest
of
the
evidence.
they
say,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
rest.
you
have
the
man's
confession
right
here.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
this
jury
might
have
gotten
together,
when
you
have
this
kind
of
a
confession,
might
have
gotten
together
in
the
jury
room
and
said,
look
it,
we
have
this
confession.
we
don't
even
have
to
look
at
the
rest
of
the
evidence,
don't
you
think
this
confession
is
enough.
and
they
all
say,
yes,
that's
right.
so
the
jury
never
really
even
considered
the
rest
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
collins,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
that
this
was
extremely
coercive,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
uh,
what
evidence
supports
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
other
side
disagrees
mightily
with
that,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
is
borne
out
based
on
the
stipulated
testimony
that
was
given
to
the
trial
judge
or
does
it
necessarily
rely
on
what
was
testified...
what
was
the
testimony
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
do
you...
do
you
interpret
the
testimony
that
was
given
to
the
judge
by
stipulation
in
connection
with
the
suppression
hearing
fully
sufficient
to
support
the
interpretation
of
the
evidence
that
you've
just
given
to
mr.
justice
blackmun?
unknown
speaker
that
sarivola
told
fulminate
that
fulminate's
life
was
endangered?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
if
you
get
that
interpretation
just
from
the
stipulated
facts?
unknown
speaker
how...
how
can...
isn't
that
a
rather
extravagant
statement
since
the
concept
of
harmless
error
had
never
even
been
developed
at
the
time
that
the
framers
sat
in
1787?
unknown
speaker
and
then--
unknown
speaker
--what
part
did
patrick
henry
play
in
drafting
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
wasn't
even
there,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
do
you
think
that
our
recent
holding
in
perkins
against
illinois
has
any
bearing
on
whether
this
confession
was
coerced?
unknown
speaker
is,
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
was
in
danger
while
in
prison
from
the
other
inmates?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
the
state's
position
is
that
he
could
have
sought
protective
custody.
unknown
speaker
can
you
again
tell
me
where
that
is
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
did
he
say
your
life...
your
life
is
in
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
arizona
supreme
court
relied
essentially
on
the
bram
decision
in
drawing
its
conclusions
about
the
coercive
nature--
unknown
speaker
--of
that
first
confession?
unknown
speaker
well,
bram
talks
about
promises,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
any
inducement,
no
matter
how
small?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you're
relying
on
that,
too?
unknown
speaker
or
any
inducement.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
limiting
the
rule
you
propose
we
adopt
to
what
i
might
call
really
coerced
confessions.
i
mean,
i
assume
you
would
continue
to
apply
bram
to
failure
to
give
the
miranda
warning
which
causes
the
confession
to
be
deemed
coerced,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
you
don't...
you
don't
make
that
distinction
in
your
brief
that
i
recall,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
coerced
confession
is
sort
of
a
term
of
art,
and
it
includes
any
confession
that,
for
example,
doesn't
comply
with
the
requirements
of
miranda.
do
you
think
we
can
draw
a
line
between
some
other
confessions
and
a
really
coerced
confession?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
uh.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
agree
with
the
government
i
suppose
that
if
the
court
had
relied
on
this
"any
inducement
however
small
or
any
promise."
that
the
court
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
on
retrial
are...
is
the
issue
of
whether
the
second
confession
is...
may
come
into
evidence,
is
that
resolved
now
against
the
defendant
conclusively?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
collins,
you
could
say
that
about
the
harmless
error
doctrine
generally,
that
it
does
dispense
with
a
bright-line
rule
where
any
error
was
made
reversible.
but
the
judgment
of
certainly
the
state
courts
and
of
this
court
for
20
years
has
been
that
in
many
cases
harmless
error
is
a
permissible
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it's
a
question
of
whether
this
right
is
to
be
properly
numbered
among
that
one
bundle
or
another.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
collins,
in
the
case
of
milton
against
wainwright,
this
court
indicated
that
admission
of
a
confession
allegedly
obtained
in
violation
of
fifth
as
well
as
sixth
amendment
rights
could
be
harmless
error.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
that
case
has
been
relied
on
by
some
lower
courts,
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
25
other
cases
simply
have
dicta
to
that
effect
or
are
they
direct
holdings
for
your
position?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
he
could
hold
off
all
the
other
inmates?
unknown
speaker
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
but
he
wasn't
so
susceptible
to
donna
was
he?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
said
that
you
were
foreclosed
to
challenge
the
second
rule
for
a
confession?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
defendant
had
asked
for
counsel...
and
this
is
the
only
degree
of
coercion
there
is...
he...
they
tried
to
interrogate
him.
he
asked
for
counsel.
they
said
all
right,
we'll
send
for
counsel,
but
they
continued
to
interrogate
him
before
counsel
arrived.
now
we
would
consider
that
under
our
case
as
a
coerced
confession.
would
that
be
the
kind
of
coerced
confession
that
you
think
harmless
error
would
not
apply
to?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
really
coerced
confession
or
not
a
really--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
not
a
really--
unknown
speaker
--can
you
tell
us
generally
where
in
the
transcript
the
testimony
is
that
you're
referring
to
now?
i
realize
you
said
you
don't
have
a
page
citation.
is
it
somewhere
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
federal
rule,
mr.
collins?
unknown
speaker
to
prove
a
statement
by
the
defendant
admissible?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
other...
to
prove
it
was
not
coercive,
the
state
certainly
has
no
motive
to
proving
that
conduct
was
coercive.
unknown
speaker
it's
in--
unknown
speaker
--not
coerced.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
mrs.
jarrett,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
language
that
the
respondent
here
relies
on
and
perhaps
the
arizona...
that
you...
telling
him
his
life
was
in
danger?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
statement
by
sarivola
to
fulminante
that
his
life
was
in
danger?
unknown
speaker
by
a,
a
oral
argument
or
by
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
at
any
rate,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
the
claim
that
sarivola
told
fulminante
that
his
life
was
in
danger?
there's
nothing
in
the
testimony?
unknown
speaker
but
what
do
you
understand
the
testimony
you
called
our
attention
to
mean?
you
have
to
tell
me
about
it
for
me
to
give
you
any
help.
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
what
they
mean
by
a
rough
time
in
prison?
they
call
you
names?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
with
his
friend
sarivola?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
do
you
think
that
if
you
had
the
choice
between
going
into
isolation
or
walking
around
freely
with
your
friend
sarivola,
you'd
say
i'd
rather
be
in
isolation?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
if
sarivola
is...
i
don't
know
if...
the
mystery
to
me
is
how
big
was
this
guy
anyway?
but
anyway--
[laughter]
--he
apparently
felt
perfectly
safe
when
he
was
with
sarivola.
and
then
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
he
should
have
run
and
said...
asked
the
warden
to
put
him
in
isolation
if
he's
already
got
all
the
protection
he
needs?
unknown
speaker
right.
