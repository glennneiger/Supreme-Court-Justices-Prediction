mr.
stephen
r.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
at
least
25
opinions
this
court
has
stated
that
a
conviction
can
never
stand
when
a
coerced
confession
has
been
admitted
at
trial.
and
the
court
has
stated
many
times
that
the
reason
for
this
is
that
no
civilized
system
of
justice
can
condone
the
use
of
a
coerced
confession.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
yes,
it
did.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
the
fact
that
the
informant,
mr.
sarivola,
told
mr.
fulminante
that
he
was
in
jeopardy...
his
life
was
in
jeopardy,
that
if
he
did
not
agree
to
confess
in
exchange
for
protection
that
mr.
sarivola
was
going
to
let
the
other
inmates
go
after
mr.
fulminante.
so
in
order
to
save
his
own
life,
mr.
fulminante
had
to
confess.
there
was
no
other
option.
so,
it
was
indeed
extremely
coercive.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
i
think
the
record
will
support
my
position.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
the
testimony
at
trial
was
also
that...
okay,
first
of
all
at
trial
the
coercion
involvement
confession
was
not
considered
greatly.
defense
counsel
did
not
pursue
that.
there
was--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
yes,
and
that
he
had
to
confess
in
order
to
be
protected.
the
stipulated
facts
are
enough
alone,
but
this
court
does
not
have
to
look
at
just
the
stipulated
facts.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
yes,
i
do.
but
this
court
can
also
consider
the
other
interviews
and
the
court
testimony.
and
it
was
clear
from
both...
or
from
the
informant,
mr.
sarivola,
that
indeed
he
did
require
a
confession
in
order
for
protection,
in
order
to
protect...
or
in
order
for
him
to
offer
protection
to
mr.
fulminante.
in
any
event,
this
court
has
held
that
no
matter
how
overwhelming
the
other
evidence
in
a
case,
even
if
there
are
other
valid
confessions,
even
when
there
have
been
five
other
valid
confessions,
that
a
coerced
confession
is
not
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis.
it
is
an
absolute
prohibition.
and
this
absolute
prohibition
reflects
the
original
intent
of
the
framers
of
our
constitution.
one
of
the
main
reasons--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--i
believe
it
is
not,
because
patrick
henry,
who
was
largely
responsible
for
the
passing
of
the
bill
of
rights,
stated
that
the
bill
of
rights
was
necessary
so
the
authorities
in
this
country
could
not
at
a
later
date
allow
the
practices
of
the
inquisitions
in
europe,
allow
coerced
confessions.
and
he
said
it
had
to
be
an
absolute
prohibition
in
the
fifth
amendment.
so,
he--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--did
not
specifically--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--he
is
the
one
that
advocated
having
a
bills
of
rights
and
was
largely
responsible--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--no,
he
did
not
sign
it,
but
he
is
the
one
that
insisted
and
was
largely
responsible
for
having
it
passed.
justice
frankfurter
in
culombe
v.
connecticut
discussed
the
fact
that
the
founders
of
our
country
were
well
aware
of
the
star
chamber
act
that
had
occurred
in
england
and
were
well
aware
of
the
inquisitions
that
had
occurred
on
the
continent
of
europe.
and
because
of
those
inquisitions,
the
framers
of
our
constitution
insisted
that
we
have
a
system
of
justice
based
on
accusation
and
independent
proof,
not
on
inquisition.
patrick
henry--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--i
think
the
bearing
that
perkins
v.
illinois
has
is
the
court
specifically
noted
there
that
the
conduct
was...
permissible
by
the
undercover
agent
because
there
was
no
coercion.
it
was
clear
that
this
court
held
or
was
stating
that
if
there
was
coercion,
it
would
be
a
different
situation,
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
we
do
have
coercion.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
uh,
sarivola
did
testify
that,
that
mr.
fulminante
was
in
danger
from
the
other
inmates
and
in
any
event
the
fact
that
mr.
sarivola
himself
told
mr.
fulminante
that
his
life
was
jeopardy
made
mr.
fulminante
believe
that
his
life
was
in
jeopardy.
so
he
had
to
confess.
so
subjectively
mr.
fulminante
had
to
be
in
fear.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
the
state
makes
that
claim
but
provides
no
evidence
to
support,
and
indeed
the
evidence
tends
to
show
it
was
not
a
viable
alternative.
when
mr.
fulminante
was
in
prison
previously,
he
could
not
psychologically
handle
the
isolation
of
protective
custody.
he
had
to
be
transferred
to
a
state
psychiatric
hospital
and
the
psychologist
at
that
hospital
determined
that
mr.
fulminante
should
remain
at
the
state
hospital
until
his
term
expired,
because
he
could
not
handle
being
sent
back
to
the
prison,
the
general
population,
or
to
protective
custody.
so
that
was
not
a
viable
alternative.
in
any
event,
stating
that
mr.
fulminante
could
seek
protective
custody
ignores
the
actually
setting
of
when
and
where
the
confession
occurred.
it
occurred
in
the
evening
in
the
prison
yard.
if
mr.
fulminante
had
not
confessed
immediately
that
evening,
quite
likely
he
would
not
have
made
it
out
of
the
prison
yard
alive.
that
evening
mr.
sarivola
came
over
to
mr.
fulminante
and
said,
your
life
is
in
jeopardy.
i
will
protect
you
from
the
other
inmates
if
you
confess.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
i
can't...
it
would
be
during
mr.
sarivola's
testimony.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
i
believe
those
were
the
exact
words:
your
life
is
in
jeopardy.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
you
have
to
realize
mr....
at
least
one
statement
mr.
sarivola
made.
mr.
sarivola
stated
six
different
ways
of
how
he
told
mr.
fulminante
that
he
had
to
confess.
but
one
of
them
was,
yes,
his
life
was
in
jeopardy.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
no,
i
don't.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
no,
i
do
not
think
so
at
all.
they
correctly
applied
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
they
relied
on
the
other
cases
since
bram
where
this
court
has
held
that
where
there
is
a
coerced
confession,
the
case
must
be
reversed,
automatic
reversal.
the
state
contends
that
the
state
of
arizona
was
relying
on
the
mere
promise
language
of
bram.
that
is
absolutely
incorrect.
it
is
taken
out
of
context.
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
they
cite
bram
only
for
the
language
"or
other
undue
influence".
they
underline
that
language.
they
specifically
do
not
underline
"a
promise".
the
arizona
supreme
court
clearly
did
not
hold
that
this
was
a
situation
in
which
there
was
a
promise.
they
considered
it
was
violence...
a
threat
of
violence.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
yes,
it
does.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
yes,
it
does.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
no,
i'm
not.
this
court
has
gone
in
other
cases
and
stated
that
not
every
promise,
however
slight,
is
an
inducement.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
or
any
inducement.
but
this
court
has
never
backed
off
since
bram
of
any
use
of
physical
coercion
to
obtain
a
confession.
this
is
not
just
a
mere
slight
promise
situation,
so
bram
is
still
applicable
today
as
far
as
physical
coercion.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
no,
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
with
bram,
but
when
you
get
to
the
threat
of
physical
violence
in
exchange
for
a
confession,
when
it
is
that
serious,
it
still
applies.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
the
situation
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
i--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--well,
many
courts
have
talked
about
a
violation
of
miranda
being
a
coerced
confession
and
that
was
part
of
the
problem
with
the
original
opinion
of
the
state
of
arizona...
the
supreme
court
of--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--arizona.
they
confused
and
coerced
confessions
that
are
in
violation
of
miranda
with
truly
coerced
confessions--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--such
as
we
have
here.
so
a
violation
of
miranda
is
not
what
i'm
considering
a
truly
coerced
confession,
no.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
if
it
determined
that
it
was
a
very
slight
promise.
it's
not
an
absolute
rule
that
every
slight
promise
requires
automatic
reversal.
that's
true,
but
this
is
not
a
slight
promise
case.
patrick
henry
stated
that
if
this
country
ever
came
to
condone
the
use
of
coercion
to
obtain
confessions,
that,
quote,
"we
are
then
lost
and
undone."
end
quote.
and
the
prohibition
against
the
use
of
coerced
confessions
was
of
such
importance
to
the
framers
of
our
constitution
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
written
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
at
any
criminal
proceeding
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
it
is
an
absolute
prohibition.
there
are
no
exceptions.
there
certainly
is
not
an
exception
saying,
unless
a
judge
later
determines
that
it
is
harmless
error.
and
it
is
difficult
to
envision
any
exception
that
would
have
more
horrified
the
framers
of
our
constitution
than
that
exception,
for
with
that
exception
it
allows
at
given
case
the
practices
of
the
inquisitions
in
europe
to
be
condoned
in
this
country
if
a
judge
or
a
panel
of
judges
later
determines
that
it
was
harmless
error.
in
other
words,
whether
the
use...
the
conduct
involved
in
coerced
confession
is
condemned
or
condoned
would
be
decided
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
the
framers
of
our
constitution
would
not
have
tolerated
that.
the
state
of
arizona
is
requesting
this
court
to
nullify
the
intentions...
the
original
intent
of
the
framers
of
our
constitution
in
considering
the
right
involved,
the
one
that
carries
as
much
weight
as
any
right
in
our
country.
it
would
be
expected
that
the
state
of
arizona
would
have
an
extremely
compelling
reason.
the
state
does
not.
the
only
reason
the
state
of
arizona
has
for
requesting
that
this...
that
harmless
error
analysis
be
applied,
is
so
the
state
of
arizona
does
not
have
to
retry
mr.
fulminante.
so,
the
state
of
arizona
does
not
have
to
give
mr.
fulminante
the
trial
that
the
state
deprived...
the
fair
trial...
that
the
state
deprived
him
of
in
the
first
place.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
i
believe
it
would
be
because
of
the
final
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
and
the
inconvenience
in
retrying
mr.
fulminante
carries
slight
weight
here,
because
a
retrial
would
take
less
than
2
weeks
and
if,
as
the
state
of
arizona
claims,
there
is
this
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt,
there
should
be
little
difficult...
difficulty
for
the
state
of
arizona.
and
the
state's
position
ignores
the
great
inconvenience
to
the
entire
judicial
system
if
this
court
abandons
the
bright-line
rule
that
a
conviction
cannot
stand
when
there
is
a
coerced
confession
at
trial.
if
this
court
abandons
that
rule,
then
the
appellate
court
will
not
just
be
reviewing
the
limited
portion
of
the
appellate
record
to
determine
if
there
actually
was
a
coerced
confession.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
that
is
correct
regarding
rights
carrying
lesser
value.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
to
an
extent
that
is
true.
this
right
is
of
the
highest
magnitude
in
our
society.
therefore,
the
state
needs
a
much
more
compelling
reason
than
they
would
need
as
far
as
harmless
error
analysis
being
applied
to
some
other
right
such
as
the
miranda--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--the
milton
v.
wainwright--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--yes,
it
was
relied
on
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
its
original
opinion.
that
is
how
they
got
into
trouble.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
the
dissenting
opinion
on
the
second
opinion
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
still
relied
on
milton
v.
wainwright,
saying
that
it
held
that
coerced
confessions
can
be
subject
to
the
harmless
error
doctrine.
well,
cases
since
milton
v.
wainwright
by
this
court
have
noted
that
it
only
dealt
with
sixth
amendment
rights
not
coerced
confessions.
and,
indeed,
it
would
be
rather
strange
that
if
milton
v.
wainwright
reversed
over
25
previous
cases
holding
that
harmless
error
doctrine
could
not
be
applied
to
coerced
confessions.
it
would
be
rather
strange
if
milton
v.
wainwright
does
not
discuss
one
single
case,
does
not
discuss
any
of
those
25
other
cases.
obviously,
if
it's
reversing
a
long
string...
a
long
line
of
cases.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
some
of
them
are
dicta.
many
of
them,
probably
a
dozen,
are
direct
holdings.
the
judicial...
the
inconvenience
to
the
judicial
system
would
be
great
because
when
weighing
harmless
error,
the
appellate
are
required
to
review
the
entire
record
on
appeal.
often
that
entails
thousands
of
pages.
it
is
a
lengthy
and
complex
process.
so
judicial
economy
dictates
against
the
state's
position.
now,
in
dozens
of
cases
involving
coerced
confessions
this
court
has
never
approved
of
the
conduct
involved
when
you
have
a
coerced
confession.
if
the
court
now
condones
that
conduct
by
applying
the
harmless
error
doctrine,
it
has
the
same
practical
consequences
as
if
the
court
approves
the
use
of
coerced
confessions.
as
this
court
has
stated
many
times
that
conduct
must
be
condemned.
to
do
otherwise
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
the
defendant,
who
is
denied
a
fair
trial.
it
undermines
public
confidence
in
the
entire
judicial
system,
because
it
has
the
appearance
that
the
courts
will
look
the
other
way
when
the
police
have
coerced
a
confession
from
a
suspect.
it
has
the
appearance
of
impropriety
because
it
appears
that
the
courts
will
look
the
other
way
when
do
not
enforce
or
when
the
police
violate
the
very
laws
that
they
are
to
enforce.
and
it
signals
to
the
police
that
is
they
have
a
suspect
but
insufficient
evidence
to
obtain
a
conviction,
they
have
nothing
to
lose
by
obtaining
a
coerced
confession.
the
conduct
may
later
be
condoned.
this
should
not
be
tolerated.
the
matter
presently
before
this
court
is
a
classic
case
of
the
threat
of
violence
being
used
to
overbear
the
free
will
of
a
suspect
who
previously
has
refused
to
confess.
in
1982,
anthony
sarivola
was
a
uniformed
police
officer
in
the
new
york
city
area.
he
was
also
working
for
the
columbo
organized
crime
family.
he
was
involved
in
loan
sharking.
he
used
violence
to
collect
payments
on
extortionate
loans
made
by
the
columbo
family.
because
of
this
activity,
in
the
fall
of
1982,
he
was
arrested
by
fbi
agent,
walter
ticano.
ticano
knew
of
sarivola's
extensive
and
violate
criminal
history.
ticano
knew
that
sarivola
was
a
corrupt
and
violent
man.
but
despite
this
fact,
ticano
chose
to
make
sarivola
a
paid
government
informant
and
sent
him
after
targeted
suspects.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
yes,
there
is
a
serious
possibility
that
he
could.
because
of
his
connections
with
organized
crime,
the
other
inmates
were
afraid
to
do
other
than
what
he
said.
also
because
of
his
power
on
a
powerful
prison
commission,
he
did--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--not
at
trial
but
at
the
hearing
i
believe
the
prosecutor
admitted
that
fact
and
in
the
interviews
that
is
discussed...
interviews
that
were
attached
to
a
motion
at
the
pretrial
hearing.
now,
agent
ticano
knew
that
sarivola
had
resorted
to
any
means
including
the
use
of
violence
to
obtain
payments
for
the
columbo
family.
ticano
also
knew
that
sarivola
would
resort
to
any
means
necessary
to
obtain
confessions
from
targeted
suspects,
that
is,
if
sarivola
was
paid
well
enough.
and
indeed
the
fbi
did
pay
sarivola
well.
so
it
is
entirely
predictable
that
once
oreste
fulminante
became
a
targeted
suspect
that
we
would
have
a
coerced
confession
in
this
case.
and
i'm
not
claiming
there
is
anything
wrong
with
using
undercover
agents...
using
government
informants.
that's
a
proper
police
procedure.
but
there
is
everything
wrong
when
the
government
sends
a
known
violent
criminal
after
a
citizen.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
well,
when
the
confession
was
made
to
donna
sarivola,
anthony
sarivola
was
also
present
then.
it
is
not
fleshed
out
in
the
record
how
much
of
that
effect
it
takes,
but
certainly
there
was
an
influence.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
i'm
afraid
legally
i
am
on
the
facts
i
disagree
with
how
the
arizona
supreme
court
ruled.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
i
think,
as
i
recall...
i
don't
recall
the
name
of
the
case
that
this
court
has
applied
it
in
similar
situations
to
that,
where--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--by
no
means.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
no
one
would
be
as
offended
by
the
fact
they
confessed,
because
a
lawyer
wasn't
next
to
him
as
they
would
if
their
very
life
was
endangered.
having
a
lawyer
is
nowhere
near
the
same
value
as
saving
your
life.
and
the
problem
with
fbi
agent
ticano's
conduct
in
this
case
is
that
no
citizen
can
truly
feel
safe
if
at...
if
at
ticano's
whim
he
could
send
sarivola,
a
violent
man,
against
any
citizen.
and
if
he
pays
sarivola
well
enough,
sarivola
is
going
to
obtain
a
confession
from
just
about
any
person.
now
for
all
of
his
extensive
and
violent
criminal
activity,
sarivola
received
a
total
sentence
of
60
days
in
prison,
and
he
was
serving
this
sentence
in
october
of
1983
when
he
met
another
inmate
named
oreste
fulminante.
rumors
were
spreading
through
the
prison
that
fulminante
had
murdered
his
stepdaughter.
because
of
those
rumors,
his
life
was
indeed
in
jeopardy.
the
other
inmates
wished
to
harm
him.
sarivola
told
ticano
of
the
rumors,
and
ticano
requested
that
sarivola
find
out
more
information.
so
sarivola
then
employed
the
guise
of
friendship
to
obtain
a
confession.
he
befriended
fulminante,
was
with
him
everyday
for
weeks
for
several
hours
everyday.
sarivola
on
numerous
occasions
asked
fulminante
if
he
committed
the
murder.
fulminante
continually
denied
any
involvement.
so
it
was
clear
that
sarivola's
attempt
at
deception
was
not
going
to
work.
with
2
weeks
left
before
sarivola
was
to
be
released
from
prison,
fbi
agent
ticano
made
a
personal
visit
to
the
prison
and
specifically
told
sarivola,
quote,
"get
me
the
whole
story",
end
quote.
clearly,
sarivola
wanted
a
confession.
and
within
hours
of
this
directive,
sarivola
did
get
a
confession.
it
was
better
than
24-hour
service.
now
that
same
evening
after
the
personal
visit
by
ticano,
sarivola
approached
fulminante
in
the
prison
yard.
and,
again,
he
reminded
him
that
his
life
was
jeopardy,
that
he
had
to
confess
in
order
to
get
protection.
now
the
state
of
arizona
has
conceded
that
this...
in
their
briefs...
that
this
conduct
was
extremely
or
was
objectively
coercive.
however--
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
--yes,
it
would
be
during
sarivola's
testimony.
i
believe
approximately
page
12
or
so
of
his
testimony.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
now
the
state
claims
that
even
though
objectively
we
have
coercive
conduct
that
this
court
should
find
that
it
was
not
coercive
for
the
fact
that
mr.
fulminante
did
not
testify
that
he
was
in
fear.
well,
first
of
all,
this
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
state.
mr.
fulminante
is
not
required
to
produce
any
evidence.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
yes,
this
court
has
held
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
indeed
on
the
state.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
well,
to
prove
that
the
conduct
was
coercive
the
burden
was
on
the
state.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
oh,
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
that
is
their
burden
to
prove
that
it
is
not
coercive.
i'm
sorry,
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
r.
collins
not
coerced.
yes.
now
the
state's
argument
also
ignores
this
court's
holding
in
lee
v.
mississippi
in
which
the
defendant
denied
confessing,
but
the
court
still
held
that
the
confession
was
coerced.
this
court
held
to
do
otherwise
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
the
main
flaw
with
the
state's
argument
is
it
ignores
the
facts
themselves.
there
was
no
reason
for
sarivola
to
approach
mr.
fulminante,
tell
him
his
life
was
in
danger,
offer
protection
unless
he
was
trying
to
obtain
a
confession.
indeed,
you
should
consider
the
relationship
that
sarivola
had
with
ticano
because
of
the
informant
relationship.
sarivola
had
the
motive,
intent,
and
certainly
the
plan
to
obtain
a
confession.
it
was
not
an
accident
or
a
mere
coincidence,
as
the
state
claims,
that
mr.
sarivola
just
mentioned
the
fact
of
mr.
fulminante's
life
being
in
danger
and
the
fact
that
he
needed
protection.
and
there's
no
conceivable
reason
in
this
case
why
mr.
fulminante
would
have
continually
denied
any
involvement
in
this
murder
for
over
a
year
and
why
he
had
denied
for
weeks
any
involvement
to
mr.
sarivola
despite
constant
questioning.
there
is
only
one
conceivable
reason
why
mr.
fulminante
confessed
and
that
be...
and
that
was
because
he
was
in
fear.
and
indeed
an
order
to
avoid
torture
or
death
any
person,
whether
innocent
or
guilty,
in
mr.
fulminante's
situation
would
have
confessed.
as
the
arizona
supreme
court
correctly
held,
quote,
"this
is
a
coerced
confession
in
every
sense
of
the
word."
end
quote.
the
framers
of
our
constitution
would
never
have
allowed
the
use
of
this
coerced
confession.
they
certainly
would
not
have
done
so
merely
to
save
the
state
of
arizona
the
inconvenience
of
giving
mr.
fulminante
a
fair
trial.
there
has
been
no
change
in
our
society
that
today
compels
us
to
abandon
one
of
our
most
fundamental
protections
under
the
bill
of
rights.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
sit
down.
