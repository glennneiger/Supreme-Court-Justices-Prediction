mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
my
it
please
the
court:
the
rule
of
automatic
reversal
applied
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
this
case
is
an
anachronism.
it
was
adopted
at
a
time
when
rules
of
automatic
reversal
were
the
only
ones
known
to
the
law.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
is.
it
is
still
the
law
today.
in
that
respect
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
correct.
the
arizona
supreme
court
initially
ruled
that
it
was
legally
permissible
to
find
that
the
error
in
this
case
was
factually
harmless.
on
reconsideration
they
changed
only
the
first
half
of
that
ruling.
in
fact,
if
you
look
to
page
c2
in
the
petition
appendix,
the
arizona
supreme
court
lists
all
the
claims
that
were
made
in
the
rehearing
petition.
one
of
them
was
that
the
error
was
not
factually
harmless
and
that,
as
my
colleague
has
pointed
out,
was
among
the
claims
that
was
rejected
on
rehearing.
so
what
we
have
before
you
then,
your
honor,
is
a
case
in
which
the
only
reason
the
arizona
supreme
court
held
this
error
to
be
prejudicial
was
it
felt
that
this
court's
precedence
foreclosed
it
from
giving
effect
to
its
finding
that
the
error
was
harmless
as
a
factual
matter.
since
chapman
v.
california
20
years
ago
first
held
that
harmless
error
analysis
can
apply
to
constitutional
violations,
this
court
has
often
made
clear
that
the
harmless
error
doctrine
is
in
fact
the
rule
and
no
longer
the
exception.
the
law,
therefore,
generally
speaking,
is
the
exact
opposite
of
where
the
law
stood
in
1897
when
the
bram
case
was
decided.
it
is
bram
in
fact
that
is
the
source
of
the
rule
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
invoked
in
this
case
and
bram
in
fact
describes
the
only
category
of
evidence
that
is
today
automatically
and
in
every
case
excepted
from
harmless
error
analysis.
interest...
interestingly--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
on
the...
on
the
question
of
whether
the
statement
to
anthony
sarivola
was
in
fact
coerced,
they
said--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--they
said
that
they
were
applying
the
totality
of
circumstances
test.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
on
that
issue,
the
first
issue
in
this
case,
what
they
treated
as
decisive,
was
the
fact
that
there
was
an
offer
of
protection
made
and
they
treated
as
dispositive,
the
ruling
in
the
other
half
of
the
bram
case,
that
when
such
an
offer
is
made
of
any
type,
a
confession
is
necessarily
involuntary.
so
actually
the
arizona
supreme
court
invoked
both
halves
of
the
bram
decision
in
this
case
to
upset
the
conviction,
the
first
half
being
that
any
offer
renders
a
statement
involuntary,
the
second
half
being
that
any
involuntary
statement
has
to
require
a
reversal.
now,
interestingly,
neither
respondent
nor
supporting
amicus
defends
the
rationale
given
in
the
bram
case
for
that
rule,
and
we
think
they're
right
not
to
do
so.
bram
rested
on
a
perceived
logical
contradiction
between
the
propositions
that
a
particular
item
of
evidence
could
be
at
once
probative
and
yet
harmless.
in
fact
today,
under
modern
principles
of
appellate
review,
there
is
no
longer
any
such
contradiction.
a
particular
piece
of
evidence
can
be
probative
if
it
has
any
tendency
to
prove
or
disprove
a
matter
in
issue.
but
the
same
piece
of
evidence
can
in
fact
be
harmless
if
it
is
generally
insignificant
in
the
context
of
the
entire
record.
and
it
is
in
the
context
of
the
entire
record
that
the
harmlessness
determination
must
be
made,
while
it
is
in
the
context
of
that
particular
piece
of
evidence
that
the
relevancy
determination
must
be
made.
in
fact,
under
present
principles
of
appellate
review,
the
contradiction
that
troubled
the
court
in
bram
exists
only
when
a
particular
item
of
evidence
is
the
sole
proof
of
a
disputed
issue
in
the
case.
in
all
other
circumstances
the
contradiction
does
not
exist.
the
question
then
becomes
whether
there
is
any--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
bram
didn't
have
before
it
the
rule
that
harmless
errors
could
be
overlooked.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
i
think
it
saw
it
because
any
piece
of
evidence,
whether
or
not
it
was
a
confession,
would
lead
to
that
type
of
contradiction.
in
other
words,
they...
the
court
in
bram
thought
that
it
was
contradictory
for
a
prosecutor
to
argue
to
the
trial
court
that
this
evidence
proves
the
defendant
is
guilty
and
then
argue
to
an
appellate
court
that
the
same
evidence
doesn't
prove
he's
guilty
or
at
least
didn't
have
any
prejudicial
effect
because
there
was
plenty
of
other
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
we
think
the
error
in
this
case
was
factually
harmless
and
that
the
court
in
this
case
should
use
this
vehicle
for
saying
that
errors
like
this
should
no
longer
be
excepted
from
the
harmless
error--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i'm
not--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
we're
not...
we're
not
in
this
case
interested
in
the
particulars
of
this
particular
judgment,
if
that's--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
in
every
case
where
any
erroneously
admitted
evidence
is
harmless
you
will
automatically
have
the
verdict
stand.
if
that's
what...
if
that's
what
you're
getting
at
then
i
would
certainly
agree.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
sure.
and
that...
that's
the
sort
of
inquiry
that's--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
i
mean,
the
assumption
you
have
to
make
is
the
jury
is
going
to
be
rational.
that's
the
type
of
assumption
you
have
to
make--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--absolutely.
well,
i
would
certainly
concede--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--they
did...
they
did
not
consider
whether
the
means
by
which
the
confession
was
obtained
affected
the...
inquiry
into
prejudice.
and
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
what
you're
talking
about
is
a
question--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes.
what
you're
talking
about
is
a
question
of
deterrence.
applying
a
harmless
error
rule
is
not
likely
to
lead
to
an
increased
number
of
coerced
confessions,
because
no
police
officer
at
the
time
he
is
deciding
whether
and
how
to
question
someone--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
this
court
is
certainly
better
able
to
decide
whether
generally
speaking
such
errors
can
be
harmless,
because
this
court
is
the
only
court
that
has
the
power
to
overrule
the
bram
case,
which
the
arizona
supreme
court
didn't.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
way
that
we
know
what
goes
on
is
to
rely
on
the
find--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
it's
to
rely
on
the
findings
made
by
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
court.
it
is
true
a
great
many
confessions
will
be
prejudicial,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
every
confession
will
be
prejudicial.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
have
several
responses.
first,
in
the
milton
and
satterwhite
cases
the
court
said
that
confessions
obtained
in
violations
of
the
sixth
amendment
can
be
harmless.
there's
no
material
difference
between
a
sixth
amendment
and
a
fifth
amendment
violation
if
the
question
is
whether
the
defendant
was
prejudiced.
the
question
of
prejudice
doesn't
focus
on
the
label
given
to
the
violation.
it
focuses
on
the
substance
of
the
statement
and
the
context
in
which
a
statement
is
made,
which
is
the
remaining
evidence
in
a
case.
in
either
case,
the
question
is
was
this
error
likely
to
have
had
a
material
effect
on
the
jury.
i
agree.
the
question
is
whether
this
jury
was
prejudiced,
whether
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
before
this
jury
by
the
error.
that's
not,
i
think,
different
from
the
answer
i
gave
to
justice
stevens,
because
generally
what
you're
trying
to
decide
is
what
a
reasonable
jury
would
have
taken
in
response
to
this
sort
of
mix
of
evidence
before
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
but
the
same
argument,
your
honor,
could
be
made
in
response
to
any
erroneously
admitted
evidence,
and
the
court
has
held
in
numerous
cases
throughout
the
past
2
decades,
that
erroneously
admitted
evidence
is
a
classic
example
of
where
the
harmless
error
rule
should
apply,
because
the
record
is
before
the
appellate
court.
there's
no
inquiry
that
has
to
made
into
what
should
have
been
put
into
the
record.
you
have
the
entire
record.
and
you
can
have
cases
where
there
is
an
eyewitness
identification,
where
there
is
testimony
by
confederates
who've
now
turned
state's
evidence,
where
there
is
videotaped
testimony.
in
the...
once
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
brown
v.
the
united
states.
there
was
a
bruton
violation
but
the
police
had
pictures
of
the
defendant
committing
the
crime.
it's
impossible,
i
think,
to
say
in
those
sort
of
circumstances
that
a
reasonable
jury
would
automatically
have
said,
the
confession
is
all
i
need
to
look
at.
i
can
just
disregard
the
rest
of
the
evidence.
our
submission
in
this
case
simply
asks
the
court
on
this
issue
to
say
that
appellate
courts
in
the
state
and
federal
system
should
be
free
to
look
into
that
question.
we're
not
saying
every
confession
will
be
nonprejudicial.
we're
just
saying
they
should
be
allowed
to
make
the
inquiry.
thank
you.
