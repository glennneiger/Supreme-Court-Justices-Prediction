justice
byron
r.
white
as
the
chief
justice
indicates,
the
arizona
against
fulminante
is
another
cattle
of
fish.
the
respondent,
fulminante,
was
convicted
of
murder
and
sentenced
to
death
in
an
arizona
state
court.
at
his
trial,
a
confession
by
respondent
to
a
felony
made
in
prison
was
introduced
in
evidence
over
his
objection
that
the
confession
was
coerced.
on
appeal,
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
that
the
confession
was
coerced
and
inadmissible
in
evidence,
but
held
that
its
introduction
was
harmless
error.
on
reconsideration,
however,
the
court
held
that
in
light
of
the
united
states
supreme
court's
decisions
on
the
issue,
no
harmless
error
rule
was
inapplicable
to
coerce
confessions.
the
court
therefore,
reversed
the
conviction
and
ordered
a
new
trial.
we
granted
certiorari.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
for
the
court
agreeing
with
the
arizona
court
that
the
confession
was
coerced
and
inadmissible,
and
holding
that
even
if
a
harmless
error
rule
is
applicable
to
coerced
confessions,
as
the
chief
justice's
opinion
to
be
announced
will
hold,
the
error
in
this
case
was
not
harmless.
fulminante's
conviction,
therefore,
cannot
stand
and
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
affirmed.
i
filed
with
the
clerk
a
three-part
opinion
in
this
case.
in
the
first
part,
i
have
expressed
the
dissenting
opinion
that
the
facts
presented
in
this
case
do
not
support
the
contention
that
fulminante's
confession
was
rendered
involuntary
because
of
the
conduct
of
law
enforcement
officials.
that
section
has
been
joined
by
justices
o'connor,
kennedy,
and
souter.
in
the
second
part,
i
did
deliver
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
the
harmless
error
rule
adapted
by
this
court
in
chapman
against
california
is
applicable
to
the
admission
of
involuntary
confession.
this
section
has
been
joined
by
justices
o'connor,
scalia,
kennedy,
and
souter.
the
admission
of
such
a
confession
is
a
trial
error
which
occurs
during
a
case's
presentation
to
the
trier
of
fact
and
may,
therefore,
be
quantitatively
assessed
in
the
context
of
other
evidence
presented
in
order
to
determine
whether
its
admission
is
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
this
respect,
a
trial
error
differs
markedly
from
violations
that
are
in
effect
structural
defects
in
the
trial
mechanism,
such
as
a
biased
judge
or
the
complete
depravation
of
counsel
which
we
have
recognized
are
not
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis.
and
our
holding
today
is
consistent
with
our
earlier
decisions
that
confessions
obtained
in
violation
of
other
constitutional
guarantees
are
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis
since
those
confessions
have
the
same
evidentiary
impact
and
may
have
been
elicited
by
equally
egregious
conduct.
in
the
third
and
final
part
of
my
opinion,
i
have
expressed
the
dissenting
view
that
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
in
its
initial
opinion,
properly
concluded
that
the
admission
of
fulminante's
confession
was
harmless.
this
section
has
been
joined
by
justices
o'connor
and
scalia.
and
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
marshall,
justice
blackmun,
and
justice
stevens
and
i
disagree
with
the
opinion
just
announced
that
the
harmless
error
rule
is
applicable
to
coerced
confessions.
in
1963,
justice
stewart,
writing
for
unanimous
court
in
line
against
illinois,
rejected
as
impermissible
doctrine
the
notion
that
the
admission
of
a
coerced
confession
could
be
harmless
error.
this
announcement
was
nothing
new
for
it
reflected
the
views
consistently
expressed
in
the
court's
prior
cases,
and
it
is
a
view
that
until
today
was
consistently
followed
by
our
decisions
dealing
with
coerced
confessions.
in
deed,
we
have
thought
it
actually
emetic
that
a
conviction
resting
in
whole
or
in
part
on
an
involuntary
confession
could
not
stand
regardless
of
the
other
evidence
of
guilt.
and
in
chapman
against
california,
from
which
today's
decision
is
said
to
derive,
we
said
that
while
some
constitution
of
violations
could
be
treated
as
harmless
error.
certain
constitutional
rights
are
so
basic
to
a
fair
trial
that
their
infraction
can
never
be
deemed
harmless.
in
the
chapman
opinion
placed
in
that
category,
the
admission
at
trial
of
a
defendant's
coerced
confession.
the
reasons
for
the
rule
are
simple;
confessions
are
very
likely
the
most
damaging
in
providing
evidence.
jurors
have
difficulty
ignoring
them
even
if
told
to
do
so.
and
confessions
extracted
by
physical
or
mental
coercion
are
not
always
trustworthy
evidence.
beyond
that,
however,
the
rule
has
served
as
a
constant
reminder
to
law
enforcement
officers
that
ours
is
not
an
inquisitorial
system
of
criminal
justice,
and
that
the
courts
will
not
put
up
with
unconstitutional
methods
of
securing
confessions.
the
four
of
us
believe
the
court
is
quite
wrong
in
discarding
the
salutary
rule
and
hence,
with
all
due
respect,
we
dissent.
