ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
separate
issues,
a
voluntariness
issue
regarding
a
confession
and
a
harmless
error
issue.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
i
do
not
know
if
the
court
will
need
to
decide
both
of
these,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
that
is
correct.
i
will
be
addressing
the
voluntariness
issue,
and
mr.
larkin
from
the
solicitor
general's
office
will
be
addressing
the
harmless
error
issue.
at
oreste
fulminante's
trial
for
first-degree
murder,
two
separate
confessions
were
introduced
to
him
over
his
objection.
the
first
was
a
confession
that
he
made
while
he
was
incarcerated
in
a
federal
prison.
he
made
the
first
confession
to
a
fellow
inmate,
who
was
in
reality
an
fbi
informant.
the
second
confession
mr.
fulminante
made
was
6
months
after
the
first
one.
it
was
after
he
had
been
released
from
the
federal
prison
and
was
no
longer
an
inmate.
he
made
this
confession
to
donna
sarivola,
who
was
at
that
time
mr.
sarivola's
fiancee.
they
were
shortly
thereafter
married.
prior
to
trial,
mr.
fulminante
filed
his
motion...
voluntariness
motion
for
a
hearing.
there
was
a
jackson
v.
denno
hearing
in
the
trial
court,
but
no
witnesses
were
called
at
this
hearing.
the
defense
agreed
to
the...
a
stipulated
set
of
facts
that
were
set
forth
in
the
prosecutor's
trial
response.
the
trial
court
ruled
on
the
voluntariness
issue
and
other
issues
regarding
both
of
these
confessions
based
upon
oral
argument
by
the
parties
and
the
stipulated
facts.
the
court
ruled
that
the
first
confession,
the
one
to
the
inmate
informant,
was
voluntarily
made.
the
court
specifically
found
it
was
not
the
result
of
any
promises,
threats,
or
coercion
by
any
government
agent.
the
court
found
it
was
fully
voluntary.
the
court
also
found
that
the
second
confession
to
the
inmate
informant's
wife
was
also
voluntarily
made
and
was
not
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree,
as
the
defendant
argued.
on
direct
appeal,
after
mr.
fulminante
had
been
convicted
of
first-degree
murder,
on
his
direct
appeal,
he
re-raised
the
voluntariness
question.
he
claimed
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
this...
this
confession
to
the
inmate
informant
had
in
fact
been
coerced
by
a
promise
of
protection.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
the
court
did
consider
the
evidence
at
trial,
and
i
believe
it
was
proper
for
the
court
to
do
so.
the
arizona
court
has
always,
as
a
matter
of
arizona
law,
whether
it's
constitutionally
required
or
not,
has
looked
to
the
entire
trial
record
in
determining
whether
a
confession
is
coerced.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
would
be
proper
for
this
court
to
also
examine
the
entire
record,
which
is
what--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
only
deference
that
this
court
owes
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
regarding
the
coerced
confession
is
to
the
facts,
the
underlying
facts
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
in
regard
to
the
confession.
the
question
whether
the
confession
was
actually
coerced
is
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
which
this
court
should
resolve
with
a...
due
deference
to
the
arizona
supreme
court's
findings
that--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree,
and
one
reason
i
disagree
is
that
the
arizona
court
determined
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
fulminante
was
in
danger
while
in
prison.
and
this
is
not
borne
out
by
the
record.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record,
and
this
is
from
sarivola's
trial
testimony,
is
that
it
is
possibly
a
prison...
or
a
prisoner
who
is
known
to
have
killed
a
child
or
be
a
child
murderer
would
be
in
danger
while
in
prison.
this
was
not
a
stipulated
fact
that
was
before
the
trial
judge
when
he
made
his
finding,
and
there
is
simply
no
evidence
in
the
regarding
that
particular
fact,
so
that
is
why
the
state
contends
that
the
arizona's
court's
finding
of
involuntariness
is
based
in
a
large
part
upon
its
finding
that
this
promise
of
protection
was
so
incredibly
coercive
because
mr.
fulminante
was
in
actual
danger
while
it
was
in
prison.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
that
is
a
portion
of
the
record.
that
was
not
part
of
the
evidence
before
the
trial
judge.
a
portion
of
his
interview
with
the
defense
counsel
prior
to
trial
was
attached
to
one
of
the
pleadings,
and
he
did
speculate
in
that
particular
portion
of
the
interview
that
that
was
his
feeling.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
no.
the
defense
attorney
at
trial
never
asked
him
whether
mr.
fulminante
was
in
actual
danger
or
asked
him
his
feelings
about
the
danger
to
fulminante.
and
the
only
evidence
that
there
was
even
a
remote
possibility
was
that
there
was
a
stipulated
fact
that
fulminante
had
been
receiving
some
sort
of
rough
treatment
and
what-not
is
the
phrase
sarivola
used
from
the
other
prisoners,
but
no
one
ever
asked
fulminante
or
sarivola
what
this
rough
treatment
consisted
of.
and
the
record
is
just
unclear
on
that.
but
in
any
event,
he...
fulminante
did
not
ask
sarivola
for
protection.
he
never
indicated
that
he
was
in
need
of
protection,
and
even
after
sarivola
made
this
offer
of
protection
to
him,
he
merely
told
him
about
the
murder
during
their
casual
conversation
without
saying
now
are
you
going
to
help
me?
so,
that
is
the
reason
that
i
believe
that
this
court
should
not
defer
to
the
arizona
supreme
court's
finding
of
the
law
in
regard
to
the
voluntariness
without
first
reexamining
the
record
to
see
if
there
is
any
evidence
of
actual
danger
to
fulminante.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
that
is
a
fair
statement,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
that
is
all
in
the
record,
your
honor.
in
regard
to
the
state's
contention
that
the
arizona
court
not
only
ruled
incorrectly
on
the
involuntariness
issue,
it
is
the
state's
contention
that
the
court
actually
applied
an
incorrect
standard
in
ruling
on
the
voluntariness
issue.
the
court
in
effect
found
a
promise
resulting
in
a
confession
and
stated
that
it
was
a
coerced
confession
without
ever
examining
one
of
the
most
important
facts
or
one
of
the
most
important
circumstances
in
the
case,
whether
fulminante
was
a
person
whose
will
could
easily
be
overborne
by
a
promise
of
promise
of
protection.
when
fulminante's
character
is
examined
it
is
very
clear
that
he
is
not
such
a
person.
when
he
made
this
admission
to
sarivola,
he
went
into
great
detail
about
the
terrible
way
in
which
he
had
killed
his
young
stepdaughter,
and
he
used
the
phrase
that
he
had
clipped
her.
he
did
not,
you
know,
show
any
remorse
or,
or
anything
of
that
nature.
he
went
into
the
details
and
there's
a
finding
by
the
arizona
court
that,
and
this
is
in
appendix
to
the
petition
at
a76,
the
trial
court
found
in
its
special
verdict
in
this
matter
that
these
were
the
statements
of
a
man
who
was
bragging
and
relishing
the
crime
committed.
so,
the
arizona
court
on
one
hand
finds
that
this
person
was
person
was
compelled
to
confess.
but
on
the
other
hand,
finds...
makes
a
finding
that
he
is
bragging
and
relishing
at
the
time
that
he's
actually
confessing
that.
that
is
simply--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--this
is
a
finding
by
the
trial
court,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
that
is
correct.
the
trial--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--i
disagree
respectfully,
your
honor,
because
this
language
by
the
trial
court
in
the
special
verdict
about
him
bragging
and
relishing--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--was
affirmed
on
appeal.
the
arizona
court
basically
adopted
that
finding
regarding
his
state
of
mind
at
the
time
he
was
confessing
by
affirming
the
trial
court's--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--they
do
quote
this
language
in
the
opinion--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--which
is...
i
was
referring
to
the
opinion
at
a76.
that
is
a
portion
of
their
opinion
in
which
they
quote
the
trial
court's
finding.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
and
in
regard
to,
to--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
it
was
in
connection
with
that.
in
looking
at
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
determining
whether
fulminante's
state
of
mind
was
such
that
he
could
have
been
coerced
by
a
promise
into
confessing,
the
court
has
to
look
not
only
at
the
fact
that
he
did
confess
in
response
to
the
promise
but
at
his
characteristics.
and,
as
noted
in
the
briefs,
he's
a
middle-aged
sociopath.
he's
low
to
low-average...
or
low-to-average
intelligence.
he
had
absolutely
no
mental
or
physical
problems
that
would
have
made
him
especially
susceptible
to
coercion.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
this
pre-sentence
report
indicates
anywhere
from
5
foot
3
to
5
foot
5
and
around
120
pounds,
so--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--i'm
not
aware.
i...
that
didn't...
as
far
as
i'm
aware
that
did
not
come
out
in--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--yes,
he
was.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
going
back
to
mr.
fulminante's
characteristics.
he
had
been
in
prison
before.
this
was
the
third
time
he
was
in
prison.
he
had
six
prior
felony
convictions
and,
interestingly
enough,
the
first
time
he
was
in
prison
as
a
young
man
at
age
26,
when
he
felt
fear
of
other
inmates,
all
he
did
was
ask
to
be
put
in
protective
custody
and
it
was
done.
there
is
simply
nothing
to
indicate
that
if
he
was
actually
in
fear,
he
could
have
done
that
in
this
case.
none
of
the
prison
authorities
were
apparently
aware
that
he
was
receiving
any
kind
of
treatment,
or
this
rough
treatment
was
certainly
not
bad
enough
that
he
would
complain
to
authorities.
and
another
aspect
of
mr.
fulminante's
character
and
part
of
the
whole
circumstances
of
this
case
are
his
relationship
with
this
prison
informant.
he
wanted
to
be
like
sarivola.
he
wanted
to
become
involved
in
organized
crime
and
although...
unbeknownst
to
him...
sarivola
was
acting
as
an
informant,
to
mr.
fulminante's
knowledge,
he
was
still
actively
involved
in
organized
crime.
and
fulminante,
after
becoming
acquainted
with
sarivola,
actually
agreed
to
commit
some
contract
killings
after
his
release
from
prison.
so
this
is
the
man
that
he
wants
to
work
for.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
none
of
them
were
taped,
your
honor.
they
were...
they
were
made
in
the
prison.
sarivola
was
not
wearing
a
mike.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
yes.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
and
also
there
was
the
second
confession,
which
was
also
not
taped,
but
which
was
made
to
the...
donna
sarivola
later.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
to
donna
sarivola,
the--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--that's
correct.
the
prison
informant's
wife.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
no,
your
honor,
other
than
the
inducement
that
donna
sarivola
inquired
of
mr.
fulminante
when
he
got
in
the
car
to
drive
to
pennsylvania,
well,
why
aren't
you
going
back
to
arizona,
don't
you
have
family
there.
whereupon
he
launched
into
this
diatribe
about
the
young
child
he
had
killed
there
and
the
terrible
things
he
did
to
her.
so
it
was
certainly
not
the
result
of
any
sort
of
inducement.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
yes,
they
did,
your
honor,
and
in
their
opinion
they
determined
that
it
was
not
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
that
was
fully
litigated
both
at
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
ruled
against
mr.
fulminante
on
that
and
it
was
relitigated
in
the
direct
appeal.
the
arizona
court
found
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
too
attenuated.
it
was
6
months
later
after
he
was
no
longer
in
need
of
any
kind
of
protection.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
it
did,
however,
the
court
did
look
at
that
question
again,
because
it
was
raised
in
the
defendant's
motion
for
reconsideration
and
the
court
in
its
second...
in
its
supplemental
opinion
specifically
rejected
that
claim
again,
saying
none
of
his
other
claims
are
any
good,
just
this
one
regarding
harmless
error.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
thank
you.
i'll
reserve
my
time.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
briefly
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to
page
63
of
the
joint
appendix...
excuse
me,
page
83
of
the
joint
appendix
is
the
trial
testimony
of
anthony
sarivola
in
which
he
testifies
that
after
he
and
the
defendant
are
walking
on
the
track
and
after
the
defendant,
fulminante,
has
been
receiving
rough
treatment,
sarivola
tells
him,
you
have
to
tell
me
about
it
in
order
for
me
to
give
you
any
help.
that
is
the
sum
total
of
this
promise
of
protection,
the
implied
promise
of
protection
which
fulminante
claims
was
so
incredibly
coercive.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
your
honor,
that
is
not
reflected
any
place
in
the
record
that
i
am
aware
of.
the
only
reference--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--no,
not
as
reflected
in
sarivola's
testimony.
there
is
one
reference
in
the
record
to
that,
but
it
was
made
during
oral
argument
on
the
voluntariness
motion.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
yes,
the
prosecutor
did
indicate
he
was
paraphrase
something
of
sarivola's
and
paraphrased
it
in
that
manner,
but
it
is
the
state's
position
that
it
was
not
any
kind
of
concession.
he
may
have
misspoke
himself
about
that.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
nothing
in
the
testimony,
your
honor,
either
the
stipulated
statement
of
facts
or
in
the
sarivolas'
testimony.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
it
means
that
if
fulminante
needs
help
from
the
other
prisoners
who
are
giving
him
the
rough
time,
then
he
can
call
on
sarivola.
but
there's
no
indication,
your
honor,
that
this
rough
time
that
fulminante
was
receiving
was
in
fact
any
sort
of
physical
thing
that
was
being
done
to
him.
there's
no
indication
that
other
than
perhaps
ostracizing
him
and
ignoring
him
that
the
other
prisoners
are
doing
anything
to
him.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
well,
your
honor,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
otherwise
in
this
case,
and
it's
certainly
did
not
deter
fulminante
from
taking
his
evening
stroll
around
the
track
with
his
friend
sarivola,
so--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
he
had
truly
been
in
danger,
he
would
have
perhaps
been
seeking
help
from
prison
authorities.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
well,
that's
a
choice
he
had
to
make.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
good
point,
your
honor.
he
did
have
that
choice.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
and
as
defense
counsel
has--
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
--well,
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
he
had
a
choice
if
he's...
to
a...
he
could
have
continued
to
deny
that
he
committed
this
crime.
ms.
barbara
m.
jarrett
he's
not
compelled
to
confess
to
this.
he
had
the
choice.
sarivola
is
saying,
tell
me
what
happened
and
i'll
protect
you,
but
if
you
don't
tell
me,
there
was
no
threat
that
anything
would
be
done
to
him,
that
he
would
be
in
any
danger
from
sarivola.
ms.
barbara
m.
