justice
souter
isn't...
i
guess
i
have
two
questions
about
your
argument.
the
first
is,
when
the
lsd
is
placed
on
the
blotter
paper,
it
bears
the
same
relationship
to
the
blotter
paper
that
the
cocaine
does
to
the
cutting
agent,
doesn't
it?
because
it's
no
longer
possible
at
least
without
sophisticated
chemical
reductions
to
distinguish
between
the
drug
and
the
substance
that
it
is
associated
with,
whereas
when
you're
dealing
with
bottles
or
suitcases
or
automobiles,
that
is
not
true.
so
that
in
that
respect,
the
analogy
between
the
blotter
paper
and
the
cutting
agent
for
cocaine
is
in
fact
a
legitimate
analogy,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
well,
that...
i
guess
that
gets
to
the
second
question
i
wanted
to
ask,
and
it's
something
that
you
came
close
to
in
responding
to
one
of
justice
scalia's
questions.
it
is
the...
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
that
without
the
combination
of
the
lsd
and
the
blotter
paper
or
the
sugar
cube...
whatever
it
may
be...
as
a
practical
matter
you
could
not
distribute
the
lsd
in
commercial
or
at
least
in...
in
consumable
form,
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
amount
of
lsd
that
is
necessary,
and
indeed
i
guess
even
possible
for
the
effect
that
the
users
want
to
get
out
of
it,
is
so
tiny
that
if
you
sold
them
tubes
or
jars
of
lsd,
they
simply
could
not
use
the
lsd
in
that
form.
so
that
if
you've
got
tubes
and
jars
of
it,
you've
got
something
which
in
that
form
simply
cannot
be
commercially
used.
and
the
only
way
you
can
commercially
use
it
is
to
combine
it
with
blotter
paper
or
sugar
cubes.
and
in
that
sense,
by
making
that
combination,
you
do
make
it
more
broadly
distributable
than
it
would
be
without
the
combination.
and
that
is
exactly
the
same
thing
that
goes
on
when
the
cocaine
is
cut
with
whatever
it's
combined
with.
isn't
that
true?
justice
souter
well,
you...
as
a
practical
matter
you
couldn't
sell
it
on
the
street
without
doing
that,
could
you?
justice
souter
but
if
that
were
the
only
way
you
could
sell
lsd,
the
market
for
lsd
would...
would
be
considerably
less,
wouldn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
well,
no...
no
one
is
saying
here
that
if
you
put
the
blotter
paper
in
a
paper
bindle
or
an
envelop
that
you're
going
to
weigh
the
envelop.
i
mean
that's
the
analogy
to
the...
to
the
cocaine,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
for
the...
for
the
simple
reason
that
you
can
easily
distinguish
in
your
analogy...
in
your
example
you
can
easily
distinguish
between
the
cocaine
and
the
blotter
paper.
and
you
can't
easily
distinguish
between
the
lsd
and
the
blotter
paper.
and
by
the
same
token,
the
blotter
paper
is
used
as
a
means
of
ingestion
in
the
lsd
case.
it
is
not
used
as
a
means
of
ingestion
in
your
example.
justice
souter
but...
but
there
is
a
correlation
between
the
means
used
to
prepare
something
for
ingestion
and
the
breadth
of
its
potential
distribution.
and
that
is
what
congress
was
getting
at.
and
that
seems
to
me
just
as
true
in
the
lsd
in
relation
to
the
blotter
paper
as
it
is
of
the
cocaine
in
relation
to
whatever
substance
it
is
mixed
with.
justice
souter
so
you're...
you...
you're
saying
that
for
purposes
of
the
statute
that...
there
cannot
be
a
mixture
unless
the
medium
of
mixing
can
be
varied
in
such
a
way
as
to
dilute
the
drug
itself
more
or
less.
and
you're
saying
the
blotter
paper
does
not
dilute
it
more
or
less.
there's
the
same
amount
on
a
given
piece
of
blotter
paper.
and
the
same
amount
on
a
given
piece
of
sugar.
is
that
the
argument?
justice
souter
but
your
argument
rests
then
i
think
on
the
assumption
that
there
cannot
be
a
mixture
within
congressional
purpose
unless
the
mixture
gives
a
means
of
varying
concentration,
whereas
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
deal
with
mixture
as
a
means
of
varying
the
ease
of
distribution.
and
if
the
latter
is
the
real
characteristic
of
mixture,
then
you've
got
a
mixture
when
you
combine
the
lsd
with
the
blotter
paper
in
the
same
way
that
you
have
a
mixture
when
you
combine
the
cocaine
with
its
cutting
agent.
justice
souter
when
he's
selling
it
on
blotter
paper
as
opposed
to
selling
in
it
a
jar
or
a
tube,
he
is
selling
it
in
a
way
which
makes
it
more
likely
to
reach
more
people.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
implicates
the
notion
of
mixture.
it's
an
entirely
different
argument
to
say...
and
i
realize
that
you...
that
you're
going
to
get
onto
this...
it's
a
very
different
argument
to
say
that
the
various
means
of
mixtures
of
lsd
raise
equal
protection
or
due
process
problems.
but
that's...
that's
not
it
seems
to
me
the
question
for
the
statutory
interpretation,
which
is
whether
there's
a
mixture
there
at
all.
justice
souter
because
you
could...
you
could
invite
ten
friends
to
drink
the
orange
juice,
couldn't
you?
justice
souter
you
couldn't
do
that
with
a
little
piece
of
blotter
paper?
justice
souter
yes,
but
the
blotter...
the
blotter
paper
isn't
going
through
the
mucus
membrane.
justice
souter
i
thought
you
were
defining
mixture
as
that
which
could
be
ingested
in
any
one
of
these
four
ways
in
combination
with
the
drug.
if
that's
going
to
be
the
definition,
then
it's
not
going
to
work
for
the
blotter
paper.
justice
souter
i
misunderstood.
