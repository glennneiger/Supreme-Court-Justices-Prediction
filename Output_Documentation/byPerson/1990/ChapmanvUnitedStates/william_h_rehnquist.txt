chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-5744,
richard
l.
chapman
and
others
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
kelly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
relation
of
a
gram
to
an
ounce
or
a
pound,
mr.
kelly?
chief
justice
rehnquist
28
grams
in
an
ounce.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
some
people
would
say
taking
the
first
dose
didn't
give
him
much
benefit.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you...
are
you
using
the
term
carrier
as
a
word
of
art?
chief
justice
rehnquist
some...
something
that...
a
suitcase
would
likewise
be
a
carrier?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
this
is
a
fairly
unique
carrier
then,
because
it's...
the
drug
is
actually
mixed
in
with
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
thought,
in
answering
one
of
the
previous
questions,
you
said
that
it
did
mix?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
would
distinguish
this
carrier
at
any
rate
from
carriers
which
are,
you
know,
like...
like
a
suitcase,
a
box,
a
bottle,
something
like
that,
where
there...
where
there
isn't
any
combination.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
what
line
of
cases
are
you
relying
on
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's...
what's
your...
what
do
you
think
is
the
best
case
you
have
going
for
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
those
are
really
quite
far
afield
from
this
subject.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--they
have
it
within
their
own
power
to
remedy
those
disparities,
don't
they?
i
mean,
they
can
adjust
their
means
of
distribution.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kelly.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
one-eighth
or
one-quarter.
you
mean
one-eighth
square?
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
one-eighth
inch
square...
a
square
with...
with
a
size
of
one-eighth
inch--
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
tablets
being
originally
some
other
drug
than
lsa...
lsd
i
take
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
sugar
or
sucrose
or--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
kelly,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kelly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
chapman
versus
the
united
states.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
convicted
of
selling
10
sheets
of
blotter
paper
impregnated
with
1,000
doses
of
lsd.
although
the
pure
lsd
contained
in
the
paper
weighed
only
about
50
milligrams
because
the
combined
weight
of
the
lsd
and
the
blotter
paper
was
5.7
grams,
the
district
court
sentenced
petitioners
to
the
five-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence
required
by
a
federal
law
for
distributing
more
than
one
gram
of
a
mixture
or
substance
containing
a
detectable
amount
of
lsd.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
upheld
this
and
we
granted
certiorari
because
there
was
a
split
between
the
courts
of
appeals.
in
a
decision
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
the
statute
requires
the
weight
of
the
carrier
medium
to
be
included
when
determining
the
appropriate
sentence
for
trafficking
in
lsd.
the
statute
refers
to
a
mixture
or
substance
containing
a
detectable
amount
and
therefore,
we
hold
the
entire
mixture
or
substance
is
to
be
weighed
when
calculating
the
sentence
rather
than
the
amount
of
the
pure
drug
contained
in
the
mixture.
and
we
hold
that
the
statute
is
so
construed
as
constitutional.
congress
intended
to
punish
large
volume
traffickers
at
any
level,
and
the
statute
increases
the
penalty
for
such
persons
by
measuring
the
street
weight
of
the
drugs
in
the
diluted
form
in
which
they
are
sold.
it
was
rational
for
congress
to
set
penalties
including
the
weight
of
the
blotter
paper
which
is
the
chosen
tool
of
the
trade
for
those
who
traffic
in
lsd.
congress
was
also
justified
in
seeking
to
avoid
arguments
about
the
accurate
weight
of
pure
drugs
that
might
have
been
extracted
from
the
paper.
since
blotter
paper
seems
to
be
the
carrier
of
choice
for
lsd
distributors,
the
sentencing
scheme
will
do
exactly
what
it
was
supposed
to
do
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases.
they
will
punish
more
heavily
those
who
deal
in
larger
amounts
of
drugs.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
has
joined.
