justice
scalia
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
it's
a
mixture.
i
mean,
when
it
penetrates
the
fiber,
the
statute
and
the
sentencing
guidelines
both
say
it
has
to
be
either
a
mixture
or
a
substance
containing
a
detectable
amount
of
heroin.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
blotter
is
either
a
mixture
or
a
substance.
you've
got
to
say
the
blotter
is
a
substance,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
the
case...
i
don't
see
why
that's
not
the
case
with
respect
to
the
blotter
as
well.
i
mean,
every
time
you
take
a
fixed
quantity
and
mix
it
with
a
larger...
with
a
larger
substance
you
dilute
it
more
and
more...
the
greater
the
substance
you
mix
it
with,
right?
and
it's
the
same
with
the
blotter.
the...
if
you
use
a
little
blotter
which
is
of
a
light
weight,
you're
not
able
to
distribute
it
to
as
many
people.
if
you
use
a
larger
blotter,
it
will
be
more
diluted
but
you
can
distribute
it
more
widely.
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
there
a
dose
of
lsd
and
there
is
not
a
dose
of
cocaine?
justice
scalia
i
mean
you
speak
as
though
it
doesn't
matter
how
strong
it
is.
is
that
so?
justice
scalia
it
is
or
it
must
be?
justice
scalia
well,
but
unless
it
must
be,
then
i
am
correct
that
the
more
blotter
paper
you
use,
the
more
distribution
you
can
make,
just
as
the
more...
whatever
you
mix
cocaine
with...
you
use
the
more
distribution
you
can
make.
justice
scalia
what
about
weems
and
solem?
we
have...
we
have
several
cases
that
are
thought
by...
one
that
clearly
requires
that
sentences
be
proportionate.
justice
scalia
isn't
it
a
disproportion...
disproportionateness
of
sentencing
that
you're
mainly
complaining
about?
justice
scalia
well,
i
thought
it...
i
thought
it's
your
only
criticism.
i
mean
i
assume
that--
justice
scalia
--and
you
think
that
that's
all
that's
needed
to
comply
with
it?
justice
scalia
so
suppose
i'm
a...
i'm
not
a
distributor
of
lsd
at
all.
i
buy
one
of
these
postage
stamp
size
squares
of
blotter
paper,
and
i
don't
like
sucking
on
blotter
paper
so
i
drop
it
in
a
glass
of
orange
juice
which
i...
must
weigh...
you
know,
must
be
more
than
10
grams.
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
get
a
10-year
minimum
sentence?
justice
scalia
oh,
okay,
it
does
not
apply
to
users?
justice
scalia
okay,
so
if
i
buy
two
squares,
however--
justice
scalia
--and
i
make
one
orange
juice
for
me
and
one
for
my
friend
and
hand
the
orange
juice
to...
for
my
friend,
i'm
a
big
time
distributor?
justice
scalia
mr.
larkin,
how
do
you
distinguish...
as
i
assume
you
do...
the
blotter
from
the
suitcase
or
the
glass
or
the
bottle?
do
you...
do
you
adopt
justice
souter's
line
whether
it
is
readily
extricable
from
whatever
it
is
mixed
or
mixed
with
or
contained
in?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
lsd
on...
on
a
what?
on
a?
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
--just
once
again,
mr.
larkin,
what
does
the
government
contend
is
the
test
for
whether
it's
a
substance
containing?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
confusion.
i
think
the
confusion
is
you
think
it's
enough
if
you...
if
the
blotter
paper
is
or
is
often,
if
not
ordinarily,
placed
within
the
body.
you
don't
insist
that
it
be
swallowed?
justice
scalia
what...
what
you
mean
by
ingested
is
place
it
within
the
body,
even
if
you
spit
it
out
later.
justice
scalia
--it
doesn't
have
to
be
necessarily.
i
think
it's...
it's
enough
to
define
what
is
a
"substance
containing"
if
it
is
something
that
is
commonly...
at
least
commonly
used
that
way.
that
will
distinguish
this
from
the
bottle
and
the
suitcase
i
assume.
justice
scalia
it's
convenient.
i
mean,
if
you
pass
a
prohibition
law,
do
you
have
to
provide
different
sentences
for...
for
bringing
in
a
gallon
of
wine
from
bringing
in
a
gallon
of...
of
whiskey
even
though
the
amount
of
alcohol
is
vastly
different?
