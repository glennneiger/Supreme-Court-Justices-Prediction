justice
white
well,
[inaudible]
dealt
particularly
with
lsd,
and
it
used
those
words,
lsd?
so--
justice
white
--what
do
you
think
it
meant?
justice
white
yes,
but
it
also
did
it
with
lsd.
justice
white
well,
what
did
it
mean...
what
did
it
mean
then?
justice
white
suppose...
suppose
the
lsd
was...
you
put
a
little
drop
of
lsd
in
a...
in
some
orange
juice,
would
that
be
a
mixture?
justice
white
well,
would
it...
would
it
be
a
mixture?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
what
did
it
mean
with
respect
to
lsd?
justice
white
they
apparently
believed
that
lsd
could
be
mixed
with
something.
justice
white
and
if
it...
if
it
was
mixed
with
something,
you
weighed
the
mixture.
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
i
take
it
then
you
suggest
that
we
should
just
forget
about
the
words
mixture
or
substance,
when
lsd
is
involved,
because
lsd
is
always...
when
it's
sold,
it's
always
being
carried
in
something
else.
justice
white
tell
me
again.
justice
white
so
at
least
you
say
that
you
ought
to
weigh
not
just
the
lsd
in
a
dose,
but
the
alcohol
it's
been
mixed
with?
justice
white
why
do
you
seize
on
the
due
process
clause?
didn't
judge
posner
say
equal
protection
was
involved?
justice
white
well,
where
are
you
getting
these
facts?
