justice
stevens
i
still
didn't
understand
that
one
half
of
your
answer...
one
that's...
when
is
a
dot
is
put
on
a
square,
does
the
dot
expand
to
the
full
area
of
the
square?
justice
stevens
but
it
doesn't
cover
the
entire
square,
so
the
square
would
be
partly
just
blotter
paper
and
then
it
would
get
increasingly
concentrated
as
it
gets
to
the
middle.
justice
stevens
before
you
do
that,
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
stevens
there
have
been
an
awful
lot
of
factual
discussion
in
the
opinion
below
and
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
argument.
nobody
seems
to
disagree
about
the
facts,
but
are
they
verifiable
for
us
if
we
didn't
understand
how
you...
you
know,
some
of
the
factual...
is
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
all
this
that
you've
told
us
about
drug
distribution?
justice
stevens
are
they
also
experts
on
the
methods
of
distribution
in
the
illegal
drug
trade
and
all?
i
mean
do
they
describe
how
it
is
in
fact
done
when
it's
done
illegally?
justice
stevens
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
controversy,
but
i'm
just
a
little
concerned
about
the...
okay.
justice
stevens
does
that
make
it
a...
which
does
it
make
it...
a
mixture
or
a
substance?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
he...
he
sprayed
furniture
polish
on
the
top
of
a
table.
do
you
have
a
mixture
or
substance
composed
of
the
table
and
the
furniture
polish?
justice
stevens
well,
they're
stuck
together...
aren't
they
stuck
together
in
precisely
the
same
way
the--
justice
stevens
--may
i
go
back
just
to
the
orange
juice
example
for
a
minute?
is
it
correct
that
if
one
of
these
doses...
whatever
the
normal
dose
is
dumped
in
an
8-ounce
glass
of
orange
juice
and
then
10
people
drink
it,
each
of
the
ten
would
get
the
same
effect
as
if
blotter
paper
had
been
swallowed?
justice
stevens
is...
can
this
stuff
be
diluted
so
much
that
it's
no
longer
effective?
justice
stevens
so
if
25
micrograms
were
dumped
in
an
8-ounce
glass
of
orange
juice,
it
would
not
have...
it
really
would
only
be
useful
to
sell
to
one
person?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
but
it
is
true...
it
is
true
if
whatever
that
normal
minimum
amount
is
is
consumed
on
a
blotter
paper
in
the
one
case,
sugar
cube
in
another,
and
a
glass
of
orange
juice
on
the
other,
there
will
be
dramatic
differences
in
the
sentence
to
which
the
distributor
would
be
exposed?
justice
stevens
and
even
though
it
doesn't
increase
the
number
of
likely
purchasers
of
the
substance?
justice
stevens
that's
right.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
would
that
definition
of...
would
that
definition
apply
if
they
put
the
blotter
paper
in
your
mouth,
say,
and
sucked
it
like
a
tablet,
and
then...
once
you
got
the
lsd
off
you
spit
out
the
blotter
paper?
justice
stevens
i
just...
maybe
this
is
another
absurd
hypothetical,
but
if
the
blotter
paper
were
dipped
in
the
glass
of
orange
juice
and
left
there
long
enough
for
the
stuff
to...
i
take
it
it
would
leave
the
blotter
paper
and
become
associated
with
the
orange
juice.
then...
i'm
just
suggesting
that
maybe
the
blotter
paper
is
not
necessarily
ingested
in
order
to
ingest
the
substance.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
no,
but
at
the
time
it's
sold,
it's
carried
by
the
blotter
paper.
at
the
time
it's
ingested,
it's
ingested
in
the
orange
juice
form.
and
i
take
it
then...
i'm
trying
to
get
an
example
where
the
blotter
paper
would
not
enter
the
human
body
the
way
you
say
it.
and
i'm
just
suggesting
it
may
not
necessarily
enter
the
blotter...
the
body
if
it's
merely
a
carrier
and
it's
used
in
that
rather
perhaps
unusual--
justice
stevens
let
me
give
you
another
absurd
hypothetical.
what
if
the
dealer
labelled
his
product
with
a
warning
label
that
said
that
blotter
paper
is
not
to
be
swallowed.
instructions
for
use
are
dip
it
in
a
glass
of
water
and
drink
the
water
after...
after
leaving
it
there
for
a
minute
or
whatever.
justice
stevens
well,
they
don't
sign
these.
they
just
instruct
the...
the
customer
to
do
it
that
way.
[laughter]
and
they'd
say...
they'd
say,
warning:
blotter
paper
is
merely
a
carrier.
ingest
in
the
following
way,
and
they
give
instructions
that
will
avoid
the
swallowing
of
the
blotter
paper.
i
take
it
you'd
still
say
it
was
a
mixture?
justice
stevens
okay.
even
if
they
say
regard
this
blotter
paper
like
a
suitcase.
[laughter]
