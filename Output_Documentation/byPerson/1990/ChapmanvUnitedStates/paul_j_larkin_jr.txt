mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
lsd
infused
blotter
paper
is
a
mixture
or
substance
containing
detectable
amount
of
lsd.
there
are
certain
matters
in
this
regard
that
unfortunately
were
not
in
the
record,
because
petitioners
did
not
make
this
an
evidentiary
matter
in
the
district
court.
but
the
court
has
shown
some
interest
in
the
technical
side
of
it,
and
so
let
me
explain
some
of
the
facts
behind
the
conclusion
i
just
stated.
as
petitioners--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
facts
that
are
not
in
the
record
i
will
clearly
identify
to
you
as
being
told
to
me
by
chemists
at
the
dea.
there
are
other
facts
that
are...
some
of
which
are
in
the
literature
that
has
been
cited
in
the
briefs.
and
a
goodly
number
of
it
is
in
the
opinions
of
the
sixth
circuit
courts
that
have
addressed
this
issue.
those
courts,
for
example,
have
looked
at
lsd
infused
blotter
paper
and
have
treated
them
as
a
mixture
or
a
substance.
for
example,
in
this
case
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
lsd
infused
blotter
paper
is
a
mixture
and
that
is
an
accurate
characterization,
because
what
happens
when
you
make
lsd
is
as
follows.
you
can
take
the
blotter
paper
and
use
an
atomizer
and
spray
the
lsd
on
it.
that,
for
example,
is
how
respondent
marshall
prepared
the
blotter
paper.
and
that
fact
is
at
paragraph
27
of
the
presentence
report
in
marshall's
case.
you
can
take
the
atomizer
and
spray
the
paper,
and
that
will
distribute
the
lsd
solution,
that
is,
lsd
in
alcohol
or
water
over
the
paper.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
you
can
i
think
accurately
describe
it
either
way.
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
used
the
term--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so.
the
furniture
polish
and
the
top
of
the
table
don't
mix
together
in
any
way.
it's--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
mean
if
you
polished
them
in
and...
so
that
the...
it
becomes
absorbed
into
the
wood,
then
what
you
have
is
a
mixture
of
the
wood
with
the
polish.
the
polish
is
now
part
of
the
wood.
and
something
similar
happens
in
this
case.
for
example,
you
can
take
tongs
and
take
blotter
paper
and
dip
the
blotter
paper
into
the
solution.
and
that
is
one
easy
way
of
making
sure
the
solution
spreads
out
entirely
over
the
entire
paper.
for
example,
the
tenth
circuit
in
one
of
the
cases
we
cited
used
the
word
"absorbs"
to
describe
the
inner
action
between
the
solution
and
the
paper.
the
paper
will
absorb
the
solution.
in
that
sense
you
can
have
a
mixture,
and
that
satisfied
both
the
dictionary
and
even
in
fact
the
scientific
definitions
given
to
that
term.
the
two
units
are...
the
two
items
are
mixed
together.
and
in
fact
in
the
scientific
definition,
they're
mixed
together
because
you
can
take
them
apart.
there
is
no
chemical
bond
between
the
lsd
solution
and
the
paper.
so
the
seventh
circuit
was
correct
in
describing
it
as
a
mixture.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct,
if
you
distribute
it.
if
you
only
have
it
for
personal
use,
the
mandatory
minimums
in
841
do
not
apply,
because
that
is
for
the
manufacture
or
distribution.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
users
are
punished
under
a
different
statute
if
you
only
have
it
for
personal
use.
so--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--and
you
distribute
it,
then
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
you
are,
under
the
statute
in
that
case,
eligible
for
a
10-year
sentence
and
i
might--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--you
could
or
as
many
as--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
and
it's
not
always
a
postage
stamp
size.
just
another
little
fact
to
clarify.
in
the
case
of...
of
petitioner
chapman,
they
were
1-inch
square,
but
they
can
vary
anywhere
from
one-eighth
of
an
inch
to
a
quarter
of
an
inch
on
a
sheet
of
paper,
which
can
be
cut
up
into
normally
between
100
and...
or
a
thousand
squares.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
that
small...
i
think...
as
i've
been
told
by
the
dea
the
industry
standard
so
to
speak
is
probably
a
quarter
of
an
inch,
the
reason
being
one-eighth
of
an
inch
is
more
difficult
to
break
off
if
you're
trying
to
distribute
it
to
someone
in
a
small
quantity.
so
you
can
have
it
broken
down
into
a
sheet
that
contains
anywhere
from
a
hundred
to
a
thousand
different
doses.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
not,
because
what
you
would
have
probably
is
a
dilution
factor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
it
can.
the
minimum
dosage
that
is
likely
to
lead
to
hallucinogenic
effect
is
25
micrograms.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
effectively.
if
you
had
the
minimum
amount
i
believe
the
rest
would
probably
be
diluted.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
i
think
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
there
is
some
sort
of
uniform
amount
that
is
distributed
in
this
regard,
and
according
to
the
dea
they've
told
me
that
that's
not
necessarily
the
case.
for
example,
the
sentence--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
if
you
increase
the
total
quantity
in
that
respect,
you
will
increase
the
weight
and
it
can
potentially
affect
the
mandatory
minimum
[inaudible]--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
if
you
were
only
taking
one
at
a
time--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--then
that
might
be
true.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
respondent...
but
petitioners
for
example
are
accused
also
of
being
irrational,
but
they
themselves
subject...
are
subject
to
some
of
the
same
irrationalities.
for
example,
petitioner
said
he
would
count
ls...
he
would
count
the
10
ounces
of
alcohol
if
lsd
was
an
alcohol,
but
he
wouldn't
count
ounces
of
the
orange
juice.
in
our
view,
what
congress
did
in
1986
was
pass
a
statute
that
was
designed
to
strike
at
drug
trafficking
in
whatever
form
it
was
found,
whether
a
drug
was
found
pure
or
impure,
cut
or
uncut,
ready
for
distribution
at
the
wholesale
level
or
the
retail
level,
or
ready
for
consumption
by
the
consumer.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
that
adding
different
cutting
agents...
carrier
mediums,
if
you
will...
will
increase
the
exposure
a
person
has
under
the
statute,
and
that's
because
congress
clearly
picked
a
weight-based
approach.
but
the
percentage--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--precisely.
and
the
figures
in
the
case
of
lsd
don't
differ
by
several
orders
of
magnitude
from
the
figures
that
you
can
see
in
the
case
of
heroin.
for
example,
in
this
case
the
lsd
that
was
distributed
by
chapman
had
a
percentage
value
of.877.
that
distributed
by
marshall
was.59.
that's
less
than
1
percent.
but
that's
not
off
by
degrees
of
magnitude
from
the
type
of
heroin
you
can
see
on
the
street.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
different
cases
and
in
those
cases
they
have
identified
the
percentage
amount
of
heroin
in
some
of
the
drugs
that
were
seized.
and
that
some
of
that
percentage
amount
of
heroin
was
as
small
as
1.2
percent.
the
dea
also
engaged
in
what
is
called
their
domestic
monitor
program
to
see
what
the
purity
of
different
drugs
is,
and
they
purchase
them
on
the
street
as
a
result.
and
in
the
domestic
monitor
program
that
we
pointed...
cited
to...
the
study
we
cited
to
in
our
brief,
the
purity
in
some
cases
was
as
low
as.6
percent.
and
then
it
varied
dramatically,
sometimes
from
city
to
city.
in
baltimore,
for
example,
3.1
percent
was
the
average
amount
of
heroin
found
in
some
samples,
whereas
in
new
york
it
can
vary
up
to
perhaps
as
much
as
40
percent.
plus
some
of
the
studies
that
were
cited
in
the...
in
the
books,
in
the
amicus
brief
for
example,
said
that
the
average
amount
of
thc
which
is
the
active
ingredient
in
marijuana
in
an
average
marijuana
cigarette
can
be
1
to
5
percent.
the
average
amount
of
thc
which
is
the
active
ingredient
in
hashish,
found
in
street-level
hashish,
can
be
4
to
10
percent.
so
the
dilution
factor
that
you
see
in
the
case
of
lsd
is
not
markedly
different
from
the
dilution
factor
you
see
in
the
case
of
other
drugs.
now,
it's
also
doubtless
the
case
that
there
will
be
people
who
deal
in
quantities
of
cocaine
that
are
much
purer...
people
who
are
further
up
the
chain.
and
the
statute
allows
a
court
to
take
that
into
account.
after
all,
the
phrase
mixture
or
substance
is
responsible
for
two
things
under
841(b).
it
can
trigger
a
mandatory
minimum,
and
it
can
set
a
range.
but
it's
within
that
range
that
a
district
court
can
sentence.
it's
not
irrational,
therefore,
for
congress
to
legislate
in
this
manner,
because
what
congress
decided
to
do
was
change
the
drug
sentencing
system
around.
in
1970,
congress
took
its
first
step
at
this
problem.
it
passed
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
and
prevention
and
control
act.
that
act
classified
controlled
substances
according
to
schedules
and
set
penalties
based
on
the
type
of
schedule
involved.
congress
changed
the
system
in
1984.
as
part
of
the
comprehensive
crime
control
act,
congress
introduced
the
principle
that
the
sentence
should
vary
according
to
the
purity
of
the
drug
involved.
and
then
in
1986,
congress
once
again
revised
the
system
and
adopted
the
one
we
now
have
today.
in
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1986,
congress
introduced
the
principle
that
the
mixture
or
substance
containing
a
detectable
amount
of
a
drug
should
be
used
as
the
basis
for
calculating
the
sentence.
the
statute
is
quite
clear
in
that
regard.
this
was
not
a
careless
way
of
drafting.
what's
clear
is
that
you
cannot
simply
look
to
the
amount
of
pure
drug.
certainly
when
you're
dealing
with
drugs
like
cocaine
or
heroin,
and
also
when
you're
dealing
with
the...
drugs
like
lsd.
and
the
reason...
one
of
the
reasons
you
know
that
from
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
is
that
the
pure
quantity
of
methamphetamine
or
pcp
can
sometimes
serve
as
the
basis
for
sentencing.
congress,
therefore,
clearly
knew
how
to
distinguish
between
the
quantity
of
pure
drug
involved
and
the
quantity
of
the
mixture
or
substance
containing
detectable
amount
of
the
pure
drug
involved,
and
it
is
the
latter
that
we
have
here.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
that
is
a
reasonable
way
of
looking
at
it.
keep
in
mind
that
this
problem
of
unusual
hypotheticals
only
arises
when
you're
looking
to
the
word
"substance".
no
one
would
say
that
a
buick
containing
a
certain
quantity
of
cocaine
is
mixed
with
the
cocaine.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
only
when
you're
using
the
word
"substance".
now,
congress
in
the
word
"substance"
didn't
use,
we
think,
a
technical
term.
a
chemist
would
probably
have
used
the
term
"compound"
to
describe
the
fact
that
there
was
some
chemical
bonding
going
on.
but
congress
used
a
different
term,
"substance".
and
it
may
be
because
what
they
had
in
mind
was
something
like
a
tablet,
something
that
petitioners
generally
tend
to
overlook.
lsd
on
blotter
paper
is
not
materially
different
from
lsd
on
a
tablet.
in
each
case,
you
have
an
active
ingredient
and
an
inactive
ingredient.
and
you
have
more
of
the--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--tablet.
a
pill.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
lsd
can
be
distribute
in
pill
form.
and
according
to
the
dea,
it
is
distributed
in
pill
form
in
roughly
9
percent
of
the
cases.
90
percent
of
the
cases
involved
blotter
paper,
9
percent
with
tablets,
and
1
percent
generally
everything
else.
but
you
can
distribute
lsd
in
a
pill--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
wouldn't
necessarily
call
them
a
drug,
your
honor.
what
i've
been
told...
you
can
make
a
tablet
of--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--matters
like
that.
you
can
actually
make
it
from
rather
simple
ingredients
that
don't
have
a
very
complex
composition.
and
that
it
can
be
done
with
basically
a
pill
press
so
that
you
can
manufacture
lsd
for
distribution
in
tablet
form
as
well
as
in
blotter
paper
form.
and
if
it's
in
a
tablet
form,
we
think
that
is
a
mixture
or
a
substance.
you
count
the
weight
of
the
entire
tablet.
in
this
respect
we
disagree
with
judge
cummings
who
wrote
in
the
dissent.
what
judge
cummings
cited
for
his
contrary
review...
view...
were
two
cases
that
were
decided
under
the
harrison
narcotics
act,
was
the
predecessor
to
the
1970
drug
act,
and
which
did
not
take
into
account
the
weight
of
the
mix...
of
the
entire
unit,
because
it
didn't
matter.
in
fact,
if
you
looked
at
a
particular
page
reference
in
the
cases
he
cites,
all
that
was
cited
and
mentioned
at
those
pages
was
the
fact
that
a
capsule
had
a
certain
weight
with
and
without
the
heroin
that
was
inside.
the
courts
in
those
cases
didn't
draw
any
legal
significance
from
that.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
the
way
justice
souter
put
it,
and
the
way
you
tried
to
summarize
it,
is
a...
is
a
reasonable
way
of
looking
at
it.
can
you
easily
distinguish
between
the
two?
but
there's
also
i
think
perhaps
another
way
of
looking
at
it
that
i
could
offer
to
you
at...
as
another
way
of
distinguishing
among
them.
there
are
four
ways
drugs
can
be
taken
into
the
human
body.
and
after
all,
unless
these
types
of
drugs
are
taken
into
the
human
body,
they
are
not
going
to
have
the
desired
effect.
you
can
take
it
orally.
you
can
inhale
it,
in
which
case
it
goes
into
the
lungs.
it
can
pass
through
a
mucus
membrane
in
the
nose
or
under
the
tongue.
or
it
can
be
injected.
so,
if
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
something
that
is
going
to
be
actually
consumed,
taken
into
the
body,
it
is
a
reasonable
way
of
looking
at
that
as
being
a
substance.
nobody
therefore
is
going
to
have
any
difficulty
i
think
distinguishing
an
automobile
and
a
suitcase
from
a
tablet
or
blotter
paper.
like
i
say,
a
tablet
that
you
take
that
has
lsd
enters
the
body
and
the
body
breaks
it
down,
and
the
drug
is
then
dispersed
throughout.
that's
a
relatively
easy
way
i
think
of
looking
at
it.
and
that's
the
way
in
fact
some...
several
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
looked
at
it.
the
sixth...
excuse
me...
the
fourth,
sixth,
and
eighth
circuits
have
all
said
that
the
blotter
paper
becomes
impregnated
with
the
lsd
and
is
then
ingested.
and
they
have
all
said,
therefore,
the
question
is
whether
this
is
a--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
would,
because
that's
taking
a
substance
in
through
a
mucus
membrane
in
the
mouth.
for
example,
if
you
put
it
on
gum,
you
would
count
the
weight
of
the
gum.
if--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--if...
the
blotter--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
was...
i
was
focusing
not
on
mixture,
your
honor,
but
more
on
substance.
the
blotter
paper--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--can
readily
be
said
to
be
the
mixture.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
i
think
if--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
in
a...
in
a
broad
sense
right.
like
that.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
so
that...
and
that
i
think
is
a
way
of
eliminating
most
of
the
absurd
hypotheticals
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--oh,
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
you
put
the
blotter
paper
in
the
glass
of
orange
that
justice
white
hypothesized,
you
would
count
we
think
the
weight
of
the
orange
juice.
and
in
that
circumstance
you
would
be
exposed
to
a
very
stiff
penalty.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
if
you
went
about
it
that
way,
it
would
not
necessarily
enter
the
body.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
so,
and
i
think...
i
think
that
was
the
way
you
originally
put
it,
which
is
why
i
tried
to
answer
it
that
way.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
briefs
do
not,
your
honor.
and
the
record
in
the
chapman
case
does
not.
and
unfortunately,
nor
does
the
record
in
the
marshall
case.
in
the
chapman
case
what
happened...
the
one
that
the
court
has
now
granted
review...
is
that
chapman
and
his
confederates
filed
a
motion
to
have
841(b)
declared
unconstitutional
but
did
not
attach
any
type
of
factual
material
in
support
of
it
and
didn't
seek
to
my
knowledge
an
evidentiary
hearing.
so
it
wasn't
presented
as
an
evidentiary
hearing.
they
were
essentially
taking
the
position
that
the
statute
was
irrational,
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
can't...
i
do
not
know
a
particular
source,
but
what
i
can
point
to
you
is
this.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
recent
circuit
court
decisions,
and
there
are
six
of
them
including...
actually
more
than
six
of
them.
there
are
several
of
them
that
are
being
held
pending
this
case.
those
cases
tend
to
involve
blotter
paper.
and
i've
been
told
by
the
dea
why
that
is
so,
and
can
explain
it
to
you
if
you'd
like.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
reason
i
used...
i
used
tend
is...
i
made
a
mistake.
they
do...
these
cases
do
involve
blotter
paper.
what
i
was
trying
to
say
basically
was
an
answer
that
gave
me
some
information
that
justice
kennedy
didn't
want
me
to
give.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i'm
sure
it
would
make
it
easier
to
apprehend
them.
i
hope
they
would
do
more
of
that.
but
they
don't
see
it
that
often.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
we'd
say
it's
a
nice
try
but
didn't
work.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
petitioners
have
also
leveled
the
constitutional
challenges
to
the
statute,
and
we
think
the
challenges
have
to
fail.
what
congress
did
was
try
to
strike
a
drug
trafficking,
as
i
said,
in
whatever
form
it
was
found.
it
used
weight
as
the
medium
for
trying
to
do
that.
it
could
have
used
just
the
type
of
drug
that
was
involved,
as
it
did
in
1970.
it
could
have
used
the
purity
of
the
drug
involved.
and
it
could
even
have
used
the
dosage
numbers,
which
is
what
petitioners
say
congress
should
have
done
in
the
case
of
lsd.
but
we
don't
think
congress
had
to.
the
dilution
rate
that
shows
up
in
these
sorts
of
cases
is
similar
to
the
dilution
rate
that
shows
up
in
the
case
of
heroin.
therefore,
it's
not
bizarre
to
see
these
types
of
results.
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
also
in
which
there's
no
first
amendment,
no
conceivable
first
amendment
claim,
that
can
be
made.
the
result
is
congress
is
entitled
to
require
people
to
stay
a
long
way
from
the
line.
and
congress
is
entitled
to
regulate
with,
generally
speaking,
a
very
blunt
instrument.
congress
doesn't
have
to
make
the
types
of
refinements
that
the
petitioners
would
like.
and
the
best
proof
of
that
i
guess
is
that
this
court's
decisions
would
allow
congress
to
pass
a
flat
determinant
sentencing
law.
whether
you
distribute
one
dose
of
lsd
or
a
thousand
doses
of
lsd,
you
get
20
years
in
prison.
that,
too,
is
a
rather
blunt
instrument
for
regulating
the
narcotics
traffick,
but
it
is
one
that
congress
has
the
power
to
adopt.
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
lsd
infused...
infused
blotter
paper
is
a
mixture
or
substance
containing
a
detectable
amount
of
lsd.
that
is
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute
in
light
of
the
market-oriented
approach
that
congress
adopted,
and
the
market-oriented
approach
is
a
reasonable
way
of
striking
at
the
drug
trade.
thank
you
very
much.
