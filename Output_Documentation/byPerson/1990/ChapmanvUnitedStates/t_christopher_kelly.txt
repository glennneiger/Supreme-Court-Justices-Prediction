mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
asked
this
court
to
restore
rationality
to
what
judge
posner
termed
the
bizarre
the
schedule
of
punishments
in
lsd
cases
that
no
one
is
able
to
justify.
the
issues
before
this
court
are
whether
an
lsd
carrier,
in
this
case
blotter
paper,
is
a
mixture
or
substance
containing
lsd
within
the
meaning
of
21
u.s.c.,
section
841.
and
if
so,
whether
the
sentencing
scheme
at
issue
here
violates
a
defendant's
due
process
right
to
be
free
from
arbitrarily
determined
sentences.
the
government
stipulated
that
lsd
is
sold
by
the
dose,
not
by
weight.
a
dose
of
lsd
is
very
small.
in
fact,
it's
infinitesimal
in
size.
it
weighs
about
50
millionths
of
a
gram.
because
it
is
so
small,
individual
dosages
are
generally
distributed
on
a
carrier.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
distributed
1,000
dosages
of
lsd
on
blotter
paper.
the
combined
weight
of
the
blotter
paper
and
the
lsd
was
about
5.7
grams.
the
government
stipulated
that
the
actual
weight
of
the
lsd
apart
from
the
blotter
paper
was
less
than
1
gram.
in
fact,
it
was
about
50
milligrams
or
less
than
1
percent
of
the
combined
weight
of
the
lsd
and
the
blotter
paper.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
there
are
28
or
about
28
grams
in
an
ounce.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
uh-huh.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
there
are
actually
two
different
ways
of
placing
lsd
on
blotter
paper.
one
is
to
mix
the
lsd
with
a
solution
of
alcohol
and
spray
it
across
the
paper.
the
other
way
is
to
place
a
dot
of
lsd
onto
the
center
of
a
square
of
blotter
paper
with
a
pipette.
blotter
paper
generally
comes
in
sheets
that
are
about
10
inches
square
and
they're
perforated
into
100
squares.
each
square
would
represent
one
dose
of
lsd.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
a
square
is
about
1-inch
square.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
sure.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it's
not
cut
in
the
sense
that
cocaine,
for
instance,
is
cut
by
mixing
it
with
mannitol.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
generally
if
lsd
is
being
distributed
in
liquid
form
in
a
vial,
justice
kennedy,
it
would
be
done
in
a
fairly
high
point
in
the
distribution
chain.
if
it's
being
distributed
to
the
average
consumer,
it
will
be
distributed
on
blotter
paper
or
on
another
carrier
such
as
a
sugar
cube
or
gelatin
capsules.
those
are
the
carriers
most
commonly
used.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it's
probably
going
to
be
in
something
like
a
vial.
and
if
it's
mixed
with
anything
else,
it
would
only
be,
again,
if
it
had
been
in
a
solution
of
alcohol
to
facilitate
spraying
it.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it
does
penetrate
into
the
fibers.
it,
in
essence,
soaks
through.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it
depends,
justice
o'connor,
in
what
sense
one
is
using
the
term
mixture
as
to
whether
that
would
constitute
a
mixture.
if
one--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--in
some
sense
one
could
say
that.
it
fair
to
say
that
the
word
can
be
interpreted
broadly
enough
to
include
that.
i
should
also...
to
clarify
my
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question...
indicate
that
when
we're
talking
about
the
1-inch
square
blotter
paper,
i'm
talking
about
what's
probably
an
average
size
and
that
in
fact
the
size
and
thickness
of
blotter
paper
does
vary
from
case
to
case.
in
the
cases
that
were
cited
in
our
brief,
individual
squares
of
blotter
paper,
for
instance,
ranged
in
weight
from
5.5
micro...
or
milligrams
to
15.4
milligrams.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
no,
it
will
probably
expand
somewhat,
but
it
won't
cover
the
entire
square.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
that's
correct,
because
generally
it's
going
to
sprayed
across
the
entire
sheet.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
certainly
there
is
a
sense
in
which
blotter
paper
is
a
substance,
as
is
any
material
thing.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
interestingly
the
majority
in
the
case
below
suggested
that
blotter
paper
is
probably
not
a
substance
in
that
sense
and
found
that
it
was
a
mixture.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
been
divided
as
to
whether
it's
a
mixture
or
whether
it's
a
substance.
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
substance
in
the
sense
that
congress
intended
that
term.
because
if
the
term
if
read
that
broadly,
then
anything
that
carries
the
lsd
could
viewed
as
a
substance.
and
whether
that's
a
vial
or
whether
that's
blotter
paper
or
a
syringe
or
a
boeing
747,
a
suitcase...
sure,
one
can
think
of
all
kinds
of
example.
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
sense
of
substance
in
which
congress
intended
the
word
to
be
used.
i
think
what
congress
was
getting
at
when
it
used
the
phrase,
mixture
or
substance,
are
those
things
which
multiply
the
value
of
the
drug
by
weight
which
multiply
the
amount
of
the
product
which
can
ultimately
distribute...
be
distributed
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
and
that's
the
sense
in
which
it's
used
when
we're
talking
about
a
cutting
agent.
if
one
mixes
cocaine
with
mannitol
for
instance,
one
creates
a
larger
amount
of
product
which
can
be
distributed
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
and
that's
what
congress
was
getting
at,
because
congress
wanted
to
impose
more
severe
punishments
upon
distributors
who
are
causing
greater
social
harm
by
multiplying
the
amount
of
the
product
that's
available
for
sale.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
that's
really
not
the
case
with
lsd,
justice
scalia.
one
dose
of
lsd
is
one
dose
of
lsd.
if
it's...
if
one
dose
is
placed
on
one
square
of
blotter
paper,
that
can
be
distributed
for
the
use
of
one
consumer.
if
it's...
if
100
doses
are
placed
on
100
doses
of
blotter
paper,
those
can
be
distributed
to
100
consumers.
it's
not
diluting
the
lsd
to
place
it
on
the
blotter
paper.
essentially
what
a...
what
a
consumer
can
do
after
receiving
a
square
of
blotter
paper
with
lsd
on
it
is
either
swallow
the
blotter
paper
whole
or
place
the
blotter
paper
in
his
mouth.
the
saliva
in
his
mouth
will
create
a
wash
which
will
separate
out
the
lsd
from
the
blotter
paper.
after
that's
done,
he
can
take
the
blotter
paper
out
and
throw
it
away.
the
lsd
is
just
as
pure
as
it
was
before
it
was
placed
on
the
blotter
paper.
it
hasn't
been
diluted
at
all.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
ls--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--lsd
is
distributed
in
relatively
standardized
doses
that
tend
to
be,
as
i
indicated,
about
50
millionths
of
a
gram.
a--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--it
is.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
reason
other
than
practical
reasons
that
it
must
be.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
well,
the...
it's
correct,
justice
scalia,
that
if
you
have
more
lsd,
you
need
more
blotter
paper
in
order
to
distribute
it
to
the
market.
but
it's
also
true
that
if
you
have
more
cocaine,
you
need
more
bottles
to
put
the
cocaine
in
to
distribute
it
in
the
market...
to
the
marketplace.
but
nobody's
weighing
the
bottle.
the
bottle
is
just
a
carrier
for
the
cocaine
or
the
envelope
or
paper
bindles
or
whatever
is
being
used
to
carry
cocaine.
but
nobody
weighs
those
bindles
or
those
envelopes.
it's
no
more
logical
to
weigh
the
blotter
paper
which
is
just
being
used
as
a
carrier
or
a
delivery
vehicle
for
the
lsd.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
cocaine
is
sold
in--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--justice
kennedy,
cocaine
is
sold
by
weight.
so
the
only
standard
dose
is
in
terms
of
a
user
going
out
and
deciding
for
himself
how
much
cocaine
he's
going
to
buy.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
guess
the
difference
is
that
if
a
user
goes
out
and
buys
a
quarter
gram
of
cocaine,
the
user
has
a
choice
of
how
much
cocaine
he's
going
to
consume
at
one
time.
a
user
of
lsd
generally
is
not
going
to
take
more
than
one
dose
of
lsd,
because
taking
additional
doses
isn't
going
to
give
any
particular
additional
benefit
to
that
user.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that,
chief...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it's
not
in
the
sense
that
the
purpose
of
the
cutting
agent
or
the
diluent
is
to
multiply
the
amount
of
the
drug
that's
available
for
sale.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it's
true
that
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
generally
necessary
to
have
some
sort
of
a
carrier
in
order
to
deliver
the
lsd
conveniently
to
a
consumer.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
well,
there
have
been
cases
and
there's
one
cited
in
my
reply
brief
in
which
an
individual
ingested
liquid
lsd
directly
into
his
eyeball,
apparently
from
a
pipette
or
a...
something
akin
to
an
eye
dropper,
but
that's
not--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--it
would
probably
diminish
greatly,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
think
my
point
is
that
it's
certainly
a...
probably
a
unique
property
of
lsd
that
it
is
so
infinitesimal
in
size
that
it
requires
a
carrier.
but
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
weigh
the
carrier
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
a
carrier
is
needed
to
carry
this
drug.
it's...
nobody
carries
cocaine
in
their
pocket.
you
have
to
have
a
carrier
to
transport
cocaine
to
the
user
as
well,
and
that's
generally
a
paper
bindle,
an
envelop.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
think
the
more
apt
analogy,
justice
souter,
is
that
if
you
took
a
piece
of
blotter
paper
and
folded
it
into
a
bindle
and
used
it
to
carry
cocaine,
nobody
would
weigh
the
blotter
paper.
but
if
you
used
the
same
piece
of
blotter
paper
to
carry
lsd,
courts
are
weighing
it.
it's
no
less--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--i
don't
think
that
congress
had
in
mind,
justice
souter,
that
the
ingestability
was
the
factor
that
would
count
something
as
a
mixture
or
substance.
again,
it
appears
from
the
legislative
history
of
section
841
that
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
visit
more
severe
sentences
upon
high-volume
dealers.
the
ingestability
of
the
carrier
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
volume
of
the
lsd
that
can
be
distributed.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
again,
the
fact
that
lsd
requires
a
carrier,
justice
souter,
does
not
to
me
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
weigh
that
carrier
when
congress
isn't
weighing
any
other
kinds
of
drug
carriers.
once
we
start
weighing
the
carriers,
we
see
the
absurd
results
that
i've
discussed
in
our
briefs.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i'm
using
carrier
as
a
generic
term
for
something
that
transports
a
drug.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
would
say
a
suitcase
would
be
a
carrier,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
yes,
the
drug
is...
the...
i
don't
know
if
mixed
in
with
it
is
a
correct
term
in
practice.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
think
that
the
term
can
be
read
that
broadly,
sure.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
think
that's
a
distinguishing
feature,
but
again
i
don't
see
that
as
a
feature
that
would
motivate
congress
to
want
to
weigh
that
carrier.
i
don't
know
why
congress
would
want
somebody
to
receive
a
sentence
that's
almost
20
times
longer
if
he
uses
a
sugar
cube
as
a
carrier
than
if
he
uses
blotter
paper
as
a
carrier.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
congress
used--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--congress
used
those
words
with
regard
to
every
drug
in
section
841.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
correct.
what
i--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--i
think
what
congress--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--ls...
if...
a
single--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--again,
i
think
that
the
word
can
be
certainly
be
read
broadly
enough
that
it
could
be.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
but
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
it
to
be
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
believe
that--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--sure,
it
could
be
mixed
for
instance--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--i
think
when
it's
mixed--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--when
it's
mixed
with
alcohol
in
order
to...
which
does
to
some
degree
increase
the
volume
when
it's
being
sprayed...
i
think
it's
very
appropriate
to
weigh
that.
i
think
when
it's
placed
on
another
controlled
substance
or
mixed
with
another
controlled
substance,
it's
very
appropriate
to
weigh
the
entire
mixture.
for
instance
when
it's
mixed
with
methamphetamines.
those
are
cases
that
are
clearly
covered
by
the
statute.
but
something
that's
simply
being
used
to
facilitate
transportation
of
the
drug
isn't
what
congress
was
getting
at,
because
that's
not
something
that
adds
to
the
value
of
the
drug
by
weight.
there's
no
rational
relationship
between--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--no,
as...
as
i
indicated
i
think
there
are
situations
when
these
words
are
very
meaningful
in
the
context
of
lsd.
when--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--when
it's
being
mixed
with
alcohol
in
order
to
spray
it.
i
think
that's
a
mixture
or
substance.
when
it's
being
mixed
with
another
controlled
substance
which
is
methamphetamines.
that's
certainly
a
mixture
or
substance.
possibly
congress
was
also
attempting
to
get
at
things
like
lsd
tartrate
or
isomers
or
salts...
things
like
that.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
correct.
that's--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--that's
essentially
true,
justice
souter.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
think
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
section
841(b)
is
not
a
statute
that
prohibits
the
use
of
blotter
paper.
there
is
a
separate
statute
in
the
federal
code
that
prohibits
the
use
of
any
drug
paraphernalia
that
certainly
encompasses
blotter
paper.
841(b)
is
a
punishment
statute.
841(a)
prohibits
the
distribution
of
lsd
in
any
form.
so
in
construing
a
punishment
statute
and
a
punishment
statute
that's
based
on
weight,
i
think
we
have
to
wonder
whether
congress
thought
that
there
was
some
relationship
between
the
weight
of
blotter
paper
and
the
sentence
that
should
be
imposed.
and
i
can't
imagine
that
congress
could
have
contemplated
such
a
relationship,
because
there
isn't
one.
the
dealer
who
is
selling
lsd
on
a
heavy
blotter
paper
is
certainly
no
more
culpable
than
the
dealer
who
is
selling
lsd
on
a
lighter
blotter
paper.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
think,
justice
souter,
that
in
order
to
interpret
the
statute,
one
has
to
divine
what
congress
meant
by
the
term
mixture
or
substance.
and
one
has
to
ask
whether
congress
would
have
intended
these
dramatically
varying
results
based
on
something
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
culpability.
certainly
that
has
implications
for
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
argument
as
well.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
would
be
happy
to
do
that,
justice
o'connor.
it's
a--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--sure.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
in
the
record
in
the
chapman
case,
there
is
very
little.
in
the
record
in
the
marshall
case,
which
was
joined
with
chapman
case
at
the
seventh
circuit,
there's
a
transcript
that
has
testimony
of
a
couple
of
chemists.
there
are
also
a
number
of
pharmacological
texts
and--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--there
are
a
number
cited
in
the
briefs.
licit
and
illicit
drugs
is
one
of
the
texts
that's
available
that
does
discuss
lsd.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
with
regard
to
the
constitutional
question,
if
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
law
is
correct,
the
question
becomes
whether
basing
sentences
on
what
amounts
to
a
completely
arbitrary
factor
violates
the
right
to
due
process
of
law.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
essentially
we're
relying
on
a
number
of
cases
that,
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
have
held
that
due
process
prohibits
the
government
from
being
arbitrary.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
guess
it's
hard
to
pick
out
which
one
is
the
best.
the
evidentiary
presumption
cases
such
as
tot,
the
eastlake
case
that
deals
with
zoning.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--they're
far
afield,
but
the
principle,
the
underlying
principle,
is
the
same.
and
that
is
that
government
cannot
be
arbitrary.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i'm
not
aware
of
one
in
which
sentencing
scheme
has
been
thrown
out,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
sentencing
scheme
that
has
based
sentences
on
a
factor
that
is
completely...
as
completely
arbitrary
as
the
one
that
exists
in
this
case.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--disproportionateness
of
sentences
is
one
aspect
of
it,
and
that's
an
aspect
that
respondent
marshall
raised
in
his
brief
and
that
was
the
focus
of
his
argument.
i
certainly
think
that
that's
a
valid
criticism
of
this
sentencing
law,
yes.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it's...
disproportionality
is
certainly
part
and
parcel
of
our
argument.
it's
actually
the
arbitrariness
of
the
factor
that
drives
the
sentence
that
is
what
we've
been
focusing
on.
the
fact
that
two
equally
situated
offenders
who
commit
exactly
the
same
crime
get
radically
different
sentences
based
on
whether
they
use
their
sugar
cube
or
whether
they
use
their
piece
of
blotter
paper...
piece
of
heavy
blotter
paper
or
piece
of
light
blotter
paper...
or
gelatin
capsule
or
didn't
use
anything
at
all
to
distribute
the
same
amount
of
lsd.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
they
could,
although
i
think
it's
doubtful
that
any
lsd
dealer
who
was
ever
aware
that
something
like
this
could
happen,
and
in
any
event
whether
they
can
choose
their
own
poison
or
not,
i
think
the
constitution
still
requires
that
sentences
not
be
meted
out
in
an
entirely
arbitrary
way.
and
that's
what's
happening
here.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i...
that's
correct.
and
because
we're
dealing
with
a
fifth
amendment
phrase,
i
guess
i'm
talking
about
due
process
because
we
have
to
talk
about
equal
protection
as
being
incorporated
into
due
process.
they're
again
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
argument.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
thank
you,
your
honor.
it's
our
position
that
basing
sentences
in
lsd
cases
in
the
weight
of
the
carrier
would
be
about
as
sensible
as
deciding
this
case
on
the
weight
of
the
briefs.
there's
simply
no
rational
relationship
between
that
weight
and
the
culpability
of
the
offender.
the
government
still
has
not
explained
why
congress
would
want
to
impose
longer
sentences
upon
a
distributor
who
sells
lsd
on
a
heavier
carrier
than
the
same
offender
who
sells
the
same
amount
of
lsd
on
a
lighter
carrier.
there's
no
reason
congress
would
want
to
do
that.
and
that
can't
be
what
congress
meant.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
no,
in
those
cases,
you
certainly
don't.
and
judge
posner
pointed
that
out
in
his
dissent.
but
the
difference
between
that
situation
and
this
situation
is
that
it's
not
just
a
question
of
convenience.
it's
a
question
of
rationality.
and
there's
no
rational
relationship
here
between
what
the
offender
is
doing
when
he's
selling
it
on
a...
on
a
heavier
paper
and
getting
a
longer
sentence
for
doing
that,
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
culpability.
i've
been
waiting
throughout
two
arguments
in
the...
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
this
argument
for
the
government
to
suggest
some
rational
reason
for
sentencing
two
identically
situated
offenders
differently
when
they've
committed
exactly
the
same
conduct.
and
the
government
has
yet
to
do
that.
i
think
that's
why
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
find,
first,
that
that
can't
be
what
congress
intended
by
the
phrase
"mixture
or
substance".
and
secondly,
that
if
that's
what
congress
intended,
the
law
has
to
be
struck
down,
because
it
violates
the
right
to
equal
protection
of
the
law.
it's
drawing
distinctions
between
identically
situated
offenders.
and
that
distinction
that
it's
drawing
isn't
based
on
a
rational
reason.
the
government's
theory
in
this
case
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
the
law
as
interpreted
by
the
government
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
for
that
reason,
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
convictions
of
these
defendants...
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--thank
you.
