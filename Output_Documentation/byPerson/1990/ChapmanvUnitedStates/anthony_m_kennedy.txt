justice
kennedy
well,
when
the
lsd
is
put
on
the
paper,
does
it
remain
a
microdot
or
does
it...
it
spread
to
the
boundaries
of
the
paper
if
the
paper
is
big
enough,
and
how
big
is
the
paper?
justice
kennedy
how...
how
big
is
a
square?
justice
kennedy
about
an
inch
square.
justice
kennedy
i
have
one
other
technical
question.
justice
kennedy
when
lsd
is
transported
to
this
person
who
is
going
to
put
it
on
the
blotter
paper,
i
take
it
it's
not
pure,
is
it?
do
you
have
a
pure
vial
of
lsd
that's
commonly
distributed
or
is
it
cut
when
it's
delivered
to
the
dealer?
justice
kennedy
perhaps
i
should
have
said
mixed.
justice
kennedy
well,
as
it
goes
to
the
person
who's
going
to
put
it
on
the
blotter
paper,
what
kind
of
container
is
it
in
and
is
it
mixed
with
anything
else?
justice
kennedy
are
you
saying
there's
a
standard
dose
of
lsd,
but
there's
not
a
standard
dose
of
cocaine?
justice
kennedy
i
mean
so
far
as
the
person
who
is
going
to
ingest
it?
justice
kennedy
but
he
can
vary
that.
if
he
wants
to
have
a
lot
of
cocaine
or
a
small
amount
of
cocaine,
he
has
a
choice
of
a
range
of...
we
might
call
doses.
but
that's
not
true
in
lsd,
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
kennedy
right.
in
a
consumable
form.
justice
kennedy
do
the
briefs
indicate
the
percentage
of
times
that
blotter
paper
is
used
for
distribution?
is
it
used
half
the
time?
justice
kennedy
does
the
literature
or
anything
that
we
can
rely
on
tell
us
that
blotter
paper
is
used
40
percent
of
the
time
by
distributors
or
20
percent?
justice
kennedy
i
think
we'll
leave
it
at
that.
you
say
they
tend
to
involve
blotter
paper.
is
what
you
mean
if
you
were
layman,
would
you
say
they
do
involve
blotter
paper?
