justice
o'connor
before
you
end
with
the
so-called
technical
questions,
i
didn't
understand
your
response
to
justice
kennedy
to
explain
what
happens
when
the
substance
hits
the
blotter
paper.
does
it
penetrate
into
the
fibers
of
the
blotter
paper?
justice
o'connor
so,
in
a
sense,
one
could
say
it
is
mixed
with
the
fibers
of
the
blotter
paper?
justice
o'connor
well,
in
some
sense
one
could
say
that.
justice
o'connor
but
if
it's
sprayed
on,
it
extends
to
the
full
extent
of
the
square?
justice
o'connor
are
you
going
to
address
your
constitutional
argument,
because
assuming
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
statutory
question,
i
suppose
that's
what
you're
left
with?
justice
o'connor
but
has
this
court
ever
thrown
out
a
legislative
sentence
on
the
grounds
that
you're
urging
here?
is
there
any
case
in
which
we've
done
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
would
be
true
for
cocaine
or
something
else,
would
it
not?
i
mean,
if
it...
if
as
you
increase
the
cutting
agent
and
decrease
the
strength
of
the
pure
cocaine,
you're
increasing
the
range
of
sentence
that
might
be
applied
here.
