justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
here,
mr.
lathram?
do
you
read
the
tennessee
supreme
court
opinion
as
holding
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
booth
violation?
it's
a
little
ambiguous
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
they
may
have
said
there's
no
booth
violation
here
at
all.
justice
stevens
and
so
if
you
found
no
booth
violation,
there...
we
really
wouldn't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
to
overrule
booth,
would
we?
justice
stevens
you
said
was
irrelevant.
i'm
not
sure
they
said
it
was
a
violation
of
booth.
justice
stevens
it
could
have
been
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
mr.
lathram,
suppose
he
hadn't
referred
specifically
to
the
child,
but
had
just
said,
you
know,
the
citizens
of
this
community,
when
they
see
this
verdict
come
down,
they're
going
to
ask
whether
justice
has
been
done.
they've
seen
one
of
their
members
brutally
murdered,
a
child
orphaned.
they're
going
to
want
to
know
what
quality
of
justice
you've
meted
out
on
behalf
of
the
community.
and
they,
you
know,
they...
they
want
severe
justice.
is
that
all
right?
justice
stevens
but
general
burson,
may
i
interrupt
you
at
that
point
because,
taking
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
as
justice
scalia
asked
your
adversary
earlier,
if
we
get
survivor
opinion
that
the
death
penalty
should
not
be
imposed
and
if
you
decide
that's
relevant,
then
it's
relevant
mitigating
evidence
and
it
must
come
in
under
lockett.
is
that
your
view?
justice
stevens
so,
just
to
make
sure
i
understand,
your
point
is
that
it's
permissible
for
the
prosecutor
to
put
this
kind
of
evidence
in,
but
not
for
the
defendant.
justice
stevens
but
it
is
entirely
the
election
of
the
prosecutor
whether
this
kind
of
evidence
can
be
received?
justice
stevens
but
the
state
could
decide,
as
a
matter
of
its
own
law,
that
we
will
receive
such
evidence
from
the
prosecutor
and
exclude
it
from
the
defendant.
a
state
could
do
that,
i
understand
you
to
say.
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
assuming
that's
the
decision
they
make.
justice
stevens
there
will
be
no
constitutional
objection
to
that
decision,
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
well,
what
would
be
the
constitutional
objection
then?
justice
stevens
so
then
you
are
saying,
if
a
state
adopts
a
rule
that
it
will
receive
this
evidence
from
the
prosecutor,
due
process
requires
it
must
also
receive
it
from
the
defendant.
justice
stevens
so
the
defendant
then,
in
such
a
state,
would
have
the
right
to
put
on
survivors
who
will
testify
they
do
not
think
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed?
justice
stevens
that
would
be
your
view?
justice
stevens
general
burson,
let
me
just
ask
one
other
question
similar
to
the
other
one
i
asked
you
about.
do
you
also
take
the
position
that
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
put
in
evidence
that
the
victim
was
an
unworthy
person?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
understand.
justice
stevens
but
you
would
say
that
if
the
state
puts
on
evidence
about
the
character
of
the
victim,
the
witnesses
could
be
cross-examined
to
test
the
credibility
of
that
testimony?
justice
stevens
they
could
do
that?
but
the...
but
it's
a
one
way
street
on
whether...
who
can
open
the
door.
the
state
can
open
the
door
with
this
evidence
but
the
defendant
could
not?
justice
stevens
right.
you
were
saying,
then,
really
flatly
in
disagreement
with
what
your
opposing
counsel
said
in
response
to
a
suggestion
i
made,
that
it
really
is
legitimate
to
value
victims
differently,
depending
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
lives
that
they
have
chosen
to
lead.
justice
stevens
right.
if
you
had
an
aggravating
factor,
that
if
you
are
the
father
of
a
family
of
four,
that
would
make
you
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
but
if
you're
a
single
parent,
you're
not...
it
would
not.
justice
stevens
if
the
victim--
justice
stevens
--unless
the
question,
is
there
a
principle--
justice
stevens
--is
there
a
principle
basis
for
drawing
that
distinction?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
last
question?
it
seems
to
me
your
standard
is
whether
the
evidence
would
show
that
the
victim
was
a
unique,
living
human
being.
i
think
those
were
your
words.
that
seems
to
me
to
assume
that
some
are
unique
and
others
are
not.
justice
stevens
no,
a
victim...
i
suggest
what
the
defendant
knows
about
the
victim
may
properly
come
into...
into
evidence.
this
is...
we're
dealing
entirely
with
evidence
that
the
defendant
did
not
know
about.
it
was
all
unforeseen
to
the
defendant.
justice
stevens
that's
all
booth
covers.
justice
stevens
well,
that
may
be.
maybe
that's
why
booth
doesn't
apply
here.
justice
stevens
does
not
that...
does
not
that
to
assume
that
some
human
beings
are
not
unique?
justice
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
do
you
take
the
view
that
it's
a
one-way
street
or
a
two-way
street?
can
the
defendant
introduce
evidence
that
the
victim
was
an
unworthy
person?
justice
stevens
but
you
would
take
the
view
it's
permissible
to
allow
it
by...
constitutionally
permissible--
justice
stevens
--to
allow
it
for
the
prosecutor
and
deny
it
to
the
defendant.
justice
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
do
you
understand
that
per
se
rule
to
apply
to
a
matter
that
the
defendant
knew
about,
or
are
we
only
talk
about
a
matter
the
defendant
could
not
have
reasonably
foreseen?
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
understand
booth
to
exclude
that
evidence?
justice
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
stevens
would
both
types
be
admissible
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
then
you're
saying
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
categories
that
justice
scalia
described?
justice
stevens
but
the
second
category
doesn't
show
anything
about
harm.
it
just
shows
he
was
a
real
nice
guy.
justice
stevens
no,
but
just
testimony
limited
to
the
fine,
moral
character
of
the
victim,
without
any
indication
of
harm--
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined,
and
i
have
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
which
i
shall
summarize.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
properly
admitted
at
the
trial
was
not
only
sufficient
to
prove
defendant’s
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
also
may
well
have
been
sufficient
to
convince
the
jury
that
the
horrible
character
of
this
gruesome
crime
warranted
the
death
penalty.
for
that
reason,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
concluded
that
the
victim
impact
testimony
given
by
the
grandmother
of
the
child
was
harmless
error.
this
court
granted
certiorari
not
to
review
that
holding,
but
rather
to
have
the
parties
present
argument
on
the
question
whether
our
recent
decision
in
booth
against
maryland
should
be
overruled.
not
surprisingly,
the
court
has
taken
that
action
today.
the
importance
of
this
decision
must
be
viewed
in
a
broader
perspective
than
the
facts
of
this
one
sad
case.
the
novel
rule
that
the
court
announces
today
represents
a
dramatic
departure
from
the
principles
that
have
governed
our
capital
sentencing
jurisprudence
for
decades.
until
today,
our
capital
punishment
jurisprudence
has
required
that
any
decision
to
impose
the
death
penalty
be
based
solely
on
evidence
that
tends
to
inform
the
jury
about
the
character
of
the
offense
and
the
character
of
the
defendant.
evidence
that
serves
no
purpose
other
than
to
appeal
to
the
sympathies
or
emotions
of
the
jurors
has
never
been
considered
admissible.
in
williams
against
new
york,
a
case
decided
in
1949,
this
court
considered
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
that
should
perceive
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence.
relying
on
practices
that
had
developed,
and
i
am
quoting
justice
black,
"both
before
and
since
the
american
colonies
became
a
nation",
justice
black
described
the
wide
latitude
that
had
been
accorded
judges
in
considering
the
source
and
type
of
evidence
that
is
relevant
to
the
sentencing
determination.
notably,
that
opinion
refers
not
only
to
the
relevance
of
evidence
establishing
the
defendant’s
guilt,
but
also
to
the
relevance
of
the
fullest
information
possible
concerning
the
defendant’s
life
and
characteristics.
victim-impact
evidence
was
unheard
of
when
williams
was
decided.
the
relevant
evidence
of
harm
to
society
consisted
of
proof
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
the
offense
charged
in
the
indictment.
as
the
court
acknowledges
today,
the
use
of
victim-impact
evidence
is
of
recent
origin.
in
so
far
as
the
court’s
jurisprudence
is
concerned,
this
type
of
evidence
made
its
first
appearance
in
1987
in
booth
against
maryland.
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case,
justice
powell
noted
that
our
prior
cases
had
stated
that
the
question
whether
an
individual
defendant
should
be
executed
is
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
character
of
the
individual
and
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
relying
on
several
recent
cases,
the
court
concluded
that
unless
evidence
has
some
bearing
on
the
defendant’s
personal
responsibility
and
moral
guilt,
its
admission
would
create
a
risk
that
a
death
sentence
might
be
based
on
considerations
that
are
constitutionally
impermissible
or
totally
irrelevant
to
the
sentencing
process.
evidence
that
serve
no
purpose
except
to
describe
the
personal
characteristics
of
the
victim
and
the
emotional
impact
of
the
crime
on
the
victim’s
family
was
therefore
constitutionally
irrelevant.
today,
however,
relying
on
nothing
more
than
the
dissenting
opinions
in
booth
and
gathers,
the
court
abandons
rules
of
relevance
that
are
older
than
the
nation
itself
and
ventured
into
an
uncharted
sea
of
irrelevance.
today’s
majority
has
obviously
been
moved
by
an
argument
that
has
strong
political
appeal
but
no
proper
place
in
a
reasoned
judicial
opinion.
because
chief
justice
burger’s
opinion
for
the
plurality
in
lockett
against
ohio
recognizes
the
defendant’s
right
to
introduce
all
mitigating
evidence
that
may
inform
the
jury
about
the
character
of
the
defendant,
the
court
suggests
that
fairness
requires
that
the
state
be
allowed
to
respond
with
similar
evidence
about
the
character
of
the
victim.
this
argument
is
a
classic
non-sequitur.
the
victim
is
not
on
trial.
her
character,
whether
good
or
bad,
cannot
therefore
constitute
either
an
aggravating
or
mitigating
circumstance.
even
if
introduction
of
evidence
about
the
victim
could
be
equated
with
introduction
of
evidence
about
the
defendant,
the
argument
would
remain
flawed
in
both
its
premise
and
its
conclusion.
the
suggestion
that
exclusion
of
victim-impact
evidence
results
in
a
significantly
imbalanced
sentencing
procedure
is
simply
inaccurate.
just
as
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
introduce
any
relevant
mitigating
evidence,
so
the
state
may
rebut
that
evidence
and
may
designate
any
relevant
conduct
to
be
an
aggravating
factor
provided
that
the
factor
is
sufficiently
well-defined
and
consistently
applied
to
cabin
the
sentencer’s
discretion.
in
its
ground-breaking
decision
today,
the
court
makes
no
effort
to
identify
the
limits
on
the
prosecutor’s
use
of
victim-impact
evidence.
the
premise
that
a
criminal
prosecution
requires
an
even-handed
balance
between
the
state
and
the
defendant
is
also
incorrect
because
the
constitution
grants
important
rights
to
the
criminal
defendant
and
imposes
special
limitations
on
the
state
that
are
designed
to
protect
the
individual
from
overreaching
by
the
disproportionately
powerful
state.
thus,
to
take
only
the
most
obvious
example,
the
state
must
prove
a
defendant’s
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
majority
attempts
to
justify
the
admission
of
victim-impact
evidence
by
arguing
that
consideration
of
the
harm
caused
by
the
crime
has
been
an
important
factor
in
the
exercise
of
sentencing
discretion.
this
statement
is
misleading
and
inaccurate.
the
statement
is
misleading
because
it
is
not
limited
to
harm
that
is
foreseeable.
it
is
inaccurate
because
it
fails
to
differentiate
between
legislative
determinations
and
judicial
sentencing.
it
is
true
that
in
evaluation
of
the
harm
caused
by
different
kinds
of
wrongful
conduct
is
a
critical
aspect
in
legislative
definitions
of
crime.
there
is
a
rational
correlation
between
moral
culpability
and
foreseeable
harm
caused
by
criminal
conduct.
but
the
majority
cites
no
authority
for
the
suggestion
that
unforeseeable
and
indirect
harms
to
a
victim’s
family
are
properly
considered
as
aggravating
circumstance
on
an
ad
hoc
case-by-case
basis.
the
majority
also
argues
that
its
novel
rule
is
appropriate
to
enable
the
jury
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
each
murder
victim
is
a
unique
human
being.
but
in
my
opinion,
the
fact
that
each
of
us
is
unique
is
a
proposition
so
obvious
that
it
requires
no
evidentiary
support.
what
is
not
obvious
is
the
way
in
which
character
or
reputation
in
one
case
may
differ
from
that
of
other
possible
victims.
evidence
offered
to
prove
such
differences
can
only
be
intended
to
identify
some
victims
as
more
worthy
of
protection
than
others.
such
proof
risks
life
or
death
decisions
based
on
the
same
invidious
motives
as
a
prosecutor’s
decision
to
seek
the
death
penalty
if
a
victim
is
white
but
to
accept
a
plea
bargain
if
the
victim
is
black.
given
the
current
popularity
of
capital
punishment
in
a
crime-ridden
society,
the
political
appeal
of
arguments
that
assume
that
increasing
the
severity
of
sentences
is
the
best
cure
for
the
cancer
of
crime
and
the
political
strength
of
the
victim’s
rights
movement,
i
recognize
that
today’s
decision
will
be
greeted
with
enthusiasm
by
a
large
number
of
concerned
and
thoughtful
citizens.
the
great
tragedy
of
the
decision,
however,
is
the
danger
that
the
hydraulic
pressure
of
public
opinion
that
justice
holmes
once
described
and
that
properly
influences
the
deliberation
of
democratic
legislatures
has
played
a
role
not
only
in
the
court’s
decision
to
hear
this
case
and
its
decision
to
reach
out
to
decide
a
constitutional
question
without
even
pausing
to
consider
affirming
on
the
basis
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court’s
rationale,
but
even
in
its
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue
involved.
justice
blackmun
has
joined
this
dissenting
opinion.
