justice
souter
mr.
lathram,
let
me
make
two
suggestions
and
get
your
responses
to
them.
the
first
is
that
whether
or
not
the
person
is
a
saint
or
a
reprobate,
and
whether
or
not
the
jury
is
told
about
it
really
isn't
any
more...
doesn't
inject
anything
more
arbitrary
than
the
fortuity
of
death
resulting
or
not
resulting,
it
seems
to
me.
he
performs
certain
dangerous
acts;
he
realizes
that
they
may
cause
death.
by
the
same
token,
he
realizes
that
if
he
performs
them,
the
victim
may
be
a
saint.
in
each
case,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it's
fortuitous.
the
second
suggestion
is
this.
isn't
the
real
problem
with
getting
into
the...
or
at
least
with
the
prosecution's
taking
the
affirmative
in
getting
into
the
character
of
the
victim,
that
it
implies
that
society
is
valuing
victims
differently?
isn't
the
real
problem
one,
almost
one,
a
kind
of
maybe
a
second-tier
equality
before
the
law
argument,
that
society
is
placing
different
values
on
their
victims...
on
victims?
justice
souter
is
that
an
eighth
amendment
concern?
justice
souter
the
valuation
itself
is
an
arbitrary
factor
because
it
is
insupportable.
is
that
the
argument?
