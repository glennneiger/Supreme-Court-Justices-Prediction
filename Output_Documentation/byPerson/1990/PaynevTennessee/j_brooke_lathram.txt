mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
most
prejudicial
conduct
in
which
the
prosecution
engaged
in
this
case
involved
what
i
believe
to
be
the
least
controversial
part
of
booth
v.
maryland.
i
refer
to
booth's
condemnation
of
survivor
opinion
about
the
sentence
that
a
capital
defendant
should
receive.
and
i
refer,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
to
the
prosecutor's
concluding
remarks
in
his
closing
argument
during
the
sentencing
trial.
in
the
course
of
that,
the
prosecutor,
in
effect,
demanded
that
the
jury
impose
the
death
sentence
in
order
to
satisfy
the
anticipated
desire
of
young
nicholas
christopher
for
payne's
execution.
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
in
this
case
no
witness
actually
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
they
wanted
payne
executed.
but
what
happened
here
was
much
worse
than
that,
i
respectfully
submit.
and
along
that
line,
i
think
it
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
if
we
were
to
allow
the
state
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
calling
a
witness
who
would
express
such
opinion
by
simply
allowing
the
prosecutor
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
for
the
witness.
in
this
particular
case,
the
prosecutor,
serving
as
the
surrogate
for
young
nicholas
christopher,
a
young...
youngster
for
whom
this
jury
undoubtedly
had
the
most
heartfelt
and
deepest
sympathy,
serving
as
the
representative
of
the
state,
did
three
improper
things.
he,
first
of
all,
demanded
payne's
execution
because...
for
young
nicholas'
sake.
secondly,
he
suggested
to
the
jury
that
this
was
a
permissible
basis
for
executing
an
offender.
and
thirdly,
he
engaged
in
a
form
of
psychological
intimidation
of
the
worst
kind.
he
strongly--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--oh,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
certainly
the
jury
is
going
to
have
the
most
heartfelt
sympathy
for
this
youngster
and
should.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
certainly,
your
honor,
i
think
they
would
definitely
have
outrage.
and
at
this
point,
they
had
already
convicted
him.
so
certainly--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
i
think
that
they
certainly
would
take
that
into
account,
and
are
entitled
to.
what
we
say
is
the
error
here...
it
would
have
been
wrong,
for
example,
your
honor,
for
the
grandmother
to
take
the
stand
and
actually
testify
to
the
opinion,
i
would
like
to
see
pervis
payne
executed.
by
the
same
token,
we
think
that
the
prosecutor
cannot
get
up
and
start
off
his
argument
to
the
jury
and
say
at
the
very
conclusion,
there
is
one
thing,
however,
you
can
do
for
young
nicholas
christopher,
and
then
go
on
to
say
that
the
little
boy
when
he
grows
up
is
going
to
demand
a
particular
type
of
justice.
he's
going
to
want
to
know
what
type
of
justice
was
done
in
this
case.
just
as
it
would
be
wrong
to
call
a
witness
to
the
stand
and
say
i
think
that
the
defendant
should
be
executed,
by
the
same
token,
i
respectfully
submit,
that
it's
even
worse,
under
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case,
to
have
the
prosecutor
testify
for
the
little
boy.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so
because
i
don't
think
we
can
impeach
the
verdict.
i
don't
think
we'd
be
able
to--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--i
don't
think
the
jury
should
consider
it,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
raise
a
problem
for
this
reason.
the
juror
is
thinking
on
his
own.
in
this
case,
we
have
the
representative
of
the
state
telling
the
jury
that
they
may
take
this
into
account
and
actually
execute
this
man
for
this
impermissible
reason.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
must
presume
that
the
jury
is
going
to
follow
its
instructions.
and
there
is
nothing...
and
the
jury
is
told
that
it
is
supposed
to
apply
the
collective
conscience
of
the
12
of
them,
and
they're
to
base
that
collective
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
and
on
the
basis
of
the
law.
and--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--your
honor,
it...
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
and
perhaps
i
can
get
my
point
across
by
asking
ourselves
this
rhetorical
question.
what
if
a
survivor
in
a
particular
case
did
not
want
the
defendant
executed
for
religious
reasons
or
whatever?
in
that
particular
case,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
an
otherwise
heinous
murderer
would
be
considered
to
be
less
blameworthy
or
less
deserving
of
the
death
penalty
just
because
the
victim's
survivor
felt
contrary
to
the
way
most
survivors
would
feel.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
must
be
excluded.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
i
do
believe
that,
your
honor.
i
think
the
trial
court
would
have
to
exclude
that
evidence.
i
think
that--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--your
honor,
to
me...
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
an
arbitrary
variable
that...
i
can't
imagine
anything
more
arbitrary
than
to
allow
an
offender's
fate
to
depend
upon
the
opinion
of
the
survivor.
i
think
that
the
mere
fortuity
that
a
survivor
wants,
for
religious
or
whatever
reasons,
wants
the
victim...
excuse
me,
the
defendant
to
be
spared,
injects
a
completely
arbitrary
factor
into
the
sentencing
determination.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
your
honor,
i
think
that
certainly,
as
this
court
has
held,
i
certainly
think
that
that
constitutes
mitigating
evidence,
because
that
is
something
that
the
jury
can
take
into
account
when
it
assesses
his
character.
his
character
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
jury
can
assess
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
should
live
or
die.
but
the
mere
fortuity
that
a
victim's
survivor
feels
one
way
or
the
other
about
whether
the
defendant
should
be
executed,
i
respectfully
submit...
first,
let's
look
at
it
in
terms
of
retribution
because
retribution
is
a
valid
penological
objective.
let's
ask
ourselves
this
question.
let's
assume
that
we
have
a
situation
where
the
victim's
survivor
does
not
want
the
defendant
executed.
would
society's
interest
in
retribution,
which
after
all,
is
a
punishment
for
an
injury
to
society
as
a
whole,
be
any
less
diminished?
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
that
society's
interest
in
retribution
is
just
as
strong,
even
if
one
of
the
survivors
comes
in
and
says,
i'm
a
very
religious
person
and
i
don't
believe
in
the
death
penalty
and
i
don't
want
this
man
being
executed.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
because
again,
i
think
retribution
is
a
punishment
for
an
injury
to
society
as
a
whole.
and
i
think
that
once
society
determines
that
particular
conduct
is
so
heinous
that
it
makes
someone
death
eligible,
that
the
defendant
should
not
be
allowed
escape
execution
simply
because
of
the
mere
fortuity
that
there
is
a
relative
out
there
that
some
defense
lawyer
can
find
who
will
come
in
and
say,
well,
maybe
i
don't
really
want
him
dead
after
all.
to
me,
that
injects
an
arbitrary
factor
into
the
whole
sentencing
process
that
i
think--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--your
honor,
i
characterized
it
as
the
worst
form
of
psychological
intimidation.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
what
he
did
is
he
painted
a...
of
course
he
didn't
need
to
paint
a
sympathetic
picture
of
this...
little
boy
because
one
cannot
imagine
a
more
sympathetic
victim--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
does
for
this
reason.
booth
condemns
survivor
opinions
about
whether
or
not
a
defendant
should
be
executed.
and
while
booth
dealt
with
a
case
where
the
survivors
actually
came
in
and
testified,
or
testified
through
the
vis
statement,
here,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
that
we
have
something
that
is
the
equivalent
of,
and
indeed
much
worse
than,
such
testimony.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--your
honor,
i
would...
if
i
may
respond
by--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--referring
to
what
he
said.
he
said,
this
is
the
very
end
of
his
concluding
remarks.
and
that's
significant
here
because
it
must
be
recalled
that
the
other
prosecutor,
at
the
very
end
of
her
rebuttal,
picked
up
the
butcher
knife
and
went
over
and
stabbed
the
diagram
of
the
little
boy,
which
shows,
i
respectfully
submit,
that
the
intent
here,
was
to
inject
as
much
prejudice
into
this
sentencing
trial
as
possible.
but
what
he
did
here
is
at
the
very
close,
he
said,
"but
there
is
something
you
can
do
for
nicholas.
"
"somewhere
down
the
road,
nicholas
is
going
to
grow
up,
hopefully.
"
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"he
is
going
to
want
to
know
what
type
of
justice
was
done.
"
and
he
certainly,
i
respectfully
submit,
was
not
suggesting
to
the
jury
that
they
go
back
to
the
jury
room
and
think
seriously
about
imposing
a
life
sentence.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
well,
your
honor,
i...
there
are
some
other
things
i
certainly
want
to
talk
about,
but--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--your
honor,
i
would
like
to
think
that
when
a
juror
brought
this
up
during
the
course
of
deliberations,
that
the
other
jurors
would
say,
we're
supposed
to
decide
whether
this
man
lives
or
dies
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
the
instructions
given
to
us
from
the
court.
and--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
your
honor,
payne's
counsel
at...
in
the
two
state
proceedings
did
not
object
to
this.
however--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
state
law
did
not
require
that.
state
law
allowed
this
to
be
raised
on
appeal,
and
this
federal
issue
was,
indeed,
decided
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court.
therefore,
i
think
that
what
we
have
now
on
the
books
is
a
tennessee
decision
which
will
be
precedent
for
other
offenders
in
tennessee.
so
therefore,
i
don't
that
the
failure
to
object
would
prevent
this
court
from
dealing
with
it.
but--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--not
at
all.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
barred
by
booth.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
i
think
booth
bars
what
this
prosecutor
did,
but
doesn't
bar
the
hypothetical
statement
that
you're--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
this
prosecutor
told
this
jury
they
could
do
something
that
this
court
has
never
even
intimated,
much
less
held
could
be
done.
this
prosecutor
told
the
jury
that,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
you
may
execute
this
man
because
this
little
boy
someday
is
going
to
grow
up
and
wants
you
to
have
executed
him.
that
is
in
effect
what--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
two
key
statements
here
are,
first
of
all
he
said,
"but
there
is
something
you
can
do
for
nicholas.
"
and
again...
then
he
goes
on,
now
what
is
that
something.
then
he
goes
on
to
say
how
nicholas
is
going
to
grow
up
and
he
says,
"he's
going
to
want
to
know
what
type
of
justice
was
done.
"
he
doesn't
say
he's
going
to
want
to
know
whether
justice
was
done,
he's
going
to
want
to
know
whether
or
not
you
executed
this
man.
and
here's
this
jury...
imagine,
i
can't
imagine
anything
more
difficult
than
being
on
a
jury
like
this,
and
already
knowing
what
has
happened
to
this
poor
youngster
who
saw
his
mother
killed,
who
saw
his
sister
killed,
who
was...
all
the
medical
problems
were
brought
out
in
front
of
the
jury.
here's
this
juror...
jury
thinking,
well
what,
you
know,
that's
a
good
point.
the
representative
of
the
state
has
now
told
me
that
this
is
a
reason
that
i
may
execute
someone
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
the
tennessee
supreme
court
opinion
is
ambiguous,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
i
thing
what
the
court
held
was
that
there
may
have
been
a
booth
violation.
in
fact,
i
think
that
the
court
held...
well,
the
court
held
that
the
grandmother's
testimony
was
technically
irrelevant
under
booth.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
it's
difficult
to
tell.
it's
within
the
context
of
a
paragraph--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--it's
possible
that
that
could
have
been
the
case.
but
then,
as
far
as
the
argument,
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
court
said
is
there
may
have
been
a
booth
violation
here,
but
we
believe
that
it
was
harmless
error.
i
think
that's...
again,
the
opinion
is
not
really
a
model
of
clarity.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
i
think
that
would
be
a
perfectly
permissible
argument,
your
honor.
but
i
see
a
marked
distinction
between
that
and--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--yes,
your
honor,
because
what
they're
asking...
i
can't
think
of...
again,
i
know
i'm
being
somewhat
repetitious,
but
to
me,
there's
nothing
more
arbitrary
than
to
allow
a
person's
fate
to
depend
upon
the
opinion
of
a
single
survivor.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
because
i
think
that
when
the
jury
applies
its
collective
judgment,
and
it
serves
as
the
conscious
of
the
entire
community.
and
i
think
prosecutors
often
tell
the
jury,
you
are
the
conscience
of
the
community.
that
gets
back
to
my
point
on
retribution.
retribution
is
something
for
society,
not
for
a
particular
individual.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
this
court,
your
honor...
and
i
think
this
will
respond
to
it...
this
court
has,
i
think,
in
booth
and
the
majority
opinion...
and
again,
i'm
separating
this
survivor
opinion
away
from
the
victim
impact,
which
i'm
going
to
come
to
in
just
a
minute...
but
this
court
has
never
intimated,
and
in
fact,
all
the
state
courts'
decisions,
i
believe,
and
this
is,
i
think,
brought
out
in
the
huertas
argument,
have
indicated
that
it's
improper
for
a
survivor
to
express
an
opinion.
and
it's...
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
and
i
could
be
because
i
don't
know
the
huertas
record
as
well
as,
perhaps,
i
should,
but
i
think
that
went
back
to
ohio
on
a
state
law
determination
that
the
expressions
of
opinions
like
this
are
impermissible.
now,
that's
ohio
state
law,
and
we're
dealing
with
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
no,
your
honor.
i
would,
and
i'm
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
here,
but
i
would
venture
to
say
that
no
state
does.
but
i
don't
have
anything
to
back
me
up
on
that.
i
just
can't
imagine
any
state
allowing
it.
and
i
do
think
it
rises
to
an
eighth
amendment
violation
because,
again,
the
best
way
to
answer
it
is
to...
is
to
focus
on
the
what
would
happen
if
the
victim's
survivor
said,
i
don't
want
him
killed.
to
me,
the
guy
is
just
as
heinous
and
the
need
for
retribution
is
just
a
great,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
defense
lawyer
is
able
to
go
out
and
find
one
witness
who
can
come
in
and
say,
well,
gosh,
i
have
some
problems
about
the
death
penalty.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
absolutely.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
i
think
what
the
court
said,
i
respectfully
submit,
that
what
the
court
said
in
lockett
was
that
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence
must
come
in.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
said
that
anything
a
defense
lawyer
can
dream
up
as
mitigating
is
allowed
to
come
into
evidence.
i
think
that
you
have
got
to...
there's
got...
in
order
for
evidence
to
be
relevant,
of
course,
it
must
assist
the
jury
in
deciding
one
of
the
issues
placed
before
it.
and
one
of
the...
the
issue
here
at
the
selection
stage,
is
whether
or
not
a
defendant
deserves
to
die.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
for
the
jury
to
decide
this
unbelievably
pressing,
important,
emotional
question
on
the
basis
of
whether
a
victim
happens
to
think
he
should
die
or
not,
injects
the
kind
of
arbitrariness
into
the
decision
that
this
court
has
frowned
upon
since
1972.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to
the
grandmother's
testimony
and
the
arguments
based
on
the
grandmother's
testimony.
we
were
asked
to
brief
the
question
of
whether
booth
should
be
overruled,
and
we've
done
that.
we
tried
to
answer
the
questions
raised
by
the
dissenting
opinions,
and
those
questions...
those
opinions
raised
very
tough
questions.
we
did
the
best
we
could.
i
think
our
reply
brief
did
a
better
job
than
our
first
brief.
let
me
preface
my
remarks
by
saying
that
i
would
never
come
into
this
court
and
endorse
a
position
that
would
invalidate
a
statute
that
enhances
punishment
on
the
basis
of
harm.
i
believe
very
strongly,
and
i
know
this
court
has
said
this,
that
legislatures
have
very
substantial
leeway
in
our
form
of
government
to
make
these
kinds
of
hard
choices.
and
in
fact,
i
think
that
anything
that
encourages
more
legislative
accountability
is
to
be
applauded.
and
i
certainly
recognize
that
this
court
does
not
sit
as
legislature
to
review
and
correct
unwise
policy
decisions.
my
concern
with
overruling
booth
can
best
be
summarized
this
way.
and
what
i've
tried
to
do
is
reconcile
booth
with
those
punishment
enhancement
statutes.
and
that's
what
we
tried
to
do
in
our
reply
brief.
and
i
think
i
can
express
my
concern
best
by
focusing
on
two
hypotheticals.
let's
take
the
air
piracy
statute.
and
let's
first
take
this
situation.
hijacking
number
1,
a
death
results.
hijacking
number
2,
because
of
a
mere
fortuity,
there
is
no
death
that
results.
i
think
booth
would
agree
that
the
statute,
because
that
is
the
air
piracy
statute,
is
valid.
and
i
certainly
would
accept
that
because,
after
all,
we
have
a
determination
by
society
that
the
crime
may
be
aggravated
because
of
the
harm,
even
though
the
hijacker
didn't
intend
the
harm,
and
the
hijacker
himself
was
not
the
one
directly
responsible
for
it.
again,
that
is
a
valid
exercise
of
retribution
by
our
national
legislature,
congress.
now,
let's
compare
that
with
this
hypothetical.
let's
take,
again,
two
hijackings.
and
let's
assume
that
in
both
a
death
results.
but
let's
assume
that
in
hijacking
number
1,
the
victim
who
dies
is
a
person
beloved
by
society
and
leaves
behind
several
aggrieved
survivors.
let's
assume
that
in
example
number
2,
the
victim
who
dies
is,
if
i
may
use
the
word,
a
reprobate,
who's...
who
doesn't
leave
behind
any
aggrieved
survivors
at
all.
my
concern
with
overruling
booth
is
raised
by
this
question.
is
hijacker
number
2
really
less
blameworthy?
is
he
really
less
deserving
of
death
than
hijacker
number
1,
simply
because
the
victim
was
a
reprobate
who
left
no
aggrieved
survivors?
perhaps
that's
a
policy
question,
and
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
that's
what
the
court
has
to
decide.
is
this
something
that
for
the
legislatures
to
decide,
or
does
this
introduce
an
arbitrary
variable
into
the
sentencing
determination?
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
my
big
problem--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--it's
exactly
the
same
except
that
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
society,
working
through
the
congress,
has
made
a
valid,
non-arbitrary
classification
of
death
eligibility.
we
are
not
trying...
what's
wrong
with
the
second
example,
i
respectfully
submit,
is
that
we're
letting
the
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
impose
death
depend
upon
nonspecific
variables
that
the
legislature
has
not
given
any
definition
to
and--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
well,
in
the
first
hypothetical,
all
the
jury
is
called
upon
to
do
is,
first,
determine
whether
a
death
occurred.
usually
that's
going
to
be
stipulated,
or
that
there
won't
be
any
dispute
about
that.
the
jury
doesn't
go
along...
doesn't
after
that
then
decide,
well,
i
think
death
should
be
imposed
because
the
victim
who
was
killed
in
this
case
happens
to
be
a
person
who
was
well
loved
by
his
family
members.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
your
honor,
it's
inconceivable
to
me,
and
perhaps...
maybe
it
should
be
conceivable,
but
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
a
defense
lawyer
could
come
in
and
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you've
got
to
consider
all
mitigating
evidence.
and
one
piece
of
mitigating
evidence
that
i
want
to
offer
is
this.
the
man
that
died
in
this
hijacking,
even
though
my
client
didn't
know
him
at
all,
was
a
reprobate
who
used
to
cheat
on
his
income
taxes,
and
who
used
to
cheat
on
his
wife,
and
was
basically
no
good,
and
wasn't
loved
by
any
family
members.
if
it's
going
to
be
open
season
where
we're
going
to
allow
defense
lawyers
to
do
that
type
of
thing,
then
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
we're
going
to
be
injecting
all
kinds
of
arbitrary
variables
into
the
sentencing
process
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits.
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
point
that
we
made
in
the
first
part
of
our
reply
brief
in
this
case.
i
think
that
when
society,
speaking
through
its
legislature,
has
a
valid
governmental
interest
for
making
a
classification,
whether
based
on
harm
or
based
on
victim
status,
such
as
the
peace
officer.
it
is
not
saying
that
one
member
of
society
is
worth
more
than
another.
all
it's
saying
is
that
we
have
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
in
extending
protection
to
peace
officers,
or
whatever.
but
when
we
allow--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
because
it
injects,
again,
an
arbitrary
factor
that
i
think
would
run
afoul
of
furman--
mr.
j.
brooke
lathram
--yes,
sir,
it's
the
nonspecificity
of
whether
or
not
somebody
has
led
an
exemplary
life
or
a
non-exemplary
life,
or
has
led
a
good...
is
a
good
person
or
a
bad
person,
or
left
behind
aggrieved
survivors
or
not
aggrieved
survivors.
