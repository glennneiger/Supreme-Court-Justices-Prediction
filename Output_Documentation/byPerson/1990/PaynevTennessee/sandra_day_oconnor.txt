justice
o'connor
mr.
lathram,
i'm
just
wondering
if
that
statement
that
nicholas
is
going
to
want
to
know
what
type
of
justice
was
done,
isn't
the
most
natural
response
in
the
world.
do
you
think
that
any
juror
would
not
know
that
a
survivor
some
day
is
going
to
wonder
what
happened
to
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime?
i
mean,
this
isn't
telling
the
jurors
something
they
don't
know.
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
that
could...
if
that
is
the
most
prejudicial
thing
that
happened,
then
i'm
wondering
if
there
was,
indeed,
any
prejudice.
justice
o'connor
was
there
an
objection
made
at
the
time
that
this
came
in?
justice
o'connor
and
yet
you
want
us
to
rule
now,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
a
new
sentencing
hearing
must
be
given.
justice
o'connor
it
just
seems
to
me
it's
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
if
there
were
any
question
about
it,
that
if
an
objection
were
made
at
the
time,
the
trial
judge
could
make
some
kind
of
statement
to
the
jury
and
tell
them
to
disregard
any
opinion
testimony,
if
that's
what
the
state
law
required.
but
to
come
back
later
and
say
there's
some
constitutional
violation
strikes
me
as--
justice
o'connor
--strange.
justice
o'connor
general
burson,
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
state
to
have
evidence
introduced
to
show
that
the
victim
went
to
church
every
sunday
and
never
took
a
drink?
i
mean,
is
that
the
kind
of
evidence
that
you're
arguing
should
be
allowed?
justice
o'connor
you
think
that
kind
of
evidence
should
come
in?
justice
o'connor
is
that
what
the
state
wants
to
do?
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
limiting
principle?
is
there
a
limiting
principle
of
foreseeability
of
the
harm,
for
example?
justice
o'connor
and
the
full
extent
of
the
harm
includes,
in
your
view,
the
personal
characteristics
of
the
victim?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
human
characteristics,
she
was
a
nice
mother,
she
always
took
them
to
sunday
school.
justice
o'connor
general
thornburgh,
what
if
the
state
legislature
hasn't
enacted
anything
relating
to
victim
impact
evidence,
but
the
prosecutor
wants
to
introduce
evidence
about
the
character
of
the
deceased?
this
was
a
good
church-going
person
who
never
told
a
lie
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
justice
o'connor
no,
my
assumption
is
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
relate
directly
to
anything
the
legislature
has
said.
justice
o'connor
well,
then
why
wouldn't
evidence
as
to
the
unsavory
nature
of
the
victim
be
relevant
as
far
as
the
defendant's
case
is
concerned?
justice
o'connor
well,
i'm
asking
you
though,
in
the
absence
of
state
law,
because
i
suspect
in
many
of
these
situations,
we
don't
have
a
directly
relevant
state
law.
we're
going
to
have
prosecutors
and
defense
counsel
out
there
wondering
what
to
do
and
how
far
they
can
go.
justice
o'connor
and
i'm
just
wondering
what
your
theory
is.
justice
o'connor
well,
how
about
pure
opinion
testimony
of
a
survivor
as
to
the
penalty?
