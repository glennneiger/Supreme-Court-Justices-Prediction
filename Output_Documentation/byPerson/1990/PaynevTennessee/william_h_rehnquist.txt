chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
90-5721,
pervis
tyrone
payne
v.
tennessee.
mr.
lathram.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
lathram,
that
the
jury's
feeling
of
sympathy
or
perhaps
outrage
at
the
crime
and
what
it's
left
the
victims
with
is
not
a
permissible
factor
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
outrage,
presumably,
if
the
facts
are
proven
against
the
defendant.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
his
fate
depending
on
the
fact
that
he
had
an
unhappy
childhood?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
a
prosecutor
forbidden
any
poetic
license
at
all
in
his
argument?
i
mean,
certainly,
typically,
you
are
arguing
a
case
to
a
jury,
you're
going
to
use
some
analogies
and
some
examples.
are
you
saying
that
he
simply
may
never
leave
the
cold
record,
even
in
his
argument?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
really
is
a
rather
strained
construction.
he...
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
look
at
what
we
have
of
the
record...
you
know,
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee...
he
dealt
with
the
facts.
and
in
a
closing
argument,
any
lawyer
is
going
to
get
into
a
few
rhapsodies
of
sort.
that's
the
way
people
argue
cases
to
juries.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
lathram.
general
burson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
sorry.
you
agree
with
opposing
counsel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
but
there,
you
have
a...
your
opponent
argues
that
that's
a
distinction
congress
has
drawn,
that
you
treat
the
harm
to
the
president
differently
from
other
people.
you
can
have
a
more
serious
penalty.
but
can
you...
would
it
be
permissible
for
a
statute
to
say
that,
a
father...
if
the
victim
is
the
father
of
a
family
of
four,
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed,
but
if
it
was
a
single
parent,
it
may
not
be
imposed?
would
that
be
a...
would
that
be
a
constitutional
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
burson.
general
thornburgh,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
thornburgh.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
90-5721,
payne
against
tennessee.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
the
first
degree
murder
of
a
mother
and
of
the
mother’s
two-year-old
daughter,
and
a
first
degree
assault
with
intent
to
murder
the
mother’s
three-year-old
son.
during
the
sentencing
phase
of
his
trial,
the
petitioner
called
his
parents,
his
girlfriend,
and
a
clinical
psychologist,
each
of
whom
testified
as
to
various
mitigating
aspects
of
his
character
and
background.
the
state
called
the
son’s
grandmother
who
testified
that
the
child
missed
his
mother
and
baby
sister.
in
arguing
for
the
death
penalty,
the
prosecutor
commented
on
the
continuing
effects
on
the
surviving
child
of
his
experience
and
on
the
effects
of
the
crimes
upon
the
victim’s
family.
the
jury
sentenced
petitioner
to
death
on
each
of
the
murder
counts.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
affirmed
rejecting
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
admission
of
the
grandmother’s
testimony
and
the
state’s
closing
argument
violated
his
eighth
amendment
rights
under
two
of
this
court’s
recent
decisions,
booth
against
maryland
and
south
carolina
against
gathers,
which
held
that
evidence
in
argument
relating
to
the
victim
and
the
impact
of
a
victim’s
death
on
the
victim’s
family
are
automatically
inadmissible
at
a
capital
sentencing
hearing.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
eighth
amendment
erects
no
automatic
bar
prohibiting
a
capital
sentencing
jury
from
considering
victim-impact
evidence
relating
to
the
victim’s
personal
characteristic
and
the
emotional
impact
of
a
murder
on
the
victim’s
family
are
precluding
a
prosecutor
from
arguing
such
evidence
at
a
capital
sentencing
hearing.
to
the
extent
that
they
held
to
the
contrary,
booth
and
gathers
are
overruled.
booth
and
gathers
were
based
on
several
premises
which
we
believe
were
faulty
as
the
basis
for
annunciating
a
constitutional
rule.
one
of
these
premisses
was
that
only
evidence
of
blameworthiness
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
is
admissible
at
the
sentencing
stage,
and
that
evidence
relating
to
harm
caused
to
the
victim’s
family
does
not
bear
on
that
issue.
the
victim’s
rights
movement
is
fairly
recent
in
the
law.
it
is
based
on
the
notion
that
in
the
process
of
apprehending
and
prosecuting
criminal
defendants,
the
interest
of
the
victim
and
the
victim’s
family
are
often
lost
sight
of.
the
victim
becomes
simply
a
statistic.
many
states
have
changed
their
laws
to
allow
the
sentencing
authority
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
crime
on
the
victim
and
the
victim’s
family.
the
united
states
constitution
is
not
an
evidentiary
code
for
state
criminal
proceedings
and
it
does
not
free
state
criminal
procedures
of
any
particular
moment
of
time
so
long
as
the
state
procedures
afford
due
process
of
law
and
do
not
violate
any
other
constitutional
provision.
they
may
change
with
changing
time.
in
fact,
assessment
of
a
harm
caused
by
a
defendant
has
long
been
an
important
factor
in
determining
the
appropriate
punishment
for
the
crime
and
victim-impact
evidence
is
simply
another
method
of
informing
the
sentencing
authority
about
such
harm.
particularly
in
the
light
of
our
decisions
in
lockett
and
eddings
where
we
have
held
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
most
broad
range
of
evidence
in
the
bearing
of
his
culpability.
we
think
it
is
not
unreasonable
for
the
states
to
wish
to
remind
the
jury
that
the
defendant
is
not
the
only
individual
to
be
considered
in
the
process
of
criminal
sentencing,
nor
do
we
think
there
is
merit
in
the
concern
voiced
in
booth
that
the
admission
of
victim-impact
evidence
permits
the
jury
to
find
that
defendants
whose
victims
were
prominent
in
their
communities
are
more
deserving
of
punishment
than
those
whose
victims
are
perceived
to
be
less
worthy.
such
evidence
is
not
generally
offered
to
encourage
comparative
judgments
of
that
sort,
but
it
is
designed
to
show
instead
each
victim’s
uniqueness
as
an
individual
human
being.
in
the
event
that
victim-impact
evidence
introduced
which
is
so
unduly
prejudicial
that
it
renders
the
trial
fundamentally
unfair,
the
fourth
amendment’s
due
process
clause
provides
a
mechanism
for
relief.
thus,
a
state
may
properly
conclude
that
for
the
jury
to
assess
meaningfully
the
defendant’s
moral
culpability
and
blameworthiness,
it
should
have
before
that
the
sentencing
phase
victim-impact
evidence.
