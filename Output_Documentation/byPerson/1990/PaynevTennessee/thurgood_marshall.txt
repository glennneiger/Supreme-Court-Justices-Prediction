justice
marshall
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
marshall
what
happened
to
the
old-time
theory
that
the
crime
was
against
the
state
and
not
the
individual?
justice
marshall
it's
about
gone,
hasn't
it?
justice
marshall
my
other
question
was
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
jury
was
shown
pictures
of
the
dead
bodies,
the
brutal...
blood
all
over
the
place,
and
everything
that
could
be
photographed
was
shown
to
the
jury,
and
practically
no
defense.
what
in
the
world
did
you
need
any
more
evidence
for?
justice
marshall
what
more
did
you
need?
justice
marshall
can
you
imagine
any
jury
not
convicting?
justice
marshall
you
mean
you
needed
more
than
a
bloody
body?
justice
marshall
well
then,
the
title
says
tennessee
v.
so-and-so.
so-and-so
against
tennessee,
doesn't
it?
justice
marshall
and
it's
a
tennessee
problem.
and
it's
not
the
child's
problem.
justice
marshall
will
any
other
member
come
in
and
talk?
justice
marshall
come
off
the
street
and
say,
i
don't
think
this
man
should
go,
i
think
he
should
be
killed.
you
can't
do
that,
can
you?
justice
marshall
xxx
that
what
you
want
to
talk
about?
do
you
really
want
to
talk
about
fairness?
justice
marshall
but
the
full
extent...
i
mean,
once
a
man
is
sentenced
to
death,
what
else
can
you
do
to
him?
justice
marshall
so,
you
don't...
full
extent
doesn't
help
in
this
case,
does
it?
justice
marshall
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
convey
is
that
you...
this
case,
they
showed
everything
necessary
to
bring
in
a
death
penalty.
and
then
they
added
this
on.
justice
marshall
and
anything
in
addition
you
can
think
of.
justice
marshall
well,
do
you
agree
with
me
that
there
was
enough
there
without
that...
the
bloodied
pictures,
et
cetera?
justice
marshall
well,
you
have
tried
other
cases,
haven't
you?
justice
marshall
well,
wouldn't
you
think
that
was
enough?
justice
marshall
xxx
overruling
booth?
do
you
agree?
justice
marshall
well,
why
booth?
justice
marshall
but
the
court
didn't.
the
tennessee
court
didn't.
justice
marshall
it
didn't
say
so.
justice
marshall
it
didn't
say
so.
justice
marshall
that's
right.
justice
marshall
and
we
have
to
go
this...
we
have
to
go
this
one
step
further
and
overrule
booth?
