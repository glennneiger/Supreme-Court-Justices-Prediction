mr.
charles
w.
burson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
booth
v.
maryland
and
south
carolina
v.
gathers
were
wrongly
decided
in
that
they
were
founded
on
the
flawed
propositions
that
victim
impact
information
may
be
unrelated
to
any
legitimate
sentencing
consideration,
that
its
inherently
emotional
appeal
will
shift
the
focus
of
the
sentencer
to
irrelevant
factors,
and
that
in
so
shifting
the
focus
of
the
sentencer,
it
will
result
in
the
arbitrary
imposition
of
the
sentence.
it's
the
state's
position
that
the
full
extent
of
harm
done
is
relevant
to
the
personal
responsibility
and
moral
guilt
of
the
defendant.
that
some
individual
characterization
of
the
victim
is
necessary
to
enable
the
sentencer
to
make
a
decision,
a
particularized
decision,
and
a
moral
decision
in
the
sentencing
process.
third,
it's
relevant
to
the
penological
objective
of
retribution.
given
its
probative
value,
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
it
inherently
invites
an
arbitrary
sentencing
decision.
indeed,
its
inconclusion
suggests
a
more
reliable
decision.
for
these
reasons,
this
information
should
not
be
precluded
as
an
eighth
amendment
proposition
on
a
blanket
basis.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
it's...
first
of
all--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--it's
our
position
that,
as
has
been
discussed,
that
is
not
present
in
this
case.
but,
in
response
to
your
question,
we
would
say
that
as
an
eighth
amendment
proposition,
it's
relevant
to
the
penological
principle
of
retribution,
as
was
suggested.
this
should
come
as
no
great
surprise
to
the
jury
that
the
survivors
would
feel
this
way.
now,
each
state,
again,
we
emphasize
as
an
eighth
amendment
proposition,
we
don't
think
the
basis
is
there
to
exclude
it.
each
state,
in
making
its
policy
decisions
and
weighing
whether
it
should
come
in
or
not,
that
should
be
left
to
them.
in
georgia--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--no,
sir.
under
lockett,
there
are
restrictions
to
the
mitigating
evidence.
the
mitigating
evidence
must
relate
to
the
character
of
the
victim,
the
record,
or
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
that's
our
point.
what
this...
what
evidence
seems
to
have
to
comport
to
is
the
former
line
of
cases,
which
narrows
the
jury
discretion,
the
lockett
line,
which
says
anything--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--no.
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
your
question.
i
would
suggest
that
then
runs
into,
perhaps,
a
gardner-type
problem,
that
if
the
prosecution
opens
the
door
by
putting
it
in,
that
then
the--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
think
that
is
a
decision
that
would
have
to
make
on
a
state-by-state
basis.
our
position
is,
it
is
not--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well,
they
have
to
make
that
decision
within
the
parameters
of
due
process.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
but
they
then
make--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
that
as
an
eighth
amendment--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--due
process,
gardner
v.
florida,
may
well
be
the
objection
then.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
think
that
would
be
a
possible--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
think
that's--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--where
that
takes
me,
and
in
fact,
georgia
in
the
rowe
mine
case,
did
allow
that.
in
fact,
reverse
on
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
didn't
let
the
defense
put
it
on
as
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
i
think
at
the
very
heart
of
our--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes,
sir...
no,
sir.
i
think
at
the
very
heart
of
our
proposition
is
that
we
are
looking
at
societal
harm.
we
are
not
just
talking
about
to
the
harm
to
the
individual.
i
think
the--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well,
i
think
the
point
is,
it
was
relevant,
it
was
probative,
and
the
trial
judge
made
that
decision.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
think
that
they
needed
a...
at
least
a
characterization
of
the
victim
as
a
unique
human
being,
other
than
just
as
a
corpse.
and
that's
all
i
think
the...
what
was
depicted
in
what
you
are
speaking
of.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
say
that
the
state
was
entitled
to
put
on
more
than
a
bloody
body,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
the
child
was
speaking
for
the
state.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
the
child
is
a
member
of
the
tennessee
society.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
think
that
that
would
probably
be
left
up
to
the
trial
judge
and
to
the
relationship
of
the--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
think
that
that
would
be,
again,
guided
by
our
concepts
of
fundamental
fairness
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--the
answer
is,
no,
because
we
think
that
if
you
do
not
overrule
booth,
that
this
was,
as
the
supreme
court...
supreme
court
found
harmless
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
but
we
do
suggest
that
the
information
that
came
in--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--we
say
that
booth
is--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes.
that
booth
is
broad
enough
to
cover
this
information,
with
exception
of
our
exception
about
the...
about
the...
the
statements
of
the
prosecutors
about
justice
being
done.
but
the
rest
we
say
would
be
covered
by
the
booth
and
gathers
principles.
at
the
core
of...
and
this
goes
to
our
point
about
the
reliability
of
the
decision,
it
seems
that
at
the
core
of
the
court's
focus
on
personal
responsibility
and
moral
guilt,
is
the
proposition
that
the
ultimate
choice
the
jury
must
make
between
life
and
death
is
a
profoundly
moral
one.
that
morality
is
given
expression
as
a
constitutional
principle
through
the
eighth
amendment.
its
meaning
at
any
given
time
must
derive
from
the
prevailing
standards
of
decency
in
the
society.
our
society,
through
its
state
and
national
legislative
bodies,
is
clear
in
its
message.
decency
and
morality
and
the
administration
of
justice
insist
on
relevant
victim
impact
information
in
the
sentencing
process.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
as
an
eighth
amendment
proposition,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
that
is
necessarily
prohibited.
our
point
is
that
this
is
not
precluded
as
an
eighth
amendment
proposition--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--in
that
what
a
state
should
be
entitled
to
do
is
balance
its
particular
legitimate
policy
interest
against
the
introduction
of
this
evidence.
for
instance,
a
state
may
well
conclude
that
to
allow
a
defendant
to
put
on
a
negative
societal
impact
evidence
without
the
state
opening
it
up,
that
that,
in
essence,
would
invite
open
season
on
victims.
and
that
balancing
that
interest
against
the
interest
of
fairness
in
the
trial
process,
the
state
may
well
conclude,
no,
we
are
not
going
to
allow
that.
they
could
cure
that
with
an
instruction.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i'm
suggesting
the
state
could
make
that
choice.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
what
i
am
suggesting,
and
i
think
it
is
a
significant
difference,
and
yes,
i
do
agree
with
counsel.
but
the
point
is
different.
what--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--no,
no,
no.
i
disagree
because
i
don't
think
what
we
are
asking
to
be
done
is
evaluation
of
the
worth
and
the
sanctity
of
a
human
life.
i
think
the
clearest
example
is,
if
we
look,
and
i
kind
of
hate
to
use
this
example,
if
we
look
at
the
president
and
we
look
at
a
homeless
person,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
sanctity
of
their
lives
is
equal
and
the
society
values
them
equally.
for
the
purposes
of
our
proposition,
there
further
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
taking
of
the
life
of
the
president
creates
much
greater
societal
harm
than
the
taking
of
the
life
of
the...
of
the
homeless
person.
so
it
is
in
looking
at
that
societal
harm
that
we
suggest
is
something
that
is
legitimate
for
the
jury
to
consider.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
are
we
speaking
now
as
a...
as
a
statutory
aggravating
factor,
because
i
think
there
is
a
difference
in
where
we--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--oh,
if
the
victim--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--is
a
family...
father
of
a
family
of
four.
i
think
that
that
would
depend
in
terms
of
defining
an
aggravator
whether
that
were
sufficiently
narrow
to
define
the
class
and
whether
that
was
a
sufficiently
principled
basis
in
which
to--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--name
an
aggravator.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
there
may
well
be.
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
expressed
and
looked
at
in
each
individual
case.
but
there
may
well
be
a
societal
difference
in
taking
the
bread
winner
of
four
children,
and
a
state
might
end
up
defining
that
as
an
aggravating
factor.
there
is
nothing
inherent
in
it
that
would
prohibit
it
from
being.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
think
the
principle,
justice
scalia,
would
be
that
if
it
is
too
broad
so
as
not
to
actually
narrow
the
class,
the
vagueness
of
it.
but
the
example
given
is
not
very
vague
and
i
would
say
you
have
a
fairly
limited
class
of
victims
there.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
the
type
of
evidence
that
we
are
arguing
for
is,
as
far
as...
again,
there
is
the
societal
harm
evidence,
which
may
be
embodied
in
a
particular
characteristic
of
the
victim.
but
there
is
another
reason
we
think
it
should
come
in,
and
that
was
pointed
out
by
the
chief--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well,
as--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--it
depends
on
how
far
it
goes.
it
depends
on...
what
we
are
looking
for
is
enough
to
flesh
out
that
this
was
a
unique,
living
human
being,
as
chief
justice
mentioned
in
mills--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--we
would
suggest,
no,
as
far
as
the
foreseeability.
we
have
suggested
that
the
personal
responsibility
of
the
defendant
extends
to...
it
goes
to
the
full
extent
of
his
harm,
and
that
is
very
much
an
objective
factor.
we
have
also
suggested,
however,
that
it's...
that
is
a...
to
the
extent
that
moral
culpability
and
that
mental
state
is
insisted
on
by
the
court,
that
moral
culpability
as
a
mental
state
embraces
more
than
subjective
foreseeability.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
it
may.
for
instance,
in
this
case,
the
fact
that...
charisse
christopher
was
a
mother
of
two
children.
that...
the
fact...
of
two
infant
children,
the
fact
that
she
was
a
mother
and
had
two
infant
children
is
an
individual
characteristic
that
does
reflect
the
additional
harm,
also,
to
society.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
think
those
human
characteristics
are
more
appropriately
viewed
as
to
whether
they
are
needed
to
paint
a
basic
picture
of
this
unique
human
being.
when
they
go
to
the
point,
when
they
go
to
the
point
of
suggesting
that
her
life
is
worth
more
in
terms
of
the
sanctity
of
life
than
the
life
of
the
defendant,
then,
we
think,
you
have
a
problem.
that's
where
the
line
should
be
drawn.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
yes,
because
i
think
that
this
was
determined
by
the
trial
judge,
and
we
had
arbitrariness
review,
proportionality
review.
so--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--we
would
suggest,
in
that
regard,
we
have
our
due
process
principles.
we
have
our
appellate
review
principles.
fundamental
fairness,
i
think
it
was
suggested--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well,
i
think
that's
just
one
of
the
points.
are
we
now
creating
a
new
standard
with
booth?
i
don't
think
this
was
the
intention.
maybe
it
was,
but
in
booth
and
gathers,
we
have
created
a
new
standard
at
a
very
low
threshold
for
prosecutorial
argument.
i
mean,
we
are
before,
where
the
serious
contention
is
being
made
that
those
references
to
justice
are
constitutional
error
under...
under
booth
and
gathers.
and
we
would
suggest
that
it's
up
to
the
states,
not...
not
as
an
eighth
amendment
proposition,
but
the
state
should
determine
the
degree
to
which
that
comes
in
and
balance
those
interests
to
these
substantive
factors.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i'm
not
here
to
defend
that.
that's
not
an
issue
we
would
suggest
is
before
the
court.
when
you
say
the
evidence
in
the
case,
i'm
assuming
we're
talking
about
all
the
evidence
that's
relevant--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--to
the
issues
before
this
case.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
i
think
this
goes
to...
i
think
this...
that
is
a
very
serious
question,
because
i
think
what
booth
and
gather
suggest,
contrary
to
what
we
have
said,
that
we
have
to
have
a
particularized
decision
on
the
defendant,
what
they
are
suggesting
is
a
generic
victim,
an
abstract
victim,
an
invisible
victim
at
the
sentencing--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
don't
think
in
this
case,
we
are.
i
think--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well,
i
think
that
booth
does
apply.
but,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
what...
if
it
wasn't
for...
if
it
wasn't
foreseeable,
we're
saying,
then
we
have
to
deal
with
a
generic
victim.
and
again,
i
think
i
mentioned
before,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
mills,
that
unless
we
have
a
basic
character
sketch,
something
to
let
us
know
this
is
a...
not
a
corpse
but
a
unique,
living
human
being,
the...
how
can
you
make...
how
could
we
make
that
moral
judgment?
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no.
what
it
assumes
is
that
our
present
standard
is
a
generic
victim.
