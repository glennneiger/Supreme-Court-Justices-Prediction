mr.
dick
thornburgh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
urge
overruling
of
booth
v.
maryland
and
south
carolina
v.
gathers.
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
cruel
or
unusual
about
the
jury's
consideration
of
victim
impact
evidence
in
the
sentencing
stage.
booth's
contrary
view,
however
wise
or
unwise
it
may
be
as
a
matter
of
social
policy,
is
simply
not
required
by
the
eighth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt,
instead,
a
rule
which
gives
due
weight
to
expressions
by
the
congress
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
state
legislatures
that
permit
consideration
of
victim
impact
evidence
in
all
cases.
victim
impacts
evidence
should
be
considered
in
capital
cases
to
ensure
not
only
that
the
defendant
is
held
morally
responsible
for
the
victim's
death,
but
to
hold
defendant
accountable
for
the
full
extent
of
the
harm
caused
by
his
or
her
criminal
acts.
we
echo
justice
blackmun's
observation
in
furman,
that
the
misery
occasioned
to
the
victims,
the
families
of
the
victims,
and
to
the
communities
where
the
offenses
took
place,
are
matters
which
perhaps
deserve
not
to
be
entirely
overlooked.
consideration
of
victim
impact
evidence
is
an
aid
in
determining
the
full
accountability
of
the
murderer,
does
not
risk
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
result
but's
indeed
rational
and
reasonable.
victim
impact
evidence
is
relevant
to
establishing
the
full
range
of
retribution.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
i
think
that's
a
matter
that
has
to
be
decided
by
legislative
bodies
or
in
a
particular
case
by
the
court.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
that's
a
constitutional
matter,
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
as
a
constitutional
matter,
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
depending
upon
the
delineation
of
aggravating
and
minimizing
circumstances,
that
might
well
be
admissible
within
the
confines
of
a
legislative
definition.
in
this
case--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--i
think
that
our
position
is
that
in
order
for
the
jury
to
hold
the
defendant
fully
accountable
for
the
extent
of
the
harm
that's
been
inflicted
upon
the
victim,
its...
his
or
her
family
or
their
community,
that
that
kind
of
evidence
is
properly
received
as
a
constitutional
matter.
there
is
nothing
infirm
under
the
eighth
amendment
about
receiving
that
information.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
i'm
suggesting
that
that,
again,
is
a
matter
for
state
law
and
there
is
nothing--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--my
own
sense--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--my
own
sense
is
that
the
defense
counsel
should
not
be
permitted
to
denigrate
the
value
of
the
life
that
already
has
found
to
have
been
taken
under
circumstances
justifying
death
sentence
eligibility.
that
the
characteristics
of
the
life
that's
been
taken
are
admissible
to
give
the
jury
the
full
picture
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
harm
that's
been
caused
by
the
defendant's
act
so
that
they
can
hold
that
defendant
fully
accountable
to
the
full
extent
of
the
harm
that's
been
done
to
the
family
and
the
community
and
the
like.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
opinion
testimony,
again,
i
don't
think,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
should
be
barred.
again,
i'm
not
terribly
sure
that
if
i
were
drafting
the
legislation
that
provided
for
these
kinds
of
situations,
that
that
would
be
at
the
top
of
the
list.
but
as
a
constitutional
matter,
i
don't
see
any
infirmity
in
having
that
opinion
on
either
side
presented.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
nothing.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
justice
marshall,
what
i
am
trying
to
convey
is
a
sense--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--we
would
suggest
that
in
making
the
determination
as
to
whether
a
death
penalty
eligible
defendant
is
to,
in
fact,
suffer
the
death
penalty,
it's
important
for
the
jury
to
have
the
full
picture
of
the
harm
that
was
caused
by
the
act
which
took
the
life
of
the
victim.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
not
anything
in
addition
you
can
think
of,
because
a
trial
judge
has
and
exercises
the
opportunity--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--i
didn't
try
the
case,
so
i
wouldn't
want
to
make
that
judgment.
but
i
know
a
prosecutor
wants
to--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--yes,
i
have.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
in
this
case,
i
think
the
prosecutor
properly
decided
to
admit
the
evidence,
to
sketch
for
the
jury
the
full
extent
of
the
impact
of
the
loss,
to
hold
the
defendant
accountable
for
that.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
because
i
think
booth
goes
to
great
pains
to
presume
harm
from
this
evidence.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
the
tennessee
court
followed
booth.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
but
found
it
to
be
harmless
error,
not--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--it
found
the
admission
of
this
evidence
to
be
error
under
booth
but
found
it
to
be
harmless.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
and
we're
suggesting
that
its
finding
of
error
is
error,
and
we're
urging
this
court
to
overrule
it.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
yes,
we
are.
there
is
another
factor,
i
think,
that
we
have
to
deal
with
here,
and
legitimately.
there
are
concerns
about
particular
cases
where
the
risks
posed
by
potential
inflammatory
or
prejudicial
evidence
may
be
offered.
but
we
are
suggesting
that
those
can
be
accommodated
by
the
kinds
of
safety
valves
that
exist
in
the
conduct
of
the
case.
judges
are
used
to
making
those
decisions
with
respect
to
prejudicial
evidence,
and
the
appellate
review
process,
which
offers
a
chance
for
that
judgment
to
be
clarified.
but
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
have
a
constitutional
rule,
per
se,
which
excludes
all
of
the
evidence
with
respect
to
what
the
impact
on
the
victim,
the
victim's
family,
and
the
victim's
community
was.
we
suggest,
also,
that
this
per
se
rule
is
really
unworkable
in
practice
because
some--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--clearly,
the
highest
case
of
culpability
is
on
matters
that
the
defendant
knew
about.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
no.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
in
order
to
assess
the
full
impact
of
the
act
that
the
defendant
carried
out
and
to
hold
that
defendant
fully
accountable,
it's
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
ambit
of
simply
what
that
defendant
knew
and
to
take
into
account
the
actual
impact
so
that
the
jury
has
the
full
picture.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
let
me
recast
that--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--let
me,
if
i
might
justice
scalia,
recast
that
dichotomy,
because
i
think
there
is
entirely
too
much
focus
upon
the
characteristics,
per
se.
but
those
characteristics
have
relevance
only
insofar
as
they
reflect
the
actual
harm
that
was
done
by
the
criminal
act
for
which
everyone
agrees
we
must
hold
this
defendant
accountable.
it's
not
the
characteristics,
themselves
but
what
has
resulted
from
the
death
of
that
individual
in
a
loss
to
the
victim,
the
family,
and
the
community.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
inadmissible,
and
no
one
supports
the
proposition
that
in
these
considerations,
the
characteristics,
themselves,
should
govern
the
determination.
but
insofar
as
they
reflect
the
degree
of
the
loss
that
was
suffered
by
the
criminal
act
carried
out,
that
they
are
inadmissible...
are
admissible.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
in
both
categories,
it's
not
the
characteristics
of
the
victim
that
govern--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--well,
that
could
have
been...
the
loss
of
that
life
could
have
been
of
great
harm
to
family,
friends,
community.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
well,
real
nice
guys
are...
the
loss
of
real
nice
guys
is
something
of
importance
to
this
community,
as
to
all
the
communities
as
well.
