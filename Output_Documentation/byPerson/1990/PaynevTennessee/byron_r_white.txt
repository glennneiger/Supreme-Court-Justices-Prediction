justice
white
they
have
outrage,
but
do
you
say
they
may
not
take
that
into
account
in
deciding
the
penalty?
justice
white
what
was
the
third
thing
the
prosecutor
did
that
you
object
to?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
this
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
booth,
has
it?
justice
white
no.
i
don't
know
that
the
prosecutor
didn't
say,
i
know
that
this
son
wants
him
executed.
he
didn't
say
that.
justice
white
all
he
suggested
to
the
jury
is
take
into
consideration
the
impact
that
this...
that
the
father's
death
has
had
and
will
have
on
the
son.
justice
white
go
ahead.
justice
white
do
you
think
the
prosecutor
would
have
been
barred
from
just
saying
consider
the
impact
of
this
death
on
the
son?
justice
white
you
don't
think
that
would
be
barred
by
booth?
justice
white
but
the
way
you
interpret
it,
you
think
booth
does
bar
it?
justice
white
well
now,
counsel,
what
else
in
this
case
is
arguably
barred
by
booth?
justice
white
general,
i
take
it
you
think
that
unless
booth
is
overruled,
you
are
going
to
lose
this
case?
justice
white
because
you
think
that
this
victim
impact
evidence
would
not
pass
muster
under
booth.
justice
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
white
but
you
say...
but
you
say
it
was
error
under
booth.
justice
white
whether
harmless
or
not,
it
was
error.
