justice
scalia
it's
funny
you
should
mention
that.
i
was
about
to
ask
you
what
if
the
defense
in
a
trial
wants
to
put
on
the
mother
of
the
victim
to
testify,
you
know,
i've
suffered
more
loss
than
anyone
in
this
case,
and
i
hope
you
won't
put
this
poor
person
to
death.
i
have
forgiven
him
and
i
hope
you
will
do
the
same.
must
that
be
excluded?
justice
scalia
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
know.
you
know
one
of
the
purposes
of
retribution
was
to
prevent
people
from
taking
law
into
their
own
hands.
you
go
all
the
way
back
an
the
state's
punishment
simply
substitutes
for
what
used
to
be
called
"weregild",
where
the
person
doing
the
injury
would
pay
money
to
the
family
of
the
person
harmed,
and
things
of
that
sort.
what
the
family
of
the
person
harmed
thinks
about
the
matter
on
that
theory
would
be
very
important.
certainly
one
of
the
purposes
is
to
prevent
people
from
taking
justice
into
their
own
hands,
saying
the
state
will
avenge
you;
you
need
not
avenge
yourselves.
and
if
the
person
comes
forward
and
says,
i
don't
want
to
be
avenged,
is
that
totally
irrelevant?
justice
scalia
between
that
and
referring
to
the
child.
justice
scalia
why
isn't
it
arbitrary
to
have
it
depend
on
the
opinion
of
the
community
or
my
perception
of
the
opinion
of
the
community?
justice
scalia
but
no,
i
may
be
a
very
kindly
person
and
opposed
to
capital
punishment
if
it
were
left
up
to
me,
but
i
am
told
by
the
prosecutor,
you...
you're
not
sitting
to
give
vent
to
your
own
feelings,
you
are
supposed
to
express
what
you
think
is
the
moral
outrage
of
the
community.
and
this
community
is
a
hard-hat
community,
and
we...
you
should
consider
whether
they
would
want
this
person
executed.
now,
that
kind
argument's
okay,
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
just
as
arbitrary,
as
you
put
it.
justice
scalia
i
agree.
how
many
states
do
permit
it
to
come
in?
frankly,
i
find
it
extraordinary
to
have
it
admitted.
but
that's
quite
separate
from
the
question
of
whether
it's
constitutional
if
a
state
wants
to
do
that.
how
many
states
do
do
it,
do
you
know?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
this
court
would
permit
the
exclusion
of
testimony
that
the
survivors
do
not
want
him
killed?
justice
scalia
we've
said
all
mitigating
evidence
has
to
come
in.
justice
scalia
why
isn't--
justice
scalia
--why
isn't
it
arbitrary
whether
the
death
occurs?
i
mean
hijacker
number
1
shoots
off
a
pistol
to
scare
the
people.
unfortunately
for
him,
the
bullet
ricochets,
and
kills
someone.
hijacker
number
2
does
the
same
thing;
the
bullet
doesn't
ricochet
and
kill
anybody.
as
far
as
moral
blameworthiness
is
concerned,
it's
exactly
the
same,
isn't
it?
one
has
caused
more
harm
than
the
other,
and
we
punish
him
more
severely.
justice
scalia
well,
but
wait
a
minute.
you're
letting
the
jury
in
both
cases
decide
whether
or
not
to
impose
death.
you're
allowing
the
jury,
in
either
case,
to
say,
well,
in
our
opinion,
he
shouldn't
get
death
anyway.
justice
scalia
well,
then
how
can
you
pretend
that
the
legislature
has
set
some
rigorous
penalty
that
mathematically
follows?
justice
scalia
they
can
take
into
account
any
mitigating
circumstance
and
decide
not
to
impose
death
on
the
basis
of
any
mitigating
circumstance
that
appeals
to
them.
justice
scalia
mr.
burson,
or
general
burson,
nothing
you've
said
goes
to
comments
concerning
the
views
of
the
victim's
family
as
to
what
penalty
should
be
imposed.
what
you
have
said
all
goes
to
how
many
children
were
left,
how
much
they
missed
their
father,
and
so
forth.
justice
scalia
but
not
to
what
penalty
the
father
wants
imposed.
justice
scalia
what
is
the
relevance
of
that?
justice
scalia
i
think
you
have
to
say
that.
i
mean,
surely
if
a
jury
can...
if
you're
going
to
say
the
jury
can
do
it,
i
think
you
have
to
say
the
legislature
can
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
thornburgh,
do
you
agree
with
general
burson
that
there
are
really
two
different
sorts
of
victim
impact
evidence
and
that
both
can
get
in?
i
mean,
one
is
really
an
aggravating,
you
know,
he
was
the
father
of
10
children
who
will
miss
him,
and
their
lives
will
be
harder
because
he's
gone,
and
therefore,
society
is
harmed.
and
the
other
one
is,
this
was
a
poor
reprobate,
never
did
a
lick
of
work
in
his
life,
but
you
know,
a
gentle
soul,
never
harmed
anybody...
just
to
humanize
the
victim,
not
to
show
any
greater
harm
to
society.
