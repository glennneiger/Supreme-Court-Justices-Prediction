justice
kennedy
so
suppose
a
juror
said
in
the
jury
room,
you
know,
some
day
i
might
meet
this
young
man
5...
young
infant...
5,
10
years
down
the
road,
and
i
am
very
concerned
about
what
kind
of
justice
is
done.
and
i
think
we
should
impose
a
death
penalty.
would
that
be
grounds
for
a
mistrial,
if
the
juror
said
that
in
the
jury
room?
justice
kennedy
well,
let's
take
the
hypothetical.
let's
assume
that
we
have
this
testimony
in
a
state
where
you
can
impeach
the
verdict.
is
that
improper
conduct
for
the
juror?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
jurors
can
and
will
and
do,
take
certain
matters
of
elementary
justice
into
account,
it
seems
to
me
proper
that
prosecutors
be
able
to
argue
about
it
under
the
supervision
of
the
court,
subject
to
the
rebuttal
by
the
defense
counsel,
and
that
it
is
just
only
realistic
to
allow
this
sort
of
argument.
justice
kennedy
well,
and
i
submit
that
a
juror
could
say
i'm
concerned
about
what
would
happen
if
i
would
meet
this
young
man
or
members
of
his
family
5,
10
years
down
the
line.
i
think
that's
an
appropriate
measure
of
the
kind
of
justice
that
we
hand
out
because
we
have
to
look
at
things
in
the
long
term.
it
seems
to
me
that's
perfectly
appropriate.
justice
kennedy
i
thought
any
mitigating
evidence...
this
is
mitigating
evidence
offered
by
the
defense.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
agree
with
you
that
opinion
testimony
is
a
troubling
issue.
i
just
think
that
here
you
can
interpret
this
as
nicholas
being
a
surrogate
for
the
whole
community.
i
have
problems
with
your
interpretation
if
it.
in
fact,
when
you
began
and
said
that
this
was
the
worst...
that
there
was
a
critical
item
of
testimony
here,
i
had
two
or
three
other
candidates
that
i
would
have
picked
out
of
this
record.
i
have
some
difficulty
with
this
argument.
justice
kennedy
do
you
think
that--
--[inaudible]
oh,
can't
speak
for
the
state.
this
is
the
state
of
tennessee.
right?
justice
kennedy
laying
aside,
for
the
moment,
the
constitutional
considerations,
just
from
the
standpoint
of
your
expertise
as
an
attorney
general
and
as
a
prosecutor,
would
you
recommend
that
every
state
in
the
union
permit
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
in
this
record?
justice
kennedy
my
concern
is
that
prosecutors
tend
to
go
to
the
very
limits
of
the
law.
i
don't
know
if
you
had
the
opportunity
to
read
the
record
in
huertas
v.
ohio,
in
which
the
aggrieved
mother
or
grandmother
testified
as
to
the
appropriate
penalty.
and
if
we
overrule
booth
v.
gathers,
we
are
going
to
have
testimony
that
is
of
this
very,
very
emotional
and
potentially
prejudicial
nature.
justice
kennedy
we
have
had
no
case
that
i
recall
in
which
we
have
set
aside
a
death
verdict
for
inflammatory...
inflammatory
arguments
by
the
prosecutor.
we
have
come
close
to
that.
we
have
said
that
there
is
a
due
process
component.
justice
kennedy
incidentally,
just
to
make
the
record
clear,
i
take
it
you
don't
defend
the
stabbing
of
the
diagram?
justice
kennedy
that
was
the
meaning
of
my
question.
