mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
narrow
statutory
question
of
whether
the
national
labor
relations
act
permits
the
board
to
establish
a
rule
determining
that
eight
specific
bargaining
units,
and
only
those
units,
are
appropriate
for
every
acute
care
hospital
in
the
united
states.
we
believe
that
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
section
9(b)
of
the
act,
as
well
as
the
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
the
act
by
the
board,
make
it
clear
that
the
rule
is
not
permitted.
section
9(b)
requires
that
the
board
determine
the
appropriate
unit
in
each
case.
the
board
and
the
unions
argue
that
those
words
refer
solely
to
the
proceeding
in
which
the
board
is
to
issue
unit
determinations.
in
their
view,
as
long
as
the
board
goes
through
the
formality
of
the
hearing
the
requirements
of
the
statute
are
met,
even
if
that
formality
is
an
empty
one
leading
in
every
case
to
the
same
preordained
result.
of
course
section
9(c)
already
requires
hearings
in
contested
representation
cases,
so
in
the
board's
view
the
"in
each
case"
language,
which
was
added
deliberately
by
amendment
to
the
wagner
bill,
adds
nothing
to
the
statute.
well,
those
words
do
mean
something,
and
their
meaning
is
demonstrated
not
only
by
the
words
themselves,
but
by
both
the
legislative
history
of
section
9(b)
and
the
board's
contemporaneous
and
longstanding
interpretation
of
that
section.
the
statutory
language
and
its
history
were
clear
enough
in
1980
and
again
in
1982
for
the
board
itself
to
hold
that
the
adoption
of
a
rule
that
a
unit
of
registered
nurses
would
be
appropriate
in
every
case
would
be,
quote,
9(b)
responsibility
to
decide
in
each
case
whether
the
requested
unit
is
appropriate.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
sure.
well,
the
board
is
making
that
argument.
they're
arguing
that
the
extraordinary
circumstances
exception
allows
it
to
consider
in
each
case
whether
there
are
exceptions
allowing
a
different
result
from
the
rule.
but
the
extraordinary
circumstances
exception,
which
the
board
did
not
say
in
its
rulemaking
allowed
case-by-case
determination
of
the...
of
each
case,
in
fact
it
did
not
rely
on
the
extraordinary
circumstances
exception
for
the
purpose
now
asserted
by
the
board,
that
exception
is
so
narrow
as
to
be
illusory.
the
board
has
made
it
clear
in
the
rulemaking
that
it
will
no
longer
consider
the
individual
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
hospital,
and
it
will
disregard
all
of
the
factors
it
regards
as
critical
in
every
other
industry,
and
that
it
always
regarded
as
critical
in
this
industry.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
believe
that
this
is
the
first
substantive
rule
they
have
adopted.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
right.
it's
not
the
procedural
rules.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
correct.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
have
no
problem
with
that
because--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--no.
there
are
two
distinctions
that
we're
making
here.
first
of
all,
we're
not
arguing
that
the
board
erred
by
engaging
in
rulemaking
rather
than
adjudication.
in
fact
we
think
the
rule
would
suffer
from
exactly
the
same
defect
and
we
would
be
making
exactly
the
same
arguments
if
it
had
been
announced
in
adjudication.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
would
make
the
same
statutory
argument
if
they
established
a
rule
saying
that
these
eight
units
are
appropriate
in
every
case,
and
that
we
will
not
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
hospitals
in
subsequent
cases.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
there
are
two
differences.
first
of
all,
the
9(b)
does
not
apply
to
labor,
to
unfair
labor
practices.
section
9(b)
says,
and
only
says,
that
the
board
shall
determine
the
appropriate
unit
in
each
case.
it
doesn't
say
that
it
shall
determine
unfair
labor
practices
in
each
case.
now
the
board
has
established
bargaining
unit
rules
in
adjudication,
and
the
board
is
now
arguing
that
the
rule
that
it
has
established
in
this
industry
is
much
the
same
as
those
rules.
but
that's
not
correct.
in
no
other
industry
has
the
board
established
a
rule
that
particular
units
and
only
those
units
will
be
appropriate
in
each
and
every
case.
and
that's
what
violates
the
"in
each
case"
requirement.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
no,
the
board
never
said
that
it,
that
it
would
approve
or
would
not
approve
any
particular
number
of
units.
it
has
changed
the
test
at
times.
at
times
it
followed
the
community
of
interest
tests
that
it
follows
in
all
other
industries.
at
times
it
switched
to
a
disparity
of
interests
test,
but
that
test
did
not
result
in
a
set
number
of
units
being
appropriate
in
each
and
every
case.
in
each
and
every
case
the
board
applied
that
test,
looked
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
individual
hospital,
and
decided
whether
under
those
facts
and
circumstances
the
particular
unit
that
was
before
the
board
was
appropriate
or
not
appropriate.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
right,
a
rule--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--that's
right.
and
the
board
could
establish
a
disparity
of
interest
test
and
say
we
will
decide
in
each
case
whether
under
the
disparities
of
interest
test
this
unit,
the
unit
that's
being
sought
in
this
particular
proceeding,
is
appropriate.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
don't
think
it
would
ever
know
that
the
outcome
of
that
test
would
only
be
eight
appropriate
units
or
four
appropriate
units.
the
test
would
establish
a
standard,
and
each
hospital
would
be
free
to
introduce
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
that
particular
hospital
to
try
to
convince
the
board
that
under
those
facts
and
circumstances
the
particular
unit
before
it
was
inappropriate.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
if
the
board
believes
that,
i
think
it's
free
to
say
we
think
that...
we
will
presume
that
these
eight
units
might,
will
be
correct
in
each
and
every
case.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
no.
it
can't
do
it...
it
can
do
it
in
adjudication
or
in
rulemaking,
provided
that
it
allow
each
employer
in
each
case
to
introduce
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
that
particular
employer
to
convince
the
board
that
in
that
case
that
rule
should
not
apply.
the
"in
each
case"
language
requires
case-by-case
evaluation
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
particular
bargaining
unit.
that's
what
we're
arguing.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
oh
yes,
it
can
establish
general
principles.
in
fact
it
can
establish
the
same
kinds
of
principles
that
it
has
established
in
other
industries.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
right.
what
the
board
has
done
here
is
it
has
said
that,
first
of
all
it
said
in
its
rulemaking
that
all
of
the...
that
as
to
all
of
these
factors
it
lists
in
its
extraordinary
exceptions
exception...
extraordinary
circumstances
exception,
hospitals
don't
vary
in
these
respects.
but
to
the
extent
they
do,
we
find
that
we're
better
off
ignoring
those
variations,
because
the
value
of
having
a
uniform
rule
outweighs
the
value
of
considering
in
each
case
whether
that
bargaining
unit
is
appropriate.
we
don't
think
that's
proper.
we
think
the
board
has
to
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case
to
decide
whether
its
rule
is
properly
applied
to
that
case.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
correct.
it
cannot
have
a--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--it
can't
have
an
exclusive
presumption,
period,
no
matter
what
the
interest
is.
the
board
has...
the
congress
has
determined
by
putting
in
this
"in
each
case"
language,
which
otherwise
would
be
completely
redundant
and
meaningless,
that
the
board
must
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case,
as
long
as
they
do
that.
now,
the
board
has,
has
argued
or
has
written
over
the
years
that
that's
exactly
what,
what
this
rule
requires.
it
said
so
in
adjudications
in
1980
and
1982,
and
in
1935,
when
the
act
was
first
being
considered,
congress
explained
that
the
question
of
what
bargaining
unit
is
appropriate
is,
quote,
"obviously
one
for
determination
in
each
individual
case.
"
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
sure.
and
in
each
case
you
would
think
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
make
that
presumption...
to
make
that
election.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
think
that's
correct.
it
also
is
helped
by
the
fact
that
the
extent
of
organization
is
not
supposed
to
be
conclusive.
in
each
case
the
board
is
supposed
to
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
particular
hospital
to
decide
whether
the
unit
at
issue
is
or
is
not
an
appropriate
unit.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
as
far
as
professionals
go,
yes.
there
would
have
to
be...
the
professional
employees
would
have
to,
would
have
to
accept
that.
there
is
one
meaningful
exception
to
this
entire
rule.
that
exception
provides
that
if
unions
request
that
one
or
more
of
these
units
be
combined,
one
or
more
of
these
eight
units
be
combined,
that
will
ordinarily
be
considered
appropriate.
but
if
an
employer
requests
that,
that
will
be
inappropriate
in
every
case.
so
i
would
assume
that
if
a
union
came
in
and
says
we
want
a
combined
professional
and
nonprofessional
unit
in
this
case,
the
election
procedures,
the
consent
procedures
would
still
apply,
and
such
a
combined
unit,
if
appropriate,
would
be
allowed.
of
course,
if
an
employer
sought
that
it
would
not
be
allowed
in
any
case.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
they
are
not
considering
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
only
situation
in
which
they
will
consider
that
is
when
the
unions
come
in
and
request
a
combined
unit.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
don't
think
that's
all
you
need.
i
think
9(b),
and
what
congress--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--excuse
me?
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
if
the
unions
request
an
addition,
a
combination
of
units,
that
can
be
allowed.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
comports
with
the
"in
each
case"
requirement.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
think
the
"in
each
case"
requirement
requires
the
board,
not
the
unions
but
the
board,
to
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case,
including
the
employer's
argument
that
because
of
the
staffing
patterns,
supervision,
contacts
between
employees,
and
so
forth,
that
this
particular
unit
is
inappropriate
or
appropriate.
and
that
can't
be
done
under
this
rule.
the
employer
could
never
offer
that
evidence.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
it
could
adopt
a
general
principle
saying
that
we
might
presume
that
all
of
these
units
will
be
appropriate
units,
but
the
board...
the
employer
or
other
parties
before
the
board
would
still
have
to
have
the
opportunity
in
each
case
to
convince
the
board
that
that
unit
is
appropriate.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
board
does
in
every
other
industry.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
i
think
there
would
be
some
problem
if
the
board
were
saying
that
this
is
just
the
standard
of
relevance.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
first
that
that's
not
what
the
board
has
done
here.
it
didn't
find
that
these
factors
are
irrelevant.
it
found
instead
that
for
the
most
part
hospitals
don't
vary
in
the
various
respects
that
the
board
talked
about,
and
that
to
the
extent
they
do
vary,
which
they
acknowledged,
the
value
of
having
a
uniform
rule
outweighed
the
value
of
considering
those
factors.
if
the
board
had
determined
that
all
of
the
factors
that
it
always
considers
in
every
other
industry
were
irrelevant
and
didn't
change
its
mind,
i
don't
think
that
determination,
frankly,
could
survive
scrutiny.
these
are
the
factors
that
the
board
considers
relevant
in
every
other
industry,
and
that
it
has
considered
relevant
in
hospital
cases
for
the
last
17
years.
in
case
after
case
applying
these
factors,
the
board
has
found
that
one
or
another
of
the
units
that
are
now
before
it
and
that
are
now
deemed
to
be
appropriate
in
every
case,
were
in
fact
inappropriate,
and
have
held
that
those
units
would
not
be
allowed.
now,
for
them
to
suddenly,
after
making
all
these
decisions
over
the
years
under
both
the
disparity
of
interest
standard
and
the
community
of
interest
standard,
for
them
to
suddenly
decide
no,
these
are
no
longer
relevant,
i
don't
think
that
could
survive
scrutiny.
but
that's
not
what
they
have
done
in
this
case.
what
they
have
done
in
this
case
is
say
they
don't
vary
in
these
respects,
mostly,
but
to
the
extent
they
do
vary
in
these
respects
we're
not
going
to
consider
that.
we
no
longer
think
that
that
variation
is
something
we
have
to
think
about.
we
think,
instead,
that
the
value
of
a
uniform
rule
outweighs
that.
well,
that
might
be
so,
and
i
think
that
that
might
be
an
interest
that
is
recognized
in
most
rulemaking,
but
it's
an
interest
that
congress
foreclosed
by
requiring
the
board
to
decide
in
each
case
that
the
particular
bargaining
unit
is
appropriate.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
it
does.
exactly.
it
refuses
to
decide...
well,
to
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
a
particular
hospital
in
deciding
whether
one
of
the
eight
units
is
appropriate.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
correct.
the
board
has
decided
that
the
value
of
uniformity,
the
value,
the
efficiency
that
comes
from
uniformity,
and
that's
what
it
says
in
its
rulemaking,
outweighs
the
desire
to
engage
in
case-by-case
determination
in
those
cases.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
right.
exactly.
and
in
fact,
the
extraordinary
circumstances--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--i
think
that
they
have
found--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--i
think
it's
administrative
efficiency.
as
we
know,
and
we
can
understand
the
board's
frustration
in
this
case,
over
13
years
the
board
lost
case
after
case
in
this
area.
the
courts
of
appeals
kept
refusing
to
enforce
case
after
case
involving
unit
determinations.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
right.
i
would
hope
so.
[laughter]
the
board
in
its
extraordinary
exceptions
rationale...
explanation
includes
a
long
list
of
factors
that
it
will
no
longer
consider
as
appropriate,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
not
only
are
these
factors
inappropriate,
but
everything
we
have
ever
seen
in
13
years
of
adjudicating
these
cases
are
inappropriate,
even
though
in
many
of
those
adjudications
the
board
found
that
a
unit
or
more
than
one
unit
that
it
now
designates
as
appropriate
was
inappropriate.
we
won't
even
think
about
these
factors
anymore.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
they
want
the
value
of
a
rule,
right.
they
want
to
save
time.
they
want
administrative
efficiency.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
administrative
efficiency
might
not
be
a
suitable
value.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
administrative
efficiency
and
that
kind
of
exercise
of
administrative
efficiency
is
foreclosed
by
section
9(b)
and
by
the
requirement
that
the
board
has
acknowledged
over
the
years,
that
congress
has
acknowledged
over
the
years,
that
section
9(b)
requires
case-by-case
determinations.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
suspect
that
if
they
made
that
thing
i
would
be
here,
but
i
would
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
table.
[laughter]
i
strongly
suspect
the
afl-cio
would
be
here
saying
that
this
rule
violates
the
"in
each
case"
requirement.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
in
that
case
certainly
the
interests
of--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--the
interests
of
the
aha
might
favor
such
rule,
but
on
the
other
hand
i
would
have
to
submit
that
the
"in
each
case"
language
prohibits
that
kind
of
uniform
rule
as
well.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
even
if
it
had
one
unit
or
two
units
or
the
statutory
minimum
of
three
units,
professional,
nonprofessional,
and
guard.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
employees
cannot
agree
upon
a
unit,
no.
there
is
a
procedure
where
if
the
employer
and
the
union
seeking
the
unit
agree,
that
the
board
will
ordinarily
agree
to
that
unit,
provided
it's
not
clearly
inappropriate
or
violates
the
statute.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
it
generally
doesn't
work
that
way,
although
if,
if
a
union
and
an
employer
says
we
want
it,
that
would
be
one
thing.
although
still
there
are
some
standards,
like
the
professional/nonprofessional
standard,
that
the
board
has
to
work
from,
and
it
has
to
determine
whether
the
unit
is
appropriate.
if
the
employer
and
the
union,
and
the
unions
agree
that
this
is
an
appropriate
union...
unit,
we'll
have
an
election,
the
board
ordinarily
will
go
ahead
with
that.
but
it
can
determine
that
that's
inappropriate.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
believe
that
was
correct.
in
fact
most,
much
of
that
explanation
occurred
during
the
rulemaking
proceeding
when
the
board
was,
when
the
american
hospital
association,
once
the
board
decided
to
engage
in
rulemaking,
decided
it
was
going
to
get
the
best
rule
it
possibly
could.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--well,
let
me
respond
in
two
different
ways.
first
of
all,
the
"in
each
case"
requirement
requires
case-by-case
consideration
of
bargaining
units,
and
if
the
american
hospital
association
took
a
contrary
position
and
made
an
argument
that
is
contrary
to
what
the
statute
means,
the
american
hospital
association
was
wrong.
secondly,
a
uniform
rule
or
a
uniform...
that's
right,
a
uniform
rule
or
a
uniform
policy
does
not
have
to
be
a
conclusive
presumption.
it
doesn't
have
to
say
we
will
regard
these
units
as
appropriate
in
each
and
every
case,
regardless
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case.
a
uniform
rule
can
allow
for
meaningful
exceptions,
which
is
not
what
this
rule
does.
in
fact
a
uniform
rule
can
be
like
the
rules
that
the
board
has
established
in
other
industries.
in
no
other
industry
has
the
board
established
a
rule
that
particular
units
and
only
those
particular
units
will
be
appropriate
in
every
case.
in
those
few
industries
where
the
board
has
established
presumptions,
employers
are
given
the
full
opportunity
to
rebut
those
presumptions
and
to
show
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
a
particular
workplace
warrant
a
different
result.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
that.
i
assume
that
there
has
been
litigation
in
some
industries,
but
there
has
never
been
a
rulemaking
like
this.
and
also,
our
industry
had
a
much
different
history
than
other
industries.
our
industry
was
not
covered
by
and
large
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
at
least
the
dominant
nonproprietary
sector
was
not
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
until
1974,
at
least
between
1947
and
1974.
and
the
announcement
that
it
would
suddenly
cover
did
give
rise
to
an
increased
amount
of
litigation.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
other
industries
have
litigation
over
units
and
appropriate
units
over
the
years.
but
in
all
those
other
cases
the
employer
is
allowed
to
offer
evidence
to
rebut
the
presumption
and
to
show
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
particular
workplace
warrant
a
different
result.
there
is
no
such
possibility
under
the
board's
rule,
and
the
board
emphasized
in
its
rulemaking
that
it
was
not
merely
establishing
rebuttable
presumptions
that
the
eight
units
were
correct.
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
acceptance
of
our
argument
would
not
mean
that
those
other
vastly
different
rules
would
be
invalid.
when
those
other
rules
are
applied,
the
board
continues
to
give
case-by-case
consideration
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
employer
and
to
comply
with
the
"in
each
case"
requirement.
we're
not
engaging
in
any
broad
attack
on
presumptions
or
upon
the
board's
rulemaking
authority.
we're
merely
making
the
argument
that
in
this
one
area,
where
the
statute
requires
case-by-case
consideration,
the
board
must
take
into
account
the
circumstances
of
each
employer
and
cannot
adopt
rules
that
eliminate
that
consideration.
now,
our
argument,
in
addition
to
the
original
language
and
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--well,
in
other
industries
the
cases
are
won
quite
often,
and
i
think
we
would
win
cases
quite
often
if
the
facts
and
circumstances
showed
that
a
different
unit
was
appropriate--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--that's
right.
that's
right.
and
i
think
we
would
be
able
to
that.
and
i
think
we
would
be
able
to
do
that
in
numerous
cases.
now
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
in
those
circumstances
the
board--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--extraordinary
circumstances.
yes.
extraordinary
circumstances
is
an
empty
exception.
here
the
board
says
that
all
of
the
factors--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--because
the
board
says
it
is.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
the
board
has
said,
the
board,
first
of
all,
has
not
said
at
any
time
in
its
rulemaking
proceeding
that
the
extraordinary
circumstances
exception
is
designed
to
allow
case-by-case
determination
of
bargaining
units.
it
basically
said
that
it
was
an
escape
valve--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--but
those
extraordinary
circumstances
that
could
exist
exclude
all
of
the
factors,
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
are
most
relevant
in
every
other
industry.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
what
the
rule
says.
that's
what
the
board
has
explained
the
rule
as
saying
in
its
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
it's
hard
to
believe,
under
the
circumstances
that
the
board
has
said,
that
it
could
possibly
mean
anything
more
than
that.
the
extraordinary
circumstances
exception
says
that
every
kind
of
issue,
every
kind
of
factor
that
we
have
seen
in
the
past
13
years
of
adjudicating
hospital
cases
and
all
of
these
other
factors
that
we
have
seen
in
other
cases
cannot
be
considered
extraordinary
circumstances.
things
like
the
size
of
the
institution,
the
services
provided,
functional
integration
of
employees,
which
is
a
critical
factor
in
every
other
industry,
contact
among
employees,
different
kinds
of
concepts
that
are
important
in
the
hospital
industry,
multi-competent
workers,
people
who
are
cross-trained,
team
care,
none
of
these
things
can
be
considered--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--well,
what
has
happened,
what
has
happened
in
this
rulemaking
is
two
things.
first
of
all,
it
said
that
we
don't
think
these
differences
exist
in
significant
extent
in
this
industry.
i
think
that's
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
we
have
made
that
argument.
secondly
though,
it
says
that
to
the
extent
it
does
exist,
and
they
acknowledge
these
variations
do
exist
to
a
certain
extent,
we
will
disregard
them
because
we
think
the
value
of
a
uniform
rule
exceeds
the
value
of
going
through
this
case-by-case
consideration.
well,
i
think
that's
a
determination
that
congress
said
the
board
can't
engage
in.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes.
thank
you.
it's
interesting
that
the
board
refers
here
to
the
first
st.
francis
case,
and
says
that
it
is
basically
trying
to
reestablish
the
first
st.
francis
approach.
in
that
first
st.
francis
case
the
board
held
that
the
in
each
case
language
of
section
9(b)
precludes
the
kind
of
presumption
that
it
had
in
the
past
that
a
nurses
unit,
an
r.n.
unit,
would
be
appropriate
in
each
and
every
case.
what
this
rule
does
is
it
says
if
a
union
comes
and
asks
for
any
one
of
these
eight
units,
that
unit
is
appropriate.
period.
the
employer
cannot
offer
facts
and
circumstances
of
a
particular
employer,
or
a
particular
workplace,
or
a
grouping
of
employees
to
rebut
that
presumption.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
board
will
accept
the
union's
choice.
yes.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
only
time
when
the
board
will
not
accept
the
union's
choice
is
if
it's
inconsistent
with
these
eight
units.
frankly,
i
think
that's
as
wrong--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--the
second
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking,
and
the
second
rule
said
that
we
will
assume
that
these
are
always
appropriate.
now
it
says
in
the
final
rule
that
no,
we're
going
to
look
at
it
because
we
don't
want
to
have
inappropriate
groupings
together,
such
as
perhaps
a
physicians
and
guards
unit.
but
ordinarily
the
board
will
consider
those
to
be
appropriate.
but
it
will
look--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--right.
combined
units
will
be
regarded
as
ordinarily
appropriate,
but
not
always
appropriate,
when
requested
by
the
union.
they
will
never
be
regarded
as
appropriate
when
the
employer
makes
that
kind
of
request.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that
one
issue,
where
they
decide
to
combine
units,
yes.
but
when,
let's
say,
there's
a
petition
for
a
unit
of
registered
nurses
and
the
employer
goes
up,
as
it
can
in
every
other
industry
and
as
it
has
always
done
in
this
industry,
and
says
this
unit
is
inappropriate
because
of
the
way
we
staff,
or
where
they
say
we're
going
to
have
a
service
and
technical
unit
that
is
separate,
as
it
said
for
example
in
the
vicksburg
hospital
case,
the
jewish
hospital
association
case,
and
all
three
cases
mentioned
in
the
admonition,
we're
going
to
say
that
these
units
are
not
appropriate.
the
board
is
going
to
say
we
will
not
listen
to
that
argument.
we
will
not
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
employer
if
the
union
is
asking
for
one
of
the
eight
units
that's
in
the
rule.
the
argument
here
from
the
board
is
basically
that
the
9(b)
language
adds
nothing
to
the
statute.
section
9(c)
requires
a
hearing
in
each
case.
all
the
factors
that
the
board
is
still
going
to
consider,
the
issues
that
they
are
going
to
consider,
don't
go
really
to
which
units
are
appropriate,
but
go
to
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
appropriate
under
section
9(c)
and
that
have
to
be
decided.
9(b),
where
it
says
the
board
shall
determine
the
appropriate
unit
in
each
case,
will
be
completely
ignored.
i
think
it's
useful
to
look
at
page
186
and
187
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the
board
describes
the
extraordinary
circumstances
exception,
and
where
it
sets
out
all
of
the
things
it
will
no
longer
consider,
and
i
think
to
compare
that
with
other
cases.
thank
you,
your
honor.
