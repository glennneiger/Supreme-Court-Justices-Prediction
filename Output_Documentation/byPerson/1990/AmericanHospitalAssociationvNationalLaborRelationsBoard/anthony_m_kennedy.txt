justice
kennedy
is
your
argument
helped,
counsel,
by
the
provision
in
the
statute
that
a
majority
of
professional
employees
can
vote
to
be
included
in
another
unit?
justice
kennedy
so
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
helps
you
in
that
respect?
justice
kennedy
i...
as
i
recall,
the
regulations,
though,
did
acknowledge
that
there
could
be
this
cross-over
if
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
the
unit,
in
each
unit
accept
the
cross-over.
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
kennedy
in
labor
cases
generally
other
than
in
the
health
care
area,
if
employees
agree
upon
a
unit,
is
that
generally
accepted
by
the
board?
justice
kennedy
suppose
all
of
the
employees
make
a
submission
as
to
what
they
want
the
unit
to
be.
does
the
board
accept
that,
or
does
it...
it
just
doesn't
work
that
way,
is
that
what
you're
telling--
justice
kennedy
your
comment
that
this
is
a
ceiling
on
the
number
of
groups,
because
there
can
be
fewer
groups
if
the
employees
so
elect,
that
excludes
any
participation
by
the
employer
in
that
determination,
and
that,
i
take
it,
and
i
take
it
also
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
board's
rule
in
all
other
areas,
where
the
employer
has
a
voice.
