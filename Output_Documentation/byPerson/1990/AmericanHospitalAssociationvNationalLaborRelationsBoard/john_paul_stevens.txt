justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
to
what
extent...
this
is
to
show
my
ignorance
about
this
area,
but
to
what
extent
is
there
room
under
the
regulation
for
there
to
be
debate
and
divergence
over
whether
a
particular
employee
is,
for
example,
a
professional
or
a
technical
employee?
justice
stevens
that
has
to
be
resolved
in
each
case,
does
it?
justice
stevens
wouldn't
it
be
pretty
unlikely
that
they
would
both
have
a
majority--
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
requires
us
to
review
the
first
exercise
of
substantive
rule
making
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
board
promulgated
a
rule
providing
that
with
limited
exceptions
including
an
exception
for
cases
presenting
extraordinary
circumstances,
eight
and
only
eight
bargaining
units
are
appropriate
for
collective
bargaining
in
acute
care
hospitals.
petitioner,
american
hospital
association,
brought
this
challenge
to
the
facial
validity
of
the
rule.
petitioner
raised
three
arguments;
first,
that
section
9(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
requires
the
board
to
make
a
separate
bargaining
unit
determination
in
each
case,
those
are
words
from
the
statute,
and
therefore,
prohibits
the
board
from
using
general
rules
to
define
units.
second,
that,
the
rule
violates
a
congressional
admonition
to
the
board
to
give
due
consideration
to
preventing
proliferation
of
bargaining
units
in
the
healthcare
industry.
and
finally,
that
the
rule
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
second
argument
and
enjoined
the
rule.
the
seventh
circuit
found
no
merit
to
any
of
the
arguments
and
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
the
board's
rule
making
powers
are
not
limited
by
section
9(b)'s
requirement
that
the
board
decide
the
bargaining
unit
in
each
case.
the
phrase,
in
each
case,
simply
indicates
that
whenever
there
is
a
disagreement
between
employers
and
employees
about
the
appropriateness
of
a
bargaining
unit,
the
board
shall
resolve
the
dispute.
even
when
an
agency
is
required
to
exercise
individualized
discretion
in
each
case,
the
agency
has
authority
to
formulate
rules
of
general
applicability
to
guide
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
unless
congress
clearly
indicates
an
intent
to
withhold
this
authority.
the
rule
is
not
invalid
because
of
the
congressional
admonition
that
the
board
should
give
due
consideration
to
avoiding
proliferation
of
bargaining
unit.
even
if
the
courts
should
properly
enforce
an
admonition
in
legislative
history
tied
to
no
specific
language
and
a
statute,
the
board
in
any
event
complied
with
the
admonition.
an
admonition
of
this
sort
is
best
understood
as
a
warning
by
congress
that
it
will
take
legislative
action
if
the
board
does
not
heed
congressional
wishes.
finally,
the
rule
is
not
arbitrary
and
capricious,
but
is
based
on
a
reasoned
analysis
of
an
extensive
rule
making
record
and
on
the
board's
years
of
experience
in
the
adjudication
of
healthcare
cases.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
