justice
scalia
counsel,
suppose
the
board...
is
this,
what,
is
this
the
second
rule
that
the
nlrb
has
ever
adopted?
it's
not
much
more
than
the
second,
anyway.
justice
scalia
the
first
substantive
one.
i
think
they
have--
justice
scalia
--now,
but
there's
a
lot
of
law
that
the
nlrb
has
made.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
all
sorts
of
rules
about
what
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
so
forth.
justice
scalia
now,
i
assume
they
have
been
adopted
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
adjudication.
justice
scalia
and
you
have
no
problem
with
that?
justice
scalia
so
the
nlrb
could
say
in
its
next
adjudication
it
seems
to
us
these
eight
units
are
appropriate
bargaining
units
with
respect
to
hospitals,
and
if
it
said
that
in
adjudication
it
would
be
all
right.
is
that
all
you're
arguing?
justice
scalia
well,
not
exactly
the
same.
you
might
say
it's
arbitrary,
you'd
make
the
same
arbitrary
and
capricious
argument
that
you
make
here,
but
you
couldn't
say
that
they're
ignoring
the
case
by
case--
justice
scalia
--but
why
is
that
an
inappropriate
rule,
although
it
is
appropriate
to
say
what
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice,
to
say
that
every
time
you
do
this,
every
time
you
do
it
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
your
brief
said
that
the
board
used
to
approve
only
four
units
because
of
a
test
it
used
to
apply,
the
disparity
of
interest
test
or
something
of
that
sort.
justice
scalia
but
applying
a
general
rule
to
all
of
them.
justice
scalia
the
disparity
of
interest
test,
or
whatever
other
test
it--
justice
scalia
--and
even
though
it
knows
that
the
outcome
of
that
test
will
always
be
that
there
are
eight
appropriate
bargaining
units,
it
must
not
say
that?
justice
scalia
but
suppose
the
agency
does
believe
that
applying
that
test
faithfully
will
always
lead
to
these
eight.
i
mean,
it
has
studied
all
the
types
of
employees
at
hospitals
and
it's
confident
that
these
eight
are...
that'll
be
the
situation
in
every
case?
justice
scalia
it
can
do
that
in
adjudication,
but
not
in
rulemaking?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
that
enough
to
establish
that
they
are
considering
it
case
by
case?
given
two
different
hospitals,
one
hospital
the
employees
want
to
organize
in
a
particular
fashion
that
has
less
than...
less
than
all
eight
of
these
separate
bargaining
units,
and
the
other...
in
the
other,
with
respect
to
the
other
employer
they
don't
want
to.
they
want
to
have
only
four
or
five.
justice
scalia
that's
all
you
need.
justice
scalia
aren't
those
two
cases
treated
differently?
justice
scalia
aren't
those
two
cases
treated
differently?
you
don't
impose
eight
separate
unions
on
each
of
those
two
employers.
you
wait
to
see
what
the
unions
want,
or
what
the
employees
want.
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
--mr.
holzhauer,
is
it
correct,
as
is
charged
in
respondents'
brief,
that
the,
your
client,
the
american
hospital
association
once
upon
a
time
took
just
the
opposite
position,
that
the...
it
was
necessary
for
the
nlrb
to
develop
a,
quote,
"uniform
national
approach
to
appropriate
units
in
the
health
care
industry?
"
justice
scalia
no,
this
was
before
the
rulemaking,
i
think.
this
was
much
earlier
when
the
board
was
still
proceeding
case
by
case.
you
were
knocking
down
these
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
because
you
were
saying
it's
necessary
to
have
a
uniform
national
approach.
so
they
now
go
through
a
rulemaking
and
adopt
a
uniform
national
approach,
and
you
change
the
tune.
justice
scalia
has
any
other
industry
litigated
as
assiduously
as
yours?
justice
scalia
maybe
it
thinks
these
factors
never...
that's
why
it
had
the
rulemaking.
maybe
it
found
that
these
factors
never
exist,
that
there
isn't
any
functional
integration
between...
between
nurses
and
doctors,
or
between
nurses
and
guards,
or
between
nurses
and
maintenance
workers.
maybe
it
has
found
that
as
a
result
of
its
rulemaking.
it
hasn't
conducted
rulemakings
for
other
industries.
justice
scalia
a
lot
of
courts
and
commentators
have
criticized
the
labor
board
in
the
past,
haven't
they--
justice
scalia
--for
not
conducting
rulemaking?
justice
scalia
13
years
of
litigation,
though.
justice
scalia
why
wouldn't
it?
i
thought
the
rule
was
that
if
any
of
these
sub-units
is
sought,
it
is
granted.
