justice
white
you're
really
saying
that
the
rule
ends
up
in...
the
board
just-refuses
to
decide
what
an
appropriate
unit
is?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
suppose
the
board
would
say
well,
if
we...
if
we
really
didn't
care
about
administrative
efficiency
or
saving
time
or
a
lot
of
things
like
that
we
would
decide
this
particular
case
differently,
but
we
value
whatever
it
is
we're
valuing
so
much
that
we
will
disregard
that
otherwise
we
would
find
this
unit
to
be
inappropriate.
justice
white
regardless
of
what...
of
what
they
would
decide
if
they
weren't
so
much
interested
in
uniformity.
justice
white
why
are
they
interested
in
uniformity?
justice
white
just
administrative
efficiency?
justice
white
now
you
just
want
them
to
lose
another
one,
i
guess.
justice
white
yeah,
but
not
because
they're
not
really
inappropriate.
it's
because
they
want
to
save
some
time.
justice
white
would
you
be
here,
would
you
be
here
if
the
rule
had
said
that
we're
going
to
treat
every
hospital
the
same,
namely
we're
going
to
have
only
one
unit
in
every
hospital?
justice
white
but
you
would
say...
but
you
would
be
supporting
the
rule.
justice
white
xxx
possibly
do
it.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
if
the
board
had
just
made
it
a
rebuttable
presumption,
how
often
do
you
think
you
would
ever
win
a
case?
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
would
have
to
convince
the
board
that
the
facts
or
circumstances
really
showed
it
though.
justice
white
more
often
than
you
would
by
showing...
what
do
they
call
it
under
this
rule...
exceptional
circumstances?
justice
white
how
do
you
know
it
is?
justice
white
what,
it's
empty?
we've
got
it
in
there,
but
it
means
nothing.
justice
white
well,
it
says
in
any
case,
and
in
any
case
there
may
be
extraordinary
exceptions.
justice
white
is
that
what
the
rule
says?
justice
white
even
though
it's
the
first
time
in
history
they
have
ever
tried
to
do
it?
justice
white
they
did
pretty
well
on
the
first
try,
is
that
it?
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
that's
just,
that's
what
exactly
the
employer
wants
to
do
in
this
case,
is
to
show
that
it's
inappropriate.
justice
white
and
the
board
won't
let
him.
justice
white
did
the
employers
participate...
did
the
association
participate
in
this
rulemaking
and
oppose
this
rule?
justice
white
and
they
had
their
full
say
in
the
hearing?
justice
white
too
much?
[laughter]
justice
white
what
were
the
circumstances,
or
what
was
the
reason
that
the
board
undertook
this
rulemaking
and
arrived
at
this
result,
rather
than
doing
what
it
did
for
13
years?
justice
white
you
don't
think
they
had
any
reason
just
to
administrative
efficiency
or
just
some
abstract
value
of
uniformity--
justice
white
--without
which
they
might
have
found
some
of
these
units
to
be
inappropriate?
justice
white
there's
a
tradeoff,
and
what's
traded
off
against
what?
justice
white
well,
in
that
kind
of
a
case
is
the
board
really
acting
consistent
with
the
direction
to
decide
in
that
particular
case
what
unit
is
appropriate?
justice
white
but
you
just
said
that
except
for
this
general
rule
that
they
have
now
made,
that
they
would
decide
the
case
differently.
if
they
really
got
down
to
brass
tacks
and
decided,
and
looked
at
the
case,
they...
you
just
said
they
would...
might
decide
it
differently.
justice
white
one
of
them
is
that
the
hospitals
are
different.
justice
white
--that
was
a
rule
established
by
adjudication.
justice
white
but
it
was
a
very...
with
a
result
very
similar
to
this
rule
that
has
been
adopted.
justice
white
are
you
suggesting
that
over
all
these
years
of
litigation
about
hospitals,
that
their
case-by-case
adjudication
sort
of
pointed
towards
eight
units?
justice
white
mr.
shapiro,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it's
very
likely
that
an
awful
lot
of
hospitals
will,
as
a
matter
of
fact
will
not
have
the
eight
bargaining
units?
justice
white
how
many...
what
percentage?
justice
white
so
this...
you're
saying
this
is
just
a
ceiling?
justice
white
just
a
ceiling,
and...
so
in
each
case
it's
going
to
have
to
be
decided
which
of
the
eight
units
are
going
to
be--
justice
white
--depending
on
what?
justice
white
so
it...
and,
i
take
it
that
the
board
just
isn't
automatically
going
to
agree
with...
every
time
with
what
is
sought?
justice
white
will
they
listen
to
that?
justice
white
wouldn't
it
be
the
case
that
sometimes
there
will
be
more
than
one
union
involved
in
the
case?
justice
white
well,
at
least
in
each
case
they're
going
to
have
to
decide,
aren't
they?
justice
white
but
the
board
would
take
a
union's
suggestion
that,
that
all
technical
employees,
all
skilled
maintenance
employees,
and
all
business
office
clerical
employees
should
be
included
in
one
unit?
justice
white
um.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
it
would
not
what?
justice
white
so
that
in
each
case
there
might
be
different
units
than
what
is,
are
specified
in
the
eight,
in
the
list
of
eight?
justice
white
what
if
they...
what
if
the
union...
what
about
the
question
i
just
asked
mr.
shapiro?
the
union
comes
in
and
says
we
want
a
unit
made
up
of
numbers
4,
5,
and
6?
justice
white
even
though
they
group
these,
what
would
otherwise
be
separate
units?
justice
white
so
at
least
to
this
extent
it
has
to
be
case-by-case
adjudication?
