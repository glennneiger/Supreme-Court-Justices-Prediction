justice
o'connor
mr.
holzhauer,
we
have
to
determine
what
the
meaning
of
the
"in
each
case"
language
is
in
this
context,
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
this
court,
for
example,
has
an
obligation
to
consider
each
case
on
its
plenary
docket,
and
yet
we
search
for
rules
of
general
applicability
to
be
applied
to
these
cases.
justice
o'connor
now,
isn't
the
board
doing
essentially
a
similar
thing
in
searching
for
some
kind
of
rule
of
general
applicability
for
most
cases,
leaving,
of
course,
its
extraordinary
circumstances
out
if
necessary?
justice
o'connor
mr.
shapiro,
would
you
say
the
rule
would
be
valid
even
if
there
were
no
extraordinary
circumstances--
justice
o'connor
--exception?
