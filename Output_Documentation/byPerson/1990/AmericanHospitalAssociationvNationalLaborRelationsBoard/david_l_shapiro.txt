mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
13
years
of
extensive
controversy,
uncertainty,
delay,
and
expense,
the
labor
board
decided
to
initiate
a
rulemaking
proceeding
on
the
vexing
question
of
unit
determinations
in
the
health
care
industry.
after
some
2
years,
which
included
two
very
extensive
notices
of
proposed
rulemaking,
a
number
of
significant
modifications
in
the
proposed
rule,
consideration
of
some
3,500
pages
of
testimony
from
over
140
witnesses,
and
1,800
written
submissions,
the
board
formulated
its
final
rule,
specifying
the
types
of
bargaining
units
that
in
the
absence
of
extraordinary
circumstances
would
be
considered
appropriate
on
the
filing
of
a
proper
petition
for
most
acute
care
hospitals.
i
sure
doubt,
parenthetically,
as
mr.
holzhauer
has
mentioned,
that
the
rule
specifically
contemplates
the
possibility
of
a
union
petition
for
a
combination
of
units,
and
in
that
sense
the
regulation
is
significant
in
imposing
a
ceiling
rather
than
a
floor.
this
regulation
is
fully
consistent
with
the
board's
authority
under
the
labor...
under
the
labor
laws,
it
is
firmly
rooted
in
an
exhaustive
investigation
and
analysis
of
the
record--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
believe
that
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
i
believe
that
it
would.
i
think
the
board
was
very
wise
in
including
an
extraordinary
circumstances
exception
in
the
record...
in
the
rule,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
in
the
act
or
the
legislative
history
of
the
1974
act
requires
such
an
exception,
or
indeed
analogous
precedents
of
this
court
in
other
areas.
the
rule
is
in
fact,
we
submit,
a
model
of
how
the
administrative
process
should
work.
now
it
has
been
challenged
by
the
petitioner--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--it's
unfortunate
that
it
has
taken
so
long,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
they
did
magnificently,
because
they
knew
how
important
this
process
was.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
indeed.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
indeed,
and
i
think
the
board
has
been
responsive
to
those
criticisms
in
an
area
where
there
was
a
singular
need
for
that
kind
of
response.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
it...
that
was
a
factor,
no
question
about
it.
[laughter]
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
the
employer...
i
think
it's
important
to
establish
at
the
outset
that
the
employer's
role
in
the
petitioning
process
is
a
very
limited
one.
it
is
the
union
as
the
representative
of
the
employees
that
chooses
the
bargaining
unit
to
be
sought
through
petition.
the
only
time
that
an
employer
is
authorized
to
petition
under
the
act
is
when
confronted
with
a
union
demand
for
recognition.
and
if
the
employer
files
a
petition,
my
understanding
is
that
by
withdrawing
the
demand
the
union
can
effectively
boot
that
petition.
the
petition
route
is
a
route
that
allows
the
union,
as
the
representative
of
the
employees,
to
seem
an
appropriate
unit.
now,
when
a
petition
is
filed
it
is
not
open
to
the
employer
to
argue
that
another
unit
is
also
appropriate
or
even
much
more
appropriate.
the
employer's
burden
would
be
to
show
that
this
unit
is
not
appropriate.
and
of
course
the
whole
purpose
of
this
regulation
was
to
establish
rules
under
which
we
acknowledge
indeed
we
are
very--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
the
employer--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--you
mean
in
this
rulemaking
proceeding?
they
want
to
attack
the
rule
as
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
they,
they
claim
that
this
rule
cannot
properly
establish
appropriate
units
in
the
industry.
in
a
particular
proceeding,
of
course,
the
operation
of
the
rule
would
effectively
preclude
the
employer
from
trying
to
show
that
a
given
unit
within
the
rule
is
not
appropriate
unless
in
the
very
limited
case,
and
we
acknowledge
it
is
very
limited,
extraordinary
circumstances--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes
they
did,
your
honor.
there
was
suggestion
from
the
industry--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--oh,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
at
least
enough.
[laughter]
the
rule
is
challenged
here
by
petitioner
on
three
grounds,
although
mr.
holzhauer
really
concentrated
only
on
one
of
them
in
his
oral
argument.
first,
that
the
rule
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
section
9(b)
and
particularly
the
"in
each
case"
language.
second,
that
the
rule
is
inconsistent
with
an
admonition
that
appears
in
certain
committee
reports
accompanying
the
1974
amendment
to
the
act
which
removed
the
exemption
for
nonprofit
hospitals.
and
finally,
that
the
rule
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
court
of
appeals,
we
submit,
properly
rejected
each
of
those
three
grounds.
it
properly
rejected
the
reliance
on
section
9(b)
because
the
"in
each
case"
requirement
does
not
preclude
the
board
from
formulating
rules
of
decision
that
govern
in
each
case,
that
effectively
supply
rules
of
relevance,
and
that
help
to
assure
that
like
cases
will
be
treated
alike.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
we
think
the
obligation
of
the
"in
each
case"
requirement
is
an
obligation
to
apply
whatever
standards
and
rules
may
exist
in
the
context
of
a
particular
proceeding
to
determine
the
appropriate
unit.
if
you
go
back
to
the
history
of
the
1935
legislation,
the
"in
each
case"
language
was
one
of
a
number
of
amendments
proposed
by
secretary
of
labor
bergens
as
she
described
it
for
the
sake
of
clarity.
that
clarification
may
not
have
been
essential,
but
it
was
helpful
because
the
very
specific
petition
requirement
of
section
9(c),
which
the
board
later
developed
and
which
now
appears
in
section
9(c),
was
not
a
part
of
the
original
act.
the
original
section
9(c)
was
a
good
deal
vaguer
about
how
the
process
worked,
and
in
that
context
we
believe
the
"in
each
case"
provision
was
a
useful
one.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
clarifying
language
should
be
given
the
radical
and
very
destructive
definition
that
petitioner
would
give
it
here.
it
does
not
preclude
the
board
from
formulating
rules
of
decision
that
facilitate
a
determination
that
in
a
particular
case
there
is
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact.
it
does
not
require
the
board
to...
to
reinvent
the
wheel
in
each
case.
now,
this
argument,
we
believe,
has
two
very
strong
supports.
one
is
that
very
similar
arguments
have
over
the
past
35
years
been
rejected
by
this
court
in
a
series
of
decisions
beginning
with
storer
broadcasting
back
in
the
1950's.
the
argument
has
been
repeatedly
made
that
particular
regulations
cannot
survive
challenge,
not
because
they
clash
with
some
substantive
provision
of
law,
but
because
they
are
at
odds
with
the
statutory
requirement
of
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
or
a
statutory
requirement
of
a
individualized
determination.
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
those
challenges
on
the
grounds
they
do
not
undermine
the
fundamental
administrative
authority
to
formulate
rules
of
decision.
it
did
so
in
the
storer
case
in
the
1950's,
in
the
texaco
case
in
the
1960's--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--in
a
way
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
there
was
stronger
language,
because
in
the
communications
act
the
statute
said
that
if
the
agency
cannot
decide
that
a
particular
application,
a
particular
license,
would
be
in
the
public
interest,
then
it
was
required
to
set
the
case
for
hearing.
now
what
the
communications
decision...
commission
did
was
to
say
that
if
a
station
owner
already
owned
five
stations,
he
could
not
get
a
sixth.
that
was
a
flat
rule.
there
was
a
waiver
procedure
provided,
but
the
rule
in
a
sense
facilitated,
permitted
summary
judgment.
if
a
station
owner
already
had
five
stations,
there
was
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
that
required
a
hearing.
this
language,
"in
each
case",
says
nothing
about
a
requirement
of
a
hearing,
and
does
not
address
the
sources
of
law
to
be
applied
in
each
case.
now
the,
the
precedent
of
the
storer
case
has
been
repeatedly
applied
by
this
court,
in
texaco
in
the
1960's,
more
recently
in
wncn,
in
heckler
and
campbell,
and
just
last
month
in
the
mobile
case.
so
not
only
is
there
a
long
line
of
precedent
in
this
court,
there
is
also,
we
believe,
a
consistent
view
of
the
labor
board
that
squares
with
its
position
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
i
think
there
were
a
number
of
reasons,
your
honor.
i
think
one
was
that
the
board
had
had
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
both
understanding
the
industry,
acquiring
enough
information,
and
in
persuading
the
courts
of
appeals
that
it
was
acting
consistently
with
its
legal
obligations.
the
courts
of
appeals
were
widely
divided
on
what
those
obligations
were,
very
widely
divided,
but
they
all
did
seem
to
agree
on
one
thing,
and
that
is
that
the
board
had
to
address
the
problem
as
a
distinctive
problem
in
a
distinctive
way.
and
i
think
the
board
was
both
responding
to
that
and
to
its
very
acute
need
for
more
information
by
undertaking
this
proceeding.
i
also
believe
that
part
of
what
the
board
was
doing
was
an
echo
of
what
it
tried
to
do
in
the
first
st.
francis
case,
that
is
the
board
was
mindful
of
the
admonition
in
the
1974
committee
reports
that
there
should
not
be
too
many
bargaining
units,
and
one
thing
it
tried
to
do
in
its
first
st.
francis
case
was
to
set
a
ceiling
on
the
number
of
bargaining
units
that
would
be
authorized
in
the
industry
to
prevent
the
kind
of
balkanization
that
had
occurred
in
the
construction
industry,
which
is
an
industry
that
had
a
very
large
number
of
different
skills
and
crafts,
very
much
like
a
hospital
industry.
and
so
one
of
the
objectives
of
this
rule,
we
believe,
and
a
very
significant
one,
was
to
establish
a
cap
on
the
number
of
units
which
would
apply
in
each
case.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
administrative--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
administrative
efficiency
was
a
factor.
i
think
it
has
been
vastly
overrated
in
the
argument
that
mr.
holzhauer
just
made.
i
think
that
what
was
motivating
the
board...
the
board
here,
and
what
it
made
very
clear
in
its
lengthy
opinions,
was
a
desire
to
determine
whether
despite
the
variations
among
hospitals
they
had
enough
in
common
so
that
as
a
matter
of
law
they
should
be
treated
alike.
that
their
goal
ultimately
was
to
focus
on
the
issue
whether
a
certain
class
of
acute
care
hospitals
had
enough
in
common
to
warrant
this
kind
of
treatment.
they
recognize
that
no
two
hospitals
are
alike,
just
as
no
two
fingerprints
are
alike,
no
two
people
are
alike.
the
question
remains
whether
a
valid
legal
generalization
can
be
made
about
fingerprints,
people,
or
hospitals.
the
board
concluded
that
it
could.
now,
i
think
it's
probably
true,
your
honor,
that
as
a
result
of
the
rule
individual
cases
might
be
decided
differently.
indeed,
if
that
were
not
so
there
seems
to
be
little
point
in
having
the
rule.
and
the
board
has
made
a
conscious
and
we
believe
wise
decision
that
the
tradeoff
is
worth
it.
indeed,
there
is
some
indications
that
deciding
of
accordance
with
the
rule--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--what
is
traded
off
is
perhaps
certain
marginal
cases
where
a
particular
proceeding
might
be
decided
differently
in
the
sense
that
a
given
unit
was
inappropriate,
and
yet
it
doesn't
qualify
for
the
extraordinary
circumstances
exception
and
is
governed
by
the
rule.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
because
i...
i
believe
that
the
"in
each
case"
requirement
does
not
stand
in
the
way
of
the
board's
articulating
rules
that
are
to
be
applied
in
each
case.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
yes,
they
might
decide
it
differently
for
a
wide
variety
of
reasons.
one
might
turn
simply
on--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--hospitals
are
different.
the
question
is
are
they
so
different
that
the
board
is
precluded
from
this
kind
of
generalization
about
when
units
are
appropriate.
there
are
problems
involved
in
leaving
decision
to
the
discretion
of
the
adjudicator
every
time,
and
in
our
view
9(b)
does
not
require
that.
those
problems
include
the
possibility
that
the
result
may
turn
on
the
particular
three-member
panel
that
is
sitting...
out
of
the
five
members
of
the
board
in
that
case...
might
turn
on
the
particular
skills
of
the
adversaries.
one
of
the
great
virtues
of
the
administrative
rulemaking
process
is
to
allow
agencies
to
narrow
their
discretion,
not
just
to
avoid
costly
and
expensive
litigation,
although
of
course--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
this
kind
of
regulation
is
novel.
but
i
think--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--this
regulation
is
novel.
there
is
no
other
industry
that
has
a
comparable
regulation.
but
the
board
has
in
fact
in
the
past
formulated
rules
of
decision
that
are
not
simply
presumptions,
as
petitioner
would
suggest.
the
board
has
in
the
past
formulated
conclusive
presumptions
in
the
area
of
unit
determination.
for
example,
in
the
tenth
annual
report
which
petitioner
relies
on
where
the
board
said
that
under
9(b)
they
are
required
to
make
a
decision
on
the
facts
of
each
case,
the
board
articulated
a
number
of
rules
that
it
had
developed.
some
of
those
rules
were
conclusive
rules.
for
example,
this
was
before
taft-hartley,
the
board
had
a
conclusive
rule
that
supervisors
would
never
be
put
into
the
unit
with
the
people
they
supervise
unless
there
was
a
long
history
of
bargaining
in
that
very
unit.
the
board
had
a
conclusive
rule
that
confidential
employees
would
not
be
put
in
any
unit.
the
board
had
a
conclusive
rule
that
people
who
monitor
other
people
would
not
be
put
in
a
unit
with
the
people
they
monitor.
in
the
postal
industry,
after
the
enactment
of
the
postal
reform
act,
the
board
announced
what
was
essentially
a
conclusive
rule
that
a
petition
would
be
dismissed
unless
it
sought
to
represent
all
the
employees
in
a
region
or
section
unless
it
submitted
on
a
nationwide
basis.
these
were...
had
it
been
crafted--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
your
honor,
but
it
was
conclusive
in
character.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
the
board
in
a
wide
variety
of
areas
has
done
its
job
well
in
adjudication
in
establishing
a
range
of
rules
that
vary
from
mild
preferences
to
very
strong
presumptions.
for
example,
in
the
single
facility
area
the
board
has
said
that
units
will
be
restricted
to
a
single
facility
unless
a
very
strong
showing
that
more
than
one
facility
operates
on
an
integrated
basis
can
be
made,
to
rules
that
are
truly
conclusive.
we
submit
it
is
not
a
defect
of
this
rule
that
it
increases
certainty
and
predictability.
it's
a
virtue.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
address
the
admonition
in
the
1974
reports,
because
it
has
been
such
a
large
part
of
the
litigation
over
the
years,
and
because
petitioner
places
so
much
emphasis
on
that
in
its
brief.
the
board's
view,
as
articulated
in
its
decision
in
this
case,
is
that
the
admonition
in
those
committee
reports,
which
neither
accompanies
nor
explains
any
relevant
statutory
language,
it
does
not
have
any
binding
legal
effect.
the
admonition
is
a
request
to
the
committee,
to
the
board
by
the
relevant
committees.
we
submit
that
it
is
a
matter
essentially
between
the
board
and
the
committees
of
congress
that
wrote
those
admonitions.
now,
we
also
contend
that
even
if
the
admonitions
were
incorporated
in
the
statute
itself
that
the
board
has
fully
complied
with
their
letter
and
their
spirit.
the
admonition,
to
begin
with,
does
not,
despite
petitioner's
heroic
efforts,
does
not
speak
at
all
to
the
choice
between
rulemaking
and
adjudication.
and
indeed
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
the
admonition
is
concerned
with
the
choice
between
rulemaking
and
adjudication.
the
board...
the
admonition
asks
the
board
to
give
due
consideration
to
preventing
proliferation.
the
board
has
done
that
in
this
rule
in
two
very
significant
ways.
first
of
all,
it
has
paid
very
close
attention
to
the
problem
of
the
number
of
units.
it
has
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
record
and
its
experience
that
there
is
no
domino
effect
in
the
hospital
industry,
that
the
authorization
of
a
particular
unit,
and
most
of
the
units
that
have
been
authorized
look
like
the
units
that
are
specified
in
this
regulation,
that
the
authorization
of
a
particular
unit--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--by
and
large,
your
honor,
yes.
and
the
units
that
are
specified
are
the
units
that
in
general
have
been
traditionally
recognized.
now,
physicians
rarely
seek
units.
guards
rarely
seek
units.
but
the
history
shows,
most
of
the
time
by
consent
and
sometimes
by
litigation,
that
when
registered
nurses
seek
a
unit
a
registered
nurses'
unit
will
be
authorized.
in
fact
the
two
main
controversies
that
have
led
to
litigation
are
rather
limited
ones.
one
involves
registered
nurses
and
whether
they
should
be
combined
with
other
professionals,
and
the
other
involves
separate
maintenance
workers.
but
a
report
by
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service
shows
that
of
all
hospitals
that
have
bargaining
units
today,
55
percent
have
only
one
bargaining
unit,
80
percent
have
two
or
less,
and
90
percent
have
three
or
less.
and
the
board
was
conscious
of
that.
the
board
also,
as
i
have
suggested,
was
very
conscious
of
the
need
to
put
a
cap
on
the
number
of
units
to
prevent
the
kind
of
balkanization
that
occurred
in
the
construction
industry.
so
the
board
has
ruled
that
all
other
professionals
are
confined
to
one
unit,
that
all
technical
workers,
despite
the
very
substantial
difference
in
their
skills
and
their
functions,
are
combined
in
one
unit,
that
all
skilled
maintenance
workers,
despite
the
balkanization
od...
of
workers
in
other
industries,
are
confined
to
one
unit.
so
the
board
has
been
concerned
about
the
numbers
problem.
the
board
has
also
investigated
exhaustively
the
question
whether
the
evils
thought
to
come
with
proliferation
are
associated
with
these
bargaining
units,
and
the
board
has
determined
that
they
are
not.
the
statistics
indicate
that
the
strike
rate
in
the
hospital
industry
is
quite
low,
lower
than
in
other
industries,
and
indeed
there
is
empirical
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
size
of
units,
or...
i'm
sorry,
the
number
of
units
is
inversely
related
to
the
likelihood
of
a
strike.
beyond
that
there
is
evidence,
and
indeed
it
doesn't
take
a
lot
of
evidence
to
know
that
the
larger
the
bargaining
unit,
the
more
disruptive
a
strike
is
like
to
be,
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
sympathy
strike.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that
question
is
effectively
left
open
in
most
areas.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
there
are
many
questions
that
have
to
be
resolved
in
each
case.
some
questions
go
to
unit
determination
itself,
for
example
single
facility
or
multi-facility,
and
many
questions
go
to
closely
related
issues,
employee
placement,
for
example,
the
question
that
you
raise,
dual-capacity
employees,
a
wide
variety.
in
fact,
the,
in
our
brief,
i
think
it
was
at
note
14,
we
indicated
a
whole
raft
of
questions
that
remains
for
determination
in
each
case.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
oh,
i
can't
give
you
a
percentage,
except
that
i
don't
think
there
are
many
hospitals
out
there
that
have
been
operating
under
the
1974
act
that
have
any
where
approximating
those...
that
number
of
units.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
this
is
a...
for
all
practical
purposes--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--depending
on
what
is
sought.
now,
we
acknowledge--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--on
what
is
sought.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
i
think
the
board
has
indicated,
your
honor,
that
if
a...
let's
take
a
hypothetical.
if
a
union
seeks
a
unit
of
registered
nurses...
that's
one
of
the
most
controversial
areas...
and
the
employer
comes
back
and
says
i
want
an
opportunity
to
show
that
in
this
hospital
a
unit
of
registered
nurses
is
appropriate,
let's
say
because
we
operate
in
teams
here--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--not
if
that's
all
that
the
employer
says,
unless
there
is
some,
as
the
board
has
said,
very
extraordinary
circumstance.
the
board
has
in
fact
not
only
dealt
with
these
cases
over
many
years,
but
has
dealt
very
exhaustively
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding
with
that
kind
of
argument.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
if
they're,
if
they're
competing
unions
which
are
seeking
different
formulations,
i
must
say
one
important
question
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
of,
if
you
have
one
union
that
comes
into--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--cases
involving
rival
claims
where
one
union
wants
a
broader
unit
than
another
union,
my
reaction
to
that
is
that
would
be
a
case
that
the
board
would
necessarily
have
to
resolve.
the
regulation
may
be
helpful,
but
i
don't
quite
see
how
the
regulation
could
determine
it
if
one
union
were
seeking
a
unit
that
included
what
another
union
was
seeking.
but
it
is
true
that
in
the
main--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--that
may
be.
i'm
trying
to
work
this
through
because
i
just
hadn't
thought
of
it.
if
one
unit
of
a
union
seeks
a
unit
of
skilled
maintenance
workers,
and
another
unit
of
the
union
wants
a
combination,
i
guess
that's
right,
that
the
union
that
seeks
the
unit
of
skilled
maintenance
workers
would
prevail.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
it's
not
inconceivable,
particularly
if
the
skilled
maintenance
workers
are
a
very
small
number
of
the
larger
unit.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
but
in
cases,
of
course,
where
combined
units
are
sought,
the
board
would
determine
whether
that
was
appropriate
in
that
case.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
just--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--if
the
union
sought
that?
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that
would...
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
regulation.
the
board
might
not
necessarily
approve
it.
the
board
would
have
to
find
that
that
was
an
appropriate
unit.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
but
the
regulation
would
not
preclude
that
finding.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
preclude
that
finding,
because
the
regulation
allows
a
union
to
seek
a
combination.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
if
the
union
sought
it,
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
my
time
is
up.
