chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-97,
american
hospital
association
v.
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
holzhauer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
without
any
general
principles
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
can't...
it
can't
establish
a
rule
that
is
conclusive,
regardless
of
the
facts
of
a
particular
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
that
mean
simply
that
the
board
can't
have
a
conclusive
presumption
in
the
interest
of
administrative
efficiency?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
it
mean
anything
more
than
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if,
if
the
board
in
50
separate
cases
had
heard
employers'
evidence
to
this
effect,
and
in
every
single
case
it
had
said
well,
this
evidence
just
doesn't
change
our
minds,
it
couldn't
at
the
end
of
those
50
cases
adopt
some
general
principle?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
the
board
have
standards
of
relevancy
that
it
could
impose?
it
could
say
we're
not
going
to
hear
these
kinds
of
evidence
from
the
employer
because
in
these
other
50
cases
we
have
decided
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
holzhauer.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
the
mr.
shapiro?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
there
similar
language
in
the
communications
act
to
the
"in
each
case"
language
in
the
labor
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
has
been
done
only
in
the
area
of
hospitals
by
the
board,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
didn't
quite
get
your--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
holzhauer,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
will
the
board
inevitably
accept
the
union's
choice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
inevitably?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
holzhauer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-97
american
hospital
association
versus
national
labor
relations
board
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
