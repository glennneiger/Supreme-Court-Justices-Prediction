mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
federal
sentencing
guidelines
case.
mr.
burns
was
sentenced
to
60
months'
imprisonment,
although
the
judge,
the
presentence
investigator,
and
the
parties
all
agree
that
the
appropriate
guideline
range
for
the
case
is
30
to
37
months'
imprisonment.
neither
the
parties
or
the
presentence
investigator
identified
any
grounds
that
might
justify
departure
from
the
appropriate
guideline
range
as
that
terms
is
defined
by
statute.
it
was
not
until
sentence
was
imposed,
however,
that
the
judge
indicated
that
she
disagreed
with
that
assessment
and
in
fact
found
at
least
three
grounds
which
did
justify
departure.
she
at
that
point
immediately
imposed
sentence
of
60
months'
imprisonment
and
directed
the
defendant
to
step
back
with
the
marshal.
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court
today
is
whether
or
not
the
judge
was
obliged
to
alert
the
parties
that
she
had
found
three
grounds
for
departure
that
no
one
had
identified
so
as
to
allow
comment
on
whether
or
not
departure
was
appropriate
before
sentence
was
imposed.
we
make
this
argument
both
under
rule
32(a)(1)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and,
alternatively,
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
due
process.
rule
32(a)(1)
was
amended
at
the
same
time
that
congress
passed
the
sentence
reform
act
of
1984
to
provide
as
follows,
and
i
will
quote
for
this
purpose.
"at
the
sentencing
hearing
the
court
shall
afford
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
the
attorney
for
the
government
an
opportunity
to
comment
upon
the
probation
officer's
determination
and
on
other
matters
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence."
the
court
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
court
shall
also
afford
counsel
for
both
sides
and
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
address
the
court.
it
is
our
argument
that
under
the
circumstances
presented
here,
where
the
judge
is
the
only
person
who
has
identified
grounds
for
departure,
that
the
judge
must
alert
the
parties
to
that
fact,
otherwise
the
court
is
not
affording
the
parties
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
a
matter
that
is
very
much
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
o'connor,
the
reason
that
i
think
that
that
notice
is
not
adequate
is
because
the
guidelines
contemplate
that,
for
most
cases
i
would
submit,
that
the
sentence
should
be
within
the
guideline
range
and
that
it
requires
unusual
circumstances
before
the
judge
can
depart
from
the
range
which
have
to
be
identified
for
the
record
and
are
subject
to
appeal.
it
is
a
complex
enough
decision
that
without
some
guidance,
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
a
lawyer
to
pick
up
the
guideline
manual
and
identify
any
possible
grounds
for
departure.
thus,
the
presentence
investigator
in
preparing
the
presentence
report,
which
the
parties
are
entitled
to
see...
at
least
this
part
of
it...
is
directed
under
the
rule
to
identify
any
grounds
which
might
justify
departure
without
regard
to
whether
the
investigator
believes
they
ought
to
be
used.
thus,
i
would
submit
that
in
the
situation
where
that
investigator
says
there
are
no
grounds
for
departure...
that
might
justify
departure...
counsel
truly
is
not
on
notice.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
guideline
manual,
or
the
guideline
system,
contemplates
two
types
of
departure:
those
that
are
recognized
either
in
the
5
case
series,
aspects
of
the
crime,
those
that
involve
the
prior
criminal
history
under
the
4
series.
but
also
the
judge
also
has
the
ability
to
depart
for
reasons
that
the
judge
determines
were
not
considered
at
all
by
the
sentencing
commission.
therefore,
in
that
circumstance
the
defendant
or
the
defense
counsel
would
have
to
look
at
their
record
in
the
case
to
attempt
to
identify
is
there
anything
here
that
wasn't
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
we
acknowledge
that
the
underlying
facts
that
there
can
be
some
debate
as
to
whether
we
knew
that
there
was
a
substantial
impairment
of
governmental
function
when
none
was
identified
in
the
presentence
report.
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
factual
matter
that
we
wish
to
contest
that
the
fundamental
facts
are
incorrect.
however,
what
we
would
have
contested
had
we
had
the
opportunity...
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
conclusion
of
the
record...
would
have
been
whether
there
were
reasonable
grounds
for
departure
and
whether
it
was
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
and
even
assuming
that
there
were
grounds
for
departure,
whether
or
not
departure
to
the
extent
that
the
judge
in
fact
departed,
which
is
some
42
percent
over
the
guideline
range
maximum,
was
necessary
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
kennedy,
i
would
submit
that
in
this
circumstance,
i
would...
i
would...
it's
important
i
think
to
underscore
that
we
are
not
requesting
that
the
court
construe
the
guidelines
and
the
rules
as
requiring
a
judge
in
all
circumstances
to
announce
to
the
parties
that
the
court
is
considering
a
departure.
this
only
comes
up
in
the
situation
presented
here
where
no
one,
other
than
the
judge,
has
identified
grounds
for
departure,
and
in
fact,
the
presentence
investigator
has
indicated
that
there
are
none.
it
is
only
in
that
circumstance
that
we
submit
that
the
obligation
under
rule
32(a)
to
afford
the
parties
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
matters
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence
cannot
be
exercised
unless
the
court
indicates
in
one
fashion
or
another
that
the
court
disagrees
with
it...
other
people's
conclusions...
and
that
there
is
a
ground
for
departure.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct,
and
i
would
submit
that
not
only
did
anybody
think
of
it,
i
don't
think
he
would
have
had
the
right.
but
i
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
congress
attempted
to
change
with
guidelines
sentencing.
there
are
two
concepts
here.
one
was
to
restrict
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
because
of
what
congress
found
to
be
unconscionable
disparity
in
sentencing.
but
also
to
inject
a
large
measure
of
fairness
in
the
process
that
did
not
previously
exist.
under
rule
32(c),
the
defense
right
to
access
to
the
presentence
report
and
their
right
to
challenge
matters
in
that
report,
factual...
actually
the
right
of
both
sides
to
challenge
it...
has
no
parallel
in
previous
sentence
existence
in
the
federal
system.
and
our
point
is
that
under
this
guideline
system
it
was
changed
so
that
one
of
the
key
factors
is
that
the
parties
are
to
have
meaningful
participation.
i
guess
the
best
analogy
i
can
draw
is
that
if
the
presentence
investigator
had
identified
any
grounds
for
departure,
that
had
to
go
in
the
report.
if
it
did,
the
defense
would
have
been
on
notice.
they
could
have
challenged
the
factual
premises
for
it.
they
could
have
prepared
for
the
sentencing
hearing
and
presented
arguments
that...
such
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief
to
try
and
convince
the
judge
that
it
was
either
inappropriate
to
depart
or,
if
the
judge
was
going
to
report,
to
try
and
reduce
the
amount
the
judge
would
depart.
that
is
consistent
with
how
the
guidelines
are
supposed
to
operate.
informed
participation
by
the
parties
is
essential.
yes?
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
blackmun,
what
counsel
could
have
said
i
believe,
addressing
the
three
grounds
here...
we
have
three
grounds:
duration,
concealment,
and
significant
disruption
of
governmental
function.
duration
is
a
factor
that
was
not
considered
by
the
guideline
commission
at
all
as
a
grounds
for
departure,
so
it's
a
judge-directed
departure.
with
that,
i
think
counsel
could
have
argued
to
the
court
that
duration,
in
essence,
is
captured
in
the
guidelines
because
they
allow
the
relation
back
to
the
events...
so
in
this
case
it
was
over
6
years,
the
duration
of
the
crime
as
how
it
was
aggregated
to
over
$1.2
million.
and
that's
what
raised
the
level
of
the
crime,
i
believe,
to
level
19
and
that
this
really
wasn't
something
different
than
what
the
guidelines
had
already
factored
into
it.
with
regard
to
concealment,
which
relates
to
the
tax
evasion
to
cover
up
the
crime,
although
that
is
covered
by
5k29
of
the
departure
grounds,
it
was
also
a
basis
for
enhancing
the
level
of
the
tax
fraud
by
two
levels,
so
it
was
in
that
sense
already
considered
by
the
guideline
commission.
and
with
regard
to
significant
disruption
of
a
governmental
function,
counsel
could
have
and
should
have
argued
that
this
type
of
disruption
of
a
governmental
function
is
inappropriate
for
departure
or
is
not
required
since
almost
any
crime
that
involves
the
federal
government
will
disrupt
it
in
some
way
or
another.
and
this
should
not
be
considered
significant.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
marshall,
i
would
submit
that
what
the
judge
would
need
to
do
would
be
to
alert
the
parties
by
indicating
the
grounds
of
the
departure
in
advance
in
such
a
way
that
the
parties
could
comment
on
that.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
think
it
would
be
done
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
in
this
case
i
don't
think
it
would
require
much
more
than
i
am
considering
the
duration
of
the
crimes,
the
facts
that
they
were
concealed--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--in...
certainly
if
it's...
there
are
many
circumstances
where
you
wouldn't.
since
the
premise
is
rule
32(a)(1)
that
the
court
has
to
afford
an
opportunity
to
comment.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
because
in
this
case,
there
was
no
indication
to
alert
the
parties
to
the
type
of
argument
they
should--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--there
was
very
much
a
need
here.
as
i
indicated,
if
this
had
been
indicated
anywhere
in
the--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--the
need
is
so
that
counsel
can
prepare
the
arguments
that
are
necessary
to
the
decision
whether
or
not
there--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--yes,
it
would
have
to
be
in
particular.
the
specific
grounds
that
the
judge
was
relying
on,
and
that--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--there
is
not
a
word
in
the
guidelines
that
says
that,
except--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--there
certainly
would
not
have
been
a
guideline
range
before
either.
this
language
that
was
added
to
the
rule
was
superimposed
on
language
that
already
existed
in
the
rule
that
allowed
the
parties
the
right
to
address
the
court.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
there
was
a
statutory
range,
a
statutory
maximum.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
reason,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
is
before
the
guidelines
went
into
effect
no
statutory
rights
were
created
or
expectation.
it
is
precisely
because
of
the
situation
you
describe,
where
the
parties
had
no
rights
at
all
at
the
proceeding
to
know
anything,
that
these
guidelines
came
into
effect
because
congress
determined
that
sentencing
as
it
existed
in
the
federal
system,
pre-guidelines,
produced
unwarranted
disparity.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
scalia,
the
distinction
i
would
draw
there
is
i
think
that
the
guidelines
create
a
structure
whereby
the
parties
are
entitled
to
participate
in
this
process
to
try
and
persuade
the
judge
and
influence
the
decisional
process.
i'm
not
suggesting,
and
we
have
not
indeed
argued
on...
in
this
appeal...
that
the
judge's
decisions
were
unreasonable.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
there
are
alternatives
that
may
also
may
be
reasonable
and
in
fact
are
reasonable
that
should
have
been
presented
to
the
court
before
she
made
her
decision.
then
she
would
made
her
decision,
and
that
is
very
much
what
the
guidelines
were
attempting
to
create.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
appears
elsewhere
in
the
rule.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
rule
goes
on
to
say
the
court
shall
also
afford
counsel
the
opportunity
to
address
the
court
and--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--and
i
would
say
that
there's
an
independent
right
to
comment
on
matters
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence
beyond
the
other
part
of
the
rule.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
by
virtue
of
this
language
that
was
superimposed.
i
mean
the
language
is
rendered
redundant
or
possibly
even
superfluous
and
i...
again,
the
analogy
i
would
draw
to
is
if
the
presentence
investigator
identifies
grounds
for
departure,
counsel
is
guaranteed,
at
least
10
days
before
imposition
of
sentence,
opportunity
to
prepare
arguments
against
departure
or
if
the
other
side
raises
it,
he
would
get
the
same
right.
and
it
is
anomalous
to
suggest
that
in
the
situation
where
no
one
has
identified
it,
where
there
is
no
alerting
of
the
parties
to
the
possibility
that
departure
may
be
there,
that
the
court
should
not
afford
that
opportunity
but
should
back
silently,
listening
to
argument
that
really
has
nothing
to
do--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--no,
no.
it's
the
judge
alone
that
is
doing
it.
and
i
would
submit...
i
would
submit
what
you're
asking
for
is
informed
participation,
the
ability
to
comment
on
a
matter
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence.
here,
this
record,
i
think,
amply
demonstrates
that
counsel
really
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
departure.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
assuming
the
judge
also
indicated
the
basis
for
the
departure.
in
other
words,
if
the
judge
said,
i'm
considering
departing
because
of
the
duration
of
these
crimes,
then
i
think
courts
have
upheld
that
it's
been
adequate
unless
counsel
at
that
point
raises
an
objection
that
they
need
more
time
to
address
the
question
of
departure.
but
that
type
of
notice
can
be
consistent
with
what
rule
32(a)
requires.
and
in
fact,
this
is
the
rule
that
exists
in
some
six
circuits
at
this
point.
the
d.c.
circuit
is
the
only
circuit
that
has
held
otherwise.
and
i
think
the
premise
is
largely
that
one
of
the
major
changes
that
the
guidelines
bring
into
the
process
is
informed
participation
by
the
parties.
the
government
itself
has
on
two
occasions
filed
appeals
where
they
have
been
deprived
of
notice
of
a
downward
departure.
and
as
the
court
is
aware,
these
appeals
were
part
of
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
solicitor
general.
under
this
guideline
scheme,
the
ability
to
make
the
arguments
as
to
whether
or
not
departure
is
appropriate
is
essential
to
effective
representation
of
the
defendant
or
the
government
and
also
is
an
important
tool
in
assuring
that
you
don't
have
unwarranted
departures.
it
may
well
be
that
in
this
case
the
judge
would
have
departed
anyway
had
she
heard
from
counsel.
but
the
question
is
would
it
have
been
60
months,
might
it
have
been
58
months,
might
it
have
been
57
months?
it's
impossible
to
tell.
but
this
type
of
process
ensures
that
the
court
will
get
the
best
arguments
on
both
sides.
and
what
happens
here
that
does
not
occur.
counsel's
argument,
as
the
transcript
reveals,
had
nothing
to
do
with
departures.
it
was
a
generalized
discussion
which
judge
newman
in
the
united
states
v.
kim
cite...
said
in
our
brief
in
the
second
circuit
indicated
almost
invariably
as
what's
going
to
happen
if
you
don't
have
notice
of
the
possibility
of
departure.
you'll
simply
make
and
argument
identifying
the
mitigating
circumstances
and
that
will
be
it.
but
when
you
have
notice
that
the
judge
is
considering
various
factors,
it
requires
you
to
marshal
what
the
guideline
commission
considered,
what
it
didn't
consider,
and
make
the
best
possible
arguments
that
are
almost
the
equivalent
of
a
mixed
question
of
law.
in
fact,
it's
not
a
straight
factual
argument.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
almost
threefold,
3.5
percent--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--as
a
general
matter,
yes.
only
3.5
percent
of
the
some
12.5
percent
of
departures
in
1989
were
upward
departures.
and
the
government
very--
but
i
think
the
most
telling
thing
about
the
government
appealing
is
they
recognized
as
well
that
this
type
of
notice
is
essential
to
preparing
for
sentencing
proceeding.
and
it's
important...
there's
no
question
that
under
traditional
sentencing
the
types
of
rights
i'm
talking
about
would
not
even
be
discussed.
the
case
wouldn't
be
here.
the
guidelines
change
the
calculus.
it's
a
different
process.
it's
not
unfettered
discretion
of
the
district
court.
it's
totally
changed
from
that.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
white,
that's
true,
but
i
would
submit
the
reason
for
that
is
in
the
vast
majority--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--no,
but
again
the
important
thing
to
stress
there
is
we're
asking
for
notice
in
a
very
limited
circumstance
and
not
for
the
purposes
of
knowing
what
the
judge
is
thinking,
but--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--no,
i
would
submit
not.
i
think
the
language
in
rule
32(a)(1)
is
adequate
in
this
limited
circumstance
to
conclude
that
the
judge
cannot
afford
you
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
a
matter
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence
without
alerting
you
to
the
fact
that
the
court
is
considering
departure.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--the
[inaudible]
goes
beyond
that.
it
says,
shall
afford
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
and
the
government
the
opportunity
to
comment
upon
the
probation
officer's
determination
and
on
other
matters
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
a
change
that
came...
the
language
i
think
you
were
referring
to,
justice
scalia,
is
from
the
earlier
pre-guidelines.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
and
i
very
much
agree,
pre-guidelines,
it's
not
there.
but
this
language,
the
court
is
under
an
obligation
to
allow
you
to
address
matters
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence.
well,
we'll
arguing
as
a
matter
of
fact
almost
that
where
the
judge
is
the
only
one
that
knows
there
are
grounds
for
departure,
the
only
way
the
judge
can
afford
you
the
opportunity
to
address
those
matters
is
to
identify
them
for
counsel
before
sentence
is
imposed.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
it.
there
were
no
grounds
for
departure.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes,
but--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--you
could
certainly
argue
that,
justice
white,
but
to
be
able
to
structure
it
and
figure
out
duration,
which
isn't
even
mentioned
as
a
ground
for
departure
in
the
guidelines,
is
something
the
judge
identified.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
while,
our
point
is
that
the
guidelines
are
sufficiently
complex
that
without
notice
from
somewhere--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--if
in
fact--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--no
notice--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--that
would...
i
would
submit
in
that
situation,
as
the
second
circuit
concluded
in
jagmohan
where
the
government
appealed
to
lack
of
notice,
the
conclusion
there
was
that
it's
harmless
error.
you
would
have...
if
you
made
the
arguments
that
should
have
been
made,
you
can't
complain
that
you
didn't
get
notice.
we
did
not
make
the
arguments
that
should
have
been
made.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
your
honor,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
judge
does
have
to
tell
you
that.
that
if
all
the
judge
says
is
i'm
thinking
of
departing
without
stating
the
grounds
that
that
does
not
afford
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--that
is
correct.
that
the
judge
is
considering...
i
would
assume
in
most
situations
this
type
of
notice
would
be
given
before
the
sentencing
hearing
itself.
the
courts
that
have
addressed
it
have
suggested
that
certainly
is
the
better
procedure,
but
since
everybody
is
grounded
it
on
32(a)(1),
it's
a
case-by-case
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
you
were
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
comment.
but
everyone
contemplates
that
you
must
know
the
grounds.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
in
that
situation,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
a
new
ground
that
nobody
has
yet
to
address.
this
language
would
require
the
judge
before
sentence
was
imposed
to
identify
it
and
afford
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
a
matter
related
to
the
appropriate
sentence.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
be
true,
but
i
think
that
what
is
being
overstated
here
is
the
likelihood
that
a
judge
is
going
to
come
up
with
new
and
different
grounds
at
the
proceeding
itself.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
don't
think
that
you
will
have
the
continuances.
i
would
point
out
that,
that
this,
this
rule
is
in
effect
in
six
circuits
in
one
form
of
another,
some
for
over
a
year,
and
the
various
problems--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--i
don't
think
so,
because
i
don't
think
the
government
has
identified
any
specific
problems
that
have
come
from
this.
in
most
situations
there
will
not
be
postponements
of
proceedings.
the
decision
to
depart
has
to
be
formulated
too
carefully.
most
judges,
as
was
the
case,
i
think,
here,
have
to
think
about
it
before
they
come
to
the
proceeding.
it's
a
very
complex
decision
and
also
in
most
situations
it
will
be
identified
either
by
the
presentence
investigator
or
the
parties.
so
we're
talking
about
something
that
comes
up
very
rarely
and
i
would
submit
that
this
language
is
adequate
as
a
safety
valve
to
ensure
that
the
parties
have
some
say
in
it.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
our
position
on
that
is
that
the
creation
of
guideline
ranges
with
the
use
of
the
language
that
the
court
shall
sentence
within
the
guideline
range
unless
certain
factors
are
found
to
exist
is
sufficiently
mandatory
as
to
change
the
due
process
calculus
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
court
has
held
in
cases
involving
statutory
provisions
that
afford
greater
rights
than
existed.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct,
but
if
a
substantive
right
is
recognized
to
a
sentence
that
is
not
only
within
the
statutory
range
but
also
that
you
have
a
protectable
liberty
interest
in
the
guideline
range
itself,
then
it
would...
the
court
would
have
to
determine
under
mathews
v.
eldridge
as
to
whether
or
not
the
notice
requirement
materially
aids...
reduces
the
risk
of
error.
so
in
that
situation,
even
if
the
rule
did
not
provide
it,
the
court
could
conclude,
as
it
often
does
in
due
process
situations,
that
meaningful
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
comment
are
fundamental
protections
of
any
liberty
interest.
so--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--yes,
i
would
submit
that
the
guideline
range
by
using
the
mandatory
language
in
3553(b)
that
the
court
shall
sentence
within
the
guideline
range
is
a
substantial
departure
from
previously
existing
sentencing
law
in
the
federal
system
and
that
it
does
create
a
protectable
interest
and
that
in
the
circumstances
presented
here
the
defendant
should
have
the
right
to
address
that,
the
departure
from
it.
and
because
he
perceived
no
notice
here
and
did
not
address
it,
that
he's
entitled
to
resentencing.
if
there
are
not
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do.
for
the
government
implicit
in
their
argument
is
that
everybody
knew
departure
was
a
possibility
and,
therefore,
this
came
as
no
surprise.
the
government
entered
a
guilty
plea
in
which
it
agreed
that
the
sentencing
range
for
this
case
was
30
to
37
months,
and
at
page
6
of
the
joint
appendix,
what
they
didn't
agree
to
was
where
the
sentence
would
be
within
that
range.
they
received
a
presentence
report
that
said
there
was
no
basis
for
a
departure
from
the
guideline
range.
they
signed
off
it,
no
objection.
they
went
to
the
sentencing
proceeding,
argued
on
behalf
of
the
government,
did
not
ask
for
a
departure
from
the
guidelines,
did
not
state
any
grounds
for
departure.
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
this
was
not
obvious
to
anyone.
this
was
not
implicit
in
what
was
going
on.
the
parties
had
agreed
they
had
enough
evidence
to
sink
a
battleship,
so
it's
not
a
question
of
a
guilty
plea
because
of
thin
evidence.
that's
what
they
agreed
to.
that's
what
they
determined
the
case
was.
and
what
happened
here
is
certainly
not
what
congress
anticipated
was
going
to
happen.
the
first
point
for
that
argument
is
congress
thought
that
sentencing
as
it
existed
in
the
federal
system
before
the
guidelines
was
in
a
word,
lousy.
they
sought
to
change
it
radically.
they
did
change
it
radically.
and
part
of
what
they
changed
was
their
perception
of
what
was
fair.
justice
stevens,
i
think
your
point
is
very
important
that
congress
anticipated
that
in
most,
if
not
all
cases,
the
various
grounds
for
sentencing
would
appear
in
the
presentence
report
or,
if
not
there,
in
the
presentence
report
plus
the
parties
were
reacting
to
it.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
think
so
particularly
because
of
the
structure
in
which
congress...
i
mean,
congress
is
the
one
that
really
creates
the
liberty
interest,
not
the
sentencing
commission.
what
congress
said
was
that
sentences
should
be
within
that
range.
congress
is
the
one
that
has
created
the
liberty
interest,
not
the
guideline
commission.
it's
by
statute
that
we're
relying
on
18,
section
3553(b),
so
i
think
under
that
circumstance
it
is
consistent
with
mistretta.
