mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
district
judges
conducting
sentencing
hearings
must
be
required
to
comply
with
new
procedures
imposed
by
appellate
courts
developed
through
case-by-case
litigation
rather
than
through
the
traditional
amendment
process.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
that
would
depend
on
the
court's
rule
in
this
case.
our--
[laughter]
if
you
do
say
defendants
have
the
right,
we
would
certainly
in
a
subsequent
case
say
that
would
have
a
right.
as
the
first
matter
though
we
do
not...
it...
the
position
of
the
acting
solicitor
general
is
that
it...
no
notice
is
required.
the
two
cases
in
which
assistant
u.s.
attorneys
have
requested
that
in
briefs,
the
goff
case
and
the
jagmohan,
the...
excuse
me...
the
appeal
was
authorized
only
on
the
substantive
departure.
there
was
no
authorization
to
appeal
on
the
notice
issue
and
that's
about
all
i
can
say.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
not
at
all.
we're
a
big
department,
and
we
authorize
appeals.
we
don't
review
briefs
before
they're
filed,
and
in
this
case
this
may
have
been
an
instance
where
we
should
have
seen
the
brief
before
they
were
filed.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
no,
i
was...
to
the
extent...
oh
excuse
me--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--justice
souter,
if
i
understand
the
due
process
argument
it's
that
to
minimize
risk
of
error,
notice
is
required.
that,
i
think,
would
apply
evenhandedly
to
the
defendant
as
well
as
to
the
government,
because
there
could
be
erroneous
downward
departures
against
the
government
just
as
there
could
be
erroneous
upward
departures
against
the
defendant.
so
if
the
theory
is,
and
i
take
it
the
position
in
petitioner's
brief
which
we
vehemently
disagree
with,
but
to
the
extent
that
position
is
accepted,
it
would
apply
as
well
to
the
government
as
it
would
to
the
defendant.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
that's
an
interesting
point.
to
the
extent
that
the
sentencing
is
to
get
a
just
sentence
though
and
a
just
sentence
would
require
a
departure
in
that
case,
i
suppose
then
we
might
well
argue
that
it
requires
notice
to
both
parties.
but--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--yes,
indeed.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
it
is
indeed.
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
haven't
reviewed
those
briefs
myself.
it
seems
from
the
way
the
court
has
discussed
those
briefs
that
they
were
only
based
on
the
rule
and
as
well
it
seemed
they
were
both
basically
trying
to
evoke
circuit
precedent
that
had
been
developed
in
favor
of
defendants...
in
favor
of
the
government
in
that
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
which,
which
and
there's
also
a
decision
made
when
congress
adopted
the
appellate
review
provision
to
allow
government...
the
government
to
appeal
as
well
as
the
defendant.
so
the
rule
does
have...
the
rule
and
the
guidelines
themselves
reflect
an
evenhandedness
that
would
require
this
same
treatment
to
defendants
and
to
the
government.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
there
are
a
total...
all
the
figure
are
as
follows.
82
percent
of
cases
are
sentenced
within
the
guidelines.
12.2
of
the
remaining
18
percent
of
cases
are
sentenced
outside
the
guidelines.
there
are
about...
there
are
approximately
2.49
downward
departures
against
the
government
for
every
one
departure
upward.
the
balance
of
the
sentences
are
departures
on
motion
of
the
government
for
substantial
assistance
after
the
sentence
had
been
meted
out.
and
that
is...
all
in
the
1989
annual
report
of
the
sentencing
commission.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
certainly,
maybe
i
can
comment
on
that
just
briefly
now.
as
i
understand
it
in
rejecting
the
sort
of
bitter
with
the
sweet
notion,
at
least
a
majority
of
the
court
has,
there's
a
bifurcation
of
the
decision-making
process.
one
first
determines
whether
the
due
process
clause
applies,
then
the
court
determines
what
processes
do.
in
this
case,
i
would
think
the
defendant
has
a
constitutional
liberty
interest
in
his
sentence.
that's
why
this
court
in
cases
such
as
townsend
v.
burk
have
required
that
the
right
to
counsel
extends
to
the
sentencing
hearing
and
requires
that
the
court
base
its
sentence
on
materially
correct
information.
so
the
due
process
clause
has
always
applied
to
sentencing,
before
and
after
the
guidelines.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i
think
that's
right,
but
my
point,
justice
souter,
is
that
what's
new
goes
to
the
first
part
of
this
court's
due
process
jurisprudence,
whether
the
due
process
clause
applies.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
second
question,
which
is
what
processes
do.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
if...
if
the
guidelines
were
instead
to
be
applied
by
a
parole
commission,
for
example,
yes,
there
would
be
something
new,
and
under
the
greenholtz
decision,
the
parole
commission
may
well
have
some
minimum
hearing
requirements
as
the
court
determined
in
that
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
no,
not
by
the
court
because
sentencing
judges
have
always
had
to
comply
with
due
process.
their
proceedings
have
always
had
to
be
fundamentally
fair,
and
i
think--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
guess
my...
actually
my
initial
answer
was
that
it's
really
academic
to
whether
there's
a
liberty
interest,
a
new
one,
because
there
was
one
before
and
what
processes
do
doesn't
matter
on
how
many
liberty
interests
you
sort
of
stack
on,
one
on
top
of
another.
the
language
in
this
case,
given
that
all
that
congress
adopted
was
a
presumptive
sentencing
system.
i
don't
think
there
really
is
a
new
liberty
interest.
unlike
prior
cases
in
which...
like
greenholtz,
in
which
the
court
relied
very
much
on
the
shall
language,
congress,
in
enacting
the
sentencing
guidelines,
specifically
rejected
flat
time
and
mandatory
sentencing
processes
like
the
state
of
new
york's
which
would
have
given
rise
to
an
expectancy
that
one
get
a
particular
sentence.
it
rejected
both
that
and
indeterminate
sentencing
and
instead
adopted
minnesota's
procedure.
minnesota's
procedure
was
that
of...
was
of
presumptive
sentencing,
which
was
to
give
the
judge
a
presumptively
applicable
guidelines
range
which
the
judge
could
depart
from
is
he
or
she
stated
that
there
were
certain
reasons
calling
for
either
a
higher
or
lower
sentence.
i
don't
think
there's
enough
certainty
in
that
system
to
create
an
expectancy
to
create
a
new
liberty
interest--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--facing
directly
to
your
question,
justice
souter.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
it...
yes,
it
certainly
satisfied...
would
satisfy
the
notion
of
fairness.
under
the
prior
system
the
judge
could
say,
this
seems
like
a
gardenvariety
robbery.
i
think
it's
worth
no
more
than
2
years,
and
then
the
prosecutor
brings
out
a
bunch
of
other
information
or
highlights
the
facts
in
a
specially
egregious
way
and
says,
my
goodness,
i
think
you
deserve--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--justice
stevens,
i
think
that's
very
similar
to
what
could
very
well
have
happened
under
the
old
system
and
would
have
been
held
under
this
court's
precedent
as
fundamentally
fair.
prosecutor
makes
a
compelling
sentence--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well,
i
would
submit
that
what
the
constitution
has
considered
fair
under
the
due
process
clause
should
not
have
changed.
the...
congress
has
gone
beyond
that
and
enacted
additional
reforms
to
make
the
sentence
more
rational
and
fair.
the
perversity
of
the
due
process
argument
in
this
case
is
that
if
there
are
absolutely
no
holds
barred,
if
the
judge...
district
judge
had
absolutely
unfettered
discretion,
then
that's
fundamentally
fair.
but
now
that
congress
has
gone
beyond
that
and
given
a
guidelines
range,
a
right
to
appeal,
and
the
other
rights
provided
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
all
of
a
sudden
that's
not
fair
or
is
at
least
an
invitation
for
the,
the
court
under
a
cost
benefit
analysis
to--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--rachet
up
the
procedural
requirements.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
is
that
fair?
i
don't
think
it
would
be
wise
for
the
district
judge,
but
there
is
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
it's...
it
satisfies
the
text
of
the
rule
and
it's
ill
advised
of
the
judge,
but
it's
consistent
with
due
process.
this...
a
similar
thing
could
have
happened
under
the
old
system
and
there
are
additional
protections
under
the
current
system,
because
there's
essentially
a
right
to
de
novo
review
of
the
permissibility
of
the
departure
under
the
guidelines.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
you
do.
let
me
turn
to
that
right
now.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
oh.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i
didn't
understand
justice
stevens'
question
to
basically
have
all
the
parties
gather
in
the
sentencing
hearing
and
say
shut
up,
here's
the
sentence.
i
understood
him
to
say
that
they
had
talked
about
the
sentence
and
he'd
changed
his
mind
or
perhaps
i
was
under
the
wrong
hypothetical.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
he
certainly
has
to
listen
to
what
the
parties
have
to
say--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--uh-huh.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
okay.
that...
if
that's
the
question
you
were
asking,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
clearly
conforms
to
the
text
of
the
rule...
of
the
rule.
the
reason
is
the
rule
does
not
provide
access
to
the
judge's
thoughts
about
sentencing,
requires
no
advisory
sentence
of
any
sort.
the
parties
had
an
opportunity
to
address
the
other
matters
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence.
even
if
the
judge
does
not
tell
him
what
the
advisory
sentence
is--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well,
he
didn't
tell
him
no
to
comment.
he--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--he
suggested
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well,
not
to--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--then...
okay--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--clarified
in
that
way,
that
would
violate
the
rule.
i--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
the
reason
that
that
violates
the
rule
is
because
counsel
is
entitled
to
address
any
other
matter
related
to
the
sentence,
without
limitation.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
there
could
be
many
things
that
the
judge
does
not
disclose
that
he's
thinking
about,
and
counsel
can
address
anything
that
he
thinks
would
bear
on
the
exercise
of
the
judge's
discretion.
whether
he...
whether
the
judge
has
let
him
know
that
that
may
be
a
factor
or
has
told
him
that
as
things
currently
stand
that
is
not
a
factor.
under
the
old
system,
just
as
under
the
new,
you
have
to
put
your
best
case
forward.
under
the
system,
you
know
the
facts
as
set
up
in
the
presentence
report.
you
know...
you
have
a
copy
of
the
guidelines
and
you
have
counsel
and
then
you
run
with
it.
on
page
50
of
the
senate
report,
congress
made
very
clear
that
the
change
in
procedure
it
expected
under
the
guidelines
was
that
a
new,
more
highly
detailed
presentence
report
would
allow
the
parties
to
address
the
issues
and
prepare
for
the
sentencing
hearing.
there's
just
nothing
in
the
rules
that
require
a
judge
to
disclose
any
of
his
intentions
regarding
the
sentence.
there's
just
one
exception
to
that,
and
that's
the
18
u.s.c.
3553(d)
where
the
court,
the
district
judge,
is
required
to
give
notice
if
he
intends
to
impose
an
order
of
a
victim
notice.
but
that's
it.
everything
else
congress
wrote
against
a
background
tradition
in
sentencing
in
which
the
judge
did
not
have
to
disclose
its
preliminary
thoughts
on
the
sentence.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
if
there
was
a
separate
crime.
it
would
just
be--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that's
right.
it
would
be
an
illegal...
i
think
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
that's
not
correct--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--justice
scalia,
there's,
there's
not
a
specific
limit
as
i
understand
it
in
the
guidelines
on
the
extent
of
a
departure.
once
the
departure
is
authorized,
there's
a
right
to
an
appellate
review
of
the
reasonableness
of
that
extent.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
if
the...
correct,
if
the
guidelines
don't
consider
that
factor
or
don't
adequately
account
for
that
factor.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
that's--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
the
guidelines
do
a
lot,
but
it's
a
system,
again,
of
presumptive
sentencing.
it's
not
a
flat
range
that
judges
are
limited
to.
it's
a
range
that
is
limited
based
on
certain
factors
and
if
those
factors
aren't
adequately
considered
in
the
guidelines,
the
judges
can
depart.
that
was
the
basis
of
departure
in
this
very
case.
and
there
are
at
least
five
mechanisms
within
the
current
procedure
that
make
that
fair.
first
of--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
no,
no,
that's
not...
the
guidelines
are
a
bit
more
specific
than
that.
in
this
case,
for
example,
there
was
an
upward
departure
on
the
basis
of
concealment.
the
guideline
assumed
that
the
income
tax
evasion,
the
concealment,
was
$10,000
or
more...
or
more.
petitioner
evaded
income
taxes
to
the
tunes
of
almost
half
a
million
dollars
or
50
times
what
the
guidelines
presupposed.
that
was
one
basis
for
departure.
the
other
basis
for
departure
was
for
duration.
the
guidelines
specified,
"more
than
minimal
planning".
in
this
case,
there
was
much,
much,
much
more
than
minimal
planning.
the
guideline
presupposed
that
it
would
be
planning
typical
for
a
"simple
offense".
and
this
is
on
pages
14a
and
17a
of
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
opening
brief.
but
the
simple
of...
this
was
far
more
than
a
simple
offense.
this
was
8
years
of
embezzling
more
than
$1.2
million
from
the
government
via
53
fraudulent
checks.
that
was
far
more
than
just
a
simple
offense.
so
the
guidelines...
so
the
answer
to
your
question
i
think
is
that
the
guidelines
are
much,
much
more
specific
than
that.
they
don't
say
a
2-year
adjustment
is
all
you
can
give
for
youth.
they
provide
certain
point
adjustments
for
very
particular
offense
characteristics
and
very
particular
conduct.
and
conduct
could
well
exceed
what
is
presupposed
in
the
guidelines,
just
as
it
happened
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
the
district
judge
is
entitled
to
do
that.
whether
that
will
be
upheld
on
appeal
is
another
matter.
the
question
is
whether--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--the
question
is
whether--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no.
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
guidelines.
and
in
that
case,
with
a
guideline
specifying
in
$10,000
or
more,
$10,001
would
clearly
not
be
a
fair
reading
of
the
guideline
to
allow
for
a
further
upward
departure.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
no,
and
again,
i...
i
perhaps
am
not
making
it
clear,
but
the
guideline
system
are...
the
guidelines
are
based
on
quite
specific
conduct
and
you
can
have
conduct
far
in
excess
of
the
facts
presupposed
within
the
guidelines'
range,
just
as
what
happened
here.
the
guidelines
are
not
a
rule
that
says
any
conduct,
any
income
tax
evasion,
no
matter
how
far
above
$10,000
is
all
accounted
for
in
a
two-point
adjustment,
and
that's
the
difference
between
the
statutory
minima
and
maxima
that
was
the
system--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
that
is
correct,
justice--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
he
has
plenty
of
opportunities.
the
first
opportunity
came
when
he
read
the
guidelines.
the
guidelines
specify
the
adjustments
that
are
made.
they're
listed...
the
facts
are
listed
in
the
presentence
report.
that...
in
a
case
like
this,
it's
very
easy
to
tell
that
the
guide...
the
facts
presupposed
in
the
guidelines
don't
adequately
take
into
account
the
conduct
for
which
the
petitioner
was
convicted.
this
case
is
an
excellent
example.
on
pages
41
and
45
of
the
joint
appendix,
it's
very
clear
that
petitioner's
counsel
knew
that
an
upward
departure
was
a
possibility
in
this
case.
he
urged
the
court
to
consider
a
sentence
"within
the
guidelines",
and
he
argued
that
all
the
aggravating
factors
were
adequately
accounted
for
in
the
guidelines.
if
the
court
wants
to
hear
more
on
this,
it
can
specifically
invite
further
comment.
if
the
defendant
is
surprised,
he
can
file...
he
can
object
upon
hearing
the
sentence.
as
petitioner
did
here
with
respect
to
whether
he
could
voluntarily
surrender,
petitioner
in
fact
essentially
told
the
district
judge,
on
pages
60
and
61
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
he
was
going
to
file
an
appeal
on
the
departure
issue
but
chose
not
to
argue
that
question
before
the
district
judge
and
instead
argued
whether
he
should
be
able
to--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
don't
think
there
was
any
mistake.
i
think
that
everyone
knew
that
a
departure
was
a
possibility
here
and
that...
the
counsel...
the
petitioner
had--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i'm
sorry--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
i--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--there
was
no
mistake
about
the
money
involved.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
the
fact
was
clear
in
the
presentence
report
that
it
was
almost
a
half
a
million
dollars
of
income
taxes
evaded
and
the
judge
didn't
say
that
there
was
a
mistake
on
that.
she
just
said
that
was
far
in
excess
of
what
was
presupposed
by
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
think...
i
think
in
this
case
the
sentencing...
the
transcript
of
the
sentencing
hearing
makes
pretty
clear
that
everyone
knew
that
this
was
a
reasonable
candidate
for
departure.
yes,
and
the...
the
fact
that
petitioner's
counsel,
you
know,
didn't
raise
the
argument
and
object
to
the
departure
at
the
time
or
file
a
post-hearing
motion
is
because
it
was...
it
was
really
fruitless.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i
think
the
judge--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that's
not
contemplated
by
the
text
of
rule
32(a).
what
we
would
say
to
that
is
the
district
judge
in
its
discretion
and
common
sense,
if
it's
concerned
about
something,
he
can
certainly
let
the
parties
know
that
it's
the
party.
it
can
share--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
don't
think
the...
it...
the
rule
can
fairly
be
read
to
require
that.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there
are
two
sentences
in
rule
32(a)(1)
and
we've
only
talked
about
one
this
morning.
the
one
we've
talked
about
is
the
comment
sentence.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
there's
a
sentence
that
immediately
precedes
it
called
a
notice
sentence.
and
this
is
all
at
pages
7a
and
8a
in
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief.
the
notice
sentence
specifically
says
that
the
parties
get
notice
of
the
probation
officer's
determination
pursuant
to
subdivision
(c)(2)(b)
of
the
guidelines'
range
and
the
offender
characteristics.
the
comment
sentence
says
that
you
have
a
right
to
comment
on
that
determination
and
on
other
matters
relating
to
the
appropriate
sentence.
the
curious
thing
is
that
subdivision
(c)(2)(b),
the
cross-reference
subdivision,
includes
the
explanation
of
the
probation
officer
of
whether
there
is
a
fair
ground
for
a
departure
in
this
case.
so
a
fair
reading
of
the
notice
sentence
is
the
only
thing
that's
omitted
in
the
notice
requirement
in
rule
32
is
exactly
what
petitioner
asks
or
part
of
what
petitioner
asks
for
here,
which
is
some
advanced
notice
of
the
departure
decision.
reading
the
notice
and
the
comment
sentence
together
i
think
is
very
revealing
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
it
very
clearly
says
that
there's
a
right
to
comment,
not
a
right
to
notice.
it's
a
right
to
speak
your
mind
to
the
judge
on
anything
you
think
that
may
bear
on
the
sentence.
it's
not
a
right
to
be
informed
of
what
those
sentencing
matters
are.
second,
you
can't
imply
notice
in
the
comment
sentence
without
making
the
notice
sentence
superfluous.
in
other
words,
if
you
substitute
the
words
"notice
and
comment"
for
the
word
"comment",
there's
just
no
meaning
for
the...
no
purpose
that's
served
by
the
notice
sentence.
finally,
the
two
sentences
also
reveal
one
other
thing.
the
notice
sentence
only
requires
notice
of
the
probation
officer's
determination.
it
doesn't
require
notice
of
what
the
judge
is
thinking.
and
with
the
one
exemption...
exception
i
mentioned
earlier
about
a
judge's
intention
to
order
a
victim
notice,
there
is
nothing
that
has
changed
the
traditional
sentencing
practice.
the
judges
do
not
have
to
circulate
advisory
sentences
for
comment--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--justice
stevens,
the
sentencing
guidelines
passed
by
congress
contemplated
quite
a
few
departures,
in
fact,
about
20
percent
of
cases.
in
the
senate
report
it
notes
71.
the
committee
in
a
backhanded
way
says
that
there
were
20
percent
departures
in
the
parole
context.
we
expect
about
the
same
amount
of
departures
here.
the
senate
report
also
cross-references
to
the
minnesota
experience
as
the
only
state
which
had
a
system
like
the
one
that
it's
adopting.
in
minnesota
one
of
the
sources
in
the
footnote
cites
minnesota
had
a
departure
rate
of
greater
than
23
percent.
in
the
statute
itself
in
several
places
specifically
invites
judges
to
depart
in
order
to
individualize
sentencing.
so,
one...
i
guess
one
can
quibble
about
whether
the
glass
is
half
empty
or
half
full
or
whether
20
percent
departures
is
big
or
not.
but
departures
in
one-fifth
of
the
cases
is
departures
in
quite
a
few
cases
and
underscores
that
this
is
just
presumptive
sentencing--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--and
that
departure
is
a
realistic
possibility
in
all
these
cases
and
that
counsels
just
have
to
be
expected
to
address
that
concern.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--by
a
factor
of
2.5
to
1.
and
the
page...
there
are
page
references,
page
47
to
the
1989
annual
report,
there
are
3.5
percent
departures
of
upward
departures
above
the
guideline
range,
and
there
are
8.7
percent
departures
against
the
government
below
the
guidelines
range.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
not
requested.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
in
addition
to
those
departures,
there
are
in
departures
an
additional
5.8
percent
of
cases
for
substantial
assistant...
assistance
on
motion
of
the
government
and
that's
authorized
by
section
994(n)
of
28
u.s.c.--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
that's
the
perversity,
justice
kennedy.
it's
a
reverse
bitter
with
the
sweet
argument.
the
bitter-with-the-sweet
argument
goes
that
congress
gave
you
something
and
you
have
to
take
the
allegedly
poor
procedure
that
came
with
it.
in
this
case,
congress
gave
you
something
and
gave
you
a
nice
procedure,
too,
but
the
due
process
clause
can
be
used
to
rachet
it
up
even
more
so
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that's
right
and
it
hasn't
done
so
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter,
and
the
reason
is
that
defense
counsel
and
allocution
had
this
same
problem
before
the
sentencing
guidelines
were
passed
in
addressing...
in
trying
to
explain
away
a
potentially
very
damaging
or
unfortunate
fact
about
his
client's
arrest...
you
know,
criminal
history
or
something
else.
he
had
the...
he
was
forced
to
choose
between
bringing
that
up
and
putting
that
in
the
judge's
mind
or
not
raising
it
at
all
and
hope
the
judge
would
forget.
nothing
has
changed.
thank
you.
