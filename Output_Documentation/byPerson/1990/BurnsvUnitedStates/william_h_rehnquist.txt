chief

thank
you,
mr.
goldblatt.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
89-7260,
burns
against
the
united
states,
which
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
up
until
a
few
years
ago,
congress
wanted
to
enact
a
criminal
statue
making
certain
crimes
punishable
would
prescribe
the
broadened
sort
of
latitude
for
the
punishment.
they
would
say,
a
person
convicted
of
this
crime
shall
be
sentenced
for
not
less
than
one
or
more
than
ten
years,
leaving
it
entirely
up
to
the
district
judge
who
is
conducting
the
sentencing
hearing
to
fix
the
penalty
between
those
times.
but
a
few
years
ago,
congress
approved
sentencing
guidelines
which
took
a
much
different
approach
to
sentencing.
and
as
the
sentencing
commission,
which
has
promulgated
those
guidelines,
has
prescribed
very
detailed
provisions
as
to
how
a
judge
shall
go
about
sentencing
a
defendant
who
is
convicted
of
a
particular
crime.
and
one
thing
the
guidelines
provide
is
that
the
district
court
may
depart
upward,
to
impose
a
greater
sentence
than
the
guidelines
prescribe
under
certain
specified
conditions.
and
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
district
court
may
make
such
an
upward
departure
from
the
sentencing
range
established
by
the
sentencing
guidelines
without
first
notifying
the
parties
that
it
intends
to
do
that.
in
an
opinion
written
by
justice
marshall
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
court
holds
that
such
notice
is
required
by
rule
32
of
the
rules
of
federal
criminal
procedure,
because
the
petitioner
did
not
receive
notice
before
the
district
court's
upward
departure
at
his
sentencing,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
white
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined,
and
as
to
part
i
of
which,
i
have
joined.
