mr.
calvin
r.
koons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
the
starting
point
for
the
court's
analysis
in
this
case
should
begin
with
the
crawford
decision
rather
than
the
missouri
v.
jenkins
opinion.
in
crawford
the
court
specifically
said
that
the
$30
a
day
limit
for
attendance
fees
for
witnesses
in
federal
court
was
fully
applicable
to
expert
witnesses
and
further
said
that
this
limitation
would
be
respected
or
had
to
be
respected
by
federal
courts
unless
there
was
some
explicit
statutory
authorization
which
would
modify
the
limit.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
repeals
by
implication
were
not
favored
and
that
it
would
not
likely
infer
that
the
limitations
of
the
$30
a
day
limit
would
be
repealed
absent
some
statute
or
authority
explicitly
referring
to
witness
fees.
quite
simply,
1988...
section
1988
upon
which
petitioner
relies
to
shift
the
cost
of
expert
witness
fees
contains
no
specific
authorization.
it
contains
no
specific
authorization
either
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
which
refers
to
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
and
not
a
witness
fee,
nor
does
it
contain
any
explicit
statutory
authorization
in
the
legislative
history
which
contains
in
the
comments
and
the
floor
debates
no
reference
to
witness
fees
whatsoever.
and
finally,--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--what
i
read
the
statute
1988,
justice
stevens,
as
saying
is
that
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
is
allowed
as
part
of
the
costs.
i
interpret
that
as
adding
to
section
1928
u.s.c....
1920...
another
item
of
taxable
cost
in
the
form
of--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--that's
the
way
i
interpret
it.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
that's
correct,
your
honor,
we
did
not
challenge
them
in
this
case.
however,--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--well,
your
honor,
we
wanted
to
choose
our
issues,
and
the
decision
was
simply
made
that
we
would
not
contest
those
expenditures.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
well,
your
honor,
we
made
a
decision
as
to--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--i
think
some
of
those
expenditure
we
may
have
been
able
to
challenge.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
well,
justice--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--justice--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--excuse
me,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
many
of
those
items
probably
would
have
been
better
looked
at
as
cab
fare
and
so
forth
as
items
which
the
attorneys
would
absorb
on
terms
of
overhead
rather
than
billing
directly
to
the
client.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
what
i
would
consider
to
be
within
attorney's
fee,
your
honor,
in
conjunction
with
the
court's
decision
in
missouri
v.
jenkins,
is
work
which
is
performed
by
an
attorney,
work
which
is...
monies
which
can
be
incorporated
into
overhead
in
terms
of
the
lawyer's
office,
what
it
takes
him
to
run
his
office,
and
that,
i
think,
would
be
it.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
well,
your
honor,
there
might
be
a
few
things...
no,
i
would
have
to
say
that
that's
the
best...
correct--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--the
other
items
i
think
would
have
to
be
absorbed
in
perhaps
the
attorney's
rate.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
your
honor,
i
think
perhaps
they
could
be
in
connection
with
those
types
of
things
that
are
done
in
the
office
for
the
attorney
to
present
the
case,
although
i
point
out--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
phrase
reasonable
attorney's
fee
has
to
be
given
some
kind
of
meaning.
to
say...
to
say
simply--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--to
say
simply
that
it
means
all
expenses
of
litigation
is
really
to
deprive
it
of
any
meaning
whatsoever.
i
think,
justice
stevens--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--well,
your
honor,
if
accepted
that
earlier,
i
reject
it
because
if...
if
we
get
to
the
level
of
investigator
and
that
sort
of
thing--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
you've
suggested
in
missouri...
or
it
has
been
suggested
in
missouri
v.
jenkins
that
that
might
be
an
item
that
would
be
includable
at
least
as
overhead,
although
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
separately
billable.
but
in
any
case,
in
this
case
we
do
have
a
statute
which
specifically--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--well,
your
honor,
we
did...
that
did
actually
represent
a
compromise
of
a
claim.
we
did...
we
did
negotiate
a
settlement--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--well,
we
didn't
challenge
it
in
this
case,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
really
boils
down
to
this
that
they're
asking
the
court
to
rewrite
the
language
of
the
statute
because
they
say
that
its
purpose
would
be
better
served
and
that
it
would
be
a
better
law.
it
would
effectuate
congress'
purpose
better
if
it
included
more
things.
we
think
that
it
is
certainly
true
that
congress
intended
to
promote
private
enforcement
of
civil
rights
laws,
but
that
it
did
not
intend
to
write
a
blank
check.
it
chose
a
very
specific
means
to
do
that.
the
means
that
it
chose
was
to
award
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees
and
to
shift
that
major
expense
of
litigation
in
favor
of
the
prevailing
party.
it
did
this
also
to
make
legal
representation
available
to
civil
rights
plaintiffs.
it's
certainly
true
that
congress
could
have
done
more.
congress
could
have
said
that
it
wanted
to
provide
all
expenses
of
litigation.
it
could
have
said
it
wanted
to
award
treble
damages
or
liquidated
damages,
but
it
did
not.
now,
clearly
all
of
those
things
would
have
done
more
to
encourage
private
enforcement
of
civil
rights
actions.
but
congress
did
not
choose
those
avenues,
and
it
would
be
no
more
proper
to
write
into
the
law
an
expert
witness
fee
as
part
of
the
cost
than
it
would
be
to
include
those
items
as
well.
we
say
that
the
court
should
respect
the
limits
of
the
language
that
congress
used,
which
deserve
certainly
as
much
respect
as
the
ends,
as
well
as
respect
the
limits
that
congress
set
on
taxable
costs
in
1920
and
1821.
secondly,
we
say
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
show
that
congress
meant
to
include
expert
witness
fees.
the
fees...
the
only
reference
that
petitioner
can
point
to
are
several
witnesses
who
at
the
subcommittee
level
requested
that
expert
fees
added...
would
be
added.
the
issue
of
witness
fees
is
never
mentioned
in
any
report
or
in
floor
debates
and
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
of
clear
congressional
intent,
such
as
the
court
in
crawford
said
it
would
require,
even
by
examining
a
legislative
history.
congress
specified
in
other
pieces
of
litigation
when
it
wanted
to
award
expert
witness
fees
as
part
of
the
costs.
for
example,
in...
many
cases
which
we've
cited
at
pages
34
and
37
or
statutes
of
our
brief,
congress
specified
reasonable
attorney's
fees
as
well
as
expert
witness
fees.
some
of
these
statutes
were
passed
right
around
the
time
the
amendments
to
section
1988
were
being
debated,
the
toxic
substance
act,
for
example,
the
natural
gas
pipe
line
safety
act,
and
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act.
so,
it
does
appear
that
congress
knew
how
to
specify
both
expert
fees
and
attorney's
fees
when
it
wanted
to
do
so,
and
here
it
did
not.
we
say,
again,
that
the
result
that
we're
urging
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
court's
decision
in
missouri
v.
jenkins,
because
in
that
case
we
did
not
have
a
specific
statute
which
governed
the
item
of
cost
as
we
have
here
and
in
addition
it
is
a
different
thing
we
think
to
say
that...
that
attorney's
fees
may
include
paralegal
time
than
to
say
that
it
may
include
expert
witness
time.
paralegals
are
a
separate
class
of
legal
assistant
who
are
trained
in
the
law
and
who
typically
do
for
lawyers
at
a
cheaper
rate
that
kind
of
work
that
they
would
have
to
do
themselves
otherwise.
they
do
work
which
typically
eventuates
into
a
legal
work
product.
that's
not
the
case
with
expert
witnesses
or
with
any
witness.
witnesses
are
in
the
business
of
giving
testimony
of
producing
evidence,
and
we
think
that
to
apply
the
term
attorney's
fee
to
witnesses
would
really
be
to
distort
it
beyond
all
recognition
and
deprive
it
of
all
meaning
whatsoever.
in
conclusion,
we
think
our
construction
fairly
gives
effect
to
all
three
statutes
as
congress
wrote
them,
is
fully
in
accordance
with
crawford
and
is
not
inconsistent
with
jenkins,
and
respects
the
fact
that
in
some
statues
congress
chose
to
shift
both
expert
fees
and
attorney's
fees
and
in
other
statute
it
did
not.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
yes,
justice
scalia.
our
position--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--our
position
would
be
that
it
would
not
be,
because
it
is
not
work
done
by
an
attorney
that
results
in
a
legal
work
product,
although,
of
course,
the
court
would
be
free
to
resolve...
reserve
that
issue
for
another
day--
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
--as
the
witnesses
here
were
purely
testimonial
witnesses.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
i
think
not,
your
honor.
under
our
construction,
it
would
not
be
work
done
by
an
attorney
and
it
wouldn't
be...
wouldn't
be
compensatory.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
we
interpret
that
phrase,
your
honor,
as
referring
to
those
people
that
are
necessary
in
the
running
of
the
attorney's
office
and
who
assist
the
attorney
in
generating
the
work
product.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
it
may
not
be,
your
honor,
but
that
is...
that
is
our
construction
of
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
r.
koons
i
think...
that
is
our
construction.
