justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
42
u.s.c
section
1988,
which
permits
the
award
of
"a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs,"
includes
the
award
of
fees
for
services
rendered
by
scientific
and
other
experts
who
assist
in
the
preparation
or
presentation
of
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
held
that
it
does
not,
and
we
agree.
in
crawford
sitting
company
versus
j.t.
gibbons,
incorporated,
we
held
that
litigation
costs
may
not
be
shifted
to
the
loosing
party
absent
explicit
statutory
authority
to
the
contrary.
the
hospital
in
this
case
argues
that
section
1988,
in
shifting
an
attorney's
fee,
provide
such
authority
with
respect
to
expert
services,
we
think
not.
statutory
usage
both
before
and
after
the
enactment
of
section
1988
did
not
regard
the
phrase
attorney's
fee
as
embracing
fees
for
expert
services
to
the
contrary,
numerous
statutes
explicitly
shift
expert
fees
in
addition
to
attorney's
fees.
moreover,
judicially
usage
at
the
time
of
section
1988's
enactment
did
not
regard
expert
fees
as
a
component
of
attorney's
fees.
in
particular,
when
applying
fee-shifting
provisions
parallel
to
those
of
section
1988,
such
as
those
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
federal
patent
laws,
courts
thought
that
expert
fees
could
not
be
shifted
as
part
of
the
statutorily
authorized
attorney's
fee.
we
think
the
statutory
and
judicial
background
conclusively
establishes
that
attorney's
fees
and
expert
fees
are
distinct,
and
we
read
1988
to
comport
with
this
ordinary
usage.
whereas
here,
a
statute
contains
a
phrase
that
is
unambiguous,
the
court's
sole
function
is
to
enforce
it
according
to
its
terms.
we
do
not
find
it
persuasive
that
some
members
of
congress
viewed
section
1988
as
a
response
to
our
decision
in
alyeska
pipeline
service
company
versus
wilderness
society
where
we
narrowed
court's
equitable
fee-shifting
powers.
or
that
certain
members
stated
and
reports
or
debates
that
section
1988
was
to
be
a
broad
remedy.
the
best
evidence
of
congressional
purposes
of
the
statutory
text
which
cannot
be
expanded
or
contracted
by
the
statements
of
individual
legislators
or
committees
during
the
enactment
process.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed.
