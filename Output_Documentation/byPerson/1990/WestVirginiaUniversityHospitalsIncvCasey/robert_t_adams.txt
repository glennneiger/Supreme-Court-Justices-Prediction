mr.
robert
t.
adams
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
experts'
fees
are
compensable
under
the
provisions
of
42
u.s.c.
section
1988.
west
virginia
university
hospitals
asked
the
court
to
decide
this
issue
in
the
only
way
that
would
achieve
congress'
stated
intent
to
give
civil
rights
litigants
the
opportunity
to
recover
what
it
cost
them
to
vindicate
their
rights
in
court.
the
fee-shifting
provision
in
section
1988,
intended
by
congress
to
be
a
full
and
complete
remedy,
enables
the
federal
courts
to
return
to
their
pre-alyeska
fee-shifting
practices,
and
those
practices
included
the
shifting
of
experts'
fees.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
we
say
that
expert
fees
are
part
of
the
attorney's
fee,
because
they
are
part
of
the
work
product.
in
other
words,
reasonable
attorney's
fee
is
a
term
of
art.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
concededly--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--concededly
they
are
not,
but
before
the...
before
the
attorney
can
do
his
work,
he's
got
to
work
with
that
expert
so
he
knows
how
to
present
his
client's
case
and
how
to
prove
it.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
but
with
respect
to
expert
witnesses,
it's
particularly
important
because
when
you're
dealing
with
civil
rights
litigation,
it's
a
rare
case
when
you
can
have
that
kind
of
litigation
go
forward
without
an
expert.
i
think
the
thing
that
drives
that--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--that's
true,
but
if
you
have
fact
witnesses
you
subpoena
them
and
they
come
to
trial
and
they're
going
to
testify.
expert
witnesses
unfortunately
have
rents
to
pay,
college
tuitions
to
pay
and
they
normally
will
request
some
fee
for
their
services.
but
i
think
the
point
that
drives
us
home
is
the
fact
that
when
congress
enacted
the
fee-shifting
provision
in
section
1988,
it
did
not
sail
into
uncharted
waters.
instead,
it
selected
the
language
of
title
vii's--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--yes,
sir,
i
do.
we
would
respectfully
submit--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--the
expert
can
be
a
witness.
sometimes
he
is
not.
in
this
particular
case
it
turned
out
that
all
of
our
experts
ended
up
testifying.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
we
would
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
starting
point
for
this
court's
analysis
of
this
issue
ought
to
be
the
same
starting
point
that
this
court
employed
in
the
case
of
missouri
v.
jenkins.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
just
doesn't
pay
and
quite
candidly,
your
honor,
in
today's
litigation
the
attorney
i
think
most
often
goes
out,
finds
the
experts,
gets
them
acquainted
with
the
case
so
they
can
do
their
work,
and
in
most
instances,
even
though
there
may
be
the
initial
expectation
that
the
fee
is
going
to
be
paid
for
by
the
client,
i
can
assure
you
that
that
expert
is
going
to
look
to
that
lawyer
in
the
law
firm
to
makes
sure
that
he
bill
gets
paid
to
some
extent.
and
that's
very
important
to
a
lawyer,
because
if
he
is
able
to
find
quality
people
to
be
experts
and
all
of
a
sudden
his
experts
don't
get
paid,
i
would
submit
that
it's
going
to
be
very
hard
for
that
attorney
to
attract
that
expert
again
or
other
experts
of
like
quality
when
they
hear
that
their
fee
is
going
to
go
unsatisfied.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i
think
that
is
probably
the
best
argument
that
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
has.
but
i
think
when
the
argument
is
examined,
it
doesn't
wash
and
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
just
as
an
initial
matter,
you
would
have
to
completely
ignore
the
legislative
intent
behind
the
fee-shifting
provision
in
section
1988.
secondly,
what
you're
really
suggesting
is
that
congress
must
use
particular
words
and
particular
ways
every
time
it
legislates.
you
effectively
place
congress
into
a
legislative
drafting
straightjacket
which
is
pretty
much
akin
to
the
way
we
used
to
have
old
common
law
pleading,
and
courts
and
lawyers
who
were
trained
in
pleading
found
that
to
be
an
unworkable
situation.
and
i
would
submit
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
place
congress
in
an
equivalent
situation.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
it
is
not.
but
when
you
find
plain
evidence
of
a
legislative
intent
to
work
some
other
result,
then
the
result
would
be
if
you
followed
a
plain
language
construction--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
and
for
this
reason.
if
you
examine
both
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report,
both
reports
specifically
comment
that
they
are
selecting
title
vii's
fee-shifting
language
and
they
say
the
reasons
for
that
selection...
they
said,
number
1,
the
courts
are
familiar
with
these
terms.
they
have
interpreted
these
terms
and
have
given
them
meaning,
and
furthermore
they
cite
case
law
that
have
interpreted
title
vii's
fee-shifting
language.
and
when
you
examine
that
case
law,
they
have
interpreted
title
vii's
language
to
embrace
experts'
fees.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i
think
that's
the
presumption,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i
think
that's
the
evidence
that
would
be
before
the
court,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
to
contradict
that
particularly
when
you
examine--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--i
would
disagree.
i'm
aware
that
you
in
some
of
your
opinions
have
approached
legislative
history
in
a
different
way
than
perhaps
we
would--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--but
i
think,
your
honor,
when
you
look
at
the
entire
set
of
contemporaneous
circumstances
that
surrounded
the
enactment
of
this
fee-shifting
provision,
it
is
absolutely
clear
in
my
opinion
that
the
congress
wanted
to
abrogate
the
effects
of
alyeska
with
respect
to
civil
rights
litigation.
and
they
were
particularly
concerned
that
when
they
took
this
legislative
action
that
they
supply
something
that
was
a
meaningful
and
fully
compensatory
remedy.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
well,
unfortunately
i
think
everybody
concluded
from
reading
your
opinion,
justice
white,
that
it
had--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--you're
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
everybody
assumed
and
i
believe
correctly
so
that
based
upon
that
opinion
it
would
be
a
very
weak
argument
to
suggest
that
that
opinion
did
not
reach
to
expert
fees.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i
don't
think
you
have
said
it
in
those
terms,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
abandoned
the
notion
that
legislative
reports
and
whatever
legislative...
other
legislative
history
exists
is
not
something
appropriate
to
look
at
and--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--i
think
in
this
case,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--i
think
to
people
who
are
aware
of--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--i
think
it
is
ambiguous
to
the
uninitiated.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
certainly
not,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
t.
adams
if--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--if
there
was
no
legislative--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--history.
it
was
just
this
statute,
i
would
probably
not
be
sitting
here
today.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
if
there
were
not
this
legislative
history--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--if
there
were
not
this
set
of
contemporaneous
circumstances--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--if
all
you
do
is
look
to
the
four
corners
of
this
statute,
if
you
are
not
willing
to
ask
the
additional
question
of
what
else
was
congress
trying
to
do,
yes,
i
think
i
do
lose.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
yes.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
and
i
think
that's
the
significance
of
this
court's
beginning
of
its
analysis
in
the
missouri
v.
jenkins
case.
because
in
the
very
initial
part
of
that
decision,
it's
apparent
to
me
that
this
court
considered
and
rejected
the
plain
language
argument
that's
being
advanced
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
today.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i
believe
it
was
7
to
1.
i
believe
that
justice
marshall--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--i
will
defer
to
you,
justice
stevens.
i
believe
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
that
decision.
i
hope
to
get
his
vote
today.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
t.
adams
they
clearly
are
and
so
are--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--with
respect,
i
would
disagree.
i
think
you
are...
i
think
with...
that
you're
trying
to
draw
a
distinction
based
upon
employment
relationships
and
i
think
judge
posner's
decision
for
the
seventh
circuit
is
particularly
good
in
explaining
that
if
you
really
examine
that,
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
very
appropriate
basis
for
a
distinction.
you
can
have...
you've
got
a...
you
pay
for
a
paralegal
in
order
to
make
this
fully
complete
remedy,
but
you
don't
pay
for
the
expert
and
yet
the
expert
probably
provides
a
far
more
valuable
service
and
the
attorney
needs
access
to
his
services
more
than
he
does
his
own
paralegal.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
with
respect,
i
would
disagree.
i
read...
i
read
that
his
decision
as
indicating
that
any
person
whose
labor
has
contributed
to
the
work
product
of
the
attorney
ought
to
have--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--as
broadly
as
this
court
has
construed
that.
in
my
particular
situation,
of
course,
your
honor,
your...
this
court--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--i
think
i
am
talking--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--about
the
person,
because
if
you
were
to
decide
this
case
against
my
client,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
have
established
a
precedent,
not
just
for
my
client
who
had
the
fortune
of
having
some
kind
of
cash
flow,
but
you'd
have
also
set
a
precedent
for
the
individual
who
did
not
have--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--not
true,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
why.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
b48
in
the
petition's...
appendix.
there
the
district
court
discusses
the
testimony
of
dr.
james
vertrees,
who
was
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania's
expert.
and
the
reason
the
district
court
was
discussing
that
particular
testimony
was
that
dr.
vertrees
had
clearly
testified
that
the
imposition
of
pennsylvania's
payment
system
on
a
hospital
such
as
my
client
had
the
potential,
the
real
potential
of
bankrupting
a
large
university
teaching
hospital.
and
that's
particularly
serious
in
a
medicaid
program,
because
if
you
examine
the
legislative
history
to
the
social
security
act
you
will
find
that
congress
had
an
express
concern
for
these
large
teaching
hospitals
that...
to
put
it
bluntly...
are
the
dumping
grounds
of...
for
poor
patients.
and
so
my
client
as
i
said...
it
had
a
cash
flow,
but
i
would
respectfully
submit
my
client
did
not
have
a
deep
pocket
that
was
unending.
so,
it's
very
important
if
we're
going
to
continue
to
deliver...
in
my
client's
case...
needed
health
care
to
our
indigent
citizens
that
they
are
able
to
recover
what
it
costs
them
to
vindicate
their
rights
in
federal
court.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
with
respect
that
this
court
has
not
shied
away
from
rejecting
plain
language
arguments
when
it
has
come
to
section
1988.
missouri
v.
jenkins
was
not
the
first
time
this
court
so
held.
i
would
point
you
specifically
to
the
christiansburg
garment
case
where
you
rejected
that
kind
of
argument
because
it
would
have
frustrated
congress'
intend.
likewise
in
related
fee-shifting
statutes,
eaja,
for
example,
the
clean
air
act
shifting
statute,
you
have
not
given
any
credence
to
arguments
based
on
minor
variations
in
language
between
one
statute
and
another.
you
have
been
more
concerned
about
ensuring
that
congress'
intent
behind
those
statutes
was
followed.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
your
honor,
i
don't
know
really
how
to
answer
that
other
than
to--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--i
disagree,
because
i
think
if
congress
was
truly
serious
about
making
any
kind
of
promise
to
the
american
people
it
had
to
be
a
substantial
promise
not
a
hollow
promise,
and
i
would
submit
it
is
a
hollow
promise
if
expert
witnesses
cannot
be
made
available
to
all
civil
rights
litigants.
i
would
also
respectfully
submit
that
the
adoption
of
the
construction
that
we
are
proffering
to
the
court
is
fully
consistent
with
the
notion
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
remedial
statute
that
is
entitled
to
a
broad
construction.
furthermore,
we
believe
that
that
notion
of
a
broader
construction
than
the
one
being
offered
up
by
pennsylvania
is
also
consistent
with
the
notion
of
work
product
as
we
find
that
mentioned
in
the
jenkins
case,
because
this
court
has
said
that
the
work
product
doctrine
is
an
intensely
practical
doctrine
grounded
in
the
realities
of
litigation,
and
experts
are
a
reality
of
litigation
whether
we
like
it
or
not.
west
virginia's
construction,
we
believe,
is
fully
consistent
with
every
expression
of
legislative
intent
that
we
can
find.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
if
an--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--a
qualified
yes,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
the
qualification.
as
we
understand
the
legislative
history
behind
section
1988,
congress
intended
to
restore
the
courts
to
what
their
practice
had
been
in
fee-shifting
prior
to
the
alyeska
decision.
i
am
not
here
to
suggest
that
that
means
that
we
should
vest
into
the
federal
courts
the
ability
to
further
expand
whatever
that
equitable
fee-shifting
policy
was.
instead
i'm
suggesting
whatever
it
was
in
1975
that's
what
congress
intended
to
give
back.
now,
if
investigators...
which
are
not
a
part
of
this
case...
but
if
investigators
had
been
considered
a
part
of
the
appropriate
fee
shifting
under
pre-alyeska
practice,
yes,
i
would
give
you
the...
i...
a
yes
answer
to
that.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
yes,
sir,
and
the
court
exercising
its
discretion,
and
if
you
examine
our
footnote
15
on
page
18
of
the
opening
brief,
you'll
see
what
we
hope
is
a
fairly
complete
list
of
the
reported
cases
on
that
point.
we
have
certainly
found
no
reported
case
that
suggests
otherwise
nor
have
we
seen
any
case
cited
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
for
a
contrary
position.
well,
we
believe
that
the
construction
that
we
would
offer
to
you
today
is
consistent
with
the
intent
to
encourage
the
private
enforcement
of
civil
rights.
we
think
it's
consistent
with
the
notion
of
creating
a
broad
remedy.
we
think
it's
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
equalizing
the
resources
between
the
litigants
and
we
do
think
it
is
fully
consistent
with
a
continuation
of
the
pre-alyeska
practice.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i've
given
that
a
great
deal
of
thought,
your
honor,
and
i
can
say
that,
yes,
you
can
probably
construct
an
argument
where
you
could
draw
the
line
in
that
fashion,
but
i
don't
really
think
that's
the
correct
place
to
draw
the
line.
the
reason
being--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--yes,
ma'am...
yes,
your
honor,
but
two
responses
to
qualify
my
answer.
number
one,
if
you
examine
the
provisions
of
section
1821
which
was
the
subject
matter
of
crawford,
clearly
congress...
there's
a
clear
recognition
that
congress
might
come
in
with
some
other
fee-shifting
statute
to
supplant
1821,
1920,
and
54.
and
we
believe
1988
is
such
a
statute.
and
my
second
point
has
just
gone
out
of
my
head
and
i
apologize
for
that.
but
going
back
to
pennsylvania's
arguments.
we
believe
when
you
examine
their
arguments
that
they
are
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
expressions
of
legislative
intent
that
we
can
find
for
this
statute.
it
would
not
encourage
private
enforcements
at
least
in
those
cases
where
the
civil
rights
plaintiff
does
not
have
the
means
to
proceed.
it's
not
a
fully
complete
remedy.
it's
an
incomplete
remedy.
there
certainly
would
be
no
level
playing
field
between
a
state
actor
who
can
access
the
state
treasury
and
the
private
litigant.
and
lastly,
the
pre-alyeska
practice
simply
is
not
restored.
we
think
in
the
final
analysis
reasonable
attorney's
fee
is
a
term
of
art.
it's
just
as
judge
posner
described
it
in
the
friedrich
case.
it's
a
shorthand
expression.
and
i
can
only
go
back
and
iterate
the
point
that
i
made
earlier,
that
congress
did--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--i
think
the
way
he
phrased
it
is
it's
a
shorthand
expression
for
what
the
courts
were
doing,
what
was
taken
away
from
them,
and
what
congress
then
restored
to
them.
and
that's
why
i
would
go
back
to
the
point
where
if
we
try
to
draw
lines
between
testimonial
and
nontestimonial
services,
it
seems
to
me
that
really
the
better
approach
is
to
look
at
what
pre-alyeska
practice
was,
and
i
don't
believe
that
line
drawing
took
place
at
that
time.
i
see
that
my
time
is
about
up.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
thank
you.
with
respect
i
would
disagree
with
mr.
koons'
statement
that
the
witnesses
in
this
case
were
purely
testimonial.
that
is
not
correct,
and
i
believe
that
the
bills
that
we
have
supplied
to
you
in
the
appendix
demonstrate
that
for
2
years,
for
2
years
before
we
got
to
trial
we
were
working
hand
in
glove
with
these
experts
in
how
to
draft
the
pleading,
and
how
to
develop
discovery
strategy,
and
how
to
assess
and
analyze
the
discovery
results
that
we
were
finally
given
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
and
that
is
not
correct,
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
myself
and
my
colleague,
mrs.
krebs,
who
essentially
located
the
experts
for
the
hospital
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
a
case
to
bring
in
view
of
the
hospital's
belief
that
they
were
not
getting
paid
the
right
amount
of
money.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
the
record
doesn't
reflect,
but
i
will
stipulate
that
the
billing
did
go
straight
from
the
experts
to
the
client
after
it
had
been
approved
by
me.
but
i
think
the
point
that's
so
crucial,
particularly
in
modern
civil
rights
litigation,
is
that
lawyers
do
not
sit
in
their
ivory
tower
by
themselves.
they
sit
there
next
to
their
experts,
and
if
you
deny
the
attorney
access--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--your
honor,
i
stayed
so
far
away
from
the
antitrust
laws
i
would
not
even
want
to
hazard
a
guess
on
that.
i
don't
have
an
answer
for
you.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i
really
do
not.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
that's
true,
but
you
know
there
is
one
unique
distinction
about
1988
in
comparison
to
all
these
other
fee-shifting
statutes
that
we
have.
and
that
is,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
1988
is
a
statute
which
addresses
not
only
violations
of
federal
statutory
law
that
is
the...
in
place
to
address
constitutional
violations.
we
have
one
in
this
case,
a
violation
found
by
the
district
court
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
i
find
it
somewhat
amazing
that
you
could
have
a
fee-shifting
statute
that,
granted,
is
part
of
a
very
important
national
policy
for
the
environment
which
covers
the
experts,
but
when
you
get
to
the
area
of
constitutional
violations,
congress
was
somehow
inept
and
didn't
cover
fees
in
that
arena?
it
just
doesn't
make
sense,
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
that
may
be
true,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
today
if
we
are
to
give
honor
to
this
notion
of
work
product,
this
intensely
practical
doctrine,
i
think
the
court
ought
to.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
if
it
had
the
same
legislative
history
as--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--my
case
is
only
about
a
civil
rights
violation
under
section
1988.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
in
this
case,
we
were
fortunate
that
the
people--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
you
should
get
fees
for
both
functions.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
our
position
would
be.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
what
is
a
fact?
yes,
until,
until
the
courts--
mr.
robert
t.
adams
--you're
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
t.
adams
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
it
would
depend
on
what
he
was
testifying
about,
but,
yes,
i
guess
he
could
qualify
as
an
expert
witness.
