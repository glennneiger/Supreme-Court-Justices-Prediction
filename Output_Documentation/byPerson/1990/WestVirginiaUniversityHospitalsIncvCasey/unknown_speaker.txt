unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
adams,
what
the
statute
says
i
guess
is
that
court
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs.
now
do
you
say
expert
fees
are
attorney's
fees
or
do
you
say
they
are
other
parts
of
the
costs?
unknown
speaker
even
though
concededly
experts
are
not
attorneys.
unknown
speaker
and
they
don't
do
attorneys'
work.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
true
of
any
witness.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true
of...
you
can
say
that
about
any...
you
can't
win
a
lawsuit
without
a
witness
unless
it's
just
a
question
of
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
an
attorney...
an
attorney
can
certainly
get...
they
can
get
attorney's
fees
and
they
can
recover
a
fee
that
reflects
the
time
the
attorney
spent
with
an
expert
witness.
if
he...
he
goes
and
finds
them
and
he
forks
him
up,
and
he
knows
his
testimony.
he
can
get
him
an
attorney's
fee
for
that.
but
you
say
that
included
in
the
attorney's
fees
is
the
separate
sum
that
he
must
pay
the
expert?
unknown
speaker
and
he...
and
the
expert
is
a
witness?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would...
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
even
if
these
experts
did
not
testify?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
that's...
because
you
say
the
$30
provision
just
doesn't
cover
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
adams,
i
guess
there
are
a
number
of
federal
statutes
where
there
is
express
provision
made
for
expert
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
and
their
fees?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
not
done
in
section
1988.
should
that
be
a
concern
to
us?
congress
knows
how
to
provide
for
them
expressly.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
it's
not
unreasonable
to
think
that
we
should
apply
the
common
ordinary
understanding
of
the
words
that
congress
does
choose
to
employ.
that's
not
putting
congress
in
a
straightjacket,
would
you
say?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it's
just
a
little
bit
of
a
stretch
isn't
it
to
say
an
attorney's
fee
includes
fees
paid
to
experts?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
you
think
that
every
committee
member
who
signed
on
to
that
report
not
only
read
those
cases
and
knew
that
that's
what
those
cases
said...
that
they
covered
not
only
attorney's
fees
but
also
expert
fees.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
also
the
presumption
not
only
that
the
other
members
of
the
congress
read
those
committee
reports,
but
also
that
the
other
members
of
congress
also
read
those
cases
that
were
cited
in
the
committee
reports,
even
though
the
committee...
as
i
understand
it
the
committee
reports
don't
even
say
explicitly
that
experts'
fees
are
covered.
unknown
speaker
all
they
do
is
cite
these
cases
which
had
held
that
experts'
fees
were
covered.
unknown
speaker
and
the
theory
of
the
matter
is
that
from
that
citation
of
the
cases
we
can
be
sure
that
the
whole
committee
and
the
whole
congress
intended
expert
fees
to
be
covered.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
the
evidence
of
the
language
which
says
attorney's
fees
and
the
evidence
of
other
statutes
which
say
attorney's
fees
and
expert
fees
are
recoverable.
now,
if
i'm
a
member
of
congress
and
voting
on
that
statute,
i'm
not
going
to
go
and
read
a
committee
report
and
then
read
the
cases
cited
in
the
committee
report.
i'm
going
to
know
that
when
we
say
attorney's
fees,
we
mean
attorney's
fees
and
when
we
say
attorney's
fees
and
expert
fees,
we
mean
both.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
much
more
reasonable
to
assume?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
this
goes
beyond
legislative
history.
this
goes
relying
on
nothing
but
the
name
of
a
case
which
you
expect
the
members
of
congress
to
have
read.
unknown
speaker
well,
alyeska
just
dealt
with
attorney's
fees.
they
didn't
deal
with
expert
witnesses.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
my
opinion.
it
was
the
court's
opinion.
unknown
speaker
this
presumption
that
the
members
of
congress
or
at
least
the
committee
have
read
all
the
cases,
have
we
said
there's
that
presumption?
unknown
speaker
when
the
statutory
language
is
ambiguous--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
attorney's
fees
is
ambiguous,
so
that
just
reading
that
language
it
might
include
expert
witness
fees?
unknown
speaker
you
can
answer
that
question
yes
or
no,
and
then
you
can
explain
your--
unknown
speaker
--of
whom
do
the
uninitiated
consist?
like
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
absent
any
legislative
history,
would
you
say
the
language
is
ambiguous?
unknown
speaker
absent
any
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
none.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
it
would
not
be
ambiguous?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
this
is
a
plain
language
case
and
i
lose.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you'd
lose
the
paralegal
case,
too,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
we
rejected
it
8
to
1,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
think
it's
8
to
1
on
the
question
whether
any
paralegals
were
allowed.
only
the
chief
justice
ruled
and
said,
no
fees
at
all
for
paralegals.
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
there's
quite
a
difference
between
paralegals
and
expert
witnesses.
paralegals
are
in
essence
doing
part
of
the
attorney's
work,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
expert
witnesses
are
perhaps
more
like
independent
contractors
in
a
sense.
they're
outside
a
law
office
and
the
lawyer's
work.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
disagree
with
missouri
v.
jenkins,
because
that
was
the
rationale
of
justice
brennan.
he
said
that
attorney's
fees
include
secretaries,
those
that
are
integral
to
the
operation
of
the
office.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
page
2470,
that
that's
all
he
means.
unknown
speaker
no,
for
which
an
attorney
bills
the
client.
--bills
the
client.
before
the
attorney
can
bill
his
client
for
a
successful
prosecution
of
a
civil
rights
claim,
he
has
got
to
work
with
that
expert.
he
cannot
even
seriously
consider
taking
the
case
unless
he
knows
there
is
some
reasonable
expectation
in
a
meritorious
civil
rights
case
of
being
able
to
pay
that
expert.
when
you
refer
to
civil
rights
cases,
uh,
you
obviously
refer
to
your
own
case
here
where
the
west
virginia
university
hospital
sued
the
state
of
pennsylvania
or
sued
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
on
a
statute
where
it
claimed
it
had
some
entitlements.
so
you're
really
not
talking
about
civil
rights
in
any
narrow
sense.
you're
talking
about
any
plaintiff
who
has
a
claim
under
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
and
you
aren't
talking
about
somebody
who
couldn't
independently...
wouldn't
independently
have
the
money
to
pay
the
expert.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
but
your
client
has
the
money
to
pay
the
expert.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
except
that,
you
know,
if
we
ignore
the
plain
language
of
what
the
statute
and
says
and
goes
to
what
congress
intended,
i
doubt
whether
very
many
members
of
congress
thought
that
civil
rights
actions
consisted
of
suits
by
hospitals,
for-profit
hospitals,
some
of
them,
for
millions
of
dollars
that
were
wrongfully
withheld
under
a
statute
for
medicaid
treatments.
i
don't...
how
many
members
of
congress
do
you
think
would
consider
that
a
civil
rights
action.
that's
what
they
had
in
mind
when
they
were
talking
about
civil
rights
actions?
i
doubt
very
many.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
way
to
answer
it
is
the
statute
says
what
it
says
and
it
describes
this
kind
of
an
action
and
that's
good
enough.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
can
also
make
the
same
argument
about
private
investigators
and
private
detectives?
unknown
speaker
here's
a
case...
here's
a
case
that
a
lawyer
wants
to
hire
an
investigator
to
find
out
the
facts
and
find
some
witnesses,
and
he
just
won't
get
off
the
ground
without
him?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
prior
to
alyeska
it
was
an
accepted
practice
to
shift...
shift
the
cost
for
expert
witness
fees
to
the
loser?
unknown
speaker
mr.
adams,
i
suppose
in
any
event
if
these
witnesses
were
to
testify
in
court
that
the
crawford
case
would
limit
the
payment
to
$30
a
day.
unknown
speaker
crawford
said
at
least
in
the
opinion
that
expert
witnesses
are
limited
by
the
statute
to
$30
a
day,
absent
explicit
authorization
to
the
contrary.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
the
shorthand
expression
for
what?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
adams.
mr.
koons,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
interpretation
of
the
plain
language,
just
focusing
on
the
language
for
a
minute?
do
you
read
the
statute
as
saying
it
authorizes
the
prevailing
party
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
recover,
one,
attorney's
fees;
and
secondly,
where
it
says
costs,
does
that
mean
taxable
costs
to
you?
what
does
the
word
costs
mean?
and,
of
course,
the
witness
fee
of
$30
a
day
would
be
a
taxable
cost.
unknown
speaker
so,
it's...
other
than
attorney's
fees
and
those
items
that
are
taxable
by
statute
is
cost,
that's
it?
unknown
speaker
i'm
putting
aside
for
a
moment
the
paralegal
problem
because
i...
what
about
things
about
justice
white
indicated
investigators,
telephones,
xerox,
transportation
to
depositions,
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
taxable
as
costs
but
are
commonly
billed
by
lawyers
to
their
clients
as
expenditures
or
disbursements
and
i
noticed
in
this
case
there
are
$45,000
of
disbursements
that
you
did
not
challenge,
most
of
which
were
not
taxable
costs.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
if
the
language
was
as
plain
as
you
say
it
is?
unknown
speaker
you're
just
giving
the
state's
money
away,
weren't
you,
under
your
view
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
under
view
of
the
case
you
could
have
challenged
most
of
the
$45,000?
unknown
speaker
well,
including
cab
fare
for
the
attorney
to
get
to
the
deposition?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
meant
by
attorney's
fees
anything
that
the
attorney
would
normally
bill
to
the
client
for
his
work
in
the
case,
which
would
include
that
stuff--
unknown
speaker
--including
xeroxing.
unknown
speaker
well,
some
attorneys
bill
them
separately.
let's
assume
you
have...
just
as
some
attorneys
bill
paralegal
time
separately
and
some
don't.
you
can
either
bump
your
rate
up
or
you
can
show
it
separately.
but
let's
assume
that
an
attorney
shows
in
his
billing...
shows
travel
expenses
separately
as
many
do,
airfare...
i'm
not
sure
about
cab
fare,
but
airfare--
--and
as
they
did
in
this
case.
and
as
they
did
in
this
case.
you
wouldn't
consider
that
to
come
within
attorney's
fees?
unknown
speaker
and
not
anything
else
that's
necessary
for
him
to
do
his
part
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
answering
justice
scalia...
are
you
now
reading
the
statute
differently
than
when
you
answered
my
question?
what
about
xerox,
just
xerox
expenses,
long
distance
telephone,
travel
to
a
deposition?
those
are
not
taxable
as
costs
but
now
you're
saying
they
are
part
of
attorney's
fees.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the...
what
if
there's
a
normal
practice
in
a
particular
community?
the
lawyer
normally
hires
(a)
an
investigator,
(b)
an
expert
to
just
help
him
on
reading
forbes
documents,
say,
and
he
normally
bills
the
clients,
disbursement,
expert
to
help
reading
forbes
documents
and
that's
the
normal
practice
of
that
community.
does
he
recover
it
or
not
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
not
the
meaning
justice
scalia
has
described
to
us.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
his
suggestion
was
it
means
all
expenses
normally
charged
by
an
attorney
in
performing
the
routine
work
of
an
attorney
in
trying
a
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
can
i
reject
it,
too?
i
didn't
say
that.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
said,
normally
charged
by
an
attorney
for
his
work
in
the
suit.
if
it's
charged
for
somebody
else's
work...
i
mean,
and
that's
where
paralegals
are
different
because
that's
his
work.
he
can
do
it
himself
or
he
can
have
somebody
else
do
his
work
and
bill
that...
anyway,
so--
--but
i'm
still
not
sure--
--don't
include
me
in
your
condemnation.
[laughter]
i'm
still
not
clear
whether
long
distance
telephone,
travel,
and
depositions
and
so
forth
is
included
or
not,
or
a
secretary.
you
have
to
hire
a
secretary
to
do
work
late
at
night.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
thinking
of
items
that
are
not
overhead.
they're
work
that
is
especially
required
for
a
particular
piece
of
litigation,
which
lawyers
regularly
charge
and
they
list
in
their
disbursements
and
normally
get
them.
and
you
had
them
in
this
case,
$45,000
worth
that
you
didn't
challenge.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
challenge...
you
disagreed
as
to
certain
items
i
know,
but
you
didn't
challenge
the
general
principle.
unknown
speaker
mr.
koons,
maybe
you've
said
this...
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
expert
fees
that
do
not
result
in
expert
testimony
and
were
not
intended
to
result
in
expert
testimony.
let's
say
the
lawyer
consults
an
expert
to
find
out
something
about
the
case.
unknown
speaker
is
that
attorney's
fees?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
in
like
the
case
against
brown
against
the
board
of
education,
the
lawyers
decide
to
hire
some
historians
to
do
a
lot
of
research
on
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
so
forth,
strictly
to
help
them
prepare
their
brief.
attorney's
fees
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
koons,
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
in
missouri
v.
jenkins
to
the
effect
that
the
terms
reasonable
attorney's
fees
must
refer
to
a
reasonable
fee
for
the
work
product
of
an
attorney.
the
fee
must
take
into
account
the
work
not
only
of
attorneys
but
also
of
secretaries,
messengers,
librarians,
janitors,
and
others
whose
labor
contributes
to
the
work
product
for
which
an
attorney
bills
her
client.
unknown
speaker
well,
by
its
terms,
it's
not
so
limited,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well
you
just...
it's
just
wrong
to
say
that
1988
covers
all
reasonable
expenses
incurred
by
an
attorney
in
representing
a
civil
rights
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
koons.
mr.
adams,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
they...
that
they
were
the
regular
counsel
for
the
hospital,
regular
accountants
for
the
hospital
or
that--
unknown
speaker
--and
what
about
the
billing?
does
the
record
reflect
that
the
billing
went
directly
to
the
client?
unknown
speaker
mr.
koons,
this
is
also
true
in
the
antitrust
litigation.
do
you
know
what
the
practice
is
with
the
fee-shifting
provisions
of
the
antitrust
laws?
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
lot
of
experts
there
and
it's
been
a
fee-shifting
statute
that's
been
on
the
books
a
long
time.
but
you
don't
know
what
the
answer
is
there?
unknown
speaker
but...
you're
arguing
that,
you
know,
gee,
you
can't
have
an
attorney
without...
without
all
these
experts.
it
would
really
apply
across
the
board
to
every
other
kind
of
statute
as
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
it
thought...
you
know,
when
you
think
of
environmental
litigation,
you
think
of
experts
right
away.
when
you
think
of
civil
rights
cases,
as
i
think
civil
rights
cases
meant...
what
civil
rights
cases
meant
to
congress,
you
don't
as
automatically
think
of
expert
witnesses.
unknown
speaker
but
i
would...
you
would
then
be
making
the
same
argument
in...
on...
in
any
other
fee-shifting
statute
which
simply
said
the
prevailing
plaintiff
in
this
kind
of
a
case
is
entitled
to
recover
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
just
attorney's
fees.
i
thought
you
were
really
arguing
that
reasonable
expenses
that
were...
that...
that
are
necessary
for
the
attorney
to
represent
the
client
can
be
compensated
under
attorney's
fees.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you're
going...
if
we
don't...
if
we
don't
think
the
legislative
history
is
that
potent,
you
lose,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
adams.
unknown
speaker
somebody
that
works
with
you
2
years,
working
up
questions
and
answers
and
all,
and
that's
a
witness?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
used
any
other
experts
to
work
up
your
cases?
unknown
speaker
and
you
get
fees
for
that?
unknown
speaker
or
can
you
get
fees
for
only
testifying?
unknown
speaker
you
do?
unknown
speaker
i
just...
the
only
trouble...
i
said
what
is
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
it's
these
people
who
work
up
a
case
with
you,
and
i
would
consider
that
legal
work.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
call
one
of
your
lawyers
as
a
witness,
would
that
be
an
expert
witness?
