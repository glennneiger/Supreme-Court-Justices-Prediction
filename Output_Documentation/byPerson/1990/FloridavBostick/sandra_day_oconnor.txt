justice
o'connor
well,
general
starr,
is
the
cramped
setting
of
a
bus
that
is
about
to
leave
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances?
justice
o'connor
then,
mr.
ayer,
how
do
you
square
your
argument
with
what
this
court
held
in
the
delgado
case,
where
the
immigration
officers
had
basically
closed
off
the
doors
to
the
work
area
and
the
employees
were
not
free
to
leave
and
they
were
being
questioned?
it
seems
to
me,
faced
with
that
case,
that
you
have
kind
of
an
uphill
battle
here.
justice
o'connor
but
they
weren't
free
to
leave
it,
were
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
case,
89-1717
is
the
case
of
florida
versus
bostick.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
respondent,
terrence
bostick,
claims
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
when
police
searched
his
luggage
after
he
gave
them
consent
to
do
so.
at
the
time
the
search
took
place,
bostick
was
a
passenger
on
a
bus.
two
officers
boarded
the
bus
at
a
scheduled
stop,
asked
bostick
a
few
questions
and
then,
even
though
they
had
no
reason
to
suspect
bostick
of
a
crime,
the
officers
asked
whether
they
could
search
his
luggage.
the
officers
specifically
advised
bostick
that
he
had
the
right
to
refuse.
bostick
gave
the
officers
permission
to
search.
the
search
revealed
cocaine
and
bostick
was
arrested
and
prosecuted.
his
motion
to
suppress
the
cocaine
as
the
fruit
of
an
unlawful
seizure
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
and
the
state
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction.
the
florida
supreme
court
reversed
it,
however.
it
determined
that
bostick
had
been
unlawfully
seized
because
a
reasonable
passenger
would
not
have
felt
free
to
leave
the
bus
to
avoid
questioning
by
the
police.
we
understand
the
florida
supreme
court
who
have
established
a
per
se
rule
that
an
impermissible
seizure
inevitably
results
when
police
asks
questions
of
bus
passengers
in
the
absence
of
an
articulable
suspicion.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
and
remand.
the
florida
supreme
court
erred
in
adapting
a
per
se
rule
that
every
encounter
on
a
bus
is
a
seizure.
an
encounter
that
is
consensual
does
not
trigger
fourth
amendment
scrutiny.
our
cases,
applying
this
principle,
leave
no
doubt
that
the
police
may,
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment,
ask
questions
of
an
individual
even
though
the
police
have
no
articulable
suspicion
that
a
crime
has
been
committed,
and
they
may
request
consent
to
search
the
persons
luggage
so
long
as
the
officers
do
not
convey
a
message
that
compliance
with
their
request
is
required.
the
appropriate
test,
as
our
prior
cases
made
clear,
is
whether
taking
into
account
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
encounter,
a
reasonable
person
would
feel
free
to
decline
the
officers
request
or
otherwise
terminate
the
encounter.
that
the
encounter
took
place
in
the
cramped
confines
of
a
bus
is
one
relevant
factor
that
should
be
taken
into
account.
we
do
not
agree,
however,
with
the
florida
supreme
court
that
this
single
factor
is
dispositive
in
every
case.
the
facts
leave
some
doubt
whether
a
seizure
actually
occurred
in
this
case.
but
we
refrain
from
deciding
the
issue
ourselves
and
remand
it
so
the
florida
courts
may
evaluate
the
seizure
question
under
the
correct
legal
standard.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
balckmun
and
stevens
have
joined.
