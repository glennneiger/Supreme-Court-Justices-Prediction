mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
drug
interdiction
procedure
that
is
at
issue
here
is
a
natural
outgrowth
of
airline
interdiction
programs,
airport
interdiction
programs,
that
this
court
has
had
before
it
in
several
cases:
in
mendenhall,
in
florida
against
royer,
and
in
florida
against
rodriguez.
as
law
enforcement
efforts
at
airports
have
borne
fruit,
not
surprisingly,
drugs
have
been
transported,
in
the
experience
of
law
enforcement
officials
in
other
ways,
including
by
trains
and
by
bus.
this
tool,
which
was
employed
in
broward
county
is
a
tool
that
is
employed
increasingly
across
the
country.
it
is
used
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
other
jurisdictions.
it
is
carried
out
in
a
reasonable
and
professional
and
non-intimidating
way.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
only
unusual
in
the
sense
that
it
is
relatively
new.
broward
county
began
implementing
this
in
the
early
1980's.
this
jurisdiction
began
implementing
it
3
years
ago.
all
federal
courts
of
appeals
that
have
now
been
confronted
with
the
legality
of
this
have
unanimously
sustained
it.
no
dissents
whatever.
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
in
flowers,
in
particular,
speaking
the
fourth
circuit
speaking
through
judge
wilkinson
made,
i
think,
a
pivotal
point.
this
program
is
not
only
valuable
in
assuring
the
interdiction
of
drugs;
but
it
is
also
valuable
in
terms
of
depriving
individuals
of
dangerous
weapons.
that
is
one
aspect
of
this
program.
and
the
results
in
broward
county
are
quite
consistent
with
those
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
elsewhere.
not
only
are
drugs
seized,
but
weapons
are
seized
as
well;
45
dangerous
weapons
were
seized
by
broward
county
in
the
space
of
a
year
and
a
half.
in
terms
of
the
procedures
that
are
employed,
no,
i
don't
think
that
they
are
intimidating,
and
i
think
that
for
this
reason.
all
these
police
officers
engaged
in
this
program
are
trained.
they
have
read
this
court's
cases.
they
know
that
they
cannot
be
confrontational.
they
know
they
cannot
demand
cooperation.
they
know,
however,
under
this
court's
cases,
they
can
go
to
a
citizen
and
ask
for
that
citizen's
cooperation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
certainly
might
have
been.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
those
who
began
the
firing,
i
would
think.
justice
marshall,
let
me
give
you
this
assurance:
not
only
is
this
record
barren
of
any
indication
of
such
a
problem,
it
is
our
experience
that
there
is
no
such
problem.
there
have
been
no
such
incidents
to
our
knowledge
of
shoot-outs
on
buses.
individuals
cooperate.
and
why
do
they
cooperate?
this
court,
by
the
way,
has
in
schneckloth
and
in
mendenhall
and
in
delgado,
said,
it
is
irrelevant
whether
you
have
been
told
whether
you
are
free
to
cooperate
or
not.
the
point
is,
this
is
a
free
society.
you
have
the
right
to
say
no.
this
court
has
had
cases
before
it
in
which
individuals
have
asserted
that
right.
they
have
said
no.
brown
against
texas,
the
police
offices
come
to
the
individual
and
he
says,
i
am
not
going
to
cooperate.
at
that
point,
the
police
officers
in
this
program
are
trained
to
back
off.
whether
they
must,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
is
a
different
matter
in
terms
of
fourth
amendment
analysis,
because
the
critical
fourth
amendment
inquiry
is
whether,
as
general
fowler
put
it,
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
there
has
been
a
show
of
force,
a
display
of
force
or
a
show
of
authority
so
as
to
restrain
the
individual.
i
have
no
problem
at
all
with
the
concept
that
justice
souter
suggested
of
detention.
the
police
officers
station
themselves
in
this
kind
of
encounter
so
that
there
is
no
detention.
the
person
is
physically
free
to
get
up
and
absent
himself,
not
necessarily
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
but
because
of
the
cramped
setting,
law
enforcement
officers
are
trained
not
to
block
the
individual's
right
of
access
to
the
aisle
or
wherever
the
individual
wants
to
go.
the
individual
need
not
leave
the
bus.
the
individual
can
simply
say
no,
and
remain
precisely
where
he
is
or
he
can
simply
move
to
another
seat.
he
can
vote
with
his
feet,
but
he
does
not
have
to
take
the
extraordinary
action--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
agree,
justice
white,
if
i
may.
i
don't
think
that
question
is
presented
in
this
case.
because
as
i
read
this
record,
florida
has
not
preserved
that
point.
has
not
preserved
the
point
of
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
diminution
of
the
taint
so
that
this
is
not
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
in
the
ordinary
case,
that
would
be
presented.
the
way
this
case
has
come
narrowly
to
the
court
is
whether
the
very
act
of
approaching
a
citizen
on
a
bus
and
asking
for
the
individual's
identification,
bus
ticket
and
the
like,
constitutes
a
seizure.
because
florida,
i
think
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--by
virtue
of
what
the
florida
supreme
court
has
determined,
erroneously
in
our
judgment,
to
have
been
an
illegal
seizure,
we
believe
there
was
not
a
fourth
amendment
event
here,
by
virtue
of
the
cooperation
of
this
individual--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
was
the
theory
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
and
what
florida
has
presented
to
this
court
in
the
question
presented
is
the
proposition
that
there
was
no
seizure
here,
and
we
think
that
that
is
exactly
right,
as
three
court
of
appeals
have
now
unanimously
concluded.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
absolutely
right.
this
court
has
said
so
in
schneckloth
v.
bustamonte.
it
said
it
in
mendenhall
and
it
said
it
in
delgado.
i
think
that
is
settled
law.
i
thank
the
court.
