ms.
fowler,
backing
up
a
little,
why
did
they
go
straight
to
the
back
of
the
bus?
justice
marshall
well,
why
didn't
they
start
in
the
front?
justice
marshall
they
had
some
reason,
didn't
they?
justice
marshall
wouldn't
it
appear
that
they
had
a
reason,
to
start
at
the
back
instead
of
the
front?
justice
marshall
how
do
you
know
what
the
drug
dealers
do?
justice
marshall
and
it
is
always
interesting
to
me
that
all
of
the
drug
pushers,
when
you
ask
to
search
them,
they
say,
oh,
come
on.
if
looks
like
usual
people
don't
do
that.
why
is
it
that
the
guys
who
plead
guilty...
why
do
dope
pushers
plead
guilty?
justice
marshall
no,
no.
i
mean,
when
i
have
got
dope
on
me,
and
i
say
search
me,
am
i
not
pleading
guilty?
justice
marshall
that
is
right.
why?
can
you
give
me
a
reason
why?
justice
marshall
they
are
just
good
people.
justice
marshall
they
are
just
good
people?
justice
marshall
general
starr?
justice
marshall
if
there
had
been
a
shooting
match
on
that
bus,
there
would
have
been
a
whole
lot
of
people
killed,
wouldn't
there?
justice
marshall
and
who
would
have
been
responsible
for
it?
