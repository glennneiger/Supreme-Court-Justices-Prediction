how
do
we
know
that?
how
does
he
know
what
would
have
happened
at
the
next
bus
stop?
justice
stevens
would
the
fact
that
he
said
no
in
ftlauderdale
give
probable,
reasonable
suspicion
to
an
officer
in
palm
beach
to
say,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
the
same
questions--
justice
stevens
--there
is
no
communication
between
different
branches
of
the
different
police
departments?
justice
stevens
i
thought
one
of
the
opinions
referred
to
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
would
it
be
consistent
with
your
position
for
the
police
to
call
ahead
to
the
next
city
where
the
bus
comes
in,
and
suggest
to
them
that
without
basing
any
reasonable
suspicion,
that
they
just
reinterrogate
the
same
person?
would
there
be
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
stevens
well,
the
fact
that
he...
unlike
so
many
thousands
of
people
who
are
willing
to
let
their
bags
be
searched,
unlike
so
many,
he
just
wouldn't
let
them
search
his
bag.
i
gather
from
the
history
of
this,
that
most
people
are
willing
to
allow
their
bags
to
be
searched.
justice
stevens
problems
they
are
not
aware
of
until
the
officer
has
confronted
them
on
the
bus,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
it
is
the
reasonable
dope
dealer
we
are
talking
about.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
but
as
justice
marshall
points
out,
the
cases
always
are
people
who
are
not
reasonable
citizens.
may
i
just
ask
on
the
standard
practice.
is
it
standard
practice
to
search
as
many
bags
as
possible
during
the
stop
at
the--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
how
many
did
they
search?
justice

general
starr,
would
you
comment,
in
view
of
that
argument,
on
the
statement
in
the
brief
amicus
for
the
americans
for
effective
law
enforcement,
professor
envow's
group,
which
has
uniformly
supported
the
government
in
all
of
these
cases.
it
says,
"amicus,
with
more
than
16
years
experience
in
police
training
and
education,
view
the
confrontation
and
search
procedure
used
here
as
highly
unusual,
if
not
unique.
"
do
you
think
he
is
wrong?
