chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-1717,
florida
v.
terrance
bostick.
ms.
fowler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
supposing,
ms.
fowler,
that
the
bus
has
an
accident
on
the
highway
between
ftlauderdale
and
palm
beach
and
the
sheriff
comes
and
says,
i
want
to
investigate
the
accident.
please
hold
up
the
bus
for
an
hour
while
we...
i
want
to
interview
the
driver.
i
want
to
take
some
photographs.
do
you
think
the
people
on
the
bus
are
seized
because
of
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
msfowler.
general
starr,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
mr.
ayer,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
it
be
objectionable,
mr.
ayer,
if
on
a
uniformed
police
with
a
gun
in
his
shoulder
holster
or
side
holster
did
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
think
a
reasonable
person
might
have
concluded
that
if
he
didn't
consent,
the
officer
would
shoot
him.
is
that
what
you
are
trying
to
say?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
a
likely
conclusion
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
judge
lett's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
district
court
of
appeals,
he
says
that
there
is
conflict
in
the
evidence
about
whether
the
defendant
consented
to
the
search
of
the
second
bag,
and
whether
he
was
informed
of
his
right
to
refuse
consent.
however,
any
conflict
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
state,
it
being
a
question
of
fact,
decided
by
the
trial
judge.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
florida
supreme
court
assumed
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
he
was
advised
of
his
right
to
refuse
consent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
b1--
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
if
a
person
is
asleep?
is
there
some
one
way,
according
to
you,
that
the
officers
could
constitutionally
get
his
attention?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
it
have
been
preferable
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
in
your
view
if
the
police
had
simply
admonished
him
to
wake
up
in
a
loud
voice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
how...
then
in
your
view,
how,
consistently
with
the
fourth
amendment,
should
a
police
officer
who
wishes
to
interrogate
a
sleeping
passenger
on
a
bus
go
about
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can't--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you
say
a
lot
about
things
that
are
not
a
per
se
bar,
but
apparently
a
lot
of
things
are
factored
in.
but
when
we
get
down
to
brass
tacks
on
this,
i
get
the
impression
you
think
there
really
is
no
way
that
they
can
properly
wake
him
up
without
having
it
counted
against
him
in
this
calculus
that
you
are
putting
together?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
can't
say,
would
you
agree
to
wake
up?
the
person
can't
say
no.
if
you
wake
him,
you
wake
him
up.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
ayer.
ms.
fowler,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
are
a
little
bit
in
the
dark
about
some
of
the
facts,
are
we
not,
ms.
fowler?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
view
of
the...
the
trial
court
did
not
make
specific
findings.
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
quotes
from
judge
letts'
dissent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
fowler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
