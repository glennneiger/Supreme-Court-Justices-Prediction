justice
scalia
why
do
you
say
it
would
have
been
a
seizure
if
the
officer
continued
to
question
him?
i
mean,
let's
assume
i
am
walking
down
the
street
and
an
officer
comes
up
to
me
and
just
walks
alongside
and
he
starts
asking
me
questions.
and
i
say,
officer,
you
know,
i
would
really
rather
not
talk
to
you.
he
just
keeps
walking
along
side
and
keeps
asking
the
questions,
and
i
don't
answer.
i
have
been
seized?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
see
how
maybe,
you
know,
he
would
be
guilty
of
harassment
or
something,
but
how
it
is
a
seizure?
justice
scalia
he
just
talks
to
me
when
i
don't
want
to
be
talked
to.
a
lot
of
people
do
that
to
me
sometimes,
i
never
think--
[laughter]
i
never
think
i
have
been
seized.
i
really
don't.
justice
scalia
and
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
leave
you
alone.
he
just
keeps
walking
along
side.
but
he
is
not
stopping
me.
he
just
keeps
talking
in
my
ear.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
have
been
annoyed,
but
i
haven't
been
seized.
justice
scalia
why
would
it
then...
are
you
urging
a
"no
harm
in
asking"
rule?
i
mean,
do
you
need
probable
cause
or
anything
just
to
come
up
and
say,
do
you
mind
if
i
search
your
bag?
justice
scalia
so
why
would
there
be--
justice
scalia
--why
would
there
be
any
question
about
calling
ahead?
if
you
say
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
law
involved
in
simply
asking
somebody.
justice
scalia
well,
that
could
be
police
harassment,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i
would
assume.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
consistently,
with
the
rest
of
your
case.
justice
scalia
they
may
not
be
a
very
bright
bunch
of
people
perhaps.
justice
scalia
which
is
a
good
thing,
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
general
starr,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
you
think
it
is
irrelevant
to
this
case
that
officer...
not
irrelevant,
but
unnecessary
at
least
to
the
case,
that
officer
rubino
advised
mr.
bostick
that
you
have
the
right
to
refuse?
as
far
as
you
are
concerned,
he
didn't
have
to
say
that?
justice
scalia
why
is
that
critical?
most
police
officers
i
see
are
bearing
sidearms.
i
don't
know
why
you
think
that
that
is
so
extraordinary.
justice
scalia
the
gun
was
in
a
pouch,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
scalia
but
how
else
would
he
have
carried
the
gun?
i
mean,
he
wasn't
in
uniform,
so
he
didn't
have
a
holster
on
his
side.
you
usually
don't
see
them
when
they
are
wearing
these
jackets
with
a
sam
brown
belt
on
it.
justice
scalia
well,
now,
wait.
not
all
the
factors
that
would
restrict
one.
i
assume
when
you
say
that
the
reasonable
person
would
think
he
is
not
free
to
leave,
you
mean,
he
is
not
free
to
leave
because
of
the
assertion
of
state
authority
against
him,
right,
either
force
or
the
threat
of
restraint?
justice
scalia
so
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
a
lot
of
trouble
to
leave,
that
he
would
have
to
take
his
baggage
out
of
the
baggage
compartment
of
the
bus;
that
he
would
have
to
chuck
away
half
of
his
ticket,
all
of
that
is
irrelevant
to
whether
he
thought
that
force
was
being
applied
against
him
to
prevent
his
leaving?
you
acknowledge
that
those
circumstances
are
irrelevant?
justice
scalia
but,
mr.
ayer,
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
we
don't
know
in
this
case
that
he
was
asleep.
justice
scalia
and
we
don't
know
that
he
was
touched
on
the
foot.
justice
scalia
well,
what
are
we
talking
about
it
for?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
it
is
a
factor
that
we
don't
know
existed
in
this
case.
so
how
can
we
factor
it
in
when
we
are
not
sure
it
was
there.
justice
scalia
we
are
going
to
determine
whether
he
was
touched
on
the
foot?
justice
scalia
mr.
ayer,
the
problem
is
even
worse
than
that.
as
i
understand
the
supreme
court
of
florida
opinion,
all
of
those
facts
were
ultimately
irrelevant.
it
answered,
it
rephrased
the
certified
question
which
was
very
general
and
contained
no
facts
in
it.
and
i
gather
the
basis
for
its
ruling
was
on
a1
of
your
appendix:
"does
an
impermissible
seizure
result
when
police
mount
a
drug
search
on
buses
during
scheduled
stops
and
question
boarded
passengers
without
articulable
reasons
for
doing
so,
thereby
obtaining
consent
to
search
the
passenger's
luggage.
"
there
are
no
details
in
that
at
all.
i
take
that
to
be
the
basis
for
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
holding.
justice
scalia
well,
i
gather
that
it
was
irrelevant
to
the
florida
supreme
court
what
the
facts
were,
so
long
as
the
situation
came
within
that
rephrased
question,
they
were
going
to
find
for
the
defendant.
justice
scalia
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
they
refer
back
again,
the
very
last
paragraph:
"for
the
foregoing
reasons,
we
answer
the
certified
question,
as
rephrased,
in
the
affirmative.
"
they
decided
this
on
the
basis
of
a
rule
of
law
that
you
can't
have
bus
searches.
justice
scalia
mr.
ayer,
i
thought
you
said
earlier,
i
thought
you
acknowledged
earlier
that
it
is
not
the
confinement;
it
is
only
the
confinement
by
reason
of
authority,
so
that
the
mere
fact
that
you
are
on
a
bus
or
anymore
than
the
fact
that
you
are
on
an
elevator
doesn't
make
it
an
arrest.
so
to
be
sure,
he
may
only
be
able
to
move
three
seats
away,
but
so
long
as
he
can
move
three
seats
away
and
there
is
no
force
or
threat
of
force
that
prevents
him
from
moving
that
distance
or
further,
i
don't
see
why
it
is
an
arrest,
why
it
is
a
seizure.
justice
scalia
oh,
no.
if
the
officer
is
blocking
the
way
out,
that
is
restricting
his
movement
by
force
or
threat
of
force.
but
if
an
officer
in
an
elevator,
the
man
standing
in
an
elevator,
the
officer
begins
a
conversation
with
him.
now
he
can't
move
very
far
in
the
elevator.
has
he
been
seized?
i
would
think
you
would
say
no
because
it
has
to
be...
the
reason
he
can't
move
has
to
be
the
assertion
of
authority
over
him.
justice
scalia
that
is
a
good
point.
i
am
not
questioning
that
point
of
your
argument.
i
am
just
questioning
the
part
of
your
argument
that
says
he
couldn't
go
far,
he
could
only
move
two
or
three
seats
away.
that
seems
to
me
irrelevant.
