justice
kennedy
have
we
ever
said
in
our
cases
that
the
exercise
of
your
rights
is
grounds
for
additional
suspicion
on
the
part
of
officers?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
are
not.
because
you
responded
to
justice
stevens,
that
this
would
not
be
grounds
for
giving
added
suspicion
to
either
these
police
or
to
police
in
another
jurisdiction.
so
i
think
that
is
consistent
with
your
answer.
justice
kennedy
was
there
any
showing
that
the
bus
departure
was
delayed?
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
police
did
delay
the
bus
20
minutes
in
order
to
conduct
this
sort
of
investigation,
would
that
have
any
bearing
on
the
case
or
would
it
change
the
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
police
delay
the
bus
for
an
hour
and
a
half,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
there
is
a
seizure?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
they
are
conducting
this
investigation
that
was
conducted
here,
but
it
took
them
an
hour
and
a
half?
and
they
ask
the
bus
to
please
cooperate,
the
driver
to
please
cooperate
by
waiting
until
they
got
there
and
they
took
their
time
to
get
there.
they
delay
it
for
an
hour
and
a
half
for
this
investigation.
justice
kennedy
well,
it
is
the
same
facts
as
you
have
here.
justice
kennedy
but
isn't
the
fact
is,
the
reason
he
didn't
want
to
leave
is
he
didn't
want
to
get
off
the
bus,
not
because
he
didn't
want
to
talk
to
the
officers
necessarily.
justice
kennedy
well,
the
reason
we
don't
know
it
is
because
your
client
didn't
exercise
his
rights.
if
he
had,
then
we
would
have
found
out
the
answer.
