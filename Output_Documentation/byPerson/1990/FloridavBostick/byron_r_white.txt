justice
white
did
they
explain
what
their
mission
was?
justice
white
and
is
it
also
unclear
whether
they
told
the
person
that
he
need
not
consent?
justice
white
is
that
clear
or
is
that
disputed?
justice
white
so
we
may
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
he
was
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
refuse?
justice
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
white
but
he
could
have...
you
think
it
is
clear
enough
that
we
judge
the
case
on
the
basis
that
he
was
told
that
he
could
refuse
the
search?
justice
white
whether
the
consent
it
tainted,
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
he
can
leave,
is
it?
or
isn't
it
whether
or
not
he--
justice
white
--whether
his
will
was
overborne
by
this
show
of
authority
when
he
consented?
justice
white
rather
that
whether
that
constitutes
such
a
threat
that
his
consent
should
be
held
invalid.
i
thought
the
whole
thing
was
that
the
consent
was
invalid?
justice
white
the
consent
was
invalid
because
it
was
a
product
of
an
illegal
seizure,
is
that
correct?
justice
white
but
he
was
told
that
he
need
not
consent?
justice
white
wasn't
there
any
finding
at
all?
justice
white
--in
their
theory,
whether
he
was
advised
or
not
was
irrelevant.
justice
white
why
shouldn't
we
be
satisfied
or
why
shouldn't
you
be
satisfied
with
our
deciding
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
which
the
supreme
court
of
florida
recited
as
being
the
facts
of
the
case?
justice
white
so
we
don't
know
whether
he...
on
a2
they
say
the
facts
in
this
case
are
succinctly
stated
by
judge
letts
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
is
that
good
enough
for
you?
justice
white
and
so
the
evidence
disputed
about
whether
the
defendant
consented
or
whether
he
was
informed
of
his
right,
but
the
conflict
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
state--
justice
white
--that
we
don't
know
whether...
on
these
facts,
you
don't
know
whether
they
touched
the
man
at
all.
justice
white
if
we
understood
the
supreme
court
of
florida
as
saying
that
in
no
case,
under
no
circumstances
may
police
board
a
bus
and
inquire
from
passengers
about
their
luggage,
you
would
not
defend
that
rule?
justice
white
you
say
you
are
not
asking
for
it?
justice
white
and
furthermore,
would
you
defend
it
if
we
understood
that
to
be
the
rule?
justice
white
well,
give
me
the
circumstances
under
which
police
may
board
the
bus
and
ask
a
customer
or
a
passenger,
may
we
search
your
luggage?
justice
white
if
a
small
person,
that
couldn't
block
the
aisle--
justice
white
--so
if
they
say,
don't
get
us
wrong,
you
are
quite
free
to
leave
the
bus.
of
course,
you
may
not
get
to
ftlauderdale,
but
you
are
quite
free
to
leave.
justice
white
and
if
the
florida
supreme
court
would
not
accept
that,
you
think
it
is
wrong?
justice
white
i
take
it,
you
think
that
the
florida
supreme
court
based
its
ruling
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case:
the
fact
of
the
gun,
the
fact
of
blocking
the
aisle.
whereas,
if
those
facts
hadn't
been
present,
they
would
have
had
a
different
view?
justice
white
justice
scalia,
please.
