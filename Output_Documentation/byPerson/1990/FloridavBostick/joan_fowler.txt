ms.
joan
fowler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
terrance
bostick
was
reclining
on
the
rear-most
seat
in
a
greyhound
bus
when
he
was
approached
by
officer
nutt.
office
nutt
spoke
to
mr.
bostick
in
a
conversational
tone.
he
asked
mr.
bostick
where
he
was
traveling
to.
mr.
bostick
replied
that
he
was
going
to
atlanta.
mr.
nutt
asked
mr.
bostick
for
his
identification
and
for
his
bus
ticket.
those
were
reviewed
by
the
officer
and
quickly
returned
to
mr.
bostick.
mr.
bostick
was
then
asked
if
he
would
be
willing
to
cooperate
with
the
police
by
allowing
a
search
of
his
bag.
mr.
bostick
agreed
to
the
consent,
excuse
me,
consented
to
a
search
of
the
red
bag
upon
which
he
was
reclining.
as
it
turned
out,
that
bag
did
not
belong
to
him.
it
did
not
reveal
any
contraband.
there
was
a
blue
suit
bag
in
the
overhead
rack
above
mr.
bostick.
when
mr.
bostick
was
asked
whether
or
not
it
was
his
bag
he
said
that
it
was.
he
was
asked
again
whether
or
not
he
would
consent
to
the
search,
and
he
consented
to
the
search
of
that
bag
which
revealed
over
400
grams
of
cocaine.
mr.
bostick
was
subsequently
arrested.
it
is
the
position
of--
ms.
joan
fowler
--it
is
unclear
from
this
record
as
to
whether
or
not
they
went
through
what
is
usually
gone
through,
which
is
saying
that
we
have
a
drug
problem
in
south
florida.
it
is
very
serious.
we
are
asking
the
cooperation
of
citizens.
it
is
not
clear
from
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
in
this
case
if
that
was
said
to
mr.
bostick.
ms.
joan
fowler
officer
nutt
told
mr.
bostick
at
the
time
that
he
requested
the
consent
for
the
search
of
the
blue
bag
that
he
had
the
right
to
refuse.
ms.
joan
fowler
i
don't
believe
that
is
in
dispute,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
fowler
right
to
refuse
the
search.
he
was
not
told
that
he
had
a
right
not
to
talk
with
the
officers.
ms.
joan
fowler
but
the
encounter
between
mr.--
ms.
joan
fowler
--yes,
absolutely.
these
officers
were
wearing
plain
clothes
covered
with
a
windbreaker
which
had
a
sheriff's
department
insignia
on
the
shoulders.
it
also
said
sheriff's
department
across
the
back.
other
than
that,
they
were
wearing
normal
clothing
as
any
other
citizen
would
do.
officer
rubino
had
his
firearm
in
the
waistband
of
his
pants.
it
was
not
readily
visible.
officer
nutt
had
his
gun
in
a
pouch
which
was
held
in
his
hand.
we
do
not
know
exactly
where
that
pouch
was
at
any
given
time
during
this
encounter.
mr.
bostick,
since
he
was
in
the
rear-most
seat
of
the
bus,
officer
nutt
and
officer
rubino
were
in
the
seats
in
front
of
his,
sort
of
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
aisle.
there
was
still
sufficient
room
for
mr.
bostick
to
have
gotten
up
and
left
the
bus,
had
he
so
chosen.
but
the
state
would
urge
that
that
is
not
the
test,
that--
ms.
joan
fowler
--that
is
correct.
that
is
possible
that
that
would
happen.
but
i
believe
that
a
more
correct
test
under
these
circumstances
is
whether
or
not
mr.
bostick
was
free
to
terminate
the
encounter,
whether
or
not
he
could
have
merely
told
the
officers
that
he
was
not
interested
in
talking
to
them.
if
he
had
done
so,
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter
and
the
officers
would
have
gone
on,
either
to
other
passengers
or
gotten
off
the
bus
if
they
did
not
get
any
cooperation
from
any
other
passengers.
ms.
joan
fowler
justice
souter,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that,
it
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
restraint
of
mr.
bostick's
liberties,
so
as
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
seizure.
ms.
joan
fowler
if
the
verbal
conversation
had
ended,
the
officers
would
have
moved
on.
if
they
had
not
moved
on
then...
if
mr.
bostick
had
said,
officer
nutt,
i
do
not
want
to
talk
to
you,
i
want
to
go
to
sleep,
and
then
officer
nutt
had
gone
further,
then
that
probably
would
have
given
rise
to
a
seizure.
but
if
he
had
said,
no,
and
the
officers
had
moved
on,
that
is
what
we
assume
would
have
occurred.
ms.
joan
fowler
yes.
ms.
joan
fowler
we
have,
i
believe,
the
officer's
testimony
which
is
that
he
would
have
moved
on.
ms.
joan
fowler
at
some
point
that
may
have
given
rise
to
a
seizure.
it
depends
upon
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
ms.
joan
fowler
i
am
not--
ms.
joan
fowler
--no.
it
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
encounter
and
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
if
you
have
turned
around
to
an
officer
and
said,
you
know,
leave
me
alone.
absolutely,
i
do
not
want
to
talk
to
you.
ms.
joan
fowler
if
you
are
free
to
go
about
your
business,
you
haven't
been
seized.
and
in
this
case,
mr.
bostick--
ms.
joan
fowler
--right.
and
in
this
case,
mr.
bostick's
business
was
staying
on
his
bus
and
going
to
his
final
destination.
so
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
officers
prevented
him
from
doing
exactly
that.
and
all
he
had
to
do
was
literally
say
no
to
the
officers,
and
if
he
had
said
no,
then
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
encounter.
ms.
joan
fowler
we
don't
know
for
certain
what
would
happen.
but
we
can
only
assume.
ms.
joan
fowler
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
an
isolated
incident.
what
occurred--
ms.
joan
fowler
--there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
and
there
is
nothing
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
joan
fowler
there
is
some
language
in
one
of
the
d.c.
opinions
that
says
that
the
officer
had
said
that.
but
the
opinion
also
goes
on
to
say
that
they
treat
that
as
irrelevant:
what
the
subjective
thoughts
of
the
officer
were.
they
do
not
use
that
as
part
of
their
holding.
and
in
this
case,
we
need
to
decide
what
a
reasonable
person
in
mr.
bostick's
circumstances
would
have
thought
when
two
people
in
plain
clothes
came,
actually
one
person
came
up
to
talk
to
him,
the
other
officer
was
further
up
in
the
bus.
ms.
joan
fowler
no,
we
have
not.
pardon
me,
no,
you
have
not.
this
court
has
not
so
held.
and
we
are
not
saying
that
here
today.
what
we
are
saying
is
that--
ms.
joan
fowler
--yes,
sir.
ms.
joan
fowler
i
am
not
sure
that
they
would
have
a
basis
for
doing
that.
ms.
joan
fowler
right.
what
we
have
learned
is
that
most
people
feel
a
moral
compulsion
to
cooperate
with
police
officers,
especially
when
they
are
informed
about
the
problems
that
we
have
with
drugs.
i
just--
ms.
joan
fowler
--or
they
may
well
be
aware
of
them
because
it
is
all
over
the
media.
it
is
all
over,
you
know,
people
have...
they
know
of
people
in
the
community
that
have
problems.
i
mean,
it
is
common
knowledge
that
drugs
are
a
very
serious
problem
in
this
country.
so
i
don't
think
that
most
people,
when
they
are
approached
by
officers,
that
that
is
the
first
time
that
they
have
heard
about
a
drug
problem,
but
that
might
give
rise
to
why
they
are
more
likely
to
cooperate.
i
really
can't
give
you
a
yes
or
no
answer
as
to
whether
or
not
calling
ahead
would
be
proper.
ms.
joan
fowler
no.
you
don't
need
probable
cause.
ms.
joan
fowler
that
is
merely
a
citizen
encounter.
ms.
joan
fowler
right.
i
just
have
a
concern
that
if
you
do
this,
you
know,
25
times,
that
might
be
a
problem.
and
that
that
question
is
not--
ms.
joan
fowler
--okay.
that
is
correct.
ms.
joan
fowler
correct.
thank
you,
your
honor.
what
we
need
to
look
here,
is
to
whether
or
not
the
actions
of
the
officers,
the
totality
of
their
actions
were
reasonable
and
whether
or
not
they
caused
a
restraint
of
liberty
of
mr.
bostick.
florida
asserts
that
there
was
no
restraint
of
his
liberty.
there
was
no
show
of
force.
there
was
no
display
of
a
weapon.
there
was
no
display
of
authority.
in
any--
ms.
joan
fowler
--in
the
bus
driver's
deposition
he
stated
that
they
left
20
minutes
late.
however,
it
is
unclear
as
to
whether
that
was
a
direct
result
of
mr.
bostick's
arrest.
ms.
joan
fowler
i
don't
think
it
would.
i
think
that
that
would
be
between
the
bus
company
and
the
police
officers,
as
long
as--
ms.
joan
fowler
--i
think
you
have
to
look
to
what
they
are
doing
with
each
individual
person
on
the
bus.
ms.
joan
fowler
are
you
saying
this
investigation
with
mr.
bostick
alone
or
with
everyone
on
the
bus?
ms.
joan
fowler
i
think
that
that
is
a
factor
that
should
be
considered,
but
it
does
not
necessarily
give
rise
to
a
seizure.
what
we
are
saying
here,
and
where
we
are
saying
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
erred
is
in
not
considering
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
ms.
joan
fowler
no,
because
that
is
regular
police
business.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
problem
at
all
with
that.
and
i
am
not
saying
that
they
were
seized
under
the
other
scenario.
i
am
saying
it
is
a
factor
to
be
considered.
and
if
there
is
an
accident,
clearly
the
police
are
within
their
rights
to
do
whatever
investigation
is
required.
ms.
joan
fowler
what
we
have
learned
from
the
officers
is
that
they
try
to
approach
as
many
people
on
the
bus
as
they
can
within
the
time
allotted
to
them.
and
so
it
is
easier--
ms.
joan
fowler
--their
practice
is
to
start
in
the
back
because
then
when
they
get
to
the
front
they
can
exit
the
vehicle.
ms.
joan
fowler
pardon
me?
ms.
joan
fowler
i
think
that
the
reason,
the
only
reason
that
i
have
been
given
is
that
it
is
just
their
standard
practice
because
they
do
exit
the
vehicle
when
they
get
to
the
front
of
the
bus.
otherwise,
they
would
go
to
the
front,
to
the
back
and
then
have
to
leave
again.
also,
there
is
evidence,
not
in
this
record,
but
in
other
cases,
that
drug
dealers
prefer
to
be
in
the
back
of
the
bus
because
they
have
more...
they
are
more
concealed.
and
that
is
something
that--
ms.
joan
fowler
--that
is
something
that
police
officers
have
told
me.
but
that
is
not
clear
in
this
record.
ms.
joan
fowler
because
they
are
guilty.
if
you
are
asking
why
they
plead
guilty
after
they
have
been,
after
there
is
probable
cause
for
arrest--
ms.
joan
fowler
--you
are
cooperating
with
the
police
officers.
ms.
joan
fowler
i
think
a
reasonable
person
would
do
it--
ms.
joan
fowler
--because
they
are
trying
to
be
cooperative.
ms.
joan
fowler
yes.
ms.
joan
fowler
but
the
test
that
we
need
to
be
looking
at
is
that
of
a
reasonable
citizen.
what
would
a
reasonable
citizen--
ms.
joan
fowler
--it
is
standard
practice
to
approach
as
many
people
and
request
consent
for
the
search
of
the
bags
as
possible.
ms.
joan
fowler
on
this
bag,
excuse
me,
on
this
bus
they
never
got
past
mr.
bostick.
because
once
they
arrested
him
it
was
time
for
the
bus
to
move
on.
i
think,
justice
marshall,
in
response
to
your
question,
i
am
sure
there
are
a
lot
of
drug
dealers
who
do
say
no,
and
we
just
never
see
those
cases.
so
it
is
not
as
if
every
drug
dealer
is
saying,
is
agreeing
to
this
for
some
reason.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
ms.
joan
fowler
--yes,
that
is
probably
very
true.
ms.
joan
fowler
yes,
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
joan
fowler
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reemphasize
the
fact
that
these
officers
spoke
to
mr.
bostick
in
normal
conversational
tones.
they
at
no
time
raised
their
voices.
the
gun
was
not
drawn
at
any
time.
it
was
kept
within
the
pouch.
all
people
in
america
know
that
police
officers
carry
weapons.
they
may
not
know
where
they
are
being
holstered--
ms.
joan
fowler
--no,
justice
white.
i
think
that
you
are
correct
in
saying
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
held
a--
ms.
joan
fowler
--i
am
sorry,
justice
scalia.
that
there
was
the
per
se
rule
that
under
no
circumstances
can
police
go
on
buses
to
discuss
with
citizens,
to
ask
their
cooperation
for
a
search
for
any
type
of
contraband.
and
we
are
saying
here
today
that
that
bright
line
rule,
that
test
should
not
be
the
test.
also,
we
are
saying
that
under
the
specific
facts
of
bostick,
that
there
was
no
show
of
authority
sufficient
to
restrain
his
liberty,
so
as
to
implicate
the
fourth
amendment.
the
aisle
was
not
blocked.
mr.
bostick's
counsel
has
gotten
up
here
and
repeatedly
said
that
the
aisle
was
blocked.
it
was
partially
blocked.
mr.
bostick
could
still
have
gotten
past--
ms.
joan
fowler
--yes,
we
are.
ms.
joan
fowler
that
is
correct.
we
would
ask
that
this
court
look
at
those
facts
that
are
set
forth
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
which
is
in
our
petition
for
cert
at
a2.
ms.
joan
fowler
yes.
those
facts
are
sufficient,
i
think
for
this
court
to
make
a
ruling.
therefore,
we
don't
have
to
get
into
any
questions
about
whether
or
not
he
was
sleeping,
and
there
is
evidence
that
he
was
not.
just
because
the
door
to
this
bus
was
closed
does
not
mean
that
the
defendant
could
not
have
gotten
off
the
bus.
it
could
have
still
be
opened.
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
was
locked.
that
would
be
a
fire
hazard
or
something.
ms.
joan
fowler
my
understanding
is,
all
you
have
to
do
is
push
it.
there
is
no
specific
levers
or
anything
like
that.
a
mere
pushing
is
sufficient.
and
under
delgado,
this
court
has
found
that
it
is
not
a
test
of
whether
or
not
you
are
free
to
leave,
it
is
whether
or
not
you
are
free
to
go
about
your
business.
and
mr.
bostick's
business
was
staying
on
the
bus
to
continue
his
travels,
and
he
did
not
have
to
talk
to
these
officers
if
he
did
not
want
to.
thank
you.
