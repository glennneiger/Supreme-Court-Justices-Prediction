justice
souter
does
that
beg
the
question?
because
you
say
he
could
have
ended
the
encounter.
he
could
have
ended
the
conversation
to
the
extent
that
it
was
a
two-way
conversation,
but
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
detention.
and
the
police
officer
would
still
be
there
and
unless
he
wanted
to
get
off
the
bus
and
be
left
behind,
he
would
still
be
there.
so
isn't
the
question
not
whether
an
encounter
could
be,
in
the
sense
of
the
conversation
could
be
ended,
but
whether
there
was
a
detention
and
whether
that
could
be
ended?
justice
souter
and
that
isn't,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
not
synonymous
with
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
conversation,
the
verbal
interaction
between
them
could
have
been
ended,
is
it?
justice
souter
well,
yes,
if.
i
mean,
that
is
the
assumption
that
we
have
to
make
for
your
argument
to
work.
isn't
it?
justice
souter
and
we
don't
have
anything
to
go
on
but
assumption,
do
we?
