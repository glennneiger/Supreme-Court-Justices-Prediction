mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
note
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
indicates
anything
about
the
training
of
the
officers
or
the
procedures
that
they
were
instructed
to
follow.
there
is
material
in
later
cases,
indeed
cases
out
of
broward
county
indicating
in
later
years,
not
in
1985,
when
this
case
occurred,
but
in
later
years
following
this
case
and
others,
that
they
did
in
fact
adopt
certain
procedures
which
included
standing
behind
the
seat
rather
than
in
front
of
it;
not
displaying
weapons;
and
a
number
of
other
safeguards
which
indeed
are
not
present
here.
so
i
think
it
is
important,
number
one,
to
decide
this
case
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
review
those
facts,
because
i
must
say
my
view
of
them
does
not
in
every
particular,
accord
with
what
the
court
has
just
heard.
briefly,
on
the
morning
of
august
27th,
these
two
officers
boarded
this
greyhound
bus,
at
roughly
8:00
or
so
in
the
morning.
as
they
got
on,
the
driver
got
off
and
went
inside,
closing
the
door
of
the
bus
behind
him.
the
officers
had
no
suspicion
of
anyone
of
the
bus
that
morning.
nonetheless,
they
both
wore
raid
jackets
that
had
the
words
sheriff's
office,
not
only
across
the
back,
but
across
the
front
of
the
jacket.
we
haven't
heard
anything
yet
today
about
the
gun,
not
so
much
as
one
word.
but
there
was
a
gun
indisputably
in
the
record.
indeed,
on
page
five
of
florida's
brief,
they
concede
that
the
gun
in
officer
nutt's
hand,
in
a
pouch
was
recognizable
as
a
gun.
and
that,
i
think,
is
a
very
critical
point.
that
a
gun--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--justice
scalia,
it
is
one
thing,
i
think,
to
have
a
gun
concealed.
it
is
another
to
choose
to
display
it
in
a
way
that
brings
to
mind
to
the
person
you
are
talking
to
that
you
are
indeed
armed,
and
you
are
prepared
to
deal
with
force
if
necessary.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
was
in
a
pouch,
and
the
testimony
is
ambiguous,
as
to
whether
or
not
at
some
point
during
the
encounter,
officer
nutt
put
his
hand
into
the
zippered
pouch
and
put
it
on
the
gun.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
you
can
wear
a
shoulder
holster.
there
are
a
number
of
ways
to
do
it.
officer
rubino
had
his
gun
concealed,
that
is
to
say,
not
out
where
it
could
be
seen.
so
the
fact
that
this
gun
was
there,
and
bostick's
testimony
was
that
the
hand
was
at
times
inside
the
zipper
on
the
gun.
the
testimony
of
officer
nutt
was
not
contrary.
it
was
that
sometimes
he
does
put
his
hand
on
the
gun
inside
the
zipper,
and
he
doesn't
remember
whether
on
this
particular
day
he
did
or
not.
in
any
event,
as
i
said--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
point
is
not,
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
not
that
it
is,
per
se,
objectionable.
none
of
these
items
are,
per
se,
objectionable.
we
are
dealing
with
what
a
reasonable
person
concludes
from
all
the
circumstances.
and
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
present
the
full
picture
of
the
circumstances
so
as
to
make
my
argument--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
likely
conclusion.
but--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances,
and
then
i
think
if
i
can
have
a
moment,
i
will
try
to
explain
how
i
think
they
fit
together.
in
any
event,
the
officers
did
go
to
the
back
of
the
bus.
as
was
indicated,
mr.
bostick
was
reclining
on
the
last
seat
on
the
bus.
whether
he
was
asleep
or
not
is
disputed
and
there
are,
of
course,
no
fact-findings
here,
so
we
don't
know
what
the
court
found.
but,
he
was
clearly
lying
down,
attempting
to
get
some
rest,
and
was
roused,
either
by
being
touched
on
the
foot,
which
was
his
testimony,
mr.
bostick's
testimony;
or
by
simply
being
talked
to,
which
was
the
officer's
testimony.
that
occurred
at
a
time
when
officer
nutt
was
standing,
i
think
by
the
undisputed
testimony,
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
aisle
in
front
of
mr.
bostick.
that
is
to
say,
half
in
and
half
out
of
an
aisle
which
is
about
15
inches
wide
according
to
fact-finding
in
u.s.
v.
chandler
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
is
relating
to
a
greyhound
bus.
officer
rubino,
it
is
not
quite
clear
where
he
was,
but
he
was
apparently
in
the
row
also
directly
in
front
of
mr.
bostick.
so
the
two
of
them
were
confronting
mr.
bostick
very
directly.
and
then
you
had
the
conversations
that
took
place.
the
officers
identifying
themselves.
it
is
not
clear
what
more
they
said
than
that.
they
asked
where
mr.
bostick
where
he
was
traveling
to.
he
said
atlanta.
they
asked
to
see
his
ticket
and
his
identification.
he
presented
them.
they
were
in
order
and
the
names
matched
so
they
were
given
back.
and
immediately
thereafter,
apparently,
mr.
bostick
was
asked
if
he
would
consent
to
a
search
of
the
red
bag
which
didn't
belong
to
him,
and
then
subsequently
would
consent
to
a
search
of
the
blue
bag
which
did.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
again,
it
depends
upon
this
court's
fact-finding
on
this
record.
and
officer
nutt
does
say
at
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix,
on
cross-examination,
he
does
not
say
it
on
his
direct
testimony;
but
on
cross-examination,
he
says
that
he
told
him
he
had
a
right
to
refuse
consent.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
several
other
accounts
of
the
conversation
by
the
officers,
and
the
officers
indicate
in
those
conversations
nothing
about
that
particular--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--there
is
no
fact-finding,
justice
white,
whatsoever,
by
the
trial
court
except
the
ruling
on
the
motion.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
certainly
on
the
issue
of
consent,
that
is
true
because
that
fact,
even
though
there
were
no
fact-findings,
that
fact
was
necessarily
decided
by
the
trial
judge.
you
would
not
have
any
basis
for
this
search
absent
consent.
thereby,
by
denying
the
suppression
motion,
it
is
necessarily
implicit
that
there
was
consent.
now
whether
or
not
the
other
statement,
the
warning
or
whatever,
that
you
have
a
right
not
to
consent
was
made,
i
think
doesn't
follow
necessarily--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--they
did
not
make
anything
of
the
contrary.
the
only
point
i
would
make
is
that
they
did
change
the
question
presented.
the
question
as
it
was
presented
by
the
intermediate
florida
court
included
the
premise
that
he
had
in
fact
been
advised.
if
you
look
at
page--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--page
b1
of
the...
i
am
sorry.
yes,
page
b1
of
the
joint
appendix
and
b2,
the
question
as
presented
there
says
at
the
end,
has
the
right,
and
they
advise
the
passenger
that
he
has
the
right
to
refuse
consent
to
search.
the
florida
supreme
court,
for
unstated
reasons,
changed
the
question
presented
over
on
a1
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
to
omit
that
premise.
so
it
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me
that
the
florida
supreme
court
assumed
that
that
consent
had
been
given.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
don't
seek
to
make
a
great
deal
of
whether
he
was
advised
or
not
either.
because,
frankly,
i
don't
think
it
is
terribly
important.
the
issue
here
is
whether
mr.
bostick
was
seized
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
would
state
the
legal
test
roughly
as
follows,
trying
to
incorporate
this
court's
thinking
in
a
series
of
cases:
mendenhall
and
delgado.
but
also
in
the
more
recent
opinion
in
inyo
v.
broward
county,
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
something
like
this:
whether
intentional
police
conduct,
in
the
setting
in
which
it
plainly
is
occurring,
that
is
on
a
bus,
communicated
to
a
reasonable
person,
by
which
i
mean
an
innocent
person,
that
he
is
not
free
to
leave
the
presence
of
the
officer,
assuming
that
he
would
want
to
leave
the
presence
of
the
officer.
and
i
would
argue,
based
on
the
facts
that
i
just
reviewed
that
a
reasonable
person
here
would
plainly
feel
that
he
had
been
and
was
being
temporarily
detained
for
the
purpose
of
being
questioned
by
these
officers.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
don't
think
we
know
that,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
if
you
assume,
if
you
assume
that
everyone
who
is
on
a
bus
that
is
laying
over
temporarily
in
an
intermediate
city
does
not
want
to
get
off
that
bus,
i
think
as
an
initial
matter,
you
can
probably
say,
yes,
that
is
right.
that
is,
you
don't
want
to
get
off
because
you
have
a
ticket
to
atlanta
and
we
are
in
ftlauderdale,
and
i
don't
want
to
go
to
ftlauderdale.
i
want
to
go
to
atlanta.
that
doesn't
mean
that
events
can't
occur
on
that
bus
that
can
cause
you
to
say,
you
know,
i
would
just
as
soon
get
off
in
ft
lauderdale.
i
would
just
as
soon
not
be
here
being
questioned
by
officer
so
and
so,
and
i
have
changed
my
mind.
i
would
like
to
leave.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
is
in
a
position,
or
would
want
to
make
the
judgment,
that
because
someone
had
bought
a
through
ticket,
that
they
had
lost
the
right
to
decide
to
get
off
the
bus
at
an
intermediate
point,
if
indeed
they
decide
that
that
is
what
they
want
to
do.
and
that
is
why,
in
stating
the
tests
that
i
have
stated,
i
have
put
it
in
terms
of
the
intentional
police
conduct
and
its
effect,
in
the
setting,
on
a
person,
assuming
the
person
decides
he
wants
to
leave.
so
i
think
what
you
have
to
look
at
is
the
overall
set
of
factors
that
would
restrict
one,
apart
from
the
fact
that
you
generally
start
with
a
preference
not
to
get
off
the
bus.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
we
agree.
they
are
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
he
is
free
to
leave.
nonetheless,
well,
let
me
come
back
to
the
question
of
whether
they
are
relevant
at
all
to
the
fourth
amendment
issue
here.
but
specifically,
the
confinement
that
results
here,
i
think
results
from
three
different
sort
of
collections
of
factors.
and
i
would
enumerate
them
as
follows:
first
of
all,
obvious
physical
confinement
within
the
bus,
that
is
to
say,
the
bus
itself
is
a
very
small
area.
there
are
very
few
ways
to
move
about
on
a
bus.
you
don't
have
just
much
room
to
get
around.
there
is
one
exit.
it
is
at
the
front
of
the
bus.
and
in
this
case,
the
officer
was
half
in
the
aisle
which
is
15
inches
wide.
the
door
to
the
bus
is
closed,
and
there
is
another
officer
standing,
right,
practically
in
his
face.
so
you
have,
number
one,
these
factors
of
physical
confinement.
number
two,
you
have
police
officers
who
are
making
apparent,
that
is
to
say
they
are
communicating
by
their
actions,
their
ability
to
use
force
if
they
need
to
do
it
or
believe
it
is
appropriate
to
do
it.
that
is
to
say,
they
are
displaying
in
a
visible
form,
not
to
say,
out
of
its
purse,
but
nonetheless
in
a
visible
form,
they
are
making
observers
aware
that
they
have
a
weapon
handy
if
they
need
it.
and
they
are
wearing
raid
jackets,
which
i
think
most
people
are
familiar
with
from
watching
television,
as
garments
that
are
worn
by
law
enforcement
officers
when
the
officers
are
most
typically
engaged
in
arresting
people
and
carrying
out
somewhat
urgent
law
enforcement
activities.
so
they
have
the
garb
and
the
outward
dress
of
readiness
for
action,
that
is
the
second
factor.
and
the
third,
which
i
think
may
be
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
is
the
apparent
purposefulness
of
their
behavior
by
virtue
of
several
specific
aspects
of
what
went
on.
a
couple
of
them
are
minor,
i
think,
sounding,
but
when
you
put
them
together,
become
more
significant.
the
touching
on
the
foot,
a
sort
of
an
indication,
you
know,
if
you
spell
it
out...
you
may
want
to
rest,
but
we
want
to
talk
to
you.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
touching
someone
on
the
foot
is,
per
se,
unconstitutional,
by
any
means.
i
am
simply
suggesting
that
it
is
one
of
the
factors,
as
this
court
indicated
in
mendenhall,
a
physical
touching
is
one
thing
that
may
sometimes
indicate
or
tend
to
indicate
a
seizure.
so
it
is
one
factor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
or
not.
i
think
that
would
raise
another
of
the
mendenhall
factors.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
guess
i
think
that
there,
if
you
have
no
reasonable
suspicion
of
someone
and
he
is
asleep--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
would
certainly
not
say
that
there
is
a,
per
se,
bar
on
doing
it
at
all.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
that
it
tends
to
make
the
encounter
feel
more
like
a
command
performance.
that
is,
that
one
is
directed
by
the
police;
and
if
one
is
directed,
and
one
in
fact
has
the
right
to
decline,
i
think
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tension
there.
i
think
that
is
something
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
will
put
it
this
way,
i
think
certainly
if
they
had
tapped
him
on
the
foot,
and
they
had
said,
we
have
a
couple
of
questions
we
would
like
to
ask
you.
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
us,
and
you
are
free
to
leave.
certainly,
that
would
have
ended
any
question
whatsoever.
i
mean
not
saying
that
again,
that
that
is
required.
but
that
would
certainly
be
a
way
of
addressing
that
problem.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no,
we
don't.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
is
true.
we
have
a
record
that
is
unclear
on
both
of
those
points.
what
we
have,
we
have
him--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--we
are
talking
about
it
because--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the
court
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
determination
as
to
what
facts
it
believes
has
occurred
in
order
to
decide
whether
the
situation
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
not
necessarily,
only
if
you
think
you
have
to
in
order
to
decide
the
case.
and
i
would
suggest
you
probably
don't.
a
second
thing
that
i
think,
well,
two
other
things
i
think
are
worth
mentioning
with
regard
to
the
purposefulness.
one
is
the
request
for
documents.
that
is
to
say,
focusing
attention
specifically
on
mr.
bostick.
and
the
most
important
one
i
think
has
to
do
really
with
where
this
is
taking
place.
i
think
we
in
this
country
are
lucky,
very
lucky
to
be
able
to
take
for
granted
some,
what
you
could
sort
of
call
quasi-public,
quasi-private
places,
places
like
restaurants,
churches,
where
you
can't
say
that
they
are
private
in
the
sense
that
police
officers
or
other
people
may
never
go
in
there.
of
course,
they
can
go
in
there,
and
you
can't
object
to
that.
on
the
other
hand,
they
are
places
where
people
typically
expect
that
they
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
go
about
their
business
unless
there
is
some
significant
reason
for
interruption.
and
what
that
bears
upon
is
not
the
notion
that
it
is,
a
per
se,
or
any
other
kind
of
violation,
simply
to
go
on
a
bus.
it
rather
bears
upon
how
a
reasonable
person
would
interpret
it.
if
you
were
sitting
in
a
restaurant
and
an
officer
came
into
the
restaurant
in
uniform,
which
he
obviously
would
have
a
perfect
right
to
do,
and
he
came
directly
to
your
table,
and
he
addressed
you
and
asked
you
for
your
driver's
license,
the
assumption
that
i
think
most
people
would
make
would
be
that
the
officer
was
there
in
order
to
carry
out
some
specific,
purposeful
mission
that
the
officer
needed
to
carry
out.
one
wouldn't
be,
i
think,
necessarily
totally
pleased
because
one
might
have
the
impression
that
one
had
become
some
sort
of
a
target
of
inquiry.
and
i
think
that
same
kind
of
reasoning
transfers
over
here,
where
you
are
talking
about,
say
a
bus
or
an
airplane
or
a
train,
a
situation
where
i
think
most
people
generally
expect
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
approached.
if
they
are
going
to
be
approached,
i
will
put
it
this
way,
it
is
going
to
be
for
some
reason.
now
again,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
officers
can't
ever
do
it,
and
i
don't
argue
that.
i
am
simply
arguing
now,
what
would
a
reasonable
person
conclude
from
this
event
occurring?
and
my
suggestion
is
that
a
reasonable
person
would
conclude
that
the
officer
was
about
some
business,
very
purposeful
business;
and
the
officer
in
this
case,
both
blocking
the
way
out,
displaying
force
and
an
ability
to
use
force,
communicates
a
sense
of
an
intention
to
accomplish
the
mission
that
he
was
about.
that
is
to
say,
to
identify
the
defendant,
look
at
his
papers
and
then
to
go
about
searching
his
luggage.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
that
would
be
fine,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
quite
reasonable.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yes.
i
think
those
are...
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
facts
that
are
really
quite
clear
on
the
record.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that
is
correct.
and
under
this
brief
statement,
we
do
not.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
would...
i
haven't
looked
into
this
too
far,
but
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps
it
raises
a
question
to
simply
ignore
the
facts
of
this
case,
or
for
this
court
to
simply
decide
the
case,
ignoring
the
facts
of
this
case,
simply
on
the
basis
of
a
very
brief
statement
of
a
question,
certified
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
would
not
reach
that
conclusion,
justice
scalia,
based
on
what
follows
on
page
a2,
the
discussion
quoting
directly
from
the
dissent
in
the
district
court
of
appeals.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
are
certainly
not
asking
this
court
for
a
rule
of
law
that
you
can't
have
bus
searches.
it
seems
to
us
perfectly
clear
that
the
judgment
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
all
the
circumstances.
and
the
circumstances
here
i
think
really
do
break
into
two
categories.
there
are
the
peculiar,
aggravating
circumstances
that
i
think
fairly
can
be
said
are
unmatched
in
any
of
the
later
cases
that
you
find
either
in
the
federal
courts
or
the
state
courts.
the
factors
relating
to
the
display
of
this
gun,
in
the
pouch
visible
and
recognizable
as
a
gun;
the
blocking
of
the
aisle
that
is
half
way
in,
half
way
out
of
the
aisle;
the
fact
that
the
door
to
the
bus
is
closed
throughout
this
encounter.
how
would
a
person
get
off
the
bus
if
he
wanted
to?
those
are
unique
facts
here.
i
think
everything
i
have
just
said
is
utterly
undisputed
on
the
record.
there
is
no
dispute
that
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
on
those
facts,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
very
hard
to
say
that
there
was
not
a
confinement,
especially
when
you
look
at
the
second
category
of
facts
which
i
would
describe
as
the
generic
facts,
the
generic
bus
search
facts,
which
i
think
frankly
raise
very
serious
problems,
questions
about
whether
there
is
a
seizure.
but
by
no
means,
is
every
bus
search
without
reasonable
suspicion,
going
to
involve
a
seizure.
again,
just
to
repeat
that
generic
set
of
facts
includes,
as
justice
kennedy
noted,
it
includes
the
fact
that
you
have
got
a
busload
of
passengers
who
basically
don't
want
to
get
off,
and
the
police
are
taking
advantage
of
that
desire.
maybe
they
have
their
luggage
under
the
bus
in
the
storage.
maybe
they
have
given
up
their
ticket.
maybe
they
can't
afford
to
stay
overnight
in
ftlauderdale,
lots
of
reasons
they
don't
want
to
get
off
and
the
police
are
saying,
we
have
sort
of
a
captive
audience.
i
think
that
is
a
problem.
but
the
bigger
problem
is
the
fact
that
people
on
a
bus,
like
people
on
an
airplane,
like
people
in
church,
like
people
in
a
restaurant,
think
if
an
officer
comes
on
board
or
comes
into
the
restaurant
and
comes
up
to
them
and
focuses
on
them
and
doesn't
say,
this
is
just
routine
or
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
me
or
something
that
contradicts
the
inference
of
the
situation,
something
that
says,
relax,
we
are
not
after
you.
this
is
just
a
routine
conversation
we
are
having.
when
you
focus
in
on
somebody
in
those
settings,
the
normal
person
is
going
to
say--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
delgado
is
distinguishable
on
the
ground
that
the
setting
is
entirely
different
in
the
sense
of
confinement.
the
bus,
obviously,
there
is
simply
no
where
to
go.
there
is
not
a
foot
or
two
hardly
to
move
in.
in
the
factory,
the
opinion
for
the
court
made
clear
that
there
is
an
opportunity
to
move
around
the
factory.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no.
but
i
think
the
question
is,
would
a
reasonable
person
feel
that
they
were
put
in
a
situation
where
they
were
detained,
that
is
to
say,
their
physical
freedom,
to
move
about
and
to
move
out
of
the
presence
of
the
officer
had
been
restricted.
and
i
think
where
you
have
an
entire
factory
to
move
around
in,
it
is
a
far
different
circumstance
than
where
you
simply
have
no
where
to
go
at
all
to
get
away
from
the
presence
of
the
officer,
and
you
are
relying
entirely,
as
the
other
side
has
argued
in
their
brief
is
enough,
you
are
relying
entirely
on
the
willingness
of
the
officer
to
walk
away
from
you
because
you
can't
go
anywhere.
i
think
it
is
a
very,
very
different
circumstance.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
number
one,
i
don't
see
how
he
could
move
even
three
seats
away
here.
but
in
any
event,
if
i
understand
the
argument
you
are
making,
justice
scalia,
it
would
suggest
that
if
there
is
a
building
that
has
for
some
reason
a
little
nook
that
has
three
walls
and
somebody
is
leaning
against
the
wall
sunning
himself
and
the
nook
is
only
2
feet
wide
and
an
officer
walks
up
to
him
and
blocks
the
way
out,
and
says,
i
want
to
talk
to
you--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
would
agree
with
that.
i
would
agree
that
one
would
not
be
seized
in
that
circumstance.
i
think
on
the
other
hand...
on
the
other
hand
i
think
here,
where
the
officers
have
boarded
the
bus,
and
they
have
approached
someone
who
is
in
the
back
of
the
bus
and
they
have
acted
in
a
way
that
they
should
know,
and
really
must
know,
communicates
a
sense
of
their
control,
that
they
have
to
take
responsibility
for
that.
that
they
can't
say,
as
is
argued,
you
chose
to
put
yourself
on
the
bus.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
our
argument
really
is
that
here
he
had
no
where
to
go
at
all.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
my
view
is
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--we
are
not
asking
for
that
rule--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
that
is
broader
than
the
rule
should
be.
i
think
on
the
other
hand
that
there
are--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
if
the
police--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--if
the
police
go
out
of
their
way
to
negate
what
i
believe
to
be
the
normal
inference
that
a
person
would
draw
from
the
rather
unusual,
to
most
passengers,
occurrence
of
an
officer
coming
on
a
bus,
that
is
to
say,
he
is
here
for
a
reason--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
they
shouldn't
say
that,
but
i
think
if
they
say,
you
are
free
to
leave.
this
is
routine
questioning.
you
know,
we
have
a
real
drug
problem
here
and
we
would
like
to
talk
to
you.
i
think
my
view
is
that
that
would
be
acceptable,
as
long
as
they
do
nothing
else--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
that
is
going
too
far,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
