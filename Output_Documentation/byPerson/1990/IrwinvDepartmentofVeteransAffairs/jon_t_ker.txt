mr.
jon
t.
ker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
2000e-16(c)
is
a
jurisdictional
requirement
upon
title
vii
federal
employee
claimants
can
be
addressed
with...
from
four
bases,
the
first
one
being
that
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
the
second
being
legislative
intent,
third
being
from
the
case
law
itself
and
from...
the
fourth
being
bowen
v.
the
city
of
new
york
as
what
petitioner
asserts
as
being
squarely
in
point
here.
looking
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
this
has
been
a
broad
waiver
of
immunity
and
there...
within
in
the
statute
itself
is
no
clear
jurisdictional
language.
there
is
not
the
language
of
no
action
may
be
commenced
or
actions
are
prohibited
such
as
was
the
case
in
the
hallstrom
v.
tillamook
case.
with
that
in
mind,
this
court
in
bowen,
addressing
the
argument
of
whether
or
not
405(g)
was
a
jurisdictional
requisite
cited
that
the
traditional
meaning
of
words
applies.
in
that
respect,
taylor
v.
the
united
states,
110
supreme
court
2143,
looked
at
the
generic
or
contemporary
meaning
of
words.
the
ordinary
meaning
of
words
as
being
used
as
in
ins
v.
cardoza-fonsoca.
and
then
again
the
language
from
this
court
in
consumer
product
safety
commission
v.
gte
you
look
at
the
common
usage
of
words
being
used.
with
that
backdrop
we
submit
that
the
traditional
view
of
filing
periods
is
that
they
are
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
i
did
not
cite
dalm.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
thank
you,
justice
o'connor.
with
respect
to
the
dalm
case,
i
did
not
cite
that
one,
and
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
facts
of
that
case.
however,
i
would
address
your
attention
to
again
the
bowen
case,
but
also
the
hallstrom
v.
tillamook
case.
both
of
those
cases
support
the
petitioner
here.
in
bowen
the
court,
looking
at
the
sovereign
immunity
argument,
stated
that
the
court
adopts
the
strict
construction
requirement
where
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
but
went
on
to
state
that
under...
even
though
we
look
at
it
in
a
strict
sense,
they're
not
to
look
too
narrowly
where
the
congressional
intent
is
clear
that
it
wasn't
to
be
construed
narrowly.
that
again
in
bowen
and
i
can...
also
in
hallstrom,
your
honor,
it's
stated
concerning
that
particular
provision...
and
that
upheld
the
government's
side
in
that
case...
but
in
hallstrom
we
were
looking
at
a
different
type
of
situation
where
the
statute
itself
provided
for
the
action
that
was
not
taken
and
it
was
distinguishable
from
bowen.
and
i--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--yes.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
provision
in
bowen
was
similar
to
this
one
by
the
use
of
the
word
may.
the
statute
itself,
looking
at
the
language
within
the
statute,
talks
about
the
claimant
may
file
a
suit
within
30
days.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
thank
you,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
submit
that
where
we
ought
to
be
is,
following
the
overall
objectives
of
title
vii
being
to
literally
construe
that
statute
to
protect
the
intended
class.
with...
with
that
in
mind--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
i
did
not,
but
the
government
did.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
in
the
library
of
congress
v.
shaw,
the
issue
is
dealing
with
interest
upon
attorneys'
fees
and
that's
clearing
an
area
that
the
federal
government
has
never,
historically,
never
waived
sovereign
immunity
as
to
that
factor.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
however,
your
honor,
in...
again,
i
submit
that
shaw
is
distinguishable
upon
that
fact
because
in
shaw
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
interest
upon
attorneys'
fees
had
been
waived.
and,
again,
i
submit
that
the
bowen
case
is
more
analogous.
in
bowen,
which
deal
with
405(g),
in
that
case
this
court
stated
that
even
though
we're
dealing
with
an
area
of
sovereign
immunity
that
should
be
strictly
construed,
that
does
not
mean
that
you
should
narrowly
restrict
or
overly
be
restrictive
upon
the
congressional
intent
in
the
broad
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
through
title
vii
itself.
additionally,
in...
in
the
area
of--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--in
all
likelihood,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
scalia.
and
in
that
respect
i
submit
that
in
title
vii
where
you
have
the
overall
objective
of
eradication
of
invidious
discrimination
and
particularly
in
federal
government
under
the
1972
amendments,
the--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
what
i
mean
is
is
that
following
the
plain
language,
clear
intention
of
congress
argument,
coupling
those
two...
and
again,
the
language
is
not
so
plain
as
to
do
away
with
any
ambiguity.
i'm
not
saying
that
either.
however,
the
language
that
is
in
16(c)
is
so
similar
to
405(g)
that
that
extension
of
the
tolling
into
that
area
of
sovereign
immunity
certainly
comports
with
the
overall
objective
of
congress.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
mr.
justice
scalia,
i
would
say
that
probably
the
distinction
is...
is
fine
in
that
area,
but--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--well,
i--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
the--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--yes,
sir,
and
the
circuits
are...
while
they
are
divided
i
think
the
majority
of
the
circuits
support
the
petitioner's
argument
here
that
it
is
subject
to
equitable
tolling,
and
i
might
add
one
other
thing,
too.
in
the
hallstrom
case,
the
language
there
was
much
more
specific.
it
talked
about
actions
prohibited.
and
you
may
not
bring
an
action
prior
to
60-day
notice.
that
type
of
language
is
the
type
of
language
that
if
congress
had
used
it,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
but
the
language
as
used
has
within,
again,
the
meaning
of
the
words
used
and
within
the
intent
of
congress,
we
submit,
does
show
that
equitable
tolling
was
not
to
be
specifically
excluded.
that
had
congress
intended
such,
they
would
have
said
so.
even
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
amendments
we
don't
find
any
language
specifically
addressing
any
prohibition
upon
the...
the
application
of
equitable
tolling.
there's
another
fine
distinction
in
the
bowen
case.
in
the
bowen
case
the
statute
there
allowed
the
secretary
of
the...
i
want
to
say
health,
education
and
welfare...
it's
health
and
human
services...
allowed
a
legal
tolling
in
that
case.
that
also
is
not
a
distinguishing
factor
here
because
even
within
bowen,
which
had
the
legal
tolling
ability,
still
applied
the
equitable
tolling
principle.
and
the...
i
submit
that
bowen
is
applicable
here.
an...
an
additional
factor,
too,
that
addressed
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
that
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
concerning
administrative
remedies
and
the
application
of
equitable
tolling
there,
i
submit
that
the
administrative
exhaustion
of
remedies
is
certainly
more
central
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
being
exercised
by
the
district
court
than
the
filing
period.
but
in
bowen
and
in
zipes,
federal
employee
and
private
employee,
in
both
of
those
situations,
the
exhaustion
remedies
has
been
held
to
be
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
i've
gotten
into
my
second
point,
that
being
of
legislative
intent
to
some
degree.
and
i
might
add
that
the
1972
amendments
were
enacted
against
the
backdrop
of
cases
that
were
liberally
construing
the
remedial
nature
of
the
statute
to
protect
the
intended
class
and
that
the
federal
employees
were
intended
to
have
essentially
the
same
rights
as
the
private
employees.
in
that
respect,
too,
the
federal
government
should
be
the
example
for
all
of
our
society
in
the
eradication
of
discrimination.
it
would...
it
would
not
be
consistent
in...
i
would
submit
it
this
way.
it's
not
consistent
with
the
overall
purpose
of
the
act
to
allow
the
federal
government
to...
to
not
be
subject
to
equitable
tolling
where
there
is,
we
submit,
a
broad
waiver
of
immunity,
where
that
would
operate
to
preclude
the
intended
class,
where
such
would
be
in
essence
laying
behind
the
law.
it
just
wasn't
the
intent
of
congress
in
my...
in
my
humble
opinion
to
have
that
happen.
the
legislative
history
again
reveals
that
congress
had
adopted
the
previous
cases,
both
this
court's
and
the
lower
courts',
concerning
administrative
exhaustion.
against
that
backdrop,
congress
could
have
stated
more
specifically
had
they
intended
a
nonwaiver.
the
third
basis
is
that
of
existing
case
law
zipes
and
crown,
cork
and
seal
held
that
filing
requirements
for
the
private
sector
employees
were
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
albemarle
paper
and
franks
v.
bowman
held
that
the
administrative
exhaustion
was
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
and
even
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
federal
employee
arena
has
recently
held
in
rennie
v.
garrett
at
896
fed.
2d
1057th
that...
and
in
that
case
they
reverse
sims
v.
heckler,
held
that
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
was
not
a
jurisdictional
requirement
for
the
federal
employee
stating
a
finding
of
jurisdictional
subjects
the
federal
employees
to
summary
dismissal
resulting
from
factual
determinations
made
beyond
the
face
of
plaintiff's
pleadings,
a
determination
of
which
is
prohibited
in
the
private
sector
cases.
if
congress
intended
the
federal
employees
to
be
treated
similarly
and
essentially
the
same
as
private
employees,
we
would
submit
that
that
language
should
hold
true
and
that
the
equitable
tolling
apply.
the
language
that
i
was
looking
for
in
the
bowen
v.
city
of
new
york
is
that
the
accepting
of
the
proposition,
quoting
this
court,
however
does
not
answer
the
question
whether
equitable
tolling
can
be
applied
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
for
in
construing
the
statute
we
must
be
careful
not
to
assume
the
authority
to
narrow
the
waiver
congress
intended
or
to
construe
the
waiver
unduly
restrictively.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
did
not
write
it
in
my
notes.
i
apologize.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
yes,
sir,
i
certainly
will.
this
court
further
went
on--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--thank
you,
your...
i
was
just
going
to
say
479.
thank
you,
mr.
justice
scalia.
in
the
bowen
case
this
court
went
on
to
state
further
that
the
application
of
the
traditional
equitable
tolling
principle
is
fulling
consistent
with
the
overall
congressional
purpose
and
nowhere
eschewed
by
congress.
and
i
believe
that
is
found
on
page
480.
in
that
respect,
we
had
the
same
situation
existing
here
that
the
equitable
tolling
is
fully
consistent
with
the
overall
congressional
purposes,
and
the
language,
both
in
the
statute
itself
and
in
the
legislative
history
does
not
indicate
that
congress
had
intended
anything
else.
the
second
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
notice
must
be
had
by
the
claimant
himself
or
whether
a
constructive
notice
applies.
and,
again,
i
submit
that
there
are
a
plain
language
argument
to
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
that
we
look
to
the
statute,
the
regulations,
the
notice
letter
itself,
and
again,
case
decisions.
in
the
statute
it
states
that
within
30
days
of
receipt
of
notice
of
final
action
an
employee
or
applicant
may
file
a
civil
action.
had
congress
intended
constructive
notice
to
comply,
congress
could
have
inserted--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--well,
mr.
justice
scalia,
in
this
case
notice
was
received
at
my
office
at
a
time
when
i
had
departed
the
country
for
the
republic
of
korea,
and
the
court
applied
the
constructive
notice
standard
to
say
that
receipt
at
my
office
was...
was--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--well,
what's
unusual
about
that,
mr.
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
that...
that
step
actually
is
a
double
constructive
notice.
receipt
at
my
office
is
not
actual
receipt
by
myself.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
yes,
sir,
but
the
cases
have
held.
the
cases
that
i've--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--well,
the
cases
i
had
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
no,
sir.
the
lower
circuits
are
even
here
divided
because
the
fifth
circuit
applied
the
constructive
notice,
but
in
craig
v.
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
in
rea
v.
middendorf,
and
in
bell
v.
brown,
the
d.c.
circuit,
the
eighth
circuit,
and
i
believe
it
was
the
sixth
circuit,
applied
the
standard
that
actual
notice
was
what
was
intended
by
congress.
now
two
of
those
cases
stated--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--i
believe
that's
correct,
yes,
sir.
and
the
rationale
behind
that
is
that
even
though
there
may
be
a
counsel
representing
a
title
vii
claimant
through
the
administrative
process,
there's
nothing
in
that
relationship
that
says
that
absolutely
that...
that
relationship
wouldn't
continue
thereafter.
so,
consequently,
had
the
claimant
specifically
designated
in
accordance
with
the...
as
i
understand
the
eeoc
regulations...
that
he
can
designate
his...
his
representative
to
receive
actual
notice.
but
actual
notice
is
what
is
intended
under
the
act.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
april...
april
the
7th.
now
that...
there
was
an
affidavit
submitted.
and
the
copy
of
the
envelope
was
also
submitted
to
show
that
it
was
april
the
7th.
the
return
receipt
for
the
claimant's
acceptance
of
the
notice
has
never
been
produced.
and
i...
so,
as
far
as
that
return
receipt,
we
don't
know.
but
the
affidavit
of
mr.
irwin
was
that
he
received
it
on
or
about
april
the
7th,
but
april
the
7th
was
the
date
that
it
shows
on
the
envelope
itself.
receipt
at
my
office
was
march
the
23d
preceding
that.
actually
receipt
by
myself
was
april
the
10th
upon
my
return
to
my
office
from
both
korea
and
from
the
hospital
at
ft.
hood.
but
the
cases
that
have
in...
the
lower
court
cases
that
have
interpreted
this
issue,
the...
the...
and
it's
frankly
even
in
the
fifth
circuit,
polly
soto
v.
weinberger,
which
was
cited
by
myself,
by
mr....
judge
sessions
prior
to
his
becoming
of
the
head
of
the
fbi.
he
even
stated,
in
view
of
eastland
v.
tennessee
valley
authority,
which
said
that
all
of
this
was
jurisdictional
anyway,
by
the
fifth
circuit,
that
even
in
view
of
that,
that
constructive
notice
would
be
applicable
if
it
was
actually
received
by
the
attorney
and
receipted
by
him.
so,
in
that
scenario,
it's
nothing
unduly
burdensome
upon
the
eeoc.
indeed,
the
regulations--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--yes,
sir,
and
i
would...
in
addition
to
the
statute
which
talks
in
terms
of
the
complainant
himself
so
does
the
regulations
by
the
eeoc.
specifically,
29
c.f.r.
1613.281
deals
with
the
statutory
right
to
bring
an
action.
again,
this
is
the
regulations.
but
it
talks
in
terms
of
the
employee
or
the
applicant
being
authorized
to
file
a
suit.
now,
in
that
particular
language,
the
transition
from
the
consumer...
the
csc,
the
civil
service
commission,
to
the
eeoc,
there
was
the
deletion
in
that
particular
provision
of
the
word
his.
and
the
government
has
argued
that,
well,
that
clearly
shows
an
intent
that
constructive
notice
or
these
rules
of
agency
apply.
and
we
submit
that
the
dropping
of
the
word
his
did
not
change
any
of
the
case
law
and
that
it
simply
was
to
make
that
particular
regulation
neutrally...
as
far
as
gender,
to
make
it
neutral.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
constructive
notice
would
apply.
because
in
the
very
next
regulation,
1613.282,
notice
of
right
to
sue,
says
an
agency
shall
notify
an
employee
or
applicant
of
his
right
to
file
a
civil
action
and
of
the
30-day
time
limit
for
filing.
none
of
that
speaks
to
anything
other
than
the
claimant
himself
receiving
actually
notice.
and
the...
at
the
point
of
time
of
actual
notice
to
the
claimant
is
the
point
in
time
initiating
the
30-day
filing
period.
now,
we
would
concede
one
thing,
that
if
the
claimant
does
in
fact
designate
his
representative
to
receive
actually
notice
and
he
does
that
in
writing,
which
was
not
present
in
this
case,
specifically
authorizing
notice
to
be
sent
to
his
counsel
of
record,
the
actual
notice
then
to
the...
to
the
attorney
or
the
representative
would
indeed
constitute
actual
notice
in
the
initiation
of
the
30-day
period.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
thank
you,
justice
o'connor.
traditionally,
as
in
link
v.
wabash,
if
that's
what
your
honor
is
referring
to,
in
link
v.
wabash
this
court
looked
at
the
traditional
concept
of
representation
and
said,
we
have
a
long
history
of
representative-type
government.
i
don't
fault
that
at
all.
but
link
v.
wabash
relied
upon
rule
5.
rule
5
applies
to
service
under
these
rules.
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
what
we
have
is
a
situation
of
an
administrative
process,
then
the
initiation
of
an
action.
once
that
action
was
initiated,
yes,
rule
5
becomes
part
and
parcel
of
any
proceedings
thereafter
under
these
rules.
we
don't
have
that
dealing
with
the
administrative
process.
and,
again,
i
submit
that
simply
because
mr.
irwin
or
indeed
any
title
vii
claimant
may
have
legal
counsel
representing
him
through
the
administrative
process
does
not
mean
that
that
particular
representation
would
continue
through
the
filing
of
an
action.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
not
in
every
situation.
no,
sir.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
because
the
statute
and
the
regulations
both
state
the
terms
"claimant"
or
"applicant",
and
"you",
speaking
to
the--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--yes,
sir.
the
clear
language
of
that
is
receive
notice
by
the
claimant.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
i
can't
think
of
a
situation
outside
of
title
vii--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--but
under
title
vii,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
yes,
sir,
the
plain
language
of
that
would
be
that
the
claimant
receive
actual
notice,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
well,
i
believe
that
under
the
private
employee
situation
that
has
been
held
to
be
the
case.
but
there
we're
dealing
with
a
much
longer
period,
90
days.
here
we're
dealing
with
a
30-day
period
and
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
as
well
as
the
regulations
does
speak
in
terms
of
the
claimant.
it...
it
may
not
necessarily
be--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
white,
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
you
are
saying
if
the
claimant
was
to
leave
the
country
to
avoid
service?
mr.
jon
t.
ker
no,
sir.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
well,
i
also
stated
that
we
would--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--actual
notice
or
if
there
is
a
designation
by
the
claimant
to
the
eeoc
that
actual
notice
be
given
to--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--there
is
case
law,
your
honor,
to--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--there
is
case
law
to
assert
that
if,
say,
for
instance
he
moves
and
doesn't
give
notice
of...
to
the
eeoc.
that
could
be
constructive
notice.
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
it
is
actual.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
no,
sir.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
jon
t.
ker
a
registered
letter
signed
by
the
claimant
would
be
actual
notice,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
if
it's
signed
by
the
claimant,
then
that
is
actual
notice
to
the
claimant.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
well,
the
regulations
provide--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--yes,
sir,
the
regulations
of
the
eeoc
provide
for
certified
or
registered
mail,
return
receipt
requested,
and
that
would
be
actual
notice.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
yes,
sir.
if
there
would
be
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
concerning
the
notice...
the
rules
of
the
eeoc
i
submit
do
not
speak
to
serving
the
claimant
or
the
attorney
nor
does
it
speak
to
serving
the
claimant
and
the
attorney.
it
speaks
to
an
agency
shall
notify
an
employee
or
applicant
of
his
right
to
file
a
civil
action
and
of
the
30-day
time
limit.
that's
1613.282.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
the
claimant.
the
practice--
mr.
jon
t.
ker
--29
c.f.r.,
your
honor.
the
practice
is,
and
it
is
not
in
the
regulations.
but
the
practice
is
to
go
ahead
and
send
it
to
the
attorney.
why
not?
mr.
jon
t.
ker
no,
sir,
and
the
claimant
as
a
courtesy
to
the
attorney.
but
the
claimant
is
the
party
to
whom
notice
is
to
be
given.
mr.
jon
t.
ker
i
also
submit,
mr.
justice
scalia,
that
in
this
situation
you
don't
look
at
the
exact
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
interpreting
the
provision,
you
look
at
what
is
applicable
to
all
claimants.
it's
irrelevant
whether
or
not
i
or
anyone
else
represented
mr.
irwin
through
the
administrative
process.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
process
who's
entitled
to
notice
under
both
the
statute
and
the
regulations
and
that
is
the
claimant.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
or
not...
