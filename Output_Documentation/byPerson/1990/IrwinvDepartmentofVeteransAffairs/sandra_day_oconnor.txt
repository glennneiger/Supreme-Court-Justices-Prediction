justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
ker,
now...
excuse
me,
let
me
get
my
microphone
on...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
adopted
a
rule
of
strict
construction
where
the
government
itself
has
given
up
its
sovereign
immunity
and
permitted
suit
against
itself.
just
last
term
we
had
a
case,
u.s.
v.
dalm.
i
don't
think
you
cited--
justice
o'connor
--but
again
it
relied
on
the
sovereign
immunity
principle
to
construe
a
statute
worded
like
this
one
as
not
providing
equitable
tolling
relief.
so
how
do
you
reconcile
those
cases?
justice
o'connor
but,
mr.
ker--
justice
o'connor
--i
thought
in
bowen
the
court
said
there
was
language
by
which
congress
had
expressed
its
clear
intention
to
allow
tolling
in
some
cases.
now,
that's
distinguishable
here.
there
is
no
such
language.
there's
just
a
language
that
says
you'll
sue
within
30
days.
justice
o'connor
well,
maybe
the
court
hasn't
been
entirely
consistent
in
its
cases,
but
i
do
suggest
that
when
you
look
at
cases
like
mottaz
and
soriano
and
the
case
last
term,
u.s.
v.
dalm,
they
just
aren't
consistent
with
your
theory.
now,
i
don't
know
where
we
ought
to
be,
but
it
seems
to
me
there's
some
tension
there
and
we
may
have
to
work
it
out.
justice
o'connor
don't
you
think
under
our
system
generally
that
when
somebody
has
an
attorney
representing
them
we...
we
traditionally
think
that
notice
furnished
the
attorney
is
notice
to
the
litigant?
justice
o'connor
mr.
roberts,
what
do
you
make
of
our
cases
which
seem
to
go
really
in
different
directions.
the
bowen
case,
which
was
unanimous
and
contains
language
in
it
that
says
statutory
time
limits
are
traditionally
subject
to
equitable
tolling,
and
other
cases
like
maybe
soriano
and
dalm
which
point
in
the
other
direction,
the
library
of
congress
v.
shaw.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
now
come
back
to
the
question
which
i
asked
you
and
which
you
have
not
answered
to
my
knowledge.
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
in
bowen
when
it
says
that
statutory
time
limits
traditionally
are
subject
to
equitable
tolling?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
language
was
used
in
a
case
involving
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
in
cases
like
soriano
and
mottaz
you
can
point
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
said
something
like
suit
shall
be
barred
if
not
brought
within
so
many
days.
there
was
something
more
than
the
mere
time
limit
set
for
it
here.
