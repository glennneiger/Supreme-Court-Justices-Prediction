here,
at
least
you
could
say
that
service
on
his
attorney
isn't
enough.
it
might
be
that
service
at
his
house
might
be
enough
even
if
he
wasn't
there.
justice
white
why
does
it
have
to
mean
actual
notice
by
the
claimant?
isn't
there
some
way
of
serving...
suppose
the
actual
notice...
name
a
specific
person.
can
he
just
leave
the
country
and
avoid
service
of
process
all
the
time?
justice
white
well,
you
say
that
it
would
never
be
possible
to
have...
to
give
notice
to
the
claimant
unless
he
actually
receives
it.
justice
white
well,
you've
just
been
saying
it
all
the
time.
justice
white
haven't
you
been
saying
that,
actual
notice
to
the
claimant?
justice
white
he
gives
no
designation.
he
just
has
an
address.
they
have
his
address,
and
they
try
to...
they
want
to
give
him
notice.
they
send
him
registered
mail
to
his
address
or
they
go
and
leave
it
at
his
house.
justice
white
what
about
it?
justice
white
well,
so
it
isn't
actual
notice,
is
it?
justice
white
you
mean,
actual
constructive
notice.
justice

concede
that
if
the
government
wasn't
involved
that
the
30-day
time
limit
is
jurisdictional?
justice
white
so,
the
same
words
mean
different
things--
justice
white
--except
for
30
days?
justice
white
i
know.
justice
white
do
you
think
the
eeoc...
do
you
think
this
time
limit
could
be
waived?
i
guess
not.
justice
white
it
has
to
be
done
by
the
congress.
justice
white
xxx
dismissed
right
on
down
to
the
district
court?
justice
white
so,
the
district
court
should
not
have
entertained
it.
justice
white
how
about
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
do
we
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
jurisdictional
point?
justice
white
is
that...
is
that
in
the
rules
somewhere?
justice
white
i
know,
but
is
that...
does
the
eeoc
say
how
it's
supposed
to
give
notice?
justice
white
i
know
that's
what
it
does,
but
is
that
written
down
somewhere
that
that's
what
they
must
do?
justice
white
then
everybody
should
be
familiar
with
the
fact
that
notice
to
the
attorney
is
notice
to
the
claimant,
is
that
right?
justice
white
that
isn't
rightly
what
it
says,
is
it?
justice
white
so,
it
doesn't
say
at
all
that
that...
they
can
just
send
the
notice
to
the
attorney?
justice
white
so,
what
if
the...
what
if
the
general...
that
seems
to
say
that...
say
that
we
will
not
expect
notice
to
the
attorney
to
be
notice
to
the
claimant.
justice
white
well,
it
says
you
have
to
send
notice
to
the...
to
the
claimant.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
wouldn't
comply
with
their
own
rules
if
they
just
sent
a
notice
to
the
attorney.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
xxx
just
notify
the
attorney,
but
the
rule...
their
own
rule
says--
justice
white
--is
that
the
eeoc
regulation
you're
reading?
justice
white
alone?
