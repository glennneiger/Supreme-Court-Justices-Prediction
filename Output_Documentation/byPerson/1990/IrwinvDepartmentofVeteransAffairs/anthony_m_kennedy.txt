justice
kennedy
your
regulations,
i
understand
it,
provide
for
extending
the
30-day
period
if
the
time
falls...
if
the
30th
day
is
on
a
sunday?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
not
incorporate
the
normal
rules
about
equitable
tolling?
justice
kennedy
that
applies
to
claimants.
does
it
refer
to
attorneys
or
just
claimants?
justice
kennedy
i
suppose
it's
nowhere
in
the
record.
can
you
tell
me
how
often
the
claimants
are
not
represented
by
attorneys?
justice
kennedy
is
this
a
later
stage?
