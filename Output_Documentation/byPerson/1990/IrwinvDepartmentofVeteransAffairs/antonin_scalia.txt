justice
scalia
on
the
other
hand,
we
said
in
soriano...
and
i
don't
even
think
bowen...
i
don't
even
think
bowen
mentioned
soriano.
but
we
said
in
soriano
very
clearly
to
permit
the
application
of
the
doctrine
urged
by
petitioner
would
impose
the
tolling
of
the
statute
in
every
time
limit
consent
act
passed
by
the
congress.
but
congress
was
entitled
to
assume
that
the...
limitation
period
prescribed
meant
just
that
period
and
no
more.
i
think
we
sort
of
have
to
choose
between
soriano
and
bowen,
don't
you
think?
justice
scalia
are
we
going
to
decide
this
question
on
the
basis
of
how
important
we
think
the
particular
policy
of
the
statute
is,
and
if
we
like
the
policy
of
that
statute,
we
allow
a
tolling
and
if
we
don't
like
the
policy,
we
don't.
is
that
how
we
suggest
we
should
go?
justice
scalia
you
really
think
it's
a
big
difference.
it
says
no
suit
shall
be
brought
later
than
90
days
and
you
think
it
really
shows
a
different
intent
if
it
says,
suit
must
be
brought
or
shall
be
brought
within
90
days?
that...
that's
a
distinction
that
you
really
think
makes
it--
justice
scalia
--it
sure
is.
i
mean,
we
can
distinguish
the
cases
that
way,
but
don't
you
think
we
ought
to
get--
justice
scalia
--get
some
sold
line
of
jurisprudence
that
the
lower
courts
can
follow
in
all
of
these
areas?
justice
scalia
so
we
should
choose
between
soriano
and
bowen
[inaudible].
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
i...
i'm
not
sure
this
is
the
right...
i
don't
think
this
is
the
right
terminology.
you're
not
talking
constructive
notice.
constructive
notice
is...
real
notice
was
sent
to
nobody,
but...
but
somehow
he
got
word
of
it.
that...
that
would
be
constructive
notice.
but
here
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
normal
laws
of
agency
are
going
to
apply.
isn't
that
it?
whether
service
on
your
agent
will
be
service
on
you.
it
seems
strange
to
me
to
call
that
constructive
notice.
justice
scalia
xxx.
did...
did
some
agent
in
your
office--
--what...
what's
unusual
about
that?
justice
scalia
are
you
relying
in...
are
you
saying
that
whenever
any
statute
or
rule
says
nothing
more
specific
than
the
phrase
"receipt
of
notice"
that
we
should
interpret
that
to
mean
always
that
there
has
to
be
personal
receipt
and
service
upon
an
agent
and
not--
justice
scalia
--well,
why...
why
is
this
different?
justice
scalia
where
is
that?
i
don't
understand
why
that
makes
a
difference.
it
says
receipt
of...
notice
by
the
claimant,
i
assume.
right?
justice
scalia
and
you
say
whenever
a
statute
says
receipt
of
notice
by
someone,
we
should
interpret
that
to
mean
that
that
person
has
to
receive
it
personally
and
it's
not
enough
to
give
it
to
his
attorney?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
you
can
live
with
that,
really?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
title
vii.
i'm
talking
about
generally.
i...
we'll
talk
next
about
why
title
vii
is
any
different.
but
do
you
think
we
can
live
with
a
rule
like
that?
statutes
that
say
receipt
of
notice
by
x,
meaning
that
x
has
to
personally
be
given?
justice
scalia
briefly,
briefly.
the
court
noted
that...
that
language
briefly
in
bowen
and
seems
to
have
made
up
its
mind
before
it
got
to
that
point.
i
read
that
point
as
a
make-weight.
justice
scalia
and
rightly
so,
because
way
does
that
cut?
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
a
statute
that
specifically
provides
one
means
for
extending
the
time
period.
that
is,
the
secretary
can
provide
for
whatever
extension
there
should
be,
i
would
think
the
principle
of
inclusio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius
would
say
a
fortiori...
gee,
i'm
using
a
lot
of
latin
today.
[laughter]
i
would
think
you
would
say
that
even
more
than
usual
there's
obviously
no
justification
in
permitting
tolling.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
provided
for
tolling
by
someone
else,
by
the
secretary.
and
if...
if
you
were
going
to
use
absolute
jurisdictional
limitation
you'd
have
to
say
congress
said
what
it
said
and
no
more
can
be
allowed.
but
we
allowed
more.
justice
scalia
seems
right
to
me.
justice
scalia
mr.
roberts,
with
respect
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
isn't
there
a
statute
on
calculation
of
time
in
the
general
section
of
the
united
states
code
that
says
it?
isn't
there
a
statute
that
says
when...
when--
justice
scalia
--no,
i'm
not
thinking
of
the
rules.
i
thought
there...
well,
all
right,
if
you're
not
aware
of
it,
i--
justice
scalia
doesn't
5
u.s.c.
section...
i've
sent
for
the
book
but
it's
not
here
yet...
section
557
or
something
like
that
say
that
you
don't
have
to
name
the
individual.
you
can
just
name
the
united
states?
i'm
imagining
a
lot
of
codes
sections
this
afternoon
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
i
thought
the
apa
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity--
justice
scalia
it's
standard
in
the
law
that
if
you
give
it
to
my
agent,
you
give
it
to
me.
i
mean,
agency
is
sort
of
an
underlying
background
of
every
law,
isn't
it?
