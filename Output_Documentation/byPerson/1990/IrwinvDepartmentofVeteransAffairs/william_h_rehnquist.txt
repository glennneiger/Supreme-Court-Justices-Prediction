chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
no.
89-5867,
shirley
w.
irwin
against
the
veteran's
administration.
mr.
ker,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kerr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
library
of
congress
v.
shaw,
do
you
cite
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
case
dealing
with
title
vii
as
i
recall,
and
nonetheless
the
court
said
that
when
you're
dealing
with
the
government,
you
don't
necessarily
draw
the
same
inferences
from
language
as
you
do
in
a
law
that
affects
only
private
litigants.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
question
in
that
case
was
whether
they'd
waived
it
and
the
court
said
they
haven't
by
general
language.
and
here
you're
talking
about
general
language
and
the
argument
is
here
if
they
waived
their
immunity
to
the
extent
that
you
are
arguing
for
it
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
page
citation
for
that,
mr.
ker?
if
you
don't--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--okay.
perhaps
you
can
supply
it
later.
chief
justice
rehnquist
479.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
practiced
law
for
16
years--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
it
was
certainly
always
my
assumption,
and
i
think
most
of
my
clients
assumed,
that
when
a
notice
of
an
opinion
or
decision
came
to
my
office
as
a
lawyer
it
was...
came
to
me
as
of
that
time
and
it
came
to
the
client
as
of
that
time.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
specific
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
cases
from
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
said
that
a
lawyer
could
leave
his
office
for
3
months
and
no
effect
would
be
given
to
the
receipt
of
a
no...
a
decision
in
that
office
until
the
lawyer
returned?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is...
is
that
the
import
of
those
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
did
your
client
receive
actual
notice
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
question
isn't
whether
it's
unduly
burdensome
on
the
eeoc.
the
question
is
really
what
the
statute
means.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ker.
mr.
roberts,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
both
cases
held
are
not
jurisdictional.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
roberts,
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
general
basis
for
tolling
statutes
where
tolling
applies?
is
it
things
like
being
out
of
the
jurisdiction,
being
a
minor,
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
that
principle
govern
many
statutes
of
limitations,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
that
if,
say,
to
a
state
tort
says
you
have
to
bring
a
claim
for
personal
injury
in
2
years
after
the
cause
of
action
occurred.
i
come
into
court
2
years
and
10
days
late
and
i
say,
you
know,
i
was
sick
and
i
just...
i
just
couldn't
get
to
a
lawyer
in
time
and
we
did
the
best
we
could.
is
a
state
court
going
to
say,
well,
that's
tolled
for
that
reason?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
it
is
either.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
your
contention
that
you're
justified
in...
you
know
the
language
in
oklahoma
city
against
tull--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--[inaudible]
the
new
rules
that
if
you
don't...
unless
it's
jurisdictional...
if
you
don't
raise
it
in
your
opposition
to
certiorari
we're
entitled
to
disregard
it.
do
you
contend
this
is
jurisdictional?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
doesn't
go
to
this
court's
jurisdiction,
does
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we've
really
been
ill
served
by
the
government
in
this
case
if...
if
that
is
the
proper
disposition
because
we've
invested
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort
in
looking
into
and
examining
the
questions
presented
by
the
petitions
for
certiorari.
did
not
the
government
have
the
opportunity
and
didn't
raise
it
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
ker,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ker.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
89-5867,
irwin
versus
veterans
administration.
this
case
arose
out
of
a
claim
by
the
petitioner
that
he
had
been
unlawfully
fired
by
the
veterans
administration
on
the
basis
of
his
race
and
age.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
notice
to
an
attorney's
office
which
is
not
acknowledged
by
a
representative
of
that
office
qualifies
as
notice
to
the
client
because
petitioner
did
not
file
a
suit
until
44
days
after
his
attorney's
office
received
notice,
his
filing
was
not
timely.
we
also
hold,
however,
that
the
late
filing
did
not
bar
the
district
court
from
exercising
jurisdiction
over
the
case
and
that
statutes
of
limitations
and
actions
against
the
government
are
subject
to
the
same
rebuttal
presumption
of
equitable
tolling
that
applies
to
suits
against
private
defendants.
but
in
this
case,
the
petitioner's
failure
to
file
cannot
be
excused
under
the
equitable
tolling
doctrine.
he
has
simply
a
garden
variety
claim
of
excusable
neglect
which
is
not
the
same
as
equitable
tolling.
so,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
marshall
joins;
justice
stevens
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
souter
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
