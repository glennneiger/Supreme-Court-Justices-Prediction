justice
stevens
the
trouble
with
that
argument
for
me
is
doesn't
it
always
run
into
consideration
of
sovereign
immunity?
because
whenever
you
can
sue
the
government,
you've
had
a
sovereign...
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
justice
stevens
isn't
it
true,
of
course,
in
the
franchised
export
case
involving
the
postal
service
we
took
just
the
opposite
view.
he
said...
we
quoted
some
cases
back
from
the
thirties,
'39
and
'40,
saying
we
always
construe
sovereign
immunity
very
broadly
because
that's
congress'
power.
we've
gone
kind
of
back
and
forth
in
the
issue,
haven't
we?
justice
stevens
the
court
was
much
more
liberal
50
years
ago
i
guess
is
the
answer.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
mr.
roberts,
did
you
raise
this
point
in
your
brief
in
opposition?
justice
stevens
the
real
point
is
we
should
reach
the
questions
we...
i...
like
justice
o'connor,
i'm
getting
mixed
by
this.
[laughter]
i
think
your
real
point
is
we
should
not
address
the
questions
presented
by
the
cert.
petition.
justice
stevens
well,
sometimes
we
said
when
a
respondent
doesn't
raise
a
question
like
this,
we...
we'll
leave
that
open
on
remand
or
something
and
go
ahead
and
address
what
decided
on...
raised
by
the
cert.
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
roberts,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
going
to
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
whether
the
service
is
sufficient
when
made
on
the
lawyer
rather
than
on
the
claimant
personally,
and
ask
you
whether...
if
the
united
states
had
had
a
claim...
one
of
the
problems
is
we've
got
really
a
lawsuit
starting
as
opposed
to
an
administrative
proceeding
up
to
there.
and
if
the
united
states
had
had
a
claim
against
this
individual
that
had
to
be
served,
the
suit
had
to
be
started
within
a
short
period,
could
they
have...
and
they
couldn't
find
him,
could
they
have
gotten
adequate
service
by
serving
his
lawyer?
justice
stevens
when
it's
commencing
the
lawsuit,
then
the
party
himself...
which
lends
a
little
support
to
the
notion
that
this
is
a
kind...
a
little
more
important
than
just
the
normal
notice
of
a
deposition
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
well,
his
litigation
hasn't
even
started
yet.
if
he
didn't
file
in
time,
there's
never
been
any
litigation.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
supposing
he
had
been
terminated,
but
he
just
forgot
to
notify
the
eeoc
and
the
lawyer's...
they've
had
a
total
falling
out
and
the
lawyer's
not
going
to
forward
anything
because
he
didn't
pay
his
bill
or
something
like
that.
it's
still
jurisdictional.
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
they...
in
your
view
they
serve
the
discharged
attorney
and
that
takes
care
of
everything.
justice
stevens
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
i'm
assuming
the
attorney
was
properly
retained
at
the
outset,
then
the
proceeding
drags
along
for
9
or
10
months
and
the
client
gets
dissatisfied
and
fires
him
but
does
not
tell
the
eeoc.
so,
the
appearance
is
still
sitting
in
your
files.
but
nevertheless,
under
your
view,
they
can
serve
the
discharged
attorney
within
the
30-day
period
and
the
attorney
can
tear
it
up
and
throw
it
away
and
the
time
is
right.
justice
stevens
well,
why
not?
justice
stevens
well,
then
how
can
it
be
jurisdictional?
justice
stevens
so,
he
could
have
saved
his
case
by
just
saying,
well,
i'm
sorry
i
fired
that
lawyer.
justice
stevens
as
to
whether
it
was
true
or
not,
but
then
there
would
have
been
jurisdiction
to
go
through
that
proceeding
and
decide.
justice
stevens
under
the
eeoc's
own
rules,
serving
the
lawyer
is
no
substitute
for
serving
the
party.
justice
stevens
well,
it
isn't.
they
can't
under
their
own
rule
omit
serving
the
party,
giving
notice
to
the
party.
they
say
give
it
to
both
of
them.
they
can't...
they
can't,
under
their
own
rule,
omit
sending
the
notice
to
the
party.
