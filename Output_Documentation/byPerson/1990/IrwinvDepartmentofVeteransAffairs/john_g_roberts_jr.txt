mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
717(c)
of
title
vii
authorizes
a
federal
employee
who
is
dissatisfied
with
the
eeoc's
disposition
of
his
claim
of
employment
discrimination
to
sue
the
head
of
his
agency
or
department,
"within
30
days
of
receipt
of
notice
of
final
action
taken.
"
by
the
eeoc.
petitioner
urges
this
court
to
imply
an
exception
to
that
provision
so
that
in
some
circumstances
the
employee
may
file
his
lawsuit
more
than
30
days
after
receipt
of
notice.
the
fifth
circuit
below,
in
a
unanimous
opinion
by
judge
higginbotham,
ruled
that
the
30-day
period
set
by
congress
was
a
jurisdictional
limitation
that
was
not
subject
to
judicial
enlargement.
that
decision
should
be
affirmed.
the
federal
government--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
cases
are
inconsistent.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
choose
between
bowen
and
soriano.
my
brother
relies
heavily
on
bowen
in
his
reply
brief.
he
quotes
the
statute
at
issue
in
that
case
thus:
the
social
security
claimant
may
maintain
a
civil
action,
quote,
within
60
days
after
the
mailing
to
him
of
notice
of
such
decision,
dot,
dot,
dot,
period,
end
quote.
he
notes
that
the
court
in
bowen
held
that
that
period
was
tollable
and
then
says
that
that
language
is
virtually
identical
to
the
language
at
issue
in
this
case.
but
it's
only
virtually
identical
by
virtue
of
the
ellipses.
what
the
statutes
actually
provides
is
the
suit
may
be
filed,
quote,
within
60
days
after
the
mailing
to
him
of
mailing
to
him
of
notice
of
such
decision
or
within
such
further
time
as
the
secretary
may
allow.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
bowen--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i
think
that
would
be
a
non
sequitur.
the--
[laughter]
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
language
that
was
deleted
from
petitioner's
quotation
showed,
as
the
court
noted
in
bowen
that
congress
itself
in
the
statute
waiving
sovereign
immunity,
had
expressly
provided
for
tolling
in
certain
circumstances
and
therefore
it
was
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
60-day
period
was
not
an
absolute
jurisdictional
bar.
no
similar
language
appears
in
title
vii.
the
language
in
title
vii
is
unambiguous:
within
30
days
of
receipt
of
notice.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
the
government
wasn't
involved,
of
course,
it
would
be
the
90-day
time
period
for
private
employees.
the
court
seems
to
have
held
that
it
is
jurisdictional
in
two
footnotes
in
two
different
cases,
and
that's...
doesn't
detract
from
the
government's
position,
because
our
case
hinges
on
the
applicability
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
yes,
not
jurisdictional.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
a
different
that
congress
noted.
and
the
difference...
it's
the
parallel
that
petitioner
seeks
to
draw.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
what
applies
in
the
case
of
a
private
employee.
congress
intended
to
treat
them
the
same.
therefore,
the
tolling
should
apply
in
the
case
of
the
federal
employee.
but
this
court
has
consistently
rejected
that
parallel
when
it
has
bumped
up
against
considerations
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
language
is
perfectly
correct
and
as
noted
in
the
zipes
case
in
the
private
sector
and
it's
traditionally
true.
it
is
not
traditionally
true
in
cases
in
which
the
time
limit
is
a
condition
on
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
bowen
is
a
different
case.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
bowen
case?
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
think
the
distinguishing
factor
in
bowen
is
that
there
congress
itself
in
the
statute
had
provided
for
tolling
of
the
limitations
period
and,
therefore,
this
court
concluded
it
could
not
be
regarded
as
an
absolute
jurisdictional
limitation.
here,
in
title
vii--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
government's
argument
in
bowen
was
to
that
effect.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
distinction
is
that
congress,
which
has...
it's
an
interpretation
of
congressional
intent
in
each
case.
and
in
bowen
the
statute
at
issue...
congress
had
provided
for
some
tolling
under
some
circumstances.
and
this
court
determined
that
that
meant
that
there
may
be
other
circumstances
in
which
tolling
would
be
appropriate
as
well.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
honor,
that
distinction
is
there,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
distinction
that
makes
a
difference.
i
think
that
type
of
language
has
more
to
do
with
the
legal
rhetoric
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed.
there
are
many
statutes
and
rules
that
are
unquestionably
jurisdictional
that
don't
have
the
shall
be
forever
barred
language.
this
court's
rule
about
the
time
to
petition
for
cert.,
the
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
governing
the
time
to
appeal...
it
doesn't
say
you
must
appeal
within
30
days
and
the
appeal
will
be
forever
barred
if
you
don't.
it
just
says
you
may...
shall
file
your
notice
of
appeal
within
30
days.
this
provision,
which
is
similar
to
a
notice
of
appeal...
after
all,
it's
coming
after
an
agency
determination...
we
think
is
as
jurisdictional
as
that
other
provision.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they've
been
interpreted...
an
eleventh
circuit
case
has
held
that
that
was
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
specified
the
time
period
to
incorporate
the
normal
rules
about
what
to
do
when
the
last
day
falls
on
a
sunday.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
of
the
consideration
of
sovereign
immunity
and
the
case
that
justice
o'connor
noted,
the
soriano
case,
which
says
you
do
not
imply
the
time
limits
set
in
statutes
waivering
sovereign
immunity
are
subject
to
tolling.
and
that's
true
even
if
the
time
period
is
subject
to
tolling
when
suit
is
not
against
the
united
states.
that's
the
holding
of
the
soriano
case,
involved
claims
by
philippine
citizens
for
furnishing
goods
to
the
united
states
forces
that
was
filed
after
the
applicable
6-year
period
of
limitations.
the
claimant
said
the
period
should
be
tolled
during
the
dependency
of
hostilities.
and
they
cited
private
sector
cases.
this
court
dismissed
those
cases,
saying
they
don't
apply
here
because
here
you
have
to
take
into
account
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
there's
a
provision
in
the
federal
rules
that
so
provides.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
provision
of
the
federal
rules
is
the
only
one
i
know
of.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
my
understanding
of
equitable
tolling
is
the...
a
diligent
effort
to
comply
with
the
time
period
and
failure
to
do
so
through
no
fault
of
your
own.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
as
the
court
noted
in
hallstrom
and
in
bowen,
it
traditionally
applies
when...
at
least
when
suits...
it
doesn't
involved
considerations
of
sovereign
immunity.
but
i'd
point
out
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
adequate
either.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
there's
nothing
here
on
this
record
to
indicate
that
there
would
be
any
equitable
tolling
of
the
statute
at
all.
petitioner
left
his
law
office
without
arrangements
for
handling
time-sensitive
matters
that
may
come
in
and
returned
and
still
had
plenty
of
time,
12
days,
to
meet
the
statutory
deadline
and
yet...
and
yet
failed
to
do
so.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
basis
for
equitable
tolling
here.
and
there
certainly
is
no
basis
for
waiver.
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
promptly
in
the
district
court.
and
as
far
as
estoppel,
there
is
no
estoppel
against
the
government.
and
even
if
there
were,
there's
no
showing
of
any
affirmative
misconduct
that
would
justify
it.
the
eeoc
did
everything
it
was
supposed
to
do.
it
sent
the
notice
to
the
claimant
and
to
the
lawyer
he
had
designated
to
handle
this
matter
for
him.
so,
there
is
no
basis
for
estoppel,
no
basis
for
waiver,
nor
for
equitable
tolling.
but
more
importantly,
as
i've
indicated,
certainly
congress
intended
to
treat
federal
employees
and
private
sector
employees
the
same.
but
as
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
and
consistently,
when
that
parallel
runs
into
considerations
of
sovereign
immunity,
an
express
waiver
of
immunity
is
required.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
for
example,
in
the
chandler
case,
the
issue
was
what
type
of
a
trial
do
you
get
when
you
file
your
lawsuit.
i
don't
think
considerations
of
sovereign
immunity
were
implicated
there
in
terms
of
whether
it
was
a
trial
de
novo
or
administrative
review.
here,
however,
the
issue
is
whether
the
suit
can
be
brought
at
all
beyond
the
time
period
that
congress
had
specified.
and
their
considerations
of
sovereign
immunity
are
paramount,
as
they
were
in
the
shaw
case,
for
example.
the
court
had
previously
held
private
parties
were
entitled
to
an
award
of
interest
on
attorneys'
fees.
congress
intended
to
treat
the
united
states
like
a
private
employer.
therefore,
the
argument
was
made
that
united
states
should
be
liable
for
interests
on
attorneys'
fees.
the
court
rejected
the
parallel,
noting
that
considerations
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
no
interest
rule,
required
an
express
waiver.
the
same
result
in
brown
v.
gsa.
the
court
has
previously
held
that
title
vii
was
not
the
exclusive
remedy
for
private
employment
discrimination.
the
argument
was
made
congress
intended
the
united
states
to
be
treated
like
a
private
employer
and
rejected
it,
justice
stewart
noting
for
the
court
that
those
private
cases
did
not
involve
sovereign
immunity.
to
cite
just
one
more
example,
lehman
against
nakshian.
the
court
had
previously
had
held
that
under
the
age
discrimination
act,
private
sector
employees
had
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
when
congress
extended
the
protections
of
that
act
to
federal
employees,
modeled
after
title
vii,
it
intended
to
treat
federal
employees
that
same.
therefore,
the
argument
was
made
that
federal
employees
should
have
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
the
court
rejected
the
argument,
noting
that
sovereign
immunity
required
an
express
waiver
of
the
government's
immunity
from
jury
trial.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
50
years
ago
was
when
it
decided
the
soriano
case,
which
is
i
think
as
i've
indicated
perhaps
the
strongest
support
on
the
precise
question
that
petitioner
seeks
to
raise,
the
tolling
of
statutes
of
limitations.
now--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
it's
at
the
executive--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--correct.
and
the
court
emphasized
in
the
soriano
case
that
the
court
had
no
authority
to
enforce
relief
against
the
sovereign
beyond
the
limits
set
by
congress
and
that
in
this
area
as
no
other,
congress
is
entitled
to
assume
when
it
set
a
time
period,
that
it
meant
that
time
period
and
not
a
longer
one.
now,
my
brother
points
to
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says
the
federal
employees
may
bring
an
action
as
provided
in
section
2000e-5
where
the
private
action
is
authorized.
but
nothing
in
2000e-5
authorizes
the
tolling
of
statute...
statutes
of
limitations.
and,
in
fact,
this
would
seem
to
be
the
one
provision
that
you
would
not
look
to
subsection
5
for,
because
there's
a
different
provision
here.
congress
it
self
has
expressly
distinguished
between
the
federal
sector
and
the
private
sector:
30
days
for
the
federal
employee,
90
for
the
private
sector
employee.
so,
that
would
be
the
one
area
you
would
not
look
back
to
the
other
section.
now,
on
the
second
question
presented,
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
normal
rule
should
apply
and
that
notice
to
an
attorney
that
one
has
designated
to
handle
his
affairs
in
a
particular
manner
constitutes
notice
to
the
claimant
himself.
here,
the
eeoc
did
what
the
petitioner
asked
him
to
do,
sent
notice
to
his...
designated
counsel
of
record.
notice
was
accepted
at
the
offices
of
the
designated
counsel
of
record
by
an
employee
authorized
to
do
so.
that's
when
the
30-day
period
began
to
run,
not
the
later
time
when
the
notice
was
actually
received
by
the
employee
or
the
still
later
time
when
petitioner's
counsel
actually
read
the
notice.
this
court
doesn't
have
to
envision
hypotheticals
to
understand
how
unworkable
a
rule
would
be
that
depended
upon
when
the
lawyer
actually
read
the
notice.
it
has
pending
before
it
a
case
in
which
the
lawyer
acknowledged
receipt
of
the
notice
on
a
june
22d
and
then
claims
she
didn't
read
it
until
a
couple
of
days
later
and
that
the
time
should
begin
to
run
from
that
later
period.
that
would
be
an
entirely
unworkable
rule
for
triggering
the
jurisdictional
period.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
honor,
in
fact
the
eeoc
has
a
regulation
warning
claimants
that
if
they're
going
to
be...
if
they're
going
to
be
a
prolonged
absence
from
the
residence,
the
address
they've
given
them,
to
notify
the
eeoc
precisely
for
that
contingency.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
that
case
the
eeoc
would
be
sure
not
to
send
a
notice
until
the
prolonged
absence
was
over,
or
the
claimant
could
make
other
arrangements
for
handling
the
matter
if
his
lawyer
was
going
to
be
absence
from
the
country.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
regulation,
which
is
29
c.f.r.
1607,
a
subsection
of
that,
speaks
in
terms
of
claimants.
it
says
that
claimant
should
provide
his
address
to
the
eeoc,
any
change
of
address...
which
was
not
done
in
this
case...
and
any
prolonged
absences
that
he
anticipates.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
have
information
on
that,
your
honor.
what
i
do
know
is
that
it's...
more
claimants
are
represented
at
the
later
stages
than
at
the
early
stages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
later
stage.
actually
this
claimant
was
represented
from
prior
to
the
initiation
of
the
administrative
process.
and
as
the
district
court
noted...
my
brother
made
some
point
about
the
danger
of
people
not
having
the
same
lawyer.
the
district
court
noted
that
there
was
no
dispute
here,
that
petitioner's
counsel
represented
petitioner
throughout
the
litigation.
this
was
petitioner's
lawyer.
any
question
of
what
to
do
after
the
lawyer
receives
notice
is
a
matter
between
the
client
and
his
lawyer
and
shouldn't
affect
the
triggering
of
the
jurisdictional
period.
now,
in
fact,
the
court
need
not
reach
the
question
of
when
the
time
period
began
to
run
because
either...
under
either
the
view
of
the
united
states
that
it
began
when
the
notice
was
received
at
petitioner's
counsel's
office
and
accepted
by
someone
authorized
to
accept
it,
or
under
petitioner's
view
that
it
begins
only
on
a
later
day
when
the
claimant
himself
receives
suit,
this
lawsuit
is
still
jurisdictionally
out
of
time,
because
petitioner
has
never
named
the
only
proper
defendant
under
title
vii,
which
is
the
administrator
of
the
veterans'
administration.
nor
has
he
provided
notice
to
that
defendant
within
the
30-day
period.
the
statute
on
this
point
could
not
be
clearer.
it
specifies
that
in
the
civil
action
that's
authorized,
quote,
the
head
of
the
department,
agency,
or
unit
as
appropriate
shall
be
the
defendant,
end
quote.
and
the
notice
that
was
received
both
by
petitioner's
counsel
and
by
petitioner
himself
went
overboard
in
emphasizing
this
fact,
reading
from
the
joint
appendix
on
page
5.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
did
not,
your
honor.
we
should
have.
we
did
raise
it
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
did
not
decide
it.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
the
court
can,
but
it...
there
is
this
alternative
basis
which
it
could
reach
which
it
wouldn't
have
to
consider
what
the
triggering
event
is.
i
don't
know
which
would
be
in
the
exercise
of
discretion--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
and
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
this
question
if
it
agrees
with
the
united
states
that
the
30-day
period
is
jurisdictional
and
that
time
began
to
run
when
the
notice
was
sent
to
petitioner's...
received
by
petitioner's
counsel.
i
simply
point
it
out
because
it
is
a
jurisdictional
bar.
it
is
a
condition
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
just
like
the
time
period.
and
it's
clearly
not
been
complied
with
in
this
case.
and
the
notice,
as
i
was
saying,
is...
is
unambiguous.
in
reading
in
joint
appendix,
page
5,
if
you
file
a
civil
action,
and
this
part
is
in
bold
face,
you
must
name
the
appropriate
official
agency
or
department
head
as
the
defendant.
failure
to
provide
the
name
or
official
title,
again
in
bold
face,
of
the
agency
head
or
where
appropriate
the
department
head,
may
result
in
the
loss
of
any
judicial
redress
to
which
you
may
be
entitled.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
explain
that
the
agency
here
is
the
national
organization,
not
the
local
unit.
petitioner
has
never
named
the
administrator
of
the
veteran's
administration
in
either
his
original
complaint
or
his
amended
complaint.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
for
the
same
reason
the
time
limitation
is.
it's
a
condition
on
the
waiver
on
sovereign
immunity
and
there
only
congress
can
waive
that
condition.
as
i
said,
we
should
have
raised
it
in
our
brief
and
opposition
and
did
not,
but
i
do
think
it
is
jurisdictional
and
can
be
raised
at
any
time.
it
clearly
was
not
satisfied
in
this
case.
the
administrator--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
it
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
any
court
to
entertain
this
action.
the
congress
has
waived
the
sovereign
immunity
for
this
title
vii
action
only
with
respect
to
actions
against
the
head
of
the
department
or
agency,
no
other.
and
that
is
a
jurisdictional
bar,
as
justice
stone
noted
in
a
waiver
of
a
condition
case--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
under
a
number
of
rationales.
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
the
period
is
jurisdictional
and
agrees
with
us
further
that
it
begins
to
run
when
the
designated
counsel
of
record--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
it
shouldn't
have.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
did
raise
it
in
the
district
court.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
did
not
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
time
expended
is
in
any
sense
but
wasted.
the
court
still
must
reach
the
first
the
question
presented,
which
is
whether
the
30-day
period
is
jurisdictional
or
not,
and
it
can
go
on
to
reach
the
question
of
what
triggers
the
running
of
that
event.
i
simply
bring
this
other
point
up
to
note
that
the
court
need
not
reach
that
issue
and
can
decide
it
on
this
alternative
basis.
the
court
can
certainly
decide
on
the
other
basis
as
well.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
section.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
may
well,
but
it
doesn't
apply
in
this
case,
because
this
suit
is
not
brought
under
the
apa,
and
in
light
of
brown
v.
gsa,
could
not
be
brought
under
the
apa.
the
provision
that's
applicable
here
on
that
question
is
rule
15(c)
which
governs
relation
back
which
says
you
can
amend
to
add
a
new
party
if
that
party
received
notice
in
the
period
provided
by
law
for
commencing
the
action
against
it.
it
was
not
the
case
here.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
believe
rule
4
requires
that
the
party
itself,
when
the
initial
commencement
of
the
lawsuit--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
stage
in
an
ongoing
litigation.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
notice
is
not
coming
from
the
party
that
is
commencing
the
action.
the
notice
is
coming
from
the
adjudicatory
body.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
a
more
apt
analogy
would
be
sort
of
an
arbitration,
and
the
arbiter's
notice
is
then
sent
out
rather
than
one
of
the
parties
that's
commencing
the
lawsuit.
and
in
that
situation,
as
here,
i
think
notice
to
the
individual,
the
attorney
that's
been
designated
by
the
party
as
his
attorney
is
sufficient
to--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
terms
of...
well,
in
terms
of
ongoing
litigation,
federal
rule
5.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
sends
notice
to
the
claimant
and
his
designated
represented.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
it's
in...
it's
in
the
eeoc
regulations.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
eeoc
regulation
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
we
will
send
notice
to
the
claimant
and,
if
he's
designated
a
representative,
to
the
designated
representative.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
provides
for
notice
for
both.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
what
starts--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
they
send
notice
to
both.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
not
and
suppose
that's
designed
to
take--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
attorneys
may
be
discharged
or
they
change
lawyers
and
they
should
notify
the
eeoc
of
that.
issues
can
arise
as
to
whether
the
attorney-client
relationship
is
still
ongoing
or
was
established.
no
question
of
that
in
this
case.
petitioner--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i...
notice
to
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
notice
to
the
party's
attorney
is
notice
to
the
party.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
been
the
position
of
the
united
states,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
our
position
that
the
attorney-client
privilege
must
still
be
ongoing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
we
have
not
given
notice
that...
the
jurisdictional
period
begins
to
run
upon
receipt
of
notice,
and
if
the
party
has
fired
his
lawyer...
he's
no
longer
his
lawyer.
notice
to
that
lawyer
can't
be
considered
notice
to
the
party.
but
there
is
no
question
of
that
sort
here.
petitioner's
counsel
has
represented
him
throughout
this...
this
litigation.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
no,
there
would
have
been
a
hearing
in
the
district
court--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
determine
when
the
notice
began
to
run.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
the
eeoc's
rule--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you,
your
honor.
