justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
concerns
the
period
of
limitations
applicable
to
a
federal
suit
or
alleged
misrepresentations
in
violation
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
rule
10b-5
thereunder.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
defendants
on
the
ground
that
the
complaints
were
not
timely
filed.
and
it
ruled
that
oregon's
2-year
limitations
periods
for
fraud
claims
governed.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
accepted
oregon's
limitations
period
but
it
found
that
there
were
unresolved
factual
issues
as
to
when
the
plaintiffs
should
have
discovered
the
alleged
fraud.
we
reverse
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
litigation
of
this
kind
must
be
begun
within
one
year
after
the
discovery
of
the
facts
and
within
three
years
after
such
violation.
we
conclude
that
neither
the
5-year
period
contained
in
the
'34
act's
insider
trading
provision,
added
in
1988,
nor
state
law
fraud
provides
a
closer
and
better
analogy.
the
limitations
period
is
not
subject
to
the
doctrine
of
equitable
tolling.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
earliest
of
the
plaintiffs'
complaints
was
filed
more
than
three
years
after
the
alleged
misrepresentations.
and
thus,
the
claims
were
untimely.
