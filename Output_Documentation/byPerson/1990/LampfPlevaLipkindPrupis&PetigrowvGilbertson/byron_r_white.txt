true
that
the...
is
it
the
insider
trading
act
of
'88
that
the
commission
relies
on?
justice
white
well,
isn't
it
true
that
that...
that's
the
only
time
that
there,
that
congress
has
provided
a
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
a
cause
of
action
that
can
be...
involve
10(b)?
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
that...
well,
anyway,
it's
right.
justice
white
well,
tell
me
when
it
isn't
right.
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
that's
true,
that's
true.
but
i
still
ask...
you
can
bring
a
cause
of
action
under
that
'88
act
that
involves
a
violation
of
10(b).
justice
white
and
there
is
then
an
express
statute
of
limitations
for
it.
justice
white
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
with
that,
but
it
does
involve
10(b).
justice
white
why
shouldn't...
why
isn't
that
the
closest
statute
that
we
should
look
to?
justice
white
so...
so
you
suggest
we
have...
there
are
two...
you
suggest
two
statutes
of
limitations
that
would
be...
that
would
apply
this...
different
10(b)
actions?
one
that
involves
the
'88
act,
and
for
all
others
there
would
be
this
other
statute
of
limitations?
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
are
you
going
to...
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
whether
the
state
law
should
apply.
what's
your
argument
with
respect
to
what
the
statute
of
limitations
should
be
in
that
event?
