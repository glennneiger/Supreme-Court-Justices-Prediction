justice
scalia
mr.
olson,
these
are
problems
that
always
exist
whenever
you
borrow
state
statutes
of
limitations,
but
we've
been
doing
it
for
a
couple
of
hundred
years.
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
it's
always
better
to
make
up
or
pick
a
federal
statute
of
limitations.
is
that
always
true?
justice
scalia
have
you
read
the
law
of
conflict
of
laws
recently?
i
mean,
from
the
standpoint
of
a
lawyer
figuring
out
what
substantive
law
is
going
to
govern
his
case,
i
don't
know
that
securities
law
is
any
more
difficult
than
any
other
field
for
determining
what
substantive
law
the
particular
court
is
going
to
apply.
justice
scalia
has
anyone
sought
to
get
legislation
from
congress?
congress
does
have
the
power
to
pass
statutes
of
limitation.
why
didn't
that
occur
to
anybody?
i
mean,
if
there
is
as
much
upset
about
it,
if
everybody
is
in
agreement
as
you
say,
it
ought
to
be
a
simple
thing
to
get
a
statute.
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
there
isn't
that
much
agreement.
justice
scalia
we
weren't
moved,
evidently,
by
the
fact
that
whenever
congress
wanted
a
cause
of
action
it
adopted
a
statute
of
limitations
for
it.
that
didn't
seem
to
influence
us.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
say
every
other,
every
instance
in
that
statute
where
congress
created
a
private
right
of
action,
it
enacted
a
statute
of
limitations
for
that
cause
of
action,
right?
justice
scalia
but
we
found
that
congress
really
had
in
mind
another
cause
of
action
without
a
statute
of
limitations.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
can
say
we
looked
to
it,
but
have
we
really
used
it?
has
that
been
our
guiding,
our
guiding
star,
what
the
73d
congress
wanted?
justice
scalia
mr.
olson,
were...
are
there
any
other
overlaps
in
the
1988
statute?
does
that
limitation
period
cover
any
other
actions
that
are
governed
by
another
federal
statute
of
limitations?
justice
scalia
which
already
have
their
own
statute
of
limitations?
justice
scalia
so
it
wouldn't
be
at
all
unusual
for
that
1988
statute
to
duplicate
the
1
and
3-year
statute
that
you're
arguing
for,
it
already
duplicates
other
ones?
justice
scalia
as
it
is
where
it's
used
elsewhere
in
the
federal
securities
acts.
justice
scalia
even
if
you
showed
fraud
it
would
do
you
no
good.
you'd
still
be
subject
to
the
3
years,
wouldn't
you?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
is
there
always
intentional
fraud
in
a
10b-5
violation?
justice
scalia
--suppose
2
years
from
now
congress
passes
yet
another
statute
that
is
even
closer?
i
suppose
we
jump
over
to
that
one
then,
right?
i
mean,
this
is
an
ongoing
looking,
scanning
the
united
states
code
for
the
closest
friend,
right?
justice
scalia
of
course
that
problem
of
jumping
from
statute
to
statute
is,
i
suppose,
an
argument
for
mr.
olson's
position
of
sticking
with
the
limitations
from
the
statute
that
this
cause
of
action
is
derived
from.
i
mean,
there
is
never
going
to
be
another
73d
congress.
justice
scalia
but
your
opponent
says
that
those
were
not
fraud
actions.
