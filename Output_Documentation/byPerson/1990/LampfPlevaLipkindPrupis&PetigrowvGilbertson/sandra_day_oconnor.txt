justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
olson,
in
the
judicial
improvements
act
passed
a
year
ago,
congress
did
adopt
a
general
4-year
statute
of
limitation,
but
apparently
limited
it
to
acts
enacted
after
the
enactment
of
the
4-year
statute
of
limitations
provision.
justice
o'connor
in
other
words,
they
didn't
seek
to
apply
it--
justice
o'connor
--to
previous
enactments
or
causes
of
actions.
now,
why
was
that?
i
mean,
why,
why
so
limit
it?
justice
o'connor
for
all
future
acts
of
congress,
unless
they
provide
otherwise
expressly.
justice
o'connor
well,
maybe
that
should
be
a
guidepost
in
this
case.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
considered
some...
a
limitation
period
for
those
causes
of
action
that
congress
expressly
created.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
it
considered
what
the
cause...
statute
of
limitations
should
be
for
a
cause
of
action
implied
by
the
courts.
justice
o'connor
mr.
allen--
--mr.
allen...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
allen,
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
we
were
to
apply
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
and
were
to
apply
the
1-year/3-year
statute
of
limitations,
that
there
could
never
be
any
equitable
tolling
of
that
3-year
period?
is
that
the
position
you
want
to
take
here?
justice
o'connor
have
we
held
that?
justice
o'connor
not
yet.
mr.
allen,
how
does
this
work,
i
mean,
when
we
pick
a
federal
statute?
you
have
described
one
that
you
say
well,
it's
pretty
close
to
10b-5.
suppose--
