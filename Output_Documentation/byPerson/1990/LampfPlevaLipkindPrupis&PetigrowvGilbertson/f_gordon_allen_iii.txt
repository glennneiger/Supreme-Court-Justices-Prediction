mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
10(b)
and
rule
10b-5,
private
rights
of
action,
will
continue
to
have
proper
fraud
statutes
of
limitations,
statutes
of
limitations
which
are
discovery
based,
or
whether
this
court
will
impose
upon
this
antifraud
remedy
a
3-year
statute
of
repose.
and
that
is
what
we're
talking
about
here,
a
3-year
statute
of
repose
which
will,
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
bailey
v.
glover
in
1875,
cited
frequently
since
then,
which
statute
of
repose
will,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
become
the
means
by
which
fraud
can
be
successfully
accomplished.
the--
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
--the
other
federal
securities
acts
are
not
antifraud
remedies.
at
the
time
the
73d
congress
enacted
the
3-year
statute
of
repose
for
those
other
sections,
the
little
legislative
history
that
we
have
on
the
subject
tells
us
that
a
political
tradeoff
was
made
whereby
a
short
statute
of
repose
was
put
on
the
acts,
but
the
proponents
of
that
short
statute
of
repose
argued
that
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
plaintiffs
would
be
so
low
they
are
basically
strict
liability
causes
of
action
with
the
defense
of
good
faith
available,
that
the
burden
on
the
plaintiffs
would
be
so
low
that
a
short
statute
of
limitations
was
justified.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
under
the
express
remedies?
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
yes.
but
those
are
different
remedies.
it's
sort
of
like...
those
are
remedies,
they
are
strict
liability
remedies.
the
fact
that
someone
who
is
liable
under
those
remedies
may
also
have
committed
fraud,
in...
in
many
cases
may
be
a
coincidence,
but
fraud
is
not
a
necessary
element
of
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
no,
your
honor,
most
courts
hold
that
recklessness
is
also
sufficient,
but
they
do
not
hold
that
negligence
is
sufficient
or
that
there
are
strict
liability
causes
of
action.
and
the
instruction
which
is
given
for
recklessness,
as
i
can
testify
as
plaintiff's
lawyer,
is
exceedingly
onerous.
it
comes
so
close
to
fraud
that
it
is
all
but
fraud.
furthermore,
we
should
not
be
looking
at
the
intent
of
the
73d
congress
in
any
specific
way.
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions,
bankers
life,
blue
chip
stamps,
herman
&
maclean,
basic
inc.,
aaron
v.
sec,
this
court
has
always
looked
at
section
10(b)
as
a
catch-all
antifraud
remedy,
congress'
invitation
to
the
sec
and
maybe
the
courts
in
the
future
to
fashion
flexible
antifraud
remedies
that
would
match
the
evolution
of
securities
fraud.
those
antifraud
remedies
have
been
developed
in
the
sixties
and
the
seventies
and
the
eighties,
in
this
court
in
the
seventies
and
the
eighties.
they
are
broad
remedies,
and
to
now
shoehorn
them
back
into
the
intent
of
congress
with
the
result
of
imposing
a
statute
of
repose,
a
3-year
statute
of
repose,
would
be
a
mistake.
it
is
too
easy
for
promoters
to
figure
out
how
to
conceal
their
frauds
for
3
years.
this
court
has,
is
certainly
aware
of
ponzi
schemes
whereby
promoters
are
able
to
feed
back
proceeds
from
later
investors
to
earlier
investors.
there
are
all
kinds
of
accounting
schemes
whereby
corporate
executives
and
accountants
can
monkey
with
the
books
and
go
under...
undiscovered
for
years.
the
bond
investors
who
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
here
present
a
particularly
compelling
situation.
they
tell
us
that
securities
fraud...
they
tell
us
that
the
average
municipal
bond
which
is
unregistered
and
has
no
remedy
except
10b-5,
the
average
municipal
bond
will
not
default
for
4
and
a
half
years,
then
investors
will
have
no
idea
that
they
have
been
defrauded
until
there
has
been
a
default.
and
the
result
of
a
3-year
statute
of
repose
is
going
to
mean
that
the
only
federal,
the
only
federal
remedy
for
securities
fraud
available
to
bondholders
will
not
apply
in
more
than
half
of
the
cases
where
there
is
fraud.
now,
the
respondents
would
like
to
make
three
points.
first,
under
your
tests
in
delcostello
and
malley-duff,
it
is
still
the
norm,
it
is
still
the
rule
for
this
court
to
borrow
state
statutes
of
limitations,
and
there
is
nothing
about
the
borrowing
of
state
statutes
of
limitations
which
has
frustrated
or
interfered
with
federal
policy,
and
state...
and
the
state
statutes
from
which
these
statutes
of
limitations
are
taken,
common
law
fraud
and
blue
sky
statutes
of...
blue
sky
statutes,
are
at
least
as
analogous
to
10(b)
and
section
10b-5
as
are
the
federal
alternatives
that
are
being
proposed.
no
interference,
just
as
analogous.
the
second
point
we
are...
we
want
to
make
is
that
this
court
should
reaffirm
its
holdings
in
bailey
v.
glover
and
holmberg
v.
armbrecht
that
a
statute
of
limitations
for
fraud
is...
it
is
particularly
important
that
a
statute
of
limitations
for
fraud
be
discovery
based,
that
it
be
tollable,
that
is
that
it
not
start
to
run
until
the
plaintiff
either
discovers
or
should
have
discovered
that
he
or
she
has
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
third
point
we
want
to
make
is
that
recent
congressional
action
and
inaction
in
the
face
of
the
evolution
of
section
10(b)
and
rule
10b-5,
particularly
where
congress
has
turned
its
attention
to
the
securities
laws
on
a
number
of
occasions
to
examine
them
for
problems,
that
recent
inaction
and
ratification
by
congress
is
of
much
more
significance
than
the
intent
of
the
73d
congress,
an
intent
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
only
of
the
most
general
nature,
and
an
intent
which
invited
the
future
to
fashion
remedies
that
would
deal
with
the
evolving
nature
of
securities
fraud.
that
is
what
you've
said.
now
the
respondents
make
a
big
point
of
the
lack
of
uniformity.
this
lack
of
uniformity
as
a
problem
has
been
only
recently
perceived
by
three
circuit
courts.
prior
to
that,
it
is
hard
to
find
examples
of
problems
arising
because
of
the
use
of
statutes...
borrowed
state
statutes,
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that.
the
reason
is
because
the
federal
courts
have
imposed
the
rule
of
holmberg
v.
armbrecht
whenever
they
have
borrowed
state
statutes
of
limitations.
that
is
they
have
borrowed
the
duration
from
state
law,
but
they
have
insisted
that
whatever
that
duration
they
borrowed
was,
that
it
not
start
until
discovery.
so
the
result
is
that
whatever
the
duration
has
been,
it
has
been
of
minor
significance
because
plaintiffs
have
been
allowed...
because
it
has
not
start
to
run
until
plaintiffs
discover
their
cause
of
action.
so
the
result
has
been
that
plaintiffs
bring
their
causes
of
action
very
quickly--
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
--i'm
not
following
you.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
it's
right.
i
think
they
are
borrowing
the
state
statute--
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
--they
are...
well,
they
have
never
acknowledged
that
they
were
borrowing
part
of
it.
they
have
borrowed
the
state
statute
of
limitations
subject
to
the
federal
doctrine
from
this
court
that
it
not
start
until
the
plaintiff
discovered
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
holmberg
v.
armbrecht.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
i
think
it
was,
yes.
i
think
that
justice
frankfurter
made
a
fairly
complete
and...
rule
without
exception
that
this
court
in
borrowing
state
statutes
of
limitations
would
do
the
same
thing
that
it
also
does
when
acting
upon
federal
statutes
of
limitations,
most
federal
statutes
of
limitations,
and
that
is
that
they
not
start
to
run
until
the
plaintiff
discovers
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
all
right.
first
of
all,
it
should
not
be
a
3-year
statute
of
repose.
i
think
you
have
heard
me
say
that.
second
of
all,
we
believe
that
the
situation
presented
by
the
relationship,
by
the...
between
the
interstate
land
sales
act
and
the
securities
acts
is
very
similar
to
the
situation
that
you
encountered
in
the
malley-duff
case
in
examining
the
relationship
between
the
clayton
act
and
rico.
what
you
had
in
the
relationship
between
the
clayton
act
and
rico
was
that
you
had
a
subsequent
statute,
rico,
which
you
found
had
been
very
much
patterned
after
the
language
and
the
concept
of
the
clayton
act.
and
so
you
said
that
this
is
the
best
indication
of
what
federal
policy
should
be
in
a
statute
of
limitations
for
rico.
now
look
at
the
interstate
land
sales
act.
in
the
late
sixties,
in
1968
or
'69,
congress
passed
a
remedy
for
people
who
are
cheated
by
the
sales
through
the
mails
and
over
the
telephone
of
land
in
sunny
climates
and
the
like,
investment
properties.
and
what
congress
did
was
to
enact
a
remedy
which
sort
of
sat
between
a
12-2
remedy
in
the
securities
laws
and
a
10b-5
remedy
in
the
securities
law,
but
congress
did
say
that
it
was
intending
to
pattern
this
after
the
securities
laws.
what
it
did
10
years
later,
though,
is
what
is
compelling
about
this
analogy,
because
10
years
later
it
decided
to
make
the
interstate
land
sales
act
more
like
the
securities
act.
it
decided
to
divide
out
a
12-2
remedy,
a
strict
liability-type
remedy...
12-2
of
the
1933
act
is
what
i
am
referring
to.
they
decided
to
divide
out
a
12-2
remedy,
and
they
decided
to
divide
out
a
10b-5
remedy.
and
they
made
that
10b-5
remedy
identical,
or
practically
identical,
to
rule
10b-5
in
the
securities
acts,
and
once
again
they
said
our
intention
here
is
to
pattern
this
after
the
securities
acts.
then
what
did
they
do
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations?
they
took
a
3-year
statute
of
repose
and
put
it
on
the
12-2
remedy,
the
73d
congress,
and
then
they
took
a
3-year
from
discovery,
a
discovery-based
statute
of
limitations,
and
put
it
on
the
10b-5
remedy
for
10b-5.
look
at
what
else
congress
has
done.
congress,
when
they
enacted
the
residual
statute
of
limitations
in
the
judicial
reform
act,
section
313,
enacted
a
4-year
statute
of
limitations
based
upon
accrual.
under
the
holdings
of
the
federal
courts
that
notion
of
accrual
will
probably
also
turn
out
to
be
discovery
based.
so
congress
has,
in
the
interstate
land
sales
act,
which,
we
would
submit
to
you,
is
recent.
it's
1979.
it
sits
right
in
the
middle
of
this
court's
most
important
holdings
in
the
securities
area,
it
represents
congress'
intent
on
what
it
should
do
in
a
fraud
case.
and
in
the
residual
judicial
reform
act,
enacted
last
year,
this
court
has...
the
congress
enacted
a
statute
of
limitations
which
is
discovery
based.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
i
think
you...
that
that
is
the
position
that
this
court
better
figure
on,
because
that
statute
has
been
interpreted
numerous
times...
not
numerous
times,
but
a
number
of
times,
as
it
applies
to
the
express
remedies,
and
the
courts
always
hold
that
it
is
a
statute
of
repose.
and
petitioner--
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
--no,
you
haven't.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
very
close.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
i
read
your
dissent
in
malley-duff.
i
agree
with
you.
i
don't
know
how
you
would
get
to
borrowing
state
statutes
of
limitations
in
this
case
in
the
first
place,
for
the
reasons
that
you
stated,
and
also
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
test.
there's...
this
borrowing
of
state
statutes
has
worked
for
40
years.
it
doesn't
interfere
with
state
policies.
it
appeals
to
certain
people
who
think
uniformity
is
very
important,
but
uniformity
at
what
price?
and
the
price
of
this
uniformity
is
going
to
be
this
3-year
statute
of
repose,
which
is
going
to
oust
the
federal
courts
of...
jurisdiction
over
interstate
securities
fraud
when
claims
are
brought
by
the
most
innocent
and
the
most
deserving
of
this
federal...
of
the
federal
courts'
attention.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
i
agree
with
that.
but
i
don't--
[laughter]
i
don't
agree
with
mr.
olson's
position.
it
would
be
a
reversal
of
this
court's...
this
court
has
always
said
that
the
legitimacy
of
section
10(b)
and
rule
10b-5
rests
more
on
congressional
ratification
than
original
congressional
intent.
that
has
been
the
position
of
this
court,
the
best
statement
of
which
is
found
in
the
blue
chip
stamp
case.
mr.
f.
gordon
allen,
iii
exactly.
and
you
would
be
sawing
it
down.
to
put
a
3-year
statute
of
repose
on
this
action
is
to
saw
it
down.
tolling
in
a...
tolling
in
a
fraud
case
is
not
only
the
policy
of
this
court
which
you
have
held
on
a
number
of
occasions,
it
is
also
the
policy
of
congress.
in
1934
congress
was
not
dealing
with
fraud
statutes
of
limitations.
congress,
when
dealing
with
fraud
statutes
of
limitations,
has
imposed
tolling.
you...
i
think
i
have
nothing
else
to
say.
i'm
going
to
yield
back
my
time.
thank
you
very
much.
