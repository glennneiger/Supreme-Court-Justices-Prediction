chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-333,
lampf
pleva,
et
al.
v.
gilbertson.
spectators
are
reminded
the
court
remains
in
session.
there's
to
be
no
talking.
mr.
olson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
olson.
mr.
allen,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
should
have
discovered
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
then
one...
another
result
is
that
the
statute
of
limitations
which
you
say
is
actually
applied
has
really
no
connection
with
any
other
statute
of
limitations
at
all,
if
it
doesn't
even
represent
the
state
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's...
well,
from
what
you
say,
the
duration
is
taken
from
the
state,
but
the
federal
courts
are
insisting
that
it
be
discovery
based.
then
that
really
severs
the
connection
with
state
statute,
so
that
the
federal
courts
are
really
just
making
it
up.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
only
part
of
it,
you
say.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
holmbrecht
against
arm...
what's
the
name
of
the
respondent?
holm--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--holmberg
against
armbrecht
was
never
laid
down
as
a
formula
to
apply
to
all
statutes
of
limitations,
was
it,
by
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
allen.
mr.
olson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you'll
have
to
be.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

you,
mr.
olson.

case
is
