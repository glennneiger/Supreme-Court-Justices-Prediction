mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
closely
related
questions.
first,
should
federal
securities
fraud
claims
under
section
10(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
be
governed
by
a
single
federal
statute
of
limitations
or
by
the
law
of
the
forum
state
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
second,
should
the
federal
rule
be
the
1-year/3-year
standard
established
by
congress
for
the
comparable
federal
securities
fraud
remedies
at
the
same
time
that
it
created
section
10(b),
or
by
a
limitations
period
enacted...
extracted
from
some
other
federal
law
passed
decades
later.
the
respondents
are
oregon
residents
who
brought
actions
under
section
10(b)
and
rule
10b-5
to
recover
the
losses
they
had
sustained
on
limited
partnership
tax
shelter
investments.
petitioner
is
a
new
jersey
law
firm
that
was
involved
in
preparing
some
of
the
offering
materials.
oregon's
2-year
fraud
statute
of
limitations
was
applied
by
both
courts
below
in
adjudicating
petitioner's
summary
judgment
motion.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
issues
of
fact
remained
as
to
when
the
alleged
fraud
was
discovered.
there
is
no
dispute,
however,
that
if
the
section
10(b)
claims
against
petitioner...
that
the
10(b)
claims
against
petitioner
would
have
to
be
dismissed
if
the
1-year/3-year
limitations
period
were
to
be
applied.
i
will
focus
today
on
three
principal
contentions.
first,
the
wasteful
and
debilitating
consequences
of
borrowing
state
limitations
periods
on
federal
policies,
the
federal
civil
justice
system,
and
federal
litigants
make
it
essential
that
a
uniform
federal
standard
be
adopted.
second,
the
1-year/3-year
limitation
period,
repeatedly
adopted
by
congress
when
it
enacted
the
1933
and
the
1934
securities
acts,
including
section
10(b),
is
the
only
choice
for
section
10(b)
that
is
compelled
both
as
a
matter
of
legislative
intent
and
as
the
standard
most
compatible
with
the
federal
remedy
and
the
federal
policies
underlying
that
remedy.
this
solution
has
been
endorsed
with
near
unanimity
by
the
courts,
commentators,
and
the
bar.
third,
neither
the
5-year
limitations
period
adopted
by
congress
in
1988
for
insider
trading,
nor
the
4-year
limitations
period
adopted
in
1979
for
land
sales
are
rational,
workable,
or
jurisprudentially
acceptable
alternatives.
turning
first
to
the
operation
and
effect
of
the
system
that
prevails
in
many
of
the
circuits
today,
that
system,
with
the
exception
of
the
three
circuits,
the
second,
seventh,
and
third
circuit,
is
to
apply
the
law
of
the
forum
state.
the
district
court
applies
the
fraud
statute
of
limitations,
the
blue
sky
statute
of
limitations,
the
contract
statute
of
limitations,
the
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations,
or
some
catch-all
statute
of
limitations,
depending
upon
the
particular
facts
of
the
particular
case
and
the
particular
forum
in
which
the
case
is
brought.
thus
there
are
50,
100,
150,
and
more
potential
statutes
of
limitations
to
apply
at
the
outset
in
a
10b-5
case.
state
statutes
of
limitations
for
fraud
or
blue
sky
may
vary
from
as
short
as
1
to
as
many
as
10
years,
and
these
complications
are
exacerbated
because
then
the
district
courts
apply
different
and
numerous
rules
of
tolling
with
respect
to
when
the
statute
of
limitations
has
begun
to
run.
furthermore,
as
respondents
point
out
and
concede
in
their
brief,
state
statutes
of
limitations
with
respect
to
fraud
or
blue
sky
are
constantly
changing.
this
complicates
the
district
court
jobs
further.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
may...
it
may
be
from
that
standpoint
generally
preferable
to
pick
a
federal
uniform
statute
of
limitations
for
a
federally
created
right.
but
this,
the
securities
laws
under
section
10(b),
are
at
the
far
end
of
the
spectrum,
because
there
must
be
an
interstate
nexus
to
begin
with.
that
was
not
the,
that's
not
the
case
in
many
of
the
statute
of
limitations
this
court
has
adjudicated
in
the
last
few
years.
there
must
be
an
interstate
nexus.
there
are
frequently
many
plaintiffs
and
many
defendants
from
many
different
states.
there
is
a
federal
source
to
turn
to
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
commentators
in
the
courts
that
have
struggled
with
this,
one
judge
from
the
seventh
circuit
said
this
is
as
enervating
as
it
can
possibly
be
in
the
federal
securities
field.
the
aba
special
committee
on
federal
securities
law
studied
this
and
said
that
this
is
a
disaster,
there
is
chaos,
there
is
forum
shopping,
there
is
litigation,
year
after
year
of
litigation
after
litigation.
those
same
choice
of
law
rules
that
the
court
just...
that
you
just
referred
to,
justice
scalia,
exacerbated
even
further--
in
new
york,
for
example,
the
district
court
in
new
york
will
either
apply
the
rule
of
new
york
if
it's
a
new
york
resident
bringing
the
action,
or
the
law
of
new
jersey
if
it's
a
new
jersey
resident
bringing
the
action.
the
second
circuit
in
the
ceres
partners
case
described
one
federal
securities
case
in
which
26
different
statute
of
limitations
were
applied,
and
another
case
in
which
34
different
statute
of
limitations
were
applied.
even
the
plaintiffs
concede
that
there
is
forum
shopping
in
this
area.
the
plaintiffs
indicated,
for
example,
there
undoubtedly
is
forum
shopping,
and
they
simply
said
that
there
is
no
imposition
on
the
federal
court
system.
well,
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
an
imposition
on
the
federal
court
system
to
be...
for
there
to
be
forum
shopping.
there
is
inconsistency,
injustice,
unfairness.
there
are
different
results
for
different
litigants
similarly
situated.
there
is
uncertainly
in
the
marketplace
for
the
marketing
of
federal
securities...
this
is
an
important
segment
of
our
national
and
international
economy...
and
it
undermines
federal
policies,
the
very
federal
policies
that
were
at
work
in
1933
and
1934
when
congress
enacted
the
'33
and
'34
act,
the
importance
of
establishing
uniform
enforcement
in
federal
securities
laws.
as
this
court
specifically
has
held
in
the
wilson
case,
few
areas
of
the
law
stand
in
greater
need
of
firmly
defined,
easily
applied
rules
than
does
the
subject
of
statutes
of
limitations.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
they
do
not
apply
the
doctrine
of
latches--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they
do
not...
the
doctrine
of
latches
generally
would
be
applied
in
cases
involving
equity
rather
than
cases
for
the
vindication
of
private
rights
of
action
for
damages
in
the
10(b)
context.
doctrines
sounding
like
latches
are
applied
in
that
the
district
courts
and
the
states
sometimes
apply
equitable
tolling
doctrines,
which
amount
to
the
same
things,
to
justify
whether
or
not
a
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
in
a
given
case
or
not.
in
fact,
it's
true
that
in
this
case
everyone,
everyone...
the
sec,
the
petitioner,
the
respondents...
agree
that
the
present
system
is
unacceptable
and
should
be
changed.
the
respondents
offer
a
modification
of
the
present
system,
but
even
they
agree
that
the
present
system
should
be...
changed.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's...
as
you
know,
justice
scalia,
it's
not
that
simple
necessarily
to
get
a
statute.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
many
of
the
commentators
have
agreed
that
congressional
legislation
in
this
area
would
be
beneficial.
the
aba
study,
a
special
study
that
i
referred
to,
specifically
suggested
congressional
legislation.
there
has
not
yet--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
the
congress
bit
off
in
the
judicial,
or
justice
improvement
act,
which
was
passed
in
1990,
about
as
much
as
it
felt
that
it
could
chew
at
that
particular
point.
it
decided
that
a
4-year
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
in
specific--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--for
all
private
remedies
created
by
future
acts
of
congress,
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
answer
to
that,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
is
found
in
this
court's
repeated
statement,
and
most
recently,
or
perhaps
not
most
recently,
but
recently
in
footnote
1
in
the
patterson
v.
mclean
case.
congress
makes
law
by
affirmative
actions
of
both
houses
of
congress,
signed
by
the
president,
not
by
inaction.
every
time,
every
time
the
congress...
let
me
resort,
return
to
the
1
and
3-year
statute
of
limitations,
because
congress
did
consider
the
subject
of
statutes
of
limitations
for
private
remedies
under
the
securities
acts
of
1933
and
1934.
the
73d
congress
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
considering,
as
this
court
has
indicated,
we
must
resort--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
court...
the
congress
at
that
time...
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
cause
of
private
right
of
action
under
section
10(b)
is
implied
from
section
10(b).
section
10(b)
did
not
explicitly
create
an
express
cause
of
action
or
a
statute
of
limitations.
therefore
congress
did
not
expressly
focus
it...
on
it
and
enact
a
statute
of
limitations.
but
i
submit
that
congress
focuses...
focused
on
the
subject
about
as
closely
and
as
carefully
as
congress
could
under
the
circumstances.
the
congress
in
1933
and
1934...
and
there
were
two
acts...
focused
expressly
on
a
uniform
national
legislation,
a
regimen,
regime
of
governing
securities
transactions
in
the
united
states.
ultimately,
this
court
has
said,
the
test
is
what
congress,
what
balance
would
congress
have
preferred.
that's
the
standard
articulated
in
the
wilson
case
and
repeated
in
the
delcostello
case
and
in
the
agency
holding
case.
what
standard
would
congress
have
preferred.
what
happened
in
1933
and
1934
when
the
1933
and
1934
securities
acts
were
created,
is
that
congress
expressly
created
five
or
six
separate,
specific
private
rights
of
action.
and
the
one
thing
that
congress
focused
on
in
conjunction
with
each
of
those
causes
of
action,
and
the
desire
by
congress
that
federal
securities
law
be
treated
uniformly
in
the
courts
of
the
nation,
is
that
every
express
cause
of
action
created
by
congress
in
1933
and
1934
was
given
an
express
statute
of
limitation.
secondly,
every
express
statute
of
limitations
created
by
congress
in
1933
and
1934
was
a
nontollable
outside
limit,
1-year/3-year
statute
of
limitations,
a
maximum
outside
limitation
of
3
years
for
the
vindication
of
the
right.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
they're
not,
justice
stevens.
each
of
the
statutes
created
in
section...
in
the
securities
act
of
'33
and
'34
is
somewhat
different.
one
of
them
deals
with
misrepresentations
in
registration
statements.
one
of
them
deals
with
misrepresentations
in
prospectuses.
one
of
them
deals
with
stock
listed
on
an
exchange.
but
the
panoply
of
those
statutes
taken
together,
some
of
which
have
slightly
different
standards,
they
are
all...
they
all
have
two
or
three
things
in
common.
they
are
all
federal
securities
regulations
that
create
private
rights
of
actions.
they
all
have
an
express
statute
of
limitations,
and
a
nontollable
3-year
maximum
statute
of
limitations.
and
generically,
congress
decided,
however
much
each
of
the
specific
limitations
period
would
be
different
from
one
another,
each
of
them
would
be
subject
to
the
same
1-year/3-year
statute
of
limitations
period.
so
although
there
are
differences
in
the
remedies,
there
is
no
difference
in
the
limitations
period
that
congress
intended
to
apply.
and
each
time
this
court
has
considered
what
should...
in
the
first
place
i
should
step
away
for
a
moment
and
say
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
whether
the
right...
whether
an
implied
right
of
action
should
exist
under
a
federal
statute
is
ultimately
a
matter
of
legislative
intent.
and
this
court
has
determined,
each
time
it
has
examined
the
contours
of
an
implied
right
of
action,
has
looked
to
the
congress
that
created
the
remedy
from
which
the
courts
discern
a
right
of
action.
and
each
time
this
court
has
considered
section
10(b),
section
17
of
the
'33
act,
section
14
of
the
'34
act,
or
other
aspects
of
federal
securities
regulations,
the
court
has
uniformly
turned
to
the
73d
congress
to
determine
not
only
whether
such
a
right
exists,
but
whether...
what
the
scope
and
limitations
and
contours
of
that
right
would
be.
the
court
did
it
in
the
blue
chip
case,
the
court
did
it
in
ernst
&
ernst...
in
the
ernst
&
ernst
case,
piper
v.
chris-craft,
and
on
and
on.
the
court
has
repeatedly
looked
to
that
one
source
of
information
as
to
what
congress
might
have
preferred.
and
in
this
case
what
congress--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it...
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
you...
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this...
invariably
when
the
court
has
construed
the
scope
and
contours,
whether
sienter
is
required
under
section
10(b),
whether
preponderance
of
the
evidence
or
a
clear
and
convincing
standard,
whether
section
10(b)
is
limited
to
purchasers
and
sellers,
the
court
has
invariably
turned
to
what
congress
did
in
1933
and
1934,
the
73d
congress.
and
this
court
has
not
considered
the
statute
of
limitations
before.
this
is
the
first
time
that
that
has
directly
come
before
this
court
and
has
been
directly
presented.
but
we
submit
that
the
only
source
to
discern,
the
only
reliable
source
to
discern
what
would
congress
has
intended,
is
that
very
same
source.
it
is
also
true
that
if
the
court
adopts
a
separate
or
a
distinct
methodology,
which
i
think,
and
i
respectfully
submit,
is
really
the
same
as
looking
at
legislative
intent
anyway,
but
if
the
court
looks
at
it
differently
and
applies
the
analogy
standard
that
is
articulated
in
the
agency
holding
v.
malley-duff
case,
one
draws...
comes
to
the
same
conclusion.
in
blue
chip
this
court
examined,
in
order
to
determine
the
scope
and
contours
of
section
10(b)
with
respect
to
the
purchaser
and
seller
requirement,
it...
this
court
looked
to
the
express
causes
of
action
in
the
'33
and
'34
act,
called
them
comparable
causes
of
action,
said
that
they
were
the
appropriate
vehicle
and
analogy
to
compare
them
with.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
standards
of
fraud
under
the
common
law
are
light
years
away
from
the
right
created
under
section
10(b),
and
that
those
comparable
causes
of
action
do
provide
an
appropriate
analogy
because
they
are
federal,
they
are
intended
to
be
uniform,
they
are
intended
to
provide
private
redress
for
securities
fraud,
they
all
arise
at
the
same
time.
and
the
other
aspect
of
this
from
the
standpoint
of
the
analogy
standard
is
that
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
a
longer
period
of
limitations
for
section
10(b),
5
years,
for
example,
as
the
commission
suggests,
that
would
tend
to
write
out,
nullify,
or
repeal
the
legislation
that
the
30...
the
73d
congress
specifically
focussed
on
and
enacted
with
respect
to
these
other
statutes,
because,
as
this
court
has
noted,
the
actions
under
section
9
of
'34
act,
sections
11
and
12
of
the
'33
act,
and
so
forth,
can
be
brought
under
section
10(b).
so
an
artful
pleader,
if
given
a
choice
between
a
5-year
statute
of
limitations
as
the
commission
urges,
and
the
1
and
3-year
statute
of
limitations
that
congress
expressly
adopted,
would
naturally
plead
it
under
section
10(b)
to
take
advantage
of
the
5-year
statute
of
limitations,
thus
resulting
in
a
judicial
nullification
of
the
express
intent
of
congress.

can't

mr.

it's
right
only
in
a
very
limited
sense,
in
the
sense
that
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
will.
most
of
the
causes
of
action
that
might
be
brought
under
10(b)
cannot
be
pleaded
under
the...
we'll
call
it
the
insider--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
congress
expressly
decided...
you're
correct
in
stating
that
congress
expressly
decided
for
a
narrow
band,
a
very
peculiar
type
of
section
10(b)
violations.
and
it's
not
just
10(b).
that
1988
statute--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
does
involve
10(b).
it
involves--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
is
not
the
closest.
in
the
first
place,
if
the
ultimate
test
is
legislative
intent,
the
appropriate
place
to
look
first
of
all
is
to
the
language
of
that
specific
1988
statute.
what
congress
said
in
that
1988
statute,
and
respondents
concede
on
page
42
of
their
brief
that
congress
could
not
have
been
clearer
with
respect
to
this,
it
did
not
intend
that
1988
statute
to
apply
otherwise
to
section
10(b)
or
any
other
of
the
securities--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
is
already
the
one--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--not...
no,
justice
white,
because
there
are
already
the
1
and
3-year
statute
of
limitations
that
apply
to
many
of
the
facts
that
might
be
pleaded
under
section
10(b).
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
1988
statute
carved
out
a
very
narrow
niche
of
people
trading
on
inside
information
who
may
sue
contemporaneous
traders
for
a
very
limited
remedy,
that
is,
they
may
only
recover
the
profit
of
the
contemporaneous
trader
in
the
same
type
of
securities.
but
congress
specifically
said
nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
limit
or
condition
a
right
of
any
person
to
enforce
a
requirement
of
this
title
or
the
availability
of
any
cause
of
action
implied
from
a
provision
of
this
title.
thus
congress
could
not
have
been
clearer
that
it
did
not
intend
the
1988
legislation
to
apply
to
section
10(b)
actions
beyond
this...
the
narrow
hybrid
remedy
that
was
created
to
solve
a
specific
problem
created
by...
what
the
congress
perceived
was
created
was
a
judicial
decision.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
limitations
period
covers
any...
let
me
put
it
this
way,
justice
scalia,
that
that
statute
creates
a
right,
a
remedy
for
a
violation
of
either
section
10(b)
or
other...
violation
of
other
provisions
of
the
'34
act.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
which
already
have
their
own
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
exact...
that's
precisely
correct.
and
what
congress
was
saying...
the
history
of
the
1988
statute
is
that
congress
did
not
really
focus
on
the
statute
of
limitations
at
all.
there
is
very
little
legislative
history.
the
statute
was
originally,
in
the
1988
legislation,
was
taken
from
the
insider
trader
sanctions
act
of
1984,
which
had
a
5-year
limitation
period
which
restricted
the
right
of
the
sec
to
seek
certain
civil
penalties.
that
in
turn
was
taken
from
the
5-year
federal
criminal
statute
of
limitations.
what
congress
did
in
each
of
these
events
was
repeat
that
5-year
statute
of
limitation.
it
didn't
focus
on
the
balancing
process,
which
is
what
congress
clearly
did,
and
i
probably
should
return
to
this
point.
the
one
thing
that
congress
did
in
1933
and
1934
is
to
conduct
the
kind
of
balancing
that
this
court
says
is
necessary
to
evaluate
when
and
what
are
the
limitations
of
an
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
period.
several
members
of
the
congress
indicated
that
they
had
not
in
their
lifetime
been
exposed
to
more
debate,
public
commentary,
public
controversy,
with
respect
to
what
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be.
when
the
1933
act
was
passed
and
express
remedies
were
created,
the
congress
enacted
a
2-year/10-year
statute
of
limitations.
there
was,
there
was
a
great
amount
of
public
outcry
and
lobbying,
both
from
the
business
community
and
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
issue.
congress
then
had
considerable
hearings
and
debates,
and
specifically
conducted
that
balancing.
they
understood
that
they
might
be
cutting
off
the
rights
of
some
plaintiffs
when
they
enacted
a
statute
of
limitations
that
was
the
length
that
they
enacted
in
1934.
but
they
did
so
quite
intentionally
and
they
considered
the
impact
of
the
potential,
which
is
described
well
by
this
court
in
chief
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
blue
chip
case,
the
effect
of
section
10b-5
actions
might
have
on
officers,
directors,
accountants,
underwriters,
issuers,
and
so
forth,
and
the
international
marketplace.
the
court
conducted
that
balancing
process
and
decided
that
that
3-year
statute
of
limitations
was
the
right
solution
for
securities
act
limitations.
the
one
thing
that
i
would
like
to
mention
before
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
is
that
the
respondents
have
urged
that
the
international...
the
interstate
land
sales
act,
which
was
amended
in
1979
to
have
a
4-year
statute
of
limitations,
ought
to
be
the
guide.
i
would
simply
like
to
reiterate
what
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
that
the
interstate
land
transactions
act,
congress
was
not
balancing
the
importance
of
secondary
markets
and
the
effect
upon
the
economy
of
litigation
with
respect
to
securities.
this
is
a
statute
which
congress
enacted
without
consideration
of
what
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
ought
to
be
in
securities
cases,
and
it
is
a
nontollable...
it
is
a
tollable,
arguably,
statute
of
limitations.
the
respondents
favor
that
statute
of
limitations
because
they
contend
that
there
should
be
a
tollable
statute
of
limitations.
i
say
that
that
is
the
strongest
evidence
that
it's
not
the
right
statute
of
limitations,
because
the
one
thing
about
which
there
was
virtually,
if
any...
there
was
no
dissent
in
1934,
none
in
the
senate
anyway,
that
the
absolute
3-year
statute
should
be
a
bar
and
that
there
should
not
be
in
this
field
a
tollable
statute
of
limitations.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i'll
be
very
brief.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
one
of
the
points
that
respondents
make
is
that
there
must
be
a
discovery-based
statute
of
limitations
in
the
securities
fraud
area.
that
is
a
concept
which
congress
debated
and
rejected.
the
debate
was
extensive
and
congress
rejected
it.
congress
knew
that
it
was
cutting
off
rights,
and
it
intended
to
cut
off
rights,
because
it
balanced
the
enforcement
objectives
and
the
remedial
objectives
of
the
'33
and
'34
act
with
the
effect
of
those
remedies
on
the
marketplace,
and
it
cut
off
those
rights
and
it
intended
it
not
to
be
a
discovery
based
limitation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
problem
with
what
my
opponent
says
with
respect
to
those
are
not
being
fraud
actions,
is
that
congress
repeatedly
characterized
those
actions
as
fraud
actions.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1933
and
'34
act
contain
the
word
"fraud"
literally
thousands
of
times
in
reference
to
the
express
remedies
created
by
those
statutes.
they
are...
some
of
them
have
less
of
a
standard
of
proof
for
the
plaintiff,
some
of
them
have
a
greater
standard
of
proof.
section
9
of
the
'34
act
does
require
sienter.
the
one
thing
in
common
with
respect
to
the
statutes
that
congress
created,
the
remedies
that
congress
created
that
the
congress
called
fraud
statutes...
some
of
which
had
sienter,
some
of
which
did
not...
is
that
they
all
had
an
express
statute
of
limitations,
they
all
had
the
same
statute
of
limitations,
and
it
cut
off
the
rights
at
3
years.
the
holmberg
case
v.
armbrecht
dicta
is
just
that.
it's
dicta
by
justice
frankfurter
in
an
equity
case.
as
this
court
said
in
american
pipe
and
construction
v.
utah
in
1974,
the
concept
of
federal
tolling
must
be
construed
to
be
consistent
and
consonant
with
the
legislative
scheme
and
the
legislative
purpose.
in
this
case
the
legislative
scheme
and
the
legislative
purpose
are
clear.
if
there
is,
as
this
court
said
in
touche
ross
v.
redington,
if
there
is
any
injustice
as
a
result
of
someone's
right
being
cut
off,
that...
if
this
result,
as
the
court
said,
then
sanctions
injustice,
that
argument,
when
made
here,
is
made
in
the
wrong
forum.
this
court
is
not
at
liberty
to
legislate.
the
73d
congress
conducted
the
legislative
activities
necessary
to
apply
a
statute
of
limitations
to
the
'33
and
'34
acts
and
the
section
10(b)
remedy.
as
this
court
said
in
delcostello,
the
family
resemblance
between
section
10(b)
and
the
other
'33
and
'34
act
express
remedies
is
undeniable.
there's
an,
a
substantial
overlap
of
remedies
and
the
balancing
of
interests
is
the
same.
congress
has
conducted
that
balance
of
interest,
of
remedies,
and
selected
a
3-year
statute
of
limitations.
