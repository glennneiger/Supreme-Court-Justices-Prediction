--well,
what
if...
so
what.
these
may
be
that
kind
of
an
answer,
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that...
that
it
amounts
to
intentional
discrimination
based
on
race
or
ethnic
origin
to
say
that
because
you're
bilingual,
you
can't
sit
on
this
jury.
justice
white
to
say
that
intentionally
excluding
a
juror
by
peremptory
challenge
because
the
juror
is
bilingual--
justice
white
--is
a
discrimination
based
on
race
or
ethnic
origin.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that...
let's
assume
that
the
witness
or
that
a
juror
is
from
a
certain...
from
a
certain
section
of
a
foreign
country,
now
a
nationalized
citizen,
but
that
foreign
country
has
all
sorts
of
areas
in
it
and
people
speak
a
different
kind
of
language
in
each
area.
i
mean,
they
have
a
little
nuances...
different
nuances...
dialects.
don't
you
think
the...
do
you
think
that
a
juror
then
should
be
required
to
follow
the
official
translations?
justice
white
well,
you
would
have
a
better
case
i
suppose
if...
if
one
of
these...
if
the
prosecutor
asks,
can
you
follow
the
interpreter,
and
he
says,
of
course,
i
can
and
i
will.
nevertheless,
he's
got...
the
prosecutor
struck
him.
justice
white
so,
if
there...
if
there
were
six
jurors,
latino
jurors,
that
he
was
examining
and
three
of
them
said,
of
course,
i
can.
and
he
seated
them
and
he
didn't
strike
them.
and
three
others
said,
i
will
try,
but
i'm
going
to
have
some
difficulty.
and
he
struck
them,
you
would
still
be
here
i
guess?
justice
white
you
would
still
be
here.
justice
white
so
it's
hard
to
say...
it's
hard
to
say
on
those
facts
that
he
has
an
intentional
discrimination
against
all
latinos.
justice
white
apparently,
it
would
have
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
