justice
o'connor
well,
now,
if
that
reason
is
true
that
that
was
the
basis
for
the
prosecutor's
strike,
are
you
arguing
that
there
can
be
no
peremptory
strike
on
that
basis?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
rather
a
remarkable
position
to
take,
isn't
it?
i
mean
ordinarily
if,
if
a
prosecutor
is
aware
that
there's
going
to
some
foreign
language
translation
required,
and
if
the
prosecutor
thinks
that
some
particular
perspective
juror
will
not
abide
by
the
translation
of
the
language
and
yet
speaks
the
language,
i
think
it's
quite
remarkable
to
say
that
there
cannot
be
a
peremptory
challenge,
may
be
even
a
challenge
for
cause--
justice
o'connor
--on
that
basis.
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't--
--there
was
some
evidence
here
i
thought
that
the
prosecutor
challenge
was
based
some
of
the
reaction
of
the
particular
jurors
to
the
questions.
justice
o'connor
well--
justice
o'connor
--but
didn't
the
trial
judge
find
that
the
prosecutor
stated
reason
was
his
real
reason?
isn't
that
a
finding
of
the
trial
court
judge?
justice
o'connor
we
assume
in
deciding
this
cased
that
the
stated
reason
was
his
real
reason.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you--
--but
then
you're
not
accepting
it.
go
ahead,
justice.
do
you
understand
batson
to
require
some
kind
of
disparate
impact
analysis
as
opposed
to
a
finding
of
intention
discrimination?
justice
o'connor
--well,
that
just
sounds
to
me
like
a
rule
applying
a
disparate
impact
analysis
as
opposed
to
a
finding
of
intentional
discrimination.
i
think
you're
asking
us
for
a...
some
kind
of
a
blanket
rule,
based
on
disparate
impact
on
latinos.
justice
o'connor
it
sounds
like
it.
justice
o'connor
mr.
cohen,
would
it
offend
a
raceneutral
reason
for
the
prosecutor
to
strike
every
bilingual
juror
without
regard
to
any
questions
and
responses?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
reason
the
prosecutor
gives
when
called
under
batson
is
they're
bilingual.
justice
o'connor
how
about
if
he
says
the
reason
is
because
they
had
an
hispanic
surname?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
it
was
racial
discrimination,
not
just
discrimination.
it's...
justice
stevens
is
posing
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
the
tie
that
one
wears.
that's
discrimination.
justice
o'connor
mr.
cohen,
what...
what
is
the
standard
of
review
that
this
court
should
apply
to
the
determinations
made
in
state
court
in
this
case
concerning
the
prosecutors'
motives?
justice
o'connor
is
that
consistent,
do
you
think,
with
norris
against
alabama
and
some
other
cases
from
this
court
saying
at
least
that
we
will
conduct
an
independent
review
of
state
court
fact
finding
in
jury
discrimination
cases?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
a...
application
of
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
is
consistently
with
norris
against
alabama?
justice
o'connor
well,
we're
not
concerned
with
the
standard
of
review
applied
by
the
state
appellate
court.
it's
what
standard
does
this
court
apply.
