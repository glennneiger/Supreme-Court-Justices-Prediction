justice
scalia
mr.
kimerling,
you're
coming
up
to
your
time
limit,
and
i--
justice
scalia
--yeah,
i'm
worried
that
you
haven't
said
anything
about
the
second
question--
justice
scalia
--that
you've
taken
this
case
for
and
which
to
my
mind
is
a...
is
a
more
significant
one
as
far
as
its
impact
on
other
cases.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
your
time.
justice
scalia
mr.
kimerling,
i
think
that
hypothetical
would
come
out
the
way
you
do...
the
way
you
suggest,
that
is,
that
it
would
be
in
violation
of
batson.
but
it...
to
my
mind,
it...
that
would
be
the
result
only
because
no,
no
trial
judge
in
his
right
mind
would
believe
that
argument.
justice
scalia
that's
why
that
comes
out.
justice
scalia
mr.
cohen,
any
reason
can
serve
as
a
pretext.
justice
scalia
i
mean
any
reason.
justice
scalia
you
can
give
me
the
best
reason
in
the
world
and
if
i
don't
believe
it,
it's
a
pretext.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
what--
justice
scalia
--it
proves
to
say
it
could
serve
as
a
pretext.
why
isn't
it
reasonable
for
a
prosecutor
to
say
look
at...
i
don't
care
whether
he
says
confidently,
i
can
do
it
or
not.
the
fact
is
it's
very
hard
if
you
know
the
language
the
fellow
is
speaking
to
believe
the
translator
who
mistranslates
it.
it's
very
hard
to
do.
so
i
don't
care
whether
this
person
says
he
can
do
it
or
not.
i
would
rather
have
people
on
the
jury
who
don't
understand
the
language
that's
being
translated.
justice
scalia
can
the
prosecutor
do
that?
justice
scalia
let
me
interpret
if
i
may,
mr.
cohen.
supposing
there
isn't
any
question
about
the
bona
fides
of
the
prosecutor's
belief
that
bilingual
jurors
may
have
an
undue
influence
when
they
get
in
the
jury
room
and
they
may
not
believe
the
judge's
instruction
that
they
should
follow
the
translator's
version
rather
than
their
own
view.
justice
scalia
and
therefore,
the
prosecutor's
office
adopts
as
a
matter
of
office
policy
in
writing,
always
challenge
bilingual
jurors
for
that
reason,
would
we
say
that
was
a
sufficient
reason
under...
no
question
of
pretext...
should
we
accept
that
as
a
sufficient
reason?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
is
that
all
right?
justice
scalia
but
if
it
wasn't
a
pretext,
it
would
be
all
right?
justice
scalia
no,
you
said...
you
said
the
prosecutor
could
adopt
general
rules
before
i
think
in
response
to
justice
stevens.
you
said
he
could
adopt
a
general
rule,
that
we
are
not
going
to
ever
allow
to
sit
on
the
jury
somebody
that...
in
the
case
where
there's
a
translation
necessary...
somebody
who
speaks
that
language.
and
you
said
that
was
okay.
justice
scalia
which
rule
are
you
talking
about?
now,
mine
or
the
language
one?
justice
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
scalia
was
pretext.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
related
to
the
case
on
trial.
what
good
is
a
peremptory
unless
you
can
use
it
if
you
think
it's
related?
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
agree
that
it's
related.
he
can
strike
people
because
he
doesn't
like
the
way
they
comb
their
hair,
can't
he?
justice
scalia
like
speaking
a
language.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
ought
to
be
careful
where
you're
going.
