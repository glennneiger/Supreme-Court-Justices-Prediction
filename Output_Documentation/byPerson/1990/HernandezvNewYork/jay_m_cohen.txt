mr.
jay
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
premise
of
petitioner's
case
that
the
peremptory
challenges
here
must
be
rejected
because
all
bilingual
latinos
will
answer
these
questions
in
the
same
way
is
fundamentally
at
odds
with
this
court's
equal
protection
analysis
in
three
ways.
first,
he
substitutes
a
prediction
of
what
caused
the
jurors
to
give
the
case-related
answers
that
they
gave
for
proof
of
an
intent
to
discriminate
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor.
second,
he
rejects
the
individualized
assessment
of
each
juror's
ability
to
serve
in
this
case
that
actually
occurred
here
in
favor
of
an
assumption,
a
group-based
assumption
or
stereotype,
about
the
behavior
of
bilingual
latinos
in
general...
the
kind
of
stereotype
that
this
court
has
condemned.
and
third,
acceptance
of
his
argument
would
require
the
acceptance
of
jurors
even
when
they
often
case-related...
a
nondiscriminatory
basis
for
their
challenge
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
not
necessarily.
however,
if
the
prosecutors...
it
could
be
a
race-neutral
reason,
but
there
are
a
couple
of
circumstances
under
which
it
would
not
be.
if
the
basis
for
the
prosecutor's
challenge--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--that
reason
could
serve,
depending
on
how
it's
applied
to
the
case,
as
a
pretext
for
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
their
national
origin.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
well,
by
the
same
token,
that
reason
could
serve
as
a
pretext,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
second
one.
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
prosecutor
to
show
that
their
surname
had
any
relevance
whatsoever
to
the
case
and--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--right.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
well,
but
what
i
mean
though
is
that--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--that--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--that...
challenging
bilingual
jurors
is
on
its
face,
race-neutral.
however,
if
the
prosecutor
uses
that
reason
in
a
disparate
way...
he
uses
it
for
example
to
challenge
only
latino
bilinguals
or
if
the
particular
issue
in
the
case
doesn't
really
indicate
that
their
ability
to
speak
another
language
will
affect
their
ability
to
serve
as
jurors--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--correct.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
this
court
in
batson
said
that
challenges
to
cognizable
groups
would
raise
an
inference,
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
and
challenges
on
that
basis
alone
would
reflect
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor.
now,
this
court
has
held
and
in
fact--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--the
answer
is
challenging
someone
simply
on
the
basis
of
their
language
ability
would
not
be
a
discriminatory
reason
under
batson.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
if...
yes.
if,
however...
if,
however,
that
reason
was
used
to
challenge
in
either
one
particular
case
or
in
a
series
of
cases
latinos,
the
court
could
still
determine
that
the
real
reason
for
the
prosecutor's
use
of
that...
of
language
ability
was
an
intent
to
discriminate
in
violation
of
batson.
for
example,
if
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
had
not
asked
the
jury--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
batson--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--yes.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
but
in
that
situation
if
the
court
could
not
determine
why
the
fact
that
a
juror
wore
a
bow
tie
was
at
all
relevant
to
the
case,
and
if
it
actual
happened
in
that
particular
case
that
the
only
jurors
who
wore
bow
ties
were
black
jurors,
he
could--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--this
court
in
its
sixth
amendment
cases
and
in
its
fourteenth
amendment
cases
has
indicated
that
batson
prohibits
challenges
exercised
on
the
basis
of
some
discrimination
and
does
not
challenge...
prohibit
challenges
exercised
on
the
basis
of
other
kinds
of
assumptions
based
on
other
criteria.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
but
there's
nothing
in
batson
that
prohibits
a
prosecutor's
reliance
on
that
criteria
so
long
as
his
reliance
on
that
criteria
is
not
a
pretext
for
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
some
prohibited
characteristic.
now,
it's
important
to
realize
that
in
this
case
the
prosecutor
did
not
rely
on
any
of
those
kinds
of
criteria.
the
prosecutor
relied
instead
on
the
answers
that
the
jurors
gave
in
response
to
questions
about
a
case-related
concern.
petitioner
concedes
that
they
in
fact
gave
those
answers,
that
they
did
express
that
hesitation
or
equivocation,
and
he
also
concedes
that
the
concern
that
the
prosecutor
asked
them
about
was
related
to
the
case
on
trial.
but
he
nonetheless
says
that
this
court
is
required
to
find
what
he
calls
a
per
se
violation
of
batson
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
in
the
record
that
the
prosecutor
used
that
case-related
concern
to
discriminate
against
latinos.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
this
court
should
apply
the
clear
error
standard.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
yes,
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
independent
review
of
the
record,
including
the
record
on
the
facts,
and
deference
to
the
trial
court's
fact
finding.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
yes,
in
norris
this
court
indicated
that
it
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
facts
compelled
a
result
from
the
result
that
the
state
court
had
found.
but
that...
and
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
clear
error
standard.
this
court
has
also
indicated
that
even
within
the
clear
error
standard,
if
this
court
or
another
appellate
court
is
left
with
the
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
the
result
is
incorrect
that
despite
the
fact
finding
below,
that
this
court
can
still
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
the
standard
of
review
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
applied
in
this
case
is
the
standard
of
review
that
this
court
cited
in
batson,
that
this
court
has
applied
consistently
in
its
discrimination
cases.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
but
the
standard
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
applied...
applied,
your
honor,
is
the
same
standard
that
this
court
has
itself
applied
to
state
court
determinations
of
discrimination.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
well,
in
this
case,
the
courts
found
that
a...
that
a
prima
facie
case
was
made
out.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
in
response
to
that
prima
facie
case,
this
court
in
batson
indicated
that
a
prosecutor
must
offer
a
race-neutral
reason.
and
one
of
the
ways
that
this
court
expressly
judged
whether
or
not
a
reason
is
race
neutral
is
whether
or
not
it's
related
to
the
case
on
trial.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
no.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
well,
yes,
your
honor.
and
once
again
in
this
court's
expression
in
holland
v.
illinois,
for
example,
of
its
concern
about
extending
the
sixth
amendment...
applying
a
batson
analysis
to
sixth
amendment
cases
and
its
reference
in
batson
to
cognizable
racial
groups
indicates
that
what
the
court
meant
in
batson
was
to
prohibit
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
i
would
believe
that
the
kinds
of
characteristics
that
this
court
would
prohibit
would
be
those
kinds
of
characteristics
that
this
court
has
said
reflect
an
intent
to
discriminate
under
equal
protection,
such
as
race
or
national
origin.
and
those
characteristics
can
operate
in
two
ways.
first,
the
prosecutor
can
offer
them
as
the
reason
and
this
court
has
clearly
said
that
that
reason
on
its
face
is
a
violation
of
batson.
but
second,
the
prosecutor
can
offer
another
reason
that
is
race
neutral
on
its
face,
but
nonetheless
in
the
facts
and
circumstance
of
the
particular
case
reflect
an
intent
to
discriminate.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
it
would
seem
to--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--i
believe
that--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--i
believe
that
any
judge
would
find
that
a
reliance
on
that
criterion
was
a
pretext
for
a
discrimination
against
blacks.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
well,
but
in
order
it
not
to
be
a
pretext,
the
prosecutor
would
have
to
demonstrate
in
some
way
that
skin
color
was
relevant
to
the
particular
case
on
trial,
and
i
don't
think
a
prosecutor
could
ever
establish
that
it
would
not--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--i
believe
that
that
general
rule
reflect
a
pretext
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
to
discriminate.
and
the
fact
that
that
rule
has
a
certain
impact
on
blacks
as
opposed
to
others
is
not
irrelevant
to
the
analysis.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
yours,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
but
even
if
the
prosecutor
adopts
a
general
rule,
if
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
is
made
out,
the
court
is
still
required
to
determine
that
the
application
of
the
general
rule
in
the
particular
case
on
trial
does
not
reflect
an
intent
to
discriminate.
and
one
of
the
ways
the
court
does
that
is
to
determine
if,
in
fact,
the
application
of
that
rule
is
at
all
related
to
the
case
in
question.
in
addition
to--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--i
believe
that
a
judge...
if
the
judge
could
not
find...
first
of
all,
that
that
in
fact
would
not
be
the
case.
but
second
of
all,
that
is
a
judge
could
not
find
that
that
criteria
was
at
all
related
to
the
case
on
trial,
that
not
only
the
trial
judge,
but
the
appellate
judge
would
be
compelled
to
find
that
what
the
prosecutor
was
in
fact
doing
was--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--but
that
kind
of
a
factor,
because
it
has
such
an
impact
and
because
it
is
in
general...
it
would
seem
to
me
it--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--well,
no,
your--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--no,
your...
it
would
seem
to
me
appropriate
in
that
particular
case
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
the
prosecutor
had
intended
to
discriminate.
but
if
there
is
evidence
before
the
court
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
in
fact
intend
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
a
prohibited
characteristic
like
race
or
national
origin,
then
the
use
of
that
criteria
would
not
be
prohibited
by
this
court's
decision
on
that.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
can
furnish
very
important
evidence
of
intent,
but
in
petitioner's
analysis
it
is
the
impact
alone
that
substitutes
for
proof
of
an
intent
to
discriminate,
because
he
calls
this...
this
a
per
se
violation
of
batson
that
doesn't
require
that
there
be
any
to...
intent
to
discriminate
found.
and
another
problem
that's
created
by
that
analysis
is
let's
suppose
that
two
bilingual
jurors
answer
the
questions
the
same
way
in
the
same
case.
one
of
those
jurors
is
latino
and
one
of
those
is
not
latino.
the
prosecutor's
reason...
the
record...
and
the
prosecutor's
intent
is
the
same.
under
petitioner's
analysis,
it
would
be
open
to
show
that
if
the
hesitation,
the
equivocation...
if
the
answers
that
they
gave
in
the
course
of
that
trial
were
somehow
caused
by
their
national
origin,
that
the
latino
jurors
would
have
to
be
seated,
whereas
the
non-latino
jurors
would
not
have
to
be
seated.
and
that
is
not,
i
submit,
what
this
court's
decision
in
batson
requires.
in
addition,
if
reliance
on
the
juror's
hesitation
and
equivocation
in
this
case
is,
as
petitioner
calls
it,
a
per
se
violation
of
batson,
there's
no
reason
to
stop
the
analysis
at
a
peremptory
challenge.
a
prosecutor
could
no
more
rely
on
race
alone
in
the
exercise
of
a
cause
challenge,
i
submit,
than
a
peremptory
challenge.
but
if
this
hesitation
and
equivocation
is
on
the
same
plane
as
race,
then
had
the
jurors
in
this
case
said,
no,
your
honor,
we
cannot
do
what
we
are
being
asked
to
do.
if
it's
a
per
se
violation
of
batson,
the
prosecutor
could
not
even
rely
on
it
for
the
exercise
of
a
cause
challenge.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
evidence
in
the
record
indicates
the
prosecutor
told
the
court
that
he
believed
that
at
least
one
of
the
jurors
in
this
case
might
not
have
been
latino.
and
while
that
was
not
central
to
the
decision,
because
in
new
york
even
challenging
one
latino
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other.
although
the
defendant,
during
the
course
of
the
colloquy
about
the
prosecutor's
exercise
of
challenges,
the
defense
attorney
raised
no
issue
as
to
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
might
have
treated
certain
kinds
of
jurors
different
than
other
kinds
of
jurors.
so
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
any
disparate
treatment
on
his
part.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
no.
an
extension
of
this
court's
equal
protection
analysis
beyond
just
national
origin
and
beyond
language
to
a
juror's
hesitation
or
equivocation
in
response
to
case...
questions
about
the
juror's
ability
to
do
the
job
in
a
particular
case...
i
don't
believe
there
is
anything
in
this
court's
equal
protection
analysis
that
would
extend
the
prohibited
classifications
for
equal
protection
purposes
to
that
degree.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
realize,
too,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
this
assumption
that
all
bilingual
latinos
will
answer
the
same
way,
will
in
fact
occur.
it's
already
been
indicated
here
that
some
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
not
all
latinos
are
bilingual
at
all.
other
evidence
in
the
record
offered
by
petitioner...
other
evidence
on
appeal
offered
by
petitioner
indicates
that
there's
a
wide
range
of
bilingualism
from
people
who
have
a
great
ability
to
speak
and
understand
spanish
to
people
to
have
very
little
ability
to
speak
and
understand
spanish.
and
there's
certainly
no
reason
for
this
court
to
assume
that
within
that
range
of
ability
to
understand
this
language,
that
every
single
one
of
the
jurors
who
are
called
for
jury
service
are
going
to
answer
the
questions
in
the
same
way.
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
leap
that
this
court
rejected
in
batson.
petitioner
has
also
not
shown
anything
about
the
relevant...
the
eligible
jury
pool
and
how
this
issue
of
bilingualism
fits
into
that.
this
case
was
not
argued
and
asserted
on
the
basis
of
this
per
se
batson
violation
that...
that
petitioner
offers.
there
was
not
even
any
evidence
entered
into
the
record
that
every
single
bilingual
juror
would
answer
the
questions
the
same
way
that
these
jurors
did.
so
that
that
assumption
is
not
only
contrary
to
the
court's
equal
protection
principles
but
is
by
no
means
shown
and
certainly
not...
not
proven.
in
contrast
to
this
new
way
that
petitioner
would
approach
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
record
in
this
case
is
entirely
consistent
with
batson.
there
was
lengthy
questioning
by
both
the
district
attorney
and
the
court
on
the
issue
of
the
juror's
ability
to
follow
the
interpreter.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
as
characterized
by
the
prosecutor
in
their
answers.
the
basis
for
the
challenge
was
not
just
their
demeanor
but
the
answers
that
they
gave
in
response
to
these
questions.
petitioner
concedes
that
the
questions...
the
attribute
that
the
prosecutor
was
seeking
to
question
about
was
related
to
the
case
on
trial.
and
the
reason
that
the
prosecutor
offered
was
clear
and
specific,
and
there's
no
evidence
that
it
was
pretext
for
discrimination.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
well,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
although
i
also
don't
know
that
this
is
a
problem
that...
how
often
the
problem
comes
up...
at
least
as
far
as
jury
challenge--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--well,
the
prosecutors
wouldn't
in
each
individual
case
necessarily
have
the
same
concern.
the
court
does
charge
the
jury
that
they
are
required
to
decide
the
case
based
on
the
evidence.
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
would
be
the
interpretation
of
the
forum--
mr.
jay
m.
cohen
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
presume
that
if
the
issue
comes
up
in
a
particular
trial
the
court
may
very
well
explain
to
the
jurors
what
their
particular
responsibility...
responsibility
is
in
that
case.
if
i
may
conclude,
we
firmly
reject
the
view
that
this
case
represents
any
retreat
from
batson,
that
it
creates,
in
the
words
of
petitioner,
any
loophole
or
exception
to
batson
or
that
it
means
that
batson
does
not
apply
to
latinos?
the
reality
is
that
the
reason
in
this
case
cannot
be...
that
latinos
will
continue
to
be
judged
by
their
individual
ability
to
serve
in
a
particular
case.
all
this
case
stands
for
we
submit
is
the
proposition
that
latinos,
like
other
jurors,
who
actually
exhibit
during
the
course
of
a
voir
dire,
a
case-related,
record-supported
basis
to
question
their
ability
to
serve
as
jurors
in
a
particular
case,
that
they
can
be
subject
to
a
peremptory
challenge
in
the
absence
of
a
finding
that
the
district
attorney
intended
to
discriminate
in
any
way.
that's
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
found.
that's
what
this
court's
equal
protection
analysis
says,
identified
in
batson
holds,
and
therefore,
we
respectfully
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
holding
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
