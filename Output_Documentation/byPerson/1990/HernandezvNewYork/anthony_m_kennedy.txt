justice
kennedy
well,
the
prosecutor
here
said,
i
was
uncertain
as
to
whether
they
could
accept
the
interpreter
as
the
final
arbiter,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
different
than
saying
completely
disregard
what
you've
heard.
justice
kennedy
that's
what
i
have
some
difference
with
you,
because
that's
all
that
the
prosecutor
was
asking
that
you
would
accept
the
interpretation.
and
he
said,
i
had
great
uncertainty...
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
do
that.
justice
kennedy
well,
i...
suppose
he
says,
i
have...
i'm
just
not
sure
i
can
do
that.
i'll
have
great
difficulty
doing
that.
justice
kennedy
well,
it's
a
very
odd
proposition
that
you
concede
that
an
instruction
from
the
court,
a
direction
from
the
court,
is
correct,
that
it's
binding.
and
then
you
say
that
a
prosecutor
cannot
either
for
cause
or
peremptorily
excuse
a
juror
who
can't
comply
with
that.
i'm--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
comes
to
us
on
direct
review
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
two
counts
of
attempted
murder
and
two
counts
of
criminal
possession
of
a
weapon.
during
jury
selection,
the
prosecutor
used
four
preemptory
challenges
to
exclude
latinos
from
serving
on
the
jury.
petitioner
who
himself
is
latino
objected
that
the
prosecutor
was
exercising
preemptory
challenges
on
the
basis
of
race
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
as
it
interpreted
by
our
decision
in
batson
verus
kentucky.
the
petitioner
no
longer
presses
his
objection
with
respect
to
two
of
the
latino
jury
persons.
as
to
the
other
two
jurors
in
question,
the
prosecutor
explained
that
certain
testimony
in
the
case
would
be
given
in
spanish
and
translated
by
a
court
interpreter.
these
two
jurors
were
bilingual
and
the
prosecutor
and
judge
had
questioned
them
about
their
ability
to
accept
the
official
translation
of
the
spanish
language
testimony
rather
than
relying
on
their
own
understanding
of
it.
the
prosecutor
stated
that
he
challenged
these
jurors
because
their
demeanor
and
hesitation
in
answering
his
questions
caused
him
to
doubt
their
ability
to
defer
to
the
official
interpreter.
new
york
courts
found
no
violation
of
our
decision
in
batson.
today,
we
affirm
but
no
opinion
commands
the
majority
of
the
court.
in
an
opinion
for
plurality
of
the
court,
in
which
i
am
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
white,
and
justice
souter,
we
find
that
the
prosecutor
offered
a
race-neutral
explanation
for
the
preemptory
challenges.
in
this
portion
of
the
batson
analysis,
we
review
the
facial
validity
of
the
prosecutor's
given
reason
for
the
challenges.
here,
the
prosecutor
offered
a
reason
for
challenging
these
jurors
other
than
their
race,
specifically
his
perception
that
they
would
have
difficulty
deferring
to
the
translator.
we
explained
that
under
established
equal
protection
principles,
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor's
reasoning
might
result
in
the
disproportionate
exclusion
of
latinos
from
jury
service
does
not
mean
that
the
prosecutor's
basis
for
the
challenge
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
equal
protection
analysis
turns
on
the
intended
consequences
of
government
classifications.
unless
a
government
act
or
adapts
a
criterion
with
the
intent
of
causing
a
particular
impact,
that
impact
does
not
cause
the
criterion
to
violate
the
principle
of
race
neutrality.
nothing
in
this
prosecutor's
explanation
shows
that
he
chose
to
exclude
jurors
who
hesitated
in
answering
questions
about
following
the
interpreter
because
he
wanted
to
prevent
bilingual
latinos
from
serving
on
the
jury.
if
we
deemed
the
prosecutor's
reasons
for
striking
these
jurors
a
racial
classification
on
its
face,
it
would
follow
that
the
trial
judge
could
not
excuse
for
cause
a
juror
whose
hesitation
convinced
the
judge
of
the
juror's
inability
to
follow
the
official
translation
of
foreign
language
testimony.
if
the
explanation
is
not
race-neutral
for
the
prosecutor,
it
is
no
more
so
for
the
trial
judge.
while
the
reason
offered
by
the
prosecutor
for
a
preemptory
strike
need
not
rise
to
the
level
of
the
challenge
for
cause.
the
fact
that
it
corresponds
to
a
valid
for
cause
challenge
will
demonstrate
its
race-neutral
character.
since
the
reason
given
by
the
prosecutor
for
its
peremptory
challenge
was
race-neutral,
the
issue
then
becomes,
whether
the
state
courts
could
believe
the
prosecutor.
the
plurality
concludes
that
the
state
court's
decision
to
believe
the
prosecutor's
explanation
for
his
preemptory
challenges
should
be
reversed
only
if
clearly
erroneous.
this
conclusion
represents
a
finding
of
fact,
and
batson
explain
that
such
findings
should
be
accorded
great
deference.
applying
this
differential
standard
of
review,
the
plurality
finds
no
clear
error
in
the
state
court's
determination
that
the
prosecutor
had
given
the
true
reason
for
his
challenge
of
these
jurors.
the
plurality
opinion
emphasizes
that
our
decision
today
does
not
imply
that
exclusion
of
bilinguals
from
jury
service
is
wise
or
even
that
it
is
constitutional
in
all
cases.
we
would
face
a
quite
different
case
if
the
prosecutor
had
justified
his
peremptory
challenges
on
the
ground
that
he
simply
did
not
want
spanish-speaking
jurors.
it
may
be
for
certain
ethnic
groups
and
in
some
communities
that
proficiency
in
a
particular
language,
like
skin
color,
should
be
treated
as
a
surrogate
for
race
under
an
equal
protection
analysis.
further,
a
policy
striking
all
those
who
speak
a
given
language
without
regard
that
the
particular
circumstance
of
the
trial
where
the
responses
of
the
jurors
might
be
found
by
the
trial
judge
to
be
a
pretext
for
racial
discrimination.

o'connor

filed

concurring
opinion

which
justice
scalia

stevens
