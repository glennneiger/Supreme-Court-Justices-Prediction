justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
no.
89-7645,
dionisio
hernandez
v.
new
york.
mr.
kimerling?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
isn't
that...
isn't
your
statement
itself
a
form
of
stereotype
to
suggest
that
all
bilingual
jurors
react
exactly
the
same
way?
chief
justice
rehnquist
he's
entitled
to
interpret
their
demeanor
evidence
to
perhaps
cast
doubt
on
their
assurances.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kimerling,
there
you're...
you
have
to
rely
on
the
trial
judge.
i
mean,
you
really
have
two
questions
here,
but
you're
only
raising
the
second
one.
the
first
question
is
is
the
prosecutor's
reason
that
he
gives
really
the
true
reason
why
he
made
the
strike.
and
here
you
concede
that
that's
correct.
now,
the
trial
judge
can
say,
no,
i
don't
believe
the
prosecutor.
you
said
it
was
the
witnesses'
hesitancy,
but
i
think
you
really
wanted
just
to
get
rid
of
all
the
latinos.
but
here
the
finding
on
credibility
is
against
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
probably
should
address
the
second
question,
mr.
kimerling,
the
standard
of
review.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
think
any
deference
should
be
accorded
to
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
who
was
there
as
he
obviously
was
at
the
time
the
prosecutor
took
these
actions
as
to
the
truthfulness
of
the
prosecutor's
statement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it's
really...
we're
looking
for,
was
it
a
race-neutral
reason?
isn't
that
what
batson
said?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
presumably
is
i
suppose
a
question
of
law.
but
the
other
question
of
whether
the
reason
assigned
by
the
prosecutor
is
the
truthful
reason,
there
you
would
agree
deference
should
be
given
to
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--clearly
erroneous.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is...
does
that
mean
that
the
appellate
court
is
substituting
its
view,
as
it
may
on
some
cases...
for
the
trial
judges
as
to
the
truthfulness
of
the
prosecutor's
statement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
the
reason
i'm
doing
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
find
out
what
is
true,
isn't
it,
you
first
have
to
decide
whether
the
reason
he
gives
is
or
is
not
his
true
reason.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
kimerling.
and
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-7645,
hernandez
against
new
york
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
