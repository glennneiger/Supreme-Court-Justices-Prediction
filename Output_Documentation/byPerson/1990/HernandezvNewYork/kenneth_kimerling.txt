mr.
kenneth
kimerling
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
narrow
issue
under
the
court's
decision
in
batson
v.
kentucky,
an
issue
important
not
only
the
petitioner
here
but
to
every
other
puerto
rican
and
latino
in
this
country.
the
issue
in
this
case
boils
down
to
whether
or
not
after
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
jurors,
a
prosecutor
can
respond
by
simply
saying,
i
did
not
exclude
latino
jurors
because
they
were
latino.
i
excluded
these
jurors,
because
they
speak
and
understand
spanish.
the
way
that
this
issue
arises
in
this
case,
your
honors,
is
as
follows.
the
petitioner
was
on
trial.
the
prosecutor
excluded
every
latino
juror
that
came
before
him,
using
his
peremptory
challenges.
thus
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
was
established
under
batson.
the
prosecutor
was
called
on
to
give
his
reasons
for
excluding
latino
jurors.
at
that
point
the
prosecutor
said
that
he
and
the
court
had
questioned
the
jurors
about
an
instruction
to
follow
an
interpreter.
there
was
going
to
be
some
testimony
in
spanish.
and
in
essence
he
was
asking
them
whether
or
not...
the
jurors...
whether
or
not
they
could
disregard
what
the
witness
was
going
to
say
in
spanish
and
rely
only
on
the
english
language
rendition
of
that
testimony
provided
by
the
interpreter.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
argue
that
is
a
per
se
violation
of
batson,
given
that
reason.
if
i
might
just
continue
to
give
you--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--we
don't--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--your
honor,
we
don't...
we
don't
dispute
the
opportunity
challenge
for
cause,
but
we
do
argue,
as
you
said,
that
a
prosecutor
could
not
exercise
a
peremptory
challenge.
and
if
i
might
explain
why
i
think
that
rule
should
be
applied.
it's
very
clearly
because
the
prosecutor
has
not
learned
anything
about
the
individual
juror.
the
prosecutor
has
learned
simply
that
this
juror
has,
as
other
bilingual
jurors,
an
understanding
of
spanish
that
the--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--the
prosecutor
here
said
that
he
believed
that
these
jurors
were
hesitant
in
their
responses
in
that
they
said
that
i
will
try
to
follow
that
instruction.
later,
i
must
say
that
all
these...
both
jurors
affirmed
that
they
could
and
would--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--follow
the
instruction.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
he
made
no
specific
finding,
your
honor,
but
he
did
deny
the
motion.
we
are
not
arguing,
your
honor,
that
the
reason
stated
was
not
his
reason.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
believe
that
the
real
reason
is
the
spanish
language
ability
of
these
jurors.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
we
do...
it
does
require
finding
an
intent.
but
what
is
at
issue
here
is
essentially
that
these
jurors
answered
the
questions
in
the
way
that
every
other
bilingual
juror
would.
that
the
nature
of
what's
being
asked
and
the
difficulty
that
bilingual
jurors
face
in
giving,
as
an
initial
response,
anything
more
than
i
will
try,
is
an
honest
response.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
it
is
a
form
of
stereotype,
but
it's
an
appropriate
one
in
this
setting,
because...
let
me
examine...
let
us
examine
what's
being
asked
of
these
jurors.
this
court
has,
on
a
number
of
occasions,
recognized
the
difficulty
that
jurors
generally
have
in
disregarding
things
that
are
said
in
court,
evidence
that's
been
provided
in
court
even
when
instructed
to
do
so
by
the
judge.
it's
particularly
difficult
for...
to
do
what
these
bilingual
jurors
had
been
asked
to
do.
they
had
been
asked,
essentially,
to
disregard
the
words
of
the
witness
from
his
or
her
mouth
that
they
understand
and
take
instead
an
english
language
rendition
of
that.
to
do
so
creates
two
problems
in
minimum
for
these
jurors.
one,
it
runs
against
their
natural
inclination.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
our
argument.
that's
absolutely
right.
we
believe
that
the
reluctance
demonstrated
or
the...
or
the
i-will-try
answers
here
are
the
kinds
of
answers
that
would
be
given
by
every
bilingual
juror--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--who
honestly...
excuse
me...
who
honestly
reflects
on
the
questions
that
he's
being
asked
to
answer.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
absolutely
correct,
that
that
relying--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
the
connection
between
national
origin
and
language
is
a
clear
one,
your
honor.
it
is
something
that...
that
this
court
has
looked
to
and
relied
on
in
yu
cong
eng--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--we
don't
dispute
that
in
the
least,
your
honor.
these
jurors
said
that
they
would
and
could
and
the
court
is...
would
presume
that
they
would
follow
the
court's
instructions.
what
we're
saying
is
that
initially,
in
response
to
these
questions,
the
hesitancy
that
triggered
the
exclusion
of
these
jurors
is
the
natural
and
foreseeable
hesitancy
that
would
be
found
in
all
bilingual
people.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
we
do
not,
your
honor.
but
the
instructions
that...
that
normally
accompany
an
interpreter
are
just
that,
that
you
have
to
disregard
what
you
hear
in
spanish
and
rely
on
what
you
hear
in
english.
the
problem--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--well,
i
don't
know
if
it
makes
a
distinction
in
the
minds
of
the
juror,
your
honor,
because
what's
at
issue
is
whether
or
not
they
can
essentially
screen
out
what
it
is
that
they
hear
in
spanish.
and
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
easy
process
to
do,
and
i
obviously
the
literature
that
we
have
cited
to
in
our
briefs,
one
empirical
study
and
a
number
of
linguistics...
experts
have...
studies
have
demonstrated
that
it's
very
difficult
to
do
just
that...
to
identify
at
some
point
what
it
is
you've
heard
in
one
language
as
it
opposed
to
another,
because
it's
coming
in.
it's
something
that
you're
going
to
understand.
and
what
i...
what
i
don't
want
this
court
to
believe
is
that
we
think
that...
that
a
juror
has
a
right
to
disregard
what
the
interpreter
says.
we're
not
saying
that.
these...
these
jurors
agree
that
they
could
and
that
they
would
rely
on
what
the
interpreter
said.
all
we're
saying
is
that
this
initial
response
will
impact
on
every
bilingual
juror.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
they
said
that
they
would
try,
and
then
they
affirmed
that
they
would.
and
i--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--your
honor,
if...
if
that's
the
distinction,
then
i
don't
think
it's
a
very
meaningful
one
in
most
settings.
if,
in
fact,
you
can
point
as
a
prosecutor
to
these
initial
hesitant
responses
anytime
you'd
want
to,
it
means
that...
that
you
can
eliminate
bilingual
latino
jurors
from
a
jury
anytime
you
want
to.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
your
honor,
we
think
that
it
is
a
per
se
violation,
that
credibility
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
that
by
relying
on
the
i-will-try
answers
of
these
jurors,
the
prosecutor's
relying
on
the
spanish
language
ability
of
these
jurors.
the
court
of
appeals,
for
example,
recognized
that
these
jurors
answered
in
the
way
they
did
as
a
resalt
of
their
spanish
language
ability.
and
that
same
spanish
language
ability
makes
it
difficult
for
every
other
bilingual
person
to
answer
these
questions.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
your
honor,
i...
you're
absolutely
correct.
and
we're
not
trying
to
argue
that.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
in
cases
in
which
there
is
going
to
be
testimony
in
spanish
or
maybe
testimony
in
spanish,
a
prosecutor
with
the
will
to
do
so
can
simply
ask
these
same
kinds
of
questions,
get
these
same
types
of
hesitant
i-will-try
responses,
rely
on
those,
and
knock
out
those
jurors.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
your
honor,
the...
there
is
no
difference
between
somebody
who
does
it
unconsciously
and
somebody
who
does
it
consciously.
the
effect
is
that
you're
relying
on
a
trait
of
national
origin
to
accomplish
what
you
want.
for
example,
if
this
prosecutor
had
said,
i
did
not
exclude
these
jurors
because
they're
latino.
i
excluded
them
because
they
have
spanish
surnames.
and
i've
had
real
bad
luck
with
spanish
surname
jurors.
spanish
surnames
doesn't
include
all
latinos.
it
includes
people
who
are
not
latino,
who...
many
women
who
marry
latino
men,
yet
i
think
it
would
not
be...
that
this
court
would
find
under
batson
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
batson.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
okay,
and
then
what
happens?
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
for
cause.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
for
cause,
because
he
says
i
can't
do
that.
i
won't
do
that.
then--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--and
if
in
the
context
of
that
voir
dire,
he
concedes
that
he
will
and
can,
our
position
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
between
that
juror
and
one
shows
less
hesitancy.
that
the
peremptory
challenge
is
still
based
on
the
language
ability
of
that
juror,
and
as
such,
would
impact
and
effectively
mean
that...
the
prosecutor
in
that
same
setting,
if
i
might
go
back
and
respond
a
little
clearer...
there's
another
juror
in
that
case,
too,
who
just
says,
i'll
try.
and
he
says,
well,
you'll
have
to
do
more
than
try,
you'll
have
to
do
it.
and
i'll
do
it.
so
you
have
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum
that
the
i
will
try,
and
at
the
other,
grave,
grave
difficulty.
i
don't
think
this
court
can
distinguish
between
those,
or
any
court
can
distinguish
between
those,
when
it's
a
peremptory
challenge,
because
the
prosecutor
has
to
do
more
than
point
to
a
reason
for
his
peremptory
challenge.
in
both
cases,
he'd
have
a
reason.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
we
don't
argue
that
he
can't
for
cause,
but
we
argue
that
by
allowing
a
prosecutor
to
do
it
with
peremptory
challenges,
allows
him
in
essence
to
exclude
any
time
he
wants...
in
which
there...
anytime...
in
a
trial,
as
judge
souter
pointed
out...
justice
souter
pointed
out...
where
there's
going
to
be
testimony
in
spanish,
a
bilingual
latino.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i
am
not,
your
honor,
and
if
i
might--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--fine,
and
i'll...
fine.
if
i
could
try
to
give
you
why
i
think
it's
different
from
a
disparate
impact
analysis.
if,
for
example,
a
prosecutor
was
concerned
with
cross-racial
identifications.
he
had
a
black
defendant
and...
to
be
tried...
and
a
white
witness
that
was
going
to
make
the
identification,
he
might
ask
the
jurors
if
they
could
rely
on
the
cross-racial
identification
of
a
white
witness
of
a
black
defendant.
it
might
be
empirically
true
that
more
african-americans
would
say,
i
have
some
questions
about
the
reliability
of
whites
identifying
black
defendants,
with
my
history
that
i've
been
misidentified,
and
i
know
that
it's
maybe
a
problem.
but
i
can
put
that
aside,
and
i'll
try
this
case
fairly.
the
prosecutor
exercises
he
peremptory
challenge,
knocks
off
that
black
juror.
disparate
impact
in
a
broad
sense
in
that
you
could
probably
demonstrate
empirically
that...
that
more
african-americans
might
have
difficulty
in
that
setting.
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
the
difference
between
our
case
and
that
case
is
that
it
is
an
individual
determination
that...
there's
something
individual
in
that
juror's
response
that
is
being
brought
forth
from
the
voir
dire.
here,
all
that
is
coming
forth
is
that
i
speak
spanish.
i
can...
going
to
hear
what
that
witness
says.
i
will
try
to
follow
the
interpreter,
and
i
will
follow
the
interpreter.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that
was
my
10-minute
buzzer,
but--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--i
really--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--your
honor,
if
i
might
just
finish...
finish
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
thank
you.
the
difference
i
think
is
that
the
jurors
in
our
case
were
excluded
because
of
a
national
origin
trait:
spanish
speaking.
the
jurors
in
this
hypothetical
are
excluded
because
of
their
individual
responses
to
questions.
we
think
that
there's
a
causal
relationship,
a
direct
causal
relationship
between
speaking
spanish
and
these
i-will-try
responses.
in
the
hypothetical,
although
there
may
be
some
impact,
the
fact
is
that
there's
no
direct
causal
relationship
between
the
hesitancy
that
that
individual
black
juror
showed...
afro-american
juror
showed...
and
his
or
her
responses.
secondly,
i
think
the
distinction
that...
that
in
that
case,
there
was
a
case-specific
fact
that
is
going
to
be
resolved
by
those
jurors,
that
is,
whether
or
not
this
identification
is
accurate.
in
our
case,
it
is
not.
there
is
no
issue
presented
in
this
case
or
cases
in
which
testimony
is
being
provided
in
spanish
that
is
at
issue.
it's
not
as
if
it's
a
case-specific
issue.
and
thirdly,
there's
a
showing
of
specific
bias
and
by
that
i
mean
the...
in
the
hypothetical
case,
the
black
african-american
juror,
demonstrates
a
potential
bias
against
the
prosecution
or...
or
favor
for
the
defendant.
in
our
case,
the
juror
shows
neither
a...
bent...
a
partial
bias
for
the
defendant
or
an
antithesis...
antithetical
position
to
the
state.
i
think
that
is
what
really
separates
ours,
and
why
we
think
it's
very
narrow.
while
it's
very
important,
it's
very
narrow
at
the
same
time.
we
do
not
encompass
disparate
impact.
and
i
think
it's
my
hypothetical--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
no,
it
rests
on
the
fact
that
that
is
a
part
of
his
national
origin...
that
is
the
name.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
we're
looking
at
traits
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
context
that
have
led
to
discrimination.
after
all,
the
most
derogatory
remark
directed
at
latinos
is
spic,
and
that
comes
from...
from
a...
a
characterization
of
how
somebody
might
say
i
speak
english,
based
on
language.
the
congress
has
enacted
numbers
of
provisions
and
regulatory
agencies
to
protect
language
minorities.
spanish
surname
is
a
basis
by
which
the
census
counts
latinos.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
well,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--that...
that
might
be,
but
i...
but
i
think
that
had
a
trial
judge
found
so,
it
would
still
be
a
per
se
question
before
this
court,
and
not
one
clearly
erroneous.
in
the
same
way
that
we
ask
this
court
to
address
this
question
as
a
per
se
violation,
the
reliance
on
a
per
se
violation
is
very
important,
because
it...
you
can't
prove
pretext,
because
if
you
go
from
the
will...
i
will
try
to
the
very
difficult,
you
always
have
something
on
the
record.
secondly,
as
i
point
out,
it
doesn't
undermine...
a
per
se
rule
does
not
undermine
the
primary
purpose
of
peremptory
challenges,
which
is
to
eliminate
jurors
that
are
potentially
biased.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
if
i
just
might
put
one
more
point
on
this,
because
we
believe
that
the
second
question
doesn't
affect
us
because
we
have
a
per
se
violation
here.
but
let
me
just
put
one
more
point
here
which
is
that
the...
there
is
a
nondiscriminatorial
alternative.
i
think
in
the
context
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that's
very
valid.
they
can
be
instructed
if
there's
a
difference
to...
to
pass
a
note
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
will
clarify
it.
you
do
not
have
to
eliminate
these
people
as
a
group.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
well,
that...
that's
right,
but
we
wouldn't
be
talking
per
se.
we'd
be
talking
pretext.
but...
but
that's
not
our
case,
and
that's
what
we
think
the
jurors
would
say,
if
they
honestly
answer
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
one,
there
may
be
a
question
of
a
prima
facie
case,
but
i
would
still
be
here.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i
would
still
be
here,
your
honor,
because
in
the
context
of
explaining
those
reasons,
for
striking
those
jurors,
he
would
say
just
what
we've
said.
and
he
could
point
to
something
on
the
record--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--your
honor,
it's
not
a
question
of
motive
being
good
or
bad.
it's
a
question
about
whether
the
answer
is
a
neutral
one,
and
we
believe
that
an
answer
based
on
language
cannot
be
neutral
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
under
batson.
quickly
turning
to
point
two...
i'm
sorry.
obviously
we
think
we
have
per
se
violation
here.
we
think
the
plenary
review,
therefore,
is
appropriate
by
this
court.
this
court
has,
however...
if
this
court
does
not
find
per
se...
consistently
applied
the
independent
review
in
jury
discrimination
cases
starting
in
norris...
with
norris
v.
alabama
in
1935
continuing
right
up
to
the
present.
we
don't
think
that
it
any
reason
not
to
comply
with
those
earlier
precedents.
they're
not--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--that...
absolutely
should,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
independent
review
as...
as...
and
its
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact...
that
the
appellate
court
would
give
deference
to
findings
of
credibility
and
other
factual
findings.
but
the
ultimate
question
or
the
question
of
constitutional
importance
is
whether
or
not
that
shows
intent
to
discriminate.
in
most
cases,
it
will
be
simple.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's...
that's--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--that's
correct.
it's
an
issue
of
credibility.
but
if
you
take
all
that
into
account,
and
then
you...
let
me
back
up
by
when
you
say
truthful.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
his
denial
of
discrimination
is
not
sufficient.
but
if
his
reason
is
that
i
knocked
off
juror
2,
because
he
had
some
hesitancy
about
cross-racial
identification,
the
court
can
find
that...
it
to
be
his
reason.
but
if
the
appellate
court
sees
that
three
non-african-americans
show
the
same
hesitancy
as
the
african-american
that
was
knocked
off,
in
light
of
all
those
subsidiary
facts,
it
could
find--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--clearly
erroneous
or
it
find
as...
without
determining
clearly
erroneous
under
independent
review,
that
it
would
find
discrimination
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
did
not.
so
that
the
credibility--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--the
truthfulness
as
to
his
statement
is
that
he
said
this,
that,
and
the
other.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
but
the
constitutional
question
is
is
whether
his
true
reason
is
race
or
national
origin,
and
that
i
guess
is
where
i--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--it
is...
it
is
what
he
says
is
his
reason,
and
therefore,
the
court
will
treat
it
as
such.
but
if
there
are
other
indicia
in
the
record
that
would
lead
a
court
to
another
conclusion
that
this
court
or
any
appellate
court
could
rely
on
those
other
facts...
in
the
first
amendment
area--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
cohen.
