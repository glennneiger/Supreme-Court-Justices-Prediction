justice
souter
but
this...
this
is
true
in
any
case,
when
you've
got
a
juror
who
is
bilingual.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
peculiar
to
the
situation
in
which
the
juror
happens
to
speak
the
same
language
as
one
of
the
witnesses
who
is
a
member
of
the
ethnic
group
that
includes
the
defendant.
justice
souter
yeah,
but--
justice
souter
well,
you've...
you've
argued
the
case
as
if
the
juror
was
being
asked
to
completely
disregard
what
he
or
she
heard.
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
if
that's
what
the
prosecutor
said.
he
said,
i
want
to
be
sure
that
they
would
accept
the
interpreter
as
the
final
arbiter,
that
is
to
say
if
there
was,
i
suppose,
some
dispute
in
the
person's
mind
as
to
what
he
said.
now,
that's
different
from
saying
that
he
must
disregard
every
nuance.
that's
quite
different
it
seems
to
me.
we
don't...
and
incidentally
i
take
it
we
don't
have
the
actual
transcript
of
what
went
on
in
the
voir
dire?
justice
souter
well,
except
that
the
correlation
is
never
going
to
be
what
you
say
it
is,
because
in
the
first
place,
as
i
understand,
somewhere
in
the
briefs,
the
statement
is
made
that
about
25
percent
of
those
who
are
ethnically
latino
do
not
speak
spanish.
so
you've...
you've
got
a
class
of
25
percent
right
off
the
bat,
if
that's
correct,
it
will
not
be
eliminated.
and
in
addition
to
that,
you
cannot
assume
that
in
every
case
in
which
there
maybe
a
latino
defendant
there
is
going
to
be
a
translation
problem.
so
you
then
have
another
category
that's
eliminated.
and
once
you
eliminate
those
two
categories
from
your
argument
for
correlation,
you
don't
have
an
argument
that
this
particular
criterion
is
going
to
eliminate
every
latino
juror.
justice
souter
but
you're
now
telling
us
that
even
on
the
assumption
that
that
is
the
prosecutor's
real
reason
and
not
merely
a
covert
reason
to
eliminate
an
ethnic
group,
that
that
cannot
be
done.
and
i
thought
the
reason
you
were
telling
us
that
could
not
be
done
is
that
it
would
effectively
eliminate
or
give
prosecutors
the
opportunity
to
eliminate,
in
this
particular
case,
every
latino
juror
from
a
case
in
which
there's
a
latino
defendant.
and
we
know
that's
not
so.
justice
souter
well,
then
the
question
is,
what
is
the
permissible
criterion
and
what
is
a
impermissible
one?
i
think
i
infer
from
your
earlier
remarks
that
it's
proper
for
the
judge
to
instruct
the
jurors,
if
you
can
understand
this
foreign
language,
i
am
instructing
you
that
you
must
abide
by
what
the
interpreter
said.
that's
the
record
in
this
case,
and
that's
how
you
must
decide
this
case.
do
you
agree
that
the
judge
could
instruct
the
jury
that?
justice
souter
now,
suppose
a
juror
says,
well,
judge,
i
can't
do
that.
justice
souter
is
that
grounds
for
excusing
the
juror?
justice
souter
for
cause
or
peremptory
either
way.
justice
souter
in
other
words
you're
saying
the
impact
is
never
enough,
but
the
impact
may
be
evidence
which
on
the
total
evidence
of
the
case
is
sufficient
to
tip
it
in
favor
of
a
conclusion
that
there
was
intentional
discrimination.
justice
souter
mr.
cohen,
let
me
ask
your...
ask
you
a
question
about
the
way
the
rule
that
you
would
have
us
apply
might
be
applied
to
other
ethnic
groups.
what
if
we
were
dealing
in
a...
in
a
different
time
period
in
the
history
of
latin
emigration
so
that
in
fact
it
would
be
true
to
say
that
virtually
every
juror
with
a
latin
name
would
be
a
spanish
speaker
and
it
would
also
probably
be
true
that
any
case
in
which
there
was
going
to
be
a
latin
defendant
would
probably
involve
some
translation
so
that
we
would
have
on
these...
on
the
criteria
that
you
proposed
to
allow,
we
would...
we
would
really
have
an
exclusion
of
every
latin
surnamed
juror
who
hesitate
in
any
way.
is
there
anything
in
our
jurisprudence
that
would
say,
even
assuming
on
these
ethnically
neutral
grounds,
that
the
exclusion
would
be
appropriate,
we
nonetheless
will
not
allow
it?
would
there
be
any
reason
for
us
to
conclude
that?
