justice
stevens
--may
i
just
question
that?
you
say
you
don't
encompass
disparate
impact.
but
doesn't
your
latino
name
example
rest
on
a
disparate
analysis?
justice
stevens
well,
but
it
isn't
always.
justice
stevens
and
it
may
well
be
true
that
the
prosecutor
is
100
percent
sincere
in
believing
that
people...
if
he's
had
bad
experience
with
the
people
with
latino
names.
justice
stevens
mr.
cohen,
i
know
what
we
said
in
batson.
i'm
curious
to
know
what
your
answer
to
my
question
is.
justice
stevens
what
you're
saying
it
that
would
be
a
permissible
reason
on
the
facts
i've
given
you?
justice
stevens
of
course,
you
could
do
that,
but
you're
suggesting
that
even
if
that's
not
the
fact,
they
regard
the
importance
of
not
following
the
translator
as
more
important
than
the
interest
in
having
a
diverse
jury,
that's
still
permissible.
and
i...
it
certainly
fits
within
the
language
of
batson,
but
i
just
wanted--
justice
stevens
--is
there
any
limit
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
reason
that
must
be
given
as
long
as
it's
in
good
faith?
supposing,
for
example,
the
prosecutor
had
a
prejudice
against...
a
prejudice
against
people
who
wore
bow
ties--
[laughter]
--that
happened
that
all
the
blacks
on
the
jury
wore
bow
ties,
would
that
be
a
sufficient
reason,
even
it's
truthful?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
infer
prejudice...
but
i'm
assuming
that
the...
i'm
assuming
that
he
knows
the
prosecutor
and
he
knows
he
wouldn't
misrepresent
something.
he
just
happens
to
have
an
idiosyncratic
view
about
a
particular
characteristic
of
people.
and
he
just
gets
all
those
off,
but
it
happens
in
the
case
that's
the
only
reason
he...
he
excused
all
of
the
latinos
or
all
of
the
blacks.
it's
nevertheless
okay?
justice
stevens
mr.
cohen,
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing?
you
stressed
the
case-related
character
of
this
particular...
you're
not
conceding,
i
don't
suppose,
that
the
reason
must
be
case
related?
you
just
argue
that
that's
factor
that
tends
to
support
the
conclusion
there
was
not
a
pretext,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
no,
but
you're
not
conceding
that
the
universe
of
race-neutral
reasons
is
limited
to
case-related
reasons?
justice
stevens
no.
you
could,
for
example,
have
a
prejudice
against
bank
employees
or
something
like
that
and
just
challenge
all
those.
justice
stevens
oh,
or
even
you've
said
not
in
the
facts
and...
oh,
i
see.
discrimination
has
to
be
in
the
case.
what
if...
what
if
the
prosecutor
says,
i
have
no
racial
biases,
but
i
have
found
in
my
experience
that
people
with
dark
skins
are
not
as
good
jurors
as
other
people?
justice
stevens
you
know,
there
are
some
swarthy
caucasians
who
are
eliminated,
but
overwhelmingly
that
criterion
leads
to
the
categorical
exclusion
of
blacks.
justice
stevens
i'd
like
to
push
justice
scalia's
example
one
step
further.
supposing
his
example
of
swarthy,
dark-skinned
people...
supposing
the
prosecutor
could
show
and
he
tries
dozens
of
cases
before
the
same
judge
and
he'd
done
it.
the
judge
had
seen
him
regularly
exclude
people
with
a
swarthey
complexion.
so
he
knows
he's
telling
the
truth.
it
just
happens
that
about
70
percent
of
them
were
also
afro-americans.
justice
stevens
your
hypothetical
about
non-latinos
having
the
same
hesitation
assumes
that
the
prosecutor
asked
the
same
question
to
the
non-latino,
which
i
guess
he
didn't
even
do
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
did
he
ask
everybody
on
the
panel
if
they
spoke
spanish?
justice
stevens
mr.
cohen,
can
you
tell
me
based
on
your
experience
with
these
case,
because
i
guess
it's...
it
is
a
problem
that
this
sort
of
thing
happens
in
new
york
a
great
deal.
is
there
a
standard
instruction
that
the
trial
judges
give
to
the...
those
who
are
bilingual
to
say,
be
sure
you
adhere
to
the
translation
given
by
the
translator
rather
than
your
own
views?
justice
stevens
it
must
come
up
repeatedly
i
would
think,
because
there
must
a
number
of
bilingual
jurors
and
i
would
think
the
prosecutor
would
always
be
concerned...
have
the
same
concern
you
described.
justice
stevens
i
know.
justice
stevens
he
doesn't
explain
it
on...
as
far
as
you
know
there's
not
a
standard...
it
seems
to
me
it
might
be
something...
be
worth
considering.
