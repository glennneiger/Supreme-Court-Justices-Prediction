justice
scalia
what
about
a
man's
wallet
that's
still
in
his
jacket
pocket?
justice
scalia
you
mean
by
allowing...
when
i
consent
to
have
a
policeman
search
my
car,
i
am
also
consenting
to
a
personal
search?
justice
scalia
it
wouldn't?
i
mean,
he
reaches
in
and
he
grabs
my
wallet.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
well,
but
you
have
already
abandoned
in...
i
think
in
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
and
in
your
current
answer,
the
proposition
that
the
only
determinant
of
the
scope
of
the
search
is
what
you're
looking
for.
that
once
you...
once
you
tell
the
person
in
the
car
what
you're
looking
for,
that
determines
the
scope.
if
you're
looking
for
beads
you
can
look
in
very
small
containers.
if
you're
looking
for
elephants
you
can't.
justice
scalia
well,
but
you're
using
something
else
in
telling
me
that
you
can't...
i
mean,
my,
i
am
in
the
car.
my
wallet
is
in
the
car,
in
my
jacket.
my
jacket's
in
the
car.
but
you're
saying
the
consent
does
not
reasonably
extend
to
that,
right?
justice
scalia
oh,
all
right.
justice
scalia
i
see.
and
so--
justice
scalia
--likewise,
when
you
say
may
i
look
into
your
car,
i
assume
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
implied,
it
does
not
say
may
i...
may
i
look
into
locked
trunks
in
your
car,
right?
it
doesn't--
justice
scalia
--your
answer
to
him
was
you
couldn't
pick
the
lock,
right?
you
could
not.
justice
scalia
oh.
well,
what
happened
with
the
paper
bag
here?
was
there
any
objection
when--
justice
scalia
--well,
why
don't
you
use
that
ground
here
instead,
i
mean,
you
could
say
no
matter
what
the
initial
permission
was,
when
there
was
no
objection
to
looking
in
the
bag,
i
guess,
was
that
permission
to
look
in
the
bag?
justice
scalia
or
does
that
only
work
for
trunks
and
not
for
bags?
justice
scalia
a
burlap
bag
is
presumably
somewhere
in
between,
right?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
cheap
or
expensive,
i
gave
no
such
consent.
justice
scalia
so
you
at
least
wouldn't
rip
the
bag?
you
wouldn't
rip
the
bag?
justice
scalia
you
don't
necessarily
say
that
that
includes
purses
as
well,
do
you?
justice
scalia
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked.
justice
scalia
you
could
draw
a
line
between
the
paper
bag
and
a
purse?
justice
scalia
a
purse.
justice
scalia
it
wasn't
left
in
the
car.
it
is
being
clutched
in
the
hands
of
the
woman
passenger.
justice
scalia
okay.
right.
justice
scalia
what
if
it's
just
lying
next
to
her
on
the
seat?
justice
scalia
oh,
it
depends
on
whether
she
is
holding
it
or
it's
next
to
her
on
the
seat?
my
goodness.
justice
scalia
so,
it's
really
a
different
case
you're
talking
about
when
you
say
if
he
had
asked
to
search
the
bag
he
would
not
have
given
his
consent?
you're
talking
about...
it
becomes
a
different
case
because
by
asking
to
search
the
bag
you
give
him
knowledge
that
this
defendant
didn't
have?
justice
scalia
although
all
that
you
can
find,
if
you
go
that
far,
even
behind
the
seats,
the
visors,
into
the
seats,
it's
okay
if
you
find
loose
powder,
loose
cocaine
powder.
but
if
you
find
a
packet
that
has
something
in
it
that
rather
feels
like
cocaine
powder,
but
you
don't
know
for
sure,
you
can't
open
the
packet?
justice
scalia
i
see.
it's
not
a
search
of
the
package
to
squeeze
it
and
feel
it?
that
does
not
constitute
a
search
of
the
package?
justice
scalia
but
that
was
their
mistake
here,
they
didn't
feel
the
paper
bag
first.
had
they
just
squeezed
the
paper
bag
a
couple
of
times,
then
it
would
have
been
okay?
justice
scalia
i
am
trying
to
think
what
the
reasonable
import
of
my
expression
is
when
i
tell
somebody
he
can
search
the
car
for
cocaine.
i
cannot
imagine
it
does
not
mean
that
he
can
look
inside
packages.
nobody
carries
cocaine
strewn
about,
powder
loose
on
the
floor.
it
seems
to
me
i'm
reasonably
saying
if
you
can
find
a
package
that
contains
it,
go
ahead.
justice
scalia
all
your
client
had
to
say
is,
when
he
reached
for
the
bag,
was
hey
wait
a
minute,
i
said
you
could
search
the
car,
but
not
the
bag.
and
that
would
have
stopped
it
right
away,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
but
then
that's
just
saying
that
our
consent
law
is
wrong.
that,
you
know,
more
advice
is
required
than
was
required
in
schneckloth,
for
example.
justice
scalia
but
that's
contrary
to
the
thrust
of
schneckloth,
and
i
think
contrary
to
the
thrust
of
scott
against
united
states,
too,
where
you're
talking
about
an
objective
standard,
reasonable
inferences
to
be
drawn
from.
why
not
just
leave
it
at
that?
because
your
client
would
lose
this
case,
of
course.
justice
scalia
so
you
say
this
case
should
come
out
the
way
you
want
even
if
the...
even
if
the
officer
had
said
do
you
mind
if
i
search
packages
in
your
car?
because
even
then
he
would
have
been
deceptive.
he
really
wasn't
at
all
concerned
about
other
packages.
all
he
was
concerned
about
was
the
proverbial
brown
paper
bag,
right?
justice
scalia
but
not
according
to
your...
to
the
theory
you're
saying
now.
you're
saying
that
that
would
still
be
deceptive
because
he
really
wasn't
interested
in
all
packages.
he
knew,
or
suspected
there
was
something
in
that
brown
paper
bag.
justice
scalia
but
that's--
justice
scalia
--that's
what
the
argument
is
here.
that
when
you
say
search
the
xx
that
includes
notification
that
it
means
search
whatever
packages
are
in
the
car.
i
mean,
that's
just
back
to
your
first
argument.
it's
not
an
additional
argument.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
do
with
a
room?
suppose,
suppose
a
police
officer
asks
for...
i
assume
it
follows
from
your
theory
that
if
he
gets
consent
to
search
the
room
for
drugs
he
can
go
in
the
room,
but
he
can't
open
any
drawers
or
closets
or
anything?
justice
scalia
but
that
isn't
the
issue.
i
mean,
the
issue
is
that
what
i
mean
when
i
say
sure,
search
the
room.
is
that
what
i
mean,
you
can
just
walk
in
and
look
around
the
walls
but
you
can't--
justice
scalia
--i
said
search
the
room,
not
look
around
the
room.
i
said
search
the
room.
when
somebody
searches
a
room
he
pokes
around,
looks
under
things,
opens
drawers,
and
so
forth.
and
isn't
it
the
same
thing
when
we
say
search
a
car?
justice
scalia
mr.
weiner,
how
does...
i
confess
never
having
gotten
a
search
warrant
and
never
having
been
a
policeman
or
having
a
client
served
one.
how
does
a
search
warrant
read?
if
you
get
a
search
warrant
to
search,
to
search
a
home
or
to
search
a
room,
does
it
specifically
say
that
you're
authorized
to
open
drawers
and
look
in
closets
and
so
forth?
justice
scalia
why
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
maybe
a
good
test
of
what
the
import
of
language
is.
when
you
say
you
can
search,
does
it
mean
you
can
look
in
things?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
i'm
just
talking
about
the
language.
i
mean,
a
warrant
is
directed
to
the
officer
and
the
judge
says
something
to
the
officer.
if
the
judge
just
says
you
shall
search
these
premises--
justice
scalia
--and
if
that
is
alone
enough
to
mean
to
the
officer
that
he
can
look
in
drawers,
or
if
it
says
you
shall
search
this
car,
and
that
is
enough
to
mean
to
the
officer
that
he
shall
look
inside
packages,
i
think
that
that
would
be
strong
indication
that
it
means
the
same
thing
when
a
private
party
says
it.
