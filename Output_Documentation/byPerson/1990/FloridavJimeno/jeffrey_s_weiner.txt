mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
respecting
privacy,
being
faithful
to
the
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
at
the
same
time
not
hampering
law
enforcement.
in
1982
justice
stevens,
speaking
for
the
court
in
united
states
against
ross,
stated
that
we
reaffirm
the
basic
rule
of
the
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
stated
by
justice
stewart
for
a
unanimous
court
in
mensi
v.
arizona
citing
katz.
searches
outside
the
judicial
process
are
per
se
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
subject
to
only
a
few
specifically
established
and
well-delineated
exceptions.
the
only
one
applicable
here
is
consent.
in
discussing
chadwick,
justice
stevens
noted
that
this
court
recognized
that
a
person's
expectation
of
privacy
in
personal
luggage
is
substantially
greater
than
in
an
automobile.
justice
marshall
said
a
container,
as
opposed
to
the
car
itself,
does
not
reflect
diminished
privacy
interest.
three
courts
below,
the
trial
court,
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
all
found
that
the
respondent
never
consented
to
allow
office
trujillo
to
search
the
closed
brown
paper
bag.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
think
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
supreme
court's
decision.
i--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do,
because
i
don't
believe
that,
although
the
solicitor
general
urges
that
an
objective
test
be
implemented,
that
that's
the
case.
the
subjective
intent--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--that
is
precisely
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband
was
contained
in
the
vehicle.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
consent
is
valid
only
to
the
extent
that
the
consent
is
given
for.
so
when
the
florida
supreme
court
says
that
consent
to
search
the
car
does
not
include
consent
to
open
packages,
that
is
entirely
consistent
with
an
objective
and/or
a
subjective
reading
of
what
the
individual
consenting
believes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
don't
think
the
florida
supreme
court
necessarily
said
that.
i
believe
what
the
court
said
and
what,
at
least
we
submit
to
the
court,
is
that
if
the
police
officer
says
may
i
search
your
car
and
the
contents
thereof,
then
there
is
no
problem.
but
when
the
request
is
simply
limited
to
searching
the
vehicle,
it
cannot
and
should
not
be
implied
that
that
includes
personalty
and
other
things
that
might
be
in
the
car.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
not
necessarily.
mr.
chief
justice,
there
have
been
several
cases
in
which
searches
of
vehicles
included
searches
behind
the
seats,
searches
under
visors,
under
mats
where
evidence
has
been
found,
and
so
it's
quite
an
extensive
search
that
is
permitted
by
a
consent
to
search
a
car.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
well,
that's
not
necessarily
so.
as
i
understand
the
law,
if
they
are,
if
they
have
valid
consent
to
search
the
car,
in
the
car
they
then
come
across
an
object
which
by
feel,
by
smell,
by
shape
gives
them
probable
cause,
then
ross
would
kick
in
and
they
would
have
an
absolute
right
to
make
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
without
the
necessity
of
a
warrant,
unless
they
previously
focused
on
the
package,
which
would
have
been
the
case
here
if
they
had
probable
cause.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
under
arizona
v.
hicks
it
is
arguable
that
that
is
a
search.
however--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--i
think
that's
precisely
correct,
and
they
could
have...
when
they
had
consent
to
search,
if
he
went
to
the
paper
bag...
my
feeling
is
he
still
would
have
had
to
say
may
i
look
in
the
bag,
or
may
i
look
in
the
containers.
but
once
he
had
permission
even
to
search
the
car,
he
had
a
right
to
move
the
bag
to
do
the
search
of
the
car.
if
at
that
point
he
had
probable
cause,
he
could
go
further.
or
as
justice
o'connor
suggested
in
the
place
case,
they
could
have
brought
in
a
drug
dog
to
sniff
the
car.
there
were
many,
many
options
available
to
the
police
officer.
he
took
none
of
them,
except
going
straight
to
the
bag.
and
this--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--justice
scalia,
there
are
many,
many
cases
at
the
trial
and
appellate
levels
in
which
cocaine
and
other
contraband
is
found
under
mats,
in
glycine
packages
which
are
clearly
visible,
or
the
shape
or
size
or
smell
of
which
clearly
leads
to
probable
cause.
so
this
doesn't
hamper
law
enforcement.
what
it
does
is
not
only
allows
the
police
to
look
into
containers,
but
as
you
suggested,
into
wallets.
and
when
the
magic
word
narcotics
is
used,
it
allows
them
to
go
even
further.
it
allows
them
to
go
inside
a
little
plastic
sleeve
that
contains
pictures,
because
narcotics
could
be
there.
it
allows
them
in
a
purse
to
go
into
a
little
compact,
a
make-up
compact.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
thought
the
state
pretty
much
indicated
that's
what
they
had
in
mind.
the
solicitor
general
said
no.
but
if
anything
is
left
in
the
car,
that's
precisely
what
would
be
the
case.
and
that
is
why
when
someone
says
you
can
search
the
car,
i
don't
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume
they
mean
you
can
search
everything.
and
what
we're
suggesting
is
here,
here,
is
why
should
the
trial
court,
why
should
the
appellate
courts,
why
should
anyone
guess
when
all
the
officer
has
to
say
is
may
i
search
the
bag.
may
i
search
your
wallet.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
well,
it
might
have
stopped
it,
probably
would
have
stopped
it,
but
the
burden
shouldn't
be
on
a
citizen
to
stop
a
police
officer.
here
we
have
three
individuals
who
were
stopped,
number
one,
for
a
traffic
violation.
they
had
not
yet
been
given
the
citation.
number
two,
although
the
officer
said
in
the
testimony
they
were
free
to
leave,
they
couldn't
have
left
while
awaiting
the
issuance
of
the
citation.
and
in
addition,
the
police
officer
said
we
believe
you
have
narcotics
in
the
car,
we
want
to
search
the
car
for
narcotics.
hardly
a
situation
where
a
citizen
would
say
please
don't
look
in
that
bag,
stop
the
search.
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
unrealistic
to
assume
that
a
citizen
is
going
to
exercise
their
rights
in
that
fashion.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
well,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that,
in
this
situation
it
would
be
entirely
proper
for
this
court
to
come
down
with
a
bright-line
rule
saying
if
you
want
consent
to
search
you
must
ask
for
consent
to
search
the
items
in
question.
what
could
be
the
harm?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
don't
think
that
it's
contrary
to
schneckloth.
it
goes
a
little
further
than
schneckloth.
schneckloth
said
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
fact
that
an
individual
was
not
advised
of
his
rights
can
be
considered
as
a
factor.
what
we
are
suggesting
is,
even
among
this
court
i
presume,
most
respectfully,
that
there
is
a
real
question
here,
what
does
it
mean
when
i
say
you
can
search
my
car.
why
guess?
the
easy
way
to
deal
with
it
is
to
simply
have
the
officer
say
what
he
wants
to
do.
it
doesn't
hamper
law
enforcement.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
absolutely.
under
terry
v.
ohio--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--no,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
because
their
character--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--the
difference
is
that
the
intended
use
of
a
holster
could,
is
for
a
weapon,
which
in
many
cases
is
a
violation
of
the
law
if
it's
concealed.
a
paper
bag,
much
as
in
the
case
that
justice
scalia
wrote,
arizona
v.
hicks
regarding
the
stereo
component,
is
not
inherently
a
suspicious
item
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
have
been
several
cases
in
which
brown
paper
bags
have
contained
contraband.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
no,
sir.
i
have
see
some
green
bags,
but
no
brown
bags...
or,
excuse
me,
no
white
bags.
instead
of
asking
for
consent
to
search
the
brown
paper
bag
here,
he
only
asked
to
search
the
car
itself.
what
concerns
me
is
that
the
state
of
florida
in
their
brief,
the
solicitor
general
in
their
brief,
never
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
officer
stated
in
clear
and
unquestioned
terms
at
the
motion
to
suppress
that
he
wanted
one
thing.
he
wanted
in
the
bag.
the
minute
consent
was
given
to
search
the
car,
he
went
to
the
passenger
door,
opened
it
up,
went
right
to
the
brown
paper
bag,
opened
it
up,
and
went
in.
deception
by
the
officer
in
not
asking
for
permission
to
search
the
brown
paper
bag
should
not
be
condoned
by
this
court.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
it's
deceptive
because,
as
in
chadwick,
as
in
arkansas
v.
sanders,
as
in
oklahoma
v.
castleberry,
all
decided
by
this
court,
this
officer's
focus
had
been
on
the
package,
incidental
to
the
car,
before
it
ever
got
to
the
car.
that's
what
he
was
after,
that's
all
he
wanted.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
that
is
true.
however,
those
are
cases
in
which
a
warrant
was
required.
so
particularity
is
necessarily
required
in
applying
for
the
warrant.
in
a
consent
situation
we
have
the
exact
antithesis.
we
have
a
citizen
giving
up
their
fourth
amendment
rights.
therefore,
in
order
to
give
it
up
and
exercise
intelligently
their
waiver
or
relinquishment
of
a
right,
they
should
at
least
know
what
the
officer
is
going
for.
the
standard
shouldn't
be
less.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
think
if
he
said
that
it
would
be
just
fine.
and
then--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--yes,
sir,
but
packages
would
include
notification
that
he
is
going
to
any
packages.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
now--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--in
the
example
you
gave
there
is
one
of
two
things
that
could
happen.
may
i
search
all
packages?
yes.
they
go
straight
to
the
package
in
question.
if
the
package
in
question
is
the
package
in
this
case,
he
would
have
to
get
a
warrant
under
chadwick
and
arkansas
v.
sanders,
which
is
good
law
according
to
this
court
as
recently
as
in
ross
and...
there's
no
question.
but
that's
not
the
only
option.
the
other
options,
as
we
discussed,
is
that
they
have
every
right
if,
in
searching
the
other
packages,
they
smell
or
feel
something
to
go
further
and
then
possibly
parlay
that
into
a
search
of
a
car
based
on
ross,
based
on
numerous
other
exigent
circumstances
which
would
allow
the
search
on
the
spot.
so
law
enforcement
gives
up
nothing
and
loses
nothing.
we
submit
that
a
genuine
intelligent
consent
should
relate
to
the
item
to
be
searched,
and
not
some
general,
vague,
overbroad
statement
that
we'd
like
to
look
in
the
car.
much
the
same
as
if
somebody
is
walking
down
the
street
and
a
police
officer
approaches
them
and
says
i
would
like
to
search
you,
does
that
mean
they
can
search
the
briefcase
or
the
purse
or
the
knapsack
or
the
fanny
pack
or
anything
else
on
that
person?
i
think
not.
this
case
is
a
first
party
consent
case.
justice
blackmun,
concurring
in
ross,
said
it's
important
for
law
enforcement
officials
and
defendants
that
the
applicable
rules
be
well
established.
we
submit
that
an
appropriate
rule
would
be
that
anytime
a
person
manifests
their
expectation
of
privacy
by
utilizing
some
layer
or
form
of
concealment
of
the
thing
or
place
to
be
searched,
the
officer
must
ask
to
search
that
item
or
place
in
order
to
have
a
valid
consent.
it
would
certainly
make
life
easier
for
trial
judges,
as
well
as
appellate
court
judges,
because
no
one
would
have
to
guess.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
well,
the
government,
as
i
recall,
had
a
rough
time
answering
justice
kennedy's
question
whether
if
they
had
a
lock
pick
expert
to
break
in
without
doing
damage,
whether
that
was
okay.
so
they
themselves
don't
even
know
what
the
limits
would
be.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
damage,
but
then
in
a
footnote
he
seems
to
indicate
that
if
it's
a
damage
to
a
paper
bag
because
of
the
tearing
of
tape
it's
okay.
so
in
other
words
if
the
bag
doesn't
rise
to
a
level
of
importance
or
money,
like
the
silk
bag
that
they
were
talking
about,
that's
not
entitled
to
the
same
protection.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
don't
see
any
line-drawing
problems,
because
it's
so
direct
and
fair
and
honest.
may
i
search
the
bag?
what
could
be
easier?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
think
that
when
permission
is
granted
to
search
a
bag,
it
is
implied
that
they
can
go
further
and
search
whatever
is
in
that
bag.
that
is
not
a
problem
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
don't
see
a
problem.
the
consent
was
given
to
search
the
bag
and
what
is
contained
in
that
personalty.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
because
the
car--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--but
since
it's
called
a
car
instead
of
a
bag,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
person
consenting
is
consenting
to
search
the
car
only.
and
it
would
be
mere
speculation
to
assume
that
he
or
she
meant
searching
the
bag
was
included.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
think
that's
exactly
correct.
and
i
don't
think
that
hampers
law
enforcement.
justice
scalia,
what
we
have
had
is
a
series
of
cases--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--no.
it
means
you
can
go
around
and
you
can
look
in
the
room,
anything
in
plain
view
is
perfectly
fine.
as
you
suggested
in
arizona
v.
hicks,
anything
is
fine
as
long
as
you
don't
start
going
into
things.
what
is
the
burden
that
we're
asking?
simply
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
that
reasonable
people
can
differ
as
to
what
the
consent
is.
if
a
police
officer
says
may
i
search
your
home,
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
means
that
the
police
can
go
into
every
nook
and
cranny.
and
when
it's
narcotics
no
papers
are
protected,
nothing
is
protected,
because
narcotics,
as
they
are
fond
of
saying,
can
be
anywhere,
which
is
true.
so
nothing
is
protected.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i
still
think
he
would
have
to
simply
go
one
step
further
and
say
may
i
search
the
room
and
the
contents,
whether
it
be
a
desk,
a
box,
a
purse,
a
package.
why
is
that
burden
too
great
to
ask
of
an
officer?
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say,
since
this
is
consent,
this
is
not--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
that
finding,
because
when
the
trial
judge
said
he
could
have
assumed,
i
think
that
begs
the
question
and
supports
the
position
that
we
are
suggesting,
that
nobody
knows.
he
could
have
assumed
it,
maybe
he
didn't
assume
it,
he
might
have
assumed
it.
we
don't
know.
she
didn't
know.
nobody
knows,
but
she
knew
he
didn't
give
definite
consent.
the
burden
should
always
be
on
the
government
to
justify
the
consent
and
its
scope.
it
shouldn't
be
the
burden
of
the
consenting
individual
to
tell
a
police
officer
to
stop
or
not
to
look
in
the
package.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
it
doesn't
need
to
say
it.
here
is
what
has
happened
as
far
as--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
--i
suggest
it
is
not
a
good
analogy
for
this
reason,
sir.
a
compelled
search
is
very,
very
different
from
a
consent
search.
it
is
the
exact
opposite.
a
compelled
search
the
individual
cannot
resist,
cannot
do
anything
but
sit
there
while
the
search
takes
place.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
weiner
well,
with
all
due
respect,
sir,
i...
there
are
two
things
that
happened
in
the
cases
regarding
search
warrants.
the
first
one
is
that
police
officers
routinely
ask
for
permission
to
search
a
place
and
don't
narrow
it
as
they
are
required
to
do.
typically,
however,
the
search
warrant
gives
them
permission
to
search
everyplace.
even
though
they
may
have
known
that
the
contraband
was
located,
for
example,
in
a
bedroom,
they
will
search
and
tear
apart
the
entire
house.
so
it's
unreasonable,
i
suggest,
sir,
to
assume
that
a
citizen
would
understand
that
giving
consent
to
search
would
be
consent
to
do
everything,
to
look
in
everyplace.
narcotics
knows
no
hiding
places
that
are
too
small.
and
i
don't
believe
the
citizen
understands
that
consent
is
automatically
a
free
for
all
for
the
officer
to
go
anywhere
he
wants.
in
addition,
justice
scalia,
a
search
warrant
commanding
an
officer
to
go
in
and
to
look
for
narcotics
actually
allows
the
tearing
down
of
walls,
in
a
car,
the
going
into
tires.
there
are
no
limits.
so
certainly,
using
your
analogy,
a
citizen
who
says
yes,
you
may
look
isn't
consenting
to
have
his
home
or
car
torn
to
smitherines
because
an
officer
feels
narcotics
might
be
hidden
somewhere.
that's
why
i
don't
think
we
can
draw
the
analogy
between
a
compelled
search
and
a
consent
search.
totally
different.
the
state
of
florida
has
not
demonstrated,
we
submit,
the
need,
the
desire,
the
helpfulness
to
law
enforcement
of
allowing
a
general
search
to
vitiate
the
fourth
amendment
when
the
consent
is
not
asked
for
as
a
particular
item.
society
and
civility
must
respect
a
higher
level
of
privacy
than
what
the
state
of
florida
and
the
solicitor
general
are
suggesting.
if
there
are
no
questions,
that
will
conclude
my
argument.
i
thank
you.
