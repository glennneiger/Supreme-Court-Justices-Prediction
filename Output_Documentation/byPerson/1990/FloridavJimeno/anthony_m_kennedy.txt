when
you
answered
justice
o'connor
and
you
said
that
it's
unreasonable
to
assume
that
there
would
be
consent
to
break
the
lock,
did
you
mean
that
in
the
technical
sense
of
picking
it
or
actually
destroying
it?
suppose
the
police
officer
was
a
good
lock
picker
and
he
could
just
pick
the
lock?
justice
kennedy
no.
my
hypothetical
is
this
is
a
good
lock,
but
he's
a
good
lock
picker.
justice
kennedy
well,
where
do
you
come
out
on
the
question?
does
he
consent
or
does...
is
the
search
lawful
or
is
it
not
lawful
if
there
is
a
strong
lock
but
the
office
is
able
to
pick
it?
justice
kennedy
but
that
seems
to
me
to
contradict
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
defendant...
i
think
the
district
court
said
could
have
assumed
that
the
intent...
the
defendant
could
have
assumed
that
the
officer
would
have
searched
the
bag.
justice
kennedy
how
does
that
square
with
your
answer
that
he,
he
would
not
have
given
the
consent
if
it
had
been
asked
for?
i
don't
see
how
you
square
those.
justice
kennedy
is
your
argument
that
an
objective
test
applies
and
that
in
these
circumstances
a
reasonable
officer
would
assume
that
he
had
the
right
to
search
the
bag
as
well
as
the
interior
of
the
car?
is
that
your
submission?
justice
kennedy
i
understand
that
submission.
i
can't
really
square
it
with
your
answer
that
you
could
have
assumed
that
the...
if
he
had
been
asked
he
would
not
have
given
his
consent.
i
just
can't
square
those.
justice
kennedy
suppose
he's
in
the
room
and
says
may
i
search
the
room?
justice
kennedy
what
do
you
do
with
the
finding
of
fact
here
that
the
driver
could
have
assumed
that,
and
this
is
a
finding
of
fact--
justice
kennedy
--and
i
think
also
reasonable,
that
the
police
would
search
the
bag?
