justice
stevens
may
i
ask
then,
are
you
agreeing
that
the
wells
case
was
correctly
decided?
justice
stevens
so
you
do
agree
wells
was
correctly
decided?
justice
stevens
but
at
least
on
its
facts.
justice
stevens
and
that's
the
only
authority
that
this...
the
florida
court
relied
on
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
well,
but
isn't
it
at
issue
to
this
extent,
the
scope
of
the
consent?
i
mean,
i
understand
it
makes...
doesn't
it
make
some
difference
what
the
officer's
question
is?
if
he
says,
for
example,
may
i
look
in
your
back
seat,
and
the
driver
says
sure,
does
that
sure
mean
he
may
also
open
containers
in
the
back
seat?
justice
stevens
well,
what
were
the
facts
in
this
case?
what
precisely
did
the
officers
say
and
what
did
the
driver
respond?
justice
stevens
but...
i
understand
he
has
reason
for...
i
just
want
to
know
what
he
said.
what
were
the
words
that
gave
rise--
justice
stevens
--are
these
in
the
findings?
because
these
facts
aren't
in
that
much
detail
in
the
briefs.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
what
if
the
top
of
the
bag
had
been
glued
together
so
they
couldn't
get
in
without
tearing
it?
could
they
have
torn
it?
justice
stevens
no,
they
had
to...
just,
i
assume
you
have
to
tear
the
bag
to
see
what's
inside
it,
and
look
through
the
hole.
justice
stevens
no
problem
which
way?
justice
stevens
but
if
it
were
a
silk
purse
it
would
be
different?
justice
stevens
so
the
test
isn't
whether
you
have
to
damage
the
item
to
look
inside
it,
but
whether
you
damage
it
enough
so
it
might
bother
the
owner?
justice
stevens
he
doesn't
have
to
stop
and
say
do
you
mind
if
i
tear
the
bag
and
take
a
look
inside?
justice
stevens
well,
sure
it
would
help.
justice
stevens
but
what
if
you
can't?
justice
stevens
it's
my
bag.
i
mean,
what
do
you
care
how
valuable
it
is?
what
right
do
you
have
to
destroy
it?
i
didn't
give
you
any
authority
to
destroy
my
bag.
i
don't
care
how
valueless
it
is.
it's
mine.
justice
stevens
to
search.
i
didn't
consent
to
you
to
destroy
a
single
thing.
justice
stevens
did
you
say
it's
probably
right
that
if
he
had
known
he
was
asking
to
search
the
bag
he
would
have
refused?
justice
stevens
i
thought
the
position
of
the
state
was
that
they
did
ask
for
consent
to
make
a
search
that
necessarily
included
the
bag?
justice
stevens
but
do
you
know
that
he
means
to
search
the
bag?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it
means
he
intended
to
give
consent
to
search
the
bag
or
not?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
what
do
you
think
his
actual
intent
was?
justice
stevens
no,
do
you...
what
do
you
think
his
actual
intent
was
with
respect
to
searching
the
bag?
justice
stevens
okay,
you
don't
ask--
justice
stevens
--but
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
was
what
do
you
think
his
actual
intent
was
with
respect
to
having
the
bag
searched?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
why
do
you
say
then
that
you
think
if
he
asked
if
he
could
search
the
bag
he
would
have
said
no?
justice
stevens
but
any
container
they
leave
in,
suitcase,
briefcase,
purse,
general
consent
includes
it?
justice
stevens
you
think
that's
a
realistic
assumption?
justice
stevens
do
you
agree
with
florida
that
on
its
facts
the
florida
supreme
court
correctly,
or
i
guess
the
court
of
appeals,
correctly
decided
florida
against
wells?
justice
stevens
what
if
it
could
be
opened,
say
an
ordinary
briefcase
but
not
locked,
just
closed
and
snapped
normally.
what
do
you
do
with
that
case?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
that
occurred
to
me
during
your
opponent's
argument
on
the
question
whether
the
consent
to
search
the
car
gives
authority
that's
coextensive
with
ross
case
probable
cause
or
a
warrant.
because
in
those
cases,
as
your
opponent
points
out,
there
is
damage...
there
can
be,
with
probable
cause,
damage
to
the
car,
or
under
a
warrant.
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
take
that
position
with
respect
to
a
consent
search,
am
i
right?
justice
stevens
but
then
you
are
conceding
that
the
search
pursuant
to
consent
to
search
a
car
is
not
coextensive
with
the
ross
search?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
so
you
think
it's
likely
that
if
he
had
refused
consent
he
could
have
just
left?
justice
stevens
but
that's
not
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stevens
well,
the
answer
is
pretty
obvious.
