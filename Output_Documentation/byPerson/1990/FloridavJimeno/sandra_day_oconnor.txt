justice
o'connor
mr.
neimand,
what
if
the
automobile
had
contained
a
locked
briefcase?
how
would
you
interpret
the
consent
then?
justice
o'connor
how
about
opening
a
woman's
handbag?
it's
a
female
driver
who
consents
to
letting
the
car
be
searched.
she
has
a
handbag
with
her.
justice
o'connor
well,
counsel,
it...
the
florida
supreme
court
appears
to
have
established
here
some
kind
of
a
per
se
rule
when
it
said
that
consent
to
search
a
vehicle
does
not
extend
to
closed
containers
found
inside.
it
seems
to
take
the
view
that
it...
even
under
an
objective
standard,
that
consent
would
never
include
authority
to
open
a
bag.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that's
consistent
with
this
court's
cases?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
in
u.s.
v.
ross
this
court
indicated
that
a
lawful
search
of
a
car
includes
the
right
to
search
containers
within
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
that
consent
is
the
equivalent
of
probable
cause?
it
gives
the
same
authority?
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
court
went
beyond
any
precedence
of
this
court
in
saying
the
consent
just
can't
include
authority
to
open
a
bag.
