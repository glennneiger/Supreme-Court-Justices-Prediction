mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
raises
two
objections
to
the
admissibility
of
the
cocaine.
the
first
focuses
on
the
officer,
what
he
really
knew
as
opposed
to
what
he
said
in
asking
for
consent,
and
the
second
focuses
on
the
defendant,
what
he
must
have
meant
as
opposed
to
what
he
said
in
giving
consent.
first
the
officer.
respondent
argues
that
the
officer
knew
that
what
he
was
looking
for
was
in
the
bag,
and
that
therefore
he
should
have
asked
for
consent
to
search
the
bag.
respondent
surmises
that
the
officer
didn't
do
so
because
jimeno
probably
would
not
have
given
that
consent.
well,
that's
probably
right,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
fourth
amendment
that
requires
the
police
to
disclose
to
a
suspect
everything
they
know
about
him
before
asking
for
consent.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
said
it
was
probably
right
that
if
the
officer
asked
for
consent
to
search
the
bag,
the
defendant
probably
would
have
refused.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
exactly
right,
but
those
are
two
very
different
things.
if
i...
the
officer
comes
up
and
asks
for
consent
to
search
the
car,
you
don't
know
that
he's
on
to
you.
you
don't
know
that
he
knows
about
the
bag.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
exchange
i
am
conducting
an
investigation
for
narcotics,
may
i
search
your
car,
go
ahead,
i
have
nothing
to
hide,
reasonably
conveys
consent
to
search
containers
in
the
car
that
might
contain
the
object
of
the
search.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
did
not
limit
the
consent
he
gave.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
his
intent
was
to
give
a
general
consent
to
search
the
car.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think,
as
the
district
court
found
in
this
case,
he
could
have
assumed
that
the
officer
intended
to
open
the
bag.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'll
try
again.
i
think
he
did,
in
the
consent
he
gave...
he
recognized--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
he
hoped
that
the
officer
would
not
search
the
bag,
but
that
in
giving
a
general
consent
to
search...
he
may
have
harbored
the
hope
that
the
officer
wouldn't
search
the
bag,
but
he
did
not
impose
that
limitation
on
the
general
consent
that
he
gave.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
then
jimeno
would
have
realized
that
the
officer
was
on
to
him,
that
he
knew
about
the
bag,
that
he
knew
that
the
bag
contained
narcotics.
the
officer--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
right.
and
in
giving--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--two
different
situations.
i
think
if
you
ask
for
consent
to
search
the
car
and
you
give
that
consent
without
limitation,
you
can
assume
that
if
the
officer
does
go
ahead
with
the
search
and
comes
across
the
paper
bag
that
he
will
have
understood
your
consent
to
include
opening
the
paper
bag.
now,
in
a
different
case,
if
you
had
gone
ahead
and
said
can
i
search
the
paper
bag
on
the
floor
of
the
passenger
side
of
the
car,
the
defendant
would
probably
realize
that
the
police
were
on
to
him
at
that
point
and
wouldn't
have
given
that
consent.
that
doesn't
mean
that
when
he
gives
a
general
consent
to
search
the
car
he
is
not
also
conveying
a
consent
to
open
closed
containers
that
are
found
within
the
car.
the
respondent's
position--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
mean
if
there
were...
the
passengers
remained
in
the
car?
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
think
it's--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
purse.
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
said
persons.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh.
i
think
the
general
consent
would
include
a
purse
that
was
left
in
the
car
that
was
closed--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
and
if
she
is
still
in
the
car,
i
would
say
no,
it
would
not
necessarily
include
consent
to
search
that,
because
that's
more--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
with
her
as
opposed
to
being
in
the
car.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
i
think
the
general
consent
does
include
that,
because
it's
not--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
when
it's
holding
her,
it's
reasonably
understood
to
be
part
of
her
person,
and
a
general
consent
to
search
the
car
does
not
include
a
search
of
the
person.
but
if
it's
just
lying
in
the
car,
then
i
think
it's
reasonably
understood
that
general
consent
would
include
that.
now,
of
course
they
don't
conduct
a
search
of
the
car
with
people
in
it.
they
ask
the
people
to
leave
before
undertaking
the
search.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
so,
yes.
now,
as
justice
marshall
asked
this
morning,
why
in
the
world,
and
respondent
renews
this
argument,
would
anyone
give
such
a
consent
if
they
knew
that
they
were
carrying
drugs,
and
there
are
many
reasons.
they
do
bluff.
go
ahead,
i
have
nothing
to
hide.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
would
be--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
if
he
didn't
want--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
is
a
possibility
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
if
the
defendant
didn't
want
the
car
searched
he
could
have
said
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
what
took
place
here,
of
course.
i
think
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--where
the
people
refused
consent?
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
immediately,
but
i
am
sure
that
there
could
be
a
case.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
that
from
happening.
the
defendant
could
have
done
it
in
this
case,
or
he
could
have
limited
the
search,
or,
as
i
say,
he
could
have
refused
the
consent
altogether.
now,
why
would
he
consent?
because
they
bluff.
go
ahead,
i
have
nothing
to
hide.
the
officer,
why
bother,
he
obviously
doesn't
have
anything
to
hide.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
and
under
illinois
v.
rodrigues--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
they're
two
different
situations.
if
you
come
up
and
the
officer
says
can
i
have
your
consent
to
search
that
brown
paper
bag
on
the
floor
of
the
passenger
side
that
you
took
out
of
the
apartment
building
an
hour
ago
when
we
were
watching
you,
the
defendant
at
that
point
knows
he
knows
where
it
is,
he's
going
to
find
it.
if
he
says
can
i
search
your
car,
you
don't
know
what
he's
searching
for,
you
may
hope
he
doesn't
search
after
you
have
evidenced
your
willingness
to
go
along
with
it,
you
may
hope
he
doesn't
find
it.
you
may
hope
your
cohorts
have
hidden
it
better.
keep
in
mind
that
there
were
two
people
in
the
car
after
mr.
jimeno
got
out
and
went
around
and
talked
to
the
officer.
maybe
he
had
hoped
in
the
interim
they
would
have
hidden
it
better,
or
maybe
he
was
preparing
a
defense
of
lack
of
knowledge.
maybe
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
right.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
fourth
amendment
that
requires
the
police
to
show
all
their
cards
before
they
ask
an
individual
for
consent.
that's
contrary
to
this
court's
teaching
in
cases
such
as
united
states
against
scott,
which
hold
that
objective
facts
and
not
the
officer's
subjective
motivations
are
determinative
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
now,
every
court
of
appeal,
every
federal
court
of
appeals
to
have
considered
facts
similar
to
those
presented
here
has
concluded,
without
dissent,
that
the
general
consent
to
search
the
car
includes
consent
to
open
closed
containers
within
the
car,
unclosed,
unlocked
containers.
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
is
to
the
contrary,
and
we
think
that
that
decision
should
be
reversed.
now
there
are
limitations
on
the
search.
it's
not
a
free-ranging
consent.
the
limitations
can
come
from
the
request,
i
am
searching
for
illegal
aliens,
may
i
search
your
car.
that
would
not
be
reasonably
understood
to
include
opening
the
glove
compartment.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
because
that
involved
a
locked
container.
and
while
it's
reasonable
to
construe
a
general
consent
to
cover
opening
closed
containers,
we
don't
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
an
individual
would
voluntarily
consent
to
the
destruction
of
their
property.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's,
we
think,
no
different
than
the
rolled-up
paper
bag.
and
that,
since
it's
unlocked,
can
be
opened.
and
we
think...
the
general
consent
to
search
the
car,
if
it
didn't
include
closed
containers,
would,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
in
ross,
not
a
consent
case,
would
be
a
fairly
meaningless
right,
because
contraband,
particularly
narcotics,
is
not
strewn
about
the
car.
it
is
kept
in
containers.
and
therefore
when
jimeno,
in
response
to
the
question
i
am
conducting
a
narcotics
investigation,
may
i
search
your
car,
sure,
go
ahead,
i
have
nothing
to
hide,
i
think
he
knew
that
that
reasonably,
the
officer
would
understand
that
to
include
consent
to
look
in
the
closed
containers.
thank
you,
your
honor.
