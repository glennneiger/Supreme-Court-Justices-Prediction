piedad
jimeno.
mr.
neimand,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
where
was
the
paper
bag?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we'll
recess
here
until
1:00
p.m.
thank
you.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
neimand,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument
in
florida
against
jimeno.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
weiner,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
you
think
a
search
of
the
vehicle
that
is
consented
to,
then,
simply
means
to
search
for
things
that
might
be
spread
over
the
seat
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
assuming
those
are
lying
on
the
seat
rather
than...
i
mean,
no
one
has
suggested,
i
don't
believe,
that
the
sort
of
consent
given
here
would
authorize
the
search
of
the
wallet
contained
in
the
jacket
of
the
driver
when
he
got
out
of
the
car.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
do
you
call
that
deception?
he
told
them
he
was
looking
for
narcotics.
he
asked
for
permission
to
search
the
car.
permission
to
search
the
car
would
give
him
access
to
the
bag.
chief
justice
rehnquist
none
of
those
cases
say
you
must
identify
with
particularity
something
that
could
also
be
covered
by
a
more
general
consent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
any
clear
rule
would,
mr.
weiner.
it
seems
to
me
the
rule
that
the
government
contends
for
here
would
be
equally
clear.
it's
just
that
the
objective
test,
what
are
the
normal
expectations.
i
don't
think
your
rule
gains
in
clarity.
it
may
have
some
other
virtues,
but
it
doesn't
seem
that
your
proposed
rule
is
any
clearer
than
the
government's.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
suggest
that
your
rule
would
present
no
such
line-drawing
problem?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
open
up
that
bag
and
find
four
bags
inside
it?
[laughter]
then
can
you
search
those
four
bags?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though...
suppose
there's
a
wallet
in
the
bag?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
why
shouldn't
the
same
thing,
when
the
consent
is
given
to
search
the
car,
why
shouldn't
they
be
able
to
search
whatever
is
in
the
car?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
car
is
sort
of
a
big
bag.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weiner.
mr.
neimand,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
case
is
that,
mr.
neimand?
chief
justice
rehnquist
horton?
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
neimand.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
third
case
which
i
have
to
announce
is
florida
against
jimeno
no.
90-622.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
louis
jimeno,
was
stopped
by
the
police
in
florida
for
a
traffic
violation.
the
police
asked
him
for
permission
to
search
his
car
for
drugs.
jimeno
gave
his
consent.
the
police
searched
and
discovered
a
paper
bag
containing
a
killer
gram
of
cocaine
on
the
floorboard
of
the
car.
the
florida
supreme
court
suppressed
this
evidence
based
upon
its
view
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
a
general
consent
to
the
search
of
ones
car
does
not
extend
to
close
containers
such
as
the
bag
found
here
in
the
car.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
scope
of
a
consent
search
is
defined
by
the
terms
of
the
consent.
a
police
officer
here
told
jimeno
he
had
reason
to
suspect
there
were
narcotics
in
the
car.
he
asked
for
permission
to
search
it.
jimeno
granted
permission,
placed
no
limitation
on
the
consent.
under
these
circumstances,
it
was
objectively
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
believe
that
jimenos
consent
extended
to
a
paper
bag
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
car,
a
bag
which
might
contain
drugs.
a
reasonable
officer
would
know
that
narcotics
are
generally
carried
in
some
form
of
container.
the
fourth
amendment
requires
only
that
a
search
be
reasonable
under
the
terms
of
the
consent
and
we
hold
that
this
one
was
reasonable.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
joined.
