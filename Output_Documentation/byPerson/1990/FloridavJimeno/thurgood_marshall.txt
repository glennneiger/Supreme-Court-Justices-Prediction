justice
marshall
well,
after
they
found
the
narcotics,
what
use
was
there
in
looking
in
the
rest
of
the
car?
justice
marshall
there
might
have
been
what?
justice
marshall
yeah,
but
why
did
they
have
to
look
for
something
else
after
they
found
narcotics?
justice
marshall
they
didn't
search
any
further?
justice
marshall
because
they
didn't
need
to,
did
they?
justice
marshall
why
was
the
search
valid?
justice
marshall
mr.
neimand,
it's
your
position
that
no
pressure
at
all
was
used
against
the
bag?
justice
marshall
no
threats
or
no
anything?
justice
marshall
the
man
himself
knew
that
he
had
narcotics?
justice
marshall
and
he
knew
that
this
man
was
looking
for
narcotics?
justice
marshall
and
that
if
the
man
found
narcotics
he
was
going
to
jail?
justice
marshall
why
did
he
say
yes,
look?
justice
marshall
sir?
justice
marshall
i'm
listening.
justice
marshall
he's
bluffing?
[laughter]
justice
marshall
well,
let's
not
get
into
how
many
are
not
caught.
justice
marshall
do
you
have
a
single
case
where
a
man
said
you
can
search
the
car
but
you
can't
search
that
paper
bag,
that
brown
paper
bag?
justice
marshall
well,
why
do
you
think
it's
proper
to
say
so?
justice
marshall
is
it
a
possibility?
justice
marshall
but
it's
not
a
probability?
justice
marshall
have
you
any
case
where
the
man
refused
to
let
you
search
the
car
at
all?
why
is
it
true
that
every
time
you
come
up
you
say
please,
i'm
looking
for
dope,
and
the
guy
says
it's
right
here?
does
that
go
for
every
case?
[laughter]
justice
marshall
that's
not
true
for
every
case?
my
answer...
my
question
is
do
you
have
one
case
where
it
didn't
happen?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
xxx.
if
you're
searching
the
car
and
you
see
a
holster,
would
you
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
see
if
there
was
a
gun
in
the
holster?
justice
marshall
second
question.
if
you
find
a
brown
paper
bag,
which
every
law
enforcement
officer
in
the
country
knows
usually
has
narcotics,
would
that
give
you
a
right
to
open
it?
justice
marshall
why
not?
justice
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
the
two?
justice
marshall
what
happens...
would
he
then
be
required
to
say
i
want
to
search
the
car
and
that
bag?
justice
marshall
why
not?
justice
marshall
well,
the
concept
is
it's
one
thing
to
search
the
car,
and
it's
one
thing
to
search
the
bag.
now
you
said
he
said
get
the
consent.
well,
if
he
gets
the
consent
to
search
the
car,
what
about
the
consent
to
search
the
bag?
justice
marshall
what
about
my
scenario?
justice
marshall
at
one
time
you
see
the
bag
was
right
there
by
the
seat,
and
now
you
say
the
bag
you
had
to
search
around
for.
justice
marshall
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
says
you
had
to
search
for
that
bag.
justice
marshall
right.
justice
marshall
well,
why
didn't
he
say
to
him
i
want
to
search
that
car
and
i
want
to
search
that
bag
in
particular?
justice
marshall
it
would
have
been
clearer.
justice
marshall
it
would
have
been
clearer?
justice
marshall
i
think
as
close
as
we're
going
to
get
is
clearer.
justice
marshall
but
on
the
facts...
i
can't...
maybe
i'm
mixing
it
up
with
another
case.
but
in
this
case
didn't
they
tell
him
that
if
he
didn't
consent
they
would
go
get
a
warrant?
