mr.
michael
j.
neimand
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
were
lawfully
stopped
in
miami,
florida
for
a
traffic
violation,
and
during
that
stop
they
were
advised
that
they
were
under
suspicion
for
transporting
illegal
narcotics
in
their
automobile.
thereafter
they
were
asked
for
consent
to
search
their
automobile
for
that
narcotics.
pursuant
to
that
request
the
consent
was
granted
and
the
officer
went
directly
into
the
passenger
compartment
and
went
to
the
brown
paper
bag,
which
was
a
grocery
bag,
unrolled
the
paper
bag
and
found
the
cocaine
in
question.
the
lower
court
found
these
facts.
the
lower
court
also
found
that
it
could
have
been
assumed
by
the
respondents
that
after
they
were
advised
that
they
were
looking
for
narcotics,
that
the
officer
would
have
gone
directly
to
the
bag
in
question.
the
court
found,
though,
that
it
was
bound
by
the
florida
supreme
court's
prior
decision
in
state
v.
wells
that
it
did
not
allow...
that
consent
did
not
allow
the
officer
to
open
a
container
within
the
passenger
compartment.
this
court
traveled
directly
through
the
lower
court,
found
again
the
same
findings
of
facts,
and
also
found
the
same
conclusion
of
law.
the
florida
supreme
court
without
argument
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
state
v.
wells.
this
court
then
accepted
certiorari
jurisdiction.
it
is
the
state's
contention
in
this
case
that
the
scope
of
the...
of
a
consent
is
based
upon
the
request
that
is
asked
and
the
knowledge
that
the
officer
gets
from
that.
therefore,
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
they
are
informed
that
they
are
looking
for
cocaine,
or
drugs,
as
the
case
may
be,
they
are
further
informed
that
they
do
not
have
to
consent
if
they
do
not
wish.
they
were
further
informed
that
if
they
did
consent
to
the
search
that
during
the
course
of
the
search
that
they
could
choose
at
any
time
to
terminate
that
search.
and
in
this
case
no
actions
were
ever
taken
by
the
respondents
to
terminate
that
search.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
if
that
is
a...
locked
with
a
key,
then
the,
it
probably
would
not
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
individual
consented
to
have
his
property
broken.
under
the
theory
of
this
court
of
consent,
the
consent
is
a
voluntary
nature
to
allow
the
citizenry
to
help
police
ferret
out
crime,
and
it
would
not
be
reasonable,
the
state
submits,
to
assume--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--only
because
the
individual
wells
was
not
present
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
only
on
its
facts.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
on
its
facts,
yes.
that's
why
we
did
not--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--correct.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
think
that
almost
goes
to
the
same
that
if
it
was
just
clasp
shut
and
you
have
a
attache
case
where
you
could
just--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
if
he
doesn't
destroy
the
property.
see,
that's
the
key,
the
destruction
of
the
property.
i
don't
think
any
reasonable
person
would
consent
to
have
his
property
destructed.
i
think
he
would
be--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
he
wouldn't
consent
to
have
the
lock
picked,
but
it
would
not
violate
the
reasonableness
because
he
had
no
property
destruction.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
the
scope
would
be
determined
by
what
he
was
asked
to
look
for.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
in
terms
of
a
reasonableness
approach,
that
would
probably
be
unlawful
as
to
the
scope
of
the
search
because
there
was
a
protection
interest
involved
and
there
would
be
somewhat
of
a
destruction
of
the
property.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
don't
think
there's
a
problem
there,
because
it
would
not
be
locked.
it
would
be
no
different
than
a
brown
paper
bag
in
this
situation.
you
would
just
open
up
the
handbag
and
look
in
the
handbag.
there
would
be
no
unreasonableness
involved
if
you
were
asking
to
search
for
a--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--again,
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
unreasonable
if
you're
looking
for
a
particular
item.
now,
drugs
probably
would
not
be
located
in
the
wallet.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
it
would
not
be
a
personal
search.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
would
say
that
under
the
law
that
in
order
to
touch
a
person
you
have
to
have
some
sort
of
reasonable
suspicion.
i
misunderstood
the
question.
if
the
wallet
were
lying
on
the
dashboard,
similar
to
a
purse
which
would
be
lying
on
the--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--seat
of
the
car,
then
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
the
state
has
not
abandoned
that.
that
is--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--i
think
you
would
have
to
ask...
because
you're
saying
may
i
look
into
your
car,
you're
not
saying
may
i
search
your
person.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
and
that's
the
difference.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
and
if
i
wanted
to
search
a
person
i
would
ask
to
consent
to
search
the
person.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
can
extend
to
that
based
on
the
factual
circumstances
of
a
particular
case.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
again,
what
i
would
say,
that
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
or
circumstances.
if
i
went
to
the
lock
and
i
tried
to
open
it,
and
i
went
with
a
lock
pick
and
the
defendant
or
respondent
will
consent
he
was
there
while
i
was
doing
that
and
there
was
no
termination
of
consent,
or
they
basically
assented
to
my
conduct,
then
that
would
be
a
further
consent
to--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--no,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
under
the
terms
here
it
was,
because
they
were
told--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--no.
they
were
told
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
you
may
at
any
time
during
our
search
terminate
the
search
on
any
item.
so
obviously
in
this
case,
on
these
facts,
that
would
have
worked
in
that
situation
as
well.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
though,
that
the
lower
courts
did
not
go
that
far.
they
said
that,
simply
that
once
you
get
the
consent
it
goes
to
the
entire...
only
the
compartment
and
no
containers
within
that
compartment.
and
they
applied
a
per
se
rule
in
that
instance
that
you
could
not
go
any
further
than
looking
into
the
car.
their
basic
approach
was
that
you
could
stick
your
head
in
and
look
around
for
the
narcotics,
even
though
they
were--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
there
might
have
been
more
narcotics
in
the
car.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
at
the
time
they
located
the
narcotics
in
the
car,
that
gave
them
probable
cause
to
see
if
there
was
narcotics--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--but
they
didn't.
in
this
case
they
exactly
went
to
the
paper
bag.
and
once
they
found
the
paper
bag,
that
was
it,
they
were
arrested.
they
did
no...
did
not
do
any
further
search.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
in
this
case,
because
of
the
facts,
the
respondents
were
under
suspicion
for
transporting
that,
those
drugs
in
that
paper
bag.
but
just
because
there
was
suspicion
that
that
bag
contained
drugs,
they
did
not
have
to
ask
specifically
to
search
that
drug,
because
he
search
itself,
the
consent
to
search
itself
was
valid
and
they
kept
within
the
scope
of
that
search.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
because
there
was
a
valid
consent.
consent
in
this
case
is
not
at
issue.
the
only
person
who--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--it
can.
a
general
consent
can.
it
depends
really
on
the
facts.
a
general
consent
may--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--the
facts
showed
that
this
officer
overheard
some
conversations
at
a
phone
booth--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--he
said
may
i
search...
we
believe
you
are
transporting
narcotics.
we
are
searching
for...
may
we
search
your
car
for
illegal
narcotics?
and
the
consent
was
yes,
you
may.
and
it
was
a
very
definite
request
and
a
very
definite
answer
of
yes.
there
was
no
hesitation.
he
was
further
told,
once
again,
that
he
did
not
have
to
consent,
and
if
he
did
consent
he
could
terminate
that
consent
at
any
time
if
he
did
not
want
anyone
to
go
into
any
part
of--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--this
is
the
fact
that
is
found
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
in
the
order
of
the
trial
court
in
the
special
hearing,
this--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--the
paper
bag,
i
believe,
was
in
the,
either
in
the
back
or
the
front
seat
on
the
floor.
just
rolled
up,
it
wasn't
sealed,
stapled
shut,
or
anything
in
that
nature.
it
was
a--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--yes.
i
did
read
acevedo.
it
was
another
brown
paper
bag.
so
that
it
was
lying
on
the
floor
in,
basically
in
plain
view.
they
did
not
have...
the
officer
did
not
have
to
go
through
any
tearing
of
any
seats,
going
under
any
seat--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--they
probably
could
have,
had
they
not
destroyed
the
bag.
if
it
was
not
that
strong
of
a
glue,
or
any
type
of
a
glue--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--there
should
be
no
problem
on
that.
it's
not
really
a
destruction
of
property.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
to
be
able
to
do
that,
because
it's
just
a
brown
paper
bag,
easily
purchased
at
any
grocery
store
with
any
kind
of
grocery
items.
it
comes
along
with
it.
it's
not
as
if
it's
a
suitcase--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--i
think
there
would
be
an
expectation,
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
police
would
not
rip
up
your
silk
purse.
you
spent
some
good
money
for
that.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
believe
so.
i
believe--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--it
would
help,
obviously.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
but
i
don't
think
they
have
to,
no.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
it
could
be.
then
again,
you
might
be
able
to
see
right
through
the
burlap
bag.
it
depends
on
how
it
has
been
handled.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
if
it's
shut
and...
i
believe
you
can.
i
believe
it
could
be
the
nature
of
the
item
that
we're
looking
at.
again,
we're
talking
about
destruction
of
personal
property,
and
you're
really
not
destroying
that
personal
property
because
it's
just
a
paper
bag
or
it's
just
a
burlap
bag
which
you
can
refold
over
and
close
up
and
go
on
your
way.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
but
you
consented
for
me
to
look
into
it.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
but
it's
not
a
total
destruction.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
but
it's
not
a
total
destruction.
it's
merely
an
opening
of
the
glue
or
the
staples
or
the
rope
that
is
tied
around
it.
we're
not
talking
about
total
destruction
of
the
property.
we're
talking
about
simply
being
able
to
open
that
property.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no.
we
would
not
attempt
to
destroy
the
property
whatsoever.
we
try
to
get
into
the
property
as
easily
as
possible
without
destroying
your
personal
property,
because
obviously
you're
not
going...
an
individual
is
not
going
to
consent
for
the
police
to
destroy
their
personal
property.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
in
this
case
no
pressure?
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no.
the
facts
do
not
show
that.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
there
is
many
reasons.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
there
are
many
reasons.
he
might
be
bluffing.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
he
might
be
bluffing,
he
might
feel
that--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--that's
right.
he
might
say
if
i'm
cooperating
they
might
not
go
that
far.
that's
right.
drug
dealers
are
not
very
smart,
because
if
they
were
they
wouldn't
be
getting
caught.
they
might
have
been
counseled
by
their
attorney
that
they
can't
go
that
far.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
there
are
many
reasons
why
an
individual
would
consent.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
wish
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
thank
you.
the
theory
that
my
opponent
is
stressing
today
has
already
been
rejected
by
this
court
in
horton
v.
california,
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
fact
that
an
officer
is
interested
in
an
item
of
evidence
and
fully
expects
to
find
it
in
the
course
of
a
search
should
not
invalidate
its
seizure
if
the
search
is
confined
in
area
and
duration
by
the
terms
of
a
warrant
or
valid
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
that's
horton
v.
california--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--your
honor,
and
that
came
out
just
recently.
and
that
is
exactly
what
they're
asking
you
to
recede
from
today,
saying
that
if
the
officer
knows
what
he's
looking
for
he
has
to
tell
the
individual
he
wants
to
search
from.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
correct.
we
say
that
we
have
the
same
ability
only
in
that
we
will
not
destroy
personal
property.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
not
as
complete
as
a
ross
case.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
because
we
will
not
destruct
the
personal
property,
because
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
assume
that.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
because
it's
the
same...
the
concept
is
the
same.
and
that
is
if
i
want
to--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--the
bag
is
now
part
of
the
car.
it's
the
same
concept
that
my
opponent
has
conceded,
that
if
the
consent
to
search
the
purse
or
the...
went
to
all
items
within
that
purse.
what
is
the
difference
between
the
car
and
the
items
contained
within
the
car,
and
the
items
contained
within
the
purse?
in
fact
under
the
scenario
that
my
opponent
is
taking
in
the
items
contained
within
the
purse,
he
is
saying
that
you
could
rifle
through
a
wallet
and
go
through
every
single
compartment,
and
it
indicates
you
might
even
be
able
to
break
or
destroy
property.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
it's
the
same.
you
have
the
ability,
because
the
bag
is
now
part
of
the
car.
it's...
you
open
the
door,
you
go
in
and
you
look
around
in
the
car,
and
this
was
not
just
a
may
i
look
around.
this
was
a
specific
request
to
search.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no.
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
i'm
not
saying
you
had
to
search
for
the
bag.
i'm
saying
the
bag
is
right
there.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
and
he
went
right
to
the
bag
and
he
opened
it.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
he
could
have,
but
under
this
court's
previous
holdings
he
did
not
have
to.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
it
would
have
been
clearer,
but
it
wouldn't
have...
it
wasn't
required
under
the
constitution.
and
therefore
he
did
not
have
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
obviously.
i
would
not
stand
here
and
say
it
wouldn't
have
been
clearer,
but
just
because
it
would
be
clearer,
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
has...
it's
authorized
or
required
under
the
constitution.
and
in
fact
under
this
court's
previous
case
that
i
cited,
horton,
that
is
not
required.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
that's
as
close
as
i
will
get,
your
honor.
[laughter]
the
interesting
point
here
is
what
was
told
the
defendant,
that
he
could
stop
the
search
at
any
time.
and
under
that
type
of
language
it's
clear
that
he
had...
he
knew
when
they
went
to
the
bag
that
he
could
have
stopped
it.
and
the
reason
we
do
not
have
any
cases
where
there
was
a
refused
consent,
because
if
there
is
a
refused
consent
the
police
will
normally
let
the
individual
go
on
his
way,
or
the
lower
court,
when
they
suppress
that
evidence,
it
remains
suppressed.
because
under
this
court's
holdings,
when
there
is
an
encounter
and
there
is
a
request
for
consent
and
there
is
no
probable
cause,
when
the
individual
says
no,
this
is
in
royer
and
in
mendenhall
and
that
line
of
cases,
then
the
police
must
leave
the
individual
alone
and
walk
away.
that's
why
we
don't
see
any
cases
where
there's
a
refused
consent
situation.
so--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--that
was
in
the
record.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
the
finding,
though,
was
that
the
consent
was
voluntary
and
that
was
never
challenged
below.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i'm...
there
is
no
answer
to
that
question,
because--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
but
unfortunately
we
do
not
know
because
they
never
testified,
and
so
we
don't
even
know
in
this
case.
but
yes,
that
was
in
the
record.
