mr.
abbe
david
lowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
using
the
current
savings
and
loan
crisis
as
its
cover,
the
united
states
mischaracterizes
the
fifth
circuit's
holding
and
the
factual
setting
of
this
case
to
raise
the
stakes
for
your
review.
as
to
the
facts,
the
court
is
being
asked
to
make
what
amounts
to
initial
findings
of
fact
from
extra-record
materials
not
relied
on
or
even
mentioned
by
the
district
court,
and
not
submitted
to
nor
even
used
by
the
court
of
appeals.
for
example,
that
independent
american
was
an
unhealthy
thrift
in
1985
and
1986
when
those
regulators
acted.
what
the
motives
of
the
regulators
were
when
they
took
action.
that
the
respondent
was
not
the
intended
beneficiary
of
the
regulator's
actions.
or
what
reports
were
available
to
the
regulators
in
1986.
this
is
not
the
appropriate
place
for
that
kind
of
fact
finding,
and
where
there
was
a
similar
need
for
record
development
in
berkovitz,
this
court
required
a
remand.
as
justice
kennedy
just
pointed
out,
these
are
very
fact-specific
decisions
that
have
to
be
made.
indeed,
of
the
joint
appendix
before
this
court,
15
of
the
21
pages
are
the
complaint
in
this
case.
and
that
indicates
all
the
lower
courts
had
before
them.
and
it
is
the
lower
courts
opinion,
based
on
these
facts,
that
is
on
review
before
this
court.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
justice
rehnquist,
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
pleadings,
excepting,
theoretically,
the
respondent's
allegations
as
being
true,
but
developing
such
a
broad
exception
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
no
balancing,
no
policy,
nothing
was
considered.
the
government's
argument
is
essentially
that
the
fifth
circuit
applied
some
mechanical
policy
versus
operational
test
to
decide
this
case.
however,
to
posture
it
that
way
the
united
states
mischaracterizes
the
fifth
circuit
as
stating
that
anything
labeled
as
operational
necessarily
falls
out
of
the
discretionary
function
exception.
challenge
the
government
when
it
rises
in
rebuttal
to
point
to
the
fifth
circuit
saying
that
anything
that
could
be
labelled
operation
necessarily
falls
out
of
the
function.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
followed--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--your
precedents
to
a
letter.
they
start
with--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--sorry.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
suggest
that
the
fifth
circuit
followed
your
precedents
to
the
letter.
what
they
did
was
start
with
the
phrase
operational,
as
used
in
indian
towing.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
only
because
the
government
conceded
it.
clearly
the--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--but
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
was
not...
look
at
the
appendix
to
the
government's
petition
for
cert.
at
7a.
if
the
government
were
correct
and
all
that
was
done
here
was
a
mechanical
application
of
indian
towing,
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
have
said,
as
it
precisely
says,
that
indian
towing
is
not
dispositive
of
this
case.
and
look
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
thereafter.
it
went
right
into
the
analysis
of
dalehite,
right
into
the
analysis
of
varig,
and
right
into
the
analysis
of
berkovitz.
what
better
could
they
do
to
pay
ligeance
to
your
precedents
than
doing
the
balancing
that
you
set
out?
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
no.
i
think
the--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--go
back
to
this
court's
holding
in
dalehite,
where
the
court
said
that
the
negligence
in
that
case
was
on
the
planning
rather
than
the
operational
level.
but
what's
interesting
is
that
many
courts
and
the
government
think
that
that's
all
the
supreme
court
said
in
that
case.
but,
you
know,
justice
reed's
opinion
went
on,
and
it
had
a
very
important
conjunctive.
justice
reed's
opinion
states
that
it
was
at
the
planning
rather
than
operational
level,
and,
and
it's
a
very
important
and,
involved
considerations
more
or
less
important
to
the
practicability
of
the
program.
you
start
with
a
decision
about
how
you
characterize
it,
as
planning
or
operation,
but
that's
not
enough.
you
go
on
to
see
how
it
fits
into
the
regulatory
scheme.
that's
exactly
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
in
this
case.
it
calls
it
operational
on
the
first
part,
but
then
it
does
that
same
kind
of
balancing
as
justice
reed
suggested
in
dalehite
to
get
to
the
determination
of
how
important
that
decision
was
to,
in
the
words
of
dalehite,
the
program
or
the
practicability
of
the
program.
under
the
proper
analysis
that
this
court
has
set
out--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--i
think
it
is
an
aid,
and
only
an
aid,
to
look
back
at
some
antecedent
policy
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
act,
as
later
this
court
determined
in
berkovitz
or
in
dalehite,
is
the
kind
of
act
that
is
so
governed
by
regulation...
for
example,
in
dalehite.
i
mean,
down
to
the
level
of
what
bags
to
be
used
in
fertilizer,
what
coating
to
be
used,
how
the
temperature
should
be,
were
all
governed
by
regulation.
i
think
when
you
use
a
handy
phrase
as
planning
or
operational
or
policy,
it
just
means
that
it's
a
way
to
characterize
the
activity.
but
it's
not
all
it
does--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it's--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--i
think
it
just
helps
in
determining
the
scrutiny
a
court
gives.
i
mean,
i
think
there's
an
extra
warning,
if
you
will,
for
decisions
that
courts
concede
are
on
the
planning
level.
i
think
therefore...
i
guess
the
government
has
a
better
presumption,
if
you
will,
that
it
affects
some
kind
of
regulatory
policy
than
when
it
can
be
characterized...
and
many
words
have
been
used
by
the
courts:
operational,
proprietary,
and
ministerial.
i
think
it's
just
a
kind
of
a
careful
way
that
you
can
determine
what
kind
of
presumption.
the
government
would
stretch
that
to
be
a
total
presumption.
i
think
it's
just
a
handy
phrase.
i
think
what's
important,
though,
and
what
the
government
mischaracterizes,
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
simply
do
this
mechanical
operation
versus
policy.
if
that
was
the
case,
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
could
have
been
as
short
as
the
district
court
and
be
three
pages
long.
instead
it
went
on
to
the
kind
of
balancing
that
you
talked
about...
the
court
talked
about
just
2
years
ago.
under
that
proper
analysis,
justice
scalia,
what
happened
was
that
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at
two
things.
they
looked
at
varig's
quotation
of
the
nature
of
the
conduct,
not
the
level,
to
determine
that
only
10
of
the
31
initial
paragraphs
in
the
amended
complaint
could
survive.
interestingly,
all
those
occurred
at
the
same
operational
level.
they
then
looked
at
berkovitz
to
see
if
there
was
any
choice
involved,
and
then,
if
there
was
a
choice
involved,
whether
it
was
the
kind
congress
intended
to
protect,
in
sifting
through
the
normal
regulatory
acts,
of
whether
to
merge
independent
american,
what
kind
of
people
to
send
into
independent
american,
versus
the
extraordinary
acts
of
setting
salaries,
picking
consultants,
handing
collateral,
dealing
with
loans.
as
much
as
they
may
try
to
disguise
it,
the
petitioner--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--no,
not
necessarily
at
all.
i
think
the
fact
that
they
are
extraordinary
here
points
out...
it's
not
so
much,
you
know,
again--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--i
think
it's...
it's
not
outcome
determinative.
it's
not
that
because
it's--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--i
think
when
you
can
label
something...
because
it
points
out
that
there
was
no
antecedent
policy.
the
fact
that
it's
extraordinary
gives
you
warning
and
gives
you
insight
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
policy
that
governed,
dictated,
or
in
any
way
blessed
the
acts
that
were
taken
below.
when
it--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--i
think
the
fact
that
it's
extraordinary
means
that
there
is
no
policy
that
is
implicated--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--i
think,
in
the
way
you've
asked
it,
the
fact
that
it's
extraordinary
militates
against
the--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--application
of
the
discretionary
function
exemption.
that's
not...
it's
not
impossible
to
hypothesize
some
facts
that
have
never
been
done
by
a
regulatory
agency,
but
would
still
be
somehow
caught
up
in
a
policy
or
dictated.
for
example,
i
guess
in
dalehite,
i
think
it
was
rather
extraordinary
in
dalehite
that
there
was
all
these
activities...
bagging,
coating,
fertilizer
at
certain
temperatures.
up
until
that
point,
that
was
fairly
extraordinary.
however,
there
were
very
precise
regulations
antecedent
to
those
actions
that
protected
it
under
the
discretionary
function
exemption.
here
there
are
no
such
regulations
of
any
kind.
i
think
as
much
as
they
may
try
to
disguise
it,
petitioner
is
seeking
immunity
for
any
act
taken
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
and
by
extension,
to
other
regulatory
agencies,
as
long
as
some
choice
had
to
be
made,
without
an
inquiry
into
what
kind
of
choice
or
why
the
choice
was
made.
that
is,
whether
the
choice
was
part
of
or
not
part
of
a
real
regulatory
scheme.
in
the
district
court
the
government
asked
for
and
got
this
very
broad
exception
which
encompasses
the
rule
so
that
any
act
taken
"in
extension
of
the
discretionary
function.
"
is
itself
discretionary
and
protected.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
with
victory
in
its
hands,
the
government
asked
and
said
there
is
simply
no
such
thing
in
a
thrift
regulatory
context
as
a
decision
to
regulate
on
one
hand
and
a
decision
to
take
over
the
management
on
the
other.
and
just
in
oral
argument,
mr.
gerson
stated
that
now
what
they
were
doing
was
looking
for
any
act
protection
which
was,
quote,
"consistent
with
regulatory
scheme"
or,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
point,
quote,
"part
of
the
judgmental
process
of
enforcement.
"
this
is
just
the
next
in
a
line
of
cases
in
which
the
united
states
is
asking
this
court
for
a
broader
exemption
from
liability
than
congress
ever
intended,
or,
as
the
court
has
stated
repeatedly,
when
it
says
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
a
broad
waiver
of
immunity.
in
varig
they
asked
for
an
exception
for
what
they
then
called
core
governmental
activities.
in
rayonier
they
asked
for
what
they
then
wanted,
which
was
uniquely
governmental
capacity.
in
indian
towing
they
asked
for
what
was
then
called
uniquely
governmental
function.
in
berkovitz
they
asked
for
an
exemption
in
the
same
words
they
use
on
page
2
of
their
brief
before
this
court,
for
acts
"arising
out
of
regulatory
programs".
and
just
6
minutes
or
10
minutes
ago,
the
government
asked
for
acts
which
"are
derived
from
uniquely
federal
interests.
"
in
each
of
these
cases
the
court
has
rejected
the
government's
attempt
for
such
broad
exemption
in
words
almost
remarkably
similar
to
that
mr.
gerson
stated
just
a
few
minutes
ago.
in
the
district
court
the
government
got
its
broad
rule,
that
is,
it
got
protection
for
any
act
which
is
an
extension
of
a
discretionary
function.
and
so
the
district
court
did
not
carefully
analyze
the
conduct
alleged
or
allow
any
discovery
to
develop
the
kind
of
record
this
court
had
before
it
in
dalehite,
in
varig,
in
indian
towing,
in
rayonier,
and
the
kind
of
record
the
court
stated
it
needed
to
deal
with
the
second
part
of
its
recent
berkovitz
decision.
the
united
states
seems
to
acknowledge
this
scanty
record
by
feeling
compelled
to
add
so
many
facts
of
their
own
from
so-called
background
materials,
which
dispute
the
facts
as
they
are
alleged
to
be.
for
determining
the
issues
in
this
case
as
required
by
looking
at
conduct,
as
spoken
to
in
varig,
and
the
method
and
manner
of
the
choices
made,
as
spoken
in
berkovitz,
there
are
only
a
handful
of
facts
that
are
necessary.
first,
respondent
left
his
thrift,
independent
american,
in
1984,
for
reasons
having
nothing
to
do
with
independent
american.
second,
at
the
time
independent
american
was
a
healthy
thrift
with
a
positive
net
worth.
third,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
through
individuals
on
the
scene,
took
over
the
day-to-day
management
of
that
thrift,
including
picking
employees,
setting
salaries,
resolving--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--with
the
consent,
justice
rehnquist...
mr.
chief
justice.
the
issue
of
whether
there's
consent--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--is
not
dispositive
of
whether
or
not
the
discretionary
function
exemption
applies.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
yes.
i
like
that
the
government
even
recently
in
oral
argument
characterizes
this
as
giving,
quote,
"managerial
guidance".
as
the
court
of
appeals
rightly
noted,
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
regulators
on
the
scene
came
the
actions
of
the
people
in
the
thrift.
this
wasn't
advice;
this
was
direction.
this
was
actually
doing.
they
may
try
to
characterize
this
as
advice,
but--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--i
don't
think
that
there
was
a
predicate.
well,
there
was
no
predicate
that
would
traditionally
be
in
place,
for
example,
a
conservatorship
or
receivership,
cease
and
desist
order,
no
supervisory
agreement
of
any
kind.
so
if
you
say
to
me
were
they
exerting
some
legal
authority,
they
weren't
predicating
their
acts
on
any
piece
of
paper
or
decision
by
the
bank
board
to
justify
their
intrusion
into
this
thrift.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
oh,
yes,
they
took
many
acts
in
the
names
of
the
savings
and
loan.
they
hired
a
new
consulting
firm.
they
set
the
salary
of
the
chief
operating
officer,
who
used
to
be
an
employee
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
of
dallas.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
they...
not
only
did
they
set
the
salary,
the
man
who
got
the
money
was
the
man
who
set
the
salary.
your...
this
is
one
of
the
problems
with
a
record
that
is
in
the
state
that
it's
in
right
now,
which
is
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
when
you
have
notice
pleading.
if
we
were
developing
the
record
you
would
find
many
of
these
acts
were
not
even
remotely
taken
in
the
name
of
any
regulatory
agency.
they
were
all
taken
in
the
name
of
independent
american.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
i
mean
that
this
man,
who
was
an
employee
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
of
dallas
and
was
moved
from
the
federal
home
loan
bank
of
dallas
into
independent
american,
set
his
own
salary,
and
did
so
in
this
mode
of--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--he
went
to
the
place
where--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--checks
are
written
in
independent
american,
and
he
said
write
me
$108,000
check
as
a
signing
bonus.
that's
about
as
close
to
setting
your
salary
as
you
could
possibly
get
in
a
factual
context.
and
that's
what
he
did.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
some
person
in
the
bursar's--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--that
person
could
have
said
no.
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
any
of
the
discretionary
function
cases
will
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
acts
of
the
government
are
taken
kicking
and
screaming
or
taken
by
the
fact
that
the
people
go
along.
it
is
the
actions
themselves
that--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--i
mean
that
he...
i
don't
mean
that
in
the
dead
of
night
he
came
and
wrote
himself
a
check.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
correct.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
that's
exactly
what
happened.
in
addition
to
these
various
acts
which
cannot
be
deemed
just--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--he
was
put
into
independent
american
as
the
chief
operating
officer.
he
had
the
power
to
hire
and
fire
everybody
else
in
the
thrift.
and
not
only
was
he
the
chief
operating--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--this
is
not
alleged
in
the
complaint.
this
is
the
problem
i
have
with
answering
questions
that
are
factually
based,
as
justice
scalia
did,
from
what
i
know
to
be
the
facts,
rather
than
the
state
of
the
record
which--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--i
think
that
the
paragraphs
of
the
complaint
to
set
out
the
appendix
say
that
they
actually
set
the
salaries.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
on
15.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
that
reference
covers
the
fact
that
we
are
talking
about,
justice
kennedy.
again,
one
of
the
issues
that
i
have
to
address
with
the
court
is
the
fact
that
in
the
complaint,
which
was
written
3-1/2
years
ago
at
a
time
that
the
government
had
all
the
documents
in
this
case
and
the
government
had
all
the
witnesses
in
this
case,
the
notice
pleading
required
gave
adequate
notice
to
the
government
that
this
wasn't
a
failure
to
warn
case.
this
wasn't
a
varig
case
where
you
were
concerned
about
whether
or
not
to
assert
regulatory
authority.
i
think
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
had
any
problem
discussing
these
facts
and
determining,
especially
in
the
court
of
appeals
level,
which
of
the
31
paragraphs
went
to
things
which
could
be
called
discretionary,
and
which
are
the
ones
that
deal
with
a
kind
of
involvement
that
go
beyond
the
discretionary
function
exemption.
in
light
of
all
these
active,
not
just
advice,
activities
taken
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
the
fourth
important
fact
was
that
there
was
no
supervisory
agreement
in
place
and
no
regulation,
or
no
guideline
dictating
any
of
the
conduct
that
we
challenge.
and
the
last
important
fact--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--in
the
way
you
asked
me
the
question--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--yes,
it
would
be,
because
you
started
your
question
by
saying
let's
say
they
had
a
policy
of
setting--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--the
government,
the
salary
with
the
prevailing
rate.
the
interesting
thing
in
this
case
is
that
the
government
in
all
the
litigation
thus
far,
even
in
the
facts
which
they
put
into
footnotes
in
the
briefs
before
this
court,
can't
point
to
a
single
policy
antecedent
to
the
acts
of--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--that's
right,
justice
stevens.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
the
last
fact
was
that
these
actions
taken
when
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
was
making
decisions
caused
independent
american
to
lose
what
they
estimate
at
some
$400
million
when
the
respondent
left
his
thrift
in
a
positive
net
worth
situation.
in
addition
to
adding
facts--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--that
is--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--your
question
would
assume
that
these
people
at
the
time
actually...
it
depends
on
whether
policy
is
the
result
of
any
action
taken
by
a
regulator
or
the
motive
of
the
regulator.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
anything
a
regulator
does
ergo
makes
policy,
then
you
are
right.
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
everything
is
policy,
therefore
you
don't
need
a
policy
qualification
to
the
discretionary
function
exemption.
but
your
hypothetical
strikes
me
as
at
least
indicating
that
there
was
some
balancing
involved
before
the
act
was
committed.
policy
is
not
the
result
of
a
regulator's
action.
it
should
be
the
reason
for
a
regulator's
action.
and
in
this
case
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was,
and
we
allege
that
there
was
not.
in
addition
to
adding
facts,
the
united
states
urges
this
court
to
look
at
its
case
in
context,
first
in
context
of
the
savings
and
loan
crisis,
and
then
in
context
of
its
entire
regulatory
framework.
well,
the
real
context
are
the
facts
of
this
solvent
thrift
in
1984
and
1985,
not
what
the
government
wants
to
allege
the
crisis
to
be
in
1990,
and
the
entire
regulatory
framework
is
an
issue
before
this
court
only
as
the
united
states
wants
to
raise
the
stakes
to
have
it
so.
in
addition
to
mischaracterizing
the
fifth
circuit,
the
united
states
asserts
the
wrong
supreme
court
precedents.
this
case
arises
in
a
torts
setting
similar
to
that
suggested
by
this
court
in
its
recent
berkovitz
decision,
that
is
a
case
where
federal
officials
act
without
there
being
regulations
governing
their
action.
it
is
not
governed
by
varig,
despite
the
united
states'
attempt
to
make
it
so.
it
is
true
that
neither
the
faa
in
varig,
nor
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
here,
had
extensive
regulations.
but
that
is
where
the
similarity
ends.
varig
dealt
with
the
regulation
of
third
parties,
and
here
it
is
their
own
conduct
in
dispute.
that
contrasts
the
traditional
regulatory
law
enforcement
role
of
agencies
versus
what
some
courts
have
called
proprietary
or
ministerial.
the
challenge
in
varig
was
in
effect
to
the
decision
about
the
degree
of
supervision,
whether
to
include
all
planes,
some
planes,
whether
to
do
spot
checks
or
not.
the
united
states
tries
to
make
this
case
such
a
similar
challenge
by
raising
what
is
in
effect
a
red
herring
that
what
we
are
challenging
is
the
decision
to
do
informally
that
which
they
could
do
formally.
first,
we
are
not
challenging
that
decision.
it
makes
no
difference
to
our
analysis
of
the
law
whether
or
not
they
took
these
actions
in
the
most
formal
setting
or
not.
second
of
all,
the
suasion
that
they
talk
about
occurred
after
the
takeover.
there
was
no
individual
balancing
for
each
of
the
acts
that
we
alleged
to
have
been
done
negligently.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
yes,
it
does.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
no.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
i
think
that
their
decision
of
who
to
put
into
the
thrift
would
be
protected
as
a
discretionary
function...
as
the
fifth
circuit,
by
the
way,
held
that
we
had
no
cause
of
action
left
as
to
who
was
sent
to
independent
american.
but
if
you
then
say
that
this
conservator,
on
the
scene,
decides
not
to
collect
on
loans
and
destroys
collateral,
and
then
hires
employees
in
a
poor
way,
and
then
doesn't
take
the
day-to-day
functionary
activities,
i
think
the
people
left
at
the
thrift
after
the
conservator
was
done
would
have
a
cause
of
action
if--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--against
the
united
states,
whoever
put
in
the
conservator.
if,
but
only
if,
the
conservator's
actions
on
not
collection
on
the
loans,
setting
the
salaries,
taking
those
kind
of
management
decisions,
did
not
have
an
antecedent
policy
that
either
disctated
or
blessed
what
he
or
she
did
on
the
scene.
it
is
simply
not
the
act,
but
you
must
go
back
and
determine
what
the
reason
or
what
the
nature
of
the
choice
was.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
no,
not
what
kind
of
a
conservator
to
appoint.
i
think
that
that
decision,
as
you
pose
it,
that
question
as
you
pose
it
to
me
would
be
immune.
i
think
if
they
decide
that
john
doe
ought
to
be
their,
as
opposed
to
sally
roe,
i
think
that
decision,
as
the
fifth
circuit
rightly
held,
would
be
immune
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
i
think--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--they
did
not
appoint
a
conservator,
number
one--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--if
the
conservator
is
an
employee,
official
of
the
united
states,
acting
under
the
authority
of
the
regulations.
now,
i
don't
know
in
our
hypothetical
whether
the
conservator
plays
that
role,
but
i
am
assuming
that
he
does,
or
she
does,
then
the
answer
is
yes.
their
duty
would
be,
because
they
were
still
in
the
clothing
of
the
united
states.
the
cases,
and
there
are
very
few
of
them
that
have
raised
this,
all
say
unanimously
that
such
a
fact
hypothetical
that
you
and
i
are
positing
raises
liability.
that's
the
emch
case
of
the
seventh
circuit,
the
carter
case
of
the
district
of
california,
the
hartford
decision
in
franklin
national
bank.
now,
they
all
say
that
under
certain
circumstances...
few
of
which
were
found
in
the
facts
of
those
cases,
by
the
way,
after
discovery,
after
they
had
a
chance
to
prove
their
case...
rose
to
the
level
of
being
actionable,
but
all
of
them
say
that
the
fdic
or
the
fslic
can
be
held
liable
for
those
kinds
of
negligent
acts
on
the
scene.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
i
mean
antecedent,
not
counting
out
the
possibility
that
you
stated,
that
policy
is
made
at
that
time.
it
doesn't
have...
i
am
not
saying
that
you
cannot--
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
--no,
it
has
to
be
antecedent
either
already
existing,
or
the
act
has
to
take
place
on
the
basis
of
some
policy-oriented
decision
being
made
right
then
and
there.
but
it
can't
be
after
the
fact
they
go
back
and
say
by
the
way,
everything
a
regulator
does
is
policy.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
this
court
has
stated
that
in
order
to
be
protected
there
has
to
be
economic,
social,
or
political
policy
considerations.
now,
i
think
that
means
that
either
they
have
to
preexist
the
decision,
or
the
decision
has
to
be
seen
as
being
made
pursuant
to
them.
but
if
what
that
means
is
that
after
the
fact
the
government
can
say
that
it
was
policy
by
result,
i
don't
think
you
have
an
exception.
i
think
that
therefore
all
you
need
to
decide
is
was
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
wearing
its
federal
home
loan
bank
board
jacket,
did
they
go
in
that
day,
and
did
they
take
action.
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
precedents
of
this
court
mean
is
the
way
that
you
apply
the
discretionary
function
exemption.
at
least
that's
not
what
they
have
said,
and
you
have
said
as
recently
as
2
years
ago
in
berkovitz.
one
thread
throughout
all
the
cases,
no
matter
if
they
are
expressed
as
policy
or
discretion
or
planning,
has
been
that
actions
are
protected
if
their
challenge
threatens
or
jeopardizes
the
feasibility
or
practicability
of
the
program.
so
stated
in
dalehite,
when
it
said
that
it
must
be
on
the
planning
level
and
be
important
to
the
practicability.
so
stated
in
varig
when
they
said
that
decisions
are
covered
only
if
they
directly
affect
the
feasibility
and
practicability
of
the
government
regulatory
program.
the
fifth
circuit
distinguished
carefully
between
those
acts
that
could
affect
the
program:
the
merger
of
independent
american,
which
kind
of
person
to
put
into
independent
american,
versus
those
that
could
not:
mediating
actual
salaries,
hiring
their
own
contacts
as
consultants,
deciding
which
litigation
to
bring,
and
disposing
of
collateral
through
putting
it
into
bankruptcy.
those
acts
that
are
left
hardly
threaten
the
feasibility
of
any
program
or
existing
policy.
indeed
the
only
policy
pointed
to
in
the
government's
brief
runs
directly
contrary,
pointing
to
informal
suasion
as
being
appropriate
only
in
cases
of
small
problems,
not
cases,
as
they
allege
independent
american
to
be,
in
desperate
need
of
regulatory
oversight.
there
is
no
policy
threatened
here
except
if
the
united
states
is
able
to
persuade
the
court
that
immunity
is
co-terminus
with
any
regulatory
choice
that
they
make,
so
that
any
choice
they
make,
as
second-guessed
by
any
court,
goes
to
their
regulatory
authority.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
they
say
that
it
does
state
a
cause
of
action
for
a
tort
and
leaves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
gaubert,
the
respondent,
has
standing
to
bring
them
under
texas
law.
but
that
standing
question,
as
the
discretionary
function,
is
very
fact
laden,
and
i
suspect
it
would
depend
on
what
texas
law
holds
on
those
issues.
but
they
do
say
it
goes
back
for
that
purpose.
mr.
abbe
david
lowell
there
can
be
no
policy
threatened
here
unless
the
court
accepts
the
government's
proposition
that
anything
taken
in
a
government
context
by
a
regulatory
agency
is
policy
laden.
when
the
facts
or
law
are
weak,
the
united
states
again
raises
the
specter
of
the
flood
gates
of
litigation
or
stopping
the
governments
in
its
tracks.
so
is
the
message
of
amicus
in
this
case.
they
did
so
in
varig,
they
did
so
in
rayonier,
they
did
so
in
muniz,
and
they
do
so
again
here.
while
they
point
to
many
cases
in
the
justice
department,
they
have
only
been
able
to
point
to
one
in
the
courts,
notwithstanding
that
there
is
a
year
and
a
half
since
this
decision
has
been
made,
and
that
one
is
an
independent
american
case
just
brought
by
a
different
plaintiff.
the
united
states
wants
this
court
to
consider
the
context,
but
we
would
submit
that
the
immunity
they
seek
takes
one
important
player,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
out
of
the
context
of
the
checks
and
balances
that
now
exists.
directors
and
officers
are
liable
civilly
for
their
actions.
congressmen
can
be
voted
out
of
office
or
disciplined
for
their
actions
in
the
savings
and
loan
crisis.
only
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
would
be
taken
out
of
the
loop
if
the
government
gets
the
extent
of
immunity
they
want.
mr.
gaubert
is
stuck
in
the
middle
of
a
struggle
between
congress,
the
court,
and
the
executive,
where
the
executive
keeps
seeking
a
broader
immunity,
says
it
doesn't
want
absolute
immunity,
but
only
posits
an
automobile
accident
again
and
again
as
the
only
kind
of
act
which
arises
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
they
seek
a
rule
not
so
much
that
the
king
can
do
no
wrong,
but
that
the
king
can
do
wrong
only
when
he
is
driving
his
royal
carriage.
one
issue
before
the
lower
courts
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
or
not
the
regulatory
takeover
of
day-to-day
management
of
a
healthy
thrift
can
ever
be
actionable.
not
that
it
is
actionable,
but
what
it
can
be.
if
the
government
finds
in
the
record
that
is
developed
below
that
they
have
grounds
to
show
discretionary
function,
they
can
move
again
for
summary
judgment,
the
correct
vehicle
for
testing
these
very
fact-laden
decisions.
therefore,
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
our
briefs,
and
in
its
decision,
the
court
should
affirm
the
fifth
circuit's
case
and
decision,
give
respondent
his
day
in
court
to
prove,
as
those
in
dalehite
and
varig
and
indian
towing
and
in
berkovitz
were
able
to
prove,
that
the
government
has
done
him
wrong,
and
that
he
has
an
apt
remedy.
