chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1793,
united
states
v.
thomas
gaubert.
mr.
gerson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gerson,
you
say
there
are
two
questions
presented.
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
you
only
have
one
question.
are
the
two
questions
you
stated
both
comprised
within
that
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
case
authority
for
this
two-part
test?
chief
justice
rehnquist
berkovitz?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gerson.
mr.
lowell,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
dispose
of
this
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
mr.
lowell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
lowell,
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
did
rely
on
some
sort
of
distinction
which
i
don't
find
in
our
cases
between
operational
on
the
one
hand
as
the
counterpart
of
discretionary.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
the
chief
justice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
the
chief
justice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
which,
which
was
not
a
discretionary
function
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lowell,
the
court
said
in
indian
function,
we're
not
dealing
with
discretionary
function
because
the
government
didn't
make
that
argument.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
if...
your
answer
to
the
question
where
does
the
word
operational
come
from
in
our
discretionary
function
cases,
you
say
it
comes
from
indian
towing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
does...
what
case
does
the
word
operational
come
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lowell,
does
the
fact
that
the
things
the
government
did
in
a
particular
case
were
extraordinary,
does
that
bear
on
operational
versus
policy?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but...
you
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
does
the
fifth
circuit
mention
it,
then,
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
the
fact
that
it
was
extraordinary,
you
think
that
militates
against
the
exercise
of
the
discretionary
exemption
or
for
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
answer
my
question?
i
asked
you
do
you
think,
does
the
presence
of
something
that's
extraordinary
militate
in
favor
of
the
discretionary
exemption
or
against
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
against
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
took
over,
mr.
lowell,
do
you
mean
against,
without
the
consent
of
the
respondent
or
with
the
consent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lowell,
does
the
board
have
authority
in
some
circumstances
to
appoint
a
conservator?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
it
had
gone
ahead
and
appointed
a
conservator.
would
you
have
any
action
against
the
board
if
you
found
that
the
conservator,
that
they
appointed
someone
who
was
just
a
lousy
conservator,
and
by
doing
some
research
they
could
have
gotten
a
much
better
conservator?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
against
the
conservator
or
against
the
government?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
then
the
question
that
would
be,
what
was
the
government's
policy
with
respect
to
what
kind
of
a
conservator
to
appoint?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
what
is
the...
what
is
the
genesis,
the
nature
of
the
claim
against
the
government
in
this
case,
in
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
mean
in
the
hypothetical
case.
you
say
there
would
be
a
claim
against
the
government.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lowell.
mr.
gerson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gerson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinion
of
the
court

no.
