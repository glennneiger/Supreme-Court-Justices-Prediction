justice
stevens
does
that
answer
the
loan
example?
that's
what
i
don't
follow.
justice
stevens
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
but
just
to
focus
on
justice
scalia's
hypothetical.
a
particular
judgment
on
whether
to
approve
a
particular
loan
or
not,
without
the
federal
regulators,
they
want
to
be
sure
they
had
good
collateral
and
that
the
loan
would
be
paid
off.
would
those
same
factors
bring
it
within
the
discretionary
function
if
a
federal
official
made
the
decision?
justice
stevens
you
say
it
might,
but
what
other
facts
do
you
need?
justice
stevens
no,
they
decide
what
the
standards
are
for
all
the
loans,
and
then
they're
applying
those
standards
in
a
particular
application,
to
a
particular
loan
application.
and
they
can
either
approve
it
or
not,
depending
on
whether
they
think
the
collateral
is
good.
is
that
covered
by
the
discretionary--
justice
stevens
--well,
here
you
have
an
allegation
that
the
defendants
arranged
for
the
hiring
of
a
particular
consultant
on
operational
and
financial
matters.
and
supposing
you
had
two
qualified...
consultants
and
they
chose...
i
mean
two
that
met
the
same
standards,
but
they
chose
one
rather
than
the
other
because
they
didn't
really
check
their
background
and
find
out
they
were
a
bunch
of
thieves,
or
something.
is
that
covered?
justice
stevens
well,
you're
saying,
for
example,
that
the
federal
policy
to
have
the
institution
not
make
any
bad
loans
would
be
enough
to
justify
discretion
on
selecting
which
loans
are
acceptable
and
which
are
not.
justice
stevens
and
if
there's
a
federal
policy
to
favor
good
management,
then
hiring
the
consultant,
of
course,
you
get
discretion
on
which
managers
to
pick.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
that
would
be...
i
think
that's
your
position.
the
federal
policy
is
to
run
the
company
efficiently
and
effectively,
and
so
anything
that
relates
to
choices
on
the
effectiveness
or
efficiency
of
the
business
would
be
implementing
federal
policy.
justice
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
your
salary
example
for
a
minute?
supposing
the
government
agency
had
a
policy
that
whenever
they
got
in
this
position
with
a
financial
institution,
that
they
would
set
the
management
salary
at
the
prevailing
level
in
the
business
community
right
there,
and
this
is
exactly
what
they
did.
would
that
be
covered
by
the
discretionary--
justice
stevens
--yeah.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
so
we
should
read
your
complaint
as
saying
that
they
did
these
things
without
any
policy
preceding
the
specific
acts
that
would
have
called
for
these
things
being
done?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
mr.
lowell,
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
maybe
it's
too
elementary,
but
the...
did
the
fifth
circuit
hold
that,
as
a
matter
of
texas
law,
the
portions
of
the
complaint
that
are,
do,
that
are
not
within
the
discretionary
function
exemption
actually
state
a
cause
of
action
for
a
tort?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
