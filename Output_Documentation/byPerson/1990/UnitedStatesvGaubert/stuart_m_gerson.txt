mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
given
the
regulators
of
the
nation's
financial
institutions
an
extremely
broad
range
of
discretionary
authority
to
achieve
the
specific
policy
ends
of
safeguarding
the
accounts
of
depositors
and
protecting
the
taxpayer-funded
system
of
depository
insurance.
this
is
precisely
the
sort
of
discretion
that
congress
chose
to
protect
against
attack
when,
as
a
safeguard
to
the
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
embodied
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
it
added
the
discretionary
function
exception
of
28
u.s.c.
section
2680.
there
are
two
questions
here.
first,
whether
the
fifth
circuit
erred
in
applying
an
operational
distinction
to
exclude
coverage
of
the
exception
to
the
discretionary
acts
of
supervisory
regulators
under
the
aegis
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
who,
consistent
with
their
regulatory
charge,
provided
managerial
guidance
to
the
leadership
of
the
independent
american
savings
association,
a
federally
insured,
state-chartered
thrift
in
which
respondent
was
an
investor.
assuming
the
fifth
circuit
did
so
err,
the
second
question
for
this
court
is
whether
the
policy
relationship
of
the
challenged
regulatory
act
is
so
clear
as
to
allow
this
court
to
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
discretionary
function
exception
applies
to
them.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
yes,
they
are,
mr.
chief
justice.
although
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
discretionary
function
exception
covered
the
board's
decision
to
merge
iasa
with
another
company,
obtain
a
so-called
neutralization
agreement
from
the
respondent,
and
replace
the
iasa
board
of
directors,
it
held
that
the
board's
agents
lost
the
protection
of
section
2680
when
they
began
to
advise
management
and
participate
in
management
decisions;
when
they
hired
a
consultant
regarding
finance
and
asset
management
to
advise
them
and
the
board
members;
when
they
directed
iasa
to
convert
to
a
federal
charter,
so
that
it
would
become
the
only
governmental
entity
with
power
to
control
iasa;
when
they
supervised
the
filing
of
litigation
on
behalf
of
iasa
and
consulted
with
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
in
washington
about
it;
and
when
they
advised
and
recommended
which
of
the
institution
subsidiaries
should
be
placed
in
bankruptcy
and
how,
if
at
all,
that
should
be
done;
and
lastly
when
they
intervened
with
state
authorities
who
had
attempted
to
install
their
own
supervisory
agent.
seizing
upon
a
footnote
in
this
court's
opinion
in
berkovitz
against
united
states
adverting
to
the
earlier
indian
towing
decision,
which
was
not
a
discretionary
function
case,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
board's
officials
"were
only
protected
by
the
discretionary
function
exception
until
their
actions
became
operational.
"
inasmuch
as
the
court
recognized
that
the
board
officials
were
acting
within
their
authority,
saying
that
that
was
unchallenged,
and
also
recognized
that
since
there
were
no
regulations
guiding
them
at
every
turn,
their
acts
were
discretionary.
and
hence
the
operational
criterion
imposed
by
the
court,
we
suggest,
represented
an
erroneous
understanding
of
both
this
court's
decisions
in
berkovitz
and
indian
towing.
the
discretionary
function
exception,
which
is
categorical
and
makes
no
distinction
as
to
operational
activities,
has
meaning
and
antecedents
which
go
back
at
least
as
far
in
this
court
as
marbury
against
madison
in
1803.
the
congress
had
that
in
mind
when
it
crafted
the
discretionary
function
exception
as
a
safeguard,
it
not
appearing
in
earlier
versions
considered
in
several
congresses.
but
of
course
this
court
recognized
that
every
act
has
some
element
of
choice
in
it.
and
hence,
culminating
with
berkovitz,
this
court
has
adopted
a
two-part
test
for
evaluating
whether
or
not
the
discretionary
function
exception
should
be
given
application.
the
first
of
those
aspects
of
that
two-part
test
is
the
question
was
there
a
discretionary
act?
absent
that,
the
court
has
not
recognized
any
uniquely
governmental
function--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--berkovitz,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
think
that
that
bifurcation
is
set
forth
clearly.
i
think
also
that
the
first
tine
is
rather
easily
met,
that
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
actions
were
discretionary
but
held
applying
this
operational
distinction
as
a
starting
point,
which
was
kind
of
an
ending
point
in
indian
towing,
that
the
second,
or
didn't
get
to
the
second
test,
which
is
was
the
discretion
based
upon
policy
considerations.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
engage
in
this
inquiry
at
all.
that,
under
dalehite,
varig,
and
berkovitz,
we
suggest,
alone
requires
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
we
believe
that
all
of
the
acts
that
i
described
earlier
were
indeed
based
upon
policy
considerations
for
two
reasons.
first,
each
of
them
was
part
of
the
judgmental
process
of
enforcing
the
regulatory
program.
they
were
literally
in
compliance
with
the
regulatory
scheme
set
out
in
the
statute
and
ultimately
refined
in
a
resolution
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
it
might.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
don't
think
one
can
say
as
an
absolute.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
discretionary
function
exception
is
not
inherently
categorical.
if
it
could
be
said
in
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
that
the
survival
of
the
institution,
that
the
monitoring
was
close
enough
to
require,
with
respect
to
the
regulated
person,
like
respondent
here,
that
there
was
activity
that
closely
involved
in
day-to-day
operations,
i
suggest
that
it
would
be
protected.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
think
there
are
two
things
that
make
it
a
policy
decision.
one,
as
i
said,
is
it
being
consistent
with
the
regulatory
scheme
and
involving
judgmental
process
and
furtherance
of
it.
the
second,
which
i
believe
is
reflected
in
this
court's
opinion
in
boyle
against
united
technologies,
is
that
it's
action
derived
from
essentially
or
uniquely
federal
interest.
what
is
different
about
these
supervisory
regulators
from
a
normal
director
of
the
bank
is
their
focus.
the
normal
director
is
going
to
have
as
his
primary
activity,
or
her
primary
activity,
maximizing
the
profit
of
investors.
the
supervisory
regulator--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--judgmental.
it
has
to
involve
judgment
in
pursuance
of
the
regulatory
purpose.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
and
second,
it
has
to
be
derived
from
what
is
a
unique
federal
interest.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
well,
under
the
regulations
in
effect
at
the
time,
and
indeed
in
a
different
place
today
but
still
in
effect,
the
supervisory
regulators
were
responsible
for
going
into
the
institution,
and
rather
than
exercising
ultimate
authority,
putting
it
into
receivership,
their
goal
was
to
work
very
closely
with
management,
making
a
number
of
suggestions,
to
see
whether
management
could
eliminate
unsafe
or
unsound
practices.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
it
might.
and
why
i
say--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--well,
what
is
the
unsafe
or
unsound
practice
that
the
regulators
are
looking
at
and
attempting
to
remedy?
if
indeed
it
involved
the
loan
practice
of
the
bank,
if
that
is
something
that
they're
looking
at
specifically,
i
would
answer
the
question
yes.
i
don't--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--well,
the
way
that
that
would
be
done
under
this
regime
is
to
suggest
it
to
the
board
that
was
in
place.
if
the
board
refused
to
go
along
with
those
suggestions,
if
it
didn't
comply
with
what
the
regulators
thought
was
a
sound
policy,
the
regulators
would
then
move
to
another
step,
a
cease
and
desist
order
or
a
conservatorship
or
receivership.
i
don't
know
that...
we
don't
have
it
here,
and
i
don't
know
that
we
would
ever
have
a
realistic
situation
in
which
the
regulators
actually
were
making
the
loans.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
yes,
i
suggest
that
it
would
be.
the
discretionary
function
exception
protects
a
negligent
act.
so
the
fact,
if
the
exception
applies,
it
isn't
going
to
matter
whether
or
not
the
regulator
exercised
due
care.
so
that's
a
secondary
question.
so
the
only
relevant
consideration
is
was
there
an
act
of
discretion,
and
was
it
in
furtherance
of
policy.
here
the
regulators
were
concerned
about
the
quality
of
the
bank's
portfolio
or
the
institution's
portfolio
and
where
it
was
going,
and
i
suggest
that
on
the
face
of
it
hiring
an
advisor
to
look
at
transactions
is
both
a
reasonable
and
proper
exercise
of
discretionary
authority
that
ought
to
be
protected.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
again,
the
discretionary
function
exception
ought
to
protect
that.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
would,
because
there
there
would
be
no
discretion.
that
would
be
very
much
the
same
as
the
berkovitz
decision,
where
there
would
be
a
federal
regulation
program
or
directive
which
preempts--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--the
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
is
discretion
to
hire
a
consultant.
again,
if
there
is
discretion
to
do
that,
the
act
ought
to
be
protected.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
well,
i
agree,
there
is
no
regulation
that
requires
a
particular
method
of
hiring
or
a
particular
evaluation.
there
is...
there
was
a
regulation
and
resolution
in
effect
at
the
time
that
allowed
these
regulators
to
tailor
supervision
depending
upon
the
changing
facts
of
any...
of
any
individual
case.
within
that,
and
indeed
both
courts
below
found
that
this
hiring
was
a
discretionary
act,
so
that
the
question
is,
under
berkovitz,
was
it
an
act
that
was
derived
from
policy.
there
was
nothing
that
set
forth
a
particular
method
of
hiring
a
consultant,
that
set
forth
particular
criteria
for
the
hiring
of
a
consultant,
or
particular
acts
that
the
regulators
had
to
perform.
and
so
that's
the
reason
that
i
suggest
(a)
that
they
had
discretion,
(b)
that
that
discretion
related
to
policy,
hence
if
they
were
negligent
in
that
decision
it
would
be
protected
by
the
literal
terms
of
the
discretionary
function
exception.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
no.
no,
sir.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
the...
as
i
suggested
earlier,
is
it...
under
berkovitz
the
court
reflected
on
the
activity
being
part
of
the
judgmental
process
of
enforcing
the
regulatory
program.
in
boyle
the
court
looked
to
what
it
found
to
be
a
uniquely
federal
interest,
essentially
a
governmental
function
different
from
what
would--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--that
it's
part
of
the
judgmental
process--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--of
enforcing
the
regulatory
program.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
suggest
also
in
this
case
that
there
is
involved
a
uniquely
federal
interest,
and
that
that
is
useful
language
derived
from
the
statute
to
describe
the
applicability
or
not
of
the
discretionary
function
exception.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
well,
i
would
suggest
that
that
did
not
involve
a
uniquely
federal
interest,
given
the
legislative
history
which
preserves
almost
above
anything
else
the
automobile
accident
as
the
common
law
tort--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--reserved.
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
that
instance,
where,
for
example
if
hypothetically
this
respondent
were
involved
in
a
traffic
accident
with
the
regulator
who
was
performing
his
duties,
that
there
would
be
federal...
the
potential
for
federal
liability
because
there
is
no
regulatory
discretion.
similarly,
if
the
regulator
insisted
upon
the
directors
hiring
the
regulator's
brother-in-law,
to
the
extent
that
that
would
violate
federal
conflict
of
interest
law,
there
would
be
no
discretion
to
violate
a
particular
law
which
sets
forth
something,
a
federal
duty.
if
the
regulator
decided,
consistent
with
his
discretion,
to
take
his
papers
home
at
night
that
he
was
working
on
in
pursuit
of
the
regulatory
supervision,
and
he
lost
them,
that
negligent
act
of
losing
the
papers
wouldn't
be
part
of
the
judgmental
process
of
enforcing
the
regulatory
policy,
and
so
it
wouldn't
be
protected.
i
can
think
of
some
cases
that
bring
to
mind
indian
towing.
if
it's
part
of
their...
if
they
had
greater
authority
than
what
they
exercised
in
this
case,
and
actually
decided
to
shut
down
the
lights
on
top
of
a
tall
building
that
had
a
lightning
rod
and
a
plane
crashed
in
it.
or
if
they
negligently
maintained
machinery.
there
is
no
federal
policy
interest
involved
there,
and
so,
under
indian
towing,
rayonier,
other
cases
like
that,
there
would
be
the
potential
for
liability.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
yes.
i
think
that
that's
right.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
well,
it
could,
justice
stevens.
that's
not
the
case
that
we're
facing
here,
where
the
role
of
the
regulators
was
to
evaluate
the
portfolio
and
to
use
an
advisor
in
making
that
evaluation.
but
i
suggest
that
if
that
were
the
focus
of
the
regulation,
if
the
cited
practice
were
the
making
of
bad
loans,
that,
consistent
with
the
regulatory
purpose,
and
exercising
the
judgment
with
respect
to
that,
it
would
be
a
protected
act
for
the
regulators
to
involve
themselves
at
that
level
in
that
way.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
in
this
case--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--i
don't
disagree
with
that.
the
federal
policy...
the
direct
federal
policy
at
play
here
is
to
try
to
restore
this
institution
to
what
the
regulators
consider
to
be
safer,
sounder
financial
practices,
and
returning
it
to
management
and
leaving.
that
didn't
occur.
but
that
is
not
an
unknown
function.
it's
one
that
this
court
recognized
in
terms
of
its
cousin,
the
banking
industry,
back
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
where
it
noted
that
the
federal
supervision
of
banking
has
been
called
probably
the
outstanding
example
of
the
federal
government
of
regulation
of
entire
industry
through
methods
of
supervision,
also
noting,
as
in
this
case,
that
the,
because
of
the
way
that
the
system
works,
that
the
regulators
are
likely
to
follow
the
suggestions
that
the
supervisory...
that
the
directors
are
likely
to
follow
the
suggestions
that
the
supervisory
regulators
make.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
scalia.
the
distinction
that
i
would
draw
is
that
the
driver
is
not
exercising
regulatory
discretion.
of
course
he's
deciding
whether
to
turn
left
or
turn
right
or
speed
up
or
slow
down,
but
what
he
is
not
doing
is
making
any
evaluation
of
the
matter
at
hand,
of
the
health
of
the
institution,
the
policies
that
the
institution
ought
to
undertake
to
return
itself
to
what
the
regulators
consider
to
be
healthy.
there
is
no
regulatory
discretion.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
no,
i'm
saying
that
the
discretionary
function
exception
doesn't
apply
to
the
driver.
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
the
action
of
the
driver,
because
the
driver
is
not
exercising
regulatory
discretion.
that's
the
distinction
that
i
would
draw.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
yes.
acting
with
judgment
in
furtherance
of
the
particular
regulatory
policy.
i
suggest
that
that's
what
the
congress
intended
to--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--i
think
there's
a
possibility
in
as
much
as
in
berkovitz
the
court
described
the
second
fork
of
the
test
as
being
in
furtherance
of
policy.
i
am
sure--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--i
am
sure
that
some...
i
think
it's
most
likely
to
come
up
in
a
regulatory
sense,
but
one
can
envision
activities
that
are
not
purely
regulatory
but
that
further
policy.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
of
course,
the
individual
who
commits
the
particular
act
in
question
has
got
to
be
charged
with
carrying
out
that
particular
policy
or
creating
it,
or
doing
something
along
those
lines.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
except
that
that
is
an
activity
which
i
think
is
likely
spelled
out
in
regulations
as
to
how
one
performs
it
and
what
one
does.
there
is
very
little
choice
that
relates
to
policy
that
is
left
to
the
driver
of
the
wagon
or
car.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
think
that
that
is
correct,
and
i'm
trying
to
define
it
in
terms
of
what
this
court
has
had
to
say
in
cases
on
the
subject,
and
what
the
congress
had
to
say
when
it
created
the
exception
and
the
limitation
to
the
exception
with
particular
reference
to
automobile
accidents.
i
agree
one
ought
to
have
a
consistent,
a
theoretical
view
that
supports
the
exception
to
the
exception,
and
i
think
that
there
is
one,
which
is
that
that
driver
is
not
exercising
any
policy
judgment.
all
he
is
doing
is
driving
the
car.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
think
that
the
answer
has
to
be
the
former
rather
than
the
latter.
if,
if
it's
not
the
case,
what
we
would
end
up
with
is
a
full-scale
trial
in
every
case
that
involves
the
raising
of
the
defense
of
discretionary
function.
even
in
this
case,
while
the
respondent
suggests
that
his
case
is
unique
and
there
is
no
flood
gates,
we
now
have
in
the
justice
department
321
tort
cases
involving
the
savings
and
loan
system.
and
i
would
suggest
that
what
the
court
had
to
say
in
dalehite,
which
was
that
one
only
need
read
the
discretionary
function
exception
in
its
entirety
to
conclude
that
congress
exercised
care
to
protect
the
government
from
claims,
however
negligently
caused,
that
affected
the
governmental
function,
that
you
would
be
acting
contrary
to
that
if
we
had
to
have
a
full-scale
hearing
to
decide
in
each
and
every
case
what
the
regulator
did
rely
on.
so
the
test
ought
to
be
susceptibility.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
agree
that
it's
fact
specific
in
many,
if
not
most
cases,
because
you
need
to
look
at
the
facts
to
see
whether
there
is
an
activity
that
requires
the
exercise
of
discretion.
but
if
you
reach
that
plateau,
and
if
it's
susceptible,
if
the
activity
is
susceptible
to
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
the
furtherance
of
policy,
that
that
ought
to
end
the
inquiry.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
might,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
us
see
what
it
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
actually
did
hold
with
respect
to
the
operational
distinction.
at
885
fed.
2d,
at
1287,
the
court
specifically
held,
relying
upon...
that
indian
towing,
quote,
"did
however
establish
a
principal
distinction
between
policy
decisions
and
operational
actions.
"
this
distinction
still
retains
its
force
today
and
is
dispositive
of
this
case...
of
these
cases.
at
page
1289
the
court
of
appeals
held,
quote,
"thus
the
fhlbb
and
fhlb-dallas
officials
were
only
protected
by
the
discretionary
function
exception
until
their
actions
became
operational
in
nature,
and
thus
crossed
the
line
established
in
indian
towing.
"
the
fifth
circuit's
reference
to
berkovitz
cannot
represent
any
shorthand
for
the
appropriate
test.
any
such
suggestion
must
be
undone
by
the
court's
reference
to
indian
towing
as
the
source
of
the
operational
distinction.
in
terms
of
indian
towing,
which,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
was
not
a
discretionary
function
case,
operational
means
no
discretion
at
all,
as
well
as
no
federal
policy
countervailing
the
statute...
the
state,
in
that
case
good
samaritan
law.
this
complaint
was
amended
after
some
period
of
time,
and
the
particular
acts
set
forth
are
the
ones
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on.
however,
it
is
very
clear,
i
suggest,
that
there
is
indeed
an
antecedent
policy
here.
there
is
a
statute,
two
statutes,
which
are
cited,
a
regulation
in
furtherance
of
that,
and
in
particular
a
resolution,
all
designed
to
further
the
antecedent...
the
twin
antecedent
policies
of
protecting
depositor
accounts
and
safeguarding
the
taxpayer
supported
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
fund.
those
policies
long
predate
this
case,
as
does
the
resolution
statute
and
regulation
which
premise
the
regulatory
activity
here.
as
to
the
particular
acts
in
question,
i
would
note
that
at
least
some
courts
of
appeals,
including
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
case
we
cite
in
the
brief,
williamson
against
department
of
agriculture,
has
recognized
that
decisions
regarding
the
credit
worthiness
of
individual
loan
applicants
are
discretionary
functions
in
the
context
of
a
federal
loan
program.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
i
suppose
that
they...
i
set
forth
more
than
just
driving
the
car.
i
talked
about
the
decision
to
hire
in
violation
of
conflict
of
interest
standard,
taking
the
papers
home
and
losing
them,
the
failure
to
adequately
maintain
machinery
that
causes
damages.
i
don't
think...
i
can't
think
of
anything
with
respect
to
mr.
gaubert
as
the
regulated
person
or
entity
in
this
case,
on
these
facts,
that
would
fall
without
the
exception.
but
i
do
suggest
that
there
are
any
number
of
things
where,
where
the...
you
can
hypothesize
that
the
regulators
here...
as
in
berkovitz,
i
assume
that
the
regulators
in
berkovitz
did
not
intentionally
violate
the
policies
and
procedures
that
stripped
them
of
discretion.
and
if
something...
if
there
was
something
like
that
here
and
the
regulators
violated
those
policies,
albeit
unknowingly,
then,
i
think,
under
berkovitz
that
the...
that
negligence
would
be
actionable.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
well,
i
would--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--i
think
it's
unlikely
that
such
activities
would
involve
directly
the
federal
regulatory
policy
interest
here
and
the
exercise
of
judgment
with
respect
to
those
things.
i
would
countenance
that
under
some
circumstances
where
the
life
and
death
of
the
institution
was
at
issue,
that
perhaps
there
was
a
policy
interest
that
transcended
the...
this
activity.
but
i
would
also
suggest
that
in
virtually
every
such
case,
and
we
have
nothing
like
it
here,
there
is
a
specific
federal
policy
mandate
to
obey
the
traffic
laws,
to
maintain
equipment,
to
precheck
vaccines
before
they're
cleared.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
no,
i
don't
think
that
it...
i
don't
think
that...
i
mean,
if
we're
saying
that,
we
shouldn't
be
saying
that.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
that's
not
our--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--well,
the
issue
of
suasion
and
the
fact
that
the
advice
could
be
avoided
relates
to
what
i
suggest
is
a
different
point,
which
is
that
what
the
respondent
here,
we
suggest,
is
trying
to
litigate
is
what
he
calls
in
his
brief
the
extra-regulatory
takeover
of
the
institution.
and
i
would
suggest,
in
the
sense
that...
at
which
point
this
individual
felt
that
that
had
occurred,
there
are
other
kinds
of
causes
of
action
and
other
places
to
litigate
such
a
claim,
that
it's
clearly
within
congressional
intendment
that
a
tort
activity...
a
tort
action
is
not
one
of
them.
i
suggest,
though,
that
there
is
no
operative...
there
is
no
inherently
operative,
inherent
distinction
related
to
the
use
of
moral
suasion.
this
court
has
noted,
as
i
say,
in
philadelphia
bank,
in
philadelphia
national
bank
in
1963,
that
moral
suasion
was
commonly
used,
and
that
that's
the,
that's
the
backbone
of--
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
--well,
economic
suasion
i
guess
you
would
call
it.
mr.
stuart
m.
gerson
that's
a
fair
point.
and
that
that
sort
of
advice
is
generally
followed,
and
that's
what
makes
for
a
successful
system,
a
system
which
is
described
in
the
regulation
here.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
