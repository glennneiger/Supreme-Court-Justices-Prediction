justice
scalia
mr.
gerson,
what
if
the
federal
officials
undertook
to
actually
supervise
the
granting
of
particular
loans,
deciding
loan
by
loan
whether
this
particular
real
estate
is
likely
to
be
valuable
enough
to
be
sound
collateral,
and
so
forth?
does
that
meet
your
test?
justice
scalia
i
know
it
might.
it
also
might
not.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
that
is
what
makes
it
a
policy
decision?
justice
scalia
let
me
get
those
two.
those
two
things
that
make
it
policy
are,
number
one,
it
has
to
be
in
pursuance
of
a
federal
purpose?
justice
scalia
and
secondly?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
it
relates
to
policy
if
there
is
no
regulation
that
governs
it?
is
that
the
test
of
whether
it
relates
to
policy?
justice
scalia
what
is
the
test
of
whether
it
relates
to
policy?
justice
scalia
i
don't
care
what
all
the
cases
say.
what
is
your
test
of
whether
it
relates
to
policy?
just,
you
know--
justice
scalia
--part
of
the
judgmental
process--
justice
scalia
--of
enforcing
the
regulatory
program.
justice
scalia
so,
so
i
assume
that
if
one
of
the
problems
with
these
banks
was
they
were
getting
sued
too
often
for
automobile
accidents
by
negligent...
because
of
their
negligent
employees
driving
the
bank's
cars,
and
if
the
federal
examiners
should
prescribe
how
to
drive
the
car,
you
know,
don't
take
a
left
turn,
or
something
like
that,
and
if
that
should
cause
an
accident,
that
would
be
a
policy
judgment
then?
right?
because
it
was
in
furtherance...
judgmental
in
furtherance
of
the
federal
program.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
scalia
even
if
that
was
done
to
save
money?
justice
scalia
mr.
gerson,
i...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it's
fair
play
to
simply
make
an
automobile-driving
exception
to
your
principle
because
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
automobile
driving
is
excluded
because
it's
not
a
discretionary
function,
and
whatever
your
definition
of
discretionary
function
is,
it
has
to
exclude
automobile
driving.
and
i
don't
see
how...
let's
say
the
post
office,
if
the
post
office
were
still
a
full
dress
federal
agency,
and
you
have
a
post
office
driver
who's
delivering
the
mail.
i
mean,
that's
certainly
a
federal
policy,
and
in
the
act
of
it
he
gets
into
an
automobile
accident.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
meet
your
definition
of
being
in
performance
of
a
federal
function.
justice
scalia
well,
the
post
office
doesn't
regulate.
it
gets
mail
from
here
to
there.
he
is
performing
that
function
in
getting
the
mail
from
here
to
there.
are
you
saying
the
function
only
applies
to
regulatory
agencies?
justice
scalia
regulatory
discretion.
justice
scalia
so,
if
it's
a
federal
government
that
does
not
regulate,
but
that
just
provides
federal
services,
there
is
no
regulation
of
private
activity
involved,
it
gives
out
money
or
it
does
things
of
that
sort,
there
is
no
possibility
of
having
a
discretionary
function
exception
at
all?
justice
scalia
so
it
doesn't
have
to
be
regulatory
policy.
justice
scalia
a
whole
lot
of
activities.
justice
scalia
0
[inaudible].
justice
scalia
that
depends
on
how
you
define
policy.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
if
you
go
on
to
that
second
step
anyway,
what's
the
use
of
the
first
step?
i
mean,
what's
the
use
of
deciding
whether
it's
planning
or
operational?
justice
scalia
what's
the
use
of
characterizing
it
is
what
i
want
to
know.
it
could
be
at
the
planning
level
and
not
be
so
important
to
the
furtherance
of
the
program,
or
it
could
be
at
the
operational
level
and
be
important.
justice
scalia
so
why
take
that
first
step?
justice
scalia
--when
you
say
they
set
the
salary,
you
mean
they
told
the
person
who
set
the
salary
what
salary
he
would
set?
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
he
set
his
own
salary?
did
he
sign
a
piece
of
paper
that
had
the
legal
effect
of
setting
his
salary?
or
rather,
did
he
tell
the
person
who
had
that
power?
justice
scalia
the
latter.
justice
scalia
the
person
to
whom
he
said
that
was
the
person
who
had
the
authority
to
pay
that
amount
or
not.
justice
scalia
correct?
that
person
could
have
said
no.
justice
scalia
i
just
want
to
know
what
you
mean
by
the
fact
that
he
set
his
salary,
and
that
he
did
it.
justice
scalia
somebody
else
had
the
power
to
do
it,
and
he
had
power
over
that
person.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
mr.
lowell,
you
know,
just
as
agencies
sometimes
make
policy
by
regulation,
they
sometimes
make
it
by
adjudication
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
so
you
can't
say
simply
because
they
chose
to
do
it
this
way
that
that
wasn't
an
expression
of
the
agency
policy.
they
might
have
been
doing
it
the
same
way
elsewhere.
justice
scalia
the
mere
fact
that
there's
no
regulation
governing
it
does
not
mean
it's
not
a
policy
decision.
you
often
make
policy
case
by
case.
we
make
policy
case
by
case.
justice
scalia
mr.
lowell,
in
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
you
insisted
that
there
had
to
be...
that
there
must
have
been
an
antecedent
policy.
that
is
really
what
you're
urging,
that
there
has
to
be
an
antecedent
policy?
justice
scalia
oh,
so
there
has
to
be
antecedent,
not
excluding
the
possibility
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
antecedent?
justice
scalia
well,
but
isn't
it
in
a
sense?
i
mean,
if...
you
can
have
a
policy
that
says
no,
no
loans
on
real
estate
worth
less
than
$500,000,
or
you
can
have
a
conservator
in
possession
who
then,
who...
when
the
first
thing
comes
up
to
him,
says
i'm
not
going
to
make
a
loan
on
property
worth
less
than
$500,000.
why
is
one
a
policy
decision
and
the
other
one
not?
justice
scalia
mr.
gerson,
could
you
give
us
an
example
of
an
act
that
these
regulators
could
have
taken
that
they
thought
was
in
furtherance
of
their
mission
to
salvage
these
s&l's,
which
would
not
come
within
the
discretionary
function
exemption?
anything
at
all
other
than
driving
a
car?
justice
scalia
just,
just
tell
me
again
why
failure
to
maintain
the
machines
or
closing
down
the
lights,
the
other
example
that
you
gave,
why
that
would
not
come
within
the
discretion...
i
mean,
it's
all
done
to
save
money
to
this
institution
that
is
losing
money.
justice
scalia
why
would
it
not
come
within
the
exemption?
justice
scalia
well,
i
would
suppose--
--in
your
brief
it
sounds
as
though...
in
some
places
it
sounds
as
though
you're
saying
that
because
advice,
rather,
is
all
that
is
involved,
not
any
orders
or
anything
like
that,
that
that's
a
separate
defense
wholly
aside
from
discretionary
function.
