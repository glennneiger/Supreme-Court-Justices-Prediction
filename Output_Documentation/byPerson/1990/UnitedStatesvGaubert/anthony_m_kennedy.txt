suppose
the
advisor
was
absolutely
unqualified,
had
no
experience
in
banking
whatsoever?
justice
kennedy
how
is
that
any
different
than,
say,
in
the
varig
case?
you'll
recall
that
was
the
spot-inspection
policy.
but
not
involved
in
that
case
was
an
instance,
a
hypothetical
instance
where
an
inspector
might
have
made
an
inspection
and
missed
a
structural
defect
in
the
aircraft.
i
take
it
you
would
concede
that
in
varig
that
if
the
inspector
had
made
an
inspection
of
a
specific
aircraft
and
had
done
it
negligently,
there
would
be
liability?
justice
kennedy
you
say
there's
discretion
to
hire
a
totally
unqualified,
incompetent
consultant?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
it
depends
on
how
you
phrase
the
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
you
have
to
inspect
an
aircraft.
justice
kennedy
does
your
exception
apply
whenever
policy
considerations
might
influence
the
judgment,
or
when
they
do
influence
the
judgment?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
test
necessarily
is
fact
specific
in
many
cases.
justice
kennedy
and
their
action--
justice
kennedy
--their
actions
constituted
more
than
simply
giving
advice?
justice
kennedy
well,
did
the
regulators
purport
to
be
exercising
legal
control
over
the
actions
and
the
policies
of
the
thrift?
justice
kennedy
well,
are
there
any
specific
acts
that
they
took
in
the
name
of
the
savings
and
loan
on
their
own
initiative?
justice
kennedy
i
thought
that
was...
was
that
mediation
or
did
they
set
the
salary?
did
they
order--
justice
kennedy
well,
what
power
did
he
have
over
that
person?
justice
kennedy
where
is
this
alleged
in
the
complaint?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
is
there
in
the
complaint
that
indicates
that
the
government
and
its
regulators
took
active
control
as
opposed
to
simply
offering
advice?
justice
kennedy
no,
it
says
it
mediated
the
salary
dispute,
if
that's
the
one
you're
referring
to.
that's
at
(d)
at
page
15.
justice
kennedy
that's
all
that
it
says.
