dawud
majid
mu'min
v.
virginia.
mr.
blume?
let's
move
along,
please,
at
the
counsel
table.
we
have
another
case.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
blume.
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
did
allow
questions
as
to
whether
they
had
seen
media
accounts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
you
saw
was
to
interrogate
the
jurors
who
said
they
had
seen
something
about
what
it
was
they
had
seen?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there's
not
a
whole
lot
left
of
irvin
after
murphy
against
florida
and
patton
against
yount.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
to
follow
that
through,
mr.
blume.
what
is...
what
is
the
goal
of
these
further
questions?
to
exercise
peremptories,
to
challenge
for
cause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so...
but
i
mean,
what
specifically
are
you
trying
to
develop?
challenges
for
cause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
mean...
but
from
your...
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant?
chief
justice
rehnquist
excused
for
cause.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
kind
of--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
kind
of
voir
dire
you're
talking
about
with
justice
scalia,
mr.
blume,
would
have
to
be
sequestered
voir
dire.
you
don't
want
a
juror
standing
up
in
front
of
the
whole
panel
and
saying,
well,
i
read
that
he'd
been
such
and
such,
and
such
and
such,
and
thereby
infecting
every
other
member
of
the
panel.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
the
chief
justice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you...
you
would...
you
would
have
had
to
sequestered
the
individual
being
interrogated...
the
venire
person
being
interrogated...
from
the
rest
of
the
potential
jurors,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
answer
my
question
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--he's
finally
going
to
have
to
accept
it
one
way
or
the
other
even
at
the
end
of
this...
of
the
series
of
questions
you
want
to
propose...
the
final
question
still
is,
in
spite
of
what
you've
heard,
can
you
be
impartial?
the
juror
says,
yes.
and
the
judge
still
makes
a
certain
subjective
assessment;
is
this
juror
tell
the
truth?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
if...
the
u.s.
constitution
requires
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
blume.
mr.
mclees,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
this
case
was
tried
where...
in
prince
william
county?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what...
the
county
seat
is
manassas?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the...
what's
the
approximate
population
of
prince
william
county?
a
couple
hundred
thousand?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
mclees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
to
announce.
the
first
is
no.
90-5193,
mu’min
against
virginia.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
the
petitioner,
mu’min,
was
an
inmate
serving
time
for
first
degree
murder
and
he
then
committed
another
murder
while
out
of
prison
on
a
work
detail.
the
case
engendered
substantial
publicity,
in
the
local
news
media,
occurred
in
prince
william
county
which
is
basically
suburban
virginia,
the
virginia
suburbs
of
washington.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
petitioner’s
motion
for
individual
voir
dire
of
the
jurors,
individual
examination
of
the
jurors
before
the
case,
and
refused
to
ask
any
of
his
proposed
questions
relating
to
the
content
of
news
items
that
potential
jurors
might
have
seen
or
read.
instead,
the
judge
engaged
in
which
you
might
call
a
two-part
voir
dire
examination
of
the
jurors.
first,
he
questioned
the
perspective
jurors
as
a
group
asking
four
questions
about
the
effect
on
them
of
pre-trial
publicity
or
information
about
the
case
obtained
by
other
means.
second,
he
asked
additional
questions
of
potential
jurors
and
panels
of
four,
and
each
time
a
juror
indicated
that
he
had
acquired
knowledge
about
the
case
from
outside
sources,
he
was
asked
whether
he
had
formed
an
opinion.
two
jurors
who
admitted
to
having
formed
a
belief
as
to
mu’min’s
guilt
or
who
were
equivocal
as
to
their
impartiality
were
excused
for
cause
by
the
judge
on
his
own
motion.
although
eight
of
the
twelve
jurors
eventually
impaneled
admitted
that
they
had
read
or
heard
something
about
the
case,
none
indicated
that
they
had
formed
an
opinion
as
to
petitioner’s
guilt.
the
jury
found
mu’min
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
the
judge
sentenced
him
to
death.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
affirmed
finding
while
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
ask
whether
a
juror
has
previously
acquired
any
information
about
the
case,
a
criminal
defendant
does
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
explore
the
content
of
the
acquired
information.
in
a
decision
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
conviction
and
hold
that
the
trial
judge’s
refusal
to
question
perspective
jurors
about
the
specific
contents
of
the
news
reports
to
which
he
had
been
exposed
did
not
violate
mu’min’s
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
jury
or
his
right
to
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
cases
have
stressed
the
wide
discretion
granted
to
trial
courts
in
conducting
voir
dire
in
the
area
of
pretrial
publicity
and
in
other
areas
that
might
tend
to
show
juror
bias.
while
adverse
pre-trial
publicity
can
create
a
presumption
of
prejudice,
where
the
locale
is
simply
swamp
with
publicity,
this
is
not
such
a
case.
the
trial
court
was
not
faced
with
a
huge
waive
of
public
passion
that
might
have
required
more
extensive
examination
of
potential
jurors
that
it
undertook
here.
so,
we
hold
that
what
the
trial
judge,
in
this
case
did,
did
not
violate
the
constitution.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
all
but
part
four
of
which
justices
blackmun
and
stevens
have
joined;
and
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
