justice
o'connor
well,
let's...
let's
talk
about
that
precise
point.
i
thought
that
in
patton
against
yount
we
said
that
the
state
trial
court's
finding
of
impartiality
could
only
be
overturned
from
manifest
error.
now,
i
take
it
the
rule
you
want
us
to
adopt
is
one
that
says
anytime
there's
a
lot
of
pretrial
media
coverage
in
a
capital
case,
that
absent
content
questions
such
as
you
proposed
during
voir
dire
that
we're
going
to
be
able
to
presume
that
that's
manifest
error.
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
we
have
to
distinguish,
don't
we,
to
some
extent
whether
it
is
a
proceeding
arising
in
state
court
or
one
in
federal
court.
certainly,
we
can
impose
different
requirements
in
federal
court
than
we
would
be
required
to
impose
by
the
due
process
clause
for
state
court
proceedings.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
you
have
here
a
determination
by
the
trial
court
judge
that
the
jurors
who
were
impanelled
were
fair
and
impartial.
and
he
made
that
determination
based
on
their
responses
to
these
generalized
inquiries.
justice
o'connor
mr.
blume,
in
turner
against
murray
on
which
you
place
some
reliance,
where
the
concern
was
the
refusal
or
failure
by
the
trial
court
to
ask
some
voir
dire
questions
about
racial
bias,
the
court
left
in
place
the
conviction,
did
it
not?
justice
o'connor
and
yet
you
think
that
we
have
to
overturn
your
client's
conviction?
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
square
that
with
what
the
court
did
in
turner?
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
think
the
rule
ought
to
be?
apparently
we
have
indicated
in
irvin
against
dowd
and
patton
against
yount
that
pretrial
publicity
in
some
cases
may
create
some
presumption
of
prejudice.
what
do
you
think
the
rule
is?
what
are
those
cases?
justice
o'connor
i
don't
understand
what
rule
you
propose
we
adopt.
i'm...
i
maybe
misunderstand,
but
i...
what
is
it
you're
saying
is
our
rule?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
regardless
of
the
pretrial
publicity
and
the
particular
circumstances
that
the
generalized
questions
asked
by
the
trial
judge
here
would
always
be
sufficient?
justice
o'connor
so
would
you
acknowledge
that
sometimes
content
questions
must
be
asked?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
in
some
cases
they
would
be
constitutionally
required?
justice
o'connor
yes.
and
how
do
we
draw
that
line?
how
do
we
know
when
they
have
to
be
asked?
