mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
tried
in
manassas.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
your
honor,
in
1988
at
the
time
this
case...
or
at
the
time
this
publicity
occurred,
the
approximate
population
was
194,700,
your
honor.
that's
not
in
the
record,
but
it
is
in
public
records.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
today,
dawud
mu'min
asks
the
court
to
rule
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
as
he
argues
in
page
38
of
his
opening
brief,
that
impartiality
of
a
juror
must
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
information
elicited
by
the
court
or
counsel
regarding
the
content
of
the
publicity
to
which
that
juror
has
been
exposed.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
logic
of
his
rule
extends
to
inquiries
of
that
sort.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
yes,
details
of
sources
as
well
as
content.
we
contend
that
the
adoption
of
such
an
inflexible
rule
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
is
unnecessary
in
order
to
ensure
the
defendant
a
fair
trial--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--i...
your
honor,
i
think
the
rule
should
be
that
first,
content
questioning
of
the
sort
we're
discussing
here
is
a
tool
like
any
other.
it
is
a
tool
which
the
trial
court
may
find
helpful
in
picking
a
jury,
but
it
is
a
tool
which
the
trial
court
in
his
or
her
discretion
may
choose
to
use
or
not
use
in
order
to
ensure
that
the--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--that...
the
rule
should
be,
your
honor,
that
the
use
of
content
questioning
is
one
of
the
many
matters
that
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
in
conducting
a
voir
dire,
because
there
are
a
number
of
other
objective
factors
which
the
court
can
consider.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
it--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--yes,
i
would.
it
must
be
sufficient
to
ensure
that
the
defendant
receives
a
fair
trial
before
a
fair
tribunal.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
i
think
that
it
is...
yes.
i
think
that
in
a
high
publicity
case,
that
questioning
should
be
addressed
toward
publicity.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
well,
we're
arguing,
your
honor...
i
think
it's
more
than
whether
the
trial
court
abused
its
discretion
in
this
case.
i
think
we're
arguing
as...
whether
the
court
is
required
to
include
content
questioning
in
that
reasonable
inquiry...
whether
the
trial
court
has...
without
content
questioning,
whether
the
trial
court
can
make
a
reliable
determination
as
to
whether
the
juror's
statement
of
impartiality
can
be--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
what
he
has
maintained
both
in
his
brief
and
in
oral
argument
is
that
the
error
of
the
trial
court
here
is
in
not
asking
any
content
questions
and
that
content
questions
are
a
sine
qua
non
of
a
determination
that
a
juror
can
be
believed
when
they
say,
i
will
not
be
affected
in
my
judgment
by
the
pretrial
publicity.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
that
we
can...
that
we
can
make
a
broad
statement
to
that
effect.
i
think
that--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--i
don't
necessarily
acknowledge
there
is
any
particular
circumstance
where
this
court
can
draw
a
bright-line
rule
and
say,
here,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
content
questions
are
required.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
it
would
depend...
yes,
justice
o'connor,
yes.
it
would
depend--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--by
applying
the
objective
factors
that
this
court
laid
down
in
murphy
v.
florida
for
determining
when
there
is
reason
to
question
the
veracity
or
the
reliability
of
a
juror's
assurances
that
they
can
be
impartial.
in
this
case,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
trial
court
could
assume
for
the
purpose
of
judgment,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
every
juror
had
read
everything
in
the
articles
that
were
demonstrated
in
the
record.
and--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
trial
court--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--i
think
that...
yes,
he
would.
and
i
think--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
it's
different
from
this
case
because
as...
when...
once
the
jury
is
impanelled
and
the
jury
is
instructed,
of
course,
that
they
are
to
decide
the
case
based
solely
on
the
law
and
the
evidence
that
comes
in
in
the
courtroom,
then
a
breach
of
that
instruction
of
the
court...
a
breach
of
the
juror's
duty
by
receiving
some
other
sort
of
information...
is
an
exception.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it...
it
require
that
the
juror
be
guilty
of
wrong
doing,
but
that's
an
exception
to
the
rule.
the
rule
is
the
juror
doesn't
receive
any
outside
information.
the
rule
has
been
breached
here
because
the
juror
saw
this
information
lying
on
the
table.
i
think
that...
because
that's
the
exception
to
the
rule,
that
merits
specific
inquiry,
and
also
it
merits
specific
inquiry
because
it's
so
much
more
immediate
and
it's
a
fact
in
the
very
bosom
of
the
court,
in
the
jury
room,
the--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--we...
justice
stevens,
we
never
know
necessarily
everything
that
may
affect
a
given
individual
who
comes
to
court
to
sit
on
jury
duty.
in
any
case,
regardless
of
whether
there's
pretrial
publicity
or
not,
a
juror
may
have
ridden
up
in
the
courthouse
elevator
with
someone
who
made
a
comment
about
the
bad
person
who
was
on
trial
that
day.
but
we
can't
hope
to
ask
everything
specifically--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--but
that...
bringing
that
out
is
not
going
to
help
the
trial
judge
necessarily
determine
whether
he
believes
the
juror
can
set
that
aside
as
the
juror
responds--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
the
trial
judge
needs
to
know
that
in
every
case.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
it
may
help
in
some
cases,
justice
stevens.
that's
why
i
say
in
some
cases
a
trial
judge
at
his
or
her
discretion
may
find
it
helpful
to
ask
content
questions.
i'm
saying
that
it
should
not
be
required
as
an
inflexible
constitutional
rule.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
i
don't--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
can
draw
a
line
to
say
when
content
questioning
is
required
and
when
it
is
not.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
discretionary
ruling
that
each
case
must
be
decided
on
its
own
facts
and
circumstances.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
what
the
court
must
do
in
order
to...
to
determine
whether
there's
reason
to
question
a
juror's
statement
that
regardless
of
what
i
read
or
heard
in
the
media
or
on
the
street,
i
can
judge
this
case
fairly
and
impartially,
is
evaluate
the
other
factors
this
court
spelled
out
in
murphy
v.
florida.
and
specifically
in
murphy,
this
court
said
that
the
timing
of
the
publicity
should
be
considered.
in
this
case,
the
vast
bulk
of
the
publicity
occurred
more
than
3
months
before
mu'min's
trial
commenced.
in--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
that...
that
is
essentially
what
mu'min
sought
to
ask
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
not
in
those
words,
but
that's
the
essence
of
what
he
sought
to
ask
and--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--well,
we
submit
that
that
is
not
constitutionally
required.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
your
honor,
the...
if
we...
if
we
accept
a
rule
that
that
question
itself
must
be
asked
in
order
to
uncover
that...
that
specific
item
of
bias
that
your
honor
referred
to--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--rather
than
the
general
questions
which
this
court
asked...
and
by
the
way
in...
with
respect
to
the
publicity,
the
trial
judge
rephrased
the
question
five
different
ways
as
far
as
whether
they
could
impartial.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
would
i
object
to
that
question,
your
honor?
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
i
would
certainly
object
to
it
being
constitutionally
required.
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
it's
constitutionally
required,
because
it
assumes...
to
say
that
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
assess
the
jurors'
veracity
when
they
say
they
can
be
impartial.
it
assumes
that
you
can't...
that
a
juror's
statements
are
inherently
suspect
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
mu'min's
theory
is
that
it
runs
counter
to
one
of
the
basic
assumptions
that
our
system
of
trial
by
jury
is
founded
on.
this
court
rejected
the
idea
that
a
jury's
statements
of
impartiality
are
inherently
suspect
in
smith
v.
phillips.
even
in
the
context
of
a
postverdict
hearing
where
a
juror
was
accused
of
misconduct,
in
a
sense,
in
developing
a
bias
during
the
course
of
trial.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
well,
the
difference
is
that
by
requiring
that
the
court
or
counsel
ask
the
juror
to
recount
what
they've
heard
or
read
or
learned
outside
the
courtroom,
you
assume
or
you
imply
that
the
juror's
statement
that
i
haven't
heard
anything...
i
don't
know
anything
about
this
case
that
i
can't
put
aside
and
be
fair
and
impartial.
the
juror's
statement
when
he
comes
into
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
i
have
no
opinion
about
this
case,
which
all
the
jurors
in
the
panel
in
this
case
said,
except
juror
syphrett,
hold--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
as
a
trial
judge
in
dealing
with
that
situation,
the
judge
needs
to
consider
the
demeanor
of
the
juror.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
well,
of
course,
the
jurors
in
this
case
were
aware
of
what
they
had
read
or
heard
about
the
case.
it's
not
a
situation
where
a
juror
needs
to
be
confronted
with
some
unknown
item
of
information
about
the
case
which
might
engender
or
trigger
a
bias
that
they're
not
aware
of
with
general
question.
what
they...
the
jurors
in
this
case
come
into
court
aware
of
what
they
have
read
or
heard
and
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
the
court
is
going
to
be
required
to
make
them
reveal
that.
as
far
as--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--i
didn't...
i
didn't
mean--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
i
said--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--in
determining
whether
the
court
has
reason
to
doubt
a
juror's
assurances
of
impartiality.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
not
the
supreme
court,
your
honor.
trial
courts
will,
and
trial
courts
do,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--the
nature
of
the
publicity
itself...
what
it
reflected
in
the
publicity.
in
this
case,
the
publicity
is
factual
in
nature
to
the
extent
that
there
was
outrage
expressed.
it
was
expressed
at
the
virginia
department
of
corrections,
and
mu'min's
counsel
tried
to
turn
that
to
his
advantage
in
arguing
in
mitigation,
putting
the
department
of
corrections
on
trial
and
taking
the
heat
off
his
client.
another
factor
that
should
be
considered
is
the
atmosphere
of
the
community.
there
was
no
demonstration
in
this
case
of
a
hostile
community
atmosphere.
this
is
a
large,
busy
suburban
community
and
they
have
other
things
on
their
mind
besides
this
one
very
tragic
case.
the
court
should
consider
the
trial
atmosphere
itself.
in
this
case,
the
trial
atmosphere
was
impeccable.
the
court
should
consider
the
number
of
jurors
in
the
voir
dire
process
who
express
some
kind
of
negative
opinion
about
the
defendant
or
about
the
case.
in
this
case,
the
only
juror
who
expressed
a
negative
opinion
was
juror
syphrett
and
he
was
excused
for
cause
by
the
trial
court
without
even
giving
the
commonwealth
the
opportunity
to
try
to
rehabilitate
him.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
well,
i
think--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--not
exactly,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
an
abuse
of
discretion
may,
in
some
conceivable
cases,
amount
to
a
constitutional
violation,
but
that
in
the
normal...
in
the
normal
case
that
is
not
the
case.
the
other
factors
that
are
involved
are
the
demeanor
of
the
jurors
during
voir
dire.
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
was
sensitive
to
the
demeanor
of
the
jurors.
that's
demonstrated
by
the
voir
dire
of
juror
haines,
who
gave
all
the
right
answers
in
black
and
white
on
the
record,
but
the
trial
judge
detected
something
in
her
demeanor
that
suggested
she
wasn't
being
as
candid
as
she
might
be
and
excused
her
for
cause.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
many
specific
questions
were
asked
in
this
case
on
factors
where
the
trial
judge
in
his
discretion
found
that
they
were
appropriate.
the
trial
court
asked
two
questions
addressing
the
racial
aspects
of
the
case.
they
asked
a
question
addressing
the
aspect
of
the
case
as
a
sexual
crime.
they
asked
a
question
about
jurors'
attitudes
toward
people
of
the
islamic
faith.
and
the
jurors
were
candid
and
open.
they
didn't
feel
reticent
in
responding
to
these.
we've
got
two
jurors
speaking
up
and
saying
they
didn't
approve
of
the
islamic
faith.
we've
got
mr.
syphrett
saying
straight
out
that
he
can't
be
fair.
we've
got
ms.
deiotte
saying
that
she
thinks
she
can
be
fair,
but
you
never
really
know
until
you
test
it.
and
she
was
excused
for
cause,
which
does
not
appear
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
on
page
329
of
the
appendix
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
it
shows
that
she
was
excused
for
cause.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
they...
on
the
record,
they
were
not.
i
have--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--this
is
direct
appeal,
your
honor.
there's
been
no--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--no,
no,
sir.
there
has
been
nothing.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
no.
the
trial
court
always
asks
questions,
but
the
trial
court
is
required
by
law
to
permit
counsel
to
ask
questions
also,
and
in
fact,
this
case
the
trial
court
permitted
counsel
to
ask
extensive
questions.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
exactly.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
in
this
case,
the
defense
counsel
asked
many
questions
in
panels
of
four
and
three
and--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
no,
that's
the...
that's
the
controversy.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
although
when
the
trial
court
found
it
necessary
and--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--well,
he
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
go
into
that
in
order
to
determine
that
he
believed
those
jurors
when
they
said
they
could
be
fair.
he...
when
the
trial
court
found
it
helpful
or
necessary
to
go
into
content
questioning,
in
this
case
he
did
so.
with
juror
walters...
now
each
of
these
jurors
in
panels
of
four
was
questioned
by
defense
counsel
about
whether
they
had
discussed
the
case
with
anyone...
so
they
addressed
not
just,
what
have
you
read
in
the
newspaper,
but
they
knew
who
had
or
had
not
discussed
the
case
which
of
course
involved...
would
involve
information
that
wasn't
in
the--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--in
one
panel,
several
gentlemen
indicated
they
discussed
it
with
their
wives
when
they'd
read
about
it
in
the
newspaper
and
the
trial
judge
said,
we
don't
need
to
go
into
the
content
of
that.
in
another
panel,
ms.
walters
indicated...
was
the
only
one
in
another
panel
who
indicated
that
she'd
discussed
it
with
someone.
she
was
a
school
crossing
guard
employed
by
the
prince
william
county
police
and
she
said
she
had
discussed
it
with
her
lieutenant,
who
was
her
supervisor
in
her
job.
and
in
that
case,
the
trial
court
and
defense
counsel
both
inquired
into
the
content
of
the
conversation
she'd
had
with
her
supervisor
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that
examination,
mu'min
elected
not
to
challenge
ms.
walters
for
cause
and
didn't
use
any
peremptory
challenge
against
her
either.
and
in
fact,
ms.
walters
did
sit
and
try
this
case.
in
other
panels,
where...
in
one
panel
a
juror
indicated
that
he
had
discussed
the
case
just
casually
and
the
judge
didn't
feel
it
necessary
in
that
situation
to
go
into
the
content
of
his
discussions.
in
another
panel,
a
woman
said
that
she
had
discussed
the
case
with
several
people
and
she
was
excused
for
cause
for
a
different
reason.
and
in
a
final
panel,
juror
deiotte
indicated
that
she
had
discussed
the
case
with
certain
people.
ms.
deiotte
was
employed
in
the
news
media
and
eventually
she
was
excused
for
cause,
because
she...
she
said
that
she
knew
one
of
the
witnesses
in
the
case
and
she
really
felt
that
that
might
influence
her
impartiality.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
yes,
sir.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
small
panel
voir
dire,
mu'min
did
not
renew
his
motion
for
change
of
venue,
and
we
submit
that
this
may
be
indicative
that
in
his
mind
at
that
point,
having
concluded
the
entire
voir
dire,
concerns
about
the
impartiality
of
the
jury
were
not
uttermost
in
his
mind.
now,
the
assumption
that
is
involved
in
mu'min's
position
that
you
can't
trust
what
a
juror
says...
if
a
juror
says,
i
have
no
opinion
about
a
case...
is
disproven
by
the
kind
of
candor
he
shares--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--your
honor,
our
position
is
that
jurors...
i
think
the
law
is
well
established...
is
that
jurors
are
presumed
to
be
impartial
and
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
defense
to
demonstrate
partiality.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
one
of
the
things
that
they
must
do
is
demonstrate
some
reason
to...
why
the
trial
court
should
distrust
a
juror's
statement
about
whether
or
not
they
have
an
opinion
in
the
case,
and
that
simply
was
not
done
in
this
case.
the
amicus
brief
suggests
that
jurors
come
into
court
eager
to
please
the
trial
judge
and
eager
to
give
the
right
answer
and
seem
to
be
fair.
we
suggest
that
jurors
are
real
life
people
with
real
life
problems
of
their
own.
and
they're
called
into
court
at
cubstantial
inconvenience
and
with...
to
hear
a
grisly
murder
case
for
a
week
with
the
ultimate
wrenching
prospect
of
deciding
whether
an
individual
should
live
or
die.
they
don't
have
a
particular
incentive
to
sit
on
jury
duty.
their
practical
incentives
far
counterbalance
any
kind
of
inclination
they
have
to
give
some
answer
that
theoretically
the
trial
judge
suggests;
and
in
fact,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
the
trial
judge
didn't
suggest
that
he
wanted
the
jurors
to
say
they
could
be
impartial.
in
five
different
ways
he
gave
them
the
opportunity.
he
rephrased
the
question
and
gave
them
the
opportunity
to
say
that
they
could
judge
the
case
fairly...
they
could
not
judge
the
case
fairly.
and
as
soon
as
one
or
more
of
them
did,
he
excused
them
for
cause.
we
submit
that
the
adoption
of
this
rule
would
go
farther
than
this
court
gone
in
requiring
voir
dire
questions
in
the
past.
in
turner
v.
murray,
in
ham
v.
south
carolina,
where
this
court
has
required
specific
types
of
voir
dire
questions,
what
the
court
has
required
is
that
the
juror
be
confronted
with
a
possible
source
of
bias
and
asked
to
search
their
conscience
and
state
whether
they
would
be
subject
to
that
bias
or
not.
the
question
mandated
by
the
court
in
turner
was
the
defendant,
willy
lloyd
turner,
as
a
member
of
the
negro
race.
the
victim,
jack
smith,
was
a
white
caucasian.
will
these
facts
prejudice
you
against
willy
lloyd
turner
or
affect
your
ability
to
render
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
based
solely
on
the
evidence?
and
the
question
mandaeed...
the
questions
mandated
in
ham
v.
south
carolina
were
similar.
what
mu'min
wants
to
do
here
is
far
more
intrusive.
what
he
wants
to
do
is
search
the
juror's
memory
for
facts
and
then
dispute
the
juror's
statements
about
the
juror's
reaction
to
those
facts.
that
kind
of
intrusive
inquiry
has
never
been
required
by
this
court
and
we
submit
that
it
should
not
be.
the
effects
if
it
were
would
be
undesirable
on
the
american
jury
trial
system.
it
would
require
individual
voir
dire
in
one
method
or
another
in
every
case
to
prevent
other
jurors
from
being
exposed
to
this
information
that
one
juror
may
have
that
supposedly
would
be
contaminatory.
there
would
be
no
principled
way
to
restrict
the
inquiry
to
simply
cases
of
pretrial
publicity
as
justice
stevens'
question
i
think
brought
out
and
as
mu'min
conceded
at
trial,
the
same
logic
would
apply
in
other
situations.
in
death
penalty
qualification,
if
a
prosecutor
wants
to
probe
a
juror's
assurances
that
they
can
follow
the
law
and
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--it
may
be
something
that
the
trial
court
would
want
to
consider--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--in
deciding
whether
content
questioning
would
be
desireable
or
would
be
helpful
in
the
case.
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--certainly
the
trial
court
in
this
case
asked
the
jurors
if
they
received
information
about
the
case
from
the
news
media
or--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--the
trial
court
asked
if
the
juror
had
an
opinion
about
the
case.
and
that
is
a
crucial...
i
think
that
is
a
crucial
aspect
of
voir
dire...
is
determining
if
a
juror
has
an
opinion.
none
of
the
jurors
in
this
case
indicated
they
even
had
an
opinion
about
the
case,
much
less
an
opinion
that
they
could
set
aside...
that
they
could
not
set
aside
and
judge
the
case
on
law
and
the
evidence,
except
for
juror
syphrett
who
said
he
couldn't
be
fair
and
he
was
excused.
so
a
crucial
question
is
whether
the
juror
has
formed
an
opinion
about
the
case.
if
mu'min's
rule
is
adopted,
it
will
apply
to
death
penalty
qualification.
the
prosecutor
will
be
able
to
explore
the
content
of
a
juror's
religious
beliefs
about
capital
punishment
in
order
to
assess
their
veracity.
a
defense
attorney
in
examining
a
juror
whose
been
a
victim
of
a
crime
may
be
able
to
probe
the
juror...
the
content
of
the
juror's
memories
of
the
pain
and
fear
and
humiliation
of
their
own
crime
in
order
to
assess
their
ability
to
be
fair.
in
these
and
many
other--
mr.
john
h.
mclees,
jr.
--thank
you,
your
honor.
