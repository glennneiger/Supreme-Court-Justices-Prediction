justice
stevens
well,
why
is
there...
i
don't
understand
this
line
drawing.
it's
in...
i
thought
from
your
brief
all
you
asked
for
was
to
find
out
what
the...
what
the
jurors
know.
justice
stevens
it's
a
simple
line.
i
don't
know
why
you
even
went
with
it
through
a
case
of
massive
publicity.
if
a
juror
says
he's
heard
about
the
case,
your
position
is
he
ought
to
be
able
to
find
out
what
he's
heard
about
it--
justice
stevens
--whether
his
wife
wrote
a
letter
to
the
governor
about
it
or
whatever
it
was.
isn't
that
your
position?
you
just
want
to
know
what
the
jurors
know.
justice
stevens
well,
they
said
they
knew
something
about
it.
justice
stevens
yes,
but...
but
that
doesn't
really
cover
every
possible
source
of
information
that
might
have
been
available.
they
might
have
attended
a
meeting
of
the
american
legion
which
was
formulating
a
resolution
to
send
to
the
governor
to
improve
correction
practices.
and
that
might
be
where
they
heard
about
it.
justice
stevens
well,
then
that
might
put
a
little
different
cast
on
the
thing
or
they
might
have
seen
a
copy
of
the
letter
that
the
spouse
wrote
to
the
governor
protesting
this
outrage.
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
of
getting
information
other
than
just
what's
in
the
public
press.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
this
hypothetical.
supposing
during
the
trial
a
juror
came
to
the
judge
and
said,
there
was
some
material
about
the
case
in
the
jury
room
which
we
all
read,
but
we're
all
satisfied
we
can
still
be
impartial.
do
you
think
the
judge
would
have
any
duty
to
say,
what
was
the
material?
justice
stevens
a
constitutional
duty?
justice
stevens
and
how
is
that
case
different
from
this?
justice
stevens
there
is
no
other...
it
was
there
just
lying
on
the
table
when
they
got
there,
and
they
couldn't
help
but
see
it.
justice
stevens
well,
how
do
you
know
it's
more
immediate?
you
could...
it
may
be
that
at
breakfast
that
very
morning,
the
voir
dire...
the
venire
person
had
gotten
all
the
information.
justice
stevens
you
don't
even
know
that...
you
don't
know
whether
it
was
a
newspaper
a
month
ago
or
in
a
conversation
with
a
group
of
friends
the
very
day.
justice
stevens
well,
the
general
question...
do
you
know
anything
about
the
defendant
or
the
facts
of
the
case
would
bring
that
out,
and
then
you
say
what
do
you
know.
it's
a
very
routine
way
to
do
it.
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
it
would
help
the
trial
judge
to
know
what
they
had
read?
justice
stevens
maybe
he
doesn't
need
to,
but
you
don't
think
it
would
help
him
at
any...
you
don't
think
there's
a
distinction
between
the
wide
variety
of
ways
in
which
people
can
get
information
about
a
case
and
the
nature
of
the
information?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
overlooks
the
possibility
the
juror
may
really
believe
that
and
they
may
have
heard
exactly
as
justice
marshall
posits
that
my
neighbor
is
a...
works
for
the
police
department
and
he
told
my
wife
this
guy
is
definitely
guilty.
i
know
enough
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
that.
so...
and
this
is
his
own
thought
process,
and
i'll
say
i
can't.
but
if
you
heard
that
as
a
judge
you'd
probably
excuse
that
juror
even
though
he
sincerely
says
i
think
i
can
put
it
to
one
side.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
right.
well,
isn't
the
nature
of
bias
and
impartiality
often
the
fact
that
the
person
does
not
recognize
that
he
or
she
has
the
bias?
i
mean,
it's
not
just
active
animosity
toward
a
party
that
we're
interested
in.
but
it's...
are
those
assumptions
that
the
juror
is
not
maybe
even
sure
of...
that
he
holds
until
he's
examined
about
them
or
she's
examined
about
them
with
some
specificity.
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
stevens
all
that
you've
just
said
doesn't
become
true,
however,
any
more
if
the
publicity
is
more
recent
than
3
months.
now,
when
else
doesn't
it
become
true?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
make
any
difference
if
the
juror
had
been
in
the
store
and
seen
it,
but
didn't
think
that
would
affect
his
prejudice...
seen
what
happened?
justice
stevens
whether
or
not
the
juror
was
actually
a
witness.
justice
stevens
but
not...
you
don't
have
to...
you're
not
required
to
find
out
whether
he
saw
the
crime
committed.
justice
stevens
that
might
be
the
source
of
one
of
these
juror's
information
for
all
we
know.
might
have
been
in
the
store
and
watched
the
whole
thing
take
place,
but
i
can
be
fair
because
i
know
what
happened.
justice
stevens
they'd
say
yes,
they
did,
but
i
can--
