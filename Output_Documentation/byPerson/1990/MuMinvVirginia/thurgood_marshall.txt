justice
marshall
well,
counsel,
before
the...
what
about
a
question
like
this.
what
do
you
know
about
this
case
and
where
did
you
get
your
information
from,
to
each
juror?
justice
marshall
not...
not
those
words.
justice
marshall
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
he
said
it
had
gone
just
a
step
further.
justice
marshall
i
mean
suppose
somebody
told
this
juror
that
i
am
a
member
of
the
adriscatory
process
of
the
police
department
and
i
know
that
that
sucker
is
guilty.
shouldn't
the
judge
know
that?
and
my
question
would
get
that.
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
my
point...
would
you
object
to
that
phrase?
justice
marshall
well,
answer
it
the
way
i
suggested
it.
justice
marshall
don't
the...
doesn't
the
court
instruct
the
jury
that
you
can't
use
anything
except
what
you
hear
in
this
courtroom?
justice
marshall
doesn't
the
judge
instruct
the
jury
that
you
cannot
use
any
information
except
what
you
hear
in
this
courtroom?
justice
marshall
doesn't
he
do
that
every
time?
justice
marshall
well,
what's
the
difference
of
what
i
asked?
i
asked
what
did
you
learn
about
this
case
outside
of
this
courtroom.
