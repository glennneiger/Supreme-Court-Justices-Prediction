mr.
john
h.
blume
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
question
whether,
in
a
capital
case,
involving
pervasive,
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity,
which
a
majority
of
the
potential
jurors
have
been
exposed
to,
may
a
trial
judge
prohibit
any
inquiry
whatsoever
regarding
what
the
jurors
know.
in
answering
that
question,
the
pertinent
facts
in
mr.
mu'min's
case
need
to
be
briefly
reviewed.
he
was
charged
in
the
fall
of
1988
with
capital
murder.
at
that
time
he
was
serving
a
48-year
sentence
for
murder
in
the
virginia
department
of
corrections.
the
case
drew
substantial
press
attention
due
to
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
its
unusual
historical
context.
the
articles,
as
the
dissenting
justices
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
noted,
were
very
negative
in
their
tone
and
their
content.
they
included
reports
that
mr.
mu'min
had
confessed
to
the
murder;
that
a
rape
was
involved
in
this
crime;
the
details
of
his
1973
murder
conviction,
including
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
was
not
an
available
punishment
due
to
this
court's
decision
in
furman;
mr.
mu'min's
juvenile,
criminal,
prison
and
parole
records
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
bad
acts.
furthermore,
this
case
became
part
of
the
then
national
debate
about
the
laxity
of
the
correction
system.
there
were
articles
which
indicated
that
all
public
officials
associated
with
this
crime
should
be
fired
as
well
as
stories
comparing
mr.
mu'min's
offense
to
a
crime
committed
by
the
then
infamous
willy
horton,
and
other
crimes
committed
by
virginia
prisoners.
this
case
became
caught
up
in
the
themes
of
the
bush/dukakis
presidential
campaign.
politicians,
candidates,
and
public
officials,
including
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
used
it
as
an
example
of
all
that
was
wrong
with
the
criminal
justice
system.
then
governor
baliles
suspended
the
work
release
program
with
great
media
fanfare
as
a
result
of
this
offense.
the
then
virginia
department
of
transportation
secretary,
vivian
watt,
made
a
public
apology
to
the
victim's
family
and
to
the
citizens
of
the
county
as
a
result
of
this
crime.
as
a
result
of
this
media
coverage,
counsel
requested
that
certain
voir
dire
questions
be
asked
regarding
the
content
of
the
information
that
the
potential
jurors
had
been
exposed
to.
the
trial
judge,
however,
refused
to
ask
or
permit
any
questions
to
this
effect
and
only
allowed
several
short
questions
regarding
whether,
in
spite
of
the
media
accounts,
the
jurors
could
be
impartial.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
he
allowed
one
question
which
was,
have
you
read
anything
about
the
case.
then
he
allowed...
then
there
were
several
follow-up
questions
asked
which
are
specifically
set
forth
in
rule
14(a)
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
rules
which
were;
would
that
information
affect
your
impartiality,
followed
up
by,
do
you
believe
that
you
can
enter
the
jury
box
with
an
open
mind
and
wait
until
the
entire
case
is
presented
before
reaching
a
fixed
opinion
as
to
mr.
mu'min's
guilt
or
innocence,
and
then
he
essentially
asked
that
question...
the
same
question
again.
and
that
was
the
sole
thrust
of
the--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--what
counsel
sought
to
ask
were
several
questions
regarding
what
the
jurors
had
seen
about
the
case,
yes.
the
trial
judge
adhered
to
this
decision--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes,
they
are--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--in
the
joint
appendix
in
the
first
few
pages,
beginning
at
page--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--2
are
his
proposed
voir
dire
questions.
mr.
john
h.
blume
the
trial
judge
adhered
to
this
decision
despite
the
fact
that
when
the
jury
was
attempting
to
be
selected
that
16
of
the
20-some
original
panel
called
acknowledged
that
they
had
read
about
the
case.
in
fact,
8
of
12
jurors
who
ultimately
convicted
mr.
mu'min
of
murder
and
sentenced
him
to
death
had
read
stories
in
the
press,
although
we
have
no
idea
what
they
had
read.
mr.
john
h.
blume
what...
which
ones
had
read
about
the
case?
mr.
john
h.
blume
no,
the
judge
said--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
the
judge
said,
has
anyone
acquired
any
information
about
the
account...
about
the
case
to
the
news
accounts?
the
jurors
raised
their
hand.
they
noted
who
they
were,
and
then
he
asked
these
several
follow-up
questions,
so
you
had
an
idea
of
who
it
was
based
upon
that.
it's
in
the
transcript...
the
record.
it's
also
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
your
honor.
the
motion
was
made
several
times.
it
was
made
pretrial.
the
judge
said
it's
premature.
that
was
when
a
number
of
these
articles
were
brought
to
his
attention.
the
judge
denied
the
motion,
said
we'll
wait
and
see
what
happens
during
the
jury
selection
process.
however,
he
also
made
several
remarks
there
which
i
think
are
factors
that
need
to
be
considered.
he
said
that
it's
my
opinion
if
you
can
get
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
in
this
county...
i've
heard
it
said,
you
know,
that
with
approval,
you
can
get
an
impartial
jury
here
for
anything
if
you
want
to.
and
made
several
remarks
like
that.
then
there
was...
during
the
jury
selection
process...
the
jurors
indicated
that
they
had...
these
jurors
indicated
that
they
had
read
about
the
case.
counsel
moved
to
ask
the
questions.
that
was
denied.
he
then
asked
that
all
the
jurors
who
had
read
about
the
case
be
excused
for
cause.
he
then
renewed
his
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no.
mr.
mu'min
does
not
contend
that
this
is
a
irvin
v.
dowd
presumed
prejudice
case.
i
think
the
rule
mr.
mu'min
seeks
is
really
more
modest
than
that.
this
court
has
essentially
gone
further
than
needs
to
be
gone
here
and
has
adopted
a
rule,
as
in
irvin,
that
under
some
circumstances
a
trial...
a
juror's
assertions
of
impartiality
can
be,
and
in
fact
must
be,
disregarded.
mr.
john
h.
blume
there...
well,
the
significant
thing
about
those
cases
i
believe
is...
in
patton
v.
yount
i
think
supports
mr.
mu'min's
contention.
the
presumption--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--no,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
really
believe
that's
the
rule
that
we
seek.
let
me
say
this
about
patton.
the
court
gave
the
finding
of
impartiality...
the
presumption
of
correctness
in
patton...
and
explicitly
said
this.
we
do
so
because
the
trial
judge
allowed
a
searching
voir
dire
which
was
specifically
designed
to
elicit
juror
bias
as
a
result
of
the
publicity.
that
simply
did
not
happen
here.
this
court
has
acknowledged
in
other
cases
that
without
an
adequate
voir
dire,
the
judge's
findings
of
impartiality
cannot...
should
be
afforded
due
deference.
mr.
john
h.
blume
there
is
no
question
that
this
court's
supervisory
power
over
federal
court
proceedings
is
broader.
but
nevertheless,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
applies
in
state
court
criminal
proceedings.
and
it
must--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--he
essentially...
i
think
that
the
fair
reading
of
what
happened
is
he
took
their
silence
on
faith.
the
jurors
could
have
been
found
to
be
impartial
here
by
totally
remaining
silent.
all
they
had
to
do
was
not
respond
to
the
questions
about
regarding
whether
you
could
be
fair
and
impartial.
they
didn't
have
to
say
a
word.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no,
mr.
mu'min
is
not
here
seeking
individual
sequestered
voir
dire.
however,
i
think
if
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
is
to
mean
anything,
it
must
mean
that
when
the
publicity,
taken
as
a
whole,
poses
a
constitutionally
significant
risk
that
the
jurors
may
have
been
influenced
by
prejudicial,
extraneous
information,
may
have
formed
an
opinion
about
the
case,
or
be
otherwise
biased
or
partial
as
to
guilt,
or
in
a
capital
case,
as
to
either
guilt
or
the
appropriate
punishment,
and
one
or
more
jurors
have
been
exposed
to
that
information,
then
some
reasonable
inquiry
must
be
made.
i
think
more
concretely
in
a
case
such
as
mr.
mu'min's
where
the
publicity
contains
information
which
is
inadmissible
or
inaccurate,
which
is
material,
and
which
is
likely
to
mislead
or
inflame
the
jury
as
to
guilt
or
punishment,
some
inquiry
must
be
permitted
as
to
what
the
jurors
know.
again,
this
is
a
more
modest
rule
than
what
has
already
been
adopted
by
this
court
in
irvin,
which
is
that
sometimes
jurors'
assertions
of
impartiality
must
be
disbelieved.
it
involves
a
narrower...
a
narrower
procedural
rule
than
that
adopted
in
irvir
but
is
nevertheless
necessary
to
its
implementation,
because
under
some
circumstances,
as
this
court
has
acknowledged,
pretrial
publicity
can
impinge
upon
a
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
this
court
has
also
acknowledged
that
a
defendant's
protection
against
that
infringement...
his
protection
against
the
effects
of
negative
pretrial
publicity
is
his
ability
to
demonstrate
actual
juror
bias.
without
some
fair
opportunity
of
finding
out
in
a
case
such
as
this
what
the
jurors
know,
that
right
simply
cannot
be
honored.
mr.
john
h.
blume
there's
certainly
no
question
that
any
defense
lawyer
would
want
to
know
this
for
peremptories,
but
that
is
not
the
thrust
of
the
concern.
the
concern
is
without
this
information,
the
trial
judge
simply
cannot
fairly
evaluate
the
jurors'
assertions
of
impartiality.
i
think
in--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
it
would
be...
there
would
be
a
number
of
things.
one,
it
would
give
the
judge
a
basis
to
determine
the
jurors'
assertions
of
impartiolity.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
would
be
whether
the
juror
was
qualified
to
serve...
or
if
he
would
be
excused
for
cause.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
several
things
could
come
out.
one,
a
judge
would
have
something
to
evaluate
it
against.
it
is...
it
seems
to
me
the
essence
of
a
judge's
duty
to
apply
the
law
to
the
relevant
facts.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no,
i
don't
think
mr.
mu'min's
position
here...
it's
actually
only
4
or
5
that
had
to
do
with
the
media...
depends
on
any
one
particular
question.
those
questions
or
some
reasonable
substitutes
needed
to
be
asked.
they
didn't
need
to
be
asked
by
counsel--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--there
were
3
or
4,
i
think,
in
the
record
that
he
sought
to
ask
which
were
denied
which
had
to
do
with
that
particular
fact.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
that's
the
entire
list
that
he
submitted...
that
he
submitted
in
the
case.
it's
only
several,
which
i
believe
are
on
page
4
and
5.
there
are
several
questions
at
the
bottom
of
4
and
the
top
of
5
which
are
relevant
to
this.
mr.
john
h.
blume
one
of
the
numbers
was.
mr.
john
h.
blume
he
really
only
went
into
it
one
time.
there
were
a
couple
panels
that
were
brought
in
where
they
weren't
sure
whether
those
people
had
been
asked.
they
weren't
part
of
the
original
panel,
so
as
new
people
were
brought
in,
they
were
then
asked
the
same
question.
so
it
wasn't
the
same
people
being
questioned
over
and
over
about
it.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
justice
scalia,
let
me
give
a
few
concrete
examples--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--of
what
i
think
would
happen
in
a
case.
mr.
john
h.
blume
a
potential
juror
called,
what
have
you
seen
about
the
case...
what
have
you
read
about
the
case?
well,
i
read
that
mr.
mu'min
has
a
long
prior
record.
would
you
be
able
to
put
that
out
of
your
mind?
no.
well,
that
juror...
no
judge
would
agree
to
that
juror's
qualified.
another
example--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--because
i
think
that
due
to
the
nature
of
the
prejudicial
information,
the
way
pretrial
publicity
prejudices
someone...
it's
important
to
understand
what
they
know.
a
juror
may
or
may
not
know,
for
example,
that
they're
not
supposed
to
consider
an
individual's
prior
criminal
record.
the
straight
question,
would
this
affect
your
decision?
without
knowing
it,
they
don't
know
the
legal
standard.
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
contexts
that
the
juror
cannot
be
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
their
own
impartiality.
they
do
not
know
the
correct
legal
standard.
it's...
the
court
has
also
recognized
and
i
think
it's
true
that
jurors...
it's
difficult
to
determine
juror
bias,
because
they
may
not
want
to
reveal
it
or
they've--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--also
may
not
know
it.
mr.
john
h.
blume
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
the
term
individual--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i'm
sorry,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
the
term
individual
sequestered
voir
dire
suggests
an
elaborateness
of
procedure
that
is
not
necessary.
there
are
a
number
of
ways
you
could
have
done
this
and
of
course
that
would
be
free
to
the
states
to
determine
how
to
implement
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
ways
you
can
do
it.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i...
yes.
i
don't
know
that
you
necessarily
would.
let
me
give
you
a
way
in
which
we
do
other
things
in
criminal
courts
which
might
be
relevant.
often
potential
jurors
are
asked,
have
you
ever
been
a
victim
of
a
crime.
rather
than
take
everyone
out
and
individually
sequester
the
juror,
that
person
is
asked
to
come
to
the
bench
and
then
the
lawyers
and
the
judge
talk
briefly
at
the
bench
and
you
find
it
out.
that's
a
procedure
that
could
be
used.
questionnaires
is
possibly
another
way
to
elicit
what
they
know.
the
point
is
that
this
does
not
lead
inevitably
to
individual
sequestered
voir
dire.
the
states,
you
know,
some
states
may
decide
to
go
that
way,
as
they
done
with
turner.
this
court's
decision
in
turner...
they've
developed
different
ways
to
try
and
implement
that
constitutional
right.
the
fact
that
they...
that
it
may
require
some
follow-up
of
it
does
not
mean
that
the
opposite
conclusion
should
be
drawn
and
that
nothing
should
be
allowed
to
be
done.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
that,
you
know,
may
or
may
not
happen,
depending
on
what
an
individual
juror
says.
but
that's
the
kind
of--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--that
is
another
phenomenon
which
this
court
has
recognized
and
which
is
documented
in
the
literature.
mr.
john
h.
blume
then
the
judge
would
one...
he
would
have
a
number
of
facts
against
which
to
judge
the
juror's
assertions
of
impartiality
and,
two,
the
juror
may
change
their
mind.
but
if
the
judge
heard
all
that,
found
the
juror
to
be
impartial,
then
that
finding
would
be
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
correctness,
that
it
would
be
made
on
the
basis
of
an
adequate
voir
dire.
without
it...
with
the
procedures
utilized
in
this
case,
essentially
the
judge
had
to
accept
what
the
jurors
said
about
their
own
impartiality
on
faith.
but
again,
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
that
jurors
cannot
be
the
final
ultimate
arbiters
of
their
own
impartiality.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
but
then
the
judge
has
some
facts,
come...
against
which
to
apply
the
legal
criteria.
i
think
the...
an
analogy
might
be
a
suppression
hearing.
i
don't
think
that
anybody
would
reasonably
say
that
all...
a
lawyer
can
ask
a
police
officer
at
a
suppression
hearing
is,
was
the
confession
that
you
took
from
my
client
free
and
voluntary?
you're
entitled
to
get
some
information
out.
that
is
the
essence
of
a
judge's
duty,
to
apply
law
to
facts.
without
that,
there
is
no
way
to
have
any
idea
what
the
jurors
know.
mr.
john
h.
blume
first,
in
this
record
we
have
affirmative
evidence
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
believe
that.
he
said
affirmatively
in
the
record,
that
i
think
the
media
believe
their
stories
are
more
widely
read
than
they
in
fact
are.
so
we
know
in
this
record
that
is
not
what
the
judge
thought.
mr.
john
h.
blume
however,
even
then,
assuming
that
the...
you
still
would
not
have
any
way
in
which
the
juror
talked
about
the
information...
that
demeanor
of
evidence
is
relevant
in
this.
in
fact,
in
this
case
on
a
less
relevant
issue,
the
judge
excused
a
juror
who
said
they
were
opposed
to
the
islamic
faith,
because
he
didn't
like
the
way
they
said
it.
that's
the
type
of
things
judges
do,
but
they
do
it
by
hearing
at
least
a
little
bit
about
what
the
jurors
know.
and
in
this
context,
in
this
type
of
prejudicial
pretrial
information,
some
idea
of
what
the
jurors
know
is
necessary.
it's
a--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--no,
i'm
saying
this
particular
judge
said
that,
so
we
know
that
he
didn't
think--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
we
know
that
he
didn't
do
it
here.
but
assuming
a
judge
did--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
seems
to
me
he--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--and
that
he
said--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--he
might
do
that,
but
again
then
you
still
would
not
have
any
idea
of
what...
how
a
particular
juror
reacted
to
that.
if
you
knew
the
jurors
knew
all
that,
for
example,
then
it
seems
to
me
a
defendant
would
still
be
entitled
to
know
how
they
reacted
to
it.
let's
go
to
another
example
which
would
arise
out
of
the
type
of
publicity
in
this
case.
the
prosecutor
in
the
1973
case
made
statements
to
the
press,
which
were
reported,
that
mr.
mu'min
got
a
48-year
sentence
in
'73
because
the
death
penalty
was
not
available.
let's
assume
a
juror
knew
that.
a
fair
question
would
seem
to
me
to
be,
well,
can
you
put
that
out
of
your
mind
when
you're
determining
mr.
mu'min's
punishment?
a
juror
may
say,
no,
i
feel...
that
would
be
tough
for
me.
i
feel
like
he
beat
the
death
penalty
on
a
legal
technicality
in
'73
and
should
be
sentenced
to
death
now.
that
would
be
possibly
a
logical
follow-up
to
having
some
idea
of
what
the
jurors
know.
this
is
a
different
type
bias
than
race
bias,
than
the
race
bias
identified
in
turner
which
is
a
more
generic
type
bias
which
is
easy
to
focus
a
juror's
attention
on.
the
bias
that
results
from
pretrial
publicity
is
necessarily
more
fact
specific.
it
depends
on
what
the
media
accounts
say.
and
this
court
has
acknowledged
that.
it
said
that
the
extent
and
the
tone
of
publicity
can
affect
a
juror's
ability
to
be
impartial.
so
you
have
to
have
some
fair
opportunity
in
a
case
with
this
pervasiveness
of
publicity
to...
to
at
least
find
out
what
the
jurors
know
and
then
to
find
out
how
that
might
affect
them.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
there
are
several
reasons--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
there
are
several
reasons,
justice
o'connor,
that
that's
true.
first,
i
think
what
the
court
said
in
turner
was
that
the
nature
of
the
racial
bias
of
that
case
would
not
have
affected
the
guilt/innocence
determination.
that
is
necessarily
different,
i
think,
than
the
type
of
information
that
was
involved
in
this
case
which
contained
a
number
of
facts
which
are
not
admitted
at
the
guilt
or
innocence
phase
of
this
trial.
and
essentially
what
the
court
said
in
turner,
as
i
understand
it,
was
not
that
the
error
was
harmless
as
to
mr.
turner's
guilt,
but
that
there
was
no
sixth
amendment
violation
as
to
his
guilt.
i
don't
think
you
can
draw
that
same
conclusion
from
the
type
of
publicity
in
this
case.
but
nevertheless,
drawing
upon
turner,
the
violation
in
this
case
certainly
cannot
be
harmless,
assuming
harmless
error
applies
at
the
sentencing
phase.
mr.
john
h.
blume
the
rule,
as
i
tried
to
formulate
it,
was
that
if
the
publicity
taken
as
a
whole
poses
a
constitutionally
significant
risk
that
the
jurors
may
have
been
influenced
by
prejudicial,
extraneous
information,
may
have
formed
an
opinion
about
the
case,
or
may
be
otherwise
biased
or
partial
as
to
guilt,
or
in
a
capital
case,
as
to
guilt
or
punishment,
and
one
or
more
jurors
have
read
about
the
information,
then
some
reasonable
inquires
must
be
permitted.
that's
simply
in--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--the
judge
would
be
fine.
mr.
mu'min
was
not
seeking
the
counsel
to
ask
the
questions
himself.
if
the
judge
had
asked
these
questions,
that
would
have
been
fine.
some
states
the
judge
does
voir
dire
and
some
states
the
lawyers
do
it.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
first
of
whether
it
would
give
the
judge
a
basis.
he
again
is
the
one
who
ultimately
decide
whether
the
juror
is
partial
or
not,
and
he
has
to
have
some
facts.
i
think
certainly
it
would
help
for
a
review
in
court
to
have
the
information
to
know
what
the
jurors
knew
and
to
be
able
to
evaluate
their
assertions
of
impartiality
against
that
standard.
it
is,
i
admit,
an
area
of
line
drawing,
but
nevertheless,
as
in
many
other
areas,
even
in
the
race
cases,
ristaino
v.
ross,
rosales-lopez
v.
the
united
states,
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
in
cases
involving
interracial
crimes,
lines
have
to
be
drawn.
i
think
it
would
certainly
be
the
same
here.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
opposite
line
should
be
drawn
and
say
that
we're
never
going
to
allow
people
to
know
what
jurors
know.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
that--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes,
i
think
under
some
circumstances
if
you
can
show
that
something
about
the
information--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes,
i
think
if
you
can
show,
though,
the
points...
i
think
that
if
you
can
show
that
there's
something
prejudicial
about
the
information
that
the
juror
might
know,
you
would
need
to
know,
you
know,
what
that
is.
without
it,
the
judge
simply
cannot
determine
whether
a
juror
is
impartial.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
certainly
this
court
has
recognized
that,
that
the
trial
judge
has
an
affirmative
constitutional
duty
under
the
due
process
clause
in
the
sixth
amendment
to
ensure
the
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
and
that
under
some
circumstances
that
will
require
an
adequate
voir
dire.
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
numerous
cases.
in
a
way
i
think
this
is
the
flip
side
of
the
freedom--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
difference
that
can
be
drawn
from
this
court's
decisions
about
the
particular
ways
in
which
pervasive,
prejudicial
publicity
can
affect
a
juror's
determination.
that
is
a
distinction
this
court
has
drawn
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
reasonable
one...
that
jurors
are
likely
to
be
influenced
by
what
they
read
about
the
case.
in
a
way--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it...
you
know,
you
would
need
to
know
the
facts
of
the
case.
how
it
related
to
it,
and
it
may
make
a
difference.
but
the
point
here
i
think
is
again
this
court
specifically
recognized--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--that's
true,
but
i
do
think
that
from
a
constitutional
vantage
point,
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
decisions
that
pervasive,
prejudicial
publicity
has
a...
can
affect
a
juror's
ability
to
serve
in
a
unique
way.
and--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
those...
excuse
me...
those
questions
were
permitted
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
blume
there
may
be
other
circumstances
which
entitle
constitutionally
a
defendant
to
ask
certain
questions.
i
mean
it
may
be...
and
that
may
be
one
of
them.
but
i
do
think
that
a
reasonable
line
which
this
court
has
already
drawn
in
numerous
cases
is
that
publicity
may
affect
jurors
in
unique
ways.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
reasonable
one.
in
a
way,
this
is
the
flip
side
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
cases.
i
mean
this
court
and
numerous
state
and
federal
courts
have
over
the
last
years
recognized
and...
the
right
of
the
press
to
cover
criminal
cases.
and
they've
invalidated
a
number
of
measures
which
restrict
press
access
to
those
cases.
the
court
has
also
noted
the
increasing
frequency
with
which
the
press
covers
criminal
cases.
however,
if
that's
true,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
also
necessarily
true
that
in
order
to
protect
a
defendant's
right,
especially
a
capital
defendant's
right...
someone
whose
life
is
at
stake...
his
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury...
there
are
some
circumstances
such
as
the
one
in
mr.
mu'min's
case
which
you're
entitled
to
have...
find
out
what
it
is
the
jurors
know.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
is
an
explanation,
justice
scalia.
but
i
do
think
this
court's
decisions
also
bring
that
principle
into
play,
that
due
to
the
frequency
with
which
the
press
reports
things
and
the
freedom
that
this
court
has
given
in
the
coverage
of
criminal
trials,
and
this
court
has
specifically
recognized
that
in
gannett
company,
nebraska
press
and
numerous
other
decisions
that
a
defendant
has
to
have
a
right
to
find
out...
i
mean
to
test
the
juror's
ability
to
serve.
