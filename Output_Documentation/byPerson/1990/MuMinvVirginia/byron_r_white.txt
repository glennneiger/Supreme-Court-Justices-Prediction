justice
white
are
there
questions
that...
that
counsel
proposed
to
be
asked
in
the
record?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--all
right.
justice
white
fine.
justice
white
was
there
a
motion
to
change
venue
in
this
case?
justice
white
do
you
think
that...
is
part
of
your
claim
that
the
publicity
was
so
pervasive
that
bias
should
automatically
be
presumed?
justice
white
well,
well,
and
there
wasn't...
there
wouldn't
be
anything
you
could
do
about
it
under...
in
a
federal
court
if
they
just
stayed
silent.
you
wouldn't
say,
i
insist
on
individual
voir
dire
of
every
single
member
of
the
venire.
justice
white
can
you...
do
you
suggest
at
all
of
these
58
or
more
questions
have
anything
to
do
with
publicity?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
argument...
how
many
of
these
questions
have
to
do
with
the
fundamental
issue
about
whether
or
not
a
juror
might
be
biased
because
of
publicity?
justice
white
well,
you...
this
list
is
headed
up,
petitioner's
proposed
voir
dire
questions.
justice
white
suppose
that
the
judge
had
granted
these
questions
32
through
41,
have
you
heard
anything...
where
did
you
get
it?
have
you
heard
any
opinions
about
the
case
and
so
on?
and
your
final...
41,
you
say,
can
you
disregard
anything
that
might
have
been
said
and
try
this
case
on
the
law
and
the
evidence
you
hear
in
this
courtroom?
now...
and
the
juror
says,
yes.
and
i
suppose
you
can
say,
in
order
to
get
him
off,
if
you
don't...
you
just
have
to
say
you
don't
believe
him.
and
you
ask
the
judge
not
to
believe
him.
justice
white
well,
i
know
but...
but
to
get
him...
unless
you're
going
to
challenge...
unless
you're
going
to...
well,
i
suppose
it
is...
be
possible
that
after
the
juror
is...
is...
answers
these
questions,
he
may
say
he...
no,
i
am
biased.
justice
white
but
if
he
says...
the
juror
says,
no,
i
can
try
the
case
fairly--
justice
white
not
only
that,
but
if
he's
heard
about
it
from
any
person.
justice
white
well,
the
question
was
asked,
have
you
heard
about
it
from
any
other
persons?
justice
white
i
know,
but
he
wouldn't
let
them
to
inquire
specifically
what
they
had
read
or
seen?
justice
white
he
cut
that
off.
justice
white
especially,
he
didn't
want...
he
didn't
want
anybody
asking
what
the...
what
the
juror
had
heard
from
his
or
her
spouse.
justice
white
how
far
do
you
allow
him
to
go
in
that...
when
they
said,
yes,
we
have
discussed
it
with
somebody?
justice
white
is
she
the
one
who
had
a
paper
to
get
out?
