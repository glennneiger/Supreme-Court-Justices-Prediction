justice
scalia
mr.
blume,
what
i
don't
see
about
those
questions...
i
mean,
you
know,
what
have
you...
the
judge...
it's
on
pages
i
guess
about
47
and
on...
of
48
and
on
of
the...
of
the
appendix...
joint
appendix.
the
judge
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
making
sure
that
the
jurors
understood
that
whatever
they
had
heard,
they
were
not
to
take
into
account,
and
asking
them
whether
they
could
impartially
decide
the
case
despite
that.
and
one
of
the
members
of
the
venire
was
excused
on
that
basis,
because
he--
justice
scalia
--and
he
asked
the
question
more
than
once.
he
asked
it
several
times,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
i
see
him
as
being
rather
persistent
about
it.
he
says,
i'll
read
it...
i'll
repeat
it
in
a
different
fashion.
he
goes
into
it
several
ways.
now,
explain
to
me
how
it
would
help
being
sure
that
they
weren't
just
feigning
about
being
able
to
be
impartial.
how
would
it
have
helped
to
have
asked
the
particular
questions
that
you
wanted
asked
such
as,
what
have
you
seen,
read,
or
heard
about
this
case?
i
mean
they
admit
that
they've
seen,
read,
and
heard
stuff.
why
would
it
help
to
know
what
it
is
that
they've
seen?
why
would
that
help
you
to
determine
whether
they
could
be
impartial?
justice
scalia
now,
that
i'd
like.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
why
would
he
answer
no
to
that
question,
but
answer
yes
to
the
more
general
question,
has
anything
that
you've
heard
or
read
about
the
case
so
made
up
your
mind
that
you
couldn't
put
it
out
of
your
mind?
justice
scalia
mr.
blume,
one
can
presume
facts.
now,
you're
arguing
this
doesn't
have
to
be
done
in
all
cases,
but
just
when
there's
been
a
lot
of
pretrial
publicity.
and
i
assume
this
judge
knew
of
the
pretrial
publicity.
he'd
been
advised
of
it.
why
couldn't
he
say
to
himself,
i
will
assume
that
all
of
these
jurors
know
all
of
that
pretrial
publicity.
and
even
if
each
one
came
up
and
said
to
me,
i
read...
you
know,
it's
a
small
town...
it's
a
local
newspaper...
i
read
every
one
of
those
articles.
even
if
they
knew
all
of
it,
i
would
still
accept
their
word.
now,
why...
couldn't
you
say
that?
justice
scalia
un-huh.
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
first
point.
why
is
it
that
the
judge's
assumption
that
the
media
think
that
more
people
read
them
than
do...
why
does
that
preclude
his
having
made
this
decision
on
the
assumption
that
everybody
read
everything?
justice
scalia
he
didn't
believe
everybody
in
fact
read
everything,
but
he
could
have
made
his
judgment
as
to
whether
he
would
believe
their
assertion
of
impartiality
on
the
assumption
that
they
had
all
read
everything.
could
he
make
that
assumption?
justice
scalia
well,
wait...
why
do
we
know
he
didn't
do
it
here?
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
scalia
because
he
doesn't
believe...
because
he
thinks
the
media
think
that
they
are
more
widely
read
than
they
in
fact
are.
justice
scalia
i'm
saying
that
he
assumed
it,
not...
for
purposes
of
his
judgment...
not
that
he
believed
it
was
true,
but
for
purposes
of
whether
he
would
believe
the
jury,
he
assumed
that
they
had
read
all
of
the
pretrial
publicity.
couldn't
he
do
that?
justice
scalia
you
say
under
some
circumstances
or
as
justice
stevens
says,
under
all
circumstances?
i
thought
you
were
agreeing
with
him.
now
he's
saying
under
all
circumstances...
that
you
always
have
a
right
to
know
what
all
jurors
know.
so
in
every
case--
justice
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow.
i
mean
the
reason
we
may
be
concerned...
might
not
the
reason
we're
concerned
be
that
excessive
publicity
will
cause
numerous
people
like
mr.
syphrett,
in
this
case,
to
have
to
eliminate
himself
from
the
venire,
who
otherwise
wouldn't
be
eliminated.
isn't
that
a
good
explanation?
justice
scalia
only
sometimes...
i...
as
a
constitutional
rule.
i
was
disappointed
to
hear
your
response
to
justice
o'connor,
because
i
had...
i
had
thought
that
one
of
the
advantages
of
your
position...
perhaps
the
only
advantage...
was
that
it
doesn't
get
us
into
the
very
difficult
line
drawing
questions
that
some
of
the
colloquy
with
mr.
blume
was
bringing
out.
but
now
you
tell
me
we're
into
that
anyway.
justice
scalia
sometimes
we're
going
to
have
to
say
the
constitution
does
require
it.
justice
scalia
but
there
is
such
a
line?
there
is
one
but
we
can't
draw
it.
justice
scalia
then
the
constitution
never
requires
it.
it's
always
discretionary.
justice
scalia
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
other...
in
what
other
cases
virginia
has
to
individually
question
the
jurors
in
isolation
from
the
others.
you
say
if
it's
very
recent
publicity,
the
court
would
have
had
to
do
it.
justice
scalia
no?
i
thought
that's
what
you
said.
--the
recency
of
the
publicity
if
one
of
many
factors
that
the
court
should
consider.
and
must
consider
under
the
constitution,
right?
justice
scalia
so
we're
just
going
to
have
to
look
at
it
case
by
case
and
decide
whether
the
constitution
requires
it
or
not?
justice
scalia
and
reviewing
courts
will
review
them
on
constitutional
grounds.
what
other
factors?
how
recent
the
publicity
was.
what
else
is
there?
justice
scalia
i
agree
that
the
judge
who's
conducting
the
trial
should
consider
all
those
things
in
his
discretion,
but
as
i
understand
your
argument,
a
reviewing
court
should
consider
all
those
things
in
deciding
whether
the
constitution
has
been
violated
by
not
conducting
individual
interrogation.
justice
scalia
that's
the
position
you
want
us
to
enunciate.
