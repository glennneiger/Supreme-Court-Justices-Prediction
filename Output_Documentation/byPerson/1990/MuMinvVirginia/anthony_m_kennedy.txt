justice
kennedy
was
that
disclosed
by
interviewing
the
jurors
after
the
trial?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
this
is
just
based
on
what
was...
what
were
the
responses
to
the
questions
asked
by
the
judge
on
voir
dire?
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
general
rule
that
you're
proposing
for
our
adoption...
that
in
every
case
where
there
is
the
potential
of
prejudicial
publicity,
there
must
be
a
sufficient
voir
dire
to
enable
attorneys
to
make
a
motion
to
excuse
for
cause?
justice
kennedy
some...
wait
a
minute...
some
reasonable
inquires
must
be
permitted...
by
the
judge?
justice
kennedy
and
how
do
you
assess
reasonableness...
by
whether
or
not
it
would
give
a
review
in
court
or
counsel
in
the
case
an
adequate
basis
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
cause
for
excusal?
justice
kennedy
--well,
suppose...
suppose
the
court
said
that
he's
not
going
allow
any
inquiries
as
to
whether
or
not
jurors
have
relatives
in
law
enforcement.
and
you
were
very
concerned
because
it
was
a
small
community
and
there
was
a
danger
there
might
be
a
connection
with
law
enforcement.
now,
would
you
accept
that
as
a
reasonable
ruling
by
the
trial
court?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
question
is...
the
question
is
why
should
it
just
be
limited
to
pretrial
publicity?
there
are
any
number
of
disqualifications...
disqualifying
reasons
not
to
sit
a
juror.
justice
kennedy
more
so
than
by
being
related
to
a
witness
or
to
someone
whose
engaged
in
the
prosecution
of
the
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
assuming
that
they
weren't
in
order
to
test
the
standard
that
you're
proposing
for
our
adoption.
justice
kennedy
well,
what's
the
more
general
rule
that
you
proceed
from?
do
you
acknowledge
that
every
trial
judge
has
a
duty
to
make
inquiry
with
respect
to
the
juror's
impartiality?
justice
kennedy
all
right,
and
i
take
it
that
inquiry
should
be
of
reasonable
scope
to
disclose
likely
areas
of
partiality.
justice
kennedy
you
would
agree
with
that
rule?
justice
kennedy
all
right,
well,
if
that's
true...
if
publicity
is
a
particular
problem
in
a
particular
case,
then
i
assume
that
some
questions
must
be
directed
toward
publicity
under
your
view?
justice
kennedy
so
all
that
we're
arguing
about
in
this
case
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
inquiry
that
was
made?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'll
assume
petitioner's
counselor
will
say
content
questions
are
just
one
tool.
he
should
have
done
something
more
than
what
he
did,
and
i
offer
content
questions.
if
you
have
some
alternative,
maybe
that's
fine.
i
suppose
that's
what
he's
going
to
tell
us
on
rebuttal.
justice
kennedy
which
indicates
that
some
specific
questions
are
helpful
to
the
fact
finder.
justice
kennedy
could
you
answer
a
few
brief
questions
about
virginia
procedure?
is
it
either
the
practice
or
permitted
by
statute
to
inquire
of
the
jurors
after
the
trial
was
over
as
to
sources
of
bias?
were
the
jurors
in
this
case
questioned
by
counsel?
justice
kennedy
was
anything
offered
in
postconviction
proceedings
to
show
that
they
had
been
questioned?
justice
kennedy
there
have
been
no...
there
have
been
no
postconvictions?
justice
kennedy
and
the
other
question
i
have
is...
does
the
trial
court
always
ask
the
questions?
justice
kennedy
to
ask
the
questions
directly...
not
just
to
submit
the
questions?
justice
kennedy
thank
you.
