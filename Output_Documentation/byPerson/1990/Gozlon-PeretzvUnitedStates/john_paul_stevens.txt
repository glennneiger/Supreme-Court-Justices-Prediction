--let
me
just...
may
i
ask
you
one
question
to
make
sure
i've
got
this
sorted
out?
justice
stevens
i
mean
i
don't
begin
to
have
it
sorted
out,
but
the
thrust
in
your
argument
is
always
focusing
on
supervised
release.
but
if
you
are
correct,
are
you
also
arguing
that
section
1002
and
section
1003
simply
did
not
go
into
effect
at
all
until
november
1st?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
if
you
carry
the
day
on
the
supervised
release
you
must
be
saying
that
section
1002
is
not...
was
not
effective
until
november
1,
1987?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
earlier
you
made
a...
one
of
your
arguments
was
that
if
we
decide
in
your
favor
in
this
case,
we'll
avoid
a
whole
bunch
of
other
cases.
it
seems
to
me
if
we
accept
your
view
under...
on
supervised
release,
we're
next
have...
going
to
have
to
decide
what
the
rest
of
1002
means
and
what
1003
means,
whether
that
went
into
effect
in
november
1st
or
not.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that--
justice
stevens
--that
would
also
apply
to
1003
i
suppose,
wouldn't
it,
insofar
as
to
rely
on
1004
as
setting
forth
the
date
and
the
whole
scheme
fits
together
and
so
forth?
justice
stevens
we
save
those
for
another
case.
justice
stevens
well,
that's--
justice
stevens
--that's
just
saying
one
statute
was
totally
superfluous.
that's
not
inconsistency.
am
i
right?
and
as
they
abolish...
they
abolished
parole
effective
november
1,
'87
in
two
different
ways
but
totally
consistent
with
one
another.
justice
stevens
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
right.
they
didn't
need
to
do
it
again.
justice
stevens
but
they
didn't
do
anything
inconsistent.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
it
doesn't
create
any
administrative
anomalies
or
anything
like
that.
it
just
says
they
unnecessarily
did
something...
they
unnecessarily
abolished
parole
in
two
different
statutes
at
the
precisely
the
same
consequence.
justice
stevens
which
might
be
wise
legislation
in
some
circumstances
to
make
a
hundred
percent
sure
their
meaning
is
clear.
justice
stevens
well,
they're
not
saying
they
wanted
to
delay
it.
they're
saying
that
they
had
previously
delayed
supervisory
release
in
the
earlier
statute
and
all
they've
done
is
said
that
this
statute
shall
take
effect
at
the
same
time
as
other
supervised-release
provisions
take...
i
don't
see
the
inconsistency
in
it.
surely
they
could
have
drafted
it
better,
but--
justice
stevens
ms.
wax,
will
you...
i
should
know
this,
but
what
sentence
did
this
man
get?
justice
stevens
assume
you
win,
what...
how
long
will
he
be
in
prison?
justice
stevens
15
years
plus
a
10...
4
or
5
years.
