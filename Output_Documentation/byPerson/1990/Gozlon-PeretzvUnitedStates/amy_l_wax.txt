ms.
amy
l.
wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
try
to
summarize
this
case
in
four
basic
points.
it
is
virtually
an
unimpeachable
principle
of
legislation
and
one
on
which
congress
relies
every
time
it
enacts
a
statute
that
a
statute
goes
into
effect
upon
enactment
unless
it
states
otherwise.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
semantical
battle,
but
what
we
mean
by
this
perhaps
is
best
explicated
by
what
chief
justice
rehnquist
said
in
albernez
v.
united
states
about
the
blockberger
rule.
silence
on
the
blockberger
question
and
on
the
question
of
an
effective
date
does
not
give
rise
to
the
kind
of
ambiguity
that
would
license
a
broad-ranging
foray
into
the
statute
looking
for
hints
and
clues
that
something
else
was
intended,
and
it
doesn't
give
rise
to
an
occasion
for
application
of
the
rule
of
lenity.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
never,
your
honor.
there
has
never
been
a
case
in
this
court
in
which
the
court
has
held
that,
with
silence
on
an
effective
date,
a
delayed
effective
date
was
intended
and
in
our...
to
our
knowledge
there's
never
been
a
court...
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
should
tell
us
something.
congress
relies
on
this
rule.
when
it
enacts
a
statute
it
knows
that
putting
in
an
express
provision
that
the
effective
date
is
immediate
is
superfluous
and
therefore
it
doesn't
have
to
do
that.
and
to
question
this
axiom
would
invite
statutory
chaos
because
it
would
mean
that
every
time
congress
didn't
stipulate
an
effective
date
we'd
be
free
to
go
into
a
statute
and
look
for
little
anomalies,
little
problems
from
which
we
might
infer
a
contrary
intent.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that
is
correct.
the
statute
that
describes
what
supervised
release
is,
it
gives
it
content,
that
gives
content
to
the
word
is
not
in
effect
during
the
pertinent
period
because
under
the
'84
sentencing
act
it
was
given
in
effective
date.
but
it's
our
view
that
this
is
not
an
obstacle
to
applying
the
plain
terms
of
the
revised
penalty
provisions,
section
841,
which
clearly
state
that
supervised
release
is
the
appropriate
penalty.
because
the
fact
is
that
3583
which
describes
what
supervised
release
means
does
exist.
it's
out
there.
it's
on
the
books,
albeit
it
doesn't
have
the
force
of
law
and
perhaps
a
judge
couldn't
be
held
to
the
letter
of
it.
but
it
does
give
content
to
the
notion
of
supervised
release.
and
these
supervised
release
penalties
for
this
period
from
'86
to
'87
are
being
applied
daily
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
third
circuit,
now
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
wake
of
a
case
that
came
down
a
couple
of
months
ago,
in
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
wake
of
the
united
states
v.
brundage.
judges
are
not
going
off
on,
on
crazy
tangents
when
they,
when
they
pass
sentence
on
individuals
who
get
supervised
release.
they're
pretty
much
being
guided
by
3583,
and
the
system
is
working.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
does.
there
are
some
inconsistencies
in
the
statute
as
a
result
of
the
provision
for
supervised
release
beginning
in
october
of
1986.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
that...
it
would
avoid
some
of
them,
but
it
would
create
other
problems
and
inconsistencies
in
its
wake.
for
every
problem...
it
would
avoid
some
of
the
little
statutory
inconsistencies
but
it
would
pervert
what
congress
did
when
they
passed
this
statute.
first
of
all,
the
thesis
that
the
whole
of
section
1002
was
delayed
for
a
year
is
a
non-starter,
because
in
the
penalty
provisions
in
1986
congress
stipulated
that
there
would
be
no
parole
under
these
penalty
provisions.
they
were
mandatory
prison
terms,
and
there
simply
would
be
no
reason
for
congress
to
state
that
there's
no
parole
if
the
effective
was
november
1st,
1987,
because
as
of
november
1st,
1987,
parole
was
abolished.
so
that
in
itself
definitively
refutes
the
thesis
that
there
was
a
delayed
effective
date
for
the
whole
of
1002.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
and
if
there
is--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
would
be...
because
they
abolish
parole
in
'84
and
the
abolition
of
parole
was
going
kick
in
in
november
of--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--they
did
need
to
do
it
again.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
we're
only
saying
that
it
would
be
a
surplusage.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
and
we
think
that's
an
anomaly
as
much
as
the
anomalies
to
which--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
as
a
sign--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--but
if
we're...
if
we're
looking
at
these
anomalies
as
a
sign
of
what
congress
intended
to
do,
okay...
i
mean,
basically
petitioner's
argument
is
that
by
leaving
these
anomalies...
by
creating
these
anomalies,
by
allowing
supervised
release
to
kick
in,
congress
was
sending
us
a
message
that
it
wanted
to
delay
supervised
release.
and
we're
saying,
well,
there's
contrary
evidence
that
congress
was
sending
the
message
that
it
wanted
the
whole
of
1002
to
go
into
effect
immediately.
we're
really
making
an
argument
about
what
congress
wanted...
what
congress
meant
to
have
happen
when
it
passed
this
statute.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
the
other
reason
why
we
think
that
the
way
to
solve
whatever
anomalies
there
are
is
not
to
delay
supervised
release
is
that
congress
clearly
passed
a
provision
that
had
mandatory
monitoring
in
it,
and
we
have
to
go
a
little
bit
into
the
history
of
this
enactment
in
order
to
understand
why
that's
important.
every...
the
petitioner
and
we
both
agree
that
up
until
the
penultimate
moment
when
the
1986
act
was
passed,
the
statute
provided
for
mandatory
monitoring
in
the
form
of
special
parole
for
all
of
the
drug
categories
that
apply
to
petitioner's
offense.
so
it
was
crystal
clear
that
congress
wanted
these
individuals
to
get
a
mandatory
term
of
monitoring.
the
statute
also
provided
that
on
november
1st,
1987
there
was
going
to
be
a
word
substitution.
every
place
that
special
parole
appeared
in
the
statute,
supervised
released
would
now
appear
and
so
people
committing
offenses
after
november
1st,
1987,
would
get
supervised
release.
but
it...
but
in
no
way
did
that
draft
statute,
the
penultimate
statute,
create
a
gap
whereby
there
would
be
a
period
that
individuals
committing
these
drug
offenses
would
get
nothing.
on
the
eve
of
enactment
for
reasons
that
we
will
never
know,
a
substitution
was
made,
a
single-word
substitution.
every
place
that
the
term
special
parole
appeared
in
the
act,
the
word
supervised
released...
it
was
crossed
out
and
the
word
supervised
release
replaced
it.
the
effect
of
that
word
substitution
was
simply
to
roll
back
1
year
the
seamless
transition
from
one
kind
of
monitoring
to
another.
the
effect...
it
is...
it's
simply
perverse
to
say
that
what
congress
was
doing
when
it
substituted
those
words
was
opening
up
a
year
gap
and
sending
the
message
that
it
wanted
to
delay
the
effective
date
of
this
statute
either
in
whole
or
in
part.
this
is
especially
true
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
because
congress
knew
how
to
delay
the
effective
date
of
parts
of
this
statute.
it
did
it
in
section
1004,
1006,
1007,
and
1009
and
for
congress
to
choose
this
coy,
roundabout,
ambiguous
method
to
accomplish
the
same
thing,
it's
just
not
a
plausible
account
of
what
happened
when
congress
passed
this
statute.
what
happened
is
this.
someone
decided
that
there
was
no
reason
to
perpetuate
what
was
soon
to
be
an
outmoded
form
of
monitoring.
they
might
as
well
initiate
supervised
release
a
year
early.
but
congress
forgot
to
make
the
little...
the
collateral
changes
that
would
have
created
a
completely
harmonious
statute.
but
the
fact
that
congress
forgot
to
do
a
few
little
things
over
here
doesn't
mean
that
what
they
did
in
the
core
penalty
provisions,
what
they
did
at
the
center,
wasn't
intentional.
and--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
there
are
a
few
oversights
which
result
in
some
inconsistencies.
that...
we
concede
that.
but
we
don't
think
it
follows
from
that
either
that
congress
intended
to
delay
the
effective
date
or
that
this
court
should
square
the
circle
by
delaying
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
now,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
if
the
penultimate
change
had
never
been
made
and
the
statute
was
passed
saying
special
parole
instead
of
supervised
release
in
all
the
places
where
the
replacement
was
made,
this
would
be
a
completely
internally
consistent
and
coherent
statute.
so
the
question
arises,
you
know,
why
not
just
rewrite
the
statute
and
put
special
parole
back
where
supervised
release
is,
which
by
the
way
is
very
different
from
saying
that
the
effective
date
of
the
whole
or
part
of
the
statute
is
delayed,
which
has
very
different
consequences
in
particular
that
petitioner
won't
get
any
monitoring.
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
delaying
it.
but
why
not
just
substitute
terms?
well,
we
think
that
the
reason
not
to
do
that
is
that
the
statute
says
supervised
release
and
not
special
parole.
and--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
your
honor,
once
again
while
it's
true
that
the
definitional
provision
that
gives
meaning
to
supervised
release
or
tells
us
what
congress
meant
by
supervised
released
isn't
in
force,
it
still
does
exist.
i
mean,
it
is
there
for
guidance.
and
it's...
it's
a
little
bit
like
the
situation
that
would
obtain
if
congress
had
never
enacted
3583
of
the
definitional
provision
but
simply
had
explained
in
a
house
report
or
something
what
it
meant
by
that.
i
mean,
it's...
there
is
information
out
there.
it's
not
as
if
we
have
nothing
and
judges
have
not
acted
as
if
we
have
nothing.
that's
the
other
point.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we
think
not,
because
of
what
congress
did
when
it
passed
the
statute.
it
passed
a
statute
that
in
all
its
incarnations,
in
all
its
versions
provided
for
a
mandatory
term
of
post-confinement
monitoring
of
some
form.
there
was
never
a
version
of
this
statute
that
didn't
provide
for
mandatory
monitoring.
the
statute
was
designed
to
up
the
penalties
that
had
existed,
to
plug
gaps
that
were
perceived
in
the
previous
law,
to
compensate
for
the
inadequacies
of
previous
law.
and
it
just...
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
to
say
that
having
gone
to
all
of
this
trouble
they
really
meant
to
let
whole...
all
or
part
of
this
statute
lie
fallow
for
a
year.
it's
simply
perverse
to
solve
the
problem
by
delaying
the
effective
date,
especially
since,
as
you
suggest,
another
way
to
solve
the
problem
which
is
equally
good
and
avoids
the
problems
i've
just
talked
about
is
just
to
scratch
out
the
change
and
put
another
word
in
its
place.
but,
you
know,
both
are
equally
intrusive.
both
are
equally
activist.
and
it's
our
view
that
the
least...
the
solution
that
does
the
least
violence
to
what
congress
wrote
and
what
it
did
is
simply
to
allow
judges
to
turn
to
the
appropriate
page
in
the
united
states
code
and
read
off
the
penalty
and
pass
sentence
using
that
penalty.
there
really
is
no
practical
or
legal
obstacle
to
doing
that.
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
judge
sits
down
and
is
completely
stymied
by
what
he
sees
in
front
of
him.
and
once
again,
judges
have
been
doing
it.
they
are
doing
it.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
um--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--he's
going
to
be
in
prison
for
15
years
i
believe.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
petitioner's
correct
that
the
mandatory
good-time
provisions
under
section
4163
and
4164
will
apply
to
him,
so
he'll
have
some
time
deducted
from
his
mandatory
term
of
imprisonment.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
if
it's...
right,
if
it's
good
time.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
but
he'll
be
in
prison
for
at
least
10
years
is
my
understanding.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yeah.
so
it
will
be
at
least
10
years
before
he'll
actually
be
out
and
be
supervised.
my
final...
the
point...
one
more
point
i
want
to
make
about
this
question
of
delaying
the
supervised
release
penalty,
which
of
course
would
mean
that
petitioner
would
get
nothing.
it's
important
to
note
that
the
conflict
in
the
courts
below
has
not
really
been
about
whether
individuals
who
are...
to
commit
their
offenses
during
this
period
get
nothing
or
get
supervised
release.
almost
virtually
every
court
that's
wrestled
with
this
problem
has
ruled
that...
or
the
result
of
every
decision
has
been
that
these
offenders
get
something,
either
supervised
release
or
special
parole.
but
petitioner
is
asking
to
be
let...
to
get
nothing.
and
although
the
courts
below
have
come
out
in
different
ways
and
they've
said
different
things
and
some
have
concluded
that
the
'86
act
is
delayed
and
some
have
concluded
that
they're
not,
there's
virtually
unanimous
agreement
that
it
simply
would
not
comport
with
what
congress
did
when
it
passed
this
act
and
what
congress
intended
to
open
up,
to
create
this
opening
for
individuals
committing
these
offenses.
the
second
point
about
delaying
supervised
release
is
that
it
really
can't
be
squared
with
the
text
and
structure
of
the
841
penalty
revisions.
if
you
actually
look
at
section
1002
and
the
changes
that
it
made
to
section
841
to
the
penalties,
you'll
see
that
the
terms
of
imprisonment,
the
fines,
and
the
post-confinement
monitoring
supervised-release
requirements
are
all
put
together
in
one
paragraph.
they're
part
of
the
same...
they're
part
of
an
organic
whole.
they're
meant
to
function
together.
what
petitioner
is
saying
is
that
we're
going
to
apply
these
statutes
piecemeal.
we're
going
to
use
the
mandatory
prison
sentence
from
the
1986
act.
we're
going
to
go
back
i
suppose
to
the
1984
act
and
use
whatever
post-confinement
monitoring
requirement
there
is
in
the
1984
act.
we're
going
to
slap
together
this
patchwork
which
creates
its
own
set
of
anomalies
and
contradictions,
especially
for
cocaine
offenses.
and
in
fact
if
you
sit
down
and
look
at
how
it
works
to
use
part
of
the
'84
act
and
part
of
'86
act
you
come
up
with
blatant
contradictions.
and
that's
apparent
if
you
look
at
the
cocaine
offenses
which...
the
result
of
slapping
together
these
two
acts
would
be
that
more
serious
cocaine
offenses
would
get
a
less
harsh
sentence
than
less
serious
cocaine
offenses,
and
i
won't
bore
the
court
with
the
details
of
explaining
that.
but
that
is
the
result
of
this
patchwork
solution.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
it's
important
to
us,
justice
scalia.
in
sum,
we
believe
that
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
should
be
applied,
that
this
court
should
respect
the
unimpeachable
and
vital
legislative
principle
that
statutes
go
into
effect
immediately
unless
congress
says
otherwise
and
uphold
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
