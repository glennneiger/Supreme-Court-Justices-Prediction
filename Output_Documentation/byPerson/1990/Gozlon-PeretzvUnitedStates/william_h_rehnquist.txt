moshe
gozlon-peretz
v.
united
states.
mr.
goldberger,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are...
there
will
be
silence
in
the
court,
except
from
the
advocate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
goldberger,
are
you
suggesting
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
that
there
are
some
things
we
call
rules
of
statutory
construction,
other
things
we
call
axioms
of
statutory
construction...
that
the
two
are
different?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
the
rule
of
lenity.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
goldberger--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--judge
becker's
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
problems
that
that
court
saw
with
going
your
way
in
the
future,
and
judge
becker
has
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
of
course
to
probation
and
parole.
do
you
have
any
response
to
his
criticisms
of
your
approach
as
to
the
future?
what
would...
inconsistencies
that
would
happen
further
down
the
line?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
goldberger--
--do
our
cases
extend
the
rule
of
lenity
to
the
extent
of
punishment
as
well
as
to
the
denomination
of
the
substantive
offense?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldberger.
