justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
one
rule
was
that
statutes
normally
take
effect
on
the
date
of
their
enactment,
and
section
1002
doesn't
contain
the
language
you
point
to.
why
didn't
that
become
effective
immediately?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
don't
we
apply
the
axiom
of
construction
then
and
say
1002
became
effective
immediately
on
enactment?
justice
o'connor
xxx
axiom
as
suggested
by
your
opposition?
justice
o'connor
have
we
applied
the
rule
of
lenity
to
an
effective
date
issue?
justice
o'connor
ms.
wax,
if
we
go
along
with
the
government's
suggestion
here,
it
does
result
in
some
anomalies
and
some
problems
in
relation
to
other
statues,
does
it
not?
justice
o'connor
and
would
those
problems
be
avoided
by
the
construction
by
the
later
effective
date
suggested
by
the
petitioner?
