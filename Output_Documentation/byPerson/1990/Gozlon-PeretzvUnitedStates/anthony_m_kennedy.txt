and,
of
course,
since
he
serves
10
years
minimum,
at
the
time
that
he
is
released
all
of
the
supervised-release
provisions
that
congress
enacted
in
'84
and
in
'86
will
be
in
effect.
justice
kennedy
at
the
time
that
it
is
necessary
to
implement
this
scheme,
the
statute
will
be
fully
effective
by
its
own
terms.
justice
kennedy
well,
it,
it
goes
to
the
point
of
what
congress
probably
intended,
and
if
you're
saying
that
we
can't
know
what
supervised
release
means
because
it's
an
empty
term
without
implementing
provisions,
there
are
couple
answers.
one
is
that
the
implementing
provisions
are
on
the
books.
they're
not
enforced
yet.
the
other
is
that
the
implementing
provisions
won't
be
needed
so
far
as
effecting
the
supervised
release
until
they
are
fully
effective.

mr.

justice
kennedy
i
see.
justice
kennedy
are
there
any
cases
where
in
the
interpretation
of
statute
we
use
the
doctrine
of
incorporation
of
reference
that
we
do
in
wills,
say?
justice
kennedy
is
this...
there
was
a
body
of
extant
statutory
provisions
that
you
could
look
to.
they
weren't
in
effect
yet.
justice
kennedy
you
say
these
were
just
incorporated
by
reference?

89-7370.
between
1984
and
1987,
congress
enacted
or
changed
various
statutes
to
increase
the
severity
of
criminal
sentences
for
drug
offenders
and
to
reform
the
criminal
sentencing
process
in
general.
one
of
these
changes
was
to
move
to
a
new
concept
for
court
supervision
in
monitoring
after
a
sentence
has
been
served.
under
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984,
congress
adapted
the
system
called
supervised
release
to
replace
the
earlier
system
which
have
been
called
special
parole.
supervised
release
required
a
sentencing
court
rather
than
the
united
states
parole
commission
to
oversee
a
defendants
behavior
and
adjustment
after
being
released
from
custody.
supervised
release
gave
the
sentencing
court
greater
powers
and
responsibilities
in
this
post-confinement
period.
so
the
courts
and
court
officials
would
have
time
to
prepare
for
the
change,
the
provisions
for
supervised
release
in
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984
did
not
become
effective
until
1987.
the
problem
we
confront
in
this
case
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
this,
during
the
interim
period
before
the
sentencing
reform
act
took
effect
congress
enacted
another
statute,
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1986.
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
requires
terms
of
supervised
release
for
most
drug
offenders,
but
it
does
not
provide
an
exquisite
effective
date
for
its
relevant
provisions.
the
petitioner
who
committed
his
offense
during
this
interim
period
argues
that
because
the
sentencing
reform
act,
with
its
basic
definition
of
supervised
release,
did
not
become
effective
until
1987,
the
adaa's
provision
for
supervised
release
likewise
were
not
effective
until
that
time.
so,
he
argues
that
he
is
not
subject
to
special
parole
or
perhaps
not
subject
to
post-confinement
monitoring
at
all.
we
must
interpret
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1986
to
determine
whether
its
provisions
for
supervised
release
apply
in
this
interim
period.
we
hold
that
they
do.
when
the
adaa
was
enacted,
it
is
true
that
the
sentencing
reform
act
was
not
operational,
but
it
had
been
adapted
by
the
congress
and
signed
by
the
president.
it
had
all
of
the
weight
and
dignity
of
a
statute
and
the
reasonable
assumption
is
that
when
congress
had
passed
the
adaa
and
used
the
term
supervised
release,
it
knew
its
full
definition
and
meaning
and
legislative
with
reference
to
it.
courts
may
refer
to
enact
it,
but
yet
effective
legislation
to
interpret
statutory
terms
if
the
legislature
intends
to
reference.
in
this
case,
we
believe
the
legislature
did
have
that
intention.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
supervised
release
is
applicable
in
this
case.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
