justice
scalia
wasn't
this
just
a
mistake,
as
indicated
by
a
later
amendment
that
sought
to
plug
the
hole?
justice
scalia
and
it--
justice
scalia
--you
think
it
was
all
deliberate?
you
don't
think
that
there
was
some--
justice
scalia
--right.
justice
scalia
and
us,
too.
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
the
period
of
supervised
release
for
the
category
of
offenders
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case
was
fixed
by
the
statute.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
scalia
and
there
is
a
variety
of
conditions
that
can
be
imposed
in
supervising?
justice
scalia
indeed,
you
couldn't
look
to
the
other
statute
until
the
other
statute
is
effective.
justice
scalia
probably
improper
to
look
to
it
xx
it's
effective.
justice
scalia
is
the
definition
of
supervised
release,
plus
all
of
the
conditions
upon
it...
is
that
in
a
section
of
the
statute
that
does
not
take
effect
until
after
this?
justice
scalia
so
you
wouldn't
even
know...
you
wouldn't
even
know
how
to
handle
supervised
release
without
consulting
a
portion
of
the
statute
that's
not
yet
in
effect?
justice
scalia
well,
that
does
more
than
invoke
that
rule
of
presumption.
it
calls...
it
calls
into
play
another
one
of
the,
the
maxims
or
rules,
that
is,
inclusio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius.
justice
scalia
by
specifically
specifying
a
date
in
some
instances,
you
assume
that
where
they
don't
specify
it,
the
ordinary
rule
of
today
applies.
that...
that's
probably
the
hardest
indication
against
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
this
isn't
a
little
anomaly.
it's
the
fact
that
you
don't
know
what
this
term
of
art
means.
it's
a
brand-new
word
that
is
utterly
meaningless
to
anybody
unless
you
consult
another
statute
that
isn't
in
effect
yet.
justice
scalia
why
couldn't
i
say
that
term
has
no
meaning
until
the
other
statute
takes
effect,
and
since
it
doesn't
have
any
meaning
i'll
assume
it
seems...
it
means
the
same
thing
as
parole,
special
parole?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you...
you're
presenting
the
case,
as
you
ought
to
i
suppose,
you
know,
on
the
assumption
it's
our
function
to
figure
out
what
congress
intended.
i
don't
think
there
were
more
than
20
people
who
adverted
to
this
refinement,
this
scrivener's
change
from
special
parole
to
the
new
terminology.
it
seems
to
me
our
job
is
to
make
sense
out
of...
as
best
we
can
out
of
a
statute
that
it's...
it's
a,
you
know,
chinese
puzzle.
we're
trying
to
fit
it
together.
and
a
very
sensible
way
to
fit
it
all
together
that
doesn't
produce
any
inconsistencies
anyway
is
to,
as
we've
sometimes
done,
not
deem
the
effective
to
be
immediate.
it's
a
sensible
solution
of...
for
someone
whose
job
is
to
try
to
make
sense
out
of
the
law.
it
does
make
sense
out
of
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
we
haven't
found
this
boring.
it's
been
exciting
stuff.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
i
can't
help
but
enjoy
the
difference
between
an
axiom,
a
rule,
and
a
vital
legislative
principle.
[laughter]
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
mr.
goldberger,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
justice
scalia
there
is
an
anomaly
created
by
your
proposal
which
is
that
your
client
would
get
nothing,
neither,
neither
special
parole
nor
supervised
release.
justice
scalia
to
his
sentence.
right.
justice
scalia
would
all
of
those
be
eliminated?
suppose
we
just
interpreted
this
to
be
a
scrivener's
error
and
to
be
special
parole
instead,
would
that
eliminate
all--
justice
scalia
--yes,
right.
justice
scalia
deliberately
chosen
by
congress.
