mr.
peter
goldberger
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
interplay
between
two
lines
of
federal
criminal
statutes
enacted
over
the
past
6
years.
one
line
involves
sentencing
reform;
the
other
group
of
laws
reflects
the
desire
of
congress
to
toughen
drug
penalties.
the
judgment
below
required
imposition
of
a
term
of
supervised
release
for
an
offense
committed
before
november
1987.
only
by
reversing
that
judgment
can
all
of
the
statutes
involved
here,
which
were
certainly
meant
to
work
together,
be
reconciled.
in
1984,
after
lengthy
and
thorough
deliberation,
congress
enacted
an
scheme
of
federal
sentencing
reform,
a
comprehensive
scheme
that
included
the
abolition
of
parole,
and
also
to
be
abolished
was
that
special
form
of
extended
parole
applicable
only
to
certain
controlled
substances
cases
called
special
parole,
which
was...
in
1984,
the
sentencing
reform
act
instead
created
a
new
kind
of
post-incarceration
supervision,
to
be
called
supervised
release,
which
was
carefully
defined
and
circumscribed
in
detailed
provisions
of
that
1984
statute.
congress
realized
at
that
time
that
to
prepare
the
federal
criminal
justice
system
to
make
the
change
to
this
entirely
new
sentencing
system
would
take
time,
and
that
1984
statute
thus
initially
set
a
start-up
period
of
2
years,
in
fact
over
2
years,
for
the
new
system
before
it
would
become
effective.
congress
soon
realized
that
it
would...
that
2
years
would
not
be
long
enough
and
extended
that
period
for
another
year,
with
the
resulting
effective
date
for
supervised
release
and
all
other
new
aspects
of
the
sentencing
system
of
november
1,
1987.
meanwhile,
on
october
27th,
1986,
the
president
signed
into
law
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1986,
which
made
a
number
of
changes
in
federal
drug
sentencing,
especially
in
the
higher-volume
offenses.
this
1986
statute
used
the
term,
supervised
release,
without
giving
any
definition
for
that
term.
in
some
of
its
provisions,
including
section
1002
of
that
statute
which
is
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
under
which
my
client
was
sentenced.
petitioner
here
was
convicted
for
some
of
these
higher-volume
heroin
offenses
involving
conduct
with
occurred
in
february
1987,
which
was
of
course
after
enactment
of
that
'86
drug
act
on
october
27th
of
'86
but
before
the
effective
date
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
on
november
1,
'87.
under
the
law...
one
more
piece
of
background
that's
needed...
under
the
law
as
existed
from
1984
until
the
effective
date
of
supervised
release
under
the
'86
anti-drug
act,
persons
convicted
of
the
same
offenses
as
the
petitioner
here
would
have
been
subject
to
ordinary
parole
but
no
other
supplemental
post-confinement
supervision
or
monitoring.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
has
an
aggregate
sentence
of
20
years,
of
which
he
is
likely
to
serve
about
10
in
prison
and
then
to
serve
the
remaining
10
years
on
parole,
ordinary
pre-sentencing
reform
act
parole.
if
supervised
release
applies,
this
would
be
in
addition
to
the
petitioner's
ordinary
parole.
mr.
peter
goldberger
in
one
sense--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--in
one
sense,
justice
kennedy,
that's
true,
but
in
another
it's
not.
and
that's
because
congress
provided
in
the
effective
date
provisions
of
the
'84
act
which
govern
and
control
and
include
the
supervised-release
implementation
and
definitional
provisions
that
not
only
would
it
have
an
effective
date
of
november
1,
1987,
but
also
that
it
should
not
apply
to
any
offense
committed
before
that
date.
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
is
shall
only
apply
to
offenses
committed
after
the
taking
effect
of
the
statute,
so
that
section
35.83,
which
is
the
supervised
release
provision
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
by
its...
by
the
terms
of
its
own
effective
date
provision,
can
never
apply
to
my
client's
case
or
to
the
other
people
who
committed
offenses
between
october
'86
and
november
1,
'87.
that
was
congress'
specific
declaration
on
that
subject.
so
the
suggestion
that
the
case
is
not
significant
because,
after
all,
by
the
time
he
finishes
serving
the
10
year
imprisonment
portion
of
his
sentence
we'll
have
a
system
in
place.
it's
true
there
will
be
a...
system
in
place,
but
it
won't
be
a
system
that
applies
to
him
by
law.
mr.
peter
goldberger
well,
not
only
are
they
not
applicable,
and
of
course
when
we
look
for
congressional
intent,
the
first
thing
to
look
at
is
the
language
that
specifically
addresses
the
question.
the
language
which
addresses
that
question
is
language
which
says
that
those
implementing
provisions
do
not
apply
to
an
offense
committed
at
the
time
my
client
committed
his
offenses.
but
there's
another--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--well,
there
have
been
contentions
in
this
case
that
several
aspects
of
what
are
involved
here
have
been
mistakes.
i...
but--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--it
imposes
intriguing
problems
of
how--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--oh,
in
the
subjective
sense,
do
i
think
that
congress
intended
to
put
me
in
this
position?
mr.
peter
goldberger
i...
no.
mr.
peter
goldberger
and
especially
you.
no,
i
don't
think
it
was
deliberate
in
that
sense,
but
there
are
rules.
i
don't
think
there
was
a
member
of
congress
that
knew
at
the
moment
that
the
vote
was
taken
on
the
conference
committee
report
that
contained
the
language
"supervised
release"...
i'd
be
surprised
if
there
was
a
member
of
congress
that
had
fully
thought
through
all
of
this.
but
that's
not
where
we
look
to...
for
the
meaning
of
a
statute.
we
have
rules
to
apply
for
this
sort
of
situation,
and
the
rule
is
we
look
to
the
language
and
if
the
language
doesn't
answer
it,
then
to
any
number
of
other
provisions.
mr.
peter
goldberger
if
that...
the
require...
the...
excuse
me,
the
axiom
of
construction
that
a
statute
is
deemed
to
become
effective
immediately
if
it
doesn't
provide
otherwise
is
not
a
rule.
justice
o'connor,
it's
an
axiom
of
construction
like
any
other.
if
it
were
a
rule,
then
none
of
the
other
matters
discussed
in
the
briefs--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--because
there
is
such
a
wealth
of
other
reasons
not
to.
and
it
takes
something
to
overcome
that
axiom,
but
i
would
suggest
that
we
prevent...
presented
those
kinds
of
points,
and
they
fall
into
basically
into
three
categories.
first,
that
to
put
1002
and
especially
its
supervised-release
provisions
into
effect
immediately,
is
to
create
a
set
of
some
half-dozen
inconsistencies,
contradictions,
and
complete
nullifications
of
related
provisions
of
the
statute
that
are
not
there
if
you...
treat
the
statute
as
effective
on
november
1,
'87.
the
second
areas
of
analysis
that
overcomes
the,
the
presumptive
axiom
is
the
in
pari
materia
approach,
which
says
that
we
have
to
view
the
supervised-release
phrase,
otherwise
underfined
in
1002,
in
relation
to
all
the
other
provisions
dealing
with
supervised
release,
and
all
of
them
go
into
effect
november
1,
1987.
and,
third,
finally,
the
rule
of
lenity.
if
this
is
a
question
worth
talking
about,
if
it's
a
question
intelligent
people
could
answer
in
two
ways
and
we
can't
come
up
with
a
clear,
settled
right
answer,
it's
a
criminal
case.
so
that
whatever
power
that
axiom
has
in
civil
cases
perhaps
to
act
as
a
trump
doesn't
exist
in
criminal
cases
because
of
the
rule
of
lenity.
mr.
peter
goldberger
no,
i
don't
think
so.
well,
perhaps
the...
to
read
the
language
and
attempt
to
apply
it
as
written,
that's
a
rule.
but
there's...
i
don't
think
it's
fair...
other
than
that
and
things
of
that
category,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
rest
of
these
doctrines,
in
pari
materia
and
what
to
do
with
silence,
what
to--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--rules
that
tell
us
what
to
do
with
silence
and
ambiguity.
mr.
peter
goldberger
and
the
rule
of
lenity
are
axioms,
yes.
and
we
call
them
rules
only
using
that
word
loosely.
that's
right.
the
ambiguities
and
contradictions
which
would
exist
here,
some
of
them
are
irreconcilable
and
i
think
the
government
concedes
this,
that
if
we
do
not
adopt
the
november
1,
1987
effective
date,
which
may
have
been
gotten
to
originally
inadvertently
but
which
we
now...
is
the
resolution
of
the
problem
that
works.
the
resolution
that
works
eliminates
the
problem
of
having
several
other
statutory
provisions,
drug
sentencing
provisions,
make
cross
references
that
don't
exist.
it
eliminate
the
problem
of
having...
of
congress
in
november
of
'86
enacting
a
statute
clarifying
and
correcting
language
in
the
drug-sentencing
law
which
under
the
theory
of
the
court
below
and
advocated
by
the
government
here
would
have
been
repealed
some
weeks
earlier
so
that
we
would
then
have
a
nullity
in
the
november
'86
technical
amendments
act.
there
are
some
half-dozen
of
those
and
they're
all
treated
in
the
briefs
and
as...
i
don't
think
there,
they
fit
well
in
an
oral
presentation
but
i
think--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--yes?
mr.
peter
goldberger
no.
perhaps
i'm
remembering
a
different
part
of
the
opinion
but
i
think
what
he
was
saying
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
failure
to
have
a
uniform
answer
to
this
problem
in
all
the
circuits
would
create
inconsistencies
and
problems
down
the
line.
but
i
don't
think
he
suggested
that
having
one
clear
answer
either
way
would
create
problems
and
inconsistencies.
and
i
would
suggest
that
more
problems
and
inconsistencies
down
the
line
are
created
by
perpetuating
parole
and
special
parole
for
an
additional
year.
and
indeed
in
the
case
of...
as
the
government
seems
to
argue
in
its
brief
at
one
point
and
as
some
of
the
circuits
have...
have
held
to
reintroduce
it
where
it
had
not
existed
for
2
years
earlier,
would
create
far
more
problems
down
the
line
by
having
a
parole
system
which
there
was
no
agency
to
administer.
i
understand
that
just
this
weekend
as
congress
was
wrapping
up
its
business
in
the
judicial
improvements
act
it
may
have
extended
the
life
of
the
parole
commission
by
another
5
years.
even
to
have
extended
it,
if,
if
what
i
hear
is
right
that
if,
if
it
has
been
extended
from
1992
to
1997,
that
still
doesn't
cover
many
of
these
cases
that
have
10-year
mandatory
minimums
or
longer
and
then
under
the
government's
view
wind
up
with
people...
could
wind
up
with
people
on
parole
rather
than
simply
waiting
a
year
until
the
system
can
be
implemented
in
a
coherent
way
where
supervised
release
applies,
that
we
have
a
system
to
understand
it
and
a
system
to
administer
it.
in
fact,
there
was
a...
an
additional
part
of
the
answer
i
wanted
to
give
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
if
i
could,
and
that
was...
that
is
that
the
sentencing
reform
act
provides,
in
that
section
which
describes
supervised
release,
that
important
judgments
about
supervised
release
are
to
be
made
by
the
sentencing
judge
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
in
fact,
these
are
one
of
the
most...
this
is
one
of
the
critical
ways
in
which
supervised
release
is
fundamentally
different
from
parole
is
that
it's
to
be
decided
on
its
length,
its
conditions,
by
the
sentencing
judge
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
and
that's
not
something
that's
going
to
occur
10
years
in
the
future.
that's
something
that
had
to
occur...
might
have
had
to
occur
as
early
as
the
early
winter
of
1986
and--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--yes,
sir,
under
3583,
subsection
d.
mr.
peter
goldberger
no,
justice
stevens,
that's
not
correct.
there
is
a
minimum
period
fixed
by
the
statute--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--but
the
length
above
the
minimum
or...
and
the
decision
whether
it's
to
be
above
the
minimum
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
judge
and
must
be
decided
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
mr.
peter
goldberger
i
don't
mean
to
mislead.
the
are
provisions
both
in
terms
of
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
and
yours,
justice
stevens,
to
amend
and
modify
both
the
conditions
and
the
length
later.
but
the
initial
decision
is
clearly
imposed
on
the
judge
and
by
the
judge
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
mr.
peter
goldberger
yes,
there
are
a
few
that
are
mandatory
and
the
rest
are
in
the
judge's
discretion.
in
addition
to
these
anomalies
and
mismatches
that
the
theory
of
the
lower
court
and
of
the
government
just
can't
explain
away,
and
in
fact
the
government's
position
is
we'll
worry
about
them
in
some
other
case.
and
i
hope
that's
not
the
answer.
i
think
that
we
have
an
opportunity
here
to
answer
the
question
in
a
way
that
doesn't
require
five
more
cases
to
resolve.
the
pari
materia
argument
tells
us
that
when
a
term
is
used
in
a
statute
that...
where
no
definition
is
given
and
that
definition
clearly
refers
to
another
statute
where
that
term
was
invented,
the
sentencing
reform
act
invented
the
concept
of
supervised
release.
it's
not
a
term
that
criminal
lawyers
had
a
knowledge
of
before...
that
you
have
to
look
to
that
other
statute
and
bring
it
in.
and
then
when
that
other
statute--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
goldberger
that...
i
think
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
and
not
only
that,
you
couldn't
look
to
it
in
a
case
in
which
congress
had
explicitly
declared
that
it
shall
not
apply.
the
pari
materia
principle
i
think
also
goes
to
the
internal
interpretation
of
the
'86
act,
so
that
not
only
do
we
have
to
cross
reference
the...
the
special...
the
supervised
release
provisions
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
but
also
the
'86,
november
'86
technical
act,
but
the
other
provisions
internally
of
the
'86
anti-drug
abuse
act,
and
that's
where
the
pari
materia
argument
runs
into
the
contradiction
argument.
you
wind
up
just
with
so
many
provisions
that
don't
work
or
wind
up
being
utterly
meaningless
that
it...
you
just
can't
have
that
way
and
have
a
statute
that
make
sense.
and
if
the
intent
of
congress...
if
we
have
a
presumption
that
the
intent
of
congress
is
to
make
sense
and
not
to
be
absurd,
you
have
to
lead
in
that
direction.
the
legislative
history
doesn't
help
us
on
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
sense
of
discussing
the
purpose
of
the
change
in
language
that
occurred
at
that
last
moment
of
the
amendment
process
from
special
parole
to
supervised
release.
but
it...
and
what
it
does
tell
us
is
congress
was
in
its
usual
end-of-october
situation.
it
wanted
to
pass
a
drug
bill
this
year
and
get
it
finished,
and
that
there's
no
indication
that
there
was
a
considered
decision
to
change
the
concept
of
special
parole,
which
had
been
provided
in
the
bill
before
that,
to
supervised
release,
but
also
no
indication
that
it
was
doing
so
for
this
reason
as
opposed
to
that
reason.
so
we're
in
a
pure
analysis
of
the
statutory
language
and
structure
which
sends
us
to
the
solution
that
i'm
suggesting.
mr.
peter
goldberger
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
that's
section
3583--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--that's
right.
the
government's
position
is
that
courts
could
and
no
doubt
did
look
to
the
statute,
which
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
had
been
enacted
in
1984
and
was
there
waiting
to
go
into
effect.
but
my
response
to
that
is
that
the
statute
not
only
by
its
terms
wasn't
effective
but
was
inapplicable.
mr.
peter
goldberger
i
think--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--i--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--i
suppose
that's
pari
materia
of
a
sort.
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
other...
any
other
concept
different
from
that,
that
when
congress
uses
a
term
that
has
a
meaning,
has
a
definition
and
a
meaning,
it's...
it's...
must
be
understood
to
be
incorporating
that
definition
and
meaning.
but
in
this
case...
and
i
don't
mean
that
we
have
to
blind
ourselves
to
the
existence
on
the
books
of
this
as
yet
ineffective
statute.
what
i
mean
is
we
do
look
to
3583
and
we
look
to
it
and
we
find
that
congress
has
told
us
not
to
use
it.
and
therefore,
what
we
find
is
that
we
can't
have
the
law,
the
'86
supervised-release
provisions,
at
least
going
into
effect
before
that
other
statute
is
available
for
the
purpose
of
making
reference
to
it.
as
a
final
aid
to
statutory
construction
in
the
case,
i
do
rely
on
the
rule
of
lenity
and
i...
this
is
not
where
we
start.
it's
not
something
that
we
use
to
avoid
the
rest
of
the
problems
and
the
issues,
but
it's
a
place
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
discussing
a
sentencing
provision
that
is
ambiguous...
it's
ambiguous
by
virtue
of
silence
and
by
virtue
of
contradiction...
is
entitled
to
look.
the
court
should
not
rely
in
making
its
decision
in
any
way
on
an
assumption
that
congress
intended
to
add
new
punishment,
and
that's
what
it
would
be
in
my
client's
case,
new
punishment
of
extended
supervision,
without
a
clear
indication
that
intended
to
do
so
when
there's
another
plausible
interpretation.
mr.
peter
goldberger
oh,
yes,
quite
clearly
so,
bifulco
being
the
most
important
case
and
in
many
ways
the
most
similar
to
this
one.
there's
a
case
in
which
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
antecedent
of
supervised
release,
that
is
special
parole.
an
ambiguity
by
virtue
of
silence
was
found,
and
the
court,
after
careful
analysis
of
the
statutory
language,
cross
references,
and
purpose,
finally
turned
also
to
the
rule
of
lenity
and--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--no,
there
is
no
provision
of
that
kind
in
the
'86
act.
there
is
only...
there
are
other...
perhaps
what
you're
thinking
of
is
that
there
are
other
effective
dates
stated
later
than
october
'86
for
certain
specified
provisions
of
the
'86
act
and
silence
with
respect
to
this
provision
and
that
then...
many
but
a
minority
of
the
lower
courts
upheld
invokes
that,
that
rule
of
presumption
that
justice
o'connor
referred
to
early
on
in
the
argument.
mr.
peter
goldberger
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
goldberger
well,
i...
it's...
it's
an
important
argument
that
the
other
side
has
and
it
would
be
surprising
to
me
though
if
there
were
a
difficult
problem
of
statutory
construction
like
this
one
in
which
you
couldn't
invoke
some
maxim
in
latin
on
each
side.
my
favorite
one
in
this
case
is
in
pari
materia.
theirs
is--
[laughter]
--expressio
unius.
mr.
peter
goldberger
but
there's
more
to
say
about
it
than
that,
which
is
that
if
the
bill
which
provided
for
special
parole
had
remained
in
that
form
and
had
been
enacted
saying
special
parole
rather
than
supervised
release,
i
think
expessio
unius
would
have
won
the
day
if
someone
had
tried
to
make,
in
that
situation,
the
argument
that
i'm
making.
it
was
by
virtue
of
the
substitution
of
terminology
to
supervised
release
to
a
term
which...
which
necessarily
makes
reference
to
another
statute
and
which
is
meaningless
without
that
other
statute,
which
would
in
effect
be
telling
a
judge,
you
may
impose
a
sentence...
you
shall
impose
a
sentence
of
something
called
supervise
release
but...
of
which
we
will
not
tell
you
the
meaning.
you
can
impose
a
sentence
of
your
own
design
in
this
case
i
think
that's
very
problematic.
mr.
peter
goldberger
of
course.
mr.
peter
goldberger
there
are
arguments
to
be
made
and
which
we
have
made
in
our
brief,
and
i'm
not
retreating
from
them
but
they're
not
the
arguments
that
i've
make
so
far
this
morning.
mr.
peter
goldberger
no,
not
necessarily.
there
are...
not
all
of
the
arguments
i
make
are
applicable
to
the
rest
of
the
section.
there
is
not
that
pari...
the
pari
materia
argument
of
incorporating
the
sentencing
reform
act
does
not
come
into
play
for
the
argument
against
the
mandatory
minimums
and
against
the
non-parolability.
they
are
similar
to
and
do
evoke
the
new
sentencing
reform
act,
but
they
are
not
utterly
dependent
on
the
sentencing
reform
act
in
[inaudible].
mr.
peter
goldberger
well,
if
you
accept
my
argument
you
won't
have
to
decide
that,
because
you
will
decide,
as
argued
in
point
a(2)
of
our
brief
that,
that
the
whole
of
1002
didn't
go
into
effect
november
1,
'87.
but
if
you
go--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--and
1032
and
1866,
there
are
a
number
of
sections
of
the
statute
that
follow
the
same
pattern,
but
that's...
it's
not--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--there's
no
split
in
the
circuits
on
that...
on
that
point.
i,
of
course,
stand
by
the
arguments
we've
made
in
the
brief
on
that.
but
they...
the
whole
argument
does
not
stand
or
fall
on
that
provision.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
peter
goldberger
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
not
asking
in
this
case
for
a
delay
in
the
implementation
of
supervised
release.
the
government
is
asking
for
an
acceleration
of
the
effective
date
of
supervised
release
by
more
than
an
entire
year
ahead
of
the
date
that
congress
decided
it
would
take
for
the
system
to
gear
up
and
be
ready
to
implement
this
entirely
new
form
of
sentencing.
mr.
peter
goldberger
he
hardly
gets
a
nothing.
he
gets
nothing
in
addition
to--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--10
years
in
prison
and
10
years
of
post-incarceration
supervision,
because
and
precisely
because
he's
a
pre-november
1,
'87,
offender.
he
receives
both
mandatory
release
supervision
by
virtue
of
the
good-time
laws
which
go
out
of
effect
for
post-november
1,
'87,
cases
and
he
receives
parole
on
his
conspiracy
sentence
for
10
years
which
wouldn't
exist
had
it
been
a
post-november
'87
sentence.
so
the
anomaly
that
the
government
offers
really
doesn't
exist.
in
fact
it
cuts
in
our
favor
by
showing
the
rationality
of...
or...
let's...
the
lack
of
irrationality
i
think
is
more
fair,
yes,
of
saying
that
congress
was
willing
to
tolerate
a
year's
delay
in
the
reinstitution
of
extra
supervision
for
this
small
category
of
offenders
to
avoid
upsetting
a
very
complicated
transition
to
a
whole
new
sentencing
system.
it's
true
that
there's
never
been
a
case
in
this
court
resolving
a
controversy
about
an
effective
date
by
finding
that
it
was
delayed.
that's
because
in
200
and
more
years
there's
never
been
a
case
in
this
court
resulting
in
controversy
about
an
effective
date,
so
that
doesn't
tell
us
anything.
and
it's
certainly
not
true
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
never
found
a
delayed
effective
date.
the
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
in
the
cases
underlying
the
conflict
that
you're
here
to
resolve
now
have
ruled
in
our
favor
by
finding
that
there
was
a
delay.
this
is
because...
the
reason
the
majority
of
the
circuits
have
gone
this
way
is
because
that
it
is
not
fair
to
say
that
there
are
just
a
few
little
problems
created
by
an
immediate
effective
date.
there
are
massive
and
irreconcilable
problems
in
interpreting
this
and
other
drug
sentencing
statutes.
the
problems
are
irreconcilable--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--there
is...
there's
absolutely
no
legislative
history
explaining
this
precise
change.
it
occurred
after
a
bill
can...
saying
special
parole
had
passed
both
houses.
the
change
occurred
only
in
the
reconciliation
process.
mr.
peter
goldberger
we
don't
know
by
whom
or
why.
mr.
peter
goldberger
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
sufficient
argument
against
the
presumption
axiom--
mr.
peter
goldberger
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
peter
goldberger
this
and
all
of
those
other
contradictions
where
certain
other
provisions
in
the
845
series
of
drug
statutes
incorporate
by
reference
and
refer
to
sections
of
841(b),
the
basic
drug-sentencing
law,
and
say,
and
this
person
shall
receive
twice
the
term
of
special
parole
as
someone
sentenced
under
841(b)
and
here
congress
said
there
is
no
special
parole
under
841(b).
it's
something
else.
so
it's
both
the
contradictions
and
the
pari
materia
use
of
a
term
defined
else
where.
mr.
peter
goldberger
it
absolutely
would
eliminate
it,
but
we
agree
with
the
government
that
that
is
the
first
impermissible
answer
to
the
problem.
mr.
peter
goldberger
and
that's
because
it's
the
only
one
that's
directly
contrary
to
the
language
deliberately
chosen
by
congress.
mr.
peter
goldberger
well,
we
know
that
congress
changed
the
words
"special
parole
term"
to
the
words
"term
of
supervised
release".
and
we
know
that
that
didn't
happen
by
computer
error.
we
know
that
it
happened
by
human
act.
now
it
may
have
happened
by
human
error,
but
it
happened
by
human
action
and
it
was
then
voted
on
in
those
terms
by
both
houses.
and
when
congress
has
voted
for
certain
words
which
it
knows
or
ought
to
know
are
different
from
other
words,
then
that
is...
it
would
be
a
deviation
from
the
judicial
function
to
solve
the
problem
by
rewriting
the
statute.
