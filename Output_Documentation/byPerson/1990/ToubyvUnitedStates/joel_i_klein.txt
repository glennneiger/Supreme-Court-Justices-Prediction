mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
that
we
challenge...
the
temporary
scheduling
provision
of
the
controlled
substances
act
gives
the
attorney
general
unchecked
power
to
adopt
and
then
to
enforce
criminal
prohibitions
against
previously
lawful
behavior.
we
think
the
statute
raises
two
important
structural
issues
concerning
congress'
power
to
delegate
criminal
rulemaking
authority.
first,
may
congress
combined
in
one
government
official
two
core
separated
functions...
the
power
to
create
a
crime
and
the
power
to
prosecute
individual
violators?
and
second,
may
congress
bar
judicial
review
of
criminal
rulemaking
determinations,
either
completely
as
we
read
the
statute,
or
at
least
until
after
someone
is
indicted,
as
the
government
reads
the
statute?
our
argument
is
that
neither
practice...
neither
practice,
much
less
both
in
the
same
statute
is
consistent
with
a
government
of
properly
separated
powers.
now,
before
addressing
each
of
these
issues
individually,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
how
unprecedented
this
statute
truly
is.
this
court
of
course
has
never
approved
either
practice.
and
that's
not
surprising,
because
for
all
intents
and
purposes
congress
has
never
adopted
these
kind
of
practices
in
any
previous
statute.
so
far
as
we
can
tell
no
statute
gives
the
attorney
general
or
any
other
official
the
power
to
make
and
enforce
a
criminal
sanction
against
purely
private
conduct.
the
example
that
the
government
gives...
the
only
example
i
presume
that
they
were
able
to
find...
is
regulations
controlling
prison
access.
but
we
think
that's
so
entirely
distinguishable,
because
the
government
there
and
the
attorney
general
is
responsible
for
the
operation
of
that
building
much
as
any
department
would
be
for
the
operation
of
its
own
buildings.
but
that's
very
different
from
purely
private
conduct.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
president?
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
justice
scalia,
but
i
think...
i
think
there
are
two
distinctions
there.
first
of
all,
in
both
instances,
that
is
first
as
you
say
the
president
has
to
tell
them...
the
hhs
secretary...
how
he
wants
the
crime
defined.
now,
in
that
regard
the
hhs
secretary
doesn't
have
to
follow
the
president.
and
if
he
doesn't
in
that
respect,
of
course
he's
removable
by
congress.
so--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no,
he
didn't,
but
he
got--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
he
did.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
think
it
is
in
a
structural
sense,
justice
scalia.
and
i
think
the
distinction
is
important.
i
understand
as
the
statute
worked
out
there
were
two
judgments
here.
this
statute,
however,
uniquely
i
suggest,
gives
one
department
both
functions.
now,
i
think
there
were
both
practical
as
well
as
structural
considerations
when
you
say
hhs
passes
the
statute,
and
then
the
government...
the
justice
department...
enforces
it.
and
let
me
suggest
to
you
that's
not
an
argument
that's
unique
to
me.
that's
an
argument
the
government
makes
when
it
says
that
the
department
of...
of
epa
should
not
have
criminal
enforcement
powers.
the
justice
department
opposes
that
same
look.
there
should
be
two
separated
judgments
here.
one
is
to
define
the
crime
and
the
other
is
to
prosecute
the
violator.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i...
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
perception,
and
let
me
suggest
i
think
the
legislative
history
suggests
otherwise
as
well.
and
that
is
to
say
i
think
the
justice
department,
at
least,
and
the
dea...
its
unique
perspective
is
a
law
enforcement
perspective.
and
i
think
that's
not
true
of
other
regulatory
agencies
or
departments.
and
i--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--not...
not
to
the
same
department.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--let
me
say
the
only
authority
that
i've
uncovered
i
think
are
cases
like
gagnon
and
morrissey
which
say
the
same
person
in
the...
in
the
executive
cannot
prosecute
a
parole
violation
as
well
as
sit
on
it.
that
is
it
separates
the
adjudicatory
and
the
prosecutorial
function.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
agree,
but,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
reason
there's
no
authority...
there's
no
contrary
authority
either.
and
that's
because
it...
congress
has
never
done
this
before.
now,
let
me
suggest
to
you
why
i
think
it's
an
important
part
of
the
delegation
doctrine.
i
think
we
have
to
take
a
step
back.
i
think
we'd
all
agree
defining
crimes
and
prosecuting
crimes,
those
are
core
separated
functions.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
that's
why
we
have
a
congress
to
begin
with
and
an
executive.
now,
what's
happened--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--absolutely.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
and...
and
i
agree.
and
the
reason
as
i
think
you've
pointed
out
in
the
american
petroleum
cases
as
well
as
the
court,
chief
justice
[inaudible],
that's
a
product
of
practical
necessity.
in
other
words,
look,
we
realize
society
is
too
complex
and
too
technical
for
congress
to
be
making
every
single
decision.
so
it
delegates
the
power
to
fill
in
the
blanks.
now,
having
done
that
much
as
a
product
of
practical
necessity,
i
don't
see
why
it
follows
that
automatically
the
concern
for
two
separated
judgments
is
eliminated.
and
up
until
now
it's
always
been
respected.
in
other
words--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
believe
that's
inherent
in
separation
of
powers.
i
think
that
that
is...
i
think
that
is
the
understructure.
that's
why
we
have
a
legislative
department.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
the
only
case
i
say
is
gagnon.
i
mean,
why
must
there
be
a
separation
of
the
prosecutorial
and
adjudicatory
functions?
that's
within
the
executive
branch.
if--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no,
sir,
i
don't.
i
think
the
standard--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it
can't.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
justice
white,
if
i
can...
i
don't
want
to...
i
don't
want
to
debate
words...
but
i
think
by
definition
congress
doesn't
delegate
executive
functions.
if
it
delegates,
it's
delegates
legislative
functions.
that's
its
role.
that's
why
i
think
the
court
said,
look,
we
need
an
intelligible
standard.
you
can't
tell
the
attorney
general
go
make
criminal--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
believe
the
executive
exercises
executive
power.
however,
i
think
the
question
of
whether
its
executive
power
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
law-making
power
is
just
not
accurate.
there's
no
question
today
that
the
attorney
general--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--absolutely.
and
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that's
a
product
of
practical
necessity.
we
can't
expect
congress
to
do
the
fine
details.
but
why
does
it
follow...
and
the
fact
that
there's
no
precedent
i
suggest
isn't
instructive
because
the
issue
is
one
of
first
impression...
why
would
it
follow
if
you
need
executive
expertise
to
define
a
standard
that
therefore
you
can
merge
would
have
to
be
two
classically
core-separated
functions?
i
mean,
i
can't
understand...
when
we
start
out
we
have
a
legislator
and
an
executive.
i
would
suggest
if
you
go
back
to...
to
locke
and
to
montesquieu
and
so
forth,
the
basic
function
in
those
two
different
departments
is
on
the
one
hand,
one
makes
the
criminal
law
and
the
other
enforces
it.
now,
we
have
said
that--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
believe
that...
i
believe
it's
a
separation
of
powers,
but
i
think...
i
think
a
part
of
separation
of
powers
is
due
process.
it's
the
process
by
which
we
govern
ourselves.
and
i
think
that's
what
separation
is.
i
don't
think
there's
any
substantive
difference.
in
gagnon
the
court
found
it
to
be
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
gagnon
v.
scarpelli
and
morrissey
v.
brewer,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
it
is.
it's
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
no,
it's
not.
it's
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
it
does.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
he
does.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
no,
i
don't--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--and
i
think
there's
a
critical
distinction.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i...
let
me
say
what
i
think
the
critical
distinction
is,
justice
o'connor.
and
that
is
in
the
permanent
statute,
before
the
attorney
general
can
do
anything,
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
has
to
approve
the
schedule.
that
is,
the
matter
goes
first
to
hhs.
hhs
makes
a
determination
on
the
scientific
factors
and
has
absolute
discretion
to
veto
any
proposed
schedule.
so
you
have
two
clear,
separated
judgments
there.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
agree
that
we
normally
don't
think
of
it
that
way,
but
that's
because
i
don't
think
this
issue,
which
i
think
is
unique
in
our
history,
has
been
raised
before.
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem.
for
example,
i
wouldn't
be
here
saying,
you
can
give
power
to
osha
but
not
to
epa
or
to
any
other
agency.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
there's
an
underlying
core
principle
which
i
think
we
share,
and
that
is
criminal
laws
should
be
made
by
congress
or,
to
the
extent
that
they
have
to
be
delegated
as
a
matter
of
necessity,
we
should
make
sure
there
are
two
separated
judgments.
it's
not
a
perfect
separation.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but,
justice
scalia,
with
respect,
the
statute
says
the
attorney
general
has
the
power.
i'm
tackling
the
statute.
i
understand
he
subdelegated
it.
we
question
that,
too.
the
statute
says
the
attorney
general,
he
can
make
this
drug
a
crime.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
i
think...
i
think
the
theory
is
even...
is
even
questionable
in
the
following
sense.
if
the
attorney...
if
the
president
tells
the
attorney
general
to
make
something
a
crime,
i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
is
required
to
do
that.
i
think
the...
that's
happened
before
where
the
president
has
instructed
a
cabinet
officer
and
the
cabinet
officer
has
declined.
so
i
think
it's
a
structural
matter.
it's
not
the
same--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--that's
still
a
different
consideration,
mr.
chief
justice,
than
making
something
a
crime.
the
president
cannot
make
it
a
crime.
the
president
can
fire
the
attorney
general,
presumably.
the
president
can
take
other
actions.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
ultimately,
i
suppose,
that's
right,
but
i
think
that's
a
significant
check.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
i
think
to
say
that
that
is
some...
somehow
no
different
from
having
on
the
one
hand
health
and
human
services
promulgating
a
criminal
enforcement
regulation,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
attorney
general
being
in
power
to
enforce
it,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
big
difference
structurally.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it's
a
due
process
case.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
agree
with
that.
but
i...
i
think
that
due
process
has
an
underlying
core
of
separated
powers.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
i...
i
don't
mean
it
to
be
mushy.
i
just
think
that
both
due
process
and
separation
of
powers
go
to
the
way
in
which
we
govern
ourselves
vis-a-vis
the
individual
and--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--okay.
but
i...
but
i
think
from
our
point
of
view
if
this
were...
i
don't
think
there's
any
substantive
difference
if
this
were
a
due
process
violation
than
if
it's
a
separation
of
powers.
i
think
it's
more
properly
categorized
here
as
a
separation
of
powers,
because
of
what
i
view
as
two
separate
judgments.
now,
the
second
point
in
this
statue
which
is
equally
novel,
and
i
think
equally
troubling,
is
the
elimination
or
curtailment
of
judicial
review.
now,
i
want
to
say
at
this
point
we're
starting
from
a
provision
where
there
is
no
check.
that
is,
the
two
checks,
even
if
they're
not
required,
they're
eliminated,
and
the
attorney
general
now
has
the
power
to
make
a
crime
and
to
enforce
it.
and
the
question
is
can
congress
then
eliminate
or
severely
restrict
judicial
review.
there's
some
dispute
about
the
language
which
i
want
to
come
to.
but
the
government
agrees
that
this
statute
says
there
could
be
no
pre-enforcement
review.
in
other
words,
the
attorney
general
can
take
any
drug
and
he
can
make
it
a
crime...
or
the
dea
administrator...
for
18
months,
during
which
period...
no
matter
whether
that
appears
to
be
arbitrary,
inconsistent
with
the
intelligible
principle
that
congress
set
down
or
what
have
you.
during
that
18
month
period,
no
citizen
can
seek
judicial
review
unless
he's
willing
to
first
of
all
violate
the
statute.
second
of
all,
subject
himself
to
investigation
and
prosecution.
and
then
third
of
all,
take
the
risk
that
if
his
challenge
turns
out
not
to
be
correct,
he
can
be
convicted
for
10
or
more
years
for
having
violated
it.
now,
we
think
that
is
a
phenomenal
amount
of
power
in
and
of
itself,
even
if
you
couldn't
back
it
up
with
the
enforcement
power
that
the
attorney
general
can.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
suppose
we
had
a
reg
at
the
department
of
transportation,
and
that
reg
said
that
the
secretary
could
determine
for
a
period
of
18
months
which
cars
are
unsafe
and
that
should
be
done
in
accordance
with
the
kind
of
criteria
here,
dangerous
to
the
public
and
so
forth.
and
if
that
statute
said,
for
18
months
nobody
could
judicially
challenge
it
except
after
prosecution,
i
think
we
would
see
clearly
that
that
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
power
that's
unwarranted,
that
shouldn't
be
granted,
and
that
the
fundamental
structural
check
of
judicial
review
should
be
preserved
here.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
i
think
there
are
two
avenues
that
this
court
has
widely
recognized.
and
one
of
course
congress
provides
for
immediate
judicial
review
of
regulations
in
terms
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
and
that's
a
customary
practice.
and
second
of
all,
this
court
time
and
again
has
upheld
district
court
challenges,
pre-enforcement
challenges
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
you
don't
have
to
wait
until
you
violate
it.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
but
that's
the
key
distinction.
here
if
you're
affected...
if
i...
if
i
take...
if
i
am
manufacturing
this
drug,
and
i
am
affected
by
this
regulation,
according
to
the
government,
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
violate
it
and
test
it.
if
i
am
driving
an
automobile,
under
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
justice
scalia,
and
i'm
driving
that
car
and
this
regulation
comes
into
effect
and
says
you
can
no
longer
drive
it.
according
to
the
government,
i've
got
to
violate
the
law
and
take
the
risk
of
penalty.
that's
not
happened
before.
in
fact
the
only
case
that
came
close
in
the
abbott
labs
in
the
toilet
case,
justice
harlan
for
the
court
read
it
exactly
the
opposite--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
say
the
only
time
it
happened
the
statute
was
read
the
other
way.
that
is
justice
harlan
read
the
statute
not
to
bar
preliminary
review.
and
the...
and
the
justice
department...
i
mean,
the
attorney...
pardon
me...
the
government
gives
no
example--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--there
is...
it's
not
a
constitutional
decision,
although
i
suggest
that
a
year
later
in
oestereich,
justice
harlan
at
least
suggested
that
pre-enforcement
review
is
a
constitutional
necessity.
but
abbott
laboratories,
i
think
its
novelty
is
what
is
the
standard
in
terms
of
equitable
discretion
as
to
when
a
court
will
hear
it.
that
seems
very
different
from
a
congressional
bar.
here
congress
is
saying,
this
is
the
law
of
the
land...
for
18
months
nobody
can
go
into
court
and
challenge
it.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
estep
the
court
read
into
the
selective
service
regulations
a
post-induction...
you
don't
have
to
be
indicted.
you
go
into
the
military--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--you
could
challenge
it
if
you
went
into
the
military.
in
other
words,
you
could--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--seek
habeas
corpus.
but--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--yes,
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
said
indicted.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
you
could
there
be...
you
could
challenge
it
prior
to
any
indictment.
and
the
other
thing
i
would
say
is
those
are
adjudicatory
determinations.
they're
not
generic
rules,
which
is
exactly
the
point
the
court
relied
on
in
interpreting
oestereich,
or
justice
harlan
relied
on...
that
in
the
one
instance
we're
talking
about
thousands
of
individual
classification
decisions.
even
there
you
can
get
judicial
review.
and
in
the
other
instance
we're
talking
about
a
generic
criminal
rule.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
think
that's
constitutionally
inadequate
for
the
reasons
i've
given.
but
let
me
suggest
i
don't
think
that's
clear
from
the
statute
either,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is,
i
think
the
government
is
making
that
concession
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
because
they
can't
defend
the
statute
as
it's
written.
the
statute
as
it's
written...
the
words
are
absolutely
clear...
say
that
the
scheduling
order
under
the
temporary
statute
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review,
period.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
pre-enforcement
or
post-enforcement
or
timing
or
anything.
that's
what
the
statute
says,
and
i
think
if
you
take
those
words
for
what
they
must
mean,
they
mean
that
even
after
you're
indicted
and
even
after
you're
convicted,
you
cannot
test
whether
or
not
this
regulation
complies
with
the
underlying
statute,
with
the
standards.
that's
what
it
says
and
i
think
that's
a
blanket
prohibition.
and
i
don't
think
the
government
should
be
allowed
to
re-write
the
statute
to
say
that.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
court
of
appeals
even
read
it
more
curiously,
justice
white,
that
if
it
didn't--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--they
said
we
don't
foreclose
that.
they
didn't
say
they'd
allow
it.
and
second
of
all,
i
think
frankly
they
are
misreading
the
statute,
too.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i...
i
think
they
didn't
read
it
the
way
i
did.
the
district
court
read
it
exactly
the
way
i
did.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--said...
that's
correct.
but
i
think
that
the
statute,
justice
white,
speaks
for
itself.
that
is,
i
don't
think
there's
a
question
of
law.
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
reading
is
entitled
to
any
deference.
and
as
i
say,
the
words,
it
seems
to
me,
are
absolutely
clear
on
this
issue.
and
then
the
government
says,
well,
those
words
mean
you
can't
have
pre-enforcement
review,
you
can
have
post-prosecution
review.
well,
do
they
get
that?
you
know,
up
until
now,
with
congress'
limited
judicial
review,
it
virtually
always
limits
it
to
pre-prosecution
review.
and
there's
a
reason
for
that...
that
is,
cases
like
yakus
or
adamo
wrecking
or
so
forth.
congress
says,
look,
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
challenge
this
into
prosecution
because
we
want
to
get
the
standards
settled.
there's
a
sort
of
finality
interest
that
congress
has.
for
the
first
time
in
this
statute,
it's
basically
saying,
according
to
the
government
without
the
words,
you
can
challenge
it
only
in
an...
after
you're
indicted
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
we
don't
think
the
words
bear
that.
the
final
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
simply
with
respect
to
subdelegation
and
the
issue
of
assigning
this
to
the
dea.
our
argument
is
just
a
straightforward
one,
and
that
is
the
power
at
issue
here
is
certainly
unique.
even
if
the
court
should
find
that
unconstitutional,
it's
unique.
and
we
think
that
relying
on
subdelegation
statutes
that
go
back
10,
15
years
before
this
power
was
ever
contemplated,
that
reliance
on
that
is
really
unwarranted
here,
that
a
contemporary
expression
with
this
kind
of
power
of
the
authority
to
subdelegate.
after
all,
a
subdelegation
clause
provides
the
power
to
give
this
to
any,
quote,
"employee"
of
the
justice
department.
and
we
think,
as
the
tenth
circuit
said
in
the
widdowson
case,
the
analogue
for
this
one,
that
that's
just
too
broad
a
power
to
allow
under
a
general
delegation.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that's
not
accurate.
let
me
explain
why
if
i
might,
justice
stevens.
and
that
is
to
say,
under
the
food
and
drug
act,
if
i
produce
this
drug
in
my
house,
which
is
what
my
client
was
convicted
of,
that's
not
a
crime.
he
was
convicted
of
manufacturing
and
conspiracy
to
manufacture.
under
the
food
and
drug
act,
if
i
had
sold
this
drug
in
interstate
commerce,
that
would
be
a
crime.
but
the
act
for
which
my
client
was
convicted
would
not
have
been
a
crime,
but
for
the
attorney
general's...
or
the
dea's
determination.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
correct,
sir.
and
that
would
be
true
as
well
for
possession,
not
just
manufacture,
but
possession
as
well.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
on
this
issue
of
whether
prior
behavior
was
already
criminal,
justice
stevens,
to
begin
with
even
under
the
government's
view,
if
i've
registered,
which
lots
of
people
do,
then
it
is
no
crime
for
me
to
manufacture
this
drug
in
my
home.
but
once
the
attorney
general
passes
this
regulation,
it
then
becomes
a
crime.
so
something
that
was
noncriminal
is
now
a
crime.
by
the
same
token,
i
could
possess
this
drug.
there
is
no
requirement
there.
and
that
becomes
a
crime
once
it's
scheduled.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
is
on
judicial
review.
and
the
justice
department
says
what
the
statute
really
refers
to
is
877,
which
is
the
general
judicial
review
statute.
that
statute
only
says
there
shall
be
judicial
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
it
doesn't
say
anything
at
all
about
judicial
review
in
district
courts.
so
the...
the
government's
argument
doesn't
even
fit
its
own
theory.
in
other
words,
if
all
that
congress
meant
to
do
was
take
out
877,
which
the
words
don't
support.
but
if
that's
all
that
it
meant
to
do,
there
still
could
be
pre-enforcement
actions,
injunctive
and
declaratory,
in
the
district
courts,
because
this
statute
doesn't
mention
it
and
that
is
a
common
and
typical
way.
so
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
government's
forcing
the
words
doesn't
even
go
with
its
theory.
finally,
the
issue
of
whether
it
would
be
constitutional,
justice
scalia,
to
eliminate
judicial
review
here
altogether
seems
to
me
at
least
the
court
has
said
twice
that
it
would
be
impermissible.
that
is
in
skinner
v.
mid-america,
which
is
a
delegation
case.
i
realize...
the
terminology
is
the
court's
not
mine.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
a
delegation
of
power
was
valid
so
long
as,
quote,
"a
court
could
ascertain
whether
the
will
of
congress
has
been
obeyed.
"
that
point
was
made
as
well
in
chada.
so
i
suggest
to
you
if
this
was
a
blanket
preclusion,
that
in
fact
it
would
not
comport
with
these...
with
this
court's
principles
and
that's
exactly
why
the
government
is
trying
to
fiddle
with
the
language.
thank
you.
