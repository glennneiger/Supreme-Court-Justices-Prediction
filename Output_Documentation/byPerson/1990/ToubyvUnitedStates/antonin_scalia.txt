justice
scalia
what
about
the
president?
justice
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
statutes
that
give
many
federal
officials
the
right
to
define
crimes...
the
secretary
of
hhs,
for
example.
and
the
president
can
tell
the
secretary
of
hhs,
no,
i
don't
want
it
defined
this
way,
i
want
it
defined
another
way.
now,
that
crime
would
be
prosecuted
after
it's
defined
by
hhs
by
the
attorney
general.
but
the
president
can
also
tell
the
attorney
general,
yes,
i
want
it
prosecuted,
no,
i
don't
want
it
prosecuted.
justice
scalia
did
the
attorney
general
personally
prosecute
this
case?
justice
scalia
so
it's
the
same
situation,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
mean
it
isn't
that
the
attorney
general
both...
in
fact
did
the
attorney
general
personally
do
you
think
define
the
drug
offense
or
do
you
think...
he
delegated
that
to
dea,
didn't
he?
justice
scalia
so
you
had
two
different
federal
officials,
one
making
the
determination
of
what's
a
crime,
and
another
one,
a
united
states
attorney
presumably,
making
the
prosecution
which
is
the
same
thing
you
have
with
hhs.
justice
scalia
you
know
i
expect
the
justice
department
as
a
whole
today
is
larger
than
the
entire
federal
government
was
oh,
perhaps,
certainly
when...
in
the
first
century
of...
of
the
republic.
so
that,
you
know,
the
diversity
of
personnel
that
you
have
would
be
dea
making
the...
one
decision,
the
united
states
attorney
making
the
other,
is
exactly
the
diversity
you
would
have
had
in
the
entire
federal
government
had
two
different
departments
done
this...
the
work.
justice
scalia
but
there
aren't
separate...
you
either
have
to
make
it
depend
upon
the
executive,
in
which
case
the
president
has
everything,
or
else
your
objection
is
that
it's
the
same
person
that's
doing
both.
and
it
isn't
the
same
person
doing
both.
it's
the
administrator
of
dea
in
one
case
and
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
other.
now,
they
both
happen
to
be
in
the
justice
department.
but
it's
the
same
thing
if
it's
the
secretary
of
hhs
and
the
justice
department.
they
both
happen
to
be
in
the
executive
branch,
but
they're
different
people.
justice
scalia
and
the
constitution
says
that
the
president
can
make
the
drug
a
crime,
because
any
power
that's
delegated
to
the
attorney
general
belongs
to
the
president.
the
president
can
tell
the
attorney
general
to
change
it.
even
if
it's
given
to
hhs,
you
have
it
technically
in
one
person:
the
president
of
the
united
states.
so
if
the
image
of
it...
if
it's
somehow
not
the
practicality
of
the
matter,
but
the
theory
that
troubles
you,
that
theoretical
problem
exists
in
every
case.
it
is
theoretically
the
president
of
the
united
states
who's
making
both
decisions.
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
understand
why.
i
mean
that
happens
every
time
congress
passes
a
law
certainly.
you...
you
don't...
a
criminal
statute,
you...
if
you
want
to
challenge
it,
you
violate
it.
it
may
be
unconstitutional,
but
you
have
to
wait
until
you're
prosecuted,
and
then
you
challenge
it
at
that
point.
justice
scalia
oh,
you
certainly
do
unless
you've
been...
unless
you're
affected
by
its
mere
existence...
unless
your
business
is
affected
by
its
mere
existence.
justice
scalia
you're
saying
abbott
labs
is
a
constitutional
decision?
justice
scalia
i
thought
abbott
labs
was
considered
quite
a
novelty
when
it
was
pronounced,
that
you're
entitled
to
pre-enforcement
review
of
a
regulation.
i
never
thought
that
it
was
regarded
as
a
constitutional
decision,
that
you
are
absolutely
entitled
under
the
constitution
to
pre-enforcement
review
of
a
regulation.
justice
scalia
you're
saying
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
constitutional
delegation?
justice
scalia
the
term
delegation
is
really
a...
a
misusage.
there's
either
a
delegation
in
which
case
it's
unconstitutional
or
there's
no
delegation.
justice
scalia
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
when
you
say
it
the
other
way,
people
are
inclined
to
refer
to
constitutional
delegations
of
legislative
power.
justice
scalia
why
can
they
do
that
in
light
of
the
words
in
the
statute?
justice
scalia
where
is
judicial
review
provided
for?
justice
scalia
what's
that?
justice
scalia
that's
not...
that's
not
in
your
brief.
justice
scalia
21
u.s.c.?
justice
scalia
i'll
get
it.
it's
all
right.
justice
scalia
do
you
agree
that
this
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
if
you
read
section
6
to
preclude
judicial
review
entirely?
justice
scalia
it
wouldn't.
justice
scalia
well,
then
why
should
i
read
it
that
way?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
say
here
under
it.
it
just
says
no
judicial
review.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
if
you
told
me...
you
know...
there's
a
real
constitutional
problem
otherwise,
i...
you
know...
i'd
stretch
a
point.
and
i'd
say
in
order
to
avoid
unconstitutionality,
you
interpret
it
that
way.
but
you're
telling
me
it
wouldn't
be...
it
would
be
perfectly
constitutional.
justice
scalia
as
applied
you
say
at
least
it's
constitutional.
justice
scalia
it
won't
always
be
the
case
that
a
drug
he
defines
is
necessarily
already
a
crime
under
the
food
and
drug
act.
