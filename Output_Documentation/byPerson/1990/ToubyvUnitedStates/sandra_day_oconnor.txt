justice
o'connor
mr.
klein,
the
scheme
adopted
by
congress
also
provides
for
some
permanent
regulations
of
schedule
1
drugs;
does
it
not?
justice
o'connor
and
the
attorney
general
plays
a
role
in
that
as
well?
justice
o'connor
and
can
also
prosecute
for
those.
now,
are
those...
do
you
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
the
permanent--
justice
o'connor
--regulations?
justice
o'connor
and
why
not?
it
seems
to
me
that
undercuts
the
position
you
take
with
regard
to
the
temporary
regulations.
justice
o'connor
and
that
gets
back
i
suppose
to
the
problem
justice
scalia
asked
you
about.
both
of
these
are
executive
functions,
and
normally
i
don't
think
we
think
of
separation
of
powers
as
distinguishing
between
executive
functions.
it's
all
the
executive
branch
whether
one,
two,
or
three
different
officials
are
involved.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case
which
i
have
to
announce
is
touby
versus
the
united
states
which
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
controlled
substances
act
which
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
identify
dangerous
new
drugs
and
add
them
to
a
list
or
schedule
of
controlled
substances.
it
takes
six
to
twelve
months
for
the
attorney
general
to
complete
the
procedures
required
to
add
a
drug
permanently
to
a
particular
schedule.
drug
traffickers
were
able
to
take
advantage
of
this
time
gap
by
developing
and
marketing
designer
drugs,
that
is
drugs
that
are
similar
in
effect
to
schedule
substances
but
differing
slightly
in
chemical
composition,
so
that
existing
schedules
did
not
apply
to
them,
long
before
the
government
was
able
to
schedule
the
new
drugs
and
initiate
prosecutions.
to
combat
the
designer
drug
problem,
congress
created
an
expedited
procedure
by
which
the
attorney
general
can
schedule
a
substance
on
a
temporary
basis
when
doing
so
is
necessary
to
avoid
an
eminent
hazard
to
the
public
safety.
pursuant
to
the
temporary
scheduling
statute
of
designer
drug
known
as
euphoria,
was
scheduled
by
the
attorney
general
as
a
controlled
substance.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
indicted
for
manufacturing
the
drug
but
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
violates
the
constitution
by
delegating
legislative
power
to
the
attorney
general.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed
the
petitionerâ€™s
convictions.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
a
temporary
scheduling
statute
does
not
delegate
legislative
power
to
the
attorney
general.
our
cases
made
clear
that
congress
may
invest
a
certain
degree
of
discretion
in
another
branch
of
government
so
long
as
it
lays
down
an
intelligible
principle
to
which
that
other
branch
must
conform.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
the
temporary
scheduling
statute,
congress
has
laid
down
an
intelligible
principle.
petitioners
argue
also
that
by
baring
judicial
review,
the
statute
makes
it
impossible
for
a
court
to
ascertain
whether
the
will
of
congress
has
been
obeyed.
we
conclude
that
the
temporary
scheduling
statute
does
not
bar
judicial
review.
it
merely
postpones
it
until
the
administrative
process
has
run
its
course.
in
addition,
the
statute
does
not
preclude
an
individual
phase
in
criminal
charges
from
bringing
a
challenge
to
a
temporary
scheduling
order
as
a
defense
to
the
prosecution.
the
petitioners
also
argued
that
the
statute
concentrates
too
much
power
in
the
attorney
general,
thereby
violating
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers.
they
conceive
that
congress
may
legitimately
authorize
someone
in
the
executive
branch
to
schedule
drugs
temporarily
but
argued
that
it
must
be
someone
other
than
the
attorney
general
because
he
wills
the
power
to
prosecute
crimes.
this
argument
has
no
basis
in
our
separation
of
powers
jurisprudence.
the
doctrine
focuses
on
the
distribution
of
powers
among
the
three
coequal
branches.
it
does
not
speak
to
the
manner
in
which
authority
is
parceled
out
within
a
single
branch.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
