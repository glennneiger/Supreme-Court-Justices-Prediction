chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
first
in
no.
90-6282,
daniel
touby
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
your
constitutional
point,
mr.
klein?
is
it
that
these
two
functions
cannot
both
be
given
within
the
executive
branch?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
authority
is
there
for
that
in
our
cases
to
say
that
there's
some
sort
of
internal
separation
of
powers'
principle
within
the
executive
branch?
i
never
heard
of
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
what
authority
is
there
in
our
cases
for
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
we
don't
have
any
adjudicatory
function
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
except
that
congress
has
always
been
able
to
delegate
some
of
those
functions
to
the
executive.
chief
justice
rehnquist
including
filling
in
the
blanks
in
criminal
statutes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
where
in...
where
in
our
cases
or
in
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
find
a
requirement
of
two
separated
judgments
like
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
have
no
case
supporting
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you've
cited,
mr.
klein,
gagnon
a
couple
of
times.
what's
the
full
name
of
that
case?
i
haven't
been
able
to
run
it
down
yet.
is
it
gagnon
against
scarpelli?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
is
it
cited
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
cited
in
your
opening
brief
i
guess.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
cabinet...
in
jackson's
administration...
the
cabinet
officer
was
removed
by
andrew
jackson
for
refusing
to
remove
the
funds
from
the
bank.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
and
he
can
get
a...
get
a
new
attorney
general,
just
like
andrew
jackson
did,
who
will
make
it
a
crime.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--gagnon
is
not
a
separation
of
powers
case
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
a
due
process
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
really
just
sounds
very,
very
mushy
to
me
to
say
that
due
process
has
an
underlying
core
of
separation
of
powers.
that's
not
just
your
melding
together
somehow
about
200
years
of
constitutional
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
do
all
eight
provisions
of
the...
of
the
first
eight
amendments.
so
does
every
provision
in
the
constitution.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
estep
pretty
much
involved
the
same
thing
under
the
selective
services
regulations,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
couldn't
challenge
it
before
you
were
inducted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--being
inducted
means
going
into
the
military,
i
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
inducted.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
can
get
judicial
review
here,
too,
of
your...
of
your...
you
can
get
the
thing
reviewed
in
your
criminal
prosecution.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
klein.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
minear.
mr.
klein,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klein.
the
case
is
submitted.
