justice
stevens
mr.
klein,
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
a
problem
that
i
haven't
quite
been
able
to
figure
out.
you've
described
this
as
a
case
in
which
the
attorney
general
is
given
the
power
to
define
a
new
crime,
in
effect.
justice
stevens
but
as
i
understand
the
food
and
drug
act,
if
this
were
a
new
drug,
and
it's
not
approved
by
the
food
and
drug
administration,
it
is
already
a
crime
to
distribute
it.
so
that
really
what
he's
able
to
do
is
not
define
a
new
crime
but
increase
the
penalties
for
an
existing
crime.
justice
stevens
i
see,
because
that
only...
the
food
and
drug
prohibition
only
attaches
the
act
of
selling--
justice
stevens
--introducing
in
the...
into
commerce.
justice
stevens
well,
then
if
that's
true,
let
me
ask
you
this
further
question.
part
of
the
government's
rationale
for
the
whole
program
is
the
emergency
that
the...
there
must
be
prompt
response
to
a
new
drug
of
this
kind.
i'm
a
little
puzzled
as
to
what
was
the
emergency
if
it
was
already
illegal?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
it's
really
a
matter
of
just
increasing
the
penalties
for
what
is
already
illegal.
justice
stevens
and
that's
the
emergency,
that
you've
got
to
have
the
stiffer
penalty
immediately.
justice
stevens
well,
you're
in
jail...
you
can
go
to
jail
for
a
year...
isn't
it
that
1
year
in
jail
is
the
punishment?
justice
stevens
has
the
court's
opinions
been
as
pristine
as
justice
scalia
would
like?
justice
stevens
so
you
have...
you're
in
good
company
at
least.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
your
theory
of
how
you
read
the
statute?
how
would
the
defendant
go
about
challenging?
would
he
file
a
motion...
a
pretrial
motion,
or
during
the
course
of
the
trial--
justice
stevens
--and
would
they
be
entitled
to
put
in
evidence
in
support
of
that
motion?
is
that
your
view?
justice
stevens
they
could
put
the
whole
record
in,
get
into
arguments
about
the
procedures
that
were
followed
in
the...
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
likely
kind
of
thing
you
might--
justice
stevens
--it
occurs
to
me
that
perhaps
you're
inviting
some
protracted
proceedings
in
advance
of
trial
in
a
lot
of
criminal
cases
in
these
things.
justice
stevens
and
if
the
judge
should
dismiss
an
indictment,
i
gather
you
can
appeal
that,
can't
you?
justice
stevens
you
can
appeal
an
order
dismissing
the
indictment.
justice
stevens
you're
saying
it
really
means
it's
not
subject
to
judicial
review
under
the
provisions
of
this
statute.
justice
stevens
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review...
an
order
issued
under
paragraph
1
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
stevens
and
you
say
except
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
stevens
the
difference
would
be
that
there
they
at
least
allow
judicial
review
for
a
stated
period
of
time.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
go
back
for
a
second.
justice
stevens
what
is
your
authority
for
the
proposition
that
if
you
read
the
statute
the
way
your
opponent
does,
it
clearly
would
be
constitutional?
justice
stevens
the
yakus
is
the
closest
you
get.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
your
position
is
just
as
novel
as
your
opponents
in
this
particular
issue.
justice
stevens
i'm
not
saying
that,
but
you
don't
have
the
case
on
the
nose
and
neither
does
he.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
question,
how
far
down
the
line
could
he
delegate?
if
you
read
the
statute
literally,
could
he
give
the
power
to
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
or
to
a
secretary
or
to
a
research
assistant
or
somebody
like
that?
justice
stevens
you
say
it
would
have
to
be
an
officer
of
the
united
states?
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
but
you
think
there's
an
implied
limit
on
what
the
statute
seems
to
say
on
its
face?
