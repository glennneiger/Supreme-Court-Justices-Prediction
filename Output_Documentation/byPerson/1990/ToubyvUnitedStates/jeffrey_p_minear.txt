mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
clarifying
the
point
that
you
just
discussed
with
mr.
klein,
justice
stevens.
in
fact,
this...
this
activity
would
be
illegal
under
section
360
for
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
because
that
requires
any
manufacturer
to
register
with
the
fda
before
engaging
in
any
manufacture.
so
in
fact,
there
would
be
a
violation.
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law
in
any
event.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
part
of
the
problem
here...
it's
perhaps
best,
your
honor,
to
explain
exactly
how
these
situations
arise.
what
normally
happens
is
a
drug
enforcement
investigation
leads
to
the
seizure
of
a
drug
laboratory.
upon
examination
of
the
materials
in
the
drug
laboratory,
they
find
that
the
person
is
selling
particular
drugs.
that
person
might
be
selling
these
drugs
as
amphetamines
or
speed
or
some
other
drugs
that
are
controlled.
in
fact,
a
further
review
reveals
that
these
drugs
are
in
fact
a...
they
mimic
the
dangerous
effects
of
that
drug,
that
they
are
not
in
fact
controlled.
at
that
point,
the
dea
makes
a
determination
whether
they
should
seek
to
further
control
those
drugs,
to
place
them
on
the
list.
and
at
that...
in
that
manner
be
able
to
apply
the
full
force
of
the
criminal
law
against
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--largely
that
is
what
the
effect
of
this
is.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
because
otherwise
the
misdemeanor
penalty
is
simply
not
sufficient
material
for--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that's
right.
that's
simply
not
enough
to
deter
this
type
of
activity,
which
can
be
very,
very
remunerative
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
made
on
those
types
of
sales.
congress
enacted
section
201(h)
of
the
controlled
substances
act
to
deal
with
the
serious
health
problem.
illicit
drug
dealers
attempt
to
avoid
laws
prohibiting
the
controlled
substances
act
or
to
attempt
to
avoid
laws
prohibiting
the
sale
of
controlled
substances
by
producing
and
selling
drugs
such
as
euphoria
involved
in
this
case.
it
mimics
the
dangerous
effects
of
a
controlled
substance,
but
is
not
listed
as
such.
section
201(h)
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
take
prompt
action
to
protect
the
public
with
the
dangers
associated
with
the
misdirected
creativity
of
these
underground
chemists.
if
the
attorney
general
finds
that
the
unlisted
drug
poses
an
imminent
hazard
to
the
public
safety,
it
has
no
approved
medical
use,
he
may
list
that
drug
as
a
schedule
1
controlled
substance
for
as
long
as
18
months
while
he
completes
the
permanent
listing
process.
now,
petitioners
acknowledge
that
congress
has
authority
to
protect
the
public
health
through
some
mechanism
allowing
the
executive
branch
to
list
eight
dangerous
drugs
on
an
emergency
basis.
they
argue,
however,
that
congress'
use
of
the
attorney
general
to
effect
that
result
is
an
unlawful
delegation
of
legislative
power.
petitioners
concede
that
section
201(h)
lays
down
intelligible
principles
that
guide
the
attorney
general's
exercise
of
emergency
listing
discretion.
that
concession,
we
submit,
should
resolve
the
delegation
issue.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
congress
does
not
delegate
legislative
power
as
the
constitution
uses
that
term.
or
it
gives
an
executive
branch
official
discretion
to
define
unlawful
conduct
and
also
lays
down
guidelines
that
channel
the
executive
branch
officials
exercise
of
that
discretion.
the
reason
for
this
is
clear.
congress
can
enact
laws
whose
application
depends
on
the
satisfaction
of
certain
conditions,
and
then
give
the
executive
branch
official
the
task
of
determining
whether
those
conditions
have
been
satisfied.
the
executive
branch
official
does
not
in
that
situation
exercise
legislative
power.
he's
not
making
law
subject
only
to
constitutional
limits
in
electoral
accountability.
rather
he's
executing
congress'
will.
the
task
of
determining
whether
a
law
should
apply
to
particular
facts
is
simply
one
aspect
of
executing
that
law.
congress
must
of
course
give
the
executive
branch
intelligible
direction
to
ensure
the
executive
is
executing
congress'
will
rather
than
exercising
de
facto
legislative
power.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is...
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
now,
as
you
have
heard,
petitioners
concede
that
section
201(h)
amply
satisfies
the
intelligible
principle
test.
they
nevertheless
argue
that
section
201(h)
is
unconstitutional
delegation
of
legislative
power,
because
congress
has
given
the
attorney
general
rather
than
some
other
executive
branch
official
the
power
to
list
dangerous
drugs.
you
would
make
that
usage
more
common
if
you
wouldn't
refer
to
it
as
an
unconstitutional
delegation
of
legislative
power.
if
you
just
said
it's
a
delegation
of
legislative
power.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
afraid
that
it's
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized,
the
constitution
divides
government
power
into
three
co-equal
branches
of
government.
it
does
not
dictate
how
congress
might
assign
responsibilities
within
the
executive
branch.
rather
congress'
broad
authority
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
select
the
president
or
one
of
his
subordinates
to
perform
an
executive
function.
there's
no
constitutional
requirement
that
congress
vulcanize
the
executive
branch's
regulatory
and
prosecutory
functions.
in
this
instance,
congress
gave
the
attorney
general
responsibility
for
temporarily
listing
dangerous
drugs,
because
it
determined
that
he's
best
situated
to
respond
promptly
and
effectively
to
the
public
health
threat.
certainly
congress
entitled...
is
entitled
to
make
that
determination.
as
i
explained
before,
these
enforcement...
the
listing
is
usually
preceded
by
enforcement
action
that
leads
to
the
discovery
of
these
drugs.
now,
congress'
decision
to
give
the
attorney
general
both
regulatory
and
prosecutive
functions
is
not,
as
petitioners
suggested
in
their
opening
brief,
entirely
unprecedented.
congress
has
given
the
attorney
general
criminal
enforcement
power
in
all
three
of
the
basic
areas
where
the
attorney
general
has
regulatory
responsibilities.
in
the
case
of
controlled
substances,
the
attorney
general
plays
the
principal
role
in
the
permanent
listing
decision...
even
in
the
case
of
drugs
that
have
medical
uses.
in
the
case
of
prisons,
the
attorney
general
has
authority
to
regulate
the
introduction
of
anything
whatsoever
into
prison
and
to
punish
violations,
including
violations
by
people
who
are
not
prisoners
and
not
subject
to
the
attorney
general's
custodial
responsibilities.
now,
the
attorney
general
has
exercised
that
authority
since
at
least
1948,
and
it
has
withstood
repeated
delegation
challenges.
in
the
case
of
immigration,
it's
a
crime
to
bring
aliens
into
this
country
at
locations
other
than
designated
ports
of
entry.
now,
the
attorney
general
has
authority
to
designate
ports
of
entry
under
8
u.s.c.
1229.
he
has
delegated
that
authority
to
the
commissioner
of
the
ins.
what
we
see
here
really
is
that
in
any
case
where
the
attorney
general
has
regulatory
responsibilities,
he
also
has
prosecutorial
responsibilities
as
well.
indeed,
what
is
unprecedented
in
here
is
petitioners'
extraordinary
approach
to
what
constitutes
an
unlawful
delegation.
under
petitioners'
view,
the
question
would
turn
not
on
the
proper
relationship
between
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch,
but
rather
on
whether
a
given
executive
branch
official,
in
this
case
the
attorney
general,
is
the
appropriate
person
to
administer
prisons,
to
determine
lawful
ports
of
entry
for
aliens,
or
to
designate
dangerous
drugs.
petitioners
also
contend
that
section
201(h)
violates
separation
of
powers,
because
the
section
does
not
provide
for
judicial
review
of
the
attorney
general's
temporary
listing
decisions.
that
argument
however
is
incorrect.
section
507,
the
controlled
substances
act,
contains
special
provisions
for
judicial
review
which
may
be
invoked
upon
permanent
listing
of
the
substance.
section
201(h)(6)
prevents
and
individual
from
invoking
those
provisions
until
completion
of
the
permanent
listing
decision.
but
even
then
it
does
not
prevent
an
individual
who
is
prosecuted
in
the
interim
from
obtaining
judicial
oversight
of
the
attorney
general's
action
in
the
enforcement
proceeding.
in
this
case,
petitioners
challenged
only
the
constitutionality
of
section
201(h)--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
you
would
file
a
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
in
this
case,
they
filed
a
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
section
201(h)
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
they
would.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
excuse
me,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think
what
would
happen
in
these
cases
is
that
we
would
rely
on
the
administrative
record
that
was
compiled
for
the
emergency
listing.
the
review
of
that
would
be
a
question
of
whether
the
listing
of
this
drug
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
we'd
apply
the
same
apa
standard
in
that
case.
we
are
quite
confident
that
our
record
is
such
that
we
would
have
little
difficulty
in
winning
this...
these...
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
we
would
appeal.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
now,
as
i
said
in
this
case
the
petitioners
could
have
challenged
the
listing
of
euphoria
in
this
particular
case,
but
they
chose
simply
not
to
do
that.
they
say--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--our
construction
of
the
statute
is
as
follows.
it
precludes...
section
201(h)(6)
says...
states
that
there
shall
be
no
judicial
review
of
any
order
of
the
attorney
general.
that
reference
to
judicial
review
we
believe
applies
to
the
specific
judicial
review
provisions
of
the
act
containing
section
507.
in
other
words,
it
prevents
a
party
from
seeking
review
under
section
507
of
the
controlled
substances
act.
but
it
does
not
prevent
a
party
from
raising
a
challenge
as
a
defense
to
their
prosecution.
now,
it
might
be...
you
find
in
cases
that
raising
the
challenge
in
the
enforcement
proceeding
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
judicial
review.
but
normally
judicial
review
is
conceived
of
as
an
action
that's
initiated
to
challenge
agency
action
rather
than
a
defense
to
a
prosecution.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
says
there
shall
be
no
judicial
review.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
we
would
say
that
in
a
case
of
criminal
proceeding
it's
a
different
situation
where
you're
allowed
to
raise
that
as
a
defense.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
is
section
507,
which
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--21
u.s.c.
877
is
the
statutory--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
i
believe
it
is
summarized
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
however.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
21
u.s.c.
877.
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
able
to
find
it.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
now,
there's
nothing
unusual
in
challenging
agency
action
in
a
criminal
enforcement
proceeding.
and
indeed,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
one
could
often
challenge
administrative
determination
only
in
the
course
of
an
administrative...
or
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
bridge
cases
that
we
cite,
cases
like
union
bridge
and
the
monongahela
bridge
accompanied.
both
involve
that
situation
where
there's
a
administrative
determination
that
was
challenged
in
the
criminal
enforcement
action.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
in
fact,
the
apa
recognizes
that.
and
section
703
of
the
apa
states
that
unless
the
specific
provision
provided
precludes
that
type
of
challenge,
it
is
permissible.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right.
and
if
in
fact
this
was...
if
section
201(h)(6)
were
interpreted
to
preclude
and
it
review...
even
in
an
enforcement
proceeding...
then
this
case
would
be
very
much
like
yakus.
now,
in
yakus--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
at
some
point
after
the
criminal
enforcement
proceeding,
as
in
here.
if
you
look
to
yakus
at...
i
believe
it
would
be
at
321
u.s.,
page
436,
there's
a
discussion
of
this.
the
same
discussion
is
made
in
bowles
v.
willingham,
which
is...
also
appears
in
that
volume
of
u.s.
reports.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
no.
this
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
in
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
believe
this
is
the
best
reading
of
the
statute
in
light
of
the
guidance
this
court
has
given
it
in
interpreting
judicial
review
provisions.
this
court
is
hesitant
to
conclude
that
judicial
review
has
been
completely
precluded.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct,
and
if
the
court
wished
to
read
the
statute
like
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
believe
it
would
still
be
constitutional,
and
for
this
reason.
the
activity
that
these
parties
are
engaged
in
is
illegal
already.
there
is
no
real
due
process
limitation,
or
no
liberty
interest
that's
being...
that
needs
to
be
protected
here
under
the
due
process--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think
we
can
presume
that
it...
that
we're
entitled
to
that
presumption
in
determining
the
constitution...
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that
they...
that
he
would
act
properly
under
the
statute.
now,
in
fact,
in
yakus,
i
should
point
out--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
first
would
be
the...
the
yakus.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
yakus
is
the
closest
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
worth
pointing
out
though,
however,
that
in
some
cases
there
certainly
can
be
delegations
of
executive
power
for
which
there
is
no
judicial
review.
the
apa
recognizes
that.
some
cases
have
in
fact
recognized
that
as
well.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
do...
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is...
i
think
that
we
have...
certainly
have
much
stronger
case
support
than
they
do.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
in
sum,
petitioners
had
more
than
ample
opportunity
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
the
government's
decision
to
list
euphoria
as
a
schedule
1
controlled
substance.
their
failure
to
challenge
the
government's
decision,
either
after
completion
of
the
administrative
proceeding
or
in
the
enforcement
proceeding,
simply
underscores
the
lawfulness
of
the
government's
action.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
points
that
were
raised
in
the
opening
argument.
one,
petitioners
note
that
there
have
been
suggestions
in
the
executive
branch
that
there
should
be
some
division
of
executive
and
prosecutive
and
regulatory
powers.
we've
made
those
suggestions
as
a
policy
matter
and
not
as
a
constitutional
matter.
this
is
a
constitutional
issue
that's
posed
here.
with
respect
to
gagnon
v.
scarpelli,
i
think
the
more...
the
more
compelling
precedent
would
be
withrow
v.
larkin.
in
that
case,
this
court
noted
that,
as
a
general
matter,
there
is
not
facially
violative
of
due
process
to
combine
both
a
prosecutorial
and
an
adjudicative
function.
it
indicated
it
might
be
unconstitutional
in
certain
factual
situations
and
explained
cases
like
gagnon
on
that
basis.
here
we
do
not
have
a
combination
of
the
prosecution
in
adjudicatory
function.
instead,
it's
simply
the
regulatory
and
prosecutive
function
instead.
also,
i'd
like
to
reemphasize
the
point
that
was
made
in
argument
that
the
petitioners'
reliance
on
the
abbott
lab
case
is
really
misplaced
here.
that
was
a
statutory...
in
case
of
statutory
interpretation.
the
due
process
principles
that
were
applicable
in
this
area
were
set
forth
in
the
ewing
case
that
was
decided
before
that
time.
and
then
finally
i
think
it's...
i
should
mention
the
subdelegation
issue.
petitioners
also
contend
that
the
attorney
general
lacks
statutory
authority
to
delegate
his
section
201
responsibilities
to
the
administrator
of
the
drug
enforcement
agency.
congress,
however,
is
authorized
that
subdelegation
in
two
separate
statutes.
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
indication
in
either
of
those
statutes
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
section
201(h)
from
subdelegation.
the
attorney
general
accordingly
has
ample
statutory
authority
to
delegate
his
temporary
listing
responsibilities
to
the
administrator
of
dea.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we...
we
think
under
buckley
v.
valeo
this
would
have
to
be
exercised
by
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
now
the
administrator
of
the
dea
is
obviously
an
officer
of
the
united
states
and
that
would
dispose
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
the
statute
does
not
say
that.
but
again
the
delegation
provision
here
is
a
general
delegation
provision
covering
the
statute
at
large.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
so
there
certainly
could
be
responsibilities
that
could
be
delegated
to
employees.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
there
might
be
a
constitutional
limit
on
that,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
not
aware
of
any
challenge
to
that.
i
would
also
point
out
that
in...
for
instance
in
36
c.f.r.,
the
department
of
interior
has
created
an
entire
criminal
code
for
the
national
parks,
where
various...
all
sorts
of
infractions
violate
the
law.
and
there's
never
been
any
challenge
to
my
knowledge
to
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
that
would
depend
on
a
question
of
whether
there's
an
intelligible
principle
that
has
been
stated
there.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
we
might...
well,
the
broader
the
delegation
i
think
the
more
insistent
we
are
that
there
be
a
clear...
a
clear
indication
of
an
intelligible
principle.
here
the
intelligible
principles
are
very
precise.
there's
no
challenge
to
them
whatsoever
in
this
case.
however,
in
some...
in
the
extreme
case
i
think
we
can
demand
more
from
congress
in
terms
of
intelligible
principles
the
broader
the...
the
delegation
authority
might
be.
if
there
are
no
further
questions...
thank
you.
