justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
on
it?
supposing
you
had
a
case,
and
i
am
sure
there
must
be
many
of
these,
in
which
there
was
never
an
argument
of
procedural
default,
but
there's
just
an
argument
about
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim.
and
the
court
of
appeal
wrote
a
long
opinion
denying
the
claim
on
the
merits.
and
the
petitioner
thereafter
went
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
filed
an
original
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
would
the
entry
of
that
order
be
a
judgment
that
would
be
reviewable
in
this
court,
or
would
it
then
have
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stevens
under
the
theory
that
it
is
the
final
judgment?
justice
stevens
what...
just
a
minute.
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
you.
first,
if
it
had
been
a
petition
for
review
as
distinguished
from
a
habeas
corpus,
then
our
review
would
be
of
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
would
it
not?
justice
stevens
right,
i
understand.
justice
stevens
but
now
my
other
hypothetical,
the
case
like
this
one,
where
it's
an
original
petition
for
habeas,
then
would
not
our
review
be
of
the
california
supreme
court's
action?
justice
stevens
well,
we
only
have
jurisdiction
if
it's
a
final
judgment.
justice
stevens
that's
why
we
couldn't
review
the
discretionary
one.
justice
stevens
but
you
think
we
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
original
habeas?
justice
stevens
well,
we
review
judgments,
not
opinions
and
so
forth,
and
it's
a
particular
order
that
would
give
us
jurisdiction.
and
in
one
case
it's
the
earlier
order
and
the
other
case
it's
the
later
order.
justice
stevens
no.
i
just
interrupt
a
minute?
i'm
trying
to
think
out
through
the
workload
problem
for
the
judge.
and
you're
telling
me
that
there
are
cases
where
it's
not
clear
on
the
face
of
the
court...
i
assume
they
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
they're
asked
to
review
before
they
act
on
these
petitions.
and
you're
telling
me
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
where
they
can't
tell
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
acted
on
a
procedural
default
ground
or
some
other
ground.
and
how
do
we
know,
then,
that
it's
going
to
be
any
easier
for
the
federal
district
court,
who
has
the
same
problem,
when
the
petitioner
files
that
complaint?
it
seems
to
me
if
it
is
clear
they
could
very
simply
say
this
is...
as
you
say
it
is
in
this
case,
just
entered
a
one-line
order.
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
it's
plain.
i
mean,
if
it
is
plain
on
the
face
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
what
is
the
burden
on
the
justice
of
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
stevens
well--
justice
stevens
--well,
why
is
there...
if
their
basis
is
there
was
a
procedural
default
and
they're
going
to
rely
on
that
ground
in
the
same
kind
of
order
they
use
now,
why
can't
they
just
add
the
words
for
grounds
of
procedural
default?
justice
stevens
they
would
look
at
the
same
documents
that
the
district
judge
will
look
at
later
on,
don't
they?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
to
be
sure
i...
are
you
telling
us
that
they
do
or
do
not
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
before
them?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
what...
do
you
think
harris
against
reed
applies
to
the
direct
review
procedure?
justice
stevens
well,
then
you're
saying
it
really
doesn't
apply
in
the
same
way
it
applies
in
the...
in
the
original
habeas.
in
other
words,
if
this
had
been
a
direct
review
petition
to
the
california
supreme
court
with
just
a
denial
without
any
explanation,
would
we
look
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
would
we
say
there
is
no
compliance
with
harris
and
therefore
we
have...
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand.
i'm
asking
about
the
other.
justice
stevens
i
know
it
makes
more
sense,
but
what's
your
position
on
that?
would
you...
i
know
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
decide
it,
but
i
think
your
opponent
is
probably
as
much
concerned
about
that
as
this
issue.
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
so
you
do
draw
a
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
stevens
but
the
reason
for
that
was
the
fact
he
had
another
claim,
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
as
well
as
the
miranda
claim,
isn't
it?
there
was
a
concern
as
to
whether
that
had
been
exhausted.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
maybe
this
is
off
the
wall,
but
supposing
the
district
judge
was
persuaded
there
was...
that
they
may
well
have
acted
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
adopted
your
position,
but
looked
at
the
record
in
the
trial
court
and
thought
well,
by
golly,
this
defendant
certainly
should
have
objected
to
this
evidence
and
didn't
do
so.
could
he
as
a
matter...
could
the
district
judge
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
decide
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
claim?
justice
stevens
it's
really
not
jurisdictional
either
way.
if
there
is
cause
and
prejudice
he
can
go
ahead
with
it,
but
supposing
there's
neither
the
traditional
cause
nor
prejudice
argument,
but
he
thinks
the
last
state
court
waived
the
procedural
default
and
addressed
the
merits.
could
he
say
i
don't
think
i
even
have
to
reach
the
merits
because
it's
so
clear
to
me
that
this
argument
was
waived
by
the
failure
to
make
an
objection
in
the
trial
court?
justice
stevens
i
know
that's
what
most
of
these
opinions
say,
but
i
have
never
been
sure
that
made
all
that
much
sense.
