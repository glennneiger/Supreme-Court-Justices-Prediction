william
h.

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-68,
eddie
s.
ylst
v.
owen
duane
nunnemaker.
mr.
thompson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
speak
up
a
little,
mr.
thompson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
these
were
petitions
for
habeas
corpus?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
thompson,
as
i
understand
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeal,
it
was
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
supreme
court
of
california,
which
denied
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
without
opinion
in
this
case,
does
on
occasion
grant
review
of
otherwise
defaulted
claims
where
there's
an
original
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
and
so
you
can't
say
flatly
that
a
denial
of
the
writ
is
based
on
procedural
grounds.
chief
justice
rehnquist
these
are
summary
denials
of
habeas?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
jurisdiction
in
mandatory?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say--
--where
do
we
look
when
a
petition
denied
order
from
the
california
supreme
court
in
an
original
habeas
case
cannot
possibly
mean
that
they
considered
the
merits,
found
them
wanting,
and
therefore
denied
it
for
that
reason?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
including
possible
lack
of
merit?
in
this
case
possible
lack
of
merit
to
the
miranda
claim?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
substantially
like
a
denial
of
hearing
on
a
petition
for
hearing
from
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
exactly?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
thompson.
ms.
drous,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
part
about
habeas
was
dicta,
was
it
not?
or
the
part
where...
in
the
part
where
it
said
if
the
last
opinion
on
the
merits,
and
that...
because
what
we
were
dealing
with
there
was
an
opinion
from
the
illinois
appellate
court
which
treated
both
the
merits
and
procedural
default.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
answering
the
question
whether
that
was
dicta
or
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
it
may
be
dicta,
but
if
it
was
dicta
it
was...
it
was
good
dicta
and
it
ought
to
be
adhered
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
drous,
i
think
it's
easy
to
underestimate
that
burden.
i
wonder
how
we
would
do
in
our
processing
of
4,500
petitions
for
certiorari
every
year
if
we
had
to
give
an
explanation
as
to
why
we...
when
we
were
denying
for
an
issue
that
wasn't
properly
preserved
below.
lots
of
times
you
just
don't
get
into
quite
that
amount
of
specificity
when
you're
exercising
discretionary
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
it's
likely
that
the
chief
justice
would
put
out
a
book
about
procedures
that
the
other
members
of
the
court
didn't
agree
with?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
dealing
with
the
petition
for
hearing
in
the
normal
course
of
direct
review?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
really
my
point.
that
when
you're
talking
about
the
supreme
court
of
california
reviewing
an...
a
decision
below,
that's
the
process
of
a
petition
for
hearing,
isn't
it,
after
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--petition
for
review?
chief
justice
rehnquist
your...
i
would
think
your
answer
would
be,
in
the
case
of
the
amendment
that
justice
scalia
talked
to
you
about,
that
even
though
it
were
completely
discretionary,
so
long
as
the
california
supreme
court
could
possibly
consider
a
default
and
claim
on
the
merits,
harris
against
reed
wouldn't
be
satisfied.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
about
when
the
supreme
court
of
california
denies
review
but
directs
depublication,
or
whatever
the
phrase
is
in
california?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
hardship
to
your
client
of
having
a
rule
that
would
say
in
a
case
like
this
there
the
last
court
in
the...
california
to
pass
on
the
merits
of
this
claim
said
it
was
procedurally
defaulted.
every
other
thing
has
been
simply
a
blind
denial
without
any
opinion.
in
that
case
the
last
opinion
on
the
merits
controls.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
get
any
of
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
what
would
be
the
hardship
to
people
in
your
client's
position
of
having
a
rule
as
to
exhaustion
that
said
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
last
opinion
in
the
california
court
system
was
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal
saying
there
had
been
a
procedural
default
and
every
subsequent
proceeding
has
been
simply
a
blind
denial
without
opinion
of
relief,
that
it's
that
last
opinion
dealing
with
the
merits
that
controls,
and
therefore
there
has
been
a
procedural
default?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
no--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--presumably...
what
would
be
the
hardship
to
your
client
in
this
court
adopting
a
rule
such
as
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
one
of
the
blind
denials
from
the
california
appellate
courts
might
have
been
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does...
the
california
supreme
court
gets
what,
700
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
a
year?
chief
justice
rehnquist
some...
oh...
that
order
of...
in
how
many
of
those
does
it
grant
relief
typically
in
a
year?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
give
me
some
order
of
magnitude?
5?
10?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
drous.
mr.
thompson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
i
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thompson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
