ms.
juliana
drous
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
developed
a
bright-line
rule
in
harris
v.
reed
instructing
federal
courts
as
to
how
to
quickly
determine
if
in
fact
a
procedural
default
was
relied
upon
in
the
denial
of
a
habeas
or
in
the
state
court.
ms.
juliana
drous
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
first,
the
question
presented
in
harris
v.
reed
was
when
you
have
an
ambiguous
order,
what
do
you
do.
and
i
would
submit
that
a
silent
order
is
an
ambiguous
order.
second--
ms.
juliana
drous
--yes.
second,
i
would
answer
that
if
it
is
dicta,
it's
very
well
reasoned.
in
reviewing
the
harris
v.
reed
oral
argument
transcript,
i
noted
that
justices
specifically
asked
questions
regarding
a
silent
denial.
and
i
am
assuming
that
that
footnote
came
from
the
responses
to
those
questions.
ms.
juliana
drous
absolutely.
absolutely,
your
honor.
it
puzzles
me
as
to
where
the
burden,
the
additional
burden
will
come
to
the
state
courts
to
provide
two
words
on
a
denial,
to
tell
the
federal
courts
when
a
procedural
default
was
relied
on.
ms.
juliana
drous
well,
first
of
all...
the
question
here
should
be
what
kind
of
discretion
is
exercised
by
the
california
supreme
court.
i
would
note,
first
of
all,
that
this
court
is
in
a
very
different
position
than
the
california
supreme
court.
you
are,
after
all,
the
court
of
last
resort,
and
after
you
rule,
that's
it.
the
california
supreme
court
knows
that
when
it
denies
a
federal...
excuse
me,
a
state
habease
petition,
that
more
than
likely
that
petitioner
will
move
on
to
federal
court,
and
what
the
supreme
court
does
is
relevant
as
to
what
is
going
to
happen
next.
second
of
all,
as
to
the
burden,
the
state
seems
to
argue
here
that
its
position
would
not
apply
on
death
penalty
cases,
so
we
are
not
talking
about
the
cases
that
are
the
most
troublesome
to
the
california
supreme
court.
and
so
no
burden
would
be
lessened
there.
in
fact,
when
you
look
at
the
statutes
in
california,
i
would
first
state
that
this
pamphlet
relied
upon
is
simply
a
pamphlet
that
is
given
to
the
public
in
the
most
basic
terms
to
explain
what
the
california
supreme
court
does,
and
it
is
not
signed...
the
introduction
in
fact
is
signed
by
justice
lucas,
but
it
is
not
signed
by
any
other
justice
and
we
do
not
know
if
in
fact
the
other
justices
agree
with
this.
i
would
also
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
way
that
either
the
state--
ms.
juliana
drous
--well,
let
me...
the
passage
relied
on
here
as
to
the
different
cases
that
the
california
supreme
court
deals
with,
it's
true
that
in
death
penalty
cases
and
in
a
few
other
situations
the
court
must
render
a
written
opinion,
and
it's
true
that
there
is
discretion
to
be
exercised
regarding
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
a
petition
for
review.
but
it's
also
true
that
the
two
procedures
are
treated
totally
differently
in
california.
first
of
all,
the
california
supreme
court
has
a
separate
section
of
lawyers,
researchers,
to
deal
only
with
petitions
for
habeas
corpus.
griggs
v.
superior
court
very
clearly
states
that
when
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
filed
in
the
california
supreme
court
the
merits
have
to
be
looked
at.
the
language...
there
are
different
sections
of
the
constitution
dealing
with
habeas
and
with
petitions
for
review.
ms.
juliana
drous
it
does
not,
but
there's
a
reason
for
that.
there
is
no
case
out
of
the
california
supreme
court
which
says
whether
or
not
a
decision
denying
habeas
relief
is
a
decision
on
the
merits.
ms.
juliana
drous
well,
let
me
get
back
to
that.
the
discretion
that
they're
talking
about
in
habeas
is
different
than
the
discretion
that
is
exercised
in
a
petition
for
review.
first
of
all,
when
a
petition
for
review
comes
before
the
california
supreme
court
it
comes
up
with
two
numbers.
it
comes
up
with
the
california
supreme
court
number,
and
the
number
from
the
case
below,
indicating
that
it
is
one
case.
and
what
the
court
is
doing
there
is
simply
reviewing
the
opinion
from
the
court
of
appeal
to
determine
if
a
hearing,
if
review
is
proper.
the...
article
vi,
section
12
of
the
california
constitution
very
specifically
states
that
the
supreme
court
may...
clearly
granting
discretion...
review
the
decision
of
a
court
of
appeal
in
any
case.
when
you
look
to
the
language
regarding--
ms.
juliana
drous
--no,
your
honor.
they
are
different
proceedings.
when
the
habeas...
when
the
original
habeas
corpus
petition
is
filed,
what
the
supreme
court
does...
that
is
not
a
review
of
the
opinion
below.
first
of
all,
you
must
note
that
one
of
the
main
reasons--
ms.
juliana
drous
--correct.
except
now
it's
called
the
petition
for
review.
ms.
juliana
drous
but
that's
correct.
correct,
your
honor.
and
when
you
look
at
the
language
dealing
with
the
california
supreme
court's
original
jurisdiction
in
habeas,
there
is
no
word
"may".
the
words
are
"required",
as
in
gonzales,
as
in
people-gonzales,
which
was
recently
decided
and
which
was
a
death
penalty
case.
i
believe
it's
51
cal.
3d.
v.
lawler.
"must"...
i'm
sorry,
it's
in
re
lawler.
"must",
as
in
in
re
hochberg.
there
is
no
"may".
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
ms.
juliana
drous
in
california
it's
never
dismissed.
it's
always
denied.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
fact,
petitioner--
ms.
juliana
drous
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
fact--
ms.
juliana
drous
--absolutely.
ms.
juliana
drous
absolutely.
in
fact
there
have
been
petitions
for
certiorari
from
such
a
denial,
as
i
noted
in
my
brief,
and
this
court
did
deny
certiorari.
however,
two
justices
felt
that
certiorari
should
be
granted,
and
if
certiorari
was
granted
it
would
run
to
the
supreme
court.
well,
if
it's
a
petition
for
review
and
this
court
grants
certiorari,
the
certiorari
runs
not
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
it
runs
to
the
court
of
appeal.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
ms.
juliana
drous
yes.
and
the--
ms.
juliana
drous
--that's
correct,
but
you
have...
there's
another...
what
discretion
is
exercised.
there
is
discretion
to
be
exercised
in
a
petition
for
habeas.
for
example
if
a
procedural
default
is
found,
there
is
discretion
to
forgive
that
procedural
default.
interestingly
enough,
in
the
past
the
california
supreme
court,
and
i
can
cite
to
you...
these
are
in
the
brief...
at
least
five
cases
right
now
where
the
california
supreme
court
and
one
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
found
a
procedural
default,
forgave
the
default,
and
then
denied
on
the
merits
or
granted
on
the
merits.
ms.
juliana
drous
the
california--
ms.
juliana
drous
--the
california
supreme
court
does
not
have
that
absolute
discretion
to
ignore
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
filed
in
its
office.
ms.
juliana
drous
the--
ms.
juliana
drous
--correct.
lawler,
hochberg.
also,
it's...
what
the
supreme...
the
supreme
court
has
noted
this
in
its
actions.
behavior
speaks
louder
than
words.
in
approximately
40
percent
of
the
cases
where
an
original
petition
for
habeas
review
is
filed,
the
california
supreme
court
in
fact,
when
it
denies,
denies
with
citations
either
for
exhaustion
or
failure...
or
procedural
default.
that
does
not
happen...
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
california
supreme
court
did
that
in
a
denial
of
review
of
a
court
of
appeal
opinion.
which
also--
ms.
juliana
drous
--it
uses
the
same
word.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
ninth
circuit
itself
has
noted
that.
i
have
under...
i
heard
that
the...
california
wants
california
law
to
be
treated
the
way
idaho
law
is,
and
i
believe
it's
oregon
law
in
the
other
case.
however,
in
ninth
circuit
opinions
the
ninth
circuit
has
noted
that
in
those
states
original
jurisdiction
in
habeas
corpus
is
rarely
used,
which
is
very
different
than
in
california.
ms.
juliana
drous
i
don't
think
in
a
very
searching
way.
i
think
that
that
determination
would--
ms.
juliana
drous
--i
believe
that
you
have,
and
i
know
the
ninth
circuit
has.
ms.
juliana
drous
and
it
will,
and
it
does.
ms.
juliana
drous
well,
the...
the
courts--
ms.
juliana
drous
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the...
that
it--
ms.
juliana
drous
--no,
because
that's
only
the
first
step.
that
would
only
be
the
first
step.
in--
ms.
juliana
drous
--i
believe
that.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
i
believe
what
you
have
here
is
someone,
someone
has
to
decide
whether
a
procedural...
a
state
procedural
default
will
bar
federal
review.
that
is
state
law,
state
procedure.
the
entity
that
is
best
suited
to
decide
that
is
the
state
court,
and
the
state
court
does
decide
that.
and
all
that
harris
v.
reed
requires
is
the
state
court
to
state
so.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
i
would
have
another
question,
and
that
is
if
there
is
no
difference
in
the
procedure
of
petition
for
review
and
original...
and
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
court,
why
do
we
have
it.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct,
your
honor.
harris
v.
reed
is
an
easy
rule
to
follow.
ms.
juliana
drous
it
does
reply...
apply
to
the
direct
review
procedure.
however,
in
the
direct
review
procedure
the
denial
has
to
be
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
opinion
from
the
court
of
appeal.
ms.
juliana
drous
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
well,
it
would
make
no
sense
in
looking
at
california
law
to
go
to
any
prior
proceeding
in
determining
what
the
state
court
meant
in
its
denial
of
an
original
petition.
it
does
make
more
sense--
ms.
juliana
drous
--no,
it
makes
more
sense
to
do
that--
ms.
juliana
drous
--i
think
the
ninth
circuit
did
clearly
state...
made
a
distinction
between
the
petition
for
review
procedure
and
the
original
petition
procedure.
and
in
the
petition
for
review,
because
it
has
two
case
numbers,
and
the
petition
for
review
clearly
relates
back
to
the
opinion,
that
looking
to
the
opinion
as
the
last
judgment
would
be
proper.
ms.
juliana
drous
but
when
you
have
a
denial
of
original
habeas
corpus--
ms.
juliana
drous
--yes,
i
would.
i
would.
because
in...
when
you
have
a
denial
of
original
habeas
corpus
you
do
not
know
that
in
fact
whatever
happened
in
the
court
of
appeal
was
relied
on
in
that
denial.
what
this
ignores
is
the
fact...
the
use
of
the
habeas
is
primarily
to
bring
new
facts
before
the
court.
ms.
juliana
drous
that...
denying...
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
petition
for
review
procedure
to
that
instant
case.
the
only
thing
of...
depublishing
the
opinion,
that
just
means
that
other
people
can't
rely
on
that
opinion
in
arguing
law.
so
as
to
the
effect
on
that
specific
case,
that
really
makes
no
difference.
ms.
juliana
drous
not
in
that
individual
case.
ms.
juliana
drous
but
in
an
unrelated
case
you
cannot
cite
back
to
it
because
it
is
no
longer
law.
california's
procedure
is
unique.
it
makes
no
sense
to
argue...
harris
v.
superior
court,
cited
by
the
ninth
circuit
some
time
ago,
found
that
a
denial
without
comment
is
in
fact
a
decision
on
the
merits.
the...
it
has
been
treated
like
that
in
california
since
that
decision
and
perhaps
even
somewhat
before.
the
california
supreme
court
knows
that
when
people
have
a
petition
for
habeas
relief
denied
they
are
going
to
go
to
federal
court.
they
have
been
told...
they
have
been
told
by
the
ninth
circuit
as
to
how
the
ninth
circuit
will
view
their
opinion.
there
is
no
reason
to
go
back
on
that
at
this
point.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
you
must
assume
that
the
judges
know
the
law.
i
would
say
that
the
california
justices
are
very
aware
of
harris
v.
superior
court,
and
if
it
wanted
a
procedural
default
honored
in
the
federal
system
all
it
needed
to
do
was
say
so.
the...
the
state
here
is
asking
in
effect
for
a
reverse
presumption,
as
what
this,
as
declared
in
harris
v.
reed
where
there
is
a
silent
denial.
there's
a
danger
in
that,
because
in
california
if
you
presume
that
a
procedural
default
was
in
fact
applied,
you
might
very
well
be
wrong,
and
then
the
individual
would
be
denied
all
habeas
review.
ms.
juliana
drous
this
is
an
interesting
case.
we
do
have
successive
petitions,
but
all...
and
we
have
two
petitions
in
the
california
supreme
court,
only
because
mr.
nunnemaker,
who
was
in
pro
per
at
the
time,
was
sent
back
to
the
california
supreme
court
by
the
judge
of
the
district
court
saying
i
have
no
idea
what
the
california
supreme
court
meant
in
this
denial.
he
went
back
to
the
california
supreme
court,
and
the
second
time
around
they
cited
no
cases
in
the
denial.
ms.
juliana
drous
that
might
have
had
an
effect.
and
it's
also
possible
that
the
court
decided
to
forgive
the
procedural
default.
that's
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
no
one...
the
only...
the
only
entity
that
knows
in
fact
the
intent
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
the
california
supreme
court.
it
makes
no
sense
whatsoever
to
have
other
people
guessing
at
what
that
intent
was,
either
the
federal
courts
or
the
petitioner.
now,
if
the
burden
is
going
to
be
on
the
petitioner,
i
would
suggest
that
then
that
the
files
of
the
supreme
court,
of
the
california
supreme
court,
would
have
to
be
made
open,
because
there's
no
other
way
to
in
fact
find
out
what
that
intent
was.
the
intent
should
be
stated
by
the
court
who
makes
the
decision,
and
not
others.
ms.
juliana
drous
and
if
that's
the
case,
your
honor,
there
has
been
no
reliance.
the
procedural
default
was
not
in
fact
used,
did
not...
you
cannot
then
say
that
the
procedural
default
barred
review.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
ms.
juliana
drous
excuse
me,
your
honor?
ms.
juliana
drous
i
got
lost
somewhere
along
the
way.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
juliana
drous
if
the...
if
the
federal
courts
decided
that
that
was
the
rule
to
be
imposed
here,
or
if,
if
the
state
court
decided?
ms.
juliana
drous
there
would
be
a
difference.
ms.
juliana
drous
the
hardship
on
my
client
would
be
that
in
fact
perhaps
the
procedural
default
was
excused
and
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
go
into
federal
court
to
litigate
his
federal
constitutional
claim.
he
would
be
denied
his
day
in
court,
in
federal
court
on
the
federal
constitutional
claim.
ms.
juliana
drous
the
problem
is
is
that,
exactly
that,
that
it
might
have
been
and
you
do
not
know
that.
in
fact
in
california--
ms.
juliana
drous
--there's
a--
ms.
juliana
drous
--i
couldn't
state
what
the
mathematical
possibilities
are,
but--
ms.
juliana
drous
--well,
there
is
a
possibility.
ms.
juliana
drous
it's
possible.
it's
possible,
but
the
problem
is--
ms.
juliana
drous
--the
problem
is,
is
that
you
do
not
know.
and
you...
if
you
presume
that
in
fact
that
was
what
was
done,
you
might
be
wrong.
ms.
juliana
drous
i
would...
that
would
sound--
ms.
juliana
drous
--very
few.
but--
ms.
juliana
drous
--probably.
maybe
a...
probably.
but
in
death
penalty
cases
the
rate
is
probably
somewhat
higher
than
in
other
cases.
however,
what
is
ignored
here
that
is...
that
in
40
percent
of
the
cases
in
california
is
documented
by
both
the
state
statistics
and
our
looking
at
the
same
minute
orders,
that
in
fact
california
does
give
reasons
for
denial
in
40
percent
of
the
cases.
which
clearly
indicates
that
california
knows...
the
california
supreme
court
knows
that
federal
review
is
going
to
be
asked
for,
and
that
an
explanation
of
what
their
intent
was
is
needed.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
exactly
my
point,
your
honor.
it's
always
a
good
idea
to
give
reasons.
it
makes
everyone's
job
easier.
it
makes--
ms.
juliana
drous
--in
that
case
i
would
say,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
procedural
default
was
not
relied
upon.
ms.
juliana
drous
yeah,
the...
this
rule
is
not
jurisdictional.
it
does
not...
if
a
procedural
default
is
there,
the
court,
the
federal
court
is
not--
ms.
juliana
drous
--in
that
case,
no,
your
honor.
ms.
juliana
drous
because
the
issue
of
state
procedural
default
is
one
for
the
state
to
decide
and
not
the
federal
court.
whether
a
state--
ms.
juliana
drous
--i
would
end
by
just
asking
this
court
to
not
go
back
on
harris
v.
reed.
it
has
only
been
the
law
a
short
time,
and
in
fact
in
california
the
courts
are
now
giving
more
detailed
explanations
for
denial
of
habeas
review.
and
it's
working
and
it's
going
to
make
everybody's
burden
lighter.
thank
you.
