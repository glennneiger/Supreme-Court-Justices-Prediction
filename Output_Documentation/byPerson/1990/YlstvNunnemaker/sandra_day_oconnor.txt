justice
o'connor
you
take
the
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
probably
relied
on
that
footnote
in
harris--
justice
o'connor
--and
that
footnote,
i
suppose,
in
harris
may
be
dicta,
in
any
event.
justice
o'connor
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
papers
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
to
make...
to
make
that
decision
the
federal
court
has
to
look
to
california
law
to
determine
that
in
california
that's
the
effect
of
the
order,
right?
justice
o'connor
and
that,
of
course,
is
not
what
the
footnote
in
harris
against
reed
suggests.
so
you
would
have
us
back
off
from
that
footnote.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
thompson,
now,
the
order
of
the
california
supreme
court,
the
last
order
denying
the
original
state
habeas,
was
decided...
handed
down
before
our
decision
in
harris
against
reed?
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
and
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
came
down
after
we
had
decided
harris
against
reed?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think,
looking
at
the
record
of
multiple
proceedings
in
this
case,
that
reasonable
people
would
differ
over
the
meaning
of
the
denial
here,
absent
harris
against
reed's
presumption?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
he
could?
