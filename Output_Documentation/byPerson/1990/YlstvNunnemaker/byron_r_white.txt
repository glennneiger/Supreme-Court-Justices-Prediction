justice
white
must
be
what?
justice
white
i
didn't
read
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
way.
i
thought
they
said
that
the
california
supreme
court
on
the
original
habeas
petition
can
and
does
on
occasion
take
a
case
regardless
of
previous
procedural
defaults
and
decide
the
merits,
but
that
most
of
the
time
it
doesn't.
and
that's
why
it
applied
harris
against
reed.
justice
white
misinterpreted
california
law.
justice
white
i
take
it
you
don't...
you
certainly
agree
that
the...
that
the...
on
an
original
habeas
petition
the
california
supreme
court
can
decide
the
merits
if
it
wants
to?
justice
white
but
you
say
if
they,
if
they
just
automatically
just
say
petition
denied--
justice
white
--they
won't...
if
they
decide
the
merits
you
think
there
will
be
an
opinion?
justice
white
your
answer
is
yes
to
the
question?
justice
white
you're
just
saying
that
in
this
case
we
should
just
treat
this
case
as
never
having
been
in
the
california
supreme
court,
as
it
never
really
was.
justice
white
and
that
therefore
the
last
court
to
have
addressed
the
question
is
the
intermediate
appellate
court--
justice
white
--and
it
relies
on
procedural
default.
justice
white
expressly.
justice
white
you're
really
saying
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
supreme
court
was
really...
the
case
was
never
entertained
there.
it
was
just
dismissed.
justice
white
do
you
think
that...
do
you
think
that
we
have
to...
if
we
agree
with
you
we
have
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
misunderstood
california
law?
i
thought
they
just
relied
on
harris
against
reed,
without
any...
without
any...
did
you
argue,
make
this
kind
of
an
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
this
very
argument
that
you're
making,
that
you
should
treat
this
habeas
corpus
petition
when
it's
dismissed
with
just
a
blind
order
as
never
having
really
been
in
the
court...
in
the
supreme
court?
did
you
make
that
argument?
justice
white
all
right.
was
it
briefed?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
it
looks
to
me
like
the
court
of
appeals
just
relied
on
harris
against
reed
without
any
real
close
analysis
of
the
state
law
such
as
you
are
now
presented
to
us.
justice
white
i
would
hesitate
to
say
that
california...
that
the
court
of
appeals
miss...
made
a
mistake
about
state
law--
justice
white
--unless
it's
clear
that
they
did.
justice
white
well
they
didn't
say,
they
didn't
talk
about
state
law
like
you're
talking
about
it.
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
limiting
its
decision
to
original
petitions
for...
for
habeas.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
if
there's...
if
there's
an
original
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
that
court
just
enters
that
blind
order,
dismissed
or
denied...
what
was
it?
dismissed
or
denied?
justice
white
all
right,
denied.
i
would
think
the,
that
the
fellow
who
has
filed
the
original
petition
there
and
loses
on
such
an
order
can
come
right
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari,
and
we
would
not
dismiss
it
on
the
grounds
that
we
didn't
have
any
jurisdiction.
justice
white
and
although
we
usually
say
that
we
don't...
we
only
take
cases
from
a
state
court
that
has
decided
an
issue
that
has
been
presented
to
us.
justice
white
so
we
could,
we
could
theoretically
and
actually
we
could
reverse--
justice
white
--the
california
supreme
court.
justice
white
when
they
have
just
denied
review?
justice
white
i
thought
you
agreed
that
harris...
that
there
just
ought
to
be
the
simple
rule,
either
the
last
court
that
deals
with
the
case
says
procedural
default
or
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
white
and
you
don't...
and
you
say...
so
that
saves
you
from
examining
all
sorts
of--
