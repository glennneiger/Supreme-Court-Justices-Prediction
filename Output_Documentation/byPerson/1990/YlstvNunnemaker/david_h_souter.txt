where
do
we
look
first
for
a
concise
statement
of
california
law
on
this?
it's
true
there
are
some
cases
in
which
they
do
exactly
what
you
have
described,
and
then
there's
a
whole
string
of
cases
in
which
they
simply
give
a
one-sentence
order.
has
the
supreme
court
of
california
ever
come
down
with
a
definitive
statement
itself
about
the
significance
of
the
one-sentence
orders,
or
do
we
have
to
just
infer
it
from
practice?
justice
souter
as
i
understand
it,
the
jurisdiction
is
not
discretionary
in
the
sense
that
they
must
in
effect
entertain
the
case
at
length
and
come
down
with
a
discursive
opinion.
but
it
seems
to
be
an
open
question
so
far
as
what
we
have
had
presented
to
us
as
to
whether
it
is
discretionary
in
the
sense
that
a
denial
does
not
imply
a
view
of
the
merits.
you...
the
parties
here
disagree,
and
i
want
to
know
where
we
can
look
for
a
definitive
statement
of
california
law
on
that.
justice
souter
does
griggs...
does
griggs
hold
that
a
decision
following
that
review
is
necessarily
a
decision
on
the
merits?
justice
souter
it
sounds
then
as
though
this
pamphlet,
whatever
its
status
may
be,
probably
is
the
closest
thing
we're
going
to
get
to
a
definitive
statement
of
california
law.
justice
souter
and
your
authority
for
saying
that
are
the
cases,
as
i
understand
it,
from
which
you
were
quoting
the
verbs
a
few
moments
ago?
