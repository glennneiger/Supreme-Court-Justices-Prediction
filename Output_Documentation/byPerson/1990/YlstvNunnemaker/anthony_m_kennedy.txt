justice
kennedy
i
suppose
this
would
differ
from
state
to
state?
justice
kennedy
so
harris
v.
reed
requires
us
to
look
in
a
very
searching
way
at
the
procedural
law
of
all
of
these
different
states
in
order
to
understand
the
consequences
of
these
orders?
justice
kennedy
you
don't
think
we've
given
a
searching
examination
into
california
law
here
this
morning?
justice
kennedy
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
harris
v.
reed
was
to
avoid
having
to
do
that.
justice
kennedy
after
we
do
50
states?
justice
kennedy
do
you
think
this
is
easier
than
our
having
to
just
look
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
a
procedural
default
on
the
merits,
something
we're
familiar
with?
justice
kennedy
do
you
say
that
there's
a
probability
that
that
would
have
been
the
case?
justice
kennedy
do
you
base
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
on
the
mathematical
possibilities
of
this
happening?
justice
kennedy
not
even
a
mathematical
possibility?
justice
kennedy
how
about
a
probability?
justice
kennedy
it's
possible,
but
not
probable,
is
it?
