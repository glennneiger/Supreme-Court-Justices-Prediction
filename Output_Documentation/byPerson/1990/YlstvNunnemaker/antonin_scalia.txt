justice
scalia
certainly
you
acknowledge,
don't
you,
a
matter
of
california
law?
justice
scalia
and
so
what
we
have
to
do
is
take
our
best
shot
at
figuring
out
whether
california,
the
california
supreme
court
itself
regards
its
habeas
petitions
as
mandatory
or
discretionary.
is
that
right?
is
that
a
fair
refrain
of
the
question?
justice
scalia
no,
the
discretion
we're
talking
about
here,
to
make
it
clearer,
is
discretion
not
to
consider
the
case.
justice
scalia
to
look
at
the
case
and
say
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
important
enough,
or
the
probability
of
error
below
does
not
seem
to
us
enough,
without
really
looking
into
it.
it
just,
you
know,
it's
not
a
useful
expenditure
of
our
time.
that's
the
kind
of
discretion
we're
talking
about.
justice
scalia
um-hum.
justice
scalia
and
it
doesn't
have
two
different
formulations,
denied
or
declined?
whether
it's
on
the
merits
or
not,
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
always
the
same?
it's
denied.
justice
scalia
50
times
isn't
so
many,
i
suppose,
compared
to
the
alternative.
justice
scalia
--i
suppose
there
would
be
no
problem
if
the
california
constitution
were
amended
not
to
eliminate
the
original
habeas
jurisdiction
of
the
california
supreme
court,
but
simply
to
make
it
clear
that
that
jurisdiction
is
discretionary.
i
suppose
it
could
be
amended
that
way.
justice
scalia
and
then
we'd
have
no
problem
here.
we'd
simply
look
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
can
other
people
rely
on
it
for
determining
what
the
basis
of
the
decision
was?
i
mean,
if
it's
depublished
and
it
states
a
procedural
default
basis,
does
the
depublishing
eliminate
that
as
the
basis
or
not?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
of
course
there
may
not
be
any
single
intent.
i
mean,
you
may
have
had
four
justices
vote
for...
against...
against
your
client
each
for
a
quite
different
reason.
that
is
quite
possible,
too,
so
that
the
court
couldn't
even
give
a
reason.
if
you
asked
the
court
to
give
a
reason,
it
couldn't
give
any.
justice
scalia
i
guess
that's
an
interesting
question.
what
if,
i
mean,
you
needed
four
votes.
what
if
only
one
of
them
relied
on
the
procedural...
it's
a
least
a
but
for
cause,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
oh,
i
don't
know.
we
give
reasons.
we
don't
expect
anybody
to
be
reviewing
us.
you
give
reasons.
it's
always
a
good
idea
to
give
reasons
where
you
can,
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
but
sometimes
you
can't.
sometimes
you
can't,
where
you
have
four
justices
voting
not
to
take
a
case
for
a
different
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
of
these
cases
is
ylst
versus
nunnemaker.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
respondent
was
convicted
of
murder
in
state
court.
on
appeal,
he
argued
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
denied
his
miranda
rights.
the
california
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
claim
relying
upon
a
state
procedural
rule
that
miranda
claims
cannot
be
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
the
respondent
next
filed
successive
petitions
for
state
collateral
relief
in
the
state
trial
court,
the
state
court
of
appeals,
and
twice
in
the
california
supreme
court.
each
of
these
petitions
was
denied
without
opinion
in
an
unexplained
order.
the
respondent
then
filed
for
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court.
the
district
court
dismissed
sighting
the
procedural
bar
that
had
been
imposed
by
the
state
courts.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
relying
upon
our
holding
in
harris
versus
reed
that
a
state
court
must
clearly
and
expressly
state
its
reliance
upon
a
procedural
default
in
order
to
bar
federal
habeas
review.
the
court
thought
that
the
california
supreme
court's
silent
denial
of
respondent's
state
habeas
petition
lifted
the
procedural
bar
imposed
on
direct
review.
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
in
coleman
versus
thompson,
which
is
also
announced
today,
we
hold
that
the
rule
of
harris
applies
only
where
it
has
been
determined
that
the
relevant
state
court
decision
fairly
appears
to
rest
upon
federal
law.
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
presuming
that
the
silent
order
of
the
california
supreme
court
rested
upon
federal
law
without
asking
whether
there
was
any
reason
to
think
that
it
did.
they
remains
a
difficult
question
of
how
a
court
is
to
determine
whether
a
decision
fairly
appears
to
rest
upon
federal
law.
we
think
that
inquiry
can
be
facilitated
in
the
present
case
by
applying
the
following
presumption
where
there
has
been
one
reasoned
state
court
judgment
rejecting
a
federal
claim,
subsequent
silent
or
unexplained
orders
upholding
that
judgment
or
rejecting
the
same
claim
rest
upon
the
same
ground.
the
essence
of
unexplained
orders
is
that
they
say
nothing.
we
think
that
a
presumption
which
gives
them
no
effect
would
simply
look
through
them
to
the
last
recent
decision
most
nearly
reflects
the
role
they
are
intended
to
play.
that
presumption
should
be
rebuttal
by
strong
evidence
that
the
federal
claim
was
rejected
upon
a
different
ground.
in
the
present
case,
the
last
recent
decision
upon
the
merits
of
respondent's
miranda
claim
was
that
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
on
direct
review
which
unequivocally
rested
on
a
state
procedural
default.
we
will
look
through
the
subsequent
unexplained
denials
of
collateral
review
to
that
opinion
unless
respondent
produces
strong
evidence
that
one
of
the
subsequent
courts
reach
the
merit
of
its
federal
claim.
he
has
not
done
so.
the
most
he
can
show
is
that
those
courts
could
have
reached
the
merits
if
they
wanted
to,
but
to
show
that
they
could
is
not
to
suggest
that
they
did.
federal
court
review
of
the
reminder
claim
is
therefore
bared
unless
respondent
can
establish
cause
and
prejudice
under
murray
versus
carrier.
the
district
court
found
no
cause
and
prejudice
but
since
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
occasion
to
review
that
holding,
we
remand
for
that
purpose.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissent
in
which
justices
marshall
and
stevens
join.
