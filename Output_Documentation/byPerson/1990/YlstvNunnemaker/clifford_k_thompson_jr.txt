mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
footnote
dictum--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
that
footnote
dictum
in
harris
against
reed
compels
a
federal
court
to
presume
that
by
summarily
denying
a
successive
state
habeas
corpus
petition
the
california
supreme
court
intentionally
waived
a
procedural
default
that
the
state
court
of
appeal
had
expressly
claimed
10
years
earlier.
in
1976
respondent
nunnemaker
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
on
appeal
he
challenged
prosecution
evidence
on
miranda
grounds.
the
california
court
of
appeal
refused
to
consider
that
claim
on
its
merits
because,
contrary
to
the
state's
statutory
contemporaneous
objection
rule,
no
objection
was
made
to
that
evidence
at
trial
on
any
constitutional
ground.
seven
years
later
the
respondent
began
collaterally
attacking
his
conviction.
the
state
trial
court,
the
state
court
of
appeals,
and
the
california
supreme
court
successively
denied
his
petitions,
all
without
discussing
the
merits
of
his
federal
claim.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
at
that
point,
mr.
nunnemaker
then
turned
to
the
federal
district
court,
which
ultimately
denied
his
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
in
fact
waived...
procedurally
defaulted
his
miranda
claim.
he
then
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
while
that
appeal
was
pending
this
court
announced
its
decision
in
harris
v.
reed,
which
became
the
basis
for
the
decision
below,
reached
without
the
benefit
of
argument
or...
either
briefing
or
oral
argument
on
this
court's
intervening
decision.
it
was
in
the
context
of
divining
the
unspoken
intent
underlying
a
7-page
state
court
opinion
that
in
harris
against
reed
the
court
held
that
a
procedural
default
would
not
bar
consideration
of
a
federal
claim
either
on
direct
or
federal
habeas
review
unless
the
last
state
court
rendering
judgment
clearly
and
expressly
stated
that
its
decision
rested
on
a
state
procedural
bar.
so
the
holding
of
harris
appeared
to
apply
only
when
it
was
unclear
whether
in
fact
the
last
state
court
to
write
an
opinion
had
invoked
a
state
procedural
rule.
and
in
harris
the
last
state
court
wrote
an
opinion,
an
opinion
expressly
deciding
the
federal
question,
but
no
state
court
in
harris
clearly
claimed
a
procedural
default.
by
contrast,
in
nunnemaker
a
state
court
did
claim
clearly,
in
fact
exclusively
as
a
basis
for
its
decision,
a
state
procedural
bar.
no
state
court
addressed
the
federal
question,
and
the
last
state
court
did
not
write
an
opinion.
nevertheless--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
quotes
your
opinion
and
says
that
the
supreme
court
in
harris
discussed
the
issue
now
before
us.
and
it
then
holds
that
the
judgment,
that
the
california
supreme
court
summary
denial
is
a
judgment
under
harris,
without
reference
to
state
law.
it
declined
to
look
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
california
supreme
court's
order
denying
the
petition.
and
it,
like
harris,
did
not
distinguish
between
the
exercise
of
a
state's
court's
mandatory
and
discretionary
jurisdiction.
now,
on
its
face
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
say
that
harris
disposes
of
this
case.
and
i
think
that
that
view
is
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
the
ninth
circuit
unnecessarily
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
petition
for
review,
not...
that
is
addressed
to
the
state
supreme
court's
discretionary
appellate
jurisdiction
in
a
habeas
corpus
case,
if
it
were
summarily
denied
might
not
be
a
judgment
within
the
harris
rule
also.
so
it
would
seem
the
ninth
circuit
takes
a
fairly
literal
reading
of
harris.
i
may
be,
however--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--i
do,
your
honor.
i
recognize--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--oh,
it's
unquestionably
dicta,
your
honor.
i
mean,
those
were
not
the
facts
as
described,
i
think,
in
footnote
1
of
the
dissent
and
in
the
text
of
the
opinion.
the
facts
before
harris
were
that
it
involved
an
opinion.
what
harris
involved,
the
application
of
the
plain
statement
in...
rule
in
harris
was
really
an
application
of
the
plain
english
rule.
the
state
interest
at
stake
was
in
writing
ambiguous
opinions.
here
california
is
asking
that
its
state
supreme
court
have
the
right
to
decide
when
to
write
its
opinions,
not
how
to
write
them.
and
the
complementary
federal
interest
in
harris
was
in
relieving
federal
courts
of
the
somewhat
impossible
task
of
deciphering
all
those
ambiguous
opinions.
in
this
case,
however,
california
simply
asked
that
the
federal
court
correctly
interpret
california
law,
and
that
once
that
is
done
that
that
interpretation
will
inform
all
federal
subsequent
litigation.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
ninth
circuit's
reading
of
harris
was
reinforced
by
its
longstanding
misapprehension
of
california
law,
namely
that
the
california
supreme
court's
habeas
jurisdiction,
because
it
is
original,
must
be
mandatory.
well,
that
is
not
true.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
mandatory,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
opinion
that
way,
your
honor.
i
believe
it's
an
extension
of
what
we
in
california
call
the
ninth
circuit's
postcard
rule.
back
in
1974
they
were
faced
with
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
summary
denials
from
the
california
supreme
court
when
the
issue
was
exhaustion.
and
this
is
3
years
before
wainwright
was
even
decided.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
summary
denial.
by
that,
your
honor,
i
mean
a
denial
that
says
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
denied.
there
is
no
explanation
and
no
citation
of
authority.
in
order
to
prevent
a
situation
in
which
the
prisoner
became
a
ping
pong
ball
going
back
and
forth
between
federal
and
state
courts,
the
ninth
circuit
created
a
presumption,
and
that
was
that
a
summary
denial
exhausted
state
remedies.
we
don't
object
to
that
presumption.
we
don't
think
that
the
state
has
any
legitimate
interest
in
exhausting
the
petitioner
as
opposed
to
his
remedies.
what
happened
was
subsequently,
in
1989
in
lewis
against
borg,
the
ninth
circuit
extended
that
rule
in
the
context
of
procedural
default.
we
don't
accept
that
rule.
i
mean,
the
state
interests
are
altogether
different
in
the
two
situations.
the
ninth
circuit's
reference
in
nunnemaker
to
the
california
supreme
court's
original
jurisdiction
refers
to
its
holding
in
harris
against
superior
court.
they
do
not
cite
that,
but
they
do
cite
mcquown
v.
mccartney
distinguishing
harris.
i
think
that
that's
fairly
clear.
the
problem
lies
in
the
ninth
circuit's
insistence
that
the
california
supreme
court's
habeas
jurisdiction
is
mandatory.
i
mean,
if
it
were
discretionary--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--what
i
mean,
your
honor,
is
that
the
california
supreme
court's
denial
represents
its
view
of
the
merits
of
a
habeas
petition.
and
it
is
our
position
that
they
do
not
treat
in
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
invoking
their
original
jurisdiction
any
differently
from
a
petition
for
a
review
either
from
direct
appeal
or
from
a
court
of
appeals
decision
in
a
habeas
case.
the
ninth
circuit
disputes
that.
however,
and
i
understand
that
it's
awkward
for
the
state
to
come
here
and
say
that
the
local
federal
court
has
misinterpreted
ninth
circuit
law
or
is
in
exception
to
that.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
yes.
california
law.
there
is
an
exception
to
that
rule,
however,
and
that's
sort
of
a
plain
error
doctrine.
when
it's
clear
that
there
has
been
an
error,
this
court
will
correct
it.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
if
it
wants
to,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--that's
a
decision
not
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
under
california
procedure
if
they
are
going
to
decide
the
merits
they
will
first
issue
an
order
to
show
cause.
under
our
law
the
case
doesn't
become
a
cause
for
decision
without
an
order
to
show
cause,
and
they
will
issue
one
and
hear
argument
and
decide
the
case.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
no
more,
your
honor,
than
an
order
from
this
court
saying
that
certiorari
is
denied.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yeah,
i
mean,
they
look
at
everything,
but
the
criteria
go
far
beyond
the
merits.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i
think
that
the
answer
is,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
decision
on
the
merits.
it
is
a
decision
that
for
whatever
reason
they
do
not
wish
to
entertain
the
case.
for
example--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--i
think,
your
honor,
no,
because
in
that
case
they
would,
what
they
would
say
is
they
would
deny
the
writ
and
then
cite
to
in
re
swain
saying...
which
is
a
state
case,
saying
that
you
don't
state
a
prima
facie
case.
but--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
recognized,
it
turns
on
the
nature
of
the
state
jurisdiction.
if
it's
discretionary,
if
a
petition
invokes
discretionary
jurisdiction,
then
the
ninth
circuit
would
not
look
behind
it.
they
have
done
that
in
idaho.
just--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
where
i
find
it
is
in
the
california
supreme
court's
manual
of
practices
and
procedures,
where
at
page
13
the
court
describes
its
own--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--your
honor,
it's
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
copies
have
been
provided
to
the
clerk
of
the
court.
it's
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
respondent's
brief
and
in
one
amicus
brief,
and
is
the...
according
to
the
chief
justice
of
california,
some
10,000
copies
have
been
printed
and
distributed.
what
the
california
court
said
there
is
that,
as
follows.
appeals
in
all
death
penalty
cases
are
automatically
taken
to
the
california
supreme
court.
other
cases
normally
come
before
the
court
either
in
the
form
of
petitions
for
review
of
decisions
by
the
court
of
appeal
or
as
petitions
for
extraordinary
writs
of
mandate,
prohibition,
certiorari,
or
habeas
corpus.
in
these
cases
the
court
must
decide
whether
to
accept
the
matter
for
decision.
like
the
united
states
supreme
court,
the
california
supreme
court
has
discretionary
jurisdiction
over
many
of
the
matters
presented
to
it.
thus,
with
the
exception
of
a
relatively
small
number
of
appeals
that
come
to
the
court
directly,
it
has
discretion
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
will
accept
any
particular
case
for
review
and
decision
on
the
merits.
in
other
words,
that
the
order
saying
that
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
denied
means
we
do
not
entertain
the
petition,
we
will
not
hear
the
case.
it
is
not
a
decision
on
the
merits.
it
is
not
intended
to
be
a
waiver
of
any
procedural
default.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
it
is
exactly--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--like
that
in
our
view,
your
honor,
yes.
and
in
fact--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
you
would
have
jurisdiction
to
take
it,
but
under--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--yes.
but
under
the
practice
of
looking
through
a
discretionary
denial
order,
and
that
would
be
one.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
in
which
case
the
state
court
would,
having
reached
the
first--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--could
not
claim
a
procedural
default.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
you
would
re...
you
would
have
jurisdiction
to
review
their
order,
but
the
only
decision
they
would
make
is
the
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i
understand.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
no,
i
think
what
you
would
have
jurisdiction
to
review
is
their
exercise
of
discretion,
which
could
be
challenged--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--well,
i
think
what
would
happen
is
you
would
have
to
conclude
that
you
should
deny
cert.
because
there
was
no
judgment
on
the
merits.
now,
the
court
could
choose,
i
suppose,
by
analogy
to
its
practice
on
direct
review,
to
look
through
the
state
supreme
court's
habeas
denial
until
you
got
a
decision.
now
you
should
get
one
even
on
habeas,
because
the
rule
260(e)
of
the
california
rules
of
court
requires
a
trial
court
when
it
denies
a
habeas
petition
to
state
brief
reasons
for
its
denial.
in
this
case
you
could
look
through
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
reach
the
merits.
i
am
not
sure
that
the
court
would
wish
to
do
that,
because
what
it
would
do
in
practice
is
to
result
in
allowing
the
petitioner
to
renew
his
petition
for
cert.
annually
or
even
more
frequently
because
he
could
always
file
a
petition
for
habeas
in
california
criticizing
or
challenging
on
federal
grounds
a
decision
rendered
by
a
court
of
appeal
or
even
the
supreme
court
years
earlier,
and
then
if
the
subsequent
habeas
were
reviewable
then
you
would
get
to
review
that
cert.
petition
at
least
once
or
twice
a
year.
now
you
might
wish
not
to
do
that
and
say
instead
to
the
petitioner,
you
have
quite
an
adequate
remedy
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
that
decision,
however,
would
be
the
court's
and
is
not
determined
by
the
outcome
in
this
case.
all
we're
asking
is
that
harris
v.
reed
plain
statement
rule
be
applied
only
to
judgments,
that
judgment
be
defined
by
state
law
consistent
with
sykes'
goal
of--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--i
am
saying,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--the
last
state
court.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yes.
exclusively,
in
fact.
did
not
discuss
the
federal
claim.
yes,
we're
saying--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
therefore
a
summary
denial
of
a
habeas
petition
by
the
california
supreme
court,
whether
it
invokes
their
original
or
appellate
jurisdiction,
is,
for
procedural
default
purposes,
a
neutral
procedural
event.
it
means
nothing.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
have
the
court
honor
the
principle
that
the
state
court
is
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
its
own
law.
and
i
believe
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
spoken
very
clearly
in
the
passage
i
read,
a
passage
which
certainly
would
satisfy
any
plain
statement
rule,
even
if
only
because
it
is
written
for
lay
people,
as
the
respondent
will
say.
but
there's
more.
there
are
examples,
and
we
furnish
them.
in
in
re
joiner,
in
re
jackson,
those
are
two
california
habeas
cases
in
which
the
state
court
quite
clearly
said
that
our
criteria
for
accepting
an
original
habeas
petition
include
the
public
importance
of
the
question
presented
and
the
possibility
of
conflict
below.
those
are
precisely
the
criteria
that
the
california
supreme
court
uses
under
rule
29
in
exercising
its
discretionary
appellate
jurisdiction.
in
addition--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--we
didn't...
your
honor--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
oral
argument
in
this
case.
it
was...
the
ninth
circuit
submitted
it
without
oral
argument.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
briefing
was
completed
in
this
case,
your
honor,
before
you
decided
harris
v.
reed.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
we
were
at
a
bit
of
a
disadvantage.
we
think--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--that's
unclear,
your
honor.
i
think...
what
is
clear
to
me
is
what,
if
we
go
back,
what
will
happen--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--well,
they
have.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is
clear,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
well,
that
depends
on
the
meaning
one
attributes
to
their
reference
in
the
opinion
below
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
petition
invoking
the
california
supreme
court's
original
jurisdiction.
because
that's
the
phrase
that
they
seized
upon
in
harris
against
superior
court
in
1974,
i
believe,
in
characterizing,
or
mischaracterizing
our
state
supreme
court's
habeas
practice.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
in
all
candor,
however,
i
find
it
difficult
to
assign
a
great
deal
of
importance
to
that.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
not
perceptibly
altered
its
practice
since
harris
against
reed.
in
noncapital
cases...
capital
cases
are
different
because
the
state
supreme
court
has
mandatory
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
under
its
rules
consolidates
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
and
so
in
those
cases
they
will
claim
procedural
default.
they
will
use
the
words
"procedural
default".
they
have
not
done
so
in
any
noncapital
case,
and
in
1989
denied
550...
gave
550
summary
denials
and
about
648
in
1990.
they
are
not
going
to
change
their
practice.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
it
is
that
it
would
put
an
enormous
burden
on
them.
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
to
cite
state
cases,
as
they
do...
swain,
linley,
dexter...
because
those
cases
show
defects
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
petition.
defects
not
in
the
procedure
below
but
in
the
petition
itself,
such
as
not
stating
a
prima
facie
case
or
raising
a
question
of
fourth
amendment
law,
for
example.
our
state
courts
anticipated
stone
v.
powell
in
that
regard.
those
are
principles
that
are
fairly
non-controversial.
they
don't
require
a
lot
of
time
to
apply,
not
much
judge
time
involved.
those
orders
do
not
even
relate
to
individual
claims,
and
many
of
the
petitions
present
up
to
16
or
more
claims.
so
there
is
not
much
time
involved...
de
minimus
drafting
time.
those
are
easy
orders
to
write.
on
the
other
hand,
for
the
state
supreme
court
to
claim
a
procedural
default
is
pretty
onerous.
the
ninth
circuit
itself
in
bachelor
against
cup
pointed
out
that
most
times
it's
more
difficult
to
decide
the
procedural
default
question
than
the
underlying
merits.
now,
what
the
ninth
circuit
is
asking
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
look
at
this
petition
and
then
determine
whether
there
has
been
exhaustion,
whether
there
has
been
a
claim
of
a
procedural
default,
whether
the
state
rules
vindicates
legitimate
interest,
whether
it
has
been
even-handedly
applied,
whether
it
is
truly
independent
of
federal
law,
and
whether
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
that
default,
or
whether
it
is
cause
and
prejudice.
i
mean,
this
is
an
enormous
burden
on
a
court
whose
docket
approaches
this
court's.
they
simply
can't
do
it,
which
is
why
they
haven't
done
what
the
ninth
circuit
wants.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
has
given
the
supreme
court
of
california
an
ultimatum.
it
says
you
have
three
choices.
either
continue
your
summary
denial
process
and
we'll
view
it
as
a
ruling
on
the
merits,
and
then
you
will
undermine
the
integrity
of
your
state
procedural
rules
and
the
finality
of
your
judgments,
or
do
all
this
work
that
i
have
just
been
describing,
adding
at
least
650
cases
a
year
to
your
caseload.
and
that
doesn't
include
the
never-ending
stream
of
petitions
as
predicted
by
the
harris
dissent
that
will
result
by
guys
who
will...
prisoners
who
will
keep
petitioning
until
they
get
a
suitably
ambiguous--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--because,
your
honor,
when
the
federal
district
court
looks
through
these
summary
denials
and
hits
that
state
court
opinion,
it'll
apply
the
harris
v.
reed
plain
statement
rule.
and
if
the
state
court
of
appeal,
for
example,
in
this
case--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--well,
the
question
then
is
that
they're
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
there
was
cause
or
prejudice.
because
if
there...
if
there
was,
then
the
procedural
default
is
forgiven.
or
they
could
decide
on
a
given
case,
gee,
maybe
we
should
forgive
it.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
it's
enormous.
and
they
have
to
do
this
not
just
once,
but
as
to
each
separate
federal
claim
that's
presented.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
because
then,
your
honor,
to
do
that
they
would
have
to
review
both
the
record
to
determine
whether
in
fact
it
was,
the
trial
record,
and
they
don't
do
that
in
a
habeas
case.
they
look
at
the
habeas
petition
and
they
look
at
the
opinion.
that's
the...
those
are
the
documents
on
which
these
are
generally
disposed
of.
i
mean,
after
all,
we
had,
in
1989,
898
denials.
there
were
only
20
cases
that
weren't
denied.
now
it
cannot
be--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--well,
i
guess
they
have
them
available,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they...
that
they...
they
obviously
are
not
making
the
same
inquiry.
i
mean,
after
all,
there's
another
factor
here,
too,
and
that
is
that
normally--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
--i
believe
that
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
but
it's
not
easy
to
tell
everything
that
they
do,
because
these
are
basically
ex
parte
proceedings.
outside
of
a
capital
case,
we
are
rarely
asked
to
respond
to
a
habeas
corpus
petition.
and
so
there
is
nobody
there
on
behalf
of
the
state
to
urge
procedural
default.
they
may
have
to
find
it
on
their
own.
not
only
that,
but
the
prototypical
cause
for
excusing
default
is
competency
of
counsel.
so
now
they're
going
to
have
to
decide...
the
state
court
will
have
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
competency
claim
in
order
to
decide
whether
to
waive
the
procedural
default.
and
there's
an
enormous
burden
being
asked
here.
now,
they
have
to...
they
either
have
to
do
that,
accept
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
or
renounce
their
original
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
if
they
do
that,
they
can
escape
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
because
essentially
that's
what
happened
in
idaho.
and
we
don't
think
that
comity
should
force
the
court
to
amend...
the
state
to
amend
its
own
constitution.
however,
the
court
may
get
a
little
assistance
from
the
electorate
in
that
respect
because
on
the
28th
of
january
of
this
year
assembly
constitutional
amendment
10
was
introduced
in
the
state
assembly.
it
proposes
to
curtail
the
california
supreme
court's
habeas...
original
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
and
we
hope
that
that
doesn't...
that
doesn't
happen.
i
don't
think
that
would,
that
would
serve
anyone's
interest.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
district
court
did
not
send
mr.
nunnemaker
back
to
the
state
courts
because
it
could
not
figure
out
what
they
were
up
to.
it
couldn't
understand
what
mr.
nunnemaker
was
up
to,
because,
as
indicated
at
page
83
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
came
to
the
district
court
and
said
i
have
raised
none
of
my
claims
on
direct
appeal
in
the
state
courts.
that's
why
it
was
sent
back
for
exhaustion.
the
respondent
says
what
burden
does
footnote
12
impose
on
the
state
courts.
i'd
like
to
give
an
example.
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
doesn't
simply
require
an
unequivocal
claim
of
default
by
the
last
state
court
rendering
judgment.
it
has
to
do
it
in
the
last
order
it
enters.
so
the
california
supreme
court
granted
a
hearing,
claimed
a
default,
and
then
came
upon
the
case
again
on
collateral
attack,
on
habeas
review,
and
issued
a
summary
denial.
the
ninth
circuit
would
hold,
under
its
interpretation
of
footnote
12,
that
they
had
waived
the
default
they
claimed
in
the
first
place.
why
any
court
would
do
that
is
inexplicable
to
me,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it...
that
that's
quite
contrary
to
the
assurance
given
in
harris
that
a
state
court
need
do
no
more
to
preclude
federal
review
on
habeas
than
it
need
do
on
direct
review.
