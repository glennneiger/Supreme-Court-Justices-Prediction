justice
stevens
now,
mr.
dawson,
you're
not
arguing
it
was
reviewable
at
the
time
of
the
oral...
every
case
covered
by
this
rule
is
not
reviewable
at
the
time
of
the
oral
announcement,
because
that
clearly
speaks
to
orders
that
are
not
yet
final.
justice
stevens
they're
all
prejudgment
and
oral
announcements.
justice
stevens
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
rule.
justice
stevens
but
the
rules
doesn't
say
anything
about
journal
entries.
it
talks
about
oral
announcements.
justice
stevens
and
the
question
is
whether
this
was
an
announcement
within
the
meaning
of
that
rule.
that's
the
whole
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
no,
but
the
rule
doesn't
purport
to
do
that.
it
speaks
to
the
date
at
which
the
thing
becomes
appealable,
which
is
after
it
becomes
final
and
that's
when
the
oral...
that's
when
the
notice
of
appeal
becomes
effective
under
the
rules.
justice
stevens
so,
it's
perfectly
clear
there's
no
finality
before
the
judgment
was
entered,
no
appealability.
it
couldn't
have
been.
you
couldn't
change
the
act
of
congress.
but
if
your
notice
of
appeal
was
followed
the
day
after
it
became
a
final,
if
the
rule
provided
that's
when
it
becomes
effective,
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
if
your
notice
of
appeal
becomes
effective
as
soon
as
the
judgment
becomes
final,
which
is
what
the
rule
says--
justice
stevens
--then,
of
course,
you
have
a...
then
a
final
judgment
to
appeal.
justice
stevens
just
what
the
rule
says.
that's
all.
justice
stevens
i
just
don't
understand
that
argument,
because
appealability
and
finality
are
the
same
thing.
appealability
is
after
the
judgment
becomes
final.
all
you
do
is
postpone
the
effective
date
of
the
notice.
it
doesn't
change
the
date
of
appealability
or
the
date
of
finality.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
if
it's
a
collateral
order
doctrine,
then
it's
final
when
it's
entered.
but
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
that.
justice
stevens
as
i
understand
your
position
it's
just
it...
it
doesn't
become
final
until
the
judgment's
entered.
but...
notice
of
appeal
is
treated
as
if
it
were
filed
the
day...
the
next
day.
justice
stevens
and
that's
what
the
rule
says.
justice
stevens
mr.
roberts,
that's
not
involved
by
your
opponent's
theory
here.
there's
no
jurisdiction
in
the
appellate
court
until
the
notice
of
appeal
becomes
effective.
justice
stevens
and
it
doesn't
become
effective
'til
the
judgment
becomes
final.
justice
stevens
and
also
the
notice
of
appeal
became
effective
on
that
same
date
under
the
rule.
