chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
no.
89-1063,
firstier
mortgage
company
v.
investors
mortgage
insurance
company.
mr.
dawson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
was
more
in
that
colloquy,
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
than
what
you've
just--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--okay.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
was
on
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
the
district
court
ordinarily
make
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'd
always
thought
of
findings
of
fact
as
being
something
you
have
at
the
end
of
a
bench
trial
where
there
are
contested
facts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
1291
certainly
speaks
in
terms
of
a
final
decision,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
mr.
dawson,
do
you
think
that
a
rule
of
appellate
procedure
can
make
appealable
something
which
1291
does
not
make
appealable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
it
would
have
to
be
a
final
decision
before
it
could
be
appealed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes,
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
1291,
1292.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
know,
the
rule
itself
could
not
enlarge
what's
appealable.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dawson.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
this
had
been
a
bench
trial,
mr.
dawson,
not
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
at
the
close
of
the
bench
trial,
the
judge
says...
he
looks
at
his
notes
and
he
says,
i'm
going
to
find
for
the
plaintiff
and
against
the
defendant,
and
outlines
very
generally
what
he
thinks
the
facts
are.
and
then
he
turns
to
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
and
says,
now,
plaintiffs
submit
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
the
defendants
have
a
certain
time
to
object
to
them,
et
cetera.
is...
is
that
final
under
the
rule
within
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dawson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1063
firstier
mortgage
company
against
investors
mortgage
insurance
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
