mr.
jack
s.
dawson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client
sued
the
insurance
company
over
eight
policies
of
private
mortgage
insurance.
they
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
set
for
oral
argument
after
a
lot
of
briefing.
if
you
had
been
in
the
courtroom
on
january
the
26th,
1989,
you
would
have
heard
judge
bohanon
say,
these
policies
should
be
and
are
cancelled.
he
said
these
policies
are
void,
and
then
he
turned
to
me
and
ms.
dansby
and
said,
the
losing
party
has
a
right
to
appeal.
i
don't
think
you'll
get
anywhere,
but
you
may
appeal
my
decision.
and
so
ms.
dansby
and
i
went
back
to
the
office
and
looked
at
rule
4(a)(2).
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
and
i'll...
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
just
a
minute.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
well,
i'll
get
to
it
right
now.
he
said
then...
back
to
mr.
gray,
who
represented
the
defendant...
i
would
like
for
you
to
prepare
suggested
findings
of
fact
and
conclusion
of
law
and
i
want
you
to
point
out
for
me
the
evidence
that
you
rely
on
and
where
i
can
find
it
in
the
record.
and
he
gave
him
10
days
to
do
that
and
then
said,
and
give
your
opposing
counsel
a
copy
of
that
and
then,
mr.
dawson,
if
you
find
any
of
those
are
in
error,
you
may
point
that
out
to
me,
also.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
they
don't
have
to,
of
course,
under
rule
56.
they
don't
have
to
at
all.
and
i--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--yes,
sir,
and
then
i
think
the
court
it
required
to
under
the
rule.
but
i
think
under
a
motion
for
summary
judgement
because
we,
the
lawyers,
are
supposed
to
set
out
in
our
briefs
what
the
facts
are,
that
it's...
i
can't
tell
you
what's
ordinarily
done.
i'd
say
50-50,
something
like
that.
but
anyway,
it's
not
a
requirement.
we
went
in...
went
back,
we
filed
our
notice
of
appeal
and
we
said
very
specifically,
we're
appealing
from
the
announcement
of
a
decision.
we
said
the
judgment
has
not
been
entered
and
we
said
we're
relying
on
4(a)(2)
and
so
we
thought
we
knew
what
we
were
doing.
we
studied
this
and
did
this
on
purpose.
then
we
get
the
letter
from
the
circuit
court
that
said,
please
brief
the
issue
of
whether
we
had
jurisdiction
because...
excuse
me...
judge
bohanon
was
considering
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
we--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--the
only
risk
that
i
see
as
a
trial
lawyer
is
the
risk
of
misdocketing,
the
risk
of
mailing
it
late,
the
risk
of
running
up
a
deadline.
you...
when
you're
trying
these
lawsuits,
and
you'll
occasionally
lose
some
of
them,
you
need
to
appeal,
you
wake
up
at
night
and
you
think,
oh,
have
i
filed
a
motion.
you
never
wake
up
at
night
thinking
i
filed
it
too
early.
you're...
you
know,
you're
always
worried
about
getting
it
on
file
or
is
it
docketed
right
or
is
the
mail
going
to
run.
so,
that's
the
decision.
there's
also
another
reason
for
getting
these
in
early
if...
it's
like
playing
football.
once
you
lose
one
game
or
win
one
game,
you
want
to
focus
on
the
next
game
as
soon
as
possible.
and
that's
the
way
ms.
dansby
and
i
looked
at
it.
when
we
came
back
from
the
hearing
of
judge
bohanon,
we
had
lost
this
case
in
a
trial
court.
judge
bohanon,
in
his
decision...
you
can
read
it
in
the
appendix--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--no,
your
honor,
you
don't.
it's
constantly
on
your
mind.
and
seriously,
you
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
sometimes
wondering,
when
am
i
supposed
to
file
it
and
am
i
going
to
get
it
done
on
time.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
well,
i
do.
and
you
just
do.
you
can
take
all
the
steps
that
you
want
to
to
try
to
get
it
docketed
on
time
and
you
still
want...
you
just
worry
until
it's
done.
and
usually
it
gets
done.
usually
there
is
no
problem.
but
you
want
to
also
focus
on
the
next...
the
next
step
and
so
we
then
started
to
focusing
on
the
appeal
after
judge
bohanon
ruled.
and
in
his
ruling,
he
says,
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind,
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
this
case.
and
he
said
that
immediately
after
he
said,
mr.
gray...
or
mr....
he
told
us
to
help
him
prepare
some
findings
of
fact
which
would
support
him.
his
very
next
sentence
is,
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind...
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
what
i'm
going
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
well,
then
we
get
the
letter
from
the
supreme...
from
the
court
of
appeals.
we
brief
it,
and
then
they
send
us
back
an
order
which
is
essentially
a
sentence
long
that
says,
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
because
the
announcement
was
not
a
final
decision
as
described
by
28
u.s.c.
1291.
the
announcement
was
not
final.
our
point
is...
well,
i
guess
we
have
really
two
points.
number
one,
it's
not
supposed
to
be
final.
there's
no
call
for
it
to
be
final.
the
rule
doesn't
require
it
to
be
final.
and
two,
in
our
case,
if
you
want
to...
if
you
want
to
write
the
word
"final"
into
the
rule,
this
was
a
final
decision.
it
disposed
of
all
of
the
issues.
it...
for
all
of
the
parties.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
final
decision.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think...
and
professor
moore...
i
agree
with
him
and
it
is
pointed
out
by
opposing
counsel...
professor
moore
says
rule
428
talks
about
announcement
which
will
result
in
an
final
decision
or
a
final
judgment.
i
think--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--well,
i
think
that
his
decision
was
reviewable
at
that
time,
because
he
didn't
have
to
enter...
he
could
have
changed
his
mind
and
just
said
i'm
just
not
going
to
do
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
we
did...
we
would
have...
everybody
would
want
to
see
a
journal
entry
entered,
so
you
would
have
the
30
days
start
to
run
from
that
time,
but
even
that
can
be
waived
by
the
parties,
as
the
bankers
trust
case--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--i
was
only--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--that's
correct.
i
think
that
under
an
extreme
circumstances
that
that
ruling
could
have
been
reviewable
at
that
time.
i
don't
think
it's
even
necessary
to
reach
that,
because
we
didn't...
i
truly
thought
that
we
were
going
to
have
a
journal
entry
of
judgment.
that
starts
our
time
to
run--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--yes,
your
honor.
and
an
oral
announcement
of
a
decision--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
no,
your
honor.
and
i'd--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--it
would
have
to
be
an
appealable
decision.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
interlocutory
or
collateral.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--or
something
like
that.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
that's
correct.
at
that
point,
the--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
follow.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
that's
correct.
and
that's
our
position
is
if
we
just...
if
you'll
let
us,
the
lawyers
that
are
trying
the
cases
and
appeal
them,
follow
the
rules
as
they're
written,
and
if
they're
enforced
as
they're
written,
then
they'll
be
effective
and
it
will
be...
make
my
job
a
lot
simpler.
this
court
is
committed
to
practical,
common
sense
construction
of
statutes
and
rules.
and
if
there
is
a...
if
there
is
any
way
to
interpret
a
rule
in
past
decisions,
you've
been
committed
to
the
rule
that
we
will
interpret
it
to
save
an
appeal,
not
to
facilitate
its
loss.
and
so
even
if
you
want
to...
even
if
you
have
to
interpret
this
rule,
i
think
that
that's
the
way
it
should
be
looked
at
first.
i
would
ask
the
court
to...
i
think
we're
more
or
less
committed
to
using
this
word
"final"
and
"finality"
as
it's
applied
to
judgments
and
so
forth.
but
then
to
try
to
apply
that
term
to
oral
announcements
is
really
going
to
cause
a
lot
of
problems.
wright
and
milliner,
talking
about
final
judgments
quoted
judge
frank
in
the
second
circuit
1942
and
he
said
this
term
finality
is
a
slithery,
tricky
word
and
there's
not
much
finality
to
the
definition
of
finality.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
it's...
and
has
called
it
a
twilight
zone,
the
use
of
the
word
finality
is
a
twilight
zone.
subject
to
perpetual
debate,
a
jungle
of
doubt...
those
words
have
been
used
about
the
word
"finality".
so
if
you
want
to...
that's
the
reason
i
suggested
earlier
that
the
word
"appealability"
is
a
lot
easier
to
deal
with
in
this
context
than
finality
is.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
well,
there
is...
there
is...
there
are
a
slim
bunch
of
cases
which
is
called
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
if
this
order
sounds
the
death
knell
for
the
case
regardless
of
whether
it's
final.
take
a
double
jeopardy
type
thing--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--well--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--yes,
your
honor.
in
our
simple
case
that
we
have
there,
that
is
absolutely
true.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes,
sir.
that
is
very
simply
our
position,
and
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
respectfully
propose
that
this
case
involved
two
basic
issues
to
this
appeal.
the
first
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
a
final
judgment,
under
section
1291
and
the
second
is
what
is
the
purpose
and
effect
of
rule
481
under
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure?
by
enacting
section
1291,
congress
mandated
that
appellate...
appellate
jurisdiction
be
limited
to
final
decisions.
this
evolved
into
what
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
final
judgment
rule,
which
requires
a
party
must
ordinarily
raise
all
claims
of
error
in
a
single
appeal
following
a
final
judgment
along
the
merits.
and
there's...
i
would
propose
that
there's
several
advantages
to
the
final
judgment
rule.
the
first
advantage
would
be
it
avoids
the
appellate
courts'
and
the
trial
courts'
looking
at
the
same
issue
at
the
same
time.
it
allows...
it
avoids
the
appellate
courts'
interference--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
just
one
point
on
rebuttal
and
it
kind
of
begs
the
question
because
i
don't
think
that
the
oral
announcement
had
to
be
final.
but
u.s.
v.
schaefer
brewing
company
we
learned
in
that
that
it's
a
find...
the
court
should
look
at
the
actions
of
all
the
parties
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
a
final
announcement.
and
for
that
reason
i--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--i
would
not
call
that
an
announcement
of
a
decision.
he's
telling
you
what
he
intends
to
do.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
and
i
would
not
call
that
a
decision.
i
think
you'd
have
to
wait
until
he
ruled.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
i
think
so,
sir.
and--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
even
he
doesn't
say
he
can
change
his
mind--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--he
can
change
his
mind.
he
can
change
his
mind
10
days
after
he
enters
the
judgment.
so
in
that
context,
it
isn't
final.
the
final
that
i'm
talking
about
is
does
it
dispose
of
all
the
issues,
does
it
dispose
of
all
the
parties...
that
type
of
finality.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes,
sir.
particularly--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--the
district
court
can
always
change
his
mind.
that
doesn't--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--well,
because
it...
well,
it's
not
final.
even
after
he
enters
the
judgment
as
i
said
earlier,
he
can
change
his
mind.
in
10
days...
within
10
days,
sui
sponte,
under
rule
59,
he
can
change
his
mind
and
completely
reverse
himself
without
a
motion.
and
so
under
that
concept,
whether
the
judge
can
change
his
or
her
mind,
it
shouldn't
fit
into
the
finality
formula.
the--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--yes,
sir.
there...
well,
the
last
segment
of
the
case.
there
are
some
what
i
would
call
ministerial
duties.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
that's
correct.
i
totally
agree
with
that.
and
as
i
said,
final
decision
doesn't
mean
it
can't
be
changed.
final--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--i
don't
think
it
is.
well--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
on
the
day
the
judgment
is
entered
and
that
is
what
you
really
appeal
from.
and
if
the
judgment
springs
from
the
oral
announcement
and
is
the
same--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
absolutely.
that's
what
you
appeal.
you
just
get
to
file
it
before
he
actually
enters
the
judgment
and
it
springs
to
life
as
he
files
it...
the
judgment.
if
he
changes
or
she
changes
her
mind
before
the
journal
entry
of
judgment
is
filed,
then
your
appeal
could
be
moot
or
you
may
have
to
file
a
new--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--file
your
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes,
sir.
and
then
when
he
or
she
files
that
journal
entry,
then
the
circuit
court...
it
becomes
effective--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--well--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--maybe
ministerial
was
a
poor
choice
of
words.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
and
it
seems
like
to
me
that
the
clerk
could
have
done
that
and
if
you
look
at
the
docket
sheet--
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
--yes,
sir,
i
think
that
the
clerk
could
have
done
that
in
this
case.
it
didn't
happen.
and
in
our
district
it
just
doesn't
happen.
the
clerk
just
doesn't
do
that.
i
don't
know
why,
but
they
just
don't.
mr.
jack
s.
dawson
yes.
but
that
just
isn't
our
practice
and
so
i
really
don't
have
any
experience
with
that.
but
under
the
rule
it
looks
like
that
could
have
happened
in
this
case.
if
there's
nothing
further,
then
i'm
through.
