--that's
correct,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
our
position
is
the
judgment
became
effective
on
march
3d
at
the
time
that
the
court
entered
its
memorandum
opinion
and
the
judgment
was
entered.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
what
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
was
just
advocating
some
policy
arguments
in
favor
of
the
single
judgment
rule.
if--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
might
just
briefly
make
a
few
statements
of
what
the
record
indicates
of
the
hearing
on
january
the
26th,
1989.
the
court
did
say,
i
find
that
the
policy
should
be
entered
cancelled
as
void
for
one
of
bad
faith
and
fraud.
however,
the
trial
court
asked
imi,
the
respondent,
to
submit
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
the
law,
which
were
not
required
but
nevertheless
the
court
requested
that.
and
the
trial
court
specifically
stated
on
the
record
that
it
will
look
to
what
imi
submits
as
suggestions,
as...
and
only
suggestions
only.
and
the
court
specifically
stated
that
it
reserved
the
right
to
modify,
add
to,
delete,
and
write
its
own
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--absolutely.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
can't
disagree
with
you,
your
honor.
i...
the
court
on
march
3d,
1989
entered
its
memorandum
of
appeal--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
it
did.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
submit
it
did
not.
it
didn't
say
this
was
a
final
decision--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--all--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
true.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
rule
4(a)(2)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
have
been
three...
the
lower
courts
have
apparently
taken
three
different
looks
at
4(a)(2).
the
first
was
that
at
any
time
that
a...
that
a
premature
appeal
to
a
nonfinal
order
will
be
firmed
up,
so
to
speak,
at
the
time
that
the
court
earns
its
final
order.
other
courts
have
taken
the
position
that
rule
4(a)(4)
is
the
only
exception
to
4(a)(2),
so
that...
so
that
when
you
have
tolling
motions
filed,
that
a
new
notice
appeal
has
be
filed
then.
i
would--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
propose
that
the
correct
rule
is
that
the
announcement
of
a
decision
can
only
be
an
announcement
of
the
final
decision,
and
the
purpose
of
4(a)(2)
is
when
you
do
not
have
either
the
separate
document
required
under
the
rule
4(a)(6)
or
a
delay
in
the
court's
filing
on
a
civil
docket
in
rule
4(a)(6).
the
reason
i
submit
that
is
the
commentary
says
that
rule
4(a)(2)
was
designed
to
afford
civil
litigants
the
protection
afforded
4(b)
under
the
criminal
procedure.
this
court
in
limpkey
held
that
when
a
defendant
was
convicted
and...
sentenced,
he
then
filed
a
notice
of
intent
to
appeal,
and
it
was
subsequently
entered...
the
tradition
was
subsequently
entered
on
the
clerk's
docket.
this
court
held
that
that
was
valid
appeal.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
that's
the
correct
interpretation
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--exactly,
under
rule
4(a)(6).
that's
what...
that's
what
we
would
propose
the
interpretation
of
rule
4(a)(2)
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
follow
you,
correct,
your
honor--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
the
literal
reading
of
the
rule.
and
it
also
purports--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
judge
can
always
modify
it.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
submit
it's
very
appropriate,
for
the
reason
is
the
trial
court
realizes
that
a
appellate
court
may
look
at
his
ruling
on
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
what
findings
of
fact
did
the
court
rely
upon
in
reaching
its
decision
and
what
statutory
case--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oftentimes
on
summary
judgment
there
may
be
an
interpretation
of
a
given
set
of
facts,
and
the
trial
court...
i
would
submit
the
trial
court
to
protect
the
record
might
want
to
enter
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
facts
are
undisputed,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
this
case
the
court
entered
i
believe
23
findings
of
fact
and
15
conclusions
of
law.
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
were
very
detailed
as
far
as
what
were
in
the
insurance
applications
and
what
was
relied
upon,
and
various
factual
basis.
i
would
anticipate
that
the
court
thought
that
it
was
going
up
on
appeal
and
give
some
guidance
to
the
tenth
circuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
submit
the
record
reflects
that
he
asked
for
findings
of
fact
from
imi.
firstier
proposed
their
findings
of
fact.
the
court
said
on
the
record
it
was
going
to
write
its
own
judgment
and
its
own
findings
of
fact,
which
it
apparently
did
on
march
3d.
and
that's
what
the
record
reflects.
i
would
submit
that
it...
that
the
court
did
not...
was
not
required
to
submit
findings
of
fact
on
a
ruling
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
but
in
this
case
it
did
so.
i
assume
it
felt
it
should
in
order
to
protect
the
record
on
appeal
that
the
tenth
circuit
was
going
to
be
looking
at
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
has
not.
the
oral
argument,
i
believe,
was
held
in
may
of
this
year
and
the...
it
has
been
briefed,
oral
argument
was
held
in
may,
and
we've
heard
nothing
from
the
tenth
circuit
on
the
subsequent
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
that
potential,
because
the
tenth
circuit
could
rule
on
merits
at
any
time,
i
assume.
we've
heard
nothing
from
the
tenth
circuit
with
regard
to
that
second
appeal.
well,
to
conclude
we
would...
we
would
ask
the
court
to
follow
that
interpretation
with
respect
to
rule
4(a)(2).
and
if
the
justices
have
no
further
questions--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you.
