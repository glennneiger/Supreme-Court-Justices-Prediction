unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
is
there
any
danger
of
both
courts
having
jurisdiction
at
the
same
time?
unknown
speaker
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
because
it
was
at
least...
i
think
you
just
agreed
to
that,
because
the
only
relevant
date
is
the
march
3d
date.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
isn't
that
true
of
every
case
covered
by
this
rule,
that
when
an
oral
announcement
is
made,
the
judge
can
always
change
his
mind?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
case
does
the
rule
cover
if
it
doesn't
cover
this
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
on...
earlier
than
that,
on
january
26th,
it
made
an
oral
announcement,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
did
it
make
an
oral
announcement
within
the
meaning
of
this
rule?
unknown
speaker
but
the
rule
doesn't
require
him
to
say
it's
a
final
decision.
unknown
speaker
the
word
"final"...
final
doesn't
appear
on
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
point
of
the
rule,
if
it
isn't
just
postpone
the
effective
date
of
the
notice
until
after
the
decision
becomes
final?
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
rule
is
intended
to
do?
unknown
speaker
rule
4(a)(2),
yes.
unknown
speaker
4(a)(4)
isn't
involved.
we
don't
have
a
tolling
motion
here--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
agree...
you
would
in
effect
treat
the
rule
as
though
it
read
instead
of
after
the
announcement
of
a
decision
or
order,
after
the
announcement
of
a
final
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
before
the
formal
entry
of
the
judgment
it
shall--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
suppose
you
would
make
the
argument
that
if
that
isn't
what
it
means,
it
would
not
continue
"but
before
the
entry
of
the
judgment
or
order.
"
it
would
say
but
before...
"but
before
the
final
judgment
shall
be
treated
after
such
final
judgment.
"
unknown
speaker
if
they
didn't
mean
a
final...
if
they
didn't
mean
a
final
decision
or
order
in
the
first
part
of
4(a)(2),
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
refer
to
entry
of
the
judgment
or
order
in
the
second
part.
they
could
have
just
said
final
judgment
in
the
second.
unknown
speaker
but
even
in
that
could
any
such
decision
or
order
would
be
really
final?
if
it's
before
the
judgment
is
entered,
the
judge
can
always
modify
it,
couldn't
he?
before--
unknown
speaker
--so,
it
would
never
be
final.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
customary
for
a
district
court,
at
least
in
your
practice,
in
oklahoma
city,
to
order
the
making
of
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
when
he
decides
to
grant
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
limited
to
cases
where
there
were
no
disputed
questions
of
fact,
that
the
district
court...
if
the
district
court
has
to
find
the
fact
on
any
sort
of
conflicting
evidence,
then
it's
not
appropriate
for
summary
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
may
not
be
disputed
facts
but
there
are
certainly
facts
on
a
summary
judgment.
how
can
you
decide
a
question
of
law
without
knowing
what
those
facts
are?
if
there's
a...
so
for
everybody...
what
they
in
effect...
the
court's
going
to
say
to
grant
summary
judgment
is
that
everybody
is
agreed
about
what
the
facts
are.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
i
presume
everyone
of
those
factual...
it
was
really
factual
statements
by
the
district
court.
he
wasn't
finding
on
the
basis
of
conflicting
evidence,
but
he
was
just
setting
forth
the
facts
that
the
parties
agreed
were
facts.
wouldn't
that
be
the
case
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
i
take
the
tenth
circuit
has
not
ruled
on
the
pending
appeal
with
reference
to
the
second
filing?
unknown
speaker
there
is
the
potential
that
if
we
ruled,
our
ruling
would
be
moot.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dawson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
what
final...
well,
your
approach
to
4(a)(2)
requires
us
to
decide
what
is
an
announcement,
that
is,
you
say
there
can
be
an
announcement
that
is
not
a
final
announcement.
well,
suppose
the
judge
says
i
intend
to
rule
this
way
on
the
matter.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
enough.
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
a
current
ruling?
unknown
speaker
but
not
necessarily
a
final
rule?
i
mean,
he
says
you
know,
i'm
ruling
this
way.
i
may
change
my
mind
before
i
enter
it,
but
for
the
time
being
that's
my
ruling.
is
that
an
announcement?
unknown
speaker
it
is,
even
though
he
can
still
change
his
mind?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
even
though
findings
of
fact
on
contested
issues
and
possible
objections
to
them
and
the
district
court
changing
his
mind
after
he
sees
the
objection?
unknown
speaker
well,
then...
then
it
really
doesn't
sound
terribly
final,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
something
still
incomplete
to
be
done
there,
a
whole
segment
of
a
case
to
be
finished.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
findings
of
fact
certainly
are
necessarily
ministerial
duties.
the
judge
can
rule
for
you
from
the
bench
and
yet
you've
given
it...
questions
of
fact
and
maybe
the
plaintiff
wants
one
set
of
facts
found,
the
defendant
wants
another.
and
the
trial
judge
looks
back
at
his
notes,
maybe
as
a
transcript,
and
he
doesn't
go
along
with
the
plaintiff
on
some
of
the
findings
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
and...
because
you
say
the
rule
can...
under
the
rule
what
you're
appealing
is
the
judgment
when
he
enters
it.
unknown
speaker
because
the
rule
says
the...
your
prior
filing
will
be
considered
filed
on
the
day
the
judgment
is
entered.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
aren't
appealing.
you
aren't...
you're
really
in
effect...
under
the
rule
you
aren't
appeal
his
oral
announcement.
you're
appealing--
unknown
speaker
--his
final
judgment.
unknown
speaker
all
he
has
to
do
is
say,
listen,
here's
my
bottom
line.
you
win;
you
lose.
i
will
tell
you
why
later.
unknown
speaker
then
you
can
file
your--
unknown
speaker
--right
then
and
there
and
wait
for
a
year,
waiting
on
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
but
you
certainly
can't
say
that
what
he
has
to...
you
have
to
do
after
his
oral
announcement
is
just
ministerial,
like
just
making
up
a
piece
of
paper
and
filing
it.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
isn't
ministerial.
it's...
he's
going...
you
fellows
are
going
to
have
to
do
a
lot
of
work
and
the
judge
is
going
to
have
to
do
a
lot
of
work.
he
says
i
may
revise
or
i
may
not
take
any
of
your
submissions.
i
may
make
my
own.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case
where
the
clerk
without
awaiting
the
direction
of
a
court
can
enter
judgment
under
rule
58,
or
was
it?
was
it
a
judgment
which
denied
all
relief?
unknown
speaker
acting
under
rule
58?
unknown
speaker
58
talks
about
a
decision.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
