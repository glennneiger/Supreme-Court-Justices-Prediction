justice
scalia
but
they're...
but
they're
not
exclusive.
they're
not
like
the
seven
dwarves.
[laughter]
the
statute
says
totality
of
the
circumstances--
justice
scalia
--and
presumably
any
other
circumstances
can
be
brought
in,
right?
justice
scalia
and
it...
the
senate
rejected
it?
justice
scalia
you
mean
the
senate
committee?
justice
scalia
the
senate
committee--
justice
scalia
--didn't
think
it
was
good.
but
the
senate
adopted
language
that
it
said
totality
of
the
circumstances.
justice
scalia
which
is
pretty
all
inclusive,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
sure--
justice
scalia
--so
they
are
included
within
totality,
but
everything
else
is
included
within
totality
as
well.
justice
scalia
you
say
the
question
is
whether
it
limits.
and
i
assume
you
heard
the
previous
argument.
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question
that
we
asked
general
starr...
that
is
limits
as
compared
to
what?
you...
you
need
something
to
compare
with
whether...
whether
the
minorities
are
being
treated
unequally
as
compared
to
some
standard.
what...
what
is
the
standard
that
you're...
that
you're
proposing?
justice
scalia
so
you...
you
would
one-person,
one-vote
essentially
as
the
standard--
justice
scalia
--or
the
measuring...
measuring
device
whether
it's
constitutionally
required
or
not.
justice
scalia
all
right,
so
it
is
your
position
that
one-person,
one-vote
is
the
standard.
whether
it's
constitutionally
required
or
not,
you're
saying
that
congress
adopted
that
in
2(b).
justice
scalia
yes,
but
if...
there
may
be
wide
differences
in
the
population
of
the
districts
that
elect,
say,
the
louisiana
judges.
but
if
there
aren't
any
minorities
in
any
of
those
districts,
section
2
doesn't
even
come
into
the
picture.
justice
scalia
--i'm
not
trying...
really,
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
what
your
position
is.
i
can
understand
one
standard
and
that's
one-person,
one-vote.
another
standard
that's
been
suggested
which
you...
which
you
also
refuse
to
adopt...
you
say
it
may
be
used
but
then
again
it
may
not...
is
not
one-person,
one-vote,
but
the
minority
should
not
have
any
less
voting
power
than...
than
the
most
deprived
nonminority
group
in
the
state.
if
you
have
some
the
district
that's
1
to
300
as
long
as
the
minority
has
at
least
that,
it's
okay.
now,
those
are
two
standards,
and
i
understand
both
of
those.
but
i
don't
understand...
you
reject
each
of
those
as...
as
the
standard.
justice
scalia
what...
what
is
the
standard
you
are
using?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
right.
i'm
talking
about
the
first
question.
what
is
the
standard
for
determining
a
violation?
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean
if
they
are
submerged?
and
to
determine
whether
they
are
submerged
you
look
to
what?
the--
justice
scalia
--the
greatest
proportion
that
the
state
has
in
any
of
the
districts,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
well,
you're
using
a
one...
one-person,
one-vote
standard.
justice
scalia
so
you'd
apply
it
with...
you'd
apply
one-person,
one-vote
within
the
unit?
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
what
is
it...
what
is
it
legislative
due
process?
i
thought
congress
just
has
to
enact
statutes.
they...
they
must
think
about
them
before
they
enact
them?
[laughter]
i
don't
think
there's
any
such
principle,
is
there?
justice
scalia
or...
or
goes
further
than...
than
it
seems.
justice
scalia
does
this
have
to
be
floor
consideration
that
congress
gives
to
it
or
just
intensive
committee
consideration?
justice
scalia
no
matter
how
clear
the
language
is.
justice
scalia
if
we
think
they
didn't
think
about
it
enough,
it's
ineffective.
justice
scalia
well,
if
you
apply
a
clarity
test
here,
i
don't
know
why
you're
just
complaining
about
judges
being
covered.
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
that
it's
entirely
clear
that
to
elect
representatives
of
your
choice
means
to
elect
the
governor
of
your
choice.
do
you
think
a
governor
is
clearly
a
representative?
justice
scalia
you
don't
then
now
deny
that
the
governor
is
covered
do
you?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
he
excluded
under
your
theory?
justice
scalia
whoever.
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--well,
it
seems
to
me
you're
make...
it
doesn't
matter
whether
i
like
legislative
history
or
not,
but
you're
mixing
two
theories
here.
if
you're
saying
it
has
to
be
said
with
clarity,
then
it
hasn't
been
said
with
clarity
with
respect
to
a
lot
of
officers
besides
judges...
a
lot
of
officers
besides
judges.
and
you
say
as
to
each
of
them,
we
have
to
go
back
and
pour
through
the
legislative
history
to
see
if
they're
covered?
justice
scalia
elected
clerks
of
court,
for
example,
if
there's
an...
an
election
for
the
clerk
of
court--
justice
scalia
--is...
is
that
explicitly
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
scalia
mr.
hicks,
is
it
your
position
that
section
2
in
its
entirely
doesn't
apply
to
judges...
not
at
all?
2(a)
doesn't
have
any
application
either?
justice
scalia
of
course,
one
of
the
respondents
here
says
that
there
is
more
in
section
1
than
just
the
intentional
discrimination
test
that...
that...
that
you
can
say
that
all
that
section
2(b)
contains
is
the
dilution
requirement.
and
that
the
result
test,
apart
from
the
dilution
requirement,
can
be
found
in
2(a).
justice
scalia
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
scalia
that's
judge...
judge
ents
if
you
recall
his
submission
here.
justice
scalia
so
a
state
could
disenfranchise
any
minority
so
long
as
it's
willing
to
pay
the
price
of...
of
giving
the
decision
in
question
to
a
single
official.
justice
scalia
or
so
long
as
it
has
been
willing
in
the
past.
justice
scalia
you
could
replace
a
school
board
with
a
single
school
administrator.
justice
scalia
and
there...
and
there
could
be
no
complaint
about
that
diluting
the
minority
vote.
justice
scalia
and
you'd
apply
different
tests
there?
justice
scalia
it's
not
covered
by
section
2.
justice
scalia
oh,
you
have
to
take
my
hypotheticals.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
i
make
them
up
myself.
you
have
to
take
them.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
the
court
imposed
that
you
mean?
