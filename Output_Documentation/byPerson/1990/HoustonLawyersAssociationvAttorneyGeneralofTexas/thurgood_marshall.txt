be
easy
to
figure

applies
to
all
votes?
don't
votes
mean
votes?
justice
marshall
isn't
a
vote
for
a
judge
the
same
as
a
vote
for
a
legislator
or
a
vote
for
a
dog
catcher?
justice
marshall
well,
why
does
the
average
person
think
of
it
that
way?
justice
marshall
well,

do
they
think
the

is
restricted
to
what?

what
office
is
it
restricted
to?

they
think
that
they
all...
a
vote
is
a
vote?

marshall
where
do
you
get
the...
look
how
many
years
it
took
them
to
draw
this
line.
justice
marshall
how
many
years
did
it
take
louisiana
to
figure
that

weren't
included?

marshall
'80...
wasn't
it
'82?
justice
marshall
the
bill...
the
voting
rights
bill
was
passed,
they
didn't
think
judges
were
included?
justice
marshall
well,
when
did
they
suddenly
decide
to
litigate
it?

somebody
had
to
dig
way
down
to
figure--
justice
marshall
is
there
any
other
officer
that's
in
the
category
of
judges...
any
other
elected
officer?
justice
marshall
uh-huh.
justice
marshall
well,
where
did
they
get
that
unique
place
from?

marshall
well,

want
us
to
make
the
exception?
