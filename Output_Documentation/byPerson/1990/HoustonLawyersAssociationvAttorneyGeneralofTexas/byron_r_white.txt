justice
white
i
suppose
the...
you're
really
arguing
a
question
of
remedy,
i
suppose,
in
a
way.
would...
do
you
think
the
remedy
question
if
before
us?
justice
white
do
you
think...
so
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
counties
in
texas
much
be
subdivided
into
one-judge
districts,
that
isn't...
that
isn't
the
question
before
us.
justice
white
i
would
think
that
from
what
you
said
that
you
would
say
that
that
would
be
the...
that
would
have
to
be
what
the
remedy
is.
justice
white
what...
what
was
it
you
disagreed
with
the
solicitor
general
on?
justice
white
but
i
don't...
i
don't
suppose
that
we
really...
that
we
really
need
to
pass
on
this...
your...
the
disagreement
between
you
and
the
solicitor
general.
justice
white
well,
i
would...
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
question
of
remedy
though.
justice
white
yes,
yes,
although
the
one-man,
one-vote
principle
would
certainly
get
to
it.
justice
white
but
your...
section
2
requires
dealing
with
the
claim
that
minority
voting
interest
is
depreciated.
justice
white
and
that
may
not
be...
that
may
not
correct
every
disparity
in
population
between
districts.
justice
white
well,
mr.
chambers--
--could
i
ask...
could
i
ask
you,
we're
reviewing...
we're
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
i
take
it,
and
that
decision
was
that
section
2
just
doesn't
cover
judges.
justice
white
so
it
never
got
around
to...
to
saying,
well,
yes,
it
does
cover
it,
but
there...
and
then
decide
whether
there's
been
a
violation.
justice
white
so
if
we...
if
we
agree
with
you,
i
would
think
we
would
just
tell
the
fifth
circuit
they
were
wrong
in
saying
section
2
doesn't
cover
it.
and
then...
then
it's
going
to
be
up
to
them
to
decide
whether
there's
been
a
violation.
justice
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
white
so
there
has
to
be
a
remand
if
we
agree
with
you.
justice
white
so
you
think
he's
still
talking
about
coverage?
justice
white
i
can't
believe
that.
i
didn't
think
he
was
in...
suggesting
a
remand,
that
he
was
suggesting
a
remand
as
to
reconsider
coverage.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
in
using
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
decide
whether
there's
been
a
violation.
justice
white
but
they...
those
cases
did...
did
hold
that
judges
are
covered
by
section
2(a)?
justice
white
if
there...
if
there
was
some
debate
about
it
and...
and
you
know
that
they
had
it
in
mind,
but
nevertheless
they
used
the
word
"representative".
justice
white
so
you
think
"representative"
is
capable
of
covering
judges
[inaudible]--
justice
white
their
names
both
begin
with
j,
though.
justice
white
that's
all...
i...
you...
i
take
it
you...
then
you
aren't
defending
the
judgment...
you're
defending
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
but
not
its
reasoning.
is
that
it?
justice
white
we
agreed
to
view...
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
there's
a
different
standard
for
judging
coverage
than
the
fifth
circuit
used.
justice
white
so
we
would
have
to
remand.
