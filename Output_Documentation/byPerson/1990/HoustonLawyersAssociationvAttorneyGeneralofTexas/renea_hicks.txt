mr.
renea
hicks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wish
to
address
both
the
question
of
coverage
and
the
question
of
the
inapplicability,
not
an
exemption,
but
the
inapplicability
of
vote
dilution
at-large
challenges
to
trial
judges,
the
solo
decision
makers.
and
i
first
want
to
address
the
question
of
coverage.
much
to
the
chagrin
of
much
of
the
texas
judiciary,
many
of
the
people
that
have
intervened
on
my
case,
i
do
not...
i
anticipate
mr.
pugh...
i
do
not
adopt
the
theory
of
noncoverage
that
louisiana
has
adopted
or
that
the
fifth
circuit
adopted.
we
argued
below
that
the
plain
statement
principle
was
the
way
to
approach
it.
the
problem
is
not
that
"representative"
clearly
excludes
judges.
it's
that
the
use
of
the
word
"representative"
doesn't
clearly
include
them.
there
is
ambiguity
there.
there
is
also
some
ambiguity
i
believe
in
the
question
of
whether
section
2(a)
of
the
voting
rights
act
covers
intentional
discrimination.
i
think
it
was
justice
scalia,
but
i'm
not
sure
who
pointed
out,
that
the
language
certainly
doesn't
say
anything
about
intent.
the
language
of
section
2(a)
only
talks
about
results.
and
i
don't
believe
there's
the
slightest
indication
that
congress
meant
to
do
away
with
the
intent
standard
in
1982.
but
it
appears
that
they
did.
of
course,
there
is
the
protection
of
the
constitution
there.
it's
been
there
since
1870
or
1868,
depending
on
whether
you
use
the
fifteenth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
nonetheless
there
may
not
be
an
intent
standard
in
section
2
anymore
if
you
read
the
language
literally.
if
you
choose
not
to
read
the--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i'm
willing
to
accept
that.
i'm
just
saying--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well--
mr.
renea
hicks
--there
is
a
problem
about
causation.
and
a
part
of
that
comes
up
in
the
proof
in
this
case
about
the
role
of
partisan
voting
patterns.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
and...
and
i...
i
believe
the
proper
reading
is
that
there
still
is
an
intent
standard.
there's
no
indication
that
they
intended
to
do
away
with
it.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
about
whether
the
statute
is
so
clear
you
can
tell
it
covers
judges.
i
disagree
with
one
of
the
justices
who
answered
that
the
court...
and
i
think
it
was
justice
white...
who
answered
that
the
court
had
decided
that
the
original
section
2
in
1965
covered
judges.
the
court
has
never
decided
that.
the
court
has
never
addressed
that
question.
in
mobile
v.
bolden,
without
considering
coverage
of
judges,
the
court
in
rather
an
offhand
manner...
i
don't
mean
the
analysis
was
offhand,
but
the
state...
the
use
of
the
language
was
offhand
i
believe...
in
rather
offhand
manner
said
that
section
2
is
coextensive
with
the
fifteenth
amendment.
in
rogers
v.
lodge
2
years
later,
it
was
stated
differently.
the
court
said
section
2
reaches
no
further
than
the
fifteenth
amendment.
there
is
a
difference
there,
and
it's
an
importance
difference
for
the
analysis
of
this
case.
if
you
go
back
to
1965,
as
mobile
v.
bolden
pointed
out,
the
legislative
history
on
section
2
is
sparse.
this
court
has
noted
that
there
is
extensive
debate
in
the
60...
during
the
'65
on
the
preclearance
provisions,
the
rules
about
doing
away
with
literacy
test,
the
rules
about
access
to
the
poll
question
that
were
such
a
horror
in
the
south
at
that
point.
and
it...
it's
clear
that
in
1965
congress
was
trying
to
do
away
with
a
lot
of
those
horrors.
but
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
in
1965
addressed
judges
in
section
2.
it
didn't
even
think
about
it.
it
didn't
even
think
about
it
in
1960...
in
1982
either.
and
in
1982,
congress
was
using
a
power,
the
enforcement
clause
power,
which
is
a
much
more
hemmed-in
power,
i
would
say,
than
the...
its
power
to
straight
out
announce
what
the
constitution
covers
under
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
section
1
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
so
during
the
17
years,
from
1965
to
1982,
there
is
no...
there's
no
empirical
evidence
that
section
2
covered
judges.
there
was
not
a
single
statutory
section
2
case
involved...
vote
dilution
case
involving
judges
reported
anywhere
in
the
annals
of
these
cases.
there
is
not
a
single
effects
standard
case
involving
judges,
either
under
the
constitution
or
the
statute,
during
that
17-year
period.
there
was
one
case...
fifth
circuit
case
that
was
dismissed.
there
was
no
trial
of
it.
the...
12
beat
6
dismissal
at
the
trial
court
level.
and
then
it
gets
up
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
then...
the
only
provisions
mentioned
are
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
and
the
only
challenges
are
clearly
intent
challenges.
they
aren't,
however
it
may
in
retrospect
be
read
to
me,
they
are
not
white
v.
regester
kinds
of
challenges.
and
so--
mr.
renea
hicks
--they
didn't
address
it.
there's
no
mention
of
it.
there's
not
a
single
case.
the
only
things
back
in
that
era...
the
17-year
era
of
whatever
the
original
section
2
meant...
the
only
cases
around
was
an
intentional...
constitute
clearly
intentional...
no
debate
about
it...
and
constitutional
case
on
vote
dilution
about
judges.
then
the
other
things
that
came
up
were
the
court's
summary
affirmances
of
the
rule
that
one-person,
one-vote
does
not
apply
to
judges.
you
get
to
1982,
congress
wants
to
reinstitute
the
pre-bolden
rule
as
it
reads
it.
it
has
to
use
its
enforcement
powers
under
the
civil
rights
amendment
to
do
that.
and
it
is
not
free
to
do
anything
it
wants
when
it
does
that.
it
is
not
free
to
not
deliberate
and
just
announce
a
rule.
it
has
to
deliberate.
that's
what
katzenbach
v.
morgan,
oregon
v.
mitchell
say
it
has
to
do.
it
may
not
have
to
deliberate
like
a
trial,
make
a
court
record,
and
things
like
that.
but
it
at
least
has
to...
in
death
of
a
salesman
it
talks
about
attention
must
be
paid.
it
must
pay
some
attention
to
what
it's
doing.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
think...
well,
the
premise
of
katzenbach
v.
morgan
and
its
progeny
is,
yes,
congress
does
have
to
think
about
them,
if
it's
enacting
statutes
that
go
further
than
this
court
has
announced
the
constitution
goes.
it
doesn't...
if
you
want
to
say
it
this
way...
it
doesn't
have
to
think
about
it
if
it's
enacting
a
statute
that
governs
federal
employee
relations.
it
doesn't.
i...
you
don't
have
to...
as
i
think
you've
said
so
often...
if
the
plain
language
covers
it,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
whether
they
thought
about
it.
whether
they
thought
about
it
the
right
way
and
all
that,
you
don't
go
behind
it.
but
things
are
different
when
you
get
into
the
realm
of
the
enforcement
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
they
aren't
different,
then
katzenbach
v.
morgan
is
not
good
law.
but
katzenbach
v.
morgan
i
believe
is
good
law.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
i
can
only
have
the
words.
i
don't
write
the
opinions,
so
i
can
only
tell
from
its
words
and
the
way
it's
been
applied
that
it
is
premised
on
the
idea
that
there
is
some
peculiar
ability
within
congress
which
is
known
as
the
world's
greatest
deliberative
body
to
deliberate
about
what
it's
doing.
and
you
will
find
no
indication...
a
few
smatterings...
back...
way
back
in
hearings
buried
in
a
table,
there
might
be
a
listing
of
a
judge.
so
that's
usually
about
section
5
coverage.
but
there
may
be
a
few
smatterings
that
something
about
judges
will
sit,
but
once
you
move
past
that...
once
you
get
into
the
area
where
this
court
pays
some
attention
to
legislative
history...
that
is,
into
the
committee
reports,
into
the
debate
about
the
bill
on
the...
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
senate,
there
is
nothing.
and
in
the--
mr.
renea
hicks
--it
has
to
be...
it
doesn't
even
have
to
be
intensive
committee
consideration,
but
some
consideration.
there
has
to
be
some
attention
paid,
and
there's
none
here.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
the
language
here
is
not--
mr.
renea
hicks
--the
hardest
question
for
me
is
if
they
had
said...
added
the
phrase
including
judges
here...
in
section
2(b).
that
would
be
the
hardest
question
for
me.
i
think
it
would
be
a
closer
question.
but
it
isn't
close
here.
i
don't
adopt
the
view
that
representatives
clearly
excludes
judges.
but
i
do
adopt
a
view
to
you
that
it's
at
least
ambiguous...
at
least.
we
know
that
they
weren't
thinking
about
it.
you
can
tell
it's
ambiguity
if
you
go
look
at
the
senate
report.
all
of
those
23
cases
that
you
don't
want
to
read
in
the
senate
report
have
to
do
with
executive
and
legislative
arms
of
the
government,
and
not
a
single
judge's
case.
they
don't
even
address
the
problem
of
one-person,
one-vote.
at
least
our
state
judicial
systems,
if
they're
going
to
be
intruded
on
through
the
enforcement
clause
powers,
deserve
to
have
it
considered--
mr.
renea
hicks
--not
just
stumbling
over
them.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
guess
it's
more
intrusive,
because
it's
more
unexpected.
it
seems
intrusive
to
us.
we
didn't
expect
it.
congress
didn't
ever
indicate
to
our
legislators.
no...
nobody
knew
that
it
was
happening.
it's--
mr.
renea
hicks
--just
something
that
happened
through
the
use
of
universal
language.
justice
holmes,
back
in
1909,
in
the
american
banana
case,
said
there's
a
lot
of
use
of
universal
language
in
statutes.
no...
no
such
and
such
will
ever
happen.
every
particular
event
shall
be
covered.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
later
everything
that
might
be
trapped
by
that
language
is
trapped.
and
i
think
it
is
most
important
for
your--
mr.
renea
hicks
--it
would
be
a--
mr.
renea
hicks
--as
a
matter
of
fact
it
isn't
the
same.
the
vote
weighs
the
same--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
don't
think
so...
not
in
texas.
the
average
person--
[laughter]
mr.
renea
hicks
they
know
they
vote
for
judges.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
that
isn't
even
true.
all
texas
don't
know
they
vote
for
judges.
mr.
renea
hicks
excuse
me?
mr.
renea
hicks
as
used
by
congress?
mr.
renea
hicks
the
normal...
a
normal
person
in
louisiana
or
texas?
mr.
renea
hicks
they
vote...
they
actually
vote
for
all
these
people.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
believe
so,
but
by
and
large--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand.
mr.
renea
hicks
well--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i'm
sorry.
i--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
don't
believe
anybody
thought
judges
were
included.
there
was
no
case--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
when
they
were
sued
they
had
to
litigate
it,
because
they
didn't
anticipate
this.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
did
take
a
long
time,
and
i
think
that's
more
an
indication--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
i
think
it
works
the
other
way,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect.
i
think
what
that
indicates
is
the
plaintiffs
didn't
think
they
were
covered.
they
didn't
sue.
there
weren't
any
vote
dilution
effects
test
suits
until
after
1982.
and
if
section
2
originally
had
covered
it...
given
the
claims
that
the
state
judicial
system
is
the
last
bastion
of
white
supremacy
in
the
south
which
i
don't
think
is
so...
but
given
that
claim
and
given
the
claim
that
it
is
such
a
crucial
institution,
i
would
have
thought
that
would
have
been
the
primaries
of
focus,
but
it
was
not.
mr.
renea
hicks
there--
mr.
renea
hicks
--the
court...
this
court
has
summarily
held
that.
i
don't
know
if
it
did
it
because
there
was
an
intent
prong
involved
or
effects
prong
in
the
challenges
that
came
up.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
doesn't
seem
odd
to
me,
your
honor,
because
the
attention
at
the
trial
court
level
was
about
change.
i
mean...
i'm
sorry...
at
the
congressional
level
in
1965...
was
about
change.
it
was
about
section
5.
that's
what
the
focus
was
on.
and
if
congress
was
using
its
enforcement
clause
powers
to--
mr.
renea
hicks
--yes,
you
have
without,
giving
plenary
review
to
that
question
and
without
looking
carefully
at
the
legislative
history...
i'm
guessing...
the
issue
wasn't
presented
to
you
that
way
at
any
rate.
and
i
do
believe
that
is
very
crucial
for
our
case
for
the
court
to
recognize
that
when
congress...
when...
it
is
construing
a
statute
enacted
by
congress,
they...
it's
under
its
enforcement
clause
powers
and
goes
beyond
the
constitution
as
announced
by
this
court
that
there
are
some
different
rules
of
construction
that
apply
than
if
it
is
enacting
something
like
a
federal
employee
relations
act.
there
is
a
different
set
of
rules.
justice
marshall
wrote
an
opinion
in
a
dissent
from
the
aramco
decision
about
the
extraterritorial
application
of
title
vii.
the
broad
wording
in
title
vii
clearly
reached,
it
seems
to
me...
i
know
the
court
said
that
it
was
ambiguous...
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
clearly
reached
american
employees
working
for
american
companies
in
saudi
arabia.
the
court
found
a
difference
between
broad
and
being
specific--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
think--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i'm
not,
no.
according--
mr.
renea
hicks
--she
in
our
case.
[laughter]
mr.
renea
hicks
because...
because
if...
you're
thrown
back
into
the
legislative
history
to
some
extent.
i
know
you
don't
like
that,
but
i
believe
you
are.
and
in
gingles,
you...
the
court
has
looked
at
the
legislative
history
and
it
is
clear
that
every...
the
arms
of
the
executive
and
legislative
branch
were
meant
to
be
brought
within
it.
mr.
renea
hicks
they're
discussed
extensively.
mr.
renea
hicks
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
think
it's
covered.
the
legislative
history
covers
about
just
every
officer
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
it.
i
do
think
that
judges
are
different.
i
think
that's
part
of
the
reason
for
the
argument
for
the
solicitor...
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
made.
they
acknowledge
that
the
judges...
that
judges
are
different.
i
actually
believe
that
petitioners
have
acknowledged
that
judges
are
different.
mr.
renea
hicks
they're--
mr.
renea
hicks
--it
is
an
executive
function
and
i
believe
clerks...
i
don't
know
if
they're
clerks
of
court...
were
certainly
the
object
of
section
2
and
section
5
claims,
pre-1982.
so
i
believe
they're
covered.
i
believe
another
indication
that
judges
aren't
covered
is
this...
1982
the
amendments
were
intended
to
restore
the
pre-bolden
status
of
the
case
law
as
congress
read
it.
mr.
renea
hicks
do
you
mean
the
category
of
judges
as
i
would
place
the
category
of
judges?
mr.
renea
hicks
no,
i...
the...
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
believe
that
this
court
has
historically
recognized
their
unique
place.
it
is...
this
court
has
an
interdependent
relationship
with
trial
judges
at
the
state
court
level
and
with
all
judges
at
state
court
level.
it
relies
on
them
for
a
lot
of
rules
that
it
must
apply.
it
relies
on
trial
court
judges
to
take
care
of
a
lot
of
federal
constitutional
issues.
it
relies
on
trial
court
judges
and
other
state
court
judges
to
address,
it
seems
to
me,
a
lot
of
issues
that
will
relieve
the
court
of
a
lot
of--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
believe
that
in
the
area
of
federalism
the
court
has
done
this
kind
of
thing
before.
it
has
elevated
trial
court
judges...
state
court
judges,
excuse
me...
to
a
little
different
level.
mr.
renea
hicks
there
is
no
question
about
that,
and
that's
one
reason
they're
entitled
to
some
special
insulation
from
encroachments
under
the
enforcement
clause
powers
under
the
civil
war
amendments.
that
is
the
reason
they
have
to
be
attended
to
some
extent.
they've
just
been
stumbled
across
here.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
just
think
it
has
to
deliberate
over
it.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
there
has
to
be
some
deliberation.
i
think
that
state
court
judicial
systems
are
important
enough
to
deserve
some
attention
from
congress.
congress
makes
the
ultimate
judgment
on
whether
it
wants
to
extend
its...
the
constitution
to
reach
down
into
the
arms
of
the
state
government
that
are
traditionally
off
limits.
but
it
should
exercise
that
judgment.
it
shouldn't
stumble
across
it.
it
shouldn't
be
an
accident.
surely
our
state
court
judicial
systems
are
worthy
of
more
attention
than
that.
and
i
believe--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
that
would
be
closer.
i
think
i
might
lose
that
case,
but
they
didn't
have
it
in
mind--
mr.
renea
hicks
--it's
capable
of
it.
i
don't
think
common
people
think
of
judges
as
representatives.
i
don't
think
a
lot
of
informed
scholars
think
of
judges
as
representatives.
i
don't
think
judges
think
of
themselves
as
representatives.
i
agree
that
under
some...
jeffersonian
democracy
theory
that
they're
representative
of
the
people.
i
don't
question
that
at
all.
mr.
renea
hicks
is
it
jacksonian?
well--
[laughter]
i'm
talking
about
the
idea
of
what
a
representative
is.
mr.
renea
hicks
thank
you.
i
didn't
read
my
amicus
briefs
as
well
as
i
should
have.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
[laughter]
i
actually
was
thinking
about
what
i
said
and
i
did
mean
jeffersonian
because
the
idea
of
anybody
that's
elected
is
a
representative
in
some
sense...
that
kind
of
theory.
but
at
the
normal
common
parlance
does
not
speak
of
judges
as
representatives.
the
courts...
lower
courts
have...
have
in
a
sense
stumbled
across
that
when
they
refer
to
judges
as
not
being
representatives.
and
so--
mr.
renea
hicks
--that's
correct.
we
made
this
argument
that
i'm
making
now
below.
i
have
to
say
i
don't
think
it
was
as
sophisticated
as
it
is
now--
mr.
renea
hicks
--yes.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
understand.
this...
this
is
a
legal
question,
not
a
factual
question.
i
believe
ultimately
if
you
disagree
with
me,
you
must
remand.
but
i
don't
believe
on
the
question
of
coverage
you
must
remand.
i...
i
think
this
court
is
quite
capable
of
analyzing
this
on
the
legal
grounds
that
i've
argued
here
and
reaching
a
decision.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
answer
that
question
in
this
case,
because
we've
been
found
not
to
discriminate
intentionally,
but
i
think
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
in
1965
congress
intended
to
get
at
judges.
i
also
think
though
the
test
for
how
much
they
had
to
have
paid
attention
is
different
for
1965
because
they
weren't
exercising
their
enforcement
clause
powers
under
section
2,
as
bolden
has
seen
it
in
retrospect.
they
were
just
announcing...
regurgitating
what
the
constitution
said.
so
there
is
a
different
standard
when
they
move
to
the
effects
test.
but
i
do
emphasize
texas
has
been
found
specifically
not
to
have
intentionally
discriminated
in
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
this
system.
it's
only
the
effects
test
that
matters.
and
congress
in
instituting
the
effects
test
and
going
further
than
bolden
said
the
constitution
goes,
didn't
pay
one
whit
of
serious
attention
to
judges.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
i
think
there--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
think--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
think
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
bringing
section
2(a)'s
reach
and
results.
but
it
only
reaches
results
because
of
language
inserted
in
1982.
that
language
again
didn't...
when
they
did
it,
they
didn't
attend
to
judges
at
the
state
court
level.
and
there
are
so
many
reasons
why
there
should
have
at
least
been
some
debate
on
this
if
they
were
thinking
about
judges...
the
application
of
the
one-person,
one-vote
rule
which
it
doesn't
work
in
this...
in
the...
for
state
judges.
surely
that
would
have
been
mentioned.
surely
the
other
differences
between
judges
and
others
would
have
been
at
least
mentioned
if
they
had
thought
they
were
extending
the
constitution
further
than
you
have
extended
it.
but
they
didn't
mention
it.
i'd
like
to
turn
briefly
to
what
has
been
called
the
solo
decision-maker
exception
argument
that
we
have
made
and
that
judge
higginbotham
and
four
other
members
of
the
fifth
circuit
found
to
be
persuasive.
i
first
want
to
say
that
it
is
not
an
argument
for
an
exception
from
section
2
for
trial
judges.
there
are
other
aspects
of
section
2
and
section
2(b)
than
just
vote
dilution
aspects.
i
am
only
talking
about
the
inapplicability
of
the
concept
of
at-large
vote
dilution
challenges
to
trial
judges
to
solo
decision
makers.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
trial
judges
are
solo
decision
makers.
they
function
independently.
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
blackmun
has
recently...
in
a
different
setting...
has
recently
talked
about
the
difference
between
appellate
courts
and
trial
courts
and
how
trial
court
functions
independently
and
as
a
solo
decision
maker
and
how
appellate
courts
function
in
a
collective
manner.
there
is
no
indication...
in
fact
reynolds
v.
simms
which
is
the
progenitor
of
all
this...
suggests
otherwise.
but
there's
no
indication
that
congress
when
it
enacted
section
2
intended
to
get
into
destroying
the
basic
choice
of
the...
the
electorate
to
be
represented
by
the
decision...
decision-making
body
that
they
elect.
texas
has
set
up,
for
instance,
the
legislature.
the
decisions
coming
out
of
there
in
the
form
primarily
of
legislation
it
seems
to
me.
texas...
section
2
can't
destroy
that
choice
that
the
electorate
is
the
whole
state
of
texas.
how
it
is
carved
up
is
different.
but
the
electorate
is
the
whole
state
of
texas
and
the
decision
that
their...
their
democratic
views
are
embodied
in
decisions
made
by
a
body
representing
the
whole
state
of
texas.
texas
has
chosen
for
trial
judges
to
say
the
county
is
the
electorate...
the
electorate
of
the
county
are
the
electorate
to
be
represented
through
the
decision
of
this
trial
judge.
there
is...
there
is
no
way
to
make
out
a
vote
dilution
vote
challenge
in
that
kind
of
setting
it
seems
to
me.
the
concept
is
inapplicable.
there
may
be
other
challenges
that
can
be
lodged
under
section
2.
that
wasn't
done
here.
but
there
may
be
other
challenges
that
can
be
lodged.
and...
the...
that
kind,
though,
cannot.
it
would
balkanize
the
representation.
you
would
have
a
judge
from
one
section
of
the
town
elected
by
one
segment
of
the
community--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
first
of
all--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
would
think
if
there
were
an
effort
to
do
that,
that
would
be
seen
as
intentional
discrimination.
trying
to
disenfranchise
people
is
intentional
discrimination,
and
we
have
not
done
that.
this
is
statistical...
a
statistically
based
test
that
was
applied
here.
and
through
statistics
it
was
suggested...
ignoring
the
role
which
is
the
overwhelming...
overwhelmingly
dominant
factor...
ignoring
the
role
of
partisan
politics,
using
statistics
and
throwing
out
that
most
people
vote
party
ticket
one
way
or
the
other
in
these
kinds
of
races,
the
court
statistically
said
there's
some
submergence.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
we
have
to--
mr.
renea
hicks
--first
of
all,
we
would
have
to
go
through
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
do
that.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
the
justice
department
at
the
first
level
would
analyze
what
was
going
on.
mr.
renea
hicks
you're...
you're
right.
i
think
though
that
you
can
attack
those
kinds
of
things
as
intentional
discrimination.
you've
suddenly...
it's
like
the
tension--
mr.
renea
hicks
--well,
i--
mr.
renea
hicks
--i
for
one
would
find
it
impossible
to
say
that
wasn't
discrimination.
this
is
like
the
swimming
pool
cases
that
the
court
cited
when
they
shut
down
in
the
south
it
seems
to
me.
i
would
find
it
impossible
to
say--
mr.
renea
hicks
--okay.
mr.
renea
hicks
okay.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
they
wouldn't
be
exempt
from
the
act.
mr.
renea
hicks
they
would
be
exempt
from
an
at-large
vote
dilution...
not
they.
mr.
renea
hicks
a
challenge
there
later
would
be
exempt
from
an
at-large
vote
dilution
challenge.
there
would
be
other
avenues
of
attack.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
i
don't
know
if
they
all
would
have
to
based
on
the
intent.
footnotes
10
and
12
of
thornburg
v.
gingles...
in
those
footnotes,
this
court
said
there
are
a
host
of
other
section
2
kinds
of
challenges.
in
at-large
vote
dilution
challenges
it
may
be
available.
and
i'm
not
creative
enough...
i've
gotten
into
the
mindset
of
being
a
defendant
in
this...
these
cases
now,
so
i'm
having
a
hard
time
thinking.
but
i'm
sure
the
plaintiffs
would
have
no
difficulty
figuring
out
a
section
2
vote...
a
section
2
challenge
to
that
kind
of
action
that
was
not
an
at-large
vote
dilution
challenge.
the
thornburg
v.
gingles
principles
wouldn't
mean
much.
it
would
be
other
aspects
of
the
language
of
section
2...
even
on
effects,
not
just
on
intent.
and
i
don't
think...
that's
the
problem
with
this.
we
have
a...
and
i
think
that's
part
of
the
reason
for
the
court's
concerns
on
the
inapplicability
of
the
one-person,
one-vote
rule
in
this
setting...
you
have
a
structure
set
up
to
attack
a
system
where
that
structure
just
doesn't
fit.
it
doesn't
fit
at
all.
at
least
congress
ought
to
have
to
go
back
and
figure
out
if
that's
the
structure
they
want
to
apply
or
if
they
want
another.
there
might
be
other
situations
in
which
that
structure...
something
other
than
that
structure
might
be
applied...
numbered
post
kind
of
system
or
something
like
that.
mr.
renea
hicks
thank
you.
