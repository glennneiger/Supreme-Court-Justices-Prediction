so
you're
saying
if
i
understand
you
that
any
numerical
ratio
that
fits
within
the
range
the
state
now
tolerates
is
an
appropriate
numerical
ratio
when
we're
trying
to
devise
a
remedy
for
your
purposes.

but
you're
saying
whether...
whether
they
are
or
not
is
in
part
a
question...
is
in
part
dependent
on
the
numerical
factor.
and
if
we
can
find
any
numerical
factor
within
a
ratio...
i
should
say
within
the
limit
which
the
state
now
tolerates
that
would
support
our
argument,
that
is
the
appropriate
numerical
ratio
for
that
case.

souter
and
that
would
also
be
the
appropriate
numerical
ratio
in
devising
a
remedy.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
souter
yes,
i
understand.
well,
what
other
standard
might
it--
