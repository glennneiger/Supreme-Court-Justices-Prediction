are
admonished
to
remain
silent.
the
court
remains
in
session.
do
not
talk
until
you
get
outside
of
the
courtroom.
mr.
chambers,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
chambers,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
about
the
meaning
of
section
2(a)
which
was,
as
you
point
out,
was
dwelled
on
rather
extensively
by
counsel
in
the
preceding
case.
it
said
that
that
embodies
the
results
tests
from
white
against
regester.
now,
do
you
rely
for
that
simply
on
the
use
of
the
word
results
as
a
verb
in
section
2(a).
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
no,
but
that...
that
it's
a
results
test--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--rather
than
an
intent
test.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
then
that
gingles
established
the
proposition
that
2(a)
is
phrased
in
terms
of
results
rather
than
intent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
that
the
officer
of
governor
as
you
understand
it
is
what
you
call
truly
a
single-person
office?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
your--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--so,
you're...
all...
you're
just
reserving
the
situation
for
governors
that
you
don't
know
anything...
governorships
that
you
don't
know
anything
about.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
that
because
they
have
jurisdiction
in
other
counties
or
just
because
a
lawsuit
can
be
brought
into
the
county
in
which
they
have
jurisdiction
which
has
parties
to
it
that
would
be
in
from
other
counties?
chief
justice
rehnquist
by
what?
the
chief
justice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
by
the...
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas?
chief
justice
rehnquist
with...
within
the
administrative
division?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
chambers.
mr.
hicks,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr....
mr.
hicks,
you...
take
a
look
at
the
word
2(a).
isn't
it
perfectly
possible
to
read
that
as
"causes"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
really
doesn't
speak
one
way
or
the
other
then
to
the
question
of
intent,
does
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
have--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
if
you
read
it
simply
as
causes
or
eventuates
in,
then
you're
simply
referred
to
the
phrases
beyond
that
for
the
substantive
meaning
of
this
section.
"a
denial
or
abridgement
of
the
right
of
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color
or
in
controversion
of
the
guarantees
set
forth
in
subsection
2.
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
by--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
hicks,
why
is
it
more
intrusive
to
apply
the
voting
rights
act
to
state-elected
judges
than
it
is
to
state-elected
representatives
or
supervisors?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
is--
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
these
state
court
trial
judges
are
nonetheless
the
creatures
of
the
state
and
not
of
the
national
government.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it's
one
thing
to
say
they
were
unintentionally
covered
by
congress
when
it
wasn't
thinking
about
it.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
congress
has
to
have
some
added
justification
to...
to
cover
them
than
it
would
have
to
cover
representatives
i
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--jacksonian
democracy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
jefferson
was
not
at
all
in
favor
of
electing
judges.
jackson
was.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hicks.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
chambers,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chambers.
the
case
is
submitted.
