justice
o'connor
mr.
chambers,
texas
like
many
states
i
think
that
elect
judges
has
decided
that
it
will
elect
judges
at
large
from
the
district
over
which
the
judges
have
jurisdiction.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
now,
does
the
voting
rights
act
give
the
federal
courts
the
power
to
change
that
and
require
that
judges
be
elected
from
subdistricts?
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
it's
a
single-person
office
like
that
of
governor
of
the
state.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
voting
rights
act
could
require
that
there
be
a
committee
of
governors?
justice
o'connor
so
you
think
it
could
require
an
entirely...
a
complete
restructuring
of
the
form
of
government
in
the
state?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
happens
to
be
the
case
in
all
50
states
right
now,
doesn't
it?
justice
o'connor
uh-huh.
but
you
think
that
can
be
changed
by
a
federal
court?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
chambers,
you
take
the
position
that
under
the...
the
term
"totality
of
the
circumstances"
that
it
doesn't
mean
totality...
that
you
can't
weight
the
state's
interest
as
part
of
the
totality.
justice
o'connor
it
can't
come
in
as
one
of
the
circumstances
to
be
weighed?
justice
o'connor
well,
where
does
it
say
that
can
only
be
tenuous?
i
don't
understand.
justice
o'connor
why
isn't
it
just
one
of
the
circumstances?
justice
o'connor
where
do
we
find
the
guidelines
in
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
are...
you're...
are
you
referring
to
a
particular
committee
report
or
to
a--
justice
o'connor
--uh-huh.
justice
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
o'connor
--well,
there
were
certainly
some
section
5
suits,
weren't
there?
justice
o'connor
and
wasn't
it
held
that
the
section
5
requirements
applied
at
judges?
justice
o'connor
well,
it's
a
little
strange
to
then
say
section
2
doesn't
apply
if
any
change
in
the
election
scheme
or
the
voting
scheme
has
to
be
cleared
under
section
5,
then
it's
a
little
odd--
justice
o'connor
--well,
but
under
your
test,
there
wasn't
any
specific
discussion
or
consideration
of
judges
at
that
time
either.
and
yet
we've
said
section
5
applies.
justice
o'connor
mr
chambers,
do
you
know
of
any
jurisdiction
that
today
is
using
cumulative
voting
for
the
election
of
judges?
