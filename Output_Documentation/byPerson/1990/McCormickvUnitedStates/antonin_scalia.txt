justice
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.
di
trapano.
as
i
understand
it,
the
government's
theory
for
not
using
it,
however,
is
quite
different
from
the
one
that
you
have
said.
justice
scalia
their
theory
was
that
there
had
to
be
some
coercion
or
threat
of
force.
that
was
what
they
thought.
that
it
was
not
an
independent
clause,
color
of
official
right,
that
it
just
went
with
the
other
ones.
right?
justice
scalia
no,
no,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
those
years--
justice
scalia
--in
which,
as
you
have
just
described,
the
government
never
used
this
provision--
justice
scalia
--for
things
of
this
sort,
political
corruption.
their
reason
for
not
using
it
was
not,
was
not
the
legislative
history
that
you
have
just
described.
their
reason
for
not
using
it
was
not,
as
i
understand
it,
that
they
thought
you
had...
in
order
to
come
within
it
you
had
to
assert
a
right
to
it
that
you
really
didn't
possess.
justice
scalia
well,
my
understanding
is
that
that
was
not
the
government's
reason.
that
the
government's
reason
for
not
using
it
was
that
they
thought
it
was
not
an
independent
clause
at
all,
but
that
that
whole
clause,
"or
under
color
of
official
right.
"
was
attached
to
the
other
clauses,
and
you
had
to
show
the
other
ones
in
addition
to
that
one.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
you're
referring...
i'm
sorry.
you're
referring
to
page
34
of
the
joint
appendix,
i
take
it,
in
which
the
instruction
says
in
order
to
find
mr.
mccormick
guilty
you
must
be
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
payment
alleged
was
made
with
the
expectation
that
such
payment
would
influence
mr.
mccormick's
official
conduct
and
with
knowledge
on
his
part
that
it
was
made,
that
the
payment
was
made,
with
that
expectation?
justice
scalia
and
you
say
that
that
is
quite
different
from
a
quid
pro
quo?
justice
scalia
before
you
do,
the
evidence...
one
can
concede
that
the
evidence
supports
that
conclusion
without
conceding
that
the
jury
was
required
to
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
what
in
the
instructions
requires
the
jury
to
find
that
this
was
not
a
campaign
contribution,
in
the
sense...
in
the
proper
sense
of
a
campaign
contribution?
justice
scalia
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
specifically
the
sections
of
the
instruction
that
we
were
talking
about.
if
something
is
not
a
campaign
contribution
if
it
is
given
with
the
expectation
of
deriving
some
benefit
from
it,
then
indeed
nothing
is
a...
or
very
little
is
a
campaign
contribution.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
before
you
do
that,
what
about
the
top
paragraph
on
34?
the
first
full
paragraph
on
34.
was
that
a
part
of
the
instructions
that
the
defendant
requested?
justice
scalia
well,
wait--
justice
scalia
--there
was
no
objection
to
the
instructions
at
all?
justice
scalia
well,
as
i
see
the
difference
between
34,
the
first
paragraph
on
34
says
what
extortion
does
consist
of,
and
the
paragraph
you
just
quoted
says
what
a
campaign
contribution
that
is
not
extortion
consists
of.
and
the
only
difference
between
the
two
is
that
paragraph
on
page
33
beginning
"many
public
officials".
it
says
it's
okay
if
you
give
the
money
even
in
the
hope
that
the
goodwill
generated
will
make
the
official
more
receptive.
and
then
this
paragraph
on
34
says
however,
it's
bad
and
it's
extortion
if
it's
given
not
with
the
hope
but
with
the
expectation
that
it
will
produce
his
conduct.
is
that
the
line
that
you
think
is
the
correct
one
between
hope
and
expectation?
that's
the
line
between
extortion
and
a
campaign
contribution?
justice
scalia
mr.
wright,
as
i...
may
i
call
your
attention
again
to
page
37
of
the
appendix?
you
made
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
whatever
error
was
made
in
the
campaign
contribution
section
of
the
instructions
was
harmless
because
the
jury
found
that
there
hadn't
been
a
campaign
contribution
anyway,
and
you
quoted
that
section
on
37
where
in
order
to
constitute
nontaxable
political
contributions
the
payment
must
have
been
made
for
one
or
more
of
the
following
purposes.
and
then
you
say
the
jury,
in
order
to
find
him
guilty
of
this
count,
must
have
found
that
one
of
those
two
existed.
correct?
did
i
understand
your
argument
correctly?
justice
scalia
that's
right,
but
they
would
have
been
non-taxable
not
because
they
were
not
political
contributions
originally
when
made,
but
because
they
were
not
nontaxable
political
contributions,
because
although
they
may
have
been
contributed
for
his
campaign,
he
converted
them
to
his
own
use.
that
would
make
them
taxable,
but
it
wouldn't
prove
that
the
jury
did
not
find
them
to
have
been
political
contributions
originally.
justice
scalia
but
the
issue
is
what
the
jury
understood
by
these
instructions.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
36
the
judge
says
if
you
find
that
they
were
campaign
contributions
you
must
further
be
convinced
that
the...
that
he
converted
them.
and
that's
what
the
later
instruction
goes
to:
even
if
they
were
campaign
contributions.
i
don't
see
that
this,
that
the
jury's
conviction
on
the
later
count
necessarily
shows
that
they
came
to
any
conclusion
on
campaign
contributions,
other
than
the
kind
of
conclusion
that
would
have
been
affected
by
the
campaign
contribution
instructions,
which
didn't
require
a
quid
pro
quo
to
invalidate
it.
