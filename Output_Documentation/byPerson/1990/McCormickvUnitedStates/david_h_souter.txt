justice
souter
so
you're
saying
that
the
quid
pro
quo
instruction
is
necessary
in
effect
to
distinguish
a
campaign
contribution
from
something
which
is
not?
i
mean,
that's
what
it
boils
down
to?
justice
souter
all
right.
now,
you
answered...
if
i
recall,
a
moment
ago
you
answered
one
of
justice
o'connor's
questions
by
saying
that
a
promise
merely
to
use
best
efforts
to
help
in
the
passage
of
legislation
would
not
be
a
sufficient
quid
pro
quo.
is
that
correct?
was
that
your
answer?
justice
souter
so
that
would
be
enough?
justice
souter
well,
the
quid
pro
quo,
i
suppose,
can
either
be
a
promise
to
use
best
efforts,
or
i
suppose
the
next
step
would
be
a
promise
to
deliver
the
legislation.
and
i
take
it
you're
not
going
so
far
as
to
say
that
there
has
somehow
got
to
be
a
promise
to
deliver
the
finished
product
before
a
legislator
could
provide
a
quid
pro
quo
for
purposes
of
this
statute?
justice
souter
do
you
think
it
was
finable
on
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
that's
what
your
client
was
indicating?
justice
souter
well,
does
there
have
to
be
one
word?
justice
souter
in
other
words,
it's
not
so
much
the
definiteness
now
of
the
quid
pro
quo,
as
the
definiteness
of
the
statement
expressing
the
promise
or
the
demand
for
a
quid
pro...
or
the
promise
of
a
quid
pro
quo
for
the
demand
that
you
are
requiring?
justice
souter
he's
just
got
to
be
more
explicit
about
it,
is
what
you're
saying.
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
souter
no,
i
don't,
i
don't
need...
i
don't
think
you
need
to
argue
that
to
me.
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i
am
understanding
exactly
what
you're
saying.
and
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
there
had
been
an
explicit
solicitation
by
which
your
client
said
either
i
am
going
to
use
no
more
efforts
to
help
these
doctors
if
they
don't
contribute,
or
conversely,
i
will
continue
to
use
my
best
efforts
if
they
do
contribute,
that
would
have
been
enough
to
provide
a
quid
pro
quo.
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
but
mr.
wright,
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
jury
would
be
left,
given
these
instructions,
with
the
understanding
that
the
difference
between
the...
what
is
or
is
not
a
campaign
contribution,
and
hence
what
is
or
is
not
a
payoff,
is
a
difference
which
depends
on
the
distinction
between
giving
with
hope
and
giving
with
expectation?
isn't
that
a
fair
assessment
of
the
instructions?
justice
souter
yeah,
but
every...
every
candidate
receives
money
on
account
either
of
the
office
that
he
holds
or
hopes
to
hold.
justice
souter
but...
and
maybe
i'm
just
going
around
in
circles
here,
but
i
don't
see
what
the
jury
had
to
go
on
to
determine
what
was
or
was
not
a
contribution,
except
this
distinction
between
hope
and
expectation.
justice
souter
yes,
but
he
was...
he
was
also
requesting
more.
i
mean,
it's
not
as
though,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
the
petitioner
never
said
implicitly
or
otherwise
that
the
instructions
as
they
stand
are
fine.
i
think
he
was
saying
that
the
instructions
without
the
addition
of
some
kind
of
quid
pro
quo
language
are
misleading.
isn't
that
true?
