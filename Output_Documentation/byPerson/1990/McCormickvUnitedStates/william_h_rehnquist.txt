h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-1918,
robert
l.
mccormick
v.
united
states.
mr.
di
trapano,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
exactly
was
his
district?
chief
justice
rehnquist
logan
county.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
went
unreported
because
the
petitioner
didn't
report
it,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
di
trapano,
i
think
justice
o'connor
also
asked
how
do
you
explain
the
failure
to
report
it
under
west
virginia
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
di
trapano,
let
me
take
you
back,
if
i
may,
to
the
jury
charge
that
you
were
speaking
about
and
which
questions
were
asked
on
page
34
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
language
used
in
that
first
paragraph
is
that
the
payment
had
to
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
doctors
with
the
expectation
that
such
payment
would
influence
mr.
mccormick's
official
conduct.
now,
that
is
the
charge
that
you
think
was
mistaken
in
stating
the
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
said
earlier
that
there
was
a
charge
that
it
had
to
be...
the
jury
would
have
to
find
it
was
given
in
expectation
of
benefit,
and
is
there
another
charge
to
that
effect,
or
were
you
just
paraphrasing
this
charge?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
page
of
the
joint
appendix
is
that
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
di
trapano.
mr.
wright,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
page
of
the
joint
appendix
will
you
be
dealing
with?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from
now?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wright,
how
about
the
instruction
that
petitioner
mentioned,
the
last
full
paragraph
on
page
30
of
the
joint
appendix?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wright,
you
know,
it
isn't
as
if
the
hobbs
act
had
a
legislative
exception
for
campaign
contributions.
i
mean,
the
statute
prohibits
certain
conduct,
and
you're
agreeing
that
ordinarily
a
campaign
contribution
does
not
come
within
that
prohibition.
but
to
charge
the
jury
that
the
money
must
have
been
given
on
account
of
the
defendant's
office,
certainly
that
covers
an
awful
lot
of
campaign
contributions,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you're...
you
know,
if
i'm
senator
so-and-so
and
i
go
before
some
group
that...
raising
funds,
and
they
say
well,
gee,
he
has
sure
voted
the
way
we
wanted
him
to
the
last
6
years,
let's
give
him
some.
isn't
that
giving
him
money
on
account
of
his
official...
his
office?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
talk
as
if
the
term,
quote,
"campaign
contribution"
is
somewhere
defined
in
a
statute.
it
isn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
argument
suggests
that
there
is
a
very
clearly
established
definition
of
the
term
campaign
contribution
which
he
who
runs
may
read,
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
line
between
campaign
contribution
and
something
that
violates
the
hobbs
act.
it
turns
out
to
be
a
very
fuzzy
line.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
di
trapano,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
di
trapano.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
