justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
completely
understand
your
answer.
it
seemed
to
me
the
judge
did
say
it's
not
illegal
in
and
of
itself
to
solicit
or
accept
legitimate
campaign
contributions,
and
so
forth.
justice
stevens
and
the
mere
receipt
of
such
political
contribution
is
not
illegal.
now,
they
found
he
acted
illegally,
so
did...
does
it
not
necessarily
follow
they
found
he
did
not
receive
such
a
campaign
contribution?
justice
stevens
mr.
wright,
can
i
ask
you
a
rather
basic
question?
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
the
opinion,
the
basic
argument
the
appellate
made
was
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
conviction.
i
don't
understand
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
there
was
any
argument
about
instructions
at
all.
am
i
right,
or
did
they
specifically
challenge
particular
instructions
that
were
erroneously
given
or
erroneously
failed
to
be
given?
justice
stevens
they
objected
in
the
trial
court?
justice
stevens
and
did
they
argue
that
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stevens
because
the
court
of
appeals...
reading
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
one
would
get
the
impression
that
the
case
was
argued
on
the
assumption
that
the
jury
was
properly
instructed.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
find
in
your
opponent's
brief
a
particularization
of
the
instructions
that
he
contends
were
erroneously
given
or
failed
to
be
given.
justice
stevens
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient--
justice
stevens
would
you
just
help
me
on
the
term
payoff?
by
that
i
take
it
you
mean
money
that
was
to
be
received
and
used
by
him
personally,
as
opposed
to
reimbursing
campaign
expenditures?
justice
stevens
if
he
proved
that
he
had
in
fact
used
it
for
campaign
purposes,
would
it
be
a
payoff?
justice
stevens
mr.
di
trapano,
before
you
start
may
i
just
ask
you
to
tell
us
specifically
which
instructions
you
objected
to
that...
and
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
erroneously
given,
and
you
still
pertain?
justice
stevens
you
did?
the
court
of
appeals
never
mentioned
the
issue?
justice
stevens
you
don't
identify
in
your
brief
here
which
instructions
you
thought
were
erroneously
given,
do
you?
justice
stevens
so
your
argument
is
basically
not
that
the
jury
was
improperly
instructed,
but
rather
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
insufficient
to
support
the
conviction?
