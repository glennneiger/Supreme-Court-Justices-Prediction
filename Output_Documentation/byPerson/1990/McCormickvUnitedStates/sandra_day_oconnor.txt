justice
o'connor
not
only
didn't
report
it
for
state
law
purposes
as
campaign
contribution,
but
didn't
report
it
as
federal
income.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
those
facts
are
evidence
about...
that
go
to
whether
it
was
a
campaign
contribution
or
not.
if
it
isn't
treated
by
the
candidate
in
compliance
with
the
laws
for
receiving
campaign
contributions,
i
suppose
the
jury
can
consider
that
fact.
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
explain
the
failure
to
report
it
as
a
campaign
contribution
and
the
failure
to
report
it
as
income?
justice
o'connor
explain
it.
justice
o'connor
mr.
di
trapano--
justice
o'connor
--do
you
think
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
hobbs
act
for
a
legislator
to
say
if
you
will
give
me
a
so-called...
a
campaign
contribution,
then
i
promise
i
will
try
to
help
you
get
the
legislation
you
want?
justice
o'connor
does
it
cover
that?
justice
o'connor
does
the
language
cover
it?
justice
o'connor
color
of
right.
justice
o'connor
in
exchange
for
a
promise.
justice
o'connor
some
courts
have
so
held.
justice
o'connor
and
a
promise
could
be
a
quid
pro
quo.
justice
o'connor
which
could
be
express
or
implied.
justice
o'connor
but
it
could
be
a
promise?
justice
o'connor
it
could
be
a
promise,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
that
that
understanding
could
be
implicit
rather
than
express?
isn't
that
possible?
justice
o'connor
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
promise
is
implicit,
as
justice
souter
has
described
it,
then
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
hobbs
act.
it's
a
quid
pro
quo.
justice
o'connor
your
argument
is
it
has
to
be
express.
justice
o'connor
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that.
justice
o'connor
of
what
page?
justice
o'connor
but
mr.
wright,
doesn't
every
person
who
makes
a
political
contribution
almost
expect
some
kind
of
benefit
in
some
form?
justice
o'connor
you
expect
to
be
benefitted
by
having
their
service,
or
because
of
the
positions
you
expect
them
to
take.
i
mean,
it's
a
very
difficult
line
unless
you
rely
on
a
line
that
says
there
has
to
be
a
quid
pro
quo.
and
in
that
event
we
know
what
is
a
contribution
and
what
isn't.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
wright,
if
we
thought
a
quid
pro
quo
was
an
element
of
the
offense,
then
i
suppose
the
instructions
were
deficient?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
there
has
to
be
some
promise,
express
or
implied,
of
benefit
that
the
office
holder
makes
in
exchange
for
the
payment.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
did
the
instructions
not
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
government
prove
the
defendant
promised
to
commit
a
quid
pro
quo?
justice
o'connor
well,
would
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
32
and
33
and
tell
me?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
it
goes
on
and
says
in
either
event
a
quid
pro
quo...
it
says
it...
a
quid
pro
quo
is
not
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
now,
i
guess
some
courts
think
it
is,
and
i
suppose
that's
why
we
took
this
case.
justice
o'connor
when
you
say
it
isn't
necessary
in
a
payoff
case,
isn't
that
the
paradigm
example
of
a
quid
pro
quo?
what
is
a
payoff
if
it
isn't
a
quid
pro
quo?
justice
o'connor
i
don't
understand.
justice
o'connor
is
that
not
a
quid
pro
quo?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
the
statute
doesn't
require
that?
justice
o'connor
that
there
be
a
quid
pro
quo?
justice
o'connor
it
does.
justice
o'connor
but
the
jury
was
told
that
there
is...
that's
not
an
essential
element,
that
it's
not
necessary.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
isn't
couched
in
terms
of
a
defense
at
all.
