mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case,
in
our
view,
is
whether
petitioner
received
a
personal
payoff
or
a
campaign
contribution,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held,
quote,
"the
evidence
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
money
was
never
intended
by
any
of
the
parties
to
be
a
campaign
contribution.
"
i'd
like
to
briefly
review
the
facts
to
show
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
jury
were
both
correct
in
that
finding.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
would
be
happy
to
review
the
instructions
with
you
at
this
point.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
first
let
me
say
that
the
portion
of
the
instructions
that
mr.
di
trapano
was
referring
to
don't
really
have
to
do
with
campaign
contributions.
but
i'd
like
to
take
a
minute
and
really
go
through
this,
if
you're
troubled
by
it.
i
think
that
justice
stevens
and
others
suggested
that
the
instructions
are
really
quite
clear,
that
the
jury
could
not
convict
if
they
concluded
that
this
was
a
campaign
contribution,
and
i
think
that
that
is
correct.
i'll
focus
on
the
instructions
that
were
given,
the
supplemental
instructions,
since--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--they
start
on
page
27
and
they
run
until
the
end.
i'd
like
to
first
note
that
if
you
start
on
page
29
the
court
sets
out
the
basic
elements
of
a
hobbs
act
violation,
and
on
page
29
and
30
it
talks
about
inducement.
on
page
30
through
32
it
speaks
about
the
meaning
of
color
of
official
right.
on
page
33
and
going
over
to
the
top
of
34
the
court
is
still
speaking
of
the
hobbs
act
and
it
covers
campaign
contributions.
it
returns
to
campaign
contributions
on
page
37
as
part
of
the
tax
fraud
defense.
now,
looking
at
pages
33
to
34
i'd
like
to
note
that
there
are
1,
2,
3,
4...
5
paragraphs.
each
one
of
those
paragraphs
was
delivered
verbatim
from
the
instructions
the
petitioner
requested.
of
course
there
was
no
objection.
nothing
was
deleted
from
their
requested
instructions.
excuse
me.
it
says
that
many
public
officials
in
this
country
receive
campaign
contributions--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
second
full
paragraph.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
33.
"many
public
officials
in
this
country
receive
political
contributions
from
individuals
who,
the
official
knows,
are
motivated
by
a
general
gratitude
toward
him.
"
i
won't
finish
that
paragraph.
the
next
paragraph
says,
"the
mere
solicitation
or
receipt
of
such
political
contributions
is
not
of
itself
illegal.
"
the
next
paragraph
reviews
the
facts
of
this
case
and
says
that
there
is
evidence
that
mr.
mccormick
might
have
received
campaign
contributions.
the
paragraph
after
that
says,
and
i'll
quote
it,
"it
would
not
be
illegal,
in
and
of
itself,
for
mr.
mccormick
to
solicit
or
accept
political
contributions
from
foreign
doctors
who
would
benefit
from
this
legislation.
"
i'd
like
to
turn
briefly
to
page
37.
the
tax
fraud
instruction--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no.
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
part
of
the
campaign
contribution
defense
instruction.
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--let
me
say
next
that
they
did
not
object
to
this
instruction
either.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
not
to
the
paragraph
on
page
34
that
you've
just
referred
to.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
jury
instructions
are
reasonably
read
that
way.
i
think,
reading
them
in
context,
the
court
has
explained
what
color
of
official
right
means,
and
the
instruction
you're
speaking
of
goes
more
to
that.
but
the
jury
has
also
been
instructed
at
considerable
length
that
if
it
was
a
campaign
contribution
he
can't
be
convicted.
and
i
don't
think
that
anything
in
the
color
of
official
right
instructions
can
be
read
to
negate
the
longer
express
instruction
that
petitioner
requested
on
campaign
contributions.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
think
that
it's
very
unusual
for
a
petitioner
to
be
commenting
on
this.
let
me
explain
that
it
was
the
government
who
objected
to
this
instruction.
as
originally
given,
the
government
objected
to
the
word
"voluntary"
because
in
context
it
seemed
to
suggest
that
because
the
doctors
consented
to
the
payments
that
it
would
be
a
defense,
and
hence
it
would
be
impossible
to
convict
anyone
who
consensually
made
a
payment.
the
district
court
then
came
up
with
the
phrase
"freely
given
without
expectation
of
benefit.
"
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
think
that
in
context
it
distinguishes
what
the
district
court
meant
it
to
distinguish,
and
what
i
think
the
jury
understood
it
to
be,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
consensual
payment
and
a
voluntary--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
your
honor,
i
think
whether
it's
a
contribution
or
not
can
be
determined
from
the
facts.
now,
we
agree
that
if
it
is
in
fact
a
campaign
contribution,
a
sort
of
heightened
quid
pro
quo
would
be
required.
in
our
view
vote
selling
is
what
is
covered
in
the
case
of
campaign
contributions.
if
it's
a
personal
payoff,
however,
in
our
view,
it
is
always
a
misuse
of
public
office
for
an
official
to
accept
a
payoff
for
doing
his
job.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
don't
think
so.
i
think,
again,
that
the
jury
was
instructed
what
the
meaning
of
color
of
official
right
was,
and
was
instructed
that
that
meant
that
the
official
had
to
know
that
the
public
official
was
receiving
money
on
account
of
his
office.
in
this
case
that
mr.
mccormick
was
receiving
it--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--and
it
was
told
that
it
couldn't
convict
if
it
was
a
campaign
contribution.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
your
honor,
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
tax
fraud
instructions.
let
me
add
first
that
any
ambiguity
in
the
campaign
contribution
charge
would
be
chargeable
to
petitioner,
who
again
requested
those
instructions.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
there
was
one
objection
to
the
quid
pro
quo
instruction,
yes.
none
to
the
campaign
contribution
portion
of
the
charge.
on
page
37
of
the
joint
appendix
with
respect
to
the
tax
fraud
charge
with
jury
was
told
that
in
order
to
constitute
nontaxable
political
contributions
payments
must
have
been
made
for
one
or
more
of
the
following
purposes.
(1)
utilized
for
generally
recognized
campaign
expenses,
regardless
of
when
such
expenses
were
incurred,
or
(2)
used
to
reimburse
the
political
candidate
for
out-of-pocket
campaign
expenses
paid
by
him,
et
cetera.
in
light
of
those
instructions,
and
the
jury
convicted
petitioner
on
the
tax
fraud
offense,
i
think
it's
really
very
clear
that
the
jury
could
not
have
concluded
that
these
were
in
fact
campaign
contributions.
they
just
couldn't
have
convicted
him
on
the
tax
fraud
charge
otherwise.
if
i
may
return
briefly
to
the
facts--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--your
honor,
i
don't...
the
way
i
read
the
instructions,
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
error.
i
think--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
still,
i
believe--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
i
believe
that
the
argument
that
the
instructions
on
pages
33
to
34
of
the
joint
appendix
with
respect
to
the
campaign
contribution
defense
to
the
hobbs
act
violation
are
perfectly
adequate.
so,
that
is
the
argument
i
would
make.
i
think
that
the
tax
fraud
instructions
are
perhaps
even
more
clear.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
depends
on
exactly
what
you
mean,
again,
by
quid
pro
quo.
if
you
mean
only
vote
selling
is
illegal,
the
instructions
are
deficient.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
oh,
i'm
sorry.
if
you
mean
quid
pro
quo
in
that
sense--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
don't
think
that
they
are
deficient.
i
think
the
jury
understood
that
petitioner
was
going
to
continue
to
support
them.
what's
missing
in
this
case--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--what
the...
no,
they
don't
say
that,
phrased
that
way.
what
the
instructions--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
that's
where
i
am,
your
honor.
the
instructions
first
say,
in
the
last
full
paragraph
on
page
32,
that
whether
a
public
official
accepts
a
payment
for
an
implicit
promise
of
fair
treatment,
there
is
an
inherent
threat
that
without
such
payment
the
public
official
would
exercise
his
discretion
in
an
adverse
manner.
but
it
then
goes
on
to
reject
a
defense.
in
the
next
paragraph,
it
says
it's
not
necessary
that
the
government
prove
that
the
defendant
committed
or
promised
to
commit
a
quid
pro
quo.
now,
that
means
it's
not
a
defense
for
petitioner
here
to
say
he
would
have
supported
the
doctors
anyway.
the
fact
is
he
obtained
the
money
from
the
doctors,
knowing
that
they
were
giving
it
to
secure
his
support.
now,
he
never
said
i'm
going
to
change
my
position
unless
you
give
me
the
money.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
don't
think
any
court
thinks
it
is
in
a
payoff
case.
i
know
of
no
holding
of
that
sort.
and
we
agree
that
if
this
were
a
campaign
contribution
that
what
was
missing
here
was
better
evidence
of
vote
selling.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that's
why,
your
honor,
i
think
there--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--there
are
two
different
sorts
of
quid
pro
quo's
that
we're
talking
about
here.
there
was
a
quid
pro
quo
here.
the
doctors
understood
that
their
payoffs
to
petitioner
were
to
secure
and
retain
his
support
of
the
bill.
but
we
didn't--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
the
statute
does--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--does
require
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and
the
jury
was
told--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i...
i
think
that
this...
the
jury
has
been
told
previously
on
the
color
of
official
right...
instructions,
rather...
that
the
jury
has
to
understand...
or,
i'm
sorry,
the
jury
has
to
be
convinced
that
the
money
was
given
on
account
of
the
official's
office.
that's
under
color
of
office.
what
the
jury
was
told,
on
the
quid
pro
quo
instruction
that
you're
focusing
on,
was
that
it's
not
a
defense
for
the
doctor
to
say
that...
i
mean
for
petitioner
to
say
that
he
would
have
voted
for
the
doctors
anyway,
and
it's
not
a
deficiency
in
the
government's--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i...
well,
and
it's
not
a
deficiency
in
the
government's
evidence
that
we
didn't
show
that
he
said
give
me
the
money
or
i
will
switch
position.
it's
enough
that
they
gave
him
the
money
knowing
that...
expecting
that
this
would
keep
him
from
switching
position.
if
this
were
a
campaign
contribution
we
would
think
that
we
would
need
clearer
evidence
of
vote
selling.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
it's
a
campaign
contribution
it's
not
a
misuse
of
office.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
let
me
try
to
explain
where
we
get
it.
in
classic
this
court
defined
the
similar
phrase
under
color
of
laws,
under
color
of
state
laws
by
misuse
of
state
law.
and
the
lower
courts
have
similarly
defined
under
color
of
official
office
to
mean
by
misuse
of
official
office.
it
is
a
misuse
of
official
office
to
accept
a
payoff
to
do
your
job.
it
is
always
a
misuse.
it
is
not
a
misuse
in
the
example
you
gave
for
an
elected
official
to
seek
a
campaign
contribution
from
people
whose
positions
he
has
supported.
and
that...
that's
the
real
difference.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
there
is
a
line.
i
guess
i
disagree
as
to
just
how
fuzzy
it
is.
any
money
that
is
given
to
be
used
to
defray
campaign
expenses
is,
in
our
view,
a
campaign
contribution,
whether
or
not
it
violates
a
state
election
law,
although
we
would
certainly
agree
that
whether--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that's
right.
that's
the
vote
selling
example
that
we
think
is
the
one
case
where
a
campaign
contribution
constitutes
extortion.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
jury
must
have
rejected
that
it
was
used
for
generally
recognized
campaign
expenses
or
to
reimburse
the
candidate.
if
it
found
that
he
had...
that
he
had
either
used
them
to
pay
campaign
expenses
or
to
reimburse
himself,
then
it
would
have
concluded
that
they
were
nontaxable,
and
would
not
have
convicted
him
of
tax
fraud.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
right
with
the
instruction
you
have
read,
your
honor.
now,
on
the
prior
page
there
is
an
instruction
that
says
that
conversion
would
make
a
campaign
contribution
taxable.
however,
ms.
beatty
suggested
that
there
was
simply
no
evidence
for
such
a,
an
instruction,
and
i'd
agree
that
that
was
right.
they
certainly
never
argued
that
he
accepted
a
campaign
contribution
and
then
pocketed
it.
their
argument
has
always
been...
well,
of
co
rse,
first
their
argument
was
he
didn't
take
the
money.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
all
that.
i
would
agree
that
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
instructions
here.
one
is
a
conversion
instruction
and
one
is
if
these
were
used
for
campaign
expenses
or
to
reimburse
the
candidate,
then
they
are
not
taxable
in
any
event.
there
was
no
conversion
argument
here.
there
was
a
reimbursement
argument
in
this
case.
we
think
that
the
jury
clearly
rejected
that
reimbursement
argument.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
these
were
campaign
contributions,
but
that
there
was
a
quid
pro
quo?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
don't
think
that
the
jury
could
have
found
that
in
light
of
these
instructions.
or
i
don't
think
that
they
did.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we...
that's
right,
we
did
not
present
evidence,
and
i
am
sorry,
when
i
said
quid
pro
quo
again
i
meant
the
heightened
sort
of
quid
pro
quo.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
mccormick--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
we
did
not
show
that
the
doctors
reasonably
believed
that
mr.
mccormick
was
definitely
going
to
change
position
unless
they
gave
him
this.
we
simply
argued
they
gave
him
the
money
to
secure
his
support,
but
it
wasn't
clear
vote
selling.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
they
objected
to
one
portion
of
an
argument,
of
an
instruction
respecting
the
quid
pro
quo
instructions.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
the
first
time--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
believe
that
they
mentioned
that
in
their
brief,
but--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
oh,
no,
no.
they...
the
focus
of
their
argument
has
always
been
that
this--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--is
a
campaign
contribution,
not
a
payoff.
that's
right,
and
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
payoff.
that's
certainly
how
the
case
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that's
how
it
was
argued
in
the...
in
the
district
court
once
they
gave
up
the
position
that
the
money
had
never
been
paid
at
all,
halfway
through
the
trial.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i'm
not
sure
that
we
couldn't
have
proved
a
quid
pro
quo,
but
we
didn't...
we
didn't
go
for
the
very
strict...
we
proved
that
this
money
was
given
to
secure
his
support.
we
didn't
prove
that
he
explicitly
said
i'm
going
to
change
position,
or
we
didn't
meet
that
heightened
requirement
that
we
think
might
well
be
needed
in
a
case
of
a
campaign
contribution.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
true,
your
honor.
we...
we're
very
sensitive
about
not,
not
criminalizing
ordinary
campaign
behavior,
and
we
want
to
make
quite
clear
that
we
don't
think
it's
a
misuse
of
office...
i
believe
it
was
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical...
for
a
candidate
to
stand
in
front
of
a
group
and
say
i'm
a
supporter
of
your
position
and
i'm
running
for
reelection
and
you
ought
to
contribute
to
my
campaign.
but
again,
that's
not
this
case,
where
mr.
mccormick
went
to
the
doctors'
lobbyist,
who
had
previously
picked
up
a
$766
hotel
tab
for
him,
thus
indicating
his
willingness
to
dispense
favors,
and
said
i've
paid
about
$2,000
out
of
my
own
pocket
and
i
haven't
heard
from
your
doctors.
they
deliver
$2,900
in
cash
the
next
day,
which
is
even
more
than
he
claimed
he'd
spent.
they
deliver
it
in
$100
bills,
placed
in
sealed
envelopes,
personally
delivered
to
him.
they
make
three
more
payments
later
on,
long
after
the
election,
and
petitioner
finally
says
the
debt
is
paid,
and
they
cease
to
make
payments.
now,
under
those
facts
we
think
it's
plain
that
this
was
a
payoff,
not
a
campaign
contribution,
and
that
it
was
a
misuse
of
office
for
him
to
obtain
them.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
money
given
to
him
unconditionally,
to
be
used
for
any
purpose
he
wanted.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
it
was
given
to
him
as
a
payoff
and
he
happened
to
pay
them
off...
to
use
it
towards
a
campaign
contribution,
yes,
it
would
still
be
a
payoff.
i
think
that
might
get
him
off
the
tax
fraud
charge.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
but
of
course,
the
jury
found
that
this
was
a
payoff,
and
also
convicted
him
of
tax
fraud
in
this
case.
so
it
clearly
rejected
his
argument,
as
did
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
think
it's
decision
is
reasonable.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
more.
