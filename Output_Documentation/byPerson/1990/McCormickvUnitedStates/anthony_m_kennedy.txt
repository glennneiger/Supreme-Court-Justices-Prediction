justice
kennedy
so
is
this
a
harmless
error
analysis?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
there
had
been
no
conviction,
an
acquittal
on
the
tax
charge?
justice
kennedy
then
you
couldn't
make
the
argument
you
just
made.
justice
kennedy
--i'm
not
sure
it
follows
that
because
the
legislator
said
he
wouldn't
change
his
position
that
there
is
still
not,
that
you
still
can't
prove
some
quid
pro
quo.
justice
kennedy
but
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
a
quid
pro
quo
is
very
constrictive
of
this
statute,
as
exemplified
by
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
that
oh,
well,
a
payoff
is
not
a
quid
pro
quo...
which
is
something
i
still
can't
understand.
and
here
it
seems
to
me
that
there
can
very
well
be
a
quid
pro
quo
if
he
simply
says
he's
going
to
maintain
his
position
with
vigor,
and
that
that
is
quite
a
plausible
requirement
to
put
into
this
statute.
