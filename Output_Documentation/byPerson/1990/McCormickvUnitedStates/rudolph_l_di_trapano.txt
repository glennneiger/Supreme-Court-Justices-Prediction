mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
essential
issue
on
this
appeal
is
under
what
circumstances
and
to
what
extent
can
a
noncoercive
solicitation
of
campaign
contributions
to
defray
an
election
expense
be
in
violation
of
the
color
of
official
right
provision
of
the
hobbs
act,
and
also
to
what
extent
and
under
what
circumstances
would
income
declared
or
the
failure
to
declare
a
campaign
contribution
as
income
violate
the
tax
fraud
statutes.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
a
legislator
in
the
house
of
delegates
in
west
virginia
with
a
history
of
having
sponsored
and
having
worked
very
hard
for
a
hospital
in
southern
west
virginia
that
had
to
be
staffed
by
foreign-trained
doctors,
in
this
case
filipino
doctors.
for
a
period
of
years
the
activities
of
this
legislator
was
limited
to
extending
a
temporary
license.
without
that
extension,
without
legislative
enactment,
this
hospital
would
not
be
able
to
have
operated,
and
those
people
in
need
of
health
care
in
that
region
of
appalachia
would
have
had
to
travel
some
2-1/2
hours
to
charleston.
this
was
a
very
crucial
need
in
that
area,
and
this...
and
the
petitioner
involved
was
heavily
involved
with
that
objective.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
the
district
is
the...
it's
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia;
logan
county
is
the
county
that
he
is
elected
from,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
a
couple
of
days
before
the
june
1
payment,
the
contribution
was
made,
there
was
a
phone
call...
and
this
is
the
only
evidence,
the
only
evidence
that
links
the
petitioner
with
a
solicitation.
a
phone
call
made
by
the
lobbyist
where
the
conversation
had
to
do
with
the
campaign.
the
petitioner
said
i
have
an
expensive
campaign,
i
haven't
heard
from
the
doctors,
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it.
the
lobbyist
who
made
the
phone
call
and
the
government's
chief
witness,
vandergrift,
goes
to
see
the
head
of
the
foreign-trained
doctors
organization,
a
dr.
manuel,
and
repeated
the
conversation,
and
said
we
ought
to
help
the
petitioner
in
his
campaign,
mr.
mccormick
in
his
campaign.
the...
dr.
manuel...
they
go
to
the
bank,
and
although
the
petitioner
did
not
ask
for
cash,
and
under
west
virginia
law
cash
contributions
over
$50
is
in
violation
of
the
law,
punishable
by
three
times
the
fine,
but
not
an
incarcerative
offense.
they
go
to
the
bank,
writes
a
check
for
$2,000.
part
of
it
goes
to
the
lobbyist
for
expenses,
and
$900,
in
$100
bills,
is
put
in
an
envelope
and
delivered
to
the
petitioner.
now,
the
court...
rather
the
united
states
attorney's
office
indicted...
had
mr.
mccormick
indicted
under
color
of
official
right.
it
is
the...
it
is
our
thesis
that
color
of
official
right,
a
plain
reading,
the
plain
meaning
of
color
of
official
right
is
a
pretended
assertion
of
right,
that
the
congress
of
1946
never
contemplated
that
color
of
official
right
would
be
used
to
prosecute
election
laws
and
enforce
election
laws
of
the
state.
color
of
official
right
and
the
debate
in
congress
in
1943...
the
law
was
enacted
in
1946
but
congressman
hobbs
from
alabama,
when
questioned
about
color
of
official
right
and
what
it
meant,
the
debate
is
very
limited,
and
he
said
it
means
a
pretense
assertion
of
right.
a
public
official
who
doesn't
have
the
right
who
is
asserting
the
right,
more
rights
than
he
does
have,
in
extracting
money.
now,
for
25
years
the
justice
department
has
never
prosecuted
for
campaign
violations
until
the
1970's.
that
particular
passage
went
unobserved
and
was
not
used
as
a
vehicle
to
prosecute
defendants
for
violating
state
election
laws.
in
the
government's
brief
the
government--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--yes,
your
honor.
the
government--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--no,
your
honor.
the
government's
theory
in
the
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
they
contended
that
this
payment
was
not
a
political
contribution
at
all.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
in
those
years,
yes.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
never
used
it,
right.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
that's...
that
appears
to
be
the
government's
reasoning,
but
it's
not...
it's
not
justified
by
the,
by
the
language
of
the
act.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
that's
correct.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
that
was
used...
for
the
first
time
in
the
1970's
used,
and
disjunctive
in
the
kenny
case.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
the
government
chose
to
call
this
transaction
a
personal
payoff.
now,
the
contribution
was
admittedly
made
in
contravention
to
state
law,
because
the
state
law
in
west
virginia
makes
cash
contributions
in
excess
of
$50
illegal,
and
it
is
punishable,
as
i
have
said,
by
three
times
the
fine.
it
also
went
unreported.
now,
we
feel
that
the...
that
the
color--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
the
petitioner
didn't
report
it.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
yes.
but
the
petitioner...
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner
had
not
used
this
to
reimburse
himself
for
advance
that
he
had
made
to
his
campaign.
and
the
evidence,
and
the
government
concedes
that
that
was
the
campaign--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--well,
the
jury
apparently
did
consider
that,
but
we,
we
strongly
urged
the
court
not
to
instruct
the
jury
because
under
the
color
of
official
right
and
under
the
hobbs
act
the
means...
the
definition
of
a
political
contribution,
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
influence
the
nomination,
the
election,
or
defeat
of
a
candidate.
the
form
of
the
contribution
has
never
been
used
either
in
state
or
federal
definition
as
part
of
the
definition.
this
was
in
fact
a
campaign
contribution.
every
conversation
that
had
to
do
with
the
transaction,
it
was
described
as
helping
bob
in
the
election,
helping
him
in
his
campaign.
there
was
nothing
in
any
of
the
conversations
that
had
to
do
that
this
was
some
kind
of
a
personal
payoff.
now,
the,
the
petitioner...
the
court
in
its--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--how
do
i--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--well,
the
campaign...
money
received
to
defray
expenses
is
not
income.
and
if
it's
not
income,
it
shouldn't
be
reported.
the
tax
regulations
recognize
that,
that
you
can
have
fund
raisers
to
pay
you
back,
you
can
advance
money
to
a
campaign
and
you
can
have
fund
raisers,
and
that
is
not
income.
and
there
was
no
obligation
for
him
to
report
this
as
income.
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
application
of
the
hobbs
act,
the
color
of
official
right--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--i
don't...
i
don't
have
an
explanation
why
he
didn't
report
it,
other
than
he
simply
didn't
comply
with
the
west
virginia
reporting
laws.
there
may
be...
there
may
have
been
other
contributions
not
reported.
but
our
strenuous
objection
to
the
charge
of
the,
of
the,
to
the
jury...
the
court
in
charge
of
the
jury
in
connection
with
these
contributions
said
that
it
was...
that
if
the
contribution,
and
specifically
the
contribution
from
the
doctors
to
the
petitioner,
if
it
was
not
voluntarily
made.
and
voluntary
was
described
as
not
having
an
expectation
of
benefit,
whatever
benediction
the
defendant
received
as
a
result
of
that
instruction
was
stripped
away
by
the
court's
conditioning
every
voluntary
contribution
unless
it
was
made...
it
was
not
voluntary
if
there
was
some
expectation
of
benefit.
in
this
case,
obviously,
the
doctors
did
have
an
expectation
of
benefit,
as
virtually
every
political
contribution
carries.
in
the
instructions
that
the
court
gave
the
jury
after
our...
we
strenuously
objected
to
these
instructions.
but
the
jury
in
this
case
really
had
no
options,
because
the,
the
court
had
labeled
this...
the
court
said
that
if,
that
a
political
contribution,
even
if
not
reported
and
even
if
it
was
in
cash,
in
violation
of
state
law,
can
still
be
a
political
contribution
if
voluntarily
made.
but
then
again
destroyed
the
effect
of
that
by
saying
that
it's
not
a
voluntary
contribution
if
there
is
some
expectation
of
benefit.
going
back
to
the
hobbs
act
and
the
enmons
case,
a
request
for
contribution
is
a
first
amendment
prerogative.
political
contributions
are
necessary,
and
the
donors,
the
contributors,
as
well
as
the
candidate,
has
the
right
to
ask
for
contributions.
the
court
in
its...
the
color
of
official
right
provision
as
interpreted,
and
the
hobbs
act
as
interpreted
of
this
court,
if
the...
if
it
had...
if
there
is
a
legitimate
entitlement
to
the
contribution...
there
was
in
this
case...
then
the
means,
whether
it
was
not
reported,
whether
it
was
in
contradiction
of
state
law,
is
not
a
dispositive
factor
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
guilt
in
the
hobbs
act.
in
the
enmons
case,
as
the
court
will
remember,
there
there
was
a
strike,
a
collective
bargaining.
the
end,
the
legitimate
end,
was
a
collective
bargaining
benefit
of
higher
wages.
the
means
used
were
violating
state
laws
by
violence,
by
using
rifles,
by
blowing
up
substations,
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
not
a
violation...
the
means
used,
and
the
use
of
the
word
"wrongful"
as
when
it
precedes
"wrongful
use"--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
if
the
color
of
official
right
could
be
expanded
to
reach
into
campaign
contributions,
i'd
say
yes.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
i
don't
think
the
intent
covers
that,
but
i
do--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
color
of
official
right
has
a
specific
meaning.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
color
of
official
right
has
a...
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
covers
it.
i
don't
think--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--some
courts
have
held
that
there
has
to
be
a
quid
pro
quo
in
order
to
convict--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--a
promise,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--i
think
there
has
to
be
an
identifiable
quid
pro
quo.
there
should
be
a
more
precise
standard
in
this
situation,
because
it
is--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--there
should
be...
there
should
be
a
promise
made
on
behalf--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--yes,
your
honor.
it
should
contemplate
a
promise,
it
should
contemplate
a
consideration
and
a
promise.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question,
the
court
did
instruct
the
jury
in
that
connection.
however,
it...
the
court
kept
repeating
that
the
voluntary
contribution
had
to
be
made
without
some
expectation
of
benefit.
and
that
is
wrong
for
two
reasons.
number
one
is
that
every
contribution
has
some
expectation
of
benefit,
and
that
was
the
definition
that
was
spontaneously
suggested
to
the
court
by
the
united
states
attorney.
there
is
no
basis
for
that
as
defining
a
voluntary
contribution.
so
it
took
it
outside
the
ambit
of
a
political
contribution
once
the
court
said
unless
it
was
voluntarily
made,
and
voluntary
means
that
the
donor
cannot
have
an
expectation
of
benefit.
and,
your
honor,
that
destroyed
any...
that
took
it
outside
the
purview
of
a
campaign
contribution.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
he
did.
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
no.
if
the
court
had...
if
the
court
had
defined...
if
the
court
had
not
conditioned
to
define
the
voluntary,
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
you.
but
when
the
court
said
you
must
also
find
that
it
is
voluntarily
made,
and
when
i
say
voluntary
i
mean
that
the
donor
had
no
expectation
of
benefit.
again,
that,
your
honor,
is
in
conflict
with
the
enmons
case,
or
rather
with
the
807
case,
i
mean,
where
the
state
of
mind
of
the
donor,
the
payer,
should
not
be
the
guiding
principle
in
determining
the
legal
liability
of
the
recipient.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
yes,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
i
would
say
that
if
the
candidate,
before
he
received
a
contribution,
and
had
no
history
one
way
or
the
other,
would
say
to
a
contributor,
to
a
contributor,
that
if
i
get
a
contribution
i'll
do
my
best,
i
think
that
approaches
a
quid
pro
quo.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
i
think
it
approaches
it,
your
honor.
i,
i
still
think
it
should
be,
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
first
amendment,
when
you
are
dealing
with
campaign
contributions
and
with
the
buckley-valeo,
the...
where
it
says
that
it
will
be
rigorously...
the
standards
will
be
rigorously
reviewed,
i
believe
that
there
should
be
more,
or
it
should
be
an
identifiable
quid
pro
quo
in
the...
in
the
election
law.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
if
the
candidate
said
to
the
contributor,
i
will
not
use
my
best
efforts
if
i
don't
get
your
money,
i
will
use
my
best
efforts
if
i
do,
that's
a
quid
pro
quo.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
there
is
not
one
word
to
suggest
that.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
yes,
there
does
have
to
be
one.
there
has
to
be--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--your
honor--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--i'm
saying
he
had
to
be...
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
you
have
to
be...
you
know,
you
could
cite
100
examples.
the
nra
doesn't
contribute
to
people
who
don't
have
a
history
of
voting
against
gun
laws,
against
gun
regulations.
labor,
labor
pac
committees
would
never
contribute
to
somebody
who
votes
against
minimum
wage.
i
mean,
it's,
it's--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
think
so.
and
in
the--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--your
honor,
i
do
think
that
is
possible.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
your
honor,
i
think
that
it's
possible
for
somebody
serving
in
the
legislature,
state
or
in
congress
to...
and
implicit
in
a
campaign
contribution
is
that
he's
got
to
continue
on
a
course
of
conduct.
i
do
think
it's
implicit.
i
think
that's
the
nature
in
this
country
of
campaign
contributions
given
to
candidates
who
have
empathy
with--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
think
it
has
to
be...
there
has
to
be
identifiable
quid
pro
quo.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
they
have
any
business
in
large
to
cover
campaign
contributions,
and
congress
never
intended
this
act
to
get
involved
in
regulating
state
elections.
there
is
nothing
in
this
debate
that
suggests...
suggests
that
color
of
official
right
has
anything
to
do
with
regulating
state
elections.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
i'd
say
that's...
that
could
be
subject...
the
color...
under
color
of
official
right.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
that's
a
payoff.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
well,
the
legislator
did
then
report
it.
the
legislator'll
never--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
it's
not,
because
the
only
conversation
in
evidence
is
that--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
under
the
hobbs
act,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
yes.
there's
additional
reason
in
the
hobbs
act,
your
honor,
because
in
the
hobbs
act
the
means,
the
means
of
attaining
a
contribution
has
been
condemned
in
the
enmons
opinion.
that's
not
a
relevant
consideration.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
i'd...
i...
i
misspoke
if
i
said
that.
i'm
not
suggesting...
if
it's
a
quid
pro
quo
reason,
it
violates
the
law.
if
the
court
is
expanding--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--he
has
none.
to
defray
expenses,
that's
what
this
was
taken
for,
to
defray
expenses
that
he
had
advanced.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
i
think
that
charge
is
mistaken,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
no,
your
honor.
the
court...
let
me
read
this.
the
court
actually
said...
the
court
said,
and
the
court
recognized
our
defense
that
the
fact
that
the
contribution
was
made
in
violation
of
state
law
could
still
be
a
political
contribution
made
in
cash.
but
the
court
said
that
a
voluntary
political
contribution,
though
it
may
have
been
made
in
violation
of
local
law,
it
was
a
defense
in
this
case,
it
was
permissible.
however,
the
court
went
on
to
say
voluntary
is
that
which
is
freely
given
without
expectation
of
benefit.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
that's
on
30,
page
30.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
and
page...
and
again
the
court
repeated
on
page
31,
when
it
reread.
the
jury
was
confused,
came
back,
and
the
court
said
again,
the
mere
voluntary
payment
of
money,
without
expectation
of
benefit,
does
not
constitute
extortion.
it
had
to
be
without
expectation
of
benefit,
and
there
is
no
way
we
could
argue
that
these
four
or
five
doctors
didn't
have
some
expectation
of
benefit,
because
they
wanted
their
license.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
yes,
your
honor.
i
read
the
solicitor
general
as
mischaracterizing
the
transaction
as
being
a
personal
payoff
without
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
several
minutes
i
have.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
make--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--we
devoted
a
third
of
our
brief
to
the
instructions
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
never
mentioned
it.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
no.
it
didn't
address
it
at
all.
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
well,
what
we
didn't...
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rule
on
it
and
we
don't
address
it
in
our...
in
this
brief,
except
we
do--
mr.
rudolph
l.
di
trapano
--no,
we
objected
to
the...
we
vigorously
objected
to
the
court
defining
or
instructing
the
jury
with
respect
to
what
a
voluntary
payment,
that
it...
the
expectation
of
benefit
took
it
outside
the
ambit
of
a
campaign
contribution.
we
debated
that,
vigorously
objected
to
it.
we
fought
over...
see,
our
trial
judge
did
not
let
us
read
the
charge
he
was
going
to
give
the
jury.
we
have
to...
after
the
charge,
he
says
what
he's
going
to
do...
for
example,
we
didn't...
specific
intent
was
just...
was
charged
to
the
jury
without
our
having
any
prior
knowledge
of
what
the
instruction
was
going
to
be.
but
we
did
object
to
the
instruction.
we
offered
instructions
that
made
quid
pro
quo
an
essential...
and
quid
pro
quo
has
to
be
conditional.
and
that
was
our...
that
was
our
argument.
we
did
object
to
it,
your
honor,
and
we
objected
vigorous
to
it,
and
devoted
a
third
of
our
brief.
not
mention
it,
as
the
assistant
solicitor
says.
we
devoted
a
substantial
portion
of
our
brief
arguing
over
the
instructions
that
were
given
to
the
jury.
we
objected
vigorously
to
them,
to
the
instruction.
the
one
instruction
was
where
the
court
said
every
payment...
any
payment
made,
in
focusing
on
the
official
office
is
illegal
and
comes
within
the
purview
of
the
color
of
official
right
provision.
but
moreover,
see,
the
government
charged...
the
government
argued
to
the
jury,
he
says
we
don't
have
to
show
that
he
gave
some
quid
pro
quo
or
threatened
any
action.
simply
that
when
it
was
paid
the
doctors
paid
it
with
an
expectation
of
benefit.
that's
what
they
argued
here.
whether
it's
a
campaign
contribution
makes
no
difference,
either
if
it
was
extorted
or
under
color
of
official
right.
that's
what
the
government
argued
in
their
instructions,
that's
what
they
argued
to
the
jury,
and
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
by
those
instructions.
the
court,
moreover,
as
justice
scalia
was
questioning
about
the
tax
fraud
case,
again
voluntary
was...
on
four
occasions
that
definition
was
given
to
the
jury
that
voluntary
is
that
which
is
given
without
expectation
of
benefit.
and
if
they
found
that
it
was
a
contribution
with
that
definition,
then
he
was...
then
he
was
guilty
of
the
tax
fraud
case.
the
jury
was,
in
our
opinion,
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
to
the
fourth
circuit,
was
badly
instructed
with
respect
to
those
matters
i
have
just
mentioned.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
