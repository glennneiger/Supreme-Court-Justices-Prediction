unknown
speaker
um-hum.
but
it
should...
it
should
be
something
very
specific,
because
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
a
nonelective
public
official,
who
has
no
business
getting
money
in
the
first
instance.
there
is
no,
there
is
no
conceivable
reason
why
a
nonelective
official
should
be
asking
for
money.
and
you
can
understand
the
decisions
in
that
context.
but
where
you
have
a
candidate
for
public
office
whose
very...
whose
very
life
depends
upon
raising
campaign
contributions,
then
the
laws,
the
standards
should
be
different.
we
were
prejudiced
by
the
instructions.
the
trial
court
said
if
the
payment
focused
on
the
office.
now,
that
has
no
business
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
because
every
contribution
focuses
on
the
office.
and
the
jury
was
instructed--
--may
i
just
ask
you
this
question?
is
it
essential
to
your
position
that
we
conclude
that
this
was
a
campaign
contribution?
the
reason
i
ask
the
question
is,
as
i
read
the
instructions,
the
judge
told
the
jury
that
there
was
nothing
illegal
about
making
a
campaign
contribution.
and
do
we
not
have
to
conclude
from
the
verdict
of
guilty
that
the
jury
therefore
determined
that
it
was
not
a
campaign
contribution?
