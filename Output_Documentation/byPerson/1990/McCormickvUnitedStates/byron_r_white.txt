justice
white
counsel,
suppose
a
congressman
says
to
some
people,
i'm
not
running
for
the
next...
i'm
not
running
for
office
next
time.
i
know
you
want
this
bill
passed.
i
will
use
my
best
efforts
to
get
the
bill
passed
if
you
pay
me
$10,000.
and
there
is...
it
doesn't
even,
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
a
campaign
contribution.
now,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
that
is
subject
to
the
hobbs
act.
justice
white
that's
just
a
payoff.
justice
white
well,
suppose
that
that
same
congressman's...
suppose
the
facts
are
what
they
exactly
are
in
this
case,
and
it
did
not
purport
to
be
a
campaign
contribution.
there
was
no...
there's
no
express
anything.
the
facts
are
these
facts
except
the
legislator
doesn't
even
claim
that
it's
a
campaign
contribution.
justice
white
all
right,
but
doesn't
it...
this
pay...
suppose
in
this
case
the
payoff
never
purported
to
be,
and
was
never
claimed
to
be
a
campaign
contribution,
but
there
still
was
no
express
quid
pro
quo
agreement?
the
facts
are
just
like
they
are
in
this
case,
except
that
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
a
campaign
contribution.
justice
white
well,
but
i...
my
question
is
on
those
facts
would
the
legislator
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
hobbs
act?
justice
white
even
though
there
is
no
claim
that
it's
even
a...
campaign
contribution?
justice
white
well,
if
it
isn't,
it's
either
a
campaign
contribution
or
it's
a
payoff.
i
had
thought
you
said
the
only
way
you
could
win
in
this
case
is
if
it's
a
campaign
contribution?
justice
white
what
business
has
a
legislator
got
taking
this
kind
of
money
except
as
a
campaign
contribution?
justice
white
counsel,
do
you
read
the
solicitor
general
as
agreeing
with
you
that
if
you
are
going
to
rely
on
a
quid
pro
quo
it
has
to
be
an
explicit
agreement?
justice
white
and
shouldn't...
and
i
take
it
you
read
the
solicitor
general
as
not
resting
on
the
notion
that
there
was
a
quid
pro
quo
for
a
campaign
contribution?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
unless
there's
an
explicit
promise
to
exchange
legislative
efforts
for
the
money.
justice
white
well,
mr.
wright,
suppose
we...
suppose
we
think
the
jury
might
have
found
that
these
were
campaign
contributions,
but
that
there
was
a
quid
pro
quo,
based
on
these
facts?
i
take
it
you
would
say
to...
that
the
jury
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
white
based
on
these
facts.
justice
white
i
thought
you
a
while
ago
said
that
if
it's
a
campaign
contribution
there
has
to
be
an
explicit
statement
of
the
exchange,
and
i
thought
you
meant
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there
wasn't
such
an
explicit--
justice
white
--all
right,
but
there
was
not
evidence--
justice
white
--in
the
campaign
contribution
there
was
not
evidence
to
justify
a
conviction
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
of
these
cases
is
89-1918,
mccormick
against
the
united
states.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
had
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
justices
blackmun
and
o'connor
have
joined
that
dissent.
