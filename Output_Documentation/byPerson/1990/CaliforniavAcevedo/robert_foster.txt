mr.
robert
foster
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
the
state
of
california's
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
california
court
of
appeals,
fourth
appellate
district,
division
3.
california
contends
that
the
lower
appellate
court
erred
when
it
ordered
the
illegal
drugs
found
in
the
trunk
of
mr.
acevedo's
car
suppressed,
because
the
officers
had
too
much
probable
cause.
that
is,
they
had
particularized
probable
cause
as
to
the
paper
bag
containing
the
drugs,
rather
than
unparticularized
probable
cause
to
the
entire
vehicle.
the
state
contends
that
when
mr.
acevedo
voluntarily
and
intentionally
placed
the
bag
into
the
trunk
of
the
car,
it
attained
the
same
degree
of
mobility
as
the
car,
and
by
being
in
the
car,
it
was
subject
to
the
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
that
surrounds
a
vehicle
and
its
contents.
what
i'd
like
to
do
this
morning
is
briefly
go
through
the
facts
with
you,
and
then
explain
why
we
believe
this
court's
decisions
in
carroll,
ross,
and
carney
should
be
held
to
control
in
this
case.
we
believe
this
court
should
rule
that
the
decisions
in
chadwick
and
sanders
have
been
limited
by
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court.
the
facts
are
not
in
any
dispute
in
this
case.
back
in
1987
federal
drug
agents
in
hawaii
intercepted
a
shipment
of
drugs
bound
for
the
mainland,
nine
bags...
nine
kilo
bags
of
marijuana.
they
contacted
the
santa
ana
police
department,
allowed
the
drugs
to
proceed
to
the
federal
express
office,
and
the
local
police
officers
arranged
a
controlled
delivery.
they
followed
the
drugs
back
to
mr.
daza's
apartment.
after
a
few
minutes
mr.
daza
came
out
and
threw
away
the
outer
wrapping
material
and
the
inner
wrapping
material,
so
it
was
clear
to
the
officers
that
he
was
manipulating
the
contents,
the
drugs.
and
at
that
point
they
did
what
we
want
officers
to
do
under
those
circumstances,
they
went
to
get
a
search
warrant.
while
the
officer
was
gone...
one
of
the
officers
was
gone
getting
the
search
warrant,
co-defendant
st.
gregory
exited,
i'm
sorry,
st.
george
exited
with
a
knapsack.
the
officer
stopped
him
and
discovered
a
pound
and
half
of
marijuana
in
his
knapsack.
shortly
thereafter
mr.
acevedo
arrived,
carrying
nothing.
he
entered
the
apartment.
about
10
minutes
later
he
came
out
carrying
a
bag,
a
paper
bag.
the
bag
appeared
to
be...
the
bag
appeared
to
be
full.
he
got
in...
he
walked
to
his
vehicle,
placed
it
in
the
trunk
of
his
vehicle,
and
drove
off.
the
officers
had
a...
had
a
marked
car
stop
him
nearby.
the
trunk
was
opened,
the
bag
was
opened,
and
they
found
approximately
a
pound,
i'm
sorry,
a
half
a
pound
of
marijuana.
shortly
thereafter
the
search
warrant
for
the
apartment
arrived.
mr.
robert
foster
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe--
mr.
robert
foster
--yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
either
as
a...
as
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest...
and
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
i
think
there's
another
way
that
it
could
have
been
searched,
which
is
once
he
placed
it
into
the
vehicle,
voluntarily
and
intentionally
taking
advantage
of
the
mobility
of
the
car,
when
he
takes
advantage
of
that
aspect
of
the
vehicle
he
has
to
take
at
the
same
time
the
limitations
that
come
with
it.
the
limitations
that
come
with
it,
this
court
has
clearly
marked
in
ross,
carroll,
and
carney,
which
is
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy,
because
of
the
mobility
of
the
vehicle.
so
at
that
point
the
officers
would
probably--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
don't
think
you
expect
the
world
to
be
looking
in,
but
i
think
as
this
court
held
in
ross,
your
honor,
that
whatever
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
you
have
does
not
survive
when
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
there
are
drugs
in
the
vehicle.
i
am
sure
when
mr.
ross
in
that
case
placed
the
bag
of
drugs
and
the
pouch
of
money
into
the
trunk
he
had
the
same
subjective
expectation
as
mr.
acevedo.
in
that
sense
the
cases
are
very
parallel,
because
both
mr.
ross
and
mr.
acevedo
placed
bags
of
drugs
into
the
trunk
of
their
vehicles.
and
in
ross
this
court
held
that
that
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
was
not
objectively
reasonable.
it
did
not
survive
in
the
face
of
probable
cause.
i
think
the
point
is
that
he...
that
it
was
a
voluntary
and
intentional
act
in
his
part
in
putting
the
bag
into
the
vehicle.
and
because
of
that
he
was
seeking
to
exploit
the
mobility
of
the
vehicle.
mr.
robert
foster
no,
your
honor,
but
the
difference--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
want
you
to
extremely
limit
arkansas
v.
sanders,
yes,
your
honor.
i
understand
that
there's
an
institutional
bias
to
saying
the
word
overrule.
and
i
think
arkansas
v.
sanders
would
have
validity
as
to
luggage
outside
of
the
vehicle,
but
the
main
point--
mr.
robert
foster
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
foster
no,
i
thought
i
was
supporting
the
chief
justice's
analysis--
mr.
robert
foster
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
yes,
i
am
challenging--
mr.
robert
foster
--yes,
your
honor.
and
if
you
notice
in
justice
burger's
opinion
there,
he
keeps
talking
about
the
relationship
between
the
bag
and
the
vehicle
as
being
merely
coincidental.
and
i
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
analysis,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
chief
justice,
because
it
perceives
the
relationship
as
a
fortuity,
and
it
was
not
a
fortuity.
it
was
an
intentional,
voluntary
act.
he
sought
to
exploit
the
mobility
of
the
vehicle,
both
in
chadwick
and
in
sanders.
and
i
think
when
you
take
the
vehicle,
when
you
reach
out
to
use
that
aspect
of
it,
you
take
what
comes
with
that
mobility.
and
that,
after
ross
and
after--
mr.
robert
foster
--because
since
chadwick
and
sanders
this
court
has
decided
johns,
michigan
v.
thomas,
and
florida
v.
meyers,
and
you
have
said
you
don't
judge
mobility
later
on.
you
judge
mobility
at
the
moment
of
seizure.
justice
burger's
analysis
was
you
judge...
once
you
had
seized
the
item,
the
mobility,
the
necessity,
the
mobility
did
not
have
any
more
effect.
and
this
court
has
said
no,
you
judge
it
at
the
moment
of
seizure
but
you
can
do
the
search
later
on.
and
i
think
what
has
happened
is
this
court's
evolving
approach
to
automobile
searches
has
taken
away
the
underpinnings
of
that.
mr.
robert
foster
no,
but
i
didn't
think
you
needed
to
reach
that
issue
to
decide
ross,
your
honor.
and
indeed
the
footnote
in
place--
mr.
robert
foster
--to
resolve
it
in
ross,
no,
you
did
not,
your
honor.
this
case
squarely
presents
the
issue.
and
i
think
that
if...
you
know,
that
mr.
ross
and
mr.--
mr.
robert
foster
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
and
i
am
asking
you
to
go
back
and
reexamine
those
cases
in
light
of
ross
and
carney
and
your
more
recent
pronouncements
in
the
area.
and
i
think
that
the...
as
we
spoke
in
that
discussion,
the
underpinnings
of
chadwick
and
sanders
have
been
eaten
away
by
this
court's
subsequent
decisions.
as
we
talked
about
in
answering
your
question,
chadwick
and
sanders
look
at
the
search
of
the
bag,
or
the
search
of
the
closed
container
at
the
point
of
the
actual
search,
whereas
this
court
made
it
clear
in
ross
that
you
look
at
it,
the
mobility,
at
the
moment
of
seizure.
because
if
you
look
at
it
the
other
way
the
ross
holding
would
not
stand,
your
honor,
because
as
you
well
recall,
they
searched
the
bag
in
the
field,
found
it,
took
it
to
the
police
station
and
then
opened
it
again
without
a
warrant.
so
that
if
the
approach
in
chadwick
was
correct,
ross
and
chadwick
are
in
conflict,
because
ross
made
it
clear
that
you
look
to
the
mobility
at
the
moment
of
seizure.
additionally,
chadwick
assumed
that
whatever
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
existed
in
that
closed
container,
that
it
continued
ad
in...
forever.
however,
i
think
this
court
has
made
clear
in
ross
that
that--
mr.
robert
foster
--until
you
got
a
warrant.
yes,
your
honor.
which
can
be
forever
in
some
outlying
jurisdictions.
[laughter]
but
chadwick
assumed
that
that
expectation
continued,
and
in
ross
i
thought
this
court
made
it
clear
that
whatever
that
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
was,
it
did
not
survive
in
the
face
of
probable
cause
by
the
officers
to
believe
there
was
contraband
in
the
vehicle.
in
this
case
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
there
was
contraband
in
the
bag.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a
very
special
area,
that
is,
given
the
mobility
of
the
automobile
and
its
ability
to
rapidly
move
out
of
the
jurisdiction.
i
don't
see
that
that...
that
the
logic
of
our
position
would
be
expandable
any
further
than
a
movable
vehicle:
a
boat,
a
plane,
an
automobile.
but
to
take
it
any
further
than
that--
mr.
robert
foster
--no,
no.
we
do
not
seek
that
at
all,
and
i
don't
think
the
logic
of
a
decision--
mr.
robert
foster
--well,
certainly
you
to
an
extent
have
already
done
that
with
schimmel,
your
honor.
in
the
search
incident
to
arrest
you
can
open
any
closed
container--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
think
a
number
of
things
are
left,
your
honor.
for
example,
in
the
chadwick-sanders
situation
where
the
closed
container
comes
off
of
the
train,
the
amtrak
coming
from
san
diego
to
boston.
in
that
situation,
had
the
defendants
gone
one
way
and
a
porter
with
a
trunk
gone
the
other
way,
and
the
arrest
was
made
at
that
time
so
that
the
closed
container
was
not
in
the
immediate
dominion
and
control,
the
area
of
arm's
reach
of
the
defendants,
you
had
a
closed
container
with
probable
cause,
you
still
are
going
to
need
a
warrant
for
that.
so
i
think
we're
asking
for
a
much
narrower
rule,
you
know,
and...
this
court
has
struggled
for
over
65
years
with
searches
of
vehicles.
in
ross
you
gave
us
a
bright
line
that
went
two-thirds
of
the
way,
and
we're
asking
you
to
draw
the
line
the
rest
of
the
way
so
that
the
officers
in
the
field--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
would
hope
not,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
foster
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
to
search
the
bag,
your
honor.
i
think
that
even
accepting
our
position
today,
the
warrant
would
still
apply
to
those...
to
that
closed
container.
mr.
robert
foster
oh,
i
think
there's
a
critical
difference,
your
honor.
the
difference
is
the
bag
in
this
case
had
been
placed
into
a
vehicle
and
the
vehicle
had
begun
to
leave
with
it.
mr.
robert
foster
but
your...
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
that's
the
analysis
that
was
in
chadwick
and
sanders,
and
i
think
that
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
say
you
look
at
the
mobility
at
the
moment
you
seize
it.
at
the
moment
you
seize
the
bag
from
the
porter
it
has
very
limited
mobility.
at
the
moment
you
seize
the
bag
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
it
has
the
same
mobility
as
the
vehicle,
as
any
other
closed
container.
mr.
robert
foster
it
does
not,
your
honor,
but
you
look,
after
johns,
thomas,
texas
v.
white,
at
mobility
at
the
point
of
seizure.
mr.
robert
foster
the
court,
this
court
has
held
that,
given
the
fact
that
you
have
probable
cause
at
the
moment
of
seizure,
since
you
can
seize
it
it
is
of
no
fourth
amendment
consequence
whether
you
search
it
immediately
or
search
it
later
on.
you
know,
in
johns,
of
course,
which
was
a
case
at
the
border,
they
waited
3
days
before
they
seized
it...
before
they
searched
it.
this
court
upheld
that
search
since
there
was
probable
cause
and
mobility
at
the
moment
of
seizure.
and
i
think
that's
the
point,
to
answer
justice
souter's--
mr.
robert
foster
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
at
a
slow
pace,
not
the
same
as
a
vehicle--
mr.
robert
foster
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
robert
foster
i
think,
though,
that
the
answer,
your
honor,
goes
back
to
the
original
holding
in
carroll,
which
is
that
the
mobility
of
the
car
is
such
that
it
can
be
rapidly
moved
outside
of
the
jurisdiction.
an
individual
simply
carrying
the
bag
or
pushing
it
is
not
mobile
to
that
degree.
mr.
robert
foster
well,
i
think
that
in
a
sense
this
court
made
the
first
step
of
that
analysis
in
carroll
by
saying
cars
are
different--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor.
and
ever
since
you
have
made
that
distinction.
and
i
think
as...
as
you
and
the
chief
justice
have
pointed
out
in
a
number
of
your
dissents,
given
the
mobility
of
the
vehicle,
given
the
mobility
of
what
has
been
placed
into
it--
mr.
robert
foster
--well,
i
thought
the
question
was--
mr.
robert
foster
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
but
the
bag
was
in
the--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
don't
believe
that
the
search
incident
cases
that
this
court
has
handled...
belton
talked
about
the
driver,
you
could
search--
mr.
robert
foster
--yes.
under
belton,
then
you
could,
your
honor.
but
this--
mr.
robert
foster
--no.
this
court
limited
belton
specifically
to
exclude
the
trunk.
mr.
robert
foster
well,
your
honor,
as
we
pointed
out
in
argument
2
in
the
brief,
yes,
because
once
the
bag
went
into
the
car,
once
the
car
began
moving,
it
was
very
clear
that
mr.
acevedo
was
transporting
drugs.
and
as
far...
my
research
indicates
both
the
federal
statute
and
every
state
has
a
statute
making
that
a
crime.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
under
a
number
of
different
doctrines.
mr.
robert
foster
well,
he
could
have,
your
honor,
but
i
think
this
case
presents
the
issue
that
arose
in
castlebury
and
arises
again,
and
arises
in
the
field
every
day.
while
the
facts
here
may
be
fairly
straightforward,
if
the
principle,
the
underlying
principle
that
caused
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
to
invalidate
the
search
bedevils
officers
in
the
field.
for
example,
in
ross,
if
the
informant
had
told
the
officers
mr.
ross
keeps
the
drugs
in
the
trunk
of
his
car,
and
in
a
pouch
in
the
trunk
and
scattered
through
the
trunk,
well,
then
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
particularized
probable
cause
as
to
the
bag,
and
unparticularized
probable
cause
as
to
the
whole
vehicle.
and
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
situation
where
you
are
asking
the
officers
to
begin
making
differentiations
as
to
whether
they
are
particularized
or
unparticularized
probable
causes,
and
not--
mr.
robert
foster
--but
what
if...
but
in
a
situation,
your
honor,
where
he
has
said
it's
in
a
bag
in
the
trunk,
and
additionally,
elsewhere.
it
seems--
mr.
robert
foster
--that's
right.
but
when
you
get
to
the
bag,
your
honor,
then
you'd
have
to
make
the
analysis
of
whether
you
needed
a
warrant,
because
your
information,
as
in
this
case,
points
to
this...
specifically
to
the
bag.
and
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
problem
that
we...
that
we're
asking--
mr.
robert
foster
--well,
certainly--
mr.
robert
foster
--he
certainly,
they
certainly
would
have
acted
properly
in
holding
the
bag
in
this
case
and
getting
the
warrant.
but
what
we're
saying
is
you
didn't
need
to
get
the
warrant
in
the
first
place.
that
by
being
in
the
vehicle
with
the
mobility
far
in
excess
of
a
porter
or
simply
carrying
it,
that
that
high
degree
of
mobility
causes
this
situation
to
be
significantly
different.
mr.
robert
foster
hum.
mr.
robert
foster
given--
mr.
robert
foster
--given
the
mobility
of
the
subway,
i
would
think
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
when
you're
dealing
with
a
rapidly
moving
mode
of
transportation--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
and
it
would.
and
i
think
that
they're
talking
about
is
to
rapidly
move
away
from
the
officers
who
are
there
trying
to
effect
the
arrest,
and
move
out
of
the
jurisdiction.
indeed,
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
on
the
metro
here
in
d.c.
you
can
end
up
outside
of
the
jurisdiction.
so
i
think
it's
the
same
problem.
i
think
it's
the
degree,
and
there
are
cases
talking
about
airplanes,
boats.
i
think
in
the
discussion
in
carney
one
of
you
came
up
with
a
hypothetical
of
the
houseboat
on
the
river,
the
same
kind
of
mobility.
mr.
robert
foster
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
dead
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
well,
but
even
if
you
go
to
magistrates,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
foster
--your
honor,
i
think
that
begs
a
question,
with
all
due
respect,
because
even
if
you
go
to
magistrate
and
get
a
search
warrant
you
have
defendants
challenging
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant.
i
mean,
the
fact
that
a
defendant
may
challenge
it
doesn't
resolve
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
or
is
not.
mr.
robert
foster
well,
my
experience
with
criminal
defense
attorneys,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
is
that
they'll
challenge
anything.
it's
like
justice
rehnquist
talked
about
hounds
attacking
foxes.
i
don't
think
that...
that
that
should
be
the
basis
of
a
decision
from
this
court.
i
think
the--
mr.
robert
foster
--well,
no,
i
think
it
works
the
other
way,
your
honor.
if
you
take
that
point
of
view
you
would
require
a
warrant
for
everything.
mr.
robert
foster
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
but
what
we're
saying
is--
mr.
robert
foster
--well,
i
think
the
question
is,
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
there
is
probable
cause,
where
it
is
particularized--
mr.
robert
foster
--how
do
i
know
there
is?
the
california
court
of
appeal
ruled
there
is,
and
i
think
the
facts
abundantly
show
there
is.
i
mean,
they
knew
for
a
fact
there
was
marijuana
in
the
apartment.
when
mr.
st.
george
came
out
he
was
carrying
part
of
the
marijuana.
it
was
clear
that
mr.
daza
was
manipulating
the
marijuana
because
he
had
thrown
away
the
inner
and
outer
wrappings
of
it.
and
then
mr.
acevedo
goes
in
carrying
nothing
and
comes
out
carrying
a
paper
bag
that
appears
to
be
full.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reasonable
conclusion
to
draw
from
that
is
they
are
breaking
up
the
load
of
marijuana,
and
it's
starting
to
be
distributed.
i
think
there's
abundant
probable
cause.
and
i
think
given
that,
then
the
question
becomes
what
conduct
we
want
from
the
officers.
and
it's
clear
these
officers
were
trying
to
comply
with
the
law.
they
had
left
to
get
the
search
warrant
at
the
time
for
the
apartment.
it
was
only
the
fortuity
of
mr.
acevedo
showing
up
at
10
minutes
after
12
as
opposed
to
40
minutes
after
12
that
brought
this
situation
about.
you
know,
the
fourth
amendment
talks
about
reasonable
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
officers,
and
i
think
it
was
under
these
facts.
they
were
trying
to
get
the
warrant
at
the
time
mr.
acevedo
appeared.
the
problem,
of
course,
remains,
and
this
court
had
talked
about
it
in
ross,
about
the
convenience
factor.
that
what
do
you
do
with
the
vehicle,
and
what
do
you
do
with
the
individual
if
we're
going
to
require
a
warrant
for
the
container?
well,
if
the
container...
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
container
contains
drugs,
you
have
then
suspicion
that
the
individual
has
been
possessing
and/or
transporting
drugs.
you
are
still
going
to
end
up
then,
if
you
require
a
warrant,
holding
the
defendant
and
the
passengers
and
holding
the
vehicle
until
you
have
obtained
the
warrant
and
learned
what
is
inside
of
the
bag.
so
you
don't
gain
anything
in
terms
of
the
convenience
that
this
court
was
concerned
with
in
ross.
if
you
give...
the
analogy
might
be
to
the
payton
case
that
this
court
talked
about,
that
when
mr....
you
need
a
search
warrant,
you
need
an
arrest
warrant
or
a
search
warrant
to
arrest
an
individual
in
his
home.
where
that
individual
goes
outside
of
the
home
and
goes
elsewhere,
you
don't
need
the
warrant.
i
think
that's
the
same
situation
here.
where
the
individual
has
a
closed
container,
you
would
need
a
warrant
to
search
that
closed
container.
but
when
he
coluntarily
and
intentionally
places
it
into
the
vehicle,
he
places
it
in
there
to
a
different
zone,
a
zone
of
mobility,
a
zone
of
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy.
and
given
that
rapid
mobility
on
the
part
of
the
vehicle,
you
should
be
able
to
search
it
without
a
warrant,
since
there
is
probable
cause.
the
question
remains
under
those
circumstances
what
fourth
amendment
value
is
served
by
requiring
a
warrant.
as
this
court
talked
about
in
carroll,
the
first
united
states
congress,
the
congress
that
wrote
the
fourth
amendment
and
sent
the
document
out
for
ratification
by
the
states,
made
a
distinction.
and
in
dealing
with
the
search
of
effects
in
an
individual's
home,
in
the
home
you
needed
a
search
warrant.
but
they...
that
came
out
of
the
problem
with
the
writs
of
assistance
under
the
british.
but
the...
one
of
the
very
first
bills
they
passed
was
a
customs
and
tonnage
revenue
raising
document,
and
in
that
they
allowed
for
searches
in
homes
only
with
the
warrant,
but
they
allowed
for
warrantless
searches
based
on
probable
cause
of
vessels
and
vehicles.
the
point
being
that
the
search
of
effects
outside
of
the
home
in
a
movable
vehicle
has
always
been
treated
differently,
even
by
those
founding
fathers
who
wrote
the
fourth
amendment.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor.
i'll
try
and
use
not
all
of
that
time.
justice
scalia,
you're
absolutely
correct.
the
situation
is
upside
down.
we've
set
up
a
situation
where
if
the
officer...
if
the
officers
have
too
much--
mr.
robert
foster
--and
i
thought
you
were
agreeing
with
me,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
think
you're
correct.
you
say
to
officers,
when
you
go
out
to
get
probable
cause,
go
out
and
do
your
investigation,
do
what
you
can
to
get
the
criminal,
but
don't
get
too
much
probable
cause,
because
if
you
get
too
much
probable
cause
you're
going
to
need
to
get
a
warrant.
and
i
think
the
whole--
mr.
robert
foster
--that's
right.
but
if
in
ross,
for
example--
mr.
robert
foster
--but
the
signal
you
send
to
the
officer
is...
in
ross,
when
they
got
the
information
that
ross
had
contraband
in
the
vehicle,
the
signal
you
send
to
the
officers
is
don't
ask
where,
because
if
you
ask
where
and
you
get
an
answer--
mr.
robert
foster
--the
confidential
or
reliable
informant
in
ross,
your
honor,
was
the
example
i
was
using.
mr.
robert
foster
no,
if
you
leave
chadwick
and
sanders
in
effect,
because
then
you're
saying
to
the
officers
if
you
know
too
much
you're
going
to
have
to
go
through
the
rigmarole
of
getting
a
warrant.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
that's
right.
and
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
think
you
want
to
encourage
officers
to
do
their
utmost
to
fully
investigate--
mr.
robert
foster
--if
they
have
probable
cause.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
within
the
goal
of
the
fourth
amendment,
because
you
still
have
the
requirement
of
probable
cause.
counsel
seems
to
try
and
broaden
my
argument
into
if
you've
got
probable
cause
to
search
the
bag,
you
can
search
the
whole
vehicle,
and
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
that's
not
what
we're
arguing.
we're
arguing
here
today
that
if
you
have
probable
cause
as
to
the
bag,
because
the
bag
is
in
a
vehicle,
you
should
be
able
to
search
the
bag.
we
did
not
make
any
argument
as
to
the...
expanding
any
rule
of
law
to
therefore
encompass
the
vehicle.
there
are
other
rules
of
law
coming
into
play
there.
justice
white,
one
point
i
wanted
to
make
in
response
to
your
question
about
couldn't
they
have
gotten
an
inventory
search
here.
that's
also
true
in
ross,
your
honor.
the...
having
found
the
gun
in
the
trunk
of
mr.
ross'
car,
the
officers
could
have
arrested
him
and
searched
the
entire
vehicle
as
an
inventory
search.
so
that
that...
the
fact
that
that
avenue
of
analysis
existed
in
ross
did
not
preclude
this
court
in
ross
from
reaching
the
issue,
and
i
would
hope
it
would
not
preclude
the
court
in
this
case
from
reaching
the
issue.
in
summary,
we
believe
your
decisions
in
carney,
ross--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor,
you
did,
but
the...
the
other
members
of
the
court
didn't.
mr.
robert
foster
at
any
rate,
your
honor,
this
case--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
would
hope
that
the
chief
justice's
position
in
chadwick
and
sanders
in
the
dissent,
along
with
justice
blackmun,
would
become
the
majority
rule.
we
would
urge
you
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeal.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
i
have
always
seen
it
to
be
the
ubiquitous
brown
paper
bag,
your
honor.
occasionally,
and
for
some
reason
the
drug
dealers
in
california
seem
to
be
this
year
favoring
u-haul
boxes.
but
i...
i
cannot
tell
you
the
why
or
the
reason.
[laughter]
thank
you,
your
honors.
