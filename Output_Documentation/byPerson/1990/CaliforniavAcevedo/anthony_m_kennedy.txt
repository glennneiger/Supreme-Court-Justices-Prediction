justice
kennedy
if
we
accept
your
rationale--
justice
kennedy
--isn't
the
next
logical
step
really
to
say
that
the
warrant
requirement
is
limited
only
to
houses
and
structures?
justice
kennedy
or
any
movable
object
that
a
person
is
carrying
with
him
and
that's--
justice
kennedy
--well,
but
if
it's
subject
to
his
control
and
there's
a
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
justice
kennedy
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
what's
left?
what's
left
of
the
doctrine?
justice
kennedy
in
that
example
that
justice
scalia
gave,
suppose
there
were
four
lucky
store
bags?
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
and
they're
all
in
the
back
seat.
justice
kennedy
oh,
and...
but
now
there
is
no
specific
bag
that
he
is
focused
on.
i
thought
that,
i
thought
your
rationale
was
that
if
there's
a
specific
bag,
he
can't
search
it,
but
that
if
it's
general,
he
can?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
so,
in
my
hypothetical
there
are
four
bags.
he's
not
sure
which
one
it
is.
he
doesn't
know
what
to
do.
justice
kennedy
he
knows
that
only
one
of
them
has
marijuana.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
think,
i
think
under
your
rationale
that
he
can
search,
and
that's
the
problem.
the
problem
is
that
the
more
generalized
his
privacy
in
the
car,
the
greater
the
officer's
right
is
to
search,
which
is
why
mr.
justice
scalia
says
the
whole
rationale
seems
upside
down.
