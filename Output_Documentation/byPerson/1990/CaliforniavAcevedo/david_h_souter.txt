mr.
foster--
justice
souter
--you
said
in
your
example
involving
the
porter
carrying
the
closed
container
that
you
need
a
warrant
for
that.
a
warrant
to
do
what?
to
stop
the
porter
and
detain
the
bag
or
to
search
the
bag?
justice
souter
all
right,
then
why,
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
shouldn't
you
say
that
in
this
case
that
you
could
seize
the
bag
from
the
trunk
of
the
car
without
a
warrant,
but
you
should
have
to
get
the
warrant
in
order
to
go
into
the
bag?
why
aren't
the...
why
aren't
the
two
situations
parallel?
justice
souter
no,
but
once
you...
once
you
have
taken
the
bag
the
vehicle
is
not
leaving
with
the
bag,
so
that
the
mobility
argument
is
just
as
beside
the
point
there
as
it
is
in
the
porter
case
once
you
have
taken
the
bag
from
the
porter.
justice
souter
how
does
it
have
it
after
you
have
seized
it?
justice
souter
if...
but
by--
justice
souter
--but
by
the
same
token
there
is
just
as
much
mobility
in
the
case
of
the
porter.
justice
souter
if
you
don't...
if
you
don't
seize
the
bag,
the
porter
is
going
to
take
it
away.
justice
souter
you
mean
he's
going
to
walk
slow
enough
so
that
you
can
get
the
warrant
before
he
gets
to
the
train?
[laughter]
justice
souter
no,
i
mean
that,
that
bag
is
going
to
disappear.
and
if
the
porter's...
if
the
car
is
mobile,
the
porter
is
mobile.
if
one
isn't,
the
other
isn't.
but
i'm
having
trouble
seeing
this
moment
of
seizure
distinction
as
between
the
porter
and
the
car.
justice
souter
but
doesn't
that
simply
throw
you
back
on
kind
of
a
black
letter
precedent
argument,
cars
are
different
from
porters?
i
mean,
hasn't
your
argument
really
sort
of,
sort
of
dropped
the
principle
and
just
said
look,
we're
going
to
have
a
separate
rule
for
cars
because
it's
just
more
difficult
to
draw
these
lines
with
cars
than
it
is
with
porters?
