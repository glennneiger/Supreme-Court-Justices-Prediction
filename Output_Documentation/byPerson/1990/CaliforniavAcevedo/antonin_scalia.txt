justice

mr.
anderson,
if
i
understand
the
principle
you're
arguing
for,
if
a
policeman
just
knows,
or
suspects
generally,
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
marijuana
somewhere
in
the
car,
he
can
open
the
bag?
justice
scalia
but
if
he's
more
certain
than
that,
he
not
only
knows
it's
somewhere
in
the
car,
he
suspects
it's
precisely
in
this
bag,
then
he
can't
open
the
bag?
doesn't
that
strike
you
as
very
strange?
justice
scalia
but
you
can't
search
it?
justice
scalia
but
if
all
you
knew
is,
or
the
only
information
you
have
is
that
there
is
this
car
and
somewhere
in
the
car
there
is
contraband,
then
you
can
open
it,
even
though
your
reason
for
opening
it
is
much
less
certain
than
the
reasoning
in
the
former
case?
that
just
seems
to
me,
just
upside
down.
the
more
certain
the
policeman
is
that
the
contraband
is
in
precisely
this
container,
the
less
able
he
is
to
open
the
container?
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
justice
scalia
i'm
looking
for
contraband.
justice
scalia
and
you're
telling
me
that
if
i
know
it's
in
this
package
i
can't
open
the
package.
but
if
i
just
think
it's
somewhere
in
the
car,
then
i
can
open
the
package.
it
makes
no
sense.
justice
scalia
--that's
the
distinction
that
you
want
police
officers
to
be--
justice
scalia
--to
have
to
worry
about,
whether
they
said--
justice
scalia
--it
would
seem
to
me
to
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
say
that
if
that's
the
information
he
has,
he
can't
search
the
whole
car.
the
only
thing
he
can
search
is
the
bag.
whereas
if
the
information
he
has
is
more
general,
it's
somewhere
in
the
car,
he
can
search
the
whole
car.
but
that's
not
the
position
you're
saying.
you're
saying
that
if
he
has
the
specific
information
about
the
bag,
he
can
search
neither
the
bag
nor
the
car.
justice
scalia
we've
crossed
that
line
when
we
made
the
exception
for
automobiles.
i
mean,
the
manipulation
that
you
just
described
can
occur
with
anything.
you
see
somebody
leaving
the
house.
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
may
have
contraband
on
him,
you
don't
know
in
what
particular
container
it
is.
you
could
say
the
same
thing.
the
police,
instead
of
running
and
getting
a
warrant,
could
wait
until
he
got
into
the
car,
and
then,
and
then
search
the
car.
that
would
be
perfectly
lawful
without
a
warrant,
right,
so
long
as
they
don't
know
what
container
it's
in?
justice
scalia
so...
i
mean,
once
we've
made
that
decision
that
cars
are
different,
that
manipulation
is
inevitable.
justice
scalia
oh,
well,
there--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about.
we're
just
talking
about...
i
mean,
i
agree
with
all
of
that.
that
seems
to
me
perfectly
reasonable.
but
can
you
search
the
bag?
that's
all
we're
talking
about,
not
the
whole
car.
justice
scalia
i
knew
you
would
agree
with
me.
[laughter]
