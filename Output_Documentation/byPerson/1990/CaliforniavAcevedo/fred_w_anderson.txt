mr.
fred
w.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
the
search...
this
case
is
the
search
of
a
container,
not
the
search
of
a
vehicle.
the
fourth
amendment
proscribes
all
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
and
it
is
a
cardinal
principle
that
searches
conducted
outside
the
judicial
process
without
prior
approval
by
a
judge
or
magistrate
are
per
se
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
subject
to
only
a
few
specifically
established
and
well
delineated
exceptions.
this
case
is
not
an
exception.
carroll
v.
united
states
is
a
recognized
exception.
it
is
recognized
and
affirmed
most
recently
in
ross,
and
it
is
well
established.
there
is
no
need
to
overrule
ross.
ross
explains
carroll.
carroll
and
ross
state
the
exceptions,
or
state
the
exception.
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
search
a
vehicle,
you
can
search
and
seize
everything
in
it,
including
the
containers.
this
is
the
search
of
a
package
not
incident
to
an
arrest.
the
package
was...
a
package
placed
in
a
vehicle
does
not
lose
any
privacy
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
just
because
it's
placed
in
a
vehicle.
what
we
have
to
look
at
when
determining
probable
cause
is
what
do
we
have
probable
cause
in?
we
have
in
this
case
probable
cause
in
a
bag.
now
i'm
not
conceding
that
there
is
probable
cause.
but
for
the
purpose
of
the
argument,
if
there
is
probable
cause
in
the
bag,
that's
the
only
thing
there
is
probable
cause
in.
if
the
bag
is
placed
in
the
vehicle,
the
vehicle
doesn't
somehow
gain
an
element
of
probable
cause.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
absolutely.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
under
belton
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
under
schimmel,
under--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--i'm
not
sure
that...
i'm
not
sure
there's
a
difference.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
no,
that's
not
what
i
would
base
it
on.
you
have...
it's
the
item
that
you
have
the
probable
cause
in.
if
the
bag
was
in
the
trunk
and
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
vehicle
contained
contraband,
then
you
can
search
the
bag,
the
contents
of
the
vehicle
under
ross.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
no.
without
an
arrest.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
well,
under
ross--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--if
you
have...
if
your
probable
cause
just
exists
in
the
package,
in
the
container--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--then,
by
placing...
just
the
mere
fact
of
placing
this
container
in
the
vehicle
doesn't
give
you
probable
cause
to
search
the
whole
vehicle,
because
what
the
ag
would
have
you
believe
is
that
you
placed
this
container
with
probable
cause
in
the
trunk,
somehow
this
probable
cause
seeps
throughout
the
whole
car,
and
now
you
can
search
the
whole
car.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
i
disagree
with
the
first
part.
there
wasn't
probable
cause
to
arrest.
but
in
order--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--all
right.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
certainly
in
answer
to
your
question
it
is
more
intrusive
to
open
the
bag
without
the
arrest.
however--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
i'm
sorry.
yes,
i
see
what
you
mean.
no,
no,
your
honor.
certainly
it
would
be
more
intrusive
just
to...
to
take
the
person
into
custody.
in
this
case,
though,
that's
not
what
we
have.
mr.
acevedo
was
not
arrested
and
searched
incident
to
arrest,
as
in
schimmel
or
as
in
belton.
all
they
did
is
they
went
to
the
vehicle--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--that's
true.
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
that's
correct.
that's--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--no,
your
honor,
because
you
need
to
know...
you
need
to
know
when
the
probable
cause
is
determined
and
where
the
item
that
is
sought
to
be
searched
is.
if
he
receives
information,
for
example
in
ross,
if
the
information
was
that
bandit
has
contraband
in
a
zippered
pouch,
or
in
that
case
a
brown
paper
bag,
in
the
trunk
of
his
vehicle,
then
you
have
specific
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
bag
in
the
trunk
of
his
vehicle
contains
contraband.
when
you
pop
the
trunk
of
that
vehicle
you're
looking
for
the
brown
paper
bag,
and
nothing
more.
therefore
you
can
seize
it
under
the
court's--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--but
you
cannot
search
it.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
what
you
want
to
determine
is
what
you're
looking
for.
are
you
looking
for
a
car
with
contraband
in
it,
or
are
you
looking
for
a
package
with
contraband
in
it?
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
that's
fine.
but
where
is
the
contraband?
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i'll
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
because
i
believe
that
if
you
know
exactly
where
the
contraband
is,
then
you
may
seize
whatever
it's
in
and
get
a
warrant
to
search
it.
however,
if
that
contraband...
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
that
contraband
is
in
an
auto
or
not.
however,
if
you
believe
that
the
container
of
the
contraband
is
a
vehicle,
the
court
has
allowed
under
carroll
and
later
under
ross...
this
exceptions
the
fourth
amendment,
the
exception
being
if
you
have
contraband
in
a
vehicle,
then
you
can
search
without
a
warrant.
you
can
search
the
vehicle
and
all
of
its
contents,
including
the
containers.
now
that...
the
petitioner
wants
a
bright
line.
that's
a
bright
line.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
yes,
i
would
agree.
i
would
agree
that
the
automobile
is
a
unique
situation.
but
as
mr.
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
if
the
court
allows
the
search
of...
under
these
circumstances,
basically
the
fourth
amendment
is
gone
as
far
as
it
relates
to
automobiles.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
but
you
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
search
anyway.
you
can't
search
without
probable
cause.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
right.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
the
problem
with
that
is
the
belton
case,
of
course.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
that's
my
understanding
of
ross.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
that's
how
i
interpret
ross.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
that's
correct,
because
he's
got--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--absolutely,
because--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--because
the
informant
in
your
example
said,
said
mr.
police
officer,
this
person
has
a
brown
paper
bag
with
a
lucky
store
symbol
on
the
side
of
it
that's
wrapped
up
at
the
top,
and
he's
placed
this
either
in
the
trunk,
in
the
back
seat,
or
someplace
in
his
vehicle,
and
i
know
it's
there
because
i
just
saw
it
there
10
minutes
ago.
now,
the
officer's
attention
is
directed
towards
that
vehicle.
it
is
not
directed...
i
mean,
excuse
me,
that
paper
bag.
it
is
not
directed
towards
the
vehicle.
that
paper
bag
is
what's
important
to
the
officer,
wherever
it
is.
it
could
be
in
a
house,
it
could
be--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--he
can...
he
needs
a
warrant
for
the
bag.
he
may
search
the
car
until
he
finds
the
bag,
under
the
cases
that
end
in
place.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
all
right.
if
there
are
four
bags,
all
identical,
and
he
can't
tell
which--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--and
they're
all
in
the
back
seat,
he
can
certainly
take
possession
of
all
four
of
them
and
get
a
warrant.
i
know
that
there
is
dope
in
one
of
these
bags,
to
the
magistrate--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--if
there
is
a
specific
bag,
he
cannot
search
it.
if
it's
general,
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
well,
you
have
described
them
as
all
four
being
identical,
all
four
being
lucky
bags.
certainly
he
has
a
basis
to--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--he
has
a
basis
to
seize
all
four
and
get
a
search
warrant.
a
judge
would
issue
a
warrant
for
the
search
of
all
four
bags--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--i
understand
the
argument,
and
i
don't
agree
with
it,
because
this
court
has
held
that
if
you
look
at
the
car
and
you've
got
probable
cause
to
believe
the
car
contains
contraband,
you
can
search
it.
but
this
court
has
also
held,
under
chadwick
and
sanders
and
the
cases
that
follow
it,
that
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
footlocker,
a
suitcase,
or
a
paper
bag,
and
ross
says
there
is
no
difference
between
a
paper
bag
and
a
louis
vuitton
briefcase,
that
you've
got
to
get
a
warrant.
and
the
mere
contact,
as
in
chadwick,
the
mere
contact
with
the
footlocker
with
the
car
is
incidental.
now,
in
this
case
i
would
submit
to
you
that
why
wouldn't
the
officers
just
sit
there
and
wait?
they
see
the
person
coming
out
with
a
paper
bag,
they
have
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
it
contains
contraband.
well,
let's
follow
him
and
let's
wait
until
it
gets
in
the
car.
by
golly,
it's
in
the
car,
we
can
search
it.
he
gets
to
his
house.
he
walks
into
his
house.
are
we
now
going
to
let
him
search
the
house
without
a
warrant?
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
last
question
to
the
attorney
general,
where
do
we
draw
the
line
in
this?
and
if
he
walks
in
the
house,
are
we
now
going
to
let
them
search
the
whole
house,
or
are
we
just
going
to
let
them
search
the
front
room
where
the
bag
is?
and
the
answer
is
you've
got
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
the
line
has
been
drawn.
the
cases
are
clear.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
well--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--the
problem
is
that...
well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
agree
with
carroll
or
ross,
but--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--but--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--in
this
particular
case
what
you
have
is
the
center
of
attention
focused
on
a
package.
as
i
mentioned,
the
first
thing
i
said
was
this
is
not
the
search
of
a
vehicle.
this
is
the
search
of
a
package
that
happened
to
be
placed
in
a
vehicle.
and
that's
the
distinction
that
i
see
that
the
cases
make,
and
i
see
this
case...
that
distinction
made
in
ross.
and
ross
goes
to
a,
to
the...
to
the
vehicle
as
a
container,
and
you
have
probable
cause
to
that,
as
to
that
vehicle
being
a
container.
now
we're
going
to
give
an
exception,
we're
going
to
follow
carroll.
we're
going
to
allow
you
police
officers
to
search
the
car
because
of
its
unique
character,
because
it's
so
mobile,
and
because
we
have
pervasive
governmental
interests
in
regulating
vehicles.
we're
going
to
allow
this
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
to
search
this
container
which
you
know
contains,
or
have
probable
cause
to
believe
contains,
contraband.
but
it
does
not
say,
carroll
does
not
say,
ross
does
not
say
you
can
search
any
package
that's
placed
in
a
vehicle
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
package
first
contains
some
contraband.
and
what
i'm
submitting
to
you
is
to
adopt
the
petitioner's
view
would
be
to
adopt
the
view
that
if
you
place
contraband
in
a
container
in
a
vehicle,
that
that
contraband
somehow
seeps
throughout
the
entire
vehicle,
and
infects
the
whole
vehicle
such
that
you
can
search
it.
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
what
if
you
take
a
suitcase
or
a
paper
bag
with
contraband
onto
the
subway?
well
then
can
you
search
the
whole
subway,
the
whole
car?
can
you
search
the
whole
train?
can
you
search
the
bus?
can
you
search
the
airplane?
just
because
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
container,
a
paper
bag,
whatever
it
is.
now,
you
could
argue
that
okay,
this
is
mr.
acevedo's
car.
unfortunately
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
it
is
in
fact
mr.
acevedo's
car.
but
what
if
it
was
somebody
else's
car
he
gets
in?
can
you
then
search
this
other
person's
car
because
acevedo
got
in
with
a
paper
bag
containing
dope
in
it?
no.
of
course
not.
but
yet
if...
and
then
if
acevedo
gets
in
a
taxicab--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--without
a
warrant,
no,
you
cannot.
because
the
bag
is...
the
bag...
in
ross
they
have
held...
this
court
has
held
that
the
paper
bag
is
no
different
from
the
luggage,
and
the
luggage,
you
have
stated
that
you
expect
a
degree
of
privacy
in
there.
you
must
have
a
warrant
to
search
that.
the...
there's
a
request
for
the...
for
a
bright
line
to
be
drawn
to
guide
police
officers,
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
there
is
a
bright
line.
it's
called
the
fourth
amendment.
if
you
want
to
search
something,
get
a
warrant.
well,
we've
drawn
an
exception
to
that
bright
line.
we've
said
well,
if
it's
a
vehicle,
under
certain
circumstances
you
may
search.
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
vehicle
contains
contraband,
then
you
can
search
the
vehicle
and
every
container
in
it
under
carroll
and
under
ross.
however,
the
third
situation,
we
get
to
a
package.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
if
you've
got
a
package,
you've
got
probable
cause,
see
rule
number
1:
get
a
warrant.
just
because
a
package
is
placed
in
a
vehicle
doesn't
mean
that
it
loses
its
identity
or
its
private...
privacy.
if
this
court
reverses
the
lower
court
it
will
create
an
entirely
new
line
of
exceptions
to
the
fourth
amendment,
examples
of
which
i
pointed
out
earlier.
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
address
just
briefly
is
the
point
on
probable
cause.
first
of
all,
the
court
of
appeals
makes
one
error
in
their
analysis
of
the
facts,
and
that
is
that
the
probable--
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
--no,
i
didn't.
mr.
fred
w.
anderson
no,
i
don't
believe
i
did
in
opposition
to
certiorari.
however,
i
believe
that
the
court
can
review
this
under...
as
a
plain
error
under
rule
24.1.
the
probable
cause
is
deficient
firstly
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
is
that
they
have
got
a
bag
that
is
similar
in
size
to
the
nine
bags
that
were
found
to
be
in
the
cooler.
but
that
just
isn't
borne
out
by
the
facts.
in
fact
the
nine
bags
each
weighed
2
pounds.
acevedo's
bag
containing
marijuana
weighed
between
a
quarter
and
a
half
pound.
the
attorney
general
alludes
to
a
footnote...
in
his
first
footnote
to
the
reply
brief,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that.
now,
the
other
problem
with
probable
cause
is
that
the
attorney
general
points
out
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
i
don't
argue
with
that.
however,
in
his
totality
you
have
the
police
officer
that
stops
acevedo
and
searches
his
vehicle.
he
assumes
that
he
knows
about
st.
george,
and
that's
not
in
the
record
either.
we
have
no
information
in
the
record
that
the
officer
that
searched
acevedo's
bag
knew
anything
about
the
results
of
the
search
of
st.
george.
in
fact
we
have
no
information
in
the
record
which
even
indicates
that
the
officer
that
searched
acevedo's
bag
knew
anything
about
st.
george
even
leaving
the
apartment,
let
alone
what
was
in
st.
george's
knapsack.
so
the
record
is
really
deficient,
and
my
example
in
the
brief
i
believe
sets
forth
the
facts
as
they
are
on
this
record.
and
that
is
that
you
have
an
individual
who
walks
into
a
house.
i
will
concede
that
there
is...
that
there's
no
question
that
we
know
that
there
is
marijuana
in
the,
in
the
apartment.
he
walks
in
there
empty-handed,
he
walks
out
10
minutes
later
with
a
brown
paper
bag
that
appears
to
be
full.
the
officer
described
it
as
similar
to
a
lunch
bag.
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
i
would
think
that
it's
deficient
in
probable
cause.
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
suspicion,
as
in
place,
and
the
officer
could
have
stopped
and
run
some
kind
of
a
cursory
terry-type
situation
investigation,
but
nothing
more
than
that.
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
mobility
of
the
vehicle,
but
again,
if
you
view
this
as
the
search
of
a
package
and
not
the
search
of
a
vehicle,
then
you
don't
even
need
to
get
into
the
mobility
of
the
vehicle.
furthermore,
justice
o'connor
mentioned
couldn't
he
be
searched
as
incident
to
arrest?
yes,
he
could,
but
he
wasn't
in
this
case.
he
wasn't
placed
under
arrest.
he
wasn't
searched
incident
to
the
arrest.
however,
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
when
he
was
in
the
vehicle
would
not
cover
what
was
in
the
trunk,
because
under
belton
you
can
search
what's
in
the
car,
but
you
can't
get
into
the
trunk.
now,
the
other
thing
as
to
an
inventory
search,
yes,
if
they
had
arrested
him,
hauled
his
car
in,
and
searched
it
on
an
inventory
search,
yes,
they
could
have
gotten
there.
but
again,
they
didn't
do
it
in
this
case,
nor
did
they
arrest
him
for
transportation
of
marijuana.
in
summary,
i
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision
on
either
of
two
bases:
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
any
type
of
search,
or
secondly,
that
this
is
the
search
of
a
package
and
not
the
search
of
a
vehicle.
thank
you.
