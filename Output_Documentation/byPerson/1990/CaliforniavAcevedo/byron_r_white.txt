justice

so
that
we'll
have
no
worries
the
next
65
years?
justice

0
[inaudible].
justice
white
and
ever
since.
justice
white
is
there
really
very
much
at
stake
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
asked
you
that
if
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
marijuana
in
this
bag
and
it
was
in
the
car,
you
could
arrest
the
driver
of
the
car.
justice
white
i'll
ask
you
the
question.
justice
white
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest,
wasn't
there?
justice
white
well,
if
the
officer
had
taken
the
course
of
arresting
the
person,
they
could
have
carried
out
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
because
it
is
a
car,
and
searched
everywhere
in
the
car,
including
the
bag.
justice
white
isn't
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
what
if
it's
a
bag
in
the...
in
the
back
seat?
justice
white
but
not
in
the,
not
in
the
trunk?
justice
white
and...
so
a
police
officer
really
needn't
be...
law
enforcement
needn't
be
very
much
impeded
by
the
ruling
in
this
case
because
the
officer
could
have
just
have
handled
it
differently.
justice
white
well,
that's
never
going
to
get
you
out
of
the
jurisdiction.
i
suppose
it
would
in
new
york,
it
easily
could.
justice
white
well,
mr.
foster--
justice
white
--it's
easy,
i
suppose,
to
say
that
whenever
there
is
probable
cause,
why
do
you
have
to
wait
for
a
warrant.
but
at
least
in
this
case
the
existence
of
probable
cause
is
challenged,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and,
of
course
you're
the
petitioner
but
the
respondent
says
there
is
no
probable
cause
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
dead
wrong.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
here
it
is,
and
that's
the
reason
why
you
go
to
magistrates,
to
find
out
whether--
justice
white
--there
is
probable
cause
or
not.
justice
white
i
know,
but
challenging
the...
challenging
the
warrant
is
a
different
matter
than
the...
just
challenging
the...
at
least
you
have
the
assurance...
at
least
you
have
the
assurance
that
the
issue
has
been
presented
to
a
magistrate.
justice
white
well,
on
that
basis,
why,
we
should
never
even
fool
around
with
warrants.
justice
white
i
know,
but
your...
if
you
take
your
point
of
view
you
could
just
forget
warrants.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--what
good
does
it
ever
do
then,
in
your
point
of
view?
justice
white
how
do
you
know
there
is?
justice
white
if
the
bag
hadn't
been
put
in
the
trunk,
but
he
just
entered
the
car
with
the
bag,
if
there
is
probable
cause,
such
as
we
are
assuming,
the...
there
could
have
been
an
arrest.
justice
white
and
if
the
bag
were
found
in
the
back
seat,
it
could
be
searched?
justice
white
under
belton.
justice
white
so
you're
suggesting
we
should
continue
to
recognize
a
rational
difference
between
having
the
bag
in
the
trunk
and
having
a
bag
in
the
back
seat?
justice
white
and
the
difference,
i
suppose,
is
in
the
degree
of
the
expectation
of
privacy,
is
that
it?
justice
white
if
you
make
an
arrest?
justice
white
no?
okay.
justice
white
but
if
you
just
have
probable
cause
to
believe
what,
you
can't
search?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
under
your
position
i
take
it
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
bag,
the
unopened
bag
was
in
the
trunk
or
in
the
back
seat
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
because...
as
long
as
the
probable
cause
relates
specifically
to
the
bag?
justice
white
i
know,
but...
there's
no
arrest.
and
a
lot
of
times,
i
suppose,
a
driver
of
the
car,
you
may
not
have
any
real
probable
cause
to
arrest
that
person.
you
just
know
that
there's...
you
just
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
contraband
in
that
car
and
it's
being
transported
in
that
car.
and
under
ross
you
can
search
anywhere,
as
long
as
you
haven't
got
some
specific
notion
about
where
it
is
in
the
car.
justice
white
but
on
your
theory,
i
take
it,
it
doesn't
make
any...
if
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
it's
in
a
paper
bag,
and
you
find
the
paper
bag
in
the
back
seat,
you
can't
open
it.
justice
white
yes.
the
distinction
that
the
police
officer
is
going
to
have
to
have
in
mind,
under
your
theory,
i
suppose,
is
whether
somebody
told
him
marijuana
is
being
taken
away
in
this
car.
in
that
case,
he
can
search
the
whole
car,
including
all
the
containers.
but
if
somebody
said
a
bag
of
marijuana
is
being
taken
away
in
this
car,
then,
then
he
can't
search
anything,
neither
the
car
nor
the
bag.
all
he
can
do
is
impound
the
car.
that's--
justice
white
or
with
congress.
[laughter]
justice
white
i
dissented
in
ross.
justice
white
i
dissented
in
ross.
justice
white
that's
the
rule.
[laughter]
justice
white
you
would
like
it
not
to
be,
though?
