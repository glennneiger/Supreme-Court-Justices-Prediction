chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1690,
california
v.
charles
steven
acevedo.
mr.
foster.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
foster.
mr.
anderson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
anderson,
i
don't
think
it's
useful
to
refer
to
the
automobile
as
a
container,
as
if
it
were
like
a
trunk
or
a
bag.
i
think
our
cases
have
treated
the
automobile
not
as
a
container,
but
as
something
almost
sui
generis.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
fourth
amendment
isn't
gone.
we
would
have
interpreted
the
fourth
amendment
not
to
require
a
warrant,
but
to
require
only
probable
cause.
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
of
the
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
didn't
cross-petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
did
you,
mr.
anderson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
didn't
raise
this
point
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
anderson.
mr.
foster,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
foster.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
