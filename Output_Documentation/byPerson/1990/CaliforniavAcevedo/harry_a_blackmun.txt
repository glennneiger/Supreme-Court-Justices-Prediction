the
first
case
is
no.
89-1690,
california
against
acevedo.
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
and
it
is
another
one
having
to
do
with
the
validity
of
an
automobile
search.
the
police
observed
the
respondent
leaving
an
apartment
was
known
to
contain
marijuana
with
a
brown
paper
bag,
the
usual
brown
paper
back,
and
he
placed
the
bag
in
the
trunk
of
his
car,
the
police
stopped
the
car,
opened
the
trunk
and
the
bag
and
found
marijuana.
the
respondent's
motion
to
suppress
the
drug
was
denied
and
he
then
pleaded
guilty.
california
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
marijuana
should
have
been
suppressed.
it
found
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
bag
contained
drugs,
but
lacked
probable
cause
to
suspect
that
the
car,
itself,
otherwise
contained
contraband.
and
it
concluded
that
the
paper
bag
could
not
be
opened
without
a
warrant.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
in
a
search
extending
only
to
a
container
within
an
automobile,
the
police
may
search
the
container
without
a
warrant
where
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it
holds
contraband.
in
the
case
of
carroll
against
the
united
states,
decided
in
1925,
provides
one
rule
to
govern
all
automobile
searches.
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
does
not
preclude
the
court
from
eliminating
the
warrant
required
in
the
case
of
arkansas
against
sanders
decided
in
1979
which
we
feel
affords
minimal
protection
to
a
privacy
interest.
this
holding
does
not
extend
the
carroll
doctrine
nor
does
it
broaden
the
scope
of
permissible
automobile
searches.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
statement
and
would
affirm
the
judgment
below.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
justice
marshall.
