justice

mr.
foster--
justice
o'connor
--would,
would
those
facts
as
you
have
described
them
give
rise
to
probable
cause
sufficient
to
have
arrested
the
individual?
justice
o'connor
and
could
the
sack
then
have
been
searched
as
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest
or
an
inventory
search?
justice
o'connor
that's
a
little
bit
of
a
weak
argument.
when
you
put
something
in
the
trunk
of
a
car
you
don't
really
expect
the
world
to
be
looking
in
and
seeing
what's
there,
do
you?
justice
o'connor
how
about
an
inventory
search
of
the
vehicle?
justice
o'connor
well,
so
your
answer
basically
to
justice
white
and
to
me
is,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
individual
could
have
been
arrested
and
the
bag
could
have
been
searched--
justice
o'connor
--under
different
doctrines.
justice
o'connor
well,
on
these
facts
there
was
undoubtedly
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
individual,
to
make
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
to
impound
the
vehicle,
and
to
make
an
inventory
search.
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
assume
there
was.
justice
o'connor
then
what's
more
intrusive,
to
have
the
police
arrest
the
individual
and
make
the
search
that
way,
or
to
have
the
police
open
the
bag
without
an
arrest?
justice
o'connor
that's
more
intrusive,
to
open
the
bag
and
not
arrest
the
individual?
that's
more
intrusive
in
your
opinion?
justice
o'connor
more
intrusive
than
placing
someone
under
arrest
and
conducting
a
search?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
point
is
that
if
you
accept
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
this
individual
emerged
from
the
apartment
carrying
a
bag
of
marijuana,
then
there
was
probable
cause
to
have
arrested
him.
