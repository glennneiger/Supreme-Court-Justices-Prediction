justice
stevens
but,
mr.
foster,
was
it
any
different
than
the
voluntary
intentional
act
in
arkansas
against
sanders?
justice
stevens
so
you
basically
want
us
to
overrule
arkansas
against
sanders?
justice
stevens
isn't
it
correct
that
in
his
separate
opinion
in
that
case
that
chief
justice
burger
made
the
very
distinction
that
you're
challenging
here?
justice
stevens
so
you're
basically
challenging
his
analysis
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
stevens
i'm
talking
about
chief
justice
burger.
justice
stevens
he's
the
source
of
the
particular
distinction
that
is
at
issue
here.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
you
don't
have
any
mobility
anymore
after
the
vehicle
has
been
stopped
and
you
have
got
the
container.
why
is
it
any
different
than
if
you
stopped
him
before
he
got
in
the
vehicle?
justice
stevens
well,
you
rely
heavily
on
ross,
and
i
wonder
if
there's
a
single
word
in
the
ross
opinion
that
casts
doubt
on
arkansas
against
sanders.
justice
stevens
the
reason
you
didn't
have
to
reach
it
is
because
of
this
distinction.
justice
stevens
as
did
arkansas
against
sanders.
justice
stevens
no,
not
forever.
until
you
got
a
warrant.
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
that's
right.
if
they
have
unparticularized
probable
cause
as
to
the
whole
vehicle,
ross
is
perfectly
clear
you
can
search
the
whole
vehicle.
justice
stevens
well,
additionally
elsewhere,
if
that's
enough
probable
cause,
you
can
search
elsewhere.
justice
stevens
and
the
worst
that,
even
under...
apart
from
the
rationales
that
justice
o'connor
and
justice
white
developed,
the
rationale
of
place
also
protects
the
officer.
he
can
always
just
hang
onto
the
bag
until
he
gets
a
warrant.
justice
stevens
isn't
that
what
place
indicates
rather
clearly?
justice
stevens
what
about
a
person
with
a
suitcase
that
you
figure
has
drugs
in
it
about
to
get
on
a
subway?
can
you
search
the
suitcase
then?
justice
stevens
under
your
view.
justice
stevens
you
can
obviously
detain
it.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
stevens
no,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
right,
is
it?
it
isn't
too
much
probable
cause.
it's
what
the
probable
cause
focuses
on.
justice
stevens
if
it
was
generally
focussed
on
the
vehicle
you
would
normally
have
to
get...
you'd
get
a
warrant
to
search
the
entire
vehicle.
justice
stevens
well,
you're
not...
who
is
the
officer
going
to
be
asking?
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
the
officer
would
want
to
know
as
precise
as
he
could
what
he...
where
he...
the
contraband
is?
justice
stevens
you're
going
to
have
to
get
a
warrant
before
you
open
private
luggage.
justice
stevens
and
we
should
not
encourage
that?
justice
stevens
to
be
able
to
open
luggage
without
getting
warrants?
