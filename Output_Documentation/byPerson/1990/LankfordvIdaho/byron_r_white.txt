justice
white
this
was
an
arraignment,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
in
this
case.
justice
white
the
transcript,
there
was
a
transcript
of
the
hearing,
and--
justice
white
how
did
you
know
that?
justice
white
and,
and
it
was
entered,
that
order
was
entered,
or
that
letter...
was
it
a
letter
or
what?
justice
white
but
that,
that
was
filed
because,
as
a
result
of
this
hearing--
justice
white
--when
the
judge,
the
judge
says
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
statute
calls
for
this,
and
the
defense
attorney
says
i
don't
either,
but
i'm
asking
for
it
anyway.
and...
at
that
hearing,
this
pleading
was
filed
as
a
result
of
that
hearing?
justice
white
you
just
said
that
that
transcript
of
that
hearing
was
not
available
to
you.
justice
white
well,
did
you
ask
for
it?
justice
white
you
were
denied?
justice
white
and
what
was
the
ground
for
the
denial?
you
couldn't
even
get
a
transcript
of
the
trial?
justice
white
um
hum.
didn't
he
also
say
that
you
had
tapes
of
the
hearings?
justice
white
where
did
we
ever
get
a
transcript
of
that
hearing,
do
you
suppose?
justice
white
what
do
you
mean
developed?
it
was
transcribed
from--
justice
white
--typewritten
from
a
tape?
justice
white
--they
ordered
the
prosecutor
to
say,
and
then
the
prosecutor
filed
a
pleading
in
response
to
that.
justice
white
so
the
court
never
said
anything
about,
about
whether
the
death
penalty
would
be
sought
or
not.
justice
white
the...
i
suppose
that
judge,
had
that
judge
tried
a
death
case
before?
justice
white
he
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
sort
of
a
strange
request.
he
didn't
know
whether
the
statute
provided
for
it,
and
the
pros...
and
the
defense
attorney
said
he
didn't
either,
but
he
was
still
asking
for
it.
is
that
the
regular
procedure
in...
or,
have
there
been
many
death
cases--
justice
white
--is
there
something,
from
something
you
said
before
it
sounded
as
though
when
you
get
to
the
penalty
phase
in
a
capital
case,
is
there
something
like
a
pretrial
order
entered
outlining
the
issues
that
are
to
be
tried?
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
which
order?
