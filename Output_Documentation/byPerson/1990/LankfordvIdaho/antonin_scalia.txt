justice
scalia
why
would
the
death
penalty...
there
is
an
idaho
case
that
neither
side
cites,
by
the
way,
called
state
v.
rossi,
which
didn't
involve
the
death
penalty,
but
it
involved
a
case
in
which
the
judge
imposed
a
sentence
double
that
that
the
state
had
recommended.
and
it
was
appealed
on
the
same
grounds
that
you
are
using
today
to
the
idaho
supreme
court,
and
the
idaho
supreme
court
said,
we
hold
that
a
trial
court
is
not
bound
by
a
sentence
recommendation
made
by
the
state,
even
though
that
recommendation
was
offered
in
conjunction
with
a
negotiated
plea.
why,
why
would
it
be
any
different
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
that
critical?
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--not
insofar
as
whether
you're
bound
by
the
recommendation
of
the
prosecution
is
concerned.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
thinking
in
some
newly
created
judicial
system
that
whatever
the
state
recommends
is
the
maximum
you
could
get,
but
you
know
in
idaho
that
that's
not
the
case.
this
case,
idaho
supreme
court
case
was
before
this
litigation.
justice
scalia
suppose
what
the
court
had
said
was,
in
a
third
paragraph
of
that
order,
and
in
the
event
the
state
does
not
educe
further
evidence
of
aggravating
factors,
the
court
will,
on
its
own
motion,
weigh
the
aggravating
factors
disclosed
at
trial
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate.
could
the
court
have
done
that?
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
how
the
calligrapher
is
one
of
them.
are
you
saying
you
couldn't
have
introduced
the
calligrapher
because
it
wasn't
a
capital
case?
i
was
a
capital
case.
justice
scalia
as
far
as
that
rule
of
evidence
is
concerned?
justice
scalia
but
your
objection
would
have,
would
have
been
just
as
valid
whether
it
was
a
capital,
whether
you
knew
the
death
sentence
was
going
to
be
imposed
or
not,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
but...
but
aren't
those
aggravating
factors
relevant
to
the
length
of
the
prison
sentence
as
well?
justice
scalia
and
you
think
we
would
not
have
applied
that
rule
simply
because
the
state
here
had
said
that
it
was
not
going
to,
going
to
seek
the
death
penalty?
justice
scalia
you
say
there
was
no
reason...
under
idaho
law
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
it
was
at
issue?
justice
scalia
why
was
that?
do
you
have
any
case
that
even
suggests
that
what
the
prosecutor
asks
is
the
upper
limit?
justice
scalia
well,
there
might
not
have
been
a
reason
to
think
that
a
judge
would
normally
do
that,
but
you
think
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
it
could
be
done
in
law?
i
mean,
i
understand
how
you
could
reasonably
believe
the
chances
were
99
to
1
that
the
judge
would,
of
course,
if
the
state
wasn't
seeking
death,
not
impose
death.
but
you're
saying
that
you
thought
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
judge
could
not
do
it?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
scalia
the
legal
possibility.
justice
scalia
--i
think
we
have
it
in
the
record
here,
too.
and
he
could
have
told
her,
i
suppose,
he
could
have
volunteered
to
her,
now
bear
in
mind
that
the
death
penalty
is
at
issue
here
because
the
judge
told
me
that;
and
i
was
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
the
time
he
told
me.
he
could
have
volunteered
that
to
her,
i
assume?
justice
scalia
probably
should
have,
if,
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
the
point.
justice
scalia
general
echohawk,
i
don't,
i
don't
understand.
that
language
is
not
inconsistent
with
anything
that
you
have
told
us
anyway,
right?
if
that
language
is
accepted
as
entirely
true,
all
it
proves
is
that
the
state
must
make
known
its
intent
to
seek
the
death
penalty
or
not.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
at
all
say
that
once
the
state
does
make
known
its
intent
not
to
seek
the
death
penalty,
the
death
penalty
can't
be
imposed.
so
that
was
complied
with
here
anyway,
even
if
you
accept
that
language
as
supplementing
the
statute.
it
was
complied
with
in
this
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
know
that
we
were
arguing
about
whether
this
was
a
death
case
or
not.
is
that
really
what's
at
issue?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
understand
her
brief
to
say
that.
because
if
that
is
the
case,
then,
then
there
would
follow
the
rule
about
the
polygraph
would
change,
but
there
would
also
follow
a
lot
of
other
things,
including
the
fact
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
a
special
separate
sentencing
hearing
anyway.
well,
is
that
true?
i
thought
you
had
a
separate
sentencing
hearing
anyway.
even
if
it
had
not
been
death
in
the
wind,
there
still
would
have
had
to
have
been
a
separate
sentencing
hearing,
wouldn't
there?
justice
scalia
before
you
sit
down,
general,
when
was
the
notice...
was
the
notice
given
to
the
court
of
the,
of
the
sentence
that
the
prosecution
was
seeking
before
or
after
the
presentence
investigation?
what
is
the
order
of
that?
did
the
presentence
investigation
precede
or
follow
the
prosecution's
recommendation?
justice
scalia
well,
the
order
is
may
17,
at
page
22
of
the
appendix,
and
it
sets
the
presentence
investigation
report
to
be
filed
on
june
14.
justice
scalia
so
that
was
after
the
presentence
investigation
was
completed
and
filed,
then?
justice
scalia
well,
now,
it's
not
as
though
anything
that
was
done
by
the
prosecutor
or
the
trial
court
contradicted
the
statute.
i
mean,
it
isn't
as
though...
you
didn't
receive
any
assurance,
did
you,
affirmative
assurance
that
the
death
penalty
was
not
at
issue?
justice
scalia
the
court
order
said
what?
said
that
the
prosecution
was
not
seeking
the
death
penalty?
justice
scalia
all
right.
they
ordered
the--
justice
scalia
ms.
fisher,
could
i
ask
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
you're
asking
us
to...
what
you
think
the
trial
court
had
to
say
was
not
merely
to
clarify
for
you
that
legally
he
could
impose
the
death
penalty
despite
the
state's
recommendation,
but
as
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
you
want
him
to
say
not
merely
i
legally
can,
but
i
am
considering
the
death
penalty.
you--
justice
scalia
--a
live
consideration,
not
just
that
legally
i
may
do
it.
you,
you
want
him
to
affirmatively
let
counsel
knowing
that
i
am
still
thinking
about
that
because
i
think
it's
a
possibility
here.
that's
what
you're
asking?
justice
scalia
why
did
he
have
to
do
that?
isn't
it
enough
if
the
law
is
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
grant
that.
why
wouldn't
it
be
enough
for
him
to
say,
i
want
you
to
know,
i'm
not
telling
you
what
i'm
thinking
about
because
i
haven't
thought
about
it
yet,
i
want
to
leave
my
mind
open
to
all
the
arguments
first.
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
may
legally
impose
the
death
penalty.
would
that
be
enough?
