justice
kennedy
so
then
it's
not
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
can
in
effect
waive
the
death
penalty,
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
you
had
notice.
isn't
that
true?
justice
kennedy
and...
in
that
respect
i'm
concerned
that,
unless
i
misread
the
record,
you
indicate
nothing
in
your
briefs
and
nothing
in
the
trial
court
to
indicate
that
you
would
have
done
anything
any
differently,
nor
did
you
express
any
surprise
or
make
any
objection
when
the
penalty
was
imposed,
but
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
kennedy
well,
has
there
been
any
showing
of
that
in
this
record?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
knew
those
aggravating
factors
were
at
issue
with
reference
to
the
length
of
the
prison
sentence.
i
would
assume
that
if
you
had
something
that
was
important
in
mitigation
you
would
have
brought
it
up
in
connection
with
the,
the
sen...
the
hearing
on
the
length
of
the
prison
sentence.
justice
kennedy
well,
you're
telling
us
that
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
an
appropriate
argument
for
us
to
take
into
account
when
you
did
not
make
that
submission
at
any
point
below
or
in
your
briefs.
ms.
fisher,
this
was
a
capital
case.
i
mean--
--justice
kennedy
asked
her
a
question,
i
think.
justice
kennedy
where
did
you
advise...
in
the
record
does
it
show
that
you
have
advised
the
trial
court
of
that?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
can
return
to
it
later
if
you
wish.
i
think
it's
an
important
point.
justice
kennedy
well,
sometimes
counsel
don't
want
to
mention
the
most
frightening
possibility
for
their
case.
they
want
to
get
the
judge
thinking
in
another
direction.
it's
like
a
punitive
damages
cases.
all
you
want
to
talk
about
is
compensatory
damages.
the
less
said
about
punitive,
the
better,
just
in
order
to
have
a
context
within
which
it's
difficult
for
the
judge
to
make
that
decision.
so
you
could
interpret
this
record
as
a
tactical
decision
to
focus
on
the
determinate
sentences
simply
in
order
to
put
the
judge's
mind
in
that
frame.
justice
kennedy
did
idaho
law
permit
you
to
move
the
trial
court
to
reconsider
the
sentence?
justice
kennedy
you
mean
at
the
time
he
enters
a
sentence
in
the
trial
court
you
can't
ask
him
to
consider
whether
or
not
he
might
withdraw
that
determination--
justice
kennedy
--based
on
a
showing
that
you
were
surprised?
justice
kennedy
did
you
raise
it
at
one
of
those
two
points?
justice
kennedy
and
did
you
include...
at
which
point?
the
120-day
point?
justice
kennedy
did
you
include
in
there
an
affidavit
or
a
showing
or
an
allegation
that
you
had
been
surprised?
justice
kennedy
and
does
that
contain
an
enumeration
of
the
things
you
would
have
done
differently?
justice
kennedy
is
that
motion
and
those
proceedings,
are
they
in
that
record,
in
the
record?
justice
kennedy
well,
it's
something
more
than
that,
isn't
it?
the
order
of
may
17
directs
that
in
the
event
the
state
shall
seek
the
death
penalty,
it
shall
formally
file
with
the
court
a
statement
listing
the
aggravating
circumstances,
and
the
defendant
shall
specify
in
a
concise
manner
all
the
mitigating
factors.
is
it...
would
it
be
a
reasonable
construction
of
that
order
to
conclude
that
when
the
submission
has
not
been
made
by
either
counsel
that
the
court
will
not
consider
the
death
penalty?
is
that
a
reasonable
construction?
justice
kennedy
so
you,
you
interpret
this
order
as
saying
that
the...
could
the
state
have
argued
for
the
death
penalty
after
failing
to
make
this
file?
justice
kennedy
despite
noncompliance
with
the
court's
order
of
may
17?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
whatever
its
genesis,
it's
a
court
order,
and
each
side
is
ordered
to
set
forth
the
aggravating
or
mitigating
circumstances,
as
the
case
may
be.
and
when
this
isn't
done,
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
might
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
that
the
death
penalty
may
not
be
considered
absent
these
filings.
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
judge
said
the
death
penalty
is
not
going
to
be
part
of
my
consideration,
then
he
changes
his
mind
after
the
arguments.
would
that
be
proper?
justice
kennedy
i
know
that's
not
the
case.
what
if
it
were
the
case?
justice
kennedy
i'm
testing
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
can
take
any
action
which
misleads
counsel.
justice
kennedy
so
there
was
nothing
about
this
hearing,
per
se,
that
would
indicate
that
it's
a
death
penalty
hearing?
the
same
hearing
would
have
been
held
even
if
it
were
just
a
question
of
what
the
sentence
should
be,
anything
from
a
determinate
number
of
years
to
life?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
so
far
as
all
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
arguments,
those
same
evidence
and
same
arguments
would
routinely
have
been
presented
in
idaho
even
if
death
had
not
been
one
of
the
options?
