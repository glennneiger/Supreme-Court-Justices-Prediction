mr.
larry
echohawk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
what
we
have
here
today
is
a
claim
by
the
petitioner
that
he
was
totally
surprised
on
the
day
of
sentencing,
october
15,
1984,
when
he
received
the
death
penalty.
the
law
clearly
states
from
the
very
beginning
when
he
was
charged
with
first
degree
murder
that
the
sentencing
court
upon
conviction
would
have
two
options;
a
life
or
a
death
sentence.
the
record
is
replete
with
examples
of
how
the
defendant
was
aware
that
the
death
penalty
was
at
stake.
i
believe
the
claim
of
the
petitioner
turns
on
an
unfounded
assumption,
and
that
is
that
in
some
way
the
prosecutor,
by
making
a
recommendation
that
it
did
not
intend
to
seek
the
death
penalty,
could
bind
the
court
in
limiting
the
option
that
the
court
could
consider
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
and
there
is
virtually
no
case
law
or
statutory
authority
to
back
up
that
assumption.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--i
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner's
counsel
are
presumed
to
know
the
law.
the
law
speaks
for
itself.
and
under
idaho--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
prosecutor
gave
a
recommendation
in
good
conscience
to
the
court
that
the
death
penalty
was
not
appropriate;
but
under
idaho
law
it's
not
the
prosecutor's
job
to
decide
what
that
ultimate
sentence
will
be.
that's
reserved
to
the
court,
and
the
court
followed
the
idaho
statutory
proceedings
very
carefully.
what
you
have
in
this
case
is
a
argument
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
there
needed
to
be
some
kind
of
extraordinary
warning
or
signal
that
the
court
intended,
regardless
of
the
prosecutor's
recommendation,
to
consider
19-2515
and
to
consider
the
aggravating
factors
that
are
set
forth.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
and
i
believe
that--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
state
would
be
in
a
position
as
it
approached
to
change
its
recommendation.
mr.
larry
echohawk
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the,
the
order
that
the
court
released
in
may
was
as
a
result
of
a
hearing
that
was
held
on
april
5;
and
the
counsel
has,
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
argued
that
this
was
something
that
the
court
pretty
much
thought
up
on
its
own.
and
the
fact
is
that
it
came
as
a
request
from
the
defendant.
and
i
think
that
that
april
5--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor,
the
way
that
the
idaho
capital
punishment
law
is
structured,
it
is
very
clear
that
it
is
the
judge
who
makes
that
sentence.
and
the
law
in
idaho
is
also
very
clear
that
the
prosecutor
may
give
a
recommendation,
but
in
no
way
is
that
binding.
and
i
think
that
the
april--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--well,
that's
not
the
case
here,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
echohawk
well,
i
think
ultimately
the--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--well,
your
honor,
the
point
is
that
the
court
has
the
ultimate
decisionmaking
authority
on
the
sentence,
and
if
it
were
to
change
its
mind
and
some
way
give
a
false
signal
and
then
come
back
and
do,
do
something
else,
i
believe
that
the
counsel
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
make
the
argument.
but
here
the
court
gave
a
very
consistent
statement
all
the
way
through
the
proceedings
about
what
it
intended
to
do.
upon
the
request
of
defendant,
it's
true
the
court
did
ask
the
state
to
identify
whether
or
not
it
was
going
to
seek
the
death
penalty.
but
i
think
that,
this
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
i
think
that
the
court
ought
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
record
in
the
supreme
court,
the
transcript
from
the
april
5
proceeding,
because
in
that
proceeding
the
court
makes
this
statement
after
there
is
some
discussion
about
and
recognition
that
notification
by
the
state
is
not
required
as
to
its
position.
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
there
obviously
needs
to
be
inquiry
pursuant
to
19-2515
as
to
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
that
may
exist,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
state
intends
to
pursue
the
death
penalty.
i
think
the
court
made
it
pretty
clear
in
that
statement
that
yes,
we're
going
to
identify
what
the
prosecutor's
position
is,
but
the
court
has
an
independent
authority
here
in
the
sentencing
structure,
and
the
court
is
going
to
consider
19-2515
regardless
of
what
the
state's
position
may
be.
mr.
larry
echohawk
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
was
an
actual
proceeding
where
the--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor,
this,
this
language
that
i
quote
comes
out
of
a,
this
was
after
conviction,
just
5
days
after
the
conviction--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--yes,
in
this
case.
mr.
longeteig,
the
trial
counsel
for
bryan
lankford,
was
present.
the
prosecutor
was
present.
they
were
discussing
when
to
set
the
sentencing
date.
the
defendant's
counsel
asked
for
the
state
to
disclose
what
its
position
would
be.
the
court
says
yes,
i'll
do
that,
but
you
have
to
understand,
obviously
there
needs
to
be
an
inquiry
into
19-2515,
and
regardless
of
whether
the
state--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor,
ms.
fisher
was
not
counsel--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--she
did
not
enter
the
case
until--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor,
ms.
fisher
had
available
to
her
under
court
order
the
services
of
the
trial
attorney
right
up
through
sentencing--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--no,
your
honor.
the
defendant
was
personally
present.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
i
think
the--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--that's
the
transcript
of
the
april
5
hearing.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--he
could
have
volunteered
that
information.
counsel--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
echohawk
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
evidence
showed
that
the
person
that
actually
struck
the
deadly
blow
was
mark
lankford,
the
brother
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
judge,
judge's
findings
would
have
identified
that
this
was
a
common
scheme
to
commit
the
murderous
act.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
judge
thought
that
the
person
that
actually
delivered
the
deadly
blow
was
mark
lankford,
but
that
the--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
was
in
dispute
as
to
who
struck
the
deadly
blow.
but
the,
the
court
made
a
finding
that
this
defendant
intended
to
kill.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
i'd
have
to
go
back
and
read
that
specifically
to
see
if
there's,
you
know,
one
comment.
but
with
regard
to
the,
to
the
polygraph
that
counsel
for
petitioner
says
would
be,
would
have
been
helpful,
actually
i
believe
that
that
was
more
damaging
than
helpful.
there
were
essentially
10
questions
that
were
asked
through
two
polygraph
examinations;
and
six
of
those
the
defendant
was
found
to
be
deceptive.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
where
he
failed
is
where
he
identified
that
he
did
not
know
that
these
people
were
going
to
be
killed,
and
that
where
he
passed
was
where
he
identified
that
his
brother
was
the
one
that
actually
struck
the
blow.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
clearly
the
prosecutor
thought
that
bryan
lankford
was
the
less
culpable
of
the
two.
i
think
it's
important
when
we
talk
about
what
the
judge
was
thinking
to
recognize
that
in
idaho
there
is
a
very
specific
procedure
that
can
be
followed
if
you
want
to
bind
the
judge
to
a
sentencing
alternative.
that's
what
we
call
rule
11.
and
if...
counsel
may
have
had
a
pretty
good
argument
to
make
if
at
the
time
that
she
handled
the
sentencing
proceeding
she
walked
into
the
courtroom
with
a
rule
11
plea
in
hand
that
really
does
bind
the
judge.
but
in
this
case
that
was
not
the
situation.
the
judge,
in
fact,
at
the
close
of
the
sentencing
argument
noted
that
the
death
penalty
was
an
option,
and
that
he
was
rejecting
the
prosecutor's
recommendation.
now
at
that
point
the
defense
attorney
objects
because
she
said
i
want
him
to
be
sentenced
today.
if
she
really
thought
that
it
was
a
surprise,
believe
me,
i
believe
she
would
have
gone
right
through
the
ceiling
and
asked
for
more
time,
asked
for
a
rehearing,
reconsideration.
that
just
didn't
happen.
i
believe
that
it
was
really
a
matter
of
trial
strategy
on
her
part.
and
looking
at
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
benefitting
by
that
prosecutor's
recommendation
rather
than
being
harmed.
the
benefit
came
because
the
prosecutor
was
very
articulate
in
closing
argument
at
sentencing
identifying
that
in
his
opinion
the
defendant
was
the
less
culpable.
but
the
judge
is
the
one
that
has
to
make
that
ultimate
decision;
and
under
idaho
law
he
is
required
to
follow
a
step
by
step
procedure.
he
is
required
to
hold
a
sentencing
hearing.
he
is
required
to
review
the
evidence
that
is
submitted
at
trial.
he
had
5
days
worth
of
evidence
that
he
had
to
consider.
and
he
is
also
required
to
consider
whatever
mitigation
or
aggravation
factors
are
presented.
in
this
case
the
state
presented
no
additional
aggravating
factors.
the
defendant
called
seven
mitigating
witnesses.
and
i
assert,
your
honors,
that
the
evidence
that
came
in
at
sentencing
hearing
applies
whether
you're
talking
about
a
life
term
with
no
possibility
of
parole
or
a
death
sentence.
the
information
that
was
presented
to
the
court
is
mitigating,
period.
and
the
court
considered
that
and
made
written
findings.
i
think--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--justice
souter,
i
believe
that
this
court
should
place
no
significant,
significance
to
that
language
because
that
was
not
at
issue.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
that
was
not
the
issue
in
the
case.
the
court
simply
made
the
statement
that
the
mandated
provisions
under
idaho
law
were
followed,
and
then
went
down
and
listed
several
that
had
been,
several
of
the
procedures
that
had
been
followed
by
the
court,
including
notification.
but
there
is
no
place
in
the
idaho
statute
or
no
other
case
where
it's
identified
that
the
state
is
required
to
give
that
notification.
in
fact,
the
first
major
supreme
court
case
in
idaho
to
interpret
19-2515,
state
v.
osborn,
held
just
the
opposite;
where
the
prosecutor
did
not
make
a
recommendation
for
death,
the
death
penalty
was
imposed,
and
the
court
considered
whether
or
not
there
was
some
requirement
that
the
state
should
notify
the
defendant.
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
requirement.
mr.
larry
echohawk
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
echohawk
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
the
way
that
the
idaho
sentencing
laws
for
capital
offenses
are
structured,
the
judge
is
placed
in
a
position
to
make
that
decision
to
avoid
inconsistencies.
and
to
allow
a
prosecutor
to
bind
the
judge
is
a
way
that
will
probably
lead
to
more
inconsistencies
in
terms
of
what
is
handed
down.
the
judge
is
the
ultimate
authority.
the
judge
is
given
10
aggravating
factors;
that
you
have
to
examine,
you
have
to
find
at
least
one
of
those
to
be
present
before
the
court
can
impose
a
death
penalty,
and
that
that
aggravating
factor
or
factors,
whichever
are
found,
have
to
be
weighed
with
the
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
larry
echohawk
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
what
a
judge
has
to
do
is
examine
independently--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--that's
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it's
important
to
note
that
at
no
time
has
the
defendant
in
this
case
made
any
factual
representation
about
what
evidence
would
be
available
to
specifically
address
the
death
penalty
that
was
not
presented--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
polygraph
evidence
would
have
presented
an
issue
for
the
trial
court
to
consider,
but
the
fact
is
that
she
did
not
offer
that
proof.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
i
believe
that
my
assertion
today
is
that,
that
evidence
would
have
made,
she
has
made
no
showing
that
the
evidence,
the
outcome
would
be
any
different
from
anything
that
she
could
have
produced.
mr.
larry
echohawk
well,
your
honor,
i
think
she
was
clearly--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor,
i
understand
that
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
once
the
prosecutor
made
the
recommendation,
that
it
became
a
nondeath
case,
that
the
prosecutor
could
bind
the
court
unless
the
court
came
out
and
made
some
specific
statement
that
i'm
going
to
ignore
what
the
prosecutor's
recommendation
is.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
death
was
in
the
wind
all
the
way
through--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--your
honor,
the
petitioner
knew
that
the
judge--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--yes.
mr.
larry
echohawk
yes,
your
honor,
in
all
cases,
whether
it
be
capital
or
noncapital,
the
defense
can
call
mitigation
witnesses.
mr.
larry
echohawk
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
echohawk
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
echohawk
i
think,
your
honor,
it
was
very
clear
that
this
was
a
capital
sentencing.
mr.
larry
echohawk
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
any,
the
problems
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
basically
speak
to
are
greatly
related
to
the
fact
that
she
did
not
become
counsel
until
september
20,
and
then
after
she
became
cocounsel
moved
to
discharge
a
trial
counsel.
and
this
is
something
that
the
defendant
brought
upon
himself.
the
judge
made
it
very
clear
from
the
beginning
that
he
would
have
problems
with
continuing
the
hearing
because
witnesses
were
under
subpoena,
and
the
case
had
already
been,
had
been
tried
actually
back
in
march,
and
this
was
an
october
sentencing.
i
believe
that
to
a
great
extent
any
problems
that
exist
have
to
be
laid
at
the
doorstep
of
the
defendant
himself.
throughout
this
sentencing
proceeding
trial
counsel
was
available.
trial
counsel
knew,
and
admitted
it
through
testimony
given
at
a
motion
for
new
trial,
that
the
death
penalty
was
at
stake.
and
in
fact
during
one
question
and
answer
period
when
ms.
fisher
questioned
mr.
longeteig
on
the
point,
the
comment
was
made,
mr.
longeteig,
did
you
understand
that
death
was
a
possibility
here,
or
an
option,
and
he
said
yes,
i
read
the
statute.
and
that's
essentially
what
our
position
is,
that
in
reading
the
statute
for
first
degree
murder
and
the
punishment
provisions,
it's
very
clear
that
death
was
an
option
and
that
a
sentencing
judge
would
be
called
upon
to
follow
the
provisions
of
19-2515.
and
that
the
prosecutor
could
not
in
any
way
alter
the
course
of
that
proceeding
by
a
recommendation.
his
recommendation
was
merely
advisory.
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
where
the
judge
was
required
also
to
take
the
evidence
that
was
produced
at
trial
and
apply
it
to
the
standards
in
19-2515,
essentially
providing,
applying
known
facts
to
a
known
procedure
in
the
capital
sentencing
process.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
i
don't
recall
the
date
that
the
presentence
investigation
was
filed.
the,
the
court--
mr.
larry
echohawk
--there
was
a
subsequent
order
in
early
september
dealing
with
notice,
and
the
prosecutor
actually
filed
his
notice,
or,
of
intent
not
to
seek
the
death
penalty,
i
believe
that
was
on
september
13.
mr.
larry
echohawk
i
think
perhaps
you
have
both
sides
covered,
both
before
and
after.
mr.
larry
echohawk
your
honor,
i
believe
there
was
an
addendum
to
the
presentence
investigation
that
addressed
that.
