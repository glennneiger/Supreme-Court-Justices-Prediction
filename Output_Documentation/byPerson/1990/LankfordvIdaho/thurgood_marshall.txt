justice
marshall
ms.
fisher,
when
was
the
first
time
that
the
judge
made
it
known
that
death
was
still
in
the
case?
you
have
mentioned
before
that
he
did
it;
was
that
the
first
time?
justice
marshall
do
you
consider--
--what
do
you
make
of
the--
--do
you
consider
it
fair
play?
justice
marshall
yes
or
no?
justice
marshall
and
you
believe
that
if
that
grew
up
to
be
a
practice
it
would
be
legitimate
all
over
the
country
if
we
say
so?
justice
marshall
and
doesn't
the
law
speak
that
prosecutors
shall
tell
the
truth?
justice
marshall
or
would
you
like
to
see
it
be
the
law?
