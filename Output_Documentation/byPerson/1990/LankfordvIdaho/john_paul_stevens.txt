justice
stevens
well,
was
the
present
counsel
for
the
defendant
counsel
at
that
time?
justice
stevens
was
she
in
the
room
when
this
happened?
justice
stevens
was
the
record
of
this
colloquy
that
you
describe
provided
to
her
at
any
time?
justice
stevens
so
she
could
have
asked
him
about
it
and
found
out
by
making
the
appropriate
inquiry,
but
she
didn't
hear
it
said
herself?
justice
stevens
and
that's
what
you
regard
as
the
best
example
of
advance
notice?
justice
stevens
this
also
was
before
the
order
requiring
the
prosecutor
to
take
a
position,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
something?
reading
the
trial
judge's
findings,
is
it
clear
from
the
record
whether
the
judge
thought
this
defendant
or
this
defendant's
brother
did
the
actual
killing?
justice
stevens
the
brother.
but
can
you
tell
that
from
the
judge's
findings?
the
judge's
findings
are
really
quite
ambiguous
on
who
did
the
actual
killing,
as
i
read
them.
justice
stevens
no,
but
my
question
is
can
you
tell
from
the
judge's
findings
which
person
the
judge
thought
actually
did
the
killing?
justice
stevens
how
do,
how
do
we
know
that?
how
do
we
know
that?
his
findings
don't
reveal
that,
do
they?
justice
stevens
and
isn't
it
a
fact
that
had
he
had
the
results
of
the
polygraph
examination,
which
apparently
were
part
of
the
attempt
to
work
out
a
plea
bargain
before
this
defendant
testified
at
his
brother's
trial,
those
would
have
shown
who
did
the
actual
killing?
justice
stevens
but
there
is
no...
you
cannot
tell
from
the
judge's
findings
who
did
the
actual
killing,
can
you?
justice
stevens
that's
right,
but
on
the
questions
that
related
to
who
did
the
killing
and
which
were
the
basis
for
the
prosecutor
being
willing
to
make
a
plea
bargain,
he
was
truthful
on
those.
is
that
not
right?
justice
stevens
which
is
the
fact
that
was
material
to
the
prosecution
when
it
negotiated,
when
it
negotiated
the
plea
bargain
that
the
judge
refused.
justice
stevens
well,
but
counsel,
your
opponent
did
that
today.
she
said
that
she
would
have
argued
that
even
though
polygraph
at
testimony
is
not
admissible
in
a
normal
trial
or
a
normal
sentencing
hearing,
she
would
have
argued
in
view
of
our
lockett
case
and
the
requirement
of
all
mitigating
circumstances
being
admissible,
she
would
have
argued
that
under
that
rule
it
was
admissible.
she
might
not
have
prevailed,
but
she
said
she
would
have
made
that
argument.
justice
stevens
well,
right.
and
she
said
the
reason
she
didn't
do
it
is
because
she
thought
it
was
inadmissible
because
she
didn't
think
it
was
a
death
case.
whereas
she
would
have
made
the
different
argument
had
she
realized
it
was
a
death
case.
and
you
say,
basically,
well,
she
should
have
realized
it.
that's
what,
it
kind
of
boils
down
to
that,
i
think.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
pretty
hard
for
her
to
make
that
showing.
how
does
she
know
what
the
judge
would
have
done?
but
it
does
seem
to
me
rather
strange
that
the
judge,
on
the
very
point
that
would
have
been
involved
in
that
testimony,
makes
such
an
ambiguous
statement
of
findings
in
his
explanation
of
the
death
sentence.
is
your
opponent
saying
that
this
wasn't
a
death
case?
i
mean,
if
it
wasn't...
if
the
effect
of
not
giving
the
notice
that
death
was
still
at
issue
was
not
to
make
it
a
death
case,
then
presumably
she
didn't
even
think
that
you
had
to
go
through
the
separate
sentencing
phase
at
all.
was
there
any
indication
of
that
in
the
record?
justice
stevens
no,
but
even
if
it
hadn't
been.
had
it
not
been,
just
for,
to
take
her
assumption
for
a
hypothetical,
you
still
would
have
had
this
very
same
hearing,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stevens
can't
you
answer
my
question?
even
if
the
judge
had
agreed
that
he
was
not
going
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
would
he
not
have
held
the
same
hearing
he
did
in
fact
hold?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
the
same
question
in
another
way.
did
the
presentence
investigation
report
refer
to
the
fact
that
during
the
interval,
there
was
a
fairly
long
continuance,
as
i
remember
it,
that
the
defendant
had
testified
at
his
brother's
trial
pursuant
to
the
prosecution's
request?
was
that
in
the
presentence
report?
justice
stevens
that
addressed
that
cooperation,
yeah.
thank
you,
general
echohawk.
ms.
fisher,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
9
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
first
of
these
two
cases,
lankford
against
idaho,
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
idaho
supreme
court.
that
court,
by
a
vote
of
three-to-two,
upheld
a
death
sentence
imposed
on
petitioner.
he
had
been
tried
by
a
jury
and
convicted
of
first
degree
murder,
a
capital
offense
under
idaho
law.
his
sentencing
hearing
was
conducted
by
the
trial
judge
some
eight
months
after
the
conviction.
several
weeks
in
advance
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
at
petitioner's
request,
the
trial
judge
entered
an
order
requiring
the
state
to
notify
the
court
and
the
petitioner
whether
it
would
seek
the
death
penalty.
the
state
filed
a
formal
response
saying
that
it
would
not
recommend
the
death
penalty.
although
petitioner
had
been
advised
at
his
arraignment
that
if
convicted
he
would
be
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
under
idaho
law.
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
petitioner's
counsel
presumably
in
reliance
of
the
state's
response
to
the
trial
court's
order,
made
no
argument
whatsoever
concerning
the
permissibility
or
appropriateness
of
a
capital
sentence.
both
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
merely
debated
the
length
of
an
appropriate
sentence
of
imprisonment.
several
days
later,
the
judge
reconvened
petitioner's
sentencing
hearing,
read
his
written
findings,
and
sentenced
him
to
death.
the
question
that
we
decide
today
is
whether
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
hearing
petitioner
and
his
counsel
had
adequate
notice
that
the
judge
might
sentence
him
to
death.
the
unique
history
of
this
case,
which
is
spelled
out
at
some
length
in
our
opinion,
persuades
us
that
the
notice
was
not
adequate.
the
pre-sentencing
order
entered
by
the
trial
court
requiring
the
state
to
advise
the
court
and
petitioner
whether
it
sought
the
death
penalty
was
somewhat
comparable
to
a
pre-trial
order
limiting
the
issues
to
be
tried.
the
purpose
of
such
order
is
to
eliminate
the
need
to
address
matters
that
are
not
in
dispute.
defense
counsel
reasonably
assumed
that
she
should
not
present
argument
or
evidence
directed
at
the
question
whether
the
death
penalty
was
either
appropriate
or
permissible.
if
defense
counsel
had
been
notified
that
the
trial
judge
was
contemplating
a
death
sentence,
there
are
legal
and
factual
arguments
that
she
presumably
would
have
made
but
did
not
make
because
she
reasonably
assumed
that
the
only
issue
concerning
the
length
of
petitioner's
incarceration.
the
trial
judge's
silence,
following
the
state's
response
to
the
pre-sentencing
order,
had
the
practical
effect
of
concealing
from
the
parties
the
principal
issue
to
be
decided
at
the
hearing.
the
lack
of
adequate
notice
that
the
judge
was
contemplating
the
death
penalty
created
an
impermissible
risk
that
the
adversary
process
may
have
malfunctioned
in
this
case.
accordingly,
we
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
white,
and
justice
souter
have
joined.
