ms.
joan
marie
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
petitioner,
bryan
stuart
lankford.
i
have
represented
bryan
lankford
since
september
20,
1984.
at
the
time
of
my
appointment,
which
was
as
cocounsel
pursuant
to
a
pro
se
motion
to
dismiss
his
trial
counsel,
bryan
lankford
stood
convicted
of
two
counts
of
first
degree
murder
due
to
his
participation
in
a
robbery
which
resulted
in
two
homicides.
one
week
prior
to
my
appointment,
namely
september
13,
1984,
the
state
of
idaho,
through
the
prosecuting
attorney,
had
writ...
had
filed
pursuant
to
a
court
order
a
written
affirmative
pleading
that
it
was
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
following
the...
my
appointment,
bryan...
and
because
of
the
notice
filed
by
the
state,
bryan
lankford
faced
a
maximum
penalty
at
sentencing
of
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
idaho
law,
especially
in
light
of
this
case.
however,
it
had
never
occurred
before
that
the
state
had
affirmatively
pled
a,
or
taken
the
death
penalty
out
of
the
sentencing
proceeding,
and
the
court
had
imposed
the
death
penalty.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
the
major
difference,
of
course,
or
the
critical
difference,
is
that
this
is
a
death
penalty
case
in
which
we--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--we
go
beyond
a
mere
recommendation
of
sentence
into
an
affirmative
pleading
that
they're
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
obviously,
capital
cases
or
capital
sentencing
proceedings
under
idaho
law
are
significantly
different
than
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
well,
state
v.
rossi,
if
it
was
before
the
litigation,
there's
two
things.
number
one,
if
it
was
entered
in
accordance
to
a
plea
agreement,
so
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty,
obviously
the
court
at
that
time
advised
the
defendant
they
were
not,
that
he
was
not
bound
by
the
state's
recommendation.
in
this
case
the
court
order
requiring
the
state
to
advise
the
defense
whether
or
not
they
were
seeking
the
death
penalty,
and
if
they
were
seeking
the
death
penalty
to
state
the
specific
statutory
aggravating
factors
upon
which
it
relied,
was
an
affirmative
notice
order
leading
the
def...
leaving
no
reason
for
the
court
to
have
ordered
that
notice
unless
the
state
could
have,
unless
the
defense
could
have
relied
on
it.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
the
court
could
have
done
that.
had
the
court
done
that
i
would
have
been--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
um...
insofar
to
the
first
ques...
the
first
portion
of
that
question,
yes,
things
would
have
been
done
differently
had
i
known
it
was
a
capital
proceeding.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
your
honor,
there
has
always
been
argument
that
i
would
have
treated
the
case
differently
because,
because
there
were
a
number
of
things
that
would
be
relevant,
a
certain
amount
of
evidence
that
could
have
been
marshaled
in
argument
that
went
directly
to
the
aggravating
factors,
but
i
didn't
know
that
the
aggravating
factors
were
at
issue.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
there
are
a
number
of
items
that
i
would
have
done
had
i
known
it
was
a
capital
sentencing
that
i
would
not
have
done,
and
did
not
do
because
it
was
a
noncapital
sentencing.
for
instance,
i
certainly
would
have
organized
my
time,
my
research,
and
my
energies
towards
the
sentencing
proceeding
and
not
gone
into
the
motion
for
new
trial.
i
would
have
listened
to
the
tapes.
i
would
have
developed
the
forensic
evidence
at
trial.
i
would
have
called
the
polygrapher
who
would
not
have,
whose
testimony
would
not
have
been
admissible
in
a
noncapital
case,
but
certainly
would
have
been
admissible
under
the
mitigating
circumstances
in
a
capital
case--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--i...
we
have
always
argued
that
there
were
things
that
i
would
have
done...
and
i
have
always
argued
that
there
were
things
that
i
would
have
done
had
i
known
it
was
a
capital
case.
at
the
postconviction
hearing,
which
was
the
first
available
time
which
i
could
raise
the
issue
of
notice,
i
said
i
wouldn't
have
done
it
this
way
as
a
result...
i
would
have
addressed,
i
would
have
developed
the
evidence
in
conjunction
with
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
at
trial.
i
indicated
that
the
effect
of
the
lack
of
notice
or
the
affirmative
misleading
of
the
notice
led
me
to
act
differently.
at
oral
argument
in
the
state
supreme
court
i
advised
the
state
supreme
court
that
there
was
a
number
of
things
that
i
would
have
done
differently.
so
this
is--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--i
believe
it's
in
the...
there's
an
excerpt
in
the
j.a.
on
the
postconviction
proceeding.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
the
argument
has
been
made,
certainly,
as
to
specific
things
that
i
would
have
done
differently,
they
have
been
argued...
it
has
not
been
argued.
it
has
been
argued
in
general
terms
because
no
one
has
ever
asked.
when
the
idaho
supreme
court
asked,
i
did
in
fact
refer
to
specific
things
that
would
have
been
done
differently.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
it
was
a
nondeath
case.
we
were...
this
proceeding--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--yes,
your
honor.
in
the
presentence...
it's
a
polygrapher,
i'm
sorry.
the
polygraphist.
the
trial
court,
there
was
a
reference
to
a
polygraph
in
the
presentence
investigation.
i
attempted
to
correct
it
because
the
reference
in
the
presentence
investigation
was
incorrect,
and
the
trial
court
advised
me
that
it
was
not
admissible.
i
acquiesced
in
the
fact
that
the
results
of
the
polygraph
were
not
admissible
because
it
was
a
noncapital
proceeding.
had
i
known
it
was
a
capital
proceeding,
i
would
not
have
acquiesced
in
that
inadmissibility.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
well,
the
issue,
the
issues
to
which
the
polygraph
had
been,
had
been
given
were
specifically
in
reference
to
those
issues
that
arise
under
the
statutory
aggravating
factors.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
they
are
relevant.
but
the
admission
of
the
polygraph
is
not...
well,
it
was
my
understanding
of
the
law
and
it
was
the
court's
understanding
of
the
law
that
in
a,
that
polygraphs
were
not
admissible.
had
i
known
it
was
a
capital
sentencing,
i
would
not
have
agreed
to
that
interpretation
of
the
law
because
of
the
broad
rulings
that
this
court
has
given
in
that
all
mitigation
evidence
can
come
before
the
trial
court
in
a
capital
sentencing
hearing.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
that's
correct.
certainly
polygraphs
have
been
held
inadmissible
in
other,
in
noncapital
sentencings.
but
certainly
a
major
difference,
or
what
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
in
this
case
was
the
ability
to
argue
against
the
appropriateness
of
the
death
penalty.
for
3
weeks
we
had
a
number
of
proceedings
in
the
court,
each
time
the
court
taking
some
significant
amount
of
effort
to
advise
the
defendant
of
the
matters
at
risk.
for
instance,
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
his
trial
counsel,
the
first
one
where
i
was
appointed
as
cocounsel,
he
discussed
the
risks
of
getting
new
counsel
at
this
stage.
he
does
not
mention
the
risk
of
the
death
penalty.
in,
on
march
10
when
we
had
the
hearing
to
dismiss
the
trial
counsel,
the
trial
judge
goes
into
significant
lengthy
colloquy
with
the
defendant
to
advise
him
of
the
risk
because
i
had
not
read
the
record,
because
i
had
not
been
present
at
the
prior
proceedings,
because
i
was
not
aware
of
everything
that
had
taken
place.
what
he
doesn't
advise
the
defendant,
and
what
he
doesn't
advise
me,
is
that
the
significant
risk
here
is
that
he
is
facing
the
death
penalty.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
at
the
conclusion,
after
all
of
the
evidence,
all
of
the
argument
and
evidence
was
heard
in
the
sentencing,
there
is
a
reference
by
the
trial
judge
to
"or
death".
taken
in
the
context
of
those
proceedings
and
taken
in
the
context
of
the
affirmative
notice
otherwise,
that
comment
was
not
regarded
as
a
statement
that
he
in
fact
was
considering
the
death
penalty,
but
rather
as
a
statement
to
the
prosecution
that
these
had
been
my
options,
and
you
come
in
here
and
recommend
the
minimum.
but
in
hindsight,
and
looking
at
the
cold
record--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--no
question
that
if
i
had
to
do
it
again,
i,
it
would
have
alerted
me.
whether
or
not
it
was
reasonable
at
that
time,
i
believe
in
the
context
of
the
proceedings
and
the
fact
that
we
had
gone
3
weeks
without
ever
mentioning
the
death
penalty...
there
are
two
times
prior
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
where
the
words
"or
death"
would
have
had
a
significant
impact,
would
certainly
have
alerted
me.
when
the
prosecutor
stands
up
and
says
well,
as
the
court
required,
we
filed
the
formal
pleading
waiving
the
death
penalty...
he
doesn't
say
specifically
waiving,
but
saying
that
we
weren't
seeking
the
death
penalty,
so
what
are
the
options
left,
indeterminate
life
or
determinate
life.
had
the
judge
interjected
there
"or
death",
that
would
have
alerted
me.
had,
when
i
stood
up
and
said
to
the
trial
judge,
the
question
that
i
have
to
argue
here
is
whether
or
not
this
court
should
impose
an
indeterminate
life
or
a
determinate
life
on
the
defendant,
had
the
judge
interjected
the
words
"or
death",
that
certainly
would
have
alerted
me.
but
if--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--well,
there
is
no
question
that
at
trial
counsel
where
they
received
affirmative
notice
from
the
state
that
they're
not
seeking
death
is
in
a
dilemma
as
to
whether
or
not
argue
against,
set
up
argument
as
to
the
potential
of
the
death
penalty.
and
as
the
case
law
now
is
in
idaho
because
of
this
case,
trial
counsel
are
in
that
dilemma.
at
the
time
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
death
penalty
was
at
issue.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
that's
correct.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
there
has
to
be...
there
has
to
be
a
distinction
between
a
recommendation...
i
obviously
knew
that
the
court
was
not
bound
by
the
recommendation
of
the
state.
the
state
recommended
the
minimum
of
10
years.
what
idaho
had
so
far
was
osborn
1.
osborn
1
said
that
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
has
no,
has
had
informal
notice
of
the
aggra...
evidence
in
aggravation
and
argument
to
be
had,
in
a
case
where
he
has
been
present
at
all
the
prior
proceedings,
in
a
case
where
the
trial
court
has
advised
him
at
the
time
of
his
plea
of
the
potential
of
the
death
penalty,
then
the
requirement
of
a
formal
notice
that
the
state
is
seeking
the
death
penalty
is
not
required.
osborn
2...
or,
gibson
then
comes
down
in
1983
and
refers
to
this
mandatory
procedure,
and
includes
the
notice
that
the
state
is
seeking
the
death
penalty.
osborn
2
then
comes
down
and
says
in
a
noncapital
sentencing
case,
even
though
clearly
osborn
was
a
first
degree
murder
conviction
where
the
state,
i
mean
where
the
court
imposed
life,
they
said
in
a
noncapital
sentencing,
idaho
code
2515(d),
which
is
the
necessity
of
inquiry
under
the
death
penalty
statute,
doesn't
apply.
so
there
wasn't
any
reason
to
believe,
in
1984,
that
if
the
state
didn't
seek
the
death
penalty,
that
the
court
would
impose
it
sui
sponte
without
any
comment
as
to
the
possibility
or
to
the
fact
that
he
was
in
fact
considering
that
option.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
well,
certainly...
you
know,
my
thoughts
are
not
in
the
record,
but
i
never
contemplated
the
possibility
that
the
judge
could
in
fact
impose
the
death
penalty
at--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--that's
correct.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
no,
it
did
not.
gibson...
and
the
reference
in
gibson
is
simply
a,
an
outline
of
the
capital,
the
mandatory
capital
procedure.
gibson
and
osborn
were
not
interrelated
in
any
way.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
well,
they
had
a
number
of
holdings
because
there
were
a
number
of
issues.
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
was
notice
in
gibson.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
assuming
that
you
accept
the
reference
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sentencing
hearing
as
such
notice,
that
would
have
been
the
first
time.
as
taken
in
the
context
of
proceedings,
the
first
time
that
the
judge
made
it
known
was
when
he
actually
imposed
the
death
penalty,
and
that
was
on
october
15,
1984.
in
this
case
there
is
more
than
a
lack
of
notice.
assuming
that
the
constructive
notice
of
the
statutory
requirement,
or
statutory
sentencing,
was
in
fact
constructive
notice,
once
the
trial
court
exercised
its
discretion,
which
it
clearly
had
under
idaho
sentencing
law,
to
notify,
or
to
order
notice
in
regard
to
the
issues
to
be
litigated,
the...
and
the
subsequent
court
compliance
with
the
order,
it
moved
beyond
a
lack
of
notice
into
an
affirmative
misleading
situation
where
the
defense
detrimentally
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
was
not
in
the
case.
as
a
consequence
bryan
lankford
stands
sentenced
to
death
under
procedures
that
were
not
reasonably
calculated
to
give
him
the
opportunity
to
defend
against
the
death
penalty.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
the
post...
because
of
the
post...
the
consolidation
statute
in
capital
cases,
the
first
opportunity
to
raise
that
issue
would
have
been
in
the
postconviction--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--the
motion--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--i...
the
motion...
there
is
a
rule
35
in
which
you
can
move
to
reduce
a
sentence.
and
that,
that
motion
is
a
one-time
motion
that
can
be,
could
have
been
made
at
the
time
of
bryan
lankford's
sentencing
either
within
40,
within
the
42
days
that
you
have
for
an
appeal
or
within
120
days
after
a
mandamus.
consequently,
and
because
of
the
consolidation
statute
where
i
was
required
by
law
to
raise
any
and
all
issues
within
60
days
of
the
imposition
of
death,
that
rule
35
was
exercised
after
the
mandamus.
if
you
understand
what
i
mean...
we
had,
in
idaho
we
have
two...
at
the
time
of
this
sentencing
there
was
an
opportunity
to
raise
a
motion
to
reduce
the
sentence
one
time.
you
could
only
raise
it
once.
we
could
have
raised
it
either
within
the
initial
period
of
appeal,
or
we
could
raise
it
within
120
days
after
the
affirmance--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--yes,
i
did,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
120
days
after
the
affirmance,
yes.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
yes.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
i
don't
believe
that
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
it...
you
know,
it
certainly
contains
the
argument
that
if
i
had
adequate...
if
there
was
adequate
notice
through
the
statute,
then
bryan
lankford,
then
the
flip
side
of
the
issue
was
that
i
had
not
presented
what
needed
to
be
presented
in
a
capital
case.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
the...
i
believe
it's
a
different
appeal,
because
we
also
appealed
that,
that
ruling.
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
thank
you,
chief
justice.
there
is
a
few
matters
in
which
the
state
has
spoken
to
that
i
would
like
to
address.
number
one
is
the
april
5th
hearing
in
which
the
defense
requested
notice.
i
think
if
you
look
at
that
transcript
there
is,
there
is
a
couple
of
things
that
you
have
to
remember.
first,
the
defense,
when
they
requested
it,
said,
whether
or
not
the
state
seeks
the
death
penalty
will
materially
alter
the
manner
in
which
we
approach
this,
this
case.
secondly,
the
prosecutor
indicated
his
intent
to
let
the
defense
know
in
an
early
manner
so
that
the
defense
would
have
plenty
of
time.
now
the
court
does,
following
that
colloquy
between
the
defense
attorney
and
the
trial,
the
prosecutor,
does
say
well,
regardless
of
the
notice
there
will
have
to
be
an
inquiry
under
2515.
however,
i
didn't
have
the
transcript.
i
asked
for
the
transcript.
and
mr.
echohawk
indicates
that
mr.
longeteig
was
available
to
me;
however,
the
record
will
reflect
that
the
trial
court
had
to
order
mr.
longeteig
to
stay
in
the
courtroom
at
my
beck
and
call.
the
transcript
of
mr.
longeteig's
testimony
at
postconviction
will
reflect
that
he
had
one
contact
with
me
from
the
date
of
my
appointment
on
september
20.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
not
be
bound...
no,
i
do
not,
chief
justice.
however,
what...
what
had
occurred
in
the
case
when
i
stepped
in
was
an
affirmative
court
ordered
notice
that
the
death
penalty
wasn't
at
issue.
what
had
never
been
litigated--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--how
did
i
know
that?
it
was
on
file.
it
was
filed
as
a
formal
pleading.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
no,
it
was
a
formal
pleading
indicating
that
the
state
was
not
recommending
the
death
penalty.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
well,
certainly
the
hearing--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--it's
reasonable
to
infer.
the
hearing
takes
place
on
april
5th.
certainly
the
court's
order--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--that's
correct.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
yes.
i
asked
for
it,
the
transcript
of
the
trial
and
all
prior
proceedings.
and
i
was
denied.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
denied.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
that's
correct,
justice
white.
i
asked
for
the
transcript.
he
said
well,
you've
got
the
preliminary
hearing
transcript
and
you've
got
the
transcript
of
your
client,
and
you
have
mr.
longeteig,
who
i
am
ordering
to
be
at
your
beck
and
call,
and
that's
all
you
need.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
he...
on
october
10
he
said
we
will
try
to
make
available
to
you
tapes
of
the
trial.
those
tapes
were
made
available
to
me
on
october
11.
certainly,
because
i
was
trying
to
get
ready
because
my
motion
for
continuance
of
the
sentencing
had
been
denied,
i
was
trying
to
get
my
witnesses
ready
for
the
sentencing,
and
i
also
had
to
represent
bryan
lankford
at
his
codefendant's
motion
for
new
trial,
so
i
was
unable
to
review
the
tapes.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
no.
it
was
only
the
tape
of
the
trial
itself.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
the
transcript
was
developed
during
the
postconviction
and
the
appellate
process
in
the
idaho
supreme
court.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
well,
it
was
typewritten.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
i
have,
i
have
no
idea,
justice
white.
i'm
sure
that
there
was
a
tape.
that
tape
was
not
made
available
to
me.
the
only
tapes
made
available
to
me
were
the
5-day
jury
trial.
mr.
echohawk
makes
remarks
that
my
surprise
was
never
litigated.
this
case
has
never
been
litigated
on
my
actual
knowledge.
certainly
when
i
filed
the
postconviction,
the
state
responded
that
this
was
a
legal
issue.
it
was
a
question
of
whether
the
statutory
notice
carried
through
and
negated
the
effect
of
any
affirmative
action
by
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor.
the
idaho
supreme
court
did
not
go
on
the
issue
of
actual
notice,
or
my
actual
knowledge.
it
has
never
been
litigated
because
it
has
never
been
raised.
the
question
is,
did
the
constructive
notice
of
the
statute
effectively
pass
through
that
affirmative
trial
court's
order?
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
the
court
order
says,
says...
well,
i
suppose
i
took
assurance
from
the
court
order
and
from
the
resulting
notice.
certainly
the
trial
court
never
said
to
me--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--that's
correct.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
they
ordered
the
prosecutor
to
say--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--that's
correct,
justice
white.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
that's
correct.
and
that's
the
bottom
line
here.
all
we,
all
that
the
trial
court
needed
to
do,
having
ordered
a
notice
which
appeared
to
have,
which
was
certainly
discretionary
and
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
do
under
the
general
sentencing
statute,
having
ordered
it,
having
received
the
formal
pleading
from
the
state,
all
the
court
had
to
do
was
somewhere
give
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
know
that
regardless
of
the
state's
order,
regardless
of
the
state's
filing
pursuant
to
the
order,
he
was
still
considering
the
death
penalty.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
these
were
his
first
two
death
cases.
he
had
not.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
there
have
been
a
number
of
first
degree
murder
cases.
there
are
currently
19
death,
people
sentenced
to
death
in
idaho.
it's
not
normal
procedure
for
the
state
to
affirmatively
order
the,
i
mean
for
the
court
to
affirmatively
order.
it
is
the
court
taking
the
unusual
action
under
its
general
discretionary
power
to
order
such
notice
as
the
court
may
require
that
changes
the
whole
structure
of
this
case.
had
the
state
simply
made
no
recommen...
or
simply
said
nothing
about
the
death
penalty
one
way
or
the
other,
then
we'd
be
in
an
osborn
situation.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
in
a
death
penalty
case?
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
not
generally.
in
this
case
the,
the
issues
were
defined
by
the
court's
order.
and
then
when
this--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--only
the
court
order
regarding
whether
the
state
was
seeking
the
death
penalty.
if
they
sought
the
death
penalty,
then
to,
you
know,
to
define
the
aggra...
statutory
aggravating
factors.
the
diffi--
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
--yes.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
that
the
death
penalty
is
still,
is
still
a
consideration,
yes,
justice.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
yes.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
the
law
is
not
clear.
it
was
not
clear
in
1984.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
that
would
have
been
enough.
ms.
joan
marie
fisher
thank
you.
