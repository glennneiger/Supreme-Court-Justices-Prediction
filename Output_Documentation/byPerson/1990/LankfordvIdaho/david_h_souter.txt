justice
souter
did
osborn
2
advert
specifically
to
gibson?
justice
souter
i
take
it
that
outline
was
not
the
holding
of
the
case
in
gibson,
however?
justice
souter
what
significance,
if
any,
should
we
put
in
the
language
quoted
on
page
45
of
the
opposing
brief
from
gibson
which
refers
to
the
procedures
which
they
are
claiming
should
have
been
followed
as
being
mandated
in
potential
death
penalty
cases?
justice
souter
but
just
to
be
clear
on
the
point,
what
you,
what
you
are
saying
in
effect
is
that
when
the
court
referred
to
a
potential
death
penalty
case
it
was
referring
to
a
case
in
which
at
any
time
capital
sentencing
was
a
possibility.
it
was
not
referring
to
these
as
conditions
upon
which
a
capital
sentence,
as
necessary
conditions
upon
which
a
capital
sentence
could
be
imposed.
in
other
words,
it
was
stating
a
description
of
a
generic
kind
of
case
rather
than
setting
out
a
procedural
condition.
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
souter
no,
i
realize
that.
i'm
just
going
back
to
the,
to
the
colloquy
that
you
and
i,
and
justice
scalia
and
i
have
had
about
the
language
from
gibson.
and
i
just
want
to
get
clear
on
this
that
when
gibson
refers
to
a
potential
death
penalty
case,
you
in
effect
are
telling
us
that
what
gibson
is
referring
to
is
a
case
in
which
at
any
time
the
death
penalty
might
have
been
or
might
indeed
be
a
possibility.
but
it
is
not,
the
court
was
not
by
that
language
referring
to
the
preceding
procedures
as
conditions
which
must
be
satisfied
before
a
death
penalty
can
be
imposed.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
souter
in
any
case,
i
take
it
from
what
you
say
that
you
would,
you
never
did
get
a
tape
of
the
hearing
that
we're
discussing
here.
