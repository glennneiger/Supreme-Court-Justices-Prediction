v.
idaho.
ms.
fisher.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
fisher,
you
say,
you
intimate
that
if
the
prosecution
doesn't
seek
the
death
penalty
under
idaho
law,
then
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
imposed
under
idaho
law.
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
idaho
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
ms.
fisher,
the
judge
did
say
that
one
possible
upshot
of
it
would
be
the
death
penalty,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
don't
you
think
that
had
you
to
do
it
again,
and
perhaps
any
lawyer
exercising
a
reasonable
judgment
in
that
situation,
when
the
judge
said
that,
it
would
have
alerted
them
if
they
hadn't
been
alerted
before?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
fisher.

chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
an
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
you
were
quoting
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
echohawk,
under
idaho
law
if
the
judge
is
debating
a
sentence,
there
is
no
possibility
of
death,
does
the
defendant
ordinarily,
is
the
defendant
ordinarily
allowed
to
call
a
number
of
mitigating
circumstance
witnesses?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
in
a
robbery
case,
say
where
the
maximum
is
20
years?
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
a
sentencing
hearing,
the
defendant
can
call
witnesses?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ms.
fisher,
do
you
think
you
can
just
take
the
case
stepping
into,
as
counselor,
as,
be
kind
of
a
tabula
rasa,
and
not
be
bound
by
anything
that
has
gone
before
in
the
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
fisher.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
