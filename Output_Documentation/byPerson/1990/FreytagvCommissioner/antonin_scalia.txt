plus
your
argument
here
is
at--
justice
scalia
--cross
purposes
with
your
argument
earlier--
justice
scalia
--your
argument
earlier.
i
mean,
well,
the
more...
the
more
authority
the
special
judge
has
the...
to
decide
the
case
conclusively,
the
less
likely
he's
just
an
employee
and
vice
versa.
the--
justice
scalia
mr.
roberts,
surely
what
matters
is
what
he
must
do,
not
what
he
may
do.
is
it
enough
to
say
that
he
may
decide
the
case
himself
if
he
wants
to?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me,
to
support
your
position,
you
have
to
say
he
must.
justice
scalia
i
know
all
this
is...
all
the
sentence
you
rely
on
just
says
he
may.
justice
scalia
whereas
the
last
sentence
says,
due
regard
shall
be
given
to
the
circumstance
of
the
special
trial
judge
had
the
opportunity
to
evaluate...
blah,
blah,
blah...
and
the
findings
of
fact
shall
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
justice
scalia
mr.
roberts--
justice
scalia
--at
a
minimum,
mr.
roberts,
"shall
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
"
means
that
if
everything
else
is
in
equipoise,
what
the...
what
the
special
trial
judge
found
prevails.
doesn't
it
mean
that
at
a
minimum?
justice
scalia
right.
i
see.
is
that
consistent
with
the
statute?
justice
scalia
he
in
effect
decides
the
case
then.
justice
scalia
if
what
he
says
goes.
justice
scalia
if
everything
else
is
in--
justice
scalia
what
does
it
mean...
due
regard
shall
be
given
to
the
circumstance
of
the
special
judge
have
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
the
credibility
of
witnesses?
justice
scalia
what
does
it
mean
to
give
due
regard
to
that?
doesn't
that
mean
that
you...
you
defer
to...
to
the
finding
of
fact?
justice
scalia
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
it's
meaningless,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
justice
scalia
i
see.
you
think
due
regard
means
no
regard?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
but
he's
not...
he's
not
going
to
interview
the
witnesses.
to
give
due
regard
to
that
individual's
ability
to
see
the
witnesses
is
to
defer
to
that...
to
that
individual's
judgment.
and
nobody
would
read
it
in
any
other
way.
justice
scalia
but
the
good
[inaudible],
which
their
rule
requires,
i'd
reverse
them,
too.
due
regard
means
due
regard,
not
no--
justice
scalia
i'm
trying
to
think,
mr.
roberts...
and
not
since
i've
been
here
anyway...
but
do
we
ever,
when
we
have
a
special
master
here
in
original
case
and
the
parties
don't
agree
with
the
disposition
of
the
special
master,
do
we
ever
adopt
the
decision
of
the
special
master
without
giving
a
hearing?
justice
scalia
i
think
we
don't.
justice
scalia
before
the
court.
