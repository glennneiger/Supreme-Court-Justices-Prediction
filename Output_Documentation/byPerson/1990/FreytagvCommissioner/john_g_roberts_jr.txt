mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
claim
that
the
appointment
of
a
special
trial
judge
to
hear
and
report
on
their
cases
which
is
authorized
by
the
plain
language
of
section
7443a(b)(4)
is
unconstitutional
under
the
appointments
clause.
there
are
two
reasons
that
this
court
should
not
reach
that
claim.
first,
petitioners
waived
it
by
consenting
to
have
their
cases
heard
by
a
special
trial
judge
in
the
tax
court
and
waiting
to
raise
their
claim
until
it
reached
the
court
of
appeals,
which
quite
properly
declined
to
consider
it.
second,
the
special
trial
judge
assigned
to
hear
and
report
on
petitioners'
cases
under
subsection
(b)(4)
performed
duties
that
may
be
performed
by
an
employee
and
do
not
require
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
the
appointments
clause
is
therefore
not
implicated
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
first,
the
waiver
point.
when
the
regular
tax
court
judge
became
too
ill
to
continue
hearing
petitioners'
cases,
the
chief
judge
did
not
simply
reassign
the
cases
to
a
special
trial
judge.
he
issued
an
order
proposing
such
a
reassignment
and
inviting
any
objections.
hearings
were
held
to
consider
objections.
petitioners,
represented
by
counsel,
discussed
with
the
chief
judge
the
issue
of
reassignment
and
settled
upon
terms
under
which
they
would
consent
to
the
reassignment.
one
taxpayer
did
object,
and
his
case
was
severed.
petitioners
never
did
object.
and
even
after
the
tax
court
decision,
in
two
motions
to
reconsider,
never
once
raised
the
appointments
clause
problem.
now,
the
reasons
for
a
waiver
rule
i
think
we've
seen
this
morning--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
petitioners
did
waive
that
argument
as
well
in
a
sense
that
they
did
not
raise
it
before
the
tax
court.
the
fifth
circuit
however
went
on
to
consider
it.
and
therefore,
under
the
rule
that
matters,
although
not
raised,
are
actually
decided...
may
be
reviewed,
we
agree
that
that
question
may
be
reviewed.
we
think
it's--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'll
do
so
right
now,
but
before
i
do
so
would
point
out
that
that
issue
is
a
very
good
indication
of
why
we
have
a
waiver
rule.
the
question
of
how
the
tax
court
interprets
its
rule
183,
how
a
regular
tax
court
judge
handles
the
report
of
a
special
trial
judge
when
he
gets
it,
are
all
matters
that
the
tax
court
could
have
definitively
resolved
if
it
had
been
asked
to
do
so.
instead,
because
of
petitioners'
default,
this
court
is
asked
to
decide
that...
those
questions
of
technical
tax
court
procedure
in
the
first
instance
and
in
a
decisional
vacuum.
now--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
petitioners
today
argue
that
rule
183(c)
prevents
the
tax
court
from
exercising
de
novo
review.
now,
if
that's
the
case,
they
should
have
known
that
when
the
chief
judge
proposed
to
reassign
their
case
to
a
special
trial
judge
for
hearing
a
report
under
rule
183(c).
the
rule
said
the
same
thing
then
as
it
does
today,
and
yet
they
raised
no
objection
at
that
point.
that
was
their
opportunity
to
do
so.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
do
so
also
after
the
decision
in
two
different
motions
to
rehear.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
decided
two
waiver
points.
one,
the
issue
they
permitted
petitioners
to
raise
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
or
not
this
type
of
a
case
can
be
assigned
under
subsection
(b)(4)
to
a
special
trial
judge
for
hearing
and
report.
petitioners'
argument
was
(b)(4),
which
says
any
other
proceeding
actually
means
any
other
small
proceeding
like
the
ones
in
(b)(1)...
(b)(1)
through
(3).
they
permitted
them
to
raise
the
issue.
so
that
one
is
not...
not
waived.
but
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
decide
petitioners'
constitutional
claim.
they
quite
properly
decided
that
that
was
waived.
now,
to
return,
justice
o'connor,
to
rule
183,
and
in
particular
(c).
there
is
a
last
sentence
to
the
rule,
but
there's
a
first
sentence
as
well.
the
first
sentence
describes
what
a
regular
tax
court
judge
is
to
do
with
the
special
trial
judge's
report.
and
it
says
he
may
adopt
it.
he
may
modify
it,
reject
it,
call
for
briefing,
call
for
oral
argument.
he
may
receive
additional
evidence
or
may
recommit
the
report
with
instructions.
that
in
our
mind
indicates,
as
section
743a(c)
makes
clear,
that
it
is
the
regular
tax
court
judge
and
not
the
special
tax
court
judge
who
decides
the
case.
that
reading
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
interaction
between
the
regular
tax
court
judge
and
the
special
trial
judge
is
a
matter
that
is
purely
internal
to
the
tax
court.
it...
petitioners
object
that
they
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
review
the
report
before
it
went
to
the
regular
judge.
they
didn't
have--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--he
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--he
must,
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
section--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
sentence
that
i
read
says
may
because
it
lists
a
number
of
things,
including
some
that
are
inconsistent
that
he
may
do.
he
may
adopt
it;
he
may
reject
it.
the
statute,
after
setting
forth
the
categories
of
cases
that
the
chief
judge
may
authorize
a
special
trial
judge
to
hear,
says
that
in
the
first
three
categories
the
chief
judge...
the
court
may
also
authorize
the
special
trial
judge
to
decide
the
case.
he
may--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
with
respect,
there
are
two
different
points
in
your
question.
there's
a
difference
i
believe
between
a
presumption
of
correctness
and
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
first
is.
the
rule
says
that
the
findings
of
fact
shall
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
the
rule
does
not
say
what
it
takes
to
overcome
the
presumption.
the
tax
court
has.
in
its
rosenbaum
decision,
it's
indicated
both
by
what
it
says...
said,
which
is
that
the
language
does...
in
no
impairs
or
dilute
their
responsibility,
and
by
what
it
did,
which
was
a
reweighing
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
in
many
instances
reaching
a
conclusion
different
from
that
of
the
special
trial
judge.
the
tax
court
has
indicated
that
it
reads
its
rule
as
proposing...
as...
the
presumption
is
in
effect
as
we
said
a
starting
point
from
which
the
tax...
the
regular
tax
court
judge
must
consider
the
proposed
findings
of
the
parties.
now,
as
i've
indicated...
given
the
fact
that
the
interaction
between
the
regular
tax
court
judge
and
the
special
trial
judge--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
they're,
of
course,
available
and
go
on
to
the
regular
judge
when
he's
reviewing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's...
if
it's
a
straight
tie,
then
that's
what
it...
that's
what
it
means.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
it
is,
because
i
don't
think
that
type
of
review
is
abdicating
responsibility
in
any
way
for
a
decision.
now,
of
course,
it
has
to
also
take
into
account--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
no--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
it
also
has
to
be
evaluated
with
the...
with
the...
the
burden
of
proof.
one
of
the
parties
bears
the
burden
of
proof.
and
if
that
party
has
not
carried
its
burden
of
proof,
if
it
is
an
exact
tie,
then
the
other
party
would
prevail.
now--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--certainly.
it's
just...
it's
just
reechoing
the
rule.
the
question
is
what
does
somebody--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
question
is
what
weight
is
given
the
presumption,
and
that's
not
a
uniform
rule.
presumed
correct
doesn't
necessarily
mean
the
same
thing
across
the
board.
it's
the
tax
court
rule.
the
place
you
look
to
find
out
what
the
presumption
means
is
the
ruling
of
the
tax
court.
and
that
court
has
indicated
that
the
presumption
is
not...
certainly
not
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
but
more
in
the
nature,
as
i
said,
of
a
starting
point.
and
again
to
get
back
to
the
relationship
between
the
regular
tax
court
judge
and
the
special
trial
judge,
it
is
internal.
petitioners
object,
we
never
had
a
chance
to
review
the
report.
we
never
had
a
chance
to
object
to
it.
and
they
say
that's
very
different
than
the
procedure
that
applies
with
respect
to
magistrates.
that's
our
point
exactly.
a
magistrate
decides
a
matter
that
he
is...
he
is
hearing...
a
civil
trial.
and
therefore,
the
parties
need
to
be
able
to
review
that
decision
to
determine
if
they
want
to
object
and
seek
further
review.
special
trial
judge
under
subsection
(b)(4)
decides
nothing,
and
therefore,
it's
perfectly
appropriate
that
there
is
no
opportunity
for
review
and
objection,
just
as
there
is
not
an
opportunity
for
a
party
to
review
and
object
to
a
law
clerk's
draft
that
is...
that
is
submitted
to
a
judge.
a
law
clerk
acts
as
an
aide
and
assistant
to
the
judge,
just
as
a
special
trial
judge
does
to
a
regular
judge
under
this
provision.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
in
the
district
court
it's
not
unusual
to
have
proposed
findings
submitted
to
a
court,
and
then
a
law
clerk
could
do
a
draft
of
those
and
submit
it
to
his
judge,
who
of
course
has
the
responsibility
for
decision.
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
may
well
be
meaningless
in
the
sense
that
the
regular
judge
always
the
retains
the
responsibility
to
decide
the
case.
due
regard
means
due
regard.
and
what
the
tax
court
has
said,
as
it
understands
its
rule,
that
this
in
no
way
dilutes
or
impairs--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--their
responsibility
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
think
due
regard
means
due
regard.
and
in...
and
in
the
case
of
credibility
determination,
the
regular
tax
court
judge
will
give
due
regard.
but
he
gives
regard
in
such
a
way,
as
the
tax
court
has
made
clear...
and
this
is
a
decision
for
the
tax
court
in
interpreting
its
rules...
does
not
impair
or
dilute
the
regular
judge's
responsibility
to
decide
the
matter.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
the
tax
court
has,
and
the
rosenbaum
decision
is
a
good
example.
there
they
went
through
and
overturned
findings
of
the
special
trial
judge
on
credibility
matters.
now,
they
were
reversed
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
stone
case
precisely
because
they
said,
you
didn't
give
enough
deference.
but--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--absolutely
not,
your
honor,
because
the
tax
court
has
not
acquiesced
in
the
stone
decision.
it
of
course
is
a
national
court,
and
it
said
the
stone
court
got
it
wrong.
we
don't
review
this
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
and
they
shortly
thereafter
changed
their
practice
so
that
it
is
now
purely
internal
and
confirms
the
relationship
between
the
regular
tax
court
judge
and
the
special
trial
judge.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
might
well,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
sense
that
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
is
closer...
the
statute
requires
that
the
regular
tax
court
judge
in
this
category
of
cases
make
the
decision.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
think
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
that
may
be
abdicating
too
much
of
his
statutory
responsibility.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's
a
presumption
of
the
sort
that
it
is
here,
as
the
tax
court
has
told
us...
essentially
that
means
that's
where
you
start...
now,
let
me
see
what
the
evidence
is,
let
me
review
the
matter...
then
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
statutory
language.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
case
has
evolved
somewhat
even
today.
if
petitioners'
objection
was
that
rule
183(c)
was
invalid,
it
seems
a
curious
way
to
proceed
in
raising
that
objection
to
raise
an
appointments
clause
problem.
if
a...
for
example,
by
analogy
if
a
district
court
judge
was
allowing
his
or
her
law
clerk
to
do
all
the
work
and
then
just
rubber-stamping
everything,
i
don't
think
our
first
reaction
would
be
that
that
violates
the
appointments
clause
because
the
law
clerk
hasn't
been
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate.
no.
we'd
say
that
what
the
district
court
is
doing
is
wrong.
and
the
way
you
correct
things
that
a
district
court
does
that
is
wrong
is
you
appeal.
now,
the
questions
presented--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
recognize
i'm...
as
treading
on
sensitive
grounds
but--
[laughter]
--if
the
presumption...
if
the
presumption
is
simply
that
this
is
a
starting
point
and
now
the
judge...
i'm
going
to
look
at
everything,
i
think
that
that
would
still
be
fine.
but
the
questions
presented
before
this
court
do
not
say
that
rule
183(c)
of
the
tax
court's
rules
is
invalid.
that's
not
subsumed
within...
within
the
questions
presented.
now,
what
a
special
trial...
tax
court
judge
does,
apart
from
hear...
submitting
the
report,
is
of
course
conduct...
preside
at
the
hearing.
his
duties
in
that
respect
are
in
no
instance
greater
than
the
duties
of
the
special
masters
that
this
court
regularly
and
routinely
appoints
in
cases.
we
know
that
those
special
masters
are
employees.
they
cannot
be
officers
of
the
united
states,
because
congress
has
not,
by
law,
vested
that
appointment
authority
in
this
court.
and
therefore,
by
analogy
the
special
trial
judge
is
also
an
employee
in...
when
he
performs
those
responsibilities.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
know
either
way,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
in
this
case,
of
course--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--before
the
court.
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
same
power
is
available
to
a
regular
judge.
he
can
call
for
oral
argument.
he
can
call
for
additional
evidence
which
is
a
feature
that
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
any
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review
that
i'm...
of
which
i'm
aware.
that
usually
is
restricted
to
the
record
before
the
reviewer.
here
he
can
call
for
additional
evidence,
if
he
needs
more
evidence.
and
he
can
just
send
it
back
and
say,
you
know,
try
again
and
start
over.
now,
the
special
trial
judges
have
other
duties
that
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
under
(b)(1)
through
(3)
they
may
be
authorized
to
decide
the
matter.
but
petitioners
cannot
rely
on
that
statutory
provision.
they
have
not
been
injured
by
any
assignment
under
(b)(1)
through
(3).
they
have
no
standing
to
object
to
that.
the
buckley
case,
buckley
v.
valeo,
makes
clear
that
in
considering
appointments
clause
challenges,
you
look
to
the
particular
duties
that
are
being
challenged.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
federal
elections
commission
was
improperly
constituted
under
the
appointments
clause.
but
it
also
said
that
the
fec
as
constituted
could
continue
to
perform
certain
of
its
responsibilities...
those
that
did
not
require
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
so
whether
or
not
an
officer
of
the
united
states
is
required
under
(b)(1)
through
(3),
it
is
not
required
under
(b)(4),
and
that
is
the
only
provision
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
on
the
waiver
point,
and
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
on
the
employee
point,
it
will
then
be
necessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
and
our
position
is
that
the
section
7443a(b)(4)
is
not
unconstitutional--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
the
duties
that
are
required...
that
require
an
officer
of
the
united
states...
an
officer
of
the
united
states
can
perform
duties
that
do
not
require
an
officer
that
may
be
performed
by
a
mere
employee.
and
that
is
the
case
certainly
we
think
with
respect
to
(b)(4)--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--does
not
require
an
officer...
and
therefore,
that
he
may
do
other
things
which
he
did
not
do
in
this
case
that
require
an
officer...
don't
give
them
standing
to
complain
about
those.
if
the
court
does
reach
the
constitutional
question,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
because
there
are
available
certainly
the
waiver
point
and
the
employee's
point...
and
the
constitutional
question
is
a
very
sensitive
one
that
goes
to
the
core
of
our
structure
of
government,
and
would
be
a
peculiarly
inappropriate
case
for
the
court
to
reach
out
and
decide
that
issue.
but
if
the
court
does
go
ahead
and
do
that,
we
believe
that
the
appointment
can
be
sustained
because
the
chief
judge
of
the
tax
court
is
the
head
of
a
department
in
the
executive
branch.
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
to
cite
the
case
again,
the
court,
referring
to
the
appointments
clause,
said
that
the
departments
referred
to
are
themselves
in
the
executive
branch
or
at
least
have
some
connection
with
that
branch.
as
the
second
circuit
recently
held
unanimously
in
the
samuels,
kramer
case,
the
tax
court
fits
within
that
definition.
we
know
it's
not
in
the
legislative
branch.
we
know
that
it's
not
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
honor,
each
case
has
to
be
considered
on--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--on
its
merits.
i
think
with
respect
to
the
territorial
courts
and
the
district
of
columbia
courts,
there
congress
is
acting
pursuant
to
its
authority
to
establish
local
governments.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
clause
may
not
apply
directly.
the
claims
court
is
a
particularly
unique
entity
because
it
may
well
be
an
adjunct
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit,
which
has
the
authority
to
remove
claims
court
judges.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
because
we
don't...
because
congress
in
those
instances
has
the
authority
to
establish
a
local
government,
and
a
local
government
that
need
not
comply
with
the
tripartite
separation
of
powers
in
the
federal
government.
those
entities...
it
may
difficult
to
classify
them
as
either
executive--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
i
think
in
that
instance
the
appoint...
when
the
federal
entity
is
doing
the
appointment,
the
appointments
clause
applies
with
full
force.
the
question
would
be
could
congress
authorize
the
territorial
court
in
a
territory
to
then
make
an
appointment.
and
i
think
there
because
the
territorial
court
may
well
be
equivalent
of
a
state
court,
a
local
entity,
the
appointments
clause
may
not
apply.
but
when
it's
the
federal
government
itself
making
the
appointment,
it
applies
in
full
force.
and
no,
the
congress
could
not
appoint
territorial
officials.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
does
apply
in
that
instance,
because
it
would
do
violence
to
the...
to
the
separation
of
powers
that
is
at
the
base
of
the
appointments
clause.
the
question
is
sort
of
the...
further
on
down
the
road,
is...
does
the
appointments
clause
apply
to
the
appointing
activities
of
the
territorial
entities.
and
because
i
think
they
may
well
be
creatures
that
don't
fit
into
the
tripartite
system,
because
they
partake
of
the
local
governing
authority,
that
the
clause
may
not
apply.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
congress
could
authorize
the
court
to
appoint
its
staff
even
though
we
may
have
trouble
saying
that
that's
an
executive
department
or
a
court
of
law.
but
i
think
when
congress
is
doing
the
appointing,
it
still
must
act
consistent
with
the
appointments
clause.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
an...
it's
an
interplay
between
the
appointments
clause
and
congress'
powers
with
respect
to
the
territories
and
the
district
of
columbia
which
gives
rise
to
creatures
that
are
hard
to
fit
into
the
terms
of
the
appointments
clause.
now--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
see
any
objection
to
that,
no.
i
think
they
could
have.
now,
if
the
tax
court
is
going
to
exist
as
a
constitutional
entity,
it
must
be
in
the
executive
branch,
because
there
are
only
three
branches.
petitioners
are
correct.
that
is
our
view.
and
we
know
that
it
is
not
in
the
legislative
branch,
and
it
is
not
an
article
iii
court.
they
say
that
it...
there
are
reasons
to
doubt
were
their
words
in
their
reply
brief...
that
it's
in
the
executive
branch
because
it
performs
adjudicatory
functions.
but
it
adjudicates
public
rights
cases
that
congress
may
leave
within
the
executive
under
murry's
lessee,
which
was
itself
a
tax
case.
now,
it's
easy,
of
course,
to
visualize
what
the
tax
court
does
as
being
adjudicatory.
it
looks,
acts
like
a
court.
but
it's
also
quite
simple,
as
is
the
case
in
all...
in
every
public
rights'
case
to
visualize
what
the
tax
court
does
as
being
purely
executive.
there
are
officials
in
the
internal
revenue
service
who
sit
down
and
decide
what
a
taxpayer
owes
the
government.
and
the
tax
court,
for
its
formality
and
separation,
is
really
another
level
of
that,
which--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
it
is
an
issue
of
first
impression
before--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--this
court
as
i
understand
it.
i
think
it's...
was
correctly
decided
that
way
by
the
second...
second
circuit
recently.
it
says
the
courts
of
law...
capital
c,
capital
l...
which
strikes
me
as...
that
naturally
refers
to
the
courts
of
law
established
under
the
constitution.
now,
petitioners
as
we
understand
it
do
not
dispute
that
the
tax
court
was
in
the
executive
branch
prior
to
1969.
the
question
becomes,
what
happened
in
1969
that
made
it
any
different?
congress
took
language
that
said
this
is
an
agency
in
the
executive
branch
and
substituted
language
saying
this
is
a
court
of
record
under
article
i.
we
agree
with
the
second
circuits
recent
decision
that
what
they
did
was
change
the
label.
they
didn't
purport
in
the
statute
to
move
the
tax
court
outside
the
executive
branch
and
didn't
purport
to
put
it
in
any
other
branch.
the
legislative
history
did
say...
not
the
statute,
the
legislative
history...
we
think
that
the
tax
court
should
be
considered
an
article
i
court
rather
than
an
executive
agency.
to
our
way
of
looking
at
it,
that's
like
saying
something
should
be
considered
an
orange
rather
than
a
fruit.
it's
both.
there...
the
article
i
court...
quite
happy
to
call
it
that...
but
it
remains
in
the
executive
branch.
and
we
think
that's
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
in
1969,
congress
continued
the
incumbent
tax
court
judges
in
office.
if
congress
were
doing
something
as
dramatic
as
moving
the
tax
court
out
of
the
executive
branch
and
placing
it
somewhere
else,
it
plainly
would
have
no
authority
to
continue
those
judges
in
office.
that
would
be
an
appointment
from
one
entity
to
another.
but
it
did
not
do
that.
it
continued
them,
and
quite
properly
so
because
it
was
not
moving
it
from
one
branch
to
another.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
may--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--those--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
they
may
or
may
not,
your
honor,
and
it
depends
on
an
evaluation
of
the
statute
in
'69
and
of
the
administrative
procedures
act.
congress
did
not
try
very
hard
to
prevent
that,
because
they
didn't
say
anything
about
that
in
the
statute.
if
they
don't
want
the
administrative
procedures
act
to
apply,
it's
an...
there
is
an
easy
way
to
reach
that
result.
the
administrative
procedure
act
now
defines
an
agency
not
to
include
courts
of
the
united
states.
it
would
be
a
simple...
maybe
not
simple...
but
a
pure
question
of
statutory
interpretation
whether
that
excluded
article
i
courts,
and
it
may
well.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
chief
judge
is
elected
by
the
regular
judges
on
a--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no
challenge
has
been
raised
to
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it
would
have
to
be
considered,
not
only
a
separate
office,
but
what
the
chief...
the...
the
attributes
of
the
chief
judge
that
are
different
from--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
chief
judge
is
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
the
question
is
is
the
difference
between
the
chief
judge
and
a
regular
judge,
does
that
require
a--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
is...
it
is
a
difference.
it
is
not,
as
i
say...
it
has
not
been
presented
or
briefed--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
clear.
it's
an
issue
that
has
not--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we
would
have
to
look
at
all
the
added
authority--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
one
question
would
be
is
whether
or
not
his
additional
authorities
are
such
as
require
a
separate
appointment.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
may
be,
for
example,
that
the
head
of
a
collegial
body
does
not
have
to
have
a
separate
appointment
particularly
here
where
the
collegial
body
acts
together
in
electing
him.
he
may
be
more
in
the
nature
of
a...
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
chairman
or...
or
a--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
he
is
clearly
the
head
of
this...
of
this
department.
there's
no
question
about
that.
he
doesn't--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it's
a
complicated
question...
answer,
but
perhaps...
and
i'm
thinking--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
suppose
the
question
of
the
chief
judge's
validity
is
avoided,
but
not
the
question
that's
before
this
court
today.
it
may
be
that
with
respect
to...
that
the
tax
court
as
a
whole
can
accept
the
appointment
authority
for
their
chief,
but
that
the
chief
judge,
once
appointed,
can
act
as
the
head
of
a
department.
in
other
words,
the
tax
court
as
a
whole
may
be
the
head
of
a
tax
court
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
the
chief
judge.
but
the
chief
judge
himself
then
is
the
head
of
the
department
for
things
that
only
he
can
do,
such
as
appoint
special
trial
judges.
