ms.
sullivan--
justice
o'connor
--did
the...
did
the
petitioners
here
agree
to
the
assignment
to
the
special
trial
judge?
yeah.
justice
o'connor
so,
your
answer
is,
yes,
there
was
consent.
justice
o'connor
i...
if
that's
the
situation,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
would
reach
any
problem
with
the
rule.
justice
o'connor
well,
have
we
really
gone
into
any
depth
in
defining
who
is
an
inferior
officer
and
who
is
an
employee?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
roberts,
i
guess
the
first
part
of
the
argument
here
today
went
to
the
statutory
argument,
and
as
to
that
it
was
asserted
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
the
argument
that
the
tax
courts
own
rules
are
improper.
justice
o'connor
so
that
question
is
before
us,
and
do
you...
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
part
(c)
of
the
rule
that
says
the
findings
of
fact
recommended
by
the
special
trial
judge
shall
be
presumed
to
be
correct?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
roberts,
just...
if
we
thought
that
the
last
sentence
of
that
rule
required
the
tax
court
division
to
which
the
report
is
assigned
to
give
the
special
trial
judge's
recommendations
a
presumption
that
they
are
correct...
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review...
now,
if
that...
if
that
is
our
reading
of
it,
is
that
consistent
with
the
authorizing
statute?
justice
o'connor
take
them
both.
justice
o'connor
is...
are
they
consistent
with
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
poberts,
to
get
back
to
my
question,
which
you
never
did
answer,
suppose
it
does
mean
it's
reviewed
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
would
that
violate
the
authorizing
statute
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
okay.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
it's
just
a
presumption?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it
absolutely
certain
and...
and
have...
has
this
court
ever
decided
that
the
term
courts
of
law
in
the
appointments
clause
is
of
necessity
the
same
as
an
article
iii
court?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
what
are--
--is
it--
--what
are
the
consequences
of
saying
it's
still
in
the
executive
branch?
does
that
mean
the
administrative
procedures
act
applies
and--
justice
o'connor
--the
freedom
of
information
act
and
so
forth
and
so
on?
justice
o'connor
all
the
things
congress
tried
very
hard
to
prevent.
