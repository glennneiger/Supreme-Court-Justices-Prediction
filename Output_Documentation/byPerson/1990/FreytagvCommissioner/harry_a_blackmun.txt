justice
blackmun
you're
going
to
tell
us
now
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
blackmun
what
if...
what
if
it
were
5
days?
justice
blackmun
well,
that...
that's
the
very
reason
why
i
wonder
why
you're
making
such
a
big
point
out
of
the
same
day.
justice
blackmun
the
first...
judge
sterrett
was
chief
judge.
justice
blackmun
he
knew
what
was
going
on.
justice
blackmun
he
must
have
known
what
was
going
on.
justice
blackmun
i'd
like
to
ask
him.
he's
present
in
the
courtroom--
[laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
is
an
important
case
for
those
concerned
with
governmental
structure
or
it
has
to
do
with
separation
of
powers,
but
perhaps
it
has
little
appeal
by
way
of
a
bench
announcement
for
those
who
are
not
so
interested.
the
litigation
centers
in
a
statute
that
authorizes
the
chief
judge
of
the
united
states
tax
court
to
appoint
special
trial
judges.
under
the
statute,
he
may
assign
to
them
certain
specified
matters
and
“any
other
proceeding
he
may
designate.”
and
as
to
the
latter
of
this
special
trial
judge
may
only
hear
the
case
and
prepare
the
proposed
findings
in
an
opinion
but
the
actual
decision
is
then
rendered
by
the
tax
court
judge.
the
petitioners
here
sought
re-determination
of
the
tax
court
of
approximately
one
and
a
half
billion
dollars
in
asserted
federal
income
tax
deficiencies.
there
are
cases
where
assigned
to
a
tax
court
judge
but
were
later
reassigned
to
a
special
trial
judge.
his
unfavorable
opinion
was
adapted
by
the
chief
judge
as
the
opinion
of
the
tax
court.
the
fifth
circuit
rejected
petitioner’s
arguments
that
the
assignment
of
a
complex
case
to
a
special
trial
judge
was
not
authorized
by
the
statute
and
that
the
assignment
violated
the
appointments
clause
of
the
constitution
which
limits
congressional
discretion
to
vest
the
appointment
of
so-called
inferior
officers
to
the
president,
the
heads
of
departments,
and
the
courts
of
law.
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
hold
hat
the
statute
authorizes
the
chief
judge
to
assign
any
tax
court
proceeding
regardless
of
complexity
or
amounted
controversy
to
a
special
trial
judge.
its
plain
language
which
contains
no
limiting
term
restricting
its
reach.
we
also
hold
that
the
statute
does
not
transgress
the
structure
of
separation
of
powers
embodied
in
the
appointments
clause.
such
power
can
be
vested
in
the
chief
judge
only
if
his
court
falls
within
one
of
the
three
repositories
that
the
clause
specifies.
congress
obviously
did
not
intend
to
create
or
to
grant
the
president
the
power
to
appoint
special
trial
judges,
and
the
term
department
refers
only
to
cabinet
level
departments.
an
article
one
court
such
as
the
tax
court,
however,
is
a
court
of
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
clause
and
that
is
the
answer
to
the
issue
in
the
case.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
is
joined
by
justice
o’connor,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
souter.
