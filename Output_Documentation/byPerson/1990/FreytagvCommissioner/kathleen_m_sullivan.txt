ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
tax
case
with
implications
for
up
to
3,000
taxpayers
and
a
billion
and
a
half
in
alleged
tax
deficiencies,
and
it
involved
one
of
the
longest
trials
below
in
the
tax
court's
history...
14
weeks
of
evidence,
complex
financial
testimony,
9,000
pages
of
transcripts,
3,000-plus
exhibits.
but
we
won't
tax
you
with
any
of
the
substantive
detail
of
that
tax
case,
because
the
sole
issue
before
this
court
is
the
authority
of
the
special
trial
judge
who
presided
over
and,
we
assert,
effectively
decided
the
case.
we
will
raise
issues
both
of
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
special
trial
judge.
but
i'd
like
to
start
of
course
with
the
statutory
claim,
because
should
you
reverse
this
case,
agreeing
with
our
statutory
claim,
you
would
avoid
the
need
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
now,
the
statutory
framework
that
governs
the
special
trial
judges
is
straightforward.
it's
set
forth
in
internal
revenue
code
7443a,
which
is
reprinted
at
a100
in
the
cert.
petition.
and
it
divides
the
work
of
the
tax
court
potentially
between
the
regularly
appointed
tax
court
judges,
who
now
number
19,
and
special
trial
judges
whom
congress
has
authorized
the
chief
judge
of
the
trial
court
to
appoint
and
to
remove
at
his
pleasure.
now
special
trial
judges
are
governed
by
7443a,
b,
and
c.
and
to
make
it
simple,
they
have
two
kinds
of
function.
the
special
trial
judges
may
hear
and
decide
certain
specified
kinds
of
tax
cases,
specially
specified
declaratory
judgment
claims
and
small
tax
claims
involving
amounts
under
$10,000.
they
may
hear
and
decide
those
cases
set
forth
in
7443a(b)(1)
to
(3).
(b)(4),
the
sole
provision
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
catch-all
provision
that
says
they
may
also
hear
but
not
decide
any
other
proceeding.
now
let
me
try
to
clarify
the
points
of
agreement
and
disagreement
between
petitioners
and
the
government
with
respect
to
the
statutory
claim.
petitioners
and
the
government
agree
completely
that
congress
did
not
authorize
special
trial
judges
to
decide
(b)(4)
cases.
(b)(4),
coupled
with
(c),
precludes
decision
by
a
special
trial
judge.
our
difference
with
the
government...
the
heart
of
our
statutory
claim...
is
that
in
this
case
he
did
decide--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
correct.
it--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that
may
be
right,
justice
kennedy.
that
is
not
what
the
tax
court
rules
permit.
so
our
argument
is
that
the
tax
court
rules
here
are
in
violation
of
the
statute
even
if
the
statute
is
properly
read
the
way
you
describe
to
permit
reports
by
special
trial
judges
subject
to
de
novo
review.
our
key
argument
here
under
the
statute
is
not
only
that
the
conduct
of
the
judge
below
here
amounted
effectively
to
a
decision
in
the
case,
but
that
the
tax
court
rules
ensure
that
special
trial
judges
will
effectively
decide
(b)(4)
cases.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
it...
precisely
how
we
read
the
rules
to
do
just
that.
the
tax
court
rules...
the
key
rule
here
is
rule
183.
and
we've
reprinted
that,
if
you
wish
to
look
at
it,
in
the
cert.
petition
appendix
at
a91.
now
the
key
features
of
that
rule
that
we
argue
preclude
what
justice
kennedy
said
might
be
permissible
within
the
statute
are
rules
(b)
and
(c).
specifically
i'd
like
to
start
with
(c),
if
i
might,
on
page
a92.
tax
court
rule
183(c),
which
is
the
governing
rule
in
(b)(4)
cases
and
was
the
rule
at
the
order--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--cert.
petition
appendix
a92.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
specifically,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph
(c)
on
a92.
you'll
see
in
that
sentence
that
the
action
on
the
report...
and
now
we're
talking
about
what
the
regular
tax
court
judge
to
whom
the
case
returns
after
the
special
trial
judge
has
finished
a
report.
if
you
look
at
183(c)
last
sentence,
it
provides...
last
clause
of
the
sentence...
that
the
findings
of
fact
recommended
by
the
special
trial
judge
shall
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
in
other
words,
the
tax
court's
own
rules,
justice
kennedy,
in
answer
to
your
question,
preclude
de
novo
review
of
the
kind
that
is
typical
in
other
settings
in
the
federal
government
where
adjunct
adjudicators
are
operating
under
the
real...
not
merely
formal...
supervision
of
a
regular
judge.
to
connect
up
to
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier,
had
magistrates'
decisions
in
suppression
hearings
not
been
reviewable
de
novo,
they
would
not
be
in
compliance
with
the
statute...
the
magistrates
act...
and
may
raise
other
constitutional
questions.
but
here
de
novo
review
of
the
kind
that
is
typical
under
the
magistrates
act
is
actually
precluded
by
the
tax
court's
rule.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not
necessarily,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
at
least
mean
in
order
for
the
statute
to
be
complied
with
that
the
regular
tax
court
judge
to
whom
the
report
of
the
special
trial
judge
returns
must
at
least
demonstrate
as
he...
as
the
district
court
must
over
in
the
magistrate
setting
that
he
has
looked
at
or
engaged
with...
looked
beneath
the
findings
of
the
special
judge
to
the
record
and
the
arguments
of
the
parties
below.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not
necessarily,
but
at
least
by
the
operation
of
a
general
rule
that
provides
that
this
engagement
will
take
place.
that's
the
kind
of
rule
that
is
in
place
in
the
magistrates
act.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
right.
and
the
only...
the
only
circuit
court
to
interpret
the
statute
has
read
it
to
require
clearly
erroneous
review.
but
the
problem
with
the
rule
goes
further
than
the...
its
application
of
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
if
you
wish
to
read
it
that
way.
notice
that
in
rule
183,
there
is
no
opportunity
to
for
the
parties
to
see
or
to
object
to
the
special
trial
judge's
report
between
the
time
it
is
written
and
filed
with
the
regular
tax
court
judge
and
the
tax
court
judge's
issuance
of
the
opinion.
the
first--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
look...
there
are
three
key
moments
in
the
case,
justice
o'connor,
in
answer
to
that
question.
when
petitioners
came
to
the
tax
court
back
in
1982,
they
sought
adjudication
of
their
alleged
deficiencies
before
a
regular
tax
court
judge,
and
they
were
so
assigned
to
regular
tax
court
judge
wilbur,
presidential
appointee.
judge
wilbur
began
to
try
the
case...
try
the
case
from
june
1984
through
november
1985,
when
he
suddenly
became
ill.
so
there
was
no
pre-trial
consent
to
the
special
trial
judge
presiding
in
the
case.
first
key
moment
in
the
case
is
in
november
1985,
after
this
illness
sets
in,
when...
in
mid
trial...
the
petitioners
consented
to
have
a
special
trial
judge,
special
trial
judge
powell,
sit
as
an
evidentiary
referee
while
the
proceedings
were
videotaped
so
that
judge
wilbur
could
still
make
the
decision
in
the
first
instance
based
on
the
videotape.
time
goes
by...
december
1985
to
june
1986.
special
trial
judge
powell
does
conduct
the
proceedings.
and
then
after
the
trial
is
complete,
after
all
the
evidence
is
taken,
in
july
1986
for
the
first
time
is
it
proposed
by
chief
judge
sterrett
of
the
tax
court
that
justice...
judge
powell,
special
trial
judge
powell,
actually
file
the
report
under
the
provisions
of
(b)(4).
so
there
was
a
mid-trial
consent
to
his
continuing
the
case
as
an
evidentiary
referee.
and
there
was
a
post-trial
consent
to
his
filing
the
report.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
o'connor,
let
me
be
clear
on
a
distinction
between
this
case...
the
freytag
case...
and
the
peretz
case
which
you
just
heard.
in
peretz
there
was
an
issue
of
waiver
of
the
statutory
claim.
there
is
before
this
court
no
issue
of
waiver
of
the
statutory
claim.
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
statutory
claim
was
not
waived
by
the
petitioners'
mid-trial
consent
to
evidentiary
refereeing
or
post-trial
consent
to
the
filing
of
the
report.
the
government
didn't
cross-petition
and
has
raised
no
claim
of
statutory
waiver
here.
so,
in
contrast
to
peretz,
i
believe
the
statutory
question
really
must
be
reached.
as
to
the
question
of
whether
the
constitutional
claim
can
be
waived,
we
argue
quite
simply
that
it's
a
structural
claim
of
precisely
the
kind
that
you,
speaking
for
the
court,
justice
o'connor,
in
cftc
v.
schor
said
waiver
should
not
affect.
but
just
to
return
to
the
third
key
moment
in
the
trial
if
i
could,
it's
october
21st,
1987,
when
we
argue
that
the
key
decision
effectively
by
the
special
trial
judge
is
realized.
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
october
21st,
1987,
is
the
day
on
which
the
chief
judge
of
the
tax
court,
judge
sterrett,
does
two
things
on
the
same
day.
number
one,
he
issues
an
order
reassigning
the
case
to
himself
from
special
trial
judge
powell,
who
sometime
in
the
proceeding
4
months
had
filed
a
report
with
the
chief
judge
of
the
tax
court.
second,
on
the
same
day,
he
adopts
and
a...
he
states
in
an
opinion
that
he
agrees
with
and
adopts
the
findings
of
the
special
trial
judge.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
justice
blackmun.
the
problem
with
that
two-sentence...
a
signature
plus
two
sentences
added
to
the
55
pages
of
the
special
trial
judge's
report...
is
that
there
is
no
basis
to
suppose
there
was
meaningful
review
or
therefore
meaningful
supervision
that
would
enable
us
to
accept
this
as
the
decision
of
the
tax
court
rather
than
of
the
special
trial
judge
himself.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
blackmun,
as
i've
said
before,
we
rely
on
the
presumption
of
administrative
regularity
under
the
tax
court's
own
rules,
even
if
you
should
indulge
the
government's
speculation
that
it
might
have
been
5
days.
i
would
add
the
government
does
not
disagree
with
us
that
a
rubber
stamp
would
be
ultravirus
against
statutory
authority.
the
government
simply
tries
to
suggest
that
perhaps
it
was
5
days
or
2
days
or
14
days...
who
knows?
the
parties
can't
know,
because
they
have
no
opportunity
to
see
the
special
trial
judge's
report
or
know
when
it
is
filed
or
object
to
it,
unlike
the
procedure
in
the
magistrate's
court.
but
supposing
it
was
5
days,
justice
blackmun,
we
argue
that
the
tax
court's
rules,
which
we
should
presume
were
followed
here,
preclude
de
novo
review,
permit
at
most
clearly
erroneous
review
and,
because
there
is
no
opportunity
for
the
parties
to
object,
do
not
put
the
regular
tax
court
judge
to
any
obligation
to
look
beneath
the
special
trial
judge's
own
findings.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
ah,
yes.
well,
it's
an
alternative
argument,
justice
blackmun.
we
do
think
that
there
is
nothing...
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
the
regular
tax
court
judge
actually
reviewed
the
case.
in
fact,
october
21st,
1987,
is
the
day
he
reassigned
it
to
himself.
and
if
you
look
at
tax
court
rule
182(b)...
if
i
could
turn
you
back
to
a91
for
a
moment.
a91,
tax
court
rule
183(b),
you
will
see
the
appropriate
sequence
for
the
reassignment
of
a
case
from
a
special
trial
judge
to
a
regular
court
judge.
the
special
trial
judge
shall
submit
his
report
to
the
chief
judge.
and
the
chief
judge
will
assign--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--page
a91,
rule
183,
paragraph
b,
final
two
lines
of
the
rule...
final
three
lines.
the
special
trial
judge
submits
a
report
and
at
that
point
the
chief
judge
will
assign
the
case
to
a
division
of
the
court.
turning
over
to
the
next
side
of
the
page,
rule
(c).
rule
(c)
says
the
division
to
which
the
case
is
assigned
may
adopt,
modify,
reject,
or
as
happened
here,
simply
adopt
verbatim
completely
the
rulings
of
the
special
trial
judge.
if
we
presume
administrative
regularity,
justice
blackmun,
there
can
be
no
inference
other
than
that.
october
21st,
the
case
came--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
right.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--actually,
your
honor--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--like
the
line
in
annie
hall
where
woody
allen
says,
i
just
happen
to
have
marshall
mcluhan
right
here.
[laughter]
i
won't
ask
him,
your
honor.
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
not
that...
we
cast
no
aspersion
on
chief
judge
sterrett
personally
in
the
least.
what
we
are
doing
here
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
that
there
was
meaningful
review
is
arguing
about
what
we
should
presume
from
the
regular
procedures
of
the
tax
court
that
chief
judge
sterrett
can
be
expected
faithfully
to
adhere
to.
and
the
published
rules
of
the
tax
court
say
you
reassign
the
special
trial
judge's
case
to
a
judge
of
the
tax
court
and
then
that
judge
reviews
it.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
justice?
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
i
believe
we
might
accept
that,
justice
marshall.
but
the
fact
is
under
the
tax
court's
rules,
the
chief
judge
of
the
tax
court
could
not
review
all
of
the
objections
of
the
parties
to
the
special
trial
judge's
findings
because
they
never
got
to
see
them.
up
until
1984,
the
tax
court
had
provided
by
its
rules
for
exceptions
by
the
parties
to
the
special
trial
judge's
report
and
an
opportunity
to
try
to
get
the
tax
court
judge
to
reject
some
of
those
findings.
that
opportunity
was
eliminated
in
1984.
one
more
fact
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
blackmun,
that
in
fact
it
was
not
clear
that
chief
judge
sterrett
would
be
the
judge
of
the
regularly
appointed
tax
court
judges
to
whom
the
case
was
reassigned.
the
stipulation...
the
agreement
by
the
parties
to
which
justice
o'connor
referred
earlier
was
to
permit
judge
powell,
the
special
trial
judge,
to
make
a
report
of
his
findings
for
reassignment
either
to
chief
judge
sterrett
or
to
judge
wilbur,
the
judge
who
had
become
ill
and
whom,
even
up
until
october
21st,
1987,
the
parties
believed
might
still
be
the
one
to
get
the
case.
so
you
cannot
presume
on
this
record
that
judge...
chief
judge
sterrett
would
have
paid
attention
to
the
case
specifically
at
any
moment
up
until
he
reassigned
the
case
to
himself,
october
21st,
1987,
the
day
he
also
issued
his--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
we
think
clearly
so
and
in
haec
verba,
our
first
question
was
not
contrary
to
the
government's
suggestion,
does
the
statute
permit
assignment
of
special
trial
judges
only
to
preside
at
(b)(4)
cases.
our
question
presented
and
the
one
accepted...
granted
the
review
in
the
court
was,
as
you
can
see
from
the
first
page
of
our
cert.
petition,
are
complex
tax
cases
allowed
to
be
assigned
to
a
special
trial
judge
for
trial
and
effective
resolution.
in
fact,
effective
resolution
is
the
heart
of
our
statutory
claim
and
it
was
the
ground
on
which
the
fifth
circuit
decided
below.
the
fifth
circuit
decided
there
was
no
rubber
stamp,
and
hence,
we
were
out
of
luck.
we
claim
that,
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
a
rubber
stamp
or
not,
the
tax
court's
rules
ensure
that,
as
happened
in
this
case,
the
usual
opportunities
for
supervision
and
control
that
one
would
expect
in
an
adjunct
adjudicatory
scheme
like
this
are
missing.
in
other
words,
just
to
put
our
point
succinctly,
congress
did
not
and
could
not
have
intended
special
trial
judges
in
large,
complex,
multiparty,
multimillion
dollar
tax
shelter
cases...
alleged
tax
shelter
cases
such
as
this
one...
congress
did
not
and
could
not
have
intended
such
cases
to
be
in
effect
decided
by
the
autonomous
actions
of
a
special
trial
judge.
now,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
statutory
claim,
i'll
move
on
to
our
constitutional
argument.
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
should
you
agree
with
us
that
the
statute
was
violated
by
the
tax
court's
rules
and
conduct
in
this
case,
you
would
then
nonetheless
need
to
reach...
sorry...
should...
if
you
agree
with
us
on
the
statute,
you
need
not
reach
our
constitutional
claim.
but
should
you
disagree
with
us
on
the
statute,
let
me
state
as
simply
as
i
can
what
the
key
points
of
difference
and
agreement
are
between
us
and
the
government.
now,
of
course,
we
deal
here
with
one
of
the
plainest
texts
in
the
constitution...
the
appointments
clause
that
permits
congress
to
delegate
the
power
to
appoint
inferior
officers
to
the
president
alone,
not
at
issue
here,
to
the
heads
of
departments,
or
the
courts
of
law.
now,
if
i
could
dispose
quickly
of
the
employee
point
and
the
court
of
law
point,
i
will
get
to
the
key
point
of
difference
between
us
and
the
government,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
tax
court
may
possibly
be
considered
an
executive
department
for
appointments
clause
purposes
and
thus
its
chief
judge
the
head
of
that
department.
i
think
the
employee
point
and
the
court
of
law
argument
can
be
dismissed
quickly.
it
is
beyond
serious
dispute
that
special
trial
judges
are
inferior
officers
of
the
united
states.
they
are
far
more
than
mere
ministerial
aides.
they...
and
every
court
to
have
decided
this
question
has
agreed.
in
terms
of
this
court's
own
definition
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
satisfy
every
formal
definition
of
what
an
officer
is.
they
hold
office
created
by
congress.
justice
o'connor?
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
the
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
of
germaine
from
the
late
19th
century
and
burnap,
a
justice
brandeis
opinion
from
the
early
20th,
are
perhaps
helpful
in
resolving
the
question
of
who
is
and
isn't
an
officer.
but
we
would
rely
more
heavily
on
your
statement
more
recently
in
buckley
that
the
function...
the
functional
test
for
an
officer
is
whether
he
exercises
significant
authority
pursuant
to
the
law.
now,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
special
trial
judge,
whether
presiding,
or
as
we
argue
he
did
here,
deciding
the
case,
is
exercising
significant
authority.
in
fact
we
would
argue
that
there's
a
parallel
here
between
special
trial
judges
and
magistrates,
except
that
magistrates
are
more
effectively
supervised
under
the
practice
of
the
article
iii
courts
by
their...
the
district
courts
under
article
iii.
but
in
any
event--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes,
justice
scalia.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
how's
that?
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
right,
your
honor.
it's...
it's
more
clear,
but
we
absolutely
disagree
that
the
officer
is
demoted
to
employee
when
he
is
merely
presiding.
we
think
that's
in
appropriate.
he...
a
magistrate
does
not
cease
to
be
an
officer
and
become
a
merely
employee
when
he
is
carrying
out
pretrial
hearings
as
opposed
to
disposing
of
a
case.
and
just
as
a
lawyer
is
still
a
lawyer,
protected
by
the
attorney-client
privilege,
if
she's
at
the
xerox
machine,
just
as
the
president
is
still
president
when
he's
walking
the
dog
on
the
white
house
lawn,
so
a
special
trial
judge
cannot
become
an
employee
just
because
he
is
performing
a
task
that
could
have
been
performed
by
an
employee.
so
we
would
respectfully
say...
respectfully
suggest
that
even
if
there
were
effective
supervision
consistent
with
the
statute,
the
special
trial
judge
would
still
be
an
officer.
and
thus,
even
in
presiding
in
(b)(4)
cases,
would
raise
the
constitutional
issue.
but
in
any
case,
if
you
agree
as...
that
the
special
trial
judge
is
an
inferior
officer,
we
agree
fully
with
the
government
that
the
tax
court
cannot
be
considered
a
court
of
law
for
purposes
of
the
appointments
clause.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
territorial
courts
we
think
are
unreached
by
any
appointments
clause
constraint,
because
when
congress
exercises
its
territorial
authority,
it
is
acting
in
effect
as
a
state.
separation
of
powers
concerns
don't
apply.
as
to
nonterritorial
article
i
courts--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--i...
i'd
have
to
put
it
over
with
the
territorial
courts
for
purposes
of
the
last
remark.
i--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--you
need
not
reach
the
question
whether
they're
a
department
because
separation
of--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--not
a
department
if
you
had
to
reach
it.
not
a
department
if
you
had
to
reach
it.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not
courts
of
law
or
executive
departments.
for
appointments
clause
purposes--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--they
are
out...
you
need
not
decide
that.
you
need
not
decide--
[laughter]
--any
question
about
the
fourth
branch
of
government
here.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
assuming
you
wish
to
issue...
i
can't
assume
you
would
wish
to
issue
an
advisory
opinion
on
the
status
of
the
fourth
branch.
let
me
just
say
that
the
government
has
argued
that
there
are
only
three
branches.
everything
in
the
federal
government
has
to
fall
within
those--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--we
argue
that
they
are
not
empowered
under
the
appointments
clause
to
appoint
officers
because
they
are...
you
need
not
reach
it
but
if
you
had
to...
they
are
neither
courts
of
law
nor--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--maybe
employees.
you've
never
held
they're
inferior
officers.
maybe
employees.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
they
are
not
courts
of
law
because
they
lack
the
independence
guaranteed
article
iii
courts
through
the
salary
and
tenure
clauses
of
article
iii.
courts
of
law
in
article
ii
must
mean
courts
of
law
in
article
iii.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
they
may
do
so.
they
may
exercise
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
but
the
appointment
power
does
not
follow
the
judicial
power
wherever
it
may
go.
and
all
bankruptcy
judges
appoint
their
clerks--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--absolutely
for
appointment
clause
purposes.
because
remember
the
purposes
of
the
appointments
clause
on
which
we
and
the
government
agree...
the
purpose
of
the
appointment
clause
was
to--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--now
agree
after
many
changes
of
heart
on
the
government's
part,
which
is
why
you
cannot
rely
on
the
executive
branch
to
preserve
and
champion
the
appointments
clause
in
this
case.
[laughter]
but
on
the
waiver
point--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--on
courts
of
law...
to
be...
courts
of
law
and
heads
of
department
make
sense
if
the
goal
of
the
constitution
is
to
distance
from
congress
the
awesome
power
to
appoint
executive
officers.
what
distances
an
entity
from
congress?
either
the
independence
that
you
and
the
other
article
iii
judges
enjoy
through
the
tenure
and
salary
clauses,
which
article
i
courts
lack...
or
protection
through
the
political
might
and
muscle
of
the
president.
the
tax
court...
and
it's
like
in
this
respect
the
courts
justice
stevens
mentions...
lacks...
uniquely
lacks
both
those
attributes.
they
are
not
independent
like
article
iii
judges.
they
are
not
executive...
or
controlled
or
supervised
or
protected
by
the
president.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
they
might
raise
in...
certain...
certainly
not.
that...
well,
it
would
not
raise
an
article
iii
problem.
it
might
be
in
congress,
and
the
key
point
is
that--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--the
appointments
clause
would
not
apply.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
that
our
argument
would
permit
congress
to
make
that--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--hiring
decision.
it's
not
an
appointment.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
there's
no
case
i
know
of
that
supports
that
position,
so
long
as
congress
is
not
appointing
itself
officers
of
the
united
states,
as
you
ruled
it
couldn't
do
in
buckley,
an
appointments
clause
is
not
presented.
if
i
could
just
conclude,
your
honor,
and
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
there's
any
left.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
justice
stevens.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not
a
department,
can't
be
a
department,
no
executive
functions
whatsoever.
the
tax--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--it
may
be
that
congress
should
not...
in
the
government's
view
perhaps
in
other
view...
people's
view...
perhaps
congress
should
not
create
entities
that
are
outside
the
tripartite
structure
of
government
but
it
has.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
congress
moved
it
out
of
the
executive
branch
in
1969.
it
cannot
be
in
the
executive
branch.
congress
did
not
put
it
in
the
judicial
branch.
it
is
not
in
the
legislative
branch.
it
is
neither
executive,
judicial,
nor
legislative.
last
point,
we
don't
necessarily--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--they
might
well
be.
key
point
in
our
case
is
that
the
legislative
courts
are
not
the
same
thing
as
the
independent
agencies.
the
government's
main
argument
is
not
that
the
constitution
has
been
complied
with
here.
it's
that
if
the
constitution
were
complied
with,
the
government
says
the
fcc,
the
ftc,
the
sec
might
lose
their
appointment
power.
well,
that's
just
not
so.
the
legislative
court
known
as
the
tax
court
is
distinct
from
the
agencies
in
very
significant
ways.
it's
budget
goes
straight
to
congress,
not
through
omb.
it
elects
its
own
chief
judge.
the
president
hand-picks
the
chairmen
of
the
agencies
and
can
be
expected
to
control
them.
we
respectfully
request
that
the
case
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial
before
the--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--regular
tax
court
judge.
thank
you.
