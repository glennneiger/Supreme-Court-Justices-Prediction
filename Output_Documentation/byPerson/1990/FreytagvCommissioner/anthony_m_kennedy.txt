justice
kennedy
well,
it
precludes...
it
precludes
making
the
decision
of
the
court.
justice
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
if
it
precludes
making
the
decision,
which
is
subject
to
the
review
of
the
court,
in
de
novo
proceeding.
justice
kennedy
what
are
they?
justice
kennedy
no
we...
assume
we
want
to.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
yes,
but
what
i'm...
i'm
asking--
--what
do
you
argue...
what
do
you
argue
as
to
the
status
of
the
courts
that
justice
stevens
mentioned?
justice
kennedy
do
they
exercise
the
judicial
power
or
are--
justice
kennedy
--well,
we're
asking
what
is
a
court,
and
you're
saying
it
exercises
part
of
the
judicial
power,
and
congress
calls
it...
calls
it
a
court.
we
call
it
a
court
in
palmore.
and
you
say
it's
not
a
court?
justice
kennedy
at
what
point
would
it
have
done
so?
on
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
after
judge
sterrett's
decision?
justice
kennedy
--suppose
the
tax
court
judge
said
in
exercising
my
determination
whether
to
reject
or
accept
this
depart...
this
report,
i
must
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
presumed
to
be
correct.
is
that
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
regulation?
justice
kennedy
so
that
he...
so
that
he
must
presume
it
correct
before
he
exercises
his
discretion
to
reject
it
or
adopt
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
there
would
be
some
concern
if
there
was
a
rule
that
the
law
clerk's
draft
was
presumed
correct.
i
mean,
they
might
think
so.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
well,
you
don't
think
that
congress
could...
or
maybe
you
do...
appoint
a
territorial
governor?
