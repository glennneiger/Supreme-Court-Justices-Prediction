we'll
hear
next
in
argument
no.
90-762,
thomas
freytag
v.
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
ms.
sullivan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
page
of
the...
this
is--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--a92.
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say...
when
you
say
de
novo
review,
ms.
sullivan,
you
mean
complete
examination
of
every
question
of
fact
without
any
presumption
of
correctness
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you...
do
you
mean
demonstrate
by
some
sort
of
a
written
opinion
of
his
own?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
saying
as
i
understand
it
that
this
particular
tax
court
rule
which
we're
talking
about
here
ensures
that
the
special
judges
will
end
up
deciding
the
cases.
now,
i...
i
don't
read
the
rule
that
way.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
say
that
if
you're
talking
about
a
factual
finding
being...
presumed
to
be
correct,
you
could
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
chief
justice
rehnquist
reading
from
page
a91?
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
sullivan--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
wonder
if
questions
of
these
rather
detailed
facts
are
fairly
subsumed
under
the
questions
presented
in
your
writ
of
petition...
writ
of
certiorari?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ms.
sullivan
is
it
your
position
that
in
the
case
of
a
territorial
court,
congress
could
provide
that
the
speaker
of
the
house
would
appoint
the
judges?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
appointments
clause
just
wouldn't
apply
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
our
closest
case
to
support--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
what's
the
closest
case--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--what's
the
closest
case
from
this
court
that
supports
that
position
do
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
sullivan.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
the
proposed
findings
of
the
parties
submitted
to
the
special
trial
judge?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course
you
don't
submit
proposed
findings
to
a
law
clerk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-762
freytag
against
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
