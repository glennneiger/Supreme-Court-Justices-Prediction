justice
stevens
--how
about
the...
all
these
other
courts
that
mr.
griswold
describes
in
his
brief...
the
claims
court,
the
territorial
courts,
the
land
courts,
the
district
of
columbia
courts.
those
all
executive
departments?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
district
of
columbia,
by
the
way,
in
your
particular
dichotomy
here?
justice
stevens
i
see.
so
they...
and
again...
tell
me
again,
you
say
they
are
a
department
there?
justice
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
i'm
curious
about
what
your
answer
would
be
even
if
we
don't
have
to
reach
it.
justice
stevens
so
they
are
courts
of
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
appointments
clause.
justice
stevens
well,
they
were
empowered
by
statute
to
appoint
clerks,
who
are
inferior
officers.
justice
stevens
well,
let's
assume
for
a
moment
they
were
inferior
officers.
the
clerks
of
the
court
are
pretty
important.
they're
officers
of
the
court.
our
clerk
is
an
officer
of
the
court.
now,
if
they
are
inferior
officers,
you
would...
and
the
courts
exercise
judicial
power
beginning
with
the...
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
the
very
early
case,
why
are
they
not
courts
of
law?
and
if
they're
not...
if
they're
courts
of
law,
why
is
not
this
tax
court
also
a
court
of
law?
justice
stevens
which
you
and
the
government
now
agree.
justice
stevens
and
that's
why
maybe
the
appointment
was
if...
with
the
courts
of
law
then.
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
though.
justice
stevens
if
they're...
if
they're
not
courts
of
law
and
they're
an
executive
department,
as
you
agree
with
the
government,
why
then
isn't
the
chief
judge
the
head
of
the
department?
justice
stevens
what
are
they?
they're
not
a
department
and
they're
not
a
court
of
law.
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
they
shouldn't
have.
what
is
your
view
as
to
the
status
of
these
tribunals?
justice
stevens
that...
that's
like
the
fcc
and
the
independent
regulatory
agencies
who
are
considered...
who
are
considered
heads
of...
heads
of
departments.
they
have
their
chairman
on
it.
justice
stevens
may
i
back
up
just
a
second?
you're
saying
because...
that
they
don't
have
standing
to
challenge
the
status
of
the
officer
because,
even
if
duties
under
(1),
(2)
and
(3)
would
have
been
required...
were
performed
by
an
officer
of
the
united
states,
but
if
this
assistant
judge
is
performing
those
duties,
the
appointment
would
be
invalid,
wouldn't
it?
unless
there...
i
mean...
the
constitutional
issue
would
be
presented
as
to...
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you're
saying
they
don't
have
standing
to
make
that
argument.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see
your...
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
stevens
now
the
government
take...
now
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
all
these
other
courts
that
i
referred
to
before?
district
of
columbia,
territorial
courts...
all
those
are
in
the
executive
branch?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
tell
me
again
why
the
different
power
of
congress
is
exercising...
creating
the
district
of
columbia
courts
and
territorial
courts...
but
why
does
that
make
the
appointment
clause
issue
any
different?
justice
stevens
but
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy.
if
the
appointment
clause
doesn't
apply,
why
couldn't
congress
appoint
the...
a
governor
of
the
territory?
justice
stevens
then
congress
could
appoint
the
staff
of
the
governor
and
the
staff
of
the
court.
justice
stevens
well,
the
appointments
clause
gives
some
power
of
courts
of
law
to
make
appointments.
do
you
think,
as
for
the
territorial
courts,
they
could
have
authorized
this
court
to
appoint
the
clerk
of
the
territorial
courts?
we're
certainly
a
court
of
law.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
how
is
the
chief
judge
of
this
court
appointed?
justice
stevens
and
is
that...
is
that
a
valid
method
of
appointing
a
head
of
a
department
in
the
executive
branch?
justice
stevens
well,
i
know
no
challenge
has
been
raised,
but
under
your
argument
it
is
clearly
invalid,
is
it
not,
because
the
appointment
was
not
made
by
the
head
of
a
department?
justice
stevens
well,
surely
the
chief
judge
is
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
justice
stevens
well,
it
gives
him
the
authority
to
appoint
assistant
trial
judges.
justice
stevens
that's
pretty
importance
difference,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
but
under
your
argument
it
is
clear
that
the
present
appointment
of
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
is
invalid
i
think?
justice
stevens
i
know
it
hasn't
been
raised,
but
i'm
trying
to
think
of
the
implications
of
accepting
your
argument.
justice
stevens
can
you
give
me
a
reason
why,
consistent
with
your
argument,
that
the
appointment
could
be
valid...
the
appointment
by
his
colleagues
as
chief
judge?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
but
not
a
head
of
a
department
with
authority
to
appoint
assistant
trial
judges?
justice
stevens
he
became
head
by
collegial
action
that
did
not
have
to
comply
with
the
appointments
clause?
justice
stevens
a
question
we
can
entirely
avoid
if
we
assume
it's
a
court
of
law.
