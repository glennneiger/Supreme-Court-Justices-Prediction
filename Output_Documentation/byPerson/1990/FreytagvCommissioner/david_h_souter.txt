justice
souter
mr.
roberts,
before
you
get
into
the
substance,
what
about
the
argument
that
you
didn't
cross
appeal...
that
the...
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
decide
the
waiver
point,
decided
against
you,
and
you
didn't
cross
appeal?
justice
souter
well,
are
you
resting
on
the
appointments
clause
or
just
a
concept
of
congressional
power?
