justice
scalia
the
first
amendment
requires
that
these
contractual
obligations
be
enforceable.
justice
scalia
you're
taking
the
polar
view
from
the
view
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
took.
justice
scalia
i--
justice
scalia
--isn't
it
conceivable
that
the
first
amendment
neither
requires
nor
prohibits?
is
that
a
possible
resolution?
justice
scalia
but--
justice
scalia
you
think
maybe
only
the
government
can
get
prior
restraint
of
publication?
is
that...
is
that
it?
the
snepp
case
is
all
right,
but
nobody
else
can
get
prior
restraint
except
the
government?
justice
scalia
that
may
be
the
law.
justice
scalia
you
seem
very
much
worried
about
it.
mr.
rothenberg,
doesn't
the
state
court
decision
rest
on
the
state
supreme
court's
view
of
good
policy.
it...
it
points
out
that
the...
that
the
question
arises
in
what
it
calls
a
classic
first
amendment
context.
it
closes
the
discussion
in
that
paragraph
by
saying,
"considering
the
nature
of
the
political
story
involved,
it
seems
to
us
the
law
best
leaves
the
parties
here
to
their
trust
in
each
other.
"
then
it
goes
on
to
talk
about
first
amendment
demands.
but
doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
court
rest
its
decision
on
its
own
view
of
where
the
law
best
leaves
the
parties.
and
isn't
that
the
holding
of
the
case?
justice
scalia
mr.
rothenberg,
i
thought
when
they
said
the
law
best
leaves
the
parties
to
the
trust
in
each
other,
they
included
within
the
law
the
first
amendment.
isn't
the
first
amendment
part
of
the
law?
justice
scalia
oh.
may
i
ask
you
a
variation
of
justice
souter's
question?
supposing
you
had
two
statutes,
one
in
one
state
and
one
in
another.
one
state
had
a
statute
that
just
said,
contracts
of
this
kind
or
promises
of
this
kind
shall
not
be
enforceable,
period.
and
the
other
state
the
statute
said
the
same
thing,
but
it
had
a
preamble
that
said,
because
the
members
of
the
legislature
are
convinced
that
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
xto
have
such
a
statute,
contracts
like
this
are
unenforceable.
would...
each
of
those
be...
would
they
both
be...
have
the
same
constitutional
result?
would
they
both
be
valid
or
invalid,
or
would
you
get
one
result
in
one
case
and
another
in
the
other
case?
justice
scalia
you're
saying
more
than
that.
you're
saying
contract
obligations
can't
stand
in
way.
what
if
a
reporter
for
a...
for
a
newspaper
in
violation
of
his
contractual
obligations
to
his
employer
is
for
money
leaking
scoops
to
a
competing
newspaper.
don't
you
think
that
the...
that
the
newspaper
that
hires
him
should
be
able
to
sue
him
for
that...
for
that
breach
of
his
agreement?
justice
scalia
even
though
he's
turning
over
the
most
newsworthy
material
in
the
world.
justice
scalia
well,
wait,
wait,
wait...
excuse
me.
why
is
that
proprietary
information?
i
mean
it
is
confidential
information
that
the
paper
received.
right?
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
that
any
different
from
the
confidential
information
that
was
transmitted
to
the
reporter
here?
justice
scalia
all
important
contract
rights.
justice
scalia
mr.
french,
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
balancing.
and
there
are
two
ways
that
this
opinion
that
this
opinion
might
be
understood.
i
suppose
you...
you
might
say
that
all
it's
saying...
and
this
is
your
position...
all
it's
saying
is
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
first
amendment
considerations.
but
it
might
also
be
saying
that
the
first
amendment,
not
in
all
circumstances
but
in
some
circumstances,
prohibits
the
penalty
for
the
contractual
breach.
i'm
sorry
if
i
went
over
your
time.
justice
scalia
i
think
the
chief
justice
will
let
you--
--by
all
means
answer
the
question.
justice
scalia
of
course,
you
can't
say
it
comes
from
a
reliable
source
if
you
get
it
in
an
unmarked
envelop,
and
i
assume
no
responsible
reporter
would
use
it
if
it
just
came...
you
know,
unless
it
was
independently
verifiable
somehow.
well,
i
guess
if
it
was...
the
question
here
was
just
a
court
record
of
an
earlier
prosecution
which
then
the
paper
could
obviously
check
it.
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
were
making
a
more
general
argument,
mr.
rothenberg,
about
the
utility
of
having
contractual
liability
in
general,
not
just
in
this
particular
case.
just
in
this
particular
case,
if
that's
the
argument
you're
making,
it's
not--
