mr.
john
d.
french
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
on
the
merits...
if
the
court
reaches
the
merits...
is
whether
a
reporter's
oral
promise
to
a
source
is
sufficient
reason
to
punish
the
publication
of
truthful
information
on
a
matter
of
public
significance
where
the
promise
does
not
satisfy
the
standards
for
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right,
and
as
a
matter
of
state
law
does
not
even
amount
to
a
legally
binding
contract.
two
facts
in
the
case
are
clear
beyond
dispute.
mr.
john
d.
french
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
but
this
is
an
easier
case,
i
think.
mr.
john
d.
french
the
two
facts
that
i
believe
are
beyond
dispute
is
that
the
publications
at
issue
are
entirely
true,
and
that
they
involved
matters
of
public
significance.
as
the
minnesota
supreme
court
observed,
this
was
the
quintessential
public
debate
in
our
democratic
society.
the
four
news
organizations
which
received
the
information
from
mr.
cohen--
mr.
john
d.
french
--it's
the
same
principle,
but
the
decisions
of
this
court
say,
your
honor,
that
it
is
clear
that
there
should
be
protection
accorded
to
the
publication
of
truthful
information
about
matters
of
public
significance.
the
point
i'm
making
here
is
plainly
it
was
truthful
information.
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
said
part
of
the
quintessential
debate
in
our
society,
therefore,
obviously
a
matter
of
public
significance.
mr.
john
d.
french
the
election
campaign
in
toto,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
the
information
about
mr.
cohen
was
information
that
was
a
part
of
a
story
about
matters
of
public
significance.
it
is
possible
for
news
organizations
to
print
the
name
of
mr.
cohen
in
a
situation
like
this
or
to
leave
it
out.
as
the
court
knows
from
the
briefs,
our
two
clients
here
today
printed
his
name.
the
associated
press
did
not
print
his
name.
wcco
television
didn't
carry
the
story
at
all.
that's
the
point,
your
honor.
this
is
not
only
the
area
of
quintessential
debate--
mr.
john
d.
french
--absolutely
right.
and
those
are
the
people--
mr.
john
d.
french
--you
should
choose
to
allow
reasonable
editors
to
differ,
your
honor.
that
is
our
point.
this
is
subject
for
editorial
judgment...
i--
mr.
john
d.
french
--no,
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
if
there
is
any
basis
for
a
challenge
such
as
that
leveled
at
these
two
newspapers
by
mr.
cohen,
that
basis
pales
to
insignificance
when
the
subject
is
truthful
information
about
a
matter
of
public
significance.
mr.
john
d.
french
such
as
there
was
involved
in
the
snepp
case,
but
in
the
snepp
case
what
the
court
had
before
it
was,
number
one,
protecting
national
security,
and
number
two,
as
the
court
said,
a
fiduciary
relationship
of
the
highest
order.
also,
in
snepp,
the
court
did
not
hold
that
the
information
could
not
be
published.
it
simply
held
that
the
prepublication
review
agreement
was
valid.
mr.
john
d.
french
it's
not
a
prepublication
case,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
case
reveals
why
it
comes
so
close
to
being
prepublication.
these
newspapers
have
had
to
live
now
for
9
years
with
a
lawsuit
which
at
the
trial
stage
appeared
to
be
going
to
cost
them
$700,000
in
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
and
of
course,
has
over
the
course
of
9
years
cost
them
countless
thousands
in
attorneys'
fees.
that
kind
of
sanction
can
be
just
as
chilling
on
free
speech
as
the
sanction
imposed
by
prepublication
injunction.
mr.
john
d.
french
it's
still
something
they
can
weigh
in
the
balance,
but
it's
something
in
my
judgment
they
should
not
have
to
weigh
in
the
balance.
mr.
john
d.
french
that's
absolutely
right,
mr.
chief
justice
and
these
newspapers
live
with
it.
they
live
with
it
under
the
antitrust
laws.
they
live
with
it
under
the
labor
laws.
they
live
with
it
under
the
laws
of
taxation.
here
we
are
talking
about
the
core
business
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
the
business
of
publishing
the
truth.
and
in
that
area,
they
should
not
have
to
live
under
this.
justice
frankfurter
has
a
nice
phrase
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
associated
press
where
he
talks
about
the
business
of
the
press
being
truth
and
understanding,
not
the
sale
of
wares
like
peanuts
and
potatoes.
this
is
a
case
in
which
mr.
cohen
and
his
counsel
are
arguing
that
it
is
appropriate
by
agreement
to
suppress
the
publication
of
truthful
information
about
a
matter
of
public
significance.
they
are
not
suing
because
they
sold
a
product
or
a
service
to
these
newspapers
and
didn't
get
paid.
they
are
suing
because
a
piece
of
truthful
information
came
to
light
in
the
course
of
a
heated
political
campaign.
mr.
john
d.
french
it
was
not
wrong
at
the
level
of
the
newspaper
reporter,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
you'd
have
a
different
case,
because
i
think
you'd
get
closer
to
fraud
and
there
would
be
more
to
weigh
in
the
balance
on
mr.
cohen's
side.
there's
nothing
in
the
balance
on
his
side
right
now.
i
do
not
suggest
that
i
think
mr.
cohen
ought
to
win
that
case.
what
i...
what
i...
my
main
theme
that
i
want
to
assure
the
court
that
i
am
advancing
throughout
my
argument
is
this.
you
heard
mr.--
mr.
john
d.
french
--no,
they
do
not
control
the
case.
the
controlling
issue--
mr.
john
d.
french
--the
case
that
you
put
to
you...
that
you
put
to
me,
should
in
my
judgment
still
be
a
case
in
which
the
first
amendment
is
relevant.
let
me
say
that
first,
before
i
get
to
the
direct
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
rothenberg
argued
here
today
before
this
court,
as
he
argued
in
his
briefs,
that
the
first
amendment
is
irrelevant.
it
has
no
weight.
it
doesn't
count.
all
this
court
has
to
do
in
order
to
affirm
the
minnesota
supreme
court
is
to
decide
that's
wrong.
and
plainly
that
has
to
be
wrong.
i
mean,
if
this
court's
decisions
protect
under
the
first
amendment
the
utterance
of
defamatory
speech,
surely
this
court
must
find
some
room
under
the
first
amendment
to
protect
the
utterance
of
honest,
accurate
speech.
mr.
john
d.
french
the
two
reporters
gave
mr.
cohen
a
promise
that
they
wouldn't--
mr.
john
d.
french
--they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
the
entire
truth
about
everything
did
not
get
published.
mr.
john
d.
french
but
what
this
court
has
said--
mr.
john
d.
french
--that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
what
the
court
has
said,
however,
on
that
score
is
that
that
is
a
subject
to
be
left
to
editorial
judgment.
this
court
has
said
that
editorial
judgment
is
a
part
of
the
free
press
publication
process
that
is
entitled
to
constitutional
protection.
mr.
john
d.
french
what
i
am
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
conclude
that
the
editors
are
the
repository
of
first
amendment
bestowed
rights
to
make
judgments
about
what
to
publish
and
not
to
publish.
there's...
there
was
so
much
to
publish
in
this
case,
your
honor.
they
could
have
published,
but
the
contact
was
made
with
the
candidate,
marlene
johnson,
and
she
announced
it
was
smear
campaign.
they
could
have
published,
but
they
then
contacted
the
whitney
campaign,
and
the
whitney
campaign
said,
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
and
on
and
on
and
on.
but
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
whether
the
decision
is
fair
or
unfair,
the
decision
belongs
to
the
editors,
not
to
judges.
mr.
john
d.
french
yes,
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
do
believe
it
should
be
able
to
sue,
and
it
can
sue
under
precedence
of
this
court.
first,
what
that
reporter
is
doing
is
turning
over
proprietary
information.
and
this
court
has
said
that
people
who
create
proprietary
information
have
a
right
to
reap
the
regard
of
having
created
it.
second
is--
mr.
john
d.
french
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
french
the
reporter
obtained
that
information
in
the
course
of
performing
services
for
the
newspaper.
the
right
to
his
services
belongs
to
the
newspaper.
moreover,
there
is
a...
there
is
a
fiduciary
relationship
between
the
reporter
and
his
newspaper,
which
is
another
area
which
that
this
court
said
deserves...
has
said
deserves
protection.
mr.
john
d.
french
important
contract
rights
which
do
not
suppress
publication
of
the
truth.
the
difference
here
is
that...
is
simply
the
difference
in
whose
newspaper
will
the
truth
be
published?
what
mr.
cohen--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
the...
the
press
in
our
country
stands
in
the
role
of
the
surrogate
for
the
public.
the
public
has
no
way
of
knowing
many
things
that
it
ought
to
know.
the
press
goes
and
ferrets
out
the
information
and
publishes
it.
in
the
course
of
that
process,
reporters
find
facts,
evaluate
them,
and
write
stories.
editors
decide
what
to
print
and
what
not
to
print.
and
in
the
end,
what
we're...
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
protect
the
public's
right
to
know.
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
cohen
wants,
by
contract,
to
restrict
the
ability
of
editors
to
do
their
job
and
decide
what
is
important
to
convey
to
the
public
as
part
of
its
right
to
know.
mr.
john
d.
french
no,
i
would
not
say
that,
your
honor.
that
would
not
be
my
conclusion.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
here
is
that
when
a
private
citizen
attempts
to
assert
a
right
under
contract
law...
which
by
the
way,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
said
doesn't
exist...
to
suppress
publication
of
a
piece
of
information.
and
that
information
is
truthful
and
has
to
do
with
a
matter
of
high,
public
significance,
then
under
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
decided
under
every
other
rubric
defamate...
pardon
me...
right
of
privacy,
protection
of
emotional
distress,
and
so
forth,
the
press
prevails
in
that
situation.
mr.
john
d.
french
because
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
think
the
court--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
think
the
court
could
have,
justice
white,
had
the
first
amendment
before
it
if
that's
what
the
minnesota
supreme
court
had
decided.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
believe
the
issue
is
not
here,
but
mr.
rothenberg
says
the
issue
is
here,
and
i
think
i'm
obliged
to
respond
to
mr.
rothenberg.
i
think--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
would
be
delighted
to.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
would
be
delighted
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
it
is
indeed.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
two
theories
at
trial,
breach
of
contract
and
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
the
court
of
appeals
took
away
the
fraudulent
misrepresentation
claim
on
the
ground
that
it
didn't
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
also
took
away
the
breach
of
contract
recovery.
in
both
instances
at
both
levels,
those
decisions
were
made
under
state
law.
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
first
amendment
had
no
part
to
play
in
those
rulings.
under
those
circumstances,
the
claims
that
petitioner
plead
and
tried
and
briefed
and
argued
have
been
lost
to
him
under
minnesota
state
law,
and
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
be
retrieved.
it
is--
mr.
john
d.
french
--there
is
not,
justice
o'connor,
and
with
respect
i
have
to...
i
have
to
dispute
mr.
rothenberg's
representation
of
minnesota
state
law.
i
think
the
court
can
consult
the
cowles
media
brief.
i
believe
footnote
3
at
page
13
on
this
subject.
what
happened...
in
response
to
your
question...
not
only
to
me
but
to
mr.
rothenberg,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
no
one
thought
about
promissory
estoppel
until,
on
rebuttal
argument
in
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
justice
yetka,
one
of
the
dissenting
justices,
raised
it
as
a
possibility...
isn't
it
possible
that
estoppel
might
apply
to
this
set
of
facts.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
then
did
indeed
address
it,
but
it
is
not
essential
to
the
decision
to
vacate
the
judgment
that
petitioner
won
at
the
trial
court
level
on
contract
and
fraud.
mr.
john
d.
french
it
is
difficult
in
the
context
of
minnesota
state
law
to
understand
why
justice
simonett
talked
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
it
was
the
court,
your
honor.
it
was
the
court
talking
about
it.
mr.
john
d.
french
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
french
may
i--
mr.
john
d.
french
--may
i
focus,
justice
white,
the
court's
attention
on
this
sentence.
i
believe
this
sentence
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
describes
what
the
court
was
doing.
in
deciding
whether--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
had
it
in
my
notes
here
in
front
of
me.
mr.
john
d.
french
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
that's
correct.
it
is
a-13.
in
deciding
whether
it
would
be
unjust
not
to
enforce
the
promise...
now
that's
the
framework
of
promissory
estoppel...
the
court
must
necessarily
weight
the
same
considerations
that
are
weighed
for
whether
the
first
amendment
has
been
violated.
now,
that
is...
that
sets
forth
the
thought
process
of
a
court
thinking
about
federal
principles
and
incorporating
them
into
its
analysis
of
state
law.
that
is
looking
to
federal
principle
for
guidance
rather
than
compulsion.
and
that
is
why
we
believe--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
agree,
your
honor.
and
i...
and
what...
what
i
would
ask
the
court
to
do
is...
is
as
follows.
first,
keep
in
mind,
as
justice
souter
said,
that
at
most
you
do
not
get
to
the
first
amendment
unless
you
arrive
there
as
a
alternative
holding.
the
case
could
still
have
been
decided
under
minnesota
promissory
estoppel
law,
as
i
believe
the
opinion
said
it
was,
without
a
decision
on
the
first
amendment
but
with
a
decision
that
concepts
germane
under
the
first
amendment
should
inform
the
decision.
mr.
john
d.
french
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
if
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
had
said
there
is
no
first
amendment
protection
and
mr.
cohen
prevails,
that
decision
under
promissory
estoppel
in
my
judgment
would
have
infringed
our
client's
first
amendment
rights
and
we
certainly
would
have
appealed.
all
i'm
trying
to
describe
is
what
the
supreme
court
did.
we
have...
in
the
northwest
publications
brief
at
page
25
what
i
think
is
a
useful
recitation
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
need
to
avoid
constitutional
questions
if
possible
if
the
decision
below
is
ambiguous.
and
that
would
be
my
second
point.
first,
justice
souter's
point
that
the
holdings
are
alternative
if
they
are
that.
second,
it
is
at
most
ambiguous
and
that
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue,
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
decision
on
state
law
grounds
predominates.
mr.
john
d.
french
yes,
absolutely,
justice
white.
the
trial
court
did
not
allow
it,
your
honor.
the
trial
court
ruled
that
our
first
amendment
arguments
were
not
relevant.
there
was
no
first
amendment
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
john
d.
french
no,
he
just
said...
he...
there
is
no
first
amendment
issue
in
this
case
is
what
the
trial
judge
thought.
mr.
john
d.
french
no
state
action
and
waiver
both,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
oh,
i
think
the
state
action
is
easy
under
new
york
times
against
sullivan.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
john
d.
french
--yes,
justice
white,
and
in
addition
beyond
that,
i
think
mr.
rothenberg's
invocation
of
voluntary
agreement
is
a
bit
of
a
red
herring.
you
don't
know
whether
the
agreement
does
or
does
not
have
force.
you
do
not
know
what
its
content
is.
you
do
not
know
what
the
remedies
are
until
you
apply
state
law.
so
the
law
of
the
state
of
minnesota
first
creates
the
right,
and
then
the
courts
enforce
it.
that
seems
to
me
to
give
rise
to
state
action.
mr.
john
d.
french
he
could
have
said
that,
justice
scalia--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i'm...
i'm--
mr.
john
d.
french
--yeah.
thank
you
again,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
he
could
have
said
that
two
ways
is
what
i
was...
is
about
to
suggest,
your
honor.
he
could
have
said
the
first
amendment
is
misused
or
it
is
a
misuse
of
the
first
amendment
to
think
about
first
amendment
principles
when
you're
thinking
about
promissory
estoppel.
so
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
he
is
there
saying
this
is
a
federal
first
amendment
case
or
we're
not
thinking
about
the
first
amendment
right
when
we're
applying
state
law.
the
last
suggestion
i
would
like
to
make
on
this
issue
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
which
justice
white
invited
me
to
do.
we
pointed
out
in
the
cert.
papers
that
the
question
presented
by
the
petitioner
wasn't
in
the
case.
the
petitioner's
question...
as
the
court
will
recall...
is
whether
or
not
an
immunity
should
be
conferred
on
the
press
with
respect
to
breaking
its
promises
to
sources.
now,
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
at
page
13...
i
have
that
one
on
my
own,
justice
scalia,
without
any
assistance,
thank
you.
at
page
13
of
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
finally
acknowledges
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
reserve
to
itself
the
opportunity,
perhaps
sometime
in
the
future,
to
enforce
a
promise
under
the
doctrine
of
promissory
estoppel.
what
that
means
to
me
is
the
question
that
was
presented
to
this
court
by
the
petitioner,
the
question
of
immunity
is...
by
the
petitioner's
own
words...
not
before
the
court.
and
there
are
cases
of
this
court
which
indicate
that
if
it
becomes
apparent
after
briefing
an
oral
argument,
that
the
question
upon
which
certiorari
was
granted
is
not
the
question
before
the
court,
the
writ
will
be
dismissed.
so
that
is
another
basis
i
would
suggest
for
dismissal
here.
mr.
john
d.
french
you're...
you're
saying,
justice
souter,
the
reporter
does
this
on
his
own
as
a
private
citizen?
mr.
john
d.
french
i
suppose
the
reporter
would
have
an
argument
that
the
first
amendment
applies
to
me.
if
i
were
judge,
it
would
be
very
thin.
i
do
not
see
what
the
reporter's
decision
here--
mr.
john
d.
french
--well,
i'm
back
to
the
other
hypothetical.
mr.
john
d.
french
if
he
goes
to
another
newspaper
and
publishes
it,
then
once
again,
he
has
acted
contrary
to
his
fiduciary
duty
to
his
employer
and
he
has
sold
a
piece
of
information
that
doesn't
belong
to
him.
he
obtained
the
information
in
the
course
of
performing
services
for
the
first
employer.
mr.
john
d.
french
the
newspaper
is
stuck
for
the
damages?
mr.
john
d.
french
i
believe
that
in
this
context
since
we
are
talking
about
assessing
damages
with
respect
to
the
act
of
publication,
the
newspaper
should
not
be
stuck
for
the
damages,
as
you
put
it,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
no,
i'm...
the
first
amendment
always
counts.
i...
i
have
to
come
back
to
that.
mr.
rothenberg--
mr.
john
d.
french
--when...
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
it
is
protecting
the
public's
right
to
know
and
it
is
protecting
the
process
of
editorial
judgment.
what
i
am
defending
here
is
the
right
of
these
editors
in
the
context
in
which
they
found
themselves,
having
received
substantial
additional
information
that
the
reporters
did
not
know--
mr.
john
d.
french
--your
honor--
mr.
john
d.
french
--this...
what
i...
i'll
try
again,
your
honor.
what
this
court
must
do
i
think
is
at
a
minimum
say
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
was
right
in
concluding
that
first
amendment
interest
should
be
balanced.
now,
the
court
could
go
far
beyond
that
and
erect
a
much
more
absolutist
rule
that
says
the
first
amendment
right...
the
first
amendment
interest
is
so
paramount
that
we
cannot
think
of
a
circumstance
in
which
the
promise
must
be
kept.
i
don't
ask
the
court
to
do
that
here
today,
because
i
think
i
don't
have
to.
i
think
if
the
court
will
apply
its
own
prior
holdings
that
with
respect
to
the
publication
of
truthful
information
of
matters
of
public
significance,
the
first
amendment
interest
is
paramount.
and
it
is
possible
to
balance
something
against
it.
it
is
possible
as
this
court
said...
has
said
many
times...
to
balance
a
state
interest
of
the
highest
order.
but
i
haven't
seen
one
of
those
yet.
mr.
john
d.
french
that's
all
right,
your
honor.
i'm
here
at
your
disposal.
mr.
john
d.
french
your
honor,
there
should
i
suspect...
if
we
had
100
of
these
cases
and
we
could
see
enough
fact
situations,
i
think
we
would
find
some
instances
in
which
we
would
say
if
this
is
the
interest
that
the
claimant
is
trying
to
protect,
it
is
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
first
amendment
interest,
and
the
first
amendment
interest
always
overrides.
but
there
might
also
be
some
cases
in
which
the
interest
advanced
by
the
claimant
is
regarded
by
this
court
as
an
interest...
a
state
interest
of
the
highest
order.
and
under
the
particular
facts
of
the
case,
it...
the
court
might
hold
it
was
appropriate
for
the
press
to
honor
the
promise.
