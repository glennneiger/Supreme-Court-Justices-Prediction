justice
o'connor
mr.
rothenberg,
the...
i
have
a
little
difficulty
with
the
opinion
that
we're
asked
to
review.
as
i
read
it,
the
court
first
rejected
a
contract
theory
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
o'connor
and
then
it
went
on
to
address
whether
there
was
promissory
estoppel.
that
theory
was
not
presented,
i
take
it,
to
the
jury
by
the
plaintiff
below?
justice
o'connor
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
did
you
argue
promissory
estoppel?
why
did
the
court
even
address
it?
justice
o'connor
the
problem
i
have
is
that
i
didn't
understand
how
the
court
could
address
it
at
all
if
it
was
never
urged
below.
justice
o'connor
and
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
it's
possible
to
sustain
a
jury
verdict
that
was
presented
on
a
different
theory--
justice
o'connor
--by
concluding
there
was
promissory
estoppel?
that's
the
minnesota
state
law?
justice
o'connor
now,
one
other
question
before
i
finish
if
i
may.
here,
you...
the
plaintiff
sought
damages
for
the
disclosure.
had
the
plaintiff
known
in
advance
that
there
was
a
danger
of
disclosure,
i
take
it
you
would
feel
you
could
even
go
in
and
enjoin
the
publication?
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
yes,
i
know.
is
it
your
position
that
an
injunction
could
be
sought
before
publication?
justice
o'connor
yes,
i
know
that.
is
it
your
view
that
an
injunction
could
be
sought?
justice
o'connor
mr.
french--
--but
mr.
french...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
would
lead
the
court
to
reach
a
different
result
in
branzburg
v.
hayes
as
well,
where
the
court
held
that
reporters
are
not
exempt
from
a
generally
applicable
duty
to
appear
and
respond
to
questions
before
a
grand
jury
even
though
they
might
be
asked
to
reveal
confidential
information.
you
would
say
that
decision
rests
with
the
editors,
and
apparently
that
case
would
have
to
come
out
the
other
way.
justice
o'connor
well,
how
is
it
that
the
court
got
into
its
discussion
of
promissory
estoppel?
is
there
some
minnesota
state
law
principle
that
enables
the
plaintiff
to
rely
on
that
even
though
it
wasn't
directly
raised
below?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
rothenberg,
that
troubles
me
a
little,
because
mr.
cohen
could
have
sent
the
information
in
an
unmarked
envelope
presumably,
and
the
paper
would
still
have
had
it,
right?
