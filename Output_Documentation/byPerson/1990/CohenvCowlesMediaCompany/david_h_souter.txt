justice
souter
well,
isn't
the
most
that
you
can
say
is
that
that
was
an
alternative
holding,
and
in
fact
the
second
of
the
two
pieces
of
reasoning
expressed?
doesn't
it
rest
and
wouldn't
it
rest
with
equal
decisiveness
on
the
language
that
i
just
quoted,
"seems
to
us
the
law
best
leaves
the
parties
to
their
trust
in
each
other?
"
justice
souter
no,
i
realize
that.
but
the
court
is
saying
offer
consideration
contract
theory
is
not
the
basis
upon
which
the
parties
ought
to
be
left
to
deal.
they
ought
to
be
left
to
deal
on
matters
of
trust
and
if
that
doesn't
work,
too
bad.
isn't
that
the...
isn't
that
an...
an
independent
holding
of
the
case,
if
not
the
principal
holding
of
the
case?
justice
souter
well--
justice
souter
--let
me
just
ask
you
one
question.
i
don't
want
to
prolong
this,
but
do
you
agree
that
if
the
court
had
not
gone
onto
the
further
language,
"we
conclude
that
the"...
that
the
first...
"that
there
would
be
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
in
enforcing
the
contract.
"
do
you
agree
that
if
the
court
had
not
gone
on
to
that
further
statement
that
the
holding
in
the
case
and
the
result
in
the
case
rather,
i
should
say...
the
result
in
the
case
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
it
is
now?
because
the
result
in
the
case
would
rest,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
court's
conclusion
that
the
law
best
leaves
the
parties
to
their
trust
in
each
other.
so
that
the...
wouldn't
the
result
be
exactly
the
same
if
it
had
not
gone
on
to
make
the
first
amendment
point?
justice
souter
well,
they
did
to
go
on
to
demand
them,
but
if
the
court
had
stopped
right
there
and
said,
it
seems
to
us
the
law
best
leaves
the
parties
here
to
their
trust
in
each
other,
what
would
the
result
in
the
case
have
been?
they
wouldn't
have
gone
on
and
said,
however,
we
think
we'll
enforce
the
contract.
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it
right
there,
wouldn't
it?
justice
souter
mr.
french,
assuming
we
get
to
the
first
amendment
issue,
there's
one
thing
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
i'm
not...
i
may
have
misunderstood.
would
the
result
be
any
different
in
this
case
or
would
the...
would
the
first
amendment's
significance
be
any
different
in
this
case
if
the
editors
of
the
newspaper
had
said,
we
agree
that
the
promise
ought
to
be
kept
and
yet
the
reporter
had
changed
his
own
mind,
and
said,
you
know,
i
shouldn't
have
made
that
promise,
the
informant
is
a
rat
and
i...
and
i
should
expose
him
and
such.
and
the...
and
the
reporter
then
went
out,
contrary
to
the
newspaper's
judgment,
and
revealed
the
identify.
would
the...
would
the
first
amendment
protect
the
reporter
against
damages,
too?
justice
souter
that's
right.
contrary
to
the
editorial
judgment
of
the
principal
for
whom
he
was
working
as
a...
as
a
disclosed
principal
for
whom
he
was
working.
