mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
minnesota
supreme
court
which
held
that
promises
of
confidentiality
from
newspapers
to
a
source
of
information
were
unenforceable
because
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
newspapers.
cohen
v.
cowles
media
presents
the
question
of
whether
newspapers
have
the
right
to
inflict
injuries
by
dishonoring
voluntary
promises
used
to
obtain
information.
honoring
promises
of
confidentiality
is
critical
in
ensuring
the
free
flow
of
information
to
the
public.
an
expert
witness
in
the
trial
to
this
case
testified
that
at
least
one-third
of
all
newspaper
stories
and
85
percent
of
news
magazine
stories
come
from
sources
promised
confidentiality
by
the
media
organizations
involved.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
because,
your
honor...
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
first
amendment
barred
enforceability
of
these
promises.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
really
raising
this
issue
to
point
out
the
first
amendment
values
that
are
involved
that
to
ensure
the
free
flow
of
information
to
the
public,
news
media
consider
it
necessary
to
make
these
promises
and
it's
also
necessary
to
keep
these
promises
to
avoid
drying
up
the
flow
of
information
from
sources.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
yes--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--yes,
justice
scalia--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--there
is
no
conflict
in
this
case.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
that
is
a
possible
resolution,
your
honor.
justice
scalia,
it's
been
the
position
of
the
trial
court
and
the
minnesota
court
of
appeals
and
also
of
course
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
the
first
amendment
simply
ought
not
to
allow
the
news
media
organizations
who
are
parties
to
this
case
to
break
promises
they
voluntarily
made
in
order
to
obtain
information,
that
the
media
organization
should
be
subject
to
the
same
law
as
everyone
else--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--every
other
business,
every
other
individual
in
keeping
their
promises.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
your
honor,
justice
kennedy,
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
would
violate
the
constitutional
provision
regarding
the
impairment
of
contracts.
if--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--future.
well,
we
don't
know
of
any...
it
would...
it
would
be
bad
public
policy...
it
would
be
our
position
that
this...
this
type
of
statute
ought
not
to
be--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--adopted.
it
would
be
the
equal
protection...
possibly
an
equal
protection
argument.
possibly--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--it
would
certainly
violate
values
of
the
first
amendment
that
would
be
involved
in
the--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--justice
kennedy,
it's...
that...
he
was
bringing
it
out
to
point
out
there
was
no
necessary
conflict
between
the
first
amendment
and
rules
of
contract
law
as
applied
to
this
case.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
seemed
to
believe
that
the
first
amendment
required
that
these
promises
not
be
enforceable.
it's
our
position
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
this.
and
not
only
that
but
that
there
are
certain
values
of
the
first
amendment
which
are
enhanced
by
promoting
these
promises...
by
honoring
these
promises
rather
than
allowing
newspapers
to
violate
these
promises
[inaudible].
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
in
minnesota,
your
honor,
promissory
estoppel
is
closely
related
to
the
law
of
contracts.
it
implies
a
contract
where
a
contact
might
not
otherwise
exist.
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
below.
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
discussed
this
issue...
pointed
out
that
promises
of
confidentiality
from
newspapers
to
sources
of
information
could
constitute
an
implied
contract
under
rules
of
promissory
estoppel.
but
then
went
on
to
say
that
such
a
promise
would
be
unenforceable
in
this
case
because
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
newspapers.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
it
isn't
necessary,
justice
o'connor,
in
minnesota,
to
specifically
plead
promissory
estoppel
apart
from
general
contract
law.
minnesota
is
a
notice
pleading
state.
and
in
this
case
before
the
court
and
in
another
case
which
was
cited
in
the
opinion
below,
the
christianson
v.
minneapolis
municipal
employees,
in
both
of
these
cases
the
parties
did
not
specifically
plead
or
argue
promissory
estoppel
or
implied
contract
as
distinct
from
conventional
contract--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--yes.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
uh-huh.
this...
your
honor,
there
is
no...
there
is
not
this
fine
or
close
distinction
between
implied
contracts
on
a
promissory
estoppel
or
conventional
contracts.
it's
based
upon
section
90
of
the
restatement
of
contracts.
and
in
both
this
case
and
the
christianson
case
where
in
fact
the
lower
court
held
against
the
plaintiff,
and
then
the
minnesota
supreme
court
reversed
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
an
implied
contract
through
promissory
estoppel
when
the
issue
had
not
been
raised
below.
so,
in
minnesota
state
practice,
it
is
possible
to
do
this
without
specifically
pleading
promissory
estoppel
as
apart
from
conventional
contract.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
well,
your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
plaintiff
did
not
ask
that
this
publication
be
enjoined.
plaintiff
asked
for
damages
for
the
violation
of
the
promise
made
by
the
newspapers.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
plaintiff
has
not
sought
an
injunction.
plaintiff
has
not--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--could
it
be
sought?
that
presents
the
issue
of
prior
restraint,
your
honor,
and
it
would
present
a
different
issue
than
damages.
no,
because
this
case
does
not
involve
any
attempt
for
prior
restraint
nor
would
i
think
any
principle
established
by
the
minnesota
court
of
appeals
or
the
trial
court
involve
any
issue
of
prior
restraint
on
publication
by
newspapers.
it
merely
involves
the
issue
of
whether
newspaper
should
be
liable
for
their
promises
and
whether
they
should
be
liable
for
damages
caused
by
violations
of
their
promises,
which
in
this
case
caused--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--it's...
it's--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--not
necessarily,
justice
scalia.
it's
our
position
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
even
reach
the
issue
of
prior
restraint.
it
merely
has
to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
recover
damages
for
a
violation--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--your
honor,
the
holding
of
the
case
from
the
minnesota
supreme
court
we
would
submit
was
purely
based
upon
the
first
amendment
where
it
says
towards
the
end
of
the
decision,
"we
conclude
that
the
enforcement
of
respondent's
promises
in
this
case
would
violate
that
first
amendment
rights--
"
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--except,
justice
souter,
that
was
not
the
arrangement
that
the
parties
had
made.
in
fact,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
pointed
out
itself
that
there
was
offer.
there
was
acceptance.
there
was
consideration.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
no,
your
honor,
justice
souter,
any
fair
reading
of
the
decision
would
lead
one
to
conclude
that
this
decision
was
in
fact
based
on
the
first
amendment
in
terms
of
the
promissory
estoppel
where
the
court
says
we
conclude
that
violation
of
these
promises
would
violate--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--would...
the
enforcement
of
the
promises
would
violate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
newspapers--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--justice
souter,
we
would
submit
that
that
would
not
be
the
case,
because
the
court,
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
did
find
it
necessary
to
examine
the
first
amendment
issues
and
to
make
that
specific
holding--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--well,
your
honor,
the
context
in
which
that
statement
was
made
wasn't
the
context
of
the
first
amendment
discussion.
that
was
about
a
sentence
or
two
after
they
pointed
out
that
this
case
presents
the
classic
first
amendment
situation
of
a
source
providing
information
in
connection
with
a
political
campaign
which
they
called
the
quintessential
first
amendment
situation.
and
then
they
said
that
we
think
that
in
this
situation,
the
law
best
leaves
the
parties
to
the
trust
in
each
other.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
if
the
one
statute
was
ostensibly
based
upon
the
first
amendment,
your
honor--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--that
would
present...
that
would
provide
jurisdiction
for
this
court,
justice
stevens,
to
consider
whether
the
first
amendment
actually
requires
that
the--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--i
would
submit
both,
your
honor.
that
in
fact,
as
is
pointing
out
the
beginning,
if
there
are
values
of
the
first
amendment
involved
in
this
case,
these
values
require
that
these
promises
be
honored
to
ensure
the
free
flow
of
information
to
the
public.
that's
what
the
minnesota
state
legislature
did
in
this
case.
in
fact,
getting
back
to
the
issue
of
the
statute,
it
would
be
one
thing
if
you
had
a
statute
saying
that
these
promises
are
unenforceable.
giving
notice
to
all
potential
sources
that
they
could
not
trust
promises
from
newspapers,
it
would
dry
up
these
sources.
i
would
assume
that
the
newspapers
themselves
would
not
support
such
a
statute.
in
this
type
of
situation,
a
solemn
promise
was
made
to
the
source,
mr.
cohen,
as
is
made
to
many
other
sources
on
a
daily
basis.
he
believed
that
he
could
trust
the
promise
of
the
reporter,
that
the
newspaper
would
honor
their
promises.
they
did
not
do
so.
he
had
no
notice
whatsoever.
had
he
had
that
notice,
he
wouldn't
have...
he
wouldn't
have
offered
the
information
to
the
newspapers,
he
wouldn't
have
trusted
the
promises,
and
this
case
wouldn't
have
arisen.
he
wouldn't
have
lost
his
job
as
a
result.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
yes,
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
in
other
cases
involving
court
orders
of
reporters
to
divulge
confidential
sources
before
grand
juries,
newspapers
and
other
media
organizations
have
taken
the
position--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--right.
but
the
positions
they
took
in
those
cases,
justice
stevens,
was
that
if
newspapers
are
forced
to
expose
their
sources
that
sources
will
dry
up,
that
the
public
will
be
deprived
of
important
information
it
now
gets
from
confidential
sources,
and
that
will
disserve
the
interest
of
the
first
amendment.
that's
exactly
the
position
they
took
in
the
branzburg
case
about
20
years
ago.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
well,
justice
stevens,
i
was
pointing
out
that
the
positions
of
the
media
have
been
inconsistent
on
this
issue.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
but
it's
been
our
position,
justice
stevens,
if
i
could
perhaps
answer
the
question
that,
as
in
the
minnesota
court
of
appeals...
the
first
amendment
really
ought
not
to
be
applicable
to
this
case.
you
have
a
private...
you
have
an
agreement
between
private
parties,
a
newspaper
and
a
source
of
information,
that
the
first
amendment...
there
was
no
governmental
compulsion
involved
in
this
case.
that
the
case
ought
to
be
decided
on
the
common
law,
on
issues
of
contract
state
law,
and
that
the
first
amendment
ought
not
to
be
a...
ought
not
to
be
interpreted
to
give
newspapers
or
other
media
organizations
a
right
to
violate
their
voluntary
promises
with
another
private
person.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
no,
justice
stevens,
because
the
problem
that
we
have
if...
if
you
open
the
door
for
state
courts
to
say
that,
although
we're
not
going
to
judge
a
case
on
the
amendment
or
the
constitutional
provision
itself,
we're
just
going
to
consider
the
policy
of
the
amendment
or
the
constitution,
that's
going
to
give
state
courts
the
opportunity
to
in
effect
reach
final
judgments
on
constitutional
issues
without
allowing
litigants
the
opportunity
to
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
your
honor,
that
issue
was
raised
in
the
oral
argument
before
the
minnesota
supreme
court
and
also
in
briefs
by
the
respondents,
particular
respondent
cowles
media
company.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
never
accepted
that
argument
at
that
time.
they
never
dealt
with
it.
and--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--but
it's...
your
honor,
again
we
take
the
position
that...
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
decision
itself,
which
is
of
course
all
we
have
to
act
upon,
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
did
not
refer
to
any
state
constitutional
provisions.
it
based
its
decision
saying
that
we
conclude
that
enforcing
these
promises
would
violate
the
newspapers'
rights
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
u.s.
constitution
and
refer
to
several
u....
united
states
supreme
court
cases
in
that
regard.
can
do...
to
continue,
many
arguments
were
made
in
the
briefs
on
the
applicability
of
the
first
amendment.
the
issue
generally
is...
comes
down
to
whether
a
private
agreement,
an
agreement
between
private
individuals,
a
newspaper
on
the
one
hand
and
a
source
of
information
on
the
other,
ought
to
implicate
the
first
amendment
at
all
and
whether
the
minnesota
supreme
court
acted
in
error,
as
we
submit
it
did,
in
holding
that
the
first
amendment
makes
these
promises
unenforceable,
because
we
have
here,
again,
a
private
agreement...
no
state
compulsion,
no
governmental
compulsion...
on
the...
forcing
the
newspapers
to
make
this
agreement
with
a
private
person.
but
as
a...
an
ordinary
business
practice
of
the
newspapers,
a
practice
that
is
indulged
in
frequently
by
all--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
submit
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
type
of
situation
and
this
type
of
case.
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
protected
a
newspaper
from
inadvertently
publishing
defamation
about
someone
else.
it
did
not
involved
a
situation
where
a
newspaper
made
an
agreement
with
a
private
person
to
obtain
information.
it
obtained
this
information
and
then
the
newspaper
decided
that
it
was
going
to
violate
the
agreement.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
except,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
again
involves
the
voluntary
agreement.
but
we
submit
there
are
many
other
ways
of
looking
at
the
issue
as
well.
for
example,
the
issue
of
waiver.
when
a
newspaper
makes
a
promise
of
confidentiality
to
a
news
source
or
makes
a
voluntary
promise
of
any
sort,
does
it
then
have
the
right
to
say
that
we're
going
to
violate
that
promise
because
we
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
do
that
so?
we
submit
that
once
that
promise
is
voluntarily
made,
the
newspaper
has
in
effect
waived
the
right
to
make
any
first
amendment
claim
of
a
right
to
violate
the
promise.
otherwise,
promises
of
newspapers
or
media
organizations
would
be
virtually
worthless,
not
only
to
news
source
confidentiality
but
at
any
individuals
or
businesses
that
newspapers
deal
with.
you
had
a
similar
type
of
situation
in
the
snepp
case
justice
scalia
mentioned
where
a
person
promised
not
to
publish
any
information
regarding
his
employment
at
the
cia
without
first
getting
the
approval.
he
broke
the
promise.
he
claimed
a
first
amendment
right
to
do
so.
the
court
ruled
that
he
couldn't
do
it...
in
fact,
establish
a
constructive
trust
on
all
the
profits
from
the
publication
in
that
case.
again...
so
in
the
other
issues
relating
to
this
is
whether
newspapers
should
have
the
right
to
violate
agreements,
should
be
subject
to
the
same
law
as
applied
to
everyone
else,
every
other
individual
or
every
other
business
who
makes
an
agreement
with
another
party.
should
newspapers
and
media
organizations
who
enter
into
such
agreements
willingly
in
exchange
for
other
types...
types
of
information
they
consider
valuable...
shouldn't
they
be
subject
to
the
same
law
as
applies
to
everyone
else
who
makes
voluntary
agreements
without
having
a
special...
without
being
given
a
special
first
amendment
right
to
violate
those
agreements?
finally,
in...
in
branzburg
v.
hayes,
the
journalist
argue
there
that
honoring
promises
of
confidentiality
were
so
important
to
first
amendment
values
as
to
require
constitutional
protection.
the
court
rejected
that
request
at
that
point
and
ruled
that
these...
the
first
amendment
was
simply
inapplicable
to
these
types
of
agreements.
this
court
should
not
now
accede
to
respond
its
demand
to
create
a
special
first
amendment
right
to
dishonor
their
agreements.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
time
for...
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
again:
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
on
rebuttal.
first
regarding
the
issue
of
whether
the
decision
below
was
based
on
the
first
amendment.
we
would
submit
that
any
fair
reading
indicates
that
in
fact
was
based
upon
the
first
amendment.
when
you
look
at
pages
a-12
to
a-14,
you
have
such
language
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
saying
we
have
not,
up
to
now,
had
to
consider
first
amendment
implications
but
now
we
must.
under
a
promissory
estoppel,
there
can
be
no
neutrality
towards
the
first
amendment.
the
court
must...
must
balance
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
free
press
against
the
common
law
interest
in
protecting
a
promise
of
anonymity,
and
says
that
of
critical
significance
to
this
case
is
the
fact
that
this
promise
was
made
in
a
classic
first
amendment
context
of
the
quintessential
public
debate
in
our
democracy.
and
finally
the
court
concluded
that
these
promises
were
unenforceable
because
of
the
first
amendment.
we
would
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
regarded
that
its
decision
was
required
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
regarding
the
issue
of
promissory
estoppel,
again,
under
this
decision,
and
under
the
christianson
decision
referred
to
in
the
decision
below,
that
under
minnesota
law
when
a
party
pleads
a
breach
of
contract
that
under
minnesota
law
that
court
can
decide
on
the
basis
of
promissory
estoppel,
which
basically
implies
a
contract,
that
state
law
of
minnesota.
and
finally
the
fact
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
consider
first
amendment
issues
is
sufficient
to
give
this
court
jurisdiction
under
the
several
cases
that
were
referred
to
in
the
briefs
under
our
longstanding
practice
by
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
french
says
that
the
issue
of
whether...
if
the
promise
is
kept...
this
is
going
to
prevent
the
publication
of
truth.
but
the
question
is
quite
different,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
obtain
the
truth
in
many
cases
up
to
75,
80
percent
of
the
cases
in
terms
of
certain
news
media,
their
media
organizations
must
make
these
promises
of
confidentiality
to
induce
sources
of
information
to
give
them
information.
without
these
promises,
they
would
not
have
the
truthful
information
to
convey
to
the
public.
the
public
would
be
deprived
of
information.
now,
that's
a
very--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
but
mr.
cohen,
as
many
other
confidential
sources,
felt
that
he
could
trust
the
promises
of
the
reporters.
he
felt
that
the
promises
would
be
honored,
and
therefore,
he
accepted
the
promises
of
the
reporters
in
this
case.
basically,
the
issue
is--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
yes,
justice
scalia,
on
that
one.
[laughter]
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to...
but
i
think
mr.
cohen
felt
that,
again,
he
could
trust
the
promises
that...
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
that
when
delivered
and
trusting
the
promises...
perhaps
we
carry
a
little
bit
more--
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
--your
honor,
the
issue
that
is
raised
by
justice
yetka
below,
where
he
pointed
out
that
the
real
issue
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
newspapers
made
a
promise
to
mr.
cohen.
mr.
cohen
relied
upon
that
promise
and
provided
information
that
the
newspapers
consider
valuable,
in
fact,
published
on
the
first
page
of
the
star
tribune
newspaper.
they
violated
their
promise
to
him.
as
a
result
of
their
violating
their
promises
to
them,
they
caused
him
damage...
considerable
damages
in
the
force...
in
the
form
of
getting
him
fired
from
his
job
and
subsequent
financial
damages.
any
other
person,
any
other
business,
any...
in
a
similar
situation
would
be
liable
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
justice
blackmun,
he
got
fired
from
his
job
precisely
because
of
the
newspaper
articles.
when
those
articles
came
out
the
next
day,
the
star
tribune
article
not
only
identified
mr.
cohen,
but
also
named
his
employer...
gratuitously
named
his
employer,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
elliot
c.
rothenberg
martin
williams
company,
a
major
minneapolis
advertising
company
which
of
course
does
work
for
political
figures
and
for
the
government.
they
felt
that
because
of
what
has
happened...
because
of
their
being
named...
that
they
had
to
fire
mr.
cohen,
and
that
of
course
is
found
by
the
jury
and
the
minnesota
court
of
appeals
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
pointed
out
in
their
decisions
that
this
is
no
longer
an
issue
in
the
case,
that
this
was
conceded
by
the
newspapers.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
