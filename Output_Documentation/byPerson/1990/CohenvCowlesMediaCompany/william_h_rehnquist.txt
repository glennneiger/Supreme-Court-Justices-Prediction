justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-634,
dan
cohen
v.
the
cowles
media
company,
doing
business
as
minneapolis
star
and
tribune
company.
mr.
rothenberg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
should
the
desirability
of
keeping
the
promise
of
confidentiality
on
the
part
of
a
media
organization
be
subject
to
our
decision
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
and
if...
if
the
minnesota
supreme
court
was
wrong
on
that
point,
we
would
say,
or
if
we
thought
so,
we
would
say
that
the
first
amendment
did
not
bar
the
enforcement
of
those
promises.
but
i
doubt
that
we
would
express
any
views
on
the
merits
as
whether
it's
desireable
as
to
public
policy
to
enforce
them
or
not.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
accord
them
any
special
protection
when
they
break
their
promises.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota,
if
we
were
to
reverse
its
judgment
here,
and
say
that
it
was
wrong.
it
had
passed
on
a
first
amendment
question
and
it
had
reached
the
wrong
result.
when
it
went
back,
it
could
say
that
the
supreme
court...
that
the
minnesota
constitution
required
the
same
result,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
maybe
they
were
saving
it
for
a
situation
like
the
one...
my
hypothetical.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
have
government
compulsion
just
as
you
have
in
a
liable
case,
don't
you?
i
mean
you...
you...
there's
no
government
compulsion
that
a
paper
print
a
story
about
someone
that
may
libel
them.
but
if
a
court
organized
by
the
government
gives
a
judgment
for
damages,
that's
sought...
thought
sufficient
to
invoke
the
first
amendment
to...
for...
invoke
the
new
york
times
against
sullivan
doctrine.
and
here,
too,
if
the
court
gives
a
judgment
for
damages,
that
is
sufficient
government
activity
i
would
think
to
raise
the
first
amendment
question
if
the
first
amendment
properly
applies.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
are
many
differences
i
agree.
but
i
don't
think
there's
a
difference
in
the
extent
of
government
involvement
in
the
two.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rothenberg.
mr.
french,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
french,
any
number
of
large
concerns
which
have
the
potential
for
doing
damage
to
people,
whether
they're
trucking
companies
or
products...
making
asbestos
and
newspaper
companies
have
the
potential
for
doing
damage
by...
have
to
live
with
a
certain
threat
of
litigation.
that's
part
of
doing
business
in
our
economy,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
you're
asking
us
to
vindicate
is
publication
of
the
truth
as
truth
is
determined
by
the
editors.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
surely
there's
a
strong
intimation
in
the
part
of
a
majority
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
dealing
with
promissory
estoppel
that
that
theory
could
sustain
the
judgment,
other...
otherwise
why
would
they
talk
about
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
tell
us
where
you're
reading
from,
mr.
french?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
french.
mr.
rothenberg,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothenberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-634
cohen
versus
cowles
media
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
