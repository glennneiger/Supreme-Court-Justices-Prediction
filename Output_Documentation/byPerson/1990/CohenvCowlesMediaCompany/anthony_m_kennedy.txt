justice
kennedy
well,
what
would
be
the
result
if
a
state
passed
a
statute
which
said,
as
a
matter
of
the
public
policy
of
this
state,
no
contract
in...
for
confidential
source
material
shall
be
enforceable?
what
result?
justice
kennedy
no,
no,
it
wouldn't,
because
it's
future.
justice
kennedy
well,
i...
it--
justice
kennedy
--would
there
be
a
first
amendment
problem?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
it
violates
values
of
the
first
amendment,
does
it
violate
the
first
amendment?
i'm
just
following
on
your
answers
to
justice
scalia
where
he
said,
well,
you're
taking
the
position
that
the
first
amendment
requires
it.
justice
kennedy
well,
are
you...
again,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
result
would
be
any
different
if
it
weren't...
just
a
low-level
news
story
which
may
or
may
not
be
in
the
public
interest...
no
public
officials
involved?
it's
the
same
principle,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
in
that
light
was
it
wrong
for
the
newspaper
reporter
to
guarantee
confidentiality?
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
newspaper
reporter
had
known
that
her
editor
would
countermand
her
promise,
and
made...
but
the
newspaper
reporter
made
the
promise
anyway?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
it's
the
degree
of
wrong,
the
egregiousness
of
the
press
misrepresentations
that
controls
the
case?
justice
kennedy
how
would...
how
should
the
case
come
out,
the
case
that
i
put
to
you?
justice
kennedy
it's
a
very
odd
calculus
that
the
person
closest
to
the
truth...
in
this
case
the
source...
cannot
protect
his
ability
to
divulge
or
not
to
divulge
but
that
as
you
get
further
away
from
the
sources
of
truth,
i.e.,
in
the
newspaper
room,
you
say,
oh,
then
the
newspaper
has
a
right
to
protect
its
information
by
a
contract
suit.
i...
it
seems
to
me
the
calculus
should
be
just
the
other
way
around.
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
supreme
of
arizona...
of
minnesota
has
said,
we
don't
think
there's
any
protection
for
newspapers
for
confidential
sources,
and
therefore,
we
apply
promissory
estoppel.
could
you
have
appealed?
justice
kennedy
well,
isn't
it
the
same
principle?
justice
kennedy
does...
does
it
make
it
easier
for
you
to
answer
if
we
assume
also
that
the
newspaper
is
liable
for
the
misdeeds
of
its
agents,
so
you're
stuck
for
the
damages.
does
that
change
your
answer?
justice
kennedy
yes,
because
of
the
misdeeds
of
its
agent.
justice
kennedy
i
don't...
and...
but
the
reporter
is?
justice
kennedy
but
most
of
all
when
it's
the
newspaper
that's
involved.
justice
kennedy
but
you're
not
sure
as
to
what
happens
with
the
reporter.
you're
also
not
sure
as
to
what
happens
in
the
hypothetical
of
where
the
reporter
deliberately
misleads,
knowing
that
his
promise
is
going
to
be
countermanded.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
very,
very
difficult
position.
we're
asking
what
the
first
amendment
consequences
are--
justice
kennedy
--and
you
haven't...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
haven't
explained
this
in
a
coherent
theory.
