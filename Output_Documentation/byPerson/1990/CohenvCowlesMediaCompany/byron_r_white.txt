justice
white
well,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
that
you're
going
to
make
if
the
contract
was
in
writing
and
there
was
consideration
on
both
sides?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
because
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
white
and
so
you
think
this...
we
really
do
have
a
first
amendment
question
before
us?
justice
white
and
that
the...
when
we...
and
that
the
we
certainly
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
it,
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
only
been
argued
now
is
that...
is
that
the...
is
that
the
paper
has
a
first
amendment
right
not
to
live
up
to
this
contract.
i
don't...
i
don't
know
why
you're
arguing
it
if
the
issue
isn't
here.
justice
white
why
don't
you...
why
don't
you
tell
us
why
we
don't
have
to
decide
it?
justice
white
tell
us
why
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
it.
justice
white
well,
that's
always
usually
the
first
part
of
a
question.
justice
white
no,
it
was
the
court
talking
about
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
and
they
talked
about
it.
i
wouldn't
think
that
there
was
any
principle
of
minnesota
law
that
would
prevent
them
from
doing
that.
we'd
have
to
second-guess
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
and
they've...
the
court
said
we
decide
that...
because
we
decide
that
contract
law
does
not
apply,
we
have
not
up
'til
now
had
to
consider
the
first
amendment
implications,
but
now
we
must.
justice
white
under
a
promissory
estoppel
analysis
there
can
be
no
neutrality
towards
the
first
amendment.
then
they
said...
they
just
held
that
to
uphold...
to
enforce
the
promise
under
a
promissory
estoppel
would
violate
the
defendant's
first
amendment
rights.
justice
white
i
would
think
you're
defending
that...
you've
been
defending
that
judgment
most
of
the
morning.
justice
white
by
the
way
did
you
defend
in
the
trial
court
on
the
grounds
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
white
was
it...
was
it
because
there
was
no
state
action?
was
that...
was
that
the
ground?
justice
white
well,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
no...
first
amendment
was
out
of
the
case
because
there
was
no
state
action.
justice
white
what
your
view
about
the
state
action
issue?
justice
white
well,
that's
because...
it's
because
it's
a...
would
involve
a
claim
of
damages
against
the
paper.
justice
white
thank
you.
mr.
french,
judge
yetka's
dissent
at
least
seemed
to
think
that
the
decision
of
the
majority
of
the
court
was
based
upon
the
first
amendment.
and
his
dissent
was
joined
by
the
other
dissenter,
justice
kelley.
he
said
the
first
amendment
is
being
misused
to
avoid
liability
under
the
doctrine
of
promissory
estoppel.
justice
white
what
page
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
for
reasons
that
are
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
and
remand
the
case.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
he
is
joined
by
justices
marshall
and
souter.
justice
souter
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justices
marshall,
blackmun,
and
o'connor
had
joined
his
opinion.
