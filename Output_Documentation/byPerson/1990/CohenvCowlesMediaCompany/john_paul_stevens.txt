justice
stevens
it
said
that
because
the
members
of
the
legislature
are
all
convinced
that
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment,
we
therefore
enact
this
statute.
justice
stevens
did
we
review
the
reasoning
that
the
legislators
adopt,
do
we?
or
do
we
review
the
end
product
of
their
work?
justice
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
of
course
in
the
future
the
law
will
be
clearer
if
this
is
affirmed.
the
future
is...
will
be
as
though
a
statute
like
this
was
on
the
books.
justice
stevens
yes,
we
haven't
always
agreed
with
them,
though.
justice
stevens
you
seem
to
be
posing
the
issue
as
whether
we...
which
result
we
think
will
maximize
the
flow
of
information.
we
should
pick
one
result
or
the
other
on
the
basis
of
our
judgment
as
to
which
one
will
increase
the
flow
of
information.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
very
few
litigants
come
here
who
haven't
taken
other
positions
from
time
to
time.
justice
stevens
well,
but
the
maximum
your...
result
you
can
achieve
here
is
not
just
that
we
remand
it
to
the
court
of...
the
minnesota
supreme
court
and
say,
you're
really
not
required
to
reach
this
result
by
the
first
amendment.
but
you
can
reach
the
same
result
because
you
believe
in
the
policy
of
the
first
amendment.
that
would
all
right,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
what
is
public
significance?
about
the
candidate
or
about
the
person
who
gave
the
information?
justice
stevens
so
that
you
could
have
published
the
information
that
she'd
been
arrested
or
whatever
it
was
and
that
would
have
satisfied
that
requirement
without
identifying
the
source,
couldn't
you?
justice
stevens
apparently,
that
indicates
that
reasonable
news
editors
could
differ
as
to
the
public
significance
of
the
information.
justice
stevens
and
we
should
say...
we
should
choose
between
the
two
views
on
that.
justice
stevens
no,
but
you're
saying
that
you
sort
have
got
a
heightened
scrutiny,
because
it
is
a
matter
of
public
significance,
not
that
whenever
editors
may
differ
as
to
whether
it's
a
matter
of
public
significance,
then
you
get
the
heightened
scrutiny
or
is
that
your
point?
justice
stevens
such
as
there
was
involved
in
the
snepp
case.
justice
stevens
he
had
to
pay
the
consequences
for
what
he
did.
but
you...
this
is
not
a
prepublication
case.
you
could
go
ahead
and
publish
and
pay
damages
and
publish
anything
you
wanted
to.
justice
stevens
it's
still
something
that
he
could
weigh
in
the
balance
when
they
decide
whether
or
not
to
breach
their
agreement.

[laughter]
justice
stevens
yes,
mr.
french,
but
the
next
sentence
they
use
the
word
"must".

[laughter]
justice
stevens
well,
how
can
you
say
it
would
be
very...
he
goes
to
another
newspaper
and
sells
the
information
and
they
publish
it.
justice
stevens
yes,
you're
exactly...
you
get
exactly
the
same
situation,
don't
you?
