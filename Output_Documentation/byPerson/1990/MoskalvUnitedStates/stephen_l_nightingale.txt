mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
washed
automobile
titles
constitute
falsely
made
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
2314.
our
position
is
that
they
are,
for
essentially
three
reasons.
first,
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
falsely
made
securities
fits
those
documents.
second,
that
interpretation
accords
with
the
history
and
purpose
of
this
statute.
and
third,
there
are...
is
no
canon
of
construction
that
would
justify
imputing
an
artificially
narrow
interpretation.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
the
making
of
a
automobile
title
involves
the
incorporation
of
information
from
the
prior
title,
plus
some
additional
information
supplied
by
the
new
purchaser
to
state
authorities.
they
then
return
a
new
title
incorporating
the
information.
a
washed
automobile
title
is
falsely
made
because
that
process
is
corrupted
through
the
addition
of
false
information,
and
the
end
product,
the
virginia
title
bearing
false
odometer
figure,
is
indistinguishable
in
substance
from
the
classic
forgery,
a
situation
in
which
you
get
a
purportedly
valid
document
that
is
capable
of
being
used
to
mislead
used
car
purchasers.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
there
may
be
a
limit
on
the
statute
for
materiality.
i
mean,
if
you
made
a
mark
on
an
automobile
title
that
had
no
effect
on
it,
whatever,
that
might
not
violate
the
statute.
but
the
color
of
the
car
i
don't
think
would
fall
within
the
de
minimis
situation.
that
would
be
a
means
by
which,
if
for
example
it
was
a
stolen
car,
someone
could
mislead
the
purchaser
as
to
the
true
identity
of
the
car.
but
i
believe
that
a
false
addition
or
an
introduction
of
a
falsity
through
this
process--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--the
name
of
the
seller
would
qualify,
because
it
would
prevent
the
purchaser
from
being
in
touch
with
him
to
find
out
the
history
of
the
car.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
i
would
in
this
sense,
that
if
you
had
a
valid
title
and
the
only
alteration
was
the
addition
of
a
pencil
mark
on
it,
i
guess
it
would
be
altered
in
some
sense.
but
it
would
be
completely
immaterial.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that
is
a
general
principle,
yes,
your
honor,
but
it's...
it's
one
that
has
some
important
limitations
as
well.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the
term
falsely
made
at
common
law
drew
a
distinction
between
false
in
execution
and
false
in
content.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
now,
there
were
fictions
developed
because
that
line
was
not
entirely
satisfactory.
i
agree
that
none
of
the
fictions
present
in
1934
would
have
covered
the
virginia
title,
but
it's
important
to
recognize
that
they
existed.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
at
common...
under
the
old
common
law
term.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
in
this
case
the
option
was
available,
because
mr.
moskal
was
both
the
sender
and
the
receiver.
he
was
at
both
ends.
but
i
want
to
add,
in
light
of
the
court's
questions
about
the
significance
of
this
case,
that
that
is
by
no
means
a
certainty
in
these
cases.
there
are
many
cases
in
which...
potential
cases
one
can
visualize
in
which
a
different
person
sends
the
altered
documents
one
way,
then
receives
them
on
the
return
trip.
and
there
may
also
be
problems--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--in
some
of
them,
right,
but
in
this
case
the
evidence
demonstrated
that
the
documents
were
sent
by
federal
express,
and
in
some
cases
hand
carried.
and
the
prevailing
rule
in
the
courts
of
appeals
right
now
is
that
federal
express
does
not
qualify
as
a
use
of
the
mails.
so
that
was
not
an
available
option
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
there
were--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--in
the
context
that
this
statute
operates
it
is
not
a
reasonable
interpretation.
i
would...
i
want
to
point
out
as
well
that--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--let
me
indicate...
let
me
refer
to
a
case
decided
8
years
ago
by
the
court,
bell
v.
united
states,
in
which
the
question
was
whether
a
statute
that
prohibits
people
from
taking
and
carrying
away
money
from
a
bank
was
designed
to
extend
beyond
common
law
larceny.
now,
those
words
had
a
distinct
common
law
ring
to
them,
and
the
question
was
did...
did
congress,
when
it
enacted
a
statute
prohibiting
taking
and
carrying
away
money,
mean
to
incorporate
all
of
the
common
law
limitations.
in
general
the
common
law
required
that
the
taking
be
from
the
possession
of
the
owner
rather
than
the
acquisition
of
title.
and
the
court
found
that
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
was
designed
to
protect
banks
from
losing
money,
the
distinction
between
title
and
possession
made
no
sense
whatever.
and
essentially
that
is
our
position
in
this
case.
in
the
context
of
securities
there
is
no
difference
in
substance
between
a
document
run
off
an
illicit
printing
press
with
a
false
odometer
reading
and
a
document
prepared
by
means
of
the
scheme
that
mr.
moskal
and
his
confederates
followed.
the
question
is
in
the
context
that
congress
acted,
did
the
statute...
would
the
distinction
drawn
by
the
common
law
make
sense.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
in
fact
in
the
common
law
there
was
difficulty
with
your
proposition.
there
is
a
case
cited
in
our
brief,
count
de
toulouse
lautrec,
in
footnote
10
of
our
brief
on
page
17.
the
facts
there
were
that
a
printing
company
printed
securities
for
a
corporation,
printed
a
few
extra
copies
for
its
own
files
by
way
of
samples
of
its
work.
the
defendant
obtained
the
samples
and
negotiated
them
as
valid
bonds.
and
that
defendant
was
convicted
of
forgery.
the
court
found
that
where
there
was
no
authority
to
use
the
documents
in
that
fashion
there
was
a
forgery.
there
was
another
case,
one
not
cited
in
our
brief,
commonwealth
v.
foster
out
of
massachusetts
in
around
the
1870's.
in
that
case
the
defendant
called
in
a
gentleman
who
had
the
same
name
as
a
rather
well
known
commercial
firm,
had
him
sign
some
notes
in
his
wilson
&
co.,
by
mr.
wilson,
and
then
that
person
took
the...
of
course
mr.
wilson
was
not
a
party
to
the
fraud.
the
defendant
took
those
notes
out
and
represented
them
to
be
the
notes
of
the
large
commercial
outfit.
and
again
there
the
court
held
that
that
qualified
as
forgery.
this
is
illustrative,
your
honor,
of
the
sorts
of
distinctions
and
difficulties
that
were
present
in
the
common
law
at
the
time
congress
was
called
upon
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
falsely
made
production
of
securities.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
if
there
were
an
indication
that
that
meaning
could
be
attributed
to
congress
as
a
whole,
yes,
your
honor.
those
circumstances
aren't
present
here.
let
me
review,
if
i
could,
the
history
of
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
let
me...
i
don't
believe
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
this
statute,
in
its
context,
for
which
legislative
history
would
be
helpful
in
clarifying,
no.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
it
was
passed
in
1939,
your
honor.
essentially
the
history
was
as
follows.
in
1934
the
attorney
general
sent
a
series
of
bills--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--not
that
i
am
aware
of.
there
is
one--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--the
justice
department
has
not
made...
the
justice
department
has
not
made
an
effort
to
clarify
it.
maybe
i
should
back
up
and
review
the
history
of
this
statute.
in
1934
attorney
general,
the
attorney
general
sent
a
set
of
bills
to
the
hill,
all
of
which
had
as
their
common
purpose
the
creation
of
federal
criminal
penalties
for
criminal
activity
that
extended
across
state
lines.
congress
enacted
those
bills,
recognizing
that
interstate
criminal
activity
is
more
difficult
to
detect,
it
is
more
difficult
to
prosecute,
threatens,
in
a
large
number
of
cases,
more
serious
harm
to
the
individuals.
as
originally
enacted
that
bill,
the
national
stolen
property
act,
prohibited
the
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
securities;
5
years
later
congress
extended
the
prohibition
by
adding
a
separate
paragraph
including
falsely
made
securities.
and
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
congress'
intention
in
enacting
the
extension
was
its
recognition
that...
of
the
difficulty
of
detecting
and
apprehending
offenders
and
prosecuting
those
sorts
of
offenses.
there
is
no
distinction
in
terms
of
that
context,
and
i
recall
bell
again,
where
the
purpose
was
to
protect
the
assets
of
banks.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the
jury
was
not
instructed
on
a
theory
that
would
have--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--yes,
it
is
our
position
that
there
could
be
jury
instructions
that
would
encompass
the
sort
of
activity
i
spoke
of
with
justice
scalia.
the
last
footnote
in
our
brief
indicates
that
we
believe
that
were
the
court
to
reverse
the
conviction,
the
proper
disposition
would
be
a
remand
for
a
new
trial
in
which
forgery
would
be
defined.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
is
as
follows.
a
check
signed
by
an
agent,
purportedly
for
a
principal,
in
which
the
agent
has
no
authority
is
at
common
law
not
a
forgery.
the
reasoning
behind
that
is
that
that
check
is
made
by
the
person
purporting...
is
endorsed
by
the
person
purporting
to
make
it.
it
contains,
though,
only
a
false
representation,
which
is
that
the
agent
had
authority
to
act
for
the
principal.
in
my
judgment
that
would
quality
as
a
falsely
made
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
no.
counterfeiting
is
a
subset
of
forged.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
i
don't
believe
that
we
need
view
this
statute
as
a
series
of
independent
boxes
for
the
government
to
prevail.
i
do
believe
that
when
you
consider
this
statute
in
the
context
of
its
passing,
you...
you
are
justified
in
recognizing
the
fuzziness
at
the
edges
of
the
definition
of
forgery.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
again
harkening
back
to
the
bell
case,
the
words
take
and
carry
away
have
both
an
ordinary
meaning
and,
as
my
colleague
indicates,
they
have
a
term-of-art
meaning.
the
common
ordinary
meaning
is
when
you
go
into
a
bank
without
money
and
you
come
out
with
money,
that
is
taking
it
and
carrying
away.
the
common
law
term-of-art
meaning
was
that
when
you
go
into
a
bank
without
money
you
have
to
get
it
by
means
of
a
scheme
that
involves
depriving
the
victim
of
possession.
and
i
think
that
the
same
can
be
said
of
this
situation.
if
we
walked
out
through
those
doors
and
asked
100
people
in
the
street
whether
there
was
a
difference
in
substance
between
the
documents
that
mr.
moskal
sent
to
virginia
and
those
that
came
back,
100
people
would
fail
to
perceive
that.
they
would
all
recognize
that
the
corruption
of
the
process
of
making,
through
the
introduction
of
the
falsity,
made
those
documents
falsely
made.
now
it
is
true
that
at
common
law
those
words
had
a
somewhat
narrower
meaning.
they
entailed
a
basic
distinction
which,
as
i
have
indicated,
was
somewhat
riddled
with
fiction,
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
truth
in
the
execution
and
truth
in
content.
but
i
believe
that
there's
a
situation
there
where
we
have
a
common
ordinary
meaning
that
can
be
given
effect
by
the
court
in
the
context
of
this
statute.
again,
without
harping
on
it,
it's
fair
to
point
out
that
mr.
moskal's
confederates
were
paying
the
people
in
virginia
$100
to
convert
the
altered
documents
into
washed
documents.
they
recognized
that
not
only
were
they
equally
deceptive,
but
they
were
significantly
more
deceptive
enough
to
justify
the
$100
a
shot.
and
in
that
situation,
and
given
the
common
ordinary
understanding
of
falsely
made,
there
is
no
justification
for
reverting
back
to
what
we
submit
are
arcane,
obsolete
distinctions
without
meaning
in
this
context.
i
do
want
to
call
attention
to
one
subsequent
enactment
that
bears
on
the
problem
before
the
court.
in
1984
congress
amended
the
definition
of
security
to
which
this
statute
applies
to
include
valid
or
blank
automobile
titles.
the
legislative
history
is
very
sparse
on
this.
the
one
indicator
of
congress'
intention
was
a
committee
report
directed
to
the
same
bill
in
a
prior
congress,
but
the
indication
is
that
congress
believed
that
valid
titles
were
already
covered
by
the
statute.
the
amendment
was
needed
to
add
blank
titles
to
those
sorts
of
securities
that
could
be
transported.
it
is
clear
though
that
in
1984
congress
understood
there
to
be
such
a
thing
as
a
falsely
made,
forged,
counterfeited,
or
altered
valid
automobile
title.
and
it
is
our
position
that
one
cannot
conceive
of
a
forged,
counterfeited,
or
altered
valid
automobile
title.
there
has
to
be
something
for
the...
that
operates
on
the
term
valid,
and
we
believe
it
is
falsely
made.
this
court
has--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
this
court--
--then
what
does
it,
then
what
is
the
purpose
of
that?
just
to
show
that
congress
misunderstood
it
or
understood
it
correctly,
one
or
the
other.
there
was
no
alteration
in
1984.
in
1984
congress
by
action
[inaudible]
its
position.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--'39,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
the
court
has
often
indicated
that
subsequent
interpretations
of
a
statute
by
congress,
though
not
dispositive,
are
entitled
to
significant
weight.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
it's
not
just
the
legislative
history.
it
is
the
action.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
congressmen
got
up
in
committee
hearings
and
said
we
believe
that
this
statute
we
passed
3
years
ago
meant
x.
in
this
case
the
congress
as
a
whole
passed
a
statute
that
makes
sense
only
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
valid
automobile
title
that
can
violate
section
2314.
and
i
think
the
closest
parallel
that
i
was
able
to
find
is
the
red
lion
case.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
fcc
had
promulgated
a
rule
adopting
the
fairness
doctrine.
there
was
question
about
whether
the
commission
had
authority
to
do
that,
and
a
subsequent
piece
of
legislation,
congress
amended
the
fcc
act
and
noted...
provided
however
that
this
amendment
is
not
intended
to
alter
the
obligation
that
in
effect
broadcasters
have
under
the
fairness
doctrine.
the
court
relied
very
heavily
on
that
as
an
indication
that
congress
believed
the
fcc
had
the
authority
before
to
issue
the
doctrine.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
yes.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
state
that
issued
it
would
not
believe
it
was
a
valid
automobile
title,
but--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--it's
not
the
same
title
that
was
issued
by
the
state.
it
doesn't
validly--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
the
reason
it's
a
difficult
question
to
answer,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
what...
that
the
situation
that
you
have
in
mind
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
the
difficulty
in
answering--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
let's
focus
a
little
bit
on
what
automobile
titles
do,
and
then
i
think
it
will
become
clear
why
i
am
having
difficulty
with
the
question.
states
have
attached
different
significance
to
automobile
titles.
in
some
states
a
title
is
the
exclusive
means
by
which
you
can
pass
title
to
a
car.
if
you
buy
my
car
but
i
don't
give
you
the
title,
i
sell
it
to
someone
else,
he
gets
it.
in
other
states
titles
are
prima
facie
evidence
of
ownership,
but
the...
the
transaction
involves
the
sale
of
the
car,
and
the
evidence
is
altered
to
reflect
the
real
transaction.
in
that
context,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
we
are
cut
loose
in
many
states
from
the
concept
that
the
title
is
needed
to
pass
title
as
such.
the
validity
of
the
title,
it
seems
to
me,
refers
to
the
title
being
in
its,
in
the
condition
that
it
had
when
it
is
issued
by
state
authorities.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
way
that
would
be
handled
in
the
rules
of
evidence
would
be
to
say
that
it
would
go
to
the
weight
assigned
to
the
argument,
but
not
to
the
correctness
of
the
argument.
i
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary
to
exclude
all
possibilities.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the...
again,
looking
at
it
in
the
context...
let
me
say
that
the
1984
legislation
that
added
this
provision
was
designed
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
washing
and
changing
titles
to
deal
with
stolen
cars
primarily,
although
there
was
indication
of
odometer
fraud
as
well.
the
committees
that
were
dealing
with
the
problem
were
told
that
a
good
way
to
title
a
stolen
car
would
be
to
get
a
hold
of
an
automobile
title,
alter
the
identification
number
to
match
the
one
of
the
car
that
had
been
stolen,
wash
that
title,
and
then
end
up
with
an
apparently
valid...
validly
titled
document.
and
i
believe
that
when
congress
enacted
the
legislation
making
it
a...
making
a
valid
title
one
that
could
be
the
subject
of
2314,
it
was
intending
to
deal
with
the
same
aspects
of
that
kind
of
fraud
and
scheme
that
we
have
before
us
today.
and
that
they
had
evidence
before
them
of...
congress
had
evidence
before
it
of
this
type
of
operation,
altered
only
in
the
fact
that
the
identification
number
was
altered
rather
than
the
odometer
reading.
so
i
believe
it
is
a
fair
inference.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
do
that.
i
believe
the
classic
statement
of
the
rule
of
lenity
is
justice
blackmun's
in
the
huddleston
case
in
415
u.s.
there
are
two
reasons
for
the
rule
of
lenity
in
effect.
one
reason
is
to
give
fair
notice
to
individuals.
the
second
is
to
be
sure
that
legislatures
define
crimes
and
not
courts.
and
the
rule
is
subject
to
the
important
qualification
that
although
penal
laws
are
to
be
strictly
construed,
they
ought
not
to
be
construed
so
strictly
as
to
defeat
the
obvious
intention
of
the
legislature.
i
submit
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
neither
of
the
underpinnings
of
the
rule
of
lenity
are
applicable.
mr.
moskal
was
not
endowed
as
to
the
illegality
of
his
conduct,
and
if
he
had
given
any
attention
to
section
2314,
i
submit
that
looking
at
the
common
ordinary
meaning
of
falsely
made,
he
would
not
have
believed
that
he
would
have
been
free...
not
free
to
send
the
documents
down,
but
free
to
receive
them
back.
in
the
context
that
this
statute
operates,
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
congress
was
acting
against
an
evil,
the
interstate
transportation
of
falsely
made
securities,
which
fully
covers
this
situation.
it
would
be
highly
inconsistent
with
congress'
intention
to
exclude
from
this
statute
a
scheme,
the
essence
of
which
was
the
use
of
interstate
transportation--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
there
was
dispute
on
that
question,
your
honor.
the
goucher
and
corfield
cases
in
footnote
9
of
our
brief,
even
a
corrupt
official
could
not
forge
an
official
document.
under
the
hibbs
and
wilson
cases--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--the...
those
cases
did
not
distinguish
between
falsely
made
and
forgery.
under
the
hibbs
and
wilson
cases
though,
that
was
a
forgery.
it's...
it's
our
belief
that
congress
meant
not
to,
meant
to
go
beyond
that
dispute.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
the
end
product
is
a
document
which
is
falsely
made
because
false
information
has
been
introduced
into
it
in
the
process
of
its
making.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
right.
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
intent
to
defraud,
and
made
the
interstate
transportation
knowing
of
the
falsely
made
document.
those
are
the
two
mental
elements
of
this
statute,
and
they
are
fully
satisfied.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
i
don't
think
a
jury
could
find
that
that
gentleman
had
the
intent
to
defraud
that
is
required
for
this
statute.
the
statute
prohibits...
covers
whoever
with
unlawful
or
fraudulent
intent
transports
in
interstate
commerce,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
