claim
that
you
have
to
give
some
meaning
to
this
provision,
and
it
hasn't
any
meaning
if
it
really...
if
we
accept
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
it
has
really
no
meaning.
unknown
speaker
don't
we
usually
follow
the
principle
that
each...
each
word
or
sentence
or
phrase
of
a
law
is
supposed
to
be
given
an
independent
meaning
so
that
it
won't
be
simply
superfluous?
unknown
speaker
like
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hart,
may
i
ask
whether
there
is
any
other
statutory
provision
under
which
your
client
could
have
been
charged
for
transporting
these
virginia
certificates?
unknown
speaker
what
might
that
be?
unknown
speaker
could
mr.
moskal
have
been
charged
under
section
2314
with
regard
to
the
pennsylvania
certificates?
unknown
speaker
just
not
the
virginia
titles.
unknown
speaker
but
he
wasn't
charged
with
transporting
those?
unknown
speaker
is
this
whole
case
just
a
tempest
in
a
teapot
then?
if
we
decide
for
you
the
government
isn't
hurt,
because
it
could
have
charged
him
with
transporting
the
pennsylvania
certificates.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
for
you,
if
you
win
you
are
still...
your
client
or
people
like
him
are
still
going
to
be
subject
to
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
not
prosecution
under
a...
under
a
regiment
such
as
virginia's.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
subject
to
federal
prosecution
under
a
licensing
scheme
such
as
that
of
virginia.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
why
can
he
be
charged
under
your
theory
with
the
pennsylvania
titles
but
not
the
virginia
titles?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
virginia...
how
would
you
describe
those
washed
certificates?
forged?
unknown
speaker
falsely
made?
unknown
speaker
altered?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
you
be
prosecuted
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
not
the
virginia,
the
pennsylvania
titles.
unknown
speaker
yes,
well
all
right,
so
he
could
have
been
charged
under
2314--
unknown
speaker
--for
sending
those
in
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
getting
down
to
then
is
merely
prosecutorial
error,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
maybe
we'll
find
out...
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
did
you
indicate
at
the
outset
that
you
think
the
terms
forged
and
falsely
made
may
have
a
different
meaning?
unknown
speaker
yes
and
no.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
different
meaning?
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
where
a
document
is
not
forged
but
it
is
falsely
made?
unknown
speaker
well,
those
are
forged,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
i
would
be
very
surprised
to
see
that
that
is
not
forgery.
and
your
bribery,
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
that
works.
unknown
speaker
i
think
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
falsely
made,
if
it
does
not
mean
the
same
thing
as
forged,
altered,
or
counterfeited,
at
least
means
that
the
person
who
makes
it
must
know
that
he
is
falsely
making
it.
unknown
speaker
so
the
bribery
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
point
is
that
if
the
person
who
makes
it
is
not
being
false,
if
he
thinks
it's
accurate,
you
would
not
consider
that
falsely
made.
unknown
speaker
whereas
if
the
official
himself
knows
he
is
writing
down
something
that
is
in
error,
he
would
be
making
it
falsely.
but
how
does
that
help
you?
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
and
you
assert
that
that
helps
your
case
by
giving
some
different
meaning
to
falsely
made,
if
a
different
meaning
is
required.
and
that
is
your
other
position,
that
a
different
meaning
isn't
required
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
mr.
hart,
the
statute
itself
says
"knowing
the
same
to
have
been
falsely
made."
as
an
additional
requirement.
what
is
the
sense
of
reading
that
language
into
one
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute?
how
does
that
help
make
it
clear?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
just
said
that
you
agreed
with
justice
scalia's
hypothesis?
unknown
speaker
but
the
knowingly,
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
so
and
so
applies
to
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
case.
unknown
speaker
not
to
some
state
official
who
may
or
may
not
know
that
this
instrument
is
falsely
made.
unknown
speaker
because
the
virginia
people
didn't
know
that
there
was
anything
phony
about
this
whole
deal,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
had...
what
if
the
virginia
guy
was
in
on
it?
then
i
think
you
would
think,
you
would
say
it
was
falsely
made.
unknown
speaker
they
were
falsely
made.
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
official
preparing
and
issuing
the
document
has
knowledge
of
the
falsity
and
intends
thereby
that
people
be
deceived
by
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position
now?
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
changed
your
position
a
little
bit,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
why
that
makes
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
because
the
odometer
reading
is
an
important
material
part
of
the
piece
of
paper,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
is
just
put
in
for
the
fun
of
it?
unknown
speaker
maybe
not,
or
what
about
the
name
of
the
former
owner?
why
is
that
important
to
a
purchaser?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
the
statute
on
titles
requires
the
odometer
reading
to
be
put
in,
i
presume
it
wants
an
accurate
one,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
sure,
and
there
are
separate
laws
that
make
it
an
offense
to
forge
documents,
too.
we
are
talking
about
an
offense
of
transporting
certain
kinds
of
documents
in
interstate
commerce,
documents
that
are
equivalent
to
false
documentary
evidence.
and
that
is
what
this
is,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
it
would
pass
even
if
you
had
a
forged
signature
of
the
owner,
you
had
a
forged
name...
you
have
all
sorts
of
forgery
on
that
title
and
it
will
still
pass.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
if
someone
could
come
in
and
prove
that
the
seller
lied
about
the
odometer
reading
he
could
rescind
the
transaction?
unknown
speaker
are
you
telling
me
that
it's
important
to
have
the
name
of
the
person
who
owned
the
car?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
important
to
the
purchaser?
unknown
speaker
because
my
next
question
is
the
odometer
interesting
to
the
purchaser?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
what
was
changed
on
this
one.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
was
changed
on
this
one.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
make
sure
that--
--[inaudible].
are
you
talking
about
material
misrepresentations
when
you
are
discussing,
such
as
you
could
set
aside
the
thing
that
is
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller,
or
something
that
would
enable...
enable
a
bona
fide
purchaser
to
prevail?
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
materiality
in
the
sense
of
is
this
particular
representation
important
to
a
possible
purchaser?
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
to
be.
that
surely
the
representation
of
the
odometer
reading
is
important
to
a
potential
purchaser,
if
that
means
anything
in
construing
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
invalid
document.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
the
question
is
is
it
falsely
made?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
your
position
that
if
in
pennsylvania
they
altered
the
certificate
to
show
a
different
year
of
car,
different
odometer
reading,
different
owner,
and
then
it
was
washed
in
virginia,
that
it
is
falsely
made
because
there
are
some
materials...
misstatements?
it
seems
to
me
you
are
switching
your
argument,
that
all
of
a
sudden
you
conceded
that
materiality
is
the
test.
unknown
speaker
so
that
even
if...
suppose
there's
no
car
at
all,
and
you
have
a
pennsylvania
certificate
that
is
forged,
falsely
made
to
show
that
there
was,
and
then
it
is
washed
in
virginia.
and
the
title
comes
back,
or
the
certificate
comes
back
purporting
to
be
an
authentic
virginia
certificate.
falsely
made?
unknown
speaker
that
has
to
be
your
position.
unknown
speaker
so
materiality
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
unknown
speaker
it
was
on
notice
that
if
he
shipped
these
pennsylvania
titles
across
the
state
line
he
was
subject
to
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hart.
mr.
nightingale.
unknown
speaker
who
made
that...
how
were
these
virginia
certificates
falsely
made?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
same
rationale
would
apply
to
the
color
of
the
car
on
the
title?
unknown
speaker
would
the
name
of
the
seller--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
read
the
same
sort
of
materiality
requirement
into
the
terms
forged,
altered,
or
counterfeited?
unknown
speaker
mr.
nightingale...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
nightingale,
do
we
normally
look
at
the
terms
used
in
the
statute
in
light
of
their
common
law
meaning?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you,
before
you
get
to
the
limitations,
do
you
concede
that
at
common
law
the
terms
falsely
made
would
not
include
the
virginia
title?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
to
the
question
is
that
these
virginia
titles
would
not
have
been
falsely
made
at
common
law?
unknown
speaker
and
presumably
the
government
could
have
charged
mr.
moskal
with
transporting
altered
certificates,
the
pennsylvania
certificates?
unknown
speaker
are
there
other
statutes,
such
as
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
some
of
these
others
that
might
be
available?
unknown
speaker
mr.
nightingale,
don't
you
think
it's
at
least
a
reasonable
meaning
of
falsely
made,
when
i
say
a
document
is
falsely
made,
that
i
would...
assuming
it
means
something
beyond
the
common
law
meaning,
don't
you
think
i
would
think
that
the
person
who
made
it
must
know
that
it's
false,
as
opposed
to
just
having
been
given
incorrect
information
and
then
he
writes
it
out,
and
you
say
it
is
falsely
made
because
he
has
written
down
false
information
that
somebody
else
has
given
him?
that's
a
very--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
it
at
least
reasonable
to
give
it
the
other
meaning?
and
if
it's
reasonable,
why
doesn't
the
rule
of
lenity
suggest
that
that
is
the
meaning
we
ought
to
give
it?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
that,
in
the
context
in
which
this
statute
operates.
you
mean--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
could
have
said
that
about
the
common
law,
too.
the
very
first
statute
wouldn't
make...
i
don't
know
why
there
is
anything
special
about
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
the
committee
report
had
said
"and
we
expect
these
terms
to
be
given
their
normal
common
law
meaning."
would
you
still
be
making
the
same
argument?
same
context.
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
would...
you
say
you
would
still
be
making
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
when
was
this
passed?
unknown
speaker
has
the
department
made
any
effort
to
clarify
it
in
congress?
unknown
speaker
you
want
us
to
clarify
it.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view
were
these
certificates
forged?
unknown
speaker
but
we're
talking
about
questions
of
law
here,
and
so--
unknown
speaker
--so,
in
your
view
this
was
both
forged
and
falsely
made?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
where
a
document
is
falsely
made
but
not
forged?
because
if
you
can't,
then
your
argument
that
we
have
to
give
independent
meaning
to
the
two
terms,
it
seems
to
me,
fails.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
run
that
analysis
there,
i
think
your
answer
to
whether...
whether
this
document
was
forged
would
probably
come
out
the
other
way.
but
i
had
a
similar
question
to
justice
kennedy's.
can
you
tell
me...
give
me
an
example
of
something
that
is
forged
but
not
counterfeited
or
counterfeited
but
not
forged?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
isn't
that
whole
thing
just,
you
know,
just
a
vera
test?
you
know,
lawyers
use
the
same
words
to
mean
the
same
things
often,
and
you
admit
that
two
of
those
words
mean
exactly
the
same
thing.
falsely
made,
forged,
altered,
or
counterfeited.
altered
perhaps
is
something
different,
although
it's
a
sub...
a
subcategory
in
common
law,
a
type
of
forgery,
a
type
of
counterfeiting.
you
could
either
falsely
make
or
alter.
but
once
you
say
that
counterfeit
and
forge
mean
one
and
the
same
thing
i
think
your
argument
that
we
have
to
depart
from
the
common
law
meaning,
because
otherwise
falsely
made
would
also
mean
the
same
thing,
doesn't
have
much
force.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we'd
give
the
fuzziness
to
the
defendant.
that...
that's
what
the
rule
of
lenity
means.
unknown
speaker
did
this...
assuming
that
the
statute
before
1984
had
meant
something
else,
that
is
assuming
that
falsely
made
meant
what
your
opponent
says,
or
meant
what
the
common
law
says,
this
incident
in
the
1984
legislation,
or
rather
the
legislative
history
of
legislation
that
preceded
the
1984
legislation
but
didn't
get
passed,
has
the
effect
of
altering
the
meaning
that
the
statute
originally
had?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
position
of
the
1984
congress
which
did
not
enact
this
statute
is
totally
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1937
you
told
us...
'37?
unknown
speaker
'39.
of
what
possible
relevance
could
be
the
1984's
congress'
misunderstanding
of
the
law,
or
correct
understanding,
whichever
one
it
was?
of
what
possible
relevance
is
it,
unless
it
is
amending
the
law?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
this
is
an
interpretation
of
a
statute
by
congress,
this
snippet
of
legislative
history
in
'83
pertaining
to
an
'84
statute?
unknown
speaker
suppose...
suppose
you
have
an
automobile
title
that
is
counterfeited
only
with
the...
the
odometer,
that
that
is
the
only
thing
altered.
unknown
speaker
it
is
issued
correctly
by
the
state,
and
somebody
alters
the
odometer
reading,
or
the
color
of
the
car.
is
that
a
valid
automobile
title?
unknown
speaker
because
the
color
of
the
car
has
been
altered?
unknown
speaker
would
you
acknowledge
that
as
a
highly
debatable
proposition
at
least?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know,
but
if
it
is
you
could
fully
explain
the
language
congress
enacted
in
the
1984
statute
as
covering
a
situation
where
you
have
a
title
in
which
something
quite
irrelevant
has
been...
irrelevant
to
the
title
at
least,
has
been
altered.
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
said
in
many
states.
unknown
speaker
but
in
order
for
you
to
run
the
argument
you
are
with
respect
to
the
1984
statute,
you
would
have
to
be
able
to
say
in
all
states,
and
therefore
the
1984
statute
can
have
no
meaning
unless
it
refers
to
what
you
claim
it
refers
to.
unknown
speaker
no,
your
argument
is
that
this
'84
statute
is
utterly
meaningless.
and
what
i
am
suggesting
is
even
if
there
are
only
a
few
states
where
the
title
would
be
valid
even
though
there
has
been
an
alterization...
alteration,
the
statute
would
not
be
utterly
meaningless.
it
doesn't
go
to
weight.
it
goes
to
whether
your
argument
is
valid
or
not.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nightingale,
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
you
said
your
third
point
was
going
to
be
that
no
canon
of
construction
interferes
with
your
position.
would
you
want
to
discuss
the
rule
of
lenity
at
all?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
virginia
issuer
knew
that
this
odometer
reading
was
false.
that
would
be...
this
document
then
would
be
within
the
common
law
definition,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
issuer,
the
virginia
issuer
knew
that
there
was
a
false...
false
information
in
that
document
that
he
was
issuing.
wouldn't
that
document
then
satisfy
the
common
law
meaning
of
falsely
made?
unknown
speaker
could
he
falsely
make
it?
unknown
speaker
but
assume
it
was
a
forgery
and
was
falsely
made
because
the
fellow
knew
it.
will
the
person
who
sent
in
the
false
information,
who
sent
in
the
false
titles,
if
he
could
be
prosecuted
it
would
only
be
because
the
virginia
fellow
knew
it.
so
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes
whether
the
virginia
fellow
knew
it
or
not
as
far
as
his
liability
under
the
statute's
concerned.
unknown
speaker
and
this
defendant
was
responsible
for
the
false
information.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nightingale,
in
determining
whether
the
rule
of
lenity
should
be
applied,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
is
fair
to
take
this
particular
defendant
as
the
sole
example.
suppose
somebody
who
intends
to
get
his
car
painted,
but
it
isn't
painted
yet,
and
he
tells
the
person
when
he
is
making
over
the
title
put
down
red.
it
isn't
red
yet;
it
is
actually
green.
and
then
he
transports
it
in...
in
interstate
commerce.
he
would
be
in
violation
of
this
law,
although,
you
know,
if
i
were
he
reading
the
law
i
certainly
wouldn't
think
that
it
would
cover
anything
like
that.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
nightingale.
mr.
hart,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that
last
point.
why
wouldn't
it
affect
2314
if
it
affected
chop
shops
and
all
that
that
put
together
different
pieces--
unknown
speaker
--it
just
doesn't
affect
odometer
roll
backs.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
just
another
species
of
phony
documents
for
getting
to
the
same
purpose,
though,
really.
unknown
speaker
well,
fraud
and
selling
automobiles
that
are
represented
as
having
a
certain
history
when
they
have
quite
a
different
history.
unknown
speaker
the
latter
one
might
be
a
better
car.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
a
different
history
here.
most
of
the
lower
courts
have
agreed
with
the
government,
haven't
they?
