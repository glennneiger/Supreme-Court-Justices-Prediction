mr.
dennis
m.
hart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
the
lofty
world
of
holding
companies
to
the
more
mundane
world
of
a
1984
ford,
i'd
like
this
court
to
revisit
section
2314
of
title
18
and
decide
what
congress
meant
when
it
inserted
two
words
into
that
statute
50
years
ago.
those
two
words
are
"falsely
made".
as
petitioner
sees
it,
the
question,
really
the
bottom
line
question
is
whether
the
term
falsely
made
means
false
in
execution
versus
false
in
content.
the
government
has
asserted,
and
so
far
they
have
won
that
assertion,
that
the
term
should
mean
false
in
content.
they
call
this
the
broader
definition
of
the
two
words.
the
petitioner
submits
that
this
court
should
reject
that
position,
because
in
the
final
analysis
the
only
good
reason
the
government
can
give
for
defining
falsely
made
as
false
in
content
is
that
it
catches
more
people,
and
we
don't
think
that
should
be
good
enough
for
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
sir,
that
is
their
first
argument,
and
if
the
tape
could
reflect
that
i
am
scratching
my
head,
because
i
don't
know
why
it
must
have
an
independent
meaning.
certainly
courts,
the
lower
circuit
courts
who
have
considered
the
question
have
often
used
the
words
forgery
and
falsely
made
interchangeably,
and--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--yes,
and
that
is
the
general
rule.
i
do
agree
with
that.
but
that
is
not
a
rule
that
covers
everything,
because,
as
i
think
anyone
who
reads
these
statutes
can
find
that
the
words
falsely
made,
forged,
altered,
or
counterfeited
are
sort
of
a
term
of
art,
that
are
contained
in
dozens
of
federal
statutes.
and
falsely
made
is
never
defined.
and
that
is
why
lower
courts
over
many
years
have
always
concluded
that
falsely
made
equals
forged,
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
cases
which
the
government
points
out.
yet
the
government
also
agrees--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--yes,
your
honor,
like
this
case.
the
government
also
agrees
that
that
is
not,
number
one,
the
common
law
definition
of
falsely
made,
and
number
two,
they
also
agree
that
if
you
are
to
give
this
the
independent
meaning
which
they
advocate,
it
is
a
much
broader
definition
than
what
courts
have
normally
accepted.
but
even
if
we
accept
the
united
states'
position
that
this
must
have
an
independent
meaning,
the
term
falsely
made,
we
believe
this
court
can
supply
that
meaning,
that
is,
give
an
independent
meaning
to
the
word
falsely
made,
yet
still
not
necessarily
include
the
conduct
for
which
petitioner
is
charged
with,
that
is
the
inclusion
of
false
information
in
an
otherwise
valid
document.
now,
the
second
position
the
government
advocates
is
that...
if
i
can
phrase
this
correctly...
is
that
they
agree
that
the
common
law
definition
of
falsely
made
would
not
include
what
mr.
moskal
did.
they
also
say
that
congress
is
usually
presumed
to
know
what
the
common
law
meaning
was,
and
that
it
is
the
usual
presumption
that
congress
used
the
common
law
definition
when
they
wrote
the
words.
yet
they
then
argue
that
congress
cannot
be
presumed
to
use
the
arcane,
or
what
they
call
the
antiquated
definition
of
the
word.
and
then
they
argue
that
what
we
posit
as
falsely
made
is
arcane
and
antiquated.
and
we
submit
they
have
never
shown
that.
we
submit
that
the
only
reason
they
can
suggest
the
broader
definition
is
more
modern
is
that
it
encompasses
more
conduct.
yet
the
united
states
and
petitioner
both
agree,
number
one,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
indicate
that
congress
wanted
to
expand
the
common
law
definition
of
falsely
made.
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
indicates
congress
wanted
to
expand
the
common
law
definition
of
falsely
made.
and
there
is
no
subsequent
conduct
by
the
congress
which
reflects
on
that.
now--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
he
was
also
charged
with
section
513
violation,
which
is
the
possession
of
forged
state
securities.
there
were
two
counts
in
the
indictment
for
that.
but
even
if
that...
that
were
not
permitted
he
could
be
charged
under
the
mail
fraud
statute.
i
think
this
court
last
term
decided
a
case,
i
am
going
to
call
it
schmuck,
i
can't
remember
exactly
how
it
is
spelled,
where
the
operation
was
nearly
identical
to
what
mr.
moskal
did.
this
court
affirmed
that
conviction.
but
if
this
court
will
remember,
that
man
was
not
charged
with
section
2314
at
all.
he
was
charged
with
mail
fraud,
criminal
mail
fraud.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
certainly,
and
let
me--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--no,
your
honor.
and
that...
that
really...
the
crux
of
our
argument,
is
that
the
government
argues
that
mr.
moskal
has
found
a
loophole
in
this
law
and
he
is
trying
to
squeeze
through
it.
and
they
say
this
with
such
force
that
it
makes
me
even
feel
guilty
when
i
read
that.
but
that
is
really
rhetoric,
because
mr.
moskal
didn't
determine
the
charges
that
were
placed
against
him.
the
u.s.
attorney
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
decided
to
charge
him
only
with
the
virginia
titles.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
well,
to
mr.
moskal
it's
not
a
tempest
in
a
teapot.
we
submit
that--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--certainly,
your
honor,
but
not
the
type
of
prosecution
that
mr.
moskal
was.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
exactly,
your
honor.
well,
let
me
take
that
back.
i
should
add,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
it
also
is
a
violation
of
state
law.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
i
am
not
certain
i
understand
the
court's
question.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
that's
a...
that's
an
important
question,
i
think.
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
it
in
detail.
the
pennsylvania
titles
were
physically
altered.
they
were
changed.
they
were
changed
in
a
number
of
ways.
they
were
changed
in
pennsylvania
by
what
in
the
title-washing
business
is
called
an
artist.
the
artist
takes
the
titles,
changes
them,
gives
them
to
an
office
manager,
who
is
mr.
moskal.
mr.
moskal
sends
them
to
another
state,
and
in
this
case
it
was
virginia.
the
titles
come
back
clean.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
our
belief
is
we
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
2314
for
those
virginia
titles.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
the
pennsylvania
titles
were
altered.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
most
certainly.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
most
certainly,
your
honor,
most
certainly.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
i
would
be
happy
to
call
it
that.
but
the
point
is
that
we
argued
that
both
in
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
court
and
they
disagreed
with
us.
they
said
it
was
perfectly
all
right
to
charge
mr.
moskal
for
those
virginia
titles
under
2314.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
well,
we
have
two
positions
on
that.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
they
can
have
different
meanings.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes.
a
document
that's
obtained,
for
instance,
through
bribery.
that
is
a
valid
vehicle
title
in
this
case,
we'll
take
vehicle
titles.
a
vehicle
title
is
obtained
by
someone
passing
a
$50
bill
to
the
title
clerk
to
generate
a
title.
we
recently
tried
a
case
down
the
street
where
someone
stole
a
drivers
license
making
machine,
and
just
spewed
out
drivers
licenses
that
were
valid
in
every
aspect.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
well,
that
wasn't
the
question,
but
they...
they
were
valid
in
the
sense
that
they
contained
the
person's
picture,
his
correct
name,
address.
everything
was
valid,
except
it
wasn't
issued
by
the
state
where
they
stole
the
license-making
equipment.
such
a
situation
can
happen--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--well,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
forged
in
the
sense
that
anything
was
changed
on
the
title.
it
would
be
a
correct
title.
it
may
well
reflect
actual
ownership
of
the
vehicle.
everything
on
the
face
of
the
title
may
be
correct,
but
the
point
is
it
wasn't
obtained
through
the
state
secretary
of
state;
it
was
obtained
through
illegal
means,
bribery
or
theft
or
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
i
couldn't
have
said
it
better.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
i
am
not
sure
that
it
does
make
it
clear.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
well,
i...
i
do,
but
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
makes
it
clear
in
mr.
moskal's
case.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
certainly.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
yes.
but
the
question
then
would
be
is
mr.
moskal
guilty
of
the
transportation
of
those
facially
valid
titles
from
virginia
to
pennsylvania.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
no.
no,
they...
because
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
execution
of
the
document.
if
the
document
accurately
reflects
what
its
intended
purpose
is,
and
that
is
the
ownership
of
the
vehicle,
it
is
a
valid
title,
and
the
transportation
of
that
across
a
state
line
should
not
be
against
the
law.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
i
would
say
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
but
i
would
make
one
distinction,
because
the
case...
that
question
has
arisen
before.
if
the
intention
is
to
deceive
ultimate
consumers
by
the
identity
of
the
vehicle
or
the
ownership
of
the
vehicle,
then
we
believe
that
that
piece
of
paper,
even
if
facially
fine,
is
invalid
as
a
document.
but
that
was
not
the
case
here,
because
ownership
or
identity
of
each
vehicle
was
never
questioned.
it
was
only
the
odometer.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
it
makes
a...
well--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--well,
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
no,
sir,
but
i
don't
believe
it
is
any
more
important
than
say
horsepower,
or
color,
or
make.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
well,
it's
important
for
title
purposes,
that
is
you
would
want
to
know
the
chain
of
title.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
and
there
are
laws
that
make
that
an
offense
to--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--well,
yes,
in
some
respects
it
is,
but
if
i
can
pose
the
question
would
the
title
pass
if
the
odometer
was
completely
false?
and
the
answer
to
that--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--it
will
still
pass,
but
it's
subject
to
challenge.
whereas
an
odometer
reading,
it
would
not.
it
would
be
no
different
than
the
wrong
color
of
the
car.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
not
under
the
theory
that
the
title
did
not
pass.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
i
believe
that
the
state
statutes
usually
require
that.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
well,
i
imagine
that
would
vary
from
purchaser
to
purchaser.
many
purchasers--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--it
certainly
is.
it
certainly
is.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
yes.
but
we--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--no,
i
am
talking
about--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--yes,
and
our
answer
to
that
is
no.
i
am
sorry,
our
answer
to
that
is
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
i
certainly
agree
it's
important,
and
it
may
be
very
important.
but
the
question
is
is
that...
is
that
document
which
contains
the
false
odometer
reading
an
invalid
document?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
it
does
not.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
no.
we
don't
concede
that
materiality
is
the
test.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
no.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
no,
as
our
back-up
position,
if
i
may
point
that
out,
a
number
of
courts,
lower
courts
have
considered
the
question
of
materiality,
and
they
have
concluded,
quite
frankly,
that
odometers
are
a
material
part
of
the
transaction.
but
they
have
done
that
in
the
context
of
stolen
cars
and
frauds
in
which
the
identity
of
the
owner
was
concealed,
in
which
vehicle
identification
numbers
were
changed.
a
traditional
fraud
in
which
cars
are...
are
stolen,
in
which
cars
are,
the
parts
are
interchanged,
in
which
new
vehicles
are
made
and
titles
are
created
to
reflect
ownership
of
that
vehicle,
which
is
a
fraud
in
itself.
so
that
is
my
problem
with
wholeheartedly
embracing
that
position,
is
that
the
lower
courts
have
always
considered
materiality
as
an
important
part,
as
what
they
call
material,
only
in
the
context
of
stolen
cars.
and
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
united
states,
as
their
final
argument,
believes
that
broad
purpose
of
2314
as
an
antifraud
statute
could
only
be
upheld
by
a
definition
of
the
broad
meaning
of
falsely
made.
we
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
we
believe
this
court
has
considered
similar
arguments,
for
instance
when
this
court
considered
the
case
of
bootleg
records,
as
whether
they
were
counterfeit
or
whether
they
were
stolen,
under
2314
and
rejected
that.
although
this
court
many
years
ago
considered
the
prospect
of
the
inclusion
of
aircraft
as
vehicles
under
the
predecessor
of
the
motor
vehicle
theft
act,
the
statute,
the
language
of
the
statute
at
that
time
said
any
vehicle
that...
any
self-propelled
vehicle
that
wasn't
on
rails,
if
it
were
transported
would
be
a
violation
of
the
motor
vehicle
theft
act.
and
the
government's
position
was
well,
you
now
have
airplanes,
and
if
you
steal
one
of
those
it
should
be
included
in
that
because
the
meaning
was
arcane
and
antiquated.
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
we
think
similar
reason
should
apply
to
this
case.
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
ever
considered
this
type,
this
specific
type
of
fraud.
that
is...
and
i
will
admit
that
it's
a
fraud.
but
the
specific
conduct
of
sending
facially
valid
titles
from
one
state
to
another
as
within
the
gambit
of
2314.
and
this
court
has...
has
long
concluded
that
when
congress
has
the
will
it
makes
thing
clear.
when
this
court
has
to
make
decisions
for
what
congress
didn't
talk
about,
because
it's
a
criminal
statute,
the
less
broad
meaning
has
preference,
that
the
government
position
in
this
case
to
broaden
the
statute
is
given
a
very
careful
and
scrutinous
eye
by
this
court.
but
our
position
is
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
reach
that...
that
interpretation
of
what
congress
meant,
because
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
falsely
made,
even
if
this
court
must
assign
an
independent
meaning
to
those
words,
can
be
defined
as
conduct
which
does
not
cover
mr.
moskal's
conduct.
and
of
course
then
we
reach
the
problem
of...
of
notice.
because
if
the
government
has
their
way,
they
have
a
problem
with
the
notice
requirements
of
criminal
statutes,
and
exactly
what
mr.
moskal
did
was
that
effective
notice
to
all
individuals.
we
suggest
that
if
the
government
has
its
way
in
broadening
the
statute,
they
have
that
problem.
but
we
suggest
that--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--no
question
about
it.
and
i
can
tell
the
court
that
in
pennsylvania
for
years
dealers
were
given
what
amounted
to
a
ticket
for
that
activity.
in
pennsylvania
it
was
against
the
law
to
tamper
with
the
odometer
and
change
the
odometer
documents,
and
i
believe
it
was
a
$100
fine
for
each
document.
so
he
knew
that
that
was
against
the
law.
the
question
is
when
he
got
the
facially
valid
virginia
titles
back,
did
he
know
that
was
against
the
federal
law
2314?
he
did
not.
we
believe
he
was
correct
in
that.
thank
you.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
make
four
observations.
the
first
is
the
government
places
great
reliance
on
congressional
action
and
section
2311,
the
amendment
that
they
spoke
about,
about
the
valid
or
blank
titles.
i
had
to
wade
through
all
that
congressional
testimony,
and
i
didn't
see
one
mention
of
odometer
fraud,
of
title
washing
for
roll-backed
odometers.
what
congress
was
concerned
with
in
1984
was
interstate
car
thefts
and
what
they
called
chop
shops,
the
assembly
of
vehicles
from
odd
parts.
they
were
concerned
with
vehicle
identification
numbers,
and
there
was
no
concern
at
all
for
odometer
roll
backs
of
title
washing.
the
government
is
in
error
if
it
tries
to
convince
this
court
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
1984
amendments.
it
does
not
in
any
way
affect
section
2314.
the
second
observation
i
would
like
to
make
is
the
court
asked
the
united
states--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--i
am
sorry,
the
court
is
correct.
it
does
affect
it
in
that
sense.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
no,
it's
not
for
the
same
purpose.
it
is...
if
the
general
purpose
is
defraud,
yes,
it
is
the
same
purpose.
but--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--yes,
yes.
but
we
submit
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
an
old
car
sold
as
a
new
car,
and
a
car
sold
that
was
assembled
from
23
other
different
cars
or
was
stolen
across
state
lines--
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
--the...
secondarily
we
would
like
to
make
the
observation
that
in
1979
a
district
court
in
iowa
decided
the
rudge
case,
which
decided
that
what
mr.
moskal
did
in
this
case
wasn't
a
violation
of
2314.
in
1980
i
believe
it
was
the
tenth
circuit
in
sparrow
made
basically
the
same
decision,
that
if
it
was
a
valid
automobile
title
that
passed
title,
even
though
it
had
alterations,
it
was
not
subject
to
2314
prosecution.
now
subsequent
to
that
other
courts
have
disagreed.
but
since
1980
congress
has
had
the
opportunity
to
clear
that
up,
and
has
not.
and
the
reason
i
mention
that
is
because
in
examining
the
history
of
2314
circuit
courts
have
concluded
that
2314
did
not
cover
certain
things.
and
what
comes
to
mind
specifically
is
travelers'
checks.
there
was
a
circuit
court
decision
in
the
1960's,
i
believe,
that
said
this
statute
doesn't
cover
interstate
transportation
of
travelers'
checks.
when
that
opinion
was
issued
congress
came
back
and
changed
the
law
and
said
put
travelers'
checks
into
the
section.
they
realized
they
could
change
it,
they
realized
it
wasn't
there,
and
they
made
the
effort
to
change
it.
and
they
have
never
done
anything
since
sparrow
and
rudge
in
1980.
mr.
dennis
m.
hart
i
disagree
with
that
entirely,
your
honor.
i
believe
two
of
the
circuit
courts
have
agreed
with
the
government,
the
tenth
circuit
has
agreed
with
the
petitioner,
and
what
we
consider
a
similar
case,
the
district
court
in
rudge
have
agreed
with
the
petitioner.
and
so
i
would
call
it
at
best
an
even
split,
and
at
worst,
for
the
government,
it's
consideration
of
different
factors,
because
no
one
has
ever
considered
exactly
what
the
petitioner
did
in
this
case.
and
finally
we'd
observe
that
the
government
is
going
to
get
into
problems
if
it
talks
about
materiality,
because
what
the
government
didn't
mention
is
that
one
of
the
titles
in
this
case
was
altered
by
a
pencil
mark,
just
a
small
pencil
mark
in
the
number.
and
that's
all
that
was
done
in
pennsylvania.
now,
if
the
government
is
going
to
draw
a
bright
line
between
vehicle
model
and
vehicle
make,
and
odometer,
and
put
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
a
pencil
mark,
they
are
going
to
run
into
problems
with
this
case.
we
suggest
no
such
bright
line
can
exist.
thank
you.
