we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-5916,
richard
demarest
v.
james
manspeaker.
mr.
scarboro,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
mean
when
the
witness...
the
united
states
would
pay
the
fee
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what,
because,
what...
that's
because
of
this
provision
of
1825?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
when
does
it
say
the
witness
shall
be
paid
by
the
united
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
this
was,
this
was
a
federal
trial
in
the,
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--a
respondent
is
also
expected
to
raise
any
nonjurisdictional
objections
to
reaching
the
question
presented
in
the
motion...
the
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari.
chief
justice
rehnquist
cost,
mr.
scarboro,
in
the
sense
of
loss
of
income
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the,
the...
don't
witnesses
get
some
sort
of
reimbursement
for...
for
travel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
subsistence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
we
could
nonetheless
take
it
into
consideration
along
with
1821
if
we
feel
it's
relevant,
i
suppose,
in
deciding
the
question
presented.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
scarboro,
would
i
be
helping
you
out
if
i
suggested
that
1825(a)
was
directed
not
to
the
question
of
who
gets
paid,
but
to
the
question
of
who
has
to
issue
the
certificate,
which
is
a
condition
precedent
to
being
paid
and
that,
and
that
it
is
with
respect
to
certain
defense
witnesses
subpoenaed
that
there
is
a
distinction
made
about
the
issuance
of
the
certificate
as
evidence
for
the
payment
and
that
that's
the
only
thing
that
25(a)
is
directed
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
at
1:00.
we'll
resume
argument
now
in
demarest
against
manspeaker.
mr.
scarboro.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
scarboro.
mr.
lazerwitz,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--why
do
you
read
that
much
into
the
phrase
in
attendance?
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
would
surely
have
to
have
a
subpoena,
a
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
to
get...
a
subpoena
wouldn't
do
it,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazerwitz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
demarest
versus
manspeaker
in
no.
89-5916.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
an
inmate
in
a
state
prison,
who
testified
in
a
federal
criminal
trial
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum,
which
is
the
latin
meaning
for
a
writ
that
you
use
to
get
a
prisoner
to
testify.
ordinarily,
you
just
issue
a
subpoena
for
person
that
is
in
civilian
life,
so
to
speak.
but
for
a
prisoner,
you
have
to
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
that
is
directed
to
the
warden
of
the
prison.
the
petitioner
testified
and
he
requested
witness
fees
for
his
testimony
in
accordance
with
section
1821
of
the
judicial
code,
which
entitles
witnesses
in
attendance
of
a
federal
trial
to
receive
$30
a
day
for
their
services.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
10th
circuit
denied
petitioner's
request
for
a
fees
on
a
ground
that
section
1821
did
not
authorize
the
payment
of
witness
fees
to
prisoners.
the
language
of
1821,
however,
contains
no
exception
for
prisoners
who
testify
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum.
by
its
terms,
a
provision
applies
to
all
witnesses
in
attendance
except
for
detained
alien.
because
congresses
language
is
clear,
the
fact
that
administrative
agencies
have
not
paid
witness
fees
to
prisoners
in
the
past
is
not
controlling.
we
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
