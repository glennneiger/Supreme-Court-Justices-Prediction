justice
scalia
what
does...
what
does
in
attendance
mean
in,
in
that
event.
i
thought...
i
was
going
to
ask
you
what
you
thought...
i,
i
assumed
in
a
subpoena
in
attendance
might
mean
the
dates
set
forth
in
the
subpoena.
you're
in
attendance
on
those
days,
but
if
you're
coming
voluntarily
you
know,
suppose
you...
you
don't
know
how
long
the
trial
is
going
to
be.
you
come.
you
hang
around
for...
it's
only
the
days
you
appear,
or
are
those
the
only
days?
justice
scalia
so
if
you
choose
to
come
5
days
early,
so
long
as
the
trial
is
going
on
at
that
time,
you're
in
attendance.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
sure.
justice
scalia
mr.
scarboro,
how
do
you...
what
is
your
explanation
of
1825(a)?
let's
assume
that
we
agree
with
you
that
they're
entitled
to
a
fee.
1825(a)
says
what
procedures,
what
certifications
are
needed
with
respect
to
those
witnesses
entitled
to
fees
who
have
been
subpoenaed.
now
what
about
witnesses
who
haven't
been
subpoenaed?
justice
scalia
which
is
peculiar.
justice
scalia
yes,
well,
i,
i
would
say
that
is
some
indication
that
a
witness
who
is
not
subpoenaed
is
not
to
be
paid
fees
period
since
there's
no
provision
for
how
they're
to
be
paid.
if
there's
any
ambiguity
about
whether
nonsubpoenaed
witnesses
get
fees,
i'd
say
that
certainly
indicates
how
that
ambiguity
ought
to
be
resolved,
wouldn't
you
think?
justice
scalia
so
we
should
construe
1825
according
to
its
purpose,
but
not
1821?
justice
scalia
but--
justice
scalia
children
get
$30
a
day,
by
the
way?
do
children
get--
justice
scalia
--yes.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
there,
there
was
an
instance
as
i
record
where
they
received
a
witness
fee,
three
of
them
in
the,
the--
justice
scalia
--or
correctly
did
so
and
did,
and
did
not
do
so
mistakenly
in
all
the
other
instances,
as
the
case
the
may
be.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
lazerwitz,
is,
is
the
practice
consistent
as...
with
your
entire
theory?
that
is
to
say,
has
it
always
been
the
practice
uniformly
not
to
pay
witnesses
unless
they
are
subpoenaed?
justice
scalia
ah.
justice
scalia
you
like
your
witnesses
and
you
don't
like
the
defense
witness.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
you
say
he's,
he's
not
in
attendance
unless
he's
subpoenaed
except
that,
that
if
he's
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
he
doesn't
have
to
be
subpoenaed.
that's,
that's
the,
that's
the
clear
meaning
you
think
adheres
in
attendance?
justice
scalia
it
means
subpoenaed
unless
it's
a
prosecution
witness?
justice
scalia
but
you
say
that
you
don't
have
to
be
summoned
at
all
if
you're
going
to
be
a
witness
for
the
prosecution.
justice
scalia
it
just
takes
somebody
to
call
me
up
and
summon
me?
i
mean,
i
mean
could...
why
can't
the
defendant
call
up
somebody
and
say,
i
summon
you
to
appear.
the
prosecution
has
no
power
to
summon
the
person,
does
it?
justice
scalia
right.
i
mean--
--try
this
hypothetical.
they
subpoena
john
blue.
they
issue
a
subpoena
for
him
and
they
find
he's
in
jail.
and
if
he
was
not
in
jail
he
would
get
paid,
but
if
he
is
in
jail,
he's
got
a
subpoena
and
a
writ.
he
wouldn't
get
paid
under
your
theory.
justice
scalia
do
little
children
get
the
witness
fees?
justice
scalia
including
children
who
are
too
young
to
work
under
state
law
i
would
assume?
