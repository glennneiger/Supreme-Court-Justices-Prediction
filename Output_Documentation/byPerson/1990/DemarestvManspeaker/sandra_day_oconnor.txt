justice
o'connor
mr.
scarboro,
the
government
says
that
a
witness
has
to
be
subpoenaed
under
the
statute
before
he
can
be
deemed
to
be
in
attendance
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
o'connor
and
why
is
it
that
a
writ
of
habeas
ad
testificandum
isn't
a
form
of
compulsory
process?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
don't
see
why
that's
so
critical
when
you
get
back
to
figuring
out
what
in
the
world
28,
821
means
and
you
haven't
come
to
grips
i
think
with
the
provisions
in
1821
that
say
for
example
a
subsistence
allowance
shall
be
paid
to
a
witness
other
than
a
witness
who's
incarcerated
and
down
in
subsection
(e),
an
alien
who
has
been
paroled
and
so
forth
or
is
deportable
is
ineligible
to
receive
the
fees.
congress
certainly
knew
how
to
say
who
was
going
to
get
fees
and
who
wasn't.
