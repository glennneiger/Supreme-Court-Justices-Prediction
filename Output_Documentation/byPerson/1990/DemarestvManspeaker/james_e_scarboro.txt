mr.
james
e.
scarboro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
for
review
in
this
case
is
whether
a
convicted
prisoner
who
is
summoned
to
appear
as
a
witness
in
a
proceeding
in
the
court
in
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
a
witness
fee
pursuant
to
28
united
states
code,
section
1821--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--that's
correct,
your
honor...
for
the
time
that
that
person
spends
in
attendance
at
a
court
of
the
united
states.
the
petitioner
here,
richard
demarest,
was
in
1988
and
continues
to
be
a
prisoner
incarcerated
in
the
state
of
colorado,
by
the
state
of
colorado.
in
march
of
1988,
judge
jim
carrigan
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
denver
issued
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
by
which
mr.
demarest
was
transported
from
prison
in
crawley,
colorado
to
denver
county
jail
where
he
remained
for
a
little
more
than
a
month.
during
8
days
of
that
period
the
trial
in
the
underlying
criminal
case
took
place.
on
one
of
those
days
mr.
demarest
testified
as
a
witness
for
the
defense.
when
the
case
was
over
mr.
demarest
made
an
application
to
the
deputy
clerk
in
the
district
court
to
certify
his
entitlement
to
a
witness
fee
pursuant
to
28
united
states
code,
section
1825.
that
is
the
statute
that
governs
the
procedure
whereby
a
witness
applies
for
a
fee
when
the
witness
is
being
paid
by
the
united
states.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
several
related
provisions
involved.
one
is
1821,
which
provides
generally
that
witnesses
are
entitled
to
a
fee.
another
is
section
1825
which
sets
forth
the
procedure
for
receiving
payment
of
a
fee
when
the
witness
is
being
paid
by
the
united
states.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
in
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
party
and
the,
the...
in
the
case
of
a
witness
for
the
united
states
by
the
united
states;
in
the
case
of
a
defense
witness
when
the
fees
cannot
be
paid
by
the
defendant
or
the
party.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
just,
just
to--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--yes?
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
no,
in
the
ordinary
case,
your
honor,
if
a
person
is
going
to
serve
as
a
witness
in
a
case
and
the
parties
are
able
to
pay
the
fee,
you
tender
a
witness
fee
and
travel
expenses
to
the
witness
when
you
serve
the
subpoena.
that's
what
happens
in
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
in
this
case
the
state
of
colorado
or
the
united
states
government.
i
don't
know
which
paid
for
the
travel.
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct.
he
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
it
was
paid
by
the
denver
county
jail,
i
assume.
the
fact
is
not--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct.
and
he
is
not
asserting
any
right
to
expenses
in
this
case.
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
statute
in
section
1821
and
subsections
(c)
and
(d)
which
entitle
a
witness
to
reimbursement
for
expenses.
mr.
demarest
is
not
seeking
reimbursement
for
any
expenses.
what
he
is
seeking
is
a
witness...
the
payment
of
the
$30
per
day
witness
fee
pursuant
to
subsection
a(1)
of
section
1821
which
provides
for
the
payment
of
those
fees.
mr.
demarest
made
his
application
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
in
denver--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
defense
witness,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
mr.
demarest
made
his
application
to
the
clerk
and
the
clerk
referred
the
request
to
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
denied
the
request
on
the
ground
that
mr.
demarest
was
a
convicted
prisoner
and
therefore
unentitled
to
receive
a
witness
fee.
mr.
demarest,
proceeding
on
his
own
behalf,
thereafter
filed
this
lawsuit.
and
he
sued
both
the
clerk
and
the
deputy
clerk
seeking
to
compel
them
to
pay
to
certify
his
entitlement
to
a
fee,
which
then
would
be
paid
by
the
united
states
marshal.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
the
technical
argument
that
the
government
makes
with
regard
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
demarest's
position
is
very
simple
and
that
is
that
if
this
statute
means
what
it
says,
he
is
a
witness
and
he
was
in
attendance
in
at
a
court
of
the
united
states
and
served
as
a
witness.
if
the
words
in
attendance
mean
someone
who
appears
and
gives
testimony,
then
he
is
that
person.
he
also
served
as
a
witness
as
we
ordinarily
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
witness.
the
government
makes
a
technical
argument
with
regard
to
the
language
in
attendance
and
says
that
mr.
demarest
was
not
in
attendance
because
he
wasn't
personally
subpoenaed.
instead
he
appeared
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum.
that's
accurate.
he
did
appear
pursuant
to
that,
to
that
writ.
section
1821
doesn't
mention
the
word
subpoena.
never
uses
it.
section
1821
doesn't
define
the
word
in
attendance
except
to
say,
in
attendance.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
yes,
yes,
it
does.
it
does
use
the
word
subpoena,
your
honor.
that
word
is
used
in
section
1825
in
the
following
way.
section
1825
first
sets
out
how
a
witness
for
the
government,
in
a
case
where
the
government
is
a
party,
is
to
be
paid
when
the
person
is
being
paid
by
the
united
states.
then
the
statute
goes
on
to
say,
in
the
case
of
defense
witnesses
summoned
pursuant
to
a
subpoena,
the
following
procedure
shall
be
used
for
payment.
the
word
subpoena
is
not
defined
in
section
1825
but
i
submit
that
all
it
means,
that
the
common
sense
of
it
is,
that
there
be
some
kind
of
formal
process
by
which
a
court
certifies
that--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--yes,
your
honor.
certainly...
i
certainly--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--yeah,
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
we,
we
are.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
the
word
subpoena
also
appears
in
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedures
17(a).
that's
the
rule
whereby
a
court...
that
requires
a
court
to
order,
to
issue
subpoenas
for
the
attendance
of
witnesses
in
criminal
trials.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
a
volunteer
witness
ought
to
be
paid.
i
know
there
are...
yes--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--in,
in--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--in
my
view,
your
honor,
the...
in
the
first
place,
it's
not
necessary
to
answer
that
question
in
order
to
decide
this
case
we
submit,
because
mr.
demarest
did
appear
pursuant
to
a
formal
procedure.
judge
carrigan--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--issued
an
order
that
gave
him
oversight,
judicial
oversight
over
the
proceedings.
there
are
cases
in
the
lower
court
cases,
district
court
cases,
that
have
held
even...
that
even
a
witness
who
appears
voluntarily
is
entitled
to
receive
a
fee.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
better
view.
but
it's
not
necessary
to
decide
that
question--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--this
is,
this
court
has
held
that
in
attendance
in
hurtado,
the
1973
opinion
from
this
court
which
is
the
only
case
construing
section
1821
that
in
attendance
refers
to
the
time
spent
in
readiness
to
testify
while
the
trial
is
taking
place.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
as
you
know
when
you're
trying
a
case,
your
honor,
some...
you
may
subpoena--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--witnesses
for
the
opening
day
of
trial.
you
may--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--you
may
subpoena
them
for
the
opening
day
of
defense.
it's
hard
to
know
when
exactly
they'll
be,
they'll
be
required
to
attend,
but
the
time
they
spend
away
from
their
ordinary
occupations
and
in
readiness
to
testify,
as
i
understand
this
court's
opinion
in
hurtado,
they're
in
attendance.
and
incidentally
the...
the
congress
subsequently
amended
section
1821
to
incorporate
the
hurtado
ruling
and,
it
seemed
to
me,
adopted
that
view
of
the
word
in
attendance.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
they
were
not.
there,
there
were
no
opinions.
the,
there
is
nothing
about
section
1825
in
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
opinion
or
in
the
district
court
opinion.
and
as
i
understand
this
court's
ordinary
rule,
when
certiorari
is
not
granted
to
review
a
particular
question
and
the
issue
has
not
been
either
raised
or
decided
below,
the
court
will
not
ordinarily
reach
out
to
decide
it.
the
government
does
not,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
offer
any
special
reasons--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--the
respondent
can
always--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--yes,
your
honor.
the
respondent
can
always
ask.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
it
was
not
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
it
seems
only...
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
practice,
your
honor.
the
government
has
taken--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--okay,
the
government
has
taken
the
position,
at
least
with
regard
to
prisoner
witnesses,
that
there...
that
they
do
not
ever
pay
the
fees
of
prisoner
witnesses.
those
persons
are
not--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--yes,
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
if
you
mean
the
practice
as
employed
by
the
courts
under
rule
17(a),
the
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
that,
that
by
which
courts
issue
subpoenas.
the
courts
routinely
issue
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
pursuant
to
rule
17
as
well
as
subpoenas
directed
to
individuals
who
are
free
to
move
about.
as
judge
ebel
said
dissenting
below
in
this
case,
suppose
the
case
of
a
person
who
is
in
a
mental
hospital,
a
mental
institution
is
not
free
to
go.
that
person
may
not
be
personally
subpoenaed.
that
person
may
be
brought
to
court
by
virtue
of
a
process
other
than
one
entitled
a
subpoena.
is
that
person
not
entitled
to
receive
a
witness
fee?
or
suppose--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--it
might
be
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
yes.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
and
then--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--probably
not.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
i
don't
either,
your
honor.
but
i
take
it
the
government's
position
would
be
that
person
is
not
entitled
to
a
fee.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
for
example,
in
the
case
of
a
witness
who
was
detained
because
he's
unable
to
post
a
bond
for
his
own
trial
which
is
coming
up
and
is
then
subpoenaed
for
it
or
is
compelled
to
attend
as
a
witness
in
another
trial.
is
he
unentitled
to
a
fee
because
he's
not
going
to
be
personally
subpoenaed?
he's
going
to
be,
he's
going
to
be
compelled...
his
jailer
is
going
to
be
compelled--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--the
defendant--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--in
his
own
trial
is,
is,
i
would
say
he's
in
attendance.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
normal
understanding
of
the
word
witness
is
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
a
person
who
is
not
a
party
but
a
person
who
attends
a
trial
of
a
party
and
testifies.
it's
also
true
literally
that
a
person
who
is
a
party
may
testify.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct,
your
honor,
not
with
the
meaning
of
1821.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government's
position
in
this
case
rests
not
really
upon
these
linguistic
distinctions
about
the
words
in
attendance
and
witness,
but
instead
about...
on
a
perception
of
the
purpose
of
this
statute
combined
with
administrative
practice,
and
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
few
moments
dealing
with
those
two,
i
think,
more
central
points.
the
argument
is
made
by
respondents
from
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
that
its
purpose
is
to
compensate
the
average
witness
for
the
time
that
that
witness
spends
testifying
and
the
costs
that
the
witness
incurs.
from
this
the
government
leaps
to
what
i
think
is
a
remarkable
conclusion
and
that
is--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--yes.
two
kinds
of
costs,
your
honor.
one
would
be
lost
income.
the
other
would
be
out
of
pocket
expenses
some
of
which
are
reimbursed
but
as
a
practical
matter
probably
all
are
not.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
yes,
they
do,
your
honor
and
subsections
(c)
and
(d)
of
section
1821
deal
with
the
situation
in
which
you
can...
a
witness
is
entitled
to
receive
actual
reimbursement
for
certain
kinds
of
transportation
and
entitled
to
an
allowance--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--a
subsistence
allowance
depending
on
other
needs.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that...
i--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--that,
that's,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
turn
to,
justice
white,
and
the
point
is
simply
this,
that
the
government
says
it
wouldn't
serve
any
purpose
to
compensate
a
person
like
mr.
demarest.
he
incurs
no
costs.
he
is
not
losing
any
compensation.
incidentally,
that's
not
a
point
that
is
established
in
this
record.
it
is
known
from
this
record
whether,
whether
mr.
demarest
worked
in
the
prison,
if
so,
whether
he
made
wages,
and
if
he
made
wages
whether
he
lost
them
when
he
was
transported
to
denver
county
jail
to
testify.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government's
methodology
stands
the
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
construction
that
have
been
announced
by
this
court
in
case
after
case
after
case
on,
on
its
head.
and
by
that
i
mean
that
ordinarily
this
court
has
said
a
supposed
purpose
is
not
used
to
override
the
plain
meaning
of
a
statute
when
the
words
are
clear
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
ordinarily
the
meaning
that
congress
intended,
its
purpose,
is
to
be
understood
from
the
language
it
uses.
congress
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
purposes.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
legislative
commands
and
it
is
those
legislative
commands
that
are
ordinarily
the
best
evidence
about
what
congress
intended.
furthermore,
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
between
the
purpose
that
the
government
supposes
congress
had
and
paying
a
fee
to
convicted
prisoners.
and
the
reason
is
this.
congress
was
undoubtedly
aware
that
people
do
not
suffer
the
same
kinds
of
economic
losses
or
lose
the
same
amount
of
compensation
for
testifying.
congress
undoubtedly
was
aware
that
many
people
don't
lose
money
at
all,
people
who
live
on
fixed
incomes,
people
who
are...
who
survive
by
independent
means.
there
are
all
kinds
of
people
who
do
not
necessarily
suffer
any
economic
loss
by
virtue
of
testifying,
but
the
statute
simply
says
all
witnesses,
a
witness
is
entitled
to
a
fee.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
it's
not
clear
from
section
1825
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
yes,
it's
very...
section
1825
is...
has
got
a
lot
of
problems
if
you
look
at
a
variety
of
situations.
for
example,
it
might
be
that
a
witness
that
does
not
appear
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
is
required
to
be
paid
by
the
united
states
without
regard
to
these
requirements.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
possible,
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
main
point
ought
to
be
what
is
intended
by
the
use
of
the
word
subpoena
in
this
statute,
in,
in
section
1825.
the
same
word
appears
in
section
17(a),
exactly
the
same
word.
courts
routinely
issue
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
pursuant
to,
to
17(a).
there's...
no
distinction
is
made
between
personal
subpoenas
and
subpoenas
directed
at
the
custodian
of
an
individual
who's
going
to
be
produced
for
a
trial.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
this
language
if,
if...
the
idea
being
expressed
is
that
there
is
some
kind
of
formal
process,
judicial
oversight,
if
you
will,
that
enables
a
court
to
screen
the
number
of
people
who
are
called
as
witnesses
and
determine
that
they
are
material
and
necessary--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--i
don't
think
you
should
construe
1825
at
all,
your
honor.
it's
not
within
the
grant.
it
wasn't
reached
below.
it
was
an
argument
made
for
the
first
time
in
the
briefs
and
the
merits.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
all
the
government--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--certainly.
certainly.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that
is
a
possible
reading
of
section
1825,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
certainly,
it
sounds
so
to
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
i
want
to
underscore,
it...
that
this
court
in
hurtado...
the
government...
one
of
the
cases,
the
principal
case
the
government
relies
upon
for
its,
its
definition
of
the
word
in
attendance
is
hurtado
against
the
united
states.
and
in
hurtado
this
court
held
that
the
alien
witnesses
were
in
attendance.
you
will
recall
that
in
that
case,
the,
the
alien
witnesses
had
been
arrested
for
failure
to
post
a
bond
pursuant
to
formal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
46,
incarcerated
by
the
united
states
marshal
and
produced
by
the
marshal
at
the
trial.
they
were
not
personally
subpoenaed
any
more
than
mr.
demarest
was
personally
subpoenaed.
they
were
detained
witnesses.
it
just
seems
to
me
farfetched
to
think
that
congress
in
section
1821,
not
having
used
the
word
subpoena
at
all
and
using
the
word
in
attendance
we
presume
in
its
common
sense
and
ordinary
meaning,
intended
to
require
a
document
with
a
particular
label,
an
instrument
with
a
particular
label
before
a
witness
is
entitled
to
receive
a
fee.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
yes,
he
did,
your
honor,
he
thought
it
up
all
by
himself.
i
guess.
i
mean
there
are...
have
there
been
any
prior
occasions?
yes,
there
have.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
yes,
actually
prisoners
have
been
paid
witness
fees
and
there's
a
1939
comptroller
opinion
in
which
the
united
states
marshal
paid
3
prisoner
witnesses
a
fee
and
then
got
into
trouble
getting
reimbursement.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
thank
you,
chief
justice.
i
just
have
a
couple
more
points
that
i'd
like
to
make
and
then
i
will
sit
down.
i
want
to
make
a
couple
of
points
about
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
we
left
off
before
lunch
talking
to
some
extent
about
the
purpose
of
the
law.
the
language
of
section
(a)(1),
of
section
1821,
28
united
states
code,
states
as
follows:
"except
as
otherwise
provided
by
law,
a
witness
in
attendance
at
any
court
of
the
united
states.
"
and
here
i'm
skipping
a
bit,
"shall
be
paid
the
fees
and
allowances
provided
by
this
section.
"
congress
does
not
state
witnesses
who
lose
compensation
shall
be
entitled
to
a
fee.
congress
does
not
state
witnesses
who
incur
certain
kinds
of
expenses.
it
simply
says
witnesses.
mr.
demarest
may
not
be
the
average
witness.
he
may
not
have
incurred
out
of
pocket
expenses.
he
may
or
may
not
have
actually
lost
compensation,
but
that
fact
i
submit
entitles
him
no
less
to
a
fee
than
it
does
to
other
classes
of
people
who
suffer
no
loss
either
in
compensation
or
expenses
and
there
are
many
such
classes
of
people
that
immediately
come
to
mind,
including
people
living
on
retirement
incomes,
people
living
on
fixed
incomes,
many
others.
very
often
employers--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--people
who
have
no
income.
people...
very
often
employers
actually
continue
to
pay
wages
to
their
employees
even
though
those
employees
are
taking
a
day
to
serve
as
a
witness
in
a
case.
there
are
many
good
reasons
why
congress
may
have
chosen
to
legislate
in
an
overinclusive
fashion
or
in
a
generality,
such
as
the
use
of
the
word
witness,
including
administrative
convenience
and
there
may
have
been
another
reason.
members
of
congress
may
have
felt
that
witnesses
are...
should
receive
some
token
compensation
for
acting
as
a
witness
in
a
court
case.
it
might
improve--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--the
statute
has
been,
of
course,
amended
11
times
since
its
original
adoption
in
1792.
as
we
understand
it,
prisoners
could
not
even
testify.
they,
they
were
infamous
persons.
there
were
lots
of
categories
of
people
who
could
not
testify
and
convicted
prisoner
was
one
such
category.
that
disability
which
existed
at
common
law
in
various
states
and
under
federal
law
fell
away
over
the
period
from
1850
to
1920.
during
that
period
of
time,
of
course,
congress
amended
this
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
best
operating
assumption
is
that
whatever
witnesses
are
competent
to
testify
under
the
laws
evidence
to
be
witnesses
are,
are
to
be
included
in
the
term
witness.
otherwise
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
back
over
this
entire
history
and
to
go
through
categories
of
witnesses
of,
of,
for
example,
children...
people...
atheists,
there
were
all
kinds
of
categories
of
disability...
and
go
through
each
of
those
categories
one
by
one
and
decide
whether
congress
intended
to
include
or
exclude
them.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
that
provides
one
scintilla
of
evidence
that
congress
ever
intended
to
exclude
convicted
prisoners
from--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--children?
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
assume
if
they're
witnesses,
they
would.
but
i
don't
know.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
it
is--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--yes?
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct.
and
that's
what
he
sought.
he
sought
$300.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
well,
he
was
doing
as
well
as
he
could,
i
guess.
he,
he,
he
was
very
careful
to
try
to
follow
this
court's
opinion
in
hurtado.
this
court's
opinion
in
hurtado
said
that
you're
in
attendance
even
though
you're
not
testifying
when
you're
in
readiness
to
testify
and,
and
that's
the
only
claim
he
made.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
it
has
been
adjudicated,
your
honor.
there--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--not
adjudicated
in
his
favor,
your
honor,
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
no,
it
has
not
ever
been
adjudicated
in
his
favor.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
five
times.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
most,
the
most
recent...
the
oldest
opinion
is
1970.
all
of
the
opinions
take
place
between
1970
and
1986,
i
believe.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
there
is
not
one
bit
of
evidence
that
congress
knew
anything
about
it.
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
the,
the
government
does
make
the
point
here
that
there
have
been
200
years
of
unbroken,
consistent
administrative
practice.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
quite
an
exaggeration.
the
idea--
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
--well,
no--
[laughter]
mr.
james
e.
scarboro
there
may
have
been
an
incident
occurring
every
other
decade,
your
honor,
that
could
have
come
to
the
attention
of
congress.
there's
a
handful
of
judicial
opinions
and
a
handful
of
administrative
opinions.
this
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
made
the
front
headlines
of
the
newspaper,
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
apt
to
have
come
to
the
attention
of
congress.
and
indeed
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
this
ever
came
to
the
attention
of
congress.
as
i
understand
this
court...
as
i
understand
the
government's
position...
i'm
not
sure
i
do,
but
i,
but
i
think
i
do...
in
1978
when
congress
last
amended
the
statute,
there
existed
such
an
unbroken
line
of
administrative
determinations
that
congress'
failure
to
explicitly
provide
that
convicted
prisoners
may
receive
a
fee
was
in
effect
an
amendment
of
the
statute
to
adopt
an
administrative
interpretation
that
convicted
prisoners
may
not
receive
a
fee.
as
i
read
this
court's
cases
and
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
support
of
this,
this
idea
of
congressional
acquiescence,
some
link
is
required
between
the
practice
and
congress'
knowledge.
indeed,
this
court's
cases
i
think
are,
are,
are...
require
much
more
than
knowledge.
they
require
some
kind
of
substantial
evidence
of
oversight,
of
adoption,
of,
of
approval
of
the
administrative
practice.
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
this
case.
this
is
a
statute
addressed
to
the
courts.
it's
not
a
statute
that
is
addressed
peculiarly
to
an
administrative
agency.
it's,
it's
the
business
of
the
courts
to
interpret
it.
