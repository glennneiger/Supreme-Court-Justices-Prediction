mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
witnesses
in
federal,
and
state
court
proceedings
for
that
matter,
have
received
a
modest
fee
for
their
service
since
at
least
the
days
of
the
first
congress.
but
despite
such
a
200-year
record,
no
one
has
been
able
to
find
a
single
instance
in
either
federal
or
state
practice
where
a
convicted
prisoner
lawfully
and
properly
received
a
witness
fee.
petitioner
would
write
off
this
record
as--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
in
1939
the
marshal's
service
mistakenly
provided
witness
fees
to
convicted
prisoners.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
we
think
that,
we
think
that
you
should
not
write
off
this
practice
as
nothing
more
than
one
of
the
longest
running
violations
of
a
statute's
plain
meaning
in
our
legal
history.
instead,
we
submit
that
a
closer
look
at
the
statute
and
the
historical
record
shows
the
opposite
is
the
case.
as
currently
enacted,
the
federal
witness
fee
statute
provides
that
fees
and
allowances...
excuse
me,
allowances
shall
be
paid
to
witnesses
in
attendance
at
federal
court
proceedings.
and
the
particular
question
here
is
whether
petitioner,
a
convicted
state
prisoner,
is
entitled
to
receive
the
fees
under
the
statute
where
he
testified
in
a
federal
criminal
case.
in
our
view,
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
receive
the
fees
under
the
statute
because
he
was
not
in
attendance
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
as
the
statute's
structure
and
history
suggests,
in
attendance
means
more
than
just
being
there.
it
also
includes
the
process
under
which
the
witness
appears
in
court.
a
prisoner
such
as
petitioner
appears
in
court
under
a
particular
process
directed
to
his
custodian
and
that
process
is
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum.
in
other
words,
in
attendance
in
this
statute
means
a
witness
who
has
been
summoned
to
appear,
summoned
himself,
and
who
then
makes
himself
available
and
complies
with
that
process.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
mr.
chief
justice,
we
read
the
statute
in
that
way
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one,
it
is...
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute
and
second,
the
structure
of
the
statute,
the
structure
of
section
1821
and
1825
which
does
not
drop
out
of
this
case,
not
withstanding
our
failure
to
raise
the
point
in
our
brief
and
opposition
that
petitioner
doesn't
qualify
to
receive
the
certificate
because
of
his
default.
1825
speaks
in
terms
of
subpoenas
and
a
subpoena
is
the
ordinary
process
for
summoning
witnesses
to
court.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it's
a
sound,
but
one
that
we
don't
agree
with
for
these
reasons.
1825
speaks
in
terms
of...
it's
the
procedure
for
paying
the
witness.
how
does
a
witness
get
paid?
you
can't
be
so...
1825
relates
to
1821.
if
you're
a
witness...
the
only
parties
that
1825
speaks
about...
it's
not
parties
but
persens...
are
those
who
would
otherwise
qualify
under
1821.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
provide
for
payment
of
fees
under
1821
that
do
not
establish
a
procedure.
the
statutes
should
be
read
together
which
makes,
makes
sense
to
us.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
that's
true
because
in
1825(a)
you'll
notice
that
there's
no
provision
for
paying...
when
the
government
subpoenas
a
witness
the
same
requirements
don't
obtain.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
and
let
me
explain
why.
first
of
all,
1825...
there
are
two
separate
questions
and
one
is...
the
first
question,
the
first
point
that
we
raise
in
our
brief,
admittedly
belatedly,
which
is
whether
this
particular
witness...
we
do
concede
that
mr.
demarest
was
a
witness...
presented
the
right
pieces
of
paper
to
be
paid.
the
second
question,
and
the
broader
question
that's
before
this
court,
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
1821,
and
we
submit
that
it
makes
sense
to
look
at
section
1825,
the
procedures,
in
order
to
understand
what
congress
was
dealing
with
in
section
1821.
and
the
use
of
the
word
subpoena
and
again
this...
there
are
no
smoking
guns
in
this
case
for
our
position.
we
are
trying
to
piece
together
what's
out
there
and
understand
the
statute.
and
the
fact
that
there's
been
this
200-year
practice,
starting
with
the
first
witness
fee
statute,
suggests
to
us
that
you
can't
write
this
case
off
out
of
plain
meaning.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
our
textual
basis
is
in
1821,
which
is
in
attendance.
and
we
can--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--that's,
that's
part
of
it,
justice
souter.
but
our
position
is
somewhat...
is
broader
and
that
is,
it's
not...
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court,
but
our
position
is
if
you
have
a
subpoena,
you
get
paid.
if
you
don't,
you
don't
get
paid.
it's
a
little
bit
more
subtle
than
that.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
because
we
think
1825
supports
our
position
and
helps
understand
what
in
attendance
means
in
1821.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
if
all
we
were
relying
on
were
section
1825,
then
your
point
would
be
well
taken.
but
that's
not
all
that
we're
relying
on.
a
part
from
1825's
reference
to
subpoenas,
and
i
refer
you
also
to
1825(c)
which
speaks
more
generally
in
terms
of
subpoenas,
we
have
first
of
all
the,
the
older
statutes.
if
yo
look
at
where
this
statute
came
from,
the
earliest
witness
fee
statutes
in
1792
and
1799
spoke
in
terms
of
summoning
witnesses.
summoning
is
the
ordinary...
summoning
means
subpoenaing
a
witness.
and
we
know
that
from
blackstone.
we
know
that
from
contemporary
practice
that
we
cited
in
our
brief.
congress
then
changed
to
the
word
attend,
and
it
did
so
in
1796,
but
then
returned
to
the
word
summoned
in
1799.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
justice
marshall,
no.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it
would
make
it
easier,
but
we
don't
think
we
need
it.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it
would
help.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
statute
says
witness
in
attendance.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
one
of
the
reason's
why
we
think
it's
not
that--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
that's
true,
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
and
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
receive
the
fees
under
our
position.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
because
he
again--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--and
going
back
to
the
hypothetical
that
was
raised
this
morning
before
lunch.
take
the
example
of
a
party.
the
party
testifies
in
his
own
behalf.
it's
been
settled
and
no
one
disputes,
including
petitioner,
that
a
party
witness
is
not
entitled
to
the
fees.
petitioner
would
defend
that
result
by
saying
that
a
party
is
not
a
witness.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
justice
marshall.
i'm
trying
to
show
that
the
statute's
plain
terms
are
in...
are
more
ambiguous
than
at
first
glance.
now
we
submit
that
a
party
witness
isn't
entitled
to
the
fee
not
because
he
isn't
a
witness,
because
of
course
he's
a
witness.
he
testifies
in
court.
that's
what
a
witness
does.
but
because
he
is
not
summoned
to
court--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--it
says
witness
in
attendance.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
i
do.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
i
don't
know
either,
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
fact
that
there's
been
this
consistent
practice
requires
us...
consistent
practice,
not
just
administratively
but
from
the
courts
and
through
history,
suggests
that
there's
something
more
going
on
here.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
and
let
me--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--let
me
clarify
this,
the
apparent
preoccupation
with
subpoena.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
it's
not.
our
preoccupation
is
with
process.
and
it's
the
particular
process.
the
ordinary
process
for
getting
a
witness
to
appear
in
court
happens
to
be
a
subpoena.
but
for
example,
let's
say
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
needs
a
witness
to
come
down
to
court
tomorrow.
he
doesn't
have
the
opportunity
to
subpoena
him.
he
calls
him
up
and
says,
i
want
you
here
in
court
tomorrow
and
the
witness,
the
man
appears
in
court
tomorrow.
he
is
entitled
to
a
witness
fee,
because
the
process,
although
he
doesn't
have
the
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand,
he
is
summoned
by
the
equivalent,
so
to
speak,
of
a
subpoena
to
appear
in
court
and
he
complies
with
that
subpoena.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
he
would
be
a
witness.
the
problem
he
would
face
would
be
1825,
the
procedure
for--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--if
that
case
occurred,
i
would
imagine
that
the
witness
would
be
able
to
be
paid,
but
there
would
be...
he
would
have
to
have--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
he
wouldn't
be
paid
unless
he
received
the
subpoena.
the
difference
between
treating
those
two
situations
differently
is
that--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
justice
scalia,
it's
not
that
at
all.
it's...
the
marshal
service
is
under
1825
pays
witness
fees
and
the
marshal
service
can
rely
on
the
united
states
attorney
that
this
witness
in
fact
was
summoned
and
he
appeared.
he
doesn't
have
that
same
relationship
with
the
defense
attorneys,
and
so
he
needs
the
piece
of
paper
saying
that
this
man
in
fact
was
called.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it
is
a
form
of
compulsory
process,
but
it's
not...
there
is
a
difference
between
a
writ
and
a
subpoena
and
what
was
said
this
morning
was
somewhat
misleading.
although
we
acknowledge
that
courts
under
rule
17
use
the
terms
writ
and
subpoena
loosely
and
interchangeably
for
that
matter,
the
authority
to
issue
a
writ
is
not
rule
17,
it's
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
28
u.s.c.
2241
and
that's
what...
some
of
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
i
believe
the
third
circuit
case,
united
states
v.
story,
makes
that
point.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
and
we
think
that
the
way
to
read
the
statute
and
the
way,
the
way
we
read
the
statute
is
to
look
at
(a)(1)
and
(d)(1)
differently.
in
(a)(1)
the
limiting
factor
is
attendance.
in
(d)(1),
the
limiting
factor
is
incarcerated.
for
example,
if...
the
two
subsections
are
perfectly
consistent,
because
if
(d)(1)
didn't
accept
incarcerated
witnesses,
a
prisoner
witness
would
be
entitled
to
claim
the
subsistence
allowance.
but
that
doesn't
mean
he's
back
in
(a)(1),
because
our
submission
is
he
was
not
in
attendance.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
the
meaning
of
in
attendance
refers
to
the
process
by
which
they're
summoned
and
that
you
make
yourself
available
by
complying.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
you
are
summoned,
justice
scalia.
you
may
not
be
summoned
by
the
formal
piece
of
paper
in
those
few
instances
where
that's
not
practicable.
but
you're
still
summoned.
you've
summoned
yourself.
a
prisoner
witness
is
in
a
much
different
situation.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
it's...
if
you
don't
have
the
subpoena,
you
can--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
justice
marshall,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
we
think
it
makes
good
sense
because
that's
what
congress
has
enacted
and
that's
the
way
it's
been
since
1792.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
again--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--a
witness
who
was
incarcerated...
if--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yeah,
we--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--that's
one
way
of
reading
it,
justice
souter.
we
don't...
again,
this
is
not
the
most
perfectly
drafted
statute
that
i've
ever
come
across.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
there's
another,
there
are
other
witnesses,
potential
witnesses
who
need
to
be
excepted
under
(d)(1).
for
example,
a
witness
is
subpoenaed
to
appear,
an
ordinary
witness,
who
is
not
in
prison.
and
he
comes
to
court
and
he's
housed
overnight
and
for
the
week
while
the
trial
is
going
on
and
he
ends
up
in
jail
on
unrelated
charges.
he's
otherwise
in
attendance
at
that
point.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
he
is
in
attendance
in
the
sense
that
he's,
he
has
complied
with
the
process,
he
has
been
summoned,
but
he's
not
entitled
to
the
subsistence
allowance
because
he
finds
himself
in
jail.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
again,
the...
under
our
reading
of
the
statute,
in
attendance
is
critical
and
does
make
sense
of
the
rest
of
the
subsections.
it
takes
care
of
the
exclusion
for
the
aliens,
because
otherwise
aliens
would,
the
few
aliens--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
that's,
that's
true,
justice
stevens,
and
again--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the
hypothetical,
the
one
i
can
think
of
that
isn't
so
farfetched
is
the
prosecutor's
in
court
trying
a
case
and
at
the
luncheon
recess
a
guy
in
the
back
of
the
room
says,
psst,
i
heard
something
or
i
know
something.
put
me
on
the
stand.
that
person
would
not
be
entitled
to
receive
the
witness
fee
because
he
hasn't
been
summoned.
he's
just
there.
but
he's
willing
to
testify...
that's
fine.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
in
terms
of
real
practice
the...
not
to
make
it
more
informal,
but
there's...
the
distinction
is
pretty
much,
on
the
street,
off
the
street.
the
government
goes
out
of
its...
will
go
out
of
its
way
to
pay
witnesses
who
make
an
effort
or
who
testify
other
than
those
who
are
excluded
from
the
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
i
think
he
would,
probably
in
the
sense
that
the
same
practice
that
the
government
follows.
after
he
testifies
the
defense
attorney
would
get
him
a
subpoena
and
then
he--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
one
example,
justice
white,
is
the
prisoners
who
aren't
convicted.
now
under
our
construction
of
the
statute
those
persons
fall
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute
and
under
the
department
of
justice
regulation
which
draws
a
distinction
between
in
custody
and
not,
that
person
would
fall
out.
but
in
1900,
the
comptroller
general
drew
a
distinction
between
convicted
and
nonconvicted
prisoners
and
said
that
if
you're
not
convicted
yet,
you're
entitled
to
the
fee.
so
it's
not
as
pristine
as
we'd
like
it
to
be.
there
are
people
that
have
received
witness
fees
that
otherwise
perhaps
might
not.
but--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--oh,
i
think
there's
quite
a
bit
in
the
legislative
history
that
helps.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
again,
in
the...
the
earliest
statutes
spoke
in
terms
of
summoning
witnesses,
which
by
definition
would
exclude--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
actually
that
points
to
what--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--in
the
sense
that
it's
process.
but
the
summons
is
directed
to
the
custodian
and
that's
one
of
the
distinguishing
features
here.
the
prisoner
has
no
choice.
he
is
going
to
be
in
court
or
at
the
jail
outside
the
court
whether
he
wants
to
or
not.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
it's
different.
you
at
least
have--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
you
will,
but
the
prisoner
doesn't
even
have
that
option
unless
he
goes
and...
i--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--he's...
again,
we
are
speaking...
we
are
using
words
that
on
the
one
hand
could
be
termed
colloquial.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
in
1900,
he
drew
that
distinction.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
a
subpoena
would
not
and
again
that's...
in
terms
of
where
the
custodial
status
of
a
witness
moves
away
from
the
convicted
prisoner,
we
do
get
into
a
gray
area
of
whether
they're
entitled
to
fees
under
the
statute.
under
our
construction
of
the
statute
and
under
the
doj
regulation,
if
you're
in
custody
that's
the
distinguishing
feature.
custody
in
the
sense
of
the
state's
custody,
loss
of
liberty.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
they
do,
but
not
in
the
sense
that
the...
they're
not...
we
don't
rely
on
them
as
a
law
or
for
chevron
purposes.
because
the
department,
the
attorney
general
promulgated
those
regulations
as
a
matter
of,
so
to
speak,
housekeeping.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
he
would
not
be
because
the
only
persons
in
custody
who
are
entitled
to
receive
witness
fees
are
the
ones
set
out
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it's
only
been...
it's
only
been
promulgated
since
'86,
but
that
has
been
the
department's
practice
since,
since
we
can
document
the
practice
from...
this
has
been
the
practice
from
the
18th
century
and
the
practice...
if
you...
the
reason
why
the
history
is
important
is
the
idea
of
a
witness
isn't
simply
the
testimony
in
court.
we
think
the
process
is
part
and
parcel
of
being
a
witness
and
we
know
that
because
of
the
idea
of
attendance.
attendance
connotes
getting
there
and
it
brings
out
the
point
of
the,
of
the
volunteer
witness.
and
a
prisoner
is
in
a
much
different
position
from
everyone
else
who
can
be
a
witness,
because
he
is
going
to
be
at
the
courthouse
whether
he
wants
to
or
not,
whether
he's
going
to
testify
or
not.
and
that's
the
distinguishing
feature
that's
consistent
throughout
the
legislative
record
and,
yes,
we
don't
have
statements
in
the
legislative
history
that,
well,
of
course,
prisoners
don't
get
paid.
but
this
has
been
the
practice
and
the
practice
we
submit
stems
from
the
earlier
statute.
in
terms
of
policy,
the
policy
is
somewhat
murky
but
to
look
at
it
from
a
practical
standpoint,
today
it's
obvious
that
most
prisoners,
and
convicted
prisoners,
do
work
in
their
penitentiary.
in
the
federal
system
the
average
pay
is
30,
40
cents
an
hour
and
you
can't
work
more
than
7
hours
a
day.
congress
provided
the
witness
fee
not
only
to
compensate
for
the
burden
of
testifying
but
as
some
sort
of
an
inducement,
as
a...
it's
your
duty.
we
will
pay
you.
it
seems
somewhat
farfetched
that
congress
would
be
paying
only
$30
a
day
to
your
ordinary
witness
and
the
general
category
witnesses,
which
is
less
than
the
minimum
wage
but
then
turn
around
and
provide
that
to
convicted
prisoners,
which
would
be
a
bonanza.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
they
do.
and
the
department
will
usually
make
special
arrangements
to
pay
travel
expenses
for
the
child's
guardians
or
parents.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
including
these.
prisoners,
of
course,
are
in
a
different
position.
and
in
terms
of
if
the
court
wishes
to
look
at
the
policy
and
how
it
makes
sense,
providing
this
sort
of
bonanza
to
prisoner
witnesses
would,
could
create
disincentives.
and
the
disincentive
would
be
to
become
a
good
witness.
i
want
to
be
a
witness.
i
have
information
to
give
to
the
court
for
both
the
defense
and
the
government.
and
we...
congress...
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
wanted
to
encourage
that
when
we
have
this
unending
practice
of
drawing
the
distinction
between
convicted
prisoner
witnesses
and
all
others.
and
we
concede
that
as
you
get
away
from
these...
this...
these
two
ends
of
the
spectrum
there
are
difficulties.
but
the
one
thing
we
do
know
and
no
one
has
been
able
to
dispute
is
that
convicted
prisoners
have
fallen
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute
since
the
beginning
and
the
reason
is,
we
submit,
is
the
process.
and
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
court
with
the
impression
it's
just
a
piece
of
paper
calling
it
a
subpoena
or
a
writ,
but
the
process
of
how
the
prisoner
gets
to
court.
and
because
he
gets
to
court
differently
from
everyone
else,
and
differently
from
the
way
congress
envisioned
witness
attendance
in
1792
and
throughout
its
history,
he's
not
entitled
to
receive
that
fee
under
the
statute
as
it's
currently
written.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
