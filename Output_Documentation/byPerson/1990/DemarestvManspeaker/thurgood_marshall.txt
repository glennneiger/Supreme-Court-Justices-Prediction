mr.
scarboro?
justice
marshall
if
it's
an
ordinary
witness
does
he
pay
his
own
travel
or
does
somebody
pay
his
travel?
justice
marshall
a
fee
plus
travel.
justice
marshall
now,
in
this
case
the
government
paid
travel?
justice
marshall
well,
he
didn't
pay
it.
justice
marshall
who
paid
his
food?
justice
marshall
so
the
county
jail
fed
him.
justice
marshall
so
his
out-of-pocket
expenses
were
zero?
justice
marshall
mr.
scarboro--
justice
marshall
--if
he
is
there
for
10
days
and
doesn't
testify--
justice
marshall
--he
would
get
300
bucks.
justice
marshall
that's
good
work
if
they're
paying
him.
justice
marshall
did
it
ever
put
a
subpoenaed
witness,
quote
and
unquote?
justice
marshall
well,
don't
you
need
that
for
your
argument?
justice
marshall
don't
you
need
it?
justice
marshall
the
statute
just
says
witness.
justice
marshall
and
witness
is
witness.
with
or
with...
if
a
witness
walks
in
out
of
the
street
and
says
i'd
like
to
talk.
if
the
judge
let's
him
talk,
that's
a
witness.
justice
marshall
is
it
not?
justice
marshall
and
nobody
called
him.
he
just
volunteered.
justice
marshall
why
not,
under
your
rule?
justice
marshall
why
not?
justice
marshall
we're
not
talking
about
parties.
we're
talking
about
the
government
and
defendants.
justice
marshall
where
did
he...
where
did
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute?
the
statute
says
witness.
justice
marshall
you
know
what
a
witness
is
and
i
know
what
a
witness
is.
justice
marshall
and
everybody
in
town
knows.
and
it
applies
to
about
25
different
types,
those
who
are
subpoenaed,
those
who
volunteer,
those
who
are
a
party,
those
who
testify
under
the,
the
writ.
in
all,
they
didn't
draw
the
line.
you've
drawn
the
line,
and
when
you
talk
about
how
this
never
came
up
before,
i
don't
know
too
many
lawyers
who
will
take
a
case
that
involves
$30.
[laughter]
justice
marshall
all
right.
justice
marshall
and
that
makes
good
sense
to
who?
[laughter]
justice
marshall
i
don't
know
whether
we've
gotten
it,
but
you
admit
that
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
will
help
you?
justice
marshall
give
me
just
a
little
bit
of
it.
justice
marshall
well,
isn't...
wasn't
this
witness
summoned?
justice
marshall
you
don't
say
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
is
not
a
summons?
it's,
it's...
you
just
don't
obey
one
of
them
and
you'll
see
what
will
happens.
[laughter]
justice
marshall
you
don't
call
that
a
summons?
no,
i
mean
seriously--
justice
marshall
--isn't
that
kind
of
a
subpoena?
justice
marshall
well,
you
disobey
one
and
you'll
find
out.
justice
marshall
well,
then
he's
summoned.
justice
marshall
i'm
not.
i'm
only
using
the
word,
one
word,
witness.
i
don't
need
any
other
words.
in
the
case
of
a
prisoner,
of
a
prisoner
awaiting
trial,
who,
who
is
wanted
as
a
witness,
you
say
the
comptroller
general's
ruling
allows
him
to
be
paid?
