justice
white
well,
the
technical
arguments
made
by
the
government
weren't
made
below,
were
they?
justice
white
well,
the
respondent
can,
the
respondent
can
ask
the
court
to
decide
a
case
on
another
ground.
justice
white
if
the
record
does...
supports
it.
but
a
respondent--
justice
white
but
here
what,
which
of
the
purposes,
if
any,
of
having
a
witness
fee
was
incurred
by
this
defendant?
justice
white
he
wasn't
out-of-pocket
in
this
instance.
justice
white
mr.
scarboro,
did
mr.
demarest
think
up
this
claim
by
himself?
justice
white
and
there...
has,
has
ever...
has
a
prisoner
ever
been
paid
a
witness
fee?
justice
white
you
would
think
this
would
have
been
settled
long
ago,
mr.
scarboro,
but
this
is
one
of
the
few
people
who
had
the
nerve
to
make
this
claim
i
suppose.
[laughter]
but
has
it
ever
been
adjudicated
before?
justice
white
but
in
his
favor?
justice
white
what?
justice
white
it's
been
adjudicated
not
in
his
favor?
justice
white
many
times?
justice
white
five
times,
especially
when
congress
is
amending
the
law?
justice
white
well,
has
the,
has
the,
the
practice
was
up
til...
maybe
up
til
now
not
to
pay
these
fees.
congress
must
have
known
that
when
it
was
amending
the
law.
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
you
mean
it's
190?
[laughter]
justice
white
198,
198.
justice
white
that's
your
preoccupation.
justice
white
well,
is
it
the
same
if
the
defendant
calls
up
his
friend
and
says,
come
on
down
and
testify
for
me
and
he
shows
up?
justice
white
well,
your
answer
is
that
wouldn't
be
process
that
you're
talking
about
even
though
he
just
uses
the
phone
like
the
prosecutor
does.
justice
white
despite
1825?
justice
white
well,
do
the
doj,
doj
regulations
cover
this
case?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
does
the
regulation...
under
the
regulation
this
particular
prisoner
would
not
be
entitled?
justice
white
how
long
has
that
regulation
been
in
effect?
