justice
souter
if
we
construe--
justice
souter
--if
we
construed
subpoena
to
mean
only
subpoena
would
that...
and
imposed
in
effect
the
subpoena
requirement
as
the
government
argues,
would
that
be
consistent
in
every
respect
with
the
practice
which
is
actually
obtained?
justice
souter
i
think
you
probably
know
more
about
that
than
i
do,
so
i'm
going
to
let
you
define
that.
justice
souter
regardless
of
who
calls
them?
justice
souter
umm.
justice
souter
can
you
think
of
a
better
one
from
your
side
right
now?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
well,
mr.
lazerwitz,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions
about
that?
the
first
is
the
same
one
which
i,
i
asked
your
brother
before
lunch
and
i,
i
in
a
way
i
made
it,
i
guess
a
made
a
dangerous
move
in
doing
that
because
i
just
looked
at
the
statute
again
and
it
struck
me
that
it
might
simply
be
addressing
the
question
of
who
has
to
certify
that
the
witness
was
there
as
opposed
to
who
has
to...
as
opposed
to
identifying
the
kind
of
witness
or
the
process
by
which
it...
a
witness
may
be
identified
as
compensable.
do
you
think
that
is
a
sound
analysis
or
a
sound
suggestion?
justice
souter
well,
what
i'm,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
procedure
that
1825
addresses
may
well
be
simply
a
procedure
for
distinguishing
some
witnesses
who
cannot
be
paid
without
the
certification
of
a
public
defender
or
a
clerk
of
court
as
opposed
to
witnesses
who
may
be
paid
on
certification
of
a
united
states
marshal.
justice
souter
so,
i
guess
what
that...
well,
that
leads
to
my
second
question
and
that
is
on
your
reading,
which
if
i
understand
it
correctly
is
that
there
must
a
subpoena
before
a
defense
witness
may
be
paid,
that
would
still
allow
the
payment
of
a
defense
witness...
i'm
sorry,
that
would
still
allow
for
the
payment
of
the
witness
fee
to
a
prisoner
called
by
the
government,
wouldn't
it?
justice
souter
well,
fair
enough,
but
the
administrative
practice
issue
is
the,
is
really
a
separate
argument.
isn't
it
true
that
the
only
textual
basis
that
you
have
for
distinguishing
between
some
prisoners,
at
least,
and
nonprisoner
witnesses
is
the
language
of
1825(a).
you
have
no
other
textual
basis
for
doing
that,
do
you?
justice
souter
but
you're
then,
as
i
understand
it,
you're
defining
in
attendance
by
reference
to
the
process
by
which
the
person
comes
into
attendance
and
that's
why
you
place
the
emphasis
on
the
need
for
a
subpoena
for
a
defense
witness
as
indicated
in
1825.
justice
souter
then,
then
why
don't
you
forget
1825
completely.
justice
souter
yeah,
but
if
1825
is
supposedly
reflecting
your
theory
of
what
in
attendance
means,
you've
got
to
face
the
fact,
haven't
you,
that
1825
only
refers
to
defense
witnesses,
by
which
i
assume
they
mean
witnesses
called
by
the
defense,
which
would
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
a
prisoner
called
by
the
government
would
get
paid
and
a
prisoner
called
by
the
defense
would
not.
justice
souter
mr.
lazerwitz,
may
i
ask
you
a
specific
question
about
subsection
(d)(1)?
that
reads,
a
subsistence
allowance
shall
be
paid
to
a
witness
other
than
a
witness
who
was
incarcerated
when
an
overnight
stay
is
required
at
the
place
of
attendance
and
so
on.
as
i
understand
it
on
your
theory,
this
place
of
attendance
implies
that
the
witness
being
referred
to
is
one
who
has
been
summoned
in
the
manner
you
describe.
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
if
that
is
so,
then
why
isn't
the
exception
other
than
the
witness
who
was
incarcerated
a
redundancy?
justice
souter
because
it
would
never
apply
to
such
a
person.
justice
souter
because
we
have
a
separate
subsection
for
the
witnesses
who
are
detained,
so--
justice
souter
--so
this,
i
assume,
can
only
apply
to
a
witness
who
is
incarcerated
as
a
prisoner
or
otherwise
and
it
seems
to
me
that
on
your
reading
the
exception
is
redundant
because
such
a
witness
would
never
be
in
attendance.
justice
souter
no,
but
i,
i
guess
my
problem
is
i
don't
see
how
i
can
accept
your
theory
of
what
attendance
means
without
finding
a
redundancy
in
the
exception.
justice
souter
well,
on
your
theory
didn't
he
start
out
in
attendance
but
once
he
gets
committed
to
jail
on
the
unrelated
charges,
he
is
no
longer?
justice
souter
okay.
