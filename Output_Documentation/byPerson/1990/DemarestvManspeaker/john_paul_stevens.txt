justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
you...
was
he
a
defense
witness
or
a
prosecution
witness?
justice
stevens
he
was
a
defense
witness.
justice
stevens
but
section
1825
uses
the
term
subpoena?
justice
stevens
well,
are
you,
are
you
now
arguing
that
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
is
a
subpoena
within
the
meaning
of
this
section?
justice
stevens
so
we're
getting
a
little
bit
away
from
pure
plain
language
now.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
what
do
you
say
with
respect
to
a
volunteer
witness?
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
he
ought
to
be
but
the
statute
requires
it--
justice
stevens
--because
he's
in
attendance.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
what
other,
what
other
process
would
it
be
for
a
person?
i
don't
understand
why
a
person
in
a
mental
hospital
has
no
special
process
for--
justice
stevens
--oh,
then
they'd
be
comparable
to
this--
justice
stevens
--if
they're
in
custody.
justice
stevens
but
not
if
they're
in
a
private
mental
institution
i
don't
suppose?
justice
stevens
no.
but
you're
just
saying
if
they...
in
a
different
area
of
government
custody.
i
don't
know
why
that's
a
different
case
than
this
one.
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
well,
you
raise
an
interesting
question...
what
about
the
defendant
in
his
own
trial?
is
he
in
attendance?
and
does
he
get
a
fee?
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
he
does.
justice
stevens
but
they've
never
paid
them
fees.
justice
stevens
you
say
that
the...
when
a
defendant
is
testifying
the
defendant
is
not
a
witness
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
but
on
that
point...
i'm
just
curious...
well,
you
point
out
in
your
brief
at
page
37
that
back
in
the
earlier
days,
the
prison
inmates
forfeited
all
their
rights
and
their
time
and
services
belonged
entirely
to
the
government.
that
was
the
prevailing
view.
if
that
was
the
view
of
congress
when
this
statute
was
addressed...
drafted,
which
way
does
that
cut?
justice
stevens
mr.
lazerwitz,
let
me
just
go
back
to
justice
souter's
question.
it
seems
to
me
you
may
have
given
up
more
than
you
should.
why
does
the
witness
have
to
be
one
who's
in
attendance
for
that
to
apply?
why
couldn't
it
be
a
witness
who's
not
been
summoned?
he's
a
volunteer
witness
or
he's
the
defendant
himself.
if
the
term
witness
includes
witnesses
who
are
in
attendance
and
also
the
defendant,
the
defendant
is
not
in
attendance
within
the
meaning
of
your
statute
because
he
wasn't
compelled.
why
couldn't
it...
why
couldn't
that
refer
to
the
defendant?
justice
stevens
and
also,
why
couldn't
it
also
include
volunteer
witnesses
who
would
not
be
in
attendance
under
your...
but
you
know
you
haven't
really
answered
the
question
that
was
put
to
you
earlier.
is
a
volunteer
witness
in
attendance
or
not?
there
must
be
a
practice
that
the
government
follows.
justice
stevens
i
bet
he
normally
gets
the
fee
if
he
wants
it.
justice
stevens
i'm
more
interested
in
the
volunteer
witness
for
the
defense.
his
brother
comes
in
and
testifies.
you
don't
need
to
subpoena
your
brother.
does
he
get
paid
or
doesn't
he?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
really
under--
--the
government
will
pay
people
that
they
aren't
authorized
to
pay.
