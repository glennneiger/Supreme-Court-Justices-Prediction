chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1452,
mobil
oil
v.
united
distribution
companies,
and
no.
89-1453,
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
v.
united
distribution
companies.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
lee,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
ms.
halladay,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
the
ceiling
price,
ms.
halladay?
the,
the
price
you
just
referred
to--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--is
the
new
ceiling.
now,
as
these
gfn
procedures
have
worked
in
practice,
have
most
of
them
ended
up
with
the
pipeline
paying
the
ceiling
price
or
paying
something
less?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
pipeline
offers
to
pay
the
market
price,
that
suggests
that
the
price
it
is
paying
under
the
contract
is
lower
than
market?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
have
really
three
kinds
of
prices.
one,
the
contract
price
which
is
lower
than
market,
then
a
market
price,
and
then
a
ceiling
price
which
is
above
market?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
the
producer
walks
away
when
you
offer
the
market
price,
can't
you
find
other
people
to
buy
from
at
the
market
price?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
see
why
that
is,
ms.
halladay.
if
the
market
price
is
lower
than
the
ceiling
price,
and
the
producer
tells
the
pipeline
to
in
effect
get
lost
after
the
gfn,
why
can't
the
pipeline
go
out
and
buy
at
market?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
true,
and
the
market
won't
be
what
it,
the
same
today
as
it
is
3
months
from
now.
but
i
don't
see
how
that
deflects
the
force
of
the
argument,
at
least
to
me--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you
say
that
is
what
congress--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--which
you,
which
the
pipelines
now
have.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
bottom
line
is
your
time
has
expired,
ms.
halladay.
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
