mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
single
dispositive
point
to
which
the
respondents
have
no
answer
is
that
sections
104
and
106
of
the
ngpa
specifically
and
unequivocally
authorize
the
commission
to
set
a
new
ceiling
price
for
old
gas,
so
long
as
it
is
higher
and
so
long
as
it
is
just
and
reasonable.
and
that
is
all
that
has
happened
here.
that
is
specifically
what
has
happened
here.
and
you
have
to
ask
yourself
then,
under
those
circumstances,
what
is
it
that
ferc
did
that
was
wrong?
our
opponents'
only
real
answer
to
that
is
that
this
amounts
to
de
facto
regulation.
that
is
nothing
more
than
substituting
a
label
for
what
the
statute
says.
moreover,
order
55
did
not
in
fact
deregulate.
what
it
did
was
to
set
a
new
ceiling,
a
higher
ceiling,
just
as
the
statute
requires.
but
regardless
of
what
happens
to
the
market,
in
the
event
that
it
might
go
above
the
ceiling,
that
is
still
a
ceiling
and
therefore
still
a
regulated
price.
the
oft-repeated
assertion
that
the
effect
has
in
fact
been
to
increase
the
prices
of
old
gas
is
totally
beside
the
point.
consumers
do
not
buy
old
gas
as
such,
and
the
price
that
consumers
pay
at
the
burner
tip
for
the
mix
of
old
and
new
gas
that
they
in
fact
buy
has
in
fact
significantly
declined
since
order
451.
and
among
the
reasons
that
this
may
be
the
case
are
those
that
the
commission
itself
predicted,
namely
the
11
trillion
cubic
feet
that
would
be
at
issue
in
the
event
that
order
451
were
not
enacted.
that
has
two
effects
on
the
price.
one
is
it
puts
more
gas
onto
the
market,
and
the
second
is
that
the
increment
that
it
puts
onto
the
market
is
low-priced
to
mix
with
the
higher
price.
the
contention
that
congress
relaxed
the
pricing
structure
only
for
new
gas,
while
carrying
forth
the
existing
vintages
for
old
gas,
and
that
that
was
the
compromise
that
congress
reached,
is
true
as
far
as
it
goes,
but
it
tells
only
half
the
story.
and
the
half
that
it
leaves
out
is
the
half
that
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
it
is
true
that
congress
itself
did
not
alter
the
old
gas
ceilings.
it
simply
carried
them
forth.
but
in
words
that
could
not
be
more
plain,
in
sections
104
and
106,
it
gave
the
commission
the
authority
to
exercise
its
traditional
nga
authority
to
decide
just
and
reasonable
ceilings,
and
to
alter
those
ceilings
in
light
of
subsequently
changed
conditions
in
the
event
it
chose
to
do
so.
so
that
the
only
issue,
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
those
rates
are
just
and
reasonable.
and
it
is
an
issue
that
is
really
not
a
proper
basis
for
invalidating
order
451.
the
commission
determined
that
they
were
just
and
reasonable.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not,
did
not
disturb
that.
and
the
only
argument
that
our
opponents
have
as
to
why
this
is
not
just
and
reasonable
is
the
one
to
which
mr.
kneedler
referred,
that
the
commission
said
it
would
not
be
just
and
reasonable
to
charge
that
price
without
first
going
through
a
negotiation
procedure
whose
ultimate
effect
would
probably
be
and
has
been
to
get
the
price
lower.
the
claim
that
the
commission's
gfn
procedure
is
too
one-sided
simply
ignores
the
central
purpose
of
that
procedure.
the
ceiling
itself
was
borrowed
from
what
congress
itself
did.
moreover,
it
had
been
judicially
approved.
so
clearly,
if
that
is
all
they
had
done,
it
would
have
been
all
right
to
charge
up
to
that
ceiling.
but
they
said
that
was
not
the
just
and
reasonable
procedure.
first,
as
a
condition
to
charging
that
higher
price,
the
producer
was
required
to
initiate
a
procedure
which
might
bring
the
price
lower.
now,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
were
these
price
escalation
charges,
something
like
that
negotiation
process
was
absolutely
essential,
and
in
fact
it
has
worked
very
well.
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
what
has
happened
is
that
the
parties
have
not
used
the
gfn
formal
procedure,
but
rather
have
simply
renegotiated
their
contracts.
and
the
effect
has
been
to
eliminate
not
only
the
distortions
on
the
lower
end,
the
old
gas
price
distortions
over
which
congress,
excuse
me,
the
commission
did
have
some
authority,
but
also
has
been
to
bring
the
producers
to
the
bargaining
table
and
put
the
new
gas
on
the
bargaining
table
as
well.
now,
the
second
major
issue
in
the
case
concerns
what
kind
of
hearing
is
due
under
section
7(b).
we
submit
at
the
outset
that
this
falls
well
within
the
vermont
yankee
rule,
that
agencies
enjoy
particular
deference
with
respect
to
their
own
procedures.
there
is
a
very
good
reason
why
the
hearing
that
was
due
in
this
case
was
not
the
individualized
one
that
the
respondents
advocate.
and
that
reason
is
bottomed
on
the
ferc's
governing
substantive
standard
for
abandonments,
which
is
not
challenged
here.
the
old
standard,
which
focused
on
the
comparative
needs
of
the
two
prospective
parties
to
the
contract,
that
is
the
one
that
would,
then
had
the
gas
and
the
one
that
would
get
the
gas
in
the
event
of
abandonment,
necessarily
concentrated
on
the
needs
of
the
individual
parties.
but
the
new
standard
is
concerned
not
with
comparative
needs,
but
rather
with
the
overall
needs
of
the
market.
and
as
a
result,
the
hearing
that
ferc
held
was
not
concerned
with
any
facts
relevant
to
particular
companies
or
particular
contracts,
but
rather
with
overall
market
needs.
the
respondents
have
never
really...
well,
they
do
not
dispute
the
substantive
standard,
nor
do
they
dispute
that
that
substantive
standard
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
but
they
have
never
faced
up
to
the
interaction,
the
bearing
that
that
unchallenged
substantive
standard
has
on
the
procedural
argument
that
they
are
making
in
this
case.
finally,
the
court
has
held
on
several
occasions
that
generic
hearings
do
satisfy
the
statutory
requirement
that
there
be
a
hearing,
and
that
is
particularly
appropriate
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
the
statute
says
due
hearing.
and
that
language
is,
by
its
nature
implies
a
great
deal
of
discretion
in
the
commission
in
determining
what
kind
of
a
hearing
is
due.
what
mr.
kneedler
said
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
whether
there
would
be
opportunity
for
not
only
consideration
by
the
commission,
but
also
the
hearing,
even
if
we
assume
that
an
individualized
hearing
is
required,
which
has
not
been
decided
really,
and
even
if
we
assume
that
the
commission
wouldn't
grant
it...
and
that
has
not
yet
been
determined,
that
issue
ought
to
be
decided,
if
at
all,
at
such
time
that
anyone
actually
asks
for
a
hearing...
then
you
still
have
the
question,
or
you
still
have
the
point
that
the
proper
remedy
is
simply
to
let
them
go
back,
and
if
they
are
entitled
to
a
hearing,
then
ferc
will
be
entitled,
ferc
will
be
obligated
to
give
them
a
hearing.
but
you
don't
upset
the
entire
pricing
provisions
of
order
451
for
that
reason.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
