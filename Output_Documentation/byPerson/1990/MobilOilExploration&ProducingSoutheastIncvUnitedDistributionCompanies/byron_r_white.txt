justice
white
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
agree
with
the
statement
i
see
in
the
brief
on
the
other
side,
the
commission
has
admitted
that
the
new
ceiling
price
for
old
gas
would
not
be
just
and
reasonable
if
it
were
actually
collected?
justice
white
what
do
they
mean,
if
it
were
actually
collected?
justice
white
well,
it
sounds
like
you
do
agree
with
the
statement.
justice
white
you
mean
this
contractually,
it
wouldn't
be
fair.
justice
white
well,
do
you...
are
there
escalator
clauses
in
your
clients'
contracts?
justice
white
and
what
do
they
mean?
that
if
the,
that
the
price
charged
under
the
contract
can
be
escalated
right
up
to
a
ceiling
price?
justice
white
i
would
think,
i
would
think
you
would
like
to
get
out
of
that
contract...
if
the
market
is
lower,
if--
justice
white
--well,
that
may
be,
but
under...
i
suppose
under
your
contract
you
would,
if
the
producer
said,
pay
me
the
ceiling
price
or
else,
you
are
supposed
to
pay
it,
aren't
you?
justice
white
well,
yes,
but
if
the
producer
has
said
to
your
clients
either
pay
the
ceiling
price
or
not,
or
the
contract
is
cancelled,
i
suppose
you
would
prefer
the
contract
was
cancelled.
justice
white
well,
what
instances
wouldn't
you,
if
you--
justice
white
--because
if
the
contract
is
cancelled,
you
can
automatically
go
get
gas
at
the
market.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but...
are
you
saying
then
you
would
stick
to
the
contract
and
pay
the
ceiling
price?
justice
white
well,
it
looks
to
me
like
the
good
faith
negotiation
provision
is
really
in
your
favor.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
there
hadn't
been
that
process
provided
for
and...
why,
the
producer
can,
is
in
charge
anyway.
he
can
just
say
pay
up
to
the
ceiling
or
not.
if
you
want
out,
why,
get
out.
justice
white
when
did...
wait
a
minute.
justice
white
what
is
the
basis
for
that
statement?
justice
white
you
mean
the
ceiling
price?
justice
white
well,
if
the
market,
if
you
say
the
commission
really
deregulated
it
and
said
the
market
is
going
to
set
the
price
for
old
gas,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
white
and
they
deregulated
new
gas--
justice
white
--well,
all
right.
so
it,
so...
i
would
suppose
new
gas
is
going
to
be
sold
at
the
market,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
why...
if
the
market
is
determining
both
kinds
of
gas,
why
do
you
say
old
gas
is,
in
the
marketplace
is
getting
a
higher
price
than
new
gas?
justice
white
well,
why
would
it?
why
would
it,
if
it
is
set
by
market
forces--
justice
white
--i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't--
