justice
scalia
would
that
petition
necessarily
be
given
a
hearing?
justice
scalia
so
if
i
think
that
the,
that
the
word
hearing
in
7(b)
in
that
context
requires
an
individualized
hearing,
it
is
not
your
contention
that
this
waiver
procedure
through
petition
would
necessarily
satisfy
it?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
say
the
waiver,
the
waiver
procedure
is
available,
but
you
are
not
arguing
that
that
necessarily
fulfills
the
requirement,
if
there
is
one,
which
you
contend
there
is
not,
of
an
individualized
hearing.
justice
scalia
what
about
the
other
10
percent
that
didn't
have
an
escalator
clause?
doesn't
this--
justice
scalia
--doesn't
this
provision
apply
to
them?
justice
scalia
well,
congress
decided
that
that
should
happen
at
the
moment
when
it
passed
its
legislation.
but
it
did
not
decide
that
that
should
never
happen,
did
it?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
does
that
appear
anywhere
in
the
statute?
i,
i
would
think
from
the
way
the
crucial
provision
is
worded,
that
congress
essentially
said
right
now
we
are
not
going
to
do
it,
but
we
are
not
taking
away
the
power
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
to
do
it.
justice
scalia
overall
it
has
succeeded
in
doing
that.
i
mean,
the
overwhelming
record
is
that
it
has
been
a
success
in
that
objective,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
it
does
have
these
teeth
at
least.
if
you
have
a
gas
sales
contract
that
is
binding
on
both
parties
that
has
an
escalator
clause,
you
could
charge
above
that
ceiling
price
and
impose
it
on
the
purchaser.
but
because
of
the
ceiling
price
you
can't.
doesn't
it
have
at
least
that
constraint
upon
the
parties
that
operate
under
it?
justice
scalia
well,
whatever
the
future
holds,
it's
a
truism
that
you
can
always
buy
a
commodity
at
the
market
price.
isn't
that
a
truism?
that
defines
the
market
price.
it's
what
you
can
buy
it
at.
justice
scalia
unless
perhaps
the
commission
wanted
it
to.
i
mean,
it
retained
the
commission's
authority
to
prevent
the
market
from
being
the
determinant,
but
it
didn't,
it
didn't
command
that
the
market
not
be
the
determinant.
justice
scalia
what,
what
use
would
it
be
for
an
individual
party
to
participate,
unless
he
is
contradicting
one
of
the,
compliance
with
one
of
the
general
requirements
that
the
commission
has
set
forth
by
rule.
what
purpose
would
there
be?
the
commission
has
set
forth
we
are
going
to
grant
all
abandonments
if
a,
b,
and
c
occur.
unless
the
party
comes
forward
and
says
a,
b,
and
c
does
not
exist,
what
use
is
there
for
the
private
party?
justice
scalia
isn't
the
commission
entitled
to
set
forth
the
conditions
on
which
it
will
permit
abandonment?
i
think
it...
doesn't
the
commission
always
have
to
do
that?
justice
scalia
whether
by
rule
or
by
adjudication,
it
is
going
to
set
forth
criteria
for
abandonment.
it
can't
act
willy-nilly.
justice
scalia
--ms.
halladay,
congress
wanted
this
great
disparity
in
the
prices
and
the
much
higher
price
for
new
gas
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
which
was
a
time
of
severe
gas
shortage.
justice
scalia
which
has
been
transformed
in,
or
was
transformed
into
a
period
of
gas
glut,
was
it
not?
justice
scalia
and
this
is
what
the,
what
the
commission
is
doing,
is
scrambling
to
take
account
of
those
vastly
altered,
of
that
vastly
altered
situation.
which
congress
allowed
it
to
do
by
giving
it,
although
it
said
we
won't
deregulate,
if
you
want
to
use
that
word,
old
gas
now,
congress,
in
the
sections
that
are
central
to
this
case,
did
not
take
away
the
power
of
the
commission
to
do
that.
and
it
may
be
a
good
thing,
because
the
whole
situation
changed.
justice
scalia
you
think
it's
a
good
thing
that
there
should
still
be
a
great
incentive
for
the
production
of
new
gas
as
opposed
to
old
gas,
so
that
the
glut
can
be,
can
get
even
bigger?
justice
scalia
that's
the--
justice
scalia
--that's
the
condition
you
want
to
perpetuate?
justice
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
could
you
explain
the
apparent
contradiction
that
the
commission
says
a
ceiling
price
is
just
and
reasonable
but
does
not
allow
it
to
be
charged--
justice
scalia
--without
later
negotiation.
how
come
is
that?
justice
scalia
it
says
the
ceiling
is
within
the
zone--
justice
scalia
--i
have
no
problem
with
that.
right.
justice
scalia
you
think
the
commission
could
do
that
to
rates?
i
mean,
can
it
say
$30
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
so
long
as
somebody
is
willing
to
pay
that?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
is
that
the
definition
of
a
just
and
reasonable
rate?
justice
scalia
if
you
can
coerce
somebody
into
paying
it,
it
is
just
and
reasonable.
otherwise
it
is
not.
