mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
struck
down
a
rule
adopted
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
in
1986
to
eliminate
the
substantial
market
distortions
and
inequities
among
consumers
that
resulted
from
the
prior
system
of
vintage
pricing
for
old
gas.
old
natural
gas
is
gas
that
was
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978.
although
the
regulatory
history
and
market
context
of
this
case
may
be
somewhat
complex,
the
case
boils
down
to
straightforward
questions
of
statutory
construction.
on
each
we
submit
the
text
of
the
act
clearly
authorizes
the
commission
to
do
what
it
did,
but
if
there
were
any
question
on
that,
the
commission's
actions,
in
our
view,
rest
on
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
act.
let
me
identify
at
the
outset
the
two
issues
that
are
presented
here,
principal
issues.
first
is
what
i
will
refer
to
as
the
pricing
issue.
sections
104
and
106
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
authorize
the
commission
by
rule
or
order
to
raise
the
ceiling
price
of
any
gas
or
any
category
of
gas,
as
long
as
the
commission
finds
that
the
higher
price
is
"just
and
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
natural
gas
act.
"
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
language
did
not
authorize
the
commission
to
depart
from
the
prior
vintage
pricing
system
for
old
gas,
but
instead
permitted
the
commission
only
to
grant
special
relief
from
applicable
ceilings
where
it
believed
warranted.
the
court
ignored
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutory
text,
which
contemplates
price
increases
of
general
applicability.
but
beyond
that,
it
also
ignored
the
broad
and
flexible
interpretation
given
to
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
by
the
commission,
by
this
court
in
its
classic
rate
making
cases,
hope
natural
gas,
permian
basin,
and
mobil
oil,
and
by
the
lower
courts
immediately
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
and
the
incorporation
of
that
language
into
the
act.
the
second
issue
concerns
the
abandonment
of
service
under
order
451.
the
court
of
appeals
found
fault
with
the
provision
in
order
451
that
permits
a
producer
of
gas
to
abandon
its
sales
to
a
pipeline
or
other
purchaser
where
the
purchaser
is
unwilling,
after
negotiations,
to
pay
a
higher
price
for
old
gas
allowed
by
the
order.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there...
the
commission's
regulations
specific...
the
answer
is
yes.
the
commission's
regulations
specifically
provide
for
the
filing
of
complaints,
and
if
a
purchaser
objected
to
a
proposed
abandonment
on
the
grounds
that
the
standards
prescribed
in
order
451
have
not
been
met
in
the
particular
case,
it
could
file
a
complaint
and
seek
an
adjudication
of
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that
is,
that
is
clearly
our
position.
let
me,
let
me
just
explain
the
setting
for
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
the
commission...
the
standard
for
abandonment
under
section
7(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
the
commission
may
authorize
abandonment
if
it
concludes
that
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
or
necessity
warrants
the
abandonment.
and
it
also
says
after
due
hearing.
and
what
the
commission
concluded
here
that
it
was,
that
upon
the
occurrence
of
certain
conditions
subsequent,
a
producer
would
be
authorized
to
abandon
the
gas
service.
so
what
the
commission
did
was
give
particular
content
to
the
general
statutory
standard
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
in
order
451
itself.
and
this
court
has
held
in
numerous
cases
that
an
agency,
and
particularly
the
commission's
predecessor,
the
fpc,
may
do
that
under
the
natural
gas
act.
and
then,
upon
the
occurrence
of
those,
satisfaction
of
those
standards,
the
producer
is
permitted
to
abandon
the
sale
of
gas.
there
is,
the
pipeline
has
no
right
to
an
individualized
hearing
on
the
general
standards
that
were
promulgated
by
rule,
because
the
pipelines
and
others
had
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
hearing
afforded
by
that
rule
making.
what
could
be
challenged
in
a
complaint
is
whether
the
producer
satisfied
those
conditions.
now
there
has
also
been
a
question
raised
as
to
whether
there
might
be
an
opportunity
for
waiver
of
the
general
standards
under
the
rule,
and
that
is
a
procedure
that
has
been
referred
to
in
several
of
this
court's
cases
discussing
general
stan...
abandonment
or
similar,
not
abandonment,
but
similar
generalized
determinations
under
which
parties
may
obtain
rights.
and
the
court
has
discussed
those
in
several
other
cases,
storer
and
fpc
v.
texaco.
but...
in
wncn,
for
example,
the
court
noted
that
it
had
not
resolved
the
question
of
whether
a
provision
for
waiver
would
be
necessary.
and
in
fact
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
in
the
context
of
this
case,
because
what
triggers
the
opportunity
for
abandonment
under
this,
under
order
451,
is
the
purchaser's
refusal
to
pay
the
rate
requested
by
the
pipe,
by
the
producer
up
to
the
new
ceiling
prescribed
by
order
451.
in
other
words,
what
triggers
abandonment
under
this
order
is
a
purchaser's
refusal
to
pay
a
rate
of
general
applicability
that
the
commission
has
prescribed.
the
rates
are,
by
their
nature,
items
of
general
applicability
that
do
not
require,
at
least
short
of
constitutional
insufficiency,
the
opportunity
for
waivers
or
special
exceptions,
as
under
permian
basin.
so
we
don't
believe
that,
that
the
nature,
intrinsic
nature
of
order
451
and
the
pricing
schedule,
or
ceiling
set
in
place
by
that
requires
an
opportunity
for
a
waiver.
but
if
a
pipeline
or
other
purchaser
thought
that
a
waiver
was
nevertheless
appropriate,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
purchaser
would
have
an
opportunity
to
file
a
petition
under
the
general
rules
governing
the
filing
of
petitions
under
the
commission's
regulations.
and
in
fact,
williams
natural
gas
argued
in
the
court
below
that
the
commission
had
authority
under
section
16
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
grant
a
waiver
from
the
provisions
of
order
451
in
appropriate
circumstances.
although
williams
made
a
passing
request
for
an
exemption
or
waiver
in
its
rehearing
petition
in
these
rule
making
proceedings
before
the
commission,
that
is
not
the
right
place
for
an
individual
pipeline
or
purchaser
to
request
an
exception.
the
proper
procedure
is
to
file
a
petition
with
the
commission,
where
the
commission
can
focus
on
the
equities
of
the
particular
purchaser,
outside
of
the
context
of
adopting
a
rule
of
general
applicability.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that
what
would
be
required
is
that
the,
that
the
purchaser
would
at
least
have
to
make
a
showing
of
pretty
substantial
reasons
why
an
exception
should
be
made
to
the
general
standards
in
order
451.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
i
think
the
place--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
not
across
the
board.
but
in
the
context
of
this
case,
again
going
back
to
what
this
court
said
in
fpc
v.
texaco,
which
concerned
the
same
sort
of
argument
about
a
right
to
a
hearing
under
section
7(c)
of
the
natural
gas
act;
and
what
the
court
said,
it
was
fine
for
the
commission
to
weed
out
at
the
threshold,
solely
by
virtue
of
not
satisfying
the
standards
and
the
rule
adopted
by
the
commission,
various
private
entities
were
applying
for
special
relief.
but
it
left
open
the
possibility
of
applying
for
a
waiver.
i
think
the
same
thing
would
apply
here.
what
the
pipeline
could
not
contest
in
such
a
hearing
is
the
general
standards
set
forth
in
the
rule
itself,
because
again,
those
were
adopted
after
due
hearing
in
the
rule
making
proceeding
on
the
order
itself,
which
is
again
the
conclusion
the
court
reached
in
fpc
v.
texaco.
what
the
pipeline
could
request
in
such
a
waiver
application
would
be
to
show
that
his
particular
condition
so
departed
from
the
premises
of
the
order
that
special
relief
was
warranted.
now
again,
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
speak
on
behalf
of
the
commission
as
to
what
its
response
would
be
to
a
particular
waiver
application.
my
only
point
here
is
that
the
commission's
regulations
do
not
foreclose
it,
and
that
none
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
has
pursued
the
procedure
that
would
be
appropriate
under
the
commission's
regulations
to
present
that
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
in
fact,
under
the
good
faith
negotiation
procedure
set
up
by
the
commission
in
order
451,
the
producer
cannot
abandon,
may
not
abandon
until
it
has
entered
into
a
contract
with
another
purchaser
to
purchase
that
same
gas.
and
the
commission
deemed
this
to
be
an
important
protection
in
the
public
interest,
public
convenience
and
necessity,
because
it
assures
that
the
gas
will
be,
will
remain
in
the
market
and
not
be
lost
forever.
and
it
is
that
purpose
that
in
our
view
lends
considerable
support
to
the
commission's
approach.
because
not
only,
not
only
has
the
commission
determined
from
the
overall
needs
of
the
market
that
it's
proper
to
release
that
gas
to
a
new
purchaser
under
the
circumstances,
but
even
comparing
the
two
competing
purchasers,
as
it
were,
the
existing
purchaser
and
the
new
purchaser,
the
commission
has
concluded
that
the,
if
the
new
purchaser
is
propared
to
pay
more,
or
under
more
favorable
circumstances
for
that
particular
gas,
that
the,
that
as
between
those
two
purchasers,
the
subsequent
purchaser,
market
indications
show,
has
a
greater
need
for
it.
and
that...
the
court,
again
in
wncn
v.
fcc,
concluded
that
it
is
proper
in
circumstances
for
an
agency
to
rely
on
the
market
to
resolve
questions
of
comparative
need,
or
in
that
case,
diversity
of
programming.
and
so
it
is...
and
the
commission
made
that
point
on
rehearing,
relying
on
wncn,
that
it
is
really
the
same
sort
of
comparative
needs
of
the
two
pipelines.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
we
do
not.
the
commission,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
commission
repeatedly
and
explicitly
said
that
the
new
ceiling
is
just
and
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
natural
gas
act.
and
in
fact
what
the
commission
did
was
set
that
ceiling
at
the
same
level
as
was
already
applicable
to
one
of
the
ceilings
for
post-1974
gas.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
again,
this
ties
into
this
good
faith
negotiation
procedure.
although
the
commission
determined
that
the
rate
which
was
carried
forward
by
statute
for
one
category
was
just
and
reasonable,
it
concluded
that
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
for
a
producer
to
automatically
collect
that
higher
rate
under
particular
contract
provisions
that
many
pipelines
and
producers
had
entered
into.
now,
let
me
explain
how
that
works.
90
percent
of
contracts
between--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no,
what
we
don't
agree--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
wouldn't
be
fair...
this
rule
was
in
fact
set
up
for
the
protection
of
respondents
and
pipelines
and
consumers,
not
for
the
protection
of
producers.
but
beyond
that
the
commission
concluded
it
would
not
make
sense
for
the
market
as
a
whole.
let
me
explain
why
that
is
so.
the
90
percent...
90
percent
of
the
contracts
between
producers
and
pipelines
contained
contract
provisions,
typically
indefinite
price
escalator
clauses,
that
would
have
allowed
the
price
the
pipeline
was
required
to
pay
under
existing
contracts
to
rise
to
the
new
ceiling
level.
that
new
ceiling
level
was
and
is
above
the
market
price.
and
the
commission
concluded
that
the
market
distortions
it
was
trying
to
eliminate
by
raising
the
ceiling
would
be
reintroduced
if
the
market,
if
the
price
of
old
gas
went
from
substantially
below
the
market
to
substantially
above
the
market,
and
that
it
would
also
be
appropriate
to
mitigate
the
impact
on
individual
pipelines.
and
so
what
the
commission
did
was
to
say
that
as
a
prerequisite
to
collecting
this
higher
rate,
the
producer
would
have
to
trigger
negotiations
with
the
pipeline
to
enter
into
a
mutually
agreed
upon
price.
only
if
the
pipeline
refuses
to
pay
a
price
up
to
the
ceiling
would
abandonment
occur.
in
other
words,
only
if
the
pipeline
refused
to
pay
a
price
that
it
was
contractually
obligated
to
pay
under
the
escalator
clauses
could
abandonment
occur.
and
so,
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals'
view
of
the
good
faith
negotiation
system,
this
is
not
one-sided
or
unfavorable
to
the,
to
the
pipelines.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
does
not.
if...
under
this
court's
mobil
sierra
doctrine
as
incorporated
in
section
101(b)(9)
of
the
act,
the
contract
price
controls.
and
if
there
is
no
provision
in
the
contract
between
the
producer
and
the
pipeline
to
increase
the
prices,
there
is
no
contractual
authority
and
no
right
of
the
producer
to
charge
the
higher
price.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
the
reason
that
is
so
is
because
the
commission
con...
this
price
is
based
on
calculations
the
commission
did
in
1974,
which
have
been
updated
over
time
by
inflation.
it's
an
estimate
of
the
replacement
cost,
the
long-term
replacement
cost
of
these
supplies
of
old
gas.
the
current
spot
market
for
old,
for
gas
generally
is
below
that
long-term
replacement
cost,
but
that
doesn't
detract
from
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
ceiling
the
commission
has
prescribed.
and
in
fact,
the
commission
also
concluded,
strongly
reinforcing
this,
that
the
new
price
ceiling
and
allowing
the
prices
to
increase
would
elicit
11
trillion
cubic
feet
of
additional
supplies
of
old
gas,
which
would
compete
with
new
gas,
bring
down
prices,
and
stabilize
the
market.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
o'connor
is
correct.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutory
text
here
answers
the
question.
the
commission
is
expressly
authorized
to
increase
ceiling
prices
if
they
are
found
to
be
just
and
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
commission
doesn't
prohibit--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
first
of
all,
what
the
natural
gas
act
provides,
allows
the
commission
to
set
a
rate
within
a
zone
of
reasonableness,
as
the
commission
has
said
in
permian
basin.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
ceiling
was
within
the
zone
and
certainly
the
market,
the
current
market
price
is
within
the
zone.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
what
the
commission
has
said
is
that
because
automatic
collection
of
the
higher
price,
not
that
it
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
in
the
abstract,
but
that
automatically
allowing
producers
to
charge
rates
above
the
market
would
distort
the
market,
and
therefore
not
be
just
and
reasonable
within
the
context
of
a
rule
that
is
trying
to
bring
order
and
regularity
to
the
market.
that's,
that's
the
reason
why
the
commission
has
concluded
that.
the
commission
can
regulate
practices
as
well
as
prices,
and
what
the
commission
has
done
here--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no.
there
is
another
point
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
because
there
is
an
important
limitation
here,
and
it
is
also
the
complete
answer
to
the
respondents'
position
that
this
price
is
deregulated.
the
commission
did
not
pull
the
price
out
of
thin
air.
the
price,
the
ceiling
that
all
of
this
gas
is
subject
to
is
the
ceiling
price
for
post-1974
old
gas,
which
was
carried
forward
by
congress
itself
in
the
ngpa.
that
is
a
statutorily,
statutory
touchstone
for
this
ceiling.
also,
it
is
important
to
reinforce
the
point
that
the
chief
justice
made.
if,
if
pipelines
cannot
purchase
gas
from
the
current
producer,
they
can
go
out
and
get
it
at
market
from
other
producers.
respondents
have
not
identified
any
pipeline
that
has
been
unable
to
replace
supplies
by
going
to
the
market.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no.
the
subsequent
abandonment
that
is
authorized
is
if
the
producer
then
chooses
to
sell
it
to
yet
a
third
pipeline.
that's
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
commission's
position
on
that
is
that
its
jurisdiction
does
not
extend
to
additional
productions
of
gas
from
wells,
that
that
is
subject
to
state
jurisdiction.
the
commission
set
that
forth
in
the
northwest
central
pipeline
case.
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
commission
concluded
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
price
incentive,
to
encourage
producers
to
continue
to
produce
old
gas.
otherwise
11
trillion
feet
of
natural
gas
would
have
been
lost,
the
commission
determined,
to
the
market.
respondents
do
not
challenge
that
determination
by
the
commission,
and
has
exhaustively
talked--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
this
is...
this
speaks
of
abandonment
of
sales.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
again,
only
in
circumstances
where
the,
where
the
pipeline
is
unwilling
to
pay
the
market-responsive
price
and
a
price
that
it
is
obligated
to
pay
by
contract.
i
should
also
point
out
that
this
has
been
a
hugely
successful
order.
the
market
price
of
old
gas
at
the
end
of
1989
exactly
equaled
the
market
price
of
gas
generally,
$1.69
per
thousand
cubic
feet.
what
this,
this
order
has
been
a
success
in
eliminating
the
distortions
and
the
unfairness
among
consumers,
and
the
long-time
disparity
with
respect
to
replacement
cost,
and
bringing
this
sort
of
order
to
a
nationwide
market
that
congress
wanted
to
have
when
it
enacted
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
this
court
said
that
the
commission's
goal
under
that
act
is
to
assure
adequate
supplies
at
fair
prices.
and
surely
a
regulatory
system
that
requires,
in
the
end,
pipelines
to
pay
what
the
market
will
bear
and
producers
to
charge
what
the
market
will
bear,
with
a
touchstone
to
the
market
pricing
system
that
congress
set
loose
in
the
natural
gas
policy
act
itself,
is
fair
and
it
is
also,
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
just
and
reasonable.
