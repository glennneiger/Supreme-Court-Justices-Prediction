mr.
kneedler,
perhaps
it
isn't
significant,
but
we
are
talking
about
kind
of
an
abandonment
of
a
particular
customer,
rather
than
abandonment
of
service
in
the
sense
of
the
supply
of
gas
is,
doesn't
come
off
the
market,
it
just
goes
to
some
other
purchaser,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
kneedler,
it
is
true,
just
following
up
on
justice
white's
question,
that
the
ceiling
price
is
presumably
above
the
market
price
for
most
of
the
old
gas,
and
that
that
price
is
nevertheless,
in
your
view,
just
and
reasonable?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
which
it
has
succeeded
in
doing.
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
can
you
help
me
on
one
concept
on
the
abandonment
part
of
the
case?
is
it
correct
that
under
the
rule
that
really
two
abandonments
are
approved
on
a
wholesale
basis?
first,
the
shift
to
a
different
pipeline
purchaser,
and
then
the
subsequent
abandonment
when
the
producer
decides
to
go,
to
discontinue
production.
are
both
stages
approved--
justice
stevens
--what
if
the
producer
decides
that
it's
no
longer
economic
to
produce
gas
from
that
particular
well?
justice
stevens
so
this
order
doesn't,
this
order
just
doesn't
deal
with
the
problem
of
abandonment
that
we
normally
think
of
in
other
regulatory
contexts
of
discontinuing
production?
justice
stevens
okay.
