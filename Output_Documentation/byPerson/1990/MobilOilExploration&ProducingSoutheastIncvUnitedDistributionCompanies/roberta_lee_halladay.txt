ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
not
a
basic
rate
case.
this
case
involves
an
effort
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
to
overturn
the
pricing
and
regulatory
policies
for
natural
gas
prescribed
by
congress
in
precise
and
detailed
language
set
forth
in
the
natural
gas
policy
act
and
the
natural
gas
act.
in
order
no.
451
the
commission
has
taken
three
interrelated
actions
that
are
directly
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
those
statutes.
first,
the
commission
upset
the
pricing
policy
of
congress
embodied
in
title
i
of
the
ngpa
by
placing
significant
incentives
for
additional
production
of
old
gas
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
displacing
any
further
development
of
new
gas.
second,
the
commission
removed
virtually
entirely
any
kind
of
regulatory
rate
control
over
old
gas,
and
stated
repeatedly
in
order
no.
451
that
the
purpose
it
had
taken
its
action
was
to
allow
gas
to
be
priced
by
the
market,
that
is
deregulate
it.
and
finally,
the
commission
surrendered
to
the
marketplace
the
very
specific
statutory
responsibilities
it
long
had
held
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
that
congress
had
expressly
preserved
in
the
natural
gas
policy
act
to
regulate
the
sale
and
abandonment
of
gas
sold
to
the
interstate
market.
in
vacating
order
no.
451,
the
fifth
circuit
closely
examined
the
language,
history,
and
purposes
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
natural
gas
policy
act.
it
then
looked
to
the
actual
end
result
of
order
no.
451
and
determined
that
the
commission
had
taken
an
action
that
only
congress
could
take
or
that
only
congress
could
authorize
the
commission
to
take,
namely
to
deregulate
old
gas
and
to
remove
all
remaining
controls
on
the
sale
and
abandonment
of
that
gas
to
the
market.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
it
cannot
be
the
end
of
it
unless,
of
course,
we
ignore
the
statute
as
a
whole.
now
what
should
be
made
clear
at
first
is
that
sections
104(b)(2)
and
106(c)
did
not
just
carry
forward
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
making
authority
that
the
commission
previously
had
had
in
the
natural
gas
act.
it
changed
that
authority
by
stating
that
the
commission
could
only
raise
rates.
it
did
not
allow
them
to
lower
rates.
in
the
past,
when
the
commission
could
raise
or
lower,
it
could
take
a
much
more
involved
role
in
trying
to
make
gas
market-responsive.
the
limitation
of
its
authority
only
to
raise
rates
suggests
that
congress
had
some
different
purpose
in
mind
than
in
the
past.
the
second
thing
is,
the
commission
itself
repeatedly
interpreted
this
provision
to
state
that
it
required
that,
it
provided
an
outlet,
rather,
for
those
producers
whose
actual
costs
of
production
exceeded
the
average
ceiling
prices
set
by
congress,
and
thereby
would,
without
relief,
have
a
constitutional,
unconstitutional
compensation
through
property.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
it
can
change
its
mind.
it
can't
change
congress'
mind,
and
here
that
is
what
they
did.
congress
decided
that
there
should
not
be
great
incentives
placed
on
the
incentives
of
old
gas,
that
incentives
should
be
given
to
new
and
hard-to-produce
gas,
because
that
is
precisely
where
new
sources
of
supply
would
come
to
the
market.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
i
think--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--and
yet
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
also
ruled
in
order
72
that
one
of
the
key
components
of
the
overall
pricing
scheme
of
the
ngpa
had
been
the
continued
availability
of
sections
104
and
106
to
old
gas.
now
what
the
commission
has
done
here
in
order
451
is
it
has
melded
together
approximately
one-half
of
all
of
the
pricing
categories
that
congress
established,
and
it
has
set
a
rate
that
is
equal
to
an
incentive
rate
the
commission
set
under
another
provision
of
the
ngpa,
107(c)(5).
now
that
provision
states
that
the
commission
can
only
when
it
is
reasonably
necessary
set
a
new
incentive
based
price
for
gas
in
this,
in
the
107(c)(5)
case,
that
is
produced
at
extraordinary
cost
or
risk.
and
in
a
prior
proceeding
the
commission
determined
that
the
ceiling
price
now
set
here
in
order
451
represented
such
an
incentive
price.
now
they
say
for
gas
that
they
admit
is
low-cost
in
production
and
does
not
involve
extraordinary
risk,
it
should
get
the
same
incentive.
and
it
has
thereby
read
107(c)(5)
right
out
of
the
act.
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
whatever
authority
the
commission
had
in
sections
104(b)(2)
and
106(c),
and
they
previously
had
said
it
was
a
special
relief
mechanism,
they
also
have
very
clearly
stated
that
it
is
not
the
authority
to
deregulate
the
price
of
gas.
and
that
is
in
fact
what
they
have
done
in
this
case,
and
let
me
explain
why.
there
is
no
doubt
in
this
case
that
there
are
no
effective
controls
presently
on
the
market
actually
setting
the
price
of
old
gas.
the
commission
has
admitted
as
much
in
its
reply
brief.
it
stated
that
at
the
present
time,
and
i
would
submit,
and
the
record
establishes
this,
that
since
the
rule
was
adopted
this
ceiling
price
has
had
no
teeth.
it
cannot
control
what
happens.
it
allows
the
market
to
set
the
rate,
and
that
is
assuming
if
the
gfn
process
works
as
intended.
but
as
mr.
kneedler
pointed
out,
the
only
way
that
a
pipeline
can
be
assured
of
actually
keeping
the
supply
of
gas
under
contract
is
to
agree
to
pay
a
price
that
the
commission
itself
stated
would
be
unjust
and
unreasonable
if
automatically
collected.
now
in
making
that--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--is
the
new
ceiling
price--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--there
have
been,
as
mr.
kneedler
pointed
out,
a
number
of
negotiations.
we
don't
even
have
record
of
all
of
them,
because
in
many
cases
they
don't
have
to
file
anymore
with
the
commission
what
happens.
but
there
are
in
some
instances
voluntary
negotiations
that
have
been
at
a
market
price,
in
other
words
a
price
that
would
have
been
established
had
this
gas
been
deregulated.
however,
there
are
many
other
instances
where
pipelines,
some
of
whom
are
respondents
in
this
proceeding,
have
offered
to
pay
the
market
price
and
the
producer
has
come
back
and
stated
that
is
not
sufficient,
and
then
cancelled
the
contract.
now,
there
is
another
point
that
bears
repeating
here,
and
that
is
that
the
agreement
to
actually
pay
the
market
price
does
not
mean
that
any
new
gas
will
be
produced
from
these
existing
production
reserves.
that
of
course
was
the
whole
point
of
the
rule
making,
was
to
bring
an
additional
11
tcf
to
the
market.
but
if
any
change
in
the
contract
term
is
offered
by
the
pipeline
purchaser,
that
can
be
grounds
for
the
termination
of
the
contract
by
the
producer.
so
if
the
pipeline
purchaser
states
to
the
producer
that
i
will
pay
the
new
ceiling
price,
that
is
admittedly
now
nearly
twice
the
spot
market
price
for
gas,
but
in
return
for
that
agreement
i
would
ask
that
you
agree
to
actually
produce
more
gas
from
these
reserves,
that
could
be
viewed
as
a
change
in
contract
terms
and
it
would
enable
the
producer
to
walk
away
from
the
contract.
furthermore,
nothing
in
this
rule
even
requires
the
producer
to
actually
produce
any
more
gas.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
in
many
cases
the
prices
were
lower
than
market.
they
had--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--yes,
quite
grossly
above
the
market
ever
since
the
rule
was
adopted.
and
the
commission's
theory
was
that
it
could
help
to
resolve
some
regional
disparities
by
bringing
the
gas
closer
to
market-responsive
levels.
now,
the
interesting
thing
is
that
congress--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--it
has
in
some
cases
succeeded
in
doing
that--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--yes,
but
now,
if
that
is
true,
it
is
interesting
because
precise
language
in
section
121
of
the
act
stated
where
congress
intended
to
deregulate
and
where
it
did
not
intend
to
price
deregulate.
and
primarily
it
chose
to
deregulate
new
and
hard-to-produce
gas,
and
let
them
be
market-responsive.
it
did
not
include
old
gas.
moreover,
in
this
rule
making
the
department
of
justice
proposed
as
an
alternative
to
the
procedure
actually
adopted
that
the
commission
simply
allow
the
parties
to
negotiate
in
the
market
any
price
that
they
wanted,
and
then
once
they
negotiated
it,
simply
file
it
with
the
commission.
and
if
they
couldn't
agree,
then
under
the
department
of
justice
proposal,
the
producer
would
then
file
and
seek
expedited
abandonment
of
the
contract.
so,
as
we
will
see
later,
the
producer
actually
in
that
case
had
a
greater
burden
to
comply
with
the
abandonment
requirements
than
what
the
commission
required
in
order
451.
but
the
commission
rejected
that
justice
department
proposal
on
the
specific
grounds
that
it
had
authority
to
allow
the
market
to
set
the
rates.
so
what
did
it
do?
it
turned
right
around
and
did
the
same
thing.
and
the
only
difference
between
the
purportedly
unlawful...
or
the,
no,
the
actual
unlawful
action
that
found
the
department
of
justice
had
proposed,
and
what
did
here
was
to
set
some
ceiling
price.
but,
as
the
department
of
energy
recently
stated,
any
ceiling
price
that
is
this
far
above
the
market
effectively
deregulat
the
gas.
it
cannot
have
teeth,
as
the
commission
states.
it
achieves
the
same
deregulatory
result
that
the
commission
found
in
order
451
it
had
no
power
to
take.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
the
commission,
of
course,
that
is
its
position.
the
interesting
thing
is
that
in
all
prior
proceedings
these
automatic
escalator
clauses
in
fact
had
operated
to
permit
collection
of
the
new
rate.
here
the
commission
found
that
they
had
done
something
quite
different.
this
was
a
new
animal.
they
had
set
a
rate
so
high
and
far
above
the
market
that
they
could
not
follow
the
normal
pattern
of
conduct
that
had
been
followed
in
the
past,
and
let
the
contracts
operate
as
they
had
operated
in
the
past.
it
had
to
protect
consumers
from
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
a
paradoxical
statement
in
and
of
itself.
now,
the
good
faith
negotiation
or
gfn
procedure
was
supposed
to
provide
this
protection,
or
as
mr.
kneedler
just
said,
provide
a
mitigation
of
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
it
cannot
do
that.
by
the
commission's
own
words,
the
gfn
is
one-sided.
they
stated
in
the
rules
that
the
only
time
a
producer
would
ever
invoke
the
gfn
process
is
when
it
had
weighed
the
risks
and
benefits
of
doing
so,
and
after
such
cautious
review,
and
that
was
their
word,
determined
that
they
stood
to
gain
more
than
they
could
lose
by
getting
into
this
process.
and
furthermore,
the
gfn
process
is,
one,
it
is
just,
it
is
not
in
anyway
capable
of
assuring
that
a
gas
supply
that
is
actually
needed
by
the
consuming
public
will
remain
there.
remember,
the
gas
we
are
talking
about
had
been
purchased
and
sold
under
contracts,
some
of
which
had
been
in
place
for
40
and
50
years,
and
provided
the
bedrock
of
service
to
the
general
public.
now
the
producer
was
going
to
decide
if
that
gas
should
even
continue
to
come
to
the
market
at
all.
and
let
me
turn
specifically
to
the
abandonment
procedures
that
are
authorized
here.
they
are
absolutely
contrary
to
section
7(b),
the
prior
holdings
of
this
court,
and
they
cannot
be
squared
with
the
actions
the
commission
took
in
the
felmont
case
or
the
kp&l
case.
first
of
all,
justice
o'connor,
you
asked
mr.
kneedler
if
it
were
true
that
there
is
a
complaint
procedure
available.
nowhere
in
the
rule
making
did
the
commission
ever
mention
that
complaint
procedure.
the
first
time
we
heard
about
it
was
when
we
received
their
brief
in
this
case.
and
all
they
have
stated
on
brief
is
that
we
can
file
such
a
complaint
with
them
if
we
prove
that
the
producer
did
not
comply
with
the
good
faith
negotiation
procedure.
that
is
precisely
our
concern,
that
the
producer
will
comply
with
the
good
faith
negotiation
procedure.
that
he
will
invoke
it
when
he
determines
that
there
is
a
net
benefit
to
him.
and
if
he
doesn't
like
the
price
we
offer,
including
even
a
market
price,
he
will
simply
cancel
the
contract
and
walk
away.
that
result
is
the
very
thing
this
court
found
in
united
gas
pipeline
v.
mccombs
is
unlawful.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
under
present
conditions
that
is
likely
to
happen.
but,
as
the
commission
itself
stated,
no
one
knows
what
the
future
holds.
and
as
these
contracts
disappear
we
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
do
that.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
well,
that
would
be
a
truism,
but
for,
in
this
case,
order
451.
you
cannot
necessarily
buy
it
at
the
market
price.
precisely
when
a
pipeline
has
the
greatest
need
to
keep
gas
under
contract
to
meet
its
service
requirements,
it
must
pay
the
ceiling
price
or
bear
the
risk
of
losing
the
gas.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
in
many
cases
they
are
able
to
make
a
substitute
because
the
market
does
provide
that
opportunity.
but
remember,
the
reason
the
ngpa
was
adopted
was
because
of
severe
shortages
of
supply.
the
market
has
tended
to
go
up
and
down.
those
supplies
may
not
always
be
available.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
well,
the
further
point
is
in
fact
that
that
is
what
congress
specifically
intended
as
to
new
and
hard-to-produce
gas
by
virtue
of
section--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--the
ability
to
go
out
and
shop
in
the
market
for
gas
supplies.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
but
in
the
ngpa,
what
congress
said
is
the
pipelines
should
make
that
kind
of
a
shopping
excursion
as
to
new
gas
and
hard-to-produce
gas.
section
601
of
the
ngpa
expressly
removed
the
commission's
authority
to
regulate
sales
and
abandonments
of
new
or
hard-to-produce
gas.
but
in
direct
contrast,
congress
retained
the
commission's
regulatory
control
over
old
gas.
it
did
not
want
the
market
to
be
the
protector
of
consumer
interests
as
to
that
gas.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
in
this
case
in
fact
the
commission
alleges
that
it
has
regulated
in
some
sense
the
abandonment
of
old
gas.
but
when
you
look
at
this
rule
there
is
no
regulatory
presence
at
all.
if
and
when
any
abandonment
occurs
is
solely
at
the
discretion
of
the
producer.
and
in
the...
there
are
really
two
what
i
might
call
generations
of
abandonments
involved.
one
is
the
first
set
of
abandonments
that
occurs
under
the
gfn
process.
both
the
commission
and
the
producers
seek
to
defend
only
that
abandonment.
they
claim
the
procedures
they
have
adopted
fully
met
with
the
procedural
requirements
of
section
7(b).
but
there
is
an
entirely
different
set
of
abandonments
at
issue
here.
once
the
contract
expires
from
the
renegotiation
under
the
gfn,
then
the
producer
is
free
to
do
anything
that
it
wants
with
that
gas
until
the
reserves
are
depleted.
any
future
abandonments
that
it
may
have
required,
absent
the
commission's
action
in
this
proceeding,
are
now
removed.
the
commission
has
granted
a
blanket
certificate
and
a
blanket
abandonment
to
authorize
all
future
sales
and
abandonments
of
old
gas.
now
what
that
means,
bluntly,
is
that
private
parties
and
the
contracts
they
enter
into
now
control
the
entire
process
of
how
old
gas
reaches
the
market.
this
court
held,
in
mccombs,
in
the
sunray
case,
and
in
the
southwind
case,
that
private
contracts,
expiration
of
leases,
and
the
private
conduct
of
a
party
cannot
meet
the
clear
and
express
demands
of
section
7(b),
which
required
commission
intervention.
moreover,
even
as
to
the
first
generation
of
abandonments
here,
there
is
no
opportunity
for
an
interested
party
to
take
part
in
the
abandonment
process.
there
is
no
notice
to
the
commission
that
a
producer
has
invoked
the
gfn
process
against
a
particular
pipeline.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
well,
that
is
our
whole
concern,
because
the
commission
has
said
if
you
don't
say
a,
b,
or
c,
don't
even
bother
coming
to
us.
we
don't
want
to
know
about
the
hard
impact
it
may
have
on
consumers.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
the
commission--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--but
it
has
to,
it
has
to
provide
some
regulatory
presence
for
itself.
you
know,
at
the
time
they
approved
these
particular
procedures,
the
gfn
process
was
not
yet
even
in
effect.
they
could
not
know
at
that
point
what
abandonments
might
or
might
not
occur
in
the
future.
they
could
be
occurring
right
now
and
they
know
nothing
about
it.
the
bottom
line
is,
they
have
chosen,
as
a
form
of
"regulation"
to
simply
absent
themselves
from
the
whole
process.
and
the
extent
to
which
they
have
absented
themselves
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
producer
file
with
them,
provide
an
opportunity
for,
say,
a
local
distribution
company
served
by
a
pipeline
to
come
in
and
show
that
this
gas
is
necessary
to
meet
its
market
requirements,
which
are
even
more
closely
tied
to
the
consumer.
there
is
no
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
private-party
interests
are
not
in
some
way
impairing
consumer
interests
under
this
rule.
now,
the
bottom
line
is
that
when
you
read
the
order
as
a
whole,
this
was
exactly
the
result
that
the
commission
intended.
it
set
a
ceiling
price
that
it
says
it
doesn't
want
to
be
collected.
it
wants
the
market
to
set
the
rate.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
yes,
there
are.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
exactly.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
that,
of
course,
was
a
problem
as
to
these
high-cost
contracts
that
were
contributing
to
the
take
or
pay
problem.
up
until
the
commission's
action
in
this
proceeding
it
had
never
been
a
problem,
because
quite
frankly
the
commission
had
never
provided
such
an
unprecedented
increase
in
the
price
of
old
gas.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
under
the
contract
as
it
stood,
that
is
true.
but,
you
see,
the
difference
is
in
order
23,
which
was
issued--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--in
some
instances
that
might
be
true,
but
where
you--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--well,
when
you...
for
example,--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--but
you
can't
always
buy
the
volume
that
you
need
or
when
you
need
it,
and
so
the
problem
is
that
we
have--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--there
have
been
instances
when
respondents
have
had
to
stick
to
the
contract
because
they
needed
the
gas
supply.
now
you
see,
the
interesting
thing
is
is
that
the
commission
keeps
talking
about
the
fact
that
automatic
collection
is
a
bad
thing
because
it
causes
market
distortions
that
are
just
as
unjust
and
unreasonable,
they
say,
as
the
old
vintage
structure
did.
but
the
bottom
line
is,
the
only
way
you
have
any
assurance
of
keeping
this
gas
under
contract
is
to
pay
a
price
that
they
say
should
not
be
collected.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
that
was
their
statement,
but
any
kind
of
a
hard
look
at
that
indicates
it
cannot
be.
we
offered
a
number
of
changes
to
that
procedure--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--and
had
there
not
been
that
process,
the
commission
would
have
taken
an
action
that
it
itself
conceded
was
unlawful.
it
defined
the--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--the
commission
defined--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--the
commission
stated
that
the
gfn
process
is
an
integral
component
of
the
rate
itself.
it
is
essential
to
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
this
rate.
therefore,
while
they
now
claim
that
it
was
put
in
for
our
protection,
and
they
certainly
hoped
that
it
would
operate
that
way,
they
knew
they
had
to
have
that
rate
there,
that
condition
and
procedure
there
to
make
the
rate
they
set
just
and
reasonable.
they
have
never
done
anything
like
this
before,
because
they
had
never
provided
this
type
of
a
price
increase
for
old
gas.
the
interesting
thing
is
that
what
they
did
here
is
they
wiped
out
in
one
fell
swoop
not
only
all
vintage
prices
for
old
gas,
but
one-half
of
the
pricing
categories
that
congress
established
on
the
face
of
the
ngpa
itself.
they
did
so
for
the
express
purpose,
they
said,
of
delaying
production
of
new
gas.
and
yet
any
reasonable
reading
of
the
ngpa
indicates
that
congress
wanted
just
the
opposite.
they
wanted
to
produce
that
new
gas,
and
they
withheld
incentives
from
old
gas.
then,
when
you
look
at
the
operation
of
the
procedure
established,
there
is
no
fundamental
difference
in
how
this
rule
operates
and
the
way
the
department
of
justice
proposal
would
have
operated
that
they
proposed.
it
allows,
if
it
goes
according
to
plan,
for
the
market
to
set
rates.
congress
expressly
refused
to
let
the
market
set
rates
for
old
gas.
it
did
not
include
old
gas
in
section
121,
which
is
the
deregulatory
provision.
and
then,
only
2
months
before
the
commission
initiated
this
rule
making,
it
stated
in
its
block
billing
rule
making
proposal
that
old
gas
is
not
market-responsive
specifically
by
legislative
intent.
and
that
legislative
intent
was
that
the
price
incentives
be
focused
on
new
and
hard-to-produce
gas.
and
then
2
months
later
it
suddenly
found
that
old
gas
should
be
priced
at
the
market,
and
it
offered
no
reason
whatsoever
why
its
statement
60
days
before
was
wrong.
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
end
result
of
the
action
taken
just
on
the
pricing
mechanism
is
that
old
gas
is
now
priced
much
higher
than
the
average
price
of
new
and
hard-to-produce
gas
that
has
been
deregulated.
that
result
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
what
congress
intended.
it
said
the
market,
upon
deregulation,
should
provide
the
maximum
incentive.
well,
the
commission
has
provided
a
much
greater
incentive
for
old
gas,
as
is
shown
in
appendix
c
to
our
brief.
the
price
of
old
gas
is
now
substantially
higher
than
the
price
of
new
gas.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
the
ceil...
the
price
of...
the
average
wellhead
price
paid
for
old
gas
is
now
higher
than
the
average
price
of
all
other
wellhead
gas,
including
new
gas
that
has
been
deregulated.
that
can't
be
squared
with
what
congress
intended
in
this
statute.
every
aspect
of
this
order,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
was
designed
for
one
reason.
the
commission
decided
it
just
wasn't
wise
any
more
for
them
to
exert
any
kind
of
a
regulatory
presence
over
old
gas.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
um
hum.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
congress
deregulated
new
gas.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
in
many
cases
it
is.
the
only
problem
is
that--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--because,
in
fact,
its
price
has
gone
up
under
this
rule
in
some
instances.
the
average
price
paid--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--the
procedure--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--the
procedure
apparently
isn't
working
in
all
respects
as
they
anticipated.
you
see,
that's...
the
best
that
could
be
hoped
for
here,
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
if
this
rule
operated
as
intended
would
be
that
the
price
of
old
gas
would
actually
be
deregulated.
but
there
was
something
worse
here.
if
you
needed
the
gas,
the
only
way
you
could
keep
it
was
to
actually
pay
the
ceiling
price,
and
then
you
were
paying,
as
the
current
circumstances
are,
twice
what
the
market
allowed.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
um
hum.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
that
is
true.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
no,
no,
congress
never
said
that
the
commission
could
deregulate
old
gas,
and
the
commission
in
order
451
specifically
said
it
could
not.
congress
left
a
piece
of
the
commission's
just
and
reasonable
rate
making
authority
changed
in
a
very
significant
respect.
they
can
only
raise
the
price.
now,
that
fits
precisely
with
the
prior
definitions
the
commission
had
given
of
how
that
should
be
interpreted.
it
was
a
special
relief
mechanism.
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
well,--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--actually,
the
commission--
ms.
roberta
lee
halladay
--i
just
want
to
follow
a
scheme
that
congress
proposed.
the
commission
here
said
it
wanted
to
put
more
gas
on
the
market,
with
the
hope
that
that
would
cause
other
prices
to
come
down
in
problem
take
or
pay
contracts,
and
it
didn't
even
work
on
that
point.
the
bottom
line
is
congress
had
a
very
clear
pricing
scheme--
