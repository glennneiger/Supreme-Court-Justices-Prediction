justice
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
my
i
ask
you
about
the
abandonment
question--
justice
o'connor
--that
we
have
in
front
of
us.
is
it
possible
that
an
individual
plaintiff
could
come
in
and
challenge
an
abandonment
and
assert
specific
grounds
and
get
a
hearing?
do
we
know
whether
that
is
possible?
justice
o'connor
it
wasn't
clear
to
me
from
your
brief
whether
that
is
the
position
that
ferc
was
taking.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
ms.
halladay,
the
statute
says
that
ferc
can
raise
the
price
ceiling
on
any
gas,
so
long
as
it
is
just
and
reasonable.
it
doesn't
talk
about
maintaining
vintage
pricing.
and
ferc
has
interpreted
its
powers
as
allowing
this
particular
order.
isn't
that
the
end
of
it
as
far
as
we
are
concerned?
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
commission
can
change
its
mind
and
its
approach,
so
long
as
it's
within
its
statutory
authority.
