mr.
roger
g.
connor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
courts,
the
issue
in
this
case
stated
very
simply
is
whether
in
a
mann
act
prosecution,
where
the
wife
is
the
person
transported
contrary
to
law,
the
government
may
compel
that
wife
to
testify
at
the
trial
over
the
objection
of
the
wife
when
she
is
called
as
a
witness.
the
petitioner
claims
that
in
this
case
two
special
factors
operate
to
prohibit
the
educing
of
this
kind
of
testimony
by
the
government.
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
they
were
married
after
the
commission
of
the
offense.
apparently,
this
indicates
some
notion
that
these
two
people
are
happy
together,
they
have
a
marriage
relationship,
which
should
not
be
invaded
by
the
--
the
law
in
its
efforts
to
seek
out
the
truth
at
trials.
the
second
point,
it
seems
quite
clear
from
the
petitioners'
argument
and
brief
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
we
would
agree
over
that.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
we
would
agree
with
that
statement
your
honor.
it's
simply
that
i
believe
that
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
demonstrate
that
this
relationship
in
issue,
in
case
of
bar,
is
one
of
those
which
comes
within
the
policy
of
the
privileged.
and
that
they
were
married
after
the
offense
and
there
is
a
marital
relationship
which
is
entitled
to
protection
like
any
other.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
of
course
that
goes
into
the
question
of
whether
the
privilege
is
desirable,
but
we
feel
that
that
was
settled
in
hawkins
against
united
states
last
term,
in
which
this
court
examined
the
bases
of
that
rule
and
determined
that
the
rule
should
still
be
enforced
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
frankly,
in
the
government's
view
it
makes
no
difference,
it
does
not.
that
is
wigmore
and
the
other
authorities
on
evidence
indicate
that
ordinarily
the
marital
privilege,
if
it
obtains,
is
conferred
in
a
situation
like
this
as
much
as
in
the
situation
where
they
were
married
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
wigmore
says
that
even
if
he
marries
the
woman
after
she
has
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
as
a
witness
at
trial,
it
would
be
valid
to
raise
the
--
the
privilege.
the
theory
being
that
the
privilege
is
to
protect
the
husband
and
wife
relationship.
this
operates
conversely
from
the
marital
communication
privilege
in
which
the
--
the
communication
was
before
marriage
that
the
marriage
is
not
privileged
and
after
divorce
the
privilege
still
holds
good
for
those
communications
that
were
made
during
marriage.
wigmore
says
that
this
operates
the
other
way.
we
are
willing
to
concede
that
too
that
that
would
be
the
ordinary
operation
of
the
rule.
but
we
claim
that
in
this
case
the
privilege
doesn't
attach
whatever
and
into
it
does
not
attach,
there
is
nothing
privileged
here
to
protect,
she
is
compellable
as
any
other
witness
would
be.
petitioner
makes
a
great
deal
out
of
the
privilege
as
being
some
kind
of
a
fundamental
basic
legal
right
which
is
entitled
to
protection
and
which
is
entitled
to
extension
to
almost
remote
analogies,
but
we
feel
that
the
more
fundamental
principle
is
that
a
testimonial
duty
which
rests
on
every
citizen
to
give
testimony
in
court.
this
is
something
which
is
at
least
as
old
and
honorable
as
any
marital
privilege
because
it
goes
back
to
the
early
english
subpoena
powers
of
chancery
and
to
the
statute
of
elizabeth
compelling
testimony
in
courts
of
law
in
england.
the
--
the
analysis
of
the
government
is
basically
that
the
privilege
itself
is
an
intrusion
on
what
would
be
the
ordinary
rule
of
law.
it
makes
no
difference
from
the
standpoint
of
analysis,
whether
we
say
that
the
exception
as
to
offenses
against
the
wife
is
an
exception
to
a
privileged
rule
or
whether
we
say
that
the
rule
simply
doesn't
cover
it.
in
our
way
of
thinking,
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
in
the
hawkins
case
last
term,
the
government
did
propose
a
rule
whereby
voluntary
testimony
by
spouses
would
always
be
allowed
and
compelled
testimony
would
never
be
allowed.
this
court
rejected
that
rule.
we
are
here
today
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
rule
it
stated
in
hawkins.
in
hawkins,
the
court
noted
that
there
is
this
exception.
it
also
noted
that
there
was
no
known
distinction
in
the
previous
cases
on
which
the
court
relied
which
justified
a
distinction
between
voluntary
and
compelled
testimony.
now
again,
that
brings
us
back
to
this
point
that
if
the
privilege
is
not
attached,
then
we
feel
that
there
is
a
duty
which
is
operative
here
and
under
which
the
wife
must
testify.
this
goes
even
deeper
to
the
policies
which
underlie
the
privileges.
we
have
a
basic
public
interest
in
getting
at
the
truth
in
court.
the
ordinary
evidentiary
rules
are
designed
to
get
at
the
truth
and
to
aid
that
process.
they
hearsay
rule,
the
opinion
rule,
and
these
other
rules
ordinarily
ensure
against
the
introduction
of
untrustworthy
or
unreliable
data
to
the
submission
of
the
fact
finder.
a
rule
of
privilege
on
the
other
hand,
operates
as
a
bar
against
getting
at
the
truth,
as
a
shield
against
it.
so
that
the
only
reason
for
which
a
privilege
is
warranted
is
that
we
have
some
other
public
interest
such
as
here
the
marital
relationship
which
requires
protection
even
at
the
expense
of
getting
at
the
truth.
we
claim
that
here
in
this
limited
situation
of
a
mann
act
prosecution,
we
do
not
have
a
pattern
which
requires
the
operation
of
the
marital
privilege.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
for
stealing
together,
in
that
event
that
would
not
be
an
offense
directly
violative
of
the
marital
relationship
nor
degrading
of
the
wife
itself.
as
other
courts
have
noted
that
would
--
that
would
be
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
your
honor
that
would
be
a
question
which
one
could
only
determine
on
the
basis
of
facts
submitted
in
such
a
case,
but
as
a
general
proposition,
if
they
both
voluntarily
committed
the
crime
of
larceny
together,
in
an
indirect
sense,
he
might
be
contributing
to
the
worsening
of
her
morals.
but
here
in
the
mann
act
case,
we
have
a
direct
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
but
the
fact
that
they
commit
larceny
together
is
not
a
thing
which
is
so
directly
violative
of
notions
of
marriage
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
in
a
civilized
society
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
then,
in
that
event,
he
would
be
contributing
to
some
kind
of
moral
delinquency
on
her
part.
but
we
claim
that
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
we
don't
believe
she
could
--
he
could.
in
fact,
there's
a
good
question
of
whether
the
privilege
would
obtain
where
he
committed
larceny
against
her,
stole
something
from
her
or
defrauded
her.
that
is
a
question
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
the
instigator?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
that
leads
us
to
the
second
phase
of
what
the
government's
argument,
which
is
that
in
it
the
mann
act
makes
consent,
not
an
operative
fact
in
the
commission
of
the
offense,
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
import
a
distinction
into
the
law
of
evidence.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
your
honor.
there
may
be
situations
where
she
is
the
primary
instigator
of
the
offense.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
but
we
believe
that
congress
has
laid
down
a
policy
whereby
whether
she
is
a
victim
or
to
what
extent
she
is,
is
rather
immaterial
of
congress
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
your
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
your
--
your
honor
we
feel
that
anytime
that
a
man
transports
his
wife
in
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
that
she
should
engage
in
prostitution,
that
is
the
sale
of
her
body,
that
this
is
an
offense
which
is
violative
of
her
as
a
person
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
your
honor,
i
think
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
had
made
it
clear
that
while
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
legislation
as
the
interstate
commerce
power,
the
purpose
was
to
get
at
commercialized
vice
and
to
prohibit
men
from
transporting
girls
in
commerce
for
these
degrading
purposes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
we
don't
think
that
it's
possible
to
say
that
this
is
strictly
an
offense
against
the
public
or
strictly
in
offense
against
the
wife.
it's
both,
it
partakes
of
both
like
many
offenses
do.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
follow
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think
the
use
of
the
term
vic
--
“victim”
is
unfortunate.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think
it's
more
the
idea
that
society
will
not
continence
certain
kinds
of
crimes
committed
against
wives.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
sir,
in
our
brief
we
note
that
the
purpose
of
the
act,
however,
was
to
put
a
clamp
down
on
--
on
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
commerce
and
vice
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
--
that
is
correct.
but
we
are
not
positing
this
case
on
the
notion
that
the
wife
is
a
victim
in
each
instance,
rather
we
are
positing
it
on
the
public
policy
which
underlies
this
exception.
the
courts
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no.
necessity
to
either
convict
people
of
a
crime
or
to
vindicate
the
wife's
interests
is
the
rationale
offered
by
petitioner.
we
disagree
thoroughly
with
this.
we
believe
that
the
true
purpose
of
the
exception
is
this
that
when
a
man
commits
an
offense
which
is
directly
violative
of
the
marital
relationship,
such
as
assaulting
her,
or
in
this
case,
prostituting
her
or
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
or
contributing
to
--
to
her
prostitution
that
in
such
an
event
the
law
will
not
allow
him
to
use
this
privilege
as
a
shield,
because
this
is
not
within
the
purpose
of
the
privilege,
it's
--
it
was
originally
conceived.
and
we
have
cases
which
support
this
position
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
we
have
no
cases
in
the
federal
or
state
courts
which
seemed
to
clearly
bear
on
the
situation
here.
it
is
a
case
--
a
case
of
first
impression.
but
the
rationale
is
the
same.
the
english
case
cited
in
our
brief
rex
against
lapworth
in
1931
was
one
where
there
was
an
assault
against
the
wife,
she
did
not
wish
to
testify
against
her
husband
in
court,
and
the
king's
bench
in
england
held
that
that
didn't
matter
because
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
they
held
that
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
an
aggravated
assault.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
on
that
question,
the
legislative
record
appears
to
be
blank.
however,
the
fact
that
they
inserted
it
in
the
cases
involving
aliens
to
our
way
of
thinking
does
not
preclude
also
applying
the
exception
in
this
kind
of
case.
i
don't
believe
that
congress
consciously
thought
about
the
exception
when
it
passed
the
mann
act.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
as
i
say
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
do
not
know
the
reason
for
the
omission
of
that
in
the
act.
that
is
of
course
the
problem
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
that
courts
have
had
to
consider.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
one
reason
for
that
your
honor
is
the
fact
that
all
of
the
lower
federal
courts,
with
the
exception
of
one,
the
opinion
of
which
is
now
been
disapproved,
have
uniformly
held
that
the
wife
may
testify
against
the
husband
in
a
mann
act
prosecution
and
all
of
those
cases
of
course
involved
voluntary
testimony.
now,
for
that
reason
the
government
has
never
considered
it
necessary
to
submit
a
proposed
amendment
to
congress.
all
the
courts
below
is
pretty
well
come
to
conclusion
that
this
is
the
kind
of
an
offense
which
brings
it
within
the
exception
both
on
general
collective
policy
grounds
and
also
because
of
the
degradation
which
is
in
fact
practiced
on
the
wife.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
court
below.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
we
don't
see
it
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
your
--
your
honor.
we
--
we
feel
that
this
would
be
irrational
application
of
the
existing
exception
of
the
rule.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
your
--
your
honor.
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
say
that
we
do
not
feel
that
the
privilege
itself
covers
this
situation.
we
do
not
think
it's
important
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
whether
we
talk
in
terms
of
an
exception
or
not.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
the
expression
usually
is
except
where
he
has
committed
an
offense
against
the
wife.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
we
do
your
honor
because
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
we
feel
that
it's
such
a
bad
thing
for
the
husband
to
do
to
the
wife
that
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
from
--
from
the
wife
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no.
we
--
we
feel
that
that's
in
a
different
category.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
and
different
in
kind
too.
a
man
who
transports
his
wife
for
the
purposes
of
prostitution
is
degrading
the
marital
relationship,
making
a
mockery
of
it,
and
he's
making
it
necessary
or
at
least
possible
for
her
to
be
continuously
assaulted
by
various
men
in
the
sense
of
adding
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
in
the
sense
of
having
intercourse
which
is
prohibited
under
ordinary
notions
of
a
civilized
marriage
relationship.
we
feel
the
whole
thing
is
--
is
highly
inconsistent
with
marriage
as
we
know
it.
it's
therefore,
the
kind
of
an
offense
against
the
wife.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
as
the
courts
below
had
so
often
said,
it
is
the
kind
of
an
offense
which
is
so
at
warrant
to
a
marital
relationship
that
it
--
it
comes
within
the
exception
just
as
much
as
assaults
against
the
wife.
in
fact,
in
many
cases,
wife
beating
is
something
which
could
be
more
likely
condoned
than
--
than
an
offense
which
leads
toward
her
prostitution,
the
use
of
her
body
for
game.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
on
that
question,
we
feel
that
the
expression
by
congress
in
the
mann
act
whereby
the
consent
of
the
woman
is
not
an
element
of
the
case
indicates
a
congressional
policy
which
should
be
given
effect
by
this
court.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
her
evidence
was
necessary
perhaps
conviction
could
have
been
obtained
without
it,
but
it
would
be
dubious
at
this,
though
her
evidence,
we
are
willing
to
concede
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
was
necessary.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
should
think
that
otherwise
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
have
no
information
on
the
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
have
no
information
on
the
number
of
cases
in
which
she
is
either
necessary
or
support
--
support
as
witness.
i
--
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
--
the
mann
act
policy
does
come
in
play
here
in
that
the
privilege
itself
and
the
exception
both
rests
on
public
policy.
and
that
if
this
court
does
say
that
this
kind
of
testimony
comes
within
the
exception,
it
will
be
carrying
out
the
congressional
purpose,
whereas
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
say
that
whoever
person
marries
after
the
commission
of
the
offense,
a
privilege
against
the
wife's
testimony
is
raised,
that
congressional
purpose
will
be
frustrated.
and
as
it
was
settled
a
little
while
ago,
it
would
amount
in
many
cases
to
an
invitation
to
evade
the
law
and
to
evade
it
in
a
situation
where
a
man
has
committed
offense
which
is
degrading
against
the
wife.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
your
honor
in
the
case
that
you
proposed
involving
narcotics,
i
do
not
know
what
position
we
would
take,
but
i'm
sure
that
this
is
an
entirely
different
situation
from
the
one
at
bar.
here,
we
have
the
--
the
congressional
act
prohibiting
this
kind
of
transportation.
it's
well
acknowledged
that
this
is
degrading
to
wives
whether
it's
with
their
consent
or
without.
the
narcotics
law
is
a
different
thing
entirely.
this
case
doesn't
ask
the
court
to
construe
generally
the
scope
of
the
exception.
there
are
all
sorts
of
questions
as
to
what
kinds
of
an
--
of
an
offense
would
be
included
within
this
exception.
we
do
not
feel
that's
an
issue
here
and
we
feel
that
the
policy
of
the
mann
act
comes
into
play
in
this
case
in
a
way
which
would
not
be
present
in
other
situations,
such
as
where
a
husband
might
defraud
a
wife
or
where
he
might
do
other
things
which
are
injurious
to
the
marriage
but
nevertheless
are
not
so
directly
harmful
to
the
wife's
morals
as
this
kind
of
case.
in
lord
audley's
case,
the
old
english
basis
for
this
in
which
the
wife
was
allowed
to
testify
to
a
rape,
where
the
husband
had
instigated
his
servants
to
commit
rape
upon
his
wife,
the
court
admitted
it.
in
this
kind
of
case,
the
husband
is
instigating
an
immorality
committed
against
the
wife
in
the
same
spirit
and
as
one
court
below
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
pointed
out.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
but
it
was
instigated
by
the
husband
and
the
court
there
held
that
where
the
husband
does
that
kind
of
thing,
the
privilege
shall
not
attach.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think
the
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
think
that
the
theory
of
the
mann
act
is
that
some
of
these
women
may
well
be
consenting
parties
but
that
they
may
be
so
degraded
that
they
don't
necessarily
appreciate
what's
good
for
them.
we
want
to
put
it
in
plain
terms
and
that
the
law
will
protect
them
without
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
their
--
their
desire
to
be
protected.
i
think
that's
implicit
in
the
mann
act
also
in
the
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
they
did.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
we
do
not
know.
at
least
the
government
does
not
know.
the
government
doesn't
feel
that
it's
controlling
in
any
way,
because
what
congress
might
have
thought
on
the
subject
is
something
which
shouldn't
necessarily
control
the
interpretation
of
the
mann
act.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
congress,
in
outlining
the
substance
of
offense,
may
consent
immaterial.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
and
that
if
the
procedural
law
is
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
substance,
then
in
the
procedural
area
where
this
privilege
is
in
question,
we
should
give
effect
to
that
congressional
purpose
in
determining
what
the
limits
of
the
exception
are.
that
is
the
core
of
our
argument.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
your
honor
i
have
not.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
in
this
case
yes.
if
this
course
--
in
this
court
reverses
the
determination
of
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
it
will
be,
in
our
view,
overruling
all
of
the
federal
cases
decided
on
the
point
of
whether
the
privilege
attaches.
however
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
under
the
mann
act.
there's
a
line
of
federal
decisions
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
they've
held
that
where
a
wife
wants
to
testify
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
she
may.
we
claim
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
voluntary
or
compelled
because
it's
a
question
of
the
privilege
in
itself.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
we
hold
--
we
feel
that
these
privileges
are
controlled
by
policies
which
underlie
them
and
that's
why
the
courts
below
have
determined
that
it's
not
privileged.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
only
one
your
honor,
shores
against
the
united
states.
petitioner
claims
that
it
is
dictum,
we
will
not
dispute
that,
the
wife
i
believe
there
said
that
she
didn't
care
to
testify
but
she
didn't
clearly
invoke
a
privilege.
now,
the
government
is
not
urging
with
that
case
--
that
--
that
statement
is
ratio
decidendi
of
the
case
by
any
means.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct
and
--
and
to
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
apply
the
previously
existing
rule.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
i
--
i
did
not
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no.
i
--
i
believe
i
said
that
if
this
case
was
reversed
by
this
court
that
in
that
event,
we
would
be
overruling
a
line
of
federal
cases.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
quite
a
few.
in
our
brief
we
cite
--
we
cite
nine
or
ten
of
them
at
page
12
of
our
brief.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
we
have
the
second,
fifth,
eighth,
ninth
circuits
and
the
tenth.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
was
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
united
states
against
gwen.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no.
and
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
and
at
a
later
time,
the
court
of
appeals,
as
we
recall,
disapproved
that
case.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
no,
no
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
it
did
not.
there
--
there
was
another
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
which
was
disapproved
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
later.
but
the
case
of
u.s.
against
gwen
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
contrary
to
our
position
and
that's
that.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
your
honor.
it
was
a
rather
ample
opinion
and
i
believe
judge
clark
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
judge
clark
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes
your
honor.
in
reply
to
the
matter
raised
by
the
petitioner,
we
have
lutwak
against
united
states
cited
in
our
brief,
but
not
for
any
bearing
that
it
might
have
on
the
--
the
question
of
privilege.
there,
the
only
question
was
whether
you
could
destroy
a
sham
marriage
in
court
by
showing
that
it
was
a
sham
whether
the
privilege
there
would
prohibit
the
government
in
doing
so.
we
cited
lutwak
in
here,
because
lutwak
discusses
the
--
the
framing
of
evidentiary
rules
by
this
court
in
the
light
of
the
common
law
and
reason
and
experienced
under
rule
26
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
it
was
put
in
there
for
that
reason.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
--
i
think
perhaps
your
honor
it
--
it
is
permissible
to
talk
about
a
privilege,
that
is,
originally
the
rule
was
founded
at
incompetency
in
that
the
wife
and
husband
were
considered
to
be
one
and
until
funk
against
united
states
in
this
court
in
1933,
they
were
considered
to
be
incompetent.
but
on
an
analytical
basis,
we
think
that
this
is
a
privilege.
it's
a
privilege
which
can
be
invoked
by
either
husband
or
wife
if
it
applies.
we
just
say
it
doesn't
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
if
--
if
that
were
true
your
honor,
then
the
privilege
could
not
be
waived
and
yet
previous
decisions
of
this
court
hold
that
if
both
the
husband
and
wife
were
willing
to
have
her
testify
that
she
may.
if
that's
true,
we
don't
believe
that
analytically
speaking
this
can
be
called
a
--
a
competency
question.
it's
rather
a
question
of
privilege,
just
like
the
self-incrimination
privilege
which
may
be
waived
like
the
attorney
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
client
privilege.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
can
discover
from
reading
those
cases,
they
speak
very
little
of
a
victim.
they
speak
more
in
terms
of
this
being
the
kind
of
an
offense
which
does
not
come
within
the
exception
because
the
offense
is
violated
with
the
marital
relationship.
and
they
speak
more
in
those
terms
as
i
read
those
cases.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
authorities
of
--
of
this
court
on
that
question
except
the
general
ones,
construing
the
mann
act
and
saying
that
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
strike
was
commercialized
vice
even
though
the
constitutional
basis
for
its
enactment
is
the
commerce
power.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
they
go
on
that
rationale.
they
also,
in
those
lower
courts
--
lower
federal
court
cases,
utilized
decisions
of
state
courts
and
the
english
courts
which
deal
with
this
privilege
and
the
exception
to
it.
we
are
urging
this
court
to
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
most
of
the
statutes
are
declaratory
to
the
common
law
in
this
respect,
and
stated
in
those
terms,
the
courts
there
presented
with
virtually
the
same
question
that
this
court
is.
petitioner
cited
a
line
of
statutory
rape
cases
and
also
in
a
case
which
involves
a
husband
procuring
an
abortion
for
his
wife.
the
state
courts
and
many
of
those
instances
have
said
that
where
the
wife
does
not
want
to
testify
then
against
the
husband,
that
it
comes
within
the
privilege
and
not
the
exception.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
cited
the
line
of
cases
in
our
brief
where
--
where
the
husband
has
committed
assaults
against
the
wife
and
the
courts
have
there
held
that
it
does
come
within
the
exception.
and
the
english
court
noted
that
if
she's
not
within
the
exception,
then
she's
compellable
like
any
other
witness.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
--
i
believe
in
one
of
them,
they
are
mentioned
but
rejected.
most
of
them
don't
--
don't
seem
to
dwell
on
to
any
extent.
the
holdings
of
these
courts
below
were
all
tied
to
the
mann
act
and
the
purposes
of
it,
and
we
believe
that
the
adoption
of
this
by
the
court
in
this
case
will
result
in
effectuating
the
purposes
of
the
mann
act,
that
that
will
be
the
pragmatic
effect
and
that
the
overturning
of
this
line
of
doctrine
in
the
courts
below
will
result
in
a
frustration
of
the
purposes
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
mann
act.
we're
not
asking
for
the
extension
of
something
which
is
deleterious
to
the
marital
privilege.
we
are
asking
that
the
privilege
be
enforced
in
its
proper
spirit,
that
that
is
exception
to
the
privilege
not
be
allowed
in
this
kind
of
case,
because
the
--
allowing
the
exception
here
would
not
be
consonant
with
the
purposes
of
congress
in
the
mann
act
nor
even
with
the
public
policies
that
underlie
the
privilege.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
in
what
respect
your
honor?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
that
is
the
rationale
of
the
exception.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
believe
that
some
courts
have
held
it
to
be.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
but
in
this
case,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
construe
the
precise
scope
of
the
exception
in
all
of
its
possible
applications.
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
application
of
it
to
a
mann
act
case.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
not
necessarily.
that
would
remain
for
determination
in
particular
cases
as
they
arose.
and
it's
important
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
so
far
there
has
been
no
great
extension
of
this
principle
to
other
than
the
mann
act
cases
and
the
courts
below.
none
that
is
apparent
from
the
research
which
we've
done.
some
courts,
i
believe,
have
held
that
defrauding
of
the
wife
comes
within
the
exception.
others
perhaps
have
held
not.
there
are
many
other
close
cases
such
as
where
the
husband
commits
a
sexual
offense
against
the
child
of
the
parties
or
against
the
stepchild
or
something
like
that.
again,
we
have
something
rather
violative
of
the
marital
relationship
but
many
courts
would
say
that
it
is
not
directly
enough
involved
and
would
still
say
that
the
privilege
applied.
we're
saying
that
here
in
the
mann
act
case,
we
have
a
different
situation,
because
in
addition
to
the
rationale
of
the
rules,
we
have
the
policy
of
congress
coming
into
play,
that
the
consent
of
the
woman
is
immaterial
in
the
commission
of
the
offense,
and
that
making
the
evidentiary
rule
accord
with
that
will
best
effectuate
that
congressional
purpose.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
beyond
what
your
honor?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
they
have.
they
have
your
honor.
that,
in
brief,
is
our
argument
unless
the
court
has
other
questions,
i
will
conclude
now.
thank
you.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
dictum.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
what
is
that?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
just
what?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
right.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
has
there
been
any
case
in
which
the
court
has
over
him
if
you
know
one?
