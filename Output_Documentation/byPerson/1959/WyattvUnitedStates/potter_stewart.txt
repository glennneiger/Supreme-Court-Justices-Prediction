justice
potter
stewart
it
also
appears
to
be
in
the
defendant,
petitioner
there
at
one
stage
again
told
an
fbi
agent
that
he
was
married
at
the
time
of
transportation.
justice
potter
stewart
married
to
this
woman,
this
witness?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
below
in
fact
said
it
didn't
make
any
difference
when
they
--
whether
they
are
married
at
the
time
of
transportation
or
were
subsequently
married
or
not
married
at
all,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
it's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
would
be
terribly
contrary
to
public
policy
to
have
marital
discord
develop
from
a
situation
where
a
man
was
transporting
his
own
wife
in
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
social
policy
which
should
induce
this
court
to
preserve
that
kind
of
a
marriage?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn't
that
also
be
true
where
there
--
where
there
was
no
sanctity
or
tranquility?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
by
hypothesis
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
that's
--
that's
--
it's
hardly
true,
is
it?
you're
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
two
things,
that
if
--
if
these
--
if
the
petitioner
here
and
this
witness
were
married
at
the
time
of
the
transportation
or
the
alleged
federal
offense,
you
concede,
as
i
understand
if
and
at
least
argue
and
though
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
this
would
come
within
the
exception
recognized
in
the
hawkins
opinion
that
when
the
wife
is
the
victim,
she
is
a
competent
witness.
but
you
say,
if
they
were
unmarried
at
the
time
of
the
transportation
and
subsequently
married,
married
before
the
trial,
then
she
is
an
incompetent
witness.
is
that
--
and
you
say
that
this
is
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
doesn't
this
just
if
--
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
any
such
rule
that
--
wouldn't
that
serve
notice
on
every
violator
of
the
mann
act
in
the
united
states
that
the
way
to
escape
prosecution
is
simply
to
marry
the
woman
before
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
the
government
simply
telling
us
that
the
--
there's
always
been
an
exception
to
this
rule
when
the
wife
is
the
victim
of
the
offense,
and
telling
us
further
that
so
far
in
the
federal
courts
the
courts
have
considered
that
a
mann
act
violation
comes
within
this
exception.
it's
you,
isn't
it,
who's
asking
us
to
change
the
rule.
a
rule
to
be
sure
never
established
and
under
considered
in
this
court,
but
a
rule
generally
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
hawkins
case
held,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
your
position
that
you're
not
asking
us
to
change
a
rule
but
rather
--
rather
to
follow
the
rule
of
the
federal
court.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
circuits?
justice
potter
stewart
now
isn't
it
true
that
there
was
no
reason
for
the
government
to
feel
itself
hampered
because
with
one
district
court
exception,
every
one
of
the
federal
courts
has
permitted
the
wife
to
testify.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
we
would
have
to
overrule
the
hawkins
case
in
order
to
make
a
distinction
between
permission
and
compulsion
for
the
testimony
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
does.
the
whole
certiorari
was
granted
on
the
basis
that
this
had
something
to
do
with
her
being
a
wife.
justice
potter
stewart
surely
not
you're
--
you're
not
telling
us
that
this
was
not
a
violation
of
the
mann
act
if
--
if
this
transportation
did
take
place,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
think
it
makes
a
difference
or
it
might
make
a
difference
that
was
before
or
after
the
offense,
don't
you?
