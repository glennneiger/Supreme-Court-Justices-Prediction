wyatt,
petitioner
vs.
united
states.
mr.
okrand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rissman.
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rissman
in
the
case
you
just
referred
us
to
what
are
--
what
facts
are
there
to
show
that
that
was
a
sham
and
a
fraud
to
distinguish
it
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
connor
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you
mr.
connor
whether
--
whether
this
marriage
occurred
before
or
after
the
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
she
was
the
aggressor
in
--
in
a
mann
act
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
instigator
of
the
interstate
commerce
movement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
connor
when
congress
was
dealing
with
a
similar
matter
that
to
save
women
into
this
country
for
immoral
purposes,
didn't
they
put
into
the
statute
the
fact
that
the
wife
could
testify?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
congress
want
that
to
be
done,
why
wasn't
it
done
here?
and
if
there
is
to
be
a
change
in
rule,
why
shouldn't
congress
make
it
as
it
did
in
that
other
classic
case,
which
is
almost
identical
with
this,
except
one
is
over
the
international
border
and
the
other
is
between
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
why
--
why
wouldn't
it,
it's
--
it's
the
same
thing
with
the
suppression
of
vice
thru
the
instrumentality
of
the
--
of
interstate
commerce?
now,
why
--
why
would
they
thought
about
it
when
they're
bringing
them
into
the
country,
wouldn't
they
think
about
them
moving
them
about
this
country
interstate
for
that
--
for
the
same
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
could
be
more
of
them
--
more
of
them
moving
around
through
the
country
than
there
would
be
brought
in
from
--
from
outside.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
my
only
--
my
--
the
only
reason
i
asked
you
the
question
mr.
conner
was
this.
if
the
rule
is
to
be
changed
concerning
the
marital
relation
and
the
--
the
privileges
that
--
that
go
with
it,
and
congress
has
assumed
to
do
it
in
the
kindred
case,
may
we
bring
woman
in
from
out
of
the
country,
why
wouldn't
the
appropriate
thing
be
for
the
department
of
justice
to
get
congress
to
change
that
--
that
rule.
and
maybe
you
wouldn't
have
many
people
against
you
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
if
we
go
--
if
we
--
we
take
your
view
here
what
we
next
be
confronted
with
sampling
like
this
and
then
makes
a
narcotic
addict
out
of
his
wife
and
then
transports
her
from
one
state
to
--
to
another
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
engaging
in
the
narcotic
traffic.
and
--
and
have
you
here
saying
well
that
so
the
basis,
the
marital
relationship
that
--
that
we
ought
to
ignore
the
exemption
and
we
ought
to
let
her
testify
in
the
case
like
that,
because
she
has
become
an
addict
under
his
influence
perhaps?
wouldn't
those
--
those
things
follow
and
if
--
and
if
we
are
going
to
--
if
the
request
--
if
--
if
a
rule
has
to
be
changed,
shouldn't
it
be
changed
by
congress
as
the
--
as
it
was
in
the
case
of
importation
of
woman
for
immoral
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
because
it
was
an
immorality
against
her,
it
was
because
it
was
an
offense
committed
against
her,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
now
here
you
--
but
here,
you
ask
--
you
ask
us
to
--
to
change
the
rule
and
say
that
even
if
the
wife
was
the
aggressor,
even
if
the
wife
was
the
one
who
was
responsible
for
him
playing
fair
or
doing
something
else
to
bring
her
over,
that
she
is
the
--
she
is
a
victim
in
the
sense,
but
that
woman
was
in
england
when
her
husband
had
one
of
the
another
man
rape
her.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
those
things
follow
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
it
be
implicit
in
the
one
for
the
importation
of
the
woman
for
immoral
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
did
provide
in
that
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
it
in
this
one.
now,
why
should
they
provide
in
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
tried
to
put
it
in
a
--
in
a
different
posture.
you
tried
to
tell
us
that
that
was
the
policy
of
congress,
that
they
wanted
us
to
do
this
thing
because
they
were
trying
to
stomp
off
this
nefarious
traffic.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
say
there
was
one
exception
in
32,
in
1932?
did
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
understand
you
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
--
what
circuit
was
that
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
not
a
--
not
a
court
of
appeals
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
all
the
others
court
of
appeals
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
district
court
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
basis
do
they
do
it
on
--
do
they
agree?
if
they
agree
why
--
that's
first
of
all
i
--
take
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
what
authorities
of
this
court
that
they
go
back
to
in
--
in
deciding
it
on
that
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
state
courts
they
--
they
do
it
very
wisely
by
statute,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
okrand,
is
there
anything
in
the
congressional
record
to
--
to
indicate
why
in
the
case
of
the
importing
women
into
this
country
congress
provided
that
or
gave
--
gave
the
wife
the
right
to
testify
and
then
under
the
mann
act
they
did
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
she
was
charged
--
whether
he
was
charged
with
the
mann
act
or
--
or
whether
he
was
also
charged
with
the
assault.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
beating
is
an
assault,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
we
should
approach
--
approach
that
from
an
individual
case
basis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
if
we're
going
to
open
the
door
at
all,
how
wide
do
we
open
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
i
thought
you
conceded
that
--
that
we
could
sustain
you
in
this
case
and
still
leave
the
door
open
for
other
cases
where
perhaps
there
was
some
coercion
or
something
else
involved
in
--
in
the
transportation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
be
following
any
of
this
court's
cases
that
it
does
create
an
exception
of
the
basis
that
the
offense
is
the
one
committed
against
the
wife.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
restating
again
just
why
you
believe
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
us
to
overrule
any
of
the
cases
in
the
courts
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
without
going
into
each
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
bit
of
that.
