mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
am
mr.
rissman
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
matter
that
comes
before
the
court
on
petition
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
question
of
a
conviction
of
the
petitioner
who
was
convicted
of
transporting
a
woman
in
violation
of
the
mann
act
in
interstate
commerce.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction.
now
although
we
have
two
questions
involved,
namely
whether
a
woman
transported
in
violation
of
the
mann
act
by
a
man
she
subsequently
marries
maybe
compelled
to
testify
against
her
husband
in
the
face
of
his
assertion
of
the
common
law
privilege.
and
secondly,
whether
there
was
sufficient
collaboration
of
the
petitioner's
admissions
of
interstate
commerce
or
interstate
transportation.
it
appears
from
the
government's
brief
at
page
19
that
the
second
point
is
virtually
conceded,
and
that
if
the
court
finds
that
the
admission
of
the
wife's
testimony
was
in
error,
then
we
need
not
to
consider
the
second
point.
the
facts
very
simply
are
these
-
there
was
an
indictment
of
the
petitioner
for
transporting
a
female
mary
kathleen
byrd
from
columbus,
georgia
to
dothan,
alabama.
there's
testimony
of
a
bell
boy
at
the
hotel
in
the
alabama
city
that
he
saw
the
petitioner
and
this
woman
in
the
hotel
room,
that
there
were
various
conversations
between
the
bell
boy
and
the
petitioner
and
the
woman
regarding
business,
referring
apparently
for
the
business
of
prostitution.
there's
testimony
of
a
city
detective
of
the
alabama
city
to
the
effect
that
he
found
bus
ticket
stubs
in
the
possession
of
the
petitioner
and
that
their
was
a
confession
taken
from
the
petitioner,
and
as
related
by
the
city
detective,
the
petitioner
told
him
that
he
had
purchased
two
tickets
in
columbus,
georgia,
that
he
was
going
to
laguna
beach,
florida
but
that
they
stopped
in
dothan,
alabama,
and
then
on
this
trip,
he
was
accompanied
by
mary
byrd.
mary
byrd,
the
wife
then
was
called
to
testify
and
it
appears
that
she
testified
that
she
was
formally
known
as
mary
kathleen
byrd,
that
at
the
time
of
her
testimony,
she
was
married
to
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here.
and
she
then
stated
that
she
refused
to
testify
on
grounds
that
she
was
married
to
the
defendant.
she
offered
to
exhibit
to
the
court
a
marriage
license.
the
court
refused
to
examine
the
license
and
the
court
overruled
her
objection
and
required
her
to
testify.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
pardon
sir?
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
she
was
not
indicted
no
sir.
it
merely
called
as
a
witness
for
the
prosecution.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
they
were
married
after
the
indictment.
the
--
the
record
indicates
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
the
transportation
occurred
before
the
marriage.
so,
we
have
clearly
the
question
of
whether
her
testimony
of
events
that
occurred
before
the
marriage
should
have
been
allowed
over
her
objection
and
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant
himself.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes
sir.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
now
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
no
it
is
not
crystal
clear
but
the
record
indicates
that
the
indictment
in
the
--
at
page
1
refers
to
her
as
mary
kathleen
byrd
and
there
is
her
testimony
of
the
marriage
at
page
22
of
the
record,
in
which
the
prosecutor
asked
her
and
apparently
from
the
examination
there
when
she
says,
he
asked,
“what
is
your
name
ma'am
please?”
answer
-
mary
k.
wyatt.
the
prosecutor
-
“mary
k.
wyatt”
(unbelievingly),
because
apparently
he
expected
her
answer
to
be
mary
k.
byrd.
question
-
“are
you
the
lady
who
was
formally
known
as
mary
kathleen
byrd?”
answer
-
“i
certainly
am.”
question
-
“are
you
related
to
the
defendant
mr.
wyatt?”
answer
-
“that
is
my
husband.”
question
-
“were
you
formerly
married
to
a
rudolph
lindbergh
(ph)?”
answer
-
“yes
i
was.”
and
then
came
the
objection
by
counsel
for
the
defendant.
the
court
says,
get
along.
and
next
question
-
“but
you
are
now
married
to
this
defendant?”
and
then
at
record
57,
i
believe
it
is,
the
circuit
court
for
the
fifth
circuit
says,
“the
fact
that
the
transportation
occurred
before
marriage
certainly
would
not
any
the
more
disqualify
the
wife.”
so
that
the
court
assumed
that
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes
and
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes
sir.
and
they
testify
--
the
same
witness
testified
that
the
defendant
also
told
him
in
subsequent
statements
that
he
was
married
to
the
woman
after
the
transportation.
so,
there
is
some
--
some
ambiguity
in
the
record
at
most
on
this
question,
but
the
court
below
assumed
that
the
marriage
occurred
after
the
transportation.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
the
--
the
trial
court
said
it
didn't
make
any
difference
and
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
the
transportation
occurred
after
the
--
before
the
marriage.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that's
right
there
was
an
attempt
by
the
prosecutor
to
establish
that
there
was
no
valid
merit,
but
the
trial
court
did
not
permit
them
to
go
in
to
that
question.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that's
correct.
of
course
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
it
is
our
position
that
they're
not
relevant
because
i
think
it
makes
no
difference
under
the
rule
and
the
exception
whether
they
were
or
were
not
married
at
the
time
of
the
event.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that
--
i
think
it
makes
it
a
stronger
case
in
the
--
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
here
if
they
were
not
married
but
actually
the
question
involved
and
the
question
to
be
decided
by
the
court
does
not
have
to
rest
upon
that
fact.
now,
the
common
law
rule
of
course
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
if
they
were
unmarried
at
the
time
of
the
event,
because
the
exception
to
the
general
rule,
the
general
rule
would
be
that
the
wife
cannot
be
compelled
or
not
permitted
to
testify
against
the
husband
except
for
an
injury
to
the
wife.
now,
if
she
was
not
his
wife
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
incident
then
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that's
right.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
no.
i
--
i
think
the
case
has
seemed
to
say
an
offense
against
the
wife
and
--
and
presumes
a
marriage
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
so
if
she
was
not
a
wife
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
apply
the
exception
and
as
i
will
attempt
to
indicate
that
the
fact
that
marriage
comes
later
would
seem
to
support
the
general
principle
that
the
privilege
is
to
be
permitted
and
the
testimony
is
not
to
be
allowed
in
order
to
obtain
the
reason
for
the
general
rule
in
the
first
instance
namely
to
preserve
marital
harmony
and
to
prevent
any
marital
breach.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that
is
correct.
well,
the
hawkins
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
the
exception
does
not
commend
because
there
was
no
injury
to
the
wife.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
because
there
was
no
wife
at
the
time.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
no
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
no,
because
the
transportation
is
an
offense
against
society
but
that
is
not
the
--
the
test
as
to
whether
the
wife
should
or
should
not
be
permitted
to
testify.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
--
i
think
it
could
be,
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
--
it
--
it
certainly
could
be
an
offense
against
her.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
it
was
an
offense
against
the
woman,
i
don't
--
but
it
was
not
an
offense
against
the
wife,
and
the
exception
prevails
not
because
of
an
offense
against
a
person
but
an
offense
against
a
person
who
is
a
wife.
the
exception
being
necessary
to
support
the
rule
itself,
which
says,
we
will
not
permit
such
testimony
because
the
danger
of
permitting
a
wife
to
testify
against
her
husband
results
in
burdens
upon
the
marital
relationship.
and
it
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
no
sir,
it's
not
an
injury
to
her
and
the
crime
exists
merely
because
the
statute
says
it
is
a
crime
and
it's
similar
to
the
cases
of
statutory
rape
and
--
and
the
--
but
the
question
of
her
consent
is
immaterial.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that's
right.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
in
--
in
the
personal
sense,
it
does
not
because
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
this
transportation
was
against
her
will.
in
fact
the
--
the
evidence
is
quite
to
the
contrary
she
always
said
it
was
quite
a
voluntary
transportation
and
consented
to
her
by
--
on
her
part.
so
there
was
no
offense
against
her
in
a
sense
that
there
was
any
injury
to
her.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
he
was
trying
for
transporting
this
woman
in
interstate
commerce
for
immoral
purposes.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
he
was
trying
for
an
--
he
was
being
tried
for
an
offense
against
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
--
the
united
states
against
the
act
itself.
now,
we
submit
that
the
question
of
whether
the
testimony
of
the
wife
is
necessary,
namely
the
basis
for
the
rule
of
the
exception
or
for
the
invocation
of
the
exception,
presupposes
a
particular
necessity
for
the
wife,
namely
a
necessity
to
vindicate
her
rights
or
to
protect
her
from
personal
harm,
as
the
cases
say,
or
otherwise
the
wife
would
be
exposed
without
remedy
to
personal
injury.
and
it
is
the
wife's
necessity
for
a
protection,
and
lastly,
prosecutor's
necessity
to
get
a
conviction
that
permits
the
abrogation
of
the
general
rule
and
permits
the
invocation
of
the
exception.
the
court,
of
course,
is
authorized
under
rule
26
of
the
federal
rule
to
modify
this
rule
and
to
revoke
the
exception
or
to
broaden
it
as
the
case
may
be
in
the
length
of
reason
and
experience,
and
this
was
the
holding
in
the
hawkins
case
as
recently
as
just
one
year
ago.
and
there's
been
no
demonstration
in
this
record
that
reason
and
experience
require
that
the
public
interest
inherent
in
the
promulgation
of
the
general
rule
should
be
further
modified
or
as
to
be
equated
against
the
necessity
of
the
testimony
as
against
the
enforcement
of
the
mann
act.
this
is
a
situation
here,
where
the
wife,
the
woman
having
married
the
man
after
the
offense,
having
refused
to
testify
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
we
have
the
situation
of
a
marital
status
that
can
be
preserved
and
that
can
be
further
enhanced,
and
to
permit
the
testimony
at
this
time
is
directly
in
face
of
the
rule
of
preserving
marital
harmony.
now,
in
the
hawkins
case
this
court,
applying
the
rule
of
reason
and
experience,
refused
to
permit
even
voluntary
testimony
of
a
wife,
where
the
wife
was
willing
to
testify
and
in
a
situation
where
apparently
there
was
no
marital
status
to
preserve.
the
testimony
there
was
that
the
husband
and
wife
did
not
live
together
for
many
years
and
the
--
there
was
no
risk
of
disturbing
a
nonexistent
marital
harmony
situation.
now,
how
much
more
compelling
are
the
facts
here
where
the
wife
refuses
to
testify,
where
the
wife
became
the
wife
after
the
offense
which
is
charged
against
the
defendant
and
which
supports
the
basis
of
the
original
privilege.
the
--
if
we
may
borrow
from
something
we
learned
in
the
argument
of
the
previous
case,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
argument
raised
by
the
government
here
that
in
a
mann
act
violation,
where
there
is
an
offense
against
the
very
situation
of
matrimony,
where
there
is
apparently
an
obstruction
to
the
marital
status,
the
exception
should
prevail
and
the
rule
should
not
and
taking
our
clue
from
the
arguments
we
heard,
it
would
appear
that
there
are
many
pollutants
and
much
debris
discharged
into
the
stream
of
marital
status,
but
most
of
these
pollutants
and
most
of
these
obstructions,
our
(inaudible)
counsel
in
the
other
case
said
are
in
suspension
and
many
of
them
are
dissipated
or
washed
away
and
disappear.
but
it's
only
those
pollutants
which
are
settleable
which
create
obstruction.
and
we
submit
that
to
compel
a
wife
to
testify
against
her
husband
or
even
to
permit
her
to
testify
if
she
is
willing
is
to
permit
settleable
obstructions
in
this
matrimonial
stream
which
can
leave
to
obstruction.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
think
it
--
it
--
it
goes
back
even
further
than
that
if
your
honor
please.
and
although
in
the
other
case
we
heard
about
the
99.98%
purity
of
the
water
that
is
returned
to
the
stream,
in
this
type
of
situation
we
need
a
100%
purity.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
think
there
is,
there
is
where
the
wife
says,
“i
refuse
to
testify”
and
it
isn't
in
particular
situation,
because
although
there
may
be
burdens
imposed
upon
the
prosecutor,
although
he
may
not
be
able
to
give
a
conviction
without
the
testimony
of
the
wife,
we
submit
that
it's
better
to
impose
the
burden
on
the
prosecutor
and
perhaps
not
yet
as
many
mann
act
convictions
than
to
perhaps
allow
obstructions
which
will
lead
to
marital
discord
and
marital
disharmony.
i
want
to
anti
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
you
say
is
it
possible?
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
think
the
social
policy
is
to
preserve
any
marriage
and
particularly
in
the
case
where
the
wife
herself
claims
the
privilege,
because
apparently
she
is
willing
to
preserve
that
marriage
and
is
not
willing
to
testify.
i
submit
that
the
distinction
that
the
government
tried
to
make
in
the
hawkins
case
was
just
that.
they
said
that
where
she
is
wiling
to
testify
as
she
should
be
permitted
to
do
so
and
it's
different
than
compulsion.
what
this
court
said
and
i
submit
rightfully
that
there
should
be
no
distinction
between
the
compelled
testimony
and
the
volunteered
testimony.
now,
the
government
says,
we
agree
with
hawkins
but
we
think
we
ought
to
go
further
and
require
even
compelled
even
a
--
a
testimony
that
is
not
volunteered.
we
should
be
able
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that's
correct
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
mann
act
--
if
congress
had
intended
that
to
mann
act
have
a
special
rule,
it
would
have
so
provided,
because
there
have
been
special
rules
provided
in
the
act
which
forbids
the
importation
of
aliens
for
immoral
purposes.
in
1917
8
u.s.c.
1328
the
statute
there
specifically
permits
the
testimony
of
one
spouse
against
another,
and
in
the
polygamy
statutes,
at
24
stat.
635,
the
statute
specifically,
in
that
case,
permitted
testimony
of
one
spouse
against
another
but
did
not
compel
it.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i'm
not
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
--
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
certain
as
to
what
the
report
said,
but
all
i
like
to
do
is
assume
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
the
exception
or
otherwise
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
insert
a
--
had
in
mind
the
rule,
otherwise
there
would
be
no
need
to
insert
the
exception.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes.
now
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
would
prefer
not
to
express
any
opinion
about
the
mind
of
congress
if
the
court
please.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
now,
the
--
i
want
to
anticipate
that
counsel
for
the
government
were
referred
to
the
lutwak
case,
that's
344
u.s.
604,
in
which
case
the
--
the
rule
was
not
followed
and
the
wife
was
permitted
to
testify
against
the
husband.
that
was
a
case
involving
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
immigration
act
where
the
court
found,
in
effect,
that
the
marriage
in
that
case
was,
as
the
court
said,
“a
sham
and
a
fraud”
and
said
further,
in
a
sham,
phony,
empty
ceremony
such
as
the
parties
went
through
in
this
case.
the
reason
for
the
rule,
disqualifying
a
spouse
from
giving
testimony
disappears
and
with
it
the
rule.
the
reason
for
the
rule
at
common
law
was
to
protect
the
sanctity
and
tranquility
of
the
marital
relationship,
and
where
there
was
no
marital
relationship,
where
the
parties
never
intended
to
be
married,
there
is
no
reason
to
enforce
the
rules.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
it
--
it
might
be,
but
that
of
course
is
not
the
situation
here
and
as
was
--
the
court
said
in
the
hawkins
case
i
believe
your
honor
said
in
your
separate
concurring
opinion
in
the
reason
of
--
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience,
there
should
be
some
demonstration
that
the
exception
should
be
broadened,
so
that
if
perhaps
there
were
--
there
was
no
sanctity
and
was
no
tranquility
that
the
testimony
should
be
permitted.
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
this
is
anything
but
a
proper
and
--
and
valid
marriage
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
form.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
think
it
might
be
possible
for
the
court
to
limit
the
exception,
but
then
the
court
imposes
the
burden
upon
itself
and
treating
this
on
a
ad
hoc
basis
in
each
case,
and
this
is
not
what
the
government
is
asking.
the
government
is
asking
for
a
blanket
of
permission
or
abrogation
of
the
rule
in
mann
act
cases.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
generally,
that
is
true.
and
this
--
the
--
but
this
is
analogous
of
course
to
the
many
cases
in
--
in
similar
situations
but
not
involving
the
mann
act,
the
statutory
rape
cases,
for
example,
in
which
the
subsequent
marriage
of
the
parties
is
always
acted
as
a
barred
testimony
of
one
spouse
against
the
other.
and
we
submit
that
the
general
good
is
better
served
by
not
permitting
spousal
testimony
one
against
the
other,
then
to
let
down
the
barriers
at
all
with
reference
to
mann
act
cases.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
no
sir.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
--
is
essential
for
our
position.
i
say
it
perhaps
strengthens
our
position,
but
i
think
it's
immaterial
whether
they
were
or
were
not
married
before
the
offense.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
in
the
lutwak
case
your
honor?
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes.
the
--
the
war
brides
case.
i
believe
there
was
a
testimony
in
those
records
that
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
the
fact
in
those
cases
were
these.
ex
gis,
went
over
to
paris
and
married
foreign
women
and
some
cases
some
ex-gi
women
went
to
paris
and
married
foreign
men
for
the
express
purpose
of
bringing
them
under
the
war
brides
act,
which
permitted
them
to
enter
the
united
states
without
waiting
for
any
particular
quote
or
regulation.
but
the
understanding,
and
the
record
indicates
this,
the
understanding
at
the
time
of
the
ceremony
was
we
will
get
married
in
formally
and
as
soon
as
this
--
we
--
we
can,
we
will
dissolve
the
marriage,
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened.
they
came
to
the
united
states,
having
evaded
the
immigration
law,
they
then
dissolved
the
marriage.
and
in
some
cases
before
the
dissolution
of
the
marriage
and
in
some
cases
after
the
indictments
were
drawn.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
no
sir
i
don't,
because
i
--
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
any
difference
it
--
it
--
as
i
say
it
straightens
our
position
if
we
say
that
she
was
as
justice
frankfurter,
a
voluntary
victim
as
against
a
--
a
woman
at
a
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
well,
in
our
general
theory,
it
--
it
makes
no
difference
but
in
this
case
particularly,
we
say
for
two
reasons
she
was
not
the
victim.
number
one
--
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
say
our
case
isn't
dependent
upon
that
question
of
law.
i
think
the
record
would
indicate
that
she
was
not
the
victim
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
they
were
not
married
at
the
time,
she
was
not
a
wife
of
the
victim.
and
secondly,
she
was
a
volunteer.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
--
i
think
it's
one
that
we
have
urged
in
our
brief,
but
i
don't
think
its
essential
to
our
--
to
our
case.
mr.
robert
r.
rissman
i
would
understand
that
to
mean
one
who
finds
himself
in
a
set
of
circumstances
is
not
of
his
own
desire
or
--
or
responsibility
or
doing.
i
would
reserve
whatever
time
remains
if
the
court
pleases
to
mr.
okrand.
thank
you.
