justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
cite
in
the
act
(inaudible)
against
her?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
you
shouldn't.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
would
say
i
think
if
you
put
it
(inaudible)
your
point
of
view,
it
is
not
marriage
at
the
stage
determined
by
hawkins?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
exception
doesn't
commend?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
she
was
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
are
you
going
to
argue
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
fact
the
transportation
across
state
lines
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you're
not
contesting?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
find
this
is
an
offense
against
the
united
states
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right,
but
is
it
proper
on
these
facts
(inaudible)
offense
against
her?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
quite
obvious
if
a
woman
(inaudible)
under
circumstances
as
broad
that
we
(inaudible),
it
is
an
offense
against
her
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
suppose
that
she
--
suppose
(inaudible)
is
an
offense
against
her
in
that
sense?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
was
he
had
been
trying
for?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
an
offense
against
her
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
would
it
have
made
this
difference,
if
she
is
not
the
victim,
then
doesn't
hawkins
simply
say
she's
not
a
competent
witness?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
you
said
it
makes
no
difference?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
won't
you
say,
she
won't
make
it
in
its
point
that
she
was
not
the
victim?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then,
do
you
urge
that
--
the
point
that
she
was
not
the
victim?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
why
it's
a
public
offense
and
the
consent
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
under
the
exception,
that
could
be
here
the
victim
or,
as
i
would
say
it,
the
offense
must
be
one
against
her?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
does
that
apply
to
(inaudible)
mann
act
not
to
accept
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
would
that
be
--
that's
against
her,
wouldn't
that
be?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
if
we
apply
to
mann
act
case,
it
might
be
--
would
it
apply
then
rationally
to
all
cases?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose
we
reject
the
work
victim
and
we
use
language
of
exception
in
an
offense
against
her,
is
this
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
