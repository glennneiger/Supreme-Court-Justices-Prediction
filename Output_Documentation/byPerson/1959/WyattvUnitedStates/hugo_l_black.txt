justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
the
presumption
is
she's
a
voluntary
victim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
i
asked
you
so,
if
you
were
making
any
point
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
and
what
do
you
think
it
means
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
that
husband
wife
has
decided
for
stealing
together.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
suppose
he
persuaded
her
to
do
it.
(inaudible)
persuaded
to
bribe,
become
a
burglar
or
thief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
assume
that's
the
reason
here
that
he's
contributing
to
the
--
theoretically
worsening
of
her
morals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
persuaded
her
to
do
it,
to
grab
and
have
her
in
the
occupation
of
a
thief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
she
testify
--
may
be
testified
against
him
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
necessity
to
convict
people
of
the
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
you
undoubted
that
cases
that
support
that
position
where
the
husband
strikes
the
wife
and
beats
her
up
and
something
like
that.
do
you
have
anything
that
support
it
where
the
husband
does
something
she
wants
him
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
she
consent
to
the
assault
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
undoubtedly
be
a
change
of
policy
wouldn't
it?
i
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assume
that
this
court
lets
the
wife
do
it
testify
or
force
her
to
testify
to
that
extent
it
reaches
the
rule
that
she
can't
be
made
to
testify
against
her
husband
even
the
rule
if
you
accept
it
as
that
she
can't
be
made
to
testify
against
her
husband
except
when
she
is
the
victim
of
something
he
does
to
her.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
claim
it,
you
don't
claim
it
come
under
--
it
come
in
under
that
category,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
irrational
intention?
it
might
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
hasn't
it
been
held
and
the
(inaudible)
drawn
so
far
as
the
language
is
concerned
that
the
rule
applies
except
when
she
is
the
victim
of
her
husband
or
he
does
something
directed
to
her.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
and
you
would
--
do
you
think
this
is
--
it
can
be
said
to
be
an
offense
against
the
wife
when
she
wanted
to
go?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think,
because
it's
so
bad,
it's
such
a
bad
thing
for
the
wife
to
do
that,
that
it
could
be
considered
as
an
offense,
even
though
that's
precisely
what
she
wants
to
do
and
that's
the
practice
of
her
life?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
privilege
that
could
be
taken
away
from.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
bad
if
he
had
helped
her
in
committing
a
crime
or
--
or
going
across
the
border
and
stealing
an
automobile
and
bringing
it
back?
wouldn't
that
be
the
same
nature
of
an
offense
against
her
and
it
does
degrade
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
difference
in
degree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assaulted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
agree
with
you
to
my
feeling
about
it,
but
she
didn't
seem
to
think
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
point
i
was
getting
at
was
that
maybe
that
your
arguments
mr.
connor
was
that
the
conduct
is
so
bad,
so
reprehensible,
and
so
unpleasing
to
you
and
me
that
we
ought
to
make
this
rule
extend
to
it
even
though
she
was
not
a
victim
and
she
did
decide
what
she
wanted
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here
is
a
question
of
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
indicate
the
congressional
policy
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
convict
him,
does
it?
i've
looked
at
this
record;
did
you
need
her
evidence
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
will
concede,
but
as
when
i
looked
at
it,
i
didn't
see
what
it
was.
i
--
i
just
don't
see
it
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
i
--
i'm
wondering
how
much
--
how
many
times
it
is
necessary
in
connection
with
establishing
the
policy
that
you
wanted
to
establish,
that
this
is
so
bad
that
we
ought
to
say
that
a
wife
who
wants
her
husband
to
take
her
across
the
border,
so
he
can
go
to
jail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
her
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
connor
in
order
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
mann
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
if
we
have
to
overrule
that
in
question,
to
reverse?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
demand
us
to
reverse.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
hold
with
you,
would
we
have
to
overrule
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see.
who?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
comes
--
if
it
wasn't
merely
transportation
but
compulsion
entering
into
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
aren't
those
pretty
thin
lines
if
we're
going
to
break
into
the
rules?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
privilege
rule
that
is
heretofore
bit
enforced
by
this
court.
