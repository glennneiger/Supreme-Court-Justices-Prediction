mr.
fred
okrand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
direct
my
remarks
at
first
to
some
things
that
mr.
connor
said.
he
opened
the
--
opened
his
argument
by
suggesting
to
this
court,
i
think,
that
the
marital
privilege
which
is
before
this
court
is
a
very
small
matter.
it
isn't
very
important.
and
so
if
you
whittle
away
at
this
privilege,
the
court
will
not
have
done
very
much,
because
it's
important
to
get
convictions.
this
is
as
i
viewed
mr.
connor's
opening
remarks.
well,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
every
privilege
has
the
effect
that
the
government
counsel
has
suggested
to
this
one
and
that
the
marital
privilege
is
a
very
important
privilege.
it
isn't
one
that
someone
has
thought
up
yesterday
or
the
day
before.
it's
at
least
300
years
old.
and
as
rule
26
says,
it
should
take
a
lot
of
reason
and
a
lot
of
experience
before
it's
overturned.
and
mr.
connor
made
some
rather
important
remarks,
i
think,
when
he
told
the
court
that
the
government
has
never
felt
it
necessary
to
go
to
congress
to
get
a
change
in
the
rule.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
significant.
the
mann
act
was
passed
in
1910,
that's
50
years
ago.
and
the
government
has
never
yet
felt
itself
hampered
in
mann
act
prosecutions
certainly
involving
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
fred
okrand
all
right.
that's
only
partly
true,
mr.
justice
stewart.
every
single
case
which
has
permitted
the
wife
to
testify
has
been
a
true
case
of
a
wife
being
transported
which
is
not
the
fact
at
this
case.
and
every
--
every
cases
involved
the
permission
of
the
wife
to
testify.
that
is
if
the
wife
wants
to
testify.
that
is
not
the
fact
of
this
case.
this
case
--
mr.
fred
okrand
every
one
of
them.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
correct.
now,
so
we
don't
have
--
so
those
cases
which
your
honor
or
--
or
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
or
mr.
justice
clark
whether
they
would
be
overruled
by
a
reversal
of
this
case
do
not
apply.
mr.
fred
okrand
if
you
made
that
distinction
--
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
but
may
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
that
is
again
not
the
facts
of
this
case
because
as
we
--
as
we
urge,
this
is
not
a
wife
and,
so
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
--
the
hawkins
case
at
all.
that
is
--
doesn't
fall
within
the
exception
which
the
government
is
--
is
arguing
for
and
if
she
is
not
a
wife,
that
disposes
off
this
case.
mr.
fred
okrand
no.
no,
i
--
perhaps
i
didn't
make
myself
understood.
if
she
was
not
a
wife
at
the
time
of
the
event
which
is
the
fact
of
this
case
not
that
she
was
not
a
wife
at
the
time
of
the
testimony.
and
we
say
if
she's
not
a
wife
at
the
time
of
the
event,
then
the
exception
cannot
come
into
play
because
of
the
very
rationale
of
allowing
the
wife
to
testify,
is
that
if
there
was
an
offense
against
her.
which
brings
me
to
another
point
and
that
is
and
i
may
touch
a
little
bit
about
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said.
this
will
not
violate
the
policy
which
was
sought
to
be
affected
by
the
mann
act.
in
alleged
--
in
the
house
report
which
was
--
which
is
referred
to
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
10,
the
congress
said,
the
--
the
majority
said,
that
the
minority
didn't
want
to
pass
the
bill
all
together.
the
majority
said
that
the
legislation
does
not
attempt
to
regulate
the
practice
of
voluntary
prostitution
but
aimed
solely
to
prevent
panderers
and
procurers
from
compelling
thousands
of
women
and
girls
against
their
will
and
desire
to
enter
and
continue
in
the
life
of
prostitution.
now,
this
case
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
policy
that
congress
is
trying
to
effectuate
by
the
passage
of
the
manner.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
wife
being
compelled.
it's
certainly
a
case
of
voluntariness
that
the
record
means
what
--
what
it
says.
and
one
further
point,
your
honor
--
mr.
fred
okrand
oh
no.
no,
we're
not
saying
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
mann
act,
but
we're
saying
that
allowing
the
marital
privilege
will
not
violate
any
policy
that
the
mann
act
sought
to
prevent,
because
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
--
if
you
see
the
mann
act
your
honor,
if
we
read
--
if
i
read
the
congressional
history
correctly,
it
was
designed
to
reach
this
widespread
traffic,
these
--
these
syndicates
which
have
been
growing
out,
this
commercialized
vice
to
use
the
term
of
mr.
connor,
businesses.
and
the
report
showed
that
one
man
made
$102,000
a
year
or
something
in
1908.
that
isn't
this
case
here.
now,
one
further
statement
in
the
--
in
history
is
important,
i
think,
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
as
to
what
marital
relation
we
have
to
preserve
here.
in
a
report,
the
majority
said,
its
victims,
meaning
the
wife
slave
victims,
are
those
women
and
girls
who
have
given
a
fair
chance
within
all
human
probability
have
been
good
wives
and
mothers
and
useful
citizens.
now,
i
--
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
where
there
was
an
offense
before
the
marriage,
but
where
there
has
been
a
marriage
and
the
wife
seeks
to
preserve
that
marriage,
that
this
court
ought
not
without
some
substantial
showing
of
some
kind
which
is
not
brought
before
this
court
overturned
the
--
the
long
historical
marital
privilege.
mr.
fred
okrand
no.
mr.
fred
okrand
we
don't
--
we
don't
suggest
that
there's
a
condonation.
first
of
all
condonation
means
that
he
hasn't
--
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted,
i
suppose,
for
the
crime.
it
isn't
--
the
word
“condonation”
or
“condone”
isn't
a
good
word,
if
i
may
suggest,
mr.
justice
harlan.
what
we're
saying
is
by
marrying
him
she's
trying
to
lead
a
good
life
which
the
congress
wanted
her
to
do.
and
that
if
this
court
says
that
she
must
testify
against
him
over
her
protest
that
the
marriage
which
he
has
finally
sought
will
be
broken
up
and
--
and
the
very
policy
that
congress
wanted
to
effectuate
will
be
defeated.
if
i
may
--
mr.
fred
okrand
did
not.
i
have
not
read
the
congressional
record
--
the
congressional
history
concerning
the
polygamy
statute
or
the
alien
statute,
so
i
don't
know
why
they
put
it
in
that
statute.
i
haven't
read
most
of
what
i've
been
able
to
find
at
the
congressional
record
on
this
statute.
and
this
statute
says
nothing
about
congress
trying
to
do
away
with
any
marital
privilege.
i
did
find
in
the
--
one
of
the
appendices
or
exhibits
to
the
report
of
the
act,
of
the
mann
act
bill,
that
there
was
a
comment
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
where
there
was
a
the
report
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
referring
to
aliens
in
which
he
said
that
the
traffic
of
aliens
into
the
country
for
prostitution
that
some
prosecutions
will
be
hampered
in
those
offenses
because
some
of
the
women
were
marrying
some
of
the
men
and
becoming
united
states
citizens
under
the
law
at
that
time,
the
wife
by
marrying
became
a
citizen.
and
therefore,
the
sanction
of
deportation
could
not
be
used
against
them.
and
the
secretary
of
commerce
had
suggested
that
some
change
should
be
made
in
the
naturalization
law
so
that
a
woman
of
bad
moral
character
who
married
a
man
could
not
become
a
citizen.
and
that
indeed
is
what
was
done
later
on.
and
--
and
of
course
also
as
we
know
in
1917,
they
passed
a
law
in
permitting
wives
to
testify
against
husbands
in
cases
involving
alien
importation.
but
why
they
did
it
in
the
alien
cases
and
why
they
did
not
do
it
in
the
mann
act
case,
i
just
--
just
don't
know
the
answer
to.
there's
one
factual
statement
in
the
--
the
beginning
of
mr.
rissman's
argument
that
i
think
there's
some
confusion
about.
i
--
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
asked
mr.
rissman
if
the
record
shows
that
mrs.
wyatt
married
after
the
indictment
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that.
i
--
i
don't
think
it
shows
when
they
were
married
except
that
they
were
married
after
the
offense.
that
i
think
the
record
is
very
clear
on
and
we
must
accept
what
the
lower
court
--
we
think
we
must
accept
what
the
lower
court
did
set
on.
but
whether
it
was
they
married
after
the
indictment
or
before
the
indictment,
i
don't
think
the
record
is
--
is
clear
on
this.
mr.
fred
okrand
no
we
don't
think
so.
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
at
all.
i
think
--
mr.
fred
okrand
it
might
make
a
difference.
i
--
i
was
going
to
sum
up
by
--
by
touching
on
that.
we
think
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
a
reversal
because
of
the
facts
of
this
case
on
anyone
of
three
factual
items
or
--
or
because
there
is
a
combination
of
all
three.
number
one,
we
think
that
because
the
marriage
was
before
or
was
after
the
offense,
that
the
marital
relationship
applies
that
there
--
and
that
there
is
no
exception
to
be
applied
at
all
because
there
is
no
offense
against
the
wife.
number
one.
number
two,
we
think
it
is
possible
although
we
recognized
that
the
court
rejected
such
a
theory
in
the
hawkins
case,
although
i
shall
--
also
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
congress
didn't
reject
such
a
theory
on
the
polygamy
statute
when
they
said
that
the
wife
might
testify
but
cannot
be
compelled.
we
think
that
it
is
also
possible
that
in
the
case
where
the
wife
claims
the
privilege
and
is
thereby
seeking
to
maintain
the
marital
relationship
that
the
court
could
make
a
distinction
on
those
lines.
and
three,
we
think
that
this
is
not
a
wife
that
a
mann
act
prosecution,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
cannot
properly
and
reasonably
be
brought
within
the
term
wife
victim,
because
we
don't
think
that
the
word
“victim”
is
a
correct
description
of
what
the
exception
was
meant
to
cover.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
would
say
no,
that
it
is
not.
certainly,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
where
there
was
a
voluntary
participation.
now,
if
there
were
a
factual
situation
where
there
were
true
coercion
and
beating
or
whatever
it
maybe,
which
apparently
was
with
the
mann
act
was
--
was
designed
to
get
at,
i
try
might
answer
that
question
differently,
but
not
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
fred
okrand
it
might
in
that
limited
case,
in
that
limited
sense.
now
--
mr.
fred
okrand
well
no.
we
--
we
don't
--
we
aren't
talking
about
an
assault
situation.
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
a
voluntary
consent
to
an
assault.
i
--
i
--
mr.
fred
okrand
beating
is
an
assault,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
but
what
the
government
is
trying
to
get
is
an
exception
curved
out
under
the
mann
act
situation.
mr.
fred
okrand
and
i
say
or
we
say
that
under
a
mann
act
situation,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
there
might
be
a
difference
depending
upon
whether
the
wife
was
truly
a
victim
in
the
sense
of
voluntarily
engaging
in
this
transportation.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
right.
mr.
fred
okrand
no.
i
--
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
with
the
limited
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
fred
okrand
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
open
the
door.
that's
our
point.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes
sir.
if
our
argument
that
she
was
not
a
wife
victim
because
it
occurred
before
the
marriage
is
not
accepted,
and
if
our
--
our
suggestion
that
there
is
a
difference
between
voluntary
and
compelled
testimony
is
not
accepted,
and
then
--
and
the
court
has
only
the
third
basis,
namely
that
she
was
not
a
--
that
she
was
a
--
a
voluntary
participant
in
this
and
therefore
was
not
an
offense
against
her.
only
in
that
case,
would
future
cases
be
opened
for
--
for
a
factual
determination.
but
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
because
there
was
a
marriage
before
the
--
because
there
was
the
offense
before
the
marriage,
therefore,
the
whole
business
doesn't
apply
and
the
--
the
marital
privilege
applies,
because
she
is
the
wife
now,
then
of
course,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that.
i
wonder
--
i
think
i
made
it
clear
that
our
view
is
that
if
the
court
sustains
us,
it
will
not
be
overruling
any
lower
court
cases.
not
be
overruling
because
there
are
no
cases
which
has
the
--
the
three
facts
which
are
present
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
think
i
suppose
the
landmark
case
of
this
court
which
talks
about
the
offense
against
the
wife
is
the
stein
case
which
was
a
civil
case
in
probate
matter.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
of
this
court.
mr.
fred
okrand
it
said
--
it
said
where
there
was
an
offense
against
the
wife?
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
would
be
following
any
other
precedent
of
this
court
if
they
held
that
this
kind
of
an
offense
was
an
offense
against
wife.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
don't
know.
in
the
--
in
the
--
it
was
a
physical
offense
in
the
stein.
what
is
that?
over
this
top
--
mr.
fred
okrand
all
right.
mr.
fred
okrand
mr.
connor
tells
me
that
i
might
be
reading
the
stein
case
is
incorrect
that
there
was
no
offense
actually
but
there
was
just
dictum.
i
--
i
thought
--
mr.
fred
okrand
that
it
was
dictum
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
in
the
case.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
don't
know
of
any.
so,
to
conclude,
we
--
we
suggest
that
if
the
court
sustains
us,
it
will
be
following
long
established
precedence.
it
will
not
be
overruling
nor
touching
on
any
case
that
was
decided
by
this
court
and
will
not
be
overruling
any
of
the
lower
federal
courts.
mr.
fred
okrand
lower
courts.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
all
the
cases
in
the
lower
courts
that
--
that
i
--
i
know
of
involved
cases
of
offenses
either
against
the
wife
while
she
was
a
wife
or
involved
cases
where
the
wife
wanted
to
testify,
voluntarily
came
before
the
court
to
testify.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
they
are.
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
break
into
the
rule.
mr.
fred
okrand
into
--
into
the
privilege
rule
i
thought
mr.
justice
black
was
saying.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
right.
as
i
read
the
hawkins
case
and
the
cases
before,
this
court
has
upheld
the
marital
privilege.
i
thought
it
was
an
important
one
to
uphold
and
has
refused
to
allowing
those
in
it.
and
so
we
think
this
is
not
the
case
to
--
to
start.
thank
you
very
much.
