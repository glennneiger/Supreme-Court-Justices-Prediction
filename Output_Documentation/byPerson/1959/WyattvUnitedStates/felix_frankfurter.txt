before
the
marriage
and
--
and
the
marriage
that
you
replied
to
the
chief
justice
was
supervening
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
it's
assuming
i
say
assuming
that
it
is
legally
relevant
whether
the
transportation
occurred
before
marriage
and
further
assuming
that
it
is
legally
relevant
that
the
indictment
preceded
the
marriage.
assume
those
two
things
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
the
claim
of
--
of
disqualification,
the
claim
of
immunity
from
the
duty
to
testify
would
rest
on
the
witness,
would
it
not?
whether
--
all
right,
i've
put
that
in
one
sided,
it
all
there's
in
--
there
was
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
were
these
immunizing
elements
namely
that
the
marriage
was
--
the
marriage
preceded
the
transaction
in
controversy
and
the
marriage
preceded
the
indictment,
the
burden
of
showing
that
certainly
was
not
undertaking
or
--
or
established
by
the
witness,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
showing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
would
undercut
the
whole
case,
would
it
not?
well,
assuming
their
was
a
marriage
and
assuming
that
--
that
the
marriage
couldn't
colloquially
be
contested,
if
it
be
relevant
that
the
transactions
precede
the
marriage
and
if
it
be
relevant
that
the
indictment
preceded
marriage
assuming
whether
the
burden
of
establishing
relief
from
the
duty
of
testifying
is
on
a
witness,
that
burden
was
not
undertaken
or
established
here,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
any
of
these
things
are
relevant
i'm
just
wondering
what
--
where
we
are
at?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
fully
appreciate
that
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
it's
stronger
if
--
if
they
were
unmarried
at
the
time
of
the
event?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
--
are
you
suggesting
that
this
case
involves
the
formulation
or
the
restatement
at
the
effect
of
a
general
rule
rather
than
make
a
special
rule
through
mann
act
cases,
because
if
this
--
the
mann
act
situation
is
the
only
one
in
which
this
problem
arises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
either
--
the
report
on
either
of
those
two
enactments
--
does
that
report
disclose
that
congress
consciously
was
making
it
an
exception
or
an
immunity
which
it
recognized?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
makes
--
the
statute
makes,
if
that's
what
you
said,
namely
to
affirm
it
legally,
allows
that
kind
of
testimony.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
in
the
report
on
the
legislation,
there
were
reports
that
dealt
with,
or
most
probably
would,
whether
congress
said
we
think
in
--
for
these
purposes
the
rule,
the
accepted
rule
that
the
wife
can
testify
against
her
husband
should
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
have
wanted
to
make
sure
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
mind
of
congress
is
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
did
neither,
i
said
that's
a
difficult
thing
to
think
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rissman,
at
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
beginning
of
your
argument
you
laid
stress
on
what
you
seem
to
be
the
fact,
and
i
don't
know
anything
about
that
--
that's
the
record,
that
this
was
a
voluntary
transaction
so
far
as
the
woman
would
consider.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
is
so
and
that
assumption,
suggest
that
this
be
brought
within
the
rubric
of
victims,
widen
it
up
that
she's
a
victim,
opens
up
a
very
serious
sociological
problem
so
far
as
i
think
the
literature
of
prostitution
goes
that
whatever
one
--
we
may
think
here,
it
isn't
true
to
say
that
the
prostitute
is
always
a
victim,
and
the
relationship
between
man
and
prostitute
wife
is
very
different
than
one
would
assume
from
at
least
kind
of
experience
that
i
had,
and
i
suppose
most
of
us
had,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
great
body
of
literature
indicating
quite
the
content.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
good
contradictory
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
claimant's
second
point
does
force
me
to
assume
that
that
in
(inaudible)
marriage
relation
(inaudible).
we
assume
that
the
law
happened
to
introduce
elements
that's
furthered
to
this
court,
if
this
court
has
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
may
eventually
become
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
the
--
the
law
or
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
arise
with
the
fact
that
judges
are
trying
to
make
--
are
assuming
a
lot
of
social
policy
on
the
basis
of
evidence
and
experience
which,
with
all
due
respect
to
all
of
us,
they
haven't
got.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
imply
that
the
prostitute
is
always
a
victim
of
the
--
of
the
transport,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
immaterial
to
what?
not
to
the
moral
oversight,
but
to
the
--
you
don't
want
interstate
commerce
use
for
that
purpose,
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
morality
of
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
specific
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
what
congress
has
anything
to
do
with.
that
is
the
peg
on
which
it
hangs
the
facts
that
we
don't
want
interstate
commerce
is
to
mentality
used
for
that
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
making
an
assumption
that
in
the
--
that
it
--
that
it's
perfectly
negligible
that
the
--
the
transportation
of
women
under
the
mann
act
where
the
--
the
woman
is
a
consenting
party,
maybe
even
the
aggressive
party,
that
that's
negligible,
and
the
totality
is
always
a
case
of
victimization
which
would
come
close
to
be
a
lindbergh
act
offense.
if
what
you
say
is
so,
and
you're
almost
within
the
lindbergh
territory,
namely
it
occurs
--
occurs
the
transportation
from
state
to
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if-
if
--
if
--
you
rest
on
a
victim
exception
and
i'm
suggesting
that
that's
making
an
assumption
that
these
mann
act
transportations
are
all
victimizations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
that
predominantly
they
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
but
the
crime
is
the
transportation
and
we've
--
in
several
cases,
in
certainly
one
crucial
case,
the
infliction
of
the
quantity
of
punishment.
one
had
to
examine
what
it
is
really
that
the
mann
act
derives
from,
is
addressed
to,
and
has
its
justifications,
namely
the
misuse
of
transportation
facility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying
that,
i
looked
through
the
period
of
its
passage,
and
no
doubt
congress
may
utilize
the
commerce
clause
where
it's
consequential
denied
and
benevolent
and
desirable
purposes.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
when
you
come
to
invoke
the
rule
of
victim,
you're
making
an
assumption
which
doesn't
apply
--
which
you
reject
in
the
case
put
by
mr.
justice
black.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
did
--
you
did
say
in
his
case,
the
wife
couldn't
--
could
testify,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
connor
have
you
had
an
occasion
to
look
at
the
--
any
reports
of
the
legislative
materials
therein
under
two
statutes
to
which
the
petitioner
refer,
where
congress
was
explicit
in
allowing
the
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
those
statutes,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
--
in
--
under
the
mann
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
those
cases
here
in
particular
excel
she
may
testify
if
she
wants
to,
then
those
courts
commit
themselves
to
the
negative
fragment
of
that
proposition
if
it
doesn't
consent
she
isn't
allowed
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
a
second
circuit

case
u.s.
against
mitchell
at
was
suspiciously
late
page
number
1006,
is
that
a
per
curiam
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
your
answer
means
that
admissibility
would
vary
according
to
the
--
to
the
(inaudible)
or
--
the
foundation
made
for
its
admissibility.
