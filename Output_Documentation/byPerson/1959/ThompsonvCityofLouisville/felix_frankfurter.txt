in
--
on
january
the
10th,
1959,
saturday
afternoon,
the
petitioner
was
shopping
for
vegetables
in
the
louisville
haymarket
and
got
into
an
altercation
with
a
complete
stranger.
they
--
they
--
one
word
let
to
another.
it
ended
up
with
--
with
petitioner
getting
stabbed
in
the
shoulder.
the
man,
his
assailant,
led
off
down
the
street
and
the
petitioner
went
off,
followed
him
on
foot,
not
getting
too
close,
but
keeping
him
in
sight.
they
came
to
first
street,
a
side
street
coming
in.
he
saw
a
police
squad
car
parked
there
and
he
went
up
to
it
and
he
told
the
policeman,
“that
man
stabbed
me.
follow
him
please
and
arrest
him.”
instead,
the
police
arrested
the
petitioner
and
charged
him
with
disorderly
conduct
for
refusing
to
reveal
the
name
of
his
assailant,
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
in
his
life.
on
sunday,
january
the
11th
last
year,
a
year
ago
today,
the
petitioner
retained
my
colleague,
mr.
--
mr.
morse,
as
his
attorney,
to
resist
this
charge.
and
on
the
12th,
he
appeared
in
police
court,
pleaded
not
guilty,
demanded
a
trial
and
the
case
was
set
for
trial
on
january
27th.
everything
which---
which
--
every
--
all
of
--
all
of
the
remaining
incidents
in
this
record
are
the
results
of
reprisals
taken
on
the
petitioner
for
his
boldness
in
be
--
in
--
in
retaining
counsel
and
pleading
not
guilty
and
demanding
a
trial
in
this
--
on
this
ridiculous
disorderly
conduct
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
the
police
knowledge
of
the
petitioner
before
this
episode?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
we
don't
--
do
we
know
whether
the
thompson
before
us
is
the
outlaw
thompson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
things
happened
in
the
past
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
answer
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
you
can
answer,
how
many
--
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
proposition
is
that
this
record
showed
conduct
by
the
police
whereby
whenever
this
man
appears
whether
he
is
treated
--
he
is
treated
as
an
outlaw
and
subjected
to
arrest,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
what
you
say.
so,
i
ask
you
how
many
times
does
this
record
show
he's
himself,
treated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
twice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
proposition
is
not
that
this
conviction
albeit
is
only
for
$10,
that
you
could
come
here
--
you
could
come
here
from
baltimore
mayor's
court,
from
the
lower
--
lowest
court,
your
proposition
is
not
that
this
conviction
is
violated
of
due
process,
because
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
subjected
him
to
this
punishment,
but
that
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
treated
this
as
an
outlaw,
as
a
couple
of
complainants.
is
that
it?
justice

although,
your

show
there
are
only
two
such

this
question.
assume
that
one
takes
your
view
of
the
evidence
just
as
you
present
it,
as
you
stated.
what
i
would
like
to
have
your
views
on
this
is
whether,
under
kentucky
law
--
louisville
ordinance
law,
finding
a
man
in
the
saloon
who
shuffles,
one
doesn't
know
whether
he's
done
it
out
of
exuberance
for
2
minutes
or
for
20
minutes
and
assume
further
that
he
hasn't
bought

does
that
constitute
loitering

vagrancy
under

nd
if
it
does,
if
that's
all
the
evidence
established
there,
is
that
consonant
with
the
fourteenth
amendment?
the
two
questions
i'd
like
you
to
answer.
justice
felix

is
finding
a
man
in
a
saloon
who
happens
to
shuffle
his
feet
with
--
and
hasn't
bought
a
drink
yet,
that
constitutes
loitering
and
vagrancy?
and
that's
what
--
and
that's
the
--
if
that's
the
construction
of
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
might
be
the
ordinance
of
the
statute,
you
think
that
makes
--
that
doesn't
defend
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
all
purposes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
there
is.
if
that's
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
do
that,
would
you
answer
whether
it's
constitutionally
allowable
for
the
city
of
louisville
to
make
it
an
offense
to
be
in
a
barroom
and
to
do
nothing
else
than
to
shuffle,
whatever
that
may
mean
or
you've
said
a
bit
and
not
have
bought
a
drink
or
in
the

does
that
--
that's
made
a
crime.is
that
allowable
under

constitution
of
--
justice
felix

well,
you
can't
say
--
justice
felix

it
can't
be
practically
as
broad
as
that.
justice
felix

you
cant
--
are
you
suggesting
that
merely
before
the
legislative
body,
whether
of
the
state

a
city,
says
something
in
to
be
loitering,
that's
an
end
of
the
matter
and
you
he
can't
inquire
into
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
background
you
give
i
can't
accept,
namely,
that
all
loitering
statutes
and
all
vagrancy
statutes
are
constitutional.
i
should
think
there's
a
great
deal
to
be
--
justice

--
said
to
the
contrary.
justice

so

--
frick,
i
don't

if
an
appeal

could
be
taken

then
you
should
oppose

if

we
haven't

you

you
would
ask
for
a
writ.
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
proceeding
before
your
court
indicated
by
this
petitioner.
justice

but
you
(voice

what
he
did.
justice

frankfurter
he
started
a
--
he
started
habeas
corpus,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he's
got
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
appealed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
suggested
another
difference,
namely,
you
suggested
the
difference
between
a
case
where
a
fellow
appeals
from
the
fine
of
$10,
as
to
which
there's
no
appealability
and
where
he
objects
to
the
fine
on

unconstitutionality.

cases

cases

that
distinction
between
appealability
where
a
constitutional
question
is

and
where
there

do
we

mr.

justice

could
you
do
that?
justice

--
argued
that
this

justice

i
get
your

mr.
lusky's
argument.
he
argued
that
this
is
an
extraordinary

hopes
it
hasn't
arisen
every
day
in
kentucky

case,
we
don't
know
what
they
would
have
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
not
in
a
position
to
argue
otherwise,
unless
there's
--
a
record
has
made
out
such
a
case
--
or
your
brief
has
made
it
out
and
neither
of
which
is
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
haven't
shown
that.
that
isn't
the
case
you're
making.
you
made
this
particular
fellow
as
a
--
as
an
outcast
of
louisville
society.that's
your
argument.
that
was
your
argument
yesterday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
this
will
be
now.
justice

are
you
challenging
the

the
federal
constitutional
validity
of
those
provisions

the
ordinance?
justice

frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
suit
yourself.
i
just
want
to
know
if
you've
challenged
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
challenge
the
total
absence
of
evidence
as
a
foundation
for
assessment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
so
far
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
far
as
we
claim
what
you
make,
you've
just
stated
that
you're
here
challenging
this
judgment?
justice

frankfurter
that
all
we
can
reverse,
whatever
commentary
maybe
made
as
to
the
basis
for
reversal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
can
--
how
can
such
a
stipulation
tell
us
the
basis
of
this
arrest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
we
do
--
tested
and
suggested
that
we
should
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
all
these
arrests
are
as
more
or
less
as
you
claim
this
one
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
would
jump
you
at
the
course
you
take.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
adopting
it,
you're
making
it
part
of
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
wanted
to
address
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
general
assembly
of
kentucky.
justice

you
--
you're
making
a
general
claim.
you
want
us
to
address,
as
i
say,
the
general
assembly
and
the
people
of
kentucky.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
we
can't
just
--
they
have
a
right
to
listen
that
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
(inaudible)
them.
it's
another
thing
to
ask
is
to
make
a
special
address
to
people.
