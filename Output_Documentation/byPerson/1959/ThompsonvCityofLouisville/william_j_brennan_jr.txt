what

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

excuse
me,
mr.
frick.
he
directed
himself
now
to
both
of
the
charges
or
the
separate
charges?
justice
william

the
loitering?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

have
you
--
you
defend
both
convictions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
same
evidence
or
on
different

the
same.

what

what

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
frick,
may
i
declare
what
you
just
answered
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
as
you
said
that
no
basis
for
the
conviction
for
disorderly
conduct
is
relied
upon
as
having
happened
in
the
bar,
is
that
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
only
the
loitering
conviction
that
depends
on
what
happened
in
the
bar.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you're
going
to
go
to
the
disorderly
conduct
charge
as
based
on
what
happened
on
the
sidewalk,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
your
court
knows.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
to
convict
him.
that's
exactly
what
this
case
is
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
frick,
may
i
ask
--
ask
--
mind
what
--
join
with
me
at
the
top
of
page
3.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
those
three
lines,
“went
outside,
he
was
very
argumentative.
he
argued
with
us
back
and
forth
and
so
then,
we
placed
a
disorderly
conduct
charge
on
him.”
is
that
the
whole
basis
of
this
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
those
three
lines?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
there's
nothing
then
to
indicate
his
demeanor
when
he
was
arguing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
know
whether
it
was
boisterous
or
whether
it
was
quiet?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that,
he
might
have
been
discussing
his
arrest
very
quietly
with
the
officers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
it,
or
is
it?
do
you
think
it's
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
an
argument
that's
going
on
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you're
making
an
argument
now,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
--
isn't
this
testimony
compatible
with
his
having
made
the
same
kind
of
argument
with
the
police
officer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
--
mr.
frick,
what
--
tell
me,
what
do
you
understand
that
your
court
meant
in
this
case
by
this
sentence
in
the
opinion
at
page
39?
it
is
only
in
extreme
cases,
like
the
one
at
bar,
where
a
person
wants
to
go
to
the
supreme
court,
i
gather,
that
means
this
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
we
will
interfere
with
an
inferior
court
under
section
110
when
an
unappealable
fine
has
been
imposed?

the

appendix
of

brief.
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
no
objection.
