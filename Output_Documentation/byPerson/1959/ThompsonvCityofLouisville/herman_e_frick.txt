mr.
herman
e.
frick
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
propose
my
remarks
here
with
the
idea
that
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
you
have
a
dispute
between
an
individual
and
organized
society,
sympathy
is
always
for
the
underdog,
the
individual.
but
there's
a
lot
to
be
said
for
society,
too.
after
all,
organized
society
has
the
duty
of
preserving
order.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
constitutional
government
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
ensure
domestic
tranquility.
and
of
course,
one
of
the
ways
of
preserving
order
for
all
of
its
citizens
is
through
these
offenses
and
ordinances
and
statutes
relating
to
loitering,
disorderly
conduct,
vagrancy
and
minor
offenses
of
that
sort.
they
are
designed
to
control
society
to
--
to
prevent
individuals
from
congregating
and
as
a
result
of
idle
minds
stirring
up
crimes,
which
maybe
of
a
serious
nature
and
thereby
injure
society
and
all
of
the
organized
group
as
a
whole.
now,
with
that
theory
in
mind
with
which
i
am
approaching
this
case,
i'd
like
to
get
to
this
point.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
has
been
complicated
by
a
certain
number
of
irrelevancies,
immaterialities
and
some
speculation.
and
i'd
like
to
enumerate
what
i
consider
some
of
those
chief
irrelevances.
first
of
all,
we
have
before
this
court,
a
petition
to
review
the
proceedings
of
a
single
day,
that
is,
the
trial
of
february
the
3rd,
1959,
in
the
louisville
police
court.
the
court
will
have
observed
both
from
the
briefs
and
from
the
argument
that
there's
been
a
great
deal
to
say
about
certain
proceedings
which
happened
in
the
louisville
police
court
on
january
the
20th.
now,
they
may
have
wondered,
as
did
for
some
time
when
i
first
got
into
this
case,
how
that
happened
to
get
into
the
record.
in
the
proceedings
of
february
the
3rd,
an
agreement
was
made
at
page
35
of
the
record
to
stipulate
the
testimony
of
dr.
dean.
that
was
page
34
of
the
record,
i'm
sorry,
which
was
given
at
the
trial
of
january
the
20th.
now,
when
this
stipulation
was
entered
and
it
was
agreed
to
by
the
prosecutor,
mr.
dougherty
and
by
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner,
it
was
then
filed
and
since
that
testimony
was
included
with
the
testimony
of
all
the
proceedings
of
january
the
20th,
the
entire
record
was
filed.
now,
properly
therefore,
before
this
court,
there
is
not
the
proceedings
of
january
the
20th
as
such,
but
only
the
stipulated
testimony
of
dr.
dean.
so
therefore,
after
we
reach
the
first
35
pages
in
the
record
and
the
stipulated
testimony
of
dr.
dean,
the
remainder
is
surplusage.
now
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
that
was
to
this
extent,
an
avowal
was
tendered
in
which
--
prepared
by
mr.
lusky
on
behalf
of
his
client
that
if
he
would
be
allowed
to
testify,
he
would
testify
as
follows.
that
appears,
i
think
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
that
avow,
yes,
sir.
that
of
course,
was
not
allowed
because
in
the
feeling
of
the
trial
judge,
that
was
irrelevant.
that
--
the
issue
he
had
before
him
was
the
offense
which
was
charged
on
february
the
3rd.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
appears
on
the
first
35
pages
of
the
record.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
it's
an
informal
proceeding.
in
other
words,
the
individual
was
arrested
on
february
the
3rd.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
it
came
before
--
it
came
before
the
police
court
in
due
course
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well
[laughs]
the
evidence
--
there
is
no
formal
charge
or
language
that
appears
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
as
such.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
as
far
as
the
police
officer,
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
the
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
arresting
slip
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
is
not
in
this
record,
your
honor
mr.
herman
e.
frick
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
original
record
either,
i
don't
see
it
in
here.
of
course,
we
didn't
prepare
this
record,
but
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
it's
not
with
the
clerk.
it's
down
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
police
court
in
louisville.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
hadn't
thought
of
that
point,
but
i
--
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
i
know
that
he
was
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
and
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
[laughs]
but
i
understand
that
perfectly,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
excuse
me.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
right.
that
is
in
the
possession
of
the
clerk
of
the
police
court.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
it's
just
a
small
slip
of
paper
with
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
it
has
the
abbreviations
for
disorderly
conduct.
he
put
down,
“d.c.”
and
for
loitering,
“loit”
and
then
they
charge
under
this
particular
section
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
that
is
a
ground
for
frequent
objection
in
police
court
that
evidence
is
being
produced
which
is
not
contained
within
the
charge.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
for
loitering?
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
we
have
it
specified
here.
i
don't
recall
offhand.
i
believe
it's
$100.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
$100,
i
believe.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
certainly,
if
the
sentence
imposed
is
$20
or
more,
it
may
be
appealed
as
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
in
other
words,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
right,
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
if
it
has
a
jurisdictional
amount,
it
may
then
be
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir,
if
the
penalty
was
enough.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
deny
is
exactly
the
right
word.
it's
just
a
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
mean
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
we
--
we're
--
i'm
not
trying
to
keep
anything
from
the
court.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
would
like
the
court
to
understand
that.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
but
i
think
both
mr.
lusky
and
i
will
be
willing
to
stipulate
that
he
was
charged
with
loitering
and
disorderly
conduct
by
the
appropriate
slip
of
paper
in
the
louisville
police
court.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
was
an
error
on
my
part.
i
did
not
know
it
was
here.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
i've
had
some
difficulty
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
determining
it
myself,
your
honor.
but
as
i
understand
it,
one
of
the
complaints
made
by
the
petitioner
is
that
he
--
his
client
was
convicted
without
evidence
and
he
had
no
method
of
either
appeal
or
corrective
judicial
review.
now,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
in
my
opinion,
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
i
think
we
will
recite
what
the
evidence
show.
the
evidence
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
they
were
separate
charges,
your
honor,
but
they
were
tried
together
and
the
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
the
loitering
and
the
disorderly
conduct
were
tried
together
and
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony,
the
judge
fixed
a
sentence
of
$10
on
each
offense.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
on
the
same
evidence.
there's
a
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
slight
difference
of
evidence
and
of
course,
in
all
these
cases
for
a
police
court
where
there
are
these
minor
offenses,
not
a
great
deal
of
evidence
is
adduced.
but
briefly,
this
is
what
happened.
on
this
particular
occasion,
there
were
two
police
officers
officer
lacefield
and
officer
barnett.
they
went
into
this
tavern
and
barroom
known
as
the
liberty
inn
café.
under
the
law
of
the
city
of
louisville,
by
ordinance,
a
condition
is
made
before
the
issuance
of
any
license
for
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
that
it
may
be
entered
at
any
time
by
a
police
officer
to
observe
whether
or
not
orderly
conduct
is
being
carried
on,
on
the
premises.
so,
pursuant
to
that
ordinance
and
as
a
routine
check,
these
two
individuals
went
into
the
liberty
inn
café.
when
they
arrived
in
the
liberty
inn
café,
one
officer
testified,
the
only
one
who
testified,
they
went
up
to
the
manager
of
the
premises
and
asked
him
what
that
fellow
was
doing,
pointing
to
sam
thompson.
and
they
asked
him
whether
or
not,
he
had
bought
anything
to
eat
or
drink
while
he
had
been
there.
the
manager
told
them
that
he
had
bought
nothing
to
eat,
nor
drink
and
that
he
had
been
there
about
30
or
35
minutes.
at
this
time,
the
officer
testified,
“sam
thompson
was
standing
in
the
center
of
the
floor
dancing
by
himself,
neither
eating
nor
drinking,
but
merely
dancing.”
and
officer
lacefield
--
incidentally,
mr.
harlan,
the
officer
who
arrested
the
individual
was
mr.
lacefield
who
did
not
know
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
anything
about
the
previous
trouble
that
sam
thompson
has
been
in.
the
other
officer,
mr.
barnett,
told
the
manager
that
he
knew
of
some
trouble
that
he
had
been
in
at
the
bus
station
before.
now,
officer
lacefield,
in
arresting
this
fellow,
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
on
the
premises.
now,
instead
of
saying
that
he
was
there
to
eat
or
drink
anything,
mr.
thompson
said
that
he
was
waiting
for
a
bus.
as
the
officer
testified,
the
liberty
inn
café
faces
on
liberty
street,
which
is
a
one-way
street
going
west.
if
mr.
thompson
wishes
to
catch
a
bus,
he
must
go
out
of
that
building,
go
down
the
street
and
down
to
the
corner
and
catch
a
bus
going
east.
so,
on
that
basis,
apparently,
officer
lacefield
felt
that
there
was
not
a
satisfactory
account
given
by
thompson
and
thereupon,
arrested
him.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
frick,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
of
course,
i
am
not
going
to
tell
anyone
where
he
is
to
wait,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
but
this
is
not
at
the
bus
station.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
and
bear
in
mind
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
five
feet
--
from
five
blocks
or
so
from
a
bus
station.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
think
that
he
could.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
some
time
before,
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
the
case
which
is
before
us
now.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
there
is
another
thing
that
he
--
excuse
me.
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
that's
what
he
[laughter]
--
that's
what
his
attorney
said,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
here's
what
he
could
have
done.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
i
would
say
that
under
the
circumstances,
he
would
not
have
been
within
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
because,
under
our
ordinance
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
under
--
under
our
ordinance,
your
honor
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
it
does
not
forbid
him
there,
but
he
should
be
there
for
the
business
purpose
of
the
proprietor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
and
he
was
not
there
on
a
business
purpose
of
the
proprietor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
he
was
there
loitering.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well
[laughs]
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
the
--
the
business
is
and
under
this
loitering
ordinance,
an
order
to
preserve
peace,
he
realize
that
people
loiter,
that
they
will
--
but
idle
minds
think
of
mischief,
which
will
cause
damage
to
society.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
is
the
point
that
we're
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
now
that
gets
to
the
other
point.
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
whittaker's
question
first
and
then
come
to
you.
insofar
as
where
he
could
have
waited,
your
honor,
he
could
have
waited
at
the
bus
stop
itself,
where
he
said
he
would
--
intended
to
catch
the
bus
which
was
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well
[laughs]
a
number
of
people
have
waited
on
cold
nights,
your
honor,
for
a
bus.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
very
dramatic,
your
honor,
but
i
plead
what
[laughter]
--
that
what
actually
happened,
not
that
he
was
tapping
his
foot.
we
have
to
bear
this
in
mind,
that
where
there
is
a
conflict
in
evidence,
your
honor,
and
there
has
been
a
conviction,
that
conviction
must
be
supported.
now,
the
officer
testified
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
evidence,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
the
evidence
--
there
was
evidence
that
he
was
dancing,
evidence
of
the
arresting
officer
and
ultimately,
evidence
of
the
manager
of
the
barroom.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
on
cross-examination,
he
was
asked
whether
or
not,
the
fellow
was
doing
a
shuffle
dance
and
he
answered,
“yes
that
he
was.”
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir,
but
i
believe
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
he
also
went
further.
i
believe
he
admitted
that
it
was
a
shuffle
dance.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
don't
know
exactly
where
that
is
right
here
in
the
testimony.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
on
page
27,
but
mr.
--
question,
“but
mr.
thompson
was
dancing?”
answer,
“he
was
shuffling
around.”
question,
“doing
a
kind
of
shuffle
dance?”
answer,
“yes.”
that's
the
testimony
of
the
manager
of
the
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
doing
a
shuffle
dance.
now
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
your
honor,
i
--
i
presume
it
is
[laughter]
some
form
of
dancing
which
he
uses
a
system
of
shuffling.
now,
i
was
not
present
[laughter]
--
i
was
not
present,
of
course
and
i
can't
demonstrate
to
the
court
what
was
involved.
apparently
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
shuffling
is
not
illegal
in
louisville.
what
is
illegal,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
is
dancing
in
the
premises
licensed
to
sell
liquor.
now,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
person
who
dances
is
committing
a
crime,
but
merely
that
the
holder
of
the
license
is
forbidden
to
permit
dancing
on
his
premises.
in
other
words,
a
license
holder
is
the
one
who
violates
that
particular
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
we
do
not
have
a
license
holder
before
us,
but
that
demonstrates
why
this
probably
was
not
the
type
of
business
for
which
the
operator
of
the
tavern
invited
the
public
to
attend
on
his
premises.
he
certainly
would
not
invite
them
to
attend
if,
by
so
doing,
he
would
jeopardize
his
license.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
he
said
that
he
had
no
objection
to
his
being
there.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
but
he
did
say
further
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
he
did
not
say
that
he
was
doing
anything
objectionable
to
him
in
the
record.
what
he
did
say
was
that
he
would
object
to
dancing,
if
there
were
dancing
because
of
course,
that
would
forfeit
his
license.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
or
words
to
that
effect,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
he
said
this,
“when
the
--
the
police
testified
that
when
he
came
in,
that
he
had
neither
bought
anything
to
--
neither
anything
to
eat
nor
drink.”
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
on
direct
examination
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
at
the
trial,
he
said
--
he
--
this
is
what
he
said
positively.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
he
said
that
he
did
not
know
whether
he
had
bought
anything
to
eat
or
drink.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
and
he
could've
--
that
he
could've
bought
something.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
what
--
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may
tell
you
what
i
said
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
said,
when
the
police
officer
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
on
--
now,
this
is
at
the
time
of
the
officer's
testimony
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
on
page
2,
your
honor,
testimony
of
officer
william
lacefield.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
your
honor
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
your
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
all
right.
now,
let
me
make
this
point.
your
honor,
i'm
telling
you
what
officer
lacefield
said
at
the
time
when
he
testified
as
to
the
arrest.
on
this
question,
he
said,
“i
walked
over
and
asked
the
bartender
if
he
had
bought
anything
in
there
and
how
long
he
had
been
there
and
he
told
us
that
he
had
been
there
a
little
over
a
half
hour
and
that
he
had
not
bought
anything.”
all
right,
now,
that's
what
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
that's
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
is
hearsay.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
on
the
testimony
of
william
marks
(ph)
at
the
trial
at
--
that's
on
page
28,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
you
do
know
this
question,
“you
do
know
this
fellow,
thompson,
had
been
there
for
half
an
hour
and
had
not
eaten
anything?”
answer,
“i
didn't
see
him
eat
anything.”
question,
“if
he
had
had
anything
to
eat
or
to
drink,
you
would
have
known
about
it.”
answer,
“it
seems
like
i
would.”
question,
“because
you
were
there
all
the
time?”
answer,
“yes.”
now
later
on,
what
your
honor
is
referring
to,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
“but
you
never
saw
him
buy
anything.”
answer,
“no.
that
don't
mean
he
didn't
buy
anything.
he
was
standing
out
there
on
the
floor.”
that
is
the
part
to
which
your
honor
is
referring
to.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
that
is
--
that
is
true,
but
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
the
point
that
i
was
making
was
that
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
the
point
that
i
was
making
that
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
according
to
lacefield,
the
arresting
officer,
he
was
informed
by
the
manager
that
he
had
not
bought
anything
to
eat
or
drink.
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
to
your
honor.
and
if
i
didn't
do
that,
i
apologize
to
the
court.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
i
think,
briefly
and
this
particular
case
has
demonstrated.
it
was
so
held
to
constitute
loitering
under
the
ordinance.
the
ordinance
provided
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
think
it
--
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
this
is
an
ordinance
rather
than
a
statute
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
ordinance
of
the
city
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
believe
that
--
that
the
facts
is
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
all
--
that's
all
there
is
as
far
as
the
loitering
charge.
as
far
as
the
disorderly
conduct
charge
is
concerned,
that
was
another
piece
of
evidence
(voice
overlap)
which
i'd
like
to
tell
the
court.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
the
disorderly
conduct
evidence
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
is
--
with
this
background,
that
loitering
ordinances
and
statutes
are
recognized
to
be
an
--
constitutional
exercise
of
power.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
i
don't
say
that
at
all,
your
honor,
but
i'm
just
giving
that
background.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
the
next
point
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
i
think
your
honor
is
quite
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
the
question
is
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
think,
under
certain
circumstances,
he
might.
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
facts
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
that's
true,
but
now,
you
make
this
distinction.
if
those
women
are
in
there
for
the
business
purpose
of
the
store,
namely,
to
shop
or
to
--
or
to
apprise
themselves
the
prices
for
the
object
of
future
purposes,
that
would
be
a
different
situation.
but
where
the
person
would
go
into
a
store
with
not
the
single
desire
or
purpose
ever
to
indulge
in
business
with
that
proprietor
of
those
premises
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
ever
as
long
as
they
live
or
at
any
time
at
all
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
that
could
constitute
loitering.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
but
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
this.
that
it's
a
concept
that
--
that
a
business
operator
invites
the
public
for
his
business
purpose.
now,
the
business
purpose
of
this
barroom
was
to
sell
food
and
to
sell
drink.
the
business
purpose
is
not
to
provide
a
place
to
wait
for
a
bus,
nor
is
it,
quite
clearly,
a
place
where
one
may
dance.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
but
he
is
there
upon
the
expressed
permission
of
the
proprietor
or
by
--
on
the
implied
permission,
i
think
he
is
there
properly.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
your
honor,
i
have
expressed
my
opinion,
namely,
that
the
implied
indication
was
only
for
the
purpose
of
the
business.
now,
the
fact
that
there
are
a
crowd
of
people
there
and
there
was
no
objection
by
the
proprietor
or
the
operator
of
the
premises,
i
think
is
evidence
which
should
be
considered.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
but
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
suppose
that's
quite
true,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
to
--
to
get
back
to
the
evidence,
there's
very
little
evidence
of
disorderly
conduct.
it's
contained
in
the
record
that,
when
he
is
--
that
when
sam
thompson
was
taken
outside
the
barroom,
he
argued
back
and
forth
with
the
policeman
and
thereupon,
they
placed
the
disorderly
conduct
charge
against
him.
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
the
evidence
which
relates
to
the
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
presume
so.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
correct.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
to
the
extent
of
it,
i
don't
know.
the
testimony
is
very
sketchy
on
that
part.
it
was
just
that
he
argued
back
and
forth
with
the
arresting
officer
and
on
that
basis
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
to
get
back
to
these
offenses
again,
i
don't
think
it's
the
greatest
evidence
in
the
world,
but
i
think
it
is
sufficient
evidence
of
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
in
other
words
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
to
create
a
disturbance
on
the
streets.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
think
that
evidence
of
argument
which
results
in
public
disorder
is
sufficient
evidence.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
question.
i
think
that
the
first
thing
to
do
would
be
just
to
read
this
part
of
the
record
which
relates
to
it.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
is
correct.
i
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
will
--
i
will
say
that
that's
what
the
evidence
shows,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
and
not
--
not
as
all
that
shows
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
in
connection
with
the
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
to
arrest
him
for
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
of
disorderly
conduct,
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
those
three
lines,
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
we
know
no
more
than
what
is
contained
in
those
three
lines,
from
one
line
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
and
the
three
lines
at
the
top
of
page
3.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
if
--
if
that
is
compatible
with
the
idea
of
argument.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
--
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
compatible.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
idea
of
argumentativeness
might
be
loud
and
--
and
normally
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
(voice
overlap)
but
there
is
--
there's
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
it
was
loud
argument
or
quiet
argument
or
any
other
kind
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
hope
so,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
suppose
so,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
i
believe
his
testimony
was
to
that
effect.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
don't
remember.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
vagrancy,
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
that's
a
colloquial
or
abbreviation
of
the
crime
of
vagrancy.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
there
was
no
argument.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
there
was
no
argument.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
there
could
have
been.
under
section
110
of
our
constitution
which
is
the
one
that
gives
to
our
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
over
inferior
courts.
now,
as
mentioned
by
my
opponent,
mr.
lusky,
the
kentucky
cases
are
to
the
effect
that
the
mere
monetary
amount
is
insufficient
to
confer
jurisdiction
under
section
110
on
our
court
of
appeals,
because
that
would
amount
to
a
substitute
for
an
appeal.
but
all
of
these
cases,
like
fowler
and
also
in
this
particular
case
here,
say
that
where
there
is
a
great
and
irreparable
injury
that
then,
an
application
may
be
made
to
section
110
of
the
kentucky
constitution.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
an
appeal
could
not
have
been
taken.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
an
appeal
as
such
could
not
have
been
taken.
i
believe
that
an
application
could
have
been
made
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
under
section
110,
the
right
to
control
an
--
inferior
courts
setting
forth
this
alleged
gigantic
conspiracy
between
the
louisville
police
judge
and
the
louisville
police
force.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
and
that
would
have
been
such
a
great
mere
reparable
injury
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
would
have
taken
jurisdiction.
now,
let
me
point
out
one
more
thing
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
believe
that
it
could
have,
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
under
section
110
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
on
the
constitution.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
shall
i
take
one
minute
for
that,
your
honor?
mr.
herman
e.
frick
all
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
here's
the
situation.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
here's
a
situation.
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
applied
for
to
our
circuit
court
to
stay
the
execution
of
the
sentence
of
this
police
court
pending
its
review
by
this
court.
it
was
issued
by
the
circuit
court.
the
city
of
louisville
objected
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
such
jurisdiction
under
our
law.
it
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
this
is
a
collateral
proceeding
on
habeas
corpus
and
on
this
collateral
proceeding,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
circuit
judge
on
a
habeas
question
--
habeas
corpus
question,
saying
that
it
alone
had
jurisdiction
under
section
110
and
said
further,
recognizing
this
fact
that
in
a
$5
or
$10
appeal
as
such,
there
was
no
review
and
therefore,
the
only
remedy
was
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
they
say
further,
they
--
by
dicta,
they
set
out
this
other
idea
that
if
there
is
a
great
and
irreparable
injury,
this
court
will
take
jurisdiction.
they
also
recite
that
this
was
an
extreme
case.
now,
i
believe
that
--
without
speculating,
what
a
court
would
have
done.
that
in
this
collateral
proceeding,
if
they
felt
that
that
was
sufficient
under
section
110
to
take
jurisdiction
and
on
their
own
motion,
order
a
stay
of
proceedings
in
the
louisville
police
court
so
that
they
might
go
to
this
court.
that
that
court
likewise,
if
they
consider
this
case
as
important,
would
have
the
authority
when
the
principal
case
and
on
the
merits,
comes
before
to
taking
grant
relief.
now,
that
is
my
position,
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
never
given
an
opportunity
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
as
such
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
it's
argued
some
places
in
my
brief.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
don't
remember
exactly
where.
i'd
like
to
make
just
one
more
point.
now,
as
far
as
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
is
concerned,
this
is
direct
from
the
louisville
police
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
has
not
been
asked
to
grant
relief
to
this
petitioner
on
any
violations
of
constitutional
rights.
now,
he
has
constitutional
rights
both
under
the
federal
constitution
and
under
our
state
constitution.
they
had
never
been
asked
to
do
that,
so,
i
don't
see
how
that
you
can
complain
about
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
when
they
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
merits
of
this
question,
but
only
on
the
collateral
point
which
they
considered
important
enough
to
grant
relief
on
their
own
motion.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
don't
know
what
you
can
say
unless
the
question
is
presented
to
a
court.
bear
in
mind,
this
is
a
collateral
proceeding.
under
section
110,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
grants
relief
on
its
own
motion.
they
grant
a
stay
of
proceedings
without
being
asked
for
to
the
petitioner.
now,
if
they
have
that
authority
and
deem
it
important
enough
in
a
collateral
manner,
they
certainly
have
authority
in
the
principal
matter
to
consider
it
important
enough.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
believe
i
raised
it.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
didn't
make
any
specific
claim
as
such.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
was
talking
about
the
right
of
--
right
of
review.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
is
there
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
the
only
way
that
i
can
ask,
it
may
--
we
may
or
may
not
have
jurisdiction
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
i'd
like
for
the
court
to
understand
that,
that
it
is
discretionary
under
section
110,
whether
or
not,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
will
review.
now,
they
have
said
that
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
simple
fine
of
$5
or
$10,
they
will
not
grant
relief
under
section
110.
but,
where
a
great
and
irreparable
injury
is
done,
then
they
will
grant
relief
under
section
110.
so,
mr.
frankfurter
--
judge
frankfurter,
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
your
question
whether
there
is
or
is
not
an
appeal.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
it's
speculation.
that's
why
i've
started
off
by
saying
that
there
was
speculation
in
this
case.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
they
were
not
asked.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
as
such.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
they
did
on
the
collateral
point,
that
is,
a
stay
of
proceedings.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
on
the
basis
of
section
110,
they
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
say
that
we
have
a
power
under
section
110
of
the
kentucky
constitution
over
control
of
the
inferior
courts
to
grant
this
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
maybe
they
could.
i
don't
know.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
they
said
that
in
the
collateral
proceeding.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
but
now,
they
were
not
asked
for
relief
on
the
other
point.
now,
there
may
or
may
not
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
right.
on
their
own
--
on
the
court's
own
motion
that
granted
the
stay
of
proceeding
in
the
collateral
case.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
initiated
by
the
city
of
louisville.
we
appealed
in
the
collateral.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
we
appealed.
then
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
then,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
opinion
which
is
attached
to
this
--
an
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
says
that
we
have
the
power.
we
will
not
require
the
petitioner
to
file
a
new
application
with
us
under
110,
when
we
will
grant
the
relief
anyhow.
so,
we
will
hereby
authorize
a
stay
of
proceedings,
which
was
not
asked
for
by
the
petitioner
in
the
appeal.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
has
been
construed
for
such
writs
as
writs
of
prohibition
to
present
--
to
prevent
great
and
irreparable
injury.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
there
isn't
--
there
is
another
case
which
says
that
where
a
constitutional
right
may
be
involved,
i
think
it's
the
fowler
case,
where
a
constitutional
right
may
be
involved
but
the
fine
is
only
$5
or
$10
and
there's
no
other
showing
of
great
or
irreparable
injury,
relief
will
not
be
granted.
that's
the
reverse
of
the
situation.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
--
that's
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief,
fowler
versus
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
what
is
it?
mr.
herman
e.
frick
walters
against
fowler.
but
now,
in
that
particular
case,
there
was
no
showing
of
this
gigantic
conspiracy
which
we
have
in
this
case
which
may
make
a
difference.
we're
--
we're
asked
to
speculate
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
do.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
this
walters
versus
fowler
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
your
honor,
in
this
walters
versus
fowler,
i'd
like
to
be
fair
about
this.
in
walters
versus
fowler,
there
was
a
$5
fine,
i
believe,
and
a
question
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
imposition
of
the
fine.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
under
section
110,
refused
to
take
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
this
was
just
a
minor
fine
and
there
was
no
showing
of
great
and
irreparable
injury.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that
was
the
language
which
i
was
mentioning.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
was
in
the
mind
of
our
court
of
appeals,
but
they
say
extreme
cases
and
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
this
was
considered
an
extreme
case
on
the
collateral
proceedings,
sufficient
for
them
to
grant
relief.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
don't
attempt
to
forecast
what
the
court
would
do.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
here
is
a
case
--
this
very
case
itself
on
collateral
proceedings
where
they
did
entertain
jurisdiction
under
section
110
voluntarily.
now,
if
an
application
will
be
made
on
the
merits,
would
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
be
different
from
the
facts
--
sufficiently
different
from
the
facts
in
walters
versus
fowler,
that
they
would
take
jurisdiction?
that
is
the
question.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
well,
i
believe
that
can
very
well
be
argued,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
do
argue
it.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
would
like
to
put
it
this
way.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
not
as
such,
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
let
me
tell
you
why
we
did
that.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
now,
it's
in
my
brief.
on
--
the
record
in
the
trial
of
this
case
on
february
the
3rd,
the
record
shows
that
on
page
31,
that
the
record
was
shown
to
the
police
court.
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
this
court
is
entitled
to
the
same
evidence
which
a
police
court
was
shown.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
it
showed
54
arrests.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
we
showed
nine
arrests,
that
is
for
the
period
of
the
one
year
preceding
the
arrest.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
i
--
the
other
arrests
are
not
material.
there
is
no
point
in
cluttering
up
the
record
with
that.
the
arrests
in
the
year
preceding
are
admissible
because,
under
our
alcoholic
beverage
statute,
it
is
illegal
for
the
holder
of
an
alcoholic
beverage
license
to
sell
liquor
to
someone
who
has
been
convicted
three
times
in
the
previous
year,
three
times
or
more
of
drunkenness
in
a
public
place.
that's
what
dpp
is.
now
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
not
as
such.
the
--
the
criminal
record
of
this
man
of
54
arrests
was
shown
to
the
police
court
and
the
judge,
at
page
31,
said,
“let
the
record
show
that
the
prosecutor
showed
me
this
record.”
the
basis
is
not
important.
it's
just
to
show
that
there
was
some
jeopardy
of
the
license
holder
if
he
would
want
to
sell
beer
to
mr.
thompson
who
claimed
that
he
bought
a
bottle
of
beer
on
the
premises.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
understand
that
he
has.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
12
times.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
12,
mr.
lusky
says.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
this,
your
honor.
mr.
lusky
would
have
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i'd
be
willing
to
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i'd
be
--
i'd
be
willing
to
stipulate
that
the
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
--
list
of
subsequent
arrests
may
be
given
to
the
court
for
full
information.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
hope
not,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
have
to
--
we've
got
into
some
other
irrelevance
either.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
it's
on
page
38.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
that's
--
i
said
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
law,
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
have
jurisdiction
under
section
110
in
an
extreme
case.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
it
--
it
has
never
taken
one
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
they
have
taken
--
i
do
recall
of
another
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
did
take
jurisdiction
under
section
110,
which
was
not
on
a
constitutional
case,
but
which
was
one
which
was
not
otherwise
authorized
by
a
statute.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
that
is
not
cited.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
i
--
i
can
find
it
in
--
i
suppose,
forward
to
the
clerk.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
all
right.
mr.
herman
e.
frick
unfortunately
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
no,
sir.
that
is
not
what
i
--
the
case
that
i
had
in
mind.
the
case
that
i
had
in
mind
was
one,
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
where
there
was
a
provision
for
the
incorporation
of
a
city
where
there
was
no
right
of
appeal
and
a
constitutional
question
was
raised
and
the
court
of
appeals
granted
an
appeal
either
directly
or
under
(inaudible)
or
go
with
saying
on
a
constitutional
point,
that
always
(inaudible)
that
is
the
case,
it's
miller
--
mr.
herman
e.
frick
(voice
overlap)
versus
miller.
