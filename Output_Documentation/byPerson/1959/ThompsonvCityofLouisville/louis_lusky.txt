mr.
louis
lusky
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
for
review,
two
judgments
of
the
police
court
of
louisville,
adjudicating
the
petitioner
to
be
guilty
of
violating
two
city
of
louisville
ordinances.
these
ordinances
proscribe
--
prescribe
penalties
--
criminal
penalties
for
loitering
and
disorderly
conduct.
the
case
comes
here
directly
from
the
police
court
of
louisville,
because
it
happens
that
that
is
the
highest
court
of
kentucky
and
which
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
case
can
be
held.
the
reason
--
mr.
louis
lusky
that
is
clear
and
undisputed.
mr.
louis
lusky
there
is
no
intermediate
court
of
appeals
in
kentucky
at
all,
mr.
justice.
and
the
exact
statutory
situation
is
that
judgments
of
the
police
court
of
louisville
are
not
appealable
unless
they
involve
a
fine
of
at
least
$20
or
a
jail
sentence
of
more
than
10
days,
or
both.
it
is
also
clear,
under
the
kentucky
decisions,
that
even
the
extraordinary
power
possessed
by
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
to
exercise
control
over
inferior
jurisdictions
under
section
110
of
the
kentucky
constitution,
which
is
a
kind
of
an
all
writs
section,
that
even
this
power
is
not
available
despite
the
existence
of
timely
and
substantial
federal
constitutional
claims
where,
as
in
this
case,
the
sentence
is
unappealable
because
of
its
smallness.
in
other
words,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
has
squarely
held
that
where
a
$10
fine
is
involved
and
where
the
fine
is
unappealable
on
the
merits
because
it
is
so
small,
that
the
court
of
appeals
will
consider
the
injustice
to
be
too
small
to
justify
the
invocation
of
relief
under
the
all
writs
act.
the
cases
for
that
are
cited
in
our
brief,
walters
against
fowler,
thompson
against
wood.
and
actually,
a
proceeding
collateral
to
this
case
and
which
it
was
also
reaffirmed,
which
i
will
describe
if
you'd
like
to
hear
it
now.
it's
--
i
mean,
our
--
we
had
a
problem
on
this
case
in
--
in
this
rather
peculiar
way.
it
was
clear
enough
that
this
was
the
--
that
--
that
since
these
cases
were
--
involved
sentences
too
small
to
take
any
kentucky
court,
this
was
the
only
court
that
they
could
be
taken
to.but
it
was
also
unfortunately
true
that
under
kentucky
law,
there
is
no
provision
for
bail,
unless
you
are
taking
an
appeal
to
a
state
court,
no
statutory
provisions
for
bail.
third,
it
was
true
under
kentucky
law
that
there
was
--
that
--
that
whether
you
want
to
or
not,
if
you're
put
in
the
louisville
workhouse
in
default
of
paying
a
fine,
you
automatically
get
credit
on
your
fine
at
the
rate
of
$2
a
day
for
everyday
you
spend
in
the
workhouse.
this
petitioner
has
two
$10
fines
and
that
meant
that
--
that
at
the
end
of
10
days,
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not,
he
would've
paid
those
fines
by
being
in
the
workhouse
for
10
days
and
the
case
would
be
moot.
so,
for
that
reason,
desiring
to
file
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
knowing
that
this
court
--
it's
hard
even
to
write
a
petition
for
--
in
10
days,
much
less
get
it
ruled
on.
we
had
to
initiate
collateral
proceedings
in
order
to
get
him
out
of
jail,
long
enough
so
that
we
could
get
a
petition
for
certiorari
filed
here
and
we
--
we
did
file
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
state
circuit
court.
habeas
corpus
was
granted
on
constitutional
grounds.
there
was
no
statutory
provision
for
it,
but
judge
lawrence
grauman
of
the
jefferson
circuit
court
held
that
if
he
had
a
federal
constitutional
claim
and
a
substantial
one
which
he
--
which
judge
grauman
thought
he
did,
that
he
had
an
ancillary
right
to
have
that
--
to
have
an
opportunity
to
present
that
claim
without
having
his
case
become
moot,
before
he
could
possibly
get
it
up
here.
and
since
the
only
way
to
do
that
was
to
grant
him
his
liberty
on
--
on
reasonable
bail,
by
a
fix
bail
in
the
amount
of
$35
and
let
him
out.
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
if
your
honor
please.
in
the
first
case,
if
you
--
and
i
--
i
see
you
have
studied
the
record
already.
mr.
louis
lusky
you
will
see
that
the
--
that
the
police
court
judge
offered
an
appealable
sentence.
he
gave
the
defendant
an
option.
what
he
said
in
the
first
case
was,
“my
inclination,”
he
says,
“is”--
on
the
--
in
--
in
the
first
case,
there
were
two
charges
also,
one
loitering
and
one
vagrancy.
he
said,
“my
inclination
is
to
fine
you
$10
on
the
loitering
and
to
file
away
the
vagrancy
charge.”
this
was
about
the
mildest
thing
he
could
do.
and
--
and
of
course
--
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
that's
--
that's
an
interesting
thing
that
--
and
maybe
it's
peculiar
to
kentucky.
you
see
under
kentucky
law,
you
can't
sue
a
police
officer
for
wrongful
arrest,
if
the
criminal
case
is
not
terminated
in
your
favor
first.
now,
this
is
quite
a
standard
rule
of
private
law
as
far
as
malicious
prosecution
is
concerned.
it
is
rather
--
it
is
not
a
standard
rule
of
private
law
in
false
imprisonment
cases.
most
states
hold
that
where
your
action
is
for
false
imprisonment
for
a
summary
arrest,
you
can
test
the
legality
of
the
rest
--
of
the
arrest
quite
independently
of
the
--
of
the
legality
of
--
of
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
criminal
prosecution,
but
kentucky
says
otherwise.
in
kentucky,
if
you
--
if
you
don't
win
the
criminal
case,
you
--
you're
out
of
court
on
your
false
imprisonment
as
well.
now,
when
a
police
court
judge
is
faced
within
kentucky,
with
the
problem
--
with
a
situation
where
on
the
one
hand,
he
doesn't
really
think
the
defendant
is
deserving
of
punishment
but
on
the
other
hand,
he
doesn't
want
to
make
it
possible
for
a
defendant
to
sue
a
police
officer
for
wrongful
arrest.
it
is
the
common
thing
for
the
police
court
to
say,
“we
will
file
this
case
away.”
which
means
it
is
in
a
state
of
indefinite
suspended
animation.
mr.
louis
lusky
what
is
it?
no,
it's
on
--
it's
--
it's
technically
subject
to
being
reopened
on
notice
by
the
prosecution
or
by
the
defendant.
and
if
it
is
so
reopened,
then
it's
tried
like
any
other
case.
in
--
in
practically
every
case,
it
is
--
it
just
goes
to
sleep.
it
has
a
residual
effect.
future
employers
can
see
that
it's
an
unresolved
case
and
if
they
don't--
if
they're
out
of
state
employers
and
don't
know
how
we
do
things
in
kentucky
exactly,
why
they
make
it
--
draw
the
wrong
conclusion.
it
--
it
may
have
an
effect
possibly
on
the
judge
in
a
later
case,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
the
case
is
finished
except
for
purposes
of
a
malicious
prosecution
action.
now,
two
or
three
years
ago,
in
the
case
of
van
arsdale
against
caswell
and
after
it
was
made
to
get
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
to
recognize
that
--
that
the
case
really
was
over
when
it
was
filed
away.
and
therefore,
that
a
malicious
prosecution
action
should
be
possible
and
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
said,
“no,
we
don't
think
that's
so.”
it
is
still
open,
but
you
must
remember
that
a
case
can
be
filed
away
without
the
defendant's
consent.
now,
they
said
also,
“is
that
if
the
defendant
asks
to
have
the
case
heard
and
the
court
files
it
away
nevertheless,
that
is
a
final
termination
from
which
he
can
appeal.”
so
in
this
case,
on
the
--
on
the
january
20th
hearing
when
they
asked
us
if
we
wouldn't
like
to
have
the
$10
fine
on
the
loitering
and
the
vagrancy
filed
away,
what
actually
happened?
we
first
said,
“no,
we
would
not
like
a
$10
fine
on
the
loitering.
if
you're
willing
to
give
us
a
$20
fine,
we'd
like
it
better
than
--
than
a
$10.”
and
so,
that's
what
we
got.
then
he
said,
“we'll
file
away
the
vagrancy.”
and
i
said
“no,
your
honor,
i'd
prefer
it
if
you
would
please
dismiss
the
vagrancy.”
obviously,
if
--
if
the
court
had
considered
the
defendant
to
be
guilty
of
vagrancy,
he
would
have
to
right
to
file
away
the
case,
it
would've
been
his
duty
to
find
him
guilty.
so,
we
said
under
van
arsdale
against
caswell,
we
have
a
right
to
have
it
--
to
have
it
adjudicated
and
the
decision
should
be
a
dismissal,
we
submit.
without
hearing
any
further
evidence
or
argument,
the
court
said,
“in
that
event,
the
question
is
do
you
want
an
appealable
sentence
or
not?”
and
we
said,
“we
prefer
to
have
none,
but
if
it's
going
to
be
a
sentence,
we
prefer
an
appealable
sentence.”
and
he
said,
“well,
you
can
either
have
a
$10
fine
which
is
the
maximum
fine
that
the
statute
authorizes
or
a
30-day
jail
sentence
which
is
the
minimum
jail
sentence.”
and
we
took
the
minimum
jail
sentence
and
we
appealed.
and
in
march
--
march
18th,
the
case
was
heard
before
a
jury
in
a
circuit
court
and
resulted
in
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
in
that
case,
your
honor,
we
were
offered
this
opportunity.
in
the
case
from
which
we
are
now
seeking
relief
--
the
judgments
from
which
we
are
now
seeking
relief,
we
were
not
offered
that
opportunity.
mr.
louis
lusky
same
defendant.
mr.
louis
lusky
different
arrests,
different
alleged
offenses.
mr.
louis
lusky
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
lusky
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
--
there's
a
general
practice.
i
mean,
i
think
the
general
practice
of
defense
counsel
is
probably
not
to
ask
the
court
for
any
heavier
sentences
than
--
than
it's
inclined
to
impose.
if
the
court
offers
a
clear
choice,
i
think
it's
up
to
the
client
to
decide
whether
he
wants
to
have
an
appealable
sentence.
in
this
case,
we
did
not
ask
the
court
to
punish
the
defendant
harder
than
the
court
was
inclined
to
do
it.
mr.
louis
lusky
they
are,
your
honor.
under
kentucky
police
statutes,
police
judge
--
police
court
judges
in
cities
of
the
first-class
have
to
be
members
of
the
bar
for
at
least
eight
years
and
this
is
not
true,
i
think,
in
some
of
the
country
courts,
but
it
is
true
in
louisville,
which
is
the
only
city
of
the
first-class.
mr.
louis
lusky
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
lusky
a
further
appeal
if
the
jurisdictional
requirements
for
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals
are
satisfied.
i
think
it
has
to
be
at
least
a
$50
fine,
at
least
as
some
higher
--
some
higher.
mr.
louis
lusky
but
in
circuit
court,
of
course,
you
have
a
jury
and
--
and
you
also
have
a
--
a
somewhat
different
mode
of
proceeding.
mr.
louis
lusky
on
the
first
point
in
the
briefs?
mr.
louis
lusky
well
--
mr.
louis
lusky
there
are
--
there
are,
your
honor.
there
are
two
or
three.
actually,
in
my
--
let
me
--
let
me
say
this.
it
is
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
separate
these
issues,
these
constitutional
issues.
they're
all
due
process
questions.
it's
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
separate
them
out
into
separate
categories.
we
have
done
this
for
purposes
of
--
of
presentation
in
the
brief.
actually,
i
think
you
can
state
the
petitioner's
problem
and
his
constitutional
claim
very
simply.
his
problem
is
that
he
has
been
subjected
--
he
has
been
reduced
to
a
virtual
status
of
outlawry
by
the
action
of
the
louisville
police
in
arresting
him
whenever
they
see
him,
no
matter
what
he's
doing
or
not
doing.
that
--
and
this
incidentally,
is
something
which
started
and
which
the
record
shows
is
the
result
of
a
very
bold
and
brash
thing
which
the
petitioner
did
a
year
ago
tomorrow.
and
i
--
i
might
just
a
well
tell
you
this
specifically,
because
it
does
underlie
the
whole
thing.
on
january
the
--
mr.
louis
lusky
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
lusky
the
petitioner,
your
honor,
had
an
arrest
record.
it
is
not
clear
to
me,
and
i
don't
think
it's
clear
to
anybody
on
this
record,
just
how
many
times
he
had
been
arrested.
the
--
and
--
and
the
reason
is
rather
interesting.
the
record
--
the
--
the
arrest
record
as
such,
was
never
introduced
in
evidence.
it
was
offered
at
the
january
20th
trial
and
was
rejected
after
it
was
brought
out
on
cross-examination
that
--
that
there
were
two
sam
thompsons,
one
of
them
20
years
or
so
older
than
the
other
and
they
had
them
both
in
there,
you
see.
and
at
the
second
trial,
the
--
the
arrest
record
which
is
not
a
public
record
incidentally,
i
mean,
if
--
if
any
--
if
a
man
on
the
street
were
to
walk
into
the
police
department
and
asked
to
see
it,
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
see
it.
this
record
was
not
offered
in
evidence
at
the
second
trial,
but
the
record
shows
it
was
handed
up
to
the
judge
before
sentence,
because
he
stated
before
imposing
sentence
in
the
second
case,
that
he
had
been
shown
a
--
a
record
that
the
petitioner
had
been
arrested
54
times
before
that.
it
didn't
show
how
many
convictions
there
were
and
it
didn't
show
how
many
of
them
were
--
involved
this
sam
thompson.
and
so,
i
don't
know.
i
never
saw
mr.
thompson
until
a
year
ago.
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
we
--
we
know,
but
he
is
the
one
that
the
things
that
have
happened
in
the
past
year
have
happened
to.
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
your
honor,
i
--
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
couple
of
minutes
to
--
to
review
them
--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
quite
quickly
and
then
i
would
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
could.
mr.
louis
lusky
how
many
things?
mr.
louis
lusky
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
lusky
this
record
shows
twice.
mr.
louis
lusky
the
first
time
we
were
given
an
option
of
taking
appealable
sentence
was
we
appealed,
we
got
them
reversed.
incidentally,
the
first
charge,
the
cutting
disorderly
conduct
was
filed
away
and
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
have
resist
the
filing
away.
we
had
our
hands
full.
the
--
the
case
was
filed
away
and
--
and
that's
the
end
of
that.
we
appealed
the
second
conviction
which
took
place
on
january
20th
and
on
march
18th,
we
got
it
reversed
on
the
directed
acquittal
in
circuit
court,
after
jury
trial.
mr.
louis
lusky
well
--
mr.
louis
lusky
there's
a
little
more
than
that.
mr.
louis
lusky
now,
that
is
not
quite
what
the
record
shows,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
lusky
what
the
record
shows
is
that
there
were
two
arresting
--
i
--
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
answer
both
these
points.
but
let
me
just
say
quickly,
if
you
don't
mind
your
honor,
first.
if
--
if
i
may
frame
it,
this
may
add
up
to
the
same
thing
as
--
as
the
outlawry
statement,
but
it's
a
little
bit
more
explicit.
it's
a
little
bit
more
detailed.
we
would
say
that
the
--
that
you
don't
have
to
arrest
a
man
50
times
in
order
to
have
it
--
to
--
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
you
are
prepared
to
arrest
him
on
sight.
we
say
that
when
you
arrest
him
twice
under
circumstances
where
the
record
showed
that
he
is
--
that
there
is
no
ground
on
which
any
reasonable
police
officer
could
have
thought
him
guilty
--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
and
when
you
further
--
mr.
louis
lusky
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
lusky
it
is
here
before
us,
your
honor,
because
it
was
filed
in
a
--
as
an
exhibit
on
the
second
trial.
mr.
louis
lusky
all
the
proceedings.
mr.
louis
lusky
yes,
sir.
it
is
in
this
record
and
you
will
be
able
to
see
--
mr.
louis
lusky
that
there
is
not
--
mr.
louis
lusky
i
beg
--
mr.
louis
lusky
that's
where
he
got
$20
and
30
days.
mr.
louis
lusky
we
--
we
went
up
to
the
circuit
court.
that's
all
we
had
to
go.
we
got
a
directed
acquittal.
mr.
louis
lusky
but
what
we
say
is
that
--
that
when
you
coupled
a
complete
lack
of
proof
on
these
two
charges
with
the
explicit
statement
of
the
police
to
this
petitioner
on
january
14th,
that
they
are
arresting
him
because
he
pleaded
not
guilty
and
hired
a
lawyer
and
--
and
resisted
this
first
charge,
we
say
that
this
is
enough
to
show
what
they're
going
to
do
from
now
on.
and
of
course,
i
could
--
the
record
doesn't
show
what's
happened
since
this
case
was
finished,
but
it's
plenty.
now,
on
the
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
as
to
whether
the
police
in
the
present
case
knew
about
it,
here
is
what
the
record
shows
exactly.
there
were
two
police
officers
who
made
the
arrests
that
led
to
the
convictions
hereunder
review.
first,
officer
barnett,
when
he
walked
into
this
little
café
where
the
loitering
arrest
was
made,
he
went
up
to
the
manager
and
he
said,
“who
is
that
man
over
in
the
middle
of
the
floor?”
and
the
manager
said,
“it's
sam
thompson.”
“how
long
has
he
been
here?”
“half
an
hour.”
“has
he
bought
anything?”
“i
haven't
seen
him
buy
anything.
i
haven't
sold
him
anything,”
said
the
manager.
there
were
other
people
that
could
have
sold
him
and
did.
then
he
said
--
the
manager
--
the
manager
said,
“well,
he
hasn't
done
anything
wrong,
has
he?”
and
the
man
and
--
and
office
barnett
said,
“he
has
been
in
something
down
at
the
bus
station.”
this
referred
to
the
incident
10
days
before
that
led
to
the
first
appealable
sentence.
so,
barnett
did
--
on
the
--
on
the
--
on
mark's,
the
café
manager's
testimony,
barnett
did
know
about
the
previous
incident
and
had
it
in
his
mind
when
he
made
the
arrest.
now,
barnett
did
not
call
--
was
not
called
as
a
prosecution
witness
at
the
trial
and
did
not
testify.
he
was
not
available
to
be
examined
by
us.
mr.
louis
lusky
lesfield
(ph)
did
testify
and
said
that
he
did
not
know
about
the
earlier
incident
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
that
is
the
exact
state
of
the
record
on
that.
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
louis
lusky
mark.
mr.
louis
lusky
yes.
mr.
louis
lusky
barnett.
mr.
louis
lusky
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
if
--
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
will
--
i
will
simply
--
i
would
like
to
save
what
time
i
have,
if
i
may,
for
a
short
opportunity
to
rebuttal.
what
we
say,
in
effect,
is
that
this
outlawry
is
we
believe,
fully
established
by
the
record
in
--
in
the
manner
in
which
i
--
i
said,
but
beyond
that,
we
say
that
this
is
--
we
--
we
have
--
our
client
is
not
only
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
and
property
with
--
of
due
process
by
these
police
arrests,
but
also
by
the
action
of
the
police
court
in
perfecting
and
really
sealing
tight
the
door
against
a
civil
action
which
would
give
the
--
the
petitioner
his
only
way
of
defending
himself
against
this
kind
of
--
of
activity
on
the
part
of
the
police.
mr.
louis
lusky
because,
your
honor,
under
kentucky
law,
a
conviction
prevents
you
from
suing
the
policeman
who
has
arrested
you.
mr.
louis
lusky
you
just
can't
do
it.
and
if
--
unless
you
can
get
the
conviction
reversed,
you
are
through
with
the
civil
action
and
kentucky
says
if
--
if
--
that
the
police
judge
can
prevent
you
from
ever
getting
it
reversed
in
any
kentucky
court
and
he
can
do
this
by
first
of
all,
giving
you
a
sentence
too
small
for
appeal.
and
second,
by
knowing
that
under
the
rule
which
prevails
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
no
collateral
attack
is
possible
on
the
judgment.
mr.
louis
lusky
we
don't
think
it
has
to
allow
a
plenary
appellate
review,
your
honor.
but
we
do
maintain
that
under
mooney
against
holohan
and
related
cases,
it
does
have
to
afford
some
corrective
judicial
process
for
violations
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
louis
lusky
we
have
--
an
action
for
malicious
prosecution
or
false
imprisonment
is
the
normal
proceeding.
mr.
louis
lusky
i
imagine
you
could
--
if
you
could
--
normally,
the
--
the
--
a
court
of
equity
will
not
entertain
a
collateral
attack
on
a
judgment
of
the
criminal
court.
this
is
the
--
this
is
why
we're
out
of
court
on
false
imprisonment,
unless
we
get
this
judgment
set
aside.
mr.
louis
lusky
to
filing
it
away?
mr.
louis
lusky
it
does,
yes.
and
when
the
--
mr.
louis
lusky
statute
of
kentucky
when?
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
flaunt
the
statute
or
the--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
mr.
louis
lusky
he
does.
mr.
louis
lusky
that's
right.
mr.
louis
lusky
we
didn't.
on
--
mr.
louis
lusky
in
the
first
case,
we
didn't
give
it
and
he
didn't
file
it
away.
mr.
louis
lusky
he
just
--
he
just
said,
“you're
guilty.”
mr.
louis
lusky
he
just
said,
“you're
guilty.”
he
didn't
file
it
away.
he
decided
the
case.
mr.
louis
lusky
yes.
in
this
case,
he
didn't
even
propose
to
file
them,
but
he
already
knew
that
what
we've
say
if
the
offer
--
mr.
louis
lusky
no,
sir.
we
say
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
for
kentucky
--
for
kentucky
to
create
a
legal
situation
in
which
a
man
can
be
harassed
by
the
police
and
can
by
the
sole
judgment
of
a
single
judicial
officer
acting
wholly
arbitrarily
as
the
record
shows,
be
foreclosed
from
any
effective
way
of
defending
himself
against
a
continuation
of
that.
now
--
mr.
louis
lusky
that
is
right,
we
think.
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
we
felt,
your
honor,
that
it
was
our
obligation
to
present
to
the
court
all
the
issues
that
the
record
raised.
i
mean,
i
don't
say
that
we
would
be
content
or
not
--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
content,
that's
not
the
important
thing.
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
they
don't
say
it
to
this
court
very
much,
your
honor.
and
when
they
do
--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
this
court
talks
back.
mr.
louis
lusky
could
--
i
--
i
think
i
have
--
mr.
louis
lusky
i'm
not
abandoning
anything.
mr.
louis
lusky
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
we
--
we
would
say,
if
--
if
there
were
nothing
in
this
case
except
that
--
that
this
man
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
when
there
was
absolutely
no
proof
of
guilt,
we
would
say
that
that
in
itself,
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
but
we
are
not
required
to
go
that
far,
we
say
that
coupled
with
all
the
other
things
in
this
record,
it's
certainly
a
--
a
conviction
that
could
be
set
aside.
mr.
louis
lusky
i
don't
say
whether
we
would
or
not.
i
would've
said
--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
i
wouldn't
have
been
astonished,
if
you
denied
certiorari.
mr.
louis
lusky
i
stood
you.
[laughter]
mr.
louis
lusky
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
it
--
it's
a
violation
of
due
process,
your
honor,
under
--
under
the
basic
rule
of
davidson
against
new
orleans,
which
says
where
--
where
substantive
due
process,
as
i
understand
it,
originated.
it
says
that
a
state
has
no
power
to
declare
the
property
of
a
to
be
the
property
of
b,
with
no
reason
for
it.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
when
you
fine
a
man
$10
for
no
cause.
mr.
louis
lusky
no,
it
just
has
to
allow
him
some
kind
of
review
of
his
constitutional
claims.
it's
not
full
appellate
review.
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up
and
could
i
ask
--
mr.
louis
lusky
i
think
--
mr.
louis
lusky
thank
--
mr.
louis
lusky
very
--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
gracious,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
lusky
12.
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
there's
a
great
variety
of
crime.
we
could
give
you
a
list,
if
you
want.
mr.
louis
lusky
unfortunately,
your
honor,
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
argue.
this
is
an
extraordinary
case.
mr.
louis
lusky
i'm
afraid
that
it
is
a
very
ordinary
case.
mr.
louis
lusky
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
lusky
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
we
don't
claim
that
sam
thompson
is
the
only
outcast
that
has
been
created
by
the
louisville
police
court
or
even
that
it's
a
very
ordinary
thing
in
louisville.
and
we
assume
that
the
reason
that
this
court
has
been
willing
to
give
its
time
to
this
case
is
that
it's
not
an
ordinary
thing.
now
--
mr.
louis
lusky
i
would
like
to
speak
of
this
jurisdictional
question
because,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
says,
it
is
a
basic
question
and
--
and
it
goes
to
the
--
to
the
root
of
this
court's
power
to
hear
the
case.
i
--
i
would
like
to
ask
one
thing.
i
--
i
didn't
understand
whether
mr.
frick
said
that
this
case
which
he
intends
to
send
to
us
is
a
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
entertained
an
application
for
relief,
although
the
sentence
was
too
small
for
appeal.
and
i
would
like
to
ask
whether
it
is
such
a
case.
mr.
louis
lusky
if
the
court
please,
i
--
i
am
going
to
do
my
best
to
confine
myself
the
10
minutes
that's
been
allowed.
i
--
i
have
taken
note
that
some
indulgence
had
been
granted
to
opposing
counsel.
and
if
i
run
over
a
little
bit,
i
--
i
hope
i
may
be
forgive,
particularly
since
this
basic
question
of
jurisdiction
has
been
raised.
now,
i
think
it's
quite
important
to
understand
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
this
court
has
a
pretty
clear
conception
of
it
now,
as
these
questions
have
indicated.
the
situation
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
is
that
--
that
substantive
relief
will
not
be
granted
under
the
power
established
by
section
110
of
the
constitution,
even
though
a
federal
constitutional
claim,
a
due
process
claim
is
made,
if
the
sentence
is
too
small
for
appeal.
this
appears
in
a
series
of
cases
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
(inaudible)
is
the
latest
i
think,
walters
against
fowler,
thompson
against
wood
.and
walters
against
fowler,
which
is
the
case
where
the
point
is
most
fully
discussed,
as
it
happens,
does
not
specifically
refer
in
the
court's
opinion
to
section
110.
so,
you
can't
tell
from
reading
the
court's
opinion
that
it's
a
section
110
case,
although
it
is
the
only
source
of
jurisdiction.
now,
in
order
to
--
i
thought
this
might
puzzle
the
court
when
the
time
came
to
read
the
opinion
and
in
--
in
the
walters
case.
and
therefore,
in
order
to
eliminate
any
doubt
on
that
score,
i
have
obtained
from
the
clerk
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
under
the
seal
of
that
court,
a
certified
copy
of
the
petition
for
relief
in
walters
against
fowler,
which
shows
that
relief
was
sought
under
section
110
of
the
constitution.
this
is
a
little
technical
question
that
could
come
up
and
if
there
is
no
objection,
i'd
like
to
file
it
in
the
case.
mr.
louis
lusky
the
--
now,
here
is
exactly
the
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
had
--
for
the
reasons
which
i
explained
yesterday.
we
were
under
the
necessity
of
keeping
the
petitioner
out
of
jail
for
--
until
we
could
get
certiorari
ruled
on
in
this
court
so
that
the
case
wouldn't
become
moot.
we
thought
that
the
proper
--
proper
remedy
-
remedy
was
habeas
corpus
in
circuit
court,
which
does
have
power
to
fix
bail
where
it's
required
by
law
and
we
--
and
the
circuit
judge
agreed
with
us
and
granted
it.
the
city
took
an
appeal
from
that
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
city
and
the
court
of
appeals
argued
that
there
was
no
way
we
could
get
a
review
at
all,
there
or
any
place
else
and
that
therefore,
it
was
--
it
would
be
a
futile
thing
to
grant
a
stay.
that
excerpts
--
pertinent
excerpts
from
their
brief
in
that
court
are
cited
in
our
--
in
our
brief
and
in
our
petition
for
--
reply
brief
on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
court
of
appeals
held,
in
a
4-to-3
opinion
that
it
would
not
depart
from
the
rule
of
walters
against
fowler
as
far
as
substantive
relief
was
concerned.
they
did,
however,
agree
the
four-man
majority
--
the
four-judge
majority
did
agree
that
we
had
a
federal
right
to
an
opportunity
for
a
federal
hearing
on
our
federal
claim
and
that
they
--
they
could,
without
inconsistency
with
walters
against
fowler,
open
the
way
for
the
presentation
of
that
claim
to
this
court,
even
though
they
were
--
they
considered
themselves
bound
by
their
previous
decision,
not
to
entertain
our
claim
on
the
merits.
now,
the
proof
of
that
--
the
proof
of
that
has
already
been
suggested
in
questions
that
have
been
asked
and
it's
--
and
it's
--
it's
very
obvious.
the
court
was
--
was
indulgent
with
this
procedure.
they
said,
“if
we
wanted
to
--
to
cut
this
thing
square,
what
we
would
do
would
be
to
reverse
this
case
because
judge
lawrence
grauman
in
the
circuit
court
had
no
power
to
grant
the
relief
that
he's
granted.
and
you
then
could
come
in
with
an
application
for
similar
relief
in
this
court
and
we
would
grant
it.
we
know
we'd
grant
it
because
we've
had
a
full
hearing
on
the
case,
oral
argument
even,
which
is
very
rare
in
that
court.
and
so,
rather
--
rather
than
make
you
go
to
all
the
trouble
and
expense
of
starting
over,
we're
going
to
grant
this
on
our
own
motion.
now,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
if
they
had
thought
that
relief
could
be
granted
on
the
merits,
they
--
in
that
court,
they
would
have
done
one
or
two
--
of
two
things.
either
they
would
have
granted
a
stay
long
enough
for
us
to
apply
in
that
court,
or
they
would
have
granted
complete
relief
which
they
could
have
done
because
they
had
the
full
record
before
them,
including
the
evidence.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
court
shows
on
its
face
that
they
had
every
--
everything
except
the
transcript
of
the
evidence.
and
since
that
doesn't
show,
i
have
obtained
from
the
court
of
appeals,
a
certificate,
again,
under
the
seal
of
the
court,
certifying
which
was
the
fact
that
the
evidence
--
that
the
same
evidence
which
is
printed
in
the
--
in
the
record
here.
the
transcripts
of
the
two
trials
were
filed
with
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
in
that
case.
so,
they
had
the
same
record
which
you
have.
they
showed
that
they
do
not
consider
themselves
embarrassed
by
the
failure
to
ask
for
the
particular
relief
which
they
thought
was
proper.
and
they
went
just
as
far
as
they
could
go
under
the
kentucky
precedence
to
grant
us
relief
which
was
simply
to
open
the
door
into
this
court.
now,
three
judges
of
the
court
said
walters
against
fowler
precludes
us
from
betting
relief.
everybody
agrees
to
that
and
it's
--
it's
ridiculous
to
suggest
that
the
supreme
court
would
take
its
time
with
the
case
like
this.
so,
they
dissented
on
the
ground
that
the
stay
that
was
being
granted
would
be
futile,
but
the
whole
court
agreed
that
there
was
no
basis
for
substantive
relief
and
the
--
the
--
if
you
--
if
you
read
the
--
the
--
another
passage
of
the
court.
if
you
--
if
you
will
look
at
page
38
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
appendix
of
that
petition,
this
is
what
judge
porter
sims
says.
first
complete
paragraph,
“appellee
appears
to
have
a
real
question
as
to
whether
he
has
been
denied
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution,
yet,
this
substantive
right
cannot
be
tested
unless
we
grant
him
a
stay
of
execution
because
his
fines
are
not
appealable
and
will
be
satisfied
by
being
served
in
jail
before
he
can
prepare
and
file
his
petition
for
certiorari.”
and
then,
they
go
on
and,
on
the
next
page,
they
distinguished
that
walters
case
not
on
the
ground
that
the
--
that
walters
was
being
kicked
around
anymore
than
thompson
was
being
kicked
around.
but,
on
the
ground
that
thompson
wanted
to
go
to
a
different
court
than
walters,
was
trying
to
get
into.
it
is
only
in
an
extreme
case,
in
other
words,
as
he
says,
it
is
only
in
extreme
cases
like
the
one
at
bar,
where
a
person
wants
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
that
we
will
interfere.
mr.
louis
lusky
there
is
none.
mr.
louis
lusky
that's
right.
mr.
louis
lusky
only
in
a
--
in
cases
where
a
substantial
federal
questions
are
shown
on
the
record
--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
and
where
the
petitioner
desires
to
get
into
this
--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
court.
mr.
louis
lusky
to
my
knowledge,
sir,
there
is
no
case
where
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
has
granted
substantive
relief
from
a
sentence
too
small
for
appeal.
and
--
and
it
--
it
--
in
this
--
in
this
very
case,
they've
--
they've
specifically
said
they
won't
do
it.
now,
there're
are
a
couple
more
points,
if
i
--
i
may,
i
know
my
10
minutes
is
nearly
up,
but
i'd
just
like
to
run
quickly
through
a
few
points
which
are
of
some
importance.
first
of
all,
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
what
--
that
this
alternative
state
remedy
which,
as
has
been
suggested,
is
a
collateral
attack.
now,
this
court
has
held
in
the
case
of
largent
against
texas
in
318
u.s.
418,
that
as
long
as
you've
taken
the
criminal
case
as
high
as
it
will
go
on
direct
appeal,
you
are
not
required
to
exhaust
extraordinary
remedies
set
up
under
the
state
law
in
order
to
perfect
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
now,
it's
possible
that
--
that
the
existence
of
such
remedies
might
have
a
bearing
on
the
--
this
court's
willingness
to
exercise
this
jurisdiction
by
granting
certiorari.
but
that
case
says
that
--
that
jurisdiction
exist
when
you
have
taken
your
case
to
the
highest
state
court
in
which
a
--
in
which
a
decision
can
be
held.
now,
the
second
thing
i
would
like
to
say
is
a
question
was
raised
by
mr.
frick
as
to
how
the
--
the
january
20th
transcript
got
into
this
february
3rd
trial.
and
he
suggested
it
only
got
in
partway
because
it
was
offered
to
show
dr.
dean's
testimony.
the
fact
is
that
he
has
overlooked
that
it
--
that
it
came
in
two
ways.
it
came
in
with
connection
with
the
avow
and
on
--
at
the
--
at
the
top
of
page
70,
you
will
see
that
in
the
avow,
that
this
transcript
was
tendered
for
all
purpose.
that
a
trial
on
said
charges
was
held
in
louisville
police
court
on
that
date,
january
20th
at
which
no
evidence
was
introduced
to
support
the
charges
as
evidenced
by
the
transcript
of
evidence
authenticated
by
the
certificate
of
james
giovanni
(ph)
official
stenographer
of
said
police
court.
the
counterpart
original
copy
of
which
transcript
has
attest
hereto
and
tendered
in
evidence
herewith,
so
that
that
whole
transcript
is
a
proper
part
of
this
record.
now
--
and
incidentally,
since
the
court
rejected
proof
of
harassment
by
the
police,
holding
that
it
was
legally
immaterial,
it
must
be
assumed
as
a
matter
of
law
on
this
record
that
such
harassment
did
exist.
i
think
that
is
the
effect
of
an
--
of
a
rejected
offer
of
proof
the
--
for
the
--
for
--
that
this
court
must
assume
the
proper
evidence
to
be
true.
that
was
the
case
in
moore
against
depmsey
and
--
and
various
other
cases,
i'm
sure
you're
familiar
with,
more
familiar
than
i
am.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
about
the
--
about
the
original
charges.
this
is
the
original
record
which
contains
photocopies
of
the
arrest
slips.
they
--
they
are
informal.
they
do
contain
the
two
charges
and
if
the
court
wishes
to
examine
them,
they're
at
pages
1
and
2
of
the
--
of
the
original
transcript.
mr.
louis
lusky
no,
sir.
we're
not.
mr.
louis
lusky
no,
sir.
we're
not.
and
i'll
tell
you
why
we're
not.
mr.
louis
lusky
we
have
not.
mr.
louis
lusky
we
have
challenged
the
--
the
judgment
of
the
court.
that
is
the
reason
we
brought
this
case
here
on
certiorari
rather
than
appeal.
we
challenged
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
the
reason
we
did,
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
state
it,
if
--
with
--
with
your
indulgence,
the
reason
we
did
is
that
it
will
not
do
this
petitioner
any
good
at
all
to
get
this
statute
held
or
ordinance
held
invalid
on
its
face
or
as
applied
if
our
--
we
are
correct
in
our
contention
that
he
is
going
to
be
arrested
whenever
he
is
seen
by
a
policeman
because
there
are
lots
of
statutes
and
the
--
and
--
and
if
the
disorderly
conduct
statute
is
held
invalid
as
applied
in
this
case,
why
he
--
he
can
be
--
be
arrested
next
week
creating
a
creampuff
with
the
--
with
the
wrong
expression
on
his
face
and
you
have
a
new
constitutional
question
as
far
as
this
--
the
ordinance
--
mr.
louis
lusky
--
is
concerned.
mr.
louis
lusky
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
lusky
that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
--
that
is
all
that's
here
because
that
the
first
case,
we
got
--
we
--
we
already
have
gotten
reversed
in
a
court
that
had
jurisdiction
over
it.
now,
the
--
the
circuit
court,
where
we
got
our
directed
acquittal.
now,
on
this
point
of
--
of
whether
--
of
whether
you
can
do
anything
more
than
reverse,
it
would
be
presumptuous
for
me
to
suggest
anything
--
i
mean
any
--
that
put
the
right
opinions
for
this
court.
but
the
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
tell
you
one
fact
with
which
has
come
into
existence
since
this
--
this
court
granted
certiorari,
which
gives
this
case
a
special
importance
in
kentucky.
in
december,
the
outgoing
general
assembly
voted
to
call
a
constitutional
convention.
and
early
this
month,
the
new
general
assembly
has
done
the
same
thing,
so
that
this
fall,
the
voters
are
going
to
--
are
going
to
vote
on
whether
we
should
have
a
new
--
a
--
a
convention
to
revise
our
1891
constitution
that
contains
this
medieval
court
system.
if
that
convention
is
caused,
it
would
be
a
tremendous
help
to
the
delegates
of
that
convention.
if
this
court
had
spelled
out,
at
least
to
some
extent,
with
special
reference
to
the
judicial
system
of
kentucky,
what
the
minimum
requirements
of
essential
justice
in
a
modern
system
of
criminal
law
administration
are.
and
i
simply
say
that
because
it
so
happens
that
this
case
is
timely
from
that
viewpoint.
mr.
louis
lusky
yes,
sir.
that's
so
stipulated
appeal
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
lusky
12
times,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
lusky
12
times
since
--
since
january
the
24th,
1959.
he's
in
jail
now.
[laughter]
mr.
louis
lusky
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
lusky
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
lusky
i
haven't
asked
it.
the
court
asked
mr.
frick
with
how
many
times
--
mr.
louis
lusky
and
he
--
he
said
he
didn't
know
and
i
said
12
and
--
and
that
i'd
provide
a
list
if
he
wanted
and
--
and
mr.
frick,
who
is
my
old
friend
and
classmate,
says
that
if
i
said,
he'll
stipulate
it.
and
that's
all
it
amounts
to,
i
mean,
if
you
--
if
you
want
it,
we'll
file
it.
if
you
don't
want
it,
we
won't.
i
don't
--
mr.
louis
lusky
well,
i'll
say
this.
mr.
louis
lusky
if
any
member
of
this
--
mr.
louis
lusky
if
any
--
mr.
louis
lusky
if
any
member
of
the
court
--
if
any
member
of
the
court
would
like
to
have
it,
lay
with
the
consent
of
opposing
counsel
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
lusky
your
honor,
when
this
court
speaks,
everyone
listens.
mr.
louis
lusky
i
hadn't
intended
to
ask
that.
all
i
intended
to
do
was
to
acquaint
this
court
with
the
fact
that
this
case
might
have
a
--
a
special
importance
to
the
people
in
my
home
state,
because
it
comes
up
at
this
particular
time.
i
didn't
mean
to
be
presumptuous
anyway.
now,
if
--
i
--
i
don't
want
to
presume
any
further
on
the
court's
time,
but
there
are
just
a
few
detailed
points
that
i
would
like
to
take
off,
if
i
may.
first,
the
--
the
--
i
--
i
will
say
that
this
case
is
--
this
place
is
referred
to
as
a
saloon.
this
is
the
way
the
police
referred
to
it
and
i
noticed
that
--
that
is
been
referred
to
that
way
in
argument.
it
is
not
a
saloon.
it
is
a
tavern
that
is
licensed
to
sell
beer
only.
this
is
just
the
--
a
term
which
has
been
injected
into
the
case.
the
--
on
the
question
whether
the
--
whether
the
petitioner
could
have
been
properly
waiting
for
a
bus
in
a
tavern
which
was
half
a
block
--
block
away
from
a
bus
stop
and
was
on
a
different
street
that
ran
the
other
way.
you
have
to
know
the
fact
that
the
--
these
suburban
buses
run
on
schedules
and
the
next
bus
wasn't
due
for
half
an
hour.
and
as
far
as
whether
the
--
whether
he
was
dancing
or
not,
mr.
justice
whittaker
pointed
out
that
marks
(ph)
the
café
proprietor,
did
not
consider
what
he
was
doing
as
dancing.
he
said
he
didn't
think
it
was
dancing
and
of
course,
from
a
police
regulation
point
of
view,
the
significance
of
dancing
is
that
it
is
men
and
women
dancing
together,
two
people
dancing.
that's
the
thing
that
creates
problems.
now,
on
the
question
of
what
was
the
[laughter]
--
and
some
non-legal
problems.
i
--
i
think
that's
--
that's
about
all
that
i
--
that
i
really
think
i
should
take
your
time
for,
your
honors,
and
i
do
thank
you
for
your
indulgence.
would
you
like
to
have
the
list
of
arrests
or
not?
