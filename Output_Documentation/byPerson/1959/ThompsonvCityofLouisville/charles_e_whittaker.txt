justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
clear
and
undisputed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
is
no
power
in
the
court
--
intermediate
court
of
appeals
to
hear
this
under
any
circumstances?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
they're
different
--
different
arrests
in
a
different
offense.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
mr.
(voice

--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
mack,
wasn't
it,
who
decided
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mark
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
what
would
he
say
of
bar
or
whatever
it
is
and
he
did
testify
didn't
he,
to
the
statement
by
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
barnett.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
how
is
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
--
is
that
violation
of
due
process?
does
the
state
have
to
allow
any
appeal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
troubled
by
--
by
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
troubled
to
this
extent.
you've
answered
mr.
justice
black
that
your
position
is
that
this
man
was
convicted
without
any
semblance
of
evidence
at
all
and
that
violates
substantive
due
process.
now,
i
wonder
if
the
fact
that
kentucky
sees
fit
to
permit
the
imposition
of
a
fine
as
small
as
$10
without
any
appellate
redress
and
therefore,
permits
that
such
a
fine
without
evidence,
whether
that
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
can
you
give
me
any
light
on
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
know,
but
the
state
here
doesn't
have
to
or
doesn't
have
to
allow
him
an
appeal.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
there
any
showing
that
he
violated
those
charge,
that
he
violated
a
particular
section
of
the

mr.

whittaker
mr.
fink.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
fink,
may
i
ask
you
where
you
would
have
had
him
wait
for
the
bus
on
this
february
9th?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
at
the
bus
station?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
would
you
have
him
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
have
him
wait
at
the
bus
station?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
where
he
was
arrested
for
doing
that
just
three
days
before.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
yes,
but
this
was
a
cold
night.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
a
violation
of
the
ordinance
of
louisville
for
an
old
colored
man
to
go
into
a
bar
and
to
be
guilty
of
loitering
and
disorderly
conduct
simply
because
he
taps
his
foot
to
music
on
a
barroom
floor
as
he
waits
for
a
bus
on
a
cold
winter
night?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
must
be
supported
by
what?
by
evidence.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
--
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
he
said,
“you
might
call
it
shuffling,”
but
i
would
say
he
was
tapping
his
feet
to
music.
now,
isn't
that
what
he
said?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
that's
all
you
claim
that
constitute
disorderly
conduct?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do
not
relate
the
shuffling
inside
disorderly
conduct?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
one
thing
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
what
as
he
got
outside,
it's
in
the
record
inside
taken
outright
while
he
waited
for
what
you
call
in
the
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
what
the
record
shows
to
tell
me.
there
were
some
arguments
between
the
officers.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
a
man
protested
that
he
was
being
persecuted
because
he's
been
arrested
several
times
before
for
minor
offenses
and
there
was
an
argument
of
it
and
that's
if
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
disorderly
conduct
under
your
ordinance?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
say,
sir,
about
the
two
questions
involved,
number
one,
is
there
any
forum
in
kentucky
where
this
man
might,
under
these
circumstances,
seek
relief
from
the
judgment
of
the
$10
fine
imposed
by
the
police
court
would
have
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
if
i
correctly
understood
you
or
you
--
if
i
did,
you
really
said
what
you
meant.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals,
on
this
state
proceeding,
said
that
the
only
place
where
the
man
could
have
relief
was
here.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
say
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
that's
to
say
they
couldn't
grant
any,
is
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
are
the
one
who
had
asked.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
fowler?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
if
you
say
so.
the
application
that
you
made
in
accordance
directed
you
notwithstanding
the
unappealability
case
otherwise,
they
wouldn't
appeal.
otherwise,
for
how
do
you
think
you've
depended
on
the
next
supreme
case
pose
a
much
less
sentence.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
don't
argue
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
too.
is
it
clear,
i'm
not
sure
--
do
we
have
a
stipulation
as
to
arrest
of
mr.
thompson
since
this
one
in
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
how
many
times
would
