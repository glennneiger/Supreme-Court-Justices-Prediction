all
right.
chief

for
half
hour.
you

the

he
didn't
see
him

and
he
said
he
could
have
bought

was
in
a
department
store
and
was
shuffling
alone
in
a
department
store
and
haven't
purchased
anything
for
half
hour.
would
he
be
guilty
of
loitering?

there'd
be
a
lot
of
women
in
jail,
sir.[laughter]
chief

ever
as
long
as
they
live?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
that
this
evidence
shows
that
--
that
this
man,
no
matter
how
long
he
might
live,
had
no
intention
ever
of
buying
anything
in
this
store
because
of
the
evidence
you
have
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
that
apply
then
to
the
department
store?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
the
purpose
of
a
place
--
of
a
place
of
business
what
the
operator
of
it
considers
it
to
be?
and
if
he
considers
a
man
was
properly
there,
if
he
wasn't
doing
anything
that
was
specifically
unlawful,
isn't
he
there
lawfully?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he's
there
under
the
expressed
or
implied,
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
didn't
--
didn't
the
owner
say
that
the
man
was
welcome
there
that
he
had
no
objections
to
him
being
there
and
haven't
done
anything
offensive?
what
more
could
you
--
what
more
could
you
ask
to
have
--
have
an
implied
willingness
for
him
to
be
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
put
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
man
in
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
put
a
man
in
jail
--
you
could
put
a
man
in
jail
for
--
for
arguing
back
and
forth
with
the
police
officer
when
he's
put
under
arrest,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
say
that's
correct?
you
should
--
is
competent
evidence
and
sufficient
evidence
to
send
a
man
to
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
in
the
--
in
the
evidence
to
say
that
it
resulted
in
public
disorder?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
why
do
you
add
that
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
--
there
isn't
--
i
don't
think
anybody
is
arguing
with
you
that
all
the
evidence
shows
is
that
he
argued
back
and
forth
with
the
officers
about
his
arrest.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
say
that
that's
sufficient
under
you
laws,
to
put
a
man
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

--
is
that
argued

your
brief,
mr.

your
brief?

justice
earl
warren

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.

your
brief,

chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
it
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
give
us
that?
as
i
understood
it
that,
the
--
the
record
said
that
the
police
had
handed
--
handed
the
judge
the
record
to
this
man
and
it
showed
54
arrests.

justice
earl
warren
did
you
show
the
54
arrests?

chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
isn't
in
the
record.

isn't
in
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
frick.

this
man
been
arrested
since
this
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
times?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
times?
chief
justice
earl
warren
12
times
for
this
same
kind
of
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
if
you
don't
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
don't
know,
you
can't
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
--
will
you
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
get
that
case
and
file
it
with
the
clerk
and
serve
it
onto
counsel,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
may
make
the
record
of
it
and
give
it
to
the
court,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
--
i
asked
the
question.
you're
not
wording
it
up
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
asked
for
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren

the
information
and
he
shouldn't
be
held
responsible
for
my
action.
chief
justice

you
might
as
well
file
them.
