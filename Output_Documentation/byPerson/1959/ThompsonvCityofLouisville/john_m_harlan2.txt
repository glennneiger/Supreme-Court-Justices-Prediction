one
thing
i'm
just
curious
about,
why
didn't
you
ask,
his
honor,
the
police
judge,
to
give
you
a
$20
fine
the
way
you
did
in
the
earlier
case
and
then
you
could've
gone
up
to
kentucky
court
of
appeals
and
if
i
read
their
opinion
that
you've
been
referring
to
correctly,
you
probably
would
not
come
to
washington
at
all.

justice
john
m.
harlan
with
time
running
on
and
not
too
far,
i
wonder
if
you
could
state
precisely
what
you
conceive
the
due
process
point
to
be
on
the
first
point
in
your
argument,
in
your
brief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
the
lack
of
evidence
point.
at
least
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
be
about
in
the
points
mixed
up.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
record
is
undisputed
that
these
arresting
officers
in
this
particular
case,
their
testimony
was
undisputed
that
they'd
never
seen
this
fellow
and
never
heard
of
him
on
the
time
they
arrested
him.
justice
john
m.
harlan
wrong
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
point
you're
making,
i
take
it
is
that
if
this
was
an
isolated
case,
this
fellow
had
been
--
never
been
arrested
before
and
you
had
this
same
record
in
a
conviction,
you
wouldn't
have
tried
to
bring
the
case
up
here.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
don't
want
to
put
you
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
a
contention
made
in
the
proceeding
that
we're
reviewing
that
this
was
simply
a
course
of
conduct
of
harassment
against
this
man?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
that
avow?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
be
in
the
original
record
though?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
be
in
the
original
record,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
want
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
went
to
the
records
of
the
police
court,
would
you
find
a
piece
of
paper
there
that

so-and-so

are
the

there
is
a

it's
not
here
in

(voice

--

he
would
go
at
gunshot
at
the
bus
station.
justice
john

but
he
said
in
himself
on
page
24
with
respect
to
the
contrary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
where
you
were
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
were
you
--
“were
you
or
not
respectful
to
the
officers?”
answer,
“yes,
i
was.
i've
never
been
any
other
way.
i
just
asked
them
what
they
are
arrested
me
for.”
question,
“you
didn't
argue
with
them?
you
just
asked
them
what
they
were
arresting
you
for?”
“yes,
i
asked
what
he
was
locking
me
up
for
and
he
said
for
loitering
and

was
that,
vagrancy?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
that
is
a
disputed
of
issue
of
fact
between
whatever
it
meant
by
the
officer's
testimony
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
were
arguing
and
this
man's
testimony
that
he
was
just
an
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
impolite
inquiry.
you
say
that's
an
issue
of
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
understand
from
anything
in
your
brief
(inaudible)
again
that
you
claimed
that
we
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
see
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
noticed
in
your
--
state
constitution
says,
referring
to
the
power
of
the
courts
of
appeal,
said
courts
shall
have
power
to
issue
such
writs
as
may
be
necessary
to
give
it
a
general
control
over
inferior
jurisdiction.
that
seems
to
be
very
broad.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
has
that
been
construed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
it
been
construed
to
apply
to
a
case
where,
although
there
is
no
direct
right
of
appeal
because
of
the
size
of
the
fine,
as
here,
that
none
(inaudible)
the
court
of
appeals
under
certain
situations
will
issue
extraordinary
writs
to
review
those
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
that
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
this
certainly
indicates
that
they
have
power
to
entertain
it,
does
it
not?
it
does
that
much.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
we
can't
speculate
as
to
what
they
would
or
would
not
have
done
without
having
an
application
made.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
i'd
suppose
you
say
that
--
no
jurisdiction
up
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
lack
of
jurisdictional
question,
but
i'm
looking
for
the
opinion
of
your
court
of
appeals
city
ordinance,
page
38,
you're
referring
to
walters
case,
against
fowler,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
say
that
although
if
they
had
jurisdiction
--
had
jurisdiction
in
that
case,
understanding
the
unappealable
fine
to
grant
extraordinary
writ,
but
they
did
not
in
that
case
because
(inaudible)
were
extreme.
and
then,
they
go
on
and
say
that
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one
is
and
in
that
case,
the
collateral
would
be
to
be
to
stay
in
the
--
in
the
case
as
that
kind
of
a
thing
that
would
--
seem
they
will
exercise
their
jurisdiction
on
a
showing
of
necessity
short
of
what
might
persuade
them
to
take
the
case
on
direct
review.
do
i
read
that
all
correctly?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
deny
that
it
had
the
power
unless
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying,
if
i
get
it
correctly
so
far
as
direct
review
is
concerned
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
none.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
as
far
as
review
by
this
court
is
concerned,
they
will
exercise
their
jurisdiction
over
inferior
courts
only
in
extreme
cases
of
which
this
was
one.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
is
there
any
case
where
the
kentucky
court
has
granted
direct
review?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
the
--
since
--
since
this
case?
