mr.
mr.
attorney
general
if
it
please
the
court,
since
counsel
has
invited
a
stipulation,
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
original
record
which
is
in
this
court
does
include
the
arrest
slips,
which
items
1
and
2
in
that
record.
i've
asked
the
marshal
to
get
the
record
and
it
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes.
