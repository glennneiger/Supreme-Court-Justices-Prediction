chief

well,
mr.
cragun,
is
it
necessary
in
this
case
for
us
to
reach
the
question
of
the
rights
of
--
of
these
indians
vis-a-vis
the
government?
chief

did
anybody
contend
that
we

(voice

done.
well,
then
--
chief

i
won't
--
i

i
just
--
chief

yes.
chief

yes.
chief

mr.

chief
justice
earl

well,
do
we
reach
that
--
do
we
reach
that
question
in
this
case,
mr.
calhoun
or
--
or
should
we
not
obey
that
same
admonition
to
leave
it
to
a
proper
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
litigated
below
as
between
you
and
the
indians
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
to
whether
they
had
any
property
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief

but
the

is
there
whether
it
belongs

it
belongs
to
the
indians,
isn't
it?
chief

but
either

is
binding
on

do
you?
chief

yes.
well,
that's
all
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
chief

mr.

should
--
or
need
we
reach
that
--
that
question
in

case?
chief

thank
you.
mr.

that

(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice

warren
but
does
that
--
did
that
refer
just
to
their
right
to
do
it,
or
was
that
--
whether
that
have
to
do
with
fish
traps
all
over
the
--
all
over
the
country?
chief
justice

warren
yes.
chief

is

is
there
any
consensus

than

chief

i
don't
know.
chief
justice

mr.
rader,
what
--
could
you
tell
us
what
--
about
what
percentage
of
your
--
your
annual
pack
of
--
of
salmon,
the
activities
of
these
indians
would
represent,
is
it
large
or
is
a
small?
chief

board
-
well
what
would
you
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,recess
now.
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rader,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
people
who
are
here
in
court
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no,
no,
excuse
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rader,
do
you
happen
to
know
if
in
any
other
states
where
there
are
indian
reservations,
if
the
government
grabs
any
different
hunting
or
fishing
rights
to
indians
than
--
than
it
does
to
the
general
populace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
--
in
a
way,
but
i
was
thinking
this.
that
--
that
whatever
special
rights
they
might
give
to
--
to
indians
on
reservations
would
probably
fall,
would
they
not,
if
we
decided
with
alaska
in
this
--
in
this
case?
would
we
not
be
saying
at
the
same
time
that
--
that
wherever
the
federal
government
attempted
to
invade
the
police
power
as
you
--
of
the
state
as
you
see
it,
that
--
that
they
have
done
that
unconstitutionally
and
therefore,
the
regulations
or
the
statutes
must
fall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
cover
you
just
once
more
before
you
get
to
your
other
constitutional
argument.
well,
i'll
--
i'll
wait
for
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
that
other
thing
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
mr.
rader,
what
--
what
response
the
secretary
of
the
interior
makes
to
your
argument
that
you
made
just
a
few
moments
ago
about
the
devastation
of
your
fish
life?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
what
these
will
do
--
and
what
these
fish
traps
will
do
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
that
traditionally
been
the
viewpoint
of
the
--
the
department
of
interior
that
the
fish
traps
are
--
are
not
a
conservation
measures?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
these
indians
practice
their
own
fish
or
do
they
do
it
through
some
--
the
canning
company?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
they
bought
a
cannery
10
or
12
years
ago,
one
of
them
12
years
ago,
one
of
them
10
years
ago.they
do
their
own
processing
but
the
managers
for
that
are
--
are
whiz
fish
company
again
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
big
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
they've
been
doing
very
well
in
metlakatla
but
--
but
i
thought
also
--
you
told
us
that
they
have
property
worth
only
about
$350,000
and
they
owed
--
owed
$850,000.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
alright.
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
suppose,
mr.
rader
that
--
that
the
government
--
and
this
government
said
to
you,
the
state
should
have
no
police
power
over
the
reservations,
indian
reservations
in
alaska,
would
it
have
that
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
they
draw
a
line
on
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
independent
--
on
this
islands,
these
particular
islands,
and
say
that
it
--
as
to
that
area
only,
they
had
the
right
to
use
these
fish
traps?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
take
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
take
the
first
case,
826
or
whatever
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
326.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
take
that
--
that
case.
suppose
--
suppose
the
federal
government
said,
“the
state
shall
have
no
police
powers
over
this
reservation.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
why
couldn't
it
do
it
as
to
a
part
of
your
police
powers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
hadn't
said
that
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
said
on
these
independence
islands,
or
whatever
the
name
of
the
island
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
they
didn't
say
any
place
in
alaska
they
could
put
these
things.
they
said
“on
this
reservation”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
about
your
other
laws,
your
other
police
laws
that
the
government
says
they
don't
have
to
obey
on
that
reservation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
they
are
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
i
--
i
asked
you
the
question
that
suppose
the
government
came
along
and
said
that
--
that
we
shall
--
we
will
have
retain
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
there,
over
those
islands.
you
said
you
thought
they
would
have
the
right
to
do
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
case
of
that
reservation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
they
can
do
it
as
to
all
of
their
police
--
your
police
laws,
why
--
why
do
you
cry
about
this
particular
one
and
say
that
they
can't
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
can't
see
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
can
regulate
the
fish
and
game
more
strictly
than
you
do,
can
it
not
if
it's
migratory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
can
--
can
regulate
the
--
the
taking
of
fish
and
game,
can
they
not,
if
it's
migratory
game
or
fish
than
they
do
it
now
to
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
do
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rader,
i
--
i
was
wondering
this
if
--
if
your
interpretation
of
fishing
rights
is
as
limited
as
--
as
you
have
made
it
to
--
to
us,
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
to
say
anything
of
that
kind
at
all.
would
it
--
wouldn't
it
be
necessary
to
make
any
reservation
because
when
alaska
became
a
state,
they
would
have
that
right,
the
same
right
of
all
other
citizens.
so
the
government
must
have
intended
something
else
when
it
reserved
the
rights
of
fishing
in
that
reservation,
mustn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
contest
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
understood
that
you
had
--
that
you
had
construed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understood
that.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rader
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rader,
would
you
mind
speculating
for
a
moment
on
what
the
future
of
these
metlakatla
indians
would
be
if
--
if
the
government
summarily
close
these
fish
traps?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
only
reason
i
was
thinking
in
those
terms
was
because
i
understood
from
what
has
been
said
here
that
--
that
that's
all
there
is
to
this
little
community,
the
fishing
and
they
are
wards
of
the
government,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
set
almost
as
long
as
the
traps.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
were
no
courts
in
existence
from
which
they
could
take
appeals
at
that
time,
were
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
--
on
october
5th.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
came
into
being.
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
that
date
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
that
date
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
the
rules
of
your
court,
your
supreme
court,
how
much
time
would
they
have
to
appeal
from
the
judgment
in
--
in
a
judgment
to
this
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
october
5th.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
judgment
was
earlier?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
satisfaction
of
both
sides?
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
did
you
say?
15
days?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
calhoun,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
want
to
ask
you
a
question.
your
time
is
up
but
--
i
think
he
want
to
ask
you
a
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
