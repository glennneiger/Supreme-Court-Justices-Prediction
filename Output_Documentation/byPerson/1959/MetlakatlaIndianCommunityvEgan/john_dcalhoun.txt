mr.
john
d.calhoun
that
is
the
understanding
of
the
department
of
justice
as
the
position
to
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
john
d.calhoun
it
is
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
that
congress
in
enacting
section
4
reserved
to
itself
power
to
direct
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
authorizes
many
according
to
the
standards
that
they
set
as
are
necessary
to
meet
the
needs
they
want
to
fill.
at
the
moment,
we
believe
there
is
sufficient
authority
under
the
white
act
to
issue
more
than
21
if
conservation
needs
and
the
indians
needs
require
the
issuance
of
more.
mr.
john
d.calhoun
more
than
21.
mr.
john
d.calhoun
i
would
doubt
on
the
basis
of
the
little
myth
that
i
know
about
alaskan
fish
runs
that
he
could
--
he
could
defend
300
without
running
into
an
argument
of
being
rather
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
the
conduct
of
the
administration
of
that
statute.
but
if
--
if
at
any
time,
alaska
is
--
may
challenge
his
--
his
performance
of
his
duty.
i
think
it
has
standing
probably
to
do
that.
certainly,
people
who
were
fishing
in
those
waters
have
standing
to
challenge
these
regulations
but
nobody
has
attacked
that
his
--
saying
that
--
nobody
suggesting
that
the
secretary
has
improperly
administered
a
congressional
mandate.
