mr.
john
l.
rader
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
alaska
was
one
of
the
few
territories
which
were
discriminated
against
in
the
control
of
its
fishing
game
as
a
territory.
the
organic
act
of
1912
prohibited
the
territorial
legislature
from
enacting
any
legislation
whatsoever
concerning
the
fisheries.
consequently,
alaska
never
challenged
anything
that
the
federal
government
did
as
a
territory
because
it
was
expressly
withheld
from
us
into
the
plenary
power
of
the
united
states
to
provide
for
the
government
of
its
territories
and
possessions.
in
alaska,
the
salmon
industry,
the
commercial
salmon
industry
and
we're
not
talking
about
subsistence
here
and
there's
a
great
difference.
the
commercial
salmon
industry,
according
to
our
appendix
2,
in
southeastern
alaska,
and
that
is
the
pan
handle,
what
we
call
the
pan
handle,
the
little
strip
of
land
which
comes
down
along
the
coast
of
canada,
landlocked
canada
actually
in
that
area.
85.9%
of
the
natural
resource
products
of
the
region
are
the
commercial
fishery,
89
--
85.9.
the
commercial
fishery,
under
the
federal
government,
it's
probably
one
of
the
wealthiest,
most
fantastic
fisheries
in
the
world
fell
from
a
peak
productivity
in
1918
of
seven
million
cases
to
less
than
two
million
cases.
the
fishery
is
practically
destroyed.
there
is
enough
seed
left
to
rebuild
it
and
the
people
that
live
in
alaska,
regardless
of
how
it
happened
in
their
federal
management
that
this
fishery
was
practically
destroyed.
the
facts
are
--
the
statistics
are
that
that
is
what
has
happened.
mr.
john
l.
rader
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
absolutely
not.
it
was
open
to
the
exploitation
of
all,
every
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
indians
are
peculiarly
relied
upon
the
fishery.
there's
no
question
about
that
either,
aboriginals,
they
are
reliant.
and
today,
they
are
relied
heavily
upon
the
fishery.
they
are
fishermen.
in
fact,
42%
of
the
relative
alaskan
fishermen
are
indian,
42%.
that's
42%
of
an
industry
which
produces
85%
of
the
total
gross
natural
resource
product
of
the
region.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that
includes
--
we
--
we've
took
the
figures
from
the
census
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
and
it
merely
broke
them
out
as
being
resident
alaskans
employed
in
the
industry.
mr.
john
l.
rader
they
--
they
work
at
times
as
employees
in
canneries.
they
--
they
--
some
owned
their
own
boats.
there
are
mixed
white
crews
and
indian
crews,
but
the
census
of
it
to
break
down
on
a
basis
of
race
as
to
the
occupation
in
the
fishery.
that
was
a
1950
census.
the
people
of
alaska
and
this
movement
was
--
is
not
special
interest
of
alaska.
this
movement
was
lead
by
the
indians
as
having
a
very
great
reliance
on
this
resource,
a
movement
to
abolish
fish
traps.
the
mayor
of
metlakatla,
in
this
case,
states
in
an
affidavit
that
we
wanted
fish
traps
abolished
to
conserve
the
salmon
supply.
now,
we
don't
have
to
argue
too
much
about
conservation
here.
because
appellant,
metlakatla,
concedes
that
this
is
a
conservation
issue.
we
need
not
to
argue
it
too
much,
but
we
can
make
the
same
observation
that
the
solicitor
general
did
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
winans,
concerning
the
fish
wheels
on
the
columbia
river
and
that
is
this,
that
they
take
tons
of
fish
that
not
only
is
the
device
depleting
the
industry,
the
resource,
but
threatens
to
destroy
it.
no
one
knew
this
better
than
the
native
residence,
our
native
citizens,
if
you
please,
of
alaska.
and
they
lead
the
movement
before
anyone
else,
the
alaska
native
brotherhood,
for
the
abolition
of
this
device.
in
1948,
there
was
a
referendum.
we
cite
(inaudible)
in
our
book.
it's
been
recognized
as
an
authority
on
this,
there's
no
question
as
to
the
historical
accuracy
of
what
(inaudible)
relates
angoon,
for
instance,
if
--
if
my
memory
serves
me
right,
voted
120
for
abolition
of
fish
traps
for
seven,
to
retain
fish
craps.
this
is
the
secret
balloting.
a
120
to
abolish
fish
traps,
that
was
1948,
that
was
the
same
year
that
these
people
bought
fish
traps.
actually,
it
was
a
benevolent
desire
of
the
department
of
interior
to
assist
these
people
economically.
mr.
john
l.
rader
mr.
chief
justice,
we've
always
assumed
up
there
that
we
were
equals
regardless
of
race.
these
people
were
not
on
a
reservation,
they
were
as
much
a
part
of
us
as
anyone
else.
it
was
a
general
application,
the
absolute
abolition
of
fish
traps.
mr.
john
l.
rader
this
court
observed
in
any
case
(inaudible)
the
efficiency
of
the
seine.
refers
to
the
--
a
--
a
certain
type
of
seine.
and
that
made
it
objectionable
from
a
conservation
nature.
in
patsone
versus
pennsylvania,
this
court
determined
that
it
wouldn't
argue
with
the
state
as
to
as
conservation
methods,
unless
in
it
was
so
clearly
something
else
as
to
perhaps
offend
the
good
sense
of
anyone.
i
don't
think
that
that
case
is
presented
at
all
today.
mr.
john
l.
rader
there's
an
argument
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
certainly,
the
federal
government,
in
its
control
of
the
fishery,
has
consistently
maintained
that
a
dead
fish
--
or
dead
fish,
now,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
when
you
catch
it
with
a
trap
or
with
a
net.
the
fact
the
traps
are
more
efficient,
may
--
it
may
cost
$40,000
to
$50,000
to
install
one,
but
they're
--
they're
more
efficient
because
they
fish
24
hours
a
day.
a
man
with
nets
is
limited
by
his
physical
--
by
physical
exhaustion.
he's
limited
by
the
weather.
he's
limited
by
his
--
his
necessity
to
reach
his
supply
base.
it's
the
marine
way
of
life
in
small
boats
and
they're
limited,
compared
to
a
trap
and
a
trap
a
highly
efficient
device.
it's
an
under
water
throughout,
that
extends
out
into
the
--
on
what
we
consider
to
be
our
inland
waters
and
our
tidelands
and
incidentally,
our
fish
and
game,
a
migratory
resource
that
is
not
like
corn
and
--
and
raised
on
the
60
acres
on
which
these
people
claim
metlakatla.
it's
a
bird
just
as
sure
as
in
missouri
versus
holland,
that
flies
though
their
reservation
and
out.
and
it
must
be
conserved,
both
before
it
enters
it
and
after,
at
least.
but
the
fish
trap
issue,
for
the
same
reason
that
an
automatic
shotgun
with
20
shells,
is
not
permitted
for
game
hunting.
it
is
efficient.
it's
tremendously
efficient.
it
is
so
efficient
that
we
believe
that
has
destroyed
the
fishery.
and
alaska
native
brotherhood
had
observed
that
for
years
and
years
and
years.
i
think
that
it's
important
to
understand
not
only
our
42%
of
our
fishermen
natives,
but
to
understand
that
perhaps
12%
to
15%
to
18%
of
our
population
are
of
native
blood.
this
would
be
clearly
native
blood.
i
don't
even
call
it
a
64th
or
what.
we
all
speak
english
up
there
and
we
have
no
difficulties
in
that
matter.
at
least
it
would
be
very
unusual.
i've
never
run
up
against
myself.
but
we
have
42%
of
our
fishermen.
we
have
12%
to
15%
of
our
population
that
are
of
indian
blood
or
would
be
clearly
indian.
we
have
15%
of
our
state
legislature
who
are
indians.
we
have,
the
president
of
the
state
senate,
who's
an
eskimo
and
just
as
much,
if
this
court
rules
that
kake
and
angoon
are
exempted
from
the
laws
of
this
state,
then
there
is
no
reason
why
we
will
not
lose
the
president
of
our
senate,
who
is
a
full-blooded
eskimo
and
further
removed
from
civilization
than
these
people.
we
have
--
these
people
not
only
serve
in
our
legislature,
but
they
serve
with
distinction.
these
--
we
--
we
have
the
--
the
representative
of
frank
peratrovich.
now,
these
are
common
facts
in
alaska.
it's
known.
this
is
the
climate
out
of
which
this
litigation
arises.
senator
frank
peratrovich,
a
full-blooded
indian
from
klawock.
klawock
is
organized
as
one
of
these
corporations
just
exactly
as
appellants
are
here.
senator
peratrovich
was
elected
from
the
whole
of
the
southeastern
district.
that
district
is
78%
white
and
senator
peratrovich
is
recognized
and
was
elected.
he
had
to
be
elected
by
the
whites
in
the
area,
because
he
was
a
man
regardless
of
his
race.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
think
it
will.
i
think
you'll
have
tremendous
effect
on
it,
because
we
cannot
send
--
it
--
i
have
no
right
to
predict
and
i
can't
predict,
but
it
would
not
make
sense
for
the
people
of
alaska
to
elect
to
their
state
legislature
and
make
half
of
their
fishing
--
thee
board
--
fish
and
game
board,
indians,
if
the
--
if
the
laws
to
be
passed
for
the
state
toward
apply
the
indians.
mr.
john
l.
rader
it
would
be
rather
small
on
an
overall
–
overall
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
board
traps,
i
wouldn't
take
issue
at
all
with
the
--
with
the
statement
at
metlakatla
that
would
represent
probably
less
than
1%,
that
is
for
traps.
probably,
now,
this
is
of
the
total
of
alaska.
this
is
not
southeastern
alaska,
but
at
the
total
of
alaska
pack,
probably
the
21
sites
might
amount
to
10%
of
the
southeastern
pack
and
5%
of
the
total
alaskan
pack.
but
this
is
the
problem,
there
is
no
way
to
limit
this
case
to
these
fish
traps,
because
as
someone
observed
earlier,
where
the
regulation's
general?
yes.
there
were
200
fish
trap
sites
in
alaska
or
thereabouts
open
to
every
person,
every
citizen
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
l.
rader
absolutely.
there's
no
reason
for
them,
because
these
appellants
–-
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
don't
know
what
those
categories
are.
mr.
john
l.
rader
oh.
well,
i'm
sorry
i
missed
the
thread
of
your
honor's
question.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
but
there
are
59
indian
corporations
that
are
similar
to
this.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well
--
well,
that's
true,
because
–-
mr.
john
l.
rader
oh,
yes.
it's
the
fishery.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
but
the
point
is
this
–-
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
that
is
incidentally,
that
is
a
general
regulation.
mr.
john
l.
rader
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
he'd
--
yes.
he
suggested
it
is
going
to
expand
up
to
21
fish
trap
sites.
we
have
11.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
they
are.
mr.
john
l.
rader
he
has
not
indicated
it.
mr.
john
l.
rader
if
he
has
the
authority
to
operate
to
--
now,
metlakatla's
different
because
there's
a
reservation
there.
and
we
can
argue
about
the
reservation,
but
if
he
has
the
right
on
taking
angoon,
who
incidentally
are
incorporated
cities
under
alaskan
law
and
indecently
to
whom
the
alaskan
law
has
always
applied,
marital,
criminal,
property
and
everything
else
as
far
as
we
know,
if
he
can
do
it
for
these
three
communities
on
the
basis
that
they
are
of
indian
blood,
then
he
can
do
it
with
all
the
rest
of
the
indian
communities
too.
because
these
three
communities
on
these
fish
trap
sites,
your
honor,
had
no
more
right
to
this
fish
trap
sites
that
they
are
fishing
now,
then
did
i
or
you
and
in
the
year
1958,
the
last
year
that
they
fished
under
the
general
regulations.
i
could
have
owned
the
point
(inaudible)
as
fish
trap
site.
all
i
had
to
do
was
go
out
and
take
it.
i
didn't
have
$50,000.
i
didn't
have
the
(inaudible)
i
didn't
have
the
--
the
tempers
to
make
the
fish
trap,
but
i
have
that
right.
therefore,
these
people
did
not
have
a
right
to
take
over
from
year
to
year.
it
was
a
race
every
spring,
if
you
want
to
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
those
communities
have
never
used
traps,
but
those
communities
had
the
right
to
use
traps
under
the
old
law.
mr.
john
l.
rader
up
--
up
until
we
became
a
state.
they
had
the
right
as
did
every
citizen,
to
use
traps.
they
never
exercised
that
right.
incidentally,
taking
angoon,
they
would
exert
--
exercise
any
rights
at
all
in
regard
to
fish
traps
from
1948
to
1950
respectively.
this
isn't
a
novel
longstandard
thing.
mr.
john
l.
rader
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
rader
certainly,
it
is.
you
can't
stop
it.
you
--
you
can
do
this.
you
can
limit
it
as
to
metlakatla,
because
there
is
a
reservation
there.
i
don't
know
if
it's
an
indian
reservation
or
not.
there,
indecently,
the
information
that
the
state
laws
have
just
recently
applied
to
metlakatla
is
a
great
variance
with
the
opinions
of
the
district
judges,
the
federal
district
judges
in
alaska,
in
the
case
of
united
states-booth,
the
district
judges
says,
“we
have
always
assumed
that
metlakatla
state
laws
applied
--
excuse
me,
territorial
laws
then
applied
to
metlakatla,
this
reservation."
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
there
must
be
a
reasonable
limit
to
that
because
--
because
race
--
race
alone
is
not
sufficient,
i
submit
under
indian
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
l.
rader
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
before
going
into
the
technical
legal
argument
to
place
the
case
in
its
proper
perspective,
i'd
like
to
discuss
for
just
a
moment
the
economic
hardship
that
these
appellants
have
pleaded
and
which
their
affidavits
certainly
show.
the
record,
however,
if
it's
closely
read
will,
i
think,
portray
this
situation
of
alaska
fishery.
the
affidavits
of
(inaudible)
and
those
are
the
affidavits
of
the
appellants,
show
that
five
canneries
recent
close
--
recently
closed
in
southeastern
alaska
representing
25%
of
the
productive
capacity
of
the
area.
one
affiant
stated
that
properties
that
were
valued
in
1947
at
$533,000
were
now
worth
$75,000,
cannery
properties.
the
appellant,
kake
in
here,
for
instance,
shows
that
they
paid,
or
the
federal
government
paid
for
them
$260,000
for
their
cannery
equipment
that
is
now
worth
$207,000
and
that
they
are
indebted
in
amount
of
$848,000,
which
means
this,
it
comes
through
the
record
to
you
that
they've
lost
money
at
the
rate
of
about
$100,000
a
year.
mr.
john
l.
rader
these
people
who
are
here
in
court,
angoon.
kake,
paid
$363,000.the
properties
are
worth
$377,000
and
their
total
indebtedness
is
$781,000.
in
other
words,
since
1950
to
the
time
of
those
affidavits,
they
lost
about
$700,000.
kake
did.
appellant,
metlakatla,
i
don't
believe
gives
us
the
detail
on
their
financial
picture
like
kake
and
angoon
due
their
--
their
financial
situation
is
not
nearly
as
serious
certainly
as
--
as
kake's
and
angoon's.
but
what
we
have
as
a
result
of
the
depleted
industry
is,
we
--
we
have
something
that,
to
me
is
like
the
dust
bowl.
it
is
the
resource
of
the
region
and
probably,
if
there
was
any
material
factor
that
--
that
had
as
much
to
do
with
statehood,
the
--
the
most
material
factor.
i
mean,
of
the
wealth
or
the
way
the
people
live
of
alaska
when
their
quest
for
statehood
was
to
control
this
fishery
upon
which
we
--
we
have
--
we
had
to
have
it,
and
it
had
been
exclusively
under
the
federal
control
and
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
disaster.
the
southeast
--
the
economy
of
southeastern
alaska
was
in
a
disastrous
situation
and
everyone
including
these
appellants,
when
they
voted
for
ordinance
3
of
the
constitution,
when
they
voted
in
the
referendum
in
1948,
voted
overwhelmingly
for
the
abolition
of
the
fish
trap
to
which
we
--
and
our
position
is
that
we,
the
state,
the
son
have
watched
our
parent,
the
united
states,
in
the
control
of
this
fishery,
and
maybe
we
can't
do
any
better.
but
our
position
is,
we
have
a
right
to
try
and
if
that's
what
statehood
gave
us,
was
the
right
to
try.
and
that
these
appellants
must
try
with
us
whether
they
want
to
or
not
at
this
time
because
at
one
time,
they
were
certainly
willing.
and
the
reason
really
that
this
--
this
moved
to
abolish
the
fish
traps
are
--
was
led
by
appellant
communities
and
others
just
exactly
like
them
is
because
that
was
not
their
way
of
fishing.
mr.
john
l.
rader
to
begin
with,
your
honor,
section
4
is
a
compact
and
it
is
gross
error
to
rely
upon
the
interpretation
of
section
4
by
merely
congressional
intent.
if
this
was
a
compact,
and
that's
what
it
says
it
is,
then
our
understanding
of
that
compact
in
--
for
the
purposes
of
interpreting
that
contract
--
compact
today
is
just
as
important
as
was
congress'
intent.
our
understanding
of
it
was
this.
there
are
fish
wheels
on
the
yukon
river.
there
are
reservations
in
alaska.
there's
a
(inaudible)
indian
reservation.
there
may
be
some
fishing
right.
we
don't
know.
congress
didn't
know,
and
congress
did
not
want
to
do
this.
in
--
in
the
issue
of
statehood,
they
did
not
want
to
attempt
to
neither
enlarge
nor
diminish
whatever
those
rights
might
be.
we
understood
it,
that
it
would
be
if
someone
could
come
in
here
and
show
a
property
right
to
the
common
fisheries
that
they
would
have
it
and
we
would
no
longer
own
it,
but
we
construe
section
4
to
be
a
disclaimer
of
property
interest,
not
a
disclaimer
of
state
police
power
over
our
citizens
when
they
start
to
fish.
we
thought
that
it
was
--
a
boat
is
a
property
right,
a
fishing
area
in
our
fishery
is
not
a
property
right.
it
can
neither
be
bought
nor
sold.
that
was
open
to
all
citizens
and
all
citizens
alike.
a
fish
trap
is
a
device.
it's
made
out
of
--
of
poles
and
wires
and
houses.
it
has
a
house
on
it,
for
the
watchman.
that
is
a
property
right,
but
there
was
no
ever
a
property
right
to
a
fish
trap
site
or
location
in
the
common
fishery,
and
this
court
held
that
in
hynes
versus
grimes.
now,
there
are
fish
wheels
on
the
yukon
river.
there
are
international
treaties
which
give
the
natives
of
alaska
the
right
to
engage
in
--
in
sealing,
pelagic
sealing.
they
call
it
fishing
sometimes.
sometimes
they
call
it
hunting.
those
might
be
rights,
but
congress
did
not
want
to
concern
itself
with
those
rights
or
anything
else,
and
so
it
said
including
fishing
rights,
and
it
should
have
said,
“if
any,”
because
that's
what
it
means
that
we
disclaim
any
right
title
and
interest
inany
property,
including
fishing
rights.
that,
you
can't
disclaim
right
title
and
interest
to
an
indian
when
he's
fishing.
those
are
citizens.
that's
essential
to
our
sovereignty.
it's
the
biggest
part
of
our
--
of
--
our
biggest
resource.
although
we
could
give
away
property,
we
cannot
give
away
sovereignty
and
then
we
say
this.
that
if,
as
a
condition
of
admission
to
the
union,
we
did
cede
sovereignty
over
our
citizens
on
the
basis
of
race,
then
that
was
an
unfair
exaction
and
it
was
an
exaction
as
a
condition
to
admitting
as
to
statehood
that
violates
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
because
there's
no
other
state
in
the
union
that
where
such
a
principle
is
recognized.
and
i
don't
believe
you
can
find
any
other
statehood
act
where
it
says,
“including
fishing
rights.”
therefore,
congress
said
this,
“we
will
leave
that
to
future
legislation
or
judicial
determination.”
that's
what
the
--
that's
what
the
appellants
are
doing
here
today.
they
came
--
they're
coming
in
here
to
attempt
to
establish
a
property
right
in
this
court,
as
congress
contemplated
that
they
should,
but
that
should
not
be
taken
by
this
court
to
mean
that
such
a
property
right
exist.
they
have
not
--
excuse
me.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
was
going
to
say,
there
has
been
no
pleading
of
aboriginal
rights
here.
those
are
not
pleaded.
they
--
they
plead
only
a
right
to
fish
under
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well
on
a
reservation,
i
think
that
they
could
perhaps.
in
the
case
of
tulee
versus
washington,
there
was
a
treaty
and
the
treaty
provided
that
not
only
were
the
indians
involved
in
that
case
have
the
right
to
fish
exclusively
the
waters
on
their
reservation,
but
that
they
would
have
the
further
--
and
this
is
a
treaty
right
--
to
fish
in
all
usual
and
accustomed
places
that
they
had
previously
fished
and
that
took
them
beyond
the
reservation,
it
took
them
into
the
common
fishery,
and
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
they
could
not
be
charged
a
license
fee
because
the
license
fee
was
not
merely
for
purposes
of
regulation,
it
was
also
for
purposes
of
taxation.
does
that
answer
your
honor's
question?
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
don't
believe
so
for
this
reason.
this
case
does
not
present
a
factual
situation
which
would
--
which
would
permit
you
to
reach
that
point
except
by
dictum,
because
in
kake
and
angoon,
there
is
nothing
even
resembling
a
reservation.
on
metlakatla,
there
is
a
reservation
and
i
--
i
can't
tell
whether
it's
an
indian
reservation
or
not.
but
it
was
a
reservation
set
aside
for
the
immigrants
who
called
themselves
the
metlakatlan
indians
who
came
to
metlakatla
to
be
administered
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states.
i
--
i
don't
--
certainly,
the
indian
--
inland
waters
of
the
state,
and
that's
where
we
get
to
our
equal
footing
doctrine
and
i
would
come
to
that
in
a
few
minutes.
there
is
not
--
there
is
no
problem
there.
so
the
upland
reservation
problem
that
would
--
could
be
created
by
this
case
as
applied
to
other
reservations,
it
just
isn't
in
this
case,
i
don't
believe.
mr.
john
l.
rader
very
well.
mr.
john
l.
rader
totally,
except
there
are
--
there's
only
two
claims
that
these
people
make.
they
have
refused
to
pay
the
raw
fish
tax
of
the
territory
on
their
cannery
and
they
refused
to
abide
by
a
constitutional
ordinance,
abolishing
fish
traps.
mr.
john
l.
rader
other
than
that
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
sir.
and
it
applied
there
before
the
1953
and
1957
statute
that
was
cited
to
you
by
a
counsel
for
metlakatla.
the
district
judge
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
booth
stated,
“it
has
always
been
assumed
that
the
territorial
law
applied
to
metlakatla,
and
it
has
always
been
assumed
that
they
have
applied.”
and
the
reasoning
of
united
states
verus
sandoval,
in
cases
of
that
nature,
is
absolutely
inapplicable
here,
because
those
people
there
have
their
own
system
of
government.
they
were
never
brought
under
the
--
the
laws
of
the
state.
there
had
been
a
reluctance
of
the
state
to
govern
those
persons
because
they
couldn't
pay
their
own
way,
so
to
speak,
in
a
government
sense.
their
worst
enemies,
of
the
tribes,
were
the
pioneers
and
the
settlers
who
--
who
settled
in
amidst
them
and
--
and
adjacent
to
them.
that's
not
true
here.
all
of
that
reasoning,
of
that
--
of
those
cases,
in
fact,
the
whole
intent
of
the
federal
indian
law,
which
of
course
is
wonderful
in
its
concept,
becomes
to
be
--
it
--
it
comes
to
be
a
--
to
work
against
itself
in
a
most
destructive
manner
in
this
case
because
these
people
are
not
our
enemies
in
alaska.
these
people,
the
--
the
argument
in
the
state
senate
as
to
who
was
going
to
be
president
of
the
senate
was
between
an
eskimo
and
an
indian.
mr.
john
l.
rader
we
honor
them
and
we
respect
them.
mr.
john
l.
rader
once
--
once
the
tribal
organization
has
dissolved,
once
the
elements
of
sovereignty
have
been
lost
and
once
the
indians
who
are
indians
today
only
by
race
and
once
they
have
--
have
become
a
part
of
our
government,
have
incorporated
into
our
cities,
have
thrown
out
tribal
organization
for
municipal
law,
the
state
municipal
law,
then
the
united
states
government
through
the
department
of
interior
cannot
go
in
and
segregate
those
people
out
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
right
to
come
to
this
court
as
they're
doing
today
and
the
right
of
congress
to
withdraw
the
wardship
relation
that
it
has
with
other
indians
in
alaska
at
will
without
having
to
be
--
that
without
having
to
pay
for
it.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
well
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
to
begin
with,
congress
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
legislative
history
does
not
show
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
rader
no.
that
they
did
not
know
if
there
were
any
such
things
as
indian
fishing
rights,
and
they
did
not
want
to
either
destroy
it
or
create
them
in
the
act
of
admission.
they
wanted
to
preserve
the
status
quo
and
the
status
quo
in
the
--
in
the
commercial
fishery
of
alaska
is
equality
of
citizens
and
it
has
been,
for
as
long
as
anyone
knows,
there
has
never
been
a
distinction
made
on
a
basis
of
race.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
secretary
of
interior
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
--
the
secretary
of
interior
would
deny
that
fish
traps
were
a
conservation
issue.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
secretary
of
interior
has
denied
that
they
are
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
a
conservation
issue.
we
point
to
one
fact
and
that
is
the
fact
that
under
his
management,
the
fisheries
have
practically
been
destroyed
and
we
contest
the
validity
of
his
statement
that
fish
traps
are
not
a
conservation
issue.
and
we
think
that
now
that
we
are
a
state,
that
we
have
the
right
to
try
it.
maybe
we
will
have
neither
the
will
to
conserve
nor
the
ability
to
conserve.
but
we
know
that
under
federal
management,
it
has
not
been
conserved.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
rader
they
have
always
maintained
that
they
could
not
abolish
fish
traps
on
the
basis
of
conservation.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
people
of
alaska
have
always
maintained
that
that's
what's
destroying
the
industry
and
i
think
the
facts
--
we
may
not
be
right,
but
the
facts
prove
conclusively
that
--
that
their
analysis
of
the
conversation
picture
is
not
altogether
correct
either.
mr.
john
l.
rader
it
goes
back,
if
it
please
the
court,
from
the
time
the
united
states
purchased
alaska
from
russia.
the
united
states
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
united
states
ignored
the
alaska
fisheries
for
60
or
80
years
and
it
was
a
--
a
matter
of
people
coming
in
harvesting
the
crop
in
any
manner
that
they
wanted
to
and
people
going
out.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
don't
know
except
that
alaskans,
natives
and
whites
alike
would
have
maybe
25
or
30
years.
every
time
we
have
a
legislature
up
there,
we
memorialized
congress
to
abolish
these
devices
and
the
alaska
native
brotherhood
every
time
they
meet
in
a
convention,
pass
a
resolution
addressed
to
or
delegate
to
congress
to
do
something
to
abolish
these
fish
traps
and
no
one
has
ever
done
it,
and
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
that
goes
back
30
or
40
years.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that
is
correct.
this
is
the
thing
about
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
perhaps
that's
true.
but
here,
you
have
--
you
have
a
device
which
is
--
which
has
a
capacity
to
perhaps
catch
$25,000
worth
of
fish
in
a
day.
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
have
a
man
on
that
--
on
that
fish
trap
when
the
airplanes
are
gone
and
when
the
boats
are
gone,
and
you
can
see
in
50
miles
in
each
direction,
is
to
open
it
up
and
let
it
fish.
and
you
can't
tell
when
you
--
when
you
--
if
you
close
it
up,
stop
the
fishing
when
you
see
a
boat
or
an
airplane
coming,
you
can't
tell
how
long
the
fish
have
been
in
the
pot
or
in
the
heart.
they're
there,
they're
alive
and
they
have
been
caught
when
the
season
was
open.
it
is
such
a
tremendous
device
that
the
abuse
is
--
is
so
easily
accomplished.
now,
that's
true
of
the
nets
also.
a
fisherman
that
gets
hungry,
when
he
watches
a
fish
trap
operate,
and
he
finds
out
that
his
hours
have
been
closed,
that
his
days
have
been
closed,
that
he
cannot
fish
and
he
wants
his
fish
trap
to
operate,
he's
pretty
tempted
also
to
take
his
nets
and
go
off
and
throw
them
across
the
stream
and
that
is
destructive,
equally.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
not
by
the
indians.
this
is
not
their
method
of
--
the
--
this
is
a
device
and
contrivance
has
been
brought
in
with
steam-powered
tugs
and
things
like
that.
these
indians
could
not
set
up
their
own
fish
traps.
these
fish
traps
are
put
in
place
for
these
indians
by
the
whiz
fish
company
in
the
case
before
you
today,
hired
out
of
seattle
with
their
large
equipment
to
come
up
and
install
this
fish
trap
device.
these
things
are
monstrous.
they're
beyond
the
capacity
of
--
of
the
union
villagers
to
construct.
they're
not
a
hand-constructed
type
of
thing
and
they
are
not
--
their
historic
way
of
fishing.
and
that
was
really
the
reason,
probably,
that
the
indians
so
thoroughly
opposed
with
the
rest
of
the
people
who
lived
in
alaska
the
use
of
the
fish
trap
because
it
was
a
device
which
was
so
efficient
that
it
was
--
we
believe,
whether
the
secretary
of
interior
does
or
doesn't,
we
believe
that
it's
destroying
the
fisheries.
mr.
john
l.
rader
they
have
a
cannery.
now,
i
can't
be
too
certain
about
metlakatla,
but
let
me
take
kake
and
angoon.
mr.
john
l.
rader
are
--
are
a
seattle
--
a
seattle
concern
that
comes
in
and
operates
a
cannery
for
them
and
takes
a
--
in
some
instances,
it's
a
percent
of
the
pack
or
something
of
that
nature,
but
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
a
native
enterprise.
mr.
john
l.
rader
it's
--
it's
a
big
business.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
buildings
and
the
--
and
the
complete
operation
were
purchased
from
ordinary,
a
normal
businessman
made
in
alaska.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
right.
the
--
i
think
the
transaction
is
indicated
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
affidavits,
is
that
the
united
states
bought
from
a
pack
from
two
packing
companies.
their
complete
packing
operation,
canneries,
boats,
equipment,
fish
traps
and
fish
trap
sites
it
says,
the
title
was
taken
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
in
trust
for
these
corporations
which
have
been
organized
by
the
department
of
interior.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
metlakatla
has
been
operating
since
1915
and
i
don't
know
whether
that
was
out
of
their
own
funds
or
whether
it
was
loaned,
but
i
do
believe
it's
been
paid
off.
the
metlakatla
fishery
has
been
successful,
partly
because
they
got
into
the
business
before
it
was
dust
bowl.
they
--
they've
been
into
it
back
when
it
was
good,
1915.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
they
--
they
used
fish
traps
in
1915.
in
fact,
aboriginally,
the
metlakatlans
in
canada
used
a
--
something
like
a
fish
trap,
i
guess.
it
was
a
small
device,
but
i've
been
told
that
the
word
“metlakatla”
means
“fish
trap
people”
for
metlakatla
in
canada.
however,
that
was
--
that's
--
as
much
a
--
the
same
as
a
fly
is
to
a
horse
to
what
we're
talking
about
today,
the
type
of
devices
they
had.
mr.
john
l.
rader
no,
your
honor,
that
was
on
kake
and
angoon.
mr.
john
l.
rader
in
both
of
those,
i
gave
you
the
figures
on
them.
i
did
not
have
the
figures
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
on
metlakatla.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
believe
the
metlakatlans
all
financially
is
in
a
much
better
position
than
these
other
people
because
as
i
say,
they
got
into
business
when
it
was
--
when
the
resource
was
there.
mr.
john
l.
rader
they
packed
their
own,
i
believe.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
believe
they
do,
and
then
their
pack
was
sold.
i
mean,
then
--
then
it
is
taken
to
seattle,
financial
arrangements
are
made
for
a
broker,
through
a
broker
and
the
fish
are
sold
on
a
national
scale,
alaska
salmon.
as
long
as
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
no.
no,
they
don't.
i
believe
that
they
packed
under
their
own
--
with
their
own
managers,
their
own
people
operating
it.
the
operation
is
too
new
to
kake
and
angoon,
the
business
--
the
business
operation.
the
--
after
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
excuse
me.
mr.
john
l.
rader
only
these
three.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
all
they
have
claimed
thus
far.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
right,
these
three
for
fish
traps.
mr.
john
l.
rader
no,
i
think
that
if
they
can
--
if
they
can
do
what
they've
done
here,
they
completely
control
the
fishery,
so
far
as
an
indian
is
concerned,
when
he
starts
to
fish
any
place.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
think
that
will
become
clear
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
presume
not,
that's
indian
fishing.
a
trap
is
as
foreign
as
anything
else.
that's
not
their
method
of
fishing.
they're
fishermen
in
boats
and
skiffs.
why
shouldn't
it
be
with
a
hook
and
line?
it's
an
indian
fishing
right.
they
have
the
right
to
fish
with
a
hook
and
line
before,
why
don't
they
have
the
right
to
fish
with
a
hook
and
line
now?
they
had
just
as
much
right
to
fish
with
a
fish
trap
before
as
they
do
now,
but
before,
they
never
had
a
right
to
fish
with
a
fish
trap
because
that
was
a
right
that
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
had.
perhaps
that'll
become
more
clear
if
you'll
--
if
i
may
summarize
my
--
my
legal
argument
and
go
back
to
the
first
point
of
it,
which
is
that
point.
briefly,
we
state
this.
number
one,
prior
to
statehood,
in
the
commercial
fishery
--
now,
we're
not
talking
about
a
subsistence
fishery.
perhaps
that's
what
they
meant
by
indian
fishing
rights,
a
subsistence
fishery,
to
catch
fish
and
feed
it
to
yourself
and
your
dogs
along
the
yukon
river,
up
north
some
place
or
maybe
in
this
area
too,
but
we're
talking
about
the
commercial
fishery.
number
one
is,
before
statehood,
there
was
never
any
right
in
any
person
to
an
exclusive
right
of
privilege
to
the
commercial
fish
--
fishery,
and
that
included
indians,
aleuts,
eskimos,
whites,
swedes,
englishmen
and
irishmen.
it
included
everybody.
they
were
all
legal.
we
come
into
the
union
and
we
have
section
4,
which
says
that
the
state
will
disclaim
all
right
to
have
an
interest
to
any
property
including
a
fishing
right.
we
contend
that
their
wording
actually
is
that
we
--
we
disclaim
right
to
have
an
interest
to
a
fishing
right
if
any,
and
there
may
be
some.
and
this
court
cannot
possibly
foreclose
that
today
because
you
don't
have
all
the
fishing
rights
in
alaska
before
you
today.
you
have
only
the
fishing
right
today
in
this
case
as
it
pertains
to
a
fish
trap.
that's
the
narrowest
issue
of
this
case.
and
we
say
that
congress
did
not
intend
as
to
change
the
status
quo,
that
the
white
act,
if
it
please
the
court,
which
was
to
prevent
discrimination
did
not
now
become
the
instrument
of
discrimination
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
is,
a
compete
perversion
of
an
act
of
congress
which
was
passed
to
prevent
any
exclusive
right
or
privilege
in
the
common
fishery
of
alaska.
and
as
this
court
observed
in
hynes
versus
grimes,
it
should
be
open
to
all
of
our
citizens
when
it
was
attempted
there
to
set
aside
for
any
group
of
indians.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
our
standing
brings
us
to
the
next
point.
that
if
we're
wrong
in
the
first
two,
if
there
is
a
property
right
and
if
we
did
disclaim
it
and
if
we
did
disclaim
not
only
a
property
right,
but
the
right
to
regulate
our
citizens
on
the
basis
of
race,
then
we
say
that
if
you
violated
the
equal
footing
because
the
inland
waters
and
the
fish
and
game
were
held
in
trust
for
the
future
state
of
alaska
that
by
operation
of
law,
it
passed
to
alaska
and
that
this
is
an
unwarranted
infringement
by
an
arm
of
the
federal
government
into
our
sovereignty.
mr.
john
l.
rader
it's
police
power
and
sovereignty,
if
we're
wrong
on
the
first
two.
mr.
john
l.
rader
no,
we
wouldn't
for
this
reason.
and
that
is
if
--
if
you're
going
to
withhold
from
the
state
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control,
you
must
define
that,
because
normally,
this
--
that
was
the
question
that
was
raised
this
morning
as
how
--
how
can
the
state
argue
about
the
rights
as
between
the
federal
government
and
the
indians?
the
reason
that
we
have
a
right
to
argue
about
that
is
because
it's
our
property
you're
arguing
about,
the
fish
and
game
and
the
resource
of
alaska.
and
we
say
this.
if
you
made
an
indian
reservation
out
of
all
of
the
inland
waters
of
alaska
and
took
from
alaska
the
resource
which
represents
85%
of
the
natural
resources
harvested
as
a
condition
of
entry
into
the
union,
then
you
will
have
violated
the
equal
standing
of
alaska
with
washington,
oregon,
the
original
13
states
and
the
rest
of
the
states
of
the
union.
mr.
john
l.
rader
if
you
would
draw
on
reservation,
it
would.
mr.
john
l.
rader
if
you
--
if
you
would
draw
a
line
and
say
that
that's
the
area
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
no.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
who
did
that?
the
secretary
of
interior
did
that
after
statehood,
not
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
metlakatla
reservation.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
might
--
i
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i
--
i
went
to
the
1960
regulations
because
that's
where
the
lines
are
drawn
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
as
we
have
gone
on
one
--
one
of
our
appendices
and
that
was
done
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
by
the
secretary.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
metlakatla.
mr.
john
l.
rader
alright.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
think
you
could
do
that.
mr.
john
l.
rader
you
cannot
do
it
into
the
inland
waters.
the
united
states
holds
the
uplands
as
the
owner
and
out
of
the
uplands,
the
united
states
may
create
a
reservation
for
indians
and
make
it
exclusive
and
have
absolute
jurisdiction
control
or
anything
else
that
they
want
to,
but
they
cannot
state
that
an
indian,
when
he
starts
to
fish
any
place
in
alaska,
is
withdrawn
from
our
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
the
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
on
metlakatla.
on
the
metlakatlan
islands.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
they
have
on
kake
and
angoon,
they've
said
“any
place
in
alaska.”
on
metlakatla,
they
said
“within
the
reservation”
that
has
been
previously
defined
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
that
they
will
permit
these
fish
traps.
mr.
john
l.
rader
alright.
then
on
--
for
metlakatla,
we
would
retreat
to
this
position
and
that
is
that
metlakatla,
although
it
perhaps
had
the
exclusive
right
to
use
an
area,
in
other
words,
“no
one
can
fish
in
my
pond
except
me.”
mr.
john
l.
rader
it
is
an
exclusive
right,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
have
ever
been
segregated
out
of
the
general
conservation
scheme
of
the
white
act
when
it
was
administered
by
the
united
states
nor
the
--
nor
the
acts
of
the
state
of
alaska.
in
other
words,
although
i
may
own
a
pond
or
may
own
a
cornfield
and
there's
migratory
birds
come
and
land
on
it
and
no
one
else
can
trespass
on
my
property
and
fish
my
area,
i
am
still
bound
by
the
fish
and
game
laws
of
the
state
as
to
when
i
can
shoot
those
migratory
birds
and
we
take
the
position
that
they
are
bound
to
the
laws
of
the
state
as
to
when
they
can
take
these
migratory
fish
when
it
passes
through
their
reservation.
and
that
that
could
not
be
withheld
from
the
state
because
it's
something
that
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
they're
obeying
all
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
rader
excuse
me.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
because
this
is
the
inland
waters,
this
is
the
fish
and
game
of
alaska.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
think
that
there's
a
distinction.
united
states
never
held
the
uplands
entrust
for
the
state,
but
the
united
states
has
always
upheld
the
inland
waters
entrust
for
the
state.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
your
honor.
and
--
and
although
they
could
--
could
do
whatever
they
wanted
to
at
the
uplands,
we
don't
think
that
they
had
the
right
to
segregate
out
the
inland
waters
and
the
fish
and
game
resource
because
that
is
not
--
it
used
to
be
thought
that
the
state
owned
the
fish
and
game
resource.
that
idea
has
been
read
or
abandoned
to
say
that,
“no,
the
state
has
a
part
of
the
sovereignty,
police
power,
has
the
right
to
control
and
conserve
the
fish
and
game
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
people
of
the
state.”
and
we
don't
think
congress
intended
to
do
any
such
thing.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
--
i
missed
the
first
part.
mr.
john
l.
rader
united
states?
mr.
john
l.
rader
by
treaty?
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
and
we
--
and
if
the
united
states
would
say
this.
that
the
salmon
resource
of
alaska
is
so
colored
with
international
matters
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
it
please
the
court,
it
may
be.
mr.
john
l.
rader
it
may
come
to
do
that,
that's
right,
because
of
the
japanese
fishery
and
the
russian
fishery
on
the
high
seas.
when
united
states
comes
to
--
to
that
point
and
says
by
treaty,
“we're
going
to
reenter
and
control
alaska's
fisheries,”
they
will
and
they
--
and
they
must.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well
that's
the
only
way
that
they
can
do
it.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
we
needn't
destroy
the
purported
reservation
of
inland
waters,
the
3000
feet
presidential
proclamation.
we
--
we
have
argued
that
that
was
destroyed,
but
we
needn't
destroy
that.
we
needn't
reach
that
point
in
this
case
actually
because
the
presidential
proclamation
--
remember
the
statue
that
set
aside
the
metlakatla
reservation,
speaks
of
the
body
of
lands
known
as
annette
islands.
this
court
interpreted
it
in
alaska
pacific
fisheries
case
to
say,
“well,
these
lands
were
no
good
to
these
people,
they
are
seafaring
people
without
some
waters.”
and
--
but
you
did
not
adopt
the
presidential
proclamation
which
said
that
--
in
the
--
of
1916,
which
said
that
there
would
be
3000
feet
around
the
lands.
you
did
not
adopt
it,
but
you
did
not
reject
it
either.
you
just
refused
to
dignify
it
and
held
on
a
different
grounds,
although
the
circuit
court
went
off
on
that
grounds
completely.
now,
under
the
presidential
proclamation,
the
--
it
states
that
they
shall
have
the
exclusive
right
to
fish
this
area
subject
to
the
general
fisheries
laws
of
the
united
states.
at
that
time,
the
united
states
held
a
municipal
jurisdiction,
as
this
court
observed
in
hynes
versus
grimes,
held
not
only
federal
jurisdiction
but
you
held
municipal
jurisdiction.
you
held
a
jurisdiction
to
control
fish
and
game
of
alaska
because
there
was
no
state
there,
and
because
it
had
been
withheld
from
the
territorial
government.
you
held
both
municipal
and
federal
jurisdiction.
we
argue
that
when
by
operation
of
law,
when
municipal
jurisdiction
over
fish
and
game
and
over
the
inland
waters
comes
to
the
state
when
the
state
is
created
that
those
are
the
general
fisheries
laws.
and
if
you
want
to
look
at
the
status
quo,
if
there's
one
thing
the
congress
did
by
section
4,
it
said,
“we
want
to
reserve
the
status
quo.”
that's
the
reason
that
we
weren't
worried
about
it.
the
status
quo
was
that
everybody
fished
as
equal
under
the
general
conservation
laws.
we
have
always
disagreed
with
the
department
of
interior
as
to
what
conservation
is.
but
i
don't
think
this
court
will
argue
with
us
what
we
think
conservation
is
because
i
think
that's
our
determination
and
the
appellant,
metlakatla,
has
admitted
that
the
--
the
reason
for
banning
was
for
conservation
purposes.
now,
we
argue
that,
although
as
--
with
any
migratory
resource,
if
you're
going
to
give
someone
exclusive
right
to
fish,
if
you're
going
to
give
them
80
acres
and
say
no
one
else
can
trespass
on
this
area,
to
shoot
birds
or
anything
else,
if
you
want
to
give
them
80
acres
of
water
and
say
no
one
else
can
fish
there,
that's
all
right.
we
really
aren't
trying
to
knock
out
that
reservation
unless
as
a
last
resort,
we
have
to.
but
we
say
this
that
giving
them
the
exclusive
right
to
fish
under
the
general
fisheries
laws
of
united
states,
which
are
now
the
general
fisheries
laws
of
alaska,
the
only
reason
you
made
general
fisheries
laws
up
there
is
because
you
exercised
the
powers
of
a
state
government
in
that
area,
there
was
no
state
government.
now,
there
is
a
state
government.
and
the
control
of
a
migratory
resource
as
this
court
observed
in
dow
versus
ickes
means
nothing,
means
nothing.
and
this
was
a
fish
trap
case,
dow
versus
ickes.
it
means
nothing
unless
it
work
--
works
to
the
final
end
of
conservation
and
you
don't
have
a
--
and
you
don't
have
a
conservation
chain
with
a
reservation
in
the
middle
of
it
that
--
that
reaps
the
fruits
of
conservation.
you
can
use
dynamite
and
dynamites
are
the
most
effective
way
there
is
to
fish.
if
you
really
want
to
catch
fish,
dynamite.
that's
even
more
efficient
than
a
fish
trap.
but
they've
always
said,
“no".
this
is
a
migratory
resource.
it
has
to
be
controlled
as
a
migratory
resource.
it
has
to
be
followed
from
the
spawning
streams,
in
the
hills
to
the
high
seas.”
and
our
argument
is,
that
metlakatla,
with
the
exclusive
right
to
use
this
area
did
not
have
and
does
not
have
the
right,
the
unregulated
right
to
fish.
now,
by
that,
i
mean
to
violate
the
state
laws
and
follow
the
secretary
of
interior's
laws.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
applicable
to
a
stream.
i
don't
know,
but
i
think
it's
applicable
to
the
inland
waters.
mr.
john
l.
rader
they're
not
a
stream,
the
inland
waters
of
the
state.
this
is
an
island
and
it's
surrounded
by
waters
of
metlakatla.
in
fact,
all
of
these
are
on
islands.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
government,
you
--
you
have
to
assume
that
--
that
they
wanted
to
make
a
decision
at
that
time
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
fishing
rights.
the
government
did
not
want
to
make
that
decision.
the
congress
did
not
want
to
make
that
decision.
and
the
--
the
legislative
history
is
this.
that
we
neither
enlarge
nor
destroy
whatever
these
rights
may
be
if
any,
and
there
may
be
some
rights
in
other
areas.
but
today,
we're
arguing
about
the
commercial
fishery
and
we're
arguing
about
corporations
that
have
used
fish
traps
for
12
years
and
in
the
case
of
327
and
since
1915
in
the
other
case.
it
may
mean
something
some
place
else.
the
act
said,
“we'll
leave
this
to
future
legislative
and
judicial
determination.”
and
i
think
that
--
that
the
fact
that
they
say
there
may
be
a
right
and
now,
these
appellants
are
claiming
it,
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
a
right
because
they
cannot
point
to
a
grant
or
recognition
by
congress
of
fishing
rights,
any
place.
and
this
act
was
intended
to
preserve
the
status
quo
to
neither
augment
nor
diminish
the
fishing
rights
of
the
unions.
now,
it
--
it
may
have
in
some
other
--
in
some
other
area
and
in
some
other
device,
it
--
it
may
have
as
a
different
meaning.
but
in
the
commercial
fishery
to
where
everybody
had
an
equal
right
to
these
fish
trap
sites
just
like
they
have
a
right
to
go
out
and
fish
at
a
certain
spot
if
they
get
there
first.
there
was
no
right
to
carry
it
over
and
so
when
we
say
this
is
a
compact,
and
i
insist
that
the
intent
of
the
state
and
the
understanding
of
the
state
must
be
considered
by
this
court,
as
well
as
the
intent
of
congress.
and
when
they
say
the
status
quo,
and
we
know
the
status
quo
in
the
common
fishery
to
be
this,
equality,
the
right
of
all
citizens
that
it
has
always
been
administered
under
the
white
act
by
the
secretary
of
interior.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
i
--
i
departed
so
far
from
my
prepared
argument.
yes,
i
--
i
--
i'd
be
very
happy
though
to
answer
any
question
i
can
right
now.
mr.
john
l.
rader
our
first
point
as
i've
said
was
the
freedom
in
the
fishery,
no
right.
these
people
must
prove
a
property
right
that
existed
before
statehood
because
if
the
status
quo
was
preserved,
that's
what
had
to
be
preserved.
the
second
one
is
the
analysis
of
section
4.
if
we
would
--
if
we
could
turn
to
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
no.
mr.
john
l.
rader
we
--
we've
conceded
that.
mr.
john
l.
rader
we
were
in
error
in
our
earlier
affairs.
mr.
john
l.
rader
incidentally,
i
think
--
before
i
turn
the
jurisdiction
problem,
if
you'll
permit
me
just
to
make
one
observation.
and
that
is
this.
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
the
jurisdictional
act,
which
gave
rise
to
the
--
to
the
tlingit
and
haida
indians
of
alaska
versus
united
states,
has
recognized
that
all
of
the
indians
of
alaska,
aboriginal
indians
of
--
of
southeastern
alaska,
and
that's
the
area
we're
herewith
concerned,
may
present
their
claim
to
the
court
of
claims,
and
if
they'll
be
compensated
for
whatever
they
lost,
including
fishing
rights.
and
the
court
of
claims
has
so
ruled
because
truly,
whatever
rights
they
once
must
have,
they
were
lost
now.
and
the
court
of
claims
has
ruled
that
the
most
valuable
asset
lost
to
the
aboriginal
indians
of
--
of
southeastern
alaska
was
their
fishing
right.
and
the
scheme
becomes
apparent.
of
congress,
the
scheme
was
to
compensate
these
people
for
the
fishing
right
they
lost
because
it
was
opened
up
to
all
citizens
of
alaska
--
of
the
united
states
equally,
and
it
had
been
pretty
well
diminished.
they
have
the
rights
of
any
other
citizens
now
but
they
no
longer
have
the
exclusive
right
or
special
privilege
or
anything
else
because
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
to
what?
property?
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
correct.
but
disclaiming
property
rights
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
not
true.
we
have
people
there
from
every
state
in
the
union,
but
the
tenor
of
alaska
is,
is
racial
equality.
mr.
john
l.
rader
but
it's
a
property
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
there
was
one
thing
that
we
--
and
this
is
the
only
thing
that
we
have
to
show,
i
think,
in
this
litigation
is
that
we
did
not
disclaimed
jurisdiction
over
our
citizens
when
they
begin
to
fish
on
the
basis
of
race.
if
we
can
disclaim
property
and
section
4
was
a
disclaimer
of
property
right,
but
we're
talking
about
sovereignty
and
we're
talking
about
our
citizens.
mr.
john
l.
rader
for
these
appellants
perhaps,
there
may
be
others
who
have
a
property
right.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
it
is
destroyed.
that
admirable
faith
is
destroyed,
unless
--
unless
we're
correcting
this.
mr.
john
l.
rader
but
must
not
that
principle
be
limited
to
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
principle
because
this
is
what
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
there
are
citizens
too.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
how
was
that
guardianship
expressed?
if
we
look
at
the
--
if
we
look
at
--
united
states
versus
kagama,
and
look
at
the
test
of
--
of
when
the
united
states
will
extend
itself
to
the
protection
of
wards
and
consider
the
--
the
indians
to
be
wards.
if
we
look
at
those
tests,
these
people
don't
need
it.
and
--
and
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
interior
decides
that
they
may
or
may
not
need
it
when
--
when
it
--
when
the
consequence
of
that
is
to
deprive
of
--
us
of
our
sovereignty,
we
think
we
have
a
right
to
contest
it.
here,
these
appellants
are
business
corporations.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
state
schools.
mr.
john
l.
rader
state
schools.
mr.
john
l.
rader
they
were
federal.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
think
that
the
united
states
--
actually,
the
white
folk
have
been
wards
of
the
united
states
too.
the
--
the
territory
has
been
treated
very
differently
in
a
public
health
and
in
a
great
different
--
great
many
matters.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
in
19
--
whenever
they
formed
their
corporations
and
he
loaned
them
money,
that
was
a
different
treatment
than
it
was
for
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
for
white
communities.
mr.
john
l.
rader
no.
mr.
john
l.
rader
they've
had
dealings.
they've
had
--
it's
a
corporation,
but
we
insist
this.
that
the
power
of
the
united
states
--
we
have
two
powers
here
and
it's
hard
to
tell
what
power
they
were
exercising
when
we
were
a
territory.
they
had
the
plenary
power
to
govern
the
territory
regardless
of
indian
tribes
or
anything
else.
they
could
have
taken
a
community
of
swedes.
and
--
and
the
united
states
could
have
and
organized
and
loaned
them
money
in
the
corporations
for
business
purposes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow.
we
have
59
indian
corporations.
the
instructions
of
the
secretary
of
interior
are
that
they
can
be
formed
in
juneau.
they
can
be
formed
in
anchorage.
if
all
you
have
to
do
is
be
of
indian
blood
and
have
a
common
bond
of
residence
or
occupation
to
form
--
to
be
in
one
of
these
corporations.
well,
that's
all
you
have
to
do.
and
i
--
and
i
--
i
can',
for
the
light
of
me,
believe
that
that
and
that
alone
would
be
enough
to
destroy
what
we
think
is
very
valuable.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
--
we're
in
a
dust
bowl
and
anyone
that
depends
upon
the
fish
in
alaska
is
in
tough
shape
and
that
includes
these
people.
but
it's
so
easy
to
--
to
shift
their
means
of
catching
fish
from
a
fish
trap
to
boats.
that's
the
way
the
rest
of
the
indians
in
alaska
fished.
that's
the
way
the
kake
and
angoon
fished
until
1948
and
1950,
they've
only
relied
upon
this
device
for
10
or
12
years.
of
course,
it's
going
to
hurt
them.
and
i
can't
help
that
that
hurts
them.if
they'll
be
for,
i
presume,
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government,
if
they
--
if
they
--
want
to
assist,
to
assist
and
up
to
the
state
to
assist.
but
the
--
the
fact
remains
that
you
cannot
take
a
sick
industry
and
all
the
rest
of
the
communities
in
alaska
to
not
take
a
sick
industry
and
suddenly
be
well
again.
no
matter
what
we
do,
with
or
without
the
fish
traps,
this
will
hurt.
it
will
require
a
shift
in
policy
as
every
community
that
has
had
fish
traps
or
every
group
of
people
or
private
citizens
or
canneries
and
a
lot
of
them
have
closed.
it
does
hurt
because
the
resource
is
sick.
mr.
john
l.
rader
metlakatla?
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
that
--
that
gets
us
into
their
whole
status.
it's
a
--
it's
a
state
school.
it's
state
laws.
they
pay
state
taxes.
they
send
representatives
to
the
state
legislature,
things
of
that
nature.
and
i
--
if
you
want
to
call
them
wards
of
the
government,
in
one
sense,
they
are.
the
government
has
extended
a
--
a
hand
to
them,
which
everyone
appreciates,
and
which
i
think
could
be
extended
after
this
litigation
no
matter
what
happens
to
it.
but
--
and
we
do
--
we
do
not
think
that
you
can
--
you
can
destroy
our
sovereignty
in
that
process.
and
we
think
that
for
these
villagers,
what
did
these
villagers
think
when
they
voted
against
fish
traps?
what
did
angoon
think
when
they
voted
127
to
7
against
fish
traps
that
when
fish
traps
are
finally
going
to
abolish,
what
they
would
do.
this
is
what
they
knew
and
what
we
all
believed.
and
that
is
we
depend
upon
the
resource.
the
fish
traps
have
destroyed
the
resource.
we
will
abolish
our
fish
traps
if
everyone
else
will
abolish
theirs.
and
we
will
use
boats.
and
of
course,
it's
going
to
hurt.
but
in
10
or
15
years,
perhaps
we
can
rebuild
this
fishery.
the
way
it
is
now,
it's
a
--
it's
been
a
consistent
lying
down
for
50
years
and
i
don't
doubt
for
a
moment
that
--
in
fact,
believe
me,
i
don't
believe
that
these
--
that
these
people
would
be
fishing
in
these
fish
traps
if
it
were
not
probably
for
their
economic
situation.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
right.
well,
but
then
they
--
they
understand
well
what
the
fish
trap
issue
is
and
has
been
and
their
position
in
leading
and
fighting
for
the
abolition
of
fish
traps.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
a
fish
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
this
--
it's
a
--
a
fish
trap
is
a--
underwater
throughout,
so
to
speak.
there's
a
lot
of
different
types
of
fish
traps,
but
these
are
floating
fish
traps.
they
float
out
of
three
city
blocks,
900
feet
into
the
water.
they're
anchored
with
5000
pound
anchors
to
hold
them
away
from
shore.
they
have
to
be
put
in
position
by
large
tugs
and
things
like
that.
they
have
a
wire
that
extends
--
the
lead
goes
from
the
trap
to
the
shore.
and
the
lead
is
a
wire
fence
that
extends
from
the
surface
of
the
water
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean.
and
the
migratory
salmon
in
seeking
their
freshwater
streams
to
go
back
to
their
spawning
grounds
go
along
the
coast,
they
hit
this
lead.
they
can't
pass.
they
wary
along
the
lead
until
they
come
out
to
the
end
of
it,
and
at
the
end
of
it
is
a
theory
of
ever
confining
spaces.
the
fish
will
finally
come
and
swim
into
one
space
and
--
by
--
by
fins
and
so
and
so
forth
while
he
finally
ends
up
in
a
pot.
and
then
you
come
along
with
a
brailer.
you
brail
out
your
fish
trap
and
you
take
out
tons
of
fish
and
put
them
on
a
scuttle.
mr.
john
l.
rader
tons
of
fish.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
boat
fisherman
has
a
net
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
with
a
--
with
a
--
well,
this
is
a
--
there's
--
the
net
is
something
like
i
a
pick
up
with
my
both
hands.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
it's
a
--
it's
cloth
net.
mr.
john
l.
rader
they
vary
in
--
in
different
places.
it's
all
set
out
in
the
regulation.
i
think
some
of
them
--
i
think
they
vary
from
--
i
think
around
200
--
250
yards,
something
like
that.
mr.
john
l.
rader
almost
as
long.
they're
not
as
deep
and
the
--
the
efficiency
of
the
net
is
--
is
not
a
fraction
of
what
a
trap
is,
but
they
do
--
they
are
long
in
some
areas
and
then
they
have
set
nets
that
are
a
lot
shorter.
and
they
may
be
50
or
100
yards
long.
the
set
net
is
anchored
to
the
beach
similar
to
a
fish
trap.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
the
only
kind
they
can
do.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
right.
they
had
no
other
--
no
other
way
to
do
it
to
see
this
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
it's
a
mass
fishing,
but
it
doesn't
hold
accountable
to
a
fish
trap
for
efficiency,
ability
to
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
it's
a
--
it's
a
question
of
efficiency
and
quantity.
there
is
the
additional
--
as
i
say,
this
is
disputed
but
--
there
are
many
who
believe
that
a
fish
trap
has
the
ability
to
swallow
a
complete
school
and
thereby,
leave
a
stream
bare.
well
now,
how
active
that
is,
it's
hard
to
say.
that's
debatable.
we
just
don't
know
that
much
about
the
fish,
but
we
do
know
every
so
often
we
end
up
with
a
barren
stream
and
fishermen
have
ways
of
deducing
these
things
at
a
--
i
don't
know
if
they're
accurate
or
not,
but
that's
certainly
what
a
lot
of
them
believe.
mr.
john
l.
rader
there's
a
brailer.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
we
call
it
brailer.
mr.
john
l.
rader
b-r-a-i-l.
brail.
it
has
a
--
it
has
a
false
floor
on
it
that's
made
out
of
a
net
and
the
--
the
scuttle
comes
along
size
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
and
raises
the
whole
thing
and
pulls
it
up
in
the
air
like
this
and
it
dumps
in
--
throws
the
fish
into
the
scuttle.
mr.
john
l.
rader
it's
quite
an
operation.
congress
in
the
--
in
section
4,
if
we
want
to
construe
the
intent,
particularly
as
--
the
--
the
legislative
history
on
section
4
has
preserved
the
status
quo
to
neither
enlarge
nor
decrease
indian
fishing
rights.
the
congressional
history
as
to
the
commercial
fishery
of
alaska,
if
you
go
back
before
hynes
versus
grimes,
go
back
about
1916,
columbia
river
versus
berg,
it
was
held
then
that
there
was
no
exclusive
right
to
anyone
in
a
--
into
an
exclusive
fishery
of
alaska.
you
have
the
hynes
--
you
have
the
white
act
of
1924,
where
congress
specifically
prohibited
any
exclusive
fishing
right.
this
court
in
dow
versus
ickes,
when
fish
traps
were
destroyed
by
a
regulation
of
the
secretary
of
interior
in
1934
or
thereabouts,
this
court
held
that
no
one
had
a
right
to
a
fish
trap.
in
hynes
versus
grimes,
when
the
secretary
of
interior
attempted
to
give
the
karluk
indians
a
reservation,
it
was
held
that
he
could
not
do
so,
a
single
amount,
give
them
special
treatment.
section
6
(c)
of
the
statehood
act
talks
about
turning
over
to
alaska
its
commercial
fisheries
on
a
certain
timetable
which
has
now
occurred
and
actually,
as
a
matter
of
act,
this
litigation
occurred
when
section
6
(c)
was
in
effect.
section
6
(c)
said
that
the
secretary
of
interior
shall
have
the
right
to
continue
to
manage
alaska's
fisheries
until
such
time
as
he
certifies
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
they
have
made
adequate
provisions
to
protect
and
manage
the
resource
he
has
certified.
in
other
words,
the
statehood
act
itself
indicated,
there
would
be
a
turnover
to
the
state
of
its
fisheries.
section
6
(c)
also
calls
for
the
transfer
of
all
the
property
of
the
federal
government
used
in
the
policing
of
these
fisheries
and
that's
boats
all
the
way
from
15
feet
to
100
feet
long
to
turn
them
over
to
the
state
to
police
the
industry,
to
police
the
fishery.
we
argue
that
because
it
was
--
it
--
it
shows
the
complete
withdrawal
of
the
federal
government
from
the
regulation
and
control
of
the
fishery,
and
the
complete
transfer
by
every
means
apparent
to
alaska
of
the
means
and
the
methods,
the
property
to
control
that
fishery.
and
here
we
have
indians
who
are
42%
of
our
commercial
fishermen
who
are
no
longer
under
our
control
under
the
theory
of
kake
and
angoon.
under
the
theory
of
metlakatla,
if
they
confine
themselves
to
the
reservation,
it's
a
different
problem.
but
on
the
theory
of
kake
and
angoon,
it
cannot
be
stopped
there.
then
are
two
--
then
on
59
corporations.
mr.
john
l.
rader
if
there
was
a
property
right,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
that's
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
there
could
be
a
particular
place,
but
when
--
but
--
but
there
was
no
disclaimer
of
jurisdiction
as
to
the
control
of
its
fisheries
of
sovereignty.
mr.
john
l.
rader
it
certain
--
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
--
i
would
think
that
it
would
be.
i
--
i
only
bring
it
up
to
as
--
as
persuasive
as
to
the
intent
of
congress
to
turn
over
to
us
what
--
what
appears
to
be
--
control
the
fishery
at
the
same
time,
say
42%
of
the
people
in
the
fishery
though,
aren't
under
your
control.
they
didn't
intend
any
such
thing.
when
congress
said
that
they
were
going
to
preserve
the
status
quo
and
not
tinker
with
--
with
native
rights,
i
think
that's
what
they
meant
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
picture
before
statehood
and
after
statehood
to
see
what
they
have
today
and
they
never
had
a
right
to
fish
with
a
fish
trap
by
nature
of
a
property
interest
or
an
aboriginal
right,
because
it's
a
different
type
of
device.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
think
that
those
rights
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
no,
our
construction
doesn't
do
that.
our
construction
says
if
they
fish
on
the
same
basis
of
every
other
citizen
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
which
is
the
way
they
fished
since
anybody
up
there
knows
any
differently.
they've
always
fished
that
way
and
we
--
congress
says
status
quo,
we
think
that's
what
they
meant.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
returning
to
the
--
to
that
problem,
i
have
said
status
quo
because
the
language
that
the
parenthetical
phrase
is
not
very
explanatory,
but
the
committee
reports
on
page
30
of
our
brief,
the
committee
report
to
the
88th
congress
states
that,
“it
has
provided
that
no
attempt
will
be
made
to
deal
with
the
legal
merits
of
the
indigenous
rights,
but
to
leave
the
matter
in
status
quo
for
either
a
future
legislative
action
or
judicial
determination.
i'm
trying
to
make
some
sense
out
of
what
congress
meant
by
fishing
rights.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
can
it
say
--
yes,
but
can
you
say
then
that
--
that
they
are
completely
unrestricted
as
to
anything
that
--
if
this
was
a
compact
--
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
think
it
came
in,
in
1952.
it's
been
in
there
quite
a
while.
i
mean
in
--
in
these
predecessors
of
the
statehood
act.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
of
--
of
the
bill
that
was
finally
passed.
in
fact,
it's
been
--
it's
appeared
in
every
statehood
act
since
1952,
in
front
of
everything
--
every
congress,
there
has
been
a
statehood
act
proposed.
mr.
john
l.
rader
and
i
believe
that
this
parenthetical
expression
has
appeared
in
all
of
them.
appellant
metlakatla
withdraws
that
out
very
nicely
in
the
legislative
history,
and
that's
my
recollection
if
they're
correct
on
it.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
it
--
it
wasn't
in
existence.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
don't
know.
they
didn't
have
any
rules
and
they
didn't
consider
themselves
in
existence
from
the
point
of
view
of
--
of
dates
or
--
or
work
or
anything
else.
i
mean,
the
--
maybe
they
were
in
existence,
maybe
they
weren't,
but
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
--
i
think
it's
october
the
5th.
mr.
john
l.
rader
perhaps
they
were
dated
--
and
i
think
the
effective
date
though
was
october
the
5th.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
they
--
they
were
taking
--
they
took
appeals
from
the
interim
federal
courts.
mr.
john
l.
rader
from
that
date
on.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
and
they
made
it
retroactive
too.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
rights
of
appeal.
mr.
john
l.
rader
not
without
jeopardizing
--
very
seriously,
not
without
taking
a
chance
that
--
that
they
would
hear
the
appeal.
i
would
have
had
no
assurance.
in
other
words,
their
time
ran
out
before
the
supreme
court
rules
were
effective
and
i
presume
that
the
supreme
court
rules
would
be
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
our
state
statute
said
that
the
state
supreme
court
may
hear
appeals
from
the
interim
courts.
it
was
contemplated
that
at
the
time
that
statute
was
written
by
the
state
that
perhaps
reducing
interim
courts
for
up
to
three
years.
the
parker
versus
mccarrey
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
when
it
declined
jurisdiction,
threw
us
in
a
position
of
having
to
organize
a
state
court
as
rapidly
as
possible,
and
it
was
a
question,
vantage,
around
--
quite
a
lot
around
alaska
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
the
state
supreme
court
would
back
up
and
take
appeals
which
had
been
--
of
cases
which
have
been
processed
since
statehood
by
the
federal
courts
and
which
the
ninth
circuit
wouldn't
hear.
and
i
didn't
know
for
certain
whether
they
would
or
would
not,
and
i
do
not
think
that
these
appellants
could
have
known
for
certain
whether
they
would
or
would
not.
therefore,
they
had
the
appeal
here,
the
record
had
been
sent
here,
the
court
up
there
was
not
property,
that
they'd
handed
someone
a
piece
of
paper
that
wouldn't
have
anything
that
happened.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
state
supreme
court
has
withheld,
passing
on
jurisdiction,
pending
a
determination
by
this
court
as
to
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
l.
rader
under
its
rules
--
this
is
a
type
of
case
that
could
be
--
could
have
been
appealed.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
--
they
probably
would
know
more
about
the
state
intent,
but
we're
not
urging
at
all
that
this
be
sent
back
there
because
we
consider
this
to
be
a
critical
problem
and
the
fishing
season
is
upon
us
and
the
--
the
questions
are
going
to
have
to
be
decided
and
the
quicker
they're
decided,
the
better
off
that
these
appellants
will
be
in
the
state.
mr.
john
l.
rader
july
the
2nd,
i
believe.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
think
some
back
it
appeared
to
be
october
the
2nd.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
it
--
it
certainly
wasn't
doing
any
business
in
the
effect,
the
date
of
the
rules.
mr.
john
l.
rader
implied
just
as
soon
as
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
during
september?
during
august,
i
believe,
two
judges
were
appointed
and
one
federal
judge
was
appointed.
he
went
on
30
days.
i
think
he
was
appointed
around
the
1st
of
september.
that
was
a
relic
in
the
90-day
period
though.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that
would
have
been
probably
the
chief
justice
of
our
state
supreme
court.
mr.
john
l.
rader
excuse
me
just
a
second.
i
beg
your
honors'
pardon.
my
associate
directs
my
attention,
takes
three
judges
under
our
state
law
to
have
a
supreme
court
and
that
the
last
one
was
appointed
on
september
the
2nd.
mr.
john
l.
rader
was
appointed
september
2nd.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
they
did.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
maybe
it
was
at
being,
but
could
these
appellants
appeal
to
it.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
the
rules
weren't
effective
within
the
period
of
time
that
they
had
to
take
their
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
think
the
rules
themselves
make
their
effective
date
october
the
5th
and
they
were
promulgated,
i
think,
on
the
26th
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
--
as
a
matter
of
publishing.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
could
be
in
error
on
that.
mr.
john
l.
rader
october
1st
or
2nd.
september
30th.
counsel
tells
me
september
30th.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
in
other
words,
they
were
published
for
10
days
before
they
became
effective.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes,
that
was
filed
though
i
think
december
by
these
appellants.
mr.
john
l.
rader
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
does
not
note
a
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
l.
rader
it
hasn't
expressed
anything
(inaudible)
other
than
they
would
wait
for
the
outcome
of
this
court.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
think
that
the
appellants
there
have
filed
a
notice
of
appeal.
well
i
--
i
guess
you're
right.
they
haven't
been
asked
to
it.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i'd
have
to
ask
the
appellants
themselves
as
to
what
action
they
did
request
to
the
state
supreme
court.
as
i
recall,
they
filed
only
the
notice
of
appeal
and
--
and
made
a
motion
to
have
everything
held
up
pending,
a
determination
by
this
court
or
the
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
believe
that
they
had
60
days
from
october
the
5th.
mr.
john
l.
rader
from
october
the
5th.
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that's
right.
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
the
fact
of
a
judgment
is
that
if
we
do
go
back,
it's
just
a
matter
of
days,
i
presume,
until
we're
back
here.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
certainly,
that
would
be
helpful.
we
noted
that
in
our
argument
that
this
case
should
be
declared
moot
because
it
was
done
under
6
(e)
that
if
further
judicial
refining
and
processing
along
the
line
would
probably
be
distinctly
helpful
but
it
--
we
don't
construe
it
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
state
or
the
people
of
the
state
nor
an
interest
of
these
appellants
to
have
this
thing
delayed
any
longer
because
of
the
imminence
of
the
--
the
problem
is
becoming
pretty
critical.
mr.
john
l.
rader
it
will
start
within
about
three
weeks.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
i
think
that
the
one
you
have
entered
probably
still
restrains
us
through
this
season
because
it
wasn't
limited
just
to
1959.
it
was
little
bit
broader
from
that.
mr.
john
l.
rader
we
wouldn't
be
affected
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
there's
emergency
as
to
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
use
these
fish
traps
this
year.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
that
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
that
--
that's
staying
perhaps
will
go
on
forever.
we
--
but
--
but
on
the
merits
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
yes.
but
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
in
fact,
the
purposes
would
be,
well,
not
in
june
but
if
you
wait
until
--
actually,
the
season
will
be
over
pretty
well
on
august.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
--
i
believe
that
they
are.
i
think
that
they
like
everyone
else
we're
trying
to
withhold
them
as
much
as
they
can
until
they
find
out
what
happens
here
but
i
think
that
they
had
been
forced
already
to
make
preliminary
expenditures,
preliminary
purchases
because
if
the
opinion
is
in
their
favor
without
using
if
is
not
to
minimize
their
loss.
i
think
they're
trying
to
withhold
but
i'm
certain
that
they
have
incurred
some
expenditures.
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
think
that
there
will
be
a
construction
of
the
compact
between
the
state
and
united
states
which
is
section
4
no
matter
who
losses
this
case
in
front
of
the
state
--
state
supreme
court.
the
other
party
is
going
to
be
here
probably
unless
--
well,
of
course
if
the
state
lost,
why
we
wouldn't
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
no.
i
--
i
--
it
was
too
broad,
i'm
sorry.
[laughs]
i
apologize.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
the
question
--
the
question
was
--
mr.
john
l.
rader
i
don't
--
i
--
i've
just
--
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
--
that
it's
going
to
--
it'll
--
it'll
rest
on
this
court
finally
one
way
or
another.
i
feel
certain
of
that.
and
i
--
and
i
think
that
because
i
feel
that
way,
i
--
i
urge
upon
the
court
to
--
to
take
it
now
and
decide
the
question
so
long
the
facts
indicate
this.
mr.
john
l.
rader
well,
it's
partly.
partly,
it
was
certainly
no
longer
to
our
interest.
if
this
--
if
this
court
had
ruled
against
jurisdiction
or
had
ruled
that
the
case
was
moot
six
months
ago,
then
there
could
be
a
new
lawsuit
brought
on
the
new
regulations
and
we
probably
could
have
been
here
before
the
fishing
season
and
it
would
still
been
a
lot
better.
but
when
we
get
into
the
situation
we're
in
right
now
why
it
--
it's
very
damaging
to
have
this
go
on
any
longer
and
we'd
like
to
have
it
decided.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
l.
rader
that
is
our
position.
