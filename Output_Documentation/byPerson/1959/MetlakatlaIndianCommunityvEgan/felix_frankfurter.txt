what's
the
aid
of
the

justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
what
is
forbidden
by
the
state,
by
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
the
secretary's
authorization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
directed
against
the
--
the
--
the
prohibition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
this
--
when
did
this
regulation
begin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
exactly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
the
territory
of
the
last
--
whether
the
1959
legislation
was
the
first
intervention
by
alaska
whether
as
including
--
it's
stated
to
the
territory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
field
in
which
he
didn't
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
no.
my
question
doesn't
concern
the
issue
is.i
want
to
know
the
historic
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
first
time
that
this
prohibitory
step
was
taken
by
alaska.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
the
state,
it
couldn't
have
--
if
it
wasn't
the
state
who
couldn't
have
acted
in
the
state
before,
but
as
a
territory,
it
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
any
local,
territorial
--
didn't
take
any
local
territorial
step.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
is
a
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
of
course,
it
may
have
right
to
the
state
but
it
didn't
have
as
a
territory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
say
that,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
mean
as
to
this,
but
as
to
something,
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
the
word
of
the
statute
make
it
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
are
the
words?
what
is
the
wording?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you're
right
that
you
could've
gone
to
the
supreme
court
of
--
you
couldn't
now,
could
you've
then,
at
no
time
can
you
go
on
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
--
at
what
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
if
there
was
a
supreme
court
within
the
appealable
period
of
taking
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
alaska,
why
wouldn't
that
enable
you
to
go
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
it
was
created
afterwards.
but
if
it
wasn't
and
--
if
it
wasn't
existent
within
a
period
--
within
which
by
the
statutes
of
--
of
alaska
or
the
ruler
of
the
supreme
court,
there
would've
been
ample
time
to
go
from
a
district
court
to
--
to
the
then
newly
created
supreme
court,
what
would
have
barred
you
on
this
--
barred
attempt
--
alaska
law
to
go
there,
although
that
wasn't
(inaudible)
at
the
time
the
decision
was
rendered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
put
the
case
the
other
way
around,
if
you
had
neither
going
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
maybe
this
court
having
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
if
--
if
there
was
a
time
before
this
court
came
to
act
on
its
appeal
to
go
to
a
--
a
still
higher
court
than
that
which
rendered
the
decision,
then
for
me,
at
least,
the
question
is
raised
whether
they
wanted
an
existence,
the
highest
court
other
than
the
lower
court,
which
rendered
the
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
get
it.
i'm
asking
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
time
did
you
have
to
come
here?
is
this
a
three-month
or
90-day
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nom
but
under
the
statute
--
under
the
statute,
how
much
time,
did
you
have
90
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now,
if
no
appeal
had
been
taken
within
--
from
the
district
court
to
this
court
and
in
the
meantime,
the
supreme
court
had
been
established
for
alaska,
so
that
--
and
thereafter
you
filed
an
appeal
here.
that
would
raise
in
a
security
for
me
against
the
question
whether
at
that
time,
the
highest
court
or
the
district
court
or
the
newly
created
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
question
therefore,
if
--
if
you
say
yes
to
that,
then
i
think
you
will
have
a
little
difficulty
with
me,
at
least,
to
say
that
because
you
came
here
before,
but
in
the
meantime,
a
highest
court
has
created,
it
didn't
--
it
wasn't
the
highest
court
when
we
come
to
consider
the
question.

the

does

a

something
like

mr.

may
i
cover
you,
before

adverted

justice

mr.

as
in

says

is

that's

of

would
you
mind
reading
those

yes,
yes.
justice

that
means
we
have
to
decide
this
case.
justice
felix

i
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
said
we
don't
have
to
face
this
question.
we
have
to
face
the
question
whether
including
fishing
rights,
that
fishing
rights
and
for
instance,
gains
its
meaning
or
is
colored
by
the
proceeding
word,
any
lands
or
other
property.
and
those
are
terms
that
--
that
may
well
be
argued.
i
doubt
this
is
argued,
mean
contensible
interests.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
we
have
to
face
that?
i
just
want
to
know
whether
we
don't
have
face
that
question,
and
if
so,
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
we
must
find
that.
we
may
agree
with
your
conclusion
that
is
what
it
means.
but
i
don't
quite
understand
why
i
don't
have
to
face
determination
of
what
it
does
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that's
it
--
the
question
that
the
--
that
the
united
states
has
any
--
any
property
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
standing
here
to
say
and
say
that
the
right
of
alaska
as
a
state
concern
with
state
power
is
limited
by
the
reservation
of
section
4,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
don't
i
have
to
construe
what
it
is
that
will
reserve?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
right
--
i
don't
see
how
i'm
relieved
of
the
responsibility
of
--
in
which
you
want
to
relieve
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
--
what
the
reservation
is
about,
what
it
is
that
it's
reserved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i've
--
i'd
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
got
not
problem
of
eminent
domain
here.
he's
got
a
problem
of
state
power,
clearly
has
been
limited
by
the
limit
--
by
the
regular
basis
in
the
act
of
admission.
but
to
answer
that,
one
has
to
decide
what
(inaudible)
to
deserve.
or
secondly,
what
could
be
what
he
deserves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
there
another
argument
namely
that
granting
power
of
the
federal
government,
granting
the
reservation
as
what
you
say
it
is,
does
that
deny
or
withdraw
the
reserve
power
to
the
state,
loosely
called
the
police
power,
i
mean
this
--
the
principal
underscore
of
the
police
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
--
to
put
a
concrete
case,
i
take
that
you
would
say
that
alaska
couldn't
possibly,
couldn't
legally
or
would
not
have
power
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
no
children
below
the
age
of
eight
--
put
it
--
put
it
offensively,
no
children
below
the
old
age
of
eight
should
be
engaged
in
any
commercial
occupation
relating
to
the
fishing.
you
say
not?
that's
what
i
mean
by
a
police
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
negative
kind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that's
what
they
say
here
that
you
shouldn't
--
a
fishing
right,
what
is
destructive
of
a
defect,
wouldn't
or
a
--
pervasive
state
interest,
if
not
one
of
those
rights
of
reserve.
and
that
language
in
terms,
absolute,
isn't
--
haven't
got
that
absolute
(inaudible)
what
about
my
child
labor
case,
you
have
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
they
couldn't.
you
say
the
state
of
alaska
could?
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
and
then
by
pride,
they
must
say,
i
think
they're
many
offenses
to
this
court
which
said
that
state
police
power
could
not
possibly
reform
from
the
state,
something
that
really
goes
to
the
--
to
the
deepest
life
interest
of
the
state.
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you'd
say
that
would
be
all
left
to
the
direction
and
control
and
protection
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
--
i
know
those
words,
but
is
that
what
they
mean?
i
know
a
word
plenary.
does
it
really
mean
that
a
state
is
dislodged
from
passing
something
that's
fundamental
to
the
life
of
people
within
itself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
might
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
it.
that's
all
you
have
to
do
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
would
all
those
sites
be
covered
by
the
reservation
of
section
4
as
construed
by
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
are
all
these
--
are
all
these
--
would
they
all
come
in
under
the
three
categories
of
natives
who's
fishing
rights
are
protected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
--
they're
eskimos,
indians,
and
aleuts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
said
there
were
260.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
know
is
whether
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
this,
how
many
such
communities
are
there
in
the
whole
of
alaska
as
to
which
fishing
rights
are
reserved
as
they're
claimed
to
be
reserved
by
the
government
in
regard
including
these
two
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
if
you
tested
the
question,
would
be
extended
as
to
what
the
ratio
of
the
output
of
a
possible
59,
the
total
would
be
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
considerable,
that
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
does
that
apply
to
these
two
communities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
the
government
as
i
understood
him
to
say,
angoon
in
behalf
of
the
united
states,
he
asserted
the
right
to
make
similar
regulations
as
to
other
sites
unless
you've
been
seen
by
the
secretary
of
interior
that
traps
would
be
deleterious
to
--
to
or
that
the
traps
should
be
allowed.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
this
is
a
general
problem
of
potential
power
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
calhoun,
although
said,
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
regulation
in
the
technical
standard.
that
the
government
--
the
federal
or
the
indian
in
control
of
the
federal
government
and
reserve
right
to
--
by
the
federal
government
according
to
his
argument,
applied
to
indians.
they
don't
have
to
be
organizing
a
reservation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
a
man
may
have
a
status
of
indian
without
living
on
a
reservation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
in
your
view
was
reserved
by
section
4?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
need
them
after
congress
come
to
this
court,
i
mean,
because
that
was
a
such
a
poor
reserve?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can
litigate
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
especial
--
that
--
that
they
do
talk
about
fishery
rights.
so,
that
must
have
been
addressed
to
some
actuality
in
the
new
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
these
were
idle
words
in
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
always
has
--
how
far
back?
does
it
go
back
to
that,
the
conservationists,
if
there's
any
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
what
i
mean
is,
i
gathered
from
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
the
department
has
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
conservation
and
on
the
merits
of
--
of
canvas
of
that
issue,
concluded
that
the
utilization
of
these
traps
is
not
destructive
over
fishery,
isn't
that
right?
and
if
that
is
so,
i
was
wondering
how
far
back
the
--
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
made
that
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
may
be
a
good
reason
for
a
white
fisherman
to
come
here
and
say
“i'm
being
discriminated
against.”
what
gives
the
state's
standing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
--
whole
point
of
section
4
is
to
qualify
your
egalitarian
system
by
referring
whatever
special
rights
the
indians
may
have
had
because
they
were
indians.
that
doesn't
tell
me
what
those
rights
were,
but
the
whole
significance,
unless,
you
just
wipe
out,
sponge
out
section
4
is
to
give
indians
a
treatment
different
from
everybody
else,
the
indians
and
the
other
two
native
categories.
i
think
it
would
send
a
message.
the
whole
point
of
that
is
not
to
subject
them
to
a
uniform
rule
but
to
leave
them
whatever
protection
maybe
accorded
by
the
united
states
government.
isn't
that
true?
except
that
you
say,
“i
can
understand
the
argument.”
that's
unconstitutional,
but
you
can't
pursue
away
section
4
in
creating
and
establishing
a
special
packet
of
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
whatever
they
define
that.
they
say
the
property
of
other
rights
with
--
including
fishing
right.
and
that's
why
we're
here
to
ascertain
what
fishing
rights
are
--
in
the
first
place,
what
the
category
covers
and
whether
this
comes
within
the
category.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
saw
your
--
your
engaging
argument,
if
i
may
say
so,
is
--
is
on
the
fact
that
--
that
alaska
is
such
a
--
attractive
model
place
where
everybody
run
for
their
equality
with
everybody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
this,
this
makes
a
differentiation.
and
--
and
it
carves
out
--
and
reserves,
carves
out
for
--
for
legal
right
subject
of
the
rule
of
the
--
the
authority
of
united
states
government,
not
suggested
by
others
in
alaska.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
brings
me
to
the
--
that
raises
a
question
as
to
what
is
included.
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
the
--
your
theme
song
of
equality,
of
racial
equality
in
alaska
doesn't
answer
the
problem
of
what
was
reserved
if
it
could
be
reserved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
can't
under
the
guide
that
you're
exercising,
except
the
brief
of
our
argument.
you
can't
say,
“oh,
you're
not
interfering
with
property,
you're
merely
asserting
sovereignty.”
that'd
be
an
easy
way
out
of
nullifying
the
whole
scope
if
it
has
any
scope,
any
constitutional
scope
with
section
4.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
takes
one
to
the
substantive
question
of
whether
these
are
property
rights
in
a
sense
of
the
parenthetical
including
fishery
rights,
but
it
--
it
isn't
met
by
suggesting
that
with
the
operation
quality
as
admirable
as
that
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
isn't
destroyed,
not
on
the
theory
that
indians
are
the
wards
of
the
united
states
government
and
the
wardship
doesn't
cease
upon
the
territory
becoming
a
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
principle
can't
destroy
the
qualification,
otherwise,
there
isn't
any.
justice
felix
frankfurter
3well,
everybody
could
fish,
but
everybody
didn't
have
the
guardianship
of
the
united
states
government,
if
guardianship,
it
was
created
as
--
as
appellant,
you
say
they
were
by
the
various
acts
of
government
and
set
aside
this
tribe,
if
it
did
set
it
aside.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
schools
for
these
indians?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
it?
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
there
was
a
state,
were
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
federal
--
there
were
schools
under
the
authority
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
all
sorts
of
ways,
the
united
states
government
as
the
protector,
never
mind
how
wise
or
unwise,
these
are
the
tests
that's
carried
out.
in
all
sorts
of
ways
providing
schools,
health
provisions,
etcetera,
the
department
of
the
interior,
through
its
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
that's
what
they
were
called,
took
measures
on
their
behalf,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
do
that
whether
you're
white
folk,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
why
would
these
indians
been
treated
differently
because
they
were
indians
and
because
they
were
under
the
or
oversight
or
administrative
regulation
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
weren't
they
in
all
sorts
of
ways?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
--
they
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
money
is
to
white
folks
then
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
in
actual
governmental
deed,
there
was
a
connection,
a
relationship
between
these
indians
and
the
indian
office,
which
showed
that
there
was
a
tie
between
them
as
indians
and
just
the
department
head
oversight
of
indians
for
the
federal
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that
was
a
separate
department
of
--
within
the
department
of
the
interior,
whatever
it
was
called,
possession
and
outlying
dominion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
one
thing,
but
the
indian
office
was
another
thing
and
that
had
responsibility
for
indians.
and
these
people
did
come
under
or
within
the
responsibility
of
the
indian
office
in
all
sorts
of
ways,
lending
them
money,
creating
schools,
special
schools,
probably
a
special
health
service,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
--
they
were
differentiated
then
from
the
rest
of
the
multi
racial
equal
treatment
population
that
was
asked
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
why
people
engage
in
economic
affair.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
they
had
--
pardon
me.
if
they
had
fishing
rights,
those
rights
aren't
the
exercise
of
the
right,
aren't
limited
to
the
means
by
which
they
enforce
the
right
30
years
ago
or
15
years
ago
or
10
years
ago
or
years
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

rights,
that
means
they
had
the
right
to
get
fish,
and
not
to
get
them
in
a
particular
way.
it
might
be
all
sorts
of
improvements
that
are
themselves
in
the
interest
of
conservation.
the
old
construction
would
shut
them
off,
would
say
that
they
could
only
fish
the
way
they
fished
that
their
ancestors
fished.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
congress
didn't
say
status
quo,
you
--
you've
said
that
so
many
times
as
though
that
were
written
in
the
statute.
we
lawyers
always
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
replace
their
phrase
and
then
go
on
and
assume
it's
in
the
original.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
this
--
right
is
a
very
different
thing
than
to
say
they
must
be
restricted
to
how
they
enjoy
them
at
the
time
they
enjoyed
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
cover
--
cover
that
english
word.
imagination
of
people
who
draft
in
compact
is
limited.
that's
why
we
have
lawsuits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
rader,
a
little
problem
by
dates.
when
was
this
case
decided
below
in
the
--
in
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
2nd
of
july,
when
was
the
90
days
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
noticed
that
the
rules
of
the
--
of
your
supreme
court
were
promulgated
on
the
25th
of
september,
also
that
rule
be
promulgated
by
a
court
that
wasn't
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
court
was
in
existence,
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
was
in
existence
for
some
time,
and
didn't
have
any
business
and
the
court
adjourned
again
and
again
and
again
because
there's
no
business
because
the
court
--
but
the
court
was
in
existence
starting
september
24,
1789.
when
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
president
washington
amended.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
(inaudible)
juneau,
alaska
this
25th
day
of
september,
special
application
of
rule,
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
alaska.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
must
have
been
any
--
there
must
have
been
a
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
they
must
have
gotten
together
somewhere
and
formulated
these
rules
and
the
date
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
think
one
could
look,
go
to
the
inference,
it's
in
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
was
in
being,
couldn't
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
have
the
rules
which
told
them
how
to
appeal
and
what
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
effect
on
those.
there
was
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
--
when
was
the
time
up
to
the
year
and
with
the
90
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
--
there
must
have
been
somebody
--
somebody
to
news
mails
and
--
and
could
have
dropped
the
notice
of
appeal,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
is
the
fishing
season.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
dispose
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what's
the
status
again?
no
matter
who
losses,
somebody
will
be
here
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
what
--
what
--
do
you
have
(inaudible)
mr.
rader?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
is
that
--
why
is
any
action
that
this
court
may
take
as
suggested
in
the
other
end
of
the
bench
with
the
view
of
getting
perhaps
more
light
on
some
of
the
local
situation,
that
i
mean
on
the
economic.
what
i
mean
--
why
would
--
why
would
such
action
necessitate
the
disposition
that's
--
without
raising
res
judicata.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
no
one
--
no
one
suggested
you
want
to
allege
as
to
bring
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
supreme
court
is
right
here,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
theory
that
--
the
theory
of
legislation
is
prohibition,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
there
is
a
sharp
issue
of
conservation
policy,
namely
whether
the
evil
is
--
whether
there
is
such
an
inherent
evil
with
the
state
assuming
it
has
started
to
step
in
and
bother
it
and
prohibit
the
further
practice
or
on
the
secretary's
point
of
view
that
regulation
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
certainly,
the
most
incompetent
person
in
the
world
have
a
view
on
the
merits
of
that.
at
least
i
can't
imagine
anybody
less
competent
--
less
incompetent
than
i
am.
but
the
issue
seems
to
be
one
of
conservation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
different
views
of
what
conservation
calls
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it's
easier
to
take
more
by
one
method
than
another
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
might
be
a
factor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
that
the
--
the
position
of
your
--
your
possession
--
the
department's
position
is
that
there
is
in
section
4
no
quantitative
limits,
upon
whatever
rights
they
reserve.
is
that
right?
