it
depends
on
how
you
define
indian,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
under
some
of
our
reservation,
the
--
a
person
as
indian
if
he
had
one-sixty
fourth
of
indian
blood
in
him.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
didn't
give
us
the
court
of
claims
citation
for
federal
supplement.
justice
william
o.
douglas
thank
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
can
be
--
can
very
destructive
too
some
species,
can
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
as
i
--
as
i
read
the
section
4
that
refers
to
rights
acquired
and
the
rights
of
pardon.
here,
it
must
come
to
the
court
that
acquired
under
the
white
act,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
nobody,
so
far,
has
in
my
satisfaction,
yet
answered
the
argument
of
the
district
judge
that
the
white
act
forbids
this.
the
rights
that
--
that
are
to
establish
traps
come
--
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
grants,
derived
from
some
power
on
his
part
and
presumably,
the
white
act.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
didn't
agree
with
our
court's
construction
as
the
white
act
in
the
hynes
case,
but
the
majority
held
that
it
couldn't
be
given
to
a
one
tribe
or
a
select
group.
that
it
had
to
apply
generally,
geographically,
the
area
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
and
this
1959
doesn't
do
that,
the
1959
regulation,
does
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
--
that's
--
maybe
that's
the
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
there's
a
part
of
the
discussion
in
the
justice
reed's
opinion
that
--
that
this
must
be,
perhaps
there
could
be
allowed,
whites
and
indians,
everyone
else
in
that
area
must
be
allowed
to
have
traps.
as
it's
the
regulation
of
the
area.
my
difficulty,
i
don't
want
to
delay
you,
but
my
difficulty
is
seeing
how
that
white
act
becomes
transformed
to
a
regulatory
scheme
just
for
indians,
by
reason
of
section
4
of
this
amending
act.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
proviso
there
does
read
that
every
such
regulation
made
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
shall
be
a
general
application
within
the
particular
area
that
which
it
applies,
can't
be
anymore,
under
you
argument,
a
general
application
in
the
particular
area
because
it
applies
in
a
particular
area,
only
the
indian.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
could
understand
that,
that's
where
the
white
act
is
written,
but
i
have
difficulty
in
so
reading
the
white
act.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
indians
weren't
the
ones
that
destroyed
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
whatever
we
decide
here,
won't
affect
that
or
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
only
regulation
involved
here
is
a
(inaudible)
the
1959
one
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
on
page
--
page
76
of
your
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
the
secretary
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
that
the
secretary
hasn't
suggested
has
he
that
he
would
authorize
the
use
of
fish
traps
of
any
locations
except
these
three?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
21
or
are
they
identified
with
these
three
communities?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
beyond
those
21?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
do
you
think
he
--
would
he
have
encourage
to?
justice
william
o.
douglas
up
to
1959.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i've
been
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i've
been
reading
some
things
on
fish
traps
including
governor
--
senator
(inaudible)
fine
book
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
of
state
of
alaska.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
issue
sometimes
gets
down
to
the
question
as
to
how
well
they're
managed
or
how
well
they're
supervised
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
but
this
is
theoretical
conversation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
comes
down
to
police
power
then.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
fishing
rights
that
they
--
they'd
be
considered
a
property
interest
where
--
as
all
people
in
alaska
were
always
subject
to
whether
indians
are
not
to
general
regulations.
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
by
that,
by
the
federal
government.
