justice

black
may
i
ask
you
on
that
subject
just
to
what
extent
the
territory
had
governed
this
indian
group
--
tribe,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise,
their
laws,
civil,
and
criminal
applies
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
in
effect,
are
you
not,
maybe
right,
that
the
government
could
not
if
it
wished,
require
them
to
exercise
once
more
the
powers
of
autonomous
government
such
as
worcester
against
georgia.
you're
arguing
that
that
could
not
be
constitutionally
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they've
always
been
--
always
felt
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
been
--
i
have
--
haven't
quite
understood
the
--
the
part
of
your
statement.
i
don't
know
how
relevant
this
is.
i
thought
you
and
--
said
this
morning
in
answer
to
a
question
that
you
did
not
think
that
the
fishing
of
the
fish,
in
the
way
that
you
have
said
it,
has
occurred,
but
you
do
the
usual
fish
traps
by
the
indian.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
original
act
that
created
that
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
relying
on
the
pollard
case
doctrine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
--
do
you
rely
on
the
pollard
doctrine
in
connection
with
the
last
part
of
the
1891
reservation
statue
which
said,
“subject
to
such
restrictions
may
be
proscribed
from
time
to
time
by
the
secretary
of
interior?”
is
that
the
way
you
--
the
basis
on
which
you
say
that
has
no
bearing
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
in
effect
there
that
if
a
stream
starts
outside
of
a
regular
indian
reservation,
flows
through
it,
then
flows
out
of
it
and
continues
to
flow.
that
the
state
that
control
how
the
water
is
used
in
that
reservation,
contrary
to
the
government's
idea
of
how
it
should
be
regulated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
inland
waters,
it's
not
a
stream.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
precisely,
what
is
the
difference
to
which
you
refer
the
boat
fishing
and
trap
fishing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
one
a
kind
of
a
mass
catching
and
one
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
be
tons
of
fish.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
the
boat
fisherman
goes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
fishes
with
a
net
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
small
net
--
small
net.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
main
kind
of
fishing
that
the
other
indians
do
who
do
not
own
the
fish
traps?
was
that
the
kind
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
kind
of
a
mass
fishing
too
or
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
question
of
quantity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
effect
of
your
primary
judgment
formula.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
think
of
any
determination
that
the
state
supreme
court
could
make
that
would
prevent
--
that
justifies
and
say
it's
been
disposed
of
wholly
on
state
ground,
and
we
therefore
don't
have
to
decide
anything
else
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
way
it
could
be
decided,
i
asked
because
i
think
it's
what
justice
frankfurter
onto
say.
any
way
it
can
be
decided
so
that
you
can
foresee
that
we
wouldn't
have
to
decide
this
federal
question.
