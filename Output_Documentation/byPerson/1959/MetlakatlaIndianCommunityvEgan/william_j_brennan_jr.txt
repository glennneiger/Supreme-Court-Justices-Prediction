this
is

not
perfectly
for
not
regulations
limited
to
authorizations
to
the
metlakatlans

were
they?
they
were

justice

well
but
--
were
--
were
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
promulgated
before
1959
applicable
only
to
these
appellants?
were
they
not
general
regulations?
justice
william
j.

mentioned
these
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
here,
we're
involved
with
only
11
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fish
traps.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
before
that,
it
used
to
be
a
couple
hundred,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
was
--
as
to
these
particular
locations,
were
the
number
before
1959
more
than
11,
total?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
do
you
now
concede
that
it
does
have
jurisdiction
in
--
justice
william
j.

no.
justice

(voice

that
the

of

by
reason
of
the

--
(voice

taken
there
does
have
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
i
fixed
the
time
in
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
--
this
was
a
matter
of
the
supreme
court
rule
rather
than
a
statute,
this
delayed
appeal
this
--
this
permission
to
extend
the
time
in
which
to
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
he
--
may
he
exercise
discretion
not
to
authorize
the
use
of
any
fish
traps?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

correctly
then
that
if
--
your
view
is
that
if
this
maybe
authorized
for
kake
and
angoon,
it
may
also
be
authorized
for
the
trap
sites
related
to
or
connected
with

57
other

things
i
gather
were
built
by
the
federal
government
where
they
--
for
these
communities?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
but
was
the
financing
by
the
federal
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
those
are
the

they
incurred
indebtedness
which
is
substantial,
is
it,
that

justice
william

brennan,

now,
and
metlakatla
was
something
built
by
the
government
or
was
that
also
a
purchase?
justice
william

brennan,

were
they
using
fish
traps
that
far
back?
justice

even
with

hook

a

justice
william

how
do
you
spell
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
rader,
didn't
that
parenthetical
expression
come
into
section
4
rather
late
including
fishing
rights.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
not
on
the
original
proposal
for
section
4,
was
it?
justice

brennan,

and
--
and
this
parenthetical
expression
lean
on

justice
william

well
now,
why
are
they
dated
september
25th
was

as
setting
up
some

justice
william

brennan,

--
some
other
promulgation
of
the
court
which
made
them
effective
later
than
that
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
these
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
see
these
as
rule
53.
these
rules
would
take
effect
on
october
5
even
though
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
will
comment
on
that
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
actually
mr.
rader,
as
i
recall
it
last
year,
it
takes
sometime
to
locate
these
fish
traps
and
if
the
season
open
within
three
weeks,
i
take
it,
they're
in
process
of
being
located
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
couldn't
--
we
couldn't
determine
whether
the
alaska
supreme
court
would
have
moved
here
this
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cragun,
do
you
know
whether
similar
regulations
before
1959
when
--
as
i
understand
it,
it's
250
sites
were
authorized,
were
specified
with
a
particularity
that
these
are
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
at
indian
sites?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
me
this,
mr.
cragun.
i
noticed
at
page
69
that
your
--
well,
it's
that
same
regulation,
it's
page
35
of
your
brief.
not
more
than
21
salmon
fish
trap
sites
heretofore
recognized
as
indian
salmon
fish
trap
location
as
here
and
after
described
maybe
utilized
for
the
purpose
of
salmon
trap
fishing
by
indian
villagers
etcetera.
does
that
--
does
that
suggest
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
determined
that
this
is
the
outside
limit
under
any
circumstances
of
the
number
of
sites
at
which
fish
traps
maybe
authorized?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
suggested
earlier
that
section
4
of
the
statehood
act
is
susceptible
of
a
construction
that
--
that
at
all
250,
indeed,
that's
--
see
the
numbers
334
sites
where
before
statehood,
fish
trap
--
use
of
fish
trap
was
authorized.
might
we
authorize
them
to
section
4.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
--
perhaps
rather
i
should
not
have
troubled
you
with
that
question.
perhaps
i
should
put
it
to
mr.
calhoun
later
as
see
just
precisely
what
is
the
secretary's
view
to
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
rest
might
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
he
gets
up,
i'll
ask
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
really
two
questions.
the
first
mr.
calhoun,
i
sent
out
with
--
to
mr.
cragun.
are
we
to
understand
that
this
88.2
is
a
determination
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
the
outside
limit
of
sites
that
he
may
authorize
is
21?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
is
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice?
does
the
department
believe
that
under
section
4
of
the
statehood
act,
he
has
power
that
as
the
secretary
does
to
authorize
more
sites
than
21?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
allowed
more
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
mean
then
to
the
limit
of
334
which
apparently
was
the
number
of
sites
before
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
