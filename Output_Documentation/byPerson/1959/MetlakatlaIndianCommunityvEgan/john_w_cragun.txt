mr.
john
w.
cragun
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
organized
village
of
kake
in
the
angoon
community
association.
each
of
them
played
to
them
as
so
that
they
were
of
the
tlingit
tribe.
the
allegations
of
the
complaints
are
rather
spared
on
many
of
the
issues
which
have
become
acute
in
this
course
--
court
as
a
result
of
the
state's
brief,
governor
egan's
brief.
i
have
however,
because
of
assertions
in
that
brief,
that
these
are
mere
local
state
villages
or
first
class
cities
did
obtain
from
the
department
of
interior,
as
many
copies
as
i
could
get
of
the
constitution
and
bylaws
in
the
corporate
charter
of
kake
(inaudible)
and
of
angoon
community
association.
i've
handed
to
the
clerk
for
distribution
to
the
judges,
a
copy
of
the
constitution
and
bylaws
and
corporate
charter
of
kake,
which
bears
out
what
was
said
in
their
respective
complaints
that
they
are
organized
under
federal
law.
i
--
i
was
able
to
get
only
one
set
of
the
constitution
and
bylaws
and
corporate
charter
of
angoon
that
has
been
lodged
with
the
clerk.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
kake
alleged
that
it
was
composed
of
400
individuals.
angoon
alleged
that
it
was
composed
of
306.
the
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no,
these
are
natives.
these
are
natives
whose
on
--
who
are
on
their
home
ground
where
they
were
before
the
white
men
first
showed
up
in
alaska,
so
far
as
the
best
of
information
gives
us.
there
has
been
an
instructive
opinion
delivered
by
the
court
of
claims
since
this
case
lodged
in
this
court.
it's
rather
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
state.
it's
not
yet
been
printed
in
the
reports
of
the
court
of
claims,
therefore,
the
--
the
federal
supplement
grant
does
not
contain
the
extensive
findings
of
fact
which
the
court
appended
to
its
opinion,
but
even
the
print
in
the
--
in
federal
supplement,
gives
a
great
deal
of
information
and
background
of
this
on
a
map
on
which
you
can
locate
these
two
villages
as
they
exist
today
and
have
existed
since
the
time
the
white
man
first
came
to
alaska.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
have
no
reliable
information
on
that,
sir.
the
numbers
of
indians
generally
in
this
country
and
i
believe
it's
true
that
alaska,
did
received
for
a
while
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that's
correct.
and
since
then
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
it
does
depend
upon
how
you
define
indian
as
i'm
using
it
here.
i
would
use
the
word
and
does
this
court
has
used
it
on
occasion
in
the
same
way
the
census
taker
would.
how
is
a
man
regarded
by
the
community
in
which
he
lives
without
regard
to
his
racial
background?
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that's
correct,
sir.
i,
myself,
have
known
a
man
who
was
three-quarters
white
man
biologically,
but
he
was
a
full
blood
from
the
standpoint
of
tribal
relations.
he
couldn't
speak
english
until
he
was
pass
21.
his
father
and
his
grandfather
happened
to
be
united
states
army
man.q
it's
perfectly
true.
biologically,
they
are
not
necessarily
pure
indians.
they
can
be
very
largely
caucasoid.
but
the
community
in
which
he
lives
knows
whether
he's
a
white
man
or
an
indian.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
believe
that
is
a
matter
which
is
well
borne
out
by
census
statistics,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
as
in
the
case
of
metlakatla,
which
was
carved
out
in
the
lands
of
the
tlingit
indians,
a
different
clan
from
the
two
clans
which
here
are
involved.
these
lands
are
lie
pretty
close
to
seattle
by
the
side
of
the
rest
of
alaska.
it's
in
the
southeast
portion
of
alaska.
they
lie
southwest
of
juno.
they're
on
the
inland
passages,
the
islands
in
from
the
ocean
itself.
these
are
people
who
have
been
gaining
a
living
in
very
large
measure
from
fish
since
time
in
memorial.
they
still
are.
they
finally
were
provided
with
more
modern
equipment
by
the
united
states.
the
complaints
alleged
that
they're
heavily
in
debt
to
the
united
states
for
this
equipment
too.
it
includes
what
is
necessary
to
tend
their
fish
traps,
to
build
and
tend
their
fish
traps,
because
i
do
understand
they're
built
annually.
they
had
been
being
built
when
this
case
arose
and
as
soon
as
they
were
put
in
place,
then
the
actions
took
place
which
precipitated
(voice

--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
--
in
the
federal
supplement,
the
tlingit
and
haida
indians
of
alaska
is
177
f.supp.452.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
is
number
47,900
decided
october
7th,
1959
and
appears
in
a
122-page
pamphlet
with
many
attended
maps.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes,
sir.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
they
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
the
governor's
brief
is
(inaudible)
with
the
reasons
for
the
state
action.
the
fact
is
that
over
a
number
of
years
as
a
political
fact
of
life
in
alaska,
there
has
been
terrific
resentment
of
trap
fishing.
and
this
is
a
matter
of
popular
demand
than
the
population
might
say
in
alaska.
it
takes
a
good
deal
or
capital
to
run
a
modern
big
fish
trap.
to
be
sure
these
people
fished
with
a
trap
before
the
white
man
first
showed
up
and
marked
the
traps
we're
talking
about
now.
it
takes
a
good
deal
of
capital.
it's
extremely
efficient.
it
also
can
be
regulated
with
great
care
to
make
sure
that
the
proper
runs
reach
upstairs,
but
not
every
man
can
indulge
it.
there
are
a
limited
number
of
trap
sites.
he,
who
gets
there
first,
under
the
law
of
alaska,
were
told
by
appellees'
brief,
would
have
the
prior
right.
here
is
a
matter
of
spreading
out
the
use
so
that
everyone
can
take
part
of
it.
i
might
think
it's
simply
a
matter
of
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
justice,
i
understand
my
best
information
and
there's
a
letter
appended
to
mr.
schifter's
brief
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
which
rather
disputes
that.
i
understand
the
conservationists
are
hardly
in
favor
fish
traps.
their
--
they
can
be
controlled
absolutely
to
make
certain
that
the
runs
of
fish
go
upstream.
you
can't
control
it
if
every
man
can
hire
a
seine,
can
get
out
there
and
seine
up
the
last
fish.
also,
they
don't
destroy
fish.
they
--
the
fish
are
kept
alive
and
uninjured
to
the
very
time
they're
processed.
it
is
not
my
understanding
that
there
is
any
conservation
issue
in
a
matter
of
this
kind.
there
is
--
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
a
decided
political
issue.
the
state
wants
to
close
them
up
and
it
wants
to
close
them
up
in
the
worst
possible
way.
these
people
want
to
maintain
their
traps
as
their
only
way
of
paying
off
their
debts
and
making
their
livelihood.
the
whole
village
is
employed.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
no.
i
--
i
don't
mean
party.
i
mean
the
--
the
demand
of
the
electorate
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
--
that
this
be
done.
now,
i
may
say
that
there
are
statements
in
the
brief
of
appellee
in
that
regard
which
are
contrary
to
my
information.
i'm
sorry.
i've
never
been
to
alaska.
i
haven't
seen
this
and
a
lot
of
things
i
can't
vouch
for.
but
it's
my
clear
of
understanding
that
it
is
not
true
that
these
people,
themselves,
want
to
abolish
fish
traps.
they
can
do
so,
i
think,
without
question,
but
as
the
complaints
alleged
the
whole
community
depends
on.
the
women
who
come
in
and
fillet
and
otherwise
process
and
can
the
fish,
the
men
who
man
the
boats
and
crafts,
they're
all
concerned
with
it
and
need
and
want
it.
i
think
the
complaints
themselves
speak
for
the
native
attitude.
i
didn't
want,
by
what
i
said,
to
say
that
i
associated
myself
with
all
what
was
said
on
this
subject
in
the
brief
of
appellee.
as
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
there
has
been
some
correspondents
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
arising
since
this
court
postponed
the
merits
with
regard
to
certain
action
in
which
these
people
were
said
to
have
joined
by
the
alaska
native
brotherhood
calling
upon
the
secretary
to
abolish
fish
traps.
i
did
look
into
that
and
if
the
report
was
totally
false
and
secretary
said
that
he
had
looked
into
it
and
found
the
same
thing.
it
simply
isn't
true.
these
people
need
and
want
to
save
their
livelihood
in
the
shape
of
their
fish
traps.
have
i
fully
answered,
mr.
justice
frankfurter?
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
i
only
regret
that
this
complaint
was
drafted
in
such
a
hurry
and
before
the
case
shaped
up
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
because
i'm
certain
it
should
have
put
a
great
deal
more
flesh
on
it.
the
briefs
of
both
the
state
and
the
united
states
take
a
view
that
i
wanted
to
distinguish
in
which
have
been
the
subject
of
a
reply
brief,
filed
here,
a
night
for
it
last.
on
whether
we
have
any
rights
at
all,
whether
kake
and
angoon
have
any
rights.
the
state
says,
“well
if
you
read
section
4
of
the
statehood
act,
it
reserves
property
and
it
reserves
jurisdiction
over
property
including
fishing
rights
of
indians,
only
if
you
got
rights.”
and
the
solicitor
general
reads
that
to
say
“well
that
means
that
congress
has
reserved
to
itself
the
question
whether
it
will
ever
recognize
rights.”
the
state
says,
“these
people
have
no
rights.”
i've
been
to
some
pains
on
that.
and
because
of
a
question
asked
to
mr.
schifter
whether
these
were
reservations
in
the
technical
sense,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
a
little
further
to
it.
actually,
indian
rights
do
not
depend
upon
reservations.
this
court,
itself,
repeatedly
has
recognized
the
rights
of
indians
quite
apart
from
reservations.
in
united
states
as
guardian
of
the
walapai
indians
against
the
santa
fe
pacific
railroad
company,
an
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
and
as
i
recall
for
a
unanimous
court.
the
court,
by
injunction,
protected
mere
rights
of
aboriginal
use
in
occupancy,
aboriginal
possession.
it
didn't
do
that
on
the
theory
that
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
tell
them
unless
congress
established
a
reservation,
but
on
the
ground
that
there
were
rights
there
which
were
to
be
protected
under
federal
law
unless
to
be
sure
congress
does
a
way
with
it.
now,
i
would
not
like
my
understanding
of
one
answer
that
mr.
schifter
gave
to
be
associated
with
my
possession
either.
i
don't
think
that
the
united
states
can
take
those
aboriginal
rights
as
a
matter
which
does
not
create
in
the
indians
some
right
of
compensation.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no,
there
is
no
treaty
so
far
as
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no,
not
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no,
sir.
in
any
indian
case
whatever,
this
court
has
ruled
very
flatly
in
lone
wolf
against
hitchcock,
which
was
cited
by
mr.
schifter,
that
--
that's
a
political
question.
it
has
really
been
the
achilles
heel
of
indian
tribes
in
this
country.
the
united
states
goes
out
and
makes
treaties
with
them.
the
united
states
turns
around
and
with
no
regard
for
that
treaty,
takes
their
land.
the
indian
comes
into
court
and
said
i
want
to
stop
in
taking
if
they
agreed
not
to
and
the
court
says
no.
that's
a
political
question.
you
shall
have
to
appeal
to
the
political
departments
of
the
government.
lone
wolf
against
hitchcock
is
flatly
in
point
there.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
nobody
else
can
take
aboriginal
lands
from
the
indian,
if
the
united
states
will
protect
so
held
in
lane
against
pueblo
of
santa
rosa,
by
this
court.
there,
the
indians
came
to
court
to
enjoin
a
private
person
coming
on
their
lands,
not
the
united
states.
but
the
trouble
with
indian
rights
is
not
that
it
isn't
a
right
because
there
isn't
a
reservation.
it's
because
there
can
be
no
enforcement
of
that
right,
if
congress
says
something
else.
that
the
political
department
said,
“we
abolish
any
tribal
or
clan
property
in
these
indians
and
you
don't
get
anything
for
it.”
there
simply
is
no
question
that
congress
has
the
power
to
do
that.
i
merely
wanted
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
power,
which
is
a
political
power
not
subject
to
review
by
this
court
and
the
right
--
the
right
does
exist
and
were
congress
to
waive
away
the
political
overtones
to
it,
this
court
has
and
can
see
that
compensation
or
protection
has
afforded
those
rights.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
believe
not.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
think
that
alaska
almost
contends
that,
though
i
would
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
would
like
appellee
to
address
this
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
they
assert
there
are
no
rights,
hence,
if
you
reserve
in
section
4
of
the
rights
of
indians.
you'll
reserve
nothing.
and
that
is
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
--
the
reading
i
give
of
their
position.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
do
believe
that
those
rights
do
exist
here
and
they
cannot
or
ought
not
be
mistaken
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
are
political
rights
and
raise
political
problems.
they're
also,
from
time
to
time,
has
been
a
discussion
of
two
sections
of
the
statehood
act
in
conjunction
with
one
another
to
which
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly.
section
4
now,
which
i
--
to
which
i
have
referred
and
which
appears
at
page
5
of
our
separate
appendix,
makes
it
a
compact
with
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
alaska
to
disclaim
land
or
other
property
including
fishing
rights,
that
right
or
title
to
which
maybe
held
by
indians,
eskimos
or
aleuts,
hereinafter
called
natives,
or
is
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
with
them.
now,
we
move
to
section
6
which
is
on
the
next
page,
page
6,
there
is
provided
there
that
the
--
the
first
proviso
near
the
bottom
of
the
page
that
“the
administration
and
management
of
fish
and
wildlife
shall
be
retained
by
the
federal
government
under
existing
laws
until
90
days
after
the
secretary
of
the
interior
certifies
to
congress
that
the
state
was
in
a
position
to
take
over.”
secretary
did
so
certify,
the
state
did
take
over,
january
of
this
year
and
the
point
was
raised
at
some
length
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
that
that
would
make
this
case
moot
because
asserted
--
assuredly,
the
state
now
has
jurisdiction.
i
believe
it's
impossible
to
read
those
statutes,
one,
as
nullifying
the
other.
the
disclaimer
is
not
until
the
state
jurisdiction
of
ordinary
fishing
game
department
duties
which
section
6
is
talking
about
where
the
secretary
enforces
regulation
and
ceased
to
the
policing
of
alaskan
fish
and
game
until
the
state's
able
to
take
over.
this
disclaimer
is
of
all
lands
and
properties
in
the
--
either
held
by
the
indians
or
by
the
united
states
entrust
for
them
and
then
goes
on
to
other
clause
by
which
it
is
agreed
that
they
shall
remain
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states
until
disposed
of
under
its
authority
and
i
feel
that
its
plain
on
that
that
the
--
section
6
did
not
take
away
what
had
just
been
reserved
in
section
4.
it's
talking
about
something
deeper,
the
broad
reach
of
fish
and
game
duties.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes,
sir.
and
that's
been
used
in
--
in
a
number
of
the
statehood
acts,
as
a
compact.
and
i
may
say
that
some
more
reservations
of
the
rights
of
indians
have
been
made
time
and
again
in
state
admission
rights.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
believe
it's
conventional.
i
have
seen
it
in
others
in
the
course
of
reading
the
cases
on
the
effect
of
the
reservation.
and
sometimes
it's
been
called
in
the
statute,
a
solemn
compact.
i
think
that
was
the
case
with
coyle
oklahoma
where
they
solemnly
agreed
that
the
capital
should
not
be
removed
from
(inaudible)
for
a
number
of
years.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
if
the
court
please,
mr.
schifter
has
requested
that
i
reply
for
the
appellants
in
number
326
as
well
as
in
327
under
represented
by
me.
he
particularly
requested
--
i'm
told
by
counsel
for
alaska
that
there
is
some
question
up
there
as
to
whether
the
appeals
taken
by
these
appellants
to
the
supreme
court
was
timely
under
the
court's
rules
which
gave
a
retroactive
right
of
appeal
after
we
had
already
come
here.
i
was
not
aware.
those
appeals
were
filed
the
very
day
that
counsel
were
served
with
the
reply
to
the
briefs
filed
by
appellants
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
they
--
i
said
they
were
filed.
they
were
prepared
and
they
were
mailed
from
washington,
airmails
as
a
precautionary
matter
to
be
sure
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
these
people
did
have
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
which
certainly
was
--
i
must
disagree,
it
was
in
existence.
it
simply
wasn't
organized
under
the
alaska
law.
it
was
created
by
the
constitution
no
judges,
no
clerks.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no,
that's
perfectly
true.
you
could
not
but
i
--
i
was
starting
another
thought.
i
interrupted
myself
really,
mr.
justice.
and
the
other
thought
was
this
that
you
won't
see
the
predicament
of
counsel
for
these
appellants,
has
now
suggested
that
retroactive
right
of
appeal
has
give
--
been
given.
we
see,
there's
three
or
four
days
when
this
first
comes
to
our
attention
within
which
we
might
take
that
appeal.
we
mailed
off
a
notice
of
appeal
without
copies
of
the
rules,
without
copies
of
forms
or
anything
else
airmailed
asking
them
to
be
docketed
although
we
were
not
members
of
that
bar.
it's
a
rather
desperate
thing
if
you
look
it
apply
to
these
indians
and
this
court
should
throw
them
out
here,
then
this
matter
is
res
judicata.
we
never
get
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
legal
issue
has
been
forever
determined
and
we
have
been
denied
the
review.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
think
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
it
wouldn't
now.
i
say
that
if
we
have
not
taken
the
appeal
and
this
court
denied
jurisdiction,
then
we
would
be
foreclosed
forever
on
these
issues
of
law.
that
motivated
us
to
file
an
appeal
if
we
could
to
ask
with
our
non-membership
in
the
bar
be
waived
and
to
ask
would
be
postponed
pending
determination
on
the
issue.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
[laughs]
i'm
quite
aware
of
that,
mr.
justice,
and
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
sir.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
have
no
information
as
to
the
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
supreme
of
court
of
alaska
shall
have
to
defer
that
to
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that's
correct,
sir.
[laughter]
so
as
ours
your
honor
but
our
state
supreme
court
was
in
session.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
schifter
had
requested
that
i
read
the
following
paragraph
from
an
affidavit
of
the
mayor
of
the
metlakatlan
indian
community
which
appears
at
page
37
of
the
record.
and
that's
the
first
transcript
of
record,
not
the
supplemental.
it
has
been
referred
to
persistently
as
raising
a
question
of
a
concession
on
the
part
of
metlakatla.
the
final
paragraph
in
that
affidavit
says
that
the
purpose
in
seeking
ban
on
the
use
of
fish
traps
in
alaska
was
to
conserve
the
runs
of
salmon.
that
the
use
and
operation
of
the
four
fish
traps
of
the
community
--
well
in
but
a
very
minor
manner
if
any
affect
the
conservation
of
salmon
in
alaska
waters.
that
the
state
of
alaska
will
not
suffer
any
material
damage
if
the
traps
are
permitted
to
be
operated
while
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
indians
of
the
reservation
are
denied
the
right,
they
will
suffer
irreparable
damage
and
loss.
it's
his
feeling
that
a
good
deal
of
moral
was
read
into
that
paragraph
than
the
paragraph
deserved.
i
want
to
recur
to
the
references
that
had
been
made
to
the
basis
of
the
secretary's
action
in
authorizing
these
fish
traps.
i
think
perhaps
it's
best
shown
by
the
new
regulations
which
are
proposed
and
in
the
red
appendix
at
page
34
and
35.
we
find
the
places
set
forth
in
the
federal
register
as
is
required.
we
find
that
the
authority
is
not
merely
the
white
act
to
which
reference
was
made
but
that
it
comes
under
section
2
and
9
of
title
25,
section
485
of
title
5
and
cites
other
acts.
now,
i
think
that
a
little
more
could
have
been
said
on
title
5
of
the
u.s.code.
they
cite
section
485
which
says
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
charged
with
the
supervision
of
public
business
relating
to
the
following
subjects
first
and
then
second,
the
indians.
they
did
not
cite
section
22,
the
so-called
housekeeping
statute
on
departmental
regulations
which
applies
to
all
departments
and
says,
“the
head
of
each
department
is
authorized
to
prescribe
regulations
not
inconsistent
with
law
for
the
government
of
his
department
and
the
performance
of
business
and
two
or
three
other
including
custodial
matters.
the
sections
with
respect
to
title
25
of
the
code,
title
25
as
indians,
section
2
which
is
cited
in
this
assertion
of
authority
on
the
part
of
the
interior
--
of
the
secretary,
says,
“the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
shall,
under
the
direction
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
agreeable
to
such
rule
regulations
as
the
president
may
prescribe
in
the
management
of
all
indian
affairs
and
of
all
matters
arising
out
of
indian
relations.”
and
the
other
sections,
section
9,
the
president
may
prescribe
such
regulations
as
he
may
think
that
for
carrying
into
effect
to
the
various
provisions
of
any
act
relating
to
indian
affairs
and
for
the
settlement
of
the
accounts
of
indian
affairs.
the
next
item
on
which
i
was
concerned
arose
in
response
to
some
questions
of
mr.
justice
douglas
respecting
hynes
against
grimes
pack
--
and
refer
to
the
fact
that
he
had
decided
that
the
court's
opinion
is
something
else.
i
must
confess
that
i
have
the
same
misunderstanding
of
the
holding
in
hynes
against
grimes
packing
as
had
mr.
justice
douglas
if
i
understood
correctly
his
questions
until
i
got
around
to
studying
it
for
the
sake
in
this
case.
hynes
against
grimes
packing
held
very
flatly
concluding
at
page
116
that
there
was
a
valid
establishment
of
an
indian
reservation
at
karluk
in
alaska.
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
did
have
authority
to
establish
it,
but
it
then
went
on
to
hold
concluding
at
pages
122
and
123
not
as
i
have
sort
of
vaguely
recalled
the
court
held
and
as
i
believe
we
shared
by
one
member
of
this
court
but
to
say
we
find
nothing
in
the
white
act
that
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
grant
reservation
occupants
the
privilege
of
exclusive
commercial
fishing
rights.
now,
the
holding
of
that
case
is
not
as
i
understand
it
but
because
of
the
white
act,
no
such
rights
could
be
accorded
by
the
secretary
but
that
he
had
ceased
the
wrong
authority
and
you
couldn't
say
that
the
white
act
authorized
him
to
put
an
exclusive
right
in
the
hands
of
the
natives.
he
would
have
to
look
elsewhere
and
the
balance
of
the
opinion
carries
that
distinction
through
all
of
it.
i've
been
further
concerned
with
the
references
that
would
indicate
that
while
metlakatla
may
very
well
be
confined
to
the
island
down
there
that
southern
tip
of
alaska
where
it
lies
for
each
fish
traps,
that
somehow
under
kake
and
angoon
have
a
role
making
profit
to
go
all
over
alaska
and
fish,
fish
traps
wherever
they
want
to.
i
wish
to
call
attention
to
the
president
proposed
regulations,
if
i
may,
at
pages
36
and
37
of
this
red
appendix.
the
court
will
see
that
as
to
kake
and
angoon,
i
omitted
of
course,
the
ones
respecting
metlakatla
then
in
mr.
schifter's
brief,
the
locations
of
the
21
traps,
or
as
distinctly
specified
by
latitude
and
longitude
down
to
the
second
and
they
can't
operate
the
21.
they're
permitted
to
be
permitted
in
this
season
to
operate
only
13
in
all.
i
further
wish
to
call
attention
to
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
there
are
--
there
are
13
traps
which
are
authorized
to
be
fished
in
this
season
but
there
are
only
21
sites
that
the
secretary
permits.
if
i
may
have
had
a
slip
of
the
tongue
referring
to
time
instead
of
number
of
traps,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
can't
answer
that
definitively.
it
is
my
recollection
that
they
are
so
specified
with
regard
to
indian
sites.
i
would
have
to
get
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
believe
that's
correct
but
there
again,
i
--
what's
that?
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i‘m
informed
by
mr.
schifter
that
he
can
say
that
all
fishing
trap
sites
were
specified
either
white
or
indian.
these
indians,
of
course,
set
by
here
for
quite
a
while
and
watched
non-indians
fishing
the
traps,
which
later
was
the
cannery
were
purchased
by
the
united
states
and
turned
over
to
indian
fishing.
however,
the
fact
is
that
as
to
indians
since
the
secretary
exceeded
the
closing
up
all
fish
traps
except
indian
fish
traps,
the
secretary
has
very
directly
regulated
it.
this
is
not
an
unregulated
right
if
that
impression
has
been
given
this
court.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
manifestly
concerned
with
the
matter.
he
has
fish
and
wildlife
under
his
jurisdiction.
he
is
manifestly
concerned
with
preserving
the
salmon
lives
there
as
necessary
to
kake
and
angoon
and
the
metlakatla
as
they
can't
be
to
anyone
else
in
alaska
and
they
are
regulated
by
the
secretary.
the
size
of
the
traps
is
unimportant,
i
suggest.
the
question
is
how
many
fish
you
take
out
of
them,
not
what
gear
you
use
and
traps
can
be
regulated
and
are
regulated
to
determine
how
much
of
a
pack
you
take
out
of
them.
it's
no
different
if
you
spread
it
amongst
more
men
perhaps
running
the
actual
boats
and
they
take
just
as
many
fish
with
yawl
nets
or
purse
seines
or
some
other
method,
we're
really
confusing
to
quite
different
issues.
i
repeat
again
that
in
my
judgment,
there
is
no
conservation
issue
here
unless
alaska
can
say
“well,
the
secretary
isn't
going
to
regulate
this
from
a
conservation
standpoint
but
we
would.”
unless
that
can
be
said,
i
--
i
don't
see
how
this
issue
can
be
imported
into
the
case.
and
there
was
one
other
thing
that
occurred
to
me
in
that
connection
when
it
was
said
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that
is
the
theory
of
the
alaskan
legislation.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
believe
that
the
issue
of
conservation
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
they
--
the
only
matter
from
conservation
standpoint
that
appeals
to
make
and
make
any
sense
is
the
number
of
fish
you
catch
and
the
number
you
left
through
the
ghost
pond
and
how
carefully
you
regulate
it.
now,
our
grant
that
dynamite
is
forbidden
under
the
interior
department
regulations
as
under
the
state,
that
is
a
highly
nonselective
method
of
regulating
fish.
i
suppose
it
could
be
used
but
it's
--
it's
frowned
upon.
now,
alaska
certainly
frowns
upon
the
use
of
fish
traps
but
i
am
unaware,
provided
they
are
regulated
and
here
they
are
regulated
that
there
can
be
possibly
be
any
issue
other
than
how
many
fish
you
take
by
one
method
or
the
other
and
how
you
let
you
runs
a
fish
through
this
pond.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
certainly
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
certainly,
the
traps
are
more
efficient.
they
require
fewer
men.
there
are
more
capital
investment
in
them
but
they
have
fewer
man
to
run
them.
they
efficiently
supply
the
cannery.
there's
very
little
loss
from
injured
fish
as
there
are
by
any
other
method
of
fishing.
they
are
efficient.
they've
been
proved
that
over
a
long
time.
and
now
we
have
from
eight
to
11
traps,
13
this
year
permitted
to
operate
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
we
have
up
over
200
authorized,
only
two
and
three
and
four
and
five
years
ago.
the
numbers
are
set
forth
in
two
different
appendices
to
the
briefs,
one
mr.
schifter's
and
one
in
my
brief
and
shows
the
rather
de
minimis
nature
of
what
is
left
here
but
it
is
not,
even
what
we
have
here
an
unregulated
right.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
looking
after
this
right.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i'll
so
read
it
if
you
take
it
in
conjunction
with
subparagraph
(e),
two
pages
later,
page
37
of
the
red
appendix
during
the
1960
fishing
season
only
the
following
--
and
you
count
up
in
there
13
out
of
the
21.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
justice,
it's
inconceivable
to
me.
certainly,
if
these
people
have
a
small
remnant
of
the
aboriginal
right
that
they
once
possessed,
it
would
relate
only
to
their
own
area
and
it
doesn't
infest
all
alaska.
they
tried
in
this
country
with
particular
fishing
rights
as
limited
and
usually
to
a
particular
area.
we
--
this
court
has
dealt
with
many
of
them,
the
wyman's
case
and
the
seufert
case,
the
tulee
case.
they're
not
unfamiliar,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
have
a
right
to
go
into
somebody
else's
theory
and
fish
there.
it's
not
a
profit
good
for
all
of
alaska.
it's
a
profit
within
their
own
area
and
of
the
overwhelming,
both
of
these
300
traps
were
white,
they're
closed
down.
secretary
here
has
identified
only
21
sites
that
can
be
fished.
that's
all
around
in
alaska.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
shall
have
--
mr.
calhoun
indicated,
i
don't
believe
he
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
are
in
entire
agreement.
this
is
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
--
one
of
those
things
where
i
can
just
sit
on
the
sidelines
and
grin
to
all
of
the
smugly
act,
let
the
complaint
of
that.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
wanted
too
to
counter
one
statement
that
was
made
in
the
course
of
mr.
rader's
argument
about
whether
kake
and
angoon
ever
fished
with
traps.
i
found
in
the
findings
of
fact
to
the
court
of
claims
on
its
october
7
opinion
in
tlingit
and
haida
that
i
cited
earlier.
page
59,
finding
41,
the
following
sentence
the
indians
referring
to
the
tlingit
indians
use
hook
and
line,
spears,
gill
nets
and
that
strategic
stations
along
the
coast
and
rivers
wears
and
traps.
traps
weren't
under
many
on
the
many
aborigines
on
the
united
states
but
our
grant,
these
are
a
bigger
more
costly
and
culturally,
greatly
developed
trap
by
the
side
of
the
aboriginal
traps
which
had
to
be
hand
woven
mainly.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
fishery
including
other
rights.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
am
not
aware
that
the
government
takes
that
position,
although
i'm
bound
to
confess,
i
do
not
represent
the
indians
in
that
case
and
i
don't
want
to
be
held
to
it.
i
would
have
to
consult
counsel
in
that
case.
i
must
say
this
that
in
a
reference
and
their
note
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae
in
the
district
court,
the
government
doesn't
intimate
that
it
contest
a
right
of
recovery.
and
since
congress
authorized
the
suite
for
aboriginal
rights
there,
i
take
it
there
would
be
no
question
raised
on
that
issue.
well
now,
i
was
concerned
too
about
another
aspect
to
mr.
rader's
argument
which
intimated
that
what
is
involved
here
is
just
a
seattle
operation
perhaps
in
the
name
of
the
indians.
i'd
been
hampered
by
not
much
knowledge
outside
that
the
record
in
these
cases
but
certainly
as
far
as
the
record
goes,
a
supplemental
transcript
in
the
complaints
of
kake
which
commences
at
page
82
and
the
complaint
of
angoon
which
commences
at
102
in
paragraphs
one,
two,
three
and
four,
plainly
and
explicitly
point
out
that
this
is
an
indian
operation
in
which
substantially,
the
whole
village
is
engaged
and
on
which
that
villagers'
income
and
well-being
depends.
in
concluding,
i
think
perhaps
i
ought
to
share
with
the
court
an
outrageous
pond
that
lurks
in
the
record
in
this
case
which
was
brought
to
my
attention
by
an
assistance
solicitor
and
interior
in
the
suit
of
kake
and
angoon
against
egan
governor.
he
said
the
question
here
was
whether
these
indians
could
have
their
kake
and
egan
too.
