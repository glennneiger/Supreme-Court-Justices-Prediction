mr.
john
d.
calhoun
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appears
in
this
proceeding
as
amicus
curiae.
it
appears
in
support
of
the
position
of
appellants.
it
asks
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
of
this
argument
to
comment
briefly
on
the
jurisdictional
question
that
this
court
reserved
in
its
order
of
december
7th,
setting
this
case
for
argument.
i
would
agree
with
mr.
schifter,
that
the
brief
most
recently
filed
by
the
state
of
alaska
has
rather
much
resolved
all
the
questions
that
may
have
existed
in
december.
i
would,
however,
like
to
put
the
position
of
the
government
on
this
jurisdictional
point,
because
the
government
is
satisfied
that
in
this
case,
the
united
states
supreme
court
does
have
jurisdiction.
the
brief
for
alaska,
adopting
the
position
that
the
united
states
took
last
july,
when
it
was
asked
to
comment
upon
this
case,
concedes
that
under
the
statehood
act
and
under
the
existing
laws
of
alaska,
the
court
below
was
created
as
a
state
court.
moreover,
that
the
court
below
was
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
alaska,
the
time
of
judgment
below
was
entered,
at
the
time
the,
restraining
order
was
requested
and
granted
by
this
court.
at
the
time
the
appeals
to
this
court
were
perfected
and
more
importantly,
throughout
the
90-day
period
in
which
the
parties
to
this
action
had
to
come
to
this
court
if
they
were
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
there
can
be
no
question
that
there
was
drawn
into
question
below,
the
validity
of
state
statutes
in
the
ground
that
they
were
repugnant
to
statutes
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
that
the
court
below
resolved
those
questions
in
favor
of
the
state
statutes.
every
element
necessary
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
section
1257
title
28
has
been
made.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
my
recollection
is,
your
honor,
that
there
are
60
days.
now,
though
the
rule,
the
pertinent
rule
here
is
rule
54
(b)
of
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
alaska.
under
that
rule,
rule
54
(b),
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
permitted
anybody
who
--
any
--
any
case
which
a
judgment
had
been
entered
prior
to
the
effective
date
to
file
on
the
effective
date
as
if
that
was
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment.
and
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
has,
in
fact,
heard
some
appeals
from
cases
decided
by
the
interim
court.
but
the
point
was
these
people
could
not
have
been
in
the
supreme
court
at
anytime,
at
anytime
under
those
rules.
and
i
think
that's
conclusive
on
the
point
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
yes.
they
would've
had
a
right
of
review
under
what
they
knew
as
of
october
5th.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
but
--
but
they
didn't
know
that
that
would
be
the
case
for
a
certainty
on
september
30th,
when
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
--
they
expired.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
to
be
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
yes.
under
rule
54
(b),
that
rule
is
set
forth
in
full
at
page
22
of
the
red
appendix
filed
for
appellants,
kake
and
angoon.
now,
i
should
like
to
turn
to
the
--
as
i
have
indicated,
the
government
agrees
with
the
basic
position
of
the
appellants
in
this
case.
it
does
however
reach
that
result
by
somewhat
different
route
and
they
have
tried
--
disagrees
with
certain
assumptions
and
assertions
they
have
made.
that
i
will
have
occasion
later
in
the
course
of
this
argument
to
comment
on
those
differences
that
we
have
with
the
appellants,
indeed,
to
comment
on
in
a
difference
that
the
united
states
and
the
department
of
justice
has
so
far
as
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
but
for
the
moment,
i
would
like
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
yes.
our
position
is
not
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
--
precisely
that
of
the
department
of
interior.
and
i
would
like
to
make
that
clear
to
the
court.
for
the
moment,
however,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
--
state
my
position
first.
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
section
4
of
the
statehood
act
held
in
status
quo,
federal
right
in
and
control
over
all
indian
fishing
rights
in
the
state
of
alaska.
position
--
this
position
is
borne
out
both
by
the
language
of
the
statute
and
by
its
legislative
history.
now,
the
precise
terms
of
section
4
from
which
the
government
relies
and
they
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
13
are
these,
they're
very
short.
“lands
or
other
property
including
fishing
rights,
the
right
or
title
to
which
maybe
held
by
said
natives
or
is
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
said
natives,
shall
be
and
remain
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states
until
disposed
of
under
its
authority.”
there's
the
statutory
language
upon
which
we
relied
to
give
us
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
over
indian
fishing
rights
in
alaska.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
phrase,
“fishing
rights,”
of
which
section
4
speaks,
are
not
true
property
rights,
legal
rights,
proprietary
interest,
the
taking
of
which
would
create
a
duty
of
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
rather,
we
use
rights
and
rights
were
used
in
that
statute
for
our
intention,
in
a
broader
sense,
in
the
sense
of
fishing
privileges.
now,
in
this
very
area,
its
not
--
it's
not
uncommon
to
speak
of
nonproprietary
interests
as
rights.
i
might
point
out
that
this
court
in
the
tee-hit-ton
case,
a
case
decided
just
before
--
shortly
before
the
language
in
here
was
affirmed
up
as
--
as
to
be
permanently
in
the
statehood
act.
this
court
had
the
occasion
to
say
in
tee-hit-ton,
speaking
of
indian
title
which
is
a
--
a
privilege
based
on
aboriginal
use
and
possession.
this
is
not
a
property
right,
but
amounts
to
a
right
of
occupancy
which
the
sovereign
grants
and
protects
against
intrusion
by
third
parties
of
which
right
of
occupancy
maybe
terminated
in
such
lands
fully
disposed
of
by
the
sovereign
itself
without
any
legally
enforceable
obligations
to
compensate
the
indian.
tee-hit-ton
is
a
case,
when
you
read
the
legislative
history
of
a
statehood
act
that
was
right
in
the
forefront
of
the
minds
of
the
legislators.
they
knew
when
they
spoke
of
rights
in
alaska,
in
indians,
that
they
weren't
talking
about
compensable
rights.
now,
as
i
have
said,
our
construction
phrase,
“fishing
rights,”
accords
with
congressional
intent.
let
me
comment
for
a
moment
on
some
of
that
legislative
history.
the
phrase
including
fishing
rights
was
put
in
to
alaska
statehood
act
in
the
senate,
in
the
81st
congress
and
the
report
of
the
committee
that
framed
this
--
of
this
section,
reads
as
follows.
i'm
speaking
of
the
bill
that
it
provides,
“for
transfer
to
the
state
of
highly
important
alaskan
fisheries
and
wildlife,
except
those
which
are
subject
to
international
agreement
or
are
included
within
the
reserved
native
rights.”
in
the
84th
congress,
the
congress
before
the
alaska
statehood
act
was
enacted,
the
house
report
on
the
bill,
the
same
language
had
survived
through
the
81st
and
on
into
the
84th
congress,
had
this
to
say,
“it
is
provided
that
no
attempt
will
be
made
to
deal
with
the
legal
merits
of
the
indigenous
rights,
but
to
leave
the
matter
in
status
quo
for
either
further
legislative
action
or
judicial
determination.”
those
very
words
were
picked
up
in
the
house
report
in
the
85th
congress,
the
congress
that
enacted
the
alaska
statehood
bill.
the
substance
of
those
words
were
picked
up
in
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
in
the
85th
congress
that
voted
out
the
alaska
statehood.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
it
is
provided
from
the
--
it
is
provided
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
to
deal
with
the
legal
merits
of
the
indigenous
right
native
--
native
rights
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
--
but
to
leave
the
matter
in
status
quo
for
either
further
legislative
action
or
judicial
determination.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
yes.
and
until
congress
speaks
the
statehood
act
keeps
in
status
quo
of
indian
fishing
privileges
too.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
it's
certainly
the
position
of
the
government
that
you
need
not
reach
it
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
--
to
the
extent
that
--
that
alaska
urges
that
property
rights,
as
set
forth
in
the
statehood
act
mean
that
they
have
to
be
vested
proprietary
interests.
that
question
is
thrust
upon
you,
but
i
cannot
--
we
think
that's
a
very
tortured
construction
of
--
of
the
statehood
act,
because
the
congress
with
the
tee-hit-ton
case
before
it
knew
there
were
no
such
indian
rights
in
alaska.
it
would've
been
speaking
an
absurdity,
if
it
--
if
it
has
intended
that
those
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
i
had
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
no.
well,
you
will
notice
that
in
the
statehood
act,
it
speaks
of
land
or
property
made
the
right
entitled
maybe
in
the
indians
or
is
in
the
united
states.
now,
i
--
if
it
is
necessary,
if
the
court
in
--
in
treating
this
property,
will
find
it
necessary
to
find
it
proprietary
interest
on
which
the
indians
fishing
privilege
may
fight,
i
suggest
that
the
united
states
retained
in
itself
sufficient
proprietary
interests
to
give
the
indian
fishing
privilege
meaning.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
no,
most
certainly
not.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
no.
not,
as
against
the
united
states
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
--
certainly
not.
yes,
i
--
i
thought
it
was
a
--
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
--
question
that
you
had
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
yes.
well,
i
--
even
--
even
that
point
i
--
i
suggest
need
not
be
reached
on
this
case.
but
if,
if
in
conceptualizing
how
the
indian
fishing
privilege
for
which
we
urge
or
which
we
urge
can
be
maybe
meaningful,
it's
necessary
to
find
a
proprietary
interest,
then
i
suggest
that
it's
an
interest
in
the
united
states
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
indeed,
yes.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
you
do.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
my
answer,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
my
--
my
answer,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
only
addressed
to
the
proposition
that
anything
that
you
decide
here
will
not
be
binding
on
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
compensability
of
these
interests.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
i
won't
agree
with
them.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
to
the
proposition
set
forth
in
the
--
in
the
brief
of
alaska.
as
we
read
that
brief,
alaska
disagrees
with
us
in
two
principal
particulars.
the
first
urges
that
the
united
states
has
misconstrued
section
4
of
the
statehood
act.
secondly,
that
section
4
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
schifter,
alluding
to
the
two
theories
of
unconstitutionality,
first
that
the
commerce
power
article
--
article
i,
section
a
clause
3,
does
not
reach
the
type
of
--
of
regulation
that
congress
is
attempting
here
and
secondly,
that
if
it
did,
the
equal
footing
doctrine
would
bar
that
--
the
equal
footing
doctrine
also
bars
the
exercise
of
the
power
to
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
there
--
there,
your
honor,
i
can
only
rely
on
--
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
and
i
cannot
think
of
words
more
absolute
than
that.
and
secondly,
that
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
legislative
history
of
this
enactment,
you
cannot
read
it
without
feeling
that
it
mattered
in
everything
it
was
done,
is
a
--
is
the
thought
that
the
united
states
would
keep
full
supervision
over
the
fishing
of
natives
in
alaskan
waters.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
it
just
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
--
by
difficulty,
does
not
come
with
understanding
the
police
characterization.
it's
whether
--
whether
that
would
be
one
of
the
fishing
privileges
that
--
or
for
fishing
rights
that
was,
in
fact,
reserved.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
no,
i
would
not.
and
here
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
i
would
say
the
state
of
alaska.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
could
not.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
this
court
has
--
has
many
times,
i'm
quite
satisfied
as
it
has
said
that
concern
must
be
shown
for
the
police
power.
has
said
the
congress
is
--
the
--
the
right
of
the
congress
to
operate
in
the
field
of
indian
affairs
is
plenary.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
if
--
if
i
cannot
--
if
i
cannot
rely
on
the
words
as
such,
then
i
can
say
that
so
far
as
this
case
is
--
is
concerned
so
far
as
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
--
this
case
is
concerned,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
was
what
they
had
in
mind
and
we
can
await
the
(voice
overlap)
–
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
turn
to
the
argument
based
on
the
fact
that
the
commerce
power
doesn't
reach
communities
such
as
kake
and
angoon
and
metlakatla,
because
the
--
the
commerce
clause
speaks
of
tribal
indians.
alaska
says
that
all
the
--
all
appellants
have
pleaded
is
that
they
are
federal
indian
corporations
and
then
they
conclude
that
this
is
not
sufficient
to
invoke
the
operation
of
the
commerce
clause.
now,
appellants
were
incorporated
under
section
17
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
as
amended.
under
that
section
as
amended,
secretary
of
the
interior
--
interior
has
authorized
a
charter
as
the
tribes
stay
in
the
group,
indians
in
alaska
having
a
common
bond
of
occupation
or
association
or
residence
within
a
well
defined
neighborhood
community
or
rural
district.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
so
acted
with
respect
to
each
of
the
appellants.
i
do
not
understand
that
alaska
challenges
the
way
the
secretary
exercised
that
authority.
in
other
words,
proofs
are
properly
chartered
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
this
court
has
many
times
held
that
when
congress
identifies
a
group
of
indians
as
being
worthy
of
this
consideration
of
the
commerce
power,
it's
a
political
question
whether
that
entity
exists
and
can
--
can
be
treated
by
the
congressional
power.
and
i
--
i
put
it
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
congress
has
decided
these
are
regulable
indian
groups.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
the
rights
--
the
right
to
fish,
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
privilege
of
fishing,
i
think,
were
traps,
i
mean.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
his
right
to
regulate
how
indians
fish,
derives
from
the
white
act.
he
doesn't
--
indians
have
a
vast
range
of
means
by
which
they
can
fish.
he
may
regulate
any
of
those
means.
now,
their
--
their
privilege
of
fishing,
their
right
to
fish,
comes
as
much
from
their
charters.
their
charter
under
--
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
is
fishing
communities
and
we
--
the
government
has
--
has
purchased
and
holds
in
trust
for
them,
canneries.
implicit
in
their
--
in
their
grouping
is
the
need
to
--
is
the
need
to
fish,
and
necessity
to
fish.
that's
were
the
privilege
comes
from.
now,
the
right
to
regulate
how
they
shall
do
it,
that
congress
has
put
in
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
the
white
act.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
as
i
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
it
--
it
applies
generally
to
all
indians
and
those
are
the
only
persons
left
under
the
regulation
of
the
white
act.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
well,
that
--
that
is
our
construction
and
that's
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
white
act.
the
--
the
intendment
of
section
4
was
to
remove
federal
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
non-native
fishing.
so
that
left
the
--
the
grip
of
the
white
act
only
on
--
on
native
fishing
and
as
to
that,
there
is
--
there
is
no
discrimination
and
so
far
as
hynes
against
grimes
is
this
concerned,
all
it
held
was
that
you
could
not
apply
the
criminal
--
you
cannot
invoke
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
white
act
in
aid
of
exclusive
fishing
privileges
that
congress
had
granted
under
other
statutes.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
it's
--
it's
certainly
contemplated,
we
say,
by
--
by
section
4
of
the
--
of
the
white
act
that
there
be
federal
control
over
indian
fishing.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
looked
to
the
white
act
or
his
authority.
to
be
sure,
the
--
the
power
under
which
congress
would
be
operating
in
the
area
of
the
white
act
would
be
power
probably
under
the
commerce
clause
and
no
longer
under
article
iv,
the
territorial
power
which
it
was
--
which
it
invoke
in
1924
and
enacted
the
white
act,
that
constitutional
basis
doubles
transmuted
by
the
statehood
act.
and
that
maybe
enough
to
distinguish
hynes
against
grimes
there,
because
the
--
the
constitutional
underpinning
is
different
--
is
different
now.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
well,
it
is
general
as
to
all
those
to
whom
it
applies.
it's
--
that
--
that
is
the
position
of
the
government.
it
can't
be
anymore
general
than
--
than
over
the
group
against
whom
it's
directed.
alaska
--
alaska
has
asked
for
and
received
in
the
congress
by
the
grant
of
statehood,
right
to
control
non-native
fishing
and
it
can't
be
discrimination
of
the
united
states
reserves
to
itself,
regulation
over
native
fishing.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
that
is
the
position
of
the
government.
the
second
constitutional
argument
of
alaska,
involves
the
equal
footing
argument.
we
say
here
that
the
coyle
case
makes
perfectly
plain
that
if
congress
is
exercising
--
is
exercising
powers
that
it
clearly
has
under
the
constitution,
the
equal
footing
doctrine
doesn't
come
in
to
operation
and
certainly
the
power
of
the
congress
to
regulate
indian
affairs
is
--
has
long
recognized
as
we've
had
--
had
cases
and
that's
all
that
this
is
a
reservation
of.
the
case
of
ward
against
race
horse,
upon
which
alaska
relies,
is
easily
distinguishable
because
in
the
statehood
act
under
which
wyoming
was
admitted
to
the
union,
there
was
no
exception
in
favor
of
the
federal
government
or
in
favor
of
indians
and
it
was
presumed
by
the
court
that
all
powers
were
transferred
to
wyoming
and
it
could
--
it
could
apply
it's
game
laws
to
indians
who
hunted
off
indian
reservations
or
government
property,
that
had
been
expressly
reserved
for
their
use.
i
see
my
time
is
expiring,
i
would
like
only
to
comment
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
on
the
difference
that
we
have
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
as
we
understand
the
position
of
the
secretary,
it
is
that
his
regulatory
authority
under
the
white
act
is
--
is
locked
in,
petrified
as
--
as
it
was
at
the
moment
of
the
admission
of
alaska
to
statehood.
we
don't
--
so
that
if
there
had
nine
traps
prior
to
admission,
they
--
they
may
have
only
nine
hours.
it's
--
it's
a
little
uncertain
whether
he's
going
up
to
21,
stay
at
nine
though.
we
say
that
he
has
congress'
commanded
him
to
exercise
as
much
discretion
as
he
exercised
before.
nine
traps
are
enough,
then
he
shall
issue
nine
authorizations,
but
if
there
--
if
more
or
--
or
fewer
are
needed,
then
he
must
--
he
must
use
his
discretion
there.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
if
he
follows
the
criteria
that
congress
set
for
him
in
the
white
act,
and
that's
the
regulatory
act,
and
in
the
pursuit
of
his
expert
judgment
in
any
fishing
season,
there
should
be
no
traps
--
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
there
should
be
no
traps,
but
he
applies
the
--
the
standards
of
conservation
in
enforcing
the
law.
mr.
john
d.
calhoun
indeed
not,
your
honor.
