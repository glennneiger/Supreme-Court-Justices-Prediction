are
these
regulations
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
over
the
years,
been
issued
annually?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
fishing
season
each
year?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
pretend
that
this
--
that
these
federal
acts
served
to
create
a
reservation
within
the
--
any
technical
meaning
of
that
word
do
you,
an
indian
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
and
--
whether
they
vested
anything
beyond
mere
fishing
privileges.
justice
potter
stewart
the
annette
islands
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
capitals
are
all
indians,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
than
are
more
--
they're
--
they're
not
eskimos
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
indians.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
speaking,
i
gather,
particularly
of
the
boats
that
--
that
retells
us
we're
taking
them
in
these
communities
in
favored
abolition
of
fish
traps?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
state
law
of
alaska,
how
long
a
period
does
the
appellant
have
in
which
to
appeal
from
the
--
from
this
state
trial
court
to
--
to
the
supreme
court
of
alaska?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
if
you're
--
if
these
are
indian
tribes,
or
assuming
there,
tribes,
then
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
third
argument,
would
you?
wouldn't
you
grant
the
power
of
the
united
states
under
the
--
under
--
under
its
power
to
--
over
commerce
with
indian
tribes
to
--
to
impose
this
kind
of
infringement.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
that
there
had
to
be
a
new
restraint,
i
take
it
or
something
to
prevent
application
of
the
state
laws
since
this
was
last
year.
