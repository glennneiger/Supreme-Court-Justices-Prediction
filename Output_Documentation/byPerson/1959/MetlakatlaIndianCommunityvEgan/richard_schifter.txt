mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
the
court
in
these
consolidated
cases
is
the
right
of
three
indian
fishing
communities
in
alaska
to
maintain
fish
traps
where
the
federal
government
has
specifically
authorized
them
to
maintain
these
traps
and
where
the
state
has
made
it
a
crime
for
them
to
do
so.
it
is
this
conflict
between
state
and
federal
jurisdiction,
between
the
assertions
of
state
and
federal
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
common
question
to
the
two
dockets.
there
is
another
question
as
common
to
both
dockets
concerning
jurisdiction.
the
two
dockets
differ
on
a
question
of
the
origin
of
indian
rights
here
asserted.
and
it
will
be
my
purpose
to
address
myself
first
to
the
common
questions
and
then
to
the
specific
question
in
docket
326.
as
far
as
the
general
background
is
concerned,
all
three
communities
as
i've
indicated
are
fishing
communities,
their
whole
economy
resting
on
fishing
and
canning.
a
key
element
in
this
economic
setup
of
these
communities
are
--
is
a
maintenance
fish
traps.
fish
traps
constitute
an
efficient
way
of
catching
salmon
which
has
proved
inexpensive
or
less
expensive
in
the
long
run
in
maintaining
of
boats.
the
right
for
that
--
of
metlakatla
to
maintain
fish
traps
has
been
authorized
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
for
many
years
and
most
specifically,
was
authorized
in
1959
and
proposed
regulations
have
been
issued
for
the
fishing
season
of
1960,
which
is
about
to
start
authorizing
them
once
again
to
maintain
these
traps.
mr.
richard
schifter
of
the
regulations?
mr.
richard
schifter
which
legislation,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
schifter
oh,
1959,
january
1959.
mr.
richard
schifter
came
in
april
1959,
for
the
1959
season.
mr.
richard
schifter
oh,
yes.
yes.
it's
quite
--
mr.
richard
schifter
it's
quite
clear
that
as
far
as
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
concerned,
he
is
aware
of
the
state
law
in
this
matter
and
issued
the
regulations
in
1959
and
proposes
to
issue
them
once
again
in
1960.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
they
were
issued
in
1959.
again
in
1960,
i
believe
that
there
was
a
general
pattern
over
the
years
for
issuing
regulations
authorizing
the
fish
traps,
a
certain
number
of
fish
traps,
but
the
specific
decision
as
to
how
long
they
will
be
open
and
exactly
which
locations
maybe
operated,
vary
from
year
to
year.
mr.
richard
schifter
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
richard
schifter
--
i
believe
in
1915
as
far
as
metlakatla
is
concerned,
rather
--
recently,
perhaps,
1958
and
1950
as
far
as
the
appellants
in
docket
327
are
concerned.
mr.
richard
schifter
oh,
yes.
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
were
--
these
--
these
fish
traps
were
operated
for
many
years
in
the
past
and
what
happened
in
1959
is
the
secretary
again
did
what
he
had
been
--
done
in
the
previous
years.
mr.
richard
schifter
they
were
general
regulations
which
specifically
mentioned
--
mr.
richard
schifter
--
mentioned
the
traps
at
this
particular
location,
which
will
authorize
the
operator.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
mr.
richard
schifter
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
schifter
there
were
many
more,
yes.
it
was
--
there
were
many
hundreds.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
a
total
of
21
locations
have
been
authorized
over
the
years
at
metlakatla
and
kake
and
angoon.
in
each
instance
though,
each
year,
a
decision
is
made
as
to
exactly
which
of
them
should
be
operated.
for
example,
metlakatla
has
eight
authorized
locations
which
have
been
authorized
for
a
good
number
of
years.
last
year,
four
of
them
were
authorized
to
--
to
open.
this
year
again,
it
is
proposed
to
--
to
open
only
four
of
them
incidentally,
for
--
one
of
them
is
a
different
one
from
the
one
that
was
allowed
to
open
last
year.
mr.
richard
schifter
as
far
as
docket
326
is
concerned,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
richard
schifter
that
is
the
issue
in
the
case.
their
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
--
mr.
richard
schifter
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
today
claims
only
the
right
to
do
this
because
it
is
a
state.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
richard
schifter
well,
the
--
mr.
richard
schifter
that
is
the
question.
mr.
richard
schifter
oh,
yes,
yes.
the
--
as
i've
indicated,
the
operation
of
the
--
the
traps
is
vital
to
the
--
these
indian
communities
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
they
have
sought
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws
of
alaska
against
them.
while
vital
to
the
community,
i
should
add
and
the
record
indicates
that
the
total
trap
catch
at
metlakatla
constitutes
less
than
1%
of
the
total
catch
of
the
entire
state.
there
is
a
jurisdictional
matter
in
this
case
which
is
a
unique
problem
arising
from
the
statehood
act.
the
parties
and
the
amicus
have
now
agreed
and
fully
concur
in
the
fact
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
judgment,
to
review
the
judgment
below.
however,
as
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
argument
on
the
state
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
like
to
discuss
it
briefly.
the
suits
in
question
here
were
filed
in
june
1959
in
the
district
court
for
the
state
of
alaska
which
is
the
--
was
the
holdover
territorial
court
committed
to
continue
to
exist
as
long
--
until
the
state
of
alaska
set
up
its
own
judicial
machinery.
the
judgment
was
entered
on
july
2nd,
1959.
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
in
this
court
on
august
6.
there's
no
question
for
that
on
these
dates.
the
district
court
for
the
state
of
alaska
was
the
only
court
operating
in
alaska
and
was
therefore,
the
highest
court.
the
alaska
supreme
court
was
constituted
later.
its
first
members
were
appointed,
first
two
members
who
are
appointed
on
august
7th,
the
third
member
on
september
1st,
rules
were
promulgated
on
september
25th
and
the
effective
date
of
the
rules
was
october
5th.
the
point
here
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
was
not
constituted
as
a
court,
did
not
start
functioning
until
october
the
5th.
judgment
was
entered
on
july
2nd.
the
notice
of
appeal
filed
on
august
6th.
we
submit
--
and
this
is
as
--
as
i've
indicated
something
on
which
all
parties
and
the
solicitor
general
concur
that
under
section
1257
of
the
judicial
code.
the
very
wording
would
indicate
that
july
2nd
should
be
the
date
as
of
which
one
would
determine
whether
we
have
here
a
final
judgment
rendered
by
the
highest
court
in
which
the
decision
could
be
held.
and
on
july
2nd,
the
district
court
for
the
state
of
alaska
was
the
highest
court.
mr.
richard
schifter
the
supreme
court
of
alaska?
mr.
richard
schifter
it
would.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
should
say
we
didn't
want
to
take
any
chances
and
the
prognosis
of
appeal
just
for
the
sake
of
preserving
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
we
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe,
mr.
justice
harlan
meant
the
supreme
court
of
alaska?
mr.
richard
schifter
the
supreme
court
of
alaska.
for
the
supreme
court,
as
i've
indicated,
was
constituted
in
october.
and
to
--
to
be
absolutely
certain
in
protecting
the
rights
of
our
clients,
although
we
did
not
think
that
that
supreme
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
we
did
file
notices
of
appeal.
mr.
richard
schifter
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
no.
mr.
richard
schifter
oh
--
mr.
richard
schifter
no.
i'd
like
to
make
that
clear.
we
believe
that
jurisdiction
vested
in
this
court
and
not
in
the
supreme
court
of
alaska,
but
we
just
wanted
to
be
certain
to
cover
our
--
our
clients
in
all
possibilities.
mr.
richard
schifter
the
wording
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
is
--
mr.
richard
schifter
--
that
final
judgment
rendered
by
the
highest
courts
in
which
--
which
a
decision
could
be
held
are
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
mr.
richard
schifter
there
was
no
supreme
court
of
alaska
at
the
time.
mr.
richard
schifter
on
july
2nd,
when
the
judgment
was
rendered.
mr.
richard
schifter
the
supreme
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
created
afterwards
after
its
--
mr.
richard
schifter
we
are
not
barred,
except
if
this
court,
if
a
jurisdiction
has
vested
in
this
court.
and
it
would
--
i
believe,
being
congress,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
for
a
jurisdiction
to
have
vested
in
this
court
and
then
that
jurisdiction
to
be
defeated
by
the
subsequent
creation
of
a
state
court.
mr.
richard
schifter
but
this
--
may
i
please,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
would
raise
--
i
--
i
believe
two
questions
would
be
--
be
raised
by
your
approach.
one
is
the
actual
--
mr.
richard
schifter
well,
the
wording
of
section
1257
in
the
first
instance
speaks
of
final
judgments
rendered
by
the
highest
court,
being
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
looking
at
the
language
of
1257,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
judgment
rendered
by
a
highest
court.
this
was
a
judgment
rendered
by
a
highest
court,
because
in
july
2nd
when
judge
kelly
in
the
district
court
of
alaska,
rendered
the
judgment.
he
did
constitute
the
highest
court,
so
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
the
judgment
of
the
highest
court
under
the
language
of
1257,
which
under
the
statute,
under
which
this
court
operates
does
vest
jurisdiction
in
the
court.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
mr.
justice
brennan
shortened
the
time.
mr.
richard
schifter
90
days.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
think
it
would,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
--
mr.
richard
schifter
no,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
established
in
october
5th.
a
quick
count
gives
me
--
mr.
richard
schifter
--
october
2nd.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
also
want
to
submit
the
policy
question.
we
filed
our
notice
of
appeal
on
august
6th
and
it
was
then
that
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
vested
and
a
subsequent
creation
of
this
--
of
subsequent
creation
of
a
higher
court
could
actually
then
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
once
it
had
vested.
mr.
richard
schifter
this
complication
was
raised
in
only
one
instance
in
which
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
decided
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
appeals
from
this
district
court
for
the
state
of
alaska
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
was
a
state
court
and
not
a
federal
court.
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
schifter
the
act
of
admission
suggested
that
the
ninth
--
that
the
route
--
the
proper
route
would
be
that
through
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
--
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
this
completes
my
discussion
of
the
common
issues
in
326
and
327,
and
i
would
like
to
proceed
with
the
specific
problem
in
docket
326.
the
metlakatla
indian
community
derives
its
rights
from
a
reservation
granted
by
congress,
by
a
statute
in
1891.
it
was
a
reservation
granted
to
them
to
hold
and
use
the
annette
islands
in
alaska,
subject
to
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
in
the
alaska
pacific
fisheries
case,
this
court
has
defined
the
reservation
as
including
the
adjacent
waters,
the
waters
adjacent
to
the
annette
islands.
and
at
that
time
in
--
in
the
united
pacific
fisheries
case,
enjoined
a
private
company
from
trying
to
fish
in
what
congress
had
set
aside
for
them
as
an
exclusive
fishery.
the
fishery
--
the
reservation
was
further
defined
by
presidential
proclamation
in
1916
to
extend
3000
feet
from
the
shoreline
into
the
sea.
to
--
and
this,
under
the
presidential
proclamation,
constitutes
the
exclusive
fishery.
if
there
ever
was
any
question
as
to
whether
this
presidential
proclamation
was
authorized,
it
was
put
to
rest
by
congress
in
1934,
when
congress
passed
the
statute
which
specifically
ratified
the
presidential
proclamation
of
1916
and
thereby,
clearly
fixed
the
definition
of
the
reservation
to
extend
3000
feet
from
the
shore.
as
i've
indicated
before,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
authorized
metlakatla
to
maintain
fish
traps
within
this
area
reserved
by
congress
and
these
regulations
were
not
questioned
until
statehood.
the
query
that
this
raises
now
is
when
the
statehood,
in
itself,
swept
away
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
1891,
the
proclamation
of
1916
an
the
act
of
1934,
all
of
which
specifically
authorized
the
metlakatla
to
use
these
reservations
subject
to
regulation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
only.
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
do.
i
don't
know
what
you
--
how
you
would
want
to
define
the
reservation
now.
if
you
mean
whether
it
vests
compensable
rights
to
--
is
that
your
question?
mr.
richard
schifter
well,
the
land
itself.
that
includes
the
land
too.
mr.
richard
schifter
the
islands,
and
the
annette
islands
maybe
used
if
to
the
language
of
the
1891
statute
is
that
these
islands
maybe
held
and
used
by
the
indians.
now,
the
law
also
says
until
otherwise
provided
and
that
congress
otherwise
provides,
then
i
presume
this
use
--
is
no
longer
authorized.
mr.
richard
schifter
they
are.
mr.
richard
schifter
indians.
mr.
richard
schifter
it's
tsimshian
indians.
it
is
our
position
that
the
1891
statute,
having
reserved
this
land
until
otherwise
provided
by
law,
would
have
remained
in
effect
until
a
specific
or
--
or
must
remain
in
effect
until
there
is
a
specific
repeal
of
the
1891
reservation.
no
repeal
legislation
has
ever
been
enacted.
on
the
contrary,
the
alaska
statehood
act
specifically,
in
section
4
of
that
act,
preserves
all
the
rights
that
metlakatla
has
under
this
1891
reservation,
including
its
fishing
rights.
under
the
section
4,
under
the
specific
terms
of
section
4,
the
state
of
alaska
disclaimed
any
right
to
interfere
with
the
exercise
by
the
indians
of
any
jurisdiction
--
of
--
of
their
right
here
and
--
and
this
is
the
language
of
section
4,
reserved
these
rights
to
the
“absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
congress.”
section
4
is
therefore
quite
clear
on
this
particular
subject
that
the
rights
of
the
indians
to
use
these
lands,
subject
only
to
regulations
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
is
continued
beyond
statehood.
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
chief
justice,
they
originated
in
british
columbia,
canada.
they
--
they
were
a
rather
well-known
community
in
british
columbia
and
were
invited
by
the
united
states
to
come
to
alaska
in
1887.
there
was
a
religious
division
in
a
--
in
the
particular
group
and
the
minister
and
reverend
duncan,
who
in
great
fame
in
this
particular
area,
moved
out
with
his
congregation
and
established
on
invitation,
from
the
united
states
government
this
new
community
on
the
annette
islands,
the
indians
--
and
this
is
discussed
by
mr.
justice
van
devanter,
in
the
alaska
pacific
fisheries
case.
they
were
given
permission
to
look
around
in
alaska
for
a
particular
location
where
they
would
like
to
settle.
they
picked
the
annette
islands
and
then
they
made
a
request
to
have
this
land
set
aside
for
them.
there
was
then
a
question
as
to
whether
the
president
could
do
it
without
going
to
congress
and
the
attorney
general
ruled
that
it
could
not
and
was
there
found
that
--
that
the
congress
passed
the
statute
of
1891
specifically
setting
this
land
and
the
fishery
aside
for
the
metlakatla
indians.
mr.
richard

they
are
in

in

mr.
richard

alaska
and
--
and
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe
a
little
over
1000.
mr.
richard
schifter
as
far
as
metlakatla
is
concerned,
i
think
a
little
over
1000.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
--
i
could
check
that
in
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
mr.
richard
schifter
the
state,
may
it
please
the
court,
has
not
really
had
any
answer
to
section
4
except
to
say
number
one,
that
it
may
constitute
surplusage.
and
--
and
second,
that
it
maybe
--
or
it
is
unconstitutional
and
to
the
extent
to
which
it
is
possible
to
determine
what
was
meant
below,
it
seems
that
the
--
that
the
decision
below
also
is
that
section
4
is
unconstitutional.
i
should
say
that
section
4
is
not
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
at
all.
mr.
richard

i
would
like
to
--
mr.

mr.

the

suggests
that
this
section

is
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
--
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
yes.
the
--
alaska
came
in
under
the
so-called
tennessee
plan
and
the
constitution
was
adopted
first
and
everything
was
set
up
to
operate
and
then
the
congress
adopted
the
alaska
statehood
act.
mr.
richard

the
admission.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
is
the
counterpart.
that's
right
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
they
are
counterparts.
and
this
is
typical
in
many
of
these
statehood
acts
where
indian
protection
clause
was
written
in.
the
state
was
required.
and
--
and
this
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
come
that,
section
4
is
nothing
new.
it
has
been
in
--
as
indian
protection
clauses
in
state
constitutions
since
1889
and
--
mr.
richard
schifter
there
are
two
grounds
asserted.
one
of
them
is
the
equal
footing
(inaudible)
and
the
other
one
is
the
suggestion
that
the
metlakatla
community
may
not
be
an
indian
tribe.
mr.
richard
schifter
but
--
mr.
richard
schifter
--
it's
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
if
i
may
just
to
cover
the
surplusage
argument
fist,
first
--
it
is
first
contrary
to
the
canons
of
statutory
construction
that
a
--
a
section
such
as
this,
which
had
been
considered
by
congress
for
11
years
and
which
is
in
no
way
new,
but
has
appeared
in
similar
form
as
indian
protection
clauses
and
state
constitution
since
1889,
which
was
the
admission
act
for
the
dakota,
wyoming
and
montana,
that
this
could
possibly
be
surplusage.
we
have
set
forth
in
the
brief,
the
discussion
in
the
committee
reports
of
section
4,
again
over
11
years.
section
4
was
in
there
because
there
were
indian
raised
--
the
questions
raised
by
indians
about
alaska
statehood
and
this
was
specifically
designed
to
--
to
attempt
to
remove
indian
opposition
to
statehood.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
my
understanding
of
the
state's
argument.
i'm
sure
mr.
rader
will
be
able
to
explain
that.
i
understood
from
the
brief
that
they
suggest
that
this
was
surplusage.
it's
cited
in
there
–
it's
stated
in
there
in
brief,
the
last
page.

when
he
goes
fishing
because
of
his
race
as
applied
to

this
provision
is
either
surplusage
or
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
schifter
with
regard
--
mr.
richard
schifter
there
--
mr.
richard
schifter
just
--
there
are
some,
none
quite
like
metlakatla.
there
are
others
that
were
reserved
under
the
amendments
to
wheeler-howard
act.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
that's
right,
it
would.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
does
not
--
they
are
not.
alaska
law
was
committed
to
come
in
under
a
1957
or
1958
amendment
to
what
is
known
as
public
law
--
against
1957,
amendment
to
public
law
280,
of
the
83rd
congress.
in
1953,
congress
passed
the
statute
under
which
certain
state
jurisdiction
was
extended
over
reservations
in
certain
name
of
states.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
was
--
it
was
state
jurisdiction
in
1953
covering
california.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
beg
your
pardon?
it
was
a
general
--
there
was
a
--
mr.
richard
schifter
there
was
a
--
mr.
richard
schifter
there
was
a
general
statute
passed
in
1953,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
covering
california,
minnesota
--
well,
by
five
states
in
the
united
states.
in
1957,
this
law
was
amended
to
add
the
territory
of
alaska
to
provide
that
state
law
and
order
and
civil
jurisdiction
or
--
or
territorial
line
or
the
--
and
--
and
civil
jurisdiction
were
extended
over
the
indian
country,
except
that
that
law
too,
specifically
provides
that
when
it
comes
to
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
that
state
law
shall
not
extend
to
that
or
territorial
law?
mr.
richard
schifter
the
--
without
making
any
specific
provision,
the
statehood
act
would
necessarily
require
that
--
that
the
state
can
exercise
whatever
authority
the
territory
could,
in
matters
other
than
fishing
and
hunting
rights,
so
there's
--
it
assumes
the
same
position
the
territory
of
alaska
had
under
this
amendment
to
what
is
known
as
public
law
280
of
the
83rd
congress.
but
this
does
not
extend
to
fishing
and
hunting
rights
and
is
specifically
exempted
by
that
1953
law
as
amended
and
was
again
exempted
by
section
4
of
the
statehood
act.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
would
say
the
answer
is
no.
the
--
mr.
richard
schifter
section
4
says
there's
an
absolute
--
words
of
section
4,
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states.
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
and
that
would
encompass
everything.
i
would
now
like
to
address
myself
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine
argument
raised
by
the
state.
it
is
suggested
that
section
4
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
is
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
citing
the
pollard
case.
we
submit
that
as
was
spelled
out
clearly
by
this
court
in
coyle
versus
smith,
the
meaning
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
that
you
cannot
use
a
statehood
act
to
exact
from
a
state,
a
surrender
of
authority
to
the
federal
government
in
an
area
in
which
a
federal
government
would
not
otherwise
have
jurisdiction
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
here,
we
are
not
dealing
with
such
a
situation.
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
in
--
with
a
field
of
activity
in
which
the
federal
government
has
been
involved
under
the
constitution
specifically
under
the
indian
commerce
clause,
ever
since
the
united
states
became
an
independent
--
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
my
last
point.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
and
we
attempt
to
answer
that
in
our
reply
brief.
assuming
for
the
moment
that
these
are
tribal
indians,
there
is
no
question
that
the
indian
commerce
clause
permits
the
united
states
to
--
to
legislate
in
this
area
and
that
it
was
therefore,
under
the
indian
commerce
clause
that
the
united
states
was
able
to
place
section
4
in
the
alaska
statehood
act,
as
it
did
with
regard
to
similar
sections
in
previous
statehood
acts.
congress
has
plenary
authority
over
indian
affairs
as
was
held
by
this
court
in
lone
wolf
versus
hitchcock.
therefore,
the
equal
footing
doctrine
could
not
possibly
have
anything
to
do
with
this
particular
area
of
federal
intervention.
this
makes
me
come
to
the
last
question
just
raised
by
mr.
justice
harlan
namely
whether
the
metlakatla
indian
community
is
an
indian
tribe
and
whether
possibly,
the
federal
government
is
not
permitted
to
enter
into
this
area
because
this
should
not
be
constitute
--
not
be
denominated
an
indian
tribe.
the
answer
to
this
is
that
it
has
been
the
repeatedly
stated
doctrine
of
this
court
that
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
community
is
an
indian
tribe
or
not
is
one
for
the
executive
and
for
congress
and
not
for
the
judiciary.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
does
not.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
speaks
of
natives
and
--
mr.
richard
schifter
--
indians,
eskimos
et
cetera.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
would
say
--
just
say
this
that
perhaps
this
question
could
be
raised,
the
question
of
unconstitutionality
of
section
4
in
this
regard
with
regard
with
to
some
other
community,
i
don't
know.
but
with
regard
to
this
community,
there's
no
doubt
that
it
has
always
been
recognized
as
an
indian
tribe
and
that
this
recognition
would
be
binding
on
--
mr.
richard
schifter
canada.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
mr.
richard
schifter
we
have
cited
the
constitution
of
the
--
of
the
tribe.
the
--
they
have
been
recognized
by
the
--
by
the
statutes
itself.
and
that
under
the
definition
of
--
the
definition
of
a
--
an
indian
tribe
as
stated
in
the
--
in
cohen's
handbook
of
indian
affairs,
one
of
possible
criteria
would
be
that
congress
has
recognized
them
as
--
as
an
indian
group
and
has
given
them
some
common
property
of
rights.
the
act
of
1891
does
just
that.
the
presidential
proclamation
of
1916
again
does
just
that
and
the
act
of
1934
does
that.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
your
honor.
they
do
have
a
constitution
under
the
wheeler-howard
act,
as
amended
and
they
have
a
charter
under
the
wheeler-howard
act,
as
amended.
they're
--
prior
to
the
time
that
they
had
a
constitution
which
was
only
adopted
in
1944,
they
had
a
tribal
council
or
a
community
council
under
federal
regulations,
25
cfr,
pt.1
in
--
for
many
years
constituted
of
just
that
regulations
for
the
operation
of
the
metlakatla
community
including
their
tribal
or
community
government.
it
was
superseded
in
1944
by
a
constitution
under
the
wheeler-howard
act
as
amended
to
--
to
include
alaska.
throughout
all
its
dealings
with
the
metlakatla
indian
community,
the
united
states
has,
at
all
times
it
is,
the
congress
and
the
department
of
the
interior
have
recognized
metlakatla
as
an
indian
community.
they've
called
it
a
community.
it's
in
the
--
under
the
definitions
here,
the
equivalent
of
a
tribe
and
it's
quite
clear
that
therefore,
we
are
dealing
with
the
exercise
of
an
authority
which
is
subject
only
to
--
which
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
believe
that
other
than
tsimshian
indians
have
been
admitted
to
membership,
that
is
some
tlingit
and
haida
indians,
that
you
have
this
all
over
the
rest
of
the
united
states
where
there's
a
great
deal
of
intermarriage
taking
place
and
the
spouses
of
--
let's
say
blackfeet
indians
admitted
to
the
blackfoot
tribe,
if
they
belong
to
laguna.
this
is
--
i
happen
to
note
this
particular
situation.
through
intermarriage,
you
get
all
kinds
of
other
indians
admitted
into
other
tribes
for
not
--
of
non-indians.
let
me
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
schifter
