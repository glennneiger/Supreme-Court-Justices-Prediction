justice
john
m.
harlan
what
if
they
didn't
know
what
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
your
condition
on
discrimination
is
accepted
(inaudible),
and
the
state
get
to
assume
that
there
is
a
discrimination,
is
that
all
you've
to
prove
in
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
statute
on
discrimination.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
open
in
your
view
for
the
state
to
show
discrimination
based
on
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that
factor,
that
wasn't
done.
justice
john
m.
harlan
currently,
i
want
to
clear
this
part
you
say,
this
part
of
the
case.
you
pointed
two
discriminations.
number
one
is
the
(inaudible)
less
than
three
years,
in
which
case
a
lessee
of
the
state
pays
no
tax,
whereas
the
federal
lessee
does
fell
into
the
tax.
justice
john
m.
harlan
secondly
that's
--
apart
from
that
assuming
that
that
discrimination
has
pronounced
a
condition
themselves,
where
the
state
lessee
gets
taxed
only
the
leasehold
value,
whereas
the
federal
lessee
gets
taxed
on
the
full
value
of
the
feel,
correct?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
a
dispute
being
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that's
an
unconstitutional
discrimination,
and
now
a
dispute
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
point
is
bad
under
allegheny.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
this
one.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
and
here
in
texas
statute
it
seems
to
be
an
ad
valorem
tax.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
recollection
is
they
did
that
in
michigan
too
which
didn't
impress
the
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
listed
the
land
that
--
on
its
tax
rolls
the
way
you
said
with
--
with
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
phillips
doesn't
pay
the
tax,
what
remedy
is
--
and
texas
got
to
collect
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
lien
against
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
the
cases
that
they
cite?
i
assume
they're
texas
cases.
do
they
hold
such
a
situation,
a
lien
runs
only
against
the
leasehold?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh
it's
the
next
sentence
end
of
the
paragraph
says
it.
this
proposition
was
expressly
decided
in
sra
against
minnesota.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
if
there's
no
dispute
at
all
addressed
to
this
argument
that
if
phillips
was
the
lessee
of
this
same
plant
from
the
state,
it
would
not
be
subject
to
tax?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
dispute
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
i'd
like
to
sharpen
up
my
question
for
you
then
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
had
a
dozen
other
phillips
around
texas
who
leased
from
the
state
exactly
comparable
plants,
they
would
not
be
taxed.
phillips
leasing
from
the
federal
government
would
be
taxed,
but
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
the
basis
of
the
classification
that
you
would
rely
on
is
justifying
that
difference
in
tax
treatment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
a
sufficient
basis.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
what
you're
really
saying
here
is
not
that
there
is
not
a
classification
but
that
the
discrimination
does
not
in
fact
exist
because
texas
does
not
have
properties
of
this
kind
to
lease
to
other
people.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
tomorrow
texas
could
go
into
the
business
if
leasing
a
plant
of
this
kind
if
it
chose
to
put
up
a
state
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
one
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
thought
you
tell
me
a
few
moments
ago,
i
misunderstood
you
that
if
you
did
have
some
other
phillips
around
using
other
plants
in
texas.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
then
you
would
agree
--
that
there
was
no
proper
classification.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
said
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
well,
the
chief
justice
has
now
pointed
out
one
that
does
exist.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
to
the
state's
argument
that
the
decisions
of
last
year
about
little
breath
of
light
now
again?
