mr.
earnest
l.
langley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
before
i
begin
my
argument,
i
want
to
move
the
admission
pro
hac
vice
for
the
purpose
of
arguing
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
texas,
mr.
jack
n.
price
of
austin,
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
is
quite
obvious
from
the
argument
that
has
gone
before
that
the
principal
question
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
discrimination.
i
will
proceed
immediately
to
attack
that
question
in,
your
honor.
but
first,
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
court
has
been
subjected
thus
far
to
this
sort
of
a
thing.
counsel
for
appellant
and
for
the
united
states
have
placed
upon
appellant
a
label
as
federal
lessee
and
has
attempted
to
place
upon
all
others
using
and
occupying
exempt
property
for
profit,
a
lessee
--
a
label
as
lessee
of
other
exempt
property,
and
has
attempted
to
say
that
before
a
tax
can
avoid
the
label
of
discrimination
that
it
must
be
a
tax
which
bears
equally
upon
all
lessees.
we
submit
that
this
label
is
not
necessarily
adequate
that
it,
in
itself,
constitutes
a
form
of
discrimination
because
there
are
other
users
and
occupiers
with
the
exempt
property
than
lessees,
and
there
are
situations
where
the
label
of
lessees
of
federal
property
and
other
lessees
is
inadequate
from
a
real
and
practical
standpoint
because
another
label
may
well
be
applied
to
appellant
here
and
that
is
the
label
of
one
who
uses
and
occupies
for
profit
and
for
its
own
benefit,
property
which
is
exempt
from
taxation.
they
have
also
used
the
label
of
discrimination
in
every
instance
to
speak
of
distinction
and
tax
treatment
which
is
not
necessarily
the
same.
we
propose
to
attack
this
argument
in
two
ways,
first,
by
pointing
out
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
last
year
in
the
borg-warner
case
and
in
a
--
to
a
lesser
degree
in
the
continental
motors
and
murray
cases
decided
on
the
same
day.
that
the
situation
in
texas
as
presented
by
our
statute
when
construed
in
context
with
other
taxing
statutes
of
the
state
is
essentially
identical
to
the
situation
presented
in
michigan
and
the
borg-warner
case
in
which
i
have
received
the
approval
of
this
court.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
i
intend
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
your
honor.
first
in,
i
would
like
to
read
the
michigan
statute.
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
not
having
this
printed
in
a
form
where
it
can
be
followed
verbatim,
but
in
the
brief
for
appellee
it
is
substantially
set
forth
at
page
28
at
the
first
paragraph,
which
i
must
not
rely
upon,
but
will
read
the
statute
itself
to
show
that,
in
fact,
the
michigan
statute
is
not
a
statute
which
pertains
to
all
lessees
of
exempt
property.
the
statute
has,
as
it
will
be
demonstrated,
three
broad
exemptions
from
its
operations.
the
act,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
margin
of
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
borg-warner
case,
“when
any
real
property
which
for
any
reason
is
exempt
from
taxation
as
leased,
loaned
or
otherwise
made
available
to
and
used
by
private
individual
association
or
corporation
in
connection
with
their
business
conducted
for
profit.”
now,
that
is
essentially
the
requirement
of
the
tax
statute.
that
is
the
use
of
exempt
property
for
profit.
the
texas
statute
purports
to
pertain
only
to
property
of
the
federal
government.
this
purports
to
pertain
to
any
real
property,
any
reason
exempt.
then
the
first
exception
is
found
except,
and
this
is
quoted
verbatim
in
my
brief
at
page
28,
“except
where
the
use
is
by
way
of
a
concession
in
or
relative
to
the
use
of
a
public
airport,
park,
market,
playground
or
a
similar
property,
which
is
available
to
the
use
of
the
general
problem.”
that's
the
first
broad
exception.
then
it
provides
“shall
be
subject
to
taxation
in
the
same
amount
and
to
the
same
extent
as
though
the
lessee
or
the
user
were
the
owner
of
such
property.”
and
then,
by
way
of
proviso,
two
additional
exceptions,
first,
the
only
one
that
was
actually
mentioned
and
adverted
to
by
this
court
in
its
opinions
under
the
michigan
cases
that
“the
foregoing
shall
not
apply
to
federal
property
for
which
payments
are
made
in
lieu
of
taxes
and
amounts
equivalent
to
taxes
which
might
otherwise
be
lawfully
assessed.”
that's
the
second
exception.
the
third
exception,
“or
a
property
of
any
state
supported
educational
institution.”
that
is
the
michigan
statute.
there
are
other
statutes
in
the
state
of
michigan
too
not
mentioned
by
this
court
in
its
opinion
but
mentioned
by
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
in
its
opinion
particularly
in
the
muskegon
case.
that
statute
is
the
one
in
section
7.3
of
the
michigan
statute
annotated
which
provides
that
a
person
in
possession
of
property
maybe
called
upon
to
pay
the
taxes
thereon,
essentially
the
same
as
the
one
used
in
the
murray
case
except
applicable
as
well
to
real
property.
and
then
7.9
(5)
of
the
michigan
statute,
which
provides
that
when
a
tenant
or
other
person
in
possession
of
property
is
called
upon
to
pay
the
tax
thereon,
they're
entitled
to
deduct
the
same
from
the
rent,
unless
otherwise
provided
by
contract
with
their
landlord.
now,
the
argument
was
made
by
continental
motors
in
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
that
these
statutes
meant
that
any
lessee
of
exempt
property
in
michigan
other
than
a
lessee
from
the
federal
government
will
thereby
be
entitled
to
recover
by
these
statutes
from
the
landlord,
and
that
this,
in
itself,
meant
that
the
michigan
statute
was
directed
solely
to
federal
lessees.
that
argument
was
deemed
immaterial
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
view
of
the
overriding
importance
of
the
basis
for
classification
of
property
which
will
be
adverted
to
at
the
second
point
in
this
argument.
now,
then,
that
is
the
michigan
situation
that
has
been
approved
by
this
court
only
last
year.
what
then
is
the
situation
in
texas?
the
texas
statute
itself
which
we
are
discussing
now
purports
to
apply
only
to
federal
property.
but
there
are
three
types
of
exempt
property
generally.
they
may
be
classified
as
such,
property
of
the
federal
government
which
is
not
exempt
actually
but
is
immune,
property
of
state
in
local
subdivisions
of
government
and
property
of
private
owners
where
the
property
is
devoted
to
some
such
public
use
that
it
is
deemed
unworthy
of
exemption
from
taxation,
property
of
church
and
charitable
institutions
and
other
organizations
such
as
that.
now,
in
texas
by
the
clear
reading
of
the
constitution
and
statutes,
all
property
of
exempt
organizations
other
than
governmental
loses
its
exemption
entirely
when
devoted
to
a
private
use
or
when
devoted
to
a
use
for
profit.
therefore,
we
may
eliminate
from
considerations
that
privately
owned
exempt
property
not
because
the
lessee
has
to
pay
taxes
on
it
because,
of
course,
the
lessee
does
not,
but
the
owner
will
pay
taxes
on
it
and
presumably
that
lessee
will
pay
taxes
in
the
guise
of
increased
rent
to
a
tax
paying
landlord.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
that
is
true
under
our
constitution
and
statutes.
the
--
every
provision
for
exemptions
specifically
limits
the
use
to
which
it
maybe
made.
the
cases
decided
and
the
constitution
and
statutes
are
clear
in
that
regard.
there
are
no
exceptions
to
that
so
far
as
i
know.
that
leaves
us
then
with
the
--
a
state
and
local
government
property
and
the
federal
property.
looking
then
at
what
happens
to
state
and
local
property,
we
find
that
much
of
it
is
also
taxable.
not
all
of
it
and
not
all
that
is
taxable
is
fully
taxable.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
--
under
the
general
wording
of
our
texas
statute
providing
that
all
taxes
are
a
pertinent
obligation
of
the
owner,
that
the
church
would
be
liable
for
the
tax
and
that
as
well
the
property
would
be
liable
under
the
lien
sections
of
our
taxing
statutes.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
both.
yes,
your
honor.
much
state
and
local
property
is
also
subject
to
taxation
in
full
or
in
part.
in
the
first
place,
the
exemption
from
taxation
of
state
and
local
property
is
limited
to
state
and
local
property
owned
and
held
for
a
public
purpose.
our
state
cases,
many
of
which
are
cited
in
our
briefs,
hold
that
when
the
public
purpose
is
abandoned
that
the
property
becomes
subject
to
taxation.
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
the
court,
our
courts
have
been
regulable
in
the
interpretation
of
public
purpose.
i
would
not
say
that
this
particular
purpose
in
which
the
dumas
school
district
is
attempting
to
tax
phillips
chemical
company
would
not
be
considered
a
public
purpose.
i'm
sure
that
it
would,
if
this
property
were
owned
by
the
state
of
texas,
it
would
be
a
public
purpose
because
the
rents
would
be
devoted
to
public
purpose.
yet,
nevertheless,
that
is
a
limitation
upon
the
exemption
of
state
and
local
property.
certain
other
property
--
and
by
and
large,
this
property
pertains
to
property
that
is
held
not
for
a
governmental
purpose
but
for
some
ancillary
purpose.
much
of
our
state
property
is
specifically
by
statute
made
subject
to
taxation.
for
example,
our
county
school
lands,
they
are
made
taxable
for
a
certain
purpose,
it's
limited,
of
course.
not
all
taxation
on
county
school
lands,
the
counties
don't
tax
themselves.
the
schools
don't
tax
the
county
school
lands,
but
they
are
subject
to
some
taxation
because
they
are
a
broad
class
of
property
and
are
ordinarily
devoted
to
leasing
to
private
persons.
as
well
the
lands
of
the
university
of
texas
are
subject
to
county
taxation,
because
they
--
again,
they
are
ordinarily
leased.
and
those
two
provisions
were
adopted
by
a
constitutional
amendment
and
enactment
of
statutes
few
years
ago
since
the
1888
cases
in
texas
that
are
relied
upon
so
heavily
by
opposing
counsel
in
this
case.
a
person
from
--
mr.

l.
langley
i
doubt

mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
doubt

mr.

langley
i
don't
think
it

no,
sir.
mr.

a
privately
endowed
college,
it
would
be
subject
to
taxation.
mr.

educational
purposes.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
st.
edwards
college
case
and
edmond
against
morris
and
other
cases
cited
at
least
in
the
lower
courts.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
consider
that
a
pertinent
question
before
this
court
in
our
brief.
i
doubt
if
they're
cited
here.
but
there
are
numerous
cases
in
the
state
of
texas
holding
the
privately
endowed
educational
institution.
there's
one
holding
even
that
the
farm
that
it
raised
the
food
for
the
table
in
the
college
dormitory
was
subject
to
taxation
because
it
was
not
used
for
educational
purposes.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
it
would
be
assessed
against
either
one
at
this
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
it
would
be
assessed
against
the
owner
in
that
particular
case.
the
exemption
would
be
lost
to
the
owner.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
the
exemption
is
wholly
lost
when
privately
owned
tax-exempt
property
is
used
for
private
purposes.
and
private
purposes
do
not
necessarily
mean
leased
purposes.
of
the
case
i've
just
mentioned,
the
college
case,
quite
old
case
incidentally,
where
the
college
used
a
farm
to
grow
food
for
the
college
dormitory
tables.
it
was
subject
to
taxation,
because
not
used
for
purposes.
further,
property
used
as
resident
for
the
teachers
at
the
school
is
educational
property
and
does
not
have
the
exemption.
the
exemption
is
wholly
lost.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
believe
not,
your
honor,
because
it
would
not
be
a
tax
on
the
leaseholder.
it
would
be
a
loss
of
exemption
actually
and
the
owner
of
the
property
would
be
subject
to
the
taxation.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
if
the
state
owned
the
property,
i
--
i
assume
that
it
would
be
applicable
because
the
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
if
it's
over
three
years,
lease
from
--
of
the
state
property
would
be
subject
to
taxation.
certain
other
classes
of
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
that
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
article
7174
says
the
value
of
the
leasehold
is
fair
market
value,
fair
price
for
cash.
however,
i
reserve
my
own
opinion,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
1888
cases
actually
anymore
have
any
validity
and
whether
or
not
the
article
--
provisions
of
7174
overrule
the
more
explicit
provisions
of
7173
that
shall
be
considered
for
all
the
purposes
of
taxation
as
a
property
of
the
lessee,
and
therefore,
presumably
subject
to
taxation
at
its
full
value.
reagan
county
against
big
lake
oil
company
or
big
lake
oil
company
against
reagan
county,
it
was
an
error
refused
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
assumed
that.
i
think
it
perhaps
maybe
assumed
from
the
opinions
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
this
case,
that
there
is
more
validity
to
article
7173
than
was
formally
accorded
to
it
under
the
old
1888
and
1889
cases.
but
that,
of
course,
is
not
before
this
court
and
perhaps
may
not
be
before
any
court
for
sometime
but
if
it
is,
i
think
the
opinion
of
our
supreme
court
in
this
case
will
have
some
bearing
on
that.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
adverted
to
that
yesterday
mentioning
that
he
thought
trammell
against
faught
might
well
have
overruled
by
this
case.
the
actual
valuation,
however,
is
a
matter
that
i
consider
still
open
in
texas.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
it
would
be
subject
to
taxation
under
the
leasehold
in
my
opinion.
we
feel
that
the
holding
of
--
so-called
holding
of
daugherty
against
thompson,
trammell
against
faught
that
the
lease
is
not
a
lease
for
a
term
of
three
years
or
more
because
subject
to
cancellation
upon
condition
has
been
overruled
not
only
by
the
supreme
court
of
this
case
but
by
five
other
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
state
court
opinion
but
which
we
deem
not
pertinent
here,
and
not
cited,
but
i
have
citations,
five
later
cases
than
these
1888
cases
in
texas
have
held
that
a
lease
is
nevertheless
a
lease
for
a
term
of
year.
the
dissenters
in
this
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
our
citation
of
those
cases
but
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
that's
true.
then
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
in
addition
to
the
taxation
of
county
school,
university
lands,
prison
lands
and
other
types
of
lands
in
texas,
we
have,
of
course,
the
taxation
of
the
leasehold
under
article
7173
and
7174,
which
probably
has,
as
we
have
indicated,
more
validity
than
counsel
for
a
felony
that
has
given
to
it.
all
of
these
are
properties
which
are
limited
in
scope
perhaps
but
nevertheless
reflect
that
in
proper
circumstances,
the
state
of
texas
has
not
hesitated
to
subject
its
own
state
and
local
property
to
some
taxation
if
not
all.
and
the
property
that
is
not
taxable
at
all
or
is
limited
in
taxation
is
a
property
that,
in
our
opinion,
is
very
limited
in
scope
and
is
no
more
broad
than
the
exceptions
from
the
operation
of
the
michigan
statute
which
we
have
read
to
the
court.
in
the
first
place,
texas
has
no
industrial
or
commercial
property.
the
property
that
is
of
that
kind
or
is
devoted
to
commercial
or
industrial
use
is
limited
in
scope
within
the
purview
of
the
first
exception
in
the
michigan
statute
that
is
property
devoted
to
concession
in
or
relative
to
the
use
of
public
airports,
parks,
playgrounds
and
other
things,
as
we
will
demonstrate.
most
of
the
property
owned
by
the
state
of
texas
itself
is
school
property.
in
1898,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
held
that
all
the
remaining
public
domain
of
the
state
of
texas
belonged
to
the
school
fund.
hogue
against
baker
decided
in
that
year.
there
is
no
public
domain
in
texas
except
school
land.
the
--
the
school
land,
of
course,
would
be
exempt
under
the
michigan
statute.
property
of
state-supported
educational
institutions
is
exempt
under
that
statute
as
it
would
be
exempt
in
texas.
the
lease
property,
that
is
concession
type
property,
is
demonstrated
very
vividly
by
what
appellant
has
attempted
to
do
in
this
particular
case.
the
appellant
has
brought
no
evidence
in
the
trial
court
in
this
case,
as
the
record
reflects.
there
is
no
evidence
of
discrimination.
there
is
no
evidence
of
--
of
unjust
distinction
for
tax
treatment.
there
just
wasn't
any
evidence
on
the
point
brought.
they
have,
therefore,
arranged
far
field
and
outside
the
record
and
have
attempted
to
show
in
the
abstract
from
the
application
of
every
statute
that
they
could
find
and
every
indication
that
they
could
find
in
the
texas
law
that
texas
property
is
subject
to
--
is
not
subject
to
taxation
but
it
is
exempt.
they
have,
for
example,
at
page
29
of
their
brief,
as
appellant
in
this
case,
“although
texas
and
its
political
subdivisions
may
not
hold
industrial
plants
reserved
for
national
defense,
the
state
and
its
agencies
do
own
and
lease
properties
of
even
greater
value.
to
cite
the
most
outstanding
example
of
such
properties,
as
is
generally
known,
the
extremely
rich
and
prolific
oil
and
gas
lands
of
texas
and
its
subdivisions
are
periodically
leased
for
millions
of
dollars
to
private
corporations.”
that
is
the
only
example
cited
in
the
first
brief
and
this
court
well
knows
that
a
lease
of
oil
and
gas
lands
in
texas
is
not
a
lease
at
all.
it's
a
conveyance
of
an
interest
in
the
minerals
and
fee,
a
determinable
fee
in
the
minerals.
this
court
also
knows
it
held
so
in
group
no.
1
oil
company
against
bass
a
number
of
years
ago
that
the
interest
of
the
lessee
in
those
all
in
gas
leases
is
fully
taxable
at
the
full
value
of
the
mineral
interest
granted,
it's
not
even
a
lease.
well,
we
complain
that
that
was
an
improper
example
in
our
brief
and
therefore,
in
the
reply
brief,
they
have
gone
to
the
statute
books
and
have
come
up
presumably
with
everything
they
can
find.
it's
at
page
7
of
the
brief
--
of
reply
brief
of
appellant
filed
on
last
saturday.
they
give
examples
--
of
a
number
of
texas
statutes
and
i'm
not
--
yes.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
7,
your
honor,
of
the
reply
brief.
not
examples
of
evidence
showing
that,
in
fact,
there
is
discrimination
or
that
there
is
taxation,
but
rather
examples
of
texas
statutes
authorizing
leasing
of
government
property
which
they
would
say
is
exempt
from
taxation
and
therefore
reflects
discrimination
against
the
federal
government.
let's
examine
those.
the
first
two
are
essentially
the
same.
their
provisions
are
very
similar.
one
said
airports
and
airport
facilities,
the
other
said
airport
property
including
such
lands
and
improvements
necessary
to
assemble
or
manufacture
military
and
naval
aircraft.
on
yesterday,
mr.
davis
stated
that
the
state
of
texas
is
authorized
to
lease
to
private
persons
for
the
purpose
of
manufacturing
military
and
naval
aircraft
lands
of
the
state
airports.
your
honors,
it's
quite
obvious
that
mr.
davis
has
not
read
that
statute.
that
statute
provides
that
lands
and
improvements
necessary
to
assemble
or
manufacturer
military
and
naval
aircraft
can
be
leased
only
to
the
united
states.
that
is
a
restriction
contained
in
that
statute.
it
is
true
that
other
airport
property
maybe
leased
in
the
way
of
concession
but
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
it
must
not
be
such
a
use
that
will
exclude
the
general
public.
that's
what
the
michigan
statute
says
that
the
exemption
is
where
it
may
be
used
by
way
of
concession
in
or
relative
to
the
use
of
a
public
airport.
it's
identical
to
the
michigan
statute
in
that
regard,
not
found
in
the
same
statute
but
found
in
the
same
statutory
scheme.
that's
the
first
example.
the
next
is
wharf,
docks,
warehouses,
grain
elevators,
bunkering
facilities,
belt
railroads
and
other
harbor
facilities
under
article
8247
(a)
(b)
and
(c).
first
place,
i
might
point
out
that
(c),
that
subdivision
does
pertain
to
leases
again
to
united
states.
but
the
others
--
the
statute
is
restricted
to
what
we
call
navigation
districts
in
texas,
much
lack
perhaps
before
new
york
authority
is
something
else.
again,
a
concession
type
use,
a
use
that
is
so
large
that
perhaps
no
private
industry
had
been
found
that
is
willing
to
operate
it
and
such
harbor
as
the
port
of
houston,
the
port
of
galveston,
corpus
christi,
brownsville
and
perhaps
other.
i
don't
live
on
the
coast
and
don't
know
about
those
things,
but
those
things
are
interstate
organizations,
state
instrumentalities
that
provide
those
public
facilities.
and
these
uses
are
by
way
of
concession
in
or
--
or
use
of
with
--
along
with
the
general
public
these
public
facilities.
that's
all
they
are.
again,
they
would
be
excluded
under
the
michigan
statute.
then
municipal
fish
markets,
including
facilities
for
cleaning,
canning,
and
cold
storage
of
fish.
that
article
is
well
provides
that
in
cities
along
the
coast
where
they
have
fishing
industry,
that
the
city
may
provide
for
a
public
municipal
fish
market
to
be
used
by
the
public
in
general
on
a
concession
type
arrangement
and
operation.
the
state
is
not
authorized
nor
any
subdivision
to
build
fish
markets
and
lease
them
to
people.
the
next
one
is,
i
guess,
the
most
--
well,
it's
the
oddest
one
of
the
bunch
to
be
included
here
your
honors.
islands,
flats
or
submerged
lands,
the
idea
being
given
from
the
brief
that
all
the
islands
and
the
flats
and
the
submerged
lands
of
texas
may
be
leased
under
article
969
(a).
article
969
(a)
is
what
our
friend,
the
attorney
general
here,
says
is
a
unconstitutional
special
legislation
statute.
it
was
enacted
1929
and
provide
as
follows,
that
any
city
which
had
been
given
or
granted
islands,
flats
and
submerged
lands
by
the
republic
of
texas
or
the
state
of
texas,
which
city
had
more
than
43,000
people
and
was
located
in
a
county
with
less
than
100,000
people
according
to
the
last
federal
census
could
lease
those
islands,
flats
and
submerged
lands.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
it
was
apparently
designed
to
answer
some
specific
problem
that
some
city
had,
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
don't
know.
those
things
are
not
set
forth
in
our
statutes,
and
i
don't
know
where
it
was.
some
city
in
1929
that
had
more
than
43,000
people
and
was
located
in
the
county
of
less
than
100,000
people
had
been
given
some
islands,
flats
and
submerged
lands
and
want
to
lease
them
i
suppose.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
so
far
as
we
know,
there
wouldn't
have
been
many
certainly.
probably
one
isolated
instance,
your
honor,
that's
the
reason
that
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
no,
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
i
often
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
--
become
curious
about
those
special
statutes.
and
you
can't
find
out
in
(inaudible),
and
i
don't
know
in
any
other
way
to
know
without
finding
the
legislator.
we
have
a
number
of
those
in
texas
like
that.
there
--
we
call
them
special
statutes
and
we
call
them
bracket
statutes,
it's
something
like
that.
but
that's
all
that
statute
is.
then
the
next
one
is
almost,
as
that,
facilities
on
reconstructed
or
reclaimed
land,
article
1187
(a).
1187
(a)
provides
that
cities
located
on
deepwater
ports
and
within
a
navigation
district
that
have
inlets
and
canals
coming
into
the
port
can
build
bridges
over
those
inlets
and
canals.
and
for
that
purpose
are
authorized
to
acquire
such
property
they
need
for
the
abundance
and
approaches
to
those
bridges.
and
that
if
that
reconstructed
or
reclaimed
land
that
they
use
for
that
purpose
has
--
has
some
part
of
it
excess
to
its
need,
they
can
lease
that.
that's
what
that
part
has
said.
the
next
one
on
page
8,
parking
garage
and
retail
establishment
in
state
office
building,
article
678
(c).
article
678
(c)
is
the
statutory
authority
for
the
construction
of
our
new
state
office
building
in
austin,
which
we're
quite
proud
of.
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
constructed
as
a
part
of
the
building
a
garage
for
the
cars
of
the
employees
and
people
in
that
building
and
that
they
shall
provide
on
the
ground
floor
a
barber
shop
and
a
café
and
a
drugstore
and
that
those
things
maybe
leased
out,
and
that's
what
that
article
provides
for.
housing
authority
properties
again
authorizes
the
cities
of
the
state
to
organize
within
themselves
municipal
housing
authorities
for
the
purpose
of
slum
clearance
and
low
cost
housing
and
to
lease
their
facilities
to
the
individual
rents.
that's
what
that
article
provides
for.
now,
i
don't
know
what
the
article
covers
that's
cited
next
article
666
(a),
because
i
don't
know
and
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
to
show
how
much
there
is
of
property
classified
as
public
grounds
belong
to
the
state
of
texas
under
the
charge
and
control
of
the
state
boarder
control.
presumably,
that's
the
catchall
for
property
in
texas.
that's
what
my
friend
the
attorney
general
tells
me.
it's
a
property
that
somebody
else
doesn't
have
the
boarder
control
watches
after
it
until
they
need
it
or
something.
i
don't
know
what
that
covers.
it
may
be
that
there
maybe
some
substantial
property
there,
but
presumably,
it
would
be
excess
to
the
immediate
needs,
temporarily
unused
and
unneeded
property
of
the
state,
and
certainly
nothing
in
the
way
of
industrial
or
commercial
property
of
the
type
that
we
have
in
this
case.
the
next
one,
any
unsold
land
in
the
public
domain.
again,
as
we
have
said,
the
public
domain
includes
the
school
lands
of
the
state
of
texas.
this
provides
that
while
such
lands
are
waiting
sale,
they
may
be
leased.
there
maybe
substantial
amount
of
that.
i
don't
know
how
much
there
is
of
it
but
whatever
there
is,
it's
owned
by
the
public
state-supported
educational
institutions,
which
are
exempted
under
the
michigan
statute
as
well
as
in
texas.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
they
are
grave
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
we
have
some
of
them
now
in
our
way,
yes,
sir.
and
much
of
them
--
most
of
them
are
in
west
texas.
they're
grazing
lands
primarily,
not
suitable
for
anything
other
than
grazing
land
or
(inaudible)
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
leased
in
large
tracks,
most
the
time
for
something
in
neighborhood
for
five
cents
an
acre
a
year.
then
the
next
one
is
property
years
for
pumping
stations,
loading
racks,
electric
substations
and
tank
farms.
now,
that
again
would
seem
to
put
the
state
of
texas
in
the
business
of
building,
operating
and
leasing,
pumping
stations,
loading
racks
and
so
forth.
actually
what
that
statute
is,
article
6028
is
a
statute
that
provides
that
where
the
state
has
leased
its
lands
for
oil
and
gas,
and
the
oil
and
gas
lessee
needs
to
use
some
of
the
surface
on
an
easement
basis
for
building
its
pumping
station
and
its
loading
racks
and
its
substations
and
so
forth
that
the
state
can
allow
to
use
that
in
connection
with
its
oil
and
gas
operation.
and
that's
all
that
statute
shows.
the
next
one
is
property
owned
or
controlled
by
any
state
agency
where
not
otherwise
prohibited.
now,
that
article,
article
2922
(zz)
(1)
is
a
part
of
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
texas
on
public
education.
it
is
a
school
statute,
and
it
provides
in
general
that
where
any
state
agency
has
a
property
in
a
school
district
and
where
the
owning
of
that
property
by
the
state
call
this
a
financial
hardship
on
the
school
district,
that
that
state
agency
is
authorized
to
make
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
to
the
school
district.
that's
what
that
statute
actually
provides
and
provides
in
instance
at
some
rented
property,
maybe
leased
or
--
for
years
by
the
state
agency
or
whatever
it
is,
but
it's
--
it's
not
--
the
statute
authorize
to
enact
it
to
authorize
the
state
to
lease
property.
it's
a
payment
in
lieu
of
taxes
sort
of
a
statute.
now,
those
are
the
examples
that
are
given
from
the
statute.
in
the
reply
brief,
we
also
find
in
the
appendix
three
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
of
texas.
one
of
them
was
written
by
mr.
price.
it's
here
at
the
table,
the
first
one.
two
of
these
pertain
to
the
leasing
of
property
of
a
state-supported
educational
institution.
first
one
of
them
is
texas
tech
at
lubbock.
the
next
one
is
the
university
of
texas
in
austin.
both
of
them
are
instrumentalities
of
the
state.
they
are
state-supported
educational
institutions
and
their
property
would
be
exempt
from
the
operation
of
the
michigan
statute
as
it
is
from
the
operation
of
the
texas
statutes.
there's
no
difference
there.
i
might
mention
also
that
because
it
has
already
been
brought
into
this
argument
and
that
is
that
this
first
opinion
talks
about
pantex.
we
call
it.
it's
pantex
ordnance
plant
in
--
in
the
carson
county,
texas
over
near
amarillo
which
was
mentioned
yesterday,
i
believe,
both
by
mr.
clifford
and
by
mr.
davis
as
being
property
where
the
state
of
texas
owns
it
and
leases
it
and
that
it
is
a
big
ordnance
plant
too.
now,
the
--
we're
outside
the
record
on
this
of
course,
because
we're
talking
about
briefs
and
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
trial
court.
but
i
think
this
opinion
shows
in
and
of
itself
and
it
is
a
fact
that
pantex
ordnance
plant
was
deeded
to
texas
tech
with
a
recapture
clause
shortly
before
the
korean
war.
when
the
korean
war
broke
out,
that
recapture
clause
was
exercised
by
the
united
states
and
the
manufacturing
and
commercial
facilities
at
pantex
ordnance
plant
were
recaptured
by
the
united
states
and
are
now
being
operated
by
the
united
states
as
a
manufacturing
plant
for
actual
components
for
atomic
bombs.
they
are
being
operated
by
silas
mason
incorporated
and
mason
&
hanger.
that's
--
that's
what
pantex
is
except
for
that
property
which
texas
tech
has
around
the
fringes
which
include
a
few
building,
some
of
which
are
leased
to
our
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
table,
phillips
chemical
company,
as
the
opinion
shows
for
storage
purposes
and
the
rest
of
which
is
used
by
texas
tech
for
educational
purposes
with
the
exception
of
some
grazing
leases
and
some
farming
leases.
but
whatever
use
is
being
made
by
texas
tech
in
the
way
of
leasing
would
be
exempted
under
the
michigan
statute
as
well
as
under
the
texas
statutes.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
don't
know
exactly,
your
honor.
this
wasn't
in
the
record
and
i'm
just
not
familiar
but
my
recollection
is
from
what
i've
been
able
to
find
out
that
probably
half
a
dozen
or
maybe
many
as
10
farmers
have
little
tracks
leased
in
it.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir,
that
is
true.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
the
--
the
state
has
no
lease
on
the
manufacturing
plant
of
the
arsenal
that
is
the
ordnance
plant
itself.
that's
being
--
it
was
operated
for
a
number
of
years
by
procter
&
gamble
defense
corporation
now
being
operated
by
silas
mason.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
the
state
didn't
have
a
lease,
they
had
title
to
it
at
one
time.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
no,
sir.
not
that
i
know
of.
it
was
recaptured,
as
i
understand
it,
within
about
six
months
from
the
time
the
deed
was
signed.
i
believe
that's
what
this
opinion
shows
essentially
just
a
few
months
after
the
deed
was
signed
from
the
government
too
the
texas
tech.
one
of
these,
the
state
of
texas
deeded
texas
technological
college
which
is
a
state-supported
educational
institution
at
lubbock.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
you
didn't
understand
him,
your
honor.
he
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
texas
tech,
which
an
instrumentality
of
the
state,
does
lease
the
part
of
it,
they
did
now
have
part
of
it
not
all
of
it.
it
uses
it
--
their
studying
the
bull
progeny
up
there,
they
used
it
for
studying
the
breeding
habits
of
bulls
and
how
good
and
cows
and
calves
they
produce
and
so
forth
and
--
and
do
other
things.
it's
the
state
--
it's
the
texas
tech
farm
is
what
it
is
and
part
of
it,
excess
to
their
immediate
needs,
is
leased
out
for
private
purposes
including
some
storeys
of
building,
as
i
understand
it,
that
phillips
chemical
company
leases.
but
those
are
leased
not
by
the
state
of
texas
but
by
our
texas
technological
college
which
is
the
state-supported
educational
institution,
and
as
i
say
it
would
be
exempted
under
the
provisions
of
the
michigan
statute
as
well
as
it
is
here.
those
are
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
this
was
pantex
ordnance
plant.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
in
panhandle
--
near
panhandle,
texas
in
carson
county,
and
it
was
a
shell
loading
plant,
as
i
understand,
during
the
war
but
i
didn't
live
in
that
part
of
the
state
and
one
for
me
at
that
time,
i
just
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
the
manufacturing
arsenal
part,
the
part
that
was
used
as
the
shell
loading
plant
during
the
war
and
is
now
used
as
a
manufacturing
plant
for
the
manufacture
of
--
what
they
call
nuclear
components
--
components
of
nuclear
weapons,
i
believe
they
say
it.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
they
have
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir,
some
of
the
outlying
land
from
it,
not
the
manufacturing
part
of
the
commercial-industrial
part.
they
have
--
they
do
not
have
that.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
that
whole
arsenal
originally
included
about
20
--
20
sections
of
land
and
--
and
just
how
much
of
it
texas
tech
still
has,
i
--
i'm
not
sure.
i
just
don't
--
i've
been
there,
and
i've
seen
it
and
--
but
i'm
just
not
sure.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
no,
sir,
it's
right
northeast
of
amarillo
about
15
miles.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
they
gave
it
direct
to
the
school,
your
honor.
that
deed
was
from
the
united
states
government
directed
to
texas
tech
with
the
recapture
clause
and
also
a
condition
that
it'd
be
held
and
used
for
educational
purposes
for
20
years.
i
read
that
deed
in
somewhat
familiar
with
this.
we
represent
the
panhandle
school
district
and
--
and
i've
looked
into
it
a
little
bit
but
not
thoroughly,
your
honor.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
panhandle.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
no
pantex
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
--
p-a-n-t-e-x
from
panhandle
texas,
i
think,
the
abbreviation.
well,
these
examples
show,
it
seems
to
me,
quite
clearly
that
most
of
the
property
in
texas
that
is
subject
to
lease,
let
alone
what
may
be
leased
and
we
don't
know
what
it
leased
because
we
have
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
show.
but
most
of
what
is
even
subject
to
lease
is
of
the
type
of
property
that
would
be
exempted
from
the
operation
of
the
michigan
statute.
i'd
like
to
point
out
also
that
the
michigan
statute,
as
this
court
knew
it
was
in
the
record
in
the
michigan
case,
was
designed
primarily
to
tax
federal
property.
at
page
53
of
appellee's
brief
in
this
case
is
quoted
a
little
statement
from
the
record
and
the
township
of
muskegon
case,
it
was
found
at
page
58
of
the
record
there
and
it
represents
a
statement
made
by
mr.
street
who
was
from
muskegon
and
was
counsel
for
the
orchard
view
school
district,
one
of
the
parties
to
that
case
to
the
trial
court.
he
said,
“act
189
of
1953
was
obviously
a
remedial
or
curative
statute
designed
to
supplement
the
general
property
tax
and
amounting
to
an
amendment
thereto.
it
arose
the
because
of
a
claim
then
being
asserted
that
this
and
other
similar
properties
in
the
state
have
become
exempt
or
would
become
exempt
within
the
near
future
by
transfer
of
title
thereto
from
rfc
to
the
united
states
or
some
agency
exempt
from
taxation.
the
act
was
passed
to
avoid
the
dissent
or
consequences
upon
the
local
units
of
government.
that
was
in
the
record
in
the
muskegon
case.
further,
the
record
shows,
i
don't
have
the
pages.
i
borrowed
under
those
briefs
and
things
earlier
and
read
some
of
them.
i
don't
recall
exactly
how
much
but
that
the
record
did
show
that
there
was
very
little
actual
taxation
of
any
property
other
than
federal
under
the
michigan
statute.
the
record
in
that
case
will
reflect
that.
thus,
it
seems
to
us
that
both
by
the
reasoning
of
the
michigan
statute
and
the
michigan
cases
and
by
the
authority
and
the
legal
precedents
of
the
michigan
cases,
particularly
borg-warner,
that
the
texas
statute,
there's
no
more
guilty
of
discrimination
against
the
federal
government
or
those
with
whom
it
deals
and
was
the
michigan
statute.
and
that
--
for
that
reason,
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
we
pass
then
to
the
question
of
classification.
assuming
that
there
is
a
distinction
and
assuming
that
there
is
some
difference
between
sthe
texas
classification
system
as
exemplified
in
each
statutes,
article
5248
and
the
others
which
--
with
which
it
must
be
considered,
can
there
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
those
differences?
assuming
arguendo
that
there
are
and
they
were
not
governed
by
the
michigan
statute.
the
rule
for
classification
has
been
stated
from
the
bench
in
this
court
during
argument.
any
classification
for
taxation
is
proper.
this
court
has
held
in,
perhaps,
several
hundred
cases.
if
any
reasonable
basis
can
be
conceived
for
that
difference
in
classification,
a
classification
is
not
arbitrary,
it's
not
discriminatory,
it's
not
invidious,
if
some
reasonable
basis
exist.
further,
there
is
a
presumption
of
validity,
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
which
attaches
to
a
state
taxing
statute.
and
the
burden
of
proving
the
invalidity
is
upon
the
appellant
in
this
case.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
if
anything
can
be
reasonably
conceived,
not
shown
or
proved
but
reasonably
conceived,
that
is
true.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
well,
some
cases
have
held
that,
i
believe,
your
honor,
but
others
have
held
that
the
motives
of
the
legislature
are
important.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
that's
true.
but
the
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir,
which
we
believe
is
not
shown
here
your
honor.
it
has
been
conceded
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
recognize
that
your
honor.
but
it
has
been
conceded
by
counsel
for
appellant
here
as
well
counsel
for
the
united
states
that
even
a
class
of
federal
lessees
could
be
proper.
and
that
what
this
court
has
meant
when
it
has
said
as
it
said
in
the
borg-warner
case
that
it
still
remains
true
as
it
has
from
the
beginning
that
a
tax
classification
maybe
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
therefore
void
if
it
discriminates
against
the
united
states
for
those
against
or
those
with
whom
it
deals.
we
are
not
talking
about
just
pointing
out
federal
lessees,
but
we're
talking
about
discriminating
against
them,
not
distinguishing
them
or
using
a
distinction
in
tax
treatment
but
discrimination.
that
is
the
key,
it
seems
to
me,
to
those
statements
found
in
the
opinions
of
this
court.
we're
not
talking
about
distinction,
we're
talking
about
actual
discrimination.
and
if
the
class
of
federal
lessees
or
users
and
occupiers
of
federal
property
is
based
on
reasonable
grounds,
it
should
be
a
valid
classification.
again,
as
i
say,
it
has
been
conceded.
the
only
prohibition
is
against
discrimination,
not
against
classification.
there
are
examples
of
that
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
where
the
courts
have
held
statutes
obviously
designed
to
tax
the
interest
on
government
bond,
the
income
from
copyrights,
the
income
from
patents
and
other
rights
where
the
obvious
purpose
was
that,
yet
nevertheless
because
the
classification
was
not
deemed
arbitrary
or
invidious,
this
taxing
statute
was
upheld.
in
fact
then,
is
the
classification
adopted
by
the
state
of
texas
here
a
reasonable
classification?
is
there
a
reasonable
basis
for
it?
if
there
is,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
the
tax
statute
is
valid,
that
it
does
not
rough
out
of
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
are
the
only
limitations
upon
state
taxing
power
and
which
this
court
has
said
are
not
very
broad
limitations
upon
that
power.
in
1945,
when
the
war
was
over,
the
united
states
found
itself
the
owner
of
a
vast
and
unique
mass
of
commercial
and
industrial
property.
the
hearing
before
the
senate
and
the
adoption
of
military
leasing
act,
the
national
industrial
reserve
act
of
1948
reflected
that
the
government
owned
approximately
1200
industrial
and
commercial
plants
that
had
cost
the
government
about
$14
billion.
mr.
davis
told
us
on
yesterday
that
that
amount
has
now
been
increased
to
$18
billion.
the
government
is
the
owner
of
this
last
mass
of
property.
and
it
is
the
only
owner,
the
only
exempt
owner
or
non-exempt
owner
of
such
a
vast
mass
of
property.
we
talk
about
a
big
corporation.
a
billion
dollar
corporation
is
a
big
one.
this
is
an
$18
billion
corporation
just
in
value
of
its
asset
subject
to
lease
alone.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
that
is
true
your
honor.
but
that
argument
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
the
argument
gets
me,
as
i
understand
my
argument,
which
we
will
proceed
along,
but
it
will
get
me
eventually
to
the
proposition
that
the
impact
of
the
leasing
of
this
upon
the
local
economy
and
upon
the
taxing
situation
of
the
areas
in
which
this
property
is
located
is
such
as
to
raise
a
problem
which
demands
solution
your
honor.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir,
that
is
true.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
it
consented,
your
honor,
to
the
taxation
of
the
lessees
and
risk
may
have
created
under
the
provision
of
this
act.
that's
the
wording
of
it.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
the
lessees'
interest
in
this
plant
maybe
has
varied
from
state
to
state
as
the
taxation
of
rfc
property
has
been
held
to
be
under
--
in
the
beaver
county
case,
that
is,
it
maybe
one
thing
in
one
state
and
one
in
another.
in
new
york,
in
the
riverhead
case
your
honor,
the
lessees
entered,
it
was
such
that
it
was
personal
property
and
was
not
taxed
--
subject
to
taxation
by
the
local
units
of
government,
the
same
under
this
farm
&
garden
case
in
massachusetts
and
the
(inaudible)
aircraft
case
in
california.
but
in
other
states,
the
san
bernardino
county
case
in
new
mexico,
the
(inaudible)
case
in
maryland,
the
(inaudible)
case
in
new
jersey,
lee
county
housing
case
in
georgia,
the
personal
housing
case
in
missouri
and
in
state
after
state,
the
lessees
interest
has
been
held
to
be
a
taxable
interest
to
one
kind
or
another.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
the
supreme
court
of
texas
held
that
it
was
the
right
of
use
and
occupancy
for
profit
of
this
property.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
that's
what
i
say
too
your
honor.
that's
what
we
are
contended
in
this
case
for
five
years
that
that
is
what
it
is
--
that
that
is
a
right,
a
property
right,
intangible,
yes,
but
a
property
right
which
is
subject
to
taxation.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
it's
--
it
seemed
plain
in
a
way,
yet
the
first
part
of
the
statute
saying
that
property
of
the
united
states
is
exempt
from
taxation
which
is
a
plain
statement
of
an
existing
fact,
of
course,
merely,
would
not
be
considered
subject
to
being
turn
that
around
and
the
opposite
thing
said
in
the
very
same
statute
in
a
proviso,
there
is
a
presumption
of
validity.
a
legislature
will
not
be
presumed
to
have
done
a
vain
and
useless
thing.
if
a
statute
can
be
so
read
and
construed
as
to
make
it
constitutional,
it
should
be
done.
the
state
of
texas
by
its
supreme
court
has
held
that
that's
what
the
statute
said.
there
were
four
dissenters
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
but
two
of
them,
justices
walker
and
calvert
had
no
trouble
with
that
proposition.
they
said
in
their
opinion
that
we
agree
with
the
majority,
that
that's
what
the
statute
intended.
in
michigan,
we
had
the
same
difficulty.
there
was
an
omission
in
the
statutory
wording
in
michigan.
it
had
to
be
supplied
with
the
courts,
it
was
supplied.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
that
is
my
understanding
from
what
these
courts
have
said
about
that
tax,
your
honor.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
your
honor,
i
contend
that
it
makes
no
difference
to
what
it
is.
i
contend
--
the
appellants
have
said
that
in
texas
we
cannot
have
a
use
or
privilege
tax.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
so.
justice
garwood
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
it's
found
in
the
record
at
page
194.
that's
the
last
thing
he
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
in
this
connection,
there
can
now
be
little
doubt
that
a
use
tax
on
lessees,
whether
long-term
or
short
term,
a
use
tax
of
exempt
property
measured
by
the
value
of
the
premises
would
be
valid
under
our
state
constitution
as
it
evidently
is
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
constitutional
inhibition
against
it.
a
tax
did
not
require
a
label
your
honor
to
be
valid.
we
don't
have
to
call
it
a
use
or
privilege
tax.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
didn't
say
that
the
tax
in
borg-warner
was
a
privilege
tax.
they
said
it
is
a
specific
tax
on
the
privilege
of
using
the
property.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
not
necessarily.
the
privilege
of
using
a
property
maybe
a
property
interest.
justice
holmes
said
it
was
in
trimble
against
city
of
seattle.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
i
know
that's
what
i
say.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
the
same
way
you
get
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
a
lessee's
interest,
i
think,
the
supreme
court
said
that's
what
it
meant,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
say
that
in
words.
it's
construed
to
mean
that.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
think
that
is
true.
but
the
supreme
court
of
texas
is
pointing
out
that
article
7173
and
7174
of
the
old
statute
providing
for
taxes
on
the
leasehold,
the
case
construing
that
daugherty
against
thompson
said
that
in
the
absence
of
a
statute
so
providing,
then
the
lease
shall
be
taxable
less
than
so.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
said
this
is
a
statute
so
providing.
it
provides
for
a
tax
upon
an
interest.
perhaps,
an
interest
created
or
recognized
for
the
first
time
in
the
statute
itself
that
interest,
a
right
of
use
and
occupation
of
this
property,
a
privilege
tax
upon
it,
an
ad
valorem
tax
upon
the
property
right
of
use
and
occupation.
this
court
said
in
the
murray
case,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
we
tax
one
for
the
use
of
property
which
he
possess
or
the
possession
of
property
which
he
uses,
the
label
is
immaterial.
we
say
the
label
is
immaterial
here.
it
makes
no
difference
if
it's
a
use
or
privilege
or
ad
valorem
tax.
you
can
call
it
what
you
want
to
in
this
court.
in
michigan,
the
statute
was
in
the
ad
valorem
property
section
of
the
michigan
statutes
and
yet
it
was
held
to
be
a
privilege
or
use
tax
by
this
court,
not
specifically
deemed
to
be
that
before
it
got
to
this
court.
the
michigan
supreme
court
said
merely
that
it
is
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
use
of
the
property,
specific
tax.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes
sir,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
no
distinction.
there
should
be
no
distinction.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
that's
not
my
entire
position,
your
honor
but
in
--
in
this
area
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
perhaps
it
does
your
honor,
and
perhaps
i
--
i
misunderstand
the
different
positions
that
you
and
mr.
justice
whittaker
are
taking
in
this
instance.
but
i
say
it
makes
no
difference
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you
call
it
one
or
the
other.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you
wipe
out
the
distinction
between
them
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir,
that
is
true.
the
difference
is
if
--
if
it
is
a
tax
on
a
legitimate
property
interest
or
a
tax
upon
a
legitimate
privilege
which
is
subject
to
taxation
that
it
makes
no
difference
what
you
call.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
i
see
by
the
light
that
i
must
hurry.[laughter]
there
--
there
is
no
comparable
property
in
texas
to
this
property.
we
have
the
laws
of
tax
revenues
on
the
local
instrumentalities
of
government
that
are
forced
to
furnish
school
services,
roads,
court
services,
police
protection,
all
the
other
incidents
of
local
governance.
they're
required
to
be
furnished
to
these
lessees.
there
are
no
comparable
lessees
anywhere
else
except
those
using
property
that
they
have
leased
from
the
federal
government.
therefore,
this
alone,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
valid
basis
for
this
distinction.
we
need
this
equality
of
tax
treatment
for
several
reasons.
first,
we
need
to
adjust
the
equities
between
the
taxpayers.
here
is
the
taxpayer
using
federal
property
exempt
from
taxation,
he
pays
no
taxes,
he
pays
no
part
of
the
cost
of
the
burdens
of
local
government.
local
government
is
supposed
to
be
paid
for
by
those
who
receive
its
benefit,
this
court
has
said
so.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
no,
sir,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
i
am.
i
think
that
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
i
think
that
is
the
crux
of
this
case
that
the
equities
that
this
court
has
pointed
to
have
been
important.
in
the
borg-warner
case
and
in
the
other
cases
are
important
here.
i'm
merely
trying
to
get
my
point
over
before
this
other
light
comes
on,
your
honor,
if
i
seem
to
be
hurrying.[laughter]
congress
had
not
only
consented
to
this
permission
to
tax
the
lessee's
interest
but
by
doing
so
if
it
has
not
completely
answered
the
constitutional
question,
it
had
at
least
highlighted
this
one
thing.
it
has
highlighted
the
basis
for
distinction
because
it
has
known
and
it
has
shown
that
there
is
a
valid
basis
for
classification.
another
thing
congress
has
created
a
class.
it
has
created
a
class
of
federal
lessees
itself
here.
and
if
this
court
pose
that
the
state
of
texas
cannot
tax
those
lessees,
then
this
court
will
avail
that
congress
has
discriminated
against
other
users
of
property
in
texas.
and
that
the
discrimination
will
be
on
the
other
foot.
this
is
not
a
tax
on
federal
property
your
honors.
the
texas
court
held
that
it
was
not.
seven
of
the
nine
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
all
three
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
the
trial
judge
have
held
that
it
was
not
a
tax
on
federal
property.
it
is
--
this
is
a
question
of
state
law,
it
seems
to
us,
that
nevertheless
hadn't
been
injected,
we
would
say
that
it
is
not
on
federal
property.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes
sir,
i
understand.
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
how
does
it
differ
from
allegheny?
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
it
differs
from
allegheny,
your
honor,
in
that
it
--
the
interest
of
the
lessee
was
assessed
here.
now,
the
assessment
sheets
which
have
been
brought
in,
they
say
that
it
does
not
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
the
difference
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes,
sir.
the
weight
fell
there
on
--
it's
a
little
difficult
to
see
but,
of
course,
it's
little
difficult
to
see
much
validity
in
allegheny
anymore
anyway
in
my
opinion.
and
--
mr.
earnest
l.
langley
yes
sir.[laughter]
i
think
it
is
a
good
answer,
your
honor.
