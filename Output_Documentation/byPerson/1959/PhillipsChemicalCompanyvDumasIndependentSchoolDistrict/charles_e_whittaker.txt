justice
charles
e.
whittaker
who
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
who
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
how
do
you
--
(inaudible)
is
this
a
tax
and
that
we
find
that
the
(inaudible)
except
the
lessee
or
this
is
the
plain
word
(inaudible)
and
at
any
portion
of
federal
lands
which
is
being
used
or
occupied
that
in
(inaudible)
shall
be
for
taxation
by
the
state
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
your
position
of
these
portions
of
the
federal
lands
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
essential.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
langley,
so
that
i
might
understand
in
the
answer
to
justice
frankfurter.
you
say
that
a
church
that
leases
property
is
liable
for
the
taxes
or
is
it
just
the
property
that
maybe
impressed
with
the
lien
of
the
tax?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words
both.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
unless
excluded
by
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
langley
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
may
i
ask
you
please?
you
answered
justice
frankfurter
that
you
admit
that
the
state
could
not
directly
tax
federally
owned
lands.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
without
the
consent
of
congress.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
by
the
military
leasing
act
of
1947,
congress
gave
some
consent.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
understand
it
consented
might
be
taxed
in
respect
of
federally
owned
property?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now,
what's
the
lessee's
interest
in
this
cactus
plant?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now,
in
this
case,
the
lessee
has
a
lease
for
a
term
of
years.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
represents
its
interest,
does
it
not
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
whatever
you
may
call
it
under
the
local
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
i
understand
that
your
statute
5248,
isn't
it,
that
was
--
amended
in
1950?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
authorizes
taxation
of
something,
now,
what
is
it
that
that
statute
authorizes
to
be
taxed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
what
do
you
say
it
authorizes
to
be
taxed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
doesn't
the
statute
say
that
any
portion
of
said
lands
being
federal
lands
which
is
used
or
occupied
in
the
conduct
of
private
business
shall
be
subject
to
taxation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
is
plain?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
one
more
question
and
i'm
through,
if
i
may,
please.
the
michigan
cases
upheld,
as
i
understand,
a
privilege
tax,
is
that
not
your
understanding?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
do
you
contend
that
the
texas
tax
is
a
privilege
or
an
ad
valorem
tax?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
that
to
say
that
it's
a
use
tax?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
say
specifically
in
5248,
the
tax
shall
be
on
the
portion
of
the
federal
lands
devoted
to
private
use.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
how
do
you
get
a
use
tax
out
of
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
phillips
concedes
that
if
it
were
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
the
value
of
the
leasehold,
they
would
have
no
defense
to
it,
would
they
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
--
do
you
argue
--
do
i
correctly
understand
your
brief
to
argue
that
we
should
wipe
out
all
distinctions
in
such
matters
between
privilege
and
ad
valorem
taxes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
aren't
you
making
a
dumas
county
jury
argument
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
quite
right?
does
it
not
in
the
first
section
say
you
cannot
tax
federal
property
unless
it
has
been
leased?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
what
was
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
the
interest
created
here
in
the
lessee
is
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
you're
saying
it
is
a
--
a
use
or
privilege
tax
and
not
an
ad
valorem
tax?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
do
you
think
we
--
we
are
bound
or
can
be
bound
by
what
texas
says
in
that
regard
if
includes
it
is
a
tax
on
federal
land?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
understand
the
petitioner
to
contest
that.
he
just
says
you
haven't
done
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
words
--
i
--
i'm
going
to
ask
you
another
question,
this
is
my
last
one
but
for
the
policy,
but
what
words
do
you
rely
on
in
your
statute
to
create
here
a
privilege
tax
other
than
the
words
in
5248
saying
that
any
portion
of
said
federal
lands
which
is
being
used
or
occupied
for
private
business
shall
be
subject
to
taxation.
is
that
at
all
you
rely
on?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
there
any
other?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
give
it
--
we
have
great
difficulty
about
this
type
of
thing
among
ourselves.
giving
intention
to
the
--
giving
effect
to
the
intention
of
the
legislature,
contrary
to
the
words
it's
used
or
consonant
with
them?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
the
state
of
texas,
on
its
property
that
it
has
leased,
is
getting
a
return
of
as
much
as
1%
a
month.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it
maybe
an
involuntary
landlord
such
as
the
government
is
here.
property
designed
for
other
uses
is
not
doing
the
best
it
can
indirectly.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
the
original
record
of
transcript
with
the
clerk
--
i
don't
(inaudible)
of
that
transcript.
is
that
transcript
on
the
file
here?
