mr.
jack
n.
price
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
this
question
of
--
of
whether
or
not
this
tax
is
on
federal
property
where
or
is
only
lessee's
interest
seems
to
be
very
much
bothering
the
court.
actually,
we
thought
that
our
real
problem
here
was
discrimination,
and
i
would
like
to
treat
that,
but
first,
i
think
we
might
as
well
go
right
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
its
owned
federal
property.
well,
i
don't
argue
with
the
--
and
i
can't
argue
with
what
mr.
justice
whittaker
says
the
statute
says
because
he
is
reading
it
to
me.
but
just
like
mr.
langley
pointed
out
in
the
first
section
of
that
same
statute,
article
5248,
its
clearly
evidence
is
that
the
legislative
is
aware
that
it
cannot
tax
federal
property.
it
would
be
very
useless
and
vain
for
them
turn
it
right
around
in
the
same
section
and
say
we're
going
to
tax
it
anyway.
now,
there's
another
statute
that
gives
an
exemption.
mr.
jack
n.
price
you're
right,
your
honor.
well,
that
is
not
exactly
what
it
said.
it
says
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
--
you
cannot
tax
federal
property
that
is
used
for
public
purposes.
so
we
can
put
that
point
to
rest
by
going
to
article
7150,
section
4
of
the
texas
statute
which
gives
a
complete
immunity
or
exemption
to
all
federal
property
in
the
state.
therefore,
there
are
two
exemptions
provisions
in
the
state
of
texas.
and
the
legislature
must
be
deemed
to
be
fully
aware
that
it
cannot
tax
federal
property.
now,
our
legislature
can't
be
accused
of
being
composed
of
constitutional
lawyers.
therefore,
we
can't
say
that
we
can't
just
look
at
the
language
that
it
used
and
then
hold
it
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
because
of
the
language
they
used.
now,
if
you'll
examine
the
history
of
the
amendment,
the
article
5248,
you'll
see
that
it
was
passed
by
the
first
session
of
the
legislature
to
convene
after
the
enactment
of
the
military
leasing
act
in
1947.
the
first
legislature
convened
in
--
in
1949,
and
it
was
passed
by
the
first
call
of
session
of
that
legislature
effective
march
17th,
1950.
mr.
jack
n.
price
if
there
was,
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
know
of
it.
i
had
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
it's
very
sketchy,
your
honor.
it
--
it
does
record
debates.
but
i
believe
that
this
very
history,
evidence
is
a
fact
that
what
the
legislature
was
seeking
to
tax
was
only
that
for
which
expressed
permission
had
been
given
to
tax.
mr.
jack
n.
price
that
was
the
interest
created
under
these
military
leases.
mr.
jack
n.
price
your
honor,
we
--
we
consider
that
the
right
of
use
an
occupancy
of
valuable
federal
property,
federal
industrial
property,
is
the
right
that
is
created
and
is
the
right
that
is
vested
in
the
lessee.
now,
we
contend
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
you
label
this
ad
valorem,
use,
privilege,
excise
or
put
any
of
the
label
on
it,
because
when
you
view
its
constitutionality,
you
view
its
practical
operation
and
effect.
and
if
it
is
constitutional
by
that
test,
you
cannot
condemn
it
merely
because
of
its
label.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
your
honor,
i'll
have
to
echo
mr.
langley
on
that
point.
i'm
saying
that
we
contend,
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
we
--
we
would
like
to
point
out
however
in
answer
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes
sir,
otherwise
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
otherwise,
the
amendments
article
5248
would
be
vain,
meaningless,
useless,
and
unconstitutional
and
the
legislature
will
not
be
presumed
to
have
done
a
vain
or
unconstitutional
thing.
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
it
is
not
a
tax
on
federal
property.
i
don't
believe
there
should
be
any
question
about
that.
it's
certainly
would
not
have
gotten
this
far
through
the
texas
courts
if
it
were
a
tax
on
federal
property.
mr.
jack
n.
price
your
honor,
i'll
answer
that
this
way.
i
would
say
that
ordinarily,
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
past,
that
the
incidence
of
a
state
levy
or
exaction
is
a
question
of
state
law.
in
this
case,
it
has
been
decided
adversely.
now,
we
would
say
that
the
court
is
not
bound
by
that
certainly,
if
the
practical
operation
and
effect
is
otherwise.
but
examine
the
practical
operation
and
effect
of
this
tax,
you'll
find
that
it
is
not
otherwise.
now,
we
are
not
opinioned
to
the
position
that
this
tax
has
to
be
an
ad
valorem
tax.
and
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
clifford's
argument
in
this
respect
where
he
says
it
--
only,
a
school
district
in
texas
may
levy,
only
an
ad
valorem
tax.
and
for
authority
for
this,
he
quotes
article
7,
section
3
in
his
brief
at
page
41.
and
he
quotes
this
portion.
he
says,
“the
legislature
shall
be
authorized
to
pass
laws
for
the
assessment
and
collection
of
taxes.”
and
all
said
districts,
referring
to
school
districts,
and
for
the
management
and
control
of
the
public
school
or
schools
of
such
districts.
now,
here
he
has
an
omission.
there's
an
interjecting
thought
here
that
he
does
not
put
in
and
then
he
proceeds
to
say,
“and
the
legislature
may
authorize
an
additional
ad
valorem
tax
to
be
levied
and
collected
with
our
school
districts.”
now,
there
is
your
only
reference
in
that
section
to
ad
valorem
taxes.
and
i
assume
that
--
that
putting
it
this
way
that
mr.
clifford
would
like
to
rely
upon
the
theory
of
houston
general.
but
i
think
he's
sort
of
reversed
the
application
of
it
here
because
here,
the
general
precedes
a
specific
and
therefore,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question
of
that.
if
--
if
there
is
any
question
of
it,
it's
put
to
rest
in
another
constitutional
provision
of
the
texas
constitution
which
is
article
8,
section
17
which
says
that
the
enumeration
of
objects
and
subjects
of
taxation
in
the
state
constitution
shall
not
limit
the
legislature
in
their
selection
of
subjects
and
objects
for
taxation.
and
if
they
deem
it
necessary,
they
can
select
other
objects
and
subjects
of
taxation.
consequently,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
genuine
question
but
that
the
state
legislature
could
authorize
the
imposition
of
a
use
or
privilege
tax
by
the
school
district
or
any
other
subdivisions
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
he
contends
that
we
haven't
done
it.
but
i
--
i
do
understand
him
to
say
that
--
that
this
is
contested
because
the
very
heading
of
this
section
that
i'm
reading
from
on
his
brief,
page
41,
says
this
--this
construction
of
chapter
37
which
is
the
amendment's
article
5248
is
required
by
the
texas
constitution
and
accords
with
the
texas
taxing
system.
mr.
jack
n.
price
certainly,
it
is,
your
honor.
but
really,
our
position
is
this.
that
it
does
not
matter
if,
by
practical
operation
and
effect,
this
tax
is
constitutional,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
michigan
cases
leave
any
doubt
but
that
it
is,
because
in
the
michigan
cases,
you
had
a
similar
incidence
for
the
tax.
you
had
it
measured
by
exactly
the
same
thing
it
is
measured
here.
and
further,
in
the
murray
case,
you'll
remember,
you
didn't
levy
it
under
a
general
statute
or
an
enabling
statute,
you
levied
the
tax
or
they
levied
the
tax
under
their
general
ad
valorem
tax
structure.
and
it
was
specifically
defined
an
ad
valorem
tax
and
they
were
stuck
with
that
in
michigan,
but
this
court
found
that
that
was
no
fatal
defect,
that
the
mere
omission
of
the
words
that
this
shall
be
considered
a
use
tax
could
be
supplied
whereas
practical
operation
and
effect
were
the
same.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
those
--
those
words
are
not
absent
in
our
statute.
you
need
not
go
so
far
to
supply
them
in
our
statute.
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
sir.
we
cannot
rely
on
those
words.
if
we
rely
on
those
words
in
literal
--
in
literal
construction,
your
honor,
as
you
had
pointed
out,
that
covers
the
property.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
yes,
it
is
the
duty
of
these
courts,
not
only
the
state
courts
but
the
federal
courts,
if
it
is
possible
to
give
effect
to
the
intendment
of
the
legislature.
now,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
legislature
knew
it
couldn't
tax
federal
property.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
--
that
the
proper
role
of
the
court
is
to
give
the
construction
that
would
uphold
its
constitutionality
unless
that
construction
is
absolutely
precluded
by
the
wording
of
the
statute.
and
i
don't
believe
it's
precluded
here.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
the
--
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
way,
i
say
it's
not
precluded
because
of
the
--
your
regular
canons
of
statutory
construction,
your
other
extraneous
aid
that
you
--
you
resort
to,
to
construe
a
statute
like
the
legislative
history
that
i've
pointed
out
and
your
canons
of
construction
that
you
can't
give
it
construction
that
would
render
it
unconstitutional
or
make
it
a
vain
gesture.
and
you
can
presume
from
the
fact
that
the
legislature
has
two
specific
exemption
statutes
already
on
the
books
of
texas
giving
complete
exemption
on
federal
property
that
they
knew
they
couldn't
tax
federal
property
that
they
were
intending
to.
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
n.
price
pardon
me.
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes
sir,
i
can.
i'll
summarize
mr.
langley's
argument
on
discrimination
and
how
this
amendment's
article
5248
fits
into
our
tax
structure
this
way.
there
is
certain
basic
proposition.
first,
privately
owned
tax-exempt
property
when
leased
for
private
purposes
looses
its
exemption
entirely.
and
i
have
laboriously
set
this
forth
in
pages
7
through
20
of
my
brief
and
shown
just
where
and
in
what
respect,
what
cases
held
it
and
what
constitutional
limitations
there
was
or
on
every
part
of
privately
owned
tax-exempt
property
in
texas.
therefore,
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can
consider
privately
owned
tax-exempt
property
in
relation
to
this
question
of
discrimination.
if
there
is
any
discrimination,
it
must
be
found
from
a
different
source
or
from
the
difference
in
tax
payment
between
lessees
of
federally
owned
property
and
lessees
of
a
different
type
of
tax-exempt
property
other
than
privately
owned
tax-exempt
property
which
leaves
only
state
property.
now,
state
property
can
be
leased
without
loosing
its
exemption
if,
one,
and
the
cases
have
construed
the
constitution
to
mean
this.
the
leasing
is
of
a
temporary
nature.
two,
all
revenues
derived
from
the
leasing
and
they're
exclusively
to
the
public
benefit.
and
three
that
the
public
purpose
of
the
property
cannot
be
abandoned,
and
by
that,
they
mean
that
there
must
be
an
eventual
retaking
of
this
property
and
devoting
it
to
public
purposes.
those
are
the
limitations
upon
the
leasing
of
state
property.
now,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
state
property,
and
mr.
langley
had
described
that
property
and
i
won't
bother
with
it
that
is
expressly
made
subject
to
taxation.
i'll
describe
it
only
as
being
the
type
that
is
actually
characteristically
available
for
leasing
like
the
university
property
or
county
school
lands.
and
then
there's
--
is
another
proposition
or
it's
the
last
proposition
in
this
entire
framework.
we
see
the
state
property
which
is
not
expressly
made
subject
to
taxation
and
which
is
leased
so
as
to
preserve
its
exemption
will
be
taxed
to
the
lessee
with
the
fair
cash
market
value
of
the
lease
under
article
7173
and
7174
and
i
would
assume
that
those
statutes
still
apply,
although
i
can
see
no
other
applicability
of
those
two
particular
statutes
to
any
property
other
than
state
property,
which
is
leased
so
as
to
preserve
its
exemption.
now,
it
is
--
this
--
this
question
of
discrimination
must
be
resolve
in
that
light.
in
other
words,
you
got
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
slight
differentiation
in
actual
tax
or
economic
treatment
of
the
two
types
of
lessees
is
sufficient
to
vitiate
the
classification
erected
by
the
operation
of
article
5248.
and
for
that,
we
go
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
classification
that
this
court
has
devised,
and
that
is,
whether
or
not,
there's
any
reasonable
basis
for
the
classification.
whether
or
not,
it
is
invidiously
discriminatory
or
--
or
probably
arbitrary.
whether
or
not,
it
rests
upon
some
basis
having
a
fair
and
substantial
relation
even
to
the
object
of
the
legislation
or
to
the
public
policy
of
the
state,
and
the
last
requirement
that
i've
been
able
to
gleam
from
the
cases
is
that
all
those
similarly
circumstance
must
be
treated
alike.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
of
course,
this
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
seriously
could
be
for
this
reason,
that
the
united
states
government
has
its
recapture
clause
or
this
--
the
lease
termination
clause
so
that
the
--
it
is
contemplated
that
they
may
need
it
for
national
emergency.
and
that
the
state
had
any
comparable
property
and
made
such
comparable
lease
provision,
then
it
would
be,
i
think
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
--
it
would
be
evidenced
that
they
were
going
to
devote
it
to
a
public
use
in
future.
but
however
that
--
that
assumes
something
that
it
really
goes
to
our
basis
for
the
classification
and
that
is
that
the
--
the
state
has
any
such
comparable
property
or
can
create
any
such
a
comparable
class
of
lessee
than
it
does
not
have
such
a
class
of
property
and
it
cannot
create
such
a
class
of
lessees.
if
you'll
just
look
at
the
military
leasing
act
itself,
it's
pretty
evident
that
the
federal
congress
knew,
united
state
congress
knew
that
under
this
act,
there
would
be
created
a
special
class
of
lessees.
and
by
enacting
this
permission
to
tax,
the
evidence
concerned
for
two
factors,
one,
that
this
class
of
lessees
would
not
be
favored,
notably
favored
over
their
local
brethren
or
classes
in
a
similar
position
or
in
the
same
economic
standpoint
or
in
a
--
in
a
position
of
economic
competition
with
those
lessees,
and
two,
the
evidences
are
concerned
that
that
lessees'
interest
created
under
the
military
leasing
act
should
bear
its
proportion
of
burden
of
taxation
in
the
various
states
and
should
pay
for
the
government
services
afforded
and
the
government
protections
afforded
to
these
lessees
in
the
exercise
of
their
interest.
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
sir.
i
am
resting
though,
not
completely
but
in
part
upon,
texas
acceptance
to
tax
that
interest.
in
doing
so,
they
evidence
similar
concerns.
first,
that
these
people
should
not
be
notably
favored
over
lessees
in
the
same
economic
position
or
similar
lessees,
lessees
of
similar
property.
now,
the
state
in
point
of
fact
does
not
have
any
similar
property.
it
does
not
lease
any
similar
property
and
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
that's
--
that's
why
i
thought
that
mr.
harlan's
question
was
defective,
your
honor,
because
it's
a
moot
abstract
question.
mr.
jack
n.
price
all
right.
mr.
jack
n.
price
assuming
that,
your
honor,
it
would
appear
to
me
just
at
first
blush
that
the
sole
discrimination
of
the
differentiation
would
be
on
the
basis
of
ownership,
ownership
alone.
and
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
a
sufficient
basis.
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
sir,
i
was
not
saying
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
n.
price
exactly
right.
now
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
that
is
so,
your
honor,
and
there
is
no
discrimination.
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes,
it
would.
it
might
and
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
--
this
court
knows
it
does
not
view
problems
in
abstract
but
i
would
say
and
i
would
go
only
to
appellant's
brief
to
answer
--
reply
brief
to
answer
that
question
and
say
that
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
the
state
of
texas
to
go
into
this
type
of
business
or
to
acquire
this
type
of
property
or
to
make
this
type
of
lease.
an
appellant
has
--
has
displayed
this
fact
far
better
than
we
could
ourselves,
your
honor,
but
we
did
ourselves
because
we
did
not
bother
to
trace
out
every
little
piece
of
statutory
authority
for
leasing.
and
when
you
examine
that
authority,
you
arrive
at
this
result
that
the
only
authorization
for
leasing
in
texas
is
leasing
of
this
--
of
the
property
of
the
state-supported
educational
institutions
and
leasing
a
property
where
the
lease,
you
see,
the
contemplated
or
authorized
is
by
way
of
some
sort
of
public
concession.
and
when
you
get
at
that
result,
you
--
you
bring
texas
in
direct
alignment
with
the
situation
under
public
law
189
of
michigan,
because
they
accepted,
those
types
of
property
from
the
operation
of
public
law
189.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
what
happens
then,
your
honor,
is
that
we
--
we
inevitably
have
another
case,
testing
it
for
the
same.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
that's
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
--
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
your
honor,
i'm
very
familiar
with
that
having
written
the
opinion
concerning
the
pantex
ordnance
works,
which
held
it
--
it
was
exempt
to
texas
tech.
but
actually,
you
have
to
look
at
that
thing.
the
--
and
--
the
federal
government
did
cede
the
pantex
ordnance
works
or
sell
to
pantex
ordnance
works
at
texas
tech.
they
sold
it
for
something
like
$1
an
acre
and
had
it
used
ordnance
works
there.
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
they
conditioned
the
selling
of
that
property
to
the
proposition
that
it'd
be
devoted
to
educational
use
plant.
then
under
the
deep
from
the
united
states
government
to
texas
tech,
had
texas
tech
actually
lease
that
ordnance
works,
the
property
would
have
gone
by
on
condition
subsequent
to
the
federal
government.
so
that
possibility
was
completely
if
you
read
this
opinion,
it
has
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
i'm
talking
about
the
ordnance
works
itself.
now,
what
was
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
sir.
the
pantex
ordnance
works.
there's
no
property
leased
under
that
pantex
ordnance
works
had
remained
derivative.
it's
owned
by
texas
tech
now
that
is
comparable
to
this
property
to
the
cactus
ordnance
works.
mr.
jack
n.
price
you
mean
the
cactus
ordnance
works,
what
is
it?
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
that
is
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
it
is
in
the
type
of
property,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
n.
price
it
is
in
the
type
of
property.
in
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
it
--
it's
their
interest
created
under
the
military
leasing
act,
these
lessees
of
huge
industrial
plants,
it
is
nothing
comparable.
the
state
has
no
such
--
it
is
never
have
--
it
--
the
texas
tech
for
six
months
had
entitle
to
an
ordnance
works
and
that
is
the
only
incidence
in
texas,
and
that
is
cited
outside
of
the
record
by
signing
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
it
had
that
for
six
months
and
then
it
was
recaptured
by
the
federal
government
but
had
they
leased
that
ordnance
works.
that
is
the
actual
industrial
plant.
mr.
jack
n.
price
it
would
have
reverted
to
the
federal
government
because
it
was
conditioned
on
being
used
pursuant
to
what
was
called
a
--
an
educational
use
plant.
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
sir.
it
leased
--
it
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
just
like
mr.
langley
said,
for
storage.
and
--
and
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
and
(voice

--
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
i
--
it's
just
in

in
the
justification
for
the
class
erected,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
n.
price
it
is
just
for

it

it
goes
to
the
justification
for
the
class
erected
and
that
is

class
erected
by
article
5248.
mr.

the
classification
erected
by
the
operation.
mr.
jack

price
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack

and
that
is
lessees
of
these
huge
industrial
plants.
mr.
jack

and

and
point
of
fact,
the
federal
--
mr.
jack

that's
right.
mr.
jack

i
said
if
they
did.
mr.
jack

that
is
one
of
the
facts.
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
that
--
that
is
not
a
--
a
plant,
your
honor.
that
is
just
a
mere,
a
few
scattered
storage
houses
and
plus
a
few
scattered
grazing
acres
which
the
state
leases
at
all
times
under
its
property
that's
held
in
the
public
school
fund.
the
purpose
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is.
that
industrial
plant,
the
--
the
persons
who
--
who
worked
there,
who
use
the
government
roads,
who
send
their
children
to
the
texas
schools,
have
much
more
of
an
impact
upon
the
economy
of
the
taxing
authorities
within
which
they're
located,
then
a
few
cows
on
the
grazing
lease
aren't
here
or
the
fact
that
there's
a
--
mr.
jack

price
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
really
don't
know.
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
jack
n.
price
that
--
that
question
is
not
--
that
question
is
--
is
open
actually
because
of
the
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
you
look
at
the
history
of
it,
you
could
say
it's
very
well
open
because
you
could
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
that's
--
that's
exactly
right
because
the
history
of
it,
evidence
is
the
intention
of
the
legislature
only
to
take
advantage
of
the
taxation
permission
granted
by
the
federal
government,
the
military
leasing
act.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
between
the
industrial
and
--
and
the
other
commercial
uses?
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
your
honor,
not
in
this
connection.
this
court
has
--
has
found
this
more
than
a
sufficient
basis
to
distinguish
property
and
to
distinguish
excises
and
uses
and
privileges.
in
one
case,
the
(inaudible)
case,
this
court
found
a
distinction
between
colored
oleo
and
white
oleo
is
sufficient
to
base
a
classification
for
taxation
purposes.
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
n.
price
the
basis
was
this,
your
honor.
just
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
the
state,
a
state
institution,
and
the
texas
tech
is
such
an
institution,
may
lease
its
property
provided
that
the
leasing
is
temporary
that
all
revenues
from
that
leasing
are
tp
the
state
benefit
and
that
the
public
purposes
is
not
abandoned,
and
if
you
read
this
opinion,
it
is
conditioned
upon
those
three
conditions
just
as
every
case
that,
and
there
are
only
about
three
of
them
that
he
has
cited
where
there
are
other
similar
to
this,
have
also
been
similarly
conditioned.
mr.
jack
n.
price
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that
i
really
don't
know,
your
honor,
because
it
has
not
been
cited.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
your
honor,
that
goes
--
that
--
that's
viewing
it
from
--
from
one
side
of
the
question.
this
classification
question
can
actually
be
viewed
from
two
standpoints.
one,
is
there
any
justification
for
segregating
the
class
of
federal
lessees?
two,
is
there
any
justification
for
distinguishing
or
differentiating
the
treatment
of
state
lessees?
now,
this
--
this
second
question
is
interesting
also,
and
we
actually
believe
that
you
can't
find
that
justification.
in
this
fact,
when
the
state
leases
its
own
property,
it
can
equate
the
actual
economic
burden
upon
that
property
with
the
tax
burden
upon
federal
lessees
or
lessees
of
other
exempt
property
by
setting
the
lease
facts.
in
other
words,
the
state
gets
the
market
value
for
its
lease.
and
this
market
value,
as
far
as
the
state
lease
is
concerned,
is
going
to
be
directly
affected
by
the
absence
of
taxes
on
that
lease.
in
other
words,
an
actual
effect
that
money
that
the
state
gets
from
the
lease
is
the
same
that
it
would
get
or
gets
in
a
form
of
taxes
from
another
lease
where
it
does
not
have
a
control
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
--
and
certainly
has
no
such
control
over
such
property.
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
jack
n.
price
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
n.
price
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
rent
is
just
as
much
revenue
to
the
state
as
our
taxes.
there
is
no
distinction
between
them.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
that's
just
a
question
that
--
that
i
--
i
could
not
answer
to
mr.
frankfurter
because
that
would
involve
another
construction
of
the
statute
and
that
would
be
whether
it
--
it
actually
was
intended
to
apply
to
more
than
this
class
of
industrial
lessees
erected
by
the
military
leasing
act.
i
think
there
is
a
genuine
question.
i
think
you
only
have
to
remove
one
question
and
that
is
this
history
of
the
act
falling
from
the
heels
as
it
did
of
the
passage
of
the
military
leasing
act.
if
you
remove
that,
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
that
--
that
it
would
be
leased
and
--
and
it
would
be
taxed
and
have
the
federal
government
under
article
5248
but
there
is
a
genuine
question
there.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
n.
price
i
--
i
think
i
have
made
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
i
did
not
make
it
clear.
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
it's
not
in
my
--
it's
not
in
my
brief
but
it's
all
through
mr.
langley's
brief.
mr.
jack
n.
price
i
--
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
my
oral
argument.
mr.
jack
n.
price
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
it
--
it's
actually
just
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
--
it's
just
scattered
out
through
there
where
he
--
where
he
says
that
right
in
his
initial
proposition
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
sir,
there's
not.
there's
evidence
as
to
what
the
lease
price
is.
there
was
a
million
20
--
$266,666
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
sir.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
can
infer
that.
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
but
if
--
if
you
wanted
--
if
you
want
to
pursue
that
evidence,
i
think
you
could
say
that
because
it
--
mr.
jack
n.
price
no,
sir,
we
did
not
view
that
as
our
burden.
we
have
viewed
an
affirmative
burden
to
prove
discrimination
upon
--
on
the
appellant.
but
--
but
actually
the
record
shows
that
this
lease
price
is
about
2.5%
of
the
actual
value
of
that
cactus
ordnance
works
which
was
leased.
now,
any
landlord
know
just
an
economic
price
that
you
have
to
get
to
retire
your
investment,
1%
per
month,
which
is
12%
per
year,
tax
they
make
a
profit
any
realization
whatsoever
into
--
to
retire
your
capital
investment.
so
obviously,
this
is
pretty
low
as
far
as
the
actual
capital
investment
of
the
government
is
concerned.
it's
pretty
obvious
that
any
other
lessee
of
comparable
property
in
texas,
if
there
is,
i
mean,
it
has
not
been
shown.
mr.
jack
n.
price
it's
an
economic
principle,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
n.
price
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
really
would
not
know.
i'd
say
this
that
if
it's
not
it's
a
mighty
poor
land.
mr.
jack
n.
price
that's
--
that's
possibly
true.
that's
possibly
true,
your
honor.
