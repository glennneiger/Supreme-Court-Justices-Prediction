what
subject
was
that
aimed
to
refer
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
cities?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
many
like
that
in
texas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
which
one
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
asking
if
you
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
those
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
you
wrote
an
opinion
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
basis
on
which
you
distinguished
and
upheld
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
defend
that
all
your
tax
on
the
ground
that
the
government
charges
so
little
for
its
lease
places
that
state
owners
who
have
leased
in
other
ways
had
a
disadvantage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
asking
you
to
make
an
argument.
i'm
asking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you
have
made
an
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
in
his
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
in
his
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it
in
his
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
--
any
evidence
or
anything
in
connection
with
the
price
of
the
government
lease
as
compared
to
the
price
of
leases
that
other
operators
have
to
pay
in
the
state
of
texas
where
they
do
not
lease
from
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
that's
the
point
i
ask
about
it
and
asked
if
you'd
argue
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
unless
it's
also
shown
that
by
reason
of
that
price
being
so
low
which
the
government
gives
on
its
places,
the
other
leaseholders
in
the
state
of
texas
are
at
a
disadvantage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
it
would
be
a
justification
for
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
don't
care
to
pursue
it.
i'm
asking
if
you
have
pursued
it
if
you
have
anything
in
the
record
that
does
pursue
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we
couldn't
take
judicial
knowledge
of
that,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
amicus
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
argument
go
to
this
extent
that
anything
that
federal
government
sell.
now,
this
is
--
i
understand
your
point
that
for
this
is
own
federal
property.
but,
let's
assume
it's
owned
property
that
the
federal
government
has
sold
out
of
it's
hand
and
no
longer
have
it.
suppose
the
state
should
decide
that
it
wanted
to
have
a
law
that
any
property
that
has
been
formerly
owned
by
the
federal
government
should
bear
one
tax,
the
property
owned
by
--
formerly
owned
by
other
people
that
should
bear
another
tax.
is
that
--
do
you
go
that
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
it
wouldn't
be
good
or
it
would,
i'm
just
asking
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
should
pass
a
law
that
any
grocery
company
buying
from
other
companies,
wholesalers
or
distributors
that
had
a
capital
stock
of
more
than
$100
million
should
be
taxed
at
one
amount
and
those
who
bought
groceries
from
someone
else
would
be
taxed
for
the
smaller
amount.
would
that
in
judgement
be
anything
like
the
kind
of
discrimination
which
what
exists
here
if
the
state
is
really
taxing
something
that
the
lessee
owns?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
this
morning,
to
go
further
in
that
the
--
this
court
(inaudible)
further
than
that
a
number
of
time
and
said
if
a
reasonable
ground
to
be
attributed,
as
i
recall
it's
what
you
--
reasonable
ground
could
be
attributed
to
support
it,
it
would
have
to
be
attributed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
--
getting
at
there,
i'm
not
sure
whether
this
part
is
good
on
one
side
or
good
on
the
other
or
bad
on
both.
what
difference
does
it
make
if
property
is
owned
by
the
people
in
a
state
of
whom
they
purchased
it
as
to
the
ability
of
the
state
to
tax
and
to
levy
specification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
in
effect
that
the
immunity
would
pass
on
after
the
sale
of
the
goods
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
ways.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
tax
was
--
will
then
be
levied
on
it
on
the
basis
that
it
had
been
bought
from
the
government
would
be
different
to
tax
laid
on
the
property
that
had
not
been
bought
from
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
it
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
gets
very
much
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
what
you
have
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
position
of
your
case.
