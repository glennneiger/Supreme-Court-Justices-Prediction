mr.
davis,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
langley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
price
maybe
admitted
for
that
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
state
of
texas
--
if
the
state
of
texas
leased
its
--
its
property
to
a
corporation
in
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here,
would
that
property
be
taxed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
it
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
it
was
a
--
suppose
it
was
a
privately
endowed
college?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
--
the
rent
was
used
for
--
for
school
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
taxed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
price.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
price,
let
--
let's
bring
it
down
a
little
closer
to
today.
as
i
understood
mr.
langley,
the
--
the
state
does
own
some
property
that
it
acquired
from
the
government
by
gift
and
that
it
did
lease
that
property
to
phillips
for
storage
purposes.
i
suppose
it's
a
--
it's
a
warehouse.
now,
as
i
understood
him,
that
property
is
not
taxable
under
texas
law.
what
is
the
distinction
between
that
piece
of
property
and
this
piece
of
property
if
they
have
the
same
kind
of
--
of
leases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
piece
--
what
piece
of
property
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
in
this
case,
is
this
property
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
the
piece
of
property
that
mr.
langley
is
talking
about
and
this
piece
of
property
referring
to
the
--
to
the
one
that
is
also
leased
to
phillips
for
storage
purposes?
i
suppose,
it's
a
big
warehouse
or
something
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
i'm
--
i
--
but
he
mentioned
that
--
that
there
was
another
piece
of
property
that
the
state
did
own
and
that
it
leased
to
the
same
concern,
to
the
phillips
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
he
says
that
that
--
that
that
lease
is
not
taxable.
now,
what
is
the
distinction
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
between
--
between
that
--
that
situation
and
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
what
distinction
and
type
of
property
meant
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
it
kept
a
part
of
the
property
and
it
leased
it
and
it
leased
it
to
phillips
and
i
suppose
it
didn't
lease
it
to
phillips
for
educational
purposes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
leased
it
to
it
for
commercial
purposes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
that
commercial
--
private
purpose,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
is
the
difference
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
is
the
difference
between
that
transaction
and
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
class
erected?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
has
the
--
have
your
courts
made
any
distinction
between
these
two
classes
of
property
that
you
and
i
have
been
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
let
me
ask
you
this
question
as
to
this
piece
of
property
that'being
used
--
leased
to
phillips
for
storage
purposes
now,
if
that
belong
to
the
federal
government
at
the
present
time,
it
was
leased
by
the
federal
government,
would
it
come
under
this
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
sir.
mr.
clifford.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
has
been
no
texas
decision
specifying
that
this
supplies
only
to
one
class
of
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
did
not
oppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page?
