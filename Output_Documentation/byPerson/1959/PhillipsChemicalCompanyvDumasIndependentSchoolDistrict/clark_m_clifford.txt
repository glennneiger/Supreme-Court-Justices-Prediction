mr.
clark
m.
clifford
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
phillips
chemical
company,
the
appellant
in
this
court.
the
respondent
or
appellee
is
the
dumas
independent
school
district
in
texas.
the
federal
government
has
intervened
us
amicus
curiae
as
has
the
state
of
texas.
in
1950,
the
state
legislature
in
texas
passed
a
law
having
to
do
with
the
taxing
of
lessees
of
federal
property.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
construed
that
law
as
permitting
the
dumas
independent
school
district
to
asses
a
tax
against
phillips
chemical
company
on
federal
property
which
it
leased
and
based
that
tax
on
the
full
fee
value
of
the
property.
the
phillips
chemical
company
below
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
it
was
sustained
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
this
appeal
follows
to
this
court.
the
facts
are
simple
and
undisputed.
during
world
war
ii,
the
federal
government
built
an
ordnance
plant
in
moore
county,
texas
and
called
it
the
cactus
ordnance
works.
it
operated
during
the
war
and
made
explosives
there.
after
the
war
was
over,
the
government
did
not
wish
to
sell
the
plant,
they
wanted
to
keep
it
in
the
ownership
of
the
federal
government
in
the
event
that
at
some
future
time
they
might
wish
to
use
it
again.
so
they
leased
the
plant.
and
in
1948,
the
federal
government,
which
owned
the
fee
of
the
plant,
leased
the
plant
to
phillips
chemical
company
for
a
primary
period
of
15
years
with
right
of
renewal.
the
rental
on
the
plant
was
in
excess
of
$1
million
per
year.
also,
the
government
can
cancel
the
lease
at
anytime
that
it
chooses
on
giving
90
days
notice.
if
it
desires
to
sell
the
plant,
the
government
can
also
cancel
a
lease
on
30
days
notice
in
the
event
of
a
national
emergency.
now
in
1950,
the
legislature
of
texas
passed
a
law
that
united
states
property
would
be
subject
to
taxation
if
used
by
a
private
party
in
its
business.
now
from
1950
to
1954,
nothing
occurred.
everybody
went
along
in
their
usual
manner.
but
in
1954,
the
school
district,
i'll
refer
to
it
as
that,
levied
a
tax
against
phillips
based
on
the
full
fee
value
of
the
cactus
ordnance
works.
phillips
was
operating
the
plant
as
an
anhydrous
ammonia
plant
which,
as
your
honors
know,
is
used
in
commercial
fertilizer.
now
after
the
assessor
assessed
that
tax
against
phillips
based
on
the
full
fee
value
of
the
plant,
phillips
filed
suit
in
the
state
court
in
texas
to
have
the
assessment
cancelled
and
to
enjoin
the
collector
from
collecting
the
tax.
the
lower
court
denied
relief
as
did
the
intermediate
court
of
civil
appeals.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
we
do
not
know,
your
honor.
no
explanation
appears
to
that
--
of
that,
as
far
as
i
know
none
appears
in
the
record.
the
case
then
after
going
from
the
court
of
civil
appeals
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
there
the
validity
of
the
statute
was
upheld,
but
at
that
time,
out
of
the
nine
judges
of
that
court,
four
dissented
strenuously
and
they
dissented
on
the
ground
that
this
statute
was
flagrantly,
grossly
discriminatory
insofar
as
the
federal
government
and
its
lessees
are
concerned.
now
below
briefly
the
contentions
of
phillips
phillips
showed
in
the
trial
below
that
lessees
of
non
federal
exempt
property
paid
no
tax
at
all
if
the
lease
was
for
under
three
years.
and
they
paid
the
tax
based
only
on
the
leasehold
if
the
term
of
the
lease
was
for
more
than
three
years.
so
phillips
said
in
view
of
what
the
other
lessees
of
tax-exempt
property
were
--
were
subjected
to
in
texas
that
it
was
invalid
and
unconstitutional
for
the
legislature
to
select
just
the
lessees
of
federal
property
and
subject
them
to
a
tax
based
on
the
full
fee
value
of
the
property
which
they
were
leasing.
we
present
but
two
questions
here.
one,
the
1950
texas
law
is
invalid
for
it
is
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
it
discriminates
against
the
united
states
and
those
with
whom
it
deals.
it
imposes
a
burden
on
the
activities
of
the
federal
government
and
infringes
upon
its
sovereignty.
it
also
violates
the
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
our
first
point.
our
second
point
is
the
law
is
invalid
for
it
imposes
an
ad
valorem
tax
upon
the
federal
property
and
interferes
with
the
sovereign
right
of
the
government
over
its
property
in
texas.
now
the
argument
if
you
please
and
i
address
myself
solely
to
the
point
number
one.
simply
point
number
one
is
the
tax
is
discriminatory.
now
we
must
refer,
if
your
honors
will
please,
to
the
statute
in
question
or
it
will
be
referred
to
a
good
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
i
refer
you
to
page
12
of
the
appellant's
brief.
briefly
it
will
be
noted,
it
says
in
substance
to
this.
“the
united
states
shall
be
secure
in
their
possession
and
enjoyment
of
all
lands
acquired
under
the
provisions
of
this
type,
and
such
lands
and
all
improvements
thereon
should
be
exempt
from
any
taxation
under
the
authority
of
the
state
so
long
as
the
same
are
held,
owned,
used,
and
occupied
by
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
expressed
in
this
title
and
not
otherwise.”
let
me
stop
and
say
that
down
to
this
point
that
had
been
in
the
law
of
texas
for
many
years.
but
in
1950,
the
legislature
of
texas
amended
it
to
add
the
following
language
which
appears
in
--
on
the
page
12.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes
sir.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes
sir.
provided
further
that
any
portion
of
said
lands
and
improvements
which
is
use
and
occupied
by
any
person,
firm,
and
association
of
persons
or
corporation
in
its
private
capacity
or
which
is
being
used
or
occupied
in
the
conduct
of
any
private
business
or
enterprise
shall
be
subjected
to
taxation
by
this
state
and
its
political
subdivisions.
it
will
be
noted
that
the
language
of
the
statute
refers
only
to
the
united
states
and
refers
only
to
the
lessees.
it
says
“occupiers.”
i'll
use
the
term
lessee
because
they're
practically
all
on
leases.
this
statute
points
directly
and
unequivocally
to
the
united
states
and
its
lessees
and
points
to
no
one
else.
now
if
you
are
to
understand
the
degree
of
the
discrimination,
it
is
important
that
you
be
familiar
with
the
existence
--
with
the
law
that
existed
in
texas
before
the
statute
was
passed
in
1950.
there
were
but
two
sections
that
texas
law
that
had
to
do
with
lessees
of
tax-exempt
property.
7173,
which
said,
that
lessees
of
tax-exempt
property,
if
their
term
is
for
less
than
three
years,
they
pay
no
tax
on
the
tax-exempt
property,
and
7174,
which
in
effect
says,
“if
the
lease
of
tax-exempt
property
is
for
more
than
three
years,
then
the
lessee
shall
pay
a
tax
based
only
on
the
value
of
the
leasehold,”
not
on
the
value-to-be,
only
on
the
value
of
the
leasehold,
another
important
element.
many
years
ago,
the
texas
supreme
court
construed
those
statutes
to
mean
also
that
if
a
lease
had
in
it
a
cancellation
clause
which
permitted
the
lessor
to
cancel
at
his
discretion,
then
it
would
be
considered
to
be
a
lease
for
under
three
years,
no
matter
what
the
term
might
be.
so
if
the
lessor
could
cancel
it
anytime,
obviously,
it
is
not
a
definite
obligation
of
three
years
or
more.
so
here
is
the
picture
that
existed
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
law.
here
is
a
large
classification
of
tax-exempt
lessees.
it
included
all
lessees
of
tax-exempt
property,
lessees
of
federal
property,
state,
county,
municipal,
irrigation
districts,
every
lessee
of
tax-exempt
property
was
included
in
this
great
large
classification
and
that
had
existed
for
70
years.
so
what
the
legislature
did
in
1950
was
just
carve
into
this
long-term
classification
of
lessees,
they
carved
into
that
and
extracted
from
it
just
the
lessees
of
federal
property.
and
so
the
court
said,
what
then
happens
to
the
lessees
of
federal
property
now
that
they've
been
carved
out
of
this
classification.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
held
that
with
a
federal
lessee,
if
his
term
of
lease
is
less
than
three
years,
he
pays
a
tax
based
on
the
full
value
of
the
fee,
whereas
back
in
the
old
classification,
all
other
lessees
of
tax-exempt
property
paid
no
tax
at
all
if
the
lease
was
for
less
than
three
years.
over
here,
if
a
lessee
of
federal
property
had
a
term
of
more
than
three
years,
it
made
no
difference
to
him,
he
still
pay
the
tax
base
on
the
full
value
of
the
fee,
while
over
in
the
old
classification,
lessees
of
other
tax-exempt
property
in
excess
of
three
years,
they
paid
a
tax
only
based
on
the
value
of
the
leasehold
and
not
on
the
value
of
the
fee.
so
that
when
that
was
made
clear
as
it
was
below,
four
of
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
said,
“this
appears
to
be
a
very
definite,
direct
discrimination
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
its
lessees,
and
they
so
dissented
claiming
that
it
was
repugnant
to
the
constitution
and
we
submit
repugnant
to
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
i
believe
the
question
enters
one's
mind,
that
if
it
appears
so
clear
as
it
does
that
the
legislature
just
took
one
specific
group
and
assessed
this
very
substantial
tax.
for
instance,
phillips
chemical
company
leased
this
plant,
this
plant
was
valued
at
a
very
large
sum.
yet
the
assessor
says,
“although
you
just
--
you
have
a
lease
and
the
government
can
cancel
that
lease
anytime,
yet
you've
got
to
pay
a
tax
based
on
the
full
fee
value
of
that
property.”
and
phillips
says,
“how
about
all
these
fellows
that
we
used
to
be
with
over
here
and
they
don't
pay
any
tax?”
“we
don't
care.
this
is
a
law
that
the
legislature
passed
in
1950.”
now,
the
judges
below,
the
five
who
sustained
the
validity,
how
were
they
able
to
overcome
this
direct
and
unequivocal
discrimination?
well
there
were
some
three
or
four
bases
that
they
offered.
now
the
one
that
they
seem
to
attach
the
most
importance
to
was,
they
said,
why
this
tax,
that
this
statute
in
1950,
is
constitutional,
because
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
ruled
that
this
kind
of
statute
is
constitutional.
and
they
said,
“all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
case
of
borg-warner.
borg-warner,
your
honors
will
recall,
is
one
of
the
three
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
the
1937
term,
and
it
was
the
borg-warner
case,
the
continental
motors
case,
and
the
murray
corporation
case.
and
in
those
cases
or
the
first,
the
borg-warner,
is
the
one
they
depend
on
mostly
because
it
is
closest
in
perhaps
facts
to
this.
in
the
borg-warner
case,
michigan
passed
a
statute
and
that
statute
required
a
lessee
of
property
and
a
lessee
of
federal
property
to
pay
a
tax
based
on
the
full
value
of
the
property
that
it
leased
from
the
government.
therefore,
these
five
gentlemen
in
texas,
they
see
there,
in
the
borg-warner
case,
the
supreme
court
said,
“a
state
passes
a
statute.
it
permits
that
state
to
level
a
tax
against
the
lessee
of
federal
property
and
it
permits
us
to
level
the
tax
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
property
which
the
lessee
got
from
the
government.”
now
what
--
i
submit
--
what
they
failed
to
consider
or
what
they
chose
to
disregard
was
the
fact
that
in
those
cases
and
in
the
--
particularly
the
borg-warner
which
was
the
first
of
the
three
cases
and
the
lead
of
the
three
cases,
this
court
held
very
clearly
that
such
tax
as
it
approved
in
--
in
that
borg-warner
case,
the
michigan
statute,
that
that
tax
was
approved
only
on
the
basis
that
it
was
nondiscriminatory.
that
it
applied
to
all
lessees
of
all
tax-exempt
property
and
didn't
single
any
particular
group
of
lessees
out.
for
instance
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
we
show
where
the
majority
of
the
court
below
said,
“the
borg-warner
case
clearly
upholds
the
validity
of
the
taxes
assessed
by
the
school
district
against
phillips
insofar
as
the
federal
constitution
and
the
laws
are
concerned.
but
the
difference
between
the
michigan
statute
and
the
texas
statute
seems
to
me
that
they
immediately
revealed
upon
reading.
the
texas
statute
says,
“lessees
of
federal
property
shall
pay
this
tax
based
on
the
value
of
the
fee.”
whereas,
the
michigan
statute
said,
“all
lessees
of
any
types
of
tax-exempt
property
shall
pay
a
use
tax
they
call
it
upon
the
use
of
the
property
and
engaging
the
amount
of
the
tax,
you
may
base
it
upon
the
value
of
the
property
which
they
have.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes
sir.
they
–
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
oh
i
think
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
i
thought
--
one
i'd
say,
of
course,
it
was
not
found
as
a
fact;
second,
this
doesn't
say,
“just
large”
--
the
statute
in
texas
just
doesn't
say
large
ordnance
plants.
it
says,
“any
property
that
the
federal
government
has
in
texas
and
is
leased
to
private
parties
for
their
business,
any
kind
of
property.”
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well
they
--
they
couldn't
take
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
oh
they
couldn't
take
judicial
notice
of
that
your
honor
because
it
doesn't
happen
to
be
the
fact,
because
the
--
the
federal
government
in
texas
may
own
warehouses
for
instance.
the
state
of
texas
may
own
warehouses.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
reply
brief
of
the
appellant
shows
that
50
miles
away
from
this
plant,
the
cactus
plant,
is
another
plant
called
the
pantex,
panhandle
texas,
pantex
plant.
it
was
formerly
owned
by
the
federal
government
but
when
the
war
was
over,
they
beaded
about
half
of
that
plant
and
the
surrounding
material
to
the
state
of
texas,
and
the
state
of
texas
owns
a
large
part
of
that
plant
and
a
large
part
of
buildings
belonging
to
that
plant
and
they
rent
those
buildings
out
on
leases
to
private
individuals
and
they
get
the
money
from
them
and
the
individuals
don't
pay
any
tax
on
it.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well
no,
it
isn't
the
question
that
texas
doesn't
tax
itself.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
they're
owner.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
they're
owner.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
the
federal
government
gave
them
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
--
gave
them
to
the
state
of
texas,
there
were
some
adjustments
of
credit
and
a
federal
government
gave
the
property
to
texas
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no,
texas
owns
the
fee
of
--
of
these
--
of
these
commercial
dwellings.
they
lease
them
out
to
individual
businesses
and
get
the
rent
from
them,
just
as
the
federal
government
does,
and
yet
those
people
don't
pay
any
tax
and
yet
lessees
of
federal
government
pay
a
tax.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well,
i
--
i'm
just
saying
that
that
texas
cannot
discriminate
against
the
federal
government
and
impugn
the
sovereignty
of
the
federal
government
and
they
cannot
pass
a
law,
in
my
opinion
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
--
of
the
authorities
here,
that
hold
that
the
federal
government
will
be
discriminated
against
in
this
manner.
now
on
that
point,
if
i
might
carry
it
further.
in
the
borg-warner
case,
after
they
discussed
the
fact
that
the
michigan
statute
permitted
this
tax,
mr.
justice
black,
in
speaking
for
the
court
said,
“it
still
remains
true
as
it
has
from
the
beginning
that
a
tax
maybe
invalid,
even
though
it
does
not
fall
directly
on
the
united
states
if
it
operates
so
as
to
discriminate
against
the
government
or
those
with
whom
it
deals.”
they
found
however,
in
that
michigan
case
that
the
tax
there,
the
statute
of
michigan,
did
not
discriminate
against
the
government
or
those
with
whom
it
deals.
then
again
in
the
borg-warner
case,
the
michigan
statute
under
attack
subjected
to
taxation
every
private
party
who
uses
exempt
property
in
michigan
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
private
gain.
that's
what
they've
found
there.
that
under
the
michigan
statute,
every
private
property
who
uses
exempt
property
in
michigan
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
private
gain
is
covered
by
the
michigan
statute.
and
in
addition,
the
court
observes
still
speaking
through
mr.
justice
black,
there
was
no
showing
that
the
tax
is,
in
fact,
administered
to
discriminate
against
those
using
federal
property.
to
the
contrary,
undisputed
evidence
introduced
by
appellees
demonstrates
that
lessees
of
other
exempt
property
have
also
been
taxed.”
here
they
held
in
the
--
that
this
court
held
in
the
michigan
case
that
the
record
shows
that
all
lessees
of
tax-exempt
property
were
subject
to
this
tax
and
that
the
federal
government
had
not
been
discriminated
against.
so
they
said,
“all
right”,
you
gentlemen
said,
“we
will
uphold
that
tax.”
i
suggest
here
that
the
absolute
contrary
is
so.
now
certain
other
language
of
that
gets
maybe
even
a
little
closer.
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
his
separate
opinion,
expressed
the
same
view
in
a
separate
opinion.
he
said,
“the
state
taxes
here,”
that's
the
michigan
tax,
“do
not
operate
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
by
so
measuring
the
tax
or
use
on
activities
so
as
to
impose
an
unequal
tax
burden
on
lessees
or
users
of
government
property,
vis-à-vis
lessees,
users,
or
owners
of
other
tax-exempt
or
non-exempt
property.
so
it
was
–
it
was
in
the
minds
of
this
court
at
the
time
that
this
michigan
tax
must
be
studied
carefully
to
see
if
it
imposed
an
unequal
tax
burden
on
lessees
of
government
property,
vis-à-vis,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
says,
“lessees,
users,
or
owners
of
other
tax-exempt
property.”
and
the
specific
affirmative
finding
in
that
case
was
that
the
tax
was
not
discriminatory
because
it
fell
upon
this
large
group
that
i
just
spoke
about,
that
is
lessees
of
all
types
of
tax-exempt
property.
they
found
that
it
did
in
the
michigan
case.
i
submit
that
in
texas,
when
you
carve
out
the
one
group,
lessees
of
federal
property
and
you
put
them
over
there,
and
then
say,
this
group
can
be
taxed
on
the
full
fee
value
of
the
property
on
the
authority
of
the
borg-warner
case,
i
submit
that
it's
perhaps
that
the
case
just
wasn't
studied
to
the
extent
that
it
might
have
been
studied.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
if
there
is
a
type
of
discrimination
that
is
obvious,
it's
direct
and
it
places
the
federal
government
and
its
lessee
at
a
disadvantage
as
this
obviously
does,
then
i
say
to
you
that
this
statute
falls,
this
statute
should
be
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
all
right.
that
if
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
oh
yes.
yes
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well
that's
right.
now,
as
i
mentioned
before,
when
this
discrimination
is
as
apparent
as
it
is
here,
it
makes
you
wonder
what
were
the
bases
of
the
holding
of
the
majority
below.
we
know
why
the
four
dissented.
they
said
specifically
because
of
discrimination
against
the
federal
government.
but
how
did
the
five
happened
to
hold
that
this
was
constitutional?
now
i
have
just
given
one
that
that
is
the
first
point
that
i
wanted
to
cover.
the
five
judges
below
said,
“we
place
our
decision,
one
of
the
reasons,
because
the
borg-warner
case
decided
by
this
court
clearly
upholds
the
validity
of
the
taxes
assessed
by
the
school
district.”
now
there
were
some
three
or
four
other
reasons.
mr.
justice
harlan,
one
was,
the
one
that
you
mentioned
that
the
state
says,
“this
is
a
proper
action
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
create
a
new
classification.
there
has
been,
in
effect,
this
old
classification
of
all
of
them.
we
now
create
a
new
classification
by
carving
out
just
the
lessees
of
federal
property
and
we
will
show
that
we
can
justify
this
new
classification."
i
will
not,
if
the
court
agrees,
i
will
not,
at
this
time,
give
further
attention
to
that
for
the
reason
that
by
agreement
between
counsel,
myself,
and
the
solicitor
general's
office,
they're
going
to
take
that
particular
issue
and
discuss
it
fully.
that's
one
in
which
they
have
a
very
vital
interest
when
the
lessees
of
federal
government
are
just
carved
out
and
it
is
said
in
the
state
that
that
in
itself
can
constitute
a
new
classification.
another
point
that
the
judges
below
said
sustain
their
position
was
a
1947
statute,
which
said
that
lessees
of
plants,
such
as
this
and
other
government
property,
would
be
subjected
to
state
taxes.
that
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
sir.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no.
no,
that
was
in
1947
your
honor.
that
was
the
national
military
leasing
act
that
provided
for
the
leasing
of
these
war
plants
and
other
types
of
property.
counsel
for
the
government
also
desires
to
take
over
that
one
because
they
–
they
feel
strongly
about
that.
there
--
there
was
--
there
is
another
argument
they
--
they
make
below
for
justifying
this
particular
classification,
he
will
also
take
that
one
over,
so
that
we
won't
be
repetitive
insofar
as
your
honors
are
concerned.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
that
is
correct.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
if
the
term
of
the
lease
is
in
excess
of
three
years
that
second
equation
comes
into
being.
now
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
none.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well
i
--
i
would
answer
by
saying
this.
i
think
that
our
adversary
concedes
that
there
is
discrimination
in
the
case
but
they
attempt
to
justify
the
discrimination.
i
--
i
believe
there's
no
quarrel
to
take
this
equation.
if
a
lease
by
the
state
to
a
private
party
is
for
less
than
three
years,
that
lessee
pays
no
tax.
if
the
state
leases
property
in
excess
of
three
years,
that
lessee
pays
a
tax
only
on
the
value
of
the
leasehold.
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
either
one
of
those
situations,
if
it
involves
a
lessee
of
federal
property,
the
lessee
of
federal
property
pays
a
flat
tax
based
on
the
full
value
of
the
fee
no
matter
what
the
length
of
the
term
of
the
lease.
and
there's
where
we
say
is
the
--
is
the
flagrant
evidence
of
discrimination,
because
just
before
i
leave
that
point,
the
texas
legislature
could
have
done
the
same
thing
that
the
michigan
legislature
did.
the
michigan
legislature
passed
a
law,
this
was
in
1953,
which
said,
“all
lessees
of
all
types
of
tax-exempt
property”,
that's
a
general
language,
“shall
pay
a
tax
all
the
use
tax
based
upon
the
value
of
the
property.”
now
the
texas
legislature
could
have
done
that.
they
chose
not
to.
they
only
chose
to
direct
this
tax
against
lessees
of
federal
property.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes
sir.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
i
claim
that
it
is
under
the
second
point
that
is,
that
it's
a
tax
against
the
federal
land.
the
--
that
point
was
raised
below.
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
in
texas
held
it
was
not.
we
argued
strenuously
below
that
this
imposed
a
tax
upon
federal
property.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well,
that's
what
we
contended
at
that
time.
that
is
counsel
who
tried
it
below,
but
the
court
says
no.
the
court
in
--
construes
that
to
mean
that
it
just
means
that
if
a
private
party
is
in
possession
of
some
federal
property,
then
we're
going
to
assess
a
tax
and
the
private
party
is
the
one
that
we're
going
to
help
with
the
tax.
that's
the
way
they
construed
it,
your
honor.
now
i've
just
about
reached
our
second
point
which
you'll
remember
i
said
was
that
the
law
poses,
this
law
imposes
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
federal
property.
i
have
now
left
the
discrimination
point
now
i
get
to
--
i
get
to
this
next
point.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it's
bad
under
allegheny,
if
your
honor
please.
that's
right.
and
it's
bad
under
allegheny,
even
after
what
your
honors
did
to
allegheny
in
the
--
in
the
michigan
cases.
it's
still
bad
under
allegheny.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no.
(laughs)
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes.
and
it
not
only
seems
to
be,
your
honor,
it
is.
and
--
and
the
–
and
the
--
our
adversaries
do
not
disagree.
they
say
it
is
an
ad
valorem
tax.
now
i'd
always
been
led
to
believe
that
an
ad
valorem
tax
attached
to
property
and
was
based
upon
the
value
of
the
property.
and
that's
why
you
called
it
an
ad
valorem
tax.
but
when
the
court
got
hold
of
this,
they
said
in
effect,
“yes,
this
is
an
ad
valorem
tax.
but
we're
go
--
we're
going
to
construe
it
as
being
not
attached
on
federal
property,
because
we're
going
conceive
of
the
fact
and
assume
that
the
legislature
knew
they
couldn't
tax
federal
property
so
we'll
take
--
they
weren't
going
to
do
a
useless
act.
so,
yes,
we're
going
to
say
it's
an
ad
valorem
tax,
but
we're
going
to
direct
it
against
the
lessee
of
the
federal
property
and
all
the
ad
valorem
means
is
we're
going
to
base
that
lessee's
tax
upon
the
value
of
the
whole
fee.”
that's
finally
the
way
it
seems
to
me
that
they
get
to.
now
i
--
i'd
like
again
just
to
point
out
what
bothered
you
mr.
justice
whittaker.
if
--
if
your
honors
will
look
at
that
language
in
the
end
of
this
statute,
it
says
that
just
in
the
--
in
the
part
that's
in
a
different
print,
“provided
further
that
any
portion
of
said
land
that
remains
--
refers
only
to
federal
lands,
that
if
some
portion
of
said
land”,
it's
in
this
instance
is
the
whole
plant,
“and
if
that
land
is
occupied,
used
or
occupied,
in
the
conduct
of
any
private
business
or
enterprise,
it”
i'm
supplying
“it”
but
“it”
is
the
lands,
“it
shall
be
subject
to
taxation
by
the
state
and
its
political
subdivision.”
the
subject
of
this
sentence
is
“portion
of
said
land
shall
be
subject
to
taxation
by
the
state.”
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well
the
court
construed
it
the
other
way.
that's
right.
but
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well
–
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
all
right.
now
there
are
some
other
factors.
first
place,
which
we
just
submit,
the
language
says,
“it
isn't
the
user
or
the
occupier
who
is
subject
to
a
tax”,
it
says,
“such
federal
land
shall
be
subject
to
taxation.”
that's
what
they
say.
now
that
bothers
us
right
from
the
beginning.
the
second
point
is
your
honor
that
when
this
school
district
levied
a
tax
against
phillips
chemical,
and
it's
put
on
tax
rolls,
it's
in
the
record,
they
listed
cactus
ordnance
works,
owner,
phillips
chemical
company
and
they
put
it
on
the
rolls
exactly
the
ways
they
would
have
put
it
on
had
they
been
taxing
the
fee
of
the
property,
and
valued
it
at
its
full
value.
that's
exactly
the
way
it
appeared
and
they
had
on
their
owner
phillips
chemical
company.
now
another
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
gave
a
full
description
of
the
land
just
as
--
as
it
appeared
in
--
in
the
record
of
the
state
of
texas.
now
another
point
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
did
what?
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
but
in
that
case,
they
--
they
list
that.
they
--they
list
the
borg-warner
as
the
user,
that
was
a
use
tax,
and
it
specifically
said
there
that
it
was
a
use
tax.
and
it
said
the
tax
shall
be
directed
against
the
user
of
the
property.
now
here
i
submit,
it
doesn't
say
that
the
tax
is
to
be
directed
against
the
users
of
the
property
and
one
other
point
because
my
time
is
beginning
to
run
out,
the
school
district,
the
dumas
school
district
can
assess,
impose
only
one
kind
of
tax
under
the
constitution
of
texas
and
that
is
an
ad
valorem
tax.
that's
the
only
kind
of
tax
they
can
impose.
so
when
the
school
district
imposed
the
tax,
they
imposed
an
ad
valorem
tax.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
that
is
undisputed.
it
is
--
it's
an
ad
valorem
tax.
now
i
say
again
the
--
they
--
they
have
to
work
out
a
theory
where
it's
an
ad
valorem
tax
only
against
the
lessee
and
that
just
as
--
as
far
as
i
was
concerned,
seem
novel
to
me.
my
closing
remark
phillips
doesn't
want
a
free
ride
in
this
manner;
they
want
only
a
fair
ride.
if
--
if
phillips
--
phillips
has
contended
from
the
day
the
suit
was
filed
that
it
owed
no
tax
under
this
statute,
contended
that
in
the
trial
court,
the
intermediate
court,
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
said
along,
“we
don't
owe
any
tax
under
this
statute.”
i
say
however
that
if
a
statute
were
passed
which
treated
phillips
and
the
other
lessees
of
tax-exempt
property
equitably
and
evenhandedly,
we
could
not
be
heard
to
complain.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
the
only
difference
really
between
their
--
their
ruling
and
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
was
the
court
of
civil
appeals
said
that
the
maximum
tax
that
could
be
assessed
against
phillips
in
this
case
was
a
tax
based
on
the
value
of
the
leasehold.
but
the
supreme
court
of
texas
said
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
we're
going
to
hold
that
phillips
is
liable
for
the
full
tax
based
on
the
value
of
the
fee.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
also,
under
texas
law,
this
tax
becomes
a
lien
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well
that's
the
question.
it
says
that
--
that
when
an
ad
valorem
tax
is
assessed,
that
it
becomes
a
lien
against
--
against
the
property.
it
just
--
it
just
says
it
becomes
a
lien.
and
in
this
instance,
when
the
tax
was
assessed
against
phillips
and
the
cactus
ordnance
works,
a
lien
attached.
now
the
--
the
appellant
says
on
page
53,
texas
says,
“it
is
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
article,
that
is
that
a
lien
shall
attach,
that
the
lien
created
is
against
the
property
or
interest
tax”,
in
this
case,
the
appellant's
leasehold
interest.
now
i
--
i
mentioned
that
because
one,
the
state
of
texas
agrees
that
a
lien
attaches,
page
53.
it's
clear
from
a
reading
of
its
article
that
the
lien
created
is
against
the
property
or
interest
tax.
and
then
they
go
on
and
say,
“the
fact
that
the
lien
attaches
to
the
leasehold
interest
and
that
such
interest
might
conceivably
be
made
the
subject
of
a
tax
paid.”
they
concede
that
so
i
--
i
suggest
to
you
that
we're
beginning
to
enter
an
area
where
the
water
gets
deeper
all
the
time.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well
oh
--
as
i
think
--
i
think
those
cases
would
hold
that
second
sentence.
it
cannot
be
enforced
to
as
--
so
as
to
interfere
with
possession
of
the
united
states
government
that
they
cite
those
cases,
because
one
of
them
is
the
allegheny
case,
the
allegheny
county,
your
honor.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
all
right.
now
in
that
case,
i
think
there
--
all
that
holds
is
the
last
sentence
of
the
preceding
sentence.
since
the
title
of
the
united
states
to
the
property
would
in
nowise
be
thereby
affected.
that's
what
that
minnesota
case
hold.
i
--
i
do
not
recall
a
case
being
presented
to
which
they
talked
about
a
lien
attaching
to
the
leasehold.
but
here
they
concede
the
possibility,
and
i
suggest
only
that
should
the
federal
government
have
a
property
and
have
a
good
tenant
and
the
tenant
doesn't
pay
his
taxes
and
a
lien
attaches
to
the
leasehold,
and
as
they
say
here
it's
probably
subject
to
private
--
to
sale,
i
don't
know
where
that
leads,
the
sovereign
power
of
the
united
states
under
the
constitution
to
manage
its
property
without
interference
from
the
state.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
with
that
last
point?
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
the
supreme
court
of
texas
with
reference
to
the
lien
said
that
no
lien
would
attach
to
the
property
of
the
united
states,
that
the
property
of
the
united
states
was
exempt
from
any
lien.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
they
do
admit
that
the
lien
could
attach
to
the
leasehold.
and
my
recollection
is
that
was
never
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
at
that
particular
point.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
please
your
honors.
in
the
very
few
minutes
i
have
before
noon
recess,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
question
that
this
tax
is
a
tax
against
federal
property.
first,
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
tax
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
has
referred
to.
any
portion
of
federal
lands
leased
to
a
private
party
shall
be
taxed.
that's
the
language
in
the
substance
of
the
statute.
second,
is
this
an
ad
valorem
tax?
the
parties
here
in
their
briefs
concede
that
this
is
an
imposition
of
an
ad
valorem
tax.
on
page
6
of
the
state
of
texas
brief,
it
says
“this
court's
opinion,”
referring
to
the
united
states
supreme
court,
“will
seriously
affect
future
ad
valorem
taxation
by
a
great
number
of
the
county
school
districts
and
other
taxing
authorities
of
the
state.”
we
have
the
language
of
the
statute.
we
have
next
that
it
is
construed
to
be
an
ad
valorem
tax
and
third,
if
your
honors
please,
we
had
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
on
page
109,
each
of
your
honors
has
before
it,
page
109.
we
have
the
entry
in
the
tax
records
of
the
dumas
independent
school
district.
it
says
here,
“owner,
phillips
chemical
company.
address,
p.o.
box,”
and
so
forth,
“amarillo,
texas
for
assessment
of
taxes
for
the
year
1953
by
john
r.
powell,
assessor
of
dumas
independent
school
district,
moore
county,
state
of
texas.”
now,
what
is
that?
all
of
the
following
described
realty
commonly
known
as
cactus
ordnance
works
including
buildings,
improvements,
fixtures,
machinery
and
the
pertinencies
thereto
belonging
and
more
particularly
described
as
follows
to
wit.
there's
a
clerk's
note
here
follows
approximately
10
pages
of
legal
description
of
seven
tracks
of
land,
23
easement
areas
being
identical
to
the
descriptions
found
in
the
lease
from
the
united
states
of
america.
we
would
like
to
suggest
that
when
the
refuge
has
to
be
made
that
the
--
the
language
here
is
not
perhaps
what
they
intended
to
say
but
that
some
construction
will
be
put
upon
it,
i
say
that
the
language
as
it
appears
seems
clear,
it
is
at
no
place
described
as
a
use
tax
in
there.
we
know
that
it
is
an
ad
valorem
tax,
the
briefs
are
replete
with
reference
to
the
ad
valorem
tax
and
then
we
finally
come
down
to
the
entry
in
the
tax
records
and
what
has
taxed
the
cactus
ordnance
works
including
all
of
the
realty,
all
of
the
pertinencies,
all
of
the
machinery
and
so
forth.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
i
would
say
with
reference
to
that,
that
this
court
distinguished
allegheny
from
the
so-called
michigan
cases
because
they
said
that
in
the
allegheny
case,
there
was
no
ruling
there
as
to
whether
a
tax,
a
use
or
occupation
tax,
would
be
valid.
what
the
court
did
say
in
the
allegheny
tax
--
allegheny
case
was
when
federal
property
in
the
possession
of
a
lessee
is
taxed
that
even
though
the
tax
is
directed
to
the
lessee
that
is
an
invalid
tax.
and
as
i
recall,
the
master
machine
works
had
machinery
of
the
federal
government
in
its
plant
and
the
tax
was
levied
upon
other
property
of
master
machine
works
and
that
machinery
that
was
included
in.
and
when
the
tax
bill
came
in,
the
objection
was
made
that
they
owed
no
tax
on
the
federal
property.
the
tax
in
that
case
was
not
the
bill,
it
was
not
sent
to
the
federal
government,
it
was
sent
to
the
--
to
the
master
machine
works.
and
this
court
held
that
the
master
machine
works
didn't
have
to
pay
any
tax
on
that
and
that
particular
effort
was
invalid
and
illegal,
because
it
affects
a
tax
to
federal
property
that
was
in
the
possession
of
the
master
machine
works.
and
in
this
instance,
this
is
federal
property
in
the
hands
of
the
phillips
but
it's
still
federal
property
and
the
tax
attached
to
it.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
thank
you.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
with
very
few
minutes
i
have,
i
shall
direct
myself
quickly
and
briefly
to
two
points
that
have
been
under
discussion.
the
first
is
discrimination.
i
submit
that
no
matter
how
it's
treated
or
how
many
words
you
burry
it
under,
this
situation
is
present
in
this
case.
if
the
federal
government
owns
a
piece
of
property
on
this
side
of
the
road
and
the
state
of
texas
owns
a
piece
of
property
on
this
side
of
the
road.
under
this
statute,
texas
contends
that
when
the
federal
government
leases
that
property,
the
lessee
pays
a
tax
if
it's
for
less
than
three
years.
over
here
on
this
side
of
the
road,
if
a
lessee
leases
the
state
property
and
it's
under
three
years,
he
pays
no
tax.
now,
we
can
not
get
away
from
it.
let
me
broaden
that
out
from
that
simple
illustration
the
one
that
the
chief
justice
has
mentioned.
50
miles
away
from
us
is
the
pantex
ordnance
plant.
part
of
that
the
government
recaptured.
part
of
it,
they
sold
to
the
state
of
texas,
they
sold
the
fee.
and
the
state
of
texas
now
owns,
down
at
the
pantex
plant,
an
area
of
ground
there.
it
is
property,
that
is
public
property
of
the
state
of
texas
and
it's
held
by
the
texas
technological
college
as
an
agency
of
the
state
of
texas.
the
reply
brief
shows
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion
that
down
there
on
the
pantex
ground,
which
is
owned
and
fee
by
the
state
of
texas,
there
are
3
large
warehouses
and
102
small
warehouses,
they
call
“igloos.”
those
are
lease
to
phillips
and
others.
now,
mind
you,
at
the
cactus
ordnance
plant,
the
one
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
there
are
also
great
many
warehouses
there
and
they're
all
listed
in
that
description
of
property
that
went
on
the
tax
rolls.
so,
when
the
tax
is
directed
against
phillips
as
they
attempt
to
do
here
on
the
cactus
plant,
the
one
in
this
case,
phillips
must
pay
a
tax
on
all
of
the
warehouses
that
are
present
on
the
cactus
ordnance
property.
that's
what
they
contend
here.
where
50
miles
away,
the
warehouses,
similar
types
of
warehouses
that
phillips
rents
from
the
state
of
texas
through
the
texas
technological
college,
they
pay
no
tax
on
it.
and
i
submit
to
you,
when
phillips
wants
some
warehouses
and
the
state
has
some
warehouses
to
offer
and
the
federal
government
has
some
warehouses
to
offer,
and
they
both
come
to
phillips,
the
federal
government
says,
“our
warehouses
cost
this
amount.”
and
state
of
texas
says,
“well,
take
our
warehouses,
because
if
you
take
the
federal
government's
warehouses,
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
a
substantial
tax
to
state
of
texas
on
those
federal
warehouses.”
now,
it
comes
down
to
that,
and
mind
you,
if
your
honor
please,
there
is
nothing
in
law
5248
that
says,
“it
is
confined
to
industrial
plants
or
ordnance
works
or
anything
of
that
kind.”
it
says,
“any
property
owned
by
the
federal
government
in
the
state
of
texas
and
if
that's
leased
out,
then,
a
tax
attaches
to
that
property.”
there,
i
submit
is
the
clear
discrimination
in
the
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
there
has
not
been,
your
honor.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
there
has
not
been,
your
honor.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
i
don't
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no.
in
the
record
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes.
but
your
honor,
we'll
have
to
take
my
word
for
it,
because
the
clerk
in
preparing
the
transcript
by
agreement
between
counsels
on
both
sides
did
not
include
10
pages
of
detailed
description
of
every
article
of
property
that
was
in
there.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well,
it's
just
that
we
compared
it
with
the
pantex
plant
as
an
illustration.
and
the
pantex
plant
does
appear
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion
and
there
is
description
there.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no.
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
--
it
is
down
with
the
clerk
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
--
in
--
in
the
moore
county
texas.
and
the
parties
agreed
that
they
would
not
go
into
the
great
detail
of
the
list
of
the
items.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
oh,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
oh,
yes.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
and
all
that
--
all
that
we
did
was
when
we
referred
to
it
in
the
record
was
to
--
was
to
delete
it
down
to
the
point
where
it
referred
to
the
real-estate
and
the
pertinencies
and
so
forth.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
turn
to
the
question
of
classification.
and
i
will
--
i
will
close
with
this.
it
is
suggested
by
the
state
of
texas
that
it
is
proper
to
segregate
lessees
of
federal
property
and
tax
them
alone
on
the
value
of
the
full
fee.
they're
the
only
one
to
mind.
that's
a
separate
classification.
they
say
that
this
is
a
reasonable
classification,
that
it
is
proper,
it
does
in
effect
no
particular
damage
and
--
and
that
state
of
texas
has
the
right
to
set
up
a
reasonable
classification.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
when
we
look
here
to
ascertain
the
reasons
for
this
classification
set
up
by
the
state
of
texas,
i
suggest
we
find
a
remarkable
situation.
mind
you
their
case
is
pretty
well
based
on
the
fact,
this
classification
is
right,
it's
proper,
it's
valid,
it's
legal
and
it's
reasonable.
so,
let's
see
in
effect
when
you
get
down
under
all
the
worlds
what
reason
do
they
give.
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
page
44
of
the
brief
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
page
44.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no,
sir
--
yes
it's
the
amicus
brief.
and
page
44
there,
there
appears
a
summation
of
their
whole
point
on
the
question
of
discrimination
and
on
classification.
look,
if
you
will,
please
at
the
part
on
page
44
that
reads,
“the
state
of
texas
earnestly
submit
one,
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
classification
in
question.”
next
sentence,
“it
acts
as
an
inducement
to
the
leasing
of
state
owned
property.”
now,
if
your
honors
please,
that's
what
we've
contended
from
the
very
beginning
that
the
only
basis
of
classification
is,
if
you
penalize
the
lessees
of
federal
property
and
place
no
penalty
--
similar
penalty
on
the
lessees
of
state
property,
it
acts
as
an
inducement
to
the
leasing
of
state
owned
property.
there
is
the
reason
they
say
for
this
classification.
i
--
i
believe
it's
what
we've
contended.
down
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
44,
the
different
tax
treatment,
mind
you,
there
is
the
recognition
again,
the
different
tax
treatment
of
lessees
of
state
and
federal
property
comports
with
texas
public
policy
by
facilitating
fiscal
considerations.
i
submit,
it
certainly
does
facilitate
fiscal
considerations
for
the
state
of
texas
but
it
places
a
very
serious
burden
upon
the
federal
government
in
its
efforts.
and
i
submit
at
this
point,
a
felicitous
phrase
was
used
by
mr.
justice
brennan
when
he
said
in
the
allied
stores
case.
“this
places
a
burden
upon
federalism.”
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
the
burden
that's
being
placed
upon
the
united
states
government
by
this
specific
action
that
signals
out
lessees
of
federal
property
and
places
this
burden
upon.
over
on
page
45,
this
last
one
at
the
top,
and
says
the
case
--
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
but
to
the
appellant's
interest
in
tax
that
i
wish
to
read.
“it
would
be
extremely
on
just
to
allow
the
appellant
to
escape
its
proportionate
share
of
the
tax
burden
merely
by
a
reason
of
the
slight
difference
in
tax
treatment
between
federal
and
state
lessee.”
mind
you,
the
tax
on
the
federal
lessee
has
grown
now
with
reference
to
this
cactus
plant
was
a
very
substantial
method
well
over
million
dollar.
similar
lessees,
no
tax
at
all,
that's
called
a
very
slight
difference.
and
in
that
regard,
we're
just
starting,
if
your
honors
please.
this
is
the
first
tax,
this
tax
had
been
imposed
by
the
dumas
independent
school
district,
waiting
in
the
wings
are
the
county
and
the
state
who
vindicated.
they
are
ready
also
to
assess
taxes
on
the
property
which
i
guess
they'd
have
to
under
the
law,
if
the
statute
is
held
constitutionally.
and
let
me
submit
one
thing
more.
the
ramifications
that
flow
from
a
--
a
sustaining
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
i
submit
perhaps
would
be
beyond
the
imagination.
if
this
statute
was
sustained
and
the
state
of
texas
can
signal
out
federal
lessees
and
tax
them
and
--
and
not
tax
state
lessees,
i
think
it
is
reasonable
assumption
that
one
state
after
another
will
start
in
and
pass
similar
statute
taxing
lessees
of
federal
property,
and
the
burden
then
on
the
federal
government
will
become
a
norm.
how
can
the
federal
government
conduct
its
business
in
the
handling
of
its
property
which
it
has
given
a
right
to
and
a
supreme
right
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
when
the
various
states
are
permitted
to
signal
out
federal
lessees
and
penalize
them
and
permit
state
lessees
to
go
free
of
taxation?
we
submit
your
honor
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well,
i'm
--
i
believe
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
i
--
i
believe
that
the
question
then
becomes
one
of
what
is
the
reasoning.
what
is
behind
it?
it
is
entirely
possible
that
if
a
new
classification
were
carved
out
for
lessees
of
property
formerly
owned
by
the
government.
it
might
be
that
they
would
be
discriminated
against.
and
in
that
instance,
they
might
be
deprived
of
the
equal
protection
clause
for
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
would
be
entirely
conceivable.
but
in
this
particular
instance,
i
am
saying
it
is
the
burden
that
is
placed
upon
the
federal
government,
so
that
that
of
course
negatives
property
which
is
no
longer
owned
by
the
federal
government.
but
in
this
instance,
we
submit
that
when
the
federal
government
owns
property
and
it's
leased
and
that
burden
is
placed
upon
the
federal
government
and
it's
lessee,
it
makes
that
law
of
the
state
of
texas
unconstitutional.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
the
only
answer
i
could
give
would
be
that
if
the
state
could
prove
that
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
that
classification.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well,
all
right,
i
suppose
i
accept
that.
if
the
reasonable
ground
could
be
attributed,
then
such
a
tax
might
be
valid.
i
do
not
know
there
are
so
many
factors.
but,
what
--
i
keep
getting
back
to
this
because
the
federal
government
is
involved
here
and
the
sovereignty
of
the
federal
government
is
involved,
and
i
submit
that
the
states
cannot
interfere
with
the
sovereign
exercise
of
the
government
over
its
property.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
oh,
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
if
that
property
is
owned
by
the
federal
government
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
state
cannot
interfere
with
the
management
of
that
property
by
the
government,
and
so
pass
laws
that
penalize
the
government.
and
that's
what's
happened
here.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no.
i
--
i
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no,
if
--
if
the
government
owned
the
plant
and
sold
the
plant
to
someone
else,
they
--
they
--
i
would
say
the
immunity
would
then
come
to
an
end.
it's
because
this
plant
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
alright.
if
it
laid
at
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
all
right.
now,
i'm
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
all
right.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
i'm
getting
--
i'm
going
closer
of
i
think
what
you're
driving
at.
if
a
tax
was
based
upon
property
formerly
owned
by
the
government,
and
that
if
that
affected
the
--
the
right
and
ability
of
the
government
to
sell
that
property,
so
that
placed
the
burden
on
the
government
even
though
the
tax
didn't
reach
the
government,
then
i
say
that
violates
the
supremacy
clause
and
should
be
stricken
down
as
invalid,
because
that
burden
is
placed
upon
the
government.
and
we
say
that's
what's
happened
here.
when
you
tax
a
lessee,
you
place
the
burden
on
the
government
just
the
same
as
if
you
tax
the
purchaser
of
government
property
if
that
places
a
load
and
an
unfair
load
on
the
government
of
the
united
states.
thank
you
your
honor.
