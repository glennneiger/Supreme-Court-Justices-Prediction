justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
any
lessors
in
texas
comparable
to
the
united
states
as
the
lessor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there
--
i
know
there
--
i
assume
there
are
lessors,
but
in
the
comparable
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
texas
legislature
has
said,
“whereas
the”
--
and
investigation
has
found
nobody
in
texas
leasing
property
of
such
magnitude
or
under
such
favorable
conditions
of
the
united
states.
therefore,
we
think
to
concede
the
united
states
as
lessor
or
rather
their
lessees
differently
from
the
normal
lessee
in
texas.
does
that
--
does
that
make
a
difference
in
your
view?
well,
they've
found
under
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
the
supreme
court
of
texas
make
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
kind
of
--
like
leasing
to
uncle
sam
does
is
a
big
leasing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
grocery
stores
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
texas
doesn't
tax
itself,
even
though
as
a
lessee,
it
doesn't
tax
itself.
that's
another
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
that
texas
is
now
the
lessee
of
this
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
owner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
gave
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it's
all
amuck
there,
because
texas
doesn't
tax
itself
or
its
beneficiaries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
short
answer
to
my
question
is
that
texas
taxes
come
in
against
uncle
sam
even
if
they
don't
pay
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
supposing,
suppose
the
legislature
having
firmly
said,
“if
it
is
used
by
somebody
else
except
uncle
sam,
the
tax
shall
be
left
measured
by”
--
suppose
--
suppose
they
used
those
words.
you
couldn't
make
the
argument
that
you're
now
making,
you'd
have
to
make
it
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
the
court
--
and
that's
what
supreme
court
of
texas
said
that
in
--
in
the
first
half
of
the
statute,
they
recognized
the
immunities
of
uncle
sam.
and
therefore
in
the
second
--
second
half,
presumably
they
didn't
--
they
simply
contradict
themselves
but
differentiated
between
somebody
enjoining
the
use
--
somebody
utilizing,
that
which
belonged
to
uncle
sam
and
we
will
tax
that
utilization
and
the
determination
of
how
much
shall
be
taxed
as
a
means
of
measurement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
disputed
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
that
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
in
the
process
of
happening?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
curious,
because
one
finishes
the
other
case
and
always
want
to
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
get
your
reference
to
unless
we
lead
from
the
exempt
lessor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
wasn't
the
texas
an
exempt
lessor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
said
the
--
if
this
were
leased
from
texas,
it
wouldn't
be
taxed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
no,
no
i
understand
but
in
the
case
of
three
lease
--
three
--
a
term
of
three
or
more
years
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
from
texas
exempt
lessor,
it's
taxed,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
united
states
is
of
course
a
tax
exempt
lessor
or
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
wonder
that
apart
from
the
basis
of
the
tax,
whether
it's
on
the
rather
they
feel
or
believe,
why
in
these
were
then
why
did
the
lessor
lease
from
uncle
sam
are
similar
both
to
leases
from
texas
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
align
on
our
problem.
i
didn't
realize
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
just
new
lines.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
didn't
believe
it
such
as
is
making
several
classifications.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
their
classification
to
impose
a
tax
on
these
whole
of
property
which
enjoyed
complete
immunity
from
taxation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
if
it's
the
uncle
sam
leaseholds
were
brought
within
by
explicit
statutory
language
within
that
tax-exempt
provision,
would
you
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
the
question
gets
down
to
the
amount
or
the
basis
of
measuring
the
tax,
because
what
you
said
means
to
me
that
texas
could
tax
leaseholds
running
from
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
could
be
found
and
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
if
it
has
the
leasehold
of
tax-exempt
lessors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
this
is
in
need
a
fix
fresh
formula,
it
isn't
quite
less
than
two
years
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
terminable
lease,
which
is
again
a
difference
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
may
make
it
a
differentiation
in
fact
that
the
likelihood
of
a
termination
of
an
uncle
sam
lease
is
less
than
the
likelihood
of
termination
of
a
non-uncle
sam
lease.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
--
they
didn't
reject
to
that
stuff
they
sustained
the
statute,
and
therefore
your
own
version
is
to
show
that
it's
not
sustainable
on
any
fair
implication
or
intent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
have
changed
it
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
examine
the
case
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
if
that's
the
basis
on
which
they
sustained
it
has
to
be
knocked
out
on
the
(inaudible)
of
making
differentiation
with
reference
to
the
various
taxing
statute
and
taxing
classification
of
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
they
--
if
they
could
fairly
by
legislation
differentiate
the
15-year
government
lease
terminable
on
the
30-day
emergency
or
whatever
the
other
provisions.
if
they
could
do
that
by
statute,
then
the
supreme
court
of
texas
can
do
it
to
file
with
the
federal
government,
as
far
as
properties
of
united
states
are
concerned,
by
its
own
judicial
power,
and
if
they
could
do
that,
if
they
could
do
--
i
see
you
shake
your
head
for
that
which
is
said
--
if
they
could
do
that,
then
the
question
would
arises
whether
that
is
a
fair
basis
on
which
they
justified
it
what
you
call
a
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow
don't
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
think
was
wise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
how
about
the
factor
that
ought
to
be
brought
to
this
circuit,
namely
that
uncle
sam
is
trying
to
lease
it,
for
15
years
trying
to
lease
it
with
the
30-day
termination,
(inaudible)
classify
themselves
with
reference
to
other
leases
or
other
lessors
in
texas
that
a
classification
maybe
based
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
--
maybe
this
texas
statute
have
a
lot
of
knowledge
that
we
haven't
gotten.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
month
it
would
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
march.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
that
depend
on
that
they
should
serve
tax
for
what
the
state
is
taxable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
does
tax--
if
it
does
tax
this
with
fee
value
of
the
land
that
maybe
one
thing
to
tax
(inaudible)
the
--
the
--
if
it
puts
in
the
terms
of
what
usually
called
alike
of
excise
tax,
that's
another
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
it
--
the
state
can
tax
certain
monetary
valuable
facility
that
a
person
is
exercising
and
using
of
having
the
benefit
of
and
the
fact
that
it
may
come
from
the
united
states
isn't
approved
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
because
you
mean
it
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
it
doesn't
pick
out
anybody
else
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
advantage
is
enduring
a
person
from
the
united
states
present
or
represent
to
afford
special
kind
of
advantage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
can
also
be
true.
and
then
you're
not
taxing
the
united
states,
you're
taxing
the
benefit
that
a
fellow
derived
from
being
in
abolition
with
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
--
do
you
mean
if
you
gain
advantages
from
the
united
states
as
you
gain
from
no
other
immunized
lessor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
would
that
be
so
because
a
particular
--
a
class
doesn't
have
to
be
expensive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
the
class
contains
all
the
relevant
to
that
class,
then
you
got
a
proper
classification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
this
doesn't
take
you
to
the
question
if
i
may
say
to
the
charge
with
what
--
it's
hard
to
be
attributed
to
you,
the
use
of
(inaudible)
is
hard
to
be
attributed
to
you,
but
if
you
gain
an
advantage
from
the
united
states
which
you
could
not
gain
from
anybody
else
and
you're
the
beneficiary
of
it,
you
don't
tax
the
united
states.
you
tax
the
fellow
and
get
some
advantage
from
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it's
discrimination
of
course,
then
i
draw
off
my
hands.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
question
is
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
point
that
you
used
a
while
ago
is
too
those
loose.
the
quotations
are
getting
out
of
the
case.
it
dies
describe
the
(inaudible)
case,
makes
it
clear
that
you
can't
use
--
you
can't
lump
things,
anybody,
any
person
--
any
person
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
might
have
discrimination
in
such
a
situation
irregardless
of
the
fact
that
the
lessor
is
the
united
states.
if
you
--
if
you
pick
out
--
if
you
--
if
you
--
are
capricious
in
picking
out
a
class
of
lessees
from
lessors
or
in
the
same
relation
to
the
lessor,
that
would
be
discrimination
to
know
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
langley,
whether
you're
going
to
--
you
said
substantially
the
only
collection
is
discrimination
that
--
are
you
or
your
colleague
not
going
to
argue
whether
in
fact
the
incident
of
this
tax
rests
or
would
rest
but
does
rest
upon
the
property
of
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
texas
if
a
church
owns
property
and
it
leases
it,
the
church
is
directly
taxed
for
the
leased
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
that
--
on
that
aspect
of
the
case,
the
present
decision
is
controlling
unless
it
would
be
urged
that
the
supreme
court
made
a
discriminatory
departure
in
this
case
from
a
settled
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
in
this
case
but
before
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
said
more
than
that.
it
has
said
even
if
you
(inaudible)
the
reasonable
basis
for
the
classification,
it
can
be
attributed
to
the
legislature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
prove
it.
you
don't
have
to
show
it
by
legislation
itself,
because
most
legislatures
don't
disclose
the
operation
of
their
minds
that
the
reasons
for
legislations
and
therefore,
you
can
--
you
can
spell
out
some
good
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
the
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
state
supreme
court
can
--
can
give
what
--
on
the
face
of
legislation
may
not
make
interpreted
but
may
put
that
interpretation
on
unless
this
court
finds
that
that's
an
evasion
of
some
other
constitutional
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
these
things
up
because
that's
much
difficult
with
what
the
state
can
retrieve
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
far
does
that
argument
gets
here,
because
i
assume
you
can
see
that
a
state
couldn't
directly
tax
that
property
$18
billion
or
$80
billion
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
nature
of
our
federal
system,
that
is
exempt
from
state
impositions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
answer
i
suppose
you
make
is
--
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
if
a
property
is
in
the
hands
of
the
--
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
advantages
which
may
accrue
to
other
people
to
that
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
your
position
--
you
know
your
position
better
than
i
but
i
thought
your
position
was
that
if
the
levy
sought
to
be
imposed
by
the
state,
it
is
sustainable
on
a
ground
that
doesn't
touch
the
immunity
of
federal
property
and
the
label
that
the
legislature
gave
it
or
the
station
the
supreme
court
gave
it
or
the
label
by
which
it
comes
in
immaterial,
not
that
there
is
no
difference
what
kind
of
an
imposition
is
made,
i
think
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
make
a
difference
what
it
is
not
what
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
it
differ
from
allegheny,
mr.
langley.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
it
differ
from
allegheny?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
done
in
allegheny,
but
the
court
went
beyond
that,
it
wasn't
satisfied
merely
who's
--
who
was
assessed.
the
name
of
the
--
of
the
fellow
on
the
tax
roll.
on
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
did
the
weight
fall
was
the
problem
there,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
good
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
debate
on
this
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
got
a
state
congressional
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
stay,
if
i
may
interrupt,
but
you
must
say
that
it
isn't
a
direct
levy
against
property
owned
by
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
not
saying
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
but
to
that
extent,
if
i
may
say
so,
you
must
answer
mr.
justice
whittaker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
a
tax
on
the
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
position
that
you
have
done
it
and
constitutionally
you
could
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it
isn't
precluded
because
the
introductory
clause
qualifies
the
second
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
wonder
if
you
could
make
--
draw
on
your
--
the
time
that's
left
to
summarize
or
to
add
to
what
mr.
langley
said
at
this
point,
namely,
on
the
question
of
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
what
i
have
in
mind.
this
court
has
said
on
one
occasion,
when
dealing
with
questions
of
that
sort,
this
court
was
taken
to
account
the
whole
tax
scheme
of
a
state,
not
merely
a
specific
statute
but
a
large
specific
statute
challenged
for
discrimination.
there's
nothing
about
it.
it's
the
duty
of
this
court
to
look
to
the
other
--
all
other
tax
provisions
of
the
state
to
see
where
this
particular
one
fits
into
the
mosaic
of
tax
measure.
now,
would
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
not
resting
this
tax
under
military
leasing
act,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
all
the
talk
that
this
couldn't
be
taxed
by
texas
is
fancible,
isn't
it,
i
mean
is
--
is
a
non-real
thing.
the
suggestion
--
the
suggestion
that
if
this
kind
of
a
lease
were
made
by
texas,
the
property
could
not
be
taxed
by
texas
is
based
on
assumption,
on
a
non-adjusting
assumption
that
texas
could
lease
such
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
so
there's
no
discrimination.

and
then
it
might
be
called
discrimination.
justice

frankfurter
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
five
years
from
now
or
two
years
from
now,
texas
is
empowered
to
acquire
--
has
property
or
acquires
property
like
on
to
phillips
and
then
leases
like
under
this
lease,
two
years
from
now.
and
--
and
otherwise
the
situation
remains
the
same,
namely,
phillips
has
taxed
and
the
texas
phillips
--
texas
leased
phillips,
is
not
taxed.
what
happens
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
this
problem
has
set
again
and
again
something
maybe
constitutional
today
and
become
unconstitutional
next
year
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
very
same
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
don't
hear
your
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
a
classification,
i'm
asking,
i
don't
know
and
i
must
quarrel
the
chief
justice.
are
you
saying
that
a
classification
as
between
an
industrial
manufacturing
plant
and
a
warehouse
is
also
in
the
part
of
classification?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
if
you
had
a
comparable
government
lease,
u.s.
government
lease,
storage
house,
it
would
be
taxable
under
your
statute,
would
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that
open?
it's
not
open
under
the
statute,
is
it,
the
statute
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
--
you
say
to
that
for
the
under
state
construction
might
be
limited
so
as
to
apply
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
are
you
saying
that
a
like
lease
from
the
united
states
of
the
identity
property,
would
you
found
exempt
under
state
law
would
have
the
benefit
of
those
exemptions?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
if
--
if
not,
if
not,
i
should
think
you
must
claim
that
they
would
enjoy
the
same
exemption
of
the
state
because
then,
although
there
might
be
different
proper
classifications
between
industrial
plants
and
the
non-industrial
plants,
there
can't
be
a
classification
between
non-industrial
plants
leased
by
the
government
and
non-industrial
plants
leased
by
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
--
are
you
saying
that
the
state
can
protect
its
fiscal
interest
by
the
price
--
by
the
--
by
the
leasing
price
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
would
be
in
lieu
of
the
use
the
phrase
of
statutes,
in
lieu
of
what
it
might
directly
impose
upon
taxes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
against
leases
by
the
federal
government
which
are
entirely
outside
the
control
of
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
list
of
enumerated
properties
on
which
this
tax
sought
to
be
levied?
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
see
the
enumeration
of
items
for
which
or
on
which
the
tax
is
imposed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
does
that
include
these
warehouses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
does
that
include
these
warehouses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
i
take
your
word
for
it,
but
i
think
that
what
seems
to
you
as
mathematical
demonstration
of
discrimination
to
be
let
out
of
the
record
is
a
little
odd,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
10
pages
of
38
--
this
10
pages
of
enumerations
on
that,
beginning
on
page
39,
any
taxes
upon
the
property
known
as
cactus
ordnance
works
is
described
these
followers.
and
what
you're
saying
is
if
i
understand
you
that
that
would
well
have
been
item
24,
these
warehouses,
is
that
it?
