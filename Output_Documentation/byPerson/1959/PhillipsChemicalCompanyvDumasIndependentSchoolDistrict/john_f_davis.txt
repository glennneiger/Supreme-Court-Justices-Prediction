mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
clifford's
client,
the
phillips
chemical
company
has
something
like
$300,000
writing
on
the
outcome
of
this
case.
if
the
$19
billion
of
real
and
personal
property
under
lease
by
the
united
states
is
to
be
subjected
to
discriminatory
taxation
by
the
state,
the
ultimate
cost
to
the
united
states
maybe
much
more
than
the
$658
million
a
year
which
we
estimated
would
be
the
tax
in
our
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
murray
case
a
year
and
a
half
ago.
mr.
john
f.
davis
has
it
--
it
--
it
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
in
the
process
of
happening.
it
hasn't
reached
that
figure
because
some
--
many
states
have
not
imposed
this
tax.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
it's
--
it
is
happening
in
--
in
by
steps
in
california
or
in
new
jersey,
and
then
in
other
places,
it's
not
--
it's
not
happening
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
i
think
it's
very
significant
too,
much
of
this
tax
although
taxed
against
lessees,
well
of
course,
ultimately
come
from
the
united
states.
now
in
the
--
in
the
usual
tax
case
in
this
court,
one
has
a
private
taxpayer
who
was
drowning
under
the
--
under
the
weight
of
the
increasing
burden
of
federal
taxation.
the
tables
are
somewhat
turned
in
this
case
although
it
isn't
so
much
the
weight
of
the
burden
that
we're
drowning
under
as
it
is
the
distribution
of
that
burden.
here
is
a
tax
which
is
imposed
by
a
state,
which
specifically
and
intentionally
and
discriminatorily
is
imposed
upon
lessees
of
the
united
states.
now
nothing
that
this
court
has
decided
in
this
field
of
intergovernmental
taxation
would
justify
such
a
levy.
on
the
contrary,
the
very
nature
of
2070
in
this
field
requires
that
it
be
forbidden.
and
by
this
i'm
not
meaning
to
reargue
the
cases
which
have
been
presented
to
this
court
within
the
last
two
years.
if
texas
and
its
cities
and
towns
and
school
districts
has
need
as
it
undoubtedly
does
of
revenue
from
properties
which
are
used
for
commercial
purposes.
it
may
extract
a
fair
portion
of
that
from
the
pockets
of
--
of
federal
lessees.
what
we
are
arguing
against
is
what
mr.
clifford
made
very
clear
a
situation
where
there
is
a
discriminatory
tax
which
is
imposed
upon
the
--
the
lessees
from
the
federal
government
and
is
not
imposed
upon
lessees
from
the
state
governments.
now
under
the
texas
law,
as
interpreted
by
the
texas
supreme
court,
a
lessee
from
any
person
other
than
the
federal
government
is
not
taxed
upon
his
lease,
not
on
the
leasehold
nor
on
the
fee,
unless
he
has
a
term
of
more
than
three
years
and
then
unless
he
is
leasing
from
an
exempt
--
an
exempt
entity.
and
that
is
to
be
contrasted
with
the
type
of
situation
here
where
the
lease
does
not
extend
for
over
three
years
and
where
they
are
taxing
upon
the
entire
value
of
the
--
of
the
enterprise.
in
other
words,
if
the
phillips
chemical
company
itself
had
leased
this
property
from
the
state
of
texas,
i
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
there
would
be
no
tax
at
all
involved.
but
because
they
are
leasing
the
property
from
the
united
states,
there
is
a
tax
imposed,
and
this
is
the
kind
of
situation
which
was
involved
in
mcculloch
against
maryland.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
ordinarily
the
owner
of
property
is
--
is
taxed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
because
it
is
not
--
it
is
--
it
is
less
than
three
years.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
there
is
no
general
tax
on
lessees,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
f.
davis
from
texas.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
were
from
--
even
if
it
were
from
texas,
it
would
be
taxable.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
taxed
to
the
extent
of
the
--
of
the
late
leasehold
interest.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
then
they
have
a
special
provision
which
takes
the
united
states
out
of
that
group
and
says
but
if
you
lease
from
the
united
states,
then
you
shall
be
taxed
from
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
–
i
think
it
would
be
in
the
absence
of
this
special
statute.
i
think
this
lessee
would
be
subject
to
a
tax
under
the
other
provisions
of
the
law
as
a
lessee
or
possessor
from
a
tax.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
--
that
provision
has
been
on
the
books
for
years
and
years
and
so
far
as
i
know
there's
never
been
any
--
any
dispute
about
the
--
about
the
validity
of
that
provision.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
this
--
then
it
would
be
the
same
situation
that
you'd
had
in
the
michigan.
we
would
have
been
here
two
years
ago
but
we
wouldn't
be
here
now
because
the
michigan
cases,
they
brought
one
again.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh
i
think
it
could.
i
think
under
the
michigan
cases
it
could.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
--
not
only
the
amount
but
also
the
imposition
because
it's
imposed
on
united
states
and
situations
in
these
lessees
from
the
united
states
and
situations
where
nothing
is
imposed
in
leases
from
the
state.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
because
of
the
three-year
provision
unless
the
lease
is
a
lease
of
three
years
or
more
without
any
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
then
may
i
think
found
by
the
texas
supreme
court's
construction
of
what
a
lease
for
three
years
is
and
they're
very
definite
that
if
a
lease
is
terminable
why
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
could
but
they
haven't
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
and
as
i
read
the
texas'
own
construction
of
what
a
lease
for
three
years
is
as
set
forth
in
trammell
against
faught,
the
old
case,
this
as
--
they
may
change
it
and
they
can
change
for
the
state
and
for
the
federal
government
at
the
same
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
didn't
even
consider
in
this
case
the
length
for
the
term.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
in
this
case,
the
statute
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
statute
under
which
this
tax
is
applied.
they're
applying
this
tax
not
under
the
three-year
lease
provision
but
under
another
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
so
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
both
in
amount
and
in
impact,
in
both,
in
both
in
respects
of.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
insofar
as
the
question
of
construction
of
--
of
article
7173
of
the
texas
taxing
law
which
is
the
statute
which
has
the
three-year
provision
that
i
would
think
it
was
a
matter
of
probably
of
state
law.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
15
--
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
which
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that
if
texas
has
such
an
interpretation
as
to
what
falls
within
that
taxing
statute
and
it's
actual
equally
applied
to
leases
from
the
state
and
leases
from
united
states
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
no,
it's
--
because
no
one
was
trying
to
tax
under
the
three-year
statute.
so
that
it
--
it
was
--
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
in
--
in
the
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
state
could
classify,
could
make
reasonable
classifications.
and
if
there
were
a
factual
basis
for
distinguishing
apart
from
the
immunity
of
the
federal
government
from
taxation,
if
there
were
a
basis
that
they
could
find
a
point
to
where
this
was
economically
or
from
tax-wise
or
from
the
impact
on
the
county
a
different
problem,
then
you
might
be
able
to
justify
the
classification
but
when
the
only
basis
for
the
classification
would
be
that
we
cannot
tax
the
united
states,
therefore
we
have
to
tax
the
lessees
of
the
united
states
differently
than
we
tax
the
other,
i
think
that
is
not
a
reasonable
classification
for
the
legislature.
now,
if
it's
not
a
reasonable
classification
for
the
legislature,
i
think
equally
it
cannot
be
for
the
supreme
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
for
any
such
--
for
any
such
discrimination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we
--
we
have
some
knowledge
of
what's
going
on
in
texas
even
if
it
isn't
in
the
record,
because
the
texas
statutes
themselves
recognize
that
the
state
of
texas
and
its
municipality
is
--
is
deep
in
the
real-estate
field
and
in
the
field
of
--
of
leasing
commercial
real
estate.
i
refer
specifically
for
example
to
the
provisions
with
respect
to
air
fields,
the
municipalities,
town,
cities
and
towns
of
texas
are
authorized
specifically
to
develop
air
fields
and
to
lease
the
properties
which
they
include
in
the
air
field
to
private
companies
for
commercial
purposes
and
not
only
for
--
for
terminal
uses
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
even
for
the
manufacture
of
--
of
and
assembly
of
military
(inaudible).
so
that
here
we
have
texas
itself
authorizing
its
municipalities
to
go
into
this
kind,
if
you
want
to
call
it,
of
leasing
of
municipal
property
for
government
purposes
with
tax
exemption.
we've
got
the
legislature
specifically
authorizing
it
for
the
air
fields,
municipalities
and
the
air
fields,
and
denying
it
for
the
federal
government.
and
that's
not
the
only
example.
the
--
the
court
facilities
are
handled
in
the
similar
--
in
a
similar
way.
those
parts
of
the
houston
ship
channel
which
didn't
burn
up
the
other
day
are
being
used
now
for
commercial
purposes
and
many
of
them
much
of
it
are
under
lease
and
this
too
is
under
statute,
under
the
texas
statute.
the
state
--
the
municipality
called
the
navigation
district,
develops
this
property
and
makes
it
available
to
commercial
shipping
companies,
oil
companies,
cotton
companies
for
commercial
purposes.
and
some
of
that
is
--
done
on
a
--
on
a
license
basis
and
some
it's
done
on
--
on
a
lease
basis,
but
it's
handed
over
to
them
for
--
for
their
actual
use.
so,
you
don't
really
--
it's
not
case
of
texas
just
leasing
--
raising
land
or
agricultural
land,
texas
is
like
the
other
states
is
--
is
deep
in
this
real-estate
business.
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
example
what
happened
in
new
york
recently
is
--
is
pertinent
to
this.
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
michigan
cases,
the
state
of
new
york
passed
a
law
which
attempted
to
tax
lessees,
users
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
had
upheld
in
--
for
the
michigan
statutes.
i
said
the
legislature
passed
it.
when
the
city
of
new
york
and
--
and
the
port
authority
became
aware
of
what
was
going
on
and
that
their
properties,
which
they
leased
for
commercial
purposes,
were
going
to
be
subject
to
lease,
they
(inaudible),
and
it
affected
the
bonds,
it
affected
their
whole
financial
setup.
and
they
took
themselves
all
in
a
hurry
because
this
equal
taxation
was
going
--
was
going
to
hit
them
pretty
hard
and
the
statute
was
--
was
vetoed
by
--
by
the
governor
of
--
of
new
york.
and
i
think
that
illustrates
specifically
that
this
isn't
a
--
a
formal
matter
that
it's
not
a
question
of
just
writing
into
the
law,
this
shall
apply
to
the
state
properties,
it's
--
it's
a
matter
of
real
importance
to
--
to
these
municipalities
who
are
in
the
business
of
making
this
type
of
commercial
lease
and
the
state
--
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
form
to
write
a
statute
in
a
particular
way,
it's
a
matter
of
real
economics
as
to
whether
they
do
want
to
have
equality
of
taxes
between
lessees
from
the
state
and
from
the
municipalities.
texas
attempts
to
meet
this
claim
of
discrimination
on
--
with
three
replies.
first,
it
claims,
or
at
least
the
school
district
claims,
that
the
exemption
is
lost,
the
state
exemption
was
lost
in
the
case
the
property
has
leased
the
commercial
--
for
commercial
uses.
and
i
think
that
this
is
true
technically
at
least
with
respect
to
properties
of
charitable
institutions
which
are
exempt
for
that
reason.
i
think
if
they
go
into
business,
or
lease
the
people
who
are
in
business,
they
do
lose
their
exemption.
but
this
specifically
is
not
true
with
respect
to
towns,
municipalities
and
states.
their
exemption
continues
as
long
as
they
have
not
abandoned
the
ultimate
use
of
this
property
for
a
governmental
purpose
and
as
long
as
they
are
using
the
current
rentals
for
governmental
--
for
--
for
state
or
municipal
purposes.
under
these
circumstances,
the
exemption
continues
even
though
they
are
renting
for
commercial
use.
and
as
i
--
i
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
this
type
of
commercial
lease
is
specifically
recognized
by
the
--
by
the
statutes
in
texas.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
was
asked
what
had
transpired
practically
since
the
court's
decision
in
the
associated
cases,
similar
cases
year
and
a
half
ago,
and
i
think
i
made
a
rather
inadequate
answer.
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
if
--
to
an
article
which
appears
in
the
march
issue
of
the
wisconsin
law
review,
an
article
by
mr.
harry
van
cleve
of
the
general
counsel
office
of
department
of
defense.
and
this
article
reviews
in
some
detail
what
has,
in
fact,
occurred
as
a
result
of
those
decisions
and
it
can
do
much
better.
mr.
john
f.
davis
march.
mr.
john
f.
davis
march.
wisconsin
law
review
from
march
by
mr.
van
cleve.
there
are
two
rather
important
aspects
of
this
case
which
mr.
clifford
promised
i
would
deal
with
and
which
i
haven't
even
touched
yet
and
which
i'd
like
to
devote
the
rest
of
my
time
to.
first
of
this
is
the
question
of
classification.
the
state
of
texas
attempts
to
justify
the
peculiar
application
of
this
statute
to
lessees
of
the
united
states
from
the
ground
that
this
is
a
matter
of
classification.
now,
it
is
true
that
taxing
authorities
are
given
a
good
deal
of
latitude
in
making
classifications
among
taxpayers
in
assessing
different
taxpayers
at
different
rates.
and
there's
no
reason
why
reasonable
classifications
shouldn't
apply
to
the
united
states
or
lessees
of
the
united
states
rather
when
they're
taxpayers
as
well
as
to
anybody
else.
but
as
applied
to
this
case,
it
--
it
really
doesn't
--
it
really
doesn't
help
them
because
when
their
arguments
are
sifted
down
to
the
--
to
the
rock
bottom,
we
find
that
the
--
really
the
basis
for
classification
that
they
would
--
would
apply
in
this
case
is
that
the
united
states
is
exempt
from
taxation
and
therefore,
they
cannot
tax
the
lessor
and
therefore,
it's
a
reasonable
classification
to
tax
the
lessees.
well,
this
--
this
really
is
not
--
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
as
a
matter
of
classification.
it's
merely
another
way
of
saying
that
the
united
states
is
exempted
and
we
have
to
get
around
it
in
some
way
in
it
--
a
way
of
destroying
the
--
destroying
the
--
the
exemption.
in
other
words,
as
they
would
use
the
term
“classification”
and
saying
that
we
can
discriminate
without
any
--
without
any
basis
other
than
a
--
a
basis
that
otherwise
would
not
be
able
to
raise
our
revenues.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
depends
on
--
on
the
basis
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that
is
right
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
but
when
they
pick
out
the
united
states,
a
lease
from
the
united
states
as
being
peculiarly
subject
to
a
use
tax
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
it
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
that's
what
i
mean
by
discrimination.
that's
--
it
is
--
and
the
reason
for
it
is
not
a
--
a
business
reason,
a
tax
reason
and
--
and
economic
reason,
it's
just
to
get
away
from
the
exemption
which
is
in
the
constitution.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
you
would
then
be
discriminating
against
the
united
states.
if
the
united
states
were
the
only
lessor
that
was
in
that
field,
even
though
you
could
find
some
business
reason,
it
still
seems
to
me
that
this
is
discrimination
when
you
are
picking
out
a
lessee
from
the
united
states.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
if
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there's
no
doubt,
for
example
that,
in
new
york,
they
can
classify
cities
and
they
can
set
a
city
which
is
--
which
only
new
york
city
will
meet.
they
do
it,
and
that's
--
it's
--
it's
considered
a
reasonable
basis
for
classification.
that
there
you
have
no
constitutional
question
of
imposing
a
tax
on
another
sovereignty.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
you're
--
the
tax
is
not
on
the
united
states
but
this
court
has
consistently
held,
not
only
that
you
may
not
tax
the
united
states,
but
you
may
not
tax
people
who
deal
with
the
united
states
when
the
result
is
discrimination
against
the
united
states.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
is
it
discrimination?
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
that
when
the
basis
of
it
is
that
it
is
leased
from
the
united
states,
even
though
there
are
very
good
reasons
why
lessees
from
the
united
states
should
pay
the
tax.
if
the
reason
is
that
it
is
leased
from
the
united
states,
then
i
think
that
is
what
you
mean
by
discrimination.
you
are
picking
out
the
united
states
as
a
particular
lessor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
dealing
with
--
oh,
that's
right,
the
lessee
is
--
there
--
there's
no
question
that
all
lessees
can
be
--
can
be
taxed
and
there's
no
question
that
these
lessees
can
be
taxed
as
long
as
they're
not
picked
out
from
--
from
the
group.
the
other
--
the
other
issue
that
i
must
speak
about
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
would
be
a
matter
of
due
process.
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
right.
that
--
that
is
true.
the
--
the
other
thing
that
i
must
mention
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states
has
given
permission
to
this
tax.
the
state
of
texas
school
district
rely
upon
section
6
of
the
military
leasing
act
as
a
specific
permission
from
congress
that
this
type
of
tax
should
be
imposed.
and
i
think
that
we
must
look
at
this
section
which
appears
at
page
15
of
the
government's
brief
amicus.
section
6
of
the
military
leasing
act,
and
it
was
under
this
act
that
this
lease
was
made,
provides
in
the
first
sentence,
the
lease
--
“the
lessees'
interest
made
or
created
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
made
subject
to
state
or
local
taxation.
and
the
state
relies
upon
this
as
state
--
as
ground
for
saying
that
congress
has
agreed
to
the
type
of
tax
which
is
involved
in
this
case.”
now,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
this.
the
first
is
that
if
you
read
section
6
as
a
whole,
you
will
find
that
the
section,
the
second
section
states
that
in
the
event
that
congress
shall
agree
that
the
property
as
such
is
to
be
taxable
by
the
state,
then
the
lease
made
pursuant
to
this
act
shall
be
subject
to
renegotiation.
now,
that
was
put
in
there
because
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
there
was
a
strong
movement
in
congress
to
subject
federal
leased
property
to
state
taxation
as
though
it
were
owned
by
the
--
by
the
lessees,
and
there
were
at
least
17
bills
pending,
and
there
was
probability
of
likelihood
that
some
of
them
would
be
passed.
and
if
they
were
passed,
congress
felt
that
then
the
lessees
should
be
in
a
position
to
renegotiate
with
the
united
states
and
under
that
--
that
rentals
be
adjusted
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
additional
burden.
now,
when
you
read
this
section
then
in
connection
with
the
first
sentence,
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
say
that
the
first
sentence
was
this
very
kind
of
permission
which
they
are
dealing
with
in
the
second
sentence.
and
that
means
that
the
first
sentence
must
mean
that
congress
was
consenting
to
the
kind
of
taxation
which
indeed
had
occurred
in
texas
before
this,
taxation
of
the
leasehold
under
circumstances
where
the
leasehold
--
the
lessees
from
the
united
states
were
taxed
in
the
same
manner
as
the
lessees
from
the
state.
and
we
believe
that
that
is
what
--
if
you
--
if
you
read
the
--
the
hearings,
the
--
the
committee
hearings
and
the
reports,
i
think
that's
--
you
will
conclude
that
first
sentence
means.
if
so,
it
isn't
a
consent
to
the
kind
of
taxation
which
is
tried
to
--
which
is
attempted
to
be
imposed
in
this
case.
no
one
is
--
is
more
conscious
of
the
--
the
problems
of
the
interrelationship
of
taxes
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
than
congress
and
defense
department.
these
are
the
problems
that
--
that
are
very
serious,
they're
very
--
they're
very
real
in
the
sense
that
there
are
federally
impacted
areas
where
the
states
are
not
in
a
position
to
raise
the
taxes
from
the
federal
property
in
order
to
carry
out
their
--
their
municipal
problems.
school
is
a
--
is
a
prime
example.
so
this
is
--
it's
--
it's
a
real
problem
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
states
as
well
as
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
federal
government.
and
congress
has,
in
part,
attempted
to
deal
with
this
through
legislations,
specific
legislation.
special
grants
in
aid
of
education
are
made
in
order
to
take
care
of
that
situation.
and
in
this
very
situation
in
texas
that
we're
dealing
with,
the
dumas
school
district
has
applied
for
and
has
received
grants
to
aid
education
to
the
extent
of
about
$200,000.
that
appears
in
detail
in
--
in
the
record.
