mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
which
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
sixth
circuit
is
an
outgrowth
of
an
order
of
the
labor
board
that
was
originally
entered
in
the
year
1949.
the
question
here
today
is
solely
one
of
the
compliance,
respondents
having
successfully
avoided
that
necessity
now
for
more
than
a
decade.
the
issue
is
an
important
one
in
our
view
because
we
think
it
bears
directly
upon
the
power
and
the
responsibility
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
implement
their
decrees,
affirming
labor
board
orders.
the
precise
judgment
here
under
review,
is
one
which
dismissed
a
petition
to
adjudge
various
respondents
in
civil
contempt
for
refusing
to
pay
certain
amounts
of
back
pay,
aggregating
approximately
$300,000
dollars
due
to
some
60
odd
employees,
who
were
discriminatorily
discharged
by
one
of
the
respondents,
a
company
known
as
deena
artware.
let
me
go
back
and
attempt
to
summarize
briefly
the
rather
remarkable
sequence
of
proceedings
which
has
brought
this
protracted
litigation
to
its
present
resting
place.
deena
artware
is
one
of
the
numbers
of
subsidiaries
of
a
corporation
known
as
deena
products.
collectively,
the
company
has
been
engaged
in
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
lamps.
deena
artware,
located
in
kentucky,
had
the
function
of
a
manufacturing
subsidiary
of
making
the
urns
or
bases
for
these
lamps.
in
1948,
there
was
a
breakdown
of
collective
bargaining
at
the
deena
artware
plant
and
a
strike
ensued.
as
a
result
of
the
labor
board
proceedings,
a
board
order
issued
in
1949,
finding
that
the
company
had
been
guilty
of
various
unfair
labor
practices
and
directing
that
employees
who
had
been
discriminatorily
discharged
and
denied
reinstatement
--
be
reinstated
with
back
pay.
that
labor
board
order
was
reviewed
in
due
course
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
1952,
affirmed
it.
a
decree
of
enforcement
was
entered
at
that
time
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
company
sought
certiorari,
certiorari
was
denied.
the
next
step
in
this
litigation
was
in
1953,
a
year
later,
at
which
time
the
board
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
with
a
motion
to
restrain
deena
artware
from
making
a
partial
assignment
of
assets,
alleging
in
support
of
that
motion,
that
certain
of
artware's
assets
were
being
diverted
to
other
members
of
the
inter
corporate
family
in
order
to
frustrate
the
enforcement
of
the
back
pay
obligation.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
that
motion
for
an
injunction
and
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
it
observed
that
although
there
was
a
decree,
requiring
the
company
to
make
restitution,
the
board
had
not
yet
completed
its
supplementary
proceedings
in
which
it
would
determine
the
exact
amounts
due
each
individual
employee.
and
the
court
said
that
--
that
in
this
circumstance,
there
was
no
need
for
an
injunction
at
that
time.
and
if
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
think
proceeding
had
commenced
but
it
was
not
completed
until
substantially
later.
the
court
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
clearly
not,
your
honor
because
these
are
the
words
of
the
opinion.
it
will
be
time
enough
"to
rule
on
any
question
of
contempt,
when
the
order
to
pay
becomes
liquidated
and
final
if
at
that
time,
any
financial
inability
on
the
part
of
respondent
to
pay
the
awards,
is
shown
to
be
the
result
of
improper
actions
on
its
part
in
the
meantime,
appropriate
contempt
action
can
then
be
taken"
and
that
--
that
is
from
page
56
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
petition.
that
isn't
the
--
the
last
opinion,
that's
the
53
opinion
and
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
emphasized
the
--
those
words
in
meantime,
that
if
in
the
meantime,
the
company
renders
itself
financial
unable,
it
would
be
time
enough
for
a
contempt
action.
since
those
words
are
striking
indeed
in
view
of
the
later
developments
in
this
case.
in
1955,
the
board
came
down
with
its
supplemental
decision
which
determined
the
specific
amounts
of
back
pay
due
each
of
the
employees
after
making
due
allowance
for
offsetting
items
such
as
amount
that
were
earned
or
could
have
been
earned
in
equivalent
employment,
the
same
year
1955
that
order
was
duly
affirmed
and
enforced
by
the
court
of
appeals'
decree.
no
payments
however
were
forth
coming.
accordingly,
in
1957,
the
board
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
again,
asking
this
time
that
the
court
order
discovery
and
to
taking
a
various
depositions
from
deena
artware's
officers.
the
board
alleged
in
support
of
that
motion,
that
it
had
reason
to
believe
that
deena
artware
assets
had
been
or
were
being
siphoned
off
in
various
ways
and
it
sought
access
to
corporate
records
and
to
the
testimony
of
the
officers
in
order
to
be
able
to
develop
fully
such
facts
as
would
show
whether
an
application
for
a
contempt
adjudication
was
warranted.
that
motion
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
judge,
now
mr.
justice
stewart,
dissenting
from
the
determination.
the
majority
said
two
things
that
i
should
like
to
note.
it
said
first
that
it
would
deny
the
motion
because
no
formal
contempt
charge
had
been
lodged.
it
said
in
that
connection
whether
the
facts
as
claimed
by
the
board
would
constitute
contempt
is
a
legal
question
which
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
have
decided
before
it
is
put
to
the
expenditure
of
considerable
time
and
money
in
producing
the
evidence
out
of
which
the
claimant
hopes
to
sustain
his
allegation.
secondly,
the
court
suggested
to
the
board,
the
possibility
of
instituting
an
independent
proceeding
in
a
trial
court,
to
set
aside
conveyances
as
being
in
fraud
of
creditors.
judge
stewart's
dissent
took
exception
on
both
of
these
points.
he
declared
that
if
it
appeared
that
contempt
may
have
been
committed,
the
board
should
be
afforded
to
means
of
conducting
of
full
investigation
rather
than
required
to
file
an
immediate
charge
of
contempt
and
he
expressed
himself
as
far
more
concern
with
the
second
point
made
by
the
majority
and
his
dissenting
opinion
insists
we
think
correctly,
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
enforce
labor
board
orders
and
that
therefore
it
has
a
non-delegable
duty
to
implement
its
decrees
of
enforcement
whenever
it
appears
that
there
is
or
may
have
been
a
failure
of
compliance.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
to
the
extent
of
referring
to
a
special
master
if
that
were
necessary
to
determine
facts,
a
procedure
which
has
been
adopted
on
frequent
occasions
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
determining
whether
there
has
been
in
fact
a
contempt
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decree.
we
do
not
list
--
give
a
listing
of
the
various
contempt
proceedings
in
which
it
has
been
necessary
to
refer
matters
to
a
master,
but
there
have
been
very
numerous
in
the
board
history,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
labor
board
orders,
your
honor
has
been
enforced
exclusively
to
the
contempt
process.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
one
indication
that
that
is
not
the
exclusive
means,
is
that
in
one
case
involving
a
bankrupt
to
state,
a
case
which
came
ultimately
to
this
court.
the
board
was
allowed
to
appear
as
a
claimant
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
(inaudible)
next
to
the
(inaudible)
in
which
it
ruled
that
it
would
not
order
discovery
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
charge
of
contempt.
having
been
told
that,
the
board
undertook
further
investigation
to
the
extent
that
this
was
possible
without
access
to
the
books
and
records
and
testimony.
and
it
formulated
a
rather
detailed
contempt
petition
which
appears
at
record
3
to
13.
that
petition
for
contempt
is
directed
not
only
against
deena
artware,
the
company
involved
in
the
original
unfair
labor
practice,
but
also
against
the
parent
company,
deena
products
against
various
other
subsidiaries
of
deena
products
to
which
deena
artware's
assets
were
ultimately
transferred
and
against
george
weiner,
the
president
of
all
of
these
corporations
and
the
controlling
stockholder
of
the
parent
company.
this
contempt
petition,
filed
in
august
of
1958,
was
accompanied
by
a
renewed
motion
for
discovery.
the
court's
final
decision
of
december
1958
dismissed
the
contempt
petition
and
denied
the
motion
for
discovery.
it's
that
judgment,
of
course,
that's
under
review
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
dismissed
on
motion.
and
the
court's
opinion
says
that
the
1952
decree
of
the
court
enforcing
the
board's
original
order
was
not
sufficiently
definite
so
far
as
restitution
of
back
pay
was
concerned
to
support
a
contempt
adjudication.
the
reason
the
court
says
is
that
the
19
--
the
early
--
original
board
order
left
undetermined
the
exact
amounts
due
each
employee,
merely
ordered
that
each
one
of
them
be
made
whole.
then
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
accordingly,
there
was
no
binding
decree
until
the
1955
order
of
the
court
which
enforced
the
board's
supplemental
decision
position,
but
reasons
the
court,
between
1952
and
1955,
deena
artware,
on
the
board's
own
allegations,
had
completed
the
process
with
making
itself
judgment
proof
and
after
1955
was
unable
to
pay.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
correct.
thus
it
seems
to
us,
we've
come
full
circle
in
this
case.
the
board
having
first
been
told
in
1953
when
it
diligently
came
in
and
sought
to
enjoin
a
partial
assignment
of
assets
that
it
was
premature,
and
that
it
could
always
come
back
after
the
back
pay
obligation
was
liquidated
if,
in
the
meantime,
deena
artware
had
purposefully
stripped
itself
of
its
assets.
it's
told
ultimately
when
it
does
come
back
with
the
petition
for
contempt
on
that
very
basis
that
at
last
it
is
now
too
late.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
appears
in
the
court's
1953
opinion
which
is
setout
beginning
at
page
51
of
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner.
i'm
looking
for
the
precise
language
that
i
referred
to.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
beginning
about
two
thirds
of
the
way
down
on
56.
it
will
be
time
enough,
the
sentence
begins,
to
rule
on
any
question
of
contempt
when
the
order
becomes
liquidated
and
final.
if
at
that
time
any
financial
inability
to
pay
the
award
as
shown
to
be
the
result
of
improper
actions
on
its
part
in
the
meantime
appropriate
contempt
action
can
then
be
taken.
our
--
our
position
in
relation
to
the
court
of
appeals'
latest
opinion
can
be
summed
up
very
simply,
i
think.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
its
1952
decree,
directing
the
company
to
make
restitution
to
the
named
employees
did
not
impose
a
present
obligation
to
pay
specific
sums.
certainly,
it
was
contemplated
that
the
board,
in
accordance
with
its
usual
practice,
would
exercise
its
continuing
jurisdiction
and
that
it
would
conduct
such
supplemental
proceedings
as
might
be
necessary
failing
agreements
between
the
parties
to
determine
the
exact
amounts
due.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
have
--
in
a
moment
i
would
like
to
review
briefly
the
series
of
acts.
there
are
number
of
them,
your
honor.
i
will
attempt
to
summarize
the
contempt
petition
in
that
respect.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
that
was
the
--
he
was
in
on
the
1958
opinion
when
the
board
sought
discovery.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
petition
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
at
--
yes,
sir,
at
page
60,
i
thank
you,
the
dissent
beginning
at
67.
i
--
i
was
remarking
that
we
did
not
take
issue
with
the
proposition
that
there
was
no
obligation
to
pay
specific
sums
when
the
1952
decree
was
entered.
obviously,
those
sums
had
to
be
liquidated
before
there
was
the
duty
to
pay.
our
point
is
that
it
does
not
follow
that
because
there
was
no
immediate
obligation
to
pay
that
the
company
was
free
to
incapacitate
itself
from
making
restitution.
we
urge
that
the
1952
decree
ordering
that
these
named
employees
be
made
whole
for
past
--
a
past
period
when
they
had
not
received
wages.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
mean
stripped
itself
of
its
assets
so
that
it
will
be
unable
to
pay
later.
i
mean
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
transferring
beyond
the
reach,
attempting
to
transfer
beyond
the
reach
of
those
entitled
to
recover.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
board
has
alleged
that
this
series
of
actions
was
a
willful,
if
not
fraudulent
scheme
to
avoid
the
satisfaction
of
this
obligation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
board
has
alleged
and
this
court
must
assume
on
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
state
of
case
that
that
it
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
that
the
respondents
deny
that
the
deena
artware
company
is
now
without
assets.
what
they
contend
is
that
the
transactions
which
the
board
says
were
fictitious
transactions,
fictitious
transfers
to
evade
the
duty
of
payment,
they
contend
were
legitimate
--
constitutes
the
satisfaction
of
legitimate
business
obligations
owing
to
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
related
corporations.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
we
prevail
in
our
contention
here,
it
will
become
the
duty
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
very
likely
i
would
suppose
through
a
special
master
whether
the
allegations
of
evasive
assignments
are
borne
out
of
proof.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
deena
artware,
yes,
that's
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
correct
and
i
think
perhaps
to
make
this
perfectly
clear,
it
might
be
best
at
this
point
for
me
to
summarize
briefly
the
allegations
in
the
board's
contempt
petition.
the
board
alleges
that
there
has
been
a
concert
of
action
by
weiner,
the
president
and
controlling
stockholder,
by
deena
products,
the
parent
company
and
by
the
various
subsidiaries
including
deena
artware
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
the
satisfaction
of
this
back
pay
obligation.
the
petition
recites
that
the
parent
corporation
has
provided
each
of
the
subsidiaries
with
raw
materials
and
supplies
and
that
it
has
also
fixed
the
prices
at
which
the
subsidiaries
would
sell
their
output
back
to
the
parent
company.
the
parent
has
kept
the
books
and
records
for
all
of
the
subsidiaries,
has
commingled
the
funds
and
property
of
the
various
corporations
and
has
managed
them
as
divisions
or
departments
of
a
single
enterprise.
it
is
alleged
further
that
following
the
institution
of
the
original
board
proceeding,
the
unfair
labor
practice
case,
artware
was
compelled
by
the
parent
company
products
to
buy
dear
and
sell
cheap.
so
that
it
would
show
losses
from
the
operations
and
products
which
show
substantial
profits
from
those
same
operations.
it
is
further
alleged
that
various
charges
were
made
on
the
books
against
deena
artware,
which,
under
normal
and
proper
accounting
practice,
should
have
been
made
against
other
of
the
corporations.
it
is
alleged
further
that
shortly
after
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
case,
products
and
weiner
caused
artware
to
cease
operations.
that
was
followed
promptly
according
to
the
board's
allegations
by
the
transfer
of
artware's
plant,
property
and
assets
to
products
ostensibly
in
satisfaction
of
notes
and
other
obligations
which
the
board
says
were
fictitious.
the
plant
and
the
physical
facilities
were
then
in
turn
assigned
to
other
subsidiaries
of
products
and
operated
thereafter
as
they
still
are
operated
today
as
a
part
of
this
family
of
enterprises
but
under
different
corporate
names.
all
of
the
relevant
transfers
and
assignments
of
assets
and
property,
according
to
the
allegations,
took
place
between
1952
when
the
first
decree
was
ordered
enforced
and
1955
when
the
court
entered
its
second
decree
affirming
the
board's
supplemental
decision
and
all
of
the
respondents,
it
is
alleged,
acted
with
full
knowledge
of
the
relevant
orders
of
the
board
and
decrees
of
the
court.
and
thus,
we
say
we
are
brought
back
to
what
seems
to
us
to
be
the
crucial
question,
namely,
whether
the
equity
decree
entered
in
1952
ordering
deena
artware
its
successors,
assigns
and
officers
to
pay
back
pay
whether
that
merely
created
an
abstract
determination
of
no
binding
of
fact
at
all
or
whether
particular
consequences
attached
immediately
to
that
order.
now,
there's
no
question,
i
take
it,
that
we
have
here
an
in
personam
equity
decree
directing
a
party
to
do
something,
in
this
case,
to
make
restitution.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
at
that
point,
there's
no
question
that
they
could
not
have
made
the
payments
because
they
didn't
know
the
exact
amount
that
would
be
involved
and
their
entire
argument
is
predicated
upon
that.
now,
what
we
challenge
is
the
contention
that
an
order
to
make
restitution
imposes
no
restraint
an
equity
court
order
to
make
restitution
imposes
no
restraint.
we
say
that
it
does
impose
a
restraint
before
the
amount
is
liquidated
in
dollars
and
cents.
suppose,
for
example,
that
a
bankruptcy
court
were
to
order
a
bankrupt
to
turn
our
assets
to
a
trustee,
i
take
it,
that
that
would
be
a
binding
obligation
before
there
were
any
accounting
or
inventory
to
determine
just
how
much
property
there
was
and
before
it
was
determined
how
much
of
it
was
statutory
exempt
property
and
how
much
nonexempt.
we
think
this
is
a
similar
situation
in
that
the
equity
decree
imposes
at
once
an
obligation
to
refrain
from
frustrating
the
manifest
purpose
of
the
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
this
case
has
the
important
difference
that
we
have
joined
the
transferees
and
hence
the
civil
contempt
remedy
is
available
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
might
well
constitute
a
case
of
criminal
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
frequently,
these
proceedings
are
rather
complicated
because
the
employer
is
entitled
to
have
offset
any
amount
which
the
employee
earned
in
other
employments
or
might
have
earned
by
diligently
seeking
equivalent
employment.
so
that
you
might
in
effect
have
a
small
administrative
lawsuit,
conceivably
have
a
small
lawsuit
before
the
board
as
to
each
of
60
odd
persons.
as
i
say
this
record
doesn't
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
--
i
think
not.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
now,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
how
many
contested
issues
there
were
here,
i
just
haven't
seen
the
board.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
i
assume
that
there
were
a
good
many
problems
in
this
case
where
it
would
not
have
taken
us
so
long.
perhaps
an
--
an
example
which
is
even
closer
than
the
bankruptcy
example
i
just
gave
is
this
court's
decision
in
mccomb
against
jacksonville
paper,
and
i
have
in
mind
the
second
jacksonville
paper
case,
the
civil
contempt
proceeding
which
is
reported
in
336
u.s.
the
court
will
recall
that
as
a
result
of
prior
litigation
in
the
first
jacksonville
paper
case,
litigation
instituted
by
the
wages
and
hours
administrator,
jacksonville
paper
had
been
enjoined
substantially
in
the
words
of
the
statute
from
paying
certain
categories
of
employees
less
than
they
would
be
entitled
to
receive
under
the
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
contempt
case,
the
second
phase
of
that
litigation,
was
instituted
on
the
ground
that
the
company
thereafter
departed
from
the
statute's
minimum
wage
and
overtime
pay
requirement
and
the
prayer
in
that
civil
contempt
proceeding
was
that
the
company
be
required
to
terminate
its
continuing
violations
and
to
purge
itself
of
the
contempt
by
paying
the
amounts
of
unpaid
wages
due
the
employees.
now,
in
that
case,
the
company's
argument
made
to
this
court
was
that
the
original
injunction
very
broadly
required
compliance
with
the
statute,
that
it
did
not
direct
or
prohibit
any
specific
act
such
as
the
payment
--
direction
of
payment
of
specific
sums.
and
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
definite
therefore
to
support
a
contempt
citation
especially
the
company
argued
where
the
district
court
had
found
that
the
respondent
was
uncertain
as
to
the
application
of
the
statute's
requirements
to
the
particular
facts
and
had
not
willfully
disobeyed
them.
now
this
court
nonetheless
held
in
that
case
that
the
absence
of
willfulness
did
not
relieve
the
respondent.
it
sufficed
the
court
said
that
respondent
there
had
taken
a
calculated
risk
and
skirted
close
to
the
line.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
no
defense
in
that
case,
that
the
injunction
merely
incorporated
the
statutory
formula
for
computing
pay,
but
failed
to
set
out
the
exact
amounts
which
be
--
would
become
due
in
particular
context
under
a
correct
construction
of
the
act.
now,
we
submit
that
if
an
injunction
to
pay
employees
in
the
future
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
it's
sufficiently
definite
to
support
a
contempt
citation
even
in
the
absence
of
willfulness
as
held
in
jacksonville
paper,
that
the
efficacy
of
this
1952
decree
cannot
be
seriously
questioned.
the
decree
here
did
not
relate
to
the
future.
it
did
not
involve
variant
or
changing
factual
situations.
its
application
couldn't
possibly
be
regarded
as
uncertain.
it
directed
that
60
odd
named
persons
be
given
back
pay
for
a
definite
past
period
during
which
they
had
suffered
the
consequences
of
discharge
and
the
decree,
according
to
the
board's
contempt
petition,
has
been
willfully
violated
throughout.
now,
there's
another
aspect
of
the
jacksonville
paper
case,
which
i'd
like
to
mention
here
and
it
brings
me
to
the
last
point
that
i
would
make.
it
was
argued
in
jacksonville
paper
that
the
administrator
was
not
authorized
to
bring
a
suit
for
compensation
on
the
employees'
behalf
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
that
the
contempt
procedure
should
not
be
used
to
reach
that
result
indirectly,
and
that
the
employers
--
the
employees
were
fully
entitled
to
bring
a
suit
on
their
own
to
collect
what
was
due
them.
in
other
words,
it
was
argued
that
that
injunction
ought
to
be
enforced
by
an
independent
proceeding
and
not
by
the
government
agency
involved.
now,
the
court
rejected
that
argument,
stating
that
the
fact
that
another
suit
might
be
instituted
to
collect
the
payments
was
immaterial.
the
court
said,
"if
the
court
is
powerless
to
require
the
prescribed
payments
to
be
made,
it
has
lost
the
most
effective
sanction
for
its
decree
and
a
premium
has
been
placed
on
violations."
now,
i
would
suggest
that
the
case
for
going
forward
with
the
contempt
proceeding
is
more
compelling
in
the
--
in
the
instant
situation.
the
employees
here
have
no
remedy
of
their
own.
under
this
statutory
scheme,
the
board
has
the
exclusive
authority
to
enforce
the
commands
of
the
act.
moreover,
the
board
in
awarding
back
pay
and
in
taking
steps
to
implement
a
back
pay
order
is
not
as
respondents
would
have
it
a
mere
collection
agency
to
be
analogized
to
a
private
creditor.
this
court
has
said
that
the
back
pay
remedy
is
one
of
the
most
important
sanctions
for
effectuating
the
public
policies
of
the
act.
we
stress
that
this
proceeding
stems
from
a
back
pay
order
of
the
board
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
ordered
enforced
and
we
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
continuing
and
the
inescapable
responsibility
to
see
to
it
that
that
decree
of
the
court
is
complied
with.
that,
of
course,
was
the
position
which
was
elaborated
by
justice
stewart
in
his
dissent
at
an
earlier
phase
of
this
litigation.
i
should
also
like
to
point
out
that
institution
of
proceedings
in
the
kentucky
courts
or
in
the
district
court
by
way
of
the
bill
in
equity
to
set
aside
transactions
in
fraud
of
creditors
cannot
be
assumed
to
be
an
equivalent
remedy.
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
enforce
its
own
decrees
through
it's
equity
authority
is
broad
and
it
is
flexible
and
the
law
fraudulent
conveyancing
of
the
states
is
certainly
not
notable
for
either
of
those
attributes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
the
decree
to
make
restitution
by
means
of
payments
of
money
to
be
sure,
but
the
--
there
--
the
court
has
ruled
time
and
again,
i
think,
that
the
court
of
appeals
acts
in
its
equity
powers
when
it
enforces
labor
board
orders
and
that
those
orders
are
enforceable
through
the
contempt
process,
which
of
course
would
not
be
so
if
they
were
not
in
the
nature
of
equity
decrees.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
not
an
ordinary
common
law
judgment.
this
a
direction
to
pay
just
as
the
same
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
as
a
direction
by
an
equity
court
sitting
under
state
law
directing
a
husband
to
pay
alimony
to
his
wife.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
would
add
all
the
cases
involving
the
obligations
of
a
fiduciary
or
a
trustee
or
a
bankrupt.
certainly
equities
powers
are
available
there
in
their
everyday
use
there.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
think
it
turns
upon
the
--
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
not
upon
the
particular
remedy.
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals'
enforcement
powers
in
relation
to
administrative
orders
of
this
kind
are
traditionally
and
have
indeed
been
exclusively
exercised
through
the
contempt
process.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
to
--
i
--
reinstatement
to
a
job
is
not
a
--
an
ordinary
common
law
judgment.
similarly
if
an
employer
is
directed
to
cease
and
desist
from
certain
practices
or
to
post
notices,
i
think
most
of
the
actions
which
are
characteristically
required
by
labor
board
cease
and
desist
orders
are
duties
of
a
kind
which
a
common
law
court
does
not
ordinarily
enforce.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
i
don't
think
this
is
an
exception
merely
because
part
of
the
remedy
is
making
them
whole
to
the
payment
of
money.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
quite
so,
and
i
--
i
think
it's
distinguishable
from
the
--
indistinguishable,
excuse
me,
from
the
reinstatement
phase
of
the
same
order.
i
would
like
--
i've
been
referring
to
the
question
of
whether
an
independent
proceeding
would
be
an
equivalent
remedy,
and
that's
just
that
proof
of
fraud
though
it
certainly
adds
force
to
the
board's
claim
that
an
adjudication
and
contempt
should
be
made
is
not
necessary
to
the
establishment
of
contempt.
i
take
it
some
form
of
avoidance
short
of
fraud
might
well
warrant
the
court's
exercise
of
its
contempt
powers
though
presumably
it
would
not
move
the
court
to
act
in
dealing
with
a
bill
to
set
aside
and
conveyance
as
in
fraud
of
creditors.
as
i
noted
at
the
outset
of
this
argument,
the
--
the
discriminatory
discharge
of
these
employees
took
place
over
10
years
ago.
the
various
weiner
enterprises
are
still
actively
and
i
take
it
prosperously
engaged
in
business,
employing
as
i
understand
it,
at
this
time,
some
600
or
more
persons.
according
to
the
board's
allegations
here,
the
deena
artware
physical
facilities
are
still
in
operation
as
an
integral
part
of
this
enterprise.
throughout
this
extended
period,
not
one
cent
of
restitution
has
been
offered
or
paid
and
it
is
high
time
we
put
it
to
the
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
determine
whether
the
decrees
of
that
court
have
not
been
systematically
fluttered.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
have
not
planned
here,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
liability
as
successors
or
assigns
flows
clearly
from
what
i've
argued
is
alleged
in
the
board's
petition,
namely,
that
these
transfers
were
willfully
made
for
the
purpose
of
evasion
and
i
think
therefore
that
essentially
that
that
is
the
--
another
way
of
approaching
the
problem
but
reaching
the
same
result.
and
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
the
court
has
that
problem
at
all
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
is
relying
upon
what
it
considers
to
be
the
relevant
propositions
of
equity
jurisprudence
generally.
and
i
think
i
can
answer
that
best
by
referring
to
the
opinion.
at
page
81
of
the
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
observed
that
according
to
the
board's
allegations,
at
least
since
19
--
december
1955,
the
date
of
the
supplemental
decree,
artware
has
been
financially
unable
to
pay
the
awards.
then
the
court
goes
on
and
says
that
inability
of
a
defense
to
a
charge
of
contempt,
civil
contempt.
then
on
page
82,
the
court
goes
on
to
consider
the
liability
of
the
company
in
these
terms.
it
says
acts
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
order
or
judgment,
referring
now
to
the
1955
order,
which
he
is
charged
with
disobeying
do
not
constitute
contempt
of
court
regardless
of
the
intentions
of
the
respondent
to
avoid
the
impact
of
an
order
or
judgment
expected
by
him
to
be
thereafter
entered.
and
so
the
court
is
saying
that
an
order
to
make
restitution
unless
it's
liquidated
in
dollars
and
cents
imposes
no
obligation
and
that
in
this
case,
when
the
order
did
become
liquidated,
the
company
had
already
dissipated
the
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right
and
our
chief
difference
was
the
court
of
appeals
is
our
proposition
which
i
had
attempted
to
present,
that
the
1952
decree
imposed
a
legal
duty
to
refrain
from
incapacitating
the
respondent
from
making
payments
later
when
the
amounts
did
in
fact
become
liquidated.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
and
i
was
suggesting
in
my
answer
to
your
honor
that
on
the
proposition
that
i've
been
arguing,
we
have
something
more.
we
have
not
only
the
relationship
but
the
allegations
of
willful
purpose
to
evade
and
of
activities
with
a
purpose
of
the
evasion.
if
we
--
in
the
light
of
the
board's
allegations
on
going
to
the
first
proposition
and
those
allegations,
it
seems
to
me,
must
be
accepted
here,
i
think
that
there's
no
need
to
reach
the
question
whether
liability
might
be
imposed
on
some
more
restricted
basis,
that
is
on
a
basis
which
would
involve
a
--
a
more
extreme
position
from
the
government's
point
of
view.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
think
with
the
--
i
would
put
it
rather
in
these
terms,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
more
difficult
position
and
the
board
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
did
not
initially
proceed
against
this
company
as
a
single
enterprise
and
i
don't
think
that
it
need
be
reached
when
the
case
is
here
on
allegations
which
must
be
assumed
correct,
allegations
which
certainly
alleged
in
unmistakable
fashion
that
there
has
been
a
willful
frustration
of
the
decree.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
you.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
patent
case,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
certainly
think
that
at
least
civil
contempt
remedy
would
be
available.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
a
civil
contempt
remedy
would
be
available.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
this
is
a
strictly
a
petition
for
civil
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
in
order
to
make
an
accounting
may
not
be
as
definite
as
this
order
was,
but
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
this
--
this
is
a
clearer
case
i
would
say.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
that
in
--
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
if
they
disposed
it
to
related
companies
pursuant
to
a
scheme
as
alleged
here
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
the
civil
contempt
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it's
a
more
difficult
case
if
it
is
a
normal
business
transaction,
but
on
our
allegations
here
we
don't
have
a
normal
business
transaction.
we
have
a
fictitious
set
of
transactions
to
evade
the
decree.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
assume
and
i
must
assume
that
the
1952
decree
imposed
certain
duties
and
that
there
were
sanctions
of
law
available
in
the
event
that
those
duties
were
not
met.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
duty
which
was
imposed
by
the
1952
decree
was
a
duty
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
acts
which
were
designed
to
defeat
the
forthcoming
decree
which
determined
the
liquidated
amounts
due.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
would
not.
the
common
law
judgment
is
not
a
--
an
in
personam
order
to
pay
money.
it's
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
--
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
common
law
of
plaintiff
has
--
has
to
take
care
of
themselves
perhaps
by
attaching
property,
perhaps
by
seeing
an
--
seeking
an
injunction
pendente
lite.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
but
this
company
was
under
an
injunction,
and
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
relying
on
the
equitable
power
of
the
court
as
embodied
in
a
particular
decree
which
in
turn
imposed
a
legally
defined
duty
to
make
named
employees
whole
and
i
say
that
that
would
impose
at
least,
and
in
minimum
it
imposed
a
duty
to
refrain
from
taking
steps
which
were
calculated
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
that
obligation
being
satisfied.
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
was
about
two
thirds
as
the
way
down,
your
honor,
that
where
the
court
observes
that
since
1955,
artware
has
been
financially
unable
to
pay
the
awards.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
not
reading
this
in
terms
of
any
criminal
contempt
problem
at
all
because
this
is
strictly
a
petition
for
civil
contempt,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
not
embodied
in
the
argument
at
all
because
we
have
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
joined
the
transferor
and
the
transferees
and
the
transferor
here,
deena
artware,
is
a
corporation
and
the
transferees
are
corporations.
the
--
one
individual
who
could
be
ordered
into
confinement
until
he
took
steps
to
see
that
the
obligation
is
satisfied
is
the
man
who
was
the
president
of
all
of
these
corporations,
the
transferee
corporations
as
well
as
the
transferor
corporation
and
the
beneficial
owner
of
all
of
these
companies.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
i'm
distinguishing
between
the
transferor
and
the
transferees.
i
think
the
sanctions
of
contempt
until
they
purge
themselves
by
making
payment
are
available
against
the
transferee
companies.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
court
has
had
cases
before
it
in
which
property
involved
in
an
equity
proceeding
was
disposed
of
in
the
course
of
the
proceeding
and
you
said
that
that
was
the
contempt
of
the
court
even
though
there
was
at
that
point
no
--
no
equity
decree
and
no
injunction
pendente
lite.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
at
least
two
cases
in
which
the
court
has
held
that
a
disposition
of
specific
property
which
was
involved
in
an
equity
proceeding
during
the
litigation
would
be
a
contempt
of
the
court.
lamb
against
cramer
in
285
u.s.
was
a
case
in
which
during
the
pendency
of
an
equity
proceeding
involving
the
right
to
specific
property,
the
defendant
transferred
a
portion
of
the
property
to
his
lawyer
in
payment
for
services.
and
this
court
held
that
the
civil
contempt
power
was
available
to
require
restitution
though
no
order
of
the
court
whatever
predated
the
transfer.
that
was
done
on
the
theory
that
that
was
--
that
transfer
constituted
misbehavior
before
the
court
or
so
near
to
the
court
as
to
obstruct
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
think
the
maryland
case
which
was
cited
in
our
brief
also
relates
to
that
one.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
seems
to
me
that
counsel
has
presented
an
entirely
different
version
of
the
fact
than
i
attempted
to
present.
this
results
from
the
fact
that
counsel
for
respondent
pleads
the
facts
set
out
in
the
answer
and
we
plead
the
facts
set
out
in
the
petition.
that
seems
like
fair
play
except
to
the
fact
that
in
the
posture
of
the
case,
as
it
comes
here,
the
allegations
of
the
petition
had
to
be
taken
as
true.
now,
for
example,
it
has
been
stated
time
and
again
that
the
government
can't
deny
that
this
indebtedness
reflected
in
a
mortgage
executed
in
1949
had
a
legitimate
basis.
well,
the
government
does
deny
it.
on
page
11,
the
government
says
in
its
petition,
“artware's
alleged
indebtedness,”
i'm
reading
from
paragraph
(k),
“to
products
for
which
the
notes,
mortgage
and
assignments
were
executed
was
not
a
true
and
valid
indebtedness
and
did
not
represent
a
true
accounting
of
transactions
between
the
companies.
it
was
not
executed
in
the
usual
course
of
business.
it
was
made
and
executed
for
the
purpose
of
the
evading
payment
of
the
sums
due
under
the
decree,
it
was
not
for
adequate
and
proper
considerations
for
value
given,”
and
so
forth.
now,
it
was
that
mortgage
which
was
foreclosed
in
1953
after
the
first
decree
has
been
executed.
now,
counsel
refers
time
and
again
to
the
proposition
you
can't
do
this
by
contempt.
well,
i
don't
know
how
an
equity
court
enforces
its
decrees
when
it's
alleged
that
there
has
been
a
failure
to
comply
with
them
except
by
the
contempt
process.
and
we're
not
asking
for
punishment,
that
word
has
been
consistently
used.
we
have
been
asking
for
the
traditional
remedy,
the
coercive
remedy
which
equity
can
give
to
assure
compliance
with
its
decree.
that
means
that
contempt
will
be
purged
by
the
mere
fact
of
payment.
now,
i
did
not
mean
to
convey
in
my
opening
that
we
don't
rely
on
the
proposition
that
the
transferees
or
assigns
or
successors.
what
i
did
mean
to
convey
was
that
i
did
not
want
to
posit
the
case
in
which
these
successors
were
purely
innocent
transferees.
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
case
was
so
much
stronger
on
the
allegations
here
which
show
that
they're
not
innocent
that
the
court
need
not
reach
more
difficult
problems
when
it
has
to
stand
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
on
the
simple
ones
in
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
government
would
still
be
entitled
to
cry
out
on
its
allegations,
the
proposition
that
this
was
a
single
enterprise
and
that
the
transferee
corporations
were
liable
to
the
order
as
well
as
the
transferor
corporation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
because
the
order
imposed
an
obligation
to
pay
upon
deena
artware,
its
officers,
successors
and
assigns
and
i
would
argue
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
scheme
or,
let
me
amend
that,
even
if
there
had
been
no
implied
restraint
against
frustration
of
the
decree
that
they
would
be
liable
if
they
received
without
adequate
consideration
assets
of
the
corporation
which
was
originally
subjected
to
the
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly,
it
is
broad
enough
to
cover
that
theory
as
well.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
catch
that
line.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
it
controls
it
and
also
that
it
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
more
than
that.
it
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
also
have
specific
allegations
it
seems
to
me
that
all
these
inter
corporate
transactions
ruled
out
by
--
without
consideration
or
value.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
agree
that
we
could
argue
it
on
the
second
theory
so
to
speak
on
one
of
two
bases.
we
could
say
it
is
all
one
that
an
integrated
enterprise
and
i
think
that's
alleged
and
we
could
also
say
that
to
the
extent
that
it
isn't
for
all
purposes
the
same
enterprise
still
they
are
successors
and
assigns
because
the
transfers
were
without
adequate
consideration
and
their
relationship
plus
the
lack
of
consideration
justifies
treating
the
transferee
as
well
as
the
transferor
as
subject
to
the
directions
of
the
order.
