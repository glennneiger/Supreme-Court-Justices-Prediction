well,
that's
the
one
(inaudible)
for
the
alimony
of
the

justice

e.
whittaker
but
they're
all
legal,
are
they
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
they
not
all
legal
when
it's
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
spritzer,
may
i
ask,
is
it,
as
cited
on
page
81
of
(inaudible)
and
that
these
two
things
were
made
(inaudible)
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
honestly
it
is.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
were
(inaudible)
1952
of
the
courts
of
appeals
(inaudible)
so
that
transfers
thereafter
made
of
that
property
which
if
it
tries
in
personam
might
--
might
also
result
in
the
citations
for
failure
to
sale
in
the
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
my
reason
for
question
is
i
consider
(inaudible)
in
an
equity
suit,
but
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
think
you
could
have
the
have.
do
you
really
think
you
could
have?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
of
levying
upon
property
claimed
to
have
been
fraudulently
transferred
in
its
sale
and
then
the
trial
of
the
issue
to
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
does
the
government
concede
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
not
to
tell
the
company
it
maybe
subjected
to
condemn
if
we
did,
isn't
that
the
legal
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
what
you
asked,
if
i
understand,
in
substantive
amount
(inaudible)
there
must
be
a
judgment
for
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
he
cannot
be
cited
or
held
in
contempt
before
(inaudible)
to
form
a
judgment
then
he
couldn't
be
barred.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
(inaudible)
all
the
factual
allegations
may
find
your
(inaudible)
that
this
is
all
one
entity
owned
by
mr.
weiner
and
they
say
but
nevertheless,
the
1952
judgment
imposed
no
decree
that
could
be
provided
and
hence
that
could
not
be
disobeyed
and
by
the
time
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
could
be
no
citation
for
contempt.
