another
form
of
stating
your
position
on
point
one.
i
understand
your
position
on
point
two
is
that
if
you
assume
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
no
contempt
obligation,
no
obligation
that
could
be
reached
by
a
contempt
was
imposed
until
the
1955
decree
that
none
consent
because
of
the
relationship
of
these
enterprises,
there
would
be
liability
here
because
of
the
relationship
of
these
corporations.
now,
that's
an
entirely
different
proposition
to
the
one
you've
been
arguing.
justice

or
in
other
words,
translating
after
you
have
more
confidence
to
your
first
position,
you
have
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
that's
a
good
answer
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
a
question?
what
if
it
has
been
within
the
power
of
the
court
or
the
board
in
apportion
to
board
orders
to
put
in
provisions
pending
determination
of
the
exact
amounts
to
the
employees
of
back
pay
(inaudible)
whether
the
company
shall
not
dispose
of
any
of
its
assets.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
have
been
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
impose
such
a
condition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
what
i
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
i'm
asking
you
is
preliminary
to
another
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
if
it
had
done
so,
could
you
have
been
punishable
--
reached
by
contempt
order
if
you
violated
that
provision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
put
this
on.
the
court
could
have
enforced
that
kind
of
an
order
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
very
definite
you're
saying
that
you're
not
to
deal
with
your
assets
pending
determination
of
the
exact
amounts
due.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
i
asked
you
that
question
because
it's
in

essence
of
