earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
it
took
the
board
three
years
to
ascertain
those
amounts
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't
material
anyway,
but
is
it
--
is
it
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
the
order
of
the
court
in
requiring
back
pay,
the
reinstatement
and
back
pay,
that
is
what
you've
said,
the
requirements
of
back
pay
isn't
a
settlement
of
a
common
law
action
but
a
means
of
effectuating
the
general
public
policy
of

before
you
get
to
the
facts,
does
it
--
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
position
whether
it
is
criminal
contempt
or
civil
contempt
that
they're
proceeding
under?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that
section
you
just
read,
is
that
a
civil
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
relationship
with
the
stock
ownership
in
these
various
companies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
wheeler,
why
--
how
can
you
say
they
don't
charge
those
things
adequately?
i
notice
on
page
5,
towards
the
bottom,
it
says
that
all
times
material
herein,
weiner
has
owned
all
the
shares
of

and
--
and
so
forth.
wiener
has
been
the
real
owner
of
products
and
the
subsidiaries.
then,
at
all
times,
material
herein,
the
officers
and
directors
of
products
and
of
the
subsidiaries
including
artware
have
been
weiner,
his

his
son
and
whoever
has
been
employed
as
weiner's
personal
office
secretary.
wiener
has
been
president

now
--now,
how
--
how
can
it
be
said
that
that
doesn't
tie
those
people
up
into
one
package
about
as
closely
as
humanly
possible
to
--
to
do
so,
so
far
as
the
effect
of
this
--
this
order
whatever
it
may
be
goes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
is
that
a
conclusion
where

has
directed
the
business,
weiner
is
a
president,
owns
all
of
the
stock
and
that

has
handled
all
of
the
financial
and
business
operations
for

are
those
all
conclusions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
statements
of
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
poses
--
it
poses
the
fact
that
he
owns
all
of
stocks
would
be
a
fact
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren

know
but
we're
talking
about
the
allegation.
chief
justice
earl
warren

might
--
none
of
them
might
be
true
so
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
far
as
i
know.
chief
justice

what
they're
asking
for
is
a
hearing
on

on
these
allegations.
