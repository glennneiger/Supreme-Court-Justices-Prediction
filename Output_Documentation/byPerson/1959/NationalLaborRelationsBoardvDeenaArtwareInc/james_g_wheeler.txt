mr.
james
g.
wheeler
may
it
please
the
court?
when
i
refer
to
the
federal
statute
which
controls
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
contempt,
it
--
it
may
appear
that
we
are
behind
a
single
shield
which
limits
the
jurisdiction
or
the
authority
of
the
court.
i
want
to
refer
to
that
first
because
we
do
rely
on
it,
we
do
emphasize
it,
and
we
think
it
completely
disposes
of
the
issues
on
this
appeal.
at
the
same
time,
i'm
unwilling
to
rest
behind
the
statement
of
counsel
without
making
my
own
statement
in
order
to
show
the
court
the
facts
as
we
see
them
which
differ
materially
on
some
essential
points
as
your
honors
will
see.
and
i
hope
you
will
permit
me
to
do
that
after
i
refer
to
the
statute
which
is
referred
to,
of
course,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
which
is
title
18,
section
401.
a
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
power
to
punish
by
fine
or
imprisonment
had
its
discretion
such
contempt
of
its
authority
and
none
other
as,
one,
misbehavior
in
the
presence
of
the
court
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i'm
reading
from
the
opinion
page
81,
your
honor.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
it
is
--
it
is
quoted
by
judge
miller,
yes,
sir,
on
page
61,
misbehavior
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
misbehavior
of
any
of
its
officers
in
their
official
transactions,
disobedience
or
resistance
to
its
lawful
writ
process,
order,
rule,
decree
or
command.
only
number
three
is
applicable
here
and
we
do
take
the
position
that
until
a
decree
is
definite,
until
it
fixes
definitely
and
accurately,
what
shall
be
done,
there
can
be
no
contempt
of
court
under
that
statute.
now,
because
that
seems
to
be
a
rather
cold
and
technical
position,
i
hope
the
court
will
bear
with
me
and
let
me
tell
you
something
about
the
background
and
the
facts
which
lead
up
to
this
situation.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
criminal
contempt
has
never
been
suggested
to
me
and
i
haven't
given
thought
to
an
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
civil
contempt,
sir.
i
--
i
assume.
it
perhaps,
might
be
applicable
to
both.
it's
an
old
statute
though
its
terminology
has
slightly
changed.
i
remember
the
earliest
case
i
found
on
it
was
in
1896
that's
cited
in
--
in
the
opinion
and
in
briefs
where
a
party
cut
some
timber
on
land
which
was
directly
violative
of
the
spirit
of
the
proceeding
which
was
an
ejectment
and
yet,
there
had
been
no
order
entered,
the
court
attempted
nunc
pro
tunc
to
enter
an
order
and
it
was
--
and
it
was
disallowed
on
appeal.
it
was
stated
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
punish
him
for
contempt
under
that
statute.
so
our
position
is
--
i
--
i
can't
answer
the
court's
question
as
to
whether
it's
civil
or
criminal,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i've
only
thought
of
it
as
a
civil
contempt
action,
which
action
was
suggested
from
the
beginning
and
debated
in
court
in
1953
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
but
if
i
may,
let
me
tell
you
something
about
the
development
of
this
controversy
and
when
it
began
and
how
it
began
because
these
dates
are
of
three
importance
and
the
court
will
see
from
the
dates
that
everything
complained
of,
if
we
dismiss
the
inference
and
the
broad
general
charges
of
bad
faith
antedated
not
only
the
1955
decree,
the
only
decree
fixing
any
amount,
but
also
the
1952
decree,
the
first
decree
affirming
the
ruling
of
the
board.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
would
it
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
it
did
not
do
so.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
the
question
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
presumably
it
could
do
so.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
if
you
have
violated
an
order
of
court
which
was
as
indefinite
as
that,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
be
punished
for
contempt.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
don't
whether
the
court
could
have
enforced
that
kind
of
an
order.
it's
indefinite.
it
takes
us
nothing.
it
would
be
a
freeze
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well
it
--
your
honor's
question
reminds
me
of
one
judge
miller
asked
me
when
we
were
arguing
these
cases
on
appeal.
and
we
had
a
ruling
of
the
district
court
and
a
verdict
of
the
jury
holding
that
the
union
was
guilty
of
a
secondary
boycott
when
entering
the
judgment
against
the
brick
and
clay
workers
union
and
the
american
federation
of
labor
on
the
grounds
that
secondary
boycott
had
stopped
this
construction
work.
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
we
--
we
think
there's
no
question
about
what
it
did
not
imply
such
a
direction.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
no,
i
don't
know
that
i
do.
i
don't
know
that
i
do.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
it
did
not.
the
question
--
the
answer
to
the
question
is
–
it
is
moot
and
i'm
rather
unprepared
to
make
a
definite
position
as
what
the
court
could
have
done.
i
never
heard
of
it
doing
any
such
thing
and
it
did
not
do
so
here.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
no,
sir,
i
won't
go
that
far.
i'm
talking
about
a
labor
board
case
where
there
has
been
an
adjudication
that
back
pay
was
due
or
at
any
rate
that
the
parties
should
be
placed
in
“statute”
and
no
one
knows
what
that
back
pay
will
amount
to.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
in
this
case
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
it
would.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
oh,
we
certainly
would
have
appealed.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
and
it
would
have
been
confiscatory
and
it
would
have
been
added
at
a
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
assume
--
i
suppose
so.
i
never
had
one
made
in
any
matter
at
any
time.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
they
didn't
order.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
that
is
our
position
and
was
the
position
of
the
--
of
the
court.
the
court
took
that
position.
now,
this
--
this
corporation,
deena
artware,
was
organized
in
1946.
it
had
capital
stock
of
no
par
value,
and
it
was
organized
to
buy
a
little
pottery
which
it
bought
for
$65,000.
it
has
been
unsuccessful
up
to
that
time.
there's
lot
of
good
clay
in
western
kentucky.
and
the
purpose
of
the
purchaser
was
to
use
it
for
making
lamp
bases.
that
was
in
1946.
in
the
late
fall
of
1947,
i
believe
as
late
as
december
1947,
the
respondent
deena
artware
determined
to
enlarge
its
plant.
this
has
been
attached
to
so
many
briefs
that
i
feel
like
referring
to
it,
deena
--
judge
miller
describes
it
in
some
detail
in
his
opinion.
the
plant
was
on
the
corner
of
3rd
and
ohio
street.
behind
the
plant
was
about
a
half
a
block
owned
by
deena
artware.
there's
a
little
warehouse
on
one
end
of
it
and
it
was
the
purpose
of
deena
artware
to
construct
another
building
there
at
a
cost
of
about
$80,000
so
that
the
manufacturing
process
could
be
completed,
an
integrated
operation
right
there
in
one
block
in
this
town
and
it
would
have
conveyors
going
from
the
pottery
plant
to
the
plant
where
the
finishing
work
was
done.
that
contract
was
made
in
december
1947.
in
the
spring
of
1948,
union
negotiations
began
or
rather
the
union
began
to
get
employees
from
the
plant
and
finally,
the
brick
and
clay
workers
union
was
certified
as
a
representative
of
the
employees
of
deena
artware.
deena,
by
the
way,
is
weiner's
wife's
name
in
an
ancient
language
and
all
of
his
businesses
carry
that
name.
i
--
i
hope
it
won't
be
considered
as
some
evidence
of
integration
or
whatever
they
call
it
that
they're
all
alter
egos
because
they
bear
that
name.
deena
artware
carried
on
with
the
union
negotiations
until
this
kind
of
a
difficulty
arose.
on
may
26,
a
meeting
was
to
be
held
with
a
federal
conciliator,
gus
ferguson,
had
an
office
in
cincinnati.
they
would
meet
in
my
office
and
negotiate.
at
the
last
moment
or
few
days
before
may
26,
1948,
ferguson
wanted
to
change
the
date
to
may
28.
it
was
satisfactory
to
the
employers'
committee
consisting
of
his
manager
and
two
people
in
the
office
and
they
said
so,
and
gus
ferguson,
the
conciliator,
undertook
to
notify
the
union
representative,
a
man
named
bellew
who
lived
in
olive
hill
which
is
as
far
from
paducah
as
olive
hill
is
from
washington,
it's
at
the
other
end
of
the
state,
and
he
failed
to
notify
bellew,
i
don't
know
why,
but
at
any
rate,
on
may
26,
he
came
to
the
office
and
learned
that
the
meeting
had
been
postponed
until
may
28.
immediately
with
the
few
members
of
the
union
committee,
he
had
a
few
words
and
they
went
on
strike
at
2
o'clock
on
15
minutes
notice,
and
50
or
60
people
walked
out
enough
remained
to
operate
the
plant,
but
that
was
the
cause
and
beginning
of
the
strike.
it
--
it
was
caused
by
the
irritation
and
--
and
childish
peek
for
which
one
cannot
blame
them
too
much
after
that
long
trip
of
this
man
bellew.
well,
a
strike
immediately
brought
on
picketing
and
the
--
the
usual
difficulties
and
the
picket
line
was
extended
from
the
pottery
plant
on
the
corner
so
as
to
include
the
work
where
the
new
construction
was
going
on.
a
car
load
of
steel
could
not
be
unloaded.
the
work
couldn't
progress.
it
was
a
secondary
boycott
and
was
so
held
subsequently.
the
discontinuance
of
that
construction
work
made
it
necessary
for
deena
artware
or
for
weiner,
if
you
wish
to
put
it
that
way,
to
do
something
to
maintain
his
business
contacts.
so
the
same
plant
and
the
steel
and
the
material
were
taking
down
to
arlington
in
a
nearby
county,
and
a
plant
was
put
up
there,
and
is
still
operating
there,
and
that
is
deena
of
arlington.
in
the
meantime,
it
bought
for
$25,000
a
little
plant
at
whitlit,
which
is
down
on
the
mississippi
river.
the
plant
at
whitlit
burned
while
this
labor
trouble
was
going
on
and
was
rebuilt
and
made
into
a
modern
plant.
this
dispersal
of
operations
was
brought
about
not
by
weiner
or
these
affiliated
companies,
they
were
forced
to
do
it.
they
wanted
to
have
one
operation
at
paducah
on
one
block
so
they
could
do
it
all
there.
they
were
compelled
by
this
wrongful
secondary
boycott
to
move
this
plant
to
arlington.
and
they
did
do
the
construction
work
at
arlington
and
they
have
now
a
useless
foundation
standing
there
for
the
cost
of
which
they
obtained
a
judgment
against
this
union
and
the
american
federation
of
labor
for
about
$30,000.
that,
there
was
a
hung
jury
on
the
first
trial
and
on
the
second
trial,
that
judgment
was
obtained
in
1950.
in
the
meantime,
the
labor
relations
board
had
gotten
into
the
picture
at
a
comparatively
early
date,
and
i
don't
know
which
came
first.
i
believe
--
but
about
the
same
time
that
the
court
submitted
to
a
jury
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
secondary
boycott
and
a
judgment
was
rendered
for
deena
artware.
the
labor
board
representative
held
it
was
not
a
secondary
boycott
and
that
the
union
had
done
no
wrong
in
that
respect
and
issued
its
ruling
against
deena
artware.
so
that
brings
in
to
the
point,
i
was
going
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
that
when
i
was
arguing
this
case
and
it
came
up
july
30th,
1952,
the
two
cases
arrived
on
the
same
date
and
was
set
one
after
the
other.
one
of
them,
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
against
this
union,
the
american
federation
of
labor
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
secondary
boycott
and
the
other,
an
appeal
from
the
finding
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
based
on
the
idea
that
it
was
not
a
secondary
boycott.
and
judge
martin
leaned
over
the
bench
and
i'll
never
forget
what
he
said
because
of
the
result
that
followed.
he
said,
“brother
wheeler
do
you
ever
think
we
could
affirm
both
those
judgments
on
the
ground
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
both
of
them?”
well,
i
had
to
say
that
it
was
possible
but
i
thought
the
result
would
be
very
undesirable.
i
think
it
has
been.
they
were
affirmed.
and
the
court
explained
in
the
--
in
the
judgment
affirming
the
damaged
action
that,
of
course,
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
both
rulings
and
it
just
affirmed
them
both.
well,
the
next
step
in
this
proceeding
took
place
in
1953.
deena
artware
had
a
judgment
and
the
judgment
had
been
superseded
by
the
deposit
of
some
bonds
by
the
unions
with
the
clerk
of
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals.
deena
artware
made
an
assignment
of
the
judgment
partly
to
my
firm
in
payment
for
attorneys'
fees
for
which
we
have
a
lien
under
the
kentucky
law
anyway
and
the
balance
to
deena
products
company
as
additional
security
for
its
indebtedness
to
deena
products
company
which
was
then
secured
by
a
mortgage
executed
october
31st,
1949,
three
years
before
this
decree
was
rendered.
the
mortgage
was
thought
to
be
insufficient
to
pay
the
indebtedness
of
deena
artware
to
the
parent
company
and
so
it
assigned
this
judgment
or
a
balance
of
it.
the
board
contested
that
assignment
and
sought
to
have
it
set
aside
making
allegations
almost
identical
with
those
made
here
and
seeking
discovery
remedies
including
the
right
to
examine
books
and
to
take
depositions.
the
court
at
that
time,
in
the
trial
of
that,
i
call
it
the
1953
case,
it's
the
same
case,
made
the
statement
that
this
is
not
a
contempt
proceeding.
i
don't
know
why
they
made
that
statement
in
the
opinion,
but
it
wasn't
--
not
and
it
was
commented
on
broadly
in
argument.
the
court
pointed
out
and
more
than
intimated
in
that
hearing
that
there
were
proper
remedies
before
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
and
that
the
court
could
attack
the
wrongful
conveyance
or
mortgaging
of
properties
if
it
was
wrongful
because
when
we
filed
that
assignment
and
the
board
undertook
to
prevent
the
execution
of
the
assignment,
deena
artware
appeared
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
forma
pauperis.
the
board
knew
then
as
they
had
known
prior
thereto
that
this
little
corporation
had
no
assets.
it
was
obvious
then
in
the
1953
case
and
the
court
pointed
out
then
that
contempt
was
not
the
remedy,
there
were
other
remedies
available
to
the
board
if
there
had
been
any
wrongful
act.
in
april
of
that
year,
deena
artware
having
theretofore
employed
these
formal
striking
employees
ceased
to
do
business.
it
closed
its
doors
on
account
of
market
conditions,
all
of
which
were
well-known
to
the
board
and
it
has
never
operated
since.
in
1954,
five
years
having
elapsed
since
that
mortgage
was
made
to
deena
products
company,
it
conveyed
its
assets,
all
of
them,
to
deena
products
company
in
satisfaction
of
that
indebtedness,
and
the
indebtedness
gratefully
exceeded
the
value
of
their
assets.
and
there's
no
allegation
to
the
contrary.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
that
was
in
kentucky,
yes
sir.
all
of
this
is
kentucky,
everything
i
have
discussed.
these
--
all
of
these
corporations
except
deena
products
company
are
kentucky
corporations.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
the
stock
of
the
various
companies
is
owned,
it
hasn't
always
been
exactly
this
way,
but
it
is
owned
by
deena
products
company.
it
is
a
parent
company
so
to
speak.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
there
maybe
some
small
holdings
of
weiner
or
some
of
his
organization
but
deena
products
company
is
the
parent
company
and
owned
substantially
all
of
the
stock
of
these
companies.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes
and
judge
--
and
it
was
referred
to
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
their
opinion
citing
the
statute.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
the
court
didn't
think
so.
it
thought
that
in
order
to
investigate
such
facts
as
would
be
relevant
on
that
kind
of
an
inquiry
the
board
should
have
the
facilities
of
a
district
court
or
of
a
different
type
of
court
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
so
stated
and
that
admonition
of
the
court
was
repeated
in
two
opinions.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
the
board
would,
i
assume.
the
court
evidently
thought
that
and
i
certainly
agree
that
it
could.
perhaps
the
employees
themselves,
i
don't
know
whether
they
could
do
it
or
not,
but
certainly
the
board
could.
i
think
the
nathanson
case
has
made
that
clear.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
no
sir.
the
issue
would
be
tried
first,
i
take
it.
i
don't
think
you
could
levy
on
property.
you
might
attach
and
filed
a
lis
pendens
notice,
but
i
have
--
i
--
i
don't
think
there
could
be
any
actual
levying
until
there
had
been
an
adjudication.
in
other
words,
a
party
--
it
has
that
day
in
court,
of
course,
it
has
to
decide
that.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
don't
think
he
could
levy
before
judgments
were
rendered.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
he
could
have
after
judgment
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
--
with
an
execution.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
no,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
not
in
the
--
not
in
the
situation
of
this
kind.
i
don't
know
whether
this
such
cause
of
action
as
that
in
kentucky.
i
can't
conceive
of
kentucky
invading
the
prerogative
of
federal
preemption
in
getting
in
to
anything
like
this.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
but
this
is
a
labor
board
case.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
think
it
definitely
would.
see,
we
had
in
this
particular
–
the
way
this
thing
first
came
up,
we
had
a
judgment
obtained
in
the
federal
court
under
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
law
and
they
would
try
to
stop
the
payment
of
it
and
all
of
these
issues
were
raised
and
debated
then.
then
later,
there
began
a
series,
and
there
were
several
of
them,
of
efforts
to
examine
books
and
records
and
to
--
and
finally,
to
punish
for
contempt
the
--
this
corporation
and
the
affiliated
corporation.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
why
would
it
have
it?
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
a
court
could
assume
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
after
it
had
proved
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
after
it
had
proved,
of
course,
it
could
proceed,
but
when
there
is
a
mere
decree
to
make
parties
whole,
i
don't
think
it
can
proceed,
it
doesn't
know
what
that
amounts
to
anymore
than
the
parties
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
both,
both
sir.
in
this
particular
case,
when
they
were
talking
about
this
in
1953,
it
was
said
the
opinion
shows
it
that
the
amount
might
go
as
high
as
$100,000.
by
the
time
the
board
had
gotten
through
with
its
hearing
in
1954
and
had
disregarded
the
fact
that
we
had
a
labor
boom
in
paducah
in
1950
when
all
of
these
parties
could
have
gotten
better
employment
than
they
would
have
gotten
from
deena,
it
was
$300,000.
now,
you
can't
determine
in
advance
how
much
that's
going
to
be,
a
great
many
things
are
involved.
for
example,
in
this
--
in
this
case,
when
these
employees
were
reminded
that
the
government
was
spending
nearly
a
billion
dollars
in
that
county
building
an
atomic
energy
plant
and
that
work
was
available
for
everybody,
the
labor
board
representative
just
said,
“well
if
--
if
you
had
had
an
opportunity
to
go
back
to
work
for
deena
artware
then
you
wouldn't
have
gone,
would
you?”
“no.”
whereupon
they
disregard
these
high
wages
so
--
and
--
and
that
for
restitution
amounts
to
only
paying
them
during
a
period
of
low
wages
and
disregarding
their
earnings
during
the
period
of
high
wages.
i
refer
to
all
of
that
because
i've
been
through
it
all
to
show
that
it's
impossible
when
this
1952
decree
is
rendered
to
determine
what
the
ultimate
liability
will
be.
it
was
impossible.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
the
board
concede
it?
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
--
they
--
they
must
do
so.
they
must
concede
it.
but
they
argued
that
we
should
stand
by.
they
say
we
don't
mean
you
should
freeze
assets
but
you
should
standby
and
be
ready
to
pay.
well,
suppose
we
had
stood
by
in
1952,
july
30th,
let's
see
what
we
would
have
had
standing
behind
us.
we
would
have
a
little
plant
with
a
mortgage
on
it
for
$75,000
entered
into
three
years
before
for
an
indebtedness,
the
validity
of
which
they
dare
not
attack
because
they've
been
invited
to
do
it
and
they
won't
do
it,
we
would
have
stood
by
then
with
an
insolvent
party
already
insolvent
but
trying
to
carry
on
and
it
would
--
we've
been
exactly
in
the
same
position
we're
in
right
now.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir,
that's
the
legal
question
and
our
position
on
that
is
unequivocal,
but
i
like
to
make
a
statement
because
i
don't
like
to
carry
the
burden
of
all
of
the
charges
that
have
been
made
against
this
company
of
bad
faith
when
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
intercorporate
relationship.
they
speak
of
the
fact
that
they
make
a
joint
statement.
well,
of
course,
they
make
a
joint
statement.
sec
would
make
them
a
joint
statement
if
they're
big
enough
to
be
on
the
big
board.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
there's
no
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
there's
no
property
to
turn
over
but
i
would
say
yes.
the
court
could
not
punish
for
that
because
there
was
no
decree
for
it
to
violate.
they
may
--
it
--
it
may
have
been
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
no,
i
won't
say
anything
of
the
kind,
but
i
say
it's
not
relevant
to
this
particular
question.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
no,
sir,
that
isn't
what
we
have.
but
i
will
say
this
in
order
to
frame
your
honor's
question
in
a
little
different
manner,
if
they
had
done
that,
before
there
was
any
definite
decree
which
they
could
obey
or
disobey
a
definite
order
to
pay
money
which
they
could
obey
or
disobey,
they
could
not
be
punished
for
contempt.
they
might
be
reached
in
other
ways
but
they
could
not
be
punished
for
contempt
until
there
was
a
definite
order
which
they
could
be
in
contempt
on.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
presumably.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
oh,
no
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
no,
if
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
--
if
they
want
to
raise
that
issue,
which
they
do
not
or
never
have,
the
court
could
go
behind
it,
of
course.
yes,
sir,
certainly
it
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
we
think
not.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they
do
exactly.
i
think
they
try
to
but
i
think
in
order
to
do
that,
you
must
allege
some
facts.
you
can't
just
call
us
names
or
state
conclusions
which
reflect
on
our
honesty.
you
have
to
be
a
little
more
definite
than
that.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
and
i
don't
think
they
have
it.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
would
say
no.
of
course,
there
was
a
very
extensive
exchange
of
pleadings.
i
have
drawn
so
many
answers
and
responses
to
motions
that
--
but
--
but
they're
set
out
in
this
record
at
least
the
last
set
of
them
and
the
allegations
of
the
board
are
substantially
the
same
and
they're
repeated
and
we
have
answered
them
and
stated
the
facts,
some
of
which
i
have
stated
here
before
the
court.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
they
said
they
were
insufficient.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
that
is
the
ground.
that
is
the
ground
and
it
did
say
they
were
insufficient
on
that
ground.
well,
our
position
briefly
stated
and
i
don't
know
that
i
need
label
to
point
because
i
think
we
have
covered
it
in
briefs
and
i
think
we've
covered
it
in
our
responses
to
the
motions.
first,
there's
no
question
here
before
the
court
on
inspection
or
that
kind
of
thing.
that
wasn't
tendered
on
the
petition
for
certiorari.
that
question
is
not
here.
the
question
referred
to
on
which
mr.
justice
stewart
dissented
is
not
here.
it's
solely
a
question
of
contempt
and
this
argument
today
eliminates
from
that
even
the
question
of
contempt
on
the
part
of
the
subsidiaries
or
affiliated
companies.
well,
that's
not
stressed
and
it
appears
to
me
that
it
has
been
abandoned.
that
apparently,
equity
--
the
--
the
allegations
do
not
permit
a
consideration
of
those
charges
under
equity
rule
65
because
there
was
no
concerted
action
by
the
subsidiaries
or
affiliated
companies
with
deena
artware
and
is
not
charged
that
there
was.
they
speak
of
siphoning
of
assets.
there
were
no
assets
to
siphon
off
since
october
1949,
three
years
before
the
first
decree
and
eight
years
before
the
last
decree.
so
it
appears
to
us
that
we
need
not
consider
whether
the
affiliated
corporations
derived
any
responsibility
for
contempt
from
deena
artware
unless
we
find
that
deena
artware
was
itself
guilty
of
contempt,
which
it
is
admitted
it
could
not
have
been
since
december
1955
when
the
final
definite
decree
was
entered.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes
sir,
correct
and
that
is
the
substance
of
our
argument
in
the
basis
of
our
position.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
i
say
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
don't
--
it
appears
to
be
tended
on
their
petition
for
certiorari.
it
is
referred
to
in
briefs
and
we've
submitted
our
argument
and
they've
submitted
theirs.
i
can't
say
it
isn't
tended.
i'm
referring
to
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
i
--
i
expressly
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
no,
sir,
i
expressed
it
inaccurately.
i
mean
the
counsel
in
presenting
his
argument
did
not
stress
it
and
didn't
bring
it
up
at
all
until
he
was
questioned
from
the
bench
as
to
whether
he
was
abandoning
that.
i
think
we've
covered
it
in
briefs.
and
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
showing
or
no
allegation
of
such
concert
of
action
as
would
make
these
subsidiaries
liable
in
any
respect
under
the
equity
rule
which
is
the
only
--
only
rule
under
which
they
could
be
responsible
for
anything
that's
charged
here.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
all
right,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
because
the
--
the
only
thing
that
could
bring
into
the
(inaudible)
the
court's
order
in
this
case
would
be
such
connection
between
them
as
would
make
them
liable
for
a
--
a
failure
to
perform
the
decree
under
rule
65,
that
is,
concert
of
action
with
the
party
charge,
no
charge
has
ever
been
made
against
these
affiliated
corporations.
one
of
them,
deena
products
company,
i
doubt
if
it's
before
the
court
of
the
sixth
circuit,
hadn't
done
business
in
the
sixth
circuit
for
five
years.
i
doubt
if
it's
before
that
court
and
we
made
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
but
it's
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
they
might
--
they
might
seek
it
into
some
kind
of
a
proceeding
but
they
--
they
could
not,
in
this
proceeding,
through
the
medium
of
contempt
engaged
in
a
punitive
expedition
against
these
little
companies
and
undertake
to
get
it
that
way.
the
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
don't
know
that
i
catch
full
import
of
your
honor's
question
and
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
--
answer
it
inaptly.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
in
this
proceeding,
yes,
because
that's
the
way
they
are
going.
we
tried
--
the
courts
tried
to
make
them
proceed
otherwise
but
they
won't
do
it.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
i'm
saying
that
--
well,
we
cited
on
page
23
of
our
brief
these
words
in
a
second
circuit
case
of
judge
hand.
in
allowing
these
words,
successors
and
assigns
to
stand,
we
wish
to
make
it
clear
however
that
we
do
not
hold
that
a
successor
or
an
assign
will
be
in
contempt
of
our
order
if
it
should
even
after
notice
of
the
order,
but
without
participating
with
the
respondent
in
any
disobedience
of
it,
do
exactly
those
things
which
the
order
forbids.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
it
has
been
so
held,
but
i
think
we've
taken
care
of
that
in
the
latter
part
of
our
brief
by
showing
that
there
is
no
statement
which
would
bring
them
within
the
class
of
successors
and
assigns
here.
all
the
world
that
this
is,
is
just
simply
using
the
corporate
form
to
engage
in
business.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
yes,
it
is
questioned.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
in
a
proper
proceeding,
but
not
by
contempt
against
one
or
tempted
to
be
enforced
against
others
who
are
not
even
parties
to
the
proceedings
from
which
the
contempt
arises.
that's
our
--
that's
our
position.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
all
right,
sir,
strip
of
the
conclusions,
it
just
simply
means
that
here
is
a
parent
corporation
with
several
subsidiaries
and
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
some
of
them
are.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
most
of
them.
in
fact,
the
statement
that
he's
president
and
treasurer
go
on
true
as
the
statement
of
fact.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
it
isn't
true.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
it
isn't
true,
but
it
is
--
it's
not
a
conclusion.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
understand.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
understand.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
but
these
are
kentucky
corporations.
they
have
board
of
directors.
weiner
and
products
can't
control
them.
we
have
the
facts
set
out
elsewhere
in
more
detail
which
bears
out
what
i
say
when
i
say
that's
a
mere
statement
of
conclusions
of
bad
faith.
the
facts
are
developed
throughout
the
statements.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
sir?
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
i
--
well,
i
have
my
ideas
about
it.
they
don't
need
any
evidence.
we've
been
over
this
thing.
there's
a
record
filed
in
this
court.
they're
surely
familiar
with
these
facts.
the
allegations
show
how
well
posted
they
are.
they
don't
need
any
evidence
but
that's
not
before
this
court
now.
the
only
thing
before
us
--
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
well,
they
maybe
able
to
piece
the
corporate
veil
is
they
want
to
try
it.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
no,
i
[laughter]
--
maybe,
your
honor,
but
that
isn't
what
is
here.
what
is
here
is
the
question
of
contempt,
and
that's
all.
mr.
james
g.
wheeler
most
of
--
most
of
that
i
go
along
with,
but
i
do
say
that
when
in
this
series
of
statements
shot
through
with
conclusions
of
bad
faith,
they
show
that
they
knew
that
a
mortgage
was
executed
in
1939,
three
years
before
the
first
decree
and
six
or
seven
years
before
the
second
decree
that
that
fact
is
just
as
binding
on
them
as
these
statements
that
they
cite
from
the
assets
at
a
time
when
their
own
statement
show
there
are
no
assets
to
siphon
all.
and
they
couldn't
have
done
it,
because
they
knew
the
facts
and
when
it's
taken
as
a
whole,
now,
taking
the
--
the
allegations
afford
to
by
the
chief
justice
just
set
out
taken
out
of
context,
it
would
appeal
that
they
had
made
charges
that
he
was
--
that
weiner
had
or
wrongfully
controlled
if
--
all
of
these
corporations.
but
when
you
take
all
of
the
allegations
and
read
the
thing
from
beginning
to
end,
you
find
that
nothing
after
1952
could
have
changed
the
situation
in
any
respect.
now,
in
--
in
conclusion,
unless
there's
something
further
that
court
may
suggest
to
me,
i
want
to
say
that
judge
miller
had
tried
this
controversy
seven
times,
and
i
think
judge
martin
was
waiting.
it's
been
up
there
before
that
court
so
long
that
after
the
last
one
came
up,
one
member
of
the
court
said,
“well,
we've
gotten
rid
of
old
deena
at
last”,
but
he
was
wrong.
we
hadn't
gotten
rid
of
old
deena
at
last,
but
i
refer
to
that
now
flippantly
to
show
that
that
court
and
the
members
of
that
court
were
thoroughly
familiar
with
this
matter,
it's
been
before
them
so
many
times.
and
judge
miller's
final
opinion
from
which
this
appeal
is
prosecuted
is
not
only
a
review
of
facts,
but
we
think
a
very
thorough
consideration
of
all
of
the
issues
before
that
court
and
i
refer
to
it
because
i
know
it
will
be
studied
by
this
court
as
a
more
effective
and
more
complete
statement
of
facts
from
an
impartial
court
than
we
could
set
out
in
our
briefs
up
here.
