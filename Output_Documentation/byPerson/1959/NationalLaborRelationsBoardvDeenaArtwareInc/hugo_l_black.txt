the

reaches
the
conclusion
that
a

valid,
orders
an

they
ordered
the
accounting
at
the

they
fix
an
amount
of
the
defendant
whoever

could
they
get
him
for
contempt
on
that?

what?

it
addresses
the

you're
arguing
here,

it
not?

i

the

i
propose
here.

is
there
any

your

your
position
could
carry
you
to
the
point,
wouldn't
it,
as
i
was
thinking
it's
wrong
that
these
people
disposes
their
properties
to
make
it
sure
that
they
did
it

they
didn't

justice

would
that
add
anything
to
the
liability
for
the

fact

does
it
make
any

whether
the

is
fictitiously

not?
justice

you
base
that
enforcement
of
facts
that
it's
an
equity.

it
would
not
apply
common

it?

the

question
because
you
read
first
at

in

i
have
a
little
different
question.
what
was
on
page

that
you
read?
justice

and
i
suppose
--
suppose
i
(inaudible)
through
since
1955
(inaudible)
they've
tried
to
collect,
tried
to
kept
the
failing
(inaudible)
but
they
didn't
have
the
money.
justice

are
you
reading
that
on
the
basis
that
they
could
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
don't
care
about
the
differences
that
you
mean.
what
i'm
talking
--
asking
you,
does
your
argument,
if
we
accept
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
it
worthwhile
to
say
that
whatever
kind
of
contempt
you
cause,
the
man
can
be
put
in
jail
failing
that
they
want,
solely
because
he
failed
to
pay
money
to
get
everything
done,
solely
because
he
fails
to
pay
money
and
he
doesn't
have
to.
justice

that
--
that's
not
embodied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo

where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
opinion
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
never
heard
of
a
court
ordering
that
pending
the
hearing,
litigant
party
should
not
dispose
of
their
assets?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
wouldn't
it
be
very
definite
for
it
to
say
you
--
you
might
appeal
and
have
it
reverse,
wouldn't
it
be
a
very
definite
statement
if
the
court
were
to
say
in
our
opinion
to
hear
it
pending
upon
judgment
fixing
of
the
amount.
we
take
it's
necessary
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
litigant
that
the
defendant
does
not
transfer
any
of
his
assets,
would
not
that
have
been
a
definite
order
telling
him
not
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
would
either
had
to
obey
or
--
or
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sure
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
would
be
an
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
would
make
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
such
orders
are
sometimes
made
of,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suppose
your
argument
was
quite
a
little
different
to
that,
since
here,
they
didn't
order
such
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
is
--
it's
no
definite
so
far
as
--
i
--
maybe
it
would
be
wrong
but
it's
so
indefinite
that
it
shouldn't
be
construed
as
justifying
punishment
on
the
man
who
did
something
which
it
did
not
clearly
prohibit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
in
kentucky?
justice

does
the
law
is
as
broad
as
the
law
of
kentucky
authorizing
full
action
to
set
aside
or
met
with
such
kind
of
--
justice
hugo
l.

--
fraudulence?
justice
hugo

if
that's
true,
would
the
court
of
equities
which
is
imposing
the
board
decree
have
power
at
the

time?
justice

would
have
the
right

go
into
court?
justice

(inaudible)
up
federal

the
tax
set
as
fraudulent.
justice

i
would
suppose

maybe
i'm
wrong,
i
would
suppose
maybe
the
sheriff
could
levy
or
the
officer
but
it
should
--
it'd
read
to
be
levied
on
the
wrong
property.
justice

well
--
justice

black
i
meant
--

black
the
--
the
court
though,
they
don't
get
to
reach
the
levy
stage
or
the
execution
stage
but
you
have
a
situation
where
you
know
a
judgment
can
be
rendered
or
think
so
and
an
equity
is
--
valid
equity
is
invoked
to
conserve
the
assets
so
that
they
would
not
be
dissipated.
does
cause

is
introduced?
justice

it

not?
justice

well,
what
you
are
saying

what
you
are

that
if
anything
like
that
could
be
done

has
to
be
done
by
the
federal

justice

why
the

do
you
think
it

it
would

do
you
think
it
to
be
lacking
in
power
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
cease
and
desist
which
is
carried
(voice

--
justice

i
understand
that
but
suppose
it
had
proved
in
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
courts
do
that
something
bad
is
to
happen
and
it
issued
an
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
basis
that
didn't
know
what
it
amounts
to
or
it
would
be
on
the
basis
that
there
would
be
no
proper
showing
to
establish
on
that
it
was
necessary
for
a
court
of
equity
to
do
that
in
order
to
prevent
the
future
frustration
of
this
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that
statement
because
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand.
suppose
the
evidence
shows
that
this
transfer
had
been
made
for
the
purposes,
before
him,
of
evading
any
judgment
it
has.
suppose
it
was
(inaudible)
by
the
evidence,
it
was
not
an
artificial,
fictitious,
it
didn't
have
any
real
genuine
(inaudible),
would
you
then
say
that
the
court
would
be
without
power
to
force
you
to
turn
over
that
property
even
though
--
even
though
it
knew
that
it's
fictitious?
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
official
transaction
and
have
--
really
hadn't
been
any
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
a
different
question.
but
there
is
a
decree,
we'll
say,
in
1952
which
said,
“you
got
to
obey,
if
you
--
you
got
to
pay
these
people
something,”
we
don't
know
exactly
what.
will
you
that
that
kind
and
to
get
billion
and
go
through
some
artificial
hocus-pocus,
fictitious
transactions
which
doesn't
really
amount
to
a
transfer,
then
the
court
comes
along
and
says
later,
“you
turn
this
over.
it's
fraudulent,
you
still
have
this
and
it's
still
yours.”
you
mean
to
say
that
the
court
couldn't
enforce
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that's
not
what
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
got
an
order
you
say
then,
you
got
an
order
and
you
want
to
go
back
behind
to
show
that
they
have
this
property,
it's
artificial
transfer
back
there
and
they
have
it
now,
order
it
to
pay
it,
couldn't
the
court
get
them
for
contempt
if
it
didn't
turn
it
over.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
saying,
are
you,
that
they
could
--
couldn't
look
behind
those
transactions
to
see
if
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
had
been
any
definite
legitimate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
transfer
of
the
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
to
their
second
opinion?
i
understand
that
it
doesn't
interpret
issue
it
seems
to
me
that
pretty
nearly
kind
of
this
issue
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
respondents
are
integral
part
of
a
single
enterprise
and
as
such
were
and
are
answerable
to
the
court's
decree
which
explicitly
rise
against
deena
artware
and
its
officers,
agents,
successors
and
assigns,
whether
respondents
or
any
of
them
are
answerable
to
the
supplementary
decree
as
officers,
agents,
successors
and
assigns.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
not
tender
the
issue
or
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
misunderstood
you
to
say
it
was
not
tendered.
justice
hugo

black
i
misunderstood
you,
i'm
sure.
justice

suppose
they
could
establish
(inaudible)

the

i'm
asking
you
the
question,
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i'm
not
--
don't
understand
it.
suppose
they
could
have
tell
you
as
they
say,
these
are
really
part
of
one
integrated
company
all
with
the
same
interest
and
all
allowed
at
the
same
thing
of
judgment
might
be
a
liberal
reading
of
what
they
try
to
(inaudible)
raise
it.
suppose
they
could
establish
it,
why
would
they
--
and
that
was
the
issue
they
would
try,
why
would
they
not
be
entitled
to
the
information
which
they
decide
on
that
issue?
and
that's
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
what
i
am
getting
at,
suppose
the
court
was
wholly
right
and
wholly
and
that
decree
or
whatever
the
basis
is
too
indefinite
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
get
him
for
contempt
for
paying
it
insofar
as
payment
of
the
thing
that
was
concerned,
but
that
on
that
--
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
some
issue
tendered
as
to
whether
these
companies
were
really
operating
as
one
so
that
whatever
was
going
--
done
by
one
is
done
by
all
and
that
the
court
now
wanted
to
try
that
out
in
order
to
catch
by
inference
to
those
fines.
would
that
not
--
would
the
information
they
seek
not
be
required
and
would
--
would
it
not
be
valid
to
seek
(inaudible)
on
that
inference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
we
have
to
consider
in
the
framework
of
contempt
not
in
the
framework
in
a
case
where
there's
an
effort
ascertained
whether
or
not
there
has
been
some
artificial
transaction.
some
have
taken
place
between,
apparently
between
different
people
when
in
fact
the
old
ones
working
to
the
same
end
and
only
the
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
--
the
import
of
it
is
this.
the
--
do
you
say
that
this
has
to
be
considered,
the
permissibility
of
this
evidence
on
the
basis
of
contempt
and
nothing
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that's
--
then
i
suppose
that
that's
true,
you're
saying
in
what
--
the
second
issue
should
be
raised
in
a
way
of
some
kind
of
a
bill
to
protect
the
equity
as
a
preliminary
to
a
definite
order
that
would
--
he
might
find
that'd
be
made
by
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that's
what
i
maybe
--
maybe
the
government
is
not
mentioning
it
but
looks
to
me
like
what
they're
claiming
on
their
second
question
(inaudible)
or
integral
parts
of
the
single
entity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
(inaudible)
we're
not
answering
it
to
the
court's
decrees
which
explicit
toward
against
deena
artware
and
its
officers,
agents,
successors
and
assigns.
and
i
believe
we
did
hold
it
in
one
case
some
years
ago,
did
we
not,
that
such
a
decree
was
binding
on
the
successors
and
assigns?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
that
might
be
true
if
it
questions
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
a
right
to
test
it
out,
do
they
not,
as
to
follow
that
is
the
truth
in
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they're
asking
for
the
evidence
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they're
asking
for
the
evidence
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
--
what
you
seem
to
be
saying
is
that
they
cannot
do
what
is
generally
called
if
the
corporate
fails
even
though
there
are
sufficient
allegations
to
justify
in
order
to
show
that
all
that's
being
done
is
really
on
the
one
mind
and
one
control
and
one
(inaudible)
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
much
think
--
think
why
that
should
that
occur
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
does
that
mean
this?
let's
suppose,
and
i
just
want
to
agree
with
the
courts
below
that
to
this
extent
that
this
order
did
not
forbid
the
transfer
of
their
assets
with
sufficient
specificity
to
justify
him
under
kept
decree
or
whatever
you
call
it
(inaudible)
on
that
basis.
let's
suppose
this,
does
that
mean
that
that
would
end
the
case
or
is
your
complaint
here
sufficient
to
justify
you
in
having
a
hearing
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
court
could
amend
upon
that
this
property
has
been
conveyed
and
has
really
been
no
conveyors
to
owe
one
person
and
that
it
then
issues
an
order
directed
them
to
turn
it
over.
