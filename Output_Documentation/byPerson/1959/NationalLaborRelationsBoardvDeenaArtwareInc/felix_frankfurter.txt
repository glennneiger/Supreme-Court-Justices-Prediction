that's

right
after
it
appears
that
the

in
its

in
its
last
motion
and
last
proceeding
and
now
through
you
asserts
that
the

incapacitated

to
reach
the

is
that

you

suppose
there
had
been

this
that
this

so
that

suppose
it

it

all
â€“

would
there
be
a
difference?
of
course,
you
couldn't
then
ask
for
a
civil
content
on
the
assumption
that

that
he's
physically
and
financially
unable
to
get
himself
out
of
jail
if
he
were
committed
to
it.
but
would
that
not
be,
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice

in
the
days
that
i've
put,
would
you
think
that

that
the

so
when
equity,

finds
it

does
that

action
though

justice

well,
isn't
the
order
of
--
justice

mr.
spritzer,
is
it
necessary
or
appropriate
for
us
to
consider
whether
the
court
of
appeals
did
not,
in
fact,
construe
its
own
decree,
scope
of
the
decrees,
the
legal
incidence
of
it,
and
therefore,
if
that
be
so,
we
have
a
question
of
sitting
in
judgment
upon
the
framer
of
the
decree's
interpretation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
your
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
whereas
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
they
do
not
deny
that
in
1952,
there
was
an
adjudication
of
violation
of
a
statute
which
required
back
pay
payments,
that
the
amount
of
those
payments
were
to
be
settled
in
the
future
the
amount
--
they
were
not
liquidated,
this
was
an
unliquidated
obligation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
there
was
an
adjudication
--
but
there
was
an
unliquidated
obligation
as
between
the
time
of
that
generalized,
that's
an
appropriate
phrase,
decreeing
1952
and
the
affirmance
of
the
liquidation
of
the
amount
in
1955
be
naturally
all
the
acts
now
complained
of
as
disabling
the
respondent
of
obeying
the
court
are
taking
place
and
that
the
duty
of
obedience
in
particularity
didn't
arise
until
after
all
these
transactions
were
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
think
that
--
don't
say
it's
tendered
that
issue
--
can
there
--
can
there
be
contempt
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
they
say
that
they
ask
for
a
commitment
civil
contempt,
namely,
to
carry
out
the
order
of
1952
rendered
liquid

rendered
liquidated
by
1955
because
not
to

transaction
but
that
there
was
a
calculated
design
purposeful
plan
executed
to
render

the

when
just
went
time.
isn't
that
what
they
said
the
contempt
case?
i'm
not

there's
any

there's

justice

well,
that
isn't
the
ground
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
isn't
the
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
went
if
they'd
said
you
didn't
ask
for
a
bill
of
particulars,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
we'll
leave
him
a
civil
contempt
as
a
serious
matter.
and
before
i
ask
people
to
perform
or
on
the
alternative
go
to
jail
to
see
to
if
the
phrase
runs
with
their
pockets
to
get
out
of
it,
you
must
be
more
specific
if
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
have
my
great
doubts
whether
this
court
would
think
it
was
this
business
to
--
to
tell
yes,
there
enough.
that
was
the
question
of
pleading.
that
isn't
what
the
case
is
about,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
didn't
say
they're
insufficient
and
you
make
them
more
ample,
more
detailed,
more
particular
for
us
to
act
on,
the
court
didn't
do
that,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
out
of
legal
ground,
namely,
that
all
that
took
place
--
took
place
prior
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
act
of
the
controverted
items
of
1955
where
the
indefinite
as
the
1952,
they're
definite.
that's
