that
has
been
traditionally
the
two
of
denationalization
proceedings,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i'm
not
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
wrong
if
he
just
stays
abroad
long
enough?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
factor
can
hardly
be
taken
into
account
down
the
validity
of
the
statute
unless
you
argue
that
the
statute
is
to
be
cut
down
to
a
dual
nationality
case
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
so,
you
put
it
the
other
way
around.
the
existence
of
dual
national
as
potential
people
who
rid
themselves
with
obligations
to
this
country
might
well
have
been
inducing
cause
of
the
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
relation
with
mexico
have
not
always
been
very
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
long
ago
--
not
too
long
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
brings
out
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
know
that?
you're
forecasting
the
future,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
of
us
that
did
they
say
grasping
measures
against
the
prisoner
didn't
take
away
his
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
loyalty
declared
or
mediocrity
the
gentleman
that
we
can
see
and
well
the
(inaudible)
special
statute
to
impose
very
heavy
consequence
not
that
(inaudible)
can
do
with
that
prohibits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
held
him
--
held
himself
from
the
obligations
of
citizenship
or
his
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
a
misjudgment
--
the
congress
will
make
a
misjudgment
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
remedy
in
this
proposal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
saying
that
every
remedy
as
supposed
is
constitutionally
valid.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
we
don't
sit
here
and
debate
whether
congress
is
wise
or
not.
some
of
us
think
that
a
lot
measures
are
ineffective
and
self
defeat.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
just
mine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
avail
yourself
of
that
in
unity
but
in
order
of
(inaudible)
an
obligation
to
another
story
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
speaking
of
this
case
has
been
a
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
deny
that
a
person
who
has
dual
citizenship
has
a
class
is
then
the
difference
proper
to
the
congress
putting
aside
all
the
other
arguments?
would
you
deny
that
--
that
congress
can
deal
with
dual
citizens
as
a
class
if
it
was
not
a
dual
citizen
because
a
likely
order
of
a
dual
citizen
availing
himself,
(inaudible)
in
relation
to
the
other
country
is
greater
than
that
of
a
federation
that's
better
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
deny
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
i
made
myself
clear.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
it
would
--
i
couldn't
even
touch
the
broader
question
whether
the
constitution
would
denaturalize
any
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
starting
with
the
power,
could
it
differentiate,
could
it
--
assuming
the
power
was
redefined
et
cetera,
could
it
they
we
will
only
be
who
was
dual
citizenship,
people
who
have
dual
nationalities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
a
practical
fact,
a
fellow
who
is
also
a
mexican
citizen
has
an
easier
haven
or
refuge
in
mexico
than
one
who
hasn't
the
mexican
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
that
reciting
the
practicalities
on
which
congress
legislates
all
the
time
to
a
specific
case
may
not
present
the
advantage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
he
--
if
he
makes
that
argument,
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
on
your
prior
argument
that
(inaudible)
consider
whether
there
is
any
potentiality
of
deterrent
but
it
doesn't
say
the
gathering,
the
assembling
of
an
army
is
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
because
it's
intended
to
the
term
having
just
established
that
there
is
no
deterrent
element
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
--
whole
argument
indicates
the
whole
problem
of
deterrent
namely
real
people
who
are
about
to
do
something
that
is
deemed
totally
undesirable
check
in
that
preference
by
remembering
the
consequence
on
which
it
is
based
on.
