mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
declaratory
judgment
action
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
federal
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
it
comes
to
this
court
on
direct
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.,
united
states
code
1252
which
provides
for
a
direct
appeal
in
a
civil
proceeding
involving
the
government
when
a
district
court
has
held
invalid
a
statute
of
congress,
and
the
statute
of
congress
which
the
district
court
here
invalidated
is
section
401
(j)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
providing
for
loss
of
nationality
by
an
american
who
has
gone
abroad
to
evade
the
draft.
both
the
issue
and
the
case
have
been
here
before.
the
case
was
here
at
the
same
time
as
the
expatriation
cases
which
were
decided
two
terms
ago
and
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
in
the
light
of
one
of
those
cases,
then
decided.
the
issue
itself
was
involved
as
presented
by
the
parties
in
the
perez
case,
but
was
not
decided
by
the
court.
the
only
issue
in
this
case,
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
is
the
validity
of
the
statute.
there
are
no
questions
of
fact
involved,
as
i
shall
point
out,
they
were
stipulated
below.
so
the
only
issue
is
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
statute.
as
i
shall
also
point
out
a
little
more
in
detail
later,
this
particular
section
of
the
nationality
act
of
1944,
though
it
was
before
the
court
two
terms
ago,
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
court
and
therefore,
the
issue
is
now
open
for
the
court
to
decide.
i
should
also
mention
at
this
point
i
think
that
this
involves
the
nationality
act
of
1940
which
has
since
of
course
been
superseded
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
as
a
comparable
provision
in
--
in
the
later
act,
but
it
--
it
contains
somewhat
different
provisions
and
so
i
--
i'd
want
to
say
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
section
401
(j)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940.
the
facts
were
undisputed
and
were
stipulated
in
the
court
below.
the
appellee
was
born
in
the
united
states
in
1922
and
of
course
was
an
american
citizen
at
birth.
he
was
also
at
birth
and
has
at
all
time
since
been
a
citizen
of
the
republic
of
mexico.
it
is
agreed
that
in
19
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
from
birth.
apparently,
because
his
parents
were
american
nationals,
that
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
assume
that's
so.
after
the
selective
service
act
was
passed,
he
registered
for
it,
but
before
he
was
called
to
service,
i
believe,
in
1942,
he
went
to
mexico.
now,
he
has
stipulated
that
the
sole
purpose
of
his
going
to
mexico
was
to
evade
the
draft
and
he
has
stipulated
that
the
sole
purpose
of
his
remaining
in
mexico,
which
was
until
november
1,
1946
was
to
avoid
the
draft.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
since
he
was
born
in
--
in
1922
and
he
went
to
mexico
in
1942,
he
was
20
at
the
time.
he
remained
in
mexico
for
four
years
until
november
1946,
after
the
close
of
hostilities
in
the
--
in
world
war
ii.
on
his
--
he
then
returned
to
this
country.
he
was
then
--
charges
were
then
brought
against
him
for
draft
evasion
in
california,
he
pleaded
guilty,
was
sentenced
to
a
year
and
a
day
which
i
believed
he
has
served.
the
immigration
service
then
brought
deportation
proceedings
against
him
on
the
ground
that
he
had
expatriated
himself
under
section
401
(j)
by
going
to
and
remaining
in
mexico
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft
and
an
order
of
deportation
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
in
the
sense
that
he
consciously
did
renounce.
all
i
mean
by
that
is
he
voluntarily
went
to
mexico
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
evading
the
draft.
that
is
a
stipulated
fact
which
no
one
disagrees.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
under
the
nationality
act
of
1940
it
says,
you
can
renounce
from
the
year
--
age
18
up.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'd
like
to
point
out
at
this
moment,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
i
don't
think
the
issue
of
his
age
is
in
the
case
at
all.
first,
that
it
wasn't
raised
and
second,
because
the
section
401
(j)
was
only
passed
in
september
1944.
and
the
--
it
was
his
remaining
abroad
after
that
time
which
constituted
his
expatriation
and
by
that
time
he
was
21.
so,
in
this
case,
in
a
previous
case,
there
was
that
issue
involved
but
in
this
case
there
is
no
such
issue.
he
--
as
i
was
saying,
the
deportation
proceeding
was
brought
against
him
and
an
order
of
deportation
was
issued.
apparently,
he
then
left
voluntary
to
return
to
mexico
under
that
order
of
deportation.
sometime
in
1952,
he
returned
to
the
united
states,
apparently
claiming
to
be
an
american
citizen
and
after
his
return
in
1952,
another
deportation
proceeding
was
brought
against
him
in
1953
and
he
was
again
ordered
deported
and
it
was
ordered
--
the
order
of
deportation
was
upheld
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
it
was
then
that
he
brought
the
present
declaratory
judgment
action,
to
have
himself
declared
an
american
citizen
and
of
course,
if
he
prevails
in
that
--
in
this
suit,
the
deportation
order
will
necessarily
be
invalidated
because
he
will
not
be
an
alien
and
therefore
not
subject
to
deportation.
two
terms
ago,
the
court
handed
down
two
decisions
in
the
perez
and
trop
cases.
before
i
begin
to
discuss
section
401
(j),
i'd
like,
if
i
may,
to
give
a
summary
of
what
in
our
view
those
two
cases
decided
and
what
is
the
present
background
of
the
--
of
existing
law
and
expatriation
as
i
stand
here
to
argue
this
case.
the
perez
case
as
the
court
remembers
involves
section
401
(e)
of
the
1940
nationality
act,
the
foreign
voting
provision
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
was
very
majority
of
the
court,
we
think
decided
the
following
propositions.
we
think,
the
court,
the
majority
of
the
court
decided,
that
congress
did
have
the
power
to
denationalize
american
citizens
in
appropriate
cases.
and
it
rejected
the
notion
that
such
denationalization
can
only
follow
upon
a
voluntary
renunciation
by
the
citizen
himself.
second,
we
think
the
court
decided,
in
our
view
and
in
the
court's
view
affirming
or
conforming
what
had
previously
been
decided
in
mackenzie
against
hare
and
in
the
savorgnan
case
decided
that
in
a
subjective
intent
to
give
up
ones
nationality
was
not
a
prerequisite
and
therefore,
was
not
required
to
validate
denationalization.
and
third,
we
think
the
court
decided
that
the
general
standard
for
determining
the
validity
of
an
expatriation
statute
of
congress
was
the
rational
connection
of
the
denationalization
with
a
granted
power
of
congress
and
that
case,
as
decided
by
the
court,
it
was
the
foreign
affairs
power
and
we
think
the
court
recognized
that
due
deference
has
to
be
given
to
the
judgment
of
congress
at
the
same
time
that
due
deference
is
paid
to
the
cherished
status
of
american
citizenship.
now,
the
court
also
had
before
it,
the
second
case,
the
trop
case
as
to
which
there
was
no
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
court.
as
we
read
it,
the
section
401
(g)
was
invalidated
by
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
court
as
improper
punishment.
the
four
justices
who
joined
in
the
chief
justice's
opinion,
we
think
held
that
in
the
circumstances
there
where
trop,
the
petitioner
in
that
case
did
not
have
a
second
citizenship,
he
was
not
a
dual
national
that
the
consequence
of
statelessness
which
would
be
vested
upon
him
by
the
denationalization
provision
of
congress
constituted
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
as
we
read
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
substance,
he
--
he
was
of
the
view
that
the
punishment
of
denationalization
was
too
drastic
a
penalty
for
the
objectives
to
be
gained,
sought
to
be
gained
by
congress.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
don't
read
it
that
way,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
will
--
i
will
explain
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
as
we
--
we
read
--
as
we
see
the
situation,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
this.
mr.
justice
whittaker
who
did
not
join
in
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
perez
case,
the
voting
case,
in
his
memorandum
there,
said
that
he
did
agree
with
the
general
principle
that
was
adopted
in
the
perez
case
than
in
appropriate
cases,
congress
did
have
the
power
to
denationalize
citizen
--
citizens,
regardless
of
his
voluntary
desire
to
be
denationalized.
as
i
read
the
section
of
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
the
trop
case,
he
is
speaking
for
himself
and
the
two
colleagues
who
joined
him
in
dissent
and
in
perez
but
not
mr.
justice
whittaker
who
had
made
his
views
on
the
general
subject
of
plans.
so
that
i
think
that
the
law
as
i
stand
here
today
is
the
--
the
perez
case,
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
perez
case
and
i
think
the
chief
justice
if
i
may
say
so
recognized
in
his
opinion
in
the
trop
case
that
that
was
so
because
he
says
the
majority
of
the
court
has
taken
another
view
and
i
will
attempt
to
get
--
i
will
give
the
reasons
why
in
our
view
that
section,
section
401
(g),
the
desertion
section
was
invalid
even
under
the
view
of
the
majority
in
--
in
the
perez.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
i
think
that
i
may
fairly
be
said
is
the
one
in
which
justice
whittaker
joined
with
the
other
three
justices
and
justice
brennan
had
of
course
his
own
opinion.
the
burden
of
my
argument
of
course
will
be
to
try
to
show
the
court
that
there
are
differences
between
401
(g),
the
desertion
section
which
was
involved
in
the
trop
case
and
401
(j)
the
draft
evasion
section
which
i
haven't
in
the
case
which
is
before
your
honors
now.
they
both
have
a
common
source.
it
is
true
that
both
of
these
provisions
find
their
common
progenitor
in
the
1865
statute
of
the
civil
war
congress
which
provided
for
loss
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
by
deserters
and
those
who
went
beyond
the
district
having
enrolled
in
the
draft.
we
have
always
maintained
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
the
court
who
were
not,
mr.
justice
stewart,
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
perez
case,
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
the
parts
of
our
briefs
in
the
perez
and
trop
cases
in
which
we
tried
to
show
that
the
1865
statute
was
a
true
loss
of
nationality
statute
and
not
merely
a
forfeiture
of
franchise
right.
i
don't
know
if
that's
too
decisive,
but
i
thought
that
--
we
have
maintained
that
we
think
that
this
is
supported
by
the
congressional
treatment
of
the
statute
by
the
administrative
treatment
and
by
certain
court
decisions.
but
the
--
the
factors
in
which
the
1865
statute
is
different
from
the
later
statute,
both
the
desertion
statute
which
is
before
the
court
in
trop
and
the
draft
evasion
statute
which
is
before
the
court
in
the
present
time
are
these.
under
the
1865
statute,
a
court-martial
conviction
was
required,
that
is
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
court
required
a
court-martial
conviction.
and
second,
it
was
not
necessary
to
leave
the
country
in
order
to
have
invoked
the
provisions
of
the
1865
statute
either
as
to
desertion
or
as
to
draft
evasion.
the
provision
that's
draft
evasion
in
the
1865
statute
merely
provided
for
loss
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
if
you
left
the
district
where
you
were
enrolled,
not
if
you
left
the
country.
and,
i
shall
try
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
our
view,
the
leaving
of
the
country
is
a
very
decisive
factor
and
a
very
different
factor
from
what
was
the
congress
had
in
the
earlier
statute.
well,
this
1865
statute
continues
in
effect,
in
1912
it
was
modified
to
apply
--
to
apply
--
only
to
peace
time
desertion.
of
course
since
there
was
no
draft
after
the
civil
war.
there
was
no
effectiveness
of
the
draft
evasion
provision
until
world
war
ii
and
it
was
considered
to
be
in
effect
in
world
war
ii.
it
was
repealed
in
1940
when
congress
passed
the
general
nationality
act
and
recodified
the
whole
matter.
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
there
is
no
reference
anywhere
to
why
it
was
repealed.
i
think
the
true
answer
probably
is
that
the
draft
evasion
at
that
--
when
the
cabinet
committee
and
the
congressional
committees
were
considering
the
problem
of
loss
of
nationality
for
the
new
code,
there
was
no
draft
act
in
effect.
it
only
went
in
to
effect
in
october
1940
and
so,
they
didn't
think
it
necessary
to
continue
the
draft
evasion
part
of
the
earlier
statute.
they
did
continue
the
desertion
provision
in
section
401
(g)
which
is
here
in
trop.
but
congress
did
come
along
as
the
court
remembers
very
quickly
in
the
spring
--
in
the
fall
of
1940
and
passed
a
new
selective
service
act.
and
i
think
though
that
act
was
in
a
sense
going
through
congress
simultaneously,
it
was
too
new
and
too
quick
a
change
to
make
anybody
think
of
making
a
change
in
the
draft
evasion
provisions.
well,
at
any
rate
they
didn't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
were
before
different
committees
actually
and
so
it
was
not
until
1944,
that
suggestion
was
made
that
a
provision
providing
for
expatriation
for
denationalization
for
going
beyond
the
country
to
evade
the
draft
was
suggested
to
congress
and
enacted.
the
attorney
general
made
the
suggestion
in
1944
and
it
was
unanimously
recommended
by
the
appropriate
committees
of
both
houses
and
passed
by
both
houses
with
very
short
debate.
it
was
made
very
clear
in
the
legislative
history
at
that
time
that
they
were
to
be
in
a
sense
these
two
differences
from
the
earlier
civil
war
statute
that
is
no
criminal
or
court
martial
conviction
was
to
be
required
for
draft
evasion.
congress
thought
that
there
would
be
many
people
who
would
never
return
to
the
country
and
therefore
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
having
a
criminal
conviction.
it
was
made
quite
clear
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
at
least
that
they
didn't
want
these
people
whom
they
felt
had
lost
the
right
to
be
american
citizens
to
come
back
to
the
country.
but
they
did
want
them
to
have
the
right
of
court
review
and
so
they
provided
for
a
court
review
under
section
503
of
the
nationality
act
which
is
the
general
provision
of
that
statute
providing
for
a
court
review
of
a
claim
of
american
citizenship
in
which
there
is
de
novo
determination
of
the
facts
by
the
district
courts.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
right
to
a
jury
trial,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
an
equity
proceeding,
preparatory
judgment.
we
think
that
there
are
three
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
denatural
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
it
has
been
traditionally
true
of
denaturalization
proceedings
and
also
of
--
of
all
types
of
proceedings
involving
issues
as
to
nationality
even
those
prior
to
the
1940
statute
were
under
the
decision
of
the
court
in
yun
fang
ho,
it
was
said
that
there
could
be
a
right
to
de
novo
review.
there
has
never
been
a
jury
trial
in
any
of
those.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
sir.
he
was
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
may
be
significant
on
some
alternative
arguments.
it
is
not
significant
--
it
is
not
basically
significant
to
my
--
my
primary
arguments.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
think
that
there
are
three
heads
of
jurisdiction
that
congress
had
in
order
to
pass
this
particular
provision
of
the
1940
statute.
i'll
state
if
i
may
in
summary
form
first.
the
relationship
to
foreign
affairs
second
the
inherent
right
of
a
nation
to
declare
to
denationalize
a
citizen
who
puts
himself
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
the
authority
of
the
country
as
this
man
did
by
going
to
beyond
the
country
where
our
processes
could
not
reach
him,
even
extradition
as
i
point
out
could
not
reach
him.
he
in
a
sense
deprived
not
only
the
particular
draft
law
that
he
was
accused
of
and
later
convicted
of
--
of
disobeying
but
he
defied
all
power
of
the
authority
--
of
the
country
to
be
able
to
reach
him,
to
compel
him
to
perform
his
duty.
and
the
third
head
of
jurisdiction
are
the
war
powers
which
we
think
also
authorized
congress
to
pass
this
particular
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
my
view
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
that
is,
if
not
if
he
fled
the
country
to
a
place
from
which
he
could
be
extradited.
the
theory
which
in
it
is
--
i'll
try
to
develop
a
little
later,
the
theory
is,
that
if
you
put
yourself
wholly
beyond
the
reach
of
the
united
states
in
a
sense
that
if
you
don't
say
as
some
people
have
said,
i
won't
do
what
you
want
me
to
do
i'll
disobey
your
laws,
but
then
you
can
do
with
me
what
you
will
that
is
you
can
impose
punishment
on
me
i
will
fight
it
but
at
least
i
will
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
to
the
judicial
authority,
that's
one
thing.
but,
if
a
man
goes
wholly
beyond
the
united
states
to
a
place
where
he
can't
be
reached
even
by
extradition,
then,
we
think
it's
a
wholly
different
thing
because
then
we
think
the
individual
has
in
a
sense
if
i
may
say
so,
broken
the
ultimate
compact
between
the
citizen
and
the
country
which
is
that
the
citizen
will
at
least
agree
to
submit
himself
to
the
ultimate
authority
of
the
country.
he
may
not
agree
to
obey
its
laws
and
he
may
not
agree
to
do
anything,
but
he
will
at
least
agree
that
he
is
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
and
authority.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
say
that
--
i
don't
have
to
go
as
further
in
my
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
have
to
go
any
further
in
my
argument
than
to
say
that
the
man
flees
to
a
county
from
which
he
cannot
be
reached
either
by
a
form
of
extradition
treaty
or
by
the
handing
over
of
the
state.
the
reason
i
made
that
qualification
is
i
thought
you
said
there
were
some
countries
that
didn't
have
an
extradition
treaty
but
might
hand
them
over
anyway.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
they
can't
deprive
him
for
the
purpose
of
evading
taxes
unless
he
goes
to
a
place
where
he
cannot
be
reached,
where
he
defies
the
authority
of
the
country
and
i
gather
support
for
that
mr.
chief
justice
not
only
from
the
what
might
be
called
the
ultimate
relationship
of
the
citizens
of
the
country
that
the
citizen
has
some
ultimate
obligation.
the
ultimate
obligation
is
to
submit
to
the
authority
of
the
country.
but
i
--
i
derive
some
support
from
that
--
even
from
the
wording
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
says
that
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
are
citizens
thereof
and
it
says
born
or
naturalized
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
i
think
implicit
in
that
notion
is
the
fact
that
the
american
citizen
does
not
put
himself
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
so
that
we
can't
reach
him
in
any
way.
i
don't
mean
just
by
going
abroad
but
we
can't
reach
him
even
through
our
international
treaties
or
through
diplomatic
negotiations.
that
we
can't
reach
him
really
short
of
going
to
war
with
the
place
to
which
he
has
gone.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
--
that
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
people
lose
their
american
citizenship.
i'm
saying
that
implicit
in
it
is
the
possibility
that
congress
can
take
the
position
that
if
a
man
puts
himself
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
then
he
shall
and
the
united
states
wants
him.
of
course
if
the
united
states
doesn't
want
him,
and
they
say
it's
perfectly
all
right
to
go
to
--
to
grass
stock
or
lichtenstein
or
wherever
you
wish
then
--
and
you
may
stay
there
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
the
united
states
wants
him
and
says
we
want
you
to
come
back
to
perform
a
certain
duty
and
he
says,
“no,
i
will
not
and
i'm
putting
myself
in
a
place
where
you
cannot
reach
me”
then
we
think
that
that
is
permissible
both
under
the
principles
of
the
perez
case
and
in
the
implicit
assumptions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
he
can
be,
that
congress
can
provide
for
denationalization
of
such
a
person.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
--
if
congress
wanted
him
back
for
some
purpose.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
if
they
said,
we
want
all
citizens
to
come
back
for
military
training,
yes.
i
would
also
say,
i
would
take
that
position
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
would
also
say,
that
i'm
not
required
to
take
that
position
in
this
case
where
the
obligation
which
he
refused
to
fulfill
has
been
termed
--
called
by
this
court
the
supreme,
the
ultimate
obligation
of
a
citizen
that
is
of
military
service
in
many
cases.
and
so,
all
i'm
required
to
take
for
this
case
is
the
position
that
if
a
citizen
goes
abroad
to
evade
that
ultimate
obligation,
to
a
place
where
he
cannot
be
reached
then
congress
can
constitutionally
provide
for
his
loss
of
nationality.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
think
congress
can
constitutionally
provide
that
american
citizens
who
remain
abroad
for
a
prolonged
period
of
time.
this
is
a
provision
of
the
statute
with
relation
of
naturalized
citizens
today
and
many
other
countries
have
of
similar
provision
with
relation
to
both
native
born
and
naturalized
citizens
if
they
live
abroad
for
a
prolonged
period
of
time
without
returning
to
the
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
know
of
none
and
i've
seen
no
reference
to
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
of
any,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
haven't
made
a
search.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i've
not
seen
any
references.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
right
to
vote.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
and
other
--
other
rights
--
a
labeled
rights
to
the
citizenship,
yes.
there
are
many
such
and
of
course
the
federal
criminal
code
has
similar
provisions
for
people
convicted
of
federal
criminal
crime
--
federal
crimes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
loss
of
right
to
hold
public
office
for
instance.
that's
a
--
a
--
provision
which
appears
several
times
in
the
18
united
states
code.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
with
relations
to
specific
crimes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
in
addition
to
the
--
to
the
general
proposition
which
i
--
i've
just
been
discussing
it
in
colloquy
with
the
chief
justice,
we
think
that
the
foreign
affairs
power
does
give
sanction
to
this
statute
which
congress
enacted
in
1940
and
it's
clear
that
foreign
affairs
can
be
involved
because
the
citizen,
the
statute
doesn't
come
into
effect
unless
the
citizen
goes
abroad.
when
he
goes
abroad
to
another
country,
to
mexico
as
in
this
case,
there
is
involved
another
country.
the
united
states
which
is
the
country
of
his
nationality
has
double
interest.
it
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
he
returns
if
possible
to
serve
his
--
his
country
in
the
armed
forces
as
is
required
to
do
and
it
also
has
another
we
think
interest
that
is
it
has
an
interest
in
saying
that
a
particular
country
nearby
whether
it
will
be
mexico
or
some
other
country
does
not
become
a
center
of
refuge
or
disaffection
for
a
large
number
of
draft
evaders
that
we
think
is
a
--
a
responsible
interest
which
the
united
states
can
have.
now,
since
the
draft
evader
is
in
another
country,
the
united
states
can
call
upon
the
other
country
to
deliver
him
up
and
say,
we
want
you
mexico
or
what
other
country
to
send
mr.
mendoza-martinez
back
to
this
country.
and
that
is
a
possibility
of
embroilment
there
or
the
united
states
can
get
in
touch
with
the
draft
evader
individually,
questionably
and
say
we
want
you
to
return
back.
now,
he
may
then
turn
to
the
country
where
he
is
because
the
country
where
he
is
a
country
of
his
present
residence
and
he
can
call
upon
them
at
least
for
a
certain
measure
of
protection
and
he
can
turn
to
mexico
and
say,
i
don't
want
to
go
back
to
the
united
states,
you
help
me
to
stay
here
i
don't
want
to
go
back
and
serve
in
the
army.
i
shall
try
to
point
out
later
that
of
course
all
these
possibilities
are
heightened
when
he
is
a
national
of
the
country
of
–
of
play
as
he
was
in
this
case,
but
i'm
speaking
now
of
a
situation
where
he
is
not
a
national
of
the
country
at
play.
he
is
just
an
alien
resident
in
mexico
and
i'm
trying
to
point
out
the
possibilities
of
international
embroilment
which
can
occur
just
from
this
situation.
now,
this
is
not
a
passable
possibility
we
think.
the
19th
century
history
of
the
relationship
of
the
united
states
with
great
britain
and
france
and
germany
and
austria
does
show
the
difficulties
that
can
arise
when
a
country
which
has
conscription
as
great
britain,
france,
austria
and
germany
did
in
the
19th
century
and
wants
to
enforce
conscription,
the
difficulties
that
can
arise
when
that
country
reaches
over
to
another
country
and
says,
“you
have
a
national
of
our
country
living
in
your
territory,
we
want
him
back.”
the
pages
of
morris
digest
of
--
in
national
law
and
other
books
are
filled
with
--
with
diplomatic
negotiations
between
this
country
and
other
countries
with
respect
to
claim
of
the
foreign
countries
to
have
their
citizens
or
people
they
regarded
as
their
citizens,
return
to
that
country
for
the
purpose
of
observing
in
the
armies.
now,
this
possibility
can
arise
in
the
future.
it
is
certainly
not
beyond
possibility
that
certain
countries
here
and
near
this
united
states
or
faraway
could
become
centers
of
draft
evasion
or
disaffection
and
it
--
in
a
situation
it
might
become
very
important
for
the
united
states
to
be
able
to
secure
as
large
an
amount
of
manpower
as
possible
for
the
army
and
it
would
in
a
situation
like
that
make
a
request
to
these
countries
saying,
don't
--
don't
accept
americans
who
come
to
your
country
for
this
purpose.
send
them
back
or
refuse
them
at
the
borders.
our
opponents
say,
well,
the
united
states
of
course
isn't
required
to
make
a
request
to
the
other
country,
it
isn't
required
to
create
an
international
embroilment
but
of
course
you
don't
judge
these
issues
and
you
don't
test
them
by
whether
it's
the
other
country
which
first
raises
the
issue
or
whether
it
is
we
who
raised
the
issue.
extradition
matters
are
matters
of
foreign
affairs,
but
we
are
always
the
one
who
is
asking
the
other
country
to
send
back,
when
we're
asking
to
extradite
somebody,
send
back
the
alleged
criminal
from
the
other
country
or
when
an
american
is
mistreated
abroad,
it's
this
country
which
raises
with
the
other
country
the
issue
of
the
american
being
mistreated
abroad.
so,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
substance
in
the
argument
that
the
united
states,
even
though
its
thought
that
another
country
was
becoming
too
large
a
center
of
--
too
large
a
refuge
or
sanctuary
for
draft
evaders
should,
shall
we
say
forestall
any
international
complications
by
refusing
to
--
to
draw
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
other
country.
it
is
in
the
realm
of
foreign
of
affairs
and
it's
a
matter
which
the
united
states
can
appropriately
take
up
with
the
other
country
as
the
whole
history
of
the
19th
century
indicates.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice
harlan,
at
page
31
of
our
brief
is
a
footnote
which
summarizes
a
table
which
was
appended
to
the
government's
brief
in
the
perez
case
and
it
gives
the
total.
the
total
is
about
1000
full
of
period
from
1948
to
1959.
now,
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
this
is
only
an
administrative
determination
that
is
the
commission
of
immigration
and
the
state
department,
the
matter
comes
to
their
attention
makes
a
determination
which
is
not
of
course
binding
on
the
individual
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
been
expatriated.
many
of
these
have
not
sought
to
bring
court
actions,
but
many
of
them
had
and
these
figures
here
relate
only
to
the
administrative
figure
so
you
can't
definitively
say
that
that
number
of
people
have
been
expatriated
though
i
suppose
many
of
them
has
accepted
the
administrative
determination
of
it
in
that
sort
of
court
action.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
--
what
i'm
--
yes
i
think
that
as
soon
as
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
what
--
what
i
was
trying
to
argue
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
did
not
make
it
clear
enough
was
that
there
is
this
possibility
of
foreign
affairs
involvement
here
as
there
was
with
relation
to
voting
in
the
perez
case
and
that
congress
could
decide
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
suppose
congress
did
not
pass
the
statute,
suppose
congress
did
what
the
opponents
say
they
should
have
done
and
that
is
increased
criminal
penalties
on
people
who
went
abroad
then
you
would
have
pressure
on
the
united
states
to
go
and
get
these
people.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
congress
chose
to
root
here
which
it
chose
in
the
perez
case
to
say,
we
cut
them
loose.
we
will
no
longer
be
interested
in
that,
and
that
will
minimize
the
possibilities
of
foreign
embroilment
and
then
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
other
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
nation
always
has
the
power
to
exclude
them
from
its
borders.
it
has
that
power
as
a
sovereign
nation.
and
--
and
i
think
you're
right,
i
didn't
make
it
clear
and
i
--
i
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
make
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
minimize
and
--
and
limit
the
possibilities
of
foreign
embroilment
which
could
occur
if
the
other
methods
of
handling
the
problem
of
draft
evasion
by
flight
were
adapted
which
had
been
suggested
by
our
opponents
and
by
others.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
it
isn't
an
efficient
way
to
raise
an
army
but
the
--
debates
make
it
clear
that
congress
thought
that
there's
nothing
like
--
that
--
that
these
people
were
gone
and
you
might
as
well
cut
them
loose.
they
said
that
they
weren't
worthy
of
being
american
citizens,
we
didn't
want
them
back.
and
though
i
will
make
the
argument
later
that
--
that
the
one
support
for
this
statute
is
in
war
powers
of
congress
that
is
it
does
have
certain
inducing
effects
on
--
deterring
effects
on
an
individual.
i
think
that
the
--
the
major
purpose
as
revealed
by
the
debates
was
not
so
much
that
as
the
--
the
cutting
off
of
these
individuals
who
had
in
either
congress
refuse
to
comply
with
the
highest
obligation
of
the
citizen.
before
the
recess,
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
--the
emphasis
which
all
these
problems
that
i've
been
talking
about
bear
when
the
evaders
is
a
dual
national
as
he
is
in
this
case
because
of
course
then
he
can
call
upon
the
country
where
he
is
residing
not
only
as
a
resident
but
as
a
citizen
and
--
and
say,
“i'm
a
mexican,
i
don't
want
to
go
and
fight
for
the
united
states.”
and
of
course
that
country,
the
country
of
the
evasion,
has
an
interest
in
protecting
its
citizens
which
is
somewhat
greater
than
in
protecting
its
resident.
now,
these
two
isn't
fanciful
because
in
the
first
of
these
cases
in
this
court
the
gonzales
case
about
three
terms
ago,
which
went
off
on
the
ground
of
burden
of
proof,
gonzales
did
make
the
argument
at
an
executive
agreement
between
mexico
and
the
unites
states
freed
him
from
all
service
in
the
united
states.
and
so,
it
isn't
fanciful
to
say
that
a
dual
national
who
is
in
another
country
will
argue
that
he
--
that
he
isn't
required
to
come
to
this
country
to
perform
a
service.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
but
i
think
it
has
a
--
a
bearing
in
two
respect.
one
is
that
the
history
is
very
clear
and
the
actual
history
under
the
statute
is
clear
that
it
has
--
it's
had
its
major
impact
on
dual
nationals.
every
case
that
we
have
found
where
anyone
has
been
expatriated
appears
to
have
been
a
dual
national
probably
of
mexico
and
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
was
second
argument,
mr.
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
justice
frankfurter
that
it
was
an
inducing
cause.
this
becomes
clear
from
the
--
from
the
letters
which
the
attorney
general
sent
to
the
senate
committees
as
well
as
from
the
debates
that
there
--
it
was
clear
that
they
were
talking
mostly
about
people
who
went
to
mexico
and
there
was
a
specific
reference
to
the
fact
that
these
--
these
were
mexican
nationals
too.
so,
i
rest
on
both
grounds,
mr.
justice.
if
necessary,
i
would
also
rest
of
course
on
a
ground
of
separability
that
the
case
before
the
court
involves
a
dual
national
and
that
separability
clause
of
the
1940
act
would
separate
out
any
other
non-valid
application
of
the
statute.
we
think
also
that
--
that
--
on
--
on
this
matter
of
flight
abroad
that
it
does,
particularly
where
the
individual
is
a
dual
national,
it
does
show
in
--
in
reference
to
what
the
court
said
in
the
perez
case
about
a
choice
of
allegiance.
that
it
does
show
a
choice
on
the
part
of
this
man
for
the
protection
of
mexico,
his
other
nationality
rather
than
the
responsibilities
of
--
or
the
obligations
of
his
american
citizenship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
those
who
seek
to
invalidate
this
statute
section
401
(j)
characterize
it
as
punishment
and
of
course,
they
rest
upon
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
trop
case
in
which
that
statute
the
desertion
section
was
characterized
as
punishment
and
held
to
be
invalid.
we
think
that
this
is
different
at
least
as
presently
applied
to
this
particular
individual
in
various
respects.
first,
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
for
the
four
justices
in
trop
rested
we
think
primarily
on
the
fact
as
i
mentioned
before
that
the
result
of
expatriation
or
denationalization
in
that
sense
would
be
statelessness
and
the
discussion
is
in
terms
of
statelessness.
that
of
course
would
not
be
the
result
here
because
this
particular
appellee
is
a
national
of
mexico
and
would
remain
a
national
of
mexico
and
as
i
indicated
before
lunch
that
that
is
not
a
freak
situation.
that
appears
to
be,
i
can't
speak
statistically
because
we
don't
know,
it
appears
to
be
the
majority
situation
or
at
least
a
very
substantial
situation
with
respect
to
all
the
cases
which
have
come
up
or
most
of
the
cases
which
have
come
up
both
judicially
and
administratively
under
section
401
(j).
and
as
i
also
mentioned
in
answer
to
a
query
from
justice
frankfurter
immediately
before
the
recess,
if
necessary,
we
would
of
course
say
that
the
statute
can
be
separably
--
separately
upheld
as
to
dual
nationals.
we
don't
of
course
concede
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
to
people
who
are
not
dual
nationals,
but
we
do
have
that
extra
argument
as
to
a
person
like
this
appellee
who
is
a
dual
national
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
apparently,
a
large
percentage
of
people
affected
by
this
statute
fall
in
to
the
same
category
of
dual
nationals.
then,
secondly,
with
reference
to
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
trop
case,
we
think
that
there
are
these
distinctions.
there's
the
foreign
affairs
matter
which
of
course
was
not
present
in
the
--
in
the
trop
case
because
desertion
could
occur
in
this
country
and
expatriation
could
occur
right
in
this
country
as
was
pointed
out.
there
is
not
of
course
also
the
factor
of
the
total
repudiation
of
all
authority
of
this
country
by
going
to
someplace
where
the
hand
of
the
country
would
not
reach
him.
there
is
--
of
course
also
not
the
fact
of
dual
nationality
which
i
just
mentioned,
but
in
addition
to
those
factors,
there
are
three
other
factors
that
i
think
i
should
mention.
one
is,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
pointed
in
your
opinion
in
the
trop
case
that
desertion
need
not
always
be
serious.
that
there
might
be
desertions
from
army
training
camps
in
this
country
and
you
pointed
out
various
situations
in
which
desertion
would
not
be
serious.
i
think
the
same
cannot
be
said
here.
i
think
that
fleeing
the
country
to
evade
the
draft
is
always
serious
or
remaining
abroad
to
evade
the
draft
is
always
a
serious
offense
against
--
against
the
country.
a
second
differentiating
factor
is
that
in
the
trop
case,
as
the
court
will
recall
there
was
the
power
of
restoration
which
was
in
the
hands
of
the
military
that
is
the
military
could
restore
citizenship
so
to
speak
by
reenlisting
or
re-inducting
the
man
and
some
of
the
justices
indicated
a
disagreement
with
that
power
in
the
hands
of
the
military.
that
of
course
does
not
exist
here.
there
is
no
such
power
in
the
hands
of
the
military.
and
the
third
other
differentiating
factor
in
addition
to
the
general
ones
of
foreign
affairs
which
i've
mentioned
is
that
in
the
trop
case,
the
denationalization
follow
from
an
--
a
criminal
conviction
and
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
and
perhaps
some
of
the
other
justices
pointed
out
that
the
--
whatever
deterrent
effect
might
happen,
the
expatriation
would
have
would
be
minimal
compared
to
the
criminal
conviction.
well
here,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
criminal
conviction.
in
fact,
the
--
the
debates
reveal
and
in
most
cases,
congress
thought
the
people
would
never
return
to
the
country
and
therefore
would
never
be
able
to
be
a
proceeded
against
criminally.
they
did
indicate
that
if
they
did
return,
there
was
to
be
this
additional
conditional
qualification
of
denationalization.
but
i
--
making
a
more
broader
argument
than
just
the
differences
between
this
case
and
the
trop
case,
i
want
to
go
back
if
i
may
to
--
to
present
the
argument
that
this
statute,
in
its
inception
in
1944
and
its
place
in
the
1940
act
was
not
a
penal
statute
at
all
in
--
in
major
essence
and
in
major
incidence.
the
court
--
i
won't
recall
for
the
court
the
legislative
history,
the
1940
act
because
it
was
quite
thoroughly
canvassed
in
the
--
in
the
opinions
in
the
earlier
cases,
but
the
cabinet
committee
did
say
that
none
of
the
grounds
of
denationalization
which
were
presented
in
that
act
were
punitive
in
purpose.
now,
you
come
to
1944
when
this
particular
section
was
added
to
the
--
to
the
portion
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940
which
dealt
with
loss
of
nationality
to
that
very
portion
of
the
nationality
act
which
the
cabinet
committee
had
said,
did
not
impose
any
punitive
sanctions.
i
think
perhaps
the
most
important
thing
which
i
could
say
is
that
congress
of
course
had
the
1865
civil
war
statute.
it
deliberate
before
it,
it
deliberately
made
a
change.
it
did
not
require
any
criminal
conviction.
it
knew
that
the
1865
statute
has
been
interpreted
as
a
penal
statute
as
a
punitive
statute.
it
made
a
change
from
that
statute.
it
did
not
require
any
--
any
criminal
conviction
at
all
and
i
think
the
reason
was
as
i've
already
indicated
that
they
expected
that
lots
of
these
people
would
not
come
back
to
the
country.
now,
my
--
the
opponents
will
undoubtedly
point
out
that
in
the
debates,
there
was
certain
language
in
which
the
word
penalty
or
punishment
was
used
and
of
course,
that
was
true,
but
i
would
like
to
go
through
the
debates
and
the
history
to
show
--
to
put
these
statements
in
context.
if
you
will
look
at
the
reports
of
the
committees,
you
will
not
find
any
reference
to
punishment
or
penalty.
you
will
find
a
letter
from
the
attorney
general,
francis
biddle
at
that
time,
suggesting
this
provision
and
talking
in
terms
of
these
people
not
being
worthy
of
citizenship
in
terms
of
a
qualification
or
a
condition
rather
than
a
punishment
to
be
imposed
upon
certain
actions.
then,
and
i
did
not
find
in
reading
the
--
the
reports
of
the
committees
any
reference
to
punishment
or
penalty
at
all.
then,
we
come
to
the
house
debates
and
this
bill
was
first
passed
in
the
house.
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
house
debates
would
also
not
reveal
any
real
reference
to
penalties
or
punishments.
the
major
concern
of
the
house
was
in
saying
that
these
people
were
not
worthy
of
american
citizenship.
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
return
to
this
country
after
they
had
failed
to
fulfill
their
duties.
there
was
a
reference
by
congressman
dickstein
that
he
considered
these
people
to
be
traitors,
but
i
think
that
was
a
general
colloquial
reference
rather
than
a
designation
of
this
as
a
crime
or
punishment.
now,
you
--
i
think
the
real
main
burden
of
the
--
of
the
history
in
the
house
was
in
terms
of
qualification,
in
terms
rather
not
of
punishment,
but
of
qualifications
for
citizenship.
then
you
come
to
the
senate
and
it
was
a
very
short
debate
in
the
senate
and
senator
russell
did
use
the
term
punishment.
these
people
are
worthy
of
punishment
or
a
penalty,
he
did.
i
--
i
would
stress
the
fact
that
this
was
a
bill
which
was
unanimously
reported
and
unanimously
accepted
and
then
on
the
basis
of
a
very
short
debate
in
--
in
the
senate
in
which
the
one
person
who
spoke,
though
he
was
a
chairman
of
the
committee,
he
was,
a
colloquial
usage
of
the
term
punishment
or
penalty
should
not
be
used
to
invalidate
a
statute
of
congress.
that
when
you
seek
to
invalidate
a
statute
of
congress
on
the
ground
of
unconstitutionality
of
its
invalidly
imposing
punishment,
i
think
you
have
to
have
something
more
than
some
words
spoken
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
obviously
unprepared
and
extemporaneously
in
which
a
word
was
used
which
in
other
context
might
invalidate
the
statute,
that
is
if
it
were
truly
punishable.
i
have
already
--
i
don't
want
conceive
that
if
it
were
punishment
it
would
be
invalid
because
my
alternative
argument
of
course
would
be,
that
even
if
it
were
punishment,
the
consequence
which
arose
in
the
trop
case
of
statelessness
would
not
occur
here
and
therefore
you
would
not
have
the
holding
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
that
you
had
in
that
case,
but
that's
my
--
i
might
call
secondary
argument.
the
broader
argument
i
would
make
is
that
the
statute
does
not
impose
punishment
at
all
and
therefore
is
not
to
be
governed
by
the
provisions
of
the
eighth
amendment
or
the
other
criminal
provisions
of
the
constitution.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
couldn't
make
the
argument.
i
could
make
part
of
the
argument
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
could
make
the
argument
that
he
would
not
be
stateless
which
was
i
think
that
the
most
important
factor
in
the
decision
of
the
four
members
of
the
court
who
joined
in
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
trop
because
even
thought
he
lost
his
american
nationality,
he
would
still
be
a
mexican
citizen.
and
i
could
make
that
argument.
i
could
not
make
the
argument
of
his
ability
to
call
upon
the
state
of
his
own
nationality
for
protection.
but
there
would
be
an
argument,
not
as
strong
but
i
think
that
would
exist
and
could
exist
in
the
situation
whereby
mexico,
if
it
were
in
difficulties
with
the
united
states
could
say
to
cuba,
we
don't
want
you
to
send
mendoza
back
to
the
united
states;
he
is
our
national,
he's
a
mexican
and
we
want
you
to
keep
him
there
in
cuba
we
don't
want
him
to
go
back
to
the
united
states
to
fight
in
this
war
which
we
don't
agree
with.
so
that
the
fact
that
he
is
a
dual
national
and
has
another
country's
--
another
country
has
an
interest
in
him
and
protects
him
is
always
a
factor
regardless
of
where
he
goes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
all
i've
read
is
the
government's
brief
in
the
memorandum
in
the
trial
court
and
they
did
raise
the
issue
of
dual
nationality.
that
was
most
clear.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
did
said
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
they
did
not
say
--
say
it
in
the
sense
and
i
do
not
think
we
could
say
it
in
the
sense
in
which
the
dissenters
in
the
perez
case
were
talking
about
it.
i
do
think
that
we
can't
say
and
we
do
say
that
it
is
an
indication
of
a
kind
of
choice,
not
that
he
voluntarily
renounced
american
citizenship
because
i
don't
think
he
had
that
in
mind,
but
that
he
knew
he
was
a
mexican
national
and
he
chose
the
protection
of
mexico
as
against
his
obligations
to
the
united
states
and
in
that
sense,
i
can't
definitively
say
that
we
made
that
argument
because
i
don't
recall
but
--
but
it's
an
argument
of
law
anyway
and
i
make
it
here
now.
on
the
issue
of
due
process,
i
think
counsel
was
in
error
in
talking
about
the
burden
of
proof
under
section
503
of
the
nationality
act
--
under
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
as
i
well
know
from
a
case
that
i
had
argued
previously
in
this
court,
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff,
the
mendoza
in
this
case
to
show
that
he
was
born
in
america
which
he
does
by
showing
his
proof,
i
mean,
showing
his
birth
in
the
united
states.
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
united
states
to
prove
that
he
was
expatriated
so
he
does
not
bear
the
burden
of
proving,
under
this
court's
decision,
that
he
is
not
expatriated.
he
bears
the
very
simple
burden
of
showing
that
he
was
born
i
believe
in
california
in
1922.
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
united
states
to
show
that
he
went
to
mexico
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft
or
remain
there.
of
course
those
issues
are
not
involved
in
this
case
in
view
of
the
undisputed
stipulated
facts,
but
the
--
the
general
counsel
i
think
misapprehends
the
request
of
the
proceedings
under
the
statute.
counsel
said
to
the
court
that
congress
could
not
have
been
interested
in
foreign
affairs
problems
because
of
the
wording
that
it
shows
for
the
statute.
he
thought
that
congress
should
have
said,
departing
from
or
remaining
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
in
time
of
war
or
during
a
period
declared
by
the
presidency
to
be
national
emergency.
instead
of
saying
that,
they
should
have
said,
departing
from
or
outside
the
united
states
to
enter
a
foreign
country,
i
suggest
that
if
that
language
had
been
used
and
a
man
had
gone
on
a
ship
of
a
foreign
nationality,
the
government
would
have
a
much
harder
job
than
we
have
here
today,
but
the
general
language
departing
from
a
remaining
outside
the
jurisdiction
covers
practically
every
though
of
it
because
it
covers
anybody
who
goes
to
the
land
territory
of
the
foreign
country
and
it
covers
people
who
go
on
ships
or
airplanes
of
foreign
countries.
the
only
place
that
i
think
would
not
be
covered
might
be
some
wasteland
in
antarctica
and
i
suppose
most
of
those
are
now
claimed
by
the
countries
of
the
world.
so
that
the
land
which
is
very
apt
to
cover
everybody
who
goes,
who
put
themselves
under
the
jurisdiction
of
another
country
either
on
a
ship
of
another
country
or
on
a
--
on
land
territory.
to
mention,
i
have
talked
a
bit
on
this
rebuttal
of
dual
nationality
which
was
also
brought
out,
aspect
to
which
it
would
brought
out
in
colloquy
of
mr.
davis
and
the
members
of
the
court,
but
i
would
like
to
say
several
--
few
more
things.
every
country
in
the
world
allows
a
person
to
renounce
his
nationality.
mendoza
could
have
renounced
his
mexican
nationality;
he
wasn't
compelled
to
retain
his
mexican
nationality.
so
that
i
think
that
really,
there's
no
substance
to
the
argument
that
it
was
imposed
upon
him
willy-nilly
and
that
he
had
to
have
it.
he
could
have
renounced
his
mexican
nationality
but
instead
of
renouncing
his
mexican
nationality,
he
sought
to
use
it.
he
went
to
mexico.
and
the
reason
why
dual
nationality
is
so
important
and
not
just
an
accident
or
freak
in
these
cases
is
that
it's
because
people
with
dual
nationality
have
a
better
chance
of
going
to
other
countries.
if
a
man
named
smith
from
vermont,
who
is
not
a
national
of
mexico,
arrives
at
the
mexican
border,
he
won't
get
in
ordinarily.
mr.
mendoza-martinez
gets
in
because
he
claims
mexican
nationality.
so,
it's
inherent
in
the
problem.
it's
not
freak
or
an
accident
that
people
of
dual
nationality
have
a
greater
chance
of
going
to
other
countries.
i
don't
need
to
say
that
they're
the
only
ones
because
they
aren't,
but
they
do
have
a
greater
chance
and
this
was
an
actual
effect
that
a
major
part
of
the
problem
of
which
congress
was
dealing
and
the
appellee
here
did
choose
to
take
advantage
of
his
mexican
nationality
and
go
to
mexico.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes
sir.
oh,
at
the
moment?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
--
may
i
clear
something
here,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
the
phrase
a
period
declared
by
the
presidency,
a
period
of
national
emergency
is
not
a
special
period
of
national
emergency
for
this
statute.
it's
a
general
period
of
national
emergency.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
that
the
last
two
lines
qualify
a
period
of
national
emergency
declared
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
a
general
and
i
cannot
answer
the
question.
i
think
we
are
still,
i
will
look
it
up
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
not
know
whether
we
are
now
in
such
a
period
of
national
emergency.
of
course
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
we
were
in
actual
war,
world
war
ii.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
which
would
figure
this
test
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
will,
sir,
yes
sir.
the
last
thing
that
i
might
mention
because
of
the
reference
of
counsel
to
the
fact
that
in
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
trop,
he
did
refer
to
this
statue
and
since
he
appeared
to
be
speaking
for
three
other
members
of
the
court,
i
think
it's
appropriate
for
me
to
point
out
that
in
mr.
justice
whittaker's
memorandum
in
the
perez
case,
he
explicitly
said
that
he
was
not
passing
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
401
(j)
which
was
also
involved
in
perez
and
he
neither
expressed
nor
implied
any
opinions
on
that
statute.
and
so,
i
think
it
can
be
fair
to
be
said
--
fairly
be
said
that
that
portion
of
the
chief
justice's
opinion
did
not
speak
for
mr.
justice
whittaker
who
had
explicitly
said
that
he
was
reserving
his
views
on
that
subject.
