chief
justice
earl
warren
from
birth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
that
theory
you've
just
announced,
could
you
do
the
same
if
a
man
fled
the
country
after
committing
any
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
there
are
many
countries
where
we
have
no
treaty
to
permit
extradition
in
taxation
cases.
did
the
--
did
the
congress
say
that
a
man
who
flees
to
another
country
to
avoid
paying
his
taxes
to
this
government
loses
citizenship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
--
you've
just
gone
that
way,
why
don't
you
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
don't
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
say
that
they
might
hand
them
over.
i
just
said
they
didn't
have
an
extradition
treaty
and
if
--
if
congress
could
then
in
your
opinion
deprive
the
man
of
his
citizenship
in
this
country
where
he
was
born
for
leaving
the
country
for
the
purpose
of
evading
taxes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
use
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
that
purpose,
wouldn't
any
person
whether
he
committed
a
crime
or
not
who
went
to
a
country
with
which
we
had
no
extradition
treaty
or
any
way
of
bringing
him
back
forfeit
his
citizenship
whether
he
commits
a
crime
or
not.
it
wouldn't
be
under
the
jurisdiction
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
whether
he
has
committed
any
wrong
before
he
left
to
go
to
that
place
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
curious
where
that
can
be
found?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
i've
just
been
wondering,
are
--
are
we
in
any
such
emergency
now
to
this
accident
applies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
language
is
what
i'm
referring
to
during
the
period
or
in
time
of
war
or
during
a
period
declared
by
the
presidency
to
be
a
period
of
national
emergency
for
the
purpose
of
evading
or
avoiding
training
and
service
in
the
land
of
naval
force
in
the
united
states.
are
we
--
is
there
a
presidential
order
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i'm
addressing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
would
--
would
you
let
us
know
place
as
a
matter
information
whether
we
are
operating
under
any
emergency
as
declared
by
the
president
whether
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whose
acts
would
apply
at
the
present
time
of
the
young
man
went
to
another
country
in
order
to
avoid
the
draft?
