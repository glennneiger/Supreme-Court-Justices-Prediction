mr.
thomas
r.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
risk
of
being
a
little
tedious,
it
may
be
useful
for
us
to
turn
back
to
the
exact
terms
of
the
remand
since
this
court
–
case
is
here
for
the
second
time.
it
was
sent
back
to
judge
jertberg,
the
sole
judge
in
the
northern
division
of
our
southern
district
in
california
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
trop
versus
dulles.
now,
it
has
been
said
more
than
once
here
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
and
i'm
sure
the
court
is
by
this
time
aware
that
in
trop
versus
dulles,
the
statute
that
was
held
unconstitutional
was
section
401
(g)
of
the
national
--
nationality
act
of
1940.
section
401
(g)
provided
that
in
time
of
war,
a
deserter
who
did
desert
could
lose
his
citizenship
for
that
act.
now,
the
court
is
asked
to
consider
section
401
(j)
which
provides
that
a
citizen
deserter,
a
potential
soldier
who
deserts
before
he's
even
gotten
to
the
--
to
the
military
service
who
leaves
the
united
states
or
remains
outside
the
united
states
may
also
lose
his
citizenship.
and
i
--
i
submit,
i
hope
i
do
not
exhibit
temerity
by
suggesting
that
if
congress
had
simply
provided
for
the
loss
of
citizenship
in
the
case
of
draft
evasion,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
the
key
element,
the
element
that
causes
this
to
be
an
issue
before
this
court
is
departing
or
leaving
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
draft
evasion.
now,
if
this
is
the
case,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
all
of
the
facets
that
we
have
considered
and
mr.
davis
has
eloquently
spoken
on
it
can
be
considered
in
the
light
of
that
single
element
is
departing
from
or
leaving
the
united
states
a
distinction
with
or
without
a
difference.
is
it
a
distinction
that
should
cause
this
court
to
reverse
the
result
in
(inaudible).
the
first
part
considered
by
the
government
in
its
discussion
and
i
think
properly
is
the
foreign
affairs
power.
in
considering
whether
or
not
this
element
of
departing
and
remaining
outside
the
united
states
introduces
into
this
statute
a
new
element
which
should
persuade
this
court
to
hold
the
statute
constitution
--
constitutional
after
having
held
section
401
(g)
unconstitutional.
in
considering
that,
i
suggest
that
we
first
again
perhaps
at
the
risk
of
being
a
little
tedious
can
look
directly
at
the
language
of
the
statue
itself.
departing
from
or
remaining
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
is
the
language.
i
submit
your
honors,
if
congress
had
truly
had
in
mind
the
foreign
affairs
power,
it
never
would
have
employ
--
employed
such
awkward
and
negative
language.
i
do
not
mean
to
be
facetious
but
it
is
possible
to
violate
401
(j)
simply
by
crossing
the
international
boundary
in
lake
michigan
to
avoid
a
pursuing
federal
authority.
it's
possible
to
violate
it
by
going
to
some
totally
uninhabited
land.
if
congress
had
truly
had
in
mind
the
foreign
affairs
power
when
it
considered
and
passed
section
401
(j),
i
submit
that
it
reasonably
could
have
been
expected
to
use
some
language
like
entering
in
to
or
remaining
in
a
foreign
state
or
a
language
which
would
have
that
same
result.
in
both
the
mackenzie
and
perez
cases,
there
was
that
--
an
element
which
does
not
exist
here.
the
purpose
in
those
two
cases
was
to
separate
citizens
from
non-citizens.
no
counsel
appearing
before
this
or
any
other
court
to
my
knowledge
has
suggested
any
other
way
in
which
one
could
--
the
government
reasonably
could
be
expected
to
have
separated
--
i'm
sorry,
to
have
effectuated
the
power
of
the
government
to
tell
who
was
the
citizen.
it
has
to
establish
standards.
therefore
in
perez
and
mackenzie,
there
is
a
unique
element.
congress
chose
the
sole
available
remedy
to
it.
in
contrast,
if
we
are
considering
the
foreign
affairs
power
here,
i
submit
that
no
such
situation
obtains
with
respect
to
draft
evasion.
if
the
wrongdoer
who
was
in
fact
a
subject
to
punishment,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
was
available
the
usual
scheme
of
conventional
penal
remedies
that
there
is
nothing
unique
in
the
--
in
the
fact
of
expatriation
which
was
particularly
necessary
to
effectuate
this
congressional
purpose.
therefore,
for
the
first
time,
congress
has
departed
from
a
principle
which
i
submit
it
has
hitherto
adhered
to
and
that
is
let
us
not
take
away
citizenship
unless
it
is
the
sole
means
of
accomplishing
our
purpose.
now,
whether
it
is
penal
in
this
in
the
technical
sense,
i
will
consider
with
your
permission
in
a
moment.
the
next
question
with
respect
to
the
foreign
affairs
power
is
one
which
was
raised
by
two
members
of
the
court
in
interrogation
on
oral
argument
by
the
government
and
that
is
how
does
this
coercion
actually
facilitate
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
as
a
practical
matter,
what
does
it
achieve?
if
the
united
states
is
having
trouble
with
mexico,
does
it
really
make
things
any
easier
for
mexico
to
take
away
the
citizenship
of
the
people
who
had
used
mexico
as
a
refuge
from
the
draft
act?
i
submit
on
the
contrary,
if
the
court
please,
that
it
has
created
a
problem
of
some
proportions
for
mexico.
what
is
the
status
of
these
people
who
are
here?
they
may
or
not
be
citizens
of
mexico.
as
i
suggested
in
my
brief,
they
may
be
named
jones
and
they
may
come
from
vermont.
now,
what
have
we
done
to
mexico
to
create
these
stateless
wanderers
within
its
boundaries?
how
have
we
facilitated
the
relationship
of
our
government
with
theirs?
and
in
that
same
connection,
i
suggest
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
in
concrete
terms
that
has
been
suggested
to
this
court,
which
even
remotely
implies
that
there
is
any
real
problem
in
foreign
relations
created
or
potentially
available
because
of
the
existence
draft
evaders
in
a
foreign
land.
what
really
is
the
problem?
now,
counsel
in
his
brief
has
--
has
very
ably
discussed
the
early
problems
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
impressments
of
foreign
sailors
which
brought
about
in
part
the
war
of
1812.
what
is
that
something
that
we
are
really
faced
with
today
as
a
practical
matter?
i
think
implicitly
and
i'm
putting
words
in
counsel's
mouth,
but
i
think
implicitly,
he
admits
that
the
problem
doesn't
exist.
that
in
judge
jertberg
words,
they
are
no
different
than
ordinary
tourist
as
far
as
their
practical
impact
on
the
government
of
mexico
is
concerned,
but
seeing
that
gap
in
their
argument,
the
government
hastens
to
say,
but
the
united
states
may
run
in
to
trouble
when
it
seeks
to
get
these
people
back.
now,
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
and
i
will
merely
suggest
in
passing
here
the
fact
suggests
that
the
united
states
is
in
a
position
of
having
to
--
to
act
without
volition
that
it's
forced
in
to
a
position
where
it
must
create
problems
with
the
government
of
mexico
or
whatever
government
may
be
involved,
but
i
suggest
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
your
honor
that's
true.
there
have
been
difficulties
from
time
to
time
but
i
know
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
true,
your
honor
in
the
time
of
--
of
general
pershing
in
1912
as
recently
as
that.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
but
i
suggest
that
now,
those
problems
are
even
remotely
connectible
with
the
presence
of
any
kind
of
american
citizen
on
mexican
soil
on
a
peaceful
basis
much
less
specifically
the
draft
evader.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
i
mean
in
terms
of
history
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
that
there
would
not
be,
i
said
that
there
have
not
been.
i
didn't
mean
to
state
it
that
way.
and
so
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
no
distinction
to
be
made
here
between
this
case
and
the
trop
case
by
virtue
of
the
existence
of
the
provision
for
departing
from
or
remaining
outside
of
the
united
states
as
far
as
the
war
power,
i'm
sorry,
as
far
as
the
foreign
affairs'
power
is
concerned.
but
we
must
of
course
consider
whether
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
made
in
terms
of
the
war
power.
the
government
seems
to
rest
its
case
in
chief
on
the
argument
that
this
is
the
only
effective
way
to
reach
the
draft
evader
who
has
left
the
country
or
to
state
it
differently
in
the
terms
that
i
have
suggested,
departing
from
and
leaving
the
united
states
does
introduce
a
new
element
in
to
the
case,
which
makes
this
case
distinguishable
from
trop
because
we
have
here
a
man
who
cannot
be
reached
by
the
ordinary
penal
remedy.
that
seems
to
be
the
thrust
--
the
main
thrust
the
burden
of
the
governments
argument.
i
suggest
to
the
court
in
the
first
place
that
if
we
descend
to
the
world
of
practicality
and
imagine
our
draft
evader
in
concrete,
whether
he'd
be
in
mexico
or
any
other
foreign
state,
if
he
intends
to
remain
there
or
if
any
event
--
in
any
event
he
has
given
up
any
intent
whatever
of
returning
to
the
united
states,
he
isn't
going
to
be
in
the
least
impressed
with
his
loss
of
citizenship.
why
should
he
care?
he
has
made
a
basic
decision.
the
government
nowhere
has
pointed
that
any
example
of
a
refugee,
a
refugee
from
a
federal
penal
statute
who
actually
went
to
a
foreign
agency
of
the
united
states
and
enlisted
their
aid.
it's
true
that
the
government
has
pointed
to
a
situation
in
1863
where
certain
persons
outside
the
united
states
were
enlisting
the
aid
of
the
state
department,
but
the
government
very
quickly
added
in
candor
because
it
wrote
a
candid
and
forthright
brief,
it
added
that
there
was
no
penal
statute
which
imposed
any
penalty
for
draft
evasion
at
that
time.
with
that
single
exception,
the
government
has
pointed
in
no
case
where
anybody,
whether
they
were
trying
to
avoid
taxes
or
that
is
conviction
for
taxes
or
whether
they
were
under
a
sentence
for
a
murder
under
a
federal
statute
or
whatever
the
statute
might
be,
no
case
where
such
a
person
in
a
foreign
land
has
relied
on
his
united
states
citizenship.
i
submit
to
the
court
at
the
time
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
but
your
honor,
did
mr.
blackmore
rely
on
his
united
states
citizenship
in
connection
with
his
refuge
in
paris,
or
did
he
simply
rely
on
his
refuge?
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
it's
true.
i
--
i
have
no
doubt
that
that's
true
in
that
and
other
cases.
i
was
saying
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
time
when
the
refugee
is
going
to
begin
to
rely
on
his
united
states
citizenship
again
is
the
day
he
decides
to
return
and
when
he
approaches
this
border
and
asked
again
that
they
admitted
in
to
the
united
states,
he
is
as
subject
as
he
ever
was
to
the
conventional
penal
statutes
that
are
available.
if
what
i
have
said
is
true,
the
use
of
expatriation
as
a
coercive
force
is
totally
ineffective.
the
man
who
is
drawn
for
good
won't
care,
the
man
who
is
coming
back
and
be
punished
much
more
drastically
and
immediately
and
effectively
by
conventional
penal
statutes.
and
i
wonder
also
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
how
this
statute
actually
did
help
the
war
effort?
taking
for
a
moment
the
argument
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
trop,
it
was
totally
ineffective
in
the
case
of
desertion.
by
what
magic
did
it
suddenly
become
of
effective
in
the
case
of
draft
evasion?
what
is
the
essential
difference
in
that
respect?
how
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
true
your
honor,
but
my
argument
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
your
honor,
i'm
familiar
with
your
position
in
that
regard
and
i
would
say
that
my
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
--
my
argument
mr.
justice
goes
to
the
question
of
the
existence
of
a
rational
nexus
to
put
it
in
your
terms.
i
submit
that
the
thing
is
so
tenuous
and
remote
to
use
the
words
of
the
trial
court
as
to
import
the
absence
of
a
rational
nexus.
and
if
we
want
them
back,
if
we
want
these
draft
evaders
back
who
have
escaped
to
various
corners
of
the
world,
how
are
we
going
to
effectuate
our
purpose
by
making
sure
that
they're
not
citizens
of
the
united
states
anymore
and
are
permanently
and
for
all
time
beyond
our
reach.
the
purpose,
the
traditional
purpose
of
the
draft
act
has
always
been
to
use
every
persuasive
force
to
bring
the
offender
back
in
to
the
fold
and
indeed
as
the
government
itself
points
out
by
way
of
a
footnote
i
believe
on
page
26
of
its
brief
under
the
conventional
penal
statute
as
the
ordinary
offender
has
a
time
of
redress
when
he,
without
severe
punishment
may
still
enlist
in
the
armed
forces
and
i
submit
that
this
is
totally
at
odds
with
the
purpose
of
congress
to
raise
armies,
to
bring
together
a
vast
and
cohesive
force
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
the
war
power.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
if
there
is
deterrent,
i
agree
your
honor.
it
is
in
common
only
to
show
that
the
deterrent
does
not
in
fact
exist.
part
of
my
prior
argument
was
directed
towards
that.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
another
duty
of
mine
your
honor
which
is
separate
to
consider
the
penal
whether
the
statute
is
penal
and
if
it
is
penal,
then
to
consider
the
question
of
due
process
and
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
i
was
for
the
moment
restricting
myself
to
the
two
powers
that
we
were
considering
and
it
brings
me
to
that
point
your
honor.
i
had
not
intended
in
this
time
allotted
to
me
to
deal
at
length
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
penal.
four
members
of
this
court
speaking
through
the
chief
justice
held
that
in
trop,
the
use
of
--
of
expatriation
to
punish
the
deserter
was
a
penal
statute.
mr.
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
your
honor
and
i
would
be
glad
by
way
of
parenthesis
to
take
up
that
specific
question
at
this
point
because
i
do
think
it
has
become
particularly
relevant.
if
the
court
please,
dual
nationality
and
this
is
a
classic
case,
may
or
may
not
be
the
result
of
the
choice
of
the
individual
concerned.
in
the
case
of
mendoza,
he
was
governed
by
the
law
of
the
blood.
if
your
mother
and
father
were
born
in
mexico,
you
are
a
mexican.
mr.
mendoza
never
had
a
chance
to
decide
whether
he
wanted
to
be
a
citizen
of
mexico
or
not.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
or
in
the
stipulations
to
show
that
he
ever
evidenced
voluntarily
a
desire
to
be
a
citizen
of
mexico
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
any
foreign
parliament
or
authority
arbitrarily
to
create
within
this
country
a
separate
and
second
class
of
citizens.
the
english
parliament
could
declare
that
everybody
up
to
the
third
generation
of
descent
were
citizens
of
england
if
they
wanted
to,
subject
of
the
crown.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
there
is
no
question
about
that
your
honor,
but
i
submit
equally
that
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
mendoza
ever
availed
himself
of
his
citizenship.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
true
your
honor.
but
if
we
do
relate
it
to
this
case,
mendoza
could
as
well
have
been
named
smith
and
still
have
used
mexico
as
his
place
of
refuge.
he
has
not
thereby
made
any
special
use
of
dual
nationalities
simply
because
he
went
across
the
border
to
avoid
the
draft
authorities.
the
--
furthermore,
i
think
the
court
can
properly
consider
whether
or
not
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
if
without
any
choice
on
their
part,
one
group
of
our
citizens
can
be
made
a
special
class
of
citizens
who
may
be
expatriated
and
then
deported
by
an
act
of
congress
where
there
brother
citizens
may
not
and
where
the
decision
is
entirely
involuntary
and
per
force
it
must
be
when
the
decision
is
made
by
a
foreign
authority
or
parliament,
if
that
situation
exists,
then
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
pleases
the
court
that
there
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
have
thought
hard
before
i
answered
that
question
mr.
justice
and
i
do
deny
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
deny
that
congress
may
consider
as
to
natural
born
citizens,
in
any
respect,
in
any
respect
that
has
come
within
my
conception
or
it
can
that
congress
may
consider
as
a
separate
class
these
people
who
have
been
vested
with
a
second
citizenship.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
i
didn't
think
it
did.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
i
had
under
---
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
have
under
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
if
the
court
please,
i
did
understand
your
question
but
i
answered
it
ineptly.
my
answer
is
no.
as
to
natural
citizen
--
natural
born
citizens
of
the
united
states,
citizens
who
were
born
here,
i
deny
that
congress
may
consider
in
any
aspect
their
dual
nationality.
there
is
also
before
this
court
in
the
briefs,
an
extensive
discussion
of
whether
or
not
there
was
here
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
whether
there
was
due
process
of
law
or
not,
however,
depends
on
the
preliminary
consideration
of
whether
first,
this
was
a
penal
statute.
it
is
a
question
which
has
been
discussed
on
both
sides
extensively
in
the
briefs
but
i
submit
in
the
first
place
that
we
can
escape
that
result
on
the
basis
of
trial.
aside
from
the
merits
of
the
issue
that
four
members
of
this
court
not
only
found
it
was
punishment
but
found
it
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
mr.
justice
brennan
refraining
from
entering
directly
in
to
the
sphere
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
very
definitely
found
that
it
was
penal
and
called
in
effect,
species
all
over
those
arguments
which
termed
it
merely
regulatory.
i
am
not
unaware
of
the
fact
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
man
personally
suffers
from
an
act
of
congress
does
not
per
se
make
it
penal.
but
there
is
much
more
here.
this
is
a
--
an
act
in
the
first
place
for
which
this
man
went
to
jail.
in
the
second
place,
he
–
it's
used
in
essence
for
coercion.
there's
no
pretense
here
that
we're
separating
citizens
from
noncitizens
as
we
listen
to
able
counsel
for
the
government
it
was
overwhelmingly
evident
that
the
sole
purpose
was
to
coerce
this
man
not
to
do
what
he
might
have
in
his
mind
to
do.
the
purpose
was
punishment
and
the
discussion
that
the
chief
justice
set
out
in
the
--
in
his
opinion
in
trop
in
which
he
spoke
to
four
members
of
the
court.
he
made
particular
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
purpose
in
401
(g)
in
the
case
of
desertion
as
it
is
here
was
undeniably
that
stopped
somebody
from
doing
what
they
are
about
to
do
or
to
punish
them
so
that
others
would
be
deterred
in
the
event
that
they
did
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well
your
honor,
there
may
be
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
your
honor,
congress
may
act
with
a
coercive
intent
and
yet
act
ineffectively
and
that
is
my
contention
here.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
ineffectively
your
honor
more
than
anything
else
because
the
offender,
if
he
is
going
to
be
affected
at
all
is
going
to
be
affected
when
he
returns
to
the
united
states.
if
he
has
no
intention
of
coming
back
here,
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
care
anyway.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
if
the
court
pleases,
the
question
is
almost
philosophical
in
character
and
at
the
risk
of
--
of
giving
a
small
answer
to
a
large
question
that
there
was
a
finding
of
at
least
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
trop
that
the
use
of
it
there
in
the
case
of
desertion
where
there
was
no
reason,
we
didn't
even
have
a
question
of
leaving
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
that
it
was
there
an
ineffective
deterrent
and
it
is
my
contention
here
that
it
was
ineffective.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
within
large
limits
if
--
if
your
honor
please,
but
there
comes
a
point
when
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
comes
to
test.
now,
the
position
taken
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
others
of
this
court
as
to
the
scope
within
which
the
congress
may
act
as
to
the
necessary
and
proper
clauses
that
it
is
large.
other
members
of
the
court
have
evidenced
a
feeling
that
the
scope
of
congress
is
not
so
large
that
there
must
be
a
really
reasonable
connection,
a
really
reasonable
expectation,
if
your
honor
please,
of
results.
otherwise,
within
that
very
scope
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
and
nowhere
else,
this
court
has
the
right
to
hold
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
now,
i
have
omitted
the
contention
and
i
should
not
omit
it
that
this
statute
is
penal
in
its
character
because
of
its
traditional
alliance
with
the
ancient
punishments
of
banishment
and
of
ostracism.
and
as
a
final
point
in
that
connection,
i
submit
that
it
--
it
leaves
(inaudible)
the
contention
of
--
this
is
a
regulatory
power
when
we
consider
the
true
most
of
recorded
history,
banishment
and
ostracism
and
in
the
end
this
comes
to
nothing
but
that
with
the
harshest
among
the
harshest
and
least
humane
of
punishments
that
were
used
by
early
man
and
the
abandonment
of
those
punishments
has
been
considered
to
be
an
act
of
enlightenment
or
triumph
of
civilization.
now,
if
the
court
should
adapt
my
contention
that
we
are
in
fact
dealing
with
a
penal
statute,
then
we
come
squarely
face
to
face
with
the
express
position
expressed
by
the
chief
justice
for
three
other
members
of
the
court
in
trop
that
section
401
(j)
was
dictum
in
a
sense
was
lacking
even
the
rudiments
of
procedural
due
process
of
law.
yet,
before
anybody
did
anything,
the
citizenship
was
drawn.
there
was
--
there's
no
--
even
a
provision
--
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
under
401
(g)
at
least
there
was
a
court-martial.
somebody
considered
whether
or
not
the
man
had
done
the
act
in
question.
in
the
present
case,
there's
just
a
naked
statement
that
one
who
leaves
the
united
states
or
remains
there
for
the
purpose
of
draft
evasion,
ipso
facto
loses
his
citizenship.
the
first
answer
given
by
the
government
to
that
is
of
course
to
rely
on
section
503,
which
gives
a
right
to
declaratory
relief
and
was
in
fact
the
section
under
which
this
present
action
was
brought,
but
as
previous
questions
i
believe
by
mr.
justice
stewart
have
already
brought
out,
there
is
no
provision
here
for
trial
by
jury
or
the
other
careful
protections
that
are
given
in
the
case
of
a
truly
penal
statute.
and
on
this
particular
point,
i
invite
the
court's
careful
attention
to
a
letter
which
counsel
himself
cited
in
his
argument.
it
is
set
forth
for
the
court's
convenience
as
an
appendix
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
a
letter
--
a
letter
from
attorney
general
bill
which
is
entitled
circular
number
3893
department
of
justice
december
5th,
1944.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
at
the
end
as
an
appendix,
mr.
chief
justice.
attorney
general
biddle
expressly
provides
for
a
simple
examination
of
the
file
if
the
court
please,
by
the
united
states
attorney
and,
“upon
the
termination,
this
is
by
the
united
states
attorney,
upon
determination
that
public
law
431
is
applicable,
he
shall
close
the
case”.
there's
never
going
to
be
any
trial
as
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned.
he
shall
close
the
case
and
notify
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
of
his
action.
in
the
second
paragraph
going
on,
“the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
will
thereupon
close
its
file
in
the
case
and
furnish
the
immigration
and
nationalization
service
for
the
information
pertinent
to
the
application
of
public
law
431”
and
to
add
something
there
of
my
own,
this
means
that
the
per
se,
the
subject
offender
is
now
become
an
alien.
it's
up
to
him
to
reverse
the
process
and
to
get
out
of
this
situation
that
the
government
has
put
him
in.
and
in
the
third
paragraph,
the
united
states
attorney
shall
notify
the
state
director
of
selective
services
of
the
names,
numbers
and
local
boards
of
all
such
closed
delinquency
cases
so
that
his
records
and
those
of
the
local
boards
may
be
appropriately
noted.
if
the
court
please,
i
submit,
the
united
states
has
evidenced
as
clearly
as
it
could
that
it
intended
a
summary
procedure
for
the
depravation
of
citizenship
which
could
only
be
redressed
after
the
fact
and
assuming
that
the
man
was
in
a
position
somehow
to
invoke
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
this
court
well
knows
that
there
has
been
considerable
difficulty
as
an
independent
issue
about
that,
but
assuming
that
he
can
get
in
to
the
court,
he
gets
there
under
a
civil
proceeding
in
which
the
burden
is
on
him
to
prove
that
he
is
a
citizen,
not
upon
the
united
states
to
prove
that
he
is
not.
i
thank
the
court.
