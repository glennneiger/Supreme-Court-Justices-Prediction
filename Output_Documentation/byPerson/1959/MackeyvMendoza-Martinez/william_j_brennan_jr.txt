justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
well,
i
gather
that
the
fact
i
gather
from
this
fellow
had
been
convicted
was
he
not
of
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
--
that's
not
significant
to
your
argument,
then
i
gather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
one
thing
that's
puzzles
me
about
this
last
argument
is
this
statute
cuts
them
lose
in
america
as
soon
as
you
go
to
the
other
country
does.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
suppose
that
would
mean
we
wouldn't
want
them
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
don't
quite
understand
how
this
can
play
over
this

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
think
they
would
be
mad
that
we're
casting
loose
americans
that
we
don't
want.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
where
--
where
--
where
does
that
lie?
where
is
the
possibility
of
foreign
embroilment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
for
the
other
nation
get
little
upset
that
we
didn't
do
something
to
bring
him
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
may
not
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
suppose
mendoza
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
the
government
argue
overall
that
the
adding
of
flight
to
mexico
might
be
taken
as
evidence
of
the
voluntary
surrender
towards
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
preliminary
act
duration
or--
