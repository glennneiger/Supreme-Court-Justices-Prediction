well,
may
i
just
ask.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
initial
charge
was
of
conspiracy
to
evade
which
as
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
was
not
one
upon
which
a
conviction
could
be
found
unless
there
had
been
a
subsidiary
conspiracy
after
march
1953
or
in
a
subsidiary

justice

after
1953?
justice
william

1946.
now,
what's
the
ultimate
--
what
was
the
ultimate
theory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
an
overt
act
sometime
after
1946.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
alternate
theory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
telling
us
that
at
the
trial
originally,
they
tried
the
case
as
if
an
agreement
with
you
that
the
period
ran
from
march
1946,
unless
there
was
a
subsidiary
conspiracy
on
or
after
that
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now,
you're
saying
that
their
alternative
theory
is
that
no,
it
didn't
date
--
the
statute
doesn't
date
from
march
1946,
but
rather
from
some
later
date
when
there
was
a
last
overt
act
in
--
pursuance
of
a
continuous
conspiracy

mr.
sellers,
may
i
ask
on
the
petition
rehearing
that
the
government
say
in
effect,
we
did
try
on
that
theory,
give
as
an
affirmance
you
were
wrong
to
have
the
verdict.

and
the
original
brief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you
do
on
the
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

to
the
end
then
of
having
an
affirmance?

well,
(voice

justice

--
what

what
confuses
me
is,
in
place
to
what
you
just
told
us
and
what
pointed
out
to
us
in
page
5
i
still
don't
understand
why
the
government
didn't
ask
on
rehearing
for
an
affirmance.
why
did
it
ask
for
a
new
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
(inaudible)
the
chief
justice
petitions
to
rehearing
because
you
filed
--

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
one
and
then
the
appellant
filed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sellers,
i
would
just
like
to
clear
one
last
thing
up
for
in
the
sequence
of
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
you've
now,
pointed
out
to
us
and
you're
continuing
with
the
other
evidences
of
it,
that
in
fact,
there
was
a
charge
on
the
continuing
conspiracy
theory
and
also
a
charge
that
submitted
by
the
defendant
on
the
subsidiary
conspiracy
here.
and
yet,
the
last
opinion,
do
i
correctly
read
it
of
the
court
of
appeals,
says
this.
“we
held
that
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
an
impermissible
theory.
the
jury
was
simply
not
properly
instructed.
as
we
noted
in
our
modifying
opinion,
the
indictment
was
sufficient
here
to
present
--
and
the
indictment
was
sufficient
to
present
an
alternative
theory.
furthermore,
the
record
contains
evidence
which
would
tend
dissent
--
sustain
proof
of
overt
acts
and
so
forth
in
that
theory.”
do
i
correctly
read
this
that
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
impression
that
the
case
had
been
submitted
to
the
jury
on
both
theories?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
the
last
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
second
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
second
opinion
makes
that
clear?
that's
on
your
petition
for
rehearing
then,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1965
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
question
about
the
indictment
doing
it,
but
the
question
is
whether
it
was
submitted
on
--
to
the
jury
on
the
alternative
theory
and
you've
been
giving
us
evidences
that
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
alternative
theory,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
don't
find
in
this
opinion
that
the
court
of
appeals
considered
to
that
and
submitted
on
two
theories,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
they've
heard
of
it
--
in
the
last
opinion,
they
indicate
that
it
had
not
considered
