when
did

when
does
the
grunewald
case
come
down
from
this
court
in
relation
to
the
argument
of
the
original
appeal
in
your
case?

no,

they

so-called,
alternative
theory?
justice
john

what
about
that
with
reference
how
they
could've
gathered
that
alternative

in

at

at
the
time
--
i
just
want
to
get
over
now
in
this
case,
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
grunewald
did
not
come
down
from
this
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
you
â€“
both
the
government
you
were
unaware
of
what
the
government
is
held
by
this
court
in
grunewald,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
was
the
atmosphere
in
which
this
charge
to
the
jury
was
made
on
the
theory
which
the
government
tried
to
develop?

the
krulewitch
case.
justice
john
m.

right
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
now,
when
you
brought
to
the
court
of
appeals
before
the
briefs
were
filed,
grunewald
had
come
down?
justice
john
m.

i
suppose
that
you

on

justice
john

you
say
the
government
did
not
argue
the
alternative
theory
originally
--
justice
john
m.

--
in
trying
to
distinguish
grunewald?
justice
john
m.

how
did
it
distinguish
grunewald?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
a
question?
justice
john
m.

supposing
one
reads
his

record
as
you

wouldn't

how
do
you
distinguish
this

perhaps,
i
didn't

the
