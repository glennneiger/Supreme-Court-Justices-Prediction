mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
chief
justice
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
this
case
presents
for
consideration
of
the
court,
two
issues.
one
involves
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
under
the
facts
in
this
case
and
the
other
involves
the
application
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
criminal
conspiracy
cases.
the
--
briefly
the
--
with
respect
to
the
first
issue,
the
record's
facts
are
that
the
petitioner
was
indicted
with
another
one
named
seijas
for
conspiracy
to
violate
the
section
145
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
that
is
that
conspiracy
to
attempt
to
evade
the
tax.
the
precise
method
of
attempted
evasion
was
described
in
two
--
four
subsections;
one,
merely
alleges
that
they
conspired
to
evade
without
designating
or
describing
any
means
by
which
they
would
attempt
to
do
so
and
the
second
subdivision
(d)
describes
a
sort
of
a
hybrid
violation.
it's
–
it
alleges
that
they
conspired
to
evade
--
to
violate
section
145
(b),
the
tax
evasion
statute
and
1001
of
the
criminal
code,
the
false
statement
statute,
conjunctively.
and
--
but
they
conspired
to
do
so
by
making
false
statements
and
presenting
false
records
to
revenue
officials.
now,
the
--
the
defendant
was
tried
alone
on
this
conspiracy
charge
and
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced.
he
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
where
the
conviction
was
reversed
with
directions
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
and
that
was
predicated
upon
the
defense
which
the
petitioner
urged
throughout
the
case
that
the
case
was
barred
--
prosecution
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
--
the
determination
of
that
question
as
the
case
developed
and
i
will
describe
it
a
little
more
in
detail
later,
briefly
it
turned
upon
the
question
whether
there
existed
in
the
case
evidence
of
the
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
--
to
--
which
would
prolong
the
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
character
that
had
been
described
in
the
krulewitch
and
grunewald
cases.
and
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
character
and
type
of
agreement
that
was
found
necessary
to
prolong
the
statute
of
limitations
in
those
two
cases
and
consequently
the
--
directed
the
judgment
of
acquittal,
said
that
the
--
that
the
--
it
was
error
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury.
now,
after
that
decision
was
rendered,
the
government
filed
what
it
denominated
a
petition
for
a
rehearing,
but
which
we,
the
petitioner
contends,
was
not
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
in
legal
contemplation,
although
so
denominated
that
it
presented
to
the
court
a
--
new
issues
for
determination
upon
which
it
thought
they
should
have
another
trial.
it
presented
a
--
an
issue
which
they
called
an
alternative
theory
which
it
said
could
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
case
would
have
been
tried
upon
that
alternative
theory.
and
they
did
not
challenge
the
correctness
of
the
one
conclusion
or
the
one
issue
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided,
namely
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction
on
the
theory
upon
which
the
case
was
tried
and
submitted
to
the
jury.
they
didn't
ask
that
the
reversal
shall
be
set
aside.
it
only
asked
that
instead
of
directing
the
judgment
of
acquittal,
that
the
opinion
should
be
modified
to
direct
a
new
trial.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
modifying
opinion,
merely
determined
that
there
was
evidence
on
the
record
which
would
have
sustained
this
so-called
alternative
theory
and
the
case
might
have
been
tried
on
that
alternative
theory.
that
was
the
language
of
the
modification
opinion.
your
honor
will
find
it
at
--
in
the
record
at
page
1936
to
1937.
the
court
concluded
and
said,
“it
now
appears
to
us
that
the
case
might
have
been
tried
upon
this
alternative
theory,
namely,
that
the
conspiracy
continued
past
the
filing
of
the
returns
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
tax
--
taxpayers
from
tax
prosecution.”
now,
it
--
the
court
did
not
say
that
it
was
at
the
--
that
they
found
that
it
had
--
was
an
error
in
his
formal
conclusion
that
there
was
lack
of
evidence.
it
didn't
--
that
they
had
--
no
contention
was
made
on
that
respect
and
it
didn't
make
such
a
finding.
and
this
new
theory
was
one
that
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
time
in
this
petition
which
they
call
the
petition
for
a
new
trial,
but
which
--
before
a
rehearing,
but
which
we
say
is
an
original
petition
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes,
we
say
in
legal
effect
it
was
a
--
an
original
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
say
it
was
a
legal
effect
of
that
as
such
an
original
proceeding,
because
the
case
was
not
tried
on
this
so-called
alternative
theory.
the
government
took
no
exceptions
to
the
theory
upon
which
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
didn't
object
to
those
--
to
that
theory.
it
did
not
request
submission
to
the
jury
of
any
instructions
predicated
on
this
alternative
theory.
and
so,
there
was
nothing
for
the
court
--
the
district
court
to
pass
upon
in
connection
with
this
question
of
the
availability
or
nonavailability
of
an
alternative
theory.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
with
respect
to
what?
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
sole
--
the
sole
contention
of
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
original
appeal
was
to
sustain
the
conviction
on
the
--
on
their
view
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
establish
this
subsidiary
agreement.
they
sought
to
sustain
the
conviction
and
they
only
urged
that
there
was
no
evidence
and
in
their
petition
for
rehearing
–
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand,
your
honor.
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no.
they
did
not
challenge
the
accuracy
of
the
instructions
as
given
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
in
the
first
appeal.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no,
we
did
not.
we
--
we
proposed
that
the
instructions
upon
--
which
were
ultimately
--
which
were
delivered
to
the
jury,
we
didn't
object
to
them
and
the
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no.
they
--
in
the
original
opinion,
they
--
they
merely
devoted
themselves
to
the
task
of
appraising
the
evidence
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction
upon
the
theory
with
its
--
upon
which
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
grunewald
--
when
the
case
was
tried
and
the
instructions
given,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
the
grunewald
came
down.
i
think
it
came
down
during
the
trial
and
the
court
was
fully
aware
--
it
was
made
aware
of
it
and
--
and
the
instructions
as
given,
were
patterned
after
the
rules
laid
down
in
krulewitch
and
in
the
grunewald
case.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
now,
the
decision
in
this
court
came
down
after
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
while
the
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
before
the
briefs
were
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
before
the
briefs
were
written
and
the
government,
in
its
brief,
discusses
the
--
refers
to
and
discusses
the
supreme
court
decision
in
the
grunewald
case
and
not
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
they
did
not
present
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no.
they
did
not
present
it
in
the
brief
and
they
did
not
present
it
in
the
oral
argument
and
this
alternative
theory
which
is
now
predicated
on
the
beacon
brass
case,
the
beacon
--
the
beacon
brass
case
wasn't
even
mentioned
in
the
court
of
appeals,
until
the
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
grunewald
case
had
dealt
with
an
alternative
theory.
the
difficulty
--
the
difference
was
that
in
grunewald
both
theories,
the
theory
of
the
scope
of
the
conspiracy
as
contended
for
by
the
petitioner
--
by
the
defendant,
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
court
submitted
the
alternative
theory
of
the
scope
of
the
conspiracy
as
the
government
contended.
both
were
submitted
to
the
court.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
if
there
was
evidence.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes.
we
asked
for
the
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
in
the
--
in
the
court,
it
didn't
challenge
it,
it
didn't
--
expressly
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
i
--
i
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
i
was
associated
with
mr.
mead.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
i
have
to
correct
your
honor's
premise
--
for
a
moment
before
answering
the
question.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
--
the
instruction,
as
it
was
submitted,
was
predicated
on
the
proposition
that
an
attempt
to
evade
had
been
committed
when
false
return
was
filed
in
march
15th.
then
it
went
further
and
that
was
our
view
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
grunewald
and
the
decision
at
krulewitch,
and
that
went
further
according
to
our
requested
instruction,
unless,
the
jury
could
also
find
from
evidence
that
there
was
an
express
original
agreement
between
the
conspirators
to
continue
to
act
in
concert,
to
conceal
the
offense
--
the
offense
and
the
conspiracy
to
prevent
detection
after
the
offense
came
to
life.
if
there
was
such
an
agreement,
why
of
course,
the
statute
would
be
extended
and
that
was
the
instructions
given.
that
--
that
was
--
i
briefed
it
a
little,
but
that
--
that's
the
essence
of
the
instruction.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
substantially
in
the
language
proposed
in
our
request.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no.
nobody
raised
the
question
of
error
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
instruction
as
given.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that
was
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
character
and
quantity
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
to
sustain
the
theory
of
the
instruction.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no,
not
necessarily
your
honor.
we
first
moved
for
judgment
of
acquittal
because
there
was
no
evidence
sufficient
to
submit
to
the
jury
on
this
subsidiary
conspiracy,
but
when
the
court
ruled
against
us
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
the
trial
court
i'm
talking
about,
ruled
against
us,
we
were
--
were
forced
of
the
necessity
of
limiting
the
--
the
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
by
--
on
the
--
on
the
court's
assumption
that
there
was
evidence,
but
that
does
not
--
did
not
preclude
us
from
continuing
to
maintain
our
position
that
there
was
no
evidence
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
on
this
subsidiary
instruction.
so
that
the
mere
fact
that
we
requested
an
instruction
after
the
courts
declined
to
--
to
agree
with
us,
that
there
was
lack
of
evidence,
does
not
--
was
not
an
admission
by
us
that
there
was
evidence,
and
we
maintained
that
petition
and
that
was
the
basis
of
our
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
sustained
us
in
that
contention
that
there
was
no
evidence.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
that's
right
did
they
ask
for
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
they
took
that
position,
but
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no.
we
--
we
contended
that
instructions
should
not
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
case
should
not
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
at
all.
it
wasn't
a
question
of
the
accuracy
or
inaccuracy
of
the
instruction
as
given.
we
said
that
there
was
no
justification
for
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
at
all
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
because
there
was
no
evidence.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
well
that
--
that
was
the
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
we
contended
that
it
was
error
to
submit
the
case
because
there
was
no
evidence
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
warranting
submission.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no.
we
did
not
say
it
was
a
misleading
instruction.
we
said
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
we
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
we
--
we
did
not
argue
it
in
terms
of
misleading.
we
in
--
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
terms
that
it
should
not
have
been
--
the
case
should
not
have
been
submitted
at
all
for
lack
of
evidence.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
and
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
well,
lack
of
evidence
to
sustain
the
existence
of
the
subsidiary
conspiracy
which
alone
would
have
operated
to
extend
or
prolong
the
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
in
other
words,
the
statute
of
limitations,
its
application
depended
upon
whether
there
was
a
prolongation
or
whether
it
started
to
run
from
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
false
returns.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
it
was
march
15th,
1946.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes.
they
maintained
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
order.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
(voice
overlap)
case
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
they
came
in
after
the
court
found
that
we
were
entitled
as
a
matter
of
law
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal
at
the
hands
of
the
district
court.
but
through
the
fortuitous
circumstance
they
erroneously
failed
to
give
us
that
acquittal,
they
now
say,
we
ought
to
--
the
government
ought
to
have
another
chance
to
try
him
upon
another
theory.
and
in
the
--
and
it
is
conceded
here
that
this
theory
was
not
requested,
they
said
so
in
the
petition
for
the
new
trial
which
is
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
they
did
not
request
submission
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
government
did
not
request.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no.
we
didn't
--
we
contended
there
was
no
alternative
theory.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
oh,
i
--
i
see
what
your
honor
has
in
mind.
there
--
this
alternative
theory
is
not
to
be
confused
--
the
alternate
theory
that
is
being
urged.
now,
it's
not
to
be
confused
with
the
subsidiary
conspiracy
which
would
have
operated
to
prolong
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
alternative
theory
which
they
urge
was
on
theory
that
there
was
--
there
was
another
scope
of
the
conspiracy
which
contemplated
something
else
that
all
--
which
would
--
which
went
beyond
the
conspiracy
involved
in
the
instructions
as
given,
it
was
an
alternative
theory
which
is
--
was
being
superimposed
on
the
theory
embodied
in
the
instructions
as
given
and
they
wanted
an
opportunity
to
go
back
and
try
this
case
over
again.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
and
that's
the
case.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
now,
had
they
come
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
in
a
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
to
continue
to
act
in
concert
to
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
that's
the
–
after
1946.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
--
the
ultimate
theory
is
--
as
i
understand
it
and
i'm
--
frankly,
i
never
did
get
a
clear
understanding
to
what
we
they
were
trying
to
project,
but
they
said
we
can
disregard
the
filing
of
the
--
of
the
false
return
as
a
time
from
which
the
statute
had
commenced
the
run,
but
we
claim
merely
that
there
was
from
the
beginning
--
from
the
very
beginning,
merely
a
conspiracy
that
they
would
conceal
the
evasion
or
the
attempted
evasion
and
that
that
was
a
continuous
conspiracy.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that
was
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
the
alternative
theory
which
they
are
projected
for
the
first
time
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
now
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
before
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
they
said
--
and
in
their
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
frankly
stated
in
their
petition
and
the
petitioners
attached
as
an
--
an
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
on
the
--
in
our
position
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
they
expressly
stated
that
they
did
--
that
they
had
not
requested
--
that
the
case
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury
on
this
alternative
theory.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that
was
the
way
the
case
was
tried
and
the
way
it
was
submitted
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
and
they
acquiesced
in
it.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
now,
that's
what
they
projected
for
the
first
time
and
even
in
the
brief
in
this
court,
they
explained
the
--
at
page
22,
they
say
in
explaining
why
they
didn't
project
this
theory
in
the
trial
court
or
even
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
say,
at
that
point
the
government
trial
counsel
should
have
objected,
but
he
did
not
do
so.
i'm
reading
at
page
22
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
not
entirely.
we
also
tried
it
under
the
atmosphere
of
the
krulewitch
case
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
which
was
embodied
later
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
by
--
and
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
later
by
this
court
and
in
fact,
was
enlarged
upon.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes.
we
have
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
it
didn't
distinguish
grunewald
at
all.
they
were
--
they
devoted
themselves
--
themselves
entirely
to
establishing
that
there
was
evidence
sufficient
under
the
theory
embodied
in
the
--
in
the
instructions
as
given.
that
was
the
sole
position
of
the
government
on
the
original
appeal
until
they
presented
the
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
no,
it
was
the
former,
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
they
contended
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
there
was
evidence
prior
--
from
which
the
jury
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
could've
found
the
existence
of
this
alternative
theory.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
but
it
was
the
--
projected
at
that
time.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
now,
of
course,
the
case
--
the
court
of
appeals
and
appellate
courts
must
review
the
case
upon
the
theory
upon
which
it
was
tried
and
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
but
that's
true,
but
that
--
i
used
the
term
theory
upon
every
basis
upon
which
a
conviction
could
be
obtained.
that
for
example,
if
there
are
four
pieces
of
evidence
which
would
sustain
a
conviction,
they
can't
try
him
on
one
and
then
if
defeated,
indict
him
and
try
him
on
another.
they
--
upon
every
ground,
upon
all
evidence,
upon
all
phases
upon
which
a
case
could
have
been
tried
in
the
first
instance
--
which
theory
upon
which
the
court
must
review
it
as
it
was
submitted
and
that
is
particularly
true
in
a
criminal
case.
it
wasn't
a
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
we
--
we
do
not
agree
that
that
is
the
function
of
the
appellate
court
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
because
--
if
that
were
true,
then
the
government
--
the
court
of
appeals
could
remand
the
case
for
trial
--
retrial,
every
time
that
some
other
new
theory
is
projected
by
the
government.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
government
is
entitled
to
only
one
trial
to
try
the
case
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
once.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
this
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
in
order
to
--
is
to
follow
that
theory
would
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
emasculate
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
to
follow
that
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
--
we
take
for
example,
in
a
recent
case
of
aphet
and
old
cases,
members
of
this
court
have
--
have
stated
that
even
in
cases
where
a
single
offense
gives
rise
to
a
violation
of
several
statutes
while
he
maybe
subjected
to
multiple
penalties,
he
can
only
be
tried
once
and
if
he's
tried
more
than
once,
there's
a
violation
of
the
--
of
the
constitutional
protection
against
double
jeopardy.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
now,
if
he
is
tried
and
--
and
the
verdict
has
been
rendered
and
the
--
endorsement
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
the
government
has
denied
the
right
to
appeal
even
whether
they
--
whether
the
--
that
they
should
--
they
--
they
can't
cross
appeal,
they
can't
assert
--
assign
error
in
the
--
as
the
--
as
the
appellee
and
the
--
the
fact
that
they
are
denied
the
right
of
appeal,
all
of
these
denials
of
the
government
are
geared
to
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
that
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
when
he
was
tried
and
convicted
that
was
a
trial
and
he
was
either
subject
to
--
to
stand
convicted
or
--
or
discharged
from
it,
unless
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
is
predicated
merely
upon
errors
which
infect
the
trial.
as
for
example,
the
--
the
introduction
or
--
or
rejection
of
the
evidence
or
--
or
errors
in
instructions,
when
their
reversal
is
on
that
ground,
the
courts
have
held
that
that
vitiated
the
first
trial.
there
is
none
and
in
effect,
he's
--
didn't
have
a
fair
trial,
but
it's
a
defendant
that
rises
that
question.
he
is
seeking
the
new
trial
because
of
these
errors.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
but
when
--
may
i
just
conclude,
your
honor?
but
when
the
reversal
is
predicated
upon
the
ground
that
the
--
there
was
no
evidence,
the
warranting
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
it's
an
adjudication
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
judgment
of
--
of
acquittal
in
the
first
instance
and
that
the
--
then
in
that
situation,
the
court
of
appeals
must
give
him
the
relief
which
he
was
entitled
to
in
--
in
the
first
instance.
now
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes,
your
honor,
because
then
the
government
is
the
one
who
is
seeking
to
try
the
man
twice.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
it's
the
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
to
use
--
to
use
the
justice
douglas's
statement
in
the
sapri
case,
it's
just
asking
for
another
--
to
go
at
the
citizen,
i
think
that's
what
it
comes
to.
now,
when
the
--
otherwise,
he
can
be
tried
today
on
--
on
one
theory
as
it
was
submitted
to
the
court
and
the
government
seeks
to
sustain
that
conviction,
then
when
it's
defeated,
it
says,
“now
we
want
to
go
back
and
try
him
on
another
because
we
have
another
theory.”
and
the
court
of
appeals
says,
“go
ahead
and
try
it,
does
it
try
him
again.”
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
well,
i
would
limit
that
because
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
when
an
opinion
is
handed
down,
it's
not
immediately
final
because
there
exists
a
right
given
by
all
rules
of
court
to
apply
for
a
rehearing.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
and
that
was
done.
now
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
but
had
the
petition
been
in
legal
effect
a
--
an
application
for
rehearing,
we
recognize,
of
course,
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
say,
yes,
we
were
in
error.
we
thought
there
was
no
evidence,
but
our
attention
has
been
directed
to
this
piece
of
evidence,
or
that
piece
of
evidence
which
we've
overlooked
and
they
could
say,
“we
were
in
error”
and
so
we
revise
our
views.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
grunewald
case,
the
defendant
who
had
a
right
to
seek
a
new
trial,
moved
for
a
new
trial.
the
--
the
government
doesn't
have
any
rights
to
move
for
a
new
trial.
the
government
can't
move
for
a
new
trial
under
trial
of
court,
denied
that
right.
whether
the
judges
--
the
instructions
were
right
or
wrong,
or
whether
he
committed
the
error
in
the
instructions,
the
government
couldn't
have
moved
for
a
new
trial
in
the
trial
court.
and
it
couldn't
seek
a
new
trial
as
appellee
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
in
the
--
in
grunewald,
the
defendant
said
there
was
error
not
in
the
law
as
it
was
annunciated
or
as
submitted,
but
there
was
error
because
in
submitting
the
alternative
theory
to
the
jury,
it
hadn't
--
it
was
not
sufficiently
identified.
it
was
equivocal
and
the
jury
could
have
been
--
it
was
--
didn't
have
enough
yardstick
by
which
to
measure
or
distinguish
that
the
one
theory
from
the
other.
but
to
the
principles
of
law
were
sustained,
but
in
the
grunewald,
that
theory
was
submitted
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place.
the
court
was
then
reviewing
the
action
of
the
trial
court.
it
had
right
to
review,
had
jurisdiction
to
review,
but
if
when
a
--
when
a
matter
is
not
presented
to
the
trial
court
in
any
form
and
we
cite
numerous
cases
to
that
effect,
when
a
matter
is
not
submitted
to
the
trial
court
and
you
come
to
the
appellate
court
and
you
want
them
to
consider
that
question
for
the
first
time,
then
you're
invoking
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
its
particularly
improper
in
a
criminal
case
because
in
a
criminal
case,
the
--
the
court
of
--
the
government
can't
seek
a
relief
by
reason
of
errors
made
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
well,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
our
--
our
position
is
that
the
court
having
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
that
was
final,
unless
by
petition
for
rehearing,
they
were
able
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
they
--
that
they
overlooked
the
evidence,
but
it
couldn't
come
there
and
ask
the
court
to
entertain
a
new
theory
or
a
new
basis
for
indictment.
that
was
--
that's
our
--
our
view
and
the
--
we
cite
of
the
cases
in
our
brief
--
of
the
time
to
refer
to
them
all.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
we
say
--
but
we
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
that
new
phase
either
in
its
original
opinion
or
under
the
petition
for
rehearing,
because
it
was
not,
in
legal
effect,
a
petition
for
rehearing.
our
view
is
and
--
that
if
whenever
you
in
--
present
to
the
appellate
court
entirely
new
issue,
which
was
not
ruled
upon
in
the
court
below,
it's
no
longer
–
it's
not
a
court
of
review,
being
asked
to
try
a
case
de
novo.
that
is
what
it
--
what
it
amounts
to
and
that
particularly
(inaudible)
in
criminal
cases.
now
--
now,
the
--
they're
--
in
the
further
exemplifications
that
i
did
that
we
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
expressly
prohibit
the
reexamination
of
the
giving
of
instructions
or
the
failure
to
give
instructions
unless
they
are
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
exception
taken
and
if
in
the
case
of
failure
to
give
instructions,
there
is
an
absence
of
request
for
submission,
that
rule
precludes
review.
the
district
court
could
not
have
reviewed
its
instructions,
its
failure
to
give
instructions
involving
the
alternative
theory
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
under
this
rule
to
review
the
--
the
failure
to
give
instructions
embodying
theory
even
though
there'd
be
evidence
to
sustain
it.
now,
we
submit
--
of
the
--
here
correct
rule
of
what
is
laid
down
on
the
--
on
the
only
case
that
directly
passed
upon
this
subject
was
a
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
corn
case
as
to
what
power
the
court
of
appeals
has
upon
reversal,
whether
to
direct
an
acquittal
or
to
--
or
to
direct
a
new
trial.
whether
there's
that
discretionary
power
in
that
respect.
now,
that
court
held
squarely
that
there
was
no
discretion
in
that
situation.
that
if
the
defendant
was
entitled
at
the
close
of
the
government's
--
of
the
entire
case
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
that
became
vested
right,
an
accrued
right
that
it
had
and
it
can't
--
couldn't
be
taken
away
from
unconstitutionally.
and
therefore,
when
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
evidence
warranting
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury,
if
that
--
it
could
do
noting
else,
but
to
give
him
the
same
relief
and
the
same
kind
of
judgment
that
he
was
entitled
to
receive
at
the
hands
of
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance.
that
was
his
accrued
right
as
the
courts
put
it.
now,
the
court
in
that
case,
gave
a
good
deal
of
consideration
to
the
question
that
examines
the
authorities
at
length
and
came
to
that
conclusion.
and
i
haven't
found
any
case
in
which
the
force
of
the
reasoning
employed
has
ever
been
has
offset
--
the
value
that
court
as
--
as
precedent.
we
think
that
the
philosophy
of
that
case
ought
to
be
adopted
by
this
court.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
well,
i
--
apparently
they
do
here.
they
--
they're
here
claiming
that
the
court
had
--
had
a
discretion
to
direct
a
new
trial
under
these
conditions
that
prevail
here.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
the
only
--
your
honor,
through
--
they
say
that
of
course,
but
it
gets
us
back
to
the
question
of
whether
their
petition
that
they
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
presenting
this
new
theory,
if
they
call
it,
for
the
first
time,
was
in
reality
a
--
a
petition
for
rehearing.
if
they
were
in
--
in
legal
--
if
in
legal
contemplation,
they
were
asking
the
case
that
tried
--
the
court
to
try
the
case
de
novo
then
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
examine
the
case
or
to
entertain
that
petition.
and
i
say
they
have
no
jurisdiction
to
do
that
because
that
question
was
never
presented
to
the
trial
court
and
wasn't
presented
to
the
courts
in
the
first
instance
and
that's
kind
of
a
petition,
despite
the
fact
they
call
it
a
petition
for
rehearing,
must
be
considered
for
what
it
is
in
a
legal
effect,
a
petition
asking
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
new
trial
on
--
so
that
he
could
be
tried
on
the
theory
that
the
man
was
never
tried
on
before.
now,
i
want
to
reserve
it
particular
--
may
--
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
if
it
please
the
court,
i'm
--
i
don't
quite
understand
why
it
is
set
out
here
or
that
some
question
is
in
--
is
suggested
as
to
whether
this
alternative
theory
was
submitted.
i
want
to
read
from
the
petitioner's
petition
when
it
applied
what
(inaudible)
to
be
new
trial.
it
said,
“it
must
be
conceded
that
the
case
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury
in
accordance
with
the
theory
outlined
above.”
now,
the
government
knew
all
along
that
that
theory
had
been
submitted
and
so
told
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
applied
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
i
stated
--
it
says
that
in
the
government's
petition
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
they
sought
a
modification
for
--
to
remand
for
a
new
trial,
told
the
court
and
i'm
reading
from
their
petition,
it
must
be
conceded
that
the
case
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury
in
accordance
with
the
theory
outlined
above.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
yes,
that
--
they
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
--
the
kind
of
conspiracy
that
they
--
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
now,
as
your
honor,
it
was
also
--
it
was
also
asserted
here
that
at
least,
i
may
have
been
mistaken,
but
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
considered
and
decided
some
issue
other
than
the
question
whether
their
was
sufficient
evidence
to
submit
to
the
jury.
now,
here
this
is
the
concluding
statement
of
the
court
in
its
first
opinion.
and
it
reversed,
after
analyzing
krulewitch
and
grunewald
cases
and
the
kind
of
evidence
that
must
be
presented
to
establish
the
subsidiary
conspiracy
and
the
elements
of
such
a
conspiracy
which
included
that
first
that
the
evidence
must
be
direct,
that
it
must
be
an
expressed
original
agreement.
that
it
must
be
an
agreement
to
continue
to
act
in
concert
to
conceal
and
so
on.
after
discussing
all
that,
the
court
concludes
by
saying,
“the
policy
that
blocked
the
theories
stated
in
krulewitch,
blocks
this
one
also.”
in
other
words,
if
this
was
the
conclusion
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
it
was
the
only
issue
decided.
on
the
authority
of
this
decision
of
the
court,
we
hold
that
it
was
error
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury.
now,
it's
been
--
the
counsel
asserted
that
the
--
that
because
of
a
new
trial
was
directed
in
the
grunewald
case,
the
same
should
be
done
here,
i
saw
no
difference.
well,
there's
a
marked
difference,
a
very
important
difference.
in
grunewald,
they
were
not
confronted
with
the
constitutional
protection
against
double
jeopardy.
in
the
grunewald,
it
wasn't
the
government
that
was
seeking
a
new
trial.
in
grunewald,
the
defendant
appealed
and
the
defendant
sought
the
new
trial.
in
the
criminal
case,
the
defendant
--
the
--
the
government
has
no
right
to
a
new
trial
and
we
--
in
that
respect,
we
call
attention
of
the
court
to
justice
--
to
justice
cardozo's
statement
in
the
palko
case.
we
cited
at
page
23
of
our
brief.
he
said
the,
“it,
referring
to
the
fifth
amendment,
forbade
jeopardy
in
the
same
case,
if
the
new
trial
was
at
the
instance
of
the
government
and
not
upon
the
defendant's
motion.”
that's
the
problem
we
have
here.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
we
--
we
moved
for
a
new
trial
in
the
district
court.
mr.
solomon
j.
bischoff
well,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
make
distinct
request
for
relief
in
the
appeal.
your
honor
was
referring
to
the
relief
sought
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
distinctly
and
carefully
segregated
the
kind
of
relief
we
sought.
we
said
in
the
conclusion,
i'm
reading
from
page
109
and
when
your
honors
will
see
the
brief
with
counsel,
but
just
you'll
see
it
there
any
conclusion
that
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
directed
to
enter
judgment
of
acquittal,
if
reversal
is
based
on
any
of
classifications
that
they're
numbered
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
and
7.
now,
1
and
3
presented
the
questions
that
we've
been
discussing
here,
the
absence
of
evidence.
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
we
were
now
to
say,
if
reversal
is
based
on
specifications
of
error
numbered
6,
7,
9
and
10,
a
new
trial
should
be
ordered.
now,
those
presented
assignments
of
error
relating
to
errors
in
--
in
admission
of
evidence
and
so
on,
which
would
warrant
the
reversal
with
a
new
trial.
we
carefully
segregated,
so
we
would
not
be
construed
as
having
waived
our
demand
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
if
we
are
sustained
in
our
contention
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
we
took
our
precaution
and
in
the
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
governing
this
question
of
waiver,
we
call
attention
to
the
green
case
in
which
the
court
has
said
and
rejected
the
contention
that
the
taking
of
an
appeal
in
and
off
itself
is
a
waiver
of
the
constitutional
protection
and
throws
the
case
open
at
large.
that
called
--
this
court
called
attention
to
justice
holmes'
statement
in
which
he
said
that
a
waiver
must
be
knowingly
and
intentionally
made
that
can't
be
inferred,
that
there's
a
strong
presumption
against
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right.
it
called
attention
to
justice
mckenna's
statement
to
say
in
effect,
so,
we
can
see
no
reason
of
why
we
should
be
deemed
to
have
the
waived
a
--
the
constitutional
protection
because
we
exercise
the
perfectly
lawful
right
to
appeal.
after
(inaudible)
of
the
question
of
the
discretionary
power
to
remand
on
reversal
with
direction
for
judgment
by
acquittal
or
a
new
trial,
we'd
like
to
call
attention
to
the
copacus
case
decided
by
this
court.
we
cite
it
at
page
15
of
our
reply
brief
on
which
the
court
construed
what
was
formally
206
section
269
of
the
judicial
code,
which
is
roughly
called
the
harmless
error
statute.
it's
a
discretionary
statute
which
gives
the
courts
power
to
disregard
harmless
error
and
coming
to
an
ultimate
conclusion.
and
it's
a
--
in
that
respect,
it's
similar
in
its
operation
to
section
2106
of
the
judicial
code
which
is
relied
on
here
by
the
government
as
to
the
kind
of
relief
that
the
appellate
court
can
give.
the
court
--
this
court
said
that
in
construing
that
statute
while
it
confers
discretion,
there
must
be
no
departure
from
a
constitutional
norm.
well,
you're
confronted
with
that
constitutional
norm
in
a
criminal
case.
if
you're
going
to
say
that
you
have
discretion
to
direct
a
new
trial
even
though
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
case
was
entitled
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
right
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
--
in
the
trial
court,
then
you
(inaudible)
of
the
constitutional
protection
against
double
jeopardy.
we
think
the
same
principles
apply.
