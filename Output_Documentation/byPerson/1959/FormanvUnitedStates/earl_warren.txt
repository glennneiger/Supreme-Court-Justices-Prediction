chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bischoff,
may
i
ask
you
in
presenting
this
alternative
theory,
did
the
government
contend
that
there
--
there
was
evidence
sufficient
in
the
first
trial
to
sustain
them
on
that
theory
or
--
or
did
they
contend
that
if
--
if
permitted
to
retry
the
case,
they
could.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bischoff,
may
i
ask
you
this,
assuming
that
the
case
was
tried
on
the
theory
which
it
was
tried
and
with
the
charge
that
was
given
and
then
on
the
original
hearing
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
their
briefs,
the
government
set
forth
this
alternative
theory,
would
your
position
have
been
the
same
before
the
court
of
appeals
as
it
is
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
have
been

latest
overt
act

the
--
these
--
these
discussions
and
--
and
statements
to
the
revenue
officer,
you

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i

taxes
that
go
back
to

and
1943.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
--
was
there
a
--
a
period
of
six
years
between
these
transactions
that
you're
just
talking
about
now
and
the
last
overt
act
otherwise

where
is
that
to
be
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sellers,
you
haven't
quite
finished
your
chronology
and
you
got
to
--
you
got
to
the
point
where
the
decision
of
this
court
in
grunewald
came
down.
now,
what
date
was
that
and
then
what
happened
afterwards
in
your
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1958.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
did
you
treat
the
grunewald
issue
in

briefs
in
the
appellate
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
take
--
take
notice
in
your
briefs
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
grunewald?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
those
briefs
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
--
have
you
a
copy
of
them
that
you
could
submitted
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
do
that,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren

i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
we
would
--
we
would
like
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
if
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
--
was
the
charge
in
that
--
in
that
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
you
relying
on
that
theory
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
always
been
a
continuing
conspiracy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
sellers,
you
--
you
said
to
me
that
the
--
that
the
trial
court
first
correct
--
correctly
instructed
to
jury
and
then
you
said
that
the
petitioner
asked
for
further
instructions,
which
was
granted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
would
you
read
to
me
the
portion
on
the
court's
instructions
that
correctly
discharged
the
jury
on
your
--
on
your
theory.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sellers,
does
this
part
of
the
instruction
that
footnote
3
have
to
do
with
the
alternate
theory
to
--
at
bottom
of
the
page,
to
determine
whether
certain
alleged
overt
acts
were
committed
in
order
to
promote
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
applicability
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
with
respect
thereto,
you
must
first
determine
the
duration
of
the
conspiracy.
did
it
end
at
some
particular
time
or
was
there
also
an
agreement
between
mr.
seijas
and
mr.
forman
to
continue
concealment
after
1945
of
their
activities
relating
to

during
the
years

of
evading
the
income
tax
liability
of
mr.
seijas
--
well,
i'm
reading
at
the
bottom
of
page
4
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
your
brief
--
in
that
footnote
3,
to
which
you
referred
me
as
--
as
to
the
character
of
the
charge
made
by
the
--
seems
to
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
--
the
question
is,
as
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
court
instruct
them
just
on
the
one
theory
that
it
had
to
--
that
it
was
--
it
was
a
continuing
conspiracy
until
petitioner
injected
this
auxiliary
conspiracy
theory
in
to
it.
but
this
--
this
--
these
are
the
judges'
instructions
to
which
you
refer
me
and
doesn't
this
set
out
that
theory
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
says,
did
it
end
at
some
particular
time
referring
to
the
--
the
original
conspiracy
or
was
there
also
an
agreement
between
mr.
seijas
and
mr.
forman
to
continue
concealment
after
1945
of
their
activities
relating
to
the
amusement
company
earnings
during
the
years
1941
through
1945
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
income
tax
liability
of
mr.
seijas
and
mr.
--
mrs.
seijas
and
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it,
but
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
think
--
i
think
they're
more
of
the
--
the
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
that's
what
i'm
reading.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
guess,
you
said
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bischoff,
you
may
conclude.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
sellers
--
what
is
your
response
to
that
mr.
sellers,
if
i
may?
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
interrupt
just
a
moment
because
that's
been
bothering
me
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
--
will
you
state
it
again
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
a
continuing
conspiracy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
i
may
just
--
if
we
may
just
let,
mr.
sellers
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
you
may
proceed
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
for
now.
