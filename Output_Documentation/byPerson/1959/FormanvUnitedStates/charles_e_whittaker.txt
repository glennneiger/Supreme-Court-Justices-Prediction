justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
right
now,
it's
the
original
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeals
you
say?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
bischoff
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
the
instruction
upon
the
so-called
subsidiary
conspiracy
was
given
in
language
proposed
in
your
request,
was
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
who
raised
the
question
that
that
was
error
in
the
court
of
appeals,
did
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
is
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
reversed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
was
the
basis?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
sustain
the
theory
of
the
instruction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
could
you
raise
that
--
does
not
one
when
he
submits
a
charge
to
a
court
based
on
a
certain
set
of
facts,
thereby
admit
that
those
facts
necessary
to
support
that
instruction
do
exist?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
trial
court.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
theory
of
possible
question,
i
don't
understand?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
government
didn't?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
did?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
after
your
motion
for
the
record
first
was
not
and
the
court
was
--
committee
contained
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
bischoff
may
i
(voice

--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
your
client
could
put
in
jeopardy
only
one
time.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
when
did
his
initial
jeopardy
end
in
your
view?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
your
answer
to
my
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
your
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
your
answer
then
to
my
question
is
the
initial
jeopardy
ended
when
the
court
of
appeals
filed
with
the
clerk
its
original
opinion?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now
then,
you
therefore
say
that
that
became
a
final
judgment
in
acquittal
--
the
adjudication?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
was
done?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
was
done?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
sustained.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
government
--
the
government
doesn't
dispute
that
policy
does
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
saying
however,
that
the
ninth
circuit
never
did
far
--
never
did
has
between,
does
it
--
that
there
was
not
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
could
a
defendant
claim
prejudice
before
the
district
court
is
in
fact,
the
same
words
in
instruction
he
stressed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
the
court
has
given
on
the
motion?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
grunewald?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
here,
but
i
--
i
realized
here
is
given
at
the
request
of
petitioner.
this
--
let
me
just
see,
if
i
can
clear
up
the
cobwebs
in
mind.
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
indictment
was
adequate
to
sustain,
you've
raised
a
proof
for
that.
the
court
can
deal
dominantly
on
the
motion
for
rehearing
that
easily,
so
the
three
issues
give
way
to
that
the
charge
that
the
court
has
given
was
correct
up
to
the
point
where
you
added
to
the
thrust
of
the
defendant,
which
leaves
therefore
depending
on
which
by
that
you
agree.
well,
then
what
i
cannot
understand
is
why
--
what
the
defense
added
would
create
(inaudible)
when
everything
else
was
fine
(inaudible)
complain
not
to
ninth
circuit's
find
that
what
you
asked
for
and
got
places
him
to
the
place
where
he
was
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
understand
this
evidence
in
the
record
to
(inaudible)
must
conceive
that.
the
only
thing
--
i
think
that
you
would
--
and
i'm
wasting
your
time,
i'm
sorry,
i
just
don't
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
that
because
of
the
thrust
made
for
the
defendant
for
a
charge
to
support
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
all,
isn't
it?
