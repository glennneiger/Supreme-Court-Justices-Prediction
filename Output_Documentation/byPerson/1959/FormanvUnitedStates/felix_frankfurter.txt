justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
tell
us
what
the
government's
position
was
on
the
original
appeal
by
you
or
by
the
present
petitioner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
respect
to
anything.
what
was
the
government's
position
on
their
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all?
they
--
they
simply
urged
that
the
conviction
be
sustained,
if
they
defend
the
charge
in
the
original
hearing
of
the
appeal?
there's
some
question
about
the
propriety
of
--
of
the
charge,
is
there
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
there
--
isn't
there
some
question
as
mischarging
by
the
trial
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
that
was
wrong,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
appeals
disagreed
with
you
on
that,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
the
fact
that
the
so-called
subsidiary
conspiracy
instruction,
the
subsidiary
conspiracy
instruction
was
rested
--
was
--
that
would've
carried
the
statute
of
--
that
would've
the
period
beyond
the
statutory
cutoff,
would
it
not,
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
--
if
that
was
--
if
that
was
a
valid
--
if
that
was
as
relevant
and
appropriate
instructions
and
you
had
asked
for
that
instruction
at
the
trial,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
government
tried
to
sustain
the
conviction
on
the
assumption
that
the
subsidiary
conspiracy,
the
area
charged
was
a
proper
charge
in
this
case
and
it
rested
on
that,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
position
of
the
government
was
on
the
first
--
on
the
--
on
the
original
appeal,
before
the
rehearing
and
i
want
to
know
if
i'm
correct
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
--
if
i'm
correct
in
this
mr.
bischoff.
that
there
was
a
charge
given
at
your
request,
if
you
were
the
trial
counsel,
i
don't
know
who
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
if
petitioner's
counsel
at
the
trial,
asked
for
an
instruction
which
carried
the
period
beyond
the
present
controversy
--
controversial
cutoff
herein,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
was
an
improper
charge,
but
am
i
right
in
saying
that
the
government
tried
to
sustain
its
--
the
conviction
that
you
had
at
the
trial,
on
the
basis
of
the
propriety
of
that
charge,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
government
asked
for
affirmance
of
the
conviction
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
was
then
before
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
took
that
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
but
nobody
--
did
you
--
did
you
--
although
in
the
light
of
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
whittaker,
did
you
say
--
did
you
and
your
appeal
in
the
court
of
--
before
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
that
was
a
misleading
charge
to
the
jury
because
there
was
no
foundation
for
giving
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
to
be
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
if
--
if
a
court
gives
the
jury
an
instruction
which
has
no
foundation
in
the
record
and
that
instruction
would
mislead
the
jury
into
believing
that
they
could
find
on
the
basis
of
that
instruction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
did
not
--
you
did
not
make
that
argument,
did
you,
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
more
specifically,
you
did
not
say
that
the
jury
may
well
have
gone
to
the
jury,
they
have
considered
the
whole
--
everything
that
was
put
before
them
and
the
(inaudible)
somebody
say
that
judge
told
us
that
if
we
find
the
subsidiary
conspiracy,
we
could
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty.
you
did
not
say
that
that
was
a
misleading
instruction,
did
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
a
misleading
instruction,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
the
court
of
appeals.
if
--
if
a
court
--
a
court
isn't
engaged
on
a
specific
question
of
charging
a
jury
in
abstract,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
did
the
government
say
that
there
was
evidence
to
satisfy
that
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
so
therefore,
they
--
they
tried
to
sustain
the
verdict
on
the
ground
that
there
was
evidence
to
sustain
that
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
comes
along
and
says,
there
wasn't
evidence
to
sustain
that
charge
and
therefore,
we
order
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
government
says,
well
you
have
no
business
to
dismiss
the
indictment
because
of
convict
--
she
can
be
--
we
have
another
chance
--
since
you
threw
out
that
ground,
we
have
another
chance,
i'm
not
saying
that's
right
or
wrong,
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is,
we
have
another
chance
by
which
you
established
that
the
statute
has
not
run.
that's
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
no
theory,
the
government
--
the
only
theory
the
government
had
when
it
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
record,
the
evidence
before
the
jury
validated
or
justified,
was
verdict
of
the
jury,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
disappointed
in
the
view
the
court
took.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
said,
don't
throw
us
out
permanently
because
on
the
--
on
the
allegations
of
the
indictment,
we
can
establish
the
allegations
if
you
give
us
a
chance,
that's
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
courts
don't
--
they
adjudicated
the
theory
they
adjudicate
rights
and
wrongs,
convictions,
judgments,
they
don't
adjudicate
theory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
accept
that
principle.
the
principle
that
i
understand
is
that
if
there's
a
conviction
and
the
convicted
person
appeals,
he
opens
up
the
whole
proceeding.
and
what
should
be
done
on
appeal
is
for
the
appellate
court
to
determine
whether
it
should
send
the
case
back
or
should
say
no,
this
is
so
frivolous
and
so
wrong
that
we
direct
the
district
court
to
dismiss
it.
that's
what
i
understand
that
(inaudible)
to
these
appeals
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'd
suppose
that's
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
which
you
could
get
around
the
double
jeopardy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
provision
to
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
some
other
considerations
come
in
to
play,
mr.
bischoff,
namely,
considerations
of
fair
judicial
administration
and
this
court
in
its
review
of
the
courts
of
appeals
may
decide
in
its
general
supervisory
power
that
it
isn't
right
that
this
person
should
be
subjected
to
another
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
but
the
other
--
but
the
basic
responsibilities
that
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
what
it
should
do
when
a
person
has
been
convicted,
seeks
to
review
that
conviction
and
rips
open
the
whole
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
theory
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
court's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
decision
as
i
understand
it
for
100
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
it
is
tried
in
more
than
one
setting
and
the
whole
question
whether
he
is
--
he
is
being
tried
more
than
once.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
the
court
of
appeals
taken
to
account
that
if
--
if
there's
a
conviction
and
the
claim
is
made
that
he
should've
directed
a
verdict
of
acquittal
and
that
motion
is
denied.
and
the
case
goes
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
brings
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
there
is
an
appeal
and
the
court
deals
by
right,
there
wasn't
evidence
to
sustain
the
verdict.
is
it
a
constitutional
requirement
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
deny
the
rights
of
the
government
and
say,
“we
thought
we
have
plenty
of
evidence,
but
we
do
not
say
there's
a
gap.
we
control
that
gap
in
the
new
trail.”
do
you
think
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
convince
me
of
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i'll
have
to
order
the
great
deal
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
time
which
might
have
been?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
does
that
mean,
it
could've
been
or
it
might
be
considered
to
have
been
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
ask
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
--
that's
an
oath
of
dubiety,
but
its
effect
was
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
give
power
or
doubt
on
its
part.
