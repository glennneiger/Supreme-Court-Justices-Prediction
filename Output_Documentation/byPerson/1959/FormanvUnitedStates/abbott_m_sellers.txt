mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
settle
once
and
for
all,
the
chronology
here
of
this
case
and
to
demonstrate,
without
any
doubt,
that
from
the
very
beginning,
from
the
indictment
all
the
way
through
the
case,
the
government
took
the
position
in
line
with
the
so-called
alternative
theory
upheld
by
this
court
in
grunewald,
namely,
a
continuing
conspiracy
on
what
this
court
called
in
adopting
the
second
circuit
that
is
a
dissent
in
the
second
circuit's
characterization,
namely,
the
installment
theory
of
conspiracy.
the
government
did
not
submit
this
case
that
is
the
indictment
was
not
drawn.
the
case
was
not
argued
to
the
jury.
the
evidence
was
not
so
framed
on
the
subsidiary
conspiracy
theory
that
this
court
struck
down
in
--
in
grunewald.
now,
to
pursue
that
further,
the
indictment
charged
these
two
individuals
with
conspiring
first
to
the
attempt
to
evade
the
taxes
of
one
of
the
conspirators.
second,
it
charged
a
violation
of
the
evasion
statute
145
(b)
and
the
false
statement
statute,
by
means
of
making
false
statements
in
order
to
cover
up
the
income
of
seijas,
one
of
the
conspirators.
it
then
alleged
33
overt
acts
pursuant
to
the
conspiracy,
seven
of
which
occurred
within
six
years
of
the
returning
of
the
indictment.
so
that's
the
first
point.
the
indictment
did
not
depend
upon
a
subsidiary
conspiracy
theory.
now
the
evidence;
just
briefly
to
review
the
overt
acts
that
were
established
here
within
the
six-year
period
before
indictment.
the
government
--
that
is
the
indictment
alleges
four
acts
24,
26,
29
and
30,
which
consists
in
a
revenue
agent
visiting
both
of
these
conspirators
who
had
a
joint
office
and
who
ran
these
pinball
machine
out
of
partnerships
and
that
agent
during
the
period
1948,
made
numerous
visits
to
that
office,
talked
to
both
conspirators,
discussed
various
phases
of
the
--
the
taxes
and
the
taxes
or
rather,
and
the
income
of
the
four
pinball
partnerships
operated
by
the
--
this
business
and
submitted
two
reports
which
resulted
in
minor
deficiencies.
in
the
course
of
that
investigation,
they
were
--
the
agent
asked
for
and
was
given
books
which
were
false
that
namely,
they
did
not
disclose
the
true
income
of
the
four
pinball
partnerships
and
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
in
that
respect.
again,
in
1931,
i
mean
in
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
overt
act
31,
in
1951,
at
the
request
of
the
agent's
seijas
had
prepared
and
that
was
given
to
seijas
and
he
in
time,
turned
it
over
to
the
revenue
agents,
a
net
worth
statement,
which
showed
no
additional
income
for
the
period,
1942
through
1945.
that
is
no
unreported
income,
whereas
in
truth
and
in
fact,
the
evidence
later
established
that
there
was
at
least
$86,000
that
was
not
included
in
those
books,
neither
was
it
included
in
the
returns
of
seijas,
that's
overt
act
31.
overt
act
32
and
33,
maybe
looked
together,
consisting
of
statements
made
by
seijas
in
the
year
1952,
january,
the
lower
year
before
this
indictment
was
returned.
those
statements,
one
of
them
in
effect,
was
that
seijas
believed
that
he
had
reported
all
of
his
income
from
the
year
of
19
--
the
year
of
1942
through
1945.
the
other
statement
was
that
in
relation
to
$165,000
shown
on
this
net
worth
statement,
that
he,
seijas,
had
no
knowledge
where
that
money
came
from,
but
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
in
the
early
1953,
which
as
we
say,
was
the
time
when
this
conspiracy
was
abandoned.
seijas
came
to
the
agents
and
said
that
$165,000
belongs
in
1942
through
1945.
so,
the
evidence
was
not
submitted
on
the
theory
of
a
--
of
a
subsidiary
conspiracy
namely
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
a
conspiracy.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
yes,
all
of
these
acts
that
i've
just
described
24,
26,
29,
30,
31,
32
and
33
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
were
all
within
six
years
of
the
indictment.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
19
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i'd
answer
that
in
--
in
this
way,
sir.
the
indictment
charges
evasion
of
seijas'
these
taxes
for
1942
through
1945.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
the
return
for
the
last
year
charged
in
the
indictment,
namely,
1945
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
would
be
due
march
15,
1946.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
so
all
that
putting
that
in
the
chronology
of
these
overt
acts,
overt
acts
24,
26,
29
and
30,
which
occurred
in
1948,
would
be
within
the
six
years.
overt
act
31,
which
has
occurred
on
december
1951,
namely,
the
net
worth
statement
submission,
would
be
within
the
six
years.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
and
for
that
matter,
32
and
33
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
because
they
occurred
in
january
1952.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
now,
in
the
opening
statement,
i'm
--
i'm
proceeding
still
along
the
line
to
demonstrate
to
your
honors,
that
the
government
throughout,
did
not
rely
on
the
so-called
subsidiary
conspiracy
theory.
the
case
was
tried
throughout
on
the
theory
that
this
was
a
conspiracy
to
attempt
to
evade
taxes,
not
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
a
conspiracy.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
no,
sir,
for
the
reason
that
the
court
gave
a
sufficient
instruction
covering
the
continuous
conspiracy
theory
and
that
is
pointed
out,
sir,
in
the
government's
brief,
page
4,
footnote
3.
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
--
that
that
charge
is
consistent.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
that's
at
page
4
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
court,
footnote
3.
it
has
several
quotations
from
the
instructions.
notably,
on
page
5,
the
bottom
of
the
page,
where
it
says
“third
--
in
other
words,
these
are
the
elements
that
the
court
said
that
the
jury
must
find,
third
that
one
or
more
of
the
alleged
conspirators
committed
an
overt
act
or
acts
within
a
period
of
six
years
form
the
filing
of
the
indictment
here
in
further
answer
the
conspiracy
and
during
its
continuous
purpose
of
the
object
of
the
conspiracy,
just
refer
it
too
the
namely,
attempted
evasion.
it
does
not
say
conspiracy
to
conceal
or
conspiracies.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
the
court
of
appeals
missed
the
whole
point,
sir
and
it
recognized
it
in
its
opinion
written
on
the
government's
request
for
rehearing.
that
it
overlooked
that
and
said
in
effect
that
the
--
the
case
might
--
as
it
said,
might
well
have
been
tried
on
that
theory.
we
submit
the
case
was
tried
on
that
theory
this
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
sir
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
the
court
of
appeals,
the
farther
it
went
was
to
say
it
might
have
been
tried.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
they
were
said
in
so
many
words.
it
said
the
evidence
tended
to
show
that
there
were
these
acts
which
would
be
consistent
with
that
theory
and
then
it
said,
it
might
have
been
tried.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
that's
the
language,
sir.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
would
answer
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
saying
that
--
that
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
convinced
that
it
had
been
tried
on
that
theory,
but
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
but
i
find
conviction
is
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well,
there's
not
doubt
on
our
part,
sir,
but
i
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
in
--
in
its
original
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
on
it's
original
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
it
presented
the
correct
theory
along
with
the
other
theories.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
on
the
petition
for
rehearing,
we
sought
to
point
out
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
case
had
been
properly
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
to
the
end
of
asking
for
a
new
trial
and
the
attitude
of
the
court
--
i
mean,
of
the
government
there
was,
that
admittedly,
there
had
been
some
confusion
brought
about
by
the
chronology
of
these
circumstances
that
i
will
now
relate.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
the
second
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well,
as
i
have
stated,
the
government
recognized
that
there
had
been
some
confusion
in
the
--
in
presenting
the
case
to
the
ninth
circuit,
because
of
the
--
the
grunewald
decision.
and
also,
of
course,
the
fact
that
there
had
been
instructions
submitted
to
the
jury
in
the
original
trial
which
as
we
pointed
out,
presented
the
government's
theory
and
also
an
instruction
at
the
request
of
this
petitioner
which
submitted
the
erroneous
grunewald
theories
of
subsidiary
conspiracy.
now,
the
government
recognized
that
it
must
share
part
of
the
blame
in
connection
with
the
submission
of
that
erroneous
instruction.
it
should
have
objected.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well,
i
think
that
the
government
owes
it
to
any
court
to
advise
it
what
its
--
its
view
of
the
law
is
in
connection
with
the
submission
of
instructions.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well,
that's
a
little
hard
to
understand,
sir,
but
nevertheless,
its
fair
to
say
that
the
--
the
government
thought
that
it
should
share
part
of
the
blame
for
he
confusion
that
resulted
in
the
--
its
failure
to
point
out
to
the
trial
court
that
it
was
an
error
in
giving
this
instruction.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
that's
exactly
right,
sir.
and
in
that
respect,
it's
not
distinguishable
from
the
grunewald
case,
itself.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
may
i
correct
a
statement
i
made?
the
chronology
--
chronology
of
the
situation
was
this
with
respect
to
the
grunewald
case.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
handed
down
its
decision
april
1956.
and
that
decision
recognized
in
affect,
two
theories,
the
so-called
subsidiary
conspiracy
theory,
although
judge
frank
dissented.
and
also,
the
continuing
conspiracy
theory,
the
trial
followed
that
by
a
few
weeks,
so
that
at
the
time
the
instructions
were
given
to
the
jury
on
the
authority
of
the
second
circuit's
opinion,
it
--
it
appeared
that
there
was
no
error
in
the
--
in
the
instruction
with
respect
to
subsidiary
conspiracy,
because
this
court
had
not
spoken
and
the
second
circuit
had
endorsed
it.
then,
the
trial
ended
on
august
9th
--
august
15,
1956
and
the
following
may,
nine
months
later,
this
court
handed
down
the
grunewald
decision
and,
of
course,
struck
down
the
implied
subsidiary
conspiracy
theory.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
no,
sir.
that
--
that
request
had
been
given
by
the
petitioner,
at
the
request
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
oh,
in
grunewald
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
if
i
understand
your
question,
sir,
it
was
why
we
had
not
pointed
out
that
the
petitioner
had
requested
this
instruction?
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well
i
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well,
i
think
it
reversed
the
case
--
you
mean
on
the
first
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
occasion?
because
the
--
there
were
some
confusion
in
the
manner
in
which
the
case
was
presented
to
it.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
yes,
sir.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
essentially
all.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
grunewald
was
may
27th,
1957.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
first
decision,
namely,
remanding
the
case
for
judgment
of
acquittal
was
september
15,
1958.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
and
then
within
the
30-day
period,
the
--
the
government
requested
a
rehearing
and
on
october
the
27th,
at
six
weeks
later,
the
court
of
appeals
handed
down
its
decision
with
respect
to
the
petition
for
rehearing,
modifying
its
original
opinion
and
instead
remanding
it
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
think
its
fair
to
say,
your
honor,
that
in
the
first
place,
we
clearly
submitted
the
case
on
the
basis
of
continuing
conspiracy,
that
is
the
theory
that
we
had
tried
the
case
on.
there
--
there
had
been
some
language
in
our
brief
in
the
--
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
did
not
clearly
distinguish
between
the
doctrine
of
continuing
conspiracy
as
opposed
to
a
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
conceal
a
conspiracy.
but
at
least,
at
one
--
in
one
point
of
the
argument,
one
of
the
points
of
the
arguments
was
that
an
adequate
instruction
had
been
given
and
the
case
had
been
tried
on
the
continuing
conspiracy
issue.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
yes,
sir.
we
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
that's
decided.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
no,
sir.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
yes,
sir.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
you
want
--
you
want
all
of
the
briefs
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
in
the
parties'
file,
in
connection
with
all
three
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decisions
(inaudible)
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
you
want
the
pleadings
--
the
pleadings
also,
yes,
sir.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
the
government's
position
in
that
event
is
that
the
charge
was
improper
and
that
there
should
be
a
new
trial.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
the
charge
was
presented
at
both
ways.
you
see
the
court
on
its
own
motion
had
submitted
it
properly,
that
as
it
now
turns
out
to
be
properly.
that
is
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
on
the
theory
on
which
the
government
had
tried
the
case,
a
--
a
continuing
conspiracy
to
accomplish
the
initial
objective,
namely,
to
evade
taxes.
now,
the
petitioner
came
in
and
requested
the
court
to
put
in
another
instruction
on
the
other
theory
that
was
involved
in
the
grunewald
case,
the
theory
that
this
court
ultimately
struck
down
in
grunewald
case.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
we
have
never
relied
on
that
theory,
your
honor,
never,
from
the
very
time
the
indictment
was
drawn
until
this
point.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
continuing
conspiracy
and
i
was
in
the
middle
of
one
point
of
pointing
out
that
the
government's
opening
statement
to
the
jury,
closing
statement,
as
well
as
the
instructions
which
we
have
discussed,
preceded
on
the
continuing
conspiracy
theory.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
think
the
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals'
second
decision
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
know,
sir.
oh,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
the
second
one,
i
think,
leaves
no
doubt
but
that
the
--
the
government
had
pointed
out
that
--
that
the
--
the
alternative
theory
that
is
the
continuing
conspiracy
theory
which
this
court
held
to
be
unexceptionable
in
grunewald,
was
also
before
the
court,
before
the
trial
court.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
yes,
sir.
the
government
says
--
this
is
on
record
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
1937
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
the
government
concedes
that
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
an
impermissible
theory,
but
says
that
as
in
the
grunewald
case,
the
indictment
here
presented
an
alternative
theory.
so
on
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well,
i
think
it's
inherent
in
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
they
say
that
the
case
might've
been
tried
on
this
alternative
theory
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
don't
read
that
in
the
same
way
your
honor
does
so
that
to
rule
out
that
the
other
one
was
not
in
the
indictment,
i
mean
in
the
charge.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
well
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
they're
contained,
sir,
on
page
--
on
our
--
in
our
brief,
pages
4
and
5,
in
footnote
3.
particularly
as
i
pointed
out
a
while
ago
on
bottom
of
page
5,
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
that
is
in
the
footnote
says,
“third
and
goes
on
to
point
out
that
the
jury
must
find
that
one
--
one
or
more
the
conspirators
committed
an
act,
an
overt
act
or
action
within
a
period
of
six
years
prior
to
the
following
indictment
herein,
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
and
during
its
continuance
to
accomplish
the
object,
namely,
attempted
evasion
of
the
tax
liability
of
seijas.”
now,
that
clearly
is
charging
a
continuing
conspiracy
to
accomplish
the
original
objective
of
the
conspiracy,
not
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
a
conspiracy.
i
should
also
like
to
say
a
few
words
on
the
point
that
we
emphatically
disagree
with
the
petitioner's
statement
that
the
court
of
appeals,
when
it
granted
the
petitioner's
original
request
and
remanded
the
case
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
that
the
court
of
appeals
based
that
decision
on
the
evidence.
your
honors
please,
on
page
1934
and
1935
of
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals
after
a
lengthy
discussion
of
the
two
theories
in
grunewald
and
pointing
out
that
--
that
the
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
conceal
a
conspiracy
is
invalid,
ends
up
by
saying,
“upon
the
authority
of
this
decision,
namely,
grunewald
of
the
supreme
court,
we
hold
that
it
was
error
to
permit
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury.”
furthermore
on
its
--
in
its
--
among
other
places,
in
its
third
opinion
on
record
1940,
the
court
emphatically
says,
“denies
that
it
had
taken
that
initial
action
on
the
basis
of
insufficiency
of
evidence.”
it
pointed
out
that
it
took
that
action
because
it
didn't
understand
originally
that
the
government
was
relying
on
the
continuing
conspiracy
theory.
it's
the
government's
position
that
--
that
--
but
for
this
single
item,
namely,
the
instruction
to
the
jury
on
the
theory
that
there
was
a
--
there
had
to
be
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
a
conspiracy,
had
that
instruction
not
have
been
injected
into
the
record
by
this
petitioner,
that
this
case
would
come
to
this
court
with
a
flawless
record
that
would
support
the
conviction
and
we
see
no
distinction
otherwise,
between
this
case
and
grunewald.
and
there's
no
reason,
it's
apparent
that
this
petitioner
should
be
given
any
different
treatment
than
was
given
to
grunewald,
because
there
was
a
--
it's
the
same
confusion
as
to
--
that
may
have
been
created
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
as
to
which
theory
was
the
proper
one.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
where
are
you
reading
from?
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
see.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
and
your
question
is
whether
that
is
a
correct
instruction
to
support
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
no,
sir.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
when
a
fix
of
concealment
there,
he's
--
he's
not
requiring
to
concealment
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
that
is
--
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
theory
of
a
continuing
conspiracy,
sir.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
the
court
has
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
think
the
--
well,
i
think
all
it
is
--
is
necessary
to
bring
to
focus
the
essential
differences
between
the
--
the
good
instruction
and
the
bad,
is
to
read
entirely
footnote
3,
beginning
on
page
4
and
continuing
on
page
5
which
is
the
good
instruction.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
and
the
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
--
the
bad
one
is
in
the
body
of
the
brief,
beginning
on
page
5.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
in
other
words,
when
you
speak
of
concealment,
you
have
to
differentiate
concealment
of
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
and
a
concealment
of
true
income
in
order
to
effectuate
an
evasion
of
taxes.
so,
the
use
of
the
word
concealment
appears
in
both
the
good
and
the
bad
instruction.
i
think
if
your
honors
please,
if
you
have
no
questions,
that
would
conclude
the
government's
argument.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
thank
you.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
but
i
didn't
get
your
statement.
mr.
abbott
m.
sellers
my
answer
to
that
question,
sir,
is
that
is
an
inadvertence.
the
government
should
have
said
--
should
have
said
solely
in
accordance
with
the
theory
outlined
above.
