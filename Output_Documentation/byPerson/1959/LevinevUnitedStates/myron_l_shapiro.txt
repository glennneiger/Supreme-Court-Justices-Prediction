mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
certiorari
to
review
the
petitioner's
conviction
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
for
criminal
contempt
in
refusing
to
answer
certain
questions
before
a
district
judge
in
a
grand
jury.
this
is
a
companion
case
emanuel
brown
versus
the
united
states
decided
by
this
court
at
its
last
term
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
brown
and
mr.
levine
are
business
partners.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
one
which
was
not
considered
in
the
brown
case
and
that
is
the
effect
of
the
secrecy
of
the
proceedings
in
which
levine
was
found
guilty
and
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
by
the
district
judge.
the
issue
is
whether
in
such
a
proceeding
has
approved
by
this
court
in
brown
versus
united
states
held
in
secret,
the
district
judge
can
summarily,
without
trial
or
hearing,
convict
the
man
--
convict
the
grand
jury
witness
of
criminal
contempt.
as
in
brown,
the
petitioner
here
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
in
fact,
the
one
factual
difference,
mr.
justice
douglas,
is
the
fact
that
the
record
in
this
case
unlike
brown
is
clear
that
on
the
second
time
when
the
petitioner
was
brought
down
to
the
district
courtroom
before
the
district
judge
by
the
assistant
of
united
states
attorney
with
the
grand
jury
there,
the
courtroom
was
cleared
at
the
direction
of
the
court
and
remained
cleared
throughout
the
proceeding
until
the
petitioner
was
admitted
to
bail
after
sentence.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
was
limited
to
--
to
these
two
questions
which
are
--
which
appear
in
my
--
in
my
brief
at
page
2,
the
two
questions
presented
and
on
which
certiorari
was
allowed.
as
in
brown,
the
petitioner
appeared
before
the
april
1957,
regular
grand
jury
in
the
southern
district
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
which
stated
that
it
was
investigation
under
the
motor
carrier
act.
his
counsel
was
present
while
he
was
in
the
grand
jury
room.
he
refused
to
answer
the
same
six
questions
as
brown
on
the
ground
of
possible
self-incrimination.
brown
had
already
been
convicted.
the
petitioner
was
brought
down
before
the
district
judge
levet
in
room
318
of
criminal
part
of
the
southern
district
court.
and
there,
the
hearing
was
had
on
his
obligation
to
answer
the
questions
whether
the
immunity
statute
applied
or
not.
and
the
district
judge
directed
the
petitioner
to
answer
the
six
questions.
this
was
on
a
friday.
he
was
directed
to
--
directed
to
appear
on
monday
at
11:30
before
the
grand
jury
and
to
answer
the
questions.
he
appeared
on
the
monday
at
11:30
with
his
counsel,
counsel
was
in
the
anteroom
while
he
was
before
the
grand
jury.
and
their
petitioner
refused
to
answer
the
questions
on
the
ground
of
possible
self-incrimination.
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
were
then
directed
to
proceed
to
the
courtroom
of
district
judge
levet.
when
counsel
--
when
petitioner
and
counsel
arrived
there
along
with
the
grand
jury
and
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
the
district
judge
directed
that
the
courtroom
be
cleared
which
was
done
and
the
record
notes
that.
on
page
30
of
the
record,
it
is
clear
and
the
government
does
not,
in
this
case,
disagree
with
the
statement
that
the
courtroom
was
cleared
and
that
it
continued
cleared
throughout
the
entire
proceeding.
proceedings
then
occurred
as
they
did
in
the
brown
case
with
petitioner's
counsel
requesting
that
notice
and
specification
of
charges
and
hearing
in
accordance
with
due
process
and
rule
42
(b)
be
have.
this
was
denied.
i
will
not
refer
to
other
matters
that
were
raised
as
they
are
not
within
the
petition
--
within
the
grant
of
certiorari
here.
then
the
grand
jury
stenographer
was
put
on
the
stand
and
testified
as
to
what
had
happened
in
the
grand
jury
room,
that
is
the
refusal
of
the
petitioner
to
answer
the
six
questions.
the
district
judge,
over
the
objection
of
counsel,
directed
that
--
then
directed
that
the
petitioner
take
the
stand.
request
was
made
that
the
proceeding
be
had
in
accordance
with
rule
42
(b)
and
the
district
judge
overruled
that
request
and
stated
that
this
was
a
proceeding,
a
contempt
proceeding
pursuing
at
the
rule
42
(a),
thereby,
in
granting
among
--
in
--
in
our
opinion,
a
new
type
of
contempt
proceeding
on
the
rule.
the
petitioner
took
the
stand
and
the
district
judge
put
each
question,
refused
by
him
to
be
answered
to
him
over
objection
and
in
each
case,
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
possible
self-incrimination.
at
the
end
of
the
putting
of
these
questions,
he
was
also
asked
by
the
district
judge
at
the
request
of
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
as
to
whether
he
would
answer
the
questions
and
sent
back
to
the
grand
jury
room
which
he
stated,
he
would
not
do.
the
district
judge
then
directed
him
to
stand
down
and
stated
that
he
would
listen
to
any
reason
as
to
why
he
should
not
be
held
in
contempt.
at
this
point
again,
request
was
made
that
the
proceeding
be
in
accordance
with
due
process
and
with
rule
--
rule
42
(b)
that
there
be
a
notice,
specification
of
charges
and
a
hearing.
there
was
argument
as
to
whether
he
should
be
adjudicated
in
contempt,
what
the
sentence
should
be
and
the
petitioner
received
the
sentence
of
12
months.
he
was
adjudicated
in
contempt
and
received
the
sentence
of
12
months.
he
was
admitted
to
bail
and
is
still
on
bail.
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
secrecy
of
these
proceedings
from
the
time
at
least
that
he
was
put
on
the
stand
in
the
courtroom
to
the
time
of
the
adjudication
and
sentence
made
these
proceedings
bad
that
it
was
not
in
accordance
with
due
process
that
--
and
the
due
process
prohibits
in
a
secret
proceeding
such
as
this,
the
summary
adjudication
of
contempt
by
the
district
judge
without
notice,
without
hearing
and
without
charges.
in
this
connection,
the
prime
case
is
cooke
versus
united
states,
267
u.s.via
17.
in
that
case,
chief
justice
taft
said
that
due
process
in
criminal
contempt
requires
notice,
specification
of
charges
and
hearing
except
in
one
situation
only
and
that
is
where
some
contumacious
act
is
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court
in
the
actual
view
of
the
court
while
the
court
is
open
in
open
court.
otherwise,
unless
that
it
is
public,
unless
it
is
a
public
act
of
contumacious
conduct,
there
must
be
notice,
specification
of
charges
and
hearing.
the
point
that
mr.
chief
justice
taft
made
in
the
cooke
case
as
to
the
reason
why
this
exception,
to
the
requirements
of
due
process
is
permitted
to
--
in
cases
of
contumacious
conduct
in
open
court
is
--
that
it
is
necessary
to
vindicate
the
dignity
of
the
court,
prevent
demoralization
of
the
court's
authority
in
public.
but
where
has
here,
the
contempt
--
the
contempt
occurs
in
a
secret
proceeding
such
as
this,
then
there
can
be
no
demoralization
of
the
court's
authority.
there
can't
be
no
need
to
vindicate
the
court's
dignity.
the
normal
due
process
proceedings,
the
notice
hearing
and
specification
of
charges
will
serve
and
must
serve
because
that
is
what
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to.
now,
this
court
in
the
oliver
case
which
followed
a
number
of
years
later,
reinforced
and
reiterated
that
rule.
that
case
was,
as
your
honors
know,
a
state
court
case
that
arose
in
the
state
of
michigan.
it
involved
the
one-man
grand
jury.
in
that
case,
oliver
was
questioned
by
a
circuit
judge
acting
as
a
one-man
grand
jury.
he
made
answers
which
this
one-man
grand
jury
considered
false
and
untrue.
this
proceeding
have
been
going
on
in
secret
without
opening
the
courtroom,
without
opening
the
proceeding
to
the
public,
this
one-man
grand
jury
convicted
oliver
of
criminal
contempt
and
sentenced
him
to
the
penitentiary,
i
believe
for
60
days.
this
court
reversed
oliver's
conviction,
held
that
it
was
a
denial
of
due
process
in
that
case
for
the
man
to
be
held
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
where
the
proceeding
was
had
in
secret.
the
fact
that
the
oliver
case
arose
under
the
fourteenth
--
fourteenth
amendment
requirement
of
due
process
should
not
affect
this
case
because
it
arises
under
the
fifth
amendment.
because
then,
we
will
have
a
situation
where
a
state
court
defendant
in
a
criminal
contempt
case
would
have
less
rights,
less
protection
than
the
one
in
a
federal
criminal
--
criminal
contempt
case
where
--
especially
in
the
case
of
a
--
the
counsel
to
a
grand
jury
witness.
now,
the
contention
is
made
that
this
wasn't
entirely
secret
that
there
was
just
some
sort
of
secrecy.
the
--
this
position
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
petitioner's
counsel
was
present
in
the
courtroom
while
these
proceedings
were
had.
but
the
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
are
quite
clear
that
the
mere
presence
of
counsel
does
not
convert
a
secret
proceeding
into
a
public
proceeding.
a
public
proceeding
means
the
presence
of
the
public,
not
the
entire
public
or
some
opponents
of
this
idea
would
urge
in
order
to
reduce
it
to
an
absurdity
but
to
those
members
of
the
public
who
might
be
interested
enough
to
attend
and
hear
the
proceedings.
at
least
there
must
be
that
access
to
the
proceedings
which
would
enable
those
members
of
the
public
interested
who
would
come
in
here.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
access
to
the
public.
the
mere
fact
that
counsel
was
there
does
not
make
it
anymore
public.
he
is
not
a
representative
of
the
public.
he
is
merely
an
arm
of
the
witness,
of
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
whatever
burdens
the
defendant
in
this
type
of
case
would
--
may
bear
because
of
the
secrecy
of
proceeding.
counsel
bears
them
just
as
well
because
if
he
is
too
aggressive
or
too
militant,
he
may
face
some
kind
of
censure
or
--
or
trouble
with
the
judge
in
the
--
in
such
a
proceeding
because
there
is
no
public
there
to
observe
the
conduct
and
behavior
of
the
court.
it
may
also
be
contended
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
this
right
to
a
public
hearing
in
this
criminal
contempt
case.
the
fact
is
that
no
specific
objection
was
made
to
the
closing
of
the
courtroom
and
it
is
not
contended
that
specifically,
counsel
stated
that
he
objected
to
the
closing
of
the
courtroom
or
the
continued
secrecy
of
the
proceeding.
the
fact
is
also
nevertheless
true
that
a
number
of
times
during
these
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
the
counsel
for
petitioner
did
object
to
those
proceedings
as
not
consistent
with
due
process
and
not
in
accordance
with
rule
42
(b).
and
this,
it
is
--
i
respectfully
submit
is
sufficient
to
put
--
to
have
put
the
court
and
the
government
counsel
on
notice
of
what
the
situation
is.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
of
the
recess,
i
was
discussing
the
question
of
whether
there
was
any
waiver
by
the
petitioner
so
as
to
prevent
this
court
from
considering
the
question.
and
i
pointed
out
that
while
no
specific
objection
was
made
before
it
had
been
raised
time
and
time
again
during
the
proceedings
as
to
due
process
and
the
effect
of
rule
42
(b).
but
in
any
event,
petitioner's
position
is
that
this
is
a
constitutional
right
and
while
it
may
not
be
the
rule
in
this
court
that
this
right
cannot
be
waived.
nevertheless,
there
must
be
an
express
conscious
waiver
as
in
the
case
of
a
trial
by
jury.
this
court
held
in
the
cases
which
involved
the
question
of
waiver
of
trial
by
jury
that
it
must
be
an
express
conscious
waiver.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
promulgated
by
this
court,
there
is
a
requirement
of
an
express
conscious
waiver.
no
such
express
conscious
waiver
occurred
in
this
case.
request
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
do,
your
honor.
no,
i
do
not.
but
i
say
that
that
question
has
to
be
determined
by
how
the
proceeding
ends.
if
it
ends,
first
of
all,
with
the
questions
being
answered,
there's
--
that's
of
no
consequence.
but
ends
perhaps
with
the
man
being
given
a
coercive
sentence,
that
is
being
given
into
the
custody
of
the
marshall
until
he
answers
the
questions,
then
perhaps
it's
not
improper.
but
if
it
ends
in
a
conviction
for
criminal
contempt,
then
the
--
that
clearing
of
the
courtroom
becomes
improper.
now,
i
say
that
that's
not
--
also,
i
say
that
this
is
not
basically
an
important
question
because
the
only
propriety
which
can
be
ascribed
to
it
arises
out
of
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
proceedings.
but
in
this
case,
the
government
contends
that
he
--
petitioner
was
not
prejudiced
because
what
transpired
before
the
judge
in
putting
these
questions
was
immediately
recorded
and
immediately
transcribed
and
given
to
the
public
anyway.
so
that
the
question
of
propriety
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
as
far
as
i
can
see
because
for
a
further
reason,
that
is
that
this
was
a
--
a
proceeding
which
the
district
judge
described
as
one
under
42
(a),
to
determine
whether
this
man
was
going
to
be
held
in
criminal
contempt
or
not.
it
was
therefore
then
in
the
nature
of
a
criminal
proceeding
and
it
have
to
public.
in
that
aspect
of
it,
i
say
that
that
order
was
improper.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well
i
would
say
in
that
situation
that
that
would
be
error
too
because
that
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process
and
there
would
be
a
further
complication
which
we
don't
have
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
petitioner
would
not
then
have
had
counsel
because
certainly,
counsel
would
not
have
been
permitted
into
the
grand
jury
room.
and
i
say
that
the
fact
that
it's
held
in
the
grand
jury
room,
in
the
judges'
chambers
or
in
the
courtroom
makes
no
difference.
if
it
results
of
a
criminal
conviction
for
criminal
contempt,
then
the
proceedings
have
to
be
public.
it
is
only,
i
say,
where
the
contumacious
act
has
occurred
in
open
court
before
the
judge
and
in
the
view
of
the
judge
that
he
can
summarily
adjudicate
the
man
in
criminal
contempt,
otherwise,
he
must
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
usual
requirements
of
due
process.
now,
this
may
seem
to
impose
an
unnecessary
burden
while
you
take
the
view
of
the
case
as
the
government
does
that
there
is
no
issue
of
fact.
but
chief
justice
taft
in
the
cooke
case
points
out
that
there
are
always
issues
of
fact.
maybe
no
issue
of
intent
as
there
was
in
the
cooke
case.
that
issue
may
not
be
present
here
but
there
is
an
issue
of
mitigation,
an
issue
of
extenuation
and
other
issues
which
may
arise
in
the
nature
of
the
case.
and
in
that
situation,
there
certainly
should
be
a
hearing,
should
be
notice
and
a
specification
of
charges
because
that
is
what
due
process
requires.
now,
i
have
not
spent
any
time
on
the
question
of
the
sixth
amendment
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
once
you
arrive
at
the
answer
that
due
process
requires
a
trial
of
a
hearing,
then
the
sixth
amendment
applies
and
there
--
there
must
be
a
public
trial
because
the
constitution
to
some
extent,
maybe
not
to
the
extent
that
other
--
some
people
would
like
to
see
it.
the
constitution
must,
to
some
extent,
apply
to
criminal
contempt
proceedings.
at
some
point,
the
inhibitions
and
prohibitions
of
the
constitution
must
apply
to
a
situation
where
a
man
is
held
in
criminal
contempt.
he
has
no
right
to
trail
by
jury.
he
has
less
rights
than
the
ordinary
defendant
in
a
criminal
case.
and
i
say
that's
certainly
one
of
the
rights
that
he
must
have
under
due
process
and
under
the
sixth
amendment
is
the
right
to
a
public
trial.
now,
it
is
also
clear,
i
submit,
that
since
this
is
a
constitutional
right,
the
petitioner
did
not
have
to
show
--
does
not
have
to
show
prejudice
while
there
are
some
few
--
some
cases
which
hold
that
the
defendant
and
where
the
public
has
been
excluded
in
the
show
of
prejudice.
there
are
other
cases
and
more
authoritative
cases
which
hold
that
he
need
not
show
prejudice.
and
that's
especially
true
here
because
with
--
we
are
concerned
with
a
constitutional
right,
the
depravation
of
a
constitutional
right.
and
this
court
has
consistently,
in
the
main
held
that
where
a
constitutional
right,
such
as
the
right
to
a
public
trial
of
due
process
is
concerned,
there
need
be
no
showing
of
prejudice.
and
this
record
does
not
disclose
any
showing
of
prejudice
but
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
bar
to
reversing
this
conviction.
one
of
the
important
questions
in
this
case
is,
when
did
the
right
to
a
public
trial
or
public
hearing
or
to
the
admission
of
the
public
whether
you
want
to
call
at
a
trial
or
a
hearing
or
some
other
kind
of
proceeding.
when
did
that
right
accrue?
it
is
petitioner's
position
that
that
right
accrued
when
he
was
called
to
that
stand
in
the
courtroom
by
the
district
judge
and
the
questions
were
put
to
him.
this
was
as
the
district
judge
said,
a
contempt
proceeding
pursuant
to
rule
42
(a).
this
was
a
proceeding
to
determine
whether
he
was
in
contempt
of
court.
he
was
therefore
in
jeopardy.
he
was
in
jeopardy
of
his
liberty
at
that
point
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
is,
at
the
point
where
in
the
nature
of
proceeding
the
witness
or
the
defendant
is
put
in
jeopardy
that
it
becomes
a
trial
or
proceedings
which
must
be
public.
and
therefore,
we
say
that
the
right
to
a
public
trial
accrued
at
the
time
that
he
was
put
on
the
stand.
the
questions
that
we
have
raised
here
on
the
issue
of
public
--
of
a
hearing
in
this
type
of
case
are,
i
respectfully
submit,
very
important.
it
may
not
be
so
apparent
on
the
face
of
this
case
but
the
fact
is
that
endorsing
such
secret
proceedings
in
federal
criminal
investigatory
practices
can
lead
to
many
oppressive
occurrences.
for
example,
a
witness
could
be
served
early
in
the
morning,
what
they
forthwith,
the
subpoena
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury.
but
to
appear
before
that
grand
jury
and
refuse
to
answer
be
taken
down
before
the
judge,
directed
to
answer,
take
him
back
to
the
grand
jury,
refuse
to
answer
again
and
then
be
adjudicated
in
contempt,
convicted
of
a
crime
all
in
secret
and
possibly
be
in
the
penitentiary
or
prison
within
the
day.
this
sort
of
thing
can
lead
to
abuses
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
claim
and
clear
depravation
of
due
process
of
law
and
denial
of
the
rights
under
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
just
wanted
to
take
a
minute
or
two
of
this
court's
time,
if
your
honor
please.
on
the
terry
case,
mr.
chief
justice
taft
in
the
cooke
case
said
--
he
affirmed
terry.
it
was
there
held
that
a
court
of
the
united
states
upon
a
commission
of
a
contempt
in
open
court
might
act
summarily
without
trial.
the
important
distinction
between
the
terry
case
and
this
case
that
is
the
cooke
case
and
having
some
at
bar
is
that
this
contempt
was
not
in
open
court,
this
was
brought
out
in
--
in
the
sentence.
so
that
the
--
this
court's
understanding
to
now
on
the
terry
case
has
been
because
on
its
facts,
it
was
a
contempt
committed
in
open
court
that
it
dealt
with
contempts
committed
in
open
court.
i
also
wanted
to
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
sacher
case,
the
contempt
proceeding
there
343
u.s.
1.
in
that
case
mr.
justice
jackson
answering
an
argument
of
the
petitioner's
counsel
there
that
(inaudible)
could
have
taken
the
lawyers
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury
and
up
to
the
bench
and
convicted
him
there
for
contempt
each
time
they
overstep
the
line,
said
that
this
is
not
possible.
i'm
not
quoting
him
exactly,
he
said,
"in
the
oliver
case,
we
held
that
the
contempt
conviction
must
be
public
and
therefore,
it
cannot
be
done
in
that
way."
and
i
might
also
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
cooke
case
was
a
contempt
committed
in
chambers
because
the
letter
which
cast
as
versions
upon
the
district
judge
was
delivered
by
an
agent
of
the
attorney
who
was
held
to
be
in
contempt
to
the
judge
in
chambers
during
a
ten-minute
intermission
for
rest
and
refreshment
as
to
before
it
says.
and
the
chief
justice
taft
said
that
this
is
the
mistake
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
judge.
they
considered
this
a
contempt
committed
in
open
court,
it
was
not
committed
in
open
court,
and
therefore,
the
procedure
in
the
cooke
case
was
held
to
be
bad
and
i
respectfully
submitted
that
the
procedure
here
should
be
bad
on
the
ground
of
secrecy.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes
i
did,
unfortunately
i
don't
have
my
brief
here
but
i
did
raise
it.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no,
but
i
have
--
i
checked
my
bag
and
i
have
my
brief
i
believe,
i
could
submit
it
to
your
honors
but
--
but
i
did
raise
it.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
your
honor
noted
in
the
per
curiam,
did
not
make
any
reference
to
this
in
--
in
the
omnibus
or
catch-all
as
far
as
at
the
end,
it
said,
“he
raises
no
other
point
to
the
merit
on
this
appeal.”
and
i
suppose
in
their
opinion,
this
is
one
of
those
that
was
included.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes
it
was.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
don't
believe
that
i
mention
the
cooke
case
in
the
court.
i
relied
there
mainly
on
the
oliver
case
because
these
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
written
before
the
brown
case.
it
was
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
there
--
the
--
the
briefs
in
the
levine
case
were
written
sometime
ago
and
i
did
not
refer
to
the
cooke
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
i
did
refer
to
the
oliver
case
which
in
a
large
measure
is
based
on
the
cooke
case.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no,
i
did
not
sir.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no,
i
did
not.
i
thought
the
view
of
the
statement
at
the
bottom
and
i
--
did
not
serve
any
purpose
by
doing
so.
