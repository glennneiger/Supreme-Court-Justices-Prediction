mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
brown
case
of
last
term,
this
court
held
that
where
a
witness
has
been
directed
by
a
judge
to
answer
a
question
or
group
of
questions
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
witness
refuses
before
the
grand
jury,
to
obey
the
judge's
order,
the
judge
while
he
may,
in
his
discretion,
institute
a
proceeding
by
notice
and
hearing
under
rule
42
(b)
in
which
hearing,
since
the
contempt
did
not
occur.
in
present
of
the
judge,
there
would
have
to
be
adduced
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
witness
refused
to
obey
the
judge's
instruction.
but
that
on
the
other
hand,
the
judge
in
his
discretion
could
give
the
witness
another
chance.
in
effect,
perhaps
waive
the
completed
contempt
before
the
grand
jury
and
give
the
witness
another
chance,
a
--
a
locus
poenitentiae,
i
think
it
was
the
--
this
court
put
it.
in
a
new
proceeding
in
the
presence
for
the
grand
jury
presided
over
by
the
judge
in
which
the
judge
personally
propounded
the
questions
to
the
witness.
and
then
if
the
witness
again
refused,
the
contempt
since
it
occurred
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
under
the
eye
of
the
judge,
could
be
summarily
punished
under
rule
42
(a).
now,
the
essence
of
a
summary
proceeding
under
rule
42
(a)
is
precisely
that
there
is
no
hearing,
there
is
no
trial
because
there's
nothing
to
try.
the
judge
thought
the
contempt
happened.
therefore,
i
think
that
it
is
apparent
that
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
the
sixth
amendment
toward
speedy
in
public
trial
which
is
granted
to
all
accused
just
have
no
applicability.
it's
not
an
exception,
it
just
has
no
applicability
to
a
proceeding
under
rule
42
(a).
now,
counsel
had
referred
to
the
oliver
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
oliver
case
has
very
little
--
very
little
in
common
with
this
case.
that
was
a
case
where
the
contempt
--
where
the
offense,
although
denominated
contempt,
actually
was
allegedly
perjurious
testimony
before
the
judge
grand
jury.
and
the
reason
why
the
judge
thought
that
the
testimony
was
false
was
that
another
witness
would
appear
before
the
judge,
had
given
a
different
version
of
the
events.
and
the
judge
without
any
trial,
without
according
the
witness
counsel
or
giving
him
any
of
the
incidents
of
a
trial,
adjudicated
him
in
contempt.
and
this
court
held
that
that
could
not
be
reconciled
with
due
process.
well,
in
this
case,
the
most
important
distinction
is
that
there
was
nothing
to
try.
as
i
said
before,
the
contempt
occurred
in
the
eye
--
under
the
eye
of
the
court.
i
think
that's
the
most
important
distinction.
another
distinction
is
that
here,
the
most
important
member
of
the
public,
the
petitioner's
counsel,
was
concededly
present
throughout
the
proceedings
vigorously
asserting
the
witness'
interest
every
step
of
the
way.
it
seems
to
me,
that
far
cry
from
the
situation
of
the
oliver
case,
entirely
apart
from
the
other
distinction
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago.
now,
the
question
might
arrive,
and
that
should
before
the
court.
how
about
the
adjudication
itself?
should
that
have
been
(inaudible).
now,
i'm
--
i'm
distinguishing
now
between
adjudication
of
contempt
and
a
trial.
as
i
point
out
a
moment
ago,
there
was
no
right
to
a
trial.
but
should
the
judge,
after
the
witness
had
disobeyed
the
judge's
order
to
answer
the
questions
right
in
the
presence
of
the
judge,
should
he
then
have
opened
the
doors
to
the
public?
the
--
the
session
at
that
time
was
properly
closed
in
the
public
since
it
was
an
essence
of
grand
jury
proceedings.
should
he
then
have
opened
the
doors
to
the
public?
possibly
so
but
i
think
that
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
judge
asked
counsel
for
the
--
for
the
witness
to
--
to
give
him
any
reason
why
he
should
not
pronounce
the
witness
then
and
there
in
contempt.
and
neither
the
witness
nor
his
counsel
nor
anyone
present
suggested
to
the
judge,
“your
honor,
remember
this
is
still
close
to
the
public.
before
you
adjudicate
this
man
in
contempt,
you
should
reopen
the
--
the
courtroom
to
the
public.”
if
that
had
been
done,
i'm
sure
--
i'm
sure
the
judge
would
have
had
no
hesitancy
in
doing
that,
but
it
was
not
done.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
objection
made
and
it
has
elementary
that
the
purpose
of
an
objection
is
to
avoid
a
situation
where
a
judge
is,
so
to
speak,
trapped
into
committing
error.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
just
--
is
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
no
sir.
no,
i
mean
--
not
entrapment
in
the
--
in
the
legal
sense
of
that
term
sir,
i
didn't
mean
that,
no.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
asking
the
witness
and
his
counsel
to
give
him
any
reason
why
he
should
not
then
and
there
pronounced
the
witness
in
contempt.
and
then
the
--
neither
the
witness
nor
his
counsel
object
to
the
fact
that
the
proceeding
is
still
closed
to
the
public.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
is
that
the
judge?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
(inaudible)
the
general
authority
that
if
there
is
anything
that
a
party
or
his
counsel
finds
objectionable
about
any
action
that
the
judge
takes
or
proposes
to
take
that
just
out
of
--
out
of
fairness,
it
should
be
called
to
the
judge's
attention.
so
that
he
can
correct
his
mistakes
or
his
imminent
mistake
if
it
would
be
a
mistake.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
--
oh,
it
is
--
it
is
clear
that
in
the
matter
of
plain
and
prejudicial
error
that
a
court,
an
--
an
appellate
court,
may
sua
sponte
of
its
own
volition
in
the
interest
of
justice,
correct
an
error
even
though
it
was
not
called
to
the
judge's
attention,
even
though
no
objection
was
taken.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
and
see
that.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
i
have
not,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
are
any
on
a
matter
of
a
true
public
trial
but
remember,
i
--
i
made
a
point
a
moment
ago,
sir,
that
there
was
no
right
to
a
trial
here.
the
only
question
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
i
think
that
if
there
was
a
right
to
a
trail,
then
even
though
the
counsel
failed
to
--
to
demand
one
or
to
object
to
the
failure
to
give
one,
i
would
concede
that
an
appellate
court
in
its
discretion
could
correct
that
error
even
though
the
object
was
not
made.
but
this
is
an
entirely
different
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
suggest
so,
there
was
no
right
to
a
trial
here.
but
solely,
the
only
question
i'm
addressing
myself
to
now
is
whether
or
not
possibly
he
may
have
been
entitled
to
have
the
adjudication
at
--
it
was
really
a
formality,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
a
conviction
of
criminal
contempt
under
rule
42
(a).
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
--
i
must
distinguish,
sir,
between
a
42
(a)
conviction
and
a
42
(b)
conviction.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
summary
--
summary
of
criminal
contempt.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
ex
parte
terry.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
says
in
a
--
in
a
summary
--
a
summary
contempt
proceeding,
there
is
no
right
to
a
trial.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it's
--
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
sir.
now
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
--
the
court
did
not
in
--
in
that
case
it
happened
that
the
contempt
was
committed
in
a
--
an
open
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
i
think
that
as
long
as
it's
committed
under
the
eye
of
the
court,
so
that
there
is
--
so
that
there
is
nothing
to
try,
then
it
should
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
a
properly
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
a
properly
a
secret
proceeding.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
a
--
a
proper
--
a
properly
secret
proceeding.
if
he
--
if
he
commits
contempt
in
a
properly
secret
proceedings,
i
would
agree
with
--
with
your
observation,
sir.
now,
in
this
case,
not
only
has
there
been
no
prejudice
but
the
point
was
untimely
raised.
i
think
there
was
--
there
was
a
--
even
--
even
if
there
was
prejudice,
there
was
a
further
point
that
this
was
not
raised
until
the
court
of
appeals.
and
so
for
all
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgement
appealed
from
is
correct.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
it
said
that
the
point
was
--
was
implicitly
decided
by
the
brown
case.
the
opinion,
it's
a
per
curiam
opinion
--
opinion,
sir
on
page
46
of
the
record.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
you
are
right,
sir.
i
think
that
it's
not
discussed.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
right.
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
the
brown
decision
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
implicitly
decided
this
point
too,
i'm
mean
--
i
mean
implicitly.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
yes.
but
i
mean
the
brown
decision
decided
everything
that
is
pertinent
to
a
disposition
of
this
point,
is
my
point.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
when,
judge
levet,
after
excusing
the
witness
from
the
witness
stand
and
when
he
said,
"i
will
listen
to
any
reason
why
i
should
not
pronounce
this
witness
in
contempt."
then
with
the
time
for
--
for
the
point
to
be
raised
that
the
adjudication
should
be
made
in
public,
if
ever.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
yes,
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
of
prejudice.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
think
the
--
possibly,
he
could
do
it
next
day.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
just
after
the
judge
to
resentence
him
publicly.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
i
think
that
--
i'm
quite
sure
that
it
--
a
district
court
has
the
power
to
vacate
its
own
order
of
a
cause
shown
and
to
--
and
to
re-adjudicate
a
resentence,
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
when
you
say
as
his
peril,
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
an
appellate
court
--
this
court
may
if
it
thinks
that
that
adjudication
should
have
been
made
publicly.
then
--
and
nothing
about
the
trail
now,
the
adjudication
could
sua
sponte
in
its
own
discretion
despite
the
failure
of
counsel
in
the
district
court
to
--
to
raise
the
point,
could
order
that
this
case
be
remanded
for
resentencing,
re-adjudication.
however,
i
don't
think
there's
any
necessity
for
it
because
there
has
been
no
showing
of
prejudice.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
say
that
was
a
case
of
plain
prejudicial
error,
sir.
and
--
and
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
summary,
a
properly
summarily
disposed
of
a
contempt
proceeding
were
there
is
no
trial.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
my
contention.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
you
--
you
say
--
you
say
tried
for
contempt.
that's
where
i
have
to
stop,
sir.
there
was
no
trial
here
and
there
should
not.
and
there
--
and
this
court
held
in
the
brown
case
that
there
properly
was
no
trial.
thank
you.
