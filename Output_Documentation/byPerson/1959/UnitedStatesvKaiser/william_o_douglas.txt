justice
william
o.
douglas
i
notice
the
instructions
to
the
jury
on
page
42,
are
there
any
parts
of
that
you
take
exception
to?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
any
exception
taken
at
the
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
other
instructions
asked?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
that
question
raised
at
the
trial
or
did
the
government
proceed
only
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
reason
that
i'm
asking
about
is
that
i
notice
it's
your
argument
that
--
that
you
are
making
points
that
the
judge
makes
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury
and
you're
apparently
appraising
for
(inaudible)
the
instruction
on
the
union
constitution.
he
asked
the
jury
to
consider
that
and
i
--
did
he
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
that's
the
construction
of
the
union
constitution,
but
the
fact
that
it
was
paid
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
pursuant
to
provisions
of
the
union
constitution
board
according
to
the
district
judge's
instructions
on
whether
or
not,
it
wasn't
delicately
handled.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
that
these
questions
are
questions
of
law
or
questions
of
--
for
a
jury?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
this
case
you
say
it
shouldn't
have
gone
to
the
jury
at
all.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
i
say
that
the
--
it
was
the
intention
of
the
union
to
pay
for
services.
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
these
payments
were
income.
how
can
you
resolve
that
question
without
submitting
it
to
the
jury?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
isn't
that
one
little
piece
of
income?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
that
this
judge
covers
that,
doesn't
he?
he
says
that
these
payments
were
made
by
the
union
because
of
any
obligations,
legal
or
moral,
would
make
such
payments
and
the
visions
of
its
constitution
or
under
its
organization
and
management
then
the
payments
were
not
gifts.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
part
of
what
you
thought.
