justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
claim
its
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
its
compensation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
it
comes
out
of
what
they've
earned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
the
union
member
or
the
company,
both
or
one
of
those?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
they've
been
--
they've
been
paid
for
their
employment,
haven't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
one
has
to
go
in
his
income,
an
income
tax
return.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
deducted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
the
other
part
they've
paid
i
presumed
had
an
income
--
had
they
paid
on
income
taxes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it
is
insurance,
you
couldn't
tax
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
we
had
a
case
on
that
years
ago,
didn't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that
was
for
injuries
from
some
railroads.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
followed
the
case
very
well.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
railroad
had
an
insurance
fund
a
long
time.
the
government
on
the
taxes
said
it
wasn't
insurance
for
that
purpose.
what
was
the
name
--
had
you
seen
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that's
the
standard
of
law
that
we
can
go
by?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
any
organization
that
gives
somebody
food,
as
i
understand
from
the
dissenting
judge
here,
this
was
solely
to
get
food,
shelter
or
clothing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
any
organization
that
gives
food,
shelter
and
clothing
that
the
standard
to
determine
whether
it's
a
gift
of
not,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
some
reason
besides
giving
them
the
food
and
shelter
and
clothing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
somebody
had
worked
for
you
a
long
time
and
you
would
have
--
some
years
later
give
him
something
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
be
income
still
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
remember.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
contract
to
give
this
man
funds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
what?
as
if
the
selling
judge
or
what
i'm
getting
at,
is
he
right
here
in
his
statement
of
what
this
money
was
given
to
the
judge,
the
judge
who
dissented
on
your
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
bring
you
about
the
record?
i
don't
know
if
it
would
make
any
difference
but
i
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
second
paragraph.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
don't
know
that
that
is
crucial
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
these
are
the
accepted
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
i'm
talking
about
it's
true
that
plaintiff
or
nonmember
was
given
strike
benefits
only
after
it
had
shown
himself
in
need
of
food,
clothing,
and
shelter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
fund
used
for
that
entirely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
conceded.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
it's
limited
to
strikers
and
therefore,
that's
the
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
members
of
the
racial
group?
had
they
had
an
organization
and
created
a
fund?
they
agreed
to
do
with
nobody
except
those
who
are
in
need
of
food,
shelter,
and
clothing.
would
they
come
under
your
definition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
so
that
racial
group.
they
created
a
fund
for
that
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
what
would
be
the
--
there
maybe
a
difference
--
and
crucial
and
that's
the
reason
i
asked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
congress
has
been
presented
with
this
problem
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
department
made
any
effort
to
get
them
take
it
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
this
effort
been
made
--
elected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
since
1920?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
has
been
collecting
these
funds
--
taxes
on
these
since
1920?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
have
any
statistics
here
that
you
can
give
us
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
can
get
to
that
just
one
question.
has
the
--
so
far
as
you
know,
as
it's
been
in
the
effort
to
get
congress
to
exempt
this
or
to
make
a
clear
statement
(inaudible)
of
anytime
in
any
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
legislation.
