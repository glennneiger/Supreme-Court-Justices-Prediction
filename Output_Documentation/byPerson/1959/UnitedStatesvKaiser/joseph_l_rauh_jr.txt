mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
might
profitably
be
elaborated
and
clarified.
in
1952,
respondent
went
to
work
at
kohler.
in
1953,
there
was
a
union
contract
at
kohler
for
the
first
time.
respondent
did
not
join
the
union.
on
march
4
--
1st,
1954,
this
contract
expired.
on
march
4,
four
days
later
the
workers
at
kohler
--
not
the
union,
the
workers
at
kohler
voted
to
strike.
the
international
union
held
them
back
and
here,
number
one
in
the
chain
of
reasoning
of
mr.
barnett
breaks
down.
the
international
union
of
payor
was
the
restraining
influence
here.
they
say
continuously,
international
union
urged
them
out
on
strike
and
then
gave
them
something
for
going
out.
that
isn't
what
happened.
the
workers
at
kohler
voted
the
strike,
the
record
is
clear,
the
international
held
them
back
as
long
as
they
could.
but
on
april
5th,
after
five
weeks
of
working
without
a
contract
there
was
no
longer
a
restrainable
situation
and
the
men
went
out
on
strike.
now,
remember
the
respondent
is
not
a
member
of
our
union.
he
did,
however,
go
down
to
the
headquarters
and
say,
“i'm
broke.
i
have
nothing.
i'm
in
need.”
that
was
all
that
was
asked
of
it.
are
you
want
--
they
never
asked
him
if
he
was
a
member.
they
said,
“are
you
on
strike
and
do
you
need
this?
how
much
do
you
need?”
well,
the
need
was
very
limited.
it
was
$16.5
of
--
not
cash,
but
a
regular
payment
to
the
place
where
he
lived
at
$9
a
week
and
a
$7.5
food
budget
that
he
could
take
to
a
store.
he
was
never
asked
if
he
picketed.
he
was
never
asked
if
he
would
promise
to
go
--
if
he
would
promise
to
not
to
stay
out
on
strike.
he
was
never
asked
that
he
was
a
member.
he
was
never
asked
if
he
can
contribute
any
service.
the
one
test
and
the
one
test
alone
was
need
and
on
march
4,
he
received
his
voucher,
his
two
vouchers,
one
to
pay
his
rent
and
one
to
pay
his
food
and
that
was
all
there
is
to
it.
there
was
no
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
up
to
your
honor,
as
to
determine
how
much
farther
in
the
record
they
would
go
in
an
instant
case.
i
am
only
here
to
present
these
particular
facts.
for
example,
i
stressed
the
fact
this
--
i
stressed
the
facts
because
for
example
mr.
barnett's
whole
argument
on
mutuality
is
out
the
window
because
our
man
--
never
our
client,
never
paid
a
dime
into
anything
at
any
time.
not
only
before
he
joined,
but
after
he
joined.
he
was
a
non-dues
paying
member
even
after
because
he
was
on
strike.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
precisely,
your
honor.
i
think
you
asked
the
question
in
which
i
would
going
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
someone
asked
mr.
justice
brennan
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
all
right.
i'm
perfect
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
and
i'm
perfectly
prepared
with
the
normal
case.
i
think
this
case
itself
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
if
you
would
have
asked
me
how
i
got
here,
i
don't
explain
that
i'm
not
sure
on
that
ground.
in
this
instance,
i'm
not
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
instance.
now,
the
respondent
didn't
treat
this
$16.50
as
income
and
of
course
it
was
the
collector
came
after
it
and
this
was
the
case.
now
in
the
reply
brief,
the
government
makes
much
of
the
charge
that
there's
something
wrong
with
the
charge
on
page
42
and
43
but
a
clear
reading
of
the
charge
will
only
indicate
that
the
only
thing
that's
wrong
with
it
is
repetition.
in
other
words,
if
a
repetitious
charge
is
necessarily
bad,
this
is
it.
but
this
is
a
perfectly
consistent
sound
charge
in
which
the
judges
say
it
works
out
of
feelings
of
kindliness
and
charity
not
tax,
it's
not
taxable.
if
it's
because
of
either
a
legal
or
moral
obligation
or
free
services,
it's
taxable.
you
said
it
four
or
five
times,
but
that's
what
he
said.
and
i
suggest
that
the
charge
of
anything
is
more
favorable
to
the
government
than
the
real
rule
of
law
because
the
real
rule
wouldn't
include
the
moral
obligation
as
a
ground
for
taxability
and
yet
the
judge
gave
them
this
and
it
seems
to
me
the
charge
is
more
than
fair
claim.
mr.
barnett
was
not
correct
when
he
suggested
that
the
judge
only
put
this
to
the
jury
because
--
having
made
up
his
mind.
he
actually
added
judgment
on
the
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
and
it
was
only
three
months
later,
he
changed
his
mind,
reversed
himself.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
court
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
hope,
too,
sir.
in
my
limited
time,
i
hope
to
argue
that
expressly.
i
only
want
to
say
before
coming
to
that
that
this
case
is
clear.
it's
clear
on
this
jury
finding
which
was
a
totally
correct
and
the
charge
was
correct.
if
anything
was
wrong
with
the
charge
as
i
say
because
it's
repetitious
and
secondly
that
is
too
favorable
to
the
government.
so,
that's
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
if
you
have
our
facts,
our
jury
--
jury
verdict
and
so
forth.
now,
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
about
that,
what
would
the
situation
be
if
this
man
were
a
member,
which
i
take
it
is
possibly
why
we
got
here.
if
this
man
had
been
a
member
and
if
all
these
other
considerations
are
that
mr.
barnett
referred
to
were
here,
we
say
that
the
doctrine
of
equal
treatment
would
require
the
affirmance
of
this
case.
in
other
words,
everything
in
the
whole
law
that's
like
strike
relief
is
not
taxed
and
i
say
everything
advisably.
social
security
payments,
that's
old
age,
unemployment
compensation
are
not
taxed
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
commissioner
and
the
government
has
played
ring
around
the
rosie
with
this
court
on
that
very
point.
the
commissioner
said,
strike
benefits
are
taxable
and
they're
different
from
social
security
because
congress
intended
social
security
payments
not
to
be
taxable.
then
the
government
came
to
this
court
and
said,
“oh,
we
didn't
mean
that.
that's
not
the
reason
that
social
security
is
different
from
strike
benefits.
the
reason
it's
different
is
because
social
security
is
charitable.
then
we
came
to
the
court
and
pointed
out
that
that
was
an
absolute
misreading
of
history
that
social
security
is
given
as
a
right
not
as
need
and
then
in
the
reply
brief
this
morning,
the
government
says,
“it's
different
because
social
security
is
public
not
private.”
in
other
words,
there
has
never
been
any
distinction
presented
to
this
court
between
social
security
payments
and
our
pay
--
and
the
payments
of
strike
benefits
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
anomaly
that
the
commissioner
and
the
government
are
in
here.
suppose
in
new
york
city
where
strike
--
where
unemployment
compensation
is
paid
to
a
striker,
it's
legal
in
new
york
to
pay
unemployment
compensation
to
strikers
and
in
connecticut,
it
is
not.
now
suppose
the
uaw
has
a
plant
in
new
york
and
a
plant
in
connecticut.
in
new
york,
under
the
government's
argument
here,
in
new
york,
we
get
unemployment
compensation
as
a
matter
of
right
based
on
the
previous
earnings
of
the
worker
and
it's
not
taxable,
according
to
the
government.
but
in
connecticut
where
it's
based
on
need
and
without
any
relationship
to
previous
earnings,
the
government
suggests
that
this
is
taxable.
i
just
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
anomaly
that
the
government's
whole
relationship
here
creates
is
what
its
fall.
now,
in
answer
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
may
be.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
there
has
been
no
suggestion
of
that
either
in
the
law
or
in
the
government's
brief
other
than
the
assertions
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
hadn't
suggested
that.
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
whether
welfare
payment
was
taxable
and
of
course
it
is
not,
but
it
isn't
just
public
welfare
payments
that
aren't
taxable.
on
page
25
or
our
brief,
we
point
out
all
sorts
of
payments
that
are
not
taxable.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
twenty
five
of
the
white
one,
mr.
chief
justice.
public
assistance
payments,
that
was
the
--
i
think
the
--
what
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to.
red
cross
aid
is
not
and
finally,
and
this,
it
just
seems
to
me
is
such
an
a
fortiori,
makes
out
an
a
fortiori
case,
an
employer
paid
relief
payments
to
his
employees,
an
employer
paid
them
to
his
employees
and
they
said
it
wasn't
taxable.
in
the
--
the
government
doesn't
attempt
to
distinguish
these.
if
there
is
not
a
single
case
in
the
law
cited
by
the
government
or
found
by
our
people
and
i
--
we
have
an
assistance
of
tax
counsel
and
assistance,
there
is
not
a
case
in
the
entire
law
where
subsistence
payments
for
needy
people
have
ever
been
taxed
by
the
commissioner
at
any
time.
this
is
the
first
time
in
history
where
the
commissioner
has
suggested
or
the
government
has
--
has
welded
this
together
here
because
he
disagrees
on
the
commissioner
on
all
the
reasoning
in
these
things
that
a
subsistence
payment
to
a
needy
person
by
anyone
would
be
taxable.
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
has
ever
been
suggested
anywhere
and
it's
being
suggested
here.
and
i'd
like
before
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
precisely
what
i
wanted
to
answer
at
this
point,
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
--
not
a
correct
--
i
don't
mean
to
disagree
with
that.
it
was
not
a
correct
statement
by
the
government.
on
page
36
of
our
brief,
in
our
footnote,
we
deal
with
this.
there
was
an
obscure
ruling
in
1920
of
one
sentence,
“never
enforce”
and
i
can
speak
quite
frankly
about
this
because
our
union
has
had
strikes.
we
have
had
this
problem.
this
ruling
was
never
enforced
as
you
will
see
from
this
footnote.
it
was
not
until
1950
--
remember
it's
not
a
regulation.
this
was
a
single
sentence
statement
in
1920.
it
was
not
a
regulation
as
the
question
by
the
chief
justice
would
have
--
have
indicated.
it
was
a
single
sentence,
never
paid
any
attention
to,
never
put
in
any
public
document
until
1957.
it
was
never
enforced
in
the
interim.
this
is
the
first
case
that
comes
up
under
it
and
indeed
it
was
this
case
and
the
uaw's
effort
to
get
the
--
to
get
the
matter
clarified
that
brought
the
thing
up.
for
the
whole
period
from
1920
to
1957,
nothing
happened
under
here.
this
was
the
--
this
was
not
even
a
regulation.
it
was
certainly
not
known
to
congress,
had
never
been
considered
by
congress
and
clearly
does
not
have
a
--
it's
so
much
less
of
a
reenactment
of
things
such
as
this
court
dealt
with
imbalanced
forms
of
and
other
cases
that
i
didn't
even
think
the
government
was
seriously
contending
under
the
reenactment
doctrine
and
i
really
don't
suppose
--
supposed
they
are.
if
they
are,
our
footnote
there
completely
answers
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
is
no
--
there's
not
one
word
in
the
record,
if
your
honor
please,
that
supports
that
statement
if
he
--
if
he
get
--
if
it
has
--
it
happened
at
this
particular
time.
we
had
never
been
--
there
had
never
been
payments
in
ours
and
there's
not
one
word
in
the
record
to
support
that
statement.
i
have
read
the
entire
record.
i'm
sure
mr.
barnett
would
be
of
any
help
on
that
point.
now,
there's
something
wrong
here.
when
for
the
first
time
in
history,
the
government
is
suggesting
this
payment
when
the
commissioner
is
taxable,
when
the
commissioner
is
taking
much
more
likely
subjects
of
payment
and
saying
they're
not
taxable
such
as
the
tornado
relief
from
the
employer.
the
commissioner
is
saying
it's
not
taxable
because
it's
need
and
now
the
government
is
coming
along
in
this
one
instance
alone
and
doing
--
well,
what
we
suggest
to
what's
wrong
is
obviously
this
is
an
income.
apart
from
the
gift
to
which
i'll
come
if
my
time
permits
me,
this
is
not
income.
the
only
possible
theory
on
which
this
could
be
income
is
the
argument
that
glenshaw
glass
makes
every
receipt
of
every
kind
no
matter
where
from
and
under
what
circumstances
of
income,
i
do
not
so
read
the
ruling
of
glenshaw
glass.
the
government
really
doesn't
argue
anything
except
that
glenshaw
glass
makes
everything.
now,
the
problem
here
on
glenshaw
glass
is
this.
the
government
--
department
of
justice
argument
is
not
with
me.
it's
not
with
my
client.
it
is
with
the
commission
because
on
page
31
of
our
brief,
we
list
about
20
cases
where
the
commissioner
has
excluded
things
from
income.
if
you
look
on
page
21
--
31
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
just
before
the
footnote,
rulings
rendered
before
glenshaw
glass
cut
unordered
and
adhered
to
by
the
commissioner
seems
have
to
say,
this
walls
of
rulings
rendered
after
glenshaw
glass
recognizes
nontaxable.
about
half
of
these
were
before
glenshaw
glass
and
about
half
of
these
were
after
glenshaw
glass.
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
commissioner
does
not
read
glenshaw
glass
as
the
government
would
have
this
court
read
it.
if
the
government
is
going
to
have
an
argument,
they
ought
to
settle
inside
the
administration
before
they
bring
it
to
the
taxpayers.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
some
would
be,
your
honor,
they
wouldn't.
you
have
the
panama
social
security
payment
which
was
decided
since
this
is
a
social
security
payment
by
the
governor
of
panama,
and
this
was
decided
to
be
a
payment
after
glenshaw
glass
is
non-taxable.
in
other
words,
glenshaw
glass
is
interpreted
one
way
as
leaving
all
the
--
leaving
exclusions
by
the
commissioner
and
now
another
way
by
the
government
here.
we're
caught
in
this
--
what
really
is
a
buzz
off
between
the
commissioner
and
the
department
of
justice.
now,
there
is
a
way
of
reconciling
these
cases
and
we
didn't
feel
we
had
any
obligation
to
do
it
because
the
government
relies
solely
on
glenshaw
glass
under
circumstances
it
seems
to
be
incorrect.
but
we
do
try
to
reconcile
the
cases
as
sort
of
the
--
that's
what
your
job
as
a
lawyer
is
to
see
if
you
can
take
all
these
things
and
make
a
principle
out
of
it,
we
try.
our
principle,
we
suggest
that
these
are
alleviative
things,
that
they
alleviate
some
critical
situation
that
they
take
care,
not
see
payments
to
people
who
were
persecuted
by
the
nazis.
well,
they
had
their
persecution
and
this
is
an
alleviation,
that's
one
actually
that
was
came
down
since
glenshaw
glass
and
we
suggest
that
the
whole
idea
of
an
alleviative
payment
may
be
the
difference
between
glenshaw
glass
which
was
a
windfall,
the
extra
amount
on
punitive
and
exemplary
damages
and
this
other
would
be
done
as
an
alleviative
payment.
now,
we
don't
have
the
burden
of
setting
up
a
new
rule
of
suggesting
how
you
reconcile
the
department
of
justice,
the
commissioner
and
the
decisions
of
the
court,
but
we
thought
we
would
try
it,
and
that
would
be
my
suggestion
as
to
the
simplest
reconciliation
of
all
the
different--
certainly
on
the
basis
of
the
commissioner's
rulings,
this
is
not
income.
certainly
on
the
basis
of
anything
we
know
that's
ever
been
decided
this
is
not
income.
now,
just
finally
in
the
short
time
available,
this
is
a
gift.
now,
i've
been
arguing
this
case
as
though
since
justice
frankfurter's
question
although
my
man
isn't
a
member
because
i
figured
that
the
--
it
seemed
rather
narrow
and
--
but
i
still
have
to
come
back,
i'll
have
to
remind
the
court
that
the
fact
that
i've
taken
new
facts
for
this
argument
that
the
fact
still
remains,
he
is
not
a
member
and
that
the
case
before
the
court
is
one
without
a
member.
but
let's
say
in
coming
back
now
and
assuming
he
were
a
member
and
the
jury
verdict
didn't
apply
for
the
equal
treatment
doctrine
that
i
have
been
wrong
despite
this
clarity
and
that
the
principles
of
income
applied
by
the
commissioner
should
be
disregarded
by
the
court
and
the
court
should
say
that
this
is
income
because
the
department
of
justice
asked
it
to
say
that
even
though
the
commissioner
takes
roughly
the
other
position,
even
if
we
are
wrong
in
all
of
that,
it
seems
unlikely.
it
seems
to
me
clearly
that
this
is
not
a
gift,
that
this
is
a
gift
and
not
taxable
as
a
gift.
now,
certainly
everybody
reads
there
was
no
service.
we
rendered
no
service.
he
didn't
have
to
picket,
they
didn't
know
this.
now,
what
the
government
really
is
saying,
they're
saying
that
he's
getting
compensated
for
the
act
of
striking.
well,
that's
really
in
any
knowledge
of
strikes,
that's
nonsense.
why
do
people
go
out
on
strike?
well,
they
go
out
for
their
--
for
basic
principles.
the
thought
that
a
man
who's
got
a
$100
job
is
going
out
on
a
strike
for
16.58,
a
seven
and
a
half
food
voucher
and
a
$9
room
rent
voucher,
he
didn't
go
out
on
a
strike,
because
of
this
he
went
out
on
a
strike
for
some
reason
that
was
in
his
heart
and
out
he
went.
now,
the
government's
argument
comes
down
to
the
fact
really.
if
you
are
in
a
class
and
you
get
something
in
a
class,
then
you're
getting
it
for
being
a
member
of
that
class.
you're
getting
it
for
the
act
of
joining
or
remaining
in
that
class
and
yet
the
government
concedes
that
there
was
no
request
that
these
days
on
strike.
many
who
received
the
assistance
went
back
in.
there
is
no
--
that
isn't
in
the
record
that
many
who
receive
assistance
went
back
in,
unless
you're
willing
to
say
that
anytime
you're
a
member
of
a
class,
then
you
are
getting
you're
payment
for
being
a
--
for
joining
or
be
--it's
like
if
you
give
a
gift
to
your
grandchild,
is
that
--
or
your
grandchildren,
is
that
really
a
payment
for
their
act
of
joining
or
remaining
your
grandchild?
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
until
i
heard
the
suggestion.
our
constitution
doesn't
give
an
enforceable
right
to
this.
mr.
barnett,
in
his
brief,
says
in
so
many
words,
there
is
no
enforceable
right
to
these
things.
he
says,
“oh
but
they
setup
a
policy
to
give
this.”
of
course
there's
a
policy.
the
policy
is
to
alleviate
hardship.
it's
done
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
there
is
--
if
your
honor
please,
there
is
not
a
single
suggestion
at
any
time
of
any
factual
support
for
that
argument.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
say,
sir,
that
there
are
mixed
motives
in
practically
everything
one
does
in
life.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
wouldn't
accept
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
probably
i
will
accept
something
else
if
i
could
compromise
a
little
bit
here
on
what
--
what
we
could
accept.
i
would
accept
the
proposition
that
there
are
mixed
motives
to
our
union,
to
the
strikers,
to
everyone
else
in
this
kind
of
an
operation.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
was
going
to
try
to
say
what
--
i
was
going
to
try
to
say
what
they
were
and
what
the
dominant
one
was.
there
is,
in
the
union,
a
primary
motive
which
seems
to
me
to
alleviate
hardship
and
a
subsidiary
motive
which
is
the
strengthening
of
the
strike.
i
think
to
allow
the
subsidiary
motive
to
determine
the
basic
issue
of
what
is
to
motive
that
the
government
is
arguing
some
motives.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
wouldn't
--
i
couldn't
quite
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
i
can't
quite
buy
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
i'll
--
and
the
reason
i
can't,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
i
think
the
--
the
heat
and
emotion
of
a
group
about
to
take
a
strike
code
does
not
really
consider
that.
they
had
--
they
are
taking
so
much
risk
so
beyond
the
poultry
1650
year,
so
much
more
are
they
putting
into
this
but
i
don't
consider
this
as
the
factor.
i
would
agree
that
once
out,
there
are
mixed
motives
here
and
--
but
that
the
dominant
motive
because
it
goes
to
strikers,
it
goes
to
nonmembers
it
goes
--
if
you
have
stops,
if
they
can
get
you
together
job
elsewhere
that
the
dominant
motive
is
the
relief
of
hardship.
and
may
i
say
that
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
you'd
be
first
i
think
on
the
knowledge
of
labor
law
history
to
recognize
that
a
union
is
different
from
a
corporation
in
relation
to
the
making
of
gifts.
that
union
started
as
for
internal
organizations
when
in
fact
the
law
prevented
them
from
striking
and
other
methods
in
restraining
the
thing.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
this
is
a
good
example
on
that,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
precisely
--
i
was
going
to
say
it's
unimportant.
i'm
just
trying
to
speak
with
precision.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
they
wouldn't
be
in
the
class
that
it's
given
to
their
partners.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
right.
you
must
be
a
striker.
this
is
strike
benefit.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
grandchildren
benefits,
you
have
to
be
a
grandchild.
if
you
have
strike
benefits,
you
have
to
be
a
striker
and
therefore,
when
they
went
back,
obviously
they
would
get
no
more.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
agree,
if
your
honor
please
that
there
were
in
the
unions
a
mixed
motivation
of
hardship
and
strengthening
this
--
of
alleviating
hardship
and
strengthening
striker.
i
simply
said
that
clearly
the
dominant
motivation
was
the
relief
of
hardship.
i
did
not
--
nor
i
take
the
position
that
motives
are
so
clear
--
that
they
are
not
mixed
motives
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
government
recognizes
this.
if
a
father
gives
money
to
his
child,
it
may
very
well
be
that
one
of
the
major
motives
is
the
avoidance
of
the
higher
income
tax
bracket
in
which
he
would
be.
he
may
write
his
son
and
saying,
“i
am
giving
you
a
million
dollars
because
in
this
way
you'll
be
paying
the
income
on
this
and
i
will
--
well
on
my
remaining
million
we'll
each
pay
half,”
we
each
pay
half
as
much
taxes
or
as
much
of
taxes
together,
that
is
still
a
gift.
the
business
motivation
does
not
affect
and
the
government
has
conceded
that
in
so
many
words.
in
other
--
in
other
words
i'm
suggesting
what
seems
to
be
clearly
the
law
that
a
mixed
motivation
will
not
defeat
him
if
there
--
is
a
primarily
donative
purpose
in
here,
the
hardship
seems
to
be
clearly
the
primary
purpose.
now,
i
would
just
take
in
conclusion
my
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
no,
sir.
we're
--
we've
always
been
perfect
clear
that
this
was
nontaxable
and
there
was
--
we'd
never
considered
going
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
to
commerce
and
as
the
government
has
never
gone
to
congress
and
asked
for
this.
it
seems
to
me
clearly
this
would
be
the
place
to
settle
it
on.
in
a
situation,
if
your
honor
please,
where
every
analogous
ruling,
they
may
not
be
identical,
but
every
ruling
within
a
mile
of
this
has
been
for
exemption
either
as
non-income
or
as
gift.
when
everything
within
a
mile
of
our
case
has
been
held
by
the
commissioner
not
to
be
taxable,
it
seems
to
me
if
he
wants
the
taxes
one
thing
out
of
the
whole
area
of
need,
certainly
the
place
to
go
is
the
congress
and
not
--
not
to
this
court
where
the
case
fell
out.
i
just
want
to
make
this
one
quote
before
my
red
light
goes
on
is
this.
when
you
--
somebody
asked
my
why
--
how
did
you
get
here?
i
certainly
wouldn't
have
enjoyed
being
--
we're
not
in
the
same
category
of
the
other
cases
that
you're
about
to
hear.
in
other
words,
we
got
here
first
then
along
came
two
other
cases
which
were
joined
with
it
by
the
court
which
are
wholly
different.
i
do
not
mean
to
reflect
on
the
merits
of
those
cases
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
under
this
court's
previous
rules,
those
--
both
those
cases
were
gifts
under
this
court's
previous
holdings.
but
whatever
there
maybe
--
whatever
maybe
the
decision
in
those
cases,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
us.
we
are
not
a
part
of
the
said
--
those
cases
both
involve
payment
for
services.
one
involves
a
man
who
did
another
man
a
business
favor
and
got
a
cadillac.
the
other
involves
a
pension
--
or
a
$20,000
payment
after
he
left.
both
of
these
involved
the
question
which
this
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
those
are
the
kind
of
payments
for
services
which
defeat
gifts.
there's
no
suggestion
in
our
case
of
a
service
of
any
kind.
so,
we
got
--
it
seems
to
me
that
while
we
are
in
this
--
while
this
is
one
of
three
cases
which
the
court
sat
down
to
gather
in
serving
our
case
is
totally
different
whatever
maybe
the
outcome.
