mr.
barnett,
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
douglas'
question
as
to
whether
this
is
the
question
of
law
of
fact
that
these
are
the
answered
questions
or
is
that
coming
at
the
end?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
guess
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
light
of
the
government,
list
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
answer
given
unequivocal
one
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
mean
--
i'm
content.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rauh,
this
case
could
be
decided
restrictively
to
the
facts
that
you
just
stated
which
i
take
for
granted
as
so.
is
that
why
we're
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
to
you
wasn't
hostile
because
if
that's
all
there
is
to
the
case,
i
don't
see
why
we
are
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
a
--
strikingly
just
a
very
particular
special
case,
but
that
isn't
the
norm
of
strike
benefit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
normal
strike
benefit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
just
--
i'm
not
asking
you
one
way
or
the
other.
just
want
to
know
the
case
about
it.
it's
what
you
said,
then
you
have
no
business
to
be
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
arguing
the
other
cases,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
it
give
us
the
benefit
of
your
wider
experience
with
the
unions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
the
difficulty
isn't'
trying
to
deal
with
these
questions
on
slogans
like
right,
benefit,
social
security
in
relation
to
tax
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
between
private
--
between
private
grant
to
public
grant,
there
may
be
a
difference
that's
valid
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
great
respect
to
the
government's
brief
on
speaking
isn't
to
be
limited
by
their
briefs,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
the
only
reason,
mr.
rauh.
it
might
not
be
tempting
to
go
out
on
strike
but
for
this
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
don't
need
any
factual
support.
i
would
know
something
without
ever
been
finding
tem
in
that
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
know,
it's
better
than
our
view
that
--
that
but
for
strike
that
the
presence
of
a
strike,
the
availability
of
the
strike
has
something
to
do
with
getting
people
to
go
on
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
accept.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
too
large
in
abstraction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
my
suggestion.
that
was
my
suggestion.
i
said
it
was
in
fact
in
getting
people
to
go
on
strike
or
to
stay
on
the
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he
--
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
very
much
bother
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
hasn't
implied
my
attitude
towards
the
problem
before
us,
but
i'm
surprised
if
you
would
deny
that
the
existence
of
a
strike
has
something
to
do
with
determining
the
recommendations
of
leaders
of
labor
whether
they
should
go
on
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
particular
thing.
i'm
talking
about
the
general
problem
of
what
motivates,
when
to
strike,
how
long
to
continue
it,
who's
to
call
in,
and
i
must
say
i'm
a
bit
surprised
that
you
are
so
(inaudible)
doesn't
affect
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
like
to
get
learning
where
i
can
get
it.
