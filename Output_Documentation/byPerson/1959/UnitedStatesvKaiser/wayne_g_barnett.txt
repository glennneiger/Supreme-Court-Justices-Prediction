mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
two
that
follow
it,
the
duberstein
case
and
the
stanton
case
are
income
tax
cases
all
involving
the
exclusion
from
income,
a
property
acquired
by
gift.
the
facts
of
the
three
cases
are
very
different.
this
case
involves
strike
benefits,
duberstein,
a
cadillac
given
as
--
in
return
for
business
favor
and
stanton,
a
$20,000
gratuity
given
by
a
corporation
to
a
resigning
officer.
we
believe,
however,
that
ultimately
the
cases
turn
on
a
common
problem
of
defining
what
a
gift
is.
in
stanton
and
duberstein,
the
problem
is
almost
solely
that
i.e
the
problem
of
definition.
and
once
that
question
is
resolved,
the
results
there
follow
almost
automatically.
in
this
case,
however,
there
are
additional
problems,
the
problem
of
applying
the
definition
to
the
facts
once
the
definition
is
arrived
at
and
also
an
entirely
independent
problem
of
whether
strike
benefits
are
income
from
the
definition
of
income
even
if
they're
not
gifts.
for
that
reason,
i
will,
in
this
case,
try
to
focus
on
the
problems
that
are
peculiar
to
this
case
and
leave
to
my
colleague,
mr.
edelman
the
development
of
the
basic
definition
of
gifts.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
in
april
of
1954,
the
united
automobile
workers
and
their
local
833
representing
the
employees
of
the
kohler
company,
in
kohler,
wisconsin
called
a
strike
of
those
employees
in
support
of
a
contract
demand.
shortly
after
the
strike
began,
the
international
established
a
strike
aid
program
under
which
the
strikers
were
given
financial
assistance
in
the
form
of
food
vouchers
redeemable
at
the
local
stores
and
the
direct
payment
of
rent
and
utility.
the
conditions
upon
which
strike
benefits
were
given
were
two
-
first
of
all,
of
course,
the
applicant
had
to
be
a
striker,
though
it
did
not
matter
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
union
as
long
as
he
was
a
striker.
the
second
was
that
he
established
his
need
that
he
had
no
other
sources
of
income
and
he
is
not
otherwise
employed
and
so
forth.
by
november
1957,
the
day
of
the
trial,
the
international
expended
over
$
9
million
in
strike
aid
to
the
kohler
employees.
the
money,
so
far
as
relevant
here
came
from
the
regular
strike
fund
of
the
international.
that
fund
had
been
created
by
a
provision
of
the
constitution
requiring
25
cents
of
the
regular
monthly
dues
of
every
member
to
be
set
aside
in
a
special
fund
to
be
used
exclusively
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
local
unions
engaged
in
authorized
strikes;
that
is
strikes
that
the
international
executive
board
had
approved.
this
case
is
essentially
a
test
case
to
establish
whether
or
not
those
benefits
are
taxable.
the
respondent
here
did
participate
in
the
strike.
he
was
not
member
of
the
union
at
the
time
the
strike
began,
nor
when
he
first
began
seeking
strike
benefits.
he
later
in
the
year
in
august,
he
did
join
the
union,
though
he
was
not
required
to
pay
initiation
fees
or
dues
because
he
was
on
strike.
the
benefits
that
he
received
amounted
to
$16.50
a
week.
this
was
the
rate
established
for
single
men,
he
had
no
dependents
and
over
the
balance
of
the
year,
he
received
a
total
of
$565
in
strike
benefits.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
that
isn't
at
all.
he
started
receiving
the
benefits
in
may
and
joined
the
union
in
august,
i
think
it
is,
and
it
would
be
a
pro
rata
part
of
the
total.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
do
not
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
was
right
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
we
do
not.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
striker,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
sorry.
the
commissioner,
who
has
ruled
that
strike
benefits
are
incomes
since
1920,
included
that
$565
in
respondent's
reported
income
increasing
the
total
reported
income
to
$3235
and
that
produced
a
deficiency
of
$108
in
tax.
the
deficiency
was
paid
and
suit
for
refund
was
brought.
the
district
court,
although
believing
that
there
was
no
question
of
the
fact
for
the
jury,
nevertheless,
in
order
to
provide
a
complete
record,
submitted
to
the
jury
the
question
whether
the
payments
were
a
gift.
the
jury
said
that
they
were.
the
district
court
set
aside
the
jury's
verdict
entered
judgment
for
the
government
holding
as
a
matter
of
law
that
those
benefits
were
income.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed,
holding
both
that
the
strike
benefits
were
gifts
within
the
exclusion
of
section
102
(a)
of
the
1954
code
and
alternatively
that
even
if
they
were
not
gifts
they
were
not
within
the
concept
of
income
as
defined
in
section
61
(a).
now
the
basis
for
both
holdings
of
ours
can
be
told
from
the
opinion.
it
is
essentially
the
same,
namely,
that
since
the
strike
benefits
were
payable
only
upon
showing
them
need,
their
payment
was
as
the
court
said
consistent
only
with
charity
and
that
decision
is
here
for
rehearing.
i
will
deal
first
with
the
question
of
whether
the
strike
benefits
were
gifts
and
later
with
the
question
of
their
income.
as
we
developed
more
fully
in
the
other
two
cases,
a
payment
for
which
there
is
no
obligation
and
no
bargain
for
exchange
is
not
necessarily
a
gift
for
tax
purposes,
and
the
problem
is
how
to
decide
when
it
is
and
when
it
isn't
and
as
we
would
later
develop,
it
depends
upon
the
reasons
why
the
payment
is
made.
if
it
is
made
for
essentially
personal
reason,
charity,
affection,
just
an
interested
generosity,
it
is
a
gift.
if
on
the
other
hand
is
made
for
business
reasons,
it
is
not
a
gift.
so
the
controlling
question
of
fact
in
this
case
as
in
the
others
is,
why
were
the
payments
made?
now
the
court
of
appeals
in
saying
they
were
made
out
of
charity,
based
that
solely
on
the
single
fact
that
need
was
one
of
the
conditions.
it
said
nothing
about
the
other
condition
that
you'd
be
on
strike
and
did
not
identify
who
it
is
who
is
moved
by
charity
and
one
of
the
things
you
have
to
identify,
to
pay
or
to
find
out
why
he's
made
the
payment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
is
not
sir.
it
is
not.
that
we
think
is
the
basic
difference
between
the
income
problem
and
the
gift
problem,
the
except
--
exclusive
for
gifts
has
something
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
payor's
act
and
it
is
to
that
that
you
have
to
look
to
make
the
distinction.
now
certainly
it
was
not
the
union
officers
executing
the
program
who
made
the
charitable
gift.
it
was
the
union's
funds,
not
their
fund
that
were
given
away
and
in
each
of
personal
charitable
impulses
they
personally
may
have
had
would
be
quite
irrelevant.
in
fact
the
benefits
were
paid
simply
in
execution
of
an
express
provision
of
the
union
constitution
providing
for
and
out
of
the
funds
established
by
that
constitution.
but
it
seems
to
us
evidently
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
constitution
to
find
out
why
they
were
made.
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
mention
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
the
respondent
just
barely
passes
over
them.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
by
taking
25
cents
out
of
the
monthly
dues
of
every
member
of
the
international.
that
is
the
crucial
provision
of
the
constitution
that's
in
our
view
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
article
16,
section
11
which
provides
for
the
fund,
and
provides
that
25
cents
out
of
the
monthly
dues
of
every
member
shall
be
set
aside
as
the
international
union
strike
fund.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
claim
first
that
there
is
a
--
it
is
a
mutual
protection
arrangement,
mutuality
in
that
--
by
this
provision,
all
the
members'
contribute
to
the
fund
and
each
receives
benefits
should
the
occasion
arise.
it
is
essentially
a
mutual
insurance.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
claim
that
whether
its
compensation
is
really
a
characterization
of
legal
result
and
for
purposes
of
the
--
putting
it
under
pigeon
hole
in
section
61
(a)
we
would
say
it
is
compensation.
i
don't
think
that
would
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
indirectly,
it
does.
i
would
come
to
that.
since
the
dues
paid
into
the
fund
by
the
union
members
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
just
the
union
members,
not
the
company.
this
is
solely
the
dues
paid
by
the
union
members
to
the
union.
part
of
that
goes
into
strike
fund
and
--
so,
the
source
of
the
money
is
--
is
the
union
dues.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
not
necessarily.
this
will
be
true
if
you
have
it
--
completely
unchanging
membership
and
they've
all
paid
in
the
dues
then
you
--
the
strike
is
all
paid
out
again
who
would
go
back
to
the
same
people.
but
we
can't
trace
these
dollars,
sue
them
by
that
way.
i
think
the
problem
is
to
characterize
the
nature
of
the
funds,
what
purpose
it
serves
and
i
think
the
fact
that
the
union
dues
are
deductible
to
the
members
when
it's
paid
into
the
fund,
and
they're
deductible
only
for
the
reason
that
the
fund
is
used
to
further
their
trade
or
business
i.e
their
employment
and
that
is
why
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
they
haven't
paid
for
their
employment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
because
part
of
that
they
were
paid,
they're
paid
over
as
union
dues
and
deducted.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
you
mean
the
allowance
or
the
deduction?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
under
the
general
trade
or
business
allowance
by
deduction
of
the
commissioner's
rule
that
it
is
a
legitimate
trade
or
business
expense.
now,
the
union
constitution
says
that
this
fund
made
up
of
union
dues
is
to
be
drawn
up
on
exclusively
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
local
unions
engaged
in
authorized
strikes
and
strikes
must
be
authorized
by
the
international
executive
board
and
the
strike
benefits
terminate
if
the
protective
board
orders
termination
of
the
strike.
now
to
say,
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
is
mutuality.
the
members
as
a
whole
are
not
giving
anything
to
anyone
else.
they're
pooling
their
resources
in
the
fund
for
their
mutual
protection,
and
each
ultimately
has
the
same
prospect
of
being
the
recipient
of
the
fund
should
the
occasion
arise.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
that
is
one
aspect.
to
the
extent
that
the
object
of
the
fund
is
solely
to
relieve
hardship
is
in
itself
not
to
promote
the
strike
or
anything
else,
just
the
relief
of
hardship
aspect,
we
say
it
is
still
not
charity
because
it
is
essentially
a
mutual
insurance
fund.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
only
life
insurance
and
insurance
proceeds
for
personal
injuries
are
excluded
by
the
code
and
it's
been
a
consistent
position
of
the
service
that
any
other
insurance
arrangement
results
in
a
taxable
gain.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
was
a
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
think
i
know
that
case,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
those
are
--
no.
those
are
specifically
excluded
by
the
code
and
it
is
part
of
our
argument
here
is
it
that
this
is
the
kind
of
judgment
that
congress
often
made
and
congress
has
made
it
in
a
number
of
areas.
and
it
should
make
it
here
if
judgment
is
to
be
made.
now,
as
i
say,
even
if
this
was
solely
to
relieve
hardship
in
and
of
itself,
it
would
not
be
charity
but
mutual
insurance
protection.
but
you
can't
--
there
is
not
a
full
explanation
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
it
was
only
to
relieve
hardship.
there's
no
reason
to
limit
it
to
strikers,
and
if
it's
limited
to
strikers,
limited
to
strikers
in
authorized
strikes.
so
the
fund
necessarily
has
something
to
do
with
the
conduct
of
strikes.
members
who
are
unemployed
for
other
reasons
do
not
receive
benefits.
it's
only
this
came
into
strike.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
they
are
not.
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
rulings
that
is
because
they
are
not
income.
this
goes
back
a
long
way
in
some
and
the
time
this
was
before
the
decision
in
glenshaw
glass,
when
they
move
it
they
thought
of
it
as
not
income.
i
think
they
can
be
readily
explained
as
being
insured
yes
because
they
are
made
only
out
of
a
base
just
interested
in
public
purpose.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
they're
not,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
by
rulings.
i
don
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
maybe
a
regulation.
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
informed
by
the
--
the
revenue
service
that
the
ruling
position
has
been
consistent.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
the
ruling
decision
position,
their
announced
position
has
always
been
consistent
that
these
are
taxable,
but
this
is
the
problem
always
encountered
in
dealing
with
--
with
small
returns.
the
service
can't
audit
all
small
returns.
they
do
only
very
selective
basis.
and
we
are
told
that
they
have
enforced
this
ruling
to
the
same
degree
that
they
are
able
to
police
these
returns
at
all
and
in
that
sense,
they
have
been
consistently
enforced.
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
major
drives
in
order
to
pick
up
a
specific
item.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
usually,
as
in
this
case,
the
--
they're
only
in
full
accounts.
the
taxes
involved
in
any
individual
taxpayers
case
as
here
is
$108
and
you
don't
have
suits
by
and
large
over
$108
and
we
are
told
that
they
have
picked
these
items
up
upon
order
when
they
ran
across
them.
we
don't
have
any
records.
none
of
the
records
have
broken
down
by
these
kinds
of
categories.
so
we
can't
really
say
to
what
extent
the
instant
occasions
have
actually
arisen.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
probably,
we
do
deal
with
that
in
our
reply
brief
but
that
is
filed
only
today.
we
take
exception
to
all
of
them
in
the
sense
that
in
our
view
they're
just
totally
inconsistent.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
believe
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
believe
not,
sir,
i
believe
not.
our
position
then
was
and
the
district
court
held
that
there
wasn't
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
the
reason
we
have
not
made
a
major
argument
about
the
instructions
is
just
it's
not
being
proper
to
argue
the
adequacy
instructions
until
you
will
cite
what
the
question
of
fact
is
that
--
that
you
want
to
present
it
to
the
jury
and
it's
our
position
that
once
you
go
through
the
definitional
problem
to
try
to
find
out
what
the
question
of
fact
is,
there
isn't
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
moved
for
directed
verdict
and
as
the
district
court
explained
it
in
its
later
opinion,
he
did
not
grant
the
directed
verdict,
only
ordered
to
have
a
complete
record.
so
he
--
he
went
ahead
and
submitted
the
case
to
the
jury
and
then
granted
our
motion
for
judgment
of
standing
the
verdict.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
yes,
he
did.
he
did.
we
don't
think
that's
a
question
for
the
jury,
the
construction
of
the
union
constitution.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
difficulty
with
the
instructions,
it
seems
to
me,
is
--
well
i
will
give
you
one
example
of
the
kind
of
inconsistency.
part
of
the
instructions
are
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
american
dental,
in
which
say
that
the
fact
that
the
motives
leaving
--
leading
to
the
payment
may
have
been
grounded
on
business
reasons
or
even
selfishness,
is
not
controlling.
he
told
that
--
he
told
that
to
the
jury.
then
he
told
the
jury
that
they
were
gifts
only
it
was
so
because
of
personal
regard
or
pity
or
from
general
motives
of
(inaudible)
or
charity.
now
i
do
not
reconcile
those
two
instructions.
i
don't
believe
the
jury
can
reconcile
that.
they
are
diametrically
opposed
concepts
of
what
a
gift
is.
as
i
say,
we
developed
at
some
length
in
the
other
cases
a
definition
of
the
gift
and
it's
called
that
is
the
main
issue
in
those
cases,
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
lot
of
other
problems.
i
am
somewhat
begging
the
question
by
just
asserting
here
what
we
think
is
the
controlling
factual
issue.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they're
always
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right.
the
--
there
is
no
explanation.
none
has
been
offered
by
anyone
consistent
with
our
definition
of
what
a
gift
is
for
the
fact
that
the
strike
fund
provisions
of
the
constitution
limit
the
distributions
to
strikers.
unless
someone
could
offer
an
explanation
of
that
provision
which
is
consistent
with
the
definition
of
a
gift,
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
an
issue
of
fact.
you
have
to
explain
it
and
also
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
fact
of
the
mutuality
of
the
insurance
--
of
the
strike
fund
provisions.
the
agreement
that
if
you
support
our
strike,
we
will
support
your
strikes
precludes
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
being
a
gift.
the
--
now,
as
i
say,
it
is
not
a
complete
explanation
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
we
don't
think
that's
the
question.
we
don't
think
the
question
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
--
it's
not
a
great
deal
of
elaboration,
that
the
question
is
not
one
of
the
intentions.
it's
not
what
you
intend
to
do.
it
is
what
moved
you
to
do
it.
just
to
use
terms
that
will
make
distinction
we
call
it
intent
and
motive
as
the
distinction
and
the
question
is
--
is
the
motivating
force,
not
what
you
intended
to
be
when
you
make
the
payment.
now,
this
is
--
runs
through
all
the
instructions
here.
and
as
i
say,
in
part,
we
were
arguing
these
cases
in
the
wrong
order.
this
case
should
have
come
last
because
we
could
develop
these
basic
definitional
problems
first,
but
if
you
bear
with
me
for
the
moment,
and
i
feel
that
the
question
is
why
the
payment
is
made.
what
induced
the
person
in
making
to
make
it
and
that
that
must
be
a
personal
charitable
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
particularly
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
yes,
but
he
later
says
that
it
is
not
controlling
that
it
was
made
out
of
business
mode,
these
are
--
are
for
selfish
and
business
reasons.
now
we
could
by
picking
and
choosing,
pick
out
instructions
that
we
could
agree
with
but
others
that
we
don't
agree
with
and
which
are
diametrically
opposed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
that
question
--
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
if
i
may
say
--
excuse
me.
that
question
must
always
come
at
the
end.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
you
need
first
to
go
through
the
problem
to
find
out
what
it
is
that
turns
on
and
then
decide
whether
that
was
the
question
of
fact.
here,
we
think
it
turns
on
nothing
more
than
the
fact
that
the
union
constitution
limits
the
benefits
to
strikers.
there's
no
question
of
fact
about
that.
that's
agreed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
yes.
but
usually
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
you
don't
give
food
just
to
give
food.
something
has
induced
you
to
do
that.
you
may
do
it
--
you
may
do
it
because
he
worked
for
you
for
41
years
and
he
has
now
retired
in
of
old
age
and
he
has
no
money.
now,
we
say
that
that's
why
you
gave
it
to
me,
its
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
not
necessarily
some
years
later.
a
case
i'm
thinking
of
is
peters
v.
smith
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
which
is
a
department
store,
a
corporation,
retired
people,
when
they
became
too
old
to
physically
carry
out
their
duties
and
gave
them
pensions,
pensions
that
were
determined
by
need.
now,
we
say
that
there's
no
difference
between
that
and
any
other
kind
of
pension
arrangement
and
that
is
compensation
for
the
past
services.
that's
why
i
say
–
if
on
the
other
hand
i
am
giving
you
the
food
until
--
only
because
my
sense
of
charity,
my
duty
to
society
or
because
you're
my
relative,
then
it's
clearly
a
gift.
that's
what
i
mean
by
the
difference
and
the
reasons
why
you
make
the
payment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there's
no
contract
to
give
this
man
anything,
but
there
is
a
contract
among
the
members
of
the
union
as
a
whole
that
they
will
all
contribute
25
cents
a
month
to
a
fund
which
will
be
used
solely
in
--
solely
in
their
strikes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
remember
how
he
put
it.
what
i
would
say
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
163.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
is
the
accepted
facts
that
that
he
had
to
be
a
striker
in
order
to
get
the
payment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
yes.
we
may
know
these
agreements
that
that
one
of
the
conditions
need,
that
was
established
by
needs
and
the
distributions
are
proportion
to
your
needs.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
yes,
sir
and
not
only
--
not
that
by
itself
is
the
difference.
i
think
if
this
interested
organization
have
any
ideological
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
strike
could
make
payments
for
the
limited
strikers,
it
would
be
gifts.
the
difference
is
that
the
payor
here,
the
union
--
we'll
first
look
in
through
the
union
to
the
members
that
comprise
of
differences
to
the
mutual
--
the
mutual
rights
given
them
by
the
--
by
the
fund.
they
contribute
to
funds
which
will
afford
protection
for
them.
they
aren't
giving
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
to
--
i'm
just
asking
if
--
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
this
is
a
fund
which
will
be
distributed
only
to
the
members
of
the
group.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
think
that
would
not
be.
i
don't
see
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
well,
i
maybe
shifting
down
slightly
here.
the
explanation
of
why
these
are
given
to
strikers
and
it
must
be
that
in
some
way
further
the
strike.
now
the
strike
is
brought
on
by
the
union
to
gain
economic
benefits
for
the
employees.
now,
if
the
union
were
in
fact
only
a
disinterested
organization,
if
we
treat
the
union
itself
as
being
charitable,
i
think
that
still
would
be
all
right,
but
we
don't
treat
unions
as
charitable
organizations.
whatever
--
they
may
have
certain
lots
of
needs,
but
they
are
primarily
concerned
of
promoting
the
economic
welfare
of
the
people
that
it
represents.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
no
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
since
1920.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
as
i
answered
the
chief
justice,
we
have
no
records
of
the
extent
to
which
people
actually
pay
taxes
when
he
announced.
this
has
been
the
standing
policy
and
when
the
issue
arises
in
a
spot
audit,
it
has
been
enforced
so
far
as
we're
able
to
determine,
but
there's
just
no
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
no
sir.
there's
a
letter
in
the
back
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
from
--
from
the
commissioner
explaining
the
administrative
practice
and
the
reason
why
there
are
no
statistics.
it
has
been
back
for
our
petition
in
our
brief.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
it
were
limited
to
unemployed
members,
generally
not
strikers.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
not
necessarily
strikers.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
(inaudible)
fact
the
striker
if
the
policy
is
to
give
it
to
all
unemployed
members.
it's
only
because
this
is
limited
to
strikers
that
we
rely
upon
that
aspect.
now,
in
fact
i
think
the
unemployment
benefits
paid
by
the
union
would
also
be
taxable
because
of
the
insurance
aspect
that
they
pay
them
dues
for
this
insurance
protection.
and
as
in
all
other
kinds
of
insurance
other
than
that
specifically
excluded
to
gain
over
the
premiums,
the
contribution
of
this
taxable
income.
now,
certainly
it
would
not
be
a
gift.
actually
we
think
that
the
--
the
open
question
isn't
a
gift
question
but
rather
the
income
question
because
we
don't
see
how
you
can
say
this
is
a
gift.
there's
no
giver.
they're
all
working
for
the
mutual
benefit
and
the
question
really
is
whether
it's
a
gift
--
sir,
i'm
sorry,
whether
it's
income
or
not
income
and
we
think
the
glenshaw
glass
case
has
put
that
question
to
congress
and
not
to
the
court.
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
