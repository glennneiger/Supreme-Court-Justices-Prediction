the
statute,
of
course,
was
not
restricted
to
faculty
members
of
the
university,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
that's
--
is
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
throughout
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
there
not
a
statutory
exemption
or
regulatory
exemption
as
to
non-sensitive
employment
or
some
sort
of
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
oath
appears
on
page
9
of
the
appendix
to
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
--
was
the
formerly
oath
left
up
to
the
employing
agency
in
each
case
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
now,
this
case
began
as
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
these
people,
of
course,
have
not
been
discharged.
there
is
an
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
injunction
against
their
being
discharged.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course,
if
--
and
--
and
these
people
have,
in
fact,
personally
been
told
and
advised
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington
that
scienter
is
required
in
this
very
case
if
they
know.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
if
anybody
ever
has
been
discharged?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
--
so
that
the
hearing
provisions
of
section
15
really
don't
help
us
in
the
--
on
the
question
whether
a
hearing
will
be
given
to
one
who
fails
or
refuses
to
sign
an
oath,
isn't
that
so?
