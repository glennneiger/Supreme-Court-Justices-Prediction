justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
covered
you
to
tell
to
us
about
the
two
professors,
what
their
status
is
as
of
this
moment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
the
supreme
court
vacated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
stay
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they're
in
full
--
in
full
occupation
of
their
post.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
more
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
surprised
if
the
university
joined.
what
function
did
he
--
would
he
exercise
under
the
requirement
of
the
statute?
has
he
any
independent
responsibility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
is
signed
--
he
signed
a
piece
of
paper
that
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
was
--
was
this
president
odegaard
or
his
predecessor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
judge
writes
an
opinion
and
a
petition
to
his
conclusions
of
law
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
judge
wright,
the
trial
judge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
filed
an
opinion
in
addition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
a
conclusion
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
in
here
is
all
we
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
asked
you,
there's
some
question
as
to
what
issues
were
raised
before
him
and
what
issues
he
adjudicated.
we
have
to
determine
of
whether
what
questions
are
before
us,
from
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
i
take
it
that
would
be
your
view,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
divert
you.
i
just
wanted
rather
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wondered
what
there
was
before
the
trial
judge,
but
we
don't
know
that
except
what
--
as
we
get
it
from
his
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
petition
here,
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
counts
that
he
--
on
counts
that
he,
himself,
adjudicated
the
matters
on
the
basis
on
which
you've
asked
him
to
adjudicate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
for
he
restricted
himself
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
what
justice
--
it's
unquestionable
that
yours
--
that
the
state
supreme
court
dealt
with
questions
under
the
federal
constitution.
what
the
state
claims
is
the
claim
of
the
state
that
the
decision
may
rest
exclusively
on
the
state
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
federal
constitutional
questions
are
--
or
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court
and
were
necessary
to
bear
decisions
and
this
case
can't
rest
on
exclusively
state
grounds?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
an
oath
like
the
wieman
and
updegraff
oath?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
is
broad
as
that,
it
appears
subversive
organization
without
defining
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
is
it
defined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
--
was
there
a
definition
in
the
wieman
and
updegraff
as
to
what
is
subversive
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
also
included
that
belonging
to
any
organization
of
the
attorney
general's
list?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
very
good
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
we
--
we
--
this
court
has
held
that
the
so-called
“out
glory”
or
the
condemnation
of
the
inclusion
on
the
attorney
general's
list
was
in
the
joint
anti-fascist
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
too
--
too
undefined
and
unlimited.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
it
--
it
had
--
it
included
organizations
that
might
be
of
innocence
as
the
republican
or
democratic
party.
i
don't
how
innocent
they
are
but
as
much
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
innocent
as
they
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
attorney
general's
list
wasn't
restricted
to
such
organization.
besides,
i
have
nothing
to
bind
what
the
attorney
general
could
put
on
his
list.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
had
to
know
that
one
of
these
--
i
don't
know
how
many
years,
100
odd
organizations.
you
had
to
know
that
one
of
these
organizations
was
pursuing
the
purposes
that
in
your
statute
is
defined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
because
--
but
that
was
inclusive.
therefore,
for
all
you
know,
he
might
be
a
member
of
a
--
of
an
organization
that
philosophically
discussed
all
sorts
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
supreme
--
did
you
--
has
your
supreme
court
held
that
there
must
be
scienter,
you're
coming
to
that,
you
can
argue
that
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
suit
yourself.i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
want
to
know
whether
your
supreme
court
has
held
that
scienter
is
a
requisite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
it's
implied?
does
that
mean
that
there
must
be
--
that
if
a
fellow
can
say,
“i
didn't
have
knowledge,”
that
would
be
a
good
defense
and
he
couldn't
be
dismissed
then?
if
it's
a
requisite
and
if
it's
implied,
legally
speaking,
it's
no
different
than
if
it's
written
there,
but
what
is
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
required
to
other
statute
as
you
conceive
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
a
particular
case,
suppose
professor
jones
is
now
sought
to
be
dismissed
under
this
statute,
which
you
tell
me
requires
scienter,
could
you
attack
his
discharge
by
saying
that
he
did
not
have
scienter?
i'm
not
talking
about
attacking
the
statute,
the
--
the
particular
case
of
professor
jones,
and
if
the
supreme
court
followed
its
ruling
and
conversely
admits
that
he
didn't
have
scienter,
wouldn't
your
supreme
court
have
to
say
that
they
--
he
could
not
be
dismissed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
communist
party,
a
fellow
knowingly
belongs
to
the
communist
party,
that's
all
you
have
to
show.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
must
knowingly
belong
to
that
party.
he
couldn't
have
been
--
he
couldn't
have
--
he
--
he
could've
join
as,
well,
in
some
(inaudible)
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
person
may
know
something
not
merely
on
the
tag
that
everybody
is
supposed
to
know
the
law,
but
it
maybe
such
a
common
--
maybe
it's
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
particular
by
a
professor
as
to
what
have
been
declared
on
this
subject
by
a
court.
i'm
not
saying
that
--
that
necessarily
follows
but
it
isn't
excluded
because
it
isn't
written
in
words
and
lots
of
things
we
know
that
aren't
written
in
words
because,
as
you
say,
it's
implied.
that's
why
the
problem
of
scienter
is
so
important
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
our
case
is
regarding
whether
any
--
if
he
was
involved.
i
think
the
case
involving
that
we
said
that
their
purpose
was
to
enforce
of
his
legal
aid
to
promote
the
enforcement
of
a
--
of
the
constitution
to
wit
the
fourteenth
amendment,
isn't
that
we've
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
same,
they
belong
to
an
organization
that
seeks
to
overturn
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that
argument,
that's
a
different
argument,
namely,
the
--
to
characterize
the
communist
party
as
a
force
or
violence
party
is
--
is
an
intrusion
into
whatever
(inaudible)
person
may
have
because
you
say
that's
an
arbitrary
determination
which
the
legislature
can't
make,
that's
your
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
this
point.
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
of
--
of
assuming
that
what
is
outlawed
is
knowing
membership
in
a
force
or
violence
party,
i
just
--
i
just
--
when
you
(inaudible)
that's
just
like
(inaudible)
i
just
thought
that
black
isn't
white
and
white
isn't
black.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
each
case,
in
each
case,
although
the
--
although
the
man
is
affiliated
in
a
knowing
way
with
an
enterprise
which
seems
to
overthrow
the
--
this
government
by
force
and
violence
as
something
in
our
constitution
which
prevent
a
state
from
saying,
“i
need
to
keep
such
a
person
employed
until
i
examined
each
persons
whether
he
understands
thoroughly
the
catechism
according
to
karl
marx
and
lenin,
whether
he
believes
in
it,”
etcetera,
etcetera,
that's
your
position,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
proves
that's
--
that
bars
me
from
saying
that
if
i
voluntarily
belong
in
a
--
to
an
organization,
the
purposes
of
which
i
know
and
i
belong
and
by
my
joining
add
strength
to
that
organization
but
i
must
be
put
on
the
witness
stand
and
then
have
a
right
constitutionally
to
be
--
be
searched
to
what
extent
i
adopt
that
catechism,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
assuming
anything,
i'm
putting
question.
i'm
just
assuming
the
question
i
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
provision
in
the
--
in
any
laws,
what
are
they
called,
bylaws,
is
there
any
provision
in
the
matter
that
govern
the
intramural
life
of
the
university
of
washington
regarding
disciplinary
action
against
nothing
of
the
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
inviting?
are
they
--
are
they
just
subtracted
or
are
they
formulated
by
--
in
some
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--how
do
you
determine
in
your
state,
how
a
thing
is
squarely
raised
before
the
supreme
court?
is
there
some
notice
of
appeal?
is
there
some
document
by
which
the
supreme
court
is
appraised
of
what
it
is
that
bare
to
adjudicate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
latter
--
is
the
latter,
assignments
of
error,
is
that
a
requirement
--
the
rule
of
your
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
specific
assignment
that
there
is
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
notice
of
appeal
coming
to
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
they
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
raised
--
they
raised
a
hearing
point
but
not
this
one.
their
first
point
was
that
no
hearing
was
afforded
employee
as
to
character
of
the
listed
organization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
their
argument
begins,
they
say
argument
in
support
of
judgement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
haven't
got
13,
but
i
go
to
the
points
they
make
and
they
begin
argument
in
support
of
judgments,
the
attorney
general's
list
and
the
first
argument
under
the
heading
“argument
in
support
of
judgment”.
there
is
no
hearing
afforded
employee
as
to
character
of
this
organization.
and
they
then
have
50
more
pages,
49
to
50
more
pages.
and
that
argument,
i
do
not
think,
is
made
and
i
do
not
find
it
in
the
summary,
summary
and
conclusions
on
page
85,
86.
there
are
eight
points
in
the
parenthesized
paragraph
form.
i
do
not
find
that
unless
oversight
skips
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
each
might
be
taken
in
a
special
position,
professor
of
--
of
history?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
football
coach
a
member
of
the
faculty
of
washington?
i
hope
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
case
that
we
have
before
us.
it
doesn't
differentiate
among
professors
according
to
the
subject
matter
of
their
teaching
or
research,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
the
--
in
the
loose
sense
of
the
term
there's
a
penalty
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
isn't
for
past
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
penalty
in
--
in
the
loose
way
in
which
this
is
used,
namely,
something
that
hurts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
was
an
individual
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
whole
concept
of
bill
of
attainder
to
question
that
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
your
point
really
that
--
that
this
is
post
facto
which
tells
you
either
consequence
is
not
something
in
the
past
but
something
in
--
in
the
present,
therefore
in
the
future?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
seem
to
find
more
comfort
from
what
i've
said
than
i
got
from
anybody
else
in
saying
[laughter].
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
why
i've
been
trying
to
stop
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
been
trying
to
stop
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it
wasn't
the
dissent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
do
you
think
that's
(inaudible)
from
(e)
of
your
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
page
64.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
will
read,
that
shall
mean
that
a
man
must
throw
a
bomb?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
gerende
case.
just
the
sentence
that
justice
black
read,
does
that
mean
the
man
must
throw
a
bomb
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
be
engaged
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
he
might
write
a
--
might
write
a
powerful
pamphlet.
we've
heard
again
and
again
with
a
pamphlet,
that
idea
is
weapons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
we
held
we've
had
cases
in
this
court
in
which
people
have
been
sent
to
jail
for
long
years
for
spreading
documents
apart
--
among
soldiers
or
officers
and
thereby,
obstructing
the
war
effort.
you
have
to
throw
bombs
in
order
to
be
mischievous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
asking
you
whether
--
whether
disseminating
literature
is
engaged
in
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
opinions
of
this
court
don't
show
that
that
which
may
have
been
sustained
but
necessary
or
even
desirable.
all
it
shows
it
didn't
transgress
constitutional
limits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
is
(inaudible)
in
affirmative
judgment
on
the
wisdom
or
desirability
or
need
of
any
legislation
that
makes
a
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
as
to
its
need.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
think
(inaudible)
legislation
one
does
think
(inaudible)
legislation
that
doesn't
seem
to
--
it
doesn't
offend
the
limits
of
constitutional
authority
of
states
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
all
guessing
as
to
what
the
washington
supreme
court
will
say
what
its
statute
means.
that's
necessary
the
guess
by
everybody
on
this
bench
or
off
the
bench.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
--
am
i
wrong,
as
i
read
complete
through
your
86-paged
brief
in
the
supreme
court
too
hurriedly
to
have
missed
that
you
discussed
this
opinion
in
that
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
what
heading
does
that
come?
and
just
with
the
--
the
heading,
thinking
that
the
heading
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
first
point
was
the
hearing
as
to
the
nature
of
the
organization,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
heading
under
which
this
appears?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
the
discussion
of
the
requirement
of
a
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
maybe
--
maybe
it
was.
all
i
said
was
when
i
saw
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
headings
that
scienter
was
required,
i
didn't
think
i'd
find
under
it
a
discussion
of
hearing
that
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
your
brief
in
the
record,
but
i
do
not
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no
because
that
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
even
beyond.
in
the
supreme
court,
we
have
the
appellant
brief,
but
we
