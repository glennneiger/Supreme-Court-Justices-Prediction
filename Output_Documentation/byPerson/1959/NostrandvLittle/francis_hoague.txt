mr.
francis
hoague
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington,
which
judgment
sustained
or
held
constitutional,
the
provisions
of
a
certain
statute
which
i
will
describe
to
you
shortly.
the
appellants
are
two
full
professors
at
the
university
of
washington,
which
is
a
state
university
having
tenure
on
--
being
the
professors,
have
tenure
and
with
certain
retirement
rights.
the
appellees
are
the
state
attorney
general,
the
president
of
the
university
and
the
board
of
regents
in
charged
of
the
university.
excuse
me,
did
i
say
the
appellants?
i
mean
the
appellees
are
the
attorney
general
and
the
board
of
regents
and
the
president.
the
facts
are
established
by
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
which
are
set
out
on
pages
8
and
9
of
the
record.
they
show
that
in
1955,
pursuant
to
a
statute
that
had
been
passed
shortly
before
the
spring
of
1955
by
the
legislature,
the
appellants
were
directed
by
the
appellees
to
execute
an
oath
that
they
did
not
belong
to
the
communist
party
or
to
any
other
subversive
organization
as
defined
in
the
statute.
and
they
--
it
was
stated
that
if
they
did
not
sign
this
oath
and
the
oath
is
set
forth
in
appendix
c
into
appellants'
brief,
they
did
not
sign
this
oath,
they
would
--
they
would
lose
their
employment.
their
employment
would
be
terminated
and
there
would
be
loss
of
tenure
in
retirement.
now,
they,
thereupon,
filed
a
petition
in
the
state
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment
seeking
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
act
and
restraining
the
insistence
on
the
signing
of
the
oath.
in
this,
the
petition,
it
was
asserted
that
a
statute,
pursuant
to
which
this
oath
was
presented,
violated
the
state
and
the
federal
constitution.
insofar
as
the
federal
constitution
is
involved,
it
was
said
that
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law,
that
there
was
a
--
an
abrogation
of
freedom
of
speech
and
assembly
and
that
the
statute
constituted
a
bill
of
a
tenure.
now,
i
will
describe
the
statute
which
is
charged
that
the
constitutionality
of
which
is
challenged,
it
is
set
forth
at
page
5
--
and
pages
5
and
6
of
our
appendix.
section
1
of
the
statute,
this
is
the
1955
statute,
says
that,
"every
department
or
agency
of
the
state
of
washington
or
of
any
county
or
city
in
the
state
of
washington,
shall
require
every
employee
to
sign
an
affidavit
as
to
whether
or
not
he
or
she
belongs
to
the
communist
party
or
other
subversive
organization."
now,
this
is
--
this
refers
to
not
prior
membership,
but
membership
at
the
time
of
signing
the
oath.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
"refusal
to
answer
this
--
this
question
on
any
grounds,
shall
be
a
cause
for
immediate
dismissal
from
employment."
section
4
of
the
1955
act
provides
that
the
communist
party
is
a
subversive
organization
and
that
membership
in
the
communist
party
shall
be
a
subversive
activity
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
an
injunction,
temporary
injunction,
was
issued
and
they
are
in
full
tenure
right
now.
mr.
francis
hoague
we
--
we
obtained
a
stay
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
of
the
vacation.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
hoague
not
a
discretionary
responsibility.
no,
but
an
executive
responsibility
seems
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
think
he
did
sign
a
piece
of
paper,
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
this
was
his
predecessor,
president
schmitz.
and
there's
been
a
substitution
since
then.
there
is
a
--
this
1955
statute,
i
should
say,
is
amendatory
of
a
more
comprehensive
subversive
activities
statute
that
had
been
enacted
in
1951.
and
there's
a
part
of
that
--
that
statute
section
060
--
9.81.060,
which
bears
on
this
and
that
provides
that
"no
person
--
no
subversive
person
or
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization
shall
be
eligible
for
employment
in
a
state
county
or
municipal
office."
now,
the
trial
court
first
issued
a
temporary
injunction
and
then
on
hearing,
found
that
the
statute
violated
the
state
constitution
in
several
respects
and
issued
an
injunction
as
paid
for.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
held
unconstitutional
a
section
of
the
statute
which
attempted
to
incorporate
the
united
states
attorneys
--
attorney
general's
subversive
organization
list,
into
it.
they
held
that
that
was
unconstitutional
by
reason
of
violating
the
state
constitution,
but
held
valid
the
balance
of
the
statute
and
the
oath
requirement.
mr.
francis
hoague
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
didn't
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
francis
hoague
just
findings
of
fact
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
now
--
mr.
francis
hoague
from
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
and
from
certain
portions
of
our
brief
to
the
supreme
court
and
certain
portions
of
our
petition
for
rehearing,
which
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
has
not
been
printed,
but
it's
part
of
the
unprinted
record
here
in
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
as
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
perfectly
all
right.
mr.
francis
hoague
and
--
no.
and
--
and
from
our
petition
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
no.
no
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
to
the
--
to
the
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
trial
judge.
mr.
francis
hoague
he
did
--
the
trial
judge
adjudicated
it
on
the
basis
of
the
state
constitution,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
restricted
himself
to
the
state
constitution
entirely.
mr.
francis
hoague
there's
no
--
no
problem
there.
then
when
the
appeal
went
up,
you
see,
the
appellant,
that
is
the
appellees
here,
argued
merely
the
state
constitutional
issues
in
their
brief.
we,
in
turn,
argued
the
federal
constitutional
--
well,
the
--
the
--
all
of
--
all
of
the
issues
that
we
intended
to
raise.
mr.
francis
hoague
what
state
supreme
court?
mr.
francis
hoague
no.
mr.
francis
hoague
they
were
identical.
of
course,
they
were
spelled
out
in
much
greater
detail.
that
--
but
this
is,
i
think,
what
counsel
is
referring
to
in
our
petition.
we
just
set
out
the
--
that
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
we
did
not
spell
it
out
in
the
petition
obviously.
in
the
--
before
the
state
supreme
court,
we
spelled
it
out
somewhat
more.
we
didn't
devote
the
entire
brief
to
that
issue.
we
did
mention
many
of
the
same
--
actually,
the
same
words
that
are
in
our
brief
here.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
there
was.
i
do
not
know
whether
it's
in
the
--
before
the
--
no,
it
is
not
before
this
court,
your
honor.
there
wasn't
a
trial
--
trial
brief,
but
it's
not
included
to
that.
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes
--
that's
--
that's
in
the
state,
so
if
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
francis
hoague
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
will
remember
that,
in
this
case,
we
are
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
washington
state
statute
which
requires,
in
this
case,
two
professors
to
take
an
oath
that
they
do
not
belong
to
any
subversive
organization
on
pains
of
being
immediately
fired
in
the
event
they
don't
take
the
oath.
mr.
francis
hoague
not
of
it,
no,
i
was
referring
in
this
case
only.
mr.
francis
hoague
the
statute
covers
all
state,
county
and
city
employees.
mr.
francis
hoague
unless
they
are
exempted
by
--
throughout
the
state,
unless
they
are
exempted
by
special
act
of
--
action
on
the
part
of
the
--
a
board
or
agency.
mr.
francis
hoague
no.
mr.
francis
hoague
no.
mr.
francis
hoague
section
2
of
the
1955
act
provides
that
an
agency
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that
appears
on
page
6
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
that
an
agency
may
--
well,
in
some
excused
certain
people,
if
it
is
--
if
they
--
if
the
agency
finds
that
their
--
the
employment
of
such
persons
will
not
be
dangerous
to
the
health
of
the
citizens
and
the
security
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
francis
hoague
is
employed.
mr.
francis
hoague
not
a
special
agency.
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
francis
hoague
with
the
court's
leave,
it
is
our
intention
that
i
will
address
the
court
particularly
on
a
due
process
aspects
of
our
argument
and
mr.
ringold
will
deal
with
the
bill
of
attainder
and
first
amendment
aspects.
of
the
--
statute
under
inquiry
here,
provides
that
--
i
think
i'd
better
read
it
rather
than
quote
it,
that
refusal
to
answer
on
any
grounds
shall
be
cause
for
immediate
termination
of
such
employee's
employment.
and
this,
the
no
provision
is
for
hearing
is
afforded
by
the
statute.
there's
no
opportunity
for
the
employee
to
explain
his
reason
for
failing
to
or
refusing
to
sign
the
oath.
now,
we
submit
that
we
concede
that
a
state
may
inquire
into
the
fitness
of
any
employee
and
into
the
loyalty
of
any
employee.
but
that
inquiry
must
accord
with
fair
procedure.
there
must
be
a
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself
or
to
explain.
this
requirement
was
first
acknowledged
in
the
adler
case,
adler
against
the
board,
but
in
that
case,
the
court
found
that
the
feinberg
act
of
new
york
provided
an
adequate
hearing
opportunity
to
explain
and
in
the
--
even
found
that
the
feinberg
act
only
gave
rise
to
a
prima
facie
presumption
of
disloyalty
which
would
be
overcome
by
any
testimony.
in
the
slochower
case,
the
court
recognized
that
when
a
person
is
--
well,
the
slochower
case
was
decide
--
appears
to
have
been
decided
on
two
issues.
one
was
that
the
--
the
claiming
needs
--
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
cannot
give
rise
to
a
presumption
of
guilt.
and
on
the
further
that
since
there
was
no
hearing
afforded
the
employee
that
the
summary
dismissal
of
him
was
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
we
submit
that
that
case
is
--
the
reasoning
of
that
case
is
directly
applicable
to
this
act.
now,
of
course,
the
reasoning
back
of
this
is
that
a
hearing
is
necessary
to
render
this
firing
process
or
discharge
process
an
inquiry
into
the
fitness
of
the
employee
in
any
real
sense,
otherwise,
the
firing
procedure
bares
only
a
broad
sort
of
dragnet
relationship
to
fitness
or
security
of
the
employee.
it
is
an
--
because
there,
it
is
--
well,
it
is
an
arbitrary
classification
of
the
fit
with
the
unfit
and
firing
of
all
of
them
in
order
to
get
at
the
lesser
number
who
may
--
who
may
be
unfit
or
disloyal.
and
insofar
as
it
is
--
is
an
arbitrary
classification,
it
comes
in
conflict
with
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
wieman
against
updegraff,
the
signing
--
the
refusal
of
--
to
sign
the
oath
by
itself
bares
no
reasonable
relationship
to
disloyalty.
it
is
certainly
a
ground
for
suspicion
of
disloyalty.
and
that
would
give
rise
to
maybe
inquiry
as
to
whether
their
suspicions
were
well
founded.
but
in
and
of
itself,
the
--
it
is
improper
for
the
legislature
to
say
a
refusal
to
take
an
oath
means
that
the
person
shall
be
immediately
discharged.
so,
the
court
below
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
your
honor,
the
--
it's
--
it
will
--
it
is
like,
you'd
accepted
--
i
think
in
wieman
and
updegraff,
it
implied
retroactively,
if
it
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
the
oath
--
oath
is
on
page
9
of
the
brief.
i'm
--
i'm
--
i
--
my
memory
is
that,
and
it
maybe
wrong,
that
in
wieman
against
updegraff,
it
required
and
just
whether
they
had
not
belong
to
a
subversive
organization.
and
this
only
requires
that
they
swear
that
they
do
not,
at
the
time
they're
signing
the
oath,
belong
to
a
subversive
organization.
mr.
francis
hoague
no
it's
subversive
organization
as
defined
in
the
act.
mr.
francis
hoague
it's
defined
in
the
more
or
less
usual
very
common
form,
subversive
organization,
this
is
--
i'm
reading
from
page
1
of
appendix
a,
“subversive
organization
means
an
organization
which
engages
in,
advocates,
abets,
advises,
teaches
or
a
purpose
of
which
is
to
engage
in,
advocate,
abet,
advise
or
teach
activities
intended
to
overthrow,
destroy
or
alter
or
to
assist
in
the
overthrow,
destruction
or
alteration
of
any
--
of
the
constitutional
form
of
the
united
states
by,”
and
i
will
skip,
if
i
may,
“revolution
force
or
violence”.
mr.
francis
hoague
that
was
a
--
i
do
not
advocate
that
i
am
a
member
of
any
organization
that
now
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
it
describes
in
the
oath
what
is
here
described
in
the
statute
and
not
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
that
is
a
different
thing
at
this
stage
of
the
--
of
our
--
of
our
case.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
but,
your
honor,
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
wieman
against
updegraff
decision
which
knocked
out
the
entire
oath
as
applied
to
any
organizations
as
subversive
organization.
mr.
francis
hoague
[laughs]
mr.
francis
hoague
not
--
not
if
they
--
if
they
were
involved
in
--
add
for
their
purpose
to
overthrow
the
government.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
but
this
is
also
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
it
was
the
--
mr.
francis
hoague
excuse
me.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
that
was,
that
was
the
scienter
and
--
and
--
mr.
francis
hoague
and
also
in
the
other
organization,
your
honor,
that
says
“i'm
--
i
am
a
member
of
any
organization
that
now
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government,”
and
then
further
goes
on
to
the
attorney
general's
list.
mr.
francis
hoague
this
is
correct,
this
is
correct.
and
certainly,
scienter
would
be
more
--
more
simple
as
to
the
attorney
general's
list
because
the
list
could
be
obtained
at
least
whereas
when
it's
left
in
its
general
form,
it
puts
a
very
difficult
--
in
certain
cases
a,
an
impossible
burden
on
the
person
to
know
whether
they
have
a
revolutionary
purpose.
mr.
francis
hoague
right.
mr.
francis
hoague
that
--
that
is
correct.
but
that
is
not
the
only
--
that
is
not
the
complete
holding.
the
--
the
complete
holding
applied
to
more
than
just
the
attorney
general's
list.
it
applied
to
--
it
said
that
there
had
to
a
be
a
knowledge
of
the
revolutionary
--
revolutionary
purpose
of
the
organization.
now,
we
submit
that
the
--
well,
i
--
i
will
get
a
little
later
to
the
scienter
problem.
nevertheless,
the
reason
is
--
reasoning
of
this
is
that
a
person
might
be
very
innocently
a
member
of
an
organization.
we
submit
here
that
a
person
even
knowing
of
that
an
organization
has
a
revolutionary
purpose,
he
can
be
an
innocent
member.
this
statute
is
not
confined
to
active
membership
or
to
membership
for
the
purpose
--
for
the
revolutionary
purposes.
it's
very
possible
for
a
person
to
be
a
member
of
an
organization
which
is
masterminded
by
revolutionaries
which
engages
in
no
revolutionary
activity
actually
and
devotes
itself
to
other
purposes.
i
--
i
just
suggest
that
a
person
in
the
state
of
washington
who
was
devoted
to
old
age
--
to
advancing
the
cost
of
old
age
pensions,
might
very
well
belong
to
the
washington
pension
union.
there
is
no
other
organization
out
there
that
works
on
old
--
works
to
favor
old
age
pensions,
and
yet,
this
would
have
--
have
no
revolutionary
import
belonging
to
this
--
this
organization
which
has
been
declared
a
subversive
organization
by
the
subversive
activities
control
board.
mr.
francis
hoague
and
that
comes
right
back
to
the
same
thing,
a
subversive
person
is
a
person
who
either
intends
or
teaches
or
advocates
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
or
is
a
member
of
an
organization
or
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
so
that
--
that
really
doesn't
--
mr.
francis
hoague
by
--
by
statutory
definition.
that
doesn't
add
a
great
deal.
it
--
mr.
francis
hoague
right
on
the
last
page
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
in
appendix
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
sir,
i
have
it
here.
appendix
c,
in
page
9,
your
honor.
now,
the
--
mr.
francis
hoague
this
--
no.
this
is
the
one
that
was
presented
to
the
university
professors.
i
have
to
go
out
of
the
record
to
discuss
what
the
--
the
--
state
that
there
are
other
oaths
--
other
forms
of
oaths
that
were
presented
to
other
types
of
employees
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
francis
hoague
it
was
--
i
--
i
believe
it
was
left
up
--
actually
the
oaths
were
drawn
up
by
the
attorney
general
and
send
out.
again,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
of
that,
but
that
--
that's
my
impression,
and
that
again
is
not
on
the
record.
mr.
francis
hoague
the
--
yes.
on
the
communist
party,
on
--
on
subversive
organizations
other
than
the
communist
party,
knowledge
of
the
subversive
purpose
is
--
is
specifically
required
by
statute
and
that
is
--
mr.
francis
hoague
and
that
appears
in
the
definition
of
subversive
person.
mr.
francis
hoague
and
that
is
on
page
2
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
section
5.
a
subversive
person
means
any
person,
and
i
will
jump
to
where
it
says
section
--
no.
section
--
i'm
wrong
on
this
--
mr.
francis
hoague
section
3.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
but
there
is
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
no.
i
am
under
the
impression
that
the
1953
act
provided
as
to
--
yes.
in
the
1953
act,
i'm
sure,
provided
as
to
this
oath
that
as
to
all
--
all
subversive
organizations
other
than
the
communist
party
was
not
named
specifically
in
--
at
that
time
as
a
subversive
organization.
that
scienter
was
required,
and
i'll
read
this
from
the
--
mr.
francis
hoague
thank
you.
on
page
64
of
the
appellees'
brief,
starting
at
the
bottom
of
section
5,
and
that's
--
yes.
this
is
the
1953
amendment.
and
it
says,
“subversive
person
means
any
person
who
commits,”
and
so
forth,
“or
who
with
knowledge
that
the
organization
is
an
organization
as
described
in
paragraphs
(2)
or
(3)
becomes
or
remains
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization
or
foreign,”
and
so
on,
“subversive
organization”.
so
that
as
to
all
subversive
organizations
other
than
the
communist
party
scienter
is
required.
as
to
the
communist
party
in
1955,
section
4
says
that,
“membership
in
the
communist
party
is
a
subversive
activity.”
and
this
did
a
way
with
scienter
vis-à-vis
the
communist
party.
mr.
francis
hoague
the
oath
--
mr.
francis
hoague
nothing
in
the
oath,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
the
supreme
court
said
that
they
implied
scienter
in
every
portion
of
the
oath
and
of
the
statute.
mr.
francis
hoague
they
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
it
is
not
--
it
does
not
read.
there's
nothing
in
the
--
yes.
it
--
it
does
not
state
knowingly
in
the
oath.
it
does
by
reference
to
the
statute.
mr.
francis
hoague
if
he
knows
the
law.
mr.
francis
hoague
if
he
knows
the
law
or
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
well,
i'll
argue
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
it
right
now,
mr.
--
mr.
francis
hoague
all
right.
mr.
francis
hoague
the
--
the
supreme
court
has
not
held
that
it's
a
requisite.
they
say
that
it
is
implied
in
every
part
of
the
oath
in
the
statute.
and
then
they
go
on
to
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
--
i'm
not
too
sure
what
it
does
mean,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
really
not.
it
--
i
think
it
means
that
except
as
to
the
communist
party,
he
cannot
be
discharged
for
belonging
to
a
subversive
organization
unless
he
knows
of
the
subversive
purpose
of
the
organization.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
not
--
excuse
me.
no,
it
is
not,
mr.
justice
black.
it
--
but
--
mr.
francis
hoague
we
will
concede
that
except
as
to
the
communist
party.and
as
to
the
communist
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
and
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
than
the
oath
shows,
your
honor,
i
am
conceding
more.
mr.
francis
hoague
this
--
this
is
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
this
is
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
there's
no
question
about
that.
that's
--
that's
correct.
i
--
we
--
we
decided
to
handle
this
on
the
assumption
that
the
statute
was
incorporated
into
the
oath
and
that
everybody
is
presumed
to
know
the
law
because
we
still
think
that's
it's
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
honor.
the
opinion
in
the
court
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
francis
hoague
in
this
very
case,
except
as
to
the
communist
party.
mr.
francis
hoague
and
as
to
the
communist
party,
scienter
isn't
required
because
the
court
says
it
is
common
knowledge
that
the
communist
party
is
a
subversive
organization.
mr.
francis
hoague
if
i'm
correct,
that
it's
the
attorney
general
who
wrote
the
oath.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
former
attorney
general.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
the
appellees
equate
and
the
court
below
equate
their
failure
to
sign
the
loyalty
oath
with
disloyalty
and
unfitness,
and
this
is
the
error
that
we
submit
they
fall
in
to,
because
it
is
not
a
true
equation,
it
is
only
grounds
for
suspicion.
and
in
the
absence
of
hearings
or
some
sort
of
inquiry
to
show
that
the
suspicious
are
well
founded,
there
is
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
i
want
to
quickly
refer
to
two
cases
that
superficially
might
be
considered
applicable
but
we
submit
are
different.
one
is
the
gerende
case,
gerende
against
the
board
of
election
supervisors.
in
the
first
place,
gerende
was
a
candidate,
was
not
an
office
holder
and
with
the
thought
of
the
nelson
case
as
applied
to
mr.
globe,
the
appellant
globe
or
petitioner,
it
appears
that
a
person
who
is
an
applicant
for
a
job
and
here
a
--
a
candidate
for
office
is
more
remote
from
the
property
concept,
i
suppose,
of
the
due
process
clause.
furthermore,
in
the
gerende
case,
the
briefs
and
the
court
below
made
no
reference
to
procedural
due
process.
this
was
not
presented
to
this
court
in
that
--
as
far
as
the
briefs
are
concerned
and
since
--
mr.
francis
hoague
gerende.
and
since
it
was
per
curiam
opinion,
i
--
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
considered
by
the
court.
but
it
--
it
at
least
was
not
argued.
the
other
is
american
communications
association
against
douds.
and
there
are
number
of
grounds
for
distinguishing
this
case.
i
think
the
most
important
is
that
the
separation
from
the
employment
there
was
indirect
rather
than
direct.
a
union
official
who
did
not
take
the
oath
wasn't
fired
from
his
job,
it
merely
--
some
pressure
was
put
or
--
or
some
benefits
were
taken
away
from
the
union.
and
this
would
might
normally
have
the
result
of
his
losing
his
job
but
the
law
did
not
remove
him
from
office.
mr.
francis
hoague
the
statute,
of
course,
says
shall
because
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
immediate
dismissal
which
does
not
imply
a
hearing.
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
opinion
is
most
unsatisfactorily
in
a
great
many
respects
and
not
only
--
but
--
this
respect,
but
there
is
--
this
is
the
only
holding
with
regard
to
this
portion
of
the
statute.
so
there
is
nothing
in
--
to
show
it
except
this
plain
wording
of
it,
and
the
fact
that
the
appellees
have
not
made
any
such
claim.
i
think
that
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
they
have
that.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
they
have.
and
they
--
they
have
not
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
it's
all
done.
mr.
francis
hoague
they
--
demand
has
been
made
upon
them
to
sign
the
oath
and
they
were
told
that
they
--
they
refused
that
they
would
be
fired.
they
did
not
refuse.
they
brought
a
declaratory
judgement,
a
petition
for
declaratory
judgment,
i
was
wrong.
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
this
is
in
--
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
this
is
in
the
findings
of
fact,
page
9
of
the
printed
record,
paragraph
(6)
pursuant
to
the
act,
“defendants
have
demanded
that
the
plaintiff
sign,
swear
and
oath,”
and
i'm
skipping,
“i
have
stated
that
unless
the
plaintiff
comply
with
such
demands
their
employment
contracts
with
the
university
would
be
terminated
by
the
defendants.”
mr.
francis
hoague
the
--
no,
but
this
is
defined.
this
is
the
basis
of
--
mr.
francis
hoague
these
are
the
findings
of
facts
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
and
actually,
in
the
record,
if
you
want
to
find
the
exact
notice
that
was
sent
out,
it
is
in
the
unprinted
record.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
francis
hoague
not
in
the
printed
record.
in
the
unprinted
record,
the
notice
that
went
out
is
in
the
request
--
request
for
admissions
of
fact,
pages
16
to
26
in
the
original
record,
and
that
shows
the
letter
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes
your
honor,
yes.
i
--
i
state
at
pages
16
to
27
is
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that
shows
the
letter
that
went
out
from
the
university
to
the
defendants.
but
we
don't
--
to
--
to
the
appellants,
we
don't
believe
that
it
is
necessary,
actually,
to
do
that
--
to
go
to
that
portion
of
the
unprinted
record
because
the
findings
of
fact
which
are
final,
which
are
not
challenged,
state
that
the
defendants
or
there,
the
appellees
here
have
stated
that
unless
the
plaintiffs
comply
with
their
demands,
their
employment
contracts
with
the
university
would
be
terminated
by
the
defendants.
and
that
--
that
is
certainly
can't
be
challenged
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
hoague
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
this
is
--
this
is
the
--
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
--
a
reason
in
and
out
itself
why
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
francis
hoague
this
is
claimed
by
the
appellees.
we
contradict.
we
are
actually,
your
honor,
at
a
lost
to
understand
it.
i
would
like
to
wait
until
he
explains
it
a
little
more
here
in
--
in
reply
and
rebuttal.
now,
with
the
court's
leave,
mr.
ringold
--
