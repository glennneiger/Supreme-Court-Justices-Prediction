justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
those
--
would
--
before
the
supreme
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state
supreme
court
with
the
federal
constitutional
questions
that
were
argued
different
from
those
that
you
had
raised
in
your
petition
before
the
trial
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
are
identical,
were
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
--
was
there
a
brief
submitted
to
the
trial
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
also
requires
an
affirmation
that
one
is
not
both
a
subversive
person.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
isn't
brought
by
--
by
statutory
definition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
case
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
they
get
notice
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
--
where
is
the
notice
that
they
received
in
the
records?
did
it
say
they
would
be
discharged
with
--
without
hearing
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
at
all
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
deny
that
that
was
performed
for
the
notice
given?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
we
have
findings
of
facts.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
the
record
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
filed
with
our
clerk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
it
can't
be
challenged
so
that
means
it
would
be
terminated
without
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
says,
“would
be
terminated”.
you're
reading
into
that
would
be
terminated
without
hearing,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fuller,
may
i
ask
you?
i've
been
going
through
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
original
record
and
i
can't
find
that
any
of
these
pages
that
your
adversary
referred
to
the
copy
of
any
notice
to
--
either
of
these
petitioners
from
anybody
telling
in
if
he
didn't
sign,
he'd
be
--
the
complaint
will
be
terminated.was
there
such
notice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
didn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
they
allege
that
there
had
been
such
a
notice.
wasn't
that
the
basis
so
far
which
they
secured
the
interim
restraint
against
their
termination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
appeal
where?
in
the
supreme
court
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
fuller,
i
notice
in
the
brief
that
i
had
here
that
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court,
“on
behalf
of
these
petitioners,”
set
at
page
13
of
that
brief,
“who'd
be
observed
under
section
15,
chapter
254,
laws
of
1951,
the
employee
may
be
discharged
at
reasonable
grounds
excitably
if
the
person
is
subversive
after
notice
of
charges
and
hearing.
the
amendatory
language
of
the
laws
of
1955
may
confuse
when
they
sign
the
oath
for
the
answer
of
the
question,
grounds
for
mandatory
discharge
and
denial
of
a
permit
without
regard
to
whether
the
person
is
in
fact
subversive
and
without
any
notice
of
charges
or
hearing.”
this
is
in
their
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
13
of
their
--
so
it
is
in
this
record,
i
believe.
so
this
--
this
seems
to
be
that
they
raise
the
question
that
while
the
1951
statute
originally
required
a
hearing
the
1955
amendment
repealed
that
required
and
now
makes
discharge
mandatory
without
regard
to
whether
the
person
is
in
fact
subversive
and
without
any
notice
of
charge
or
a
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
difference
between
your
1951
and
1955
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
refer
to
section
15
of
your
1951
statute.
have
you
reproduced
that
anywhere
or
is
it
anywhere
in
this
--
in
any
of
these
briefs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
your
brief?
this
is
the
1951,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
--
in
the
supreme
court
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
all
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
find
here
you
have
(inaudible)2
brief
in
your
supreme
court
but
i
don't
see
any
brief
reviews
here
in
this
--
in
this
unprinted
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
just
ask
you
this,
mr.
fuller?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
--
the
professors
won
in
your
trial
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
state
or
the
agencies
of
the
state
took
the
appeal
to
your
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
it
your
practice
in
the
state
of
washington
that
they
may
defend
their
judgment
below
on
any
ground
available
to
them
whether
or
not
they
successfully
contest
the
point
you
raised
on
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
didn't
they,
in
this
brief,
then
attempt
to
defend
the
judgment
below
on
this
--
at
the
hearing
point
in
that
section,
that
page
i
read
to
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
look
at
page
13,
look
at
the
argument
at
page
13
that
i've
read
before,
that
this
is
this
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
bottom
of
page
13.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fuller,
is
--
is
the
section
2
of
the
1955
act
at
page
67?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what's
this
one
at,
this
is
your
brief,
at
page
67,
what's
that
section
2?
this
section
amended
by
this
section
2.
it
has
the
last
sentence
in
it,
“any
person
failing
to
execute
such
a
statement
shall
immediately
discharged”?
do
you
notice
that
at
the
end
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
sentence
still
part
of
the
laws
now
in
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
page
67
of
your
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

and
it's
the
last
sentence
of
that
section
which
appears
at
page
67.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
would
that
include
these
propositions?

(voice

brief,
mr.
fuller.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
fuller,
section
15
deals
with
a
person
charged
with
being
a
subversive
person.
there's
nothing
to
do,
does
it,
with
the
person
who
refuses
to
take
--
sign
the
oath?
aren't
they
two
very
different
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
