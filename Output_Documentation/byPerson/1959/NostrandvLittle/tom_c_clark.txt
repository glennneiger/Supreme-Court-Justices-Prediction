oh,
that
would
be
a

justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
that
would
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
in
the
organization
to
whom
--
which
he
belongs
on
the
list
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
and
it
didn't
take
that
into
accounts.
i
remember
i
read
the
case
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
you
attack
it
because
of
lack
of
a
hearing?
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
your
court
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
didn't
alleged
notice,
did
they?
and
you
said
and
done
--
have
demanded
that
plaintiff's
son
swore
to
an
oath,
than
they
have
(inaudible)
and
unless
plaintiffs
comply
with
what
demands
and
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
(voice
overlap)
if
they
threatened
with
termination,
they
just,
i
guess,
conclusion
and
they
would
be
terminated
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
if
they
didn't
sign
the
oath.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
never
amended
any
hearing.
yes,
that
could
be.
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
have
a
civil
service
act
that
require
the
hearing
before
they
can
be
discharged,
the
general
citizens?
justice
tom
c.
clark
your
court
didn't
pass
on
the
hearing,
isn't
it,
your
supreme
court?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
your
supreme
court
did
not
pass
on
the
hearing,
did
you?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
the
charge
shall
be
caused
by
immediate.
it
didn't
say
“immediate”.
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
they
allege
they
were
employed?
they
attack
1955
act,
is
it
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
the
other
section
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
if
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
your
contention
was
that
the
1951
act
provides
for
a
hearing.
it
was
still
in
effect
and
that
the
1955
act
would
afford
a
hearing.
the
1955
act
did
not
amend
the
--
i
mean
did
not
repeal
the
hearing
provisions
of
the
1951
act.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
the
attorney
general
or
you
think
that
the
--
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing,
i
believe,
you
said
a
few
minutes
ago?
