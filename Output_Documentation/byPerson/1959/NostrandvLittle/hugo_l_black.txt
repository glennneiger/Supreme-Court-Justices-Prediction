there

that's
not

it

you're
conceding
more
than

but
it
puts
on
him
the
responsibility,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
assume
we
have
to
handle
it
each
one
of
us
for
ourselves,
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
oath
that
he
is
required
to
sign
is
constitutional
without
that
regard
that
what
you
think
might
happen
later
by
your
court
if
they
prosecute
him
on
a
charge.
justice

well,
who
wrote
up

the

well,
i
--
justice

--
i
assume
that
we
would
have
to
assume
that
he
also
knows
what
the

decided.but
the
oath
that
he
wrote
and
to
which
he
--
which
is
on
trial
before
us
does
not
contain
any
statement

you

a

did
--
was

that
way

--
justice

(voice

--
justice
hugo

well,
was
it
--
was
it
treated
as
a
charge
to
the
act
as
applied
to
this
--
supposed
to
be
applied
to
this
people
who
violate
the
constitution?
we
don't
use
to
take
it
up
on
the
whole
statute
unless
we
have
here.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
entitled
to
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
they
are
entitled
to
any,
where
does
the
act
show
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
did
reproduce
it
on
page
67
of
our
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
how
your
facts
were
found
by
the
judge
but
in
section
6
of
the
complaint
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
was
alleged
that
they
had
--
and
demanded
as
they
sign
and
swear
to
an
oath,
the
copy
which
is
exhibit
a
unless
they
comply
with
the
demands
and
form
a
contract
with
the
university
will
be
terminated
by
the
defendant.
and
your
answer,
you
denied
this.
i'm
(inaudible)
the
court
found,
however,
that
pursuant
to
the
act,
defendants
have
demanded
that
plaintiff
sign
and
swear
to
an
oath.
the
copy
of
which
is
attached
to
the
complaint
therein,
exhibit
a,
and
have
stated
that
unless
the
plaintiffs
complied
with
such
demand,
their
employment
contract
with
the
university
would
be
terminated
by
the
defendant.
now,
i'd
suppose
the
state
of
washington
had
intended
at
that
time,
say
that
they
would
not
be
terminated
but
they'd
wait
for
a
year
and
somebody
would
have
said
it.
the
courts
found
that
they
have
given
limited
term
with
the
notice
that
unless
they
signed
it,
they
would
be
--
employment
would
be
terminated.
are
you
construing
that
as
being
anything
less
than
what
it
seems
to
mean
on
its
face?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
they
overturn
this
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
so,
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
hypothetical,
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
they
had
been
delivered
a
notice
and
said
if
they
didn't
sign
it,
they
would
be
fired.
you
denied
in
your
answer.
the
district
court
found
they
did,
but
that
was
a
fact
they
have
done
it.
now,
unless
the
supreme
court
has
overturned
that,
are
you
challenging
the
accuracy
of
that
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
but
there's
nothing
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
about
a
hearing.
the
--
the
alligation
was
that
they
were
told,
if
they
didn't
sign
this,
they
--
employment
would
be
terminated
and
i
think
you'd
want
to
tie
this
on
the
issue
of
the
phrase
that
the
--
it
would
be
terminated,
and
number
6,
if
you
denied
it,
the
court
found
that
that
was
a
fact.
they'd
been
told,
if
they
didn't
sign,
it
would
be
terminated.
now,
what
reason
have
you
no
to
say
that's
not
correct?
i
can
--
are
you
challenging
it
on
the
ground
that
it's
based
on
no
evidence?
if
so,
when
did
you
first
challenged
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
why
is
it
not
squarely
before
that?
they
--
they
allege
it,
and
you
deny
it
and
the
court
find
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
isn't
it
squarely
raised
for
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you're
asking
us,
as
i
gather
it,
the
whole
that
the
court
didn't
consider
this
although
it's
been
decided
in
the
court
below
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
--
did
you
make
any
assignment
of
errors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
make
any
assignments
of
errors
and
where
are
they?
and
did
you
assign
as
an
error
the
fact
that
the
court
had
made
a
--
the
finding
was
not
supported
by
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
appellant
takes
the
case,
is
it
his
duty
to
show
that
the
judgment
is
bad
or
that
the
other
men's
duty
affirmative
to
show
that
the
judgment
is
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
a
case
goes
up
and
facts
are
found,
and
if
appellant
wishes
to
challenge
those
--
that
finding
of
facts,
whose
duty
is
it
to
do
that?
the
appellant
or
the
appellee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
duty
was
it
to
attack
the
finding
6
if
it
was
bad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
also
take
out
of
the
other
act,
all
the
provisions
for
rehearings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
--
did
the
1953
act
eliminate
provisions
for
rehearing
that
had
previously
existed
in
the
other
acts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
just
want
to
know
if
the
new
amendment
eliminates
the
provisions
in
the
prior
act
which
had
authorize
--
which
had
required
a
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
do
about
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
take
out
any
part
of
the
language
of
the
prior
act
that
had
authorized
the
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
amendment
again
after
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
changes
did
it
make?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
prior
act
contain
that
provision
required
immediate
termination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
rehab
this
language
to
require
immediate
termination
whatever
effect
it
required?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
it.
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
1953?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
these
--
i
gather
that
these
two
men
if
they
--
are
sensitive
employers
because
they
teach
history
and
romance
and
language,
is
that
what
they
teach?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
allege
that
either.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
--
are
those
considered
sensitive
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
by
why?
he
--
this
doesn't
say
that
he
will
not
belong
to
oath
that
they
gave
him,
it
doesn't
say
that
he
will
not
belong
to
an
organization
which
he
knows
to
be
subversive
that
he
does
not.
it
says
he
does
not
belong
to
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
--
when
has
it
been
held
by
your
court
that
a
man
is
not
responsible
for
--
for
it
on
the
basis
you
suggest?
i'm
talking
about
a
holding
of
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
has
been
none.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
man
has
to
sign
his
oath
as
against
whether
he
--
what
will
happen
to
him
if
he
belongs
to
one
if
they
may
later
turn
out
on
the
evidence
to
be
subversive
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
did
it
hold
that
in
the
case?
which
case
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
that
it
holds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
that
was
a
holding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
a
holding
that
these
particular
people
had
to
sign
this
oath
and
they
would
know
that
they
would
not
be
held
liable
if
they
were
innocent
of
the
purposes
of
the
organization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
penalty
in
that
case,
the
lovett
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
penalty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
penalty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
language
would
have
provided
that
you
lose
your
job,
that
it'd
just
be
loose
language
but
(inaudible)
you'd
lose
your
job.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
see,
we
frequently
hear
that
the
dissent
is
not
the
opinion
and
the
--
the
majority
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
that
was
considered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
about
the
gerende
case.
of
--
one
of
the
sentences
in
this
case
was
this,
and
i
ask
what
you
think
it
meant.
we
read
this
decision
the
whole
that
to
obtain
a
place
on
maryland
ballot,
a
candidate
need
only
make
oath
that
he
is
not
a
person
who
is
engaged
in,
in
one
way
or
another,
in
the
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence,
and
that
he
is
not
knowing
a
member
of
an
organization
engaged
in
such
attempt.
what
do
you
understand
that
in
engaged
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
your
(e)
goes
a
little
further
than
that.
it
may
not
be
important,
but
the
court
read
that
as
only
putting
the
penalty
on
actually
engaging
in
or
belonging
to
an
organization
that
was
actually
engaging
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
i'm
just
saying
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
be
read
as
meaning
more
than
and
i
think
it
mean
i
agree
to
it
and
that
--
that
sentence
is
very
important
in
considering
that
particular
case.
i
do
not
mean
to
say
if
you
do
not
have
other
cases
that
would
support
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
(voice

--
justice

--
axe
or
gun.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
this
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
does
this
opinion
indicate
that
would
base
on
any
extent
on
earth
on
that
--
that
idea?do
you
get
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
from
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
get
from
the
idea
that
a
man
actually
engaged
in
doing
something,
engaging
in
an
effort
at
the
moment
to
overthrow
the
government,
does
that
refer
to
speech
or
writings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
stated
to
you
that
there
were
cases
that
might
support
it,
but
this
one
is
limited
to
actually
engaging
in
the
conduct
not
the
speaking
or
the
writing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
say
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
would
say
it's
engaged
in
something
it's
in
free
speech
and
free
press,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
didn't
you
argue
that
in
the
beginning
if
that's
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
been
argued
--
it's
been
argued
here
back
and
forth
or
(inaudible)
are
you
saying
now
that
your
law
gives
these
people
a
chance
to
adhere
in
this
section
they
cannot
be
immediately
discharged
as
the
court
found
but
because
it
would
violate
this
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
--
has
it
been
so
interpreted
with
reference
to
college
professors
or
had
you
ever
argued
it
in
this
case
up
to
this
moment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
--
had
you
ever
argued
it
in
this
case
up
to
this
moment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
did
say
to
reverse
judgment,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
did
so
on
--
despite
the
fact
that
the
there
was
a
finding
they
had
been
told,
they'd
be
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
that
in
your
(inaudible)
representing
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
washington,
that
you
believe
that
these
people
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
any
statute
that
now
exist
if
they
do
not
sign
this,
and
if
so,
where
is
that
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
well
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
are
guessing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
they
refused
to
sign
that
oath,
they
can
get
a
