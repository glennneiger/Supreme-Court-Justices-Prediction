mr.
solie
m.
ringold
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
--
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
remaining,
i
must(inaudible)my
argument
considerably.
the
argument
with
respect
to
bill
of
attainder
and
with
respect
to
the
freedoms
under
the
first
amendment,
it
had
been
stated
much
more
eloquently
than
i
could
state
them
by
your
honors
in
the
various
cases.
i
think,
however,
that
there
are
one
or
two
implications
in
each
of
these
matters,
which
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
bill
of
attainder,
if
this
court
will
not
reexamine
the
basis
of
douds,
we
must
confess
the
bill
of
attainder
argument
goes
out
the
window.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
bill
of
attainder
argument
which
would
dispose
of
in
douds
was
disposed
of
upon
an
erroneous
basis.
if
we
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
proscription
of
the
communist
party
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
becomes
quite
apparent
that
the
purpose
is
to
punish
that
which
we
cannot
otherwise
be
constitutionally
punished.
its
purpose
is
to
discourage
ideas,
to
discourage
associations.
there
is
no
real
rational
relationship
to
fitness
of
the
individual
who
may
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
it
is
an
inference
drawn
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
he
is
a
fortiori
unfit
to
teach
in
the
universities.
now,
the
--
as
i
read
douds,
it
seems
to
say
that
the
oath
requirement
in
douds
would
have
been
considered
a
bill
of
attainder
except
for
the
fact
that
it
had
present
and
prospective
application
only.
and
therefore,
it
should
not
be
deemed
a
bill
of
attainder.
we
submit
that
the
constitutional
provision
prohibiting
bills
of
attainder
and
ex
post
facto
laws
being
in
the
disjunctive
intended
to
exclude
two
separate
categories
of
laws
which
the
founders
of
the
constitution
deem
to
be
improper.
there
were
at
least
three
historic
examples
of
bills
of
attainder
which
were
prospective
in
application
which
were
before
the
constitutional
convention,
these
matters
are
cited
in
our
brief.
and
undoubtedly,
there
must
have
been
a
reason
for
including
the
bill
of
attainder
along
with
the
ex
post
facto
provision
in
our
constitution.
it
--
i
think
it's
significant
that
there
was
no
discussion
at
all
in
the
constitutional
convention
with
respect
to
the
acceptance
of
the
prohibition
against
a
bill
of
attainder.
there
was
some
discussion
about
the
inclusion
of
the
prohibition
against
ex
post
facto
laws.
and
there
was
some
colloquy
where
it
was
said,
there
is
no
reason
to
include
ex
post
facto
laws
because
every
lawyer,
every
civilian
knows
obviously
those
are
illegal
and
unlawful.
but
bills
of
attainder
were
not
deemed
to
be
unlawful.
they
were
passed
by
the
georgia
legislature,
they
have
been
passed
by
pennsylvania
legislature,
and
they
have
been
passed
by
the
new
york
legislature.
we
found
though
that
there
were
bills
of
attainder
which
were
--
which
were
prospective.
and
i
think
that
the
greatest
example
of
that
was
the
great
bill
of
attainder
act
was
passed
by
the
dublin
parliament
under
james
ii.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
and
the
freedoms
guaranteed
thereunder,
it
is
our
position
that
the
language
in
adler
has
been
tempered
by
your
honors'
holding
in
the
sweezy
case.
and
this,
i
think,
is
as
it
should
be.
i
think
that
we
must
consider
the
necessity
for
controversy.
we
must
consider
the
necessity
for
decent
at
a
university
when
it
is
unrelated
to
the
fitness
of
the
individual
teacher.
the
clear
and
present
danger,
i
assume,
that
we
are
talking
about
which
the
legislature
may
--
may
legislate
against
is
that
of
having
incompetent
teachers.
now,
let
us
assume
this
example.
let
us
assume
we
have
a
perfectly
competent
teacher
at
a
university,
and
he
comes
to
the
regions
of
the
university,
and
he
said,
“gentlemen,
i
have
become
a
neo-fascist.
i
believe
that
we
should
engage
in
a
change
in
our
constitutional
form
of
government
so
that
we
have
a
neo-fascist
dictatorship
in
this
country.
i
am
not
going
to
do
anything
about
this
in
my
classroom.
i
intend
to
devote,
however,
my
free
time
outside
of
the
classroom
to
my
political
activity
in
this
party.”
now,
to
me,
there
is
very
little
difference,
very
little
distinction
between
that
and,
for
example,
the
teacher
who
may
be
a
member
of
the
naacp.
the
question
must
be
what
relationship
--
what
danger
is
there
to
his
views
and
beliefs
being
injected
into
his
teaching,
into
his
competency
as
a
teacher.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
i
believe,
your
honor,
it's
so
held,
yes.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
the
only
--
the
only
determination,
and
this,
of
course,
brings
us
back,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
the
bill
of
attainder
argument.
the
only
determination
that
has
ever
been
made
that
the
communist
party
seeks
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
is
the
determination
that
has
been
made
by
the
various
legislatures
just
as
an
example
of
that.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
yes.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
except
--
should
not,
your
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
should
not
the
guilt
be
that
of
the
individual
not
derived
at
by
virtue
of
his
association.
if
this
individual
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
he
individually
subscribes
to
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
i
have
no
quarrel,
sir.
but
it
must
be
individual.
and
it
occurs
to
me,
it
occurs
to
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
that
is
my
position,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
perhaps
your
honor
himself
stated
this
in
the
douds
case
when
you
said,
your
honor,
that
the
cargo
article,
the
faith
of
our
civilization
is
the
inviolate
character
of
the
individual,
and
this,
i
firmly
believe.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
that
is
my
position.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
i'd
like
to
make
one
more
point
with
respect
to
that.
your
honor
now
is
assuming
that
the
communist
party
is
bad
and
therefore
any
membership
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
very
well.
now,
if
--
is
there
not
a
possibility,
is
there
not
a
possibility
that
the
character,
the
communist
party
will
change
and
it
will
revert
to
the
--
to
the
good
old
communist
party
of
earl
browder
before
the
duclos
letter
as
mr.
browder
referred
to
in
the
harper,
a
month
or
so
ago.
now,
if
this
is
the
case,
and
this
is
conceivable,
the
statute
and
the
oath
proscribe
membership
in
the
communist
party,
but
is
this
not
a
prior
restraint
upon
association
because
until
such
time
as
the
legislature
has
concluded
that
the
communist
party
has
changed
it's
purpose
or
is
now
a
lawful
organization
and
has
become
the
browder
party
rather
than
the
foster
party.
until
such
time,
one
is
taking
a
risk
under
our
statute
and
under
our
oath
of
associating
with
that
party.
thank
you.
i'll
reserve
my
few
moments
left.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
in
response
to
a
question
concerning
the
necessity
or
the
right
to
a
hearing,
it
was
our
opinion
that
this
statute
in
this
particular
situation
deprived
the
plaintiffs
of
a
hearing.
for
that
reason,
at
its
inception,
our
complaint
was
drawn
on
that
basis
and
paragraph
5
of
our
complaint
as
it
appears
on
page
2
of
the
printed
record,
upon
they
did
execute
such
oath,
his
employment
be
terminated.
thereupon,
there
was
a
denial
by
the
state.
request
for
admissions
were
made
which
admitted
that
the
statute
would
be
construed
in
that
fashion
to
deny
a
hearing.
the
findings
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law,
conclusion,
finding
of
fact
number
6
was
then
included.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
request
for
admission
were
made
and
in
--
and
the
findings
of
fact
were
based
upon
the
answers
to
the
requests
for
admissions.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
yes.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
i
said
their
answers,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
--
to
our
request
for
admissions,
indicated
that
a
hearing
would
not
be
granted.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
i
do
not
believe
that
is
in
the
printed
record.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
i
would
have
to
go
through
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
two
or
five.
in
any
event
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
in
any
event
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
this
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
the
question
i
assume,
mr.
chief
justice,
depended
upon
whether
or
not
a
review
by
implication
took
place
or
not.
this
was
why
we
interpreted
as
a
review
by
implication
having
taken
place
by
virtue
of
the
1955
act.
and
again,
that
was
why
we
framed
the
complaint
originally
to
specifically
raise
the
question.
and
this
matter
was
argued
in
the
lower
court,
it
was
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
we
of
course
extensively
argued
it
with
respect
to
the
attorney
general's
list.
we
did
raise
the
question
with
respect
to
a
--
we
--
we
cited
slochower
and
those
other
matters.
then
when
the
original
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
came
down,
the
focal
point
then,
it
became
much
more
pointed
as
to
whether
or
not
the
hearing
issue
was
raised.
and
in
our
petition
for
rehearing,
pages
41
to
45
of
the
unprinted
record,
we
specifically
raise
the
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
yes,
your
honor.
the
wyman
case
clearly
establish
that
public
employment
was
not
a
privilege
which
could
be
denied
for
any
reason
whatsoever.
the
united
states
supreme
court's
unanimous
holding
was
that
eligibility
for
public
employment
can
only
be
conditioned
on
requirements
which
had
a
reasonable
relation
to
fitness.
the
importance
of
this
aspect
of
our
argument
was
totally
overlooked
by
this
court
in
its
failure
to
mention
and
apply
the
doctrine
of
swayze,
schwer,
canniburgh,
slochower.
it
is
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
i
am
reading
from
the
unprinted
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
this
is
our
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
yes,
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
yes.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
it
is
no
answer
to
say
learner
dylan
and
adler.
each
of
these
cases
involved
hearings
to
determine
the
fitness
of
the
employee
for
employment
under
the
state's
right
to
investigate
the
qualifications
of
the
employees.
and
then
we
underlined.
"there
is
not
one
case
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
which
holds
that
the
state
may
discharge
an
employee
solely
upon
refusal
to
subscribe
to
an
oath
that
he
is
not
a
subversive
person."

court

in
slochower
versus
board
or

--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
the
heading
under
which
it
appeared
is
under
due
process
that
scienter
is
a
necessary
element
in
oaths
of
nonmembership
in
proscribed
organizations.
we
then
cited
slochower.
the
plaintiff
claimed
this
privilege,
we
quoted
mr.
justice
clark,
then
we
said
the
court
discusses
adler
garner
and
then
says,
“but
in
each
of
these
cases,
it
was
emphasized
that
the
state
must
conform
to
the
requirements
of
due
process.
the
summary
dismissal
of
appellant
violates
due
process
of
law.”
this
is
emphasized,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
i
--
well,
we
certainly
felt
it
was.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
we
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
well
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
was
one
of
them,
and
in
their
--
i
think
there
were
others
and
i
don't
have
them
before
me
now.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
my
recollection
was
that
after
the
admissions
were
made,
an
argument
was
had
before
the
trial
court,
i
prepared
the
findings
of
fact
and
the
conclusions
of
law
and
they
were
presented
to
the
attorney
general's
office.
they
incorporated
finding
number
6,
they
were
approved
and
in
--
in
accordance
with
the
original
complaint
which
initiated
the
action.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
there
were.
we
presented
a
written
brief
and
the
state's
attorney
general
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
they
are
not,
you
honor.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
i
believe
they
are.
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
yes.
the
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
the
state's
brief
in
the
state
supreme
court
only
argued
the
state
constitutional
issues,
did
not
argue
the
federal
constitutional
issues
which
had
been
raised.
they
were
the
appellants
--
mr.
solie
m.
ringold
we'll
do
so,
mr.
justice
brennan.
may
i
just
mention,
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss,
i
think
that
we
discussed
that.
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
made
upon
this
precise
ground.
mr.
solie
m.

thank
you.
