justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
hasn't
your
supreme
court
interpreted
the
oath
as
including
the
element
of
scienter?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
court
decisions
in
--
are
the
court
decisions
in
washington
clear
that
a
man
who
refuses
to
sign
one
of
these
oaths
does
not
get
a
hearing?
i
didn't
see
anything
in
either
brief
or
in
the
court's
opinion
that
--
indicating
one
way
or
another
whether
the
statute
had
been
interpreted
either
to
exclude
a
hearing
or
to
include.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
your
clients
have
actually
refused
to
take
the
oath,
the
officers
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
have
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
they
were
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
so
that
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
they
have
--
they
have
not
refused.does
the
record
shows
they
have
refused
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
didn't
raise
that
point
below.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
there
been
numerous
decisions
of
your
court
construing
this
1950
act
or
is
this
the
first
one
or
have
there
been
any
decision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
premise
that
the
act
does
not
accord
a
hearing,
the
one
who
refuses
to
sign
an
affidavit
is
not
a
knowing
member
of
the
communist
party.
assuming
that's
that
premise,
what's
your
position
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
in
that
basis?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
