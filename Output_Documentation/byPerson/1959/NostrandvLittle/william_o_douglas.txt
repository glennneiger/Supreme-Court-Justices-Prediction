where
that
appears?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
shows
what?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they're
in
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
notice
of
appeal
gives
it
on
page
51
to
53.
justice
william
o.

so
that
would
--
would
that
be
in
the
unprinted
record
that
is
here?
in
notice
of
appeal?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
this
point
we're
talking
about,
mr.
fuller,
is
every
provision
of
this
--
every
section
of
this
statute
that
i
read
has
in
it
a
phrase
or
clause
“shall
immediately
be
discharged”.
i
mean
there's
nothing
that
i
find
it
here
about
a
hearing,
“shall,
after
hearing,
be
discharged.”
this
is
all
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
we
show
“immediately
be
discharged”.
justice
william
o.
douglas
may
i
just
--
before
you
leave
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
let
me
say
that
again.
i
--
i
still
don't
understand
what
your
position
is.

well,
at
--
on
page
67
of
the
--
if
that
was
the
earlier
one,
was
it?
it
said,
“he
shall
immediately
be
discharged.”
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
in
relation
to
the
oath,
that
was
in
relation
to
the
execution
of
the
statement.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
the
1953
act,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
the
football
coach?
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
might
--
he
might
require
(inaudible)
to
make
sure
he
was
really
non-subversive.
