mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
so
what
did
you
say,
mr.
hoague,
about
the
exemption
some
of
them
are
not
required
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
does
that
refer
to
the
agency
for
which
a
particular
person
works?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
--
not
a
special
agency
to
set
up
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
all
employees
in
the
state
service.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.

chief

warren
67.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
might
he
not
fall
then
under
the
--
under
the
portion
of
the
act
which
says,
“i
am
not
a
subversive
person”?
is
there
question
of
whether
he
actually
belongs
or
not
determine
whether
he
is
subversive
person?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
am
i
wrong
that
your
--
your
statute
provides
that
whether
a
person
belongs
to
an
organization
or
not
if
he
--
if
he
does
advocate
force
and
violence
he's
a
subversive
person?
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
would
just
read
this
very
hastily,
and
i
don't
know
whether
--
whether
i
read
it
correctly
or
not,
but
i
thought
they
made
that
distinction
that
if
--
that
if
an
individual
did
advocate
force
and
violence
that
he
was
a
subversive
person
and
that
without
regard
to
whether
he
belong
to
an
organization
or
not
because
your
act
says,
i
am
not
a
subversive
person
or
i
do
not
belong
to
the
communist
party
or
any
other
organization.
and
then
there
is
a
definition
that
i
read
some
place
in
--
in
here
of
what
a
subversive
person
--
what
is
a
definition
of
a
subversive
person.
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
here
it
is,
i
--
i
think
on
page
63
of
the
--
or
64
of
the
appendix
to
your
brief.
this
is
the
statute,
it
says,
self
--
says
--
over
on
page
64
in
the
second
full
paragraph,
“subversive
person
means
any
person
who
commits,
attempts
to
commit
or
aids
in
the
commission
or
advocates,
abets,
advises
or
teaches
by
any
means,
any
person
to
commit
attempt
to
commit
or
aid
in
the
commission
of
any
act
intended
to
overthrow,
destroy
or
alter
the
--
the
government
or
who
is
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization
or
a
foreign
subversive
organization.”
now,
suppose
if
he
belong
to
--
to
the
communist
party
and
had
scienter
and
then
resigned
as
you
say
one
day
and
took
the
oath,
wouldn't
he
be
guilty
of
--
wouldn't
he
be
guilty
of
perjury
if
he
--
if
he
actually
fell
under
this
definition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
they're
on
page
64
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
your
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
mr.
fuller,
on
page
68,
as
--
as
justice
whittaker
read
to
you,
the
attorney
general,
the
personnel
director
and
the
civil
service
commission
of
any
county
and
so
forth
shall,
by
appropriate
rules
or
regulations,
prescribe
that
persons
with
--
being
subversive
and
so
forth,
have
--
has
your
office
ever
prescribe
any
such
rules?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
the
personnel
director
of
the
state
ever
done
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
--
has
anybody
who
is
ever
been
discharged
in
your
state
been
accorded
any
such
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
--
would
you
say
that
there
had
not
been
any
discharge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
you
give
these
people
a
hearing?
how
could
do
they
have
had
a
hearing
if
you
didn't
have
any
regulations
as
the
act
proscribes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
--
the
question
we
raise,
whether
they
asked
a
hearing,
you
say
they
--
you
think
they
could
--
they
should
be
given,
they
have
to
be
given
that
hearing.
how
can
you
give
them
a
hearing
if
you
don't
--
if
you
never
have
any
rules
or
regulations
under
this
act
under
which
they
could
be
heard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
you
have
a
moment
or
so,
mr.
ringold.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
there
was
a
stipulation
in
the
trial
below
that
--
to
the
effect
that
that
he
would
not
be
--
these
people
would
not
be
accorded
a
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
the
matter
of
stipulation
just
a
moment
ago.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
ringold.
in
your
brief,
you
state
that
--
that
the
1955
law
repealed
that
portion
of
the
law
which
--
which
accorded
a
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
and
mr.
fuller
says
that
that
law
as
it
set
out
on
--
on
page
67,
68
of
his
brief
is
still
a
law
and
that
such
a
hearing
can
be
held.
will
you
tell
us
why
there
is
that
difference
of
opinion
between
you
and
what
you
base
it
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
each
of
you
supply
us
with
--
with
your
briefs,
please,
a
copy
of
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
state
wasn't
a
company
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
supply
that
too,
please,
mr.
fuller?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
