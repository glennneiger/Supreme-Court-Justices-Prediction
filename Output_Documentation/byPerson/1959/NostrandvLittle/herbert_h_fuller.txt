mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
declaratory
judgment
action,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
provisions
of
chapter
377,
laws
of
1955,
state
of
washington
append
the
united
states
constitution.
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
perhaps
that
could
be
added,
your
honor.
i
think
the
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
the
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
i
think
the
only
way
to
answer
that
would
be
to
refer
to
the
record
and
to
examine
the
prayer
of
the
complaint.
and
in
the
complaint,
the
appellants
asked
for
an
adjudication,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
4
of
the
printed
record,
“for
an
adjudication
by
this
court
that
chapter
377,
laws
of
1955
violates
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
washington
and
is
therefore
void
and
have
no
effect.”
it's
on
page
4
of
the
printed
record.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
my
understanding
is
that
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
no,
the
supreme
court
of
the
states
of
washington
considered
the
act
vis-a-vis
the
two
professors
who
were
involved.
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
i
must
be
frank
in
saying
that
i
do
not
know.
i
think
that
some
of
the
confusion
of
all
parties
in
this
case
is
due
to
the
nature
of
the
case,
the
fact
that
it's
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
now
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
they
did
so
claim.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that's
--
it
was
to
that
that
i'm
referring
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
is
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
mr.
justice
clark,
that's
precisely
my
point
because
of
the
nature
of
the
action,
because
it's
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
these
professors
have
not
actually
been
dismissed,
we
can't
be
certain
just
what
would
have
happened,
whether
they
would
have
demanded
that
they
be
given
a
right
to
rehearing
and
if
they've
been
turn
down,
perhaps
they
could've
taken
it
on
appeal
to
the
court
below.
a
part
of
our
case,
as
you
will
see
as
i
attempt
to
develop,
is
that
the
fact
that
in
the
court
below,
we
claim
that
the
appellants
did
not
raise
the
question
of
a
lack
of
any
hearing.
the
reason
for
the
confusion,
i
believe,
is
because
this
issue
has
sprung
full-grown
upon
the
court
on
appeal
for
the
first
time.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
believe
i'm
correcting
in
saying
that
they
did
not,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
can
only
answer
that
we
can't
be
sure.
our
court
did
not
pass
upon
on
that
question
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
because
it
was
not
squarely
before
it,
mr.
justice
black
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
is
not
in
black
and
white.
it
would
be
a
matter
of
judicial
construction
by
our
highest
court
but
our
court
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
that
because
the
question
was
not
squarely
presented.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
we
have
no
act
that
would
apply
to
these
professors,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
my
understanding
is,
your
honor,
that
there
are
intramural
rules
that
the
president
and
the
board
of
regents
do
follow
certain
rules
as
far
as
dismissing
a
professor
but
these
rules
are
not
binding
upon
the
board
of
regents.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
on
that
point,
i'm
not
certain.
in
any
event,
it's
not
binding
upon
the
board
of
regents.
going
outside
the
record
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
sorry,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
was
on
the
page
15?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
can
only
answer
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
don't
believe
that
there
is.
the
principle
difference
between
the
1951
statute
and
the
1955
statute
is
the
fact
that
in
the
1955
statute,
the
legislature
has
named
the
communist
party
as
being
a
subversive
organization.
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
don't
believe
that
we
reproduce
that
section,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
excuse
me
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
will
say
this,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
lower
court
decision
and
the
question
is
what
did
the
--
what
did
the
state
supreme
court
pass
upon?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
i
think
again
we
have
to
reply
that
we
can't
be
certain
because
of
the
nature
of
the
action.
being
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
the
appellants
have
thrust
a
number
of
hypotheticals
before
the
court.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
would
say
that
it
was
not
squarely
before
the
state
supreme
court
because
the
men
where
not
actually
fired.
they
did
not
actually
demand
their
hearing.
they
were
sitting
back
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
and
project
them
that.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think,
your
honor,
my
only
answer
could
be
that
we
feel
that
that
issue
was
not
squarely
before
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
in
our
state,
the
only
matter
is
--
that
would
come
before
the
supreme
court
would
be
the
matters
which
have
been
squarely
raised
on
appeal.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
now
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
the
parts
of
a
case
which
are
on
appeal
are
determined
in
two
ways.
number
one,
by
the
notice
of
the
appeal
but
by
ordinary
and
practice,
the
notice
of
appeal
was
very
general.
number
two,
by
specific
assignments
of
error
in
the
brief.
now,
in
our
state,
if
you
do
not
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
is.
and
if
you
do
not
make
a
specific
assignment
of
error,
you're
not
entitled
to
raise
a
point
upon
appeal.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
i
do
not
have
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
that
information
specifically
before
me.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
of
the
record.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
will
say
this.
in
the
lower
court,
we
were
the
ones
who
did
the
appeal
and
they
were
responding
party,
so
it
wouldn't
--
the
specific
points
raised
on
appeal
would
not
be
germane.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
we
assign
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i'm
sure
that
would
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
can
only
answer
that
i'm
not
sure
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
in
our
brief
in
our
notice
--
in
our
notice
of
appeal,
i
believe,
to
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
no.s
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
on
the
hearing
point,
i
will
rest
my
case
with
what
i
have
said.
i
can
go
no
further
than
that
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
appellants
are
entitled
to
raise
this
issue
of
being
denied
a
fair
hearing
and
dismissal
being
automatic,
i
will
have
to
let
it
go
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
well,
i
will
say
this,
that
one
of
arguments
was
that
this
court
should
not
consider
the
argument
of
whether
a
dismissal
should
be
--
of
whether
the
appellants
had
a
right
to
rehiring
before
dismissal
because
the
argument
was
not
made
before
the
state
supreme
court.
now,
the
appellants
brief
is
before
this
court.
and
the
court
can
look
at
it
as
well
as
i
can
and
i
think
i
will
rest
my
case
on
that
point
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
brief.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
the
practice
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
my
reaction
is
that
they
did
not.
no
--
i
confess
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
particular
page,
but
i've
read
the
brief
a
number
of
times
in
considering
the
whole
brief.
my
reaction
is
that
they
have
not
raise
a
lack
of
hearing
point
before
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
in
the
state
of
washington
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
in
the
state
of
washington,
an
appellant
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
show
that
a
judgment
is
bad.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
would
be
the
appellant,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
was
the
appellant,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
right.
the
state
was
the
appellant
in
the
lower
court.
i
think
that
at
this
point,
it
might
be
well
to
consider
this
entire
statutory
system.
we're
considering
three
different
statutes.
and
i
think
part
of
the
confusion
comes
from
that
fact.
we
originally
had
a
1951
statute
which
was
fairly
comprehensive.
it
was
patterned
after
maryland's
ober
act.
now,
in
1953,
an
amendment
was
made
to
this
1951
statute
which
changed
the
definition
of
subversive
person
so
that
only
a
person
who
had
knowledge
of
the
aims
of
an
organization
would
be
considered
as
subversive
person.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
which
--
which
particular
provision
did
your
honor
refer
to?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
that
section
15
which
your
honor
refers
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
mr.
justice
black,
a
short
answer
to
that
is
no.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
the
1953
amendment
did
not
do
that.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
had
no
effect
upon
any
sort
of
a
hearing
for
the
reason
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
none
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
it
did
not
affect
the
1951
act
in
any
way
as
far
as
the
hearing
is
concerned.
it's
my
understanding.
the
only
thing
that
the
1953
amendment
did,
it's
very
short,
was
to
bring
the
1951
act
into
conformity
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
case
of
wieman
against
updegraff.
that's
all
with
the
1953
act
did,
as
i
understand
it.
now
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
by
changing
the
definition
of
a
subversive
person
by
requiring
that
a
person
could
not
be
defined
as
a
subversive
person
unless
he
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
subversive
nature
and
purposes
of
an
organization.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
it
was,
your
honor,
by
the
--
the
act
which
is
in
question,
the
1955
act.
the
1955
act
consists
of
four
sections.
now
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
will
show,
your
honor.
your
honor,
we'll
turn
to
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
page
70
of
my
brief.
i
think
it
might
be
well
at
this
point
to
read
the
entire
act,
it's
very
short
and
it
might
clear
up
some
questions.
section
1,
“every
person,
every
board,
commission,
counsel,
department,
court
or
other
agency
of
the
state
of
washington,
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof
who
or
which
appoints
or
employs
or
supervises
in
any
matter,
the
appointment
or
employment
of
public
employees
or
employes
shall
establish
by
rules,
regulations
or
otherwise,
procedures
designed
to
ascertain
whether
any
person
is
a
subversive
person.”
that
would
be
as
defined
in
the
1951
act.
“in
securing
any
facts
necessary
to
ascertain
the
information
herein
required,
the
applicant
shall
be
required
to
assign
a
written
statement
containing
answers
to
such
inquiries
as
may
be
material
which
statement
shall
contain
notice
that
it
is
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury.”
now,
the
new
provision,
i
believe,
starts
with
the
word
“every”.
“every
such
person,
board,
commission,
counsel,
department,
court
or
rather
agency
shall
require
every
employee
or
applicant
for
employment
to
state
under
oath
whether
or
not
he
or
she
is,”
and
i
emphasis
the
word
“is”,
“is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
other
subversive
organization.
in
refusal
to
answer
on
any
grounds
shall
be
cause
for
immediate
termination
of
such
employees,
employment
or
for
refusal
to
accept
his
or
her
application
for
employment.”
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
--
it
had
the
language
up
to
the
word
“every”.
now,
see
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
that
is
correct.
this
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
mr.
justice
black,
section
12,
before
it
was
amended,
can
be
found
on
page
65
of
our
brief
at
the
bottom
of
page
65.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
not
necessary
to
spend
anytime
with
section
2
of
the
1955
act
because
that
merely
provides
that
the
act
shall
not
be
applicable
to
positions
which
are
found
to
be
non-sensitive
positions.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
can
think
of
no
decisions,
your
honor.
now,
the
third
section
of
1955
act
is
not
before
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
page
71
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
was
the
1951
act,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
and
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
it
is.
that
particular
provision
referred
to
employees
who
were
employed
by
the
state
at
the
time
the
1951
act
took
effect.
first
of
all,
let
me
be
sure,
and
i'm
reading
on
the
same
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
at
the
top
of
our
brief
or
starting
at
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
section
15?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
section
is
still
part
of
our
law,
your
honor.
that
was
not
amended
by
the
1955
act.
it
referred
to
persons
who
were
in
government
service
at
the
time
the
1951
act
took
effect.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
i
cannot
say,
your
honor,
that's
not
in
the
record.
i
don't
know.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes.
now,
the
third
section
of
the
1955
act
is
actually
not
before
this
court
for
its
consideration.
in
that
section,
the
state
legislature
purported
to
declare
certain
organizations
which
were
on
the
attorney
general's
list
as
subversive
organization.
this
section
was
declared
by
our
court
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
the
fourth
and
final
section
of
the
1955
act
added
a
new
provision.
it
did
not
amend
any
previous
section
except
perhaps
inferentially
the
1951
act.
section
4
provided,
“the
communist
party
is
a
subversive
organization
within
the
purview
of
rcw
9.81,”
that's
the
ober
act,
the
washington's
counterpart
of
the
ober
act,
“and
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
a
subversive
activity
hereunder.”
now,
the
reason
that
i've
taken
this
time
to
point
out
this
system
statutes
is
to
show
that
the
1955
act
is
not
simply
a
one
shot
proposition.
it
is
a
part
of
a
pattern
of
acts
noted
by
our
legislature
over
a
period
years
commencing
in
1951.
the
1951
act
itself
was
passed
pursuant
to
executive
request
in
the
wake
of
fact
finding
hearings
by
a
legislative
fact
finding
committee.
then
they
amended
the
act
in
1953
to
bring
it
into
conformity
with
this
court's
decision
in
wieman
against
updegraff.
the
point
is
that
the
legislature
passed
the
1955
act
not
of
something
completely
new
but
in
the
light
of
its
experience
having
worked
for
the
1951
act
with
the
previous
amendments.
at
this
point,
i
wish
to
emphasize
one
thing.
the
only
thing
that
this
act
prohibits
is
for
a
person
who
is
presently
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
other
subversive
organization
from
holding
a
sensitive
position
in
state
government.
if
a
person
resigns
from
the
communist
party
today,
he
can
hold
a
sensitive
position
in
government
tomorrow.
if
a
person
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
today,
he
can
hold
the
position
in
state
or
local
government
which
is
declared
non-sensitive.
our
position
is
that
the
act
sets
forth
only
bare
minimal
requirements.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
my
position
is
that
even
if
the
act
is
construed,
even
assuming
arguendo
that
the
act
does
not
afford
a
hearing,
the
act
is
constitutional.
we
think
that
the
court
should
first
look
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
depravation
of
substantive
due
process.
and
if
the
court
finds
there
is
no
depravation
of
substantive
due
process,
that
is
that
the
legislature
does
have
a
right
to
make
this
requirement,
we
feel
the
court
should
find
that
there
is
no
depravation
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct.
one
of
them
teaches
romance
languages
and
other
teaches
history.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
as
far
as
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
the
way
the
act
has
set
up,
all
positions
are
considered
sensitive
unless
they
are
specifically
found
to
be
non-sensitive.
these
positions
have
not
specifically
been
found
to
be
non-sensitive.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
i
don't
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
that
there
are
positions
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
think
we'll
have
to
just
admit
right
at
the
start
that
there
are
positions
which
are
non-sensitive.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
argument
is
made
by
the
appellants
that
this
position
is
non-sensitive,
the
position
of
a
professor
in
university,
professor
of
romance
languages
or
professor
of
history.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
does
not.
the
appellants'
argument
regarding
both
procedural
and
substantive
due
process
seems
to
hinge
on
five
cases.
i
think
that
we
can
approach
the
heart
of
the
argument
if
we
approach
these
five
cases.
the
appellants
relied
upon
the
slochower
case,
the
schware
case,
the
konigsberg
case,
the
adler
case
and
the
case
of
wieman
against
updegraff.
now,
we
submit
that
these
cases
can
be
distinguished
that
these
cases
are
not
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
1955
act
is
unconstitutional.
in
the
slochower
case,
the
vice
of
that
case
was
the
fact
that
the
investigation
was
not
made
by
the
school
authority
but
the
school
authority
drew
a
wrongful
inference
on
the
basis
of
an
investigation
made
by
the
federal
government.
there's
no
need
to
deliver
this
point
here
because
this
point
was
made
by
the
court
itself
in
the
beilan
case
and
case
of
globe
against
los
angeles.
now,
in
the
adler
case,
the
appellants
argue
that
because
an
administrative
hearing
was
necessary
in
the
adler
case,
it
would
be
a
depravation
of
procedural
due
process
not
to
afford
a
hearing
in
the
present
case.
and
here,
we
come
to
one
distinction
which
is
perhaps
the
greatest
distinction
in
the
entire
line
of
cases.
new
york's
feinberg
law
referred
not
only
to
present
membership
in
an
organization
but
the
fienberg
law
said
that
a
person
could
be
dismissed
for
having
committed
the
act
of
joining
a
subversive
organization.
here,
we
are
concerned
only
with
present
membership.
now,
it's
understandable
that
if
a
person
can
be
dismissed
for
mere
past
membership,
it
might
well
be
a
constitutional
requirement
that
this
person
be
afforded
a
hearing.
but
in
the
present
case,
where
it
is
only
present
membership,
it
is
not
necessarily
to
inquire
into
the
reasons
why
he
resigned
from
the
party
because
he
didn't
resign,
reasons
why
he
joined,
the
court
was
interested
in
seeing
that
a
person
did
not
wrongfully
suffer.
if
a
person
is
knowingly,
presently
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization,
we
submit
they
could
not
be
held
to
be
innocent.
now,
one
of
the
most
important
cases
bearing
upon
this
case
is
the
case
of
wieman
against
updegraff.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
a
question
earlier,
he
said,
“was
the
oath
in
the
wieman
case
similar
to
the
oath
in
the
present
case?”
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
the
oath
in
the
wieman
case
was
different
because
it
referred
not
only
to
present
membership
in
a
subversive
organization
but
it
also
went
back,
i
believe,
five
years.
in
other
words,
in
the
case
of
wieman
against
updegraff,
if
a
young
person
were
to
join
an
organization,
maybe
even
the
communist
party,
were
to
learn
of
its
true
aims
and
were
to
resign
from
the
party
within
a
week,
that
fact
which
stand
as
a
bar
to
his
employment.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
impediment.
now,
because
the
oklahoma
act
would
bar
a
person
from
employment
who
innocently
joined
an
organization
which
was
actually
subversive,
this
court
held
that
it
violated
--
it
was
a
deprivation
without
due
process.
in
the
present
case,
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
a
person
could
say
that
he
is
innocent,
either
he
knows
of
the
--
the
purposes
of
an
organization
or
he
does
not.
if
he
does
not
know
the
purposes
of
an
organization,
he
would
automatically
sign
the
oath.and
it's
difficult
to
see
how
he
could
be
held
guilty
of
perjury.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
i
said
that
if
a
person
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct.
and
that
has
been
construed
by
our
court,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
there
has
been
none
because
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
that
is
part
of
the
difficulty.
we
are
dealing
with
hypothetical
situations.
there
is
no
clear
case
before
the
lower
court.
this
court
is
--
we
have
to
guess
to
what
a
situation
maybe
in
the
future.
the
court
has
held
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
mr.
justice
black,
getting
down
to
cases,
the
oath
says,
“that
i
am
not
a
subversive
person
or
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
another
subversive
organization
for
another
or
otherwise,
which
engages
in
or
advocates,
abets,
advises,”
and
then
it
goes
from
there.
“but
the
point
is
i
am
not
a
member
of
any
subversive
organization
or
a
member
of
the
communist
party.”
if
a
person
does
not
know
that
an
organization
is
subversive
and
our
court
having
held
that
scienter
is
implied
in
every
part
of
the
oath.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it's
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
it's
in
the
decision,
it's
in
the
record.
it's
--
it
was
in
this
case,
the
present
case.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
in
this
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
the
court
held
that
scienter
was
implied
in
each
and
every
part
of
the
oath.
now,
of
course,
as
i've
said
before
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
action
that's
part
of
the
difficulty.
the
specific
facts
are
not
before
this
court.
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
the
lower
court
held
that
scienter
was
implied
in
every
part
of
this
oath.
we
submit
that
the
difference
between
past
membership
and
present
membership
is
decisive.
a
person
might
well
be
inveigled
into
an
organization
innocently.
but
it
is
different
if
he
is
presently
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization
or
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
one
of
our
most
important
points.
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
other
subversive
organization
could
resign
today
and
take
the
oath
tomorrow.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
as
opposing
counsel
has
said
this
again
comes
back
to
the
question
of
whether
he
belongs
to
a
subversive
organization
because
the
definition
of
a
subversive
person
in
our
statute
is
one
who
belongs
to
a
subversive
organization.
so
if
he
resigned
from
the
subversive
organization
today,
he
would
not
be
a
subversive
person
tomorrow.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
no
that
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct.
your
honor
has
asked
me
--
asked
me
originally
the
question,
“could
a
person
resign
today
and
be
considered
a
non-subversive
person
tomorrow?”
my
answer
was
yes,
based
upon
the
organizational
membership
but
that
would
have
to
be
qualified
by
the
section
which
your
honor
has
just
read
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
regarding
individual
advocacy.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
was
referring
to
only
the
portion
of
the
act
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
sorry,
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
it
is.
we
submit
that
the
legislature
has
been
reasonable
in
passing
such
an
act.
it's
true
the
--
the
court
must
balance
the
effect
upon
the
individual
with
the
societal
interest
to
do
that
in
every
case.
but
here,
the
legislature
has
said
that
they
do
not
want
people
who
are
presently
members
of
the
communist
party
or
other
subversive
organization
to
hold
sensitive
positions
in
our
government.
now,
there's
no
need
to
dwell
upon
the
communist
danger.
i
realized
that
point
can
be
over
dramatized.
i
think
this
court,
itself,
in
the
adler
case
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
danger
of
communist
propaganda
to
settle,
to
allow
detection
being
disseminated
in
our
classrooms.
this
is
the
danger
which
the
legislature
was
seeking
to
prevent.
and
we
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
the
case
law
of
this
court,
the
legislature
had
a
right
to
do
so.
there
are
two
cases
which
are
almost
exactly
in
point
both
of
them
were
referred
to
by
counsel.
the
first
case
is
the
case
of
the
american
communications
association
against
douds.
the
second
case
is
the
gerende
against
board
of
election
case.
now,
we
submit
that
the
distinction
made
by
counsel
in
the
case
of
american
communications
association
against
douds
is
a
distinction
without
a
meaning.
in
the
douds
case,
this
court
held
that
congress
had
a
right
to
have
a
non-communist
affidavit
and
to
demand
that
union
leaders,
who
are
members
of
union
seeking
to
avail
themselves
in
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
signed
this
non
--
this
non-communist
affidavit.
this
is
very
similar
to
the
present
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
danger
of
political
strikes
was
sufficient
to
justify
this
abridgement
of
the
right
of
the
individual.
the
court
held
that
the
action
that
congress
had
taken
was
reasonably
related
to
the
danger
involved.
we
submit
that
is
true
in
the
present
case.
now,
the
distinction
that
counsel
pointed
to
by
saying
that
it
affected
the
individual
only
indirectly
by
providing
that
the
labor
union
could
not
avail
itself
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
a
distinction
ought
to
mean
because
it
had
the
effect
of
discouraging
communist
party
membership.
it
had
the
effect
of
affecting
future
action
the
same
as
the
requirement
--
the
affidavit
requirement
in
the
present
case.
now,
it's
true,
the
--
in
the
gerende
case,
there
was
only
a
per
curiam
decision.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
plain
holding
of
that
case
is,
the
plain
effect
to
that
case
is
a
that
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
was
not
able
to
sign
the
oath
and
to
be
elected
to
office
in
the
guise
of
belonging
to
one
of
the
major
established
parties.
there
again,
the
court
inferentially
at
least
held
that
the
danger
of
this
happening
was
sufficiently
great
to
force
a
man
to
come
forward
and
state
his
views.
because
of
the
limited
time
remaining,
i
will
not
spend
much
time
on
the
bill
of
attainder
argument
especially
since
counsel
concedes
that
under
the
law,
this
court
should
hold
that
there
is
no
bill
of
attainder
in
the
present
case.
he
is
asking
that
the
court
overturn
its
holding
in
the
garner
case
and
in
the
douds
case.
our
point
would
be
this.
since
there
is
no
penalty
involved,
since
there
is
no
penalty
involved
in
the
douds
case,
there
is
no
penalty
involved
in
the
present
case.
and
if
there
is
no
penalty
involved
in
the
present
case,
it
would
constitute
a
mere
advisory
opinion
for
this
court
to
state
that
a
bill
of
attainder
could
be
prospective
in
operation
as
well
as
being
retrospective
in
operation.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
the
penalty
in
the
lovett
case
was
a
previous
act
committed
by
mr.
lovett
and
mr.
douds
and
the
other
individual
involved.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
there
was
a
penalty.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
the
penalty
was
a
writer
attached
to
an
appropriation
act
which
had
the
effect
of
dismissing
them
from
their
jobs
for
past
activities.
we
submit
that
there's
no
penalty
involved
in
this
case
and
therefore,
the
court
should
not
pass
upon
the
bare
question
of
whether
there
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
that
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
in
the
loose
sense,
it's
something
that
hurts.
now,
in
the
lovett
case,
you,
yourself,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
understand
that.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
understand
that
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
your
honor
but
i
think
that
the
language
is
particularly
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
you
have
to
measure
the
interest
which
is
being
protected.
if
a
person
loses
his
job
as
a
result
of
the
government
trying
to
protect
students
in
the
schools
from
being
a
part
of
a
captive
audience
where
they
would
be
subjected
to
communist
propaganda,
if
a
person
inferentially
loses
his
job,
we
submit
that
that
would
not
be
such
sufficient
penalty
to
constitute
a
bill
of
attainder.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
as
you,
yourself,
said
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think,
your
honor,
said
in
the
lovett
case,
in
an
individual
opinion,
that
if
it
is
not
an
ex
post
facto
law,
the
reasons
it
is
not
are
persuasive
that
it
cannot
be
a
bill
of
attainder.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
am
not
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
am
not
citing
this
as
being
authority.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i'm
not
citing
this
is
case
authority.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
but
i
feel
that
the
language
is
apt
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
would
understand
that
to
mean
the
present
tense.
that
he's
actually
doing?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
section
(e)
of
our
act?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
our
act
also
puts
things
in
the
present
tense,
if
that
is
your
honors'
point.
it
should
be
notice
that
the
language
in
the
bottom
of
section
(e)
on
page
64
the
language
in

is
no
longer
a
part

that
has
been
amended
by
the
1953
amendment
which
was
made
in
the
wake
of
the
case
of
wieman
against
updegraff.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
--
your
point
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
is
that
they're
not
identical.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
do
i
read
subsection
(e)?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
would
be
my
personal
reaction.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
it
is
the
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
can
only
answer
that
i
do
not
know.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
my
reaction
would
be
that
it
would
be.
now,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i'm
sorry.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i've
given
my
reaction
on
it
and
i
can
do
no
more,
your
honor.
turning
just
for
one
moment
to
the
claim,
the
third
argument
of
the
appellants
that
the
1955
act
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
i
think
we
will
first
point
to
the
case
upon
which
the
appellants
rely
and
then
attempt
to
show
that
some
of
the
cases
which
support
our
position.
now,
the
principal
case
which
was
cited
was
the
case
of
west
virginia
state
board
of
education
against
barnette.
we
submit
that
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
the
present
case
because
in
the
case
of
west
virginia
state
board
education
against
barnette,
this
court
held
that
the
government
could
not
force
a
man
to
profess
something
in
which
he
did
not
believe.
in
the
present
case,
we
are
forcing
a
man
to
profess
as
to
what
he
does
belief.
now,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
interest
of
the
government
to
be
protected
because
in
the
west
virginia
case,
the
government
could
show
no
interest
in
forcing
to
a
man
to
go
through
a
ritual
to
say
something
which
he
did
not
believe.
but
here,
the
interest
in
protecting
the
children
and
the
students
in
the
schools
is
sufficient,
we
submit,
to
warrant
the
restriction
and
the
rights
of
an
individual
to
force
him
to
come
forward
and
make
a
positive
statement.
we
submit
that
there
is
an
entire
line
of
cases
which
holds
that
the
1955
act
is
valid.
we
submit
that
douds
case
is
authority
for
that
proposition.
in
addition,
there's
the
case
of
united
public
workers
against
mitchell
involving
the
hatch
act.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
the
interest
of
the
government
in
maintaining
a
loyal
civil
service
was
sufficient
to
warrant
the
abridgement
of
the
rights
of
those
civil
servants
to
the
extent
that
they
could
not
engage
and
i
believe
the
words
were
actual
--
active
political
management.
again,
in
the
garner
case,
the
court
held
that
the
city
of
los
angeles
had
a
right
to
force
a
man
to
come
forward
and
make
statement
that
the
interest
of
the
state
in
maintaining
loyal
employees
was
sufficient
to
justify
that.
now,
finally,
and
this
is
the
final
case
that
i
wish
to
mention
to
the
court.
there
is
the
recent
case
of
speiser
against
randall.
and
at
first
blush,
it
maybe
surprising
that
i
would
mention
this
case.
it
will
be
noted
that
it
is
not
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief.
even
though
the
courts
stuck
down
an
oath
this
case
and
to
my
knowledge
this
and
the
case
of
wieman
against
updegraff
are
the
only
recent
cases
were
an
oath
has
been
struck
down.
even
though
an
oath
was
struck
down
in
this
case,
there
is
still
language
in
that
case
to
the
effect
that
where
the
requirement
more
limited,
had
the
requirement
applied
to
a
more
specific
group
such
as
perhaps
school
teachers
or
such
as
perhaps
union
leaders
as
in
the
--
the
douds
case
require
the
--
the
act
may
have
been
saved.
so
the
court
not
only
made
the
distinction
by,
in
our
opinion,
reaffirm
these
previous
acts.
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
that
it's
always
difficult
for
a
lawyer
to
ask
for
an
abridgement
to
any
sort
of
human
liberty,
to
ask
for
restriction
of
that
liberty.
but
there
are
times
when
a
restriction
is
necessary
as
is
shown
by
the
opinions
of
this
court,
and
we
submit
that
this
is
one
of
those
times.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
court
does
not
make
any
judgment
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
legislation
and
that
is
why
arguments
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
or
as
to
its
need,
that
is
correct.
the
only
thing
that
this
court
will
consider
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
we
feel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
my
answer
would
be,
your
honor,
that
the
19
--
the
section
15
was
not
affected
by
either
of
the
19
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
was
not
affected,
not
affected
by
either
the
1953
or
the
1955
act
and
it
would
still
be
good
today.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
except
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
except
as
to
membership
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
1955
act
proscribed
that.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that's
why
we
seem
to
provide,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
because
that
point
was
not
directly
argued.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i'm
saying
that
might
well
be
one
interpretation
of
it.
but
my
argument
was
even
assuming
arguendo
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
no,
it
has
not
been
so
interpreted
because
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct,
i
have
not,
but
there
has
been
no
case
coming
before
the
court
under
a
specific
set
of
facts.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
have
to
ask
a
question
before
i
can
answer
that,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
for
a
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
for
a
membership
in
another
organization?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
the
only
answer
would
be
that
the
court
has
not
pass
squarely
upon
it.
the
court
held
that
every
part
of
the
oath
should
contain
scienter.
the
--
the
court
--
the
court
did
not
make
a
specific
holding
regarding
right
to
a
hearing.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct.
it
did
reverse
the
judgement.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct,
but
we
submit
that
in
their
briefs,
the
appellants
here,
the
respondents
below
did
not
argue
the
point
of
fair
hearing.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
such
rules.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
know
of
none.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
as
to
that,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
do
not
know.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
no
i
do
not
know
of
anybody
who
has
actually
been
discharged.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
would
say
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case,
your
honor.
i'm
hesitant
to
be
causative
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
but
i
know
of
no
case
where
anybody
has
been
discharged
for
that
reason.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
no,
i
know
of
none.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
we
feel
that
it
did
not.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
that.
how
could
you
give
them
a
hearing?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
mr.
chief
justice,
of
course,
you're
correct,
if
something
came
up,
they
would
be
necessary
to
start
from
the
ground
up
and
to
have
actual
regulations
and
to
--
to
hold
a
hearing.
but
it
couldn't
be
done
without
the
rules
and
regulations
which
you
mentioned.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
that
is
correct.
but
again,
i
think
---
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
some
uncertainty
here,
your
honor,
because
the
court
has
never
passed
upon
this,
we
do
not
know.
now,
what
you
say
sounds
correct,
i
can
only
answer
that
our
court
has
not
passed
upon
that.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
that
might
well
be
the
case.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i'll
make
the
statement
for
the
court
on
that
very
point.
representing
the
attorney
general,
it
is
my
opinion
that
under
section
15,
it
has
been
referred
to
the
individuals
affected
might
well
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
might
well
be.
now,
i
can't
be
certain
because
i'm
not
sure
how
our
court
would
--
i
can't
guess
what
our
court
would
say
but
i
was
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
in
a
sense
that
is
it.
my
interpretation
would
be,
they
might
well
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
no.
now,
i
should
make
that
provision
there.
i
--
i
will
say
this,
that
as
far
as
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
concern
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i'll
say
this.
that
might
well
be
the
case.
i
can't
be
certain.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
my
personal
interpretation
is
that
it
would
afford
them
a
hearing.
that
is
my
personal
guess
as
to
what
the
supreme
court
would
do.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
will,
mr.
chief
justice.
