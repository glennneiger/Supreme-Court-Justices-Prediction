justice

what
was
in
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
still
water
create
sediments?
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
bring
some
wood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
if
you
do
not
have
the
remedy
of
injunction
which
you've
been
talking
about,
is
there
any
other
remedy
in
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
particular
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
--
where
is
that?
what's
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
section
10
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
that's
limited
according
to
their
argument
to
structures,
actual
structures.
assuming
they
are
right
on
that,
does
the
government
have
any
remedy
as
to
this
settlement
at
the
bottom
of
the
river?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
would
say
that
you
had
the
right
to
try
them
criminally,
but
did
not
have
the
right
to
enjoin
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
take
--
would
you
take
that
position
that
the
only
remedy
congress
had
provided
was
to
make
it
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
--
that's
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
doesn't
make
this
unlawful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
either
one
of
you
discussed
the
application
of
the
sanitary
district
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
shouldn't
--
i
didn't
make
my
question
quite
focused
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
the
only
point
i
was
interested
in
quite
enough.
in
construing
section
10
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
was
given
a
very
broad
construction
by
the
court,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
water
was
withdrawn,
it
nevertheless
created
an
obstruction,
because
it
made
it
less
navigable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
you'll
have
an
argument
in
the
morning
if
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
part
of
--
it's
a
part
of
the
opinion
on
page
428
and
429
with
reference
to
section
10.
that's
the
part
i
was
interested
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
do
you
think
it's
used?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
why
do
you
think
he
used
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
--
did
he
base
the
holding
on
the
fact,
at
least
on
that
part
or
can
it
be
said
that
he
did
not
base
it
on
the
subject?
that
there
was
an
obstruction
merely
by
the
fact
that
they
had
drawn
water
out
and
that
was
enough
to
violate
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
--
are
there
any
difference
in
spite
of
the
physical
fact
concerned
except
that
here,
it's
--
the
depth
has
decreased
by
this
silt
or
whatever
you
call
it
is
on
the
but
--
but
that
that
was
decrease
because
they
withdrew
water
from
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
of
them
constitute
equally
an
obstruction
of
navigation?
i'm
not
talking
about
your
thirteenth
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
section
are
you
referring
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
printed
anywhere
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
you
have
it
printed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
like
to
have
then
is
on
a
little
(inaudible)
assuming
that
one
believes
in
the
prior.
does
the
government
have
any
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
assuming
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
assuming
that
your
position
should
be
rejected
that
13
makes
10
irrelevant
and
the
10
does
apply,
what
is
the
government's
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
remedy
does
it
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
remedy
would
it
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
remedy
granted
in
the
senate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
granted
under
10?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
granted
on
this
--
under
10
because
of
the
violation
of
10?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
an
obstruction
even
if
we
believe
it's
an
obstruction
under
10.
it's
not
the
kind
of
an
obstruction
what
--
which
the
government
could
get
--
get
relief
against
by
injunction?
