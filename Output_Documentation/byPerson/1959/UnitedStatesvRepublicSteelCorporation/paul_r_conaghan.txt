mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
for
adjournment
yesterday
afternoon,
mr.
justice
black
was
discussing
with
mr.
jackson
the
case
of
sanitary
district
versus
united
states
in
266
u.s.
i
proposed
first
to
present
an
analysis
of
that
case.
this
was
an
--
unanimous
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
the
illinois
statutes
permitted
a
diversion
from
lake
michigan
of
600,000
cubic
feet
per
minute.
the
secretary
of
war
by
permit
allowed
a
diversion
from
lake
michigan
of
250,000
cubic
feet
per
minute.
the
sanitary
district,
1913,
asked
the
secretary
of
war
to
divert
from
lake
michigan
10,000
cubic
feet
per
second,
considerably
more
than
250,000
cubit
feet
per
minute.
the
sanitary
district
--
this
application
for
a
permit
was
denied
but
the
district
persisted
in
diverting
more
water
than
permitted
by
the
secretary
of
war.
and
then
the
united
states
brought
the
suit
in
equity
to
restrain
the
state
of
illinois
and
its
subdivision,
the
sanitary
district
from
taking
more
than
250,000
cubic
feet
per
minute
from
lake
michigan
and
diverting
it
to
the
des
plaines
river
and
illinois
river
to
the
mississippi
river
basin.
now,
the
sanitary
district
in
that
case
denied
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
determine
the
amount
of
water
that
should
flow
through
the
channel
to
the
mississippi
basin
and
also
deny
the
right
of
the
secretary
of
war
to
determine
the
manner
of
the
flow.
mr.
justice
holmes
stated
in
his
opinion
at
page
426
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
that
evidence
is
necessary
to
show
that
the
withdrawal
of
water
on
a
scale
directed
by
the
statutes
of
illinois
threatens
and
will
affect
the
level
of
the
lakes,
and
that
is
a
matter
which
cannot
be
done
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states.
now,
mr.
justice
holmes
proceeded
to
"the
first
and
third
clauses
of
section
10
of
the
1899
statutes,"
which
i
would
refer
to
as
section
403,
u.s.
code
annotated,
33
volume.
the
court
then
stated
at
page
429
as
now
applied,
it
concerns
a
change
in
condition
of
the
lakes
and
the
chicago
river
admitted
to
be
navigable.
now
clearly,
in
making
that
statement,
mr.
justice
holmes
was
referring
to
the
third
clause
of
section
10
or
section
403.
but
then
he
continued
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
which
reads,
“and
it
shall
not
be
lawful
to
excavate
or
fail
or
in
any
manner
to
alter
it
or
modify
the
course,
location,
condition,
or
capacity
of
any
port,
roadstead,
haven,
harbor,
canal,
lake,
harbor
of
refuges,
or
inclosure
within
the
limits
of
any
breakwater
or
within
the
channel
of
any
navigable
water
of
the
united
states,
unless
the
work
has
been
recommended
by
the
chief
of
engineers
and
authorized
by
the
secretary
of
the
army
prior
to
the
beginning
of
this,
sir.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
we
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
you
mean
this
particular
clause
in
the
section?
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
it's
the
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
the
magic
word
is
condition.
the
condition
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
--
of
the
lakes
and
rivers
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
we
have
conditions,
but
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
have
the
work
as
it
is
understood
by
sanitary
engineers,
that
is
a
--
a
technical
word
that
refers
to
--
to
gates
gates,
to
machinery,
to
open
gates,
to
speed
the
flow
of
water
or
to
any
mode
of
construction
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
navigable
waters.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
that
is
quite
true
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
no,
mr.
justice
holmes
in
this
decision
he
did
not.
in
his
subsequent
decision
in
281
u.s.
he
did.
he
then
referred
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
that's
wisconsin
versus
illinois,
but
he
was
construing
the
same
section.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes.
on
the
same
point,
because
the
wisconsin
and
other
great
lake
states
joining
in
that
case
complained
to
the
court
that
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
sanitary
district
was
not
complying
with
the
provisions
of
the
permit
issued
by
the
secretary
of
war,
and
that
as
a
result,
the
level
of
the
great
lakes
was
going
down.
and
they
--
they
complained
about
this
because
it
was
--
so
they
claimed
ruining
commerce
and
destroying
the
shores
and
materially
affecting
navigation.
there
is
some
language
in
the
sanitary
district
case
which
i
would
like
to
refer
to
that
also
is
one
page
429.
mr.
justice
holmes
says,
“if
that
be
necessary
and
obstruction
to
their
navigable
capacity,”
referring
to
the
lakes
of
course.
now,
the
word
obstruction
is
not
within
the
third
clause
of
section
10
which
i
have
just
read,
condition
is
there
and
he
--
as
anything
affecting
the
condition
of
a
lake
or
navigable
river.
obstruction
appears
in
the
first
clause
of
section
10
and
i
shall
i
read
it.
“the
creation
--
that
the
creation
of
any
obstruction
not
affirmatively
authorized
by
congress
to
the
navigable
capacity
of
any
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states
is
hereby
prohibited.”
now,
the
reference
to
obstruction
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
sanitary
district
case,
really
was
surplusage
because
that
first
clause
must
be
construed
with
section
9
which
is
now
section
401
in
the
code.
in
other
words
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
i
didn't
understand
you
mr.
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
i
don't
know.
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
decision.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes,
he
--
he
there
quoted
the
--
the
first
clause
and
the
third
clause
of
section
10.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
i'm
now
trying
to
analyze.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes.
he
--
he
held
clearly
that
what
the
sanitary
district
was
doing
was
a
violation
of
section
10.
but
he
referred
in
his
decision
to
the
first
clause
of
section
10
and
the
third
clause
of
section
10
and
i
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes.
and
there
is
also
a
violation,
a
clear
violation
of
the
permit
issued
by
the
secretary
of
war.
there
was
that,
and
then
there
was
a
claim
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
it
had
the
right
to
dictate
to
the
sanitary
district
how
much
it
should
take
from
lake
michigan
notwithstanding
the
permit
issued
by
the
secretary
for
a
lesser
amount.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
--
the
issue
in
the
sanitary
district
case
was
relatively
simple.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
from
the
top.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes.
no,
i
--
i
think
not
your
honor.
and
i'd
like
to
explain
it
this
way.
in
the
1899
statutes,
the
court
--
the
congress
did
in
section
10
provide
for
obstructions
to
navigation
unless
--
and
that
they
were
unlawful
unless
affirmatively
authorized
by
congress.
but
the
prior
section
provided
specifically
what
construction
should
receive
the
approval
of
the
congress
and
not
the
secretary
of
war
and
approved
by
the
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
--
chief
of
engineers.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
that
is
section
401
of
the
code.
it
is
not
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
no,
it
--
it
is
not.
it's
not
contained
there.
but
it
is
33
u.s.c.
401
or
section
9
of
the
1899
act.
i
shall
read
it.
it
appears
on
page
35
of
the
brief
for
republic.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes,
on
page
35
of
our
brief
for
republic.
“it
shall
not
be
lawful
to
construct
or
commence
the
construction
of
any
bridge,
dam,
dike,
or
causeway
over
or
in
any
port,
roadstead,
haven,
harbor,
canal,
navigable
river
or
other
navigable
water
of
the
united
states
until
a
consent
of
congress
to
the
building
of
such
structure
shall
have
been
obtained.
and
until
the
plans
for
the
same
shall
have
been
submitted
and
approved
by
the
chief
of
engineers
and
by
the
secretary
of
the
army.”
close
quote
of
that
first
part
of
section
401.
now,
this
court
in
wisconsin
versus
illinois
in
the
278
illinois
construed
the
language
and
referred
to
section
9
or
this
section
401
that
i've
just
read.
at
278
u.s.
page
412
wisconsin-illinois
which
is
quoted
on
page
33
of
the
brief
for
republic,
the
court
stated,
“the
words
affirmatively
authorized
by
congress
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
administrative
executives
which
prompted
the
delegation
of
authority
in
the
succeeding
clauses.
congress,
having
stated
in
section
9
as
to
what
particular
structures
is
its
specific
consent
should
be
required,
intended
to
leave
to
the
secretary
of
war,
acting
on
recommendation
of
the
chief
engineers
the
determination
of
what
should
be
approved
and
authorized
in
classes
of
cases
described
in
the
second
and
third
clauses
of
section
10.”
now,
here
is
the
most
important
part
of
this
quotation
which
was
omitted
from
the
government's
brief
in
this
case.
“if
the
section
were
construed
to
require
a
special
authorization
by
congress,
whenever
in
any
aspect
it
might
be
considered
that
there
was
an
obstruction
to
navigable
capacity,
none
of
the
undertakings
specifically
provided
in
the
second
and
third
clauses
of
section
10
could
safely
be
undertaken
without
a
special
authorization
of
congress.”
we
do
not
think
this
was
intended.
this
court
also
stated
in
u.s.
versus
appalachian
power
referred
to
on
page
36
of
the
brief
for
republic,
“sections
9
and
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
make
it
unlawful
to
construct
a
dam
in
any
navigable
water
of
the
united
states
without
the
consent
of
congress.”
now,
it's
obvious
that
the
court
there
in
referring
to
sections
9
and
10
referred
only
to
the
first
clause
of
section
10
and
that
the
court
in
the
appalachian
case
considered
section
9
to
be
in
pari
materia
with
section
10.
so
that
if
we
follow
the
contention
of
the
government
here,
it
will
amount
to
a
repeal
of
the
language
quoted
from
wisconsin
versus
illinois
in
278
u.s.
page
412
and
also
a
material
of
this
--
a
material
modification
of
this
language
i
have
just
quoted
from
the
appalachian
case.
and
there
--
there
is
--
there
is
no
basis.
we
submit
for
--
for
modifying
or
amending
or
revising
the
--
the
law
which
has
been
well
settled
for
many
years
and
well
reasoned
for
that
matter.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
condition
because
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
--
he
takes
that
from
clause
three.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
referred
to
that
case,
first
of
all,
because
mr.
justice
black
referred
to
it,
and
secondly,
because
the
government
is
relying
upon
words
taken
out
of
context
from
the
sanitary
district
case.
the
respondents
get
no
comfort
out
of
the
sanitary
district
case.
we
say
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
our
situation.the
issue
is
relatively
simple
than
the
sanitary
district
case.
here
was
the
state
legislature
of
illinois
and
the
sanitary
district
of
municipal
corporation
trying
to
tell
congress
that
it
had
no
power
to
delegate
to
the
secretary
of
war
and
chief
of
engineers
matters
with
respect
to
navigation
as
it
affected
the
sanitary
district.
but
we
all
know
that
the
--
the
power
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
navigable
waters
is
plenary
and
supreme.
and
once
congress
has
spoken
and
delegated
to
the
proper
officials
in
a
constitutional
manner,
there,
the
--
the
law
then
becomes
simple
because
whatever
congress
says
is
supreme.
we
get
no
comfort
out
of
the
sanitary
district
case
but
i
thought
it
advisable
to
explain
it
and
--
and
deflate
if
i
may,
the
argument
of
the
government.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
13.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
mr.
justice
holmes
did
that.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
we
contend
that
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
no.
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
we
contend
that
while
there
maybe
a
construction
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
is
no
obstruction.
there
maybe
an
obstruction
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
there
is
no
obstruction
as
a
matter
of
law
because
there
must
be
a
specific
delegation
of
authority
by
congress
to
the
secretary
of
war
and
chief
of
engineers,
regulating
suspended
solids
in
our
process.
there
is
no
such
specific
authorization
in
the
case
about
it.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
no.
i
--
i
submit,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
that
is
not
true.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
i
think
he
could
if
he
had
the
power
but
he
has
not
the
power
because
as
i
have
explained,
the
--
the
word
“obstruction”
in
the
first
clause
of
section
10
relates
back
to
section
9
and
refers
to
any
bridge,
dam,
causeway
or
so
forth.
and
it's
that
type
of
obstruction
that
is
referred
to
in
the
first
clause
of
section
10.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
and
that
requires
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
that
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes,
and
they
all
issued
permits
regulating
the
amount
of
the
withdrawal.
now
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
the
obstruction
that
they
found
was
that
the
controlling
works
were
interfering
with
navigation.
the
works
of
the
sanitary
district
in
withdrawing
the
water,
there
is
a
relation.
but
when
mr.
justice
holmes
in
--
in
281,
in
wisconsin
versus
illinois,
talked
about
the
situation
he
made
no
reference
to
obstruction
whatsoever.
and
--
and
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
they
were
rights
of
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
yes,
that
is
true.
my
time
is
expiring.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
well,
we
--
we
contend
of
course
that
it
is
not
an
obstruction
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
--
but
if
it
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
structure
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
we
contend
that
section
10
would
not
apply,
mr.
justice
brennan
for
this
reason.
because
the
section
13
or
section
407
specifically
authorizes
the
respondents
to
do
what
they're
doing
and
therefore,
section
10
is
irrelevant.
we
--
we
have
delegated
to
us
by
congress,
by
the
provisions
of
section
13.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
they're
entitled
to
the
relief
or
--
or
to
--
to
no
relief
as
far
as
the
respondents
are
concerned
because
by
section
13,
we
are
specifically
authorized
to
do
what
we're
doing.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
oh,
no.
oh
definitely
not.
certainly,
flue
dust
in
the
river
cannot
be
a
structure.
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
the
government
has
--
you
mean
with
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
--
respect
to
the
respondents?
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
the
government
has
no
remedy
by
injunction
because
--
mr.
paul
r.
conaghan
what
mr.
justice?
mr.
