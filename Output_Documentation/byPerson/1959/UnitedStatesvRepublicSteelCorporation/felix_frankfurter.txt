sections
10
and
what
mr.
solicitor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
--
did
i
rightly
infer
from
what
you've
said
that
no
questions
of
fact
or
findings
etcetera
before
us,
except
so
far
as
they
are
conceded
in
the
case
fundamentally
turns
one
on
the
construction
of
10
and
13?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
secondly,
the
--
the
question
as
to
decree,
the
propriety
of
that
decree
that
the
government
has?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
the
substantive
--
the
substantive
issues
turn
on
construction
of
sections
10
and
13
of
the
1899
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
plus
the
question
whether
any
bearing
that
section
10
of
the
1890
act
had
of
the
derivative
problem,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
hypothetically
if
we
should
reverse
it,
you'll
have
to
go
back
on
those
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
guess
one
focused
on
what
--
on
what
is
that
focused
on
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
purposes
of
--
for
purpose
--
now,
in
answers
to
the
question,
for
purposes
of
dealing
with
10
and
13
intelligently
or
ultimately,
may
one
accept
the
findings
of
--
the
finding
should
any
background
understanding
or
what
kind
of
thing
we're
dealing
with
here
or
not.
or
is
it
just
a
blank
and
i
(inaudible)
view
what
i
thought
to
be
considering
with
that
10
and
13
justify
the
claims
that
you
made
in
your
original
complaint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
we
can
--
we
can
say
that
assuming
these
kind
of
deposits,
assume
their
consequence
or
effect
brings
them
within
10
or
13.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
you
--
making
mess
to
the
argument,
is
rather
than
what
has
congress
had
said
and
how
could
you,
about
the
way
of
an
injunction
that
congress
does
create
something,
then,
the
relief
is
limited
to
what
it
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
saying
that
he
meant
with
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you
and
you
go
on
(inaudible)
1890,
only
when
it
comes
to
the
remedy
of
substantive
law,
you'll
stand
on
what
exactly
was
insufficient
and
adequate
there
on
the
1899,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
engaged
--
that's
allowed
you
very
far
from
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
leading
this
question
of
remedy,
etcetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
have
you
have
you
illuminate,
if
you
will
for
me
what
is
--
i
think
an
(inaudible)
of
the
1899
act
which
exquisitely
gives
somebody
by
way
of
injunction
to
violations
of
provisions
9,
10
and
11.
and
you
need
to
move
over
to
section
16,
another
remedial
provision
that
does
not
include
the
remedy
of
injunction
for
violations
of
section
13,
14
and
15.
now,
if
only
a
printed
section
13
having
gone
to
--
i
find
that
14
deals
with
--
13
deals
with
reference
broadly
speaking,
14
deals
with
the
placement
and
things
like
that
and
15
deals
with
obstruction
to
--
floating
timbers
and
--
and
vessels
and
so
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
indicate
why
it
was
that
congress
ask
to
--
9,
10
and
11
specifically
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
move
for
an
injunction
when
it
comes
to
13,
14
and
15,
they
gave
other
remedies
such
as
libeling
the
vessel
etc
was
left
out
(inaudible)
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
court
deny
its
power
to
issue
an
injunction
or
did
it
say,
considering
the
fact
that
you
have
self
remedy,
no
use
of
asking
us
for
a
mandatory
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
denied
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
haven't
read
either
of
the
briefs,
but
if
--
if
congress
had
made
no
provision
for
an
injunction,
it
said
nothing
about
an
injunction,
i
should
find
it
very
difficult
to
deny
the
power
of
equity
to
issue
an
injunction
would
make
effective
the
prohibition
of
the
statute
and
so,
the
argument
must
mean
that
by
a
particularizing,
there
is
a
limitation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
also
argued
--
you
argued
for
the
retention
of
what
would
be
there,
congress
hasn't
specified?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
we
can
all
start
including
the
--
the
respondent
that
the
1899
act
simply
was
meant
to
stiffen
the
control
of
the
dealing
with
obstructions
to
navigation.
but
that
a
steady
progression
in
the
--
in
the
laws
as
you
indicated,
in
the
beginning
congress
dealt
with
each
case
ad
hoc.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
came
1890
which
was
a
very
inadequate
statute
in
part
and
the
experience
under
that,
it
got
1899
which
meant
to
enlarge
the
grip
of
control
and
not
to
relax
it.
is
that
a
fair
summary
of
the
history?

justice

but
that's
a
--
sections
13,
14
and
15.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
other
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
have
to
go
beyond
that,
if
may
suggest,
not
merely
that
it
isn't
adequate,
but
that
the
--
that
the
attitude
of
congress
as
revealed
by
legislation
and
the
background
of
it
was
that
they
were
concerned
with
--
with
affirmative
relief
and
not
putting
people
in
jail
or
inadequate
fine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
again
very
hypothetically,
an
injunction
was
originally
granted
by
judge
(inaudible)
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
to
--
on
the
assumption
that
he
is
correct,
the
government
collects
under
substantive
law,
this
one
anticipates,
do
we
have
to
pass
on
the
scope
of
the
injunction?
is
that
or
would
that
be
remitted
to
the
court
of
appeals?
is
that
in
controversy
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
other
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
(inaudible)
because
it
would
be
remitted
in
--
you
know
that
has
been
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
that
would
open
up
--
however
(voice

--
justice
felix

thank
you
very
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
--
justice
felix

forgive
me
--
forgive
me
mr.
jackson,
but
i
thought,
you
stated
if
i
may
say
so
impressively
a
little
while
ago
that
you
urge
on
us
strongly
the
consideration
that
where
a
congress
comes
out
a
little
sirloin
from
the
pole,
that's
all
it
serving
up
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
why
did
you
say
that
you
--
why
did
you
just
answer
to
justice
harlan
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
do
not
read
of
10.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
of
course
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me,
let
me
understand
it
clearly.
you
do
say
that
section
10
of
the
1899
act
has
no
relevance
to
this
that
the
government's
feel
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
whatever
right
it
has
--
rights
it
has,
it
must
derive
from
section
13
dealing
with
refuse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
--
if
you
say
coming
to
it,
you
--
you
--
this
is
rebuttal
to
the
government's
argument,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
from
your
point
of
view,
your
argument
is
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
that
light
indicated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
reasons
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
jackson,
is
your
--
is
your
associate
going
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
whether
the
inherent
right
of
equity
to
grant
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
wholly
apart
from
the
statutory
limitation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
cause
of
action,
but
i'm
talking
assuming
there's
a
cause
of
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
--
assuming
that
congress
had
said
nothing,
i
should
describe
if
you
deny
that
then
there
would
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
distributed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
in
the
question
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
case
of
bellingham.
unless
i
misunderstood
mr.
jackson's
fear
argument
if
the
contention
is
that
this
case
--
that
section
10
of
the
1899
act
is
irrelevant
to
the
issues
in
this
case
and
that
whatever
rights
the
government
has
or
may
assert,
it
must
assert
under
12?
under
the
13
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
sanitary
case
involves
the
withdrawal
of
water,
an
injunction
against
it.
i
can
well
understand
your
last
remark
to
the
chief
justice
that
if
congress
specifically
deals
to
the
question
of
commerce
in
regulation
of
waters
that
are
navigable
in
interstate
commerce,
that's
that.
and
of
course
that
is
--
that
was
the
practice
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
from
the
beginning
down
trough
1890s
willfully
speaking.
it
has
ad
hoc
specific
legislation
dealing
with
specific
rivers
and
specific
bridges
and
specific
booms
and
the
rest
of
it?
but
the
sanitary
case
granting
or
sustaining
an
injunc
--
granting
an
injunction
to
the
government
rest
the
power
to
issue
such
an
injunction
on
12,
on
--
on
the
violation
of
section
10.
and
section
10
deals
with
obstruction.
and
therefore
the
withdrawal
of
water
as
i
follow
the
argument
of
the
case
in
its
implication,
the
withdrawal
of
water
constituted
an
obstruction.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
assume
this
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
i
want
to
know
why
the
deposits
of
--
of
this
noxious
or
undesirable
or
obstructing
--
these
obstructing
materials.
why
they
may
not
be
deemed
an
obstruction
in
the
same
way
which
withdrawal
of
water
deemed
an
obstruction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
may
i
just?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
is
an
obstruction,
if
--
if
it
does
come
--
if
this
situation
comes
within
section
10,
then
there
is
no
difficulty
about
the
power
to
grant
an
injunction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
follows?
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
because
enough
to
enlighten
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
this
--
the
secretary
of
war
may
have
--
had
followed
in
the
section
10
to
sanction
everything
that
is
complained
of
against
the
respondent,
is
that
not
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
secretary
of
war
couldn't
sanction
what
you've
been
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
was
--
was
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
that
true
of
the
sanitary
case?
i
thought
the
obstruction,
the
only
obstruction
that
--
that
existed
there
was
found
there
by
successive
secretary
of
the
war
or
the
obstruction
due
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
waters
beginning
with
secretary
routes
down
to
the
other
secretaries
that
their
routes
that
we'd
have
in
this
seems
--
they
all
have
a
sharing
in
this
--
as
it
that
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
but
the
--
the
obstruction
which
they
found
and
i
think
i
speak
by
the
books.
the
obstruction
which
they
found
was
the
lowering
of
the
water
levels?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
the
interstate
--
that
was
an
interstate
route?
justice
felix
frankfurter
again
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
again,
has
some
other
aspects
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
mr.
conaghan,
his
argument
is
that
while
there
was
a
practical
factual
obstruction
to
the
withdrawal
of
water,
that
was
incident
to
works
to
physical
obstruction.
and
therefore,
to
the
physical
obstructions
clearly
would
intend
--
it
could
have
been
incident
to
abating
that
nuisance,
if
i
may
use
that
terms,
also
prohibits
the
withdrawal
of
water.
i
think
that
was
his
argument,
so
that
you
haven't
got
withdrawal
of
water
simplicity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
through
those
works
they
could
withdraw
x
or
x-y?
