mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
say
preliminary
the
request
of
mr.
w.s.
bodman,
who
is
here
and
he
is
counsel
for
respondent,
international
harvester
company,
that
in
view
of
the
court's
reluctance
to
permit
three
counsel
to
argue
on
one
side
although
separate
cases,
he
waives
his
right
to
do
so
and
will
not
participate
in
the
oral
argument,
but
rely
upon
his
brief
and
he
hopes
upon
arguments
of
counsel
for
the
other
respondents.
we
may
wish
to
withdraw
that
later.[laughter]
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
briefly
to
set
out
my
conception
of
what
is
before
this
court
on
certiorari
in
this
case.
and
sufficient
of
the
factual
segment,
so
as
to
make
intelligible
the
discussion
of
the
statutes
which
are
involved.
as
has
been
said,
the
government
brought
an
action
in
which
it
alleged
that
each
of
the
respondents
violated
section
9
and
section
13
of
the
r
&
h
act
of
1899
and
prayed
for
injunctive
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
establish
a
violation
of
either
section
10
or
section
13
of
the
1899
act
and
then
is
a
cumulative
ground
of
decision
that
even
if
a
violation
of
either
section
had
been
established,
the
remedies
created
by
congress
for
the
violation
of
those
sections
are
severally
exclusive
and
do
not
authorize
petitioner
to
maintain
any
civil
action
on
this
relation
to
this
subject
matter.
now,
very
briefly,
the
respondent's
own
plant
from
the
calumet
river
and
if
in
--
of
interest,
their
general
location
is
shown
on
the
map,
it's
back
of
the
international
harvester
company
brief.
the
--
and
interlake
iron
corporation
which
happens
to
be
my
client,
operates
coke
ovens
and
two
blast
furnaces
to
produce
pig
iron
for
the
merchant
trade.
in
the
operation
of
the
coke
ovens
and
the
blast
furnaces,
it
withdraws
water
from
the
calumet
river
which
already
contains
some
suspended
solids.
in
these
operations
unavoidably,
coke
ovens
create
some
coke
breeze
and
blast
furnace
creates
some
flue
dust.
each
consists
principally
of
very
fine
particles
and
so
far
as
here,
a
material
is
very
fine,
many
of
them
being
so
small
that
they
cannot
be
seen
with
the
aid
of
an
ordinary
microscope.
now,
each
of
these
products
are
valuable,
they
have
commercial
value
and
interlake
uses
numerous
processes
and
various
equipment
to
recover
all
of
these
coke
breeze
and
flue
dust
to
the
greatest
practical
extent,
from
the
water
before
it
throws
back
through
its
sewers
into
the
calumet
river.
now,
some
of
this
small
amount
of
this
very
fine
material,
it
cannot
practically
be
recovered
from
the
water
before
it
returns.
so,
it
--
and
it
is
carried
in
suspension
or
a
solution
depending
upon
your
technical
definition
of
terms
and
some
of
it
may
well
deposit
at
unforeseeable
times
in
unknown
places,
either
in
the
privately
owned
slip
adjacent
to
the
plant
in
the
river,
but
not
within
the
navigation
channel
and
probably
some
of
it
in
the
navigation
channel.
now,
interlake
regularly
dredges
its
private
slip
and
in
the
part
of
its
plant
and
the
--
however,
the
net
result
is
for
the
purposes
of
the
questions
here
presented,
that
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said,
the
effluent
or
outflow
from
the
sewers
of
these
respondents
is
99
--
just
more
98%
water.
now,
i
should
say
that
the
other
respondents,
international
harvester
and
republic
steel
corporation
also
operates
coke
ovens
and
blast
furnaces
to
produces
pig
iron
for
their
own
use,
in
their
own
plants
which
they
then
convert
into
steel
and
into
some
steel
products.
and
as
appears
from
my
map,
the
very
large
plant
of
u.s.
steel
and
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
are
located
at
the
lake,
which
since
chicago
reversed
the
calumet
river,
is
now
the
source
instead
of
the
mouth,
so
that
any
material
from
those
plants
would
pass
downstream
towards
the
plants
of
the
respective
respondents.
now
then,
in
our
view,
the
simple
question
is
whether
the
discharge
of
sewer
outflow
or
effluent
of
which
99
--
just
more
98%
is
water,
but
which
carry
some
small
amount
of
very
fine
materials
that
may
settle
out
admittedly,
as
here
or
there,
is
a
violation
of
section
9
or
section
13
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
should
say
10,
10
and
13.
i
thank
you.
later,
one
side
of
the
moment,
the
question
of
what
remedy
if
any,
would
be
available
in
the
event
the
petitioner
had
established
a
violation
of
either
section.
now,
in
order
to
--
to
--
before
discussing
these
specific
statutes,
i
should
like
to
mention
some
considerations.
something
of
the
background
upon
which
i
believe
this
--
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
and
the
material
sections
must
be
construed.
first,
as
i
shall
show
a
little
later,
the
river
and
harbors
act
of
march
4,
1899
was
a
comprehensive
and
all
inclusive
revision
of
all
general
laws
with
minor
exceptions
that
i
will
mention
later,
for
the
protection
of
navigable
waters.
in
which
the
congress
carefully
segregated
the
different
segments
of
the
old
river
problem,
its
different
process
in
particular
sections
and
made
a
similarly
discriminating
choice
of
remedies.
now,
when
congress
enacted
these
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
march
3,
1899,
it
was
exercising
its
exclusive
constitutional
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
of
our
constitution,
to
balance
the
national
interest
in
navigation
and
non-navigation
uses
of
our
navigable
waters.
concededly,
throughout
the
history
of
our
country,
in
1899
and
even
today,
the
--
the
non-navigable
--
navigation,
uses
of
navigable
waters
for
domestic
use,
for
manufacture
and
a
host
of
other
purposes,
have
been
essential
to
the
development
and
the
maintenance
of
our
national
economy
and
incidentally
to
the
development
and
maintenance
of
the
tax
resources
upon
which
both
national
and
local
governments
could
depend.
now,
i
think
it
--
it
necessarily
--
it
necessarily
follows
that
in
undertaking
such
a
problem,
congress
necessarily
segregated
the
different
process.
provided
different
regulations,
provided
different
remedies
and
as
i
shall
try
to
show
later,
there
is
no
room
for
trying
to
transpose,
draft
the
one
section
of
--
of
a
substantive
section
on
another,
one
remedy
upon
another
remedy.
then,
we
say
one
word
about
the
--
section
10
of
the
act
of
1890,
works
with
great
deference
in
certainly,
all
respect,
i
say
that
the
petitioner
here
has
been
forced
into
the
untenable
propositions
for
our
position
of
contending
that
section
10
of
the
act
of
1890
was
not
repealed,
because
it
suddenly
discovered
the
even
if
it
could
prove
a
violation
of
section
10
of
the
act
of
1899,
it
had
--
the
congress
had
not
provided
the
equitable
remedy
which
it
was
seeking.
now
later,
i
would
like
to
--
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
that
a
little
further.
then,
i
--
i
know
--
i
want
to
turn
to
--
well,
i
want
to
say
one
other
thing,
quite
inadvertently
i'm
sure,
the
solicitor
general
overstated
what
he
conceived
to
be
the
degree
of
agreed
facts.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
are
no
agreed
facts
except
that
we
operate
the
plants
that
we
--
return
the
water
the
way
that
we
have
specified
and
that
so
much
of
it
is
water,
as
the
solicitor
general
stated
himself
on
--
in
his
argument.
now,
there
is
no
--
there's
a
question
of
settleable
solids.
anything
in
suspension
most
--
well,
deposit
sometime
--
it's
just
a
question
of
time
--
just
the
question
of
condition
and
there
is
as
far
as
i
have
ever
found,
no
water
known
to
nature
in
a
pristine
forest,
which
does
not
carry
some
solids
in
suspension.
now,
these
very
fine
particles
which
are
carried
in
the
sewer
outflows
of
these
respondents
are
inert.
they
are
not
percussible.
and
to
speak
about
how
the
sewage
in
the
light
disappears,
is
wholly
irrelevant
and
--
and
i
--
if
i
may,
with
diffidence
say
incorrect.
it
is
true
that
if
you
discharge
percussible
material
into
flowing
water,
it
will
oxidize
that
material
so
that
it
will
no
longer
be
percussible,
noxious
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
percussible.
i
think,
it
means,
it
will
rot,
but
(inaudible)
and
excuse
me,
if
i
am,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
there's
nothing
left
of
it,
it
means
that
the
materials
which
have
been
purified
from
the
standpoint
of
public
health,
from
the
standpoint
of
offensive
--
you
know,
(inaudible)
to
the
public,
that
is
where
they
give
off
bad
odors
and
so
forth,
will
have
disappeared.
now,
i
come
to
the
first
proposition.
i
only
want
to
spend
a
minute
on
it,
because
i
think
it's
tied
too
closely
to
the
others.
in
--
we
contend
first
that
section
13
of
the
1899
act
is
the
only
such
--
which
has
any
application
to
the
respondents'
acts.
and
that
section
10
of
the
1899
act
is
wholly
inapplicable.
the
--
this
--
the
act
of
1899
was
not
only
a
comprehensive,
but
all
inclusive
revision,
but
it
was
made
with
great
care.
the
--
the
congress
directed
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
army
engineers
in
1896
to
--
to
review
all
of
the
general
laws
which
had
been
passed
from
time
to
time
for
the
protection
of
navigable
waters.
you
report
them
to
the
same
and
their
recommendations
as
revision
emendates
in
our
enlargement
of
the
laws
as
he
thought
at
that
cases.
now,
that
was
done
and
the
report
was
made
on
february
13,
1897.
and
the
statute
which
in
--
the
graft
statute
which
in
large
part,
became
the
act
of
1899,
was
before
the
members
of
congress
for
over
two
years.
this
was
not
any
hasty
act.
incidentally,
it
explains
perhaps
the
limit
on
repeal
because
the
secretary
recommended
that
there
be
no
change
made
in
two
existing
laws
since
they
had
already
been
construed
by
the
courts
and
regulations
have
been
promulgated
by
the
department
under
them,
they
authorized
regulations
for
certain
purposes.
of
course,
it
would
be
singular
indeed
to
find
that
the
congress
having
given
this
one
reason
for
asking
this
careful
and
comprehensive
revision
of
all
the
general
laws
to
be
made.
there
should
--
thereafter,
provides
that
all
of
the
--
one
--
and
the
reason
--
for
the
reason
that
they
had
been
enacted
at
various
times,
are
difficult
to
locate
and
so
forth,
that
it
should
then
enact
a
new
set
of
laws
on
the
same
subject
and
declare
however
that
you
had
to
look
at
all
of
the
old
laws
scattered
throughout
the
statutes
to
see
whether
or
not
they
were
not
also
in
effect.
it
would
--
i
--
it
seems
to
me,
have
changed
confusion
to
chaos.
now
then,
i'm
going
--
i
want
to
know
briefly
of
--
of
the
construction
of
section
13
of
the
--
of
the
1899
act.
that
is
quoted
at
page
27
of
the
brief
as
far
as
i
think
--
as
i
believe
to
be
relevant,
but
is
quoted
in
full
on
pages
48
and
49
of
the
appendix
a
to
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
yes.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
my
reason
i
--
should've
added
is
this.
the
question
here
involves
the
discharge
or
deposit
of
refuse
matter
into
navigable
water.
section
13
of
the
1899
act
regulates
that
subject
matter
in
detail
and
comprehensively.
section
10
of
the
1899
act
does
not
in
my
opinion
deal
with
that
subject
matter
at
all.
but
if
it
did
--
if
you
can
say
that
the
--
the
generality
of
its
language
in
a
broadest
stream
might
be
held
to
encompass
to
discharge
of
or
deposit
of
refuse
matter.
the
settled
principle
as
i
understand
it
is
that
in
the
same
statute,
a
section
in
which
congress
had
expressly
and
specifically
regulated
one
segment
of
the
overall
subject
matter,
is
the
exclusive
and
controlling
regulation
of
that
facet
of
the
subject
matter
even
though
there
maybe
another
section
with
such
general
language
that
it
could
be
construed
to
encompass
the
specific
section.
i
think
it
--
the
reasoning
is
further
emphasized
by
bearing
in
mind
constantly
that
the
congress
was
here
balancing
the
national
interest
in
navigation
and
non-navigation
use
and
as
i
hope
to
show
more
point,
a
little
discussion
of
section
13.
that
was
a
particular
segment
of
the
problem
which
could
not
be
dealt
within
generalized
language
and
still
come
out
with
what
congress
believed
to
be
a
reasonably
sound
balance
between
the
navigation
and
non-navigation
interest.
now
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
certainly,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well
--
i
--
i
was
wondering,
i
can
cover
that
after
13,
but
i
--
i
will
decide
to
take
it
up
first
even
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
read
it
out
the
picture.
well
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
--
let
us
look
at
section
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i'm
afraid
i
misunderstood,
but
we
do
--
we
do
contend
that
it's
wholly
inapplicable
to
this
case.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
but
i
perhaps
misunderstood
your
honor,
and
thought
you
might
be
inquiring
whether
in
that
view,
it
was
left
--
was
no
applicable
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
and
i
--
don't
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
as
you
prefer,
i
would
like
to
go
to
13,
because
i
think
it
follows
back
--
and
better
after,
but
i
take
the
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i
--
i'm
sure
they
do
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
that
is
so
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
that
is
the
--
that
is
exactly
our
position,
sir.
well,
coming
to
such
intent
of
course,
now
and
--
i
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
it
is
really,
yes.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
my
point
of
view,
i
discuss
13
first,
because
i
think
it's
the
applicable
one
--
so
we
don't
violate
it
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
and
then
i
would
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
very
well,
sir.
you're
very
gracious.
well,
section
13
which
is
quoted
in
full
on
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief
on
pages
48-9,
has
a
--
one
of
my
contentions
to
this
language.
now,
the
--
the
act
that
a
section
declares
that
it
shall
not
be
lawful
to
discharge
or
deposit
and
so
forth,
refuse
matter.
now,
i
direct
attention
--
invite
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
prohibition
with
respect
to
the
sewers
from
which
the
waste
matter
may
come,
is
all
inclusive
and
there
is
no
basis
for
carving
anything
out
of
that
prohibition,
such
as
domestic
sewage.
then
in
particular,
of
course,
it
mentions
particularly
establishment
or
mill
of
any
kind
of
manufacturing
plant.
then,
the
language
follows
any
refuse
matter
of
any
kind
or
description,
whatever.
now,
that
language
is
also
sweeping
an
inclusive.
now,
we
then
come
to
this
significant
language,
other
than
that
point
from
streets
and
sewers
and
passing
there
from
--
in
a
liquid
state.
first,
i
have
observed
that
that
exception
is
--
as
the
all
inclusive
and
sweeping
as
--
as
the
language
with
respect
to
the
source
of
the
refuse
matter
and
the
kind
of
refuse
matter.
i
also
invite
attention
to
the
fact
that
admittedly,
everything
which
falls
within
that
exception
is
not
a
violation
of
section
13
and
i
submit
cannot
be
a
violation
of
any
other
section.
now
then,
we
come
to
this
--
and
that's
when
about
the
bank
provision
about
deposits
on
the
bank
are
not
here
involved.
we
have
also
provision
about
government
work
not
here
involved.
now,
reference
has
been
made
to
--
to
the
matter
of
the
certain
permits
under
certain
conditions.
i
--
i
reject
the
solicitor
general's
construction
of
that
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
plainly
has
no
application
to
the
language
which
i
--
from
which
i
quoted
in
regard
to
the
general
prohibition.
secondly,
in
the
case
of
any
discharge
or
deposit
which
comes
within
the
exception
created
by
the
congress,
manifestly,
there
can
be
no
violation
of
the
section
and
there
can
be
no
need
for
a
permit
and
obviously
congress
didn't
authorized
the
permit
where
it
was
wholly
unnecessary.
now
then,
in
the
court
below,
the
government
was
faced
with
a
problem
here
seriously.
and
there,
they
urged
upon
the
lower
court
that
this
exception
included
only
a
--
only
sewer
outflows
or
streets
runoffs,
which
did
not
contain
any
material
in
suspension
or
anything
of
that
--
other
than
water
which
was
not
impermanent
solution.
on
our
course
manifestly,
such
a
construction
would
render
the
exception
inapplicable
to
any
new
sewer
outflow
or
street
runoff
and
i
believe
to
any
known
natural
stream,
even
though
it
would
be
in
the
wilds
of
canada
where
as
yet,
there
has
been
little
contamination,
if
any,
from
civilization.
or
obviously,
that
you
could
hardly
expect
that
congress
intended
--
put
in
the
exception
for
nothing.
the
next
proposition
is
that
the
congress
was
exercising
its
exclusive
constitutional
authority
to
balance
the
national
and
non-national
interest
in
the
uses
of
navigable
water.
and
under
these
facts
as
they
existed
in
1899
and
as
they
exist
today,
such
an
extreme
statute
as
would
be
represented
by
the
construction
claimed
by
the
petitioner,
would
bring
to
a
standstill,
industrial
activity
in
both
urban
and
rural
life.
these
--
these
consequences
to
the
economy
would
be
hard
to
tell.
now,
a
great
problem,
great
view
is
made
to
the
fact
that
there
maybe
some
of
these
deposits
and
that
might
somehow
and
some
unknown
extent,
increase
the
normal
and
conceding
it
isn't
normal,
annual
or
periodic
costs
of
maintenance
dredging,
our
maintenance
cost
which
is
incident
to
practically
all
the
navigational
improvements
and
particularly
on
rivers
where
they
are
made
by
enlarging
a
natural
channel.
now
of
course,
the
obvious
answer
to
that
is
that
the
congress
must
have
concluded
either
that
it
would
be
equitable
for
the
government
to
gain
and
to
bear
any
increase
in
maintenance
dredging,
if
there
might
be,
or
that
the
alternative
was
to
--
would
--
would
create
chaos,
would
be
disastrous
from
the
standpoint
of
the
national
economy.
no
one
argues
that
the
congress
could
not
completely
shut
down
these
plants
tomorrow,
which
can
operate
only
by
discharging
these
--
these
effluence
into
these
things,
but
we
do
not
believe
the
congress
did
or
ever
will
exercise
any
such
--
make
any
such
arbitrary
exercise
of
its
plenary
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
now
then,
as
i've
--
am
i
--
should
i
be
out
of
here,
(inaudible)
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
oh,
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
oh
well,
i
--
mr.
--
i
told
you
mr.
conaghan
may
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
thought
it's
like
a
double
--
just
to
add
a
--
a
little
bit
here.
now
then,
they
have
in
this
court
for
the
first
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
pardon,
sir.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
yes.
a
lot
of
our
associates
has
the
time
now
to
say
--
i
can
say
it
in
two
three
sentences,
if
i
made
in
the
brief,
but
i
don't
know
if
i
can,
but
may
i
try?
at
his
expense
that
--
in
--
in
the
--
in
this
court
for
the
first
time,
the
petitioner
said,
“well,
that
exception
obviously,
it
claims
from
legislative
history,
if
i
may
say
because
if
they
keep
rolling
on,
they
acquire
a
steam
in
their
brief
that
that
referred
only
to
domestic
sewers.
now,
as
i‘ve
pointed
out,
the
all
inclusive
language
with
respect
to
the
sewers
of
any
waste,
with
respect
to
the
character
of
any
waste
and
the
similarly
inclusive
--
all
inclusive
language
of
the
exception
itself,
does
not
admit
of
any
such
refinement
as
that.
and
furthermore,
the
--
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
i
have
seen
in
any
brief
filed
in
any
court
or
that
any
--
i
could
find
that
anyone
who's
willing
to
take
up
the
burden
for
me
to
find
that
whatever
it
suggests
that
the
--
congress
had
any
such
an
intent,
i
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
your
honor
--
i
should
--
i've
promised
to
do
that,
but
i
--
became
through
for
both
and
so
i'll
have
to
ask
him
to
rely
up
--
i'm
kind
of
in
to
do
that,
your
honor.
i
may
say
only
in
passing
that
it
seemed
--
just
one
observation,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
inherent
power
of
the
course
of
equity,
there's
no
common
law
cause
of
action
that
can
deal
with
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
oh,
assuming
there's
a
cause
of
action.
i
--
assuming
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
if
the
congress
had
done
nothing
except
to
create
prohibitory
regulations,
i
would
suspect
that
the
court
might
reasonably
infer.
that
congress
expected
them
to
shape
the
remedy,
law
or
equity,
which
they
deemed
appropriate
to
that
end.
now,
here
however,
you
see
the
difference
--
i'll
--
i'll
cite
you
their
language,
excuse
me.
but
here,
your
honors,
we
have
two
things,
one,
statute
1890
and
some
others,
in
which
at
various
places,
there
were
criminal
penalties,
equitable
remedies.
then
they
come
to
the
act
of
1899
or
refine
that
congress
has
shifted
classifications
--
has
changed
the
remedies
entirely
and
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
yes,
right.
and
it
hasn't
overlooked
them
both,
because
it's
--
it's
a
--
prototype
had
them
and
because
it's
got
them
here
in
this
case.
and
then,
of
course,
our
position
is
that
--
that
the
attorney
general
to
maintain
in
the
action
that
the
united
states
has,
but
that
doesn't
enlarge
the
action
of
the
united
states
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
isn't
it
--
well,
i
could
impress
because
i
don't
know
of
this
sort
of
the
uncertainty
is
permissible
but,
you
say
a
word
because
it's
closing
--
closing
time
and
ending
time.
about
section
10,
now
that
--
this
is
purely
defensive
as
justice
frankfurter
has
indicated.
i
mean
by
that,
if
we
say
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
but
in
explanation
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
although
it's
a
little
more
complicated
for
that,
but
that
--
but
that
was
coming
down
essentially
do
that.
the
first
was
cause
of
action
of
any
kind
except
for
a
statute.
congress
created
that.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
congress
selected
the
remedy.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
if
selection
of
remedies
had
an
equally
important
bearing
upon
it's
balancing
of
the
national
interest
in
navigation
and
non-navigation,
that
uses
of
navigable
waters.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
that's
right.
i
think
they
--
they
had
--
in
other
words
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i
--
i
think
in
a
--
in
many
cases,
i
would
not
sir,
if
you
might
have
such
a
clear
indication
in
legislative
history
that
they
limited
it
to
that,
but
here,
i
would
suggest
that
in
--
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
to
render
late,
that
if
the
congress
had
provided
no
remedy
or
perhaps
provided
nothing
but
a
criminal
offense,
it
would
be
arguable,
if
they
expected
the
court
to
exercise
its
common
law
powers
or
--
i
mean,
remedies
and
equitable
remedies,
but
that
is
foreclosed
as
we
see
it
here.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
that's
right.
well,
it
also
presides
the
remedy
where
--
if
--
for
the
employee
violation
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i
may
say
just
on
word,
because
i
have
some
familiarity
with
that
situation,
having
been
in
good
deal
of
the
early
litigation.
the
sanitary
district
case
involved
a
great
system
of
--
of
that
district
created
by
state
statutes
designed
to
divert
the
sanitary
and
--
and
trade
waste
of
the
metropolitan
area
into
the
mississippi
watershed.
now,
that
plan
involved
the
planned
excavation
of
the
entire
river
--
chicago
river,
its
south
port,
the
erection
of
numerous
structures
and
bridges
and
the
reversal
of
its
natural
flow
and
hydraulic
radiance
and
with
water
from
lake
michigan.
the
--
similarly,
the
--
before
the
sanitary
district
case
was
decided,
it
involved
--
in
the
excavation
of
the
entire
channel
of
the
calumet
river.
the
reversal
of
its
national
flow
and
hydraulic
radiance
so
that
it
would
be
diverted
into
the
sanitary
and
ship
canal,
advanced
into
the
other
watershed.
now,
none
of
those
things
--
they
were
not
kind
of
things
are
covered
by
section
13,
they
were
planned
excavations
of
the
greatest
magnitude
and
clearly
could
not
be
done
under
the
third
--
what
i
call
the
third
clause
of
section
10,
except
pursuant
to
a
permit.
now,
as
this
court
(inaudible)
held
the
power
to
prove
includes
the
power
to
disapprove,
i
may
have
gotten
in
reverse,
anyway
the
power
to
improve
in
--
disapprove
includes
the
power
to
improve
--
approve
on
condition.
and
those
permits
beginning
back
in
1896,
that's
the
30-year
administrative
construction
that
that
--
this
court
spoke
of
in
the
opinion.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
yes.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
yes.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
on
how
to
explain
why
i
don't
think
why
it
was.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well--
i
--
it
did
in
--
in
one
--
in
one
round
of
the
state
action,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
any
different
under
section
10
because
all
of
these
permits,
they
couldn't
--
they
--
they
were
conditions
they
couldn't
withdraw
water
except
when
and
to
the
extent
they
should
be
authorized
by
the
secretary
of
war
or
congress.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
now
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
yes.
