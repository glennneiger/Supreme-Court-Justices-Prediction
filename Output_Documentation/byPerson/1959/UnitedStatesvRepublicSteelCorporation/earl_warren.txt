chief

which
reads
this
--
it
reads
how?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
language
in
that
section
applies
more
to
the
state
of
facts
you've
just
related
and
does
the
language
of
the
same
section
applied
to
u.s.
situation?
take
the
specific
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
language,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
you
say
there's
no
language
that
authorizes
this
action
so
far
as
you're
concerned.
now,
what
specific
language
in
that
section
authorized
or
brought
the
court
to
this
conclusion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
what's
specific
language
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
there
is
applicable
to
that
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
have
it
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
have
a
condition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
in
that
sanitary
case,
the
government
had
authorized
that
canal.
the
only
--
the
only
thing
they
were
doing
was
taking
more
water
than
the
government
authorizes
in
that
gate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
that
they
have
brought
any
additional
works
in
the
case,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
that?
is
that
sanitary
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
he
doing
was
in
--
on
the
same
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
the
most
important
part
of
mr.
justice
holmes'
decision
on
that
point
is
to
be
found
on
page
428,
this
proceeding
which
you
have
--
have
said
in
--
on
429
beginning
with
that
--
beginning
with
that
paragraph
on
--
concerning
section
10
on
page
428?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
he
used
the
other
--
isn't
the
other
just
what
you
had
in
29
just
detail
on
the
trade?
isn't
what
he
really
said
incorporated
in
page
428
there
in
that
paragraph
that
begins
with
the
discussion
of
section
10?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
get
back
to
your
analysis
of
the
sanitary
district
case.
i
--
i
didn't
get
my
mind
cleared
up
on
--
on
that.
as
i
--
i
understood
you,
the
magic
word
in
--
in
justice
homes'
opinion
was
condition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
condition,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
want
--
i
--
i'd
like
to
know
what
language
if
you
get
to
in
--
in
that
case,
you
get
comfort
from
indiscriminating
as
between
the
facts
in
your
case
and
the
facts
in
that
case,
so
that
in
the
one
case
we
were
dealing
with
a
condition
and
in
your
case
we
are
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
would
authorize
the
works,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
not?
