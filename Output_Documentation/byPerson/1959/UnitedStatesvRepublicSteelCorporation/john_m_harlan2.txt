justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that,
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
gotten
significance
in
my
--
that
in
the
1890
--
in
the
1890
act,
the
obstruction
clause
on
which
you
rely
was
in
a
remedial
provision
or
had
its
own
remedial
provision
including
the
injunction
provision.
and
that
in
the
1899
act
when
they
read
that
--
the
sections,
the
remedial
provisions
were
lifted
out
--
what
had
been
section
10
and
stuck
into
what
is
section
6
or
something
or
other
and
then
qualified
in
their
application
to
the
other
section,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
maybe
anticipating
the
--
another
branch
of
your
case,
but
i
want
to
see
if
i
had
that
history
in
my
mind
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
your
position
is
--
let's
see
if
i
get
it
straight
on
the
--
on
this
part
of
it
is
that
obstructions
in
clause
1
of
the
1899
act
is
a
sort
of
the
catchall
phrase
that
includes
something
more
than
is
in
clause
3
of
section
10
that
you
rely
on
and
something
more
than
is
included
in
section
13
which
you
also
rely
on,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
why
i've
been
asking,
what
is
it
that
you
draw
on
from
section
10
of
the
1890
act
that
you
haven't
got
in
the
1899?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
true
that
in
terms,
the
remedies
of
section
6
of
the
1899
act
exclude
or
at
least
do
not
in
terms
apply
to
obstruction
in
section
10.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
--
it
doesn't
say
obstruction.
it
says
that
it
applies
to
certain
sections
and
that
--
and
--
and
one
of
those
sections
is
not
section
10.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
have
to
do
that
to
maintain
your
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
only
--
only
in
one
part
of
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
assuming
it
was
(inaudible)
1890
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
don't
--
don't
interrupt
your
argument.
i
will
get
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you're
talking
now
on
the
question
of
power,
aren't
you?
nobody
disputes
power.
it's
whether
the
congress
is
acting,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
were
doing
that
also
in
the
context
of
other
interest
in
the
future.
to
say
namely
the
rights
of
riparian
people
and
people
who
were
doing
the
kind
of
thing
that
these
parties
are
doing.
there's
a
--
there
are
two
competing
sets
of
factors.
there
are
--
i
wasn't
wholly
directed
on
navigation,
was
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
means
to
be
a
very
conscious
differentiation,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
practical
question.
as
i
understand
this
injunction,
i
was
referring
to
the
(inaudible)
from
putting
back
into
the
river
any
water
that
contained
these
impurities,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
a
standard
right
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
do
you
claim
that
they
can
purify
this
water
beyond
what
they
have
done,
succeeded
in
doing
so
far?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
--
if
they
couldn't,
the
result
would
be
i
suppose
that
they
could
take
the
water
and
then
under
this
injunction,
they
couldn't
put
--
they
wouldn't
be
permitted
to
put
it
back
so
they
--
it
wouldn't
get
back
into
the
river
at
all,
so
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
10
to
be,
not
9.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
following
on
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question,
having
regard
to
the
clauses
2,
3
and
section
13
and
other
portions
of
the
act,
what
is
there
left
for
section
--
the
first
clause
of
section
10
to
operate
on?
in
other
words
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you,
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
read
section
10
out
of
the
picture
and
that
i
think
was
one
of
the
--
the
government
has
to
rely
on
it
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
this
case.
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you
understood
me
correctly.
i
think
i'm
to
blame.
that's
what
i
did
mean.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
leave
it
alone
because
i
think
the
question
is
probably
in
--
in
that
form.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
leave
section
10
in
limbo
for
a
bit
and
go
on
with
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan
is
asking
i
think
if
i
follow
it
is
whether
you
accept
the
government's
argument,
that
structure
in
the
injunction
provision
of
section
12
means
obstruction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
congress
made
any
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
had
the
same
situation,
the
same
issue,
problem
as
a
part
of
the
legislative
history,
do
they?
