10,
that
section
10
of
the
1890
act
is
or
is
not
repealed
by
section
20
of
the
1899
act
in
connection
with
section
10
of
that
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
if
that's
so,
do
we
get
to
this
place
that
section
10
of
the
1890
act
is
still
existing
and
it
prohibits
obstructions,
but
section
10
of
the
1899
act
not
being
inconsistent
then,
would
have
to
deal
only
with
structures.
would
that
impale
on
the
horns
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
horns
of
the
dilemma?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
does
use
the
word
obstruction
in
the
first
--
the
first
line.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
then,
it
treats
with
nothing
but
structures,
the
building
of
any
wharf,
pier,
dolphin,
boom,
weir
or
breakwater,
bulkhead,
etcetera.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
do,
mr.
solicitor,
in
that
connection
with
the
word,
“work”,
in
section
10
of
the
1899
act?
unless
the
work
has
been
recommended
by
the
chief
of
engineers,
could
that
contemplate
merely
the
siltation
from
sewage
of
the
river
bed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand,
mr.
solicitor,
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
although
it
may
be
that
the
substantive
material
in
section
of
the
1890
act
is
repealed
by
section
10
of
1899
act
yet,
the
remedy
provided
by
section
10
of
the
1890
act
still
obtains.
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
left
me
with
a
void
however,
as
to
how
after
you
had
eliminated
all
of
the
substantive
remedial
provisions
of
the
act,
you
could
still
have
the
remedy.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
some
of
the
--
what
percentage
of
it
is
--
is
in
liquid
form?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now
then,
you
say
that's
not
liquid?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
do
you
not
have
that
margin
of
solids
in
so-called
pure
water?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
goes
through
it,
don't
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor
and
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
ask
one
more
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
still
concerned
about
this
--
what
seems
to
me
a
small
amount
of
sedimentation.
are
you
not
here
--
the
government
is
here
in
the
great
lakes
cases
insisting
that
chicago
and
the
state
of
illinois
put
back
into
the
lake
effluent
from
industrial
and
domestic
use
of
90%
pure
water
with
10%
sedimentation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
your
argument
now
as
to
why
you
think
such
intent
of
the
1890
act
was
repealed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
i
do
not
understand
your
reasons
for
saying
that
section
10
aren't
--
the
provisions
of
section
10
are
not
applicable.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
before
you
pass
to
that
term
mr.
jackson,
might
i
ask
you,
is
it
your
view
on
the
matter
of
general
equitable
remedy
here
that
inasmuch
as
a
statutory
remedy
of
some
kind
has
been
provided
for
this
type
of
thing
by
section
13
of
the
1899
act,
that
then
the
general
--
the
reach
of
general
equity
powers
do
not
apply?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
congress
having
entered
that
field
with
the
statute
to
some
extent
destroyed
the
reach
of
general
equity
powers.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
my
i
ask
you
mr.
solicitor,
what
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
evidence
that
they
can
ask
more
preferences,
show
upon
these
waters
and
to
(inaudible)
