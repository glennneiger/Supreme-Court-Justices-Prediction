mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
involves
the
question
of
an
obstruction
to
navigation
in
a
water
that's
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states
maintained
the
action
in
the
trial
court
and
it
was
reversed
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit.
it
involves
two
questions,
one
is
whether
or
not
industrial
waste
can
be
poured
into
the
channel
of
the
calumet
river
without
being
a
violation
of
the
law
of
the
united
states
and
secondly,
whether
the
united
states
isn't
entitled
to
an
injunction
against
such
action.
the
scene
of
this
activity
is
in
the
channel
of
the
calumet
river
about
11
miles
south
to
the
city
of
chicago,
along
the
state
lines
of
indiana
and
illinois.
the
respondents
are
three
large
manufacturing
operations.
one
of
them
engaged
in
iron
manufacture,
amongst
other
things,
interlake
and
the
other
two
engaged
in
both
iron
and
steel
along
with
the
others.
the
other
two
are
republic
and
--
republic
steel
and
international
harvester.
there
is
no
dispute
on
the
facts
in
regard
to
certain
aspects
of
them.
we
do
not,
on
behalf
of
the
government,
think
that
the
factual
issue
is
before
the
court
now.
it
was
reserved
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
not
gone
into.
there
are
contentions
by
the
respondents
that
the
facts
did
not
bear
out
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
the
court
made
elaborate
findings
after
a
long
trial
and
found
against
the
respondents
in
regard
to
the
factual
matters
and
their
principal
contention
where
that
the
shoals
or
interference
reduction
of
the
channel
of
this
river
were
due
to
natural
causes
and
other
manufacturing
institutions
and
not
alone
to
them.
the
court
found
that
81%,
a
little
over
81%,
of
the
amount
of
the
interference
or
obstruction
to
navigation
was
due
to
these
--
the
activities
of
the
--
these
three
respondents.
there
are
27
sewers
or
outfalls
from
which
this
waste
from
these
manufacturing
concerns
including
flue
dust
and
other
things
came
out
into
this
channel.
and
this
quite
--
it's
agreed
between
the
parties
that
about
0
--
0.02%
of
the
amount
of
the
material
was
the
--
the
kind
that
caused
this
interference
or
obstruction
of
the
channel
of
the
calumet
river.
that
is
not
a
very
large
amount
concededly,
but
when
you
take
into
account
the
fact
that
they
used
six
billions
of
gallons
of
water
out
of
the
river
each
month
and
multiply
that
by
12
and
you
have
a
72
billions
of
gallons
of
water
during
a
year.
you
can
see
that
even
with
.02%
being
of
these
settleable
solids
that
it
could
be
a
substantial
amount.
and
then
the
record
shows
that
converting
this
to
what
was
established
as
going
into
the
channel
during
the
years
1952
to
1955,
you
find
that
the
republic
steel
company
put
in
according
to
their
proof,
19,000,
during
these
four
years,
19,000
tons
of
this
material,
or
according
to
the
government's
proof,
27,000
tons
of
the
material
during
four
years
or
better
than
6000
tons
of
this
interference
during
this
--
during
each
year.
it
didn't
work
out
exactly
that
way
because
there
were
some
times
when
the
plants
were
down
and
that
had
to
be
taken
into
account
and
so
forth.
so,
it
was
established
over
the
four-year
period
of
1952
to
1955.
interlake's
figure
was
an
agreed
figure
of
20,000
tons
for
the
four
years
or
approximately
5000
tons
that
they
put
into
this
channel
and
international
harvester
was
in
excess
of
27,000
tons
of
such
material
for
the
same
period.
so
even
that
0.02%,
you
can
see
that
the
amount
was
very
great
that
was
involved.
now,
the
statute
is
section
10
and
13
are
the
ones
in
issue
here
of
the
act
of
the
united
states
in
regard
to
obstructions
to
navigation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
sections
10
and
13
and
they
are
33
u.s.c.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
403
and
407.
now,
the
--
in
the
appendix
at
pages
46
and
thereafter
and
we
set
forth
the
statutes.
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
46
is
the
1890
statute
which
was
--
the
government
contends,
in
part,
repealed
because
the
repeal
was
whatever
was
inconsistent
by
the
1899
act
that's
set
forth
on
page
47
of
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief.
section
10
is
on
page
47,
section
12,
the
enforcement
statute
about
injunction
is
on
the
bottom
of
that
page
and
on
48,
section
13
that
is
--
one
that
is
in
considerable
issue
between
the
parties
is
on
that
lower
half
of
48
and
--
on
over
--
on
49.
then
there
are
several
other
sections
that
i
will
refer
to
and
i
will
go
into
the
particular
provisions
that
are
involved
as
we
go
along
with
the
argument.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
where
they
were
entitled
to
an
injunction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
our
position
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
position
of
the
government,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
upon
the
objections
in
regard
to
the
record,
that
is
the
findings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
it
still
reserved
that
question
in
effect
in
its
opinion.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
still
open
to
them
in
light
of
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
this
act
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
believe
that
you
can
accept
the
findings
as
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
there
was
these
--
there
were
the
deposits
that
were
being
made
and
said
that
they
did
not
come
within
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
the
issue
for
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
it
was
not
repealed
because
congress
said,
“whatever
is
inconsistent
with
the
act
that
was
passed
in
18
--
1899
is
repealed.”
and
this
court
has
dealt
with
both
acts
as
we
construe
it
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
1899
as
being
in
effect.
and
so,
according
to
the
language,
only
the
inconsistent
part
was
repealed
by
the
exact
terms.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
don't
think
that
the
1899
act
is
inconsistent
in
that
regard
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
one
that
you
named
either,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
also
provides
for
obstructions
in
so
many
words
and
for
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
first
thing
that
starts
out
with
and
it
prohibits
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
in
addition.
you'll
notice
there
is
a
semicolon
there.
you
see,
it
makes
an
absolute
prohibition
if
you
turn
47
--
page
47
and
says
that
the
creation
of
any
obstruction
not
affirmatively
authorized
by
congress
to
the
navigable
capacity
of
any
other
waters
of
the
united
states
is
hereby
prohibited.
then
it
goes
on
to
say
and
it
shall,
that's
in
addition,
not
be
lawful
to
do
so
and
so
and
so
and
so
and
so.
now,
the
reason
for
the
passage
of
1890
act
was
that
this
court
had
held
in
the
willamette
iron
bridge
case
that
there
was
no
common
law
that
would
preclude
obstructions
to
navigation.
there
is
no
federal
common
law
and
so,
there
had
--
that
the
united
states
when
it
tried
to
stop
such
obstructions
would
have
to
turn
to
the
state
law
and
very
promptly
after
that,
senator
dole
who
had
--
was
involved
in
the
losing
sight
on
that
case
brought
this
matter
to
the
attention
of
congress
and
proposed
this
legislation
and
got
it
through,
that's
the
1890
act.
then
thereafter,
the
lower
court
--
lower
federal
court
and
there
--
and
later
this
court
when
it
reached
it,
held
that
under
the
1890
act
as
you
will
notice
on
page
46,
had
a
provision
that
unless
it's
affirmatively
authorized
by
law,
in
the
first
sentence
of
section
10
there,
a
lower
federal
court
held
that
affirmatively
authorized
by
law
was
satisfied
by
state
law
and
so
that
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
congress.
that
case
along
with
other
things
by
the
chief
of
the
corps
of
engineers
and
congress
to
take
care
of
that
put
in
the
language
affirmatively
authorized
by
congress.
now,
that
wasn't
all
that
happened
between
1890
and
1899.
and
the
way
that
congress
had
been
dealing
with
this
subject,
they
had
taken
the
rivers
and
harbors
bills
each
time
and
they
had
put
a
provision
about
obstructions
to
navigations
beginning
back
in
1890
and
then
in
a
subsequent
year,
they
would
put
another
provision
about
obstructions
and
navigation.
and
the
congress
said
in
1896
to
the
corps
of
engineers,
“won't
you
please
get
together
our
revisions?
so,
we'll
have
in
one
place,
all
of
the
things
that
are
involved
in
this
question
of
obstructions
to
navigation.”
and
the
corps
of
engineers
did
that
and
congress
suggested
that
they
provide
any
amendments
or
corrections
of
ambiguities
or
emendations.
and
the
corps
of
engineers
brought
forth
the
proposed
act
that
became
the
1899
statute
in
this
one
that's
--
that
we're
relying
on
here
and
it
is
the
principle
at
involving
this
question
and
they
said
they'd
made
certain
revisions
and
additions,
but
no
emendate
--
emendations.
no
--
they
hadn't
taken
anything
out.
they
tried
to
make
this
complete
codification
and
they
presented
that
to
senator
frye,
who
then
brought
that
before
the
congress.
and
this
history
is
very
important
to
this
case,
because
it
shows
the
congressional
intent
and
senator
frye
brought
it
out
before
the
congress
and
he
said,
“this
legislation,
it
has
some
minor
revisions.
no
material
changes
and
you
don't
even
have
to
read
it,”
don't
have
to
or
have
it
read
to
the
congress
at
this
time
before
passing
on,
because
that's
what
i
represented
is.
it's
already
been
before
the
committee
and
that's
what
we're
doing
and
it's
in
the
light
of
that,
that
the
congress
then
passed
the
1899
act
to
--
that's
involved
here
and
not
showing
no
intention
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
reduce
the
effect
of
the
prior
act
of
1890
in
anyway.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
this
court
has
already
said
in
two
cases,
in
the
sanitary
district
case
and
also
in
wisconsin
against
illinois,
that
the
purpose
of
the
1899
act
was
to
enlarge
and
--
and
add
to
--
and
it
was
very
clear
the
intention
and
purpose
of
the
congress
to
cover
this
whole
area
of
forcefully
(inaudible)
of
obstructions
to
navigation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
was
the
format
that
they
tried
to
take
the
remedial
provisions
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
put
them
in
one
place.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
they
still
did
leave
however,
this
absolute
prohibition
to
any
obstruction
to
navigation
in
the
1890
act
--
1899
act.
and
the
--
it's
exactly
the
same
substantially
as
the
1890
except
for
the
provision
as
to
authorization
by
law
in
the
1890
act
and
authorized
by
the
congress
in
the
1899.
so,
you
see
they
were
trying
to
make
that
to
foreclose
any
state
legislative
action
that
would
satisfy
the
1890
act,
but
it
couldn't
any
longer
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
1899.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan
--
justice
harlan,
except
there
is
this
one
factor
that
we
have
to
accept
the
decision
of
this
court
in
sanitary
district
in
wisconsin
against
illinois
in
construing
the
1899
act.
reading
the
language
by
itself,
we
would
say
that
an
obstruction
against
navigation
cannot
--
is
not
permitted
under
this
law,
unless
congress
affirmatively
approved
it,
but
this
court
said
that
in
the
sanitary
district
case
and
in
wisconsin
against
illinois,
that
this
should
be
construed
as
in
the
latter
part
of
the
same
section
10,
delegating
to
the
secretary
of
the
army,
upon
representations
or
recommendations
of
the
corps
of
engineers,
the
power
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
interference
with
navigation
is
reasonable.
that
was
the
term
used
by
the
court.
so
that
he
by
--
by
a
permit
--
and
there's
no
permit
in
this
case
at
all
and
never
asked
for
one
and
never
got
any,
by
permit,
he
could
allow
what
was
not
and
not
unreasonable
or
what
was
reasonable
as
an
interference
with
--
with
navigation
so
that
in
the
light
of
the
way
this
court
then
construed,
in
those
two
cases,
the
1899
statute
section
10,
i
think
you
have
to
read
unto
it
the
gloss
that
there
is
--
if
there
was
any
permit
involved,
a
power
to
find
that
there
is
no
unreasonable
interference,
but
of
course,
since
they
have
left
with
that,
that
isn't
in
the
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
only
thing
we
don't
have
in
the
1899
act
that
we
had
in
the
1890
act
is
the
reference
to
the
right
to
an
injunction
for
an
obstruction
to
navigation
and
when
they
put
it
in
the
later
section
and
--
in
this
codification
and
tried
to
get
these
remedies
together,
they've
made
it
that
we
should
have
the
right
to
an
injunction
to
a
structure.
and
we
say,
well,
it's
clear
congress
said
they
weren't
making
any
material
changes
in
this
old
statute
when
they
passed
1899,
that
structure
in
the
light
of
that
kind
of
a
history
must
be
construed
to
mean
obstruction,
that's
the
only
thing
we
draw
upon
it
in
this
particular
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
doesn't
say
obstruction,
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
this
to
rely
upon
and
that
is
in
the
sanitary
district
and
in
wisconsin
against
illinois,
this
court
knows
enough
about
the
recent
matters
before
them
that
those
involved,
the
withdrawal
of
water
from
the
great
lakes
system,
particularly
at
lake
michigan
and
that
that
did
not
involved
what
we
would
know
as
structures
as
such.
it
involved
and
the
permit
so
said,
the
right
to
withdraw
so
much
water
and
yet
the
court
held
that
that
could
be
enjoined
under
the
1899
act
because
you
see,
those
were
in
1925
and
1929,
those
decisions.
so
the
court
has
already
held
that
those
which
are
certainly
outside
of
any
other
kind
of
structures
that
are
referred
to
in
these
other
sections
and
that
counsel
--
that
respondents
urge,
it
should
be
limited,
were
sufficient
that
the
united
states
could
get
an
injunction.
now,
on
justice
--
mr.
justice
holmes,
in
writing
the
sanitary
district
opinion,
treated
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
an
injunction.
he
didn't
refer
to
any
particular
section
of
the
statute.
but
he
treated
it
as
--
as
the
attorney
general
having
the
power
to
bring
the
action
that
there
was
certainly
inherent
power
in
the
court
to
correct
this
kind
of
an
abuse,
once
you
found
that
it
was
a
--
the
congress
had
--
decided
it
was
unlawful.
and
so
he,
citing
the
san
jacinto
case,
treated
it
as
though
a
power
that
was
obviously
there
and
you
don't
have
to
go
into
any
refinements
about
what's
the
congress
has
said
is
unlawful
that
the
united
states
and
the
attorney
--
to
the
attorney
general
can
get
some
relief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
only
answer
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
a
good
answer
to
that
is
that
it
was
--
that
argument
was
made
in
sanitary
district
and
the
government
made
the
argument
that
it
should
have
the
right
to
an
injunction
under
the
inherent
powers
that's
relevant
to
what
--
the
statute
and
the
court
held
with
it.
so
that
--
but
beyond
that,
i
would
not
ordinarily
urge
this
court
that
structures
mean
obstruction
to
navigation.
it's
different
language
and
ordinarily,
i
wouldn't
be
trying
to
say
the
things
that
they
are
equivalent,
but
i
think,
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
you
have
to
try
it
to
find
out
what
the
intent
of
the
congress
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
one
very
good
reason
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
whittaker,
we
think
it
could.
now,
the
reason
we
think
that
is
--
is
twofold.
we
think
that's
one
of
the
lesser
problems
in
the
case
because
of
this.
when
congress
refers
to
the
kind
of
plans
or
a
program
for
a
particular
type
of
construction,
it
generally
refers
to
works.
and
if
you'll
notice
that
--
that
the
respondents
in
their
brief
had
referred
to
a
number
of
references,
i
think
it's
in
the
footnote
in
which
they
--
it's
repeatedly
treated
as
works
and
not
as
work
as
it
is
done
here.
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
nice
distinction,
but
it's
one
that
congress
deals
with
all
the
time.
and
i
think
in
--
you
just
examine
some
of
the
statutes
about
public
works
and
the
rivers
and
harbors
bills
and
all
of
those
things
and
you'll
see
it's
generally
a
question
of
works.
now,
if
you'll
look
above
in
the
same
statute,
section
10
(2),
you'll
also
see
that
it
says,
except
on
plans
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
recommended
by
the
chief
of
engineers
and
authorized
by
the
secretary
of
the
army.
now,
that's
different
than
the
--
the
matter
of
work
or
works.
and
if
you'll
notice,
the
whole
concept
here
was
to
try
--
was
to
treat
some
of
these
things
differently.
now,
an
obstruction
to
navigation
as
such,
was
being
condemned
by
the
congress.
the
congress
didn't
want
any
kind
of
an
obstruction
to
navigation.
then,
it
was
leaving
and
out
however,
for
certain
things
that
may
not
be
complete
obstruction
to
navigation,
but
might
be
in
part.
and
that's
the
way
this
court
construed
it
in
the
two
cases
i've
referred
to
that
there
could
be
not
and
unreasonable
or
that
there
could
be
a
reasonable
interference
with
navigation
and
there
isn't
any
question
but
what
some
of
these
things
that
are
named
in
the
second
and
third
clauses
here,
do
interfere
with
navigation.
you
just
look
at
them
and
read
them
and
you'll
see
that
there
isn't
any
question,
but
what
they
would
keep
a
vessel
from
going
through
that
particular
kind
of
construction
or
even
a
fill.
but
it
might
be
necessary
to
have
a
fill
at
a
certain
point,
in
order
to
develop
a
proper
channel.
it's
done
on
the
mississippi
river
and
the
missouri
all
the
time
that
they're
built
all
kinds
of
constructions
in
order
to
direct
the
channel
in
a
certain
manner
and
yet,
it
would
interfere
with
anybody
taking
a
vessel
on
the
old
channel
or
other
places
that
have
been
commonly
used
for
navigation.
so,
it
is
an
order
to
provide
for
them
that
the
congress
said,
“there
shall
be
no
obstruction
in
navigation.
and
then
this
court
read
that
it
--
that
power
that
was
granted
to
the
secretary
of
war
was
to
permit
whatever
was
not
an
unreasonable
interference
in
these
limited
cases.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
[attempt
to
laughter]
i'll
get
to
that,
i
think,
shortly.
now,
i
think
we
do
have
an
--
an
important
problem,
maybe
you're
not
ready
to
leave
this
one
yet,
but
an
important
problem
in
regard
to
section
13.
and
it's
relied
on
--
there
it
was
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
very
largely
by
respondents.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
regard,
i
might
--
i
want
to
treat
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
in
regard
to
section
10.
the
court
of
appeals
read
section
10
and
said,
since
these
provisions
for
the
--
for
the
secretary
of
war
to
grant
a
permit
for
certain
--
for
a
fill
and
these
other
modifying
course,
location,
condition
or
capacity
of
any
harbor,
canal
and
so
forth.
and
i
want
to
call
the
attention
to
the
fact
that
sanitary
district
and
wisconsin
against
illinois
were
exactly
there.
they
did
modify
and
change
the
harbor
and
canal
and
so
forth
in
this
very
situation,
because
they
permitted
this
water
to
be
drawn
out
of
the
lake.
no
question
but
what
it
was
reducing,
the
size
and
the
depth
of
lake
michigan.
and
it
was
changing
that,
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
since
there
was
--
you
couldn't
allow
a
fill
like
this,
like
these
in
litigation
here,
because
they
would
obstruct
navigation.
that's
what
exactly
what
they
do,
because
this
is
a
21-channel
--
20-foot
--
one-foot
channel,
200
feet
wide.
and
the
evidence
is
clear
that
it
has
been
reduced
from
21
feet,
by
this
action,
to
17
feet
and
in
some
instance,
12
feet.
now,
that
is
unquestionably
very
destructive
of
the
great
volume
of
navigation
that's
involved
in
this
very
channel,
one
of
the
principal
navigation
channels
of
commerce
in
the
united
states.
the
volume
that
goes
through
here
is
very
great,
not
only
to
these
people,
but
all
along
this
channel
in
this
--
the
sag
channel
and
down
to
the
illinois
river
to
the
chicago
sanitary
canal.
so,
the
courts
said,
“well,
since
they
couldn't
approve
it,
it
couldn't
be
precluded
by
the
first
section.”
and
the
government
says,
“that's
absurd.”
that's
a
wrong
leading
of
it.
if
it's
something
that
couldn't
be
approved,
congress
didn't
want
it
allowed
by
anybody
except
itself,
if
it
was
such
an
obstruction.
if
it
was
so
great
an
obstruction
that
the
--
it's
obvious
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
interference
with
navigation,
then
it
certainly
couldn't
be
approved
by
anybody,
but
congress.
on
the
other
hand,
it
provided
these
other
provisions
so
that
if
it
was
something
that
was
reasonable
and
it
was
desirable
in
order
to
get
its
benefits
as
distinguished
from
some
liabilities
or
detriments
that
would
be
involved,
then
the
secretary
of
war
was
allowed
in
these
particular
situations,
to
permit
it.
and
that
provides
--
that's
the
reason
why
they
added
these
other
clause
in
regard
to
the
fill
and
the
change
in
location.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
recollection
is
they
were.
now,
i'll
see
if
i
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
a
provision
for
bridges,
piers,
docks,
wharfs
and
similar
structures
and
so
forth.
and
this
went
into
more
detail
in
the
1899
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
we
go
at
it
a
little
differently.
we
say
that
insofar
as
the
remedy
was
there,
it
still
remains
because
they
repealed
anything
that's
inconsistent.
we
first
say
that
structures
in
the
1899
act
meant
obstructions
to
navigation
because
they
were
--
they
said
to
the
congress
and
it
was
a
whole
history.
they
weren't
trying
to
change
anything
materially
and
that
would
change
it
materially.
but
we
say,
if
you
don't
find
it
on
that
basis,
then
they
said
we
repeal
only
what
is
inconsistent
and
therefore,
you
still
have
a
--
a
provision
in
regard
to
obstructions
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
still
would
have
the
--
the
provisions
in
the
new
act
of
all
the
--
the
remedies
and
the
declaration
that
it
was
unlawful.
so,
it's
just
like
you
would
use
this
sheers
and
cut
out
part
and
you
say,
this
is
not
inconsistent,
that
stays
in.
this
--
that's
inconsistent
or
superseded
here,
goes
out
because
that's
what
the
congress
said.
but
you
still
have
the
fundamental
declaration
that
an
obstruction
to
navigation
is
unlawful.
and
then
once
you
find
that
it
is
unlawful
and
this
is
the
very
kind
of
thing
that
was
involved,
then
you
apply
the
remedy.
and
if
you
don't
find
that
it
--
it
in
the
remedy,
that
structures
meant
in
light
of
the
legislative
history,
obstruction
to
navigation
for
the
purpose
of
the
injunction,
you
go
back
to
1890
act
and
what
congress
said
when
it
says,
just
to
be
safe
in
this
matter,
they
--
i'm
--
that's
my
language,
but
i
think
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do,
just
to
be
safe,
we
only
repeal.
and
you
know,
congress
doesn't
do
that
generally,
they
--
they
repeal
an
act
in
terms
or
so
much
of
the
act
and
so
forth,
but
just
to
be
safe,
they
did
say
we
repeal
whatever
is
inconsistent
which
means,
they
left
in
effect,
everything
that
wasn't
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
that's
generally
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
read
the
construction
of
the
provision
of
section
--
i
think
it's
16
to
limit
--
let
me
see
--
no,
it's
section
12
on
the
top
of
page
48
where
it
says,
“the
removal
of
any
structures
--
mr.
justice
black
is
down
and
further
on
page
48
of
our
brief
there.
the
relief
provision
about
injunctions
and
further,
the
removal
of
any
structures
or
parts
of
structures
directed
in
violations
of
provisions
on
the
said
section's
maybe
--
maybe
enforced
by
injunction
and
so
forth.
now,
that
uses
the
word
structures
instead
of
obstruction
to
navigation
as
was
before.
and
we
say
that
if
that
is
inconsistent,
if
you
won't,
you
don't
find
it
that
you
can
read
it
as
the
same
because
congress
was
trying
to
do
the
same
thing
and
not
making
material
change,
then
we
say,
you
go
back
to
the
other
act
and
add
to
this
whatever
is
there
because
it's
not
inconsistent.
now,
i
--
i
do
want
to
deal
with
section
13,
which
prohibits
the
discharge
for
any
manufacturing
establishment
and
so
forth
of
refuse
matter
of
any
kind.
that's
on
the
lower
half
of
page
48
of
the
government's
brief
and
then,
the
point
that's
particularly
in
issue
is
other
than
that
flowing
from
streets
and
sewers
passing
therefrom
in
a
liquid
state
into
any
navigable
water
of
the
united
states
and
so
forth.
and
they
claim,
the
claim
by
respondents
is
that
it's
intended
that
their
type
of
material
coming
out
in
this
sewer
is
within
that
exception
and
therefore,
they
are
not
subject
to
section
10,
they
are
subject
to
section
13,
but
they
are
within
the
exception
and
this
obstruction
therefore,
is
not
in
violation
of
law.
now,
we
--
it's
the
position
of
the
government
in
the
first
place
with
what
comes
out
doesn't
satisfy
the
exception
because
it
isn't
in
a
liquid
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
99
and
98
hundredths.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
what
--
in
people
dealing
with
this
subject
that
is
not
liquid
in
a
liquid
state,
because
it's
not
complete.
there
are
--
these
particles
are
what
are
known
by
people
dealing
in
the
question
of
pollution
and
obstructions
in
navigation
are
known
as
settleable.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
settleable
particles
and
the
--
then,
there
are
suspended
particles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
was
--
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
answer
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
didn't
think
of
it
that
large
in
the
ordinary
processing
of
drinking
water,
but
i
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
answer
that
without
examining
directly.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
generally,
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
doesn't.
now,
that's
--
that's
the
difference
between
settleable
particles
or
solids
and
suspended
as
understood
in
terms
of
pollution,
because
there
are
many
kinds
of
particles
that
are
solids.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
that
are
suspended
in
water
or
in
liquids,
but
those
solids
when
they're
exposed
to
oxygen
and
the
other
elements
in
the
water
of
the
stream,
will
disappear
and
be
dissipated
and
never
form
an
obstruction
of
any
kind.
now,
that
involves
a
question
of
the
speed
of
the
stream
in
this
channel,
is
when
it
moves
very
slowly.
in
fact,
it
reverses
itself
at
times.
so
the
problem
is
much
greater,
but
there
isn't
any
question
about
what
this
is
known
and
treated
by
people
who
deal
with
this
subject
as
settleable
solids
or
those
within
a
period
of
two
hours
will
settle
out
and
then
become
an
obstruction
to
navigation.
now
a
good
example
of
how
people
distinguish
that
were
working
in
this
whole
field
is
the
ohio
compact
and
if
you'll
recall
in
the
briefs,
they
refer
to
the
fact
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
united
states
permitted
these
compacts
to
be
made
in
the
higher
compact
and
if
congress
thought
this
law
--
many
thing
like
this,
why
would
they
allow
a
compact
like
that?
well,
the
compact
provides
in
so
many
term
--
words
expressly
that
all
the
settleable
solids
are
to
be
removed.
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
now,
they
didn't
distinguish
in
using
that
argument
between
suspended
solids
that
don't
become
settleable
and
those
that
are
settleable,
but
the
compacting
states
didn't
purport
for
a
moment
in
that
compact
to
allow
them
to
take
settleable
solids
and
be
able
to
only
eliminate
45%
as
they
did
with
regard
to
the
rest
of
it.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
other
type
of
solids
will
generally,
unless
their
conditions
are
unusual,
take
care
of
themselves
by
becoming
dissolved
and
completely
liquid.
so,
they
become
no
obstruction
to
navigation,
but
overall
in
this
whole
picture,
congress
was
trying
to
see
that
we
be
able
to
--
to
have
navigation.
we
have
commerce
and
they
were
not
--
you
can't
find
anything
in
this
law
or
the
legislative
history
that
shows
a
disposition
to
allow
people
to
build
something
up
like
this
and
destroy
what
the
country
is
spending
millions
of
dollars
every
year
to
provide
not
just
for
these
people,
but
for
the
whole
community.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i'm
talking
beyond
power.
i'm
talking
to
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
they
were
trying
to
get
rid,
avoid
and
protect
against
this
very
kind
of
thing.
they
were
trying
to
preserve
and
protect
navigation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
they
were
also,
you
recall
in
section
13,
they
do
have
an
out
in
that
they
also
provide
for
the
secretary
of
war
to
grant
permits
but
--
i
would
like
to
deal
--
now,
it's
claimed
that
back
in
1890,
in
1899,
no
one
concedes
at
all
that
you
couldn't
pour
out
of
the
sewers,
any
kinds
of
material
like
this.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
was
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
no
--
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
unlikeness.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
there
is
a
--
a
case
that
came
up,
the
wilson
case
in
the
second
circuit
in
regard
to
that
part
of
the
problem
that's
involved
here
and
that
was
the
sunken
barge
and
there,
the
government
tried
to
get
an
injunction
and
the
court
held
that
they
couldn't
get
injunction
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
because
it
said,
there
is
a
provision
here
that
if
a
party
who
has
a
sunken
barge,
does
not
remove
it,
you
can
do
it
yourself
and
you
can
charge
the
vessel
and
--
or
give
it
to
the
person
that
removes
it
and
that's
an
adequate
remedy.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that
because
we
think
congress
did
give
us
another
adequate
remedy
and
took
care
of
the
problem.
and
we
do
say
is
that
there
are
some
statements
in
that
opinion
that
we
don't
agree
with.
it
took
issue
to
the
ninth
circuit
holding
in
regard
to
the
1890
and
1899
acts
being
both
in
effect.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it
denied
the
power.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
said
that
congress
had
provided
the
other
remedy
which
was
adequate
and
--
and
had
so
decided
by
this
particular
provision
where
it
didn't
provide
coverage
for
the
other,
but
in
--
even
in
that
case,
it
didn't
say
that
there
wasn't
a
violation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
said
there
was
a
--
an
obstruction
in
navigation,
but
said
you
had
to
look
to
this
particular
provision
for
relief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
argument,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
we
don't
think
that's
correct
because
we
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
and
we
say
that
if
you're
going
to
read
it
out,
you
have
to
find
an
express
purpose
of
the
congress
to
deprive
the
courts
of
an
inherent
power
to
protect
in
regard
of
this
situation
that
it
would
have
except
for
such
a
prohibition.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it's
one
we
all
have
to
accept
because
this
court
said
it
twice.
and
so,
they're
--
in
the
sanitary
district
case
and
wisconsin
against
illinois,
this
court
said,
the
purpose
was
to
enlarge
and
to
take
care
of
all
these
problems
in
various
certain
terms.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
a
remedy
to
find
and
in
present
provisions
in
some
--
both
of
those
are
provided
in
the
act,
but
the
government
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
section
16.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
page
49.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
in
section
12
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
are
some
fines
provided.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
section
12
on
page
47
in
the
top
of
four
--
page
48.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
characterize
their
argument
as
merely
limiting
the
fine
part
to
structures.
i
think
they
concede
that
the
fine
and
imprisonment
provisions
would
apply
to
obstruction
as
well.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
we
say
that
that
is
--
does
not
--
not
an
adequate
remedy
that
we've
--
for
navigation,
we've
got
to
get
rid
of
this
obstruction
and
not
have
to
deal
with
it
periodically
or
repeatedly.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
add
that
on,
but
in
order
to
deal
with
the
inherent
power
and
the
--
and
the
equitable
right,
i
say
that
there's
other
provisions.
now,
i'd
like
to
deal
just
briefly
with
this
question
of
their
claim
that
back
in
1890
in
--
in
that
--
and
1899
when
these
laws
were
passed,
everybody
knew
that
this
kind
of
material
was
going
out
in
the
sewers
and
therefore,
it's
absurd
to
claim
that
this
exception
wasn't
provided
to
take
care
of
this
very
thing.
i
think
they
are
seriously
affected
on
that
argument
if
you
examine
it,
by
the
fact
that
congress
was
careful
to
provide
that
the
secretary
of
war
could
allow
permits
even
as
to
section
13.
so
that
if
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
had
to
be
done
in
the
interest
of
carrying
on
the
competing
interest,
there
is
a
provision
for
it,
assuming
that
it
isn't
an
absolute
obstruction
to
navigation.
it's
something
that
could
be
construed
as
being
reasonable
and
i
assume
that
that
competing
interest
would
have
to
be
reasonable
in
order
to
be
justified
in
its
competition.
but
going
beyond
that,
it's
claimed
that
there
--
here
is
an
attorney
general's
opinion
which
they
cite
on
page
32
of
international
harvester
company
brief,
32
of
the
international
harvester
company
brief
and
they
say
it's
an
1894
opinion
and
they
use
it
to
say
that
the
attorney
general
refused
to
give
an
opinion.
and
therefore,
they
say
that
since
he
didn't
refer
to
the
other
sections
when
they
asked
him
about
section
6
and
its
effect,
which
was
now
section
13
substantially,
that
he
must've
recognized
that
the
only
possible
place
for
--
that
there
could
be
any
application
to
section
13.
now,
there
are
several
things
wrong
with
that
argument,
i
want
to
deal
with
very
briefly.
first,
the
opinion
was
given
1897
and
not
1894
as
they
state.
secondly,
the
law
that
they
referred
to
was
the
1894
law
and
it
didn't
have
in
it
the
section
10
and
the
provisions
that
we
refer
to.
that
was
in
a
different
statute.
and
third,
the
attorney
general
was
only
asked
about
this
particular
one,
but
the
thing
that
cuts
against
them
very
greatly,
is
the
further
language
as
you
get
down
to
the
bottom
of
that
opinion
in
which
he
is
dealing
with
the
fact
that
he's
asked
as
to
application
of
this
particular
statute,
section
6,
that's
now,
substantially
section
13
and
then
he
says
what
the
statute
provides
and
that's
in
quotes.
and
then
he
says,
“whether
or
not,
the
bar
complained
of
is
formed
by
discharge
from
the
sewer
which
so
far
as
appears,
is
left
to
inference
and
whether
the
sand
or
other
materials
discharged
merely
in
suspension
and
is
then
deposited
upon
the
bar
by
the
ordinary
prompt
action
of
gravity
or
passes
out
in
solution
and
is
then
precipitated,
are
facts
that
he
must
have
before
he
can
answer
the
question.
now,
i
think
that
shows
how
unreasonable
or
--
or
unsupported
their
claim
is
that
people
at
that
time
didn't
think
of
the
very
thing
that
we're
claiming
in
this
case
as
the
difference
between
settleable
and
suspended
particles
when
he
says
exactly
the
description
we
have,
i've
got
to
know,
are
these
the
kind
of
particles
that
are
going
to
fall
down
or
are
they
going
to
continue
in
suspension.
and
if
you
tell
me
that,
then
i
can
answer
this
question
which
shows
that
in
order
to
try
to
answer
what
was
in
a
liquid
state,
he
was
looking
for
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
we
tell
this
court
now.
these
are
settleable
particles
that
did
do
fall
down
and
will
fall
down
and
do
form
an
obstruction.
and
if
there
was
any
idea
at
that
time
that
people
were
doing
this
to
such
an
extent,
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
make
such
a
claim
today,
then
why
would
the
attorney
general
pose
a
very
question
that
we
say
is
controlling?
now,
there's
no
question
of
what
these
very
particles
are
obstructions,
they
are
settleable
and
they
have
formed
this
obstruction
and
caused
this
great
reduction
in
this
channel.
now,
they
form
it
in
--
in
this
way.
they
really
form
a
structure
and
i'm
not
urging
that
as
satisfying
the
provisions
of
--
of
the
section
in
regard
to
structures
and
injunction
at
all,
but
actually,
as
described
by
the
engineers
and
technicians,
these
particles,
iron
particles
and
others
that
come
out
of
this
waste
have
an
electric
charge
and
they
form
what
is
called
flocculation
so
that
they
interlace.
and
they
then
form
a
regular
small
building
in
this
channel
and
you
can
pour
sand,
you
can
pour
other
kinds
of
sludge
and
other
waste
in
it
and
it
will
be
the
same
capacity,
the
same
size
after
you
get
through
as
is
it
was
immediately
before,
because
it
will
fit
within
the
structure.
so
that
--
that
they
in
effect,
is
the
flocculation
really
of
these
particular
particles
as
they
settle
out
that
builds
them
into
structure
that
makes
it
impossible
to
navigate
in
the
area
where
they
are.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
and
it
also
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
requires
them
to
dredge.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
unless
they
get
a
permit.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
could
be
done.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
economic.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
the
--
in
the
past,
they've
dredged.
some
of
them
was
dredged
in
--
for
50
years,
this
construction
has
been
made
by
the
corps
of
engineers
on
this
very
statute
as
what
it
means.
and
for
many
years,
the
illinois
steel
company
that
isn't
the
respondent
or
defendant
in
this
case,
proceeded
to
dredge,
every
couple
of
years
and
clean
this
out.
now,
there
was
--
a
demand
was
made
from
41
to
49
on
these
people
and
they
didn't
do
it.
in
1951,
they
did
dredge
and
then
they
refused
to
and
the
--
and
the
congress
committee
said,
it's
absurd
that
they
should
be
getting
all
the
benefits
of
this
channel,
the
navigation
and
all
of
the
money
that
united
states
was
pouring
into
it
and
not
be
willing
to
dredge
out
the
interference
that
they
themselves
were
creating.
so,
the
court
left
it
that
they
--
if
they've
got
a
permit
and
would
make
arrangements
to
dredge
and
take
care
of
his
burden,
they
were
imposing
on
navigation
that
they
would
--
it
would
be
sufficient
and
i
assume
that
would
be
the
attitude
of
the
corps
of
engineers
and
--
and
the
government.
all
the
government
wants
is
to
have
the
benefit
of
this
navigation
channel
for
all
the
people,
not
just
for
these.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
didn't
think
it
was.
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
might
ask
the
other
counsel
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
from
the
government's
standpoint,
we
certainly
were
not
putting
an
issue.
we
didn't
think
it
was.
we
could
be
mistaken
by
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
government
never
took
that
position
in
those
cases.
the
government
is
--
thought
that
the
question
should
be
reexamined
and
the
question
of
how
much
water
could
be
withdrawn
form
lake
michigan
for
the
purposes
of
the
chicago
sanitary
canal
and
the
illinois
river
navigation,
what
it
needed
and
how
much
purification
there
could
be,
but
we
have
never
taken
the
position
that
there
should
be
--
the
effluent
should
be
returned
from
the
river.
now,
that
is
the
position
of
the
other
states,
but
not
of
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
the
sanitary
district
case,
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
the
language
of
the
court
on
pages
428
and
429.
justice
home
was
--
holmes
was
explicit.
in
the
first
part,
he
quoted
in
regard
to
section
10
not
only
the
subsequent
clauses
referred
to
by
counsel
with
just
argument.
but
he
started
out
by
the
first
--
first
clause
involving
the
creation
of
any
obstruction,
not
affirmatively
authorized
by
congress
is
hereby
prohibited.
he
includes
that
as
the
language
that
he
is
considering
in
section
10
as
well
as
the
later
part.
then
he
says
by
section
12,
violation
of
the
law
is
made
a
misdemeanor
and
punished
and
the
removal
of
prohibited
structures
maybe
enforced
by
injunction
of
the
proper
court
of
the
united
states
in
a
suit
under
the
direction
of
the
attorney
general.
so
he's
talking
about
the
same
section
10
and
the
same
provision
about
structures.
this
statute
repeatedly
has
been
held
to
be
constitutional,
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
there's
a
broad
expression
of
policy
in
unmistakable
terms
advancing
upon
an
earlier
act
of
1890.
and
then
he
says
it
forbad
obstruction
to
navigable
capacity.
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
as
now
applied,
it
concerns
a
change
in
the
condition
of
the
lakes
and
the
chicago
river
admitted
to
be
navigable
--
navigable,
and
if
that
be
necessary
an
obstruction
to
their
navigable
capacity.
then
the
court
proceeded
in
accordance
with
that
under
section
10
and
section
12
to
grant
the
injunction
as
grave.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
the
essence
to
the
case
was
(voice
overlap)
the
withdrawal
of
water.
the
permit
was
the
extent
of
the
water
and
the
court
didn't
enjoin
the
works
in
any
way.
it
enjoined
the
withdrawal
beyond
what
the
secretary
had
permitted.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
they
could
continue
to
have
the
works?
or
they
could
do
them
by
any
other
means?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
if
the
issue
was
the
question
of
the
permit
which
they
had
exceeded
and
then
obstructed
this
--
the
navigable
capacity.
now,
in
the
wisconsin
against
the
illinois,
in
the
opinion
by
chief
justice
taft,
the
court
deals
with
the
sanitary
opinion
and
says,
“the
true
intent
of
the
act
of
congress
was
that
unreasonable
obstructions
to
navigation
and
navigable
capacity
were
to
be
prohibited.”
and
in
the
cases
described
in
the
second
and
third
clause
of
section
10,
the
secretary
of
war
acting
on
the
recommendations
of
the
chief
of
engineers
was
authorized
to
determine
what
in
the
particular
cases
constituted
an
unreasonable
obstruction.
so
it
first
says
that
obstructions
that
were
unreasonable
were
absolutely
prohibited
unless
they
got
congress'
consent.
and
then
if
they
were
not
unreasonable,
they
could
get
the
permit
that
would
authorize
it.
now,
that
is
the
proper
construction
of
those
cases
and
the
government's
willing
to
rely
on
those
two
cases
of
this
court
as
to
how
they
have
applied
and
interpreted
this
act
--
these
sections
of
the
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
could
do
a
great
deal.
now,
they
say
it's
not
economic
to
take
anymore
of
this
material
out
of
the
water.
and
i
think
probably
isn't
economic
because
there
isn't
any
question
what
they
could
precipitate
or
settle
more
by
additional
settling
basins
but
it's
a
question
of
what
the
cost
would
be
of
doing
that?
now,
then
you
have
to
weigh
it
against
the
question
of
dredging
and
it's
cheaper
to
dredge
than
to
build
additional
settling
basins
to
take
it
out.
in
the
first
place
as
we
set
out
in
the
appendix
here
in
1899,
the
secretary
--
of
the
corps
of
engineers
went
to
the
illinois
steel
company
involved
in
the
same
problem,
although
illinois
steel
has
dredged
over
a
great
many
years
as
the
government
asked.
but
back
in
1899,
the
question
was
brought
up
and
the
corps
of
engineers
asked
that
they
put
in
settling
basins
because
they
were
throwing
even
more
material
into
this
channel
and
obstructing
it.
now,
of
course
it's
--
it's
a
lot
cheaper
if
you
don't
have
to
dredge
either
like
they're
saying
here
today.
the
government
has
asked
them
to
get
a
permit
and
dredge
or
not
do
it
anymore.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
what
it
can
--
because
portable
water
is
recognized
by
the
people
in
municipal
water
field
as
having
30
to
50
particles
of
several
solids
in
it
per
million
parts.
now,
this
is
at
least
four
times
or
more
than
now.
so
in
order
to
get
portable
water,
all
your
municipal
systems
have
to
do
better
than
this.
it's
just
a
question
of
the
economics
of
whether
they
want
to
do
it.
and
if
they
can
get
out
dredging
and
get
out
of
doing
it,
they
unload
the
whole
cost
on
the
citizens
in
taxes.
and
it's
the
position
of
the
government
just
as
--
as
the
committee
said
that
it's
unreasonable.
they
get
the
full
benefit
of
this
navigation
and
the
tremendous
sum
of
the
united
states
pays
to
provide
navigable
channels
and
waters
for
this
country.
and
it's
a
wonderful
benefit
to
them
but
they
don't.
they
want
to
unload
these
--
this
residue
there
and
make
the
people
pay
for
that
too.
and
the
--
the
congress
thought
it
was
unreasonable
and
the
government
thinks
is
unreasonable.
and
that
we'd
like
to
have
as
much
help
as
possible
from
the
court
to
help
clean
up
these
waters
that
are
one
of
the
great
assets
of
this
nation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'll
just
answer
it,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
that
i
know,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
there
is
one
amendment
in
regard
to
oil
and
then
there's
some
legislative
history
that
this
act
didn't
cover.
this
was
to
deal
to
with
obstructions
to
navigation
and
oil
is
not
an
obstruction,
it
is
a
matter
of
pollution.
and
so
there's
quite
a
bit
of
--
of
--
in
legislative
history
at
that
time
about
the
meaning
of
this
act
and
what
it's
trying
to
reach.
and
that
this
section
13
was
not
trying
to
reach
pollution
but
was
trying
to
reach
obstructions.
and
it
goes
into
that
at
some
length.
and
therefore,
they
wanted
a
provision,
felt
that
it
wasn't
covered
oil.
that
you
might
pour
--
many
people
were
pouring
out
of
vessels
and
out
of
manufacturing
concerns.
it
didn't
form
an
obstruction
to
navigation
but
it
pollute
the
water
and
therefore
it
had
to
be
handled
separately.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
--
i
think
it's
worse
here
because
this
channel
moves
so
slowly.
you
see
it
was
built
so
that
it
--
with
it
sag
channel,
it
would
run
away
from
the
lake
when
originally
it
ran
to
the
lake.
and
therefore,
even
sometimes
when
there
is
a
lot
of
flood
water.
it
still
runs
into
the
lake
despite
the
engineering
that
they
have
made
of
it.
but
in
normal
times
it
moves
very
slowly
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
of
settlable
solids
because
by
definition,
that's
whatever
it
will
settle
within
a
period
of
two
minutes.
but
in
a
fast
moving
stream,
for
instance,
like
the
hudson
or
something
like
that,
it
would
wash
on
down
and
get
out
of
the
way.
although
even
there,
there
is
--
there
had
been
some
problems
that
are
--
are
--
the
congress
has
had
to
deal
with
because
the
vessels
that
the
city
of
new
york
would
use
in
other
people
dealing
with
sanitation
problems,
they
take
them
in
all
scows
that
couldn't
hold
the
material
and
it
would
all
drop
out
in
the
harbor
before
they
got
out
to
a
great
enough
depth.
and
the
congress
has
acted
in
separate
section
in
regard
to
that.
so
it
is
a
very
serious
problem
but
it
comes
up
differently
in
this
particular
channel
because
of
the
slow
moving.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
didn't
mean
to
represent.
it
was
in
the
record.
i
was
just
dealing
with
the
physical
of
the
situation.
