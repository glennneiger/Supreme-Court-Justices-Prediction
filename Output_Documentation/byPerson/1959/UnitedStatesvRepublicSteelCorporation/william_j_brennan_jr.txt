justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that
word
that
you've
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
has
the
phrase
(inaudible)
do
i
understand
your
given
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
if
this
condition
is
an
obstruction
within
section
10,
and
the
government's
right
to
equitable
problems?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
wonder
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
hence,
if
it
is,
you
say
that
--
the
reason
i
ask
as
i
thought
i
misunderstood
you
exactly
to
say
“yes,
it
does.”
or
even
the
distribution
were
structure
within
section
10.
therefore,
unless
it's
not
what
--
what
the
word
“structure”
means.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
therefore,
this
equitable
relief
would
not
be
available.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that
but
that's
not
my
question.
i'll
try
to
say
it
slow.
it
sets
down
the
premise
that
section
10
does
apply
and
this
is
--
this
condition
isn't
obstruction
within
that
section.
what
relief
is
the
government
is
entitled
to
if
that's
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that.
