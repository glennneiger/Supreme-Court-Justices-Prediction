i
had
in
this
argument
(inaudible)
hard
to
resist
and
their
most
appealing
but
is
it
the
basis
for
rewriting
the
rule?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
a
different
question.
it
may
be
that
they
were
right
about
it.
i
didn't
mean
to
foreclose
that
issue,
but
i
was
merely
calling
your
attention
to
the
fact,
many
times
i've
had
made
to
me,
this
argument
that
you're
making
and
it's
a
difficult
one
to
resist
and
simply
because
a
notice
is
one
day
late
that
very
important
rights
are
to
be
lost,
but
yet
are
not
courts
bound
by
a
--
an
ironclad
rule
if
it
is
such?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
was
the
error
of
this
not
harmless
doesn't
touch
the
question
of
whether
the
filling
of
the
notice
within
the
prescribed
10
days
as
mandatory
and
jurisdictionally?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
