mr.
i.
william
stempil
honorable
chief
justice
and
learned
justices,
by
this
time
the
court
knows
and
understands
the
circumstances
under
which
the
filling
of
the
notices
of
appeal
in
this
case
were
made.
evidently,
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
there
was
merit
in
the
causes,
as
they
were
presented
to
them
otherwise
what
other
reason
would
they
want
to
have
jurisdiction
over
the
cases
and
to
hear
them.
having
already
decided
on
the
45
(b)
(2)
that
the
district
court
exercised
its
juri
--
jurisdictional
and
discretionary
powers
to
act
as
it
did,
when
it
enlarge
directed
to
indicated
that
the
forma
pauperis
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
late
and
it
was
done
under
circumstances
constituting
legal,
excusable
neglect
under
45
(b)
and
the
order
did
state
that.
true
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
may
a
district
court
allow
the
filling
of
that
notice
under
those
circumstances
if
the
reason
for
the
untimely
filling
is
excusable
neglect?
but
the
trouble
here
is
that
the
government
wants
to
go
further
than
just
attacking
that
action.
it
wants
to
make
this
a
cardinal
offense
against
the
rules
and
insist
that
an
action
of
this
type
will
open
the
flood
gates
and
it
will
amount
to
frivolous
appeal
taking
by
everybody
who
might
come
trump
up
some
excuse
and
then
come
along
and
say,
"i'm
filling
the
appeal
or
the
notice
of
appeal
late
on
the
grounds
of
excusable
neglect."
the
government
contends
that
if
this
type
of
ruling
and
decision
and
opinion
is
allowed
to
stand,
it
would
permit
unwarranted
delay
and
could
result
in
appeal
as
mrs.
--
as
miss
rosenberg
said
being
filed
months
and
even
years
after
the
time
for
appeal
has
expired.
in
the
brief
that
the
government
has
filed,
it
asks
the
court
to
take
special
notice
of
criminal
rule
(2)
as
it
pertains
to
the
rules
that
we
are
now
discussing,
37
and
45.
and
quick
to
point
out
that
it
provides
the
standard
for
constructing
and
construing
the
criminal
rules
and
advises
as
that
these
standards
include
three
things,
simplicity
in
administration,
fairness
in
the
administration
and
elimination
of
delay.
and
that
to
allow
on
appeal
at
anytime
on
the
showing
of
what
they
say
excusable
neglect
is
not
within
the
standards
for
interpreting
the
rules.
i
say,
that's
not
logical
reasoning
and
i
can't
go
along
with
the
government.
it's
important
to
note
that
when
the
rule
writers,
who
were
appointed
by
this
court
had
to
determine
whether
the
rules
should
have
the
words,
may
or
shall
or
must,
where
they
wanted
the
rules
to
be
mandatory,
they
used
the
word
"shall"
or
the
word
"must,"
but
where
a
situation
arose
where
the
court
or
the
trier
of
the
facts
had
to
determine
for
itself
and
use
its
own
discretion
as
to
what
had
to
be
done
in
the
interest
of
justice,
then,
the
word
"may"
was
used.
i
asked
the
question,
what
is
wrong
with
someone
seeking
review
of
an
apparent
miscarriage
of
justice
and
being
allowed
to
do
so
by
a
forward
and
correct
thinking
opinion
of
a
court
instead
being
thwarted
by
a
rule
or
the
interpretation
of
a
rule
that
says,
"no,
you
cannot
prove
yourself
innocent."
now,
although
we
know
you
are
and
the
government
knows,
having
read
the
brief,
and
the
court
of
appeals
having
the
brief
before
it,
you
should
have
told
us
about
it
monday.
today
is
tuesday,
it's
too
late.
the
rule
says
so
and
we
can't
do
anything
about
it.
sorry,
we've
got
to
go
by
the
rules.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
yes
your
honor,
under
the
certain
circumstances.
i
say,
there
is
nothing
wrong
when
the
court
rules
correctly.
as
the
party
filing
of
an
appeal,
when
the
ends
of
justice
is
served
and
an
innocent
person
is
freed
after
being
incorrectly
convicted
of
a
crime
that
he
is
blameless
of,
we
don't
have
to
rewrite
the
rules.
the
rules
give
us
the
power,
gives
the
district
court
the
power
now
under
45
(b)
as
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
it
--
the
rules
and
said
they
do
have
the
power.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
i
say,
it
might
be
an
ironclad
rule,
but
if
your
honor
will
allow
me
to
bring
out
a
point,
i
think,
we're
dealing
with
human
beings
and
the
rules
took
care
of
that,
i'll
bring
it
out.
i
say
by
--
when
the
court
rules
correctly
in
allowing
someone
or
allowing
the
court
to
rule
as
it
did
in
this
case,
to
make
sure
that
an
injustice
is
not
done,
that's
good
law.
isn't
that
what
justices
are
ought
to
be?
i'm
under
the
impression
that
the
rules
were
promulgated
by
human
beings
to
see
that
justice
was
done.
yet,
the
government
contends
that
these
rules
must
be
used
and
interpreted
as
gates
never
to
be
open
to
those
who
are
entitled
through
morality,
through
ethics,
through
common
sense
and
logic
to
justice
despite
the
interpretation
given
to
rules
in
these
cases
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
in
construing
the
standards
of
the
rules
to
ensure
the
simplicity
and
procedure,
the
fairness
in
the
administration
and
the
elimination
of
delay,
if
that
means
taking
away
a
judge's
discretion
as
to
what
he
can
do
and
what
he
cannot
do
legally,
under
the
rules
and
as
interpreted
by
the
court
of
appeal
in
this
case,
i
say,
there
would
be
no
simplicity
in
procedure.
there
will
be
a
manifest
injustice
and
unfairness
in
the
administration
of
justice
leaving
only
a
speedy
way
to
get
rid
of
and
dispose
all
--
of
all
the
criminal
cases.
and
even
at
the
chance
of
overlooking
perhaps
one
that
might
merit
an
appeal
in
order
to
avoid
a
harsh
injustice.
i
know
of
no
other
instance
than
in
a
present
case,
where
a
district
court
has
allowed
a
so
called
filling
late
due
to
excusable
neglect
on
the
45
(b)
(2)
with
the
court
of
appeals
agreeing
to
hear
the
case
on
the
merits,
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
careful
first
to
point
out
that
it
was
the
district
court,
the
district
court
that
had
to
determine
first
if
the
circumstances
warranted
the
exercise
of
the
power
conferred
under
the
45
(b)
(2),
to
the
district
court
before
accepting
jurisdiction.
on
november
25th,
two
weeks
ago,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
having
previously
accepted
jurisdiction
of
a
tardily
filed
appeal
under
45
(b)
(2)
disposed
of
it
thusly.
"this
court's
troyit
robinson
ruling
is
the
law
of
this
jurisdiction.
it
holds
that
we
have
jurisdiction
of
a
tardy
criminal
appeal
if
excusable
neglect
is
found.
such
neglect
having
been
determined
to
exist,
we
must
entertain
the
present
appeal.
but,
since
our
consideration
of
the
merits,
convinces
us
that
there
is
no
prejudicial
error,
the
resulting
affirmance
will
have
the
same
effect
as
the
dismissal
or
want
of
prosecution."
mr.
i.
william
stempil
i
have
found
if
your
honor
will
allow
me
as
i
go
along
to
bring
it
out
in
order,
supporting
my
position,
yes.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
judge
medina
--
mr.
i.
william
stempil
yes.
i'm
glad
you
mentioned
that
case.
reading
judge
medina's
decision
as
i
will
bring
out
later,
evidently
judge
medina
never
went
beyond
rule
37
because
he
specifically
says,
"there
is
nothing
in
rule
37
that
makes
mention
of
excusable
neglect."
mr.
i.
william
stempil
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
have.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
yes.
in
resnick
versus
lehigh
valley
railroad
11
federal
rules
decision
76,
the
court
is
aware
under
the
provisions
of
rule
(6)
(b),
it
is
with
out
power
to
extend
the
time
for
taking
any
action
under
73
(a).
thus,
the
court
cannot
enlarge
the
prescribed
period.
however,
in
consideration
of
express
representations
made
by
defendant's
counsel,
the
court
finds
that
upon
all
of
the
facts
that
there
is
a
showing
of
excusable
neglect
and
all
findings
are
dated
back
to
the
last
day
allowed
under
the
rules.
under
that
condition,
the
court
instead
of
using
45
(b),
just
used
its
discretion
and
its
power
and
dated
everything
back.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
i'll
have
another
one
for
you.
in
ledwith
versus
starkin,
2
federal
rules
decision
539,
ordinarily,
the
discretion
should
be
exercised
towards
granting
relief
if
there's
an
adequate
showing
of
excusable
neglect
to
take
proper
action
within
the
time
required.
even
when
a
party
makes
a
showing
of
mistake,
inadvertence,
surprise
for
excusable
neglect
is
right
to
have
a
default
judgment
set
aside
is
not
absolute.
and
whether
the
default
should
be
set
aside
rest
in
the
sound
discretion
of
the
court
although
upon
adequate
showing,
the
court's
discretion
should
ordinarily
inclined
towards
granting
rather
that
denying
relief,
especially
if
no
intervening
rights
have
attached
in
reliance
upon
the
judgment
and
no
actual
injustice
will
ensue.
now,
your
honor
asked
me
that
perhaps
they
would
going
about
in
another
fashion,
going
getting
around,
we
might
perhaps
use
the
harmless
error
statute.
there,
it
says
if
it
was
an
error
for
the
district
court
judge
to
hold
the
motion
timely
rather
than
grant
an
enlargement
of
time
for
making
it,
the
error
was
a
formal
and
harmless
error
without
effect
on
the
substantial
rights
of
the
parties.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
i
maintained
that
the
language
of
the
rule
is
not
mandatory
and
i
believe
if
your
honor
will
allow
me,
i'll
bring
this
up.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
i
say,
since
this
last
case
with
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
been
decided
two
weeks
ago
that
although
it
was
accepted
on
the
grounds
of
excusable
neglect,
they
looked
into
the
merits
and
said,
"there
is
no
reason
to
accept
it
as
accept
it
on
appeal."
that
leaves,
the
troyit
robinson
case,
the
only
case
on
record,
but
under
the
circumstances,
i
believe,
we
can
rely
and
trust
the
judgment
of
the
judges
in
the
district
and
court
of
appeals
and
that
being
able
to
determine
which
cases
are
going
to
be
allowed
and
examine
the
circumstances
on
each
case
as
to
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
allow
them
to
proceed
further
under
the
circumstances
as
to
filing
in
late
when
it
comes
to
filing
a
notice
to
appeal
at
a
time.
the
government
insists
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out
that
the
appeal
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional
and
states
for
the
large
number
of
cases,
since
the
present
rule
became
effective,
have
uniformly
held
that
the
appeals
regardless
of
their
merits
of
the
case,
have
been
dismissed
and
regardless
of
the
excuse.
my
research
indicates
differently.
what
the
government
doesn't
tell
the
court
that
in
so
many
of
the
cases,
when
the
government
has
dismissed
these
appeals
and
noting
that
they
were
untimely
filed
that
the
opinions
also
include
the
words
that
the
merits
of
the
case
do
not
want
--
warrant
further
hearing
of
the
appeal
even
if
they
would
timely
filed.
that
perhaps
is
a
self
or
soul
searching
or
a
way
of
letting
the
judge
rid
himself
of
something
he
calls
conscience
within
himself.
another
point
that
i
find
fault
with
the
government
is
that
choice
of
cases.
where
the
courts
time
after
time
had
either
misread
or
unconsciously
misinterpreted
37
(a)
(2)
and
delivered
an
opinion
completely
incorrect
as
i
understand
it.
in
the
swihart
case
cited
by
the
government,
the
opinion
reads,
rule
37
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
an
appeal
must
be
taken
within
10
days
after
the
entry
of
the
judgment.
and
in
the
isabella
case.
and
the
one
so
strongly
relied
upon
by
the
government,
the
court
noted
its
opinion
thusly,
the
question
on
this
case
is
one
of
power
for
if
this
court
had
discretion
in
the
matter,
we
might
well
exercise
it
in
favor
of
the
prisoner
that
there
was
mistake,
inadvertence,
neglect
or
something
of
the
sort
is
plain
enough
and
if
there
were
in
the
present
rules,
some
general
provision
authorizing
a
court
to
grant
relief,
we
might
well
be
disposed
to
grant
such
relief
here.
i
think
there
was
some
general
provision.
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
"the
difficulty
is
that
the
pattern
of
the
rules
of
civil
and
criminal
procedure
relative
to
appeals
makes
it
clear
that
relief
maybe
granted
only
in
a
specific
case.
the
text
of
the
rules
is
too
explicit
to
leave
room
for
construction
to
meet
the
facts
of
a
variety
of
particular
cases
of
real
or
seeming
hardship
and
it
is
not
without
significance
that
no
provision
whatsoever
is
made
for
excusable
neglect.
mistake
or
inadvertence
in
rule
37
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
where
a
person
convicted
has
an
attorney,
the
notice
of
appeal
must
be
filed
within
10
days
of
above
notice."
in
this
case,
the
isabella
case
is
different
from
the
present
case
in
two
respects;
excusable
neglect
or
legal
excuse
for
neglect
was
not
authorized
reason
for
filing
the
appeal
after
the
10-day
period
and
the
district
was
never
asked
to
nor
did
it
ever
do,
according
to
my
research
and
according
to
the
record,
exercised
jurisdictional
and
discretionary
power
to
pass
on
the
question
of
late
filling,
under
45
(b).
mr.
i.
william
stempil
the
lawyer
in
the
case
professed
that
be
both
a
believer
or
a
follower
of
the
jewish
faith
and
of
the
seventh
day
adventist.
and
the
day
for
filing
the
brief
was
on
the
sabbath,
saturday
day.
he
told
the
court
that
on
leaving
the
office
on
friday,
he
left
note
with
his
secretary
to
pick
up
the
appeal
at
the
printers
or
have
the
printer,
when
it
was
finished,
deliver
the
appeal
to
the
court.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
on
saturday.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
it
was
not
done.
he
then
came
in
on
monday
and
used
that
as
a
reason.
if
the
court
does
ask
me,
i
did
ask
first
since
connected
with
the
isabella
case,
i
went
right
to
the
top.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
he
claimed
there
was
excusable
neglect
and
judge
medina
told
me
that
he
felt
that
it
was
excusable
neglect.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
and
as
far
as
any
of
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
government
where
the
opinions
read
that
the
appeal
must
be
taken
within
10
days,
that's
not
so.
the
rule
doesn't
say
that
or
even
mention
the
word
"must"
anywhere.
what
it
says,
that
an
appeal
by
defendant
maybe
taken
within
10
days
after
the
entry
of
the
judgment
or
the
order
appeal
from,
but
no
where
is
a
mandatory
words
"must"
used.
i've
been
under
the
impression
and
i
have
always
been
under
the
impression
of
the
statutes
that
require
acts
that
to
be
done
or
taking
or
effective
within
a
statutory
period
or
a
time
certain,
contain
the
words
"must"
or
"shall."
and
the
time
computation
under
such
language
could
not
be
extended
either
by
agreement
or
speculation,
but
where
the
rules
or
the
statutes
themselves
spell
out
exceptions
or
the
language
of
the
rules
and
statute
are
couched
in
words
such
as
"may"
then
the
court
has
no
mandate
to
apply
the
strict
interpretation,
but
has
the
power
to
hear
and
determine
and
exercise
some
judgment
and
make
some
determination.
that
the
court
can
do
what
45
(b)
(2)
says
it
can
do,
spells
it
out
very
plainly,
how
and
when
and
under
what
circumstances.
in
our
case,
with
reference
to
ms.
rosenberg's
notation
that
45
(b)
has
enlargement
of
time,
the
record
would
bear
me
out
that
at
no
time
that
we
ask
for
an
enlargement
of
the
period
within
which
to
take
our
appeal,
now
where.
and
in
the
instant
case,
judge
kurren
used
his
discretion
and
issued
the
order,
that
the
record
reflects
that
the
appeals
were
allowed
and
the
failure
to
act
was
due
to
excusable
neglect
under
the
45
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
i'm
going
to
go
off
for
the
(inaudible)
if
i
may.
if
this
problem
was
handled
systematically
as
well
as
in
the
humanistic
manner,
the
decision
reached
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
hard
to
understand.
the
initial
question
of
jurisdiction
maybe
decided
by
a
district
court
to
whom
application
is
made
and
that
is
the
law
and
i
have
the
supreme
court
authority
for
that.
and
in
another
case,
in
appellate
court,
the
supreme
court
said
that
an
appellate
court
must
satisfy
itself
not
only
of
its
own
jurisdiction,
but
also
of
that
of
the
lower
court
and
the
cause
under
review.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
they
first
had
to
satisfy
themselves
that
the
district
court
had
the
power
and
discretion
and
do
what
they
did.
then,
they
said
there
was
going
to
be
an
appeal.
this
court
also
said
that
it's
a
cardinal
principle
that
on
appellate
court
review
was
essential
to
avoid
grave
injustice
to
prevent
or
denial
of
the
essential
rights.
so,
perhaps
if
a
district
court
judge
couldn't
do
it
because
of
one
day
late,
he
couldn't
find
his
way
out,
then
was
up
to
the
appellant
court
--
the
supreme
court
to
see
that
the
man
wasn't
denied
of
the
essential
rights.
the
government
contends
that
the
right
of
appeal
in
criminal
cases
is
reason,
and
one
of
the
expressed
reasons
or
purposes
of
providing
such
rules
was
to
eliminate
the
long
delays
after
verdict.
i
say
here,
the
government
is
responsible
for
the
long
delay
because
if
they
hadn't
challenged
this
ruling
of
the
district
court
and
the
opinion
handed
down
by
the
court
of
appeals,
these
appeals
would
have
been
heard
14
months
ago
and
if
there
was
no
merit
to
it
or
to
those
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
disposed
of
them
very
expeditiously,
very
quickly.
on
page
27
of
the
government's
brief,
they
point
out
they've
been
unable
to
find
one
case
outside
of
the
district
of
columbia
which
has
interpreted
45
(b)
to
allow
post
expiration
filings
and
that
the
majority
below
have
cited
no
authority
for
their
holdings.
we
now
come
to
an
important
point;
must
there
be
authority
for
their
holding
when
no
authority
was
necessary?
i
did
point
out
in
some
of
the
instances,
the
ledworth
and
resinick
case.
the
government
contends
further
that
the
ruling
rendered
by
the
district
court
and
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
without
precedent.
must
there
be
precedent
before
a
court
can
rule
on
a
question
that
confronts
it
where
it
manifests
injustice
that
is
so
apparent?
i
say,
that
stare
decisis
has
it
place
in
the
law,
but
when
justice
demands
and
allows
a
remedy
as
it
does
in
45
(b)
(2),
i
say,
to
the
government,
they
ought
to
stand
aside
and
not
like
--
not
block
the
path
of
those
unfortunates
who
because
of
a
technicality
or
an
admitted
error
or
excusable
neglect
on
their
part
and
the
counsel
too
of
being
punished
for
a
crime
which
in
every
respect
they
all
blame
us.
18
years
ago
in
the
case
of
waring
versus
(inaudible),
there
was
a
case
decided
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
justice
vincent
writing
for
the
court
expressed
themselves
on
the
subject
vastly.
when
the
case
is
decided,
it
is
expected
that
people
will
make
their
behavior
conform
to
the
rule
it
lays
down
and
also
to
the
principle
expressed
insofar
as
it
can
be
determined.
this
is
true
whether
the
decision
is
to
be
regarded
as
the
law,
the
best
evidence
of
the
law
or
a
protection
of
what
the
court
will
do
the
next
time.
when
hard
cases
arrive
under
the
principle,
counter
principles
are
emphasized.
distinctions
pointed
out
and
the
determination,
what
are
significant
may
become
easier
or
more
difficult.
if
at
last,
the
first
decision
is
overruled,
then,
there
is
new
law.
better
reference
or
an
enlighten
basis
for
protection.
all
the
loose
ends
presented
in
this
discussion
on
the
effect
of
altering
the
law
can
be
pretty
well
tied
together
when
it
is
realized
that
the
law
is
not
an
exact
or
pure
science.
and
the
law
loses
its
vital
meaning
if
it
is
not
correlated
to
the
organic
society
in
which
it
lives
and
that
the
law
is
a
present
and
perspective
force
that
it
needs
some
stability
of
administration.
the
law
is
all
that
the
law
there
is
and
that
the
law
is
more
for
the
parties
that
for
the
courts
and
that
the
people
were
rely
upon
and
a
just
behavior,
the
court
is
with
all
the
law,
be
it
legislative
or
judicial
or
both.
these
considerations
should
guide
the
lawmakers
and
law
appliers
in
making
their
determinations
in
respect
of
whether
a
change
in
the
law
is
to
be
effective
only
for
the
future
or
for
the
past
and
if
for
the
latter,
to
what
extent?
and
these
considerations
should
be
applicable
to
both
sides
of
the
potential
litigation
civil
or
criminal.
so
that
we
may
have
our
rules
as
we
go
on.
it
has
often
been
said
that
the
living
should
not
be
governed
by
the
dead
for
that
would
be
to
close
our
eyes
for
the
changing
conditions
which
time
imposes.
it
seems
sound
to
say
that
the
living
should
not
be
governed
by
the
posterity
for
that
return
would
be
downright
chaotic.
so,
i
say
to
the
government,
“don't
worry,
what
might
happen
in
another
case
or
any
case
after
this.
determine
this
except,
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said,
what
the
district
court
has
said
in
their
interpretation
of
the
rules
and
let
it
go
with
that”
because
i
feel
that
the
batting
average,
for
justice,
for
date
in
the
united
states
is
pretty
nigh
perfect
and
i'll
take
my
chances
on
that
the
government
should
too.
there
are
certain
cases
that
the
government
ought
to
knuckle
down
to
and
say,
they
merit
the
interpretation
of
45
(b)
(2)
and
i
say
this
is
one
of
them,
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
i.
william
stempil
if
i
go
over,
two
or
three
minutes,
will
the
court
allowed
me
that?
mr.
i.
william
stempil
please.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
it
is
settled
law
that
its
laws
are
local
laws.
and
since
we
operate
under
federal
statutes
and
rules,
with
those
rules
having
the
same
effect
and
force
of
statutes,
why
should
the
government
ask
the
court
to
reverse
its
own
rules
in
a
situation
that
fits
so
compatibly
and
to
a
situation
like
this?
the
supreme
court
in
one
case,
said
it
would
leave
undisturbed
the
interpretation
placed
upon
purely
local
law
by
a
federal
judge,
where
the
reasoning
or
conclusion
of
the
judge
was
not
refuted
by
the
respondent
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
not
disagreed
with
the
holdings
of
the
judge.
i
have
two
more
minutes,
if
the
court
will
allow
me.
mr.
i.
william
stempil
thank
you.
in
interpreting
the
rules
in
favor
of
the
robinson
brothers,
both
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
have
said
in
so
many
words,
there
is
no
reason
and
logic,
no
reason
and
justice
or
any
expediency
for
limiting
the
time
during
which
the
court
may
grant
the
release
under
circumstances.
i
believe,
clinging
to
that
technicality
which
has
been
misinterpreted,
is
wrong.
they
ought
to
keep
in
mind,
justice
vincent's
statement
regarding
these
hard
cases.
fortunately,
we
live
under
the
system
of
laws
where
justice
is
not
as
hard
and
blind
as
some
people
would
make
it
out
to
be.
i
know,
i
come
to
the
right
place,
to
seek
and
secure
justice.
i
say,
that
45
was
written
in
a
way
it
was
written
by
the
people
to
take
care
of
situation
such
as
this
by
giving
the
court's
permission
to
exercise
their
jurisdiction
and
powers
of
discretion
to
allow
an
act
to
be
done
after
the
time
prescribed.
to
assert
otherwise,
is
to
worship
the
rule
above
the
principle.
i
was
asked
by
justice
whittaker,
how
i
felt
in
light
of
the
fact
that
he
as
a
district
judge,
felt
very
badly
that
he
had
one
day
to
consider.
in
our
almost
200
years
of
existence,
the
conviction
of
the
medicine
person
in
the
federal
court
is
rarely,
but
it
happens
because
human
beings
are
fallible
and
i
don't
know
what
the
government
and
i
hope
the
court
doesn't
want
the
government
here
add
the
robinson
case
to
its
list
and
i
have
one
more
statement
and
i
want
to
know
if
the
government
wants
this
court
to
believe
that
within
the
space
of
11
days
that
the
quality
of
innocence
or
the
opportunity
of
being
allowed
to
prove
one's
innocence,
looses
its
luster
or
that
the
aisle
or
that
the
eye
of
the
trial
judge
has
become
too
jaundice
to
rectify
an
apparent
miscarriage
of
justice.
i
hope
you
will
allow
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
to
stand.
