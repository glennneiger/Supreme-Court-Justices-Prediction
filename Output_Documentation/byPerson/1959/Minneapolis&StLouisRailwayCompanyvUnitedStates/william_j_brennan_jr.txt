the
only
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
that
is
the

j.
brennan,

the
only
thing
in
the

bearing
on
this
question?
justice
william

is
there
any
reference

william
j.
brennan,

you
talking
about
the

thought
that
under
the
agreement
between
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
if
pennsylvania
were
to
win
the
litigation,
kept
26%
of
stock
at
$100,
there
would
be
some
kind
of
adjustment
than
the
contract
with
santa
fe
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
understand
it,
still
notwithstanding
that
violation
approve
the
acquisition
by
pennsylvania
stock
â€“
