mr.
harold
j.
soderberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members
of
this
court.
the
state
of
minnesota
took
a
separate
appeal
as
did
the
state
of
south
dakota.
i
will
attempt
to
cover
in
whatever
time
i
have
left.
the
position
of
those
two
states,
the
attorney
general
of
south
dakota,
mr.
parnell
donohue
is
here
today
and
he
joins
with
me
in
the
presentation
that
i
have
so
far
as
the
state
of
south
dakota
is
concerned.
there
is,
of
course,
a
dual
system
of
regulation
federal
and
state,
both
of
which
have
certain
areas
of
responsibility
and
certain
areas
of
authority.
generally
speaking,
they're
both
to
promote
the
public
interest
and
as
i
understand
the
public
interest
in
the
matter
of
railroads,
it
is
to
--
there
to
provide
an
adequate
system
of
transportation.
now,
south
dakota
and
minnesota
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
to
represent
this
particular
public
interest
wish
to
emphasize
two
basic
concerns
to
the
court,
namely,
the
preservation
and
development
of
the
m&stl
and
the
preservation
and
development
of
the
peoria
gateway.
now
as
to
the
m&stl
in
our
exhibit
h77
we
have
shown
general
information
about
the
economic
contributions
of
the
m&stl
to
the
state
of
minnesota.
we're
not
so
much
concerned
about
those
as
its
contributions
to
our
transportation
system.
now
of
the
total
of
1397
miles
of
the
m&stl
system,
399
are
in
minnesota
and
154
in
south
dakota.
it
serves
57
minnesota
towns,
and
17
south
dakota
towns.
it
provides
the
only
rail
service
to
42
minnesota
towns
and
13
south
dakota
towns.
it
also
provides
the
only
mainline
service
to
the
peoria
gateway.
now
what
are
the
consequences
of
this
case
upon
the
m&stl?
first
of
all,
approval
of
the
m&stl
application
in
our
judgment
would
promote
both
the
federal
and
the
state
transportation
policy.
the
m&stl
has
a
shaky
economic
history.
it
had
a
20-year
receivership
and
was
nearly
dismembered
in
proceedings
before
the
icc.
presently,
it
is
financially
sound
and
we
believe
it's
fully
capable
of
handling
this
t&w
undertaking,
yet
it
needs
the
tp&w
to
remove
their
basic
weakness
which
it
has
which
is
its
need
for
diversification.
it's
primarily
reliant
on
agricultural
traffic.
m&stl
unification
with
the
toledo,
peoria
and
western
would
give
both
roads
an
increased
efficiency
and
improved
solicitation
and
would
give
both
of
them
a
chance
to
compete
better
with
larger
railroads
and
also
with
other
forms
of
transportation.
in
addition
tp&w
traffic
would
broaden
the
base
of
heavy
density
traffic
to
offset
the
large
areas
of
low
density
traffic
particularly
in
south
dakota
and
minnesota
which
we're
concerned
about.
on
the
other
hand
the
approval
of
pennsylvania-santa
fe
application,
we
think
would
be
undermining
both
the
federal
and
state
interest.
it
would
eliminate
all
of
the
positive
advantages
of
the
m&stl
which
i've
just
covered
not
only
now
but
possibly
forever
in
the
sense
that
this
is
its
logical
opportunity
for
expansion
and
always
was
considered
to
be
such
and
we
don't
see
any
other
immediate
possibility
to
diversify
and
so
on.
further
it
would
divert
at
one
point
about
$1,100,000
of
revenue
along
the
nemo-peoria
segment.
now
the
effect
of
that
could
be
possible
abandonment
as
was
justified
to
by
our
witness,
dr.
nightingale,
a
--
a
phd
in
the
field
of
transportation,
a
man
of
many
years
experience
and
mr.
carr
from
south
dakota
their
witness,
that
is
south
dakota's
witness
and
also
mr.
swanson
of
the
m&stl
suggested
the
possibility
of
abandonments
if
they
lose
this
revenue.
even
if
there
weren't
abandonments
there's
the
possibility
of
retrenchment
in
other
--
and
other
areas
which
we
feel
would
not
be
to
the
public
interest.
now
the
commission's
statement
with
respect
to
abandonment
from
minnesota
we
feel
gives
no
real
protection
to
minnesota
and
south
dakota.
it
simply
says
that
there
were
no
abandonments
presently
contemplated
and
that
in
any
event
there
would
have
to
be
an
application
to
icc.
mr.
harold
j.
soderberg
yes.
actually
minnesota
your
honor
this
map
doesn't
extend
up,
far
enough
to
cover
it,
but
--
and
i
certainly
don't
care
to
in
sense
stipulate
to
any
possibility
of
--
of
abandonments
in
minnesota.
mr.
harold
j.
soderberg
well
you
were
talking
about
what
would
be
their
--
so-called
low
density
branch
lines
in
minnesota
and
south
dakota?
i
think
that
the
lowest
densities
are
possibly
in
south
dakota
but
i
--
i'm
not
sure
just
exactly
which
lines
or
which
communities
i
would
say
were
the
most
particularly
concerned
about
these
towns
that
i've
mentioned
that
--
that
have
no
other
rail
service.
mr.
harold
j.
soderberg
well,
as
i
understand
that
for
station
closings
and
--
and
for
non-service
tracks,
the
--
the
public
utilities
of
south
dakota
or
minnesota
could
handle
it
otherwise
it
would
be
icc
and
of
course
we're
concerned
about
that
situation
too.
now,
we
think
that
the
real
answer
lies
to
the
promotion
of
the
economic
strength
of
the
m&stl
and
not
to
some
kind
of
an
answer
that
you'll
have
to
first
get
authority
before
you
get
benefit.
in
this
attitude
of
the
commission
we
feel
it's
particularly
distressing
in
--
in
view
of
its
contrasting
solicitude
for
possible
abandonments
along
the
wabash
where
there
was
no
--
no
testimony
that
there
would
have
to
be
any
abandonment,
but
only
that
there
might
be
some
diversion
of
traffic.
we
don't
think
that
was
a
fair
treatment
of
our
interest
where
we
had
three
witnesses
that
specifically
recognized
the
possibility
of
abandonments.
mr.
harold
j.
soderberg
that's
the
point
i'm
at
right
now
your
honor.
we'll
be
--
mr.
harold
j.
soderberg
fine.
well
the
importance
to
minnesota
and
south
dakota
is
--
is
the
fact
that
neither
minnesota
nor
south
dakota
is
ideally
situated
geographically
in
terms
of
railroad
movements
to
the
east
because
of
the
presence
of
the
great
lakes
we
have
to
rely
on
either
chicago
or
peoria
to
get
to
the
east.
now
it's
obviously
more
desirable
to
have
two
gateways
that
are
active
than
to
team
up
with
one
and
as
a
consequence
if
anything
should
happen
to
the
peoria
gateway
in
terms
--
not
of
its
total
disappearance
but
let's
say
its
decreased
effectiveness
or
ability
to
handle
traffic
through
it
while
that
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
interest
of
minnesota
in
terms
of
--
of
either
peace
time
or
national
emergency.
now
the
effects
of
--
the
effects
of
this
proceeding
on
the
peoria
gateway
as
we
consider
them
we
haven't
seen
no
application
would
result
in
vitalization
of
the
peoria
gateway.
first
of
all
the
outer
belt
concept
of
the
operation
of
the
peoria
gateway
to
avoid
the
congestion
of
chicago
has
been
in
--
in
large
measure
the
--
the
cause
for
success
of
both
the
m&stl
and
the
toledo,
peoria
and
western.
the
m&stl
has
no
other
gateway
connection.
its
economic
incentive
would
be
to
maximize
movements
through
the
peoria
gateway
in
competition
with
other
gateways
such
as
st.
louis
and
chicago.
the
success
of
the
m&stl
and
tp&w
unified
operation
would
depend
100%
on
a
promotion
of
the
peoria
gateway.
on
the
other
hand
we
consider
the
--
pennsylvania-santa
fe
combination's
proposal
as
resulting
in
stagnation
of
the
peoria
gateway.
the
main
interest
of
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
lie
in
competing
gateways
which
is
to
say
chicago
and
st.
louis.
their
divided
ownership
in
the
toledo,
peoria,
and
western
would
add
to
their
lack
of
economic
incentive
to
fully
exploit
the
gateway.
also
they
would
have
the
lack
of
--
of
the
intense
purpose
that
the
m&stl
and
--
and
the
western
operation
would
have
because
of
the
comparative
unimportance
of
the
operation
when
considered
along
with
the
size
of
the
rest
of
their
systems.
the
--
mr.
harold
j.
soderberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members
of
this
court.
in
order
to
preserve
sometime
for
a
rebuttal
by
the
appellants,
i
wish
to
conclude
my
argument
at
this
time.
for
the
reasons
partially
developed
in
my
arguments
yesterday,
i
wish
to
express
the
opinion
of
the
states
of
minnesota
and
south
dakota
that
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
here
seriously
threatens
the
economy
of
the
state
of
minnesota
and
south
dakota,
and
secondly,
for
the
reasons
developed
at
length
in
our
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
my
colleague
of
state
of
south
dakota
and
then
the
brief
of
the
(inaudible)
that
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
also
legally
defective
and
should
be
overturned.
thank
you.
