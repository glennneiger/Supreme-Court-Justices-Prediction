mr.

you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginnane.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
commission
specifically
find
that
--
that
this
--
that
the
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
purchase
was
more
on
the
interest
of
a
public
and
that
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
minneapolis
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
me
it's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
made
the
conclusion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
39.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
does
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
does
that
finding
hold
that
the
western
would
not
be
in
the
--
i
mean
that
the
minneapolis
one
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
32.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
counsel
to
say
though
there
were
extensive
modernization
improvements
of
chicago
that
would
--
would
make
that
traffic
of
that
way
much
more
--
more
attractive
to
other
customers
and
that
that
might
detract
from
their
interest
in
--
in
western,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
on
that,
mr.
ginnane?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
charge
me
that
way
but
the
only
thought
i
had
in
mind
is
this.
suppose
--
suppose
if
they
would
put
their
--
their
real
money
into
--
into
the
chicago
situation
in
order
to
keep
the
traffic
going
over
those
two
lines
of
pennsylvania
and
the
--
and
the
santa
fe
and
we
put
no
comparable
improvements
into
the
western,
would
it
not
thereby
make
the
chicago
route
more
acceptable
to
transcontinental
shippers
than
--
than
this
one
and
if
that
were
the
situation
might
that
not
be
an
inducement
to
them
not
to
keep
up
the
--
the
western
in
good
shape?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
don't
--
i'm
just
asking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
was
in
the
record
all
the
time,
i
don't
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
thing
that
struck
me
was
that
they
--
they
give
the
benefit
to
pennsylvania
and
the
santa
fe
of
doing
that
in
determining
whether
the
--
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
but
when
minneapolis
goes
to
cutoff
265
employees
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
reduce
the
cost
of
operation
and
then
it
said
$100,000
that's
just
brushed
off,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
there
any
finding
--
was
--
was
there
any
finding
as
to
how
cheaply
it
could
be
operated
under
minneapolis
and
how
cheaply
it
could
be
operated
under
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
they
make
any
on
--
did
they
make
any
general
on
it?
did
they
--
they
make
any
finding
as
to
whether
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
would
operate
that
railroad
more
officially
and
more
cheaply
than
minneapolis
would?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
compare
that
that
finding
was
a
fact
that
pennsylvania
once
owned
this
through
subsidiary
and
that
result
did
not
obtain?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
same
thing
hold
true
as
to
minneapolis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
when
they
rely
--
when
they
rely
on
the
promise
that
pennsylvania
and
the
santa
fe
to
carry
on
the
same
policies
that
mr.
mcnear
carried
on
do
not
motives
come
into
play?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
they
--
but
wouldn't
the
commission
be
obliged
to
--
to
look
into
their
--
their
motives
if
there
was
--
there
was
a
reason
to
believe
that
they
might
not
be
interested
in
carrying
on
--
on
those
same
policies.
it
became
affected
with
their
financial
interest
to
otherwise.
wouldn't
the
commission
be
interested
in
looking
into
those
motives
whatever
they
might
be?
you
see
--
you
said
that
the
commission
wasn't
interested
in
the
motives
of
--
of
the
pennsylvania.
it
seems
to
me
that
they
could
hardly
avoid
it
if
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
they
relied
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
they
relied
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
pennsylvania
to
--
to
carry
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
through
promise
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
policies
of
mr.
mcnear.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
customary
in
the
proceedings
of
this
bearing
to
have
competitive
bidding,
mr.
ginnane?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
the
--
the
only
reason
i
ask
that
was
because
i
understood
counsel
yesterday
to
suggest
that
they
--
that
they
wanted
to
have
it
submitted
to
competitive
bidding
and
that
the
commission
did
not
do
so
and
i
thought
he
said
also
that
they
were
now
going
to
pay
more
money
than
--
than
this
$135
a
share
for
the
stock
and
that
they
would
be
willing
to
pay
--
they
thought
they
would
be
able
to
pay
more
than
either
pennsylvania
or
the
santa
fe
could
afford
to
pay
because
by
the
organizing
the
line
as
they
saw
--
saw
fit
organize
it
that
they
could
save
money
on
--
on
operation
to
come
and
save
for
them.
now,
i
may
or
misunderstood
it
but
that's
the
way
i
understood
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
mean
by
that
that
if
a
small
line
of
this
kind
is
for
sale
that
it's
the
business
of
the
commission
to
--
to
prevent
it
from
getting
the
best
price
that
it
can
get
for
its
stock
in
the
interest
of
the
big
companies
that
might
want
to
buy
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
be
carried
to
the
extent
that
you
could
put
a
small
line
like
this
and
in
the
nut
factor
between
two
big
--
big
railroads
and
--
and
prevent
the
small
line
from
getting
a
reasonable
value
for
its
--
its
stock.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
they
say,
the
owners?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
is
it
the
--
is
it
the
purpose
of
the
commission
to
â€“
submit
it
to
--
to
get
into
a
squeeze
of
this
kind
where
--
where
two
big
railroads
can
get
it
at
the
cheapest
possible
price?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
fair
and
reasonable
if
there
are
other
people
who
are
necessarily,
if
there
are
other
people
who
are
--
are
legitimately
offering
to
buy
it
and
--
and
they'll
offer
considerably
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
i
understand,
but
you
can
eliminate
that
factor
either
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
they
--
do
they
know
how
--
do
they
know
how
much
minneapolis
and
some
of
these
other
companies
had
wanted
to
be
on
it,
might
--
might
possibly
bid
for
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
--
do
they
take
any
--
did
they
take
any
evidence
to
determined
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
whatever
--
whatever
price
that
you
purchase.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
is
there
any
--
do
they
have
any
hearing
to
determine
what
--
what
minneapolis
for
instance
might
be
willing
to
pay
for
this
in
the
last
analysis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginnane
what
--
well
what
is
the
legal
situation
if
this
case
has
affirmed
and
the
pennsylvania
wins
in
this
litigation
against
the
trustees
and
that
$100,000
would
the
--
would
the
commission
then
be
in
the
same
position?
would
it
say
that
the
$100,000
was
a
reasonable
bid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
then
in
this
proceeding,
the
--
the
price
that
is
paid
for
this
stock
is
not
the
business
of
the
commission
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thomas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
wanted
to
ask
you
was
it
decided
on
that
basis
who
wants
to
take
the
chance
because
if
they
--
it's
only
on
the
promise
that
you
folks
will
operate
it
according
to
the
mcnear
policies
that
the
commission
did
if
he
gives
you
the
railroad?
now,
--
now,
do
they
have
--
just
have
to
take
the
chance
instead
of
you
because
you
don't
--
you
don't
want
to
take
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
they
do.
of
course
they
do
and
i
wonder
if
--
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
minneapolis
would
mean
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thomas,
would
you
mind
addressing
yourself
just
a
moment
to
--
to
the
argument
that
counsel
yesterday
as
to
the
attitude
of
(inaudible)
which
he
said
consisted
of
a
person
trying
to
get
things
routed
the
--
the
chicago
way,
and
secondly
to
get
it
routed
saint
louis
way
and
then
neither
of
those
were
effectuated
to
permit
it
without
--
without
any
ill
feeling
to
go
across
western.
you
said
--
argued
something
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
part,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
that
was
the
terminal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
still
will
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
they're
going
to
maintain
the
same
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
policy
as
before.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
your
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
thomas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
swiren.
