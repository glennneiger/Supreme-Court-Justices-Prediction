mr.
max
swiren
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
this
proceeding
concerns
two
competing
applications
for
authority
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
acquire
the
capital
stock
of
a
small
bridge
carrier
known
as
the
toledo,
peoria
&
western
railroad.
i
brought
this
large
reproduction
of
one
of
the
two
maps
appended
to
our
brief
in
order
that
we
might
proceed
more
expeditiously
in
painting
the
picture
of
the
relationships
and
the
basic
problem
here
involved.
the
carrier
that
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
concern
crosses
the
(inaudible)
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
it
is
here
in
green
beginning
at
the
indiana
state
line
passing
through
peoria
and
then
on
to
lomax
and
keokuk
on
the
iowa
side.
it
is
240
miles
long
--
mr.
max
swiren
on
the
iowa
side,
yes
sir.
it's
240
miles
long
and
draws
its
strategy
from
the
fact
that
it
bridges
the
transcontinental
carriers
of
the
east
and
the
transcontinental
carriers
of
the
west
through
the
peoria
gateway,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
problem
of
what
we
mean
by
a
gateway.
the
largest
terminal
for
railroad
interchange
is
in
chicago
with
31
road
haul
carriers
and
a
large
number
of
switching
lines
serving
this
tremendous
industrial
complex.
the
next
largest
east-west
gateway
is
at
st.
louis.
at
both
points
there
is
a
break
in
the
divisions
of
rates
between
carriers.
mr.
max
swiren
certainly
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
max
swiren
that's
terminal
line
in
--
in
the
peoria
district
in
the
switching
district.
mr.
max
swiren
no
sir
it
is
not.
no,
there
are
two
switching
lines
in
peoria.
one
is
the
p&pu
and
the
other
is
the
peoria
eastern.
the
--
the
advantage
of
course
of
peoria
is
that
it
by-passes
the
congestion
and
delay
of
the
very
busy
terminals
in
chicago
and
st.
louis,
but
it
also
has
the
disadvantage
to
many
carriers
of
shortening
their
haul
and
therefore
their
divisions.
there
is
a
fourth
gateway
that
needs
to
be
considered
here,
which
is
the
decatur
in
combination
with
the
hannibal
bridge
over
the
mississippi.
that
combination
is
used
exclusively
as
shown
by
this
dotted
line
by
the
wabash,
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
99%-owned
subsidiary
of
the
pennsylvania
railway.
of
the
two
applications
of
--
were
pending
before
the
commission
are
one
by
the
small
carrier
that
i
represent,
the
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
railway
--
mr.
max
swiren
no
sir
it
is
not.
it
is
an
independent
railway.
it
has
a
$20
million
dollar
capital
and
revenues
at
$20,500,000,
a
plant
with
the
book
value
of
about
$72
million
and
just
to
get
the
orientation
it
compares
with
the
two
competing
lines
in
this
fashion.
it
has
1400
miles
of
rail,
but
lacks
density.
for
example
its
density
is
one
million
revenue
ton
miles
per
mile
of
rail
compared
to
the
national
average
of
almost
two
and
a
half
million
--
mr.
max
swiren
it's
larger
in
agrarian
road,
yes
sir
and
the
third
of
it
is
bridge
traffic
which
does
not
originate
or
terminate
on
its
line.
it's
dependent
upon
connections
with
other
lines
and
dependent
exclusively
if
i
may
say
upon
the
peoria
gateway.
it's
the
only
carrier
concerned
in
this
proceeding
outside
of
western,
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy,
which
is
confined
exclusively
to
the
peoria
gateway
and
that
is
one
of
the
key
aspects
of
this
matter
that
unfortunately
the
commission
did
not
take
into
account.
the
--
the
two
applications
made
by
the
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
railway
which
operates
its
mainline
from
minneapolis
while
it
moves
of
course
down
to
peoria.
it
has
branch
lines
as
the
court
will
see
to
a
person,
your
various
agriculture
areas
of
minnesota
and
iowa
and
then
extends
further
out
not
shown
on
this
map
into
north
--
south
dakota.
mr.
max
swiren
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
max
swiren
our
--
our
lines
goes
all
the
way
to
peoria.
mr.
max
swiren
it
stops
there,
yes
sir.
mr.
max
swiren
that's
part
of
the
--
of
the
western.
the
western
starts
at
effner,
and
the
indiana-illinois
state
line
runs
across
the
state
--
mr.
max
swiren
--
to
lomax
which
is
just
short
of
the
mississippi
and
then
down
into
keokuk
across
the
mississippi
and
iowa.
as
i
say
there
are
two
applicants.
one
is
the
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
and
i
may
say
that
in
order
to
get
a
proper
view
of
the
scope
of
the
other
two
applicants
a
reference
ought
to
be
had
to
the
first
map
attached
to
our
brief.
it
shows
the
broad
expanse
of
the
two
giant
carriers
whom
we
oppose
in
this
proceeding.
on
the
one
hand,
there
is
the
pennsylvania
railroad
which
is
far
and
away
the
most
powerful
and
largest
carrier
in
the
united
states
in
all
terms
except
number
of
miles
of
track.
it
has
10,000
miles
of
track.
it
has
a
billion
dollars
a
year
in
freight
revenues.
it
has
the
most
concentrated
industrial
origination
territory
that
the
country
has.
it
has
the
plant
facility
that
totals
a
$1,800,000,000.
it
has
density
a
175%
of
the
average
i
think
it
runs
4,240,000
revenue
ton
miles
per
a
mile
of
track.
in
addition
to
that
it
has
a
great
many
subsidiaries,
the
most
important
of
which
for
this
purpose
is
the
wabash
which
is
itself
is
five
times
the
size
of
minneapolis
and
the
wabash
is
a
very
important,
a
very
potent,
a
very
effective
competitor
of
the
western
as
the
court
will
see.
it
serves
the
same
purpose
of
joining
the
east
and
the
west.
the
pennsylvania
competes
with
the
western
by
concentrating
on
two
gateways.
its
first
solicitation
is
for
the
st.
louis
gateway.
the
second
solicitation
and
next
longest
call
is
for
chicago.
it
has
never
solicited
for
the
peoria
gateway.
let
me
say
that
again
because
i
want
to
make
this
perfectly
clear.
neither
the
pennsylvania
nor
the
santa
fe
which
now
seek
to
acquire
this
western
property
has
ever
solicited
traffic
for
this
gateway.
they
not
only
prefer
but
they
concentrate
on
their
own
longer
haul
gateways
which
are
st.
louis
and
chicago
in
the
case
of
pennsylvania
and
chicago
and
the
late
case
of
santa
fe.
now
this
map
does
not
show
of
course
the
full
scope
of
the
santa
fe
which
appears
on
this
small
map.
it
covers
12
states.
it's
the
third
largest
railroad
in
--
in
volume
in
the
united
states.
it's
--
it's
got
a
plant
of
$1,600,000,000,
$600,000,000
of
revenues
a
year.
it
taps
the
two
fastest
flowing
areas
of
the
united
states,
the
southwest
and
the
california
area
and
it
too
has
tremendous
manufacturing
originations.
64%
of
its
volume
comes
from
manufacturers
originating
on
its
own
line
and
that's
--
that's
the
profitable
and
the
--
the
very
strong
potent
weapon
for
dealing
with
other
railroads
because
the
originating
carrier
has
a
great
deal
of
influence
on
the
routing
of
traffic.
he
is
the
originating
carrier
deals
with
the
customer,
provides
the
service,
provides
the
cars,
provides
the
wealth
of
information,
in
--
in
short
does
the
day-to-day
servicing
and
is
so
--
and
as
a
result
its
very
close
to
the
originating
shipper.
mr.
max
swiren
without
--
without
meaning
to
avoid
the
question
let
me
say
that
i
think
the
word
contributed
is
unfortunate
--
mr.
max
swiren
-
because
that's
what
--
mr.
max
swiren
--
but
--
but
the
connection
--
the
connection
supplies
the
about
64
%
of
the
traffic
that
western
gets.
that
is
the
connection
over
here
in
the
east
with
pennsylvania
and
on
the
west
with
santa
fe.
and
those
connections
i
should
say
came
about
--
and
that
traffic
came
about
through
the
genius
of
a
man
now
dead,
george
mcnear
and
perhaps
this
would
be
a
good
spot
mr.
chief
justice
to
indicate
how
all
these
came
about.
for
33
years,
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
the
burlington
which
is
another
huge
western
carrier,
owned
the
western
property
jointly,
each
owned
50%.
and
the
interest
of
those
two
carriers
in
the
longer
haul
competing
gateways
was
such
that
this
gateway
dried
up
and
western
went
into
receivership
where
it
languished
for
10
years.
and
then
it
was
bought
as
two
strips
of
west
if
you
please
by
this
man
mcnear
who
advised
the
commission
of
the
time
he
made
the
application
to
acquire
the
property
that
this
railroad
could
never
prosper
as
long
as
it
was
--
was
in
the
control
of
the
carriers
with
whom
it
had
to
compete
and
that
was
the
situation
with
the
pennsylvania
and
the
burlington
and
he
demonstrated
that
very
graphically.
he
bought
the
property
in
1927.
in
less
than
two
years,
the
car
loadings
went
from
38,000
to
68,000
and
i
might
say
while
the
commission
says
that
there
is
time
at
least
a
time
relation
between
the
connection
at
lomax
with
the
santa
fe,
and
the
successive
western,
it
does
not
appear
in
the
figures
or
in
the
facts,
there
may
be
a
time
connection
but
no
factual
connection.
of
that
68,000
cars,
less
than
6000
cars
came
at
that
connection
and
at
the
same
time
some
burlington
traffic
was
lost
because
when
that
connection
was
made,
the
burlington
connection
at
this
point
was
broken
leaving
only
two
other
connections
with
burlington.
so
the
6000
figure
is
not
a
net
figure
and
even
that
is
very
small
in
relation
to
the
total
picture.
the
undisputed
fact
is
and
the
commission
found
that
the
pennsylvania
and
the
santa
fe
have
offered
passive
resistance
and
that's
an
interesting
term
because
we
--
we've
come
to
the
language
problem
in
that
connection
presently.
i
was
interested
in
hearing
the
opinions
of
the
court
this
morning
with
respect
to
differences
in
the
use
of
language
that
we
--
we
find
that
at
least
two
of
the
railroads
in
this
case
had
special
language
of
their
own
and
one
of
the
aspects
of
that
special
language
is
this
passive
resistance.
it
didn't
counter-solicit
as
they
said
but
they
tried
to
get
the
business
themselves
through
the
st.
louis
gateway
first
for
pennsylvania,
chicago
gateway
second
and
through
the
chicago
gateway
for
the
santa
fe.
mr.
max
swiren
that
is
correct
sir.
and
since
his
death,
in
1948
the
present
president,
mr.
cozard
has
continued
the
policy
of
independent
solicitation
and
the
property
has
continued
to
grow.
mr.
max
swiren
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
max
swiren
no,
sir.
under
the
approved
plan,
the
--
the
santa
fe
and
the
--
the
pennsylvania
had
promised
to
continue
the
present
management
and
have
promised
and
the
commission
took
them
at
their
promise,
that
they
would
place
the
connections
of
western
on
parity
with
chicago.
and
as
we
demonstrate
in
our
brief,
and
we
shall
show
presently,
with
the
court's
permission
those
promises
are
contradicted
by
the
president
of
the
pennsylvania
and
by
the
president
of
western
who
was
called
as
the
last
rebuttal
witness
for
our
side
that
they
were
pennsylvania.
mr.
max
swiren
that's
exactly
what
i'd
like
to
do
now
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
in
for
about
eight
or
ten
years
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
combining
the
minneapolis
with
western
as
a
natural
merger
that
the
president
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
this
--
of
the
pennsylvania
had
been
urging
it
for
years.
he
said,
“this
is
a
natural.”
that
is
the
light
word
he
used.
the
president
of
western
had
been
endorsing
it
for
years
and
i
might
say
that
those
endorsements
continued
up
until
the
moment
of
this
litigation
where
they
became
partisans,
they
changed
their
views
understandably.
it
had
always
been
regarded
as
desirable
to
combine
these
two
small
carriers
each
of
whom
was
interested
solely
in
the
promotion
of
the
peoria
gateway
and
had
no
competing
interest.
mr.
max
swiren
it
was
thought
desirable
by
men
such
as
the
president
of
the
pennsylvania
who
was
well
informed
and
the
largest
-
represented
the
largest
connection,
the
president
of
the
western.
mr.
max
swiren
that's
a
difficult
thing
to
join.
there
were
two
strong
personalities,
mr.
mcnear
and
mr.
sprague,
who
was
then
the
president
of
minneapolis
and
the
record
shows
that
mr.
symes,
the
president
of
the
santa
fe
had
great
difficulty
getting
them
even
to
speak
to
each
other.
and
this
--
that
it
was
the
clash
of
each
personality
that
apparently
had
made
impossible
to
effect
the
merger
at
that
time.
and
in
1954,
new
management
came
into
--
to
the
minneapolis
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
present
chapter.
the
new
management
immediately
began
seeking
to
acquire
the
western.
i
may
say
that
my
brother
on
the
government
side
didn't
read
the
record
very
carefully
when
he
said
that
the
trustees
of
this
--
of
the
mcnear
estate
wanted
to
sell
the
property,
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
came
in
to
buy
it
and
so
did
minneapolis.
the
--
the
picture
was
this.
minneapolis
went
to
the
trustees
month
after
month
after
month
all
through
the
spring
and
summer
and
fall
to
try
to
persuade
the
trustees
of
the
mcnear
estate
who
controlled
72%
of
the
western
stock
to
sell
and
made
offers.
and
they
got
no
place,
until
finally,
in
march,
the
trustee
said,
“we'll
now
consider
this
matter
and
we
will
come
back
to
you
in
40
days.”
in
the
meantime,
other
events
had
occurred.
in
the
first
place
it
became
known
that
the
--
that
interest
(inaudible)
to
minneapolis,
had
acquired
a
large
position
in
voting
trust
certificates
of
monon
railroad.
the
monon
railroad
is
this
brown
line
property
that
--
that
runs
down
from
louisville
to
chicago
and
that
it
also
has
a
line
that
goes
through
to
michigan
city.
there
has
for
years
been
talk
of
a
possibility
of
joining
the
three
properties,
the
minneapolis
and
st.
louis,
the
western
and
the
monon
which
with
a
bridging
of
a
gap
of
27
miles
would
form
an
outer
--
outer
belt
line
by-pass
at
chicago.
mr.
max
swiren
yes.
it
--
it
comes
from
the
minneapolis
to
peoria
to
western
and
then
there's
this
gap
that
would
have
to
be
bridged
with
27
miles
and
then
the
monon
that
comes
up
here
and
connects
with
all
of
the
eastern
carriers
and
also
carriers
that
come
down
from
michigan.
and
that
would
make
it
possible
then
to
move
a
train
on
an
affiliated
line,
went
around
chicago
without
any
switching
or
any
delays
or
any
duplication
of
service.
and
when
mr.
symes,
the
president
of
the
pennsylvania
heard
that
he
said,
“when
i
heard
this
grandiose
plans,
i
decided
to
put
an
end
to
this
nonsense”
and
those
are
his
words,
“and
i'm
going
to
get
permanent
protection
for
the
pennsylvania
railroad.”
and
with
that
sense
of
public
interest,
your
honors,
he
proceeded
to
--
to
buy
the
property
and
the
way
it
was
bought
was
this.
mr.
max
swiren
western
has
been
making
money
your
honor,
making
money
now
as
making
money
then.
mr.
max
swiren
at
the
time
at
which
we
speak
the
western
was
making
varying
amounts
running
from
$650,000
to
$850,000
a
year
net.
it's
a
fine
property
today,
in
excellent
financial
condition,
operated
well
and
functioning
well.
the
purchase
arrangements
that
came
about
were
these
-
wilmington
trust
company
was
the
corporate
trustee
and
there
was
an
individual
trustee
for
the
mcnear
estate.
the
corporate
trustee
shared
in
common
with
--
pennsylvania
and
one
of
its
subsidiaries,
one
director
and
shared
in
common
with
three
other
subsidiaries,
other
subsidiaries
of
pennsylvania,
three
directors.
at
that
interlocking
directory
served
pennsylvania
well
because
it
yielded
preference
in
the
negotiations.
i
should
like
to
make
it
clear
your
honors
that
i'm
not
complaining
about
a
failure
to
live
up
to
the
highest
ethical
standards
required
of
fiduciary.
mr.
max
swiren
sir,
it's
--
it's
even
more
than
that
under
the
--
under
section
10
of
the
clayton
act,
no
carrier
may
have
any
dealings
in
securities
with
another
corporation
with
which
it
shares
a
director,
if
the
amount
is
more
than
$50,000
in
any
year
except
by
competitive
bidding
under
rules
prescribed
by
the
icc.
that
was
not
done
in
this
case
and
as
we
shall
see
presently
the
commission
simply
found
that
the
act
did
not
apply
because
not
the
first
contract
but
the
second
purchase
contract
was
nominally
in
the
name
of
santa
fe
alone
and
that
brings
to
the
negotiations
at
their
next
step.
just
about
the
time
of
the
30-day
period
for
the
trustees
to
come
back
and
--
and
tell
the
minneapolis
whether
they
would
deal
or
not,
and
at
what
level,
without
words
to
the
minneapolis
the
trustees
entered
into
a
commitment
by
two
letter
agreements
to
sell
26%
of
western
to
pennsylvania
and
26%
of
western
to
santa
fe
at
a
$100
a
share.
immediately
minneapolis
heard
about
it,
its
chairman
communicated
with
corporate
trustee
and
said,
“we
told
you
that
we'd
pay
a
fine
price
for
this
property.
we're
prepared
to
pay
more
than
what
you
sold
it
for.
we'll
pay
5%
more.
we
don't
know
what
the
price
is
but
we
know
it's
worth
more
to
us
than
it
is
to
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
and
the
trustee
said,
“we're
sorry
it
isn't
even
worth
your
corporate
to
come
down
and
to
talk
us
about
it.
the
individual
trustee
then
intervened
and
said
he
hadn't
been
consulted
whereupon
the
minneapolis
sent
an
offer
to
pay
a
$133
a
share
as
against
the
$100
that's
been
paid
and
kept
that
offer
open
for
a
week
and
at
the
request
of
the
individual
trustee
who
said,
“you
need
not
worry,
we'll
not
let
you
down.
you've
made
the
market
for
us.
they
extended
it
for
two
weeks
more
and
on
the
very
last
day,
while
counsel
for
the
individual
trustee
was
drafting
an
acceptance,
they
called
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe.
pennsylvania
said,
“we
have
a
contract.”
alright
the
15th
contract
is
good,
we
don't
care
anything
about
that
repudiation
we're
going
to
stand
on
it.
santa
fe
then
signed
up
to
buy
a
100%
of
the
stock
owned
by
the
estate
and
expressed
its
willingness
to
buy
the
stock
owned
by
minority
shareholders,
something
minneapolis
had
always
been
prepared
to
do
and
had
announced
to
the
individual
holders.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
mr.
max
swiren
for
26%.
mr.
max
swiren
that's
right
sir.
so
that
so
far
as
the
--
mr.
max
swiren
well,
that
squabble
was
soon
settled.
the
--
they
were
all
partners
and
they
remained
partners
and
they
still
are
partners.
and
a
month
after
that
transaction,
santa
fe
entered
into
a
contract
to
sell
pennsylvania
half
of
the
stock
reserving
to
pennsylvania
the
rights
under
its
contract
which
it
is
now
seeking
to
enforce
in
--
in
the
court
of
equity
in
delaware
against
the
wilmington
trust
company.
that
litigation
is
going
on,
so
that
that
has
then
brought
to
the
commission
a
joint
application
by
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
to
acquire
the
stock
of
western.
at
the
same
--
and
that
price
was
just
slightly
more
than
the
offer
that
had
been
made
by
minneapolis
and
the
individual
trustee's
assurance
that
he'd
come
back
to
us
--
mr.
max
swiren
it
was
originally
a
$100
--
mr.
max
swiren
they
raised
it
to
a
$135
when
ours
was
a
$133
some
odd
cents
and
they
--
they
ignored
the
suggestion
of
--
of
minneapolis
that
we
would
be
prepared
to
enter
into
competitive
bidding
either
privately
or
publicly
for
the
property
because
we
were
certain
that
under
our
program
which
involved
economies
and
efficiency
of
operation,
the
earnings
would
be
considerably
higher
about
twice
as
high
and
therefore
we
could
afford
to
pay
a
higher
price.
the
surer
way
to
take
up
situation
permit
it
as
to
make
that
proposal
and
everybody
knew
what
that
situation
was.
but
the
wilmington
trust
company,
they
put
the
sale
and
the
application
then
came
before
the
commission
and
so
we
have
two
applications
before
the
commission
if
i
may
outline
them
briefly
and
what
they
contemplate,
and
then
i'd
like
to
state
if
i
may
even
issues
of
law
that
seem
to
me
present
in
this
case.
the
two
applications
are
these.
minneapolis
proposed
first
of
all
that
it
would
integrate
its
operations
with
western
being
concerned
only
with
the
peoria
gateway
having
no
competing
or
conflicting
interest,
the
integration
is
possible
so
that
instead
of
switching
cars
here
at
peoria,
that
needed
to
go
to
effner
or
anywhere
along
this
line
that
same
train
would
come
right
along
instead
of
yarding
it
in
two
different
yards
and
switching
it
four
times
(inaudible)
would
go
right
through.
there
would
be
integrated
service,
duplicate
yard
facilities,
shop
facilities,
traffic
facilities
of
counting
would
all
be
eliminated.
mr.
max
swiren
yes.
western
is
one
of
our
connections
although
we
also
have
connections
at
peoria
that
are
just
as
large
with
the
nickel
plate
and
with
other
roads
and
those
connections
would
continue.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
same
--
this
another
aspect
of
the
integration
would
be
that
with
respect
to
eight
different
railroads
we
would
be
enable
to
have
direct
connections
instead
of
switching
through
another
carrier
that
involved
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
max
swiren
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
max
swiren
oh
yes
and
what
that
means
is
a
saving
of
time
and
of
--
and
of
money
and
we
also
proposed
new
service
rights
which
western
with
its
relatively
small
traffic
could
not
justify
but
which
we
felt
we
could
justify
with
the
addition
of
our
traffic.
for
example,
we
proposed
a
connection
here
at
watsinka
with
chicago
and
eastern
illinois
which
would
open
the
way
to
the
south
and
the
southeast.
we
proposed
is
of
connections
with
the
illinois
central
and
the
gulf
of
mobile
on
their
branch
lines
to
open
up
connections
on
their
main
lines
so
we
could
stay
from
24
to
48
hours
on
a
shipment
and
that
would
make
us
competitive
we
thought
with
the
traffic
moving
to
the
south
and
southeast
and
in
some
respects
to
southwest.
so
our
program
contemplated
first
of
all
new
economies
and
efficiencies
and
we
estimated
by
a
detailed
program
submitted
to
the
commission
that
a
$1,770,000
would
be
saved
by
eliminating
the
duplicate
facilities
and
just
to
give
the
court
some
idea
the
magnitude
of
that
in
relation
to
properties
as
a
whole
the
total
expense
on
the
western
is
about
four
million
six
or
seven.
secondly
we
proposed
the
accelerated
and
the
added
service
and
the
new
service
routes.
third
we
proposed
to
unify
our
solicitation.
western
has
offices
in
19
cities
off
the
line.
we
have
offices
in
enough
more
to
make
it
35
as
a
total.
so
that
instead
of
soliciting
in
19
cities
for
the
--
for
the
western
property
we
would
be
soliciting
for
both
properties
in
35
cities
and
we
expected
to
intensify
the
promotion
that
way
particularly
since
there
was
no
conflict
in
this
promotion.
there
had
been
some
talk
i
might
say
the
possibility
that
if
minneapolis
ever
acquired
western,
it
would
abandon
this
west
end.
that
goes
to
us
in
our
briefly
clearly
and
specifically
before
the
commission
and
the
commission
found
that
there
is
no
intention
to
abandon
that
property
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it's
density
is
much,
much
greater
than
many
branches
of
the
minneapolis
and
it's
much
more
profitable
than
many
branches,
there'd
be
no
purpose
to
that
kind
of
abandonment.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
so
that
is
not
in
the
case.
the
commission
found
and
the
whole
of
the
testimony
shows
that
our
studies
demonstrated
the
value
of
that
line
and
that
we
have
every
desire
and
purpose
to
keep
it
and
promote
it.
on
the
--
on
the
other
hand
the
minneapolis
–
pennsylvania-santa
fe
proposed
no
change
in
operation.
they
promised
that
they'd
keep
the
same
local
management
that
it
would
continue
to
operate
and
that
posed
a
very
serious
series
of
problems
to
the
commission.
no
--
no
improvement
for
service,
no
economies,
no
change,
but
here
was
my
acquisition
that
was
being
proposed
by
the
two
most
powerful
competitors
that
western
had.
here
was
an
acquisition
proposed
by
the
pennsylvania
which
had
undertaken
to
acquire
this
property
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
stifling
competition
with
western
and
minneapolis.
and
here
was
a
history
of
pennsylvania
and
another
western
carrier
having
only
western
and
driven
it
into
the
ground.
it's
been
a
disaster.
well
your
honors
the
commission
handled
that
situation
in
this
fashion
as
to
both
the
motive
of
pennsylvania
to
stifle
competition
it
disposed
it
but
by
going
--
mr.
max
swiren
yes.
both
of
applicants
filed
applications
to
obtain
authority
to
apply
for
the
property.
in
keeping
with
the
rule
that
the
commission
had
established
in
a
number
of
cases
it
considered
the
many
minneapolis'
application
notwithstanding
that
no
contract
had
been
signed
because
the
circumstances
were
such
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
that
if
the
acquisition
could
be
made,
they
were
--
the
trustees
were
in
the
list
of
accepting.
mr.
max
swiren
no
sir
they
did
not.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
they
did
not
though.
mr.
max
swiren
no,
they
didn't
appear
at
all.
mr.
max
swiren
western
didn't
appear
at
all.
mr.
max
swiren
the
case
was
before
the
commission
on
two
applications.
a
joint
application
by
pennsylvania-santa
fe
and
an
application
by
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
alone
and
those
were
consolidated
for
hearing.
and
in
the
consolidated
hearing,
the
trial
examiner
decided
that
the
application
of
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
should
be
allowed
and
the
application
of
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
should
be
disallowed.
that
was
affirmed
by
the
fourth
division
of
--
mr.
max
swiren
it
was
--
it
was
a
full
hearing
of
five
or
six
days.
i
--
i
gather
from
the
record
i
wasn't
present.
mr.
max
swiren
and
then
it
went
to
the
division
of
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
affirmed
which
changed
the
--
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
there
was
a
hearing
before
it.
mr.
max
swiren
no
sir,
just
oral
argument
and
briefs.
it
then
went
to
the
commission
on
exceptions
to
the
report
of
the
fourth
division
with
the
request
for
oral
argument
which
the
commission
denied.
so
that
the
commission
as
a
whole
never
heard
even
the
arguments
in
the
case
it
had
the
record
and
i
take
it
was
raised
before
the
fourth
division.
and
it
was
in
that
posture
that
the
suit
was
brought
by
minneapolis
before
the
district
court
in
minneapolis.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
the
commission
was
unanimous.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
and
so
did
the
three
judges
of
the
--
of
the
statutory
courts
in
minneapolis.
mr.
max
swiren
that
was
done
by
the
--
that
was
done
by
the
commission.
those
conditions
were
proposed
originally
by
the
burlington
and
were
accepted
by
all
of
the
parties.
so
that
the
conditions
which
were
but
the
existing
facilities
and
routes
for
service
connections
should
be
preserved
in
all
respects.
those
conditions
were
proposed
by
the
burlington
on
the
first
day
of
the
hearing
and
all
the
parties
agreed
to
them.
i
might
say
that
my
friends
in
the
government
talk
about
our
rigid
acceptance
of
the
--
the
conditions.
we
accepted
them
as
soon
as
they
were
tendered
and
then
the
commission
adopted
them
as
they
had
been
submitted.
mr.
max
swiren
right
sir.
we
announced
that
we
were
prepared
to
accept
those
conditions
and
to
abide
by
them,
if
our
application
was
granted.
and
these
--
mr.
max
swiren
oh
yes
and
they
were
adopted
by
the
--
mr.
max
swiren
yes.
they
are
not
uncommon.
they
are
--
conditions
of
rather
general
use
and
purpose
and
they're
designed
to
keep
available
the
existing
routes
and
facilities
and
connections.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir
there
--
there
was
and
if
your
honor
wants
to
hear
about
it
now,
there's
no
reason
why
we
shouldn't
talk
about
it
now.
mr.
max
swiren
i
prefer
to
--
to
talk
about
it
in
the
--
in
the
setting
in
which
the
commission
dealt
with
the
subject.
mr.
max
swiren
there
always
are
labor
problem
when
you're
trying
to
save
a
$1,770,000
a
year.
the
--
the
commission
as
i
am
saying
had
these
three
problems
with
the
application
of
the
pennsylvania-santa
fe
before
it
got
before
it
got
to
the
question
of
a
comparative
hearing.
the
first
was
the
problem
of
its
purpose
in
acquiring
western
for
the
sole
reason
of
stifling
competition
that
it
dealt
with
by
ignoring
it
and
so
did
the
government
in
its
brief
and
so
did
the
pennsylvania-santa
fe.
everybody,
the
persons
let
to
the
subject
with
silence.
mr.
max
swiren
i
say
the
subject
that
has
been
brushed
with
silence
is
the
admitted
purpose
of
the
santa
fe
--
of
the
--
the
pennsylvania
to
acquire
western
for
the
stifling
of
competition
before
closing
the
competition
by
western
--
mr.
max
swiren
on
the
outer,
outer
belt.
now
there's
no
dispute
about
it.
it
was
admitted
by
the
president
of
santa
fe
so
that
the
evidence
is
here
but
the
commission
simply
ignored
it.
mr.
max
swiren
the
--
the
decatur
gateway
is
because
as
your
honor
would
see
that
leads
through
the
wabash
to
the
hannibal
bridge
crossing
the
mississippi
and
then
on
to
kansas
city.
the
other
two
are
lesser
in
importance.
the
springfield
gateway
is
--
is
an
important
gateway
but
of
lesser
importance
so
far
as
the
wabash
is
concerned
because
it's
opened
to
other
routes.
for
example
we
can
reach
the
springfield
gateway
through
the
chicago
and
illinois
midland
and
do
have
a
service
route
which
practically
rules
in
the
st.
louis
from
minneapolis
to
peoria
and
down
to
springfield
and
then
across
on
the
(inaudible)
so
that
the
springfield
service
route
is
open
pretty
generally
to
most
people
in
the
wabash
position
is
no
different
from
that
of
any
other
individual
carrier,
but
in
decatur
it
has
the
dominant
position
because
of
the
hannibal
bridge
controls.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
the
testimony
showed
--
the
testimony
showed
that
the
route
of
the
wabash
to
kansas
city
had
been
improved
and
its
time
accelerated
to
a
point
where
it
drew
traffic
away
from
a
combination
of
western
and
santa
fe.
so
that
they're
active
in
competition
and
successfully
in
competition
i
may
say.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
and
i
should
also
say
that
the
santa
fe
shortly
after
the
hearing
opened
up
a
new
facility
in
chicago
which
doubled
its
capacity
and
doubled
the
speed
for
handling
cars
and
that
has
tremendous
importance
because
in
addition
to
getting
the
higher
divisions
for
the
longer
haul,
they
now
had
the
opportunity
of
moving
a
large
volume
of
cars
through
on
an
incremental
cost
basis.
the
cost
of
facilities
there,
the
fixed
charges
are
already
there
and
the
only
cost
is
the
service
charge
of
moving
the
cars
through
this
very
efficient
expedited
automatic
yard.
the
--
i
up
in
negotiations
--
the
--
the
hearing
stage.
the
commission
then
--
then
had
the
second
problem
that
it
virtually
ignored
and
that's
the
history.
at
no
time
did
the
commission
say
that
the
incentives
which
the
pennsylvania
and
burlington
had
no
longer
obtained
because
there
was
some
change
in
circumstance.
of
course
there
were
great
many
years
that
have
passed
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
economic
self-interest
of
people
changes.
human
nature
hasn't
changed
in
the
last
40
years
so
that
railroads
are
not
interested
in
their
long
hauls.
they've
always
been
interested
in
their
long
hauls
and
higher
divisions.
it's
perfectly
natural,
perfectly
human
and
universal
in
its
--
in
its
application.
so
the
commission
ignored
the
fact
that
under
this
--
the
ownership
of
pennsylvania
and
a
western
partner,
this
very
property
dried
up.
and
the
incentive,
which
the
investment
in
this
property
provided
was
not
sufficient
to
overcome
the
advantages
of
the
long
haul
and
the
greater
divisions.
the
third
problem
--
mr.
max
swiren
that
--
that
is
true.
that
there
was
a
connection
and
the
connection
went
further
which
was
discontinued
at
this
point
at
the
same
time
that
the
lomax
connection
was
made.
mr.
max
swiren
it
--
it
was
a
connection
that
came
up
here
to
burlington.
mr.
max
swiren
yes,
the
--
the
western
connected
with
the
cb&q
here
at
burlington
and
iowa
and
that
connection
was
broken
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
gurley
the
president
of
santa
fe
at
the
time
the
santa
fe
connection
was
made.
mr.
max
swiren
burlington
and
chicago
and
also
had
them
both,
but
its
major
gateway,
i
think,
is
chicago
just
as
the
santa
fe
gateway
of
chicago.
now
the
third
question
that
the
commission
had
in
connection
with
this
application
apart
from
the
comparative
problem
was
the
fact
that
these
two
lines
were
named
the
most
powerful
competitors
of
western.
and
they
got
around
that
by
building
structure
on
two
pillars.
the
first
was
that
this
was
going
to
be
an
independent
separate
organization
running
western.
it
was
not
going
to
be
responsive
to
the
rule
or
self-interest
or
the
economic
well-being
of
the
--
the
masters.
that's
a
very
slim
reed
on
which
to
build
any
kind
of
structure
let
alone
an
important
facility
in
transportation.
there's
no
showing
at
all
of
any
case
in
which
the
commission
has
found
that
this
type
of
operation
could
function
successfully
in
defiance
of
the
self-interest
of
the
owners.
secondly
and
most
important
of
all,
the
pennsylvania-santa
fe
told
the
commission,
“we're
going
to
put
lomax
on
a
parity
with
chicago
and
effner
on
a
parity
with
chicago
for
solicitation
purposes”
and
the
commission
bought
that.
mr.
max
swiren
i
--
i
shall
do
that
sir.
mr.
gurley
was
asked
what
that
meant
he
is
the
president
of
santa
fe
and
his
language
was
very
explicit.
he
said,
“we'll
tell
the
shipper
that
we
would
take
the
traffic
either
at
lomax
or
chicago,
without
preference.”
mr.
max
swiren
without
preference.
mr.
daffey
the
–
mr.
max
swiren
without
preference,
they
had
no
preferences
as
to
whether
they
got
it
at
chicago
or
lomax.
mr.
max
swiren
well
that
they
were
willing
--
that
they
--
they
were
in
their
solicitation.
they
were
going
to
tell
the
shippers
and
i
think
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
--
to
read
you
what
mr.
daffey
said
and
this
appears
at
483
of
the
record.
it
is
the
purpose
of
santa
fe
to
advise
all
of
its
solicitation
forces
that
they
will
place
lomax
on
parity
with
chicago
in
their
solicitation
efforts.
he
then
said,
“we
would
not
solicit
chicago
preferentially
over
lomax.
we
won't
solicit
lomax
preferentially
over
chicago.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
the
shipper
could
make
it,
of
course.
but
the
--
mr.
max
swiren
that's
true.
mr.
max
swiren
but
--
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
originating
carrier
has
a
powerful
influence
with
the
shipper
and
his
advice
and
guidance
carry
straight
weight,
but
the
promise
was
made
to
the
commission
that
they
would
put
these
two
points
on
a
parity
and
pennsylvania
said
the
same
thing.
they
said,
“we'll
continue
to
seek
our
long
haul
to
st.
louis
but
after
when
chicago
will
be
on
parity.”
two
witnesses
gave
the
light
of
that.
mr.
max
swiren
well
mr.
--
perhaps
i
can
demonstrate
it
by
what
he
said.
mr.
max
swiren
no,
i
think
--
i
think
the
evidence
is
it
was
never
meant
in
the
sense
in
which
it
appeared
and
in
the
sense
in
which
it
was
bought
by
the
commission.
mr.
max
swiren
well
i
had
assumed
that
parity
means
equality.
that
soliciting
--
mr.
max
swiren
no,
in
the
effort
--
in
the
effort
to
get
the
traffic.
they
then
said
in
solicitation.
solicitation
is
the
effort
to
get
the
--
mr.
max
swiren
no,
that
the
solicitors
would
--
would
ask
for
the
traffic
either
through
chicago
or
lomax
heretofore
they'd
always
ask
for
only
through
chicago
that
the
pennsylvania
solicitors
--
mr.
max
swiren
it
would
go
equally
--
mr.
max
swiren
equally
well
under
the
solicitation.
mr.
max
swiren
they
would
not
urge
chicago
over
lomax
and
wouldn't
urge
lomax
over
chicago.
at
--
at
least
that's
what
i
would
understand
parity
or
solicitation
to
mean.
now
when
we
went
through
the
record
we
found
this
situation.
mr.
symes,
the
president
of
pennsylvania
said,
“well
i
don't
think
there's
going
to
be
the
real
change
after
this
over.
if
anybody
asked
me
where
to
send
the
car,
i'd
say
send
it
through
st.
louis.
if
i
couldn't
it
to
send
it
through
st.
louis
i'll
tell
them
send
it
through
chicago.
and
then
if
i
couldn't
get
them
to
go
through
chicago
then
i
would
let
it
go
through
effner.”
so
that
the
parity
--
mr.
max
swiren
he
said
first
st.
louis,
second
--
mr.
max
swiren
he
said
that
on
the
witness
stand.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir,
this
--
well
that's
what
he
testified
to.
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
max
swiren
three
men
made
that
on
the
witness
stand.
mr.
max
swiren
mr.
gurley,
the
president
of
santa
fe,
mr.
daffey
the
traffic
vice
president
of
santa
fe,
mr.
coffey,
the
traffic
vice
president
of
pennsylvania.
now
mr.
--
mr.
max
swiren
well,
mr.
symes
first
said
what
i
quoted
him
in
saying
and
later
on
he
said,
“well
they
are
all
three
about
the
same
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
i
don't
think
they
make
much
difference.”
then
the
final
witness
really
explained
it
because
is
turned
out
that
we
were
talking
that
we
were
involved
in
a
special
problem
of
semantics
because
mr.
coulter
the
president
of
western
was
called
as
the
final
rebuttal
witness
for
the
successful
applicants
and
he
said,
“parity
doesn't
mean
that
they'll
solicit
at
all.
they
are
never
going
to
solicit
upon
the
freight
for
western.
nobody
that
works
for
pennsylvania
or
santa
fe
is
going
to
try
to
get
freight
to
go
through
the
peoria
gateway.
what
parity
means
is
benevolence.”
now
we
asked
him
what
has
been
the
attitude
up
to
now
that
was
--
that
ultimately
was
described
by
the
commission
as
passive
resistance.
he
says
benevolence
and
he
said
benevolence
and
parity
are
synonymous.
the
commission
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
that.
it
made
the
finding
which
it
took
verbatim
out
of
the
briefs
of
santa
fe,
pennsylvania
and
i'd
like
to
read
that
finding
on
page
34
of
the
record.
they
said
if
santa
fe
obtains
a
half
interest
in
western,
it
intends
to
place
lomax
on
parity
which
chicago
from
a
solicitation
standpoint
and
as
the
other
half-owner
the
pennsylvania
will
recognize
effner
as
one
of
its
principal
interchanges
along
with
chicago
and
st.
louis.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
while
pennsylvania
will
continue
to
solicit
its
long
haul
to
st.
louis,
effner
and
chicago
will
be
on
parity.
well
the
truth
is
that
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
parity
here
at
all.
i
could
have
change
a
thing
upon
keep
on
building
the
same
strong
competitors
they
always
were
and
it
isn't
going
to
change
their
method
of
solicitation.
mr.
max
swiren
i
--
i
can
well
understand
that
sir.
the
--
the
condition
that
has
been
obtaining
up
to
now
as
the
commission
found
has
been
described
as
passive
resistance.
mr.
daffey
of
the
santa
fe
said,
“that's
a
sort
of
friendly
neutrality.
it's
a
benevolence.”
then
when
mr.
coulter
got
on
the
stand,
he
is
the
president
of
western,
he
said,
“parity
doesn't
--
parity
and
solicitation
doesn't
mean
solicitation
at
all.
they're
not
going
to
solicit
for
this
gateway
at
all.
they're
not
going
to
object
if
a
shipper
wants
to
send
it
through
the
gateway,”
of
course
they
can't
object.
they
can't
stop
the
shipper
from
naming
any
point
he
wants.
“it's
a
kind
of
benevolence”,
he
says
and
he
was
asked
then,
“do
you
mean
that
parity
and
benevolence
are
synonymous”
and
he
said,
“yes.”
now
that's
the
state
of
the
semantic.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
i
may
say
--
i
may
say
that
they're
--
they're
referred
to
very
fully
in
our
brief
at
--
what
page
is
that?
well
i
know
that.
we're
on
our
brief.
mr.
coulter's
testimony
appears
at
1600
and
1609
in
the
fourth
volume
and
it
might
be
worthwhile
since
it's
very
short
for
me
just
to
read
that
testimony.
it's
revealing.
mr.
max
swiren
he
favored
the
acquisition
by
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
until
may
26,
1955,
the
date
when
the
second
contract
was
made
to
sell
the
property
to
santa
fe
and
then
santa
fe
to
pennsylvania.
up
until
that
point,
he
favored
that
minneapolis
acquisition.
after
that
he
said,
he
favored
the
acquisition
by
the
new
proposed
owners.
at
1600,
he
was
asked
whether
under
these
conditions
with
the
influence
of
the
pennsylvania
add
anything
to
the
influence
now
being
exerted
by
the
pp&w
in
santa
fe
on
a
movement
across
the
peoria
gateway.
he
said,
no.
question
-
why
not?
because
as
i
said
before,
this
benevolent
influence
of
the
pennsylvania
was
truly
after
a
gateway
which
is
present
policy
but
they
want
their
haul
to
chicago
or
st.
louis
which
includes.
and
then
on
1609,
he
was
asked,
“in
what
way
do
you
distinguish
between
parity
and
having
the
benevolent
attitude
toward
the
gateway?”
answer
-
“in
this
way
the
railroad
that
has
two
gateways
such
as
effner
and
chicago
are
not
provoked
if
we
get
the
haul
through
effner.”
“that
is
benevolent
attitude?”
answer
-
“benevolent.”
what
is
the
difference
if
they
are
on
a
parity?
answer
-
“that's
it.”
question
-
you
think
they
are
synonymous
then?
answer
-
“i
think
they
are
synonymous.”
and
so
if
this
testimony
given
by
the
witness
for
the
successful
applicant
has
any
meaning
at
all,
they
simply
perpetuated
the
hopes
on
the
commission.
there
isn't
any
parity,
there
isn't
any
solicitation,
we're
going
to
have
exactly
the
same
thing
that
we
had
before
active
competition
by
santa
fe,
the
pennsylvania
and
the
wabash.
i
--
i
think
in
a
great
deal
of
time
on
the
individual
--
i
may
say
that
the
subject
is
discussed
in
our
principal
brief
on
pages
40
to
42
in
our
reply
brief
pages
20
to
23
with
the
citations
to
the
record
on
each
of
the
witnesses.
there
--
there
are
other
aspects
of
the
--
the
comparative
hearing
that
are
significant
unless
the
failure
genuinely
to
make
a
comparison
of
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
two
applications.
there
was
no
effort
to
make
a
systematic
evaluation
weighing
and
balancing
of
the
advantages.
let
me
illustrate
it.
in
13
different
instances,
the
commission
found
--
made
no
findings
but
said
--
recited
the
position
of
minneapolis.
minneapolis
insists,
minneapolis
contends,
minneapolis
states.
on
economies
they
said
minneapolis
claims
economies
of
$1,770,000
and
those
were
specified
i
may
say
job
for
job,
facility
for
facility,
yard
for
yard,
office
for
office.
and
it
made
no
evaluation
to
that,
but
when
it
came
to
the
pennsylvania-santa
fe
application
it
said
with
representatives
of
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
on
the
board,
there
ought
to
be
able
to
find
more
economical
ways
of
operating
western.
this
indefinite
they
hoped
was
worthy
of
a
finding
but
the
$1,770,000
in
savings
each
year
was
not
dignified
by
any
evaluation.
nor
did
they
make
any
evaluation
as
to
the
public
service
aspects
of
the
improved
service
proposed.
the
commission
found
only
one
thing
about
that.
it
said,
“this
new
service
would
be
extremely
harmful
to
other
carriers.”
and
that's
substantially
a
quote.
the
only
citation
for
that
is
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
the
wabash,
a
subsidiary
of
pennsylvania,
that
a
“large
part”
of
6500
cars
a
year
could
possibly
be
influenced
away
by
minneapolis
if
the
connections
at
forest
are
improved.
now
the
connections
that
western
has
--
has
at
forest
and
they
were
talking
about
traffic
that
would
move
--
that
now
moves
as
he
put
it,
along
wabash
up
to
albia
and
des
moines.
the
amount
is
--
is
a
pitifully
small
amount
as
you
can
see
from
the
fact
that
the
wabash
moves
in
at
20,000
cars
a
year.
and
even
then,
the
wabash
was
not
able
to
say
how
much
of
that
large
part
would
originate
east
of
the
point
of
cutoff
at
des
moines
here
and
how
much
west
because
the
western
originations
and
destinations
could
not
possibly
be
diverted.
so
with
that
very
vague
and
definite
generality
about
a
very
tiny
movement
the
commission
said
the
(inaudible)
program
for
improved
service
is
extremely
harmful.
when
it
turned
to
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
it
knew
how
to
--
to
use
a
real
yardstick.
it
said
that
if
the
pennsylvania-santa
fe
improved
service,
and
as
a
result
divert
traffic,
it
will
not
jeopardize
the
ability
of
any
other
carrier
to
provide
adequate
transportation
service.
that
of
course
has
some
real
relationship
to
the
transportation
--
national
transportation
policy.
i
want
to
hurry
along
because
my
time
is
running
out
and
talk
about
the
labor
situation
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to.
in
an
industry
in
which
50
cents
out
of
every
dollar
goes
to
wages
you
can't
have
economies,
you
can't
have
elimination
of
duplication
without
affecting
wages.
it's
utterly
impossible.
the
commission
said
the
256
positions
would
be
eliminated.
that's
quite
true,
but
it
didn't
say
was
the
stability
of
employment
was
derived
not
from
the
number
of
positions
you
have
but
from
the
efficiency
and
economy
of
the
service.
that
if
a
gateway
dried
up
there
wouldn't
be
jobs
for
the
people
that
were
there
anyhow.
it
didn't
say
that
the
--
minneapolis
showed
that
on
the
basis
of
its
own
experience
with
the
average
age
of
its
executives
below
the
officer
level
at
64,
the
natural
attrition,
would
provide
vacancies
in
the
time
necessary
because
the
integration
couldn't
be
carried
out
overnight
to
move
these
people
into
other
positions
and
as
a
further
precaution
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
offered
its
application
to
adopt
the
washington
job
agreement
which
provides
security
for
employees
for
a
five-year
period
and
in
fact
permits
employees
with
five
years
in
service
to
get
a
year's
pay
--
a
severance
pay
if
they
want
to
move
another
job.
that
was
not
evaluated.
there
was
no
determination
whether
there'd
be
10
people
or
six
people
affected.
they
talked
only
of
the
256
positions
which,
of
course,
is
an
unrealistic
appraisal
of
the
problem
of
employment
in
and
of
itself.
i
want
to
move
on
to
point
two
if
i
may.
there's
much
more
to
be
said
about
the
lack
of
the
findings,
the
absence
of
findings
that
we
deal
with
in
our
brief,
the
failure
to
meet
the
obligation
for
a
comparative
hearing
in
the
true
sense
because
what
they
did
was
to
say
the
ideal
thing
is
to
keep
this
property
as
it
is.
obviously
that
can't
be
done
if
you
have
integration.
hence
the
pennsylvania-santa
fe
plan
was
the
only
one
to
be
taken.
there
was
no
effort
to
add
up
the
advantages,
the
disadvantages,
the
risks,
the
jeopardies
and
the
public
interest.
the
second
point
we
make
is
that
the
entire
transaction
of
pennsylvania-santa
fe
is
rooted
in
illegality
because
the
purchase,
the
dealings
in
securities
between
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
are
illegal
under
section
10
of
the
clayton
act.
now
the
commission
disposed
off
that
in
one
way
that
district
court
suggested
some
others.
and
i
think
all
of
them
were
interesting
but
none
of
them
very
helpful.
the
commission
thought
that
because
the
second
contract
was
signed
by
the
santa
fe,
it
was
not
a
transaction
between
pennsylvania
and
wilmington
trust.
i
would
think
that
having
the
partner
sign
does
not
immunize
the
transaction
but
more
than
that,
the
dealings
had
already
taken
place.
one
contract
had
already
been
signed.
those
were
the
foundations
for
this
transaction
so
that
the
dealings
and
contract
in
violation
of
the
statute
had
already
occurred.
the
court
thought
that
possibly
the
fact
that
pennsylvania
company
put
up
the
money
and
bought
the
50%
interest
and
was
not
itself
a
carrier
although
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
pennsylvania
might
immunize
the
transaction,
but
to
answer
that
we
need
only
look
at
the
application.
it's
an
application
by
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
railroad
to
acquire
control
of
western
through
the
purchase
of
50%
by
santa
fe
and
50%
by
the
pennsylvania
company.
so
they
met
the
reality
of
the
situation
which
the
court
was
unwilling
to
do.
and
because
the
commission
didn't
see
this
as
a
section
10
problem,
they
had
no
desire
or
need
to
inquire
as
to
whether
immunizing
the
transaction
was
in
the
public
interest.
now
it's
true
that
under
5
(11)
transactions
or
acts
necessary
to
carry
out
a
commission
order
are
relieved
from
the
restraints
of
antitrust
laws.
that
presents
two
problems
here.
one
is
can
they
give
condemnation
under
that
statute
to
an
act
that
is
already
illegal,
not
something
done
to
carry
out
the
commission's
order
which
is
what
the
statute
contemplates,
nothing
--
not
something
in
future,
something
that
has
already
occurred.
and
secondly
if
it
is
within
the
scope
of
the
commission's
power
is
it
not
incumbent
upon
the
commission
to
set
out
precisely
the
reason,
the
public
interest
consideration
that
warrants
overriding
the
policy
of
section
10
of
the
clayton
act.
we
come
finally
to
the
question
which
is
of
general
and
far
reaching
importance
and
that
is
the
extent
to
which
the
commission
is
called
upon
in
administering
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
accommodate
the
objectives
of
that
act
with
the
objectives
of
the
national
antitrust
policies.
let
me
say
that
that
was
clarified.
the
issue
was
clarified
for
us
by
the
government's
brief.
for
the
first
time,
the
commission
now
explains
what
is
added
to
this.
the
government's
brief
says
that
the
national
transportation
laws
were
adopted
in
replacement
or
to
use
their
language
in
lieu
of
the
antitrust
laws.
we
do
not
read
the
mclean
case
either
in
its
prevailing
opinion
or
in
its
minority
opinion
to
say
any
such
thing.
we
assume
that
the
court
said
what
it
meant
when
it
said
that
the
two
policies
should
be
accommodated
to
the
extent
that
they
can
be.
and
of
course
in
accommodating
the
statutes
the
economic
motivations,
the
purposes,
the
alternative
possibilities
that
the
second
application
presents
must
be
taken
into
account.
secondly
the
mclean
case
says
as
we
see
it
that
the
transportation
goals
maybe
permitted
to
override
antitrust
violations
if
positive
gains
are
--
are
achieved
in
transportation
and
if
competition
remains
sufficient.
and
that's
the
standard
i
may
say
that
the
commission
itself
adopted
just
last
year
in
the
(inaudible)
case
where
they
said
that
they
have
the
right
to
overrule
the
antitrust
limitations
if
affirmative
transportation
gains
are
affected
and
if
it's
necessary
to
achieve
those
gains
and
they
take
such
form
as
economies,
improvement
in
service
and
new
efficiency
and
provided
further
that
adequate
competition
remains.
if
that
standard
will
apply
here,
this
order
could
not
stand.
and
i
may
say
that
basic
to
the
commission's
error
in
this
respect
is
the
fact
that
it
--
it
played
around
with
diversions
of
traffic.
it
was
concerned
about
whether
one
carrier
or
another
would
lose
a
few
hundred
or
few
thousand
cars
of
traffic.
if
never
faced
up
to
the
full
sweep
of
the
antitrust
problem,
to
the
mechanism
that
was
being
set
up
here
that
would,
if
sante
fe
and
pennsylvania
already
pre-eminent
in
the
chicago
and
the
st.
louis
and
the
decatur
gateways,
virtual
domination
of
the
peoria
gateway.
it
never
faced
up
to
the
fact
that
we
were
dealing
with
gateway
competition
on
a
large
national
transcontinental
scale.
and
in
that
respect
it
failed
to
meet
its
obligations
in
determining
public
interest.
the
public
interest
could
not
possibly
be
assessed
without
taking
into
account
that
major
problem
of
gateway
competition,
the
major
power,
the
concentration
that
was
being
afforded
to
the
two
giants
who
had
undertaken
this
venture
for
the
deliberate
purposes
of
--
of
stifling
competition.
i
may
say
that
while
this
was
directly
shown
out
of
the
minds
of
the
people
of
pennsylvania,
the
santa
fe
morality
is
not
any
better.
the
president
of
santa
fe
testified
that
he
preferred
to
control
the
western,
rather
than
have
everyone
saying
they'll
purchase
and
that's
it.
mr.
max
swiren
in
part
that's
correct.
we're
saying,
sir,
that
the
commission
actually
did
not
explore
the
--
the
gateway
competition
and
it
was
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
doing
it.
mr.
max
swiren
they
--
they
do
not,
they
do
have
--
mr.
max
swiren
no,
sir.
they
--
they
--
mr.
max
swiren
well
sir
i
--
i
would
ask
that
question
too
about
the
whole
comparative
hearing.
how
could
they
reject
our
application
without
making
a
finding
as
to
our
service,
as
to
our
economies,
as
to
the
strengthening
of
two
small
carriers,
objectives
that
are
spelled
out
in
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
max
swiren
but
they
did.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
as
to
the
customers,
there
was
a
campaign
under
which
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
assembled
shippers
and
invariably
they
testified
that
they
came
at
the
--
that
has
to
the
santa
fe
or
pennsylvania
and
supported
them.
in
practically
no
instance
had
they
examined
our
application.
those
who
had
been
familiar
with
the
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
service
said
it
was
fine.
for
instance
one
of
the
mine
owners
who
appeared
said
he'd
be
delighted
if
he
could
get
a
car
supply
that
his
competitors
got
from
the
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
just
short
distance
away.
this
was
by
no
means
an
informed
opinion
of
people
competent
to
appraise
the
situation
and
the
commission
itself
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
appearance
of
shippers
or
the
absence
of
them
does
not
minimize
the
responsibility
of
the
commission
itself
to
form
an
expertise
judgment
and
that's
something
it
did
not
do
in
this
case.
mr.
max
swiren
no,
sir.
there
were
not.
i
think
the
--
the
facts
are
not
really
in
controversy.
there
are
no
basic
factual
problems
with
evidence
on
one
side
or
evidence
on
the
other.
we
have
situations
in
which
the
commission
has
simply
accepted
promises
in
derogation
of
the
economic
self-interest,
in
derogation
of
the
reality
of
the
situation
of
a
history
of
previous
conduct
and
that
kind
of
--
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
mr.
max
swiren
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
swiren
they
found
against
us
in
some
things
and
didn't
make
findings
in
others.
mr.
max
swiren
they
actually
failed
to
comply
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
max
swiren
that's
right
sir.
they
did
not
make
findings
as
for
example
the
economies
a
$1,700,000
of
economies.
they
didn't
make
findings
as
to
the
public
interest
and
the
improvements
in
transportation
that
we
offered.
they've
no
--
no
finding
of
any
kind.
the
closest
thing
it
came
to
making
a
finding
was
the
one
i
mentioned
the
--
that
some
carriers
might
be
hurt.
and
that
of
course
is
not
the
statutory
test
nor
is
it
the
test
that
they
themselves
applied.
they
--
they
used
three
different
criteria
i
may
say
for
diversions
of
traffic
as
we
spell
out
in
our
brief,
but
they
say
just
one
word.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
happened
here
is
that
the
commission
decided
in
advance
that
it
was
going
to
entrust
the
western
to
its
two
largest
competitors
and
it
was
going
to
ignore
the
purpose
of
those
competitors
in
seeking
to
crush
the
natural
expansion
of
a
small
carrier.
and
it
did
it
by
failing
to
have
comparative
hearings,
by
ignoring
the
policy
of
section
10
of
the
clayton
act,
by
failing
to
accommodate
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
transportation
policies
or
attempting
in
any
way
to
give
credence
to
the
natural
and
--
and
statutory
sweep
of
antitrust
prohibitions.
mr.
max
swiren
yes
sir.
mr.
max
swiren
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
that
they
--
their
connections,
they
are
the
largest
connections
but
the
solicitation
for
that
business
is
by
western.
what
western
does
is
it
solicits
business
from
the
east
that
would
move
in
over
the
pennsylvania,
over
the
new
york
central,
over
to
the
nickle
plate.
it
solicits
from
the
west
business
that
will
move
in
over
to
santa
fe,
the
(inaudible),
the
burlington,
the
rock
islands
half
a
dozen
other
carriers.
now
it
so
happens
that
the
largest
volume
of
business
that
it
gets
from
the
east
that
gets
through
pennsylvania
at
the
effner
gateway.
that's
a
perfectly
understandable
circumstance
because
of
the
fact
that
pennsylvania
dominates
the
large
industrial
segment
of
the
east.
pennsylvania,
however,
solicits
actively
for
first
for
st.
louis
and
then
chicago
and
its
volume
through
chicago
is
ten
times
its
volume
through
effner.
it's
five
times
this
volume
through
--
i
should
say
--
its
volume
in
st.
louis
is
five
times
its
volume
in
effner.
similarly,
santa
fe
solicits
only
for
chicago.
it
does
not
solicit
for
lomax
and
its
volume
through
chicago
is
10
times
its
volume
through
the
peoria
gateway.
the
traffic
that
it
gets
through
the
peoria
gateway
is
solicited
by
western
or
by
minneapolis,
which
alone
depends
on
that
gateway
and
which
concentrates
on
its
solicitation.
mr.
max
swiren
we
think
that
they
will
not
protect
it
and
we
--
we
think
that
our
self
interest
is
in
promoting
it
and
building
that
gateway
and
it's
for
that
reason
i
may
say
that
the
states
of
minnesota
and
south
dakota
had
joined
in
supporting
our
application
because
of
the
importance
of
that
gateway
to
them
and
their
knowledge
that
our
self-interest
is
in
promoting
western,
in
building
it
up.
we
have
no
other
interest
than
to
maximize
its
use
whereas
the
pennsylvania-santa
fe
are
interested
in
promoting
the
use
of
st.
louis
and
chicago
which
yield
more
dollars.
mr.
max
swiren
that's
couched
as
--
as
if
they
did
came
out
of
our
brief
only
in
better
in
language.
mr.
max
swiren
thank
you
sir.
mr.
max
swiren
your
honors
i
--
mr.
max
swiren
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
lay
one
ghost,
and
that's
the
matter
of
reprisals
by
other
lines
for
breach
of
neutrality.
if
those
are
sufficient
to
restrain
the
powerful
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
railroads,
how
can
they
be
less
effective
on
the
little
line
like
the
minneapolis?
and
let
me
say
to
that
these
fine
built-in
checks
and
balances
and
these
assurances
did
not
prevent
the
santa
fe
from
announcing
from
the
witness
stand
that
it
would
degrade,
degrade
the
connection
and
service
at
nimmo
so
that
it
can
get
more
out
of
the
divisions
on
the
lomax
connection
and
it
would
cost
the
minneapolis
well
over
$1
million
and
subject
to
another
$6
million
of
traffic
to
pair
with.
now,
the
testimony
given
by
vice
president
duffy
was
that
he
--
that
nimmo
would
cease
to
be
on
a
parity
with
lomax
in
his
colorful
words,
“service
wise
and
every
otherwise”.
and
if
that's
equality,
if
that's
preservation
of
rights,
i
don't
understand
this.
and
let
me
say
to,
that
the
only
two
items
of
our
application
upon
which
the
commission
made
any
findings,
they
didn't
make
on
--
on
service,
they
didn't
make
any
--
that
is
on
service
on
the
public
interest,
they
made
--
a
finding
that
on
this
western,
peoria
to
lomax
are
studies
confirmed
the
usefulness
of
the
property
and
we
had
no
intention
of
abandoning
it.
and
there
isn't
an
intimation
in
the
report
that
we
intend
to
degrade
it
in
any
way
and
we
wouldn't
have
any
purpose
for
doing
it,
it
is
much,
much
denser.
there
are
many
of
the
lines
in
south
dakota
and
minnesota,
the
counsel
for
those
states
are
here
to
defend.
i'd
like
to
in
the
brief
time
i
have
answer
three
questions
that
you,
mr.
chief
justice
put,
that
i
don't
think
were
met.
first,
was
there
a
comparative
finding?
did
the
commission
say,
the
--
the
pennsylvania-santa
fe
application
is
more
in
the
public
interest
than
the
minneapolis?
the
answer
is
no
and
my
friend
of
minnesota
called
attention
to
that
in
the
briefs
and
got
no
response.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
prior
ownership,
there
was
no
comment
by
the
commission
whatever
and
all
this
loose
talk
in
the
commission
report,
in
this
court
and
in
the
briefs
about
how
the
progress
of
western
dates
and
that's
the
word
they
used
from
the
lomax
connection
is
contrary
to
the
facts.
now
mr.
mcnear
told
the
commission
what
happened
when
he
asked
for
approval.
he
said,
not
that
they
didn't
have
a
good
western
connection,
but
he
said,
“it
was
against
the
interest
of
the
controlling
companies
and
i
interpolate
pennsylvania-burlington
to
develop
the
property
because
it
competed
for
traffic
with
their
lines.
that
was
the
reason
and
that
was
the
history”.
now,
there
wasn't
any
testimony
in
the
figures
that
justified
the
conclusion.
mr.
mcnear
came
in,
in
1927
and
by
1928
western
was
moving
68,000
cars
as
against
38,000
in
1926.
and
the
total
contribution
of
the
santa
fe
at
this
very
important
lomax
connection
was
less
than
6000
cars
and
those
figures
simply
belie
any
notion
with
the
rate
change
that
took
place
with
the
santa
fe
connection
and
i
may
say
that
those
figures
do
not
show
how
much
traffic
had
been
carried
by
the
burlington
on
its
western
connection
and
which
was
then
lost
by
the
replacement.
a
third
question
raise
by
--
by
the
chief
justice
that
required
answer
and
that
was
the
finding
on
savings.
the
commission
never
evaluated
the
proposed
saving
program.
it
never
said
that
it
was
wise
or
unwise
to
--
to
stop
using
two
yards
and
triplicate
switching
and
duplicate
facilities
for
repairs
and
so
on.
it
never
said
that
the
figures
we
gave
were
not
correct.
it
made
no
effort
to
meet
the
standard
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
transportation
policy
which
seeks
efficient
economical
transportation.
with
regard
to
this
degrading
at
nimmo,
let
me
say
that
this
is
a
--
this
was
a
matter
of
tremendous
importance
and
yet
the
commission
satisfied
itself
with
two
statements.
the
first
was
that
it
did
not
know
the
basis
for
the
percentage
of
loss
which
our
witness
testified
to.
let
me
illustrate
that.
there
are
$700,000
worth
of
traffic
between
peoria
and
nimmo
on
minneapolis.
the
witness
testified
that
he
expected
a
loss
of
75%
and
that
went
into
the
total
of
a
million
one
and
then
he
expected
a
lost
of
50%
on
certain
shipments
from
the
territory
of
santa
fe
and
the
territory
of
pennsylvania
and
then
as
to
the
bulk
of
the
rest
he
expected
10%,
5%
and
so
on.
now,
the
commission
--
the
counsel
didn't
cross
examine
on
that,
he
presented
the
figures
as
they
asked
him
to,
no
word
of
cross-examination
and
obviously
if
there
ever
were
an
area
in
which
the
commission's
expertise
cried
out
for
utilization
it
was
here.
if
they
didn't
think
it
was
75%,
they
could
have
a
judgment
as
to
whether
it
were
80
or
50
or
40.
that
was
a
field
in
which
it
could
function.
obviously,
this
is
opinion,
it
can't
be
anything
else.
secondly
the
commission
says,
“let's
not
worry
about
this.”
although,
they
were
worried
about
the
wabash
possibly
losing
minute
amount
of
traffic
the
details
of
which
the
wabash
did
not
elect
to
furnish,
they
said,
“let's
not
worry
about
this
because
the
service
is
inferior.”
well
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
western
the
service
at
that
time
was
15
minutes
faster
on
minneapolis,
saint
louis
and
it
made
the
connection
was
with
the
same
train
59
on
santa
fe
that
western
met.
it
was
bad
coming
eastward
insofar
as
the
connection
with
western's
concerned.
they
have
difficulty
integrating
their
schedules,
but
that
--
represented
a
very
small
part
of
the
traffic.
indeed
it
represented
only
13%
of
the
total
connections
at
peoria.
so
that
the
amounts
involved
so
far
as
the
greater
sums
were
concerned
were
clearly
related
to
traffic
that
moved
competitively
and
i
might
say
that
the
schedules
been
improved
so
that
the
(inaudible)
movement
is
two
hours
faster
which
shows
what
can
be
done
under
--
under
the
pressure
of
competition.
i
may
say
too
that
this
fear
of
what
the
great
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
could
do
is
not
without
foundation
in
the
record.
the
president
of
santa
fe
said
that
in
solicitation
their
effort
--
their
utmost
effort
as
he
would
it
--
would
be
tremendous,
and
of
course
it
is.
with
respect
to
section
10,
i
should
like
to
say
that
the
government
went
--
went
to
great
lengths
quoting
from
the
legislative
history
and
the
court
below.
today
they
abandoned
that
and
the
reason
is
perfectly
simple.
the
statute
first
of
all
was
directed
as
the
president's
statement
shows
and
the
report
show
to
strike
at
the
concentration
of
economic
power.
this
wasn't
to
protect
one
carrier
or
purchase
price
or
anything
of
that
kind.
and
one
of
the
features
of
that
attack
on
concentrated
power
was
to
attack
inter
corporate
directorships
and
the
first
draft
of
the
bill
simply
prohibited
transactions
between
related
corporations.
there
were
proposals
prohibited
of
--
interlocking
directors
and
finally
they
put
in
a
--
a
saving
clause.
they
put
in
the
$50,000
limit
and
of
saving
clause
in
order
to
meet
the
special
emergencies
but
that
did
not
change
the
purpose
of
the
act
which
taints
this
transaction
from
its
very
inception.
