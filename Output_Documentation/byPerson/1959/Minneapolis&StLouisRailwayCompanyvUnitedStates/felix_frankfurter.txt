it's
the
only
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
the
north
(inaudible)
i'll
call
this
north
where
i'm
going.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
stops
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
some
more
green
i
see
up
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
into
our
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
to
say
to
see
if
i
apprehend
what
you've
said
that
while
this
road
was
in
the
ownership
of
the
pennsylvania
and
burlington,
for
practical
purpose
is
that
the
business
on
the
road
was
dried
up
until
your
mr.
mcnear
acquired
it.
it
went
into
bankruptcy
and
it
was
sold
to
him
or
--
or
the
reorganization
turned
to
him
with
the
permission
of
the
icc
and
thereafter
began
to
build
up
businesses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
fill
the
gap
a
little
later
by
telling
us
how
the
present
situation
arose,
namely,
how
the
present
plan
of
re-acquisition
certainly
by
the
pennsylvania
and
the
new
center
that
they
came
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
mcnear,
was
he
concerned
with
--
did
he
have
the
desire
to
merge
with
somebody
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
the
western
been
making
money?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
that
which
you
speak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
interlocking
had
--
they
have
the
approval
of
the
icc,
does
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
lost
you
mr.
swiren.
the
santa
fe
was
prepared
that
â€“
they
would
buy
buy
it
100%?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
having
--
having
the
pennsylvania
you've
just
told
us
that
we
--
we've
got
a
prior
commitment
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
those
two
got
in
this
problem,
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
it
was
$100?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
raised
it
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me,
wasn't
the
western
know
that
connection
for
the
eastern
traffic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand.
was
this
case
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
hearing
was
that
before
the
examiner,
extended
hearings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
it
went
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
hearing
before
it
or
did
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
human
test
--
human
testimony,
human
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
the
--
commission--
was
the
commission
unanimous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
fourth
division
unanimous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
examiner,
the
fourth
division
and
the
full
commission
all
decided
against
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
labor
problem
in
connection
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
you
--
you
do
very
well
as
i
may
say
in
your
own
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
laws
be
contradictory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean,
just
trying
to
refer
into
concreteness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
shipper
could
make
that
choice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
shipper
could
have
made
it
before
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
promise
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
give
a
lie
to
other
men
something
that
could
in
the
future?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
say
it
with
slim
promise
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
we
contend
possession
with
here
have
to
go
to
lomax
rather
than
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
equally
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
would
let
chicago
be
desirable
most
extensively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
the
first
commitment
made
if
they
would
be
with
them
on
a
parity,
who
made
that
and
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
who
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
you
can't
charge
officially
against
mr.
symes,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
argument
of
yours
rests,
does
it
not,
mr.
swiren
on
your
rejection
of
the
commission's
finding
to
the
contrary
and
your
rejection
of
the
commission's
finding
to
the
contrary
that
if
there
is
no
--
no
basis,
no
allowable
basis
and
evidence
for
their
finding,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
of
their
opinion
but
they
don't
refer
to
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
terms
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
had
as
it
were
your
customers
before
them
didn't
they?
and
--
and
they
have
the
testimony
of
customers
who
are
feeding
railroads
and
make
claims
and
express
preferences.
now
is
that
relevant
to
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
any
offers
of
testimonies
on
your
behalf
that
the
commission
refused
to
hear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
which
there
was
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
testimony
and
--
and
the
commission
examiner
and
the
commission
directed
itself
to
those
problems
and
they
found
against
you
using
improperly
against
you,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
point
that
they
actually
failed
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
trying
to
find
these.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
your
position
is
more
con
--
a
little
more
concrete
than
that.
you
say
that
by
virtue
of
the
overriding
interest
that
the
santa
fe
and
the
pennsylvania
have
outside
of
this
new
acquisition
is
necessarily
will
have
to
supporting
them
the
interest
of
the
new
acquisition
to
their
major
interest
outside
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
had
the
benefit
of
not
reading
your
brief
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact
you
would
have
to
get
permission
of
your
commission
too
wouldn't
they
for
the
--(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
spoke
in
the
outset
of
your
argument
that
there
are
two
matters
concerned
to
you,
one,
was
its
effect
upon
the
peoria
gateway,
wasn't
that
one
of
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
you
deal
with
that
--
i'm
curios
to
know
why
the
state
of
illinois
isn't
concerned
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
relation
between
the
central
and
pennsylvania
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
santa
fe.
i'm
talking
about
(inaudible)
central
and
pennsylvania.
they
have
no
inter
corporate
relations
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
a
follow
up,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
--
had
not
--
had
not
been
in
the
past.
there
were
no
stockholdings
by
pennsylvania
in
central.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
fact
humanly
operate
adversely
to
economic
interest
of
western?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
indicating
in
a
minute
or
two
why
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
32?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
265
that
you
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
256.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
sizable
fraction
of
the
total?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sizeable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
is
confronting
the
distance
coming
on
the
railroad
only
unrelated
to
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
every
litigant
comes
up
all
the
witness
and
he
can't
say
it
side
but
what
extent
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
the
shipper
witnesses
for
not
dealing
to
appropriate
fractions
or
influences
i
don't
mean
anything
(inaudible)
to
use
powerful
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
do
generally
throughout
the
country
in
this
manner,
that
the
shipper
determine
the
route?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
also
sales
differences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
terms
of
section
5
and
that's
in
--
in
taking
--
taking
these
approvals
by
the
permission
out
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
the
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
take
into
account
competitive
factors
but
not
interdiction
of
the
sherman
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
couldn't
minneapolis
come
before
the
commission
and
make
it
all?
couldn't
it
make
a
proposal
that
the
commission
had
to
pass
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
matter
was
before
the
commission.
and
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
allowed
--
who's
to
be
allowed
to
acquire
under
what
conditions,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
condition
of
whole
scheme
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
to
make
the
commission
an
agency
for
determining
what
the
public
interest
is
subject
to
the
term
to
the
statute.
it
has
to
determine
not
only
the
responsibility
or
the
qualities
of
the
offer,
but
the
proponent
with
also
the
terms
under
which
the
proposal
is
made,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
equally
true
of
the
minneapolis
--
minneapolis,
minnesota
with
it,
with
the
other
road,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
not
within
the
--
i
don't
--
suppose
even
the
commission
--
i'm
not
sure
the
commission
has
power
to
require
competitive
bidding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane
whether
--
whether
transactions
are
within
any
of
the
antitrust
law
that
section
5
(inaudible),
are
usually
complicated
frankly
to
fact,
that's
certainly
point
but
it's
determination,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
gather
from
the
mclean,
it
isn't
a
business
of
the
icc
to
determine
whether
something
here
is
not
in
fraction
of
any
in
the
sherman
law,
not
the
business
of
the
icc
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
think
the
commission
can
(inaudible)
and
tell
me
a
words
none
of
the
--
business
of
the
sherman
law
to
design
where
there's
any
practice
with
any
of
the
antitrust
the
business
of
his
property
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
can
say
either
it's
different
of
violation.
so
that
to
discuss
whether
it
can
approve
of
something
which
maybe
a
violation
of
it
eminently,
if
it
will,
potentially
a
violation
is
irrelevant
to
the
job
of
--
within
the
function
and
the
jurisdiction
and
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
the
commission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
there
another
--
isn't
there
another
fact
of
relevance
in
price
element
if
the
acquiring
roads
--
that
the
price
which
acquiring
roads
pay
is
part
of
the
pressure
upon
them
in
the
use
of
that
which
they
acquire,
if
they
say
x
dollars
to
return
there
to
get
from
this
property
is
one
thing,
but
if
they
say
x+y
dollars
it
is
another
thing.
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
those
are
relevant
factors
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
say
to
the
--
or
what
proof
is
there
in
the
claim
that
when
pennsylvania
had
its
prior
connection
with
western,
if
--
if
i
mean
is
above
there
is
in
(inaudible)
western
and
there
is
a
momentum
in
that
kind
of
disfavoring
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
the
date
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1927.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
rates
are
the
same,
i
take
it
overall?
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
you
--
this
is
merely
by
way
of
--
by
way
of
negation
or
rebuttal
to
the
suggestion
that
the
--
that
--
that
the
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
having
interest
in
hostility
to
western
will
dry
up
that
contented
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
value
of
western
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
shippers,
that's
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
don't
need
to
acquire
it
in
order
to
protect
your
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
unless
the
--
the
minneapolis
they
want
to
take
a
chance.
