those
words
such
a
policy,
mr.
ginnane
refers
to
what?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
can
you
--
get
that
restrict
that
--
i
could
see
how
that
would
be
one
of
purposes
the
point
you
say
that
is
the
sole
for
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i've
been
reading
it
and
i
can't
quite
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
since
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
it
said
--
it
speaks
about
all
right
at
selling
or
--
purchasing
or
selling
officer
or
agent
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
is
this
it
--
let's
look
in
both
either
side
of
the
transaction
that
it
might
arise.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
--
the
shares
of
a
--
of
a
common
carrier
is
subject
to
the
judicial
commission
being
sold
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
your
contention
is
that
if
--
only
section
10
applies
only
when
--
when
a
carrier
is
--
is
--
it
is
selling
shares
not
when
a
--
selling
shares
--
not
when
a
carrier
â€“
carrier
is
acquiring
the
shares
is
that
--
is
that
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
easier
--
it's
easier
for
me
to
take
that
argument
than
it
is
to
take
your
further
argument
that
the
--
assuming
a
violation
of
section
10
which
is
a
penal
statute
the
commission
can
waive
it
or
condone
it
or
--
what
--
erase
it
or
forgive
or
wipe
it
out.

william
o.
douglas

what
would

justice
william
o.
douglas
before
you
do
that
interchange
that
would
be
the
fact
whoever
comes
in
this.
justice
william

douglas
it's
a

it's
a
physical

information

justice
william
o.
douglas
--
the
shipper

on
the
shipper
i
can
take
it
like
that
way

justice
william
