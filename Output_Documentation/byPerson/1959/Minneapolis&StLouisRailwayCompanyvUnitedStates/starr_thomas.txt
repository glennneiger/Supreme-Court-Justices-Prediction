mr.
starr
thomas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
planning
to
direct
most
of
my
argument
to
this
question
of
motivation
and
economic
interest.
mr.
ginnane
has
covered
it
at
some
extent
and
we
discussed
a
great
deal
yesterday.
the
appellant
says
that
the
economic
motivations
of
the
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
are
adverse
to
western's
route.
we
say
that
they
are
not.
we
say
that
those
economic
interests
of
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
will
lead
to
the
future
development
of
western's
route,
and
that
they
will
lead
to
its
preservation
as
a
bridge
line
working
closely
with
all
its
connections
and
therefore
avoid
harm
to
the
other
carriers
now
interchanging
traffic
with
western.
mr.
ginnane
said
the
motive
of
the
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
were
selfish
and
they
quite
agree.
the
commission,
of
course,
has
to
assume
that,
but
the
commission
was
aware
of
the
fact
and
it
said
so
in
this
report
that
the
santa
fe
had
established
the
interchange
at
lomax
in
1927
and
the
success
of
western
dated
from
that
time.
and
the
commission
knew
that
santa
fe
had
cooperated
with
western
on
the
west
and
the
pennsylvania
on
the
east
and
that
that
had
developed
a
large
volume
of
interchanged
traffic
between
those
two
roads
in
western.
now,
it's
quite
natural
when
the
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
learned
that
western
stock
was
going
to
be
sold,
they
wanted
to
buy
it.
to
buy
that
stock
to
submit,
they're
already
close
relationship
with
western,
it's
not
for
self
interest.
they
didn't
want
that
relationship
disturbed
or
destroyed.
it
was
a
good
thing
and
it
was
going
well.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
president
of
the
santa
fe
seriously
considered
purchasing
western
as
far
back
as
1942
when
it
was
shutdown
by
a
strike
and
they
noted
the
effects
of
the
lost
of
the
western
service.
so
the
thing
was
in
their
minds
for
a
long
time
and
the
mind
of
the
santa
fe's
president.
the
pennsylvania
was
less
interested
in
purchasing
western
more
satisfied
with
things
as
they
were,
but
when
the
time
came
and
the
stock
was
available,
they
felt
they
wanted
to
purchase
it
purely
out
of
self
interest.
the
commission
fairly
understood
that
because
it
said
in
substance
that
it
had
recognized
in
other
cases
the
fact
that
they
desire
to
protect
interchanged
traffic
was
a
valid
reason
for
purchasing
a
carrier.
mr.
starr
thomas
i
think
you
can
equate
too.
i
want
to
say
about
this
other
--
outer
belt
line.
it
was
not
in
this
case.
at
the
time
of
the
hearings
in
this
case
the
friendly
interests
so-called
to
the
minneapolis
and
saint
louis
had
sold
their
stock
in
monon.
no
plan
client
for
an
outer
belt
was
presented
to
the
commission.
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
it
was
feasible
economically
that
these
any
shippers
would
desire
it
or
use
it.
it
was
just
that
mr.
sims
had
not
wanted
to
have
such
a
line
competing
with
pennsylvania
and
the
reason
he
didn't
is
obvious
and
it
goes
right
to
this
protection
of
interchange.
the
monon
which
would
be
part
of
that
plan
comes
down
here
in
(voice
overlap),
down
here
crossing
in
pennsylvania.
now,
the
idea
was
for
minneapolis
to
be
combined
with
western
and
to
have
a
route
over
here
to
monon
and
on
up
here.
now,
this
line
between
logan
port
which
isn't
well
shown
on
this
map
that
is
right
here,
and
after
--
under
pennsylvania,
exists
solely
to
maintain
western's
connection
with
pennsylvania.
there
are
58,000
carloads
a
year
going
over
that
line,
that
was
figure
for
1955
and
pennsylvania
spent
a
million
and
a
quarter
dollars,
in
recent
year
upgrading
that
line
to
provide
faster
service
solely
in
connection
with
western.
now,
if
western
is
connected
with
this
line
over
here,
this
line
just
goes
out
the
window.
at
least,
there's
a
serious
danger
that
enough
traffic
would
be
lost
so
it
wouldn't
pay
to
maintain
logan
port
line.
so
really
that
opposition
can
be
equated
with
the
desire
to
protect
that
interchange
of
western.
mr.
starr
thomas
i
think
that
is
a
very
unfair
characterization.
i
understand
that
isn't
your
that
you're
simply
opposing
the
question
and
that
for
this
reason,
mr.
ginnane
talked
a
bit
about
it.
it
was
a
line
across
here
and
at
this
time
there
was
no
connection
to
santa
fe.
the
burlington,
with
its
main
line
in
the
peoria,
was
the
other
end
of
this
connection
between
pennsylvania
and
the
burlington
which
was
western.
exhibits
--
there
a
exhibit
in
the
record
here
that
shows
that
the
--
what
the
real
story
there
was
financially,
it
was
nothing
when
burlington
and
pennsylvania
first
acquired
it.
its
revenues
increased
substantially
but
not
enough
to
make
it
an
economic
success.
it
finally
went
bankrupt,
but
actually
its
revenues
increased
during
that
period
of
ownership.
they
didn't
decline
but
its
--
no
go
was
made
of
it
and
the
reason
was
that
burlington,
with
a
direct
line
into
peoria
wouldn't
have
any
interest
into
supporting
this
west
end
of
the
line
and
if
you
want
to
get
interchange
here.
it
also
has
a
line
in
chicago
and
a
line
of
saint
louis.
so
the
burlington
just
didn't
have
the
incentive
and
in
the
decision
in
which
the
commission
approved
the
santa
fe's
construction
with
western
of
the
lomax
interchange,
it
said
that
the
proposed
construction
would
aid
in
sustaining
the
west
end
of
western's
line.
and
the
story
we
have
today,
the
history
of
the
development
of
that
interchange
of
the
santa
fe
shows
that
it
did.
and
we
contend
that
santa
fe
is
the
factor
that
prevents
this
thing
from
repeating
itself.
mr.
starr
thomas
the
bankruptcy
was
in
1917.
mr.
starr
thomas
1917.
mr.
starr
thomas
oh,
pardon
me.
mr.
starr
thomas
that's
in
construction
by
--
construction
by
t.p.
&
w.
124
i.c.c.
278
at
279.
that
was
--
mr.
starr
thomas
1927.
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
that
was
the
date
of
the
construction
of
the
lomax
interchange.
now,
i
want
to
go
into
little
detail
about
the
interest
of
the
santa
fe
and
the
pennsylvania
in
western.
mr.
ginnane
and
everyone
who's
spoken
before
has
described
it
as
a
vital
and
strategic
route
and
there's
no
question
about
it.
it's
a
--
mr.
starr
thomas
it
might
or
might
not.
mr.
starr
thomas
it's
a
physical
interchange.
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
mr.
starr
thomas
that's
right.
mr.
starr
thomas
you
can.
now
that
santa
fe
is
concerned
about
the
feature
of
that
basically
because
it
has
a
working
relationship
with
western.
it's
gotten
the
connecting
service
from
western,
it's
made
that
route
successful,
it
rather
not
take
a
chance.
now,
this
route
means
a
lot
as
i
said
to
these
lines
particularly
to
the
santa
fe
because
of
the
transcontinental
traffic
that
has
been
developed
over
the
route
and
that
development
came
after
the
construction
of
the
lomax
interchange.
and
the
santa
fe
in
1930s
started
things
off
by
working
out
the
system
of
guaranteed
schedules
for
perishable
traffic
with
western
and
western
as
a
part
of
that
plan
constructed
icing
facilities
at
peoria,
so
that
the
service
could
be
properly
handled.
and
today
a
heavy
volume
of
that
traffic
is
moving
from
the
santa
fe
over
western
to
the
east.
now,
the
pennsylvania
--
mr.
starr
thomas
i
could
say
no.
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
i
suppose
there
are
other
ways
to
santa
fe
could
get
down
to
western.
it
could
connect
to
the
burlington
here
at
monon
and
get
down
or
galesburg
to
get
down
to
western.
the
point
those
are
not
routes
that
are
handling
any
volume
of
traffic
and
the
service
isn't
--
hasn't
been
set
up
to
handle
it.
it's
--
mr.
starr
thomas
oh
there
are
no
rate
problems
here
at
all.
i
want
to
say
something
about
the
pennsylvania.
i
mentioned
that
its
logan's
port
line
simply
exists
to
supply
the
connection
here
at
effner
with
western.
i
want
to
say
also
comparing
after
the
chicago
that
even
today
the
division
that
pennsylvania
receives
that
after
are
not
substantially
less
than
chicago
and
on
transcontinental
traffic
they're
almost
the
same
and
as
a
matter
fact,
if
pennsylvania
were
to
acquire
half
interest
in
western
on
the
basis
of
an
exhibit
presented
by
appellant
which
shows
the
divisions
of
effner
increase
to
reflect
half
of
western's
division
to
reflect
that
half
interest
in
almost
every
instance
shown,
there
are
about
170,
pennsylvania
would
do
better
via
effner
than
via
chicago.
mr.
starr
thomas
the
money
--
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
it's
what
they
get
from
rolling
traffic
on
their
share
of
the
haul.
now,
the
santa
fe
is
not
in
that
position.
the
santa
fe
interchanging
traffic
at
lomax
does
take
a
lesser
division.
santa
fe
has
a
reason
for
regarding
that
desirable
nevertheless
on
a
substantial
volume
of
traffic.
the
reason
is
that
santa
fe
serves
only
chicago
from
the
west.
its
competitors
the
burlington
and
the
rock
island
serves
saint
louis
and
peoria
and
chicago
directly.
now,
the
eastern
railroads
generally
favor
a
haul
to
saint
louis
because
they
get
their
greatest
divisions
there.
now,
when
the
route
--
traffic
is
hauled
to
saint
louis,
it
goes
west
from
western
--
on
western
railroad
serving
saint
louis.
the
first
place
they
get
to
the
santa
fe
is
kansas
city
and
most
of
them
run
west
of
kansas
city.
the
chances
are
in
many
cases
and
in
great
numbers
of
cases
that
traffic
--
whatever
comes
to
the
santa
fe
will
come
to
it
somewhere
in
colorado
or
texas
or
new
mexico,
arizona.
it
may
not
come
to
the
monon
and
that's
why
the
santa
fe
has
this
interest
in
western's
route.
it
gives
it
a
chance
to
get
traffic
away
from
saint
louis
and
that
also
relates
to
the
divisional
situation.
on
transcontinental
traffic,
peoria
divisions
are
equal
to
saint
louis.
there
are
lines
like
the
nickel
plate
and
the
new
york
central
running
into
peoria
connecting
with
western
there
which
serves
saint
louis.
they're
willing
easy
about
having
traffic
move
through
peoria
just
as
well
as
saint
louis.
western
solicits
that
traffic
and
the
santa
fe
on
the
other
end
has
a
chance
to
get
a
haul
from
lomax
all
the
way
say
to
california
as
compared
to
--
maybe
not
getting
the
traffic
at
all
from
if
it
went
by
saint
louis
and
certainly
not
getting
it
east
of
kansas
city.
so
that
santa
fe
is
interested
--
its
principle
interest
in
western
other
than
the
basic
one
that
applies
to
both
that
a
lot
of
important
shippers
like
the
route
and
they
like
the
service
on
it
and
so
they're
using
it.
and
--
and
that
service
is
definitely
the
result
of
santa
fe's
and
pennsylvania's
cooperation
with
western
and
it's
been
going
on
for
30
years.
now,
the
appellants'
counsel
says
that
the
--
this
business
over
western's
route
is
entirely
the
result
of
solicitation
by
western.
it
is
certainly
true
that
when
george
mcnear
took
over
that
road
he
did
a
magnificent
job
in
building
it
up
and
in
soliciting
traffic
for
it.
but
that
road
has
developed
into
bridge
line
primarily.
two-thirds
of
its
traffic
is
bridge
traffic
coming
from
one
railroad
and
going
to
another.
now,
you
can't
run
that
kind
of
a
road
if
you
don't
get
connecting
service
and
the
connecting
service
of
the
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
is
absolutely
essential
to
that
success.
and
the
--
mr.
starr
thomas
it
might
or
might
not.
mr.
starr
thomas
well,
one
of
the
reasons
well
maybe
--
maybe
western
from
peoria
east
would
be
just
as
acceptable
in
the
hands
of
the
minneapolis.
this
ends
the
lines
many
of
those
were
interest
in
the
case
about
would
not
be
so
successful.
it
might
not
route
to
santa
fe.
the
traffic
could
be
interchanged
here
and
go
down
to
peoria,
but
in
the
past
we've
--
we've
interchanged
western
was
struck
for
a
long
periods
beginning
in
the
end
or
world
war
ii.
i
mean
we'd
experience
with
that
traffic
there.
it
hasn't
filled
the
gap
in
--
in
early
1950s.
the
schedule,
one
of
the
shippers
in
california
mr.
yuri
sunkist
testified
that
they
haven't
said
at
all
--
haven't
maintained
the
connecting
schedules
to
provide
the
necessary
service
on
the
perishable
traffic.
its
uncertainty,
but
we
are
not
--
we
did
not
ask
the
permission
--
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
mr.
starr
thomas
it
would
be
in
interest
as
to
which
--
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
i
agree.
the
--
the
interest
of
santa
fe
and
i'm
speaking
of
here
though
is
from
a
different
approach.
in
other
words,
i'm
trying
to
show
the
court
that
the
santa
fe
has
a
selfish
interest
and
it's
been
demonstrated
by
providing
this
connecting
service.
they
didn't
have
to
do
that.
they
went
on
to
their
way.
they've
done
things
like
--
well
they
have
big
terminal
here
to
port
madison.
some
times
they
--
they
run
special
cut
of
priors
just
over
here
to
lomax
and
back
just
to
make
a
connection
and
to
keep
that
service
going,
because
they
sold
it
to
the
shippers
and
the
shippers
like
them.
so
we
say
and
the
pennsylvania
has
been
providing
the
service
all
time
on
the
east
as
shown
by
the
volume
of
traffic
that
moves
there.
and
we
say
that
santa
fe
and
that
pennsylvania
wouldn't
have
been
doing
this
for
30
solid
years
if
they
weren't
interested
in
western's
route
and
we
say
that
gives
reason
for
confidence
that
in
--
their
ownership
of
western
if
that's
approved,
western
will
be
secured.
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
mr.
starr
thomas
surely.
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
well,
why
did
we
go
on
this
way
for
30
years
if
our
interest
were
hostile,
that's
our
point,
that's
our
position?
mr.
starr
thomas
we
would
cooperate
as
long
and
giving
it
good
service
as
long
as
the
inner
connection
was
provided.
mr.
starr
thomas
we
don't
know.
the
minneapolis
plan,
as
i've
said,
had
the
aspect
here
in
service
within
pennsylvania.
we
also
know
that
it
--
it
seems
to
be
aimed
more
at
bringing
traffic
of
this
way
and
then
using
only
the
eastern
end
of
the
line
and
--
and
larding
traffic
up
this
way.
conceivably,
the
minneapolis
could
interchange
traffic
with
lines
like
the
rock
island
at
des
moines
or
somewhere,
conceivably,
they
could
let
the
connection
with
santa
fe
at
lomax
be
less
efficient
to
connection,
we
don't
know
and
we
don't
want
to
take
the
chance.
mr.
starr
thomas
that's
right
sir.
mr.
starr
thomas
mr.
chief
justice,
it
wasn't
just
on
our
promises
although
i
think
our
promises
--
promises
of
our
top
executives
under
oath
at
a
hearing
before
a
commission
that
regulates
everything
we
do
from
year
to
year
and
then
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
the
--
of
important
shippers
who
were
supporting
us,
those
promises
mean
something.
but
--
mr.
starr
thomas
the
commission
--
mr.
starr
thomas
the
commission,
as
i've
said,
its
finding
showed
our
cooperation
in
developing
the
route,
and
those
findings
reflect
our
self
interest.
it's
more
than
just
a
cooperation,
i
beg
pardon,
more
than
just
the
promises
and
these
findings
on
the
question
of
neutrality,
the
checks
and
balances
findings
of
mr.
ginnane
outlined,
that
finding
is
based
entirely
on
self
interest.
it
isn't
has
--
it's
no
connection
at
all
with
--
with
reliance
on
any
assurances
of
ours.
there
were
assurances,
but
the
checks
and
balances,
the
commission
said
afforded
the
protection.
the
fact
you
have
an
eastern
and
a
western
railroad
foreseeing
to
it,
each
one
of
its
interest
with
it
the
western
road
seem
that
its
interest
with
the
eastern's
connections
are
protected,
and
the
eastern
road
seeing
that
its
interest
with
western's
connections
are
protected
working
together
to
prevent
anybody
getting
hurt.
the
commission
analyzed
this
evidence
relating
to
the
question
of
neutrality
and
relating
to
the
question
of
the
effect
on
other
carriers
of
our
acquisition
did
made
findings,
they're
detailed
findings.
and
we
contend
without
any
question
of
a
doubt
bearing
in
mind
that
this
court's
function
as
to
such
matters
is
to
determine
whether
they
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
this
is
not
a
trial
de
novo
here
before
the
supreme
court.
the
court's
function
is
to
determine
if
there's
any
rational
basis
for
the
commission's
conclusion
and
if
the
findings
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
it's
not
a
determination
on
the
merit.
the
commission
is
supposed
to
have
that
function
as
this
court
has
said
any
number
of
times.
mr.
starr
thomas
that
was
the
--
mr.
starr
thomas
roughly,
that
was
the
traffic
policy
of
the
pennsylvania.
mr.
starr
thomas
yes.
mr.
starr
thomas
no.
mr.
starr
thomas
they
are
not.
mr.
starr
thomas
mr.
chief
justice,
the
discussion
on
this
--
this
is
the
parity
policy
as
it
was
called.
that
parity
policy
is
pretty
much
--
i
think
mixed
up
on
--
in
this
argument
so
far
and
i
intended
to
say
something
about
it.
the
counsel
for
appellant
said
that
this
whole
concept
of
parity
was
a
hoax
designed
to
mislead
the
commission.
and
the
commission
was
lead
to
believe
that
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
were
going
to
solicit
for
western
and
actually
they
wouldn't
solicit
a
pound
of
freight
for
western
and
counsel
said
that
the
commission
relied
on
our
brief
for
making
its
parity
finding.
this
is
not
the
precise
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i'll
get
to
it
in
a
second
--
i
do
want
to
bring
it
out
since
the
question
came
up.
mr.
starr
thomas
i
want
to
read
from
our
brief.
this
is
the
brief
before
the
commission
on
parity.
in
explaining
the
proposed
change
in
policy,
it
begins,
now,
the
policy
that
you've
mentioned
was
in
effect
on
the
pennsylvania,
and
on
the
santa
fe
the
policy
was
to
solicit
for
chicago
but
not
to
make
any
objection
if
the
shipper
decided
he'd
give
it
to
western.
in
substance
if
santa
fe
solicitor
said,
“give
us
the
freight
to
chicago”
and
the
shipper
said,
“i've
got
--
i
want
to
give
it
--
i'll
give
it
to
you
at
lomax”
and
then
western
and
santa
fe
says,
“alright”
that
was
the
past
policy.
under
the
new
policy
i'd
better
describe
it
before
i
read
this.
it's
in
this
description.
i'll
come
to
it
just
after
i
read
it.
in
explaining
the
proposed
change
in
policy,
traffic
vice
president
duffy
stated
that
shippers
will
be
advised
that
the
santa
fe
will
be
satisfied
with
routing
either
via
chicago
or
lomax.
in
other
words
no
choice,
it's
up
to
the
shipper.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
santa
fe
will
solicit
traffic
for
the
t.p
&
w.
that
would
otherwise
move
by
the
santa
fe
to
chicago,
but
what
it
does
mean
that
the
t.p
&
w.
and
its
connections
will
be
in
a
better
position
in
soliciting
for
that
traffic
against
the
santa
fe's
eastern
connections
at
chicago.
now,
i
think
that
pretty
well
kills
this
hoax
idea.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
santa
fe
will
solicit
traffic
for
t.p.
&
w.
--
for
western.
certainly
the
commission
was
not
mislead
and
it
didn't
find
that
santa
fe
or
the
pennsylvania
would
solicit
for
western.
what
it
found
was
that
the
parity
policy
would
make
it
powerful
for
western
solicitors
to
secure
more
traffic
and
that
is
what
the
policy
means.
we've
covered
it
at
pages
34
and
35
of
our
brief
where
we
have
reviewed
the
testimony
that's
supposed
to
be
in
contradiction
of
what
mr.
duffy
said
and
in
view
of
the
time
i
refer
you
to
that.
and
then
i
think
if
you
read
all
the
testimony
about
parity
and
read
the
--
the
transcript
references
are
shown
we'll
find
that
it
supports
mr.
duffy's
position.
the
--
the
situation
is
simply
that
when
the
shipper
knows
that
santa
fe
is
satisfied
with
either
lomax
or
chicago
and
that
pennsylvania
is
satisfied
with
either
effner
or
chicago
then
when
the
t.p.
&
w.,
the
western
solicitors
comes
to
this
shipper
and
says,
“give
it
to
us
at
lomax”
they
will
go
lomax.
maybe
a
shipper
--
maybe
a
solicitor
from
the
erie
railroad
at
chicago
comes
and
says,
“don't
give
it
--
give
in
t.p
&
w.
at
lomax,
give
it
to
us,
because
we
don't
connect
to
the
t.p.
&
w.”
maybe
the
shipper
will
give
some
of
that
to
the
erie
but
it's
up
to
solicitation
by
the
railroads
of
beyond
and
any
pressure
of
the
santa
fe
or
pennsylvania
to
route
--
to
get
the
traffic
routed
to
chicago
and
not
available
for
lomax
and
effner
is
gone.
that
is
the
substance
of
parity.
before
i
close,
i
want
to
comment
very
briefly
on
the
public
support
to
the
santa
fe-pennsylvania
application.
two
briefs
as
mr.
ginnane
said
were
filed
here,
one,
by
the
state
of
illinois,
and
one
by
the
municipalities
and
shippers
along
the
line
--
my
time
is
up.
mr.
starr
thomas
and
along
the
line
of
t.p.
&
w.
mr.
harry
begley,
assistant
--
special
assistant
attorney
general
for
illinois
is
here
--
illinois
is
here
at
the
counsel
table
and
he
would
have
participated
in
this
argument
but
we
deferred
to
our
understanding
of
the
court's
preference
for
only
two
counsels
to
a
side.
thank
you.
