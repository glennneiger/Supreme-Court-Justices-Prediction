could
you
trace
that
outer,
outer
belt
line?
justice
potter
stewart
now
somewhere
along
the
line
certain
conditions
were
imposed.
were
that
--
is
that
done
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
you
accepted
them,
if
--
if
you
were
to
be
successful,
you
--
you
agree
to
these
conditions.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
conditions
were
recommended
by
the
hearing
examiner
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
adopted
by
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
while
we're
on
this
--
this
factual
situation?
are
the
--
are
the
gateways
of
danville,
decatur
springfield
along
the
wabash
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
pennsylvania,
are
they
of
any
consequence?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
avail
transcontinental
traffic
across
from
the
wabash?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
wabash
is
wholly
owned.
they're
virtually
wholly
owned
by
pennsylvania.
justice
potter
stewart
now
at
that
time,
there
was
no
connection
for
that
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
texas
or
burlington.
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
the
--
the
western.
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
burlington's
gateway
at
chicago
was
the
major
gateway.
justice
potter
stewart
what
significance
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
are
these
possible
abandonments
be?
can
you
show
us
some
of
that
part
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
even
if
--
even
assuming
a
violation
the
subsequent
approval
by
the
commission
obliterated
it
so
far
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
you
--
you
would
say
they're
still
liable
to
criminal
prosecution,
but
the
--
that
the
approval
by
commission
erased
the
--
any
effects
so
far
as
this
acquisition
goes.
you
say
that
because
the
contract
of
purchase
was
conditioned
upon
commission
approval
and
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
not
been.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
goes
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
assuming
a
violation
that
there
was
involved
at
least
of
technical
violation,
if
you
will,
under
section
10.
now,
your
position
is
that
the
subsequent
approval
of
the
commission
made
this
acquisition
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
proper
even
assuming
the
violation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
depends
upon
what?
does
it
depend
exclusively
upon
the
fact
that
the
purchase
of
the
stock
was
conditioned
upon
commission
approval?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
it
--
doesn't
speak
in
futuro,
where
is
the
statute
â€“
it's
on
--
to
the
appendix
to
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
the
reason
that
the
president
of
pennsylvania
gave,
that
was
his
testimony.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
connection
at
nimmo
too,
isn't
there
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
minneapolis?
justice
potter
stewart
divisions
as
i
understand
it
as
carrier
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
share
of
a
total
freight
rate.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
that
be
--
wouldn't
that
be
true
in
who
say
--
in
--
in
whatever
hands
this
road
was?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
wouldn't
it,
i
mean
why
might
it
not
be?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
--
excuse
me,
my
question
is
upon
a
base
on
this
understanding
that
because
of
its
location
western
is
by
offering
nation
--
nature,
a
railroad
that
is
going
to
have
to
succeed
by
handling
bridge
traffic
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
over
head
traffic,
because
of
where
it
is
and
this
would
be
true
and
whatever
it
has
it
were
not
might
well
be
managed
or
badly
managed
but
apart
from
such
considerations
wouldn't
it
be
to
the
interest
of
whoever
owned
the
railroad
to
promote
and
solicit
this
bridge
traffic
from
all
carriers
and
all
connections.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
kind
of
where
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
then
wouldn't
that
also
follow
that
in
whatever
hands
western's
ownership
might
be,
it
would
be
the
pennsylvania's
and
santa
fe's
self
interest
to
continue
cooperating
with
that
railroad.
