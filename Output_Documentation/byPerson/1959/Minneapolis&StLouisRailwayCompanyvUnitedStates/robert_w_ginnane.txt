mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i'm
sharing
the
oral
argument
with
mr.
thomas
who
represents
the
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
railroads.
we
are
supported,
but
in
brief
only,
by
the
state
of
illinois
and
by
the
shippers
and
communities
along
the
line
of
the
toledo
--
toledo,
peoria
&
western
railroad.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
bring
out
a
few
additional
and
geographical
and
transportation
facts
from
the
appellants'
map,
because
this
is
truly
a
case
in
which
a
map
maybe
worth
a
volume
of
testimony
and
logic.
your
honors
may
follow
it
--
find
it
easier
to
follow
in
a
rather
simpler
map
which
appears
at
page
148
of
the
record,
that's
in
volume
1.
first,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
appellants'
historical
reference
yesterday
that
joint
control
of
western
by
burlington
and
pennsylvania
brought
it
to
ruin.
well
at
that
point,
the
suggestion
was
left
that
this
happened,
the
burlington
connecting
with
western
only
at
the
western
end
as
to
santa
fe.
actually
then
and
now,
burlington
connected
with
western
not
only
at
(inaudible)
but
by
this
route
just
north
of
minneapolis
route
coming
right
into
peoria,
with
the
result
that
burlington
was
directly
competitive
with
the
western
half
--
of
the
western
--
western
route
just
as
minneapolis
would
be
under
its
application.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
pennsylvania
route
here,
which
is
colored
so
heavily
simply
is
not
a
competitive
service
route.
by
that
i
mean
in
terms
of
the
condition
of
the
track,
the
grace,
the
curves
the
bridges
and
the
proof
of
that
in
the
record
is
that
in
1955,
western
interchanged
with
pennsylvania
at
peoria
240
carloads
at
effner
western
exchanged
with
pennsylvania
55,000
carloads.
i'd
like
to
point
out
also
that
two
real
competitors
service
routes
coming
from
the
east
and
the
peoria
are
nickel
plate
coming
all
the
way
east
of
buffalo
and
new
york
central.
now
they
are
real
competitive
service
routes
coming
from
the
east
in
the
peoria.
competitive
routes
in
the
practical
sense
that
they
are
fourth
and
fifth
respectively
in
western's
interchange
of
freight.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
pennsylvania
--
pennsylvania
and
santa
fe
are
first
and
second
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
sir.
they
were
--
they
were
talking
loosely
about
a
--
about
a
merger
and
this,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
according
to
newspapers
that
broke
up
in
a
bitter
dispute.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
nothing
of
any
consequence
and
i
don't
know
of
any.
they
are
independent
competitive
carriers.
the
commission
found
that
western
now
is
a
well-managed
independently
operated
railroad
furnishing
a
valuable
rail
transportation
service
to
the
public,
and
had
found
that
the
policy
of
western
has
been
and
now
is
to
maintain
strict
neutrality
between
all
connections,
and
to
participate
in
any
haul
of
traffic
long
or
short.
commission
characterized
western
as
an
overhead
carrier
through
peoria
as
an
alternative
route
bypassing
the
congested
terminals
of
saint
louis
and
chicago.
it
found
that
western
provides
a
vital
direct
way
essential
to
the
type
of
true
service
which
is
increasingly
important
to
shippers.
more
than
two-thirds
of
western
revenues
are
derived
from
overhead
or
bridge
traffic,
that
is
traffic
which
both
originates
and
terminates
on
other
lines
and
much
of
its
remaining
traffic
is
interline
traffic,
that
is
traffic
which
originates
or
terminates
on
other
lines.
the
commission
found
that
much
of
western's
conspicuous
success
as
a
bridge
line
dates
from
1927,
and
for
the
first
time
it
acquired
a
connection
with
santa
fe
at
lomax
and
since
then
the
cooperation
between
santa
fe,
western,
and
pennsylvania
has
provided
a
highly
successful
competitive
through
route.
and
the
result
of
that
cooperation
through
the
years
was
that
by
1955,
western
derived
70%
of
its
total
revenues
from
faith
interchanged
with
santa
fe
and/or
pennsylvania.
now
mr.
mcnear,
the
former
owner
and
president
of
western
died
in
1947.
this
entire
case
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
the
trustees
of
his
estate
for
the
diversification
purposes
desired
to
sell
most
or
all
of
the
western
stock.
apart
from
that
fact
practically
everybody
concerned
with
western's
existence
and
operation
would
be
quite
content
to
see
at
state
and
the
status
in
which
it
was
under
mr.
mcnear's
leadership.
it
was
against
this
background
that
the
commission
had
before
it
three
proposals,
the
proposal
of
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
for
50-50
joint
control
through
stock
ownership,
the
proposal
of
minneapolis
for
sole
control
of
western
and
the
application
of
nickel
plate
in
rock
island
to
be
included
in
multiple
ownership
with
any
successful
applicant.
a
consolidated
hearing
was
held
on
all
of
these
matters.
ultimately
the
commission
authorized
acquisition
of
control
by
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania.
minneapolis
and
nickel
plate,
which
is
no
longer
in
the
litigation,
challenged
the
commission's
order
before
a
three-judge
court
in
minneapolis
and
that
court
after
a
thorough
review
of
the
commission's
order,
sustained
it.
now,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
here,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
in
the
appellants'
briefs,
that
the
district
court's
action
was
not
perfunctory,
nor
wasn't
it
an
abdication
of
the
judicial
function.
that
court
in
minneapolis
patiently
heard
all
of
us
for
six
hours
and
we
submit
that
its
opinion
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
issues
presented
to
that
court.
now,
the
issues
have
shifted
from
time
to
time.
for
example,
the
principal
issue
litigated
in
--
in
the
district
court
was
the
contention
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
10
of
the
clayton
act.
here
the
principal
contention
seems
to
be
that
the
commission
denied
minneapolis
of
fair
hearing
by
determining
that
the
public
interest
requires
so
far
as
possible,
that
continued
separate
and
independent
operation
of
western
under
its
present
policies
be
assured
and
minneapolis
contends
that
that
approach
deprived
it
--
deprived
it
of
a
fair
comparative
hearing
on
its
application.
we
contend
that
the
commission
proceeded
properly
under
the
statutory
standards
and
the
standard
in
section
5
where
one
or
more
carriers
seek
to
acquire
a
control
of
another
carrier
is
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
that
is
defined
somewhat
further
in
section
5
which
says,
“the
commission
shall
give
weight
to
the
following
considerations
among
others.
first,
the
effect
of
a
proposed
transaction
upon
adequate
transportation
service
to
the
public,
the
effect
of
the
public
interest
upon
the
public
interest
to
the
inclusion
or
failure
to
include
other
carriers
--
other
carriers
in
that
same
general
territory,
total
fix
charges
resulting
from
the
proposed
transaction
and
for
the
interest
of
the
carrier
employees
affected.
stated
briefly
under
the
national
transportation
policy,
the
commission
must
take
into
account
every
relevant
interest
of
shippers,
carriers,
employees
and
the
nation.
the
commission's
report
starts
out
by
discussing
western's
physical
facilities,
its
traffic,
its
roll
in
the
transportation
system,
and
its
revenues.
then
the
commission
describes
the
applicants
and
the
intervening
carriers,
and
their
positions,
and
the
--
and
the
respective
applications.
the
commission
noted
that
the
santa
fe,
pennsylvania
proposal
contemplated
that
western
would
continue
to
be
operated
as
a
separate
and
independent
carrier
with
its
separate
management
continuing
to
be
at
peoria.
the
commission
found
that
the
minneapolis
proposal
contemplates
the
disappearance
of
western
as
a
separate
carrier.
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
commission
said,
“western
will
be
integrated,
consolidated,
and
merged
into
the
minneapolis
for
ownership,
management
and
operation.
western's
headquarters
would
be
removed
to
--
from
peoria
to
minneapolis
and
the
combined
railroad
operation
would
be
run
from
minneapolis.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'll
answer
it
this
way.
the
people
are
shippers
along
the
western
route,
its
employees
and
particularly,
the
shipper
is
another
interested
parties
and
the
western
half
of
the
route
which
would
be
in
direct
competition
with
the
minneapolis
present
route
would
firmly
convince
that
it
would.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
as
the
commission
found,
it's
important
to
shippers,
sometimes
for
real
reason,
sometimes
for
imaginary
reasons.
shippers
consider
it
important
to
have
ready
access
to
responsible
carrier
officials.
under
the
minneapolis
plan,
there
would
be
an
operation
superintendent
in
peoria.
all
the
other
officers
of
the
combined
operation
would
be
hundreds
of
--
hundreds
of
miles
in
minneapolis.
it's
--
as
the
commission
found,
it
is
a
factor
in
shipper
thinking,
shipper
fears.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
may
i
lead
up
to
that
in
the
moment
(voice
overlap)
--
the
factors
--
it's
by
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
by
enumerating
the
factors
which
lead
the
commission
to
that
conclusion,
that
waiver.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
make
--
they
did
indeed,
sir
and
that
finding
is
as
follows.
on
page
39
of
the
record
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
the
top
of
the
--
at
the
top
of
page,
we
are
convinced
that
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
operation
of
western
under
the
control
of
the
santa
fe
and
the
pennsylvania
as
proposed
will
be
in
furtherance
of
the
overall
national
transportation
policy
declared
by
the
congress
and
its
consummation
will
not
unduly
curtail
competition
in
connection
with
the
other
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
conversely
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
on
conversely
the
commission
found
--
at
the
top
of
page
32.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
the
minneapolis
proposed
policy
of
establishing
new
routes
and
connections
with
other
carriers
would
as
the
commission
found
be
extremely
harmful
to
other
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir
at
the
top
of
the
page
32.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
refers
to
the
--
to
the
description
on
the
prior
page
on
page
31
of
what
minneapolis
would
do
under
its
proposal
by
way
of
establishing
new
routes
and
interchange
points
for
the
other
carriers.
much
of
the
--
much
of
the
case
is
tried
before
the
commission
and
is
considered
by
the
commission.
it
was
reflected
in
its
report.
it
was
comparison
of
the
competitive
effects
on
the
various
competing
carriers,
under
the
one
proposal
or
the
other.
the
commission
also
found
that
under
minneapolis
proposal
an
estimated
256
jobs,
most
of
them
on
western
would
be
affected
by
the
plan.
and
as
i've
just
pointed
out,
the
commission
found
that
the
benefits
to
minneapolis
of
establishing
additional
connection
--
connections
with
more
eastern
carriers
would
result
in
harmful
diversion
of
traffic
from
other
competing
carriers.
and
turning
to
minneapolis
estimate
that
its
acquisition
of
western
would
produce
economies
of
about
$1,800,000
a
year,
the
commission
noted
that
most
of
the
savings
would
be
at
the
expense
of
western's
employees.
of
course
that's
true
in
any
of
these
combinations.
now,
the
average
in
--
in
carrier
combinations,
two-thirds
of
the
economy
is
the
saving
from
the
combination
or
in
terms
of
labor
cost.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
the
figure
in
mind.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
was
estimated
that
256
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
jobs
would
be
eliminated.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
would
be
--
it
would
sizeable.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
--
the
commission
also
noted
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
is
indeed.
the
commission
also
noted
that
the
minneapolis
proposal
was
opposed
by
the
communities
served
by
western
and
by
western's
employees
naturally,
and
above
all
by
all
of
the
shipper
witnesses
who
appeared.
and
it's
not
quite
fair
as
the
appellants
do
to
dismiss
these
shipper
witnesses
as
uninformed
persons.
they
included,
for
example,
such
persons
as
the
traffic
manager
for
the
sunkist
orange
cooperative
which
ships
thousands
of
cars
of
oranges
and
fruit
into
the
east
each
year.
such
people
--
such
people
obviously
were
competent
to
appraise
their
--
these
interests.
and
all
of
the
shipper
witnesses
including
these
professional
traffic
people
were
opposed
to
the
minneapolis
proposal.
there
all
--
they
we're
all
preferred
so
far
as
possible
separate
operation
of
western
under
its
present
policies
and
all
supported
the
santa
fe,
pennsylvania
proposal
as
the
best
way
to
continue
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
case
of
sunkist
shipper
for
--
for
example,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
railroads
are
in
competition
for
that
huge
chunk
of
--
of
high
value
traffic.
there
are
a
number
of
--
there
are
a
number
of
routes
by
which
they
can
move
across
the
mississippi
and
into
the
north
eastern
consuming
area,
but
that's
--
that's
the
problem
in
all
of
these
cases
because
as
the
commission
runs
to
it
in
every
competing
carrier
cases.
the
--
the
competing
carriers
of
--
bring
in
witnesses
and
here
every
shipper
witness
who
appeared
favored
continuation
of
western
under
its
present
policies
and
as
a
separate
carrier
organization.
now
the
commission
specifically
recognized
that
all
of
the
carriers
seeking
to
control
western
were
in
competition
with
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
states
of
minnesota
and
northern
south
dakota.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
shipper
at
all.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
very
well
--
three
states
-
minnesota,
and
north,
and
south
dakota.
now,
the
commission
specifically
took
into
account
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
nature
--
the
nature
of
that
testimony
was
primarily
that
the
thin
traffic
lines
serving
--
the
rural
dakota
areas
needed
to
be
supported
by
a
strong,
a
strengthened
eastern
end
of
the
--
of
minneapolis
line.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
--
well,
as
the
commission
found
minneapolis
is
not
in
desperate
financial
condition.
minneapolis
is
in
rather
healthy
financial
condition.
it's
a
modernized
railroad,
its
finances
are
sound,
it
has
a
small
debt,
it
has
no
debt
maturities
coming
up
for
years.
there
was
no
urgent
financial
need
of
minneapolis
to
be
met
anymore
there
was
any
urgent
need
of
--
western
to
be
met.
the
--
the
commission
dealt
with
the
misgivings
which
i'm
sure
were
sincere
and
the
states
--
states
of
minnesota
and
particularly
north
and
south
dakota
by
its
conclusion
that
there
would
be
very
little
diversion
of
traffic
as
a
result
--
the
diversion
of
traffic
from
minneapolis
as
a
result
of
the
santa
fe
pennsylvania
acquisition.
the
matter
is
specifically
discussed.
now
the
commission
specifically
recognized
the
potential
problem
relying
in
the
fact
that
every
one
of
these
applicants
more
or
less
competes
with
western.
minneapolis
is
in
direct
competition,
parallel
competition
with
the
western
half
of
western
line.
nickel
plate
is
in
direct
compet
--
parallel
competition
with
the
eastern
half
of
western
and
of
course,
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
are
in
competition
with
western
by
--
by
route
--
by
route
up
to
the
chicago,
but
under
every
--
under
each
application
there
were
competitive
problems.
after
a
detail
analysis
of
those
competitive
consequences,
they
appear
in
--
that
analysis,
it
appears
in
the
commission
report
in
the
record
of
pages
33
to
39,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
public
interest,
the
interest
or
shippers
and
competing
carriers
a
like
would
be
best
serve
by
the
continuation
of
western
as
a
separate
railroad
under
its
present
policies
and
that
this
could
be
best
be
accomplished
by
joint
control
by
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania.
now
when
arriving
at
this
conclusion,
the
commission
didn't
rely
upon
the
promises
of
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania,
that
they
would
continue
western
as
an
independent
neutral
well
maintained
carrier
even
though
were
against
their
self
interest.
that
would
be
asking
too
much.
rather,
the
commission
relied
upon
its
further
conclusion
that
such
would
be
in
the
self
interest
of
both
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania.
and
that's
the
core
of
the
commission's
conclusion
analysis
of
this
case,
its
reliance
upon
the
self-interest
of
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania.
and
some
of
this
--
and
some
of
the
factors
upon
which
the
commission
based
this
conclusion
such
a
continued
operation
of
western
was
assured
by
the
self-interest
of
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
(voice

--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
example
at
34,
the
commission
states
that
considering
the
greater
expense
of
operating
through
a
large
congested
terminal,
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
are
just
about
as
well
off
financially
when
handling
traffic
by
western
as
they
would
be
on
the
long
haul
through
chicago.
of
course,
that
means
taking
into
account,
the
--
the
earnings
they
would
get
from
50-50
ownership
in
western.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
that's
a
subsequent
development.
that's
a
--
that's
a
development
subsequent
to
the
closing
of
this
record,
but
may
i
address
myself
to
that.
that
is
a
development
which
happily
is
going
on
the
good
many
railroads.
now
what
this
$20,000,000
railroad
is?
it‘s
one
of
this
so-called
push
button
railroads,
push
button
yards
which
it
sold
--
produce
a
such
savings
to
railroads
that
on
the
average
they
pay
for
themselves
in
five
to
seven
years
and
one
railroad
after
another
throughout
the
country
is
installing
them,
new
york
central
has
two
or
three
under
construction.
southern
has
put
them
under
construction.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
the
appellants'
argument
there
is,
that
its
competing
carriers
should
cease
to
make
improvements.
certainly
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
point
of
view,
we
are
delighted
to
see
--
to
see
that's
--
that's
sort
of
a
technical
progress.
it
produces
huge
savings
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
the
shipping
public.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
there
are
other
such
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
that
--
if
that
factor
had
been
in
the
record
before
the
commission,
it
should
have
taken
into
--
into
account.
now,
i
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
surely.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now
that's
a
subsequent
development.
now
a
similar
development
in
the
general
traffic
area
new
york
central
is
doing
the
same
thing
in
elkhart,
indiana
competitively.
for
all
the
record
shows
that
might
more
or
less
offset
competition
wise.
what
santa
fe
is
doing
in
chicago?
this
is
going
out
all
over
the
country.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
under
section
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
under
section.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
in
terms
of
cost
per
ton
mile
for
example,
no
such
record
was
made
by
the
parties.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
recall
a
finding
on
those
terms.
of
course
both
the
record
and
the
commission's
report
is
--
is
in
--
is
full
of
the
fact
that
since
1930,
the
cooperation
between
santa
fe,
western,
and
pennsylvania
has
--
has
produced
an
efficient
modern
competitive
route
by
western,
mostly
in
overhead
traffic
transcontinental
traffic.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
on
pages
40
and
41
of
the
record
in
the
commission's
report,
there
are
set
forth
the
seven
conditions
which
the
condition
--
which
the
commission
attached
to
the
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
acquisition.
i
should
say
that
these
same
conditions
have
been
attached
to
a
number
of
carrier
acquisitions.
they
can
be
enforced
at
least
in
part.
for
example,
the
first
condition
is
that
under
the
control
of
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania,
western
shall
contain
and
keep
open
all
routes
and
channels
of
trade.
there
was
case
in
this
court
in
which
the
commission
was
upheld
in
enforcing
such
a
condition.
some
years
before
the
commission
had
authorized,
the
atlantic
coast
line
to
acquire
control
the
clinchfield
and
for
the
benefit
of
some
small
carriers
down
there
connecting
with
clinchfield,
the
georgia
and
florida
and
one
or
two
others,
the
commission
put
in
this
condition
and
there
came
a
day
when
the
atlantic
coast
line
published
some
reduced
tariffs,
reduced
rates
which
--
which
were
specifically
made
inapplicable
to
the
through
routes
with
georgia
and
florida
on
the
other
carriers
intended
to
be
protected
by
just
a
few
condition.
the
commission
canceled
the
rates.
the
coast
line
took
us
to
court
and
finally
the
--
this
--
the
commission's
action
in
enforcing
that
condition
was
sustained
by
this
court.
the
commission
took
into
account
that
the
santa
fe
cooperation
with
western
and
pennsylvania
had
resulted
in
western
obtaining
70%
of
its
gross
revenues
from
interchange
with
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania.
and
as
i
had
pointed
out,
the
commission
also
concluded
that
as
joint
owners
of
western
in
sharing
its
earnings,
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
would
be
up
just
about
as
well
of
financially
in
handling
traffic
by
western
as
they
would
be
on
the
longer
haul
via
congested
chicago.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
commission
referred
to
that
prior
ownership
of
western
and
found
that
western's
recent
prosperity
under
the
mcnear
management
was
due
in
large
part
to
the
opening
up
in
1927
as
mr.
mcnear
acquired
control,
of
western's
first
contact
connection
with
santa
fe
at
lomax.
though
the
commission
took
into
account
that
most
traffic
is
routed
by
shippers
and
that
the
shipper's
service
is
the
most
important
factor,
that
maintaining
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
there
are
other
variations
of
that.
now,
ship
--
shippers
determined
most
to
the
routing
of
freight,
but
they
can
do
it
in
different
ways.
they
can
leave
the
junctions
unspecified.
that
would
mean
that
the
--
the
originating
carrier
is
entitled
to
run
with
it
to
the
last
point
at
which
he
connects
with
the
second
carrier.
but
a
big
shipper
like
the
sunkist
exchange,
where
there
was
with
this
traffic
department,
they
often
specify
the
junctions,
because
they
know
enough
about
the
rate
structure
that
they
--
that
they
aren't
taking
the
risk
of
getting
into
a
rate
trap
by
specifying
the
junctions.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
course,
if
the
shipper
doesn't
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
in
maintaining
the
present
service
of
western,
it
means
that
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania,
so
the
commission
found,
will
share
in
the
revenues
of
traffic
which
otherwise
would
be
diverted
to
other
competing
carriers.
finally,
the
commission
found
that
continuation
of
western's
present
policies
of
neutrality
and
service
and
solicitation
with
interchanging
carriers
could
be
best
assured
by
having
the
ownership
divided
equally
between
its
largest
connecting
carrier
on
the
west
and
its
largest
connecting
carrier
in
the
east.
it
was
the
commission's
judgment,
“under
this
built-in
system
of
checks
and
balances,
it
is
inconceivable
for
the
santa
fe
to
permit
impairment
of
service,
or
discriminatory
solicitation
with
respect
to
eastern
connections,
or
for
pennsylvania
to
permit
western
to
do
so
with
respect
to
the
--
the
western
connections.”
for
example,
if
santa
fe
is
a
joint
owner
permits
western
to
discriminate
in
the
east
in
favor
of
pennsylvania
and
against
such
competitors
of
pennsylvania
as
nickel
plate
and
new
york
central.
nickel
plate
and
new
central
have
ways
to
retaliate
against
santa
fe
and
the
same
as
through
if
pennsylvania
should
permit
western
to
discriminate
in
favor
of
--
in
favor
santa
fe
and
against
western's
other
--
western
connections
such
as
burlington,
rock
island,
and
minneapolis.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
the
checks
on
--
because
there
is
no
check
and
balance
there.
minneapolis
is
the
sole
owner.
check
--
checks
and
balances
assumes
an
owner
at
each
into
the
line
not
in
the
middle
as
burlington
was
before
at
each
end.
now
these
railroads,
these
western
railroads
solicit
traffic
for
themselves.
they
don't
solicit
it
for
their
eastern
connections,
or
particular
eastern
connections.
they
want
friendship
for
all
the
--
their
eastern
connections.
the
same
is
true
--
the
same
is
true
for
the
eastern
railroads.
if
they
start
discriminating
in
favor
of
a
particular
western
connection
or
particular
eastern
connection,
the
case
maybe,
it
simply
invites
retaliation.
the
western
line
is
generally
play
a
game
of
neutrality
as
against
--
as
between
their
eastern
connections
and
vise
versa.
now,
we
submit
that
the
three-judge
court
correctly
held
that
these
findings
provided
a
rational
basis
for
the
commission's
order.
and
mr.
thomas
in
our
division
the
argument
will
point
out
some
of
the
evidence
supporting
those
findings.
now,
we
submit
that
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
act,
the
interstate
commerce
act,
there
was
a
true
comparative
evaluation
as
to
which
of
the
competing
applications
would
best
serve
the
public
interest.
now,
it
was
a
subtle
and
a
difficult
task.
honest
men
can
decide
these
things
under
section
5,
usually
either
way.
the
two
applications
contemplated
entirely
different
dispositions
of
the
strategic
western
property.
the
commission
was
required
(inaudible)
to
get
through
talking
about
requirements
of
findings
and
so
on,
the
commission
was
required
to
make
a
broad
judgment
a
value
judgment
based
upon
the
realities
of
carrier
competition.
it
couldn't
adopt
that
task.
it
couldn't
hide
from
the
burden
of
making
that
on
your
judgment
by
hiding
behind
a
mechanical
comparison
of
different
features
of
the
applications,
such
as
the
appellant
contends
for.
now
that
kind
of
a
mechanical
comparison,
we
realize,
maybe
quite
appropriate.
for
the
task
is
to
choose
between
two
substantially
identical
applications
for
radio,
or
t.v.
licenses.
we
don't
think
it
had
any
part
in
a
case
of
this
type.
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly
to
minneapolis
antitrust
arguments.
minneapolis
contends
that
pennsylvania,
santa
fe
could
not
sustain
their
application
without
an
affirmative
showing
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
be
transgressed
and
that
the
commission's
order
is
invalid
in
the
absence
of
--
absence
of
an
inquiry
into
whether
the
acquisition
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
findings
respecting
the
nature
and
scope
of
such
alleged
antitrust
violations,
and
findings
of
advantages
to
the
public
outweighing
to
harm
attendant
upon
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
we
will
submit
as
our
brief
on
that
point,
this
court's
decision
in
the
mclean
case
which
contains
a
careful
review
of
the
relationship
between
the
special
and
national
transportation
policy
with
respect
to
--
to
railroad
consolidations
and
the
general
antitrust
laws.
briefly,
i
resist
the
temptation
a
quote
from
that
opinion
because
if
fits
this
case
minneapolis
contentions
like
a
half.
briefly
this
court
said
that
in
authorizing
railroad
consolidations,
congress
did
not
import
the
general
policies
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
a
measure
of
their
permissibility.
now,
the
court
said
there
that
also,
that
the
commission
may
not
ignore
entirely
the
policies
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
said
the
commission
must
conceder
the
effect
in
competitors,
now
the
general
competitive
situation
of
the
industry.
and
it
must
estimate
the
scope
and
appraise
the
effects
of
the
curtailment
of
competition
of
which
will
result
from
the
proposed
consolidation.
and
we
submit
that
a
reading
of
the
commission's
report
shows
that
it
did
just
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
did
not
make
findings
in
terms
of
antitrust
considerations.
it
waved
the
competitive
consequences
as
this
court
said
in
the
mclean
case
that
it
must.
the
commission
made
no
findings
as
to
whether
without
its
approval
this
acquisition
would
involve
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
commission
isn't
empowered
to
enforce
the
sherman
act
or
to
determine
what
would
violate
it,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
mclean.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
sir.
there
were
no
such
findings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
made
this
decision
in
terms
of
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it's
qualified
by
this
court's
conclusion
in
the
mclean
case
that
in
so
doing,
the
commission
must
take
into
effect
the
competitive
consequences
upon
competing
carriers
and
upon
the
general
competitive
situation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they're
strictly
your
honor,
strictly
and
detailed
and
the
court
gave
full
venue
to
them
in
the
mclean
case,
that
the
authority
conferred
by
this
section
shall
be
exclusive
of
plenary
and
the
carrier
who
is
participating
may
carry
out
the
transaction,
freed
from
the
operation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
of
all
other
restraints,
limitations,
and
prohibitions
of
law,
federal,
state,
or
municipal
and
this
court
has
given
again
full
length
to
that
in
the
mclean
case.
so
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
your
honor
said
specifically
that
congress
did
not
import
into
its
real
consolidation
policy.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
the
policies
of
--
the
policies
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
not
quite
because
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
the
commission
must
consider
the
competing
consequences
upon
competing
carriers
upon
--
and
upon
the
general
competitive
situation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
it
did
so.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
that
finding
is
at
page
39.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
on
page
39
of
the
record.
we
are
convince
that
the
benefits
to
be
derive
from
the
operation
of
western
under
the
control
of
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania
will
be
in
furtherance
of
the
overall
national
transportation
policy
declared
by
the
congress
and
its
consummation
will
not
unduly
curtail
competition
in
connection
with
the
other
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
citing
mclean
trucking.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
that
is
the
general
conclusion.
that
in
turn
is
based
upon
pages
of
prior
discussion
as
to
the
specific
competitor
--
competitive
effects
upon
each
of
five
or
six
carriers,
rock
island,
nickel
plate,
minneapolis,
and
so
on.
that's
the
conclusion
based
upon
detailed
prior
discussion.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
on
the
findings,
no.
the
commission
did
not
explore
the
pennsylvania
motives.
it
wasn't
relying
upon
pennsylvania
motives.
it
assumed
that
pennsylvania's
motives
for
self
interest.
that
--
in
the
test
under
section
5
is
not
what
pennsylvania
wants,
it's
the
public
interest.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
and
that
--
and
--
and
there
the
--
there
the
commission
came
to
the
conclusion
it
did
only
because
of
its
further
conclusion
that
continuation
of
those
policies
was
in
the
self
interest
of
santa
fe
and
pennsylvania.
it
was
not
relying
upon
promises.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
suppose
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
it's
broadly,
of
course.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
met
in
this
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
i
mean
if
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
met
in
the
sense
but
the
commission
had
to
assume
that
all
of
pennsylvania's
motives
would
be
in
the
direction
of
self
interest
and
it
was
on
that,
that
it
was
relying.
it
wasn't
trying
to
determine
whether
--
it
was
--
pennsylvania's
motives
were
just
understood.
it
had
to
assume
that
they
weren't.
may
i
turn
briefly
to
the
con
–
minneapolis'
further
contention
that
the
santa
fe,
pennsylvania
purchased
a
western
stock
was
a
violation
of
section
10
of
the
clayton
act
which
precluded
the
commission
from
approving
the
transaction.
i
think
i
should
discuss
it
briefly
if
only
because
of
the
novelty
of
the
contention.
now
section
10
of
the
clayton
act
provides
that
no
carrier
shall
have
dealings
in
security
supplies
or
other
articles
of
commerce
with
another
cooperation
with
which
the
carrier
has
interlocking
officers
or
directors
unless
and
except
such
purchases
shall
be
made
from
or
such
dealings
shall
be
with
the
bidder
whose
bid
is
the
most
favorable
to
such
common
carrier,
the
bid
most
favorable
to
the
carrier.
now,
we
submit
that
there
was
no
violation
of
section
10
and
then
that
if
there
was
the
commission,
under
section
5
(11),
still
had
the
power
to
authorize
the
transaction.
first,
the
commission
found
that
when
santa
fe
bought
western
stock
from
the
trustees
it
did
so
without
any
commitment
to
share
it
with
pennsylvania
or
anybody
else.
secondly,
section
10,
on
its
face,
is
intended
to
give
a
railroad
protection
of
competitive
bidding.
now
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
that
there
were
four
interlocking
--
there
were
four
interlocking
directors
and
there
had
been
a
prior
aborted
sale.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
don't
think
so,
because
this
bidding
which
is
to
take
place
is
to
be
in
terms
of
the
bid
most
favorable
to
the
carrier.
in
other
words,
the
bidding
is
to
protect
the
carrier
against
--
against
being
built,
against
paying
higher
prices.
and
it's
--
it's
not
the
purpose
of
the
bidding
under
face
of
section
10
is
not
to
subject
the
carrier
to
higher
prices
by
forcing
it
into
competitive
bidding
with
competing
carriers.
it's
to
protect
the
carrier
not
to
subject
at
higher
prices.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
the
wilmington
trust
company.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
pennsylvania
has
reserved
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
pennsylvania
has
reserved
its
right
to
litigate
with
the
trustees
and
it
is
doing
so.
santa
fe
washed
the
thing
out,
simply
paid
a
higher
price
of
$135
a
share.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
an
adjustment
so
that
the
stock
will
still
in
that
being
divided
50-50
between.
other
than
that,
santa
fe
has
--
has
no
interest
in
the
litigation
and
is
not
suing
the
trustees.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
later
contracted
to
sell
half
of
it
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
to
pennsylvania
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
at
the
same
price
it
paid
of
$135?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir
in
that
section
10
of
the
clayton
act
as
we
show
in
our
brief
is
a
part
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
which
section
5
(11)
refers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
i
know,
i
don't
go
that
far.
if
it's
a
violation
of
10
and
10
is
a
criminal
statute
and
that's
administered
by
the
united
states
not
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
commission
would
have
no
authority
to
absolve
a
prior
criminal
violation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
otherwise
found
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
this
situation,
the
trustees
had,
i
think
it
was
82%
of
the
stock.
there
was
only
one
with
a
unique
commodity,
the
controlling
block
of
stock
in
western.
how
could
railroad
get
the
benefit
of
competitive
bidding?
there
was
only
one
source
of
supply.
either
they
--
either
they
could
get
it
from
the
trustees
in
that
mclean
state
or
they
couldn't
get
from
anybody.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
we
replied
that
section
10
doesn't
fit
there.
the
purpose
of
section
10
is
to
give
the
carrier
the
purpose
of
the
protection
of
the
lowest
bid
resulting
from
competitive
bidding.
what
the
appellants
do
would
turn
section
10
around
put
the
carriers
competing
against
each
other
in
competitive
bidding
to
produce
the
highest
possible
price
for
the
trustees
whereas
section
10
is
intended
to
protect
the
carriers
not
somebody
else.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
i'm
saying
that
section
10
is
not
concerned
with
--
with
protecting
the
selling
person.
section
10
is
--
is
intended
to
protect
the
selling
carrier
--
the
purchasing
carrier,
to
give
it
the
benefit
of
lowest
bid
resulting
from
competitive
bidding.
now,
the
commission
under
section
5
place
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
that's
the
way
section
10
is
phrased.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
on
page
77
of
our
brief.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
and
such
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
such
purchases
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
then
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
doesn't
--
in
the
middle
of
section
except
such
purchases
shall
be
made
from
or
such
dealing
shall
be
made
with,
the
bidder
whose
bid
is
the
most
favorable
to
such
common
carrier,
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
to
protect
the
carrier
from
being
noted,
it's
one
interlocking
relationship,
not
to
insure
higher
prices
for
the
non-carrier
persons
with
whom
--
with
whom
the
carrier
is
dealing.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
is
solely
a
carrier
a
common
carrier
protection
section.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
not
the
small
line
that's
involved
here.
it's
the
owners
of
the
small
line.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
difference
between
the
corporation
and
the
stockholder.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
particularly
sir.
the
commissions
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
commission's
roll
under
section
5
is
to
determine
whether
the
price
is
a
fair
and
reasonable
one.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
the
ultimate
test,
is
--
is
which
this
position
is
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
indeed
sir
and
in
this
case
the
commission
specifically
found
that
$135
per
share
was
a
fair
and
reasonable
price.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
rock
island
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
example
rock
island
and
nickel
plate
asked
for
inclusion
of
the
same
price.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
they
did
--
they
did
not
approach
it,
frankly.
they
did
not
approach
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
procedure
would
achieve
the
highest
price
for
the
trustees.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
did
have
a
proposal
before
the
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
--
but
of
course
the
big
question
was
who
is
to
be
allowed
to
acquire.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
minneapolis
was
going
to
pay
the
same
price.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
all
it
can
be
is
an
authorization
or
approval.
the
commission
has
no
power
to
require
--
to
require
the
trustees
to
sell
to
anybody.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
the
question
of
which
--
of
a
competing
applicant
would
under
some
form
of
competitive
bidding
pay
the
highest
price
to
the
owners
of
the
western
stock.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
--
i
don't
think
they
would.
may
i
yield
the
balance
of
our
time
to
mr.
thomas?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
suggest
that
really
is
a
secondary
point
in
our
brief.
now,
i
recognize
freely
that
to
take
that
position,
you
have
to
read
something
under
the
statute
which
isn't
--
which
isn't
clear
there.
i
was
troubled
by
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
our
basis
for
that
argument
is
that
language
which
i
called
to
your
honor's
attention
before,
the
whole
mechanism
is
hinged
in
terms
of
the
bidder
whose
bid
is
most
favorable
to
the
carrier.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
whole
thing
seems
to
be
in
terms
of
protecting
the
carrier
from
being
exploited,
not
to
protect
anybody
else
with
whom
the
carrier
is
dealing.
so
we
don't
--
in
terms
of
that
apparent
purpose,
we
don't
see
how
competitive
bidding
would
fit
the
congressional
purpose
here
without
really
just
turning
section
10
around.
to
put
the
carriers
bidding
against
each
other
resulting
in
a
higher
price
rather
than
the
carriers'
getting
the
benefit
of
lower
prices
through
competitive
bidding.
i
have
to
tell
you
also
the
legislative
history
is
rather
confusing
and
it
just
doesn't
help
on
this,
at
least
we
couldn't
get
any
help
on
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
obliterate
any
criminal
violation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
part
on?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
part
sir,
and
the
--
and
the
further
conclusion
of
the
court
--
of
the
three-judge
court.
the
three-judge
court
pointed
out,
that
the
trustees,
including
the
wilmington
trust
company,
were
not
acting
on
their
own
behalf.
the
wilmington
trust
company
was
not
acting
on
its
behalf,
it
was
acting
as
trustee,
as
fiduciary
of
an
estate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
from
which
the
three-judge
court
concluded
that
there
was
not
--
there
was
not
the
possibility
of
in
richmond,
richmond
of
the
trust
company
but
through
this
interlocking
relationship.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
the
statute
--
that
--
that
the
statute
was
directed
at.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
even
but
were
not
sir
because
--
because
we
pointed
out
that
section
10
is
a
part
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
section
5
(11)
that
the
interstate
commerce
acts
provide,
that
the
parties
to
a
transaction
authorized
by
the
commission
may
go
ahead
and
consummate
that
transaction
without
regard
to
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
77?
no,
i'm
sorry
that's
in
73,
“i
hereby
relief
from
the
operation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
of
all
restraints,
limitations,
and
prohibitions
of
law.”
now,
i
give
you
a
dramatic
illustration
of
the
contrary.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
5
(11),
this
court
sustained
the
application
of
the
sherman
act
to
force
the
southern
pacific
to
give
up
the
western
pacific,
at
least
i
think
it
would
be
western
pacific,
as
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
after
the
enactment
of
section
5
(11)
in
1920,
the
carriers
applied
under
section
5
for
authority
to
merge
or
acquire
control
and
that
--
that
the
commission
granted
that
application
and
--
and
the
court's
held
that
despite
the
prior
violation
of
the
sherman
act
sustained
in
this
court,
that
transaction
could
be
consummated
without
regard
to
the
sherman
act
under
the
19
--
under
this
section
(5)
as
enacted
in
1920.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
--
certainly
are
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
is
it
our
business
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
to
determine
what
would
be
a
violation
of
section
10
which
is
the
criminal
statute
enforced
by
the
united
states,
the
department
of
justice
in
the
court
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
justice,
so
that
maybe
--
so
that
maybe
the
commission
shouldn't
discuss
section
10
and
3
for
at
all.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
your
honors
so
said
in
the
mclean
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
yes.
look
--
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
healthy
transportation
system
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
in
the
interest
of
the
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
a
maximum,
yes.
the
commission
is
--
is
to
determine
whether
the
carrier
or
price
is
just
unreasonable,
but
the
carriers
are
not
disobeying
--
are
not
disobeying
their
assets
in
paying
excessive
prices.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
can
show
pressure
on
the
rate
structure.
