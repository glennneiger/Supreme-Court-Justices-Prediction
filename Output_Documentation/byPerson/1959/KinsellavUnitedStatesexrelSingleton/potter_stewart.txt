mr.
greene,
when
you
are
referring
to
trial
in
this
country,
you're
talking
about
a
trial
in
an
article
iii
court?
justice
potter
stewart
upon
indictment
and
trial
by
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
a
basic
problem
that
troubles
me,
i'm
so
dull
about
it
and
i
think
it's
not
even
mentioned
in
the
opinions
in
reid
against
covert
is
this.
this
particular
--
this
particular
respondent
killed
their
little
girl
together
with
her
--
her
child
--
together
with
her
husband.
now,
how
and
why
is
that
an
offense
against
the
united
states
at
all
to
--
to
require
a
trial
or
discovery
if
it's
an
offense
--
if
it's
an
offense
against
the
united
states
of
america,
it's
only
so
because
it's
an
offense
against
military
laws,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
if
these
people
had
been
tourist
in
germany
until
their
little
child
has
been
--
even
though
they
had
been
american
citizens
this
would
not
have
offended
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
but
they
were
violating
the
laws
of
germany?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
an
offense
against
the
united
states
only
because
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
military
code
of
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
or
why
would
any
article
iii
court
of
this
country
have
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
has
it
been
historically
that
military
law
has
taken
cognizance
of
this
conduct
which
constitutes
fundamentally,
non-military
criminal
offenses
such
as
murder,
rape,
and
so
on
and
so
on,
about
a
hundred
years
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
some
offenses,
no
doubt,
are
there
not
against
military
law,
very
grave
offenses
possibly
against
military
law
that
would
not
be
--
would
not
violate
the
law
of
the
--
criminal
law
of
the
host
country
at
all.
i'm
thinking
of
security
violations.
justice
potter
stewart
some
of
which
offenses
might
be
committed
by
dependents
as
well
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
such
a
thing
as
an
offense
--
as
exclusively
an
offense
under
the
laws
is
our
country
that
is
capital
if
that's
not
even
an
offense
at
all
against
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
treason
against
our
country,
i
suppose
to
deal
with.
justice
potter
stewart
espionage?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
happen
to
somebody
--
to
a
dependent
guilty
of
that
kind
of
an
offense
under
reid
against
covert?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
go
unpunished
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
existing
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
this
court
decisions
in
--
under
this
court's
decision
on
reid
against
covert
and
under
the
present
statutes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
kind
of
offense
would
go
unpunished
--
unprosecuted.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
colonel
wiener
that
this
very
distinction,
the
knowledge
of
counties
existed
in
the
military
law
for
good
many
years,
isn't
it
true
that
in
time
of
peace
in
this
country
even
a
soldier
had
to
be
tried
in
the
civil
courts
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
capital
offenses
but
not
for
noncapital
offenses
(voice
overlap)
rape
and
murder
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
what
offenses?
justice
potter
stewart
for
what
offenses?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
statute
that
this
court
was
concerned
within
lee
against
madigan?
