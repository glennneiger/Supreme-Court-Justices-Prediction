mr.
harold
h.
greene
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia
in
which
the
court
granted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
appellee
and
declared
article
2(11)
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
unconstitutional
in
so
far
as
it
applies
to
civilian
dependents
versus
accompanying
the
armed
forces
who
are
convicted
or
tried
for
noncapital
offenses.
the
appellee
was
the
wife
of
the
soldier
stationed
in
germany.
in
may
of
1957,
both
the
appellee
and
her
husband
were
accused
and
charged
under
the
uniform
code
with
unpremeditated
murder
in
violation
of
article
118(2)
of
that
code.
in
two
specifications,
it
was
alleged
that
the
appellee
and
her
husband
killed
their
one-year-old
son.
subsequently,
the
charge
was
reduced
from
unpremeditated
murder
to
manslaughter
in
violation
of
article
119
of
the
uniform
code.
and
the
appellee
--
both
the
appellee
and
her
husband
pleaded
guilty
to
that
charge.
the
appellee
did,
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
object
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
on
the
ground
that
she
was
a
civilian
and
therefore
not
subject
constitutionally
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
this
objection
was
overruled
and
pursuant
to
the
plea
of
guilty
that
both
the
appellee
and
her
husband
were
found
guilty
and
the
appellee
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
a
period
of
three
years.
the
judgment
and
the
sentence
were
approved
by
the
convening
authority
and
by
the
board
of
review
and
ultimately
by
the
court
of
military
appeals.
a
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed
in
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia
where
the
appellee
was
incarcerated
and
the
court
held,
as
i
stated,
that
article
2(11)
was
unconstitutional
as
applied.
now
this
case,
of
course
is
like
the
case
–
like
the
two
cases
before
this
court
in
covert
and
krueger
in
that
involved
the
dependents,
persons
accompanying
the
armed
forces
except
for
this
fact
that
here
a
noncapital
rather
than
the
capital
offense
is
involved.
and
the
problem
here
is
whether
this
difference,
this
distinction
should
make
for
a
difference
in
the
result.
the
problem
can
really
be
broken
down
in
two
questions
first,
where
the
capital
and
noncapital
distinction
can
be
relevant
at
all
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
and
secondly,
if
it
can
be
relevant
whether
it
should
be
decisive
to
the
--
to
the
outcome
of
the
case,
in
other
words,
whether
the
result
here
should
be
different
in
the
result
that
was
reached
in
covert.
on
the
first
issue,
it's
argued
by
the
appellee
that
jurisdiction
is
a
matter
of
fixed
content
which
cannot,
in
any
event,
be
varied
depending
on
the
gravity
of
the
offense.
well,
that
may
well
be
true
as
a
general
matter,
although
it
isn't
entirely
in
all
cases.
for
example,
the
military
for
many
years
from
1863
to
1916
had
jurisdiction
over
common
law
offenses
other
than
capital
offenses,
did
not
--
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
capital
offenses
even
the
time
of
war
until
1916.
it
certainly
is
true
in
this
situation
and
that
is
for
these
reasons.
the
problem
of
course
here
is
a
constitutional
one.
now,
the
capital
and
noncapital
distinction
has
relevance
and
has
been
held
by
the
court
to
have
relevance
in
other
types
of
constitutional
cases
and
i'm
specifically
i'm
referring
to
due
process
cases.
in
our
view,
the
problem
that
is
here
involved
is
essentially
similar
to
a
due
process
type
of
problem,
and
the
techniques
and
the
approach
of
the
due
process
determination
should
be
used
and
this
arises
essentially
out
of
the
fact
that
the
offense
was
committed
overseas
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
proper.
now,
we
recognize
that
in
re
ross
and
the
insular
cases
which
this
court
discussed
at
length
both
in
the
first
covert
opinion
and
in
the
second
covert
case,
cannot
be
read
to
put
the
proposition
that
the
constitution
cannot
in
any
event
have
any
application
abroad.
but
i
think
those
cases
do
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case,
the
practicalities
and
the
necessities
do
have
relevance
in
determining
whether
any
particular
power,
any
particular
provision
does
apply
when
the
problem
arises
outside
of
the
united
states
proper.
for
example,
in
the
ross
case
itself
it
was
deemed
relevant
that
the
--
it
was
--
it
appeared
necessary
for
the
protection
of
americans
of
counselor
courts
be
established.
i'm
not
saying
at
the
ross
case
without
more
just
because
this
was
held
to
be
true
in
the
ross
case
that
therefore
we
could
establish
counselor
courts
or
similar
type
of
courts
in
this
situation,
but
it
does
stand
for
the
proposition
and
--
as
far
as
we
can
determine
and
has
not
been
overruled,
it
does
stand
for
the
proposition
that
in
particular
circumstances,
various
factors
such
as
practicalities
and
necessities
do
have
a
bearing
on
the
scope
and
the
breadth
of
various
constitutional
provisions
and
policies.
the
same
would
be
true
of
the
insular
cases.
the
court
there
held
in
these
various
cases
that
--
that,
for
example,
jury
trials
need
not
be
provided
in
criminal
cases
in
the
philippines
or
in
hawaii
and
puerto
rico
and
so
on
because
it
was
said
that
the
traditions
and
institutions
in
those
territories
didn't
lend
themselves
to
that
type
of
procedural
device.
and
again,
while
we're
not
arguing
if
this
has
to
be
carried
over
as
such
into
these
cases,
it
does
show
that
the
approach
is
essentially
one
of
determining
each
situation
on
its
particular
facts
and
on
the
circumstances
as
they
arise.
so,
the
basic
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
from
those
decisions
is
that
--
that
practical
matters,
circumstances
of
the
era,
circumstances
of
--
of
the
--
the
power
that
can
be
exercised
properly
in
the
particular
--
in
the
particular
country
at
a
particular
time,
do
have
relevance
to
the
scope
of
--
of
constitutional
powers
and
constitutional
provisions
and
guarantees
generally
abroad.
now,
that's
true
generally
and
then
i
suppose
assuming
that
the
conditions
here
are
present
for
the
same
--
in
the
same
way
that
--
that
would
come
to
the
conclusion
would
it
be
relevant
in
this
situation
as
well.
now,
the
--
that
--
that
type
of
an
issue
as
to
whether
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
demand
and
the
circumstances
at
least
are
relevant
to
determining
the
scope
of
powers
is
best
and
can
really
only
be
determined
and
--
and
decided
by
a
due
process
type
of
approach.
on
the
one
hand,
the
interests
of
the
various
parties
have
to
be
considered,
on
the
other
hand,
the
practicalities
and
necessities
of
the
situation
and
that
type
of
an
approach,
traditionally,
the
capital,
noncapital
distinction
has
been
irrelevant
factor.
i
might
say
too
that
the
same
conclusion
can
be
reached
irrespective
really
of
ross
or
the
insular
cases
simply
on
the
--
on
the
problem
of
the
content
of
clause
14
itself,
the
clause
which
permits
congress
to
provide
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
as
was
indicated,
as
--
as
we
quote
in
our
brief
from
alexander
hamilton
from
the
federalist,
he
had
the
view
that
the
circumstances
and
necessities
are
relevant
to
the
--
to
the
determination
of
the
scope
of
this
clause
14
power.
now,
we
don't
mean
to
say
that
the
clause
14
power
can
be
expanded
at
will,
at
the
expense
as
it's
suggested
by
our
opponents
at
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments,
but
we
do
suggest
that
the
--
the
circumstances
are
appropriate
in
any
--
in
any
given
case
to
determine
how
far
the
power
extends.
for
example,
as
we
read
the
history,
the
power
does
extend
--
did
extend
in
frontier
type
situations
where
there
were
no
civil
courts.
the
power
does
extend
and
did
extend
in
war
time
for
civilians
as
--
as
some
of
the
cases
hold.
so,
it
--
it
seems
to
us
that
if
those
types
of
considerations
can
give
content
to
the
power
and
have
given
content
to
the
power,
then
in
this
situation
too,
these
--
these
same
considerations
maybe
considered
and
maybe
relevant
to
determine
what
the
content
of
the
power
is.
we
contend
of
course
that
in
a
--
in
a
–
certainly
in
the
general
way,
the
situation
we
have
here
overseas
is
analogous
to
the
types
of
situations
that
were
confronted
by
the
british
parliament
when
the
--
the
articles
of
war
1765
were
passed
when
--
when
they
were
talking
about
giving
court
martial
jurisdiction
over
persons
who
were
in
places
where
the
--
where
our
civil
judicature
as
it
is
said
in
the
--
in
the
article
is
absent.
he
--
our
the
civil
judicature
is
absent
as
the
same
way
as
it
was
in
gibraltar
or
in
annapolis
in
--
at
time
when
those
articles
were
first
enacted.
now,
assuming
that
it
is
capital,
noncapital,
distinction
can
be
relevant
across
the
problem
still
is
whether
the
--
whether
that
distinction
should
have
a
decisive
impact
on
the
case
so
as
to
cause
a
result
that's
different
from
that
was
reached
in
covert
and
we
think
that
it
does.
it
has
that
impact
and
does
have
that
significance.
in
two
respects,
one
that
might
be
called
that
has
negative
and
the
other
positive
and
negative
aspect
is
simply
the
fact
that
here,
the
very
important
consideration
that
--
that
was
so
much
discussed
in
the
covert
opinions
and
concurring
opinions,
certainly,
that
life
was
at
stake
and
that
the
--
the
death
was
irrevocable.
that
factor
is
simply
absent
here.
that
type
of
the
factor
which
many
times
in
the
past
has
led
the
court
to
make
a
sharp
distinction
between
one
type
of
process
that
may
--
maybe
that
do
appropriate
in
one
type
of
situation.
it
has
led
the
court
to
hold
that
the
same
type
of
process
need
not
be
given,
where
noncapital
cases
involve.
but
beyond
that
merely
negative
factor
of
the
absence
of
the
--
of
the
capital
nature
of
the
case,
there
is
also
a
positive
factor
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
alternatives
that
are
available
to
the
exercise
of
court
martial
jurisdiction.
briefly,
it's
our
view
that
the
only
real
alternative
to
the
exercise
of
court
martial
jurisdiction
is
also
attractive
and
palatable
and
desirable
from
the
overall
american
interest
not
only
of
the
american
government
but
also
of
this
--
of
the
persons
involved
themselves
is
a
trial
in
this
country.
and
that
i
think
was
the
rationale
in
which
the
decision
--
the
ultimate
decision
in
convert
can
be
explained.
in
other
words,
it
was
possible
to
bring
back
to
transport
the
few
persons
involved
in
capital
cases
back
to
this
country
for
a
trial.
the
--
it
warranted
and
--
and
physically
and
practically
possible,
but
i
think
it's
not
realistic
or
practical
to
expect
the
same
kind
of
approach
in
the
many
noncapital
cases
that
are
committed
at
all
times
overseas
by
the
--
almost
half
a
million
persons
who
make
up
this
contingent
that
these
cases
are
concerned
with.
for
--
for
these
minor
offenses,
it
would
simply
not
be
one
that
the
said
in
motion,
the
elaborate
apparatus
that
would
be
necessary
to
bring
about
a
trial
in
the
united
states.
for
example,
the
problem
of
witnesses
alone
would
be
a
--
a
staggering
problem.
the
--
some
of
the
witnesses
might
be
local
police
officials.
you
would
bring
them
back
to
the
united
states
and
they
might
have
to
wait
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
until
the
trial
could
be
held.
it
would
disrupt
the
operations.
they
probably
would
not
--
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
want
to,
wouldn't
feel
like
abandoning
their
duties
in
their
respective
countries
to
come
here
to
participate
in
those
trials.
other
persons
--
other
witnesses
might
be
co-conspirators
or
other
persons
who
would
be
--
might
be
reluctant
to
come
here.
now,
i
say
that
in
capital
cases,
it
would
be
warranted
to
make
the
specialized
effort
that
would
be
necessary
to
overcome
all
those
difficulties,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
kind
--
some
kind
of
an
effort
either
can
be
made
or
would
be
warranted
in
every
type
of
minor
or
--
or
noncapital
offense
that
might
be
committed
by
anyone,
anywhere
in
the
world
that
would
be
covered
by
this
article.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
in
article
iii
court,
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
alternative
that
was
suggested
basically
at
the
time
the
covert
cases
were
argued.
and
i
think
the
alternative
is
still
suggested
now
but
--
because
the
other
problems
aside
from
the
problem
of
witnesses,
there
is
a
problem
of
a
speedy
trial.
a
trial
would
not
take
place
in
a
local
community.
all
those
problems
would
be
attended
on
a
trial
in
article
iii
trial
in
this
country.
and
we
simply
think
that
wouldn't
be
warranted
to
--
to
do
that
in
the
run
of
the
mill
cases
that
occur
overseas.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it's
correct.
at
the
present
time,
that
is
certainly
true.
we
would
--
we
would
of
course
--
it
--
it
is
also
true
that
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
is
correct.
but
of
course,
congress
could
presumably
make
it
a
law
against
the
united
states
trialable
in
article
iii
court
even
though
the
offense
was
committed
overseas.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
at
the
present
time,
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
is
correct.
at
the
present
time,
that
is
--
that
is
the
only
reason
why
it
is
an
offense
against
the
united
states.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
as
i
say,
at
the
present
time,
i
think
an
article
iii
court
in
this
country
would
not
--
not
have
jurisdiction,
but
our
opponent
suggests
that
what
should
be
done
in
these
cases
is
for
congress
to
enact
a
whole
of
code
of
laws
covering
all
offenses
that
might
be
committed,
covering
these
particular
persons
in
all
country
--
all
countries
of
the
globe
and
then,
they
would
be
brought
back
here
and
they
would
be
tried
here
in
article
iii
court.
that
is
what
is
suggested
by
--
by
appellee
in
this
case
and
that
while
--
while
it's
true
that
the
power
to
do
that
is
there
but
it
seems
to
us
it's
very
impractical.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
--
to
the
treason
cases.
now
of
course
that
what
--
that's
what
--
would
have
to
be
done
here
in
the
capital
cases
of
dependents
at
least
under
the
covert
decision.
and
we
say
that
it
can
be
done
in
the
occasional
treason
case
or
the
--
the
one
or
two
murders
that
are
committed
a
year
overseas,
but
it
cannot
be
done
and
should
not
be
done
and
shouldn't
be
--
shouldn't
be
required
in
respect
to
all
of
the
many
offenses
that
might
otherwise
be
committed.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes,
in
the
place
where
the
person
is
first
brought.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes,
but
you
would
still
have
to
enact
the
substance
of
code
for
the
offenses
for
each
of
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
what
i'm
trying
to
say
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
oh
yes,
that's
quite
true.
all
i
was
trying
to
say
is
that
the
present
time,
the
federal
statutes
on
the
federal
criminal
code
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
doesn't
make
this
an
offense
or
any
of
this
other
offense
that
might
be
involved.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
your
honor,
we're
not
here
arguing
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no,
not
at
all.
the
capital
problem
really
has
not
been
any
major
problem
as
--
i
was
informed
that
in
1958,
there
wasn't
a
single
capital
case
among
the
civilian
contingent.
and
if
there
is
one
or
two,
i
suppose
that
problem
can
be
dealt
with.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
either
they
could
be
turned
over
to
the
--
to
the
foundation
for
trial
if
no
--
if
no
legislation
is
passed
or
i
suppose,
once
these
cases
have
been
decided,
a
provision
will
simply
have
to
be
made
for
the
punishment
of
capital
offenses
in
the
united
states.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
--
i
simply
don't
know
and
i
--
i
can't
tell
why
legislation
has
not
been
requested
or
enacted.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
of
course
that
would
--
that
would
be
a
fact
to
the
whole
problem
and
so
far
as
it
can
be
solved,
it
would
then
be
solved
in
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
then
--
then
it
can
be
determined
to
what
--
to
what
extent
the
problem
can
be
solved
and
what
can
be
done
rather
than
dealing
with
it
in
the
piecemeal
fashion,
but
i
simply
--
i
can't
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no.
i'm
--
i'm
simply
(voice
overlap)
i'm
speculating.
i
don't
know.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no.
i
--
i
--
well,
i
--
i
don't
know.
of
course
in
the
provo
case,
i
believe
was
the
treason
case
and
that
gave
rise
to
--
to
a
great
problems
of
venue
and
then
--
and
--
and
the
speedy
trial
was
--
was
held
ultimately
and
the
speedy
trial
was
denied.
but
i'm
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
problem
would
be
so
burdensome
in
the
capital
cases
that
it
couldn't
be
overcome.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
if
the
problem
is
burdensome
and
is
difficult
to
overcome,
and
really
it
wouldn't
be
--
it
couldn't
for
practical
purposes
be
overcome
in
the
noncapital
types
of
cases.
now
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
when
the
common
law
type
crimes
were
made
punishable
under
the
--
under
the
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
the
nato
status
of
course
an
agreement
which
apply
--
applies
only
to
the
nato
treaties
provides
for
certain
a
procedural
safeguards
with
respect
to
those
persons
of
our
visiting
force,
which
would
be
tried
in
those
courts
to
certain
minimum
guarantees.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
this
treaty
doesn't
apply
to
germany.
it
applies
only
to
the
nato
countries
as
it
is
---
and
negotiations
have
been
had
to
make
the
nato
treaty
apply
to
germany,
but
at
the
present
time,
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
germany
over
any
member
of
the
visiting
force
including
civilians.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
japan
and
the
14
or
15
nato
countries,
i
believe,
have
that
type
of
--
of
the
basic
agreement.
now,
i
would
say
this
that
probably
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no,
the
--
well,
the
policy
of
the
congress
expressed
both
in
--
in
enacting
article
2(11).
and
in
--
in
the
senate
reservation
to
the
--
to
the
ratification
of
the
nato
status
of
forces
treaty
was
that
waiver
was
where
to
be
sought
whenever
possible
and
the
senate
felt
and
the
congress
felt
that
whenever
possible,
we
should
attempt
to
get
a
waiver
of
jurisdiction
from
the
foreign
nation
so
as
to
permit
the
trial
rather
in
american
court
martial.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
congress
would
have
a
primary
jurisdiction
in
some
types
of
--
it
--
it
depends
on
the
offense
and
it
depends
on
the
--
on
the
status
of
the
person.
basically,
with
respect
to
dependents,
they
would
have
a
primary
jurisdiction
in
--
in
the
nato
countries
certainly
not
in
germany,
of
course.
in
--
with
respect
to
employees,
the
foreign
nations
would
not
have
primary
jurisdiction
if
the
offense
is
--
is
an
offense
against
an
american
citizen
or
american
property
or
the
american
base
--
the
american
government
itself,
we
would
have
primary
jurisdiction.
but
i
might
say
this,
even
in
those
cases,
where
the
foreign
nations
do
have
primary
--
primary
jurisdiction,
the
practice
is
shown
that
they
have
waived
that
jurisdiction
in
about
80%
of
the
cases.
they
have
not
exercised
but
have
permitted
the
american
court
--
courts
martial
to
be
exercised
rather
than
their
own
jurisdiction.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
only
if
--
no,
we
cannot
--
we
--
in
those
cases
where
the
host
country
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
or
primary
jurisdiction,
they
are
under
no
obligation
to
waive,
but
they
have
in
fact
waived
their
jurisdiction
in
most
of
the
cases.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
at
the
present
time,
the
only
alternative
would
have
been
to
turn
to
--
to
relinquish
our
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
permit
the
germans
to
try.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
we
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
the
treaties,
that's
true.
but
we
--
we
can
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
not
under
the
treaties
themselves
but
the
practice
has
been
at
least
--
i
know
of
at
least
one
case
which
happen
to
be
a
capital
case
but
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
unpremeditated
murder
case
in
which
the
united
states
did
not
proceed
and
the
--
the
woman
was
simply
turned
loose
and
she
was
tried
in
the
german
courts
subsequently.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
it's
--
it's
a
little
hard
to
say
whether
she
was
actually
turned
over.
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
german
police
was
right
there
when
she
was
released
from
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
correct
because
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
no
case
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
those
--
the
treaties
provide
that
the
host
country
--
that
the
--
that
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
exists
only
where
the
offense
is
an
offense
both
under
the
law
of
the
host
country
and
of
the
--
of
the
ascending
state,
where
the
offense
is
in
--
is
an
offense
exclusively
under
the
laws
of
the
--
of
the
host
country,
then
only
the
host
country
has
jurisdiction
but
it's
exclusively
an
offense
under
the
--
under
the
laws
of
descending
state,
and
that
state
would
have
jurisdiction
in
all
cases.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
i
--
i
suppose
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
espionage
might
be
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
espionage,
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
i
--
i
don't
suppose
anything
would
happen.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it's
not
known.
the
point
is
that
--
that
of
course
the
statutes
could
be
passed
to
provide
--
to
take
care
of
that
situation,
but
at
the
present
time,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
nothing
is
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
--
under
existing
law,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
under
the
decisions
and
on
the
statute
as
presently
--
as
they
presently
stand
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
correct.
i
--
i
will
reserve
if
i
have
any
time
left?
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
i
think
the
--
the
consequence
is
that
the
necessities
and
the
practicalities
have
an
impact
on
the
scope
of
the
power.
we're
not
attempting
to
extend
--
extend
the
power
but
the
--
the
necessities.
i
don't
know
if
the
consequences
--
evil
consequences
is
the
--
there's
a
term
i
would
use
--
they
are
trying
to
make
an
interim
argument.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
but
consequences,
practicalities,
circumstances
do
have
and
have
traditionally
had
an
impact
on
the
scope
of
the
power
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
government
--
of
land
and
naval
forces
and
they
have
also
had
an
impact
on
the
power
of
the
--
on
the
--
on
the
scope
of
provisions
of
the
constitution
outside
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
we
have
the
power,
yes.
basic
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
isn't
--
that
isn't
the
argument
but
the
same
--
the
same
considerations
which
led
in
history
to
the
--
to
the
scope
of
the
power,
in
those
situations,
those
similar
types
of
considerations
should
--
should
lead
to
the
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
power
in
this
situation.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
we're
not
saying
that
we
have
--
that
--
that
the
historical
analysis
shows
that
at
that
time,
there
were
--
there
was
precisely
the
same
situation
where
we
had
hundreds
of
thousands
of
--
of
american
civilians
overseas.
but
what
we
are
trying
to
show
is
that
in
the
historical
perspective,
similar
situations
or
--
or
situations
of
--
of
the
same
kind,
of
the
same
quality
have
given
rise
to
an
interpretation.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
we
--
we
have
--
we
have
a
paper
--
