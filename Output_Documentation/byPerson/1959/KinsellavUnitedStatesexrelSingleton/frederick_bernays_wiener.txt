mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
court
please,
having
argued
the
covert
case
twice,
i
would
prefer
not
to
have
to
reargue
its
basic
doctrinal
considerations
on
other
time
within
the
confines
of
the
summary
calendar.
and
so,
i
will
address
myself
simply
to
the
narrow
question
of
whether
this
case
should
be
decided
differently
because
mrs.
dial
was
charged
with
a
noncapital
offense.
does
it
make
any
difference?
well,
the
board
of
review
in
this
case,
page
22
of
the
record,
the
board
of
review
composed
of
three
army
officers
gave
this
answer,
“we
conclude
that
the
necessity
for
military
jurisdiction
over
dependents
charged
with
noncapital
offenses
is
sufficient
to
overcome
the
requirements
of
article
iii
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.”
well,
that's
a
very
simple
method
of
amending
the
constitution
by
the
sword,
but
i
will
give
this
gentleman
a
credit
for
being
forthright,
for
being
candid,
for
not
shading
the
facts
and
for
not
omitting
anything.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
it
will
prove
to
be
a
very
dull
sword.
let
us
--
let
us
look
for
a
minute
on
this
solid
basis
of
history
on
which
the
government
relies
as
infusing
into
constitutional
interpretation,
a
well-established
practice
of
trying
civilian
dependents.
now,
from
1778
in
the
snows
at
valley
forge
during
the
revolution
until
1950
in
tokyo,
only
two
women
were
punished
by
american
--
by
the
american
military,
neither
of
them
dependents.
one
polly
tommy,
a
soldier
slut
flogged
without
trial
in
1795
and
lydia
connor,
who
sold
whiskey
to
soldiers,
drummed
out
of
the
camp
at
detroit
in
a
place
where
the
civil
courts
were
functioning
and
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
neither
were
dependents,
and
that
is
supposed
to
be
if
the
court
please
a
solid
basis
of
history.
now,
it
is
said
there
is
no
acceptable
or
practical
alternative
to
deal
with
dependents
charged
with
noncapital
offenses.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
article
7
of
the
nato
agreement
specifically
concedes
primary
jurisdiction
to
the
foreign
country,
the
host
country,
over
all
offenses
committed
by
dependents,
primary
jurisdiction.
now,
there
is
therefore
a
solid,
practical,
and
acceptable
alternative
arrived
at
by
solemn
international
agreement.
what
about
berlin
or
mrs.
cheaps
also
charged
originally
with
unpremeditated
murder
as
was
mrs.
dial?
she
brought
the
habeas
--
habeas
corpus
here
and
she
was
turned
over
to
the
germans.
and
i
think
that
the
new
german
agreement
which
we
mentioned
will
make
the
nato
arrangement.
now,
on
the
impact
of
article
vii
of
nato,
a
noncapital
crime
is
committed
by
dependents.
your
honors
will
not
be
confused
by
any
discussion
in
the
government's
brief
because
they
don't
mention
it
in
their
brief
at
chief
and
they
don't
deny
it
in
their
reply.
let
me
address
myself
to
this
capital,
noncapital
distinction.
it's
our
position
that
with
one
narrow
war
time
objection,
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
great
length
in
just
a
minute.
with
one
narrow
war
time
exception,
military
jurisdiction
rest
upon
military
stages.
now,
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
decisions
here
that
when
someone
becomes
a
member
of
an
armed
force,
he
assumes
new
rights,
he
assumes
new
obligations,
new
liabilities,
obligations
and
liabilities,
so
comprehensive
in
their
totality
as
to
constitute
a
state.
now,
that
must
mean
something
and
only
about
10
years
ago,
this
court
had
occasion
to
refer
to
the
vast
gulf
between
the
civil
and
the
military
jurisdiction
and
it
is
a
vast
gulf
because
each
rests
on
a
separate
head
of
power,
one
on
article
iii,
the
other
on
clause
14.
and
i
say
that
that
isn't
a
due
process
question
at
all.
due
process
considerations
are
eminently
proper,
where
the
question
concerns
the
exercise,
the
mode
of
exercise
of
an
admitted
power.
but
due
process
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
whether
the
power
exists
at
all.
and
we
are
speaking
now
of
constitutional
power
and
not
of
legislative
judgment
whether
or
not
particular
capital
offenses
should
be
triable
by
a
court
martial.
now,
what
is
the
exception
to
the
rule
of
states?
it
is
the
war
time
exception
of
jurisdiction
over
persons
in
the
field.
that
is
a
war
time
jurisdiction.
it
rests
on
the
war
power
and
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
peace
and
war
in
this
connection.
in
time
of
field
in
war
--
in
war,
in
time
of
field
is
where
military
operations
are
in
progress.
war
may
be
a
declared
war.
it
may
be
an
actual,
undeclared
war
such
as
the
hostilities
with
the
indians
or
the
hostilities
in
korea.
as
long
as
there
is
shooting
it's
in
the
field,
and
war
is
a
fact
and
not
a
legal
condition.
now,
the
very
words
of
the
old
camp-follower
article,
can
in
the
field
where
words
that
imply
a
condition
of
hostilities.
as
the
judge
advocate
general
said,
strictly
speaking,
“there's
no
such
thing
as
a
camp-follower
in
time
of
peace
because
if
it's
peaceful,
you
don't
have
a
camp.”
and
it
is
not
a
basis
for
overseas
military
jurisdiction
in
time
of
peace
that
there
happen
to
be
no
domestic
civilian
courts
around.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
do
not,
i'm
not
--
i
--
it's
a
question
of
status
by
both
civilians
as
the
government
said
in
1957
in
their
brief
on
re-argument
for
purposes
of
court
martial
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
valid
distinction
between
civilians
employed
by
the
armed
forces
and
civilian
dependents.
the
only
difference
is
the
difference
of
degree
as
to
connection
--
functional
connection
with
the
service
and
there's
a
difference
that
there
are
more
trials
of
accompanying
civilians
who
aren't
dependents.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
we
are
in
agreement
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
that
the
government
on
the
history
splits
not
only
for
me
but
also
from
the
history.
now,
let
us
go
--
let
us
go
for
a
minute
on
the
"in
the
field”
jurisdiction.
the
government
has
quoted
a
passage
--
rather
lengthy
passage
from
samuel,
historical
account
of
the
law
of
military.
that
was
quoted
two
years
ago,
it
is
cited
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
on
the
footnote
in
your
honor's
opinion.
now,
what
it
isn't
quoted
is
the
introductory
paragraph
from
691
which
says
this.
“the
second
description
of
persons
to
which
the
article
refers,
namely
settlers
and
retainers
of
the
camp
and
persons
serving
with
the
king's
armies
in
the
field,
though
they
should
not
be
enlisted
soldiers,
are
subject
to
military
orders
not
by
the
letter
of
the
mutiny
act
but
by
the
usage
and
customs
of
war.”
in
other
words,
it
is
in
exercise
of
the
war
power.
now,
i
brushed
off
when
i
dealt
with
the
samuel
quotation,
i
brushed
that
off,
“oh
that's
in
the
field”
and
i
went
on
to
digging
into
our
own
history.
but
thanks
to
mr.
kehoe
who
represents
the
petitioner
in
1958
and
it
wasn't
prepared
to
brush
the
matter
off,
he
looked
in
to
samuel.
he
got
the
book
and
he
finds
that
after
the
section
quoted
by
the
government,
there
are
three
instances
of
trials,
some
brutal
punishments,
one
of
a
thousand
lashes,
all
of
these
three
instances
from
the
peninsular
war
in
spain
in
the
british
army.
and
then,
this
paragraph
on
page
697,
this
article
so
far
as
it
respects
settlers
and
retainers
and
persons
serving
the
armies
and
actual
service
and
in
the
field
does
not
attach
to
the
same
persons
in
camp
toemans
or
in
barracks
at
home
or
in
similar
establishments
which
are
of
a
permanent
and
domestic
nature
abroad
where
the
ordinary
laws
have
their
force
and
are
administered
through
the
medium
of
the
civil
courts.
in
other
words,
even
in
the
british
service,
this
jurisdiction
wouldn't
be
exercised
where
there
was
any
kind
of
a
civil
court
around.
and
in
all
of
these
three
instances
--
the
four
cases
here,
there
were
foreign
civil
courts
functioning.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
no,
since
january
1957,
the
british
have
expanded
their
jurisdiction
but
they
don't
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
can't
say
whether
the
debates
do
but
it's
perfectly
fine
if
you
examine
the
text
of
the
army
act
1955
with
the
text
of
the
army
act
1951,
that
it
was
a
wider
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
reason
given
was
that
they
were
giving
up
the
consular
courts.
but
of
course,
the
british
don't
have
clause
14
to
contend
with.
they
would
have
decided
reid
v.
covert
differently.
they
would
have
decided
the
toth
case
differently
and
they
would
have
decided
the
hirschberg
case
differently.
they
don't
have
this
problem
at
all
but
they
did
say
way
back
that
if
there
is
any
kind
of
civil
court
functioning,
this
war
time
jurisdiction
won't
be
exercised.
now,
i
think
if
your
--
if,
your
honors
look
at
the
definitions
of
“in
the
field”,
the
opinions
of
the
judge
advocate
general,
and
the
attorney
general
that
stressed
the
limits
of
military
jurisdiction,
your
honors
will
find
that
this
is
something
sought
to
be
brushed
aside
by
the
government
as
though
it
were
a
personal
aberration
of
colonel
wilkins
and
yet,
these
distinctions
appear
in
four
published
editions
of
the
digest
of
opinions
of
the
judge
advocate
general,
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
case
to
apply
the
doctrine
which
is
expressed
in
opinions
of
this
court
that
the
opinions
of
the
judge
advocate
general
on
questions
of
military
law
are
entitled
to
some
respect.
and
the
attorney
general
also
held
that
this
jurisdiction
could
only
be
exercised
in
time
of
war
in
the
field.
and
in
that
connection,
i
must
confess
to
an
error
in
my
--
in
the
singleton
brief,
i
accredited
to
attorney
general
devens
the
opinion
in
14
of
22
which
defines
“in
the
field”.
that
was
attorney
general
williams.
attorney
general
devens
wrote
the
opinions
in
16
up,
which
says,
“you
can't
try
civilians
except
in
time
of
war
or
in
the
field.”
now,
except
for
this
settled
exception
which
rests
on
the
war
power,
i
think
it's
plain
from
the
cases
and
the
discussions
that
the
camp,
the
military
jurisdiction
without
military
states
and
i
will
now
proceed
to
set
forth
additional
grounds
where
the
capital,
noncapital
distinction
is
untenable.
first,
you
cannot
get
it
out
of
the
constitution.
the
only
place
where
the
constitution
mentions
capital
offenses
is
in
the
fifth
amendment.
and
there,
the
grouping
is
not
capital
versus
noncapital,
but
capital
and
other
infamous
crimes
on
the
one
hand
and
all
others
on
the
other.
these
--
all
of
these
cases
would
be
infamous
in
the
constitutional
sense
had
they
been
tried
in
the
civil
courts
and
second,
even
that
distinction
by
--
by
the
terms
--
by
the
next
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
applicable
to
military
cases.
second,
you
cannot
get
the
capital,
noncapital
distinction
out
of
the
--
out
of
clause
14.
we're
dealing
with
four
words
land
and
naval
forces.
what
is
the
content
of
those
four
words?
now,
i
submit
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
--
even
the
most
refined
constitutional
exegesis
to
say
that
land
and
naval
forces
plainly
excludes
women
charged
with
premeditated
murder
but
equally,
plainly
includes
them
when
they
are
charged
with
unpremeditated
murder.
there's
no
difference
--
there's
no
distinction
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
you
can
only
get
it
from
land
and
naval
forces
plus
clause
18.
and
i
say
that
both
are
amended
by
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
you
don't
throw
the
three
into
the
pot
and
jumble
them
in
a
way
interest.
the
very
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
to
preclude
precisely
the
kind
of
expansible
meaning
in
a
prohibited
zone.
now,
the
--
there's
a
--there's
a
vast
difference
between
what
hamilton
said
would
be
necessary
and
the
proper
clause,
the
sweeping
clause
as
they
called
it
in
those
days,
there's
a
vast
difference
between
what
he
said
of
the
sweeping
clause
in
1787
when
he
was
writing
the
federalist
and
what
he
put
in
his
memorandum
on
the
bank
in
1790,
which
became
the
basis
from
mcculloch
against
maryland.
and
the
fact
--
the
historical
fact
is
that
people
weren't
willing
to
trust
this
new
government
unless
some
boundary
were
drawn.
now,
hamilton
in
number
83
of
the
federalist
is
all
what
jury
trial
is
left
unimpaired.
they
prefer
to
have
an
amendment.
and
therefore,
i
say
that
to
--
to
suggest
that
the
scope
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
be
less
by
anything
in
the
original
instrument
is
to
do
violence
to
the
very
notion
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
to
the
very
thing
which
the
bill
of
rights
was
to
prevent
namely,
success
for
the
argument
that
land
and
naval
forces
is
an
expansible
concept
which
sweeps
into
its
small
civilians.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
i
--
i
say
you
can
--
the
resort
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
but
both
are
amended
by
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
if
it
is
a
question
of
federal
power,
i
an
as
staunch
a
hamiltonian
as
you
find
in
any
courtroom,
but
if
it's
a
question
of
what
are
the
limitations,
those
limitations
are
fixed
by
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
power
can't
go
beyond
that.
now,
if
they
want
to
charter
a
bank,
fine.
if
you
want
to
punish
somebody
for
stealing
from
a
national
bank,
fine.
but
you
can't
cut
off
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
i've
got
--
as
i
say,
limited
in
my
time.
i've
discussed
that
in
the
brief
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
weighing
interest
because
the
sixth
amendment
says,
“thou
shalt
not.”
now,
another
capital,
noncapital
distinction
historically,
well,
historically,
when
1787
most
--
many,
many
military
offenses
were
capital
that
the
--
the
most
important
ones
were
capital
and
the
only
noncapital,
capital
distinction
that
you'll
find
is
on
records
of
courts
of
inquiry
and
depositions.
you
couldn't
use
those
in
capital
cases.
under
the
older
jurisdictional
test
of
the
scope
of
--
of
the
review
of
judgments
of
conviction
by
court
martial,
you
look
to
was
the
court
properly
appointed,
did
it
have
jurisdiction
of
the
person,
did
it
have
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
did
it
exceed
the
permissible
sentence.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
still
law
today.
but
the
capital,
noncapital
distinction
would
make
jurisdiction
of
the
person
depend
on
subject
matter.
and
finally,
it
is
untenable
in
the
context
of
military
law.
the
first
place,
reid
v.
covert
when
it
reached
the
civil
courts
was
a
noncapital
case.
it
was
a
noncapital
case
when
she
petitioned
for
habeas
corpus
because
she
was
to
be
held
for
rehearing
which
couldn't
have
adjudged
the
capital
sense
and
that's
why
the
prosecution
is
going
to
use
the
deposition.
in
the
second
place,
article
118,
the
homicide
article
has
four
branches
of
homicide
one,
unpremeditated
murder
--
premeditated
two,
unpremeditated;
three,
reckless
murder,
the
one
disregard
and
fourth,
felony
murder.
well
now,
how
can
we
say
that
you
can
try
for
article
i
--
you
can't
for
clauses
1
and
4
but
you
can
for
2
and
3?
it's
even
more
confusing.
among
the
offenses
which
constitute
felony
murder,
this
is
118(4)
is
someone
engaged
in
the
perpetration
or
attempted
perpetration
of
burglary
and
four
other
offenses.
now,
burglary
is
denounced
by
article
129
of
the
code,
housebreaking,
which
doesn't
figure
in
felony
murder,
is
denounced
by
130.
the
manual
construing
and
explaining
the
burglary
article
says
that
a
tent
cannot
be
the
subject
of
burglary,
but
that
out
houses
in
an
inhabitant
area
can
be.
in
other
words,
if
you
are
attempting
to
commit
--
enter
--
if
you
kill
a
person
who
is
sleeping
in
a
tent
while
you're
burglarizing
the
tent
or
you
want
to
steal
something
from
it,
it
is
a
noncapital
offense
but
it
is
–
and
it's
a
capital
offense.
now,
i
say
it's
not
only
ridiculous
to
make
the
very
constitutional
power
to
try
at
all
depend
on
this
kind
of
distinction.
it's
revolving.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there
was
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
the
distinction
--
the
distinction
was
different,
your
honor.
the
distinction
was
that
until
1951,
in
time
of
peace,
the
soldier
should
be
turned
over
to
the
civil
authorities
on
request
but
it
didn't
have
to
be
in
time
of
war.
also,
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
what's
that?
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
any
offenses,
any
civil
offenses.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
in
lee
against
madigan,
aw-92
of
1920
or
1948,
which
said,
“nobody
shall
be
tried
for
rape
or
murder
committed
within
the
states
of
the
union
in
time
of
peace.”
i
have
phrased
in
the
brief
the
development
of
the
extension
of
military
jurisdiction
for
military
persons
in
respect
of
civil
offenses.
there
were
certain
offenses
in
time
of
war
in
1863.
the
civil
felonies
were
not
specifically
made
punishable
in
time
of
peace
until
1916.
and
in
the
--
in
an
ex
parte
mason,
105
u.s,
the
trial
of
the
--
by
court
martial
of
the
soldier
who
shot
at
guiteau,
president
garfield's
assassin,
he
was
charged
under
the
general
article
as
convict
attending
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
in
military
discipline.
in
the
grafton
case
in
the
206
u.s.,
homicide
by
assassin,
he
was
tried
by
the
court
martial
under
the
general
article
because
manslaughter
was
not
specifically
an
offense
in
time
of
peace.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
military
jurisdiction
in
those
instances
is
a
matter
of
legislative
judgment.
there's
no
question
of
the
power
of
congress
to
make
punishable
by
court
martial
all
capital
offenses
committed
by
persons
in
uniform,
although
it's
never
yet
may
imprison
punishable
under
the
articles
of
war.
but
what
we're
dealing
here
--
with
here
is
constitutional
power
and
i
say
when
you
go
into
the
context
of
military
law,
you
cannot
find
that
capital,
noncapital
distinction
as
a
question
of,
“can
we
try
this
person
at
all?”
and
incidentally,
it's
interesting
and
perhaps
amusing
that
the
government's
position
on
the
capital,
noncapital
distinction
is
very
different
in
this
case
than
it
is
in
the
grisham
case.
now,
here
is
a
dependent
woman
charged
of
a
noncapital
case
and
the
government
says,
“oh,
this
is
a
tremendous
distinction.”
and
then,
we
have
grisham
who
is
a
civilian
employee
charged
with
a
capital
offense
and
the
government
says,
“oh
well,
it's
no
--
no
distinction
at
all.
the
same
business,
he's
a
civilian
employee
and
not
a
dependent
and
therefore
it's
not
like
covert.”
but
at
any
rate,
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
when
you
are
dealing
here
with
the
narrow
question
of
civilian
dependents,
i
don't
think
you
will
find
any
basis
in
history
or
practice
for
their
trial
by
court
martial
in
time
of
peace,
after
all,
two
incidents,
two
incidents
in
a
172
years
and
both
of
them
in
manuscript,
one
in
the
archives
and
the
other
at
the
west
point.
now,
as
to
the
practical
necessities,
i've
mentioned
article
vii,
i've
mentioned
the
fact
that
they
turned
this
mischief
charged
with
the
same
offense
over
to
the
germans.
i
might
say
that
they
have
acquiesced
and
that
the
government
acquiesced
in
the
number
of
earlier
cases
holding
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
and
i
think
i
will
mention
the
girard
case.
in
the
girard
case,
the
government
came
here
and
obtained
a
decision
that
it
had
power
to
turn
girard
over
to
the
japanese.
now,
of
course
it
did,
no
question
about
it.
well
now,
if
it
was
a
--
a
matter
of
national
honor
to
turn
girard
over
to
the
japanese,
why
couldn't
these
four
people
have
been
tried
by
the
local
court?
why
couldn't
guagliardo
have
been
tried
by
the
moroccan
court?
he
was
in
a
moroccan
jail
for
sometime.
why
couldn't
mrs.
dial
have
been
tried
by
a
german
court
just
as
well
as
mrs.
cheaps?
why
couldn't
wilson
in
the
next
case
as
--
which
i'll
come
to
--
been
turned
over
to
the
germans.
and
as
for
grisham,
he
killed
his
--
he
killed
his
wife
on
french
soil,
he
is
the
self-made
widower.
he
killed
his
wife
on
french
soil,
he
was
held
in
the
custody
of
the
french
police
for
two
weeks.
why
wasn't
it
an
acceptable
alternative
to
turn
grisham
over
to
the
french
when
his
only
connection
with
the
army
was
that
he
was
a
civilian
employee
from
the
national
--
from
the
nashville
engineer
district
to
his
on
six
months
temporary
duty
at
orleans,
france.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
we
have
a
lot
of
the
--
i
think
the
government's
prize
exhibit
is
saudi
arabia.
how
would
you
like
to
have
your
wife
tried
in
a
saudi
arabian
court
and
have
her
hand
cut
off?
this
makes
quite
an
impression
on
district
judges
i
may
say.
well
we
have
looked
at
all
the
--
ramco
civilians
we've
got
in
--
in
saudi
arabia.
they
are
not
subject
to
trial
by
court
martial.
and
--
and
as
mr.
shakett
pointed
out,
we
have
given
up
our
consular
jurisdiction
in
morocco
because
we
felt
that
it
was
appropriate
to
do
so.
and
that
was
the
last
outpost
of
consular
jurisdiction.
in
other
words,
we
proceed
on
the
basis
that
all
of
these
people
are
civilized.
we
held
on
the
extra
territoriality
in
china
for
a
long
time
saying
we
can't
trust
the
chinese
courts.
we
gave
it
up
in
1943.
we've
given
it
up
everywhere
so
that
i
would
say
that
as
long
as
we
permit
american
civilians
to
travel
to
those
countries
on
american
passports
where
they
will
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
local
courts,
we
can't
say
that
it
is
an
unacceptable
alternative
to
turn
over
particular
classes.
so,
the
conclusion
i
arrive
at
is
that
reid
v.
covert
governs
this
case
that
the
district
judge
was
right
in
so
holding
and
that
his
judgment
freeing
mrs.
dial
from
custody
should
be
affirmed.
