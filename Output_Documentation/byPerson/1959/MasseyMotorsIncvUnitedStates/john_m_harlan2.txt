justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
rule
that
you're
advocating
here
is
limited
to
automobiles
or
is
it
one
of
general
application?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
converse
of
that
is
what
makes
the
government
unhappy
that
you
would
like
to
have
this
carry
to
ordinary
income
tax
rate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
talking
about
the
end
result
as
between
the
two
positions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
wouldn't
have
such
extreme
economic
differences
as
it
does
under
the
present?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
assuming
the
model
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
it,
applied,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
dispute
between
you
and
the
taxpayer
as
to
whether
the
right
model
was
used?
in
other
words,
this
four-year
of
useful
life
that's
used
by
the
taxpayer
is
the
proper
criteria?
is
there
--
you
contend
that
it
should
have
been
five
years
independently
as
the
argument
you're
making?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
model
is
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
it's
--
if
it's
applicable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
case
--
this
case
does
not
involve
--
your
case
as
i
understand
it
does
not
involve
the
1954
code,
the
hertz'
case
does,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
go
back
to
the
question
that
chief
justice
put
to
you?
have
you
got
any
litigated
case
either
in
the
tax
court
or
in
district
court
where
the
government
has
taken
the
position,
it's
taking
in
these
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
in
terms
of
your
1942
--
you
schedule
that
for
your
1942
regulation.
the
question
i
thought
he
asked
was
you
could
point
to
any
case
or
litigated
case
where
the
government
has
taken
this
position
other
than
these
three
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan

you'd
