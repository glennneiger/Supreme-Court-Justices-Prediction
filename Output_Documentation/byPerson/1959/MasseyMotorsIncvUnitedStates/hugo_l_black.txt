justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
claim
that
some
regulation
authorizes
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
how
it
works
out
practically
because
i
don't
quite
understand,
they
claim
an
arbitrary
right
to
take
off
on
four-year
basis.
you
say
they
don't
have
that.
so
the
dispute
comes
up
as
the
dispute
have
to
come
up
between
each
individual
taxpayer
and
the
government
at
the
time
they
make
their
return,
are
they
required
to
show
that
they
do
not
come
within
the
model
or
so-called
or
does
the
examiner
look
into
it
after
they
file
their
returns?
how
do
they
come
to
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
the
duty
is
on
him
to
make
a
report
that
he
is
different
as
(inaudible)
doesn't
come
within
the
category
of
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
doesn't
want
to
change
it?
he
is
satisfied
with
it.
is
--
is
it
his
duty
to
make
a
report
if
he
had
reason
to
suspect
that
he
is
getting
more
than
he
should
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
takes
it
--
suppose
he
takes
it
according
to
this
form,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
--
i'm
thinking
of
the
return
i
started
few
days
ago
[laughter]
on
a
car
--
on
a
car
that
the
--
they
fixed
the
value
for
you
that
--
where
you
make
a
tax
return
and
i
assume
that
probably
although
that
the
government
and
you
don't
change
it,
they
have
a
standard
value,
you're
claiming
here
that
while
you
do
give
them
tentative
standard
burden,
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
that
advantage
if
in
fact
it
gives
them
more
than
they
should
get
under
the
general
idea
of
depreciation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
property
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
that
--
why
does
that
apply
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
actual
wear
and
tear
of
the
building
from
year
to
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
still
think
as
you
have
more
(inaudible)
denial
of
that
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
can't
--
i
--
i
still
can't
understand
why
natural
thing
wouldn't
do
that
you
take
a
depreciation
on
the
building
according
to
effects
of
life
without
regard
to
the
length
of
interest
you
have
in
the
building?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
(inaudible)
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
evidently
misunderstood
from
--
up
to
this
time
what
the
difference
is
between
them.
i
feel
that
you
wanted
an
arbitrary
amount
covering
a
certain
arbitrary
period
whether
depreciated
that
much
or
not
and
the
government
was
insisting
that
that
was
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
evidently
do
not
fully
understand
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
may
i
ask
you
one
question.
let's
suppose
that
you
are
importunate
enough
in
our
business
to
be
able
to
get
less
wear
and
tear
each
year
then
somebody
else,
is
it
your
insistence
that
even
though
your
wear
and
tear
is
less
each
year,
you
still
take
the
full
amount
that
you
would
get
if
you
were
the
normal
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
all
those
words
about
use,
useful
life
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
understood
was,
i
guess
i'm
still
don't
understand.
i
understood
he
was
claiming
--
they
were
claiming
that
what
you
insist
on
is
by
reason
of
a
four-year
formula
or
whatever
it
is,
that
you're
entitled
to
get
a
greater
amount
of
depreciation
per
year
than
you
actually
suffer.
you're
doing
it
on
the
basis
of
what
somebody
else
doesn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
take
--
do
you
take
more
under
the
formula
you
have
than
you
actually
suffer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
--
you
do
not
attempt
than
just
to
follow
the
rule
that
they've
said
is
the
normal
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
you're
entitled
to
and
--
i
keep
asking
you
this
because
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
get
more
what
you're
entitled
to
would
you
not
if
you
are
actually
charging
on
more
depreciation
than
you
suffer
in
a
year.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
you're
not
doing
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
--
then
you
are
insisting
that
the
rule
has
to
be
followed
whether
you
actually
suffer
that
depreciation
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
you
suffered
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
you
actually
suffered
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
tax
court
ever
decided
it
differently
to
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
both
of
them
in
denied
kinship
with
your
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
emphasize
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
like
to
bother
you,
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
construe
that
to
mean
in
line
with
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
like
to
view
that
in
your
own
words.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
we
like
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
--
the
length
of
time
they
can
be
economically
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
that
--
well,
if
the
contentions
of
the
others
are
right,
do
you
think
this
--
the
contention
of
this
one
is
right
or
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
except
the
argument
as
to
the
practice
and
so
forth,
for
the
other
two,
how
should
this
case
be
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
the
argument
to
be,
i
may
--
i
maybe
wrong
(inaudible)
that
the
practice
which
they're
claiming
justice
had
existed
for
so
long.
it
was
so
well
settled.
it
was
the
same
as
(inaudible)
and
therefore,
you
could
no
more
write
the
regulation
that
you
have
and
you
could
have
in
congress,
written
their
practice
into
its
statute
expressly.
is
that
--
was
that
their
argument?
i
thought
that
was
their
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
r.j.
reynolds
case
in
that
connection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
it
--
in
fact,
has
the
effect
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
you
couldn't
change
her
by
this
new
regulation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
didn't
think
that
to
be
wrong,
it
might've
been.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
then
should
have
decided
in
their
favor
on
the
retroactive
point,
one
wouldn't
have
to
reach
(inaudible)
