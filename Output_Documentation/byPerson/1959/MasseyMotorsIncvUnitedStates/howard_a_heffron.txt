mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
two
following
cases
raise
common
problems
of
construction
under
the
internal
revenue
codes
of
1939
and
1954.
the
questions
relate
to
the
proper
computation
of
the
deduction
allowed
for
depreciation
in
computation
of
the
income
tax.
this
case,
evans,
comes
to
this
court
upon
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
which
follows
it,
the
hertz
case
comes
to
this
court
from
the
third
circuit
and
the
case
which
follows
hertz,
the
massey
motor
case
from
here
from
the
fifth
circuit.
both
the
third
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
reached
results
contrary
to
that
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
evans
case;
that
is
in
support
of
the
government's
position.
the
question
which
is
common
to
all
three
cases
is
one
which
concerns
the
proper
method
of
computation
of
the
depreciation
deduction
permitted
under
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
since
the
depreciation
is
no
more
than
in
means
of
describing
the
proportionate
proportion
of
the
cost
of
an
asset
which
ought
to
be
allowed
as
a
deduction
in
computing
income
for
any
given
period.
we
are
here
concerned
with
the
proper
method
of
allocating
that
cost
to
different
taxable
periods.
if
the
asset
only
lasted
for
the
one
year
period
which
is
covered
by
an
income
tax
return,
we
would
have
no
problem.
the
cost
of
that
asset
would
be
deducted
in
full
if
it
were
consumed
during
that
period.
the
problem
arises
because
of
the
nature
of
the
tangible
assets
which
are
the
subject
of
these
three
cases.
automobiles,
automobiles
last
more
than
the
one
year
period
covered
by
an
income
tax
return.
on
the
other
hand,
they
do
not
last
forever.
at
some
period,
they
are
discarded.
they
are
retired
from
service
and
the
problem
presented
by
these
three
cases
is
how
to
determine
what
proportion
of
the
cost
of
an
asset
which
lasts
more
than
the
period
covered
by
the
income
tax
return,
what
proportion
of
that
cost
shall
be
allocated
to
the
income
tax
year
covered
by
any
particular
return?
i
say
the
problem
arises
because
the
asset
itself
lasts
beyond
the
period
covered
by
the
return.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
it
would
be
a
rule
of
general
application.
i
cited
automobile
simply
as
an
example
of
a
tangible
asset
whose
--
which
lasts
beyond
the
one
year
tax
period
normally
covered
by
an
income
tax
return.
it
could
apply
to
heavy
machinery,
could
apply
to
any
type
of
asset
used
in
industry
or
business,
which
would
last
beyond
the
period
covered
by
the
return.
now,
if
i
can
absolutely
dispute
at
the
outset
in
this
fashion,
i
would
say
that
the
basic
position
for
which
the
government
contends
here
is
simply
this
that
in
determining
the
cost
of
the
asset
which
ought
to
be
allocated
to
the
income
tax
period
covered
by
the
return,
one
ought
to
take
into
account
as
a
relevant
material
in
the
persuasive
factor,
the
total
period
of
time
the
taxpayer
expects
to
use
the
asset.
having
made
that
computation,
one
must
take
into
account
that
portion
of
the
assets'
value
which
the
taxpayer
will
get
back
when
he
disposes
of
the
asset.
if
he
sells
the
asset,
that
portion
which
he
receives
upon
sale
proceeds
represents
a
return
of
his
original
outlay
in
acquiring
the
asset.
to
that
extent,
he
has
not
incurred
a
cost
in
using
the
asset
and
therefore
we
must
exclude
the
proceeds
he
receives
as
a
factor
in
computing
what
his
cost
has
actually
been.
the
taxpayer
on
the
other
hand
as
we
understand
it
says,
“no.
you
must
disregard
the
period
that
the
tax
that
the
--
that
we
will
use
the
asset.
you
must
disregard
the
price
we
will
receive
for
the
asset
when
we
dispose
of
it.
you
must
disregard
that
despite
the
most
compelling
evidence
of
it,
despite
the
past
history
of
our
business
operations”
and
that
really
is
a
crystallization
of
what
dispute
comes
down
to
in
these
three
cases.
now,
the
question
is
of
a
major
importance
in
the
computation
of
income
under
the
internal
revenue
code
because
of
dual
aspects
in
which
it
affects
taxpayers.
first,
depreciation
is
a
deduction
from
gross
income
so
that
the
larger
the
depreciation
deduction,
the
less
the
gross
income.
on
the
other
hand
of
course,
the
smaller
the
depreciation
deduction,
the
greater
the
gross
income.
of
course
gross
income
or
net
income
on
the
tax
returns
would
be
taxed
at
what
we
call
the
ordinary
income
tax
rates.
those
which
can
go
to
a
maximum
of
52%
in
the
case
of
corporations
and
of
course
a
good
deal
higher
than
75,
80
and
past
that
in
the
case
of
individuals.
on
the
other
hand,
the
question
of
depreciation
is
important
in
another
aspect
and
that
is
when
the
time
comes
for
the
taxpayer
to
dispose
of
his
asset,
his
car,
his
plant,
his
piece
of
equipment,
his
electric
motor,
whatever
it
may
be,
when
that
time
comes,
he
has
made
a
sale,
let
us
say
we
must
determine
what
is
the
gain
or
the
loss
which
he
has
realized
upon
the
sale.
now,
in
order
to
do
that,
we
must
determine
what
the
taxpayer's
basis
for
the
asset
is.
basis
is
another
way
for
our
purposes
at
least
here
of
describing
the
cost
to
the
taxpayer,
if
he
paid
a
thousand
dollars
for
it
that
is
his
basis
or
his
cost.
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
time
comes
to
sell
it
to
the
extent
that
he
has
taken
depreciation
deductions,
to
that
extent
he
has
already
recovered
tax-free
his
cost
and
so
we
must
reduce
the
basis
by
the
amount
of
depreciation
and
consequently
the
larger
the
amount
of
depreciation
the
larger
the
deduction
from
his
cost
and
the
lower
the
basis;
on
the
other
hand
the
smaller
the
depreciation
deduction,
the
higher
the
basis.
now,
this
is
very
material
because
in
computing
the
gain
or
loss,
we
match
the
basis
with
the
sales
proceeds
so
that
if
the
taxpayer
has
a
low
basis
as
he
would
if
he
took
large
depreciation
deductions,
he
would
show
larger
gain
upon
the
sale.
now,
the
significance
of
the
larger
gain
upon
the
sale
is
simply
this.
under
the
provisions
of
the
code,
the
gain
upon
the
sale
of
these
assets
used
in
a
trade
or
business
which
are
subject
to
depreciation
is
taxable
at
capital
gain
rates
which
are
a
maximum
of
25%
so
that
it
is
to
a
taxpayer's
advantage
to
increase
the
amount
of
depreciation
because
although
by
increasing
depreciation
he
lowers
basis
and
consequently
increases
profits
upon
a
sale
when
he
ultimately
disposes
of
the
asset,
he
is
very,
very
happy
to
pay
larger
--
larger
tax
of
25%
by
--
by
taking
the
advantage
of
greater
depreciation
deductions
which
are
worth
to
him
52%
in
the
case
of
most
corporations
and
perhaps
more
in
the
case
of
various
individuals.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
well,
i
would
what
makes
us
unhappy
is
the
distortion
in
the
matching
of
income
and
costs
which
the
taxpayer's
theory
produces
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
i
would
say
that
even
if
the
--
there
were
no
capital
gain
rate
applicable
upon
the
disposition
of
these
assets,
even
if
it
with
the
same
tax
rate
in
each
instance,
there
would
still
be
a
disproportion
and
a
distortion
in
the
report
of
the
taxpayer's
income
and
it
would
still
be
offensive
to
our
notions
of
what
the
purpose
of
the
depreciation
deduction
should
serve.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
say
as
a
general
proposition,
it
would
not.
in
a
case
of
any
particular
taxpayer
might
be
of
great
importance
to
him
whether
he
took
more
for
depreciation
in
the
year
one
or
whether
he
took
less
in
the
year
one
and
had
different
consequence
in
the
years
two
or
three.
so
that,
i
think
we're
dealing
here
with
the
fundamental
concept
which
is
not
--
not
determined
by
the
difference
in
the
tax
rates.
i
suggest
that
difference
merely
to
indicate
the
motivation
for
taxpayer,
in
this
instance
taking
a
position
which
increases
the
amount
of
depreciation
although
at
a
cost
of
paying
a
greater
capital
gains
tax
when
the
time
comes
to
dispose
of
the
asset.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
would
-
i
would
say
that
our
position
would
not
be
different
if
upon
a
sale
of
the
asset
the
taxpayer
would
have
pay
an
ordinary
income
tax
upon
the
gain
on
the
sale.
our
position
is
not
dependent
upon
the
applicability
of
that
difference
in
rate.
our
position
follows,
we
believe,
from
our
view
with
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
depreciation
deduction
and
the
--
an
attempt
to
prevent
a
distortion
of
income
over
the
years
which
the
taxpayer
is
using
the
asset.
now,
in
the
evans'
case,
the
case
arises
under
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
and
again,
here,
i
can
capsulate
very
simply,
evans
bought
cars
cheaply
because
he
was
in
the
rental
business
and
he
could
get
a
discount
price
from
new
car
dealers.
on
the
other
hand,
when
he
finished
using
them
in
his
rental
business,
he
could
sell
them
on
an
awfully
good
price
in
the
wholesale
market.
for
example,
in
one
of
the
years
in
issue,
1951,
the
difference
is
spread
between
what
evans
paid
for
these
cars
when
new
and
what
he
received
for
them
when
he
sold
them
as
used
cars
was
only
a
$100
on
the
average.
but
mr.
evans
contends
that
he
is
entitle
to
deduct
for
deprecation
that
is
as
evidencing
the
cost
to
him
of
using
the
car
in
his
rental
business
$450,
four
and
a
half
times
what
in
our
view
is
the
actual
cost
to
him.
now
the
result
for
mr.
evans
is
a
very,
very
pleasant
result.
for
example
in
19
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
bases
that
$450
depreciation
on
the
theory
that
he
may
disregard
the
time
he
actually
uses
the
car
in
his
rental
business.
he
may
disregard
the
proceeds
which
he
receives
when
he
disposes
of
that
car
and
computed
depreciation
on
some
other
basis,
a
basis
which
i
can
only
describe
as
one
which
envisions
a
hypothetical
taxpayer
in
business
who
on
the
hypothetical
conditions
uses
this
hypothetical
car
for
approximately
on
the
average
four
years
and
who
when
he
disposes
of
it
at
the
end
of
that
four-year
period
realizes
nothing,
he
junks
the
car.
now,
taking
that
view,
four
years
will
allow
him
to
deduct
25%
of
the
cost
of
his
asset
each
year.
well,
25%
of
the
average
car
let's
say
which
cost
$1600
is
$400
in
one
year
but
mr.
evans
uses
these
cars
on
the
average
longer
than
one
year.
on
the
other
hand,
when
he
sells
them
on
the
open
market,
he
gets
back
only
$100
less
than
he
paid
for
them.
now,
it's
the
government's
position
that
you
can't
disregard
these
salient
economic
facts
affecting
mr.
evans'
business.
if
he
uses
the
car
for
only
15
months
which
is
what
the
tax
court
found
as
to
sum
of
these
cars,
it
may
not
assume
he
will
use
it
for
four
years.
there
is
no
basis
for
it.
on
the
other
hand,
if
when
he
sells
the
cars,
he
recoups
almost
all
of
his
cost
about
$100,
it
distorts
his
income
to
permit
him
to
reflect
on
his
tax
return
that
the
use
of
the
assets
for
the
period
covered
by
the
return
is
actually
cost
him
$450
rather
than
the
$100.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
four-year
basis
is
derived
from
a
publication
of
the
internal
revenue
service
which
is
called
probable
useful
lives
and
which
defines
the
--
based
upon
the
usual
experience
of
property
owners
what
the
usual
experience
will
reflect
in
terms
of
the
years
which
an
asset
will
be
held
and
used
by
a
taxpayer
and
it
is
precisely
that.
it
is
a
starting
point,
based
upon
usual
experience
which
is
to
be
modified
by
the
pertinent
economic
facts
affecting
the
particular
taxpayer's
situation.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
i
would
say
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
from
--
from
general
business
use,
general
businesses.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
well,
as
generally
all
businesses
but
even
as
to
that
for
example
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
car
is
operated
generally
in
business.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
it
is
not
to
be
applied
in
that
instance.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
i
would
say
that
the
taxpayer's
argument
here
is
that
they
are
entitled
to
use
this
model
and
disregard
the
pertinent
economic
facts
surrounding
(inaudible)
of
the
asset.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
was
coming
to
that.
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
contention
here
that
the
practice
authorizes
that
and
i
will
come
to
that
next
in
my
argument.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
contend
there
is
no
such
practice.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
can
only
characterize
the
taxpayer's
position
as
this
that
he
urges
he
may
depreciate
the
asset
over
its
average
general
life
for
business
purposes
and
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
all
businesses
and
that
he
may
disregard
the
fact
that
in
his
business,
it
is
the
practice
to
dispose
the
cars
in
15
months
rather
than
four
years.
he
may
disregard
the
fact
that
because
he
buys
at
a
discount
and
sells
in
a
different
market
that
in
fact
he
gets
very,
very
substantially,
the
most
part
of
his
cost
back
when
he
disposes
of
the
asset.
the
taxpayer
says
we
can
disregard
that
because
the
general
experience
in
business
for
all
business
purposes
is
four
years
with
no
value
at
the
end
of
that
four-year
period.
now,
it's
our
position
that
you
cannot
disregard
the
pertinent
economic
facts
and
what
could
be
more
pertinent
since
this
is
after
all
an
analysis
into
what
a
given
asset
costs
a
taxpayer
than
to
determine
what
it
is
you're
getting
back
when
you
finish
with
your
use
of
this
asset.
that
is
a
return
of
your
cost.
that
should
not
be
part
of
the
computation.
taxpayer
would
disregard
the
fact
that
when
he
sells
these
cars,
he
gets
back
in
the
year
1951
all
but
a
$100
of
what
he
paid
for
them.
we
say
it
only
has
a
$100
to
depreciate.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
no.
the
model
is
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
model
is
four
years.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
the
model
--
the
model
is
--
is
proper
but
i
must
emphasize
again,
the
model
is
only
a
starting
point.
it's
a
jumping
off
the
point.
it's
just
a
place
where
you
begin
the
inquiry.
you
start
with
four
years
and
you
modify
up
or
down,
depending
upon
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
concerning
the
taxpayer's
business.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
--
the
purpose
of
this
--
this
bulletin
“f”
which
is
a
list
of
models
contains
literally
thousand
of
items
and
lists
like
periods.
mr.

heffron
bulletin
“f”.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
it
is
table
of
useful
lives
of
depreciable
property
and
it
contains
literally
thousands
of
items
and
gives
model
average
years.
now
the
purpose
of
that
publication
was
to
remove
as
much
of
this
questions
of
useful
life
from
the
area
of
controversy
as
possible.
if
a
taxpayer
use
the
life
period
which
was
set
forth
in
that
model
and
contended
that
he
was
within
the
general
run
of
the
mill
type
of
business
operation
and
that
they
were
no
unusual
circumstances
concerning
his
method
of
operation
which
warranted
a
different
result
why
then
the
number
of
years
set
forth
in
the
publication
could
govern
and
a
controversy
would
be
eliminated.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
would
come
to
the
attention
of
the
agent
or
the
taxpayer
that
there
were
particular
facts
and
circumstances
concerning
his
operation
which
warranted
a
different
result,
at
that
point
in
the
examination
of
the
return,
the
taxpayer
would
show
by
such
basis
as
he
could
why
he
thought
a
different
period
was
warranted.
for
example,
suppose
the
taxpayer
contended
that
because
of
the
climate
in
which
his
cars
were
operating,
four
years
was
too
long.
perhaps
he
operated
in
a
dessert
and
he
contended
that
dessert
conditions
are
such
that
my
use
of
the
car
will
be
limited
to
three
years
but
he
would
--
he
could
show
that
and
those
factors
would
be
taken
into
account.
perhaps,
his
repair
policy
was
not
as
intensive
as
the
average
repair
policy.
perhaps
he
could
show
that
he
didn't
have
the
usual
outlay
for
repairs.
well,
in
that
event,
the
life
of
the
asset
might
have
to
be
revised
downward.
conversely,
it
might
have
to
be
revised
upward
in
the
event
that
there
were
factors
and
circumstances
which
showed
that
the
taxpayer
would
use
the
asset
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
a
problem
may
arise
when
a
new
asset
is
acquired
or
it
may
arise
at
any
time
when
the
taxpayer
is
depreciating
assets
he
already
owns.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
if
the
taxpayer
wants
to
change
the
useful
life.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
he
fills
out
his
return
and
he
takes
the
depreciation
he
thinks
he
is
entitled
to.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
he
believes
that
the
form
is
applicable
in
his
instance,
he
takes
it
according
to
the
form.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
would
say
that
would
be
correct
if
in
fact
it
could
be
shown
that
the
circumstances
were
such.
for
example,
as
in
these
cases
where
in
fact
it
has
been
shown
in
the
record
that
the
taxpayer
does
not
keep
a
car
for
four
years.
he
does
not
get
zero
for
it
when
he
disposes
of
it.
he
keeps
it
on
the
average
and
in
some
cases,
15
months
and
when
he
disposes
off
the
car,
he
gets
very
substantial
amounts
for
them
coming
very
close
to
his
cost.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
third
case
to
be
argued
in
this
group,
the
taxpayer
actually
sells
the
cars
for
more
than
what
he
paid
for
them.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
believe
the
first
edition
of
bulletin
“f”
was
1931.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
say
they
were
dealt
with
in
--
in
precisely
the
same
way.
there
is
no
contention.
taxpayer
is
not
contending
that.
in
1931,
there
was
a
change
in
the
practice.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
--
i
believe
that
while
there
may
not
had
been
any
official
publication
which
listed
the
number
of
years
but
that
has
always
been
the
basis
for
determining
what
the
--
what
the
starting
point
should
be
whether
they
are
economic
or
engineering
studies
or
what
have
you
--
i
believe
there
is
always
been
some
formulation
here,
some
model.
now,
if
i
can
give
a
concrete
example
of
the
results
of
the
taxpayer's
theory,
let
us
assume
that
a
car
cost
$2000,
on
the
taxpayer's
theory,
he
is
entitled
to
take
in
the
course
of
two
years,
50%
of
the
value
of
that
car
because
he
assumes
it
lasts
four
years.
so
he
has
taken
a
thousand
dollars
as
a
deduction
for
his
cost
of
using
the
car.
well,
if
the
taxpayer
at
the
end
of
that
two-year
period
sells
the
car
for
$1500,
the
car
has
only
costing
500.
he
is
taking
$500
too
much.
one
the
other
hand,
if
he
sells
the
car
for
$500,
but
use
of
the
car
for
that
two-year
period
has
cost
him
$1500.
he
is
taking
$500
too
little.
now,
if
the
objective
here
is
the
recovery
of
cost,
we
say
that
this
method
is
purely
arbitrary
and
only
fortuitously
by
accident
results
in
the
recovery
of
cost.
under
the
government's
theory,
if
you
could
show
as
has
been
shown
in
these
cases
that
the
taxpayer
customarily
disposed
of
the
car
in
two
years
and
that
in
on
the
one
hand,
he
customarily
received
$1500
when
he
dispose
of
it,
he
would
only
deduct
500
over
the
two-year
period.
on
the
other
hand,
another
taxpayer
who
customarily
disposed
of
the
car
in
two
years
received
$500
upon
disposal,
he
would
be
entitled
to
deduct
$1500
over
the
two-year
period.
in
this
way,
we
say
that
the
matching
of
costs
and
income
is
met
because
after
all,
what
we
are
seeking
here
is
to
match
the
cost
of
producing
particular
income.
the
car,
the
tangible
asset,
whatever
it
was,
was
used
in
producing
income,
that
income
is
shown
on
the
return.
we're
concerned
with
matching
the
cost
to
the
taxpayer
producing
that
income.
we
say
the
government's
theory
at
least
theoretically
permits
you
to
recover
cost
in
that
way
and
have
a
proper
matching
while
the
taxpayer's
theory
results
in
a
distortion.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
we
go
in
--
we
go
into
the
legislative
history
in
detail
and
i
expect
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
those
were
not
proposals
to
change
the
depreciation
rule.
those
were
proposals
to
change
the
rule
that
upon
the
sale
of
these
business
assets,
the
gain
should
be
treated
as
capital
gain.
they
were
not
proposals
to
change
the
basic
method
of
computing
the
depreciation
deduction.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
the
accelerated
depreciation
refers
to
a
method
of
computing
the
depreciation
deductions
which
gave
greater
deductions
in
earlier
periods
and
that
is
the
issue
in
the
hertz
case
which
i
hope
to
cover
in
my
next
argument.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
was
just
going
to
say
to
the
court
the
language
which
has
consistently
appeared
in
the
regulations
and
which
this
court
adopted
through
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
the
ludey
case
some
time
ago,
that
language
speaking
of
depreciation
is
the
amount
of
the
allowance
to
a
depreciation
is
the
sum
which
should
be
set
aside
for
the
taxable
year
in
order
that
at
the
end
of
the
useful
life
of
the
plant
in
the
business
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
the
business,
plant
in
the
business,
the
aggregate
of
the
sum
set
aside
will
--
with
the
salvage
value
what
is
received
when
he
disposes
of
it,
suffice
to
provide
an
amount
equal
to
the
original
cost
and
i'd
like
to
make
three
observations
with
respect
to
that
quotation
which
is
one
which
has
appeared
in
the
regulations
consistently
which
this
court
placed
as
part
of
its
opinion
in
the
ludey
case
and
which
while
it
appeared
in
the
regulations,
saw
congress
re-enact
10
times
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
first
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
dollar
and
cents
application
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
has
been
our
way
but
i
would
concede
that
the
problem
raised
by
the
rental
car
business
is
a
relatively
new
one
because
this
is
a
relatively
new
business,
but
there
are
analogous
situations
where
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
treasury
has
applied
the
same
principles
and
i
was
going
to
refer
to
them.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
the
cases
which
the
counsels
cites
are
cases
which
used
the
term
useful
life
in
the
sense
in
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
used
that,
in
the
model,
in
the
abstract
sense
and
--
those
were
cases
where
the
question
was,
is
the
taxpayer
holding
the
cars
to
sell
them
or
is
he
holding
them
for
some
other
purpose?
and
the
government
said,
“well,
he's
holding
them
less
than
the
useful
life”
meaning
the
abstract
model,
useful
life
sense,
therefore,
he's
not
holding
them
to
use
them
out.
he's
holding
them
to
sell
them.
that
was
the
only
point
of
using
the
term
in
that
way
and
there
has
to
be
a
way
to
describe
this
abstract
concept,
this
model
useful
life,
but
it's
always
applied
to
the
taxpayer
and
what
we
are
talking
about
in
these
cases
are
not
useful
life
in
the
abstract,
but
the
taxpayers
useful
life
because
we're
trying
to
give
the
taxpayer
back
his
cost
in
terms
of
tax
deductions
and
to
define
useful
life
in
terms
which
have
no
pertinence
or
relevance
to
the
taxpayer's
own
cost
or
his
own
mode
of
operation.
it
gives
no
guarantee
whatever
that
he
will
recover
his
cost
through
the
depreciation
deductions
because
after
all,
the
regulation
provides
that
the
proper
amount
is
the
amount
which
should
be
aggregated.
now,
we
say
that
aggregate
amount
must
assume
that
we're
talking
about
an
aggregation
which
will
occur
over
a
period
that
a
taxpayer
is
using
the
property
because
to
aggregate
it
over
some
other
period
makes
no
sense
as
--
for
example
in
the
taxpayer's
example
of
asset
which
has
a
10-year
abstract
life,
if
you
know
the
taxpayer
will
sell
it
in
two
years
or
in
five
years
to
aggregate
10%
a
year
for
two
years
or
five
years
does
not
give
the
taxpayer
back
his
cost.
we
say
in
that
situation,
you
must
take
a
period
of
time
to
with
the
time
the
taxpayer
reasonably
expects
to
use
the
property
whether
a
two,
five,
or
10
years
then
you
have
a
period
whose
aggregate
will
realize
cost,
otherwise,
you
cannot
realize
cost.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
other
than
this
case
and
the
cases
here
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
one
case
which
comes
to
me
off
hand
is
the
recent
collin
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
where
the
sixth
circuit
adopted
a
view
that
useful
life
shall
be
the
period
which
the
taxpayers
actually
holding
the
property
rather
than
some
other
abstract
model
period.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
first,
there
was
testimony
in
both
the
evans
and
hertz
cases,
if
i
may
advert
to
them
for
a
moment,
that
in
the
past,
the
taxpayers
had
used
cars
in
the
rental
business
for
five,
six,
and
as
much
as
seven
years.
so
the
absence
of
any
--
showing
here
of
the
disallowance
of
the
claim
for
depreciation,
i
think,
has
no
weight
whatever,
until
we
know
what
precisely,
the
facts
were
with
respect
to
the
practice
to
any
--
in
any
particular
year.
of
course,
also,
the
government
is
not
contending
for
a
rule
which
would
provide
that
if,
in
fact,
the
taxpayer
disposes
of
a
particular
asset
at
a
certain
time,
that
fixes
its
useful
life.
this
is
a
rule
based
upon
experience
as
all
depreciation
is
and
the
fact
of
a
disposition
at
a
particular
time
only
if
cumulated
over
a
rather
lengthy
period
of
time
would
result
in
a
sufficient
showing
of
past
experience
to
provide
a
basis
for
drawing
the
inference
that
as
a
reasonable
expectation,
this
taxpayer
will
only
hold
a
car
for
a
given
period
of
time.
now,
with
all
the
--
old
board
of
tax
field
cases,
which
had
been
referred
to
and
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
it
is
true
that
there
are
some
mention
made
that
the
taxpayer
traded
in
cars
from
time
to
time
in
two
years.
although
the
commissioner
was
contending
for
a
useful
life
of
a
four
years,
but
there
was
never
a
showing
in
those
cases
that
this
practice
had
reached
such
dimensions
and
had
continued
for
such
a
period
of
time
that
the
commissioner
would've
been
warranted
in
saying
on
the
basis
of
your
past
experience,
we
cannot
apply
four
years,
we
must
make
it
less.
there's
no
showing
in
the
records
in
those
cases
that
those
facts
were
ever
placed
in
evidence.
and
this
whole
concept
of
useful
life,
as
we
define
it,
is
based
upon
a
factual
showing
of
past
experience.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
not
for
purposes
of
computing
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
depreciation
reduction.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
depreciation.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
this
is
not
a
rule
based
on
hindsight.
if
the
estimate
was
reasonable
to
begin
with,
based
upon
past
experience,
it
is
not
changed
because
in
fact,
taxpayer
disposes
of
it
in
a
shorter
period
of
time,
that
this
is
not
changed
with
respect
to
prior
years,
as
to
which
deductions
have
already
been
taken.
we
don't
upset
the
(inaudible)
years
later,
because
the
taxpayer
in
fact,
disposed
of
his
asset
in
a
shorter
period
of
time.
if
the
reasonable
expectation
he
had,
when
he
acquired
the
asset,
is
found
that
upon
past
experience
and
an
adequate
body
of
it.
now,
contrary
to
what
my
adversary
has
argued,
useful
life
had
never
meant
--
never
meant
inherent
or
abstract
useful
life
or
as
he
calls
it,
inherent
economic
life.
all
the
regulations,
all
the
administrative
materials,
bulletin
“f”
and
it
does
in
different
places
is
key
to
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
taxpayer's
operation.
it
says
specifically,
his
repair
policy
must
be
taken
into
account.
it
says
specifically,
the
amount
of
use
he
gives
it,
must
be
taken
into
account.
the
needs
of
his
growing
business
must
be
taken
into
account.
inadequacy
to
the
needs
of
his
business
must
be
taken
into
account.
in
short,
the
concept
has
never
been
an
abstract
one.
it
has
always
been
a
very
specific
detailed
inquiry
into
all
of
the
circumstances,
those
which
affect
the
physical
rate
of
the
decay
and
those
which
affect
the
economic
determination
of
life.
all
of
those
factors
have
been
taken
into
account
and
there
is
no
taxpayer
who
can
state
that
under
the
regulations
or
the
administrative
materials,
or
the
cases
that
he
could
draw
the
inference
that
a
government
would
disregard
every
part
in
an
economic
fact
relating
to
his
business
in
setting
the
term
of
useful
life.
that
is
just
not
so
and
i
could
state
that
unequivocally
to
the
court.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
in
that
instance
probably,
we
might
have
to
resort
to
the
experience
in
the
industry.
but
it
has
never
been
the
case
that
the
abstract
concept
of
useful
life
applied
as
i
read
from
bulletin
“f”
it
is
a
starting
point
because
you
have
to
have
a
starting
point
in
these
cases.
and
as
the
starting
point
based
on
experience
that
is
true,
but
one
which
always
has
to
be
modified
depending
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
that's
why
we
modify
it
for
repair
policy.
that's
we
modify
it
for
climate.
that's
why
we
modify
it
for
operating
conditions.
and
we
say
that
is
why
we
modify
it
because
of
the
conditions
of
the
rental
industry,
to
wit,
customers
demand
new
cars
or
late
model
cars.
that's
an
economic
fact
of
life.
no
rental
car
company
can
disregard.
they
don't
disregard
it
in
fact,
because
they
buy
and
sell
cars
on
an
average
of
two
years.
why
should
they
be
permitted
to
disregard
it
for
purposes
of
depreciation
when
we
are
looking
for
cost?
now,
massey
motors
is
a
case
which
is
a
kin
to
the
other
two
cases.
it
simply
presents,
in
exaggerated
form,
the
consequences
of
this
artificial,
unreal
concept
to
of
useful
life.
here
is
the
taxpayer
who
buys
a
car
for
$1800.
he
sells
it
within
the
year
for
$1900.
and
he
says
the
cost
of
using
the
car
to
me
is
in
this
case,
he
took
one-third.
it
is
one-third
of
$1800
therefore,
i
may
deduct
$600,
as
the
cost
of
using
the
car
to
me.
and
if
he's
under
the
1954
code
and
he
uses
the
double
declining
balance,
he
doubles
the
one-third.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
he
doubles
it
to
two-thirds.
and
he
says
two-thirds
of
this
cost
or
$1200
is
what
it
cost
me
to
use
this
asset
during
this
year
in
my
business.
in
fact,
he's
made
a
profit
of
one
year
and
he's
used
it
in
his
business
free
of
charge.
now,
that's
precisely
what
this
case
involves
and
it's
the
government's
position
that
all
of
the
materials,
all
of
the
materials,
when
reasonably
analyzed,
lend
themselves
to
no
other
conclusion
and
that
all
the
economic
facts
of
life
must
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
the
contentions
in
the
other
two
issues?
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
this
case,
the
concept
of
useful
life
which
would
govern
in
the
other
two
or
to
govern
this
case.
we
say
that
the
concept
of
useful
life
is
the
same
for
all
these
taxpayers.
and
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
the
petition
--
the
petition
which
was
filed
by
the
taxpayer,
he
raises
the
issue
in
principle
of
whether
our
concept
of
useful
life
or
his,
should
govern.
the
question
of
whether
the
evidence
of
prior
practice
and
holding
period
is
such
as
to
warrant
the
conclusion
that
the
three-year
period
he
used
was
too
long
or
too
short,
was
not
considered
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
was
not
alleged
as
a
ground
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
this
court
was
brought
here
simply
for
the
purpose
of
defining
the
concept
of
useful
life.
when
that
is
done,
the
irrelevant
evidence
can
be
in
adduced
below.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
that
is
not
before
the
court
here.
we
have
conceded
it
as
depreciable
property.
the
question
is
the
appropriate
measure.
now,
not
only
to
only
administrative
materials
referred
to
the
economic
facts
of
life
here,
but
the
tax
--
the
testimony
in
the
hertz
case
and
in
the
evans
case,
developed
the
economic
facts
of
life.
why
do
you
hold
cars
only
for
two
years?
one
of
the
hertz
officials
was
asked.
well,
he
said,
“because
after
two
years,
it
cost
too
much
to
repair
them,
compared
to
what
we
can
get
for
them,
if
we
sell
them.”
well,
of
course,
that's
the
reason
why
they
hold
them
that
short
of
time.
why
disregard
the
economic
fact
of
life
when
all
the
other
economic
facts
of
life
must
be
taken
into
account,
and
how
could
any
taxpayer
rationally
conclude
that
where
all
the
regulations,
where
the
administrative
materials
were
bulletin
“f”
said,
time
and
time
again,
that
you
must
take
into
account,
all
of
the
facts
pertaining
to
your
situation.
how
could
he
arbitrarily,
exclude
the
fact
--
the
salient
economic
fact
of
life
in
his
business,
that
his
customers
demand
new
cars,
so
he
can't
use
them
longer
than
two
years.
we
say
that
is
--
that's
the
critical
economic
fact
in
this
business.
it
is
not
in
other
businesses.
the
critical
economic
fact
in
the
case
decided
by
this
court
in
munitions
was
that
the
ammunitions
industry
was
no
longer
needed,
the
war
was
over.
well,
the
plant
was
perfectly
good
to
manufacture.
in
the
abstract
sense,
it
had
many
years
of
life.
the
reason
this
court
granted
a
shorter
period
was
because
it
took
cognizance
of
the
particular
economic
facts
affecting
the
taxpayer's
business.
now,
this
is
not
a
new
concept
which
was
developed
for
purposes
of
tax
law.
this
is
a
concept
that
has
appeared
in
many
accounting
predecease
over
long
periods
of
time.
and
i
can
cite
--
and
any
number
of
them
to
the
court.
or
the
accountants'
handbook,
in
the
1934
edition,
talking
about
the
causes
of
depreciation,
lists
as
among
them
inadequacy.
in
general
assets
become
inadequate,
when
changes
in
operating
conditions
and
demand
for
product
rendered
them
unsuited
for
further
service
under
the
particular
conditions
prevailing.
cessation
of
demand,
“a
piece
of
equipment
may
be
entirely
adequate
for
the
purpose
intended
and
of
the
very
latest
and
most
improved
type,
but
if
service
life
is
gone
when
the
demand
for
the
product
has
disappeared,
well,
the
demand
for
rental
cars
more
than
two
years
of
age
disappears.
it
disappears
because
the
public
wants
new
cars.
that's
an
economic
fact
of
life.
now,
there
are
many
other
references
all
--
all
to
the
same
affect
in
many
of
the
other
accounting
predecease
which
i've
called
simply
at
random,
because
this
is
a
concept
which
has
been
--
which
was
figure
in
depreciation
for
a
long
period
of
time.
for
example,
in
a
dictionary
for
accountants,
published
in
1952,
before
the
new
code
and
before
the
new
regulations.
there's
a
--
there's
a
statement
by
the
author,
“depreciation
expense
computations
are
thus
based
on
the
assumption
that
every
fixed
asset
with
the
exception
of
land,
has
a
limited
life.
the
cost
of
the
asset
less
whatever
can
be
anticipated
in
the
way
of
scrap
is
a
prepaid
expense
that
must
somehow
be
spread
over
its
operating
life
in
the
hands
of
its
present
owner.”
now,
there
is
a
statement
which
we
submit
and
directly
supports
our
position.
now,
there
are
other
statements
--
there
are
statements
in
the
opinions
of
this
court.
for
example,
in
the
opinion
in
the
virginian
hotel
case
decided
in
1943.
this
court
stated,
“the
congress
has
provided
for
deductions
of
annual
amounts
of
depreciation,
which
along
with
salvage
value
will
replace
the
original
investment
of
the
property
at
the
time
of
its
retirement.”
well,
how
can
you
replace
the
original
investment
in
the
property,
if
you
are
not
computing
the
time
of
retirement
based
upon
the
economic
effects
or
facts
which
affect
the
taxpayer?
if
you
based
them
on
some
abstract
notion
of
time
of
retirement,
you
cannot
recover
the
original
investment.
so
that,
we
say
that
all
of
the
materials
have
indicated
consistently
that
every
economic
fact
of
life
must
be
taken
into
account
and
if
they
haven't
explicitly
stated
it
with
respect
to
the
car
rental
business,
it
has
been
implicit
and
it
follows
as
a
logical
deduction.
and
we
submit
no
other
conclusion
could
reasonably
be
drawn.
there
is
no
basis
for
ignoring
the
economic
facts
here,
which
operate
to
the
detriment
of
the
taxpayer
and
taking
all
others
into
account.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
cases
in
this
court
and
other
courts
(inaudible)
applied
the
rule
that
all
pertinent
economic
factors
relating
to
the
taxpayer's
business
must
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
useful
life
of
his
property
for
purposes
of
the
depreciation
deduction.
that
same
thing
is
elaborated
by
this
court
in
a
case
decided
in
1940,
real
estate
company
against
the
united
states,
where
it
has
said,
“for
obsolescence
under
the
act,
requires
that
the
operative
cause
of
the
present
or
growing
uselessness
arise
from
external
forces
which
make
it
desirable
or
imperative
that
the
property
be
replaced.
what
these
operative
causes
maybe
will
be
dependent
on
a
wide
variety
of
factual
situations.
we
say
that
here,
we
have
an
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i'm
sorry.
that's
not
in
our
brief.
that's
at
309
u.s.
13.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
real
estate
company
against
the
united
states
and
the
cartridge
company
case,
which
i
cited
earlier,
is
at
284
u.s.
511.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
right.
the
concept
of
depreciation
subsumes
within
it,
not
simply
physical
deterioration,
but
any
other
operative
cause
which
results
in
lowering
the
period
--
lessening
the
period
of
usefulness
to
the
taxpayer.
in
the
munitions
case,
it
was
the
cessasion
of
demand
because
of
the
war.
in
--
in
other
cases,
it
was
the
power
plant's
inadequacy
to
fulfill
the
needs
the
community.
in
this
case,
it
is
the
inability
of
a
three
year
old
car
to
be
offered
for
rent
because
customers
demand
more
recent
cars.
in
all
of
these
situations
and
there
are
a
host
to
them,
i've
only
mentioned
a
few.
all
of
these
external
causes,
unconnected
with
physical
wear
and
tear,
have
been
taken
into
account
as
they
bear
upon
a
particular
facts
and
circumstances
pertaining
to
the
taxpayer's
situation.
now,
this
is
also
a
concept
which
has
been
well
recognized
in
the
accounting
predecease
from
the
earliest
days
in
kester,
on
accounting,
a
1925
edition.
in
discussing
the
various
factors
in
depreciation
and
scrap
value
kester
says,
“there
is
a
close
relation
between
the
operation
of
the
chief
factors
and
depreciation
on
the
scrap
value
of
the
asset.
thus,
if
it
is
estimated
that
physical
depreciation
will
be
complete
in
eight
years,
obsolescence
in
10
years
and
inadequacy
in
12
years,
scrap
value
would
be
slight.”
yes,
because
physical
depreciation
have
already
have
run
in
its
course.
if
however,
inadequacy
is
the
controlling
factor
such
as
in
this
case,
becoming
operative
in
eight
years
with
obsolescence
in
10
years
and
physical
depreciation
in
12
years,
clearly
scrap
value
might
be
quite
appreciable.
it
would
be
quite
appreciable,
of
course,
because
when
the
taxpayer
disposes
of
it
after
of
it's
inadequate
for
his
business,
full
physical
depreciation
hasn't
run
its
course,
so
it's
available
for
use
by
other
businesses,
my
other
taxpayers.
now
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that's
right.
the
--
the
use
of
the
asset
has
caused
him
nothing
in
his
business.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that's
correct.
now,
under
massey's
theory,
by
taking
this
--
this
very
great
deduction
for
depreciation,
he
--
he
assures
himself
for
paying
a
much
higher
capital
gains
tax,
but
he
exchanges
for
that
--
of
the
--
the
different
rates,
of
course.
every
dollar
and
excess
depreciation
he
takes
is
–-
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
it
was
actually
massey
--
held
them
for
one
year.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
he
was
taking
a
third
each
year.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that's
right.
and
so
that
each
dollar
would
save
him
52
cents,
he
would
pay
25
cents,
capital
gains
tax
or
a
net
profit
in
hand
of
27
cents.
not
by
a
reason
of
any
difference
in
his
business
operations.
we
really
have
a
very
extraordinary
proposition
here,
because
the
rule
of
cost
is
the
general
rule,
the
taxpayer
is
supposed
to
recover
his
cost
and
no
more.
and
the
rule
that
all
the
economic
factors
must
be
taken
into
an
account
is
designed
to
assure
that
cost
and
no
more
than
cost
is
to
be
recovered.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that
--
that
can
happen
because
we're
dealing
here
with
estimates
and
probabilities
based
on
past
experience
and
there's
a
--
there's
a
good
deal
of
room
here
for
--
within
the
area
of
what
a
reasonable
estimate
is.
i
think
that's
the
reason
for
that,
but
the
concept,
for
example
with
buildings,
buildings
maybe
held
to
be
subject
to
a
lesser
amount
--
to
a
shorter
life
than
otherwise,
because
it
is
anticipated
that
there
will
be
changes
in
the
neighborhood.
that
would
be
one
economic
factor
not
related
to
physical
wear
and
tear,
which
cuts
down
his
life.
that's
a
common
occurrence
in
the
case
of
real
estate,
but
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
remaining,
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
extraordinary
proposition
we
have
here.
the
concept
that
all
economic
forces
must
be
taken
into
account,
to
reduce
the
useful
life
of
the
taxpayer,
has
been
applied
in
a
wide
variety
of
cases
and
industries,
in
the
power
industry,
as
i've
cited.
in
the
munitions
industry,
in
real
estate,
in
every
other
type
of
--
of
business
which
is
conducted,
the
taxpayer's
proposition
then,
must
come
down
to
this,
that
despite
the
fact
--
despite
the
fact
that
those
rules
have
been
consistently
applied
and
all
these
other
cases,
we,
in
the
auto
rental
business,
are
entitled
to
a
different
rule,
because
of
the
commissioner's
practice.
now,
this
is
an
extraordinary
proposition.
it
is
not
a
contention
that
the
regulations
are
invalid,
because
they
are
unreasonable,
because
they
are
not
inconformity
with
the
statute.
indeed,
the
1954
regulations
are
precisely
in
point
here
and
specifically
set
forth
the
concept
of
useful
life
and
salvage
value,
for
which
the
government
contends.
so
this
is
an
extraordinary
proposition,
says
these
regulations
are
invalid.
it
says
all
this
history
of
application
and
under
--
other
industries,
may
not
be
applied
to
us.
it's
an
extraordinary
contention
and
of
course,
it
results
in
a
very
great
discrimination
among
taxpayers.
all
other
taxpayers
can
only
depreciate
upon
the
basis
of
cost.
taxpayers
in
the
car
rental
business,
if
these
taxpayers
sustain,
can
depreciate
on
a
basis
other
that
cost.
they
can
convert
ordinary
income
in
the
capital
gains.
irrespective
of
the
cost,
the
taxpayer
who
sells
a
car
for
$100
more
than
he
pays
or
it,
can
deduct
$600
or
$800
in
depreciation.
no
one
else
is
entitled
to
that.
now,
in
one
of
the
taxpayer
got
what
does
he
offer
this
court
to
demonstrate
that
this
sort
of
discrimination
should
be
applied?
he
doesn't
have
65%
of
the
auto
leasing
industry
in
support,
because
as
our
evidence
brief
shows,
the
automobile
leasing
association,
which
represents
65%
of
the
industry,
has
stated
that
they
are
fully
in
agreement
with
the
government's
position
and
that
that
has
always
been
the
rule
and
the
practice
and
that
they
support
it.
so
he
doesn't
have
that.
he
doesn't
have
any
specific
cases
which
deal
with
the
precise
issue
presented
in
this
case.
he
has
a
good
many
cases
in
which
taxpayers
traded
in
from
time
to
time,
cars
and
he
says,
“well,
since
they,
in
fact,
traded
in
the
cars,
why
didn't
you
cut
down
their
useful
life?”
the
answer
is
very
simple.
we
don't
cut
down
useful
life
simply
because
in
fact,
the
car
has
been
traded
in
or
disposed
of
in
a
shorter
period.
depreciation
is
based
upon
experience.
we
cut
it
down
because
past
experience
relating
to
this
economic
factor
as
it
does,
as
past
experience
governs
the
application
of
all
of
it,
economic
factors
is
the
test.
now,
it
is
true,
we
haven't
by
some
ibm
method,
pulled
all
the
returns
of
all
the
taxpayers
in
the
car
rental
business
who
has
ever
taken
depreciation.
on
the
other
hand,
the
taxpayer
hasn't
shown
any
specific
car
rental
cases
dealing
with
the
contention
of
useful
life,
which
he
asserts
the
--
the
government
made
in
those
cases.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
peculiar
mathematics
of
it
may
--
may
illustrate
a
very
good
reason
why
the
question
may
not
have
been
raised.
if
a
taxpayer
takes
a
four-year
useful
life
and
in
fact,
disposes
of
the
car
in
two
years,
he's
taken
half
the
value.
well,
if
in
fact,
he
disposes
of
it
in
two
years
and
when
he
sells
it,
receives
half
the
value,
no
matter
with
--
which
method
of
computation
you
use,
the
government's
or
the
taxpayer's,
the
result
is
the
same.
because
in
fact,
under
the
taxpayer's
method,
he's
taken
50%
of
the
full
price
of
the
car,
under
the
government's
method,
he
has
taken
all
of
the
spread
between
the
price
of
the
car
and
the
sales
proceed
which
is
precisely
the
same
figure.
if
the
car
is
$2000
and
he
takes
50%
on
a
four-year
useful
life,
he's
deducted
$1000
in
depreciation.
if
under
the
government's
theory,
the
useful
life
of
that
car
is
two
years,
he's
entitled
to
deduct
to
the
difference
between
$2000
and
$1000,
what
he
receives
upon
sale
over
a
two-year
period.
he
deducts
the
same
$1000,
so
that
in
any
given
instance,
simply
because
a
taxpayer
has
used
what
appears
to
be
a
lengthier
period,
there
is
no
reason
to
assert
that
in
fact,
the
computation
result
that
in
giving
him
the
benefit
of
this
depreciation
below
cost,
which
he
is
asserting,
he's
entitled
to
hear.
because
of
the
peculiar
relation
of
the
mathematics,
you
can't
tell
from
any
specific
case,
whether
four
years
resulted
in
more
depreciation
under
the
taxpayer's
theory
than
it
would
have
at
two
years
or
some
other
period
been
taken,
under
the
government's
theory.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
what
introduces
the
problem
in
this
case
is
the
--
is
both
of
the
extraordinarily
high
salvage
value
plus
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
customarily
does
not
retain
the
cars
for
more
than
the
period
which
has
been
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
set
forth.
they're
related
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
they're
really
reciprocals.
the
longer
you
hold
the
car,
the
less
the
salvage
value,
the
shorter
the
period,
presumably,
the
more
the
salvage
value.
but
--
so
we
have
in
essence,
the
taxpayer
contending
for
this
extraordinary
proposition
that
he
and
the
auto
rental
business
is
entitled
to
deduct
below
cost,
irrespective
of
cost,
irrespective
of
the
command
of
the
statute
for
a
reasonable
allowance,
irrespective
of
the
restrictions
placed
upon
lessees,
upon
the
owners
of
mining
property,
upon
the
holders
of
bridges
with
franchisers,
upon
power
plants
and
all
the
other
situations
to
which
we've
adverted.
and
in
support
of
that,
he
offers
nothing
but
a
few
cases
taken
from
the
--
and
a
whole
board
of
tax
appealed
reports,
which
do
not
deal
with
this
issue
at
all.
the
mere
fact
that
in
any
given
record,
it
appears
that
a
taxpayer
is
disposed
of
a
car
in
any
given
period
of
time,
there's
no
reason
to
change
the
estimate
of
useful
life.
we're
looking
--
we're
basing
it
upon
the
past
experience
of
the
taxpayer
and
we
need
a
bulk
of
that
experience,
so
we
can
draw
that
inference.
now,
we
tried
to
show
to
the
court
how,
if
the
ultimate
objective
of
depreciation
is
to
be
the
recovery
of
cost,
which
has
been
the
objective
which
this
court
has
set
forth
is
the
one
--
and
which
is
the
one
the
objectives
set
forth
in
the
regulations,
which
has
always
been
the
goal
in
this
field.
the
taxpayer's
theory
cannot
result
in
the
recovery
of
cost,
unless
purely
by
accident,
when
the
taxpayer
disposes
of
his
property
in
two
years,
it
happens
to
be
at
50%
if
the
taxpayer
was
taking
four
year
life
at
25%
each
year.
but
to
the
taxpayer
disposes
of
it
for
a
little
more
than
50%
or
the
taxpayer
disposes
of
it
for
a
little
less,
there's
no
recovery
of
cost
here.
there's
either
too
much
or
too
less
and
because
the
taxpayers
theory
would
disregard,
he
disregards
the
facts,
the
past
experience,
he
would
disregard
what
he
knows
he
can
get
for
the
car,
he
would
disregard
what
he
knows
is
the
period
he
will
hold
the
car.
he
--
he
blinds
himself
to
these
factors
making
the
recovery
of
course
--
of
cost
an
absolutely
hit
on
this
proposition.
the
reason
he
does
that
is
quite
clear,
because
to
the
extent
he
can
ignore
reality
and
take
larger
depreciation
deductions
below
cost,
to
that
extent,
he
can
convert
ordinary
income
into
capital
gains.
now,
the
situation
is
exaggerated
under
the
1954
code
because
of
the
accelerated
methods
of
depreciation.
a
taxpayer
who
takes
a
four-year
useful
life
instead
of
25%,
will
take
50%
the
first
year,
so
that
if
the
car
cost
him
$2000
and
he
sells
it,
he
takes
$1000
deduction
even
though
he
may
as
in
the
massey
motor
case,
sell
it
for
$2200
or
$2500,
the
wholly
artificial
concept
which
has
no
relation
to
the
economic
facts
at
all
and
the
regulations
under
the
1954
code
are
quite
clear
in
this
regard
and
they
spell
out
in
detail,
the
government's
theory.
the
taxpayers
have
suggested
no
reason
why
those
regulations
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
it
is
our
view
that
the
1954
code
regulations
support
our
position.
explicitly,
the
taxpayers
would
be
arguing
that
because
of
the
prior
practice
which
we
said
they
haven't
shown
at
all,
but
because
of
the
--
their
new
regulations
must
be
disregarded
even
though
they
maybe
perfectly
valid
under
the
statute.
now,
that's
the
extraordinary
contention.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
by
the
past
practice?
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
i
didn't
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
of
course
not.
under
the
new
regulation
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
they
do
not
--
they
cannot
claim
the
regulation
say
other
than
what
they
do
say,
but
as
i
understand
what
they
do
claim
is
because
of
this
practice
which
they
refer
to.
they're
entitled
to
disregard
the
explicit
and
in
the
new
regulations
case,
it
is
explicit.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
command
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that
would
be
their
argument
in
the
--
in
the
hertz
case
as
to
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
1954
code
years.
the
massey
motors
case
follows
only
the
1939
code.
but
in
fact,
under
that
1954
code
years,
the
argument
would
have
to
be
that
despite
the
explicit
command
of
the
regulations,
they
maybe
disregarded
not
because
they
conflict
with
the
statute,
not
because
they're
unreasonable,
but
because
of
this
prior
practice
to
which
the
taxpayers
have
adverted.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
say
that's
where
it
comes
down
to.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that
is
a
--
that
is
another
argument
they
make
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
except
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
except
that
theory
upon
which
is
--
that
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
in
hertz
found
that
you
could
not
apply
the
regulations
retroactive.
it
was
the
theory
which
assumed
that
the
1954
code
had
changed
the
law
so
that
even
as
to
any
years
which
arose
under
the
1954
code,
we
say
those
regulations
which
were
inconformity
with
the
1954
code,
even
assuming
it
made
a
change
would
nevertheless
be
applicable.
there's
no
retroactivity
of
enforcing
regulations
under
a
new
statute.
even
though
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
the
1956
regulations
are
in
terms,
applicable
to
all
tax
years
arising
under
the
1954
code
even
though
those
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
would
include
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
the
hertz
case.
even
though,
in
fact,
those
years
occurred
prior
to
the
promulgation
of
the
regulations
in
final
form.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
--
that
may
have
been
a
portion
of
their
argument
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
as
i
understood
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
--
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
what
the
retroactive
point
is
this
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes
--
no,
well
on
the
retro,
i
misunderstood.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
if
i
--
on
the
retroactive
point,
the
district
judge
said
in
his
findings
that
he
found
that
the
practice
started
out
precisely
as
the
government
contends
it
did
and
he
referred
to
the
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
the
ludey
case
and
he
reached
the
same
conclusion
the
government
does.
however,
he
found
that
by
1942,
there
had
been
a
change
and
useful
life
began
to
mean
what
the
taxpayers
said
it
does.
therefore,
by
1954,
it
had
that
meaning
however,
he
found
the
1954
code
changed
that
rule,
changed
it
in
a
way
that
we
support
the
government's
position
back
to
what
it
had
been
originally.
he
said
therefore,
the
new
regulations
cannot
be
retroactively
applied.
well,
the
answer
to
that
is,
think
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
where
a
statute,
a
new
statute
has
been
enacted
regardless
of
the
old
practice,
if
the
statute
is
new
and
not
the
same
as
the
old
statute,
the
old
regulations
are
not
carried
along
with
it
for
purposes
of
the
new
statute
and
where
there
has
been
a
new
statute,
a
regulation
which
is
promulgated
a
few
years
after
the
new
statute
maybe
retroactively
applied.
that
is
what
we
understand
the
retroactive
contention
to
be.
but
in
terms
of
the
basic
contention
here,
it
has
been
that
the
regulations
have
always
been
directed
to
the
end
of
recovery
of
cost,
the
1954
regulations
were
explicit,
but
they
simply
embodied
the
practice
which
had
grown
up
and
applied
in
all
these
other
instances.
