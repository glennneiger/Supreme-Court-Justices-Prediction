it's
four
years
for
automobiles
and
five
years
for
trucks,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
using
--
using
the
same
figures.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
is
--
i
--
i
am
right,
am
i
not,
i
--
i'm
correct
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i'm
right
when
--
factually
correct
in
thinking
that
in
1942,
the
statute
itself
was
amended
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
the
first
time
deduction
of
certain
non-business
property?
justice

stewart
in
depreciation
deduction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
quite
--
justice
potter

do
you
refer
to
1954
regulations
(voice

--
justice

and
as
to
the
1954
code,
but
promulgated

--

--
is
that
it?
justice

mr.
hefforn,
your
statement
to
us
just
now,
that
you're
not
contending
for
a
rule
which
depends
upon
how
long
the
taxpayer
in
fact,
held
this
particular
asset.
justice
potter
stewart
for
purposes
of
computing
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
rate
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
is
that
statement
to
us,
intended
to
answer
the
last
part
of
mr.
frazier's
argument
in
which
he
anticipated
for
us
various
inequitable
results,
both
with
the
taxpayer
and
for
the
government?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
another
issue
here,
isn't
there,
whether
this
man
is
a
dealer
--
an
automobile
dealer
and
how
does
that
fit
into
this?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
longer
an
issue
in
here
as
to
whether
not,
this
is
properly
used
in
the
trade
or
business
or
anything
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
what
--
introduces
the
problem
is
this
extraordinarily
high
salvage
value
is
that
it?the
problem
in
this
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
relate
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
does
it
also
amount
to
this
that
the
contention
is
that
the
regulations
make
such
a
change
that
if
in
any
event,
they
cannot
be
applied
retrospectively,
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
regulations
were
not
issued
until
1956.
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
i
understand.
and
the
--
even
in
the
hertz
case,
there's
no
tax
for
a
year
after
1956
isn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
don't
have
the
question
--
the
issue
posed
by
mr.
justice
clark.
we
don't
have
this
year
and
that
is
before
us,
--
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
regulations
even
prospectively
where
asked.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
we
don't
actually
have
a
case
under
the
1956
regulations
suit,
none
of
these
cases
arose
under
--
it
was
a
case
to
which
the
1956
regulations
would
be
at.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
would
--
that
would
include
a
year
or
two
then
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
was
held
before
it's
here
in
the
hertz
case.
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
are
you
looking
at,
mr.
frazier?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
