justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bernhard,
i
assume
there
must
be
a
dollars
and
cents
difference
between
your
positions
here.
i
mean,
perhaps
you
can
help
me
understand
what
this
is
all
about
and
i
don't
understand
it
for
my
self.
can
you
take
an
illustration
of
the
automobile
which
cost
$2000
that
you
hold
for
year
and
dispose
of
for
$1000
and
tell
me
what
the
difference
tax
wise
is
between
you
and
the
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
he
takes
depreciation
on
the
basis
of
two
years.
in
your
illustration
how
much
does
that
mean
to
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
two-year
life?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wish
you'd
use
dollars
and
cents,
frankly
i
just
don't
get
it
the
way
you're
putting
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
you
dispose
of
it
at
the
end
of
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
--
on
your
hypothesis,
you
would
have
depreciated
the
asset
$95
a
year
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
times
five?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
$475,
there
would
be
$25
gain,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
sold
it
$500.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right,
now,
that's
on
your
approach
to
this
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
on
the
government's
approach?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
end
of
five
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
wipes
it
out
it
at
the
end
of
five
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let's
(inaudible)
always
of
the
application
of
the
government's
formula?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
this
be
the
consequence
always
of
the
application
of
the
government's
formula?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
just
figure
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
in
understatement.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
frazier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sometimes,
am
i
correct
that
--
that
salvage
value
maybe
greater
than
the
original
cost?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
as
your
--
your
own
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
too
hot
to
handle
because
of
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
recovery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
part
of
the
excess
of
recovery
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
and
that's
not
an
appealing
case
in
other
words.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
that
change
in
the
regulations
in
1942
is
reasonably
explainable
isn't
it,
by
a
statutory
amendment
in
that
year
allowing
depreciation
on
certain
on
business
product?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
capital
gains
with
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
year.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
heffron,
they
say,
as
you
say
a
--
a
dramatic
illustration
of
the
inequity
that
you
say
exists,
but
it's
--
and
perhaps
in
the
automobile
business,
it's
fairly
unusual,
but
it's
not
unheard
of
elsewhere
is
it?
i've
just
--
for
example,
in
--
in
business
real
estate,
real
estate
held
for
rent.
it's
depreciable
according
of
what
it's
made
of
and
when
it
was
built
and
so
on,
let's
say
50
years,
at
a
straight
line
depreciation
that's
2%
a
year.
but
it's
--
it's
quite
usual,
isn't
it,
in
these
kind
--
these
of
days
and
this
kind
of
economic
picture
for
you
--
for
a
--
for
an
owner
to
be
able
to
depreciate
that
from
cost
20%
or
30
%
and
then
actually
sell
it
at
a
profit
over
cost?
that's
not
unheard
of,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
year,
these
tax
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
was
--
is
precisely
hertz
argument
under
the
1954
code.
