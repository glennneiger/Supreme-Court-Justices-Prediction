mr.
william
r.
frazier
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
of
course,
have
--
have
the
opportunity
to
hear
the
rather
voluminous
arguments
of
my
predecessors
in
the
two
cases,
namely
evans
and
hertz.
and
i'm
very
much
interested
in
it
naturally.
i
will
attempt
not
to
be
repetitious
as
much
as
i
can.
frankly,
i
think,
the
issues
have
been
somewhat
unduly
clouded.
firstly,
i
would
like
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
first,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
make
this
comment.
apparently
for
some
reason
there,
my
client,
massey
motors,
has
gotten
too
hot
to
handle,
as
far
as
these
three
cases
can
--
are
concerned,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
your
honors
that
i
--
my
case
was
a
first
of
these
cases
won
by
a
taxpayer.
and
my
colleagues,
mr.
bernhard
here,
was
very,
very
willing
to
cite
my
case
both
in
the
hertz
case,
before
the
lower
court
and
it
was
--
and
it
was
commented
on,
with
approval,
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
i
have
other
of
these
cases
too,
your
honor,
which
they
also
cite
in
their
brief.
namely,
of
lynch-davidson
cases
which
are
now
on
appeal
before
us
--
fifth
circuit
and
davidson
versus
tomlinson.
to
be
in
with
your
honors,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
whole
point
involved
here
today,
is
as
much
a
pure
question
of
tax
law
as
can
be
brought
before
a
court.
you
can't
completely,
as
i
understand
it,
divorce
the
facts
from
the
lawsuit.
but
in
this
situation,
we
come
down
to
almost
a
pure
question
of
law.
and
i'll
try
to
state
it
once
again.
the
question,
as
i
understand
it,
is
for
the
purposes
of
depreciation.
what?
the
term,
“useful
life”
under
the
1939
code,
met
the
physical
or
economic
life
to
the
asset
as
we,
the
taxpayer,
contend
or
whether
as
the
government
contends,
it
is
the
useful
life
as
shown
by
the
particular
trade
practices
of
a
particular
individual
taxpayer.
now,
the
question
of
salvage
value,
of
course,
is
a
reciprocal
of
the
definition
of
useful
life.
it
follows
like
day
from
night
or
night
from
day.
once
you
determine
the
proper
legal
definition
of
the
term,
useful
life
for
purposes
of
depreciation
under
section
23
(l)
of
the
1939
code,
the
reciprocal
factor,
namely,
salvage
value,
will
follow.
and
i
mean
by
this,
if
the
court
should
agree
with
the
government
that
for
this
purpose,
the
term
useful
life
means
the
useful
life
in
the
taxpayer's
business
is
undisputed
that
in
the
massey
case,
our
actual
use
was
one
year.
that
your
honors
is
a
trade
practice
in
the
automobile
industry.
all
that
you
know,
from
your
own
common
knowledge,
that
automobile
dealers
keep
their
personnel
in
current
model
cars
and
if
that
the
manufacturers
change
these
models
approximately
once
each
12
months,
sometimes
a
little
more
frequently,
sometimes
less
frequently,
but
approximately
one
year.
in
this
rental
car
business,
it's
clear
that
they
do
likewise.
they
must,
as
a
matter
of
competition,
keep
their
units
that
they're
offering
for
rental,
new
cars.
they
gain
operating
advantages
by
way
of
expenses
that
way.
they
also,
as
a
matter
trade
practices,
make
higher
recoveries
on
the
resale
of
those
units.
and
it
has
become
almost
universal
practice
in
both
the
rental
car
business
as
well
as
the
new
car
sales
operation
to
use
these
cars
one
year.
now,
if
the
court
should
agree
with
the
government
that
that
useful
life
is
one
year,
then
we
lose
because
the
salvage
value
would
necessarily
have
to
be
the
amount
that
we
received
on
the
sale
of
the
units.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes,
your
honor.
and
--
and
my
situation
and
i
will
touch
on
that
briefly.
would
your
honor
like
me
to
comment
on
the
point?
mr.
william
r.
frazier
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court,
sees
fit
under
the
1939
code,
to
agree
with
us
that
useful
life
means
as
inherent
or
abstract
or
potential
useful
life,
then
it
would
seem
to
me,
on
this
record
that
we
are
--
that
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
and
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
use
an
estimated
useful
life
for
purposes
of
computing
straight-line
appreciation
of
three
years.
we,
of
course,
would
also
have
a
question
of
salvage
value
which
would
necessarily
cause
the
case
to
be
remanded
for
the
taking
of
testimonial
on
that
point.
and
that
arises
this
way,
your
honors,
i
think
the
history
of
this
thing
is
of
some
materiality
here.
my
case
is
a
fairly
early
one.
you
will
notice
from
the
plaintiff's
exhibit
5,
which
is
attached
to
the
record.
the
examining
agent
raise
this
point
on
us
in
april
of
1953,
rather
than
go
through
other
administrative
procedures
and
remedies,
we
elected
to
pay
this
tax,
forthwith,
file
the
claim
for
refund,
controverting
the
adjustment
of
the
agent.
and
in
due
course,
institute
in
our
suit
in
the
local
district
court,
seeking
an
adjudication
of
this
matter
by
way
of
refund
suit
as
opposed
to
litigation
before
the
tax
court,
as
was
done
in
the
evans
case.
the
hertz
case
went
--
as
ours
did
before
the
district
court
in
delaware.
now,
if
your
honors
would
examine
the
first
page
or
two,
of
the
plaintiff's
exhibit
5,
you
will
see
that
examining
agent
didn't
raise
any
issue
as
to
terms
of
estimated
useful
life
or
salvage
value,
because
that
wasn't
the
practice
of
the
treasury
then,
in
these
cases.
there
affair
was
that
inasmuch
as
we
are
admittedly
an
automobile
dealer,
namely,
operating
under
a
franchise
from
chrysler
corporation,
in
the
jacksonville
the
florida
area
and
incidentally
one
of
the
largest
dodge
and
plymouth
dealers
in
the
country.
since
we
were
in
that
business,
that
these
company
cars
remained
at
all
time,
stock
in
trade
that
they
never
changed
their
character
to
that
of
a
depreciable
asset
and
hence,
we
were
subject,
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
know
depreciation
and
hence,
the
depreciation
claim
was
disallowed
in
toto.
and
our
capital
gain
claims
under
section
117
(j),
were
reversed
to
that
of
ordinary
income.
and
that,
your
honors,
was
the
practice.
i
have
a
number
of
these
cases.
one
of
them
that
i
had
was
for
a
corporation
known
as
duval
motor
company,
which
is
a
ford
dealer
in
the
jacksonville
area,
which
we
elected
to
take
the
tax
court.
in
that
case,
they
used
a
four-year
estimated
useful
life,
with
no
salvage
value
and
the
case
went
up
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not,
these
cars
were
held
primarily
for
sale
or
primarily
for
use
in
the
business.
if
they
were
held
primarily
for
use
in
the
business,
they
would
qualify
for
capital
gains
treatment
under
section
117
(j)
upheld
in
service
for
six
or
more,
under
its
expressed
terms.
if
they
were
inventory
property
or
property
held
primarily
for
sale,
then
the
school
is
out,
so
to
speak
for
us,
we
didn't
qualify
for
section
117
(j).
and
from
the
facts,
the
tax
court
concluded
that
the
automobiles
in
question,
were
held
primarily
for
sale
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
case.
had
the
tax
court
held
the
units,
held
primarily
for
use
in
the
business,
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
our
depreciation
as
claimed,
because
that
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
the
first
of
these
cases
that
arose
was
the
w.
r.
stevens
buick
company
case
which
i
think
was
decided
in
approximately
1951.
there,
a
buick
company,
having
these
executive
company
cars,
claimed
depreciation
on
them
in
capital
gains
treatment,
it
was
disallowed.
namely,
the
capital
gains
element
was
disallowed,
on
the
same
theory,
namely,
stock
in
trade.
they
went
to
the
tax
court.
the
tax
court
agreed
with
the
commissioner's
determination
and
they
took
an
appeal,
i
think,
to
the
fourth
circuit,
wherein
a
split
decision
--
the
decision
the
tax
court
was
affirmed.
interestingly
enough,
for
the
next
years,
the
same
corporation
elected
to
pay
the
tax
and
went
up
through
their
own
local
united
states
district
court,
where
a
contrary
finding
was
made
and
they
received
the
capital
gains
treatment
and
the
government
took
no
appeal.
the
next
of
these
cases
was
(inaudible)
chevrolet
corporation,
which
is
the
same
as
our
case
and
they
--
accept
it
was
chevrolet
dealership
in
knoxville,
tennessee.
there,
the
tax
court
interestingly
enough,
following
its
prior
decision
in
the
--
in
the
stevens
buick
case,
held
that
the
cars
were,
in
fact,
held
primarily
for
use
of
the
business
and
the
depreciation
claimed
a
four-year
straight-line
with
no
salvage
value,
was
automatically
allowed.
now,
i
point
this
out
to
your
honors,
to
show
and
i
think
almost
conclusively
demonstrate
that
this
is
in
the
nature
of
an
afterthought.
this
argument
is
the
--
with
which
we
are
being
presented
here
today.
i'll
tell
your
honors,
frankly.
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
proper
for
this
argument
to
be
made
in
our
case,
because
it
had
never,
as
far
as
i
knew,
up
to
the
point
that
the
record
was
closed
in
the
district
court
that
we
had
any
such
issue.
the
--
the
case
was
tried
on
the
theory
that
it
was
a
(inaudible)
case
namely,
one
of
these
cars
were
held
primarily
for
use
in
the
business
or
whether
they
were
inventory
property.
if
used
for
business,
we
got
our
depreciation
because
they
had
been
no
disallowance
of
our
three
useful
life.
they
didn't
say
we
should
use
four
or
five.
they
didn't
say
it
was
one
year.
they
simply
disallowed
the
depreciation
in
toto
on
the
theory
that
it
was
stock
in
trade.
now,
as
far
as
rental
business
is
concerned,
philber
equipment
company
is
a
leading
decision
in
this
field,
is
on
the
same
footing.
there,
the
question
was
simply
whether
the
rental
cars
were
held
primarily
for
sales,
sets
business
practice
showed
that
they
were
sold
after
approximately
one
year
of
use.
and
there,
the
third
circuit
reversed
judge
ron's
decision
from
the
tax
court
and
held
the
taxpayer
was
primarily
holding
those
units
for
rental
and
hence,
was
entitled
to
capital
gains
treatment.
now,
the
same
argument
is
being
made
here
today.
it
could
have
been
made
in
the
philber
equipment
case,
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
the
philber
case
arose
earlier
than
these
present
cases
and
hence,
this
afterthought
had
not
been
dreamed
up
at
that
point.
now,
your
honors
--
specifically
now,
with
respect
to
the
resale
price
of
these
automobiles.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
taxable
years
involved
in
my
case
for
the
calendar
years
1950
and
1951,
bearing
in
mind
also,
that
my
client
is
an
automobile
dealer
franchised
by
chrysler.
hence,
the
units
in
question
are
purchased
at
factory
list
prices
and,
of
course,
are
carried
in
to
our
depreciation
schedules
at
that
cost,
which
may
run
as
much
as
20%
to
25%
less
than
the
--
than
the
normal
retail
price
for
the
cars.
in
addition
to
that,
if
your
honors
recall,
the
korean
war
was
in
progress
at
that
time
and
is
common
knowledge
that
economic
conditions
caused
the
automobile
business
to
improve
greatly,
because
the
supply
of
cars
was
diminished
and
the
demand
accelerated
very
similar
to
the
years
immediately
following
world
war
ii.
hence,
we
had
a
ready
market
for
the
cars
and
that,
of
course,
is
true
in
evans
too,
they
can't
deny
it.
their
cars
were
sold
at
slightly
less
than
cost,
but
percentagewise,
it's
very
small.
our
cars
in
the
aggregate,
for
the
two
years
in
question,
were
sold
for
slightly
in
excess
operational
cost
without
regard
to
the
depreciation.
and
we
say,
your
honors,
several
things
in
that
connection.
one
is
--
as
--
a
point
was
made
in
the
record
in
this
case
below
that
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried,
that
was
not
the
situation.
that
economic
condition
had
changed
in
the
point
that
they
were
not
recovering
that
full
cost
at
all.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
it,
your
honors,
that
as
far
as
we
know,
price
fluctuations
are
not
to
be
considered
for
purposes
of
depreciation.
for
example,
we
know
of
no
authority,
which
--
which
would
prevent
a
taxpayer
from
depreciating
a
building,
for
example,
which
happened
to
have
been
bought
during
the
depression
which
today
is
worth
many
times
its
original
cost.
as
we
understand
it,
the
depreciation
that's
properly
chargeable
it's
--
if
it's
a
25-year
useful
life,
continues,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
market
value
of
the
particular
asset
maybe
great
in
excess
of
its
cost.
depreciation,
after
all,
is
-
is
basically
a
--
an
accounting
concept,
a
bookkeeping
entry,
if
you
will,
where
original
capital
cost
are
recovered
over
the
estimated
useful
life
of
the
asset.
now,
we
readily
admit,
your
honors,
that
this
creates
a
rather
peculiar
economic
situation
with
respect
to
our
case
for
the
years
1950
and
1951.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
whole
law
or
practice
or
administrative
procedure,
if
you
will,
of
the
treasury
for
40
years
which
has
been
discussed
previously,
should
be
upset,
just
because
i
have
a
rather
peculiar
case
here
today,
going
out
of
the
fact
that
my
client
is
an
automobile
dealer
and
gets
these
cars
at
somewhat
lesser
cost
and
the
fact
that
we
were
in
the
korean
sellers
market
insofar
as
automobile
dealers
were
concerned.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
your
honor,
that
[laughs]
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
is
rather
elusive
point.
i
would
say
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
--
out
or
rather
elusive
matter.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
i
would
say
in
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes.[laughter]
mr.
william
r.
frazier
well,
your
honor,
i
would
answer
the
question
this
way.
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
evans
case
will
state
that
to
your
honor
and
more
expertly
than
i
ever
could,
because
that
--
that
was
a
unanimous
decision
and
in
that
case,
the
court
enumerated
from
the
facts
and
record
before
it,
that
practice
and
came
to
that
conclusion.
and
it
did
so,
based
on
primarily
on
one
thing
and
that's
what
i
want
to
discuss,
because
i
think
in
the
prior
argument,
this
has
been
greatly
confused.
the
--
as
i
understand
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
which
we
are
urging
the
court
to
adopt
as
its
own
here
in
derogation
of
our
own
fifth
circuit
split
decision
in
my
case
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
--
i
think,
in
reading
the
ninth
circuit
case,
that
they
were
relied
principally
on
the
treasury
regulations.
and
i
want
to
state
this
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
i
think
there's
been
some
confusion
as
to
what
regulations
we're
talking
about.
to
begin
with,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
my
case
is
more
nearly
a
kin
to
the
evans
case
than
the
hertz
case,
because
as
your
honors
know,
both
the
evans
and
my
case
arose
under
the
1939
code
and
the
regulations
issued
there
that
the
hertz
case
arose
under
the
1954
code
and
the
1954
regulations
issued
in
1956.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
oh,
they
--
they
do,
your
honor.
i
--
i
[laughter]
--
much
too
hard
to
handle,
but
i
think
in
the
final
analysis,
your
honors
will
see
that
we're
on
identical
footing.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
i
see,
well
i'm
sorry,
now
[laughs]
mr.
william
r.
frazier
being
an
automobile
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
that's
right,
your
honor.
to
that
extent
i'm
on
somewhat
weaker
grounds
in
the
--
to
all
these.
but
--
but
basically,
the
legal
point
is
identical
in
all
these
cases.
now,
your
honors,
with
respect
to
these
regulations
as
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
the
evans
case,
that
went
into
great
detail
to
point
out
that
the
regulations
--
number
one,
that
section
23
(l)
is
very
broad.
it
simply
provides,
by
its
terms,
that
in
computing
that
income,
there
shall
be
allowed
a
reasonable
allowance
for
job
exhaustion,
wear
and
tear,
including
a
reasonable
allowance
for
--
of
obsolescence.
now,
your
honors,
that
is
very,
very
general.
it
really
doesn't
tell
you
much.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
or
--
that
is
the
statute
under
which
we
--
these
--
these
evans
and
hertz
--
or
rather
evans
and
my
case,
fall
section
23
(l)
of
the
1939
code.
that
doesn't
even
use
the
word
depreciation
as
i
read
it.
now,
that,
of
course,
statute
is
intended
to
permit
the
depreciation
allowance
obviously
and
is
certainly
is
a
classic
example
of
a
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
law,
under
which
the
commissioner,
under
the
inherent
powers
provide
section
3791
of
the
1939
code,
was
entitled
to
issue
regulations.
that
is
regulations
which
would
more
make
the
statute
workable
and
more
specific
and
we
think,
your
honors,
that
those
regulations
issued
under
this
section
of
the
law
have
the
full
force
and
effect
of
law.
if
there
ever
was
a
treasury
regulation
which
should
be
given
that
interpretation,
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
massey
versus
commissioner
and
helvering
v.
the
r.
j.
reynolds
tobacco
company,
we
think
that
the
regulations
issued
under
this
section
are
of
that
character.
now,
the
regulations
as
it
pointed
out
by
the
ninth
circuit
which
were
issued
in
1919
and
they
were
treasury
regulations
45,
dealing
with
this
subject,
are
the
ones
with
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
i
--
we
have
alluded
to
them,
your
honor.
and
they're
more
specifically
set
forth
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
it
was
in
that
--
and
those
treasury
regulations,
your
honor,
remained
in
full
force
and
effect
until
1942.
now,
in
treasury
regulations
45,
with
respect
to
depreciation,
may
refer
to
the
useful
life
of
property
in
the
business.
and
your
honors
will
recall
that
mr.
heffron
has
cited
those
regulations
as
his
administrative
authority
in
support
of
his
position.
and
they
do
admittedly
use
the
term,
useful
life
in
the
business.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
i
emphasize
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
--
it
for
this
reason,
your
honor,
that
in
1942,
treasury
regulations
111
were
issued
replacing
or
repealing,
if
you
will,
treasury
regulations
45.
and
those
regulations
which
were
in
effect
until
the
adoption
of
the
1954
code
regulations
dropped
the
phrase,
“useful
life
in
the
business,”
and
instead
defined
it,
as
the
“useful
life
of
the
asset”.
now,
that
phrase
is
inherent
in
these
regulations
which
were
in
full
force
and
effect
during
the
taxable
years
involved
in
both
the
evans
case
and
the
hertz
case.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
i
construe
it,
your
honor,
at
--
as
--
as
was
expressly
stated
by
the
judges
of
the
ninth
circuit,
they
construe
that
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
i
would
do
it
this
way.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
that
those
--
that
the
phrase,
“useful
life
in
the
business,”
refers
to
the
inherent
very
economic
and
useful
life
of
these
assets.
useful
life
in
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
judges
construe
that
to
mean
simply
referring
to
the
class
of
assets,
namely,
depreciable
assets
which
is
a
reasonable
construction
to
place
on
this
matter.
but
at
least
the
regulations
under
which
you
could
come
to
this
rather
tenuous
conclusion
were
not
in
a
--
force
and
effect,
during
the
tax
years
involved
in
this
case
of
the
evans
case.
now,
i
thought
at
that
point,
perhaps
had
not
been
strong
enough
brought
to
your
honors
attention.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
that,
your
honor,
was
the
conclusion
of
judge
tuttle
in
the
opinion
of
this
circuit.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
he
--
he
--
it
was
necessary
to
--
to
make
some
such
remark
as
that
because
there
was
an
actual
change.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
that's
right
your
honor
and
he
refers
to
--
that
is
judge
tuttle,
refers
to
a
--
a
legislative
history
of
the
regulations.
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
don't
really
understand
what
he
is
referring
to
because
we
don't
know
of
any
legislative
history
regulations
and
we
--
we
conclude
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
--
that
part
of
the
commission
--
excuse
me.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes,
you
are.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes.
property
used
in
the
production
of
income.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
and
yes,
they
--
well,
that
property
of
the
change,
we
don't
know.
but
it's
our
position
that
as
a
taxpayer,
bear
in
mind
that
these
regulations
is
supposed
to
be
read
and
understood
by
a
layman,
businessmen,
as
well
as
lawyers
and
accountants
and
judges
for
that
matter.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
they,
we
contend,
that
the
treasury
either
advertently
or
inadvertently,
by
amending
those
regulations
in
1942,
gave
us
the
support
for
our
construction
of
the
term,
“useful
life”.
it
would
mean
just
like
congress
writes
a
law
which
gave
us
that
right.
maybe
they
did
it
inadvertently.
but
if
it's
there
and
clear,
then
we're
entitled
to
it
until
it
changed.
and
that
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
well,
that
is
--
of
course,
is
the
point.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
no,
i
--
i
agree,
your
honor.
in
fact
that,
of
course,
is
the
crux
of
the
case.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
as
we
say
it.
and
of
course,
we
are
--
urge
the
adoption
of
the
ninth
circuit's
in
view
of
this
matter,
as
opposed
to
the
view
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
sixth,
which
incidentally,
the
sixth
circuit
as
i
read
it
in
the
hertz
case,
was
largely
influenced
by
the
decision
of
our
case
in
the
massive
situation.
i
would
like
to
suggest,
your
honors,
that
along
this
line
as
to
treasury
regulations
and
their
validity
and
--
and
effectiveness
on
this
problem,
what's
having
assumed
that
the
treasury
have
the
right
to
issue
these
regulations
and
that
they
are
valid,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
have
the
right
in
1956
to
amend
them
again.
and
that's
where
i
have
difficulty
in
seeing
how
you
can
make
the
same
argument
for
a
case
arising
under
the
1954
code,
on
these
identical
facts,
as
you
can
under
the
1939
code.
it
seemed
to
me,
the
commissioner
under
the
1954
regulations
has
with
great
particularity,
specified
that
he
is
now
construing
the
term,
“useful
life,”
first
--
the
first
time
defining
incidentally,
as
the
useful
life
in
a
particular
taxpayer
trade
of
business,
and
the
salvage
value
equals
the
amount
that
he
is
reasonably
calculated
to
recover.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes,
sir.
and
course
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
and
as
your
honor
knows,
the
district
court
in
the
hertz
case
and
i
think
properly
so,
construe
those
regulations
as
operating
prospectively
only
since
they
were
such
a
radical
departure
from
law,
if
you
assume
they
have
the
four
full
force
and
effect
of
law,
which
certainly
they
were.
that
could
have
--
those
regulations
could
have
just
as
well,
been
written
in
the
statute,
by
congress,
because
of
that's
specific
and
complete.
and
we
think
they
--
they
are,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
equivalent
from
the
statute
itself.
and
therefore,
there
might
be
a
difference,
a
--
a
logical
difference
in
deciding
the
evans
and
the
massey
case
one
way
and
the
cases
arising
on
the
1954
code,
another.
i
don't
urge
that,
but
i
think
it
would
be
some
logic
and
basis
for
it.
just
a
few
comments
your
honors,
because
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may?
mr.
william
r.
frazier
this
matter
before
your
honors
today,
even
though
my
case
is
a
small
tax
wise
involves
not
too
much
money,
it's
mostly
a
matter
of
principle,
has
very
far
reaching
implications
as
a
matter
of
policy,
if
you
will.
the
--
by
adopting
the
government's
theory,
the
court
will
be
injecting
the
subjective
test,
if
you
will,
for
purposes
of
computing
depreciation
on
ad
hoc
method,
an
every
man
for
himself
method.
now,
that's
going
to
--
that's
going
to
probably
result
in
more
loss
of
revenue
than
they're
going
to
pick
up
out
of
this
rental
car
companies
and
my
company,
and
related
companies.
because
the
taxpayers
will
now
be
able
to
gain
accelerated
depreciation
on
a
grand
scale
by
taking
assets
which
normally,
under
the
old
concept,
carried
a
10-year
useful
life
and
actually
putting
him
into
service
for
five
years
and
charging
them
off
in
five
years.
of
course,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
bar
at
least
a
portion
of
the
years
on
reexamination
as
far
as
salvage
values
is
concerned
and
the
--
unless
the
congress
changes
section
1231,
which
is
the
present
counterpart
of
section
117
(j).
there
will
be
long-term
capital
gain
treatment
realized.
conversely,
it
can
work
against
the
taxpayer.
he
may,
just
as
well,
take
an
asset
that
would
carry
a
10-year
useful
life
and
everyone
agrees
that
it
did.
but
as
a
matter
of
trade
practice
or
business
judgment
or
necessity,
he
might
sell
that
machine
in
five
years.
well,
of
course,
he
would
report
any
gain
or
loss
on
that
as
the
difference
between
his
cost
and
the
depreciation
he'd
taken
on
a
10%
basis,
if
it
were
straight
line.
the
treasury,
they
say,
“oh,
no.
you
can't
do
that
because
the
useful
life
of
five
years,
and
even
though
you
can't
get
a
tax
benefit
for
some
of
this,
you've
got
to
reduce
that
cost
as
if
it
they'd
been
set
up
on
a
20%
basis
and
hence,
your
capital
gain
is
much
larger.”
so,
it
will
--
it
will
add
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
bickering
and
we
think,
it
is
a
matter
which
should
be
properly
disposed
off
after
due
consideration
by
the
congress,
rather
than
having
the
--
the
government
seek
to
get
a
retroactive
adjudication,
which
will
hit
taxpayers
out
of
the
blue,
if
you
will,
your
honors,
by
--
by
court
decision.
and
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
we
honestly
urge
your
honors
to
see,
if
it
all
possible,
whether
you
can
adopt
as
the
--
as
the
disposition
on
this
matter
of
the
theory
and
rational,
but
what
i
think
is
excellently
recent
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
i
think,
the
equally
well-reasoned
decision
of
the
lower
court,
that
is
the
trial
court,
in
the
hertz
case,
wherein
he
held
that
under
the
--
the
judge
held,
that
under
the
1939
code,
we
would
be
correct.
if
our
case
had
come
before
him,
he
would
have
held
for
us,
for
holding
that.
the
regulations
on
the
--
that
four
code
being
valid,
could
operated
from
their
date
of
promulgation.
thank
you.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
i
now
would
like
to
take
just
a
few
more
moments
of
rebuttal,
if
your
honors
please.
first,
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
our
brief
that
we
file,
we
have
re
produced
the
relevant
portions
of
the
treasury
regulations,
which
we
claimed
governed
this
matter
before
the
court,
issued
under
section
23
(l)
of
the
1939
code.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
this
for
possible
consideration
of
the
court.
the
first
place,
the
government
today,
of
course,
is
looking
back
some
10
years
on
what
was
done
by
my
taxpayers
and
i
would
like,
if
your
honor
would
(inaudible)
time,
think
(inaudible)
regulations
and
read
them
casually
and
then
project
yourself
into
the
position
of
my
client
and
his
auditor,
with
respect
to
this
matter
before
the
court.
he's
got
regulations
--
mr.
william
r.
frazier
page
38.
mr.
william
r.
frazier
firstly,
under
regulation
(inaudible)
(l)-1,
you
would
find
this.
the
proper
allowance
for
such
depreciation
in
that
amount
which
should
be
set
aside
for
the
taxable
year
in
accordance
with
the
reason
of
the
consistent
plan,
not
necessarily
a
uniformed
rate,
whereby
the
aggregate
of
the
amount
so
set
aside,
plus
the
salvage
value,
will
at
the
end
of
the
useful
life
of
the
depreciable
property,
equal
to
cost.
now,
that
phrase,
“the
useful
life
for
the
property,”
appears
again
in
that
portion
of
that
regulation,
section
4,
which
is
reproduced
on
the
page
39,
reading
the
capitals
own
brief
to
be
replaced
by
depreciation
allowance,
is
the
cost
for
all
the
basis
of
the
property
in
respect
of
which
the
allowance
is
made.
then
further
in
section
5,
the
deduction
for
depreciation
in
respect
to
any
of
depreciable
property
for
any
taxable
year
shall
be
limited
to
such
ratable
amount
is
--
may
reason
it
be
necessary
to
recover
during
the
remaining
--
remaining
useful
life
of
the
property,
the
unrecovered
cost.
take
that
if
you
will,
together
with
both
of
them.
and
i
think
it's
at
page
45,
that
bulletin,
which
specifically
refers
to
automobiles
and
tells
(inaudible)
that
out
of
the
general
guide,
as
the
published
policy
of
the
treasury
department,
acting
through
his
bureau
then,
bureau
of
internal
revenue,
that
if
you
have
passenger
cars,
five
years,
salesmen
cost
three
years.
so
my
company
elected
to
use
the
three
year,
except
for
what
in
that
bulletin
have.
now,
that
was
the
situation
in
which
they
found
themselves
and
we
think
they
were
entitled
three.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
been
a
pleasure
and
i
hope
to
return
again
further
time.
thank
you,
sir.
hope
to
return
again.
