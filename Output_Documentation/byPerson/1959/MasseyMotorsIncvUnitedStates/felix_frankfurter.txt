what's
the
four-year
basis
for
depreciation
derived
from?
justice

frankfurter
(inaudible)
his
average
is
derived
from
the
life
use
of
car
and
mine?
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
dealing
cars
with?
justice
felix
frankfurter
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean,
passed
on
by
--
by
the
paper
company,
that's
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
what
you
say
an
abstraction
or
a
model;
this
is
a
tax
model,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
economists
call
model.
this
is
a
model
to
be
applied
to
an
individual
although
he,
himself,
the
fact
of
his
case
do
not
fit
the
model,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
argument
that
you
are
combating,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
say
it
right
away,
say
it
right
away,
do
you
contend
there
is
no
such
practice
or
that
if
there
is,
it's
to
be
disregarded
which,
don't
argue
that,
i
just
want
to
know
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it
called?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
heffron,
if
our
--
we
will
understand
the
practicality
a
little
better
if
you
tell
me
when
bulletin
“f”
was
first
promulgated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whenever
that
was,
what
was
--
how
are
the
--
how
are
these
situations
dealt
before
there
was
a
bulletin
“f”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
thinking
of
the
taxpayer,
i'm
thinking
of
my
own
understanding.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
part
of
the
treasury
go
about
or
what
were
the
rules
for
the
taxpayer
before
there
was
this
generalization,
these
categories,
these
classes
as
bulletin
“f”
provided?
did
each
--
was
each
taxpayer
pay
on
his
own
that
he
had
to
make
the
determination,
what
were
the
treasury
policy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
phrase
useful
life,
is
that
in
a
statute
or
treasury
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
--
can
i
accurately
rephrase
the
contention
between
you
two
that
your
conception
of
useful
life
is
potential
life
and
there's
enjoyed
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
useful
life
for
you
is
potential
life
and
for
them
is
enjoyed
life?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
tell
us
--
will
you
tell
us
whether
as
a
matter
of
treasury
practice
involving
situations
like
evans,
what
actually
has
been
the
dollar
and
cents
application
of
what
you
just
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
been
your
way
or
mr.
bernhard's
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
established
this
40
year
practice,
for
which
you
just
eluded
that's
more
conclusively
than
it
has
enough
to
this
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
elusive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
most
interesting
adjective,
i've
heard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
fixed
on
what
is
called
a
40-year
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
the
--
the
construction
be
put
upon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
they
may
not
have
realized
that
they
would
thereby
the
stirring
sympathy
for
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
he's
determining
whether
they
gave
it
--
gave
by
inadvertent,
may
not
be
just
or
unjust
if
those
words
maybe
used
for
reference
to
tax
matters
though
i
believe,
most
inapplicable
to
any
form
of
sanitation.
may
not
--
the
consideration
of
the
consequences
be
relevant
in
the
construction
of
a
regulation
as
much
so
as
in
the
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
emphasize
the
taxes
may
have
by
inadvertence,
maybe
it
wasn't
done
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
words
maybe
susceptible
of
the
old
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you're
not
imprisoned
in
the
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
crux,
indeed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
do
with
the
new
dealer
whose
had
no
experience
as
to
whom
there
has
been
no
experience.
