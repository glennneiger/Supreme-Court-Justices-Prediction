mr.
edgar
bernhard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
from
the
time
allotted
i
hope
to
explore
three
areas
in
very
brief
fashion
of
course.
the
first
the
peculiar
paradox
in
which
the
government
finds
itself
as
a
result
of
this
attempt
to
change
the
long
established
definitions
of
useful
life
and
salvage
value,
a
paradox
resulting
from
the
fact
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
and
counsel's
argument
this
afternoon
are
completely
irreconcilable
with
something
which
counsel
did
not
mention,
40
years
of
consistent
administration
of
depreciation
law.
second,
the
repeated
attempts
made
by
the
government
to
get
congress
to
bring
about
the
result
which
the
government
is
now
asking
this
court
to
bring
about
in
a
different
method,
in
different
way
entirely
by
the
redefinition
of
useful
life
and
a
salvage
value,
all
which
attempts
were
rejected
by
the
congress.
third,
the
very
great
risks
the
government
is
taking
in
connection
with
areas
of
the
depreciation
field
which
are
not
even
before
the
court
and
that
suggests
and
which
maybe
radically
affected
if
the
government
succeeds
in
all
returning
these
long
accepted,
recognized,
approved
principles
of
depreciation
in
this
fashion.
now,
before
beginning
on
the
first
of
those,
i
do
want
to
say
preliminarily
that
the
third
case
of
these
three
old
cases,
the
massey
case
is
not
in
our
opinion
a
companion
case.
we
are
not
interested
in
the
third
case.
we
do
not
represent
the
taxpayer
in
the
third
case
and
we
consider
it
a
case
completely
different
from
evans
and
hertz.
evans
and
hertz,
however,
stand
on
the
same
bottom
although
there
is
a
difference
which
we'll
develop
when
we
get
into
the
hertz
case,
a
technical
difference.
i
also
would
like
to
make
sure
that
counsel
has
not
inadvertently
misled
the
court
in
describing
the
length
of
time
over
which
the
taxpayer,
both
in
evans
and
in
hertz
and
all
taxpayers
for
many
long
years
back
of
this
take
depreciation.
the
depreciation
deduction
is
of
course
actually
taken,
the
dollar
depreciation
deduction
is
of
course
actually
taken
only
for
the
number
of
years
we
retained
the
assets,
the
depreciable
assets,
but
at
the
rate
--
the
rate
of
depreciation
at
--
the
rate
at
which
we
depreciate
the
assets
is
the
total
useful
life.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
it
appeared
for
the
first
time,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
a
statute
in
the
1954
code
without
definition.
and
we
say
of
course
that
the
government
can
hardly
deny
it
seems
to
us
that
when
congress
took
the
phrase
“useful
life”
it
actually
took
it
from
the
regulations.
and
when
it
took
the
phrase
useful
life
and
used
it
in
the
1954
code
for
the
first
time
in
any
statute
without
defining
it,
it
surely
took
it
with
whatever
definitions
and
understandings
had
attached
themselves
to
that
phrase,
long
before
over
this
40-year
period
and
that
is
what
i'd
like
to
describe,
that
definition
of
useful
life
and
how
it
was
built
up.
but
two
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right
--
that's
right,
sir.
however,
the
real
point
is
that
the
government
is
trying
to
carry
back
even
to
this
evans
case
which
arises
under
the
1939
code,
the
same
concepts,
the
same
definitions
of
useful
life
and
salvage
value
which
--
which
appeared
for
the
first
time
which
began
so
far
as
the
government
was
concerned
with
its
1956
regulations,
it
is
really
trying
to
carry
back
the
concepts
in
the
1956
regulations
and
now
first
this
paradox,
which
the
government
presents
to
this
court.
the
government
is
now
contending
for
adoption
of
--
its
definition
of
useful
life
as
the
taxpayer's
holding
period
and
its
definition
of
salvage
value
as
the
value
of
the
asset
whenever
it
is
sold,
that
is
the
price
obtained
for
it,
not
the
value
at
the
expiration
of
the
full
useful
life.
and
to
hear
counsel,
it
would
seem
that
there
really
never
was
any
other
accepted
idea
about
useful
life.
and
just
to
make
sure
that
we
understand
each
other
about
useful
life
and
salvage
value
and
their
connection,
may
i
say
this
that
really
the
issue,
the
solid
issue,
the
important
issue
between
the
government
and
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
and
in
the
--
the
hertz
case
is
whether
the
useful
life
of
the
taxpayer's
automobiles
is
the
whole
physical
life.
the
inherent
functional
life
for
general
business
purposes
as
the
taxpayer
contends
or
the
period
during
which
the
automobiles
are
held
by
the
taxpayer
in
a
given
case
by
the
given
taxpayer
as
the
government
contends.
and
the
reason
i
say,
that's
really
the
solid
issue
between
us
is
that
the
salvage
value
issue
which
of
course
is
very
important
grows
out
of
the
useful
life
issue.
if
the
--
and
--
and
the
resolution
of
the
useful
life
issue
will
automatically
resolve
what
is
salvage
value
because
the
parties
agree
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
that
salvage
value
is
the
residue
after
useful
life.
now,
if
the
useful
life
is
the
whole
useful
life,
the
whole
physical
life
of
the
asset,
then,
salvage
value
is
the
residue
junk
salvage
value
left
at
the
end
of
the
full
useful
life.
if
the
useful
life,
if
the
proper
definition
of
useful
life
is
as
the
government
contends
the
holding
period,
then
salvage
value
is
the
value
at
the
end
of
that
period,
the
end
of
“useful
life”
defined
that
way
and
it
is
of
course
greater
in
value
then
than
the
salvage
value
at
the
end
of
the
full
physical
life,
the
taxpayer's
definition.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
i
beg
your
pardon.
is
what
life?
mr.
edgar
bernhard
as
the
measure
of
useful
life
which
--
from
which
we
ascertain
the
rate
of
the
depreciation,
not
the
amount
and
not
the
length
of
time
we
actually
take
depreciation,
yes
your
honor.
in
our
briefs,
we
asked
the
government
to
give
us
a
single
case
in
the
whole
history
of
depreciation
legislation
and
litigation
prior
to
this
court
litigation
now
before
this
court
in
which
at
every
contended
for
it.
now,
we
didn't
say
establish
because
it
is
clearly
never
done
that,
but
a
single
case
in
which
he
have
had
contended
for
the
definitions
for
which
it
now
contends
in
this
case
and
in
the
hertz
case.
not
a
single
such
instance
has
been
cited.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
included
in
our
briefs
cases
decided
by
the
board
of
tax
appeals
by
the
tax
court,
by
district
courts,
by
the
court
of
appeal
just
to
--
one
or
two
of
which
i
want
to
go
into
here
in
a
moment
in
which
the
commissioner
was
not
just
silent
about
what
is
useful
life
and
what
is
salvage
value,
but
in
which
he
contended
for
three-year
and
four-year
and
five-year
and
six-year
lives
for
automobiles
which
he
knew
had
been
sold
when
he
made
that
contention
after
two
years
or
after
one
year
or
after
seven
months.
in
all
those
cases,
the
commissioner
was
contending
that
the
rate
of
depreciation
to
be
applied
was
the
rate
established
on
the
basis
of
the
full
physical
life
of
the
asset,
if
it
was
four
years
for
automobiles
and
there
is
no
other
testimony
in
either,
evans
or
hertz
that
it
is
anything
else,
four
years
for
automobiles
and
the
rate
of
depreciation
said
the
government
in
those
cases
was
25%.
they
said
that
i
say,
knowing
that
the
automobiles
had
already
been
sold
after
a
much
shorter
period.
now,
just
to
take
a
specific
example;
charlie
hillard,
31
tax
court
961
decided
in
1959.
hillard
was
in
the
rental
car
business.
he
held
his
cars
for
--
from
seven
months
to
one
year.
what
was
the
government's
position?
the
government
contended
that
the
useful
life
of
those
automobiles
was
four
years.
it
referred
to
the
automobiles
as
being
used
by
the
taxpayer
“for
one-fourth
of
their
useful
lives
and
then
sold.”
the
government
was
there
trying
to
show,
since
after
the
1954
code
and
after
the
1956
regulations,
but
the
government
was
they're
trying
to
show
that
hillard
was
a
dealer
and
it
fitted
best
with
that
argument
to
show
that
useful
life
was
the
whole
useful
life,
four
years.
in
the
early
depreciation
cases
before
the
tax
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that
case
was
decided
in
1959.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
in
the
much
earlier
cases
in
1926,
1927,
1929
before
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
the
government
was
contending
for
a
useful
life
for
automobiles
of
four
years
or
five
years
despite
holding
periods
of
two-and-a-half
years
and
three
years.
it
was
taking
the
same
position,
our
position
in
this
case
and
in
the
hertz
case,
in
1942,
before
the
board
of
tax
appeal
in
1956
in
the
third
circuit
and
even
in
1959
in
the
tax
court.
but
one
of
the
most
interesting
examples
to
illustrate
how
completely
the
government
has
about
to
face
is
pen
versus
commissioner,
199
f.2d.
210,
a
case
decided
in
1952.
a
rent
tenant
erected
a
building
at
her
own
expense.
she
proceeded
to
take
depreciation
on
it
at
a
rate
based
on
her
holding
period
i.e.
here
life
expectancy.
the
commission
--
the
commissioner
referred
to
that
idea
of
taking
depreciation
over
a
useful
life
defined
by
the
holding
period
as
“a
novel
contention”
and
said
there
was
no
basis
for
computing
annual
deductions
for
depreciation
on
the
basis
of
the
period
of
use
by
that
taxpayer
“rather
than
on
a
basis
of
the
useful
life
of
the
property
itself.”
mr.
edgar
bernhard
the
property
was
a
building,
your
honor.
and
then
the
commissioner
went
on
his
brief
in
that
case
to
point
out
what
he
called,
“the
basic
fallacy
in
taxpayer's
argument.”
now,
taxpayer's
argument,
i
must
remind
the
court,
is
the
very
argument
which
the
government
makes
these
briefs
in
this
case
and
in
the
hertz
case
and
which
counsel
makes
this
afternoon.
“the
basic
fallacy
in
that
argument”
said
the
government,
“was
in
that
taxpayer's
assumption
that
the
measure
of
the
period
of
depreciation
was
something
other
than
the
life
of
property
itself
and
that
the
taxpayer
was
disregarding”
as
indeed,
the
government
now
disregards,
was
disregarding
the
fact
that
depreciation
is
a
matter
of
wear
and
tear
of
property.
and
finally,
the
government's
brief
in
that
case
actually
said,
“on
taxpayer's
theory,
every
owner
of
the
depreciable
interest
in
property
would
be
entitled
to
deduct
annual
depreciation
at
a
rate
based
on
a
number
of
years
he
expects
to
enjoyed
in,
expect
to
live,
and
enjoy
the
income
from
the
property
instead
of
the
number
of
years
the
property
may
be
expected
to
produce
income.”
and
in
its
brief
in
that
case,
the
government
actually
refers
to
the
taxpayer's
theory,
the
holding
period
theory
the
court
just
heard
about
from
the
counsel
as
leading
to
“a
result
repugnant
to
the
fundamental
concepts
of
depreciation”
and
i
must
agree
completely
with
the
government
in
that
case.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
because
your
honor
in
that
case,
the
holding
period
of
that
building
was
the
taxpayer's
life
expectancy
and
the
government
completely
inconsistently
with
its
attempts
in
this
case,
with
its
attempted
redefinitions
in
this
case,
held
that
the
holding
period
was
not
to
be
taken
as
the
measure
of
useful
life,
but
the
potential
value
of
the
building
was
to
be
taken
as
the
useful
life.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor,
but
--
but
over
the
whole
period
of
the
physical
life
of
that
building,
that
would
be,
in
other
words,
if
that
building
was
50
years
which
is
a
standard
period
of
useful
life
for
a
building
and
if
that
useful
life
for
50
years
or
that
physical
life
of
the
building
were
50
years,
the
taxpayer
said
the
government
in
that
case,
“must
take
depreciation
at
2%.”
mr.
edgar
bernhard
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
that
was
the
contention
of
the
government
in
that
case
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
that
now,
today,
and
in
its
brief
in
evans,
and
in
its
brief
in
hertz,
the
government
is
contending
as
if
in
that
pen
case
it
had
said
of
course
you
have
to
take
the
period
during
which
the
taxpayer
holds
the
property
not
the
period
of
the
whole
useful
life.
i'm
saying
that
if
the
position
is
entirely
inconsistent
and
your
honor
is
quite
correct,
i'm
sure
that
the
problem,
length,
the
proper
useful
life
definition
is
the
whole
physical
life
of
the
property.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
no,
your
honor.
may
i
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
may
i
--
i
perfectly
have
made
myself
clear
and
i
--
i
certainly
would
like
to.
we
--
i
think
what
has
misled
your
honor
is
the
reference
to
four
years
for
automobiles
and
it
is
true
that
it
is
prescribed
in
bulletin
“f”
by
the
government
as
the
useful
life
of
automobiles.
it
is
true
also
that
the
testimony
in
evans
and
in
hertz,
both
was
that
the
useful
life,
the
full
physical
life
of
automobiles
is
four
years.
if
we
hold
the
automobiles
for
one
year
or
two
years
or
three
years,
we
actually
deduct
depreciation
from
cost
only
of
course
for
the
length
of
time
we
hold
it,
but
at
the
rate
--
at
the
rate
established
by
the
whole
physical
life
of
the
asset,
and
if
the
whole
physical
life
of
the
asset
is
four
years,
then
we
deduct
depreciation
during
the
period
we
continue
to
use
the
automobiles
at
25%
per
year.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
your
honor,
i
have
to
ask
whether
you
are
presuming,
mr.
justice
black,
whether
you're
presuming
excessive
use
or
holding.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
well,
take
automobiles
for
instance.
i
think
i
can
make
it
very
clear,
i
hope
i
can,
take
automobiles.
if
i
operate
my
automobiles
16
hours
a
day,
instead
of
eight
let's
say,
or
24
hours
a
day,
in
a
taxi
cab
doesn't,
three
chauffeurs
operating
the
automobiles,
that
excessive
use
is
wear
and
tear
and
that
excessive
wear
and
tear
will
reduce
useful
life,
the
whole
physical
life
of
the
asset,
it's
true.
and
the
four-year
period
assumes
normal
use,
normal
repair
policy,
maintenance
policy
such
as
--
it
was
testified
to
were
followed
in
evans
and
in
hertz.
and
if
your
honor
is
saying,
if
in
excess
business,
he
operates
machines
or
automobiles
or
any
depreciable
assets
at
excessive
use
and
therefore
the
useful
life
is
only
two
years
let's
say,
it
is
true
then
that
that
is
the
rate
that
--
that
would
be
established.
that
would
establish
the
rate
at
which
you
take
depreciation.
if
it
were
two
years,
the
rate
would
be
50%.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
no.
i
do
think
that
inadvertently
counsel
--
perhaps
gave
you
your
honor
the
idea
that
we
take
depreciation.
that
is
we
actually
deduct
depreciation
over
a
four-year
period,
even
if
we
only
hold
the
cars
for
two
or
three.
that
we
do
not
do.
we
take
depreciation,
actually
deduct
depreciation
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
we
--
we
do
not.
we
take
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
but
in
a
different
way
because
we
do
not
get
more
depreciation
that
we're
entitled
to
for
more
than
is
reflected
by
wear
and
tear
because
that
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
sorry.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
is
not
contended
for
here.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that
is
not
contended.
we
operate
our
cars
on
the
normal
basis.
we
operate
our
cars
with
normal
repair
and
maintenance
and
that
brings
us
within
the
normal
rule,
the
four-year
rule.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
all
--
we
don't
suffer
four
years
of
depreciation.
i
don't
want
to
be
giving
your
honor
that
impression.
we
don't
suffer
four
years
of
depreciation,
but
if
we
hold
the
car
for
two
years,
we
suffered
two
years
of
depreciation
and
that
is
the
length
of
time
during
which
we
deduct
depreciation
at
a
25%
rate,
at
a
25%
rate.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
well,
your
honor,
whether
we
suffer
or
not.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor,
whether
we
suffered
or
not.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
an
automobile
--
i
think
we're
talking
about
straight
line
depreciation
now.
a
depreciable
asset
is
purchased
let's
say
for
$1000.
it
has
a
10-year
useful
life.
it
is
--
therefore,
the
rate
of
depreciation
to
be
taken
is
10%.
now,
it
is
agreed
that
under
straight
line,
salvage
value
shall
first
be
deducted.
and
let's
say
that
salvage
value
is
$50
at
the
end
of
the
useful
life
would
be
$50.
that
is
to
make
its
salvage
value
as
first
deducted
and
$950
is
then
the
adjusted
basis
which
is
to
be
depreciated
at
the
rate
of
10%
per
year.
and
if
the
owner
continues
to
hold
it
according
to
the
counsel
for
the
government,
for
only
two
years,
he
takes
depreciation
on
the
basis
of
two
years.
on
our
basis
that
the
way
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
on
the
basis
of
a
two-year
life.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
we
held
it
for
five
years
let's
say
which
is
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
all
right,
your
honor.
on
our
contention,
the
$950
would
mean
deduction
of
depreciation
at
the
rate
of
$95
per
year
and
we
would
take
$95
for
the
first
year
and
$95
for
the
second
year
and
as
for
many
years
as
we
continue
to
use
the
asset.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
at
the
end
of
five
years,
we
would
no
longer
be
deducting
depreciation
and
--
and
if
it
were
sold
at
the
end
of
five
years
for
$500,
the
difference
between
the
$500
and
the
amount
to
which
we
had
depreciated
the
asset
would
be
taken
as
a
capital
gain.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right
–
mr.
edgar
bernhard
right.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
and
we
would
have
depreciated
that
at
$475.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
the
$475
would
be
deducted
from
$100
--
from
$1000,
i'm
sorry,
it
will
be
deducted
from
$1000
and
the
adjusted
basis
would
be
the
difference
i.e.
$525.
if
we
sold
it
for
$600,
we
would
take
$75
as
the
capital
gain.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
the
government's
approach
--
the
government's
approach
results
in
elimination
of
any
possibility
for
capital
gain
if
salvage
value
is
properly
estimated
at
all.
the
government
says
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
using
the
same
figures.
the
government
says,
$1000
--
$1000
asset
which
you
estimate,
you
are
going
to
hold
for
five
years
means
that
you
can
take
a
20%
per
year
deduction
and
therefore,
you
can
take
20%
of
$950
each
year
while
you
hold
it.
the
deduction
of
salvage
value
however,
changes
the
$950
figure.
it
is
no
longer
$950
figure
for
the
government
because
the
government
starts
with
$1000,
says
you
estimate
not
only
your
holding
period,
but
the
salvage
value
i.e.
the
price
you're
going
to
get
for
the
asset
and
if
you
estimate
that
you
are
going
to
get
$500
for
the
asset
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
at
the
end
of
five
years,
you
take
the
$500
from
$1000
before
you
begin
depreciation.
so,
that
although
you
are
entitled
to
20%
depreciation
per
year,
you
take
it
on
$500.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor
and
therefore,
when
you
sell,
no
capital
gain
because
it
balances
of
course.
the
undepreciated
balance
or
adjusted
basis
will
always
equal,
the
price
you
get.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
except,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
--
a
misestimate.
in
the
case
of
--
an
estimate
of
a
different
amount
of
sale
price
obtainable
there
might
be
a
difference
and
one
of
our
contentions
is
in
fact,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that
there
is
a
--
a
reward
for
one
who
underestimates
your
salvage
value
whereas
a
taxpayer
who
correctly
estimates
his
salvage
value
is
going
to
have
no
capital
gain.
now,
the
--
it's
--
the
government
puts
its
argument
always
whether
it
is
arguing
for
holding
period
as
it
is
in
evans
and
hertz,
or
arguing
for
full
useful
life
which
is
the
four-year
definition
of
useful
life
and
always
puts
its
arguments
in
terms
of
the
fundamental
concept
of
depreciation.
in
pen,
it
was
insisting
that
the
fundamental
concepts
of
depreciation
required
retention
of
this
long
established
definition
of
useful
life
as
the
full
physical
life
of
the
property.
and
now,
in
evans,
it
refers
again
although
it
is
now
saying
it
isn't
the
full
physical
life
which
determines
the
rate
of
depreciation,
it's
only
the
period
in
which
you
hold
it.
it
is
now
again
saying
the
--
this
is
in
keeping
with
the
fundamental
concepts
of
depreciation,
on
one
occasion
of
this
spoke
of
the
settled
concept
of
depreciation,
but
this
time
it's
the
holding
period
that's
for
--
that's
the
settled
concept.
as
to
the
second
area
of
discussion,
the
repeated
efforts
of
the
treasury
department
to
convince
the
congress
that
it
should
make
the
changes
which
would
lead
to
the
same
result
for
which
it's
--
asking
this
court.
at
least
one
of
us
appealing
to
congress,
the
treasury
was
in
the
right
form.
it
made
four
attempts,
futile
attempts,
to
get
the
congress
to
make
changes
which
would
result
in
the
result
that
asking
for
here.
the
first
of
those
was
in
1947
at
eight
for
the
house
ways
and
means
committee.
the
government
asked
congress
to
reduce
the
effect
of
the
capital
gain
section
by
treating
gains
realized
on
the
sale
of
partially
depreciated
assets
as
ordinary
income.
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out
below,
the
treasury
department
in
reports
to
the
house
committee
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
revenue
loss
resolving
from
the
taking
of
capital
gains
on
the
sale
of
depreciable
assets,
but
the
congress
took
no
action.
the
second
attempt
was
in
1950.
the
treasury
pointed
out
to
congress
that
gains
on
the
sale
of
depreciable
assets
are
treated
as
capital
gains,
but
that
if
the
taxpayer
takes
a
lost,
he
can
treat
it
as
an
ordinary
lost
against
ordinary
income
and
asked
congress
to
change
that
so
that
it
would
not
be
as
they
said
a
one
way
street
but
that
the
loss
would
be
a
capital
loss
only,
the
congress
refused
to
do
so.
when
the
third
attempt
was
made,
it
was
made
in
the
courts
in
the
filbert
case
in
1956,
third
circuit
case,
and
also
at
first
in
this
evans'
case
by
attempting
the
elimination
of
--
of
--
or
at
least
drastic
reduction
of
capital
gains
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
automobiles
used
in
renting
and
leasing.
not
having
succeeded
with
congress,
it
tried
the
courts,
but
the
court
in
filbert
would
not
permit
them
to
maintain
as
they
tried
to
do
in
evans'
also
that
the
taxpayer
in
a
renting
and
leasing
business
was
a
dealer
in
automobiles
and
therefore
could
not
take
depreciation
at
all
and
the
attack
was
abandoned
by
the
government
in
the
evans'
case.
