justice
william
o.
douglas
how
--
how
old
was
he
about
this?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
what
year
was
this?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
talking
about
the
labor
management
act
as
it
was
at
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
heard
argument
in
this
case
or
as
of
now?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
rely
on
the
--
the
disclosure
requirements
in
the
federal
act?
justice
william
o.
douglas
under
the
--
under
the
federal
disclosure
act,
would
this
man
be
disqualified?
justice
william
o.
douglas
by
--
by
reason
of
what
fact?
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
has
this
man
--
any
criminal
record
since
1920?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
must
assume
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
that
there
is
none.
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
the
act
that
he
was
convicted
of
related
at
all
to
waterfront
activities?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
--
first
time
that
the
conflict
--
alleged
conflict
with
the
1959
act
is
raised,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
don't
have
here
a
case
for
preemption
for
the
first
time
is
raised
here.
preemption
has
been
raised
all
along.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it's
a
different
argument
in
the
support
of
it
is
now
rendered
by
reason
of
that
1959
statute.
is
that
correct?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
issue
pre-emption
was.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
read
it,
it
saves
the
--
the
rights
of
members.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
isn't
cast
in
terms
of
saving
rights
of
states
to
--
to
legislate
--
in
terms
of
race.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
--
i
missed
the
process
of
reasoning
by
which
you
got
out
of
the
word,
“responsibilities”
in
603
(a)
of
the
1959
act,
disabilities
of
a
--
of
a
person
to
hold
office
in
the
union.
it
says
responsibilities
of
a
labor
organization.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
doesn't
say
rights
of
a
labor
organization,
says
responsibility.
it
doesn't
say
disabilities
of
an
officer
or
agent,
it
says
responsibility.
