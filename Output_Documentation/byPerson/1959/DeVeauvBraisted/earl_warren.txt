mr.

chief

was
the
crime
itself
when
it
would
disqualify
under
the
federal
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
don't
--
they
didn't
have
--
he
wasn't
charged
with
the
crime
of
joyriding
as
--
as
they
have
in
some
states.
it
was
--
it
was
attempted
grand
larceny.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
language
you
have
read
is
in
the
compact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sullivan,
what
--
what
have
you
to
say
to
the
argument
that
mr.
gleason
to
the
effect
that
in
order
to
achieve
this
merger
of
these
four
unions
that
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
have
an
interim
organization
until
sometime
in
the
latter
part
of
--
of
this
year
which
interim
organization
contemplated
that
the
officers
of
each
of
these
unions
would
--
would
remain
as
officers
of
the
new
organization
until
they
had
an
election
in
the
latter
part
of
this
--
this
year
for
single
officers
of
the
--
of
the
new
union.
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
i
misunderstood
you
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
was
--
when
was
this
merger
affected?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
we
don't
have
any
record.
do
you
--
if
you
want
to
--
to
have
it
declared
moot
you
must
have
a
record
here
must
you
not
to
show
the
mootness
of
it.
you
can't
just
bring
in
one
--
one
document,
one
part
of
this
organization
and
put
it
in
the
record
and
say
that
shows
mootness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
because
of
your
compact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
referred
to
in
--
in
any
of
the
reports
of
the
committees
of
congress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
--
by
union
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
reports
of
the
committees
that
indicates
at
the
--
that
they
acted
upon
it
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sullivan
before
we
get
to
that
while
we're
still
on
the
--
on
the
compact
what
have
you
to
say
about
the
restricted
language
that
mr.
gleason
read
us
from
the
compact
just
--
just
short
while
ago?
would
it
--
that
language
seem
to
rather
broad
and
--
and
it
seem
to
me
it
would
call
for
some
discretion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
well,
the
reservations
which
they
said
that
this
was
not
to
interfere
with
collective
bargaining
and
the
selection
of
their
--
selection
of
their
own
officers
and
things
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
is
that?
where
is
that
to
be
found?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
have
that?

justice

we
see
that
--
let's
see.
i
don't
find
that
--
well
it
seems
to
have
the
--
i
don't
seem
to
have
the
reply
brief,
but
it's
all
right.
what
--
what
do
you
have
to
say
to
that
language
mr.
sullivan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
if
they
selected
a
certain
class
of
individuals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
said
in
the
compact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
they
want
mr.
brown
and
doesn't
that
interfere
with
their
right
to
select
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
do
you
mean
that
he
can
act
for
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
suppose
--
suppose
they
select
as
one
of
their
officers
someone
to
collect
the
dues
aren't
they
interfering,
wouldn't
this
law
interfere
with
their
--
their
right
to
--
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
where
--
and
--
and
wouldn't
that
interfere
with
their
right
of
organization?
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
right
to
collect
dues
a
rather
important
part
of
a
--
of
labor
organization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
that's
a
--
that's
a
federal
government.
the
federal
government
is
occupying
that
field
and
it
can
say
what
it
wants.
the
federal
government
can
say
--
say
that
they
can't
collect
money
if
they
--
if
they
want
i
suppose
as
they've
done
in
this
--
in
this
most
recent
act
in
1959.
they've
laid
down
some
--
some
regulations
somewhat
similar
to
this,
but
the
question
is
whether
with
these
restrictions
that
are
in
the
compact
and
with
the
provisions
of
the
labor
--
labor
laws
themselves
to
the
effect
that
they
may
have
then
restrained
right
of
--
of
organizing
whether
that
preempts
the
situation
and
deprives
new
york
of
the
right
to
--
to
vet
then
with
them.
that's
the
only
thing
i
have
in
my
--
in
my
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
--
didn't
this
bear
on
it?
doesn't
this
bear
on
it
--
this
compact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
would
have
left
the
compact
that's
why
i
want
to
bring
it
back
to
it
to
--
for
that
--
to
my
--
my
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sullivan,
a
little
a
while
ago,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
state
was
merely
exercising
its
police
powers.
i
wonder
in
--
in
the
absence
of
this
compact,
if
it
--
is
there
any
state
that
didn't
have
a
compact
of
this
kind?
if
it
could
enact
a
law
such
as
you
--
such
as
you're
sustaining
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
then
it's
your
position
that
--
that
the
--
the
compact
didn't
create
any
additional
rights.
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
you
have
it
--
had
the
rights
already
and
that
there
was
no
pre-emption
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
federal
government
through
the
labor
management
relations
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
unless
they
put
that
into
every
section,
there
is
--
there
is
no
pre-emption?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gleason.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
is
that
to
be
found?
chief
justice
earl
warren
new
york
state
document
70?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
