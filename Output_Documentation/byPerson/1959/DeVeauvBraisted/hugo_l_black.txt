l.
black
did
you
mention
the
hill
case
before
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
mention
it
at
any
--
at
any
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
of
appeals,
didn't
mention,
i
see
in
their
original
opinion,
did
they
read
an
opinion
on

l.
black
page
what,

justice

l.
black
22.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
question
raised
there
as
to
preemption
raised
has
to
conflict
with
the
old
act
or
the
act
which
is
in
effect
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think

do
you
think
that
the

could
be
decided
without
--
by
ignoring
the
fact
that
there
is
a
statute
now
which
does
--
let's
assume
preempt
the
field?
can
it
be
decided
on
--
on
the
basis
of
your

l.
black
but
the
question
of
preemption
is
a
question
that's
involved.

black
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
have
to
go
back
to
section

of
the
old
act?
i
should
suppose
that
the
law
of
the
state
was
governed
by
the
â€“
it's
validity
at
the
time
the
matter
is
being
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
maybe
--
maybe
the
courts
held
differently
in
the
case
then,
i
do
not
know
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
in
the
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
quoted?
justice
hugo
l.

is
only
a
part
of
it.
