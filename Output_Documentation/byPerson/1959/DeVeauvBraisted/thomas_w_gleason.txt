mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
was
a
declaratory
judgment.
it
was
instituted
by
the
appellant
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
section
8
for
the
waterfront
commission
act.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
very
brief.
de
veau,
some
40
years
ago
in
1920
while
a
youth,
went
joyriding
in
an
automobile
valued
at
$700.
he
was
apprehended
by
the
police
and
later
on
he
pleaded
guilty
to
attempted
grand
larceny.
he
received
a
suspended
sentence
and
was
placed
on
probation
for
five
years.
in
19
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
he
was
19
years
of
age
at
the
time.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
in
1920.
in
1926,
he
went
to
work
on
the
waterfront
and
worked
there
until
1949
when
he
was
elected
secretary-treasurer
of
the
local
1346
in
the
port
new
york
which
is
affiliated
with
the
international
longshoremen's
association.
that
election
was
held
by
the
(inaudible)
association.
in
1953,
the
state
of
new
york
legislated
section
8,
which
prevented
anyone
who
is
convicted
of
a
felony
to
be
a
union
officer.
in
1953,
after
the
statute
was
legislated,
the
de
veau
commenced
an
action
in
the
southern
district
court
of
new
york
to
test
the
constitutionality.
at
that
time,
the
waterfront
commission
and
the
district
attorneys
of
new
york
put
the
position
that
it
did
not
apply
to
de
veau.
and
sometime
after
that,
the
case
of
calabrese
and
hazelton
was
commenced
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
there,
the
constitutionality
of
section
8
was
upheld
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
--
within
the
police
power
of
the
state.
in
1955,
before
the
decision
of
hazelton
versus
murray,
de
veau
again
ran
for
office
and
was
elected
by
the
membership
who
knew
of
his
past
felony
and
this
election
was
also
conducted
by
the
(inaudible)
association.
the
compact
was
divided
into
three
parts.
part
one,
does
not
contain
section
8.
it
sets
up
the
recommendations
made
to
congress
and
which
the
congress
passed
on.
section
8,
is
contained
at
part
three,
in
which
congress
did
not
pass
on
and
therefore
did
not
ratify
section
8.
we
take
the
position
that
section
8
is
in
conflict
with
section
7,
in
that
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
pre-empts
the
states
from
taking
any
action
as
to
setting
up
qualifications.
we
base
this
on
a
hill
versus
florida
case
in
which
the
court
there
ruled
as
i
state
may
not
set
up
qualifications
as
to
union
officers
or
representatives
of
unions
which
employees
have
the
right
to
free
choice.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
this
--
well,
it
was
--
as
it
was
at
that
time.
since
that
time,
the
government,
congress
has
passed
the
labor
management
disclosure
act
which
now
sets
up
qualifications.
that
was
passed
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
(inaudible).
in
fact
i
think,
it
was
after
--
it
was
passed
after
we
submitted
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
we
do
to
this
extent
that
it
further
justifies
and
shows
that
congress
there
set
up
qualifications
and
they
specifically
spelled
out
but
they
still
maintain
a
right
of
the
representatives
to
have
free
choice,
it's
tremendous
do
give
them
their
free
choice
to
choose
representatives
of
their
own
choosing.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no
sir.
he
would
not.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
well,
the
fact
is
that
it's
been
40
years
since
he
was
convicted
of
a
crime
and
there
the
qualification
said
five
years,
either
of
conviction
or
five
years
at
the
--
he's
sentenced.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
he
was
convicted
of
attempted
grand
larceny,
the
access
grand
larceny.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
considered
grand
larceny.
he
was
convicted.
he
pleaded
guilty
at
the
time
and
received
a
suspended
sentence.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
that's
correct
sir
and
they
didn't
have
the
youth
felony
act
at
that
time
in
new
york
in
which
i
believe
they
have
now
in
new
york
and
it
wouldn't
be
consider
as
a
felony
in
new
york.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir.
hazelton
versus
murray
was
decided
on
the
police
power
of
the
state.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
and
there
--
there
i
think
you
based
your
decision
on
the
decisions
of
the
staten
island
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
that's
correct
sir.
the
only
reason
why
i
think
the
hazelton
versus
murray
case
is
--
is
brought
into
the
phrase
is
the
fact
that
new
jersey
has
the
same
statute
which
--
which
sets
up
only
they
say
high
misdemeanors
over
the
--
and
--
and
jersey
and
the
fact
is
that
there
is
some
question
at
section
8.
the
preemption
was
raised
in
the
hazelton
versus
murray
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir.
we
take
the
position
also
that
the
hill
versus
florida
case
explicitly
set
up
rules
so
that
there
would
be
uniformity
of
--
of
qualifications
for
union
officers.
if
there
was
to
be
any
action
taken,
it
was
to
be
taken
by
congress
as
the
have
done
under
the
labor
management
disclosure
act.
under
the
--
under
section
8,
section
8
does
not
only
take
in
representatives
of
new
york,
but
takes
in
every
union
official
from
maine
to
texas.
this
was
borne
out
in
the
hogan
case
of
ila
in
which
joseph
schilt
at
that
time
was
an
official
of
the
international
and
he
had
to
relinquish
that
office.
few
days
after
decision,
hogan
died
of
course
so
he
had
a
heart
attack
and
so
we
couldn't
go
up
on
that
case,
but
the
issue
is
that
they
have
taken
the
position
that
no
matter
where
the
felony
was
committed
and
no
matter
where
the
official
comes
from
as
long
as
he
is
in
new
york,
he
cannot
hold
office.
now,
the
international
office
of
the
ila
is
in
new
york.
so
it
becomes
broad.
it
--
it
actually
extends
its
power
into
these
areas
and
to
these
other
states.
the
law
specifically
spells
out
that
any
felony
of
any
state
and
we
know
there
are
some
felonies
in
some
states
which
are
against
public
policy
in
new
york
namely
the
crime
of
(inaudible)
and
which
would
be
a
hardship.
the
international
is
made
up
of
50%
of
colored
and
50%
of
white.
so
therefore,
that
would
be
a
going
beyond
the
state's
rights
and
going
into
other
areas.
we
also
believe
that
this
court
has
definitely
set
up
in
its
decision
in
the
san
diego
case
and
stated
the
law
that
to
have
any
qualifications
set
up
by
any
states
would
definitely
do
away
with
the
intent
of
congress.
we
also
take
the
position,
that
section
8
is
a
violation
of
a
due
process
clause
in
that
it
deprives
appellant
of
his
right
to
work.
section
8
is
automatic.
there
is
no
right
to
hearing,
no
right
to
notice.
it
specifically
spells
out
that
if
a
man
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
committed
40
years
ago
or
even
100
years
ago,
he
cannot
hold
the
union
office.
it
does
not
set
up
any
qualifications
and
it
does
not
take
any
consideration
of
whether
the
crime
was
committed
as
a
union
official
or
had
any
reference
to
as
union
office.
the
--
stately,
the
due
process
clause
--
due
process
clause
includes
the
right
to
pursue
an
occupation
and
this
court
has
so
held.
we
take
the
position
that
the
law
is
an
ex
post
facto
and
also
a
bill
of
attainment
in
that
is
an
additional
punishment
without
trial.
the
man
had
no
right
to
hearing
and
the
only
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
punish
and
to
deter
others.
there
was
no
other
purpose
in
the
statute
and
we
feel
as
if
for
these
reasons
that
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir.
i
mean
a
occupation.
his
right
to
pursue
an
occupation
of
being
a
union
official,
he
is
denied
that
right,
for
a
crime
was
committed
many
years
ago.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
but
in
new
york,
they
have
the
--
you
have
the
right
of
a
hearing
and
i
believe
in
new
york,
you
have
the
right
even
though
you
are
convicted
of
a
felony
to
be
a
lawyer.
here,
there
is
no
hearing,
no
notice,
no
nothing.
it's
an
automatic
disbarment
from
holding
office.
it
goes
back
to
the
time
that
the
man
had
actually
committed
his
crime
40
years
ago.
it
doesn't
go
into
the
future.
it
only
goes
into
the
past.
it
goes
future
as
past
actually.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
well,
the
state
has
the
right
as
long
as
it
doesn't
conflict
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
a
man
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
to
justify
his
position
especially,
when
it
goes
back
to
past
crimes.
to
me,
it's
the
same
position
as
passing
a
law
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
he
could
not
hold
office
more
than
twice.
it
takes
effect
for
everybody
in
the
future,
but
nobody
–
it
didn't
take
effect
as
far
as
mr.
truman
was
concerned.
he
had
a
right
to
continue
to
run
for
office
again,
but
this
goes
back
40
years
and
since
a
man
who
is
now
employed
as
a
union
official
and
was
elected
by
the
membership
who
knew
of
his
crime
and
was
conducted
in
an
(inaudible)
association,
an
election.
he
is
denied
his
right
automatically.
there's
no
trial,
no
hearing
and
nothing,
you
just
disqualify.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
five
years.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
under
the
new
law,
it
is
four
years.
the
issue
raised
by
the
--
by
the
appellee
was
that
the
police
powers
of
the
state
demanded
this
and
we
respectfully
like
to
read
from
the
articles
--
article
1
finding
in
declarations
of
the
waterfront
commission
compact
which
was
set
forth
before
congress.
section
4
says,
“the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
hereby
find
and
declare
the
occupations
of
longshoreman,
stevedores,
pier
superintendent,
hiring
agents
and
port
watchman
are
affected
with
the
public
interest
requiring
their
regulation
and
such
regulation
shall
be
deemed
and
exercised
by
the
police
power
of
the
two
states
for
the
protection
of
the
public
safety,
welfare,
prosperity,
health,
peace
and
living
conditions
of
the
people
of
the
state
--
of
the
two
states.”
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
says
anything
about
union
officials.
in
fact,
all
through
the
hearings,
congressional
hearings,
there
was
no
mention
of
regulating
union
officials
or
union
officers.
the
only
mention
was
a
--
a
statement
submitted
by
the
ila
attorney
at
that
time
a
prepared
statement
which
said
that
there
was
–
it
would
be
a
conflict
with
section
7
and
the
hill
case.
this
was
before
the
committee,
congressional
committee.
it
was
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress.
it
was
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
senate.
in
fact,
during
the
state
crime
hearings,
there
was
no
recommendation
that
there
should
be
a
regulation
of
union
officials.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir.
that
was
specifically
to
spell
out
the
rules
and
regulations
to
be
--
to
be
employed
for
longshoremen
hiring
centers
and
the
rule
set
up
for
watchmen
and
for
stevedores.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
in
that
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
that
--
that
was
done
separately
and
had
no
part
of
part
one.
in
fact
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes,
but
only
in
furtherance
of
the
occupations
specifically
spelled
out
in
the
findings
and
declarations.
in
fact,
i
--
i
ran
through
the
legislation
of
a
federal
government
and
a
state
government
and
there
was
no
mention
anywhere
of
section
8.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
which
was
specifically
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
they
put
in
article
15,
they
have
a
limitation.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir
which
is
part
one
and
subdivision
2,
there
says
“this
compact
is
not
designed
and
shall
not
be
construed
to
limit
in
any
way
the
rights
of
longshoreman
hiring
agents,
pier
superintendents
or
port
--
port
watchmen
or
their
employers
to
bargain
collectively
and
agree
among
any
method
for
this
election
of
such
employees
by
way
of
seniority
experience,
regular
gangs
or
otherwise
and
they
specifically
spell
out
there,
that
they
shall
have
the
right
to
free
choice
and
i
think
we
--
we
answer
that
question
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
and
subdivision
1,
specifically
spells
that
out
and
says
“this
compact
is
not
design
and
shall
not
be
construed
to
limit
in
any
way,
any
rights
granted
for
the
right
from
any
other
statute
or
any
rule
of
law
for
employees
to
organize
in
labor
organizations,
to
bargain
collectively
and
to
act
in
any
way
individually,
collectively
and
through
labor
organizations
or
other
representatives
of
their
own
choosing
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
--
without
limiting
the
generality
of
a
point
going
nothing
contained
on
this
compact
shall
be
construed
to
limit
in
any
way
the
right
of
employees
to
strike.
so
they
have
a
safeguard
spelled
out
in
article
--
at
part
one,
article
15
protecting
these
rights
and
that
came
about
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir
and
that
language
came
about
during
the
state
hearings
whereby
there
was
some
objections
raised
by
the
unions
that
the
state
was
infringing
upon
the
--
the
rights
of
labor
and
they
specifically
put
that
in.
i
think
we
spell
that
out
in
a
reply
brief.
one
of
the
issues
raised
on
a
motion
by
the
appellee
was
the
fact
of
mootness.
sometime
in
1957,
the
local
1346
was
--
which
was
one
of
four
checkers
locals
in
a
port
merged
into
local
1,
into
one
local.
there,
they
agreed
that
all
the
officers
of
each
local
would
come
in
and
hold
office
until
1960.
they
would
have
the
same
jurisdiction
and
have
the
same
area
and
de
veau
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
he
is
now
as
he
was
then.
his
jurisdiction
in
staten
island,
the
crime
is
the
collection
of
dues
which
would
take
place
in
staten
island
and
therefore,
he
is
exactly
in
the
same
position.
i
can't
see,
in
no
sense,
where
the
question
is
moot.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes
sir,
we
raised
the
hill
case
from
the
supreme
court,
special
time
we
raised
it
in
the
appellate
division
and
we
raised
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
i
think
the
only
place
that
i
think
it
was
mentioned
was
the
appellate
division.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
there
was
no
rehearing.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
local
1346
as
such
is
not
in
existence.
they
all
merged
into
local
1,
but
all
the
officers
and
the
members
of
1346
became
part
of
local
1.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
by
agreement.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
that's
right,
but
this
was
--
the
membership
had
passed
on
the
merger.
they
had
voted
for
the
merger
and
this
--
the
officers
of
the
local
1346
are
still
officers
of
the
local
1
and
1960
of
the
--
at
the
termination
of
office,
they
will
hold
a
new
election
whereby
then
instead
of
having
four
secretary-treasuries
where
they
now
have
for
each
local,
they
will
have
one
secretary-treasurer.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
instead
of
having
so
many
vice
presidents,
they
will
cut
it
down
but
in
order
to
effectuate
this
merger,
what
they
done
was
take
the
officers
and
--
and
put
them
into
this
local
until
the
termination
of
their
terms.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
oh
it's
done
by
contract
of
the
parties
which
was
ratified
and
passed
by
the
membership.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
1346.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
the
only
thing
that
local
1346
now
has
is
a
--
an
account
in
staten
island
which
they
still
maintain
in
staten
island
until
the
finalization
in
october
or
november
of
this
year
of
the
local
1
and
--
and
that
time
the
bank
account
will
be
put
into
the
local
1.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no,
not
until
november,
because
he
was
elected
in
1955
as
secretary-treasurer
of
1346,
so
therefore,
he
automatically
became
a
secretary-treasurer
of
local
1
and
that
office
is
still
vacant
pending
the
determination
of
--
of
this
action.
i
might
say
that
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
no
matter
what
happens
here,
the
de
veau
is
still
in
the
same
position
because
we
must
decide
whether
or
not
he
has
the
right
to
run
for
office
in
november.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
reply
brief.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
i
just
like
to
bring
out
a
couple
of
points
here
your
honor.
first
of
all,
de
veau
is
not
automatically
disbarred
from
holding
a
checker's
license.
the
law
of
the
waterfront
commission
specifically
spells
out
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
they
placed
a
five-year
probation
period
in
there
and
a
five-year
disqualification
of
the
felony.
so
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
in
their
discretion,
they
can't
grant
him
a
license
to
be
a
checker.
it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
all
the
--
all
the
occupations
spelled
out
under
the
findings
and
the
declarations
namely
longshoremen,
hiring
agents,
watchmen
and
stevedores
they're
all
provisions
for
hearings
and
provisions
for
notice.
they
have
a
right
to
appeal
to
the
courts
if
they're
not
satisfied
with
the
determination
of
the
waterfront
commission.
section
8
goes
much
further.
it
gives
them
no
right
of
hearing,
no
right
to
bring
in
witnesses,
no
right
to
show
that
he
has
over
the
years
became
--
become
a
citizen
of
good
character.
it's
not
based
on
character.
it's
based
mainly
for
the
purpose
of
punishment
and
for
the
purpose
to
be
(inaudible)
there's
no
other
reason
for
this
section
8.
i'd
like
to
point
out
also
that
we
still
maintain
that
congress
has
given
no
--
had
given
no
consideration
of
section
8,
the
only
place
that
it
was
brought
up
was
in
a
committee
hearing.
congress
wasn't
aware
of
section
8,
and
the
only
--
even
--
even
in
the
state
hearings
and
the
recommendations
before
the
state
legislature,
there
was
no
recommendation
that
they
should
take
any
action
against
unions.in
fact
they
took
the
opposite
view.
they
took
the
position
that
congress
should
be
consulted
and
that
there
were
revisions
coming
up
before
the
tart-hartley
--
under
tart-hartley
law,
and
that
therefore
they
should
present
these
changes
to
congress.
and
they
specifically
spell
out
the
conflict.
and
that
can
be
found
in
the
4th
report
of
new
york,
the
state
crime
commission
and
there
is
nowhere
at
all
where
congress
have
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no,
sir.
we
--
it
was
raised
that
we
only
have
one
day
to
--
to
get
a
reply
brief
and
then
the
printed
(inaudible)
couldn't
do
it
for
us.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
in
the
4th
report
of
the
new
york
state
crime
commission.
that's
the
new
york
state
legislature
document
number
70,
1953.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes,
1953.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes,
sir.
but
the
recommendations
were
never
presented
to
congress
about
section
8
or
anything
to
do
with
unions.
this
was
something
where
--
was
made
by
somebody
in
the
legislature
of
new
york.
there
was
no
recommendation
to
congress.
congress
wasn't
even
informed.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
mr.
waldman
had
a
prepared
statement
in
which
he
presented
only
to
a
committee
hearing.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
he
mentioned
that
there
would
be
a
conflict
that
there
was
a
law
pending.
and
if
i
remembered
correctly,
i
think
he
points
out
in
there
that
they
--
they
didn't
know
about
it
until
about
two
or
three
days
before
the
bill
was
being
presented
and
passed.
there
was
no
knowledge
on
anybody's
part
that
there
was
such
a
bill
in
the
legislature.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
well,
i've
arranged
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
and
i
think
he
--
that
was
the
only
place
was
any
committee
hearing,
where
it
was
split
out
in
a
prepared
statement,
there's
no
other
place.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
--
i
think
in
a
state
--
in
the
state
hearings,
it
was
brought
out
and
that
was
the
reason
for
article
15
being
put
in,
so
that
there
was
a
safeguard
on
collective
bargaining.
and
there,
there
they
admit
that
there
would
be
a
conflict
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that
they
say
that
the
only
way
would
be
to
have
congress
enact
certain
laws
pertaining
to
labor
organizations.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
it's
not
--
this
is
not
in
the
brief.
this
is
in
the
4th
report
of
the
new
york
state
crime
commission,
new
york
state
legislature
document
number
70,
1953.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes,
sir.
this
is
an
addition
to
that.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
that's
right,
sir.
they
have
--
they
have
here
the
proposed
legislation
that
the
state
crime
commission
had
recommended
to
the
--
to
congress
in
the
compact.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
as
far
as
i
can
find
out,
nobody
seems
to
know
how
it
got
in.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
it
was
passed
in
1953
before
the
compact
was
ratified.
but
it
went
into
effect
after
the
compact
was
ratified
by
congress,
i
believe
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no,
sir.
but
there
was
very
few
--
there
were
very
few
days
notice
on
the
fact
that
the
--
the
statute
was
there.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
the
compact,
i
believe,
was
in
august
13th.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
i
think,
my
--
my
thinking
is
that
the
--
i
think
the
new
york
statute
was
passed
first,
and
then
the
new
jersey
statute
was
passed.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
the
new
york
statute
was
passed
before
the
compact.
the
new
york
statute
was
passed,
i
believe,
sometime
in
march.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
1953.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes,
sir.
that
was
in
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
well,
in
the
state
legislature,
the
recommendation
they
had
--
these
hearings.
and
there
was
a
proposed
legislation
on
setting
up
the
compact.
there
was
no
mention
of
any
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
the
--
the
law
--
actually,
section
8
was
passed
by
the
legislature
before
congress
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
well,
the
point
is
this.
that
since
section
8
was
passed
before
congress
ratifies
the
compact,
why
--
they
should
have
put
it
into
--
right
into
the
compact
and
spelled
out
that
they
--
they
were
giving
in
the
right
to
the
state
to
deny
felons
to
act
as
labor
officials.
here,
they
had
act
beforehand
and
--
and
the
findings
and
declarations
that
were
presented
to
congress
only
spelled
out
occupations
of
longshoremen,
hiring
agents
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no,
i
don't
say
that.
i
say
it
survives
the
compact
as
long
as
it
doesn't
conflict
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
--
with
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
i
--
i
say
that
congress
wasn't
aware
of
this
section
8.
they
had
no
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
there
seemed
to
have
been
only
--
only
a
--
i
mentioned
mr.
waldman
of
it
in
a
--
in
a
committee
hearing.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
i
don't
believe,
sir
that
there
was
any
discussion
in
congress
as
to
section
8.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
there
was
discussion
in
the
new
law
--
new
york
legislation
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
the
control
over
unions
and
union
affairs.
and
that
was
the
reason
article
15
was
put
into
the
compact
and
to
preserve
the
rights.
the
--
the
--
i
believe
we've
covered
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
and
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
--
it
still
--
it
still
is
--
it's
--
to
my
mind,
if
--
if
they
wanted
to
--
if
they
wanted
to
take
control
over
--
over
section
8,
they
should
have
included
it
in
--
in
the
compact
in
part
i
and
spelled
it
out
where
they
spell
out,
as
far
as
the
police
powers
as
to
longshoremen
and
hiring
agents
and
such
but
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
no,
sir.
but
then
we
have
the
question
as
to
whether
it's
in
conflict.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes,
sir.
the
only
other
point
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
there
was
some
mention
as
to
administrative
remedy.
here,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
had
passed
on
that
and
said
that
--
that
this
was
not
an
administrative
remedy
and
it
was
only
a
--
a
matter
of
grace
to
grant
a
--
a
certificate
of
good
conduct.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason
yes,
sir.
