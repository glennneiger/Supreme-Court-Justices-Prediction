mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
district
attorney
of
richmond
county
who
is
the
appellee
in
this
matter
before
your
honors
takes
the
position
in
the
outset
that
this
matter
has
become
moot
in
that
there
is
no
longer
a
bona
fide
controversy
existing
between
the
appellant
george
de
veau
and
the
appellee,
the
district
attorney
of
richmond
county
in
his
official
capacity
and
that
this
has
arisen
through
acts
and
conduct
not
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney.
the
port
of
new
york
is
a
large
sprawling
area
encompassing
three
counties
within
the
city
of
new
york
and
various
counties
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
staten
island
or
richmond
county
is
one
small
part
of
it.
at
the
time
of
the
initiation
of
this
action,
there
were
four
separate
and
distinct
locals
involved
with
the
checkers
of
cargo
on
the
piers
throughout
the
port
of
new
york.
each
of
these
locals
had
certain
territorial
limitations,
1346
of
which
de
veau
was
secretary-treasurer
had
by
charter
of
the
territory
of
richmond
county,
new
york,
staten
therefore,
when
it
was
made
known
to
the
district
attorney
of
richmond
county
of
the
possible
conflict
between
or
with
section
8
of
the
waterfront
commission
act
because
of
de
veau
previous
conviction
of
a
crime,
the
district
attorney
of
richmond
county
was
the
office
of
cognizable
with
that
statute
in
that
particular
case.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
it
was
called
for
the
attention
of
the
international
and
the
international,
the
president
of
the
international
longshoreman's
association
at
that
time
in
independent
suspended
de
veau.
no
prosecution
was
begun
by
the
district
attorney
under
section
8.
the
interna
--
or
de
veau
and
other
members
of
1346
originally
instituted
this
action
in
the
supreme
court
of
richmond
county
or
a
declaratory
judgment
and
for
an
injunction
restraining
the
district
attorney
of
richmond
county
from
enforcing
section
8
as
against
de
veau
in
his
capacity
as
secretary-treasurer
of
local
1346
or
anyone
else
because
of
de
veau's
position
as
secretary-treasurer
of
1346.
subsequently
it
now
appears
that
the
union
on
its
own
abolished
1346
and
issued
a
new
charter
to
a
new
local
called
local
1.
a
copy
of
that
charter
is
annexed
to
our
motion
papers
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
the
charter
provides
only
that
this
new
local
shall
jurisdiction
over
all
checkers
throughout
the
port
of
new
york.
the
charter
says,
absolutely
nothing
as
to
any
merger
with
other
locals
and
it
provides
simply
that
there
shall
be
officers
and
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
i
believe
four
secretary-treasurers.
it
provides
that
they
shall
be
elected
in
october
of
1960,
but
it
says
absolutely
nothing
as
to
who
shall
function
as
officers
in
the
interim.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court,
that
at
the
time
this
charter
was
granted,
de
veau
was
not
an
officer
of
1346.
he
had
been
suspended
by
the
president
of
the
international.
so
that
it
would
seem
to
the
appellee
that
any
action
that
would
be
taken
now
by
this
court
could
not
restore
de
veau
to
any
position
in
1346
since
it
does
not
exist.
and
it
seems
that
all
this
court
is
being
asked
to
do
is
render
an
advisory
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
de
veau
is
qualified
to
be
a
candidate
for
office
next
october.
and
we
urge
therefore
in
keeping
with
the
language
and
the
sentiments
expressed
by
this
court
only
yesterday
that
constitutional
issues
in
the
striking
down
the
statute
on
the
ground
--
on
constitutional
grounds
is
--
one
is
a
right
to
be
exercised
very
sparingly
and
to
be
exercise
--
and
should
not
be
exercised
when
there
is
no
bona
fide
contest
beginning
upon.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i'm
sorry
sir
i
don't
know.
i
don't
understand
you.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
the
grounds
advance
by
the
president
of
the
international,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
well,
he
was
suspended
from
1346
as
an
officer.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
1346
is
out
of
existence.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
do
not
think
the
suspension
would
do
that
sir.
it
is
the
contention
that
the
law
is
what
disables
this.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i'm
afraid
i
could
not
answer
that
sir.
the
appellee
would
have
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
there
is
nothing
that
we
know
sir
which
on
the
part
of
the
international
which
affects
that.
we
are
only
--
we
only
have
access
to
certain
of
the
information.
i
think
that
mr.
gleason
might
be
in
a
better
position
to
know
more
intimately.
there
have
been
no
minutes
of
meetings
or
any
other
agreements
among
these
locals
that
have
been
submitted
as
parts
of
briefs
or
otherwise.
so
that
on
that
question
sir
i
could
not
say
for
me
to
speculate
as
to
what
is
in
the
minds
of
captain
bradley
or
the
others.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
as
to
the
district
attorney
of
richmond
sir,
i
say
the
--
the
question
might
be
moot
because
whether
or
not
we
would
have
jurisdiction
under
this
new
local
would
also
oppose
a
problem
because
the
presence
of
the
offending
official
as
it
were,
as
a
officer
of
the
local
is
a
condition
precedent
to
a
local
prosecution,
other
situations
might
change.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct
sir.
the
point
is
that
we
feel
at
this
point,
there
is
no
longer
the
conflict
between
these
two
parties.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
correct
one
thing
first.
my
reading
of
the
charter
provides
not
that
they
will
cut
down
the
number
of
officers
in
october,
but
that
they
will
still
have
the
seven
vice
presidents,
four
secretary-treasurers
in
october.
as
to
your
question
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
cannot
sir
say
there
is
nothing
before
us,
before
the
court
as
to
any
agreement
along
these
lines.
it
could
have
been
by
fiat
of
the
international
that
the
merger
was
affected,
sometimes
these
arrangements
on
changing
locals
and
amalgamating
locals
have
the
tinge
of
a
shotgun
wedding.
there
is
nothing
before
us
sir
to
justify
that
decision.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
apparently,
sometime
in
1957.
it
did
not
come
to
our
attention.
it
was
not
mentioned
at
all
in
the
history
of
this
case,
or
through
the
court
of
appeal.
they
continued
to
operate
as
if
or
to
present
the
case
as
if
1346
still
existed
and
it
only
came
to
our
attention
after
the
matter
was
submitted
to
your
honors.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
we
did
not
put
it
in
the
record
sir
for
that
--
we
put
in,
in
our
motion
for
charter
when
we
learned
of
the
existence
of
the
situation.
mr.
gleason
submitted
a
--
a
reply
to
that
i
think
enclosing
or
incorporating
two
affidavits,
one
from
bradley
and
one
from
another
official
of
local
1
on
the
question.
we
are,
and
i
think
it
is
conceded
here
sir
that
1346
certainly
no
longer
exists
as
such.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
19
--this
was
1957,
yes
sir
and
i
think
that
might
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
suspended
as
such.
i
think
though,
it
also
incorporates
in
there
that
it
is
the
suspension
is
by
operation
of
the
statute
until
such
time
as
the
court
passes
upon.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
sir
is
only
from
the
argument
here
i
think
an
answer
to
a
question
to
your
honor
asked
mr.
gleason.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
other
than
the
charter
itself
which
was
appended
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
which
gives
complete
jurisdiction
over
all
checkers
to
this
new
local
1,
that's
at
page
8
of
our
appellee's
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
now,
further
if
the
court
please,
an
aside
from
the
question
of
mootness
which
your
honors
defer
until
the
hearing
of
the
case
on
its
merits,
the
people
--
the
district
attorney
of
richmond
county
contends
that
section
8
of
the
waterfront
commission
act
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
powers
of
the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
to
understand
the
nature
and
the
intent
of
section
8,
it
will
be
necessary
briefly
to
mention
the
history
of
section
8
and
the
conditions
which
brought
it
about.
for
many
years,
there
had
been
great
concern
as
to
certain
conditions
existing
in
waterfront
labor
organizations
in
the
port
of
new
york.
a
committee
or
a
commission
rather
known
at
various
times
as
the
new
york
state
crime
commission
or
the
(inaudible)
committee
conducted
investigations
over
a
period
of
several
years
in
which
they
went
into
the
question
of
certain
abuses
and
corrupt
practices
in
the
port
of
new
york.
in
their
report,
they
determined
that
over
30%
of
the
officials
of
waterfront
labor
unions
in
the
port
of
new
york
had
criminal
records
of
various
kinds.
they
found
as
a
fact
that
this
condition
gave
rise
to
many
abuses,
many
violations
of
law
to
extortion
from
the
union
employees
or
form
of
kickbacks,
the
so-called
notorious
shake
system
that
pilferage
and
larceny
from
the
port
of
new
york
were
all
--
were
tremendous
in
scope.
these
recommendations
were
forwarded
to
the
governor
of
new
york
who
then
hold
--
who
then
held
rather
further
hearings
on
the
matter
along
with
the
law
enforcement
council
of
new
jersey
and
further
evidence
was
adduced.
your
honors
will
find
reference
at
length
to
these
matters
in
the
brief
of
the
waterfront
commission
of
the
port
of
new
york
who
filed
the
brief
amicus
curiae.
based
upon
these
findings,
both
the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
legislation
was
proposed
which
led
to
the
creation
of
a
new
bi-state
agency
known
as
the
waterfront
commission.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
legislation
itself
is
divided
into
three
parts.
the
first
part
is
the
actual
contract
or
agreement
between
the
two
states
to
create
this
agency
to
police
the
port
of
new
york.
and
both
states
found
that
this
waterfront
crafts
and
the
people
who
worked
them,
longshoremen,
checkers
and
the
like,
that
these
occupations
smacked
of
the
public
interest
and
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
regulate
or
control
them
in
some
way.
now,
the
compact
provided
that
certain
of
these
of
occupations
should
licensed
and
that
a
license
must
be
granted
in
order
for
a
man
to
practice
that
occupation
on
the
waterfront
of
new
york.
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
these
appellant,
de
veau
could
not
at
the
moment
practice
the
occupation
of
checker
in
the
port
of
new
york,
even
though
he
seeks
to
be
representative
of
the
checkers.
now
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes
sir,
a
separate
section,
not
section
8.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
there
is
a
separate
section
licensing
checkers.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
and
de
veau
would
not
be
eligible
for
a
license
at
the
present
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
it
involves
the
issue
of
a
felony
conviction
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
the
reason
and
generally
speaking
throughout
the
whole
scheme
of
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
no,
sir
i'm
merely
pointing
it
out
that
this
not
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
no
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
don't
think
they
raised
that
would
be
probably
a
different
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
--
constitutional
objection.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
no,
i'm
merely
pointing
it
out
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
--
in
line
with
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
there
are
and
the
states
have
from
time
to
time
imposed
restrictions
on
certain
occupations
and
have
barred
people
from
engaging
in
certain
occupations
because
of
a
previous
felony
conviction.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes
sir,
but
i
don't
think
a
felony
conviction
will
buy
you.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
not
to
my
knowledge
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
there
is
none.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
no
sir.
i
might
correct
one
other
point
that
i'm
sure
was
inadvertent
on
mr.
gleason's
part.
he
mentioned
the
youthful
offender
act.
this
de
veau
would
not
have
come
under
the
youthful
offender
act
even
if
it
existed
in
those
days.
it
would
still
have
been
a
felony
even
in
those
days,
even
with
the
youthful
offender
act.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
no,
sir
just
before
he
worked
on
the
waterfront.
he
was
stealing
a
car.
now,
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
19
sir
at
that
time.
in
new
york
or
youthful
offender
act
stops
at
the
19th
birthday
and
anyone
over
that
is
chargeable
as
an
adult
felony.
the
statutes
or
the
enactments
of
the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
went
on
further
in
parts
two
and
three
aside
from
the
actual
interstate
compact
to
provide
certain
legislation
in
keeping
with
the
purposes
of
the
compact,
that
legislation
was
of
two
types.
some
of
it
was
reciprocal.
some
of
it
took
effect
in
either
state
upon
enactment
or
shortly
thereafter.
now
section
8,
the
section
with
which
we
are
concerned,
was
enacted
in
new
york
and
in
new
jersey
at
the
time
the
compact
was
enacted
and
was
on
the
books
and
had
been
passed
when
the
compact
was
submitted
to
the
congress
for
its
approval.
at
the
hearings
held
before
the
congress,
the
question
of
section
8
was
brought
up
by
the
ila
representative.
the
same
question
of
preemption,
the
same
question
of
hill
against
florida
was
presented
to
the
congress
at
the
time
it
was
considering
approval
of
the
compact.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes
sir.
we
--
we
have
reference
to
it
in
our
brief.
the
congress
nevertheless
passed
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
we
--
we've
only
referred
to
the
--
i
think
at
page
of
the
hearings
at
which
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
--
the
reference
was
made.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
by
name
sir.
it
was
referred
to.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
in
the
report
of
the
hearings
sir.
i
do
not
know
that's
in
its
report
congress
or
any
of
the
committees
specifically
referred
to
in
hill
against
florida
but
it
had
been
brought
up
at
the
committee
hearings.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
by
mr.
waldman
who
was
the
counsel
to
international
longshoremen's
association.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
believe
sir
at
page
21
or
22
rather
of
the
waterfront
commission's
brief
amicus.
they
make
reference
to
certain
of
the
findings.
i
do
not
see
that
they
made
specific
reference
to
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
22
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
they
do
not
--
they
did
not
make
specific
reference
to
hill
against
florida
at
that
time,
but
they
--
it
was
at
the
hearings
which
are
referred
to
at
page
26
of
the
waterfront
commission
brief
where
the
statement
of
mr.
waldman
appears.
mr.

sir
of
the

commission's
brief.
mr.
thomas
r.

there
was
no
specific
reference
other
than
that
in
certain
of
the
approval
congress
has
given
to
bi-state
agencies
such
as
the
port
authority.
they
specifically
withheld
those
words.
mr.

sir.
usually
the
approval
of
congress
is
given
to
the
specific
compact
and
further
actions
between
the
states
in
furtherance
of
the
compact
in
many
instances
has
to
go
back
to
congress
for
further
approval.
this
was
a
very
sweeping
grant
of
power
by
congress.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
they
had
been
enacted
sir.
the
--
the
--
i
believe
they
had
been
enacted
in
june
of
1953.
there
hearings
were
in
august
or
the
congressional
hearings
on
the
compact.
the
effect
of
dates
of
the
statutes
in
both
new
york
and
new
jersey
was
september
1st.
but
they
had
been
enacted,
they
were
on
the
books
and
they
were
referred
to
in
the
congressional
hearings.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
--
i
do
believe
sir
the
reason
for
the
separate
parts
was
that
sir,
some
of
the
legislation
was
to
take
effect
only
in
new
york
for
instance
when
new
jersey
passed
recent
--
similar
legislation.
certain
areas
covered
by
the
waterfront
commission
act
were
to
take
effect
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
other
state
applied
that
--
or
enacted
the
same
legislation.
now,
congress
too
in
approving
the
compact
recognized
that
we
had
here
was
a
uniquely
local
situation.
it
was
not
an
attempt
by
the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
to
regulate
all
labor
unions,
because
the
conditions
which
existed
were
not
shown
to
have
existed
at
all
labor
unions.
but
here,
there
was
a
situation
existing
in
one
segment
of
one
industry,
and
the
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
powers
sought
to
remedy
this
local
situation,
this
local
condition
that
was
preying
upon
its
citizens
by
the
enactment
of
local
legislation.
congress
recognized
this
situation,
recognized
that
it
was
a
local
situation
and
gave
its
approval
to
the
attempts
of
the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
to
regulate,
to
control,
to
license
entire
--
an
entire
industry
and
in
fact
to
eliminate
certain
phases
of
that
industry
because
included
in
the
waterfront
commission
act
was
a
statute
banning
what
was
commonly
referred
to
as
public
loading
which
had
a
been
recognized
business
prior
to
the
enactment.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
licensing
provisions,
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes
sir
the
checkers
were
considered
a
classification
or
sub-classification
of
longshoremen.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
public
loading
sir
was
the
situation
that
a
truck
would
deliver
cargo
to
a
pier
or
to
pick
up
cargo,
rather
from
a
pier.
it
had
to
be
brought
from
the
end
of
the
pier
wherever
it
was
located
out
and
put
on
the
truck.
there
were
certain
companies
which
existed
solely
to
pick
up
the
cargo
from
the
pier
and
load
it
on
board
the
truck
for
the
trucking
--
for
the
truck
man
so
he
did
not
have
to
send
a
helper
along
with
the
driver
to
put
it
on
board.
and
that
practice
--
and
that
business
was
avouched
by
the
waterfront
commission
act.
now,
there
is
a
claim
made
that
section
8
of
the
waterfront
commission
act
conflicts
with
the
general
language
of
section
7
of
the
national
labors
relations
act.
this
claim
was
made
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
are
you
referring
sir
to
the
findings
and
declarations
of
the
two
states
or
the
--
the
so-called
reservations
section?
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
if
i
read
it
correctly
sir
the
--
it
is
the
section
that
reads
this
compact
is
simply
saying
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
it's
article
15
of
the
compact.
that's
at
page
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
believe
mr.
gleason
has
cited
it
in
his
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
--
in
their
reply
brief
at
page
7.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
well
sir
this
statute,
section
8
in
no
way
--
in
our
opinion,
impairs
the
rights
of
the
union
to
bargain
collectively
or
to
organize.
it
does
in
some
respect
create
certain
conditions
under
which
the
union
or
with
which
the
union
is
confronted
if
they
elect
a
certain
class
of
person
as
their
representative.
i
might
answer
that
section
8
is
not
a
part
of
the
compact.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
the
--
the
union
is
placed
under
certain
handicaps
if
they
elect
a
felony
as
one
of
their
officers.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
no,
sir.
i'm
saying
you
asked
me
to
comment
on
--
on
how
i
think
this
section
affects
the
case
we're
discussing.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
statute
only
provides
that
nothing
shall
be
limited
in
any
way
the
right
of
the
employees
to
organize
or
to
bargain
collectively
through
labor
organizations
or
other
representatives
of
their
own
choosing.
in
connection
with
that
sir,
i
do
not
think
that
this
statute
interferes
with
the
rights
of
employees
to
bargain
collectively
or
to
choose
whomever
they
wish
as
their
representative.
it
does
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
it
does
provide
sir
certain
hindrances
if
they
choose
him
as
their
representative
much
the
same
as
certain
enactments
of
the
congress
--
ban
the
use
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
if
a
certain
official
of
the
union
does
not
file
a
non-communist
affidavit.
by
same
token
they
are
perfectly
free
to
select
as
a
representative
a
man
who
is
in
jail
but
he
certainly
isn't
going
to
able
to
get
out
to
attend
the
meetings
and
they
--
if
they
accept
this
and
they're
willingly
vote
him
in
they
face
certain
consequences.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
but
we
do
not
feel
sir
that
this
is
a
direct
attempt
to
dictate
the
choice
of
the
employees.
they
are
free
to
choose
whomever
they
wish
if
they
wish
to
vote,
they
can
have
him,
he
bargain
for
them,
he
will
be
accepted
as
such.
there
is
no
contention
here
that
his
presence
as
an
officer
in
any
way,
detracts
from
the
ability
of
this
local
to
perform
its
functions
as
a
collective
bargaining
agent
as
in
fact
to
distinctions
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
in
that
--
as
a
collective
bargaining
agent,
absolutely
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
subject
to
prosecution,
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
i
said
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
to
collect
dues?
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
absolutely
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
--
the
thing
sir
is
the
same
that
the
--
right
to
appear
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
an
important
function
of
a
labor
organization.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
i
had
not
--
i
have
not
addressed
myself
so
exclusively
to
this
question
of
preemption.
i
will
be
happy
to
do
so
now
sir.
the
question
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
very
much
so
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
question
of
preemption
is
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
conflict
or
whether
or
not
the
congress
has
so
occupied
the
field
of
labor
management
as
to
take
away
from
the
states
all
rights
to
act
for
safety,
for
the
good
and
the
welfare
of
their
own
citizens
in
anything
touching
upon
labor
organizations
is
one
of
the
key
issues
that
has
been
raised
by
the
appellant
throughout
the
history
of
this
case.
not
only
throughout
the
history
of
this
case,
but
throughout
almost
every
case
that
has
been
brought
under
the
waterfront
commission
act.
up
till
the
time
that
this
case
reached
this
court
the
highest
court
that
had
passed
upon
a
similar
statute
was
as
has
been
pointed
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
the
case
of
hazelton
against
murray
in
which
this
question
of
preemption
was
presented
squarely
before
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
and
which
mr.
justice
brennan
in
speaking
for
the
unanimous
court
there
held
that
congress
had
not
so
preempted
the
field
as
to
bar
the
states
from
enacting
section
8.
the
same
question
was
--
was
raised
in
the
federal
courts
in
the
(inaudible)
cases,
and
the
staten
island
loaders
cases
in
various
aspects
concededly
of
the
waterfront
commission
act.
at
least
some
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
no
sir.
the
hazelton
against
murray
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
–
(inaudible)
and
the
loaders'
cases
were.
yes
sir
they
came
up
under
the
compact.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
there
are
many
of
them
some
outside
the
compact
area
are
rock
and
others
which
were
in
the
federal
district
court
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
which
these
questions
all
were
raised
as
to
preemption.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
you
mean
the
disclosure
act
of
1959?
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
no
sir,
they
were
all
under
the
old
act
under
seven
of
the
nlra.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
it's
the
first
time
it
has
been
mentioned
sir.
we
contend
that
is
not
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
believe
sir
that
the
--
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
you
must
in
revealing
a
state
court
consider
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
state
court
passed
upon
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
well
in
concerning
the
question
of
preemption
sir,
we
have
now
reached
the
happy
stage
some
15
years
later
where
we
now
find
ourselves
directly
in
the
situation
that
was
then
a
hypothetical
one
posed
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent.
can
we
now
say
in
the
view
of
the
enactment
of
the
provisions
of
that
1959
disclosure
act
that
section
7
of
the
nlra
covered
it
before
or
excluded
it
before?
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
at
the
time
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct
sir.
this
argument
was
never
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
simple
fact
that's
1959
--
the
labor
management
act
of
1959
had
not
been
enacted.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
if
that
were
so
sir,
the
question
was
raised
that
the
preemption
was
existed
under
7th.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
--
was
enacted
subsequent
to
the
(inaudible)
appealed
decision
in
this
case,
whether
any
pre-emption
claim
based
on
the
labor
management
relation
act
of
1959
is
properly
before
the
--
before
the
courts
or
since
it
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
court
below.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
question
of
what
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
--
whether
or
not,
the
congress
through
the
enactment
of
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
so
occupied
the
entire
field
of
labor
relations,
labor
management
relations
that
the
states
have
no
right
in
anyway
to
impose
any
limitation
or
qualification
or
restriction
at
all
on
who
shall
be
representatives
of
labor
unions.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
think
the
1959
act,
sir,
can
be
construed
as
evidentiary
in
--
in
determining
the
intent
of
congress
when
they
had
enacted
section
7.
but
that
there
is
--
that
the
square
conflict
as
to
this
section
8
of
the
waterfront
commission
act
and
the
labor-management
disclosure
act
of
1959
was
not
properly
--
was
not
brought
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
no
decision
was
rendered
on
it.
and
therefore,
that
this
court
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
issue
of
pre-emption
was
certainly
was,
sir.
and
at
that
point
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
issue
of
pre-emption
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
section
8
was
pre-empted
by
the
congress
enacting
section
7
and
also
by
your
--
this
court's
decision
in
hill
against
florida.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes,
sir.
i
believe
they
could
completely
occupy
the
field
if
they
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
--
i
--
i
don't
see
the
exact
relevance
to
this
because
we
are
dealing
here
not
with
a
future
election,
but
with
a
past
election
--
with
the
past
power
to
hold
office
with
the
--
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
well,
that
is
not
--
i
say
that,
sir,
in
connection
with
whether
or
not,
there
is
any
valid
controversy
between
the
parties.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
would
not
completely
agree
with
your
analysis
of
it,
sir.
i
do
not
think
--
first
of
all,
there
were
no
formal
proceedings
ever
brought.
whether
or
not
it
is
a
question
as
to
his
eligibility
to
run
in
the
1960
election,
i
could
not
say
that
that
is
what
we
are
concerned
with
here.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
1346.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
well,
he
could
be
restored.
i
--
i
don't
agree
completely
that
he
could
not
be
restored.
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
don't
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue,
sir,
because
he's
gotten
his
salary
all
along.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
in
1956
--
1957,
early
part
of
1957.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
would
seem
to
be
the
case,
sir,
whether
or
not,
section
8
was
a
valid
--
whether
or
not,
it
was
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
powers
or
whether
or
not,
it
had
been
pre-empted
by
congress
at
the
time
the
litigation
was
put.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
well,
assuming
sir
that
the
kind
of
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
we
are
deciding
his
eligibility
to
run
for
office
in
1960.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
i
would
say
sir
that
again,
i
must
go
--
i
can
only
go
back
to
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past.
that
in
deciding
state
courts
and
in
deciding
the
validity
of
state
statutes
which
is
what
we're
concerned
with
here,
the
court
will
not
consider
an
intervening
event.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
--
the
point,
sir,
is
that
if
that
is
his
aim,
if
that
is
the
appellant's
aim
here,
he
is
not
without
recourse.
there
is
no
--
he
can
institute
the
action
now
in
light
of
the
1959
amendment,
or
the
1959
act.
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
action
that
was
commenced
under
a
certain
set
of
facts
and
circumstances
and
if
you
will,
to
ground
rules
through
the
fault
of
no
one
between
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
and
the
time
it
is
presented
before
your
honors.
congress
has
changed
or
has
modified
in
some
respect,
the
law.
we
are
now
here
as
i
envision
it
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
as
of
the
time
they'd
decided
it
and
that
the
question
of
the
1959
act
never
having
been
raised
at
that
point,
we
--
we
feel
is
not
properly
in
view
of
the
--
the
past
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
same
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
1959
act
when
taken
in
--
in
connection
with
the
question
of
mootness
sir,
certainly
shows
the
complex
situation
that
has
been
created
not
only
by
the
abolition
or
of
--
of
1346
but
also
the
enactment
of
the
labor
management
disclosure
act
of
1959.
the
situation
is
that
the
parties
to
this
action
would
probably
be
entirely
different,
at
least
insofar
as
the
appellee
is
concerned
that
there
would
no
longer
be
the
controversy,
even
under
the
1959
act.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
sir,
we
do
not
feel
that
it
does,
and
we
have
so
stated
both
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee
and
in
the
brief
of
the
waterfront
commission
amicus
curiae.
the
waterfront
commission
has
filed
amicus
throughout
this
since
--
although
they
are
not
the
parties
to
the
--
party
to
the
action,
they
are
most
vitally
concerned
with
it
since
they
are
the
administrators
of
the
compact.
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
question
fully
gone
into
in
the
briefs
and
why
we
say
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
1959
act
and
the
labor
management
disclosure
act
--
section
8
in
the
labor
management
disclosure
act
of
1959
because
there
are
certain
saving
clauses
in
the
1959
act
which
provide
that
in
addition
to
the
remedies
supplied
therein,
that
any
employee
of
a
labor
union
is
saved,
any
existing
right
he
had
or
any
protection
he
had
under
any
state
act.
that
is
expressly
contained
in
section
103.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
it's
at
page
15,
sir,
of
the
appellee's
brief.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct
sir,
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
well,
section
--
1
--
103,
sir,
specifically
is
the
saving
clause,
which
generally
speaking,
saves
the
rights
of
the
states
at
least
insofar
as
they
confer
benefit
on
any
member
of
a
labor
organization.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct.
it
is
--
and
that
saves
the
rights
of
members
under
state
acts.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
and
a
member
does
have
certain
rights
under
section
8.
also,
603,
page
41
of
the
waterfront
commission's
brief,
603
(a)
and
at
page
15
of
the
appellees
brief,
expressly
reserves
that
except
as
explicitly
provided
to
the
contrary,
nothing
in
this
act
shall
reduce
or
limits
--
or
limit
the
responsibilities
of
any
labor
organization
or
of
any
officer,
agent
shops,
do
it
or
other
representative
of
the
labor
organization,
or
by
any
remedy.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
not
to
have
felons
as
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
absolutely,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
quite
correct,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
if,
sir,
the
proper
foundation,
i
believe,
were
found
to
exist,
if
the
need
--
the
evil
was
shown
to
exist
and
that
the
statute
in
question
here
was
reasonably
connected
to
that.
if,
for
instance,
the
port
of
new
york
were
entirely
within
the
confines
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
situation
was
shown
to
exist
in
that
port,
that
was
demonstrated
to
exist
in
the
port
of
new
york,
sir,
for
the
safety,
the
well-being
of
the
citizens
of
new
york,
we
feel
the
state
of
new
york
would
have
had
the
right
independent
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
--
compact.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
sir.
the
compact
merely,
in
its
approval,
in
the
process
it
was
--
of
its
approval
at
some
indicia
that
congress
recognized
this
situation.
and
it
is
only
because
it
was
a
compact
that
it
came
before
congress
for
approval,
if
it
was
purely
within
the
state
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
the
response
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes,
sir.
and
it
is
the
responsibilities
that
they
have
under
any
state
or
other
law.
the
responsibility
would
be
in
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
to
--
if
they
have
elected
a
felon,
as
an
officer,
to
refrain
from
the
collection
of
dues.
as
to
their
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes,
sir.
that
was
precisely
the
manner
in
which
this
came
up
as
you
will
see
from
the
original
papers
in
the
supreme
court
in
new
york.
the
officers
of
the
international
were
called
in,
were
advised
of
the
existence
of
this
conviction
and
were
also
advised
of
the
terms
of
section
8.
and
i
might
point
out,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
under
the
terms
of
section
8,
there
is
an
administrative
remedy
open
to
anyone
found
to
be
so
disabled.
and
this
has
been
resorted
to
from
time
to
time
by
union
officials
in
similar
circumstances.
and
the
disability
has
been
cleared
administratively.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
it
is
not
an
order
of
the
waterfront
commission,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
if
--
in
this
case
was
done
informally,
they
were
called
in,
apprised
of
the
situation,
apprised
of
a
possible
violation
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
the
international.
and
the
international
then
acted
without
any
further
action
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
oh
yes,
sir.
as
they
did
here,
they
started
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
an
injunction
or
they
could
--
if
they
wanted
to
be
extreme,
await
an
arrest
which
was
never
contemplated
or
never
done
yet.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
sir.
in
our
particular
instance,
it
was
discovered
that
there
was
a
young
lady
who
was
collecting
dues
in
the
county,
not
de
veau.
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
yes,
sir.
because
throughout
the
act,
the
labor
management
disclosure
act,
where
the
congress
wanted
their
procedures
to
be
explicit,
they
so
stated
and
the
waterfront
commission
points
it
out
in
its
brief.
in
many
instances
they
said,
“compliance
with
our
--
with
our
law
shall
be
sufficient
for
any
state.”
there
are
certain
reports
that
are
required
under
the
labor
management
disclosure
act
and
they
specifically
state,
“no
state
shall
require
anything
further
than
a
copy
of
this.”
but
on
103,
i
believe
it
is
--
it's
not
103
but
the
section
creating
the
qualification
requirements,
no
such
reservation
is
included
at
all.
in
summary
--
mr.
thomas
r.
sullivan
no,
sir.
but
i
do
say
that
where
in
a
scheme
of
things,
they
specifically
say
in
a
and
b
and
court,
“this
is
all
that
is
required
and
no
state
may
require
more
and
that
they
don't
say
it
insofar
as
d
is
concerned.
it
is
some
indicia
that
they
did
not
intend
to
pre-empt
as
to
d.
thank
you
very
much.
