justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
suspension
alive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
suspended
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
the
suspension
was
connected
with
inquiries
or
the
action
taken
by
your
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
asking
is
whether
the
suspension
is
still
indeed,
he
is
still
suspended
in
other
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
what
i'm
--
the
point
of
my
question
is
whether
if
suspension
as
an
officer
has
--
from
his
office
in
1346
would
carry
with
it
because
of
the
action
taken
by
you,
by
the
attorney,
would
carry
with
it
his
disability,
automatic
disability
to
run
as
an
office
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
--
but
the
law
is
still
in
content.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
action
taken
by
the
international
continues
to
operate
wholly
apart
from
what
obedience
to
the
statute
in
which
to
be
accepted
on
its
face
i
suppose
to
this
to
the
inference
(inaudible)
unconstitutional.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
suspension
is
an
ingredient
(inaudible)
in
disabling
him
from
being
a
candidate
a
suspension
due
to
--
derived
from
the
action
of
the
international?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
think
that's
relevant
to
your
--
to
your
question
of
mootness,
your
claim
of
mootness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
to
you
--
i
don't
like
put
a
hypothetical
case.
suppose
a
proper
--
appropriate
into
making
a
basis
for
the
court
that
the
international
would
deem
itself
bound
by
the
considerations
that
move
into
suspending
from
1346
to
disallow
him
as
a
candidate
for
office
in
the
new
local
1.
suppose,
that
were
appropriately
before
the
phase
--
before
the
court,
what
would
you
then
say
about
mootness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
mean
that
--
that
would
be
a
constitutional
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it's
a
basis
of
disqualification
of
getting
a
license
involving
the
same
issue
akin
to
the
issue
to
the
one
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
a
fact
that
he
couldn't
be
a
checker
if
you
ask
him
to
become
an
officer
is
in
itself
involving
him
in
the
case
you're
arguing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
that
the
question
of
a
checker's
license
was
involved
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
your
argument
that
he
couldn't
even
get
a
checker's
license
is
--
is
in
controversy
because
of
the
nature
of
the
issue
which
would
disqualify.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
and
i
simply
suggest
you
can't
derive
any
argument
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
plumber
has
to
be
licensed
in
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
terms
or
in
part
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
held
that
later
enactment
does
not
exclude
the
earlier
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
controversy
of
this
case?
what
do
you
think
the
litigation
is
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
specifically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
that
--
that
the
1959
act
must
be
construed
whether
new
york
today
can
take
action
in
--
take
the
kind
of
action
it's
seeking
to
take
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
could
congress
in
1959
pass
an
act
which
would
displace
the
power
of
the
state
to
deal
with,
deciding
the
qualifications
for
officers
in
a
labor
union,
in
elections
following
the
enactment
of
1959?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
future
elections?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
what's
the
relevance
of
that
answer
of
yours
to
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
point
of
view,
that's
gone.
from
your
point
of
view,
the
--
the
union
doesn't
exist
and
what's
involved
is
the
election
of
1960s.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
you're
wrong
about
--
assume
you're
wrong
under
a
moot
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
what
is
involved
is
the
disqualification
by
virtue
of
the
proceedings
that
you
brought
against
his
running
in
the
1960
elections.
that
is
the
situation,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he's
been
suspended.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
you
--
are
you
saying
that
you
--
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
whether
his
suspension,
operating
under
the
1955
act
that
it
could
be
adjudicated
by
the
court.
you
say
it
isn't
to
be
adjudicated
because
it's
moot.
forget
that
for
a
moment.
assuming
there's
no
question
of
mootness
and
assume
that
--
what
was
the
number
of
the
union,
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1340
--
assume
1346
had
a
continuing
life
and
you
were
suspended.
now,
he
couldn't
--
he
--
because
he
couldn't
be
restored
--
he
couldn't
restored
for
that
office
because
your
time
is
gone.
that's
irreplaceable,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
does
want
to
run
again
in
1960.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he
might
get
his
salary.
he
hasn't
--
he
lost
his
salary
and
that
wasn't
mentioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
i
can
understand
that
you're
saying
that
what
is
past
is
past
and
if
new
york
was
entitled
to
disqualify
him
--
when
did
it
first
disqualify
him,
1950?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1957.
that
nothing
that
congress
did
in
1959
can
undo
what
the
purposes
of
argument
as
the
legal
power
of
new
york
in
1957,
i
understand
that.
but
if
you
go
beyond
that
and
say
--
that
the
court
must
decide
that.
and
the
court
--
all
that
the
court
has
to
decide,
would
you
say
is
whether
he
--
he
should
be
declared
to
have
been
properly
disqualified
in
1957?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
give
to
you
another
aspect
of
this,
suppose
the
court
rejects
your
moot
argument
on
the
ground
that
--
while
(inaudible)
is
gone,
he
is
the
new
manifestation
of
1346
and
there's
an
election
up
in
the
1960,
and
(inaudible)
says
that
he
would
beat
him
despite
of
that
--
the
suspension
continues,
according
to
his
affidavits.
and
therefore,
it's
not
moot
because
of
the
issue
is
whether
he
can
qualify
for
candidate
in
1960,
assume
--
assume
that
state
of
fact.
on
--
on
that
assumption,
is
the
1959
act
pertinent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
that
in
order
to
answer
your
moot
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
the
election
of
1960
becomes
pertinent
and
the
intervening
event
isn't
an
intervening
event
as
the
past
but
it
looks
to
the
future.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i've
put
to
you
the
relevance
of
the
consideration
of
mootness
to
this
litigation.
this
court
has
held
into
cases
in
connection
with
the
--
didn't
you
say
commerce
commission
or
the
federal
trades
commission
that
an
order
may
expend
its
force
and
the
case
would
be
moot
but
for
the
fact
that
another
order
like
the
one
in
controversy
in
the
charge
next
week,
saving
the
case
for
mootness.
and
so
i'm
suggesting
that
somebody
moot,
maybe
sympathetically,
your
point
view
on
mootness
might
not
go
all
the
way
with
you
because
you
would
feel
that
the
same
controversy
arises
as
--
right
in
front
of
you,
and
therefore
the
case
is
not
moot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
aspect,
what
happened
in
1959
may
bear
on
what
should
be
done
with
the
reference
to
1960?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
your
--
i
follow
your
argument
on
mootness.
would
you
care
to
express
an
opinion,
i
would
understand
you
would
--
but
it's
not
here.
would
you
care
to
and
express
an
opinion,
whether
in
your
view,
the
1959
legislation
of
congress,
the
plan,
section
8.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
this
notice
agenda
procedures,
isn't
it?
is
the
international
--
does
the
international
give
him
notice
that
this
man
was
a
felon
and
must
do
something
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
the
union
itself
contest
the
order
of
the
waterfront
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
district
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they,
being
the
union?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
contest
it?
suppose
they,
say,
you
got
the
wrong
man?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
long
preceding
(inaudible)
what's
the
date
of
the
compact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
was
--
didn't
mr.
waldman
address
himself
to
that
problem
he
solved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
he
did
talk
about
section
8,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
anymore
except
this
quotation.where
is
that
nn
which
he
seemed
to
know
about
section
8?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
waldman
is
no
mean
lawyer
as
you
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
fact
that
it's
prepared
shows
thoughtfulness,
without
even
casualties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
do
you
say
section
8
got
into
the
new
york
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
said
when
did
it
get?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
new
york
enactments
aren't
secret.
they're
not
in
--
they're
not
in
hiding,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
compact
was
signed
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
if
the
--
i
don't
get
the
then
direction
of
your
argument.
lots
of
legislations
sometimes
extremely
important
legislation,
this
past
august
on
the
recommend
--
on
proposals
from
the
floor.
what
is
the
point
of
this
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
nothing
that's
in
the
compact,
in
the
--
in
--
that
new
york
legislation
that
isn't
particularized
with
compact,
designed
in
the
compact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
draw
a
conflict
from
the
non-mentioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
waldman
told
them
so
that
it
couldn't
have
been
a
secret,
and
--
and
one
knows
one
has
a
right
to
--
to
take
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
this
was
not
a
--
was
in
the
corner
affair,
all
the
papers
are
full
of
it.
counsel
for
the
international
knew
all
about
it.
all
the
interested
parties
knew
all
about
it.
there's
more
publicity
about
this
than
about
most
legislations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it
was
the
counsel
for
the
international
and
a
very
effective
counsel,
not
only
in
this
regard,
i
don't
know
about
that,
but
generally.
and
all
that
is
whistle
down
to
win,
because
it
was
put
into
legislation
on
the
act
for
two
or
three
days
discussion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
argument
was
there
wasn't
much
discussion
even
in
the
new
york
legislature,
you
can't
trace
the
source
of
section
8,
aren't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
another
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
thing
to
put
in
also,
as
mr.
sullivan
points
out.
603
supposedly
dealt
with
something,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
in
terms
deal
with
it,
does
in
negative,
the
power
of
new
york
to
deal
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right
and
that's
what
you're
arguing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
we
couldn't
pass
on
that
any
how.
that's
a
construction
of
the
new
york
statute.
