justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
notice
you
say
an
occupation,
the
fact
that
he
has
been
convicted
(inaudible)
an
occupation.
you
don't
mean
to
say
any
occupation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
say
that
one
who
has
his
felony
may
not
licensed
to
practice
law
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
trying
to
understand
if
you
would
say
the
state
without
power
to
deprive
one
who
has
judge
guilty
of
a
felony
from
occupying
at
least
some
positions
of
trust
to
officers
in
the
state.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
election,
how
often
in
that
union
has
it
existed
when
he
was
an
officer
or
the
election
is
held,
for
what
term?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
five
years.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gleason
i'm
interested
on
this
question
of
mootness
and
might
i
ask
you
just
a
question
to
about
it
please.
is
the
union
local
to
which
petitioner
belonged
and
of
which
he
was
an
officer
at
the
time
of
this
action
in
1957
still
in
existence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
by
contract?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
i
had
thought,
now
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this,
that
union
officers
were
elected
by
the
members
of
the
union
and
not
appointed
by
contract
of
the
existing
officers,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
that
was
done
by
contract
of
the
parties
--
of
the
officers.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now
then,
that
did
as
i
understand
you
extinguish
the
local,
what's
the
number?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
1346.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
would
this
--
this
petitioner
in
order
to
become
an
officer
of
local
1
have
to
meet
the
members
in
an
election?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that's
another
question.
i
was
just
trying
to
find
out
what
is
the
real
reason
here
(inaudible)
this
union
office
was
an
officer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
where
do
i
find
in
the
record
saying
that
1346
is
abolished,
as
i
understood
you
to
say
it
was?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
does
public
loading
mean?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
if
the
--
if
the
preemption
was
created
by
that
1959
act
then
it
first
came
into
being
at
that
time,
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
the
same
document,
in
the
third,
in
the
waterfront
brief
at
page
56?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
what's
the
--
