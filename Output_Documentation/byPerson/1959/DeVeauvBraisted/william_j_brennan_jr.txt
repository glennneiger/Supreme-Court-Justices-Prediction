justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gleason,
i
am
curious
not
at
all
relevant,
but
is
there
any
effort
to
bring
hazelton
and
murray
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wrote
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
it
was
the
--
was
there
any
effort
to
have
it
reviewed
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
was
interested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
this
is
--
this
case
brings
this
question
to
us
for
the
first
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
decided.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
gleason,
the
--
with
this
compact,
not
section
8,
but
there
was
a
compact
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
approved
by
the
congress.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
compact
had
appended
to
it,
did
it
not,
the
consent
of
congress
is
hereby
given
to
the
compact
and
to
the
carrying
out
an
effectuation
of
said
compact
and
enactments
in
furtherance
thereof.
you
attach
any
significance
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wasn't
section
8
in
the
statute
which
was
part
of
an
enactment
with
a
counterpart
enactment
in
new
jersey
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
furtherance
of
the
compact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
was
done
separately
by
the
legislatures
of
the
two
states
but
were
not
the
statutes
of
the
two
states
in
furtherance
of
the
compact
after
congress
had
approved
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
for
whatever
its
worth,
and
the
congress
at
least
afforded
to
give
here
a
general
approval
of
an
enactments
in
furtherance
of
the
compact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
no
limitation
in
the
language.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
article
15
of
the
compact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there's
nothing
here
but
free
choice
of
representatives,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
--
what's
the
significance
in
mr.
bradley's
affidavit
mr.
sullivan
on
that
thing?
the
suspension
of
de
veau
continued
and
necessary
must
continue
as
long
as
section
8
is
affective,
affidavit
sworn
to
january
11,
1960.
you
said
this
merger
was
1956-1957?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
spelled
out
or
do
you
just
have
it
referred
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
is
there
any
special
legislative
history
involving
those
words
of
the
approval
in
the
enactments
in
furtherance
thereof?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
unusual
isn't
it
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
i
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
respect
of
new
jersey
and
new
york
statutes
which
had
counterparts
of
section
8
had
actually
been
adopted
by
the
two
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
why
these
that
--
that
those
were
not
incorporated
in
the
compact
itself,
why
do
we
have
these
separate
parts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
part
of
the
compact
itself,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
was
the
checker's
provision
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
for
the
licensing
of
longshoremen
and
the
checkers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
thing
that
happens
as
i
understand
it
is
that
anyone
who
collects
dues
in
behalf
of
the
organization
then
he's
guilty
of
a
crime
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let's
see
mr.
sullivan.
am
i
right
that
(inaudible)
and
the
loaders
cases
came
up
rather
what
was
decided
there
were
issues
raised
under
provisions
of
the
compact
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
know
the
hazelton
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
compact
itself.
both
the
licensing
in
the
loaders'
provision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
that
distinction
i
don't
know
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
argument
on
how
congress
does
have
specialty
to
these
problems
herein
and
state
--
state
statutes
interpreted
the
agreement
that
this
would
be
(inaudible)
among
those
in
the
cities
in
ways
state
actions
was
to
serve
(inaudible)
in
a
state
act
like
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
what's
the
--
another
(inaudible)
waterfront
commission
sees
for
the
federal
such
that
(inaudible)
particularly
as
to
rely
on
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
these
are
the
consequences
of
the
labor
organizations
because
this
section
is
a
response
to
the
--
the
waterfront
and
also
(inaudible)
not
to
collect
duties,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
this
whole
part
of
those
disqualifications
in
collection
of
duties
if
you
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
officers
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
the
labor
organizations
believe
on
what
to
pay
their
tenants.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
collective
bargaining
agreement,
or
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
a
responsibility
merely
to
(inaudible)
in
respect
of
collection
of
dues
but
not
in
the
middle
to
collect
duties
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
and
the
person
arrested
would
not
necessarily
be
the
felon,
it
would
be
whoever
in
the
union
collected
dues
after
his
election
as
an
officer,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sullivan,
may
i
ask?
i
take
it
though
you
have
to
argue
also,
looking
again
at
603,
that
the
provisions
of
the
1959
disclosure
act,
establishing
the
standards
for
disqualification
for
union
office,
do
not
satisfy
the
definition
of
--
except
as
exquisitely
provided
for
the
contrary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
this
mr.
gleason,
very
few
days
notice.
as
i
understood
your
adversary
and
i've
forgotten
the
date.
my
recollection
too
is
that
the
new
jersey
statute
at
least
could
pass
several
months
before
the
--
the
consideration
by
congress
of
the
compact,
am
i
in
earnest
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
so,
then
the
new
york
statute
is
not
much
older
than
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
what
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
isn't
that
what
mr.
waldman
was
addressing
himself
to
in
august?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
quite
understand
what
you
mean
by
only
two
or
three
days
notice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
mean
that
the
--
there
was
only
two
or
three
days
notice
of
the
proposed
state
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
not
of
the
federal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
misunderstood
you,
i
thought
you
were
speaking
(voice
