mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
pardon
me,
i
--
i
apologize.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
--
i
want
to
say
that
we
have
two
cases
for
argument
today.
one
is
no.
549,
the
appellees
are
all
registrars
or
voters
of
state
of
louisiana,
that
the
attorney
general
represents
in
federal
matters,
by
virtue
of
an
act
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
other
case
is
six
individuals
who
were
subpoenaed
by
compulsory
process
to
attend
this
proposed
hearing.
there
is
no
connection
between
either
one
of
these
particular
cases.
i
wanted
to
make
that
clear.
although
the
suits
were
filed
simultaneous,
because
of
necessity,
they're
completely
independent
of
each
other.
they
were
consolidated
for
argument
before
the
three-judge
court
for
our
convenience
and
ordered
consolidated
for
argument
here
for
convenience
of
the
court.
and
i
wanted
to
make
that
particular
observation,
because
there
are
certain
defenses
both
in
equity
and
law.
and
certain
constitutional
defenses
that
the
registrars
or
voters
claimed
they're
entirely
different
from
those
of
the
individuals
who
are
in
the
other
lawsuit.
i
want
to
say
this,
at
the
outset
that
we
have
no
quarrel
whatsoever,
with
the
commission's
right
to
investigate.
we
have
no
quarrel
whatsoever,
with
their
right
to
determine
facts
or
patterns.
what
we
do
have
quarrel
with
is
the
fact
that
when
an
administrative
agency
or
fact-finding
body,
or
whatever
you
call
it,
turns
out
to
be
an
accusatory
body,
that
the
persons
who
are
under
compulsion
and
who
are
subpoenaed
to
testify,
have
the
traditional
safeguards
which
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
constitution
gives
to
them,
and
the
other
amendments
give
to
them.
and
that
congress,
itself,
when
it
created
the
commission
on
civil
rights,
had
no
authority
to
waive
those
safeguards,
unless
it
was
expressly
stated
in
the
particular
act.
now,
that
is
the
position
that
the
registrars
or
voters
states.
and
i
say
that
regardless
of
how
idealistic
and
how
wonderful
the
motives
of
the
commission
maybe,
and
how
fast
they
have
to
act
to
determine
these
particular
rights,
that
that
is
no
excuse
to
disregard
the
right
of
cross-examination,
apprisal,
confrontation
and
the
traditional
safeguards
that
are
so
inherent
in
our
justice
and
in
our
system
of
justice.
and
that
is
why
this
particular
suit
was
filed
and
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
sought
in
the
western
district
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
and
it
was
because
of
the
absence
of
those
traditional
safeguards
and
the
harm
that
would
come
to
the
reputation
of
these
registrars
which
is
something
that
is
basic
in
our
democracy.
because
of
that
irreparable
damage
that
the
western
district
gave
us
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
placed
this
case
before
a
three-judge
court
on
the
issue
of
constitutionality,
of
the
creation
of
the
commission
itself.
and
let
me
say
herein
now,
that
the
order
or
the
judgment
of
the
western
district
of
louisiana
did
not
stop
the
commission
from
operating
in
any
respect.
it
only
said
that
you
cannot
subpoena
these
registrars
and
force
them
to
testify
until
you
give
them
the
right
of
cross-examination,
apprisal,
confrontation,
and
the
traditional
safeguards.
all
of
the
other
witnesses
that
the
commission
had
it
in
shreveport
could
have
been
heard
and
we
would've
had
no
objection.
in
fact,
they
could
have
conducted
their
hearing
even
with
those
registrars,
if
they
had
complied
with
the
court
order
and
given
them
the
right
of
cross-examination
and
the
other
rights
that
i'm
referring
to.
and
in
this
particular
argument,
i'll
refer
to
them
as
the
traditional
safeguards
for
--
in
order
to
conserve
time.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
now,
we
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
was
a
conflict
between
federal
law
and
the
--
this
particular
act
and
the
louisiana
act,
of
which
the
commission
was
well
aware
from
the
inception
of
this
controversy.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
will
come
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
louisiana
law
says
that
records
of
a
registrar
or
voter
can
only
be
inspected
by
a
registered
voter
of
that
particular
parish.
they
maybe
copied
upon
the
application
of
25
registered
voters
of
the
particular
parish
or
photograph
and
so
forth,
and
failure
to
comply
with
that
particular
statute
of
louisiana,
results
in
a
criminal
penalty.
we
advised,
colonel
rosenfeld
of
the
commission.
we
advised
mr.
tiffany
of
this
particular
conflict
and
we
asked
them
that
they
meet
with
us
in
an
error
of
agreement,
but
they
chose
to
disabort
--
they
chose
to
avoid
that
and
to
go
right
ahead
and
hold
their
hearing.
and
that's
what
i
was
coming
to
as
to
actually
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
because
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
act
was
on
the
statute
--
has
been
on
statutes
of
louisiana.
its
absence
the
constitution
of
1921
and
has
been
passed
on
by
our
courts
and
our
supreme
court
on
several
occasions,
as
being
a
law
of
louisiana.
now
what
--
what
i
want
to
come
to
are
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
because
they
are
very,
very
important.
every
session
of
this
court
that
--
that
it
is
held
by
the
supreme
court,
you
are
called
upon
to
pass
upon
these
basic
human
rights,
which
is
so
dear
to
our
democracy.
and
in
each
instance,
you
have
gone
carefully
into
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
to
determine
whether
those
rights
were
violated
or
not.
now,
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
i'm
not
going
to
go
over
them
because
they
are
contained
in
my
affidavit
which
is
found
at
page
142
of
the
record
and
the
subsequent
correspondence
which
is
attached
thereto.
you
will
note
that
in
january,
mr.
tiffany
came
to
louisiana.
we
had
a
very
pleasant
conference.
i
advised
him
of
every
act
of
the
state
of
louisiana
with
reference
to
the
registration
of
voters.
he
told
me
that
he
saw
no
particular
reason
why
we
should
have
a
disagreement
and
that
they
would
investigate,
and
that
they
had
particular
complaints
that
charge
these
registrars
with
depriving
certain
individuals.
and
incidentally,
i
might
say
this,
that
i
learned
more
about
the
proposed
hearing
that
was
scheduled
to
be
in
shreveport
today
than
i
could
ever
find
out
from
the
commission
or
any
of
its
representatives.
i
wish
that
we
have
had
that
information
in
shreveport.
we
may
have
been
better
able
to
have
chartered
our
course
and
necessarily
proceed
with
judicial
dignity
for
an
application
for
a
restraining
order
but
we
never
had
that
information
much
of
that
today.
today
was
the
first
time
that
we
found
out
that
negroes
were
the
only
complainants.
the
--
the
subpoena
which
was
served
upon
these
registrars
says,
that
certain
persons
have
been
deprived
of
the
right
to
register
and
vote
by
virtue
of
race,
creed
or
color.
we
didn't
know
whether
they
were
white,
black,
yellow,
red
or
green.
we
didn't
know
that
until
today.
and
we
don't
know
yet
whether
they
were
just
on
a
right
to
register
or
whether
it
may
have
been
for
religious
reasons
or
others.
in
other
words,
all
of
these
information
was
kept
away
from
us.
as
a
result
of
our
conferences,
mr.
tiffany
told
me
that
they
would
investigate
all
of
these
particular
complaints
and
that
after
this
inquiry,
after
this
particular
investigation,
if
they
decided
to
hold
a
hearing,
they
would
certainly
do
so.we
both
met
that
with
our
governor
during
the
conference
of
the
national
association
of
attorney
generals
at
which
i
was
host
in
new
orleans.
we
met
with
our
governor.
we
decided
then
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
have
these
interrogatories.
well,
naturally,
we
thought
that
the
interrogatories
would
be
pertinent.
that
they
would
be
related
to
the
particular
accusations
or
the
complaints
that
the
commission
had
received
in
which
they
were
authorized
to
receive
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
by
the
commission
to
the
registrars.
and
we
received
315
interrogatories
which
reminds
me
of
a
government
addition
of
a
(inaudible)
catalog
that
has
all
kinds
of
questions
in
there
that
calls
for
opinions,
that
calls
for
matters
entirely
unrelated
to
the
subject
matter
of
such
a
fact-finding
as
the
commission
chose
to
assert.
many
of
those
questions
were
certainly
incriminating.
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
answer
those
particular
interrogatories
and
then
have
that
particular
information
at
a
hearing,
because
slander,
incriminatory
remarks
and
--
and
other
things
could
have
crept
into
there,
which
would
have
violated
these
registrars'
rights.
and
besides,
and
i
assure
this
court
that
i
was
trying
to
cooperate
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
and
that
i
did.
and
besides,
the
conditioned
precedent
for
us
--
on
the
receipt
of
the
interrogatories
was
that
they'd
be
absent
in
10
days.
and
number
two,
that
after
the
receipt
of
the
interrogatories,
the
commission
would
hold
a
hearing
anyway,
if
in
his
judgment,
it
decided
to
do
so.
yet,
counsel
would
have
--
you
believe
that
they
were
trying
not
to
have
a
hearing
and
they
want
us
to
answer
interrogatories
what
i
say
as
--
i
mean
the
registrars
to
answer
interrogatories.
and
then
if
they
decide
the
whole
hearing,
they
will
continue
to
do
so.
in
other
words,
hold
the
hearing
for
what?
exposure
purely
for
exposure's
sake,
because
the
commission
investigates
these
complaints.
it
determines
what
the
facts
and
the
patterns
are
and
they
have
done
exactly
that
in
this
particular
case,
because
as
a
result
of
these
complaints,
they
have
determined
the
facts
and
have
published
to
report,
which
says
that
i
didn't
cooperate,
which
is
not
so,
which
accuses
louisiana
of
bringing
a
road
block,
which
is
not
so.
and
which
even
contains
slander
--
slanderous
remarks
about
the
lack
of
cooperation
of
federal
judge
dawkins
and
the
western
district
court.
of
course,
that's
done.
we
can't
do
anything
about
that.
but
that's
an
example
of
what
we've
been
faced
with
in
the
handling
of
these
particular
facts,
and
then,
in
my
negotiations
with
mr.
tiffany,
over
whether
to
answer
the
interrogatories
or
not
and
all
that's
right
in
this
record.
he
says,
“well
if
you
have
an
objection
so
stated.”
but
then
there
was
a
release
that
came
up
from
the
commission
from
washington
which
said,
that
the
commission
was
going
to
hold
a
hearing
in
louisiana
anyway.
so
we
just
took
the
attitude,
well,
if
you're
going
to
have
for
hearing,
come
on
let's
have
the
hearing
and
get
it
over
with.
and
as
i
said
before,
we
had
no
objection
to
a
hearing.
but
a
hearing
how,
according
to
rules
of
the
commission,
rules
which
were
not
authorized
by
congress,
rules
which
were
adopted
in
the
form
of
a
resolution,
and
in
the
midst
of
all
these
controversy,
the
commission
adopted
a
resolution
in
atlanta
as
follows,
“the
commission
from
his
first
meeting
forward,
having
considered
all
complaints
submitted
to
it
as
confidential,
because
such
confidentiality
is
essential
in
carrying
out
the
statutory
duties
of
the
commission.
the
staff
director
is
hereby
instructed
not
to
disclose
the
names
of
the
complainants
or
other
information
contained
in
the
complaints
to
anyone
except
the
members
of
the
commission
and
members
of
the
staff
assigned
to
process
study
or
investigate
such
complaints.”
i
defy
anyone
in
this
courtroom
to
show
me
why
congress
authorized
such
a
resolution,
or
such
a
policy-making
part
on
the
part
of
the
commission,
it
is
not
in
the
act.
the
act
says
that
they
will
investigate
right
here,
that
they
will
investigate
allegations
in
writing,
under
oath
or
affirmation,
that
certain
citizens
are
being
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote.
the
commission
also
adopted
rules,
the
same
ones
that
are
in
the
act,
which
we
say
are
not
sufficient
and
which
congress
did
not
have
the
authority
to
do
because
it
didn't
go
far
enough.
in
other
words,
congress
committed
a
“boo-boo.”
number
3,
on
page
3
of
these
rules,
“in
addition
to
the
statutory
of
provisions,
the
commission
has
adopted
the
following
supplemented
rules
or
procedure,”
and
then
they
go
on
with
quite
a
few
“which
gives
the
commission
discretionary
features,
which
gives
them
judicial
finding
features,
which
gives
them
adjudicatory
features,
which
gives
them
the
right
to
subpoena.
and
we
were
talking
a
minute
ago
by
the
testimony
in
executive
session.
you
can
only
get
one
if
the
commission
decides
to
give
you
one.
that's
in
the
rules
and
only
if
you
pay
the
cost
of
it.
there's
no
positive
statement
that
the
commission
has
got
to
give
you
one,
upon
request.
and
then
they
come
down
and
in
g,
they
say,
any
witness
desiring
to
read
the
prepared
statement
has
got
to
submit
more
than
24
hours.
and
then
they
would
decide
after.
the
commission
will
decide,
well,
if
they'll
read
or
not.
discretion
again,
policy
again,
which
is
not
authorized
by
congress,
the
commission
shall
decide
whether
written
statements
or
documents
submitted
to
it
shall
be
placed
in
the
record.
again,
the
right
to
judge,
we
could've
placed
all
kinds
of
written
statements
in
there,
100.
and
the
commission
says
well,
no,
we're
not
going
to
put
that
in
there,
because
we
alone
reserve
the
right
to
determine
the
facts.
they
could
take
the
testimony
of
one
man
as
against
100
witnesses
that
we
might
present.
now,
they
might
let
us
present
them.
and
at
the
hearing
in
shreveport,
let
me
say
that
it
was
for
one
day.
it
was
a
public
hearing.
24
witnesses
were
subpoenaed
by
the
united
states
marshal,
under
compulsory
process.
the
ballots
of
the
witness
were
subpoenaed
by
the
commission's
own
investigators.
again,
a
design
of
secrecy,
again,
a
stark
chamber
proceeding,
where
we
had
no
idea
of
the
charges
that
we
were
going
--
these
registrars
we're
going
to
be
faced
with.
we
had
no
intention
what
it
was
about.
we
could
prepare
no
defense,
even
under
the
rules
of
the
commission.
so
how
could
we,
in
all
fairness,
and
with
the
traditional
safeguards,
that
these
registrars
are
entitled
to,
who
are
reputable
people,
most
of
them
ladies,
honest
citizens
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
and
the
law
has
to
assume
that
they
are
doing
their
duties,
unless
it
be
to
the
contrary.
and
with
the
benefit
of
that
assumption,
and
with
the
benefit
of
the
assumption
of
innocence
until
proven
guilty.
how
could
we
defend
these
particular
registrars
in
any
sense
of
fairness
or
in
any
sense
of
justice?
and
yet,
the
commission
says
that
they
want
to
develop
the
facts
objectively,
in
order
to
make
a
report
and
to
set
a
pattern.
this
record
is
replete,
with
cooperation
on
my
part
in
the
board
of
registration.
where
if
any
registrar
was
not
doing
his
duty
as
prescribed
under
louisiana
statutes,
we
wanted
to
know
about
it,
because
we
would
fire
them
and
we
would
prosecute
them.
the
people
that's
on
our
brief
of
counsel
here,
of
the
district
attorneys
to
the
various
districts
and
these
particular
parishes,
they're
honest
people.
they
wanted
to
find
out
the
facts
too,
but
every
time
we
turned
around,
we
were
met
with
secrecy.
we
were
met
that
authority.
develop
is
a
result
of
policy
decisions
of
the
commission,
which
were
not
authorized
by
congress.
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
the
denial
of
a
right
to
cross-examination
and
to
have
these
particular
privileges,
the
act
of
congress
creating
that
administrative
agency
must
to
be
expressed.
that
is
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
we
say
governs
the
conduct
and
the
affairs
of
this
commission,
because
congress
created
the
administrative
procedure
act,
healed
it
to
eliminate
overzealous
administrators,
such
as
the
commission
here.
well,
what
the
commission
wants
to
do,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
say
come
on
down
in
louisiana,
we're
going
to
be
nice
and
good
friends,
but
what's
a
little
constitutional
guarantees
among
friends?
i
can't
hold
that
right.
i've
got
to
protect
the
registrars.
that's
my
duty
as
prescribed
by
my
legislature.
coming
back
to
these
rulings
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
would've
been
--
that's
at
all
because
congress
has
had
authority.
but
congress
does
not
have
the
authority
to
give
the
executive
committee
powers
to
legislate.
and
powers
which
it
cannot
do
because
the
separation
of
powers
of
it.
but
congress
didn't
do
that
though,
they
chose
to
proceed
in
this
particular
matter.
and
that,
of
course
--
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
only
thing
that
we
have
quarrel
with
is
the
conduct
that
the
commission,
in
making
this
an
accusatory
body,
where
these
registrars
are
deprived
or
allegedly
depriving
individuals
of
the
right
to
register
and
subsequently
vote
which
is
a
violation
of
federal
law
and
which
is
a
violation
of
state
law.
and
further
--
but
let
me
go
just
little
further
please,
sir.
and
further,
the
rules
that
they
have
adopted
which
were
not
authorized
by
congress
or
implied
by
congress
and
which
rules
specifically
prohibit
cross-examination
and
which
was
admitted
by
the
commission
itself.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
is
one
of
my
own
positions.
and
that's
absolutely
correct
and
the
other
position
was
that
congress
had
no
authority.
it
did
not
authorize
this
commission
to
adopt
these
particular
rules
which
denied
these
traditional
safeguards
that
this
agency
comes
under
the
administration
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
that
the
commission's
hands
were
not
tied,
as
they
say
they
were.
because
the
only
things
that
were
enjoined
from
doing
were
holding
a
hearing
in
which
these
registrars
were
going
to
be
suspects.
and
they
could
still
hold
a
hearing,
if
they
gave
them
those
particular
safeguard.
now,
that's
actually
the
meat
of
the
coconut.
and
that's
what
the
facts
in
this
case
come
to.
and
let
me
show
you
--
where
is
this
stipulation
here,
which
was
filed
between
the
government
and
myself,
as
attorney
for
the
registrars.
on
page
169,
the
commission
on
civil
rights
received
67
written
allegations
prior
to
february
the
27th
under
oath
or
affirmation,
from
certain
citizens
and
so
forth,
and
that
they
had
been
deprived
of
their
right
to
vote
because
of
color,
race,
religion,
and
national
origin.
and
that
these
were
received
sometime
prior
to
february
27th,
a
number
of
which
alleged
generally
that
the
plaintiffs
in
suit.
and
that
--
that's
the
appellees
here,
the
registrars
through
their
acts
and
deeds
had
caused
such
deprivation.
immediately,
that
makes
them
suspects.
that
accuses
them
of
violating
the
law.
and
then
the
next
allegation
in
this
stipulation
that
after
the
commission
received
these
--
after
the
commission
on
civil
rights
received
these
complaints,
investigators
of
the
commission
was
sent
to
the
state
of
louisiana
and
investigated
the
same.
now,
that
is
admitted.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
and
those
facts
have
to
be
kept
in
mind
when
you
--
when
you
consider
the
rights
that
these
registrars
here
assert.
and
those
facts,
takes
this
case
away
from
groban
and
takes
it
away
from
anonymous.
because
in
groban,
the
--
the
court
there
was
--
that
is
--
instead
that
that
was
a
private
hearing.
this
was
to
be
a
public
hearing.
in
groban,
it
was
a
private
hearing
which
was
authorized
by
an
ohio
statute
of
some
30
years
standing,
which
had
declared
it
to
be
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
ohio.
and
they
were
not
suspects
in
groban.
all
the
fire
marshal
was
trying
to
do
was
to
investigate
causes
of
fires.
but
here,
we
have
investigated
the
complaints.
and
they
say
that
these
complaints
deprived
these
people
of
certain
rights
to
register
and
it
then
--
it
becomes
accusatory.
and
--
and
i
--
i'm
not
arguing
with
groban,
i
have
no
--
i
have
no
quarrel
with
groban
or
anonymous,
but
i
just
say
that
they
are
not
applicable
to
the
particular
facts
here,
because
here,
they
had
conducted
an
investigation
as
in
groban.
and
now,
they
were,
by
compulsory
process,
bringing
these
registrars
to
find
out
from
them
through
their
acts
and
deeds
why
they
deprive
these
particular
individuals
of
their
right
to
vote
which
is
a
violation,
as
i
said
before,
of
federal
and
state
law.
and
in
anonymous,
and
--
and
i
might
say
that
--
i
might
say
here,
that
in
groban,
this
is
a
distinguishing
feature
of
groban
in
--
in
my
humble
opinion.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
“if
ohio
legislature
would
directly,
explicitly
or
by
obvious
design
to
have
secret
inquisition
of
those
suspected
of
arson,
we
would
have
a
wholly
different
situation
from
the
one
before
us.”
this
is
not
a
statute
directed
to
the
examination
of
suspects.
the
aim
of
the
statute
is
expeditious
and
expert
ascertainment
of
the
causes
of
fire.
and
in
anonymous,
there
they
were
determining
not
attorneys,
they
were
determining
the
activities
of
ambulance
chases,
under
a
statute
or
a
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
mr.
justice
harlan
wrote
that
opinion.
and,
of
course,
they
said,
“that
as
a
result
of
the
authority
of
groban,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
said
groban
is
controlling
here.”
and
the
constitutional
claims
are
far
less
terrible
than
in
groban,
because
the
proceedings
were
conducted
by
an
experienced
judge.
in
other
words,
groban
and
anonymous
have
no
application
here.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
--
but
greene
versus
mcelroy
is
the
controlling
case.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
fourteenth
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
fifth,
the
sixth
and
the
fourteenth.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
what's
that?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
because
they're
denying
of
due
process
of
law,
which
is
their
right
to
save
their
name
and
their
reputation
and
their
job.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
don't
follow
you.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
i
see.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
the
court
below
said
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
because
they
considered
the
rules
of
the
commission
not
authorized
by
congress
and
as
such
ultra
vires
and
of
no
effect.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
entirely.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
lack
of
(voice

--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
(voice

--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
more
or
less,
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
yes,
i
follow
you,
now.
pardon
me,
i
--
i
apologize,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
both,
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment,
very
much
so.
because
you
see,
it
wasn't
up
to
congress
to
give
these
traditional
safeguards
or
guarantees,
when
it
passed
the
civil
rights
act.
those
guarantees
already
existed
under
the
constitution
and
congress
could
not
violate
them.
and
congress
could
not
do
it,
and
if
it
did
so,
it
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
yes.
but
then,
a
--
they
have
the
authority
to
legislate.
a
congressional
committee
would
have
that
particular
authority
to
legislate
because
that
is
their
right
as
a
creature
of
congress.
but
they
cannot
delegate
that
particular
authority
to
an
administrative
agency
set
up
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
we
would've
had
entirely
different
act,
now,
i'm
pretty
sure.
i
mean
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
would've
had
an
entirely
different
act.
i
mean
(voice

--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
would
--
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
act.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
but
i
say
that
would
have
been
an
entirely
different
situation.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
i'm
sure
that
it
would
have.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
no.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
absolutely
not
--
absolutely
not.
but
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
i
didn't
mean
to
--
i
did'nt
mean
when
i
was
talking
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
i
didn't
--
--
be
perfectly
all
right.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i've
--
i
said
this.
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
have
a
committee
to
investigate
those
matters
with
which
it
has
a
right
to
legislate.
and
that
congress,
any
committee
of
congress,
can
no
more
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
individuals
than
anyone
else.
but
the
situation
would
be
far
more
different
with
the
congressional
committee,
because
then
that
congressional
committee
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
facts,
just
as
the
commission
on
civil
rights,
with
which
we
have
no
particular
quarrel.
but
if
it
had
been
a
congressional
committee,
we
would
certainly
have
attempted
the
same
relief
before
the
courts
that
we
had
--
they
have
attempted
to
do
the
same
thing
as
this
commission,
we
had
--
we
would've
attempted
the
same
relief
in
louisiana
courts.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
if
--
if
the
committee
had
done
exactly
what
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
commission
had
done
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i'm
very
sorry.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i'm
very
sorry.
that
sort
of
comes
back,
as
i
said,
the
--
the
facts
in
this
case,
now,
i
want
to
bring
out
one
other
thing
that's
very
important
here.
there's
quite
a
bit
difference
between
an
investigation
and
a
hearing,
and
a
hearing
in
equity
and
a
trial
by
law
or
synonymous.
we're
not
complaining
about
the
investigation.
the
commission
has
that
right.
as
this
stipulation
and
as
the
fact
shows,
this
investigation
has
been
complete.
now,
a
hearing
of
an
adversary
nature
has
come
up
before
an
administrative
agency.
and
we
--
yes
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
mean
the
same
thing,
mr.
justice.
i
mean
that
--
that
here
we
have
a
hearing,
which
to
all
extents
and
proportions,
would
be
a
trial.
they
have
--
they
have
been
accused
of
violating
the
law,
of
depriving
these
people
who
say
that
they
are
qualified
to
register
and
not
letting
them
register.
and
they
were
going
to
put
witnesses
on
to
prove
that
particular
charge.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
before
this
commission
on
civil
rights.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
they
have
the
power
to
decide,
because
in
the
--
in
the
rules
--
in
--
in
the
rules,
they
say
“in
the
discretion
of
the
commission,
witnesses
may
submit
brief
and
pertinent
sworn
statements.
the
commission
is
the
sole
judge
of
the
pertinency
of
the
testimony
and
the
evidence
adduced
at
its
hearing.”
and
i
might
say
that
even
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
wisdom,
who
incidentally
--
he
--
he
just
dissented
on
account
of
the
groban
case.
he
said,
“if
groban's
right,
i'm
right.
if
groban's
wrong,
groban's
wrong.”
and
he
overlooked
the
distinction
between
the
facts
here
and
the
distinction
which
i
hope
i've
made
to
this
particular
court.
let
me
read
you
what
judge
wisdom
said
on
page
264,
“a
rob
in
this
case
comes
from
the
act
itself.
it
comes
from
the
infra
congruity
of
a
legislative
commission
of
inquiry,
investigating
specific
complaints
against
individuals
accused
of
crimes.”
to
my
mind,
the
creation
of
such
a
commission
is
a
questionable
legislative
propriety
at
best.
it
carries
grave
danger
of
legislative
usurpation
(inaudible).
the
investigation
of
specific
violations
of
law
is
for
grand
juries,
not
legislative
commissions.
and
on
that
point,
i
might
add
right
here,
mr.
justice
black,
let
me
tell
you
that
--
that
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
in
the
grand
jury,
they
only
investigate
and
determine
whether
a
bill
of
indictment
will
be
presented,
which
is
the
same
thing
that
the
commission
did,
when
they
investigated
these
particular
complaints.
with
all
deference
to
congress
or
commission
constituted
to
investigate
a
broad
problem
of
national
interest
has
no
business
holding
hearings
that
must
inevitably
develop
into
legislative
trials
of
individuals.
when
a
subpoenaed
witness
accused
of
a
crime
maybe
subjected
to
trial
by
exposure,
a
fact-finding
determination
and
punishment,
he
should
have
the
same
rights
of
notice,
confrontation
and
cross-examination
and
all
the
other
hard-earned
rights
embodied
in
due
process.
that
anyone
accused
of
breaking
the
law
is
entitled
to,
when
he
is
tried
by
a
jury
before
a
judge.
that
goes
on
a
little
further,
then
since
the
house
“fair
play”
rules
or
a
step
in
the
proper
direction.
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
government
said
that
they
adopted
the
house
“fair
play”
rules.
we
say
that
that's
not
sufficient.
the
house
“fair
play”
rules
are
step
in
the
proper
direction
for
congressional
committees.
procedure
suitable
for
congress,
old
committees
however,
or
less
than
adequate
for
a
trial
by
an
autonomous
commission
to
which
congress
has
delegated
its
power
of
inquiry.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
not
to
my
knowledge.
that
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
and
incidentally,
there's
a
book
on
that
by
mr.
telford
taylor.
it's
not
in
the
record
i
just
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
might
mention
that
when
he
--
are
you
familiar
with
that
book
and
he
makes
that
statement
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
by
himself.
it
used
to
be
a
serious
thing,
mr.
justices.
when
you
have
--
a
--
an
in
--
fact-finding
group
or
an
investigatory
body
such
as
a
commission
on
civil
rights
that
comes
forward
in
zealous
nature
and
assumes
prerogatives
of
the
judiciary.
that
is
why
congress
was
so
careful
to
pass
the
administrative
procedures
act,
was
to
protect
individuals
and
to
protect
state
officials
against
such
a
practice.
and,
of
course,
we
contend
that
this
commission
makes
rules.
we
contend
that
it
--
that
it
adjudicates
in
its
findings,
its
facts,
that
it
actually
performs
functions
of
the
judiciary
and
is
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
might
say
this
in
closing.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
how
is
that?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
right.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
and
--
and
it,
itself,
is
the
sole
judge
of
the
pertinency
of
that
testimony
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
to
produce
rebuttal
testimony.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
our
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
the
lack
of
the
authority
of
congress
to
expressly
provide
that
this
commission
could
operate
in
the
manner
that
it
is
functional.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
right.
and
that's
the
question
that
this
court
has
to
decide.
that's
the
question
that
it
is
decided
by
the
lower
court.
and
the
lower
court
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
sir,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
right.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct,
correct.
we're
relying
that
the
--
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
--
the
cases,
of
course,
the
law,
i
know
is
known
of
this
court,
the
cases
of
watkins
versus
u.s.,
morgan
versus
u.s.,
joint
anti-fascist
committee
versus
mcgrath,
and
emphasized
and
reiterated
in
the
latest
expression
of
this
honorable
court,
in
greene
versus
mcelroy.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
because
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
congress
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
congress
provided,
when
it
enacted
the
civil
rights
act,
to
settle
rules
of
procedure,
many
of
which
are
violated
in
our
opinion
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment.
it
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
it
did
not
--
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
102
(c)
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
102
(c)
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
just
a
minute,
mr.
justice.
i
had
another
act.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
just
a
minute,
i
have
in
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
102
(c),
“witnesses
maybe
accompanied
by
their
own
counsel
for
the
purpose
of
advising
them
concerning
their
constitutional
rights.”
we
say
that's
not
sufficient.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
because
now,
in
itself,
it
--
it
may
appear
to
be
all
right.
but
when
you
consider
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
that
here,
we
have
registrars
or
voters
who
were
accused
of
a
crime.
that
then
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
right.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
that's
just
it,
mr.
justice
black.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
that
authorized
the
adoption
of
supplemental
rules
of
the
implication
of
these
particular
rules.
the
act
is
completely
silent.
and
mr.
white,
when
we
argued
this
case
in
the
lower
court,
admitted
that.it's
silent
either
way.
that's
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
after
--
after
this
act
was
created,
the
commission
met
and
then
implemented
these
specific
rules
with
the
adoption
of
other
rules.
one
of
which,
in
particular,
said
that
interrogation
of
the
witnesses
would
be
only
by
the
--
a
member
of
the
commission's
staff
or
by
a
member
of
the
commission.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
specifically
denied
the
right
of
cross-examination.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
absolutely
and
they
admit
it.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct,
because
it
cannot
be
read
into
it
by
implementation.
it
cannot
be
implied.
it
cannot
be
written
into
it
by
implication.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
that
is
one
of
my
contentions,
very
much
so.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
that,
of
course
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
that,
of
course,
is
--
was
the
holding
of
the
court
in
greene
versus
mcelroy.
these
particular
boards
and
commissions
had
adopted
a
security
program
of
their
own,
which
was
not
authorized
by
congress
and
which
was
not
authorized
by
the
act.
and
--
and
again,
i
come
back
--
you've
come
to
that,
i
say
there's
nothing
in
the
act
and
you
can
search
it
in
vain
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
that
gave
the
commission
that
particular
power.
and
without
that
particular
power,
they
have
no
authority
to
implement
or
supplement
these
particular
rules.
that
--
that
was
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
how
is
that?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
the
only
other
commissions
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
only
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
that
comes
back,
mr.
justice
black,
to
what
i
have
said
before
about
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
growth
of
the
administrative
agencies
is
--
is
apparent
in
our
history
today.
and
we
have
many
administrative
agencies
which
perform
functions.
and
to
prevent
the
violation
of
individual
rights,
congress
adopted
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
set
a
national
policy.
and
that
policy
was
that
the
basic
traditional
safeguards
and
rights
had
to
be
given
to
an
individual
before
any
administrative
body
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i'm
referring
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
it's
in
the
brief.
i'll
find
it
for
you
in
just
a
second.
it's
at
page
29,
30,
31,
through
34
of
our
brief.
you
see
when
congress
had
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i'm
relying
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
i
will,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
where
is
that
in
the
--
in
that
act
of
mr.
dawson?
it's
5
u.s.c.
101.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
1011
and
here
--
here's
what
it
says,
“no
subsequent
legislation
shall
be
held
--
it's
on
page
32,
“supersede
a
modified

of
this
chapter,
except
to
the
extent
that
such

so
expressly
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
expressly
exempts
this
commission
from
the
applicability
of
the
administrative

i
don't
have

so
forth

to

for

were
going

which
is

“hearings,

page

(a)
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.

yes.
that's
--
that's
true,
but
you
look
at
1004
it
says
persons
--
it
says
notice
of
hearings
and
the
issues
and
so
forth
and
it
sets
forth
on

the
type
of
hearing.
so
it
covers
all
of
them
your
honor.
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
we
contend
that
it
is,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
is
true.
but
in
morgan
versus
united
states
and
greene
versus
mcelroy,
they
held
where
an
administrative
agency
became
an
accusatory
body
or
it
actually
came
into
the
trial.
where
this
evidence
showed
that
these
registrars
were
violating
the
law
and
that
they
did
not
have
the
traditional
safeguards,
they
could
be
prosecuted
by
the
department
of
justice.
they
could
be
prosecuted
by
louisiana
law.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
it
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
it
adjudicates
on
evidence.
it
adjudicates
on
the
pertinency
of
the
evidence.
it
adjudicates
on
who
will
be
heard.
it
adjudicates
of
whether
you'll
be
given
a
copy
of
the
record.
they
are
numerous
places
in
this
particular
act
where
the
commission
by
its
own
rules
that
it
adopted,
adjudicates
and
affects
the
rights
of
individuals.
there
--
there's
enumerable
instance
and
we
have
pointed
that
out.
it
--
it
adjudicates
in
these
findings
of
facts,
because
it
determines
what
facts
it's
going
to
report
or
not.
it
is
even
suggested
in
this
report
legislation,
legislation
which
is
presently
being
considered
before
a
senate
committee
on
capitol
hill,
right
now.
it
has
exceeded
its
authority
in
that
particular
fact.
and
that's
why
we
keep
saying
that
--
we
keep
saying
that
it
adjudicates
and
it
subjects
to
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
let
me
show
you
on
page
101.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
it
says,
“the
testimony
which
complaining
witnesses
had
been
prepared
to
offer
at
the
shreveport's
hearing,
plus
the
commission's
own
field
investigations,
indicated
three
major
techniques
of
voting
denial.”
now,
if
that's
not
adjudicating.
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
first
judge
dawkins
said
that
it
was,
when
he
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order,
he
said
that
it
--
that
it
was
applicable.
and
then
later,
he
changed
his
mind.
and,
of
course,
we
disagree
with
that
because
we
think
that
they
were
under
misapprehension
of
the
facts
as
it
applied
actually
to
the
administrative
procedure
act,
itself.
but
what
the
court
below
did,
as
i'm
sure
you're
well
aware,
it
said
that
the
legislation
was
appropriate
legislation.
it
said
that
the
commission
had
exceeded
its
authority
and
the
rules
were
not
authorized
by
congress.
and
therefore,
they
were
ultra
vires,
and
then
on
the
equities
of
the
thing,
that
probably
natural
justice
might
say
that
in
some
hearings
that
confrontation
and
cross-examination
might
not
be
proper.
but
of
the
hearing
that
was
proposed
in
shreveport
as
developed
by
the
facts
and
the
stipulation
that
that
particular
hearing
--
in
that
particular
hearing
or
a
type
of
that
kind,
under
the
doctrine
of
greene
versus
mcelroy,
these
registrars
were
entitled
to
their
traditional
safeguards.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
[laughs]
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
may
i
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
may
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
to
clear
that
point
up.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
congress
did
give
them
(a)
through
(f),
but
then
the
commission
adopted
and
supplemented
additional
rules
of
its
own,
with
which
we
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
where
is
the
valid
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes,
i
know
that.
i'm
looking
for
the
additional
rules
in
the
--
the
records.
the
--
the
rules
that
congress
adopted
start
on
page
57.
in
addition
to
these
statutory
provisions,
the
commission
has
adopted
the
following
supplemental
rules
of
procedure.
and
it
enlarged
upon
(c)
and
--
and
said
in
--
(i)
that
“interrogation
of
the
witnesses
shall
be
conducted
only
by
members
of
the
commission
or
by
authorized
staff
personnel.”
they
adopted
these
rules
on
july
the
1st,
1958.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
i
said
that
rule
(c)
wasn't
sufficient.
that
it
violated
--
that
for
the
fifth
and
it
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
i
admit
that
and
certainly,
i
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
which
page
is
that
on
--
mr.
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
a
copy
of
the
rules
shall
be
made
available
to
the
witnesses
before
the
commission,
whether
it's
self
explanatory
and
they
did
make
a
copy
of
the
rules
when
they
said
their
subpoena.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
no.
that
--
the
only
way
that
you
could
--
the
only
way
you
could
say
that
would
be
by
implication,
and
we
say
that's
exactly
what
greene
versus
mcelroy
said.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
they
did
give
him
a
copy.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
then
congress
specified
the
rules,
mr.
justice
clark.
it
said
rules
of
procedure.
and
it
says
that
he
will
give
--
everyone
couldn't
have
a
copy
of
this
particular
act.
but
when
they
issued
the
subpoena,
they
said
you
have
to
have
a
copy
of
the
rules.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
it
--
it
--
what
you
referred
to,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
this.
that
if
congress
--
if
the
commission
would've
said,
we
don't
allow
attorney
to
be
present
at
a
hearing
and
if
you're
going
to
have
cross-examination
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
that
you're
going
to
rebut
--
oh,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
they
did
not
do
that.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
--
yes,
but
the
difference
there
would
be
this.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
they
would
be
--
they
would
be
granting
to
us
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
what
we
claim
our
traditional
safeguards.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
they
would
only
be
providing
the
traditional
safeguards
which
are
guaranteed
by
the
amendments
to
the
constitution.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
something
which
the
registrars
were
entitled
to
anyway.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
they
could
--
they
could
say
that
we're
going
to
meet
at
10
o'clock
every
morning
and
that
so
and
so
will
be
chairman
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
think
that
they
could
do
that,
yes.
i
say
to
do.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
of
course
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
mr.
justice
warren,
that
disturbs
me
quite
a
bit.
i
say
that
it's
not
sufficient
for
many
reasons.
and
i
have,
in
mind,
the
case
of
counselman
versus
hitchcock.
for
instance
--
and
--
and
then,
we
come
to
a
discussion
of
the
fifth
amendment.
many
people,
although
unwarranted,
say
that
“where
there's
smoke,
there's
fire,”
if
you
refuse
to
answer
a
question
and
denies
you
the
public,
you're
considered
guilty.
but
at
the
same
time,
congress
didn't
grant
them
the
question
that
--
that
if
they
decided
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
as
to
any
questions
that
this
commission
would
ask,
they
did
not
extend
the
power
of
immunity.
it
maybe
that
a
registrar
could
have
come
in
and
said,
“well,
all
sure,
i've
violating
the
law,
but
i
maybe
prosecuted
for
it,
both
federal
and
by
state
officials.
can
you
give
me
immunity?”
that
is
absent.
it
--
it's
really
a
--
a
unique
situation.
it
honestly
is.
it
--
it's
a
very
unique
situation
and
that's
were
the
many
reasons
why
i
say
that
(c)
does
not
go
far
enough,
that
congress
did
not
provide
the
--
the
right
of
or
denial
of
the
right
of
cross-examination
merely
by
saying
that,
because
congress
did
not
have
that
authority
to
waive
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
way
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
didn't
hear
you,
mr.
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
they
could
plead
the
fifth
amendment,
but
i
say
that
that
is
exactly
--
when
they
start
pleading
the
fifth
amendment
that
that's
when
they
do
harm
to
their
particular
reputation.
because,
although
completely
unwarranted,
the
public
today
as
a
result
of
many
of
these
particular
hearings
on
television
and
so
forth,
take
the
idea
that
where
there's
smoke,
there's
fire,
and
that
when
you
plead
the
fifth
amendment,
they
consider
it
a
--
a
guilt.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
but
i'm
talking
about
public
or
program,
if
your
honor
please
and
scar
and
so
forth,
which
would
--
this
was
the
very
thing
that
we
were
trying
to
protect
because
the
right
to
a
good
name
is
one
of
the
precious
rights
that
we
have
to
protect.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
you
mean,
how
would
i
write
a
rule?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
there
might
not
be
the
necessity
for
pleading
the
fifth
amendment,
if
we
were
given
the
opportunity
of
presenting
witnesses
to
rebut
the
particular
accusations
with
which
they
were
charged.
you
must
bear
in
mind,
mr.
justice
that
we
have
--
we
had
no
idea
what
was
going
to
be
developed
at
this
hearing.
we
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever,
what
the
natures
of
the
complaints
were
or
what
they
were
about.
that
the
hearing
was
a
one-day
hearing,
60
witnesses
were
subpoenaed,
24
were
by
compulsory
process.
the
others
were
kept
secret.
now,
i
might
tell
the
court
something
that
had
happened
just
recently
in
the
case
that
i
had
in
the
federal
district
court
of
louisiana.
we
had
an
individual
who
claimed
that
he
was
discriminated
against
because
he
belonged
to
a
certain
particular
organization.
it
so
happened
that
we
had
about
two
weeks
of
delay
in
the
case
during
the
thanksgiving
holidays
and
we
are
not
here
to
investigate
that
affidavit.
we
checked
into
it
and
find
out
that
he
had
worked
as
a
janitor
at
the
bank.
that
the
bank
had
fired
him
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
poor
janitor.
he
wasn't
doing
his
work
right.
and
he
claimed
that
he
was
discriminated
against.
we
checked
into
his
employment
(inaudible)
we
found
out
that
he
was
working
for
the
state
of
louisiana
as
a
janitor.
so
when
we
had
the
opportunity
to
find
out
this
information
and
we
had
the
opportunity
to
rebut,
we
were
able
to
disprove
those
particular
accusations
such
as
these
registrars
were
faced
here
and
it's
exactly
what
this
court
decided
in
peters
versus
hobby.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
mr.
justice
warren
--
mr.
justice
warren
that
is
not
true.
we
are
not
given
anything,
absolutely
not.
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
provides
that
and
there's
nothing
in
the
rules
of
the
commission
that
apprises
us
of
the
information
and
the
charges
to
which
these
or
the
manner
that
these
registrars
deprive.
and
furthermore,
let
me
say
this.
that
--
that
what
stirs
up
practically
all
of
this
controversy,
here
we
have
a
one
day
hearing.
suppose
we
get
eight
people
from
cattle
parish
who
says
that
the
registrar
in
cattle
parish
has
denied
them
the
right
to
vote,
let's
say,
because
of
a
--
a
literacy
test
or
a
constitutional
test
or
whatever
it
maybe.
now,
how
is
that
registrar
going
to
determine
or
how
is
he
going
to
bring
witnesses
before
that
particular
hearing.
a
one
day
hearing,
how
is
he
going
to
get
the
opportunity
to
bring
in
rebuttal
evidence
to
prove
that
those
particular
witnesses
are
bearing
a
malice
or
a
prejudice,
or
that
they
are
not
telling
the
truth.
that
opportunity
does
not
present
itself.
but
if
we
would
know
those
things
in
advance,
we
would
have
the
opportunity
of
bringing
out
a
full
disclosure
of
the
fact
which
is
the
task
assigned
to
the
commission.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
it
was
--
i
challenge
that.
it
was
not
available
to
them
before
they
take
the
stand
and
the
order
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
“except
as
provided
in
section
102
and
105,
the
chairman
shall
receive
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
that's
one
of
the
rules
that
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
they
adopted.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
“if
the
commission
determines
that
the
evidence
and
testimony
may
tend
to
defame,
degrade
or
incriminate
other
person,
that
shall
advise
such
person
of
such
evidence
has
been
given
and
it
shall
afford
such
person
an
opportunity
to
read
the
pertinent
testimony
and
to
appear
as
voluntary
witness
or
to
file
a
sworn
statement
in
his
behalf.”
well,
of
course,
that's
self-explanatory,
but
were
--
never
were
afforded
that
particular
privilege.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
there
never
was
a
hearing.
but
--
but
the
commission
has
that
right.
it
--
the
commission
is
the
one
that
determines
whether
it
was
defamed,
not
the
person
that
is
accused
of
breaking
the
law.
the
commission
judges
that.
that's
another
thing
that
we
complain
of,
that
they
don't
have
the
authority
to
make
that
judgment.
in
other
words,
if
i
think
the
testimony
is
going
to
defame
me,
i
certainly
in
all
fair
play
in
the
hearing
that's
conducted
fairly,
have
the
opportunity
to
bring
witnesses
in
to
disapprove
it,
because
it
may
vanish
like
bubbles.
and
that's
particularly
true
with
full
testimony.
it
--
it's
bad
enough
with
document
or
the
evidence,
but
with
oral
testimony,
it's
worse.
and
that's
what
this
court
held
in
peters
versus
hobby.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
mr.
justice,
coming
back,
that
is
idealistic.
it
is
not
factual.
that
opportunity
wasn't
even
known
or
afforded
to
us.
do
you
know
when
i
as
--
when
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
louisiana
was
notified
officially
of
the
hearing,
the
letter
received
in
my
office
was
on
july
the
13th,
the
very
day
that
the
hearing
was
to
be
held.
i
even
attempted
to
find
out
for
mr.
tiffany
the
names
of
the
registrars
that
were
going
to
be
subpoenaed.
and
he
had
mr.
rosenfeld
call
my
office
and
there
were
correct.
there
were
others
--
mr.
mitchell,
the
registrar
in
cattle
was
only
subpoenaed
on
the
9th.
i
had
to
write
his
name
in
the
complaint
that
we
filed
in
district
court
with
a
pen.
that's
how
fast
this
thing
was
developing.
as
i
say,
in
idealistic
--
in
ideals
and
in
theory,
this
is
a
wonderful
piece
of
legislation
and
these
motives
are
grant.but
in
its
practical
application,
it
destroys
the
traditional
safeguards
that
are
guaranteed
to
citizens
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
absolutely
not,
i
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to.
we
didn't
even
know,
mr.
justice
clark,
what
that
nature
of
the
hearing
was
going
to
be.
because
these
particular
rule
say,
that
when
the
hearing
is
opened,
the
chairman
of
the
commission
will
state
what
the
hearing
is
about.
so
how
could
we
prepare
for
something
on
a
day
where
witnesses
where
--
would
have
to
be
brought
from
all
over
the
state
of
louisiana,
some
as
far
as
200
miles
away,
how
could
we
prepare
or
how
could
we
even
submit
names
of
witnesses
to
rebut,
when
we
didn't
even
know
what
the
hearing
was
about.
all
we
knew
was
that
it
was
going
to
be
on
the
deprivation
of
the
denial
of
the
right
to
register
and
vote
by
reason
of
race,
color,
creed,
or
religion.
and
that's
the
only
thing
that
we
could
know.
we
--
we
had
no
idea
of
any
individual
charges
and
i
might
say
that
there's
nothing
in
this
act
that
authorize
the
commission's
rule
in
atlanta
on
april
the
14th,
it
said
they're
going
to
keep
these
things
a
secret.
they
say
that
they
might
suffer
some
economic
reprisals.
the
court
below
said
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
said
economic
reprisals
and
i
don't
know
of
any
here,
absolutely
none.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
july
the
13th
in
shreveport.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
is
correct.
but
we
did
not
know
at
that
time
what
witnesses
were
going
to
be
subpoenaed
or
whether
or
not,
any
registrars
would
be
subpoenaed.
it
may
have
been
that
this
commission
would
have
only
discussed
or
heard
from
the
testimony
of
the
sworn
complaints.
and
we
did
not
know,
nor
did
we
have
any
way
of
knowing
that
these
particular
appellees
were
going
to
be
called
as
witnesses
by
compulsory
process,
until
they
were
served
during
the
week
prior
to
the
date
of
the
scheduled
hearing.
and
if
you
will
note,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
the
letter
following
was
written
on
july
the
8th
and
they
asked
me
to
attend.
and
that
was
the
letter
that
i'm
talking
about
that
i
received
on
july
the
13th.
and,
of
course,
the
commission
was
well
aware
that
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
was
the
attorney
for
the
registrars,
because
we
had
furnished
them
with
the
copy
of
that
act
in
our
early
negotiations.
well,
of
course,
i
was
in
shreveport
because
i
had
instructed
these
registrars
that
if
they
were
subpoenaed
to
please
immediately
send
me
a
copy
of
the
subpoena
and
i
can
assure
this
court
that
i
had
a
busy
week.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
of
course,
i
could
really
talk
for
about
two
hours
on
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
come
to
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
--
we
come
to
--
we
come
to
--
on
that
issue,
we
come
to
the
right
of
states
to
determine
qualifications
of
these
voters.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
we
--
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
right
to
vote
or
the
right
for
a
person
to
register.
and
i
certainly
feel
and
i
assert
here
now
that
there
should
be
absolutely
no
discrimination.
unfortunately,
you
have
disturbances
that
come
up
in
political
questions
all
over
the
united
states
and
not
necessarily
confined
to
louisiana.
and
of
course
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
--
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
it
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
that
is
the
way
that
it
should
proceed.
after
all
there
has
been
many
grand
jury
investigations
in
my
own
state,
on
this
same
particular
question.
the
registrar
or
voters
in
ouachita
parish
was
examined
by
a
grand
jury
on
her
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
and
to
discriminate
them
on
an
action
initiated
by
the
justice
department.
she
was
exonerated.
we
also
had
an
action
that
was
filed
in
--
in
monroe,
louisiana
also,
involving
registrars
from
madison
parish
and
from
east
carroll
parish
on
certain
allegations
to
that
effect.
those
particular
registrars
were
exonerated.
and,
of
course,
behind
this,
there
is
still
a
remedy
for
a
--
for
a
registrant
who
claims
that
he
has
been
denied
the
privilege
to
register,
because
--
and
we
have
ample
laws
in
my
state
for
the
protection
of
those
individuals.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
--
we
have
a
law
which
says
that
they
can
file
a
suit
in
a
district
court
that
has
got
to
be
tried
by
summary
process,
within
48
hours
at
no
cost
and
that
the
appeal
--
and
that
there
would
be
no
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
that
particular
court,
so
there
is
ample
redress.
there's
ample
redress
through
the
department
of
justice,
the
attorney
general
and
through
the
state
of
louisiana.
and
bear
in
mind,
i
could
ask
this
commission
time
and
time
again,
tell
us
of
wrong
doing.
we're
just
as
much
interested
in
as
you
are
and
that
for
registrars
who
violated
the
law
or
discriminated
against,
we'll
see
that
they're
fired.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
think
--
i
don't
remember
the
--
the
section
that
judge
walsh
quoted
it
in
his
argument
yesterday.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
you
mean
the
original
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
civil
rights
cases,
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
all
right.
and
my
answer
to
that
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
have
a
statute
in
louisiana
that
says
that
a
registrar
has
to
produce
these
records
upon
order
of
a
competent
court.
now,
i
wrote
a
letter
which
is
at
--
generally,
which
is
at
page
154
to
mr.
campbell
of
minden,
louisiana,
concerning
that
particular
request.
and
i
recognized
the
difference
and
the
conflict
between
louisiana
law
and
the
particular
investigation
that
the
fbi
agent
was
conducting.
and
this
is
what
i
said.
and
this
is
all
then
i
could
say,
“in
conclusion,
it
is
our
opinion
that
until
such
time
that
some
proper
court
holds
unconstitutional,
the
provisions
of
the
revised
statutes
1892,”
which
is
the
provision
i'm
talking
about,
“or
unless
some
court
directs
to
the
contrary,
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
registrar
of
voters
should
adhere
strictly
to
the
louisiana
statute,”
which
they
have
to
do,
because
if
they
don't,
they
again,
are
violating
the
law.
mr.
jack
p.
f.

no.
the
only
thing
it
--
the
judgment
is
in
the
record
and
it
said
that
they
will
--
let's
look
at
it.
it's
261
in
the
record.
no,
it's
not
261.
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
judgment
of
the
court
(inaudible).
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
271,
“it
is
ordered,
the
judge
then
decreed
that
the
defendants,
agents,
service
and
--
servants
and
attorneys
are
enjoined
and
restrained
from
conducting
the
proposed
hearing
in
shreveport,
wherein
plaintiff
registrars
accused
of
depriving
others
of
the
right
to
vote,
would
be
denied
the
right
of
apprisal,
confrontation
and
cross-examination.
this
injunction
does
not
prohibit
all
hearings
pursuant
to
public
law,
so
and
so,”
and
it
cites
the
civil
rights
act,
“but
only
those
hearings
wherein
the
accused
that
denied
the
right
of
apprisal,
confrontation,
and
cross-examination.”
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
under
the
act,
if
--
naturally,
he
didn't
--
the
registrars
did
not
bring
their
records.
they
did
not
comply.
and
we
advised
them
not
to.
and
under
the
act,
of
course,
if
they
had
not
complied,
then
they
would
have
had
the
--
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
and
get
a
court
order
directing
them
to
comply
with
the
subpoena.
and
i
might
say
that
judge
dawkins
stated
in
his
reasons
for
the
temporary
restraining
order
that
if
the
civil
rights
commission
or
the
attorney
general
had
asked
him
for
such
an
order
or
--
or
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
that
he
would
not
have
done
it
until
they
were
given
these
rights.
