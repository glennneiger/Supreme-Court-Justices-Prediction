mr.
w.
m.
shaw
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
shaw,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
our
time
is
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
--
still
run
out.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
had
not
intended
to
and
i'm
reluctant
to
go
outside
of
the
record
in
this
case,
but
a
statement
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
has
caused
me
to
feel
that
i
must
do
so
in
order
to
put
this
case
in
its
proper
context
and
also
to
defend
myself.
i
might
say
that
i
am
the
general
counsel
for
the
joint
legislative
committee
and
was
referred
to
as
one
who
advised
registrars
to
discriminate
against
negroes
in
the
--
when
they
attempted
to
register
the
vote.
i
might
say
that
that
is
just
not
correct
and
i
feel
that
the
deputy
attorney
general
was
misinformed,
he's
acting
erroneously.
to
properly
explain
what
had
happened
in
louisiana,
particularly
in
connection
with
voting
and
let's
say
this
is
not
directly
in
the
record,
but
i
think
the
court
needs
to
know
it,
to
understand
what
have
been
going
on.
we
have
laws
in
louisiana
and
have
--
have
number
of
other
states
which
require
literacy
qualifications,
also,
a
certain
amount
of
intelligence
qualification.
those
laws,
for
many
years,
were
not
enforced.
the
same
is
true
and
most
of
the
other
states
that
have
those
law,
they
are
approximately
15,
as
i
recall.
several
years
back,
we
--
we
the
members
of
my
committee,
in
discussion
with
me,
asked
me
to
look
into
the
situation
on
voter
--
voting
laws
and
recommend
--
make
recommendations
to
them.
as
results
of
the
studies
which
i
have
made,
we
have
instituted
a
program
to
enforce
our
laws
strictly.
that
means
to
white
people
and
as
well
as
to
colored
people.
our
efforts
have
not
been
successful
completely.
we
--
there
have
been
cases
we
know
and
we
have
freely
admitted
that
there
are
many
parishes
in
which
the
colored
people
are
discriminated
against.
also,
there
are
many
parishes
in
which
these
laws
are
enforced
uniformly.
and
the
court
probably
can
recall
the
instances
which
happened
last
summer
in
the
legislature
of
our
state
in
which
the
governor
of
our
state
suffered
a
mental
and
moral
breakdown.
and
that
was
brought
on
by
his
attempt
to
change
our
voter
qualification
laws.
and
his
reasons
for
doing
so
were
because
we
were
removing
from
the
roll,
many,
i
think,
the
term
(inaudible)
all
white
people,”
who
were
the
backbones
of
his
--
his
political
organization.
and
our
reasoning
on
doing
this,
carrying
out
this
program
is
this,
that
we
have
been
plagued
in
louisiana
for
many
years,
like
demagoguery
and
our
political
opposite.
and
we
determined
that
the
only
way
that
we
could
safely
protect
ourselves
against
that
is
by
a
rigid
enforcement
of
our
voter
qualification
law.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
we
have
removed
hundreds,
if
not
thousands.
i
say
we,
not
i
personally,
but
people
who
have
consulted
with
our
committee
and
got
an
advice,
have
challenged
the
legality
of
the
registration
of
white
people
in
many
places.
as
a
matter
fact,
it
resulted
in
one
lawsuit
which
will
eventually
get
to
this
court
in
the
parish
of
st.
landry.
that
happens
to
be
one
of
the
french-speaking
parishes
and
there
are
many
illiterate
white
people
in
that
parish
who
do
not
speak
or
read
english.
it's
going
to
the
attempt
that
was
made
--
started
out,
i
think,
they
removed
several
hundred
of
them,
before
the
registrar
just
tried
to
refuse
to
remove
any
more
because
of
political
exigency
at
the
time.
and
i'm
saying
this
in
order
to
remove
what
i
think
is
an
unfair
prejudice
that
surrounds
this
case.
our
program
that
we
have
been
enforcing
in
our
state
is
aimed
at
improving
our
government
by
enforcing
laws
which
on
the
book
and
which
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
an
effect
upheld
recently
in
north
carolina
when
the
court
refused
certiorari
in
the
case
from
north
carolina
on
their
literacy
qualification.
that
is
all
that
i
want
to
say
in
regard
to
the
background,
but
if
there
are
any
questions,
i'd
be
delighted
to
answer
them
because
i
think
haven't
got
a
personal
knowledge
of
what's
happened
as
any
person
in
our
state.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i'm
the
general
counsel
for
the
joint
legislative
committee.
i'm
also
been
a
special
assistant
attorney
general
to
two
successive
attorney
generals,
mr.
leblanc,
who
was
the
previous
attorney
general
and
in
certain
instances,
mr.
gremillion.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
no,
there
is
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't.
but
of
course,
the
commission
was
not
interested
in
that
faith
and
thing.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well,
the
purpose
of
the
investigations,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
understand
it,
was
to
investigate
certain
sworn
allegations.
those
sworn
complaints
had
to
be
if
it
followed
the
course
of
this
act
based
upon
a
denial
due
to
race
or
religion.
and
what
i'm
saying
about
--
what
i've
been
explaining
is
that
in
the
instances
in
which
we
run
into
trouble
in
our
own
state
had
been
--
when
we
did
not
discriminate.
the
fact
that
we
did
not,
it
caused
us
as
people
in
yield
in
public
life
had
great
deal
of
trouble
in
our
own
state.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
that
is
--
it
would
have
been
--
certainly
would
have
intended
to
counteract
that
and
we
would
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
--
we
were
looking
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
--
to
do.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i'm
sure
they
would
want
to
testify
to
that.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well,
because
they
were
summoned,
subpoenaed
to
appear
and
testify
on
certain
complaints
made
against
them
which
they
did
not
know
the
content.
now,
they
--
we
have
no
objection
to
a
hearing,
in
fact,
we
welcome
the
hearing
provided
we
are
given
the
reasonable
rights
to
protect
ourselves.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
first
of
all,
we
want
to
know
in
advance
of
the
hearing
what
we
are
charged
with,
so
that
we
can
be
prepared
to
present
our
side
when
we
go
there.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
we
are
charged
with
commission
of
crimes
and
also,
the
acts
which
give
rise
to
damage
--
suits
for
damages
because
the
--
the
complaint
required
by
the
act,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
is
a
complaint
that
you
have
been
discriminated
against
someone
on
account
of
their
race,
and
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
discriminate
against
someone
on
account
of
their
race,
for
example,
without
having
an
intent
to
violate
these
--
these
civil
rights
statutes
which
the
court
is
familiar
with
in
which
i'll
be
glad
to
--
to
read
to
you
in
my
brief
at
--
the
original
civil
rights
act
of
1871
which
is
--
provides
statutes
1979
42
u.s.c.
1983
also
the
conspiracy
angle
of
that.
i
might
add
further
that
there's
another
face
of
that
which
bears
upon
what
this
commission
would
have
to
do,
i'd
like
to
read
you
if
the
court
ask
this
--
this
section
which
is
section
6
of
the
old
civil
rights
act
42
u.s.c.
1986,
“every
person
who,
having
knowledge
that
any
of
the
wrong
conspired
to
be
done”
and
mentioned
in
section
1985
of
this
title,
“or
about
to
be
committed
in
having
power
to
prevent
or
aid
in
preventing
the
commission
of
the
same,
neglect
or
refuses
to
do
so,
shall
be
liable
to
the
party
injured
or
his
legal
representative
for
all
damages.”
and
this
commission
investigates
and
finds
that
registrars
are
--
to
their
satisfaction,
that
registrars
are
--
are
doing
something
in
violation
of
this
act,
it
becomes
their
duty
to
assist
in
the
preventing
of
that
and
bringing
little
people
to
justice
under
the
statutes
of
the
united
states.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
may
i
read
you
the
--
the
sentence,
“every
person
too
had
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
this
applies
to
anyone.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
now,
but
--
and
this
would
include
this
commission.
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
a
feature
of
this
commission's
act,
this
is
a
general
statute
which
required
anyone
knowing
about
the
wrongful
conduct
in
this
respect
to
take
steps
to
prevent
it.
otherwise,
they
become
civilly
liable
to
the
party
injured
for
failure
to
do
so.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
knew
that
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
the
individual
would
be
civilly
liable.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
right.
in
my
--
in
my
construction
of
this
act
which,
as
far
as
i
knew
it,
not
been
construed,
it
--
it's
been
practically
no
jurisprudence
with
regard
to
it.
that
is
42
u.s.c.
1986.
it
was
an
act
to
require
people
to
assist
federal
officers
and
others
who
are
trying
to
enforce
the
old
civil
rights
act.
it's
been
on
the
books
and
carried
right
down
to
the
history
of
our
country
since
the
civil
war.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
criminal
feature
of
it,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
which
is
18
u.s.c.
241.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
wasn't
aware
that
there
was
any
limit
on
the
amount
of
liability
in
that
case.
i
thought
that
he
could
get
whatever
damages
he
would
--
he
could
prove.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
would
that
not
be
section
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
believe
that's
--
preceding
sections
2,
it's
the
old
section
of
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
there
are
also
criminal
faces
of
this
which
are
found
under
the
18
u.s.c.
the
criminal
code
241.
and
therefore,
when
the
complaint
has
made
against
a
registrar,
an
individual,
here
is
denying
someone
their
privilege
of
voting
or
right
of
voting,
a
challenge
somewhat
the
use
of
the
word
“right”
although
it's
in
our
--
or
the
fifteenth
amendment
in
--
elsewhere,
when
he
deny
--
when
he
is
charged
with
denying
that
particular
legal
remedy,
legal
right
or
privilege
because
of
race
or
color.
you
automatically
saying
he
has
done
this
thing
intentionally
which
the
willful
feature
is
automatically
included
within
it,
that
is,
for
the
intent
when
you
do
it
on
that
basis.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
because
the
--
because
words
have
different
meaning
but
to
me,
voting
is
a
privilege.
it's
the
highest
privilege
of
the
citizenship
in
--
in
a
representative
type
of
democracy
such
as
we
have.
a
right
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well,
if
--
if
it
were
a
right,
it
would
--
the
state
could
not
deny
it
to
anyone.
if
it's
a
privilege,
the
state
can.
thus,
it
--
if
it's
in
all
states
deny
for
certain
people.
all
states
that
i
know
of
have
certain
age
qualifications
which
in
effect
deny
--
denies
voting
rights
if
you
wish
to
call
it
a
theorem.
and
also
had
--
they
denied
those
rights
to
the
people
who
haven't
resided
there
for
a
period
of
time.
the
right
to
set
these
qualifications
by
the
constitution
is
reserved
to
the
states.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
that
is
--
that
is
true
--
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor.
that
is
a
right
which
is
different
from
the
so-called
right
to
vote.
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
denied
that.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
but
the
--
the
voting
--
the
franchise
itself
is
a
privilege,
as
i
say
it,
not
a
right.
but
the
--
the
protection
against
having
being
deprived
of
it
is
a
right.
now,
to
get
back
to
the
case
itself,
which,
i
think
--
the
court
has
illuminated
to
a
great
extent
by
its
question.
but
in
the
550,
these
private
individuals
who
i'm
representing,
we
base
our
case
on
two
things
only,
the
two
things
that
the
lower
court
reached
its
decision
on.
first,
that
congress
did
not
authorize
explicitly
the
rules
adopted
by
the
commission
which
deprive
us
of
confrontation,
cross-examination
and
so
forth,
our
ordinary
rights
of
due
process
in
which
we
--
what
we
consider
to
be
hearing
of
this
type.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
one
was
a
former
registrar,
mr.
(inaudible),
who
would
had
service
term
and
was
--
and
resigned
and
retired
and
i'm
sure
his
--
although
i
don't
know
it,
i'm
sure
the
complaint
made
against
him
was
probably
in
his
capacity
as
a
registrar
prior
to
his
retirement
which
was
six
months
or
so
before
the
hearing.
the
others
were
private
individuals,
some
of
whom
had
challenged
voters
in
certain
parishes
of
the
state
which
were
approximately
200
or
more
miles
from
the
scene
of
the
investigation.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
no.
we
have
a
statute,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
which
provide
that
any
two
citizens
may
go
into
a
registrar's
office
that
is
who
--
are
residents
and
voters
of
the
parish
in
which
they
--
they
are
acting.
and
if
they
find
the
registration
of
any
person
or
persons
to
be
illegal,
not
in
accordance
with
law,
they
can
ensued
by
affidavit,
challenge
his
right
to
remain
on
the
roll.
and
then
the
law
provides
that
the
person
challenged
may
come
back
in
and
bring
with
him
three
registered
voters
from
the
same
parish
who
make
counter
affidavit
which
will
automatically
keep
him
on
the
roll.
then,
if
the
person's
challenging
wish
to
go
further,
they
go
to
court
because
that
sets
up
a
situation
of
someone
having
made
false
affidavits.
i'm
starting
to
mean
it
and
--
and
it
also
should
be
referred
to
the
district
attorney
or
other
proper
enforcement
officers
in
the
parish.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
no.
they
are
--
except
for
one,
who
was
a
former
registrar.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
yes.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
according
to
the
information
we
had,
yes.
that
they
had
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
the
record
does
not
show
that
because
all
we
have
is
statements
made
to
give
a
time
sequence
and
this
is
a
little
more
clearly.
what
happened
was
that
in
the
early
spring,
i
believe
in
march
of
1959,
colonel
rosenfeld,
the
chief
investigator
for
the
commission
came
to
louisiana
and
conducted
certain
investigations.
at
this
investigation,
the
attorney
general
gremillion
was
present,
i
was
present
and
two
of
the
registrars
involved
in
this
case
were
questioned.
we
also
had
conferences
open
between
counsels
at
the
time
and
colonel
rosenfeld
announced
and
appears
that
they
had
complaints.
he
listed
a
number
of
complaints
from
each
parish.
he
wanted
to
see
certain
records.
mr.
gremillion
advised
the
registrars
against,
showing
them
offhand.
but
at
my
request,
i
think
the
testimony
at
this
hearing
were
short.
we
agree
to
give
him
the
records
which
he
wanted
to
see
provided
he
would
show
us
the
complaints
or
let
us
see
or
agree
to
show
as
the
complaints
made
against
this
registrar.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i'll
say
--
i'll
say
this,
as
a
--
as
a
registered
voter
of
the
state,
any
registered
voter
of
the
state
has
the
right
to
go
and
see
the
record.
that's
--
they're
public
record
but
they
are
--
the
right
had
given
him
any
rights
to
vote
to
the
state.
as
a
register
voter
of
the
state,
i
would
agree
to
go
in
and
get
those
records
out
my
--
myself,
examine
and
let
him
examine
with
me
which
i
think
would
be
permissible
under
our
law.
he
himself
was
notified.
all
he
had
to
do
is
to
get
a
registered
voter
to
do
that
if
he
wanted
to
do
it.
he
was
also
notified
that
he
wanted
to
take
photographs
of
the
record.
all
he
had
to
do
is
get
25
registered
voters
to
sign
a
petition.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
it
depends
on
his
status.
of
course,
if
he
is
a
registered
voter
of
the
state
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
if
he
--
he's
a
nonresident
of
the
state
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
--
in
washington
parish,
that
situation
rose
and
he
was
--
they
were
permitted
to
see
it.
now,
i
dealt
with
somewhat
with
the
attorney
general
on
his
interpretation
of
the
law.
i
think
if
the
registrar
has
the
authority
to
show
him
if
--
if
the
registrar,
so
does
i,
they
don't
make
any
compulsion
on
the
registrar
afford
to
do
it.
i
recommended
to
our
registrar
that
the
--
our
record
is
perfectly
open.
we
had
no
objection
to
him
saying
to
keep
the
instances
that
our
sight
would
registrars
and
other
parishes,
registrars
whom
i
do
not
personally
represent.
but
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
say
this.
the
registrar
must
show
under
any
registered
voter
of
the
state.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
but
may
show
in
anyone
else
that
he
wishes
--
in
my
opinion
that
was
the
law.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
other
than
a
registered
voter
of
the
state.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
and
of
course,
there
is
so
many
of
those
that
no
real
problem.
i
mean,
if
anyone
who
wanting
to
see
a
record,
he
can
get
it
through
one
of
our
--
in
any
parish
of
the
state,
you
can
find
many
people
who
would
oppose
what
the
--
somebody's
registrars
are
accused
of
doing
here
so
that
they'd
be
anxious
to
--
to
go
in
and
show
the
fbi
the
record
if
they
want.
so
far
as
claiborne
parish
is
concern,
i
can't
speak
for
that.
i
represent
the
--
our
records
are
open.
anytime
you
want
to
come
in,
we
would
be
happy
to.
we
also
would
like
the
same
privilege
with
regard
to
accusations
made
against
us.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
we
have
around
5000.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
we
have
very
--
about
30
--
20
or
30
colored
votes
and
the
rest
are
--
are
white
and
the
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
population
is
around
20,000,
25,000
stiff
to
2%
colored
and
the
--
the
question
of
disparity
has
come
up
and
it's
--
of
course,
we
recognize
this
disparity.
i'll
say
this
had
been
more
white
people,
former
white
people
turn
down
for
registration
who
had
been
colored.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well,
the
25
do
not
have
to
be
from
the
parish.
but
the
--
as
far
as
our
records
are
concern,
it's
been
open.
we
haven't
tried
to
keep
anyone
out.
the
--
the
fbi
been
around
not
--
not
only
--
been
--
not
only
been
waiting
for
them
to
see
our
record
but
i
furnish
them
much
of
the
material
which
we
put
out
through
our
joint
legislative
committee.
i
mention
to
say
the
attorney
general
has
in
--
in
his
files,
most
of
our
publication
and
i
would
certain
like
the
court
to
see
those
because
instead
of
advocating
discrimination,
we
actually
advocate
the
opposite.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
52%
colored
and
48%
white
according
to
the
last
census.
it
changed
considerably
since
then
but
we
are
--
what
was
formerly
a
very
rural
area
now
going
almost
exclusively
to
trees.
planting
a
pine
tree
and
therefore,
we've
lost
a
great
many
of
our
colored
citizens.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
it's
in
extreme
northern
louisiana,
we
--
boarder
of
arkansas.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
what
is
that?
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
yes,
across
shreveport.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
we
lineup
to
the
arkansas
line
but
east
of
shreveport,
below
el
dorado,
if
you
are
familiar
where
--
that's
in
the
location
of
el
dorado.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
--
except
for
this
particular
litigation
which
we
are
now
concern.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
only
in
the
record.
it
was
urged
as
a
--
in
the
--
by
the
state
or
rather
by
the
registrars
that
they
were
being
required
to
do
something
illegal.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
no.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
don't
really
believe
there
is
ever
--
encounter
any
serious
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
that's
correct.
and
i
--
as
i
say,
i
--
i
disagree
with
him
after
the
--
the
interpretation
of
the
law.
i
think
that
he
is
doing
the
same
thing
in
that
case
that
we
are
here
accusing
the
commission
on
doing.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
not
--
i
do
not
believe
so,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
no.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
20,
i
believe,
something
i
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
there
were
approximately
10
or
--
well
one,
nine
or
none.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
and
so
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
oh,
yes.
they've
increased
under
this
program
because
--
in
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
a
system
of
registration
in
our
state
called
“permanent
registration”.
once
you
register,
you
never
have
to
reregister
in
--
in
many
parishes.
it's
optional
by
the
parish
and
we've
had
it
in
our
parish.
you
never
have
to
reregister
provided
you
vote
periodically
and
the
registration
in
our
parish
prior
to
the
institution
of
our
program
with
much
larger
than
it
is
now.
we
have
first
lost
population
and
secondly,
there
had
been
a
good
many
people
who
have
failed
to
exercise
their
rights,
who
have
been
unable
to
get
back
on
roll
when
they
attempted
to
try
and
register.
we
say
what
we
are
running
into
is
frankly
from
our
standpoint
of
the
program
that
we
have
--
is
our
position,
not
only
from
the
federal
government
but
from
the
local
authorities,
people
in
politics,
local,
who
want
to
have
a
full
registration
as
possible
without
regard
to
our
laws.
but
--
but
the
very
point
that
was
raised
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren
about
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
what
the
attorney
general
did
in
that
chase
is
--
is
this.
the
law
said
that
--
that
you
must
permit
anyone
who
is
a
registered
voter
to
see
these
records.
it
does
not
say
you
have
to
keep
anyone
else
from
saying.
that's
the
reason
why
i
say
the
registrar
has
the
discretion.
in
--
in
the
instant
case
--
but
this
--
what
the
civil
rights
act
did,
it
said
that
the
commission
had
to
observe
certain
rule.
it
didn't
say
they
couldn't
adopt
those
rules.
i
certainly
think
that
congress
intended
for
the
commission
to
adopt
supplementary
rules.
there
are
many
things
that
--
that
the
few
rules
that
they
had
in
the
act
did
not
cover.
anyone
who
has
conducted
investigations
or
legislative
otherwise
could
see
that.
i
think
it
was
--
that
--
if
we
consider
congressional
intent
in
particular,
that
intent
is
set
forth
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
the
--
and
i'm
not
advocating
that
we
apply
the
administrative
procedure
act
here
except
for
the
purpose
of
using
it
as
a
measure
of
what
the
congressional
intent
is.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
say
this.
it
depends
on
how
you
define
the
term
“adjudicatory”,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
if
you
use
the
term
“adjudicatory”
as
it's
used
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
then
it
does
have
adjudicatory
function.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well,
the
--
let
me
--
that
again
is
--
the
words
that
you
use
are
somewhat
difficult
for
me
to
put
my
finger
on.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
may
i
read
you
the
definition
from
the
administrative
procedure
act?
i
think
it's
important
because
the
administrative
procedure
act
uses
the
term
“adjudicatory”
as
being
the
measure
of
when
this
ordinary
function
of
due
process
or
to
be
accorded
when
they
are
not
and
what
the
commission
in
effect
has
done
in
this
case
is
say
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
not
applicable.
yet,
they
have
adopted
the
very
test
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
gives,
but
they
have
used
a
different
definition
for
the
word
“adjudicate”.
and
the
word
“adjudicate”
as
defined
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
can
be
found
on
page
4
of
my
brief,
in
section
2
of
the
act
5
u.s.c.
1001,
(d)
--
section
(d)
order
and
adjudication.
order
means
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
final
disposition
whether
affirmative,
negative,
injunctive
or
declaratory
in
form
of
any
agency,
in
any
matter
other
than
rule
making
but
including
licensing.
adjudication
means
the
agency
process
for
the
formulation
of
an
order.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
in
the
sense
that
--
that
a
declaration
as
an
order,
yes.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
yes.
you
see,
this
act
in
defining
order
says
order
means
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
final
disposition
whether
affirmative,
negative,
injunctive
or
declaratory.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
no.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
yes.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
by
way
of
a
report.
matter
of
fact,
this
commission
is
required
to
make
reports
not
only
to
congress,
but
to
the
president.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
if
they
make
a
report
which
is
declaratory
in
form
saying
that
john
jones
had
discriminated
in
--
in
claiborne
parish
against
a
certain
registrant,
in
--
in
recommending
to
the
president
that
he
uses
executive
powers
to
bring
about
the
prosecution
of
that
part,
then
i
say
that
that
is
an
order
within
the
meaning
of
administrative
procedure
act.
let
me
go
further,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
test
of
due
process,
as
i
see
it,
is
not
to
be
bound
down
by
this
test
of
adjudication.
i
think
due
process
is
a
--
is
a
term
that
has
been
defined
--
explained
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
joint
anti-fascist
committee
cases.
it
is
a
living
principle.
it's
something
that
cannot
be
bound
down
by
any
particular
formula.
it's
something
we
have
to
examine
each
particular
case
and
see
whether
or
not
it
fits
due
process.
if
you
will
recall
in
the
joint
anti-fascist
case,
there
was
no
sanction
applied.
the
attorney
general
could
not
apply
any
sanctions.
all
he
did
was
make
a
declaration
that
certain
organizations,
communist
fronts
or
something
of
that
type.
in
the
court
itself,
this
court
pointed
out,
that
there
was
--
was
no
sanction
involved
in
the
matter
except
there
was
a
matter
of
declaring
indirectly,
indirectly
the
effect
of
making
that
declaration
would
hurt
this
particular
organization
just
as
indirectly,
the
effect
of
a
declaration
by
this
commission
would
hurt
these
people
who
were
called
before
it.
as
i
read
the
cases
of
this
court,
the
joint
anti-fascist
case,
peters
versus
hobby,
in
greene
versus
mcelroy
or
a
series
of
cases
which
set
forth
due
process,
as
i
understand
it,
which
must
be
accorded
in
administrative
hearing
and
administrative
proceedings
where
agencies
of
the
federal
government
are
concern.
and
that
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
the
only
question
involved
was
whether
or
not
congress
or
the
president
or
the
particular
creating
agency
explicitly
--
gave
the
explicit
authority
to
adopt
these
rules.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
--
to
this
court
that
in
the
case
of
groban
and
in
the
case
of
anonymous,
that
question
was
not
even
involve.
in
case
of
groban,
we
have
1900
statute
of
ohio
which
had
been
in
effect
for
many
years
and
recognized
explicitly
giving
the
authority
to
do
this
to
the
fire
marshal.
that
was
not
questioned.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
think
we
have.
in
the
case
of
anonymous,
although
the
statute
was
not
particularly
clear
on
me,
there
had
been
many
judicial
decisions.
and
of
course,
the
state
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
law
is
binding
on
the
federal
court.
so
the
state
courts
had
already
found
out
that
this
authority
was
granted
to
the
question
of
explicit
authorization
didn't
arise,
neither
one
of
those
cases
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
--
to
indicate
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
but
in
the
case
of
the
joint
anti-fascist
committee,
the
case
of
peters
versus
hobby,
the
case
of
greene
versus
mcelroy,
that
was
the
only
question
and
that
is
the
only
question
in
which
the
lower
court
decided
this
case.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
we
did
that
in
the
case
of
--
in
clinton
case
which
came
to
this
court.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
we
would
have
--
right.
but
i
might
say
this
that
the
grand
jury
proceedings
are
constitutionally
based,
grand
jury
proceedings
were
recognized
as
the
essential
function
of
anglo-saxon
jurisprudence
(inaudible)
was
created.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well,
even
that
is
a
--
a
long
established
and
well-recognized.
the
question
of
explicit
authority
doesn't
arise
in
those
cases,
the
--
because
that
has
already
been
settled
by
innumerable
explicit
laws
in
--
in
cases
in
the
past.
and
it's
historically
based
--
based
in
our
constitution
as
well
as
in
our
whole
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
right.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
they
certainly
do.
but
i
say
this
it
had
--
this
commission
had
been
set
up
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
had
it
been
imported
as
a
legal
device
from
england
at
the
time
of
the
formation
of
our
country.
it
would
enjoy
a
different
status
from
an
administrative
tribunal
created
by
congress
in
recent
years.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
not
to
my
knowledge
and
i
don't
know
any
particular.
they've
been
doing
it
at
congressional
committees
but
not
as
executive
agencies
and
in
this
case,
they
set
up
an
executive
agency
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
this
from
many
of
the
other
cases.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
feel
that
insofar
as
the
question
of
explicit
authority
is
concern,
if
this
were
a
congressional
committee
that
would
be
eliminated.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
constitutional
rights
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
burton,
if
we
remove
the
question
of
authorization
in
this
case
will
fairly
bristle
the
constitutional
question
as
i
see
it.
the
lower
court
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
go
into
that
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
--
but
in
my
opinion
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
the
constitutional
principle
of
that
--
of
due
process
could
arise
in
any
case.
but
as
i
say,
due
process
is
something
that
you
can't
say,
“here
it
is
and
it
goes
this
far
and
no
further.”
and
you
--
you
have
to
consider
a
congressional
committee's
investigation
in
context
with
everything
is
going
before
and
--
and
everything
has
not
going
before
the
same
for
administrative
tribunal.
and
i
say
that
the
administrative
tribunals
--
we've
had
substantially
the
same
question
so
for
as
i
can
see
indistinguishably.
the
same
questions
arise
many
times,
in
the
cases
that
i've
cited
in
peters
and
greene
and
the
other
cases
that
had
been
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
exactly.
the
complaints,
as
i
see
it,
can't
be
treated
in
the
other
way
because
they
do
charge
crime.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well,
again,
if
--
when
we
speak
of
order,
you're
speaking
of
a
--
some
kind
of
sanction,
i
believe
that
that's
right,
some
--
some
--
either
an
indictment
or
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
what
is
that?
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
or
declaration.
i
don't
know
of
any
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well,
i'm
--
i'm
speaking
of
declaration
not
in
the
--
that
sense.
i'm
speaking
of
merely
a
statement
saying
that
so
and
so
it
done
so
and
so.
but
if
you
want
to
use
any
words
of
justice,
well,
so
long
as
we
have
the
same
meaning
in
that,
i
say
this,
insofar
as
criminal
proceedings
are
concern,
i
do
not
know
of
any
preliminary
criminal
proceeding
which
if
some
basis
is
found
for
the
action,
does
not
result
in
some
such
order
as
you
are
speaking
of.
on
the
other
hand,
you've
got
the
case
of
the
joint
anti-fascist
committee
which
was
an
administrative
proceeding
which
resulted
in
nothing
more
that
state
address
--
describing
the
organizations
involved.
and
that's
exactly
what
i
see
would
result
in
this
case,
a
statement
describing
these
individuals
and
their
conduct.
and
i
think
it
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
in
--
practically,
every
case
that
i
know
of
in
our
legislature,
we
do
not
grant
the
right
to
--
of
subpoena
to
our
--
our
committees
and
they
do
not
follow
these
particular
rights
now.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
do
not
recall
any
case.i
don't
say
it
have
not
been
in
them,
imagine
they
have
been
but
in
all
the
instances
now
had
been
involved,
there
are
number
of
hearing,
we've
never
had
the
right
of
subpoena.
i
think
that
is
a
key
factor
in
this
whole
matter.
that
if
there
were
no
subpoena
powers
involved
in
the
question
of
due
process,
would
take
much
a
different
aspect
in
the
case.
the
--
that
is
the
key
to
distinguishing
the
norwegian
nitrogen
case
from
which
the
government
relies
from
it.
norwegian
nitrogen
case
which
they
say
is
very
similar
was
to
me
almost
completely
dissembled.
first
place,
if
your
honors
will
recall
in
that
case,
what
was
involved
was
a
--
a
hearing
of
the
tariff
commission.
a
public
hearing
called
by
the
tariff
commission
in
--
to
receive
evidence
voluntarily
not
on
the
subpoena
from
anyone
that
i
could
find
in
which
--
on
which
they
would
base
tariff
rates
on
nitrate
of
soda.
now,
the
norwegian
nitrogen
people
who
would
be
affected
by
it,
appeared
in
our
position
to
the
american
nitrogen
people.
and
they
were
given
the
right
of
cross-examination
and
so
forth
and
--
and
the
only
thing
that
were
restricted
was
certain
information
bearing
upon
manufacturing
processes
of
the
american
nitrogen
people.
and
i
think
if
the
court
will
read
that
case,
you
will
see
the
question
of
subpoena
was
not
involved,
the
--
really
the
question
of
due
process
is
entirely
different.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
mcgrain
versus
daugherty
which
they
have
used
in
that
case,
the
--
the
person
subpoenaed
was
a
nephew
of
the
attorney
general
not
the
attorney
general
himself.
the
attorney
general
was
a
person
in
--
accused.
here,
they
are
subpoenaing
the
accused
which
have
been
pushed
in
an
entirely
different
aspect
on
the
case.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
as
i
read
it,
they
are
unlimited
in
their
scope
on
this
matter.
they
are
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i'm
using
the
word
finding
in
its
ordinary
sense.
finding
what
i
would
--
it
would
be
a
conclusion
of
some
kind,
if
that
was
reached.
read
this
section
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
that
is
correct.
shall
submit
interim
report
at
such
time
as
a
--
to
the
congress
and
to
the
president
of
that
--
of
that
--
activities,
findings
and
recommendations.
as
i
say
those
activities'
finding
a
recommendation
can
cover
practically
anything.
my
time
is
limited
and
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
certainly
think
it
would.
i
think
it
would.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
the
preceding
section
requires
them
to
almost
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
well,
i
think
it
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i'm
--
i'm
arguing
that
--
was
--
what
would
be
the
effect
of
it.
it
can
be
a
--
injury
by
the
--
the
order
that
would
result
of
him
being
accused
of
violating
the
laws
and
so
forth.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
exactly.
that's
all
it
was.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
would
like
to
say
one
or
two
things
before
i
sit
down.
first
is
this
that
if
congress
intended,
specifically
intended
to
give
the
commission
this
authority,
we've
had
an
entirely
different
case.
this
exact
bill
is
the
same
bill
is
up
for
congress
at
this
time,
right
now.
if
they
wish
to
give
them
this
authority
explicitly,
they
can
do
it
in
as
--
almost
as
sooner
the
time
this
court
could
do
it
by
judgment.
that
authority
resides
in
congress
and
they
are
sitting
over
there
now
considering
this
bill.
if
the
--
if
the
court
holds
the
commission
to
the
ruling
in
greene
and
these
other
cases,
congress
will
be
able
to
--
if
they
wish
to
clarify
and
give
them
this
explicit
authority,
they
will
be
able
to
do
so.
i
think
that
that
is
a
--
a
matter
that
should
be
weighed
very,
very
carefully
in
connection
with
what
we
are
--
are
here
discussing.
another
thing
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
what
--
what
i'm
saying
that
--
that
would
remove
the
principal
question
involved
here
in
this
case
which
is
one
of
explicit
authority.
the
--
the
constitutional
basis
would
also
--
but
what
i
believe,
i
sincerely
believe
that
if
this
question
is
presented
directly
to
congress,
congress
will
going
to
make
them
yield
the
right
of
cross-examination
and
the
right
of
confrontation
in
--
in
notice,
make
them
give
it
to
people
that
are
accused
of
crimes
that
are
brought
before
them
for
an
investigation.
now,
i
don't
think
congress
are
going
give
them
that.
but
--
but
i
say
that
the
opportunities
there,
if
congress
wishes
to
do
it,
they
can
remove
that
principle
question
by
an
act
at
this
particular
time.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
but
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
i
would
have
to
demur
for
this
reason,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
--
the
court
below
decided
the
act
itself
was
constitutional.
they
--
they
specifically
refused
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
rules,
if
not
ultra
vires,
were
unconstitutional.
but
i
think
it
--
in
all
--
according
to
procedure
it
should
go
back
to
them
to
decide
whether
or
not
assuming
that
the
rules
not
ultra
vires,
the
rules
themselves
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
they
decided
that
the
statute
insofar
that
--
might
be
considered
an
improper
delegation
of
--
of
a
legislative
authority
to
be
exactly
what's
constitutional.
they
--
they
specifically
reserved
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
yes.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
if
it
please
the
court,
i
feel
this
commission
is
sort
of
like
a
cat.
it
has
--
has
at
least
nine
lives
if
--
if
not
more.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
the
--
the
--
that
was
the
same
argument
that
was
used
in
the
court
below
and
it
was
confidently
predicted
at
that
time
that
the
commission's
life
will
be
renewed
and
it
was,
and
it's
much
easier
to
create
an
agency
in
my
experience
and
is
to
kill
one
and
i
feel
like
from
observation
of
this
commission
go
north
quite
a
while.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
only
insofar
as
the
sixth
amendment
is
incorporated
generally
in
the
term
due
process
and
that
should
have
to
--
to
apply
to
a
particular
case.
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
oh,
no.
not
--
mr.
w.
m.
shaw
we
recognize
this
is
not
a
criminal
prosecution
but
as
i
understand
due
process
or
--
or
the
--
it's
--
it's
something
that
includes
ordinary
rights
or
they're
generally
considered
heritage
from
the
anglo-saxon
jurisprudence.
thank
you
very
much.
