justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
judge
(inaudible)
in
that
--
their
power
to
review,
there
has
been
--
used
the
phrase,
“statute
deprived
them
of
their
right
to
confrontation
and
cross-examination,”
i
think
you
answered,
yes.
now,
do
you
really
mean
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
deprive
them
of
a
right
to
confrontation
and
cross-examination?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
mean
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that's
the
issue
we
have,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what's
the
difference,
if
i
may
ask,
the
greene
(inaudible)
and
the
groban
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
you
were
told
in
groban,
but
the
fire
marshal
might
constitute
to
interrogate
this
man
even
though
he
was
a
suspect
and
we
have
no
conflict.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
the
distinction
and
there
are
existence
you
say,
but
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what's
the
basis
(inaudible)
and
we
might
have
those
at
some
(inaudible)
this
and
that
indictment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
supposing
you
could
see
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
this
judge
at
least
(voice

--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
one
which
as
to
550.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
you
say
that
there
were
three
under
these
rules.
no
benefit
from
the
allowance
of
counsel
to
the
witness,
would
he
not
be
able
to
advise
him
(inaudible)
obtain
the
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
a
valuable
of
the
lawyer
under
certain
rules,
the
advisement
of
his
constitutional
rights
in
the
part
of
judge,
you
say?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
suppose
that
every
person
who
gain
the
trust
needed
by
a
grand
jury
and
expect
to
be
indicted
with
the
right
to
go
in
there
with
his
lawyer
and
cross
examine
the
witnesses,
too?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
suppose
that
if
it's
true
in
the
some
cases,
the
line
between
whether
the
constitution
maybe
or
may
not
be
defamatory,
could
get
to
define.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
it
does
not
--
the
subdivision
(e)
of
section
102
expressly
does
the
commission
with
a
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not,
in
their
view,
it
will
--
the
testimony
prove
to
be
defamatory?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
leave
and
exceed
there,
mr.
gremillion,
just
following
you
up
to
that
point,
what
--
if
that's
true,

apply
to
a
congressional
committee?

there's

the
court
has
never
agreed
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
made
all
of
the
bill
of
rights
applicable
to
the
states.
but
here,
we
have
to
consider
this
on
the
basis
of
the
whole
bill
of
rights,
and
that
was
not
true
in
groban.
