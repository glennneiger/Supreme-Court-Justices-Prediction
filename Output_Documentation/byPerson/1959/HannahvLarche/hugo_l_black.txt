justice

is
that
the
only
question
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
pointing
out
in
record,
the
precise
ruling
that
you
consider
to
be
before
us?
justice

besides
the
point
which
we
have
to
decide.
justice

at
the
end
of
the

the
printed
record?
justice

but
that
first
is
what
you
consider
to
be
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
we
are
to
consider
that
the
rules
that
have
been
adopted
do
deprive
persons
investigated,
i
won't
say
their
rights.
and
do
deprive
them
of
any
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross-examine
witnesses
brought
before
the
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
--
but
the
--
the
rule
does
provide
that
they
shall
not
be
confronted,
or
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does
deprive
them
of
their
right
of
cross-examination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
we
have
the
question
before
us,
as
to
whether
they
can
examine
them
in

session
entirely,
is
that
here?
justice

i
think
i
said,
opportunity.
i
intended
to
change
it
if
i
could
and
was
a
mistake.
i
(inaudible)
right
was
used
here,
but
i
thought
i
changed
this
opportunity.
justice

but
they
--
they
argue
seemingly
i
have
read
the
whole
of
the
brief
--
justice
hugo

--
but
they
argue
a
lot
about
being
made
to
incriminate
themselves

defaming
themselves.
is
there
anything

does
that
have
to
be
decided
here?
justice

black
(voice

--
justice
hugo

black
well,
that
wouldn't
excuse
them
from
coming
as
witnesses,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
objection
aimed
at
the
commission's
right
to
investigate
or
the
commission's
right
to
call
them
in
as
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.

is
there
any
federal
statute
which
would
make
it
a
criminal
offense?
justice
hugo

to
deprive
people
of
their
vote
on
account
of
race?
justice

i
suppose
that
you
said
though
and
i
take
that
some
difference
in
attacks
made
by

any
witnesses

attacks
made
by
people
who
might
be
subjected

criminal
prosecution
right
now.
i'm
not
saying
to
what
extent,
but
there
might
--
justice

--
be
different
problems
involved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
that
decisive?
justice
hugo

would
mean
a
difference
here
in
your
judgment
if
this
--
instead
of
saying
what
it
does
that
it
investigate
allegations
in
writing
under
oath?
certain
citizens
have
violated
the
criminal
statutes
by
depriving
people
their
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color.
this
commission
isn't
authorized
to
investigate
it
and
make
a
report
to
the
president
or
the
attorney
general
within
60
days?
justice
hugo

it's
not
called
a
crime,
but
it
would
be
rather
difficult
to
get
up
actions
of
that
kind,
it
wouldn't
violate
the

wouldn't
it?
justice

do
you
think
that
settles
all
our
problems?
justice

(voice

on

that
this

investigation

justice

are
you
sure
this
can
be
analogized
to
be
the
exquisites
of
indictment

living

the

justice

well,
the
grand

of
a
historical
agency
that
certain

is
based
on
the
ground
that
--
and
they're
once
friends

neighbors
sit

they
investigate
the
situation
in
that
community
and
they
let
them
sit
out
the
charges
that
will
be
proffered.
justice
hugo

and
i
--
i
suppose,
you
could
hardly
claim
all
the
privileges
that
a

have
for
investigating
committee
of
any
kind,
couldn't
you?
justice

well,
that
might
follow,
that
might
follow.
justice

black
i
don't
say
it
wouldn't
now,
i'm
just
asking
you
how
you
could
put
them
on
the
same
thing
--
justice
hugo

black
--
constitutionally
speaking
and
historically
speaking.
justice
hugo

black
well,
that

wouldn't
have
much
to
do
then?

at

justice

--
justice

black
where
is
the
provision
for
(voice

--
justice

--
for
contempt.
you
said
he
could
be
punished
for
contempt?
where
is
that
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
do
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
punishment
fixed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
--
what
is
that?
what
--
within
what
limits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
not
any
fixed
in
this
answer
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he's
going
to
get
it
on
the
basis
of
value
to
be
more
valuable
if
his
attorney
could
cross-examine
the
witnesses
then,
would
it
not?
as
far
as
value
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

that
might
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
--
the
question
i
asked
you
was
you
testified
that
the
derived
value
after
all
you
--
have
said
it
to
your
ear
and
whisper
to
you
--
you're
--
about
your
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
more
valuable,
of
course,
wouldn't
it
if
he
had
a
lawyer
there
to
represent
him,
cross
examine
the
witness,
what
is
right
or
wrong.
i
don't
suppose
you
deny
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
the
registrar
thought
he
needed
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
he
had
--
would
have
a
different
view.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
--
all
--
all
i
was
asking
was,
assuming
that
whether
it
--
whether
he's
got
a
right
to
one
or
not,
can
you
deny
that
ordinary
human
being
in
this
country
would
think
he's
better,
if
he
had
a
lawyer
to
sit
there
and
cross
examine
the
witnesses
sets
up
and
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
again
--
again
i
suggest
that
there's
quite
a
difference,
whatever
one
may
decide
about
this
case
in
a
grand
jury
investigation
conducted
as
his
--
his
character
has
been
and
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
created,
an
investigation
by
a
committee
from
somewhere
or
a
commission.
justice

do
we

justice

may
i
ask
you
if
your
contention
boils
down
to
this?
i'm
not
quite
sure
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i'm
not
quite
sure,
i
understand
that
the
scope
of
your
contention
is
it
substantially
this
that
it
all
provides
for
accusations
be
made
by
affidavits
against
registrars.
accusations
were

as

justice

the

the

it
does

by

it
does
authorize
a
report

the
charges
at
the
hearing
of
its
--
justice
hugo

black
and
so,
as
your
contention
--
it
is
your
contention,
as
i
understand,
that
under
such
circumstances
of
an
accusation
of
that
kind,
whether
it'd
be
in
the
nature
of
the
preliminary
charge
or
anything
else,
your
people
are
entitled
to
be
represented
to
that
counsel
or
cross-examine
the
witness
to
be
confronted
with
the
witness
as
against
him.
justice
hugo

is
that
--
justice
hugo

black
you're
basing
it
on
the
constitutional
provision
to
authorize
that
calls
for
a
testimony,
the
right
to
cross-examine,
the
right
to
counsel.
justice

well,
i
--
i
don't
suppose
you
had
to
say,
it
was
denied
that
congress
is
without
power
to
violate
the
constitution.
their
claim
is
it
does
not
violate
those
provisions
of
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.

the
groban
case
was
decided
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
rules
are
not
considered
the

justice
hugo

you're
relying
on
the
provision
of
the
constitution
as
required
by
the
federal
government
in
its
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
quite
understood
yet
why
you
say
congress
did
not
authorize
that
to
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
now,
i
understand
you're
constitutional
point.

why
do
you

congress
did
not

one?
justice

which
rule

which
particular

do
you
say
it
goes
beyond
an
action
of
the

with
reference
to
the

--
justice

goes
beyond
the

congress
granted.

(c),
you
say
that's
not
sufficient,

why
do
you
say
that
goes
beyond
the

that
congress
gave
the
commission?
justice

i
--
i
understand
those
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
want
to
get
in,
and
if
i
can,
is
why
you
say
that
the
committee
went
beyond
its
power
in
taking
--
enacting
that
rule
even
though
it
does
deny
cross-examine.
why
do
you
say
congress
didn't
authorize
it?
what
was
there
in
the
act
passed
by
congress
that
leads
you
to
say,
this
is
