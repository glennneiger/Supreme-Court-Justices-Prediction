chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
the
commission
determined
that
it
would
defame,
degrade
or
incriminate
a
person
that
it
should
have
the
right
itself
to
--
to
say
the
testimony
should
be
given
in
the
executive
session
without
regard
to
the
wish
of
the
witness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
suppose
he
didn't
want
to
--
suppose
he
didn't
want
to
testify
in
the
executive
sessions,
suppose
he
said
now,
“i'm
going
to
testify
--
i
want
to
testify
before
the
world
in
--“
and
what
--
what
effect
would
you
give
to
this
section?
chief
justice
earl

that's
the
one
i'm
thinking
--
chief

--
not
the
other
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl

i
see.
chief
justice
earl

that's
required?
chief

yes.
chief

well,
go
ahead.
finish
your

chief

judge
walsh,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
that's
the
maximum
where
he's
tried
by
a
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
--
if
tried
by
a
court,
the
maximum
is
$300
fine
or
imprisonment,
less
than
or
not
to
exceed
45
days.
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
walsh,
may
i
--
may
i
try
to
clear
my
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mind
to
little
on
this
--
on
this
procedure
at
these
hearings.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
a
number
of
complainants
that
form
the
basis
for
this
proposed
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
those
were
persons
who
claimed
that
they
had
been
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
vote
although
they
had
the
qualifications.
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
what
investigations
you
outlined
to
us,
there
was
an
affidavit
filed,
is
that
correct?
filed
by
these
people,
setting
forth
the
--
the
elements
of
the
complaint
they
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
then
--
then
the
investigation
follows?
now,
in
addition
to
that,
each
of
these
complainants
is
called
before
the
commission
to
testify.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
yes,
if
there
is
any
--
if
there
is
to
be
any
hearing
at
all,
those
people
who
made
those
affidavits
are
all
called
to
testify.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
that's
a
result
of
your
investigation
and
as
the
result
of
the
affidavit,
it
appears
to
the
committee
that
the
charge
defames
anyone.
the
hearing
is
in
executive
session?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
if
in
the
judgment
of
the
commission,
it
does
not
defame
any
individual,
then
he
appears
in
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
in
the
event
he
appears
in
executive
session.
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
the
commission
furnishes
the
person
who
is
supposedly
defamed
with
a
copy,
not
of
the
affidavit,
but
a
copy
of
the
testimony
the
man
gives
before
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
the
--
the
person
defamed
or
alleges
to
defamed,
is
invited
to
appear
as
a
voluntary
witness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
file
statements,
yes.
if
he
wishes
to
--
to
do
neither,
then
the
commission
exercised
its
own
discretion
as
to
whether
it
will
issue
a
subpoena
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
at
the
time
they
appear
before
the
commission
for
hearing,
they
have
a
copy
of
the
testimony
that
the
so-called
complainant
gave
before
the
commission
in
executive
session?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
they
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
listen
to
it
in
executive
session.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
rule
--
is
that
in
the
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
if
may
carry
this
is
one
or
two
steps
farther,
if
the
--
witness
--
and
subpoenaed,
declines
to
testify
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
the
matter
is
certified
--
the
attorney
general
may
certify
the
matter
to
the
district
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
district
court
may
hold
a
hearing
and
determine
whether
or
not,
he
should
testify?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
directs
him
to
testify,
he
is
again
called
at
the
hearing
and
if
he
refuses
to
testify,
then
the
manner
goes
to
the
district
court
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
if
convicted,
if
tried
by
a
jury,
the
maximum
is
$500
or
$1000
or
six
months
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he's
tried
by
the
court,
the
maximum
is
45
days
in
jail
or
$300?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
apologize
for
taking
so
much
for
your
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
i
--
i
did
want
to
get
those
steps
clear
in
my
mind
and
they
weren't
quite
clear.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
gremillion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general,
putting
this
side
for
a
moment,
the
testimony
of
the
--
of
the
registrars,
could
they
--
could
they
have
had
the
records
--
the
public
records
of
the
registrar's
office.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that
controversy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
was
that
act
passed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
interrogatory
by
whom
mr.
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general,
you
--
i'm
concerned
about
these
rights.
you
say
your
clients
were
deprived
of.
now,
if
they
were
constitutional
rights,
would
congress
have
anymore
right
to
violate
them
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
than
a
--
than
a
creature
of
--
was
it
congress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
--
i
--
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
before
--
before
you
got
--
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
any
questions,
as
i
understood
you
to
say,
that
the
--
the
constitutional
rights
of
your
clients
have
been
violated.
and
on
the
other
hand,
you
said
that
--
that
--
well
--
that
to
be
violated.
on
the
other
hand,
you
said
that
if
congress
had
done
precisely
the
same
thing
that
you
would
not
be
here.
that
it
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
didn't
mean
that,
your
honor.
i
--
i
didn't
mean
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
oh,
what
did
you
say
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
if
--
if
this
had
been
a
congressional
committee,
down
in
your
--
your
state,
operating
as
this
commission
did,
it
would
be
your
position
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
it
violated
your
rights
as
much
as
this
commission
has?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
well,
i
totally
misunderstood
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
a
little
--
a
little
while
ago.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
your
knowledge,
general,
has
any
--
any
congressional
committee
ever
functioned
as
you
proposed
that
they
must
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
say
then
that
all
of
these
investigatory
procedures
of
--
of
the
congress
throughout
--
throughout
the
years,
whereas
dispiriting
out
wrongdoing
of
one
kind
for
another,
have
violated
the
--
the
constitutional
rights
of
those
who
--
it
is
investigating.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
didn't
--
didn't
all
three
of
the
judges
below
hold
that
this
administrative
procedure
act
was
inapplicable
to
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
16.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
is
the
point
of
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general,
didn't
the
--
didn't
the
congress
indicate
the
extent
to
which
counsel
should
participate
in
these
proceedings
in
--
in
(c)
of
102,
when
it
says
witnesses
at
the
hearings
maybe
accompanied
by
their
own
counsel
for
the
purpose
of
advising
them
concerning
their
constitutional
rights.
wasn't
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
isn't
that
--
doesn't
that
indicate
to
the
commission
the
--
the
extent
to
which
it
didn't
expected
counsel
to
participate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general,
as
i
understood
--
as
i
understood
judge
walsh,
before
your
witnesses
took
the
stand,
they
were
entitled
to
--
to
read
or
have
a
copy
of
the
testimony
that
was
taken
against
them.
anything
that
is
derogatory
of
them,
they
were
entitled
to
(c).
now,
if
that
is
true,
how
can
it
be
said
that
when
they
take
the
stand,
they
have
no
idea
of
what
has
been
said
against
them
or
what
they're
going
to
have
to
protect
themselves.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general,
do
you
--
do
you
challenge
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
that
the
testimony
of
witnesses
against
your
clients
though
it
was
available
to
them,
before
they
took
the
stand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
this
hearing
to
be
held?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
in
the
record
here
a
letter
dated
--
washington
d.c.,
june
11th,
1959,
the
honorable
jack
p.f.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
gremillion.
dear
general
--
dear
general
gremillion,
this
one
advised
you
that
the
commission
and
its
official
meeting
held
here
yesterday,
june
10,
1959,
authorized
a
hearing
on
louisiana
voting
complaints
pursuant
to
section
105
(f)
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957,

the

is
scheduled
to
be
held
on

in

sincerely
yours,

chief
justice

warren
well,
i
understand
your
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general,
i
understand
from
the
record
that
when
--
when
fbi
agents
went
to
the
registrars
to
see
the
official
and
public
records
of
--
of
the
voting
that
they
were
refused
the
right
to
see
them
on
the
grounds
that
they
did
not
come
within
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
section
of
being
a
citizen
of
--
of
the
parish
and
that
they
did
not
have
25
other
citizens
vouch
for
them
in
--
in
--
so
they
could
have
an
opportunity
to
see
the
records
--1
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed,
mr.
lassiter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
mr.
shaw.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
reason
why
those
registrars
should
--
should
not
have
told
the
commission
exactly
what
you
have
told
us
here
today?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know?
they
haven't
--
they
haven't
asked
anything
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
wouldn't
that
have
counteracted
the
--
the
affidavits
or
whatever
test
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
--
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
they
--
why
would
they
want
to
testify
this
such
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
bring
them
to
justice
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
the
language
that
says
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
this
commission
here,
this
commission
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
mean
that
if
they
didn't
--
if
the
commission
knew
of
these
things
and
didn't
do
anything
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
--
the
commission
would
be
liable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
the
members
of
the
commission
would
be
liable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
challenge
the
word
“right”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
qualifies,
doesn't
he
have
a
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
that
they
were?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
right
did
you
have
if
the
law
prevents
it
to
say
the
--
that
the
commission
could
or
could
not
under
certain
circumstances
see
the
records
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you're
--
if
you're
representing
private
individuals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
would
not
permit
an
fbi
agent
of
the
united
states
government
in
investigating
matters
of
this
kind
to
see
the
records.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no
he
goes
just
as
a
--
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
going
to
say,
your
--
your
understanding
of
the
law
is
then
that
the
registrar
has
the
discretion
to
show
the
records
to
whom
he
wants.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
may
show
in
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
may
withhold
them
from
anyone
--
anyone
that
he
desires
to
hold
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
are
20
--
20
negroes
registered
and
the
law
requires
him
to
have
25
to
be
able
to
let
someone
make
a
copy
of
the
record,
where
do
you
suppose
he
get
the
25?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
do
you
say
the
percentage
of
whites
and
negroes
were?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
attorney
general
who
advised
all
of
the
registrars,
did
he
not,
not
to
permit
the
fbi
to
--
to
c
&
e.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
hasn't
the
--
hasn't
congress
been
doing
this
since
1890
something?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
feel
then
that
congress
could
do
this
but
this
commission
cannot?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
constitutional
rights
you're
taking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
i
was
getting
at
mr.
shaw
is
would
the
same
constitutional
principle
be
involved
if
--
if
it
was
a
congressional
investigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shaw,
does
your
--
when
your
legislative
--
legislature
conducts
investigations
as
to
illegalities,
alleged
illegalities
and
irregularities,
does
it
accord
to
all
witnesses
the
right
you
--
you
claim
for
these
people
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
never
--
do
you
never
have
the
power
of
subpoena?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
