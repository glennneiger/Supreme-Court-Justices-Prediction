this

was

was

because
of
the
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
of
what
kind
of
a
hearing
is
it
going
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
those
people
who
had
filed
written
statements
to
which
they've
--
they're
under
oath.
justice

stewart
now,
at
the
--
both
the
opening
hearing
in
the
morning
and
in
--
in
the
executive
session
in
the
afternoon,
are
the
--
are
these
--
are
these
registrars
and
other
people
free
to
be
present
with
their
counsel?
justice

the
issue
in
which
(voice

--

excuse,
mr.
attorney
general.
justice

(voice

understanding.
the
issue
to
which
you've
been
addressing
yourself,
the
last
few
minutes,
groban
and
anonymous
is
the
constitutional
issue,
is
that
right
justice
potter
stewart
those
cases
--
those
two
cases
arose
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
arises
in
your
view
under
what,
the
due
process
clause
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
does
it
arise
under
the
specific
guarantees
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
why
the
fourteenth?
what
state
action
is
involved?
justice
potter
stewart
why
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
action,
is
it
not
by
the
federal
government
only?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i'm
simply
asking
that
you
get
this
argument
straightened
out.
it
seems
to
me,
there
are
good
many
or
at
least
there
are
two
basic
issues
here
and
i
am
having
a
little
trouble
getting
in
disentangled
from
my
own
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
court
below,
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
question,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
they
relied
that
substantially
on
greene
against
mcelroy.
justice
potter
stewart
lack
of
authority.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
this
commission
had
not
been
given
authority
by
congress
to
--
to
adopt
the
rules
and
the
procedures
which
it
had
adopted.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
was
the
basis
of
their
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
--
and
tell
me
if
i'm
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i'm
trying
to
ask
for
information.
now
then,
you,
of
course,
are
--
are
asserting
that
here.
and
that's
quite
a
distinct
and
a
separate
issue
from
the
issue
that
we
would
reach,
if
we
concluded
that
the
court
below
is
a
mistaken
and
that
these
procedures
have
been
authorized
by
congress,
isn't
that
correct?
then
we
would
reach
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i
broke
into
your
eloquence
and
i
--
if
we
reach
that
issue
then,
is
it
your
contention
that
the
constitutional
rights
that
you
be
--
assert
on
behalf
of
the
registrars
and
the
private
citizens
respectively,
are
rights
which
arise
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
on
the
one
hand
or
are
they
rights
which
are
specifically
guaranteed
by
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
such
as
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
which
--
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
page
60
of
the
record,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
what
--
what
is
the
significance
in
subsection
(b)
of
this
act?
justice
potter
stewart
page
(inaudible)
102
subsection
(b).
justice
potter
stewart
those
facts
or
does
it
not,
guess
the
power
in
the
commission
will
adopt
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
did
you
read,
mr.
attorney
general
--
how
do
you
read
subsection
(j)
on
page
58?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
subsection
(j)
on
page
58,
if
the
commission
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
one
of
the
rules
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
never
was
a
hearing,
was
there?
