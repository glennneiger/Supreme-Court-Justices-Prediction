justice
john
m.
harlan
how
does
the
question
arise?
these
people,
did
they
actually
get
before
the
commission,
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
allegations
that
this
would
be
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
they
have?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it
was
denied
by
the
commission
that
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
they
figure
it
was
the
kind
that
would
be
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
know,
all
i
meant
to
get
out
was
that
if
these
people
went
before
the
commission,
there's
no
(inaudible)
that
they
would
not
be
--
you
wouldn't
take
issue
with
the
claim
whether
they
are
entitled
to
have
it
or
not,
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
cross-examine
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
issue
about
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
part
of
the
congress
enactment,
the
government's
position
would
be
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
one
was
to
agree
to
your
view,
congress
intended
(inaudible)
and
institute
this
response
say,
it
would
be.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
we
reach
the
constitutional
question
here
or
do
we
send
back
to
the
district
court
to
reach
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
a
three-judge
court,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
never
got
to
this
--
never
--
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
involve
that
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
one
of
these
complainants
wanted
a
public
session
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
the
appelant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
commission
--
where
a
defamatory
testimony,
so-called,
is
not
involved?
does
it
have
discretion
to
have
a
whole
private
hearing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
way
i
read
it
was,
perhaps
this
is
wrong,
that
in
case
of
defamatory
testimony,
it's
mandatory
to
hold
an
executive
session
and
that
it
was
open
apparently,
one
way
or
the
other,
for
non-defamatory
cases.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
know
what
the
practice
of
the
commission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
i
was
thinking
of
was
the
situation
where
a
complaining
witness
said,
“well,
i
don't
want
to
testify
in
public.
i
don't
mind
giving
the
commission
information
in
private,
but
i
don't
want
to
be
testifying
in
public.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
mean
that
a
private
session,
a
private
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they'd
have
authority
to
do
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
i
assume.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
can
i
ask
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
me
about
this
so-called
defamatory
witness,
i
would
suppose
that
any
witness
who
had
a
complaint
that
he'd
been
deprived
to
his
voting
rights
is
of
necessity,
a
defamatory
witness.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
i
don't
understand
what
kind
of
testimony
is
put
on
in
public
hearings.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
an
example
of
the
defamatory
statements,
that
would
lead
to
in
examining
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
has
the
commission
put
on
public
hearings
as
evidence
that
negroes
are
freely
allowed
to
vote?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
there
is
only
instances
were
they're
not
allowed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
it
alleges
to
--
that
alleges
to
be
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
assuming
therefore,
i
don't
still
don't
understand
the
distinction
between
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
defamatory
and
non-defamatory
testimony.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
how
many
public
hearings
have
been
held
by
the
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
how
many
private
hearings
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
two.
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
we
--
you
don't
know.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
congress
sent
down
its
own
subcommittee
to
louisiana
and
it
conducted
these
hearings
in
the
same
way,
what
would've
been
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
your
point
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
was
just
trying
to
fragmentize
the
issues
here,
but
i
understood
it.
you
--
if
this
had
been
a
congressional
committee
itself
and
that
it
acted
the
same
way
that
you
say
this
committee
--
this
committee
had
acted
--
this
commission
has
acted,
you
say
you'd
have
no
grievance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
your
point
really
is
one
of
unlawful
delegation
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
this
committee.
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
--
that's
the
essence
to
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
members
of
this
commission
have
been
appointed
by
the
congress,
instead
of
by
the
president,
what
would
be
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
congress
passed
this
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
your
position
would've
been
a
different
position
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
shaw
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me,
go
ahead,
finish
your
--
finish
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
your
complaining
witness
comes
into
your
office,
district
attorney
x
complain
against
mr.
x,
you
take
an
affidavit
from
the
complaining
witness
proceed
to
investigate
and
you
proprietary
taking
case
for
the
grand
jury
and
the
lawyer
for
the
complaining
witness
comes
in
--
a
lawyer
for
the
perspective
defendant
comes
in,
and
says
“i
would
like
to
see
all
of
the
papers
that
you
got
in
your
file,
mr.
--
mr.
attorney.”
would
you
give
it
to
him?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
normal
procedure?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
--
how
can
congress
do
that
if
their
claims
are
incorrect
and
unconstitutional?
