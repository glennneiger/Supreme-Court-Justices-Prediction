mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
both
arise
in
the
western
district
of
louisiana.
one
is
before
you
on
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
in
that
district
and
other
is
before
you
on
petition
for
certiorari
in
advance
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
reviewing
a
one-judge
decision
--
one-judge
judgment
in
the
same
district.
the
reason
that
we
have
asked
and
our
opponents
have
not
opposed
bringing
the
one-judge
case
along
at
the
same
time
is
that
the
judgments
in
both
cases
are
identical
and
the
--
the
--
all
of
the
issues
in
the
one-judge
case
are
included
within
those
of
the
three-judge
case.
both
judgments
enjoin
the
civil
rights
commission
from
holding
a
hearing
in
the
state
of
louisiana
with
respect
to
voting
--
with
--
with
respect
to
racial
discrimination
in
the
administration
of
the
election
laws
unless
the
commission
permits
independent
cross-examination
of
the
witnesses
by
counsel
for
the
various
voting
registrars
and
others
who
may
be
adversely
affected
by
that
testimony.
adversely
affected
in
the
sense
of
(inaudible)
or
--
or
shame.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
larche
case
are
all
registrars
in
various
counties
in
louisiana,
mostly
in
the
northwestern
part
of
the
state.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
slawson
case
are
private
individuals.
one
is
a
former
registrar
and
the
other
five
are
persons
who
have
been
active
in
connection
with
challenging
registrants
in
--
in
purging
from
the
registers,
persons
who
had
already
registered
upon
grounds
which
are
usually
highly
technical.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
two
citizens,
i
believe,
are
required
for
us
to
the
challenge.
there
are
two
registered
voters,
i
should
say,
as
mr.
--
as
the
attorney
general
points
out.
both
sets
of
plaintiffs
have
asked
the
court
--
asked
the
court
below
for
relief
in
two
capacities
as
prospective
witnesses
themselves
and
as
persons
who
anticipated
being
defamed
by
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses
who
testified.
the
court
below,
judge
wisdom
dissenting,
granted
the
injunction
and
its
theory
was
that
these
persons
are
really
under
investigation
for
a
criminal
misconduct
that
they're
subject
to
loss
of
office,
if
in
fact,
they
did
commit
a
crime.
and
that
in
any
event,
they're
subject
to
public
opprobrium
and
scorn.
and
that
therefore,
greene
against
mcelroy
governs.
and
that
under
the
greene
case,
it
is
assumed
that
congress
intended
to
require
the
civil
rights
commission
to
permit
independent
cross-examination
of
these
witnesses
and
also
confrontation
and
appraisal
of
the
charges
which
were
--
were
to
be
the
subject
of
the
hearing.
and
that
inasmuch
as
congress
did
not,
in
expressed
negative
terms
say
that
no
such
cross-examination
was
required.
the
court
interprets
the
statute
to
require
such
independent
cross-examination.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
civil
rights
commission's
rules
of
procedure
which
limit
cross-examination
to
members
of
the
commission
and
the
commission
staff
was
held
in
variance
with
the
statute
and
this
made
it
unnecessary
for
the
court
below
to
go
to
the
constitutional
question,
because
it
felt
the
injunction
was
justified
because
the
rules
of
the
commission
were
not
in
accord
with
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
is
the
only
question
decided
except
it
also
held
that
these
--
that
the
commission
should
let
the
witnesses
--
these
--
these
witnesses
--
these
plaintiffs,
know
in
advance,
the
precise
complaints
which
were
to
be
the
subject
of
the
hearing.
in
other
words,
to
let
them
see
the
written
complaints,
what
the
commission
had
received.
the
other
question
decided
below
was
to
hold
the
civil
rights
commission
--
that
--
to
the
statute,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957,
insofar
as
it
established
the
commission
to
be
a
constitutional
exercise
of
congress'
power.
the
plaintiffs
had
challenged
that
as
a
--
as
a
proper
legislative
act
of
congress
on
the
theory
somewhat
the
same
as
in
the
raines
case,
which
was
argued
here
a
week
ago,
that
inasmuch
as
the
commission
was
not
limited
in
its
investigation
to
acts
of
state
officials
and
could
in
its
investigations
and
hearings
go
into
questions
of
acts
of
individuals
and
connects
with
--
in
connection
with
voting
violations
that
it
was
not
a
proper
legislative
purpose.
but
the
court
below
held
that
it
was
a
proper
legislative
purpose
and
held
it
in
favor
of
the
commission
to
that
extent.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
opinions
is
at
the
very
end
of
the
record
and
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
printed
record
at
page
250.
and
the
issues
are
posed
that
--
in
this
way,
by
the
court
below.
and
this
is
after
the
court
had
held
the
statute,
the
act
constitutional
as
a
proper
exercise
of
legislative
power
said,
“the
remaining
pertinent
and
serious
questions
presented
maybe
as
stated.
one,
did
congress
in
creating
the
commission,
specifically
authorize
it
to
adopt
rules
for
investigations
conducted
under
section
104
(a)
(1)
of
the
act,
which
would
deprive
parties
investigated
of
their
rights
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination
and
their
right
to
be
apprised
of
the
charges
against
them.”
and
then
it
states
the
second
question
which
it
never
reached,
“if
congress
did
so
authorize
the
commission
and
such
authorization
constitutionally
permissible?
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
and
the
real
question.
and
the
position
of
the
commission
is
that
the
civil
rights
commission
has
a
duty
to
make
this
survey
for
congress.
it
has
no
power
whatever
to
act
adversely
to
any
of
the
--
of
the
plaintiffs.
it
can
decide
nothing
and
its
action
is
not
even
a
step
along
the
way
to
any
acts
and
adverse
to
the
plaintiffs.
and
therefore,
of
course,
greene
against
mcelroy
is
not
applicable
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
actually,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
anything
except
whether
you
have
--
except
to
assume
that
the
rules
deprived
him
of
the
right
to
independent
cross-examination.
i'm
sure
that
the
facts
will
show
in
this
case,
there's
no
denial
of
appraisal
or
confrontation.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no,
no.
the
--
the
rule
doesn't
mention
the
word
confrontation
at
all,
there
--
the
--
except
that
any
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it
does
deprive
them
of
their
right
of
cross-examination.
and
as
to
confrontation,
the
rules
require
that
in
any
case
where
the
commission
is
aware
that
a
person
will
be
defamed
by
the
testimony,
is
--
is
a
fair
play
rules
of
the
--
of
the
house
of
representatives,
that
he
must
--
that
the
testimony
must
be
taken
in
executive
session
and
the
person
adversely
affected
notified.
and
then
the
rules
go
further
and
require
that
the
person
adversely
affected
by
the
testimony
shall
receive
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
taken
in
executive
session.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no.
there's
no
--
no
challenge
to
the
use
of
the
executive
session
here
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no,
sir.no,
your
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
did
not.
the
--
the
commission
started
its
investigation
of
these
louisiana
complaints
and
on
the
eve
of
the
hearing,
friday
before
the
hearing
was
to
begin
on
the
next
monday,
this
restraining
order
was
issued
and
the
--
the
holding
of
the
hearing
enjoined.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
on
allegations
this
would
be
a
kind
of
hearing
it
would
have
and
it
would
cause
irreparable
damage
once
this
testimony
came
out.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
--
the
commission
denied
the
use
of
the
word
charges.
the
--
the
commission
conceded
that
a
substantial
number
of
these
complaints,
and
it
was
stipulated.
that
a
substantial
number
of
these
complaints
would
allege
a
deprivation
of
the
right
to
vote
because
of
race
through
the
acts
of
these
plaintiff
registrars,
but
there
was
no
other
concession
as
to
the
nature
of
the
charges
or
to
--
this
about
losing
jobs
or
criminal
danger
of
criminal
prosecution
or
any
of
those
things.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
oh,
there's
no
--
no
issue
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
rules
are
expressed
in
that
respect.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well,
now,
i
believe
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
mr.
justice
whittaker,
we
mean
that
they
did
not
have
such
a
right.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
of
their
--
their
claimed
right,
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
--
that's
the
issue
and
the
--
the
position
of
the
commission
--
the
further
position
is
that
even
if
we
applied
greene
standards
here,
they've
been
met,
whereas
this
court
in
the
greene
case,
dealt
with
the
problem
of
--
of
assembling
fragments
to
find
authorization
for
what
the
secretary
of
defense
did.
here,
congress
has
left
nothing
to
anyone's
imagination.
it
has
set
forth
in
one
section
the
rules
of
procedure
to
be
followed
by
this
commission.
and
that
the
commission
has
followed
them
and
indeed
liberalized
them
to
some
extent.
the
--
the
facts
as
they
occurred
just
before
i
get
to
the
statute
and
go
through
it
with
care,
it
might
help
you
to
have
--
that
seems
to
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no,
the
--
they
are
not
being
asked
--
they
--
there's
nothing
--
no
question
of
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination
here
at
all.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
danger
of
defamation
from
other
witnesses
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
from
--
from
persons
who
were
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
--
it's
aimed
at
--
at
both.
they
say
that
they
have
no
right
to
be
called
in
as
witnesses
because
they
haven't
seen
the
written
complaints
and
to
see
exactly
what
the
complainant
said
about.
and
they
say
that
they're
--
that
the
commission
has
no
right
to
hold
this
public
hearing
because
they
are
not
in
the
position
to
protect
themselves,
by
independent
cross-examination.
that's
the
--
the
essence
i
think
of
the
two
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
is
their
--
their
claim.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
they
--
as
that
the
facts
will
show,
have
been
very
well
told,
exactly
what
their
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
groban
case
went
beyond
our
present
case,
because
in
--
in
the
groban
case,
there
--
there
was
some
danger
of
prosecution.
and
in
investigating
the
cause
of
fire,
there
were
some
fear
by
the
plaintiff
that
he
might
be
the
subject
of
ultimate
criminal
action.
and
further
in
the
groban
case,
as
i
remember
it,
there
was
an
element
of
secrecy,
none
of
that
is
here.
this
commission
has
no
power
to
do
anything
and
as
your
honors
have
a
chance
to
see
their
report
on
louisiana
and
the
statute
which
set
them
up,
you
will
realize
that
this
commission
had
no
interest
in
these
registrars
as
individuals
in
the
sense
of
targets
at
all
that
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
but
we
--
we
--
i
--
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
we
believe
that
groban
is
a
fortiori
in
our
favor
that
--
that
we
are
well
within
the
holding
of
the
--
of
the
court
in,
in
re
groban.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
in
other
words
--
well,
we
could
even
satisfy
the
standards
of
the
dissent.
i
believe
in,
in
re
groban.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
it
was.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
ohio
statute.
the
--
the
commission
was
established
in
1957,
and
just
to
tell
you
how
this
controversy
arose,
it
divided
its
fields
of
activity
into
three,
voting,
housing
and
education.
we're
concerned
only
with
voting.
under
the
statute,
the
commission
is
required
to
investigate
every
sworn
complaint
as
to
discrimination
and
voting.
and
in
--
it
started
out
with,
i
think,
some
600
odd
complaints
throughout
the
country.
it
went
to
alabama
first,
because
it
had
the
most
complaints
there.
the
next
state
was
louisiana
where
it
had
63
or
so
complaints.
the
commission
did
not
want
to
hold
a
hearing.
the
--
it
has
this
duty
to
investigate,
but
no
mandatory
duty
to
hold
a
hearing.
and
the
--
having
received
the
complaints
and
checked
the
louisiana
statutes
to
find
that
louisiana
does
have
a
literacy
test
which
is
an
extremely
difficult
one,
requiring
voters
to
explain
sections
of
the
constitution
to
the
subjective
satisfaction
of
the
registrars
in
checking
the
statutes
and
the
statistics
released
by
the
state's
secretary
of
state
to
show
the
pattern
of
registration
and
seeing
a
gross
disparity
in
some
parishes
between
the
population
figures,
between
white
and
negro
and
the
registration
figures
between
white
and
negro.
it
arrived
at
a
point
where
it
had
to
see
the
registrars'
records
in
those
parishes
to
do
a
job
for
congress
and
also
had
to
ask
the
registrars
for
explanations,
if
they
would
give
them.
and
beginning
in
january
of
1959
and
lasting
through
until
june
of
1959,
mr.
gordon
tiffany,
who
was
the
staff
director
of
the
commission,
conducted
extended
negotiations
with
attorney
general
gremillion
of
louisiana
in
the
hope
that
this
information
could
be
obtained
without
the
time
and
expense
of
a
public
hearing.
the
commissioners,
i
might
add,
are
not
fulltime
government
officers.
they
are
all
men
with
fulltime
private
occupations,
who
give
one
or
two
days
a
month
or
whatever
additional
time
may
be
needed
to
this
work.
and
the
life
of
the
commission
was
running
out
with
--
and
the
--
there
was
a
question
of
whether
this
--
it
could
hold
another
hearing
on
housing
and
because
of
the
impossibility
of
reaching
a
voluntary
solution
here,
this
hearing
was
held.
i
mention
all
these
just
to
allay
at
the
outset
any
thought
of
exposure
for
exposure's
sake.
this
commission
didn't
want
to
hold
a
hearing
and
the
only
reason
for
it
is
that
it
felt
that
it
had
to
hold
a
hearing
to
use
its
subpoenaing
power
which
ultimately
had
to
come
into
play,
because
it
couldn't
get
this
information
voluntarily.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
these
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
if
--
if
it's
done
by
--
by
conspiracy,
your
honor
and
that,
i
think,
section
242
of
title
18,
deals
with
that
subject.
in
all
those
cases,
there
will
be
a
question
of
--
of
intent
and
the
--
and
louisiana
also
has
statutes,
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
willfully
disobey
its
election
law.
so
there
--
there
are
criminal
statutes
which
would
be
available
for
prosecution.
all
of
them
had
elements
of
willfulness
or
intent
and
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggest
that
any
complaint
before
the
commission
alleges
willfulness
or
intent
or
any
such
thing
that
--
the
commission
had
were
grievances.
people
who
say
i
thought
i
was
entitled
to
vote.
i
went
to
the
registrar
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
in
the
report
of
the
commission,
the
substance
of
--
of
this
type
of
complaint
is
available.
i
went
to
the
registrar
and
he
asked
me
to
read
a
section
of
the
constitution,
said
it
didn't
satisfy
him
and
i
--
i
went
back
a
second
time
and
tried
to
do
it
and
still
didn't
satisfy
him
and
i
came
home.
it's
so
--
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
record
which
justifies
the
inference
that
these
people
were
being
investigated
in
any
way
leading
to
criminal
prosecution.
the
entire
record
and
the
entire
report
of
the
commission
is
that
of
a
group
trying
to
get
an
overall
picture
of
a
--
of
a
national
problem
to
fulfill
its
duty
of
reporting
to
congress.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
if
a
person
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
if
a
person
felt
he
might
be
subject
to
--
to
criminal
prosecution,
would
have
the
problem
of
--
of
mcgrain
against
daugherty
where
a
legislative
investigation
would
incidentally
--
might
incidentally
disclose
a
misconduct
for
a
crime
by
a
person
who
was
a
subject
to
the
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no,
that
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
but
that
the
commission
was
excluding
this
--
the
possibility
of
willfulness?
no
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no,
sir.
no.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
--
i'm
sorry
if
i
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
but
the
--
after
receiving
the
complaints,
the
--
the
commission
tried
to
arrange
interviews
with
the
registrars
and
get
the
information
that
way
and
then
when
that
failed,
they
tried
to
negotiate
out
a
series
of
interrogatories.
and
they
actually
sent
out
to
the
registrars
a
--
a
series
of
interrogatories
with
300
odd
questions
which
laid
out
explicitly
and
in
the
greatest
detail,
the
points
as
to
which
they
were
curious
and
the
hope
that
by
this
means
they
could
get
the
information
which
would
explain
or
put
in
the
proper
perspective
these
complaints,
which
they'd
receive.
at
this
point,
your
honors,
that
if
i
--
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
direct
attention
to
the
statute
which
set
up
the
commission.so
that
it's
--
it's
the
limitations
on
its
powers
might
be
apparent
to
all
of
us
as
--
as
we
consider
the
adequacy
of
its
procedures.
and
at
page
62,
in
the
record,
is
the
act
--
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957,
begins
at
page
59.
but
at
page
62,
in
section
104,
which
is
the
only
section
specifying
the
duties
of
the
commission
and
inferentially,
the
powers
of
the
commission.
you'll
see
that
breaks
into
the
three
subjects
that
it's
to
--
required
to
investigate
sworn
charges
that
persons
who
were
deprived
of
their
right
to
vote
by
--
because
of
race.
and
that
it's
required
to
study
and
collect
information
concerning
legal
developments
denying
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
three,
to
appraise
the
laws
and
policies
of
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
and
all
that
it
can
do
ultimately
is
set
forth
in
subparagraph
(b)
which
requires
it
to
report
to
the
president
and
to
the
congress
its
activities,
findings
and
recommendations.60
days
after
it
reports,
it's
--
it
ceases
to
exist,
so
that's
all
that
it
can
do.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
now,
i
think
that's
decisive
as
far
as
any
reference
to
the
greene
case
is
concerned.
because
in
the
greene
case,
it
was
conceded
that
the
action
of
the
--
of
the
administrator
caused
the
loss
of
a
person's
employment.
and
it's
further
that
it
limited
his
field
of
employment.
and
that
--
it
was
in
the
--
in
the
greene
case,
there
was
an
adjudication
which
whether
agreed
with
or
not
or
whether
persuasive
or
not,
prevented
a
man
from
having
that
which
he
needed
in
order
to
work.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
think
that
--
your
--
your
honor,
i
would
believe
that
such
a
statute
could
be
sustained
with
the
same
procedures.
but
there
would
be
there
a
greater
danger
because
the
object
of
the
commission
would've
been
narrowed
to
those
acts
which
are
criminal
and
it
would
be
clear
that
it
and
its
findings
was
passing
in
a
sense,
on
a
question
of
someone
--
whether
someone
had
committed
a
crime
or
not.
whereas
here,
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
commission
is
doing
that
in
its
report
to
the
extent
that
it's
been
complete
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well,
that
--
that
in
louisiana,
mr.
justice
black,
it's
--
it's
not
--
it's
not
too
easy
to
equate
the
denial
of
registration
with
a
crime,
because
it
has
these
statutes
which
requires
that
a
register
--
an
application
for
registration
satisfy
the
registrar
as
to
his
interpretation
of
a
provision
--
of
any
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
louisiana
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
--
the
range
of
judgment
that
is
open
there
to
the
registrar
and
the
difficulty
to
the
application
--
to
the
--
to
the
applicant
is
such
that
i
--
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
number
of
cases
in
which
a
complainant
might
feel
that
he
was
being
denied
his
right
to
vote
because
of
his
race.
whereas
in
--
when
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
proving
a
crime
against
the
registrar.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
exactly,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
--
that
is
it.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
--
i
think
[laughs]
it
would
--
i
think
it
would
justify
the
reversal
of
this
case
because
that
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
--
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
or
not
--
and
--
and
i
go
further
and
not
even
a
preliminary
step
toward
a
--
an
adjudication.
it's
not
a
step
in
the
chain
of
judgment
as
an
indictment
is
in
the
chain
of
prosecution.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no.
the
--
i
think,
this
case
is
--
is
in
a
sense
--
the
--
the
procedures
in
this
case
are
less
hazardous
to
the
point
of
view
on
which
i
am
being
questioned
than
those
of
an
indictment
where
a
man
is
under
charges
and
as
i
--
on
the
road
to
prosecution,
he
has
no
right
to
cross-examination.
he
has
no
right
to
know
what's
going
on
in
the
grand
jury
or
what
complaints
are
in
the
office
of
the
u.s.
attorney,
whereas
here,
these
people
are
in
no
danger
through
--
through
this
agency
of
prosecution
at
all.
this
agency's
report
will
have
no
bearing
--
nothing
that
this
agency
says
will,
as
a
matter
of
official
action,
have
any
bearing
on
what
element
they
have
as
to
these
people.
this
--
this
commission
has
no
--
no
status
to
communicate
officially
with
any
prosecutor.
its
communications
are
to
the
president
and
to
the
congress.
the
commission's
objects
are
--
when
--
when
read
in
--
read
together
are
clearly
the
--
those
of
making
a
report
on
which
legislation
can
be
based.
so
i
--
i
think
that
the
analogy
of
the
indictment
is
--
is
a
good
one
and
again,
like
the
reference
to
in
re
groban,
this
case
is
--
is
--
if
there
is
any
objection
to
this
of
sort
of
proceeding,
it's
not
subjection
but
a
matter
of
an
indictment.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
the
thrust,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
--
i
think
your
honor
that
we
could
--
could
claim
no
greater
duty
to
permit
a
cross-examination
--
independent
cross-examination
on
a
grand
jury.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
of
course
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it
seemed
to
me
that
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
think
in
--
in
fact
that
these
registrars
are
given
a
choice
as
to
which
agency
they
would
rather
have
look
into
them.
this
civil
rights
commission
or
a
grand
jury,
they
would
prefer
to
have
the
civil
rights
commission
do
it.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes
sir.
and
i
thought
your
honor
might
--
well,
to
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
statute
and
having
mentioned
the
duties
and
the
ultimate
function
of
the
commission,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
next
section,
the
means
to
the
end
are
set
forth
which
are
a
full
time
staff,
advisory
committees
and
the
use
of
public
hearings
with
subpoenaing
power.
that's
--
that's
the
entire
range
of
their
--
and
in
connection
with
the
hearings
at
page
60
of
the
record,
it
is
section
102
(a)
in
which
congress
expressly
sets
forth
the
rules
of
procedure
which
is
to
govern
the
commission.
and
here,
assuming
arguendo
that
greene
does
have
some
application,
is
the
answer
to
the
test
which
this
court
put
in
greene,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
careful
and
deliberate
consideration
given
to
the
question
of
what
procedure
should
be
followed
and
whether
these
can
set
forth
expressly.
and
in
this
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no,
it's
60,
your
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
mr.
justice
black,
page
60.
now,
let
--
it's
102
(a).
and
there
--
are
set
forth
there
11
rules
of
--
of
procedure.
these
are
--
an
adaptation
of
the
house
of
representatives,
so-called,
“fair
play”
rules
which
govern
their
--
their
standing
committees.
and
the
--
the
subdivisions
which
i
think
would
interest
the
court
at
this
moment
are
the
first
which
requires
the
chairman
to
announce
it
in
his
opening
statement,
the
subject
for
the
hearing
and
then
subdivision
(c)
which
deals
with
this
precise
question.
“witnesses
at
the
hearings
may
be
accompanied
by
their
own
counsel
for
the
purpose
of
advising
them
concerning
their
constitutional
rights.”
and
then
subdivision
(e)
which
provides
that
the
--
if
the
commission
determines
that
evidence
or
testimony
may
tend
to
defame,
degrade
or
incriminate,
it
shall
receive
such
evidence
in
executive
session
and
afford
the
person
an
opportunity
to
voluntarily
appear
as
a
witness
and
to
receive
and
dispose
of
his
request
for
additional
subpoenas.
i
don't
believe
any
of
the
other
subdivisions
bear
on
this
--
this
problem.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
--
that
question
wasn't
raised,
your
honor,
but
the
--
the
whole
purpose
of
the
executive
session
is
to
protect
the
person
who's
--
who's
subject
to
defamation.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
there
--
there
might
be
two
--
two
persons
in
that
position.
one,
the
complainant,
who's
--
who's
told
that
your
testimony
will
probably
defame
registrar
x,
so
you
must
testify
in
executive
session.
if
he
refused
to
so
testify,
i
think
he
would
be
guilty
of
contempt.
the
other
person
would
be
the
registrar
himself.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
--
i
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no.
oh,
the
registrar
--
there's
no
--
no
power
to
compel
him
to
testify
in
the
executive
session.
it's
only
the
person
who
might
defame
the
registrar
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
can
be
compelled
to
testify
in
the
executive
session.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
it
is.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it's
in
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
there's
no
such
--
no
--
no
such
expressed
provision.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
except
that
--
the
--
that
under
the
subpoenaing
power,
excuse
me,
your
honor,
on
page
64,
subdivision
(g)
of
section
104
provided
in
case
of
contumacy
or
refusal
to
obey
a
subpoena,
served
for
the
district
court,
may
on
application
of
the
attorney
general,
first
order
them
to
appear
and
then
if
they
fail
to
appear,
they
are
--
may
be
punished
for
contempt
by
the
district
court's
order.
the
--
the
commission
itself
has
no
contempt
power.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
--
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
that
would
be
covered
by
in
a
case
of
contumacy.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
there's
no
--
no
punishment
fixed
except
that
the
punishment
of
the
--
of
the
--
for
the
contempt
of
the
court's
order.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it's
the
--
the
limits
that
apply
to
--
to
a
united
states
district
court,
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
fixed
limits.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
none
--
none
fixed
in
this
answer.
going
from
the
statute
now,
the
rules
of
the
commission
--
we'd
came
from
at
it,
may
begin
on
page
55
of
the
record.
but
the
first
--
first
two
sections
don't
--
the
first
section
has
no
bearing
on
this,
i
don't
think.
and
section
2
and
56
really
merely
restates
the
statute.
because
these
rules
were
designed
to
be
given
to
each
witness
as
he
testifies,
so
2,
includes
the
statute.
and
then
the
real
implementing
rules
are
found
in
section
3
which
begins
on
page
57.
your
honors,
would
turn
over
to
page
58
and
look
at
subdivision
(i)
you'll
find
the
regulation
which
is
the
heart
of
this
controversy
which
provides
that
--
interrogates
any
witnesses
at
hearings
shall
be
conducted
only
by
members
of
the
commission
or
by
authorized
staff
personnel.
the
--
or
the
--
the
commission's
theory
in
adopting
this
rule
was
that
the
statute,
section
102,
adopted
a
complete
code
of
procedures
for
it
to
follow.
that
it
was
parallel
to
the
fair
play
rules
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
that
the
interpretation
which
those
--
these
rules
had
received
where
it
be
the
--
and
must
be
the
interpretation
followed
by
the
commission.
and
in
addition,
i
might
point
out
that
section
102,
subdivision
(c)
does
have
the
express
limitation
attached
to
the
right
of
counsel.
it
says,
“witnesses
at
the
hearings
may
be
accompanied
by
their
counsel
and
then
for
the
purpose
of
advising
them
concerning
their
constitutional
rights.”
an
act
of
the
commission
was
an
implied
limitation
of
a
requirement
on
the
commission
to
--
to
permit
them
to
exercise
any
other
function.
but
the
real
support
for
the
commission's
position
lies
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
is
extensive,
which
is
harmonious
and
which
was
complete,
which
was
barely
fought
out
so
that
there's
nothing
here
left
to
speculation
as
to
whether
congress
knew
and
deliberately
made
this
choice
or
whether
it
didn't.
now,
we
have
in
our
reply
brief
at
the
very
end,
an
appendix
which
covers
most
of
it,
but
unfortunately
not
all
of
it.
and
if
i
may
try
the
patience
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
try
to
put
together
in
--
in
the
coherent
and
chronological
sequence.
the
controversy
over
civil
rights
really
began
in
--
at
least
it
came
to
a
boil
in
1956,
the
year
before
the
act
was
enacted.
and
at
that
time,
the
--
the
house
passed
a
civil
rights
act
and
on
--
and
as
it
was
at
the
brink
of
passage,
congressman
dies
introduced
a
--
an
amendment
which
provided
for
the
procedure
to
be
followed
by
the
commission.
now,
the
dies
amendment
which
will
figure
through
the
subsequent
history
is
found
in
our
main
brief
at
page
64.
actually,
it
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
63,
but
the
text
is
on
page
64.
and
a
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
just
the
next
to
the
last
page
of
the
brief.
and
on
the
left-hand
page,
your
honor
will
see
subdivision
(s)
which
provides
that
“if
a
person
is
adversely
affected
by
evidence
or
testimony
given
in
a
public
hearing,
that
person
shall
have
the
right
to
do
these
various
things.”
and
then
if
you
look
at
subdivision
iv
of
(s),
there
is
the
expressed
right
to
cross-examine
in
person
or
by
counsel,
such
adverse
witness.
that
was
the
rider
which
was
put
into
the
bill
in
1956.
that
bill
did
not
pass
the
senate.
and
so
the
following
year,
in
1957,
again,
the
activity
started
to
pass
the
civil
rights
bill.
in
the
senate,
a
bill
was
introduced
by
senator
dirksen,
the
minority
with
--
cosponsored
by
over
half
of
the
minority
members.
it
was
a
major
vehicle
for
the
consideration
of
this
subject.
that
bill
had
this
identical
language
of
the
dies
--
dies
rider
in
it.
and
senate
83
which
is
senator
dirksen's
bill
is
found
in
an
appendix
to
judge
wisdom's
dissent
at
the
very
end
of
the
record
page
270.
i
apologize
for
the
scattered
nature
of
this
page
--
it
actually
begins
on
page
269
of
the
record.
and
then
if
you
turn
over
the
page
to
page
270,
you'll
find
there
again
subdivision
(s),
the
identical
provision
that
was
in
the
dies
rider.
there
were
hearings
held
on
this
--
on
s.83
and
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
10.
most
--
everything
else
is
in
the
reply
brief.
i'm
sorry,
but
we
got
a
few
things.
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
10
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
is
attorney
general
brownell's
comment
with
respect
to
this
procedure.
he
is
talking
about
s.83
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
he
said
--
now
there's
one
other
addition
to
the
s.83
that
i
would
like
to
make
special
reference
to.
and
that
is
the
provision
for
rules
of
procedure
contained
in
section
102
on
pages
2,
10
of
s.83.
“these
rules
of
procedure
are
considerably
more
restrictive
than
those
imposed
on
regular
committees
of
the
house
and
senate.
there
is
much
in
them
which
clearly
would
be
desirable.
we
have
not
as
yet
had
any
experience
with
the
use
of
rules
such
as
those
proposed
here.
and
we
cannot
predict
the
extent
to
which
they
might
be
used
to
obstruct
the
work
of
the
commission.”
then
he
says
how
he
favors
such
rules
that
--
and
then
he
goes
on
one
paragraph
further
down.
“that
i
feel
that
the
task
to
be
given
to
this
commission
is
of
such
great
public
importance
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
make
it
the
vehicle
for
experimenting
with
new
rules
which
may
have
to
be
tested
out
under
the
courts.”
and
this
is
only
a
two-year
commission.
and
you
might
have
to
spend
those
two
years
studying
the
rules
instead
of
getting
at
the
facts.
well
senate
83
kept
those
rules.
it
was
reported
by
its
subcommittee
to
the
main
--
to
the
full
judiciary
committee,
but
it
never
got
any
further
because
parallel
with
it,
there
started
in
the
house,
the
bill
which
ultimately
became
law.
and
that
there
were
two
bills,
started
by
congressman
celler
and
one
by
congressman
keating,
they
--
the
chairman
and
the
minority
--
the
senior
minority
member
of
the
judiciary
committee.
they
merged
as
h.r.6127,
and
the
procedure
in
that
bill
is
the
procedure
that
is
now
in
the
statute.
it
--
they
--
that
--
those
bills
from
their
inception
had
the
so-called
fair
play
rules
in
them,
and
in
this
respect,
the
attorney
general
was
called
before
the
senate,
but
before
the
house
judiciary
committee
and
asked
about
the
dies
amendment.
and
his
comment
begins
on
--
on
this
particular
bill
that
ultimately
became
law,
begins
at
the
bottom
page
11
of
the
reply
brief.
the
bill
he's
talking
about
there
is
h.
r.
627
of
1956
which
is
unfortunately,
left
out
for
the
brief.
and
again,
he
says
the
same
thing
that
he
did
in
the
senate.
that
the
--
that
--
that
the
dies
rider
was
more
restrictive
and
that
he
thought
that
the
members
of
the
commission
would
be
men
of
such
stature
that
the
congress
would
not
have
to
use
this
as
a
vehicle
for
its
experimentation.
and
the
bill
came
out
of
judiciary
committee
with
the
fair
play
rules
in
it.
it
was
the
--
so
that
we
had
in
the
house,
one
bill
with
the
fair
play
rules
in
it
and
we
had
in
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
senate,
the
other
bill
with
the
dies
rules
in
it
which
we
have
expressly
required
independent
cross-examination.
the
house
bill
passed
and
--
but
not
without
--
without
complaint,
because
the
--
the
--
the
minority
report
of
the
judiciary
committee
complained.
it
says,
“the
rules
provided
in
the
bill
are
inadequate
for
more
than
one
reason.
first,
the
house
itself
in
the
84th
session
--
that's
in
1956,
saw
fit
to
--“
i'm
reading
from
the
reply
brief
the
bottom
of
page
12,
“saw
fit
to
adopt
a
set
of
rules
that
are
more
detailed
and
stricter
than
those
contained
in
the
bill.”
that
are
protection
of
the
rights
of
all
were
provided
for
more
orderly
procedure.
the
membership
of
the
house
wisely
imposed
its
own
judgment
on
that
of
the
committee.
and
then
he
says
if
--
the
--
the
--
the
minority
report
says
that
we
should
--
there
were
complaints
of
the
dies
rider
was
not
included.
and
then
when
it
got
on
the
floor,
congressman
keating
and
congressman
celler
both
spoke
in
support
of
it.
their
comments
are
on
pages
13
and
14
in
the
reply
brief.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
13,
you'll
see
where
congressman
celler
says,
“the
rules
of
procedure
for
this
commission
are
the
same
as
those
for
the
committees
of
that
house.”
and
then
on
page
14
at
the
top,
congressman
keating
says,
“investigations
by
the
commission
will
be
bound
by
the
rules
of
procedure,
modeled
after
those
applicable
congressional
committees.”
then
the
opponents
took
up.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
15,
congressman
kilday
attacked
the
bill
in
this
fashion.
“the
bill
provides
that
witnesses
may
be
accompanied
by
counsel,
for
what
purpose?
for
the
purpose
of
advising
them
concerning
their
constitutional
rights,
that
is
all.
even
though
the
commission
or
its
own
counsel
develops
only
a
portion
of
the
transaction
and
that
adverse
to
the
witness,
his
lawyer
cannot
ask
a
single
question
to
develop
the
remainder
of
the
transaction
or
the
--
or
the
portions
favorable
to
it.”
and
then
in
the
senate,
after
the
house
--
the
house
passed
its
bill,
for
these
procedures.
and
then
in
the
senate,
the
senate
took
up
the
house
bill
instead
of
its
own.
and
it
--
the
bill
was
then
attacked
senator
talmadge
on
page
18
of
the
reply
brief
and
in
which
he
--
he
said
that,
“no
provision
is
made
for
persons
adversely
affected
by
testimony
taken
by
the
commission
to
be
present
when
they
are
accused
or
later
to
confront
and
cross-examine
their
accusers.”
and
then
senator
stennis
on
page
19,
said,
he
has
no
--
speaking
of
the
witness
or
of
the
person
defamed.
he
said,
“he
has
no
right
of
confrontation
or
cross-examination
and
his
request
to
subpoenaing
witnesses
on
his
behalf
falls
within
the
arbitrary
discretion
of
the
commission.”
so,
your
honors,
it
seemed
to
the
commission
that
first
of
all,
the
statute
told
them
what
to
do.
they
had
to
allow
a
man
to
have
counsel
to
advise
him
as
to
his
constitutional
rights.
the
--
that
subdivision
of
the
statute
limited
the
usefulness
of
counsels
so
far
as
congress
required
it
and
that
congress
in
its
debates
had
indicated
that
that
it
thought
the
commission
was
being
authorized
to
proceed
--
oh,
in
the
fashion
which
it
now
is.
i
might
say
there's
nothing
in
the
record
of
the
--
of
the
passage
of
this
bill
to
the
contrary.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
but,
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
view
of
the
limited
life
of
this
commission
and
the
fact
that
it
--
although
it's
had
one
extension
of
two
years,
it's
now,
well,
into
that
--
those
two
years.
it
would
be
the
hope
of
the
commission
that
this
court
would
--
would
reach
it
here.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it's
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
court
of
appeals
is
--
is
not
involved
in
--
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
that
--
that
wasn't
raised
in
the
slawson
case.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
550
--
but
in
550,
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
they
merely
said
that
the
commission
didn't
follow
the
mandate
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes
he
would,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
practices
--
they
sit
right
next
to
each
other
and
counsel
can
whisper
in
the
witness'
ear
while
he
testifies.
so
there's
no
--
no
problem
in
that
regard.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
your
--
your
honor,
i
think
it
is.
in
fact,
i
think,
your
honors
as
--
as
you
view
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
actually,
your
honor
i
don't
--
don't
mean
to
be
(inaudible).
if
my
--
my
guess
would
be
that
if
cross-examination
were
allowed
here,
this
survey
which
the
commission
has
conducted,
would
be
personalized
and
would
end
up
in
a
cat
and
dog
fight
about
individual
registrars
instead
of
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
quoting
grievances.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well
--
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
i
--
let
me
say
this.
i
think
there
are
two
sides
to
it
and
i
--
and
if
i
were
--
if
i
were
the
registrar's
lawyer
and
i
was
interested
in
the
registrar,
not
making
an
issue
or
public
issue
on
whether
we
could
have
segregation
or
not.
i
think
that
i
would
prefer
to
have
the
commission
go
ahead
and
take
its
--
at
least
the
commission
is
taking
this
testimony
of
--
of
25
witnesses
in
the
morning.
it's
just
a
rapid
fire
succession
of
their
troubles.
and
it's
not
making
findings
as
to
individual
registrars
and
it
--
the
--
to
--
to
have
a
lawyer
come
into
it
to
cross-examine
each
of
these
witnesses,
develop
the
pros
and
cons
as
to
individual
registrars.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
registrar's
interest,
when
this
commission
has
no
interest
in
prosecuting
the
registrar.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
he
might
have
a
different
view.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
--
i
agree
with
you
that
9
out
of
10
would,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
there
--
i'm
sure
they
would,
because
there,
the
--
there's
no
--
no
danger
of
pinning
the
limelight
on
the
individual,
because
it's
already
pinned
on
him.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
your
--
your
honor
i
--
i
respectfully
--
the
difference
--
i
might
just
address
one
--
one
comment
to
that
for
that
point
that
many
--
many
administrative
agencies
are
in
the
position
to
cooperate
the
same
way
beside
grand
juries.
that
the
--
for
example,
there
--
one
of
the
cases
decided
by
mr.
justice
minton,
when
he
was
on
the
seventh
circuit
was
(inaudible)
against
bair,
which
was
referred
to
in
our
brief
at
page
38
--
excuse
me.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
thank
you.
he
--
he
--
there
the
o.p.a.
administrator,
through
his
agent
was
investigating
a
--
a
misuse
of
prices
by
throwing
in
the
customers
or
the
people
who
--
who
bought.
and
they
came
in
with
their
counsel.
and
the
administrator
told
counsel
to
get
out.
told
the
reporter
to
get
out
and
he
went
ahead
in
private
and
examined
these
persons
and
that
was
upheld
because
before
any
formal
action
was
taken,
they
would
all
have
their
chances
to
--
to
cross
examine
and
be
advised
by
counsel.
so
it's
not
just
grand
juries
or
--
or
forcing
groban
and
--
anonymous
against
baker
we
had
to
say
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well,
i
--
i
thought
maybe
i'd
satisfy
the
dissent
in
groban,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
very
little
to
add.
i
would
like
to
correct
one
statement
which
i
made
yesterday
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black
as
to
the
maximum
sentence
for
contempt
under
this
act.
i
overlooked
the
fact
that
section
151,
which
is
on
page
66
of
the
printed
record,
applies
to
the
entire
act.
that
section
is
in
part
4
which
the
department
of
justice
deals
with
and
i
had
overlooked
that
it
puts
a
six-month
limit
on
any
sentence
for
contempt
and
i
should
like
to
correct
my
statement
to
that
effect.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no.
page
60
--
page
66,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it's
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
--
that
can't
be.
in
the
--
in
the
proviso
beginning
at
line
3
of
that
section
--
line
4
of
that
section.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
page
66,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
he's
tried
without
a
jury,
it's
less,
your
honor
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
45
days.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
exactly,
your
honor.
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor,
i
simply
like
to
mention
very
briefly
confrontation
and
prior
apprisal,
because
as
i
indicated
at
the
beginning,
i
don't
think
the
facts
of
this
case
raise
those
issues,
but
i
would
just
--
inasmuch
as
the
court
below
became
concerned
with
them,
i
--
i
would
like
to
mention
them
very
briefly.
i
--
i
don't
see
how
confrontation
comes
in
here
at
all.
the
commission
wants
to
put
the
witnesses
on
the
stand
in
public.
and
it's
the
injunction
of
the
court
below
that
prevents
it.
the
only
way
confrontation
could
be
an
issue
would
be
if
the
commission,
on
secret
testimony,
issued
a
defamatory
statement
about
these
registrars.
now,
the
--
the
commission
doesn't
want
to
do
that
and
it's
limited
in
its
disclosure.
it's
public
disclosure
of
these
witnesses
and
their
identities
at
the
hearing
by
the
injunction
below.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it
was
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
exactly.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
record
shows
in
the
answer
in
the
slawson
case,
that
most
of
the
--
that
many
of
the
complaining
witnesses
were
going
to
be
called.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
and
the
prototype
for
the
hearing
is
found
in
the
civil
rights
commission
report
on
the
alabama
hearing
which
preceded
this.
and
the
way
it
works
was
that
the
--
the
complaining
witnesses
are
called
in
the
morning.
in
the
afternoon,
the
commission
holds
an
executive
session
as
to
defamatory
witnesses.
and
after
that,
the
registrars
are
those
who
might
be
expected
to
explain
the
problem
are
called
last.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
they
--
the
--
the
rules
of
the
commission,
as
to
the
executive
session,
do
not
provide
for
their
presence.
it
provides
that
they
must
be
furnished
a
transcript
of
what
the
witness
said
in
the
executive
session.
now,
in
practicality,
the
commission
is
perfectly
willing
to
have
them
present
because
it
will
save
time.
they
can
come
there
and
hear
the
witness
and
they
can
be
--
go
right
on
with
the
public
hearing.
so
that
would
be
the
way
the
commission
would
--
would
work
as
a
practical
matter.
but
if
the
--
the
--
if
the
registrar
insisted
on
a
written
transcript,
under
the
rules
of
the
commission,
he'd
be
entitled
to
it.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
--
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
all
right,
sir.
the
--
the
complainants
in
this
case,
as
again
the
report
from
the
commission
enough
shows
in
summary
fashion,
were
--
were
not
officials.
they
were
--
they
were
negroes
who
wished
to
vote.
and
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
oh
--
oh,
you
mean
the
plaintiffs
and
these
are
--
that
--
that
the
20
--
the
--
or
17
in
the
larche
case,
are
all
registrars.
the
six
in
the
slawson
case
are
all
private
citizens.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
as
to
--
these
people,
they
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
if
what
--
what
--
i
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
under
the
rules,
there's
no
provision
for
calling
them
in
executive
session.
the
rule
specified
that
the
executive
session
is
to
be
used
for
those
who
might
defame
others.
that's
the
stand
of
--
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
don't
think
the
complainant's
in
a
position
to
compel
that.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no.
no,
mr.
justice.
the
duty
of
the
commission
is
to
investigate
complaints.
there's
no
right
established
by
the
statute
of
any
person
to
have
a
public
hearing
on
his
complaint.
the
method
of
investigation
is
left
entirely
to
the
commission.
and
in
fact,
it
has
only
used
public
hearings,
when
it
has
been
necessary
to
compel
involuntary
testimony
or
at
least
in
--
in
this
--
in
this
matter.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
oh,
oh
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
well,
the
complaints
are
received.
the
first
thing
the
commission
does
is
--
is
check
the
formalities
of
the
statute,
if
they're
under
oath.
it
then
sends
into
the
field.
it's
--
well,
i'll
call
in
investigators,
although
they
have
a
--
a
better
word
for
it,
who
go
out
and
interview
the
complainant.
they
interview
persons
in
the
community,
to
find
out
about
the
complainant.
one,
does
he
have
voting
qualifications?
and
two,
is
he
a
reliable
person.
they
also
interview
others
in
the
community
to
find
out
whether
there's
any
--
any
breath
to
this
complaint.
is
this
a
chronic
problem?
after
that
preliminary
survey,
they
report
back
to
the
commission
and
then,
it
is
decided
in
the
light
of
the
statistics
that
i
mentioned
earlier
and
the
law
of
the
state,
whether
this
merits
further
--
further
check.
and
if
it
does,
there's
a
further
interview
of
these
witnesses,
in
preparation
for
the
hearing,
which
will
disclose
whether
their
testimony's
going
to
be
defamatory
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
don't
find
that
in
--
in
expressly
authorized
in
the
statute.
that
--
that
it
may
hold
a
private
hearing
of
its
own
choice.
the
statute
speaks
--
i
guess
about
58
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
practice
of
the
commission
would
--
would
not
be
to
hold
private
hearings,
except
voluntary
hearings.
for
example,
they
--
they
did
try
to
find
from
these
registrars
in
the
presence
of
their
counsel,
the
information
which
they
sought.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well,
they
--
they
could
certainly
take
his
testimony.
i
just
didn't
know
whether
that
would
rise
to
the
dignity
of
a
hearing.
they
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
they
could
have
--
they
could
have
private
session.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
and
--
and
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
they
do.
and
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
excuse
me,
mr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that's
right,
sir.
and
just
to
--
to
finish
the
--
he
will
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
at
the
bottom
of
page
63
as
the
hearing
authority
in
which
it
says
that,
“the
commission
--
and
--
and
if
we
drop
down
five
lines
in
subdivision
(f),
it
says
“hold
such
hearings
and
act
at
such
times
and
places
of
the
commission
or
other
authorized
subcommittee
may
deem
advisable.”
but
the
--
the
rules
of
procedure
speak
in
terms
of
a
public
hearing.
the
announcement
at
the
opening
of
the
session
of
the
purpose
and
all
those
--
those
requirements
suggest
a
public
hearing
as
far
as
any
involuntary
appearance
is
concerned.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
will
screen
out
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
i
--
i
think
i
follow
the
trust.
now,
there
is
a
sifting
process
and
complainants
who
are
non-defamatory,
that
they
feel
maybe
never
brought
to
light.
and
i
--
i
suppose
that
that
does
happen,
now,
they
conclude
that
a
complainant
is
--
is
unreliable,
they
are
no
going
to
put
him
on
the
stand
and
take
time
with
it.
but
the
--
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
are
in
no
way
injured
by
that.
no
one
ever
knows
the
complaint
was
made.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it
was
not
used.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
reason
for
nondisclosure
is
to
protect
the
reputations
of
independent
person
from
reckless
charges,
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
exactly.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
affidavit
was
the
first
step
that
preceded
the
investigation.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
only
if
a
public
hearing
is
deemed
necessary.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that's
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
exactly,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
that
witness
is
saved
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
until
the
others
have
testified.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir,
or
file
a
statement.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it
will
--
probably,
the
matters
of
mechanics
have
issued
the
subpoena
in
advance,
as
to
the
registrars,
because
it
needs
their
records.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.(inaudible)
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
or
they
were
--
they
could
listen
to
the
testimony
in
executive
session.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
to
save
the
time
of
transcription.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
at
the
time
the
testimony
was
taken
in
executive
session.
i
don't
think
this
is
actually
arisen,
but
i
--
that's
--
that
is
the
commission's
plan
to
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it's
not
in
the
rules
require
they're
giving
him
a
transcript.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
but
in
lieu
thereof,
that
would
be
the
commission's
plan
in
hoping
to
clean
this
up
in
one
day
or
two
days.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
to
--
to
say
the
time
of
transcription
by
letting
the
registrar
hear
the
testimony
in
executive
session
relating
to
him.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
for
prosecution
for
defense.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no,
i
--
i
appreciate
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
in
executive
session.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
--
that
is
not
--
not
any
rule
and
i'm
not
--
i
don't
--
i
think
it's
an
academic
question
so
far
in
the
commission's
existence,
but
it
--
it
is
there
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
that
i
don't
think
they
have
--
they
have
been
in
a
position
where
they
have
had
to
--
to
call
him.
i
mean
they've
been
--
both
had
a
defamatory
witness
and
the
pressure
of
time
that
would
require
them
to
tender
this
alternative.
that
is
their
--
their
plan
of
operation
under
the
--
under
the
circumstances
with
which
--
which
posed
to
me,
is
--
is
a
question.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i'm
only
in
the
position
to
state
that
from
what
the
board
told
me,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
and
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
--
i
think
--
i'm
--
i'm
worried
about
the
word
practice,
because
i
don't
know
that
has
happened
it
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
to
a
plan
or
that
their
plan
of
operation.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no.
no,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
think
to
--
at
times
a
--
a
foolish
extent
there
is
a
division
between
the
commission
and
the
department
of
justice.
the
congress
was
afraid
that
the
commission
would
be
used
as
a
fact-funneling
organization
for
the
department
and
so
we
have
both
bent
over
backward
to
stay
away
from
each
other
and
at
times
i
really
do
think
that
the
administration
both
of
our
jobs
is
--
has
suffered
as
a
result.
that
we
do
not
advise
them,
i
suppose
that
they
tendered
a
question
to
us,
we
would
answer
it
but
so
far
as
i
know,
they
have
not.
they
have
their
own
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
they
have
their
own
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
oh,
yes.
and
--
and
mr.
tiffany
who's
their
staff
director
is
a
former
attorney
general
in
new
hemisphere,
so
he's
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
in
the
executive
session,
i
would
advise
them,
yes,
sir.
because
as
i've
tried
to
indicate
yesterday,
they
are
trying
to
--
to
rapidly
survey
a
situation,
they
--
they
contemplate
calling
as
many
as
50
witnesses
in
a
day
or
day
and
a
half.
and
they
tried
to
--
if
there
were
any
number
of
defamatory
witnesses,
the
idea
of
transcribing
is
just
going
to
be
a
waste
of
time,
and
they
might
just
as
well
hear
it.
the
thing
the
commission
wants
to
avoid
is
--
is
giving
complaints
out
weeks
or
months
in
advance,
so
that
the
complainants
can
frankly
be
--
this
subject
to
--
to
actions
in
between
the
time
of
their
filing
of
their
complaint
and
their
being
called.
and
if
your
honors,
will
turn
to
page
1
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
your
honor,
it
--
it
doesn't
come
out
quite
that
--
just
to
go
back
to
alabama
now,
to
get
away
from
the
complaints
in
this
case.
what
happens
--
the
witness
doesn't
come
in
and
make
a
criminal
charge
as
--
as
a
complaining
witness
before
a
magistrate.
he
comes
in
and
says
“i
have
an
a.b.
degree
from
the
college
of
the
city
of
new
york,
and
i'm
a
bachelor
of
divinity
from
some
other
college
and
i
voted
in
arkansas
and
i
voted
in
california.
and
i
tried
to
register
to
vote
here
and
they
said
that
i
didn't
fill
out
the
--
the
form
properly
or
that
i
misspelled
the
word
and
therefore,
i
was
illiterate.”
now,
that's
his
testimony.
he's
not
saying
that
this
is
willful.
this
is
intentional.
he
leaves
the
facts
to
speak
as
to
whether
it's
arbitrary
and
--
and
maladministration.
but
those
witnesses
have
not
been
treated
by
the
commission
as
defamatory.
if
any
of
the
registrars
so
felt
and
asked
that
they'd
be
called
on
executive
session,
they
would
be
--
it
would
be
so
done.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well,
where
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
where
you
get
into
a
situation
where
one
witness
of
his
own
knowledge
testifies
to
desperate
treatment
between
a
negro
and
a
white
person,
where
the
white
person
is
--
is
not
tested
as
to
literacy
in
exactly
the
same
fashion.
that
comes
a
little
closer
or
where
the
registrar
has
been
offensive
in
the
language
which
he
has
used
or
has
indicated
that
he
is
not
going
to
register
negro
persons
or
to
go
away
and
get
lost
or
something
like
that.
that
i
would
say
comes
closer
to
defamation
and
it
does
reach
defamation.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
they
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
they
are
only
--
they
only
put
on
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well,
they
are
--
they
only
develop
in
--
in
public
hearing,
the
situations
where
they
are
--
where
there
are
alleged
violations.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
well,
is
it
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
exact
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
--
that
says
what
i've
been
trying
to
say
for
an
hour
here
and
i'm
--
haven't
done
very
well.
the
--
the
fact
to
the
matter
here
is
that
no
one
is
singling
out
a
registrar
as
a
criminal.
everyone's
approaching
this
as
the
registrars
are
performing
a
state
function,
in
accordance
with
their
state
policy,
as
they
understand
it
and
has
it
has
been
explained
to
them.
the
statute
itself
sets
up
a
subjective
test
whereby
a
witness
is
--
is
asked
about
what
any
section
from
the
federal
or
state
constitution
means.
and
the
registrar
is
told
how
to
apply
that
test.
and
the
registrar
is
told
how
to
handle
misspellings
and
applications,
and
how
they
should
not
help
negroes
fill
applications
up.
that's
told
to
them
not
by
stray
individuals,
but
by
the
chairman
and
the
counsel
of
a
joint
legislative
committee,
which
was
set
up
for
that
purpose.
to
oversee
the
perpetuation
of
segregation
and
to
see
that
these
things
were
understood
by
the
registrars
on
the
theory
that
a
rigid
enforcement
of
this
law
would
automatically
cutdown
negro
registration.
so,
i
think
that
the
whole
picture
becomes
distorted
when
we
look
at
these
registrars
as
defendants.
and
your
honors,
if
i've
taken
the
liberty
as
i
said
of
lodging
the
commission's
report
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
there
are
two
chapters,
one
on
alabama,
which
is
chapter
5
and
one
on
louisiana,
chapter
98,
and
the
findings
of
the
commission
at
--
at
134.
now,
it
shows
the
--
in
retrospect,
what
the
commission
has
done.
if
there
are
three
registrars
mentioned
by
name,
i'm
--
i
--
i
don't
remember
the
third
part.
i
think,
there
are
two
in
alabama
who
got
wrangle
over
their
records
and
they're
mentioned
by
name.
but
in
130
odd
pages,
on
voting,
i
don't
think
there
be
found
130
lines
which
can
be
called
in
anyway,
accusatory.
and
the
accusations
are
not
left
to
southern
states.
new
york
has
singled
out
for
the
failure
to
handle
a
puerto
rican
problem,
many
of
people
who
don't
speak
english.
and
the
department
of
justice
incidentally
has
mentioned
at
times,
not
too
favorably.
so
there's
a
--
is
a
sweeping
survey
in
130
pages
and
there's
no
time
taken
to
get
lost
in
whether
or
not
a
registrar
did
what
he
or
she
did
dishonestly,
stupidly,
arbitrarily,
or
--
or
what
the
reason
for
it
was.
all
he
did
is
to
get
the
picture
of
--
of
negroes
trying
to
register
and
what
they're
confronted
with
as
they
do
so.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
in
a
--
in
so
many
words,
it
does
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
as
to
voting
only
--
only
one.
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
number
held
on
housing
and
education.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
--
i
don't
think
--
i
think
there
was
--
there
was
a
hearing
on
voting
in
--
in
new
york.
i
think
there
were
two
on
voting,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
private
hearings,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
i
don't
know
of
any.
i
think
they
just
private
interviews
and
there've
been
no
involuntary
private
hearings.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no.
and
not
must
he
asked
to
be
and
i
don't
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
it
does
not,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
did
--
i'm
--
i
can
see
no
objection
to
that
and
i
felt
that
the
commission
would
have
any,
from
it
they've
said
that,
but
actually,
the
rule
does
not
so
provide.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
he
is,
in
the
expressed
terms
of
the
rule
and
the
statute.
he's
entitled
--
he's
--
he's
entitled
to
ask
the
commission
to
subpoena
witnesses
for
him.
the
commission
has
the
discretions
as
to
whether
it
will
or
will
not.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
--
if
your
honor,
will
turn
to
page
16,
section
102
subdivision
(e)
and
then
sub-subdivision
(3),
it
just
says,
“the
commission
shall
receive
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
at
page
60
of
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
says,
“that
the
commission
determines
that
the
evidence
will
tend
to
defame
and
so
forth
and
after
the
executive
hearing,
it
shall
afford
such
person
an
opportunity
(inaudible)
voluntarily
to
appear
as
a
witness
and
receive
and
dispose
a
request
from
such
person
to
subpoena
additional
witnesses.”
and
then
in
the
rules
of
the
--
of
the
commission
--
the
rules
on
page
58
expressly
provide
for
the
taking
of
transcripts
in
all
hearings,
that's
subdivision
(f),
and
then
in
subdivision
(j),
it
deals
with
the
question
of
defamatory
testimony.
but
it
does
not
go
beyond
the
statute
in
--
in
establishing
the
standard
as
to
the
subpoenas.
your
honor,
i
think
that's
all
i
have
to
say
on
the
question
of
apprisal.
i
don't
want
to
labor
legislative
history
again,
but
that
was
all
fought
out
in
the
congress,
the
dies
amendments
provided,
in
expressed
terms,
maybe
seen
in
the
--
in
the
next
to
the
last
page
of
our
main
brief,
“that
insofar
as
practical,
any
person
whose
activities
are
the
subject
of
investigation
by
the
commission
or
about
whom
adverse
information
is
proposed
to
be
presented
at
a
public
hearing
of
the
commission,
shall
be
fully
advised
by
the
commission
as
to
the
matters
into
which
the
commission
proposes
to
inquire
and
the
adverse
material
which
is
proposed
to
be
presented
and
insofar
as
practical,
these
materials
to
be
given
to
them,
that
the
dies
amendment
expressly
provided.”
that
was
in
the
dirksen
bill.
that
was
the
bill
that
did
not
pass.
and
when
the
house
bill
came
over
to
the
senate,
senator
talmadge
and
senator
stennis,
both
protested
with
eloquence,
about
the
deletion
of
this
section.
so,
again,
i
say
that
the
commission
has,
in
its
rules,
really
gone
beyond
anything
that
congress
intended
to
require
of
it,
as
far
as
apprisal
is
concerned.
oh,
in
the
letter
i
meant
to
--
to
read
on
page
148
of
the
record,
to
show
what
it
is
that
the
commission
appears
and
the
reason
for
its
policy,
i
think
is
illustrative.
this
is
a
letter
from
mr.
shaw,
who
represents
the
plaintiffs
in
the
slawson
case,
and
also
at
that
time,
one
of
the
individual
registrars.
we
are
writing
on
behalf
of
ms.
lannie
linton,
registrar
of
voters,
claiborne
parish,
louisiana.
at
a
meeting
in
minden,
louisiana,
held
on
march
12th,
1959,
colonel
a.
m.
rosenfeld,
chief
of
the
complaints
division
of
your
commission,
stated
that
there
was
on
file
with
your
commission
four
sworn
statements,
charging
the
registrar
with
depriving
citizens
of
claiborne
parish,
of
their
voting
privilege
by
reason
of
color,
race,
religion,
or
national
origin.
my
client
knows
these
sworn
allegations
to
be
false,
since
no
such
discrimination
has
been
practiced.
accordingly,
she
wishes
to
prefer
charges
of
perjury
against
the
person
or
parties
responsible
for
these
misrepresentations.
louisiana
revised
statutes,
title
14
section
123,
designate
such
misrepresentations
of
perjury,
felony
under
the
laws
of
louisiana.
your
attention
is
also
invited.
to
louisiana
revised
statutes
title
14,
section
25,
which
defines
accessory
after
the
fact,
as
being
any
person
who
aids
a
felon
with
the
intent
that
he
may
escape
arrest,
trial,
conviction
or
punishment.
an
accessory
after
the
fact
is
also
guilty
of
the
felony.
we
herewith
warmly
demand
that
you
forward
to
us
copies
of
the
affidavits
referred
to
in
order
that
a
proper
presentment
maybe
made
to
the
grand
jury.
colonel
rosenfeld
also
advised
that
agents
from
the
commission
had
investigated
each
of
the
affidavits
by
personal
visit
the
affiants
here
in
louisiana.
this
means
that
the
crime
has
been
completed
in
louisiana.
i
need
not
remind
you
that
proceedings
before
a
grand
jury
are
secret
and
no
affiant
need
fair
reprisals,
if
he
can
establish
his
innocence
for
the
satisfaction
of
such
grand
jury.
we
shall
await
your
reply
and
copies
of
the
accusations.
on
receiving
that
letter,
the
commission
reaffirmed
its
policy
of
maintaining
secrecy
as
to
its
complaints
until
the
actual
holding
of
the
executive
session.
and
that
is
the
fear
of
such
retaliation
against
these
complainants
in
advance
to
the
hearing.
after
the
hearing,
they'll
take
the
chances,
but
to
have
it
happen
in
advance
of
the
hearing
is
the
thing
that
commission
feared.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
no
right
of
independent
cross-examination.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
the
--
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
dies
amendment
which
was
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
this
is
not
the
law.
this
is
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
--
this
is
what
--
what
the
senate
tried
to
get
into
the
law
and
just
didn't
get
in.
mr.
lawrence
e.
walsh
didn't
go.
thank
you
very
much.
