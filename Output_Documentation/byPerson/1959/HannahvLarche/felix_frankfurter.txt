justice

does
the
--
does
defamation
enter
into
the
case
because
there
maybe
undisclosed
complaints
against
them
of
a
defamatory
character,
which
they
cannot
meet
because
no
disclosure
is
made
of
those
withheld
documents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that's
the
basis
of
their
defamation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
can't
consider
this
case
or
can
we
that
all
possibility
of
whatever
scienter
or
willfullness
is
required
under
theirs
to
the
right
statute
is
to
be
excluded
from
consideration.
but
none
of
this
may
--
no
--
no
withholding
of
the
right
or
the
opportunity,
the
right
about
--
otherwise
qualify
negro
citizens
to
vote
is
to
preclude
the
assumption
there
might
be
some
willfulness
about
it.
is
that
to
be
excluded
from
all
considerations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
commissioner
was
doing,
i'm
just
asking
that.
i'm
only
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
these
--
these
specific
instances
but
in
the
whole
domain
they're
requiring,
they
don't
exclude
willfulness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
no
--
no.
it's
all
clear
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
walsh,
you've
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
indicate
that.
but
would
you
mind
read
--
summarizing
precisely
what
the
situation
under
the
statute
and
the
implementing
rules
is
regarding
the
resort
to
secret
--
to
executive
session,
with
--
as
to
the
complainant,
the
kind
of
witnesses
and
the
complainant
in
this
case
were?
the
officials
and
non-officials
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
makes
any
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
the
complainants
in
these
suits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
--
what
is
the
situation
as
to
them
in
regard
to
the
utilization
of
executive
session
as
to
these
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
what
was
done
or
were
supposed
to
be
done
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
commission
could
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
i
understand
beside
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
does
a
--
does
a
potentially
defaming
witness,
have
to
say,
“i'm
going
to
defame
some
people?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
does
this
come
into
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
the
registrar
--
so
far
as
a
registrar
is
concerned,
he
may
make
accusation
against
people,
which
i've
come
to
him
to
here,
say
out
of
the
public
burdens
and
what
--
and
whatever
he
testifies
will
always
be
in
public,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
real
complaint,
if
i
may
clearly
pursue
that
--
that
real
complaint
is
that
these
plaintiffs,
they're
not
--
never
restricted
in
having
full
publicity
for
whatever
they
have
to
say.
they
--
their
complaint
is
that
the
protection
of
defamation
not
established,
it
feels
so
far
as
the
public
is
concerned,
because
they
have
an
access
to
it,
is
that
right?
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
secret
--
there's
a
complaint
and
then
they
made
the
commission
--
the
commission
has
heard
them
towards
investigated
or
whatever
the
name
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
so
all
this
is
in
--
the
reason
for
it
is
to
protect
publicity
of
charges
that
has
not
been
established.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
for
nondisclosure
is
to
protect
against
charges
by
the
people
who
make
defamatory
or
invidious
charges,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
--
did
i
correctly
hear
or
taken,
you
said
the
registrar
maybe
present
while
defamatory
charges
were
made
against
him
in
executive
session.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
--
could
not
in
the
rules,
but
that
is
the
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
what,
academic
in
what
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
you
said
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
could
be
present,
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
their
confrontation
except
through
examination,
is
it
--
it's
not
in
the
rules,
it
--
it
is
stated
in
the
record,
are
you
in
a
position
to
state
that
is
a
fixed
practice
of
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
that's
why,
i
put
alternative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
fixed
practice
of
theirs
that
you
authorized
the
state
here,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
has
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
that's
a
basis
on
which
they
proceed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
the
basis
on
which
they
operate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
in
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
their
own
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
their
own
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
words,
if
i
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
your
word,
“pattern,”
should
light
on
it.
if
there's
a
pattern
of
not
voting
with
the
ratio
of
white
to
colored
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
that
pattern,
deductions
may
be
made,
which
involves
no
--
no
charge
against
the
particular
person
or
any
--
overt
misconduct
of
a
particular
person,
accepting
so
far
to
this
part
of
the
pattern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
entirely,
as
in
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
they
couldn't
make
rules
in
addition
to
what
congress
had
written
out,
which
would
do
the
very
thing
which
you
complained
of
voluntary
as
supposed
by
rules.
suppose
the
commission
has
promulgated
rules
in
terms
to
do
what
you
think
should
be
done.
would
you
think
that
offered
(voice

--
justice
felix

(voice

of
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
would
that
be
ultra
vires
if
then,
they
were
issued
such
rules?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
i'm
asking
you
whether
they
would
have
--
it
would
have
been
beyond
their
power
to
issue
such
rules
as
would
satisfy
your
present
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
they
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
thing
would
added
to
--
but
they
would
be
adding
to
what
congress
had
written.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you're
not
arguing
or
cannot
argue,
i
take
it
that,
they
couldn't
issue
any
additional
ruling,
rules
in
addition
to
what
congress
had
spelled
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
substantive
things,
such
as
you
want
in
this
case.
they
--
you
agreed
a
minute
ago,
that
only
goes
there.
but
you
said
they
could
issue
rules
to
satisfy
the
claims
you're
making
here
for
the
absence
of
these
claims.

mr.
shaw,
the
availability

accessibility
to
record,
registrar

in
louisiana
either
by
the
commission
or
anybody
acting
before
them
or
the

own,
has
that
gone
into
litigation?
is
that
given
rise
to
litigation?
justice

it's
not
in
this
litigation,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
no
--
the
judgment

the
complaint
of
the
plaintiffs
here
do
not
raise
any
question
of
the

finding
counterclaims.

to
the

of

isn't
it?

i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
have
encounter
or
not,
what
i
want
to
know
if
it's
in
litigation?
justice
felix

what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
that
refusal

that
advice
of
the
attorney
general
had
been
made
the
basis
of
an
action
by
any
agency

that

justice

i
say
that
was
in
effect
joint

just
fabrication.
justice
felix

you
--
you
agree
with
the
government
that
this
--
the
court
should
be
against
you
on
the
ultra
vires
of
the
rules
promulgated
by
the

therefore,
when
reaches

therefore,
when
it's
up
to
--
up
again
that
--
in
which
way
you
look
at
it,
up
to
the
constitutional
issues
that
this
is
the
place
to
decide
it
and
not
to
set
aside.
justice

(voice

--
on
that.
justice
felix

but
i
thought
they'd
already
decided
that
the
statute
is
constitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
that
issue.
what
do
you
say
to
this
--
judge
--
judge

that
--
of
course
this
court
has
done
both
things

justice

if
ever
that
in
deciding
whether
the
constitutional
question
is
not
yet
canvassed
by
the
lower
court,
it
should
be
dealt
with
here,
it
is
appropriate
to
take
into
account
the
length
of
life
that
this
isn't
the
remaining

of
