was
that
done
by
an
amendment,
a
separate
amendment
or
that
part
of
the
revision
for
these
statements
of
penal
code.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
wouldn't
that
make
a
difference?
well,
this
is
just
a
formalization,
great
many
of
those
things
in
the
--
in
title
18,
numerous
instances
where
in
the
old
ways,
the
golf
club
appeared
in
one
paragraph
and
then
as
a
matter
of
more
fastidious
form
they're
broken
out
into
a,
b,
c,
or
one,
two,
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that's
your
argument
but
i
also
understand
you
to
say
that
if
it
appeared
and
i'm
suggesting
that
it
appeared
a
separate
paragraph,
one
two
three
or
a,
b,
c
that
would
be
different
because
that
would
indicate
that
it
isn't
just
one
what
you
call
act,
because
i
think
it,
if
i
may
say
so,
covered
up
a
lot
of
implications
with
such
one
act,
that's
the
whole
problem
(inaudible).
the
fact
of
it
that
once
that
a
(inaudible)
produce
the
result
having
means
one
act
in
the
point
within
the
law,
a
single
--
a
single
discharge
of
--
of
high
hand
may
produce
two
very
separate
results
legally
speaking
punishable
by
two
separate
results.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
i
sought
the
united
states
marshall
in
new
york,
i
made
it
in
the
committee
two
legally
set
legally
responsible
and
punishable
consequences,
namely,
assault
ordinary
assault
and
interfering
with
the
--
with
the
business
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
where
the
exchange
we
have
with
justice
brennan,
and
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
they're
not
separated
in
a
single
paragraph
as
a
matter
of
english
by
semicolons
or
commas
but
they're
separated
by
having
a,
b,
c
or
one,
two,
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
shouldn't
--
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
gore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
legislative
history
shows
not
a
sentiment
but
a
severity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
to
prevent
anything
in
the
constitution
to
prevent
congress
from
dealing
with
only
one
aspect
in
narcotics
violation
just
as
one
aspect
in
offenses
but
if
there
are
some
comment
in
the
grievance
in
fold
of
peer
sentence
with
anything
of
the
constitution
prevents
them
from
doing
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
to
say
in
result
by
just
having
one
--
one
act
but
saying
if
that
act
(inaudible)
the
circumstances
we
are
talking
about,
that
shall
be
almost
a
life
time
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
emphasis
is
also
was
on
the
fact
of
transportation
and
not
on
the
fact
of
prostitution.
to
be
sure
to
have
transportations
of
prostitutes
but
the
emphasis
was
on
the
carriage
and
there
is
only
one
carriage,
there
were
x
number
of
prostitutes
but
only
one
carriage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
might
be
a
good
reason
for
overruling
bell,
but
that
doesn't
--
that
we
go
--
jump
to
the
fact
when
congress
defined
four
different
offenses,
not
one
offense,
four
different
offenses
that
is
only
one
offense.
it
might
overrule
bell
because
that
seems
to
be
too
lenient
of
a
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
in
all
the
earlier
and
by
earlier
i
mean
until
very
relatively
recently,
congress
use
to
just
put
in
one
paragraph
a
number
of
offenses.
i'm
not
talking
about
narcotics.
you
go
to
their
volume
and
find
big
chunks
of
paragraphs
and
great
of
fastidiousness
in
ordering
or
inform
is
a
relatively
recent
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
more
artistic,
i
think
from
its
logic
--
it's
more
artistic
and
easier
for
the
--
for
the
lawyers
who
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
this
broken
up
into
subsection
or
whatever
you
call
it?
was
it
the
1940
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
1939
act.
that
is
when
they
--
when
there
was
a
formal
merely
allegedly
formal
revision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
penal
code,
the
old
penal
code
of
1911
and
that
after
1911
there
were
accretion
and
then
in
1939
they
just
made
a

justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
understand.
i
beg
your
pardon.
