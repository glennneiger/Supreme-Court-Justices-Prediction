mr.
john
l.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
approaching
the
formal
part
of
my
argument
perhaps
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
on
the
petitioner's
argument
and
the
first
one,
i
think
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
brennan
yesterday,
as
to
whether
a
person
could
be
convicted
under
this
statute
of
four
separate
offenses.
i
think
that
he
could
be,
if
there
were
separate
evidence
of
each
of
the
activities
proscribed
by
the
statute.
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
either
in
law
or
logic
why
that
could
not
be
so?
and
so
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
it
was
entirely
proper
for
the
petitioner
to
be
charged
and
convicted
and
successively
punished
for
separate
and
distinct
violations
of
this
particular
statute,
which
prohibits
purchase
as
well
as
sale,
i
might
say
two
diametrically
opposed
activities.
whatever
maybe
said
concerning
the
ambiguity
that
might
exist
with
respect
to
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute
dispensing
and
distribution
and
sale,
there
is
certainly
no
occasion
to
confuse
purchase
with
sale.
they
are
two
distinct
acts,
opposite
acts,
each
having
its
own
participants,
its
own
objectives.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
believe
it
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
of
course,
this
case
comes
up
on
a
motion
under
28
u.s.c.
2255.
it
was
not
deemed
necessary
to
print
the
record
since
counsel
had
made
the
conception
as
he
does
at
page
7
of
his
brief.
that
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
only
evidence
adduced
at
the
trial
was
the
sale
alleged
in
count
4,
and
that
his
conviction
on
count
3
alleging
a
purchase
was
based
on
the
statutory
presumption
arising
from
the
fact
of
his
possession.
so
there
is,
as
we
say,
distinct
evidence
proved
the
purchase
stemming
from
the
presumption
arising
out
of
proof
of
possession.
there
is
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
would
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
statute
provides
that
possession
shall
be
presumpt
--
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
violation.
whether
or
not
that
could
stand
for
a
sale
violation
is
a
question
which
of
course,
is
not
in
this
case.
my
own
opinion
would
be
that
it
would
be
quite
illogical
to
use
the
presumption
to
stand
in
place
of
proof
of
sale,
direct
proof
of
sale
because
i
think
that
possession
if
it
infers
anything
it
infers
that
you
have
not
sold.
perhaps
in
a
case
where
--
where
the
sale
was
made
without
possession,
it
could
possibly
be
sold,
but
in
any
event
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
think
as
long
as
we
don't
use
the
presumption
more
than
once,
and
i
would
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
presumption
i
specify
as
enumerated
in
the
statute
that
the
presumption
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
violation.
so
that
i
would
not
contend
that
the
presumption
could
be
used
successively,
a
single
possession
could
not
be
used
successively
as
proof
of
a
purchase
and
of
the
sale
dispensing
and
distribution.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
the
presumption
is
exhausted
once
it
has
stood
for
proof
of
one
of
the
elements
of
the
event.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
statute
says
and
we
have
quoted
it
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
says
prima
facie
proof
of
a
violation,
i
think
that
it
would
be
exhausted
when
it
had
been
utilized
to
prove
a
violation.
at
least
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
it
would
depend
--
i
think
they
are
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
i
think
that
you
can
only
use
the
possession
there
to
prove
one
act
of
purchase
because
it's
all
the
same
narcotics.
however,
there
are
separate
acts
of
sale
and
each
of
those
would
be
a
separate
offense
as
blockburger
said.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
here,
there
was
only
one
sale
and
one
--
one
bulk
narcotics.
it
consisted
of
two
ounces
of
heroine
and
they
were
just
in
a
single
possession
and
it
was
not
split.
so
factually,
we
don't
have
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
we,
as
i've
indicated,
we
would
take
the
position,
i
believe
that
the
presumption
would
be
exhausted
when
you
had
utilized
it
to
prove
a
single
offense
and
the
--
the
presumption
arises
from
possession
of
the
drug.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
sales
again
in
the
example
you've
given
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
where
the
sales
arise
out
of
one
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
bulk
narcotics
split
into
three
portions
and
sold
separately.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
think
that
if
the
--
in
that
event,
if
the
petitioner,
the
defendant
came
forward
with
proof
that
the
sales
were
each
made
from
a
single
bulk
of
narcotics
possessed
by
him,
i
think
that
we
would
have
to
agree
that
only
one
offense
could
be
predicated
upon
his
possession
of
that
narcotics.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
do
--
i
do
your
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
not
from
a
single
act
of
possession.
i
don't
think
it's
consistent
with
that
interpretation,
but
i
don't
think
that
you
can
jump
from
that
point
and
say
that
congress
intended
to
lump
all
of
these
activities
together
and
intended
only
a
single
offense
to
be
created
by
the
language
used.
certainly,
they
used
inept
language
to
--
to
define
a
single
offense
when
they
said
purchase,
sale,
dispense,
and
distribute.
in
fact,
i
believe
it
was
in
the
nigro
case
that
that
contention
was
raised
and
this
court
said,
“it
would
seem
to
be
admissible
and
wise
in
a
law
seeking
to
impose
taxes
for
the
sale
of
an
illusive
subject
to
require
conformity
to
a
prescribed
method
of
sale
and
delivery
calculated
to
disclose
or
make
more
difficult
any
escape
from
the
tax.
if
this
maybe
done,
any
departure
from
the
steps
enjoined
maybe
punished
and
added
penalties
maybe
fixed
for
successive
omissions.
so,
i
believe
that
the
contention
raised
by
petitioner
that
that
these
activities
were
all
intended
by
congress
only
to
proscribe
a
single
offense
is
--
is
disposed
off
in
the
nigro
case
and
also,
in
the
blockburger
case,
we
had
successive
sales
on
succeeding
days,
very
closely
associated
sales.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
order
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
but
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
they
were
but
the
order
for
the
second
sale
was
taken
at
the
time
of
the
first
sale.
they
were
that
closely
related.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
correct.
now,
counsel
says
that
each
of
the
cases
coming
before
this
court
have
involved
separate
and
distinct
statutes.
that
is
not
so.
in
both
the
albrecht
case
which
punished
possession
of
liquor
and
sale
of
the
same
liquor
which
had
been
possessed,
both
of
those
offenses
were
laid
under
the
national
prohibition
act.
in
the
case
of
burton
agreeing
to
receive
compensation
and
receipt
of
compensation
again
involved
only
a
single
statute
with
separate
provisions.
now,
the
question
has
been
raised
as
to
whether
the
statute
has
been
broken
down
since
its
original
enactment.
this
statute
was
originally
enacted
as
part
of
the
revenue
act
of
1918,
it
became
effective
in
1919.
it
was
an
amendment
to
the
harrison
narcotic
act
which
had
been
enacted
in
1914.
the
harrison
narcotic
act
as
blockburger
points
out,
had
its
separate
penalty
section
and
this
was
--
this
format
was
continued
through
the
reenactment
of
the
statute
which
i
suggest
to
the
court
was
intended
to
affect
--
each
reenactment
was
intended
to
affect
no
substantive
change
than
the
effect
of
the
statute.
in
blockburger,
the
petitioner
contended
that
the
all
inclusive
penal
section
of
that
act
“any
person
who
violates
or
fails
to
comply
with
any
of
the
requirements
of
this
act”
is
to
be
construed
as
imposing
a
single
punishment
for
the
distinct
requirements
of
the
separate
provisions
of
the
act.
the
court
said,
“the
plain
meaning
of
the
provision
is
that
each
offense
is
subject
to
the
penalty
proscribed
and
if
that
be
too
harsh,
the
remedy
must
be
afforded
by
act
of
congress.”
the
separate
penalty
provision
was
continued
in
section
2557
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
it's
now
contained
in
an
enlarged
form,
elaborate
form,
in
section
7237
under
the
1954
act,
which
of
course,
under
our
modern
device
of
--
of
enacting
legislation,
of
separating
the
substantive
offenses
in
one
section
of
the
act,
the
penalty
section
and
in
another
is
wholly
consistent,
but
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
interpreted
as
intending
to
impose
only
a
single
punishment
for
all
violations
committed.
blockburger
disposed
to
that
contention
long
ago.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
there
are
two
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
there
are
two
sections
dealing
with
sale.
perhaps
if
i
get
in
to
my
formal
argument,
it
would
become
clearer.
this
statute,
2553
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
provides
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
purchase,
sell,
dispense,
or
distribute
narcotic
drugs
except
in
or
from
the
original
stamped
package.
and
further
that
the
absence
of
appropriate
tax
paid
stamps
from
the
drug
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
violation
of
this
subsection
by
the
person
in
whose
possession
they
are
found.
now,
we
have
discussed
at
some
length
whether
the
statute
proscribes
several
different
activities
and
we
have
also
seen
that
the
statute
contains
this
presumption
based
upon
possession
from
proof
of
which
the
element,
the
statutory
element
as
distinguished
from
the
evidence
to
prove
that
element
maybe
inferred.
now,
the
case
comes
up
on
2255
motion
and
i
will
not
belabor
with
the
court
with
the
intimate
history
of
the
case.
suffice
it
to
say,
i
think,
that
we
have
here
a
legal
question
as
to
whether
under
this
statute
separate
offenses
of
purchase
and
sale
are
defined
by
this
enactment.
now,
the
question
of
identity
of
offenses
may
arise
in
different
circumstances.
first,
there
is
the
situation
where
the
defendant's
conduct
allegedly
violates
several
statutes.
and
an
example
of
this
is
the
blockburger
case
where
a
sale
was
held
violative
of
2553
(a),
the
present
statute
and
2554
(a)
which
is
selling
without
a
written
order
form.
king
against
united
states
in
280
u.s.
affirming
31
f.2d
at
page
17
under
authority
of
albrecht
held
that
selling
morphine
not
in
or
from
this
original
stamp
package
and
shipping
the
same
morphine
in
interstate
commerce
were
different
offenses
and
i
might
note
there
that
it
was
held
in
a
case
which
involved
successive
trials.
pinkerton
against
united
states
of
course
held
that
conspiracy
and
the
substant
--
substantive
offense
which
is
the
objective
of
the
conspiracy
are
separate
and
distinct
offenses.
gavieres
was
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
disorderly
conduct
and
insulting
a
public
official,
both
offenses
arising
out
of
the
single
course
of
conduct.
more
recently,
we
of
course
have
had
the
gore
case
which
i
will
deal
with
a
little
bit
more
at
length,
and
lastly,
harris.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
undoubtedly
under
gore,
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
violating
section
174
of
title
21.
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
the
export-import
act.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
receiving
and
buying
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
selling,
receiving
and
concealing
narcotics
knowing
them
to
have
been
unlawfully
imported.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
he
was
also
guilty
of
this
statute
and
he
was
also
guilty
of
section
40
--
what
is
now
4705
(a)
selling
narcotic
drugs
not
in
pursuance
to
a
written
order
form.
so,
those
would
be
three
offenses.
we
would
have
--
if
--
if
we
use
the
presumption
on
the
other
two
offenses
on
174
and
4705,
i
don't
think
that
would
exhaust
the
presumption
under
4704,
because
each
of
the
statutes,
well,
there
is
no
presumption
under
4705,
i'm
sorry.
but
if
we
--
we
could
have
use
the
presumption
under
174
of
title
21
as
we
did
in
harris
and
used
it
also
under
4704
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
to
prove
the
purchase.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
if
we
had
separate
and
distinct
evidence
of
sale
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
think
that
would
be
four
--
there
would
be
four
counts
for
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
one
stemming
from
purchase
under
174,
one
stemming
from
purchase
under
4704,
one
stemming
from
sale
under
4704
and
second
stemming
from
sale
under
4705.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i'm
sorry
that
i'm
using
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
current
statutory
references,
i'm
more
familiar
with
them.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
we
have
used
them
under
4704
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
wouldn't
know
of
that.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
would
in
no
event
attempt
to
support
four
charges
under
the
present
statute
based
upon
a
single
sale.
i
wish
to
make
that
clear.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
because
you
have
exhausted
--
you
have
exhausted
the
statute
when
you
have
proved
by
a
single
act
of
sale
that
he
violated
the
single
provision
of
selling,
not
either
from
the
original
stamp
package.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
concede
that
that
those
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
dispensing
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
dispensing
probably
incorporates
and
emerges
with
sale
in
that
particular
circumstance.
you
either
have
to
charge
him
with
dispensing
or
with
selling.
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
there
is
certainly,
as
i've
said
before,
room
for
ambiguity
as
between
those
two
offenses
and
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
defendant
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
distribution
is
also
analogous
to
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
selling
and
distri
--
and
dispensing.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
either
purchase
and
sale
or
purchase
and
dispense
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
and
purchase
and
distribution.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
conceded
that
on
the
argument
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
on
the
gore
case.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
but
then
we
had
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
think
you
could
add
a
charge
under
the
export-import
act
of
receiving
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
narcotic
drugs
knowing
them
to
have
been
unlawfully
imported.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
and
i
think
you
could
add
the
offense
under
the
written
order
form
provision
selling
without
a
written
order
form.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
we
would
be
relying
--
well
possibly,
possibly
you
could
do
the
same
thing
under
174.
section
174
prohibits
both
buying
and
selling.
now,
you
could
duplicate
under
that
statute
what
we
have
done
here.
utilize
the
presumption
provision
in
that
--
in
that
section
to
prove
the
buying
and
use
your
direct
and
affirmative
evidence
of
sale
to
prove
the
sale.
so,
you
might
have
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
two
offenses
under
that
statute.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
think
with
respect
to
the
last
question
that
you've
asked
as
to
whether
it
could
be
35
or
70,
if
a
man
has
been
convicted
of
a
number
of
different
offenses
occurring
at
the
same
time,
that
is
one
conviction
for
the
purpose
or
the
sentencing
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
specific
fact
situation
came
to
mind
among
the
members
who
--
who
were
on
the
committee.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
don't
know.
all
--
all
i
can
say,
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
congress
intended
to
lay
it
on
a
narcotics
violator
and
my
--
my
personal
acquaintance
with
what
went
on
during
the
amendment
--
the
reenactment
of
the
internal
revenue
code
in
1954
enables
me
to
recall
only
that
each
of
the
members
were
--
was
very
earnest
in
his
desire
that
the
minimum
punishment
be
as
heavy
as
possible.
they
were
not
concerned
about
the
maximum
at
all
and
whether
they
contemplated
that
a
fact
situation
such
as
you
have
described
was
in
their
minds,
i
really
can't
say.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
our
candid
opinion
mr.
chief
justice,
shocking
as
it
maybe
is
that
i
don't
think
that
congress
would
have
been
at
all
shocked.
there
--
they
had
heard
very
lewd
testimony
from
addicts.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
oh
definitely.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
similar
to
this
one
or
similar
to
the
one
which
is
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no.
in
fact
this
--
this
case
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
at
the
present
time,
the
maximum
for
first
offense
is
20
years,
for
second
offense,
40
years.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
this
--
this
man
got
five
in
each
--
at
the
time
that
this
man
committed
his
offense,
the
maximum
was
10
years.
i'm
sorry,
it
was
five
that
he
gave
and
the
maximum
was
two
to
five
for
the
first
offense.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
and
made
also
for
life
sentence
for
dealing
with
heroine
in
the
case
of
the
juvenile,
such
things
as
that
all
combined
to
--
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
deal
mostly
severely
with
narcotic
violators.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
would
not
think
so,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
think
that
when
they
use
language,
i
would
--
i
would
such
as
they
have
here,
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
room
for
ambiguity.
there's
no
equivocation
in
the
language
that
they
use.
i
would
call
attention
to
the
court
of
the
statutes
in
which
congress
has
found
no
difficulty
in
describing
a
single
offense
stemming
from
various
acts,
the
mail
fraud
statute
for
example.
whoever
having
devised
or
intending
to
device
any
scheme
or
manifest
to
the
fraud
or
for
obtaining
money
or
property
by
means
of
false
or
fraudulent
pretenses,
representations
or
promises.
they
use
--
they
can
use
words
very
aptly
to
describe
what
they
mean
and
they
--
they
usually
use
the
words
by
means
of
when
they
are
intending
to
proscribe
a
certain
form
of
conduct
and
then
they
enumerate
the
various
means
by
which
this
conduct
can
be
carried
out.
in
that
case,
i
think
that
there's
not
much
doubt
but
the
man
--
the
defendant
commits
more
than
one
act
proscribed
in
the
means
provision
of
the
statute,
that
he
has
been
guilty
of
only
one
offense.
here
we
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
we
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
because
they're
enumerated
in
--
“by
means
of”.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
mr.
murphy
may
i
(inaudible)
as
it
was
identified
in
the
record
where
as
you
suggest
that
at
the
(inaudible)
a
count
of
offence
for
a
sale
by
the
174,
the
(inaudible)
of
a
sale
of
property
might
have
been
a
conviction
for
the
sale
upon
(inaudible)
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
was
precisely
the
--
the
situation
in
gore.
there
was
a
single
sale
and
gore
was
successively
punished
for
selling
in
violation
of
174,
selling
in
violation
of
4704,
and
selling
in
violation
of
4705.
further
than
that
in
harris--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
same
single
sale,
there
were
two
sales
out
of
which
they
made
six
counts
in
--
in
gore,
but
the
crucial
contention
was
that
for
each
of
those
single
sale,
there's
only
one
punishment
could
be
imposed
and
this
court
said,
“no”.
three
successive
punishments
maybe
imposed
under
three
different
statutory
enactments.
now,
further
than
that
in
harris,
we
had
single
fact
of
possession
under
174
and
this
statute
and
two
offenses
were
carved
out
of
that
and
this
court
said
that
that
was
permissible.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
they
were
separate
statutes
in
that
case,
of
course.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
now
whether
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
violates
the
single
statute,
we
may
divide
this
category
up
into
classifications
in
which
the
defendant
engages
in
a
single
transaction
contrary
to
a
single
provision
of
a
statute
and
thereby
achieves
several
evil
results
and
they're
familiar
with
the
ladner
case,
a
single
shot
resulting
in
injury
to
two
federal
officers,
bell
against
united
states,
349
u.s.
simultaneous
transportation
of
more
than
one
woman
across
interstate
lines
for
immoral
purposes.
in
each
of
those
cases,
of
course,
this
court
applied
the
principle
of
lenity
and
concluded
that
there
was
only
one
effect.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
solely
upon
the
basis
of
the
statutory
language.
the
--
the
language
there
was
subject
to
the
interpretation
that
he
committed
only
one
offense.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
right,
simultaneously.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
this
court
said
with
reference
to
this
question,
i
believe
it
was
in
bell
where
congress
has
not
explicitly
stated
what
the
unit
of
offense
will
be,
this
court
will
apply
the
principle
of
lenity.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
think
it
said
transporting
any
woman.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
emphasis
is
that
(inaudible)
mr.
john
l.
murphy
whoever
knowingly
transports
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
any
woman
in
the
world
could
have
purchase.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
was
a
--
a
i
believe
an
example
of
--
of
the
application
of
the
principle
of
lenity
where
congress
has
not
explicitly
and
quite
clearly
defined
what
the
unit
of
offense
will
be.
as
the
gore
case
points
out
there
is
no
occasion
for
the
application
of
that
rule
in
the
narcotics
area.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
we
don't
have
the
bell
situation
there
[attempt
to
laughter].
the
defendant
--
the
next
category,
i
might
point
out,
is
whether
defendant
engaged
in
several
successive
transactions
of
the
same
kind
contrary
to
a
single
statutory
provision.
and
an
example
of
that
is
in
ebeling
against
morgan,
237
u.s.
cutting
six
mail
bags
in
the
course
of
a
single
transaction,
in
re
henry
123
u.s.
mailing
several
letters
in
furtherance
of
the
scheme
to
defraud
and
of
course
blockburger
which
involved
two
successive
sales
on
different
days.
now,
the
next
category
is
whether
defendant
engages
in
a
single
transaction
and
thereby
violates
several
different
provisions
of
a
single
statute
and
the
leading
case
on
that
is
albrecht
which
said
that
possession
of
liquor
and
sale
of
the
same
liquor
all
in
violation
of
the
single
statute
for
two
different
offenses.
burton,
i've
already
mentioned
agreeing
to
receive
compensation
and
receiving
the
same
compensation.
the
next
category
would
be
whether
defendant
engages
in
several
different
acts
and
thereby
violates
several
different
provisions
of
the
same
statute
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
michener
case,
counterfeiting
case
in
331
u.s.
789,
forging
a
plate
adopted
for
counterfeiting
to
be
made
and
in
possession
of
that
plate
where
separate
offenses
held
to
be
so.
i
believe
that
this
case
falls
in
this
last
mentioned
category
where
the
defendant
has
committed
more
than
one
act
in
violation
of
the
single
statute.
now,
we
must
be
careful
to
distinguish
cases
in
which
the
defendant
engages
in
a
course
of
conduct
such
as
in
u.s.
against
universal
cit
corporation
where
the
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
were
interpreted
as
proscribing
a
course
of
conduct.
however,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
court
was
careful
to
find
out
that
different
kinds
or
classifications
of
conduct,
for
instance,
under
payment
would
be
one
offense,
false
record
keeping
would
be
another
offense
even
under
that
case.
another
case,
another
classification
which
we
should
be
careful
to
distinguish
consists
of
the
case
in
which
one
offense
merges
with
another
of
greater
culpability
as
in
the
prince
case,
entering
into
a
bank
with
intent
to
commit
robbery
and
committing
robbery
therein.
and
with
reference
to
that,
i
--
i
would
like
to
make
a
point
that
we
have
no
occasion
to
consider
the
question
of
intent
in
--
in
connection
with
the
narcotic
statutes.
it's
been
held
by
this
court
in
balint
against
united
states
that
these
are
strictly
malum
prohibitum
offense
as
not
involving
willfulness
or
intent.
now,
when
blockburger
came
before
this
court,
in
1931
i
believe
it
was,
there
were
involved
two
facets
of
that
case,
two
sales
on
successive
days,
and
the
second
sale
was
charged
under
the
stamp
provision
and
under
the
written
order
form
provision.
this
court
held
that
with
respect
to
the
successive
sales,
they
constituted
separate
acts,
separate
offenses
because
they
stem
from
separate
impulses.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
the
same
sale
on
the
second
day
constituted
two
offenses
under
different
statutes,
this
court,
of
course,
held
that
they
were.
gore
came
before
the
court
and
involved,
as
i've
indicated,
a
single
sale
in
violation
of
three
separate
statutory
provisions.
this
court
reaffirmed
the
principle
of
blockburger,
said
that
the
legislative
enactment
in
the
narcotics
field
revealed
a
determination
by
congress
to
turn
the
screw
of
the
criminal
machinery
detection,
prosecution,
and
punishment
tighter
and
tighter.
it
distinguished
these
other
cases,
bell,
on
the
basis
that
lenity
was
applied
there
and
there's
no
implication
for
its
application
in
the
narcotics
field.
universal
cit,
the
court
said,
involve
the
course
of
conduct.
prince
dealt
with
a
statute
of
limited
application,
a
unique
statute.
the
court
also
held
that
there
was
no
double
jeopardy
and
indicated
that
to
accept
the
petitioner's
contention
with
respect
to
that
principle
would
involve
the
overruling
of
a
long
line
of
cases
involving
that
question
carter
against
mcglowry,
morgan
against
divine,
albrecht,
pinkerton,
american
tobacco,
u.s.
against
michener,
and
(inaudible).
the
court
finally
said
that
the
issue
was
one
at
phenology
and
not
most
tantalizing
aspect
of
it
the
apportionment
of
proper
punishment.
court
noted
that
this
court
has
no
authority
to
provide
sentences.
harris
came
before
this
court
at
the
previous
term
and
involved
the
single
transaction
violative
--
violative
of
two
separate
statutory
provisions,
section
174
title
21
and
the
present
statute.
the
charges
were
a
purchase
from
an
--
unstamped
package
and
receiving
and
concealed
unlawfully
imported
narcotics.
the
petitioner's
contention
there
was
identical
with
the
contention
in
this
one
in
this
case
that
the
same
evidence
rule
of
the
blockburger
case
required
that
the
court
interpret
defendant's
conduct
as
constituting
only
a
single
offense.
court
said
that
the
violations
as
distinguished
from
the
direct
evidence
offered
to
prove
them
was
distinctly
different
under
each
statute
and
the
court
emphasized
that
it
is
the
element
of
the
statutory
offenses
that
defines
the
crime
and
determines
whether
what
act
will
constitute
more
than
one
offense.
here
of
course,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
room
for
doubt
that
purchase
and
sale
constitute
separate
elements.
as
i've
indicated
before,
the
offenses
here
involved
diametrically
opposed
acts,
each
requiring
its
own
separate
impulse,
enterprise
and
participants.
it's
been
noted
that
we
have
separate
proof
of
the
sale,
so
that
we
did
not
rely
on
the
same
evidence
if
that's
the
--
the
interpretation
of
the
blockburger
rule.
we
certainly
have
different
elements,
and
if
that
is
the
interpretation
and
--
and
i
may
say
that
--
that
blockburger
has
been
bended
about
quite
a
bit.
the
rule
of
blockburger
has
been,
i
think,
stated
only
partially
time
and
time
again.
the
usual
quote
is
as
follows.
the
applicable
rule
is
that
where
the
same
act
or
transaction
constitutes
a
violation
of
two
distinct
statutory
provisions
the
test
to
be
applied
to
determine
whether
there
are
two
offenses
or
only
one
is
whether
each
provision
requires
proof
of
a
fact
which
the
other
does
not.
eliminated
from
that
quote,
is
the
sentence
which
precedes
it,
and
i
will
quote,
“each
of
the
offenses
created
requires
proof
of
a
different
element”.
so,
it
is
even
under
blockburger,
it
is
the
element
of
the
offense
rather
than
the
primary
evidence
necessary
to
prove
those
elements
that's
important.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
proof
of
possession,
standing
in
lieu
of
purchase,
proof
of
sale
which
was
proved
by
direct
affirmative
evidence.
this
case
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
much
stronger
legally
than
harris.
harris
we
relied
solely
upon
a
single
act
of
possession.
here
we
have
separate
evidence
of
sale.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
certainly,
in
that
distinction
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
compelling
because
congress
can
certainly
define
separate
offenses
in
a
single
statute
as
well
as
in
separate
statutes
and
it
has
done
so
in
--
in
many
different
fields.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
tendency
to
break
it
down
into
separate
subsections,
a
typical
example
is
the
internal
revenue
act
of
1954
where
each
section
has
been
broken
down
into
subsections
and
all
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
logic
i
suppose
so
that
you
can
identify
the
conduct
proscribed
readily
without
having
two
rules,
a
long
and
difficult
provision
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
it
certainly
did
that
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
statutes
were
enacted
at
different
times
and
defined
a
various
means
by
which
the
tax
could
be
protected
and
also
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
traffic
in
narcotics
could
be
suppressed.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no.
that
argument
is
certainly
not
available.
however,
the
--
the
argument
is
available
that
--
that
congress
in
separately
enacting
this
statute
and
proscribing
various
activities
which
had
felt
should
be
outlawed
and
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
of
course,
i
agree,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
there's
little
to
be
gained
from
examining
the
legislative
history
in
connection
with
the
question
now
before
the
case
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
before
the
court.
yes.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
was
enacted,
there
is
the
one
paragraph
reference
in
the
report
on
the
revenue
act
of
1918
which
refers
to
this
case
and
simply
says
that
the
statute
is
being
enacted
to
correct
a
loophole
created
by
the
(inaudible)
and
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
think
it
was
the
1939
act.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
this
was
the
revenue
act.
this
was
not
part
of
the
penal
code.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
right.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no.
the
--
the
breakup,
i
think,
that
was
referred
to,
was
that
the
penal
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
section
is
different
--
in
a
different
place
in
the
code
now
than
it
was
originally.
that
should
make
no
difference
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
correct.
finally,
i
should
mention
that
the
petitioner
cites
the
case
of
ballerini
against
aderholt
in
his
brief.
that
case
was
specifically
disapproved
in
the
blockburger
case.
the
other
case
cited
by
petitioner,
donaldson,
involved
the
question
of
venue
and
i
believe
it's
completely
inapplicable
to
the
question
at
issue
here.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
you
mean
the
question
of
--
of
whether
the
presumption
extends
to
venue?
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
no.
it
was
not
raised
below.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
correct.
if
it
had
been
raised,
of
course,
the
casey
case
in
276
u.s.,
i
believe
completely
disposes
that
argument.
