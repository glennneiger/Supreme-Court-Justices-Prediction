--
united

mr.
goldman,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
we
have
--
and
we
have
three
sales
made
simultaneously
and
he
was
charged
with
three
counts
of
--
of
sale.
could
you
charge
him
also
with
three
counts
of
purchasing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
got
the
narcotics
--
he's
got
the
narcotics
there
and
these
three
men
are
there,
a,
b,
c.
he
sells
to
a,
to
b,
to
c.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
authority
would
you
have
for
making
that
distinction
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
say
it
was
in
this
case.
i
said
if
it
was
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose,
you
had
--
suppose
you
charged
him
in
three
separate
indictments
and
you
wanted
to
charge
him
not
only
with
sale
but
with
the
purchase.
could
you
then
try
them
on
--
for
both
sale
and
--
sale
and
purchase?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murphy
may
i
--
may
i
ask
this
in
connection
with
your
discussion
of
gore
and
harris?
do
you
believe
that
that
in
this
indictment
you
could
also
charge
the
defendant
--
that
the
narcotics
were
not
stamped,
that
they
were
not
on
a
regular
form,
that
they
were
also
imported
and
a
number
of
other
things
that
the
statute
prescribes
and
or
proscribes
and
add
those
all
those
altogether
and
give
them
separate
sentences
on
each
one
of
them
in
addition
to
the
four
that
you
have
here?
in
other
words,
if
you
charge
a
man
with
possession,
sale,
dispensing,
and
distribution,
can
you
also
charge
him
with
--
with
illegally
importing
and
use
that
presumption
also
unstamped
--
unstamped
liquor
or
unstamped
narcotics
also
not
doing
it
on
the
usual
form
and
then
sentence
him
to
five
years
on
--
on
each
one
of
those
in
addition
to
before
you've
got
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you're
based
on
one
--
one
sale
such
as
we
have
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
just
take
this
one
--
take
this
one
sale
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
then
do
what
it
like
you
did
in
gore
and
do
like
you
did
with
it
in
--
in
the
harris
cases,
could
you
add
those
counts
on
to
--
on
to
this
count?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
count?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
addition
to
these
four?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
how
about
these
other
--
how
about
these
other
things
unstamped
liquor
and
narcotics
and
so
forth
and
import
it,
vould
you
add
those
two
to
--
to
this
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
i
mean,
could
--
could
you
support
a
conviction
in
this
case
if
you
had
--
if
you
had
those
separate
counts
in
the
indictment
in
addition
to
the
four
of
sale,
purchase,
dispensing
and
distribution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
it
be
both
selling
and
dispensing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
--
suppose
he
is
a
druggist,
suppose
he's
a
druggist
and
he
dispenses
the
narcotics
for
consideration.
has
he
both
dispensed
and
sold?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
has
he
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
distribution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
your
point
is
that
you
can
only
have
in
the
--
in
the
situation
of
this
kind
where
it
says
the
four
things
and
you
have
one
sale
that
you
can
only
have
sale
and
purchase
nothing
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
now
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you,
could
you
add
these
other
things
to
it
that
we've
been
talking
about
now.
the
--
the
failure
to
pay
the
tax,
the
failure
to
all
these
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
any
others,
any
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
murphy?
do
you
think
that
when
congress
reasoned
the
--
rephrased
the
sentencing
for
--
for
narcotics
violations
and
when
it
said
five
years
--
maximum
of
five
years
for
one
sale
and
10
years
for
a
second
offense,
that
it
had
in
--
in
mind
that
for
one
sale
such
as
we
have
here,
that
a
man
could
be
sentenced
to
not
five
years
but
seven
times
five
years
or
35
years
and
that
if
he
happen
to
have
another
conviction
prior
to
that,
that
it
could
be
not
35
but
70
years,
you
think
that
the
congress
had
that
in
mind
when
it
passed
that
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
that
on
another
occasion
been
convicted
of
--
of
sale
prior
--
prior
to
this
time,
do
--
do
you
think
that
congress
for
a
first
offense
of
this
kind
just
one
simple
sale
had
in
contemplation
that
a
man
could
be
sentenced
for
35
years
and
that
if
he
had
have
a
prior
conviction
that
he
could
be
sentenced
for
70
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
think
that
intended
--
the
congress
intended
that
that
should
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
there
were
some
--
some
legislators
who
wanted
to
hang
them,
wanted
to
execute
them.
some
wanted
to
give
them
life
imprisonment,
but
do
you
think
that
if
this
had
been
discussed
on
--
on
the
floor
that
congress
would
have
--
have
said
that
it
thought
that
these
should
be
pyramided
in
that
amount
for
a
first
offense
of
this
kind
of
simple
sale
to
a
--
to
a
government
agent,
is
he
entitled
to
35
years
imprisonment
and
if
he
had
another
--
another
conviction
prior
in
that,
70
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
had
three
--
you
had
three
on
one
sale,
haven't
we
which
made
15
years
for
a
first
offense
and
it
would
be
30
years
for
a
second
offense.
we
have
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
that
is
three,
why
--
why
not
five
or
seven
whichever
--
whichever
79
state
attorneys
chooses
to
use.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
would
have
to
be
rather
clear
that
congress
intended
to
do
that,
isn't
it
before
--
before
the
courts
would
support
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
stretch
the
intent
of
congress
shows
to
show
that
--
shows
to
permit
one
count
for
having
--
having
falsely
made
the
statement
and
the
second
count
that
was
fraudulent,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
distinguish
bell
where
--
where
a
panderer
went
out
enlisted
a
whole
carload
of
young
women
for
purposes
of
prostitution
and
merely
because
they
put
him
--
he
put
him
in
one
bus
to
take
them
across
the
state
line,
it
was
held
that
he'd
only
committed
one
offense.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
purpose
was
for
him
to
--
purpose
of
that
act
was
to
prohibit
him
from
--
from
soliciting
any
young
women
to
do
that,
wasn't
it?
he
took
the
whole
carload
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
this
court
--
this
court
said
because
it
was
a
carload
why
he
only
committed
one
offense,
but
here
the
man
--
man
makes
one
little
sale
to
narcotics
officer
and
do
you
say
that
he
can
--
you
can
have
seven
different
offenses
and
join
them
together,
give
them
seven
different
sentences.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
statute
didn't
say
--
statute
didn't
say
that
if
they
were
in
one
carriage
you
--
you
could
only
charge
him
for
taking
one
woman
across
the
line
anymore
than
--
than
it
says
something
similar
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
you
had
a
whole
--
there
you
had
a
carload
of
women
in
that
case
and
here
we
have
it
--
there's
only
one
--
only
one
act.
here
we
got
one
little
sale
and
we
have
a
whole
carload
of
counts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
any
carload
women
but
any
--
any
woman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
question
of
venue
before
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
why,
because
it
wasn't
raised
below?
is
that
--
is
that
the
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no
the
question
as
to
--
as
to
whether
they
must
either
know
there
is
a
presumption
that
it
was
purchased
that
they
must
establish
that
it
was
within
the
district
where
he
was
being
tried.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
reason
--
that's
the
reason
it's
not
before
us,
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goldberg.
