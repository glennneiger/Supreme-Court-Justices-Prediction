mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
the
court,
from
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
a
case
that
originated
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan's
southern
division.
the
petitioner
was
tried
and
convicted
under
two
counts
of
an
information,
dated
may
17,
1954,
charging
violation
of
the
narcotics
act,
section
2553
(a)
title
26,
u.s.
code.
one
count
charged
the
appellant
with
the
unlawful
purchase
for
quantity
of
heroine
on
may
17,
1954,
and
the
other
charge,
the
unlawful
sale
of
the
same
quantity
heroine
on
the
same
day.
at
the
time
this
petition
was
filed,
there
were
pending
before
this
court,
two
cases
--
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes,
your
honor.
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed,
there
were
pending
two
cases
before
this
court
that
were
somewhat
similar,
but
which
i
shall
distinguish
in
my
argument.
a
first
case
was
the
case
of
gore
versus
united
states
on
which
petitioner
placed
great
reliance
and
as
incorporated
in
part
the
arguments
that
were
expounded
at
length
and
considered
fully
by
the
court
as
to
legislative
history,
as
to
double
jeopardy.
although
i
have
repeated
these
arguments
in
my
brief
and
i
have
presented
them
for
reconsideration
by
the
court,
i
am
aware
that
the
court
has
answered
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
in
the
general
propositions
raised
by
me
when
the
petition
was
filed
and
also
the
question
of
lenity
in
the
application
or
interpretation
of
the
narcotics
act.
i
distinguish
the
gore
case
and
the
harris
case
which
came
down
after
my
brief
was
filed
before
the
government's
brief
was
filed
in
the
following
particular
which
i
think
is
significant.
this
particular,
i
think,
for
instance
very
clearly
within
the
language
of
the
blockburger
case
which
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
both
felt
of
necessity
ruled
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
could
be
sentenced
to
consecutive
sentences
rather
than
to
concurrent
sentences.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes.
he's
been
in
jail
since
commitment.
he
will
–
i
believe
he
has
begun
his
second
sentence
at
this
point.
he's
in
the
reformatory
of
(inaudible)
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
may
17,
1954,
i
believe
he
was
sentenced
on
a
later
date
than
that.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
the
first
five
years
yes,
your
honor.
i
i
understand
that
he
would
be
eligible
in
approximately
15
months
for
a
good
time
parole.
the
point
of
distinction
that
i
make
is
this
that
under
each
case
that
has
come
before
this
court,
there
were
separate
statutes
involved.
in
the
gore
case,
there
were
three
separate
statutes
involved
in
the
information
under
which
the
government
proceeded
to
convict
the
defendant.
under
the
harris
case,
there
were
two
separate
statutes
involved
under
which
the
government
proceeded
to
convict
the
defendant.
in
the
gore
case,
i
refresh
the
court's
recollection
that
he
was
charged
under
separate
sections
of
the
code.
first,
the
sale
of
narcotics
have
pursuant
to
a
written
order
form;
second,
purchase
sale
and
distribution
not
in
or
from
a
stamp
package
and
third,
transportation
and
concealment
of
illegally
imported
narcotics.
i
recognize
that
the
three
offenses
derived
from
one
transaction
that
was
the
sale
of
narcotics,
the
distinction
i
make
however
between
the
gore
case
and
the
instant
case
is
that
only
one
section
of
the
code,
only
one
section
of
the
statute
was
charged
in
the
instant
case.
that
though
i
make
the
same
distinction
in
the
harris
case
where
the
respondent
was
charged
with
the
purchase
of
heroine
from
another
stamped
package
and
second,
receiving
and
concealing
this
drug
knowing
it
to
have
been
unlawfully
imported.
in
this
case
again,
there
were
two
separate
sections
of
the
statute
deriving
from
separate
avenues
of
legislative
history,
which
were
examined
very
carefully
by
this
court.
and
in
that
instance
also,
the
two
separate
sections
of
the
statute
were
the
basis
upon
which
the
conviction
was
sustained
in
the
lower
court.
the
language
employed
by
this
court
in
the
harris
case
was
that
the
violation
as
distinguished
from
the
direct
evidence
offered
to
prove
that
violation
was
distinctly
different
and
i
stress
at
this
point,
under
each
of
the
respective
statutes.
now
in
this
instance,
the
statute
involved
was
26
u.s.
code
255
3
(a),
and
it
read
in
part
as
follows.
“it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
purchase,
sell,
dispense
or
distribute
any
of
the
drugs
mentioned
in
section
2550
(a)
except
in
the
original
stamped
package
or
from
the
original
stamped
package.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
no
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes
your
honor.
under
the
theory
that
the
court's
applied
below
that
although
he
was
charged
under
only
one
section
of
the
statute,
he
could
have
taken
each
of
the
offenses
under
that
theory
and
said
that
he
could
be
charged
with
purchasing,
selling,
dispensing,
distributing.
they
would
have
had
to
stop
there
for
the
other
sections
of
the
statute
were
contained
under
different
sections
in
the
--
under
the
theory
employed
by
the
courts
below
he
could
have
received
a
five-year
or
two
to
five
years
sentence
being
a
first
offender
under
each
of
these
sections.
that
is
the
only
point
of
distinguishment
that
we
argue
here
although
i
raise
in
the
brief
the
other
elements
which
have
been
able
argued
by
counsel
in
the
proceeding
cases
which
i
have
mentioned
and
that
are
so
recently
before
the
court.
i
do
not
feel
that
it
merits
rearguing
them.
i
have
nothing
to
add
to
the
able
arguments
which
they
propose
on
these
items,
but
i
do
feel
that
this
case
is
distinguished
from
those
and
falls
very
clearly
within
the
language
of
the
blockburger
case
of
a
single
transaction,
whether
it
be
applied
to
the
question
of
evidence
or
the
only
evidence
are
offered
here
to
prove
any
of
these
offenses
would
be
the
same
or
whether
the
court
approached
it
from
the
theory
that
each
section
of
a
statute
derived
from
a
different
historical
basis
and
constituted
a
different
offense.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
argument
yesterday,
i
started
by
saying
that
we,
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief
had
contended
that
the
sentencing
on
to
two
consecutive
sentences
constituted
double
jeopardy
and
we
also
argued
the
questions
of
the
interpretation
of
a
statute
and
the
application
of
lenity
in
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
stated
at
that
time
and
i
repeat
today
that
i
do
not
propose
in
my
argument
to
stress
those
points,
they
having
been
very
amply
argued
by
counsel
in
two
very
recent
cases
and
the
court
having
ruled
upon
those
two
arguments.
i
distinguish
the
yancy
case
from
the
two
cases,
the
gore
case
and
the
harris
case
which
were
recently
before
the
court
in
one
significant
particular.
that
fact
is
that
in
the
yancy
case
only
one
section
of
the
statute
was
set
forth
in
the
information
upon
which
the
two
counts
were
founded
and
upon
which
mr.
yancy
was
convicted.
in
support
of
a
claim
of
error
by
the
trial
court,
i
refer
first
to
the
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law
and
the
order
overruling
the
motion
to
correct
the
sentence
which
is
on
page
16
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
in
which
the
trial
court
held,
it
is
further
held
that
the
court
has
within
it
its
discretion
the
right
to
impose
two
or
more
sentences
on
separate
counts
and
in
an
indictment
or
information
and
have
been
run
consecutively
and
the
court
cites
as
its
authority
the
blockburger
versus
united
states,
284
u.s.
299.
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
the
decision
of
the
district
court
also
relied
upon
the
blockburger
case
and
cited
the
blockburger
case
as
its
authority
for
having
to
sustain
or
affirm
the
order
of
the
district
court.
on
page
23
and
22
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
his
opinion
set
forth
in
denying
this
branch
of
the
motion,
the
district
court
didn't
no
more
than
follow
a
broken
line
of
judicial
authority
and
again
commences
with
blockburger
versus
united
states.
the
blockburger
case,
it
is
our
contention,
did
not
provide
a
basis
of
authority
for
sustaining
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
where
in
the
blockburger
case
and
the
gore
case,
the
harris
case,
and
every
case
that
i
have
found,
that
has
come
before
this
court
and
its
consideration
more
than
one
section
of
the
statute
has
been
cited
as
the
--
the
basis
for
the
information
or
the
indictment
in
which
ever
case
it
was
and
for
the
consecutive
sentences.
the
blockburger
case
itself
arose
from
separate
statutes
and
they
were
set
forth
in
separate
statutes
and
i
feel
that
the
pertinent
language
on
page
304
of
the
blockburger
case,
which
sets
forth
its
rule,
is
that
the
applicable
rule
is
that
where
the
same
act
or
transaction
constitutes
a
violation
of
two
distinct
statutory
provisions,
the
test
to
be
applied
to
determine
whether
there
are
two
offenses
or
only
one
is
whether
each
provision
requires
proof
of
a
fact
which
the
other
does
not.
and
i
stress
the
language
of
a
violation
of
two
distinct
statutory
provisions
which
is
not
the
fact
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
after
the
gore
decision
and
after
the
harris
decision,
i
don't
believe
that
i
would
be
here
renewing
the
same
arguments
which
they
made.
that
was
the
conten
--
my
original
contention
i
frankly
admit
was
that
no
matter
whether
they
cited
separate
sections
of
the
statute
that
this
constituted
double
punishment
or
double
jeopardy.
in
view
of
the
recent
decisions
of
the
court,
i
cannot
maintain
that
position.
i
feel
that
that
is
--
i
may
respectfully
disagree
with
that
position,
but
that
is
the
law
and
it
has
been
stated
very
clearly
after
exhaustive
argument
by
counsel
and
examination
by
the
court
that
that
is
the
law.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
that
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
passed,
this
was
considered
as
one
crime,
the
various
elements
that
were
named
were
all
parts
of
one
crime.
they
did
not
arise
as
the
separate
sections
that
the
statute
did
from
different
historical
precedence,
tax
problems,
importation
problems,
and
controls
of
criminal
acts.
this
particular
section,
i
think
it
is
similar
to
crimes
of
violence
that
we
have
where
the
man
maybe
charged
with
committing
a
felonious
act
with
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon.
under
our
state
laws
where
they
list
various
forms
of
weapons
that
he
might
use
in
the
statute
yet
upon
conviction
of
making
a
deadly
assault
with
a
gun
and
a
knife
and
poison,
i
think
that
upon
the
same
instance
whether
there's
only
one
act,
there
would
only
be
one
conviction.
the
prosecution
might
have
different
channels
to
approach
that
one
conviction.
in
this
instance,
it
being
one
section
of
a
statute
subsequently
separated,
there
are
separated
--
subsequently
separated
into
distinct
sections
to
the
statute
that
there
was
only
one
criminal
act
permitted
although
they
separated
into
counts.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes,
subsequent
amendments
have.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
stated
as
violation
of
two
separate
sections.
they
quoted
the
separate
the
--
later
sections
of
the
act
26,
u.s.c.a.
4704
and
26
u.s.c.a
7237.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
i
don't
believe
in
this
instance
that
it
would
be
a
mere
formalization.
i
think
that
in
this
instance
the
--
the
essence
of
the
act,
of
this
--
this
particular
section
was
confined
to
a
sale
although
it
--
it
limited
--
it
--
it
enumerated
other
aspects
that
would
be
connected
with
the
sale.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
i
am
--
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
that
would
have
been
--
i
--
i
believe
that
defined
in
two
separate
actions
or
separate
sections
of
the
statute.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
i
believe
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
position,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
either
separate
statutes
your
honor
or
separate
sections
of
the
statute
not
a
series
of
words
being
used
in
a
continuous
context.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes
your
honor.
the
--
my
reasoning
for
that
is
that
in
order
for
there
to
have
been
a
sale
which
was
the
matter
of
proof
in
this
instance,
there
would
have
to
be
some
element
of
possession
in
the
part
of
the
seller
whether
it
be
by
purchase
or
by
felonious
taking
or
in
some
other
fashion
he
had
to
have
it
to
sell
it
and
that
this
is
the
context
of
the
statute
at
the
time
that
it
was
--
this
man
was
brought
before
the
court.
there
were
in
effect
at
that
time,
by
separate
sections
of
a
statute
under
which
he
could
have
been
prosecuted
providing
for
the
same
items.
illegal
importation,
illegal
purchases
were
at
that
time,
as
i
recall,
provided
for
under
separate
sections
of
the
statute
as
well
as
under
the
one
section
in
which
the
prosecution
proceeded.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
that
would
depend
upon
the
history
of
the
act.
if
these
all
arose
from
one
portion
of
a
historical
development
at
this
particular
section
of
the
act
say
came
from
the
development
of
a
criminal
rather
than
a
tax
aspect,
it
might
be
my
--
it
would
probably
be
my
position
that
this
would
constitute
one
offense
just
as
it
did
here.
i
don't
think
that
i
would
be
in
a
stronger
position
in
my
thinking
if
i
found
that
each
section
of
the
statute
came
as
a
--
from
different
sources
and
were
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
them
under
one
head
placed
under
one
heading
and
each
section
had
a
different
historical
background
then
i
would
not
have
a
tenable
position
to
argue
that
this
was
a
one
offense
although
contained
under
one
statutory
heading.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
no
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
no.
i
don't
--
i
don't
raise
that
question.
the
--
i
believe
that
the
presumption
under
the
statute
is
a
lawful
presumption.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
as
to
sale,
i
would
say
no.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
the
--
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
no,
your
honor,
there
was
no
transcript,
no
official
transcript
made
of
the
proceedings
at
the
--
in
the
district
court.
i
did
not
represent
the
petitioner
on
the
district
court.
i
have
read
an
unofficial
transcript
and
it's
my
recollection
that
the
item
of
heroine
was
introduced
at
the
trial,
775
grains.
there
was
a
testimony
made
as
to
the
sale.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
to
the
narc
--
special
agent
of
the
department.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
no.
the
only
other
item
which
i
wish
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
which
--
to
which
i
made
brief
reference
yesterday
is
the
fact
that
the
man
was
a
first
defender,
that
he
has
been
continuously
in
prison
for
over
five
years.
he
has
commenced
his
second
five-year
sentence
at
this
point.
that
concludes
my
argument,
sir.
mr.
seymour
b.
goldman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
attempting
to
determine
a
statutory
test,
a
careful
examination
of
a
language
of
the
--
of
section
2553
(a)
shows
that
with
the
exception
of
the
word
“purchase”,
the
other
words
all
fall
within
one
context,
sell,
dispense,
or
distribute
narcotics.
i
think
it
is
only
fair
in
interpreting
this
particular
section
to
take
all
of
its
language
as
one,
since
other
sections
of
the
act
made
provision
for
other
violations.
so,
that
to
separate
the
word,
“purchase”
and
treat
it
as
differently
from
the
words
sell,
dispense,
or
distribute
narcotic
drugs
is
in
an
improper
interpretation
of
what
the
legislature
intended
by
this
one
single
enactment.
now,
i
have
reread
the
language
in
the
albrecht
case
and
i
agree
that
if
congress
and
i
made
this
in
my
argument
that
if
congress
had
broken
down
each
of
these
activities
into
separate
offenses
and
had
prescribed
separate
punishments
that
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
constitution
as
currently
stated
from
punishing
separately
each
step
leading
to
the
consummation
of
a
transaction.
i
believe
that's
what
the
albrecht
case
stands
for.
in
this
instance,
however,
the
prosecution
proceeded
only
under
one
section,
one
subsection
of
the
act
and
that
is
the
final
--
the
position
upon
which
we
rely
that
there
was
no
in
this
particular
case
they
did
not
choose
different
avenues
of
punishment
but
chose
only
one
or
a
prosecution
but
chose
only
one.
they
can
stand
holding
upon
one
offense
under
one
avenue.
