justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
is
this
at
the
senate
or
cited
second
sentences
--
first
sentence
as
five
years
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
was
the
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
this
was
convicted
with
starting
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
there
had
been
a
separate
section
on
the
sale
and
a
separate
section
on
the
purchase,
am
i
to
infer
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
if
you
(inaudible)
of
the
issue
about
--
about
the
section,
is
it
not
that
our
argument
was
on
the
basis
upon
(inaudible)
within
one
section.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
statute
has
been
broken
down?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
as
to
the
narcotics
agents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
about
it
is
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
active
vendor
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
might
come
(inaudible).
it's
your
recollection
you
would
have
to
define
--
said
the
informal
transcripts
of
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
there
might
be
a
problem
here
of
exhaustion
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
presumption
since
the
government
approved
affirmative
testimony
in
the
charge
under
the
same
section
of
the
sale.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
having
--
having
done
that
is
the
government
or
not
in
the
position
where
it
can't
now
rely
on
the
presumption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
i'm
just
wondering
whether
--
when
the
government
affirmatively
characterizes
the
possession
by
introducing
affirmative
evidence
that
there
was
a
sale
to
a
narcotics
agent,
whether
it
may
then
turn
that
the
presumption
say
or
that
same
possession,
the
jury
may
infer
proves
a
purchase
which
is
to
say
the
very
opposite.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
following
you
then,
what
that
means
is
had
there
been
four
counts,
purchase,
sale,
dispensing
and
distributing.
you
could
use
the
presumption
to
support
anyone
of
the
four
but
as
to
the
other
three,
you'd
have
to
have
affirmative
evidence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
use
of
a
purchase
should
have
that
affirmative
evidence
for
sale,
dispensing,
and
distribution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
is
there
now
a
separate
section
with
sale?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
murphy,
am
i
correct
that
the
court
held
that
(inaudible)
on
the
statute
adopted
a
different
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
--
did
the
court
find
the
significance
on
the
fact
that
they're
adopted
15
times
has
bearing
on
the
congressional
desires
or
severity
in
dealing
with
these
terms.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
court
find
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
know
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
were
there
heavy
reliance
upon
that
fact
bearing
on
the
result.
i
--
i
would
suppose
if
that
--
if
that
so,
that
argument
is
not
available
in
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
have
to
rely
on
something
else
though
(inaudible)
the
reliance
had
in
gore,
harris
defined
here
or
reasonable,
i
think
there
should
be
more
than
one
offense
--
prosecution
of
more
than
one
offense
under
the
same
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when,
when
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
murphy
and
this
section
has
been
broken
up.
i
know
your
adversary
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
i
have
4704
before
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that
should
be
identical
with
the
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
that
has
a
change.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
has
there
been
a
breakup
of
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
subsequent
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
identical
with
the
one
that
we
were
dealing
with.
