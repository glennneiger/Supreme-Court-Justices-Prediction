justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
goldman,
may
i
ask
you
please?
do
you
think
that
the
blockburger
case
in
its
usable
language
on
page
304
of
distinct
statutory
provisions
means
separate
statutes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
then
think
that
the
word
“purchase”
and
the
word
“sell”
goes
up
within
the
commerce
view
are
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
blockburger
case
distinct
statutory
provisions.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
i
assume
that
you're
argument
(inaudible)
takes
the
position
though
the
government
need
not,
it
voluntarily
did
in
this
information
confined
each
count
to
an
allegation
of
violation
of
the
same
statute
and
was
thereby
stuck
with
it,
is
that
the
idea?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
have
(inaudible)
of
whether
this
statute
may
lawfully
make
possession
a
prima
facie
case
of
sale
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
do
not
have
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
it
be
a
sale
if
one
has
the
goods
in
his
hand?
could
it
be
presumed
he
has
sold
them?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do
not
remind
on
that
here
because
there
was
affirmative
evidence
of
a
sale,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
government
relies
upon
presumption
or
the
prima
facie
case
was
made
with
the
statute
to
supply
the
high
risk
in
the
purchase
aspect,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
aid
by
permission
of
this
(inaudible),
do
you
confer
that
that's
the
issue
of

with
congressional

that
there'd
be
respectively
four
gallons
there.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
from
the
sale
one
through
possession,
one
through
expenses,
and
one
through
distribution.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
offence
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
be
subject
to
sale,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
fact,
this
would
