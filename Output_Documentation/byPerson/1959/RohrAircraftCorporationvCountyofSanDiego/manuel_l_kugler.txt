mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
the
court
pleases.
i
will
confine
my
remarks,
with
the
court's
permission,
merely
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
the
appellant
has
come
before
this
court
on
the
basis
of
subsection
(2)
of
the
code
in
which
he
states
that
there
has
--
that
there
is
present
here
and
that
he
has
drawn
in
to
question
the
validity
of
a
statute
of
the
state
on
the
ground
that
it
is
repugnant
to
the
constitution,
treaties
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
decision
a
--
there's
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
validity.
this
is
the
burden
of
the
appellant
to
--
to
prove
this
that
he
has
met
these
conditions
where
the
court
has
previously
said
that
these
conditions
must
be
complied
with
closely
because
this
is
a
limit
on
the
court's
jurisdiction
under
an
appeal.
he
has
made
a
broad
reference
in
the
courts
below
to
our
taxing
statutes.
he
has
cited
no
specific
statute
or
statutes.
the
court
has
said
that
in
prior
occasion
that
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
the
tax
infringes
on
a
federal
right
or
immunity
but
that
he
--
he
must
be
specific.
he
must
make
a
substantial
effort
to
point
out
where
there
is
a
state
law
involved
or
state
laws
so
that
in
fact,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
may
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
reviewed
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
law
against
federal
laws
and
statutes.
and
this,
he
has
failed
to
do.
i
would
observe
to
your
honors
that
the
--
mr.
leroy
wright
has
observed
that
this
--
and
as
he
said
it
in
effect
that
the
law,
he
spoke
of
attacking
the
tax
and
that
this,
in
effect,
wasn't
attacked
on
the
statutes.
but
the
court
in
the
wilson
case,
wilson
versus
cook,
which
is
in
the
briefs,
327
u.s.,
has
stated
in
so
many
words
that
it
is
not
enough
to
attack
the
tax
but
he
must
attack
the
statutes
and
this,
he
has
failed
to
do.
and
so
this
i
don't
believe
as
he
has
stated
as
a
detailing
without
realism.
the
--
the
state
court
has
never
nor
have
the
state
courts
ever
passed
upon
the
--
any
particular
statute.
our
--
our
laws
regarding
taxes
are
on
harmony
with
the
federal
laws
and
constitution,
nor
do
i
believe
that
this
court
is
being
asked
to
overturn
any
particular
state
statute.
the
only
issue
here,
as
i
see
it,
and
the
only
issue
raised
by
the
appellant
in
the
courts
below
and
ruled
on
and
passed
upon
by
the
california
courts
has
merely
been
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
laws
we
are
faced
with,
the
reconstruction
finance
act,
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944.
the
california
court
if
it
had
decided
that
there
was
--
that
this
property
was
not
taxable
under
federal
law
and
that's
all
it
directed
its
attention
to
is
federal
law
and
the
interpretation
of
it
and
what
was
constitution
--
the
congressional
intent,
then
the
california
laws
would
have
followed
naturally
and
there
would
not
have
been
a
tax
or
the
tax
would
not
have
been
sustained.
on
the
other
hand,
the
--
the
courts
below
decided
that
the
federal
congressional
intent
was
to
--
to
allow
this
property
to
be
taxed
and
thus,
the
california
laws
followed
in
natural
sequence.
i
would
say
further
that
the
beaver
case
and
the
allegheny
case
cited
by
council
are
not
in
support
of
his
position
in
the
least.
in
both
cases,
we
have
writ
of
error
and
writ
of
appeal
to
this
court.
in
each
instance,
we
had
an
instance
where
there
was
a
specific
state
statute
involving
the
interpretation
and
meaning
of
what
constituted
real
property.
in
the
allegheny
case,
it
was
having
machinery
and
the
case
of
the
beaver
case,
it
involved
the
definition
of
fixtures
as
being
real
property.
and
the
courts
--
the
lower
courts
had
to
pass
upon
this.
this
was
a
main
argument
and
subsequently,
of
course,
the
united
states
allowed
writs
of
appeal
in
these
cases
because
down
below,
there
had
been
great
emphasis
placed
upon
the
interpretation
of
state
laws
as
applied
and
the
validity
of
those
state
laws
was
drawn
in
to
the
question
and
the
question
of
whether
it
is
repugnant
or
not
to
the
federal
constitution
was
dealt
with.
we
have
no
situation
here.
counsel
has
not
carried
the
burden
which
his
was
--
his
responsibility.
and
in
our
opinion,
this
writ
does
not
lie.
thank
you.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
yes
--
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
--
justice
whittaker.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
was
what
they
were
--
were
aiming
to
determine
that
they
were
--
they
had
to
go
through
the
vehicle
of
determining
what
the
state
statute
meant,
whether
the
state
statute
applied,
whether
the
definition
in
the
state
statute
would
control
and
there
was
this
interpretation
of
local
law
which
was
present
--
which
has
never
been
present
in
this
case.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
that
--
that
certainly
is
a
question
which
i
think
raised
by
appellant.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
perhaps,
you're
correct
but
--
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
yes,
yes,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
we
--
we
must
concede
there's
a
merit
to
that
but
that
the
issue
is
this
that
under
--
under
the
--
the
rules
of
this
court
and
the
decisions
of
this
court,
including
the
wilson
case,
as
i
observed,
wilson
versus
cook,
327
u.s.
474,
the
court
observed
that
the
--
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
disclosed
at
anytime
in
the
course
of
proceedings.
in
the
state
court,
plaintiff
asserted
the
invalidity
of
a
state
statute
on
any
federal
ground.
the
--
the
court
considered
only
the
validity
of
the
tax
not
that
of
the
statute.
as
i
see
it,
your
honor,
it
isn't
a
question
of
what
appellant
could
have
done
in
the
courts
below,
it's
a
question
of
what
he
did
do
and
then
he
placed
any
emphasis
upon
this
down
below
and
was
there
a
state
statute
or
state
court
which
passed
upon
the
validity
of
the
--
the
particular
state
statute
which
was
raised,
in
this
case,
wasn't
as
being
repugnant
to
the
federal
constitution.
it's
not
what
he
could
have
done
but
what
he
did
do.
and
objecting
to
the
tax
is
not
objecting
to
a
statute
according
to
the
wilson
versus
cook
case.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
well
--
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
no,
that's
true,
mr.
--
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
--
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
of
course,
that's
our
position
that
these
--
these
courts
below
and
certainly
the
california
supreme
court
know
where
they
ask
to,
did
they
spend
any
time
in
discussing
the
validity
of
california
statute.
they
were
concerned
only
with
congressional
intent
in
the
rfc
law
and
in
the
1944
surplus
property
act.
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
yes.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
well,
that
--
that's
true.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
that's
precisely
true.
and
of
course,
as
i
said,
the
--
the
--
this
court
before
on
prior
occasions
has
made
the
point
that
--
that
challenging
the
tax
is
not
enough
under
this
rule.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
oh,
no,
your
honor.
but
we
--
we
would
concede
that
certainly
its
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
go
to
that
if
it
wishes
but,
of
course,
we
were
making
the
point
in
--
because
a
right
of
appeal
--
because
of
error
which
counsel
has
taken
course
to
this
court
as
a
matter
of
--
of
right
as
opposed
to
a
matter
of
discretion
--
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
--
in
the
court
of
certiorari
and
--
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
--
give
you
more
chance
to
adopt
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
no,
no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
manuel
l.
kugler
thank
you
very
much.
