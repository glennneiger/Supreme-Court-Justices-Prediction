a
deed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
deed
from
rfc?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
whom
to
whom?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
went
from
rfc
to
war
assets
corporation,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
i'm
not
interested,
not
in
words,
not
to
known
but
is
the
deed
a
formal
deed
the
way
one
agency
of
government
transfers
to
another?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
stumble
on
the
issue
in
the
case
by
an
innocent
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
congress
and
what
session?
justice
felix
frankfurter
84th?
justice
felix
frankfurter
first
session.
1453,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
baum
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
to
satisfy
curiosity
--
about
transfer
for
properties
to
one
agency
of
government
(inaudible)
reconstruction
finance
(inaudible)?
there's
been
a
good
--
there
have
been
a
good
many
of
this
certainly
since
the
recent
reorganization
acts
beginning
(inaudible)
property
may
lease
etcetera,
etcetera
all
over
the
place
when
--
when
the
things
are
merged
over
department
of
health,
welfare
and
education
was
created.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
transfer
of
real
estate,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
practice
of
the
government
it
effectuated?
what
is
the
mechanism
for
the
--
the
(inaudible)
for
effectuating
your
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
deed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
with
the
answer
--
i
mean
a
statutory
situation
may
make
a
--
produce
a
different
result?
i
don't
think
that
answer
is
properly
(inaudible),
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
--
what
the
routine
way
of
doing
business
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
inter-department
for
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
but
then
i
don't
know
how
many
executive
orders
making
all
sorts
of
transfers
from
one
department
to
another,
from
one
bureau
to
another,
from
one
agency
to
another,
and
i
--
i
--
that's
why
my
initial
question
of
surprise,
i
suspect,
there
are
seldom
deeds,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
who
got
that
deed?
who
was
--
what
first
--
who
was
the
united
states,
who
was
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
grantee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
the
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
recorded
in
the
registry
of
deed
here
in
the
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
mean
in
kansas.
do
you
think
it's
recorded
in
the
registry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
registration
fee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
humanly
speaking,
this
is
the
first
tree
of
light
i
have
without
any
innuendo
against
counsel's
argument,
this
is
the
first
tree
of
light
i
have
on
meaning
of
this
case,
namely,
the
human
desire
of
mr.
larson
that
this
should
not
be
withdrawn
from
the
taxing
power
of
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
you
--
you
wouldn't
have
the
problem
if
you
didn't
have
a
state
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
because
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
state
couldn't
levy
it.
but
otherwise
than
that,
the
state
statute
doesn't
make
itself
(inaudible)
in
any
immediate
sense
or
even
its
application
to
property
that's
immune
from
taxation.
they
don't
--
the
answer
to
that
question
turns
on
federal
materials
and
now
in
state
materials,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
of
how
far
back
you
go,
i'm
saying
that
you
really
implicate
a
matter
of
validity
of
the
state
statute
either
directly
or
--
or
either
on
its
face
by
implication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
the
state
statute
has
entangled
this?
you
said
otherwise
it
be
no
proper,
you
didn't
have
a
state
statute,
a
question
could
never
arise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
all
the
--
all
the
shooting
is
about
not
the
state
statute
but
things
outside
of
it.
