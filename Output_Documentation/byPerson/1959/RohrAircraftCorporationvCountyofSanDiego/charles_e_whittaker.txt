justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
might
raise
questions,
might
it
not,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
rfc
is
an
agency
in
the
sense
used
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
doesn't
that
assume
the
question
--
one
of
the
questions
in
issue,
namely,
that
this
is
property
of
the
united
states?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
the
corporation
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
use
the
words
of
the
act.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
and
--
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
transferred
to
rfc.
you
mean
by
the
declaration?
is
that
what
you
used
as
synonymous
with
transfer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
was
the
definition,
was
it
not,
that
was
promulgated
by
congress
to
avoid
the
effects
of
the
court
of
claims
decision?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
--
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
mr.
baum,
that
this
statute
permits
the
same
taxation
in
lieu
of
taxes
rather
which
the
court
of
claims
held
could
not
be
imposed
as
taxes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
stop
you
right
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
precisely
gives
what
was
held
by
a
claim.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
baum,
may
i
ask
you?
is
any
light
shed
on
this
problem
by
the
quitclaim
deed
made
by
rfc
to
the
united
states
shown
at
record
105
under
date
of
march
17,
1955?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
kugler,
may
i
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
ask
you
a
question
about
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
please?
in
the
beacon
and
allegheny
cases,
was
not
the
question
a
little
bit
more
than
further
this
was
real
property,
was
it
not,
is
this
real
property
of
the
united
states?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
what
have
you
to
say
of
this?
the
challenge
here
of
lawfulness
of
the
tax
is
upon
the
ground
that
the
state
has
no
power
to
impose
it,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then,
implicitly,
doesn't
that
raise
some
question
why
and
namely,
that
the
state
statute,
as
applied,
violates
the
federal
constitution
without
--
without
saying
it
in
words
isn't
that
inherently
and
implicitly
and
necessarily
involved?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
i
don't
know
--
i'd
like
(voice
overlap)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
you
say,
you
have
no
right
to
assess
the
tax
because
to
do
so
would
violate
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
aren't
you
saying
that
to
apply
your
state
statute
to
effect
collection
of
the
tax
is
what
violates
this
--
the
federal
constitution
and
therefore,
the
state
statute,
when
so
applied,
violates
the
constitution?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
--
do
you,
by
that
argument,
sustain
this
right
that
all
property,
whether
owned
by
the
rfc
or
if
not
by
its
name
is
property
of
the
united
states
not
subject
therefore
to
taxation?
