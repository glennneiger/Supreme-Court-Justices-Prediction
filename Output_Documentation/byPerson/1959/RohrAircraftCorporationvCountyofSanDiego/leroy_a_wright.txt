mr.
leroy
a.
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
area
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
and
submission
through
taxation
which
is
not
heretofore
been
determined
by
this
court.
briefly,
the
salient
facts
are,
in
1942
and
1943,
the
defense
plant
corporation,
a
subsidiary
of
rfc
acquired
and
improved
certain
property
in
the
san
diego
county.
that
property
was
leased
to
a
war
contractor,
the
predecessor
of
this
appellant.
it
was
used
during
the
war
and
the
manufacture
of
war
material.on
october
15th
of
1945,
the
lessee
contractor
terminated
the
links.
on
may
29th,
1946,
reconstruction
finance
corporation
declared
the
property
surplus
under
the
provisions
of
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944.
from
1947
to
1948,
the
property
was
taken
over
by
war
assets
administration.
it
was
actually
used,
as
appears
from
testimony,
herein
the
record
at
page
45.
it
was
actually
used
by
the
united
states
as
a
depot
for
the
storage
and
sale
of
surplus
war
material.
the
former
lessee
had
vacated
the
property.
in
1948,
there
commenced
an
interim
occupancy
by
the
former
lessee
who
owned
property
immediately
adjacent
to
the
area.
this
interim
occupancy
resulted
in
the
lease
of
september
1,
1949.
this
lease
is
set
forth
in
the
record
and
appears
--
commencing
at
page
9.
the
lease
required
the
lessee
to
pay
taxes
that
were
roughly
assessed
against
the
premises
or
against
the
lessor
or
lessee.
now,
let
us
go
back
for
a
moment.
here
is
government
property
admittedly
owned
by
a
governmental
agency,
the
defense
plant
corporation,
a
subsidiary
of
rfc.
this
being
so,
how
come
any
taxes?
in
1932
with
the
enactment
of
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
act,
the
congress
concerted
a
provision
which
it
drew
from
the
old
national
bank
act,
first
enacted
in
18th
--
in
the
19th
century.
under
which,
real
property
of
the
corporation
or
was
subjected
to
tax
to
the
same
extent
as
any
other
property
was
taxed
and
expressed
waiver
applicable
to
real
property
of
the
corporation.
therein
lay
the
basis
for
the
tax.
in
the
interim
however
by
the
enactment
of
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944,
mechanics
were
created
by
which
an
owning
agency
defined
in
the
acts
in
terms
to
encompass
rfc
would
declare
that
the
--
the
property
was
surplus
to
its
needs
and
would
execute
a
declaration
of
surplus
property
which
would
be
transmitted
to
the
war
assets
administration.
the
war
assets
administration
would
then
have
the
responsibility
for
the
control,
management,
maintenance
with
all
of
the
various
attributes
which
the
surplus
property
act
gave
to
the
united
states
as
a
result
of
the
declaration.
the
provisions
of
the
surplus
property
act
insofar
as
here
applicable
are
contained
in
appendix
a
to
appellant's
opening
brief
at
pages
1
to
8
and
regulations
which
were
issued
thereunder
are
further
contained
in
the
that
appendix.
the
case
thus
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
failure
of
rfc
to
execute
a
deed
to
the
property
at
the
time
that
it
issued
its
declaration
of
the
surplus
to
its
needs.
the
failure
of
rfc
to
execute
that
deed
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
--
still
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
to
the
united
states.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
there
was
no
deed,
formal
deed
under
the
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
from
rfc
to
the
united
states
of
america,
such
a
deed
was
subsequently
issued
and
recorded
in
1955
but
not
at
the
time.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
by
virtue
of
the
declaration
that
it
was
surplus.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
we
think
not,
sir.
that
is
our
position
that
the
transfer
was
fully
into
war
intention
purposes
accomplished
by
the
declaration
made
by
rfc
that
the
property
was
surplus
to
its
needs.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
you
did,
sir.[laughter]
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
i
think
not,
sir,
under
the
decision.
i'm
thinking
now
of
decision
in
graves
against
new
york
involving
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation
and
various
other
decisions
involving
the
nature
of
governmental
activities
or
governmental
corporations.
they
exist
only
for
the
performance
of
a
true
governmental
function,
and
would
it
not
for
the
expressed
waiver
of
proper
--
relating
to
property
of
the
corporation
which
is
contained
in
the
rfc
act.
i
think
it
is
admitted
by
all
where
any
property
by
own
--
by
any
governmental
corporation
which
those
not
have
in
its
an
enacting
statute
that
expressed
congressional
waiver
to
tax
is,
as
to
its
property,
immune
from
local
tax.
it
has
long
been
held
that
government
corporations
have
no
independent
existence
that
they
are
used
and
are
utilized
by
our
national
government
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
governmental
functions.
this
case
then
presents
an
issue
of
whether
or
not
constitutional
immunity
from
tax
will
rest
on
formalisms
as
this
court
has
said
recently
in
united
states
against
muskegon
through
justice
black,
constitutional
immunity
does
not
rest
on
such
insubstantial
formalities
as
whether
the
party
using
government
property
is
formally
designated
as
a
lessee,
otherwise
immunity
can
be
conferred
by
simple
stroke
of
the
draftsman's
pen.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
no,
what
was
done
here
was
--
was
typical
--
typical.
in
this
case,
at
the
outset,
i
want
to
point
out
that
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
complete
escape
from
tax.
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
the
type
of
tax
involved
in
the
so-called
michigan
cases
recently
decided
by
this
court.
here,
the
tax
was
a
straight
ad
valorem
property
tax
levied
upon
the
property
of
the
united
states
enforceable
and
intended
to
be
enforced
to
the
lien
process
if
unpaid.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
whether
--
you
mean
as
distinguished
from
property
of
rfc?
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
of
the
corporation.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
that
is
correct,
sir.
there
is
a
crucial
point
here
gives
this
property
of
the
corporation
since
and
after
rfc,
by
its
own
voluntary
act,
executed
the
declaration
of
surplus.
and
we
have
to
examine
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
no,
none
of
which
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
no.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
possessory
interest.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
no.
that
has
been
stipulated.
as
i
was
pointing
out
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
--
that
throughout
this
case,
there
has
been
stipulated
that
there
may
--
maybe
retained
by
local
tax
authorities.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
yes.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
those
--
that
statute
embrace
these
properties
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
--
after
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
--
rfc
has
declared
its
surplus
to
its
needs
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
--
and
transferred
it
to
war
assets.
that
is
the
question.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
transfer
here,
i
think
to
get
the
true
meaning
of,
you
have
to
determine
and
examine
the
consequences
which
flowed
from
the
execution
by
rfc
of
the
declaration
that
this
property
was
surplus
to
its
needs.
those
consequences
are
detailed
in
the
provisions
of
the
surplus
property
act
and
the
regulations
issued
by
the
surplus
property
board.
possessions,
control,
responsibility
for
repair
and
maintenance,
ability,
indeed
without
participation
of
rfc,
to
convey
to
others,
to
lease
to
others
full
dominion
and
control
and
as
one
court
after
another
have
said
that
bare
and
legal
title
only
remained
in
rfc
after
this
declaration.
that
is
what
i
mean
by
transfer,
and
that
is
what
the
congress
when
it
enacted
public
law
388
in
1955
expressly
identified
transfer
as
including
such
a
change
and
responsibility,
control
and
supervision
over
government
properties
as
would
flow
from
a
declaration
that
it
was
surplus
to
the
needs
of
a
government
corporation.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
we
think
it's
not
to
avoid
the
effects
of,
but
rather
to
identify
what
had
happened.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
in
--
for
recognition
of
the
consequences
which
flowed
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
--
from
the
court
of
claims
decision.
i
must
perforce
under
the
rules
of
this
court,
first,
to
address
myself,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
this
case
came
up
here
by
appeal.
jurisdiction
under
the
problems
in
the
way
this
case
arose
is
a
difficult
one.
it's
appellant's
position
that
there
has
here
been
drawn
the
question
of
validity
of
a
statute
of
a
state.
those
statutes
being,
the
statutes
under
which
taxes
are
levied
on
all
property
by
local
governments
within
california.
it
cannot
be
questioned
here
that
a
federal
question
has
been
raised
from
the
very
inception
of
this
case.
it
is
appellant's
contention
that
the
statute
has
applied
on
the
tax
resulting,
was
attacked
on
federal
grounds.
the
fact
that
we
are
seeking
recoupment
rather
resist
--
resisting
the
imposition
of
the
tax,
it
makes
no
difference.
we
point
to
the
court
the
case
of
beaver
county
and
allegheny
county,
all
of
which
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
that
there
is
here
as
in
both
beaver
county
and
in
the
county
of
allegheny
been
drawn
in
to
the
question
the
validity
of
a
tax,
the
argument
that
could
be
made
on
whether
in
attacking
to
that
tax,
we
are
attacking
the
statute
under
which
it
was
levied
for
merely
the
tax.
it
seems
to
be
detailing
with
the
distinctions
which
have
no
realism.
in
the
last
analysis,
the
statute
has
in
existence
and
purpose
only
insofar
as
the
results
of
the
levy.
we
are
attacking
that
levy
and
in
so
doing
must
perforce
to
be
attacking
the
statute.
be
that
as
it
may,
it
is
appellant's
position
here
that
the
issues
of
this
case
clearly
demonstrated
that
it
is
one
which
presents
a
very
substantial
federal
question.
one
that
has
wider
application
than
might
have
first
appeared
and
one
which
has
been
decided
by
the
court
below
in
a
manner
probably
not
in
the
court
with
other
decisions
of
this
court,
as
we
shall
point
out
in
an
argument.
and
that
appeal
lies
or
if
not
this
court
as
admonished
by
the
statute,
we
should
take
the
papers
as
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
grant
certiorari.
i
think
this,
when
we
come
down
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
either
this
court
wants
to
hear
it
on
the
merits
before
it
does.
it
has
the
mechanics
in
either
one.
(inaudible)
to
you
that
it's
a
case
which
should
be
heard
on
the
merits
to
resolve
a
conflict
which
exist
between
the
court
of
claims,
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
and
there
are
other
cases
as
will
be
discussed
by
the
government
which
--
with
which
the
government
is
presently
concerned.
we
see
then
that
under
the
surplus
property
act,
it
is
--
it
has
been
provided
a
complete
mechanics
by
which
property
owned
by
the
government
corporation
is
administered,
used,
cared
for,
controlled,
sold,
leased
and
in
deed.
the
proceeds
from
leasing
whole
sale
do
not
go
back
to
our
suit,
if
having
declared
the
property
surplus.
they
are
covered
into
the
general
treasury
of
the
united
states.
if
something
happened
to
the
property
during
it's
controlled
by
war
assets,
that
risk
of
lost
lives
not
for
--
on
rfc
but
on
the
united
states.
it
is
our
position
that
the
congress
in
enacting
the
surplus
property
act
was
utilizing
the
powers
expressly
conferred
upon
it
by
the
constitution
that
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
dispose
of
and
make
all
read
for
rules
and
regulations
respect
to
the
territory
or
other
property
belonging
to
the
united
states.
in
furtherance
to
that
power,
the
congress
enacted
the
surplus
property
act.
after
that
enactment,
reconstruction
finance
corporation
by
its
own
voluntary
act
executed
a
document
which
under
the
framework
of
the
surplus
property
act
transferred
out
of
rfc
all
incidence
and
all
intendments
of
ownership.
indeed,
there
was
no
deed
in
a
formal
sense
of
the
word
on
any
of
the
property
of
the
defense
plant
corporation.
this
property,
bear
in
mind,
was
acquired
by
the
defense
plant
corporation
by
a
joint
resolution
of
congress.
there
was
transfer
from
the
defense
plant
corporation
to
rfc
all
property
of
the
defense
plant
corporation.
no
deed
was
ever
executed
by
defense
plant
corporation
to
rfc
covering
any
items
of
property.
all
of
this
was
accomplished
by
the
joint
resolution
of
congress.
here,
the
administrator
of
war
assets,
after
this
declaration,
could,
by
his
owner
act,
give
and
execute
a
conveyance
without
participation
in
any
degree
of
reconstruction
finance
corporation.
i
should
like,
if
i
might,
to
reserve
a
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
but
before
closing,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
a
statement
made
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
detroit-murray
cases
on
the
question
of
intergovernmental
submission
to
taxation.
since
intergovernmental
submission
to
taxation
is
primarily
a
problem
of
finance
and
legislation,
it
is
immaterial
that
contracts
by
government
have
been
purposefully
drawn
so
as
to
vest
title
to
the
property
that
is
subject
to
the
tax
in
the
government
and
thereby
withdrawn
from
the
taxing
power
of
the
states.
we
feel
that
this
is
so
here.
now,
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
true
ownership
of
the
property,
not
the
fact
that
for
chance,
no
deed
was
executed
or
none
was
necessary.
there
was
a
complete
and
effectual
transfer
out
of
rfc
to
war
assets
and
there
was
no
waiver
with
respect
to
property
of
the
united
states.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
may
i
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
--
members
of
the
court,
with
your
permission.
but
briefly
cover
a
few
other
points
which
have
been
raised
by
appellees,
first,
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
this
is
a
question
which
frankly
has
troubled
me
as
one
coming
before
you
to
seek
the
proper
remedy.
i
was
puzzled
by
two
cases
which
are
cited
and
referred
to
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief.
they
are
old
ones
but
they
eliminate
--
eliminate
the
problem
for
us.
one
is
the
indian
territory
illuminating
oil
company
and
the
other
jaybird
mining
company
against
weir.
at
least
these
two
cases
are
remarkable
because
they
arose
within
a
remarkably
short
time
with
each
other.
in
the
illuminating
oil
company,
oils
were
withdrawn
from
indian
lands
in
oklahoma
and
had
been
mingled
with
other
quarreled
concededly
taxable.
and
this
case
arose
under
the
early
concept
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
when
anything
that
was
taken
from
the
government
by
a
private
contractor,
was
covered
with
the
governmental
immunity.
in
the
jaybird
case,
we
had
ore
which
was
mined
on
indian
lands
and
in
the
bin
on
the
tax
tally.
in
both
cases,
the
same
statutes
of
oklahoma
were
involved.
in
both
cases,
the
same
assessment
procedures
and
levying
those
taxes
were
involved.
in
both
cases,
the
same
frame
of
immunity
was
raised
and
yet,
in
the
jaybird
case,
the
writ
of
error
or
an
appeal
was
allowed
while
in
the
indian
territory
case.
the
appeal
was
dismissed,
although
the
court
granted
certiorari.
here,
as
in
wilson
versus
cook,
how
do
we
distinguish
an
attack
on
statute
which
counsel
says
we
must
from
an
attack
upon
a
tax
which
is
the
product
of
the
statute?
i
think
that
an
explanation
of
wilson
against
cook
is
the
statement
of
court
which
is
contained
on
page
4
of
our
reply
brief.
as
the
record
does
not
show,
the
plaintiffs
presented
for
decision
to
the
state
supreme
court
any
federal
question.
they
have
no
appeal
to
this
court.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
opinion
of
a
district
court
of
appeal,
which
appears
both
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
in
our
opening
brief.
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
that
opinion
appears
and
attempted
to
be,
and
i
am
referring
expressly
to
page
28,
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
the
fourth
appellate
district.
appellant
contends
that
the
taxes
in
question
were
illegal
and
void
under
the
general
--
the
rule
that
lands
on
by
the
united
states
of
america
or
its
corporate
instrumentalities
are
immune
from
state
or
local
taxes
cited
mcculloch
against
maryland
and
other
cases.
this
question
was
also
raised
in
the
pleadings.
it
was
expressly
recognized
in
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
trial
court.
all
of
which
are
in
the
record.
but
so
much
for
this,
i
think
the
claim
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
under
some
of
the
language
which
this
court
has
used
in
dealing
with
other
cases,
a
close
one.
i
think
it
equally
claim
that
this
does
present
a
substantial
federal
question
which
has
not
heretofore
been
resolved
by
this
court.
and
certainly,
one
on
which
a
guidance
it
needs.
counsel
has
laid
to
execrable
stress
upon
administrative
policy,
a
policy
adopted
by
the
administrator
of
war
asset,
mr.
larson.
it's
interesting
to
note
however
that
this
policy
is
one
which
mr.
larson
abandoned
and
counsel
is
here
urging
that
an
abandoned
policy
be
adopted
as
a
rule
of
this
court
on
a
theory
that
administrative
policy,
an
interpretation
that's
been
long
in
effect
serves
as
a
guide
for
statutory
interpretation.
true,
this
is
the
--
the
rule
but
it
involves
a
--
an
administrative
policy
which
has
long
been
in
effect
and
which
has
been
followed.
this
can
then
become
a
guide.
but
certainly,
no
such
administrative
policy
has
here
been
shown
by
a
mere
statement
in
a
letter
from
mr.
larson
that
he
used
to
do
it
this
way
but
he
stopped
doing
in
that
way.
counsel
has
a
statement
that
it
is
rohr
aircraft
that
has
been
taxed.
this
statement
is
not
so
find.
the
entire
record
demonstrates
that
the
tax
filled
the
assessments,
the
levies
were
made
upon
property
of
the
united
states
and
upon
that
property,
not
upon
rohr
aircraft.
tax
bills
were
issued
in
the
name
of
reconstruction
finance
corporation.
they
were
sent
and
it
is
demonstrated
by
testimony
in
the
record.
presumably,
to
general
services
administration,
at
least
the
lessee
got
from
gsa
during
the
tax
years
here
involved,
they
were
forwarded
to
the
lessee
from
gsa
along
with
the
request
that
they
be
paid
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
lease.
this,
they
worked.
but
these
taxes
are
ad
valorem
taxes
levied
upon
property
of
the
united
states
drew.
it
may
be
a
property
of
one
its
governmental
instrumentalities
but
it's
nonetheless
property
of
the
united
states.
and
it
subjects
the
property
of
the
united
states
to
seizure,
to
levy
in
the
event
the
rohr
aircraft
corporation
did
not
comply
with
the
provisions
of
its
lease.
what
would
happen?
these
properties
of
the
united
states
would
have
been
sold
under
the
mechanics
provided
by
the
revenue
and
taxation
code
where
the
seizure
in
sale
of
delinquent
taxes.
they
could
have
been.
mr.
leroy
a.
wright
i
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
waiver.
the
property
--
any
property
owned
by
the
united
states
or
by
the
united
states
to
any
of
its
corporate
instrumentalities
with
respect
to
which
there
has
been
no
waiver
and
if
the
waiver
is
not
applicable,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
general
law
which
had
been
recognized
takes
with
it
the
constitutional
immunity
of
the
federal
government
from
a
tax
which
is
levied
upon
the
property
as
such.
to
distinguish
the
taxes,
which
were
involved
in
the
detroit
and
murray
case
which
were
levied
upon
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
lessee,
the
privilege
tax,
this
tax
is
not
such
a
case.
this
tax
is
levied
upon
the
property
of
the
united
states.
if
it's
permitted,
it's
permitted
at
all
solely
because
the
congress
has
waived
its
immunity
and
that
waiver
is
still
applicable.
we
contend
that
after
the
declaration
of
surplus,
waiver
is
no
longer
applicable
that
it
seizes
then
to
be
property
of
the
rfc.
just
the
same
as
though,
for
example,
a
similar
language
is
contained
in
the
statute
creating
the
federal
farm
mortgage
corporation.
suppose
the
congress
transferred
the
activities
and
functions
of
the
federal
farm
mortgage
corporation
to
the
department
of
agriculture
by
legislative
enactment,
what
would
happen
to
the
waiver?
we
contend
that
it
would
fall.
comment
has
been
here
made,
again,
that
rohr
is
being
taxed,
the
appellant
is
here
being
taxed.
this
ignores
the
fact
as
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
that
california
has
a
very
specific
and
express
system
for
the
taxation
of
possessory
interest
in
tax
and
in
properties.
we
make
no
complaint
about
that
tax.
that
is
a
tax
which
has
been
set
up
by
the
stipulations
entered
into
in
the
court
below
as
an
equitable
concept
of
any
recovery
which
we
might
obtain
here
if
our
contention
is
sustained.
but
that
is
a
tax
which
would
put
us
in
a
power
with
other
lessees
of
other
exempt
properties
within
the
state
of
california.
this
tax
is
levied
upon
the
government's
property
as
a
tax
upon
that
property
and
not
upon
this
lessee.
this
court
has
stated
in
recent
cases
that
a
state
may
not
constitutionally
taxed
property
owned
by
the
federal
government
even
though
the
property
is
in
private
hands
and
the
taxes
to
be
collected
upon
the
private
taxpayer.
that
statement
and
that
language
is
called
from
this
court's
various
opinions
in
the
michigan
cases
recently
decided.
and
we
believe
that
here,
the
state
has
been
attempted
to
constitutionally
tax
property
(inaudible)
by
the
united
states.
we,
therefore,
submit
that
the
case
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
