justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
--
what
was
done
in
this
case
different
from
other?
i
suppose
the
rfc
has
turned
over
other
properties,
do
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
actually
this
municipality
didn't
get
that
to
hand
out,
did
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
property
went
back
ultimately,
as
i
understand
it.
it
was
leased
again
by
the
war
assets
administration
to
the
petitioner.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
have
any
connection
with
the
withholding
of
the
deed?
