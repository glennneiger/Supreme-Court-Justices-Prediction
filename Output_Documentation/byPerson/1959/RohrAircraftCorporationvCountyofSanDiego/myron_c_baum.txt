mr.
myron
c.
baum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
phrase
the
issue
just
likely
differently.
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
the
absence
of
a
deed
from
the
rfc
to
the
united
states
was
the
event
which
made
this
property
taxable
by
the
state
of
california
or
the
county
of
san
diego.
the
appellees
admit
that
this
is
the
only
issue
for
they
state
in
their
brief
that
if
a
deed
had
been
executed,
they
would
not
contest
the
immunity
of
this
property
from
local
taxation.
so
as
i
say,
in
phrasing
the
question,
we
focus
immediately
upon
the
sole
and
single
issue
was
a
deed
required
in
order
to
render
this
property
no
longer
property
of
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation.
and
i
submit
that
i
can
show
to
the
court
very
briefly
that
the
statutes
involved
as
well
decisions
which
we
rely
on
make
it
plain
that
no
deed
was
required.
as
counsel
has
already
pointed
out,
section
8
of
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
act
of
1932
provided
for
the
exception
of
property
of
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
from
state
and
local
taxation
but
it
saves
from
that
exemption
real
property
and
made
it
expressly
subject
to
such
taxation.
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
the
reason
for
that
subjection
of
real
property
of
rfc,
the
local
taxation
was
that
in
1930s,
the
rfc
was
engaged
in
essentially
commercial
activity.
we
submit
here
that
once
this
property
was
no
longer
being
used
for
any
form
of
commercial
or
industrial
activity
of
rfc
but
had
been
declared
surplus
and
was
transferred
to
another
agency
of
the
government
to
fulfill
regular
governmental
purposes,
that
the
reason
for
this
so-called
waiver
of
immunity
collapsed.
this
is
made
patently
obvious
when
we
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944.
that
act
provides
that
the
owning
agency,
in
this
case
the
rfc,
may
declare
property
surplus
when
it
determines
that
it
is
surplus
to
its
needs.
that
is
not
some
oral
statement,
it
is
a
formal
declaration,
a
copy
of
it
is
printed
in
the
record
before
your
honors.
upon
that
declaration
of
surplus,
the
war
assets
administration
took
over
the
property.
it
took
it
over
in
this
case
in
the
sense
of
utilizing
it
for
a
storage
depot.
by
statute,
it
was
given
the
duty
of
caring
for
and
handling
the
property
to
control
it's
disposal
to
dispose
of
it
by
sale,
lease,
exchange
or
transfer
and
under
section
15
(b)
of
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944,
the
war
assets
administration
was
expressly
empowered
by
congress
to
execute
any
documents
of
title
which
were
necessary
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
a
deed
was
necessary
to
transfer
title
to
this
property
from
the
rfc
to
the
united
states
or
to
the
war
assets
administration,
it
could
not
have
been
empowered
to
execute
a
deed
to
a
purchaser
whereas
congress
has
expressly
said
that
by
statute,
that
--
the
war
assets
administration
may
execute
such
a
deed.
the
same
result
follows
if
we
look
at
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
of
1949
which
repeal
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944.
in
that
act,
we
are
now
dealing
with
the
general
services
administrator
who
succeeded
to
the
war
assets
administration.
he
is
given
supervision,
direction
over
disposition
of
surplus
property,
the
care
and
handling.
and
any
agency
authorized
by
the
general
service
--
general
services
administrator
to
dispose
of
surplus
property
may
do
so
by
sale,
exchange,
lease
or
transfer
and
may
execute
a
deed.
here
again,
we
have
an
expressed
statutory
provision
for
a
deed
to
be
executed
where
if
we
follow
appellees
reasoning
in
that
of
the
court
below,
there
has
been
a
gap
in
the
chain
of
title.
obviously,
no
gap
exists.
finally,
we
come
to
the
statute
referred
to
as
public
law
388
which
was
a
1955
amendment
to
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act.
that
was
adverted
to
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
a
moment
ago.
that
act,
however,
was
not
a
recognition
or
an
avoidance
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims.
that
act
made
provision
for
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
to
the
locality
because
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
and
of
the
comptroller
general
of
the
united
states,
these
properties
had
been
rendered
non-taxable.
and
so
it
was
provided
that
congress
would
voluntarily
make
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
in
order
to
alleviate
the
hardships
which
would
be
imposed.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
indicates
that
congress
far
from
repudiating
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
or
of
the
comptroller
general
was
giving
express
recognition
to
it
and
was
recognizing
that
something
had
to
be
done.
and
so
what
it
did
was,
as
the
committee
reports
themselves
state,
it
may
temporary
provision
for
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
and
congressman
meader,
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
himself,
said
this
is
not
taxation.
this
or
these
are
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes.
so
if
we
have
any
indication
of
what
congress
thought
of
this
in
terms
of
expressed
legislation,
we
have
it
there.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
this
municipality
did
for
the
year
1955
and
that's
the
statute
begin,
it
comes
effective
in
1955.
we
are
here
dealing
with
tax
years
preceding
1955
and
that
is
why
1955
is
no
longer
before
us.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that
is
true.
and
even
more
significantly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
at
the
end
of
the
committee
report
of
the
house
committee
on
government
operations
which
reported
this
bill,
that's
house
report
number
1453,
i
regret
that
this
report
came
to
our
attention
after
the
brief
was
written
and
so
it
is
not
cited.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
number
1453,
84th
congress,
first
session
house
report.
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
the
senate
report
is
a
direct
quotation
of
the
house
report.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
84th
congress,
first
session,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
84th.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
1453.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
at
the
end
of
that
report,
there
appears
a
table
which
has
the
following
caption
at
the
top,
"properties
on
which
payments
would
be
made
if
the
legislation
were
enacted,"
and
item
5
on
that
table
is
rohr
aircraft
chula
vista.
if
we
need
anymore
demonstration
as
to
what
was
intended
here,
here
is
congress
itself
saying
that
we
need
this
legislation
in
order
to
make
payments
to
the
localities
and
chula
vista
in
the
county
of
san
diego
and
we
do
it
through
this
legislation.
this
is
legislation
which
is
in
lieu
of
taxes
and
not
a
--
a
subjection
to
taxation.
in
fact,
the
report
goes
on
and
it
says,
"because
of
a
ruling
by
the
united
states
court
of
claims
in
1952
and
a
subsequent
ruling
by
the
comptroller
general
in
the
same
year,
certain
real
properties
that
had
formally
been
subject
to
local
taxation
have
now
been
rendered
non-taxable
by
the
local
authorities."
and
then
comes
this
illuminating
sentence,
"this
is
true
whether
complete
legal
title
to
real
property
has
been
transferred
from
a
government
corporation
to
another
government
department
or
whether
the
government
corporation
retained
legal
title
and
transfers
custody,
control
or
accountability
for
the
real
property
to
another
government
department."
and
then
it
goes
on
--
it's
a
--
three
sentences
later
and
says,
“it
therefore
appeared
just
and
necessary.”
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes,
sure,
certainly.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
well,
in
saying
this
is
true.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
you
can
interpret
that
either
way,
i
think,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
think
--
i
--
i
construe
it
in
saying
the
committee
is
recognizing
its
truth
as
well.
and
i
think
that
is
--
it
--
illustrated
by
the
sentence
i
was
about
to
read
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
--
which
says,
“it
therefore
appeared
just
and
necessary
that
provisions
be
made
as
in
this
bill
at
least
on
a
temporary
basis
to
make
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
until
a
comprehensive
policy
with
regard
to
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
shall
have
been
enacted
by
the
congress.”
in
fact,
congressman
meader's
statement
is
to
the
same
effect.
he
says,
“but
my
bill
does
not
subject
the
federal
--
federal
government
to
taxation
but
provides
for
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
voluntarily
undertaken
by
the
federal
government
subject
to
repeal
by
the
federal
government
at
any
time
and
thus,
it
would
seem
to
me
to
avoid
any
difficulty
about
one
unit
of
government
taxing
another."
mr.
myron
c.
baum
certainly,
sir.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
as
far
as
i'm
informed
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
no,
your
honor.
as
far
as
i
am
informed,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
those
transfers
are
in
effect
transferred
by
the
necessary
operation
of
law,
for
example
here,
as
the
counsel
said,
this
was
--
this
property
--
the
title
to
this
property
was
held
by
defense
plant
corporation.
defense
plant
corporation
was
dissolved
and
was
--
and
its
property
was
taken
over
by
rfc.
it
became
property
of
rfc.
in
fact,
the
court
below
relies
on
legal
title
in
rfc
yet
there
was
no
deed.
it
was
transferred
from
war
assets
to
general
services
administrator,
again
no
deed.
property
has
been
transferred
by
various
government
agency,
either
by
reorganization
plans,
executive
orders
or
as
a
result
of
statutes
transferring
functions
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
--
and
it
has
never
been
transferred.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
routine
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
routine
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
there
are
seldom
deeds
and
it
is
a
source
of
some
concern
to
us
that
a
deed
is
being
insisted
upon
in
this
case
to
have
legal
effect
in
performing
the
governmental
function
here
involved.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
true
government
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
assume
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
the
tax
bills
were
sent
to
the
rfc
during
the
years
in
question.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
couldn't
be
wholly
certain.
and
i
would
have
to
defer
to
counsel
on
that
but
i
believe
that's
true
or
probably
in
defense
plant
corporation.
i
believe
that's
the
last
record
of
transfer.
this
property
was
formally
owned
by
the
predecessor
of
this
rohr
aircraft
corporation
and
was
transferred
by
it
to
defense
plant
corporation.
that's
the
last
transfer
on
record
until
as
i'm
advised
recently
which
is
not
in
the
record
here,
rohr
aircraft
has
since
purchased
its
property
after
the
years
in
--
in
suit.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
come
to
this
problem
of
why
someone
thought
that
a
deed
was
necessary
just
at
the
moment.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
to
--
none
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
coming
to
this
question
of
a
deed,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
as
the
court
seems
to
be
aware,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
in
board
of
county
commissioners
versus
sedgwick
county
which
involved
an
exact,
exactly
similar
factual
pattern
in
which
the
court
of
claims
came
to
the
conclusion
correctly,
we
think,
that
no
deed
was
necessary,
the
title,
beneficial
title
was
in
the
united
states
and
the
property
was
not
taxable
by
the
state
of
kansas
in
that
case
or
the
county
of
sedgwick
in
kansas.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
very
illuminating
feature
of
the
board
of
county
commissioners
case,
which
does
not
appear
from
the
quotations
normally
found,
that
there,
as
in
this
case,
somebody
thought
that
a
deed
had
better
be
executed
to
clear
up
the
chain
of
title.
and
i
think
it
is
a
source
of
some
remarkable
surprise.
this
--
i
am
not
going
into
the
record
in
this
case.
this
appears
in
the
opinion
as
officially
reported
that
the
deed
executed
to
the
united
states
in
that
case
was
executed
by
the
war
assets
administrator.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
comes
full
circle.
we
have
the
owning
agency
never
--
never
executing
a
deed,
never,
according
to
the
law
of
conveyancing
at
least,
divesting
itself
of
title
but
the
--
the
transferee
agency,
the
war
assets
administrator
executes
a
deed
to
the
united
states
which
renders
the
whole
business
of
a
deed
to
me
meaningless.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
have
no
idea
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
--
who
receive
the
deed,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
doubt
it
very
much.
i
assumed
it
was
given
to
the
war
assets
administrator
himself
and
ultimately
to
the
general
services
administrator.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
it
was
not
property
in
the
district,
it
was
property
in
kansas.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
assume
it
was
sent
out
for
recording.
i
was
just
relying
on
what
i
read
from
the
opinion
that
--
it
seems
to
me
to
illustrate
the
whole
mockery
of
the
emphasis
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
--
on
a
deed.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
think
the
united
states
is
subject
to
local
[laughs]
registration
fee
in
that
case.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes,
it
does.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
didn't
hear
your,
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
agency
involved
in
the
--
in
the
handling
of
the
property
receives
the
deed
but
it's
the
property
is
sometimes
held
directly
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
it
could
be
done.
but
that's
what
happened
in
that
case.
he
was
almost
executing
a
deed
to
himself.
now,
much
is
made
of
the
fact.
oh,
in
that
case,
counsel
has
drawn
my
attention
to
the
board
of
county
commissioners.
the
property
was
transferred
to
the
department
of
the
air
force
so
presumably,
the
deed
went
to
the
air
force
instead
of
--
to
the
--
that
is
--
the
deed
was
to
the
united
states
but
physically
may
have
been
delivered
to
the
air
force
instead
of
some
other
agency.
but
i
think
that's
all
irrelevant.
much
is
sought
to
be
made
of
the
fact.
it's
made
by
the
court
below,
and
it's
made
much
here
by
appellees.
the
fact
that
mr.
larson,
the
one
time
general
services
administrator,
stated
before
a
congress
--
congressional
committee
that
he
had
withheld
execution
of
deeds
because
he
was
of
the
belief
that
by
failing
to
execute
a
deed,
the
property
would
remain
taxable,
and
they
didn't
want
to
disturb
these
localities
by
taking
these
properties
off
the
tax
rolls
in
a
--
in
--
all
of
a
sudden
and
therefore,
disrupting
their
sources
of
revenues.
frankly,
the
best
i
can
say
to
--
to
what
mr.
larson
said
is
what
he
said
himself.
he
said,
“i
was
wrong.”
mr.
larson,
as
general
services
administrator,
was
in
no
position
to
interpret
the
law
of
the
united
states
as
congress
has
enacted
it.
this
is
not
a
case
as
we
have
referred
for
several
hours
in
the
cases
preceding
where
the
administrator
concerned
is
empowered
to
issue
regulations
to
interpret
the
statute.
here,
we
have
statutes
would
say
which
property
may
be
taxable
on
which
property
may
not
be
or
rather
the
constitution
which
says
which
property
may
not
be
taxed.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that
--
the
whole
explanation,
i
think,
if
--
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
he
was
of
the
belief
that
he
should
--
he
is
--
he
is
the
impact
so
to
speak.
and
of
course,
the
deeds,
the
execution
of
deeds
were
executed
at
various
times.
now,
in
board
of
county
commissioners,
the
deed
was
executed
one
year
after
the
declaration
of
surplus.
in
this
case,
it
was
not
executed
until
nine
years
later.
in
other
cases,
it
runs
for
other
periods
of
years
without
any
rhyme
or
reason.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
deed
was
not
even
executed
until
the
very
same
year
when
congress
was
making
provision
for
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
no,
your
honor.
that
had
no
connection
whatever.
the
only
significance
to
that
fact
has
is
that
it
serves
to
demonstrate,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
case,
if
anything
is
likely
an
a
--
a
fortiori
situation
to
that
presented
in
board
of
county
commissioners
because
as
the
court
below
sought
to
say
in
board
of
county
commissioners,
the
lessee
remained
continuously
in
possession
during
this
surplus
declaration
for
process
whereas
here,
the
lessee
vacated
the
premises.
it
was
used
by
the
government
itself
for
two
years
and
then
was
again
leased
to
the
former
lessee
all
over
again
under
a
five-year
lease.
now,
it
is
a
basic
fact
which
we
cannot
escape
that
in
tax
law,
and
we
have
cited
numerous
decisions
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
levy
the
tax
according
to
the
incidence
of
bare
and
legal
title.
and
the
most
that
can
be
said
here
is
that
the
rfc
retained
bear
and
legal
type.
i
doubt
if
that
can
even
be
justified
in
view
of
the
statute
which
i
have
referred
to.
i
think
that
legal
title
had
passed
to
the
united
states
by
the
declaration
of
surplus
because
the
transferer
--
transferee
agency
had
all
the
powers
of
ownership
including
the
power
to
execute
a
deed
to
a
private
person
or
whom
you're
with.
and
in
similar
situations,
that
result
has
been
followed.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
it's
--
they
look
to
the
beneficial
ownership.
we
have
had
cases
which
i
have
referred
to
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
black,
where
the
united
states
had
retained
a
bare
legal
title
and
in
claim
of
immunity
was
asserted.
for
example,
there's
one
case
where
a
--
the
land
patent
had
not
yet
been
delivered
and
the
courts
held
that
that
was
of
no
significance
that
the
private
person
had
all
incidence
of
beneficial
ownership
and
therefore,
the
property
was
not
immune
from
state
and
local
taxation.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
meant
in
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
was
--
i
was
--
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
finish
my
sentence,
i
should
have
said
bare
legal
title
as
opposed
to
the
person
holding
the
beneficial
ownership,
that
is
immunity
does
not
rest
on
any
concept
of
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes.
in
continental
motors
versus
township
of
muskegon,
which
is
a
decision
in
the
court
with
the
decision
below.
we
have
exactly
the
same
reasoning
as
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
california.
they
relied
on
the
statement
of
--
of
general
services
administrator
larson
that
the
property
was
not
to
be
removed
from
the
tax
rolls
and
they
said
that's
the
result
we
should
reach.
but
it
is
not
the
result
which
should
be
reached
in
accordance
with
law
as
mr.
larson
himself
recognized.
in
fact,
the
ridiculous
absurdity
to
which
this
decision
has
led
is
illustrated
by
a
case
now
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
referred
to
in
our
brief
under
the
name
of
united
states
versus
county
of
lawrence.
that
case
also
involved
the
disposal
of
surplus
property.
and
in
that
case
the
court,
the
district
court
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
has
held
that
even
though
a
deed
has
been
delivered,
the
property
remains
taxable
to
the
rfc.
so
we
are
taking
this
one
step
at
a
time
until
we
find
that
once
congress
has
enacted
a
waiver
of
immunity
with
respect
to
rfc
property,
it
seems
to
attach
to
the
property
forever
and
can
never
be
removed.
that
certainly
is
not
a
result
which
is
in
accordance
with
logic
and
reason.
i
think
the
error
of
all
these
decisions
in
continental
and
in
county
of
lawrence
and
at
the
court
below
is
that
it
fails
to
recognize
that
this
property
has
been
effectively
removed
from
the
control,
custody,
operation,
responsibility
of
rfc.
it
is
now
fully
under
the
control
of
the
united
states.
and
that
even
if
it
be
held
that
bare
and
legal
title
has
some
significance
in
this
context,
taxation
should
not
be
held
dependant
upon.
the
decision
below
failed
to
recognize
that
the
waiver
of
immunity
from
local
taxation
enacted
by
congress
in
1932
with
respect
to
property
of
rfc,
has
lost
all
reason
for
existence
as
applied
to
this
property
which
has
become
intermingled
with
general
property
of
the
united
states
to
be
disposed
of
as
part
of
the
surplus
property
disposal
program.
upon
such
transfer
to
a
disposal
agency
and
upon
such
intermingling
of
the
property
with
other
property
of
the
united
states,
it
should
be
treated
in
the
same
fashion.
the
waiver
of
immunity
enacted
by
congress
falls
and
the
governmental
immunity
regularly
attaching
to
real
property
of
the
united
states
becomes
applicable.
for
these
reasons,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
