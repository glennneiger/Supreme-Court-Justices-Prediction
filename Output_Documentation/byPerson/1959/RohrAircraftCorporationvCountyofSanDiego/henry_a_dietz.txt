first,
might
i
state
that
i
regret
very
much
that
the
chief
trial
deputy
in
county
counsel
of
san
diego
county
did
not
or
is
not
able
to
be
here
to
argue
his
own
case.
he
tried
this
matter
from
the
trial
courts
through
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
and
unforeseeably,
he
had
a
heart
attack
and
has
had
to
retire.
so,
in
effect,
i
am
pinch-hitting
for
him.
i
hope
i
will
be
able
to
do
him
justice.
we
have
some
rather
interesting
questions
here
with
respect
to
passage
of
title
and
with
respect
to
whether
a
deed
is
needed
and
whether
this
is
a
question
that
should
be
determined
of
this
issue.
the
supreme
court
of
california
expressed
itself
as
this
is
being
the
sole
question,
whether
the
land
seized
to
be
real
property
of
the
rfc
when
control
and
responsibility
was
subsequently
transferred
to
the
war
assets
administration.
michigan,
on
the
other
hand,
expresses
the
question
as
being
in
the
final
analysis
the
question
at
issue
was
whether
congress
clearly
manifested
an
intent
in
the
enactment
of
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944
or
otherwise
that
property
of
the
rfc
declared
surplus
without
a
transfer
of
the
legal
title
should
thereupon
become
immune
from
taxation,
not
withstanding,
the
waiver
in
the
act
creating
said
corporation.
the
first
point
that
i
wish
to
make
is
that
we
are
attempting
to
determine
this
question
on
a
matter
of
what
was
the
intent
of
congress.
in
1932,
when
the
original
act
was
passed,
a
provision
stated
any
real
property
of
the
corporation,
any
real
property
of
the
corporation
indicating
a
predecessor
to
rfc
shall
be
subject
to
state,
territorial,
county,
municipal
or
local
taxation
to
the
same
extent
and
according
to
its
value
as
other
real
property.
here,
we
have
an
expressed
waiver
of
immunity
but
not
only
that,
we
have
an
expressed
consent
for
the
state
to
tax
as
such.
it's
not
merely
aware
of
immunity
but
a
statement
that
the
state
shall
tax.
these
taxes
have
to
do
with
the
years
1951
to
1952,
fiscal
years
through
1954,
1955.
the
taxes
in
this
case
are
not
particularly
in
dispute,
and
i
think
that
we
are
faced
with
three
separate
cases
which
involved
the
identical
issue
or
the
identical
principle.
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
recall,
and
i'm
sorry
that
i
can't
prove
to
you
by
a
way
of
the
record
which
is
before
you,
it
is
my
understanding
that
rfc
is,
at
the
present
time,
the
record
owner
of
this
property
on
the
tax
rolls
of
the
county
of
san
diego.
now,
let's
go
in
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
this
so-called
waiver
or
giving
this
expressed
consent
to
tax.
it
was
done
for
one
purpose
only,
and
i
think
that
it
generally
recognized
and
that
was
during
the
depression
years
that
there
were
properties
being
transferred
and
difficulties
going
on
with
respect
to
taxes
to
the
extent
that
local
taxation
was
in
really
a
pretty
sad
situation
if
it
was
going
to
be
necessary
for
the
government
to
take
over
various
properties,
and
also
to
take
care
of
that
situation
of
the
need
for
the
local
communities
to
be
able
to
run
themselves
by
the
use
of
taxes.
in
1944,
when
the
so-called
surplus
property
act
was
passed,
the
--
i'm
trying
to
find
the
exact
statement
as
to
what
was
said
in
the
preamble
of
the
1944
(inaudible)
congress,
after
the
determination
by
the
court
of
claims
and
after
the
determination
by
the
comptroller
general
in
his
opinion,
came
to
the
conclusion
in
section
701
and
stated
that
a
declaration
of
policy
was
this,
"the
congress
recognizes
that
the
transfer
of
real
property
having
a
taxable
status
from
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
or
any
of
its
subsidiaries
to
another
government
department
is
often
operated
to
remove
such
property
from
the
tax
rolls
of
states
and
local
taxing
authorities,
thereby
creating
an
undue
and
an
unexpected
burden
upon
such
states
and
local
taxing
authorities
and
causing
disruption
of
their
operations.
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
title
to
furnish
temporary
measures
of
relive
for
such
states
and
local
taxing
authorities
by
providing
that
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
shall
be
made
with
respect
to
the
real
property
so
transferred
on
or
after
january
1st,
1946."
apparent
to
that
time
and
for
a
period
of
eight
years
and
so
far
as
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
was
concerned
and
the
general
services
administration
was
concerned,
it
was
the
interpretation
of
the
administrative
agency
that
was
given
the
duty
of
handling
this
property
that
it
was
necessary
to
pass
a
deed
or
pass
a
title
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
there
should
be
an
immunity
from
taxation.
the
basic
reason
that
they
did
not
desire
to
tax
or
did
not
desire
to
transfer
title
on
these
cases
was
because
they
said
some
1500
plants
would
be
taken
off
of
the
local
tax
rolls.
likewise,
they
thought
that
they
were
interpreting
what
was
the
true
intent
of
congress
and
after
all,
this
honorable
court
is
to
determine
one
thing,
what
was
the
intent
of
congress
with
respect
to
taxability
insofar
as
local
communities
were
concerned
where
property
has
been
declared
surplus
and
where
it
has
been
accepted
by
war
assets
administration?
even
the
case
upon
which
counsel
so
heavily
relies,
the
sedgwick
county
case
is
very
cautious,
that
being
a
court
of
claims
case,
to
say
that
insofar
as
a
mere
declaration
of
surplus,
this
does
not
relieve
immunity.
it
is
necessary
that
there
be
an
acceptance
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
corporations.
but
what
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944?
was
it
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
a
property
and
relieving
itself
of
immunity
from
taxation,
which
is
granted
by
the
original
act?
or
was
it
for
the
purpose
of
orderly
transfer
of
properties
of
the
united
states
either
to
some
other
governmental
activity,
at
which
time
we
would
claim,
of
course,
there
would
be
no
tax
by
way
of
passage
of
legal
title
or
it
was
to
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
some
private
individual
whereby
would
again
be
placed
back
on
the
tax
rolls?
it
is
my
contention
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
that,
in
effect,
all
these
disposal
agencies
were
doing
was
to
dispose
of
property
for
the
purpose
of
an
orderly
disposition.
and
if
they
were
not
in
fact
the
owners
of
the
real
property
as
it's
indicated
in
the
original
statement
of
the
exemption
from
tax.
well,
let's
see
if
we
can
cover
this
point
with
respect
to
the
passage
of
a
deed.
there's
only
one
way
that
i
know
of
that
property
is
taxed
--
real
property
is
taxed
in
the
original
instance
in
a
state,
and
that
is
when
the
property
is
placed
upon
the
tax
rolls
as
such.
this
is
the
only
notification
that
they
have
and
under
--
under
revenue
and
taxation
code
611
of
our
state,
the
assessor
is
required.
it
is
a
mandatory
duty
upon
him
to
assess
property
to
the
record
owner,
the
legal
record
owner.
could
it
not
be
that
insofar
as
we
are
concern
that
this
particular
property
as
such
that
the
passage
of
title
or
the
indication
of
passage
of
title
on
those
records
of
the
local
authorities
who
had
been
given
the
power
of
tax
was
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
the
local
taxing
authorities
what
they
could
attack
or
what
they
could
tax?
it
might
well
be
that
we
should
consider
another
thing,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
even
in
the
beaver
county
case,
it
has
been
determined
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
courts
to
consider,
the
fact
that
there
will
be
a
great
disruption
of
the
--
of
the
taxing
authorities
in
particular
cases
if
it
is
not
considered
that
where
expressed
taxation
authority
is
given,
then
the
state
should
have
the
right
to
have
notice
of
it.
i
believe
that
i
have
covered
pretty
thoroughly
in
our
brief
the
various
questions
that
have
been
propounded
to
us.
we
are
going
very
definitely
upon
the
question
of
the
intent
of
congress.
i
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california,
in
its
expression
of
what
was
the
intent
of
congress,
the
intent
of
congress
being
not
to
disrupt
taxation
but
to
have
a
fair
share
passed
on
to
the
local
communities.
and
likewise,
of
--
this
one
factor,
which
i
think
should
be
particularly
known.
number
one,
rohr
aircraft's
predecessor
sold
this
property
to
the
federal
government
in
the
first
instance.
number
two,
it
again
went
back
in
to
possess
--
possession
in
1944.
number
three,
during
this
period
of
time,
it
was
required
by
the
federal
government
to
pay
the
tax
by
its
very
lease.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
federal
government
property
is
being
taxed,
rohr
aircraft
is
being
taxed
and
the
federal
government
has
recognized
it
by
a
way
of
a
lease.
it
has
stated
in
the
lease,
and
i
hope
i
can
find
it,
in
the
tax
provision
number
13,
"lessee
agrees
to
pay
to
the
proper
authority
when
and
as
the
same
becomes
due
and
payable,
all
taxes,
assessments
and
similar
charges
which
at
anytime
during
the
term
of
this
lease
maybe
taxed,
assessed
or
imposed
upon
a
lessor
or
a
lessee
with
respect
to
or
upon
the
leased
premises
and
personal
property,"
and
so
forth.
and
it
even
goes
to
the
extent
of
stating
that
in
the
event
a
lessee
fails
to
pay
when
due
any
taxes,
assessments,
utility
bills
or
similar
charges
is
about
set
forth
then
lessor
may,
at
its
option,
face
such
taxes,
assessments,
bills
or
other
charges
that
require
lessee
to
immediately
reimburse
it
for
such
cost
which
the
amount
is
hereby
declared
to
be
additional
rental
and
to
become
immediately
due
and
payable.
lessor
reserves
the
right
to
contest
the
validity
or
amount
of
any
tax
assessment
which,
of
course,
we
do
not
dispute.
in
view
of
this
fact
that
i
have
just
stated
that
this
tax
is
to
go
back
to
rohr
aircraft
and
not
to
the
federal
government,
they
now
seek
to
come
in
and
obtain
this
tax
back
for
the
purpose
of
their
own
profits
for
the
purpose
of
the
funds
going
in
to
their
coverage,
rightful
taxes
on
property,
and
if
rohr
owned
this
property,
it
would
be
so
taxed.
i
think,
perhaps,
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
go
further
in
this
case
with
exception
of
making
one
further
statement,
that
is,
that
the
lease
in
this
case
was
entered
into
by
reconstruction
finance
corporation
in
1949.
and
in
1954,
reconstruction
finance
corporation
by
and
through
general
services
administrator
made
an
additional
years
leased
on
this
same
property,
if
this
is
an
indicia
of
rfc
having
no
interest,
no
ability
or
no
control
over
this
property,
then
i
am
sadly
mistaken.
and
i
thank
you
extremely
for
your
wonderful
courtesy.
