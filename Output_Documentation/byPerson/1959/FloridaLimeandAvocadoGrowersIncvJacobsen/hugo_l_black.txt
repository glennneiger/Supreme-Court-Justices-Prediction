justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
have
you
cited
those
--
the
congressional
statement
that
you
just
made
to
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
not
quoted
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
that's
not
cited
in
your
brief,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
2
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
merely
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
johnson
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
side
did
you
take
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
whatnot,
i
didn't
quite
get
that
argument.
why
would
--
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
say
the
calling
was
voluntary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
--
do
they
claim
that
they
have
been
subject
to
having
their
fruit
wrongfully
reshipped
from
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
did
they
claim
they
reshipped
it
voluntarily?
because
they
wanted
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
to
take
a
risk,
they
shipped
it
out
of
the
state,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
would
hypothetical
and
contingent
if
they
knew
that
their
fruit
was
going
to
be
taken
and
examined
might
be
seized,
they
--
rather
than
go
--
have
that
done,
they
ship
it
out
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
it
the
state
officers
notified
and
they
had
it
submitted
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
it
they
notified
and
you
said
they
give
information
or
what
kind
of
notice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
what
kind
of
request
would
you
want?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
certainly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
long
as
they
let
it
stay
there,
why
they
can't
sell
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
this
was
a
violation
notice,
wasn't
it?
marked
violation
notice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he
had
then
was
a
notice
that
he
had
violated
the
law
and
he
didn't
do
something,
i
assume
that
nothing
that
he
does
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
he
let
him
come
and
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
supposed
they
had
seized
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
notice
doesn't
tell
not
on
the
country
those
on
that
--
that
mere
possession
is
an
unlawful
act,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
notice,
it
seems
to
me,
be
this,
if
you
don't
sign
this
paper
for
you
to
require
with
provisions
with
the
california
law
as,
they
say
is
unconstitutional,
something
they
have
to,
isn't
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
is
it?
is
it
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
had
to
take
it
out
of
the
state
i
guess
is
subjected
to
this
law,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
also
said,
i
hereby
agree
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
california
agricultural
code.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
then
is,
isn't
it,
the
abatement
of
a
salesman,
which
is
probably
there
in
the
violation
of
the
law
and
he
doesn't
take
it
out
of
the
state.
you're
going
after
to
him,
and
in
the
process,
you're
going
after
that
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
in
that
case
a
controversy?
i
don't
think
it
was
that
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
--
don't
you
think
it
would
have
occurred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
the
--
why
did
you
give
them
the
notice
for
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
referring
to
the
one
--
does
the
constitution
say,
does
the
constitution
as
the
law
say
that
should
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
we
--
