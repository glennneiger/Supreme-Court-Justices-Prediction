mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
heard
below
by
a
three-judge
district
court
on
the
motion
of
the
defendants
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
the
court
granted
the
motion
and
dismissed
the
complaint
for
alleged
want
of
jurisdiction.
the
court
held
that
the
record
fails
to
show
the
existence
of
a
justiciable
controversy
between
the
parties
within
the
meaning,
scope
of
the
judicial
power
conferred
on
the
federal
courts
by
the
united
states
constitution.
the
appellants
are
florida
corporations
engaged
in
the
interstate
marketing
of
avocados
grown
in
the
southern
part
of
florida.
they
complained
that
their
marketing
operations
are
restricted
and
handicapped
by
application
of
a
statute
of
california
prohibiting
sale
in
that
state
of
avocados
of
less
than
8%
oil
content
regardless
of
quality
or
maturity
by
any
other
standards
and
that
the
california
statute,
as
applied
to
their
marketing
of
avocados,
is
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
appellants
invoked
three
provisions
of
the
constitution,
the
commerce
clause,
because
the
challenged
state
statute
is
an
unwarranted,
impermissible
interference
with
interstate
commerce,
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
because
application
of
the
statute
to
appellants'
avocados
results
in
arbitrary
discrimination
against
appellants
in
favor
of
the
growers
and
handlers
of
avocados
grown
in
california
and
the
supremacy
clause,
because
appellants'
avocados
are
marketed
under
federal
regulation
and
in
compliance
with
the
standards
of
quality
and
maturity
thereby
imposed,
that
is,
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937
and
the
program
adopted
thereunder
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
with
specific
relation
to
the
avocados
grown
in
south
florida
and
because
application
of
the
california
statute
to
these
avocados
overrides
and
defeats
the
policy
and
program
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well,
the
--
the
--
your
--
your
question
relates
to
the
regulations.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
to
the
regulations.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
statute
itself
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
but
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that
is
the
essence
of
the
whole
program
in
this
--
in
this
particular
instance.
a
marketing
agreement
may
have
various
other
purposes
but
this
marketing
agreement
as
for
its
main
purpose,
the
fixing
of
standards
of
quality
and
maturity.
they
do
not
include
any
requirement
of
oil
content
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
with
respect
to
these
florida
avocados.
the
standard
is
stated
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
in
the
complaint
--
in
brief.
it
has
to
do
with
the
fixing
of
the
time
for
picking
of
the
avocados
in
coordination
with
the
attainment
of
certain
size
and
weight
at
a
given
date
when
the
picking
is
permitted.
that
has
been
the
practice
under
this
program
since
it
was
adopted
june
11,
1954.
and
i
--
i
say
again,
your
honor,
in
this
instance,
that
is
the
--
almost
the
entire
purpose
of
the
program
because
it
was
adopted
for
the
reason
that
there
was
no
satisfactory
standard
in
effect
in
florida.
but
since
1954,
there
has
been
a
standard,
as
i
have
stated,
and
it
does
not
include
oil
content
because
as
we
set
forth,
oil
content
is
not
valid
scientifically
as
a
test
of
maturity
of
the
florida
avocados.
our
first
task
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
granted
that
the
record
discloses
the
existence
of
a
justiciable
controversy
within
the
judicial
power
of
the
federal
courts.
hearing
by
a
three-judge
court
was
mandatory
because
the
complaint
seeks
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
restraining
further
enforcement
against
appellants
by
the
officers
of
california
of
the
statute
of
that
state
upon
the
ground
of
constitutionality
at
28
u.s.c.
2281.
the
judge
of
the
district
court,
upon
consideration
of
the
complaint,
convened
a
three-judge
court.
the
court
heard
and
determined
the
matter
in
the
manner
that
i
have
stated.
the
case
thus
heard
and
determined.
judicial
--
the
judicial
code
provides
for
direct
appeal
to
this
court
as
a
matter
of
course.
no
question
was
raised
in
the
district
court
about
the
propriety
of
a
hearing
by
a
three-judge
court.
this
court,
however,
appellee
jacobsen,
i'm
going
to
say
incidentally,
your
honor,
somewhere
between
the
filing
of
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
filing
of
this
brief
we've
lost
two
of
the
appellees.
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
made
by
three
appellees
but
the
brief
is
by
the
appellee
jacobsen.
and
he
argues
that
the
hearing
in
the
district
court
should
have
been
held
by
a
single
judge
only
instead
of
a
three-judge
court
convened
pursuant
to
section
2281.
therefore,
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
under
section
1253.
the
reason
stated
for
this
contention
is
that
the
complaint
questions,
the
validity
of
the
state
statute,
as
applied
to
appellants,
not
only
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
equal
protection
provision
of
the
constitution
but
also
on
the
ground
of
a
conflict
with
an
act
of
congress
regulating
interstate
commerce
and
a
marketing
agreement
in
effect
thereunder.
this
is
said
not
to
constitute
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality.
and
it
is
urged
that
because
of
the
inclusion
of
this
claim,
the
appeal
should
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals
instead
of
this
court.
your
honors,
the
appellants
do
not
dispute
the
proposition
that
if
a
case
does
not
call
for
a
hearing
by
a
three-judge
district
court
under
28
u.s.c.
2281
and
even
if
it
is
heard
by
such
a
court,
there
is
no
right
of
direct
appeal
to
this
court
under
section
1253.
therefore,
the
decisions
to
this
effect
cited
in
appellees'
brief
are
passed
without
comment.
only
three
of
the
cases
referred
to
by
appellees
say
anything
about
a
conflict
between
a
state
law
and
an
act
of
congress.
lemke
versus
farmers
grain
company,
258
u.s.,
and
in
re
buder,
271
u.s.
and
parker
versus
brown,
317
u.s.
lemke
versus
farmers
grain
company
was
heard
by
a
single
district
judge
and
the
appeal
in
the
first
instance
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
complaint
in
that
case
was
two-fold.
that
the
north
dakota
grain
grading
and
inspection
act
of
1919
violated
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution,
also
that
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
federal
grain
standards
act
of
1916.
the
question
was
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
exercised
jurisdiction
on
the
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
and
this
court
held
that
in
one
phase
of
the
case,
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
was
not
involved,
only
consideration
and
construction
of
both
the
state
and
federal
statutes
and
their
applications
to
the
fact
is
found.
in
the
companion
case
of
lemke
versus
homer
farmers
elevator
co.,
258
u.s.
65
on
a
complaint
of
exactly
the
same
kind,
a
three-judge
district
court
granted
an
injunction
restraining
the
enforcement
of
the
state
statute
and
on
direct
appeal
to
this
court,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed.
in
re
buder
came
to
this
court
on
application
for
mandamus
to
direct
the
district
judge
who
heard
the
case
to
allow
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
as
was
the
practice
then
in
effect.
the
litigation
arose
from
a
tax
levied
against
the
national
bank
and
its
stockholders
under
a
missouri
statute,
the
constitutional
validity
of
which
was
not
questioned.
however,
in
--
in
1923,
congress
made
a
new
enactment
relating
to
the
power
of
the
states
to
tax
national
banks
and
prescribed
choice
of
one
of
three
methods
for
such
taxation.
the
bank
contented
that
the
state
was
required
to
make
an
election
by
a
new
legislation
of
one
of
the
three
permissible
methods
to
tax
national
banks
and
had
as
yet
failed
to
take
such
action.
and
that
meanwhile,
the
state
law
under
which
the
challenged
tax
levy
was
made
had
become
inoperative.
thus,
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
state
law
was
still
enforced,
not
a
question
of
constitutionality.
accordingly,
a
leave
to
file
the
petition
for
mandamus
was
denied.
reference
to
in
re
buder
was
made
in
the
opinion
in
query
versus
united
states,
316
u.s.
486.
an
action
by
the
united
states
against
the
south
carolina
tax
commission
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
a
state
statute
imposing
a
license
tax
for
the
privilege
of
selling
certain
articles
as
attempted
to
be
applied
to
the
sale
of
such
articles
as
the
united

army
--
army
and
post
exchanges
located
in
south
carolina.
a
three-judge
district
court
granted
an
injunction,
but
decided
also
that
the
case
was
properly
one
for
a
single
judge
whereupon
the
appeal
of
the
tax
officers
was
taken
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
the
judgment.
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court.
the
judgment
was
vacated.
and
the
cause
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
enter
a
new
judgment
from
which
a
direct
appeal
could
be
taken
to
this
court.
quoting
from
the
court's
opinion,
"if
no
more
than
a
question
of
construction
of
a
federal
statute
had
been
involved,"
referring
to
the
act
of
congress
giving
consent
for
imposition
of
certain
kinds
of
state
taxes
within
federal
areas,
"there
would
have
been
no
necessity
for
a
three-judge
court
pursuant
to
section
266,"
citing
in
re
buder.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
complaint
was
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
state
law
as
applied
to
complainant
and
that
the
relief
order
was
predicated
upon
the
same
ground.
that
the
unconstitutionality
arose
from
interference
with
an
activity
of
the
united
states.
that
the
relief
purported
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
a
state
statute
on
the
ground
of
unconstitutionality
could
only
have
been
properly
granted
by
a
three-judge
district
court,
and
that
appeal
did
not
lie
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
regulation
of
the
marketing
of
florida
avocados
is
now
an
activity
of
the
federal
government.
and
a
state
statute
interfering
with
that
activity
is
unconstitutional
by
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
at
page
23
of
appellants'
brief,
in
a
long
footnote,
it
is
observed
that
in
parker
versus
brown,
317
u.s.
341,
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
agricultural
prorate
law
enacted
in
1933
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
23.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no,
it's
the
appellees'
brief.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
--
the
footnote
beginning
on
that
page.
now,
this
--
this
pertains
to
a
marketing
act
of
like
nature
with
the
federal
marketing
act
that
was
adopted
by
california
in
1933
and
it
was
challenged
in
that
case
under
the
commerce
clause
also
as
in
conflict
with
the
sherman
act
and
the
federal
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937.
that's
the
jurisdictional
situation
in
that
case
and
the
present
case
is
precisely
the
same.
the
appellee
urges
in
the
fact
that
this
court
would
not
have
entertained
the
direct
appeal
from
this
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
in
parker
versus
brown
if
questions
had
been
raised
about
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal,
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
passed
sub
silentio.
from
my
reading
of
many
decisions
of
this
court,
it
would
be
indeed
a
rare
phenomenon
for
this
court
to
pass
the
question
of
its
own
jurisdiction
sub
silentio.
it
did
not
do
so
in
parker
versus
brown.
i
reported
in
62
supreme
court
946
gave
the
usual
preliminary
consideration
to
the
question
of
its
jurisdiction
and
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
the
claim
of
conflict
of
the
challenged
state
law
with
the
sherman
act
and
the
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937
far
from
deterring
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
this
court
was
apparently
deemed
a
primary
interest
where
on
may
11,
1942,
the
court
made
the
following
order,
this
cause
is
restored
to
the
docket
for
reargument
on
october
12
next.
in
their
briefs
and
on
the
oral
argument,
counsel
for
the
parties
are
requested
to
discuss
the
questions
whether
the
state
statute
involved
is
rendered
invalid
by
the
action
of
congress
in
passing
the
sherman
antitrust
act,
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
as
amended
or
any
other
act
of
congress.
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937
is
in
the
main
merely
a
reenactment
of
valid
sections
of
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
of
1933.
on
the
merits,
this
court
said
in
parker
versus
brown.
we
may
assume
also
that
a
stabilization
program
adopted
under
the
agricultural
act
would
supersede
the
state
act.
but
the
federal
act
becomes
effective
only
if
a
program
is
ordered
by
the
secretary.
the
case
at
bar,
the
federal
act
has
become
effective
by
adoption
of
a
program
specifically
applicable
to
the
marketing
of
florida
avocados.
the
prayer
of
the
appellants
is
that
the
california
statute
complained
of,
this
case
should
not
be
permitted
to
support
this
program.
i
mention
but
one
more
illustrative
case
on
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction.
in
afl
versus
watson,
327
u.s.
582,
florida's
right
to
work
constitutional
amendment
was
complained
of
under
the
various
sections
of
the
constitution
also
as
in
conflict
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
case
was
heard
by
a
three-judge
district
court.
it
came
here
on
direct
appeal
from
that
court
so
that
the
jurisdictional
situation
is
against
same
as
in
this
case.
this
court
held
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
this
is
suit
arising
on
an
act
of
congress
regulating
commerce
and
--
and
put
aside
the
other
alleged
grounds
of
jurisdiction.
it
was
held
further
however
that
exercise
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
would
be
held
in
offense
pending
determination
by
the
state
courts
whether
the
constitutional
amendment
was
self-executing
or
required
enforcement
legislation.
and
if
legislation
was
required,
to
see
if
in
fact
it
invaded
the
field
of
federal
regulation.
i
come
now
to
the
contention
that
there's
no
justiciable
controversy
between
the
parties.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
supplementing
the
brief,
yes,
sir.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
lemke
case?
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
say
that
the
ground
of
the
holding
in
the
lemke
case
was
that
in
one
aspect
of
the
case,
there
was
about
only
a
question
of
construction
of
the
two
statutes
and
not
a
question
of
the
constitutionality,
the
federal
and
the
state,
not
a
question
of
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
state
statute.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that
is
true.
but
as
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
may
i
say
this
first,
your
honor.
there
have
been
many,
many
cases
decided
since
the
lemke
case
and
as
i
have
pointed
out
there
are
cases
where
over
and
over
again,
the
case
comes
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
three-judge
court
where
there
is
joinder
of
the
claim
of
violation
of
specific
clauses
of
the
constitution
and
--
and
interference
or
a
violation
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
oh,
i
have
cited.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
--
i
have
cited
these
because
this
is
a
point
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
have
cited
the
two
orders
of
this
court
which
show
that
in
that
case,
it
was
not
passed
sub
silentio.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
it
--
it
was
heard,
it
was
considered.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
cited
the
two
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
read
it
first.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
read
first
the
ruling
of
probable
jurisdiction.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well,
that
would
means
--
mr.
isaac

--
that
they
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
--
i
take
it,
your
honor,
that
indicates
that
the
rules
of
the
court
were
observed,
that
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed,
and
that
some
answers
were
made
to
it,
and
that
the
matter
had
the
consideration
of
the
court.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well,
not
if
i
take
the
language
of
the
court
itself.
this
court
said
that
in
one
phase
of
the
case,
there
was
no
constitutional
question.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well,
if
it
were
a
question
of
construction.
but
there
is
no
question
of
construction.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well,
i
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no,
because
it
adopts
a
different
standard.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon,
but
i
would
state
it
otherwise.
i
would
say
that
you
have
a
federal
law
that
takes
over
the
regulation
and
establishes
standards
that
no
state
law
can
overturn
that
federal
law.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
would
say,
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
if
that
is
the
court's
opinion,
i
would
not
disagree
with
it,
but
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
i
would
say
that
the
court
in
that
case
and
in
its
subsequent
expressions
indicated
that
there
was
one
phase
of
that
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
consider.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
--
i
would
say
that
when
you
have
a
case
and
it
is
determined
that
the
case
was
properly
one
for
a
hearing
by
a
three-judge
district
court
under
section
2281,
then
you
also
have
a
case
that
is
appealable
directly
to
this
court
under
section
1253.
there
were
other
reasons.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
lemke,
your
honor,
was
heard
by
a
one
judge
court.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that
i
--
is
in
the
companion
case
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
lemke
versus
homer's
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
may
i
beg
to
have
your
honor's
citation
of
the
case?
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
and
at
--
at
page
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
then
follows
page
--
at
265
where
an
injunction
--
by
the
way,
also
in
the
lemke
case,
there
was
no
application
for
injunction.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that's
right,
it
was
--
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
your
honor,
i'm
--
i'm
content
to
rest
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
--
i
appreciate
the
questions
the
your
honors
put
in.
and
i'm
willing
to
submit
it
on
this
basis.
the
court
deems
that
the
lemke
case
should
be
overruled
well
and
good.
and
if
not,
then
the
court
must
overrule
scores
of
decisions
in
which
unconstitutionality
has
been
grounded
upon
conflict
with
federal
regulation.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well,
i
--
i
say
again
that
the
court
in
its
own
language
said
that
in
that
phase
of
the
case,
no
question
of
constitutionality
was
involved.
now,
if
that
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
statement
is
inaccurate,
it's
not
my
statement,
it
is
rather
of
the
court.
our
case
is
akin
to
the
recent
decision
in
public
utilities
commission
of
california
against
united
states,
355
u.s.
534,
which
a
state
law
empowering
the
utilities
commission
to
decide
under
what
conditions
a
common
carrier
will
be
permitted
to
transport
property
at
reduced
rates
as
against
federal
statutes
and
regulations
related
to
government
procurement
of
property
or
services.
a
three-judge
district
court
granted
injunction.
the
case
came
here
on
direct
appeal
and
the
decision
was
affirmed.
that
case,
an
activity
of
the
united
states,
as
i
stated
in
--
in
afl
versus
watson
is
overruled,
overwritten
by
a
state
regulation.
it
wasn't
a
question
of
how
this
regulation
would
work
in
practice
although
some
of
the
judges
of
this
court
thought
that
they
ought
to
wait
and
see
how
it
would
work.
but
the
--
the
essence
of
the
opinion
was
that
the
very
existence
of
that
statute
was
under
the
terms
with
the
government's
operations.
that's
what
we
have
in
this
case.
there
is
no
room
for
a
construction
hearing.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
subject
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal,
i
take
the
interrelated
questions
which
frankly
i
assume
for
the
reason
or
the
form
of
the
order
in
this
case
and
if
there's
not
a
justiciable
controversy,
there's
none
for
any
court
or
in
this
court.
so
i
come
to
that
question.
now
the
decision
of
the
district
court
that
there's
no
present
controversy
turns
on,
on
one
fact
that
in
past
instances,
when
avocados
shipped
by
appellants
to
california
have
been
barred
from
sale
in
that
state
because
it
failed
to
pass
the
8%
oil
test,
appellants
have
availed
themselves
of
leave
to
reship
the
avocados
to
some
other
state
instead
of
submitting
them
to
destruction
as
a
public
nuisance
in
the
manner
provided
by
section
785
of
the
agricultural
code
of
california.
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
only
in
an
abatement
proceeding
under
section
785
could
a
threatened
justiciable
controversy
arise
with
respect
to
a
shipment
of
california
--
to
california
of
florida
avocados
of
less
than
8%
oil
content.
somehow,
the
question
of
constitutionality
of
california's
8%
oil
content
law
an
application
to
florida-grown
avocados
would
have
to
erase
and
passed
upon
in
the
state
court
proceeding
the
kind
provided
in
section
785
for
abatement
of
perishable
fruit.
there
are
two
short
answers
to
the
holding
of
the
district
court.
first
that
the
proceeding
provided
by
section
785
relates
only
to
conformity
or
nonconformity
of
the
fruit
or
other
products
granted
as
a
public
business.
and
second,
if
an
issue
of
constitutionality
of
the
standardization
provision
would
be
raised
in
such
a
summary
proceeding,
it
would
be
a
judicial
issue
and
not
an
administrative
issue.
and
the
result
of
the
district
court's
ruling
would
be
to
compel
the
appellants
to
try
such
judicial
issue
in
a
state
court
notwithstanding
the
act
of
congress
granting
recourse
to
a
federal
court
for
trial
of
such
issue.
on
the
facts
alleged
in
appellants'
complaint,
now
followed
by
evidentiary
matter
and
depositions
and
in
answers
to
interrogatories
and
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
cited
in
division
two
of
appellants'
brief,
it
is
submitted
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
erroneous
and
that
there
exists
a
present
and
substantial
controversy
between
the
parties
regarding
the
constitutional
validity
of
california's
8%
oil
content
requirement
as
applied
to
the
florida
avocados
handled
by
appellants.
in
appellees'
brief
at
page
12,
it
is
said,
"appellants
make
no
claim
of
personal
wrongdoing
against
appellee
regarding
past
shipments
to
california
and
these
transactions
are
closed."
if
this
means
that
appellants
are
not
suing
the
director
of
agriculture
for
damages
in
this
action,
that
is
true.
but
there
is
indeed
a
claim
of
personal
wrongdoing
against
appellee
regarding
the
past
shipment
of
appellees'
avocados
to
california
apart
from
sale
in
that
state
by
appellee
and
its
subordinates,
that
because
of
the
utility
of
a
legal
remedy
for
such
a
wrongdoing,
appellants
are
seeking
equitable
relief.
and
at
page
12
of
appellees'
brief,
it
has
said
also
that
appellants
have
not
in
any
time
violated
the
california
law.
the
--
the
standardization
provision
of
the
california
code
relating
to
avocados
is
section
792,
which
is
page
6
of
the
appendix
to
appellants'
brief.
one
of
the
enforcement
provisions
is
section
784.
this
section
states
what
acts
are
unlawful
if
the
fruit
or
other
product
is
nonconforming.
there
are
10
verbs
in
section
784
specifying
the
acts
prohibited
with
respect
to
nonconforming
products,
namely,
to
prepare,
pack,
place,
deliver
for
shipment,
deliver
for
sale,
load,
ship,
transport,
cost
to
be
transported
for
sale.
the
complaint
and
deposition
showed
that
appellants
have
made
shipments
of
avocados
to
california
only
when
pretesting
indicated
probability
that
the
avocados
would
pass
the
california
8%
oil
test.
but
these
were
almost
all
avocados
of
but
one
variety
out
of
the
many
varieties
of
the
fruit
grown
in
florida,
and
that
even
these
limited
shipments
could
not
be
ventured
until
late
in
the
marketing
season.
but
that
despite
all
cautions,
there
were
12
specific
instances
in
which
the
appellants
shipped
to
california
avocados,
there
are
found
to
be
of
less
than
8%
oil
content.
when
the
avocados
reached
the
point
of
destination
in
california
and
where
they're
tested
for
oil
content
found
to
be
nonconforming,
they
were
tagged
as
nonconforming
by
the
enforcing
officer
and
held
under
official
control
for
further
proceedings.
at
the
moment
the
avocados
were
so
tagged,
they
were
condemned
as
a
public
nuisance
subject
to
prompt
for
abatement
as
provided
in
section
785
of
the
agricultural
code
unless
reconditioned.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
it's
beyond
my
imagination,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
you
can't
raise
the
oil
content
of
a
load
of
avocados.
and
you
can't,
in
any
visual
way,
pick
out
those
that
have
less
than
8%
oil
content.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
to
make
such
a
judgment
by
external
cares.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that's
exactly
what
i
argue.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
you
mean
the
appellants
here?
they
put
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
it
was
not
found
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
to
be
practical.
no
practical
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
way.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no.
i
--
i
called
your
attention,
your
honor,
to
the
fact
that
this
provision
for
reconditioning
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
is
not
in
the
statute
with
specific
relation
to
avocados.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
it's
in
the
statute
in
relation
to
all
products
as
to
which
there
are
standardization
provisions.
and
there's
--
in
many
instances,
there
might
be
reconditioning,
a
very
prompt
reconditioning.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
it
might
be
the
container.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
it
might
the
method
of
packaging.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
and
it
might
be
external
climate
issues.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
but
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
know
of
no
way,
your
honor,
that
it
could
be
done.
moreover,
it
--
it
wouldn't
meet
the
fundamental
proposition
that
we're
only
talking
about
those
that
were
expected
to
meet
the
8
--
8%
oil
test
while
there
are
varieties
of
florida
avocados
of
high
grade,
which
make
no
more
than
2%
oil
content.
you
can
eat
them
here.
[laughs]
you
cannot
get
them
in
california.
by
a
grace
of
a
regulation
made
by
the
director
of
agriculture,
it
was
permissible
to
send
the
load
of
nonconforming
avocados
to
an
out-of-state
destination
under
a
written
authorization
by
the
enforcing
officer
and
under
official
surveillance
to
the
point
of
exit
from
the
state.
when
a
load
of
avocados
goes
from
florida
to
california
because
their
tag
is
nonconforming,
the
sender
has
done
all
but
one
of
the
acts
forbidden
by
section
784
of
the
agricultural
code.
he
has
placed
the
nonconforming
avocados
within
the
state,
caused
them
to
be
transported
and
delivered
from
them
for
sale.
it
is
at
this
point
that
control
of
the
fruit
is
taken
over
by
the
enforcing
officer.
only
the
final
act
is
not
done,
consummation
of
sale
in
california.
reshipment
of
the
condemned
avocados
to
an
out-of-state
destination
in
the
hope
of
salvage
does
not
undo
what
has
happened
in
california.
neither
the
acts
of
appellants
and
they
are
kept
to
consummate
sale
of
the
fruit
in
california
nor
the
acts
of
the
california
officers
in
applying
to
appellants'
avocados
the
provisions
of
the
challenged
statute.
appellants
cite
the
decision
in
evers
versus
dwyer,
358
u.s.
202
in
support
of
jurisdiction
both
the
district
court
and
this
court
in
the
present
case.
in
appellees'
brief
at
page
27,
it
has
said,
“the
plaintiff
in
evers
versus
dwyer,
a
negro,
immediately
violated
the
memphis
segregation
ordinance
at
the
moment
he
seated
himself
in
the
front
portion
of
the
public
bus.
at
this
point,
the
justiciable
controversy
came
into
existence.
the
facts
which
were
formed
the
basis
of
the
litigation
were
fixed
and
would
never
be
more
concrete.
if
the
plaintiff
had
been
arrested,
put
to
trial
for
a
violation
of
an
ordinance
or
statute,
there
might
have
been
an
issue
as
to
the
precise
act
by
which
the
offense
was
committed.
but
the
controversy
with
which
this
court
was
concerned
was
not
that
of
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
bus
passenger
in
the
particular
occurrence.
the
matter
with
which
this
court
was
concerned
was
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
tennessee
statute
requiring
segregated
seating
arrangements
according
to
race
in
public
buses.
in
the
incident
that
prompted
the
plaintiff
to
file
his
action
for
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
in
the
federal
court,
the
facts
noted
were
that
when
plaintiff
seated
himself
at
the
front
of
the
vehicle,
the
driver
told
him
to
move
to
the
rear
and
that
this
was
required
by
law
because
of
his
color.
and
that
following
the
plaintiff's
refusal
to
comply,
two
police
officers
boarded
the
bus
and
ordered
the
plaintiff
to
go
to
the
back
of
bus
or
get
off
or
be
arrested.
and
that
thereupon,
the
plaintiff
left
the
bus.what
gave
rise
to
the
justiciable
controversy
regarding
the
constitutionality
of
the
tennessee
statute
was
not
simply
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
sat
down
in
the
front
part
of
the
bus,
but
that
the
driver
of
the
bus
and
the
police
officers
clearly
manifested
the
intention
of
the
persons
in
charge
with
the
bus
to
enforce
the
state's
segregation
statute
in
a
manner
denying
to
plaintiff
and
the
class
of
persons
in
whose
behalf
he
sued
use
of
the
public
buses
without
discrimination
and
humiliation
because
of
racial
origin.
the
crux
of
the
court's
holding
is
in
this
sentence.
a
resident
of
a
municipality
who
cannot
use
transportation
facilities
therein
without
being
subjected
by
statute
to
special
disabilities
necessarily
has,
we
think,
a
substantial,
immediate
and
real
interest
in
the
validity
of
the
statute
which
imposes
the
disability.
fundamental
principle,
the
jurisdictional
situation,
the
case
at
bar
is
the
same.
appellants
who
are
engaged
in
nationwide
marketing
of
florida
avocados,
under
the
agents
of
the
federal
constitution,
complained
that
they
are
subjected
to
commercial
handicap
and
discrimination
by
a
california
statute
barring
sale
in
that
state
of
avocados
with
less
than
8%
oil
content.
and
it
is
submitted
no
sacrificial
offering
of
a
load
of
avocados
is
needed
to
prove
that
appellee
and
his
subordinates
have
for
years
enforced
california's
oil
content
requirement
against
avocados
coming
from
florida
and
will
continue
to
enforce
this
requirement
so
long
as
the
statute
remains
in
force,
unless
stayed
by
declaration
or
writ
of
court.
in
this
case,
in
contrast
with
public
commission
of
utah
versus
wycoff
company,
344
u.s.,
there
is
absolute
certainty
of
the
matter
in
which
the
challenged
state
regulation
applies
to
the
marketing
of
florida
avocados.
the
prohibition
against
sale
in
california
of
avocados
with
less
than
oil
--
8%
oil
content
is
unqualified
and
without
exception
regardless
of
place
of
origin,
quality,
maturity
or
federal
regulation.
there
is
contrast
in
this
respect
between
the
avocado
section
of
the
california
code
and
other
sections
of
the
same
code.
for
example,
the
standardization
provisions
relating
to
containers
of
fruits,
nuts
and
vegetables
are
expressly
declared
inapplicable
to
shipments
from
outside
the
state
in
containers
established
as
standard
by
the
applicable
laws
or
regulations
of
the
united
states
at
section
788.
the
standardization
provisions
says
as
to
apples,
it
was
revised
in
1957,
are
declared
inapplicable
to
apples
shipped
into
california
from
other
states
if
accompanied
by
an
official
certificate
stating
that
such
apples
have
met
the
maturity
requirements
of
the
state
of
origin,
section
827.7.
other
standardization
provisions
of
the
code
give
effect
to
inherent
differences
between
varieties
of
the
fruit
are
--
are
differences
arising
from
growing
conditions,
different
regions
of
the
state
making
one
standard
for
this
geographical
division
as
a
different
standard
for
the
other
geographically
division.
also
some
of
the
standards
allow
a
5%
or
10%
tolerance.
the
8%
oil
requirement
for
avocados
is
quite
unique
and
it
start
rigidity
thus
emphasizing
the
arbitrary
disregard
of
applicable
horticultural
factors.
i
shall
respond
to
one
other
point
in
appellees'
brief.
it's
argued
aside
from
the
question
whether
or
not
there
is
a
justiciable
controversy,
i
hope
the
court
will
not
have
much
trouble
with
that
word
as
i
have
many,
that
appellants
have
not
shown
danger
of
great
and
irreparable
injury,
therefore,
are
not
entitled
to
the
equitable
relief
right
in
their
complaint.
i
quote
from
page
33
of
the
appellees'
brief,
“it
is
significant
that
appellants
have
never
applied
for
interlocutory
relief
during
the
two
years
that
have
elapsed
since
they
filed
their
complaint.
this
a
further
indication
that
appellants
are
not
suffering
the
kind
of
immediate
injury
which
will
prompt
a
federal
court
to
exercise
its
equitable
powers
in
the
suit
to
enjoin
public
officers
from
the
enforcement
of
the
state
law.”
the
appellants'
complaint
was
filed
november
13,
1957.
and
actually,
the
complaint
was
filed
by
the
defendants
on
december
6,
1957.
depositions
of
various
witnesses
accounting
for
335
pages
of
the
printed
record
were
taken
in
miami,
florida
january
1958.
interrogatories
were
served
by
both
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants.
on
february
24,
1958,
appellants
filed
a
motion
appearing
on
page
29
of
the
record
requesting
the
court
to
set
the
action
for
trial
at
the
early
convenience
of
the
court
and
stating
the
reasons
for
this
request.
paragraphs
5
and
6
of
this
motion
showed
that
all
depositions
intended
to
be
taken
have
been
taken.
and
that
other
discovery
procedure
could
be
completed
within
a
time
limited
by
the
court.
paragraph
4,
i
quote,
“the
next
marketing
season
for
the
avocados
handled
by
plaintiffs
commences
about
july
1,
1958.
therefore,
the
action
is
of
emergency
nature.”
and
then
the
concluding
paragraph,
number
7,
“this
request
to
set
the
action
for
trial
is
made
in
lieu
of
an
application
by
plaintiffs
for
an
interlocutory
injunction
since
the
hearing
of
such
application
may
be
obviated
by
plenary
trial
of
the
action
and
entry
of
a
final
decree.”
this
motion
was
still
pending
april
18,
1958
when
the
three-judge
court
first
came
into
session.
there
was
then
also
pending
the
motion
of
the
defendants
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
the
latter
motion
was
heard
and
taken
under
advice
consequently
the
motion
to
set
the
case
for
early
trial
received
no
attention.
eight
months
passed
before
the
court
announced
the
ruling
which
accounts
for
this
appeal,
eight
months
during
which
the
appellants
could
do
nothing
further
in
the
case.
the
further
statement
on
page
33
of
appellees'
brief
is
quite
ironic,
that
if
a
justiciable
controversy
exist,
appellants
could
have
sought
declaratory
relief
in
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
california
and
that
under
this
remedy,
appellants
would
be
entitled
to
an
expeditious
hearing
of
their
case.
the
implication
seems
to
be
that
speedier
justice
is
obtainable
in
the
superior
court
of
california
and
in
the
district
court
of
united
states
for
the
northern
district
of
california.be
that
as
it
may,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
appellants
have
not
been
lacking
in
diligence
in
seeking
the
equitable
relief
for
which
they
pray
in
their
complaint.
i
submit
also
that
there
is
a
point
in
showing
that
the
record
of
this
case
without
need
of
an
added
sacrifice,
that
appellants
at
the
present
continuing
in
substantial
interest
in
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
california
statute
of
which
they
complained.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
in
the
moment
that
i
have
left
u
an
reverting
it
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal,
the
argument
seems
to
boil
down
to
one
point.
appellants
claim
that
the
california
statute,
as
applied
to
them,
conflicts
with
the
federal
market
agreement
and
the
regulations
adopted
thereunder
for
the
marketing
of
florida
avocados.
appellee
contends
that
this
is
not
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality.
i
remind
the
court
in
particular
of
the
series
of
cases
recently
decided
in
which
various
state
enactments
relating
to
labor
relations
have
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
unconstitutional
and
invalid,
because
of
conflict
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
impinging
upon
the
federal
regulation.
most
of
these
cases
have
come
to
this
court
on
appeal
from
state
courts,
which
yesterday
i
mentioned
one
that
came
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court,
american
federation
of
labor
versus
watson
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
was
upheld
and
the
jurisdiction
was
entertained
of
the
appeal,
which
in
that
respect,
is
exactly
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
your
honor.
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
as
applied
to
the
avocados
which
are
marketed
under
the
federal
regulation
that
was
void
in
the
state
act
in
that
application.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
we're
talking
about
a
law
in
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce,
the
validity
of
which
is
--
and
upheld
and
unquestioned.
when
that
law
is
enforced,
no
state
law
can
overwrite
it,
as
in
this
case
is
done
by
the
california
statute.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
it's
absolutely
mandatory.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no,
your
honor.
no,
the
grounds
are
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
it
is
the
federal
constitution
that
maintains
free
trade
among
the
states.
and
as
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
say
many
times,
that
is
one
of
the
most
important
reasons
for
the
adoption
of
the
federal
constitution.
so
that
this
case,
even
though
it
relates
to
exotic
fruit
as
my
friend
has
said,
it
relates
also
to
one
the
most
vital
functions
of
the
federal
constitution.
thank
you.
