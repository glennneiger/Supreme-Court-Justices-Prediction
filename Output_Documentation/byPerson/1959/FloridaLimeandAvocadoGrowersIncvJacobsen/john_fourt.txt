mr.
john
fourt
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
associate
justices.
this
case
involves
an
exotic
fruit,
avocado.
the
appellee
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
present
this
case
on
the
merits,
this
posture
of
the
case
being
ruled
on
in
a
matter
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
i
should
like
to
briefly
describe
what
the
case
is
about
and
what
the
contentions
are
of
the
parties.
avocados
are
a
fruit
which
you
use
for
food.
avocados
are
grown
both
in
florida
and
california.
they're
utilized
by
the
housewife
mainly
in
green
salads.
the
housewife
purchased
an
avocado
in
the
store
when
it's
hard.
in
room
temperature
at
home,
it
softens.
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
housewife
to
tell
of
the
maturity
of
the
avocado
from
the
time
she
buys
it.
the
avocado
is
hard.
touch
does
not
indicate
maturity.
appearance
does
not
indicate
maturity.
the
oil
content
of
an
avocado
increases
as
the
avocado
matures.
california,
since
1925,
has
required
that
all
avocados
sold
in
the
state
contain
a
minimum
of
8%
oil
content.
the
purpose
is
to
protect
the
consumer
of
california.
the
device
of
ensuring
a
minimum
oil
content
is
a
guarantee
of
maturity,
we
believe,
is
a
reasonable
device
to
ensure
that
protection.
mr.
john
fourt
i
do
not
understand
the
question.
this
--
this
testing
program
has
continued
since
1925.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
this
requirement
applies
to
all
avocados
sold
in
california
irregardless
of
origin
even
avocados
from
cuba
or
hawaii.
the
appellants'
contentions
are
that
the
california
statute
constitutes
a
discriminatory
trade
barrier
that
of
the
california
statute
conflicts
with
a
controlling
federal
statute.
on
the
merits,
appellee
contends
that
the
california
statute
is
not
discriminatory,
that
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
we
will
show
that
over
95%
of
the
florida
avocados
by
volume
will
comply
with
the
california
statute.
that
florida
avocados
have
been
successfully
reconditioned
upon
inspection
in
california
and
as
reconditions
have
met
the
california
statute.
mr.
john
fourt
avocados
upon
arrival
in
california
can
be
divided
by
size,
that
is
size
12,
14,
16
and
18.
the
--
this
practice
experience
that
is
the
smaller
size
avocados
that
fail
to
meet
the
inspection.
first,
the
shipper-handler
removes
the
lower
--
the
smaller
size
avocados
from
a
lot.
that
eliminates
that
problem.
further,
they
make
oil
test
on
avocados
in
the
containers
in
the
lot
and
they
will
find
a
variation
in
the
lot
that
is
some
logs
of
avocados
will
comply
and
others
will
not.
they
take
an
adequate
sample
of
logs
and
log,
say,
one
avocado,
14
will
pass
generally
and
the
rest
of
the
avocados
and
the
log
will
pass.
the
avocados
then
that
did
not
pass
are
reshipped.
those
that
will
pass
will
be
marketed
freely
in
california.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
the
term
"recondition"
in
the
california
agricultural
code
means
to
bring
in
to
compliance
regardless
of
the
commodity,
regardless
of
the
defects.
it
may
be
rotten,
it
may
be
oil
content,
anything
to
bring
in
compliance,
you
recondition
it.
mr.
john
fourt
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
identical
--
identical
process.
mr.
john
fourt
the
record
show
that
96%
of
the
avocados
shipped
by
appellants
to
california
have
complied
with
california
law.
the
california
ambers
do
not
have
that
in
the
record.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
the
claim
of
the
appellants.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
the
appellants
specifically
take
the
position
they
do
not
contest
the
inspection
procedure
in
california.
mr.
john
fourt
contest
the
inspection
procedure
in
california.
mr.
john
fourt
they
contest
the
application
of
the
oil
test,
the
8%
oil
test.
they
do
not
contest
the
determination
as
to
whether
the
florida
avocados
comply
with
this
law.
mr.
john
fourt
none.
mr.
john
fourt
the
threshold
question
before
this
court
is
whether
this
court
has
appellate
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case.
the
appellate
jurisdiction
depends
on
whether
a
three-judge
court
was
necessarily
contained
in
this
case.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened.
we
do
not
believe
it
was
necessarily
convened.
appellants
have
joined
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
state
statute
where
they
claim
that
the
state
statute
conflicts
with
a
controlling
federal
statute.
the
issue
or
the
claim
that
a
state
statute
is
superseded
by
a
controlling
federal
statute
does
not
raise
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
john
fourt
it
may
but
not
necessarily
so.
mr.
john
fourt
now,
that
was
the
square
holding
of
the
--
of
this
court
in
lemke
versus
farmers
grain
company
and
--
mr.
john
fourt
the
claim
that
the
state
statute
conflicts
with
a
controlling
federal
statute
does
not
necessarily
raise
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
the
--
as
explained
by
justice
day,
the
court
was
to
construe
the
federal
statute,
construe
the
state
statute
and
compare
the
two.
the
language
of
section
28,
united
states
code
2281,
does
not
answer
the
problem
here
presented,
that
is
does
the
three-judge
procedure
in
the
district
court
necessarily
apply
where
a
constitutional
claim
is
joined
with
a
non-constitutional
claim?
the
language
states
that
the
attack
should
be
on
the
ground
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
such
statute.
if
such
a
ground
exists,
in
and
by
itself,
there
can
be
no
question.
our
position
going
to
the
essence
of
our
case
if
that
--
if
other
issues
are
joined
that
one,
the
case
--
the
injection
of
the
non-constitutional
case
goes
beyond
the
language
of
the
statute.
that
the
injection
of
the
other
issues
would
produce
an
anomalous
result,
third,
that
this
statute
was
designed
to
protect
the
states
from
the
--
the
precipitous
action
of
a
single
judge
federal
court
was
not
designed
as
a
statute
of
broad
social
policy
such
as
the
workmen's
compensation
statute,
that
the
language
is
ambiguous,
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
it
needs
construction
that
--
allowing
the
joinder
of
the
constitutional
and
non-constitutional
issues
would
broaden
the
statute
beyond
the
language
and
broaden
it
to
produce
anomalous
result.
now,
here
is
the
anomalous
result.
if
a
non-constitutional
issue
is
joined
with
a
constitutional
issue,
the
district
court
is
based
--
is
faced
with
the
rule,
basic
rule
that
if
at
all
possible,
a
constitutional
issue
will
be
avoided.
so
in
this
case,
the
three-judge
court,
if
at
all
possible
would
based
its
decision
on
the
conflict
between
state
and
federal
law,
we
then
have
--
would
have
a
anomalous
situation
of
a
three-judge
court
convened
to
hear
a
constitutional
issue
but
deciding
it
on
a
non-constitutional
issue.
mr.
john
fourt
to
the
district
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
to
the
court
of
appeals,
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
not
--
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
this
is
a
technical
statute
covering
a
special
limited
situation.
if
the
plaintiff,
in
framing
his
complaint,
takes
the
case
out
of
the
statute,
the
single
judge
may
hear
both
the
constitutional
and
the
non-constitutional
issues.
this
court
has
always
nearly
construed
the
statute
so
that
it
does
not
cover
all
attacks
on
state
statutes
even
though
an
injunction
is
sought
against
the
state
officer.
mr.
john
fourt
nothing.
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
therefore
it
requires
construction.
our
position
is
that
that
construction
should
be
narrowed
because
of
the
limited
purpose
of
the
statute
to
protect
the
states
against
the
one
judge
superior
court
in
granting
an
injunction
on
the
grounds
of
unconstitutionality.
conceivably,
the
court
may
disagree
with
us.
but
in
doing
so,
it
will
increase
the
burden
of
the
district
courts
because
they
let
to
convene
three
judges,
one
of
whom
must
be
a
member
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
secondly,
the
obligatory
burden
of
this
court
would
be
increased.
now,
those
questions
do
not
relate
to
construction,
they
relate
to
the
type
of
construction
given
by
the
statute
which
we
believe
should
be
narrowed.
mr.
john
fourt
this
court
has
not
construed
the
case
in
--
in
different
situations.
for
example,
a
state
statute
maybe
attacked
as
unconstitutional.
if
the
defendant
is
a
municipal
officer
and
the
issue
is
local,
the
court
has
held
that
the
three-judge
procedure
does
not
apply.
basically,
the
three-judge
procedure
does
not
relate
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
obviously
can
decide
all
the
issues
before
it
assuming
a
substantial
federal
question.
the
question
is
here.
must
a
one-judge
federal
court
or
a
three-judge
federal
court
decide
a
case
of
a
constitutional
together
with
non-constitutional
issue?
mr.
john
fourt
we
do
not
hold
that
position.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
--
that
is
our
position.
mr.
john
fourt
if
i
understand
the
question
not
only
if
--
if
the
complaint
raised
only
a
constitutional
question,
then
a
three
--
mr.
john
fourt
no,
then
it
would
taken
without
the
statute.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
for
example,
in
the
wycoff
case,
this
court
by
--
by
necessary
implication
held
that
a
--
a
case
attacking
a
state
statute
on
grounds
of
unconstitutionality
but
asking
only
for
declaratory
relief
would
be
heard,
properly
heard
by
a
one
judge
court.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
to
our
knowledge,
no
subsequent
case
has
brought
in
to
question
that
holding
of
lemke.
mr.
john
fourt
in
analogous
statutes
dealing
with
the
obligatory
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
for
example,
28
u.s.c.
1254
and
1257,
the
court
--
the
congress
has
used
the
words
“attack
on
a
state
statute
as
repugnant
to
the
constitution,
treaties
or
laws
of
the
united
states.”
congress
has
recognized
the
difference
between
an
attack
on
a
state
statute
on
the
grounds
of
some
constitutionalities
and
an
attack
on
a
state
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
--
it
conflicts
with
the
controlling
federal
law
and
both
of
these
--
one
statute
pertains
to
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
court
of
appeals,
the
other
statute,
using
the
same
language,
refers
to
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
highest
state
court.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
the
debates
in
the
senate
where
the
precise
language
involved
here
was
added
to
section
7
to
the
act
creating
the
commerce
court
disclosed
that
the
senators
were
alarmed
at
what
they
called
hair-trigger
injunctions
granted
by
a
single
judge
district
courts.
one
senator
said
that
such
an
injunction
almost
created
a
riot
in
his
state
and
another
senator
observed
that
at
the
--
that
in
his
state,
a
federal
single
judge
federal
court
had
issued
injunction
12
minutes
after
the
governor
had
signed
the
--
the
statute,
the
bill
into
effect.
now,
from
that
debate,
it's
obvious
that
this
language
was
intended
to
cover
a
special
situation
that
is
the
invalidating
of
a
state
statute
on
the
grounds
of
its
unconstitutionality
by
one
judge.
and
that
issue
was
the
only
issue
considered
by
congress.
that
debate
shows
what
congress
had
in
mind.
it
does
not
answer
the
question
as
to
how
broad
this
procedure
covers.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
this
statute
does
not
--
the
three-judge
procedure
statute
does
not
relate
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
but
to
the
manner
of
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
fourt
we
have
the
references
to
the
congressional
record.
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
mr.
john
fourt
now,
there
is
one
doctrine
which
is
more
difficult
to
me
and
that
is
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction.
we
do
not
believe
this
doctrine
applicable
to
a
case
such
is
involved
this
statute
where
the
question
is
not
the
exercise
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
but
the
manner
which
it
was
exercised.
ancillary
jurisdiction
is
a
necessary
doctrine
in
the
article
3
in
order
that
a
federal
court
may
hear
an
entire
case.
therefore,
if
a
federal
district
court
has
before
it
a
substantial
federal
issue,
it
may
hear
all
local
or
state
issues.
they
completely
dispose
of
the
case.
however,
in
this
case,
we
conceive
that
the
federal
district
court
sitting
of
one
judge
may
dispose
of
all
the
issues.
therefore,
the
question
is
not
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction.
however,
this
court
in
a
case
attacking
a
state
statute
both
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
the
federal
constitution
and
the
state
constitution
held
that
under
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
that
the
three-judge
court
should
consider
the
questions.
that
case
is
louisville
&
nashville
railway
co.
versus
garrett
in
231
u.s.
298.
the
case
can
be
distinguished
on
the
facts
but
it's
surely
inconsistent
with
our
position,
our
answer
is
that
--
mr.
john
fourt
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.

discussion
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
231
u.s.
298,
pages
303,
304.
and
that
case
was
the
--
the
holding
of
that
case
that
the
three-judge
court
would
--
would
hear
both
local
state
questions
and
the
federal
constitutional
questions
was
followed
without
discussion
by
the
court
in
sterling
versus
constantin,
282
u.s.
378.
now,
in
answer
to
those
cases,
i
just
--
a
--
look
at
the
briefs
disclosed
that
counsel
did
not
discuss
this
jurisdictional
point
although
the
court
certainly
did
in
the
earlier
cases
that
we
distinguished
them
on
the
grounds
that
this
does
not
involved
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
--
of
the
district
court
but
merely
the
manner
of
its
exercise.
mr.
john
fourt
merely
the
manner
of
its
exercise,
that
is
the
court,
where
they're
sitting
in
one
judge
or
three
judges
will
dispose
of
all
the
issues
before
it.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
we
do
not
believe
so
because
--
mr.
john
fourt
if
the
--
the
question
is
whether
this
statute
applies.
now,
if
it
applies
to
a
given
situation
where
--
if
the
statute
applies,
then
the
court
is
correct
that
the
three-judge
statute
hears
everything
that
is
all
issues
raised.
we
believe
that
--
that
where
the
issues
are
joined
is
without
the
statute
and
then
a
single
judge
may
hear
all
the
issues.
now,
it
is
not
jurisdictional
because
in
either
event,
the
federal
district
court
will
hear
all
of
the
issues.
it
is
merely
will
one
judge
hear
the
issues,
will
three
judge
hears
--
hear
the
issues.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
precisely
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
john
fourt
it
is
our
position.
mr.
john
fourt
we
can
only
note
that
the
question
is
open
before
the
court,
reasonable
minds
may
differ.
[laughter]
the
appellants
here,
of
course,
are
entitled
to
their
day
in
court
regarding
whether
a
case
or
controversy
exists.
if
the
appellee
is
correct
and
this
court
lacks
appellate
jurisdiction,
we
suggest
that
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
whereas
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
with
instructions
that
the
court
enter
a
new
judgment
from
which
the
appellants
may
take
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
fourt
enter
a
new
judgment
identical
with
the
existing
judgment,
dismissing
the
case
but
from
which
the
appellants
then
may
take
a
timely
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
the
appellants
here
have
not
taken
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
this
court
in
previous
cases
of
this
nature
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
this
court
in
previous
cases
has
not
denied
the
appellant
who
made
the
mistake
appealing
to
the
wrong
court,
his
day
in
court.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
is
our
position.
in
a
case
of
this
nature,
the
rule
would
be
opposite
if
only
a
constitutional
issue
was
raised
or
if
only
part
one
or
two
constitutional
issues
are
raised.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
is
our
position
they
can.
the
district
court
--
the
three-judge
district
court
dismissed
the
judgment,
dismissed
the
appellants'
case
on
the
grounds
that
no
case
or
controversy
existed
between
the
parties.
realistically,
the
appellants'
grievance
here
is
with
the
california
statute.
for
example,
their
statute,
their
complaint
alleges
plaintiffs
have
been
deterred
from
making
shipments
of
florida
avocados
to
california
because
of
the
california
statute.
that's
record
13.
there
is
no
claim
made
that
the
appellee
has
committed
a
personal
wrong
or
trespass
against
the
appellant.
what
has
he
done?
the
record
on
page
441
gives
the
answer.
the
appellants'
agents
in
california
were
given
a
courtesy
informational
notice
of
violation.
the
--
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
any
of
the
appellants'
lots
had
been
seized.
the
appellants,
their
california
agents
were
informed.
we
have
inspected
the
lot.
it
does
not
comply
with
california
law.
it
is
subject
to
abatement
under
california
law.
you
must
either
recondition
or
transship.
if
you
do
nothing,
then
it
is
subject
to
proceedings
taken
in
the
state
courts
to
abate
the
--
the
lot
as
a
nuisance.
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
the
appellant,
at
no
time,
have
violated
california
law.
the
mere
possession
of
a
noncomplying
lot
of
fruit
in
california
is
not
a
violation
of
california
law.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
law
to
sell
commodities,
fruit
which
do
not
comply
with
california
minimum
standards,
quality
standards.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
law
if
the
california
authorities
seize
the
lot
and
then
the
lot
is
sold.neither
of
those
circumstances
appear
here.
the
appellants,
upon
receiving
this
informational
notice,
voluntarily
transshipped
the
lot
to
neighboring
western
markets.
mr.
john
fourt
the
appellants'
grievance
is
with
the
california
statute.
mr.
john
fourt
no,
i'm
now
discussing
the
existence
of
case
or
controversy,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
the
appellants
wish
to
sue
the
appellee
in
the
federal
district
court,
they
must
find
a
personal
wrong
or
a
trespass.
if
not,
then
the
action
against
the
appellee
state
officer
is
representative
only
and
in
fact
is
their
suit
against
the
state
of
california.
this
action
then
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
so
held
by
this
court
in
ex
parte
young.
mr.
john
fourt
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
the
--
in
--
the
appellants'
grievance
must
be
with
the
appellee
not
with
the
state
statute.
in
the
absence
of
a
personal
wrong
by
appellee
towards
appellants
such
as
a
trespass,
some
damage,
interference
with
their
marketers,
this
then
is
merely
a
represented
--
an
action
against
appellee
in
his
representative
capacity
as
a
state
officer.
in
fact
then,
it
is
a
suit
against
the
state
of
california
which
cannot
be
maintained
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
dispute
between
appellant
and
appellee
must
be
based
on
wrongful
conduct
by
appellee,
not
merely
the
existence
of
the
state
statute.
this
court
held
in
the
mitchell
case
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
statute
does
not
constitute
a
sufficient
threat
to
constitute
a
suit
against
that
officer.
there
must
be
personal
wrongdoing.
mr.
john
fourt
we
do
not
find
such
allegations.
the
allegations
which
approach
this
area
described
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
are
plaintiffs
are
now
constantly
receiving
offers
to
purchase
florida
avocados
from
dealers
in
california
but
cannot
avail
themselves
of
such
offers
without
prohibitive
risk
of
loss
if
the
defendants
are
permitted
to
continue
to
enforce
section
792
of
the
agricultural
code.
mr.
john
fourt
permitted
to
continue
to
enforce
is
that
a
seizure
of
any
of
their
lot,
is
that
a
threat
of
arrest?
is
this
a
threat
of
prosecution
in
california?
mr.
john
fourt
no
such
allegation,
your
honor.
that
was
--
mr.
john
fourt
the
appellants
must
show
that
appellee
has
committed
a
personal
wrong.
mr.
john
fourt
seizure,
of
course,
would
do
it.
mr.
john
fourt
arrest,
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
the
calling
is
voluntary
by
the
appellants.
a
threat
of
arrest,
a
threat
of
prosecution
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
none
of
those
--
yes?
mr.
john
fourt
there
are
--
so
far
as
the
allegations
of
the
appellants'
complaint
here
all
lots
shipped
to
california
and
which
failed
to
comply
with
california
were
reshipped
out
of
the
state.
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
the
--
there
was
no
reconditioning
occurred
by
appellants.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
no
such
claim
was
made.
mr.
john
fourt
their
claim
is
that
they
received
an
informational
notice
of
non-compliance
which
is
--
mr.
john
fourt
--
oh,
from
the
state
officers.
it's
shown
on
--
on
page
441.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
but
it
was
completely
a
hypothetical
and
contingent
risk.
mr.
john
fourt
the
honorable
justice
in
using
the
word
“might”
has
stricken
the
heart
of
this
thing.
the
state
officers
might
have
done
a
number
of
things.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
no,
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
the
notice
which
is
plaintiffs'
exhibit
22
on
page
441
of
the
record
which
says,
“standardization
violation
notice.
the
below
described
lot
including
the
containers
thereof
is
a
public
nuisance
unless
reconditioned
or
otherwise
brought
into
compliance.
the
transportation
or
sale
of
such
lot
is
illegal.”
mr.
john
fourt
as
long
as
the
lot
remains
where
it
is.
mr.
john
fourt
no,
no,
no
violation
occurs.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
that
--
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
associate
justices.
at
the
time
of
adjournment,
we
were
discussing
the
precise
acts
or
conduct
of
appellee
with
regard
the
appellant.
specifically
was
the
notice
which
is
given
by
the
appellee
to
the
appellants
upon
the
ascertainment
that
certain
avocados
do
not
comply
with
the
state
statute.
plaintiff's
exhibit
22
shows
this
type
of
notice.
1874
lots
of
avocados
were
inspected
and
361
were
found
to
be
out
of
compliance.
our
position
is
that
this
notice
is
informational.
the
results
of
the
oil
tests
were
given
and
the
appellants
were
informed
that
they
could
recondition
the
non-complying
avocados,
that
is
cull
them
out.
yes?
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
it's
a
record
on
441
that
the
appellants
could
transship
the
non-complying
avocados
out
of
the
state
or
that
the
avocados
could
be
diverted
to
non-human
food
uses.
two
things
then
were
present,
appellant
was
informed
that
certain
logs
of
avocados
failed
to
comply
with
state
law
and
the
statute
was
substantially
described
to
the
appellant.
he
was
given
notice
of
the
contents
of
the
state
statute.
this
then
did
not
constitute
the
type
of
action
required
to
show
a
trespass
or
personal
misconduct
by
the
appellee.
nothing
then
existed
except
the
statute
itself
plus
the
announcement
by
appellee
that
he
stood
ready
to
perform
his
duty.
the
court
below
held
--
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
what
would
be
done
if
he
did
nothing?
would
be
that
abetting
proceedings
would
be
filed
forthwith
in
a
superior
court
of
the
state
of
california.
now--
mr.
john
fourt
our
position
is
that
something
further
would
have
to
occur
before
a
case
or
controversy
would
arise.
mr.
john
fourt
that
if
--
i
take
it
that
--
i
further
step
the
lot
would
be
seized
by
the
state.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
here's
a
controversy
would
immediately
arise
at
that
point
and
actual
interference
with
the
appellant's
operation
would
occur
at
that
moment.
a
threat
of
arrest
would
create
such
a
controversy.
mr.
john
fourt
notwithstanding
that
the
appellee
would
have
no
protection
under
state
law
at
that
time.
nevertheless,
appellee
has
done
nothing
to
prevent
the
appellant
from
doing
anything
he
wishes
to.
if
the
appellant
does
anything
more,
something
may
happen.
but
at
that
moment,
nothing
has
happened.
that
moment,
this
notice
was
given
to
him.
mr.
john
fourt
that
he
is
being
warned
that
this
lot
constitutes
a
public
nuisance
and
it's
subject
to
--
for
abatement
proceedings
in
the
superior
court.
at
that
moment,
as
we
construe
california
law,
he
is
not
subject
to
arrest.
not
subject
to
an
action
for
civil
penalties,
not
subject
to
an
action
for
injunction
to
prevent
if
moving
the
lot.
at
that
moment,
nothing
has
happened.
he
is
not
in
violation
of
law,
he
is
subject
to
proceedings
to
be
inaugurated
by
the
enforcement
officer.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
but
that
is
not
the
appellees'
action.
that
is
the
action
of
the
statute.
he
is
describing
informing
the
appellants
what
the
statute
provides.
mr.
john
fourt
he
is
offending
the
statute,
may
it
please
the
court,
not
the
appellees'
actions
or
orders.
now,
it
may
be
that
this
is
enough
to
constitute
a
case
of
controversy,
but
we
do
not
believe
it
does
at
that
moment.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
that
until
something
more
is
given,
some
more
action
is
taken
by
the
appellee,
that
then
there
is
no
personal
grievance
between
the
parties
before
the
court
and
that
this
is
representational
action
against
the
appellee
as
a
representative
of
the
state
of
california
in
this
violation
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
perhaps
even
more
so,
we
commenced
the
enforcement
procedure
when
the
avocados
were
inspected.
then,
the
next
step
was
giving
of
the
notice.
the
next
step
if
the
appellants
had
not
transshipped
would
have
been
abatement
procedures
or
some
other
enforcement
action.
mr.
john
fourt
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
as
a
convenience
to
the
industry,
the
industry,
both
appellants
and
the
california
handlers,
desire
to
comply
with
california
law
that
they
just
get
into
unnecessary
difficulty
if
they
can't
easily
and
conveniently
abide
with
the
law.
this
is
a
courtesy
notice
to
them.
from
our
viewpoint,
it
is
necessary
because
of
limited
enforcement
in
them.
mr.
john
fourt
that
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
we
do
not
interpret
this
provision.
ordinarily,
the
person
in
possession
of
the
lot
is
a
truck
driver
or
the
handler
for
example
--
mr.
john
fourt
oh,
yes.
that
is
correct.
but
this
signature
provision
is
to
make
sure
that
the
person
in
possession,
not
necessarily
the
owner
of
the
lot,
acknowledged
that
he
received
the
notice.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
if
the
truck
driver
will
do
so,
then
that
solves
the
problem
as
far
as
the
california
enforcement
authorities
are
concerned.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
we
view
the
same
facts
slightly
differently.
we
believe
this
had
been
a
restatement
of
statute
--
the
california
statute
and
we
are
merely
informing
the
appellants
of
the
content
of
that
statute.
now,
the
court
views
it
as
a
definite
threat
that
this
will
occur
by
the
appellee
and
we
just
need
to
--
mr.
john
fourt
it
is
hypothetical,
what
would
have
occurred.
mr.
john
fourt
in
order
to
suggest
to
him
that
he
cull
the
fruit
or
divert
it
out
of
state.
mr.
john
fourt
a
misdemeanor
criminal
prosecution
and
action
for
a
civil
penalties
where
the
civil
penalty
maybe
$100
to
$500
for
each
violation,
an
action
for
injunction
to
prevent
future
violations,
seizure
of
the
lot
together
with
abatement
proceedings
filed
in
the
state
court.
mr.
john
fourt
no,
we
assume,
he
will
believe
that
and
we
--
that
--
so
that
is
a
fact.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
the
point
is
that
that
representation
is
made
by
the
statute
not
by
the
appellee.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
the
court
should
not
assume
that
the
california
officers
will
enforce
an
unconstitutional
law.
they
are
under
obligation
to
comply
with
federal
law
as
well
as
state
law.
mr.
john
fourt
he
should
if
he
--
mr.
john
fourt
well,
that
is
indeed
expecting
a
high
degree
of
duty.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
since
1925.
mr.
john
fourt
no,
no.
except
to
point
out
that
as
to
these
appellants,
they
did
not
commence
marketing
avocados
in
california
since
--
until
1954.
so
that,
only
in
1954,
1955,
1956
and
1957,
has
the
california
officials
encountered
a
problem
of
avocados
imported
into
the
state
from
florida.
mr.
john
fourt
no,
perhaps,
my
answer
to
justice
brennan
yesterday
might
lead
to
that
inference.
the
reason
that
this
appellants
have
a
--
or
more
successful
of
marketing
avocados
in
california
than
the
california
handlers
is
because
as
appellants
state
in
their
complaint,
they
have
made
extreme
efforts
to
comply
with
california
law.
and
that
perhaps
undoubtedly
is
not
true
of
the
california
handlers.
our
position
is
the
statute
is
neutral.
mr.
john
fourt
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
fourt
none.
mr.
john
fourt
in
the
absence
of
statute,
as
we
construe
the
order
--
or
this
notice,
the
notice
would
be
valid,
that
is
unlawful.
that
is
the
notice
of
itself
imposes
no
sanction
on
the
appellants,
the
notice
of
itself
does
not
interfere
with
the
appellants'
marketing
of
avocados
in
california.
mr.
john
fourt
that
fact
was
present
by
virtue
of
the
statute
standing
on
the
books,
if
in
lieu
of
this
notice,
we
could
just
seize
the
avocados
or
file
some
type
of
litigation
against
the
appellants
to
punish
them
for
doing
something
in
violation
of
state
law.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
our
position
is
that
that
is
also
informational
and
that
the
appellants
are
notified
which
avocados
comply
with
state
law
and
which
avocados
do
not.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
the
action
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
it
is
the
latter
argument
that
--
that
insofar
as
the
record
in
this
case
is
concerned,
there
is
no
case
that
counters
his
submission
to
justify
a
court
inquiring
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct
for
a
threat,
an
actual
threat.
a
statement
by
an
officer
of
that
such
would
occur,
personally
that
is
that
the
officer
would
do
so.
mr.
john
fourt
a
direct
threat
saying,
“do
this
or
you
would
be
arrested
or
do
this
or
i
will
seize
the
lot.”
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
it
may
well
be.
if
so
then,
a
case
of
controversy
exists.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
as
--
mr.

that

said
they
market
a

at
most,
all
that
the
appellants
desire
here
is
to
rearrange

present
distribution
of

the
direct
appeal
is
to
show
that
the
appellants
at
any
time
had
been
charged
with
a
crime
or
a
judicial
action
has
been
brought
against
them.
we
believe
that
these
facts
are
now
at
least
to
the
facts
in

company
which
involved
a
retail
sales
dealer,

dealer

and
the
state
law
to
which
he
was
objecting

the
manner
in
which
he
operates
his
business,
that
is,
granting
discounts
and
full
disclosure
to
the
purchases
of
automobiles.
this
court
pointed
out
that
he
was
not
put
out
of
business
by
the
statute
and
that
he
--
there
was
no
serious
interference
with
his
business.
therefore,
that
the
district
court,
although
it
passed
on
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
state
statute,
in
the
effect,
abused
his
discretion
in
not
passing
on
its
equitable
jurisdiction
first.
to
state
a
case
in
equity
in
a
case
of
this
action,
appellants
must
show
that
the
interference
by
the
state
statute
is
indeed
serious.
if
the
court
finds
that
this
interference
is
not
a
sufficient
gravity
to
justify
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
an
injunction,
then,
we
suggest
that
the
court
may
wish
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
with
a
request
that
the
district
court
consider
its
appellant's
--
its
equitable
jurisdiction
to
see
if
appellant's
case
does
state
a
case
in
equity.
however,
we
feel
that
on
this
case
which
on
the
record
is
complete
here
that
the
lack
of
equity
is
so
strong
that
the
court
as
it
did
in
spielman
may
wish
to
reverse
with
instructions
to
dismiss
on
the
---
for
the
grounds
of
lack
of
equity.
