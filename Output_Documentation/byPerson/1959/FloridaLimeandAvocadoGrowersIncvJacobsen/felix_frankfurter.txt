justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
have
you
--
have
you
finished
your
discussion
of
our
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
said
anything
about
the
lemke
case
is
relevant
in
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
yes
--
suppose
a
statute
violated
the
commerce
clause
just
as
you're
attacking
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
point
--
the
whole
point
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
this
court,
and
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
they
were
sitting
on
that
court
at
least
three
justices
who
had
special
competence
in
the
field
of
jurisdiction.
justice
brennan,
justice
day
and
brandeis,
the
whole
point
was
that
there
was
a
constitutional
question,
a
clear
constitutional
question.
there
was
also
a
claim
that
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
north
dakota
grain
statute
would
appeal
to
the
federal
grain
statute.
but
before
you
got
to
that,
you
have
to
consider
both
the
federal
statute
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
construe
the
north
dakota
statute.
and
that
case
hold
that
any
holdings
can
be
clear
and
unequivocal
that
unless
there
is
an
exclusively
constitutional
question,
you
can't
come
here
directly.
that's
what
that
case
--
that
you
can
go
rather
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
can't
come
here
directly.
you
must
go
through
the
court
of
appeals.
isn't
that
true?
am
i
wrong
about
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
enumerated
these
many,
many
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
are
they
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
parker
against
brown,
when
you
say
that
this
court,
with
all
your
reading
of
the
cases,
practically
never
decide
the
question
of
jurisdiction
sub
silentio.
it
often
does
so
and
passed
on
itself
from
the
day
with
chief
justice
marshall.
he
overruled
the
case
in
which
they
did
decide
jurisdiction
sub
silentio
and
said
so.
that
it
was
decided
sub
silentio
and
therefore
wasn't
given
attention
and
therefore
they
reexamined
it
and
found
they
were
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
parker
and
brown?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
discussed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
jurisdictional
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
read
--
you
read
the
question
we
put
on
the
--
in
putting
the
case
down
for
rehearing
and
unless
my
ears
betray
me,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
that
isn't
discussion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
consideration.
that
is
in
the
multitude
of
cases
that
come
before
the
court
with
more
than
once.
we
will
not
focus
our
attention
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
must
--
you
must,
i
think,
contend
that
the
lemke
case
has
been
overruled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
true
here.
in
one
phase
of
the
case,
there
is
no
constitutional
question
in
the
sense
that
you
must
construe
the
california
statute
before
you
reach
the
supremacy
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
say
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
we
ever
invalidate
a
state
statute
on
the
ground
of
preemption,
we
must
construe
what
the
scope
of
the
state
statute
is
or
take
the
state
court's
view
it
or
construe
the
scope
of
the
federal
question
or
the
implementing
regulation
that
the
chief
justice's
question
is
indigent.
the
--
the
marketing
act
doesn't
deal
at
all
with
oil
content
as
such,
that's
corrected
either.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
you
must
construe
whether
the
fact
that
the
marketing
agreement
doesn't
deal
at
all
with
oil
content
whether
that's
the
plan's
entirely
the
right
of
the
state
to
deal
with
it.
we
must
construe
what
the
scope
of
that
is
before
we
get
to
your
constitutional
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
disagree
with
you
at
all.
but
that
general
proposition
doesn't
deal
with
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case
or
had
in
lemke
case,
namely,
before
you
decide
that
the
state
statute
has
overruled
it
and
has
overturned
it,
you
must
construe
both
the
state
statute
and
the
federal
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you're
wrong.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
lemke
is
flat
the
other
way
and
you
must
contend
that
that
case
must
be
overruled
and
should
be
overruled
explicitly
if
that's
--
if
it
has
been
overruled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
can't
speak
for
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
true
here,
as
i've
said
three
times.
it's
true
here
that
before
you
get
to
the
supremacy
clause,
you
must
get
to
the
construction,
the
scope,
the
meaning,
the
applicability,
call
it
what
you
will,
of
the
california
law
and
the
federal
act
of
1937
if
it's
1937.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
saying
no
more
than
--
that
lemke
decides
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
wasn't.
it
was
decided
and
heard
by
three
judges
upon
filing
its
bill
complainant
move
for
a
temporary
injunction
which
application
was
heard
before
three
federal
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
lemke
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
for
the
lemke
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
258
u.s.
at
page
52.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
page
52.
that's
the
page
on
which
the
sentence
appears
which
i
quoted.
the
initial
page
is
50.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
there
was.
the
court
denied
this
motion.
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed.
the
court
denied
it.
the
motion
granted
a
temporary
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
see
how
that's
--
in
this
remotest
way
affect
this
problem
because
under
the
266,
the
defense
was
you
have
to
have
three
judges
to
grant
a
temporary
injunction.
and
that
the
statute
that
mr.
justice
douglas
says
was
later
amended
so
as
to
require
also
three
judges
to
grant
a
permanent
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
take
your
time.
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
problem.
and
you
don't
want
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
there
are
such
scores
of
cases
if
you
let
me
say
so
and
to
the
extent
that
there
are,
they
weren't
considered.
that
does
not
constitute
a
lemke
case
and
for
myself,
i
would
not
overrule
it
because
i
don't
think
i
would
overrule
a
procedural
decision
that
i
stood
all
this
time
untouched
except
when
--
when
the
court
has
inevitable
human
institution
hasn't
heeded
that
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
suggestion
of
discriminatory
treatment
of
the
home
market?
i
mean
in
the
pleading,
is
one
of
the
claims
on
the
basis
of
which
an
injunction
is
sought
is
equal
--
probably
suggested
that
they
treat
discriminatorily,
favorably
the
home
market
as
against
the
florida
market?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
it
explicitly
said
that
the
inspectors
and
so
on
shut
their
eyes
to
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
whether
that's
--
that's
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
allegation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
do
not
contest
the
operation.
does
that
mean
they
do
not
contest
the
operation
of
the
inspection
procedure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
there
a
suggestion
that
the
oil
test
is
not
applied
to
california
when
in
fact
it
is
applied
to
florida?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean
by
the
equal
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may.
it
may
raise
a
constitutional
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
am
not
sure
(inaudible)
justice
whittaker
was
if
merely
it
was
--
if
the
sole
issue
of
the
constitutional
question,
then
there
must
be
a
three-judge
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
that
if
--
if
a
non-constitutional
question
whether
--
and
in
parker
and
brown
of
the
(inaudible)
but
if
--
if
there's
a
non-constitutional
question
which
initially
calls
for
a
statutory
construction
as
to
the
scope
of
the
local
statute
and
or
the
scope
of
the
federal
statute
then
you
say
since
local
matters
may
determine
the
issue,
local
judges
(inaudible)
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
that
is
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
haven't
--
we
haven't
decided,
have
we,
mr.
fourt?
this
court
has
not
yet
decided,
what
the
answer
as
to
justice
whittaker's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
not
yet
decided.
we
have
decided
in
lemke.
and
that's
what
lemke
decided
that
when
there
is,
as
they
set
forth
and
as
the
opinions
of
the
--
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
makes
clear
and
just
to
say
that
one,
an
attack
under
the
commerce
clause,
that
too
along,
there'd
be
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
two,
in
conflict
with
the
federal
grain
inspection
act,
then
they
held
that
it's
(inaudible)
come
of
him,
you
can
go
to
the
--
you
should
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
point
is
emphasizing
that
case
by
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
was
joined
by
two
others.
the
court,
throughout
the
statute,
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
justice
brandeis
sort
of
concurring
opinion
not
invalidating
the
statute
but
merely
saying
that
some
provisions
of
the
statute
leaving
the
rest
of
the
statute
are
in
conflict,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
remember
it,
the
earlier
statute
of
this
court
obligatory
jurisdiction
gave
a
direct
review
from
the
district
court.
this
is
before
the
three-judge
regarding
this
(inaudible)
gave
a
direct
review
to
this
court
from
the
judgment
of
a
district
court
when
there
was
a
declaration
--
adjudication
of
unconstitutionality.
and
this
court
said
that
that
would
mean
that
every
constitutional
question
can
be
brought
and
come
here
only
if
it's
exclusively
(inaudible)
if
it
found
it
was
(inaudible)
then
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
--
i
think
you
want
to
elaborate
what
you
said
earlier
that
this
was
a
question
of
construction
and
bearing
on
the
construction
in
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question,
wouldn't
you
call
on
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute?
that
this
concerned
with
congress
didn't
have
this
kind
of
problem
before
it.
it
had
outright
invalidation
of
state
statute
and
that's
all
that
was
involved.
and
that's
why
this
statute
was
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
fair
to
say,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
under
your
view,
a
single
judge
may
invalidate
the
state
statute
if
he
finally
reaches
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
after
having
passed
on
the
questions
of
statutory
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
say,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
that
the
question?
that's
the
whole
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
read
jurisdictional
words
literally.
this
court
has
again
and
again
construed
words
that
literally
mean
one
thing
and
in
the
light
of
the
basis
on
which
it
was
passed
mean
a
quite
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
several
times.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
are
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
bill
--
are
there
no
allegations
in
the
bill
from
which
one
can,
by
a
reasonable
intendment,
bind
that
these
appellants'
complaints
that
they
are
shippers
of
avocados
in
florida,
they
have
been
shipping
them,
that
they
want
to
ship
them
in
the
future
and
they
will
be
subject
to
what
they
claim
as
an
unconstitutional
statute.
are
there
no
such
allegations
in
the
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
isn't
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
no
allegations
saying
that
they
will
--
state
officials
will
enforce
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
sanctions
for
your
act?
what
is
--
what
are
the
consequences
of
disobedience?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
assumption
of
your
argument
is
that
the
appellant
is
not
just
divided
in
thinking
that
one
of
those
proceedings,
at
least
one,
would
be
started
against
him.
isn't
that
the
assumption
of
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
not
--
then
that
is
reasonably
and
hypothetically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
may
not
assume
that
the
law
enforcing
authorities
of
california
neither
enforce
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
where
is
the
--
what's
the
line,
what's
the
gap?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
the
local
district
attorney
or
city
solicitor
or
whatever
it's
called
or
the
person
who
brings
(inaudible)
proceeding
will
establish
that
as
a
law,
and
our
decisions
decide
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
therefore
would
not
enforce
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
expecting
--
they're
not
expecting
a
little
too
much?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
suggestion
that
california
law
enforcement
authorities
would
be
more
lenient
to
floridian
rather
than
california?
