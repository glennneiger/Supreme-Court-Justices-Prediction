justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
do
you
recondition
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
would
be
destroyed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
not
to
pay
or
reconditioned
but
they
are
culled.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
throughout
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
mind
telling
us
that
claim?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
the
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
in
that
case,
you
would
go
to
what
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
decided
the
case
on
the
other
court
of
appeals,
namely,
(inaudible)
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
if
it
would
come
here
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
a
question
of
constitutionality
of
state
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
can
that
be
avoided?
(inaudible)
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
state
statute,
a
three-judge
(inaudible)
three-judge
court
could
possibly
convene,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
one
(inaudible)
is
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
state
statute
--
three-judge
court.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
what
--
and
that
you
claim
that
make
such
charge
but
also
makes
an
independent
charge
that
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
(inaudible)
a
three-judge
court
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
a
single
judge
court
could
declare
a
state
statute
to
be
unconstitutional?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
could
congress
be
much
more
plain
than
it
has
been
in
2281
saying
that
no
injunction
against
any
state
statute
shall
be
granted
by
any
district
court
or
judge
thereof
upon
the
ground
of
unconstitutionality
of
such
statute
unless
the
application
therefore
is
heard
and
determined
by
a
district
court
of
three
judges?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
--
that
might
be.
but
suppose
he
does
not
hold
on
the
question
of
statutory
construction
against
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff,
but
he
does
on
the
question,
the
other
second
question
of
unconstitutionality
of
state
statute,
now,
then,
where
does
the
appeal
go?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
although
all
that's
involved
is
a
holding
denying
a
--
an
injunction
against
the
operation
of
the
state
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
298?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
quite
correct,
mr.
fourt,
when
congress
has
the
right
to
fix
the
jurisdiction
of
the
inferior
federal
courts
and
it
has
by
2281
said
that
no
federal
court
shall
enjoin
the
--
the
--
shall
--
yes,
determine
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
state
statute
except
by
a
court
of
three
judges?
section
2281
title
28.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
doesn't
that
fix
the
jurisdiction
and
make
the
matter
jurisdictional?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
why
not
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
only
one
type
of
court
has
power
under
the
statute,
namely,
a
three-judge
court.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i'm
just
reading
the
words
as
they
appear
in
the
statutes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
may
i
ask
you
this?
enter
a
new
judgment
period
or
enter
new
judgment
to
attack?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
must
we
ask
one
last
question
and
i
swear
this
is
it.
[laughter]
that's
(inaudible)
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
words
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit.
they
say
there's
no
merit
to
the
local
(inaudible)
but
there
is
as
to
the
claim
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
state
statute
because
of
(inaudible)
under
the
commerce
clause.
now,
a
one
judge
court
makes
such
judgment,
can
that
stand
under
this
section
22
that
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
2281?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
my
point.
that
--
all
that's
left
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
constitutional
issue.
they
affirm
one
judge
court.
can
they
do
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
suppose
the
law
is
invalid
and
violates
the
federal
constitution,
would
you
say
that
--
that
they
made
under
those
circumstances
wouldn't
--
couldn't
be
utilized
on
the
basis
of
our
suit
against
the
officer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
about
a
stretch
to
take
his
property
and
unless
he
abides
by
law
that
we
are
assumed
unconstitutional?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
this
is
for
--
(inaudible)
notice
to
him
that
his
possessions
are
both
unlawful
acts?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he
had
no
constitutional
basis
under
that
statute,
then,
is
he
not
personally
offending?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that.
there
was
no
--
this
was
therefore
effective
statute,
an
enactment
of
the
state
without
extent?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
mean
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
or
sale
of
those
lots
will
be
illegal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
unlawful
for
him
to
move
them.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
we've
already
observed
that
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
marketing
act
points
(inaudible)
constitutional
question
here
that
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
