director
of

of
the
state
of

mr.
ferguson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
federal
regulations,
mr.
ferguson,
affects
the
--
the
oil
content
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
regulations.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
california
says
it
must
have
8%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
comparable
regulation
on
the
same
--
on
the
same
subject
matter
in
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
appellees'
brief.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
they
ever
had
any
--
any
procedure
for
doing
it?
have
they
ever
tried
to
recondition
them
as
the
term
is
used?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
when
--
when
the
state
has
challenged
them
and
you
spoke
of
12
instances
where
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
have
been
challenged.
now,
i
wonder
if
any
of
those,
there
--
there
has
been
any
so-called
reconditioning
the
process
engaged
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
abatement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
just
hadn't
been
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
repacking
in
some
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
some
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
might
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
in
avocados,
it
couldn't
be
done
per
se.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fourt,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
there
been
inspection
of
california
avocados
to
accomplish
that
result?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i
say
there
--
has
there
been
a
--
a
testing
program
going
along
--
i
--
as
i
--
as
i
understand
that
most
of
the
avocados
that
are
used
out
in
california
are
--
are
raised
in
california.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
those
california
avocados
been
tested
since
1925
as
a
matter
of
procedure
to
--
to
see
that
they
are
--
contain
8%
or
more
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
--
they
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
do
not
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.

number

&
avocado
growers,
inc.,
appellants
versus
jacobsen,
director
of
the
department
of
agriculture
of
california.
mr.
fourt,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
fourt,
didn't
you
actually
start
the
process
of
enforcement
in
this
statute
against
the
--
the
appellant
in
motion
when
you
served
this
notice
upon
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
definitely,
that
was
the
first
step
in
the
procedure
of
abatement,
and
he
may
--
it
may
be
that
he
would
have
to
take
some
other
step
or
do
something
or
not
do
something
before
you
would
take
a
second
one
but
you
did
actually
start
the
abatement
proceeding
in
motion,
did
you
not,
when
you
served
this
prerequisite
order
on
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
suppose,
this
notice
is
a
prerequisite
to
the
--
the
judicial
proceeding
of
abatement,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
do
it
without
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
state
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
would
have
been
--
then
you
have
benn
enforcing
since
the
1920s,
haven't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
wouldn't
enforce
it,
where
they
have
been
enforcing
it
for
almost
40
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
your
main
argument
mr.
fourt?
do
you
--
do
you
want
to
be
in
the
position
always
as
a
result
of
this
case,
so
that
you
can
say
that
when
you
--
when
you
send
people
notices
of
this
kind,
that
you
are
not
enforcing
the
act
of
california
or
--
or
is
it
your
main
argument
that
--
that
the
act
is
constitutional?
is
this
a
make
way
argument
or
--
or
what?
are
you
interested
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
or
--
or
in
this
particular
procedure,
so
that
you
can
proceed
at
least
this
far
at
all
times
with
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
you
would
want
him
either
to
be
arrested,
but
you
would
want
his
property
actually
seized
as
a
matter
of
--
of
procedure
before,
before
he
can
get
any
relief
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
the
notice
tantamount
to
that?

justice
earl
warren
mr.
ferguson.
