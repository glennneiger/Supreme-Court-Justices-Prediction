mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
correct
what
i
think
is
a
--
been
a
misapprehension
all
the
way
through,
both
in
my
earlier
briefs
and
in
the
government.
this
tax
is
not
on
the
proceeds
of
the
insurance
in
any
sense.
it
is
a
tax
on
the
assets
of
the
estate
which
are
in
the
hands
of
the
executor,
to
the
executor
and
the
executor
is
required
to
pay
the
tax.
true,
he
has
a
rather
converse
right
of
a
--
to
pursue
against
the
insured
--
against
the
beneficiary
of
the
insurance,
but
that
is
all.
he
is
the
one
who
pays
the
tax
and
he
pays
the
tax,
because
the
statute
orders
him
to.
section
810
of
the
code
of
1939
and
that
section
of
the
code,
orders
him
to
do
so
because
he
is
in
possession
of
the
so
called
probate
estate
and
there's
a
man
that
can
pay
it.
that's
the
first
point.
the
next
point
is
that
as
has
been
pointed
out,
this
is
a
new
question.
the
payer
of
the
premium
tests
flatly
and
solely,
has
never
been
before
this
court
before.
insurance
has
been
held
imputable
under
the
state,
where
the
beneficiary
retained
rights
of
incidents
of
ownership,
but
never
before
has
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
payment
of
premium
test
been
before
the
court.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
yes.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
well,
it
had
been
a
matter
of
regulation
before
that.
payment
of
the
premium
test
had
been
in
--
mr.
langley
assigned
these
policies
to
his
wife
in,
i
think,
january
of
1930
--
december
of
1935
or
1936.
in
march
of
that
same
year
at
that
time,
the
payment
of
premium
test
was
in.
in
march
of
that
year,
the
payment
of
premium
test
was
removed,
that
was
1937.
then
in
1941,
by
a
treasury
decision,
it
was
returned.
then
in
1942,
the
19
--
the
act
of
1942,
amended
the
code
and
put
the
payment
of
premium
test
in
the
1939
code.
that
remained
there
until
the
death
of
the
testator
in
july
of
1954
and
the
new
code
went
into
effect
in
august
of
1954.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
or
even
--
probably
be
disputed
by
the
government,
the
proceeds
of
these
policies
form
no
portion
of
the
estate
of
the
decedent.
if
there
should
be
any
doubt
on
that
subject,
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
bess.
that
was
a
case
where
it
was
sought
to
enforce
an
income
--
a
lien
to
--
for
in
collectionof
an
income
tax
against
the
decedent,
who
had
died
leaving
insurance.
the
government
sought
to
argue
that
under
the
1939
code,
section
3670,
there
was
a
lean
on
the
proceeds
of
the
insurance
for
the
--
which
could
be
used
to
enforce
collection
from
the
income
tax
and
it
did
not
succeed.
this
curtail
that
was
not
the
case.
to
state,
it
would
be
anomalous
to
view
his
party
subject
to
lien,
proceeds
never
within
the
insurance
reached
to
enjoy
which
are
reducible
possession
by
another
only
upon
his
death.
now,
i
don't
want
to
go
into
that,
but
--
too
far,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
a
slightest
question
anywhere.
but
these
proceeds
are
no
part
of
his
estate.
and
his
death
now,
it's
been
pointed
out
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
it's
perhaps
not
as
strict
--
the
estate
tax
has
applied
to
situations
which
were
perhaps
not
strictly
transfers.
that
is
joint
property,
or
trust
in
which
the
settler
reserved
the
right
to
income
as
our
point
and
things
like
that.
but
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
something
has
been
terminated
by
the
death
of
the
owner
or
something
--
some
right
in
property
has
been
terminated
by
death.
and
it
has
been
held
that
that
makes
it
includible
in
the
probate
estate.
in
this
case,
nothing
was
terminated
by
death.
on
the
contrary,
something
was
created
that
is
the
debt
of
the
insurance
company
to
the
insured,
i
mean
to
the
beneficiary.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
may
i
--
going
to
that
just
a
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
that
i
think
the
leading
case
on
that
subject
perhaps
is
the
old
case
of
chase
national
bank
against
the
united
states.
that
was
the
case
where
a
decedent
with
insurance
on
his
life
in
which
he
retained
all
of
the
incidents
of
ownership.
it
was
included
in
his
estate
for
estate
tax
purposes
and
i
think
the
assertion
was
the
same
as
here
that
that
was
unconstitutional,
as
a
direct
tax.
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
held
that
the
proceeds
in
that
case
could
be
included,
but
it
was
very
careful
to
explain
why
it
held
it.
if
i
may
read
just
two
sentences,
this
after
speaking
of
the
fact
that
the
insured
have
retained
incidents
of
ownership,
the
court
said,
“the
precise
question
presented
is
whether
the
termination
at
death
of
that
power
and
the
consequent
passing
to
this
designated
beneficiaries
of
all
rights
under
the
policies
freed
in
the
possibility
that's
exercised,
maybe
the
legitimate
subject
of
a
transfer
tax.
as
it
is
true,
the
termination
by
death
of
any
of
the
other
legal
incidents
of
property,
through
which
it's
used
for
economic
enjoyment
may
be
controlled.”
what
is
being
taxed
is
the
termination
of
the
right
of
the
insured
to
control
the
policy
then
later
on,
when
it
comes
to
the
evaluation
of
this
policy,
in
the
same
case
on
page
339,
the
court
said,
“as
it
is
the
termination
of
the
power
of
disposition
of
the
policies
by
decedent
at
death,
which
operates
as
an
effective
transfer
and
is
subject
to
the
tax,
there
can
be
no
objection
to
measuring
a
tax
or
fixing
its
right
by
including
in
the
gross
estate
the
value
of
the
policies
at
the
time
of
the
death,
together
with
the
other
interest
of
decedent
facts
where
at
his
death.”
in
other
words,
in
all
insurance
cases
to
this
death
up
to
this
date,
what
has
been
taxed
is
a
termination
of
the
rights
of
the
incidents
of
ownership
of
the
insured
in
his
policies.
the
proceeds
of
the
policies
have
not
been
included.
they
have
merely
been
used
to
value
these
rights
which
were
retained
by
the
decedent.
so
this
is
the
first
time,
i
believe,
that
this
court
has
ever
had
boldly
and
nakedly
before
it,
the
payment
of
premium
test.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so,
because
it's
been
held
by
this
court
in
many
cases
and
i
have
no
dispute
about
it
that
the
termination
of
the
right
of
a
decedent
with
regard
to
some
property
warrants
the
inclusion
of
that
property
or
may
warrant
the
inclusion
of
that
property
in
his
estate
for
tax
purposes.
for
instance,
where
there
is
a
trust
in
which
they
settler
retains
the
right
to
income
during
his
life.
his
death
terminates
that
right
and
the
entire
purpose
of
the
trust
is
to
be
valued
in
his
estate
and
the
same
thing
in
the
general
power
of
appointment.
that
is
a
little
different.
i
think
a
more
difficult
case
is
frankly,
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
gift
mortis
causa.
that
would
be
included
in
the
estate.
that
is
the
man
in
contemplation
of
death,
gives
his
son
$100,000
and
it
is
in
contemplation
of
death
and
he
lives
a
couple
of
years
that
will
be
in
his
estate.
that
is
a
little
bit
going
near
the
point,
but
it
still
comes
within
--
what
i'm
going
to
say
about
what
the
government
has
done.
it
is
still
a
transfer
in
contemplation
of
death,
just
a
transfer
mortis
causa,
just
as
on
the
other
transfer
and
that
comes
within
the
warding
of
the
statutes
and
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
say
where
a
man
has
transferred
something
and
that
transfer
has
been
caused
by
his
death,
because
that
by
hypothesis,
is
what
the
transfer
mortis
causa
means.
when
a
man
has
made
a
transfer
mortis
causa,
and
that's
--
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
say
that
the
--
it's
the
same
thing
when
something
has
been
freshly
created
by
his
death
over
which
he
had
no
power,
that
is
the
proceeds
of
the
insurance,
no
interest,
no
power,
or
control
at
all.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
well
--
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
every
time
anybody
pays
a
--
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
--
premium
on
his
policy
of
insurance,
he
is
making
a
transfer
in
contemplation
of
death
--
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
--
in
a
sense.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
--
but
does
not
--
excuse
me.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
i
say
excuse
me.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
taxed.
i
mean
the
statute
doesn't
cover.
that's
all.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
it
doesn't.
i
didn't
say
it
couldn't,
i
said
it
doesn't.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
would
like
to
come
to
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
[laughs]
i
don't
intend
to
take
too
much
of
the
time,
but
justice
frankfurter,
what
you
said,
that
is
essentially
what
this
statute
does.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
--
i
don't
think
that's
--
that's
the
case.
we
have
been
hearing
and
quoting
from
section
811
of
the
1939
code,
which
makes
--
tells
what
is
to
be
taxed.
section
810
tells
what
the
tax
is.
a
tax
equal
to
the
sum
of
(inaudible)
on
the
transfer
of
another
state.
now,
it's
on
the
transfer
and
so
far
as
the
1939
code
goes,
unless
there's
a
transfer,
there
is
no
tax.
section
811
is
not
--
nothing
to
do
with
the
transfer.
it
has
to
do
with
the
inclusion
and
valuation
of
the
various
items
of
the
estate
and
every
item
of
the
estate
is
taken
--
every
item
is
taken
care
of.
in
the
first
paragraph,
all
property
of
every
kind
and
nature
and
in
the
following
paragraphs,
various
items
of
a
sort
that
have
been
mentioned,
joint
property,
general
powers
of
appointment,
trusts
of
various
sorts.
but
in
every
one
of
those,
some
right
of
the
decedent
terminates.
when
we
come
to
the
payment
of
premiums,
nothing
terminates,
but
instead,
something
is
created.
nothing
is
transferred
whatsoever.
the
tax
is
on
the
transfer
of
the
various
assets
of
the
estate
which
had
been
designated
otherwise
by
the
statute
in
the
various
other
sections.
this
section
stands
alone
and
when
there's
a
tax
because
of
the
proceeds,
life
insurance,
because
the
tax
was
paid
on.
that
is
no
transfer
at
all.
let's
admit
it,
that's
a
lot
of
transfer.
and
the
tax
on
the
transfer
of
the
other
assets
of
the
estate
is
taken
cared
of
more
other
sections
of
the
statute.
so
this
stands
out
simply
like
this,
so
our
thumbs,
it's
something
different
from
any
other
section
of
the
statute.
now,
it's
perfectly
possible.
oh,
well,
this
is
simply
this
--
simply
fix
the
rates
of
tax
or
something
like
that.
my
position
is
that
it
does
not
simply
fix
the
rate
of
the
tax.
the
rate
of
the
tax
is
fixed
by
other
sections
of
the
statute
and
if
i
submit
respectfully,
sometimes,
it's
quite
important.
sometimes,
a
name
of
the
statute,
the
way
a
statute
is
designated
is
quite
important.
for
instance,
suppose
a
tax
had
been
levied
in
these
terms,
a
direct
tax
and
a
certain
amount
shall
be
levied
on
the
property
of
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
dying
after
this
date.
and
suppose
the
cash
to
be
received
from
that
tax
was
arithmetic
to
the
same
that
you'd
get
from
an
estate
tax.
isn't
it
perfectly
clear
that
because
of
that
designation,
that
tax
would
be
unconstitutional
or
take
the
two
recent
cases
of
railway
express
agency
versus
virginia,
in
the
first
of
those
cases,
if
my
memory
serves,
there
was
a
franchise
tax
on
the
right
to
do
business
based
on
the
business
of
the
insurance
company
through
and
to
and
out
of
virginia.
in
the
second
case,
i
believe,
the
tax
--
the
subject
of
the
tax
are
the
same,
business
through
and
to
or
out
of
virginia,
but
in
that
case,
it
was
stated
to
be
a
tax
in
lieu
of
the
tax
on
other
intangible
personal
property
and
rolling
stock.
that
tax
was
held
to
be
valid.
so
i
submit
that
when
we
get
to
these
fine
points
or
far
reaches
of
definition,
the
designation
of
the
statute
is
quite
important.
now,
this
statute
is
a
tax
on
transfers
and
the
transfer
and
valuation
of
every
other
asset
in
the
estate
has
been
otherwise
defined
by
the
statute
and
on
every
other
case,
there
has
been
something
that
has
been
transferred,
but
in
this
one
instance
of
the
proceeds
of
insurance
on
which
the
deceased
has
paid
the
premium,
there's
been
nothing
transferred
or
even
taking
stretching
transfer
as
a
proper,
stretching
the
word
transfer
so
far
as
to
include
determination
of
a
right.
something
has
been
created,
something
new.
now,
granted,
it
would
be
entirely
feasible
if
--
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
yes.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
well
--
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
see
that
point,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
i
--
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
--
there
has
been
a
--
every
other
case
--
a
transfer
that
is
taking
the
termination
of
the
management
power
of
the
control
as
a
transfer.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
well,
alright.
she
--
she
did
pay
the
--
alright,
he
did
pay
the
premium
and
he
is
subject
to
gift
tax
and
it
is
permissible
for
the
government,
if
it
wants
to,
to
tax
a
receipt
of
these
policies,
but
the
point
i'm
making
now
and
why
i
was
insisting
on
what
the
tax
says
is
that
they
haven't
done
it.they
haven't
done
it
--
and
by
this
act.
now,
that's
my
position.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
no.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
i.
armstrong,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
unless
the
court
has
(inaudible)
that's
all
i
have
to
say.
