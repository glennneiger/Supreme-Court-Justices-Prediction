all

and

(inaudible)
justice

whittaker
unfortunately,
the
accident
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose
the
--
wouldn't
that
subject
be
covered
by
gift
taxes,
if
it
were
an
inter
vivos
taxation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
those
made
in
contemplation
of
death?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
has
this
court
not
held
and
hasn't
defend
the
policy
of
the
commission
to
predicate
estate
taxes
upon
viewing
of
the
taxation
of
the
privilege
of
transferring
property
of
death?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
the
basis
really
of
your
defendants
here,
the
continued
payment
of
premiums
by
mr.
langley.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
this
--
for
our
information
now,
i'm
trying
to
understand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
this
had
been
a
paid
up
policy
which
mr.
langley
gave
out
right
to
his
wife,
then
the
fact
that
it
was
worth
much
less
at
that
time
than
death
benefits
would
be
immaterial,
would
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
each
time
he
made
payments,
after
january
10,
1941,
he
purchased
new
rights,
did
he
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
they
increased
the
--
the
amount
receivable
at
death
and
therefore,
you
say
that
the
amounts
of
insurance
proceeds
purchased
by
those
premiums
constituted
a
transfer
effective
at
death.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
mean
just
exactly
that.
you
mean
paid
after
the
gift
or
after
the
transfer,
don't
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
true
that
the
theory
of
all
of
those
is
that
they
are
not
consonant,
they
are
not
complete?
as
against
the
government,
they
are
--
they
are
not
powered?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
as
against
the
government
[laughs]
well
advised
and
thus
said
to
be
a
device
isn't
it?
evasions
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
argument
directed
to
the
theory
that
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
inter
vivos
gift
made
in
1936?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
armstrong,
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir,
is
not
that
the
case
in
every
situation
where
a
decedent
leaves
insurance
payable
to
a
specific
beneficiary?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
not
be
the
--
is
that
not
--
does
that
not
then
present
though
the
direct
tax
question
you
hear,
sir?
