justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kramer,
what
gave
rise
--
what's
the
date
of
this
provision?
it's
a
new
one,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
--
any
enlightenment,
if
you
have,
how
this
came
to
be
a
reasoning
for
the
statute
in
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i'm
telling
at
the
outset.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kramer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
infer
that
if
it
isn't
a
testamentary
disposition,
therefore,
it
must
be
a
direct
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
congratulate
you
on
beginnings
discussed,
what
is
or
is
not
a
direct
tax
without
even
so
much
as
referring
to
the
income
tax
cases.
i
think
that's
quite
an
achievement,
mr.
kramer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
had
any
discussions
since
then
that
matters,
any
extensive
discussion
of
what
is
a
name
--
or
a
direct
tax
can
seek
on
past
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
refer
justice
black
to
the
income
tax
case
discussion?
they're
only
250
pages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kramer,
of
what
you
said
--
i'm
--
i
infer
with
some
surprise
that
the
tax
court
does
bear
some
constitutionality.
now,
the
old
board
of
tax
appeals
did
not,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
tax
court
fairs
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
in
these
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
case
--
in
what
cases
has
this
court
seems
to
think
(inaudible)
cases
nullified
and
unconstitutional
federal
tax
measure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
your
courts
doing
what
about,
is
that
a
federal
or
a
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
both
cases
have
run
the
(inaudible)
of
criticism
at
the
time
since,
haven't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
the
coolidge
case
itself,
had
been
questioned
in
subsequent
cases
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
it
binney
against
long
that
--
on
which
justice
roberts
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
that
kind
of
a
problem,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
was
there
any
disclosure
why
congress
repealed
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
what
is
life
insurance?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
ask
an
irrelevant
question
or
attribute.
what
volume
of
litigation
is
depending
on
the
outcome
of
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
if
the
district
court
--
position
were
to
be
sustained
here,
that
the
claims
for
refund
are
even
those
that
are
outlaws
by
times.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
legislation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
argument
of
yours
has
happened
a
little
bit,
by
what
congress
didn't
have
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
are
rather
conventional
of
--
rather
conventional
--
related
testamentary
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
not
fair
--
isn't
not
fair
to
say
that
all
the
premiums
paid
are
(inaudible)
in
contemplation
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore

justice
felix
frankfurter
from
what
is

frankfurter
