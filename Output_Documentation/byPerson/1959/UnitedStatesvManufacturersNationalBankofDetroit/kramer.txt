mr.
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
as
a
direct
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.
sections
1252
and
2101,
from
a
judgment
of
the
eastern
district
court
of
the
district
court
of
michigan,
in
a
suit
brought
for
recovery
of
certain
federal
estate
taxes
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1346
(a)
(1).
the
district
court
held
the
provisions
in
question
of
the
federal
estate
tax
under
which
the
tax
was
levied,
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
this
particular
case.
the
sections
of
the
statute
involved
are
found
in
the
--
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
pages
27
and
29.
it's
section
811
(g)
(2)
(a)
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
as
amended
by
section
404
of
the
revenue
act
of
1942.
mr.
kramer
yes.
mr.
kramer
yes.
mr.
kramer
the
result
would
be
that
there
--
there
would
be
no
estate
--
the
insurance
proceeds,
in
question,
would
not
have
been
included
in
his
gross
estate.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
yes.
mr.
kramer
none
of
them
would
be.
mr.
kramer
premiums
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kramer
that
is
right.
the
reason
is
--
mr.
kramer
what
are
known
as
incidents
of
ownership?
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
if
he
had
died
after
sometime
in
august
1954,
the
effective
date
of
the
1954
act,
however,
he
died
before
then
and
under
the
1939
code
as
amendment
by
the
1942
act,
it
is
the
government's
contention
that
the
proceeds
in
question
aren't
--
in
fact,
it
is
conceding
that
if
the
1942
act
is
constitutional,
the
insurance
proceeds
are
included
in
his
gross
estate.
that
is
conceding.
the
facts
or
may
--
may
contained
in
the
--
in
a
stipulation
which
is
printed
in
the
record
on
pages
15
and
18.
he
died
--
the
decedent
here
died
testate,
july
15th,
1954,
just
before
the
effective
date
of
the
1954
act,
at
age
66.
the
taxpayer
here
is
his
executor.
in
his
estate
tax
return,
the
executor
included
the
total
proceeds
amounting
to
about
$126,000,
of
four
insurance
policies
on
his
life,
the
--
the
proceeds
being
payable
to
his
wife.
he,
as
the
decedent,
had
taken
out
all
of
these
policies
between
the
years
1953
and
1932.
on
december
18th,
1936,
he
made
an
absolute
outright
assignment
of
the
ownership
of
this
policy.
he
transferred
all
the
incidents
of
ownership
in
the
policy
to
his
wife
who
was
named
beneficiary.
he
gave
up
all
of
his
rights
in
the
policy
to
obtain
cash
surrender
value
to
obtain
loans
or
to
change
the
beneficiary.
his
--
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
that
was
done
in
december
18th,
1936.
the
assignment
is
printed
on
pages
18
and
19
of
the
record.
however,
that
is
--
mr.
kramer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kramer
well,
the
last
policy
was
taken
out
in
1932.
the
first
policy
in
1923
and
two
policies
were
taken
out
in
1927.
two
--
three
of
the
policies
are
for
--
were
for
a
face
amount
of
$25,000
each,
one
was
for
$50,000.
the
decedent
paid
all
the
premiums
on
the
policy
from
the
time
they
were
first
taken
out
until
he
died.
even
after
the
assignment
in
1936,
he
continued
to
pay
the
premiums
on
the
policy.
every
premium
that
was
paid
on
any
of
these
policies
was
paid
by
the
decedent.
like
the
present
time,
the
proceeds
are
held
by
the
insurer
under
an
option
chosen
by
the
widow
for
her
benefit
and
the
benefit
of
the
children.
when
the
internal
revenue
service
made
their
audit
of
this
estate
tax
return,
they
determined
that
a
refund
should
be
made
of
approximately
$7800
for
this
reason,
they
determined
that
since
he
had
assigned
these
policies
in
december
1936,
prior
to
january
10th,
1941,
then
it
followed
that
under
the
1942
act,
since
he
had
retained
no
incidents
of
ownership
in
the
policies
after
january
10th,
1941,
there
was
to
be
excluded
from
his
gross
estate
that
proportion
of
the
proceeds
of
the
policies,
a
little
less
than
one-half
which
represented
the
premiums
he
had
paid
prior
to
january
10th,
1941.
this
is
350.
mr.
kramer
he
paid
before
that
date.
mr.
kramer
excluded,
yes.
mr.
kramer
that
was
the
basis
of
the
refund
which
amounted
to
about
$7800.
there
was
excluded,
i
think,
roughly
about
$60,000
of
the
proceeds.
thereafter,
the
taxpayer
filed
a
refund
claim
with
the
service
asking
for
a
refund
based
upon
the
exclusion
of
the
remainder
of
the
proceeds.
in
other
words,
the
taxpayer
claimed
that
not
simply
part
of
the
proceeds,
but
all
the
proceeds
should've
been
excluded
from
the
gross
estate.
and
the
taxpayer
therefore,
claimed
an
additional
refund
of
a
little
less
than
$9000.
the
claim
was
rejected
and
the
taxpayer
then
brought
this
suit
in
the
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
asking
for
this
refund
on
the
ground
that
the
sections
of
the
statute
here
involved
were
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
taxpayer
argued
that
since
the
decedent
had
no
incident
of
ownership
in
the
policy
at
the
time
he
died,
therefore,
the
estate
tax
was
a
direct
tax
on
the
policy
proceeds.
as
a
direct
tax,
it
was
not
apportioned
and
therefore,
it
violated
article
i,
sections
2
and
9
of
the
constitution,
which
are
found
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
page
26.
by
a
subsequent
amendment
to
the
complaint,
the
taxpayer
raised
in
the
additional
argument,
namely,
that
the
statute
in
question
here
is
applied
in
his
case,
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
first,
because
it
was
discriminatory
in
operation
and
second,
because
it
was
retroact.
the
district
court
subsequently
entered
judgment
for
the
taxpayer
finding
his
statute
unconstitutional
reasoning
--
reasoning
that
there
was
no
transfer
of
the
property
involved
at
the
time
of
the
decedent's
death.
the
district
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
did
not
elaborate
its
reasoning
to
any
extent
because
it
said,
it
simply
adopted
as
its
own.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
somewhat
similar
case
kohl
against
the
united
states
226
f.2d
381,
which
is
cited
in
the
first
footnote
of
our
brief
on
page
4.
the
facts
in
the
kohl
case
were
somewhat
similar
though
not
entirely
similar,
particularly
in
connection
with
the
retroactive
feature
of
the
tax.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
kohl
case
had
there
found,
these
particular
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
in
the
1942
act,
unconstitutional
on
two
grounds.
first,
it
was
a
direct
unapportioned
tax
and
second,
it
violated
due
process
because
it
was
a
retroactive
tax.
mr.
kramer
at
no
time
has
there
been
any
dispute,
but
that
if
the
statute
is
constitutional,
it
does
cover
the
proceeds
of
the
policy.
it
has
never
been
in
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
taxpayer.
mr.
kramer
it
is
their
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
first,
that
there
is
no
transfer
here
to
be
the
subject
of
the
tax,
at
least,
no
transfer
at
the
time
of
death.
and
that
since
there
is
no
transfer
to
be
the
subject
of
the
tax,
the
tax
must
be
a
direct
tax
upon
the
proceeds
themselves,
a
direct
tax
upon
the
property.
and
since
it
is
a
direct
tax,
it
must
be
apportioned
and
it
has
not
been
apportioned.
mr.
kramer
well,
the
direct
word
of
the
statute
is
found
here
in
our
brief
on
page
27.
it
says,
“the
value
of
the
gross
estate
of
the
decedent
shall
be
in
--
determined
by
including
the
value
at
the
time
of
his
death,
of
all
property,
real,
personal,
tangible
or
intangible.”
then
dropping
down
to
(g)
(2),
“to
the
extent
of
the
amount
of
receivable
by
all
--
all
other
beneficiaries
as
insurance
under
policies
upon
the
life
of
the
decedent,
purchased
with
premiums
or
other
consideration,
paid
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
decedent
in
proportion
that
the
amount
shall
pay
theirs
to
the
total
premiums
paid
for
the
insurance.”
mr.
kramer
yes.
well,
the
date
of
this
provision
is
the
--
mr.
kramer
in
the
1942
act
which
was
adopted
october
21st,
1942.
mr.
kramer
yes.
mr.
kramer
the
first
federal
state
tax
that
is
the
original
federal
state
tax,
the
modern
one,
was
adopted
in
1960.
that
contained
no
specific
provision
of
all
dealing
with
insurance
proceeds.
then
the
1918
act,
for
the
first
time,
had
a
specific
provision
dealing
with
insurance
proceeds.
it
followed
a
--
it
made
a
fundamental
distinction
which
is
still
followed
today.
it
was
followed
in
1942
act.
between
policies,
the
proceeds
of
which
were
payable
to
the
executor,
of
the
decedent,
we're
not
concerned
with
that.
then
it
contained
this
language
applying
to
the
proceeds
of
--
payable
to
other
beneficiaries.
it
provided
simply
that
in
such
a
case,
they
should
be
taxed
to
the
extent
that
the
policies
were
taken
out
by
the
decedent
upon
his
own
right.
now,
that
language
remained
unchanged
through
subsequent
revenue
acts
until
the
1942
act.
but
between
1918
and
1942,
it
was
a
matter
of
much
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
phrase,
“taken
out
by
the
decedent
upon
his
own
right.”
there
were
at
least
four
interpretations
which
were
suggested
and
at
one
time
or
another,
adopted
by
the
treasury
or
by
the
lower
courts.
one
interpretation
was
that
that
meant
that
there
should
be
included
in
the
gross
estate,
proceeds
of
policies
only
--
only
when
the
decedent
had
retained
incidence
of
ownership
until
death.
a
second
interpretation
was
that
the
proceeds
were
included
only
when
and
--
only
and
to
the
extent
that
the
decedent
had
paid
the
premium,
so-called
premium
payment
tax.
a
third
interpretation
was
that
the
proceeds
were
included
only
if
both
factors
were
present,
namely
that
the
decedent
paid
premiums
and
retained
incidents
of
ownership.
a
fourth
interpretation
was
the
--
an
alternative
tax,
proceeds
included,
if
the
decedent
either
retained
incidents
of
ownership
or
had
paid
premiums.
the
1942
act,
congress
adopted
the
alternative
tax,
then
under
the
1954
act,
congress
adopted
solely
the
incidents
of
ownership
tax
and
that
is
the
present
act.
and
that,
roughly
speaking,
is
the
situation
as
far
as
the
statutory
history
is
concerned.
now,
turning
first
of
all
to
the
direct
tax
argument,
the
contention
of
the
government
is
simply
is,
this
is
not
a
direct
tax,
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
is
a
tax
upon
a
testamentary
transfer.
there
is
a
sufficient
testamentary
transfer
here,
at
death
to
warrant,
constitutionally,
the
imposition
of
a
federal
death
tax.
or
second,
in
the
alternative,
if
this
court
should
feel
that
there
is
not
a
sufficient
testamentary
transfer,
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
tax
is
one
upon
the
inter
vivos
transfer,
which
are
here
involved,
with
payment
of
the
tax
simply
being
postponed
until
the
date
of
death.
mr.
kramer
not
necessarily.
under
the
federal
estate
tax,
as
i
shall
point
out
in
a
moment,
there
are
numerous
inter
vivos
transfers
which
are
covered
by
the
federal
estate
tax.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
those,
where
a
life
estate
as
reserved
by
the
transferor.
those
where
the
transferor
has
powers
of
revocation
or
amendment,
in
general,
those
were
the
transferor
as
--
is
sometimes
said,
keeps
a
strength
on
the
transfer,
those
where
he
has
certain
rights
of
reversion.
also,
those
involving
jointly
owned
property
under
certain
circumstances.
turning
--
and
by
the
way,
i
might
also
point
out,
of
course,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
--
solely
with
a
problem
of
constitutionality.
there
is,
of
course,
the
usual
presumption
in
favor
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
more
than
that,
because
of
that
presumption
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
if
there
are
several
possible
interpretation
of
the
statute,
this
court
generally
will
not
deliberately
adopt
an
interpretation
which
will
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional,
instead
this
court
will
ordinarily
adopt
such
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
if
it
all
possible,
which
will
result
at
voting
it
constitutional.
well,
is
it
--
position
of
the
government
that
this
statute
maybe
properly
interpreted
as
a
tax
either
upon
the
transfer
here
at
death,
or
a
tax
upon
the
inter
vivos
transfer
or
if
you
will
really,
a
tax
upon
the
combination
of
the
two
transfers
involved.
mr.
kramer
yes.
mr.
kramer
well,
i
don't
know
of
any.
if
i
would
perhaps
take
the
word,
“privilege”,
but
the
general
scheme
of
the
federal
estate
tax
and
this
court
has
pointed
that
out,
is
that
it
is
a
tax
upon
transfers
at
death.
but
as
you
and
i
had
just
discussed,
there
are
many
inter
vivos
transfers
which
are
included
within
that.
furthermore,
i
suppose,
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
its
opinion,
is
that
the
name
you
give
the
tax
really
doesn't
matter.
in
a
sense
i
suppose,
congress
could
simply
enact
a
“transfer
tax”
without
saying
whether
the
transfer
had
to
be
a
death
or
inter
vivos.
the
only
constitutional
issue,
i
suppose,
arises
here.
if
you
had
a
death
tax,
which
tax
is
certain
inter
vivos
transfers,
there
must
be
some
rational
basis
for
taxing
some
inter
vivos
transfers,
but
not
all
inter
vivos
transfers
under
the
death
tax.
if
congress,
for
example,
rather
say,
should
enact
the
statute
and
saying,
“only
inter
vivos
transfers
made
by
redheaded
men,
shall
be
taxed
under
the
federal
estate
tax.
or
only
inter
vivos
transfers
made
by
republicans
or
by
democrats,
that
might
well
be.
in
fact,
i
think
it
would
be,
so
i
refer
indiscriminatory
as
to
the
--
a
violation
of
due
process,
though
not
necessarily
a
direct
tax.
but
turning
the
moment
to
the
direct
tax
argument,
it
is
the
vision
of
the
government
that
practically
speaking,
there
is
a
testamentary
transfer
here,
in
two
aspects.
first
of
all,
the
death
of
the
insured
here
marks
the
point
of
time
when
the
beneficiary
gets
actual
enjoyment,
actual
control,
actual
possession
of
the
moneys
in
question.
it's
the
point
of
time,
so
to
speak,
when
the
property,
if
you
will,
shifts
from
the
insurance
company
to
the
beneficiary,
from
a
to
b.
but
more
than
that,
it
not
simply
marks
the
point
of
time
when
that
shift
comes
and
this
is
far
more
important.
it
marks
the
moment
when
ordinarily,
the
barrier
of
the
policy
as
far
as
the
beneficiary
is
concerned
increases
tremendously.
take
this
case
for
example,
the
moment
before
death,
what
was
the
value
of
policy
ownership
to
the
wife?
well,
at
most,
it
was
the
approximate
price
surrender
value.
rough
--
a
rough
calculation
shows
that
that
would
amount
to
about
$60,000.
the
moment
after
death
or
the
moment
of
death,
the
value
of
the
policy
was
the
face
amount,
namely
$125,000.
it
doubled
in
value.
mr.
kramer
putting
it,
i
suppose,
somewhat
monthly.
one
might
call
this
death
insurance,
rather
than
life
insurance.
or
to
put
it
in
other
way,
the
policy
is
worth
far,
far
more
in
the
usual
case
and
in
this
case,
when
the
insured
is
dead
and
when
he's
alive.
that
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
that
type
of
increase
in
death,
that
realization,
so
to
speak,
in
actual
case
of
the
beneficiary's
right
is
a
sufficient
testamentary
event
to
warrant
the
imposition
here
of
an
estate
tax.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
now,
in
that
connection
though,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
this
court,
in
quite
analogous
situation,
has
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
a
tax.
take
the
case
of
tyler
against
the
united
states,
cited
on
pages
10
and
14
of
our
brief.
that
case
sustained
the
constitutionally
of
a
tax
which
said,
“that
when
one
of
two
tenants
by
the
entirety
dies,
there
shall
be
included
in
the
estate
of
the
decedent
tenant,
if
he
was
the
original
source
for
the
property,
the
entire
property
of
the
tenant.”
now,
a
very
strong
argument
was
made
in
that
case,
in
the
tyler
case,
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
do
that
on
the
very
same
ground
as
here.
first,
that
it
was
a
direct
tax,
because
there
was
no
testamentary
transfer.
second,
that
it
violate
the
due
process.
and
this
court,
of
course,
pointed
out,
well,
in
the
first
place,
as
to
approximately
one-half
of
the
property,
you
might
well
say
that
one-half
was
owned
by
the
tenant
who
died,
but
then
the
argument
was
made.
well,
if
that's
true,
what
about
the
other
half
of
the
policy?
you
see
that
perhaps
is
roughly
similar
to
the
cash
surrender
value
here
of
the
policies
you
were
talking
about.
mr.
kramer
yes.
mr.
kramer
no,
sir.
definitely
not.
mr.
kramer
that
would
bring
me
the
second
phase
of
my
argument.
i
think
that
you'll
put
your
finger
there
on
a
logical
felon,
in
the
argument
in
the
opinion
of
the
courts
below
and
in
the
argument
of
the
taxpayer.
it
does
not
follow,
conceding
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
there
is
no
testament
--
the
--
if
there
is
no
testamentary
transfer
here
that
there
--
then
is
a
direct
tax.
the
only
conclusion
you
can
logically
draw
from
the
fact
there
is
no
testamentary
transfer,
is
there
is
no
tax
on
a
testamentary
transfer.
but
there
still
maybe
and
indeed
it
is
the
contention
of
the
government
that
there
is
a
tax
on
the
inter
vivos
transfers
involved
here.
because
there
are,
of
course,
inter
vivos
transfers,
that
the
inter
vivos
transfer
of
the
assignment
of
the
policy
and
there
is
the
inter
vivos
transfer
that
occurs
each
time
that
the
decedent
paid
premiums
between
1936
when
he
assigned
the
policy
until
he
died
in
1954.
mr.
kramer
that
is
perfectly
correct.
mr.
kramer
yes.
mr.
kramer
well,
it
would
be
immaterial
because
i
--
i
--
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
statute
itself,
was
not
taxed.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
or
another
way
one
might
put
it
is
that,
you
have
here
a
tax
on
the
inter
vivos
transfer
with
payments
simply
being
postponed
until
death.
and
there's
a
good
sensible
reason
for
postponing
the
payment
until
death.
it
isn't
until
death
that
the
beneficiary
actually
gets
the
full
benefits,
the
face
value
of
the
policy
and
it
isn't
until
death
he
--
that
you
can
really
determine,
with
fairness,
the
value
what
the
beneficiary
gets.
mr.
kramer
but
the
important
thing
as
you
say
is
the
payment
of
premiums,
if
this
were
a
direct
tax,
congress
then
might
simply
have
said
the
proceed
shall
be
included
in
the
gross
estate,
even
if
he
didn't
pay
any
premiums
and
even
if
he
didn't
have
any
incidents
of
ownership,
but
that
isn't
what
congress
said.
congress
said
the
proceeds
shall
be
included
only
in
the
--
only
proportionately
to
the
amount
of
premiums
he
paid.
in
other
words,
the
tax
is
limited
to
the
insurance
that
the
decedent
bought,
that
he
purchased.
mr.
kramer
well,
that
is
the
effect
under
the
statute
because
congress
has
put
in
section
404
a
special
provision
to
avoid
any
retroactivity
here.
and
under
that
provision,
the
internal
revenue
service
here,
refunded
a
little
or
less
than
half
of
the
tax
on
the
policy
proceeds,
a
little
less
than
half.
now,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court,
so
far
as
i
know,
has
never
in
any
estate
tax
case
despite
the
fact
the
point
has
been
raised
many
times,
ever
held
that
there
was
a
direct
tax.
this
court
has
always
managed
to
find
in
any
estate
tax
case
where
the
point
was
raised,
that
there
was
either
a
testamentary
transfer
or
an
inter
vivos
transfers
or
a
combination,
which
might
be
the
subject
of
the
tax.
mr.
kramer
thank
you.
mr.
kramer
frankly,
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
think
we
have.
mr.
kramer
mr.
justice,
i
would
respectfully
decline.
mr.
kramer
yes.
well
--
mr.
kramer
yes,
there
is.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
the
second
circuit
affirmed
per
curiae,
it's
set
out
here
on
page
24
of
our
brief
in
the
footnote
dividing
the
page.
the
second
circuit
affirmed
per
curiae
in
adopting
as
its
own,
the
opinion
of
the
tax
court
in
the
loeb
case,
which
sustained
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax
here.
and
there
are
--
are
two
district
courts
which
have
reached
the
same
conclusion.
one,
in
the
colonial
trust
case,
which
actually
involved
--
not
the
1942
act,
but
the
prior
acts
and
the
schwartz's
case
down
in
louisiana,
the
district
court
case
which
also
affirmed
the
constitutionality
of
death.
mr.
kramer
i
believe
not.
mr.
kramer
they
certainly
did
in
these
cases.
mr.
kramer
they
met
the
issue.
in
fact,
they
more
than
passed
on
it.
at
the
time
they
rendered
their
decision,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
released
a
contrary
conclusion.
they
examined
the
reasoning
of
the
court
and
they
respectfully
declined
the
power.
and
they
--
incidentally,
they
reiterated
their
holding
on
--
in
the
loeb
case
and
in
a
later
decision,
the
baker
case,
which
is
also
cited
in
the
footnote
on
page
24
of
our
brief.
mr.
kramer
that's
right.
they
affirmed
per
curiam
saying
that
the
opinion
of
the
tax
court,
they
would
adopt
instead.
mr.
kramer
yes.
there
has
been.
mr.
kramer
i
think
that
was
a
--
a
state
one.
mr.
kramer
yes.
there
--
as
far
as
i
know
now,
there
are
several
gift
tax
cases
onto
myers,
where
the
problem
of
retroactivity
was
involved,
which
is
not
involved
here.
and
then
there
are
--
there
are
two
and
to
my
knowledge
only
two
federal
estate
tax
cases
that
have
upheld
an
argument
based
on
constitutionality.
one
is
heiner
against
donnan
in
1932.
the
other
is
a
rather
unusual
case,
nichols
against
coolidge.
mr.
kramer
they
certainly
have.
and
the
taxpayer
in
fact
and
the
courts
below,
neither
--
neither
the
kohl
case,
nor
the
court
below
here,
nor
the
taxpayer
in
his
brief,
has
even
cited
either
those
two
cases.
mr.
kramer
yes,
it
had.
in
fact,
it
was
narrowly
limited
in
one
of
the
cases
not
cited
in
our
brief
binney
against
long,
very
narrowly
limited.
mr.
kramer
it
may
have
been.
mr.
kramer
yes,
it
was.
as
to
the
--
a
vested
and
contingent
remain.
he
made
that
distinction.
mr.
kramer
i
simply
cannot
answer
that.
under
the
--
the
1918
act,
i
think
one
reason
for
it
may
have
been
that
everyone,
the
scholars,
commentators,
the
treasury
itself
and
the
court,
the
lower
courts,
were
very
confused
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
language
i
referred
to
under
the
1918
act.
then
congress
passed
the
1942
act
specifically
saying
what
it
was
and
i
think
the
treasury,
no
doubt
then
gave
up
the
battle
under
the
prayer.
this
is
the
first
case
under
the
1942
act
to
reach
this
court.
mr.
kramer
well,
the
disclosure
in
the
reports,
as
i
understand
that,
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
split
somewhat
along
party
lines
and
the
republican
majority
took
the
position
that
life
insurance
was
being
singled
out
for
unusual
treatment
under
the
premium
payment
tax.
the
majority
took
--
the
minority
took
the
position
is
that
it
was
property
single
life
insurance
out
for
unusual
treatment,
because
it
was
a
unique
kind
of
property.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
but
as
far
as
i
know,
there
was
no
suggestion
that
congress
was
repealing
it,
because
of
constitutional
policy.
it
was
done
as
a
matter
of
physical
policy,
so
it
is
the
matter
of
fiscal
policy.
mr.
kramer
under
the
1954
act
--
mr.
kramer
--
the
proceeds
of
the
policy
here
in
the
1954
act,
would
not
be
taxable
because
the
1954
act
repeal
the
so-called
premium
payment
test
that
is
in
the
1942
act,
which
is
in
question
here.
mr.
kramer
well,
we
pointed
out
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
that
there
are
cases
pending
in
two
other
circuits
involving
this,
the
fourth
and
the
eighth
circuit
which
involves
substantial
sums
of
money.
mr.
kramer
i
expect
they're
undoubtedly,
would
be.
mr.
kramer
for
legislation
to
allow
it,
that
would
be
the
customary
practice
that
they
were
outlawed
by
time.
yes.
well,
i
want
to
address
myself,
just
for
a
moment,
to
the
due
process
argument.
conceding
that
this
is
an
indirect
tax
--
mr.
kramer
--
the
taxpayer
argues
here
that
even
if
the
tax
is
indirect,
it
is
so
discriminatory
and
unfair
as
to
be
a
violation
of
due
process
and
of
the
fifth
amendment.
well,
as
i
say,
the
nature
of
that
argument
simply
is
that
what
you
are
in
effect
doing
here
is
you
are
taxing
some
inter
vivos
transfers,
but
not
all
inter
vivos
transfers
under
a
death
tax.
and
that
discrimination
--
that
drawing
the
line
has
been
drawn
so
unfairly,
so
outrageously
as
to
violate
due
process.
well,
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
general
have
said
that
you
may
tax
inter
vivos
transfer
under
the
federal
estate
tax,
provided
there
is
a
good
reason
for
doing
so.
so
it
isn't
completely
arbitrary.
that,
for
instance,
was
the
basis
in
which
this
court
in
the
milliken
case
sustained
the
tax
on
transfers
made
in
contemplation
of
death.
those
transfers
obviously
are
inter
vivos
transfers,
outright.
but
the
court
sustained
it
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
reasonable
thing
to
do.
why
was
it
reasonable?
well,
it
was
reasonable
because
there
was
a
testamentary
state
of
mind
in
the
transferor.
and
if
you
didn't
tax
this
thing,
you
would
have
widespread
avoidance
and
evasion
of
the
estate
tax.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
has
built
around
the
tax
on
transfers
at
death
sort
of
a
--
a
protective
treasurer
of
taxes,
death
taxes
on
inter
vivos
transfers
in
order
to
avoid
a
widespread
evasion
of
the
--
of
federal
estate
tax.
now
--
mr.
kramer
well,
they
didn't
entirely
go
back
though.
they
kept
the
tax
on
transfers
in
contemplation
of
death.
they
kept
the
tax
on
revocable
transfers,
transfers
of
the
reserved
life
estate
and
transfers
of
a
certain
reversionary
right.
mr.
kramer
well,
the
--
a
gift
made
in
contemplation
of
death
is
complete,
legally.
mr.
kramer
well,
evasion
of
course
that
they
all
--
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it
whether
it
is
evasion
or
avoidance
perhaps.
tax
lawyers
sometimes
resent
the
word
evasion,
i
believe.
but
the
point
i
should
like
to
make
here
is
that
the
nature
of
life
insurance
is
such
that
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
and
we're
considering
this
just
from
a
constitutional
standpoint,
not
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
we,
as
legislators,
would
think
otherwise,
but
from
a
constitutional
standpoint.
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
for
congress
in
1942
to
enact
the
premium
payment
tax
because
the
nature
of
life
insurance
is
such
that
you
don't
have
the
usual
factors
operating
which
determined
from
making
inter
vivos
transfers
of
other
kinds
of
property.
now,
that's
true
for
these
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
when
you
go
to
make
an
inter
vivos
transfer
when
insurance
policies
is
involved
here,
the
gift
tax
you
have
to
pay
ordinarily
is
based
only
upon
a
fracture
of
the
death
value
of
the
policy.
the
--
the
gift
tax
is
based
upon
the
so-called
replacement
value
of
the
policy
at
the
time
of
the
gift
and
that
ordinarily
will
be
far,
far
less
than
the
face
amount
of
the
policy
payable
at
death.
now,
of
course,
it
is
also
true
that
if
you
continue
to
pay
premium,
each
premium
payment
is
a
later
gift
subject
to
the
gift
tax.
but
again,
you
are
entitled
to
an
annual
exclusion
under
the
gift
tax
of
$3000.
you
can
pay
it
with
many
premiums
with
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case,
the
total
annual
premiums
payable
on
all
four
policies
amounting
to
about
$3800,
so
all
the
$800,
the
very
annual
premium
payment
after
the
transfer
at
1936,
would
be
automatically
excluded
from
the
gift
tax.
but
then,
of
course,
there‘s
another
--
there's
another
reason
here.
in
the
case
of
ordinary
property,
houses,
automobiles,
stocks
and
bonds
and
so
on,
there's
a
strong
deterrent
to
transferring
the
property,
because
a
man
when
he's
alive,
wants
to
own
the
property,
in
order
to
use
it
and
to
enjoy
it.
for
now,
ordinarily,
you
don't
use
and
enjoy
life
insurance
the
same
way
you
do
a
car
or
a
house.
one
of
the
main
reasons
you
buy
life
insurance,
on
--
on
your
life
is
to
provide
for
your
dependence
after
your
death.
well,
as
far
as
providing
for
your
dependence
after
your
death,
you
don't
have
to
own
the
policy.
if
the
dependents
owning
the
policy,
one
might
even
argue
that
there's
--
they're
better
provided
for.
if
you
assign
the
policy
to
your
wife
as
was
done
here,
you
can
--
you
could
continue
to
have
the
--
the
enjoyment
of
the
policy,
so
to
speak,
in
the
sense
that
you
know
your
wife
is
provided
for
after
you
die.
that
point
is
very
well
brought
out
in
the
income
tax
case
this
court
decided,
burnet
against
wells,
which
is
cited
on
page
25
of
our
brief.
that
case
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
provision
of
the
federal
income
tax,
which
tax
to
the
grantor,
the
income
of
a
funded
insurance
trust,
even
though
he
has
made
an
irrevocable
transfer
to
the
trust.
had
no
ownership
in
it
in
any
way,
no
control
of
it,
when
the
trust
was
to
fund
insurance
policies
on
his
own
life.
and
this
court,
in
writing
the
opinion,
noted
that
from
a
standpoint
of
the
grantor,
he
still
was
getting
all
the
enjoyment
out
of
this
income
when
it
was
used
to
pay
the
premiums
on
the
insurance
on
his
life,
which
he'd
assigned
to
his
wife,
because
one
of
the
main
element
in
life
insurance
is
the
sense
of
enjoyment
that
men
obtain
from
knowing
that
their
dependents
are
provided
for.
now,
of
course,
it
is
true
that
when
you
make
an
outright
assignment
of
the
policy,
you
do
give
up
certain
rights,
cash
right
to
get
the
cash
surrender
value,
loan
value,
that
type
of
thing.but
even
there
is
a
practical
matter.
most
life
insurance
policies
are
not
assigned
the
total
strength.
they're
usually
assigned
as
here,
to
close
family
relatives
and
it's
not,
i
think,
an
unfair
inference
to
say
that
if
the
decedent
here,
after
you
assign
these
policies
and
before
(inaudible)
had
desperately
needed
to
get
the
case
surrender
value.
he
might
have
persuaded
his
wife
to
make
it
available
to
him.
mr.
kramer
he
might
not,
that's
true.
mr.
kramer
on
--
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
in
the
bullard
case,
which
is
cited
on
page
50
in
our
brief,
followed
a
similar
line
of
reasoning
here,
in
the
bullard
case,
this
court
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
a
vision
of
the
federal
estate
tax,
which
said,
“if
a
grantor
transfers
property
and
trust
and
provides
that
the
property
shall
be
to
a
for
life,
to
b
in
remain,”
but
that
the
grantor
should
have
the
power
to
revoke
the
trust,
but
only
--
but
only
if
one
or
more
of
the
beneficiaries
consented.
well,
now,
this
court
pointed
out
there,
in
answer
to
the
argument
that's
made.
that
as
a
rule,
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
would
be
close
family
relatives
of
the
grantor
and
that
he
probably
would
not
have
much
difficulty
in
getting
their
consent
to
revocation,
if
they
really
need
it.
mr.
kramer
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
kramer
oh
no,
no
indeed.
that
all
you
have
to
agree
is
that
the
policy
is
not
so
outrageous,
not
so
arbitrary
as
to
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
kramer
that
is
correct.
well,
turning
for
just
one
more
moment
to
a
final
point
here,
the
retroactivity
of
the
tax.
of
course,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
constitution
which
flatly
says
a
retroactive
tax
is
unconstitutional.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
upheld
retroactive
taxes,
particularly
retroactive
income
tax.
this
court
has
only
said
that
a
retroactive
tax
is
unconstitutional
if
it
is
really
outrageous
subject.
i
mean,
every
retroactive
tax,
in
the
sense,
has
a
certain
amount
of
unfairness,
so
it
isn't
enough
simply
that
the
tax
is
retroactive
and
therefore,
unfair
to
be
unconstitutional.
it
has
to
be
something
far
more
than
(inaudible).
well
now,
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
position
of
the
government,
that
the
tax
to
the
extent,
if
that
all,
but
it
is
retroactive,
is
well
within
the
constitutional
limits.
in
the
first
place,
congress,
so
to
speak,
deliberately
mitigated
any
unfairness
of
retroactivity,
because
--
because
congress
said
that
where
as
here,
the
ensured
retained
no
incidents
of
ownership
after
january
10th,
1941,
in
the
policy,
then
all
premium
payments
made
before
1941
should
be
excluded
in
determining
the
proportion
of
the
premiums
he
had
paid.
mr.
kramer
this
argument
is
directed
now,
to
the
argument
that
i
understand
is
made,
that
this
tax
is
a
retroactive
one
and
the
argument
direct
that
the
tax
is
retroactive,
i
take
it
as
may
on
this
basis.
the
insured
died,
of
course,
after
the
1942
act.
there
is
no
retroactivity
and
that
sense.
but
the
insurer
had
transferred
the
policy
in
1936,
before
the
1942
act.
my
argument
now
is
that
even
if
he
transferred
the
policy
at
1936,
congress,
in
order
to
avoid
any
possible
unfairness,
has
said
that
all
premiums
he
paid
before
1941
are
to
be
excluded
in
taking
into
account
what
amount
of
the
proceeds
are
to
be
included
in
his
gross
estate.
congress
has
gone
out
of
its
way
to
remove
so
to
say,
any
sting
of
unfairness.
beyond
that
also,
of
course,
when
this
transfer
was
made
in
1936,
the
then
outstanding
treasury
regulations
said
that
there
would
be
a
tax.
there
was
no
surprise,
so
to
speak.
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
man
makes
a
transfer
and
there's
no
statute
taxing
and
then
years
later,
to
his
complete
surprise,
congress
passes
a
statute
and
says,
“because
you
made
a
transfer
years
and
years
ago,
we're
now
going
to
tax
you.”
well,
it
didn't
happen
here.
this
transfer
was
made
long
after
the
1918
act
was
in
effect.
and
between
1918
and
1936,
when
this
transfer
was
made,
the
treasury
had
taken
the
consistent
position
that
the
premium
payment
test
apply.
some
courts
have
said
yes,
some
courts
have
said,
no.
whether
or
not
the
treasury
was
right,
it's
beside
the
point.
the
mere
fact
that
treasury
made
that
claim
gave
notice,
so
to
speak.
he
was
unnoticed.
he
was
not
until
after
the
transfer
was
made,
the
following
year
that
the
treasury
reversed
its
position
and
said
that
the
sole
test
was
the
other.
but
even
so,
congress
avoided
retroactivity.
mr.
kramer
well,
there
--
i
do
not
believe
there
are
any
actual
cases
cited
in
the
brief.
the
only
estate
--
federal
estate
tax
case
i
know,
is
one
that
has
not
been
cited.
it
is
the
case
of
nichols
against
coolidge.
nichols
against
coolidge
274
u.s.
531
and
one
should
read
with
nichols
against
coolidge,
two
other
cases,
coolidge
against
long,
282
u.s.
582
which
involved
a
massachusetts
death
tax
upon
the
same
property
and
then
binney
against
long
299
u.s.
280,
which
severely
restricts
and
qualify
the
whole
doctrine
of
the
coolidge
case.
on
the
other
hand
of
course,
this
case,
this
court
has
upheld
a
retroactive
federal
estate
tax
under
circumstances
that
seemed,
in
a
sense,
much
more
unfair
than
they're
involved
here.
in
the
jacobs
case,
which
is
cited
on
--
in
our
brief
on
pages
21
and
22,
many
years
before
there
was
any
federal
estate
tax,
before
1960,
a
man
who
owned
property
transferred
it
--
it
to
himself
and
his
wife
as
joint
tenants.
then
he
died
after
1960.
this
court
sustained
the
inclusion
in
his
gross
estate
of
the
entire
property
he
transferred
to
himself
and
his
wife
as
joint
tenants.
now,
the
argument
was
made
there,
very
strongly
that
this
was
unfair,
because
when
the
man
set
up
this
joint
tenancy,
he
had
not
the
slightest
warning
that
any
federal
estate
tax
would
be
enacted
years
later.
furthermore,
when
their
federal
estate
tax
was
passed
in
1960,
the
man
was
caught.
he
couldn't
back
out.
at
the
very
most,
he
could've
gotten
back
one-half
of
his
property,
if
he'd
severed
the
joint
tenancy.
but
as
far
as
the
other
half
of
the
property
was
concerned,
he
was
stopped.
he
was
taken
by
surprise
and
he
couldn't
back
out.
but
in
spite
of
that
fact,
this
court
sustained
that
act.
and
a
somewhat
similar
case,
perhaps
even
stronger
is
one
not
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
per
curiam
opinion
of
this
court,
third
national
bank
against
white,
287
u.s.
577.
the
same
facts
as
the
jacob
case,
except
it
was
a
tenancy
by
the
entirety
and
the
difference
is
and
the
thing
that
makes
it
even
stronger
is
in
the
case
of
the
tenancy
by
the
entirety
created
before
the
federal
estate
tax,
there
is
no
way
you
can
back
out
at
all.
you
can't,
before
death,
sever
a
tenancy
by
the
entirety
in
most
states
and
that
was
true
in
the
case
herein
question.
mr.
kramer
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
kramer
the
jacobs
case
is
that
--
it
is
a
joint
tenancy
and
then
the
other
case
is
the
tenancy
by
the
entirety
and
--
mr.
kramer
no.
mr.
kramer
not
fairly,
no.
it
has
been
severely
restricted
but
--
mr.
kramer
i
should
think
it
well
might
be.
i
should
think
it
might
be.
