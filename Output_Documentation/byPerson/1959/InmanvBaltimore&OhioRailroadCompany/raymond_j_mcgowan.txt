mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
members
of
the
supreme
court,
this
is
a
negligence
case
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
the
action
was
tried
in
summit
county
town
police
court.
a
verdict
was
rendered
for
the
plaintiff.
a
general
verdict
was
rendered
for
the
plaintiff
and
in
addition
to
the
general
verdict,
there
were
two
interrogatories
submitted
by
the
railroad
and
the
first
was,
“do
you
find
the
defendant
was
negligent?”
the
answer
by
the
jury
to
that
special
interrogatory
was,
“yes,
in
part.”
and
the
second
interrogatory
was,
“in
what
--
if
your
answer
to
interrogatory
number
one
is
in
the
affirmative,
then
in
what
respect
do
you
find
the
railroad
was
negligent?”
and
the
answer
was,
“in
failing
to
provide
enough
protection.”
the
court
rendered
a
judgment
on
the
verdict,
the
town
police
court
did
and
the
railroad
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
rendered
a
final
judgment,
took
the
judgment
away
from
the
petitioner,
rendered
the
final
judgment
in
favor
of
the
railroad.
this
accident
occurred
at
a
railroad
crossing.
the
plaintiff
was
a
crossing
watch
and
he
was
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
when
he
was
struck
by
an
automobile
at
the
crossing
while
the
train
was
passing
over
the
crossing.
it
--
it
was
the
most
unusual
crossing
in
that
tallmadge
avenue
is
a
main
highway
on
akron,
extending
in
an
easterly
and
westerly
direction
and
home
avenue
is
--
is
a
highway
extending
in
a
north-easterly
and
south-westerly
direction.
they
intersect
one
another
and
the
railroad
tracks
of
the
defendant
or
the
respondent,
three
of
them,
intersect
both
highways
right
in
the
middle
of
the
intersection.
so
that
we
--
we
have
a
situation
there
where
home
avenue
intersects
tallmadge
avenue,
west
of
the
tracks
and
it
also
intersects
tallmadge
avenue,
east
of
the
tracks.
there
are
actually
two
intersections
there,
thus
providing
a
cutoff
for
automobiles
that
are
proceeding
in
a
northerly
direction
on
home
avenue
into
--
into
tallmadge
avenue.
on
this
particular
night,
there
was
a
train,
a
train
that
was
travelling
in
an
easterly
direction
north
geographically
and
it
was
the
watchman's
duty
to
take
his
position
on
the
westerly
side
of
the
railroad
track
and
face
the
train
for
the
purpose
of
watching
for
another
train
which
was
due
out
of
ravenna,
ohio
and
which
had
left
ravenna,
ohio
by
15
minutes
before
that
time,
and
in
order
to
not
clear
the
crossing
before
this
other
train
arrived
in
the
event
it
did
arrive
before
the
train
which
is
on
the
crossing
passed.
while
he
was
standing
there
facing
the
train,
the
train
that
was
passing
was
--
the
caboose
was
going
over
the
crossing
and
he
took
a
step
backward
and
went
to
turn,
when
he
was
struck
by
an
automobile,
which
was
being
driven
in
a
northerly
direction
on
home
avenue
and
the
--
the
driver
was
making
a
left
hand
turn
on
this
cutoff
which
is
located
west
of
the
railroad
tracks,
struck
the
watchman,
a
67-year
old
man
and
seriously
injured
him.
and
he
--
we
sued
the
railroad
--
the
railroad
was
sued.
the
driver
sped
on.
he
was
a
hips
--
hit-skip
driver.
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
yes.
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
your
honor,
if
you'll
turn
to
page,
in
our
record,
page
234
joint
exhibit
a.
now,
the
watchman,
you'll
see
is
tallmadge
avenue
there
and
right
where
the
letter
g
is
on
the
tallmadge
is
where
the
watchman
was
facing
to
the
--
to
the
east.
and
home
avenue,
this
automobile,
down
at
the
bottom,
you'll
see
home
avenue
there,
he
was
making
a
left
hand
turn
into
tallmadge
avenue
when
he
struck
the
watchman.
now,
if
you'll
notice
home
avenue
intersects,
there's
an
intersection
west
of
the
tracks
and
there's
an
intersection
east
of
the
track.
now,
what
actually
happened
that
night,
this
train
was
going
in
a
northerly
direction.
it
was
a
freight
train,
about
80
cars
and
it
had
an
engine.
and
there
were
--
it
was
--
it
was
--
one
witness
testified,
one
of
the
defendant's
witness
testified
that
he
pulled
up
on
home
avenue
back
of
this
car
which
had
made
that
left
turn,
that
that
train
took
about
8
or
10
minutes
between
5
and
10
minutes
to
cross.
and
home
avenue
at
that
point,
is
on
a
downgrade.
the
railroad
tracks
were
on
an
upgrade
as
they
go
north.
now,
what
actually
happened
after
that
train,
after
the
caboose
passed
home
avenue,
the
--
this
driver
would
--
he
was
a
second
or
third
one
in
line,
waiting
there
for
the
train,
decided
to
get
out
of
the
line
and
he
--
he
made
that
left
hand
turn
in
the
east
tallmadge
avenue
--
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
he
did
not
cross
the
track,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
that
15-foot
roadway,
right.
and
he
strikes
the
watchman
--
the
--
on
the
blindside
and
he
proceeds
on.
now,
there
was
--
there
was
another
--
there
were
a
series
of
cars
of
course
that
were
going
east
on
tallmadge
avenue
waiting
there,
they
had
not
started
to
move
up.
they
were
all
back.
they
were
west
of
that
15-foot
strip
at
the
time
this
accident
occurred.
now,
then
the
court
of
appeals
says
--
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
no,
your
honor.
it
happened
right
in
the
center
of
tallmadge
avenue.
yes,
the
plaintiff
testified
in
all
the
test
--
most
all
the
testimony
is
that
he
was
about
two
or
three
feet
west
of
the
--
of
the
most
westerly
track
which
would
be
right
where
the
letter
g
is
located
on
the
word,
“tallmadge.”
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
in
the
center
of
tallmadge
and
he
was
facing
east
and
this
happened
at
night,
it
was
about
10
minutes
after
12
and
it
was
a
--
a
winter
night,
cold
and
there
was
one
street
light,
there
was
one
street
light.
now,
this
joint
exhibit
here
shows
the
street
lights,
there
was
one
street
light
located
about
25
or
30
feet
west
of
the
tracks,
west
of
the
intersection
of
home
avenue
on
the
--
on
the
south
side.
there's
a
light
pole
there
and
the
testimony
is
that
it
was
about
25
or
30
feet
from
the
tracks
and
there
is
a
stop
sign
if
--
there
is
a
stop
sign
as
you
--
on
home
avenue
just
before
you
reach
the
tracks
and
there
is
another
stop
sign
on
home
avenue
before
you
get
to
tallmadge
avenue
on
the
northerly
side
of
the
tracks.
now,
there
are
no
stop
signs
located
on
home
avenue
just
where
it
intersects
east
tallmadge
avenue.
there
are
no
other
signs
there
of
any
kind
or
character,
warning
that
--
that
the
--
there
was
a
man
on
duty
and
in
addition
to
that,
of
course,
this
home
avenue
was
not
blocked
in
any
manner
at
all,
it
was
open
and
clear
for
anyone
to
make
that
last
or
that
left
turn,
if
they
desire
to
do
it.
and
one
of
the
witnesses
that
testified
in
the
case
said
it
was
not
a
matter
--
an
uncommon
matter
for
people
that
had
been
waiting
there
on
home
avenue
in
the
line
of
traffic
for
a
train
to
pass
to
--
where
he
described
it
was
jump
the
gun
and
--
and
make
a
left
hand
turn
into
east
tallmadge
avenue.
that
has
been
done,
he
had
seen
it
done
a
number
of
times
before.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
a
final
judgment
in
--
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
it's
on
page
71
of
the
record
and
on
page
68
of
the
record,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
and
you'll
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
i'll
tell
--
now,
then
this
is
a
witness
by
the
name
of
--
of
sam
bailey.
he
was
the
first
car
that
was
parked
on
tallmadge
avenue
just
west
of
the
tracks.
“now,
then,
would
you
just
tell
us
what
you
say
happen
there
that
night
while
you
were
there?”
answer,
“i
had
stopped
for
the
train
and
the
train
was
just
about
to
clear
the
crossing.
i
believe
the
cab
was
coming
over
the
crossing
at
the
time.
this
car,
like
a
lot
of
them
i
seen
there,
jumping
the
gun,
seeing
the
tail
end
of
the
train
coming
up,
went
around
the
cars,
this
car
came
around
several
cars,
there
--
that
was
on
home
avenue
and
turned
west
on
tallmadge
avenue
and
hit
the
watchman.”
“did
you
see
what
position
the
watchman
was
in,
which
way
he
was
facing?”
“i
can't
say
on
that.”
“was
he
standing
still
or
walking?”
“he
was
standing
still
when
he
was
hit.”
does
that
answer
your
--
i
think
that's
the
--
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
--
in
reversing
and
taking
the
judgment
away,
held
that
because
this
man
violated
traffic
ordinances
or
traffic
statutes
that
the
defendant
railroad
was
exculpated
from
any
liability.
they
said
the
--
the
approximate
cars
of
this
accident
and
the
injuries
to
this
watchman
was
the
negligence
of
a
man
by
the
name
of
ball
who
was
driving
this
car
and
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
violated
several
traffic
laws,
that
--
that
exculpated
the
railroad
company.
now,
your
honors,
in
--
in
the
case
--
have
passed
on
this
matter
before
and
the
case
of
cahill,
cahill
versus
new
haven
&
hartford
railroad,
at
--
in
that
case,
which
went
up
from
one
of
the
new
york
courts
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
the
--
the
negligence
of
the
automobile
driver,
the
violation
of
the
ordinance
exculpated
the
driver
in
a
2-to-1
opinion,
this
court
reversed
and
remanded
and
gave
the
verdict
back
in
that
case
as
i
remember,
gave
the
judgment
back.
the
--
the
--
there
were
--
there
was
a
minority
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
minority
opinion,
the
court
stated
that
he
--
he
didn't
think
that
as
a
--
the
court
could
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
had
this
man,
this
watchman
then
permitted,
our
claim
here
is
that
if
this
watchman
had
been
permitted
to
face
the
traffic,
face
home
avenue
and
face
tallmadge
avenue,
he
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
step
aside
or
take
a
step
backwards
and
avoided
being
injured
under
these
circumstances.
now,
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
he
had
to
face
the
train
to
watch
for
this
other
train
which
was
coming
due
there
from
the
opposite
direction.
although
he
did
not
testify
to
the
fact,
the
conductor,
a
witness
for
the
railroad,
conductor
on
the
train
was
--
which
was
passing
over
the
crossing,
testified
that
he
also
had
the
duty
to
watch
for
hot
boxes,
as
that
train
was
proceeding
on
the
crossing.
now,
it's
our
claim
that
under
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
there
was
positive
testimony
here
of
the
fact
that
this
--
that
the
petitioner
had
to
face
the
train
and
was
facing
the
train
at
the
time
this
occurred,
there
was
--
the
testimony
here,
the
pictures
and
the
map
shows
the
--
the
extra
hazardous
condition
of
this
particular
crossing
and
specially
in
the
night
time.
we
say
that
under
all
of
those
facts,
this
was
a
question
for
the
jury
as
--
and
those
were
all
probative
facts
for
the
jury
and
certainly
there
were
enough
facts
here
to
justify
the
inference
that
the
railroad
company
failed
to
exercise
ordinary
care
to
furnish
this
man,
this
plaintiff
or
petitioner
with
a
safe
place
to
work.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
argument
to
mr.
kelly.
mr.
raymond
j.
mcgowan
if
the
court
please,
here.
mr.
kelly
raised
a
question
about
the
signal
system.
now,
there
isn't
any
question,
but
what
he
was
supposed
to
watch
were
the
other
train
that
was
coming.
they
claim
that
there
were
signals
there
and
that
he
could've
looked
at
the
signals,
but
in
any
event,
he
would've
had
to
have
his
back
to
traffic
on
tallmadge
avenue
and
traffic
on
home
avenue,
had
he
watched
the
signal.
but
he
states
why
he
--
he
couldn't
see
the
signal
on
this
particular
night
because
this
was
a
long
freight
train
and
he
--
and
he
says
on
page
17
of
the
record,
“what
was
your
reason
for
looking
towards
(inaudible),
the
answer,
“one,
to
see
if
there
was
a
reflection
of
the
headlight
coming
around
the
curve.
i
couldn't
see
the
light
down
at
east
avenue.”
question,
“why
couldn't
you?”
answer,
“the
eastbound
train
was
blocking
it,
so
that
he
had
look
to
the
left
and
when
he
looked
to
the
left
and
in
the
north,
his
back
had
to
be
to
home
avenue.”
now,
then
he
says
--
mr.
--
mr.
kelly
says
what
can
they
do,
what
could
they
do
to
protect
this
man?
well
in
the
first
place
this
was
an
extra
hazard
at
crossing.
if
they
permitted
this
man
to
face
traffic
after
--
after
that
train
started
across
the
crossing,
if
they
wouldn't
have
shouldered
on
him,
the
additional
duties
of
--
of
watching
for
this
train
which
was
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
and
the
additional
duties
of
watching
for
hot
boxes
and
their
conductor,
mr.
peterson,
stated
that
he
--
that
was
one
of
his
duties.
now
then,
if
they
would've
permitted
him
to
face
traffic,
face
traffic
on
home
avenue
and
tallmadge
avenue,
it's
our
contention
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
step
aside
or
do
anything
to
avoid
being
struck.
now,
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
asked
about
this
drunken
driving.
there
was
one
witness
that
the
railroad
brought
in,
a
man
that
--
that
was
driving
behind
this
person
that
testified
about
three
or
four
blocks
away
and
it's
in
the
record.
he
had
--
had
gotten
up
and
had
an
argument
with
this
man
and
that
he
smelled
liquor
on
his
breath
and
that
in
his
opinion,
he
was
intoxicated.
that's
the
only
evidence.
mr.
inman
was
taken
to
the
hospital.
we
have
no
way,
we
didn't
know
who
this
witness
was,
but
that
was
--
that
was
the
only
evidence
of
any
intoxication.
now,
then,
in
addition
to
that,
if
the
court
please,
we
have
evidence
here.
there's
evidence
in
this
case
that
--
there's
ample
evidence
in
this
case
that
if
this
man,
if
this
man's
--
what
actually
happened
there
is
this.
the
negligence
of
this
fellow
ball
was
enlarged.
we
claim
his
negligence
was
enlarged
by
the
fact
that
---
that
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
had
to
have
his
back
to
traffic
at
this
particular
intersection.
now,
mr.
kelly
made
a
statement
that
there
wasn't
any
evidence
that
traffic
ever
made
a
left
hand
turn
from
home
avenue
into
--
into
tallmadge
avenue.
now,
we'd
like
to
refer
this
court
to
the
exhibits
in
this
case
which
are
found
here.
the
--
the
contour,
the
street
and
the
tracks
on
the
street
show
that
traffic
was
heavy.

and
even
the
defendants,
one
of
the
defendant's
exhibits,
shows
that
traffic
was
heavy
and
that
exhibit
number
is
defendant's
exhibit
e,
which
is
found
at
page
227.
that
shows
that
traffic
was
heavy
on
the
intersection
west
of
the
railroad
tracks
from
home
avenue
into
tallmadge
avenue.
now,
we
claim
that
under
all
of
this
evidence,
there
was
a
factual
situation
there
for
the
jury.
the
jury
resolved
the
facts
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
under
the
decision
of
judge
brennan
in
the
rogers
case,
all
of
these
facts,
the
condition
of
this
crossing
the
nature
of
it,
the
fact
that
there
were
--
that
this
intersection
come
in
from
home
avenue
into
tallmadge
avenue
and
was
not
blocked-off
thereby
permitting
traffic
to
move
and
make
a
left
hand
turn
while
that
man
was
on
duty.
all
of
those
were
factual
situations
along
with
the
fact
that
he
had
his
back
to
traffic
which
the
jury
had
a
right
to
consider
and
they
resolved
those
questions
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
court
of
appeals
presumed
to
take
it
upon
themselves
to
overrule
the
jury
and
incidentally,
they
--
they
--
the
rogers
case
had
been
decided
before
the
case
was
heard
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
instead
of
referring
to
the
rogers
case,
they
cited
the
ohio
jurisprudence
on
negligence.
