mr.
william
a.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
honorable
court.
at
the
very
upset
we
wish
to
say
that
i
think
this
case
must
be
determined
on
the
law
as
laid
down
by
the
rogers
case,
with
which
you
are
all
familiar.
now,
the
test
which
was
prescribed
in
that
case
which
at
the
outset,
i
wish
to
quote
if
i
may
is
simply
this
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
speaking
of
the
fela
statute.
you
there
said
and
i
quote,
“under
this
statute,
the
test
of
a
jury
case
is
simply
where
that
approves
justifiable
reason,
the
inclusion
that
the
employ
of
negligence
played
any
part
even
the
slightest,
in
producing
the
injury
or
death
for
which
damages
are
sought.”
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
rogers
case
had
not
been
decided.
however,
upon
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
upon
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
the
rogers
case
was
unsuccessfully
erred
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
it
was
and
is
our
position
and
it's
a
very
simple
one
that
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
show
or
do
not
make
a
jury
question
under
the
test
laid
down
in
the
rogers
case.
mr.
william
a.
kelly
it
does
not,
your
honor.
but
it
was
--
rogers
case
was
urged
in
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
why
do
we
say
that
and
what
is
the
basis
for
that
statement?
this
is
a
long
record,
but
from
this
record,
we
have
attempted
to
call
for
this
court
certain
facts
concerning
which
here
can
be
no-dispute.
and
those
facts
are
related
in
perhaps,
greater
brevity
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
constitute
or
set
out
the
basis
for
the
opinion
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
let
us
look
at
the
record.
this
crossing
was
adequately
equipped
with
a
two-way
signal
system
which
indicated
to
the
watchman,
both
inside
and
outside
the
watchman's
shanty
of
the
approach
of
any
train
from
either
direction.
this
signal
system
went
into
operation
when
a
train,
a
northbound
train
or
an
east
bound
train
was
pointed
too
hard
in
15
feet
east
or
west
of
the
crossing.
the
signal
system
went
into
play
when
a
westbound
train
was
approximately
2000
feet
in
the
crossing.
this
system
had
been
in
existence
for
many
months
and
was
well
known
to
the
petitioner.
the
east
and
westbound
tracks
in
this
area
were
equipped
with
an
automatic
signal
system,
so
that
the
block
signal
where
east
of
the
crossing,
could
be
lighted
when
an
eastbound
train
was
2250
feet
--
15
feet
west
of
the
crossing
and
the
block
signal
west
of
the
crossing
could
be
--
would
be
lighted
when
a
westbound
train
was
3450
feet
east
of
the
crossing.
now
the
petitioner
had
full
knowledge
of
the
operation
of
that
block
six
system
--
signal
system
in
that
particular
area.
the
crossing
was
equipped
with
a
four-way,
highway
automatic
electric
flashers
which
would
activate
when
an
eastbound
train
was
2000
feet
from
the
crossing
and
which
would
seize
to
activate
when
that
train
was
suddenly
5
feet
east
to
the
crossing.
now
on
each
street,
there
were
statutory
highway
railroad
crossing
signs
as
prescribed
by
the
law
of
ohio,
visible
to
travelers
on
the
highway.
and
the
petitioner
had
knowledge
of
those
highway
signs.
tallmadge
avenue
was
a
statutory
and
municipal
through
or
main
highway
clearly
marked
with
properly
erect
statutory
signs
as
required
by
the
law
of
ohio.
and
under
that
law,
it
was
a
duty
of
travelers,
before
proceeding
onto
tallmadge
avenue
from
the
south
or
the
north
to
bring
the
automobile
to
a
stop
and
to
yield
the
right
of
way
to
vehicles
on
tallmadge
avenue.
now,
mr.
mcgowan
has
mentioned
the
element
of
lighting,
the
record
of
this
case
by
the
admission
of
the
petitioner
himself
shows
that
this
crossing
was
well
lighted
and
not
only
that,
when
he
stood
there,
two
or
three
feet
west
of
the
west
of
the
westbound
track,
he
stood
within
the
full
rays
of
an
automobile
whose
headlights
were
directed
east
and
were
so
apply
--
were
--
were
signing
right
on
the
petitioner
and
the
photographs
and
the
plots
show
the
location
of
the
lights
in
this
area.
the
atmospheric
and
weather
conditions
were
clear
and
dry.
petitioner
was
an
experienced
watchman,
he
had
worked
at
this
crossing
for
about
seven
years
and
for
the
past
three
years
he
had
worked
at
night
from
11:00
p.m.
to
6:00
a.m.
--
7:00
a.m.
petitioner
was
in
good
health
and
in
full
possession
of
his
mental
and
physical
faculties.
respondent
has
provided
the
petitioner
with
lanterns,
fuses,
whistles
and
other
safety
devices.
petitioner
was
familiar
with
the
train
schedules
and
knew
when
and
how
to
look
for
the
approach
of
trains.
the
train
involved
in
this
accident
only
incidentally,
consisted
of
a
steam
engine,
80
gondola
cars
having
a
weight
of
--
having
a
height
of
seven
to
eight
feet
and
was
moving
the
speed
of
12
to
18
miles
per
hour.
the
duties
which
petitioner
was
performing
at
this
time
were
no
different
than
those
which
he
had
performed
for
many,
many
years.
now,
petitioner
was
standing
as
has
been
indicated,
at
the
west
side
of
the
tracks
and
in
the
position
so
testified
by
him.
and
while
in
that
position,
keeping
in
mind
that
his
claim,
that
his
attention
was
diverted
to
a
westbound
train
coming
from
this.
if
he
was
in
that
position
as
he
says
he
was,
then
all
he
needed
to
do
was
to
look
at
the
signal
block
to
the
west
and
to
the
signal
pole
with
the
light
on
at
the
shanty
and
observe
the
presence
of
a
train.
not
only
that,
he
had
not
heard
any
whistle,
he
knew
that
a
train
had
left
ravenna,
a
distance
of
some
15
or
18
miles,
if
i
recall.
now,
what
happened?
plaintiffs
--
petitioner
says
this,
he
says
that
as
he
stood
there,
he
looked
to
his
right
or
to
the
west
and
in
so
doing,
he
would
have
to
look
right
at
home
avenue.
and
when
he
looked
at
home
avenue,
he
saw
vehicles
proceeding
northerly
on
home
avenue,
come
up
to
the
crossing
and
stop,
pursuant
to
the
flashers
and
the
other
signals
there
existing.
he
says
this,
that
after
he
saw
the
caboose
back
at
home
avenue
crossing
or
about
100
feet
from
where
he
was,
if
that
be
true
and
he
says
he
looked
at
the
block
signal,
then
he
could
have
seen
that
there
was
no
westbound
train
approaching
at
that
time.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
lawsuit,
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
respondent
in
anyway
violated
any
federal
or
state
or
local
law
or
any
applicable
rule
or
regulation.
no
watchman
had
ever
been
injured
or
killed
on
this
process,
nor
was
their
any
evidence
that
there
had
been
any
other
or
similar
occurrence.
now,
what
happened,
what
was
the
cause
of
this
accident?
the
cause
of
this
accident
was
simply
this
--
mr.
william
a.
kelly
i
interpret
that
in
this
fashion,
your
honor.
this
witness
used
the
expression,
“jumping
the
gun.”
now,
this
petitioner
had
worked
on
this
crossing
for
seven
years
and
at
nighttime
and
at
daytime.
he
didn't
testify
and
there
was
no
evidence,
there's
no
evidence
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
a
person
who
would
be
travelling
northerly
on
home
avenue,
approaching
tallmadge
avenue,
would
suddenly
cut
to
the
left
and
move
in
on
this
15-foot
strip,
that's
my
interpretation
of
that
statement.
if
that
had
been
a
practice,
if
that
had
existed,
if
that
had
happened
in
the
past,
certainly
the
plaintiff
or
the
petitioner
would
have
had
some
knowledge
of
that
fact.
jumping
the
gun,
i
assume
is
nothing
more
or
less
in
what
we
see
people
do
when
they
come
up
to
a
--
a
stop
sign
or
a
railroad
crossing,
somebody
is
in
a
hurry
to
get
out
ahead
of
the
procession.
now
what
happened
here?
here,
we
have
an
admitted,
intoxicated
driver,
a
hit-skip
driver,
the
testimony
shows
that
he
pulled
up
within
that
line
of
traffic
and
he
was
in
the
second
or
the
third
or
fourth
car,
south
of
the
railroad
crossing.
there
were
other
cars
back
of
him,
now
what
does
he
do?
all
of
a
sudden
after
the
caboose
cleared
home
avenue
crossing,
this
man
takes
off
and
he
goes
up
and
the
record
shows
this,
the
record
showed,
he
goes
up
about
to
the
first
rail
of
the
most
westerly
track
and
then
he
suddenly
swings
to
the
left
and
runs
right
into
the
petitioner,
turns
off
his
light
and
speeds
away
in
the
nighttime.
he
was
intoxicated
and
the
record
so
show.
now
when
this
man
did
that,
he
violated
and
this
as
appears
in
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
so
found
and
mr.
mcgowan
does
not
dispute
it,
this
man
violated
five
traffic
regulations
or
laws
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
yet,
we
are
charged
with
the
failure
to
foresee
conduct
of
that
kind.
now,
that's
his
lawsuit,
gentlemen.
this
court
has
said
the
access
that
negligence
is
a
basis
of
liability.
furthermore,
it
is
the
law
that
there
must
be
causation
between
negligence
and
injury
or
death.
any
way
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
can
it
be
said
that
the
railroad
company,
the
employer
here,
failed
to
exercise
his
judgment?
it's
common
sense,
its
fair
beliefs
in
not
providing
this
man
with
a
safe
place
to
work.
it
is
significant
that
over
all
the
years
so
far
as
i
can
find
and
apparently
so
far
as
mr.
mcgowan
has
not
able
to
find
any
cases
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
a
watchman
has
a
right
to
recover
damage
or
has
a
right
to
submit
his
case
to
jury
under
circumstances
such
as
we
have
on
this
case.
the
absence
of
such
cases,
indicate
it's
rather
absurdity
of
it.
on
the
contrary
of
that
--
mr.
william
a.
kelly
no,
your
honor.
sometimes
the
public
utilities
commission
makes
an
order
requiring
a
watchman
to
be
maintained
at
certain
crossings,
but
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
any
such
order
was
made
by
the
utilities
commission
as
to
--
with
respect
to
this
particular
crossing.
now,
briefly
and
i
shall
close.
we
have
been
able
to
find
and
we
cite
in
our
brief,
three
cases
in
which
two
in
north
carolina
and
two
in
ohio
for
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
before,
your
honor,
judge
potter
was
on
that
court
in
which
the
court
held
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
was
no
liability
upon
the
part
of
the
railroad
company
for
injuries
sustained
by
a
watchman
or
a
member
of
a
train
crew
even,
due
to
the
conduct
of
a
traveler
on
the
highway
who
comes
out
in
the
light
or
out
of
the
daytime
and
runs
into
a
railroad
employee.
now,
some
mention
has
been
made
by
mr.
mcgowan
about
the
cahill
case.
that
can
be
answered
very
briefly
and
simple
that
cahill
case
was
simply
a
case
where
a
21-year
old
inexperienced
brakeman,
was
a
member
of
a
train
crew
and
working
and
switching
operations
in
a
street,
i
believe,
up
in
new
haven
and
he
was
injured
by
a
traveler
on
the
highway
or
motorist
on
the
highway.
in
that
case,
there
was
evidence
of
--
of
nine
similar
prior
accidents.
we
do
not
have
any
of
those
elements
in
this
case.
now,
the
sole
proximate
cause
of
this
accident
was
a
negligence
of
this
drunken
driver,
the
only
person
who
was
negligent
was
this
drunken
driver
and
therefore,
is
it
any
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
can
conclude
it?
and
why
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
a.
kelly
the
only
way
i
could
answer
that,
your
honor,
is
by
referring
to
page
4
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner,
the
reply
brief.
it
--
i'll
look
down.
in
other
words,
keeping
in
mind
that
petitioner
had
the
opportunity
to
see
and
did
see
there
was
no
question
about
this
in
his
record.
traffic
on
home
avenue,
the
only
thing
that's
left
as
i
view
this
case,
is
whether
or
not
it
can
be
said
that
there
is
a
jury
question
because
of
the
failure
of
the
railroad
company
to
have
another
watchman
somewhere.
and
so
i
close
and
i
ask
this
rhetorical
question,
is
it
to
be
the
law
of
this
court
applicable
to
fela
cases
that
a
railroad
employer
shall
respond
in
damages
because
of
a
failure
to
have
a
watchman
to
watch
the
watchman?
thank
you.
