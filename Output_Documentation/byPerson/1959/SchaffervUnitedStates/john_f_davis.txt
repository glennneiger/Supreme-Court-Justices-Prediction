mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
it
is
stated
at
page
9
and
10
that
the
government
has
grossly
misstated
the
procedural
settings
in
which
the
question
of
improper
joinder
arises.
this
is
enlarged
upon
on
the
following
page.
i
assume
that
an
accusation
for
that
kind
is
not
likely
made
and
rather,
the
point
is,
itself,
in
part
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
responded
to,
if
only
to
give
the
court
the
citations
in
the
records
which
we
rely
upon
in
making
the
statement
which
we
made.
the
court
will
have
to
look
at
the
record
to
know
whether
the
government
has
grossly
misstated
the
procedural
setting,
so
--
and
i
don't
think
that
it
is
good
use
of
time
to
do
so
during
the
argument.
if
i
may,
i
will
give
the
page
references
in
the
printed
records,
which
sustain
the
position,
which
we've
taken.

page

page

(a).
mr.
john
f.
davis
whether
them
--
that's
right.
i
--
i
think
it
is
not
important
to
argue
the
point
on
its
merits
because
i
can
see
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
do
justice
and
see
that
the
fair
trial
has
given
whether
a
motion
is
made
or
not,
but
when
the
statement
like
this
is
made
in
--
in
the
counsel's
brief,
i
assume
that
it's
--
it
should
be
replied
to.
there
was,
by
the
way,
a
motion
for
new
trial
made
after
the
verdict.
they
renewed
their
--
at
that
time,
they
renewed
their
motion
for
judgment
and
made
a
motion
for
new
trial,
but
there
was
no
motion
before
the
verdict.
now,
in
a
case
such
as
this,
the
theories
of
law
in
the
pleadings
and
precedents,
i
think,
i'm
pretty
useless
unless
they
are
applied
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
i
think
it
is
futile
to
argue
about
improper
joinder
without
reference
to
the
nature
of
the
transactions,
which
are
here
involved.
but
basically,
the
question
is
whether
or
not,
these
petitioners
received
a
fair
trial
when
they
were
tried
together
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
conspiracy
count
was
found
not
to
be
sufficiently
supported
to
go
to
the
jury.
i
think
the
best
starting
point
in
this
case
is
to
look
at
the
indictments
which
are
reprinted
at
page
5
(a),
which
is
repeated
to
5
(a)
to
7
(a)
of
the
--
of
the
record.
the
indictments
are
simple
indictment
in
four
counts,
the
first
three
of
these
counts
charge
the
substantive
effect
of
transporting
and
causing
to
the
be
transported
in
--
in
interstate
commerce,
goods
--
stolen
goods
to
a
value
in
excess
of
$5,000.
and
those
charged
in
the
first
count
are
the
three
stracuzzas,
anthony,
mario
and
dorothy
together
with
the
petitioner
--
one
of
the
petitioner
--
two
of
the
petitioners
here,
max
and
norman
schaffer,
who
maintained
a
clothing
store
in
lebanon,
pennsylvania.
the
second
count
is
identical
with
the
first,
except
that
the
owner
of
the
store
who
received
the
goods
was
benjamin
marco
and
the
third
count,
again
is
identical
with
the
first
two,
except
that
the
hyman
karp
is
the
store
owner
who
had
received
the
stolen
goods.
the
fourth
count
was
the
conspiracy
count
which
tied
all
of
them
together
as
a
--
as
a
general
conspiracy
and
as
to
which
the
court
found
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
go
the
jury.
on
page
8
(a)
is
a
second
indictment,
which
also
charges
conspiracy,
this
time
a
conspiracy
to
steal
goods
from
interstate
commerce
and
--
but
there
is
only
a
conspiracy
charge
here
and
this
indictment
was
dismissed
at
the
same
time
that
the
count
on
conspiracy
in
the
first
indictment
was
dismissed
and
it
really
raises
no
different
questions.
now,
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
the
stracuzzas
were
engaged
in
buying
stolen
property
from
truck
drivers
in
new
york
city
and
they
were
selling
this
property
from
a
establishment
they
maintained
in
new
york
city
to
the
owners
of
clothing
stores,
operated
by
the
two
schaffers
in
lebanon,
pennsylvania,
by
mr.
karp
in
fall
river,
massachusetts
and
by
mr.
marco
in
bluefield,
west
virginia.
the
evidence
showed
that
these
purchases
must
have
known
that
the
merchandise
they
received
was
stolen.
they
contracted
to
buy
it
at
a
predetermined
percentage
of
its
wholesale
price
either
55%
or
60%
or
65%
as
the
case
may
be.
the
stracuzzas
reshipped
to
these
buyers
in
interstate
commerce,
in
lots,
each
one
of
which
was
less
than
$5,000
in
value.
however,
during
the
period
of
two
and
a
half
months,
which
is
covered
by
this
indictment,
each
purchaser
purchased
more
than
$5,000
dollars
worth
of
--
of
property.
and
this
is
specifically
stipulated
by
each
one
of
the
defendants
at
the
trial,
example
form
of
the
stipulation
appearing
on
page
21
(a)
of
the
record,
where
it
is
specifically
stated
that
the
aggregate
value
of
the
property
shipped
to
the
schaffers
was
in
excess
of
$5,000.
actually,
the
record
shows
that
the
schaffers
received
something
like
$19,000
of
property,
that
mr.
karp
received
$17,000,
and
that
mr.
marco
received
about
$23,000
worth
of
property.
i
think
that
the
order
of
the
presentation
of
proof
is
significant
in
this
case,
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
severance
should've
been
ordered.
the
nature
of
the
proof
was
this.
first,
anthony
stracuzza,
who
had
pleaded
guilty,
testified
for
the
government
and
he
described
the
overall
nature
of
the
entire
transaction
showing
that
the
goods
were
stolen
and
received
by
him
and
his
brother
and
was
sold
to
these
individual
store
owners,
with
no
attempt
being
made
to
--
to
hide
the
--
the
source
of
the
--
of
the
goods.
his
testimony
and
cross-examination,
covered
about
a
week
of
time.
since
he
was
an
accomplice,
he
was
more
than
an
accomplice,
he
was
really
the
heart
of
the
whole
transaction
and
was
far
from
a
trustworthy
person,
the
government
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
substantiate
his
testimony.
and
it
proceeded
to
do
so
with
evidence
from
fbi
agents
who
had
kept
his
place
under
surveillance
and
who
had
also
checked
the
receipt
of
the
goods
in
the
various
stores.
and
was
also
substantiated
by
evidence
from
the
transporting
agencies
who
testified
as
to
the
property
being
stolen
from
them,
however,
the
evidence
as
introduced,
showed
little
or
no
relationships
between
the
individual
petitioners
who
are
here
and
on
that
basis,
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
determined
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case,
that
the
government
had
not
made
out
an
overall
conspiracy.
and
he
took
that
account
away
from
--
from
the
--
from
the
jury
and
submitted
the
remainder
of
the
case
to
the
jury.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not,
it
was
possible
for
the
jury
to
distinguish
the
evidence
between
the
individual
dependents
and
the
judge
was
very
clear
in
his
statements
that
he
saw
no
difficulty
in
it
and
that
he
would
cover
up
with
instructions.
now,
our
first
problem
is
the
application
of
the
rule,
as
to
joinder,
to
this
set
of
facts.
now,
the
rule
--
our
present
rule
is
8
(b)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
set
forth
at
page
3
of
the
government's
brief
and
we
are
concerned
with
joinder
of
defendants.
now,
this
rule
permits
the
joinder
of
defendants
charged
to
have
participated
in
the
same
act
or
transaction,
or
in
the
same
series
of
acts
or
transactions.
the
rule
was
adopted,
as
this
court
well
knows
pursuant
to
the
advice
by
this
court
--
pursuant
to
the
advice
of
an
advisory
committee,
who
in
then
note
state
that
the
purpose
of
this
rule
was
to
adopt
the
more
lenient
position
on
joinder
of
defendants,
which
had
been
followed
by
the
fifth
and
the
second
circuit
as
distinguished
from
a
limited
rule
as
the
joinder
of
defendants,
which
had
received
recognition
in
some
other
circuits.
and
it
was
in
that
light
as
a
--
as
a
purposeful
adopting
of
a
more
lenient
rule
that
the
--
the
rule
was
submitted
to
this
court
and
adopted.
at
the
same
time,
of
course,
rule
14
was
adopted
and
rule
14
is
the
rule
which
protects
the
defendants
from
any
possible
prejudice
from
the
relaxation
with
respect
to
the
rule
of
joinder.
rule
14
provides
that
if
the
defendant
or
the
government
is
prejudiced
by
a
joinder
of
offences,
then
the
trial
court
shall
take
appropriate
action,
either
through
severance
or
otherwise,
to
protect
the
--
to
protect
the
parties.
now,
the
question
is
an
application
of
this
general
rule
to
this
factual
situation.
is
this
is
a
series
of
transactions
which
can
properly
be
joined
in
a
single
indictment?
and
basically,
i
think
the
way
it
should
be
approached
--
i
think
it
falls
within
the
language
of
the
rule
and
i
think
that
the
approach
that
should
be
taken
to
it
is
--
can
--
is
this
the
kind
of
a
case
--
is
this
the
kind
of
a
trial
where
the
individual
defendants
can
be
given
a
fair
trial,
when
they
are
tried
together
or
is
the
nature
of
case
such,
that
it
must
be
separate
and
have
separate
trials?
there
are
really
four
cases
in
this
court
that
--
that
deal
specifically
with
this
type
of
problem
and
they
go
to
one
land
to
the
other
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that,
they
can
be
distinguished
on
--
on
their
facts,
whether
or
not,
as
the
court
would
look
at
them,
it
is
possible
for
--
or
not
whether
it's
possible,
but
whether
there
is
prejudice
to
the
--
to
the
defendants,
whether
it
appears
that
prejudice
would
occur,
if
they
were
tried
together.
the
kotteakos
case,
which
is
one
of
the
most
recent
cases,
is
a
case
where
it
was
felt
that
they
should
not
have
been
tried
together,
because
in
that
case,
there
were
32
persons
which
would
--
who
were
charged
with
conspiracy,
involved
eight
separate
groups
of
transactions
and
the
court
felt
that
in
that
--
in
that
setting,
it
was
impossible
for
a
jury
to
separate
the
--
separate
the
matter
out.
i
have
--
i
think
that
if
the
court
will
look
at
this
record
and
--
and
notice
that
the
kind
of
testimony
that
was
introduced,
the
nature
of
the
proof,
that
it
will
become
apparent
that
there
isn't
any
fuzz
in
this,
as
to
--
as
to
which
defendant
the
proof
applies
to.
the
--
the
proof
is
--
the
proof
that
stracuzza
gave
in
the
first
place,
dealt
with
the
first
pile
of
that
transaction
upon
--
in
the
--
in
the
beginning,
that
is
the
nature
where
the
goods
came
from,
it
obviously
applies
to
all
of
the
defendants.
and
then
he
dealt
with
his
dealings
with
each
one
in
turn.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
not
on
the
basis
of
--
of
this
joinder,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
basically
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
both
the
berger
case
and
kotteakos
case
or
that
case.
in
both
of
those
cases,
it
went
to
the
jury
on
a
conspiracy.
there
was
no
question,
they
couldn't
have
been
severed
because
there
was
an
issue
of
--
of
conspiracy
and
it
went
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
it
was
charged
as
a
single
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
so
that
they
were
tied
together,
as
in
this
case,
with
a
charge
of
a
general
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
if
there's
a
series
of
eight
conspiracies,
instead
of
one
conspiracy
in
effect,
but
it
went
to
the
--
but
in
answer
to
--
to
your
honor's
first
question,
it
--
it
couldn't
have
been
severed,
before
it
went
to
the
--
before
the
case
was
tried
because
there
was,
as
in
this
case,
a
generally
conspiracy
charge.
the
same
is
true
of
the
--
of
the
berger
case
that
went
to
the
jury
as
a
single
conspiracy,
but
the
court,
in
reviewing
it,
said
that
the
evidence
wouldn't
support
a
charge
of
the
single
conspiracy,
that
the
most
that
it
would
prove
would
be
two
conspiracies
in
the
berger
case.
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
other
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
there
were
questions
of
--
of
proper
instruction.
there's
no
question
about
proper
instruction
here.
now,
in
the
mcelroy
case,
they
were
all
substantive
counts
that
were
charged.
there
was
no
question
of
tying
together
with
a
conspiracy.
they
were
just
a
series
of
substantive
counts,
two
attempt
to
murder
and
--
and
two
acts
of
arson.
and
they
were
tied
together
in
time
and
place,
but
not
all
the
defendants
were
involved
in
each
of
the
counts.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
the
--
there
was
an
improper
joinder,
because
they
felt
that
there
was
not
enough
relationship
between
the
series
of
acts
which
was
involved.
but
here,
the
--
it
makes
--
it
makes
good
sense,
both
from
the
point
of
the
defendant
and
the
point
of
view
of
the
government,
but
this
kind
of
a
trial
to
be
carried
on
at
one
time.
to
--
to
try
the
case
first
against
the
stracuzzas
and
--
and
the
schaffers,
maybe
getting
a
convection
and
maybe
not,
then
to
try
the
case
against
the
stracuzzas
and
--
and
karp
and
then
against
the
stracuzzas
and
--
and
marco
would
--
would
certainly
harass
the
stracuzzas,
if
nobody
else
and
yet
they
were
involved
in
each
one
of
these
--
in
these
transactions.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
i
think
that
this
is
--
these
participants
in
a
series
of
acts
of
transactions
and
therefore,
it's
--
it's
an
appropriate
joinder.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
and
we
make
this
the
second
--
the
second
point
that
whether
this
be
sold
or
not,
that
at
the
time
the
government
commenced
the
trial,
there
was
a
proper
joinder,
because
of
the
conspiracy
count.
and
when
that
was
thrown
out,
then
the
remedy
was
to
force
severance
if
the
judge
felt
that
at
that
time,
there
was
prejudice.
and
that
time,
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
defendants
to
--
to
show
why
they
were
prejudiced
and
if
they
did
--
couldn't
was
--
there,
it
was
entirely
proper
to
continue
the
case
and
that's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
entire
trial
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
your
honor.
the
entire
trial
--
the
--
that
the
entire
government's
evidence
was
in
and
the
defendants
put
in
no
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
they
were
little
over
two
weeks.
i
can't
remember
whether
it
was
seven
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
six
days
week
to
five
days.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
were
no
more
days
of
trial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
government
rested
and
the
defendant
put
in
no
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
accusation
is
--
is
made.
it's
--
it's
been
denied
here
today.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
the
counsel
said
that
he
wasn't
accusing
the
government
of
bad
faith
in
sort
of
case,
but
he
was
saying
it
opened
the
way
up
to
bad
faith.
and
in
reply
to
that,
i
would
say
that
rule
14
would
protect
against
--
which
allows
the
--
the
trial
court
to
prevent
prejudice,
would
protect
against
bad
faith.
sorry,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
you
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
they
offered
no
evidence
at
all.
they
--
they
were
attempting
to
get
the
judgment
--
to
get
the
whole
case
taken
away
from
the
jury,
before
it
went
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right
entirely.
well,
this
makes
no
difference,
but
i
would
say
that
they
introduced
the
stipulations
as
to
value
after
the
government's
case
was
tried
and
a
stipulation
as
to
how
some
other
testimony
would
be
--
would
appear,
if
it
were
presented,
but
except
for
those
stipulations,
there
was
no
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there's
the
pointer
case.
the
pointer
case
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
at
that
time,
they
--
they
used
the
same
joinder.
both
mcelroy
and
pointer
rely
on
the
same
--
on
the
same
provision
of
law
as
to
whether
it's
proper
joinder.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
no,
there
isn't.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
uses
this
in
pointer.
i
think
pointer
is
the
first
one
and
--
and
that
--
that
in
--
in
mcelroy,
he
accepts
the
theories
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
of
--
of
judge
harlan
in
pointer.
and
--
but
distinguishes
the
case.
with
respect
to
the
prejudice
to
the
defendants
in
the
--
in
the
evidence
that
--
which
was
in
the
case,
i
read
the
entire
transcript
not
only
the
record
here
and
the
only
item
that
i
find
there
and
it's
referred
to
in
--
in
the
briefs,
where
there
could
be
confusion
as
to
which
defendant,
particular
evidence
was
introduced
with
respect
to,
was
when
a
federal
bureau
of
investigation's
agent
testified
that
mr.
karp
had
told
him
that
he
had
seen
the
schaffers,
who
are
also
petitioners,
karp
is
one
of
the
defendant,
that
he
had
seen
them
at
one
of
these
places
of
business.
now
technically,
i
think
this
evidence
cannot
be
introduced
against
the
schaffers
because
this
is
hearsay
evidence
and
made
out
of
that
presence
and
i
think
it
is
not
proper
evidence
against
the
schaffers.
it
came
in
under
instructions,
specific
instructions,
that
it
was
to
be
used
against
karp
only.
it
came
in
without
any
objection
from
the
schaffers
and
what
is
more,
it
is
entirely
unprejudicial
to
the
schaffers
because
they
claimed,
time
and
time
again,
that
they
were
at
this
--
these
places
of
business
and
that
they
did
buy
goods
there.
and
for
someone
to
say
that
they
were
seen
at
a
place
where
they
insist
that
they
were,
can
hardly
do
them
damage.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
he
didn't
know,
because
he
--
he
discussed
the
problems
of
value
when
he
said,
“now,
i'm
going
to
withhold
judgment
on
your
motion
for
dismissal
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
until
i
hear
the
rest
and
i
warn
you.”
he
said.
so
he
must
--
i
warn
you
if
go
ahead
that
you
may
hurt
yourselves
rather
than
help
yourselves
by
going
ahead
with
more
evidence.
he
was
thinking
then
of
the
question
of
value.
the
aggregation
of
values
that
cross-examination
might
help
on
that
problem.
so
he
said,
“if
you
want
to
go
--
i
--
i
warn
you,
you
--
you
may
hurt
yourselves,
but
i'm
not
going
to
make
a
judgment
on
your
motion
at
the
present
time.”
and
then
they
rested.
they
didn't
go
ahead
with
any
addition.
mr.
john
f.
davis
11
to
21
(a).
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
motion
is
formalized
on
page
21
(a),
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that's
--
that's
a
hard
question
to
answer.
it's
a
question
of
judgment.
the
issue
and
really
the
only
issue
which
they
were
trying
out,
and
this
i
say
from
reading
the
record,
there's
no
single
place
you
can
--
you
can
find
it.
the
only
issue
they
were
trying
out
with
guilty
knowledge
of
these
individual
store
buyers.
there
was
no
question
that
they
bought
large
quantities
of
material
and
they
bought
them
from
the
stracuzzas.
there's
no
question
that
the
stracuzzas
stole
this
stuff.
mr.
john
f.
davis
which,
that
this
is
the
only
issue?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
just
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
on
all
--
well,
on
the
nature
of
their
cross
exam
--
the
nature
of
the
briefs,
the
stipulation
that
they
received
stolen
goods
from
the
stracuzzas,
the
question
that
--
well,
there's
no
contradiction
that
the
stracuzzas
stolen
the
--
stole
the
goods,
i
--
that's
the
only
issue
really
that
there
was
left
in
the
case.
as
i
say,
this
is
a
question
of
judgment
and
people
can
quiver
with
it.
they
can
talk
about
whether
there's
sufficient
evidence
and
things
like
that,
but
basically,
that's
what
the
trial
was
about
as
i
read
the
transcript,
whether
or
not,
these
people
had
any
guilty
knowledge
that
the
materials
they
were
receiving
were
stolen.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
said
that
the
evidence
was
all
introduced
in
a
--
in
an
orderly
way
that
it
was
easily
attributable
to
the
individual
defendants
and
that
there
was
--
and
may
i
say
this,
that
we
are
fortunate
in
this
case
in
having
the
charge
of
the
court
to
the
jury
here,
set
out
in
full
from
pages
58
to
about
60
or
so
of
the
--
of
the
brief.
and
i
--
i
think
that
as
a
method
for
this
court
to
determine
the
--
the
general
nature
of
what
this
evidence
was,
how
well
it
could
be
divided,
that
this
charge
of
the
judge
to
the
jury,
which
is
one
of
the
charges
that
outlines
the
evidence,
gives
a
very
--
a
very
fair
idea
of
what
the
nature
of
the
evidence
was.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
--
it's
particularly
convenient
to
have
it
printed
too,
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
when
single
--
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
so.
let
me
--
let
me
explain
the
context
in
which
this
was
done.
this
was
really
on
the
second
point
that
i
am
coming
to,
with
the
question
of
aggregating
the
shipments,
so
as
to
make
up
a
total
of
$5,000,
before
you
get
federal
jurisdiction.
and
the
judge
had
been
worried
because
the
only
court
of
appeals
case
which
was
not
in
this
circuit,
but
in
another
circuit,
had
indicated
that
you
couldn't
add
them
together
unless
there
were
a
--
unless
there
were
some
agreement
that
all
of
this
stuff
should
be
shipped.
that's
the
--
that's
the
fourth
circuit.
it's
--
it's
a
dictum
in
the
case,
but
the
fourth
circuit
had
said
this.
and
judge
murphy
was
disturbed
about
the
question
of
whether
the
government's
case
was
--
fell
within
that
and
how
he
should
--
how
he
should
decide
this
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
what
he
was
really
saying
to
the
defendants
was
i
don't
know
to
how
i'm
going
to
decide
this
question
of
law,
but
if
you
go
ahead
with
evidence
and
if
it
--
if
it
turns
out
that
we've
--
that
there
are
shipments,
if
the
shipments
in
one
lot
are
over
$5,000,
by
then,
you
will
have
done
yourself
some
harm.
now,
this
isn't
done
before
the
jury
--
this
is
to
the
--
to
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
to
the
lawyers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
he's
just
saying
you
--
you
know
how
to
try
your
own
case,
but
if
you
--
if
you
make
it
--
if
you
make
this
case,
well
then,
this
problem
will
--
will
disappear.
and
that's
all
he's
doing.
he's
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he's
not
scaring
them
or
anything.
he
is
--
he
is
wanting
them
really.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
suppose
that
they
put
mr.
schaffer
on
the
stand
to
prove
his
innocence
and
in
cross-examination
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
why,
they
--
then
the
court
no
longer
has
his
legal
problem
before
it.
then
that's
--
that's
what
judge
murphy
was
saying
to
them,
i
think.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
i
am
coming
to
that
and
i
don't
think
it
does.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
come
--
i
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
that
point.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
most
of
these
are
checks
as
--
as
stated
by
the
--
by
the
judge
in
response
with
checks
on
these
individual
defendants
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
of
the
others
--
many
of
the
other
exhibits
were
the
shipping
papers
though
--
to
get
the
term
that's
used
in
--
in
the
record,
but
it's
the
manifest
of
the
shipping
papers
that
went
with
the
goods.
what
happened
was
that
they'd
get
a
bale
of
goods
that
were
stolen
from
a
truck
and
it
would
have
a
bill
of
lading,
in
effect.
i'm
not
using
the
right
terms
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
invoice
of
some
kind,
which
would
show
the
manufacture
and
the
person
to
whom
it
was
to
go
and
the
price
and
the
description
of
the
things.
and
the
stracuzzas
would
cut
of
the
portion
of
it,
which
showed
the
people
who
it
was
going
to.
but
they
would
leave
the
rest
of
this
invoice
in
the
bale,
when
they
send
it
on
to
these
clothing
merchants,
so
that
the
clothing
merchants
--
this
people
didn't
trust
each
other
very
fair,
so
if
the
clothing
merchants
would
know
what
the
wholesale
value
was
and
could
pay
the
50%,
60%,
65%
of
the
--
of
the
price.
well,
there
were
hundreds,
hundreds
of
these
invoices
introduced
in
--
in
the
evidence,
primarily
to
show
that
the
recipients
must've
realized
that
this,
if
nothing
else,
shows
that
the
goods
were
stolen
goods.
and
those
take
up
the
large
number
of
the
exhibits.
i
don't
think
that
any
of
the
exhibits
really
raise
any
problem
about
crossing
a
line
between
the
guilty
knowledge
of
one
independent
and
the
other.
i
think
they're
all
--
all
free.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
i
would
think
that
they
were
probably
15
--
maybe
20.
but
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
were
three
separate
trial
counsels.
each
--
each
--
rather
there's
the
two
schaffers
--
we've
treated
the
two
schaffers
as
one
here
and
i
think,
it's
easy
--
these
two
schaffers
had
one
and
mr.
karp
and
mr.
marco
each
had
--
had
one.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
principal
witness,
anthony
stracuzza,
was
extensively
cross-examined
by
each
of
them
and
--
but
they
wouldn't
--
each
of
them
cross-examined
--
an
fbi
agent
would've
checked
mr.
karp's
store
and
will
check
the
receipt
of
--
of
these
goods
at
mr.
karp's
place
of
business.
and
as
to
him,
the
cross-examination
would
be
entirely
by
mr.
karp's
lawyer
and
most
of
the
evidence
was
like
that
after
stracuzza
--
after
the
stracuzzas
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
typewritten
pages,
1600
pages.
mr.
john
f.
davis
quite
a
long
trial,
because
the
cross-examination
took
a
--
took
a
long
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
by
stracuzza
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
himself?
well,
he
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
probably
not
half.
he
was
on
for
a
week
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
eight
days,
i
think,
with
the
cross-exam.
he
was
on
about
three
days
on
direct
examination
and
about
three
days
on
cross-examination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
was
pretty
nearly
half
of
the
trial.
well,
he
was
the
--
he
proved
the
case.
i
mean
the
rest
of
the
material
was
just
because
he
is
a
thief
and
--
and
he
had
to
be
--
it
had
to
be
confirmed.
you
couldn't
go
to
the
jury
on
his
testimony
alone.
mr.
john
f.
davis
two
of
them
that
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
leave
that
to
the
second
argument.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
really
that
part
of
the
heart
of
the
--
of
the
second
argument
and
i
do
want
to
get
to
the
aggregating
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
it
is
--
it
is
a
matter
that
we
will
have
to
go
into.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
second
issue
which
mr.
kossman
has
argued
as
the
three
issues
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not,
it
was
proper
to
aggregate
the
shipments
to
each
one
of
these
defendants
in
order
to
reach
the
jurisdictional
amount
of
$5,000.
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
each
one
of
the
individual
shipments
to
each
one
of
these
defendants
was
less
than
$500.
there's
no
proof
in
the
record
of
any
single
shipment
of
over
$5,000.
there
is
a
stipulation
as
to
each
defendant
that
although
the
individual
shipments
are
less
than
$5,000,
the
aggregate
value
of
the
merchandise
shipped
to
him
was
in
excess
of
$5,000.
mr.
john
f.
davis
let
me
refer
you
specifically
to
page
11
of
our
brief.
and
this
quotes
from
the
stipulation
with
the
schaffers,
but
it
is
same
with
the
others
with
changes
in
language,
which
are
not
material.
“it
is
hereby
stipulated
that
the
aggregate
value
of
the
merchandise
consisting
of
ladies
wear
and
apparel,
which
was
transported
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
lebanon,
pennsylvania
to
the
defendants,
max
schaffer
and
norman
schaffer,
during
the
period
from
or
on
or
about
may
15,
up
to
and
including
july
27,
was
in
excess
of
$5,000.
each
shipment
was
a
value
of
less
than
$5,000.”
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
these
are
shipments
from
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
are
shipments
from
--
from
the
stracuzzas
to
--
to
--
and
all
stracuzzas
said
all
them
--
all
of
their
stuff
were
stolen.
i
mean
that
the
stolen
goods,
yes.
i
--
i
hadn't
considered
that
in
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
there's
no
issue
really
that
that's
referring
to
anything
but
stolen
--
but
the
stolen
goods.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
question
of
knowledge
--
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
which
isn't
--
isn't
before
the
court
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
now,
i
think
under
the
statute,
an
argument
could
be
made
that
all
of
these
shipments
to
all
of
the
defendants
could
be
aggregated.
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
here.
we
don't
reach
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
all
we
are
doing
is
aggregating
the
amount
of
shipments
made
to
in
individual
defendant.
i
think
it's
important
to
see
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
appears
at
pages
2
and
3
of
the
--
of
the
government's
brief.
and
the
important
part
is
the
definition
of
value
and
on
the
value
what
is
stated,
that
value
means
the
market
value
referred
to
in
a
single
indictment.
and
that
you
see
--
i
am
sorry,
i've
misread
that.
and
money
referred
to
in
a
single
indictment
shall
constitute
the
value
thereof.
the
entire
--
it
--
it
was
purposely
put
in
there
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
so
that
if
individual
shipments
to
a
--
to
a
defendant
were
less
than
the
jurisdictional
amount,
that
the
entire
amount
which
could
be
properly
joined
together
in
a
single
indictment
could
be
added
together
and
could
be
considered
to
reach
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and
the
question
which
we
have
is
really
only
whether
one,
whether
that's
what
congress
meant
when
it
said
it,
because
there's
really
no
problem
of
--
of
constitutional
law.
these
are
interstate
--
these
are
interstate
shipments.
congress
didn't
have
to
put
any
limitation
on
value
at
all.
it
could've
said
anything
of
value,
shipped
--
that
was
stolen
and
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
could
constitute
a
federal
crime.
it
didn't
choose
to
do
so.
it
felt
that
this
would
be
bringing
the
federal
government
too
much
into
the
--
into
the
field
of
--
that
the
state
should
handle.
and
so
it
did
say
that
the
value
should
be
$5,000.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
what
they
meant
was
that
if
there
should
be
a
series,
the
language
is
used
in
the
reports,
a
series
of
transactions.
now,
i
don't
think
that
that
means
what
the
fourth
circuit
said,
that
it
must
be
a
group
of
transactions
which
were
agreed
to
in
the
beginning.
a
series
seems
to
me
that
the
--
some
transactions
which
are,
in
some
way,
connected
together
in
time,
place,
proximity,
something
to
make
them
related
to
each
other.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
stating
when
they
--
when
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
in
the
andrews
case,
involved
different
defendants.
and
one
of
the
defendants
was
not
connected
with
the
others,
had
received
in
aggregate,
less
than
$5,000
worth,
and
the
court,
threw
that
out,
as
i
think
they
probably
should
under
the
statute.
it's
a
question
again
on
whether
you
aggregate
shipments
to
other
people.
but
the
court
threw
it
out
and
then
they
went
on,
and
this
is
dictum
to
be
sure,
because
they
didn't
have
to
say
it,
but
they
did
say
that
they
felt
that
it
had
to
be
one
scheme
on
one
plan,
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
be
aggregated
under
the
statute.
and
that's
what
gave
judge
--
i
think
that's
wrong.
i
think
that
the
congress
meant
a
--
by
a
series
of
transactions,
something
much
looser
than
a
conspiracy
or
--
or
under
one
contract.
i
think
they
meant
transactions
which
between
the
same
people
and
which
have
--
have
some
relationship
to
each
other
and
that's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
is
so.
from
the
same
--
in
the
--
in
the
steady
course
of
business
between
these
people
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
whether
under
just
one
contract,
or
just
under
individual
sales.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
might
have
--
you
might
have
that
and
--
and
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
bothersome,
if
it
was
spread
over
five
years
or
something
like
that.
you
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
two
and
a
half
months,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
two
and
a
half
months.
mr.
john
f.
davis
two
and
a
half
months.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
well,
some
of
them
were
shattered,
the
over
all
period
is
two
and
a
half
months.
it's
set
forth
in
the
indictment
that
it's
from
may
until
about
july
1st,
the
middle
of
may,
until
about
july
1st.
it's
the
longest
period.
one
of
them
is
--
is
less
than
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
sure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
most
that
there
is
evidence
of
is
that
--
is
the
evidence
i
referred
to
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation's
agent
said
that
karp
told
him
that
he
had
met
the
schaffers
at
one
of
these
places
of
business,
which
would
be
admissible,
as
i
say,
only
against
karp
in
--
in
any
event.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
that's
not
part
of
our
case.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
--
well,
i'm
sure
that
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
--
that
will
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
--
that
was
--
it
was
prepared
and
the
--
the
u.s
attorney
must've
felt
that
he
had
something
more
to
present.
why?
what
happen
to
it?
i
--
i
have
no
--
no
way
of
knowing.
he
had
no
other
evidence
as
to
introduce
as
to
knowledge
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
one
of
the
group
or
the
other.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
in
response
to
the
motion
to
sever
and
i
assume
that
he
must‘ve
thought
he
was
going
to
prove
this
is
in
some
way,
unless
he
--
the
statement
was
made.
well
i
assume,
he
must
have
known
that
he
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
and
the
only
evidence
was
that
the
karp
--
karp
admit
the
schaffers.
there
was
no
evidence
that
marco
admitted
any
of
the
others.
well,
just
looking
at
the
statute
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
clearly
permits
the
aggregation
in
the
situation
like
that
and
that
it
isn't
necessary
that
there
be
a
--
a
plan
or
agreement
and
that
there
really
isn't
any
difference
between
what
the
--
how
the
judge
charge
the
jury.
the
judge
refused
the
charge
to
be
sure
that
was
asked
by
the
defendants
that
there
had
to
be
a
common
plan.
he
said
that
that
wasn't
necessary,
but
i
don't
need
the
court
of
appeals
as
--
as
disagreeing
with
that.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
there
had
to
be
a
contract
that
a
conspiracy
or
anything
like
that.
i
think
that
there
was,
all
the
way
through,
the
idea
was
that
here
with
a
series
of
sales
from
one
source
to
the
--
to
this
--
to
the
--
to
the
clothing
store
and
that
that
was
sufficient
to
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
say
that,
but
that's
--
that's
a
conclusion.
i
mean,
the
--
the
jury
found
them
guilty
of
--
of
receiving
over
$5,000
worth.
it's
all
--
it's
all
one
part.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
all
one
ball
of
wax
and
i
don't
know
how
any
of
it
could
--
could
be
cut
out.
i
mean
it
would
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
there
was
no
such
--
and
there
was
no
such
charge
to
--
to
the
jury.
if
the
jury
--
the
charge
to
the
jury
was
that
there
was
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
find
that
the
--
well,
the
court
reviews
the
evidence
by
the
jury
--
by
the
schaffers,
how
the
evidence
ties
in
with
knowledge,
but
it
was
left
to
the
jury
to
find
whether
or
not
they
knew.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
would
have
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
they
would
have
to
find
that
all
of
it
was
stolen
and
they
had
knowledge
of
it,
or
at
least,
yes,
or
at
least
$5,000.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
but
as
you
read
the
--
as
you
read
the
record,
there's
no
--
all
of
these
--
all
of
the
materials
that
--
that
the
stracuzzas
were
selling
were
stolen.
they
had
no
other
source
to
find.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
evidence
--
the
evidence
is
abundant
that
the
method
of
dealing,
showing
it
was
all
handled
in
the
same
way
with
the
--
with
the
invoices
sent
and
the
discount's
the
same.
i
mean
--
that
if
it's
no
--
there's
no
basis
to
distinguish
between
schaffer
and
another.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it
does.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
and
this
is,
of
course,
left
to
the
jury
to
find.
i
mean
he
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that's
--
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
issue
on
this
part
of
the
case
is
considerably
narrower
than
my
brother
would
have
in
detail.
issue
was
not
whether
the
stracuzzas
--
whether
the
district
judge
should
have
given
the
stracuzzas
sentence,
whether
the
government
should
have
known
across
the
case
against
dorothy
stracuzza.
the
question
here,
although
i'd
be
glad
to
discuss
those
points
before
i
get
through
because
they're
in
the
background
of
this
thing,
but
the
specific
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states
attorney
misconducted
himself
before
the
jury
so
that
the
jury
could
have
missed
the
trial.
there's
very
little
that
i
can
say
on
that.
what's
the
--
what
the
united
states
attorney
has
set
--
said
is
set
forth
at
pages
9
to
10.
everything
that's
objected
to
is
set
forth
on
pages
9
to
10
of
the
record.
this
is
an
answer
to
an
assertion
that
was
made
in
the
trial
that
the
government
had
entered
into
a
deal
with
anthony
stracuzza
under
which
he
would
get
these
other
people
convicted
and
he
and
his
family
would
be
dealt
with
lightly.
there
is
not
a
thread
of
evidence
of
indication
that
the
government
was
buying
urgent
testimony.
anthony
stracuzza
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
whether
it
was
buying
testimony
or
not,
i
do
not
know.
there's
no
question
that
--
i
think
there's
no
question
that
anthony
stracuzza
by
pleading
guilty
and
turning
states
evidence
expected
to
receive
a
lighter
sentence
as
a
result
although
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
wasn't
disappointed.
the
judge
suspended
his
sentence
and
his
brother's
sentence
and
his
wife
as
--
and
his
wife
with
no
part.
and
this
is
what
he
expected
and
this
is
what
he
got.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
don't
know
about
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
i
--
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
your
--
in
your
brief?
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
in
some
cases
the
united
states
attorneys
make
recommendations
with
respect
to
sentences
in
the
southern
district
and
in
some
they
don't.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
am
certain
that
the
united
states
attorney
in
this
case
--
well,
i'm
not
certain
but
i
would
assume
he
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
this
--
that
anthony
stracuzza
testified
in
this
case
for
the
government.
now,
whether
or
not
anthony
stracuzza
should
have
--
should
have
been
punished
for
all
of
his
misdeeds,
whether
the
judge
should
have
given
them
a
sentence
or
whether
it
should
suspend
the
--
the
sentence,
i
don't
know.
i
mean
that's
the
question
--
it's
--
he
is
not
here
for
the
trial.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
united
states
attorney,
when
he
is
accused
of
--
of
--
in
effect
accused
of
making
a
deal
for
30
pieces
of
silver
of
buying
--
buying
testimony,
whether
he
is
entitled
to
reply
as
he
did
in
the
words
which
appear
in
this
record.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
he
was.
i
feel
that
he
was.
i
feel
that
none
of
the
cases
which
counsel
cited
come
anywhere
near
this
when
they
talk
about
misconduct.
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
do
not
only
think
that
this
wasn't
misconduct
which
should
have
read
--
lead
to
a
mistrial,
i
don't
think
this
was
misconduct
at
all.
i
think
this
was
a
perfectly
proper
and
appropriate
thing
for
the
united
states
attorney
to
tell
the
jury
when
he
was
presenting
this
case
to
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
this
is
wrong.
i
don't
know
how
it
took
place.
this
is
the
trial
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
am.
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
--
this
--
let
me
explain
what
this
is,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
before
this
case
came
to
trial,
there
was
a
separate
trial
and
this
comes
from
the
other
trial.
this
was
a
trial
against
the
stracuzzas
and
against
the
truck
drivers
for
stealing
goods
from
interstate
commerce.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
stage
before
this
one.
that
was
the
actual
thefts.
and
in
that
case,
the
stracuzzas
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
what?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
wasn't
conspiracy.
it
was
theft.
it
was
theft
from
interstate
carriers
from
the
pennsylvania
rail
--
from
whoever
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
think
railway
(voice
overlap)
to
start
from
right
is
in
and
trucks
and
things.
mr.
john
f.
davis
against
the
stracuzzas
and
the
truck
drivers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
stage
of
the
--
of
the
larceny
which
occurs
before
the
stracuzzas
get
rid
of
it.
it's
the
stage
where
they
obtained
the
--
obtained
the
property.
and
this
was
tried
in
december
before
this
case
was
reached,
before
the
--
and
actually
before
the
stracuzzas
had
pled
--
pled
to
this
case.
and
in
that
case,
they
pleaded
guilty
as
they
did
in
this
one
and
they
testified
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
thefts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
was
a
federal
prosecution
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
for
stealing
from
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
i
--
all
i
know
about
what
went
on
is
--
is
what
i
see
here.
i
have
the
transcript
of
--
of
the
previous
case.
i
cannot
imagine
how
mr.
cantor
(ph)
could
have
told
the
court
in
that
case.
and
when
these
people
did
get
suspended
sentences,
i
don't
know
how
he
could
have
told
them
that
they
weren't
involved
in
--
maybe
it
--
he
thought
this
was
the
same
transaction
that
these
people
were
engaged
in,
that
this
was
the
same
--
you
know,
that
they've
stolen
and
resold
and
maybe
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
indictments
were
pending,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
these
indictments
were
pending
at
that
time
although
they
hadn't
--
they
hadn't
pledge
with
them
at
that
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
must
be
--
i
--
i
assume,
yes,
that
he
knew
that
this
was
stolen
by
the
stracuzzas.
it
is
known
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
--
that
is
one
thing
to
gather
a
great
many
transactions.
the
stracuzzas
were
in
business
with
themselves
only
two
and
a
half
months
rather
than
a
year
basis
that's
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
were
working
for
berk
and
eisenberg
for
a
while
and
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
then
anthony
--
yes,
they
were
employees
at
that
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
they
were
learning.
and
then
they
went
into
business
with
mr.
berk
only.
then
they
were
in
this
business
by
themselves
which
is
the
one
that's
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
what
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
can't
imagine
why
mr.
cantor
(ph)
said
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
truth
--
truth
is
that
we
do
not
have
that
case
before
us.
that
is
--
that
--
that
is
not
the
--
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
about
whether
or
not
mr.
stracuzza
should
be
sentenced
or
should
go
to
jail.
that's
--
that's
not
the
issue.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
don't
know
why.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
may
--
maybe
i've
been
reminiscing.
maybe
we
should
get
the
transcript
in
this
case.
i
do
not
know
whether
in
this
case
--
and
he's
referring
to
the
stracuzzas
or
who
he's
referring
to
the
truck
drivers
or
who
he's
referring
to.
here
he's
talking
about
--
and
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
transcript
of
the
case
to
know
what
he
was
talking
about.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
this
isn't
our
case
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
is
another
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
this
is
different
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
john
f.
davis
different
prosecuting
attorney,
different
in
thought.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
cantor
(ph)
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
you
mean
who
was
the
united
states
attorney
in
--
in
this
case?
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
moran.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
that
--
that's
right
and
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
--
of
course,
this
--
i
--
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
try
and
get
the
transcript
in
this
--
mr.
davis,
i
wasn't
asking
you
to
try
to
excuse
us.
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
we
should
have
get
the
transcript
of
this
case
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
submit
it
to
the
court
so
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
so
we
can
have
the
entire
transcript
of
the
--
of
what
went
on
here
and
i
want
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
involved
the
first
part
of
the
case.
there
was
no
--
i
don't
know
what
went
on
in
that
case
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
the
goods
whether
if
anyone
knew
that
it
was
an
interstate
disposition
or
maybe
a
local
disposition.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
knew
that
a
thousand
dollars
a
day
goods
was
being
stolen.
he
didn't
know
--
we
don't
know
that
he
knew
anything
about
what
happened
to
the
goods.
maybe
it
was
disposed
of
locally.
maybe
there
was
no
federal
crime
in
connection
with
this
--
his
fault.
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
knew
that
our
petitioner
here,
this
is
not
our
petitioner
here.
we
--
he
didn't
know
anything
about
our
petitioners
here,
let's
say.
he
knew
about
the
stracuzzas
but
they
knew
nothing
so
far
as
i
know
and
i
haven't
gone
on
and
i
haven't
seen
the
transcript.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
any
information
about
the
schaffers
and
mr.
marco
and
mr.
karp.
i
mean
this
was
the
first
part
of
it
and
it
wasn't
part
of
the
case
to
show
the
disposition
because
there,
it
wasn't
an
interstate
shipment
of
stolen
goods.
there,
the
question
was
a
stealing,
a
larceny
of
goods
from
an
interstate
carrier.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
they
would
--
they'd
pleaded
guilty
because
of
--
not
only
buying
and
he
was
in
--
he
was
engaged
in
--
in
stealing
it
in
--
in
effect.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
--
the
case
was
tried
in
1958,
may
--
i
think
it
started
in
may
of
1958.
and
this
is
statement
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
tried
the
case
--
the
case
was
tried
the
previous
december.
whenever
the
--
whenever
the
--
the
indictments
were
filed,
this
particular
case
was
now
--
let
me
--
the
case
which
is
before
the
court
was
tried
in
may
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
may
of
1958.
mr.
john
f.
davis
april
22,
1958.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
this
case
had
previously
been
tried
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
in
december
of
1957.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
--
in
the
transcript
which
i've
read,
it
said
previous
december.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
these
are
the
same
goods,
presumably.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
know
that
they're
identified
but
we
must
assume
they're
the
same
thing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
--
as
far
as
i
know,
and
i
haven't
read
the
transcript
and
this
is
what
one
can
gather
from
the
--
from
the
transcript
of
the
case
i
have
read.
that
--
what
happened
was
that
there
were
two
separate
indictments.
they
indicted
the
stracuzzas
and
the
truck
drivers
for
stealing
these
goods
from
interstate
carriers.
they
were
being
shipped
by
manufacturers
to
various
consignees
and
the
stracuzzas
and
the
truck
drivers
stole
these
goods
from
interstate
carriers,
which
is
a
--
which
is
a
separate
crime
than
--
than
one
we
have
here.
that
was
tried
first.
and
in
the
records
which
i
have
read,
it
is
referred
to
as
having
been
tried
in
december.
that's
--
that's
the
way
it
was
described.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
but
our
indictments
were
handed
down
before
this
trial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
were
--
they
were
handed
down
long
before
the
trial
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
so
that
they
were
on
record.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
that
the
--
the
indictment
in
our
case
was
found
and
was
pending
at
the
time
of
this
previous
trial.
mr.
cantor
(ph)
can't
explain
this
on
the
ground
that
there
weren't
indictments
pending
at
the
time
he
made
this
statement.
they
were
indictments
pending.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
there
were
four
in
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
they
were
four
federal
indictments.
mr.
john
f.
davis
one
of
them
i've
--
one
of
them
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
but
there
is
this
one
for
theft
from
the
--
that
i'm
speaking
of
this
as
being
tried
in
december.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
one
--
this
footnote
applies.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
--
the
two
indictments
which
are
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
at
the
time
--
that
--
of
sentencing,
of
the
--
suspension
of
sentence,
it
appears
that
there
was
a
third
indictment
against
the
stracuzzas
along
that
they
pled
guilty
to
at
the
same
time
it's
consecutively
numbered
with
these
two
that
are
before
us.
it
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
don't
know
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
that
--
they're
not
in
this
printed
record.
no,
they're
in
the
transcripts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
as
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
those
--
those
are
present
in
the
files
of
the
court
and
it
would
be
very
easy
to
give
you
the
references
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
to
the
transcript.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
was
refused,
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
this
is
part
of
the
transcript,
mr.
justice
black.
i've
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
the
previous
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
do
you
think
it's
in
the
transcripts?
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was
proffered.
but
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
sent
down
with
the
transcripts
or
not.
the
counsel
says
that
it
was
sent
down.
i
don't
know
--
i
didn't
know
whether
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
yes
they
are.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
author
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
author
would
in
there
but
whether
or
not
the
actual
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
no,
i
don't
know.
as
i
say,
i
don't
know.
the
counsel
says
it
is
here.
it
was
offered
and
rejected
and
whether
they
sent
it
down
as
they
--
whether
they
made
an
offer
of
proof
or
some
way
to
get
into
the
record,
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
don't
know
at
this
stage.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
quite.
i
wanted
to
say
one
more
thing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
is
the
only
question
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
there
is
in
this
part.
all
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
as
far
as
the
government
not
calling
mario
and
not
calling
dorothy
stracuzza,
the
government
wasn't
--
what
the
government
found
to
prove
this
case,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation's
agents
and
the
--
the
witnesses
for
the
railroads.
it
felt
it
proved
its
case
that
way.
there
was
no
reason
for
it
to
be
called.
these
particular
individuals
and
who
--
who
would
testify
the
same
thing
that
anthony
stracuzza
had
testified
to,
they
--
they
preferred
--
once
having
made
that
case
in
that
way
to
confirm
it
with
more
reliable
witnesses.
i
think
that
was
a
matter
of
trial
judgment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
the
accusation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that's
what
stated.
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
the
question
is
did
the
government
attorney
err
in
that
respect?
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
that's
what
i
mean.
when
i
say,
if
he
did
that
it
was
error.
if
he
made
the
--
if
the
made
the
issue
of
the
jury
his
own
integrity,
if
he
changed
it
so
that
there
was
only
one
way
to
find
them
not
guilty
and
that
was
to
find
him
guilty.
if
that's
the
effect
of
what
he
did,
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
was
error.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
--
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
it's
a
question
of
whether
he
was
--
putting
--
having
the
jury
to
determine
the
guilt
of
these
people
on
the
basis
of
his
own
guilt
or
innocence
which
marshalled
the
issue
before
the
jury
and
which
would
be
an
improper
basis.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
about
the
new
york
cases.
federal
cases
have
held
that
it's
improper
to
make
that
the
issue
before
the
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
when
there
is
--
when
there
is
an
accusation,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
that
testimony
had
been
bought
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
had
been
bought
that
the
government
had
made
a
deal
that
the
--
that
information
was
being
withheld
from
the
jury.
this
is
in
effect
a
denial,
i
mean,
it's
--
i
think,
it
is
proper
for
the
united
states
attorney
to
--
he
--
he
can't
ignore
it.
he
--
he
denies
it
and
tells
the
jury
--
if
he
doesn't
base
his
case
on
this
but
he
--
he
has
to
tell
the
jury
that
they
--
they
can't
convict
on
--
on
a
perjured
testimony.
if
they
believe
there's
been
perjured
testimony,
if
they
believe
that
--
why
they
--
they
should
get
an
upright?
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
in
so
many
words
but
all
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
set
a
deal
now
--
well,
he
--
his
last
--
his
last
statement
is
on
his
--
on
his
summation
of
30
pieces
of
silver,
i
think,
and
which
is
the
reference
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
to
do
anything
he
could.
so,
he'd
get
his
30
pieces
of
silver,
anything
he
could,
so
he
could
get
30
pieces
of
silver.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
--
i'm
surprised
myself
that
the
--
if
the
court
imposed
no
sentence
at
all
on
mr.
stracuzza,
he
--
he
did
--
the
--
the
only
service
in
the
other
case
and
in
this
case,
he
--
he
testified,
he
barely
sold
on
all
of
his
transactions
and
--
and
apparently,
the
trial
judge
felt
that
this
was
--
this
was
some
compensation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
this
particular
case,
i
may
say
that
i
don't
think
judge
murphy
needed
any
instructions
from
the
u.s.
attorney
as
to
what
mr.
stracuzza
has
done
in
this
case
because
it
was
perfectly
apparent
throughout
and
so
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
unless
there
is
some
indication
that
--
as
far
as
these
defendants,
as
far
as
these
petitioners
are
concerned,
unless
there's
some
indication
that
the
--
that
there
was
--
they
were
improperly
convicted,
there
was
something
wrong,
something
not
that
--
that
the
stracuzzas
got
too
good
a
deal,
not
that
they
shouldn't
have
gotten
an
--
and
this
the
evidence
that
the
stracuzzas
gave
and
that
anthony
stracuzza
gave
is
--
is
wrong
as
perjurious.
there's
no
reason
why
these
particular
defendants
could
gain
through
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
there
must
be
some
indication
that
there
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
improper
evidence
that
was
introduced.
now,
when
you
have
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that
--
that
issue
should
not
be
put
to
the
jury
and
if
that's
what
this
court
feels
must
put
to
the
jury,
why,
it
was
--
it
was
erroneous.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we
have
here
the
--
the
nolle
prossed
which
was
--
which
was
filed
and
the
statement
is
made
that
they
felt
they
couldn't
prove
that
she
knew
that
the
goods
were
stolen.
that's
what
the
united
states
attorney
says
in
the
nolle

that's
right.in
--
in
the
december
trial,
that's
when
it
took
place
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
had
--

(voice

--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
think
the
government
thought
anthony
stracuzza's
statement
that
his
wife
didn't
know
about
this.
this
was
a
husband
talking
about
his
wife's
guilt.
this
was
something
of
his
own.
we
didn't
--
the
--
the
united
states
attorney
wasn't
interested
in
proving
that
dorothy
stracuzza
didn't
know
about
it.
this
isn't
something
that
we
--
we
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
i
think
that
they
--
i
think
they
can
attack
and
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
when
the
man
lied
about
any
one
thing
that
it
could
be
held
against
him
for
anything
else
and
i
think
the
judge
was
quite
right
on
that.
and
that
if
the
jury
was
--
felt
that
anthony
stracuzza
perjured
himself
in
his
statements
about
his
wife's
knowledge
of
this
thing,
that
was
a
proper
thing
for
the
jury
to
consider.
but
i
do
not
think
--
i
do
not
think,
your
honor,
that
this
kept
into
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
attorney
was
buying
perjured
testimony.
the
united
states
attorney
didn't
want
--
didn't
have
any
desire
to
have
that
testimony.
i
will
attempt
to
get
the
copy
of
the
transcript
in
the
prior
sentencing
if
not
the
entire
case.
and
i
will
check
the
transcript
in
the
record
here
to
see
what
we
have,
one
with
respect
to
this
matter
and
also
with
respect
to
the
proceedings
at
the
time
that
the
sentences
were
suspended
for
the

this
is
