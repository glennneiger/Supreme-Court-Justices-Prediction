mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
question
in
here
is
whether
there
a
conspiracy
count
has
been
dismissed
by
the
trial
judge
on
the
ground
that
there
was
simply
no
evidence
to
have
sustained
in
the
first
place
whether
it's
proper
to
continue
the
joint
trial
and
to
submit
to
the
jury
the
remaining
substantive
counts
against
each
of
the
defendants
charging
each
defendant
who
are
the
petitioners
here
with
an
independent
and
unrelated
effects.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
am
sorry.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
stated
what
the
first
point
was.
i'll
restate
it.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i'll
just
restate
it.
the
first
question
is
this.
can
a
trial
against
three
defendants
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other,
unrelated
and
their
charge
was
three
similar
offenses
of
which
there's
no
joint
participation
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
correct,
who
only
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals
who
were
only
brought
to
trial
because
there
was
a
--
a
conspiracy
count
which
was
so
defective
that
when
the
government's
case
was
over,
the
trial
judge
said
there
is
no
evidence.
outwent
the
conspiracy
count.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
correct.
there
is
also
a
conspiracy
indictment
in
addition
but
for
the
sake
of
this
case
that
was
also
thrown
out
of
the
government's
evidence
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
it's
not
relevant
to
the
discussion
because
the
same
principle
applies.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
could
not
be
here
on
that
point.
we
have
another
point
involved.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no,
no.
i
--
i
might
feel
bad.
i
might
say
that
there
really
was
no
evidence
that
it
was
really
worthless
and
--
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
have
to
go
on
the
assumption
that
if
the
trial
judge
let
a
conspiracy
count
go
to
the
jury
that
at
least
it
was
a
prima
facie
case
and
the
people
may
well
of
guilty
of
conspiracy,
and
just
because
the
jury
acquitted,
i
couldn't
take
advantage
of
that.
in
--
in
other
words
--
the
mere
--
once
there's
enough
evidence
to
justify
original
joinder.
what
happens
in
the
jury
box
cannot
be
used
as
a
basis
to
come
before
this
court
and
say,
well,
the
jury
said
there
wasn't
conspiracy.
the
test
is
from
the
beginning,
is
there
--
but
when
it
goes
to
the
jury,
is
there
a
justification
for
having
three
separate
people
being
tried?
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
--
i
can't
quarrel
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
correct
--
that
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
only
when
at
--
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case,
the
court,
the
trial
court
on
its
own
motion,
on
its
own
motion
said
there's
no
evidence
of
a
conspiracy.
i
--
i
couldn't
stop
it.
in
other
words
the
(inaudible)
of
the
conspiracy
indictment
must
be
taken
for
granted.
i
couldn't
file
a
motion
to
dismiss.
there's
nothing
that
could
be
done
about
it.
that's
the
unfair
thing.
if
bracketing
individuals
with
a
conspiracy
count
that
is
meaningless
and
in
spite
of
the
warnings
of
course
that
the
court
has
from
at
least
10-15
years
has
warned
prosecutors
about
the
danger
of
the
widespread
conspiracy
indictments,
and
in
spite
of
a
great
deal
of
respectable
authority
that
it
isn't
fair
to
indict
an
individual
for
the
substantive
count
and
a
conspiracy
to
commit
the
substantive
count.
now,
the
posture
of
the
case
when
the
conspiracy
count
was
found
out
to
be
--
does
not
worth
the
paper
it
was
written
on,
is
that
you
have
three
respondents
who
didn't
know
each
other,
has
nothing
to
do
with
each
other,
and
yet
their
case
had
to
go
to
the
jury.
that
is
when
i
say
how
to
go
to
the
jury
as
the
trial
court
felt
that
because
he
could
admonish
in
cautionary
--
within
cautionary
instruction
for
the
jury
that
there
wouldn't
be
prejudice.
mr.
jacob
kossman
if
there
was
a
conspiracy
count,
there
was
a
--
and
there
is
this
disagreement
with
the
--
with
the
government.
i'll
--
i'll
put
it
this
way.
by
--
actually
since
there's
a
conflict
between
what
the
district
attorney
--
i
beg
your
pardon
--
with
--
with
what
the
solicitor
general
and
what
i
say
happened,
and
what
the
record
says
happened,
i'd
better
refer
to
the
actual
record.
now
on
page
12
(a)
of
the
record,
it's
an
extensive
record,
it
would
be
on
the
first
part
12
(a),
13
(a).
i
--
i
might
say
that
no
--
no
question
of
--
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
decided
this
case
on
the
merits.
no
question
was
ever
raised
by
the
district
attorney
before
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
there
was
a
motion
for
severance
or
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
government
and
their
brief
takes
the
position
that
we
were
arguing
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
and
we
did
not
ask
for
motion
for
severance.
and
then
in
fact
they
say
we
never
asked
for
a
motion
of
--
for
a
new
trial
even
where
it's
apparent
throughout
the
--
the
entire
record
that
we
asked
continually
for
motion
for
new
trial,
filed
a
motion
for
new
trial.
but
it
comes
to
--
on
page
12
(a).
the
court
on
12
(a),
that's
the
trial
court
said,
“well,
i
don't
think
you
may
come
anywhere
close
to
the
standard
that
you
have
to
prove
as
to
whether
there
were
three
separate
conspiracies
or
just
a
general
conspiracy.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
refer
back
again
to
page
11
(a).
now,
i
will
hear
the
motions
of
the
defendants
but
i
think
it
will
save
me
sometime
because
i
am
very
much
concerned
about
the
conspiracy
counts
if
i
hear
the
government
first
as
to
what
you
think
the
proof
is
on
both
conspiracy
counts.
well,
the
--
if
that
the
court
heard
the
government
first,
the
court
said,
“well,
i
assume
that
all
defendants
move
to
dismiss
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
am
reading
from
page
11
(a)
in
the
record.
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
jacob
kossman
at
the
bottom
page.
now,
i
will
hear
the
motions
of
the
defendants,
but
i
think
it
will
save
me
sometime
because
i
am
very
much
concerned
about
the
conspiracy
count.
if
i
hear
the
government
first
as
to
what
you
think
the
proof
is
on
both
conspiracy
counts.
well
i
admitted
what
the
government
stated
and
then
the
court.
well,
i
assume
that
all
defendants
move
to
dismiss
all
of
the
various
counts
in
both
indictments
at
least
for
the
first
motion
and
court
grants
the
motion
with
regard
to
both
conspiracy
counts.
then
mr.
marren
(ph)
who
was
the
district
attorney
asked
may
i
--
asked
that
the
court
whether
dismissal
was
based
on
if
they
had
approved
a
single
conspiracy
because
of
the
variance
and
the
court
replied.
well,
i
don't
think
you
may
come
anywhere
near
close
to
the
standard
that
you
have
to
prove.
now,
on
12
(a)
the
--
the
court
was
concerned
about
the
aggregate
value.
now
jumping
to
13
(a),
mr.
steinberg
in
the
middle
of
13
(a)
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
the
other
point,
yes.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
the
group,
the
aggregating
of
whether
$5,000
can
be
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
so,
mr.
steinberg
said,
he
was
the
trial
counsel
there
for
two
of
the
--
one
of
the
defendants.
if
your
honor
please,
you
have
deprived
yourself
of
hearing
a
great
argument
on
motion.
before
we
get
to
those
points,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
huge
mass
of
evidence
which
has
been
admitted
here
subject
to
connection
on
the
conspiracies
which
your
honor
has
dismissed
and
your
honor
is
familiar
with
the
canella
case.
in
the
brief,
i
stated
the
canella
case
which
is
157
f.2d,
which
concerns
itself
with
the
motion
for
new
trial
due
to
prejudicial
evidence,
kotteakos
case,
and
i
suppose
that
was
a
shorthand
method
of
referring
to
the
court
to
the
point
that
--
that
he
met
--
he
kept
to
unmake
it.
the
court
said,
yes,
but
the
mess
can
be
very
easily
segregated
and
so
the
conversation
is
about
--
about
segregation
on
page
14
(a).
it's
not
just
one
sentence.
now,
the
entire
page
without
taking
the
time
of
the
court
to
read
it,
aside
from
that
there's
evidence
here.
and
jumping
to
the
fourth
paragraph,
now,
if
there
were
no
conspiracy
indictment
on
this
case
that
or
from
the
beginning,
and
the
district
attorney
has
to
take
that
chance.
that
it
was
this
calculated
risk.
he
wants
to
--
he
wants
to
proceed
on
a
conspiracy
indictment
knowing
the
risk
of
showing
an
indiscriminate
evidence
hoping
it
will
be
connected
later
but
not
having
succeeded
in
doing
that.
he
took
that
calculated
risk
that
a
great
deal
would
go
in
which
might
prejudice,
one
man
and
another
man.
skipping
now
since
he
failed
the
conspiracy
test
he's
now
in
the
position
of
having
put
that
evidence
then.
and
i
seriously
feel
your
honor
that
there's
a
very
great
doubt
that
no
matter
what
instructions
your
honor
conscientiously
gives,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
erase
that.
the
court
says,
“i
don't
think
so.”
now,
i
suggest
that
under
those
circumstances
that
the
--
that's
the
equivalent
of
saying,
we
want
a
new
trial;
we
want
a
motion
for
severance.
however,
even
the
government,
there
should
be
severance
at
that
point.
however
the
government
doesn't
make
an
issue
of
that
the
way
i
have
and
this,
impatiently
say,
that
this
wasn't
arguing
on
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
we're
strict
speaking
of
--
it
--
it
isn't
team
in
the
new
informal
manner
during
the
course
of
the
court
having
decided
to
fill
out
the
conspiracy
counts.
they
said
--
and
they
wouldn't
hear
about
the
argument
of
substantive
count.
at
any
rate
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
no
issue
was
ever
made
by
the
government
either
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
considered
this
point
on
the
merits.
and
no
issue
was
ever
made
on
--
on
the
brief,
on
the
merits
in
this
particular
point.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
i
believe
your
honor
on
page
--
going
to
page
64
(a)
on
the
same
appendix,
of
course
the
printer
here
printed
the
appendix
and
then
64
(a)
at
the
bottom
part,
64
(a).
at
the
bottom
part
mr.
steinberg
entered
in
the
record
if
your
honor
please,
we
would
like
to
renew
our
motion
for
an
acquittal
at
the
present
time
and
also
for
a
new
trial
on
behalf
of
all
defendants
in
the
court
for
a
new
trial
based
upon
the
same
reasonings.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes
sir
and
the
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
the
problem
on
the
merits
and
the
question
as
to
who
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
on
the
merits
of
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
but,
no.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
put
it
at
this
way.
they
said,
“were
it
not
for
the
conspiracy
count,
this
prosecution
could
never
have
started
but
there
is
still
--
that
there
was
no
prejudice
in
the
case
because
of
the
courts
have
been
struck
since
50
times.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
--
that
is
correct
and
--
and
that
i
find
myself
with
those
exact
words.
that
is
correct
but
my
quote
is
reading
that
page
and
there
two
pages
without
using
the
magic
word
“severance”,
it
simply
said
“it's
unfair
to
go
ahead”
and
they
quoted
the
case
which
was
--
in
other
words
we
were
conscious.
it's
not
an
afterthought.
we
were
conscious
of
the
problem
at
that
particular
moment
and
the
court
said
“no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
though
i
can
proceed
without
any
prejudice.”
and
he
warned
the
jury
that
the
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
then,
of
course
the
court
of
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
now,
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
treat
this
problem?
the
court
of
appeals
stated
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
conspiracy,
you
couldn't
have
had
the
joinder.
but
we
don't
feel,
as
quoting
the
court
of
appeals,
we
don't
feel
that
the
defendants
were
prejudiced
and
the
reason
why
is
this.
they
said,
the
trial
judge
gave
over
50
cautionary
instructions.
now
we
submit
that
itself
is
almost
--
there's
a
right
paradox
in
almost
stating
that
50
instructions
were
necessary
in
order
to
keep
the
evidence
separated
between
the
--
there
are
really
four
defendants
but
treating
the
petitioners
in
this
case
as
one
or
two,
the
three
sets
of
defendants.
number
two,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
the
evidence
in
this
case,
which
dramatizes
though
the
lack
of
a
reason
why
there
ever
should
have
been
conspiracy
count
put
on
here
was
--
was
easily
separated.
there
was
no
evidence
involving
a
which
involved
b
or
involved
c,
all
separate
and
distinct,
and
therefore,
less
likelihood
for
confusion.
now,
we
take
the
position
that
the
jurors
cannot
carry
two
sets
of
mental
books
and
they
cannot
keep
in
their
head
what's
admissible
only
if
the
conspiracy
is
finally
printed
and
what
is
inadmissible
because
no
conspiracy
was
printed.
the
court
said,
now
you
keep
the
evidence
about
one,
so
that's
one.
the
court
--
the
trial
court
did
everything
that
was
possible
under
the
circumstances.
they
tried
request
the
jury
not
to
mix
up
the
evidence
about
what
one
person
said
about
the
other.
we
say
two
things.
one,
we
had
no
business
being
tried
because
even
if
there
was
no
prejudice
you
just
can't
try
three
people
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
each
other.
mr.
jacob
kossman
even
if
there
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
--
i
say
it's
–
it
--
it
goes
--
even
conceding
that
there
would
be
no
prejudice.
if
we
had
12
--
12
people
who
won
the
--
the
$64,000
question.
the
smartest
individuals
in
the
world
but
we
had
12
ibm
machines
in
there.
you
just
can't
try
under
our
system
of
government,
three
people
or
30
people
together.
mr.
jacob
kossman
why
not?
because
they
don't
get
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
because
under
our
system
of
government
we
believe
that
each
individual
is
to
be
judge
for
what
he
himself
does
and
he
should
not
be
put
in
an
atmosphere
of
guilt
as
a
result
of
what
some
other
people
have
done.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no,
well,
you
can't
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
but
--
i
--
i
think
it's
concrete
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
the
reason
why
it's
concrete
is
that
law
--
our
rule
8
(a),
rule
8
(b)
does
--
doesn't
permit
that
if
you
--
if
i
will
go
to
statutory
basis.
in
other
words,
rule
8
(b)
which
--
which
recognizes
the
fundamental
right
of
a
man
to
be
left
alone
and
not
only
to
be
left
alone
but
what's
more
important
to
be
tried
alone
rule
8
(b)
puts
it
this
way.
two
or
more
defendants
may
be
charged
in
the
same
indictment
or
information
if
they
are
alleged
to
have
participated
in
the
same
act
or
transactions
or
in
the
same
series
of
acts
or
transactions
constituting
the
offense
or
offenses.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
correct.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeal
said.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct.
and
it's
one
of
those
things
of
course
that
you
could
never
raise
before
the
particular
trial.
now,
why
should
the
government
on
--
if
there
were
no
legal
reason,
why
should
the
government
on
moral
grounds
have
the
windfall
of
inadmissible
evidence
of
one
person
against
another?
to
give
an
example,
there
were
only
1600
pages
of
testimony
that
tried
for
17
days,
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
we
had
this
supplier,
main
government
witness.
he
stated
that
this
one
defendant,
karp,
told
him
in
the
conversation,
he
says,
“i
am
worried.
do
you
have
protection?”
well,
what
change
did
the
--
the
two
other
defendants
have
with
--
with
that
statement?
another
defendant
had
witnesses
from
his
store.
these
people
were
three
small
storekeepers
who
were
buying
merchandise,
one
in
west
virginia
and
one
in
massachusetts
and
one
in
lebanon,
pennsylvania.
one
person
said
the
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
lebanon,
pennsylvania.
mr.
jacob
kossman
in
new
york
city,
because
they
came
to
the
supplier
in
new
york
city
and
they
worked
out
of
indictment
that
they
caused
to
be
transported.
now,
one
of
the
defendant's
employee
said
that
--
he
said,
“i
can
sell
this
dresses
cheaper
because
they're
stolen.”
now
our
defendant,
petitioner
here,
when
he
was
in
the
store
--
by
the
way
this
was
a
public
store.
it
wasn't
they've
--
you
paid
by
check.
it
wasn't
a
secrete
proposition
involved
the
--
the
question
that
the
defendants
based
their
hopes
of
freedom
with
the
jury
was
that
there
was
no
--
they
have
no
knowledge
that
this
was
stolen
merchandise.
now,
the
defendant
when
he
was
found
in
the
place
by
the
agents,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
agents,
he
said,
and
it
wasn't
true,
but
people
do
say
these
things.
it's
the
first
time
i've
even
been
here.
now,
i've
certainly
been
dealt
with
for
the
other
two
people,
and
especially
in
order
to
dramatize
the
fact
that
he
was
there,
they
darkened
the
court
room
and
showed
moving
pictures
to
prove
that
he
was
there.
now,
i
am
now
taking
into
the
specific
elements
of
--
of
actual
prejudice,
but
this
court
--
this
court
can't
possibly
deal
with
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases
that
take
place
where
you
have
to
show
actual
prejudice.
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
in
the
grunewald
case
warned
prosecutors
to
be
careful
of
this
wide
sweeping
conspiracy
charges.
now
of
course
where
people
conspire
together,
they
have
to
take
the
risk
of
being
tried
together.
it's
true.
they
may
suffer
but
that
is
part
of
the
--
there's
nothing
can
be
done
about
it.
they'd
have
to
polish
there
the
trauma
of
conspiracy.
sure,
you
can
go
on
rule
14
and
give
mighty
reasons
as
to
why
there
should
be
a
severance.
but
when
people
who
don't
conspire
together,
when
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other,
they
should
have
to
sit
together,
they
should
have
to
be
--
present
their
three
different
defenses
together
to
the
same
jury,
so
it
--
that
--
that's
basic
and
that's
fundamental
to
bring
you
from
new
york
to
washington.
suppose
three
people
went
to
a
liquor
store
in
washington,
each
one
bought
liquor.
it
turns
out
that
the
liquor
is
stolen.
it
has
been
hijacked.
should
those
three
people
be
tried?
should
30
people
be
tried?
if
they
go
and
visit
some
gambling
place
and
--
and
there's
raid?
should
they
be
tried
for
conspiracy?
the
question
of
substantive
offense
is
a
different
proposition
involved
where
the
evidence
is
so
clear.
now,
the
strange
thing
about
this
case
is
--
is
that
the
government,
the
government
on
the
one
hand,
argues
here.
they
didn't
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
there's
been
a
shift
in
position.
they
now
claim,
the
government,
that
court
of
appeals
was
wrong.
and
i
have
an
unexpected
ally
in
--
in
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion.
they
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
was
wrong
in
saying
that
without
the
conspiracy,
you
couldn't
try
the
case.
and
they've
worked
out
a
theory
that
this
is
really
a
joint
proposition
involved.
and
they
have
quoted
30
cases
which
to
my
mind
is
true,
that
prove
our
point
because
in
the
cases
they
--
they
cite
i
mean
it's
--
well
take
one,
they
cite
h.j.k.
theatre
as
an
analogous
circumstance,
236
f.2d
case,
a
second
circuit
case.
that's
what
they
cite
as
--
as
analogous
to
this.
what
happened
in
that
case?
the
--
the
appellants
were
indicted
in
nine
indictments,
and
so
--
and
rosenblum
and
one
of
the
corporate
defendants
were
charged
with
willful
attempts
to
be
paid
--
and
evade
taxes.
joint
returns
were
filed.
there
was
a
community
of
interest.
they
were
together.
in
those
cases
when
people
come
under
rule
14
and
say,
“we
wish
to
have
a
severance,”
that's
the
discretionary
proposition
for
this
illegal
proposition.
you
certainly
cannot
compare
this
case
and
the
30
or
40
other
cases
that
they've
cited.
now,
the
strange
thing
is
this.
that
of
all
the
cases
that
the
government
cited,
for
some
special
reason,
maybe
perhaps
it
was
an
oversight,
they
did
not
cite
the
case
of
ingram
versus
united
states,
272
f.2d
which
was
in
the
reply
brief
that
i
filed
on
tuesday.
i
only
received
the
government's
brief
last
tuesday.
272
f.2d
567,
they
did
cite
a
later
case
272
f.2d
800
for
a
point
which
--
when
you
read
that
case,
it
proves
our
point.
there
was
a
joinder
there,
people
--
community
of
interest,
people
involved.
now,
in
the
ingram
case
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
judge
sobeloff's
opinion.
now,
judge
sobeloff
quoted
i
--
well,
i
have
this
--
i
--
i
can
only
deteriorate
by
trying
to
--
by
trying
to
quote
indirectly
so
i
better
quote
directly
what
judge
sobeloff
stated
there.
“rule
8
(b)
specifically
states
when
it
is
permissible
to
join
defendants
in
a
single
indictment
and
trial.
it
provides
that
two
or
more
defendants
may,
italicized,
be
jointly
charged
if
they
are
alleged
to
have
participated
in
the
same
act
or
transaction.
the
necessary
inference
from
this
is
that
they
may
not
be
jointly
indicted
or
tried
in
the
absence
of
a
common
act
or
transaction.”
now
rule
14
confers
upon
the
trial
judge's
discretion
to
relieve
from
prejudicial
joinder.
several
defendants
may
have
been
involved
in
the
same
act
or
transaction
but
for
some
reason,
one
of
them
may
be
prejudiced
and
they
appeal
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
it's
to
avoid
injustice
in
such
situation
that
rule
14
vests
the
trial
judge
with
wide
discretion,
but
the
joinder
of
defendants
and
offenses
totally
unconnected
is
prohibited
by
rule
8
(b).
it's
not
a
matter
of
discretion.
now
certainly,
that
--
that
speaks
for
itself
and
rule
13
which
provides
for
the
consolidation
of
indictments
assumes,
assumes
that
it
could
have
originally
been
placed
in
one
indictment.
well,
that's
so
much
for
the
--
the
--
for
the
--
the
first
point.
it's
fundamental.
it's
basic.
and
--
and
since
the
government
is
now
defending
this
on
its
merits,
what
might
take
place
if
such
a
--
a
procedural
gimmick
is
permitted
is
not
too
hard
to
visualize.
now
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
good
faith
or
bad
faith.
the
government
states
that
i
don't
--
i
don't
prove
bad
faith
even
the
court
below
said
i
--
i
don't
prove
bad
faith
and
i
don't
say
it
wasn't
bad
faith,
but
i
say
it
just
as
an
individual
may
be
the
subject
of
an
illegal
search,
an
illegal
arrest
that
getting
the
--
an
illegal
detention.
the
government
has
to
have
a
--
a
high
moral
standard
when
it
comes
to
--
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
they
can't
use
evidence
that
they
get
in
a
bad
way
and
say
“i
beg
your
pardon,
we
didn't
mean
to
do
it
in
a
bad
way.”
well,
now
the
second
point
is
--
it
really
was
my
third
point,
but
because
the
government
switched
again
in
this
case,
it
now
becomes
the
second
point.
now
at
the
trial
--
at
the
trial
level,
the
proposition
was
put
forth
by
the
government
and
accepted
by
the
trial
judge
that
you
can
add
separate
and
distinct
transactions
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
$5,000
valuation.
the
trial
judge
asked
the
district
attorney
to
prepare
a
charge
based
on
that
and
a
charge
was
so
given.
we
ask
that
the
case
be
submitted
to
the
jury
on
this
point
only
if
there
could
be
--
if
they
would
be
aggregated
according
specifically
the
to
andrew's
case.
that
was
refused.
now,
at
the
court
of
appeal
level,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
the
issue
of
separate
and
distinct.
they
said
it
is
not
necessary
because
here
we
have
a
unity
of
purpose.
here,
we
have
an
agreement,
which
we
deny
there
is,
but
therefore
it's
not
necessary
to
decide.
now
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
--
and
as
matter
of
fact
the
petition
for
rehearing,
we
called
attention
of
the
court
to
the
grunewald
point,
namely
that
you
cannot
convict
an
individual
on
a
theory
first
put
forth
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
here,
it
was
particularly
aggravating,
because
here,
they're
convicting
us
on
a
theory
that
we
had
asked
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
which
was
refused.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
“we
don't
have
to
decide
the
other
point.
this
is
good
enough.”
so
we
say
that
under
the
grunewald
thing,
there
was
no
problem
in
that.
and
i
--
and
the
government
knows
that
because
when
they
came
here
on
the
brief
that
they
filed
here
on
the
merits,
they
now
say
they're
not
satisfied
by
saying
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
the
first
time;
they
now
say
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
the
second
time.
it's
the
trial
court
that's
right.
they
now
say
that
separate
transactions
can
be
--
and
this
thing
can
be
aggregated
and
--
and
submitted
to
the
jury,
therefore,
bypassing
the
grunewald
point,
because
if
that
is
correct
--
in
other
words,
if
you
can
charge
a
person
in
an
indictment,
add
up
$5,000
on
a
separate
and
distinct
transactions,
then
grunewald
doesn't
apply,
because
the
government
has
a
right
to
come
here
and
they
certainly
have
tried
and
--
and
put
forth
every
possible
reason
to
sustain
the
verdict
but
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct,
each
count.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
right.
it
was
horizontal,
not
vertical.
now,
the
question
is
whether
--
whether
that
is
permissible.
well,
the
legislative
history
is
not
as
clear
as
it
should
be
and
there's
that
old
saying
that
when
the
legislative
history
is
not
too
clear,
one
should
look
at
the
statute.
and
looking
at
the
statute
as
i
read
it,
and
i
must
confess
every
time
i
read
it
and
reread
it
and
reread
it,
i
--
i
feel
there's
possibilities
of
other
meanings
none
--
none
of
which
fits
in
with
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
which
is
utterly
farfetched
and
against
our
whole
common
law
background
of
criminal
law,
against
the
decision
in
the
andrew's
case
which
congress
was
conscious
of
when
they
reenacted
the
statute
and
that
--
and
they
cite
no
authority
for
it.
they
say
it
and
saying
it
the
--
they
live
and
go
with
that.
now,
what
does
the
act
--
how
does
the
act
read?
the
actual
statute
reads
as
follows.
“whoever
transports
2314
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
any
goods
where
merchandise,
securities,
or
money
of
the
value
of
5,000
or
more.”
now,
it
doesn't
read,
whoever
transports
in
one
or
more
shipments,
goods
of
$5,000.
the
whole
concept
of
criminal
law
is
one
act,
one
crime,
two
acts,
two
crimes.
the
only
--
the
only
variation
of
that
principle
is
that
its
found
according
to
a
conspiracy
or
single
plan.
as
a
matter
as
fact,
if
there's
a
conspiracy
to
transport
goods
of
more
than
$5,000
that
doesn't
even
have
to
be
a
single
shipment.
value
has
no
place
in
the
--
in
the
conspiracy
angle
just
a
mere
conspiracy
plus
an
overt
act.
now,
if
there
hadn't
been
the
andrew's
case,
if
there
hadn't
been
the
discussion
of
the
legislative
history,
if
we
were
going
according
to
the
english
system,
whoever
transports
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
goods
of
the
value
of
$5,000,
i
would
say
that
it
refers
to
one
transportation.
yes
there's
a
definition
of
value.
value
means
the
aggregate
value
of
all
goods,
but
some
--
in
the
particular
indictment.
but
to
me,
that
takes
care
of
the
situation
in
case
an
individual
takes
various
items
in
the
same
truckload.
in
other
words
if
someone
steals
stuff
from
a
--
let's
say
a
ladies
dress
shop
comes
forward
with
the
fur
coat,
feels
the
fur
coat
is
incomplete
by
itself
and
takes
shoes,
handbags,
jewelry,
he
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
say
each
item
--
each
item
is
less
than
5,000.
that's
what
--
if
there
was
no
legislative
history,
i
would
take
that
as
the
--
as
the
--
the
logical
reading
whoever
transports
goods
in
the
value
of
$5,000
because
the
concept
of
retroactive
criminal
liability,
the
concept
that
you
can
take
$10
now
and
a
$1,000
now,
in
two
years,
another
$1,000
and
a
year
of
$1,000
and
does
not
necessary
even
come
to
same
owner
and
that
--
that
just
doesn't
make
sense,
bearing
in
mind
that's
a
criminal
statute.
bearing
in
mind
that
this
is
not
only
a
criminal
statute
but
that
it's
the
type
of
criminal
statute
which
isn't
so
necessary
to
protect
our
--
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
responsibilities,
because
this
is
a
supplement
to
the
states.
each
one
of
these
individual
if
they
do
something
wrong
can
be
punished
by
the
state.
this
is
not
the
type
of
conspiracy
where
they're
stealing
from
the
trains
or
where
they're
stealing
from
the
--
from
the
platforms.
we
have
--
we
have
a
history
where
justice
holmes
in
analyzing
the
motor
vehicle
act
stated
that
in
his
opinion,
an
airplane
was
not
a
--
a
motor
vehicle,
and
therefore,
one
could
not
be
charged.
so,
the
--
the
entire
concept
looking
at
the
statute
itself.
now
going
back
to
the
legislative
history,
what
do
we
find
through
these
expressions?
in
the
event
that
a
defendant
is
charged
in
the
same
indictment
with
two
or
more
violations
of
this
act,
then
the
aggregate
value
of
all
goods
shall
constitute
the
value
thereof.
now,
i
don't
understand
it,
because
two
or
more
violations,
how
can
it
be
a
violation
unless
it's
5,000?
so
if
we're
going
to
adopt
the
--
the
well
known
usage
of
congressional
english
and
say
by
violations
they
mean
infractions,
then
i
can
reconcile
it,
but
looking
at
it
literally,
two
or
more
violations,
they
don't
have
to
aggregate
to
get
the
$5,000.
now,
it
may
well
be
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
am
referring
to
--
on
page
41
of
my
brief
--
the
brief
where
i
am
quoting
--
where
i
am
quoting
the
--
the
--
about
the
legislative
histories.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
see
i
have
the
appendix.
i
have
the
entire
histories
back
there
confining
myself
--
perhaps,
i
should
skip
from
there
to
(a)
11
where
i
actually
have
the
exact
words
of
the
--
of
the
people
preparing
the
managers,
preparing
the
--
that's
(a)
11.
section
5
of
the
present
act
provides
that
in
the
event
--
in
the
event
the
defendant
was
charged
with
two
or
more
violations
the
aggregated
value
of
the
property.
now
the
word
“violations”
can't
mean
what
it
normally
means
under
those
circumstances
because
one
violation
is
good
enough
without
the
aggregation.
now
therefore
it
may
well
be
that
it
means
infractions.
it
may
also
well
mean
that
there
were
several
sections
under
the
act
that
required
no
moneys
like
stealing,
transporting
dyes
or
receiving
with
a
value
of
$500.
is
it
possible
that
it
meant
those
particular
sections?
well,
in
view
of
the
legislative
history,
i
--
i
couldn't
take
that
meaning.
i
took
the
meaning
that
based
on
other
things
stated
in
--
in
the
history
namely,
(a)
16.
let's
say
i'll
go
to
--
not
so
much
of
(a)
16.
there's
another
section
here
that
they
changed
the
language.
they
now
refer
to
“if
a
person
is
charged
with
a
series
of
violations,
then
you
can
aggregate
a
series
of
transactions.”
now
under
those
circumstances,
i
took
the
meaning
and
i
had
it
ready
made
for
me
that
that
judge
parker
did
in
the
andrew's
case.
he
said,
“where
there's
unity
of
purpose,
where
there's
a
conspiracy,
where
there's
a
plan,
you
can
add
up.”
and
that's
been
the
law
in
all
our
states.
i
quoted
two
cases,
one
from
california,
one
from
new
york.
i
quoted
the
alr
in
the
reply
brief
which
adds
up
thousands
of
cases
and
the
whole
philosophy
has
been
in
charging
people
with
grand
larceny.
you
can
only
charge
him
with
grand
larceny
if
you
add
up
the
little
larcenies
but
only
--
only
if
there's
a
--
if
it's
done
pursuant
to
a
plan.
now
otherwise,
without
the
plan,
you
--
you
cannot
add
up.
so
this
statute
makes
sense,
punishes
bad
people
who
conspire
to
transport
across
the
line
goods
in
amount
of
more
--
5,000
or
more
even
without
them
transporting
$1,
takes
care
of
statute
of
limitations
which
otherwise
would
be
very
a
difficult
proposition.
in
other
words,
suppose
someone
in
the
first
four
years
to
$4,000
worth
of
stuff,
stolen
stuff.
the
sixth
year,
the
seventh
year,
he
takes
$2,000
is
there
a
crime
committed?
this
business
of
retroactively
saying
that
these
things
that
you
did
in
the
past
are
criminal
because
of
what
you
did
three,
four,
five
years
later.
that's
not
part
of
our
philosophy
and
we
have
to
assume
that
congress
in
passing
this
particular
section,
this
particular
statute,
which
was
bitterly
contested.
i
mean,
they
turned
down
500,
they
turned
down
1,500,
they
turned
2,500
and
they
made
it
$5,000
a
minimum,
so
it
means
exactly
what
it
says.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well
the
value
section
means
--
that
--
the
--
the
value
section
refers,
2211
refers
to
the
prior
history.
they
say
that
you
cannot
read
2211
in
the
present
code
without
going
back
to
the
history,
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
history,
then
--
then
you
were
dealing
with
the
series
of
violations,
series
of
transactions
which
--
which
the
legislative
history
talks
about.
now,
it
can
be
aggregated
value
just
in
the
indictment
because
you
can
have
an
indictment
with
ten
different
counts
and
each
count
was
spelled
over
a
long
period
of
time
then
the
--
there
would
be
the
--
those
problems
of
statutory
limitations
involved
as
well
as
retroactivity
involved.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
agrees
that
there
must
be
unity
of
purpose.
there
must
be
an
agreement,
the
government
has
not
got
--
has
not
come
forth
with
one
case.
they
simply
say
so
but
where
is
one
case
to
prove
their
point?
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
decided
and
which
we
disagree
and
whether
we're
right
or
wrong
is
unimportant
because
every
case
states
that
in
that
area
of
disagreement
as
to
whether
there
is
or
there
is
not
a
--
an
agreement
that
it
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
but
the
court
of
appeals
says
we
don't
have
to
decide
(inaudible)
because
here,
there
was
an
agreement.
precisely,
the
question
that
we
have
submitted
to
the
--
asked
the
trail
court
to
submit
to
the
jury,
is
there
or
is
there
not
an
agreement.
now,
of
course,
the
government
states
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
that
it
isn't
necessary
to
have
an
agreement.
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
felt
the
necessity
of
--
of
that
there
is
an
agreement.
now
why
do
we
say
there's
no
agreement?
i
don't
want
to
run
away
from
the
merits
of
the
situation
aside
from
the
grunewald
thing,
because
here
the
evidence
conclusively
shows
that
there
was
no
agreement.
how
were
--
how
were
the
--
how
were
the
goods
purchased?
the
individual
came
into
the
place
and
selected
it.
there
was
no
agreement.
there
was
an
agreement.
it's
a
play
on
words.
there
was
an
agreement
on
amount
of
discount,
how
it
would
be
transported.
but
suppose
i
will
go
into
a
discount
store
here
in
washington
and
i
say
“how
much
will
you
charge
me
if
i
buy
this
so
much?
how
will
you
ship
it?”
details
of
a
contemplated
transaction
is
not
an
agreement
to
purchase
and
that's
submitted
even
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
they
took
--
they
contemplated
and
no
special
amount
was
involved.
now
actually
what
were
the
mechanics
of
buying
the
things?
well,
here
is
the
way
it
happened
in
the
prior
occasion.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
am
now
in
page
40
on
the
record.
mr.
jacob
kossman
40
without
the
(a).
mr.
jacob
kossman
this
is
the
government's
permission.
mr.
jacob
kossman
by
the
way,
the
government
seems
to
be
so
afraid
of
the
grunewald
point
that
they
don't
even
print
it
in
there
appendix.
now
maybe
it's
the
printer's
mistake
or
maybe
it's
proves
the
point
that
they
say
that
you
like
to
forget
what
hurts
you.
on
page
40,
well,
they
would
look
at
that
merchandise
that
is
displayed
on
hand
there
and
berk
would
show
the
invoices
describing
this
merchandise.
if
they
wanted
it,
it
would
go
right
out,
now
that
refers
to
prior
transactions
before
this
particular
individual.
how
did
our
person's
--
schaffers
buy
stuff?
by
selection.
stuff
was
even
returned
so
there
was
no
standing
agreement
and
to
cap
the
climax
with
this
--
which
were
--
it's
--
it's
so
unusual
i
will
let
the
record
to
speak
for
itself,
but
to
cap
the
climax,
what
does
the
government
finally
say,
what
does
the
government
say
about
this
business
of
you
can
add
up
separate
and
distinct.
they
say
--
they
say
here,
there
was
a
prearranged
agreement
which
contemplated
--
i
am
reading
from
the
government's
brief
on
page
50
which
contemplated
continuous
shipments
at
specified
discounts,
at
specified
types
of
goods.
we
read
the
reference
to
this
fact
referring
to
the
court
of
appeals
fact
that
they
found
that
there
was
an
agreement
in
the
opinion
below,
as
merely
spelling
out
that
closeness
of
relationship.
now,
i
don't
know
the
difference
between
the
spelling
out
and
the
finding
as
a
fact.
the
court
of
appeals
spelled
it
out.
they
found
it
as
a
fact.
it
wasn't
necessary
under
that
statement
to
therefore
consider
the
proposition
whether
it
was
separate
and
distinct.
by
finding
as
a
fact,
they
deprived
us
of
a
jury
right,
to
have
the
jury
pass
on
that,
and
that
is
just
one
more
instance
of
what
we
truly
can
say
is
we
did
not
a
get
a
fair
trial
in
this
court.
mr.
jacob
kossman
page
110.
mr.
jacob
kossman
page
110.
mr.
jacob
kossman
we
need
not
--
not
the
--
we
need
not
now
decide
what
ruling
should
be
made
in
the
case
where
the
transactions
are
truly,
“separate
and
distinct.”
much
may
depend
upon
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
here
however,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
shipments
with
respect
to
each
appellant
were
not
“separate
and
distinct.”
although
the
overall
conspiracy
between
the
mr.
(inaudible)
and
the
four
appellants
was
not
established.
the
proofs
disclosed
that
each
appellant
as
efficient
“unity
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute.”
and
that
--
before
i
forget,
that
of
course
is
what
the
government
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
--
and
i
quoted
the
excerpts
from
the
brief.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
switch
there
too,
that
the
district
attorney
who
tried
the
case
on
the
--
on
the
separate
and
distinct
upon
reflection,
very
honestly
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
adopted
his
reasoning
that
there
has
to
be
a
claim,
not
conscious
of
the
fact
at
that
moment
that
perhaps
it
has
been
more
forceful
in
bringing
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
but
we
did
what
we
could,
but
it
had
never
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
all
goods
--
and
they're
in
--
now
that
is
--
that
--
that
paragraph
110
(a)
is
“spelling
out”
by
--
by
the
government
today
and
not
fact
finding.
and
we
submit
tha,
in
essence,
they've
done
not
only
the
defendants
an
injustice,
they've
done
the
court
of
appeals
an
injustice,
they've
done
the
administration
of
criminal
law
an
injustice
by
presenting
the
same
arguments
under
different
labels
and
yet
not
exposing
the
weakness
of
the
original
argument.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no
because
it
was
during
the
trial.
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh
that
there's
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon
--
i
beg
your
--
the
original
motion
of
severance
was
made
by
one
party
but
not
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
a
misjoinder
of
party
or
a
misjoinder
of
offense.
he
sought
relief
solely
on
the
ground
that
because
one
of
the
defendants
had
a
criminal
record,
he
didn't
want
to
be
part
of
that.
but
that
was
in
writing.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
jacob
kossman
what
--
what
is
in
the
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
what
is
in
the
record
--
what
is
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
the
documented
is
not
printed
but
the
affidavit
of
the
district
attorney
opposing
the
severance
is
printed
on
--
in
the
record
here
just
before
the
--
just
before
the
court's
opinion
and
that
is
printed
out.
to
add
insult
a
injury,
that's
on
page
103.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
has
been
filed.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
has
been
filed.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
is
here.
mr.
jacob
kossman
now
on
page
103
--
of
course
that
was
before
the
case
started.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
on
page
103,
affidavit
in
our
position,
motion
for
severance.
it
was
only
filed
by
one
person,
the
defendant
karp.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon.
how
could
he,
after
all
the
conspiracy
count
charged
that
they
conspired
in
diverse
different
ways.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
good
enough.
their
affirmance
of
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
this
--
this
was
no
open
and
shut
case.
the
charge
of
the
court
on
page
55
(a)
states
--
55
(a),
the
front
part
of
the
book,
“you
will
recall
that
stracuzza
testified
that
he
did
not
tell
any
of
defendants
that
the
goods
were
stolen,
although
he
testified
that
all
the
goods
he
sold
were
in
fact
stolen?”
the
government
claims
that
the
circumstantial
evidence
from
which
you
properly
draw
the
inference
against
each
defendant,
is
the
sum
total
of
a
number
of
different
facts
and
circumstances.
and
referring
to
the
transcript,
which
is
not
printed,
is
578,
the
question
was
asked
of
stracuzza,
“did
you
tell
any
of
your
customers
that
the
goods
were
stolen?”
the
answer
was,
no.
and
stracuzza
had
eight
or
nine
other
customers
which
are
in
the
record.
that's
point
number
one.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
right.
he
was
the
main
government
witness.
he
was
the
supplier
and
he
said,
i
didn't
tell
anybody
that
the
goods
were
stolen.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jacob
kossman
it's
--
that
is
correct,
when
the
judge
states,
for
example,
as
against
all
the
invoices.
it
says
that
the
manufacture
invoices
which
stracuzza
says
were
--
were
an
obvious
indication
that
the
goods
were
stolen,
but
there
are
many
not
to
argue
the
case
on
the
merits
and
we
didn't
because
of
the
jury's
verdict,
but
since
it's
been
introduced,
but
there
are
many
--
many
discount
houses
all
over
the
country,
where
they
have
original
manufacture's
invoices
and
they
show
it
to
people.
but
this
was
a
circumstantial
evidence
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeal
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
the
word,
“it”
i
think
refers
to
the
--
the
government.
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
exactly
the
court
expressing
his
own
opinion,
as
such,
for
example,
as
against
all
the
defendant,
it
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
says.
i
mean
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
now,
secondly
on
page
114
of
the
court
of
appeals-based
opinion
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
page
114.
the
first
--
the
first
paragraph
--
page
114,
“each
defendant
live
in
a
different
part
of
the
east,
except
to
the
two
schaffers,
who
operated
the
store
together.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
anyone
of
them
knew
that
stracuzzas
dealings
with
the
others.”
now,
this
--
there
was
that
loose
testimony
they
asked
the
--
in
a
statement
one
of
the
other
defendants.
“did
you
know
the
schaffer?”
and
he
said,
“i
was
introduced
to
him
years
ago.”
that's
all
there
was
to
then.
mere
--
i
was
introduced.
that's
--
that's
all
that
was
to
that.
now,
the
next
point
which,
i
think,
is
most
important
is
this
and
that
comes
to
19
(a).
the
court
said,
“what
i
am
going
to
do
puts
you
in
the
most
unique
position.
i
am
going
to
assume
you
raising
for
a
motion
to
dismiss
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
you
know
from
reading
the
cases,
that
you
put
your
case
in
at
your
peril,
because
it
might
develop
to
your
disadvantage.”
well,
it's
not
correct
for
the
government
to
represent
to
this
court
that
that
referred
to
the
fact
that
if
a
man
had
taken
the
stand,
they
might
have
asked
him
a
question
on
cross-examination,
was
the
shipment
more
that
$5,000,
because
they
knew,
no
shipment
was
$5,000.
they
were
added
up,
so
that
the
--
that
problem
didn't
come
into
play
at
all
when
the
judge
said
that.
the
--
the
defendant
--
they
had
the
record
of
the
shipments.
so
that
came
in
context
and
you'll
have
to
read,
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
print
by
new
--
it
didn't
--
it
wouldn't
develop
this
way.
between
1429
--
between
1430
and
1434
of
the
transcript,
you'll
see
that
the
defendants,
one
that
there
were
--
had
subpoenaed
stracuzza's
wife
and
there
was
a
question
whether
they
--
she
should
or
could
not
testify.
they
had
witnesses,
the
--
the
wives
of
these
individuals
and
they
thought,
trusting
from
memory,
that
the
case
might
take
another
week
in
order
to
put
their
defense
on.
now,
they
decided
not
to.
i
can't
represent
to
your
honor
the
reason
why
they
cited
because
i
can
only
talk
from
the
record,
but
certainly
when
the
court
says
that
you
put
--
they
--
the
government
can't
represent
that
that
expression
had
to
deal
with
the
--
that
there
was
the
transportation
because
that
was
out
of
the
picture.
no
one
could
say
on
cross-examination
that
any
shipment
was
more
than
$5,000,
because
if
they
could,
the
government
won't
approve
that
on
direct
examination.
they
had
the
record
of
it.
so
to
leave
that
impression
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
we
--
we
make
that
point
in
this
--
in
the
sense
that
at
leading
--
leading
that
in
the
year
for
the
court
to
say
that,
does
affect
the
disposition
of
a
--
of
a
joint
trial,
but
i
cannot
say,
i
cannot
positively
represent
that
as
a
result
of
what
that
took
--
what
he
said,
that
they
did
not
put
on
their
defense.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
expression
like
that,
most
logically,
would.
at
any
rate,
i
only
--
i
never
mentioned
this
on
direct
examination.
i
only
mentioned
it
now,
in
order
to
remove
the
impression
that
the
government
wanted
--
that
the
reason
we
didn't
put
on
was
on
account
of
the
$5,000
that
might've
come
out
in
cross-examination.
now,
all
we've
always
asked
is
for
a
separate
trial
and
that
a
charge
that
there
be
an
aggregation
of
$5,000.
that's
what
we
ask
in
the
lower
court,
that's
what
ask
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
what
we
ask
here.
