mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
here
two
of
the
petitioners
who
were
tried
at
the
same
time
as
schaffers.
i
yielded
part
of
my
time
to
mr.
kossman
because
he
was
treating
questions
common
to
both
of
us.
i
now
wish
to
treat
something
which
is
in
our
brief,
petitioners
marco
and
karp,
and
that
is
the
deprivation
of
a
fair
trial
which
we
claim
and
sue
because
of
the
summation,
the
improper
summation
of
the
district
attorney.
i
must
confess
it
was
a
queer
feeling,
as
i've
said
here
before
and
hear
myself
quoted
and
to
hear
questions
about
why
i
did
thus
and
so
at
the
trial
and
casting
about
the
reasons
--
the
only
reasons
i
could
think
of
it
would
appear
would
be
either
an
aptitude
or
deviousness.
and
as
mark
twain
said,
"if
it
weren't
for
the
honor
of
the
thing,
he
would
just
as
soon
pass
it
up
to
mention."
but
i
have
to
rest
on
the
record
as
it
is
because
i
didn't
make
those
motions
at
the
time
and
your
honors
will
draw
whatever
inferences
you
feel
proper.
but
in
one
respect,
i
did
make
a
motion.
and
i
made
a
motion
for
mistrial
at
the
time
of
the
summation
by
the
district
attorney,
had
brought
to
his
honor's
attention
what
it
felt
was
an
improper
statement
prejudicial
to
my
client.
and
at
the
trial,
i
represented
only
one
client.
here,
i
represent
two
because
that
man
from
west
virginia
just
couldn't
go
on
with
the
case
unless
i'm
willing
to
take
it.
and
since
there
were
no
conflict
of
interest
and
my
other
client
consented
i'm
here
for
both.
what
he
said
was
an
answer
to
what
i
said,
and
in
order
to
put
this
in
proper
focus,
i
must
tell
you
what
i
said.
and
that
brings
me
in
a
full
circle
to
what
the
facts
are
about.
this
case
involved
one
where
three
people,
mario
stracuzza,
anthony
stracuzza
and
dorothy
stracuzza
were
engaged
in
stealing
packages
from
trucks
in
the
garment
district
and
selling
them
on
a
very
large
scale.
in
fact,
the
largest
of
the
scale
was
so
amazing,
it's
like
the
purloined
letter.
i
mean
you
put
it
right
out
in
the
open
and
nobody
thinks
there's
anything
wrong
with
it.
they
had
an
office
with
a
name
on
it,
not
a
telephone
and
credit
bill
heads
and
invoices
and
a
checking
account.
they
held
themselves
out
as
a
discount
house
or
a
job
as
outlet
on
which
there
are
many
in
the
garment
area.
they
bought
about
a
half
million
dollars
worth
of
packages
a
year
from
these
thieves.
they
had
numerous
customers
of
which
these
people
are
only
a
few.
they
kept
books
of
account,
they
mailed
invoices,
they
were
paid
by
check,
and
they
sent
their
things
out
through
the
railway
express,
which
is
the
way
our
people
received
them.
they
were
open
for
business
from
morning
to
night
where
people
came
in
from
a
street
and
from
recommendations
and
bought
from
them.
and
the
stracuzzas,
who
operated
in
this
way
for
a
lengthy
period,
were
all
indicted
by
the
federal
government
in
three
cases,
one,
for
conspiracy
and
the
one
you've
heard
about
in
the
joinder
problem,
one
for
another
conspiracy,
the
phrase
had
posed
it,
and
another
where
they
were
in
conspiracy
with
all
of
the
package
thieves,
dozens
of
them,
drivers
of
trucks.
and
all
three
cases,
mario
and
anthony,
two
of
them,
pleaded
guilty
but
their
sentences
were
held
over
their
heads
until
they
should
have
completed
testimony
in
this
case.
dorothy
stracuzza,
who
was
the
wife
of
anthony,
was
not
required
to
plead.
after
this
plea
and
after
the
stracuzzas
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
government
had
the
goods
on
them,
both
men
said,
"we're
going
to
cooperate
with
the
government."
and
they
started
to
talk
with
the
fbi.
after
this
soul-cleansing
operation
began
and
after
they
had
changed
their
stripes,
so
to
speak,
they
were
both
picked
up
again
for
more
package
thefts
and
indicted
in
the
state
courts.
and
the
district
attorney
and
the
federal
government
hide
themselves
across
the
street
to
make
representations
to
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
of
the
state
court
that
this
man,
as
my
witness,
placed
off,
disposed
of
this
case
until
after
we
use
him
in
our
case.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
he
was
a
necessary
material
witness.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
after
they
pleaded
guilty,
after
they
started
cooperating
with
the
government
in
this
case.
so
i
deemed
that
my
duty
--
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
the
records
--
the
record
is
clear,
your
honor.
they
had
a
book
of
account
in
evidence,
and
they
weren't
all
just
bills
of
lading
and
checks.
there
were
other
evidence
--
there
were
other
documents
in
evidence.
the
record
is
clear
that
they
had
many
other
customers
who
came
in
and
bought
in
the
same
fashion
for
the
same
discounts
and
were
--
sold
goods
of
the
same
nature.
this
was
a
half
million
dollars
worth
a
year,
your
honor.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
i
would
say
they
carried
on
for
a
considerable
period
before
these
defendants
here
were
involved,
and
i
think
that
appears
in
the
record.
it
was
a
matter
of
many
months,
if
your
honor
please.
now,
let
me
come
to
something
the
chief
justice
asked
me
before.
there
is
not
an
iota,
there
is
in
fact
the
government's
own
witness,
principal
witness,
tony
stracuzza
said,
"i
never
told
any
of
my
customers
including
these,
that
the
stuff
was
stolen."
so
they
relied
on
circumstantial
evidence
as
mr.
kossman
told
you.
now,
what
was
the
circumstantial
evidence?
you
mentioned,
your
honor,
these
invoices.
i'd
like
you
to
look
at
the
invoices.
they
were
invoices
with
the
tops
taken
off
so
you
couldn't
tell
who
was
the
sender.
there
were
invoices
with
the
consignee
scribbled
out
illegibly
so
you
couldn't
tell
but
you
could
see
an
identifying
stock
number
perhaps,
the
quantity
and
the
price.
now,
a
discount
house
or
a
job
that
operates
in
exactly
that
way
if
he's
handling
the
goods
of
some
highly
styled
conscious
manufacturer
who
wants
to
sell
his
goods
for
$20
or
loose
cash
in
the
field,
he
doesn't
like
a
discount
house
selling
those
same
goods
to
someone
else
for
$19
or
for
$18
or
$12.
but
sometimes
you
have
broken
lots,
there
are
a
few
sizes.
there
are
undesired
colors
and
in
this
jungle
at
seventh
avenue,
this
is
a
common,
accepted
widespread
practice.
so
when
you
look
at
the
circumstances
which
were
relied
upon
in
this
case
to
fasten
circumstantial
evidence
of
guilty
knowledge
on
this
man,
what
do
we
find?
you
find
these
invoices.
you
find
various
other
things
but
let
me
tell
you
what
else
you
find.
you
find
that
dorothy
stracuzza,
the
wife
under
indictment,
who
worked
in
the
office
with
her
husband
and
her
brother-in-law
from
morning
until
night,
was
the
one
who
prepared
the
invoices,
shall
we
say,
she's
any
better
or
worse
off
than
the
one
who
received
them?
either
one.
she
kept
the
books.
no
one
said
that
my
client
kept
any
books.
she
got
the
checks,
she
mailed
out
the
invoices,
and
she
tore
off
the
labels
and
she
put
the
tickets
on
it.
so
if
there
was
any
invidious
inference
to
be
drawn
from
these
circumstances,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
had
been
in
this
inference
is
at
least
as
worthy
against
mrs.
stracuzza
as
against
any
of
these
defendants.
yet
what
do
we
find?
mrs.
stracuzza
was
never
called
as
a
witness,
either
at
the
package
thieves'
trial
or
in
our
trial.
and
in
fact,
shortly
after
our
trial
and
shortly
after
our
sentence,
the
district
attorney
prepared
and
signed
and
submitted
to
the
court
nolle
prosequi
in
all
the
cases
against
the
lady.
and
they
are
set
forth
in
the
record
here,
if
your
honors
please,
at
pages
--
i
thought
i
was
going
to
do
this
with
a
flourish
but
i
have
to
look.
at
pages
12
--
at
page
12
of
the
record,
and
what
do
they
say?
they
say
that
dorothy
stracuzza
has
admitted
assisting
her
husband
in
this
business
but
has
denied
that
she
had
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
merchandize
handled
by
her
husband
was
stolen.
the
defendant
anthony
stracuzza
in
his
testimony
as
a
witness
for
the
government
stated
that
his
wife
dorothy
never
knew
the
extent
of
the
operations.
as
a
result
of
that,
that
representation
by
the
government
shortly
after
the
completion
of
this
trial,
shortly
after
she
had
not
been
called
or
subjected
to
cross-examination,
on
that
representation,
the
cases
against
her
were
thrown
out.
now,
what
are
the
facts
that
this
record
discloses?
at
this
trial,
her
husband,
tony,
was
under
cross-examination
by
myself.
i
asked
him,
"did
your
wife
know
that
these
things
were
stolen?"
he
said
no.
and
then
i
confronted
him
with
his
testimony
at
the
prior
trial
where
he
had
sworn
under
oath
that
his
wife
had
known
all
about
it,
and
he
said,
"yes,
i
did
testify
to
that
effect."
i
said,
"what
is
the
truth
now?
is
that
or
is
it
this?"
he
said,
"well,
if
you
press
me,
i'll
have
to
say
she
didn't
know
it."
well,
we
left
it
at
that
because
the
truth
wasn't
in
tony
stracuzza
and
i
wasn't
trying
to
get
the
truth
from
him
but
i
was
trying
to
show
what
a
liar
he
was.
because
for
three
days,
i
cross-examined
that
man
to
show
he
was
a
liar
and
i
elicited
the
facts
that
he
was
a
thief
for
many,
many
years,
that
he
had
a
huge
quantity
of
money
and
property
not
accountable
for
by
any
endeavor
that
he
had
ever
reported
to
the
income
tax
people.
that
he
was
a
gambler,
a
loan
shark
and
whatever
you
will,
and
he
admitted
a
lot
of
these
cheerfully
and
in
fact
boastfully.
i
would
say
that
at
the
end
of
his
cross-examination,
he
didn't
look
as
cheerful
as
he
did
at
the
beginning.
i
don't
say
that
in
vainglory
of
my
powers
as
a
cross-examiner,
i
say
it
for
this
reason.
because
we
then
expected
that
they
would
bring
mario
around,
the
other
brother
for
cross-examination.
and
the
reason
mario
was
important,
was
first,
because
he
had
testified
at
the
--
at
the
state's
trial
and
second,
the
government
had
represented
to
the
state
district
attorney
and
the
state
court
judge
across
the
street"please
hold
up
mario's
sentence
because
he
is
a
necessary
material
witness
at
this
trial"
but
they
never
produced
him.
why?
because
they
didn't
want
him
cross-examined,
because
he
was
the
man
who
went
out
and
bought
this
stuff
from
the
thieves.
tony
said,
"i
didn't
buy
from
the
thieves,
it
was
mario."
mario
went
out
everyday
with
a
pocket
full
of
cash,
$1000
to
$1500
everyday
and
came
back
with
packages
and
dumped
them
on
the
desk
and
dorothy
took
the
packages
apart,
stripped
the
labels
off,
put
tickets
on,
did
all
the
busy,
homely,
friendly
little
things
that
people
do
with
packaging.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
but
they
didn't
bring
mario
out
for
cross-examination.
and
i
say
that
it
was
our
defense
and
it
was
our
contention
from
the
opening
consistently
through
the
trial
right
through
the
summation
that
there
was
a
hope
for
a
deal,
i'll
put
it
as
euphemistically
as
i
can,
i'll
say
that
the
stracuzzas
hoped
to
be
benefited
by
their
change
of
heart,
by
their
cooperation
with
the
government.
and
the
hope
was
(a),
that
tony
wouldn't
go
to
jail,
(b)
that
mario
wouldn't
go
to
jail
and
(c),
that
dorothy
wouldn't
go
to
jail.
and
their
hopes
were
realized
to
the
fullest
extent.
not
only
were
they
indicted
here
in
three
cases,
not
only
they
pleaded
guilty
in
three
cases
except
for
dorothy,
but
they
got
suspended
sentences
and
across
the
street
in
a
state
court
where
the
people
are
cooperative.
and
they
use
that
cooperative,
in
the
same
sense
in
which
they
used
it
in
the
knapp
against
schweitzer
case
in
a
very
friendly
sense.
they
--
the
--
they
gave
him
a
suspended
sentence
too.
so
here,
you
have
the
three
stracuzzas
with
their
half
million
dollar
yearly
business
in
stolen
goods
and
sold
stupendously
large
scale
that
would
stagger
the
imagination
going
off
free,
scot
free
because
tony
gave
his
testimony
and
withstood
the
cross-examination
for
three
days
in
a
little
braggy
but
he
was
still
there,
and
they
thought
it
would
be
the
better
part
avow
not
to
put
mario
on
and
they
were
gentlemanly
enough
not
to
subject
dorothy
to
him.
in
addition,
what
else
did
that
accomplish?
when
dorothy
and
mario
were
arrested,
dorothy
had
$900
--
$1900
in
cash
on
her
person
and
mario
had
$900
in
cash
on
his
person.
and
from
the
previous
testimony,
it
was
quite
clear
that
that
was
a
sort
of
money
and
the
type
of
money
they
were
using
everyday
to
go
out
and
buy
stolen
stuff
with.
and
the
government
seized
it
as
evidence
and
impounded
it.
but
after
they
began
to
cooperate,
it
was
given
back
to
them.
i
wanted
to
cross-examine
about
that
too
but
i
couldn't
because
he
didn't
call
mario,
they
didn't
call
dorothy.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
i
ask
your
honor
with
all
seriousness.
here's
a
woman
under
indictment,
could
i
call
her?
she
is
the
wife
of
the
man
who
has
pleaded
guilty
testifying
for
the
government.
could
i
in
all
practical
common
sense
call
her
as
a
witness?
couldn't
she
have
pleaded
the
privilege?
she
was
still
under
indictment.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
she
was
physically
in
the
jurisdiction.
i
yelled
bloody
murder
and
i
say
it's
the
government's
duty
to
call
her.
i
said
the
government
should
call
her
and
i
have
the
right
to
cross-examine
her,
but
they
got
acute
with
me.
they
said,
"no,
you
have
a
right
to
call
her."
and
i
--
i
resented
that
--
that
suggestion.
i
thought
it
wasn't
fair.
so
with
this
background
of
facts,
we
come
now
to
my
summation.
and
i
said
in
my
summation,
and
it's
printed
here
in
the
record,
for
your
honors
to
see
--
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
my
petitioners?
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
one
of
them
went
for
four
years
and
$10,000
of
a
committed
fine
because
21
years
ago,
he
had
been
in
a
bankruptcy
swindle
and
the
other
one
who
had
a
completely
clean
record
went
for
two
years
and
a
$10,000
committed
fine
and
the
two
schaffers
got
a
$10,000
committed
fine
and
two
years.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
that
means
that
you
stay
in
the
clink
until
you
pay
it.
you
can't
get
out
with
a
(inaudible)
at
a
dollar
a
day.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
i
don't
think
(inaudible)
release,
your
honor,
the
way
it
does
in
an
ordinary
fine
but
if
it
does,
i'm
happy
to
know
that.
[laughter]
at
any
rate,
that's
the
background
of
the
summation.
the
summation
went
on
and
it
was
a
cry
to
the
jury,
"where
are
dorothy
and
mario?
why
aren't
they
here?"
now,
the
government
tenders
me
a
short
impingement.
they
say
that
was
shoddy
trial
tactics
and
that
it
justified
the
answer
they
made
to
me.
if
it
does,
your
honors
will
tell
me
that.
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
that
was
a
proper
summation
based
on
the
record,
based
on
my
duty
as
a
counsel
for
a
man
charged
of
crime
and
based
on
this
evidence
as
to
the
type
of
people
i
was
cross-examining
and
it's
a
type
of
thing
i
expected
to
get
from
the
people
who
had
the
right
to
expect
them
to
bring
if
they
wanted
an
objective
search
for
the
truth
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
i
go
with
my
papers
are
mixed
up.
i
know
it's
right
here.
my
--
my
summation
is
on
pages
1,
2
where
--
one
to
eight
and
following
that
immediately
is
the
--
8
to
10
the
government's
summation.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
now,
i'm
not
here
to
plead
for
myself.
i'd
say
to
your
honors
read
it.
if
you
think
that
my
summation
was
improper
in
someway,
then
i
say
to
you
there
are
cases
which
say
that
the
standard
of
advocacy
of
a
defense
lawyer
may
enlarge
the
scope
of
the
standard
of
advocacy
of
the
government.
and
if
i
did
something
improper,
forget
that
part
of
my
point,
but
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
find
that.
what
did
he
say
in
answer?
three
things,
although
i
say
three
things
for
the
purpose
of
handling
it
easily
and
for
the
purpose
of
relating
with
the
cases,
he
said
one
thing
because
the
whole
thing
is
in
a
short
compass
and
i
jumped
up
and
i
said
i
want
a
mistrial.
now,
the
first
thing
he
said,
what
mr.
steinberg
says,
"where
is
dorothy
stracuzza?"
and
he
says,
"i'm
telling
you
that
dorothy
stracuzza
is
still
a
defendant
in
this
case.
the
case
is
still
pending
against
her.
the
indictment
is
still
open
against
her."
now,
i
say
to
your
honors
in
the
context
of
what
was
in
preparation,
in
the
context
of
that
statement
in
the
nolle
prosequi
that
was
filed
shortly
thereafter,
in
a
context
of
accepting
that
nolle
prosequi
the
denial
by
--
by
tony
of
his
wife's
guilt
knowing
that
tony
had
said
something
just
to
the
contrary
under
oath
and
not
pointing
that
in
nolle
prosequi,
in
the
context
of
her
own
denial
of
guilt
but
with
all
the
admitted
circumstances
and
far
more
than
we
used
to
fasten
guilt
on
these
defendants.
i
say
that
was
as
phony
as
a
$3
bill.
i
say
that
was
a
misrepresentation.
i
say
that
does
not
accord
with
the
high
purpose
and
principles
of
a
prosecutor
and
i
say
that
that
was
improper
and
deprived
my
clients
of
a
fair
trial.
what
else
did
he
say?
he
said
this
to
the
other
defendant
mario,
"it
is
the
government's
representation
to
you,"
that
he
could
have
proffered
nothing
in
a
way
of
additional
evidence
that
was
not
presented
to
you
through
to
his
brother
because
if
you
will
recall
from
the
testimony
of
agent
miller,
both
stracuzzas
were
interviewed
on
each
and
every
occasions
by
him,
the
story,
the
testimony,
if
you
will,
given
to
the
fbi
was
a
joint
story
and
therefore,
the
testimony
of
mario
stracuzza,
if
he
will
call
to
testify,
would
be
in
a
sense
a
repetition
of
all
the
details
that
you
heard
from
the
witness
anthony
stracuzza.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that's
for
me.
that
wasn't
because
he
wanted
to
save
the
time
of
the
court.
that
wasn't
because
he
wanted
to
say
repetitions.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
it's
clearly
apparent
that
in
view
of
the
search
and
cross-examination,
mario
had
undergone
at
the
first
trial.
in
view
of
these
items
of
his
money
in
his
pocket,
in
view
of
the
benefits
he
was
getting
across
the
street
on
this
very
court,
i
say
they
wanted
to
protect
him.
and
that's
why
that's
a
misrepresentation
although
it's
proposed
to
be
a
representation.
and
the
third
thing
is
and
this
as
i
said,
tired
cliché
of
advocacy,
this
quotation
of
what
it
says
over
the
department
of
justice,
"the
government
wins
when
justice
is
done
of
citizens
and
the
court".
that's
true.
but
i
don't
like
to
see
that
used
in
this
captious
phony
sense
and
which
is
used
here.
and
when
i
say
captious
and
phony,
i
could
cite
to
you
cases
in
our
brief
where
the
same
quotes
and
the
same
tired
reference
that
same
chiselled
thing
is
made
in
other
occasions.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this.
this
is
not
advocacy
that
heat
of
passion
or
something
said
that
they're
sorry
for
a
moment
later.
if
i
can
understand
that,
i
say
that
all
the
time.
i
say
it
at
home
and
i
say
it
in
court.
this
is
shoddy
tactics.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
on
pages
9
and
10.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
now,
in
making
these
comments
--
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
what
shoddy
is
this,
your
honor?
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
i'll
tell
you
what's
shoddy
about
it.
he
follows
with
this.
if
you
believe
that
the
government
had
in
some
way
or
other,
prevented
you
from
getting
the
full
truth
of
this
entire
case,
that
in
some
way
here
concealed
the
true
facts
pertaining
to
any
of
these
defendants,
you
have
only
one
duty.
you
have
to
march
right
into
that
jury
room
and
acquit
every
one
of
these
defendants.
that's
what's
shoddy
about
it,
mr.
justice
black.
the
cases,
i've
cited
them
in
my
brief,
say
that
when
you
take
away
from
a
jury
the
real
issue
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
a
defendant
and
you
give
them
the
phony
issue
of
trying
this
handsome,
clean-cut,
cultured
fine
young
man
for
impropriety,
no
jury
is
going
to
want
to
convict
him
of
impropriety.
now,
when
you
say
to
--
when
you
say
to
him,
"here's
this
clean-cut,
handsome
young
boy
with
a
good
law
school,
speaks
well,"
is
obviously
the
kind
of
board
or
jurors
would
be
proud
to
have
who
he
suddenly
stands
up,
they're
doing
his
duty
against
some
people
under
indictment
that
if
you
believe
i
did
anything
wrong,
i
quit.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
citing
the
berger
case
of
this
court
says
that's
bad,
it's
reversible,
dump
to
it
because
it's
tendering
a
false
issue.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
your
honors
would
have
given
me
certiorari
in
this
point.
i
don't
know
whether
your
honors
are
primarily
interested
in
the
points
mr.
kossman
talked
about,
but
it
was
in
my
heart
to
bring
you
this
point
because
the
time
has
come,
so
many
years
after
the
berger
case
to
get
the
word
around
in
the
federal
courts
that
this
is
not
the
way
to
try
a
case
because
the
same
cliché,
the
same
exact
phrases
come
up
in
case
after
case.
young
fellows
are
learning
how
to
try
cases
and
they
think
this
is
the
way
to
try
the
case
unless
you
tell
them
differently.
from
the
cases
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
you
will
find
repeated
references
to
berger.
berger
had
a
good
effect
on
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
last
five
years
has
had
five
cases
touching
on
summations,
propriety
or
propriety
summations
reversed
in
every
case
and
citing
berger,
but
it's
losing
its
steam.
and
i
say
to
your
honors
you
will
do
a
service
to
the
dying
out
of
advocacy
if
you
tell
us
how
to
try
a
case
and
put
teeth
into
what
you
tell
us,
and
say,
"this
is
not
the
way
to
do
it."
thank
you.

mr.

brief,

mr.
harris
b.

mr.
moran.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
if
i
can
--
i
just
--
one
moment
--
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
just
one
moment,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
about
whether
this
was
only
a
new
york
doctrine
or
a
federal
doctrine.
let
me
just
tell
you
about
two
cases.
(inaudible)
was
second
circuit
decided
very
recently
by
three
different
judges
and
sat
on
this
case,
judge
waterman,
judge
lumbard,
judge
moore.
they
reversed
the
conviction
where
they
said
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt.
and
they
reversed
because
the
counsel
for
the
defendant,
in
his
summation,
said
that
the
bail
of
the
informer,
that
is
the
government
witness,
the
bail
had
been
lowered
and
as
soon
as
he
agreed
to
cooperate
that
was
done
and
therefore,
he
had
every
motive
for
lying.
that
was
the
defense
summation.
and
in
answer
to
that,
the
district
attorney
said,
"they'll
ask
you
to
draw
the
deduction
that
i
made
a
deal,
i
never
make
deals"
and
that
was
the
word.
now,
that's
weak
and
in
our
case,
it
was
reversed.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
(inaudible)
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
the
other
is
lovello
in
new
york
court
of
appeals,
1
n.y.2d.
here's
what
the
d.a.
said
there,
"there,
the
defense
summation,
counsel
criticized
the
prosecutor
for
failing
to
have
and
produce
one
witness."
so,
why
didn't
he
produce
that
witness
so
i
can
cross-examine?
the
d.a.
said
this,
"if
that
conversation
didn't
take
place,
stop
right
there.
don't
waste
another
10
seconds
on
this
case.
come
back
and
say
the
defendant
is
not
guilty.
if
that
conversation
didn't
take
place,
i'm
an
aid
on
a
federal
perjury."
that's
all
it
was.
court
of
appeals
cited
berger
and
said
this
is
tendering
his
own
integrity
as
an
issue.
it's
a
phony
issue.
the
issue
was
is
he
guilty
or
innocent.
thank
you.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
your
honor,
if
you
will
read
my
summation
--
--
there
was
not
one
--
no
--
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
no.
there
is
not
one
word
in
my
summation
saying
the
district
attorney
was
a
crook.
i
said
stracuzza
was
a
liar,
perjuring
himself
to
win
his
statement
with
the
d.a.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
there
are
two
rules
on
that,
your
honor.
now,
let
me
say
--
let
me
--
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
--
just
say
this.
there
are
two
rules.
there's
one
line
of
cases
that
says
what
i
said
before
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
he
said
that
if
you
set
a
low
standard
of
advocacy,
you're
hung
by
your
own
petard
or
hoist
by
your
own
petard.
you're
--
you're
stuck
with
it.
and
if
they
come
back
at
you
in
the
same
(inaudible)
brain,
you're
stuck
with
it.
there's
another
line
of
cases
that
says
maybe
you
can
be
a
shyster
but
the
government
doesn't
employ
shysters.
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
i
say,
depends
on
which
line
of
cases
he
follows.
mr.
harris
b.
steinberg
that's
not
the
argument
i
make
here.
i
don't
have
to
make
that
argument.
