justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
--
is
this
your
position
that
under
the
rule,
under
rule
8,
if
they
have
not
charged
a
conspiracy,
they
could
not
have
joined
the
allegation
or
indictment,
in
those
substantive
counts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
the
judge
dismissed
the
conspiracy
trial,
didn't
let
it
go
to
the
jury,
then
you
were
in
the
same
position
as
you
would
have
been
had
the
indictment
obtained
no
conspiracy
count,
it
was
the
judge's
duty
as
a
matter
of
law
irrespective
of
presence
of
--
of
the
prejudice
to
grant
your
motion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part
of
that
now
you're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
is
shoddy
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
shoddy
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
our
record,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
the
same
attorney,
prosecuting
attorney
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
different
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
this
man
have
--
have
anything
to
do
with
the
speech
made
by
the
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
made
the
speech
of
the
complaints
made
about
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
made
the
speech
of
the
complaints
made
about
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
moran.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
want
to
find
out
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
did
think
since
this
is
the
record
in
another
case,
we
should
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
have
part
of
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
should
have
it
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i
don't
--
i'm
still
a
little
lost
with
this
thing.
what's
the
relationship
in
time
of
the
statement
by
this
man
(inaudible)
in
the
trial
of
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
october.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
appendix
says
filed
october
8
this
year.
i
don't
know
what
that
meant,
page
1.
this
other
one
seems
to
have
been
made
in
(inaudible)
1956.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
two
years
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
says
september
19th,
1956.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
the
same
--
was
it
for
the
same
theft?
so
is
this
some
different
theft?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
davis
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
this
footnote
says
that
they
tried
to
offer
this
in
evidence
so
it's
probably
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
they
tried
to
get
this
in
evidence
to
show
what
the
government
--
the
promises
they
had
made.
are
--
have
they
assigned
that
as
they
were
in
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he
says
is
defense
counsel
vigorously
protested
the
prosecutor's
refusal
to
call
them,
tried
unsuccessfully,
that
was
used
in
evidence,
the
complete
statement
which
were
made
by
the
government
to
the
sentencing
judge
at
the
time
mr.
stracuzza
was
given
a
suspended
sentence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
probably
here
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
probably
here
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
may
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
mr.
davis
that
i
have
this
stenographic
report
here
that
you
refer
us
to.
it
does
refer
to
his
offering
here
saying
the
judge
read
part
of
it.
it
was
read
to
the
jury,
part
of
the
fact
that
the
man
was
given
a
lighter
sentence
on
the
ground
that
he
cooperated
with
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
was
at
the
time
i
assume
was
the
trial
because
he
opened
to
his
objection,
they're
not
putting
in
half
of
the
state.
the
judge
led
him
to
remain
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
at
page
670
to
678
of
the
stenographic
report.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
steinberg.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
realized
as
much
in
what
you're
saying,
but
i
see
here
the
last
sentence
you
stated
was,
after
accusing
them
that
they're
making
a
deal,
that
they
sold
in
set
the
30
pieces
of
silver,
is
it
your
position
that
if
you
do
accuse
the
district
attorney
of
being
crooked,
that
it
--
it
entitles
him
to
new
trial
if
he
denies
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
just
read
both.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
asking
you
was
this.
is
it
your
position
that
if
you
do
accuse
the
district
attorney
of
being
crooked
and
it
can
be
inferred
that
he's
accused
of
taking
money
and
making
deal
that
if
he
denies
making
the
deal,
that
the
case
should
be
reversed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
it
your
position
that
if
you
do
accuse
the
district
attorney
of
a
crooked
deal,
that
he
can't
deny
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
--
i'm
just
talking,
is
that
the
argument
you're
making?
