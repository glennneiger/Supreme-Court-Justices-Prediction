justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
--
i
am
sorry,
i
tried
to
call
you
but
i
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
state
that
the
case
is
--
are
you
--
did
you
state
what
the
case
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
doing
it
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
three
substantive
counts
against
three
unrelated
defendants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
the
three
independent
substantive
offenses
were
consolidated
for
trial,
they
were
consolidated
with
a
conspiracy
charge
against
those
three
defendants
as
defendants
under
the
conspiracy
indictment,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
from?
i
don't
follow
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
11
(a),
you
said
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
that
in
the
docket
entries
on
page
2
(a)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
defendants
renew
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
and
for
a
new
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
decision
reserved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
well,
i
don't
see
what
you've
read
and
make
out
case,
because
you
--
that
a
promotion
for
severance
was
renewed.
that's
not
such
an
esoteric
motion
--
motion
that
one
has
to
imply
from
words
asking
for
a
totally
different
kind
of
relief.
did
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
merit
was
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
severance
should
have
been
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand.
there
are
two
questions
under
mr.
kossman.
one,
whether
a
motion
for
severance
is
as
you
think
you
contest
in
this
case
that
they
made
that
motion
and
would
have
made
it
in
terms.
i
mean
that
at
the
most
a
rarer
thing.
one,
whether
a
motion
for
severance
the
granting
of
which,
assuming
that
the
starting
point
was
incontestable
and
not
objectionable
as
you
answered
justice
harlan,
whether
at
a
later
stage
there
should
have
been
a
severance
order.
and
as
to
that
you
say
the
government
says
that
a
motion
for
severance
was
not
made
and
i
don't
think
what
you
read
there
as
it
was
made.
but
as
i
understand
it
there
is
another
question
whether
a
motion
for
severance
or
not
in
principle
to
try
three
people
for
conspiracy
and
to
try
the
same
three
people
unrelated
to
the
substantive
offenses
is
intrinsically
prejudicial
way
of
conducting
a
trial.
and
it
is
that
latter
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
on
the
merits,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
proceed
to
discuss
that,
instead
of
trying
to
find
in
the
record
a
motion
to
severance
or
no
motion
for
severance
that
was
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
in
the
case,
they
called,
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
them
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
appealed.
so
why
do
you
take
your
time
arguing
something
that,
here
by
virtue
of
fact,
was
adjudicated
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
mean
is
that
you
can't
pair
it
out
whether
there
was
prejudice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
can't
--
it's
impossible.
your
argument
on
this
point
is
not
just
--
even
if
there
was
no
prejudice,
you
mean
to
say
one
can't
find
out
whether
there
was
or
wasn't
prejudice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in
the
hearing
in
the
situation.
it's
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
this
has
got
to
do
with
our
system
of
government,
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
just
said
that
if
there
were
12
men
in
that
box
and
could
make
all
the
differentiations
and
it
would
keep
apart
to
new
york
together
with
--
had
a
double
set
of
bookkeeping
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
assumed
even
then
it
wouldn't
be
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
abstract
proposition
you're
offering,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
concrete?
you
haven't
told
us
yet
why
it's
concrete.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
three
defendants
was
--
were
west
virginia,
massachusetts
and
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
was
this
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
your
sit
down
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
motion
--
the
original
motion
of
severance,
was
that
in
writing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
did
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
in
the
record,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is?
i'd
like
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it
was
in
this
(inaudible)
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
the
fact
that
it
was
made
but
the
--
the
document.
is
the
document
printed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
could
you
have
filed
with
the
clerk
the
copy
of
the
motion
--
the
original
motion
of
severance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
could
you
file
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
--
it's
here,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
--
your
--
you
didn't
file
one
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
client
didn't
say,
didn't
say
they
drive
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
i
mean
you
thought
so,
but
i
didn't
suppose
that
--
that
the
--
the
court
didn't
discretion
even
when
there
is
a
conspiracy
not
to
drive
this
up
to
the
offenses
--
separate
offenses
together.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
had
any
case
like
this,
in
which
it
is
conceded,
as
i
understand,
that
the
joinder
was
proper,
valid,
not
--
not
even
contested,
like
some
of
the
defendants,
except
by
one
defendant.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
--
there's
only
by
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
on
the
basis
of
this.
where
the
--
where
the
joinder
was
not
contested
or
where
no
question
is
now
raised
that
that
was
improper
to
begin
with,
but
where
the
basis
of
joinder
namely,
immunity,
all
defendants
were
involved
in
conspiracy
where
the
basis
of
joinder
fails
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case.
have
we
had
any
case
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
in
the
kotteakos,
we
had
the
whole
--
we
had
several
conspiracy
united
at
a
single
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand,
as
i
recall,
i
haven't
reread
it
directly
to
this
problem.
in
kotteakos,
as
to
(inaudible)
the
difficulty
was
the
multiplicity
of
a
non-coextensive
conspiracies
among
different
defendants,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
weren't
there
also
some
questions
of
the
basis
on
which
it
was
left
to
the
jury
finally,
where
there's
a
confusion
whether
it
has
one
or
several?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
--
from
my
--
from
my
reading
or
for
my
thinking
on
this
subject,
there
were
questions
in
those
cases
that
are
independent
of
a
problem
of
propriety
of
joinder?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
had
the
trial
been
on
when
the
conspiracy
charge
is
taking
from
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
want
to
know
how
--
how
many
days
of
trial
there
as
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
how
many
more
days
of
trial
were
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
ended
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
was
--
was
the
--
was
there
ever
a
suggestion
at
any
--
at
any
time
in
the
course
of
the
trial
that
the
conspiracy
charge
was
included
in
the
indictment
and
was
true
horn
to
get
in
the
joinder?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
denies
it
at
the
end.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
does
the
phrase
--
i
noticed
that
the
phrase
in
the
present
--
in
the
present
--
in
our
rule
8
(b)
or
a
series
of
acts
or
transactions,
connected
together
was
used
by
chief
justice
fuller
in
mcelroy.
you
know
the
argument
of
that?
it
goes
with
a
--
with
a
prior
case?
is
the
mcelroy
case
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
pointer
case
was
against
the
same
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here's
--
i
understand
it,
but
where
does
it
come
from?
there
is
no
rule
in
its
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
common
law
at
all,
of
course,
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
i
want
to
know
what
they
argument
with
the
--
if
as
chief
justice
fuller
in
mcelroy,
the
thing
that
or
the
--
mr.
justice
harlan
did
in
pointer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
i
don't
suppose
the
judge
or
did
the
judge
know
when
he
denied
this
motion
that
he
had
before
him
all
the
evidence
there
would
be
in
the
case?
in
other
words
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
until
i
hear
the
rest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
basis
for
saying
that
the
defendants
might've
been
influenced
not
putting
in
a
case,
but
resting
on
the
government's
case
because
of
--
that
the
joinder
up
to
that
time
that
had
made
it
difficult
to
dissever
the
unrelated
testimony
of,
at
least,
one
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
that,
what's
the
basis
for
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
only
issue
they've
contested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
on
the
basis
of
the
occurrence
of
cross-examination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
judge
disclose
his
mind,
why
he
thought
there'd
be
no
prejudice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say,
in
this
case,
we're
fortunate
in
having
a
charge
that
a
sufficient
justification
for
me
to
say
that
i
think
it
would
help
in
all
criminal
cases
that
come
here,
if
the
government
sought
that
you
always
had
the
full
text
of
the
charge
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
our
record,
not
in
the
stenographic
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
make
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
make
this
case,
what
--
what's
that.
i
don't
follow
that
mr.
davis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
proves
that
there
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
--
he
--
and
he
proves
the
$5,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
the
--
does
the
proof
of
$5,000
as
to
one
of
the
three
defendants,
take
care
of
the
indictment
against
them.
you're
coming
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
anticipate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
invoices.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
witnesses
were
there
in
the
--
for
the
government,
in
number?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
the
defendants
had
--
how
many
trial
counsels
were
there
for
the
defense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
as
the
record
--
would
the
record
show
that
the
stenographic
minute
that
each
of
the
15
witnesses
or
whatever
they
were,
are
separately
cross-examined
at
length
by
the
different
defendants,
or
is
there
a
good
deal
of
taking
over
by
someone
loyal
for
the
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
pages
are
there
in
this
two
weeks
trial,
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1600.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
days
as
chief
of
the
government's
reliance
on
the
stand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
of
the
1600
pages,
how
many
are
taking
up
by
the
--
by
the
government's
witness,
by
the
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
half
of
--
half
of
the
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
on
for
a
week
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
is
of
half
the
trial
worthy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
quickly
summarizing
exactly
what
the
figures
are
with
reference
to
the
shipments?
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
that
again
individually.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
--
this
is
--
these
may
have
been
innocent
shipments.
i
mean
shipments
as
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
necessarily
tainted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(inaudible),
but
that
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
of
knowledge
is,
of
course,
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
sum
total
of
shipment
that
went
to
each
one
these
defendants
as
$45,000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
aggregating
shipment
of
the
three
as
against
anyone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
100
--
100
shipments
of
$50
worth,
spread
over
a
year,
in
your
view,
would
--
would
satisfy
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
might
have
a
problem,
if
you
haven't
go
here,
namely,
the
problems
of
statute
of
limitations
as
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
part
of
your
case.
that
was
not
part
of
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
did
it
appear
how
long
they
carried
on
this
kind
of
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
sought
to
infer
this,
mr.
davis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
me
what
the
present
practice
in
the
southern
district
is?
does
the
district
attorney's
office
make
recommendations
either
as
to
the
length
for
the
sentence
or
suggest
suspension
for
the
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judge
is
there
and
the
district
is
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
some
judges
wouldn't
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
this
--
try
to
say
something
more
than
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
against
the
stracuzzas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wasn't
it
not
--
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
go
on,
and
i'll
ask
you
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
to
assume
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
presumably
is
it
to
presume
or
is
it
known
the
stracuzzas
was
offense
on
a
large
scale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
like
me
--
$500,000
or
half
a
million
was
a
staggering
amount.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
--
is
it
an
irrelevant
item
in
the
fabric,
isn't
it?
what
other
items
in
the
--
in
the
talk
about
who
could
have
called
who
and
for
what
purposes?
is
it
irrelevant
to
--
to
a
judgment
on
government
summation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
we
haven't
got
that
case
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
--
with
what
we
have
is
that
--
that
a
united
states
attorney
made
any
statement
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
in
treating
a
states
witness
is
lenient
in
favor
but
--
but
if
this
recital
sounds
like
the
arabian
nights
almost,
it's
true
and
is
relevant
to
a
judgment
on
the
representation
he
made
to
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
they're
in
the
same
office
and
unless
things
are
very
different,
assistants
talk
to
one
another,
this
isn't
a
--
they're
not
isolated
from
one
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
like
--
i
forget
which
one
of
dickens'
novels
said
--
says
this
is
my
wicked
partner
if
you
--
justice

if
you
will
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
there
the
indictments
in
which
the
stracuzzas
were
tried
and
our
indictment
handed
down
the
same
time
by
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
these
thieves
had
53
transactions,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
on
proposed
stenographic
minutes
of
the
trial
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
would
be
in
there
although
it
was

justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
what
took
place
at
the
other
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
sitting
down?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
off
to
another
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
the
gravamen
of
the
--
that
were
placed
or
the
argument
is
not
that
the
government
was
wrong
not
to
call
but
rather
that
the
united
states
attorney
put
to
the
jury
pitted
his
integrity
and
rectitude
as
against
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
gravamen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
now,
so
that
it
doesn't
--
merely
to
say
that
the
government
should
or
shouldn't
have
called
taking
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
item?
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
even
if
they
did
incur,
you
don't
say
it
doesn't
answer
if
(inaudible).
it
doesn't
answer
the
suggestion
that
you
can't
send
the
12
jury
men
and
women
into
the
jury
room
and
say,
"well,
we
either
must
acquit
or
if
we
don't,
we
must
find
that
u.s.
attorney
would
give
him
misconduct."
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
because
they
have
to
decide
whether
he
was
justified
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
not
calling
mario
and
the
lady.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you.
i
don't
mean
to
say
to
--
to
control
of
my
thinking
but
i'm
--
is
it
true
that
--
that
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
found
that
inadmissible
argument
by
the
district
attorney
to
put
such
an
issue
to
the
jury?
has
a
new
york
case
look
that
way,
i've
been
looking
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
how
is
it
made
except
by
making
such
an
argument?
is
there
any
other
way
of
making
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
that
is
an
--
if
you
say
the
federal
courts
--
federal
decisions
say
you
can't
do
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
--
how
is
--
or
is
there
a
departure
from
that
standard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
been
bought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
did
mr.
steinberg
say
that
the
government
rested
on
perjured
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
exact
words
put
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
is
more
than
--
i'm
a
little
rusty
on
it,
but
to
--
even
if
you
give
a
state's
witness
to
plea
freedom
in
this
kind
of
transaction,
it's
a
little
generous,
isn't
it,
on
part
of
the
government?
would
the
court
--
it's
a
little
generous
to
be
urging
the
court
to
suspend
a
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
feel
a
little
decency
if
--
if
the
record
would
show
on
the
practice
in
the
southern
district
whether,
no
district
judge
pays
any
attention
and
he
forbids
a
u.s.attorney
to
make
recommendations.
i
have
known
judges
to
do
it
in
particular
cases.i
have
known
some
judges
who
refuse
to
allow
the
government
to
make
any
suggestion
at
anytime
in
any
case
where
the
government
is
an
active
participant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
troubled,
i
must
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
there
was
this
earlier
suspension,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
accumulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
assumes,
i
think,
mr.
davis,
that
if
going
through
this
record,
one
finds
that
the
case
against
him
was
conclusive
after
you
overlooked
impropriety.
i
don't
think
that's
the
rule,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
wouldn't
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
no
proper
evidence
for
--
but
if
saying,
you,
in
order
not
to
convict
these
people
would
have
to
find
out
that
i'm
a
crook,
i
mean
the
u.s.
attorney,
that
i
would
regard
as
the
height
of
impropriety
no
matter
how
good
the
--
the
defendants
are
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
must
be
tried
and
convicted
according
to
(inaudible)
and
that
is
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
it
is.
all
right.
