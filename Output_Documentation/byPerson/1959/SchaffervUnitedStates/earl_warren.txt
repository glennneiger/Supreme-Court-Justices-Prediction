chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
is
there
--
is
there
any
significance
to
the
judge
holding
up
his
ruling
on
that
motion
and
then
admonishing
the
defendants?
now,
i
warn
you
to
put
any
evidence
in,
you
might
be
doing
it
to
your
detriment,
because
i
will
use
that
against
you.
is
there
any
--
is
there
--
is
that
a
fair
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
know,
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
one
other
thing
i
--
i
noticed
this
morning,
when
--
when
counsel
was
reading,
i
think,
it
was
on
page
13
(a).
he
says,
“as
your
honor
knows,
there
are
over
200
exhibits
involving
over
1000
sheets
of
paper
here.”
do
you
--
what
significance
do
you
give
to
that
on
the
complexity
of
the
--
of
the
case,
when
they're
all
being
tried
together.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
says
200
exhibits
and
1000
sheets.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering,
mr.
davis,
there
were
three
stracuzzas,
who
were
charged
in
this
conspiracy
and
was
it
one
--
one
or
more
of
them
who
had
pleaded
guilty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
two
of
them
pleaded
guilty.
i
wonder
why
they
--
why
they
didn't
try
the
third
one
with
these
people,
when
they
tried
them
on
the
conspiracy
charge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
go
right
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kossman.
chief
justice
earl

he
is
a

a

witness?

mr.
steinberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
those
alleged
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
those
alleged
offenses
after
they
had
pleaded
guilty
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
also,
mr.
steinberg,
when
you're
speaking
about
the
openness
of
their
business,
keeping
books
and
having
hundreds
of
people
come
in
there,
could
anybody
have
gone
in
there
and
bought
at
the
same
price
that
these
people
pay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
what
happened
to
your
--
these
petitioners?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
what
was
the
setting?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
you've
--
you've
served
the
two
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
what
--what
do
you
have
to
say
to
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
5,
so
the
sentence
in
court
asked
the
prosecutor
whether
this
was
an
isolated
offense
referring
to
stracuzza
and
the
prosecutor
replied
in
the
affirmative
but
the
--
the
court,
"are
there
any
other
larcenies
that
these
men
are
connected
with?"
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
an
isolated
larceny,
mr.
cantor
(ph),
as
far
as
the
government
knows.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
--
understood
from
mr.
steinberg,
if
they
were
doing
this
business
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
or
$1500
everyday
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
they
would
have
in
cash
and
they
would
pay
it
up
for
these
stolen
goods.
how
could
it
possibly
be
answered
that
this
was
an
isolated
case
and
this
was
all
that
was
against
them?how
could
it
--
how
could
they
answer
such
a
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
think
if
that
was
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
their
brief
that
you
would
investigate
it
to
find
out
what
the
situation
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
--
why
did
they
dismiss
mrs.
stracuzza
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
her
husband,
when
he
testified
in
this
case
that
she
didn't
know
anything
about
it
and
admitted
that
he
had
testified
in
another
proceeding
that
she
had
known
all
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
said
of
course,
if
the
government
produced
perjurious
testimony
that
would
be
another
situation,
isn't
that
perjurious?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
it
might
--
it
might
go
along
ways
to
show
what
motive
prompted
him
to
testify
as
he
was
testifying
in
this
case
if
he
went
so
far
as
to
testify
to
the
opposite
of
what
he
testified
to
in
another
case
shortly
before
it.
and
consequently,
counsel
would
be
entitled
to
comment
on
that
very,
very
strongly,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
one
moment,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
steinberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
