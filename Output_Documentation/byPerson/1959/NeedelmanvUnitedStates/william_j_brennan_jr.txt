justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
indicate
whether
the
notes,
request
to
which
was
made
were
examined
by
the
trial
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
appear
that
this
case
report
purported
it
to
be
prepared
from
any
notes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
warren,
let
me
see
if
i
follow
you.
i
would
--
i
gather
you're
saying
that
the
literal
language
of
subdivision
(b)
after
a
witness
called
by
the
united
states
has
testified
on
direct
examination.
the
court
shall
in
the
motion
of
the
defendant
order
the
united
states
to
use
any
statement
and
they
don't
have
to
find
of
the
witness
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
which
relates
to
the
subject
matter
as
to
which
the
witness
has
testified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
face
of
it,
it
includes
these
notes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
statement
is
defined
in
(e)
(1),
a
written
statement
made
by
said
witness
and
signed
or
otherwise
adopted
or
approved
by
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
also
literally
applied
at
least
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
include
these
notes.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
he
presently
testifies
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
if
he
wrote
them
in
his
own
handwriting,
he
must
have
approved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he,
i
gather
was
what,
a
narcotics
agents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
one
of
our
discovery
theory
that
none
of
us
knows
what's
in
those
notes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
he
said
he
refreshed
his
recollection
from
them,
they
related
to
his
investigation.
the
judge
didn't
look
at
them
and
no
one
has
ever
seen
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
may
i
ask
then,
mr.
davis?
is
that
to
say
that
if
these
notes,
whatever
they
were,
had
been
delivered
by
this
particular
narcotics
agent
to
his
superior
for
safety,
examination
or
what
have
you.
you
would
not
say
that
the
statute
did
not
cover
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notes,
just
put
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
files.
where
they're
available
to
examination
by
his
superior
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
that
be
one
of
communication?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
you've
developed
but
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
put
a
distinction
based
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
take
it
particularly
if
it's
not
more
than
--
put
it
and
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
you
require
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
thought
that
--
i'd
just
telling
here
is
none
of
his
notes,
what's
in
these
notes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
found
out
whether
they
still
exist
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
ask,
mr.
davis,
at
page
93.
i
would
understand
there's
an
omission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
there's
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
that's
all
there
is.
but
because
a
short
recess
of
that,
then
this
followed
denial
of
motion
protects
the
notes.
and
my
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
question
is,
was
there
during
that
recess
a
motion
for
production
of
notes,
colloquy
thereon,
which
was
not
reproduced
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
is
that
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
where
is
the
request
for
the
notes
to
which
they
defined
they
--
they
filed
request.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
must
have
been
a
request
denied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
because
you
have
already
answered
justice
stewart
that
the
motion
at
page
8
was
denied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
find
it
in
the
record
any
action
of
the
court
denying
that
motion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis,
that
--
that
--
it
would
appear
that
during
this
recess,
there
was
some
kind
of
motion
made
and
there
must
have
been
some
argument
attached
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
get
ruling
but
we
don't
get
the
--
the
motion,
we
don't
know
what
the
forms
of
request
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
of
the
omissions,
do
you
suggest,
the
deficiency
is
just
here
and
you
conspire
to
prevent
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
not
recorded.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
davis,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
what
became
crucial
at
the
trial
was
agent
rudd's
testimony
that
dr.
needelman
had
in
effect
told
him
that
he
knew
these
prescriptions
were
being
given
to
narcotics
addicts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
well,
dr.
needelman
denied,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
so
that
on
--
on
the
question
--
as
i'm
looking
at
page
139,
there's
a
statement
in
the
report
from
the
original
report
that
at
that
point,
dr.
needelman
voluntarily
and
spontaneously
stated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
he
had
left
those
prescriptions
with
those
addicts
when
he
left
for
europe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
dr.
needelman
denied,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
became
really
a
crucial
factor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
crucial
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
crucial
at
least
in
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
original
report
to
indicate
that
this
is
a
summary
of
the
agent's
notes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
can't
tell
that
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
don't
know
then
whether
there
was
recorded
by
the
agent
at
the
time
of
this
conversation
with
dr.
needelman,
the
substance
of
the
conversation,
we
don't
know
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
original
report
which
indicates
the
lapse
of
time
from
the
date
of
the
interview
with
dr.
needelman
where
he
made
the
submission
according
to
agent
rudd
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
preparation
of
the
report?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
know
how
long
this
crucial
interview,
i
used
the
word
“crucial”
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
took
place?
how
long
it
lasted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
suppose
that
the
notes
of
that
interview
had
nothing
like
this
statement
of
the
agent
in
them
that
might
have
been
very
important
to
the
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
well,
in
that
same
connection,
may
i
ask,
mr.
davis,
was
the
conspiracy
trial
before
the
same
judge,
judge
choate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
referring
to
the
trial
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
gave.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it
--
it
might
--
might
be
significant
as
to
this
--
what
seems
to
me
a
rather
a
little
discussion
on
this
motion
comes,
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
party
--
the
counsel
or
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
and
judge
might
from
the
prior
trial
have
known
what
each
was
talking
about
and
that
had
been
a
lot
more
cryptic
in
another
way
in
this
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
seem
--
as
i
recall
--
am
i
right?
neither
of
them
mentioned
it
explicitly
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
i
think
you
said
to
us
yesterday,
however,
that
at
least
at
the
agent's
notes
has
been
transmitted
to
his
superior,
i
don't
think
he
went
by
this
far,
if
he
merely
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
his
file.
but
nevertheless,
with
all
the
imperfections
which
you
suggested
appear
in
such
notes,
yet
they
would
qualify
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
suppose
--
i
notice
you
have
them
on
that
envelope
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
forwarded
them
and
merely
said,
“my
notes
are
in
this
envelop.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
very
package
of
notes,
i
gather,
this
record
shows,
had
been
transmitted
as
i
have
suggested
in
the
final
report.
it
would
have
been
producible,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
know
whether
the
fact
is
or
not
that
that
package
was
transmitted
to
his
superior,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
you
told
us
that.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
what
did
we
mean,
do
you
think,
then,
mr.
davis,
what
we
said
in
jencks,
the
court
held
in
goldman
that
the
trial
judge
had
discretion
to
deny
inspection
when
the
witness
“does
not
use
his
notes
or
memoranda
relating
to
his
testimony
in
court”?
we
now
hold
that
petitioner
was
entitled
to
an
order
directly.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we're
--
we're
--
i
thought
this
argument
was
on
the
premise
that
this
is
something
not
discoverable
under
terms
of
the
jencks
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
they
are
notes
which
were
used
admittedly
by
the
witness
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
refresh
his
recollection
before
he
took
the
stand.
and
i
thought
you
said
that
those
might
still
be
producible
to
the
defense
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
under
the
goldman
rule
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
except
as
the
goldman
rule
may
have
been
affected
by
what
i
just
read
to
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
unless
you
said
contrary
here
at
jencks.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
in
--
when
goldman
tried,
had
there
been
any
development
of
requirements
of
this
nature
before
the
trial
judge
call
upon
exercise
of
discretion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
again,
we're
faced
here
with
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge,
so
far
as
the
record
appears,
had
no
knowledge
or
whatever
of
the
contents
of
these
notes.
he
never
looked
at
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
you
could
carry
that.
it
may
--
could
be,
i
suppose,
in
that
hiatus
and
the
jury
was
sent
out
and
then
his
motion
was
acted
for
production.
some
of
the
things
that
you
say
should
have
been
done
--
may
have
been
done
but
they're
not
in
the
record
because
apparently,
whatever
that
colloquy
was,
it
was
not
transcribed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
you're
carrying
this
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
was
up
to
the
defense
counsel
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
this,
mr.
davis,
is
that
the
action
on
the
motion
was
taken
down
stenographically
transcribed
because
it's
in
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
that
preceded
the
court's
action
appears.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
warren,
now,
was
the
first
trial
before
another
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
the
same
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose,
mr.
warren,
this
might
also
have
happened,
prosecutor,
defense
counsel
and
judge
choate,
that
he
did
try
the
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
case.
had
been
all
through
this
on
a
go-around
for
all
that
appears,
everything
that
now
seems
missing
here
may
all
have
been
developed
in
the
first
trial
and
judge
choate
had
refused
to
turnover
the
notes
and
they
just
persisted
in
that.
