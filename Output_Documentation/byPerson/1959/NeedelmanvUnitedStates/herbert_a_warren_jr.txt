mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
further
reference
to
questions
asked
by
justice
harlan,
there
is
also
a
comment
by
the
trial
court,
judge
choate
on
page
18
of
the
record
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
embracing
the
petitioner
upon
probation,
he
makes
a
statement,
“i
do
that
for
the
reason
that
i
still
believe
that
perhaps
you
were
just
careless.”
that's
my
understanding
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
not
in
this
court.
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right,
but
there
were
no
questions
posed
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
now,
it's
my
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
it's
my
understanding
that
it
was
before
the
same
judge,
judge
choate.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
fact
that
the
motion
which
was
made
subsequent
to
the
conspiracy
trial
and
before
the
consolidated
trial
refers
specifically
to
the
fact
that
the
agent,
rudd
had
testified
at
the
first
trial,
and
that
the
contemporaneous
notes
were
testified
to
at
that
trial
and
states
--
which
said
contemporary
notes
have
already
been
referred
to
by
the
said
agent
rudd
in
the
previous
trial
of
the
said
cause
and
by
which
testimony,
it
was
shown
that
said
contemporaneous
notes
prepared
by
the
said
run
were
of
the
events,
activities
related
to
the
said
testimony.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
appears
on
page
8
of
the
record,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
--
it
was,
i
believe,
a
renewal
of
that
motion
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
said,
“we
assume
in
response
to
a
renewal
of
this
motion.”
the
judge
then
made
his
ruling,
“i
will
deny
the
request
for
the
notes
because
they
may
involve
many
things.”
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
in
framing
our
questions
and
our
petition,
we
did
set
forth
that
the
motion
was
made
prior
to
trial
and
then
renewed
after
the
witness
had
testified
and
we
claimed
that
the
trial
judge
in
denying
the
motion
did
commit
error
in
not
following
the
procedures
of
the
statute.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
they
come
in
the
93
for
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
tried
after
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
a
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
statement.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
it
is
my
assumption
that
and
i
can
say
from
speaking
to
trial
counsel
that
the
motion
was
renewed.
it
is
not
reflected
in
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
renewed
as
far
as
production
of
the
contemporaneous
notes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
they
are
the
same
notes,
the
notes
that
had
been
referred
to
in
the
first
case
and
where
again,
the
subject
of
the
discussion
in
the
second
case.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
statement
in
the
motion
for
--
for
production
of
documents.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
on
page
8.
yes,
sir.
the
motion
specifically
says
particularly
the
--
the
documents
which
are
requested
particularly,
the
contemporaneous
notes
made
by
the
government
witness
kenneth
rudd
who
has
previously
testified
in
said
cause
and
who
is
a
material
witness
for
the
government
in
said
cause
made
by
the
said
kenneth
rudd
during
his
investigation
in
preparation
for
trial
of
said
cause
and
which
said
contemporaneous
notes
have
already
been
referred
to
by
the
said
rudd
in
the
previous
trial
of
said
cause.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
there
had
been
discussion
over
that
first
trial,
as
shown
by
this
motion.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
i
will
say
this,
that
it's
our
position
that
it's
not
necessary
for
the
defendant
to
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
indeed,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
nothing
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
tried.
i
assumed
and
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
--
i
fairly
saw
that
when
the
judge
says,
“i
will
deny
the
request
for
the
notes,”
that
there
must
have
been
a
request
for
the
notes.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
fancible
in
the
least,
mr.
justice.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
as
to
the
case
report,
which
was
filed
here
by
the
government,
i
think
mr.
davis
made
a
statement
which
points
out
the
significance
of
that
report
very
clearly.
he
described
it
as
what
the
government
could
rest
its
case
upon.
now,
this
report
was
made
some
six
weeks
after
the
interview
with
dr.
needelman.
it
was
made
some
two
weeks
after
the
indictment
had
already
been
returned
in
the
first
case.
and
i
think
it's
obvious
from
reading
it
that
the
government
was
preparing
their
case
for
trial
and
there
can
a
world
of
difference
between
what
the
witnesses
were
testified
to
and
the
recording
of
the
events
made
as
those
events
actually
happened.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
government
seems
to
try
to
make
their
distinction
on
whether
or
not
the
notes
were
communicated,
and
i
submit
that
the
communication
adds
nothing
to
the
value
of
the
notes,
the
primary
point
considered
by
this
court
in
the
jencks
case
and
i
think
the
primary
point
of
the
statute
is
the
fact
that
the
witness
himself
has,
at
a
time,
when
his
memory
was
fresh,
made
a
notation
as
to
what
occurred.
and
if
he
just
puts
that
in
his
pocket
and
never
looks
at
it
again
until
he
takes
the
witness
stand,
it
still
just
as
valuable
to
the
defense
and
cross-examination
and
just
as
valuable
in
ascertaining
the
truth
of
what
actually
happened
at
the
time
that
he
made
that
recording.
now,
this
court
in
jencks,
of
course,
over
turn
the
idea
that
we
--
that
the
defense
counsel
had
to
show
any
inconsistency
between
the
prior
statement
of
the
witness
as
a
prerequisite
to
having
it
produced.
and
i
think
the
contention
of
the
government
now
to
place
upon
the
defense,
the
burden,
if
you
wish
to
use
that
word,
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
notes
would
be
intelligible
would
fall
within
the
same
category.
it's
our
position
that
the
jencks'
case
holds
very
clearly
and
very
precisely
that
the
only
thing
which
is
necessary
to
be
shown
is
that
the
witness
has
made
a
prior
statement
relative
to
his
testimony.
and
when
that
appears,
everything
which
is
necessary
for
production
purposes
has
been
shown.
this
court
in
jencks
referred
back
to
the
decision
in
the
gordon
case
and
said
for
production
purposes,
it
need
only
appear
that
the
evidence
is
relevant,
competent
and
outside
any
exclusionary
rule.
when
it
appears
that
the
witness
who
is
testifying
has
made
a
prior
statement
concerning
his
present
testimony,
certainly
his
prior
statement
is
relevant.
he
made
himself
so
it's
competent.
he's
already
testified
so
there
is
no
exclusionary
rule
or
evidentiary
privilege
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
the
same
principle
has
appeared
because
it
is
the
fact
that
the
witness
has
made
a
prior
statement.
in
the
jencks
case,
it
was
a
witness
who
had
made
a
statement
to
a
government
agent,
but
it
was
his
statement,
and
the
court
said
it
was
his
statement
could
probably
be
used
to
impeach
him
and
therefore,
should
be
produced.
the
same
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
think
the
primary
consideration
is
that
you
can
impeach
the
government
witness
but
only
by
his
own
statement.
now,
if
it's
a
witness
who
is
not
a
government
agent,
the
report
is
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
they
can
claim
an
exclusionary
privilege
there.
jencks
says
that
that
exclusionary
privilege
does
not
apply
where
the
witness
has
testified
and
it's
his
report
producing.
so
you
can
impeach
him
with
it.
here,
you
have
one
step
eliminated
because
the
agent
is
the
witness
himself,
for
the
witness
is
the
agent.
there
is
already
the
exclusionary
privilege
there
but
once
he
testifies,
then
his
prior
statement
no
longer
has
that
exclusionary
privilege,
it
is
just
as
competent
to
impeach
him
as
was
the
reports
of
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
--
witnesses
in
the
jencks
case.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
absolutely.
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
is
the
basic
calling
of
the
jencks
case
in
my
--
in
my
opinion.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
you
question
then,
because
in
our
situation
where
the
government
agent
is
the
witness,
the
government
is
certainly
vouching
for
his
testimony
and
if
he
has
notes
in
the
possession
of
the
agent,
they
are
just
as
much
notes
of
the
united
states
as
if
they
have
been
put
in
some
other
file.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
we
asked
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
and
it's
our
position
that
all
we
need
to
show
is
that
they
--
the
notes
are
relevant
to
his
prior
testimony
and
once
that
it
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right.
he
made
notes
during
his
investigation
then
he
testified
as
to
his
investigation.
now,
if
the
government
wants
to
claim
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
but
we
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
right,
sir.
we
think
that
after
we
had
showed
just
what
we
had
shown,
there
was
then
the
burden
of
the
government
to
assert
that
it
does
contain
a
relevant
matter
and
at
that
point,
then
the
judge
steps
in
under
the
statute
and
makes
the
determination
as
to
what
portions
are
relevant
and
should
be
turned
over
and
what
portions
are
not.
now,
as
to
some
of
the
cases,
as
to
the
procedure
followed
by
defense
counsel
in
requesting
production
of
the
notes,
i've
already
mentioned
the
jencks
case.
in
that
case,
the
defense
attorney
moved
for
an
order
directing
an
inspection
of
reports
dealing
with
meetings
about
which
he
--
the
witness
had
testified.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
motion.
there
was
nothing
further
done
by
defense
counsel
in
any
request
that
the
judge
examined
the
notes
in
camera
or
that
the
notes
be
made
a
part
of
the
record.
in
the
holmes
versus
united
states
case
in
our
brief
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
agent
testified
as
to
his
investigation,
the
defense
then
demanded
production
of
the
memoranda
and
report
prepared
during
his
investigation
and
recording
its
result.
the
file
was
tendered
to
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
declined
to
read
the
reports,
place
a
responsibility
upon
the
fbi
agents
and
the
prosecution
to
determine
which
reports
should
be
delivered.
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
that
was
error
to
do
that,
that
the
statute
places
an
affirmative
duty
upon
the
trial
judge
himself
to
make
the
determination
once
the
government
asserts
that
the
notes
or
the
document
does
contain
any
irrelevant
matter.
in
the
bradford
case
of
the
ninth
circuit,
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
the
examination
by
defense
counsel
of
the
government
agent
was
very
similar
to
the
examination
in
this
case.
he
asked
him,
“did
you
make
notes?”
and
in
fact,
he
said
he
did.
“you
refresh
your
recollection
with
those
notes?”
“yes.”
counsel
then
requested
production
of
the
notes.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
motion
for
production.
the
trial
counsel
again
said
that
he
wanted
the
notes
produced.
the
court
then,
on
its
own
volition,
examined
the
notes,
determined
that
they
should
not
be
handed
over,
handed
them
back
to
the
witness.
they
were
not
made
apart
of
the
record
in
the
case.
there
was
no
request
by
the
trial
counsel
that
they
be
made
a
part
of
the
record
of
the
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
appellant's
counsel
in
this
case
did
nothing
less
in
the
trial
counsel
in
the
jencks
and
reversed
the
trial
court
because
of
its
action
in
that
regard.
now,
we
say
that
we've
done
everything
necessary
in
this
case
to
get
production
of
the
notes.
if
the
government
wanted
it
to
assert
that
they
did
contain
irrelevant
matter,
they
should've
done
so,
then
the
judge
would
step
in
and
make
the
determination.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
same
as
it
is
now.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
far
as
goldman
is
concerned,
perhaps
it
still
has
some
validity
where
the
document
is
not
fairly
attributable
to
the
witness
himself.
if
it
is,
that
the
witness
is
using
a
summary
of
someone
else
to
refresh
his
recollection,
then
perhaps
the
trial
judge,
in
his
discretion,
can
require
the
production.
but
where
the
document
is
the
witnesses'
own
document,
goldman
can
have
no
further
application
because
if
it
is
his
own
document,
then
it
is
producible.
i'd
like
to
close
with
just
an
adoption,
if
i
may,
of
the
words
of
mr.
davis
which
he
used
before
this
court
in
argument
on
lev
versus
united
states
and
other
connected
cases.
in
arguing
with
reference
to
summaries
made
by
agents
of
witnesses'
testimony,
it
was
suggesting
that
counsel
could
call
the
agent
himself
and
cross-examine
him.
and
in
response
to
a
question
to
mr.
justice
black,
that
if
the
agent
denied
the
purpose
contained
in
the
summary,
then
mr.
davis
made
the
statement
then
the
memoranda
could
be
produced
since
it
was
the
agent's
own
document
and
would
be
producible.
and
i
think
that
very
well
sums
up
the
entire
law
and
reason
applied
to
this
case
and
to
this
situation.
the
notes
for
rudd's
own
document
and
since
it
was
his
own
document,
it
would
be
producible.
thank
you.
