justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
at
this
point
to
state
what
the
case
before
was
or
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
but
what
was
it?
what
was
--
can
you
tell
us
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
this
elicited
through
a
bill
of
--
for
a
bill
of
particulars
or
how
did
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
what
was
the
vehicle
for
bringing
it
to
the
attention
of
counsel
for
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
how
did
the
judge
know
there
was
a
case
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
presumes
that
the
matter
must
have
been
somewhere
of
it
before
the
judge
and
in
--
and
certainly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
a
consideration
in
his
denial
of
the
motion
for
the
--
for
the
refreshing
notes.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
can
you
tell
me
what
use
if
any
was
made
of
the
case
report
by
defendant's
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
none?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
say
it's
useless
if
it
simply
didn't
think
served
any
of
his
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
don't
know
anything
about
this.
all
--
i
mean
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
is
there
--
well,
let
me
ask
this
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
more,
that
tells
us
anything
about
the
notes,
the
nature
of
--
except
the
nature
of
how
they
were
made
and
for
what
purpose,
what
the
judge's
knowledge
was
or
wasn't
with
reference
to
the
notes,
what
the
judge's
knowledge
was
or
wasn't
with
reference
to
the
case
report
on
the
basis
on
which
he
ruled
that
you
may
have
seen
the
case
report?
is
there
anything
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
don't
know
--
we
don't
know
anything
except
those
--
there
are
those
un-illuminating
few
words
as
to
what
went
on
as
this
--
at
the
short
recess.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
why
he
ruled
against
the
motion
to
produce
the
notes
and
why
he
said
you
may
have
this
--
the
case
report,
the
presentation
of
which
or
the
projection
of
which
into
the
case
we
know
nothing
about.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page

justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
there
in
the
record
or
what
are
the
--
what
references
can
you
give
us
in
the
record
which
indicate
the
nature
of
these
notes
in
the
sense
of
when
they
were
made,
what
they
purported
to
be,
etcetera,
etcetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
“well,
you
made
copious
notes
at
the
time
you
started
the
investigation
of
this
case.”
does
that
state
notes
of
whose
--
whose
statements
or
what
statements
or?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
make
a
lot
of
difference
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
feel,
indicates
the
relation
between
the
--
the
person
from
whom
statements
or
the
references
statements
are
made
and
the
recording.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
why
it's
not
within
3500?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
made
by
a
government
witness
or
prospective
to
an
agent.
you
mean
these
are
notes
made
--
he
is
the
witness
and
he
makes
these
notes
to
himself
about
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
you
have
to
read
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
made
by
government
witness
or
prospective
witness
through
an
agent
of
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
means
that
the
agent
takes
down
a
statement
made
to
him
by
somebody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
witness
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
dealt
with
all
that
in
--
in
palermo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we've
also
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
said
that
that's
an
exclusive
statute
and
not
a
--
and
not
a
puzzle
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
dealing
how
it
is
with
the
other
question
outside
of
the
statute?
i'm
--
my
questions
are
restricted
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
application
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
speak
on
the
face
of
it,
it
doesn't
apply
to
this
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
statements
weren't
delivered
to
the
government
or
to
anybody,
even
notes,
like
the
notes
that
you
and
i
make
if
we
hear
something
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
we
hear
something
with
reference
to
hearing
it,
even
notes
to
ourselves
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
calling
yourself
up
on
the
telephone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
any
estimate,
any
--
any
characterization,
any
profiles
that
the
government
agent
have
to
having
a
very
good
impression
with
somebody
makes
--
makes
for
himself
--
to
himself,
as
to
the
piece
of
literature
comes
within
the
jencks
act,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
that,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
was
does
statement,
where
does
any
evidence
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
these
were
recordings
of
what
the
witness
told
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
know
what
about
what
because
it
says
he
made
copious
notes
at
the
time
he
started
the
investigation.
it
doesn't
say
he
made
notes
of
what,
dr.
needelman
told
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
these
were
recordings
of
statements
made
to
the
agent
by
dr.needelman,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
all
you
know,
the
notes
might
be,
this
is
my
child's
birthday
and
that's
why
i've
fixed
the
date
in
which
i
talked
with
needleman,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
come
to
that,
the
statute
lays
down
what
kind
of
recordings
or
what
they
must
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
all
we
know,
he
has
made
the
notes
of
people
whom
he
--
whom
he
talked
with
before
every
his
suspicion
was
directed
to
needleman,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
all
we
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
might,
you
refresh
your
recollection
by
the
fact
that
it
was
a,
that
it
was
the
hardest
day
for
--
what
is
it
yesterday?
april
23rd
and
he's
still
in
washington.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
it
--
was
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
refuted
from
--
from
what
is
and
asking
him
for
this
that
you
put
down,
what
the
defendant
said
to
you?
did
you
--
are
these
notes
on
your
conversations
with
needleman?
did
this
judge
shut
off
that
line
of
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
really,
palermo,
said
the
adoption
and
approval
must
be
of
the
recorded
statements,
whose
statements
they
purport
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
talk
about
literal
as
though
there'd
been
no
decision
or
opinion
in
palermo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you're
trying
here
was
to
search
the
truthfulness
of
the
statement
of
the
narcotic
agent
in
relation
to
needelman
in
the
light
of
what
needelman
purportedly
had
said
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
laying
out
the
slightest
foundation
for
suggestion
that
these
notes
were
recordings
of
statements
made,
contemporaneously
by
needelman
to
the
agent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
investigation
precedes
any
kind
of
talk
with
needelman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying
that
you
might
have
been
entitled
to
the
--
to
these
notes.
i'm
suggesting
you're
wholly
outside
the
basis
for
making
the
automatic
production
of
the
notes
through
the
jencks
statute.
my
questions
are
entirely
directed
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
at
all
a
judgment
anymore
than
anybody
else
can
tell
what're
in
these
notes.
i'm
suggesting
that's
not
the
necessary
foundation
laid
for
what
the
jencks
statute
requires.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
this
in
the
print?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
there
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
what
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
--
what
is
then
the
stenographic
administrative
trial
which
indicates
the
motion
was
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
just
said,
this
was
inserted
by
our
clerk.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
ask
again.
was
there
a
denial
of
a
motion
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
stenographic
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
that
was
just
the
caption
there
for
the
headline.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
our
clerk
in
putting
this,
the
running,
the
printed
lines?
justice
felix
frankfurter
direct
examination
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
those
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
would
you
mind
looking
that
up
--
would
you
mind
looking
that
up
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
smallest
view
of
what
there
is,
the
stenographic
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
there
is
with
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
this
is
current
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
review
what
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
court
of
appeals
was
reviewing
what
was
before
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
more
than
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
more
than
that.
of
course
the
stenographer
couldn't
record
anything
that
didn't
take
place.
there
was
no
request
by
the
defendant
counsel
that
has
--
appear
on
the
record.
for
these
--
in
these
reasons,
we've
made
this
and
this
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
denied,
we
accept.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
to
prevent
that
being
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
the
very
good
reason
that
it
--
that
if
other
things
had
been
done,
the
court
appeals
might
have
reached
another
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
i
--
finish
your
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
did
this
question
of
the
production
of
the
notes
take
place?
did
that
occur
at
the
first
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
but
couldn't
it
be
relevant
to
that,
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
is
you
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
inquiry
was
made
of
the
witness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
during
--
on
--
on
the
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
it
a
common
place
thing
when
counsel
go
into
private
talk
with
the
court,
and
then
make
motions
which
are
desired
not
to
be
made
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
or
have
discussions
not
desired
to
be
heard
by
the
jury
with
any
ruling
by
the
court
adverse
to
a
party,
it
is
then
formally
stated,
a
motion
of
this
sort
was
made
and
denied,
the
--
the
most
commonplace
thing
in
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
used
the
word
“burden”
as
though
this
is
a
heavy
load
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
somebody
has
to
carry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
that
required
counsel
to
say,
counsel
moved
the
court,
asked
the
court
to
look
at
the
record
and
look
at
the
notes
we
questioned,
and
the
court
declined.
that's
all
that's
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
burdensome
as
though
you
put
a
ton
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
appellate
court
knows
what
has
been
done
and
whether
what
was
done
was
right
or
wrong
or
was
allowed
the
discretion
or
not
allowed
the
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
case
--
the
--
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
was
that
a
claim
made
here
and
asking
for
review?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
it
wasn't
even
presented.
it
wasn't
merely
--
the
court
restricted
it.
but
i
--
let's
look
at
it.
the
petition
was
granted
without
restriction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
warren,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
i
quite
understood
or
at
least
appreciate
you
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question.
the
motion
that
has
been
denied
--
the
motion
that
was
denied
as
you
quoted
on
page
9
and
10.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
motion
to
which
reference
is
made
on
page
93
to
deny
the
request
for
the
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
i
don't
understand
that.
when
you
say
the
motion
was
renewed,
you
mean
the
motion
that
was
formally
--
that
was
denied
the
record
--
the
recording
of
denial
of
which
on
page
9
and
10
was
renewed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
there
is
no
reference
in
that.
it
seems
to
me
a
totally
different
transaction
in
88.
there
was
testimony
about
these
notes
and
then
there
was
this
recess,
and
i
will
deny
the
request
for
the
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
now
saying
that
the
motion,
the
pretrial
motion
on
page
9
was
--
were
those
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
is
that
we
--
have
we
got
--
is
the
motion
here
identifying
what
was
the
--
the
motion,
the
order
on
motion
is
for
the
production
of
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
then
in
this
record
that
would
enable
me
to
see
--
to
say
that
the
motion
for
production
of
documents
was
the
motion
for
the
production
of
these
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
this
mean
that
--
what
i
asked
mr.
davis,
that
this
--
the
production
of
these
notes
had
emerged
at
the
first
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
that
makes
all
the
most
significant
to
me
at
least,
that
in
examining
rudd
about
these
notes,
no
questions
were
asked
as
to
the
nature
of
the
notes
as
to
the
bearing
of
inconsistency,
as
to
the
potential
conflict
and
above
all,
in
asking
the
court
to
look
at
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
what
it
is
that
was
put
before
the
trial
judge
on
which
he
ruled
and
on
the
basis
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
what
it
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
basis
on
which
the
case
comes
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
there
anything
to
prevent
trial
counsel
from
having
it
recorded
that
they
asked
judge
choate
to
look
at
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
nothing
appears
that
such
a
request
was
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
yes,
they're
not
(inaudible)
nothing
appears
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
such
a
request
was
maybe
either
at
the
first
trial
or
in
the
second?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
at
the
time
you
started
the
investigation
of
this
case,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
made
notes
that
this
doesn't
refer
to
notes
made
weeks
before
he
ever
talked
--
the
day
before
he
ever
talked
about
the
needelman.
and
that
he
talked
to
other
people
who
then
led
him
for
--
talk
with
whom,
led
in
to
dr.
needelman.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
--
he
said
lied
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
jencks
--
the
jencks
case
was
a
confrontation
of
present
testimony
of
a
witness
reported
to
a
government
agent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
against
a
report
made
by
government
agent
of
a
prior
statement
by
that
witness,
is
that
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
it's
irrelevant
that
the
government
now
offers
a
witness
who
says
--
now
offers
as
a
government
official
who
says,
the
witness
made
this
and
this
statement
to
me,
and
that
same
government
official
previously
made
a
report
of
the
same
statement
by
that
witness.
do
you
think
that
(inaudible)?
those
are
quite
unimportant
facts
in
the
determination
of
the
decision
of
the
jencks
case
fully
apart
from
the
fact
of
what
the
jencks
statute
did
to
the
jencks
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
are
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
i
testified
in
something
subject
to
cross-examination
and
it
appears
that
i
scribbled
some
notes
which
i
looked
at
before
i
testified
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
without
law,
just
that
fact,
requires
the
trial
court
to
make
me
produce
my
notes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
jencks
case
had
taught
me
different
situation.
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
government
in
vouching
for
a
witness
who
now
makes
one
report
of
his
talk
with
the
--
with
the
person
and
previously
had
filed
another
report
of
his
(inaudible).
and
those
things
seem
to
you
immaterial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
think
that's
so.
but
in
the
second
place,
you
didn't
ask
for
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
ask
for
the
judge
to
pass
on
whether
or
not,
in
the
interest
of
general
fairness,
there
is
any
reason
for
having
the
witness
who
is
also
a
person,
a
private
person
producing
private
jotting,
that
i
remember
this
day
because
it
was
my
son's
birthday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
show
that.
you
simply
--
you
didn't
show
that.
you
didn't
ask
the
judge
to
determine
that.
you
simply
prove
that
at
the
beginning
of
his
investigation,
he
made
some
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
assuming
everything
when
you
say
that
they're
relevant
to
this.
you
draw
that
relevance
merely
from
the
fact
that
he
made
jottings
to
--
not
--
not
just
memory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
have
a
date
what
--
made
the
notes
about
afford
to
had
anything
to
do
with
what
he
testified.
and
you
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ask
the
court
to
examine
that
and
make
his
own
judgment
about
it.
