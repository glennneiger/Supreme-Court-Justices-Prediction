mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
upon
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
questions
presented,
stated
briefly
are
as
follows.
first,
whether
the
contemporaneous
notes
of
a
government
agent
made
during
the
course
of
his
investigation
are
producible
under
the
statute,
title
18,
section
3500
where
that
government
agent
takes
the
witness
stand
and
testifies
as
to
his
investigation
as
a
witness
for
the
government.
there's
also
presented
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
goldman
versus
united
states
to
the
effect
that
the
trial
judge
has
the
discretion
to
deny
production
and
inspection
of
the
contemporaneous
notes
and
memoranda
of
government
agents
where
the
government
agents
have
refreshed
their
recollection
from
such
notes
but
have
not
done
so
on
the
witness
stand,
whether
such
rule
has
been
overruled
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
jencks
versus
united
states.
as
an
adjunct
to
the
questions,
there's
also
presented
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
trial
court
in
this
particular
case
in
denying
production
of
the
contemporaneous
notes
of
the
government
agent
could
be
characterized
as
harmless
error.
as
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
petitioner
who
has
a
position
was
first
indicted
along
with
a
druggist
on
a
charge
of
conspiracy
to
violate
the
provisions
of
title
26,
section
4705
(a),
that
is
a
conspiracy
to
sell
certain
narcotic
drugs
without
the
requisite
written
orders
as
prescribed
by
the
statute.
that
case
was
tried
and
resulted
in
a
mistrial.
after
the
mistrial,
a
second
indictment
was
returned
against
the
petitioner
solely
naming
him
in
15
substantive
counts
charging
in
each
of
the
counts
that
he
sold
or
caused
to
be
sold
the
narcotics
not
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
statute.
the
two
cases
were
consolidated
for
trial.
after
the
trial
on
the
conspiracy
charge,
but
prior
to
the
trial
on
the
consolidated
cases,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
moved
the
court
on
order
requiring
the
government
to
produce
certain
documents
and
included
in
that
motion
a
request
for
the
contemporaneous
notes
of
the
narcotic
agent,
rudd
setting
forth
in
the
motion
that
the
agent
rudd
had
testified
at
the
first
trial
and
had
--
and
his
testimony
shown
that
the
notes
related
to
his
investigation
and
as
to
the
events
which
he's
testified
to
in
the
first
trial.
the
motion
was
denied
in
all
material
respects
as
far
as
this
case
is
now
concerned.
the
case
proceeded
to
trial.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
it
is
not
an
issue
here
although
i
might
state
in
passing
that
it
is
my
belief
that
the
motion
made
would
come
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
but
it's
solely
presented
to
the
court
today.
we
are
relying
upon
the
fact
that
the
motion
was
renewed
during
the
course
of
the
second
trial.
the
case
proceeded
to
trial
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case.
the
court
granted
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
as
to
the
conspiracy
cases.
at
the
end
of
the
--
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case,
the
petitioner
again
moved
for
a
judgment
of
--
of
acquittal.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
commenting
that
in
his
view,
it
was
a
very
slender
case,
but
he
thought
that
there
was
enough
to
go
to
the
jury.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
to
each
of
the
15
substantive
counts.
a
motion
for
new
trial
was
made
and
was
granted
as
to
five
of
the
counts
which
were
substantly
--
subsequently
dismissed
by
the
government.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
agent
--
narcotic
agent
rudd
while
on
the
stand
testified
on
cross-examination
that
he
had
made
copious
notes
during
the
course
of
his
investigation
and
that
he
had
refreshed
his
recollection
from
such
notes
prior
to
coming
to
court
to
testify.
there
was
--
after
agent
rudd
had
testified
on
direct,
cross
and
redirect,
a
recess
was
taken.
after
the
recess,
this
appears
in
the
record.
the
court
makes
the
statement,
“i
will
deny
the
request
for
the
notes
because
they
may
concern
many
things.
you
may
see
the
case
report.”
the
case
proceeded
on
as
i've
said
to
the
conclusion
and
a
finding
of
guilty
by
the
verdict
as
to
each
and
by
the
jury
as
to
each
of
the
15
substantive
counts.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
case
report
has
been
filed
by
the
government
as
an
exhibit
in
this
case.
now,
the
case
report
was
not
made
a
part
of
the
evidence
at
the
trial.
i
did
not
try
the
case,
but
i
have
consulted
counsel
who
did
represent
the
defendant.
i
have
showed
him
the
transcript
of
record
with
the
case
report
as
filed
by
the
government.
he
says
to
the
best
of
his
recollection
that
is
what
was
handed
him
--
to
him.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
it
was
presented
to
him
at
trial.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes.
yes,
sir.
it
appears
in
the
record
starting
at
page
138.
it
appears
that
it
is
in
effect
a
trial
brief
of
the
testimony
to
be
presented
by
the
various
witnesses
in
the
case.
it
is
composed
by
narcotic
agent
rudd
signed
by
him
and
agent
waters
and
it
relates
as
the
testimony
that
the
prospective
witnesses
for
the
government
will
give
when
they
are
called.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
arose
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
had
requested
the
contemporaneous
notes
and
memoranda
of
the
agent
rudd.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
court
said,
“i
will
deny
your
request
for
the
notes.
you
may
see
the
case
report.”
then
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right,
sir
and
that
is
not
reported
in
the
record.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
none.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
none.
it
proved
absolutely
useless.
the
record
will
reflect
that
there
is
no
cross-examination
of
the
agent
rudd
based
upon
anything
that
came
from
the
case
report.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
and
it
was
not
used
as
far
as
the
record
here
reflects.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
must
assume
that
they
were
not
because
the
judge
said,
”that
they
may
concern
many
things.”
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir
i
cannot
say
that
it
does.
the
government
does
contend
that
it
does
show
that
it
was
prepared
from
the
contemporaneous
notes
but
i
cannot
say
that
it
was
because
i've
never
seen
the
notes.
the
trial
judge
has
never
seen
them
and
they
were
not
preserved
in
the
record.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
all
we
have
in
the
record
is
the
motion
for
production
made
between
the
two
trials
where
the
defense
asked
for
the
contemporaneous
note
of
the
agent
rudd
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
--
specifying
in
the
motion
that
they
had
been
referred
to
in
the
prior
case.
that
they
did
relate
to
the
testimony
of
the
agent
rudd.
then
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
agent
rudd
that
he
did
make
copious
notes
during
the
course
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
--
of
his
investigation
and
he
did
refer
to
those
notes
to
refresh
his
recollection.
then
we
have
solely
the
statement
out
of
the
court
that
he
would
deny
the
request
for
the
notes
because
they
may
involve
many
things,
you
may
see
the
case
report.
that
is
all
there
is.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
court
has
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
here
it
is.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
93,
sir.
“i
will
deny
the
request
for
the
notes,
because
they
may
involve
many
things.
you
may
see
the
case
report.”
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
now,
with
reference
to
the
case
report,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
it
is
dated
october
31st,
1955.
the
first
indictment
in
this
case
as
appears
from
page
1
of
the
record
was
returned
on
october
the
18th,
1955.
so
the
indictment
had
already
been
returned
before
the
case
report
was
ever
prepared.
now,
the
primary
issue
as
far
as
the
--
the
author
anderson
saw
the
petitioner
in
this
case
turned
upon
his
good
faith
and
dispensing
the
prescriptions.
it
was
the
evidence
of
the
government
to
prove
that
he
had
gone
on
a
vacation
to
europe
that
he
had
left
numerous
signed
prescriptions
with
his
nurses,
with
instructions
to
dispense
them
to
certain
persons
upon
solely
the
payment
of
a
certain
fee.
dr.needelman
denied
giving
any
such
request.
it
was
his
evidence
that
they
had
been
left
there
because
he
had
two
doctors
assisting
him
in
his
practice
to
its
--
yet
had
not
been
licensed
to
practice
and
that
the
prescriptions
were
to
be
dispensed
only
upon
their
say
so.
one
of
the
main
points
as
far
as
his
good
faith
is
concerned
is
that
the
agent
rudd
in
his
testimony
stated
that
when
he
interviewed
the
petitioner,
the
petitioner
stated
to
him
that
he
knew
that
the
persons
involved
were
narcotic
addicts.
dr.
needelman
denied
that
he
ever
made
any
such
state
--
statement
and
denied
that
they
were
in
fact
narcotic
addicts.
now,
as
far
as
the
first
question
is
concerned,
it
is
our
position
that
the
contemporaneous
notes
of
an
agent
made
during
the
course
of
his
investigation
are
producible
under
the
statute
when
the
agent
takes
the
stand
and
testifies
as
a
witness
for
the
government.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
cross-examination
of
agent
rudd
where
he
stated
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
page
88.
question,
“you
made
copious
notes
did
you
not
at
the
time
you
started
the
investigation
of
this
case
and
made
several
notes?”
“yes,
sir.”
“and
you
have
refreshed
your
recollection
from
the
notes
that
you
made,
refreshed
your
memory.
before
coming
to
testify,
you
refreshed
your
memory
by
reference
to
those
notes,
did
you
not?”
that
is
on
page
88,
a
little
of
two-thirds
all
the
way
down
the
page.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
and
in
our
view
it
makes
no
difference.
if
the
agent
takes
the
witness
stand
and
testify
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
--
i'll
say
this
that
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
notes
must
be
relevant
to
his
testimony.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
notes
must
be
relevant
to
the
facts
that
he
testified
to
at
the
trial.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
we're
not
seeking
production
of
the
notes
as
in
--
as
a
statement
of
a
third
person,
as
was
the
case
in
the
palermo
case
recently
decided
by
this
court.
we're
taking
the
position
that
the
agent
himself
is
the
witness.
these
notes
which
he
made
are
sought
as
his
own
statement,
not
as
a
statement
of
some
other
person.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
think
very
definitely
it
is,
your
honor,
but
then
the
language
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
he
makes
the
notes
concerning
the
events
that
he's
testified
to
at
the
trial.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
alright,
sir.
if
you'll
look
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
how
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
is
the
language
of
subsection
(a)
of
the
statute
but
that
restriction
is
not
placed
in
subsection
(b)
of
the
statutes.
subsection
(b)
says
only
after
a
witness
called
by
the
united
states
has
testified
on
direct
examination.
the
court
shall
in
a
motion
of
the
defendant
order
the
united
states
to
produce
any
statement
they
see
in
it.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
of
the
witness,
yes
sir,
as
hereinafter
defined.
now,
i'll
direct
your
attention
to
the
provisions
of
subsection
(e),
and
the
interesting
fact
that
in
defining
the
term
“statement”
under
subsection
(e),
it
refers
solely
to
subsections
(b),
(c),
and
(d)
and
does
not
refer
to
subsection
(a)
which
is
limited
solely
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes
sir,
you
dealt
with
--
that
in
palermo
as
far
as
a
statement
given
by
a
witness
to
a
government
agent
where
the
witness
is
on
the
stand
and
you're
seeking
from
the
government,
the
statement
which
that
particular
witness
gave
to
a
government
agent.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes.
you
said
it
was
an
exclusive
statute
so
far
as
statements
given
by
government
witnesses
to
government
agents
is
concerned.
but
that
is
not
the
situation
here
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
and
it's
our
contention
that
under
subsection
(b)
and
the
other
portions
of
the
statute
that
it
does
apply
and
it
is
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
may
i
suggest
that
the
reason
for
subsection
(a)
is
to
show
that
congress
is
adopting
a
policy
so
that
it
would
leave
no
doubt
but
that
statements
given
by
a
witness
to
the
government
are
then
subject
to
an
--
claim
of
evidentiary
privilege
by
the
government.
the
fact
that
they
are
really
the
statement
of
the
witness
might
lead
you
to
think
that
the
evidentiary
privilege
cannot
be
granted.
congress
makes
that
clear.
if
that
statement
of
the
witness
is
transmitted
to
the
government
and
becomes
in
the
possession
of
the
government,
the
claim
can
then
be
asserted.
but
under
subsection
(b)
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
right,
sir.
and
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
is
my
argument.
yes,
sir.
and
now
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
is
my
position
as
far
as
the
first
point
is
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
there
was
notes
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
his
recordings
of
the
events
that
transpired
during
the
course
of
his
investigation.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
cannot
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
when
i
used
the
word
recording
i
mean
the
fact
that
he
made
notes
which
constitute
recordings.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i'll
admit
that
if
--
the
notes
maybe
entirely
irrelevant
but
that
is
no
basis
for
denying
their
production
under
the
statute.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
he
was
testifying
as
to
his
conversation
with
dr.
needleman
primarily.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
he
said
that
he
had
refreshed
his
recollection
before
coming
to
testify.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
there
will
be
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
the
entire
point
of
it.
we
don't
know
but
under
the
statute,
and
the
statute
was
designed
to
prevent
such
a
situation
by
--
first
of
all,
all
we
have
to
show
is
that
he
did
make
a
prior
statement,
made
notes
which
are
irrelevant
to
his
testimony.
we
asked
for
a
production
of
those
notes.
then
the
government
must
take
affirmative
action
and
say
the
notes
are
not
relevant
to
what
the
witness
has
testified
to.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
--
under
the
literal
language
of
(b),
it
is
our
position
that
the
notes
of
the
agent
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
absolutely,
and
the
fact
that
he
referred
to
them
and
refreshed
his
recollection
is
a
further
indication
that
he
did
adopt
them
and
approved
them
as
being
his
own.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
the
fact
remains
that
he
did
refresh
his
recollection.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
refreshing
of
the
recollection?
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
as
far
as
we
know
they
were
never
in
court.
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
sure.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
was
not
and
it's
our
position
that
the
defendant
did
everything
that
he
was
required
to
do
either
under
the
statute
or
under
the
jencks
case.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
only
by
the
fact
that
the
agent
said
that
he
had
refreshed
his
recollection
from
the
notes
before
coming
to
testify.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
he
was
a
narcotics
agent.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes
and
i
think
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
were
in
the
possession
of
an
agent
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
--
of
the
united
states,
it
would
be
deemed
to
be
within
the
possession
of
the
united
states.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
do
not
know,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
they're
not
in
the
record.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
none.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
there's
absolutely
no
way
to
know.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
contend
that
i
think
it's
obvious
from
the
record
that
the
agent
rudd
as
he
was
conducting
his
investigation
was
making
notes
as
to
the
events
as
they
transpired
as
to
what
he
saw,
what
he
found,
what
the
witnesses
told
him.
and
that
is
the
type
of
note
that
we
are
seeking
and
of
course
that
is
the
type
of
note
which
would
be
valuable
to
the
case
and
--
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
--
we
could
say
that.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
don't
believe
we
could
say
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
said
that
he
had
refreshed
his
recollection
from
the
notes
before
coming
to
testify.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
he
did
not
shut
it
off.
it's
still
our
position
that
the
only
thing
that
the
defendant
has
to
do
is
request
production
of
a
statement
of
the
witness.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
then
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
--
within
the
literal
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
is.
a
written
statement
made
by
the
witness,
in
making
notes,
the
notes
are
written,
signed
or
otherwise
adopted
by
him.
the
fact
that
the
witness
referred
to
the
notes
to
refresh
his
recollection,
i
believe
is
certainly
an
adoption
and
approval
by
him
of
those
particular
notes.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
where
you
are
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
no,
palermo,
i'd
like
to
emphasize,
does
not
involve
this
situation
at
all.
and
palermo,
a
government
witness
was
on
the
stand.
what
was
requested
was
the
statement
which
that
particular
government
witness
had
given
to
a
government
agent.
and
this
court
decided
it
was
not
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
because
it
was
a
summary,
could
not
be
barely
attributed
to
the
witness,
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
impeach
him
with
someone
else's
statement.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
government
agent
had
said
that
he
made
the
notes
during
the
course
of
his
investigation.
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
do
not
limit
--
i
say
we're
entitled
to
the
entire
notes
of
the
agent
as
far
they
relate
to
anything
that
he
has
testified
to,
and
i
do
not
limit
it
solely
to
his
testimony
as
to
his
conversations
with
dr.
needelman.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
as
far
as
the
--
along
that
line
going
to
jencks
case
itself,
the
action
of
the
defense
counsel
in
that
case
was
a
request
that
the
trial
judge
examined
the
particular
statement
involved
to
see
if
they
could
be
produced
for
his
inspection,
and
that
was
all
that
he
did.
now,
i
think
that
just
so
under
the
same
reasoning
of
the
jencks
case,
that's
all
that's
necessary
to
be
shown
is
that
the
witness
has
made
a
prior
statement
or
prior
notes
relevant
to
his
present
testimony.
once
that
is
done,
then
he
has
established
the
basis
for
the
production
of
the
notes,
under
the
statute,
under
the
jencks
case
itself.
the
next
move
is
then
up
to
the
government
to
protect
itself
by
asking
the
trial
court
to
examine
the
notes
and
to
excise
any
irrelevant
portions
before
they
are
delivered
to
the
defendant.
now,
proceeding
to
the
next
question
as
to
the
effect
of
the
goldman
case
and
the
effect
to
the
jencks
case
upon
the
goldman
case,
first
of
all
we
noted
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
deciding
this
case,
decided
first
of
all
that
the
notes
were
not
within
the
scope
of
the
statute,
because
as
the
fifth
circuit
said,
the
statute
relates
to
formal
statements,
and
statements
which
would
be
admissible
in
evidence.
now,
this
court
and
palermo
discarded
both
grounds,
and
said
that
the
particular
statements,
that
formality
was
not
an
issue
in
determining
the
producbility
of
the
notes
and
the
fact
that
they
would
not
be
admissible
in
evidence
was
also
not
a
fact
that
could
be
considered.
so
the
basis
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
ruling
that
the
notes
were
not
within
the
statute
did
not
conform
with
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
palermo.
the
fifth
circuit
then
proceeded
to
say
that
the
rule
of
goldman
was
not
overruled
by
jencks
and
that
the
trial
court
had
the
discretion
to
deny
the
request
for
the
notes
even
though
the
witness
had
refreshed
his
recollection
from
the
notes
before
coming
to
testify.
now,
in
goldman,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
the
basis
for
the
request
of
the
contemporary
notes
of
the
agents.
i
think
that
in
that
case
as
i
read
it,
the
basis
of
the
request
was
founded
solely
upon
the
assumption
that
because
the
agent
had
refreshed
his
recollection
with
the
notes,
that
they
should
be
produced.
in
the
jencks
case,
the
basis
for
the
production
of
the
statements
of
the
witness
was
the
fact
that
the
witness
at
a
time
when
his
memory
was
precious
had
made
a
statement,
a
record
of
the
events
which
transpired,
that
the
value
of
such
a
contemporaneous
statement
to
the
defense
in
impeaching
the
witness
could
not
be
overestimating.
the
fact
that
the
witness
had
already
testified
relieved
any
qualms
the
court
may
feel
as
far
as
secrecy
of
government
reports
and
investigative
reports
are
concerned.
so,
that
even
though
the
witness
may
not
have
referred
to
his
report
before
coming
to
trial
or
had
not
referred
to
his
report
while
he
was
in
the
courtroom.
that
fact
would
not
prevent
the
production
of
the
prior
statement
of
the
witness.
so
to
that
extent,
i
say
that
jencks
did
overrule
goldman.
to
make
myself
perhaps
a
little
clearer,
we
say
that
if
a
witness
has
made
a
prior
statement
as
to
an
event
about
which
he
is
now
testifying,
if
the
defense
has
that
prior
statement
available
to
him,
he
has
a
weapon
at
his
command
for
impeaching
the
present
testimony
of
that
witness.
i
think
the
basis
for
the
ruling
in
the
jencks
case
is
that
it's
only
fair
that
those
prior
statements
be
afforded
to
him.
goldman,
perhaps
still
has
some
vitality
if
the
witness
is
refreshing
his
recollection
from
statements
which
are
not
his
own.
he
is
referring
to
some
photograph,
or
some
report
of
someone
else.
then
perhaps
the
trial
court
does
have
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
materials
used
for
refreshing
recollection
should
be
produced.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
--
i
--
my
position
first
of
all
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
contemporaneous
notes
of
the
agent
are
covered
by
the
specific
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
--
language
of
the
statute.
i
say
secondly
that
if
you
interpret
the
statute
as
relating
solely
to
reports
of
witnesses
given
to
government
agents
that
the
principles
of
jencks
would
require
the
production
of
the
contemporaneous
notes
of
a
government
agent.
and
for
the
very
the
same
reason,
that
the
reports
were
required
to
be
produced
in
jencks.
that
is
the
fact
that
the
agent
has
made
at
a
time
when
his
memory
was
fresh
a
recordation
of
the
event
by
which
he
is
now
testifying.
and
since
he
has
testified,
there's
no
basis
for
any
evidentiary
privilege
to
be
claimed
by
the
government.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes.
if
--
i
still
say
--
i'd
still
have
to
say
--
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
one
point
about
the
question
of
harmless
error.
this
--
this
court
in
the
rosenberg
case
decided
last
term,
decided
that
even
though
the
trial
court
was
in
error
in
not
requiring
a
production
under
the
statute
of
a
particular
document
that
it
would
be
characterized
as
harmless
error
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
same
information
contained
in
the
documents
sought
to
be
produced
was
already
possessed
by
defense
counsel.
that
can
not
be
said
in
this
present
case
because
we
do
not
have
the
notes
before
us,
we
do
not
know
what
was
in
the
notes,
we
do
not
know
if
the
notes
conform
with
the
case
reports,
and
we
do
not
know
if
they
conform
with
the
testimony
of
the
agent
rudd.
now,
the
case
of
holmes
versus
united
states
in
the
fourth
circuit
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
i'm
pleased
to
say
it
takes
the
same
position
as
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
that
the
notes,
reports
and
memoranda
of
a
government
agent
are
within
the
literal
meaning,
literal
wording
of
the
statute,
18
u.s.c.section
3500.
it
goes
further
and
says
that
since
the
notes
were
not
preserved
in
the
record
that
the
court
had
not
examined
the
notes,
could
not
say
as
this
court
did
in
rosenberg
that
the
defense
was
already
possessed
in
the
same
information
which
they
would've
received
at
the
document
they
produced.
therefore,
they
could
not
characterize
the
error
as
harmless
and
reverse
the
case.
a
similar
case
of
bradford
versus
united
states,
the
ninth
circuit
involved
the
contemporaneous
notes
of
an
agent.
the
court
looked
at
the
notes,
but
did
not
preserve
the
notes
in
the
record,
handed
them
back
to
the
agent.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
applying
the
jencks
case
said
that
is
was
error
not
to
require
the
production
of
those
notes
because
they
were
shown
to
be
relevant
to
the
testimony
given
by
the
agent.
and
they
could
not
say
that
it
was
harmless
error
because
again,
the
notes
had
not
been
preserved
in
the
record,
they
could
not
look
at
them
and
say
that
defense
counsel
was
already
possessed
of
the
information
wich
he
would
have
received.
so
our
position
just
in
a
nutshell
is,
an
agent
has
made
a
prior
statement,
a
prior
record
of
an
event
which
has
transpired
and
has
now
become
very
important
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
party
being
prosecuted.
the
agent
has
testified.
there's
no
further
reason
for
the
government
to
assert
that
such
prior
statement
of
that
agent
should
not
be
produced.
if
it
is
produced,
it
is
relevant
to
his
testimony.
the
value
to
the
defense
cannot
be
overestimating,
particularly
if
that
prior
statement
does
not
now
conform
to
his
present
testimony.
a
simple
justice,
i
think
would
require
that
the
document
be
made
available
to
the
defense.
if
it's
the
same
as
the
agent's
testimony,
no
harm
is
done
to
the
government.
if
it's
different
then
we
do
have
the
further
step
in
ascertaining
the
truth
of
what
actually
occurred
at
the
time
that
the
agent
made
that
record.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
yes,
the
holmes
case
refers
to
them
as
the
reports
and
memoranda
of
the
agent.
the
bradford
case
refers
to
them
as
the
notes
of
the
agent.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
it
might.
yes,
sir.
but
in
our
view,
the
fact
of
communication
is
of
no
importance
whatsoever
unless
the
witness
is
someone
other
than
the
government
agent
who
has
communicated
a
statement
to
the
government
agent,
and
it
is
now
in
the
possession
of
the
government.
the
main
point
is
that
this
government
agent,
at
a
time
when
his
memory
was
fresh,
made
a
record
of
the
events
as
they
transpired.
that
is
the
important
thing.
if
he
just
stuck
it
in
his
pocket,
never
looked
at
it
again
until
the
time
of
trial,
it's
just
as
important
to
the
defense
to
have
that
statement
to
show
that
his
present
testimony
does
not
conform
to
the
report
that
he
made
when
his
memory
was
fresh.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
holmes
case
relied
upon
the
literal
provisions.
the
holmes
case
also
pointed
out
that
this
court
in
the
palermo
case
did
--
was
not
confronted
with
a
situation
involving
the
notes
of
the
agent,
where
the
agent
is
himself
the
witness.
under
the
bradford
case,
they
did
mention
the
palermo
case
and
the
statute.
however,
they
decided
it
upon
the
basis
of
the
jencks
case
rather
than
the
statute,
and
noted
that
when
it
went
back
for
trial
that
the
procedures
prescribed
by
the
statute
would
be
followed.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
the
record
does
not
show
it,
no,
sir.
i
will
--
i'd
like
to
emphasize
again
to
the
court
that
even
in
the
trial
judge's
opinion,
it
was
a
very
slender
case.
mr.
herbert
a.
warren,
jr.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
