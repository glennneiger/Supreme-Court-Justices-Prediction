justice
potter
stewart
why
did
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
conceded
or
--
that
the
--
these
notes
were
in
the
possession
of
the
government
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
because
under
the
statute,
under
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute,
can
they
--
in
order
to
qualify,
they
must
be
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
his
possession.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
exactly
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
at
the
time
the
demand
is
made
is
--
would
be
the
relevant
time,
will
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
one
other
question.
where
--
where
are
the
notes
now?
they've
been
destroyed
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
--
they're
not
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
in
anyway
or
even
as
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
none.
so
there's
no
way
to
know
unless
the
government
tell
us.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
fourth
circuit
case
and
the
ninth
circuit
case,
holmes
and
bradley,
are
the
names
right?
justice
potter
stewart
where
the
--
where
the
so
called
statement
of
the
same
nature
as
those
involved
here,
memoranda
or
memorandum
written
presumably
for
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
writers
on
that
--
they
alone?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
where
the
report
would
--
might
imply
that
this
was
something
to
be
communicated,
be
reported
to
somebody
else,
might
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
two
--
those
two
courts
of
appeals
that
rely
on
the
--
on
the
literal
provisions
of
a
35
--
section
3500
(b)?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
davis,
this
motion
that
was
denied
as
you
pointed
out,
in
page
93
of
the
record,
can

all

is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart

the
motion,
the
one
appear
on
the
page
8
of
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
one
on
page
8.
justice
potter
stewart
prior
to
the
action.
justice
potter
stewart
and?
justice
potter
stewart
of
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
now,
do
we
know
of
what
the
motion
was
that
was
denied
on
page
93?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
93.
justice
potter
stewart
the
motion
itself
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
an
excerpt
only
from
that
that
appears
at
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
printed
record
beginning
on
page
138?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
now,
that
--
that
motion
which
appears
on
page
8
is
not
the
one
that
was
later
already
denied
by
--
page
193,
whatever
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i
don't
understood
yesterday
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
it
that
this
motion,
this
written
formal
motion
appearing
on
page
8
in
the
top
of
page
9
of
the
--
of
the
record
was
denied
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that
it's
--
there's
no
claim
of
error
in
the
denial
of
this
particular
motion.
am
i
mistaken
about
this?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
on
page
8
you're
talking
about
the
court,
on
the
top
of
page
8?
