mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
has
said,
the
only
question
which
is
before
the
court
is
whether
petitioner
was
entitled
to
receive
the
notes
of
the
narcotic
agent
rudd,
who
testified
as
one
of
the
government's
witness.
i
would
like
to
summarize
what
the
government's
position
is
because
i
think
that
though
counsel
has
implicitly
accepted
it
on
argument
today,
his
briefs
had
gone
more
far
field.
our
position
is
that
a
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
receive
the
un-communicated
personal
notes
of
a
government
agent
testifying
as
a
government
witness.
we
do
not
take
the
position,
which
we
think
was
true
in
both
the
bradford
at
least
just
a
part
of
the
materials,
and
certainly
wholly
in
the
holmes
case
that
a
report
made
by
an
agent
to
his
superiors
or
to
other
agents
of
the
government
such
as
the
case
report
which
was
produced
in
this
case,
is
not
producible
because
it
is
the
product
of
a
--
of
a
government
agent's
position.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
because
we
would
say
then
that
by
handing
them
over,
i
think
not
for
safe
keeping,
but
for
examination,
he
was
in
--
he
was
making
a
report
to
another
government
agent.
he
was
--
he
was
telling
the
government
agent,
“here
is
something
that
i've
discovered,
i
want
you
to
note
that.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
in
the
--
in
the
department's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
certain
whether
--
if
they
will
put
them
in
--
in
department's
files,
it
might
be
because
then
they
would
be
used
by
people
including
the
united
states
attorney
in
preparing
for
the
case
and
other
government
officials.
but
here
we
think,
we
have
a
case
which
does
not
--
go
to
that
point.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
i
--
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
when
--
when
--
i
--
i
was
trying
to
develop
that
either
today
or
tomorrow,
because
we
think
there's
a
great
distinction
as
i
will
to
try
to
point
out
that
when
a
man
writes
something
for
himself,
which
he
might
just
right
down,
one
little
jotting
which
reveals
to
him
a
whole
mass
of
material
because
he's
only
talking
to
himself,
as
justice
frankfurter
indicated.
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
when
he's
writing
for
somebody
else.
when
he
leaves
the
private
world
that
is
in
--
own
internal
memory
and
so
on,
and
he
has
to
communicate
to
other
people.
but
when
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
and
our
--
and
our
point
on
that
is,
that
it
was
open
to
the
defense
counsel
to
ask
many
more
question
of
--
of
the
agent,
that
he
--
than
he
did
ask.
and
to
ask
for
in
camera
inspection
which
he
did
not
ask.
now,
i
will
say
this
to
the
court
that
we
would
not
make
an
argument
based
on
the
fact
that
these
notes
were
un-communicated
personal
notes
if
we
knew
that
they
had
been
communicated
to
the
government.
we
had
made
an
inquiry.
we
had
been
assured
by
the
agent
that
these
notes
were
retained
in
his
personal
possession,
given
to
no
other
person
in
the
narcotics
bureau,
or
to
the
united
states
attorney
or
his
assistant.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
haven't,
your
honor.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
the
court
would
have
been
entitled
to
--
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
that
he
would
have
first
had
to
ask
questions
about,
whether
these
notes
were
communicated
to
other
people.
what
kind
of
notes
they
were.
how
were
they
made?
what
do
they
deal
with?
were
they
made
on
the
run?
were
they
elaborate
notes,
or
were
they
just
mere
fragmentary
jottings
and
so
forth.
were
they
communicated
to
anybody
else?
and
whose
custody
had
then
been
kept?
these
are
all
questions
which
counsel
could
have
asked
with
--
without
knowing
anything
more
about
these
notes
than
the
members
of
the
court,
know
now.
and
then
if
a
proper
foundation
had
been
laid,
as
a
result
of
these
questions
and
he
had
then
asked
the
court
to
--
to
inspect
the
notes
in
camera,
depending
upon
the
result
of
the
--
of
the
agent's
answers,
the
court
would
have
or
would
not
have
granted
inspection.
i
mean
it
would
not
have
--
would
or
would
not
have
taken
them
into
his
own
bosom
to
see
whether
they
should
be
made
available
to
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
we
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
they
were
other
notes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
they
were
--
he
wasn't
--
he
didn't
say
from
his
notes,
i
think
they
were
the
proscriptions
themselves
that
he
wanted
to.
the
only
thing
that
appears
about
the
notes,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
on
the
page
88,
the
lines
which
were
read
by
--
by
defense,
by
petitioner's
counsel.
that's
--
that
and
the
motion
which
was
made
and
denied
on
the
page
93
are
the
only
foundation
or
the
only
effort
made
by
the
defense
counsel
in
this
case
to
find
out
what
the
notes
were
about,
what
they
dealt
with,
what
kind
they
were,
whether
they
were
a
narrative
statement,
whether
they
were
just
jottings,
whether
they
were
keywords
like
yesterday
that
--
that
had
one
word
might
reveal
to
some
people.
people
differ
in
their
personalities
and
in
their
--
their
note-taking
habits.
one
word
reveals
a
whole
lot
to
somebody
and
--
and
other
people
are
very
much
more
careful,
or
--
or
shall
i
say
more
(inaudible).
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
where
--
where
is
that
mr.
chief
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
the
report
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
reference
was
to
the
case
report
which
is
a
22-page,
single-space
report
which
was
made
available
to
the
defense
attorney.
it's
22
pages
long,
it's
a
very
elaborate
document,
it
is
on
file
in
the
--
in
the
clerk's
office.
we
have
reprinted
in
the
--
in
the
record
just
the
portion,
beginning
at
page
138
just
the
portion
of
that
case
before
it
that
summarizes
the
anticipated
testimony
of
agent
rudd
himself.
the
preceding
portions
of
the
--
of
the
report
go
at
great
length
into
the
various
exhibits
that
--
that
were
appended
to
the
report,
the
type
of
the
documents
that
the
agent
had
taken
or
it
examined.
and
then
he
--
he
then
goes
on
and
summarizes
at
great
length,
the
--
the
testimony
of
the
various
witnesses
not
only
himself,
all
the
other
witnesses,
whom
he
expected
that
the
united
states
could
call
at
the
trial.
and
he
includes
his
own
anticipated
testimony.
it
goes
beginning
at
--
at
the
top
part
of
page
138,
it
goes
all
the
way
to
page
146
which
is
a
summary
or
a
statement
of
what
agent
rudd
would
himself
testify
to
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
agent
himself.
this
is
the
agent's
report
which
was
made
available
to
the
defense
counsel,
and
as
counsel
has
said,
it
wasn't
in
our
view,
excuse
me,
by
cross-examination
by
the
defense.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
that's
a
motion
before
trial.
page
8
is
the
--
is
a
motion
which
was
made
before
trial
in
this
case,
on
the
--
on
this.
you
see,
first,
there
was
a
trial
on
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
in
that
which
would
--
led
to
a
mistrial.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
then
there
was
a
later
substantive
indictment
which
was
consolidated
with
the
conspiracy
indictment
for
retrial.
this
motion
was
made
prior
to
that
retrial
on
the
conspiracy
indictment
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
page
8.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
there
is
no
question,
before
the
court
as
to
that
the
propriety
of
the
denial
of
that
motion
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
which
was
before
a
trial.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
know
nothing
more.
we
know
nothing
more
than
--
than
appears
in
the
record.
and
before
the
close
of
the
day,
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
the
view
of
the
government,
it
is
incumbent
on
the
defense
and
on
the
appellant
and
on
the
petitioner
in
this
--
in
this
court
to
--
to
present
these
issues
in
a
way
in
which
they
can
be
decided
either
by
the
trial
court
or
the
appellate
court.
that
has
been
the
rule
which
has
been
followed
i
think
since
the
beginning
of
appellate
proceedings
that
the
party
who
is
the
moving
party,
the
party
who
wants
to
attain
--
obtain
some
evidence
or
the
party
who
was
the
appealing
party.
you
seek
some
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
all
there
is
in
the
--
in
the
record.
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr
justice,
the
--
this
print,
is
based
upon
a
mimeograph
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
based
upon
the
reporter's
testimony
of
this
trial.
and
that's
all
we
have.
the
word
denial
for
the
--
of
motion
for
production
notes,
was
i
think
inserted
by
the
clerk
of
this
court
at
the
printing.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
was
inserted
by
the
clerk
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
not,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there's
nothing
except
what
you
see
here.
therefore
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
a
short
recess
was
taking
place.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this
is
all
there
is.
this
is
the
(voice

--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
just
to
--
just
the
--
the
line,
denial
of
motion
for
production.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
next
sentence
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
next
sentence
of
the
court,
“i
will
deny
the
request
for
the
notes.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
--
there
is
nothing,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we'll
admit,
it
was
apparently
made
off
the
record,
not
taken
down
by
the
recorder,
either
in
chambers
or
without
the
jury
being
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
the
next

mr.

at
the
bottom
that
the
motion
for
production
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
inspection.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
i
--
i
yes,
mr.
justice,
the
headline
was
just
considered.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
believe
not.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
some
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
for
the
--
for
these
subdivisions.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
don't
have
the
stenograph
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
have
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
the
reason
i
say
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
reason
i
say
that
i
think
the
clerk
put
in
that
catch
line
is
that
on
saturday,
i
came
up
and
looked
at
the
original
record
and
that
is
included
in
pencil
in
the
--
in
the
--
that
phrase
“denial
of
motion
is
included”
in
pencil
and
in
the
other--
in
the
court's
copies
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
presume
so,
but
i
presume
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it's
impossible
to
have
that
because
i
think
that
what
you
have
is
the
full
stenographic
print.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
was
not
recorded
by
the
stenographer.
i
think
there
was
not
just
an
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
an
omission.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
nothing
and
--
and
the
rule
of
this
court
has
always
been
and
the
rule
of
all
other
courts,
as
far
as
i
know.
that
it
is
incumbent
on
the
party
who
--
who
wishes
to
obtain
evidence
to
lay
the
foundation,
make
sure
that
the
--
the
record
reveals
his
position
and
the
--
and
--
and
to
see
that
it
gets
into
the
record
for
appellate
proceedings.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
that
was
not
done.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
and
in
fact
--
in
--
in
a
case
called
palmer
against
hoffman
in
this
court
in
318
u.s.
which
was
an
earlier
case
involving
production
of
reports
not
in
that
case
to
the
government
but
to
the
other
side's
counsel.
the
court
held
in
the
second
part
of
its
opinion
318
u.s.
at
page
116
that
the
petitioner
who
had
not
got
into
the
record
the
document
that
he
claimed
should
have
been
a
--
he
should
been
allowed
inspection
of
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
fact
that
--
that
the
court
couldn't
pass
upon
it,
and
that
the
court
couldn't
pass
upon
it,
because
he
had
not
got
it
put
into
the
record.
this
petitioner
did
not
get
--
put
into
the
record
the
note,
or
make
an
effort
to
do
--
do
so.
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
the
bradford
case
to
which
counsel
referred,
the
judge
refused
to
put
it
in
the
record.
he
gave
it
back
to
the
government
agent.
he
said
he
wouldn't
put
into
the
record
and
of
course
if
that
happened,
the
petitioner
has
protected
himself.
he
has
done
what
he
could.
but
this
petitioner
did
not
make
any
effort
to
--
to
have
the
judge
put
--
see
this
document
or
put
it
into
the
record
and
preserve
it
for
the
use
of
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
believe
so,
the
bureau
of
narcotics.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
believe
so,
but
we
are
--
we
have
in
part
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
how
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
believe
not.
there
maybe
internal
working
arrangements.
but
i
do
understand
this,
because
we
made
inquiry
that
personal
notes
of
this
kind
can
be
retained
by
the
agent,
and
need
not
be
sent
on
to
his
superior's
or
his
agents.
and
as
i
said
before,
we
have
been
told
by
this
agent
that
he
did
retain
these
notes.
so
we're
not
arguing
a
false
issue
and
we
talked
saying
that
these
notes
were
privately
retained
and
not
omitted.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
came
from
the
bench
of
the
argument
yesterday.
justice
harlan
asked
if
the
record
revealed
how
long
the
jury
was
out.
on
page
405
of
the
original
record
on
file
with
the
clerk,
it
indicates
the
jury
returned
at
4:26
in
the
afternoon
and
returned
with
a
verdict
at
6:06.
so
they
were
out
about
an
hour
and
40
minutes.
some
reference
has
been
made
to
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
before
he
submitted
the
substantive
counts
to
the
jury
refer
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
very
slender
case.
he
did
say
that.
he
said,
“off-hand,
i
think
this
is
a
very
slender
case.”
after
the
verdict
was
returned,
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
made
as
to
all
15
counts.
he
granted
it
as
to
five,
but
did
not
grant
it
as
to
the
10,
which
still
remain
in
the
case.
the
issue
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
brought
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
thoroughly
reviewed
there
as
the
opinion
reveals.
it
has
not
been
brought
to
the
court.
i
would
also
say
on
the
point
that
the
full
record
contains
somewhat
more
evidence
than
the
printed
record
here
that
is,
there
is
testimony
of
both
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
and
witnesses
for
the
defense
whose
testimony
is
not
included
in
the
printed
transcript,
but
it
is
included
in
the
original
transcript
on
file
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
about
the
catch
line
with
respect
to
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
production
of
notes
on
page
93
of
the
record.
i
have
ascertained
from
the
clerk
that
that
catch
line
which
is
in
the
capitals
on
page
93
was
inserted
by
the
clerk
of
this
court
in
preparing
the
record
for
printing
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
and
it
is
done
so
that
an
index
can
be
made
up
from
the
beginning
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
the
original
record,
as
i
said
yesterday,
contains
just
what
we
have
here
and
has
no
indication
of
any
deletions
or
elisions.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
motion
itself
does
not
appear
at
all.
and
i
also
referred
yesterday
to
the
case
report
which
was
delivered
to
defense
counsel
at
--
at
his
request.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
does
not
appear
anywhere.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
by
the
stenographer
at
the
trial.
with
respect
to
the
case
report,
a
copy
of
which
is
in
the
original
record
here
in
file.
i
have
the
agent's
own
copy.
this
is
a
carbon
copy
of
the
one
on
file
with
the
--
with
the
court.
and
i
would
--
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
and
then
tell
the
court
a
little
bit
what
it's
about.
it's
23
closely
typed
pages,
single
space.
and
it's
called
“narcotic
case
report”
and
it
goes
on
with
a
narrative
statement
of
the
--
by
the
--
by
the
agent
of
--
of
the
facts
in
the
case
including
a
very
elaborate
description
of
all
the
physical
exhibits,
the
various
prescriptions
and
records
which
he
--
which
he
inspected
and
which
he
took.
and
then
this
elaborate
description
goes
of
--
of
the
physical
records
goes
on
to
page
8.
and
beginning
at
page
8,
and
ending
at
page
23,
there
is
a
narrative
description
of
the
expected
testimony
of
various
government
witnesses,
not
only
the
agent
himself
but
of
all
the
various
government
witnesses
whom
he
thinks
might
appear
at
the
trial.
beginning
with
the
director
of
--
of
the
internal
revenue
in
that
area
to
show
that
dr.
needelman
did
have
a
narcotic
stuff
and
so
forth.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
excerpt
is
that
--
that
portion
of
the
case
report
which
deals
with
the
expected
testimony
of
agent
rudd
himself.
and
what
i
--
i
now
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
expected
testimony
of
a
lot
of
other
people
is
also
included
in
the
original
report
which
was
handed
to
the
defense
counsel.
the
excerpt
here
which
is
printed
in
the
record
and
goes,
i
think,
for
some
eight
pages
in
the
record
is
the
--
is
the
expected
testimony
of
agent
rudd
himself.
in
the
typed
case
report,
it
goes
from
page
17
to
page
23,
so
it
is
a
--
an
extensive
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
certainly,
mr.
justice.
certainly,
the
portion
of
the
case
report
which
refers
to
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses
would
not
be
compellable
with
respect
to
the
testimony
of
agent
rudd.
in
fact,
it
contains
report
of
testimony
of
people
who
were
not
called
as
witnesses
by
the
government
in
the
trial.
this
is
what
the
agent
thought
the
government's
case
could
rest
upon
at
its
maximum.
some
of
these
witnesses
were
not
called
at
the
trial.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
was
an
important
factor
in
the
trial.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
think
it
was
crucial.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
dr.
needelman
did
deny
that
he
had
said
that.
but
there
was,
of
course,
a
lot
of
other
testimony
to
the
effect
that
these
people
were
addicts
and
were
not
treated
in
a
regular
course
of
--
of
practice.
the
facts
have
not
been
fully
stated
before
the
court
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
them
because
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
was
an
important
factor.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
don't
know
if
it
was
crucial
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
but
it
was
important.
certainly,
that's
true.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
you
can't
tell
that
from
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
the
court
doesn't
know
--
doesn't
know
that.
but
i
would
say
this
that
what
the
defense
did
have
was
not
only
this
very
elaborate
case
report,
but
it
also
had
the
prior
testimony
of
agent
rudd
at
the
prior
trial.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
was
a
mistrial.
and
of
course,
it
also
had
the
testimony
of
the
other
agent
waters.
now,
everyone
agreed
that
at
--
at
this
interview
with
dr.
needelman,
the
only
persons
who
were
present
were
agent
rudd
himself,
agent
walters,
both
of
whom
testified
for
the
government,
a
florida
state
agent,
bellinger,
who
was
not
called
but
was
available
and
dr.
needelman
himself.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
report
is
dated
october
31st
because
that
is
the
day
it
was
transmitted.
i
cannot
say
when
it
was
prepared
and
there
was,
of
course,
no
questioning
of
the
--
by
the
defense
of
the
--
of
the
agent
at
the
time
to
bring
this
out.
i
would
doubt
that
a
report
of
this
length
was
all
prepared
only
one
day.
we
also
do
know
that
the
interview
with
dr.
needelman
occurred
on
september
22nd,
so
there
was
a
lapse
of
time.
we
also
do
not
know
because
there
was
not
sufficient
questioning
as
to
when
the
agent
made
his
notes
because
the
only
information
that
we
have
is
that
short
colloquy
on
page
88
of
the
record,
that
in
the
course
of
this
investigation,
he
made
several
notes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
took
place?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
the
case
report
indicates
that
they
saw
dr.
needelman
early
in
the
afternoon
and
then
they
went
back
to
the
pharmacy.
so
i
can't
say
the
--
it
indicates
exactly
how
long,
but
it
was
apparently
a
period
afternoon
on
the
day
and
then
before
4
o'clock
or
something
or
then.
there
has
--
was
time
for
traveling
going
to
the
pharmacy,
which
wasn't
too
far
away.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
perhaps,
it
would,
but
if
i
can
get
that
basic
part
of
my
--
of
my
--
my
argument,
mr.
justice,
on
--
on
the
jencks
act,
which
i
would
really
like
to
get
to
now,
if
i
may.
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
was
about
to
go
on
with
my
argument.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
was
--
the
first
trial
was
on
a
conspiracy
indictment
only,
mr.
justice,
and
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
--
it
was
not
on
the
substantive
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
it
--
it
might
be.
but
you
see,
it
was
a
conspiracy
between
dr.
needelman
and
the
drugs.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
know
what
occurred
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
think
it
was
before
a
different
judge.
this
conspiracy
indictment
charged
in
this
trial
was
of
course.
you
see,
the
conspiracy
trial
was
tried
--
the
conspiracy
charge
was
tried
again
together
with
the
substantive
counts.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
that
was
before
another
judge.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
might
be
true.
and
of
course,
if
i
may
so,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that's
the
core
of
my
argument
about
the
notes
that
the
man
himself
knows
what
the
notes
are
about
and
other
people
don't.
and
that's
why
they
are
not
properly
usable
in
the
impeachment
process,
which
i
will
try
to
develop.
my
understanding
is,
i
maybe
wrong,
counsel
may
be
able
to
correct
me,
that
--
but
that
the
prior
trial
was
before
a
different
judge.
now,
on
the
--
on
the
problem
of
the
jencks
act,
our
position
is
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
under
the
jencks
act,
that
private
uncommunicated
notes
made
by
a
private
witness,
that
is
a
government
witness
who
is
not
employed
by
the
--
by
the
government.
the
office
assistants
of
dr.
needelman
in
this
case,
who
were
government
witnesses
but
not
employed
by
the
government,
that
if
they
made
private
notes
of
their
conversations
with
dr.
needelman,
which
they
did
not
hand
over
to
the
government,
that
would
not
be
producible
under
the
jencks
act,
that's
clearly
so.
this
would
be
personal
uncommunicated
private
notes
of
those
private
government
witnesses.
our
position
is
that
when
the
witness
involved
is
a
government
agent
and
he
has
notes
which
he
has
made
in
the
course
of
his
investigation
or
--
or
--
what
the
facts
he
has
encountered,
and
he
does
the
same
thing
that
that
private
witness
does,
he
does
not
communicate
the
notes
to
the
government
but
keeps
them
in
himself,
that
he
is
in
the
same
position
and
that
his
notes
are
not
compellable
under
the
jencks
act
as
a
matter
of
right.
we
think
this
follows
both
from
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
from
the
purpose
of
--
of
the
jencks
act
and
from
the
basic
character
of
notes,
which
i
would
want
to
go
into.
the
terms
of
the
statute
has
been
discussed
with
the
court.
and
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
the
only
--
the
--
it's
quite
clear
that
subsection
(a)
and
subsection
(e)
(2)
refer
to
statements
made
to
a
government
agent.
the
whole
basis
of
the
--
of
my
opponent's
position
really
is
subsection
(e)
(1),
which
is
on
page
3
of
our
--
our
brief
and
which
says
that
a
statement
includes
a
written
statement
made
by
said
witness
and
signed
or
otherwise
adopted
or
approved
by
him.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
if
merely
because
the
agent's
notes
were
in
his
own
handwriting,
if
that
were
enough
to
make
them
producible,
congress
would
not
have
said
a
written
statement
made
by
the
witness
and
sign
or
otherwise
adopted
or
approved
by
him.
it
would
have
stop
with
the
statement
of
written
statement
made
by
the
witness
because
everything
in
the
witness'
own
handwriting
would
be
included
in
the
phrase,
a
written
statement
made
by
said
witness,
but
congress
didn't
stop
there
and
went
on
to
say,
“and
sign
or
otherwise
adopted
or
approved
by
him.”
and
we
think
that
this
means
really
that
it's
--
that
the
witness
has
to
acknowledge
responsibility
to
someone
else
for
these
notes.
he
has
to
communicate
them
to
someone
else.
it's
not
enough
that
he
was
writing
a
momento
or
a
--
a
mnemonic
device
to
himself
and
that
--
and
this
fits
in
really
with
the
entire
structure
of
the
jencks
act
because
what
--
as
the
court
well
knows,
what
the
congress
was
dealing
with
and
what
this
court
was
dealing
within
the
jencks
case
were
reports
or
statements
made
by
a
witness
to
the
government,
which
the
government
could
use
in
the
preparation
of
the
case,
which
they
could
use
in
--
in
the
--
in
knowing
what
the
witness
would
testify
to
and
so
forth.
and
the
court
felt
and
the
congress
agreed
that
it
was
--
it
was
consistent
with
the
fair
trial
that
that
kind
of
statement
should
be
made
available
to
the
defense
counsel.
but
neither
the
court
in
the
jencks
case
nor
congress
in
the
jencks
act
were
dealing
with
private
uncommunicated
notes
which
had
been
not
been
used
by
the
government
in
the
preparation
of
the
case
or
even
were
known
to
the
government.
and
--
and
there
is
a
good
reason
--
before
i
go
on
to
the
reason,
i
--
i
would
say
that
we
have
support
in
the
legislative
history,
we
believe,
for
this
possession,
because
not
only
was
there
a
very
explicit
discussion
at
various
points
in
the
legislative
history
that
what
congress
was
dealing
with
was
reports
made
to
an
agent
of
the
government
but
in
the
house
manager
statement
at
the
conference
report,
which
is
the
court
recognized
in
the
palermo
case
last
year,
it's
very
significant
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
act.
the
house
manager
said
that
among
the
changes
agreed
upon
with
the
senate
conferees
was
to
limit
the
types
of
statements
and
reports,
which
come
under
the
provisions
of
the
bill,
the
statements
of
government
witnesses
or
perspective
witnesses
other
than
a
defendant
made
to
an
agent
of
the
government,
and
they
italicized,
they
italicized
in
their
report
the
phrase
“made
to
an
agent
of
the
government.”
so
we
think
that
--
that
they
indicated
very
clearly
that
they
were
talking
about
communicated
information
and
not
something
which
was
kept
within
the
agent's
or
the
witnesses'
own
bosom.
and
congressman
cellar,
who
is
particularly
interested
in
this
and
senator
ommaney
were
explicit
on
this
point
that
its
reports
made
to
an
agent
of
the
government.
one
of
the
reasons
they
were
interested
in
this,
if
i
may
say
by
the
way,
is
that
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
old
rules,
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
reasons,
the
old
rules
such
as
the
rule
of
refreshing
recollection
of
the
goldman
case,
there
were
a
witness
understand
uses
materials
to
refresh
his
recollection.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
that
rule
was
not
cut
off
by
the
jencks
statute.
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
i
--
i
think
that
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
change
--
of
the
omission
of
the
original
exclusive
language
at
subsection
(a)
and
the
change
in
the
conference.
i
think
this
is
the
true
explanation
of
that
change
because
under
the
language,
as
it
was
originally
worded,
that
is
no
reports
would
be
producible
except
as
provided
in
subsection
(b).
and
if
you
had
some
material
or
summary,
for
instance,
which
was
not
producible
under
subsection
(b)
because
it
was
not
a
verbatim
or
substantially
verbatim
statement,
but
it
was
used
by
the
witness
om
the
stand
to
refresh
his
recollection
at
that
time
under
the
literal
terms
of
this
--
of
the
bill
as
it
was
worded
before
the
conference,
that
would
not
have
been
producible
to
the
defense
counsel
because
it
would
have
been
excluded.
and
i
think
that
the
true
--
the
true
reason
for
the
change
in
the
language
to
which
both
you
and
the
majority
of
the
court
adverted
in
the
palermo
case
was
to
continue
the
rule
of
the
goldman
case
from
materials
which
were
used
to
refresh
recollection
because
the
rule,
as
i
hope
to
be
able
to
say
for
few
minutes
later
on,
the
rule
of
the
goldman
case
is
that
where
material
is
used
on
the
stand,
it's
almost
automatically
producible
not
always,
where
it
is
used
off
the
stand
then
it
is
producible
within
the
discretion
of
--
of
the
trial
judge.
and
i
think
that
this
is
what
people
like
congressman
cellar
and
senator
ommaney
were
worried
about
that
the
jencks
act
might
cut
off
an
accepted
rule
which
no
one
was
challenging.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
--
i
would
cast
a
little
warning
on
this
that
in
our
brief,
we
inaccurately
say
that
congressman
cellar
opposed
an
amendment
relating
to
refreshing
recollection,
that
is
not
so.
there
--
the
--
an
original
bill
which
was
just
read
on
the
floor
in
order
to
have
something
else
substituted
contained
this
information.
they
didn't
--
any
of
them
referred
to
that.
but
they
did
refer
generally
to
preexisting
rules
of
law
that
everyone
accepted
that
preexisted
jencks,
i
meant,
or
the
jencks
case.
and
that
no
one
wanted
to
do
away
with
it.
and
they
were
afraid
that
the
jencks
bill,
as
it
was
originally
formulated,
would
do
a
way
with
these
old
rules
of
law.
now,
why
do
i
say
that
--
that
there
is
a
great
difference
between
personal
uncommunicated
notes
and
the
kind
of
statements
which
the
--
the
congress
was
interested
in
--
in
producing
for
the
defendant,
and
which
the
court
in
the
jencks
case
was
interested
in
producing.
we
all
know
that
personal
notes
that
people
make
that
--
that
i
make,
that
members
of
the
court
make,
that
other
people
make
vary
with
the
personality
and
habits
and
everything
else
of
the
individual
note
taker.
some
of
them
can
be
made
on
scratch
pads
and
pieces
of
paper
and
written
upside
down.
some
can
be
--
some
people
use
just
keywords
that
--
that
reveal
to
themselves
because,
of
course,
they
notice
for
their
own
benefit.
a
keyword
may
reveal
a
whole
massive
material
to
the
individual
because
he
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
anybody
else,
it's
for
his
own
benefit
only.
the
one
word,
saw
joe
smith,
as
i'll
try
to
describe
later
may
--
may
recall
the
history
of
the
entire
conversation
with
joe
smith
even
if
he
doesn't
set
out
all
of
the
things
that
joe
smith
said
to
him.
the
court
may
think
that
when
government
agents
either
the
narcotics
bureau
or
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
go
out
that
they
have
a
kind
of
form
for
reports
for
their
notes,
i
mean,
and
they
followed.
that
is
not
so.
they
--
they
follow
their
individual
event
and
some
of
them
--
some
of
the
notes
are,
i
should
imagine,
very
detailed
because
that
is
the
way
the
agent
does
it.
some
other
agents
have
--
have
sketching
notes,
fragmentary
ones
using
keywords
just
to
jot
their
own
memory.
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
gradations
and
permutations
and
--
and
combinations.
it
can
--
it
can
depend
upon
the
situation.
if
an
agent
is
standing
up
at
a
place
talking
to
somebody,
he
can't
write
something
very
adequately
in
his
--
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
on
a
small
card
or
a
piece
of
paper.
he
may
then
go
back
to
the
office
and
write
it
up
more
fully.
or,
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
is
interviewing
a
man
in
the
office
and
the
man
gives
him
a
desk
to
sit
down
at,
he
may
take
fuller
notes.
it
may
all
depend
upon
the
situation,
the
needs
of
the
moment,
the
time
at
his
disposal
and
so
forth.
now,
the
general
practice,
as
i
understand
it,
both
of
the
narcotics
bureau
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
is
that
these
notes
are
--
are
sources
from
which
the
agent
then
uses
to
continue
his
investigation
and
to
write
a
more
formal
kind
of
report
such
a
case
report,
which
was
written
in
this
case,
and
which
was
transmitted
to
the
government
for
use
in
the
prosecution
and
--
and
to
the
defense
counsel.
there
is
a
whole
world
of
difference
between
the
things
that
one
writes
for
oneself
because
you
only
have
to
worry
about
yourself
and
you
know
your
--
you
know
your
own
memory,
and
you
know
how
one
word
may
reveal
something
to
you.
there's
a
whole
world
of
difference
between
that.
and
when
you
want
to
communicate
it
to
somebody
else
and
have
the
other
person
know
what
you
are
talking
about.
let
me
try
to
give
an
example
to
the
court.
suppose
the
note
said,
“i
saw
joe
smith,
i
saw
joe
smith.”
and
the
agent
got
on
the
stand
and
he
testified
that
he
saw
joe
smith
at
a
certain
time,
certain
place.
and
he
--
joe
smith
told
him
this
and
he
answered
that
and
so
forth.
and
suppose
this
note
was
used
in
--
for
impeachment
purposes
and
the
--
the
defense
counsel
would
say,
“well,
you
only
wrote
you
saw
joe
smith.”
and
the
witness
would
say,
“but
that's
my
practice.
the
words
saw
joe
smith
will
recall
to
my
mind
the
entire
conversation
i
had
with
joe
smith.
that's
always
been
my
practice.”
and
the
defense
counsel
says,
“well,
how
do
you
know
it's
your
practice?
it
just
says
you
saw
joe
smith
here.
it
doesn't
say
that
--
what
he
said
to
you
and
what
you
said
to
him
or
anything
else.
how
do
you
know
it's
your
practice?”
and
the
--
and
the
witness
says,
“that's
always
been
my
practice.
i
have
that
kind
of
a
memory.”
and
defense
counsel
says,
“can
you
prove
it?
can
you
bring
in
your
other
notes?”
well,
you
will
then
get
into
exactly
the
kind
of
trial
confusion
and
collateral
issues
which
we
think
that
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
in
the
jencks
act.
there
is
a
probable
situation
with
respect
to
the
--
to
summaries
and
other
recordations
which
were
not
substantially
verbatim.
congress
was
afraid
in
the
end
that
material
of
this
kind
which
contained
the
recorder's
selection,
perhaps
the
recorder's
bias,
perhaps
the
recorder's
impressions
or
--
or
suggestions
that
that
was
not
proper
material
for
impeachment
purposes
that
the
only
proper
--
because
it
would
take
too
long
to
--
to,
what
shall
i
say,
strain
out
that
portion
of
this
recorded
summary,
which
was
really
properly
attributable
to
the
witness,
and
that
which
was
not,
which
was
the
--
the
recorder's
infusion.
now,
of
course,
if
men
were
angels,
that
we
were
all
perfect,
juries
and
judges
and
--
and
defense
counsel
and
prosecution,
and
we
will
--
no
one
was
confused
by
--
by
the
things
you
could
spend
days,
try
to
figure
out
precisely
what
was
attributable
to
the
witness
and
what
was
not.
the
congress
decided
and
--
and
the
common
lawyers
has
decided
that
men
are
not
angels
and
there
is
too
great
--
a
chance
of
confusion
and
too
greater
chance
of
collateral
issues
delaying
and
--
and
confusing
both
the
jury
and
the
--
and
the
parties
to
the
trial
to
allow
long
drawn
out
investigations
of
collateral
issues.
and
we
think
the
same
principle
is
applicable
to
--
to
personal
notes
which
can
--
as
i
say,
vary
from
fragmentary
jottings
to
the
kind
of
narrative
notes
that
--
as
i
understand
judge
learned
hand
made
when
he
was
a
--
a
trial
judge
and
which
we're
very
full
and
very
revealing
to
anybody
else.
and
because
you
can't
tell,
you
can't
tell
what
the
notes
are
like
because
a
fragment
--
you
don't
really
know
whether
the
note
is
only
fragmentary
or
not
until
you
really
investigated
and
find
out
what
the
agent's
practice
is
and
what
his
habits
are
and
so
forth.
that,
on
the
whole,
there
is
too
little
to
begin
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
there
are
two
things
i
would
say
about
that,
mr.
justice,
one
is
that
i
think
then
they
would
fall
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
whether
a
statute
is
written
in
broad
terms,
then
it
covers
things
that
--
that
don't
really
fulfill
the
original
purpose,
but
you
have
to
interpret
the
terms
of
the
statute
in
--
in
square
so
that
it
--
whatever
the
terms
the
statute
cover,
you
will
apply.
but
the
second
and
the
more
important
thing
is
that
when
a
man
communicates
his
notes,
he
indicates
that
he
thinks
they're
going
to
be
understood
by
somebody
else.
he's
sending
it
to
another
agent
or
his
superior
with
the
notion
that
they'll
understand
what
this
is
about.
if
he
gets
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
we
asked
the
agent
for
them.
he
--
he
prepared
--
suppose
he
just
prepared
this
report,
do
you
think
that
this
is
an
infinitive
report
compared
to
those
notes?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
other
things,
probably.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
would
indicate
that
he
thought
that
the
other
people
who
are
going
to
pass
upon
this
for
the
government
in
deciding
whether
to
prosecute
and
to
prosecute
would
be
able
to
get
out
of
these
notes
a
full
statement
of
what
was
going
on.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
yes.
but
i
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
fact
--
that
the
fact
that
the
agent
does
transmit
them
brings
in
to
the
case
the
hallmark
of
his
belief
that
they
have
an
objective
quality
and
so
can
be
understood
by
other
people.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
you
don't
know
that
but
we
have
investigated
and
i
can
assure
the
court
to
the
best
of
our
understanding.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
agent
has
said
it
was
not
transmitted.
he
has
written
us
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that
--
that
he
--
he
has
not.
i
would
not
make
the
argument
that
--
that
if
--
if
we
didn't
know
this
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
no
inquiry
was
made
of
the
witness
on
the
stand.
that
could
have
been.
and
that
basically
is
--
is
our
argument
as
to
why
the
jencks
act
doesn't
apply.
and
then,
you
come
to
the
second
question
which
we
think
is
in
the
case
and
that
is,
suppose
the
jencks
act
does
not
apply
and
these
documents,
these
notes
were
not
compellable
as
of
right
under
the
act,
are
they
compellable
or
can
the
judge
compel
them?
because
they
were
used
as
the
agent
said
on
the
stand
to
refresh
his
own
recollection.
now,
the
--
the
goldman
case
in
1942
adopted
for
the
federal
court
the
majority
rule
of
--
or
the
majority
rule
of
the
--
of
the
states
and
federal
courts
up
to
that
time
which
was
that
materials
which
were
used
by
a
witness
not
on
the
stand
but
prior
to
taking
the
stand
to
refresh
his
recollection
were
producible
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
now,
we
do
not
think
that
that
part
of
the
goldman
rule
was
abrogated
by
the
jencks
act
as
to
materials
which
are
used
to
refresh
recollection.
i
try
--
i
try
to
make
my
self
clear,
the
--
the
jencks
act,
as
this
court
held
in
the
palermo
case
last
year,
provides
for
the
automatic
production
of,
what
shall
i
say,
of
--
of
statements
or
reports,
which
are
properly
attributable
to
the
witness.
and
it
provided
that
there
was
no
discretion
in
a
trial
judge
to
require
the
production
of
reports
or
summaries
which
were
not
properly
attributable
to
the
witness.
now,
suppose
you
have
one
of
the
latter
con,
a
summary,
which
is
not
compellable
under
the
jencks
act,
as
interpreted
in
the
palermo
case
and
suppose
the
witness
says
on
the
stand,
“yes.”
suppose
the
witness
on
the
stand
uses
it
to
refresh
his
recollection
even
though
it's
a
summary,
we
do
not
think
that
the
jencks
act
says
that
cannot
be
given
to
the
defense
counsel.
we
think
that
that
portion
of
the
goldman
rule
survives
and
similarly
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
as
i've
indicated,
the
--
the
rule
has
been
that
unless
there
are
very
serious
reasons
against
giving
it,
the
rule
is
where
the
man
uses
it
on
the
stand,
you
give
it
to
him.
now,
you
have
a
similar
summary,
if
you
may
say,
which
the
witness
says,
“yes,
i
used
it
before
i
took
the
stand
to
refresh
my
recollection,”
that's
not,
as
the
palermo
case,
held
compellable
as
of
right
under
the
jencks
act.
but
we
think
that
it
is
still
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
decide
whether
it
should
be
produced.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
the
court
held
in
jencks
that
goldman
was
overruled
to
the
extent
that
it
gave
discretion
to
the
trial
judge
to
require
the
production
of
certain
types
of
documents,
but
then
along
came
the
jencks
act
and
substituted
for
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
to
refresh
his
recollection.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
we
do
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
my
view
--
our
view
is
that
the
goldman
rule
was
not
completely
abrogated
or
overruled
in
the
jencks
case.
and
that
that
portion
of
the
goldman
rule
which
survived
the
jencks
act
was
the
part
which
said
that
where
something
which
is
--
which
is
not
producible
under
the
act,
but
which
is
used
to
refresh
recollection
is
still
producible
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
in
other
words,
we
would
not
say
that
the
jencks
act
and
i
think
the
legislative
history,
though
it
doesn't
bear
this
out
affirmatively
in
its
basic
premises,
bares
out,
as
i
said
before,
the
notion
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
abrogate
the
rule
as
to
refreshing
recollection
either
on
a
stand
or
prior
to
a
stand.
and
so
that
what
--
what
you
--
if
i
can
summarize
and
perhaps
made
myself
a
little
clearer,
if
you
have
materials
that
are
producible
as
of
right
under
the
jencks
act,
they're
producible
whether
or
not
they've
been
used
to
refresh
recollection.
if
you
have
materials
which
are
not
producible
under
the
jencks
act
because
summary
as
held
in
the
palermo
case,
they
are
not
producible
even
in
the
trial
court's
discretion
unless
they
are
used
to
refresh
recollection.
if
they
are
used
to
refresh
recollection,
then
the
trial
judge
has
discretion.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
--
i
would
think
that
you
--
that
you
didn't
overrule
goldman
completely,
and
--
and
if
you
did
i
would
think
that
you
should
reinstate
it
in
--
in
the
needelman
case
because
it's
a
good
rule
and
--
and
that
where
materials
have
been
used
to
refresh
recollection,
the
trial
judge
should
have
discretion.
so
i
come
to
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
--
in
this
case.and
as
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
that
issue
and
said
there
was
not.
and
as
i've
already
indicated,
what
the
defense
counsel
did
get
was
this
voluminous
case
report.
he
had
the
testimony
of
agent
rudd
at
the
prior
trial.
he
had
also
the
testimony
of
agent
waters
at
this
trial,
who
was
also
present.
he
had
the
possibility
of
calling
agent
bellinger
of
florida
state
narcotics
squad,
who
was
the
only
other
person
aside
from
dr.
needelman
present.
we
also
know
that
he
did
not
make
any
effort
to
find
out
what
kind
of
notes
these
were,
what
they
bore
on,
how
extensive
they
were.
and
whether
or
not
that
further
inquiry
by
him
was
relevant
to
the
question
of
what
--
whether
the
jencks
act
required
production
as
of
right,
we
certainly
think
it's
relevant
to
the
issue
of
discretion,
that
is
that
we,
the
government,
are
right.
the
jencks
act
did
not
compel
production.
then,
you
have
the
question
of
the
discretion.
we
certainly
think
that
it's
--
it's
highly
relevant
to
the
issue
of
discretion
that
the
defense
counsel
did
not
seek
to
go
further
as
he
could
have
gone
to
find
out
what
these
notes
were
about
under
what
conditions
they
were
made,
what
the
relation
to
the
case
report
was,
how
fragmentary
they
were,
how
full
they
were.
all
these
things
which
he
could
have
--
have
gone
into
but
he
did.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
some
of
the
--
the
cases
don't
say
it
explicitly
but
they
go
into
the
question
of
--
of
the
reasons
why
the
production
should
be
allowed
or
not.
and
i
would
say
that
most
of
the
cases
did
not
allow
production,
that
is
in
most
of
the
cases,
the
--
the
court
exercise
discretion
against
production
where
the
material
was
not
used
on
the
stand.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
could
have
been
asked
to
look
at,
as
it
has
been
done
in
other
cases.
and
this,
perhaps,
is
an
appropriate
point
to
deal,
as
i
think
i
tried
to
yesterday,
i
will
deal
with
it
more
fully
with
--
with
the
other
cases
which
have
said
that
because
the
materials
is
not
in
the
record,
we
will
not
consider.
there
were
cases,
the
--
the
holmes
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
case
of
bradford
were
cases
where
the
defense
counsel
made
an
effort.
the
judge
said,
“i
want
to
look
at
them.
i'll
hand
them
back.”
well,
of
course,
if
the
defense
counsel
makes
the
effort
and
the
judge
won't
comply,
then
he's
done
all
of
that
he
could.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
the
miller
case
in
the
second
circuit.
that
is
248
f.
2d
163,
where
the
party
stipulated
that
the
challenged
document
should
not
be
included
in
the
record
on
appeal.
on
the
second
circuit,
applying
the
jencks
case,
this
--
not
the
jencks
statute,
he
said,
“it's
the
burden
of
the
defense.”
if
they
think
that
--
that
something
was
prejudicial
--
refusal
to
give
them
something
that's
prejudicial,
they
should
have
stipulated.
it
should
be
admitted
from
the
record.
now,
i
draw
from
that,
the
--
the
general
proposition
that
the
defense
counsel
should
go
as
far
as
he
could
in
protecting
his
record,
and
this,
of
course,
is
a
--
is
a
general
principle
of
anglo-american
law,
rule
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
defense
counsel
could
then
ask.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
took
--
they
took
to
the
appeal
--
the
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
they
took
appeal
on
this
issue.
if
they
thought
that
the
record
did
not
contain
everything
which
had
transpired
of
the
trial,
they
could
have
asked
for
further
record
if
one
was
available.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right.
and
there
was
--
there
would
be
no
objections
of
their
saying
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
it
has
puzzled
me,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
from
my
resolution
of
this,
i
rely
on
the
old
established
principle
that
the
person
who
was
seeking
the
admission
of
evidence
or
production
of
documents
has
the
burden.
then
the
person
who's
appealing
has
the
burden
with
relation
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
person
who's
petitioning
this
court
has
the
burden
when
he
comes
here.
and
my
opponent
is
in
that
--
each
one
of
those
positions.
and
we
think
that
the
court
has
applied
this
in
hoffman
against
palmer
in
318
u.s.,
as
--
as
i
said
yesterday.
we
think
the
court
applied
it
last
year
in
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
case
with
respect
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
can
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
didn't
mean
that
because
it
is
very
difficult.
and
rule
51
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provide
that
it's
the
--
or
the
--
the
duty
of
the
--
of
the
lawyer
to
make
clear
to
the
judge
what
his
--
what
the
lawyer's
position
is
so
the
judge
can
rule
on
it.
all
these
things
together
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
right.
so,
in
our
view,
the
whole
duty
and
obligation
of
showing
an
abusive
discretion
was
not
availed
itself
out
by
the
--
by
the
defense
in
this
--
in
this
case.
there's
one
further
fact
that
i
--
i
want
to
mention
on
the
question
of
discretion,
and
that
is,
that
we
know
from
just
reading
the
record
that
the
--
the
defense
had
the
case
report
available
to
it
which
he
had
only
asked
for
it
at
the
very
end
of
the
examination
of
the
agent.
and
that
it
had
his
--
his
trial
--
his
testimony
at
the
prior
trial.
it
didn't
apparently
make
any
use
of
this
as
far
as
we
can
say.
and
this
also
bears
on
the
question
of
whether
the
request
of
the
notes
here
was
really
a
serious
one.
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion,
i
may
be
wrong,
reading
this
entire
record
that
at
the
trial,
it
had
a
very
small
role.
and
that
when
the
appeal
stage
came,
it
loomed
much
larger
and
that's
the
right
of
the
defense
counsel.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
defense
counsel
can
take
such
a
position
and
--
and
rely
on
their
own
luck
of
--
of
making
a
record
as
--
as
was
done
here.
now,
we've
also
made
the
argument
that
even
if
these
materials
were
producible
either
as
of
right
under
the
jencks
act
or
where
there
was
an
abusive
discretion
by
the
trial
judge
under
the
--
the
portion
of
the
goldman
rule
will
survives
that
--
it
was
harmless
in
this
case
because
of
the
materials
which
the
--
the
defense
counsel
had
his
ability
to
--
to
cross-examine
the
agent
on
the
basis
of
the
case
report
on
the
agent's
prior
testimony,
the
testimony
of
the
other
agent,
agent
waters,
his
ability
to
call
prior
to
state
narcotics
agent
bellinger.
and
the
fact,
as
i
have
just
said,
that
he
made
--
as
far
as
we
can
say,
no
use
of
--
of
these
materials
which
were
available
to
him.
again,
it's
indicating
that
the
--
the
failure
to
receive
these
notes
did
not
play
a
significant
role
at
the
actual
trial
as
far
as
this
record
reveals.
in
closing,
if
i
may,
i
--
i
would
like
to
make
--
summarize
really
two
or
three
points.
and
one
is
that
we
think
that
it's
very
important
that
if
defense
counsel
are
to
claim
failure
to
receive
certain
materials
that
they
have
the
burden
of
making
a
proper
record
so
that
the
appellate
court,
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
can
make
a
proper
disposition
of
that
claim,
that
they
are
the
ones
who
are
asking
for
the
materials
or
the
evidence
and
under
the
traditional
rules,
as
i've
said,
it
is
their
duty,
their
obligation
to
make
the
proper
record,
and
that
they
cannot
rely
on
a
failure
to
make
the
record
on
the
mercy
of
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
of
this
court
really
to
infer
that
a
lot
of
things
happened
which
don't
appear
on
the
record.
and
the
--
the
second
final
statement
i
would
like
to
make
is
about
the
nature
of
these
notes
and
that
as
i
said,
government
agents
are
no
different
from
other
people
but
they
make
fragmentary
notes,
some
of
them.
some
of
them
may
make
full
notes.
some
make
fragmentary
notes,
jottings,
things
to
remind
them
--
them
of
--
of
events
wholly
unimportant
for
other
people
because
the
only
person
they
are
interested
in
at
that
time
was
themselves.
they
just
want
to
remind
themselves.
and
for
a
man
as
reminded
by
one
word,
that's
enough
for
himself.
