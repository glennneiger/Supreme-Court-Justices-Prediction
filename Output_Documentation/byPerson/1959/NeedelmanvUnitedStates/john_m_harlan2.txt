justice
john
m.
harlan
and
now
that
motion
is
not
an
issue
here,
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
admit
--
does
it
appear
that
the
judge
said
they
could
have
the
case
report?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
subsidiary
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
any
request
made
from
the
notes
that
were
denied,
production
was
denied.
any
request
made,
the
judge
to
take
a
look
at
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
if
this
comes
under
the
statute,
you
get
them
automatically.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
if
you
considered
under
the
statute.
if
you
have
to
fit
it
under
the
goldman
rules,
assuming
jencks
doesn't
extend
this
far,
then
you
are
in
the
realm
of
discretion
are
you
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
in
that
event,
the
absence
of
any
request
or
production
after
the
judge
said
he
would
deny
the
motion
becomes
irrelevant
circumstances.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
if
i
get
your
argument
is
that
to
the
extent
that
there,
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to,
the
extent
in
saying
jencks
was
broader
--
the
jencks
ruling
was
broader
than
what
the
statute
undertook
to
do,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
turning
around
the
other
away,
that
the
statute,
congress
undertook
to
deal
with
jencks
only
partially.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
mean,
if
you're
--
if
you're
not
right
on
that,
then
your
position
is,
that
congress
did
not,
in
the
jencks
statute,
deal
with
all
of
jencks.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
long
was
the
jury
out
in
this
case
as
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
record
doesn't
show?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
noticed
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
does
that
appear?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
this
look
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
what
this
looks
like,
maybe
this
is
all
wrong,
particularly
in
view
of
your
statement
that
this
case
was
tried
before
the
same
judge.
it
looks
like
to
me
that
the
motion
on
page
93,
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
93,
following
the
discussion
with
a
sort
of
giving
counsel
an
opportunity
to
put
an
exception
into
the
records
that
really
stem
back
to
the
original
denial
of
these
earlier
motions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
with
one
of
those
off
the
record
discussions
that
the
--
i'd
like
to
have
the
record
show
that
this
motion
was
renewed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
about
what
it
looks
like,
didn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
much
more
than
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
they
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
asking
to
go
off
the
record,
is
it
fancible
to
suppose
in
the
proportion
where
there's
--
93,
that
counsel
said,
“your
honor,
may
the
record
show
that
the
motion
that
i
made
before
trial
for
the
production
of
these
notes
which
you
deny
was
new
to
the
trial
and
is
likewise
denies
the
trial”?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
think
it's
fancible
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
supposing
the
judge
had
said,
“hand
me
these
notes,”
to
the
united
states
attorney
and
he
take
and
look
at
them
and
said
no
motions
denied.
what
would
have
been
your
position
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he'd
still
be
entitled
to
this?
