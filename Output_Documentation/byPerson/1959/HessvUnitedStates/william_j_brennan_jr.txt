so
you
raise
it
with
us
only
the
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cory,
have
you
made
any
comment
on
that
(inaudible)
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
251,
assuming
now
that
the
congress
didn't
(inaudible)
did
that
court,
seeking
re-argument,
think
that
(inaudible)
where
the
right
of
the
party
that
the
defendant
by
the
maritime
law
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
it
said
that
(inaudible)
whatever
the
action
is
that
the
state
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
may
--
may
i
understand
this?
is
the
government's
position
on
this
is
that
the
maritime
tort
or
wrongful
death
act,
the
state
law
is
less
favorable
than
what
has
been
the
general
maritime
law
(inaudible)
survivor
of
the
accident
then
the
less
favorable
standard
may
be
required
to
see
the
claim
of
his
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
state
statute
would
(inaudible)
did
not
embrace
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
seaworthiness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
if
the
individual
survived
the
accident,
he
does
have
a
claim
which
would
have
given
recovery
based
on
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
quite
so,
then
--
then
if
he
couldn't
prove
that
the
state
death
statute
embraced
unseaworthiness,
there
should
be
no
recovery.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
death
statute
imposed
standard
of
absolute
liability,
it
(inaudible)
higher
standard
than
the
general
maritime
standard
likewise
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)to
be
under
this

under
that
is

is

the
injured

decide

justice
william
j.

by
(voice

--
justice
william

that's
because
the
standard
is

is

by
a
higher
standard

(inaudible)
justice

the

conditions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
holding
out
federal
limitation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
precisely
the
argument
in
--
advanced
in
the
dissent
in
tungus
and
rejected
by
the
court,
namely,
the
argument
and
the
dissent
in
tungus
was
that
only
the
remedy
should
be
borrowed
and
the
substantive
law
be
fashioned
according
to
the
general
maritime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
did
my
best
to
get
it
there,
hadn't
i?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
let
me
put
it
this
way.
isn't
the
argument
made
from
the

precisely
the
argument
you're
making
now?

the

william
j.

well,
do
you
think

such

the

didn't
reach
