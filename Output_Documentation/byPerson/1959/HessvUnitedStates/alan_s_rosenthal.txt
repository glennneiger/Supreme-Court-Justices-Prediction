mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
add
one
or
two
facts
to
those
stated
by
mr.
cory
in
order
to
bring
the
entire
factual
situation
in
what
we
regard
as
--
should
be
a
part
of
context.
the
arrangement
between
the
united
states
or
rather
its
project
engineer
and
the
representatives
of
larson
was
that,
when
larson
wished
additional
gates
closed,
it
was
to
advise
the
project
engineer
who
would
in
turn
relay
that
request
to
the
operational
personnel
of
the
dam.
now,
the
--
mr.
cory
points
out
the
larson
representatives
requested
the
closing
of
two
additional
gates.
those
two
gates
were
closed.
there
was
no
other
request.
and
additionally,
the
day
before
the
accident,
the
superintendent
of
the
larson
company
undertook
personally
a
reconnaissance
trip
along
the
area
where
the
sounding
operation
is
where
to
be
undertaken,
to
ascertain
for
himself
whether
or
not,
the
soundings
could
be
taken
safely
with
the
gates
closed,
the
number
of
gates
closed
which
have
been
requested
to
be
closed.
on
the
basis
of
that
reconnaissance
trip,
the
larson
superintendent
decided
for
himself
that
the
operation
would
be
safe
with
the
gates
closed
as
requested.
and
we
think
that
that
forms
the
basis
for
--
the
basis
for
district
court's
alternative
holding
of
this
case
that
the
employers'
liability
act
was
inapplicable
in
terms,
because
the
work
was
from
beginning
to
end,
in
charge,
the
district
court
found,
all
the
independent
contractors
that
all
that
the
united
states
was
interested
in
was
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
general
result.
now,
the
basic
position
of
the
government
here
this
afternoon
is
first,
that
this
is
beyond
any
question,
an
action
on
a
maritime
tort.
second,
that
if
this
were
an
action
between
private
parties,
the
liability
of
the
defendant
would
be
measured
by
the
reasonable
care
standard
of
both
the
maritime
law
and
the
oregon
wrongful
death
act,
which
standard
was
applied
by
the
district
court
here,
rather
than
by
the
strict
standard
of
the
oregon
employers'
liability
law.
and
third,
that
since
the
united
states
is
liable
under
the
tort
act,
only
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
party
would
be
in
like
circumstances,
the
employers'
liability
law
is
similarly
inapplicable
here.
but
we
do
not
understand
the
petitioner
to
challenge
here,
that
if
this
action
were
between
private
parties,
this
suit
would
clearly
be
within
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
the
critical
fact
from
that
standpoint
is,
of
course,
that
the
injurious
force,
in
this
case
the
turbulent
waters
which
caused
the
tug
to
capsize,
came
into
contact
with
and
caused
the
death
of
the
decedent
on
the
--
on
navigable
waters
of
the
state
of
oregon.
now,
we
concede,
of
course,
that
merely
because
this
case
is
within
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
state
law
is
completely
inapplicable.
as
we
note
in
our
brief
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
romero
case
last
year,
there
are
certain
incidents
of
maritime
relationships
to
which
state
laws
maybe
validly
applied.
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
one
particular
aspect
of
the
maritime
relationship,
and
that
aspect
is
the
standards
of
substantive
tort
liability,
which
are
to
be
applied.
and
we
submit,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
as
to
this
area,
this
court
has
never
permitted
state
law
to
determine
substantive
tort
liability
for
an
injury
on
navigable
waters.
now,
we
are
going
through,
of
course,
in
our
brief
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
pardon?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
a
death
case
or
in
a
personal
injury
case.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
tungus,
your
honor,
the
substantive
tort
liability,
the
question
there
was
whether
the
oregon
--
excuse
me,
the
new
jersey
wrongful
death
act
embraced
a
claim
for
seaworthiness,
a
claim
which
is
recognized
by
the
--
the
maritime
law.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
the
tungus
case
or
in
halecki
that
was
decided
with
it,
that
a
state
law
imposing
a
different
standard
of
care
upon
the
defendant
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor.
it
--
i
think
that
what
this
court
held
in
the
tungus
case
was
simply
that
since
you
are
invoking
a
state-created
remedy,
you
must
take
it
subject
to
whatever
conditions
or
limitations
the
state
may
have
imposed.
and
i
wish
to
point
out
in
this
connection
in
--
in
the
halecki
case
where
the
question
--
one
of
the
questions
was
whether
or
not,
the
warranty
of
unseaworthiness
or
warranty
of
seaworthiness
rather,
extended
to
the
--
to
the
victim
in
that
case.
this
court
on
that
question
turned
to
the
federal
cases,
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn
to
the
sieracki
case
in
determining
whether
or
not,
there
had
been
a
breach
of
duty
upon
the
part
of
the
defendant,
that
it
was
a
federal
maritime
law
that
defined
the
scope
of
the
duty
of
the
defendant.
and
that
again,
the
--
the
reference
to
the
state
law
came
in
into
the
context
as
--
you
have
to
enforce
for
state
remedy
as
you
find
it
and
if
the
state
does
impose
conditions
or
limitations
upon
recovery,
for
example,
as
the
question
in
the
scope
by
itself
as
to
whether
the
state
act
was
sufficiently
broad
to
--
to
encompass
a
claim
for
unseaworthiness.
those
questions
are
questions
of
state
law,
but
we
submit
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
--
the
tungus
or
in
halecki
or
in
any
of
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
suggest
that
a
state
wrongful
death
act
maybe
invoked
to
enforce
a
claim
which
would
not
have
been
recognized
in
admiralty.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
--
that
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
is
quite
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
but
our
position
would
be
on
--
on
that
is
this.
that
--
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
this
case
--
this
court
rather
has
always
rejected
endeavors
to
utilize
state
laws
in
determining
of
substantive
tort
liability
which
were
state
laws
which
were
inconsistent
with
the
maritime
law.
now,
in
two
of
the
cases
in
this
chain,
the
precise
question
was
whether
a
state
statute
or
common-law
doctrine
which
imposed
a
different
standard
of
care
from
that
of
the
maritime
law
could
be
applied.
now,
in
the
robins
dry
dock
versus
dahl,
it
was
a
matter
of
the
new
york
labor
law
which
imposed
a
higher
standard
of
care
than
the
reasonable
care
standard
of
the
maritime
law.
and
this
court
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
no
your
honor.
our
position
is
with
respect
to
the
manner
of
substantive
tort
liability
that
the
--
that
the
maritime
law
would
control,
that
the
standard
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
in
--
in
that
instance
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
that
--
that
is
quite
so
in
those
circumstances
but
that
is
only
because
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
it
isn't
because
it's
a
matter
of
a
higher
standard
in
that,
your
honor.
we
are
or
our
suggestion
is
this.
that
in
order
to
invoke
a
state-created
remedy
for
a
maritime
on
a
maritime
tort
that
before
you
get
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
state-created
remedy
applies
or
not,
you
have
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
breach
of
a
duty
imposed
by
the
maritime
law.
but
once
it
has
been
determined
that
there
is
a
breach
of
the
--
the
maritime
law
--
of
the
duty
imposed
by
the
maritime
law,
then
the
question
becomes
whether
the
state
has
created
a
remedy
for
it.
now,
to
the
extent
that
--
that
their
inconsistency
here,
of
course,
all
stems
from
the
fact
that
it
is
still
the
--
the
law
that
admiralty
itself
does
not
recognize
the
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
and
that
you
have
to
import
a
state
law
to
provide
that
remedy.
but
we
suggest
though
that
in
order
to,
again,
in
order
to
invoke
the
state
remedy,
you
first
have
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
was
a
breach
of
a
duty
recognized
by
the
maritime
law.
now,
otherwise,
you
would
have
a
--
a
situation
where
the
--
the
individual
had
he
survived
and
gone
into
a
court
of
admiralty
or
had
invoked
a
remedy
under
the
savings
to
suitors
clause,
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
recovery.
there
would
have
been
no
breach
of
a
maritime
duty.
yet
the
fact
that
he
died
permits
the
state
to
give
him
a
recovery
which
is
in
excess
--
well,
a
recovery
which
he
could
not
have
gotten
under
--
under
the
maritime
law
had
he
lived.
but
we
do
not
think
that
the
importation
into
the
admiralty
and
maritime
area
of
state
wrongful
death
acts
was
intended
to
give
the
survivors
if
the
person
who
dies
greater
rights
than
the
individual
would
have
had
if
he
had
lived.
well,
we
--
similarly,
if
the
--
if
the
court
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
oh,
yes.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
oh,
yes.
yes,
that's
right,
but
our
position
would
be
whether
in
this
case,
whether
this
individual
lived
or
died,
even
mr.
graham
--
even
mr.
graham
survived
that
the
--
the
oregon
employers'
liability
act
would
not
have
been
applicable.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
no.
it
would
have
worked
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it's
a
state
law.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
state
law
is
imposing
a
higher
or
a
lower,
in
the
case
of
a
--
case
of
a
personal
injury
action.
just
last
year
in
kermarec,
this
court
rejected
the
application
of
the
new
york
“gratuitous
licensee”
rule
which
had
a
lower
standard
of
care.
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
where
you're
dealing
with
a
personal
injury
case
as
to
whether
the
standard
of
care
is
higher
or
lower.
but
the
reasonable
care
standard
of
the
maritime
law
controls.
now,
where
you
have
a
wrongful
death,
you
run
into
this
problem
because
you're
invoking
a
state
remedy
and
as
this
court
held
in
--
in
the
skovgaard
case,
you
have
to
take
it
with
the
conditions
or
limitations.
but
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
state
conditions
and
limitations.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
no,
not
a
federal
--
well,
a
federal
limitation
is,
simply,
that
the
act
is
--
that
you
do
not
invoke
the
act
as
in
a
--
with
respect
to
a
maritime
tort
unless
there
was
a
breach
of
a
maritime
duty
that
--
that
we
do
certainly
argue
here.
now,
the
petitioner
places
reliance
here
on
the
local
concern
doctrine
and
the
twilight
zone
doctrine
which
was
involved
in
the
workmen's
compensation
field.
and
we
think
that
these
doctrines
are
clearly
inapplicable
to
the
field
of
tort
liability.
these
doctrines
were
evolved
in
the
workmen's
compensation
field
to
meet
problems
that
were
peculiar
to
workmen's
compensation.
and
certainly,
there
has
been
no
suggestion
by
this
court
in
recent
times
that
either
of
these
doctrines
have
application
to
the
area
of
tort
liability.
now,
last
year,
i
referred
a
moment
ago
to
the
kermarec
case.
now,
mr.
cory
has
stressed
the
fact
that
the
injured
--
the
decedent
in
this
case
was
a
carpenter,
albeit,
working
on
navigable
waters.
in
the
kermarec
case,
the
injured
person
had
no
connection
at
all
with
navigable
waters.
he
was
a
mere
casual
visitor
to
the
ship.
he
was
visiting
a
crew
member
and
he
slipped
and
fell
on
a
stairway.
and
certainly,
in
that
case,
there
was
--
that
if,
in
this
case,
the
local
concern
doctrine
would
apply,
it
certainly
would
have
applied
in
that
case.
and
the
--
the
fact
is
that
the
court
made
no
reference
to
local
concern,
didn't
give
it
any
consideration,
and
we
think
quite
properly
solved.
and
we
think
that
this
is
a
doctrine
which
is
confined
in
its
scope
to
the
--
to
the
area
of
workmen's
compensation.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
again,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
do
not
think
that
this
question
was
before
the
--
the
court
in
tungus.
the
question
in
tungus
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
but
the
question
in
tungus
was,
and
that
we
see
that
the
only
question
that
was
decided
was
whether
or
not
the
new
jersey
wrongful
death
act
embraced
the
--
the
maritime
recognized
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
if
--
to
the
extent
that
your
--
your
honor
in
tungus
argued
for
the
--
the
broad
application
of
maritime
law,
that's
--
that's
right,
but
i'm
not
willing
to
concede
that
the
position
that
we
take
is
in
anyway
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
inconsistent
with
the
holding
in
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
that's
correct.
that
--
that's
correct.
but
we
--
we
still
feel
we
--
that
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
the
holding
in
the
--
the
tungus
case
that
that
was
dealing
again
with
the
matter
of
the
conditions
and
limitations
that
are
imposed
by
the
state
laws.
they're
not
holding
and
the
--
and
the
position
that
we
take
in
--
in
this
court.
but
we
submit,
therefore,
that
if
this
--
this
action
were
between
private
parties
in
an
oregon
court,
in
a
federal
district
court
exercising
diversity
of
jurisdiction
or
in
a
--
on
the
admiralty
side
of
the
district
court,
that
the
oregon
employer
--
employers'
liability
act
would
be
inapplicable.
and
because
that
is
so,
we
think
that
it
follows
that
under
the
--
the
language
of
the
tort
claims
act,
the
act
--
the
liability
of
law
is
similarly
applicable
here.
now,
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
the
use
of
the
term
“place”
in
1346
(b)
was
intended
to
be
as
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
court
in
a
reference,
the
type
of
territory
or
terrain.
his
argument
is
that
the
injury
--
that
the
negligence
occurred
on
land
and
therefore,
it
is
land
law
rather
than
the
maritime
law.
we
think
that
this
argument
is
--
is
without
merit.
we
feel
that
certainly
here,
the
--
the
congress'
reference
to
a
place
was
a
--
was
and
--
was
a
--
that's
a
conflict's
rule
with
the
reference
being
to
a
political
jurisdiction
which,
of
course,
promulgates
laws.
now,
there's
no
such
law
--
there's
no
such
--
there's
no
laws
of
--
of
dams.
the
laws
emanate
from
political
entities.
now,
they're
not
only
states,
they're
also
counties
and
municipalities.
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
congress
may
have
chose
--
may
have
chose
to
refrain
from
the
use
of
the
word
“state”
was
to
encompass
municipal
regulations
or
county
ordinances
of
the
like.
but
there's
certainly
no
suggestion
that
it
was
intended
within
the
confines
of
a
particular
state
to
make
a
selection
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
happened
on
water
in
that
state
or
on
land
in
that
state.
and
eastern
air
lines,
of
course,
was
dealing
with
the
typical
conflict
situation.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
there
was
a
choice
of
the
laws
of
two
states,
virginia
on
the
one
hand
and
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
other
hand.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
problem.
the
entire
transaction
from
beginning
to
end
occurred
within
the
state
of
oregon.
it
is
our
position
that
it
would
be
the
oregon
law
that
would
be
applied
in
this
case
on
these
facts,
if
there
were
private
parties
involved.
now,
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
once
held
albeit
by
way
of
dictum
that
where
a
maritime
tort
is
involved,
it's
a
tort
of
liability
of
the
law.
it's
inapplicable.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
your
honor,
in
a
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
know
of
no
--
of
cases
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
indicating
that
to
the
contrary
in
a
--
another
case
which
is
cited
in
our
--
our
brief,
the
rorvik
case,
which
was
in
99
oregon.
there
was
a
--
a
captain
who
had
been
killed
or
in
this
ship
had
been
killed
when
he
hit
the
--
he'd
been
hit
by
a
piece
of
lumber.
he
was
--
the
captain
was
standing
on
the
wharf.
he
was
hit
by
the
lumber
and
was
thrown
into
the
water.
and
the
state
endeavored
to
invoke,
in
that
case,
the
liability
law.
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
there
held,
yes,
the
liability
law
is
applicable,
but
it's
applicable
because
the
injury
took
place
on
land.
and
therefore,
this
is
not
within
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question
in
--
in
these
circumstances
for
taking
these
two
cases
together.
that
the
oregon
courts
would
regard
as
we
suggest
they
must.
the
oregon
law
applicable
here
to
embrace
the
reasonable
care
standard
of
the
maritime
law.
and
with
respect
to
the
case
of
hahn
versus
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company
upon
which
the
petitioner
relies,
we
think
that
that
is
clearly
inapplicable
here.
the
question
in
that
case
was
whether
the
federal
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
provided
the
exclusive
remedy
in
circumstances
where
the
employee,
one,
was
in
the
twilight
zone
and
two,
the
employer
had
not
elected
to
place
himself
under
the
oregon
state
compensation
act,
which
act
provided
that
if
there
wasn't
election
to
remain
without
its
provisions,
the
employee
was
left
to
--
he
was
provided
with
his
common-law
remedies.
now,
there
was
no
suggestion
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
that
the
employee
was
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
employers'
liability
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
didn't
reach
the
question
as
to
whether
--
assuming
that
the
employee
was
allowed
to
bring
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
standard
of
care
would
be
that
of
the
wrongful
death
act
or
that
of
the
employers'
liability
law.
this
was
because
in
the
view
of
the
oregon
supreme
court,
the
federal
employer
--
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
was
exclusive,
so
we
feel
that
the
--
the
ross
case
lends
no
support
whatsoever
to
--
to
the
petitioner's
position
of
the
--
the
petitioner
here.
finally,
if
the
court
pleases,
we
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
oregon
--
experienced
oregon
district
judge
held
here
that
the
act
is
inapplicable
in
terms
of
the
--
in
terms
of
the
act
imposed
to
obligation
only
upon
persons
having
charged
of
or
responsible
for
the
work
being
performed.
the
district
court
filed
as
a
fact
here
that
the
united
states
was
not
in
charge
of
or
responsible
for
the
work
being
performed
and
we
thought
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
the
court
of
appeals
disposed
of
this
case
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
employers'
liability
act
could
not
be
applicable
if
this
were
an
action
between
private
parties
and
therefore,
it's
inapplicable
here.
but
we
do
think
that
the
--
the
alternative
ground
upon
which
the
district
court
placed
its
decision
was
also
correct.
and
we
think
that
this
--
this
follows
from
the
case
of
warner
versus
synnes
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
we
are
saying
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes.
we're
saying
that
--
we're
using
it
in
the
same
sense,
i
think.
our
argument
is
really
along
the
same
lines
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
that
--
jensen,
but
taking
the
most
recent
case
in
kermarec,
i
think
what
this
--
this
court
was
holding
there,
was
that
in
view
of
--
of
jensen
and
the
principle
of
uniformity
that
the
maritime
standard
of
reasonable
care
governed
rather
than
the
lesser
gratuitous
licensee
standard
of
the
new
york
law.
but
what
it
was
holding
in
effect
was
that
the
new
york
--
that
an
action
between
--
involving
new
york
law
or
based
upon
new
york
law,
nevertheless,
that
the
new
york
courts
could
not
apply
their
gratuitous
licensee
standard.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
--
i
think,
if
your
honors
please
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
well,
as
i
understood
it,
in
the
kermarec
case
in
the
lower
courts,
the
lower
courts
held
that
since
this
accident
occurred
in
the
navigable
waters
in
new
york,
as
to
the
vessel
had
berthed
in
the
new
york
harbor,
that
the
shipowner
was
only
liable
if
he
had
known
of
--
actually
known
of
the
defect
and
had
failed
to
warn
the
--
the
visitor
of
that
defect.
but
that
wasn't
one
of
the
bases
on
which
the
--
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
lost
with
this
application
of
new
york
law.
and
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
held
that
no,
that
the
--
the
court
should
not
have
invoked
that
new
york
standard,
not
only
should
not
have,
could
not,
and
that
the
action
was
governed
by
the
reasonable
care
standard
of
the
maritime
law.
and
that
was
the
question
here
is
whether
the
shipowner
had
--
had
exercised
reasonable
care.
and
so,
our
position
here
is
--
is
right
along,
we
think,
in
line
with
the
--
with
the
holding
of
the
court
in
kermarec,
with
some
of
the
same
basis.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
--
that's
correct,
but
we
suggest
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference
in
--
in
this
area
as
to
whether
it's
a
wrongful
death
or
not.
we
would
suggest
that
certainly,
at
the
time
of
western
fuel
company
versus
garcia
in
this
whole
doctrine
with
respect
to
importing
a
wrongful
death
act
or
state
law
death
act,
to
provide
a
remedy
on
a
maritime
tort
but
it
was
never
thought
that
the
result
of
this
would
be
that
in
using
the
state
act,
the
individual
could
recover
on
a
claim
which
would
not
have
been
recognized
in
admiralty.
and
again,
that
--
on
the
other
side
of
this
was
just
simply
a
matter
here,
but
since
you
are
invoking
a
--
a
state-created
remedy,
that
you
have
to
take
a
remedy
subject
to
whatever
limitations
the
state
has
placed
upon
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
--
point
to
this,
and
that
is
that
this
court
may
recall
in
the
halecki
case,
the
second
circuit,
in
construing
new
jersey
law,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
new
jersey
courts,
if
faced
with
a
seaworthiness
claim
under
a
wrongful
death
act,
would
not
invoke
to
contributory
negligence
doctrine
that
would
be
invoked
if
it
were
with
respect
to
a
non-maritime
tort.
since
the
time
of
the
halecki
case,
the
fourth
circuit
has
come
to
precisely
the
same
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
virginia
wrongful
death
act.
that
the
virginia
wrongful
death
act,
when
being
invoked
on
a
maritime
tort,
the
virginia
courts
would
impose
the
same
conditions
or
--
and
limitations
of
the
maritime
law.
and
this
was
without
any
--
any
--
virginia
decision
points
or
it
well
may
be
that
this
--
this
problem
that
has
arisen
because
of
the
necessity
of
taking
in
the
conditions
of
limitations
will
not
in
practice
prove
as
a
serious
one.
and
there
will
be
in
the
final
analysis
that
under
the
wrongful
death
act,
you
will
have
on
both
sides
of
it,
both
in
terms
of
the
creation
of
liability
and
also
in
terms
of
the
conditions
and
limitations,
the
application
of
the
--
the
maritime
law.
and
i
think
that
that
would
be,
of
course,
a
desirable
result
in
terms
of
the
uniformity
doctrine
which
this
court
has
consistently
applied.
