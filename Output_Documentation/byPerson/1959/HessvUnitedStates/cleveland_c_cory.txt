mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
this
case
will
be
a
welcome
change
from
the
last
case
here.
we
have
a
very
--
a
very
short
record.
we
have
two
briefs
of
40
pages.
we
have
no
conflict
in
fact.
the
only
questions
before
the
court
are
questions
of
law.
now,
this
is
a
federal
tort
claims
act.
it
was
brought
in
the
district
court
of
oregon.
and
after
a
full
trial,
mostly
on
stipulated
facts,
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
case
on
the
merits.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
action
was
brought
to
recover
substantial
$100,000
damages
for
the
wrongful
death
of
the
man
named
graham.
and
on
october
20,
1954,
he
was
employed
as
a
carpenter
by
a
mr.
robert
larson
and
larson
had
a
contract
with
the
united
states
for
the
repair
of
the
baffle-deck
of
one-half
of
the
baffle-deck
of
the
spillway
deck
of
the
bonneville
dam.
your
honors,
you
may
again
see
a
map
here,
the
spillway
dam
on
the
columbia
river
is
right
here,
the
baffle-deck
is
a
concrete
structure
that
takes
the
flow
of
water
which
comes
through
the
gates
down
there,
and
this
--
in
the
period
between
1938
when
the
dam
was
constructed
in
1954
when
this
contract
would
last.
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
deal
of
erosion
of
the
deck
and
of
the
baffles
which
were
constructed
to
dissipate
the
velocity
of
the
water,
these
big
concrete
baffles.
so
mr.
larson
had
this
contract
with
the
united
states
and
graham
was
his
employee.
now,
under
the
contract,
the
contract
contemplated
that
the
operations
of
the
dam
would
be
carried
on
at
all
times
in
the
regular
manner
by
the
corps
of
engineers,
these
employees
of
the
united
states,
and
that
they
were,
of
course,
in
exclusive
and
complete
charge
of
lowering
and
raising
the
gates
of
the
dam.
there
are
18
spillways
all
the
way
down
to
the
washington
side,
number
one
down
to
the
oregon
side,
number
18.
and
they
are
--
these
gates,
which
are
about
50
feet
by
50
feet,
rest
on
a
so-called
“ogee
section”
above
the
deck,
and
they
are
moved
by
big
cranes
that
move
across
the
base
of
the
dam.
now,
your
honors,
the
contractor
contemplated
that
he
was
would
go
in
and
build
a
timber
crib
right
in
this
section
here
at
gate
nine.
and
--
that
then
he
would
complete
all
these
copper
dams
right
around
and
then
he
would
pump
the
water
out
of
this
section
so
that
he
could
expose
the
surface
of
the
baffle-deck
and
proceed
to
do
his
extensive
repair
work.
and
of
course,
he
was
required
by
the
contract
at
all
times
to
consult
with
the
employees
of
united
states.
there
was
a
man
named
caps
(ph)
who
was
in
charge
of
the
operation
of
the
dam.
and
then,
there
was
a
man
named
patrick
leonti
who
was
the
liaison
man.
and
it
was
up
to
larson,
and
he
did
confer
with
mr.
leonti
and
he
told
them
what
he
expected
to
do.
and
this
accident
--
this
very
tragic
accident
in
which
four
men
were
drowned
occurred
when
he
was
just
commencing
his
contract.
now,
what
he
proposed
to
do
and
what
he
told
the
united
states
he
was
going
to
do
was
to
find
out
by
a
sounding
operation
just
how
this
baffle-deck
had
been
eroded
in
this
section
so
that
he
could
construct
a
timber
crib
on
land
and
take
it
out
and
sink
it
and
it
would
be
on
the
right
section
underneath.
and
so
he
told
the
united
states
that
he
wanted
to
take
a
tugboat
and
a
barge
and
go
up
there
and
anchor
or
lash
a
barge
in
by
the
phase
of
the
dam
and
take
these
soundings.
and
in
connection
with
that
--
at
that
--
at
that
time,
the
--
these
gates,
11
to
18
were
closed
and
that
created
a
quiet
pool
in
this
area.
larson
asked
(inaudible)
gates
10
and
11
on
the
day
that
he
was
going
to
--
his
men
were
going
to
do
this
operation.
and
that
was
done.
but
gates
eight,
seven,
six,
five,
four,
three,
two,
one
were
open.
they're
opened
to
a
certain
extent
and
the
evidence
conclusively
shows
that
the
velocity
of
the
water
coming
through
these
gates,
immediately
in
the
stations
to
where
this
operation
was
going
to
be
carried
on
was
about
30
miles
an
hour,
a
tremendous
flow
of
water
coming
through
there.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
well,
in
here,
with
gates
closed,
there
was
no
water
coming
through
here.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
so
that
all
water
were
coming
through
the
gates
that
remained
open.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
well,
all
these
gates
were
open
to
more
or
less
an
extent.
i
think
the
main
velocity
of
water
was
coming
through
with
the
gates
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
well,
i
think
the
--
the
evidence
shows
that
gate
eight,
for
instance,
was
opened
32
inches
and
the
water
was
coming
through
there
at
5700
cubic
feet
per
second.
and
gate
seven
was
opened
55
inches.
and
--
and
the
water
was
coming
through
at
9100
cubic
feet
per
second.
gate
six
was
opened
32
inches
and
water
was
coming
through
at
5700
feet.
i
haven't
got
the
figures
on
the
actual
discharge
of
the
water
in
gate
five
(inaudible)
gate
one,
but
the
main
water
was
--
was
coming
through
on
gates
eight,
seven
and
six.
on
the
date
of
the
accident
then,
and
these
are
all
stipulated
facts,
they're
in
the
findings
of
fact,
the
--
larson
assembled
this
crew
and
told
them
what
to
do
and
sent
them
out
there.
and
with
the
tug,
pushed
a
barge
up,
and
they
started
here,
and
they
went
around
here,
and
they
went
up
into
the
river
into
the
spillway
section.
at
this
time,
of
course,
there
was
no
cause
for
them
to
this
--
it
was
a
quiet
pool
of
water
in
here
and
the
velocity
was
here.
and
they
got
up
to
this
bay
nine
and
to
make
the
long
story
short,
the
boat
and
barge
and
tug
started
to
yoke,
got
into
the
turbulent
current
in
front
of
gate
eight
and
immediately
capsized,
turned
right
over
and
all
these
men
were
drowned.
one
--
one
escaped.
their
three
cases
were
consolidated
under
the
tort
claims
act.
the
other
two
cases
now
are
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it's
been
stipulated
that
the
decision
in
this
case
will
govern
the
other
cases.
now,
the
petitioner,
i,
of
course,
represent
the
administrator
of
the
estate
of
mr.
graham
but
the
cause
of
actions
for
the
benefit
of
the
real
minor
children,
the
suit
was
brought
in
to
the
district
court
on
two
--
under
two
statutes.
first,
the
regular
lord
campbell's
act
of
oregon,
oregon
long
possessed
statutes
that
time
at
$15,000
limit.
secondly,
a
special
statutory
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
created
by
the
oregon
employers'
liability
law.
this
latter
argument
statute
provides
in
substance
that
owners
and
contractors
responsible
for
work
involving
risk
and
danger
shall
use
every
device,
care
and
precaution
which
is
practical
for
the
use
for
the
protection
of
--
and
safety
of
life
and
limb
limited
only
by
the
necessity
for
preserving
the
efficiency
of
the
operation
of
the
structure
and
without
regard
to
additional
cause
of
suitable
material
or
safety
appliances
and
devices.
now,
the
district
court
held,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
under
the
oregon
wrongful
death
act,
the
government
was
not
guilty
of
negligence.and
secondly,
it
held
that
to
apply
this
oregon
statute
which
creates
this
by
degree
of
care
every
--
every
device
care
and
proportion
would
append
the
so-called
jensen
doctrine
or
it'd
be
unconstitutional
to
do
so.
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
that
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
that's
right.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
yes,
sir.
it
held
that
this,
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
oregon
statute
had
no
occupation
here
because
the
higher
standard
of
care
that
it
created
was
prejudicial
to
the
uniformity
of
maritime
law.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
oh,
the
wrongful
death
statute
is
the
usual
one,
your
honor,
for
negligent
conduct.
the
court
didn't
have
the
occasion
to
consider
whether
unseaworthiness
was
embraced
in
that
statute
because
there's
no
issue
of
unseaworthiness
here,
that
no
ship
was
involved,
i
mean
no
seamen
involved.
the
carpenter
who
was
--
as
we
will
develop
later
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
no,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
those
findings.
the
government
was
not
negligent.
and
we
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
we're
--
i'm
raising
in
this
--
we're
raising
in
this
court
the
one
legal
question,
whether
or
not
the
lower
court
erred
in
holding,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
employers'
liability
act
of
oregon
could
not
be
applied
to
this
case.
of
course,
the
underlying
feature
was
that
this
death
was
a
drowning.
therefore,
it
was
on
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
and
--
and
therefore,
general
maritime
law
applied.
now,
i
have
three
main
arguments,
your
honor.
the
first
one
is
the
fact
that
we're
in
here,
in
the
court's
on
federal
tort
claims
act,
which
provides
for
the
liability
of
the
united
states
for
death
on
account
of
negligent
acts
or
omissions
of
government
employees
under
circumstances
where
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person,
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
and
we
say
that
by
using
that
peculiar
statutory
phrase,
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
rather
than
the
law
where
the
injury
or
death
occurred,
that
congress
intended
to
change
the
ordinary
conflicts
of
law
rules
and
federal
tort
claims
at
cases.
and
that
here,
any
negligence
that
we
claimed
on
part
of
the
employees
of
the
united
states
was
their
own
negligence,
not
imputed
or
anything
like
that,
their
own
negligence
was
in
the
operation
of
the
dam
because
in
--
in
other
words,
we
say
that
they
should,
knowing
all
the
dangers
and
being
advised
just
where
this
operation
was
going
to
be
carried
out,
they
should
have
taken
every
device,
care
and
precaution
by
closing
more
gates
and
creating
a
quiet
pool
up
on
the
washington
side
so
that
--
that
they
could
be
sure
that
this
tug-and-barge
wouldn't
run
into
turbulent
waters.
that
it
would
stay
over
in
the
quiet
waters.
that
they
knew
just
the
way
the
operation
was
going
to
be
handled,
and
that
that
negligence
or
those
omissions
to
act
occurred
on
the
dam
and
the
dam
is
a
shore
structure.
it's
an
extension
of
a
land.
i
think
the
cases
in
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeal
bear
that
out,
decided
in
the
brief.
the
mere
fact
that
the
presence
of
the
dam
might
affect
the
flow
of
water
and
therefore,
by
--
ultimately
facilitate
navigation.
it's
not
enough
under
the
standard
of
united
states
versus
the
panoil
in
266
u.s.
that
was
a
big
dike
which
was
held
to
be
a
--
a
shore
structure.
you
can
see
that
--
that
the
distance
--
this
is
the
oregon
shore,
which
is
the
powerhouse
of
the
rest
of
the
island
and
the
dam.
this
is
at
--
we're
talking
about
a
shore
structure
therefore,
any
negligent
act
or
omission
occurred
on
the
land
and
maritime
law
is
completely
immaterial.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
whittaker
in
the
previous
argument
said,
what
better
guide
to
legislative
interpretation
do
you
have
than
the
words
that
congress
used,
and
the
words
that
congress
used
are
a
very
explicit,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
eastern
air
lines
versus
united
states
followed
that
language
and
they
held
that
where
the
negligent
act
of
the
united
states
was
in
the
operation
of
an
airport
tower
that
was
in
virginia,
and
this
airplane
crushed
in
the
potomac
which
is
part
of
the
district
of
columbia,
that
the
liability
of
united
states
was
limited
by
the
limits
of
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
virginia
because
that
was
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
negligent
act
or
omission
occurred,
and
that
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
that
case.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
well
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
they
weren't
required
to
go
any
further
than
that,
justice
stewart,
because
you
had
two
states
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
--
you
had
the
district
of
columbia
and
virginia
here.
you
have
land
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
--
and
water.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
but
congress
could
have
used
the
word
“state”,
it
didn't
use
the
word
“place”.
“place”,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
broader
term
than
state,
the
law
of
the
place.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
yes,
sir.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
that's
right.
and
then
the
--
and
the
law
would
be
the
oregon
statutory
law
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
yes.
if
there's
a
statute
then
there
would
be
--
in
other
words,
the
liability
of
the
united
states
is
the
same
as
of
a
private
person
and
if
a
private
person
would
be
governed
by
the
oregon
employers'
liability
law
then
so
with
--
of
united
states.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
that's
right,
sir.
yes.
now,
going
on
to
another
argument,
we
say
that
in
any
event,
apart
from
this
interpretation
of
the
tort
claims
act
that
to
apply
the
employers'
liability
act
does
not
work
material
prejudice
to
characteristic
features
of
the
maritime
law
or
interfere
with
the
uniformity
of
that
law
because
any
wrongful
death
statute
that
is
applied
that
does
that
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent.
actually,
this
--
this
device,
care
and
precaution,
every
device,
care
and
precaution
standards
of
the
oregon
act
is
not
very
much
different
from
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
which,
of
course,
in
absolute
non-delegable
duty
to
furnish
a
seaworthy
ship.
and
that
duty
is
not
satisfied
just
because
the
shipowner
may
use
reasonable
care.
the
incidents
of
this
employers'
liability
act
are
much
closer
to
principles
of
general
maritime
law.they're
applied
in
admiralty
courts
because
in
the
oregon
wrongful
death
act,
you
have
contributory
negligence
as
a
complete
defense,
the
function
of
risk
as
a
complete
defense
and
in
the
employers'
liability
act,
contributory
negligence
is
only
in
mitigation
of
damages,
assumption
of
risk
is
no
defense,
negligence,
at
all,
serving
is
no
defense.
so
that
from
a
point
of
view
of
prejudice
of
a
state
statute
to
maritime
law,
it
has
been
assuming
that
maritime
law
might
--
might
govern.
we
don't
see
that
--
that
we
have
a
situation
which
requires
a
rejection
of
a
--
of
a
state
statute
if
it's
applicable.
now,
apart
--
then,
your
honor,
after
the
petitioner
for
writ
was
filed,
the
court
wrote
two
opinions
that
we
think
are
very
relevant
to
this
case.
and
one
is
tungus
versus
skovgaard.
and
that
decision
of
the
court
shows
that
a
wrongful
death
statute
must
be
applied
as
an
integrated
whole,
and
that
to
do
so,
does
not
interfere
or
--
or
prejudice
the
uniformity
of
maritime
law.
so
if
you
take
this
oregon
--
the
argument's
been
made,
of
course,
that
while
you
take
the
remedy
of
the
oregon
employers'
liability
act
and
then
you
apply
the
standards
of
general
maritime
law,
something
like
that,
but
that
whole
idea
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
tungus
case.
and
there
--
and
therefore,
if
--
if
the
oregon
employers'
liability
act
is
otherwise
applicable,
then
it
must
be
applied
in
entirety,
in
its
entirety.
and
to
do
so,
it
doesn't
offend
the
uniformity
of
maritime
law,
and
of
course,
the
principle
behind
all
that
is
that
--
that
there
was
no
remedy
for
wrongful
death
that
--
in
admiralty,
and
therefore,
the
state
statutes
will
avoid,
and
that
there
are
many
cases
on
that,
some
of
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
then
an
entirely
different
principle
is
this.
that
the
case
of
hahn
versus
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company
where
this
court
reversed
the
argument
of
the
supreme
court
is
--
is
the
embodiment
of
the
oregon
law.
it's
not
the
oregon
supreme
court's
opinion
in
that
case
because
that's
been
reversed
and
taken
out,
so
that
this
court's
opinion
is
--
is
the
oregon
law.
and
there,
the
court
held
under
fairly
similar
facts,
in
other
words,
i
think
our
case
is
found
there,
that
mr.
hahn
who
had
a
job
repairing
a
barge
on
navigable
waters
in
the
willamette
river,
his
--
he
went
onboard
a
barge
to
--
and
climbed
up
a
ladder
to
repair
some
winch
up
there
and
he
fell
off
the
ladder.
that
--
that
his
employment
and
the
character
of
that
tort
was
local
in
nature.
and
here,
we
say
that
this
whole
controversy
is
local
in
nature
that
we're
not
dealing
with
a
ship,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
commerce
or
vessels
going
from
port
to
port
down
up
the
coast.
we
have
the
dam
that
just
sits
there
on
the
columbia
river
and
it
never
moves
and
--
and
there's
no
--
and
--
and
this
fellow
graham
was
not
a
seaman,
he's
--
he
was
a
carpenter,
and
he
just
happened
to
be
out
that
day
on
the
river.
mostly
the
work
requires
would
--
under
the
contract,
it
must
be
done
in
here,
commencing
his
work
when
the
water
was
taken
out,
and
this
is
the
area.
that
was
upon
the
purpose
of
--
of
this
contract.
and
so
if
--
certainly
if
hahn
was
in
the
twilight
zone,
i'd
say
that
mr.
graham
was
also,
and
of
course,
it's
the
nature
of
the
general
employment
and
employers-employees'
activities
at
the
time
of
death
which
governs,
there's
been
an
argument
here
that
--
well,
the
statute
says
that
the
bonneville
dam
is
an
aid
of
navigation.
and
that's
what
the
statute
says,
of
course.
but
the
aid
to
navigation
of
the
bonneville
dam
i
was
--
it
was
the
zip
lock
that
was
put
in
to
here.
certainly,
the
dam
was
not
an
aid
to
navigation.
it's
an
instruction
to
navigation.
it's
been
--
it's
been
recognized
or
dams
have
been
recognized
as
instructions
in
navigation
in
--
in
many
cases.
so
the
question
remains
then,
your
honors,
whether
under
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
employers
by
the
--
by
the
court,
district
court,
affirmed,
and
--
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
this
fellow,
graham,
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
oregon
employers'
liability
act
remembering
that
he
is
not
an
employee
of
the
united
states,
and
remembering
that
the
liability
of
the
united
states
is
the
same
as
a
private
person.
and
this
is
quite
an
intricate
question
of
oregon
law
if
the
court
will
see
when
it
reviews
the
cases.
but
we
say
that
the
oregon
cases
show
five
basic
criteria
which
are
all
met
under
the
undisputed
findings
of
fact
that
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court
that
he
wasn't
entitled,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
the
protection
of
the
act
was
induced
by
erroneous
conclusion
of
the
law.
now,
under
the
oregon
cases,
a
plaintiff
must
be
an
employee
of
someone
and
must
have
relation
towards
the
defendant
different
from
that
of
a
member
of
the
general
public.
and
that's
what
this
thought.
he
was
employed
by
contract
in
working
for
--
for
the
united
states,
for
his
employer
but
he
wasn't
a
member
of
the
general
public.
and
his
duties
must
require
his
presence
in
the
vicinity
of
a
hazardous
condition
and
a
working
button
must
involve
risk
and
danger.
there's
no
question
that
--
that
those
--
that
that
condition
was
fulfilled.
now,
the
defendant
must
be
an
employer,
and
the
united
states
was
an
employer
of
people
on
the
bonneville
dam,
and
there
must
be
a
common
purpose
or
mutual
benefit
in
the
relationship
between
the
defendant
and
the
plaintiff's
employer.
and
here,
this
contract
is
the
tie
between
the
united
states
and
the
plaintiff's
and
decedent's
employer.
now,
then,
most
important,
the
defendant,
under
these
oregon
cases,
particularly
myers
versus
staub,
201
oregon,
the
defendant
must
have
had
primary
control
over
the
instrumentalities
in
use
which
is
the
media
of
injuries
or
death
giving
rise
to
the
claims
for
damage.
and
that
is
the
situation
here.
the
government
had
exclusive
control
to
regulate
in
a
few
(inaudible)
and
of
how
much
water
would
be
allowed
to
flow
down,
and
has
exclusive
control
over
the
--
the
whole
operation
not
to
contract
of
operation
but
their
own
operation
in
running
that
dam.
and
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
work
of
the
--
of
the
decedent's
employer.
it
--
it
is
work,
work
that's
being
done.
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
the
work
that
this
injured
person
is
doing.
and
that's
illustrated
particularly
by
that
walters
versus
the
dock
commission
in
126
oregon.
that's
extensively
briefed
in
my
brief.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
well,
the
district
court
made
such
a
finding.
the
court
of
appeals
held
as
a
matter
of
law
the
employers'
liability
act
didn't
apply
so
it
said
in
a
footnote
that
it
was
not
required
to
pass
on
these
facts.
but
the
--
the
district
court
did
find
that.
we
say
that
that
is
a
relevant
consideration,
a
wrong
deduction
from
the
fact.
now,
then,
the
--
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
i
haven't
specifically
mentioned
that
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
but
the
hawkins
there
or
was
pure
dicta
in
that
hawkins
case
and
that
has
not
been
followed.
the
decisions
from
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
oregon
was
contrary
as
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
footnote
7
on
that.
mr.
cleveland
c.
cory
yes,
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
final
inquiry
is
whether
the
government
did
use
every
device,
care
and
precaution,
and
we
say
that
the
undisputed
fact
shows
the
government
did
not.
the
case
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
