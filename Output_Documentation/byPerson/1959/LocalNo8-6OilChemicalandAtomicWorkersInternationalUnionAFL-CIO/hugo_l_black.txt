justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
governor's
office?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
--
how
did
the
court
distinguish
the
amalgamated
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
follow
the
dissent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
would
they
be
involved
if
this
court
should
reverse
that
supreme
court
of
missouri
is
holding
here
and
saying
the
seizure
is
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
would
be
involved
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
dispose
of
the
other
constitution
effects
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you
suggest
are
non-frivolous.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
enjoined?
is
that
the
injunction
we
have
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
enjoined
at
all?
all
that
which
you're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
arguing
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you
can
force
men
to
go
back
to
as
a
reason
to
keep
breakage
from
happening?
are
--
or
is
there
something
that
these
men
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
that
denied
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
is
that
part
of
what
you
said
denied
but
it
--
your
adversary,
i
didn't
so
understand.
i
didn't
understand.
they
claim
that
the
state
couldn't
take
applicable
measures
which
is
permitted
to
do
not
in
violation
of
federal
law
to
forbid
increase
to
the
public
health.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
think
so,
because
it
seems
to
me
from
what
you
say
that
on
question
of
your
circum
--
circumstances
like
that
would
be
injurious
to
the
public
health.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
that's
not
the
issue
that
he's
presented.
maybe
he's
wrong
in
this.
he's
presented
the
issue
as
to
whether
congress
has
decided
that
so
far
as
the
strike
is
concerned
that
is
peaceful.
the
federal
court
--
the
federal
agency
shall
have
power
to
enjoin
and
announce
that
nobody
else
shall,
the
strike.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
real
legal
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
shows
us
color
and
of
course
gives
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
jury
appeal
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it.
but
there's
no
dispute
between
you
as
for
that
but
the
state
can
take
all
means
just
wants
to
do
that.
they
say
that
--
that
one
thing
it
can't
do
is
it
can't
decide
to
stop
a
peaceful
strike.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
your
sole
legal
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
it
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
act
as
it
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
find?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
find,
the
fact
of
which
you're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
find
that
there
was
a
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
might
be
injurious
to
the
health?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
did
make
the
finding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
was
the
finding
necessary
for
coordination
injunction
assuming
that
they
can't
enjoin
the
peaceful
strike?
why
was
it
--
why
was
it
necessary
for
the
governor
to
make
any
kind
of
statement?
it
didn't
approve
that
the
health
of
the
people
was
being
injured
and
was
being
imperiled
or
jeopardized
by
such
sabotage
that
you
mentioned.
i
should
suppose
it
ordinarily
a
state
would
have
that
right
for
that
the
special
situation,
assuming
the
thing
it
enjoined
is
not
forbidden
to
it
by
the
federal
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unquestionably
it
does
unless
it's
forbidden
by
federal
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
was
saying,
what
i
don't
quite
see
the
great
relevance
here
was
the
governor,
here
the
facts
or
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
about
the
condition
that
that's
going
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
state
i
always
think
ordinarily
unless
there's
some
federal
law
that
forbids
it.
every
state
would
have
to
use
its
court's
power
to
presume.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
part
of
the
procedure
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
do
not
see
myself
that
the
state
gets
anymore
power
from
the
fact
that
there's
a
statute
to
enjoin
a
peaceful
strike
that
it
would
have
didn't
have
that
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
--
i
agree
to
that
but
you
finally
get
back
to
the
one
question
as
to
whether
it's
forbidden
to
stop
a
peaceful
strike
by
the
federal
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
is
that
the
missouri
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
validity
of
that
statute
that's
been
applied
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
there's
no
doubt
with
--
no
disagreement
upon
it
that
you'd
enjoin
the
union
on
evidence
perpetrating
sabotage,
(inaudible)
injurious
to
health,
enjoined
in
the
people
that
you
wouldn't
have
violated
in
the
federal
statute.
no
--
no
disagreement,
is
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
can
do
if
it's
not
forbidden
by
the
federal
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
invalidate
statutes
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i
understood
is
--
is
reign
of
the
fact
that
if
you're
to
stop
the
strike
by
public
utility,
because
there
were
inherency,
and
it
would
be
a
trouble,
such
as
what's
done
here.
and
here,
you're
--
you're
taking
that
your
court
has
the
right
to
prohibit
a
peaceful
strike,
if
while
those
strikes
are
going
on.
something
happens
that
nearly
everybody
knows
happens
during
strikes
and
--
and
they
declined
senator
holland's
amendment
to
that
effect,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
--
your
--
your
present
statue
has
the
right
to
compulsory
arbitration.
the
strike
involves
congress
with
the
effect
that
it
could
be
done
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
can
be
shown
that
during
the
strike
something
is
happening
in
connection
with
the
words
that's
injurious
to
public
health.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
be
impaired,
that
i
would
say
with
greatly
impaired.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
makes
--
makes
them
to
go
back
to
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
tell
them
--
well
suppose,
they
don't
work
it
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
the
--
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
compel
it.
i'm
not
saying
it's
(inaudible)
i
don't
know.
it
--
this
is
on
a
very,
very
sensitive
field
and
one
which
requires
close
attention
by
all
the
legislative
bodies
whether
you
get
it,
i
agree
with
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
problem
in
my
mind
is
that
the
congress
has
protected
--
taken
for
itself,
on
itself,
to
decide
a
peaceful
strike
all
right
and
you
can't
forbid
them
by
reason
of
things
that
occurred
during
those
peaceful
strikes,
which
is
not
done
by
the
union
would
give
a
chance
to
have
gone
otherwise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
after
these
people
were
forced
to
go
back
to
work
if
things
continued
at
a
greater
pace.
what
--
what
could
you
he
do
then?
what
would
you
do
then?
what
would
the
courts
do
then?
it's
not
likely
sometimes
to
create
a
feeling
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
friendship
and
loveliness
and
affection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
none
of
us
disagree
that
this
is
a
serious
thing.
it's
not
a
question
of
jury
speech
as
to
how
much
the
health
is
impaired.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
congress
has
taken
to
itself
how
to
say
that
peaceful
strikes
shall
not
to
be
forbidden
by
state
or
anybody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
here
you
say
that
peaceful
strikes
can
be
forbidden
if
it's
found
that
during
a
peaceful
strike
something
has
occurred,
which
will
injure
the
public
health.
and
which
i
agree
with
you
is
--
i
--
i
don't
think
anyone
--
i
don't
think
it
need
evidence
to
show
that
it's
a
--
it's
a
thing
that
occurs
frequently
when
strikes
occur.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we
could
(inaudible)
just
for
this
particular
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
statement
was
that?
what
did
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
senator
taft
state,
you
said
go
back
to
his
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
have
it
right
before
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
21
is
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it
returned
here?
