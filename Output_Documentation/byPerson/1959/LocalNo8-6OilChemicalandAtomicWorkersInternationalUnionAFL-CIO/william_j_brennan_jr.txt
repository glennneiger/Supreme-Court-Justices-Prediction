that
the
congress
decided
that
--
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
what
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
amalgamated
case
up
for
discussion
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
take
it
in
your
own
time.
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
any
such
suits
been
started?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
continued?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
welborn,
my
question
is
that
--
a
suggestion
of
witness
on
the
same
ground
now
as
to
--
is
made
in
this
missouri
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
--
am
i
correct
that
the
grounds
--
that
that
suggestion
there,
no
different
from
those
that
arose
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
welborn
may
i
ask
you?
is
your
argument
the
state
power
to
go
this
far,
suppose
we
didn't
have
a
utility,
let's
some
manufacturer
of
automobiles
or
airplanes
or
anything
else
whose
employees
went
on
strike
and
the
strike
was
conducted
peacefully
insofar
as
the
strike
of
the
employees
is
concern,
but
it's
a
small
town,
the
employer
and
the
hardships
did
ensue
in
the
form
of
threats,
health
or
actual
illnesses
or
lack
of
food
or
fuel
and
the
light,
and
a
situation
develops
were
crime
gets
out
of
hand.
now,
in
that
circumstance,
could
say
that
the
state
had
power
to
have
such
a
statute
as
here
applicable
only
to
utilities,
to
compel
the
strikers
to
go
back
to
work?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wonder
how
--
how
do
we
differ
in
terms
of
state
power
how
do
we
differ,
in
that
situation
for
the
one
that
has
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
assuming
a
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
assuming
a
statute
in
the
case
i
put
to
you.
i
assume
the
state
adopts
the
statute
appropriate
to
reach
the
situation
i
have
hypothesized.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
if
this
is
so,
then
the
question
we
have
to
decide
here
whether
this
statute
can
stand
in
the
face
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
there's
a
broader
problem
than
just
the
one
involving
utility
business.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
