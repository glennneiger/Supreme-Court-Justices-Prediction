what
about
the
liabilities
for
tort
doing
government
state
operation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
theory,
we
didn't
know,
did
we,
how
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
would
decide
that
penalty
suit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
the
judge
thought
that
these
are
the
indications
of
that.
what
is
the
feeling
of
that
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
how
do
you
say
mr.
welborn
about
mr.
ratner's
argument
that
there
are
pending
actions
done
at
st.
louis
in
the
circuit
court
against
officers
of
the
union
and
the
union
for
these
penalties
under
the
king-thompson
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
has
there
ever
been
a
decision
on
that
question
by
even
an
intermediate
appellate
court
in
missouri?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
it's
therefore
now
unknown
as
to
whether
any
appellate
court
in
missouri
would
sustain
either
the
seniority
laws
provision
here
or
these
penalties?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
i
thought
it
was
true
that
the
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
expressly
excludes
from
conclusion
or
decision
any
issue
respecting
penalties.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
seizure
could
be
valid
and
yet
the
penalty
is
to
be
invalid.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
all
i'm
getting
at
--
all
i'm
getting
at
is
whether
or
not
any
finger
can
be
put
to
anything
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion
that
is
a
determination
of
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
these
penalties.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
say
that
regardless
of
who
is
responsible
for
these
untoward
events
in
the
system,
they
resulted
in
those
untoward
events
which
were
not
events
that
occurred
before
the
strike?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
they
occurred
only
strike
time
not
otherwise?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
did
you
say
that,
i
understood
it
was
to
be
a
--
it
was
a
part
of
your
argument
that
try
as
you
will
strikes
of
this
character
cannot
be
and
in
a
true
sense
peaceful?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
they
do
arise
in
a
strike,
it
didn't
occur
before.
isn't
this
--
isn't
this
your
argument
under
or
maybe
i
am
not
understanding
you,
that
strikes
in
utilities
cannot
from
the
very
nature
of
the
things
try
as
hard
as
both
sides
will
be
in
any
true
sense
peaceful,
is
that
right?

charles

whittaker
(voice

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
mean
by
that,
if
i
may
ask
you
to
detract
to
withdrawing
with
your
agreement
on
the
mootness
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
mean
to
water
down
your
argument
on
the
mootness
question?
