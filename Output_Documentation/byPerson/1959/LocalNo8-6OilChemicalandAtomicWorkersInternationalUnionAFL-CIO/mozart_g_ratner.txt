mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
missouri,
which
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
missouri's
token
seizure
no
strike
law,
the
so-called
king-thompson
act
as
applied
to
the
laclede
gas
company.
the
missouri
supreme
court
found
that
all
sides
concede.
missouri's
operations
affect
interstate
commerce
so
that
strikes
against
laclede
by
its
employees
are
governed
by
federal
law.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
missouri
is
encroached
upon
federal
supremacy
by
bringing
to
bear
upon
a
strike
and
upon
strikes
by
employees
of
laclede
against
that
company,
its
own
sovereign
power
to
declare
such
strikes
illegal.
this
court
postponed
the
question
of
jurisdiction
to
the
argument
on
the
merits.
so
that
after
briefly
summarizing
the
facts
concerning
the
statute's
operations
and
its
application
to
the
facts
of
this
case
which
gave
rise
to
the
issue
here,
i
will
turn
next
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
in
missouri,
the
governor
derives
power
to
seize
a
public
utility.
upon
investigation
and
the
proclamation
by
him
that
a
strike
is
threatened
or
has
occurred,
which
threatens
to
interrupt
the
operation
of
the
utility
and
thereby
jeopardize
the
public
interest,
health
and
welfare.
upon
the
proclamation
of
a
seizure
by
the
governor,
it
becomes
unlawful
for
the
employees
of
the
utility
to
continue
their
strike.
any
labor
organization
which
has
called
the
strike
comes
under
immediate
obligation
to
call
it
off
and
officers
of
that
labor
organization
are
under
a
duty
to
cease
supporting
it.
the
most
important
fact
about
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
itself
has
said
that
seizure
by
the
governor
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
missouri
law
is
a
token
seizure.
that
possession
of
the
utility
by
the
state
is
nominal
only
and
not
actual,
that
the
utility
company,
a
private
company
itself,
continues
to
operate
the
utility
on
its
own
account,
that
the
state
of
missouri
does
not
become
the
employer
of
the
employees
but
rather
the
private
company,
in
this
instance,
laclede,
remains
the
employer
and
the
utility's
employees
remain
the
employees
of
a
private
employer.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
in
rider
versus
julian,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
held
that
liability
rests
with
laclede
and
not
with
the
state.
that
is
the
most
important
fact
of
this
case
because
it
demonstrates
that
throughout
the
strike
by
laclede's
employees
against
laclede
or
any
utility's
employees
against
any
utility
which
is
subject
to
this
act,
the
national
labor
relations
act
remains
fully
and
completely
applicable.
your
honors
know
of
course
that
section
22
of
the
taft-hartley
act
exempts
the
state
and
its
political
subdivisions
from
the
category
of
employer
and
exempts
equally
state
employees
from
the
category
of
employee.
so,
that
national
law
is
not
applicable
to
enterprises
which
are
owned
and
operated
by
the
state
and
state
employees.
so,
the
missouri
supreme
court's
findings
in
rider
versus
julian
and
its
authoritative
construction
of
the
state
law
removes
entirely
from
the
purview
of
this
case
that
entire
class
of
questions
which
could
conceivably
arise
under
other
kinds
of
seizures
statutes
in
which
a
state
may
be
exercising
its
power
of
eminent
domain
to
take
over
and
operate
on
its
own
account
a
public
utility.
it
removes
even
the
questions
that
might
arise
under
statutes
where
attempt
--
where
a
state
attempts
to
make
seizure
of
work
as
temporary
matter
to
resolve
the
labor
dispute,
if
your
honors
please.
if
under
the
state
statute,
the
state
becomes
the
actual
employer
of
the
employees
and
operates
the
utility
on
its
own
account.
those
questions
are
simply
not
here.
here,
seizure
is
simply
a
talisman.
it
is
a
magic
formula
which
transforms
a
legal
strike
protected
by
federal
law
into
an
illegal
strike
which
missouri
prohibits.
and
what
consequences
does
missouri
attach
to
that
prohibition?
severe
ones
indeed.
the
statute
says
that
any
employee
who
dares
to
continue
with
strike
after
the
governor
has
issued
a
seizure
proclamation
may
be
rehired
by
the
public
utility
thereafter
only
as
a
new
employee.
the
statute,
by
its
own
force,
takes
from
him
all
of
his
seniority
rights
that
he
may
have
built
up
under
contracts
and
service
over
periods
of
20
and
more
years.
and
there
are
employees
with
this
utility
who's
served
for
more
than
20
years.
the
statute
levies
on
any
labor
organization
which
has
the
temerity
to
continue
a
strike
after
the
governor's
proclamation
of
a
seizure,
a
fine
of
$10,000
a
day
for
everyday
that
they
do
not
see
to
it
that
the
strike
has
ended.
and
the
statute
levies
and
every
labor
organization
office
a
fine
of
$1,000
should
he
have
the
temerity
to
continue
to
support
a
strike
after
seizure.
it's
noteworthy
too
that
under
this
statute,
there
is
no
provision
that
while
seizure
is
in
effect,
the
company
must
keep
in
effect
any
particular
terms
or
conditions
of
employment.
for
all
that
appears
under
this
statute
and
under
the
proclamations
that
we
have
before
us
in
this
case,
laclede
was
free
to
impose
after
seizure
any
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
that
it
might
mean
to
laterally
choose
to
impose.
and
the
statute
does
serve
that
immediately
the
labor
dispute
is
settled,
the
governor
should
terminate
the
seizure.
now,
of
course
the
consequence
of
such
a
statute
in
operation
upon
a
union
is
just
this.
they're
put
in
a
dilemma.
they
must
either
work
indefinite
on
terms
that
the
utility
dictates
or
they
must
accept
the
collective
bargaining
contract
as
good
as
the
utility
offers
and
no
better.
from
that
dilemma,
there
is
under
this
statute,
no
escape.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
simple.
a
collective
bargaining
contract
between
the
company
and
laclede
expired
on
the
30th
of
june
of
1956.
you'll
notice
this
is
under
federal
law
were
given
it
under
state
law
and
on
the
1st
of
july
of
1956
a
strike
began.
within
a
couple
of
days,
rogers,
the
governor's
deputy
warned
the
union
that
it
better
had
call
of
its
strike
or
the
governor
would
invoke
seizure.
on
the
5th
of
july,
the
governor
seized.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes
your
honor.
he
issued
a
seizure
proclamation.
on
the
9th
of
july
a
petition
was
filed
for
an
injunction
to
prohibit
continuation
of
the
strike.
in
addition,
suits
were
filed
then
and
shortly
thereafter
to
collect
the
penalties
that
the
missouri
act
provides
for
the
employees
did
not
call
off
their
strike
and
the
unions
did
not
terminate
upon
the
seizure.
in
answer
to
the
petition
for
injunction,
the
unions
filed
an
answer
and
a
petition
for
declaratory
judgment
alleging
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
alleging
that
they
were
suffering
irreparable
injury
by
the
effect
to
enforce
it
by
its
enforcement
against
them.
alleging
that
the
field
had
been
preempted
principally
that
in
the
fourteenth
and
thirteenth
amendment
arguments
as
well.
the
trial
court
first
denied
the
motion
for
declaratory
--
the
petition
for
declaratory
judgment
and
then
amended
its
decree
to
grant
it.
it
found
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
amalgamated
bus
employees
case
involving
the
wisconsin
statute
which
bans
strikes
in
public
utilities
and
substituted
compulsory
arbitration
for
it
was
not
controlling,
it
held
that
missouri
had
a
right
to
apply
its
seizure
statute
to
this
dispute
and
that
its
application
was
constitutional.
it
found
specifically
that
the
employees
and
the
union
had
continued
their
strike
after
seizure.
it
found
that
that's
--
the
continuation
was
illegal.
it
issued
both,
an
injunction
which
is
in
terms
perpetual,
and
a
declaratory
judgment
saying
that
it
was
unlawful
for
the
union
and
the
employees
to
strike
as
long
as
the
governor's
seizure
order
was
in
effect.
it
was
contended
by
amicus
curiae
in
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
the
court
distinguished
the
amalgamated
case
mr.
justice
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
--
i
was
about
to
say
that
in
my
view
the
only
way
that
they
distinguished
it
is
by
preferring
the
dissent,
but
my
opponent
apparently
doesn't
agree
with
that
because
he
thinks
that
there
are
distinctions.
i
will
in
the
course
of
this
attempt
to
indicate
that
the
distinctions
are
invalid,
that
they
are
figments
of
imagination
really.
but,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
issue
in
this
case
was
faced
and
squarely
faced
by
this
court
in
the
amalgamated
case.
and
that
it
was
faced
again
after
the
amalgamated
case
when
this
court
told
congress
that
it
was
congress'
problem
and
not
this
court's
problem
faced
and
clearly
faced
by
congress.
then
congress
again
decided
that
this
court
was
wrong.
it
again
shows
uniformity.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
congress
decided
it
again.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
in
the
landrum-griffin
bill,
congress
faced
the
question
of
federal
preemption.
it
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes
your
honor
i'll
come
to
that
a
little
later.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
amalgamated
case
did
come
up
for
discussion.
indeed,
an
amendment
was
proposed
to
overrule
it
and
it
was
reject
in
the
face
of
this
court's
statement
to
congress
that
if
you're
going
to
make
a
different
rule
for
public
utilities
or
local
emergency
disputes,
it's
up
to
congress
to
make
it.
senator
holland
proposed
that
congress
make
it
and
congress
turned
him
down.
it
is
--
this
is
the
most
dramatic
reaffirmation
of
--
of
the
preemption
rule
as
it
applies
to
public
utilities
and
local
emergencies
disputes.
in
my
opinion,
it
is
possible
to
have
had
it.
but
before
turning
again
to
the
merits
in
more
detail,
we
say
that
it
was
suggested
below
by
amicus
curiae
though
then
not
by
appellee
here
that
this
case
had
somehow
become
moot,
because
following
the
seizure
and
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
which
compelled
the
employees
and
the
union
to
go
back
to
work,
the
union
had
caved
in,
in
the
face
of
the
dilemma
that
the
missouri
statute
put
it
in
and
chose
rather
than
to
work
on
laclede
unilaterally
imposed
terms
a
contract
on
the
terms
that
laclede
chose
to
offer.
and
having
chosen
the
contract,
the
statute
then
worked
in
accordance
with
its
terms
for
the
governor
gave
up
the
seizure,
the
dispute
was
over,
and
so
it's
argued
that
the
injunction
by
its
own
terms
has
expired.
we've
chosen
not
to
argue
the
question
whether
the
injunction
has
in
fact
expired.
we
read
the
declaratory
judgment
into
the
injunction
as
though
the
injunction
too
carries
with
it
an
implication
that
it
prohibits
strikes
only
during
the
period
of
seizure.
but
we
think
it
perfectly
clear
that
this
case
that
raises
that
constitutional
issue
cannot
possibly
be
moot,
too
much
hinges
upon
resolution
of
the
question.
this
is
no
abstract
issue.
these
unions
are
subject
to
penalties
of
$210,000
if
missouri
has
a
constitutional
right
to
outlaw
their
strike.
these
officers
are
subject
to
penalties
of
$1,000
of
piece.
and
it
was
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes
your
honor.
such
suits
are
--
were
started
as
i
indicated
in
the
statement
of
fact.
they
were
started
almost
contemporaneously
with
the
filing
of
this
injunction
suit.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
they
are
continued
and
missouri
is
pressing
to
collect
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
the
very
pressured
to
collect
the
damages
which
appellee
says
ought
to
lead
this
court
now
to
defer
decision
of
the
constitutional
question
until
the
penalty
case
has
reached
this
court
on
the
theory
that
this
court
will
not
decide
the
constitutional
issue
unless
it's
necessary
to
the
solution
of
a
real
case.
we
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no,
your
honor
we
do
not.
it
is
entirely
conceivable
although
i
think
it's
unlike
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
will
hold
that
the
penalty
clauses
and
conceivably
even
the
seniority
clause
are
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
this
makes
absolutely
no
difference
whatsoever
with
respect
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
we
have
a
justiciable
case
or
controversy
in
this
declaratory
suit
--
judgment
suit
at
this
point.
nor
does
it
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
this
court
should
reach
constitutional
issues
here.
and
the
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
i
am
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
judge
sparkman's
opinions
in
general
to
be
able
to
read
the
implications
so
firmly.
i
did
not
suspect
that
our
clients
could
be
assured
that
they
would
suffer
no
penalties
as
a
result
of
their
defiance
for
the
seizure
order
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
in
truth,
missouri's
insistent
on
proceeding
with
the
penalty
actions
and
they
are
admittedly
insisting
on
proceeding.
and
their
insistence
which
judge
sparkman
in
his
opinion
took
special
no
doubt
that
they
will
continue
to
apply
this
statute
to
future
disputes
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
are
not
prepared
to
waive
the
enforcement
or
to
concede
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
seizure
provisions.
if
they
were,
perhaps
a
different
question
would
arise.
i
think
that
even
that
would
moot
this
case.
but
as
long
as
they
are
insisting
on
collecting
the
penalty,
it
cannot
possibly
moot
it
in
my
opinion.
and
i'm
so
sure
partly
because
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
la
crosse
telephone
case.
for
in
that
case,
this
court
passed
upon
the
constitutionality
of
wisconsin's
attempt
to
subject
la
crosse's
labor
relations
to
wisconsin
sovereign
power
in
a
proceeding
that
terminated
with
a
mere
certification
which
as
this
court
pointed
out
certainly
does
not
of
itself
command
action
and
is
really
the
equivalent
of
a
declaratory
judgment
for
the
particular
labor
organization
represents
the
majority
of
employees
and
therefore
occupies
the
status
under
the
law.
and
it
passed
upon
it
in
that
case
despite
the
fact
that
the
employer
could
be
compelled
to
bargain
with
that
union
only
in
a
separate
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
that
would
have
to
be
initiated
by
a
charge
that
wasn't
yet
in
existence.
and
despite
the
fact,
and
this
is
what's
critical
about
that
this
court
in
its
opinion
noted
that
the
wisconsin
court
might
never
issue
an
unfair
labor
practice
order
against
the
employer
if
he
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
the
basis
of
that
certification,
because
in
the
interim,
the
union
might
lose
its
majority
and
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
hold
the
certification
thereby
in
fact.
a
contingency
which
is
the
precise
equivalent
of
possibility
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
the
penalty
action
might
hold
that
the
penalty
is
itself
unconstitutional.
the
point
to
make
is
that
under
missouri
law,
the
judgment
of
constitutionality
which
is
made
in
this
suit,
in
this
declaratory
judgment
suit,
is
and
will
be
res
judicata
in
the
penalty
action.
and
the
trial
court
in
the
penalty
action
has
already
so
held,
and
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
two
missouri
cases
that
indicate
the
law
that
the
trial
court
in
the
penalty
suit
followed
and
so
hold.
incidentally,
the
record
in
the
penalty
action
to
which
i
refer
is
incorporated
in
the
record
in
this
case.
so
that
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
this
was
a
pretrial
motion
--
a
motion
for
declaratory
judgment
was
filed
in
the
penalty
action.
it
was
opposed
on
by
the
state
on
the
ground
that
the
declaratory
judgment
of
constitutionality
which
had
been
made
in
this
declaratory
judgment
action
was
res
judicata.
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
motion
of
the
penalty
suit
on
the
ground
that
res
judicata
obtained.
so,
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
mere
abstraction,
hypothetical
cases,
interim
adjudications,
this
is
as
final
as
it's
possible
for
a
judgment
to
get.
on
the
merits,
this
case
is
governed
we
think
and
clearly
governed
by
the
bus
employee's
case
and
its
companion,
united
gas
in
340
u.s.
383.
the
argument
for
the
state
principally
turns
as
i
read,
“upon
an
attempt
to
distinguish
amalgamated
under
theory
that
amalgamated
wasn't
an
emergency
case
and
this
one
is.”
but
when
they
say
that
and
when
they
hinge
their
argument
upon
it,
they
simply
ignore
the
facts
of
the
united
gas
case.

the
united
gas,
which
is
of
the
bus
employees
companion
case
and
decided
with
it
in
one
opinion,
involved
the
strike
which
was
called
the
gas
company
and
milwaukee,
wisconsin
in
october.
it's
distinguished
from
this
strike
which
was
called
against
the
st.
louis
gas
company
in
july.
it
began
at
6
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
october
the
5th,
1949.
and
in
its
opinion,
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
had
this
to
say
about
the
consequences
of
that
strike.
at
11:00
a.m.
the
public
was
advised
to
curtail
consumption
of
gas.
an
appeal
to
consumers
of
gas
was
made
to
shut
off
the
service.
the
steam
pressure
dropped
to
zero
in
the
boiler
room,
and
no
further
pumping
could
be
done
with
the
main
pumping
facilities.
the
fires
had
to
be
pulled
from
the
boilers
reducing
the
steam
pressure
and
all
facilities
had
to
be
stopped.
a
minimum
pressure
in
the
distribution
system
was
kept
in
order
that
the
air
would
not
get
into
the
mains
so
as
to
prevent
any
explosions
as
due
to
the
mixture
of
gas
and
air
in
the
distribution
system.
the
send-outs
dropped
to
25%
of
what
they
had
been
previously.
low
pressure
in
the
system
created
a
dangerous
condition
fraught
with
the
possibility
of
infinite
injury
to
the
public.
the
public
was
advised
by
radio
broadcast
and
through
newspapers
to
shut
off
appliances
and
to
shut
off
the
service
immediately.
in
the
face
of
then
because
of
those
conditions,
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
in
the
united
gas
case
compelling
the
union
immediately
to
call
off
its
strike.
at
12:55
p.m.
that
order
was
signed.
it
was
served
at
2
o'clock.
and
in
discussing
that
order
and
its
enforceability,
in
the
propriety
of
contempt
adjudication
predicated
upon
it,
the
supreme
of
wisconsin
had
this
to
say.
“we
impose
the
requirement
of
immediate
compliance,
‘because
of
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
already
referred
to
resulting
from
the
partial
or
complete
stoppage
of
the
essential
service
of
furnishing
gas
to
the
public.'”
and
to
leave
no
doubt
upon
the
--
about
the
nature
of
the
power
which
it
was
invoked
to
put
an
end
to
this
threat
to
the
public
health
and
safety,
the
wisconsin
court
quoted
at
length
from
the
decision
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
of
the
telephone
case
and
pointed
out
that
it
rested
its
decision
but
its
judgment
was
not
governed
by
this
court's
decision
in
o'brien
upon
the
fact
that
here
was
at
issue
the
public
health,
safety
and
welfare
and
that
it
was
invoking
the
inherent
power
of
the
state
to
enjoin
conduct
which
threaten
that
public
health,
safety
and
welfare.
now,
of
course,
in
its
decision
in
the
united
gas,
amalgamated,
bus
case,
this
court
did
not
upset
the
finding
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
an
emergency
existed
which
justified
the
indication
of
the
state's
police
powers
if
that
were
an
issue.
nor
did
it
challenge
the
bona
fide,
the
wisconsin's
finding
that
health
and
safety
of
the
public
were
actually
affected
and
that
there
actually
existed
an
emergency
and
that
the
state
was
relying
upon
its
power
to
protect
the
public,
health
and
safety
and
not
upon
a
law
regulating
labor
relations.
but
nonetheless,
it
reversed
wisconsin's
contempt
conviction
of
the
union
officials
who
defied
that
restraining
order,
because
it
found
that
wisconsin's
power
to
act
against
the
strike
in
that
emergency
had
been
superseded
by
the
taft-hartley
act.
superseded
by
congress's
decision
of
the
policy
question
namely,
“is
it
better
in
a
free
society
to
let
strikes
in
public
utilities
run
their
course,
to
let
collective
bargaining
go
on
in
public
utilities
unhampered?
or
is
it
more
important
that
the
people
of
the
community
be
protected
against
the
consequences
of
such
strikes,
which
may
imperil
their
health
and
safety?”
and
congress
resolved
that
policy
question
said
this
court,
clearly
because
it
looked
among
other
things
not
only
to
the
proposals
which
had
made
in
taft-hartley
to
outlaw
strikes
in
public
utilities
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
deleterious
for
the
public
welfare.
but
upon
senator
taft's
explanation
of
why
it
was
that
congress
had
repudiated
all
kinds
of
suggestions
for
limiting,
curtailing
and
emasculating
the
right
to
strike.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
certainly
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
the
court
in
the
amalgamated
case
in
the
second
full
paragraph
of
its
opinion
sets
out
in
full
the
facts
the
united
gas
case.
later
on,
several
paragraphs
later,
it
points
out
the
justifications
urged
by
the
wisconsin
court
for
its
view
of
state
power
and
those
justifications
are
to
be
found
in
the
opinion
in
the
united
gas
case
rather
than
in
the
opinion
in
amalgamated
and
at
the
end
of
its
opinion,
this
court
reverses
the
adjudication
for
contempt.
and
subsequently,
in
one
of
the
st.
john's
cases
--
st.
john's
i
believe
against
the
wisconsin
board
which
is
a
companion
to
these
two,
decided
however
in
a
separate
opinion
the
--
this
court
points
out
that
no.
438
was
decided
this
day.
if
what
your
honor
means
is
did
this
court
quote
or
refer
to
the
findings
of
the
supreme
of
wisconsin
that
i
have
read
to
you
in
this
argument,
the
answer
is
it
did
not
quote
those
findings,
nor
independently
discuss
them.
in
my
opinion,
it
did
so
only
for
the
reason
that
they
were
completely
irrelevant
on
the
--
to
the
court's
disposition
of
this
case
in
view
of
the
fact
that
what
it
was
deciding
was
not
a
due
process
question
but
a
question
of
federal
preemption.
i
don't
know
whether
i've
answered
your
question.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
words,
“independently
of
the
statute”
in
your
question
permit
me
to
answer
that
question
flatly,
no,
because
neither
wisconsin
nor
missouri
in
this
case
have
the
enjoined
this
strike
independently
of
the
statute,
so
that
that
question
is
no
more
here
than
it
was
there,
but
the
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
and
its
application
to
this
emergency
is
justified
by
some
kind
of
inherent
power
in
the
state;
that
question
was
discussed.
that
question
this
court's
(inaudible)
and
that
question
this
court
rejected
unnecessarily
so
because
the
underlying
thesis
of
its
opinion
was
that
the
policy
considerations
which
lead
to
the
exercise
or
non-exercise
of
that
kind
of
power
were
weighed
by
congress
and
that
to
allow
the
state
to
really
weigh
them
would
be
to
allow
the
state
to
repudiate
and
reverse
congress's
judgment
on
that
policy
issue.
the
shorter
the
matter
is,
as
this
court
summed
it
up
in
the
second
government,
in
the
--
in
the
bus
case
--
i'm
sorry.
congress
expressed
itself
in
favor
of
uniformity.
it
did
not
allow
the
diversity
inherent
in
the
application
of
derogated
state
laws
to
areas
which
came
within
the
purview
of
the
federal
statute,
and
public
utility
strikes
certainly
do
come
within
the
purview
of
the
federal
statute.
let
me
illustrate.
suppose
that
we
had
this
strike
in
illinois
or
this
strike
in
kentucky.
illinois
would
not
issue
an
injunction
against
this
strike.
it
has
no
such
statute
and
there
is
no
precedent
for
an
injunction
against
the
public
utility
strike
of
this
kind.
to
allow
missouri
statute
to
stand
to
enjoin
this
strike
would
result
in
a
diversity
of
treatment
of
identically
situated
department,
public
utility
workers
in
illinois
continuing
their
strike
and
public
utility
workers
in
missouri
being
enjoined.
this
is
precisely
the
judgment
not
to
allow
that
kind
of
diversity
which
this
court
in
guss
held
that
congress
made.
and
there's
no
distinction
drawable
in
my
view
on
the
ground
that
so
they
hold
leads
a
situation
that
might
otherwise
need
a
remedy,
remedy
of
this.
well,
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
held
in
guss
that
the
consequence
of
a
so-called
“no
man's
land”
is
to
leave
conduct
which
reasonable
people
might
think
should
not
be
allowed
to
continue
to
go
unchecked.
now,
congress
squarely
faced
that
problem
in
landrum-griffin,
faced
with
this
court's
decision
in
guss,
and
faced
with
the
rationale
of
the
second
garmon
opinion
which
holds
that
a
state
may
not
lay
its
hands
even
on
unprotected
activity.
congress
tackled
the
preemption
problem.
and
it
dealt
it
with
as
follows.
it
said,
“we
retain
uniformity,
full
and
complete
uniformity
as
under
the
second
garmon
case
to
the
extent
that
federal
law
applies.
but
where
the
national
labor
relations
board,
by
declining
to
assert
jurisdiction,
in
effect
withdraws
federal
law
from
the
field,
then
there
being
no
potential
conflict,
we
allow
diversity.”
the
amendment
to
section
10
(a)
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
demonstrates
that
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
implications
of
this
court's
trilogy
in
the
first
garmon,
guss,
and
fairlawn
decisions.
of
the
second
garmon
opinion,
and
that
it
legislated
in
the
light.
and
we
know
even
more
concretely
than
that
that
congress
took
hold
again
of
this
very
problem
in
the
light
of
that
decision
and
in
the
light
of
its
action
to
amend
this
very
problem
of
what
shall
we
do
with
state
power
to
outlaw
public
utility
strikes.

on
the
floor
of

senate
during

debate.

proposal,

was

which
prohibits
strikes
by
such
employees.
senator
holland's
amendment
was
voted
down.
it
was
voted
down,
if
your
honors
please,
in
the
face
of
this
court's
ringing
declaration
not
once
but
twice
in
the
amalgamated
case
that
if
a
special
category
is
to
be
created
for
public
utility
strikes
or
for
local
emergency
disputes
is
going
to
for
congress
and
not
this
court
to
make.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
oh,
no
your
honor
not
necessarily.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
king-thompson
act
is
one
method,
one
device
of
the
variety
of
devices
which
would
have
been
legalized
by
senator
holland's
amendment.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
believe
so.
it
may
be
argued
that
the
state's
proposal
is
narrower,
because
the
state's
proposal
does
not
come
into
vogue
unless
and
until
there's
a
proclamation
of
emergency
in
the
finding
of
public
health
and
safety
or
effect.
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
pardon
me?
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no,
they're
omnipresent.
the
wisconsin
statute,
for
example,
your
honor
quoted
in
your
first
footnote
of
your
dissent
in
the
amalgamated
case
says
in
so
many
words
and
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
validity
of
the
wisconsin
legislature's
view
of
this
that
a
strike
in
a
public
utility
which
threatens
to
interrupt
the
operation
of
the
utility
creates
an
emergency.
and
the
missouri
legislature
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no,
your
honor
the
chief
--
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
say
no,
because
that
is
not
what
the
chief
justice
in
my
opinion
said.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes
your
honor
i
will
--
i
will
read
it.
however,
let
me
first
point
out
that
what
the
chief
justice
said
that
the
wisconsin
statute
is
not
limited
to
emergencies,
or
to
local
emergencies.
and
he
went
on
to
point
out
that
it's
not
limited
to
local
emergencies,
because
it's
been
applied
to
emergencies
more
than
wisconsin-wide
in
scope.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
and
the
reason
for
that,
he
points
out
in
a
footnote,
is
that
the
statute
has
been
applied
to
a
strike
of
clerical
workers.
and
oddly
enough,
oddly
enough
if
that's
the
criteria,
the
exact
situation
is
present
here,
because
local
8194
of
the
oil
workers
is
a
clerical
use.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
--
your
honor
--
i
--
i
don't
wish
to
disregard
niceties
which
i
regard
as
being
in
which
--
which
are
in
the
case.
but
to
suggest
that
this
court
in
the
wisconsin
case
said
that
the
wisconsin
statute
was
not
levelled
an
emergency
or
that
it
was
not
dealing
with
an
emergency
situation,
i
--
i
could
not
agree
with.
i
cannot
for
myself
overcome
the
fact
that
a
contempt
adjudication
for
violating
an
emergency
injunction
was
reversed.
and
that
it
was
reversed
as
your
honor
pointed
out.
the
question
before
the
court
of
the
amalgamated
case
was
not
whether
the
statute,
as
applied
to
some
national
emergency
or
non-emergency
situation,
is
constitutional.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
court's
opinion
your
honor
is
also
its
judgment
and
decision
and
its
judgment
reversed
the
conviction
of
contempt
for
violating
an
emergency
injunction.
and
the
court
does
hold
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
after
the
language
that
the
appellees
so
heavily
rely
on
in
this
case,
which
points
out
that
wisconsin
is
on
weak
ground
indeed
in
seeking
to
defend
its
exercise
of
power
on
the
ground
that
this
--
that
the
states
are
free
or
should
be
free
to
regulate
in
local
emergencies,
because
congress
dealt
only
with
national
ones.
after
the
--
after
pointing
out
that
it's
on
weak
ground
because
the
statute
is
not
limited
to
local
emergencies,
and
not
limited
to
emergencies
involving
stoppages
either,
although
that
--
not
--
doesn't
in
here.
this
court
went
on
to
say
in
any
event.
and
as
i
read
the
words
“in
any
event”,
they
mean
that
even
if
it
were
not
true
that
the
statute
were
not
limited
to
local
emergencies,
it
would
make
no
difference
because
this
court
was
deciding
in
so
many
words
that
a
state
was
not
left
free
by
taft-hartley
to
assert
its
legislative
power
to
cope
with
public
utility
strikes
that
created
local
emergency.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
i
--
i
attempted
to
make
it
clear
--
i
was
not
saying
that
the
chief
justice
did
not
say
it
was
limited
--
not
limited
to
local
emergency.
he
did
say
that.
but
he
said
it
for
reasons
one
of
which
at
least
is
equally
applicable
here.
and
he
did
not
limit
the
judgment
or
the
reasoning
of
the
court
which
invalidated
the
wisconsin
statute
to
the
fact
that
it
was
not
presented,
that
the
question
of
the
state's
power
to
--
to
deal
with
local
emergencies
was
not
presented.
he
made
the
point
and
one
of
those
points
at
least
is
equally
applicable
here.
i
can
not
say
that
the
case
is
completely
on
all
fours
because
i
have
no
illustration
in
this
record
of
missouri's
applying
the
statute
to
a
multi-state
unit.
that's
the
only
distinction
as
i
see
it
between
this
case
and
amalgamated.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
again
i
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
should
like
only
to
say
that
the
discussion
in
this
field
from
its
inception
pre-taft-hartley
and
senator
taft's
comments
make
it
plain
that
those
people
who
discussed
this
issue
treat
strikes
in
public
utilities
which
result
in
stoppage
of
public
utility
if
ipso
facto
is
creating
threats
to
the
public
health,
welfare
and
safety,
and
is
ipso
facto
creating
emergencies.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
there
is
only
one
other
aspect
of
this
case
which
i
think
requires
comment
at
this
point.
that
is
the
attempt
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
somehow
to
charge
the
union
with
the
acts
of
violence
and
sabotage
committed
by
unidentified
persons
not
shown
even
to
the
strikers
or
employees.
and
while
disclaiming
attributing
their
acts
to
the
union,
utilizing
those
acts
to
transform
a
lawful
and
peaceful
strike
in
which
the
union
exerted
every
possible
effort
to
protect
the
public
against
unforeseen
real
emergency
situations
that
might
arise
by
creating
and
setting
up
emergency
crews
to
take
care
of
calls
from
the
public,
to
attribute
these
admittedly
unauthorized
acts
to
the
union.
this
action
by
a
state
court
itself
creates
and
is
an
irreparable
conflict
with
the
national
act
and
the
national
acts
policy.
for
it's
firmly
settled
under
the
national
act
that
you
cannot
attribute
to
a
labor
organization,
acts
of
violence
or
sabotage
committed
by
unidentified
third
parties
so
as
to
hold
it
responsible
for
them
or
to
illegalize
its
strike
in
the
absence
of
clear
proof
of
authorization
and
ratification
by
the
union
of
the
acts
involved.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes
sir.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
think
there
is
no
question
between
us
as
to
whether
the
state
has
power
in
such
a
situation
to
protect
its
citizens.
the
only
issue
between
is
how?
i
say
that
that
circumstance
does
not
empower
the
state
to
make
the
strike
illegal.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
oh
your
honor
i
--
i
do
not
know
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
where
to
go.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
not
if
telling
the
company
get
--
to
get
back
to
work
means
impressing
its
employees
in
this
labor.
the
--
i
--
i'm
quite
serious.
the
state
has
methods
of
coping
with
this
problem.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
can
take
over
the
utility
for
real
and
for
honest.
it
can
become
the
owner
and
the
employer.
it
can
hire
employees
to
put
the
utility
back
in
operation
and
keep
it
in
operation
if
that's
the
problem.
or
it
can
call
out
the
national
guard
or
its
police
forces
to
apprehend
and
convict
those
responsible
to
the
act
of
violence.
but
it
cannot
say
that
employees
who
have
done
nothing
so
far
as
proof
and
a
civilized
record
or
in
a
court
of
law
would
just,
done
nothing
beyond
exercise
their
rights
guaranteed
by
federal
law
to
engage
in
a
peaceful
strike
shall
forfeit
those
rights
because
some
unidentified
third
parties
have
given
rise
to
a
very
dangerous
and
very
bad
situation,
which
the
is
the
wish
of
the
culprit.
it
can
not
use
these
employees'
rights
under
federal
law
as
the
tools
to
accomplish
an
end,
no
matter
how
legitimate
that
end
may
be
of
the
general
public
of
the
state.
it
has
powers
as
i
indicated
are
the
most
important
facts
in
this
case,
is
the
fact
that
missouri
seizure
scheme
is
a
subterfuge
to
illegalize
the
strike.
if
the
state
of
missouri
had
taken
advantage
of
the
fact
that
taft-hartley
leaves
the
state
when
it
really
is
the
employer,
exempt
from
federal
law
provisions
it
might
have
had
a
way
to
cope
with
the
problem,
if
it
had
honestly
attempted
the
deal
with
violence
pre-violence.
and
this
is
what
it
seems
to
me
is
the
most
straightforward
and
forthright
thing
to
do.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
it
was
stated
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
i
don't
think
that
it's
the
question
of
who
is
operating.
the
question
is,
is
the
state
the
employer
and
on
this
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
has
spoken
and
is
the
state
running
the
utility
on
its
own
account
and
on
this
too
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
is
called.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
your
honor
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
if
that
were
the
issue
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
but
now
i
view
that's
not
the
issue,
because
the
national
labor
relations
act
defines
its
applicability
in
terms
of
who's
the
employer.
if
the
state
is
the
employer,
then
we
don't
have
a
question
of
federal
preemption.
then
the
state
is
free
to
do
as
it
pleases.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
if
you
--
if
i
gave
the
impression
that
all
that
was
necessary
was
for
missouri
to
put
the
public
in
control,
i
misspoke.
unless
you
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
(inaudible)?
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
i'm
not
contending
in
this
case
or
in
any
case
that
the
state
of
missouri
isn't
acting
bona
fide
to
restore
public
utility
service
or
--
or
to
stop
looting
or
to
prevent
acts
that
sabotage
--
i'm
not
concerned
what
its
motive
is.
it
has
no
power
to
enjoin
a
peaceful
strike
by
employees
of
a
private
company
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
amalgamated,
guss
and
garmon,
as
confirmed
by
congress
in
landrum-griffin.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
enjoining
the
violence
and
in
giving
money
damages
against
perpetrators
of
the
violence.
with
this
i
have
no
quarrel.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
--
your
honor
missouri
has
not
passed
the
statute
which
is
restricted
to
the
things
that
we
have
been
talking
about.
as
a
matter
of
fact
violence
and
sabotage
and
so
on
are
--
are
totally
irrelevant
to
the
application
of
missouri
statute.
and
let
me
point
out.
that
the
testimony
about
the
acts
of
violence
and
sabotage
came
into
this
record
through
company
witnesses.
there
isn't
a
scintilla,
not
an
iota
of
evidence
that
mr.
rogers
who
was
the
governor's
deputy
in
this
ever
heard
of
any
one
of
those
acts.
what
brought
this
statute
in
operation
is
incumbent
customers
weren't
getting
public
utility
service.
they
weren't
getting
gas.
that's
the
problem
to
which
the
missouri
statute
is
addressed.
but
again
with
the
question
of
violence,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
where
the
missouri
can
come
into
a
position
of
domination
and
control
of
the
utility.
the
question
is
what
it
can
do
to
illegalize
a
strike?
and
i
say
that
to
illegalize
a
strike,
it
can
do
nothing
as
long
as
it
leaves
the
private
employer,
the
employee
err
and
the
private
employee
is
the
employee,
because
taft-hartley
says
that
it
shall
do
nothing
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
nothing.
if
what
you
mean
is
could
he
enjoin
the
strike
my
answer
is
absolutely
not.
senator
taft
when
he
pointed
why
congress
was
preserving
the
right
to
strike
made
it
clear,
his
statement
is
unequivocal
that
we
reserve
this
right
and
preserve
it
despite
the
fact
that
it
causes
inconvenience,
and
in
some
cases,
danger
to
the
people
of
the
united
states.
and
when
congress
wrote
the
national
emergency
provisions
in
the
taft-hartley
that
your
honor
is
just
well
dealt
with
in
the
seizure
--
in
the
national
seizure
case.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
certainly
not.
for
continuing
the
strike?
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
the
guise
under
which
the
state
wishes
to
assess
the
damages
that
cast
the
statute
the
motive
which
lies
behind
it
is
irrelevant.
the
issue
is
what
is
the
conduct
over
which
it
is
exercising
legislative
control?
if
that
is
a
peaceful
strike,
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
state's
justification
is.
it
can
get
that
power
back
only
when
congress
receded
to
it.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
against
perpetrators
of
violence
i
know
of
no
rule
except
that
they
can
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
who
argue
--
found
guilty
of
violence.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
if
the
provision
that
it
makes
is
that
strikes
in
public
utilities
are
outlawed,
because
of
if
we
let
them
go
we're
going
to
have
epidemics,
my
answer
is
certainly
they
can't
do
it.
congress
they
decided
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
if
congress
was
wrong,
congress
will
remedy
the
situation
by
giving
the
power
back
to
the
state.
pardon
me?
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
oh,
your
honor
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
the
preemption
field
this
court
struggled
through
to
conclusion
with
a
great
deal
less
count
than
is
now
available
to
it
as
a
result
of
the
lack
of
different
amendment.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
oh
i
think
it
clearly
bears
on
this
problem.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
we've
got
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
but
your
honor
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
unions
are
found
guilty
of
violence.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
specifically
said
they're
not.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
i
think
it
--
that
the
state
may
deal
with
violence
with
every
means
appropriate
to
the
treatment
of
violence
except
to
mean
which
illegalize
conduct
protected
by
this
act
and
i'd
make
the
point
--
in
(inaudible).
there
the
state
has
violence.
it's
got
acts
of
violence
not
only
by
unidentified
parties
who
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
union
and
agents'
provocatory
effect.
there
it's
got
active
violence
by
strikes.
and
this
court
says
that
even
there
and
despite
its
conceded
power
to
deal
with
violence,
the
state
is
not
free
to
prohibit
peaceful
picket
even
by
the
very
same
people
who
have
engaged
in
the
violence.
now,
your
honor
if
we
must
distinguish
between
the
kinds
of
conduct
in
that
situation
where
a
man
is
guilty
of
violence
between
whether
the
state
can
enjoin
them
for
further
acts
of
violence
and
enjoining
for
peaceful
picket,
it
seems
to
be
quite
odd
that
you
must
distinguish
in
situations
of
this
kind
equal
between
conduct
--
violent
conduct
for
which
a
union
or
its
members
of
a
strike
are
responsible.
and
that
for
which
they
are
not
and
that
whatever
scope
and
extent
the
state's
power
may
be
it
can
not
reach
to
the
point
where
it
makes
people
who
are
responsible
for
violence
in
consequence
of
somebody
else's
violence
forfeit
their
federal
rights.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
thank
you.
it
has
been
suggested
that
under
the
missouri
law,
that
the
governor
may
return
the
facility
which
he
has
seized
to
the
private
company
when
the
emergency,
which
led
him
to
seize
the
utility,
has
ceased
to
exist.
the
statute
negatives
such
an
interpretation.
it
provides
that
once
the
governor
has
seized
a
plant
or
utility,
and
i'm
quoting
from
paragraph
2
of
section
295180
which
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
45
of
our
brief,
the
last
three
lines
thereof,
“shall
be
returned
to
the
owners
thereof
as
soon
as
practicable
after
the
settlement
of
said
labor
dispute
and
it
shall
thereupon
be
the
duty
of
the
utility
to
continue
the
operation
of
the
plant,
facility
or
equipment
in
accordance
with
its
franchise
of
certificate
and
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.”
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
was
returned
after
the
labor
dispute
was
settled.
now
appellees
said
that
if
missouri
--
i
mean,
if
wisconsin
applied
its
statute
to
this
set
of
facts,
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
because
wisconsin
statute
is
a
compulsory
arbitration
statute
and
that's
all
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
the
amalgamated
case.
may
i
point
out
your
honors
that
the
missouri
statute
has
an
infinitely
worse
impact
upon
collective
bargaining
than
does
the
wisconsin
act.
at
least,
wisconsin
substituted
some
form
of
impartial
determination
by
third
parties
for
its
destruction
of
the
right
to
collective
bargaining
and
strikes.
missouri
substitutes
unilateral
determination
by
the
employer
of
what
the
terms
of
conditions
of
employment
shall
be
and
compels
the
employees
to
work
endlessly
and
without
limit
on
the
employer's
terms
until
they
yield
to
whatever
collective
bargaining
contract
he's
willing
to
offer.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
an
infinitely
great
invasion
of
the
right
of
collective
bargaining
and
far
more
antisceptical
with
it
than
--
then
compulsory
arbitration
which
arguably,
at
least
in
that
case,
was
suggested
to
be
not
incompatible
with
collective
bargaining.
in
bus
employees
case,
amalgamated,
this
court
took
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
congress
had
considered
and
rejected
proposals
to
outlaw
strikes
in
public
utilities
because
those
were
the
places
that
strikes
affected
the
public
interest
worst.
the
wisconsin
statute
declared
in
its
policy
that
any
strike
in
a
public
utility,
which
interrupts
public
service,
and
both
of
these
statutes
alike
dealt
with
no
strikes
except
those
which
did
interrupt
public
service,
created
emergencies
which
were
harmful
to
the
public
health
and
safety.
the
statutes
were
indistinguishable
on
that
strike.
and
in
their
application,
at
least
as
far
as
the
united
gas
case
is
concerned,
they're
indistinguishable
in
the
conditions
that
were
created
by
the
strike.
unless
you
are
to
attribute
to
this
strike,
the
acts
of
unidentified
third
parties.
and
those
were
not
--
and
according
to
this
record,
not
shown
to
be
attributed
to
the
strike
here.
they
are
not
shown
on
this
record
to
have
had
played
any
part
whatever
in
the
governor's
determination
to
seize.
the
first
we
hear
of
him
is
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
burgess,
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
personnel.
in
the
record
in
this
case,
no
such
statement
comes
out
of
rogers
who
was
a
witness
in
this
case
and
who
was
the
one
who
conducted
the
investigation
on
behalf
of
the
governor.
so,
that
there
is
no
distinction,
and
amalgamated
controls
this
case
unless
we
are
to
say
that
this
court's
judgment
in
united
gas,
which
set
aside
the
contempt
to
conviction
for
refusal
to
obey
an
emergency
injunction
predicated
on
the
state's
power
to
protect
the
health
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
against
the
threat
to
their
health
and
safety,
unless
we
are
to
say
that
this
court's
action
in
setting
aside
that
contempt
to
conviction
is
not
a
judgment
of
this
court,
it's
to
be
disregarded,
because
this
court
didn't
quote
the
findings
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
to
which
i
have
referred.
