justice

frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
suggesting
are
you
contending
that
the
concern
--
that
the
king-thompson
act
is
coextensive
with
or
as
extensive
as
the
proposal
by
senator
holland?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
the
scheme
or
accepting
the
strike
but
the
nature
of
the
strike
and
the
nature
of
the
state's
interest.
from
that
point
of
view,
suppose
that
the
holland's
amended
proposals
made
the
king-thompson
act
better?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
that
irrelevant
in
your
eyes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
the
irrelevant,
those
--
those
qualifications?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
chief
justice
in
his
opinion
pointed
out
extensively
that
it
wasn't
an
emergency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
read
what
he
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
first
part
is
what
he
limited
to
emergency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
statute
in
this
term
has
a
provision
that
the
wisconsin
statute
does
not.
i'm
not
saying
those
differences
are
described
here.
but
i
do
think
if
you
are
going
to
argue
in
that
territory
which
is
full
nicety,
with
a
better
regard
to
nicety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
what
i
pointed
out
what
the
court's
opinion
pointed
out
as
well
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
write
opinions
in
order
to
explain
--
in
order
to
explain
the
wherefore
of
the
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
fully
understand
the
argument,
your
argument
that
the
difference
between
amalgamated
in
this
is
not
illegally
permitted
indifference.
i
do
not
understand
denying
that
the
chief
justice
did
explicitly
say,
the
statute
of
wisconsin
was
not
restricted
in
this
statute
in
its
eternity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
distinction
is
in
the
actual
terms
of
the
statute,
although
i
may
construe
that
in
the
practical
fact
every
stop
again
in
utility
involved
an
emergency
due
to
community
dependence
on
the
utility.
all
i
was
suggesting
to
you
mr.
ratner
is
that
the
chief
justice
did
rely
on
the
fact
as
part
of
his
argument
that
the
--
that
the
wisconsin
statute
did
not,
as
a
statute,
deal
with
emergency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
this
happened
here.
we
could
all
read
english
and
there
it
is,
plain
as
it's
possible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
suggested
anything
to
the
contrary
as
you
talked
about
something
very
different
to
mine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
it
have
taken
it
over
and
started
to
manage
it
through
the
--
whatever
the
superintendent
of
works
is
called
in
missouri,
and
after
two
or
three
days
decided
it
would
be
better
hand
if
the
old
officers
would
run
the
utility,
it
could
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
the
section
19
allows
them
to
do
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
the
question
of
running
on
its
account;
it's
a
question
of
getting
it
run.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
had
this
problem
at
the
time
of
the
seizures
of
coal
mines
by
president
truman.
and
this
court
draws
a
lot
of
pages
about
whether
the
government
was
the
employer
or
whether
they
were
the
employees,
and
i
think
its
sterile
talk,
because
the
question
that
that
was
an
emergency
by
getting
mines
running
and
utilities
running.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
question
of
who's
liable
for
tort
and
who's
paying
the
wages,
seems
to
me,
not
very
relevant
to
that
central
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
in
order
--
in
answering
justice
stewart,
you
agreed
as
i
understood
you
that
if
the
governor
of
missouri
thought
the
only
way
to
stop
violence
the
fact
that
there
was,
was
to
put
the
public
in
control.
section
19
as
i
read,
section
19
of
the
missouri
act,
allows
the
governor
to
exercise,
to
utilize
any
agency
for
the
accomplishment
of
that
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said,
in
order
to
stop
the
violence
(inaudible)
--
i'm
--
i'm
--
continuing
with
the
question
put
to
you
by
my
brother
stewart.
looting
--
i'm
not
saying
anything
which
could
place
you
in
that
direction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
looting
or
violence
--
the
governor
could
take
hold
according
to
your
statement
couldn't
he?
couldn't
he
fee
the
mine?
would
he
have
to
see
them
oh
no,
it's
not
very
fee.
he
sees
as
the
mind
in
order
to
stop
that
public
evil.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
case
i
put
to
you.
i'm
not
concerned
either
stopping
the
strikes.
the
court
has
also
said
that
despite
the
taft-hartley
act,
can
deal
to
state
law.
the
state
law
means
anything
that
the
state
under
the
constitution
may
--
may
de-law
under
--
under
those
cases
we've
also
held
it
may
deal
with
violence
either
by
enjoining
or
by
money
damages,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
these
case,
missouri
passed
a
statute
that
says
when
those
things
happen,
the
way
to
deal
with
it
is
for
the
governor
until
that,
the
cessation
of
violence
to
be
the
dominance
of
the
under
card.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
what
--
i
don't
what
the
facts
in
this
type
of
the
show
but
suppose,
suppose
the
governor,
as
representations
made
by
him,
that
the
health
of
the
city
would
suffer
unless
they
get
whatever
gas
and
so
on
would
that
be
--
would
that
--
would
--
could
he
do
nothing
under
amalgamated
in
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
pass
a
statute
both
in
the
company
and
in
damages
or
for
this
--
the
union,
couldn't
they
under
our
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
said
that.
i
said
for
causing
ill
health
and
--
and
epidemic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
talking
about
motive.
it
is
better
that
the
state
can
authorize
the
levy
of
damages
through
violent,
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
a
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
--
that
under
the
supremacy
clause,
it
couldn't
make
provision
by
according
of
epidemic
by
the
same
responsible
people,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
congress
decided
that
and
has
it
decided
almost
anything
else
in
the
whole
preemption
area
except
for
this
in
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
bear
on
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
bear
on
the
violence
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
has
been
left
untouched.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i'm
trying
to
get
your
mind
directed
to
differentiating
the
legal
difference
between
the
state's
power
despite
taft-hartley
to
deal
with
the
violence
and
the
state's
power
to
deal
with
the
causing
of
epidemic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
extent
would
the
decision
of
the
--
of
your
supreme
court
in
this
case
be
binding
on
certainly
the
lower
courts
of
missouri
in
the
penalty
litigations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
relevant
to
the
suit
in
--
in
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what's
the
--
what
bearing
does
that
have
or
would
that
have
for
a
lower
court
judge
under
suit
for
penalty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying,
representing
the
state
that
--
that
they
ask
first
before
you
were
saying,
are
the
--
are
the
present
appellants,
in
the
suit
of
penalty
are
the
present
appellant
making
objections
of
constitutional
invalidity
with
the
penalty
feature
apart
from
their
attack,
their
main
attack
of
the
invalidity
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
you,
representing
the
state,
are
not
suggesting
or
are
you
suggesting?
can
you
say
that
those
claims
are
not
frivolous?
therefore,
since
the
court
would
be,
lower
courts
in
missouri,
would
be
bound
as
you've
properly
said
if
i
may
say
so,
they
would
stop
from
a
--
they
would
start
with
the
legality
of
the
seizure,
wouldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
so
if
the
seizure
was
invalid,
certainly
you
can't
impose
a
penalty
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
starting
with
what
the
lower
courts,
the
lower
courts
of
missouri,
would
start
with
the
validity
of
the
seizure,
are
you
saying
that
there
are
other
issues
in
the
penalty
suit
despite
that
starting
point
were
not
frivolous
in
attacking
the
constitutionality
either
or
both
under
missouri
law
and
for
federal
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
the
foundation
of
a
penalty
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wanted
the
decision
there
but
not
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
that
would
be
popular.

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
follow
just
because
it
is
in
moot
in
the
view
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
is
in
moot
that
according
to
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
i'm
sorry.
please
continue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
these
matters
in
just
indicated
or
stated
explain
for
the
basis
for
the
governor's
action,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
this,
would
the
--
would
the
validity
of
governor's
action
namely
that
it
came
within
the
authorization
of
the
statute
was
that
an
issue
subject
to
court
reviews
or
if
the
court
found
none
of
these
things
that
they
have
found
that
the
basis
for
asking
of
an
injunction
didn't
exist,
but
this
court
has
said
it
in
another
connection
as
they
have
it
i
think,
the
jurisdiction
of
facts
on
the
basis
of
which
he's
allowed
to
move,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
relevance
of
all
the
testimonies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
validate
his
action,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
just
part
of
the
mediation
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
under
your
statute,
the
injunction
doesn't
have
to
persist
as
long
as
forever.
the
injunction
--
the
governor
may
find
the
condition
which
led
him
to
ask
for
an
injunction
of
cease,
and
yet
the
strike,
that
has
to
be
continued
or
resumed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
in
the
statute
and
the
statute
indicates
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
have
to
gas
based
on
this
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
soon
as
the
voluntary
body,
a
court
i
thought
was,
would
determine
how
far
to
extend
its
untruth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
will
do
many
foolish
things
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
wish
is
not
a
matter
a
relevance
to
our
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
merely,
you
merely
agreed
with
me
that
lawyers
ought
to
be
relevance?
