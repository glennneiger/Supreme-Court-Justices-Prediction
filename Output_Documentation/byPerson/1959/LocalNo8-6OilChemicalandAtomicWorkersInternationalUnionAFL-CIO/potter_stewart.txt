from
the
point
of
view
of
a
state's
power
a
--
which
often
goes
under
the
ambiguous
generality
of
the
--
comprised
in
the
term
“police
power”.
is
it
necessary
--
and
we're
talking
about
converting
a
peaceful
strike
into
a
--
into
a
violent
strike.
is
it
necessary
for
the
state
in
order
to
control
that
violence
to
attribute
the
violence
to
the
union?
i'm
thinking
of
this
kind
of
a
situation
in
a
utility
strikers,
let's
say,
an
electric
--
electric
utility,
where
because
of
the
strike
both
parties
responsible
and
doing
party
each
to
the
--
labor
dispute,
doing
its
best
to
prevent
violence.
now,
because
of
the
strike
the
lights
go
out
all
over
the
city,
and
through
no
call
of
either
party,
there's
a
great
deal
of
looting,
crime,
and
violence
of
all
kinds.
now,
isn't
that
arguably
at
least
the
kind
of
situation
which
has
converted
a
peaceful
situation
into
a
violent
situation?
would
that
fall
under
--
on
the
part
of
either
party
to
the
labor
dispute
that
might
arguably
support
the
state's
police
power
to
prevent
and
--
and
to
protect
its
citizens?
justice

well
does
it

like

that's
a
little
bit
maybe
semantics
but

justice

does
it

justice

does
it
empower
the

to
tell
that
company

electricity?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
would
do
then?
justice

stewart
mr.

in
the

in
the
case
now
here
did
the

am
i
right
in
my
understanding
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
expressly
refrained
from
passing
on
either
the

provisions
or
the

or
the
cancellation
of
seniority
rights
in
the

me
ask
you
another
question

this
