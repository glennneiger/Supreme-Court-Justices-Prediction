amalgamated
case
discuss
the

unite
it
independently
to
the
wisconsin

not
quite.
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
was
that
was
there
any
discussion
in
the
opinion
in
the
amalgamated
case

itself

the
inherent
power
of
wisconsin
independently
of
the
statute
to
enjoin
the
--
the
strike
on
the
theory
of
the
united
strike
on
the
theory
that
involved
violence
and
sabotage?
justice
