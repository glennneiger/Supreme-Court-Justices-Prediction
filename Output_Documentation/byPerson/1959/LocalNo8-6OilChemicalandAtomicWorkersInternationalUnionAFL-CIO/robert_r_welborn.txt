mr.
robert
r.
welborn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
as
much
as
this
court
reserves
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
to
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
i
will
first
address
myself
to
the
proposition
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
moot
case.
and
as
much
and
insofar
as
i
am
aware
and
insofar
as
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
considered
the
matter,
the
problem
of
jurisdiction
if
any
seems
to
arise
out
of
mootness
if
mootness
does
exist.
now,
the
facts
of
the
situation
of
this,
this
cause
of
action
was
brought
on
july
the
9th,
1956.
the
strike
(inaudible)
had
begun
on
june
--
july
the
1st,
1956.
on
july
13th,
1956,
after
a
trial
of
some
three
days
duration,
the
circuit
court
issued
an
injunction
against
continuation
of
the
strike.
in
august
1956,
some
month
after
the
injunction
had
been
issued
a
new
agreement
was
entered
into
between
laclede
and
the
unions
here
concerned.
on
october
the
31st,
1956,
the
governor
of
missouri
terminated
the
seizure
of
the
laclede
gas
company.
now
we
say
that
these
circumstances
bring
this
matter
within
the
purview
of
harris
versus
battle
involving
a
similar
situation
under
a
similar
virginia
statute.
we
say
this
brings
us
within
the
purview
of
the
montgomery
ward
case
in
which
the
montgomery
ward
company
had
been
seized
under
the
war
powers
act.
and
when
the
seizure
had
been
terminated
by
the
time
the
case
got
to
this
court.
and
the
held
the
case
was
moot.
the
case
of
commercial
cable
company
versus
burleson
which
involved
the
seizure
of
the
telegraph
companies
in
the
first
world
war.
at
the
time
the
case
reached
this
court,
the
seizure
had
been
terminated.
the
court
held
the
case
was
moot.
the
court
in
burleson,
specifically
refused
to
continue
to
consider
the
case
on
the
theory
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
recurrence
of
such
a
seizure,
which
is
exactly
the
point
raised
here
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
recurrence
of
--
of
seizure.
now,
the
appellants
have
also
claimed
that
they
are
in
jeopardy
that
there
the
seniority
rights
of
the
employees
of
laclede
are
in
jeopardy.
this
strike
occurred
in
july
1956.
this
is
october
1959.
to
date,
absolutely
no
action
has
been
taken
to
deprive
any
of
the
employees
of
laclede
of
any
seniority
rights.
no
action
is
pending
for
that
purpose.
i
know
of
no
action
that
is
contemplated
for
that
purpose.
so,
i
say
that
any
talk
about
jeopardy
to
seniority
rights
is
talking
about
an
imaginary
thing
and
not
a
real
threat.
and
a
court
--
the
court
will
not
consider
the
case
just
to
put
at
rest
those
imaginary
fears
in
the
minds
of
the
employees.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
quite
clearly
and
expressly
declined
to
consider
those
questions
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
mr.
justice
stewart
there
are
no
bonds
at
all
pending
in
this
case.
no
bonds.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
acknowledge
that
such
actions
are
pending,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
however
an
--
in
those
actions
the
defendants
have
filed
the
identical
answer
which
is
what's
filed
in
this
case,
or
for
all
practical
purposes
there
are
identical
answer.
so
that
the
issues
of
the
validity
of
the
penalty
provisions
are
directly
involved
in
those
penalty
suits.
and
they
would
be
i
think
of
necessity
passed
upon
in
the
penalty
suits.
now,
there
had
been
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
in
the
penalty
actions,
a
declaratory
judgment,
similar
to
the
declaratory
judgment
here
involved,
was
also
filed
in
addition
to
the
answer.
and
that
that
declaratory
judgment
was
dismissed
on
motion
of
the
state
on
the
grounds
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
injunction
suit
was
res
judicata
of
the
--
the
questions
attempted
to
be
raised
in
the
declaratory
judgment
suit
in
the
penalty
cases.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
no
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
would
have
no
way
of
predicting
what
a
missouri
court
would
do
or
what
a
missouri
appellate
court
would
do
in
that
regard.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
well,
they
--
it
would
be
binding
on
the
lower
court
to
this
extent.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
it
would
be
binding
to
this
extent
of
course
that
in
the
penalty
suit,
the
same
contention
has
made
that
is
here
involved
that
the
seizure
was
illegal.
and
to
that
extent,
i
am
certain
that
a
lower
court
in
missouri
would
follow
the
supreme
court's
holding
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
well,
that
would
at
least
eliminate
that
issue.
it
would
not
eliminate
all
issues
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
penalty
provision,
because
the
validity
of
the
penalty
provisions
are
also
attacked
on
other
grounds,
that
is,
excessiveness
and
there
are
certain
other
grounds
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
must
necessarily
of
course
be
based
on
the
validity
of
the
seizure.
that
i
would
certainly
concede
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
it
expressly
declines
to
pass
on
the
direct
attack
on
the
penalty
provisions
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
think
it
would
of
necessity
however,
bear
upon
the
penalty
provisions
and
as
much
as
the
penalty
--
penalty
must
be
dependent
originally
i
would
say
upon
the
validity
of
the
seizure.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that
is
quite
possible
yes
sir.
i
--
i
--
i
can
agree
that
that
is
quite
possible,
but
the
converse
will
not
be
true.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
if
the
--
if
the
seizure
were
invalid,
then
the
penalty
would
certainly
go
out
the
window.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
no,
sir.
no
sir
the
supreme
court
expressly
declined
to
pass
upon
it.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir,
i'd
--
i'd
say
they
are.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
obviously,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
would
say
that
there
are
and
that
they
are
not
frivolous
because
they
were
advanced
in
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
the
appeal
of
this
case.
but
the
missouri
supreme
court
expressly
declined
to
pass
upon
it,
and
i
might
say
for
the
sake
of
your
honor
that
there
is
on
file
in
the
in
the
clerk's
office
with
the
record
in
this
case,
a
record
of
the
proceedings
in
one
of
the
penalty
actions
which
was
referred
to
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
record
will
just
bear
out
my
statement
that
there
are
issues
other
than
the
validity
of
the
seizure
involved
in
the
validity
of
the
penalty
provision.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
well,
your
honor
i
--
i
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
mr.
justice
black
that
would
dispose
of
the
case
without
any
question.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that
would
just
--
that
would
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that
would
end
everything
without
any
doubt,
because
everything
obviously
depends
upon
the
original
validity
of
the
seizure
provision.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
mr.
justice
brennan
it
was.
yes
and
you
will
find
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion
reference
to
the
question
of
mootness
which
was
raised
in
the
case
that's
on
page
341
of
the
print
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
would
say
that
they
are
identical
based
primarily
i
would
say
on
the
harris
versus
battle,
which
is
the
virginia
case,
somewhat
similar
to
this
i
would
say.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
no
sir.
the
state
could
not.
amicus
curiae
urged
the
mootness
in
the
missouri
supreme
court.
the
state
indicated
on
oral
argument
that
it
agreed
that
there
was
merit
to
the
claim
of
mootness
but
it
did
not
urge
it
in
its
brief.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
would
not
say
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i
felt
that
in
view
of
the
court's
room
that
i
was
obligated
to
express
my
views
to
this
court
on
the
question
of
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i'm
aware
of
that
certainly,
because
that
is
exactly
what
was
decided
in
one
of
the
amalgamated
cases
where
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
held
the
case
not
moot
but
the
united
states
supreme
court
said
we
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said.
we
will
decide
that
the
case
is
moot
and
it
did
so.
all
right,
i
think
that
is
so
much
for
the
question
of
--
of
mootness.
now,
we
then
get
to
where
i
would
disagree
most
strenuously
as
my
fellow
counsel
in
this
case,
that
is,
what
are
the
most
important
facts
in
this
case.
i
sincerely
say
that
the
most
important
fact
in
this
case
is
not
that
the
state
of
missouri
did
not
become
an
employer
of
the
employees
of
the
laclede
gas
company
after
the
seizure
by
the
state
of
the
missouri.
i
say
that
the
most
important
facts
in
this
case
are
the
facts
that
the
--
which
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
found
to
exist
in
the
circumstances
which
the
strike
had
called
for
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
and
which
evoked
the
action
of
the
governor
of
missouri
under
the
missouri
law.
now,
the
counsel
for
appellant
had
studiously
thought
to
avoid
those
facts.
nevertheless,
they
are
facts,
and
they
are
facts
which
can
not
be
disregarded.
they
are
facts
which
the
governor
of
missouri
certainly
could
not
disregard.
now,
the
evidence
before
the
--
the
court
and
the
st.
louis
circuit
court
showed
quite
clearly
that
every
acts
of
tampering
with
gas-regulating
--
pressure-regulating
devices,
the
result
of
tampering
with
those
regulating
devices
is
that
if
the
pressure
on
the
gas
is
suddenly
increased,
flames
all
--
from
mains
served
on
that
line
if
the
pressure
has
greatly
increased
will
erupt
to
much
more
than
their
normal
size.
there
was
evidence
that
water
had
been
injected
into
the
gas
mains.
there
was
testimony
that
the
injection
of
water
into
the
gas
mains
gives
rise
to
serious
difficulties
and
the
water
may
--
shut
off
the
gas
supply
as
a
result
that
in
homes
the
gas
will
be
--
the
vent
will
be
left
open.
subsequently,
the
water
descends
to
a
low
place
in
the
system,
the
gas
returns,
the
vents
are
left
open,
and
the
gas
escapes
into
residences
or
wherever
the
vent
may
be
left
open.
there
is
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
hospitals
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
relied
upon
gas
for
the
purpose
of
heating
water
for
the
sterilization
of
their
instruments.
there
was
a
evidence
in
the
record
of
a
call
from
a
doctor
who
was
unable
to
sterilize
his
instruments
because
of
the
lack
of
an
adequate
gas
supply.
there
was
evidence
that
a
seal
on
one
of
the
large
storage
tanks
had
been
tampered
with,
threatening
the
release
of
a
large
quantity
of
gas
into
the
area.
there
was
evidence
in
this
case
that
there
was
indiscriminate
dispersal
of
gas
odorant
around
the
city
of
st.
louis.
an
automobile
would
go
by
a
bottle
would
burst
and
the
neighborhood
would
be
immersed
in
the
odor
that
is
used
in
authorizing
gas.
naturally,
this
caused
the
residents
to
fear
that
there
had
been
a
break
in
the
gas
main
and
that
the
gas
was
being
allowed
to
escape
into
the
air
and
also
it
complicated
any
problem
of
an
actual
break
in
the
gas
main.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
the
specific
conduct
mr.
justice
black
was
not
enjoined.
the
conduct
as
such
was
not
enjoined.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
the
injunction
was
against
the
continuation
of
the
strike.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i'm
arguing
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
the
supreme
court
did
not
so
find.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
did
not
so
find.
i
am
arguing,
if
mr.
justice
black
please,
that
these
matters
can
give
rise
to
a
situation
which
endangers
the
public
safety
to
such
an
extent
that
the
state
may
make
use
of
applicable
machinery
to
protect
the
public
in
such
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
--
a
situation.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
well,
of
course
we
probably
get
down
to
the
question
of
when
is
such
action
prohibited
by
federal
law?
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
think
they
were
and
that
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that's
correct.
the
strike,
but
i
think
this
matter
is
relevant.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
oh
i
--
i
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i
am
not
a
--
mr.
justice
but
i
appealed
to
the
jury.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that's
correct.
and
the
--
the
issue
is
to
what
extent
may
the
state
of
missouri,
in
my
opinion,
the
issue
is,
into
what
extent
may
the
state
of
missouri
in
circumstances
such
as
i
have
here
described
now
act
in
view
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir.
act
--
lay
an
act
as
it
did
in
view
of
the
federal
statutes,
and
that
that
is
the
essential
issue
here.
in
other
words,
i
think
those
facts
are
altogether
relevant
to
show
that
missouri
was
acting
under
this
law
here
in
a
situation
actually
of
public
emergency
and
acting
in
a
situation
where,
i
would
submit,
the
ordinary
policemen
would
not
have
been
sufficient
to
have
protected
the
public
interest
and
that
we
have
here
in
missouri
a
law
which
is
designed
to
operate
exclusively
in
such
a
situation
of
public
emergency
and
public
danger
and
that
it
was
so
applied
in
this
situation.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that
is
correct
regardless
of
--
of
who
was
responsible,
it
is
apparent
i
would
say
from
the
record
that
the
threat
to
the
public
arose
by
a
reason
the
existence
of
the
strike.
and
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
no
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
not.
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
no,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
expressly
referred
to
those
facts
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
and
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes,
yes
sir.
on
page
348
of
the
record,
while
the
evidence
is
not
sufficient
to
show
that
the
defendants
were
responsible
for
this
act
to
sabotage
which
helped
to
bring
on
the
emergency,
it
was
sufficient
to
prove
that
there
was
a
serious
and
alarming
interruption
of
utility
service
and
the
public
interest,
health
and
safety
were
jeopardized.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir.
i
--
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
say
that
there's
anything
in
this
record
which
would
attribute
those
acts
to
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
--
the
union
and
their
employees.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i
do
say
that
they
arose
following
the
strike.
and
i
think
must
necessarily
have
been
related
to
the
strike.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that
could
very
well
--
well
that
could
very
well
be
true.
in
other
words,
this
is
in
effect
on
a
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
all
right,
no
i
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
think
to
validate
his
action
and
place
it
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
in
which
this
particular
law
was
applied.
in
other
words,
this
by
law
its
terms,
becomes
applicable
only
when
the
governor
issues
his
proclamation
and
finding
that
the
public
health
and
welfare
are
threatened.
and
i
think
that
brings
us
then
to
the
essential
difference
between
this
act
and
the
wisconsin
act,
in
that
this
act
is
so
limited
and
that
this
act
is
therefore
in
the
nature
of
emergency
legislation,
and
that
it
is
within
the
scope
of
state
power
despite
the
federal
acts.
now,
in
the
amalgamated
case,
there's
no
question
that
the
chief
justice
in
his
opinion
stated
that
the
wisconsin
statute
is
not
--
and
was
not
emergency
legislation.
there
has
been
reference
made
to
the
facts
which
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
found
to
exist
in
the
gas
case
in
wisconsin.
however,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
the
--
the
facts
referred
to
here
earlier
by
--
by
the
--
the
appellant
with
respect
to
the
emergency
situation
in
--
in
wisconsin.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
the
--
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
they
found
this
that
there
was
a
dangerous
condition
fraught
with
the
possibility
of
infinite
injury
to
the
public.
however,
i
say
that
examination
of
the
wisconsin
case
in
the
light
of
this
statement
indicates
that
that
statement
is
no
more
than
a
justification
for
the
temporary
restraining
order
without
notice
which
was
issued
by
the
wisconsin
court.
and
that
the
wisconsin
statute
did
not
require
such
a
finding
in
order
to
call
for
it.
the
provisions
or
the
wisconsin
statute
that
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
they
did
make
the
findings.
and
furthermore,
as
i
read
the
case
in
this
court
and
the
united
gas
case
which
was
considered
with
the
amalgamated
case,
there
was
absolutely
no
word
of
reference
to
the
situation
which
the
wisconsin
court
had
found
to
exist.
in
other
words,
i
find
no
evidence
that
this
court
considered
those
facts
in
determination
of
the
united
case
here.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
that
it
is
because
the
wisconsin
statute
did
not
require
the
existence
of
those
facts.
it
just
happened
--
it
just
happened
that
the
wisconsin
act
had
been
applied
in
this
case
to
what
was
an
emergency
situation.
but
that
would
not
give
validity
to
the
act
which
was
applicable
generally
to
all
strikes
and
public
utilities.
it
was
a
just
a
coincidence.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
to
my
knowledge
mr.
chief
justice
no
issue
has
been
raised
as
to
the
governor's
awareness
of
the
facts
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i
don't
--
i
--
i
don't
--
i
say
that
i'm
aware
of
no
issues
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
--
having
been
raised
in
that
regard.
certainly
the
--
the
validity
of
the
governor's
action
was
not
the
questioned
on
the
grounds
of,
“governor,
you
didn't
know
anything
about
this
--
this
situation.”
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
think
that
i
can
say
that
the
governor
did
know
about
the
situation.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
mr
justice
stewart.
that
is
the
governor's
proclamation
and
that
is
the
governor's
finding
in
the
situation.
now,
we
say
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i
think
that
they
would
have
that
right
mr.
justice
black
but
i
do
not
think
that
they
would
be
necessarily
limited
to
exercising
it
in
that
manner.
i
think
it
would
--
if
the
state
has
the
right,
it
has
also
the
right
to
choose
the
method
of
its
exercise.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir.
but
i
--
i
don't
see
that
the
state
must
have,
well
--
sorry
about
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
well
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
think
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
--
it's
part
of
a
--
it's
part
of
the
statutory
procedure.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
prescribed
at
the
missouri
statute.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
possibly
not
but
i
think
it
provides
a
--
and
orderly
procedure
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that
is
exactly
where
we
return,
yes
sir.
and
that
is
exactly
where
we
get
to
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
amalgamated
case
as
applied
to
the
missouri
statute.
and
that
is
where
i
say
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
well,
of
course
i
would
disagree
with
mr.
justice
black
there,
because
i
think
what
we
have
before
us
here
is
the
validity
of
the
statute
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
--
not
the
validity
of
the
--
injunction.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir.
that's
correct.
and
so
we
have
here
i
think
and
i
think
the
circumstances
of
this
case
demonstrate
that
we
have
here
a
missouri
statute
which
is
an
emergency
statute
which
is
designed
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health,
the
public
safety,
the
public
welfare
in
an
emergency
situation.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i
would
not
disagree.
i
would
not
disagree.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
certainly,
but
then
the
question
is,
can
missouri
go
the
further
step
and
take
the
action
which
it
has
done
here?
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
which,
--
yes.
and
then
the
question
is,
is
it
forbidden
by
the
federal
act.
and
which
brings
us
back
to
the
amalgamated
case.
and
i
say
that
the
amalgamated
case
does
not
control
this
case.
i
say
that
the
amalgamated
case
is
quite
specifically
limited
to
a
situation
of
a
statute
of
general
prohibition
against
strikes
in
public
utilities.
and
that
that
is
not
what
the
missouri
statute
is.
and
that
the
missouri
statute
as
an
emergency
measure
in
the
exercise
of
the
state's
highest
police
power
and
it's
greatest
obligation
to
protect
the
safety
and
welfare
of
its
citizens
that
the
statute
is
not
prohibited
by
any
federal
law.
and
that
it
is
not
actually
in
conflict
with
any
federal
law.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
i
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i
will
go
to
that
right
now,
because
actually
the
--
the
legislative
history
which
was
so
heavily
relied
upon
in
--
in
the
amalgamated
case
of
course
gets
down
to
the
statement
of
senator
taft
as
to
what
the
committee
on
labor
had
accepted
and
what
they
had
rejected
in
the
drafting
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
now,
i
think
if
the
statement
of
chief
justice
has
--
the
statement
of
senator
taft
is
analyzed,
i
think
it
will
be
seen
that
his
statement
refers
to
statutes
such
as
that
involved
in
the
amalgamated
case,
that
is,
a
statute
which
prohibits
strikes
absolutely,
which
substitutes
compulsory
arbitration
or
collective
bargaining,
which
is
what
the
wisconsin
act
did
and
which
is
not
what
the
missouri
act
does.
the
missouri
act
prohibits
strikes
only
in
the
event
of
seizure
to
protect
the
public
health
and
welfare.
the
missouri
act
does
not
impose
compulsory
arbitration.
the
parties
are
left
free
to
arrive
at
their
own
contracts.
there
is
no
feature
of
compulsory
arbitration
whatsoever
in
the
missouri
act.
and
i
think
close
reading
of
senator
taft's
statement
indicates
that
that
is
the
kind
of
act
which
he
was
talking
about,
because
he
spoke
of
a
process
of
the
government
fixing
wages
and
that
they
didn't
want
to
enact
a
proposal
whereby
one
of
the
parties
would
think
they
might
get
a
better
deal
in
the
compulsory
arbitration
which
may
be
provided.
he
was
speaking
of
compulsory
arbitration
and
the
fixing
of
wages
by
government
action,
which
is
not
what
we
have
here.
and
for
that
reason,
i
say
that
that
his
statement
which
is
actually
the
--
insofar
as
i
can
see
the
--
the
essential
part
of
the
legislative
history,
the
taft-hartley
act
that's
here
involved,
does
not
preclude
the
missouri
act.
now,
there
is
reference
in
--
by
the
appellant
and
there
is
reference
in
the
amalgamated
case
to
the
statement
of
senator
taft
that
the
congress
did
not
see
that
to
prohibit
strikes,
even
though
there
might
danger
to
the
public.
but
i
do
not
think
it
be
conceived
that
senator
taft
had
in
mind
danger
of
the
nature
here
involved
and
danger
of
the
nature
which
the
missouri
act
is
designed
to
protect
against.
i
think
he
had
in
mind
economic
danger.
i
don't
think
he
had
in
mind
danger
to
a
person,
danger
to
property.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
what
senator
holland's
proposed
amendment
of
course
would
have
been
as
broad
as
the
--
as
the
wisconsin
act
in
the
amalgamated
case.
in
other
words,
senator
holland's
amendment
was
not
limited
to
emergency
situations.
it
was
a
broad
proposal,
just
as
broad
at
well
frankly
perhaps
to
--
to
invalidate
statutes
such
as
that
involved
in
amalgamated.
but
i
say
we
don't
have
the
statute
that
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
such
as
were
involved
in
the
amalgamated
case.
but
i
say
that
we
do
not
have
the
statute
involved
in
the
amalgamated
case.
and
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
think
that
they
declined
senator
holland's
amendment
which
would
have
created
a
broad
field
of
state
regulation,
mr.
justice
black.
i
do
not
think
that
they
declined
state
authority
in
a
limited
area
and
i
think
that
at
the
last
session
the
remarks
of
senator
kennedy
in
our
position
are
somewhat
illustrative
of
that
fact,
because
at
that
time
senator
kennedy
said,
“i
would
oppose
this
provision
--
this
amendment,
because
it
would
in
effect
provide
a
system
of
compulsory
arbitration.”
so
that's
what
the
opponent
said
that
the
holland
amendment
was
designed
to
do.
in
other
words,
to
invalidate
the
--
wisconsin
act
and
i
say
that
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
our
statute
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
would
correct
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
would
--
i
would
correct
mr.
justice
black
in
this
respect
that
our
statute
does
not
impose
compulsory
arbitration
in
no
circumstances.
there
is
no
compulsory
arbitration
feature
in
the
missouri
statute.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
it
leaves
the
parties
to
arrive
at
their
own
determination.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
and
--
and
work
out
their
agreement
which
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that
eventuality
i
suppose
will
be
met
when
it
arises.
but
so
far
they
have.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that
would
be
possible.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
agree
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
can't
say
what
would
happen
in
that
situation.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
after
these
circumstances
arise.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
no,
no
mr.
justice
whittaker
i
do
not
go
that
far.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
do
not
go
that
far.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i
do
not
go
to
so
far
as
to
say
that
any
strike
in
a
public
utility
must
inevitably
be
a
non-peaceful
strike.
i
do
not
go
that
far.
i
go
--
i
say
that
when
a
strike
in
a
public
utility
does
obviously
and
patently
threaten
public
health
and
welfare
as
this
one,
that
it
is
no
longer
a
peaceful
strike.
but
i
do
not
say
that
any
strike
in
a
public
utility
cannot
be
a
peaceful
strike.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
point
out
to
this
--
point
out
this
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
the
missouri
law
has
not
been
invoked
whenever
a
strike
has
occurred
in
a
public
utility.
there
have
been
16
instances
of
strikes
in
public
utilities
since
the
enactment
of
the
king-thompson
law
in
which
the
state
has
taken
no
action
to
enforce
any
of
the
penalty
provisions
or
any
action
under
the
seizure
--
seizure
provisions
of
the
king-thompson
law
for
the
reason
that
the
situation
did
not
to
the
mind
of
the
governor
involve
a
threat
to
the
public
health
and
welfare.
and
the
missouri
statute
is
so
limited
to
cases
where
the
missouri
--
where
the
public
health
and
welfare
are
threatened.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
do
not
necessarily
say
so.
i
think
that
one
can
counter
up
situations
where
state
power
would
be
permissible.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
well,
to
begin
with,
we
have
here
a
--
a
statute
we
we're
dealing
with
the
statute
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
--
which
is
--
which
is
limited
to
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes.
well,
that's
getting
--
that's
getting
a
feel,
and
i
think
that
there
--
there
could
be
a
situation
where,
in
other
words,
state
power
can
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
its
citizens
is
not
necessarily
limited
to
matters
related
to
public
utilities
insofar
as
labor
relations
are
concerned.
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
missouri,
as
have
a
number
of
states,
have
limited
enactments
such
as
this
to
public
utilities
because
strikes
in
public
utilities
are
much
more
likely
to
give
rise
to
emergency
situations
not
because
they
are
--
but
not
because
emergency
situations
must
necessarily
be
confined
to
public
utility
strikes.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
well,
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
should
never
undertake
to
decide
a
problem
broader
than
that
before
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
it
might
have
--
it
might
have
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
might
have
repercussions
in
the
future?
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
it
--
it
may
--
it
may
extend.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
they
--
they
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
yes.
the
court
could
limit
its
judgment
just
as
it
so
had
been.
i
--
i
agree
with
that,
but
ordinarily
that
is
not
the
function
of
a
supreme
court
in
passing
upon
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that's
all
i
want
to
have
decided
today,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that's
the
one
i
am
interested
in.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
am
quite
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
am
--
i
am
quite
willing
--
i
am
quite
willing
for
the
court
to
decide
the
case.
i
have
thrown
out
my
thoughts
on
the
issue
of
mootness
because
i
think
it
had
--
they
have
some
support
in
the
decisions
of
this
case.
but
i
will
say
quite
clearly
and
quietly
plainly
that
insofar
as
the
state
of
missouri
is
concerned
we
are
willing
to
have
this
case
decided
on.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
am
--
i
am
aware
of
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
beg
your
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
oh
certainly.[laughter]
i
--
i
am
aware
of
that
certainly
and
i
know
i
can
not
confer
jurisdiction
on
this
court
for
my
with,
but
i've
expressed
my
thoughts
on
the
matter.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
--
i
tried
to
be
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
my
--
my
argument
on
the
mootness
question
stands,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
do
not
want
it
understood
that
it
is
in
that,
because
i
fear
a
decision
of
this
court.
let
me
get
back
to
the
--
in
the
landrum
bill,
to
get
back
if
i
may
to
some
area
of
--
of
legislative
history
about
mr.
chief
justice
inquiry.
i
--
i
think
you
can
see
in
the
landrum
bill
that
what
congress
was
talking
was
strictly
these
problems
which
had
arisen
in
the
field
of
unfair
labor
practices
and
matters
of
that
nature,
which
the
--
the
no
man's
land
situation
that
arose
in
the
--
after
the
guss
case
and
related
cases.
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
the
congress
in
that
act
saw
fit
to
indicate
that
the
states
may
have
some
greater
authority
in
that
field
than
decisions
of
this
court
have
held,
indicate
in
any
--
to
any
extent
that
the
congress
necessarily
intended
that
any
other
limitations
upon
state
authority
be
affected.
in
other
words,
they
were
talking
there
about
unfair
labor
practice.
they
weren't
talking
about
the
amalgamated
case.
they
we're
talking
about
the
amalgamated
case
in
--
in
the
holland
amendment.
but
the
holland
amendment
was
much
broader
than
the
missouri
statute.
and
i
say
that
the
--
the
history,
the
legislative
history
i
think
affords
no
basis
for
saying
that
the
missouri
statute
is
necessarily
in
conflict
with
the
federal
act.
i
think
that
to
determine
the
validity
--
the
present
validity
of
the
missouri
statute,
the
court
must
return
to
the
principle
which
it
has
so
often
enunciated
that
state
action
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health
and
public
welfare
is
not
to
be
considered
to
be
abrogated
by
an
act
of
congress
in
the
absence
of
clear
and
compelling
direction
to
that
effect.
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
we
find
no
such
clear
and
compelling
direction.
any
compelling
directions
to
that
effect
must
i
think
go
back
to
the
statement
of
senator
taft
which
was
provided
on
the
amalgamated
case
and
incidentally
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
that
is
the
statement
to
the
effect
that
we
rejected
proposals
for
seizure
and
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
his
statement.
senator
taft
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
oh
the
footnote
21
--
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
in
the
--
in
the
amalgamated
case
the
statement
of
senator
taft
which
was
quoted
by
the
chief
justice
in
the
amalgamated
case,
in
which
he
at
some
length
discusses
what
the
congressional
committee
had
rejected.
and
i
think
it
is
of
some
interest
and
some
relevance
in
the
present
situation
to
observe
that
subsequently
senator
taft
disclaimed
intention
to
extend
the
preemption
doctrine
as
far
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
did
extend
it.
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
the
amalgamated
decision
expressly
i
believe.
he
did
not
say
so
expressly,
but
in
hearings
before
the
labor
committee
on
the
proposed
amendments
to
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1953.
mr.
justice
taft
in
a
colloquy
with
a
witness
who
was
discussing
wisconsin
and
michigan
labor
statute
said
this,
“i
must
say
that
we
never
intended
any
preemption
of
the
field.
the
supreme
court
has
gone
beyond
what
we
intended.”
mr.
robert
r.
welborn
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
say
in
summary
of
the
position
of
the
state
of
missouri
in
this
case
that
this
case,
as
i
think
must
all
preemption
cases
in
this
field,
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
conflict
between
the
missouri
law
and
the
federal
law.
conflict
is
the
touchstone
of
preemption.
so,
we
say,
wherein
does
the
conflict
lie?
the
appellant
says
that
the
conflict
is
clear
based
on
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
amalgamated
case.
we
say
that
the
amalgamated
case
does
not
control
this
case.
we
say
that
the
implications
which
were
drawn
from
the
statement
of
senator
taft
and
which
were
the
basis
for
the
finding
of
conflict
in
the
amalgamated
case
between
the
wisconsin
statute
and
the
federal
statute
do
not
apply.
we
say
further
that
senator
taft's
statement
and
the
implications
derived
therefrom
should
be
extended
no
further
than
the
amalgamated
case.
we
say
that
we
have,
in
the
instance
of
a
missouri
statute,
a
statute
designed
to
protect
the
public
health
and
the
public
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
missouri
in
emergency
situations.
we
say
that
that
is
a
distinguishing
feature,
a
vitally
distinguishing
feature
between
the
missouri
act
and
the
wisconsin
act.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
although
as
appellant
says
in
this
case,
there
was
involved
a
strike
of
clerical
workers,
which
the
chief
justice
in
the
amalgamated
case
referred
to
as
evidencing
not
involving
an
emergency
situation
where
the
wisconsin
acted
that
applied
to
the
strike
of
clerical
workers,
but
this
situation
is
entirely
different,
because
along
with
the
clerical
workers
on
strike,
were
all
of
the
operating
workers
and
also
the
foreman
obliquely.
and
so,
i
say
that
no
significance
can
be
derived
from
the
fact
that
the
strike
here
also
included
the
clerical
workers.
we
say
that
this
is
valid
emergency
legislation
enacted
by
the
state
of
missouri
pursuant
to
its
inherent
police
power,
that
this
court
does
not
invalidate
such
legislation
in
the
absence
of
compelling
direction
from
congress,
which
we
assert
does
not
exist
as
it
applies
to
this
legislation.
and
we
assert
that
the
appellants
have
pointed
out
no
expressed
conflict
between
the
missouri
statute
and
the
federal
law.
and
we
assert
that
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
extending
the
benefit
to
the
states
of
the
right
to
protect
their
citizens
in
emergency
situations.
that
the
state
of
missouri
may
in
this
--
in
the
situation
here
exercise
that
emergency
power
even
though
the
power
is
evoked
to
the
necessity
for
the
--
for
the
exercise
of
the
power
arises
in
a
labor
dispute.
in
the
kohler
company
case
mr.
justice
reed
said,
“the
states
are
the
natural
guardians
of
the
public
against
violence.
it
is
the
local
communities
that
suffer
most
from
the
fear
and
loss
occasioned
by
coercion
and
destruction.
we
would
not
interpret
an
act
of
congress
to
leave
them
powerless
to
avert
such
emergency
without
compelling
direction
to
that
effect.”
we
say
that
there
is
no
compelling
direction
to
be
found
in
any
act
of
congress
that
leaves
the
state
of
missouri
powerless
to
act
in
these
circumstances.
and
we
assert
that
this
legislation
is
valid.
