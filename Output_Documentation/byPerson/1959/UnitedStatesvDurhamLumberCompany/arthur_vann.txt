mr.
arthur
vann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
delighted
that
the
government
has
made
the
argument
that
it
has
because
mine
is
a
happy
chore
today.
i
think
that
on
behalf
of
the
respondents,
whom
i
represent,
that
we
have
the
facts
on
our
side,
the
laws
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
are
on
our
side,
a
very
dedicated
jurist,
judge
johnson
hayes
is
on
our
side
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
likewise
up
until
this
moment.
the
question
involved
in
this
case
appears
to
me
to
be
whether
or
not
a
federal
tax
lien,
the
32
--
3621
creates
any
additional
authority
other
than
the
bank
that
attaches
to
property
and
rights
of
property
or
can
it
divest
previously
vested
state
rights
under
state
statutes.
now,
i
don't
know
about
the
scheme
or
device
that
others
have
referred
to
in
this
cause,
but
it's
been
the
law
in
north
carolina
for
more
than
85
years
that
one,
once
a
subcontractor
or
a
material
supplier
gave
notice
to
the
owner,
it
was
against
the
law
for
the
owner
to
pay
the
contractor.
that
secondly,
the
contractor
himself
is
under
a
legal
duty
and
responsibility
to
furnish
to
the
owner
an
itemization
or
a
list
of
those
to
whom
he
is
indebted.
either
way
once
the
owner
gets
notice,
it's
against
the
law
for
him
to
disgorge
himself
of
the
funds.
now,
in
this
case,
there's
no
question
in
our
mind
about
the
fact
that
the
defaulting
contractor
bankrupt,
as
the
case
maybe,
owes
the
government
some
money.
however,
we
are
seeking
to
ascertain
our
statutory
right
against
the
owner,
not
against
the
defaulting
contractor
and
therein
lies
the
distinction
between
these
other
cases
that
the
government
has
cited.
there's
no
question
in
our
mind
about
that.
mr.
arthur
vann
yes,
if
it
--
mr.
arthur
vann
--
if
it
please
the
court.
we
gave
--
we
have
the
right,
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
it
the
other
day
in
arguing
the
aquilino
case,
we
have
a
statutory
right
in
north
carolina
six
months
after
you
have
furnished
the
last
laboring
materials
to
give
notice
to
the
owner.
you
have
that
six
months
period
of
time
to
do
it.
this
contract
was
completed
on
or
about
july
the
12th,
1954.
mr.
arthur
vann
1954,
when
the
contract
was
completed.
mr.
arthur
vann
notice
was
given
by
the
respondents
in
january
of
1955.
the
tax
lien
notice
was
filed
sometime
in
november
of
1954.
mr.
arthur
vann
prior
to
the
filing
but
within
the
time
allowed
by
the
statute
in
our
state.
now
in
addition
to
that,
the
subcontractors
have
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
upon
which
they
can
go
against
the
owner.
mr.
arthur
vann
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
vann
no,
sir.
he
was
under
a
duty
to
see
that
the
subcontractors
and
material
suppliers
were
protected.
he
could
have
paid
it,
yes,
sir.
he
could
have
paid
it
but
he
would
have
still
been
responsible
to
have
likewise
pay
the
material
suppliers
or
subcontractors,
i
believe,
as
this
the
case
maybe
in
the
cause
of
the
statute.
when
a
contractor
or
architecture
failed
to
furnish
to
the
owner,
an
itemized
statement
of
some
view
to
everyone
of
the
labors,
to
mechanics
or
artisans
afforded
by
him
or
the
amount
due
for
materials
before
receiving
any
prior
to
contract
hence
he
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
so
he's
under
a
duty,
a
positive
duty.
now,
if
he
goes
ahead
and
--
and
pays
that
obligation,
he
simultaneously
has
to
satisfy
the
subcontractors
or
material
suppliers.
it's
our
argument,
if
it
please
the
court,
and
if
you
take
the
colotta
case,
the
white
bear
case,
(inaudible)
and
the
other,
they
are
different
line
of
cases.
they
talk
about
priorities.
we're
not
now
talking
about
priorities.
we're
not
now
talking
about
trust.
we're
not
now
talking
about
court
and
in-court
things
when
in
this,
we're
talking
about
the
rights
granted
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
to
material
supplier
in
our
state.
and
we
say
under
the
state
law,
that
this
defaulting
contractor,
taxpayer
had
nothing
to
which
a
tax
lien
could
have
attached,
absolutely
nothing.
therefore,
it
is
no
question
of
priority.
we
are
going
against
the
owner.
we
have
a
statutory
right
and
privilege
to
proceed
against
the
owner,
not
against
the
contractor,
against
the
owner
after
notice
is
given.
mr.
arthur
vann
your
honor,
i
hardly
--
know
the
laws
in
north
carolina.
mr.
arthur
vann
yes,
sir.
well
i
don't
know
what
it
--
what
it
--
let
me
answer
it
in
this
way,
if
it
please
the
court.
in
the
case
of
schnepp
versus
richardson,
222
north
carolina
228,
justice
barnhill
has
this
to
say.
“the
plaintiff,
to
recover,
must
prove,
one,
his
subcontract,
two,
work
done
and
labor
performed
and
fulfilment
thereon,
a
balance
due,
noted
and
fore
--
notice
to
the
owners
required
by
the
statute
tried
to
the
payment
of
the
contract
price
to
the
principle
contractor
and
if
balance
due
to
the
contractor.”
now,
we
take
it
--
mr.
arthur
vann
schnepp
versus
richardson
involved
amount
due
to
a
subcontractor
and
amount
due
to
the
owner,
i
mean
to
the
--
to
the
prime
contractor.
mr.
arthur
vann
they
were
--
mr.
arthur
vann
the
government
was
not
involved
in
that
one,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
arthur
vann
but
the
point
i
wanted
--
in
--
in
answer
to
--
to
justice
black's
question,
upon
such
showing,
the
law
required
the
owner
to
apply
the
unexpended
contract
price
due
the
--
due
the
contractor
to
the
payments
of
the
amounts
due
the
subcontractors
and
material
men
of
whose
claim
the
owner
has
received
notice
and
here
is
the
key.
the
claim
of
the
subcontractor
or
material
man
supplants
that
of
the
contractor
and
the
duty
of
the
owner
to
pay
is
an
independent
and
primary
obligation
created
by
the
statute.
now,
i
think
that
answer
is
very
effectively
the
government's
argument
that
we
stand
in
the
contractor's
shoe.
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
he
may
well
have
had
something
there
possibly.
we
--
we
don't
concede
that
he
does
because
this
statute
upon
notice
makes
the
obligation
a
direct
one
from
the
owner
to
the
subcontractor.
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
that
may
--
mr.
arthur
vann
that's
what
the
--
mr.
arthur
vann
--
that's
what
--
that's
their
position.
mr.
arthur
vann
all
right.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
sir,
i'm
sorry.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
right
that
which
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
based
their
decision.
and
interestingly
enough
the
same
solicitor
general
who
argued
the
cases
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
colotta
and
white
bear
is
now
the
chief
judge
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so
i
would
think
he
would
advertent
to
these
decisions
because
he
sat
in
that
same
chair
when
those
cases
were
argued
before
this
court.
now,
he
concurred
in
a
majority
opinion
from
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
holds
directly
to
opposite.
mr.
arthur
vann
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
the
law.
mr.
arthur
vann
correct.
mr.
arthur
vann
we
are
perfectly
willing
for
the
government
to
get
what's
left.
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
i
would
not
agree
to
your
conclusion
in
the
matter.
mr.
arthur
vann
of
course,
we
--
we
argue
first
in
--
in
an
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
amount
which
is
owed
by
the
owner
to
the
contractor,
once
notice
is
given,
he
--
mr.
arthur
vann
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
it
-
it
had
been
given
within
the
statutory
period
permitted
to
the
--
to
the
mechanic
and
material
supplied
which
is
six
months.
mr.
arthur
vann
as
a
matter
of
record,
yes.
that's
correct
and
i
would
say
that
there,
you
simply
have
a
conflict
in
them
and
that
the
amount
that
goes
to
the
contractor
comes
out.
you
can't
pay
to
the
owner,
the
owner
can't
pay
to
the
prime
contractor
something
that
he
is
under
law
bound
to
pay
to
the
subcontractors
in
our
state.
that's
not
the
point
in
the
case
of
us
being
up
here
today.
we
are
to
say,
“i
--
i
don't
--
i'd
like
not
to
get
sidetracked
on
the
issue
of
priorities
of
lien
because
it
is
not
in
this
--
this
case
does
not
rise
or
fall
on
that.
this
case
rises
or
falls
on
whether
or
not,
the
subcontractor's
rights
to
go
against
the
owner
or
extinguish
by
the
filing
of
a
federal
tax
lien.”
mr.
arthur
vann
i
think
it's
a
privilege,
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
vann
in
the
essence,
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
vann
as
decided
by
north
carolina
and
not
by
--
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
i
should
hope
it
is.
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
we've
been
doing
it
for
85
years.
we've
maintained
down
there
that
this
statute
been
on
the
books.
mr.
arthur
vann
all
right.
so
now
what
do
you
do,
if
it
please
the
court,
with
the
destruction
of
the
subcontractor's
right
to
go
against
the
owner?
mr.
arthur
vann
--
yes.
mr.
arthur
vann
he
would
but
here,
it's
--
it's
a
direct
statutory
created
right.
mr.
arthur
vann
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
arthur
vann
he
cannot
pay
the
contractor
until
the
subcontractors
have
been
taken
care
of.
mr.
arthur
vann
i
think
most
of
them
do.
yes,
sir,
your
state
also.
mr.
arthur
vann
up
to
that
point,
no,
sir.
mr.
arthur
vann
what
comes
--
what
comes
after
that
has
been
so
able
pointed
out
in
a
very
scholarly
opinion
by
judge
haynsworth
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
incidentally,
the
second
circuit
in
the
fidelity
and
deposit
matter
which
the
government
passed
over
very
likely
the
other
day
in
arguing
this
matter,
held
that
the
balance
due
the
owner
by
the
--
owner
to
the
contractor
was
not
a
property
right
under
the
new
york
law
to
which
the
federal
tax
lien
could
apply.
second
circuit
has
already
held
that.
mr.
arthur
vann
no,
sir,
there
would
have
to
be
a
debt
that
the
debt
is
--
mr.
arthur
vann
it
would
be
a
debt
to
the
--
to
the
contractor.
mr.
arthur
vann
whoever
was
architect
whoever
was
responsible
up
until
the
time
the
notice
was
given.
mr.
arthur
vann
but
after
that,
then
he
has
--
then
the
debt
is
transferred
in
the
--
and
the
responsibility
is
transferred
to
the
material
suppliers,
laborers,
and
mechanics
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
as
i
say,
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
premises
upon
which
i
came
into
this
court
that
the
right
of
the
property
would
have
been
determined
by
the
states
how
they
are
to
be
taxed
to
be
determined
by
this
court
under
the
federal
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
i
thought
that
was
a
premise
on
which
my
case
was
based.
now,
if
this
court
is
going
to
presume,
they're
going
to
the
48
states
and
rewrite
the
statutes,
and
say,
"now,
this
isn't
the
law,
you
don't
mean
that
at
all.
here's
what
you
mean."
well,
then
--
that's
a
different
thing.
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
because,
if
the
best,
if
it
please
the
court,
writes
that
our
people
have
under
the
law
to
come
along
now
and
--
and
say
that
they
do
not
have
those
rights
because
of
a
prior
--
because
of
a
federal
statute
is
in
effect
rewriting
[laughs]
our
statutes.
mr.
arthur
vann
that's
it.
we
reach
a
hopeless
impasse.
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
except
to
say
that
we
--
we
maintain
that
the
rights
of
the
states
to
decide
whose
property
it
is
and
what
the
rights
and
interests
there
are
arising
under
the
statute,
how
they're
taxed,
classification
of
tax,
in
those
powers,
once
those
rights
have
arisen
there
is
a
federal
question.
there's
no
question
about
that
either.
mr.
arthur
vann
it
did.
mr.
arthur
vann
correct.
mr.
arthur
vann
correct.
mr.
arthur
vann
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
arthur
vann
it
may
well
be.
mr.
arthur
vann
our
--
our
decisions
have
held
that,
that
it's
a
--
primary
direct
obligation
to
pay
from
the
owner
to
the
subcontractor.
mr.
arthur
vann
yes,
sir,
there
are
cited
in
the
first
part
of
--
mr.
arthur
vann
yes,
sir.
hildebrand
versus
--
mr.
arthur
vann
yes,
sir.
you
want
the
name
of
this
citation?
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
it's
in
the
index.
mr.
arthur

all
right,
so

mr.

mr.
arthur

at
464.
mr.
arthur
vann
yes,
sir.
schnepp
versus
richardson,
222
north
carolina
at
228,
one
not
cited
in
the
brief
but
holds
this
point,
king
versus
elliott,
197
north
carolina
at
93.
mr.
arthur
vann
king
versus
elliott,
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
vann
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
vann
197
at
93.
i
know
this
court
doesn't
take
much
--
protects
the
right
then
view
of
the
relation
back
doctrine
but
the
king
versus
elliott
hold
as
one
of
its
points
said
when
the
notice
is
filed,
it
relates
back
to
the
point
when
the
work
originally
began
on
the
contract
which
of
course
goes
as
a
matter
of
necessity
in
this
--
in
this.
if
it
please,
the
court,
there's
one
thing
further.
i
--
i
just
probably
have
done
a
very
bad
job
of
trying
to
impress
on
the
court
the
fact
that
in
this
instance,
it
is
our
position
that
the
subcontractor
rights
to
go
against
the
owner
should
not
be
extinguished
by
the
filing
of
a
federal
tax
lien
and
that
we,
in
essence,
are
not
fall
--
and
do
not
fall
under
same
classification
as
do
these
other
cases
where
you
have
priorities
involved,
but
ours
is
right
against
the
owner
and
that's
what
justice
haynsworth
decided
the
matter
on
when
it
came
before
the
fourth
circuit.
the
second
circuit
has
held
almost
exactly
the
same
thing.
you
have
two
other
circuits
who
are
--
mr.
arthur
vann
the
second
circuit
did.
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
they
--
they've
decided
--
mr.
arthur
vann
contract
law.
i've
understand
both.
i
think
the
biggest
reason
the
government
interfere
after
is
about
$46,000
involved
in
--
in
the
fidelity
case
and
--
and
is
exhausted
patience,
you
know,
you
go
to
the
district
court
and
circuit
court,
(inaudible)
i
don't
know
they
brought
a
real
big
case
up
here
on
these
things.
most
of
them
are
minor
matters
which
is
they
didn't
get
a
principle
established
and
where
the
litigant
who
doesn't
have
enough
money
involved
to
make
it
worthwhile.
there
are
two
things
involved
here.
i
represent
the
man
with
this
$3000,
it's
a
substantial
amount
of
money
and
we're
talking
about
simple
justice
and
equity
way
as
equity
in
this
case.
are
you
not
using
money
which
belongs
to
a
subcontractor
to
pay
the
debt
of
a
man
who's
been
dishonest
and
defaulted
in
following
the
laws
not
only
of
his
own
state
but
of
the
federal
government?
mr.
arthur
vann
provided
the
government
has
claimed
to
it.
mr.
arthur
vann
well
--
mr.
arthur
vann
well,
if
the
federal
lien
had
--
had
been
filed
against
the
contractor
prior
to
the
--
mr.
arthur
vann
--
contract
--
mr.
arthur
vann
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
honestly
don't
because
the
--
mr.
arthur
vann
being
consistent
i
have
to
reach
to
the
same
conclusion
probably.
mr.
arthur
vann
that
the
state
law
would
give
them
that
right
under
the
statute
to
do
it
and
i
just
don't
think
it's
extinguished
by
the
filing
of
a
--
of
a
federal
tax
lien
which
simply
says
that
they
have
the
rights,
claim
of
lien
on
a
property
right
to
follow.
we
say
that
they
had
not
had
this
right
to
the
property
based
on
a
north
carolina
statutory
law
and
its
decisions
and
that's
been
sustained
by
the
circuit
--
by
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court.
