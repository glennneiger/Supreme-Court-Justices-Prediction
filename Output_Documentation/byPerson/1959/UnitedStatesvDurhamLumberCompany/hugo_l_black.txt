justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
--
is
that
true
with
reference
to
all
mechanics'
liens
and
every
state
lien?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
have
a
right
--
they
have
a
right
[laughter]
--
they
have
a
right
to
the
mechanics'
lien,
as
i
understand
it,
the
one
which
makes
it
unlawful
to
pay
the
--
for
the
owner
to
pay
to
the
contractor
the
--
what
he
owes
his,
what
he
would
owe
it
if
he
still
owes
something,
if
he
owe
something
as
--
as
the
contractor
goes
to
sub-contractor.
i
presume
they
all
written
up
in
that
form.
it
might
not
be
settle
your
case
but
i
thought
it
was
against
the
law
and
he's
against
it,
that's
what
a
lien
is
formed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
wouldn't
he
have
that
if
you
didn't,
under
any
just
lien
statutes?
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there
had
been
said
that
the
statutory
duty
to
pay,
you
would
still
have
the
lien,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
so
it
is,
so
all
the
liens.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
i
understood
your
court
to
hold
was
is
because
the
statute
says
that
on
account
of
this
lien,
he
cannot
pay
contractor
that
--
that
somehow
differentiates
it
from
the
usual
lien
statute,
is
it
not?
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
think
--
i
think
all
of
them
provide
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
there's
nothing
different,
is
there,
to
that
--
for
the
ordinary
lien
up
to
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
what
is
it
that
comes
after
that?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
there
anything
in
your
law
that
in
your
judgment
says
this
state
law,
in
this
state
there
shall
never
be
a
debt
owing
by
an
owner
to
--
to
someone
else
until
the
subcontractors
are
paid?
is
that
the
way
you
construe
your
law,
that
there's
no
debt
owing
never
has
been,
never
will
be
under
any
circumstance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
debt
to
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
contractor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
provided
some
--
something
hasn't
intervened
in
the
meantime
to
make
the
debts
give
someone
else
a
lien
on
that
day.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
does
have
to
rewrite
the
statute
after
all
if
the
statute
is
--
north
carolina
provided
that
there
should
be
a
lien
under
these
circumstances.
it
says
besides
the
idea
but
the
federal
law
has
already
stepped
in
and
said
there's
another
law
which
so
far
as
applying
to
the
federal
government,
you
can't
do
why
is
that
rewriting
a
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
--
it's
holding
if
it's
held
that
the
federal
statute
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
the
lien
has
validly
vested
there,
valid
--
validly
created
which
the
state
has
to
record.
