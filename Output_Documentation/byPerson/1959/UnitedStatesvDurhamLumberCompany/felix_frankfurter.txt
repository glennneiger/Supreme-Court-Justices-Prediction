justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
heffron,
may
i
ask
you.
i
haven't
read
any
of
the
north
carolina
cases
and
i
rely
on
you
to
tell
me
what
they
stand
for.
today,
it
is
the
trust
fund
in
a
loose
sense
the
way
the
assets
of
a
corporation
or
sometimes
called
a
trust
funds
of
the
creditors
or
do
they
needed
technical
conventional
garden,
common
garden
variety
trust?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
there
are
any
decisions
of
that
you
and
i
are
not
calling
a
common
garden
variety
trust,
arising
under
this
lien
statute.
take
--
take
an
arrangement
which
is
unquestionable,
which
everyone
would
agree
was
an
ordinary
conventional
trust,
what
law
would
have
called
it
a
trust
in
the
technical
sense.
have
cases
arisen
as
to
the
applicability
of
this
lien
statute
when
the
taxpayer
is
a
trustee,
a
non-beneficiary
trustee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
what
are
their
holdings
or
what
is
the
government's
position
regarding
these
conventional
trusts
that
i
call
a
(inaudible)
trust.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
trust
was
in
existence,
you
mean
before
the
government
interest
arises?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
would
you
make
a
distinction
where
the
statute
brings
in
to
being
such
as
a
trust
by
a
prior
existing
statute
but
the
actual
eventuation
of
the
trust
is
--
is
later?
did
i
put
my
question
clearly?
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
under
certain
circumstance
gets
what
you
could
recognize
as
the
conventional
trust
but
the
actual
incident
of
coming
into
being
of
that
trust
under
such
a
settled
statute
is
later,
but
the
statute
is
not
--
not
fairly
be
called
--
suppose
it
antedates
this
lien
provision,
what's
the
date
of
that
originally?
when
did
this
provision
come
into
the
federal
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
the
state
statute
is
the
--
is
10
years
earlier
than
the
federal
statute
so
it
couldn't
be
called
an
evasion
except
by
anticipation,
what
would
you
--
what
would
be
the
government's
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
trying
to
get
some
leg
on
that.
suppose
it
were
one
of
those,
is
there
--
would
you
care
to
state
the
government's
position
or
is
there
one
or
has
there
had
been
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
situation
it
has
arisen
that
all
these
statutes
are,
what
you
call
last
week,
an
--
an
essential's
devices
for
evading
the
lien
provision,
that's
the
way
you
conceive
them,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
avoidance,
i
don't
care
what
they
are
thinking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
true
of
an
honest
to
god
trust
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
mere
--
the
mere
objective
result
that
in
once
that
the
government
would
loose
or
the
government
would
win
can't
determine
the
nature
of
the
respective
interest
or
the
nature
of
the
respective
policies
which
come
into
clash,
can
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
would
set
laws
property
which
he
subsequently
puts
into
a
trust,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
very
different
situation
from
the
one
i
put
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
hold
--
you
must
hold
that
there
was
a
period
of
time
in
which
there
was
what
we
call
property
belonging
to
the
taxpayer
as
to
which
the
government
attached
the
lien
before
the
state,
before
the
subcontractor
or
somebody
else's
interest
arose,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
by
state
statute,
there
was
a
moment
that
the
property
was
in
the
taxpayer
that
instantaneously
a
trust
came
in
to
being.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
whether
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
know
yet
what
the
new
york
law
might
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
there
is,
so
that
you
cannot
say
there's
a
period
of
time
during
which
part
of
the
interest
are
in
the
taxpayer
because
at
the
very
moment
that
a
claim
against
the
contracting
agent
would
come
into
being
instantaneously
trust
shoots
for
the
benefit
of
the
subcontractor,
would
you
have
a
different
situation
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
acquired
property,
to
me,
is
a
very
different
story
from
nonexisting
property
because
it
wants
--
it
--
it's
in
use
of
the
benefit,
wholly
to
the
benefit
of
somebody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
--
but
you
don't
attach
a
lien
to
the
shows-in-action
for
the
abstract,
been
called
the
shows-in-action,
would
attach
a
lien
to
the
money
which
the
owner
gave
to
the
--
was
put
on
deposit
for
the
contractor.
is
that
right?
the
liens
are
attached
to
the
leases
it
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
trouble
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
make
a
lot
of
difference,
to
me,
at
least,
if
the
owner
couldn't
have
paid
to
the
--
to
the
contractor
that
the
money
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
money
which
he
--
which
is
allocated
to
satisfy
the
contractor
and
which
the
contractor
in
turn
may
owe
the
subcontractor,
suppose
that's
--
suppose
that's
a
reason
--
suppose
that's
deposited
in
the
bank
or
in
--
in
the
trust
company,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
that
i,
myself,
can't
paint
with
a
large
brush
in
this
regard
all
such
arrangement,
if
in
fact,
they
are
conventional
trust
like
money
deposit
in
the
form
only
trust
company
in
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
turn
on
what
the
state
law
really
is,
wouldn't
it?
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
not
(voice
overlap)
--
with
north
carolina?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
as
clear
--
is
that
--
does
judge
fuld
make
that
as
clear
about
new
york
law?
he
doesn't
to
my
reading
of
that
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
doesn't
it
turn
in
his
view
as
to
whether
there
is
any
property
--
does
any
thing
would
you
--
i
am
talking
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
turn
on
what
the
incidents
are
under
new
york
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
he
thought
property
in
the
federal
statute
swept
into
it
certain
transactions.
in
short,
he
quickly
slid
to
what
he
thought
was
contained
by
the
term
property
or
property
rights
in
the
federal
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
problem
then
for
me
if
that's
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
i
know
now
what
the
difficulty
with
my
--
what
–
why
i
am
having
difficulty
with
you
where
i
maybe
wrong.
you
go
from
the
result,
from
the
ultimate
objective
result
to
determining
what
the
natures
of
the
incidents
of
the
transaction
are
and
i
first
go
to
the
nature
of
the
incidents
of
a
transaction
to
find
out
whether
the
federal
statute
applies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
can't
do
it
--
by
labels.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
feel
that
too
but
you
can't
do
it
because
the
tax
law
is
full
of
situations
where
would
a
stupe
mind's
constantly
bring
a
thing
on
this
side
of
a
specific
line
and
the
mere
fact
of
the
objective
results
are
the
same
do
not
determine
the
inherent
nature
of
the
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
quite
agree
with
your
statement
that
settlor
can
place
a
trust.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
that
necessarily
mean
that
the
state
anticipatorily
for
its
social
policy
can
establish
a
policy
that
trust
should
come
into
being
under
these
circumstances
even
though
recognition
of
them
supplant
--
would
--
would
not
enable
it
an
exercise
of
government's
lien
creating
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
a
very
thing
from
the
settlor
saying,
"i
now
own
this
but
i
now
which
the
government
can
attach,
i
now
declare
this
a
trust
and
get
it
from
under
the
government's
nose."
justice
felix
frankfurter
mechanics'
lien
still
lives
in
existence
the
property
on
which
it
is
a
lien,
but
an
honest
to
god
trust
is
a
different
order
of
animal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
cover
--
it
doesn't
tell
us
everything
that
is
or
isn't
whether
anything
or
everything
is
or
isn't
specific
of
choate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
break
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
your
notice
in
january
1955,
could
the
owner
has
paid
over
to
the
bankrupt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
when
you
use
--
when
your
north
carolina
decision
talks
about
supplanting
that
implies
a
power
--
of
higher
supplanting.
in
other
words,
that
it
implies
that
the
contractor
had
something
there
and
the
government's
argument
is
it
is
against
that
something
that
a
lien
was
nailed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
that
notice,
the
government
came
in
and
said,
“we
have
a
prior
right.
we
have
an
interest
in
this
fund
to
be.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
government
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
an
interest
in
this
fund
to
be
and
that
fund
to
be
at
that
time
ran
from
the
owner
to
the
contractor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
that
the
issue
of
the
case
is
you
don't
like
to
go
into
priorities
which
is
in
the
way
was
about
but
to
be
more
specific,
if
the
taxpayer
had
property
or
rights
to
property
in
existence
at
the
time
that
the
lien
notice
was
given
by
the
government
then
that
is
valid
and
prevails
over
all
other
latent
possessions
of
power
under
your
state
law,
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
real
question
is
whether,
whatever
property
may
contain,
whether
the
incidents
created
by
north
carolina
law
both
statutory
in
decision,
whether
under
north
carolina
law,
there
was
any
closed
property
and
rights
to
property
in
the
taxpayer
contractor
at
the
time
the
lien
was
attached,
at
the
time
the
lien
was
given
notice
of.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
that's
what
the
controversy
really
turns
on
whether
that
which
whatever
interest
it
maybe
whether
the
contractor
had
an
interest
which,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
is
contained
within
the
concept
or
the
content
of
property
or
rights
so
far.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
north
carolina
can
say
something
is
property
which
--
which
is
outside
the
scope
of
what
the
--
this
court
will
ultimately
say
is
contained
under
the
term
"property"
in
6321.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
property
is
has
to
be
determined
by
federal
law,
otherwise
every
state
can
give
its
own
fancy
notions
of
what
constitutes
property
and
raise
havoc
with
this
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
intercede
north
carolina
litigants
that
the
question
of
whether
uncle
sam
has
something
to
which
he
can
hang
on
an
assertion
of
a
lien
is
here
for
the
first
time,
as
i
understand
it,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
vann,
may
i
pursue
the
questions
of
justice
black
put.
when
the
owner
and
the
contractor
made
a
contract,
there
was
an
undertaking
by
the
owner
and
that
(inaudible)
shows-in-action,
didn't
it,
under
that
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
that
moment,
a
right
went
from
the
owner
to
the
contractor
and
the
subcontractor
wasn't
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
purposes
of
the
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
that
shows-in-action
under
that
contract,
namely,
the
avails
of
the
work
to
be
done
by
the
contractor
in
money
payment
by
the
owner
shifted
that
shows-in-action,
shifted
to
the
subcontractor
as
soon
as
the
contractor
made
an
arrangement
with
the
subcontractor.
thereafter,
under
your
statute,
the
duty
of
the
owner
shifted
from
an
obligation
to
pay
what
he
owed
under
the
contract
to
the
contractor
that
shifted
over
to
the
subcontractor,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
in
a
way,
there's
a
kind
of
ovation
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
giving
us
--
the
chief
justice
have
asked
you
that
too,
would
you
mind
giving
us
a
specific
north
carolina
decision
that
you
want
us
to
look
at
out
of
which
there
arises
legal
situation
such
as
i,
in
a
blundering
way,
tried
to
sketch.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
could
you
turn?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wait
a
minute,
just
one
second,
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
--
i
just
wanted
the
page
of
your
brief,
where
they
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
would
you
just
give
me
the
names,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
get
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
see
it.
