mr.
charles
h.
weston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
which
is
presented
is
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
is
authorized
to
regulate
deceptive
practices
of
a
company
which
does
a
mail
order
insurance
business,
if
the
state
of
incorporation
has
a
law
which
prohibits
a
domicile
insurance
company
from
engaging
in
deceptive
practices
inside
that
state
or
outside
the
state.
the
commission
filed
a
complaint
against
the
respondent
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
evidence
was
taken
and
hearing
examiner
issued
and
initial
decision
and
this
was
appealed
to
the
commission.
it
found
that
respondent's
advertising
was
misleading
in
certain
respects
and
it
entered
a
cease-and-desist
order.
the
court
below
held
by
a
majority
vote,
that
nebraska
regulated
respondent's
advertising
in
other
state
and
that
this
advertising,
was
thereby
regulated
by
state
law
within
the
meaning
of
this
proviso
of
section
2
(b)
of
the
mccarran
act.
the
court
knows
that
that
act
was
passed
to
authorize
state
regulation
and
taxation
of
insurance
companies
free
from
commerce
clause
limitations.
it
provides
that
no
act
of
congress
which
does
not
specifically
deal
with
the
insurance
business
shall
invalidate
or
supersede
any
state
legislation
in
this
field.
the
act
was
passed
to
remove
doubts
as
to
validity
of
state
legislation
which
is
had
been
caused
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
southeastern
underwriters
case.
a
special
provision
is
made
as
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
think
it
did
--
if
the
doubts
were
there,
they
were
removed
i
suppose
[attempt
to
laughter].
as
to
the
antitrust
laws,
including
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
special
provision
was
made.
these
laws
were
not
to
apply
to
the
insurance
business
before
june
30,
1948,
now
there
was
a
moratorium.
by
the
proviso
of
section
2
(b),
they
were
to
apply
after
that
date.
the
proviso
was
before
this
court
in
national
--
in
national
casualty
case,
at
the
1957
term.
the
companies
there
involved
did
business
only
through
agents
and
they
were
licensed
in
every
state
in
which
they
sold
policies.
the
advertising
which
the
commission
had
found
to
be
deceptive
was
shipped
to
the
agents
and
they
distributed
locally
to
potential
purchasers.
the
court
said
that
in
view
of
this
local
distribution,
the
laws
of
the
states
regulating
deceptive
insurance
advertising
unquestionably
were
enforceable
against
the
activity
within
their
respective
boundaries.
and
it
held
that
where
states
were
regulating
this
kind
of
advertising
under
their
own
laws,
it
was
regulated
by
state
law
within
the
mccarran
act
provision.
the
facts
in
the
present
case
were
--
presented
a
very
different
picture.
respondent
has
no
agents
and
all
its
business
is
solicited
by
mail.
it
sells
policies
in
all
states,
but
it
is
licensed
only
in
nebraska
and
virginia.
it
sends
a
series
of
letters
to
prospect
sometimes
as
many
as
30,
including
in
the
letters,
policy
application,
a
policy
application
form
and
advertising
material.
it
issues
all
policies,
pays
all
claims
and
conducts
this
promotion
material
from
its
home
office
which
is
in
nebraska.
the
names
of
prospects
are
obtained
from
its
own
policy-holders
and
it
solicits
only
white-collar
workers,
in
fact
only
white,
white-collar
workers.
the
policy,
which
it
offers,
provides
for
payment
for
the
specified
sum
during
each
week
that
the
insurance
is
disabled
by
sickness,
there's
a
maximum
period
of
52
weeks.
a
state
customarily
regulates
conduct
which
is
within
its
borders.
phrase
regulated
by
state
law
as
applied
in
connection
with
prohibition
of
certain
conduct
would
ordinarily
be
understood
to
mean
regulation
by
the
law
of
the
state
where
conduct
occurs
and
has
its
adverse
effect.
i
think
that
there
is
particular
reason
for
giving
the
phrase
this
meaning
into
the
mccarran
act,
because
its
affect
in
that
act
is
to
withdraw
from
the
public
the
protection
given
by
certain
federal
statutes
to
the
extent
that
state
law
gives
protection.
the
trade
commission
act
protects
the
public
against
deceptive
acts
and
practices
in
all
interstate
transactions.
preventing
deceptive
promotion,
or
sale
of
policies
which
insure
against
some
of
the
laws
covered
by
sickness
or
accident
is
certainly
as
of
much
public
concern
as
protecting
it
against
deceptive
promotion
of
sale
of
ordinary
items
of
commerce.
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
congress
would
not
have
withdrawn
the
protection
of
federal
act
on
the
basis
of
state
protection
unless
the
state
protection
was
given
by
a
law
readily
available
to
the
persons
affected;
that
is
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
insured
lived
and
was
mislead.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
we
think
that
it
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
we
think
--
we
think
that
if
supports
this
view.
the
committee
report
on
the
bill
in
both
the
house
and
senate
said
that
it
was
a
purpose
of
congress
to
secure
adequate
regulation
of
insurance.
section
10
--
this
--
the
proviso
of
section
2
(b)
was
not
in
the
bill
as
passed
in
the
senate
or
in
the
bill
as
passed
in
the
house.
it
came
into
the
bill
--
it
was
introduced
in
the
bill
by
the
conferees
pointed
to
adjust
the
differences
between
the
two
branches.
senator
mccarran
was
one
of
the
three
senate
conferees
and
speaking
of
this
proviso,
he
said
that
federal
legislation
would
not
be
displaced
except
by
state
law
amicably
covering
the
field.
senator
ferguson
was
another
of
the
conferees.
he
said
that
if
a
state
authorized
a
monopolistic
combination
of
insurance
companies
which
did
business
in
numerous
states
that
would
immunize
them
from
the
sherman
act,
in
the
state
of
enactment,
but
not
in
other
states.
senator
o'mahoney,
the
third
conferee,
made
a
quite
similar
statement.
in
other
words,
regulation
by
state
law
which
displaces
federal
statute
is
regulation
by
the
law
of
the
locality.
in
travelers
health
against
virginia,
this
court
referred
to
the
unwisdom,
unfairness
and
injustice
of
permitting
policy-holders
to
enforce
their
claims
against
an
insurer
only
in
some
distant
state
where
the
insurer
is
incorporated.
in
mcgee
against
international
insurance
at
the
1957
term,
it
said
that
if
policy-holders
having
policies
by
an
out-of-state
insurer,
would
if
they
--
they
would
be
at
a
severe
disadvantage,
if
forced
to
follow
the
insurance
company
to
a
distant
state
in
order
to
hold
it
legally
accountable.
in
that
case
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
my
argument
is
irrespective
of
the
constitutional
right
of
nebraska
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
we
raise
--
we
think
that
it
raises
a
--
an
issue
which
might
be
--
maybe
substantial
and
i
was
going
to
leave
that
point
to
the
discussion
in
our
brief,
it
is
discussed
in
the
brief.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
i
--
i
think,
you
mistake
our
position.
in
the
first
place,
we
think
that
general
provision
of
that
regulation
of
insurance
being
the
concern
of
the
states
is
not
the
controlling
factor
under
this
special
provision
with
reference
to
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
trade
commission
act.
thereto
apply
unless
the
state
has
regulated.
now,
regulate,
of
course,
can
have
various
meanings.
what
we
suggest
is
that
the
meaning
of
--
giving
it
the
meaning,
regulation
by
the
state
where
the
injury
is
suffered,
where
the
person
is
who's
--
in
whose
interest
the
protection
is
given
is
regulation,
it
should
be
regarded
as
regulation
by
that
state,
not
by
the
law
of
some
distant
state.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
would
agree
with
you
on
that
and
--
and
that
is
--
we're
not
making
that
contention.
we
are
saying
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
we
--
we
are
not
making
that
argument.
we
are
saying
that
mere
regulation
by
the
state
of
incorporation
does
not
constitute
the
kind
of
state
regulation
which
removes
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
trade
commission
act.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
the
difference
is
that
there
--
effective
had
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
state-by-state
consideration
of
what
they
were
doing.
our
position
here
is
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
certainly
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
i
--
i
would
like
to
mention
that
because
i
think
that
it
--
it's
of
some
significance.
he
was
a
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
when
the
mccarran
act
was
passed.
he
participated
rather
permanently
in
the
debate
on
the
bill.
he
dissented
from
the
commission's
ruling,
jurisdictional
ruling
in
national
casualty.
in
this
case
he
wrote
concurring
opinion
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
he
said
that
what
was
referred
to
in
the
mccarran
act
was
regulation
by
the
law
of
the
state
whose
citizens
are
being
affected
not
the
law
of
some
other
state
operating
extraterritorially.
he
said
that
when
congress
permitted
states
to
regulate
free
from
commerce
obstacles
--
commerce
clause
obstacle,
it
did
not
permit
them
--
permit
one
state
to
regulate
for
another
state.
but
that
is
the
effect
if
nebraska
law
operates
to
displace
in
all
other
states,
a
federal
statute
which
otherwise
would
be
applicable.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i'm
--
don't
have
in
mind
at
the
moment
to
have
the
precise
language
of
all
--
everything
he
says.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
the
--
that
latter
part
would
raise
a
question
of
possible
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
i
said
the
--
the
latter
part
may
raise
the
question
as
to,
the
possible
conflict
were
nebraska
interprets
deceptive
practice
in
one
way
--
nebraska
corporation,
though
its
operating
in
illinois,
illinois
interprets
it
another
way.
but,
i
think
that
essentially
his
position
that
it
means,
the
law
of
the
state
whose
citizens
are
being
affected
and
not
the
law
of
some
other
state
is
sound
and
supported
by
a
legislative
history
as
well
as
all
natural
ordinary
test
for
construing
legislation.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
question
which
maybe
presented
here
and
that
is
whether
respondent's
advertising
is
regulated
by
the
laws
of
the
states
to
which
it
is
mailed.
respondent
has
not
previously
made
this
claim.
it
is
claimed
--
it
--
before
the
commission
and
in
the
court
below,
it
claimed
regulation
only
by
virtue
of
the
law
of
nebraska.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
claimed
even
in
this
court
that
it
is
regulated
by
any
other
state.
its
brief
says
that
these
other
states
are
empowered
to
regulate
and
empowered
to
enforce
the
model
fair
trade
practice
act
against
advertising
mailed
into
the
state
by
an
out-of-state
insurer,
but
it
has
not
said
that
these
laws
do
apply
to
this
kind
of
advertising.
i
think
that
that
rather
ambiguous
word,
empowered
means
simply
that
a
state
can
enact
legislation
regulating
this
kind
of
advertising,
which
would
have
some
measure
of
enforceability
within
constitutional
limits.
now,
the
various
state
attorney
generals
should
know
what
their
laws
provide,
20
of
them
joined
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
the
court
below
by
attorney
general
from
nebraska.
they
claimed
--
they
did
not
claim
that
respondent
was
regulated
by
any
state
other
than
nebraska.
they
have
not
--
a
similar
brief
has
been
filed
in
this
court
and
they've
not
made
this
--
that
claim
in
this
court.
the
claim
is
that
the
state
--
other
states
have
regulatory
power
and
that
the
decision
in
travelers
health
against
virginia
indicates
that
these
states
may
also
regulate.
i
don't
say
that
they
have
regulated.
most
of
the
states
adopted
the
model
fair
trade
practice
act
before
june
30,
1948.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
all
the
[attempt
to
laughter]
or
possibly
all
now
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
but
not
the
district
of
columbia.
this
was
i
say,
has
been
in
effect
generally,
for
some
12
years.
yet
neither
the
brief
that
the
attorney
--
state
attorney
general
had
filed
--
now,
the
brief
filed
by
two
insurance
company
trade
associations
refers
to
a
single
proceeding
brought
by
a
state
under
that
act
against
a
non-licensed
mail
order
insurer.
i
think
that
the
reason
there's
no
claim
that
this
--
this
act
applies
or
no
showing
that
it
ever
has
been
applied,
is
that
it
does
--
it
does
not
apply.
it
applies
only
to
a
domestic
company
or
a
firm,
a
licensed
firm
company.
it
provides
that
any
order
issued
under
the
act
shall
be
enforced
in
the
courts
of
the
state
wherein
the
person
resides
or
has
this
principal
place
of
business.
a
non-admitted
foreign
company
does
not
reside
or
have
any
place
of
business
in
the
state.
furthermore,
this
act
makes
it
unlawful
to
engage
in
deceptive
practices
in
the
state
in
the
conduct
of
the
insurance
business.
the
one
who
engages
in
deceptive
practices
in
the
state
while
conducting
the
business
of
insurance
is
engaging
in
business
in
the
state.
all
states
require
such
a
company
to
paying
the
license,
but
no
state
is
required
the
license
of
respondent
except
virginia
under
its
blue
sky
law.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
the
--
the
mccarran
does
--
does
apply.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
mccarran
--
well,
i
don't
--
what
you
mean
by
the
mccarran
act
applies
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
the
federal
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
i'm
now
talking
about
the
laws
of
the
states
to
which
the
advertising
material
is
sent.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
--
the
respondents
mean
and
i
say
practically
sole
claim
is
on
the
basis
of
the
law
of
nebraska.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
i
say
that
the
laws
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
other
states
don't
regulate
what
comes
into
this
state.
i
say
that
they
apply
only
to
a
domestic
company
or
there
was
a
licensed
foreign
company.
now
in
nebraska
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
certainly
can
deal
with
it
as
far
as
nebraska
is
concerned.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
there
is
that
law
in
nebraska,
but
not
in
other
states
because
my
contention
is
that
the
laws
which
they
have
enacted
apply
only
to
their
domestic
companies
and
licensed
foreign
companies.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
true,
they
do.
but
i
--
i
wanted
to
remove
that
aspect,
if
possible,
from
the
case
so
that
it
would
be
confined
to
the
question
of
the
possible
effect
to
the
nebraska
law.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
now,
we
deal
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
even
if
some
state
should
construe
its
law
as
applying
to
the
mere
mailing
into
the
state
of
policy
application
forms
and
advertising.
that
there
would
be
so
many
obstacles
to
enforcement
that
it
would
not
be
the
regulation
contemplated
by
the
mccarran
act.
i
think
i
will
leave
that
point
to
the
brief.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
they
really
are
a
quite
--
quite
a
series
of
steps,
each
of
one
--
each
of
which
presents
a
substantial
problem.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
i
don't
think,
we
said
we
wouldn't
enforce

i
said
that
there
would
be
question
of
to
what
extent
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
would
require
the
nebraska's
courts
to
honor
a
judgment
issued
under
the
regulatory
law
of
another
state.
and
their
various
--
that's
--
there'd
be
also
various
problems,
question
whether
state
officials
were
authorized
to
go
into
the
courts
with
another
state
to
prosecute
a
suit.

well,
it
would
have
to
be
by
service
by
mail
and
that
would
be
the
travelers
health
against
virginia
question
that
was
decided
by
this
court.
we're
assuming
that
they
could
reach
them
by
mail,
although
there's
no
such
provision
in
the
model
act
itself.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
trade
commission
to
regulate
mail
order
insurance
advertising
has
been
recognized
by
the
industry
itself.
and
it
is
recognized
that
it
has
this
jurisdiction
because
the
states
are
unable
to
regulate
effectively.
the
commission
exercised
this
jurisdiction
by
promulgating,
in
february
1950,
fair
trade
practice
rules
governing
mail
order
insurance
advertising.
an
article
based
on
interviews
with
state
and
federal
officials
and
insurance
companies
and
trade
association
officers
written
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
kansas,
stated
that
this
rules
had
been
promulgated
at
the
instigation
of
the
industry.
an
article
written
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
bureau
casualty
underwriters
says
that
these
rules
were
issued
as
the
out
grow
for
the
general
industry
conference
of
mail
order
insurers.
another
writer
gave
as
a
probable
cause
for
the
adoption
of
the
rules
the
fact
that
the
problem
of
mail
order
accident
in
health
insurance
had
been
a
troublesome
one
for
years
and
the
states
seemed
unable
to
deal
with
it
adequately.
in
closing,
i
would
just
like
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
think
inadvertently,
the
request
made
in
the
conclusion
in
our
brief
is
too
broad.
the
respondent
has
not
criticized
this.
we
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
judgment
below
and
with
directions
to
deferring
the
commission's
order.
it
appears
that
respondent
did
not
abandon
in
the
court
below
its
contention
that
the
evidence
wasn't
sufficient
to
support
the
findings
as
to
the
misleading
affect
of
its
representations
and
the
court
did
not
pass
in
this
issue.
i
assume,
therefore,
that
if
judgment
is
reversed,
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
