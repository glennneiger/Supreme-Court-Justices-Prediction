mr.
weston,
can
you
forgive
me,
if
i
inquire
whether
i
understood
you
correctly
to
say
that
the
reason
none
of
these
statutes
have
been
enforced
against
a
concern
like
this
is
that
they're
construed
not
to
apply
such
concerns,
is
that
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
don't
apply
then
the
mccarran
act
doesn't
apply,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
--
there's
nothing
to
supplant
federal
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
there's
--
what
kind
of
problem
have
we
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
state
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
doesn't
apply,
if
--
if
the
state
laws
have
no
applicability,
then
the
--
the
immunity
or
whatever
you
call
it,
the
mccarran
act
doesn't
come
into
existence,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
no,
no
--
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
you
--
and
you
say
i'll
understand
you,
that
the
nebraska
law
doesn't
regulate
this
activity
of
this
insurance
company,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
doubt
that
nebraska
can
deal
with
this
if
it
chooses
to
enforce
its
law,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
constitutional
powers,
statutory
power,
i
mean
there
are
on
the
books
of
state
statutes
which
can
regulate
this
practice
insofar
as
regulation
can
be
affected
in
any
circumstances,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
received
my
--
my
puzzlement
that
those
other
states
do
not
raise
this
problem
because
there
is
no
supplanting
state
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
well
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
i
can
see
the
argument,
that's
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
--
that
argument
carries
you
far,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
find
it
in
this
field?
