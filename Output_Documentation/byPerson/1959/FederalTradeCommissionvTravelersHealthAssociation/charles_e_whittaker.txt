whittaker
mr.
weston,
why
should
it
have
to
be
--
i'm
just
--
it
seems
to
me,
your
contention
is
that
though
congress
said,
regulation
of
the
business
of
the
insurance
was
to
be
the
concern
of
the
states,
you
take
the
position
that
their
regulation
is
not
"efficient,"
"sufficient"
or
"adequate",
is
that
any
of
the
commission's
business?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
were
these
consisting
--
the
(inaudible)
regulation
by
the
state
is
adequate,
efficient
or
sufficient
(inaudible)
and
is
not
a
question
of
character
judging
the
determination
to
occur
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
weston,
do
you
undertake
the
support
from
the
languages
used
by
chairman
gwynne
in
his
concurring
opinion?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
do
you
support
this
language?
i
think
how
this
section
2
(b)
provision
refers
to
the
laws
of
the
state
whose
citizens
are
being
affected
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
by
the
advertising
of
the
words
and
not
to
the
laws
of
some
other
state,
operating
extraterritorially.
this
protection
by
the
mccarran
act
offer
the
individual
state,
protection
to
the
state
from
the
paramount
federal
power
is
difficult
to
reconcile
with
the
theory
after
making
one
state
subject
to
the
laws
of
another
state,
in
which
laws
they
have
no
part
in
making.
do
you
subscribe
to
that
language?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
didn't
make
any
sense
to
me
at
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
(inaudible)
do
you
really
believe
that
if
this
company
sent
misleading
literature
down
to
missouri
from
nebraska
and
the
missouri
commission
imposed
penalties
upon
them
and
reduced
it
to
a
judgment,
then
sued
on
the
judgment
in
omaha
that
the
omaha
courts
would
not
enforce
the
judgment
here,
as
argued
in
your
briefs,
under
full
faith
and
credit
clause?

charles
