chief

honorable
associate

nebraska
had
a
brief
equivalent
of
a
fair
trades
practice
act,
as
far
back
as
1913,
it's
quoted
in
my
brief,
long
before
anyone
ever
dream
of
south-eastern
or
the
mccarran
act,
or
subsequent
happenings.
the
brief,
of
course,
contains
the
terrific
match
of
nebraska
regulatory
legislation.
nebraska
does
regulate
the
travelers
health
association.
it
does
regulate
the
insurance
business
in
general.
nebraska
gave
travelers
health
association
the
only
light
that
has
when
granted
of
the
charter
in
1904.
nebraska
requires
that
travelers
health
be
financially
responsible,
requires
that
settlement
of
claims
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
the
conduct
of
the
business,
the
conducting
in
a
descent
and
a
high
class
manner.
nebraska
requires
travelers
to
report
annually,
what
it
received,
what
it
paid
out,
what
it's
got
on
hand.
nebraska,
every
three
years,
examines
everything
that
travelers
health
does.
the
state
prescribes
that
what
its
policy
form
shall
contain,
what
policy
form
shall
not
contain.
nebraska,
i
think
its
1948
about
1949,
adopted
a
department
rule,
number
16,
which
is
in
the
record,
requiring
all
nebraska
companies
to
keep
a
complete
file
of
its
advertising
material
available
for
the
convenient
examination
and
checking
of
examiners
of
the
nebraska
insurance
department.
nebraska
joined
with
the
a
large
number
states
in
--
through
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
in
creating
what
became
known
as
the
advertising
rules,
copy
of
the
rules
attached
to
nebraska
attorney
general's
amicus
brief
which
is
joined
in
by
27
other
states
and
i
think
referred
to
in
a
separate
amicus
brief
of
illinois
and
also
in
the
amicus
brief
of
health
insurance
association
of
america
and
the
american
mutual
insurance
alliance.
with
all
due
respect
to
counsel,
i've
lived
with
this
case
for
five
years.
i've
lived
with
the
insurance
regulation
for
about
19
years
having
formally
been
insurance
commissioner
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
i'm
sure
counsel
did
not
mean
to
misstate,
but
in
the
court
below
and
the
eighth
circuit,
we
used
as
second
barrel
in
our
gun,
so
to
speak,
travelers
versus
virginia
and,
of
course,
later
followed
by
the
mcgee
case,
mcgee
versus
international.
so
counsel
misspoke
and
i'm
sure
he
did
it
unintentionally.
nebraska
does
regulate
the
other
states,
in
effect,
in
their
amicus
briefs
have
said
that
they
regulate
the
various
retaliatory
laws
of
states
and
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
having
its
membership
all
of
the
states
of
the
union
plus,
puerto
rico
and
virgin
island,
i
believe,
composes
an
interlocking
or
network
of
regulation
on
a
state
basis,
but
nevertheless
with
a
voluntary
national
aspect
that
really
regulates
this
business.
i'd
be
happy
to
attempt
to
answer
any
questions.
i
rather
deal
with
--
i've
responded
to
counsel's
argument
up
to
this
point
at
least.
