mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
your
honorable
chief
justice
and
justices
of
this
court.
i
think
possibly
in
view
of
the
argument
that
i
might
best
open
my
argument
by
correcting
what
appears
to
be
an
error
which
has
been
injected
during
cause
of
the
petitioner's
argument.
it
has
not
been
argued
in
petitioner's
brief,
it
was
not
argued
below,
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
it
is
not
the
situation
that
this
man
sustained
his
injury
while
going
off
to
pfeifer
two
before
beginning
engagement
in
the
other
work
that
he'd
been
ordered
to
do.
i
would
like
your
honors
to
look
again
at
the
diagram
which
is
on
page
55.
and
you
will
see
by
referring
to
that
diagram,
that
in
the
diagram
there
is
a
little
rectangle
mark
repair
raft,
above
the
repair
barge,
winisook
and
to
the
right
of
that
you
will
see
an
x
in
the
neighborhood
of
where
there
--
is
written
approximately
eight
feet.
if
you
will
refer
to
the
pictures
on
page
56,
you'll
find
a
line
leading
from
an
opening
on
the
barge,
that
line
being
out
along
the
catwalk
tied
to
a
bit
which
is
set
in
a
recess
in
the
side
of
the
covered
barge
at
that
point,
that
is
the
point
from
which
mr.
braen
fell.
at
the
time
that
he
fell,
he
was
in
a
crouched
position
attempting
unloosen
that
line,
in
order
to
pull
the
weight
craft
from
the
position
in
which
it
is
as
shown
in
the
diagram
on
page
55
up
to
the
position
under
the
x
from
which
he
fell
as
shown
in
the
diagram
on
page
55.
and
if
you
will
refer
to
the
trial
minutes
the
record
at
page
24,
at
the
top
of
the
page
you
will
find
that
he
testified
at
this
way.
upon
receiving
the
orders
from
mr.
smith
to
finished
laying
this
deck
on
the
raft,
i
first
proceeded
to
get
the
necessary
hammer,
nails
and
saw
and
other
materials,
up
to
the
door
that
i'm
intended
to
use
which
was
on
the
northwest
end.
after
getting
the
material,
i
proceed
out
along
the
raft
would
be
intention
of
releasing
this
line
and
doing
just
as
i
have
described
to
your
honor
and
the
full
description
of
it
continues
successively
through
page
24
into
page
25
up
to
the
point
of
where
he
slipped
while
you
turn
on,
i'm
loosing
this
line
and
fell
on
to
the
raft.
so,
that
at
the
time
that
he
was
injured,
it
was
apparent
at
the
trial,
it
was
so
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
briefs
of
the
petitioner
and
my
brief
have
developed
or
had
been
developed
upon
the
premise
that
at
the
time
this
man
sustained
his
injury,
he
had
started
to
perform
work
which
he
had
been
ordered
to
perform
this
by
mr.
edward
smith.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
the
work
that
he
was
ordered
to
perform
was
this
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
--
mr.
justice
black.
to
enlarge
that
answer
a
little
bit
to
bring
in
some
of
the
factual
framework,
they
were
repairing
a
pump
on
this
barge
pfeifer
two,
they
had
too
many
men
there
to
do
the
work.
smith
who
is
the
vice
president
of
the
company
who
was
over
there
in
this
yard,
went
down
and
said
to
his
fellow
does
supporting
to
the
--
plaintiff
petitioner's
own
testimony
he
--
you
have
carpentry
experience,
don't
you?
and
he
said,
“yes.”
his
about
i
wish
you
would
go
over
here,
there's
too
many
men
working
on
this
barge,
i
wish
you
would
go
over
here
and
complete
laying
a
deck
on
this
raft.
the
raft
being
the
one
that
i
called
your
honors
intention
to
that's
located
in
the
other
side
of
the
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
deck,
a
decking
or
wooden
decking
on
the
raft.
that
raft
is
weight
raft
that
is
used
around
the
yard
upon
which
man
can
stand
while
it
floats
in
the
water
to
work
on
vessels
of
the
respondent
that
come
into
the
yard
that
needs
minor
repairs
that
can
be
performed
while
the
boats
are
at
float.
the
raft
was
lying
on
the
opposite
or
shoreward
side
of
this
barge
winisook.
now
this
barge
winisook
to
correct
another
error
is
not
a
vessel
within
any
sense
of
the
term.
the
barge
winisook
is
an
old
covered
barge
which
had
been
retired
for
navigation
years
ago
was
taken
over
to
this
yard,
was
wood
with
cables
and
anchors
and
lines
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
could
not
engage
in
any
navigation
even
to
wind
it
or
turn
it
around,
involve
a
lot
of
work.
and
that
appears
in
the
record
very
clearly
at
pages
47
at
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
--
at
the
bottom
page
and
the
page,
yes
your
honor.
page
50
again
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
the
winisook
or
the
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
the
winisook
was
there
your
honor
as
a
machine,
a
floating
machine
shop
and
storage
place.
over
here,
at
this
yard
is
a
small
yard
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
oh!
it
had
--
the
winisook
had
--
had
material
on
it
that
had
been
used
in
connection
with
the
repair
of
the
pfeifer.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
the
winisook
is
used
in
connection
with
the
repair
of
any
of
the
boats
that
come
there.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
in
other
words,
if
they
have
the
machine
on
the
barge,
they
have
a
machine
shop
on
the
barge,
they
--
they
do
it
on
the
winisook.
it's
easier
to
work
from
the
floating
barge
which
is
a
long
side
of
vessels
that
come
in,
instead
of
working
up
on
the
shore.
so,
that
it's
only
major
work
though
it
had
to
be
done
as
for
instance,
in
the
saw
mill
or
something
like
that
that's
done
up
on
shore.
they
have
this
machine
shop
that
can
thread
and
it
can
drill
and
things
like
that
on
this
winisook.
and
then
they
also
store
access
equipment
on
the
winisook.
so
--
so
it's
really
nothing
but
a
--
a
floating
workshop.
that's
all
it
is.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
i'm
not
going
to
answer
your
honor
categorically.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
--
because
i
couldn't
answer
you
on
a
category
from
that.
so,
far
as
payroll
was
concernred,
i'm
perfectly
prepared
to
concede
he'd
never
been
taken
off
that
barge
payroll.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
so,
if
you
say
he's
a
crew
member
from
the
standpoint
of
being
on
the
payroll
of
the
barge
as
a
crew
member,
i'd
have
to
answer
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
--
if
you
--
you
say
to
me,
was
he
a
crew
member
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
at
the
time
of
his
injury
he
was
performing
functions
of
a
crew
member,
my
answer
to
you
your
honor
would
be
that
he
was
not.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
there
was
nothing
in
his
union
contract
that
said
anything
about
one
way
or
the
other.
these
men
do
not
sign
articles.
this
man
who
gave
him
the
order
was
the
vice
president
of
the
company.
he
was
overall
charge
of
all
of
the
employees
of
the
company
so,
that
i
would
have
to
answer
your
honor
that
he
had
authority,
company
wise
to
give
the
order.
now
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
well,
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
your
honor,
he
had
the
--
or
authority
to
give
him
the
order
to
give
them
the
order
to
do
what
he
--
he
told
them
to
do,
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
union
contract
that
said
that
he
couldn't
tell
him
to
do
something
that
wasn't
a
crew
member,
that
it
wouldn't
be
the
work
of
a
crew
member.
the
union
contract
has
been
brought
into
this
case
in
this
way,
and
it's
referred
to
in
the
briefs
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
smith,
when
he
came
on
the
stand,
testified
a
little
differently
than
braen
did.
braen
simply
under
testimony
it
was
called
to
your
attention
page
23,
said
that
he
was
told
to
do
this
and
get
the
job
done
and
he
went
about
to
do
it.
smith
said,
"i
wasn't
going
to
be
able
to
use
the
barge
for
a
couple
of
days."
so,
i
told
this
fellow
i
was
going
to
have
to
lay
him
off
but
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
carpentry
work
and
he
said
yes
and
so
i
told
him
i
can
give
him
a
couple
of
days
work,
laying
this
deck
on
the
raft.
now,
i
put
no
reliance
on
that
testimony
of
smith
at
all.
in
rebuttal
of
the
testimony,
the
petitioner
introduced
the
union
contract
to
show
that
you
would
have
had
to
give
the
man
three
days
notice
of
discharge
in
order
to
fire
him.
in
other
words,
he
couldn't
be
let
go
as
smith
by
his
testimony
indicated
we've
going
to
let
him
go
that
morning.
he
would
have
to
give
him
three
days
notice.
so,
the
man
could
have
refused
so
far
as
the
union
contract
is
concern,
could
have
refuse
to
this
work,
and
could
have
said
to
smith,
"i
wouldn't
do
it,
if
you
want
to
let
me
go,
you
going
to
give
three
days
pay."
that's
the
only
effect
that
the
union
contract
has
here.
but
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
a
question
of
what
it
might
have
been
if
had
been
otherwise
but
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
what
it
is
as
it
happened
and
that
is
the
case
that
has
been
tried
and
decided
and
which
is
here
on
review.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
smith
told
him
to
do
it
and
he
proceeded
to
do
it
and
he
was
engaged
in
doing
at
the
time
that
he
was
injured.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
no.
i
don't
mean
that
he
laid
him
off.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
i
do
not
mean
that
he
laid
him
off,
your
honor.
i
mean
that
the
--
the
question
of
whether
he
laid
him
off
or
not
is
an
absolute
immaterial
consideration
here
according
to
my
contention.
i
do
not
rest
upon
any
claim
of
a
discharge
or
layoff.
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
concede
to
your
honors,
for
the
purpose
of
determination
of
this
case,
that
this
man
was
not
laid
off,
that
he
was
not
discharged,
that
he
was
still
on
the
payroll
of
the
barge
as
the
member
of
a
crew
so
far
as
the
payroll
is
concern,
because
i
say
to
your
honors
that
it's
utterly
immaterial
and
irrelevant
to
the
consideration
of
this
case
under
your
own
decisions
over
all
of
the
period
of
time
since
the
longshoremen
act
was
first
enacted
and
consistently
without
variation
in
at
least
seven
cases
and
where
the
only
variation
between
this
court
or
the
members
of
this
court,
i
should
say
as
to
the
results
reached
has
been
because
of
a
difference
as
to
what
facts
might
inferred
from
evidence
but
not
as
to
a
difference
in
the
principle.
now,
here
is
the
basic
principle
that
has
been
laid
down
on
this
court,
i'm
not
going
to
go
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
he
would
have
to
go
from
the
winisook
down
to
the
raft
in
order
to
do
it.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
he
reached
the
raft
in
the
accident,
not
prior
to
the
accident.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
correct.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
but
your
honor
he
was
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
he
had
not
as
yet
gotten
down
onto
to
the
raft,
that's
right
sir,
but
he
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that
was
the
place
where
he
is
putting
the
planks
on
but
the
doing
of
the
work
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
well,
sure
because
he
had
to
get
the
raft
in
position,
firstly
he
get
on
with
the
raft.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
in
order
to
get
to
the
raft,
he
had
to
put
the
raft
in
position
where
he
could
get
to
it,
to
get
--
get
on
with
it.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
right
sir
and
while
he
was
doing
that
–
unlossing
this
line
to
pull
the
raft
up,
to
get
down
onto
it
that
he
fell.
let
me,
if
i
may,
give
you
(inaudible)
case
that
i
think,
will
illustrate
what
i
am
trying
to
indicate
your
honors
and
possibly
makes
the
situation
a
little
clearer.
suppose
this
same
man
being
the
carpenter
had
been
told
to
go
up
on
to
the
dock,
on
to
the
range
and
to
put
a
shed
on
a
--
a
shack
if
they
had
up
there
were
they
stored
materials
that
have
been
--
they're
blown
away
by
the
wind.
and
he
takes
to
go
up
and
do
the
work
since
he
has
to
put
a
roof
on.
he
takes
the
ladder
that
has
been
used
as
means
of
ingress
to
an
egress
from
the
pfeifer
two
and
which
is
lying
on
the
winisook.
and
he
carries
that
up
to
where
this
shack
is,
he
places
it
against
the
wall,
mounting
the
ladder
and
he
falls
because
of
the
defective
conditions
the
ladder.
he
hadn't
yet
started
to
drive
the
nail
into
this
roof
on
the
shack.
isn't
perfectly
obvious
that
in
that
case,
that
this
man
would
not
be
engaged
at
the
time
of
his
injury,
in
the
work
of
a
seaman
or
member
of
a
crew
of
the
vessel?
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
he'd
be
pretty
close
to
the
locale,
but
i
don't
think
it
he'd
be
closer
from
legal
contemplation
to
a
jones
act
remedy.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
well,
i
gave
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
i
gave
your
honor
a
case
a
little
more
remote
from
that
situation
(voice
overlap)
more
began
accept
my
point.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
right.
that's
really
were
doing
but
remember
it
already
collected,
he'd
already
collected
the
tools
and
the
equipment
to
perform
his
carpentry
work
and
had
them
assembled
and
he
was
in
the
act
of
getting
those
and
himself
aboard
the
raft
to
do
this
work
that
he
was
ordered
to
do.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
no.
i
will
not
conceive
that
it's
that
simple
your
honor.
mr.
justice
black,
i
do
not
make
that
concession.
i
do
not
because
there
had
been
much
that
intervened
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
he
did,
but
he
was
just
--
he
was
just
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
the
catwalk
if
you
look
at
the
picture
on
page
56
--
at
58.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
this
--
catwalk
in
winisook.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that
right.
if
you
look
at
that
picture
on
page
58
your
honor
and
as
you
look
at
the
picture
if
you
will
notice
this
ledge
that
runs
along
the
outside
of
the
barge.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
the
catwalk.
it
really
is
a
very
incorrect
title
for
it,
but
that's
the
way
the
man
used.
it's
nothing
more
than
a
deck
of
the
barge
outside
of
the
housing.
it
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
a
running
between
the
winisook
and
the
railroad
track,
no.
there
is
no
ledge
or
catwalk.
it
is
not
indicated
on
the
diagram
of
--
your
honor
asking
me
if
the
diagram
or
the
picture,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
yes.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
right.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
what
had
been
called
the
catwalk
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
well,
normally
he
wouldn't
be
out
on
this
catwalk
judge,
it's
just
a
point.
it
will
take
you
--
take
five
minutes,
less
than
five
minutes.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
he
was
doing
his
duty
in
connection
with
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
he'd
be
there
to
do
what
he
was
ordered
to
do
in
connection
with
the
raft
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
no
sir.
if
he
was
only
going
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
the
pfeifer,
if
i
may
answer
your
honor
this
way,
the
pfeifer
number
two
was
on
the
opposite
side
altogether
from
where
this
catwalk
was
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
--
that
he
fell
from.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
so,
that
he
had
gone
from
the
pfeifer
over
on
to
the
winisook,
the
repair
barge.
now,
he
had
gone
then
out
on
to
this
ledge
or
catwalk
of
the
repair
barge.
there
would
be
no
reason
for
him
to
have
been
walking
out
along
that
ledge
of
that
barge.
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
him
to
be
handling
the
line
that
he
was
handling
at
the
time
that
he
fell.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
and
he
had
been
ordered
to
go
do
that
work
on
the
raft,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
(inaudible)
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that
puts
him
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that's
correct
sir,
that
exactly
what
i'm
contending.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
what's
that
your
honor?
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
i
think
it's
a
correct
contention
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that
is
what
you're
here
about.
now
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
well
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
oh,
well
i
--
i
quite
agree
with
your
honor
in
stating
that.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
it
enforces
the
law,
i
would
say
your
honor
but
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
no,
i
won't
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
i
wouldn't
say
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
could
take
the
yard
that
could
say
which
is
law
and
which
isn't
the
law
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
i
say
--
i
say
it
to
because
of
the
way
the
question
was
propounded
to
me.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
well
--
i
--
i
tried
if
i
may
[attempt
to
laughter]
the
situation
as
i
claimed
it
would
be.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
the
situation
as
i
think
it
is
in
this
case,
if
i
may
express
it
my
way
now,
is
that
you
have
established
a
framework
of
law,
you
have
established
a
principle
for
determining
whether
in
a
case,
no
matter
what
the
facts
are,
a
man
comes
under
the
jones
act,
comes
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
the
case
of
railroad
workers,
who
frequently
also
come
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
or
whether
he
comes
under
longshoremen's
act.
you
have
said
that
after
the
enactment
of
longshoremen's
act,
the
longshoremen's
act
restricted
and
limited
the
application
of
the
jones
act.
you
have
said
that
it
restricts
and
limits
the
application
of
the
jones
act
to
men
who
are
not
only
seamen
in
the
sense
in
which
you
had
previously
held
men
to
be
seamen
in
the
(inaudible)
case
but
to
men
who
are
acting
as
seaman
and
members
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
at
the
time
they
sustain
injury.
you
have
said
that
the
test
of
whether
or
not
the
longshoremen's
act
or
the
jones
act
covers
in
a
particular
case
is
whether
the
activity
which
the
man
is
performing
at
the
time
is
an
activity
of
a
member
of
a
crew
which
has
to
be
in
someway
related
to
not
direct
participation
in
but
related
to
navigation
in
the
sense
of
the
carrying
on
of
a
vessels
of
its
function
as
a
vessel.
now,
this
man
was
the
member
of
the
pfeifer
two.
he
was
not
a
member
of
any
crew
of
the
winisook
or
the
raft.
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew
of
the
pfeifer
two
and
my
point
very
simply
is
this.
the
facts
here
are
very,
very
simple.
the
whole
fact
picture
here
is
contained
within
three
pages
of
this
record
23,
24,
and
25.
under
that
fact
picture
it
is
quite
clear
and
it
comes
down
to
judging
what
mr.
justice
black
asked
me
a
minute
ago.
that's
how,
when
and
where
this
man
got
injured,
and
i
say
to
you
that
under
the
law
as
you
have
enunciated,
even
in
those
cases
where
you
have
taken
men
who
are
not
seaman,
who
are
not
members
of
the
crew,
who
in
terms
of
their
general
employment
couldn't
by
any
means
of
the
imagination
ever
be
considered
members
of
a
crew
or
seamen
and
you
have
taken
them
by
that
same
test
of
a
particular
activity
in
which
they
are
engage
at
the
time
of
their
injury
and
you
have
said
that
because
an
inference
might
be
drawn
that
that
activity
was
that
of
a
seaman
who
is
a
member
of
a
crew
that
therefore
these
men
who
had
under
no
other
aspect
of
the
imagination
could
ever
come
under
the
jones
act
are
accepted
from
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
and
come
under
the
jones
act.
now,
i
say
to
you
by
that
same
test
that
you
have
laid
down,
you
have
here
a
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
did
correctly,
applying
the
test
which
you
have
enunciated,
consistently
enunciated,
has
held
that
this
man
who
normally
would
come
under
the
jones
act,
whose
general
employment
would
bring
him
under
jones
act,
because
of
the
particular
activity
which
he
was
engaged
at
time,
which
had
no
relation
whatever
to
the
navigation
of
the
vessel
of
which
he
had
been
a
crew
member
comes
exclusively
under
longshoremen's
act,
which
supersedes
the
jones
act
where
it
is
applicable
and
it's
applicable
here
because
this
was
injury
to
a
maritime
worker
on
navigable
waters
who
at
the
time
did
not
sustain
his
injury
in
the
course
of
his
employment
as
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
as
such
and
that
is
what
you
have
said
time
after
time
at
every
case
that
written
on
the
subjects
without
any
variation.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
yes.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
you
have
two
cases
where
it
was
not
amend
with
generally
come
under
the
jones
act
but
a
man
who
generally
would
come
under
fbla.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that
pennsylvania
against
to
o'rourke
and
the
(inaudible)
new
york,
and
hayden
and
harper.
you
have
not
as
yet
had
to
--
to
present
it
to
you
a
case
were
it
was
a
question
of
whether
a
jones
act
man
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
is
--
is
generally
come
under
jones
act
(inaudible)
to
a
longshoreman.
you
just
had
it
in
connection
with
the
railroad
men
who
generally
would
come
under
fbla.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
and
longshoremen
and
after
all
the
longshoreman
act
is
more
directly
related
and
more
directly
supersedes
the
jones
act
than
it
does
the
fbla
where
the
relationship
was
more
remote
than
the
supersedence
if
only
is
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
there
are
cases
where
men
who
have
ordinarily
been
seaman
having
held
to
come
exclusively
under
longshoremen
harbor
witness
compensation
act
where
the
relation
--
the
determination
of
the
--
of
the
seamanship
relation
is
a
little
more
remote
than
it
is
here
where
for
instance,
vessels
had
been
tied
up
for
week
or
a
couple
of
weeks
and
they
said
he's
not
a
seaman,
where
there'd
been
admission
vessels
will
put
them
back
in
the
service
but
there
out
of
service
temporarily
and
they
said
his
not
a
seaman,
desper
against
starved
rock
ferry
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
--
one
that
you
had
in
this
court,
but
not
one
where
it's
quite
and
close
in
time
as
it
is
here.
the
nearest,
for
the
closest
of
time
the
shifting
back
and
forth
of
the
rights
under
the
one
statute
and
the
other,
under
fbla
or
longshoremen
question
as
to
(inaudible)
and
pennsylvania
against
o'rourke
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
many
differences,
time
has
nothing
to
do
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
that
will
depend
upon
the
work
that
he
was
doing
judge
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
under
your
honors
assumption
now,
those
facts
as
your
honor
assume,
i
say
he
would
not
come
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
because
you
have
said
in
o'donnell
--
you've
said
in
the
o'donnell
case
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
--
and
you
--
you've
said
it
a
couple
of
times
that
the
place
of
work
is
not
yet
involve
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
the
reason
he'd
been
working
on
shore
and
still
come
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
so,
similarly
be
working
on
the
ship
and
not
come
under.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
now,
i
haven't
had
time
to
address
myself
to
the
--
may
be
couple
of
minutes
for
the
question
of
the
request
to
charge
but
i
as
argued
in
the
briefs
and
they
are
set
forth
at
the
page
11,
and
the
charge
of
the
court
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
--
is
set
forth
at
page
5
and
if
you
will
compare
the
request
to
the
charge
of
page
5,
where
you
see
that
the
court
gave
no
test
at
all,
the
court
just
said
that
this
--
apparently
the
seaman,
the
member
of
the
crew,
i
don't
think
we'd
much
question
about
it
but
he
told
you
what
kind
of
work
he
did
before
and
then
he
went
on
to
charge
a
negligence.
there
was
no
charge
at
all
really.
i
--
i
give
him
four
requests,
i'm
not
trying
to
hold
each
one
of
them
individually,
there
weren't
given
as
individual
requests,
they
were
given
as
a
series
of
requests
forming
a
complete
context
that
suited
in
this
case
and
the
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
said
even
though
dissented
on
the
other
feature,
unanimously
said
that
if
you
could
reverse
then
send
it
back
for
a
new
trail
in
any
event
because
there
was
no
fair
charge
on
the
--
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
oh,
definitely
judge
and
not
only
that,
i
accepted
to
that
and
he
corrected
that
later
on.
mr.
edmund
f.
lamb
they
didn't
give
me
any
of
my
charges
judge
and
you'll
find
them
all
at
page
11
and
you'll
find
where
i
accepted
to
that
statement
at
the
page
10.
and
the
court
corrected
himself
but
i
think
the
correction
didn't
really
accomplish
anything.
thank
you
sir.
