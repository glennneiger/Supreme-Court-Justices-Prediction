justice
hugo

black
would
you
go
and
give
depending
on
the
fact
that
the
little
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
he
was
ordered
to
go
to
work
pudeck
planks?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
he
have
to
do
this
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
have
to
do
the
work
on
the
raft?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
reach
the
raft?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
fell
on
to
the
raft?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
not
yet
gotten
to
the
place
where
he
was
to
do
the
work
by
putting
the
deck
planks
on
dock?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
asking
you
that
as
to
the
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
was
the
place
he
was
to
do
the
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
ordered
to
do
in
anything
besides
put
the
planks
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
place
of
getting
to
--
in
order
to
get
away
he
was
do
the
work,
he
had
to
get
away
he
could
do
the
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
was
on
the
raft?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he'd
be
pretty
close
to
both
places,
wouldn't,
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
had
been
a
ladder
took
from
the
wings
of
wines
--
winisook,
whatever
it
is,
down
to
the
raft
and
he'd
been
ordered
to
go
to
the
raft
to
do
the
work,
you're
saying
that
he
was
in
the
same
situation
as
he
had
been,
if
he
reached
that
ladder,
the
ladder
will
rotten
and
broken.
you
say
that
he
would
not
have
been
than
a
mate
and
was
not
had
been
entitled
to
recover
as
a
member
of
crew.

(inaudible)
book?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
this
one.
as
i
understand
it,
he
was
on
his
way
not
by
way
of
a
ladder
from
the
winisook
to
the
raft,
but
he
was
going
there
and
try
to
pull
up
it
up
to
it,
so
he
could
get
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
according
to
your
argument
as
i
understand,
you're
walking
from
the
job
as
a
mate
towards
his
job
as
whatever
that
was
that
was
not
a
mate
--
not
a
member
of
a
crew
and
on
his
way
he
fell
onto
the
place
where
he
was
to
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
the
winisook
(voice
overlap),
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
winisook.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
it
takes
to
go
from
the
--
normally
from
the
pfeifer
to
the
catwalk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
--
was
he
doing
his
duty
when
he
was
on
the
catwalk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
he
would
be
there
to
do
what
he
was
ordered
to
do,
when
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
in
connection
with
(inaudible).
i'm
talking
about
is
--
to
go
from
the
parts
to
the
raft,
he
was
going
the
right
way,
wasn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
mean,
the
duty
â€“
the
job
he
was
going
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
had
been
ordered
to
go
to
do
the
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you're
saying
is
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
has
to
defend
as
a
matter
--
you
have
to
defend
it,
right,
it
has
been
found
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
when
he
walked
from
there
--
from
the
pfeifer
or
to
the
winisook
catwalk,
and
before
he
fell
on
it,
he
was
at
that
time
as
a
matter
of
law,
no
longer
engaged
in
any
duty
as
mate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
therefore,
it
puts
him
on
to
the
other
hand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
where
you
could
have
found
it
as
a
matter
of
law?
does
it
find
the
--
does
it
find
the
law
or
suppose
to
enforce
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
maybe
unfamiliar
to
say
that
i
think
you
answered
it
correctly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
your
argument
be
any
difference
if
when
this
man
had
been
told
to
go
home
to
that,
to
do
this
on
the
plank,
he'd
been
told
now
you
could
only
be
there
five
minutes,
you
come
back
after
five
minutes,
your
argument
would
be
any
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
looking
at
the
court's
charge
here
it
says
that
not
seemed
to
be
seriously
disputed,
do
you
remember
the
crew?
did
you
ask
a
charge
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
was
the
charge
that
they
didn't
give
you?
