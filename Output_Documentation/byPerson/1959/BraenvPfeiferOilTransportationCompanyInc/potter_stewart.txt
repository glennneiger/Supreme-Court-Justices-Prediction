justice
potter
stewart
the
winisook
and
raft
as
well
as
the
pfeifer
number
two
were
all
own
by
the
respondent?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
seiff
to
pursue
justice
whittaker's
inquiry
a
little
further,
what
if
have
he
--
been
or
the
shore
or
on
a
ship's
business
instead
of
get
some
provisions
and
was
being
driven
on
the
street,
on
one
the
way
to
the
grocery
store
by
a
chauffeur
employed
by
the
employer,
driving
a
truck
or
station
wagon
and
because
of
that
agent's
negligence
they
got
into
an
automobile
accident
and
this
fellow
was
injured,
would
he
--
would
he
be
entitled
by
the
jones
act?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
place
of
injury
is
irrelevant
for
this
preposition?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
assuming
there
is
negligence.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lamb,
i'm
familiar
of
course
with
the
general
cases
you've
been
referring
to
in
which
this
court,
another
courts
had
held
that,
first
the
general
employment
is
not
that
of
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
can
--
hope
become
one.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
many
cases
so
holding
and
most
of
them
say
this
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
trier
for
facts.
are
there
any
cases
in
this
court
involving
precisely
this
kind
of
a
situation
where
a
person
whose
general
employment
admittedly
was
that
of
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
who
is
ever
held
not
to
be
subject
to
the
--
not
to
be
entitled
to
invoke
the
jones
act?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
pennsylvania
against
to
o'rourke,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
who
would
generally
be
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
between
fbla
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
any
case
like
this
in
the
courts
of
appeals
or
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
