mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
jones
act
case,
the
petitioner
had
obtained
a
jury
verdict
in
the
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
it
was
undisputed
that
he
was
a
seaman
and
had
been
a
seaman
for
some
four
months
prior
to
the
accident.
it
was
undisputed
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
crew
and
that
had
--
had
been
such
for
--
four
months
prior
to
the
accident.
it
was
also
undisputed
that
he
was
injured
while
performing
work
that
his
superiors
had
ordered
him
to
do,
and
it
was
undisputed
that
the
injury
occurred
aboard
of
vessel
that
was
own
by
his
employer
and
where
you
had
to
be
in
order
to
perform
what
he
had
been
commanded
to
perform
and
it
is
also
undisputed
that
it
was
a
negligent
maintenance
of
the
vessel
that
had
caused
his
injury.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
dismissed
his
action
on
a
ground
that
the
nature
of
the
work
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
do
was
such
as
to
--
as
to
--
as
a
matter
of
law,
hold
--
or
that
the
injury
that
he
sustained
was
not
in
the
course
of
his
employment
as
a
member
of
the
crew
and
as
a
seaman.
in
other
words,
the
case
presents
the
reverse
of
the
usual
situation
where
a
person
not
in
general
maritime
employment
claims
that
--
he
has
become
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
the
crew
when
injured
by
reason
of
the
nature
of
the
work
he
was
doing.
in
this
case,
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
the
crew
is
held
to
be
disestablished
on
status
by
reason
of
the
nature
of
the
work
that
he'd
been
ordered
to
do.
and
the
basic
question
in
this
case
is
what
ingredient
was
there
in
this
work
that
as
a
matter
of
law
vitiated
his
jones
act
remedy?
now,
the
facts
briefly
are
these.
the
respondent
was
in
a
business
of
transporting
petroleum
products
by
oil
--
the
by
barges
and
tows
and
vessels
of
that
kind
and
one
of
its
vessels
was
a
barge
by
the
name
of
pfeifer
number
two.
it
had
a
crew
of
three
and
the
petitioner
was
a
mate
aboard
of
vessel
and
had
been
a
mate
for
some
four
months
prior
to
the
accident.
his
duties
were
various,
they
included
handling
the
lines
and
the
cables,
loading
and
unloading,
hamming
the
hose,
preparing
food,
setting
up
navigation
lights,
and
included
among
his
duties
was
also
a
duty
of
maintaining
the
barge
which
involved
painting,
scraping
and
as
was
called
minor
repairs,
defined
as
with
pairs
which
required
two
men,
no
more
than
two
men
to
perform.
about
two
days
before
the
accident,
one
the
pumps
of
the
vessel
had
become
out
of
order
and
the
vessel
was
ordered
to
the
repair
yard
of
the
respondent
in
west
--
in
new
and
the
west
new
brighton,
staten
island.
the
defendant
or
rather
the
respondent
maintained
at
that
yard
a
floating
repair
barge
called
the
winisook,
which
was
secure
to
dock
by
cables
and
lines.
now,
between
the
dock
and
the
winisook,
the
respondent
maintained
a
further
facility,
a
floating
raft.
this
raft
is
used
by
the
respondent
for
the
chipping,
and
painting,
and
repair
work
of
such
of
its
vessels
as
needed
to
such
to
work
to
be
done
at
such
time
when
it
was
needed.
and
when
the
pfeifer
number
two
arrived,
it
was
moored
at
the
open
water
side
of
the
winisook
so
you
have
this
situation.
here
was
a
dock,
the
raft,
the
winisook,
the
pfeifer
number
two
and
it
was
conceded
that
in
order
for
any
crew
men
of
the
pfeifer
number
two
to
get
--
to
go
to
shore,
he
would
have
to
go
by
way
of
the
winosook,
by
way
the
catwalk,
alleged
that
was
man
around
the
side
of
the
winisook
and
thereby
get
on
to
the
dock
by
way
of
a
–
of
a
plank
runway.
when
the
pfeifer
number
two
arrived,
this
--
this
raft
had
been
undergoing
moon
decking
--
was
being
placed
on
it
and
a
that
the
time
of
his
accident
about
three
quarters
of
a
decking
had
been
installed.
so
when
it
arrived,
the
petitioner
began
to
work
aboard
the
pfeifer
number
two,
disassembling
the
pump
and
he
worked
from
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
till
four
in
the
afternoon
and
when
he
got
through,
we
–
the
board
the
vessel,
he
slept
aboard
the
vessel
and
in
the
next
morning
he
resumed
work
again.
it
was
the
intention
that
he
work
until
four
o'
clock
in
the
afternoon
at
that
day
or
sooner
if
the
vessel
left
sooner
and
as
the
matter
of
fact,
it
was
anticipated
that
the
pfeifer
number
two
wouldn't
leave
on
that
date.
he
had
been
working
about
an
hour,
when
a
man
by
the
name
edward
smith,
who
is
the
overall
repair
boss
for
the
respondent,
came
aboard
the
ship
and
he
said
that
--
that
the
two
men
were
too
many
to
do
the
work
of
disassembling
the
pump
and
he
told
the
petitioner,
he
gave
him
the
following
order
which
your
honors
will
find
at
page
23
of
the
record.
he
says
that,
"i
would
like
you
to
finish
putting
this
top
deck
of
plank
for
this
raft
over
there,
so
that
we
can
use
it,
get
it
done."
at
the
trial
incidentally,
there
was
a
claim
that
the
petitioner
had
been
discharged
and
then
immediately
rehired
as
a
compensate
to
give
him
a
chance
to
make
a
day's
pay
for
working
on
this
raft,
as
described,
but
that
was
categorically
denied
and
my
friend
here
has
abandoned
any
implications
that
flow
from
that
claimed
discharge
which
in
any
event
was
for
the
jury
to
decide.
braen,
the
petitioner
having
received
his
orders
from
his
superior
proceeded
to
obey
him.
he
got
his
tools
together,
he
got
his
materials
together,
went
over
to
the
side
of
winisook
which
was
nearer
to
the
raft,
put
his
tools
and
materials
down,
and
started
to
release
the
lines,
so
he
could
pull
up
the
raft
a
little
closer,
in
order
to
get
to
work
on
it
–
ultimately
to
get
work
on
it.
and
while
his
pulling
on
his
line,
the
catwalk
or
ladder
on
which
he
necessary
have
to
stand
and
which
was
part
of
the
winisook,
gave
way
and
he
fell
to
the
raft
and
sustained
the
injuries
for
which
the
jury
had
awarded
him
a
judgment.
now,
these
are
undisputed
facts
which
the
--
the
court
below
has
held
inter
bit
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
jury's
finding
that
the
petition
was
injured
while
the
course
of
his
employment
as
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
the
catwalk
broke
and
he
fell
to
the
raft,
the
catwalk
which
is
part
of
the
winisook.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
no
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
yes
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
yes
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
down
to
the
raft
he
fell.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
it's
about
the
(inaudible)
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
this
is
looking
from
the
dock
towards
the
winisook.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
well,
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
62,
the
photographs
on
page
62
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
that's
right.
58
i
mean.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
you'll
the
raft
there,
and
you
see
the
winisook,
and
you
see
the
plank
ledge
there
and
he
was
at
the
plank
ledge
near
that
open
space.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
well,
i
don't
quite
know
because
this
is
--
this
diagram
was
made
by
the
witness
in
order
to
show
the
relationship
of
the
dock,
the
raft,
the
winisook
and
the
pfeifer.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
he
was
on
the
repair
barge.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
on
the
repair
barge
which
of
course
is
higher
than
the
floating
of
the
raft
which
is
on
the
water
itself
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
--
and
the
ledge
or
the
catwalk
of
the
repair
barge
is
what
gave
way
so
he
precipitated
to
the
raft
below.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
now,
they
hadn't
started
working
on
the
raft
properly,
he
was
getting
ready
as
to
do
it,
his
pulling
off
the
raft
a
little
closer
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
--
so
that
he
could
get
down
to
it.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
that's
--
yes
--
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
he
hadn't
started
working
on
the
raft
yet,
your
honor.
he
was
getting
ready.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
well
he
got
there
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
ultimately
but
not
by
the
reason
that
he
wanted
to.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
not,
not
for
the
reasons
that
he
wanted
to.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
now
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
most
of
the
respondent
can
claim
on
this
issue
is
that
there
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
as
to
whether
the
injury
occurred
in
a
course
of
the
petitioner's
employment
as
a
seaman
and
member
of
a
crew.
and
the
petitioner's
further
position
that
any
finding
that
the
petitioner
was
not
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
as
a
member
of
the
--
as
a
seaman
or
member
of
a
crew,
will
be
contrary
to
law
or
contrary
to
the
evidence
and
(inaudible).
first,
as
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
there
is
a
question
of
fact.
in
senko
against
lacrosse
in
352
united
states,
your
honors
laid
the
test
down
that
the
duties
of
a
man
during
the
vessel's
travel
are
relevant
in
determining
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
crew
when
--
when
injured
while
the
vessel
is
in
anchor.
now,
applying
that
test
to
this
case,
we
have
man
who
is
concededly,
who
concededly
starts
off
work
as
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
crew,
whose
duties
included
in
making
minor
repairs,
who
is
injured
when
about
to
perform
minor
repairs
as
how
he
was
ordered
by
his
superior
to
do,
and
while
the
injury
occurs
by
reason
of
a
defective
condition
of
the
employer's
vessel
where
he
had
to
be
in
order
to
do
what
he
had
been
directed
to
do
and
it
seems
to
me
that
plain
application
of
this
only
stated
test
in
the
senko
case
just
comes
close
to
the
finding
that
he
was
injured
while
in
the
course
of
his
in
employment
as
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
the
crew.
my
friend
here
says
that
it
is
not
enough
that
all
these
conceded
facts
that
are
not
enough,
that
there
must
be
an
additional
factor
namely
that
the
work
he
was
ordered
to
do,
had
to
have
a
direct
relationship
with
the
pfeifer
number
two.
now,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
such
a
relationship
is
necessary
to
establish
the
petitioner's
right
to
a
jones
act
remedy
here
is
the
following.
the
testimony
was
that
the
raft
was
used
to
paint
and
chip
and
repair
such
of
--
the
--
such
of
the
respondent's
vessel
as
needed
it.
in
addition,
at
page
48,
smith
the
overall
boss
testified
as
follows.
did
you
have
any
use
for
that
raft
in
connection
with
doing
any
work
on
the
pfeifer
number
two?
answer,
"not
at
that
time."
question,
did
you
contemplate
using
that
raft
in
connection
with
any
work
on
the
pfeifer
number
two?
now,
i
submit
that
that
answer,
“not
at
that
time,”
clearly
the
establishes
that
somewhere
is
in
time
whether
today,
tomorrow
or
in
some
other
near
future
the
raft
was
going
to
be
used
in
connection
with
the
pfeifer
number
two.
now
there
is
certainly
no
requirement
for
the
applicability
of
the
jones
act
that
the
work
as
a
seaman
being
–
then
and
there
connected
with
the
navigation
or
the
functioning
of
the
vessel.
i've
cited
with
the
hunt
case
and
the
--
the
butler
against
whiteman
cases
where
the
work
was
being
done
on
the
ships
that
were
in
the
dry
dock.
they
wouldn't
be
used
for
three
or
four
weeks
and
took
(inaudible)
and
as
the
matter
of
fact
in
the
butler
case
the
boat
was
being
reconditioned
as
preliminary
to
an
inspection
which
was
a
preliminary
to
putting
it
into
navigation
and
your
honors
held
that
the
jones
act
remedy
was
applicable.
so,
i
submit
that
by
any
test
submission
to
the
jury
of
the
issue
of
plaintiffs
--
of
the
petitioner's
status
at
the
time
of
the
injury
was
the
least
that
he
was
entitled
to.
now,
apart
from
that,
i
say
that
since
it
is
undisputed
that
the
petitioner
was
a
seaman
at
the
time
of
the
act
when
he's
ordered
to
do
work,
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew
at
the
time,
that
he
was
injured
while
doing
what
he'd
been
ordered
to
do
and
that
he
was
injured
on
a
vessel
that
was
owned
and
maintained
by
the
defendant
and
where
he
had
to
be
in
order
to
do
what
he'd
been
ordered
to
do,
that
the
nature
of
the
work
he
was
about
to
perform
whether
it
service
the
vessel
or
was
connected
with
the
vessel
is
immaterial,
is
irrelevant
and
the
reason
i
say
is
this.
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
duties
of
a
man
and
the
--
the
services
he
performed
and
the
relationship
to
the
vessel
have
import
when
one
who
was
not
in
the
first
instance
a
seaman,
tries
to
assume
the
cloak
of
one,
the
mettle
of
one
in
order
to
gain
the
--
benefits
of
the
jones
act
and
then
all
these
matters
are
considered
and
the
answers
to
those
questions
determined
whether
he
was
a
seaman
at
the
time
he
was
injured.
but
that's
not
this
case.
here,
the
petitioner
was
at
all
times
a
seaman
and
was
at
all
times
a
member
of
the
crew
and
then
the
only
issue
was
insofar
as
the
jones
act
is
concerned
is
whether
he
was
injured
and
the
course
of
his
employment,
and
there
is
nothing
else.
and
i
think
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
jones
act
might
said
very
--
very
clear
because
all
that
is
says
--
and
your
final
language
on
page
3
of
my
brief,
all
that
it
says,
"any
seaman
who
shall
suffer
personal
injury
in
the
course
of
his
employment
may
at
his
election
maintain
an
action
for
damages."
nothing
in
there
that
it
had
to
suffer
injury
while
servicing
a
vessel
or
while
aiding
in
his
navigation
or
performing
some
duties
in
connection
with
its
function
as
a
vessel.
the
only
test
is
was
the
injury
sustained
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
in
such
a
case,
the
law
is
clear,
and
i
cited
any
number
of
cases
in
that
point,
but
a
seaman
does
not
lose
his
jones
act
remedy
because
he's
been
ordered
to
do
something
which
ordinarily
a
seaman
doesn't
do,
so
long
he
is
a
seaman
that
performing
orders
and
he's
injured
in
the
performance
of
those
orders
by
a
defective
or
dangerous
condition
of
a
place
maintained
by
his
employer,
he
is
entitled
to
his
jones
act
remedy
irrespective
of
the
"nature"
of
the
services
that
he's
performing.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
it
will
depend
on
where
he
was
hurt,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
well,
if
ashore
and
as
the
defendant
and
his
employer
negligence
not
contribute
to
in
any
way,
then
obviously
he
would
not
have
a
jones
act
remedy.
it
might
have
--
get
you
a
maintenance
or
something
else
but
he
wouldn't
have
the
jones
act
remedy
because
it
is
not
a
place
maintained
or
operated
by
his
employer.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
i
have
cited
a
case
precisely
just
like
that,
that's
the
(inaudible)
is
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
(inaudible),
that's
on
page
i
think
14
of
my
brief
where
a
seaman
was
told
that
there
was
no
more
work
for
him
to
do
and
he
that
he
could
go
home
and
while
he's
going
home,
he
is
injured
by
reason
of
a
defective
condition
of
the
vessel
and
it
was
held
as
entitled
to
a
jones
act
remedy.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
(inaudible)
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
i
think
its
page
14,
on
the
--
16
your
honor,
i'm
sorry
page
16.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
i
would
say
he's
entitled
for
the
jones
act
remedy
because
he
would
come
precisely
within
the
fifth
provision.
he's
was
injured
in
the
course
of
employment
as
a
seaman,
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
jones
act
that
i
find,
certainly
nothing
in
a
language
which
limits
its
application
only
to
certain
of
types
of
situation,
the
certain
kinds
of
work
or
that
--
work
that
aids
and
navigation
the
vessel
or
any
other
condition.
all
it
says
in
the
injured
while
in
the
course
of
employment.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
irrelevant
your
honor.
it's
irrelevant
sometimes
because
there
may
not
be
any
negligence
on
part
of
the
employer.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
that's
right.
then
--
then
it's
relevant
i
say.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
never
reach
the
raft
to
do
the
work
it
was
--
in
other
words
if
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
that's
right
or
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
(voice
overlap)
--
scene
if
smith
had
call
him,
wait
a
minute
will
you
just
put
on
the
vault
under
his
pump
and
he
turn
around
then
he
has
a
course
of
action.
and
it
certainly
sounds
inconceivable
that
he
makes
a
right
turn,
he
has
a
course
of
action,
he
makes
the
left
turn
it
doesn't
have
a
course
of
action
when
everything
else
is
exactly
the
same.
now,
it
deserves
that
there
is
something
in
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
which
limits
the
jones
act
in
someway
or
another
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
that's
a
very
least
–
the
very
least
entitlement
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
because
since
he
didn't
reach
the
raft
i
don't
really
have
to
argue
what
would
happen
if
he
were
on
the
raft?
mr.
benjamin
h.
seiff
but
for
the
very
least
he
is
entitled
to
what
your
honor
just
suggested.
now,
it
is
claimed
that
there's
somehow
or
other
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
modifies
or
limits
the
application
of
the
jones
act.
now,
if
your
honors
read
section
903,
very
short,
it's
on
page
3
of
my
brief
which
contains
the
--
which
contains
the
exclusionary
provisions
of
the
jones
act,
of
the
harbor
workers'
act.
all
that
says
is,
"no
compensation
shall
be
payable
in
respect
to
disability
or
death
of
a
master
or
member
of
a
crew
of
any
vessel."
it's
very
simple
and
then
an
ambiguous
language
and
in
it
i
find
nothing
that
says
only,
"such
members
of
a
crew
are
excluded
from
its
coverage
as
a
servicing
a
vessel
or
further
navigation."
i
find
no
conditions
to
the
exception
from
the
coverage.
all
it
says,
"members
of
a
crew
are
accepted.”
here
we
have
a
member
of
the
crew
and
i
said
that
--
i
said
it
necessarily
he's
accepted
from
the
application
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
and
the
only
question
is
what
remedy
is
he
entitled
to
and
that
of
course
depends
of
what
happens
whether
it's
an
unseaworth
--
in
this
case
or
a
jones
act
case
or
a
maintenance
and
cure
case.
now,
it's
been
suggested
before
but
demonstrating,
i
wanted
to
mention
it
once
again
that
demonstrating
the
fact
that
the
injured
is
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
the
crew,
then
the
only
question
for
the
relating
for
the
appellate
ability
of
the
jones
act
is
where
the
injury
was
in
course
of
employment,
and
that
the
nature
of
his
service
is
wholly
irrelevant,
other
cases,
the
(inaudible)
case
that
i
mentioned
and
the
marceau
case
on
page
15
of
my
brief,
where
a
man
was
coming
back
from
shore
after
a
night
of
pleasure
and
he's
injured
on
the
dock
as
he
approached
the
boat
and
they
held
that
he
was
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
as
a
seaman
and
is
entitled
to
a
jones
act
remedy.
in
other
words,
in
this
case
if
petitioner
instead
of
do
--
instead
of
doing
the
work
that
been
ordered
by
his
superior
to
do,
were
going
off
on
shore
or
to
--
for
other
purposes
he
had
in
mind,
he'd
have
a
jones
act
remedy.
but
when
he
--
doing
the
work
that
he's
ordered
to
do,
he
hasn't
got
the
jones
act
remedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
an
inconceivable
situation.
so,
i
submit
that
the
--
the
language
in
the
senko
case
epitomizes
the
whole
thing
in
just
one
sentence,
it
epitomizes
my
entire
position,
and
as
i've
quoted
from
it
at
page
18
in
my
brief,
it
says,
"coverage
of
the
jones
act
depends
only
on
the
finding
if
the
injured
was
an
employee
of
the
vessel
engaged
in
a
course
of
his
employment
at
the
time
of
his
injury."
now,
that's
this
case.
he
was
a
seaman,
a
member
of
the
crew,
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
while
doing
he'd
been
ordered
to
do
and
since
all
of
the
facts
are
undisputed
and
the
jury
has
found
that
there
was
negligence
in
the
maintenance
of
the
vessel
which
caused
the
injury,
i
submit
that
his
entitled
to
reinstatement
of
this
judgment
which
brings
me
just
for
a
few
moments
with
my
second
point
is
what
remedy
is
he
entitled
to.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
lower
court
has
said
that
if
they
were
an
error,
there
was
an
error
in
holding
if
there
was
no
question
of
fact,
they
would
reverse
in
any
event
in
order
a
new
trial
because
of
the
district
court's
refusal
to
charge
certain
requests
of
the
respondent
all
of
which
dealt
with
the
status
of
the
petitioner
at
the
time
his
injury
and
it's
my
position
that
he's
entitled
to
reinstatement
of
the
judgment
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
the
denial
of
request
did
not
constitute
error
and
second
if
they
did
constitute
error,
it
was
harmless
error.
now,
your
honor
will
find
--
your
honors
will
find
the
request
at
page
75
of
the
record
and
if
they
are
recited
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
the
first
request
was
the
mere
fact
that
the
plaintiff
had
been
a
seaman
and
member
of
the
crew
of
the
barge
pfeifer
number
two
prior
to
his
injury
does
not
entitle
him
to
maintain
this
action
against
his
employer.
now,
i
submit
that
this
request
clarifies
no
issue.
it
defines
nothing.
at
best
it
is
caution
of
some
kind
which
the
record
discloses,
no
need
for
such
a
caution.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
every
time,
every
fear
that
a
lawyer
has
during
a
trial
it
would
be
laid
by
our
specific
request,
you'd
never
had
an
end
to
a
charge.
and
then
it
has
confusing
language
this
action
--
it
does
not
entitle
him
to
maintain
this
action
against
the
employer.
i
don't
know
what
it
would
mean
to
a
jury
it
sound
as
if,
involve
to
right
to
sue
and
i
certainly
think
that
the
refusal
of
that
request
constitutes
no
error
--
no
error.
now,
request
number
two
was,
it
is
the
nature
in
character
of
the
work
being
performed
by
the
plaintiff
at
the
time
of
his
injury,
was
a
--
at
the
time
of
his
injury
was
sustained
which
determines
whether
he
has
the
right
to
maintain
this
lawsuit.
this
is
a
very
general,
a
very
abstract
preposition
of
law
taken
from
a
text
book.
certainly
has
no
relation
to
the
fact,
insofar
as
the
jury
is
concern
that
they
have
to
decide
and
i
think
as
the
general
abstract
composition
of
law,
it
was
not
incumbent
upon
the
trial
court,
the
district
court
to
charge
it,
there
is
no
error
to
refuse
it.
