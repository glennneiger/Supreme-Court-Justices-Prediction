justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
seiff
may
i
ask
you
in
that
connection,
if
he
had
been
ordered
by
the
seaman
aboard
the
ship
to
go
ashore
to
perform
work
and
had
done
so
and
was
injured,
would
he
then
under
the
cases
that
you
cite
still
be
entitled
to
the
remedy
of
the
jones
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
ashore.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
may
i
ask
for,
do
these
cases
that
you
have
cited
had
--
hold
that
one
who
is
a
seaman,
a
member
of
the
crew
maintains
that
status
even
if
discharged
until
he
has
left
to
premises
and
gone
ashore?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
is?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
seiff
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
it
is
my
understanding
what
(inaudible).
now
if
this
individual
had
gotten
to
the
raft
and
we
assume
that
it
was
not
seaman's
work
and
had
commenced
the
work
there,
it
not
being
a
seaman's
work,
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
jones
act
relief
but
that
on,
while
going
to
that
place
and
until
he
got
to
that
place
he
was
still
in
the
same
character
as
when
he
left
the
ship
on
which
he
had
been
a
seaman.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
it
would
not
be
a
defense
under
your
theory
of
the
wong
case,
would
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
right.
now,
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment
why
they
say
that
it
was
harmless
error.
the
third
request
is
that
you
find
that
the
work
which
plaintiff
was
performing
at
the
time
he
sustained
his
injury
was
not
in
connection
with
the
furtherance
of
the
navigation
of
the
pfeifer
number
two,
the
verdict
received
for
the
defendant.
now,
i
--
the
term
“navigation”,
i
submit
is
a
word
of
art.
what
a
jury
--
what
a
jury's
notion
might
be
when
they're
told
that
use,
told
about
navigation
--
to
me
i
mean
--
it
would
seems
to
me,
would
be
--
would
be
limited
ton
something
like
the
--
the
science
of
laying
out
of
course
and
keeping
to.
that
would
be
the
lame
notion
of
navigation.
and
the
law,
of
course
also
as
activities
can
be
in
furtherance
of
navigation
being
a
bartender,
beautician,
or
repair
that
the
--
the
catalog
of
things
that
can
be
done
in
--
in
order
to
further
navigation
without
end.
so,
i
say
that
unexplained
the
term,
the
use
of
the
word
“navigation”
to
a
jury
will
tend
to
mislead
and
confuse
rather
to
clarify
and
guide.
and
the
fourth
request
was
that
the
evidence
show
--
that
at
the
time
plaintiff
sustained
his
injury,
he
was
in
furtherance
of
the
work
completing
the
laying
of
the
deck
on
the
raft.
but
first
of
all,
as
your
honors
know
that
is
not
quite
accurate
since
he
had
never
gotten
to
that
point,
yet
he
was
only
making
ready
for
it
and
then
unless
you
find
that
this
work
was
being
done
by
the
plaintiff
as
a
member
of
the
crew
of
the
pfeifer
number
two,
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
the
repair
of
the
pfeifer
number
two
in
order
to
enable
it
to
continue
in
navigation,
the
verdict
must
be
for
the
defendant.
and
i
submit
that
this
request
has
the
same
deficiencies
with
request
number
three
has
in
it.
and
second
of
all,
it
implied
unless
the
word
then
and
there,
then
it
forget
the
vessel
as
of
the
verdict
for
the
defendant
and
i've
indicated
that
is
not
the
correct
law.
so,
i
submit
that
the
refusal
to
charge
as
requested
did
not
constitute
error,
but
assuming
that
they
were
error
then
i
say
on
the
fact
of
this
case
on
this
record,
it
was
harmless
error,
since
it
is
undisputed
that
the
petitioner
was
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
the
crew,
injured
in
a
course
of
doing
what
he'd
been
ordered
to
do
on
a
vessel,
on
a
place
where
he
had
to
be
in
order
to
perform
the
work
then
any
finding
that
he
was
not
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
as
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
the
crew
would
be
against
the
evidence
could
be
country
to
law,
could
be
insupportable.
and
hence
to
the
errors
that
then
he
was
harmless
and
he's
entitled
to
reinstatement
of
the
judgment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
does
not
explain
catwalk
for
ledge
as
we
see
on
page
--
on
the
exhibit
of
two
at
page
56.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
picture
of
page
(voice
overlap)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
seems
then
to
indicate
a
ledge
run
in
the
full
length
of
the
winisook?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
what
you
call
the
catwalk?
