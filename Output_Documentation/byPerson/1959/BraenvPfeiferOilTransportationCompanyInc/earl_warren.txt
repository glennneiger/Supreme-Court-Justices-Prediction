right
under

assigned

other
than
those
of
a

him
to
do
something
other
than
as
a

member?
chief

by
that,
do
you
mean

couple
of
days?
chief

i
beg
you
pardon?
chief

too
many
men
working
on
this
one
job,
he
said
to

to
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
now
there
are
too
many
of
you
working
on
this
job,
i
want
you
to
do
something
else.
and
he
assigned
him
something
to
do
on
the
pfeifer
but
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
something
that
a
crew
would
ordinarily
do,
what
the
man
is
a
good
employee
went
and
did
it
and
was
injured
through
the
negligence
of
the
pfeifer.
would
the
jones
act
apply,
would
he
be
a
member
the
crew
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
--
now
let's
say
--
let's
say

he
was
--
he
was
preparing
some
planks
for
this
very
--
this
very
decking
that
he
was
to
supply
for
the
other
ship
and
was
he
went
to
a
deck
below
on
the
--
on
the
pfeifer
to
cut
some
planks
or
something
that
kind
for
