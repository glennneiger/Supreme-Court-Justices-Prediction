justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
isn't
relevant
to
this
case
but
for
completeness
sake?
may
--
does
the
retirement
of
granting
a
rehearing
or
hearing
en
banc
required
to
be
done
by
all
active
circuit
judges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
(voice
overlap)
decide
that,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
never
been
anybody
thought
about
this
problem,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it
didn't
say
any
more
--
the
opinions
don't
indicated
that,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
whether
what
the
position
of
the
government
is
on
the
question
of
determining
whether
there
should
be
an
en
banc
hearing
or
rehearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
can
you
search
whether
you
did
or
did
not
have
an
active
share?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
granted
--
what
i
want
to
know
that
evidence
didn't
make
myself
clear.
may
a
panel
of
three
call
upon
the
grant
of
motion
for
rehearing
en
banc
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
include
a
nonactive,
a
retired
judge
in
this
convention
sense
of
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
--
if
i
may
include
this,
but
if
they're
nonactive
members,
one
of
the
three
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
knows
what
inference
he
had
in
getting
two
active,
one
is
to
grant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
majority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
there
are
only
--
suppose
there
are
only
four
active
circuit
judges
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
two
of
them
sit
on
the
panel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
couldn't
grant,
could
they,
a
rehearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
two
of
four.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
top
of
that,
it
would
have
been
granted
if
this
--
that
a
persuasive
and
powerful
nonactive
judge
hasn't
been
one
of
the
three
denying
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
talking
may
affect
voting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
you
got
to
give
congruity
to
the
statute,
those
irrelevant
considerations.
and
you
don't
read
this
--
you
don't
need
a
jurisdictional
statute
mechanically
that
way
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
court
held
that
three
equals
five.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yeah
it
could
be
on
your
--
on
the
basis
of
your
argument
that
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
read
in
active
service
equal
active
circuit
judges,
i
don't
see
how
they
--
how
you
can
by
consent
upon
order
on
the
rule
of
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
grant
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
to
the
justice
as
well.
preliminary
to
that
would
you
tell
me
whether
43
(b)
and
46
(c)
were
contemporaneously
drafted
and
adopted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
originally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
this
to
you,
we
are
going
to
cut
if
fine
--
let
me
try
cutting
this
fine.
46
(c)
says
that
in
any
event
the
court
en
banc
can
consist
of
all
active
circuit
judges
in
any
event,
five
or
seven
or
whatever
they
are,
but
since
the
decision
en
banc
is
as
important
as
that
that
had
all
of
those
who
are
qualified
to
sit
to
the
court
of
appeals
join
in
this
determinative
decision.
so
that
the
court
en
banc
shall
consist
of
all
active
circuit
judges
at
a
minimum
as
a
prerequisite
for
convening
the
court
en
banc,
but
addition
thereto,
the
circuit
justice
may
join
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
who
are
qualified
to
sit
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
should
be
so
impressive
a
tribunal
that
all
those
who
can
exercise
the
court
of
appeal
function
should
be
included
in
the
court
and
in
the
en
banc
composition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
that
is
--
that
is
you
cut
fine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
in
answer
to
your
suggestion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
suggestion
that
otherwise
a
court
en
banc
should
consist
of
all
active
circuit
judges
means
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
means
an
indispensible
prerequisite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
addition
--
in
addition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
en
banc,
judge
hand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
correct
me,
but
i
believe
judge
clark
with
tears
in
his
eyes,
weeping
heavily
he
said,
he
was
very
sorry
that
he
should
try
to
disqualify
judge
hand
because
he
himself
had
summoned
into
sit
in
the
case.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
know
but
--
but
we
always
read
the
statute
as
it's
written
with
such
light
in
addition
that
we
can
cast
upon
it
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
saying
i
am
going
to
read
it
that
way
but
you
got
to
do
better
than
just
to
make
fun
of
it
and
i'll
put
these
practical
considerations
to
you.
judge
learned
hand
and
judge
swan
are
for
all
practical
purposes
active
judges.
he's
not
in
the
technical
sense.
they
are
acting
judges
in
that
circuit.
i
do
not
think
it
would
destroy,
i
can
hardly
conceive
that
it
would
destroy
the
working
of
en
banc
if
those
wise
and
experienced
men
were
also
added
with
the
present
younger
and
much
more
vigorous
minded,
but
i
am
not
sure
wiser
men
were
now
active
as
circuit
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
then
be
on
policy
grounds
because
of
the
judicial
counsel
just
relied
on
the
proposed
legislative
recommendation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
(inaudible)
advocate.
i
think
that
limited
authorization
makes
it
even
worst
that
a
fellow
who
was
parted
through
a
panel
decision
and
then
sits
in
an
en
banc
and
perpetually
an
ad
hoc
decision.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
even
less
desirable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
this
case
doesn't
open
up
--
doesn't
open
the
door
wide,
this
case
represents
the
various
special
situation,
namely,
a
judge
--
this
all
can
be
obviated
and
you
suggested
in
your
brief
as
i
quickly
faced
it,
namely,
he
holds
--
withholds
his
retirement
until
he's
through
with
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
not
world-checking
problem,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
no
hearings
en
banc
in
the
second
circuit
up
until
judge
learned
hand
retired
as
the
--
as
the
chief
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
excuse
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
order
granting
en
banc
hearing
which
was
exposed
around
fields,
around
briefs
here
that
was
a
wholly
valid
order,
was
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
should
that
be
vacated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
you
vacate
what
the
court
--
vacate
the
judgement
in
this
case
and
leading
the
court
of
appeals
to
--
to
anything
it
please
not
inconsistent
with
that.
that
would
allow
to
vacate
the
order
en
banc.
i
don't
quite
see
why
that
could
be
done
because
when
that
was
entered,
that
was
a
valid
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
would
leave
specifically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
nothing
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
simply
want
to
be
satisfied
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
should
stay
and
--
and
i
think,
it
would
be
--
there
would
be
nothing
to
rule
why
the
court
of
appeals
properly
constituted
according
to
your
view
should
vacate
that,
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
but
since
that
was
not
challenged
and
the
challenge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
here
is
that
the
judgment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
following
a
valid
order.
i
don't
see
why
denounce
the
whole
world
if
--
if
we
can't
hear
en
banc,
we'll
let
the
panel
judgement
stand.
i
don't
see
why
they
should
have
any
discretion
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
is
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
refutal.
there
is
a
refutal
on
the
statute,
isn't
it?
you
yourself
said
a
little
while
ago,
nobody
thought
about
this
problem
in
48
and
there's
the
lacuna
which
we
say,
it
shall
consist
of
the
active
judges
and
thereby
tried
in
denying
that
although
it
began
to
consist
of,
it
was
--
it
was
of
necessity
terminated
the
day
before
that
the
opinion
came
on,
he
was
retired
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
say
it,
that's
my
word
and
that's
my
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
incontestable
--
logical,
purely
logical
argument,
but
there's
a
different
in
fact
between
the
board
--
the
court
being
properly
constituted
when
it
engages
to
hear
and
begins
the
process
of
determination,
and
a
court
which
begins
the
process
of
determination
when
the
man
is
disqualified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
de
facto
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
problem
of
de
facto
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
elman
makes
the
point
that
it's
one
thing
for
a
nonactive
member
of
the
particular
circuit
to
sit
when
they
deny
an
application
for
sitting
en
banc
and
when
they
grant
it
can
actually
sit
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
let's
see
if
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
chief
justice's
questions
was
whether
the
principle
that
--
what
you
said
was
the
prevailing
body
of
judicial
authority
that
when
a
man
is
a
new
member
of
--
has
jurisdiction
to
sit
in
a
case
which
is
terminable
on
some
condition
to
be
fulfilling
a
vacancy
and
so
on.
he
may
continue
to
sit
after
the
condition
of
his
temporary
appointment
has
come
to
an
end,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
chief
justice,
as
i
understood
him,
then
asked,
does
that
apply
to
the
--
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
so
that
a
member
of
this
court
having
heard
the
argument,
participated
at
conference
and
as
has
been
the
case
even
drafted
an
opinion
in
which
the
court
joined.
if
thereafter,
if
he
retires
before
there's
an
actual
announcement
of
the
decision
of
a
monday,
he
can
no
longer
participate
in
it.
i
think
there
is
certainly
one
or
two
cases
in
which
this
court
has
said
this
is
substantially
the
opinion
which
was
written
by
brother
jones
and
the
court
now
adopts
it.
but
he
himself
ceases
to
be
--
he
is
faultless
if
he's
not
actually
physically
in
service
as
a
member
of
the
court
on
the
given
monday
when
the
case
is
ever
done.
i
thought
you
said
you
thought
there
was
a
specific
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
the
statute.
i
should
be
greatly
surprised
of
that
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
as
a
circuit
justice,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you
can
say
is
that
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
once
a
judge
resigns
or
retires
--
that
he
retires,
he
can
no
--
he
is
no
longer
an
active
--
i'm
not
questioning
--
he's
no
longer
potentially
capable
of
functioning
on
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
case
of
retiring
--
retiring
or
retired
circuit
judges,
putting
this
thing
aside,
they
do
continue
to
exercise
--
they
may
exercise
all
the
functions
they
did
regarding
this
problem
here,
the
day
before
they
retire.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he's
still
a
member
of
the
collegium
or
collectivity
that
constitutes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
court
whereas
that
is
not
the
one
we
tried.
well,
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wouldn't
really
--
he
isn't
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
is
that
this
--
that
judge
medina
was
a
member
of
a
court
en
bank
which
consisted
of
all
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
that
is
not
cut
down
by
the
first
sentence,
shall
be
heard
and
determined
who
are
in
active
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
short
of
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
read
--
you
don't
qualify
the
last
sentence
by
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
--
the
function
of
court
is
to
determine,
you
read
quite
--
quite
--
you
read
literally
but
for
the
court
en
bank
should
consist
of
all
active
circuit
judges
in
the
circuit
that
it
so
consist
--
your
reading.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
wasn't
an
active
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
technical
sense,
he
was
not
an
active
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
participated
in
the
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
an
active
judge
when
the
court
was
constituted
and
you
rest
on
that,
on
the
literal
translation
of
that
last
--
meaning
of
the
last
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
judge
magruder
sat
in
other
circuits,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
magruder
sat
outside
of
the
first
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
know,
but
my
point
is,
did
judge
magruder
sit
in
other
circuits
beginning
the
case
when
he
was
still
in
active
service
and
concluding
when
he
had
retired.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
first
circuit
and
he
sat
in
cases
in
which
he
sat
as
a
--
unquestionably
an
active
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
decision
wasn't
determined
until
after
he
had
retired.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
rather
broad
statement,
mr.
fort.
that
means
that
whatever
we
think
is
desirable
to
the
new
administration
of
justice,
allows
us
to
determine
the
scope
and
authority
of
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
be
highly
desirable
for
that
to
--
it
will
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
you
could
create
an
ambiguity
that
reaches
a
very
undesirable
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
call
it
formal
because
all
of
this
is
formal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
call
it
formal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
assumes
that
designation
is
formal
and
congress
may
have
made
--
may
have
made
the
requirement
as
a
piece
of
paper,
the
essential
things.
i
don't
see
that
the
argument
is
advanced
by
calling
that
formal
and
this
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
if
the
requirement
of
the
statute
is
fulfilled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
answered
justice
black
earlier
that
you
don't
have
to
bother
by
policy
considerations
if
the
statute
commands.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says
it
should
be
designated.
i
don't
have
to
go
beyond
if
congress
wants
to
make
a
red
tape
or
a
blue
ribbon
of
requirement,
i
must
vow
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
say
that
definition
is
satisfied
because
the
--
and
presumably,
he
did
that
to
him,
that's
a
different
story
again.
but
i
don't
like
to
have
cases
of
this
technicality
disposed
of.
and
by
technicality,
i
don't
need
to
use
an
invidious
adjective.
i
simply
say
confining
word.
that's
what
i
mean
by
a
technicality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
you
also
mentioned
that
in
your
briefs
and
has
--
has
offered
a
great
line
to
be
drawn
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
i
have
to
shut
off
while
considering
the
whole
nature
of
these
problems
or
what
to
do
with
this
conventional
fact
that
retired
judges
are
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
as
a
matter
of
design,
fulfilling
