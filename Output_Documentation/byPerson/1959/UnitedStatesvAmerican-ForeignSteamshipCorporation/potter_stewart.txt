stewart
but
mr.
before
you
leave
that,
how
can
--
how
can
a
litigant
ever
know
or
how
can
a
reader
of
the
court's
opinion
ever
know
whether
or
not
the
retired
judge
was
designated
and
assigned.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
when
this
is
all
within
the
circuit
when
it's
--
when
it's
a
matter
of
the
chief
circuit
judge
designating
a
retired
circuit
judge
of
that
circuit
to
sit
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
requiring
that
that
be
in
writing,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
like
to
--
i
have
the
--
justice
potter
stewart

that
--
that
involves

it's
in
the
code.

just
before

stewart
and
hertzog
in
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
this
precise
question
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
by
this
precise
question.
i
mean
the
case
of
a
--
of
a
circuit
judge
who
was
concededly
by
any
test
was
an
appropriate
proper
member
of
an
en
banc
court
because
he
was
an
active
circuit
judge
at
the
time
of
the
convening
of
that
court.
justice
potter
stewart
but
who's
subsequently
and
prior
to
the
announcement
of
the
decision,
retired.
that's
the
precise
question.
