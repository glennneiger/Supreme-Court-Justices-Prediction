mr.
arthur
m.
becker
may
it
please
the
court.
before
getting
into
my
main
argument
on
this
point,
i
should
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
raised
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
on
the
first
question,
section
43
(b)
and
section
46
both
went
up
to
give
it
as
one
piece
of
legislation
in
every
draft.
part
of
section
of
43
(b)
had
been
in
section
120
of
the
former
judicial
code,
section
which
is
outlined
in
my
brief.
section
120
of
the
former
judicial
code
provided
that
the
circuit
justice
and
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
shall
be
competent
to
sit
with
the
court
en
banc.
it
also
provided
that
a
district
judge
had
a
limited
competency
that
he
could
sit
with
the
court
of
appeals
only
when
his
presence
was
necessary
to
fill
out
a
three-judge
court.
but
the
new
43
(b)
which
in
the
earlier
draft
is
called
section
42
went
up
together
with
46
and
they
were
discussed
together
at
all
times.
those
two
sections
were
bracketed
throughout
the
entire
legislative
history.
i
have
all
the
drafts
and
in
every
draft
those
two
sections
were
discussed
together.
now,
i
think
this
--
that's
the
first
point
i
should
like
--
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
that
a
little
later,
because
i
think,
the
legislative
history
affirmatively
shows
that
the
revisions
that
were
made
in
section
43
(b)
from
the
former
section
120
of
the
judicial
code
was
specifically
designed
to
make
designated
and
assigned
justices
and
judges
competent
to
sit
on
the
court
en
banc.
so,
they
were
put
in
there
for
that
specific
purpose.
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
or
two.
now,
in
answer
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
use
of
differentiation
i
would
mean.
i
think,
this
court
in
the
western
pacific
railroad
case
held
that
section
46
was
a
grant
of
power,
the
entire
section,
to
a
court
of
appeals
to
assign
judges
has
to
distribute
its
work
among
its
members.
the
court
of
appeals
is
defined
in
section
43
(b),
in
the
first
section,
as
the
active
circuit
judges
of
a
circuit.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
i
think
that
section
46
said,
“those
judges,
the
active
judges
of
a
circuit
can
assign
and
distribute
the
work
among
any
judges
competent
to
sit
as
members
of
the
court.”
however
with
respect
to
46
(c),
the
section
said,
“all
active
judges
must
be
members
of
the
court
en
banc,”
but
it
did
not
preclude
the
active
judges
of
the
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
from
assigning
other
judges
to
that
court
as
well.
now,
i
think
judge
medina's
situation
is
different
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
en
banc
court
and
i
do
not
think,
he
could
have
been
excluded
after
being
a
member
of
the
en
banc
court.
but
as
i
interpret
the
statute,
i
would
see
nothing
wrong
in
a
court
of
appeals
to
break
a
tie
or
because
they
anticipate
a
tie
or
because
they
felt
it
would
be
advisable
from
--
from
assigning
judge
hand
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think
they
have
to
because
the
grant
of
power
is
the
active
judges.
they
must
assign
all
active
judges
of
the
circuit
to
that
court,
but
i
think
they
have
the
power
under
section
46
to
assign
any
competent
judge
but
they
don't
have
to
do
that.
that's
where
they
have
discretion.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
your
honor,
i
am
relying
on
the
entire
section
not
on
46
(c).
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
oh,
46
on
the
entire
section
46.
i
say
in
46,
the
entire
section
deals
with
the
constitution
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
its
divisions,
and
the
times
that
shall
sit
and
who
shall
be
assigned
to
it.
that
is
what
the
section
says.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
sir.
but
section
43
(b)
which
states
that
designated
and
assigned
judges
shall
be
competent
and
without
any
qualification
to
sit
as
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
believe
it
gives
the
active
judges
of
the
circuit
who
comprise
the
court
the
power
and
authority
to
--
to
assign
any
judge
who
has
been
assigned
to
the
court
to
a
court
en
banc
in
addition
to
the
active
members
of
the
court
(inaudible).
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
and
that
is
precisely
i'd
like
to
point
out
what
the
fifth
circuit
in
bishop
against
bishop
did.
there
have
been
a
lot
cases
on
this
and
every
one
of
them
is
consistent
with
this
theory.
in
bishop
against
bishop,
judge
magruder
who
was
then
an
active
judge
of
the
first
circuit
sat
--
had
been
designated
and
assigned
to
the
third
circuit.
he
sat
on
the
panel.
after
the
case
was
decided
by
the
panel,
the
court
en
banc,
five
judges
of
the
court
which
were
a
quorum,
as
a
quorum
provision,
and
the
court
consisted
of
seven
so
far
with
quorum.
the
court
en
banc
consisting
of
judge
magruder
and
four
other
judges
sat,
denied
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
and
judge
maris
who
--
i
don't
just
--
i
am
not
singling
him
out,
but
i
am
mentioning
him
because
the
government's
argument
is
continuously
on
speculation
of
what
judge
maris
would
have
done.
but
judge
maris
was
a
member
of
the
court
and
judge
magruder
did
sit
with
the
court
en
banc
in
denying
a
rehearing
en
banc.
and
if
you
recall
on
the
western
pacific
railroad
case,
this
court
said
the
court
could
sit
en
banc
to
consider
the
petitions
for
rehearing
en
banc
or
could
decide
them
informally.
apparently
the
--
the
practice
in
the
third
circuit
is
for
the
court
to
sit
in
en
banc
and
that's
precisely
what
happened.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
certainly.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
your
honor.
i
mentioned
the
case
of
bishop
against
fisher
in
which
judge
maris
participated
as
being
in
the
first
circuit,
i'm
told
--
i
meant
the
third
circuit
which
judge
magruder
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
has
been
assigned
from
the
first
to
the
third
circuit
and
then
participated
in
the
en
banc
--
in
the
en
banc
decision
to
deny
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
third
circuit,
not
in
the
fifth.
now,
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
then
sir,
of
a
judge
assigned
from
another
circuit.
yes,
but
we
have
found
several
cases
precisely
like
this
one
in
three
circuits
--
three
other
circuits
where
a
judge
who
an
active
judge
who
was
assigned
to
a
court
of
appeals
en
banc
and
thereafter
retired
after
the
case
was
submitted,
participated
in
the
decision
of
the
court.
now,
we
found
that
that
practice
to
be
followed
in
the
third
circuit
and
we
have
two
cases
in
our
briefs
on
that
in
addition
to
the
two
cases
we
have,
are
(inaudible)
and
(inaudible)
against
the
auto
racing
association.
now,
they
referred
to
in
the
government's
reply
brief
on
page
4
and
in
our
supplemental
brief
on
page
2.
in
both
of
those
cases,
judge
maris,
the
situation
is
exactly
the
same.
they
were
heard
exactly
the
same
time
by
a
court
en
banc
of
which
judge
maris
is
an
active
judge
of
the
third
circuit
participated.
thereafter,
judge
maris
retired.
thereafter,
he
participated
in
the
decision
of
both
of
those
cases
on
the
same
day.
it's
precisely
the
same
as
the
case
now
before
the
court.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
they
--
no
--
no,
this
was
not
a
grant
of
rehearing.
judge
maris
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
there
had
been
a
grant
of
a
rehearing.
it's
like
this
case.
it's
not
like
this
supposititious
case.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
and
he
was
on
the
court
en
banc
on
the
rehearing
or
on
the
hearing
or
rehearing.
he
was
a
member
of
the
court
en
banc
just
like
judge
medina
was.
thereafter,
he
retired.
thereafter,
the
case
was
decided
and
he
participated
in
the
court's
decision.
we
have
also
found
in
addition
to
that,
two
--
three
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
we
have
called
to
the
court's
attention.
those
three
cases
are
herzog
against
the
united
states.
in
those
cases,
judges
bauman
and
orr
heard
the
case
en
banc,
thereafter,
retired
and
thereafter,
participated
in
the
court's
opinion.
the
other
case
was
united
states
against
price.
in
that
case,
judge
healey
who
was
a
member
of
the
court
en
banc
that
heard
the
case
thereafter
retired
and
thereafter,
participated
in
the
court's
decision.
now,
there
is
another
case,
in
re
sawyer,
in
which
judge
denman
had
participated
in
the
case
but
withdrew,
he
did
withdraw.
judge
hamlin
who
had
been
appointed
between
the
time
it
was
submitted
and
the
time
it
was
heard,
did
not
participate.
and
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
that
case
is
that
this
was
an
individual
determination
of
judge
denman.
now,
the
court
pointedly
said,
the
only
reason
he
didn't
--
didn't
participate
was
that
he
didn't
want
to
in
every
implication
particularly
since
it's
bracketed
between
the
two
other
cases
where
they
did
permit
the
retired
judges
to
participate.
every
implication
is,
the
court
said,
“well,
if
you
don't
want
to,
you
don't
have
to.”
but
the
court
did
not
deny
him
that
right.
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
two
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
the
court
sat
on
a
rehearing,
sat
to
determine
whether
a
rehearing
en
banc
should
be
granted.
now,
in
those
cases
the
point
was
specifically
raised
by
dissenting
judges
like
it
was
here
as
to
whether
judge
sibley,
who
had
sat
with
the
court
en
bank
could
participate
in
the
decision
en
bank
denying
a
petition
for
rehearing.
he
did
vote,
it
was
denied
3-to-2
with
his
vote
and
the
other
two
judges
dissented
and
said,
“he
had
no
right
to
participate
and
thereto,
there
were
two
other
judges
who
had
been
appointed
in
the
meantime,
one
to
take
judge
sibley's
place
and
one
to
take
judge
lee's
place
who
had
died
but
had
not
participated
in
the
original
decision
because
he
was
ill
in
the
original
case.
and
the
court
did
not
permit
these
two
new
judges
to
participate
in
the
question
of
whether
a
rehearing
en
banc
should
be
granted
but
did
permit
judge
sibley
to
participate
and
it
was
denied
3-to-2
with
his
vote
being
decided.
so
we
have
three
other
circuits.
i
think
that
case
is
the
same
in
principle
as
this
case.
we
have
two
circuits
in
which
the
same
question
has
arisen
and
be
decide
this
way,
a
third
circuit
in
which
a
question
identical
in
principle
has
arisen
and
to
decide
it
this
way.
and
then
also
in
the
third
circuit,
you
have
the
case
of
the
judges
--
of
the
active
judge
from
one
circuit
sitting
by
assignment
and
that
leads
to
the
same
result.
so,
every
case,
now,
it's
very
difficult
to
say
we
have
every
case
your
honor
because
they're
not
--
they're
not
normally
classified.
we
found
them
by
leafing
through
the
books
but
i
had
two
people
doing
that
for
six
months
and
done
it
myself.
my
colleagues
had
done
the
same
thing
and
the
government
has
with
every
case
any
of
us
have
found
all
went
that
way
in
every
single
circuit.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
no
sir
but
--
but
we
did
look
--
we
did
--
we
did
try
to.
we
--
we
took
the
list
of
the
retired
judges
and
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
and
we
went
through
it
as
well
as
we
could.
we
may
have
missed
it
because
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--as
you
see
if
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
it's
not
classified
it's
a
rather
difficult
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
situation.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
they're
--
they're
in
the
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
there
--
there
nine.
and
you
mean
in
the
ninth
circuit?
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
the
ninth
circuit
the
three
cases
are,
herzog
against
the
united
states,
in
re
sawyer
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
in
re
sawyer,
s-a-w-y-e-r,
in
re
sawyer
and
they
are
referred
to
on
pages
21
and
22
of
my
main
brief.
and
the
third
case
with
the
ninth
circuit
is
united
states
against
price
and
that
is
referred
to
on
page
4
of
the
government's
reply
brief
and
on
page
2
of
my
supplemental
brief.
those
are
the
three
ninth
circuit
cases.
the
third
circuit
cases
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this
because
i
have
always
disagreed
with
--
with
the
government's
interpretation
of
judge
maris'
views.
they
say
judge
maris
would
have
denied
that,
he
never
said
that.
he
spoke
of
active
judges
participating
generally
but
he
never
--
he
never
spoke
of
this
situation
where
the
judge
was
designated
and
assigned
to
the
court
before
he
retired.
now,
therefore
i
want
to
particularly
stress
the
two
cases
that
arose
in
the
third
circuit
because
there,
(inaudible),
appear
on
page
4
of
the
government's
reply
brief
and
c-o-r-e-b-i,
corebi
against
the
auto
racing
company
which
is
also
on
page
4
the
government's
reply
brief.
and
they
are
on
page
2
of
my
supplemental
brief.
now,
and
though
both
of
those
cases
the
judge
retired
after
participating
in
the
--
after
hearing
the
case
en
banc
was
judge
maris.
and
he
himself
thereafter,
voted
with
the
court
and
participated
in
its
decision
just
like
judge
medina
did
in
this
case.
so
i
do
think
that
our
interpretation
of
his
views
is
correct
rather
than
the
government's
interpretation
of
his
use
of
some
general
statements
he
made.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
the
question
--
the
--
the
only
case
in
which
i
know
of
in
which
the
action
of
the
judge
was
ever
attacked
in
participating
was
in
this
case
and
also
in
the
two
fifth
circuit
cases
where
judge
sibley
participated
in
denying
where
his
vote
was
decisive,
after
he
retired
in
denying
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc.
and
that
was
the
case
where
the
court
sat
en
banc
to
deny
the
petition
for
a
rehearing
en
banc.
and
in
that
case
the
dissenting
judges
in
both
of
those
cases
attacked
his
right
to
sit
on
the
court.
those
are
the
only
cases
that
i
know
of
or
i
think
the
government
has
made
a
similar
statement
in
its
brief
that
they
know
of
in
which
the
--
in
which
the
question
was
actually
discussed.
now
i'd
also
like
to
make
one
other
point.
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
western
pacific
railroad
case,
that
in
western
pacific
railroad
case,
this
court
held
that
the
majority
of
the
active
judges
of
the
circuit
could
delegate
authority
to
a
panel
either
to
deny
or
to
grant
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
and
that
was
specifically
before
them
that
the
panel
in
that
case
consisted
of
two
district
judges
and
one
circuit
judge.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
majority
of
the
opinion
noted
that
fact
and
said
that's
why
this
--
now,
if
i
might
go
into
the
western
pacific
railroad
case
a
little
more
because
i
think
it's
terribly
important
to
this
problem.
what
happened
there
was,
the
majority
of
the
courts
--
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“we
will
not
pass
on
a
petition
for
--
for
a
rehearing
en
banc.”
this
is
a
question
for
the
panel.
the
panel
said
or
--
or
this
court
interpreted
the
panel
as
saying,
“we
think
we're
without
authority
in
law
to
determine
whether
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
should
be
granted.”
judge
vinson
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
said,
“this
panel
consisted
of
one
circuit
court
judge
and
two
district
judges.”
he
said
that
specifically
but
it
was
the
court
of
appeals,
nevertheless.
and
we
--
we
hold
that
the
--
that
the
majority
of
the
active
judges
could
determine
to
abide
by
the
decision
of
this
panel
by
entrusting
the
question
of
whether
a
rehearing
en
banc
should
be
granted
to
them.
and
we
know
that
two
of
the
judges
are
in
this
panel
were
district
judges
and
perhaps
that's
why
they
thought
they
had
no
authority
to
act
so
we're
sending
the
case
back
because
we
think
they
could
have
acted
or
they
said,
“the
court
if
it
liked,
the
active
judges
could
themselves
have
decided
the
petition.”
but
in
any
procedure,
the
majority
of
the
active
judges
decide
this
perfectly
call
of
right.
they
can
either
delegate
their
whole
authority
to
this
panel
with
two
--
two
district
judges
and
one
circuit
judge
or
they
themselves
can
adopt
the
procedure
whereby
they
will
decide
whether
a
rehearing
en
banc
should
be
granted.
and
i
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well.
i
don't
know,
your
honor
but
i'm
--
i'm
rather
inclined
to
think
it
does
because
the
broad
rationale
of
the
--
of
the
western
pacific
railroad
case
was,
that
it's
a
grant
of
power
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
--
devise
any
acceptable
procedure.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
between
the
active
judges
who
the
statute
says
can
determine
whether
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
should
be
granted
and
the
active
judges
who
may
sit
with
the
court.
and
i
think
the
one
follows
with
the
other
and
it's
a
logical
--
there's
also
many
other
reasons
why
i
believe
that's
true
but
there's
a
logical
compactness
with
it.
certainly,
the
judges
who
can
vote,
grant
a
rehearing
or
designate
as
judges
in
active
service
are
precisely
the
same
category
of
judges
who
can
preside
on
it.
now,
i
think
the
western
pacific
railroad
case
said,
as
i
interpret
it,
“the
active
judges
of
a
circuit
are
primarily
members
of
the
court
of
appeals.
they
must
be
consulted.
they
must
be
members
of
a
court
en
banc
and
the
legislative
history
shows
us.
that's
why
it
said
all
active
judges
of
the
circuit
shall
constitute
or
a
court
en
banc
shall
consist
of
all
active
judges
of
the
circuit.
if
they
wish
to
call
someone
else
in
or
they
wish
to
delegate
part
of
their
authority,
they
can
do
so
and
i
think
that
avoids
the
reductio
ad
absurdum
that
mr.
elman
spoke
up.
in
other
words
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
sir.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
well
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
well
that's
what
i
--
that's
what
i
do
think.
now,
your
honor
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
this
precise
problem
because
there's
no
--
in
this
case,
there's
no
disagreement
as
to
a
judge
who
has
been
assigned.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well
i
--
i
don't
wish
to
accept.
i
was
trying
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
but
that
i
--
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
that's
quite
correct
and
i
don't
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
simply
this
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
i
think
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
i
think
section
46
(c)
refers
to
the
times
the
court
is
constituted.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
the
time
that
the
court
en
banc
is
constituted
not
to
a
subsequent
time.
this
is
a
section
--
the
entire
section
46
refers
to
the
--
gives
authority
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
assign
its
work
and
distributed
among
its
member
and
to
constitute
itself
into
divisions
or
into
a
court
en
banc.
now,
if
the
court
is
lawfully
constituted
at
that
time,
a
subsequent
change
in
status
of
one
of
its
members
does
not
render
him
incompetent
to
sit.
now,
your
honor
this
is
not
a
new
question.
this
has
come
up
in
literally
dozens
of
cases
where
a
jurisdictional
statute
in
addition
to
those
i've
cited,
the
precise
cases,
en
banc
cases
i've
cited.
there
were
literally
dozens
of
cases
where
a
jurisdictional
statute
says,
“a
judge
may
sit
with
the
court
while
a
vacancy
exists.”
the
vacancy
is
filled
and
under
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
he
has
no
authority.
in
every
single
one
of
those
cases
and
there
i
do
believe,
we've
read
every
single
one
of
them.
the
courts
have
held
that
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
to
refer
to
the
constitution
of
a
court
at
the
time
it's
convened.
and
they
said
if
a
judge
no
longer
has
authority
that
refers
to
new
cases,
not
to
cases
which
have
been
committed
to
the
consideration
of
a
court
while
he
was
a
member
of
a
court.
that
rule
of
statutory
construction,
the
cases
were
collected
in
--
the
cases
were
collected
in
district
of
columbia
case
of
all
these
various
jurisdictional
statutes
(inaudible)
which
we've
cited
here.
they
quote
the
language
of
the
statute.
it's
always
peremptory
in
form
that
says
he
has
authority
up
to
this
point
and
in
every
case
state
and
federal,
the
courts
have
said,
“this
does
not
stop
a
judge
who
is
lawfully
a
member
of
a
court
for
completing
a
case
which
he
heard
as
a
member
of
the
court."
i'd
like
to
point
(voice

mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
there's
no
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
are
found
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
we
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
your
honor,
we
found
or
--
or
you
mean
this
--
i'm
sorry,
you
mean
the
supreme
court?
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
oh
--
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
not
say
it
applied
to
this
court
because
i
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
that
in
the
retired
judges,
it
says
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
i
think
with
respect
to
retired
justices
in
this
court
if
my
memory
serves
me
right,
the
statute
says
they
shall
not
participate
thereafter,
in
--
in
any
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
after
they
retire.
i
think
there
is
a
special
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
i
--
i
haven't
got
of
the
statute
before
me
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
i
will.
i
think
there
is
a
--
i
think
there
is
a
specific
well
--
more
than
the
assignment
statute.
it
says
they
can
never
thereafter
be
assigned
to
the
supreme--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well.
there
maybe
another
policy
but
i
don't
know
--
i
do
--
my
offhand
reaction
was
that
there
--
there
is
probably
a
policy
for
justices
not
to
participate
after
they
retired
from
the
supreme
court.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
i
think
there's
a
policy
by
recollection
as
indicated
in
the
--
in
these
sections
of
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
but
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
examined
that
question.
i
have
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's,
right.
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well
i
did
but
i
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
i
--
i
think
your
honor,
i
was
referring
to
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
subsequent
assignment
for
designation
of
--
of
a
justice
of
this
court.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
that
--
that
the
statute
says
it
even
designated
the
courts
other
than
the
supreme
court
as
i
believe
assigned
to
them.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
i
think
so.
yes
--
yes
i
think
that's
quite
right
but
--
but
it
seems
to
imply
that
he
can
only
get
the
designated
or
assigned
to
those
courts
and
not
to
the
supreme
court
at
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
i
think
in
a
sense,
a
retired
justice
of
the
supreme
court
is
no
longer
really
a
--
a
member
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
then
that's
--
that
--
that
i
think
is
the
distinction
whether
a
retired
judge
of
a
court
of
appeals
is
a
member
of
a
court.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
your
honor
the
reason
i
said
they
were
is
this
--
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
said
in
the
textile
mills
case.
in
that
case,
the
same
statute
said,
the
circuit
justice
is
competent
to
sit
as
a
member
of
this
court
and
this
court
held
that
he
was
therefore
a
component
part
of
the
court
although
the
circuit
judges
were
primarily
members
of
the
court
and
i
was
adopting
the
language
this
court
said.
this
court
said
that
because
the
circuit
justice
was
qualified
--
was
competent
--
precisely
the
same
language
was
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
was
competent
to
sit
as
a
member
of
the
court.
he
was
therefore,
was
competent
to
sit
as
a
judge
of
the
court.
he
was
therefore,
a
component
part
of
the
court.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
it
used
the
word
component
part.
i
was
using
the
same
language.
i
didn't
--
did
want
to
make
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
any
distinction.
i
was
using
the
same
language
this
court
had
used.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
but
in
the
textile
mills
case,
this
court
did
say
that.
i
believe
i
have
it
--
i
have
it
in
my
--
well,
yes,
here
it
is.
it
was
in
a
footnote.
it
says,
“in
this
connection,
it
should
be
noted
that
section
120
of
the
judicial
code
makes
the
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
a
supreme
court
assigned
to
each
circuit
competent
to
sit
as
judges
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
within
their
respective
circuits.”
that's
why
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
composed
primarily
of
circuit
judges,
the
circuit
justice
is
made
a
“component
part”
of
that
court.
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
i
think
he
could,
sir.
i
think
that's
what
textile
mills
held.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
into
the
legislative
history
of
this
a
little
bit.
and
i
think
that's
precisely
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
--
what
they
tried
to
enact.
in
the
textile
mills
case,
you
utterly
recall,
the
question
was
of
course
whether
the
court
could
sit
en
banc.
and
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
it
could
sit
en
banc,
this
court
said
it's
obvious
that
the
three-judge
limitation
cannot
be
applied
liter
--
applied
literally
because
some
circuits
have
more
than
three
judges.
it
also
said
and
that's
a
remark
i
was
just
reading
from.
in
this
connection,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
are
also
competent
to
sit
as
members
of
the
court.
they're
component
parts
of
the
court
and
in
its
decision,
it
equated
competency
to
sit
on
the
court
with
competency
to
perform
its
most
important
function,
to
decide
cases
and
therefore
said,
all
judges
competent
to
sit
on
the
court
are
competent
to
sit
en
banc
and
decide
a
case.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
if
the
active
members
of
the
court
decide
that
they
want
him
to
because
the
authority
to
assign
judges
to
the
court
in
its
divisions
resides
in
the
active
judges
of
a
court
under
section
46.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no
sir.
he
becomes
competent
to
sit
as
a
judge
of
the
court
not
an
active
member
of
it
and
i
say
--
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well
--
well,
i'm
not
quoting
it
out.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
the
active
members
of
the
court
of
--
on
--
i'm
adopting
the
same
view
this
court
did
in
the
textile
mills
case.
the
active
members
of
the
court
are
primarily
the
court.
they're
defined
as
such.
they
have
the
authority
of
assigning
to
the
court
and
its
divisions
any
judge
or
justice
who
is
competent
to
sit
as
a
member
of
the
court.
and
i
say
that
the
active
judges
of
the
court
have
the
power
if
they
desire
to
call
in
--
to
take
any
judge
who's
competent
under
section
43
(b)
and
permit
him
to
sit
on
a
court
or
its
divisions
or
with
the
--
with
the
active
judges
en
banc.
i
think
that's
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
also,
it's
what
--
it's
what
was
intended.
i'd
like
to
point
this
out,
your
honor
that
there
is
--
there
is
considerable
legislative
history
on
this
which
indicates
that
was
intended.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
before
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
section
120
made
only
the
chief
justice
and
the
associate
justice
--
justices
of
the
supreme
court
assigned
to
each
circuit
competent
to
sit
as
judges
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
then
the
district
judges
could
sit
to
fill
out
a
three-judge
court.
that
--
that
obviously
was
not
involved
here.
now,
when
43
(b)
was
revised,
the
revisers
in
their
notes
--
the
revisers
in
their
note
provided
that
the
provision
of
section
212
of
title
28
u.s.c.
for
a
three-judge
court
of
appeals
was
permissive
and
did
not
limit
the
power
of
the
court
to
sit
en
banc.
thus,
subsection
(b),
and
that's
the
section
i'm
talking
about.
thus,
subsection
(b)
reflects
the
present
status
of
the
law,
namely
that
the
court
is
composed
of
not
only
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
in
active
service
or
whom
there
more
--
be
more
than
three.
but
the
circuit
justice
or
justices
and
judges
who
maybe
assigned
or
designated
to
the
court,
see
textile
mills
security
corporation
v.
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
and
all
the
revisers
did
when
they
revised
43
(b)
was
include
the
new
class
of
judges
who
could
be
designated
and
assigned
to
the
court
and
gave
them
the
same
competency,
and
intended
to
give
them
the
same
competency
to
sit
with
the
court
en
bank
that
this
court
held
the
circuit
justice
had
under
the
former
section
120.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes
sir.
it's
quoted
on
section
35
and
36.
now,
the
reviser's
note
is
at
the
bottom
of
35
of
my
main
brief.
and
now
--
now,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
this
case
of
(inaudible).
i
think
it's
very
important
because
it
correlates
all
the
cases
in
which
there
were
mandatory
jurisdictional
statutes.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
pointed
out
and
that's
on
page
27
of
my
brief.
i
have
that.
the
court
pointed
out,
this
was
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia.
“that
it
was
authorized
to
call
in
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
sit
with
the
court
while
a
vacancy
exists.”
then
it
says,
that's
on
page
27,
“between
the
submission
of
a
case
and
its
final
disposition,
weeks
may
intervene.”
and
it
goes
on
and
says
--all
right,
yes.
“and
if
during
that
period,
the
justice
whose
place
the
additional
justice
had
taken
must
remain
--
remain
away
from
the
court
although
ready
to
act,
it
would
greatly
impede,
the
dispatch
of
the
public
business
here.”
ever
since
the
organization
of
the
court,
it
has
been
the
practice
for
the
additional
justice
to
participate
in
the
opinions
and
judgments
in
cases
argued
before
the
court
while
he
was
on
the
bench
although
the
regular
justice
whose
place
he
had
been
appointed
to
fill
had
returned
to
his
duties
before
the
judgments
ran
out.
the
right
of
the
additional
justice
to
do
so
has
never
been
questioned
by
anyone
so
far
as
we
know.
now,
they
point
out
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
sir.
the
statute
says
he
can
sit
while
the
vacancy
exists
and
this
is
the
case
where
he
no
longer
can
sit
because
the
judge
whose
place
he
was
filling
has
returned
and
the
court
says,
nevertheless,
he
can't
sit.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
the
--
these
are
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
sir,
these
are
--
these
are
cases
under
other
--
these
are
cases
under
other
jurisdictional
statutes.
no,
this
was
before
296.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
and
the
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
there
were
then.
now,
the
district
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
just
like
the
other
circuits.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that
--
that's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
quite
correct.
but
--
but
your
honor,
--
that
--
that
was
not
the
point
before
the
case
here.
the
point
here
was,
they
were
discussing
actually
the
general
effect
of
jurisdictional
statutes
under
which
an
authority
of
a
judge
has
ended.
they
said
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
they
said
the
authority
has
ended
and
they
went
through
all
the
state
statutes
and
said
it
doesn't
matter.
every
court,
they
pointed
out
there
are
courts
always
interpret
such
statutes
as
permitting
a
judge
to
finish
a
case
he
heard
as
a
member
of
the
court
en
bank
or
as
a
member
of
the
court.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
a
member
of
the
court
even
though
his
authority
ended.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes
it
does.
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
supports
the
position
of
the
court
below.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
that
--
that's
quite
right.
what
i
--
what
i'm
saying
is,
i
adopted
the
language
of
this
court.
and
i
think
more
properly
speaking,
i'd
say
that
section
43
(b)
makes
him
competent
without
qualification
to
sit
as
a
member
of
the
court
and
that's
what
--
that's
really
what
i
meant.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
and
i
was
using
this
court's
language
because
they
said
it's
a
component
--
you
say
it's
a
component
part
of
the
court.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
sir.
our
chief
argument
is
--
that's
one
of
our
arguments.
the
chief
argument
is
on
the
point
that
a
judge's
--
that
a
judge's
authority
does
not
end
as
a
member
of
the
court
that
a
--
when
his
general
authority
ends,
he
is
always
permitted
to
decide
cases
that
he
heard
as
a
member
of
the
court.
that's
our
chief
point
and
we
found
that
every
case
in
every
state
has
decided
that
way.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
if
(voice
overlap)
the
statute
isn't
clear
and
unambiguous
terms
said
or
otherwise,
i
assume
it
would
not
be
true
but
the
courts
have
been
always
refused
to
interpret
a
statute
that
way
unless
it
was
very
clear
that
the
legislature
had
so
intended.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
only
--
though
i've
said
that
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
they
actually
have
so
held
and
i
think
i've
read
all.
they've
always
said
the
language
is
not
clear
enough
so
as
to
lead
us
to
believe
that
the
legislature
intended
so
capricious
a
result,
a
result
which
would
so
--
as
to
badly
interfere
with
the
administration
of
justice
as
to
take
a
judge
who
heard
a
case
off
the
court.
now,
they
--
they
have
said
that
the
legislature's
intention
was
unmistakable.
we
hold
the
other
way.
but
in
the
most
mandatory
statute,
they
said,
“we
don't
believe
it.”
and
they've
even
said,
“we
don't
believe
it
even
when
the
language
literally
says
that.
we
don't
believe
that's
what
congress
intended.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
oh
yes.
also
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
judges
who
were
assigned
must
determine
it.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
status
of
the
judges
may
--
must
be
the
same.but
of
course
the
function
of
a
court
is
to
determine
cases
but
we
say
the
justice
in
the
other
jurisdictional
statutes
are
the
change
in
status
of
the
judge,
did
not
disqualify
him.
we
say
that
change
in
the
status
of
judge
medina
did
not
disqualify
him.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
quite
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
but
say
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
because
--
because,
your
honor
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
your
honor,
that's
precisely
--
that
was
precisely
the
point
of
judge
hincks'
opinion
and
i
agree
with
it
thoroughly.
for
almost
a
hundred
years,
this
court
starting
with
the
case
in
the
united
states
against
kirby
which
i've
cited
has
said
that
statutes
which
lead
to
an
absurd
and
unreasonable
result
should
not
be
literally
read
so
as
to
read
to
that
--
lead
to
that
result.
they
said,
“we
are
not
to
interpret
such
statutes.
we
want
to
make
exceptions.
we
need
exceptions
into
them.”
now,
even
the
dissenting
judges
in
this
case
who
felt
that
they
were
compelled
by
a
--
what
i
consider
a
pseudo
literal
reading
of
section
46
(c)
to
object
that
judge
medina
is
sitting
on
a
court
said,
“they
regarded
judges
in
his
position,
their
--their
participation
in
such
cases
as
desirable
and
beneficial
but
they
doubted
the
wisdom
of
excluding
a
judge
who
had
sat
on
the
court
from
--
from
participating
in
its
decision.”
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
following
the
traditional
way
in
which
this
court
has
interpreted
the
legislation,
this
sort
of
an
exception
or
this
sort
of
a
policy
should
be
read
into
it.
we
ought
not
to
say
that
if
in
other
cases,
it
would
lead
to
a
bad
result,
we
can
cross
those
bridges
when
we
come
to
it
but
we
are
not
to
say
now
that
where
it
would
lead
to
an
obviously
good
result,
we
should
bar
the
judge
from
sitting.
and
i
think
that's
what
every
court
has
done
in
four
circuits.
they've
always
done
that.
they
have
never
let
the
new
judge
come
in
because
that
would
obviously
require
a
rehearing.
how
can
he
come
in
as
a
sort
of
second
class
member
of
a
court?
he
has
to
know
what
went
on
to
intelligently
decide
the
case
and
they
won't
bar
the
old
judge
from
participating
in
the
case.
every
single
case
has
said
that.
now,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
take
all
the
time
because
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
sir,
i
think
it's
exactly
the
same
because
i
want
to
point
out
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
this
connection,
there's
another
statute
which
says
that
no
retired
judge
shall
perform
any
judicial
duties
without
being
designated
or
stand
assigned.
and
we
pointed
out
that
judge
median
decided
36
cases,
three-judge
cases
without
a
designation
of
assignment.
judge
magruder
decided
25.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
yes
but
i
think
it's
a
relevant
point
because
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
same
principle.
there,
a
statute
in
mandatory
terms
as
the
--
a
judge
shall
perform
no
judicial
duties
and
yet
--
yet
he's
been
permitted
to
because
it
was
a
sensible
and
wise
thing
to
do
if
he
heard
the
case
in
every
one
of
the
circuits.
this
has
arisen
in
10
of
the
11
circuits.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
discussed.
it
is
--
it's
not
before
this
court
now
in
the
goldfine
case
in
a
petition
for
certiorari.
well,
i
have
--
i
have
cited
in
there
cases
in
10
of
the
11
circuits
in
which
--
in
which
the
practice
has
been
followed.
and
those
are
the
only
cases
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well
--
well,
the
government
explained
this
to
the
court
below
saying
that
designation
and
assignment
was
a
designation
and
assignment
that
took
place
before
they
retired,
their
assignment
to
the
case.
that's
what
the
government
said
to
the
court
below.we
have
that
quoted
in
--
that
statement
quoted
in
our
brief.
and
that
apparently
is
the
theory.
that's
how
they
explained
the
theory
that
if
the
judge
has
been
designated
and
assigned
to
a
case
before
he
retired,
his
designation
and
assignment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
that's
exactly
what
happened.
we
have
the
cases.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
your
honor,
yes
because
they
were
assigned
--
they
were
assigned
to
all
these
cases
before
they
retired.
these
are
all
cases
in
which
they
--
they
were
assigned.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
but
they
didn't
complete.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
i'm
sorry.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
these
were
all
cases
in
the
same
position
as
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
no.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
oh
no,
no.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
no,
your
honor.
these
are
cases
in
which
they
were
assigned.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
why
i
think
the
parallel
exist
(voice
overlap)
between.
now,
the
only
other
point
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
i
think
there
is
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
i'll
give
that
to
you.
well,
the
second
paragraph
of
2
--
of
295
says
all
designations
and
assignments
of
justices
and
judges
shall
be
filed
with
the
clerk
and
entered
on
the
minutes
of
the
courts
from
and
to
which
it's
made.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
well,
i
think
it
involves
both
i
would
assume.
there's
nothing
that
indicates
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
in
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
but
in
the
first
circuit,
he
sat
in
25
cases
in
those
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
sir.
not
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
that's
right.
and
there
are
25
of
those.
now
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
no,
no
it
is
not
because
if
--
it's
in
the
--
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
it's
in
the
code.
mr.
arthur
m.
becker
and
--
that's
the
only
point
my
opponent
--
my
colleague
will
discuss
the
thing.
