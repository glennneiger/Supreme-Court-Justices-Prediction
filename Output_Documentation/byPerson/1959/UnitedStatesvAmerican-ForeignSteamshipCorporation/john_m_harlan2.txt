justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
put
that
entirely
clearly
if
judge
clark
had
given
the
judgment
being
a
formal
designation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
still
would
say
he
would
be
disqualified.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
read
over
into
the
last
sentence,
occurred
and
determined
by
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
--
i
take
that
your
view
is
that
the
judicial
counsel
which
means
before
court
of
appeals,
i
can't
get
use
to
could
not
under
this
statute
pass
a
an
order
saying
that
all
petitions
for
a
rehearing
en
banc
are
to
be
referred
to
and
determined
by
the
panel
which
heard
the
case.
do
you
say
that
would
not
be
permissible?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
granted
or
denied,
either
one.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
as
we
refer
you
could
do
that
on
the
second
circuit
informally
for
a
considerable
period.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
had
been
reported
it
was
informal
but
i
am
sure
the
other
circuits
that
act
exactly
in
that
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
say
that
that
could
not
be
done
under
--
under
your
view
of
the
statute,
you
say,
“don't
agree.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
could
be
done
--
it
could
be
done?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
put
his
hypothetical
to
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
had
an
order
of
the
judicial
counsel
delegating
to
the
panel
that
it
heard
a
case,
the
power
to
decide
deny
or
grant
a
petition
for
rehearing,
which
i
take
it
you
say,
would
be
permissible
under
western
union
pacific,
so
far
are
we
together?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
i
used
the
judicial
counsel
as
a
thumbnail
for
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
all
the
judges.
and
so
far,
you
would
say
that
that
would
be
permissible
for
the
circuit
to
do,
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
to
do.
now,
supposing
you
have
a
panel.
it
is
composed
of
three
judges
one
of
whom
has
retired,
retired
after
the
decision
of
the
case
but
before
the
motion
for
rehearing
en
banc
is
acted
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
he
try
--
could
he
participate
in
the
vote
or
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
he
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
he
--
could
he
--
could
he
vote
--
could
he
vote
to
grant
or
deny
the
petition
for
a
rehearing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
could.
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
sit
on
the
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
in
other
words
what
you
are
saying
is
this
that
although
a
retired
judge
could
participate
in
the
--
the
act
of
granting
or
denying
the
petition
for
rehearing,
a
judge
who
is
an
active
judge
after
the
petition
for
rehearing
has
granted
en
banc
cannot
participate
in
the
decision
on
the
merits
after
he
is
retired?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
hope
you
work
out
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
says
i
figured
to
leave
a
officer
to
justice.[laughter]
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that
report,
however,
it
doesn't
purport
to
deal
with
the
particular
questions
we
have
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that
report
deals
with
is
desirability
of
having
retired
judges
sit
in
en
banc.
they
don't
direct
themselves
at
all
to
the
proposition
of
active
judge.
the
man
was
active
at
the
time
the
en
banc
courts
convened
were
carrying
afterwards.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
understand
in
that
way.
may
be
i
read
it
wrong.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
but
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
see
that
it's
relevant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
there
is
nothing
in
judge
hincks
opinion
to
suggest
that
the
retired
judge,
retired
before
an
en
banc
order
is
put
down
and
composed
the
court
the
en
banc
court
initially,
that
he
--
he
isn't
suggesting
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
panel
divided
the
en
banc
had
gone
the
other
way
and
medina
and
hincks
were
stuck
with
their
original
decision
in
your
favor,
do
you
think
you'd
be
up
here?
[laughter]
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
practical
question?
assuming
you
prevail
here,
where
there
is
the
consequence,
the
judge
one
who
is
vacated,
he
goes
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
could
there
be
a
new
en
banc
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
the
government's
deal
would
be,
there's
no
legal
impediment
to
the
court
ordering
a
new
en
banc
hearing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
mind
giving
me
the
names
of
those
three
cases.
i
just
want
to
check
them
off
in
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
those
three
cases
you
were
referring
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
if
they're
going
--
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
calling
somebody
else
in
to
sit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
allowing
somebody
who
is
not
an
active
judge
of
the
circuit
to
sit
on
the
petition,
are
two
different
things.
in
order
to
support
your
broader
proposition,
you
have
to
read
the
last
sentence
saying
that
a
court
en
banc
shall
include
all
active
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
circuit
judges
instead
consist
of.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
proposition.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
have
to
go
far
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
see
why
you'd
take
on
more
baggage
enough
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that
quoted
on
your
brief,
mr.
becker.
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
first
sentence
of
46
(c),
supposing
that
and
read
the
toward
a
division
of
not
more
than
three
active
judges.
would
your
position
be
any
different
with
respect
to
the
competency
of
a
retired
judge
to
participate
in
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
government
makes
no
point
about
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
not
a
very
powerful
argument
really
because
if
the
rule
went
as
the
government
would
have
it,
it's
not
a
very
serious
matter
to
a
judge
sitting
on
a
case
to
accommodate
his
retirement
to
the
finishing
of
the
(voice
overlap).
