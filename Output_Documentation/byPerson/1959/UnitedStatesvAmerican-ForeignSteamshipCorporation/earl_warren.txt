mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elman,
before
i
get
to
that
may
i
ask,
was
there
any
formal
assignment
of
--
of
the
judge
to
--
to
act
in
this
case
after
he
retired?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
going
to
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
decision
would
have
been
the
same,
they
could've
gotten
the
--
gotten
the
rehearing.
it
couldn't
have
happened,
if
that
third
vote
hadn't
been
in
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fort.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh,
yes.
mr.
becker,
excuse
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
agree
with
mr.
elman
that
if
--
if
judge
medina
was
entitled
to
sit
in
this
case
that
any
assigned
judge,
whether
he
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
from
some
other
circuit
or
the
district
judge
or
does
the
court
of
claims,
he
would
be
in
exactly
the
same
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
differentiation
do
you
make?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
language
do
you
rely
on
in
46
(c)
to
things
that
that
included?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
46
(c)
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
is
there
any
other
section
than
46
(c)
that
defines
the
court
en
banc?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
may
i
just
pursue
this
one
question
so
far
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
then
--
then
you
would
agree
with
mr.
elman
to
this
extent
at
least
that
if
the
--
if
the
court,
the
active
members
of
the
court
wanted
to
do
it,
they
could
assign
a
visiting
district
judge
or
visiting
judge
of
a
court
of
appeals
or
another
circuit
or
court
of
claims
or
--
to
the
court
en
banc?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer
that
after
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
only
instance
you've
ever
--
you've
been
able
to
find
that
it
was
ever
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
grant
the
rehearing
on
those
cases
or
denied
them.
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
they
acted
en
banc
did
they
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
however,
they
didn't
sit.
you
--
you
couldn't
find
them
in
their
seats.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
does
it
follow
that
--
that
they
can
have
--
sit
with
them
en
banc
anyone
they
want?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
go
right
ahead
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you're
going
--
if
you're
not
going
to
go
that
far,
how
--
what
language
do
you
--
do
you
rely
on
in
46
(c)?
what
--
what
permits
you
to
differentiate
between
the
judge
and
judgement
on
his
position
and
--
and
one
who
is
assigned
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
not
only
to
this
circuit
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
for
the
district
court
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
would
you
say
that
applied
to
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
found
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
found
any
instances
where
it
has
been
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
distinction
from
the
point
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
that
you
attest
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
instrument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
is
that?
i
--
i'm
not
quite
familiar.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
is
there
--
would
you
--
would
you
send
that
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
know,
but
you
say
the
assignment
has
already
taken
place
that
they
--
that
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
sat
and
it
was
assigned
to
them
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
they
worked
on
it
and
so
forth
but
didn't
do
it
--
it
didn't
--
the
judgement
didn't
come
down
by
the
time
they
retired.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
it's
only
a
matter
of
policy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
he?
is
he?
now,
what
--
what
does
43
(b)
say?
it
says,
“each
court
of
appeals
shall
--
shall
consist
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
active
service.
the
circuit
justice
and
justices
or
judges
designated
or
assigned
shall
also
be
competent
to
sit
as
judges
of
the
court.”
but
it
does
not
say
that
they
are
still
members
of
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
assignment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
for
the
--
for
the
purpose
and
which
assigned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
would
that
lead
to
you
to
believe
that
the
circuit
justice
is
--
is
an
active
judge
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
court?
would
he
--
could
he
sit
as
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
en
banc?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
you
believe
that
there
are
--
are
three
or
four
retired
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
large
circuit
and
the
chief
judge
also
brings
in
--
in
two
or
three
outsiders
to
sit
in
certain
litigation
that
all
of
them
can
sit
with
the
active
members
of
the
court
en
banc?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
it's
--
is
it
your
opinion
that
--
that
whenever
a
judge
is
assigned
to
--
to
perform
duties
in
the
court,
that
for
all
purposes,
he
becomes
an
active
member
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
how
do
you
read
out
the
active
members?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
provided
by
statute,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
section
296
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
apply
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
296.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
are
some
--
some
special
statutes
about
who
can
sit
and
how
they
can
act
in
the
district
of
columbia,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
there
are
certain
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
judges
that
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
who
--
who
are
here,
who
can
sit
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
district
of
columbia
who
cannot
sit
in
--
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
member
of
the
court,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
section
296
says
that
specifically.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
still
don't
see
how
you
equate
that
to
making
him
a
member
of
a
--
an
active
member
of
a
court
which
is
defined
by
the
statute
as
being
those
--
those
judges
who
are
active
judges
of
the
circuit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wonder
how
you
--
how
you
justify
the
case
that
you
mentioned
a
little
while
ago
where
you
say
two
--
two
judges
sat
on
the
--
on
the
case
and
then
retired
later
and
their
positions
were
filled
before
the
decision
was
rendered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
two
who
were
--
who
filled
the
positions
were
barred
from
service
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
court.
and
the
old
--
old
ones
were
permitted
to
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
--
how
can
--
how
could
you
read
those
two
new
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
on
that
of
statute
if
the
statute
says
all
active
members
of
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
that
been
considered
--
had
that
been
considered
by
the
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
argued
as
to
whether
--
whether
any
judge
can
sit
on
--on
any
federal
court
without
assignment
unless
he
is
the
judge
of
that
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
then
this
language
in
43
(b)
is
--
is
--
supporting
to
you
and
might
just
as
well
--
just
as
well
write
it
out
(inaudible).
thus,
in
the
--
each
court
of
appeals
shall
consist
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
in
active
serve
--
service.
the
circuit
justice
and
justices
or
judges
designated
or
assigned
shall
also
be
competent
to
sit
as
judges
of
the
court.
now,
if
they
--
if
they
don't
have
to
be
designated
or
assigned,
what
is
that
language
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know
but
you're
talking
about
doing
it
in
30
cases,
and
part
of
one
judge
and
25
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
it
happened
but
i'm
--
does
that
make
it
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
they
didn't
--
but
they
didn't
complete?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't'
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
yes.
and
i
thought
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
were
talking
about
new
cases
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
after
they
retired.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
