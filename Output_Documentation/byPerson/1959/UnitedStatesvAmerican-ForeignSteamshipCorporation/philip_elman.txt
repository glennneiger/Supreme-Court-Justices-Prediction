mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
the
problem
concerns
the
proper
composition
of
a
court
of
appeals
when
it
decides
a
case
en
banc,
as
distinguished
from
a
three-judge
division
or
panel.
and
the
question
is
whether
section
46
(c)
of
title
20-a
which
is
set
out
in
the
government's
brief
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
whether
that
section
which
defines
the
composition
of
a
court
en
banc
as
consisting
of
all
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit.
whether
that
section
precludes
a
circuit
judge,
who
retires
after
a
case
has
been
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
while
the
case
is
still
under
advisement
under
consideration.
whether
he
is
precluded
under
the
statute
from
participating
in
the
decision
of
the
case
because
it
is
retirement
which
in
this
particular
instance
occurred
some
five
months
before
the
case
was
decided.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
mr.
justice,
he
was.
now,
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
case
was
not
--
the
case
was
not
heard
on
oral
argument
before
the
court
en
banc.
the
oral
argument
was
before
the
three-judge
panel.
and
the
case
was
submitted
on
the
briefs
to
the
en
banc
before
it.
now,
before
going
in
to
the
details
of
the
facts,
i
think,
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
have
in
mind
the
exact
language
of
the
statutory
provision
governing
en
banc
proceedings
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
believe
so.
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
the
records
of
the
court
--
clerk's
office
and
record
in
this
case
are
concerned,
there
is
no
designation
in
assignment
and
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
philip
elman
we're
willing
to
--
we're
willing
to
assume
that
if
it
were
proper
for
the
retired
judge
in
this
case
to
participate
in
the
decision
en
banc,
if
he
did
have
a
designation
in
assignment,
we're
willing
to
assume
that
such
a
designation
was
made.
so,
if
we
make
absolutely
no
contention
based
upon
the
absence
of
the
designation
or
assignment
so
far
the
en
banc
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
day
he
retired.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
--
the
reason
we
say
that,
is
that
section
46
(c),
we
think
in
terms
made
judge
medina
from
the
date
of
his
retirement
incompetent
to
sit
in
an
en
banc
court
as
distinguished
from
a
three-judge
panel
court.
now,
section
46
(c)
set
out
on
page
two
of
our
brief
at
the
bottom
provides
that
cases
in
controversy
shall
be
heard
and
determined
by
court
or
division
of
not
more
than
three
judges,
unless
a
hearing
or
rehearing
before
the
court
en
banc
is
ordered
by
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
who
are
in
active
service.
now,
that
latter
clause
was
before
the
court
in
the
western
pacific
railroad
case
which
was
here
several
terms
ago
and
the
court
held
there
that
the
statute
is
a
grant
of
power
to
the
courts
of
appeals
to
sit
en
banc.
it
does
not
prescribe
any
particular
procedure
which
the
courts
of
appeals
must
follow
in
determining
whether
a
rehearing
en
banc
should
be
ordered.
it
doesn't
require
that
a
petition
for
rehearing
be
filed
and
so
on.
the
only
limitation
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals'
power
to
sit
en
banc
is
concern
or
in
determining
whether
to
sit
en
banc,
is
that
the
hearing
or
rehearing
must
be
ordered
by
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
who
are
in
active
service.
and
then
comes
the
sentence
which
we
think
is
dispositive
here.
finding
the
composition
of
the
en
banc
court
if
it
does
decide
to
sit
that
way,
a
court
en
banc
shall
consist
of
all
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit.
now,
there's
no
problem
here
about
judge
medina's
being
a
circuit
judge.
there's
no
problem
about
his
being
a
circuit
judge
of
the
second
circuit.
the
keyword
there
is
“active”.
he
was
active
when
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
court
en
banc,
he
was
retired
when
the
case
was
decided.
the
statute
says
cases
and
controversy
shall
be
heard
and
determined
by
a
court
as
defined.
the
government's
position
in
a
nutshell
is
that
the
court
en
banc
must
be
properly
constituted
not
only
at
the
time
the
case
is
heard
but
at
the
time
it's
determined.
and
that
judge
medina
at
the
time
the
case
was
determined
by
the
court
en
banc
was
not
an
active
circuit
judge
of
the
circuit.
and
for
that
reason,
the
judgement
entered
by
that
improperly
constituted
en
banc
court
was
invalid.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir
we
do.
but
even
if
--
even
if
that's
--
even
if
the
language
heard
and
determined
wasn't
specifically
on
the
statute.
we
would
--
we
would
not
think
that
would
make
to
--
too
much
of
a
difference
because
after
all
the
function
of
a
court,
the
one
function
of
a
court
to
which
everything
else
is
ancillary
is
the
function
to
decide.
that's
why
a
court
exists
and
the
crucial
action
of
the
court
is
the
decision
and
congress
granted
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
sit
en
banc
and
to
decide
cases
en
banc
and
it
entrusted
that
power
only
to
all
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit.
mr.
philip
elman
the
western
pacific
railroad
case
makes
it
clear
that
the
panel,
the
three-judge
panel,
no
matter
by
--
how
it's
constituted,
the
three
retired
circuit
judges
on
the
panel
may
initiate
the
process
of
rehearing
en
banc.
and
conceivably
under
the
western
pacific
railroad
case
may
decide
against
submitting
it
to
the
entire
court
if
all
the
act
of
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
are
willing
to
permit
such
a
procedure,
so
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
opinion
is
extremely
broad.
i
think
it
was
written
as
a
--
as
a
comprehensive
guide
to
the
courts
of
appeals
in
formulating
procedure.
mr.
philip
elman
i
couldn't
say.
mr.
philip
elman
so
far
as
this
mediocre
--
mr.
philip
elman
when
--
if
you
say
the
immediate
problem
and
mean
that
problem
of
judge
medina
participating
a
decision
en
banc
here,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
perfectly
clear
--
mr.
philip
elman
and
nobody
thought
of
that.
mr.
philip
elman
we
think,
that
a
rehearing
en
banc
can
be
ordered
only
by
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
who
are
in
active
service.
only
a
certain
--
an
active
circuit
judge
of
the
circuit
may
cast
an
effective
vote
to
grant
to
order
rehearing.
it
does
not
follow
that
he
may
not
--
that
a
retired
judge
or
an
assigned
judge
may
not
participate
in
the
deliberations
preceding
that
action
of
the
court.
mr.
philip
elman
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
he
had
an
active
share
or
not.
mr.
philip
elman
a
retired
judge
can
vote
to
deny,
it
doesn't
under
our
view,
the
statute
does
not
granted
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
the
panel
may
vote
to
deny.
it
certainly
may
not
vote
to
grant
rehearing
en
banc
because
that
can
be
done
under
the
statute
only
by
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
in
the
circuit
who
are
in
active
service.
there
is
nothing
in
western
pacific
that
says
that
statues
can
be
construed
or
should
be
construed
otherwise.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
two
of
the
active
three
--
two
the
active
three
couldn't
vote
to
grant
a
hearing
en
banc.you
have
to
have
the
--
all
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
who
are
in
active
service.
mr.
philip
elman
a
majority
circuit
judge
of
the
circuit
not
of
the
panel.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
right.
mr.
philip
elman
if
there
two
or
four?
mr.
philip
elman
two
of
four
could
--
would
not
be
majority
if
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
if
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
consist
of
four
active
circuit
judges,
only
three
could
order
a
rehearing
en
banc.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
there's
nothing
ambiguous
about
it.
now,
the
important
point
is
that
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
rehearing
en
banc
is
granted
or
denied
because
so
far
as
denial
is
concerned
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
which
--
which
precludes
the
participation
of
a
retired
judge
or
a
judge,
circuit
judge,
from
another
circuit
from
--
from
--
from
saying
to
the
--
to
the
entire
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
think,
there's
anything
in
the
statute
advices
his
discussion
of
the
thing.
there's
been
a
--
the
case
where
the
judges
were
qualified
to
vote.
the
statute
deals
with
who
votes
not
who
talks
to
whom.
there's
nothing
improper
in
the
--
in
--
in--
mr.
philip
elman
but
the
statute
doesn't
bar
it.
mr.
philip
elman
we
don't
--
mr.
philip
elman
we're
not
here
arguing
that
--
that
the
statute
prohibits
talk.
all
we
are
--
all
we
are
arguing
here
is
does
statute
prohibit
to
vote.
if
the
consequence
of
that
decision
is
that
it
prohibits
talk,
the
question
may
arise
--
may
arise
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
elman
you
say
determined,
i
--
i
ask
what
do
you
mean
grant
or
deny
or
both?
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
don't
think
that
even
a
judicial
counsel
with
all
its
broad
powers
--
mr.
philip
elman
grant.
mr.
philip
elman
we
have
--
we
have
never
found
the
case.
we
have
not
found
the
case
of
any
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
if
that
is
done,
it's
done
with
the
concurrence
and
authorization
of
a
majority
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
--
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
no.
if
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
who
are
in
active
service
are
willing
to
delegate
to
--
to
the
panel
the
function
of
granting
rehearings
en
banc,
i
think,
that's
--
whether
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
philip
elman
this
may
begin
--
this
maybe
cutting
it
very
fine
with
mr.
justice.
but
the
statute
gives
power
to
a
majority
of
the
circuit
--
judges
of
the
circuit
who
are
in
active
service.
they
and
only
they
have
the
--
have
the
power
to
order
a
rehearing
or
hearing
before
the
court
en
banc
if
they
choose
to
allow
that
power
to
be
exercised
by
a
three-judge
panel
acting
for
the
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
who
are
in
active
service.
i
think,
and
i
must
say
that
it
isn't
presented
by
this
case
and
i
maybe
speaking
perjuriously.
but
i
would
suppose
that
it
determines
an
interpretation
that
western
pacific
railroad
case
would
be
that
that
could
be
done,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
here,
because
in
this
case
you
do
not
have
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
who
are
in
active
service
saying
that
we're
going
to
authorize
a
retired
judge
to
vote
in
a
decision
of
the
merits
en
banc.
now,
in
this
case
the
active
judges
of
the
circuit
in
active
who
--
who
participated
in
the
en
banc
proceedings
were
evenly
divided.
you
had
judges
clark
and
waterman
on
one
side,
judges
hincks
and
moore
on
the
other,
judge
lumbard,
the
fifth
active
circuit
judge
who
had
been
united
states
attorney
disqualified
himself.
so
the
active
circuit
judges
were
evenly
divided
and
the
matter
was
decided
by
the
vote
of
the
retired
judge,
judge
medina.
so
that
everything
that
we
have
been
talking
about
in
relation
of
the
--
to
possible
scope
of
the
--
of
the
delegation
of
the
power
of
the
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
in
relation
of
granting
petitions
for
rehearing
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
the
--
with
the
second
circuit
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i
--
i
think
i
may
have
--
i
may
have
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
not
appreciated
your
first
question
because
i
did
not
equate
the
judicial
counsel.
mr.
philip
elman
all
right.
as
long
as
you
--
as
long
as
you
have
the
power
being
exercised
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
by
the
circuit
judge,
there's
no
problem.
mr.
philip
elman
very
common
situation.
mr.
philip
elman
certainly
not.
mr.
philip
elman
no.
and
the
vote
to
grant
rehearing,
the
vote
of
--
of
the
--
could
he
sit
in
the
hearing
of
the
en
banc.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
no.
mr.
philip
elman
oh,
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
that's
what
i
said
about.
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i
--
i've
been
focusing,
mr.
justice
harlan,
on
the
--
on
the
question
which
is
presented
by
this
case
which
is
not
who
votes
on
whether
a
rehearing
should
be
ordered
or
not
but
who
sits
--
who
sits
on
the
court
which
decides.
mr.
philip
elman
because
there's
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
the
problem
of
how
you
--
how
you
work
out
the
procedures
for
--
for
ordering
or
not
--
or
denying
rehearing
en
banc
which
the
western
pacific
railroad
opinion
is
addressed
to
and
the
second
problem
presented
by
this
case
is
to
which
the
statute
as
--
as
--
as
we
read
it
are
clear.
once
rehearing
is
ordered
before
whom?
now,
judge
hincks
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
here
rely
on
section
43
(b)
of
the
48
code
which
we
have
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix,
page
30.
it's
also
quoted
by
judge
hincks
at
page
139
of
the
record.
and
that
provides
that
each
court
of
appeal
shall
consist
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
in
active
service.
the
circuit
justice
and
justices
or
judges
designated
or
assigned
shall
also
be
competent
to
sit
as
the
judges
of
the
court.
now,
judge
hincks
construed
section
43
(b)
in
relation
to
46
(c)
and
it
said
--
he
said
that
the
--
he
said
on
behalf
of
himself
and
judge
moore
and
judge
medina
that
under
43
(b),
any
judge
which
would
include
the
circuit
justice
and
any
justices
or
judges
designated
or
assigned,
any
judge
who's
competent
to
sit
with
the
court
of
appeals
is
also
a
member
of
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc.
now
first
of
all
that
--
that
is
a
rather
awkward
reading
of
its
statute.
43
(b)
defines
a
court
of
appeals
as
consisting
in
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
in
active
circuit
--
in
active
service.
that's
a
definition
of
who
is
a
member
of
the
court
of
appeals.
then
it
goes
on
to
authorize
other
judges
designated
and
assigned
to
sit
as
judges
of
the
court.
it
does
not
make
the
judges
who
are
designated
to
assign
members
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
46
(c)
dealing
specifically
with
en
banc
proceedings
says
that
a
court
en
banc
shall
consist
of
all
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit.
it
does
not
go
on
as
43
(b)
does
and
provide
that
the
--
the
circuit
justice
and
justices
or
judges
designated
or
assigned
shall
also
be
competent
to
sit
as
judges
of
the
en
banc
court.
now,
if
--
if
judge
hincks
is
right,
what
--
what
is
left
to
that
provision
of
46
(c)
if
any
justice,
any
judge
and
this
isn't
just
limited
to
circuit
judges,
this
isn't
limited
to
the
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit,
it
isn't
limited
to
district
judges,
it
applies
to
judges
of
the
court
of
claims,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
customs
court
whether
they're
retired,
whether
they're
active.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
when
they
were
retired.
the
scope
of
the
power
of
designation
and
assignment
is
extremely
broad.
it
covers
practically
every
federal
judge.
now,
if
any
federal
judge
active
or
retired
of
any
federal
court
is
competent
to
sit
as
an
--
as
a
member
of
the
en
banc
court
because
of
section
43
(b),
what
is
left
to
46
(c),
it
says
--
mr.
philip
elman
they
both
--
they
both
appear
in
the
1948
judicial
code.
mr.
philip
elman
46
(c)
came
into
the
statute
for
the
first
time
in
48
and
the
48
code
in
effect
codified
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
textile
mill
--
mills
case.
that
came
in
the
1948,
i
think
and
i
may
not
be
--
altogether
accurate
about
this.
my
--
my
feeling
is
that
43
(b)
goes
much
farther
back,
because
it
deals
with
designation
and
assignments
which
certainly
didn't
come
in
to
the
statute
of
1948,
it's
an
old
provision.
mr.
philip
elman
you're
suggesting
the
circuit
justice?
mr.
philip
elman
at
--
if
anyone
else
mr.
justice?
mr.
philip
elman
now,
that
would
cover
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
cutting
it
fine.
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
it
is
cutting
it
fine.
mr.
philip
elman
but
what
is
the
limit?
mr.
philip
elman
the
statute
says
the
court
en
banc
shall
consist
of
all
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit.
let's
assume
arguendo
that
that
also
includes
the
circuit
justice,
and
that
would
not
be
drawn
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
addition.
does
it
follow
that
it
also
includes
every
federal
judge
who
maybe
designated
and
assigned.
this
isn't
cutting
it
fine.
there
would
be
no
limit
on
the
size
of
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
and
it
would
reduce
the
purpose
of
en
banc
proceedings
to
an
utter
absurdity.
the
purpose
of
an
en
banc
proceeding
is
to
resolve
or
avoid
intra
circuit
conflicts.
en
banc
proceedings
are
--
are
not
the
rule,
they're
the
exception.
they
--
they
arise
in
a
situation
where,
as
judge
maris
put
it,
there's
a
serious
strain
within
the
court.
you
got
a
cut
--
one
panel
either
deciding
or
about
to
decide
a
case
in
a
particular
way.
other
judges
of
the
court
may
think
that
they
would
decide
the
matter
another
way,
suppose
they
sit
a
year
or
two
years
from
now
and
the
problem
arises,
what
is
--
what
do
they
do?
do
they
follow
the
panel
decision
with
which
they
disagree,
even
though
--
even
though
they
think
it's
wrong?
do
they
overrule
it?
now,
the
en
banc
proceeding
is
--
is
intended
to
avoid
that
kind
of
--
of
internal
family
disagreement
which
this
court
in
the
wisniewski
case,
i
believe
it's
pronounced,
said
it
was
the
problem
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
resolve
not
to
bring
here.
now,
who
should
sit
on
this
en
banc
court
to
lay
down
the
law
in
the
circuit
for
the
future
guidance
of
the
three-judge
panels
that
are
going
to
be
sitting?
should
it
be
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
retired
or
active
or
retired
district
judges?
now
in
this
very
case,
you
had
judge
leibell
sitting
on
the
original
panel
along
with
judge
hincks
and
judge
medina.
judge
leibell
was
a
retired
district
judge
sitting
by
designation
in
this
very
case.
he
withdrew
from
the
case
as
soon
as
the
rehearing
in
en
banc
question
arose.
now,
you
have
judge
hand,
judge
swan,
and
judge
chase
retired
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit.
none
of
them
has
ever
sat,
so
far
as
we
know,
in
any
court
convened
en
banc.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
another
important
fact.
mr.
philip
elman
after
his
--
in
the
case
in
which
rehearing
was
ordered
after
his
retirement?
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
know
the
case.
we've
looked
for
these
cases
and
--
and
the
only
case
that
we
have
found
in
which
this
problem
is
discussed
is
this
case.
now
it
was
--
it
was
--
it
appears
to
have
been
notice
in
two
ninth
circuit
cases.
and
of
course,
it
must
come
up
in
other
cases
from
time
to
time
but
so
far
as
we
know
there
hasn't
been
any
--
any
awareness
or
at
least
so
far
as
the
opinions
in
the
federal
report
reflected
that
awareness
isn't
shown.
now,
let
--
let
me
finish
on
--
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
justice,
this
is
not
our
suggestion.
we
think
that
the
statute
says
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit.
if
you
read
the
statute
the
way
it's
written,
there's
no
problem
at
all.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
light
--
the
light
which
is
cast
upon
it
by
section
43
(b)
here
is
that
if
you
read
43
(b)
into
46
(c)
so
that
any
federal
judge
of
any
court,
active
or
retired,
can
sit
with
the
--
with
the
en
banc
--
banc
court,
you
have
destroyed,
in
our
opinion,
the
very
valuable
purpose
of
the
en
banc
court,
which
is
to
have
the
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
lay
down
a
law,
a
limit
in
the
circuit,
eliminate
these
conflicts
real
or
potential.
if
--
if
it
would
--
it
would
in
our
view
distort
section
46
(c),
it
would
nullify,
it
would
leave
it
no
scope
and
--
and
--
and
it
would
have
no
sense
at
all.
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
views
you've
expressed
are
the
views
which
were
put
to
the
judicial
conference
at
its
annual
meeting
last
september.
the
judicial
conference
agreed
that
an
amendment
to
46
(c)
in
order
to
take
care
of
retired
judges
like
judge
hand,
judge
medina,
when
they
sit
on
the
original
panel
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
sit
on
the
en
banc
court.
it
was
--
that
was
a
fine
idea
and
they
proposed
an
amendment
to
section
46
(c).
the
judicial
conference
report
also
says
that
is
was
the
view
of
the
committees
on
court
administration
and
revision
of
the
law
that
under
the
statute,
that's
the
statute
as
it's
now,
not
as
it's
going
to
be
amended.
under
the
statute
only
judges
who
are
in
regular
active
service,
that
is
those
who
have
not
retired,
are
the
judges
in
active
service
to
which
the
statutes
refer.
now,
it
maybe
that
1948,
when
this
--
when
46
(c)
was
enacted,
nobody
thought
about
this
problem.
they
--
perhaps
they
wasn't
as
acute
as
--
a
shortage
of
active
judges
as
there
is
now.
there
weren't
as
many
retired
judges
sitting
actively
as
there
are
today
and
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
section
43
(b)
means
with
judge
hincks
and
though
it
mean
--
meant
in
this
case,
there
would
be
no
problem,
he
would
need
any
amendment
to
46
(c),
because
any
judge
who
could
be
designated
and
assigned
which
would
certainly
include
a
retired
circuit
judge
who
sat
on
the
original
panel
could
be
--
could
be
a
member
of
the
en
banc
court,
you
wouldn't
need
any
legislation.
now,
let
--
let
me
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it
--
it
doesn't
deal
specifically
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
with
the
problem
that
you
have
here
as
to
whether
an
active
circuit
judge
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
i
agree
with
you,
but
if
--
if
--
if
the
decision
below
in
this
case
is
right
that
any
judge
who
can
be
designated
and
assigned
under
43
(b)
may
also
--
may
also
be
a
member
of
the
en
banc
court.
and
it's
an
a
fortiori
conclusion
that
judge
hand
and
judge
medina
who
--
who
--
who
sits
in
a
--
the
hearing
--
mr.
philip
elman
all
right.
well,
he
certainly
maybe
--
he
can't
--
he
is
designated
and
assigned
when
he
--
when
he
--
when
as
an
active
judge,
he
is
a
member
of
the
en
banc
court.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
quite
true
but
the
rationale
of
his
--
of
--
of
--
of
the
decision
is
43
(b),
and
43
(b)
just
cannot
be
accepted
consistently
with
46
(c).
now,
i
think
the
point
may
perhaps
be
more
clearly
illustrated
by
comparing
what
was
done
in
this
case
with
another
case
in
which
judge
medina
participated
just
about
the
same
time.
that
was
the
reardon
against
california
tanker
case,
in
260
f.
2d,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief.
now
that
case
was
argued
november
8,
1957
before
judge
swan
who
is
retired,
judge
medina
and
judge
waterman.
medina
and
waterman,
judges
medina
and
waterman
were
still
in
active
service.
now
on
march
1,
1958,
judge
medina
retired.
the
case
was
decided
the
following
month
april
7,
1958,
opinion
by
judge
swan,
concurred
in
by
judge
waterman
with
judge
medina
dissenting.
now,
judge
medina's
participation
in
a
case
decided
by
a
three-judge
panel
after
his
retirement
raises
no
problem
at
all
under
46
(c).
46
(c)
has
nothing
to
do
with
three-judge
panel
decision.
and
there
were
some
30
odd
cases
in
which
judge
medina
had
sat
before
he
retired
in
which
he
participated
in
the
decision
after
his
retirement.
it's
not
an
uncommon
situation.
there
isn't
any
connection
with
judge
magruder
and
almost
every
retired
circuit
judge
and
the
uniform
practice
throughout
the
country
has
been
that
there's
no
reason
in
the
world,
why
a
circuit
judge
who
was
sat
in
the
case
where
a
three-judge
panel
can't
--
can't
proceed
to
with
what
the
decision
notwithstanding
his
retirement,
because
a
retired
judge
does
not
lose
the
power
to
participate
in
that
kind
of
action
of
the
court
of
appeals,
simply
by
reason
of
his
retirement.
it's
46
(c)
that
presents
the
problem
and
that's
limited
to
the
en
banc
courts.
now,
in
that
reardon
case
after
the
three-judge
panel
decision
in
which
judge
medina
participated
dissenting,
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
granted
and
the
--
the
--
the
order
recited
that
was
by
vote
of
the
majority
of
the
judges
of
the
circuit
in
active
service.
and
so
far
as
we
can
tell
from
the
reports,
every
time
the
second
circuit
grants
rehearing
en
banc,
it's
by
vote
of
the
majority
of
the
judges
in
active
service.
in
any
event,
in
that
case,
rehearing
was
granted
and
the
en
banc
court
convened
and
reversed
the
panel
decision,
judges
swan
and
medina
not
participating.
so
that
in
the
second
circuit,
as
in
every
circuit,
it
is
clear
that
where
a
--
where
an
en
banc
hearing
is
ordered
after
the
retirement,
the
retired
judges
don't
sit.
and
the
reason
why
they
don't
sit
is
section
46
(c)
which
has
been
construed
and
applied
since
1948
as
meaning
that
whatever
a
retired
judge
can
do,
retired
circuit
judge
can
do
after
his
retirement,
and
he
can
do
practically
everything
that
he
did
when
he
was
an
active
circuit
judge.
the
one
thing
he
can't
do
after
his
retirement
is
sit
as
a
member
of
the
en
banc
court.
anymore
that
when
the
justice
of
this
court
retires,
he
cannot
participate
in
the
actions,
in
decisions
of
this
court
even
as
to
cases
that
were
heard
and
--
before
him,
cases
in
which
he
participated
in
the
conference
discussions.
he
may
even
have
written
a
draft
opinion,
but
when
the
justice
of
this
court
retires,
he
is
through
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
he
maybe
assigned
to
the
circuit
judge
--
courts,
he
can
be
assigned
to
the
court
of
claims,
he
can
be
assigned
to
the
district
court,
but
he
cannot
be
assigned
to
this
court.
it's
a
disqualification
which
cannot
be
cured
by
a
designation
or
assignment
and
the
reason
is
that
there
is
no
statute
which
authorizes
a
retired
justice
of
this
court,
once
he
retires
to
participate
as
a
justice
in
any
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
philip
elman
statute.
mr.
philip
elman
the
statute
--
the
statute
says
--
mr.
philip
elman
statute,
i
think
statute
says
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
statute
--
the
statute
doesn't
make
it
necessary
to
look
at
the
reasons,
mr.
justice
black,
because
if
they
are
retired
--
mr.
philip
elman
oh,
i
think
they
are
very
--
very
real
parallels
between
the
--
the
retired
circuit
judge
who
sits
in
an
en
banc
proceeding
and
a
retired
justice
of
this
court,
because
an
en
banc
decision
is
--
is
so
far
as
it
lays,
it
--
it
--
it
becomes
an
authoritative
expression
of
the
law
in
that
circuit,
which
isn't
going
to
become
here
for
review
in
the
ordinary
courts.
that's
a
--
that's
a
final
decision
and
--
and
--
and
it's
just
--
it
would
be
just
as
inappropriate
for
--
for
a
retired
judge
to
participate
in
that
kind
of
a
thing,
in
that
kind
of
proceeding
as
retired
justice
of
this
court.
mr.
philip
elman
but
the
recommendation
is
a
very
narrow
one.
the
recommendation
is
limited
to
retired
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
who
have
sat
in
the
original
hearing.
there
are
various
--
various
specific
qualifications.
it
doesn't
mean
that
judge
leibell
could
sit
in
this
--
in
en
banc
proceeding.
it
doesn't
mean
that
judge
magruder
could
sit.
it
doesn't
mean
that
judge
hand
could
sit
unless
he
was
a
member
of
the
original
panel.
now,
that
there
are
--
the
judicial
conference
weigh
this
policy
considerations
and
has
come
forward
with
its
proposal.
it
was
introduced
by
congressman
celler
early
in
this
month.
no
hearings
have
been
held.
that's
where
the
question
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
of
policy
ought
to
be
considered
entirely.
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
place
to
decide
these
questions
of
policy
is
--
is
in
congress
upon
the
recommendations
of
all
agencies
concerned.
i
don't
think
in
this
court
we
should
have
to
decide
whether
it
would
be
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
to
read
this
statute
the
way
congress
wrote
it
in
1948,
even
though
there
might
be
some
policy
considerations,
which
we
don't
really
think
are
very
serious,
that
it
might
cut
the
other
way.
mr.
philip
elman
well
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
this
is
--
this
is
far
from
a
world-checking
problem.
i
think,
the
fact
that
this
is
the
first
case
since
1948
with
this
--
with
the
judges
of
the
courts
of
appeal
have
talked
about,
it
showed
that
it's
far
from
that.
in
the
fiscal
year
59,
there
were
3753
cases
decided
by
the
courts
of
appeals
throughout
the
country.
there
were
22
hearings
en
banc,
and
there
were
six
circuits
in
which
there
were
no
hearings
en
banc.
now
that
shows
the
order
of
magnitude
of
this
problem.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
now
what
we
--
now
the
argument
is
made
--
the
argument
is
made
that
if
you
apply
this
statute
the
ways
it's
written,
there
will
be
all
kinds
of
practical
problems
of
reconstituting
the
courts.
suppose
a
new
judge
--
new
circuit
judge
is
appointed,
does
that
mean
you
have
to
start
all
over
again?
why
--
of
course
not.
anymore
than
when
a
justice
is
appointed
to
this
court,
he
participates
in
--
in
cases
that
were
heard
and
considered
by
the
court
before
he
took
his
sit.
ordinarily,
the
rule
of
judicial
practice
is
that
a
new
judge,
if
he's
not
familiar
with
--
with
the
case
and
if
it's
gone
so
far
that
ought
to
be
decided
without
his
participation,
he
won't
participate,
but
of
course,
the
court
of
appeal,
just
like
this
court,
can
set
the
case
down
for
rehearing
depending
on
a
particular
circumstance.
and
we've
cited
cases
in
our
reply
brief
where
both
have
been
done.
mr.
philip
elman
who
can
say?
[laughter]
mr.
philip
elman
what
makes
this
case
a
very
dramatic
case,
of
course,
is
that
the
district
court
dismissed
these
libels
on
the
authority
of
two
second
court
--
circuit
decisions.
the
case
was
heard
before
a
three-judge
panel.
judge
hincks
wrote
the
opinion
and
he
said,
“well
we're
bound
by
these
two
second
circuit
decisions.”
they
are
very
recent
ones,
and
we're
--
we
don't
think
that
we
are
to
overrule
them
although
it
were
recent,
although
we're
not
sure
if
we
come
out
the
same
way.
now,
the
first
of
those
cases,
the
sword
line
case,
the
panel
consisted
of
judge
clark
and
judge
waterman
and
judge
hand
dissenting.
now
judge
clark
and
judge
waterman,
of
course,
adhered
to
their
views.
now,
then
came
up
before
these
three-judge
panel
with
judge
medina,
judge
hincks
and
--
and
--
and
judge
clark,
i
beg
you
pardon,
judge
leibell.
and
judge
--
this
--
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
traditional
classic
situation
of
a
problem
which
the
en
banc
proceeding
has
tend
to
avoid.
judge
--
judges
hincks
and
medina
felt
themselves
bound
to
follow
these
earlier
decisions
even
though
they
disagreed
with
them.
and
this
--
where
you
have
this
kind
of
an
intra
circuit
conflict,
the
statute
says
that
the
en
banc
court,
if
it's
ordered
by
majority
of
the
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit,
shall
consist
of
those
judges
and
nobody
else.
now,
if
--
if
46
(c)
means,
as
we
think
it
unquestionably
means,
that
a
judge
who
has
retired
before
the
hearing
en
banc
cannot
be
designated
to
sit
with
the
en
banc
court,
it's
because
the
statute
makes
him
incompetent.
he's
just
disqualified
to
sit
there,
just
as
if
he
had
resigned.
a
resigned
judge
can't
be
assigned
to
sit
with
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
and
a
retired
judge
is
in
precisely
the
same
position
as
--
as
a
resigning
judge
as
to
en
banc.
so,
that
if
judge
medina,
after
he
had
participated
in
the
hearing
en
banc,
had
decided
to
resign
on
his
70th
birthday.
he
--
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
he
heard
the
case
doesn't
mean
that
he
had
any
power
to
decide
it.
now,
the
respondents
argue
that
there's
a
general
principle
that
once
a
judge
hears
a
case,
he's
under
a
duty
to
decide
it.
well,
as
a
generalization
it's
certainly
valid
but
it
doesn't
carry
very
far
when
there's
a
specific
statutory
provision
that
says,
he
can't
decide
it
because
he's
incompetent
to
decide
it.
mr.
philip
elman
we
are
asking
your
honors
to
hold
that
when
this
case
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc,
judge
medina's
participation
in
that
decision
was
not
authorized
by
section
46
(c).
the
judgment
should
be
vacated
by
this
court
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
section
46
(c),
which
would
leave
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
power
and
the
responsible
discretion
to
decide
what
disposition
of
the
case
should
be
made
by
it
which
is
not
in
violation
of
the
statue.
all
we're
asking
your
honors
to
hold
is
to
apply
the
statute
here,
leaving
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
question
whether
the
court
on
remand
there
should
be
a
new
hearing
en
banc
before
the
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
of
the
--
as
--
as
they
now
consist
also
of
judge
friendly,
conceivably
judge
smith,
maybe
confirmed
by
the
time
the
case
gets
back.
mr.
philip
elman
certainly
not.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
appeals
might
decide
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
last
judgment
of
the
court
which
was
vacated
by
this
one
--
this
one
being
invalid,
the
court
of
appeals
might
decide
that
it
would
like
--
it
would
--
would
let
the
matter
rest
there.
we
don't
--
we're
not
telling
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
only
--
the
only
reason
the
case
is
here
is
that
we
--
we
think
that
it's
important
that
section
46
(c)
not
be
disregarded.
and
we
think
that
if
--
if
the
interpretation
given
to
that
--
to
43
(b)
by
judge
hincks
is
accepted
there's
practically
nothing
left
of
46
(c).
there
would
be
no
limit,
no
ceiling
as
--
as
to
this
--
as
to
the
composition
of
the
en
banc
court.
mr.
philip
elman
certainly.
that
was
referred
to
the
whole
court
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
which
is
--
mr.
philip
elman
we're
not
suggesting
it
should
be.
all
we're
suggesting
that
it
would
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
judgement
that
is
under
review
here
appears
in
the
record
at
page
136.
it's
the
judgement
of
july
28,
1958
which
with
--
withdrew
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
panel
in
order
that
the
judgment
of
that
three-judge
panel
be
vacated
and
that
a
new
judgement
be
entered.
we
are
asking
your
honors
to
vacate
that
judgment
now
because
of
judge
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
medina's
participation.
now
if
you
do
that
--
if
you
do
--
if
you
do
that,
you
leave
the
status
of
the
case
precisely
as
it
was
on
march
1st,
1958
when
judge
medina
retired.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
would
leave
the
order
granting
rehearing
en
banc.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
mr.
philip
elman
absolutely
nothing.
mr.
philip
elman
no.
nothing
wrong.
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
if
they
decided
to
vacate
it,
there
would
be
grounds
for
our
coming
back
here,
because
that
--
whether
--
whether
rehearing
en
banc
should
be
vacated
is
for
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
is
a
question
that's
not
before
the
court
right
now.
the
only
question
before
the
court
right
now
is
the
validity
of
this
judgment
of
july
28,
1958
and
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
point
of
that
with
this
problem
that
forced
it
down.
there
is
an
argument
here
which
is
presented
very
seriously
that
even
though
--
even
though
judge
medina
couldn't
sit,
even
though
the
statute
barred
him
from
sitting,
even
though
he
isn't
--
he
wasn't
the
jury
judge
when
he
voted
to
in
this
case,
still
he
was
a
de
facto
judge.
and
so
that
--
on
that
the
assumption
of
this
argument
is
that
even
if
section
46
(c)
specifically
said,
“the
court
en
banc
shall
consist
only
of
active
circuit
judge
of
the
circuit
and
a
retired
judge
cannot
vote
in
the
case,
even
though
he
was
an
active
circuit
judge
when
he
heard
the
argument
of
the
case
still
he
can't
sit.”
this
argument
would
be
that,
well,
if
he
did
sit,
it
was
de
facto
and
therefore
this
court
shouldn't
disturb
his
judgment.
now,
if
the
statute
means
--
means
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
then
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
philip
elman
well
i
--
i
must
--
i
must
direct
myself.
i've
given
you
an
impression
that
--
that
there
is
a
lacuna
in
the
statute.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
let
me
rephrase
--
let
me
rephrase
it.
there's
no
--
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
48
code
or
the
bill,
and
that
originally
enacted
1941
from
which
it
spread,
or
the
textile
mills
opinion
or
anything
else
that
relates
to
this
problem
which
shows
that
anybody
specifically
addressed
themselves
to
this
particular
precise
now
problem.
but
if
you
look
at
the
whole
picture,
you'll
find
throughout
in
the
textile
mills
opinion,
very
first
sentence
of
the
textile
mills
opinion,
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
composed
of
the
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
makes
it.
there's
been
--
there
is
no
reference
at
all
at
any
point
to
the
retired
judges.
the
assumption
throughout,
and
of
course,
this
is
negative
legislative
history
and
the
significance
that
it
has,
if
your
honors
to
decide,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
anybody
thought
that
at
anytime
the
retired
judge
could
sit
in
an
en
banc
court,
and
the
statute
specifically
says
that
only
active
circuit
judges
may
sit.
so,
we
don't
think
there's
any
lacuna
in
the
statute.
now,
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
the
circumstance
that
judge
medina
was
an
active
circuit
judge,
when
--
at
the
time
the
case
has
submitted
the
en
banc
court
was
concerned.
if
section
46
(c)
means
that
an
en
banc
court
which
hears
and
determines
the
case
may
consist
only
of
active
circuit
judges,
then
there
is
no
difference
as
we
see
it,
in
the
situation
where
he
retired
before
the
case
was
heard
by
the
en
banc
court
and
the
case
where
he
retires
after,
because
at
the
time
of
the
decision
of
the
case,
he
is
disqualified
from
participating
to
the
same
extent
as
if
he
had
resigned.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
there
is
a
difference
but
should
there
be
a
difference
in
the
result
if
--
if
--if
the
section
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
why
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
suppose
judge
--
suppose
--
this
a,
of
course,
fantastically
absurd
but
suppose
judge
medina
at
the
--
after
--
after
participating
properly
and
validly
in
the
hearing
before
the
en
banc
court,
suppose
he
had
been
impeached
and
suppose
he
had
sat,
suppose
some
--
some
--
someone
thought
that
didn't
make
any
difference.
now,
if
a
disqualification
attaches
to
judicial
power,
a
disqualification
which
cannot
be
remedied
by
designation
or
assignment
by
the
chief
judge
or
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states,
the
power
can't
be
exercised
wether
it's
resignation,
impeachment,
or
retirement.
and
--
and
so
far
as
an
en
banc
proceeding
is
concerned,
we
think
that
the
statute
means
that
they
--
there's
as
much
of
a
disqualification,
as
if
he
had
resigned
and
if
--
if
there
are
any
--
any
--
any
difficulties,
illogic
or
any
reasons
at
all
why
the
statute
should
be
change,
that's
for
congress.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice.
section
1
of
title
28,
united
states
code
provides
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
shall
consist
of
a
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
and
eight
associate
justices,
any
six
of
whom
shall
constitute
a
quorum.
that
language
exactly
parallels
46
(c),
“a
court
en
banc
shall
insist.”
if
46
(c)
is
to
be
interpreted
as
meaning
a
court
en
bank
shall
include,
but
shall
not
be
limited
to
all
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit,
it
would
be
very
difficult
not
to
read
section
1
of
title
28
as
meaning
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
shall
include,
but
not
be
limited
to
the
chief
justice
and
eight
associate
justices.
on
the
question
of
the
disqualification
of
retired
members
of
this
court
to
participate
in
cases
which
they
heard
before
retirement,
there's
no
provision
of
the
statute
which
says
that
they
may
not
do
so
but
there
is
a
provision
of
the
statute
which
provides
affirmatively
what
duties
--
what
judicial
duties
may
be
performed
by
members
of
this
court.
that's
section
294
(a)
of
the
code
which
provides
that
any
retired
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
or
associate
justice
of
the
supreme
court
may
be
designated
and
assigned
by
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
to
perform
such
judicial
duties
in
any
circuit
including
those
of
a
circuit
justice
as
he
is
willing
to
undertake
by
implication
since
the
statute
does
not
authorize
the
retired
justice
to
be
designated
and
assigned
to
sit
in
this
court,
he
may
not
do
so.
the
same
argument
we
submit,
same
line
of
statutory
construction
should
apply
to
section
46
(c).
we
do
not
think
that
this
court,
unless
it
gives
the
words
different
meanings
and
different
provisions
can
say
that
a
court
en
--
en
banc
shall
consist
of
--
of
active
circuit
judges
of
the
circuit
who
sit
when
the
case
is
heard.
mr.
justice
burton
as
i
recall
retired
at
a
time
when
there
were
cases
that
he
had
participated
in
it
remained
undecided.
now,
that
was
true
of
mr.
justice
minton
and
other
justices
who
--
who
retired
from
this
court.
you
cannot
say
and
it
has
never
been
suggested
by
anyone
so
far
as
we
know
that
because
he
was
--
the
retired
justice
was
a
member
of
the
supreme
court
consisting
of
a
chief
justice
and
eight
associate
justices
of
whom
he
was
one
and
therefore,
could
participate
in
the
decision
and
cast
a
vote
after
he
was
retired.
retired
judges
of
the
circuit
--
of
the
--
of
the
courts
of
appeals
maybe
assigned
judicial
duties
as
they
are
willing
to
undertake.
section
28
u.s.c.
294
says
that
any
retired
circuit
or
district
judge
may
be
designated
and
assigned
to
perform
such
judicial
duties
in
any
circuit
as
he
is
willing
to
undertake.
but
that
doesn't
permit
him
to
be
assigned
to
judicial
duties
in
any
circuit
that
the
statute
says
he
is
incompetent
to
undertake,
anymore
than
that
--
that
would
be
true
in
the
case
of
this
court.
in
respect
to
en
banc
proceedings,
a
retired
justice
--
a
retired
judge
is
no
different
from
a
resigned
judge.
now,
there
have
been
some
citations
given
to
your
honors.
we've
discussed
them
in
our
brief
and
i'll
--
and
i
--
i
think
perhaps
there's
been
an
indiscriminate
proof
of
those
cases
and
i
will
repeat.
there
is
no
case
in
which
any
judge,
retired
circuit
judge
has
sat
in
an
en
banc
proceeding
after
his
retirement,
no
case.
if
he
has
retired
before
the
en
banc
court
was
convened,
there
is
no
case
in
which
the
retired
judge
has
sat.
there
is
no
case
in
which
a
retired
judge
has
voted
to
grant
rehearing
en
banc.
there
is
a
different
problem
as
to
denying
rehearings
en
banc,
they
are
participating
in
the
deliberations.
there
is
no
case
in
any
circuit
in
which
a
retired
judge
or
an
assigned
judge
has
cast
an
effective
vote
to
grant
rehearing
en
banc.
there
is
the
related
problem
as
to
three-judge
courts,
the
problem
imposed
by
the
goldfine
case
numbered
36
--
396
pending
our
petition
for
certiorari.
as
i
said,
section
46
(c)
deals
only
with
en
banc
proceedings
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
three-judge
decisions.
the
only
question
--
the
only
possible
question
in
those
cases
is
whether
--
where
a
judge
has
retired
after
the
hearing
but
before
the
decision,
whether
it
is
necessary
that
there'd
be
an
additional
formal
written
designation
and
assignment.
there
isn't
a
question
of
his
competency
to
sit.
of
course
a
retired
circuit
judge
may
continue
to
sit
if
he
is
assigned.
the
only
question
is
the
--
the
formal
one
and
no
--
mr.
philip
elman
there's
a
difference
between
--
there
is
a
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
difference
between
the
question
of
power
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
which
cannot
be
cured
by
the
any
piece
of
paper
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
no
matter
by
who
signed
and
there's
the
question
of
what
kind
of
--
what
is
meant
by
the
word
designation
and
assignment?
mr.
philip
elman
i
withdraw
the
word
formal.
all
i
--
all
i'm
suggest
--
all
i'm
saying
is
that
as
to
three-judge
panel,
participation
by
a
retired
judge,
there
is
no
question
or
--
as
to
his
power,
his
right,
his
competency
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
qualification.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
requires
a
chief
judge
who
--
who
sits
alongside
judge
--
whether
chief
--
putting
it
concretely,
whether
chief
judge
woodbury
had
to
give
judge
magruder
sitting
in
the
very
same
case
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
and
a
piece
of
paper
saying
--
saying,
"i
hereby
assign
you
to
sit
in
this
case
which
--
in
which
you've
been
sitting
all
along
and
--
and
in
which
you
and
i
and
--
and
the
third
judge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
precisely
--
of
course
and
--
and
the
question
is
what
does
a
statute
command
in
a
three-judge
--
mr.
philip
elman
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
a
designation
shall
consist
of
a
piece
of
paper
and
to
sit
in
that
situation.
mr.
philip
elman
that
problem
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
i
mentioned
it
only
because
counsel
has
--
has
referred
to
that
situation
which
when
i
--
i
am
hoping
only
to
make
the
point
that
it's
distinguishable
and
raised
it
that
way.
mr.
philip
elman
only
to
distinguish
what
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
in
all
situations
except
en
banc
situations
that
it's
the
same.
the
only
question
is
one
of
the
designation
and
assignment.
as
to
en
banc,
we
repeat,
even
the
--
even
the
--
in
a
certified
designation
and
assignment
signed
by
all
of
the
members
of
this
court
and
the
--
and
the
judicial
conference
and
all
the
judicial
counsels
couldn't
possibly
give
judgment,
namely
the
right
to
participate
in
this
case
en
banc.
mr.
philip
elman
i
am
telling
you
that
this
is
the
only
case
in
which
this
problem
was
discussed.
it
is
the
only
case
in
which
counsel
has
objected
to
a
--
the
participation
by
the
retired
circuit
judge
in
the
decision.
there
are
--
there
are
cases
which
we
have
mentioned
which
reach
same
factual
situation,
was
presented
but
wasn't
referred
to/
there
are
the
two-third
circuit
cases
involving
judge
maris
as
the
price
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
involving
judge
healey,
nobody
mentioned
--
mr.
philip
elman
hertzog
--
hertzog
and
sawyer
in
the
ninth
circuit,
different
results,
nobody
discusses
it,
counsel
don't
--
doesn't
raise
it.
the
hertzog
came
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
and
wasn't
advanced.
the
curious
thing,
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
problem
seems
to
have
been
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
and
when
the
judge
--
when
judge
clark
in
his
dissenting
opinion
here
that
first
raised
the
problem
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
that
precise
problem
was
discussed
only
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
--
i
think
it's
important
that
the
question
be
settled
so
that
it
doesn't
become
a
widespread
practice.
if
it's
settled
right,
it's
unimportant.
if
it's
settled
wrong,
it
--
it
would
become
very
important.
