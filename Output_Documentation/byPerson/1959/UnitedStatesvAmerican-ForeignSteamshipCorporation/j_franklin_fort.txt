mr.
j.
franklin
fort
(inaudible)
mr.
becker
is
arguing.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
your
honors
please.
my
argument
will
have
to
be
cut
down
some
but
what
i
would
like
to
deal
with
primarily
is
the
question
of
what
is
the
practical
solution
to
this
problem.
in
both
the
textile
mills
case
and
the
western
pacific
case,
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
considerable
liberality
in
the
constitution
of
en
--
en
banc
courts
and
that
--
that
any
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
will
aid
in
the
smoother
administration
of
justice
should
be
adopted.
now,
we
think
that
taking
the
date
of
the
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
your
honor,
it
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
it
was
a
broad
statement
but
--
but
in
--
in
textile
mills,
it
was
stated
that
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
or
doubt
about
the
statute
that
the
interpretation
which
reaches
a
practical
result
is
the
interpretation.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
your
honor,
in
picking
the
date
on
which
the
en
banc
court
is
constituted,
we
think
that
there
will
result
certainty
insofar
as
the
judges
themselves
are
concerned
and
as
well
as
the
litigants
in
the
course
of
the
completion
of
the
case.
any
judge
who
becomes
a
member
of
the
en
banc
court
will
know
that
the
work
that
he
does
on
the
case
and
will
be
accepted
or
considered
that
whatever
--
whatever
his
views
are,
they
will
be
considered
by
the
other
judges
and
that
his
--
his
views
will
be
considered
in
the
final
decision
whether
it
be
as
a
part
of
the
dissent
or
a
part
of
the
majority.
the
rule
in
respect
to
district
judges
and
in
respect
to
panel
judges
clearly
is
that
they
shall
be
permitted
to
continue
with
the
consideration
of
any
case
which
is
given
to
them
to
decide
irrespective
of
whether
they
retire
or
not
and
that
they
can
finish
the
judicial
business
and
we
feel
that
this
rule
which
seems
to
be
of
universal
acceptance
should
be
accepted
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
en
banc
courts.
again,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
litigants,
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
if
the
court
must
be
reconstituted
every
time
there
is
a
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
group
of
judges
in
the
circuit,
then
questions
will
arise
concerning
re-argument,
resubmission
of
briefs
and
it
will
no
doubt
delay
the
completion
of
the
en
banc
consideration
of
the
case.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
accept
that
argument.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
a
judge
can
feasibly
accommodate
his
retirement
to
the
completion
of
a
case
which
is
uncertain
and
i
think
this
case
is
an
excellent
example
of
that
because
the
en
banc
consideration
began
in
december
1957
and
wasn't
completed
until
february
1959.
and
there
was
a
15-month
lag
there
during
which
--
presumably
on
the
government's
theory,
judge
medina
should
have
postponed
his
retirement.
in
addition
to
which
if
he
remains
an
active
judge
as
i
read
the
statutes,
he
would
have
to
take
a
full
case
load
until
the
en
banc
case
was
--
was
decided
and
it
would
clearly
interfere
and
impede
retirements
by
the
circuit
judges
which
are
encouraged.
now,
the
retirements
on
our
theory
would
permit
the
judge
to
retire,
to
participate
in
the
decision,
a
new
judge
to
be
appointed
who
in
turn
could
take
on
new
duties
in
the
court.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
that
there
are
two
main
reasons,
your
honor
that
this
court
has
mentioned.
one
is
to
decide
the
important
issues
and
the
other
is
to
resolve
inter-circuit
conflicts.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
intra-circuit
conflicts.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
you
honor,
no,
i
don't
--
well,
it
will
depend
upon
what
the
constitution
of
the
en
banc
court
was
but
on
the
government's
rule,
a
judge
can
be
dropped
only
but
cannot
be
added.
whereas
in
the
rule
that
we
have
vacating,
we
taking
the
date
on
which
the
court
has
convened,
you
will
have
a
--
a
court
which
presumably
can
take
the
case
to
a
final
decision
with
a
recourse
only
to
this
court
after
the
decision
is
rendered.
now,
we
have
--
in
the
second
circuit,
we
have
had
three
changes.during
the
course
of
these
en
banc
proceedings,
judge
medina
retired,
judge
hincks
has
retired
and
judge
friendly
has
been
appointed.
there
is
a
vacancy,
there
has
not
been
a
substitute
appointed
for
judge
hincks.
there
is
legislation
pending
which
might
result
in
two
new
justices
being
--
judges
being
appointed
to
that
circuit
and
if
the
case
is
remanded,
the
--
the
status
of
all
of
those
judges
perhaps
will
come
into
question.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
that
--
i
think
that
it
is
--
is
questionably,
your
honor,
although
it
--
as
i
say,
it
depends
upon
the
way
the
votes
of
the
judges
are
cast.
now,
here
we
had
a
five-judge
court
below
which
was
properly
convened
under
the
en
banc
statute
and
they
were
able
to
resolve
the
intra-circuit
conflict.
on
the
government's
rule,
judge
medina
would
have
been
ineligible
to
sit
on
the
decision
and
the
conflict
would
not
have
been
resolved.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
that
our
rule
is
full
proof
but
we
think
that
it
is
--
creates
much
more
certainty
and
will
avoid
delays
in
the
functioning
of
the
en
banc
court.
