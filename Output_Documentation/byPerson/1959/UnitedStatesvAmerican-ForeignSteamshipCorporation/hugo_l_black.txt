justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
reasons
that
have
been
advanced
for
drawing
that
distinction
between
the
circuit
judge,
sitting
after
he
retired
in
trial
and
not
sitting
in
an
en
banc?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
reason
to
accept
the
statute,
i
may
ask?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
--
i
am
familiar
with
the
statute,
i
am
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
talking
about
the
practical
reasons
suggested
for
one
side
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
there
are
--
then
they
are
none
that
you
can
take
up
on
either
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
--
your
chief
argument
is
really
on
the
textile
mills
statement,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
of
course
that
wouldn't
be
true
if
the
statute
said
otherwise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
is
the
main
reason
for
having
en
banc
theory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
inside
the
circuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that
is
one
of
the
reasons,
does
that
cut
against
your
argument
in
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i'm
asking
for
was,
if
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
should
think
probably
or
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
the
points
decided
by
the
judges
who
are
to
remain
there
after
that
time
would
come
nearer,
stabilizing
the
law
so
far
as
the
intra-circuit
situation
is
concerned.
