justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
as
to
the
15%
of
the
industry
that
is
not
struck,
does
the
record
show
anything
as
to
the
likelihood
one
way
or
the
other
that
there
would
be
--
the
strike
spreading
to
those
--
that
15%
within
a
foreseeable
period
of
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
still
the
22nd?
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
at
this
point,
is
it
the
fairest
thing
to
say
that
in
this
course
of
events
that
you've
given,
there
was
no
objection
by
either
side
to
the
time
on
the
stay?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
means
health
of
individuals
rather
than
the
health
of
the
nation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
national
health
is
simply
a
short
formed
way
of
saying
national
well-being,
national
welfare.
justice
john
m.
harlan
general,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
your
argument
on
safety
that
you
accept
the
premise
that
safety
refers
to
the
military
safety?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we've
been
talking
hear
all
about
defense,
your
arguments
entirely
predicated
on
defense
and
i
wonder
if
i
understood
you
correctly
that
that
was
the
premise
in
which
you
regarded
the
reach
of
the
word
“safety”.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
limit
the
content
of
the
statutes
to
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
misunderstood
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
perhaps
the
question
is
consistent
to
you
in
your
position
(inaudible)--
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
100%
plants
were
struck,
so
that
no
steel
companies
were
operating,
would
your
position
here
be
different
from
that
it
--
what
it
is
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
national
health
aspect
of
the
statute,
would
your
position
be
different?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
suit
brought
for
the
respect
to
only
that
one
plant
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
or
other
three
plants?
justice
john
m.
harlan
only
the
one.
