justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
president
could
not
make
a
finding
in
this
matter
as
distinguished
from
the
opinions
and
the
question
anyway
with
the
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
goldberg,
if
i
may
call
you.
do
you
contend
that
national
safety
means
individual
safety?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
national
health
does
mean
individual
as
distinguished
from
national.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
condition,
as
i
understand
you
right,
does
not
affect
the
national
health,
the
national
health?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
--
would
that
involve
the
exercise
of
a
discretion
to
deny
an
injunction
or
merely
to
differ
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
not
in
steel?
