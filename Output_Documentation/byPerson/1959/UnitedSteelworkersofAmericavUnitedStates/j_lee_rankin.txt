mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
saying
that
the
government
accepts
the
statement
by
counsel
of
the
chronology
of
events
in
this
case
and
comments
that
it
is
very
frank,
open,
and
skillfully
done.
this
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
the
country,
to
the
union,
to
management,
and
of
course
to
our
judicial
system
in
this
country.
i
should
like
to
clarify
the
governmental
position
in
regard
to
the
taft-hartley
act
to
start
with.
it
is
not
the
position
of
the
government
that
congress
had
any
intention
to
open
up
norris-laguardia,
wipe
out
that
statute,
and
permit
injunctions
in
the
same
manner
as
had
occurred
prior
to
that
time
in
labor
disputes.
we
think
if
some
of
the
arguments
of
the
union
were
valid
especially
about
whether
this
injunction
would
contribute
to
the
settlement
of
the
dispute.
if
that
was
the
measure,
the
congress
certainly
should
have
made
the
statute
broad
enough
to
encompass
all
labor
disputes,
because
that
is
the
objective
that
we
are
all
looking
for
in
all
of
that.
we
think
that
there
has
been
a
gloss
imposed
upon
the
area
of
labor
disputes
in
this
country
that
must
be
recognized
by
all
parties
and
by
the
courts.
the
wagner
act
and
the
labor
management
act
are
all
part
of
that,
so
that
you
cannot
expect
or
think
about
returning
to
a
condition
prior
to
norris-laguardia.
but
the
labor
management
act
did
have
a
purpose.
and
it
was
conceived
by
a
congress
that
was
bedeviled
by
strike
and
labor
disputes
during
the
year
1946
that
were
unequalled
in
the
history
of
this
country
except
for
the
year
1919
right
after
the
first
world
war.
and
we
must
address
ourselves
in
a
consideration
of
this
statute
and
what
its
meaning
is
and
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
for
the
country,
not
for
management
or
labor
either
one
of
them,
but
for
all
the
people
of
this
country
in
this
act,
in
the
light
of
the
situation
that
existed
then.
there
were
more
men
out
of
work
than
any
other
period
during
that
year
in
the
history
of
the
country
up
to
that
date,
and
more
work
stoppages.
that
is
not
entirely
true
as
to
work
stoppages
when
you
compare
the
labor
force.
if
you
compare
the
labor
force
back
in
1919,
it
was
larger
proportionately,
the
work
stoppages.
but
the
actual
number
were
larger
in
1946
than
anytime
in
the
history
of
the
country.
what
happened
during
1946?
you
recall
that
the
end
of
hostilities
was
declared
in
december
of
that
year.
and
the
congress
had
to
consider
the
effect
upon
all
of
the
legislation
that
bore
on
the
question
of
hostilities
and
whether
or
not
it
was
effective
with
our
hostilities
continuing.
but
they
had
strikes
and
labor
disputes
and
very
difficult
ones
to
look
at
in
determining
what
action
should
be
--
they
should
try
to
take
in
solving
these
problems.
there
was
a
strike
in
the
automobile
industry.
there
was
a
nationwide
steel
strike
that
year.
there
was
a
strike
of
the
bituminous
coal
mines.
and
the
government
seized
those
coal
mines.
there
was
a
railroad
strike
and
the
government
seized
the
carriers.
and
then
there
was
a
strike
after
the
seizure
of
the
carriers.
the
president
addressed
the
joint
session
of
the
congress
asking
that
he'd
be
given
some
emergency
legislation
to
help
solve
this
situation.
i
don't
mean
any
implication
that
this
was
his
solution
because
you
recall
he
vetoed
this
particular
act,
but
he
did
ask
for
some
affirmative
help
from
the
congress
in
the
form
of
emergency
legislation
to
help
solve
this
problem.
great
lake
shipping
was
tied
up
by
a
strike.
the
unlicensed
maritime
personnel
went
on
strike
and
paralyzed
shipments
in
every
port
in
the
country.
and
the
licensed
personnel,
as
soon
as
the
unlicensed
came
back
to
work,
the
licensed
went
off
and
held
up
shipping.
the
bituminous
coal
industry
was
struck
again
after
the
government
took
it
over.
then
you
recall
the
celebrated
contempt
action
involving
mr.
john
l.
lewis
and
his
union
and
the
large
judgment
of
damages,
all
of
that
occurred
during
this
year.
and
there
were
great
variety
of
additional
strikes
during
that
year,
too
numerous
to
name.
now
it's
against
that
background
that
we
have
to
consider
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
do
when
it
passed
the
statute.
in
the
first
place
it
was
very
careful.
no
one
could
read
the
history,
let
alone
the
statute
itself,
without
observing
that
congress
was
using
great
care
not
to
open
up
the
injunctive
procedure
generally
in
regard
to
labor
disputes.
it
was
only
in
very
limited
area
that
they
were
going
to
permit
it.
and
you
had
to
find
that
the
strike
or
lock-out,
it
applies
to
both,
affected
either
a
substantial
part,
the
two
key
elements,
or
the
entire
industry.
and
then
you
have
to
find
that
the
nation's
health
and
safety
is
imperilled.
only
in
those
events,
not
nation's
health
or
safety,
only
in
those
events
can
you
get
an
injunction
under
this
act.
now
i
say
that
the
congress
was
using
great
care
as
was
evidenced
throughout.
the
history
shows
that
the
bill
in
the
house
was
not
accepted
by
the
congress.
it
had
a
distinction
which
cuts
several
ways.
now
one
of
the
distinctions
was
that
the
bill
has
finally
passed,
that
was
developed
in
the
senate
largely
under
the
direction
of
senator
taft,
was
to
encompass
a
much
larger
area
of
commerce.
i
think
the
bill
in
the
house
could
be
said
to
have
been
covering
very
much
communications,
public
utilities
and
special
groups
of
national
industries
of
that
type.
but
the
bill
in
the
senate
was
to
--
provided
that
it
would
include
businesses
which
were
engaged
in
commerce
or
affected
commerce.
on
the
light
of
the
history
of
all
that
had
happened
up
to
1946
from
the
1930
on,
it
can
hardly
be
assumed
that
the
congress
didn't
know
when
it
was
changing
language
that
way,
that
it
could
not
appreciate
the
difference
of
the
enlargement
that
it
was
providing
in
this
change
in
the
legislation.
now
we
do
not
say
that
in
construing
section
208
which
is
the
key
section
of
the
statute,
that
you
turn
to
section
1
(b),
the
purpose
that
congress
recites,
and
that
you
try
to
read
from
that
something
into
section
208
that
isn't
there.
all
we're
trying
to
do,
which
we
think
is
common
and
legitimate
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
is
to
look
upon
the
purpose,
as
we
cited
there,
which
this
court
has
said
in
a
preamble
of
an
act,
cannot
affect
or
change
the
operative
sections
of
the
legislation.
for
some
guide,
that
might
help
us,
if
you
have
difficulty
interpreting
section
208
from
the
language
itself.
then
we
have
some
difficulty
with
section
1
(b).
it
set
--
set
out
at
the
bottom
of
page
38
of
our
brief.
and
there,
the
congress
that
did
carefully
reject
the
words
or
interest
or
it
says
in
this
provision
jeopardize
the
public
health
safety
or
interest.
in
the
final
operative
sections,
the
congress
has
very
carefully
--
careful
not
to
accept
that
terminology
of
public
safety,
public
health
safety
or
interest
as
the
measure,
but
it
left
in,
in
this
section
of
the
same
act
this
provision.
now
the
way
we
understand
that,
and
the
government,
is
that
the
congress
in
the
operative
words
was
trying
to
make
clear
that
the
national
health
and
safety
or
safety
was
what
governed,
but
that
as
between
these
two
expressions,
they
did
not
carry
it
over
into
this
section.
and
if
you
assume
that
the
congress
was
intending
to
carry
it
over
and
this
therefore
should
read
the
national
safety
or
health.
nevertheless,
it
does
furnish
guidance
to
anyone
examining
the
statute
as
to
what
congress
was
trying
to
say
in
this
act
and
its
passage.
and
there
you
will
note
that
the
congress
expresses
what
it
thinks
about
people's
rights
in
this
area.
it
is
trying
to
make
very
plain
that
it
does
respect,
and
it's
obvious
from
the
debates
that
it
did,
the
right
to
strike.
that
is
a
part
of
the
american
system.
we
regard
it
as
a
--
an
important
and
precious
right
of
our
people.
and
the
right
of
lock-out
is
also
a
right
of
management
that
the
congress
respected
as
a
part
of
our
free
system.
but
after
they
recognized
that
carefully
and
thoroughly,
they
then
say,
“nobody
has
a
right
to
do
this
to
the
american
people
if
it's
going
to
imperil.”
so
they
say,
above
all,
neither
party,
that's
management
and
labor
or
either
one,
has
any
right
in
its
relations
with
any
other
to
engage
in
acts
or
practices
which
jeopardize
the
public
health,
safety
or
interest.
now
if
they
really
meant
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
proper
reading
of
it
in
view
of
what
they
did
about
national
safety
and
health,
or
health
in
the
other
part,
i
think
it
properly
should
read
as
the
change
they
made
otherwise
as
to
the
national
health
or
safety.
but
either
way
you
read
it,
it's
a
very
strong
expression
by
the
congress
that
no
one
has
a
right
to
jeopardize
the
people
generally,
their
rights
by
their
acts.
now
they
don't
say
all
other
rights
or
the
general
welfare
anything
like
that.
we
have
to
restrict
it
more
than
that.
but
they
do
say
the
national
health
or
safety.
now
it's
quite
impossible
for
me
on
behalf
of
the
government
to
understand
how
national
safety
can
be
recognized
as
the
safety
of
a
nation,
and
then
you're
going
to
take
that
word
national
and
when
you
apply
it
to
health
you
mean
something
else.
how
congress
could
have
any
such
conception
and
how
our
reasonable
minds
can
arrive
at
such
a
conclusion
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
conceive
because
it's
just
one
phrase,
it's
the
same
--
it's
tied
together
right
there
and
if
you're
going
to
deal
with
health,
as
you
would
safety
as
involving
the
whole
nation
and
its
safety,
that
certainly,
it
seems
to
me,
would
have
to
do
the
same
with
regard
to
health.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
that
that
is
a
restrictive
application
that
the
government
is
not
willing
to
go
along
with
--
if
the
--
because
it
seems
that
if
you're
going
to
do
that
you
have
to
assume
that
it
means
biological
health
or
the
health
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
of
the
individuals
as
distinguished
from
the
nation.
now
the
nation
has
a
health
too
just
like
it
has
a
question
of
safety,
and
the
difficulty
they
have
with
saying
that
the
safety
of
the
nation
does
not
involve
the
defense
of
the
nation
is
that
they
can't
find
any
other
application
that
could
be
reasonably
pointed
to.
and
that's
true,
but
the
--
the
health
of
the
nation
or
the
national
health,
the
government
contend
is
much
more
than
the
health
of
the
individuals.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now
if
it
was
public
interest,
the
government
would
concede
that
that
is
even
larger
concept
than
public
health,
than
the
national
health.
and
that
it
involves
other
elements
that
might
not
be
involved
in
economic
well-being
or
even
imperiling
the
economic
life
or
development
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
that
you
--
if
you
took
the
general
interest
of
the
country,
you'd
have
almost
any
factor
that
there
could
be
that
could
be
adversely
affected,
it
could
affect
the
country
adversely.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that--
that
is
a
factor.
it
also
generally
affects
the
health
of
the
country
in
its
ability
to
conduct
its
various
activities
domestically
and
otherwise
and
it
also
often
depending
upon
how
long
it
continues,
affects
the
health
of
the
people
generally
and
sometimes
far
beyond
the
people
that
are
involved
in
the
strike
itself.
now
we
think
that
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
in
the
legislative
history
from
the
language
itself
that
would
limit
it
to
such
a
narrow
concept.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
steel
strike
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
is
quite
effect
during
steel
too.
now
i
think
that
the
difference
might
be
shown
by
a
strike
in
the
automobile
industry
which
would
be
more
remote
as
far
as
having
a
direct
effect
upon
the
whole
economy
and
the
ability
of
the
country
to
national
health
or
to
maintain
itself.
it
takes
longer
for
a
strike
in
the
automobile
industry
and
it's
secondary
in
its
effect
upon
the
ability
of
people
to
maintain
themselves
and
the
country
to
maintain
itself
and
so
forth.
even
though
you
have
the
same
number
of
workers
but
in
the
steel
industry,
that's
a
basic
commodity
which
--
the
production
of
which
is
equal
to
all
other
metals
in
this
country.
and
when
you
shut
that
down,
there
are
many
industries
which
are
well
able
to
continue
except
for
that
particular
product.
there's
no
strike
in
that
particular
industry
and
there's
disposition
on
the
part
of
both
management
and
labor
to
go
ahead
and
do
business,
but
they
just
can't
because
they
don't
have
the
commodity.
now
that
is
another
factor
that
was
very
serious,
of
course,
this
youngstown
case
that
the
court
is
well
familiar
with
and
other
occasions
during
our
history
and
the
effect
upon
the
conduct
of
the
nation's
business.
and
it's
--
it's
the
activity
of
its
labor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh
no.
it
very
definitely
had
in
mind
a
--
the
national
safety
would
be
--
involve
the
ability
of
the
country
to
conduct
its
defense
and
be
able
to
satisfy
its
commitments
to
its
allies
and
its
various
international
associations
that
it
had
throughout
the
world
and
(inaudible)
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh
yes.
the
congress
had
clearly
conceived,
as
we
read
it,
that
if
either
one
was
satisfied
that
was
enough
for
the
injunction
and
we
think
it's
clear
under
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
defense
of
the
country
is
imperiled.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
more
difficult
one.
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
government
did
not
conceive
the
limited
position
that
was
contended
for
by
counsel.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
generally,
the
congress
uses
the
words
public
health
when
it
applies
to
the
area
of
the
biological
health
of
the
people
of
the
country.
but
i
don't
think
that
you
can
rely
on
that
completely
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
started
out
with
the
word
public
health,
safety
or
interest
and
then
changed
over
to
national.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know
of
any
other
but
i
haven't
made
that
kind
of
a
search.
i
made
a
brief
search
through
the
indexes
generally
and
found
they
usually
treated
it
under
public
health
when
they're
dealing
with
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
just
was
trying
to
clarify
that
it
started
out
that
way
in
the
house
and
carries
over
into
the
preamble.
now
if
you
make
the
most
extreme
argument
on
behalf
of
the
government,
you'd
say,
well
there
is
the
congress
still
kept
it,
but
i
think
their
intention
really
was
to
make
it
national
health
and
--
or
safety
like
they
did
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
right.
but
i
think
that
we
have
to
turn
to
section
208
for
our
real
force.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
but
this
was,
we
think,
applied
to
jeopardizing
this
particular
area
and
that
that
was
the
emergency
area
that
they
were
considering
when
they
spoke
about
the
right
to
jeopardize.
now
there's
the
reliance
by
the
union
considerably
upon
statements
of
congressmen,
then
congressman,
kennedy
in
the
house,
now
senator
in
regard
to
the
kind
of
strike
that
he
was
trying
to
give
refernce
and
provide
for
and
his
statement
was,
“some
method
must
be
worked
out
to
deal
with
strikes
which
crippled
the
nation's
industrial
power”,
and
that
is
not
quoted
by
counsel
but
we
think
that
that
shows
his
appreciation
of
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with.
he
even
went
farther
than
this
act
and
that
he
thought
that
the
injunction
should
be
permanent
in
form
and
so
recommended
in
his
minority
report.
but
he
did
think
where
they
were
of
national
strikes
that
that's
what
should
be
reached
and
he
was
trying
to
reach
in
this
legislation
even
though
he
presented
the
minority
report.
now
in
regard
to
the
evidence
in
this
case,
it
was
tried,
as
counsel
said
on
affidavits
and
that
is
a
different
form
than
we
often
have,
but
it
was
by
agreement
of
parties
limited
to
that,
and
so
i
don't
see
how
that
contributes
much,
except
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
lower
courts
did
comment
properly
upon
that
evidence
when
they
said
that
these
people
who
were
giving
the
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
government
were
charged
with
important
responsibilities
in
the
areas
in
which
they
purport
to
speak.
and
each
of
them,
the
secretary
of
commerce,
when
he
was
talking
about
this,
had
the
responsibility
not
only
of
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
state
of
the
nation's
economy
and
--
and
its
business
activity
and
all
of
those
things,
but
the
department
of
commerce
has
also
the
defense
allocations
division
and
it
is
a
part
of
its
responsibilities
to
try
to
find
out
and
determine
when
the
defense
requirements
of
the
country
are
being
met
and
if
they
are
not
being
met,
how
that
can
be
done
by
allocations.
now
some
of
the
arguments
presented
by
counsel
here,
we
do
not
think
were
properly
presented
or
even
developed
at
all
before
the
lower
courts.
and
this
question
of
abuse
of
discretion,
we
do
not
find
at
any
place
as
in
the
manner
counsel
is
now
presenting
it.
if
you
note
the
request
for
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
--
but
it
does,
mr.
justice
black,
deal
with
my
problem
of
trying
to
meet
it
here
adequately
for
you.
that's
all
that
i
want
to
call
it
to
your
attention
for.
i
think
this
matter
of
great
importance
and
this
court
should
have
all
that
we
can
contribute
toward
it.
but
when
the
question
is
raised
here
for
the
first
time,
it
does
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
marshall
all
of
the
facts
that
i
would
otherwise
have
for
you,
and
i
tried
to
do
it,
and
i'll
--
i'll
call
attention
to
them
later.
but
on
page
215,
in
the
finding
that
was
requested
by
counsel
for
the
union,
you'll
notice
that
he
did
not
say,
did
not
ask
the
court
to
find
that
it
had
discretion
to
deny
the
injunction
if
it
found
that
there
were
some
plants
that
could
be
opened.
in
that
course,
they
took
the
position
that
the
only
way
that
any
plants
could
be
opened
would
be
just
to
produce
defense
materials
and
we
met
that
squarely
by
showing
how
impossible
and
impractical
it
was
to
try
to
do
anything
like
that.
you
can't
open
the
steel
mill
and
run
out
a
little
batch
of
this
and
then
close
down
and
start
up
another
batch
and
run
out
another
little
batch
of
that
and
they
recognize
that.
they
didn't
meet
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
--
dr.
(inaudible)
affidavit,
and
showed
that
how
it
just
was
an
impossible
thing
to
do.
now
they
come
up
with
the
idea,
well
we
--
you
don't
have
to
limit
them
that
way,
you
can
open
them
up
for
all
purposes
and
run
them
just
for
civilian
purposes,
or
defense.
now
that's
entirely
a
different
problem
and
i've
tried
to
seek
out
in
the
government
in
response
to
the
people
in
regard
to
the
allocation
of
materials
and
knowledge
in
this
field
but
it
could
be
done
in
there.
and
i'll
develop
that
for
you
too
but
i
want
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
--
this
question
was
not
developed
in
the
way
counsel
suggests
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
there
was
--
maybe
it's
in
11,
the
suggestion
that
they
should
take
defense
into
consideration
alone.
my
argument
all
the
way
through
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
regard
was
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
issue
injunction
at
all
if
they
could
open
few
plants
for
defense
purposes
only,
rather
than
that
the
court
had
that
discretion.
now
this
is
a
change
of
approach,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
conclusion
on
page
215
and
number
2
is
any
fair
request
to
a
court
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
determine
that
steel
plants
could
opened
for
defense
purposes
alone
or
for
defense
purposes
and
civilian
purposes
too
when
they
tie
up
as
they
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
difficulty
with
that
assertion
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
it
--
it
was
in
some
cases
but
not
as
to
particular
plants.
now,
but
the
proof
was
there
that
as
to
certain
top
priority
and
crucial
programs,
the
steel
wasn't
available
from
any
of
the
plants
that
were
open,
and
that
it
was
impracticable
and
uneconomic
and
unreasonable.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
the
latter.
the
detail
of
the
effect
on
each
of
the
particular
defense
projects
was
given
by
the
deputy
manager
of
the
--
the
manager
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
each
of
ones
that
had
charge
--
the
space
agency
and
the
acting
secretary
of
defense
telling
in
detail
just
various
things
that
were
necessary
and
what
programs
affected?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
as
there
wasn't
any
question
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
secretary
gates
and
in
--
in
the
manager
--
general
manager
of
the
atomic
energy
and
head
of
the
defense
--
deputy
head
of
the
defense
of
the
space
agency.
each
one
going
in
with
particularity
to
the
fact
that
the
mercury
program,
the
manned
satellite
and
the
bigger
program
of
the
special
large
satellite
and
the
polarus
submarines
and
the
--
the
various
control
devices
and
much
of
the
research
program
and
the
fact
that
some
of
the
satellite
--
of
the
missile
program
was
all
--
they
couldn't
get
the
supplies
they
needed
and
they
had
to
close
down
and
was
already
closed
down
in
several
places
and
that
four
more
would
be
closed
down
in
very
short
time.
that
is
explicitly
stated
and
that
it
wasn't
available
from
many
other
source.
then
the
suggestion
was
made
and
that
was
all
that
it'd
be
made,
provided
from
some
of
the
plants
that
were
struck,
that
limited
to
defense
alone
and
that
was
meant
by
dr.
(inaudible)
affidavit
that
this
just
couldn't
be
done.
now,
in
this
court
for
the
first
time,
we
are
met
with
claim,
well
open
them
up
for
all
purposes
the
struck
mills.
it
couldn't
be
done
from
the
others.
now,
it's
been
suggested
by
counsel
that
the
government
had
no
program
of
allocation
under
the
defense
production
act
that
was
in
effect
during
this
period
and
that
they
were
johnny-come-latelies
about
applying
it
on
october
16th.
that
is
not
true.
the
fact
is
that
the
defense
allocations
administration
have
been
in
cooperation
with
the
defense
department.
anyone
who's
worked
with
the
military
procurement
knows
it's
a
complicated
operation.
there
are
certain
steel
mills
that
are
qualified.
and
all
the
mills
know
how
to
become
qualified
for
producing
steel
that
will
satisfy
the
defense
contracts.
and
the
government
over
long
experience
has
tried
to
set
up
that
system
because
they
have
found
that
steel
is
often
times
not
in
accordance
with
the
requirements.
we
have
much
case
history
about
the
fact
that
during
some
of
our
military
operations,
the
steel
was
not
what
it
was
supposed
to
and
we've
had
difficulties
because
of
that.
if
they
don't
require
a
some
kind
of
a
standard
about
the
steel
that
goes
into
it
and
qualify
suppliers
on
that
kind
of
a
basis,
then
the
manufacturers
that
use
that
have
difficulty
with
the
quality
of
it
and
their
product
is
rejected
and
they
say,
“well,
why
don't
you
either
qualify
them
or
why
didn't
you
do
this
and
why
do
you
cause
us
all
of
these
expenses
and
so
forth.”
so
anybody
could
find
out.
it's
part
of
the
public
record
that
they
have
qualified
suppliers
for
these
various
activities
and
have
had
them
under
regulations
under
the
allocations
administration,
under
the
defense
production
act.
and
those
were,
in
effect,
at
all
times
up
to
the
very
moment
of
this
action
in
the
district
court
and
their
efforts.
now
what
happens?
they
have
a
certificate
that's
put
upon
the
invoice
by
authority
of
the
defense
department
and
the
allocations
administration.
and
that
says
to
the
supplier
of
steel,
anybody
they
want
to
go
to
is
a
qualified
supplier
that
this
particular
defense
manufacturer
for
the
government
is
qualified
as
with
certain
priority
and
is
entitled
to
get
the
steel.
now
that
system
was
working
on
everyone
of
the
open
plants
in
the
country,
and
the
defense
allocations
administration
had
known
not
a
single
time
that
there
was
any
indication
from
the
defense
department
upon
inquiry
daily
between
the
two,
that
any
of
the
items
that
the
--
the
defense
department
needs
and
threaten
the
security
of
this
country
could
be
obtained
from
the
plants
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
from
a
single
one.
that
was
not
being
taken
care
of
by
that
system.
now
the
--
they
were
supplying
some
defense
materials
but
there
was
this
part
that
is
not
supplied
that
can't
be
taken
care
of.
some
of
it
they
were
just
not
able
to
do
at
all
because
of
special
kinds
of
steels,
some
of
it
--
and
in
quantities
they
were
not
able
to
do,
some
of
them
are
not
--
apparently
not
either
able,
ready
or
willing
to
do.
and
so
there
is
some
that
they
are
furnishing
in
regard
to
defense
contract
of
this
position
to
the
government
that
you
can't
take
out
the
defense
needs
of
the
country
and
say,
“this
part
will
do
without“
or
in
such
litigation
as
this
have
the
union
say,
“well
you
don't
really
need
any
shells
today,
you
just
forget
about
that”
or
“you
don't
need
any
rifles
or
some
other
kinds
of
units.”
the
defense
operation
has
to
got
to
be
one
that
is
followed
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
the
congress
in
procurement
and
in
trying
to
establish
a
balanced
defense
program.
now
someone
could
determine
that
--
we
don't
need
to
have
to
replace
our
planes
for
sac
as
greatly
as
we
did
before
we
had
missiles.
and
on
the
other
hand
someone,
the
president
or
the
commander-in-chief,
has
got
to
decide,
well,
we
better
well
maintain
the
sac
until
we've
got
the
missiles
in
such
shape
that
we're
sure
they'll
take
their
place.
and
so
it's
under
that
whole
complex
of
defense
need
that
we
try
to
present
the
facts
to
the
court
as
--
as
to
the
safety
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that's
less
than.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
can't
say
that
latter
because
i
want
to
explain
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
the
--
a
system
was
in
effect
so
that
these
invoices
were
provided
and
the
invoices
were
presented
and
did
not
get
the
commodity.
now
there
is
the
assumption
that
the
manufacturer
who
is
producing
defense
materials
would
try
to
get
the
materials
from
one
of
these
suppliers
in
order
to
keep
his
plant
open
and
still
operate,
but
we
think
that
was
a
fair
assumption
that
the
government
could
make.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
true
as
to
well
these
particular
materials.
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
answer
a
question
for
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
was
trying
to
describe
a
little
bit
of
the
problem
in
regard
to
trying
to
furnish
to
you
on
whether
or
not
plans
that
are
not
struck
could
furnish
it.
i
think
one
of
the
difficulties
in
regard
to
the
affidavits
in
this
case
is
that
the
union's
affidavits
very
largely
treat
steel
as
though
it
was
a
fungible
commodity.
it
is
of
course
when
you
deal
with
the
ingots
but
when
you
get
beyond
that,
you
have
so
many
and
very
great
problems.
there
are
so
many
shapes
and
forms
and
sizes,
thousands
of
them.
and
then
you've
also
get
into
qualities
of
various
kinds
of
stainless
cobalt
and
alloys,
some
35
different
alloys
that
to
try
to
assume
that
just
because
a
supplier
either
a
plant
--
steel
plant
as
they
call
it
or
a
warehouse
had
any
such
material
that
you
needed
for
defense
contract
just
because
they
had
a
thousand
tons
of
items
that
were
steel
is
an
impossible
assumption.
when
the
contractors
are
seeking
a
particular
commodity,
they
need
something
that
will
fit
the
design
but
they're
given
by
the
defense
department
and
it
isn't
the
right
shape
or
form,
if
that's
the
problem
of
course,
it's
of
no
value.
one
of
the
problems
we
have
now,
with
a
large
inventory
which
is
not
bound
completely
it's
around
seven
million
tons
from
about
almost
25
that
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
strike
and
it's
going
down
at
some
five
million
a
month,
it's
the
figure
that
is
given.
even
with
that,
there
are
many
items
that
contractors
are
unable
to
find
that
will
fit
with
the
things
that
they
have
in
supply.
and
it's
of
course
useless
to
try
to
have
just
a
half
a
car
or
a
railroad
wheel
when
you
need
axle
to
go
with
it
or
other
parts
of
the
steel
product
that
you're
trying
to
develop.
so
that
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
in
examining
this
question.
now,
there
are
also
are
steel
suppliers
who
are
qualified
by
the
defense
department.
and
anybody
that
wants
to
come
forward
and
qualify
for
these
various
--
the
supply
steel
is
very
welcome.
and
they
have
had
all
kinds
of
procedure
in
regards
to
that.
and
they
so
certify
it
when
they
are
qualified.
now,
many
of
these
cases,
some
steel
plant
will
come
forward
and
say,
“we'd
like
to
qualify.”
and
it
maybe
as
much
as
six
--
as
six
or
eight
months
before
they
demonstrate
their
ability
to
produce
the
quality
of
steel
that
the
defense
department
contract
requires.
so
that
--
that
is
one
of
the
problems.
it
was
some
of
the
mills
that
are
not
struck
at
the
present
time.
another
problem
is
that
many
of
those
mills
have
got
all
the
business
and
that
they
can
handle
in
the
form
of
defense
contracts
they're
now
supplying
their
ability
to
take
care
of
defense
contracts.
the
--
and
then
there
--
the
special
items
that
i
referred
to
in
regard
to
missile
and
the
other
top
priority
programs
that
none
of
the
mills
that
are
struck
can
supply.
so,
in
dealing
with
that
problem,
i
just
wanted
to
demonstrate
the
fact
that
there
was
in
effect,
in
accordance
with
public
regulations,
a
system
that
was
taking
out
of
the
unstruck
mills
everything
that
would
contribute
to
the
defense
effort
without
any
further
order
on
october
16th.
now,
on
october
16th
at
least
say
in
our
brief
a
counsel
referred
to.
we
did,
the
government
did
through
the
allocation
administration
put
out
this
order
to
take
care
of
the
mills
if
a
settlement
was
reached
or
if
the
injunction
or
when
the
injunction
became
effective
to
terminate
the
strike.
at
that
time,
there
would
be
a
considerable
problem
in
the
whole
industry
of
the
plants
that
had
been
struck.
the
problem
would
be
whether
hardly
it
would
deal
with
this
top
priority
items
that
had
accumulated
during
the
time
of
the
strike.
and
the
order
expressly
provides
that
they
shall
have
a
little
leeway
to
try
to
meet
these
requirements
for
defense.
instead
of
having
to
--
prepare
a
batch
for
a
particular
defense
item
and
if
they
have
another
item
that's
top
priority
too,
then
they
close
down
the
whole
works
instead
of
finishing
that
batch
out
and
make
the
next
one
which
would
become
so
economic
--
uneconomic,
that
the
government
would
have
to
pay
tremendous
prices
for
steel
that
--
within
a
very
limited
time
in
the
ordinary
course
of
doing
business
could
be
produced
at
reasonable
prices.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that
figure
is
accurate
but
it
isn't
--
i
don't
believe
much
more
than
2%
with
--
according
with
the
government
affidavits.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
our
,figure
we're
trying
to
define
the
actual
demands,
that
is
for
defense
contract.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
there
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there
is
a
factor
of
replacement
of
plant
and
all
of
those
elements
that
is
not
in
that
figure,
as
i
understand
it.
that
as
each
defense
contractor
has
to
put
in
new
machine
tools
from
time
to
time,
replace
his
rolling
--
his
rollers
and
another
things
in
the
plants
and
that
requires
steel.
and
that
is
not
enough
to
figure
but
that
would
not
be
a
large
sum.
now,
the
reason
that
the
figure
is
not
as
large
as
a
--
was
before
is
because
of
the
change
in
the
whole
defense
program
that's
involved
in
the
change
from
world
war
ii
to
our
present
plant.
while
it's
--
it's
a
very
substantial
amount,
it's
more
crucial
in
special
items
than
ever
before.
one
example
is
in
regard
to
missile
program,
the
skin
for
the
missile
is
of
the
special
stainless
steel
to
resist
the
conditions
of
the
atmosphere.
and
that
has
to
be
rolled
out
by
some
of
the
leading
mills
between
two
sheets
of
other
steel
in
order
to
make
this
steel
skin
otherwise
it
wouldn't
hold
together
during
the
rolling
process.
that's
part
of
the
problem
and
then
the
whole
research
and
development
program
is
also
involved
in
all
kinds
of
special
new
items
that
our
--
our
industry
is
adopting
as
rapidly
as
it
can
but
only
a
few
had
been
able
to
qualified
to
do
it.
and
it's
--
you
just
can't
accept
inferior
product
in
the
process.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
regulations
are
open.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
and
any
supplier
that
wants
to
come
and
qualify
is
free
to
do
it.
and
every
--
we
assume
--
that
is
allocation
assumes
that
any
manufacturers,
the
things
any
possible
supplier
that
still
not
struck
has
got
a
piece
of
steel
that
he
can
get
to
keep
his
place
open,
he
will
do
it.
and
that's
the
theory
back
of
the
allocations
and
that
the
system
that
was
working
part
of
the
october
16th
date
would
pick
up
any
steel
if
there
was
that
could
possibly
supply
these
contracts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
defense
department
tells
it
very
promptly
if
any
supplier
that's
qualified
is
willing
--
has
any
capacity
or
willing
to
do
any
business,
they
put
that
out
immediately
to
anybody
that
indicates
a
need.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
or
who
is
seeking
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
--
the
knowledge
is
what
--
to
whom
by
the
government
itself
to
the
contractors
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
if
there's
any
capacity
that's
--
the
government
knows
of,
that's
open.
they
notify
them
immediately
so
that
they
can
try
to
supply
the
government
contract.
that's
the
system,
and
that
was
in
operation.
the
problem
about
their
information
not
available
is
how
many
contracts
we
have
outstanding
in
the
ghost
amount
and
the
shapes
and
sizes
and
so
that
anybody
could
put
together
exactly
what
the
detail
of
our
defense
program
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you'll
add
to
that,
that
isn't
being
used
for
--
the
needs
that
are
outstanding
that
aren't
supplied.
they're
--
that's
true.
now,
some
of
our
supplying
needs
and
we're
not
figuring
that
in
the
amount
that
puts
us
in
jeopardy
or
in
parallel
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
the
detail
of
that,
as
i
said,
was
not
in
the
record
because
this
particular
issue
was
never
brought
out.
it
was
that
--
you
open
uneconomic
defense
plants
and
so
forth.
but
i
did
make
the
inquires
so
i
could
tell
the
court
what
the
fact
or
situation
was.
and
it
would
require
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
needs.
now,
some
--
you
will
take
seven
plants
for
general
means
that
would
have
to
be
open
with
some
75,000
employees.
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
would
be
or
included
within
that,
would
be
the
special
needs
for
special
steels
with
alloys
and
so
forth.
then
if
you
take
into
consideration
the
containers
that
they
recognized
would
be
and
referred
to
as
involving
health,
that
is
all
kinds
of
food
containers
which
is
in
very
short
supplied
the
present
time
and
would
or
badly
needed
to
meet
the
crop
needs
right
after
the
first
of
the
year
and
so
forth.
and
under
the
system
in
the
industry,
they
build
up
an
inventory
to
take
care
of
the
times
when
they
are
packing
and
so
forth
and
to
be
able
to
have
a
big
supply
on
hand.
to
take
care
of
that,
would
involve
another
about
160,000
employees
in
mill.
and
then
you
had
two
that
the
cindering
and
the
quarrying
employees
and
the
oil
producing
employees
that
are
integrated
in
this
--
these
operations
and
so
forth,
you
got
another
60,000
employees.
so,
i
was
advised
by
the
commerce
department
the
allocation
to
study
this
thing
all
the
time.
that
it
would
take
that
many
of
the
steel
plants
plus
the
--
the
seven
--
the
seven
that
i
referred
to,
to
take
care
of
just
defense
needs
plus
nine
additional
to
take
care
of
these
containers
that
they
recognized
as
a
matter
of
public
health
or
practically
around
to
have
of
the
entire
force
that's
out
just
to
take
care
of
those
two
problems
in
the
industry.
and
they
carefully
assessed
that
in
order
to
try
to
advise
what
the
situation
is.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
--
we
say
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
feel
that
if
that
is
found
to
be
imperil
that
it
clearly
satisfies
the
remote
--
most
remote
requirements
in
the
statute,
that
we
think
that
the
statute
require
--
provides
that
for
other
elements
has
to
safety.
but
that
if
you
find
the
defense
of
the
country
is
imperil
that
safety
means
at
least
the
very
least.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
we
think
that
other
elements
of
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
other
elements
in
the
economy
because
we
think
that
we
have
a
definite
problem
of
replacement
involved
in
safety
in
our
entire
transportation
system.
for
instance,
they
--
i'm
advised
that
some
60%
of
our
transportation
system
has
to
be
replaced
almost
regularly
that
60%
of
the
steel
that's
used
in
transportation
equipment
so
forth
is
for
replacement
purposes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
60%
of
the
amount.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
each
year,
60%
of
the
amount
that's
used
is
for
the
purpose
of
replacement
of
present
equipment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
of
the
amount
of
steel
that
used
in
--
in
making
transportation
equipment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
a
showing
in
regard
as
i
described
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
--
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
government
does
not
take
the
position
that
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
has
to
be
automatic.
but
it
does
take
the
position
that
if
the
national
health
or
safety
is
found
to
be
imperil
that
the
--
the
injunction
should
be
issued
unless
there
was
something
that
would
so
appeal
to
the
equity
or
judgement
of
the
court
that'd
be
overwhelming
against
that
strong
refinement
because,
by
its
very
nature,
as
defined
by
the
congress,
the
imperilling
would
have
to
be
something
that
is
recognized
to
do
great
damage
to
the
country
by
definition.
and
any
other
factors
that
could
be
considered
would
be
--
they
are
hard
to
imagine
even
that
could
overcome
a
finding
of
that
type.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
haven't
been
able
to.
i
was
trying
to
in
my
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
difficulty
we
have
with
that,
mr.
justice,
is
that
we
don't
like
to
say
that
an
equity
court
has
no
discretion
by
definition.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
equity
could
sit
in
equity.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
--
i
didn't
approach
it
that
way.
i
thought
that
the
--
the
government
that
--
in
an
equity
court,
it
was
traditionally
set
in
federal
system
in
determining
the
equities
in
regard
to
the
parties
and
that
here
they
would
have
to
in
trying
to
do
that
would
have
to
take
into
account
what
the
congress
had
said.
and
when
the
congress
dealt
with
anything
as
important
as
imperilling
the
health
and
safety
of
the
country,
it
would
have
to
be
something
remarkable
that
we're
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
--
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
isn't
anything
like
that
in
the
legislative
history.
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
because
we
don't
come
to
anything
like
the
broad
discretion
that
he
tries
to
claim
for
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
was
--
i
have
a
case
that
may
have
straight
what
i
was
thinking
that
i
developed
in
the
office.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[laughs]
well,
that's
--
that's
involved
but
the
case
i
was
thinking
of
in
the
or
described
in
the
office
was
where
it
was
indicated
to
the
court
that
although
all
the
proof
was
clear
that
the
national
health
and
safety
was
imperil.
at
the
moment,
both
parties
agreed
that
if
they
were
given
until
tomorrow,
they
would
settle
the
strike.
and
i
didn't
think
that
a
court
of
equity
even
--
in
light
of
the
statute
would
issue
the
injunction
or
that
this
court
would
find
it
was
error
if
it
failed
to
in
that
circumstance.
that's
the
best
i
can
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
probably.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
colleagues
didn't
think
it
was
a
very
good
example.
[laughter]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
haven't
designed
one,
i'll
confess.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
haven't
been
able
to,
i
confess.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
the
government
counsel
--
well,
i'm
--
i
just
wouldn't
want
to
try
to
supply
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[laughs]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
don't
like
to
disassociate
myself
in
prior
administrations.
i
think
they're
continuous
as
far
as
the
government
is
concern.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
would
have
to
satisfy
itself
as
to
the
peril.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
considerable
involved
in
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
imperiling
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
to
the
national
and
safety
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
foreign.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
i
meant
in
answering
you're
question
about
imperiling
that
i
thought
that
there
were
gradations
of
effect
on
the
various
elements
that
you
mention.
and
that
the
court
could
find
that
there
was
not
an
imperiling
if
there
is
certain
gradations,
even
though
he
would
be
satisfied
that
there
was
an
effect.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
my
own
thinking,
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
a
general
strike
in
the
automobile
industry
and
in
the
steel
industry
because
the
automobile
industry
is
one
in
which
they're
--
they're
producing
certain
equipment
but
steel
is
used
for
the
production
of
that
equipment
along
with
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
a
--
merely
of
other
items.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i've
said
that
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
in
order
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
statute
but
the
government
take
the
position
that
it
is
broader
than
the
union
claims
as
far
as
it
terms
but
you
can
use
the
narrowest
error
here
of
section
208
as
a
basis
and
we
think
we
have
satisfied
that
both
as
to
the
proof
and
the
findings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
only
as
to
containers
if
you
use
that
kind
of
a
definition.
there
is
a
real
threat
to
the
country
as
far
as
food
containers
are
concern
within
the
immediate
future.
and
that
is
within
that
kind
of
a
category.
now,
we
think
the
congress
deliberately
rejected
that
kind
of
an
approach
to
the
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
what
i
meant,
mr.
justice
black,
in
regard
to
that
was
that
the
congress
in
the
house
bill
did
have
those
--
that
type
of
units
as
those
that
could
be
enjoined
once
that
you're
describing
the
--
they
took
instead
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
argue
that
in
the
brief
in
detail.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
they
had
communications
and
public
utilities
in
language
of
that
type
in
place
of
industries
as
they
have
now
in
the
act
that
affect
commerce
or
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
engage.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seem
quite
apparent
but
they
try
to
make
it
broader
and
cover
industries
that
engaged
in
commerce
or
affect
commerce
which
is
the
widest
categories
that
you
can
imagine.
and
they
took
as
far
as
protecting
interstate
commerce
concern.
and
in
the
house
bill,
they
had
these
more
limited
standards
of
the
public
utilities
and
communications
and
so
forth.
now,
i
don't
move
--
before
we
leave
this,
i
--
maybe
you're
not
ready
to
leave
it,
i
don't
mean
that
--
i
would
say
that
automobile
strike
couldn't
imperil
the
national
health
and
safety.
but
i
think
the
time
when
it
would
imperil
might
be
far
different
than
it
would
be
as
to
steel
or
copper
or
some
other
commodity
that
was
involved
in
many
businesses
in
trying
to
produce
and
develop
for
the
country.
and
what
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
--
we
construe
that
the
--
that
congress
deliberately
chose
to
make
at
the
national
health
and
safety
which
are
quite
different
than
as
we
construe
it
in
the
public
health
and
safety
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
union
contends
otherwise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
--
didn't
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
contribute.
now,
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
talking
in
regard
to
the
--
or
interest
that
might
be
too
indefinite
words
to
that
affect
but
as
far
as
how
they
happen
to
--
to
decide
to
use
national
in
place
of
public,
when
they
used
to
modify
health
and
safety
or
health
or
safety,
i
--
i
didn't
find
anything
to
explain
that.
we
contribute
anything
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
didn't
seem
to
me,
mr.
justice
black.
now,
we
have
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
constitutional
problem.
and
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
serious
matter
in
this
case.
the
injunctive
power
is
one
that's
come
to
courts.
we
do
not
tie
the
injunctive
provision
of
a
lay
counsel
has
to
the
other
actions
in
the
statute
because
we
think
that
the
congress
deliberately
chose
the
injunction
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
protect
the
public
during
this
80-day
interim.
they
chose
the
80
days
or
a
period
of,
as
defined
in
the
statute
in
order
--
they
call
it
possible
cooling
off
period.
they
didn't
--
they
hope
for
settlement
during
that
period.
they
didn't
indicate
that
it
was
going
to
be
accomplished.
and
they
discuss
the
fact
that
whether
or
not
there
should
be
compulsory
arbitration
or
some
other
device
at
the
end
to
that
period
to
solve
the
strike
and
senator
taft
advised
directly
that
he
was
opposed
to
that,
that
he
felt
the
congress
should
examine
the
thing
upon
the
report
of
the
president
in
each
case
much
as
the
common
law
and
determine
what
should
be
done
to
solve
the
situation
at
the
end
of
the
injunctive
period,
if
--
if
the
strike
was
not
settled.
and
--
so,
it
was
not
conceived
that
this
would
settle
all
the
strikes
and
senator
taft
was
very
careful
to
point
that
out.
but
he
did
feel
when
--
that
the
congress
could
handle
the
matter
and
devise
a
program
for
each
incident
as
occurred
from
time
to
time
upon
the
report
of
the
president.
now,
the
elements
of
--
for
judicial
action
are
here.
the
issue
is
to
whether
or
not
the
country
is
in
peril
by
a
strike
that
satisfies
these
requirements
of
the
statute.
it's
a
factual
situation
that
the
courts
do
deal
with
in
some
areas.
we
think
it's
comparable
to
that.
the
courts
regularly
are
asked
to
deal
with
in
regard
to
the
anti-trust
laws,
in
regard
--
determining
whether
is
a
tendency
toward
a
trend,
toward
monopoly
or
whether
there's
the
other
elements
of
economic
and
financial
control
involved
in
some
of
those
case.
and
that
there
has
to
be
a
determination
as
--
not
only
as
to
the
present
condition
but
what
the
effect
may
--
might
be
or
will
be
in
the
future.
and
that
the
courts
have
traditionally
been
called
upon
to
do
that
and
congress
thought
it
was
asking
the
court
to
do
something
that
courts
do
traditionally
and
have
that
the
form
is
one
that
the
courts
have
been
called
upon,
to
act
upon
in
the
past.
the
tubin
(ph)
case
is
one
example.
we
think
that
the
power
of
the
government
to
acquire
property
under
statute
and
the
authority
congress
has
given
there
is
another
where
there
is
no
duty.
there
is
certainly
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
owner
of
the
property,
invade
the
property
before
the
action
is
brought
in
condemnation
proceedings
and
--
and
the
other
case
that
we
have
indicated.
we
think
the
debs
case
is
another
support
for
this
traditional
way
of
handling
procedures
in
the
courts.
and
that
it
supports
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
constitutional
argument.
i'd
like
to
say
final
that
i
think
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
develop
a
remedy
in
this
situation
that
would
protect
the
public
interest
that
they
were
not
trying
to
put
their
hands
upon
the
scale
and
health
either
labor
or
management.
that
it
--
the
construction
suggested
by
counsel
would
cause
it
to
have
a
very
inequitable
arrangement
if
there
could
be
some
of
these
plants
opened
and
others
remain
closed
because,
presumably,
either
those
that
were
close
and
were
unable
to
satisfy
their
civilian
business
would
lose
that
business
or
they
would
have
to
settle
immediately
and
pay
a
higher
price
to
the
business
in
the
interim.
and
if
you
follow
the
--
that
through
the
--
in
the
practical
economics
of
business,
you'd
see
that
congress
didn't
have
anything
like
that
in
mind,
it
didn't
intend
to.
it
was
trying
to
address
itself
to
the
protection
of
the
public
in
this
kind
of
situation
and
see
that
throughout
the
period
they
define
which
they
hope
would
make
it
possible
to
resolve
the
conflict
but
they
recognized
that
at
the
end,
it
will
have
to
be
accorded
to
the
congress
and
that
if
it
wasn't
determined,
the
congress
would
have
to
settle
it
in
each
case
for
itself.
