may
i
--
may
i
say
to
you
that
because
of
the
cooperation
which
the
counsels
of
both
parties
has
been
shown
throughout
the
proceedings
and
travelled
through
the
lower
courts
to
this
court,
we
feel
that
there
would
be
no
need
of
putting

limits

did
you
file
the

chief

to
what
issue?
chief

would
you
mind
--

you
mind
stating

chief

earl
warren
gentlemen,
i
think
it
would
not
be
out
of
order
at
this
--
at
this
time
to
--
to
say
that
in
these
days,
when
we
have
a
national
problem
of
court
congestion
and
delays
of
the
law,
it
is
both
refreshing
and
comforting
to
--
to
see
a
case
of
this
magnitude
tried
on
--
fully
tried
on
all
levels
of
the
federal
system
and
solely
through
the
cooperation
of
counsel
with
the
courts
and
with
each
other.
we'll
adjourn
now.
