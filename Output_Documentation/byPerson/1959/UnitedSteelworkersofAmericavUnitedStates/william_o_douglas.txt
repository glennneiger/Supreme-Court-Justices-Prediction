justice

douglas
health
of
the
citizenry
not
--
not
the
general
welfare
of
this.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
if
that
is
so,
you're
going
to
restrict
the
rule,
the
national
health
might
be
involved
in
such
thing
says
the
steel
has
served
in
processing
of
food,
steel
has
served
for
the
processing
of
milk,
it
is
necessary
for
the
production
of
surgical
instruments
in
hospitals.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
doesn't
quite
answer
you.
what
you
said
doesn't
quite
answer
the
petitioner,
i
don't
believe.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
does
mean
physical
well-being.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
of
course
you're
up
against
this,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
the
history
of
this
law,
you
had
a
--
some
contraction
of
the
standard
by
the
time
they
started
the
house
and
ended
in
the
congress
from
health,
safety
and
public
interest
to
health
and
safety.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
imagine
anything
that
would
be
broader
than
economic
well-being.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
way
that
strikes
affect
that
it
seems
to
me
to
be
generally
in
the
context
of
economic
well-being.
justice
william
o.
douglas
health
and
safety
and
things
like
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
maybe
not
but
i
was
wondering
if
--
as
--
as
i
read
the
legislative
history
yesterday
in
preparation
for
this
argument
whether,
what
you
said
in
the
beginning
wasn't
the
--
the
real
true
setting
for
this
whole
legislation,
namely,
the
united
mine
workers
case
and
the
coal
strike
and
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
the
imminence
of
the
shutdown
of
the
supplies
of
fuel
are
certainly
tremendously
important
to
the
health,
to
the
health
of
people
because
it
worked
with
the
houses
and
your
hospitals
and
the
schools
and
so
on.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
in
the
preamble
of
this
very
act,
there's
public
health,
safety,
or
interest,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
suppose
we
should
read
the
officials
of
both
(inaudible)
particularized
finding
of
that.
i
see
on
the
paragraph
11
on
page
214
of
the
petitioner's
brief
as
to
what's
the
reason
for
national
defense
which
(inaudible)
that
particular
situation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
was
your
answer?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
bane,
did
you
--
did
you
have
a
brief?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
going
to
--
do
you
plan
to
file
one?
