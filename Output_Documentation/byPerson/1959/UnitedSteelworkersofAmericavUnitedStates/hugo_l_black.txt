but
now
you
think
it
would
be
insufficient
to
support
for
a
finding
under
the
health?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
they
--
they
decided
on
the
basis
of
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
limitations
on
those
--
except
in
your
means
in
those
two
words?
what
part
the
limitation
for
the
issuance
of
an
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
you
are
right
on
the
meaning
of
the
health
as
including
not
merely
physical
health
but
economic
disruption,
if
you
are
right
with
reference
to
safety
as
including
not
merely
national
defense
but
economic
disruption
and
various
kinds,
what
other
limitations
in
this
field
which
the
court
would
have
to
refer
in
connection
with
issuing
an
injunction?

peril.
justice
hugo
l.
black
peril
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
peril
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
national
health
and
safety
means
health
of
the
people
like
the
milk
side
or
food
side
or
something
of
that
kind,
it
also
means
to
all
economic
disruption
which
had
made.
and
the
national
safety
needs
national
defense
and
also
all
economic
disruptions
we
might
have
been.
what
would
be
the
limitations
on
and
what
would
the
court
have
to
sign?
what
would
be
the
maximum
that
he
had
to
sign
in
order
to
--
if
he
doesn't
make
(inaudible)
in
order
to
get
injunction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
illustration
with
the
reference
to
the
automobile
industry,
the
economic
disruption
is
sufficient.
i
see
no
reason
for
drawing
the
slightest
distinction
between
the
fact
in
the
automobile
field
just
like
any
other
field.
it
doesn't
--
if
you're
not
--
not
limited
to
some
kind
of
health
under
national
defense
merely
economic
eruption,
why
wouldn't
the
public
be
heard,
why
wouldn't
it
be
terrible
for
the
national
health
that
you're
speaking
of,
you
don't
use
an
understatement.
to
have
a
general
strike
of
automobile
though
(inaudible)
stop
the
production
and
distribution
of
automobiles.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
it
have
to
close
up
the
steel
mill
though
as
it
bring
about
equality
in
distress
such
as
we
had
in
the
--
in
the
depression.
as
i
gather,
if
you
are
saying
is
something
like
this,
can
bring
on
something
like
depression
i
don't
mean
to
speak
(inaudible)
that
would
affect
the
national
health.
do
you
have
to
go
that
far
here
or
--
or
your
finding
--
are
you
going
--
is
it
necessary
to
construe
this
act
that's
being
left
that
far
in
order
to
support
your
case
from
your
standpoint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
satisfy
it
if
you
considered
that
national
health
means
something
that
would
see
imperil
the
national
physical
health
that
we
come
to,
like
a
national
milk
strike
for
or
national
food
strike
for
or
national
transportation
strike
that
were
stopping
food
from
being
distributed
or
national
electrical
strike
that
was
stopping
data
from
getting
a
milk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
--
is
it
--
is
it
your
judgment
that
the
--
your
case
is
sufficient
on
the
basis
of
that
meaning
with
reference
to
national
health?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
administered.
i
haven't
heard
even
one.
you
referred
to
anytime
when
the
intention
of
congress
would
focus
on
what
they
meant
by
national
health
is
an
argument
that
senator
kennedy
statement
that
an
indirect
equivalent
to
that
but
i
heard
neither
one
of
you
referred
to
any
direct
efforts
to
--
to
think
--
to
define
what
was
meant
by
the
national
health.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
did
have
that?
is
that
in
your
briefs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
had
something
about
the
national
health?
justice
hugo
l.
black
referring
to
it
as
health?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
that
taken
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
utility?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
--
i
haven't
heard
you
referred
to
it
yet,
i
--
either
one
of
you
(inaudible)
does
the
record
show
outside
of
what
the
statement
by
congressman
kennedy,
why
they
limited
the
--
the
public
health
and
safety?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
to
that
of
health
concerns?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
did
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
those
two
fields
or
what
does
the
record
show
about
why
they
chose
to
do
that,
the
--
the
report
or
anything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
you
says
interlied
on
whether
it
was
broadened
or
to
narrow?
