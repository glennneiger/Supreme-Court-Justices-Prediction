justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
last
year
85
million
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
figures
for
this
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
an
earlier
figure
that
you
gave,
probably
a
100
million
tons
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
there's
an
increase
for
the
technological
reforms
or
in
movements
thereby
--
more
is
produced
with
the
same
process
thereby?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
considerable
percentage?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
a
considerable
percentage?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
85
million
--
this
85
million,
out
of
the
85
million
attributable
to
advance
in
technology
and
plant
extension.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
two
--
those
two
have
added
and
gives
to
a
higher
company
despite
the
strike
period
--
strike's
period
if
you
will
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
his
first
paragraph,
he
says,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
in
feeling
with
the
forecast
to
imperil,
look
to
the
future
must
end
up
in
giving
enhancement
of
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
it
is
an
opinion,
that
it
isn't
upon
you
to
make
the
forecast.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
findings,
but
it
is
in
a
fashion
in
the
sense
of
something
that
can
be
objective
and
deserved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
one
knows
--
and
i'm
not
referring
to
this
case.
i
don't
suppose
one
knows,
or
does
one
know
as
to
what
the
practice
of
the
third
circuit
is
as
to
the
time
within
which
the
nonparticipating
judges
have
for
considering
the
opinion
or
opinions
of
the
panel,
does
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
wanted
to
know
is
just
--
and
that's
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
one
knows
they've
had
--
how
long
they've
had
the
opinion
before
they
decide
whether
or
not
they'll
vote
for
a
rehearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
one
has
--
one
has
to
know
then
when
the
opinion
of
the
panel
was
written
or
the
opinion,
wouldn't
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
to
answer
my
question,
would
one
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
purely
academic
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
offered
evidence
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
same
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you.
do
you
deny
that
that's,
whatever
your
phrase
was,
minute
or
a
small
percentage,
that
the
shutdown
of
that
imperiled
the
safety?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
it
comes
within
the
--
that
it
justified
the
injunction
but
as
a
determination
or
the
basis
for
the
president's
opinion.
do
you
deny
there
was
any
peril
to
the
national
safety
in
the
shutdown
of
any
branch
of
this
industry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
didn't
mean
--
didn't
mean
health
paralysis,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that
when
mr.
justice
brandeis
cited
it
in
the
unanimous
opinion
not
so
long
ago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
it
was
best
in
use
by
this
court
when
mr.
justice
brandeis,
who
knew
something
about
labor
and
we're
not
unfriendly
to
it,
in
the
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
a
different
story
but
it's
of
the
case
to
discredit
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
said
something
myself
on
that
subject
but
the
case
hasn't
been
discredited.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
government
--
well,
you
mark
(inaudible)
does
the
government
say
it
can
travel
outside
of
the
authorization
of
the
taft-hartley
act
to
sustain
its
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
questioning
your
view
and
their
view
of
the
act,
but
does
the
government
claims
to
sustain
this
--
desire
to
sustain
its
injunction
on
the
debs
ground
in
defense
of
the
--
that
did
not
rest
on
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
made
thereon
their
construction
of
national
health.
aren't
they
confined
within
the
structure
of
the
statute,
which
is,
the
injunction
certainly
couldn't
rest
beyond
the
time
that
it's
been
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
true
of
the
debs
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i'm
asking
again
whether
we're
to
understand
from
you
that
you're
answering
an
argument
that
i
wished
the
government
could
speak
to
sustain
its
injunction
outside
their
notion
of
what
the
statute
permitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
statute
i
mean
sections
206
and
210.
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
it
occur
with
reference
to
that
tiny
fraction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
here
it
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
all
depends
on
the
relation
of
the
5000
to
the
500,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say,
are
being
made
or
are
capable
of
being
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
do
we
know
in
what
amount?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
had
it
within
your
power
to
have
human
(inaudible),
and
you
agreed
to
leave
it
all
to
affidavits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
care
why,
but
that
is
a
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
all
i'm
saying
at
this
point
is
that
all
of
these
amounts
that
could
have
been
brought
out
through
the
--
i
would
say,
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
matter
of
information,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
by
which
we
can
tell
what
defense
orders,
if
that's
the
correct
term
to
use,
what
defense
orders
are
actually
in
place
at
those
non-struck
plants
or
what
percent
of
the
orders
placed
by
the
government
elsewhere
are
dependent
upon
steel
from
those
non-struck
plants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
had
you
desired
to
secure
this
information
through
the
power
of
compulsory
testimony
would
not
have
been
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
--
telling
me
at
least
what
specialty
steel
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
comprehend
your
argument
to
be,
and
you
can
correct
me
if
i
misunderstand
you.
do
i
comprehend
your
argument
from
the
last
few
minutes
to
be
that
since
there
are
three
available
modes
by
which
the
president,
even
though
he's
convinced
or
it
is
his
opinion,
the
national
safety
is
imperiled,
didn't
he
has
these
three
statutory
means
of
effectuating
and
overcoming
that
peril,
that
those
are
considerations
that
debar
the
use
of
the
--
of
the
taft-hartley
provisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
do
they
bear
on
the
discretion
of
the
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
pre-propositions
of
those
assurances
is
that
there
is
a
national
--
an
element
of
national
safety
which
may
concern
the
president.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
he
has
no
business
to
issue
the
injunction,
it's
none
of
his
concern
or
there
are
--
there
are
other
methods.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
a
good
baseline,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
suggest
that
falls
on
expression
of
an
opinion
and
not
a
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
fact
that
you
would
have
known
what
a
particular
judge
would
in
a
new
case
have
done,
if
you
had
asked
of
the
fact
that
be
tried
before
the
temporary
injunction
is
granted.
you
think
that's
a
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
the
point
though
about
granting
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
have
to
examine
all
the
details
of
all
those
other
cases
in
order
to
waive
the
property
that
just
led
you
to
agree
to
stipulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
well
know,
i
am
no
friend
of
affidavits
and
granting
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
suggested
that
all
counsel
are
optimistic
about
what
relief
they
can
get
within
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
congress
stand
on
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
remind
that
in
hecht
against
bowles,
the
statute
said,
they
issue
an
injunction
or
other
order,
in
this
case
it
said
and
other
order
--
and
other
appropriate
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
in
specifically
the
statute
since
i'm
happily
--
happily
find
you
resorting
the
statute
instead
of
the
history
if
you
know
what
the
statute
means
it
said,
issue
an
injunction
or
other
orders.
the
opinion
in
hecht
against
bowles
relied
on
that.
here
we
have
to
issue
an
injunction
and
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
an
injunction
and
other
appropriate
order
which
i
read
not
touching
your
present
argument
any
other
supplementary
order
to
the
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
here,
you
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
simply
say
that
in
hecht
against
bowles
doesn't
give
me
much
help
for
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
entirely
agree
with
you
for
the
court
has
given
discretion,
it
must
exercised
the
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
accompany
you
to
sketch
the
consideration
that
you
think
should
have
gone
through
the
district
court's
end
in
deciding
this
balancing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
basis
of
what
was
before
him
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
that's
the
wildest
kind
of
a
guess
even
though
mr.
frank
zinger
(ph)
and
mr.
woods
both
of
whom
i
know
well
and
greatly
respect
and
dr.
taylor
indicated
that.
you
don't
think
that's
the
widest
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
long
experience
or
living
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
it
is
to
learn
the
very
statement
on
which
you
relied
but
of
course
nobody
has
really
a
full
and
final
view
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
all
in
notion
of
speculations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
president
said
that.
the
president
mcdonald
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
that's
his
opinion,
opinion
and
appeal
that
is
really
shot
through
with
speculative
factors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
all
they
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
on
this
point,
that's
all
you
have
--
the
affidavit
of
the
president
of
the
steel
workers
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
his
forecast
which
deserve
a
great
deal
of
respect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
with
some
knowledge
of
settling
strikes
and
big
strikes
but
that's
a
very
speculative
judgment
that
anybody
can
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
settlement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
here
because
the
strike
is
on
fundamentally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
--
that's
my
point,
everybody
is
speculating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody's
speculating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
if
one
can
have
views
that
the
president
expressed
that
taft-hartley
isn't
salvation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
imagine
anything
that
there's
less
--
makes
less
of
a
judicial
appeal
to
grant
judges
to
forecast
how,
when,
and
what
manner
a
strikes
will
be
settled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
don't
think
that
speculation
which
poor
district
judge
is
having
who
may
not
have
had
any
experience
in
this
domain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
tell
that
it's
better
to
see
the
steel
mills
rather
than
you
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
envy
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
isn't
merely
to
break
the
strike.
we
have
known
lock-outs
in
the
history
of
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
what
about
if
there
is
anymore?
clearly
you
do
not
worry
about
those
anymore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
you're
--
you're
conceding
needlessly
by
saying
these
determinations
could
be
made
by
an
administrative
board
but
when
so
made
there
certainly
could
be
court
review
whether
there's
any
basis
for
making
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
don't
you
think
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
highest
officials
in
the
land
are
equal
to
an
administrative
agency?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
makes
orders
on
the
basis
of
its
opinion
still
before
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
two-thirds
of
your
argument
was
precisely
that,
that
there
wasn't
a
basis
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
i
don't
mean
that.
i
mean
your
--
your
--
two-thirds
of
your
argument
is
the
challenge,
the
foundation,
on
which
review
is
sought
because
congress
directed
it
be
sought
in
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
see
no
difference
between
opinions
expressed
by
the
president
and
its
cabinet
officers
and
the
opinions
expressed
by
the
icc
or
the
federal
communications
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
we
have
merely
an
expression
of
opinion
by
the
head
of
a
nation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
it's
equal
to
what
the
various
administrative
officials
define
for
their
head.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
expression
of
opinion,
because
the
thing
lies
in
the
realm
of
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
deference
if
there's
merely
the
relevance
of
entrusting
this
expression
of
opinion
in
the
one
person
presumably
best
qualified
in
the
greatest
responsibility
in
the
land
for
making
such
an
expression
of
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
didn't
want
to
do
that.
they
wanted
--
they
wanted
you
to
have
a
chance
to
go
to
the
court
and
challenge
the
basis
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
was
then
applied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
do
i
much
deduce
from
that
with
health
than
congress
offered
in
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
did
you
--
where
did
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
sought
to
meet
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
the
(inaudible)
under
the
goldberg's
argument
reaches
beyond
this
immediate
problem,
and
i
think
undercuts
the
step
you
are
now
making
that
they
didn't
raise
it,
the
claim
for
through
which
by
petition,
that
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
what
particularity
and
detail,
what
is
necessary
to
secure
the
supply
that
are
needed
for
security
purposes
or
safety
purposes
in
view
of
the
fact,
if
it'd
be
a
fact,
that
the
steel,
the
quantity
of
steel
needed
by
the
government,
those
will
be
sure
for
crucial
purposes,
is
mathematically
appointed
that
it
be
a
small
fraction
of
the
total
steel
production
of
the
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
--
that
is
the
argument,
isn't
it?
if
that
is
right,
you
must
affirmatively
show
what
is
needed
not
only
from
--
with
respective
plant
but
--
but
the
units
within
the
respective
plants,
and
that
was
not
made
out,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
also
end
up
(inaudible)
as
the
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
it
was
not
securable
from
the
unstruck
plant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
who
is
this,
is
that
in
the
secretary
gates,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
not
from
one
plant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this.
i
understand
that
there
is
something
less
than
about
20%
or
less
that
are
open
plants,
something
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
less
than
--
that
there
is
the
system,
the
terms
of
which
or
the
--
the
details
of
which
are
open
to
public
scrutiny,
available
to
public
knowledge
of
the
suppliers
for
what
the
various
officials
who
put
in
their
affidavit
and
given
their
affidavit
say,
are
needed
for
safety
purposes
for
various
etcetera,
etcetera.
do
i
understand
you
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
do
say
that
(inaudible)
do
not
these
affidavits
to
let
themselves
to
the
need
of
having
the
necessary
means
of
carrying
out
those
safe
--
those
security
programs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
what
you
said
earlier,
at
least
i
understood
you
to
say
that
none
of
the
plants,
none
of
the
open
plants,
supplied
the
materials
or
were
available
for
the
materials
which
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
general
manager
of
atomic
energy
commission,
etcetera,
etcetera,
gave
as
the
reasons
why
the
national
safety
was
involved.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
list
of
qualified
suppliers
is
a
matter
of
public
or
susceptible
of
public
knowledge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
did
say
something
about
its
(inaudible),
its
public
body.
justice
felix
frankfurter
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
--
to
qualify
--
one
(inaudible)
suppliers
qualify,
he
would
have
to
ascertain
who
the
government
contractors
are
to
some
of
these
weapons
or
products,
and
i
suppose
that
is
not
matter
of
public.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
supplier
would
then
know
to
whom
--
to
what
government
contractor
he
is
furnishing
his
materials
or
his
quality
of
kind
of
steel,
wouldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
who
is
seeking
it
and
i
--
i
don't
suppose
that
matter
of
public
notarizing,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
who
the
government
contractors
are,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
know
to
whom
to
go
for
their
need
of
--
of
steel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
quite
unqualified
and
say
that
no
open
mill
or
plant
whatever
the
public
term
is,
is
available
for
the
need
of
this
top
priority
the
government
needs,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
need
couldn't
be
met
from
this
open
non-supplier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
opened
non-suppliers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
annually?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
right
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
60%
of
what?
of
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
because
you're
thinking
--
you
don't
say
that
there
might
be?
there
might
be
[laughter]
there
would
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
you
--
even
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
you're
leaving
for
an
escalator
but
can't
possibly
design
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
do
you
have
to
bother
about
leaving
room
for
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
design
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

to
be
able
to
design
what
he
thinks
is
appropriate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
make
intellectual
estoppel
apply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
mr.
(inaudible)
would
like
you
to
--
would
like
to
hear
that,
would
he?
