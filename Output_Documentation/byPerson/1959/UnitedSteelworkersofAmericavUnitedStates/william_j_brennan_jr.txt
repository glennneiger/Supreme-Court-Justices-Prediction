justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
relevance
of
this
mr.
goldberg?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
goldberg,
you
said
the
president
used
the
exact
words
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
the
statute
has
imperiled
the
national
health
or
safety.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
goldberg,
suppose
we
imply
(inaudible),
is
it
your
position
that
the
findings
that
are
required
by
the
statute
must
be
that
the
national
health
and
safety
are
imperiled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
if
either.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
does
that
important
that
in
fact
to
either
is
could?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
court
did
make
findings
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
to
both.
if
there
are
proper
findings
as
to
either
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
statute
operates.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
goldberg?
how
you
view
findings
a
and
b?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
c
and
d,
of
course,
in
language
say
that
they
are
findings
of
imperiling
of
the
national
safety.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
--
what
i'm
interested
in
is
whether
you
read
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
each
of
them
as
a
finding
that
on
account
of
the
things
there
stated,
the
national
safety
is
imperiled.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
only
subdivision
e
is
related
to
the
national
health.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
are
there
any
other
findings
that
specifically
relates
to
either?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
public
health
though,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
--
could
that
--
to
see
if
i
an
understanding
your
position.
is
it
fairly
to
put
it
this
way
that
you
say
national
health
does
not
mean
the
health
of
the
nation
in
the
sense
of
the
well-being
of
the
nation,
it
means
the
physical
health
of
those
of
us
who
make
up
the
nation.
is
that
what
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
the
physical
health
of
the
individual?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
this?
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
itself
imports
a
grant
of
jurisdiction,
is
that
--
the
discretion,
is
that
your
thought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
support
have
you
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
support
have
you
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
any
colloquy
that
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
you're
saying
is
supposed,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
his
reading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
you
might
have
turned
the
inference
from
your
argument
that
the
congress
had
no
distinction
in
mind
between
national
health
on
the
one
hand
and
national
safety
on
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
that
situation,
an
injunction
might
go
under
the
statute
even
though
the
government
couldn't
prove
the
impairment
of
the
national
health
in
the
sense
that
you've
been
discussing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
preamble
covered
more
by
titles,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concern
on
this
record,
safety
deals
only
with
military
hardware,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
the
findings
before
us
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
issue
of
national
safety
deal
only
with
military
hardware,
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there's
no
other
findings
to
which
we
could
--
with
which
we
could
deal
on
a
boarder
interpretation
of
safety.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
conceive
that
something
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
should
be
says
that
there
is
a
narrow
area
of
discretion
you
don't
tell
us
to
cover
what.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
because
you
suggest
if
you
did,
there
might
be
a
constitutional
infirmity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
conceding
then
that
congress
intended
would
not
stand
in
the
finding
of
the
national
health
and
safety
as
a
peril.
but
nevertheless,
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
allow
an
injunction,
is
that
it?
within
somebody
at
least
to
a
--
to
judicial
discussion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
in
--
where
in
the
(inaudible)
legislative
history
you
would
find
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
telling
out
then
the
same
way
that
mr.
goldberg
did
out
of
--
in
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
or
the
language
granted
in
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
the
finding
is
a
narrow
discussion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
--
i
think
it
just
postponed
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understood

william
j.
brennan,
