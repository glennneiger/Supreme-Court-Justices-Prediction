justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
there
was
an
argument
some
years
ago
as
to
the
precise
practice
of
the
third
circuit
of
court
of
appeals
and
en
banc
hearings
and
rehearings.
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
health,
do
you
--
you
concede
that
it
could
reach
and
with
respect
to
national
safety.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
point
--
you're
not
referring
to
a
fraction
of
a
plant,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
also
include,
because
i
gather
what
your
argument
does,
that
in
fact
findings
of
a
strike
which
imperils
the
national
health
and
safety
appear.
justice
potter
stewart
but
nevertheless
you
say
that
there
is
a
discretion
in
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
any
intention
of
the
congress
that
he
should
have
a
discretion?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
from
the
word,
“shall
have
jurisdiction.”
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
congress
had
any
such
intention.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
referring
to
section
5,
paragraph
5
of
the
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
unanimous.
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
you're
right
about
that,
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
is
there
any
help
to
be
found
in
the
use
of
the
phrase,
“national
health
and
other
statutes
enacted
by
congress?”
justice
potter
stewart
is
national
health
a
--
a
unique
phrase
so
far
as
the
contemporary
enactment
of
--
enactments
of
congress
go?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
apart
from
this
argument
you're
now
making
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
steel
is
fungible
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
product
and
this
other
practical
problem
that
you're
telling
us
about.
do
you
accept
the
figure
that
i
understand
the
counsel
for
the
union
has
given
us
that
the
total
defense
need
in
terms
of
tonnage
is
around
1%
of
the
total
capacity
of
steel,
1%
or
140
million
tons
whatever
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
is
the
--
how
is
defense
needs
--
how
does
that
define
when
you're
talking
about
1%
or
2%?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
government
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
by
--
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
contractors
with
direct
contracts
to
the
government
itself
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
make
--
to
make
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
in
what
connection
was
the
statement
of
the
--
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
other
case
made
that
that
--
was
it
just
--
just
gratuitous
or
did
it
have
some
relevance
in
that
case?
the
statement
as
to
--
as
to
discretion
of
this
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
have
been
restricted
anyway.
