mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
the
honor
to
represent
the
petitioner,
the
united
steelworkers
of
america
in
this
proceeding.
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
affirming
the
injunction
order
issued
by
the
district
judge
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania,
judge
sorg.
in
order
to
understand
the
issues,
statutory,
equitable,
and
constitutional
involved,
it
is
necessary
that
i
give
some
of
the
background
facts.
united
steelworkers
of
america,
the
petitioner,
is
a
labor
organization
representing
approximately
1,250,000
workers
engaged
in
the
steel
and
fabricating
industries.
there
are
involved
in
the
strike
which
will
be
the
subject
to
the
court's
attention,
more
than
500,000
members
of
the
union,
the
employees
of
the
defendant
company.
it
is
important
for
me
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
steelworkers
union
has
separate
agreements
with
the
companies
which
are
likewise
parties-defendant
to
this
lawsuit.
originally,
there
were
97
companies.
one
of
the
companies
was
dismissed
by
agreement
in
the
district
court
and
one
of
the
companies,
the
kaiser
steel
corporation
was
dismissed
by
stipulation
in
the
court
of
appeals,
following
a
settlement
of
the
dispute
with
the
union
which
took
place
after
the
case
was
decided
in
the
district
court.
it
is
also
necessary
for
me
to
point
out
because
i
shall
advert
to
it
later,
that
the
union
is
separately
certified
as
the
bargaining
agent
with
respect
to
each
of
these
companies.
and
in
fact
in
many
of
these
companies,
they're
certified
not
on
a
company
basis
but
even
on
a
plant
basis.
the
contracts
with
the
companies,
who
are
at
bar,
the
collective
agreements
expired
by
and
large
with
few
exceptions
on
june
30th,
1959.
at
the
request
of
president
eisenhower,
an
extension
of
these
agreements
was
made
for
a
period
of
14
days.
and
following
the
expiration
of
the
extension
agreements
with
the
defendant
companies,
strikes
occurred,
and
i
emphasize
strikes
not
a
strike,
strikes
occurred
at
the
different
plants
and
companies.
the
record
shows
without
contradiction
and
it
is
uncontroverted
that
the
strikes
which
occurred
resulted
in
a
shutdown
of
310
steel
plants,
of
a
118
iron
ore
companies
and
of
shipping
and
other
transportation
facilities
connected
with
the
basic
steel
industry.
now,
these
companies
who
are
at
bar,
originally,
before
the
kaiser
settlement
produced
84
and
6/10th
percent
of
the
total
steel
capacity
of
the
united
states.
i
might
point
out
to
you
and
it
appears
in
the
record
that
the
present
steel
capacity
of
the
united
states
is
140,633,000
odd
tons
of
steel.
these
are
ingot
tons.
in
the
steel
making
process
approximately
20%
to
30%
of
ingot
tons
is
lost
in
the
finishing
process
of
finished
steel.
this
is
not
completely
lost
because
with
the
great
technological
development
in
steel,
this
steel
which
is
lost
is
reduced
to
scrap.
it
is
called
the
internal
scrap
in
the
steel
industry,
it
goes
back
into
the
furnaces
and
again
constitutes
part
of
the
essential
process
of
making
steel.
it
is
likewise
important
to
note
that
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
filed
an
excess
of
15%,
15.36%
to
be
exact,
of
the
total
capacity
of
the
steel
industry
embracing
some
63
companies
were
not
struck.
the
majority
of
these
operated
under
agreements
with
the
steelworkers
union
expiring
on
different
dates.
some
of
them
had
the
extension
agreements,
and
a
few
of
these
companies
were
not
organized
or
represented
by
the
steelworkers
union.
now,
these
companies
are
not
insubstantial
in
character.
they
have
a
total
capacity
of
20
--
22,683,480
tons.
and
these
figures
become
relevant
in
connection
with
a
discussion
of
the
evidence
a
little
later
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
now,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
following
the
commencement
to
these
proceedings,
the
kaiser
steel
corporation
settled
with
the
union.
this
company,
one
of
the
12
largest
companies
in
the
steel
industry,
has
a
capacity
of
about
2%
of
the
total
steel
production
of
the
united
states
or
approximately
3
million
tons.
so
there
has
been
added
to
the
present
capacity
not
on
strike.
these
3
million
tons
that
we
may
then
in
round
numbers
assert
that
the
companies
not
on
strike
produce
and
are
capable
of
producing
approximately
25
million
tons
of
steel.
it
is
also
relevant
to
note
that
the
production
before
the
strike
from
january
1st
to
july
14th
on
the
part
of
the
companies,
they
were
all
not
on
strike
at
that
time,
was
an
extraordinary
production.
none
in
the
companies
produced
in
anticipation
of
the
strike.
in
any
event,
for
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year,
the
record
shows
that
the
total
steel
production
of
the
united
states
amounted
to
72,479,609
tons,
and
this
of
course
is
supplemented
by
imports
of
steel
into
the
united
states
which
would
be
an
addition
to
this
amount.
there
are
three
months
yet
unaccounted
for
in
our
summary
of
steel
production,
and
even
if
the
strike
were
to
go
on,
and
we
hope
and
pray
it
won't,
for
the
balance
of
the
three
months,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
total
production
for
the
year
1959
will
be
very
close
to
equal
the
entire
non-strike
year
of
1958
for
the
whole
industry,
which
amounted
to
85,254,885
tons.
later
i
shall
be
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
relates
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
sufficient
steel
to
meet
the
health
and
safety
requirements
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
254,000
tons.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
for
this
year,
so
far
for
nine
months
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
nine
months
--
we
don't
have
the
whole
year
--
72,479,000
tons.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
total
steel
making
capacity
of
the
united
states.
last
year
was
a
recession
year.
the
steel
industry
did
not
produce
to
its
capacity.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
oh
yes.
yes,
there
has
been
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
pardon,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
this
has
been
growing
rapidly
year
by
year.
so
that
the
steel
capacity
of
the
united
states
is
--
is
--
the
increase
is
due
to
two
factors,
new
investment
and
new
plant
and
modernization
and
technological
improvement
of
existing
plant.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
the
old
facilities
too,
three
categories
at
the
interim.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
are
a
substantial
factor
in
this.
now,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
strike
of
the
union,
the
strikes
against
these
various
companies,
continued
--
started
july
14th,
continued
through
the
months
of
july,
august,
and
september
and
they
still
continue
except
in
this
lawsuit
as
to
kaiser
which
settled.
finally,
on
october
9,
1959,
the
president
invoked
the
procedures
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
which
we
popularly
called
the
taft-hartley
act
and
he
invoked
the
sections
of
the
law
which
we
commonly
referred
to
and
is
referred
to
in
the
statute
by
title
as
the
national
emergency
sections
of
that
act.
i
shall
have
frequent
occasions
to
refer
to
that
statute.
it
is
set
forth
in
full
text
in
page
94
of
government's
first
brief.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
record
shows
they
are
operating
under
extension
agreements
with
the
union
and
most
--
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
this,
but
i
can
tell
your
honor
that
most
of
these
extension
agreements
provide
that
they're
extended
until
there
is
a
settlement
in
the
basic
steel
industry.
and
some
of
them
of
course
do
not
expire
at
all
during
this
period.
the
president
on
october
9,
1959,
invoked
the
procedures
specified
in
the
statute
and
then
i
will
not
take
time
now
to
advert
to
those
procedures,
because
i
want
to
later
make
an
analysis
and
full
argumentation
on
those
procedures,
but
for
the
purpose
of
chronology,
for
the
setting
of
this
case
i
would
like
to
go
on
and
give
you
the
time
sequence.
under
that
statute,
the
president
issued
an
executive
order,
10843,
which
is
set
forth
on
page
9
of
the
record
of
this
case.
in
that
executive
order,
the
president
expressed
the
opinion,
i
emphasize
opinion,
because
the
president
was
complying
with
the
statute,
he
did
not
make
a
finding,
an
opinion
that
the
strike
if
permitted
to
continue
will
imperil
the
national
health
or
safety
--
and
safety.
and
thereupon,
he
appointed
a
board
of
inquiry
to
inquire
into
the
facts
of
the
dispute.
the
board
of
inquiry
as
your
honors
well
know
was
headed
by
dr.
george
taylor
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania.
in
connection
with
the
appointment
of
the
board
of
inquiry,
the
president
also
made
a
statement
which
is
set
forth
on
page
10
of
the
record,
and
in
that
statement
the
president
said,
and
this
is
relevant
to
an
argument
which
i
shall
make
later.
you'll
find
in
the
third
paragraph
of
the
statement
of
the
president,
in
the
last
sentence.
“if
production
is
not
quickly
resumed,
severe
effects
upon
the
economy
will
endanger
the
economic
health
of
the
nation.”
i
underline
for
this
purpose
the
word
“economic
health
of
the
nation”
because
i
shall
challenge
this
later
as
going
to
one
of
the
essential
aspects
of
this
case.
the
board
of
inquiry
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
he
did.
but
then
he
went
on
and
he
talked
about
economic
and
later
i
shall
go
back
to
safety
but
economic
health
was
the
term
he
used
to
describe
his
conception
of
health.
the
board
of
inquiry
was
directed
to
report,
it
was
appointed
on
october
9th.
it
was
directed
to
report
on
or
before
october
16.
however,
the
board
felt
they'd
needed
more
time,
requested
the
president
for
an
extension,
and
by
another
executive
order
which
is
found
on
page
11
of
the
record,
the
president
extended
the
time
until
october
19.
the
board
held
hearings
for
several
days,
october
12th,
13th,
14th,
15th
and
also
on
the
18th
and
on
the
19th,
the
board
reported
to
the
president
and
the
report
is
set
forth
in
the
record
before
you.
now,
under
the
procedures
of
the
statute,
the
board
of
inquiry
is
mandated
to
find,
in
effect,
to
make
a
finding
on
the
facts
and
to
state
the
positions
of
the
parties,
but
is
not
authorized
to
make
any
recommendations.
on
the
same
day
that
the
board
of
inquiry
handed
down
its
report
to
the
president,
the
president
directed
the
attorney
general
to
bring
this
injunction
action
and
his
direction
to
the
attorney
general
is
contained
in
a
letter
which
is
set
forth
on
page
8
of
the
record.
and
hereto,
i
wish
to
point
out
to
you
that
in
this
letter
in
the
third
paragraph,
again
the
president
makes
no
finding
of
fact
as
we
--
we
lawyers
understand
the
term,
but
expresses
his
opinion.
“in
my
opinion,
this
unresolved
labor
dispute
has
resulted
in
a
strike”
and
i
skip,
“which
strike
will,
if
permitted
to
continue,
imperil
the
national
health
and
safety.”
here
he
uses
the
exact
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
it
looks
to
the
future
but
there's
a
sense
of
immediacy
about
the
term
imperil.
it
is
not
as
my
distinguished
friend,
the
solicitor
general
suggests,
a
word
like
“affect”.
the
word
“imperil”
has
peril
in
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it's
an
opinion
of
a
forecast.
it
is
not
a
finding
however,
based
upon
hearing,
as
when
i
said,
as
we
lawyers
understand.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it's
a
forecast
as
to
the
future,
a
prophecy.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no
not
the
exact
but
i
meant
in
terms
of
national
heath
and
safety
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
health
and
of
safety.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
right.
yes.
in
the
--
you're
correct
mr.
justice
brennan
i
stand
corrected.
and
here's
we
have
an
opinion
that
it
does
both
here
and
if
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no
it
does
not.
the
president
was
scrupulously
following
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
do
not
quarrel
that
the
president
did
not
follow
the
statute.
to
follow
--
the
president
was
scrupulously
following
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
--
as
i
said
the
--
that
the
direct
to
the
attorney
general
was
directed
to
him
on
october
19th
and
the
following
day,
the
government
filed
its
petition
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court
in
pennsylvania
in
the
western
district
against
the
union.
and
the
--
at
that
time
as
i've
said
the
97
companies
i
should
point
out
to
you
and
i
want
to
say
that
the
government
courteously
communicated
with
the
union,
its
counsel,
the
person
of
myself,
and
with
counsel
for
the
industry
gave
us
notice
that
it
was
going
to
make
this
application
and
in
fact
on
the
day
before
the
hearing
commenced,
we
exchanged
pleadings,
they
gave
me
a
copy
of
the
petition
so
that
i
was
able
to
file
an
answer.
we
exchanged
affidavits
which
i
shall
talk
about
in
a
moment
and
we
executed
a
stipulation
about
which
i
shall
also
advert
in
a
few
minutes.
the
district
court
action
in
pennsylvania
was
commenced
on
october
the
20th
and
it
was
tried
before
the
district
court
on
the
afternoon
of
october
20.
when
i
say
tried,
i
emphasize
tried.
we
stipulated
that
the
cause
should
be
heard
on
final
hearing
on
the
pleadings,
the
petition,
and
the
answer
that
i
filed,
the
defendant-companies
waived
the
filing
of
an
answer
and
find
the
affidavits.
so
that
the
case
would
be
in
the
posture
once
the
district
court
decided
it,
of
entering
a
final
order.
as
final
an
order
as
you
can
enter
under
the
taft-hartley
injunction
procedure.
the
case
was
submitted,
the
transcript
shows
the
afternoon
of
that
day,
the
--
we
--
we
submitted
our
affidavits
to
the
district
judge
and
my
friend,
the
assistant
attorney
general,
mr.
doub
(ph)
and
i
argued
the
case
before
the
district
judge.
we
have
both
prepared
trial
memoranda,
and
these
were
made
available
to
the
district
judge.
the
companies
confined
themselves
to
a
brief
statement
that
they
do
not
feel
it
appropriate
to
discuss
the
merits
but
that
they
would
want
to
be
heard
on
the
terms
of
the
injunction
order
and
that
was
their
participation
in
the
trial
of
the
case
that
took
place.
the
district
judge
late,
early
evening
actually
of
october
the
20th
took
the
case
under
advisement.
the
next
morning
he
asked
counsel
to
--
this
all
appears
in
the
record
and
the
transcript
was
made
of
the
part
at
least
of
the
chamber
proceeding
not
all
unfortunately,
but
part
of
it.
and
when
i
say
unfortunate,
it
was
not
due
it
any
--
of
any
lack
of
concern
of
the
district
judge.
and
as
soon
as
when
he
started
to
talk
about
the
findings
and
he
realized
we
were
making
objections,
he
courteously
said
he
thought
that
there
ought
to
be
a
record
and
he
invited
the
court
reporter
in
to
make
a
record.
and
as
the
record
shows,
there,
most
of
the
discussions
report
the
district
judge
on
the
findings
is
included
in
the
record.
the
--
morning
the
district
judge
called
counsel
into
chambers
and
right
off,
indicated
that
he
has
decided
that
the
government
had
made
a
case
and
he
would
issue
the
injunction.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
was
the
--
october
21st.
we
concluded
on
the
afternoon
of
october
20th.
october
21st,
the
judge
entered
into
this
chamber
discussion
with
counsel
and
later
that
afternoon
entered
the
injunction
order.
the
government
tendered
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
and
on
behalf
of
the
union,
i
tendered
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
we
also
filed
objections
to
the
government's
proposed
points
which
are
stated
in
the
record.
the
findings
of
the
district
court
the
--
the
--
i
might
say
that
the
district
judge
sustained
some
of
the
objections
which
we
filed.
and
the
government
consented
to
deletion
of
some
language
in
the
findings
as
going
beyond
the
affidavits
that
they
filed
or
as
not
being
sustained
by
the
affidavits
that
they
filed.
the
findings
of
the
district
judge
are
to
be
found
commencing
on
page
244
of
the
record
and
the
injunction
is
to
be
found
at
page
249
of
the
record.
i'm
going
to
discuss
those
findings
later
in
some
specific
detail.
here
again,
i
mention
this
for
chronological
purposes.
in
substance,
the
district
judge
found
that
the
strike
affects,
strikes
that
are
against
this
company,
affects
the
steel
--
affect
the
steel
industry
or
a
substantial
part
thereof,
and
if
permitted
to
continue,
will
imperil
the
national
health
and
safety.
the
judge
issued
no
opinion.
that
afternoon,
he
appeared
on
the
bench,
he
announced
that
he
felt
that
the
government
had
made
a
case
and
he
was
going
to
enter
the
injunction
order
and
signed
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
which
had
been
tendered
by
the
government
with
the
amendments
and
deletions
that
have
been
developed
in
our
discussion
in
chambers.
on
the
same
--
on
the
same
afternoon,
following
this,
the
district
judge
permitted
a
short
stay
of
the
injunction
order
to
enable
me
to
present
my
application
for
a
further
stay
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
it
so
happened
that
judge
staley,
a
--
a
member
of
that
court
was
in
pittsburgh
his
home.
the
judge
--
the
solicitor
judge
communicated
with
judge
staley.
he
told
us
he
had
and
judge
staley
was
kind
enough
to
advise
the
district
judge
and
the
district
judge
advised
us
that
he
would
appear
promptly
after
the
district
judge
had
disposed
of
the
matter
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
my
application
for
a
stay.
judge
staley
within,
i
would
say
35
or
40
minutes
after
the
district
judge
had
issued
the
order
and
the
--
what
maybe
called
short
stay,
appeared
in
open
court
and
i
presented
to
him
the
application
of
the
union
for
a
stay,
pending
the
filing
of
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
judge
staley
at
that
time
asked
whether
the
government
and
ourselves
were
prepared
to
proceed
next
morning
to
philadelphia
to
present
an
application
to
the
full
--
to
a
panel
of
the
full
court.
and
also
said
that
he,
after
his
conversation
with
judge
sorg,
that's
been
in
communication
with
chief
judge
biggs,
and
that
a
panel
of
that
court
would
be
available
in
philadelphia
at
10
o'clock
the
next
morning.
after
argument
on
the
application
for
restraint,
the
government
opposed.
judge
staley
entered
an
order
staying
the
order
of
the
district
judge,
the
injunction
order,
until
we
have
an
opportunity
to
appear
10
o'clock
the
next
morning
before
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
comforted
ourselves
to
this
order
and
we
appeared,
and
this
now
is
thursday,
october
22nd.
we
there
appeared
the
next
morning
in
philadelphia
before
a
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
consisting
of
chief
judge
biggs,
judge
goodrich,
and
judge
hastie.
we
presented
at
that
time
as
we
were
required
to
do
under
judge
staley's
order
if
they
wanted
to
stay
to
continue
an
effect,
an
application
for
a
further
stay
and
a
motion
for
expedited
procedure
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
then
asked
us
and
counsel
for
the
government
whether
we
would
agree
to
submit
the
case
on
its
merits
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
morning.
on
the
memorandum
--
memoranda
filed
in
the
district
court
and
oral
arguments.
we
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
22nd.
this
is
10
o'clock
in
the
morning,
the
22nd.
we
agreed,
we
agreed.
and
the
government,
after
consultation
with
the
attorney
general
likewise
agreed.
then
we
proceeded
to
a
hearing
before
the
court
of
appeals
an
argument,
a
final
hearing
on
the
merits
there.
we
argued
the
case
orally,
and
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
a
question
of
the
stay,
judge
hastie
inquired
as
to
whether
the
stay
should
continue
on
paragraph
five
of
the
injunction
order.
this
was
a
paragraph
of
the
injunction
order
following
the
statute,
which
requires
the
parties
to
bargain
with
each
other
during
the
continuation
of
the
injunction.
we
said
that
we
regarded
it
to
be
our
obligation
and
we
arranged
this
to
continue
the
bargain.
we
have
no
objection
to
that
part
of
the
order
remaining
in
effect.
and
so
the
stay
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
was
then
granted
the
full
--
the
full
panel,
pending
their
disposition
of
the
case
exempted
from
the
stay
order
that
paragraph
five
of
the
injunction
which
required
the
parties
to
bargain.
and
in
fact
bargaining
took
place
by
the
court
of
appeals,
unsuccessful
bargaining
i
should
add,
took
place
in
the
court
of
appeals
while
the
court
of
appeals
was
considering
this
matter.
we
--
we
concluded
our
arguments.
the
court,
as
this
court
did,
put
no
limitation
upon
time
of
argument,
gave
us
an
ample
opportunity
to
argue
on
the
memorandum
filed
in
the
district
court.
we
had
no
time
to
prepare
at
noon,
and
we
didn't
ask
for
it.
and
on
the
following
thursday,
we
now
jump
from
october
22nd.
on
the
following
thursday,
october
27,
the
court
handed
down
its
opinion.
on
the
following
tuesday,
october
27,
the
court
handed
down
its
opinion.
opinion
of
the
court
was
a
divided
opinion
--
the
opinion
of
the
judges
was
a
divided
opinion.
chief
justice
biggs
delivered
the
opinion
of
the
court
concurred
in
by
judge
goodrich.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
was
no
objection,
but
later,
your
honor,
i
want
to
make
some
observations
about
it.
there's
no
objection
because
of
certain
reasons
peculiar
to
this
type
of
procedure,
which
i
would
like
to
talk
about
later.
the
--
the
court
divided.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
has
a
procedure
where
they
circulate
their
opinions
by
the
panel
among
the
entire
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
rehearing
before
and
then
was
to
be
held.
the
--
simultaneously
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
an
order
of
the
court
was
entered
reporting
that
on
this
circulation
for
a
rehearing
requesting
opinions
as
to
rehearing,
the
court
had
equally
divided
three
and
three.
judge
kalodner
had
disqualified
himself.
three
judges
thought
there
ought
to
be
a
rehearing
and
three
judges
thought
there
ought
not
to
be
a
rehearing.
three
judges
who
thought
there
ought
to
be
a
rehearing
said
that
for
the
reasons
stated
by
judge
hastie
in
his
dissent,
they
felt
there
ought
to
be
a
rehearing
and
the
other
three
judges
felt
that
for
the
reason
stated
by
chief
judge
biggs,
there
ought
not
to
be.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
they
--
they
could
not
have
had
it
very
long
because
between
the
argument
date
and
the
opinion
date
only
five
days
intervene.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
on
friday,
this
is
--
we
now
come
to
the
27th.
on
friday,
october
3rd,
we
filed
our
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
it
was
granted
on
the
same
day.
we
argued
today
on
tuesday,
november
the
3rd.
this
is
exactly
two
weeks.
the
case
has
proceeded
on
final
hearing,
two,
three
courts
to,
through
two
courts
and
now
in
the
supreme
court.
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
asked
about
an
objection,
whether
i
objected
to
this,
and
i
will
say
at
this
point
and
later
i
want
to
explain
the
nature
of
my
comments,
not
an
objection,
that
while
justice
delayed
is
justice
denied,
i
will
raise
the
question
later
as
to
whether
under
the
procedures
specified
in
the
statute
and
with
no
criticism
of
the
courts
below.
and
in
fact,
commendation
for
their
expedition,
whether
the
procedure
necessarily
entailed
in
the
statute
is
compatible
with
the
judicial
process.
and
then
i
would
like
to
comment
on
at
a
later
stage
of
the
argument.
and
may
it
please
the
courts,
i
now
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
on
this
chronology
of
events
which
i
shall
amplify
in
particular
points
that
the
injunction
order
should
be
reversed
for
the
following
reasons.
one,
findings
of
the
district
court
as
to
national
health
and
safety
were
based
on
an
erroneous
reading
of
the
statute,
and
even
if
that
reading
were
accepted,
which
i
don't
think
should
be
done,
were
unsupported
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.
two,
the
judgment
of
the
below,
judgment
below,
should
be
reversed
even
if
the
government
met
the
burden
of
proving
that
health
and
safety
were
imperiled,
because
on
the
equities
of
this
case
and
the
reasonable
exercise
of
the
equity,
the
injunction
should
have
been
denied.
and
three,
the
80-day
injunction
provisions
of
the
statute
are
unconstitutional
as
they
confer
on
the
district
courts
duties
which
are
not
judicial
and
are
not
connected
with
any
case
in
controversy
and
are
therefore
outside
the
limits
of
article
iii
section
2
of
the
judiciary
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
either
one,
either
one.
but
the
court
here
made
findings
on
both.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
didn't
get
that.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
then
we
would
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
then
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
now
i
do
--
i
start
first
with
the
findings
of
the
district
court
as
to
national
health
and
safety.
this
statute
is
commonly
known
as
the
--
as
the
national
emergency
provision
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
perhaps
at
this
stage
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute
which
is
set
forth
in
appendix
b,
page
94
of
the
government's
brief.
statute
starts
off
in
section
206
with
the
recital
that
“whenever
in
the
opinion
about
the
president
of
the
united
states,”
and
i
shall
not
read
all
the
words,
but
the
pertinent
words,
“a
threatened
or
actual
strike
or
lock-out
affecting
an
entire
industry
or
substantial
part
thereof
engaged
in
trade,
commerce,
transportation,
transmission
or
communication
among
the
several
states
or
with
foreign
nations
or
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
will,
if
permitted
to
occur
or
to
continue,
imperil
the
national
health
or
safety,
he
may
appoint
a
board
of
inquiry
to
inquire
to
the
issues
involved
in
the
dispute.”
i
emphasize
here
the
keywords
“a
strike
or
lock-out
affecting
an
entire
industry
or
a
substantial
part
thereof
will,
if
permitted
to
occur
or
to
continue,
imperil
the
national
health
or
safety.”
and
i
emphasize
also
the
following
word
“he
may
appoint
a
board
of
inquiry”.
this
is
a
discretionary,
of
course,
with
the
president.
section
207
deals
with
the
composition
of
the
board
of
inquiry.
and
it
is
not
pertinent
here,
and
except
as
i
shall
later
point
out
that
the
board
of
inquiry
made
no
finding
on
the
national
emergency
issue
and
i,
myself,
think
this
is
a
proper
reading
of
the
statute
that
it
shall
not,
although
many
boards
of
inquiry
had.
that
dr.
taylor,
when
he
convened
this
board
of
inquiry,
made
a
statement
that
he
does
not
regard
this
to
be
disfunction,
because
he
says
that
his
function
is
to
ascertain
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
causes
and
circumstances
of
the
dispute.
and
he
--
we
have
a
dispute
with
the
steel
industry
and
various
companies
and
he
did
not
regard
that
to
be
pertinent.
i
shall
later
tell
you
that
i
offered
some
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
advising
the
president
and
the
government
long
in
advance
of
this
hearing
order,
long
in
advance
as
this
--
this
hasty
schedule
permitted.
now
if
this
point
was
going
to
be
raised
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
board.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that
dr.
taylor
said
it
was
not
pertinent,
he
would
take
it
and
transmit
it
to
the
president.
the
key
section,
the
section
208,
“upon
receiving
a
report
from
the
board
of
inquiry,
president
may
direct
the
attorney
general”,
again,
we
have
may,
to
petition
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
to
enjoin
such
strike
or
a
lock-out
for
the
continuing
thereof,
and
if
the
court
finds”,
that's
the
keyword
here.
before
we
have
had
the
statement,
“if
the
president
is
of
the
opinion”,
but
now
it
changes.
now,
“if
the
court
finds
that
the
threatened
or
actual
strike
or
lock-out
affects
an
entire
industry
or
substantial
part
thereof
and,
if
permitted
to
occur
or
to
continue,
will
imperil
the
national
health
or
safety”,
then
there
are
some
keywords.
“it
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
any
such
strike,
any
such
strike
or
lock-out,
or
the
continuing
thereof,”
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“any”,
“and
to
make
such
other
orders
as
may
be
appropriate.”
then
the
next
section
is
also
important.
there
is
a
pro
tanto
repealing
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act.
in
case
the
provisions
of
the
act
--
in
any
case
the
provisions
of
the
act
from
march
23,
1932
entitled,
etcetera,
shall
not
be
applicable.
then
we
go
on
because
this
triggers
an
administrative
procedure,
but
if
you'll
go
on
to
--
there's
a
review
provision,
section
209.
when
the
district
court
issues
the
order,
then
it's
the
duty
of
the
parties
to
make
every
effort
to
adjust
and
settle
their
differences.
that
it
was
this
part
of
the
injunction
order
which
after
suggestion
of
judge
hastie
was
not
stated.
then
there's
another
procedure.
upon
the
issuance
of
such
order,
the
president
shall
reconvene
the
board
of
inquiry
which
has
previously
reported
with
respect
to
the
dispute.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
this
particular
dispute,
it
has
apparently
been
the
opinion
of
the
government
that
that
board
of
inquiry
cannot
be
convened
until
triggered
by
the
injunction.
and
dr.
taylor
and
his
colleagues
have
not
been
called
back
into
session.
we
have
been
reading
here
the
last
few
days
under
the
auspices
of
the
mediation
service.
at
the
end
of
a
60-day
period,
unless
the
dispute
has
been
settled
by
that
time,
the
board
of
inquiry
shall
report
to
the
president
the
current
position
of
the
parties,
offers
which
have
been
made
for
settlement,
and
shall
include
a
statement
by
each
party
of
its
position,
and
statement,
if
there's
something
new
of
the
employers'
last
offer
of
settlement.
the
president
shall
make
such
report
available
to
the
public.
now
we
have
something
new
injected.
there
we
have
the
national
labor
relations
board
within
the
succeeding
15
days
shall
take
a
secret
ballot
of
the
employees
of
each
employer.
so
in
this
great
dispute
a
ballot
would
have
to
be
taken
separately
for
each
company
on
the
question
of
whether
they
wish
to
accept
the
final
offer
of
settlement
made
by
their
employer
as
stated
by
him
and
shall
certify
the
results
with
the
attorney
general
within
eight
days
thereafter.
now
you,
--
with
five
days
thereafter.
now
you
notice
that
if
the
strike
is
settled
beforehand,
this
procedure
does
not
follow.
and
we
will
later
see
that
in
the
next
section,
the
attorney
general
must
discharge
an
injunction
as,
in
effect,
he
did
at
the
kaiser
steel
corporation
when
a
settlement
was
reached.
then
the
following,
on
the
final
paragraph,
upon
certification
of
the
results
of
such
ballot
or
upon
a
settlement
being
reached,
whichever
happen
sooner,
the
attorney
general
shall
move
the
court,
here
we
come
to
mandatory
language,
to
discharge
the
injunction,
which
motion
shall
then
be
granted
and
the
injunction
discharged
and
then,
because
it's
conceivable,
the
strike
might
still
be
resumed.
and
a
final
step
in
this
procedure,
when
such
a
motion
is
granted,
the
president
shall
submit
to
the
congress
a
full
and
comprehensive
report
of
the
proceedings
including
the
findings
of
the
board
of
inquiry
and
the
ballot
taken
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
together
with
such
recommendations
that
he
may
see
fit
to
make
for
consideration
and
appropriate
action.
this
has
been
properly
called
the
80-day
injunction
section.
it
is
not
actually
an
80-day.
it
maybe
as
it
was
in
kaiser
a
few
days,
depending
upon
whether
the
matter
is
settled.
now
this
is
a
very
involved
procedure
involving
president,
the
attorney
general,
the
federal
courts,
the
conciliation
service,
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
if
your
honor
will
permit
a
note
of
congressional
humor
in
this
situation,
the
minority
in
the
house
criticizing
this
emergency
section
in
a
--
little
earlier
version
but
not
substantially
different,
the
house,
minority
report
number
245
said
this.
“under
sections
203
and
204
the
president,
the
attorney
general,
the
district
courts,
the
secretary
of
labor”,
he
was
put
out
of
this
in
the
final
version,
“the
office
of
conciliation,
the
administrator
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
special
boards
would
all
be
concerned
with
the
handling
of
the
most
vital
disputes
in
the
country
affecting
the
national
health
and
safety.
everybody
seems
to
be
in
the
act
except
jimmy
durante.
the
--
i
now
turn
to
my
analysis
of
the
--
appropriate
analysis
of
this
statute.
and
here
on
health
and
safety,
we
come
to
one
of
the
substantial
parts
of
this
case.
and
our
argument
here
can
be
briefly
summarized
this
way.
acquisition
of
jurisdiction
by
the
district
court
in
the
case
and
its
issuance
of
the
injunction
were
based
upon
two
determinations
made
by
the
district
court.
and
this
relates
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
one,
national
health
in
the
sense
of
economic
well-being
will
be
imperiled,
because
the
steel
strike
will
adversely
effect
business,
idle
workers
and
facilities
dependent
upon
steel.
this
is
apparent,
if
you
will
look
at
the
findings,
on
page
247.
and
i
refer
you
specifically
to
the
finding
(e)
where
the
district
judge,
at
the
request
of
the
government
which
likewise
adopted
the
theory
that
economic
well-being
is
synonymous
with
national
health,
really
find
that
a
continuation
of
the
strike
will
have
the
ultimate
effect
of
adversely
affecting,
millions
of
small
business
enterprises.
almost
all
of
which
are
directly
or
indirectly
dependent
upon
steel
products
and
most
of
which
lack
the
resources
to
stock
large
amount.
and
additionally,
will
have
the
effect
of
idling
millions
of
worker
and
a
large
proportion
of
facilities
and
industries
dependent
upon
steel
for
their
continued
operation.
manufacturing
industries
dependent
on
steel
products,
account
for
the
employment
of
approximately
6
million
workers.
their
normal
wages
and
salaries
total
proximity
$34
billion.
products
of
these
industries
are
valued
at
over
a
$125
billion.
the
national
health
will
be
in
imperiled
if
strike
is
permitted
to
continue.
i
shall,
in
a
moment,
address
myself
to
whether
that
is
a
correct
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
a
and
b
relate
to
the
safety
of
the
country
in
the
national
defense
program
and
i
will
talk
about
those
specifically.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
a,
b,
and
c
relate
to
d
--
c
relate
to
safety.
d,
as
i
read
it,
relates
to
our
foreign
affairs,
and
e
relates
to
economic
health
of
the
country.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
do.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
these
are
the
substantive
findings
of
the
district
judge.
the
--
the
or
there,
i
should
correct
myself.
there's
also
13
which
also
relates
to
economic
health.
where
they
--
where
they
talk
about
unemployment,
where
they
talk
about
the
number
of
people
unemployed.
i
shall
deal
with
that
in
my
discussion
of
economic
health.
now
on
the
second
theory
of
the
government
adopted
by
the
district
court,
is
that
national
safety
will
be
imperiled
because
the
shortage
of
certain
steel
affects
the
progress
of
certain
defense
activities.
this
is
the
finding
mr.
justice
brennan
that
you
just
adverted
to.
now
in
my
opinion,
and
upon
the
congressional
history
and
a
plain
meaning
of
the
act,
each
determination
is
based
upon
a
serious
misreading
of
the
statute.
first,
economic
health
is
not
relevant
to
health
in
the
statutory
sentence.
and
peril
is
second,
peril
to
safety,
if
any
there
be
in
this
situation,
and
we
deny
that
there
is
any
peril
to
safety,
arises
and
stands
from
a
shutdown
of
a
minute
part
of
the
steel
industry.
and
as
i
shall
later
point
out,
this
does
not
confer
upon
the
district
court.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
deny
it
and
i
also
say
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
do.
i
shall
deal
with
in
the
argument.
i
say
that
the
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
even
if
it
imperiled
national
safety.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now
i
would
like
to
turn
to
a
more
detailed
discussion
of
economic
health,
when
we
--
economic
well-being
really,
as
not
fitting
in
the
statutory
definition
of
health.
i
read
to
you
--
you've
seen
the
findings,
unemployment
and
the
finding
that
business
will
be
adversely
affected.
these
are
the
two
belts
of
the
government's
case
on
this
issue
and
the
district
judge's
finding.
now
there's
no
evidence
related
--
in
this
record
related
to
physical
health,
none
at
all.
they
have
several
affidavits
by
the
government.
there
is
no
affidavit
from
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare.
there
is
no
discussion
except
some
discussion
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
relating
to
the
containers
in
a
conventional
sense
of
food
shortage,
impairment
of
hospital
and
medical
care,
lack
of
heating,
or
the
like.
nothing
is
on
record
in
respect
to
physical
health.
now
it's
interesting,
i've
referred
you
to
the
president
who
talked
in
one
of
the
statements
about
economic
health,
economic
well-being.
permeating
the
government's
case
are
references
of
a
light
character.
secretary
mitchell
whose
statement
is
found
on
173
of
the
record
refers
to
the
economic
health
of
the
country.
the
small
--
the--
the
administrator
of
the
small
business
administration
whose
affidavit
is
found
on
record
184
refers
to
the
economic
health
of
the
country,
well-being.
now
to
extend
health
in
this
way,
in
my
opinion,
runs
contrary
to
the
whole
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
as
your
honors
well
know
when
the
great
congressional
debate
was
taking
place
with
respect
to
taft-hartley,
two
bills
were
passed
and
they
were
separate
bills.
one
was
passed
in
the
house
and
one
was
passed
in
the
senate.
the
house
bill
referred
to
national
health
or
safety
or
interest,
three
words,
health,
safety,
or
interest.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
at
times
there
were
discussions
of
public
health
and
even
in
this
statute,
we'll
talk
about
the
statement
of
purposes
in
just
a
moment,
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
was
some
reference
to
public
hereto.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
physical
health.
it
means
physical
health
and
not
economic
well-being
or
prosperity.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
health
of
our
citizenry
who
make
up
the
nation.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
general
welfare,
precisely
because
that
was
discussed
in
the
debates
that
took
place.
not
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
would
think
for
example
that
--
and
we
have
an
appendix
to
that
effect.
this,
the
coal
situation
which
is
very
prominently
discussed
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
enacted
and
when
you
have
analyzed
the
statistics
on
health,
which
we
have
done
in
an
appendix
in
our
brief,
you
will
find
that
the
bulk
of
the
coal
production
of
the
country
relates
to
the
physical
health
of
the
united
states,
of
the
citizens
of
our
country.
it
relates
to
heating,
the
light,
and
matters
of
that
character,
the
bulk,
over
50%.
we
have
the
government
figures
which
show
that
the
industrial
part
of
coal
consumption
is
still
a
minority
of
the
coal
consumption
of
the
country.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
said
the
statute
doesn't
reach.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
possibly
is
a
long
word
but
it
doesn't
reach
the
steel
as
we
now
have
it
in
light
of
the
circumstances
that
i
have
put.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
there
would
--
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
i
will
come
to
the
national
--
by
all
means,
we
make
no
argument
that
--
that
national
safety
may
not
be
involved.
we
say
it
isn't
in
this
case
and
that
--
but
we
make
no
argument
that
the
national
safety
may
not
be
involved.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
that
we
--
we
contend
here
that
it
means
the
security
of
the
country.
the
only
possible
meaning
you
can
attach
in
light
of
the
--
of
the
congressional
history.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
it
means
national
--
no
it
means
national
physical
health
which
relates
to
the
citizens
of
our
country.
they
are
the
national
body.
i
do
not
draw
a
distinction
between
them
and
the
country.
they
are
part
of
it.
but
the
key
there,
i
think,
is
physical,
not
national.
i
say
that
on
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute,
they
were
talking
about
physical
health,
not
economic
well-being.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
because
the
individuals
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
is
--
it
is
not
in
light
of
the
congressional
history
because
congress
had
an
opportunity
to
say
that
if
it
wanted
to,
and
turn
that
down
as
i
shall
point
out
in
just
a
second.
the
--
the
history
in
that
area
is
the
--
the
interest
concept
which
was
put
in,
in
the
house
would
--
was
an
all-embracing
term
to
indicate
economics,
to
indicate
the
general
welfare,
to
indicate
the
terms
which
would
be
encompassed,
in
my
opinion
at
least,
in
economic
well-being.
this
is
what
i
think
the
debates
show.
but
the
senate,
under
senator
taft's
leadership,
was
talking
about
something
else.
and
it
was
the
senate
version
which
prevailed,
not
the
house
version.
the
senate
was
talking
in
terms
of
the
situation
in
this
area
where
there,
some
of
the
senators
used
the
word,
“where
there
would
be
a
national
paralysis.”
that
word
frequently
comes
up.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
national
paralysis,
(inaudible),
the
--
the
--
it's
interesting
one
colloquy
which
occurred
in
the
house.
any
large
strike
can
affect
the
economic
well-being
of
the
country.
steelworkers
are
not
the
only
union
that
has
as
many
people
in
it.
the
automobile
workers
have
even
more
people
employed
in
the
basic
automobile
industry.
they
have
some
700,000
employed
in
the
basic
automobile
industry.
and
yet,
congressman
kennedy
who
played
an
active
part
in
the
discussions,
he
was
a
member
of
the
committee,
objected
to
the
word
interest
on
the
specific
basis,
that
it
might
include
a
strike
in
the
automobile
industry.
and
he
said,
“that's
too
broad.
we
don't
intend
to
encompass
that.”
and
yet,
the
history,
recent
history,
demonstrates
that
when
automobiles
aren't
selling,
it
has
as
the
very
profound
effect
upon
the
economic
well-being
of
the
united
states.
we
learned
that
last
year,
when
we
had
an
excess
of
five
and
a
half
million
people
unemployed
primarily
--
not
primarily
but
as
--
as
a
factor
in
the
recession
was
the
said
state
of
the
automobile
industry.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
now
again,
we
go
back
to
senator
taft
to
manage
the
bill.
and
he
dealt
with
the
automobile
situation
as
did
congressman
kennedy.
and
he
went
on
to
say,
the
statement
has
been
made
that
this
amendment,
and
as
--
that
he
was
dealing
now
with
the
language
affecting
the
industry
or
substantial
part
thereof,
would
subject
a
strike
with
the
employees
of
one
automobile
manufacturing
company
to
an
injunction.
he's
probably
thinking
of
general
motors
which
itself
almost
employs
the
same
number
of
people
as
the
total
steel
industry
employees.
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
general
motors
employs
about
300,000
people.
and
this
is
what
taft
--
here
again,
the
speaker
ignored
the
remainder
of
the
paragraph
which
imposes
the
additional
requirement
that
such
strike
imperil
the
national
health
or
safety,
a
condition,
which,
it
is
anticipated,
will
not
often
occur.
now,
the
government
has
advanced
another
theory
here.
it
was
not
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
it
is
in
the
government's
case.
the
government
extends
economic
health
to
include
general
welfare
of
the
country,
the
general
welfare
of
the
country.
they
in
effect
said
that
they
wished
to
revive
debs,
not
in
the
form
in
which
debs
was
decided
in
my
judgment,
but
in
the
form
in
which
debs
was
viewed
in
its
most
outrageous
form.
that
the
government,
by
injunction,
can
use
the
injunction
process
in
the
courts
to
safeguard
the
general
welfare
of
the
country,
and
this
is
what
the
government
in
effect
says
is
the
justification
for
its
position.
there
is
a
fundamentally
wrong
thing
with
that
and
perhaps
two.
one
is,
i
would
have
assumed
that
debs
was
discredited
even
with
the
government?
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
i
say
that
because
of
the
--
what
i
thought
was
the
march
of
events,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
but,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
way
it
was
used
was
within
the
limits
of
the
facts
of
debs.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
i
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
yes
--
i
think
i
should
have
confined
it
and
meant
to
say
the
sweep
of
debs
is
popularly
construed.
the
case
itself
dealt
with
on
--
and
the
facts
dealt
with
violent
action
that
struck
the
mails
in
interstate
transportation.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
it
does
because
it
travels
way
beyond
the
act
and
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
rested
on
the
statute
but
not
the
enactment
part
of
the
statute.
they
turned
from
the
statute
we
have
been
considering,
the
section's
208.
they
turned
to
the
general
statement
of
purposes
in
the
labor
management
relations
act
where
they
say
in
general
that
this
act
is
designed
to
protect
the
public
and
the
general
welfare.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
right.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
seek
to
sustain
it
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
but
not
its
operative
parts.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
in
my
opinion,
that
leaves
them
seeking
to
sustain
it
in
broad
way,
in
a
broad
way.
now
it's
interesting
because
they
contradict
themselves.
the
general
statement
of
purposes
in
the
statute
which
talks
about
general
welfare
because
there
are
a
lot
of
provisions
of
the
taft-hartley
act
not
involved
here
which
bear
on
the
general
welfare.
also,
it
talks
about
public
health.
they
can't
have
their
cake
and
eat
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
read
beyond
that.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
then
that's
the
way
they
--
i
think,
they
attempt
for
an
expanded
version.
now
i'd
like
to
turn
from
--
i
have
not
and
i
would
propose
to
wait
a
moment
to
discuss
with
even
on
the
government's
version
economic
well-being
has
been
so
imperiled
as
to
justify
the
injunction.
even
if
we
were
to
accept
their
version,
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
before
i
do
that
to
the
safety
argument.
now,
i
want
to
say
as
i've
said
in
response
to
your
questions,
of
course,
defense
is
pertinent
to
a
determination
of
the
national
safety.
i
do
not
contest
that.
but
in
any
case,
even
assuming
the
government's
best
case,
any
problem,
or
any
peril,
for
the
national
safety
arises
not
from
these
96
strikes
that
are
taking
place
in
totality,
but
from
a
shutdown
of
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
steel
industry.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
it
may.
i
challenge
that
on
the
evidence
but
for
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
for
--
it
doesn't
but
for
the
moment
i'm
assuming
that
the
government
has
made
that
case.
later
i
shall
challenge
it
as
i
challenged
economic
health,
even
if
you'll
assume
their
case.
but
now
i
say
assuming
their
case
is
firmed.
now
i
say
that
under
the
taft-hartley
act
a
shutdown
does
not
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
district
court
to
enjoin
a
strike
in
the
entire
industry
because
a
small
fraction
of
the
industry
is
required
for
the
national
safety.
now
any
view
of
this
would
necessitate
their
conclusion
that
if,
let
us
say,
taking
them
out
of
the
(inaudible),
5000
employees
in
three
plants
were
involved
in
processes
vital
to
national
defense
that
the
injunction
could
break
the
strike
as
to
500,000.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
but
later,
i
shall
have
something
to
say
about
that
relationship.
now
i
go
back
to
some
of
the
background
figures
i
gave
you.
i
said
that
originally
23
million
tons
of
steel
were
being
produced
by
non-struck
companies.
this
has
been
added
to
now
by
kaiser
two,
two,
a
little
over
two,
on
23
million.
so
that's
25
million.
what
are
the
defense
needs
in
terms
of
steel
of
the
united
states
as
demonstrated
here
by
uncontroverted
evidence
in
the
affidavits?
less
than
1%
of
the
total
steel
produced
in
united
states.
in
terms
of
finished
steel,
as
contrasted
with
our
capacity
of
147
million
tons,
as
contrasted
with
production
now
going
on
of
25
million
tons,
as
contrasted
with
the
production
of
the
first
six
months
much
of
which
went
into
inventory.
as
contrasted
with
steel
which
is
coming
in
from
abroad.
as
my
friends
in
the
industry
say
it's
overwhelming
us,
which
we
have
denied,
but
taking
all
these
together,
all
of
this
of
all
types
for
defense
use
have
never
exceeded
in
their
past
couple
of
years
and
they've
fallen
below
700,000
tons
of
steel.
now
we
go
on
to
this.
steel,
as
your
honors
probably
know,
is
generally
of
two
or
three
basic
types.
we
must
--
we
must
give
the
government
all
that
it
has
to
say
in
this
area
in
all
fairness.
steel
consists
of
various
types.
the
great
bulk
of
steel
production
in
the
united
states
is
carbon
steel.
this
is
produced
in
generally
in
open
hearth
furnaces.
it's
carbon
steel.
the
open
hearths
also
produce
some
low-alloy
steels.
in
fact
in
the
ore,
they
produce
quite
a
bit
of
it.
the
specialty
steels,
this
is
what
appears
in
the
government
affidavits
is
there
a
need
and
claim,
the
specialty
steels.
these
are
high-alloy
steels
are
made
in
the
industry
of
what
is
called
--
what
are
called
electric
furnaces.
now
we
have
been
trying
throughout
these
proceedings,
we've
criticized
the
government's
affidavits.
it's
not
telling
us
what
plants,
where,
how,
what
type
of
steel,
other
than
the
general
statement
specialized
steel.
and
so
we
have
been
forced
to
make
our
own
analysis
from
public
resources.
and
if
you
will
look
at
our
brief,
you
will
find
an
appendix
from
sources
of
which
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice.
and
you
will
find
in
this
appendix
page,
starting
at
appendix
f,
the
availability
of
special
steel
is
needed
from
military
aircraft
and
missile
purposes.
and
if
you
look
at
table
1
on
page
87,
you'll
find
that
the
companies
not
on
strike,
while
they
represent
now
17%
of
the
steel
capacity,
there
are
in
many
areas
the
electric
furnace
producers
of
the
country.
and
they
have
35%
of
the
total
electric
furnace
capacity
of
the
nation.
now
just
the
other
day,
i
believe
it
was
october
the
26th,
there
was
a
publication
which
we
have
filed
with
the
court
which
lists
defense
orders
and
we
have
made
an
analysis
of
that
and
we
find
that
in
virtually
every
instance,
the
type
of
steel
required
is
being
made
by
the
companies
not
on
strike,
or
they
are
capable
of
making.
this
is
a
document
published
by
the
industry.
and
i
might
say
to
your
honors
for
your
own
information,
we
ask
the
--
the
defense
department
and
the
persons
in
charge
for
a
statement
of
what
companies
were
involved,
and
i
will
later,
on
the
discretion
argument,
make
an
argument
about
that,
about
our
desire
to
cooperate
to
produce
this
material.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
and
are
capable,
both.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
know,
don't
want
to
say
why.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
it
is
a
fact
but
that
--
the
why
is
relevant.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
we
--
through
cross-examination.
however,
it
is
my
view,
this
came
up
on
final
hearing,
it
is
not
our
burden
to
prove
that
there
is
a
threat
to
the
national
health
or
safety.
it's
the
government's
burden.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now
if
you
look
at
that
and
one
of
the
government
claims
that
were
made
in
one
of
their
affidavits
is
that
one
particular
type
of
specialty
steel,
vacuum
process
steel
is
particularly
in
need.
this
publication
demonstrates
that
20
of
the
23
companies
making
this
particular
type
of
steel
are
not
on
strike,
20
of
the
23.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
i
was
just
saying,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
attempted
to
find
out
without
success,
although
--
although
i
must
say
this,
and
this
illustrates
this
corporate
secrecy
that's
put
on
this.
the
metal
magazine
which
is
an
industry
magazine
illuminates
us
very
largely
on
this
subject.
it
goes
into
a
great
detail;
it
doesn't
tell
us
purportedly,
but
it
goes
into
great
detail
of
these
things,
telling
that
the
constituency,
the
type
of
steel,
the
place,
the
project
for
which
it
is
designed
or
when
the
union
desiring
to
cooperate
with
its
government
request
the
information,
this
information
is
denied
to
the
union.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
there
was
nothing.
and
then
--
and
there
are
no
--
there
are
no
affidavits
where
security
considerations
are
involved.
but
later
on,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'm
going
to
talk
to
that
subject
on
--
on
evidence.
now
i
say
that
where
the
record
does
show
without
contradiction
that
a
minute
amount
of
steel
is
required,
particularly
specialty
steel,
a
minute
part,
government
can
make
no
claim
that
carbon
steel
is
not
available,
because
this
22
million
tons
is
--
is
in
large
part
carbon
steel
whereupon
specialty
steel,
all
the
government
requires
of
specialty
steel,
is
required
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it's
high-alloy
steel.
it
is
hard.
it
is
made
in
electric
furnaces.
it
has
properties
that
cover
missiles
and
ammunition
and
other
ordinance.
whereupon
the
minute
section
is
involved,
it
is,
at
least
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute,
now
we
turn
to
the
statute,
doesn't
permit
an
injunction
to
be
issued
against
the
strike
in
a
small
part
of
the
industry,
even
though
that
strike
imperil
the
national
safety.
this
is
the
key
question.
i'd
like
to
repeat
it.
the
statute
says,
there
are
two
elements
in
the
statute,
one
that
the
threatened
or
actual
strike
affects
an
entire
industry
or
substantial
part
thereof;
two,
if
permitted
to
occur
or
continue
will
imperil
the
national
health
or
safety.
and
i
put
you
a
simple
case.
suppose
that
in
the
steel
industry,
there
is
one
company
employing
5000
people
that
produces
items
and
it's
in
the
steel
industry.
it's
a
steel
company.
it
produces
an
alloy
steel
required
for
national
defense.
this
statute
does
not
permit
an
injunction
to
be
issued
to
put
that
plant
at
work
under
the
injunction
process.
i
want
to
make
that
as
emphatic
as
i
can.
to
do
that,
it
would
be
to
misread
the
statute.
this
is
not
what
the
congressional
favors
of
the
statute
meant.
they
were
talking
in
terms
of
the
industry
or
substantial
part
of
the
industry,
strike
there
imperiling
the
health
or
safety
of
the
country.
now
i
want
to
add
something
very
hastily.
is
our
country
defenses
under
this
situation?
it's
a
legitimate
concern
to
all
of
us,
although
it
might
be
a
--
it's
probably
a
congressional
concern.
but
congress
has
acted.
congress
has
acted
in
this
area
not
by
injunction,
but
just
a
fatal
fallacy
of
the
government's
case.
congress
has
at
least
three
statutes
which
bear
on
this
subject.
one
is
the
selective
service
act
of
1948
as
your
honors
had
occasion
to
consider
in
the
steel
seizure
case
in
1952.
now
in
the
several
opinions
of
the
steel
seizure
case,
mr.
justice
clark,
you
talked
about
it
at
some
length.
mr.
justice
jackson
talked
about
it.
the
selective
service
act
says
specifically
that
if
there
is
a
commodity
and
it
refers
specifically
to
steel
at
one
stage,
necessary
for
the
defense
of
our
country,
and
if
the
employer
refuses
or
fails
to
produce
it,
then
the
government
may
seize
that
instrumentality.
and
that's
a
statutory
seizure.
that
is
not
the
seizure
under
the
alleged
implied
powers
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
the
youngstown
versus
sawyer.
now
the
government
has
the
means
if
an
employer
is
disabled
because
of
the
strike,
to
seize
that
plant
and
put
it
back
into
production.
there
are
other
statutes
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
the
government
--
government
may
place
an
order
anytime,
and
your
footnote
in
the
youngstown
versus
sawyer
demonstrates
that
that
was
done
on
occasion.
order
was
placed
within
24
hours.
the
next
statute
which
is
available,
government
has
three
--
three
vehicles.
there's
the
defense
production
act
of
1950.
the
defense
production
act
of
1950
authorizes
two
procedures.
one
is
that
it
permits
the
government
if
needed
for
defense
purposes
to
establish
priorities,
to
allocate,
to
require
the
production
of
defense
items.
now
it's
interesting
to
see
in
reference
to
the
government's
concept
that
you'd
have
to
act
in
the
way
it
acted
here
by
enjoining
a
nationwide
strike
and
disputes
between
many
companies
by
injunction
order.
it's
interesting
to
see
what
the
government
did
with
its
powers
under
that
statute.
the
government
for
the
first
month
of
the
strike
did
nothing
under
the
defense
production
act
except
send
a
letter
or
issue
an
order
advising
all
companies
not
struck
to
keep
the
government
advised
as
to
what
they
were
doing.
that's
all
they
did
there
for
the
first
period.
they
didn't
do
anything
further
until
october
the
16th
after
the
board
of
inquiry
had
acted,
after
i
made
an
argument
before
the
board
of
inquiry
on
this
subject
pointing
to
the
defense
production
act.
and
on
october
16th,
they
finally
issued
an
order.
and
the
order
is
primarily
designed
to
assure,
as
the
government
says
frankly
in
its
brief
that
when
the
struck
plants
go
back
into
operation,
that
defense
orders
will
have
priority.
that's
not
the
primary
design
of
that
order.
now
let's
contrast
this
with
the
action
of
the
government
which
we
have
an
affidavit
on,
in
the
1956
strike.
in
1956,
we
had
a
strike
in
1956,
the
20th
day
of
that
strike,
not
the
90th
day,
the
government
issued
a
freeze
order
on
steel
in
the
non-struck
plants.
so
that
specialty,
and
these
were
all
specialty
steels,
so
that
they
would
have
access
to
that
steel
and
could
allocate
it
anywhere
that
they
wanted
to
for
processing
by
contractors
of
the
government.
now
finally
on
this
subject,
there's
another
provision,
and
that
is
this,
under
the
defense
production
act,
the
government
may
--
the
president
may
solicit
the
voluntary
agreement
of
labor
and
management
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
we
have
an
affidavit
on
our
reply
which
is
uncontradicted.
but
where
the
government
solicited
the
--
the
cooperation
of
the
steelworkers
union
to
move
goods
out
of
struck
plants
that
cooperation
has
been
forthcoming.
now
we
have
letters
from
--
a
letter
from
the
admiral
in
charge
for
procurement
of
the
navy
certifying
that
this
is
so.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
my
argument
is
not
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
later
i
shall
talk
about
discretion.
my
argument
at
this
point
was
merely
to
reassure
all
of
us
that
the
government
is
not
powerless
in
a
situation
where
the
national
emergency
provisions
of
taft-hartley
don't
authorize
an
injunction
against
a
strike
in
a
few
plants
making
up
a
part
of
the
industry.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
but
national
safety
in
a
few
plants.
i
was
just
saying
your
honors
that
as
a
citizen,
that
at
this
point,
clearly
congress
might
now
have
provided
for
that
and
that
wouldn't
have
helped
anyhow.
what
i
was
saying
that
we
can
be
reassured
there
are
methods
to
do.
later
i
will
talk
about
discretion.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
just
think
they
are
a
remedy
by
law
and
they
can
enter
into
the
exercise
of
equitable
discretion
by
the
judge.
if
i'm
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i'd
say
that
judge
can
weigh
properly
should
weigh
and
if
i'm
wrong
in
my
argument
that
the
emergency
sections
do
not
reach
a
few
plants
for
a
constituting
part
of
a
whole
industry
which
are
necessary
for
the
national
safety,
i
say
it
is
relevant
for
a
judge
to
consider
other
available
means
short
--
very
limited
means
involving
relatively
few
people
and
companies
rather
than
terminating
a
strike
of
500,000
people.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
i
just
--
as
i
said,
i
said
this
as
a
citizen
and
later
however,
it
becomes
relevant
on
discretion.
now
i
--
i
said
that
i
would
address
myself
--
so
far
i've
given
you
our
version
of
the
evidence,
which
i
think
is
going
out
on
a
fair
reading
of
the
evidence.
let's
take
the
government's
reading
of
the
evidence
and
the
government's
theory.
assume
now
that
i'm
wrong.
that
national
health
or
safety
and
health
in
the
--
encompasses
the
economic
well-being
of
the
united
states.
and
let's
assume
that
safety
encompasses
--
the
safety
encompasses
their
requirement,
they
need
some
steel
from
--
from
certain
plants.
let's
make
both
of
those
assumptions.
now
take
the
economic
health
of
the
country.
this
is
the
subject
of
the
plaintiff.
what
do
we
have?
we
have
affidavits
and
we
can
take
public
notice
of
facts.
the
facts
are
that
at
the
present
moment
there
are
about
three
million
people
unemployed.
500,000
are
steel
workers
250,000
at
the
time
of
the
filing
a
suit,
are
workers
unemployed
so
it
appears
from
the
record
because
of
the
shutdown
in
steel.
now
the
judge,
looking
to
the
future
based
upon
one
of
these
affidavits,
says
that
in
the
findings,
by
the
end
of
the
year,
it
has
to
be
served,
because
we'd
hope
the
strike
will
be
settled
before
that.
but
he
says
by
the
end
of
the
year,
the
unemployment
including
unemployed
steel
workers
may
arise
to
two
million
or
thereabouts,
that's
two
million
and
a
quarter.
we'd
have
unemployed
by
this
thesis
of
five
million
and
a
quarter.
and
in
addition,
we
have
some
economic
reports
made
by
one
of
the
government's
own
witnesses,
the
government
document
which
i
want
to
advert
to.
in
the
last
year,
we
had
unemployed
of
five
and
a
half
million,
more
than
that,
and
it
was
not
asserted
that
the
national
health
or
safety
was
in
peril
--
imperiled.
we
don't
like
unemployment.
we've
been
very
articulated
in
the
labor
movement
about
unemployment.
but
it
is
a
far
cry
for
the
government
to
argue
that
this
state
of
unemployment
imperils
the
national
health
of
the
country.
but
we
have
some
more
significant
theory
other
than
these
releases
we
seem
to
be
getting
currently
everyday
in
the
newspaper.
the
counsel
and
economic
advisers,
the
chairman
is
a
witness
here,
has
just
the
other
day
issued
his
economic
forecast
and
report.
and
what
did
he
say?
the
country
is
booming
at
a
great
rate.
it
is
1%
less
than
our
top
gross
national
product
in
our
top
production
right
now,
right
now
as
we
sit
here
today.
it
has
declined
due
to
the
steel
strike.
i
don't
dispute
that,
but
it
is
far
in
excess
of
what
the
situation
was
in
--
in
1958.
now
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
very
good
baseline,
but
i
will
say
that
the
country
wasn't
paralyzed.
there
was
hardship,
there
was
difficulty,
but
it
scarcely
quickly
describes
at
least
so
the
government
felt
at
that
time
as
a
state
of
economic
paralysis
for
the
country.
now
on
that
record,
i
believe
that
the
government
has
not
sustained
its
burden.
and
again
i
emphasize
the
burden,
the
case
was
tried,
on
final
trial,
this
was
not
a
preliminary
order.
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
prove
by
clear
and
preponderating
evidence
that
national
health
or
safety
was
involved.
and
on
the
safety
factor,
we
have,
let's
get
back
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
the
affidavit.
we
have
scanned
the
affidavit
for
the
government.
it
is
truly
tried
within
affidavits.
and
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
that.
we
have
no
choice.
if
we
had
proceeded
otherwise,
then
on
affidavits,
the
government
would
have
obtained
the
preliminary
--
and
the
record
of
taft-hartley
injunction
showed
this.
this
has
nothing
like
“aren't
you
out
of
your
mind?”
and
in
a
case
in
which
i
participated
shows
this.
government
would
have
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
if
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
no.
i
can't
tell
what
the
individual
judge
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
can
only
--
i
can
only
act
on
the
history
and
experience
that
confronts
a
litigant
and
a
counsel
in
this
type
of
proceeding
and
something
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
the
history
of
injunction
which
is
relevant.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
know
that.
but
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
a
significant
government
statement
in
its
brief
as
to
the
course
of
conduct
which
they
anticipated,
i'm
not
the
only
one
anticipating.
the
government
says
this.
government
says
that
if
my
theory
is
right,
that
a
judge
could
look
into
selective
reopening.
obviously,
the
only
indicated
course
of
procedure
under
this
statute,
obviously,
the
only
indicated
course
of
procedure
would
be
to
restrain
the
strike
and
then
hold
hearing.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
that's
true
your
--
that's
true
your
honor.
but
the
indicated
course
of
procedure
would
have
been
then
to
conduct
a
fact
of
inquiry
with
respect
to
this
manner
to
determine
what
steel
was
required
for
what.
but
we
--
we
tried
once
in
the
taft-hartley
area
to
get
an
adjudication
from
a
temporary
order
and
it's
in
the
record
here,
the
american
locomotive
case
where
we
tried
in
the
normal
procedures
of
the
courts
to
get
a
review,
and
we
appealed
a
temporary
order
at
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit.
we
knocked
down
the
door
of
this
court
and
we
were
denied.
we
appealed
to
the
second
circuit
and
we
got
an
order
affirming
the
order
of
the
court
below
on
the
79th
day,
where
the
case
mooted
the
next
day
and
we
could
not
get
the
review.
now
--
i
would
now
like
to
move
on
and
move
to
the
next
foundation
of
my
argument.
and
that
is
this.
that
even
if
the
government
has
met
the
burden
of
proof,
as
the
jurisdictional
requisites
of
section
208
were
satisfied,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed,
first
because
the
district
court
completely
failed
to
consider
the
equities
before
issuing
its
order,
and
thus
failed
to
perform
an
essential
part
of
its
function;
second,
the
court
of
appeals
there
in
sustaining
the
district
court
on
the
basis
that
the
court's
exercise
of
discretion
which
had
been
exercised
was
inappropriate
exercise
of
its
discretion.
and
third,
that
the
balancing
of
the
equity,
if
i'm
wrong
about
the
what
we
might
call
the
selective
reopening,
that
the
balance
of
the
equities
in
this
case,
would
have
justified
withholding
of
an
injunction
or
at
most
an
injunction
limited
to
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
several
struck
plants
which
might
be
required
to
satisfy
shortages
to
safety
purposes.
and
for
health
purposes
for
that
matter,
that
health
could
be
sustained.
now
i
turn
again
to
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
although
i'm
not
at
the
mood
but
it
could
be
done
in
the
steel,
mr.
justice
stewart.
steel
plants
if
i
may
explain
it
are
--
are
of
varying
types.
the
--
you
have
integrated
plants
you
have
non
integrated
plants.
an
integrated
plant
is
a
plant
which
starts
with
a
blast
furnace
and
takes
iron
ore
and
melts
it.
it
proceeds
to
an
open
hearth
which
makes
steel
and
then
proceeds
them
to
roll
--
to
roll
steel
in
different
forms
and
to
--
and
to
fabricate.
now
in
all
the
industry,
the
various
parts
in
the
plant
sometimes
are
activated
without
the
other
parts.
the
firm
may
not
have
enough
furnace
capacity
and
they
use
its
rolling
capacity
by
getting
ingots
from
other
plants
and
this
is
possible.
but
at
the
moment
i
say
that
this
could
be
done
by
putting
a
whole
plant
back
if
necessary.
now
the
first
thing
we
look
at
is
the
statute
again.
and
the
statute
talks
in
terms
of
jurisdiction.
it
doesn't
mandate
the
district
judge
to
issue
the
injunction.
it
does
not
say,
“shall
enjoin”.
it
says
that
the
district
judge
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin.
and
that's
a
vital
distinction,
because
it
gives
him
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
of
equity
free
from
the
limitations
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
but
to
a
limited
extent
prescribed
in
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
has
discretion.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
--
the
--
what
i
find
--
i
read
it
from
the
statute
itself.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it's
the
best
to
read
it.
and
then
i
read
it
also
from
the
government,
which
i
will
come
to
it
in
a
moment
in
a
very
significant
application
of
that
principle.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
find.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
find
why
it
didn't
say.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
stand
on
the
statute.
on
the
plain
words
itself.
now
it
is
apparent
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
--
i
would
think
so.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
pardon?
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
have
support
from
the
fact
that
when
you
give
a
court
of
equity
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
equity
must
act
like
a
court
of
equity.
in
hecht
versus
bowles,
your
own
decision
in
this
area
indicates
that
when
a
court
of
equity
acts,
it
should
act
like
a
court
of
equity.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
interestingly
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
feel
that
the
right
to
issue
an
order
was
not
linked
to
the
injunction.
they
read
at
the
end
in
effect
(voice
overlap)
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
this
i'm
in
agreement.
now
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
now
the
--
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
the
general
expression
of
a
--
a
doctrine
as
to
the
court
of
equity,
i
think
your
honor
is
right
on
--
on
the
facts
but
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
argued.
now
when
you
read
this
jurisdiction
in
a
court
of
equity
for
a
limited
purpose,
you
then
mandate
the
court
without
a
plain
statute
mandate.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
the
district
judge
did
not
feel
he
had
any
discretion.
we
tendered
a
finding
on
discretion.
it
was
turned
down.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
have
a
supposed
finding
which
is
in
the
record
on
page
214
of
the
record.
but
i
don't
recall
a
colloquy
on
this
point.
215
is
the
actual
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
i
supposed,
and
that
was
denied
by
the
judge.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no
he
just
said
denied.
now
the
interesting
thing
is
that
the
government
--
the
government
--
i
don't
know
where
the
government
stands
on
this
issue.
the
--
in
the
district
court,
the
government
i
think
assumed
there
was
no
discretion.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
government
counsel
said
there
was
no
discretion
and
then
under
heavy
questioning
by
the
court,
i
believe
i
quote
him
correctly,
said,
maybe
they
can
squeeze
something
out.
in
the
briefs
that
the
government
has
filed,
was
at
a
loss
on
this
subject,
but
the
government
was
not
so
much
at
a
loss
when
it
argued
the
other
case
i
have
in
the
--
in
the
--
the
american
locomotive
case.
they
filed
a
brief
in
the
american
locomotive
case
which
involved
this
section
in
the
second
circuit.
and
here
they
--
they
touched
our
case
here.
now
i
read
from
their
brief.
“the
power
under
the
present
act
to
exercise
discretion
in
granting
or
withholding
an
injunction
means
no
more
that
in
each
case,
the
court
must
fall
into
the
equity.
for
example,
it
is
conceivable
that
a
case
may
occur
which
all
go
within
the
statute
and
arouse
relatively
slight
danger
to
the
public
safety
and
a
prospect
of
severe
injury
to
the
economic
interest
of
the
strikers.
in
such
a
case,
the
court
might
refuse
an
injunction.
now
i
say
that
the
government's
statement
in
american
locomotive
upon
ruling
in
all
the
other
issues,
that's
the
case
implied.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
are
three
considerations.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
right.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
three
considerations
that
i
see
are
these.
no
injunction
was
warranted
and
he
could
have
exercised
his
discretion,
because
an
issuance
of
an
injunction
would
prevent
a
settlement
which
would
be
expeditiously
achieved
in
the
absence
of
this.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
this
--
i
think
the
history
reported
by
the
mediation
service
and
government
documents,
mr.
ching,
when
he
was
the
director
of
mediation
said
that
is
the
basis
of
their
extent.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
if
you
can't
tell
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
we
filed
on
a
state
of
the
record
that
we
are
to
accept
opinion
evidence
from
the
government
as
to
the
state
of
its
national
safety
we
have
the
only
affidavit
on
record,
on
this
subject.
the
government
has
none.
and
we
have
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
he
did.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
we
have
the
opinion
of
the
government
witnesses
that
if
we
don't
resume
still,
it
will
encourage
small
wars.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
oh,
but
we
--
this
isn't
all
we
have
here
either.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
--
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
have
a
settlement
two
days
after
this.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
but
a
substantial
one.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
oh,
yes.
i
am
here
very
much
because
the
strike
is
on.
but
the
interesting
thing
is
that
the
government
itself
throughout
speculations
in
the
future,
they
have
a
speculation
of
finding
of
a
fact,
the
strike
is
going
to
continue
in
the
indefinite
future.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
i
will
come
to
this
speculation.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
i
will
come
to
this
speculation.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
i
will
come
to
a
--
a
point
in
my
argument
where
i
think
all
the
speculation
is
non-judiciary.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
can
imagine
something
more
for
the
reasons
that
i'm
going
to
give
you,
when
you
are
asking
judges
to
speculate
on
our
foreign
policy,
national
defense,
economic
health
of
the
country
and
many
other
considerations.
but
i
would
like
to
reach
that
a
little
later
in
the
argument.
now,
the
second
element
of
discretion
is
that
the
injunction
should
be
denied
because
statutory
remedies
are
available
and
less
drastic
than
the
equitable
remedy
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
facts
demonstrate
that.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
not
see
all
of
the
steel
mills.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
all
of
the
steel
mills.
but
i
think
it
quite
apparent
that
if
as
i
think
this
record
plainly
indicates
that
a
small
member
of
the
steel
mills
could
be
involved
if
that's
far
less
drastic
and
a
chance
for
balancing
the
equity
which
is
his
responsibility
can
properly
use
that
in
his
discretion.
and
this
seems
to
me,
these
are
the
elements,
it
seems
to
me
that
entered,
these
three
elements
that
entered
into
this
area.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
you
don't'
have
to
go
that
far
here.
we
have
a
court
that
did
not
exercise
any
discretion
and
we
have
a
right
to
have
the
court
exercise
this
discretion,
(inaudible),
we
have
a
court
which
did
not
exercise
any
discretion
as
the
record
plainly
shows.
now
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
last
leg
of
the
argument,
the
constitutional
argument.
it's
our
position
that
the
80-day
injunction
provisions
are
unconstitutional
as
they
confer
on
the
court's
duties
which
are
not
judicial
and
are
not
connected
with
any
case
that
comes.
and
here
i
raise
what
i
believe
to
be
a
very
serious
fundamental
question
which
the
court
has
not
reached
has
not
properly
reached
with
the
case
is
decided
under
other
facets
of
my
argument,
but
is
reached
if
the
other
facets
of
my
argument
are
held
against
me.
the
--
i
don't
have
to
deliver
the
point
that
this
court
and
federal
courts
are
to
engage
in
a
judicial
function,
and
their
judicial
function
is
adjudicating
justiciable
controversies.
and
it
is
my
position
that
this
statute
that
bears
upon
the
court
not
judicial
function
but
makes
the
court
part
of
an
administrative
process
to
settle
strikes.
and
this
is
not
the
function
of
the
federal
courts,
the
constitutional
courts.
now
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
to
leave
the
congressional
history
here
on
any
fair
reading
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
courts
to
adjudicate
any
rights
or
compel
the
performance
of
any
duties
but
the
act
is
part
of
the
machinery
that
they
were
creating
to
define
and
settle
the
labor
dispute.
and
here
the
government
--
and
we
clash
directly.
we
say
that
congress
did
not
create
a
substantive
right
of
the
united
states
and
the
public
to
be
free
from
a
work
stoppage
affecting
the
national
health
and
safety,
and
providing
a
judicial
remedy
to
comply
with
its
duties
to
end
such
a
stoppage.
now
there
are
provisions
in
the
taft-hartley
act
which
define
cooling
off
period.
this
is
popularly
called
the
cooling
off
period.
in
8
(d)
of
the
statute,
there
are
two.
we
have
got
to
give
the
mediation
service
30
days
notice.
we
got
to
give
the
parties
60
days
notice
before
we
can
strike.
and
it
would
be
unlawful,
the
parties
have
recourse
against
them
in
the
event,
we
did
not
comply
with
those
provisions.
now
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
enacted
those
provisions.
but
here,
what
congress
did
was
faced
with
an
unpopular
decision.
the
question
of
legislation
whether
the
solution
to
a
national
emergency
dispute
is
to
make
it
an
obligation
on
the
union
alone
not
to
strike,
or
to
do
something
about
the
substantive
issue
that
might
be
more
equitable
to
both
sides.
congress
did
not
decide
that
point.
it
was
within
the
competence
of
the
congress
to
decide.
it
was
the
duty
of
the
congress
to
decide,
but
on
the
popular
parlance,
they
passed
the
buck
to
the
supreme
court
to
break
the
strike.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
we
have.
but
--
but
barely
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
i
will.
i
will
say
the
same
thing
for
my
friends
on
the
other
side.
now
this
is
what
precisely
happened
here.
now
let
me
demonstrate
by
again
recourse
to
the
cases
that
there
is
no
conceivable
way
if
there
was
a
duty
of
my
distinguished
friend,
the
solicitor
general
says
can
be
applied
from
the
statute,
the
jurisdiction
of
grant.
and
there
are
cases
where
jurisdictional
grant
implies
duty
that
has
been
decided
by
this
court,
but
there
is
no
way
we
can
comply
with
our
duty
which
the
government
assert
exists.
no
way,
and
i
will
again
refer
to
my
prior
experience
in
the
american
locomotive.
there
was
a
strike
which
threatened
to
imperil
the
national
safety.
for
280
days,
the
union
voluntarily
complied
with
request
from
the
president
to
postpone
that
strike,
280
days.
at
the
end
of
the
period,
we
were
enjoined.
we
were
enjoined.
we
have
no
way
of
complying
at
all
with
this
alleged
duty
which
is
owing.
now
if
congress
had
intended
to
make
the
decision,
it
could
have
done
it
very
simple.
it
could
have
said
that
as
there
is
in
the
railway
labor
act,
as
there
was
in
the
thomas
luzinski
bill
offered
in
1959,
that
after
a
finding
at
49,
that
after
a
finding
by
the
president
or
some
competent
body,
that
after
a
declaration
by
the
president,
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
union
or
the
company
as
the
case
maybe
to
remain
at
work,
and
then
of
course
the
courts
could
have
adjudicated
whether
or
not
the
union
complied
with
that
duty.
but
here,
here
there
is
one
thing
done
and
that
is
this
that
--
that
the
injunction
for
the
first
time
which
creates
the
obligation.
now
this
court
many
times,
has
said
that
on
constitutional
issues,
you
must
exercise
caution,
give
deference
to
the
acts
of
congress,
but
the
one
area
where
this
court
has
been
most
vigilant
to
scrutinize
the
acts
of
congress
is
this
area
where
the
judicial
power
is
involved.
and
this
stands
both
from
article
iii
and
from
the
great
concept
of
separation
of
powers
upon
which
our
government
depends.
now
we
ought
not
to
assume,
we
ought
not
to
assume
duties
here
that
can't
be
complied.
we
cannot
imply
duties
that
cannot
be
complied.
we
ought
not
to
test
with
the
courts
the
functions
which
properly
belong
to
the
legislature
or
the
executive.
and
this
is
what
this
statute
does
on
any
plain
reading
of
its
terms
and
it
cannot
be
read
otherwise.
it
is
the
injunction
which
for
the
first
time
will
create
a
duty.
it
is
interesting.
and
when
i
queried
the
distinguished
assistant
attorney
general
in
our
trial
in
the
district
court,
and
i
asked
him,
“is
it
your
contention
that
the
steelworkers
union
has
violated
any
duty
owing
to
anybody?”
the
answer
of
the
assistant
attorney
general
was
very
plain.
it's
in
the
record
too.
and
i
agree
with
him,
it's
158
of
the
record
that
this
union
has
not
violated
or
been
remiss
in
any
legal
duty.
now
there
--
this
court
has
--
has
considered
this
problem
in
many
areas,
government
cites
good
many
cases.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
these
cases.
i
find
that
i
am
only
troubled
really
by
one.
generally,
cases
cited
by
the
government
are
cases
were
first
the
brinson
case
where
the
courts
held
that
a
--
there
was
a
duty
under
the
law
for
witnesses
to
respond
to
a
spree
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that's
a
judicial
function
based
upon
a
prescribed
duty.
government
cites
douds,
the
labor
board
case.
but
there
the
statute
defined
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
court
has
a
right
and
the
court
so
held,
not
this
court
but
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
court
could
enter
an
order,
a
preliminary
order,
enjoining
the
unfair
labor
practice.
but
that
was
prescribed
by
statute
and
there
was
a
duty,
a
duty
that
you
could
have
avoided
that
by
not
committing
the
unfair
labor
practice.
government
cites
a
case
of
eminent
domain
that
all
common
law
lawyers
know
that
eminent
domain
was
a
common
law
right,
well
recognized
in
the
law.
frankly
your
honors,
i
am
troubled
by
one
case
in
this
area,
and
that's
the
tudor
case,
a
naturalization
case.
and
i
could
make
an
argument
in
this
court
on
tudor
saying
that
the
statute
sets
forth
some
duties,
which
a
person
desiring
naturalization
must
comply
with.
but
frankly
as
i
read
judge
brandeis's
decision
in
that,
mr.
justice
brandeis's
decision
in
that
case,
i
come
to
the
conclusion
in
my
own
mind
that
that
case
is
a
sport,
derived
from
the
fact
that
this
function
has
been
performed
by
the
federal
courts
in
1795.
and
when
you
have
a
case
of
that
character,
special
in
character,
i
don't
think
that
that
case
ought
to
be
extended
to
open
the
federal
courts
to
functions
which
the
federal
courts
should
not,
under
the
constitution,
perform.
and
i
--
this
leads
me
to
a
final
observation
of
the
statute.
and
this
has
to
do
with
matter
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
you
queried
me
about
and
said
i
would
cover
in
detail
later.
what
is
the
judicial
function
involved
in
making
the
determinations
which
has
to
be
made
in
this
case
if
an
injunction
is
to
issue?
and
on
this
record
these
are
the
determinations
which
a
court
of
equity
is
required
to
make.
it
will
weaken
our
position
in
the
cold
war.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
function
for
congress
and
the
president.
but
you're
required
to
make
that.
this
was
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
government
advances,
which
the
court
finds.
we
will
be
in
a
bad
way
with
our
allies
in
the
nato
alliance,
that
some
undefined
time
in
the
future
we'll
have
so
much
unemployment
that
it
will
imperil
the
country.
these
are
findings
that
this
court
is
supposed
to
make.
it's
interesting
to
me
that
when
we
get
into
the
question
of
whether
we
will
jeopardize
our
relations
with
our
allies
and
imperil
--
imperil
the
--
our
alliances,
the
one
who
makes
that
affidavit
is
not
our
secretary
of
state
but
the
chairman
of
the
council
of
economic
advisers,
what
his
confidence
in
this
--
in
this
area,
i'm
at
a
loss
to
understand.
and
then,
you
are
asked,
and
the
district
court
is
asked
to
make
in
an
assessment
of
our
defense
situation
in
light
of
the
steel
structure.
is
our
defense
program
going
to
be
delayed?
is
that
an
assessment
for
this
court
to
make
or
the
district
court,
even
assuming
that
we
cross-examine
witnesses?
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
and
this
is
in
further
answer
to
the
affidavit
question.
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
had
we
pressed
that
point,
we
would
have
been
met
with
an
argument
of
classified
information.
that
isn't
a
speculation.
i
was
met
with
it
in
the
american
locomotive
case.
it
seems
to
me
these
are
not
determinations
for
a
court.
these
are
determinations
that
are
properly
made
by
a
chief
executive
or
by
a
congress
or
at
most
by
an
administrative
agency.
and
the
government
it
seems
to
me
concedes
much
when
trying
to
justify
this
type
of
procedure
that
says,
but
look
at
the
labor
board
and
the
sec
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they
all
do
this
type
of
thing.
well
i‘d
say
to
my
distinguished
friends,
those
are
not
courts.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
they
have
exceeded
the
law.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
they
proceed
and
the
congress
empowers
them
to
proceed
as
an
administrative
agency.
congress
did
not.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
that's
what
it
goes
before
courts,
your
determination
is
whether
or
not
they
have
exceeded
the
legal
rules
applicable
to
administrative
agency.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
i
have
to
--
i
have
to
make
the
argument.
i
could
not
start
out
with
a
constitutional
argument.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
but
only
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
--
i
--
i
see
a
great
deal
of
difference
because
congress
described
a
method
of
procedure,
finding,
challenge
the
findings.
here
we
do
not
have
any
of
that.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
we
have
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
we
have
no
findings
by
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
have
the
expression
of
opinion
for
which
i
have
due
deference
but
that
does
not
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
does
not
substitute
for
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
but
--
but
the
congress
wanted
to
act
on
that,
that
it
is
not
natural
to
assume
that
they
would
have
said
return
to
work
when
the
president
expresses
that
opinion.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
wanted
the
court
to
issue
the
injunction
which
is
different
in
our
opinion.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now
i
would
finally
say
this.
and
that
is
that
in
our
opinion,
the
statute
has
not
been
complied
with.
in
our
opinion,
the
government
has
not
met
the
standard
of
proof
required
of
it.
in
our
opinion,
no
union
ought
to
be
compelled
to
terminate
the
strike
which
for
80
days
amounts
in
the
equivalent
to
almost
a
permanent
order
in
the
history
of
labor
injunctions
on
the
basis
that
if
evidence
is
fragmentary,
as
the
government
has
ought.
and
while
i
say
that
we
make
one
final
observation
upon
the
government's
case.
and
the
government's
supplemental
brief
for
the
first
time
trying
to
meet
my
argument
that
we
have
to
open
only
a
few
plants
based
upon
published
material,
the
government
says
it
is
reliably
informed
that
we'd
have
to
open
the
big
companies
in
us
steel
and
bethlehem.
reliably
informed
by
whom?
we're
not
told.
and
then
from
that,
the
government
proceeds
to
say
that
if
that
were
so,
which
i
doubt
very
much
on
the
basis
of
the
published
material,
these
companies
are
not
the
prime
companies
that
make
this
special
type
of
steel
which
is
custom-made.
then
on
--
on
that
basis,
the
government
says
and
this
i
find
to
be
an
astonishing
statement,
as
though
this
is
the
function
of
the
courts
which
in
my
way
completely
vitiates
the
notion
of
the
courts
are
to
act
judicially.
they
say
if
we
have
to
reopen
us
steel
and
bethlehem,
this
would
be
unfair
to
the
small
employers
in
the
industry.
what
concern
is
that
for
the
government
in
this
proceeding?
the
collective
bargaining
situation
in
our
dispute
with
these
various
companies
is
our
concern
and
the
industry's
concern
and
if
there's
a
public
interest,
as
i
know
there
is,
that
would
be
manifested
according
to
a
congressional
definition
of
that
interest.
congress
debated
at
length
whether
they
would
prohibit
industry
strikes,
whether
they
would
not,
but
the
concept
that
the
government
asserts
that
they
shouldn't
do
this,
they
shouldn't
open
this
plant
or
that
plant
because
the
collective
bargaining
situation
would
be
impaired,
there's
not
a
concept
it
seems
to
me
properly
addressed
to
this
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
express
my
appreciation
for
presuming
on
your
time
in
this
length
of
time.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
reply
to
my
friend,
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
asked
the
question
of
where
we
got
our
1%
figure
from.
if
you'll
look
at
page
92
of
the
record,
you
will
find
that
the
source
is
the
office
of
civil
and
defense
mobilization
of
the
united
states
government.
it's
less
by
quarters,
starting
first
quarter
of
1958,
the
amount
of
shipments
of
steel
products
for
all
defense
purposes,
it
is
less
than
1%
over
the
last
year.
and
i
think
that's
an
appendix
statement
of
the
government's
need
in
the
defense
they're
at.
mr.
justice
black,
you
inquired
as
to
legislative
history
on
health
and
safety.
there
is
some
illumination
in
this
area
that
we
haven't
adverted
to.
senator
smith
was
a
distinguished
man
or
member
of
the
senate
labor
committee,
later
it
became
the
ranking
republican
member.
in
the
debates,
in
this
discussing
this,
he
said,
“furthermore,
entitled
to
the
bill,
we
provide
for
extreme
cases
which
threaten
national
paralysis.”
to
me,
the
industry-wide
stoppage
of
some
kind
which
may
cause
injury
to
the
health
or
safety
of
140
million
people,
such
as
a
transportation
strike
or
a
coal
strike,
we
have
set
up
special
machinery
which
will
unable
the
attorney
general
on
his
own
initiative
to
petition
the
courts
to
prevent
either
a
shut
down
or
a
walkout
until
remediation
processes
have
had
time
to
function.
that's
in
the
legislative
history.
the
--
it's
compiled
by
the
board,
2
legislative
history
1145.
i
referred
earlier
that
i
have
also
at
page
1270,
where
mr.
smith,
in
response
to
questions,
makes
the
same
essential
statement.
i
referred
earlier
to
senator
taft's
statement
where
he
dealt
with
the
automobile
situation,
which
is
also
in
the
legislative
history
and
where
he
again
says
“the
national
health
or
safety
or
condition,
which
either
is
anticipated,
will
not
often
occur.”
now,
there
is
another
reason
that
the
statute
in
this
area
ought
to
be
construed
very
narrowly.
my
friend,
mr.
solicitor
general,
adverted
to
it
in
passing.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
it.
this
statute
is
engrafted
on
the
labor
management
act.
and
section
13,
protecting
the
right
to
strike,
is
still
an
important
and
indispensable
part
of
that
statute.
this
is
a
limited
exemption
to
the
broad
right
to
strike
protected
by
section
13
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
statement
was
made
in
this
court
about
the
number
of
plants
by
the
solicitor
general
will
--
which
might
have
to
be
opened.
this
is
the
first
time
to
get
information
on
this
subject
in
this
court.
the
record
doesn't
contain
one
piece
of
evidence
on
any
construction
of
evidence
giving
the
best
--
best
credence
you
can
to
opinion
evidence.
but
as
i
understand
the
rules,
nevertheless,
must
be
base
upon
fact
as
to
this
particular
fact
which
is
now
given
to
us
about
the
seven
plants.
the
record
does
show
that
over
310
steel
plants
of
varying
types
of
seven-dozen
loom
has
a
large
number.
and
in
the
specific
response
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
steel
can
be
produced
by
the
plants
now
on
strike,
there
is
the
conclusion
to
this
effect
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
but
there
are
no
names,
no
numbers,
no
specification
of
this
fact.
now,
it
is
true
that
steel
is
not
a
completely
a
fungible
commodity,
it
is
a
largely
a
fungible
commodity.
when
i
talked
about
carbon
steel,
that's
a
fungible
commodity,
structural
steel
is
a
fungible
commodity.
the
type
of
steel
that
is
not
a
fungible
commodity
by
and
large
is
steel
alloy,
steels
made
out
of
electric
furnaces.
it
is
not
entirely
true
that
we
don't
know
the
companies
that
make
these
in
the
sense
that
this
is
not
a
publicized
fact.
the
brochures
of
many
companies
openly
say
that
we
make
steel
of
this
type
for
the
missile
programs
for
polaris,
for
atlas,
for
titan.
i
saw
a
couple
of
dozen
of
them
in
my
offices.
they
--
and
they're
--
all
we
have
to
do
is
pick
up
time
magazine
this
week,
and
we
will
find
many
companies
advertising
the
fact
that
they
make
this
steel
for
these
high
priority
highly
confidential
events.
the
problem
we
have
and
have
confronted
and
confronted
with
throughout
is
that
the
government
does
not
specify
in
any
of
its
affidavits
what
these
companies
are.
so,
we
have
had
to
do
a
job
of
reconstruction
which
we
attempted
to
do
in
our
brief,
in
this
document
filed
with
the
clerk,
metal
selector,
october
26
and
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
tried
to
take
the
alloy
steel
by
its
composition
which
is
described
here.
and
companies
are
in
--
in
the
metal
selector
in
industry
magazine.
and
we
try
to
demonstrate
by
these
published
documents
that
the
electric
steel
of
the
various
types
used
for
the
defense
program
is
made
in
the
plans
not
on
strike.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
--
with
the
respect
to
the
national
safety,
it
will
be
the
same
because
the
government
made
no
showing
as
to
this,
that
they
cannot
--
their
affidavits
are
so
inadequate
that
they
do
not
say
except
in
terms
of
conclusion
that
the
program
is
delayed
because
of
this
fact.
they
do
not
point
specifically
to
any
inadequacy
due
to
any
particular
failure
in
the
program
or
because
of
the
strike.
but
you
have
--
i
haven't
taken
the
time
of
this
court
to
review
each
of
the
affidavits.
it
is
done
in
our
brief
and
it
is
done
in
our
application
for
a
stay
in
the
court
of
appeals.
you've
got
statements
like
this
on
the
government.
you've
got
statements
that
steel
is
an
important
commodity.
steel
is
essential
for
our
defenses.
we
are
delayed
in
our
steel
--
in
our
--
in
our
program.
the
delays
may
be
due
to
budgetary
consideration
or
in
the
wall
street
journal,
last
night,
in
which
it
was
said
that
a
good
part
of
the
missile
program
has
been
canceled
out
because
of
budgetary
consideration.
i'm
in
a
lost
to
know
whether
or
not
the
delays
are
due
to
that
or
to
lack
of
steel.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
under
national
health
aspect
of
the
statute,
i
would
say
that
because
steel
--
well,
it
is
not
all
fungible
is
durable
and
isn't
expended
everyday.
the
government
have
to
make
a
showing
that
the
containers
which
are
required,
which
they
have
not
talked
about,
which
are
not
in
the
affidavit,
are
containers
that
are
not
available
out
of
present
inventories
of
containers,
even
if
the
containers
are
not
now
produced.
in
other
words,
we
would
require
a
specification.
they
have
to
prove
their
case
that
this
is
something
that
causes
a
peril
to
the
national
health.
now,
while
they
talk
about
national
health,
let
me
say
this.
i've
been
struggling
since
the
questions
were
asked
this
morning,
mr.
justice
harlan,
your
question,
what
about
this
term
“national”?
and
i
should
have
known
better
because
i
argue
the
case
which
involved
that
question
in
this
court.
the
amalgamated
streetcar
case,
where
there
was
a
health
problem
involving
a
local
utility,
and
it
was
a
gas
utility.
and
this
court
held
under
taft-hartley
act
that
that
local
health
problem
was
not
reachable
under
the
--
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
it
was
not
reachable.
well,
i
assume
that
one
of
the
aspects
of
national
is
the
thing
that
is
involved
in
coal
and
railroad
transportation
that
must
pertain
to
the
nation
at
large.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
in
steel
because
they
have
not
shown
of
the
government
evidence
that
this
involves
the
nation
at
large.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
morning,
you
asked
me
if
the
government
made
a
case
on
safety
but
not
health,
would
that
be
enough
of
the
case.
and
i
said
yes.
i
--
i
ment
--
i
should
have
put
a
copy
which
i
am
sure
was
in
fight
from
my
prior
argument
that
this
is
so,
if
my
other
elements
were
not
proved
like
part
of
the
industry
and
--
and
discretion
and
so.
i
did
it
in
the
sense
if
other
elements
were
not
present,
that
would
be
so.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
the
--
the
selective
character
of
an
injunction
order
that
should
be
entered
was
them,
by
the
government,
i
have
neglected
to
mention
that.
then
the
american
locomotive
case,
our
case,
as
mr.
rankin
has
not
yet
assumed.
in
that
case,
there
were
three
plants
of
the
company.
but
the
injunction
ran
against
one
plant
of
the
same
company
because
that
was
the
plant
that
produced
pipe
for
the
atomic
energy
commission.
and
the
injunction,
it
was
on
dispute
between
one
union
and
one
company.
and
the
injunction
there,
ran
against
one
plant.
it
did
not
run
against
the
three
plants
of
the
company.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
only
that
one
plant.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
only
the
one
plant.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
only
the
one
plant.
the
other
two
plants
were
made
on
strike.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
this
is
the
finding
that
i
objected
to
very
strenuously
but
never
got
final
review
on
that.
i
might
explain
how
that
came
about.
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
effect
that
because
of
the
nature
of
this
fight,
the
--
for
the
atomic
energy
commission,
they
would
say
that
this
type
was
a
special
industry.
that's
the
theory
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
went.
the
solicitor
general
has
said
that
we
have,
for
the
first
time,
talked
about
reopening
mills
for
all
purposes
rather
than
the
defense
in
answer
to
the
argument
that
it
would
be,
mr.
(inaudible),
it
would
be
convenient
and
inconvenient
to
do
so.
this
is
not
our
position.
it
never
was
our
position
in
any
court.
the
record
shows,
record
92.
my
statement
to
the
district
court,
record
153,
that
it
was
theory
that
if
the
plant
had
to
be
reopened
then
it
would
be
reopened
for
all
purposes.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
worry
more
about
you're
question
to
me
about
jurisdiction.
and
maybe
i
have
a
better
answer
now
that
i
gave
them
before
(inaudible)
assistant.
and
that
is
that
where
you
read
the
language
on
jurisdiction
in
--
if
i
may
refer
to
in
page
95
of
the
appendix
to
the
government
brief
section
208
(a)
2
permitted
to
occur
to
continue
will
imperil
the
national,
health
or
safety,
it
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
any
such
strike
or
lockout
or
the
continuing
thereof
and
to
make
such
other
ordinance.
it
is
possible
to
read
that
jurisdiction
applies
to
both,
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
strike
and
jurisdiction
to
make
any
other
ordinance.
this
is
what
judge
hastie
thought,
this
is
what
i
believed
to.
i
ought
to
explain
a
moment
about
the
priority
system.
i
think
mr.
rankin
and
i
are
not
in
fundamental
disagreement
but
i
think
we
would
both
want
to
set
the
record
straight
and
i,
perhaps,
am
little
bit
in
the
air
because
i
think
he
is.
the
priority
system
which
is
administered
by
the
government
operates
this
way.
every
steel
company,
not
every,
but
of
many
steel
companies
operate
under
priority
systems
of
the
--
under
the
defense
production.
and
the
non-struck
companies
as
well
as
the
struck
companies
have
operated
traditionally
under
that
priority
system.
and
under
that
priority
system,
when
the
strike
took
place,
there
was
an
existing
amount
set
aside
for
defense
on
the
state
for
illustration,
10%.
now,
the
non-struck
plants
have
that.
that
was
there
normal
set-aside
for
defense
purposes
when
the
strike
broke
up.
my
complaint
against
the
government
was
that
despite
a
great
strike,
despite
the
length
of
that
strike,
nothing
was
done
to
change
that
set-aside
until
october
the
16th.
on
october
the
16th,
they
were
told
by
an
order
which
is
attached
to
the
brief
which
we
files
on
the
district
court,
which
is
part
of
the
record
here,
we
transmitted
it
in
orders
in
the
record,
they
were
told
that
they
must
accept
for
delivery
during
the
fourth
calendar
quarter
of
1959,
more
orders
even
though
the
applicable
set-aside
has
been
reached.
so
they
were
told
that.
what
they
were
not
told,
this
is
the
point
i
meant
to
make,
was
that
the
rest
of
their
steel
as
they
--
that
--
and
it's
all
specialty
steel
in
many
of
these
plants,
should
be
set
aside
for
filling
other
orders
of
the
government.
of
course,
this
is
what
was
done
in
1956.
all
of
their
specialty
steels
were
frozen
so
that
defense
requirements
could
be
met.
that
would
mean
that
under
the
defense
production
act,
that
steel
could
be
sequestered
for
some
of
these
manufacturers
that
mr.
rankin
adverted
to.
now,
when
my
friend,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
they
need
a
lot
of
steel
for
transportation,
that
statistic
includes
automobile,
and
it
is
a
great
question
as
to
whether
the
automobile
industry
is
necessary
or
detrimental
to
the
health
of
the
united
states.
[laughter]
and
finally
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
--
he
might
not,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
hope
he
won't
be
reading
the
newspapers.
now,
we
should
not
dismiss
the
automobile
industry
so
cavalierly,
not
only
its
impact
on
the
national
economy,
it
uses
25%
of
the
steel
of
the
country,
but
in
addition
to
that,
that
great
industry
is
very
much
in
defense.
it
makes
tanks,
guns,
armored
vehicles,
military
trucks,
jeeps,
missiles
and
a
variety
of
ordinance
required
through
--
for
the
defense
of
the
country.
that,
your
honor.
