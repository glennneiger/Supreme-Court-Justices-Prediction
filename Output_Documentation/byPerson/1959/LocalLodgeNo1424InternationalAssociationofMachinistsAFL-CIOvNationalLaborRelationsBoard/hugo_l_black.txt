justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
--
how
long
was
this
contract
supposed
to
exist?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
board's
holding
mean
that
if
it's
gone
in
entire
two
years,
it
could
have
found
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
six
months
after
its
expiration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
--
even
if
you
make
one
agreement
and
then
you
meet
and
make
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
make
another,
it
has
to
be
--
they
could
be
found
guilty
for
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
time
after
six
months
from
the
last
day
the
contract
was
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
object
of
this
six
months
limitation?
does
the
record
show
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
back
does
this
repayment
order
extend
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
the
position
of
the
board
that
this
does
not
arise
over
the
agreement
or
the
renewal
of
agreement
which
arises
on
the
maintenance
of
the
agreement
from
time
to
time,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
distinction
drawn?
you
referred
to
it
plainly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
valid
on
its
face
and
one
that's
not
valid
on
its
face.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
drawn
in
the
act
or
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
the
agreement
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
provided
that
there'll
be
discrimination
on
account
of
race
or
color
or
religion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
type
of
thing
you're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
invalid
on
its
face.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
kind
--
what
i
suggested
would
be
invalid
on
its
face?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
try,
and
i
think
you
could
help
me
with
your
point
the
--
to
the
exact
wording
of
the
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
which
one
would
we
have
to
rely
to
determine
whether
when
the
contract
was
made,
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
whether
there's
a
daily
unfair
labor
practice.
everyday,
contract
stays
in
existence,
it
was
originally
unfair.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
words
of
the
statute
which
shows
the
unfair
--
that
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
make
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
give
it
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
violations
then
do
you
get
out
of
the
violations
that
comes
from
making
contract
as
illegal?
how
many
violations
would
be
every
day,
every
week,
every
month
or
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
enforce
it
every
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
everyday
it
goes
on,
don't
you,
every
morning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
accept
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
every
day
when
they
collect
dues
because
i
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
violation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
challenging.
i
--
i
simply
want
to
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
may
refuse.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
decide
to
be
wholly
before
you
at
this
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
have
any
case
here
if
you
didn't
have
that
particular
bridge
of
illumination
signing
on
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
man
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
a
man
gives
a
note
and
it's
gone.
it's
bad.
he
doesn't
sue
on
it,
he's
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitation
statute.
in
the
meantime,
the
man
gives
another
note.
can
they
go
back
to
the
first
transaction
to
see
what
the
second
note
ordinarily
and
plead
to
the
statute
of
limitations?
i
suppose
this
is
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
it?
could
you
prove
that
it
was
bad
by
going
back
to
the
first
note
ordinarily?
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
because
the
first
note
was
bad
or
because
the
second
note
was
bad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
go
back
to
my
first
case.
the
notes
there
are
barred
the
statute
of
limitations.
would
that
be
a
good
defense
to
it,
that
it's
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
original
note,
like
you
had
here.
they
had
a
good
defense
to
you
if
you
tried
to
do
anything
on
this
original
execution
of
this
contract,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
it
--
does
the
first
one
get
worse
because
the
--
the
few
notes
given
are
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
repose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
look
at
--
you
look
at
the
act
instead
of
what
you're
looking
at
what
something
somebody's
done
in
the
way
they
reply,
instead
of
looking
it
at
law.
i
may
see
it
one
way,
at
another
way,
the
other.
suppose,
here,
the
--
the
man
here,
you
didn't
have
this
second
thing
at
all.
suppose
they
hadn't
done
anything,
would
you
say
that
you
could
keep
them
all
the
way
up
to
the
violation
of
the
law
through
the
years
even
though
the
congress
has
said
that
in
six
years
--
six
months,
it
should
be
stopped?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
purpose
of
that?
what
is
the
objection
behind
that?
it's
reposed,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
contract,
you
have
a
system
of
making
contracts
and
it's
desirable
at
some
time,
they'd
be
at
rest
so
that
the
public
people
will
know
whether
they
have
a
good
contract
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
would
just
simply
extend
it
like
they've
tried
to
do
in
conspiracy
cases,
wouldn't
it,
by
the
same
method
and
technique?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
much
did
it
rankle
those
six
months
or
that
year?
how
many
rankles
did
the
board
hear
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
any
rankles
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
you
quoting
from
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
want
to
read
it
if
it
is
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
the
witness
who
testified
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
local
701
of
the
cio?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
to
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
given?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
act,
aside
from
10
(b),
that
would
provide
for
any
repose,
any
lack
of
--
any
--
any
time
at
all
within
a
period
of
years
which
would
make
the
contract
not
subject
to
attack
if
it
would
had
originally
a
--
some
defect
in
it,
nobody
raised
it
and
it
was
renewed
and
renewed
from
time
to
time
for
10
years?
is
there
anything
in
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
you
--
if
it
--
like
you
do
now,
you'd
look
back
to
this
first
time
am
i
--
employees
might
have
going
along
for
years.
if
you
ask
what
year,
it's
been
almost
a
year,
and
you
just
look
back
to
see
what
happened
the
first
time,
then
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
here,
you
will
seize
it
if
they
have
a
contract
and
then
renewed
a
contract
and
renewed
a
contract
and
renewed
a
contract.
it's
still
going
on.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
court,
under
circumstances
like
that,
they
might
--
i
expected
you
to
give
another
answer,
maybe
it's
--
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
a
good
answer,
the
courts
is
just
acting
somewhat
in
the
equitable
capacity
to
hold
that
it's
barred
by
laches?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fact,
it
broadened
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
knew
that,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
started
out,
they
knew
there
was
a
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wanted
a
way
to
find
it's
invalid
or
to
do
something
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
way,
do
you
have
now,
without
waiting
for
the
memorandum,
the
cases
where
the
company
applied
this
rule,
where
the
board
applies
this
rule
in
company
union
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
it
supports
your
view
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
when
--
don't
you
have
any
cited
that
supports
yours
in
what
the
board
had
done
before
in
company
union
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know.
what
company
union
situations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
--
what's
the
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
union
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
union
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
a
regular
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
a
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
not
a
company
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
as
part
of
the
evidence?
did
they
base
it,
the
holding,
at
all
on
the
unfair
--
on
the
unfair
labor
practice
at
the
beginning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
standing
alone.
what
--
you
had
actions
if
--
that
the
board
put
its
holding
on
them.
they
didn't
put
it
in
part
on
--
or
did
it,
put
it
in
part
on
the
original
making
of
the
--
of
the
original
one
that
was
barred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
used
that
as
evidence
from
which
to
infer
that
later
on,
it
was
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
his
brief
before
you
wrote
yours?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
refer
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
refer
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
did
the
--
this
last
one
you're
talking
about
now,
did
it
refer
to
the
report
on
10
(b)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
say
anything
inconsistent
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
interpretation
that
was
shown
should
be
made
by
that
report?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
i
understand
it,
you
--
what
you're
saying
is
watered
down.
the
chief
thing
they
did
was
to
say
that
company
unions
couldn't
take
advantage
of
this
as
it
give
them
the
repose,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
drawing
from
that
conclusion
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
be
entirely
construed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
to
those
that
are
not
company
unions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
exempted
renewals
authorizing
an
attack
on
the
renewal
from
the
date
it
was
renewed.
that's
what
you
mean,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
this
--
when
was
this
--
when
was
this
contract
renewed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
doesn't
come
then
within
the
time,
the
six
months,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
would
be
no
--
he
would
have
no
case
here,
would
he,
if
he
was
claiming
--
if
you
were
claiming
that
unfair
treatment
of
contracts
dated
from
the
time
the
renewal
of
contract
was
renewed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
within
six
months
of
that,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
we
would
have
--
so
that
you'd
have
no
repose
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
--
do
you
have
enough
evidence
here
to
justify
a
holding
is
an
unfair
trade
practice
considering
this
only
as
the
renewal
of
the
contract?
has
that
been
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
you
--
you
couldn't
prove
that
they
had
--
didn't
have
a
majority
when
they
made
the
renewal
of
contracts,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
try
to
prove
here
that
there
wasn't
a
majority
when
they
renewed
it?
they
didn't
represent
the
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
been
operating
for
about
12
months.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
this
based
on
the
fact
that
they've
disobeyed
an
order
or
is
it
based
on
the
fact
that
they
made
an
illegal
contract
and
then
renewed
an
illegal
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
defined
in
cases
where
there
were
no
statutes
of
limitations
involved,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
