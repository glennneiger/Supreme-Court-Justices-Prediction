mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
here
show
that
in
august
of
1954,
at
a
time
when
the
union
did
not
represent
a
single
employee
and
indeed,
had
made
no
effort
to
organize
them,
the
company
and
the
union
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
the
contract
required
the
union
--
require
--
recognized
the
union
as
the
employees'
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
it
compelled
the
employees
as
a
condition
of
maintaining
employment
to
join
the
union
within
45
days
and
to
remain
members
in
good
standing.
and
to
implement
the
latter
provision,
it
provided
that
upon
receipt
of
a
signed
authorization
of
the
employee,
the
company
would
check
off
each
month
the
initiation
fees
and
dues
payable
to
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
it
--
it
would
have.
mr.
norton
j.
come
to
accord
recognition
to
a
--
exclusive
recognition
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
to
a
minority
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think,
under
the
board's
theory,
you
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
new
theory,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
from
the
beginning,
the
enactment
of
10
(b),
the
board
has
taken
the
view
that
it
is
a
statute
of
limitations
and
not
a
rule
of
evidence.
the
effect
of
it
is
to
bar
a
liability
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
committed
in
the
past
but
not
to
preclude
the
board
from
looking
at
relevant
evidence
in
the
past
for
the
purpose
of
shedding
light
on
conduct
that
is
occurring
within
the
limitations
period.
indeed,
quite
early
in
the
board's
experience
with
10
(b),
you
had
a
number
of
cases
where
the
union
security
clause
in
the
contract
was
defective,
in
that,
instead
of
providing
for
30
days
within
which
to
become
a
union
member,
it
required
that
you
had
to
become
a
union
member
immediately
or
some
lesser
period.
these
contracts
were
entered
into
outside
the
six
months
period
but
they
continued
to
be
enforced
within
the
limitations
period.
the
board
took
the
position
and
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
the
question
sustained
the
board
in
the
view
that
since
the
contract
continued
to
be
enforced,
the
statute
of
limitations
in
10
(b)
had
not
even
begun
to
operate.
now,
the
--
it
is
true
that
in
those
cases,
the
illegality
of
the
union
security
clause
was
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
contract,
but
that
was
not
the
rationale
on
which
the
court
sustained
the
board.
the
rationale
was
that
you
had
a
continuing
unfair
labor
practice
going
on
so
long
as
the
contract
continued
to
be
enforced
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
has
been
well-established,
at
least
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
where
you
have
a
contract
that
compels
union
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment,
you
have
a
violation
of
the
act
not
only
at
the
time
that
you
execute
the
contract.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
you
are
forcing
the
employees
to
risk
discharge
if
they
do
not
join
the
union
but
thereafter,
each
time
that
you
enforced
the
contract,
enforce
employees
to
pay
dues
under
that
contract
or
discharge
them
for
failure
to
do
so,
you
are
further
invading
their
statutory
rights.
now,
the
closest
case
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
every
time
that
you
enforce
the
contract,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
probably
every
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
every
month.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
contract
continues
in
effect,
it
does
exert
a
continuing
coercion
on
the
employees
but
you
certainly
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
you
certainly
do
not
have
anything
as
dramatic
or
tangible
as
when
you
are
collecting
dues
under
this
contract
each
month.
and
what
occurs
there
is
--
is
certainly
not
in
the
realm
of
speculation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
each
month,
these
employees
had
to
pay
dues
to
the
union.
if
they
didn't
pay
dues
to
the
union,
they
would
be
discharged
for
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
it
--
it
does,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case
because
you
have
the
union
security
clause
here
which
is
certainly
operating
in
a
very
immediate
sense
each
month
when
dues
are
paid.
employees
could
have
been
discharged
under
this
contract.
the
mere
fact
that
under
--
on
this
record,
non-order
doesn't
change
the
realities
of
the
situation
because,
as
i
understand
petitioners'
position,
it
would
be
the
same.
we
couldn't
even
reach
those
discharges.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
is
possible
to
say
that
there
would
not
be
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
rationale
of
the
board's
decisions
in
the
company
union
cases
that
mr.
dunau
has
cited.
since
they
have
occurred
a
number
of
years
before
this
decision,
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
the
board
continues
to
adhere
to
them
but
assuming
that
they
do
represent
the
board's
position,
i
think
they
are
compatible
with
its
position
in
this
case
because,
in
those
cases,
all
you
had
was
the
contract
subsisting.
it
entered
into
the
contract
with
the
dominated
union
and
then
left
things
alone.
the
union
just
operated
under
the
contract
but
there
was
no
provision
for
check-off
of
dues
and
the
company
didn't
do
anything
to
further
the
original
acts
that
gave
the
union
that
contract.
i
think
that
it
is
possible
to
draw
a
distinction
along
those
lines.
mr.
norton
j.
come
then
you
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
and
there
was
nothing
like
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh,
yes,
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
there
are,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
would
be.
the
cases
that
mr.
dunau
refers
to,
however,
are
cases
in
which
nothing
like
that
was
done.
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
recall
that
i
have
one
in
my
brief,
your
honor.
i
would
be
glad
to
locate
one
and
submit
it
to
the
court
after
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
surely.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
i
will.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
would
say
that
the
latter
situation
would
make
a
much
harder
case,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
our
case,
though,
is
the
--
is
the
case
where
the
--
well,
there
is
something
occurring
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
no
question
that
you
do,
your
honor,
but
that
in
itself,
we
submit,
is
--
is
not
enough
to
run
a
file
of
10
(b)
because
we
are
not
predicating
any
liability
based
upon
those
past
acts.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but,
your
honor,
you
don't
have
a
case
in
a
number
of
other
situations
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
have
--
has
sustained
the
board's
position.
for
example,
i
give
you
the
situation
in
--
in
the
paramount
cap
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
where
an
employee
is
discharged
within
the
limitations
period.
the
employer
says
he's
discharged
for
cause.
now,
you
look
at
the
employer's
reasons
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
caused
but
you'd
have
no
evidence
of
anti-union
motivation
at
all
occurring
within
the
six-month
period.
mr.
norton
j.
come
here,
your
honor,
the
violation,
as
found
by
the
board,
is
maintaining
a
union
security
provision
that
did
not
comply
with
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
there
is
no
violation
predicated
on
the
execution
of
the
original
contract
and
the
dues
reimbursement
provision
excludes
that
period.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
this
particular
case,
probably
not.
however
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
you
could,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
because
the
second
note
was
bad.
you're
predicating
liability
on
the
second
note.
you're
not
predicating
--
it's
like
a
continuing
tort,
in
--
in
a
sense,
in
the
example
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
gave.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
original
note?
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
so,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
--
i
think
it
is.
i
don't
think
that
when
you
continue
to
do
something
affirmatively
here,
you're
in
the
situation
which
is
contemplated
by
the
notion
that
you
ought
to
have
reposed.
yet,
you'd
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
understand
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
purpose
of
the
repose
is
to
bar
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
reposed
when
you
have
stopped
the
conduct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
had
there
been
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
your
honor,
when
you're
enforcing
a
--
a
union
security
clause
each
month,
as
you
--
as
you
did
here,
you
don't
have
a
dispute
that
dies
down.
as
the
court
below
observed,
the
dispute
here
involved
is
not
the
kind
which
varies
easily
but
rankles
at
least
once
a
month.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
got
the
--
we
got
the
charge
which
initiated
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
got
the
first
charge,
your
honor,
within
10
months
of
the
execution
of
the
contract
which
we
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
---
which,
we
submit,
is
not
unduly
long
in
these
matters
because
you
must
remember
that
the
company
here
was
building
up
its
workforce.
you
had
new
employees
being
added
over
this
period.
it
takes
a
while
for
the
employees
to
find
out
what's
going
on
and
to
build
off
enough
support
to
want
to
do
something
about
it.
and
i'll
--
i'll
elaborate
on
that
when
i
come
back.
mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
started
to
point
out
at
the
--
at
the
recess,
the
kind
of
situation
that
you
had
here
--
well,
you
had
the
continuing
application
in
the
union
security
clause
going
on.
we
kept
the
dispute,
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
rankling
at
least
once
a
month
in
the
mind
of
the
employees,
and
the
record
bears
this
out.
it
shows
that
an
error
of
uncertainty
prevailed
among
the
employees
as
to
how
the
union
got
in
when
they
learned
of
the
union
security
agreement.
their
inquiries
met
evasive
replies
and
accusations
of
being
troublemakers.
now,
what
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
quoting
from
the
--
my
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
findings
of
the
board,
as
set
forth
in
--
in
our
brief,
bear
out
--
i'm
paraphrasing,
your
honor,
“however,
the
continued
application
of
the
contract
kept
the
employees
wondering
and
toward
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
the
contract
when
it
became
appropriate
to
reopen
it,
the
questioning
resumed
and
at
this
time,
the
iam
representative
explained
to
a
group
of
the
employees
that
the
union
had
gotten
in
because
it
had
the
company
connected
with
bryan
over
a
barrel.”
this
is
at
record
reference
101.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
iam
representative
explained
to
the
employees,
as
late
as
the
summer
of
1955,
about
10
months
after
the
contract
had
run
when
they
were
continuing
to
wonder
why
it
is
that
they
--
that
the
iam
had
--
had
gotten
this
contract.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
the
union
had
gotten
in,
this
is
the
iam
representative
explaining
to
the
employees
because
it
had
a
company
connected
with
bryan,
the
petitioner
here,
over
a
barrel.
in
other
words,
the
contract
with
the
union
and
bryan
was
part
of
the
quid
pro
quo
for
settling
some
other
dispute
that
the
union
had
with
another
related
employer.
and
shortly,
thereafter,
the
charges
here
were
filed.
so
you
didn't
have
something
that
--
that
died
down
right
at
the
outset.
and,
we
submit,
the
realities
of
industrial
life
are
such
that,
in
a
matter
of
this
sort,
you
do
not
end
with
the
execution
of
the
contract,
particularly
where,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
you
have
new
employees
that
are
being
added
here
throughout
the
period.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
it
was
one
of
the
employees,
your
honor.
that's
at
record
101,
testifying
as
to
what
the
union
organizer,
mr.
schwartzmiller,
had
told
him.
mr.
norton
j.
come
this
is
local
1424
of
--
it
was
--
i
didn't
get
your
question.
was
the
witness
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
a
member
of
--did
the
cio
have
--
have
a
contract
any
time
during
its
term?
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
this
is
the
machinists
representative,
local
lodge
1424,
the
petitioner
here,
explaining
to
one
of
the
employees
at
the
plant
as
to
how
it
was
that
this
union
got
into
the
plant
and
got
a
contract
which
compel
the
employee
to
join
the
union.
the
board
credited
this
testimony.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
given
in
june
of
1955,
after
the
contract
had
run
about
10
months,
your
honor,
the
--
the
initial
contract.
so,
we
have
here
a
situation
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
inference,
your
honor,
that
the
board
draws
from
this
testimony
and
from
the
related
testimony
of
the
other
witnesses
was
that
the
union
organizers
made
no
secret
about
the
fact
that
they
got
in
not
because
they
had
organized
the
employees
but
because
the
employer
had
given
them
a
contract.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
that
is
not
disputed.
the
union
is
not
denying
here
or
disputing,
as
i
understand
it,
the
findings
of
the
board
that
it
did
not
have
a
majority
at
the
time
the
contract
was
--
was
entered
into.
i
just
wanted
to
indicate
that
the
employees
continued
to
have
some
question
about
this,
long
after
the
contract
was
--
was
executed.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
it
bears
on
--
on
the
issue
in
the
sense
that
the
argument
is
made
that
the
statute
of
limitations
are
intended
to
--
to
give
repose.
and
our
answer
to
that
is
that,
that
is
true
in
a
situation
where
the
conduct
has
stopped
but
where
you
have
a
continuing
enforcement
of
the
contract,
as
you
had
here,
you
continue
to
dispute
and
it
rankled
--
it
bothered
the
employees
each
month,
and
i
was
just
pointing
out
that
that
fact
which
you
could
reasonably
expect
would
happen
was
indeed
borne
out
by
the
--
by
the
record
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
you
could,
your
honor,
but
you'd
have
greater
difficulty
in
--
in
proving
that
that
was
sought.
i
think
that
where
you
have
something
as
affirmative
as
a
continuing
collection
of
dues,
you
are
taking
some
positive
steps
within
the
period
to
continue
the
wrong
that
was
perpetrated
at
the
--
at
the
outset.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
we
might
get
close
to
those
company
union
cases
that
mr.
dunau
has
--
has
cited.
it
might
make
a
difference
where
there
was
no
--
where
the
situation
remained
passive
within
the
period,
but
that
is
not
this
case
and
i
think
that,
in
this
case,
we
have
some
very
positive
acts
that
were
occurring
which
are
clearly
--
would
amount
to
additional
unfair
labor
practices
but
for
the
10
(b)
problem
here.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
no
barrier
here
because
we
looked
at
the
past
events
merely
for
shedding
light
on
what
occurred
here.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
situation
you
present,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it's
pretty
well
settled,
at
least
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
you
have
separate
unfair
labor
practices
not
only
when
you
enforce
an
illegal
union
security
clause.
you've
got
an
unfair
labor
practice
at
the
time
of
the
execution
and
you
have
got
it
when
you
--
when
you
enforce
it.
the
second
circuit,
i
think,
made
that
clear
in
the
gaynor
news
case
which
is
a
little
bit
closer
to
the
situation
that
we
have
here
than
the
illegal
on
its
face
cases
that
i
mentioned
at
the
--
at
the
outset.
in
the
gaynor
news
case,
you
had
a
union
security
clause
that
was
illegal
not
because
of
anything
that
appeared
from
the
face
of
the
contract,
i
mean,
the
clause
there
provided
for
becoming
a
union
member
within
45
days
is
permitted
by
8
(a)
(3),
but
the
clause
was
illegal
because,
at
the
time
the
contract
was
entered
into,
there
had
not
been
a
union
shop
election
as
required
by
section
9
(e)
of
the
act.
so,
it
was
necessary
to
leave
the
face
of
the
contract
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
this
past
event
had
occurred.
and
the
board
found
and
the
second
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
judge
frank
upheld
the
board's
finding
that
10
(b)
was
not
barred
here.
whatever
may
be
said
about
the
execution
of
the
contract,
the
maintenance
of
that
illegal
contract
within
the
limitations
period,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
you
had
to
leave
the
face
of
the
contract
to
determine
its
illegality,
was
a
separate
unfair
labor
practice
as
to
which,
as
judge
frank
put
it,
the
limitations
period
had
not
yet
begun
to
run.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
my
argument
comes
close
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
logic
of
the
--
of
the
board's
position,
assuming
that
the
contract
continued
to
be
enforced
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
would
permit
that.
however,
we
have
running
across
that
however.
the
concurrent
principle
of
the
weight
and
relevancy
of
--
to
be
given
to
--
to
ancient
evidence
in
a
situation
such
as
that,
it
might
be
extremely
difficult
for
the
board
to
obtain
any
probative
evidence
that
could
establish
the
original
illegality.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
not
predicating
any
liability
on
the
original
making
of
the
contract.
we
are
looking
to
the
events
surrounding
that
and
it's
not
necessary
for
us
to
determine
that
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it's
--
it
happens
to
be
accidental
that
those
past
events
would
to
add
up
to
an
independent
unfair
labor
practice
of
their
own,
but
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
use
which
the
--
which
the
board
puts
the
facts
that
it
gathers
from
the
past
period.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
look
to
the
making
of
the
contract
to
see
whether
or
not,
within
the
current
period,
the
union
has
available
to
it
the
defense
that
it
is
privilege
to
exact
these
dues
payments
because
it
was
the
majority
--
it
is
the
majority
representative.
the
collection
of
--
of
dues
and
the
requiring
of
employees
to
join
a
union
as
a
condition
of
employment
is
the
clearest
form
of
violation
of
the
act
and
had
we
had
nothing
more
than
that
and
this
contract
were
--
were
not
in
the
picture,
there'd
be
no
question
that
there'd
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
the
company
comes
forward
with
the
--
with
the
contract.
at
that
point,
the
question
is
whether
the
contract
really
affords
them
a
defense,
and
the
board
is
going
to
the
past
period
there
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
defense
of
majority
status
is
available
to
the
union
with
respect
to
the
acts
that
it's
performing
currently.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is,
other
than
the
difficulties
of
proof
that
you
would
have.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
a
conduct
that
has
--
that
has
seized.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
original
dispute
is
being
continued
currently.
it's
the
--
it's
the
nature
of
this
particular
controversy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it's
been
held
that
laches
does
not
apply
to
the
government
in
particularly,
the
board
proceedings.
however,
the
board
itself,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
10
(b),
did
have
a
laches
principle
which
it
invoked
on
its
own.
if
it
found
that
an
employee,
for
example,
was
unduly
delayed
in
--
in
filing
a
charge
of
a
wrongful
discharge,
it
would
toll
the
running
of
--
of
back
pay.
and
i
think
that
it
is
within
the
board's
discretion
and
power
to
do
that
even
apart
from
--
from
10
(b).
now,
i'd
like
to
talk
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
--
as
i
--
as
i
think
i
indicated
earlier,
this
continuing
violation
theory
is
not
a
new
one.
that
has
been
applied
in
a
number
of
--
of
illegal
union
security
cases,
all
of
which
are
mentioned
in
our
brief,
in
situations
where
the
agreement
was
invalid
on
its
face
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
or
in
the
gaynor
case
were
not
on
its
face
but
because
of
some
condition
that
they
didn't
satisfy
with
respect
to
getting
a
union
authorization
election.
this
is
the
first
case
where
the
infirmity
in
the
contract
is
of
the
type
that
--
that
we
have
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
valid
on
its
face,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think,
analytically,
it
is
probably
the
company
and
the
union
that
do
but
as
soon
as
the
contract
comes
to
light,
the
burden
is
then
shifted
to
the
--
to
the
board
to
establish
the
validity
of
the
contract.
mr.
norton
j.
come
or
the
invalidity
of
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think,
analytically,
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
as
a
--
as
a
practical
matter,
the
board,
in
investigating
these
cases,
is
going
to
try
to
anticipate
possible
defenses,
and
they're
going
to
look
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
a
contract
in
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that?
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
i
think,
analytically,
it
is
correct
that
the
contract
is
a
--
is
a
defense
because
if
you
did
not
have
the
contract
in
the
picture
and
you
had
only
the
allegation
that
the
employees
were
being
compelled
to
join
a
union
and
pay
dues
on
its
face,
there,
you
--
you
have,
unquestionably,
a
--
a
prima
facie
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
have
them.
mr.
dunau
has
cited
some
in
his
brief,
and
i
was
going
to
supply
some
additional
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
“dissupport”
his
view
point.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
i
have
them
to
support
my
position
in
what
the
board
has
done
in
other
situations
where
they
have
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
one
--
i
have
one
company
union
case,
namely,
superior
engraving,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
norton
j.
come
superior
engraving.
that
is
a
seventh
circuit
opinion,
mr.
justice
black,
which
is
183
f.2d
783.
in
that
case,
i
might
indicate,
the
situation
was
this.
you
had
a
refusal
to
bargain
and
unilateral
wage
increases
within
the
limitations
period.
at
the
time
this
occurred,
the
union
did
not
have
--
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees.
therefore,
the
employer's
action
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that?
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
remember
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
was
not
a
company
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
a
regular
union.
therefore,
the
employer's
action
was
unlawful
only
if
the
loss
of
majority
were
attributable
to
prior
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
in
that
case,
it
was
held
that
section
10
(b)
did
not
bar
evidence
that
the
employer
had
engaged
in
8
(a)
(2)
activity
with
respect
to
another
union
which
had
the
effect
of
dissipating
the
majority
of
the
outside
union
within
the
limitations
period.
and
the
board's
finding
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
was
sustained
by
the
--
by
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
it
was
based
solely
on
that
because
all
that
you
had
within
the
limitations
period
were
actions
which,
standing
alone,
did
not
give
you
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
original
one
that
was
--
that
was
barred,
the
assistance
to
the
company
union
was
the
basis
for
finding
that
the
loss
of
majority
of
the
independent
union
within
the
period
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
that
we
did,
your
honor,
because
we
regarded
the
situation
there
as
being
distinguishable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
did
not,
in
those
cases,
have
any
of
the
affirmative
action
that
you
had
in
--
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.i
intend
to
do
that
in
this
memorandum
that
i
have
leave
to
follow.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not.
as
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
--
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
right,
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
requested,
and
i
understood
that
that
was
to
be
included,
that
i
comment
upon
mr.
dunau's
cases.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
just
coming
to
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
have
discussed
it
in
our
brief
however.
we
believe
that
the
riders
had
a
broader
sweep
than
10
(b).
in
the
first
place,
the
language
of
the
original
rider
which
was
introduced
in
1944
provided
in
relevant
part
that
no
funds
shall
be
used
in
any
way
in
connection
with
a
complaint
arising
over
an
agreement
between
management
and
labor
which
has
been
in
existence
for
three
months
or
longer
without
a
complaint
being
filed.
this
language
would
have
precluded
using
the
agreement
for
any
purposes.
you
couldn't
predicate
a
violation
on
the
contract
even
if
it
were
invalid
on
its
face,
a
situation
which
petitioners
concede
would
not
be
barred
by
section
10
(b).
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that,
and
this
is
borne
out
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
--
of
the
riders,
that
the
purpose
that
congress
had
there
was
a
broader
purpose
than
they
had
with
respect
to
10
(b).
they
weren't
concerned
solely
with
protecting
against
stale
claims
rather,
the
riders
were
designed
to
prevent
interruptions
to
war
production
through
a
tax
by
outside
unions
on
closed-shop
contracts
that
had
been
entered
into
in
the
--
in
the
defense
industries
and
--
and
the
shipyards
where
the
necessary
production
was
being
gotten
out
and
the
employees
immediately
involved
weren't
complaining
about
the
illegality
of
the
contract.
in
other
words,
it
was
aimed
at
preventing
disruption
to
wartime
production.
what
this
wartime
objective,
congress
could
well
have
continence
and,
we
in
--
as
we
think
the
language
of
the
riders
shows,
more
of
an
invasion
on
the
statutory
rights
of
the
employees.
then,
it
was
going
to
permit
in
1947
when
it
came
around
to
enacting
a
limitations
provision
as
such.
and
therefore,
we
think
that
when
congress
said
in
the
senate
report
that
the
riders
were
unnecessary
because
they
were
now
enacting
a
limitations
provision.
this
was
merely
a
generalized
statement
to
the
effect
that,
since
they
were
dealing
with
questions
of
liability
for
past
unfair
labor
practices,
specifically
in
10
(b),
the
rider
was
no
longer
needed
without
necessarily
suggesting
that
the
scope
of
the
rider
was
the
same
as
that
of
10
(b)
which,
from
the
reading
that
i
have
given
to
this
court,
it
is
apparent
that
it
is
not.
moreover,
it
is
very
interesting
that
by
the
time
congress
got
around
to
enacting
10
(b),
the
rider
had
--
had
been
so
watered
down
that
in
fact,
it
would
even
have
had
less
scope
than
10
(b)
has
even
under
the
board's
interpretation
because
in
the
years
subsequent
to
1944,
when
it
was
first
enacted,
they
excluded
contracts
with
company-dominated
unions.
in
other
words,
the
three-month
bar
didn't
--
didn't
apply
to
that
kind
of
a
contract.
they
excluded
renewals
of
an
--
this
is
from
the
riders,
renewals
of
an
existing
contract
on
the
three-month
limitation.
and
then
the
very
same
congress
which
enacted
10
(b),
despite
the
fact
that
they
said
that
the
rider
wasn't
necessary,
goes
ahead
and
nevertheless
enacts
a
rider
for
1948.
and
in
that
rider,
they
give
immunity
only
to
contracts
with
a
majority
union,
and
the
reason
they
say
that
is
that
they
didn't
want
to
sanction
these
sweetheart
arrangements.
but
a
contract
is
entered
into
when
the
union
does
not
represent
a
minority.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
it
--
it
means
that
the
statement
in
the
report
should
not
be
taken
--
given
literal
effect
to
it
in
any
way
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that?
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there's
no
question
that
10
(b)
--
that
the
report
did
refer
to
the
rider.
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did
not
refer
to
the
report.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
certainly
said
the
statement
that
it
has
made
is
inconsistent
with
the
interpretation
of
10
(b)
that
the
petitioners
are
urging
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
that
the
report
indicates
what
interpretation
should
be
made.
it
merely
says
that
they're
imposing
a
statute
of
limitations
and
that
makes
the
rider

mr.

norton
j.

yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
is
watered
down
to
this
extent.
it
is
watered
down
to
the
extent
that
it
exempted
contracts
with
company-dominated
unions
because
that
was
put
in
1945
and
also,
renewals
of
existing
contracts.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
it
isn't
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
--
it
is
your
honor.
the
“provided
further,”
that's
down
at
the
bottom
of
36
and
up
at
the
top,
“provided
further
that
these
limitations
shall
not
apply
to
agreements”.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
first
clause
there
where
it
says
“no
part
of
the
funds
appropriated
shall
be
used
in
connection
with
a
complaint
case
arriving
over
an
agreement
--
an
agreement
or
a
renewal
thereof”.
now,
the
board's
explanation
of
that
clause
“or
a
renewal
thereof”
is
given
in
its
report
which
is
on
pages
42
and
43
of
mr.
dunau's

i'm
sorry,

oh,
it's

that's
borne

the
comptroller

explanation

item
2
in
the
footnote
there,
under
the
1945
amendment,
in
contrast
to
the
1944
limitations,
the
renewal
of
an
agreement
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
reading
from
the
footnote
on
page
44
of
mr.
dunau's
brief.
mr.
norton
j.
come
under
number
2
there
on
the
footnote.
mr.
norton
j.
come
under
the
1945
amendment
in
contrast
to
the
1944
limitation,
the
renewal
of
an
agreement,
even
though
by
virtue
of
the
operation
of
an
automatic
renewal
clause,
starts
anew
a
running
of
the
three-month
period
during
which
a
charge
attacking
the
agreement
may
be
filed.
mr.
norton
j.
come
then,
on
top
of
--
of
those
two
things,
you
have
added
the
majority
union
exception
that
i
mentioned,
which
it
is
true,
was
passed
after
the
senate
report
was
issued
but
nevertheless,
was
enacted
by
the
very
same
congress
which
enacted
10
(b).
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
could
be,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
wasn't
applicable
in
1955.
it
--
it
stopped
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what
is
that?
no,
no,
it
--
it
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
but
i'm
--
i'm
merely
saying
that
if
you're
going
to
interpret
10
(b),
precisely
what
the
scope
that
the
rider
would
have
had,
by
the
time
10
(b)
came
around,
the
rider
was
watered
down
to
such
an
extent
that
it
would
not
have
precluded
the
board
from
reaching
the
kind
of
a
contract
that
you
had
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
they
said,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
said
they
did
two
other
things.
they
also
exempted
renewals
of
an
existing
contract
and
finally,
in
1948,
they
exempted
the
contracts
with
minority
unions.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
renewed
in
august
of
1955.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
made
in
august
of
1954.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
charges
were
filed
with
--
in
--
in
june
of
--
in
august
of
1955.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
but
you
would
still
have
to
prove
the
illegality
in
the
renewal
from
the
--
from
the
past
elapsed
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
you'd
have
no
repose
because
they
were
continuing
the
contract,
and
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
you
wouldn't
have
had
a
repose
under
the
rider
either.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
we
have
the
same
--
we
would
have
to
rely
on
the
same
evidence
that
we
rely
on
for
holding
that
the
maintenance
of
the
old
contract
and
the
renewal
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
you
couldn't
prove
it
without
regard
to
how
the
majority
was
obtained
to
begin
with.
it
was
a
coerced
majority
at
the
outset.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
that
momentum
continued
throughout
the
period
because
there
was
nothing
done
to
dissipate
the
momentum.
it
was
built
up
by
the
--
by
the
original
coercion,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you
couldn't
do
that
because
the
check-off
was
operating
and
every
employee
who
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
question
is
whether
that
check-off
was
properly
entitled
to
operate
or
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
franks
brothers
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
is
not
based
on
an
order
of
this
court
but
the
principle
of
the
cases
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
referring
to
is
that
once
the
employer
has
engaged
in
a
course
of
illegal
conduct
which
has
had
the
effect
of
dissipating
the
--
the
union's
majority,
unless
there
is
some
affirmative
action
to
remedy
that,
it
cannot,
and
the
board
is
justified
in
--
in
so
holding,
you
cannot
create
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
--
but
the
principle,
we
submit,
is
the
--
is
the
same
here.
my
time
has
expired.
i
--
i
just
want
to
indicate
that
the
board's
position
on
the
reimbursement
point,
we
believe,
is
fully
set
forth
in
our
brief.
thank
you.
