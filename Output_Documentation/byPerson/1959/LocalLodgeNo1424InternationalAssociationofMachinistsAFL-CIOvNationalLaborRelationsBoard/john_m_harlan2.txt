justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
a
charge
based
on
the
original
making
of
the
agreement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
stated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where?
justice
john
m.
harlan
turning
it
around
the
other
way,
for
a
minute,
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
original
agreement
has
not
been
infected
as
it
was,
there
would
have
been
no
basis
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
other
hand,
what
would
be
the
basis
of
authority
for
the
check-off
of
dues
and
compulsory
membership
except
for
the
contract?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
give
me
the
citation
of
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
interrupt
you
there
for
a
moment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
this
agreement
contained
no
security
at
all
and
entered
into
(inaudible)
would
that
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
accord
to
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
assuming
again
you
waited
more
than
six
months
and
you
have
brought
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
that
you
brought
here
on
such
a
(inaudible)
on
your
theory?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
could
have.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
still
have
to
know
the
facts
in
order
to
obtain
what
you
say
is
a
recurring
act
to
the
enforcement
of
the
check-off
and
you
--
you
still
have
to
go
back
in
order
to
taint
that
within
the
period
of
limitation
by
the
original
vice
that
inhered
in
this
contract.
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
any
liability
at
all.
independently
of
that,
you
don't
have
a
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that's
a
wholly
different
situation
because
there,
the
charge
is
that
he
was
discriminatorily
discharged.
in
order
to
give
color
to
the
character
of
this
discharge,
whether
it
was
--
was
discriminatory
or
not,
you
can
then
go
back
and
to
hear
evidence
to
show
what
the
nature
of
it
was.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
bear
on
the
issue
you've
got?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
that
same
--
you
could
make
that
same
argument
in
the
(inaudible)
where
there's
no
union
security
clause
involved.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
union,
during
this
period,
had
been
complaisant
about
the
--
the
security
fee,
it
accepted
the
fee
and
voluntarily
paid
a
followup
--
followup
on
those
who
pay,
what
would
your
situation
be
like?
