mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
questions
in
this
case,
one
of
limitations,
the
other
of
remedy.
the
limitations
question
can
be
put
in
a
nutshell.
section
10
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
in
part
that
no
complaint
shall
issue
based
upon
any
unfair
labor
practice
occurring
more
than
six
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charge
with
the
board
and
the
service
of
a
copy
thereof
upon
the
person
against
whom
such
charge
is
made.
an
employer
and
a
union
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
by
which,
the
union
is
recognized
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
and
which
contains
a
conventional
union
shop
agreement
or
provision.
the
agreement
is,
in
all
respects,
valid
on
its
face.
however,
at
the
time
it
was
entered
into,
the
union
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
within
the
unit.
more
than
six
months
later,
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
is
filed.
based
upon
that
charge,
a
complaint
issues
and
the
board
finds
that
within
the
six-month
period,
the
company
and
the
union
continued
the
agreement
in
effect
and
executed
and
continued
a
second
agreement
in
effect,
and
these
acts
within
the
six-month
period
constitute
unfair
labor
practices.
the
sole
foundation
for
the
conclusion
that
the
acts
within
the
period
constitute
unfair
labor
practices
are
the
unfair
labor
practice
of
entering
into
the
agreement
when
the
union
had
no
majority
which
occurred
more
than
six
months
before
the
charge
was
filed.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
the
charges
were
based
upon
the
original
making
of
the
agreement.
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
so
many
words,
your
honor.
the
amended
charge
stated
--
the
original
charge
against
the
company
and
the
amended
charge
against
the
union
stated
in
so
many
words,
inter
alia,
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
on
august
10,
1954,
the
unions
were
not
unassisted
and/or
majority
representatives
of
the
employees
in
the
unit.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
charge
against
the
union,
the
first
one,
appears
on
page
260,
the
charge
against
the
employer
on
263
and
the
amended
charge
against
the
union
on
page
265.
the
complaints
themselves,
inter
alia,
alleged
that
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
entry
into
the
first
agreement
and
at
the
time
of
the
entry
into
the
second
agreement,
the
union
did
not
in
fact
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
within
the
bargaining
unit.
it
was
solely
upon
the
basis
of
that
unfair
labor
practice
which
antedated
the
charge
by
more
than
six
months
that
the
complaint
--
that
the
conduct
within
the
six
months
period
was
adjudicated
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
board
reasons
that
it
is
adjudicating
the
continuing
effects
within
the
six
months
and
that
it
is
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
entry
into
the
agreement
more
than
six
months
before
as
the
foundation
for
finding
that
the
acts
within
the
six
months
are
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
so,
our
question
is
whether
the
six-month
period
of
limitations
precludes
reliance
upon
a
barred
unfair
labor
practice
as
the
foundation
for
finding
their
conduct
within
the
six-month
period
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
bernard
dunau
our
position
is
that
once
the
six-month
period
has
gone
upon
an
unfair
labor
practice,
liability
for
that
unfair
labor
practice
is
extinguished
and
that
you
cannot
taint
later
conduct
in
reliance
upon
an
act
which
has
been
barred
by
limitations.
now,
what
happened
here?
in
july
of
1954,
the
company
requested
--
the
union
requested
the
company
to
recognize
it
as
the
bargaining
representative.
after
discussions
amongst
the
company
officials,
the
company
decided
to
extend
recognition
to
the
union.
and
so,
on
august
10,
1954,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
entered
into
between
the
company
and
the
union.
the
agreement
contained
a
conventional
recognition
clause
by
which
the
union
was
accredited
as
the
bargaining
representative.
it
contained
a
conventional
union
shop
clause
by
which
employees
were
required
to
join
the
union
within
45
days
of
employment.
it
contained
a
conventional
check-off
clause
by
which
the
employer
was
authorized
upon
the
individual
authorization
of
each
employee
to
check-off
union
dues
and
fees
and
to
remit
them
to
the
union.
the
agreement
was,
in
all
respects,
conventional.
it
contained
the
management
functions
clause.
it
provided
for
hours
in
overtime.
it
had
a
grievance
procedure
culminating
an
arbitration.
it
provided
for
a
five-cent
per
hour
wage
increase
immediately
and
it
deferred
increase
of
five
cents
within
four
months.
however,
the
board
found
that
on
august
10,
1954,
when
this
agreement
was
entered
into,
when
recognition
was
extended
to
the
union,
the
union
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
148
employees
who
were
employed
at
the
reading
plant
of
the
company
which
was
the
unit
covered
by
this
agreement.
about
a
year
later,
a
second
agreement
was
entered
into
between
the
company
and
the
union.
the
original
plant,
the
reading
plant,
it
had
been
planned,
would
operate
with
about
150
to
200
employees.
the
company
expanded
its
operations.
it
had
about
350
employees.
it
acquired
a
second
plant
about
12
miles
away
and
a
new
agreement
was
entered
into
which
enlarged
the
unit
to
cover
both
plants,
the
original
reading
plant
and
the
second
hillsdale
plant.
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
about
the
propriety
of
this
expansion.
that
is
conceded.
the
unit
properly
covers
both
plants.
the
agreement
was
altered
in
order
to
provide
for
seniority
in
the
two
plants
as
a
single
seniority
area
for
the
purposes
of
those
employees
who
had
in
--
been
employed
at
the
reading
plant
and
would
have
been
transferred
to
the
hillsdale
plant
to
man
that
plant.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
is,
i
think,
agreed
that
within
the
period
of
limitations,
the
union
at
all
times
represented
the
majority
of
the
employees.
there
is
no
--
i
cannot
say
that
there
is
a
finding
audit.
the
finding
runs
this
way,
that
no
majority
which
the
union
secured
subsequent
to
august
17,
1954
can
be
regarded
as
a
valid
--
no,
majority
which
the
union
secured
subsequent
to
august
17,
1954
can
be
regarded
as
a
valid
majority
because
of
the
original
entry
into
the
agreement
with
a
minority
union.
but
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct.
all
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
all
would
be
members
of
the
union
so
that,
within
the
six-month
period,
there
would
be
no
question
that
all
employees
were
union
members.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
i
will
not
say
--
no,
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
the
effect
of
that
conduct
had
exhausted
itself.
the
board
usually
finds
that
the
effect
continues
and
may
continue
for
an
indeterminate
period
until
an
order
is
entered
which
redresses
the
law.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
theory
is
that
once
the
will
of
the
employees
has
been
trammeled
by
unfair
labor
practices,
we
cannot
assume
that
anything
they
do
thereafter
represents
their
untrammeled
will
and
hence,
that
the
effect,
the
--
the
damage
to
their
free
choice
remains
uncured.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i
shall
try
to
demonstrate
that
if
--
in
the
course
of
the
argument
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
even
if
i
were
to
agree
that
the
effects
of
the
initial
unfair
labor
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
if
i
can
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
i
can
freely
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
there
was
nothing
subsequent
to
august
10,
1954
which
could
conceivably
be
regarded
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
there
was
no
human
intervention
subsequent
to
that
initial
act
which
can
be
regarded
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
the
employer
or
the
union.
mr.
bernard
dunau
unless
one
says
that
continuing
the
agreement,
in
effect,
executing
and
continuing
a
second
agreement,
in
effect,
in
other
words,
unless
one
says
that
maintaining
the
bargaining
relationship
after
its
inception
was,
itself,
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
six-month
period,
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
beyond
the
first
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
is
what
i
have
called
the
effect
of
the
unfair
labor
practice,
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
not
--
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
check-off
on
dues
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
dues
were
being
checked
off
pursuant
to
the
individual
authorization
of
each
employee
which
was
provided
for
in
the
agreement.
the
amended
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
the
check-off
was
not
compelled
because
the
check-off
simply
authorized
individual
employees
to
permit
the
employer
to
check-off
the
dues.
any
employee
who
decided
not
to
have
his
dues
checked
off
could
have
that
arrangement
and
pay
the
dues
himself.
however
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
the
payment
of
the
dues,
whether
by
check-off
or
directly
to
the
union,
was
contractually
compelled.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
when
one
says
membership
is
compelled,
one
really
means
only
that
the
payment
of
dues
is
compelled.
no
other
aspect
of
union
membership
can
be
enforced
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
so
that
union
membership
and
dues
payment
are
really
the
same
thing
under
the
statute.
now,
the
--
a
second
agreement,
as
i
have
said,
was
entered
into.
the
agreement
was
to
accommodate
the
acquisition
of
the
two
plants.
it
provided
for
a
wage
increase
of
31-cents,
15-cents
the
first
year,
8-cents
the
second
year,
8-cents
a
third
year.
other
adjustments
were
made
in
the
bargaining
relationship
to
correspond
to
a
year's
experience
under
the
contract.
now,
meanwhile,
on
june
10,
1955,
the
first
unfair
labor
practice
charge
in
this
case
was
filed.
for
our
purposes,
we
can
ignore
all
other
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
based
upon
that
charge,
a
complaint
was
issued
and
the
board
found
that
the
conduct
within
the
six-month
period
maintaining
the
first
agreement
in
effect
and
executing
and
maintaining
the
second
agreement
in
effect
for
unfair
labor
practices
and
that
it
was
free
to
rely
upon
the
initial
act
of
extending
recognition
and
contracting
with
the
union
which
had
occurred
more
than
six
months
before
to
tank
the
conduct
within
the
six-month
period.
now,
let's
test
that
first
by
the
words
of
the
statute.
if
you
count
back
six
months
from
june
10,
1955,
you
get
to
december
10,
1954
and
that's
your
six-month
line.
conduct
forward
of
that
is
properly
within
--
may
properly
be
adjudicated
by
the
board.
conduct,
in
fact,
of
it
is
barred
by
limitations.
if
you
take
the
conduct
forward,
as
i
have
said,
there
is
not
a
semblance
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
all
you
have
is
the
administration
of
an
agreement
valid
on
its
face.
all
you
have
is
the
execution
and
administration
of
a
second
agreement
valid
on
its
face.
the
agreements
providing
conventional
benefits
and
containing
conventional
union
shop
provisions.
so
this
completely
blameless
situation
forward
of
december
10
has
to
be
tainted,
if
it
is
to
be
tainted
at
all,
by
what
occurred
prior
to
december
10.
and
what
occurred
prior
to
december
10
was
more
than
six
months
before.
now,
what
happened
prior
to
december
10?
on
august
10,
1954,
the
union
did
not
have
a
majority.
that,
in
itself,
is
not
the
relevant
fact.
there
is
in
every
case
a
point
of
time
when
a
union
does
not
have
a
majority
and
is
in
the
process
of
procuring
one.
the
relevant
fact
is
that
at
a
time
when
the
union
did
not
have
a
majority,
exclusive
recognition
was
extended
to
it
and
this
fact
is
relevant
because
it
constitutes
the
unfair
labor
practice
of
assisting
a
union
and
abridging
a
free
choice.
now,
what
do
we
have
then?
we
have
this
unfair
labor
practice
on
august
10,
1954,
more
than
six
months
before
the
charge
was
filed.
this
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
was
filed
--
it
was
--
the
charge
was
filed
more
than
six
months
before
its
commission
and
section
10
(b)
could
not
state
more
plainly
than
it
does.
that
no
complaint
shall
issue
based
upon
any
unfair
labor
practice
occurring
more
than
six
months
before
the
filing
and
service
of
the
charge.
in
this
case,
the
complaint
is
based
upon
nothing
but
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
occurred
more
than
six
months
before
the
filing
and
the
service
of
the
charge.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
the
theory
is
that
the
statute
contemplates
that
a
bargaining
relationship
shall
not
be
entered
into
except
with
a
union
which
represents
a
majority
of
the
employees
and
it
means
an
uncoerced
majority.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct,
sir.
it
is
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
the
--
the
theory
is
that
the
damage
occurred,
the
--
the
trammeling
of
a
free
choice
continues
until
something
happens.
mr.
bernard
dunau
according
to
the
board,
unless
the
employer
withholds
and
withdraws
recognition,
at
least
until
the
board
certifies
the
union
after
an
election,
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
the
basis
for
the
notion
that
the
free
will
of
the
employees
has
been
trammeled
is
--
requires
a
finding
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
was
committed.
in
this
case,
it
requires
the
finding
that
the
company
and
the
union
entered
into
a
bargaining
relationship
when
the
union
had
no
majority
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
if
the
board
is
not
entitled
to
make
that
finding
because
limitations
have
run
upon
that
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
is
prevented
from
recognizing
the
consequence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
a
statute
of
limitations
which
extinguishes
the
liability
for
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
neither
can
we
decide
it
by
saying
that
because
the
consequence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
continues
with
the
--
within
the
six-month
period
that,
for
that
reason,
we
can
look
to
the
act
which
precedes
the
six-month
period
to
determine
the
cause
of
that
kinds
of
question.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i'm
sure
you
are
not,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
of
course,
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that,
of
course,
was
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
the
burden
of
my
whole
argument.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
you
cannot
look
to
the
effect
--
well,
as
i
said,
it's
the
burden
of
my
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
--
and
all
--
and
whether
we
call
it
one
or
the
other,
what
we
still
have
to
get
back
to
in
the
end
is
whether
this
10-month
--
this
six-month
period
of
limitations
bars
the
board
from
finding
the
initial
fact.
and
if
it
bars
it,
then
it
has
no
basis
for
saying
that
there's
anything
which
continues
that
there
is
any
operative
fact
within
the
six-month
period.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
and
i
shall
try
to
demonstrate
that
in
the
course
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
of
the
argument,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
there
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
time
limit
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
for
years,
your
honor,
and
i
will
cite
a
case
which
just
was
decided
relatively
recently
which
will
illustrate
precisely
what
i
mean.
there
is
no
time
limit
unless
the
six
months
provides
that
time
limit.
a
charge
was
filed
in
a
case
called
lively
photos,
inc.
three
years
and
eight
months
after
the
agreement,
the
first
agreement
was
entered
into.
the
basis
for
the
charge
in
that
case,
as
in
this
case,
was
that
at
the
time
the
agreement
was
first
entered
into,
the
union
had
no
majority
and
that
was
all
there
was
in
that
case
and
that's
all
there
is
in
this
case.
based
upon
that
charge
filed
three
years
and
eight
months
after
the
event,
the
board
almost
five
years
after
the
first
agreement
was
entered
into,
found
the
fact
to
be
that
the
union
had
no
majority,
entered
an
order
severing
the
bargaining
relationship.
so
in
that
case,
almost
five
years
after
the
first
agreement
was
entered
into,
the
board
still
said
the
momentum
persisted,
and
this
was
upon
the
basis
of
a
charged
file
three
years
and
eight
months
after
the
first
contract
was
entered
into.
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
was
a
board
case,
your
honor,
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
it
appears
on
pages
32
to
33
of
our
brief.
now,
this
is
logical
because
if
you
can
pierce
the
six-month
limitation
by
four
months,
there's
no
reason
why
you
cannot
pierce
it
by
three
years
and
two
months.
either
there
is
a
six-month
line
or
there
is
no
line.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
know
of
no
case,
your
honor,
that
has
been
adjudicated
in
which
the
board
has
ever
said
that
the
mere
lapse
of
time
alone
suffice
that
this
fail
any
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
it
is
possible,
of
course,
that
in
the
regional
offices
themselves,
when
charges
were
filed,
perhaps
complaints
are
not
issued
if
too
long
a
period
of
time
has
elapsed,
but
that
must
be
a
very
long
period
of
time,
indeed,
because
if
we
judge
from
a
recent
--
the
recent
lively
photos
case,
it's
five
years
at
least,
and
the
board
still
says
the
momentum
continues.
mr.
bernard
dunau
oh,
in
a
bargaining
situation,
the
case
before
the
court
is
the
first
one
in
which
they
pierced
the
statute
of
the
--
the
six-month
period.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
i
would
hesitate
to
say,
for
example,
that
if
in
a
unit
of
50,
the
employer
were
to
fire
5
or
10
per
union
activity,
that
the
impact
of
the
discharge
of
those
5
or
10
lasted
less
long
but
it
was
less
drastic
than
a
bargaining
relationship
entered
into
less
than
the
majority.
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
i
think
the
board
would,
if
i
recall
its
decisions
correctly,
place
considerable
more
emphasis
upon
the
--
a
discriminatory
discharge
as
having
a
momentum
than
the
other
way
around.
i
do
not
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
rule
is
that
if
he
has
not
filed
his
charge
within
six
months
of
his
dismissal,
that
is
barred.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
board
has
so
held
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
it
can't
be
regarded
--
if
--
that
is
not
the
explanation,
your
honor,
because
the
board
has
also
held
that
the
six-month
period
of
limitations
is
applicable
in
this
type
of
situation.
assume
a
union
is
company-dominated,
that
is
the
employer
has
assisted
it
by
such
unfair
labor
practices
that
the
board
says
this
is
the
company's
own
creature.
but
all
the
acts
which
prove
domination
occur
more
than
six
months
before
the
charges
filed.
the
board
holds
that
you
cannot
adjudicate
the
company
dominated
origin
of
that
union
if
the
charge
was
filed
more
than
six
months
after
the
events.
now,
certainly,
the
momentum
of
a
company-dominated
labor
organization
is
at
least
as
great
as
the
momentum
that
it
comes
from
a
bargaining
agreement
with
a
labor
organization
which
is
not
at
all
company-dominated.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
don't
understand
the
distinction.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
do
not
--
they
do
not
explicate
a
distinction,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
one
i've
just
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
those
are
given
in
our
briefs
at
pages
52
to
53.
judging
from
the
volumes
of
the
boards,
they
began
in
88
nlrb
which
would
have
been
shortly
after
the
1947
amendments.
i
have
a
case
which
is
108
which
would
be
around
52
or
53.
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
is
on
pages
52
to
53
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
and
there
are
other
situations
which
we
have
also
indicated
where
the
effect
of
the
conduct
or
the
consequence
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
as
a
continuing
one.
this
is
the
only
case
and
the
only
situation
which
the
--
i
know
of
that
the
board
says,
because
the
relationship
is
continuing,
the
six-month
period
does
not
run.
now,
if
that
is
true,
as
i
have
said,
not
only
is
there
never
a
period
of
time
for
which
repose
applies
to
a
bargaining
relationship.
it
is
impossible
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
to
fulfill
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
if
it
never
runs,
then,
as
the
house
report
put
it,
what
it
was
after,
what
the
congress
was
after
was
to
obviate
the
evil
of
delayed
litigation.
“after
records
have
been
destroyed,
witnesses
have
gone
elsewhere
and
recollections
of
the
events
in
question
had
become
dim
and
confused.”
this
is
the
conventional
pragmatic
justification
for
a
statute
of
limitations.
if
it
never
runs,
then
you
always
have
and
increasingly
have
the
risk
of
litigation
upon
the
basis
of
lost
evidence,
but
that
isn't
even
the
most
fundamental
consideration
because
more
fundamental
than
the
pragmatic
situation
of
lost
evidence
is
the
principle
of
repose
itself.
the
idea
is
that
if
a
period
of
time
has
elapsed
without
a
relevant
charge
or
complaint
or
proceeding
being
instituted,
the
status
quo
is
stabilized.
he
who
is
--
thinks
he
suffers
a
wrong
ought
to
be
diligent
to
enforce
it.
he
who
thinks
he
has
a
right
ought
to
be
--
he
who
suffers
a
wrong
ought
not
to
be
forever
under
the
anxiety
of
a
lawsuit
and
disruption
of
a
status
quo,
and
he
who
thinks
he
has
a
right
ought
to
be
diligent
to
enforce
it.
now,
this
was
a
dominating
purpose
of
congress
in
this
situation
because
the
six-month
period
itself,
by
its
very
shortness,
indicates
that
the
dominating
purpose
of
congress
was
to
bring
surcease
to
these
controversies
to
quiet
them
if
they
weren't
made
the
subject
of
a
charge
within
six
months.
well,
you
can
never
quiet
a
controversy.
you
can
never
validate
a
bargaining
relationship
if
though
more
than
six
months
has
passed
since
its
inception
and
though
the
only
thing
that
is
wrong
with
it
is
a
misstep
in
its
origin,
it
is
nevertheless
perpetually
vulnerable.
this
is
incompatible
with
any
concept
of
repose
that
a
statute
of
limitations
is
supposed
to
bring
about.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
first
agreement
had
a
two-year
term.
after
the
first
year
of
the
term,
it
then
had
--
the
second
agreement
was
entered
into
for
a
three-year
term,
and
that's
where
the
record
stops.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
suppose
that
the
board
would
say
--
well,
i
know
what
--
the
board
says
the
six-month
never
--
period
never
runs
so
long
as
the
initial
agreement
or
any
successor
agreement
remains
in
effect.
so,
so
long
as
you
have
a
continuing
bargaining
relationship,
the
six-month
period
never
runs.
now,
presumably,
if
there
were
a
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
not
relevant
under
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
so
long
as
there
is
a
second
agreement
which
succeeds
the
first
agreement,
yes,
sir.
so
long
as
there
is
any
bargaining
relationship
in
existence,
the
board
will
continue
to
hold
that
there
is
no
limitations
which
runs
on
that
relationship.
mr.
bernard
dunau
congress
had
in
mind,
as
it
said,
we
give
the
employee
or
anyone
else
who
feels
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
has
been
committed
six
months
within
which
to
file
the
charge.
if
the
charge
is
not
filed
within
that
period,
that
puts
an
end
to
the
complaint,
the
practice,
the
wrong
about
which
the
charge
of
--
would
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
board.
it
was
a
conventional
statute
of
limitations
that
congress
was
enacting
and
it
made
six
months
the
period
in
which
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
board
begins
the
repayment
order
six
months
preceding
the
filing
of
the
charge.
it
recognizes
the
working
of
the
statute
of
limitations
to
the
extent
that
it
will
not
require
the
refund
of
moneys
more
than
six
months
before
the
filing
of
the
charge.
but
its
seize
and
desist
orders
and
its
affirmative
orders
in
other
respects
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning
and
they
severe
the
bargaining
relationship
exclusively
upon
the
basis
of
the
act
which
occurred
more
than
six
month
before
the
charge
was
filed.
now,
actually,
congress
has
left
very
little
to
the
imagination
in
this
situation
because
the
senate
report
which
accompanied
section
--
which
explains
section
10
(b),
and
this
is
on
page
36
of
our
brief,
said
this,
“the
board
itself,
by
adopting
a
doctrine
of
latches,
has,
to
some
extent,
discouraged
adulatory
filing
of
charges
and
a
rider
to
the
current
appropriations
bill
which
it
--
which
if
this
amendment
was
adopted
would
no
longer
be
necessary,
contains
a
three-month
period
of
limitations
with
respect
to
certain
kinds
of
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
the
rider
to
the
current
appropriations
bill
which
the
senate
--
to
which
the
senate
report
referred
said
this
in
part,
“no
part
of
the
funds
appropriated
in
this
title
shall
be
used
in
any
way
in
connection
with
a
complaint
case
arising
over
an
agreement
or
a
renewal
thereof
between
management
and
labor
which
has
been
in
existence
for
three
months
or
longer
without
a
complaint
being
filed
by
an
employee.”
so
that
the
senate
report
referred
to
the
appropriations
bill
wrier
which
explicitly
said,
“if
three
months
go
by
without
a
charge
filed,
you
cannot
prosecute
a
complaint
over
that
agreement.”
now,
this
was
not
new.
this
limitations
rider
or
one
substantially
like
it
had
been
in
each
board
appropriation
act
since
1943.
so
that
for
four
years
preceding
the
--
the
adoption
of
a
general
statute
of
limitations
in
1947,
the
riders
to
the
board's
appropriations
act
had
barred
the
board
from
using
funds
to
prosecute
a
complaint
over
an
agreement
if
o
charge
had
been
filed
within
three
months
of
the
agreement
and
other
conditions
of
the
riders
were
met.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir,
they
don't
try
to
explain
away
this
history
in
this
way,
and
i
--
i
just
don't
know
how
they
explained
it
away.
as
i
understand
it,
they
say
something
like
this,
“we
--
a
--
the
six
months
does
not
run
with
respect
to
an
agreement
which
is
invalid
on
its
face.”
now,
this
is
a
separate
situation
from
the
one
we
have
here,
which
is
an
agreement
valid
on
its
face
but
invalid
because
there
was
something
wrong
with
its
inception.
and
then,
they
say,
under
the
limitations
riders,
the
--
the
period
would
have
run
even
as
to
an
agreement
valid
on
its
face
and
so,
they
conclude
the
limitations
riders
had
broader
scope
than
section
10
(b)
as
enacted
and
therefore,
we
cannot
look
to
the
limitations
riders
as
a
guide
to
what
congress
meant.
to
this
--
to
me,
this
makes
little
sense
because
the
one
thing
that
is
certain
about
this
limitations
rider
is
that
it
was
initially
adopted
in
1943
to
meet
just
the
situation
of
agreements
valid
on
their
face
which
were
entered
into
with
a
union
which
did
not
have
majority
support.
if
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
between
an
agreement
valid
on
its
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
that
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir,
that
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
drawn
by
interpretation
from
the
statute.
the
theory
is,
and
we
do
not
contest
this,
that
if
you
have
an
agreement
invalid
on
its
face,
you
do
not
need
anything
more
than
proof
of
that
agreement
to
show
an
unfair
labor
practice.
you
do
not
have
to
look
to
any
events
more
than
six
months
refiling
of
a
charge.all
you
have
to
do
is
introduce
the
agreement
into
evidence.
it
is
a
fact
existing
today
and
in
effect
today
and
therefore,
you
--
the
limitations
have
not
begun
to
run
on
it.
now,
the
only
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
a
closed-shop
agreement,
yes,
sir.
it
would
be
one
invalid
on
its
face.
all
you
have
to
do
is
you
introduce
the
agreement
and
you've
proven
your
case
and
it
is
not
a
reliance
upon
an
unfair
labor
practice
occurring
more
than
six
months
before.
it
is
in
existing
today
unfair
labor
practice
proved
by
the
existence
of
the
agreement
in
effect
today
and
on
its
face
today,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
doesn't
matter
when
the
agreement
was
entered
into.
and
the
only
relevance
of
the
notion
of
continuing
violation
in
such
a
situation
is
to
refute
the
defense
that
because
the
agreement
was
executed
more
than
six
months
before,
its
continuance
in
existence
is
barred
by
limitations.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
this
would
be
an
agreement
invalid
on
its
face
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
--
i
hasten
to
add,
not
an
agreement
which
would
be
within
the
competence
of
the
board
to
adjudicate
since
racial
discrimination
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
board
is
concerned
with.
the
conventional
invalid
on
its
face
agreement
with
which
we
deal
here
is
one
which
provides
for
union
security
in
excess
of
the
maximum
permissible
under
the
statute
which
would
be,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
one
which
had
a
closed-shop
provision
or
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
oh,
it
would
be
invalid
on
its
face.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
though
it's
invalid
on
its
face,
it's
not
the
kind
of
agreement
which
the
board
is
concerned
with
because
it
doesn't
redress
racial
discrimination
agreements.
it's
concerned
only
with
union
discrimination
agreements.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir,
it
doesn't
take
a
written
contract.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
still
think
it's
the
same
situation
because
whether
it's
the
written
contract
or
whether
it's
a
practice
which
has
--
and
being
without
a
written
contract,
you
still
have
to
go
back
to
the
inception
of
the
relationship
to
show
that
though,
let
us
say,
exclusive
recognition
was
granted
without
a
written
contract,
nevertheless,
the
only
thing
wrong
with
it
was
that
it
was
the
relationship
was
begun
with
a
union
which
did
not
have
a
majority,
so
that
the
writteness
or
the
oralness
of
the
arrangement
is
not
material
to
what
we
conceive
as
the
basic
factor
here,
namely,
that
you
still
have
to
go
back
to
a
barred
unfair
labor
practice
in
order
to
set
in
motion
any
kind
of
a
view
of
conduct
being
invalid
within
the
six-month
period.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
again,
it's
a
--
it
depends
upon
--
let
me
--
i
think
this
is
perhaps
the
argument
which
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
suggesting,
although
it
didn't
put
it
in
terms
of
the
written
or
oral
arrangement
and,
i
think
--
i
might
just
as
well
illustrate
what
i
think
is
very
--
what
is
just
lifting
one's
self
by
one's
own
bootstraps.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
dues
payment
and
union
membership
was
--
were
contractually
compelled.
and
this
contractual
compulsion
of
dues
payment
and
union
membership
occurred
within
the
six-month
period.
these
were
unfair
labor
practices
and
violations,
and
because
they
were
unfair
practices
and
violations,
the
board
was
permitted
to
go
behind
this
six-month
period.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
unfair
practices
and
violations
are
the
conventional
manifestations
of
the
administration
of
any
union
security
agreement.
every
union
security
agreement
contractually
compels
union
membership
and
the
payment
of
dues.
that
is
its
function.
that
is
precisely
what
is
permitted
to
a
union
security
agreement.
well,
you
can't
call
these
acts
unfair
practices
and
violations
in
order
to
justify
breaching
the
six-month
period
because
your
justification,
legal
justification
for
calling
them
unfair
practices
or
violations
only
occurs
after
you
have
already
breached
the
period.
in
other
words,
you
cannot
use
the
barred
unfair
labor
practice
as
your
reason
for
saying
“i
--
therefore,
i
can
look
at
it.”
that's
just
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
could
not
point
to
anything
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
the
--
it's
reasoned
in
this
fashion.
let
us
take
the
section
8
(a)
(2)
violation.
that
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
assist
a
labor
organization.
section
8
(a)
(1)
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
interfere
with,
restrain,
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
right
to
choose
a
bargaining
representative.
the
theory
is
that
when
you
enter
into
an
exclusive
bargaining
relationship
with
a
union
which
does
not
have
a
majority,
you
have
assisted
that
labor
organization
and
you
have
interfered
with
and
restrained
and
coerced
the
employees
in
the
exercise
of
a
free
choice.
there
is
nothing
more
specific
in
the
statute
than
that.
now,
as
i
have
said,
the
limitations
provision
seem
to
us
--
the
riders
to
the
current
appropriations
bill
or
the
appropriation
bills
seem
to
us
to
be
decisive
that
there
is
an
doubt
because
under
those
riders,
there
was
just
no
question.
this
was
the
board's
interpretation
and
application
of
the
riders.
this
is
what
the
--
was
plain
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
in
both
houses
when
those
riders
were
enacted.
if
three
months
went
by
without
a
complaint
being
--
without
a
charge
being
filed,
that
terminated
liability
or
--
no
complaint
could
issue
based
upon
that
agreement.
now,
what
the
board
has
to
be
saying,
therefore,
is
that
when
congress
enacted
a
six-month
period
of
limitations
applicable
to
all
unfair
labor
practices,
it
was,
at
the
same
time,
eliminating
the
already
existing
applicability
of
limitations
to
agreements.
we
do
not
think
this
is
a
possible
interpretation.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
three
months,
your
honor.
and
once
the
congress
enacted
the
general
six-month
period
of
limitations,
it
discontinued
the
appropriations
riders
--
the
riders
in
the
board's
appropriations
act
and
this
was
consistent
with
the
report
--
the
explanation
in
the
senate
report.
when
we
had
a
six-month
period
of
limitations,
the
riders
would
no
longer
be
necessary.
well,
under
the
board's
interpretation,
the
riders
continued
to
be
necessary.
now,
how
does
the
board
get
there?
it
gets
there,
first,
by
saying
section
10
(b)
is
not
a
rule
of
evidence.
it
is
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
we
agree.
it
also
says
section
10
(b)
does
not
preclude
receipt
in
evidence
of
events
which
transpired
before
the
six-month
period,
and
we
agree.
it
then
says,
because
we
can
receive
in
evidence
events
which
occurred
more
than
six
months
before,
we
are,
therefore,
free
to
adjudicate
this
conduct
within
the
six-month
period
exclusively
upon
the
basis
of
the
barred
unfair
labor
practice,
and
that's
where
we
part
company
because
the
receipt
in
evidence
of
events
which
occurred
more
than
six
months
before
has
always
been
subject
to
the
important
limitation
that
you
can
receive
such
evidence
for
background
purposes
only
but
you
cannot
give
that
evidence
independent
and
controlling
significance
to
find
that
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
six
months.
well,
here,
obviously,
the
initial
unfair
labor
practice
was
not
received
as
background
evidence.
it
doesn't
even
give
it
sufficient
scope
to
say
it
was
received.
it
was
given
independent
and
controlling
significance.
it
was
given
exclusive
significance
but,
for
that
unfair
labor
practice,
there's
nothing
within
the
six-month
period.
and
so,
upon
the
basis
of
what
the
board
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
themselves
said
with
respect
to
receipt
in
evidence
or
antedating
evidence,
we
agree
it
can
come
in
for
background.
it
didn't
come
in,
in
this
case,
for
background.
it
came
in
as
the
exclusive
basis
for
adjudicating
their
right.
now,
the
further
basis
upon
which
the
board
says
that
the
six-month
period
can
be
breached
is
that
this
is
a
continuing
violation.
well,
i,
in
part,
explain
the
concept
of
continuing
violation
that
is
we
can
adjudicate
a
complaint
valid
on
its
--
invalid
on
its
face.
therefore,
there's
--
we
can
adjudicate
with
one
valid
on
its
face
because
there's
no
difference
between
the
two.
we
think
there's
a
world
of
difference
between
the
two
because
with
one
which
is
invalid
on
its
face,
you
do
not
have
to
go
to
any
events
six
months
before
the
charge.
with
one
valid
on
its
face,
you
do
and,
because
you
do,
we
think
six
--
the
section
10
(b)
operates.
i've
also
explained
why
the
distinction
drawn
by
the
court
of
appeals,
namely,
that
these
are
unfair
labor
practices
or
violations
within
the
six-month
period
will
not
wash.
the
other
explanation
that
we
now
have,
and
this
is
the
third
variation
of
the
concept
of
continuing
violation
is
the
one
in
the
board
brief.
the
board
brief
says
that
we
agree
that
execution
of
the
agreement
is
barred
by
limitations
but
continuance
or
enforcement
of
the
agreement
is
not.
the
distinction,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
execution
of
the
agreement
is
a
completed
and
consummated
act
when
it
takes
place,
therefore,
limitations
run
as
to
it.
the
enforcement
is
not
a
complete
act.
it
is
a
continuing
act
and
therefore,
limitations
do
not
run.
what
it
seem
--
it
seems
to
us
that
what
this
contention
does
is
to
separate
the
consequence
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
from
the
unfair
labor
practice.
for
the
underlying
unfair
labor
practice
is
rendering
assistance
to
a
union
by
recognizing
and
contracting
with
it
when
it
does
not
half
a
majority.
the
consequence
of
that
unfair
labor
practice
is
to
invalidate
both
the
--
invalidate
both
the
execution
of
the
agreement
and
the
enforcement
of
the
agreement
to
say
that
the
limitations
run
as
to
the
execution
but
not
as
to
the
enforcement.
it's
to
have
your
period
of
limitations
run
from
the
result
of
the
wrong,
the
damage,
the
consequence.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
limitations
period
must
run
from
the
wrong
and
not
from
the
result.
if
one
is
hit
by
a
negligently
driven
car,
your
limitations
run
from
the
blow.
they
do
not
run
from
the
damages
of
--
disappearance
of
the
damages
as
a
result
of
the
blow.
if
one
has
a
permanent
injury,
it
surely
does
not
mean
that
limitations
never
run
during
the
light
of
that
dictum.
the
same
is
true,
it
seems
to
us,
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
consequences
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
linger
after
its
commission.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
offhand,
i
do
not
see
it.
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
there
is
none
but
offhand,
i
do
not
see
it.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
answer
to
the
labor
board's
argument
in
its
brief
was
stated
by
judge
simons
in
a
non-labor
board
case.
he
said,
“if
this
sort
of
an
argument
prevails,
if
this
were
not
true,
that
is,
if
limitations
did
not
run
from
the
wrong,
if
this
were
not
true,
in
every
case
where
damages
resulting
from
a
long
--
from
a
wrongful
act
are,
in
their
nature,
continuing,
there
would
be
no
limitation
upon
the
right
of
action
and
the
beneficent
purpose
of
the
statute
to
put
a
period
to
the
right
to
sue
would
be
defeated.
now,
we
didn't
cite
that
case.
if
the
court
would
like
to
see
it,
it's
73
f.2d.
333,
335.
it
seems
to
us
that
when
all
is
said
and
done,
what
--
what
--
one
gets
down
to
is
that
under
the
board's
view
of
section
10
(b),
limitations
never
run
on
a
bargaining
relationship
once
there
is
a
misstep
in
its
origin.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
it's
73
f.2d.
333
and
the
quotation
is
at
335.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
that
is
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
bernard
dunau
73
f.2d.
333
at
335.
it
seems
to
us
that
no
interpretation
of
a
limitations
provision
which
results
in
a
situation
where
it
never
runs
can
possibly
be
a
valid
interpretation
of
a
limitations
provision.
now,
if
we
are
right
as
to
this
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
your
honor,
if
that
were
sound,
then
the
board
was
wrong
when
it
said,
as
to
company-dominated
labor
organizations,
that
so
long
as
the
charge
was
not
filed
more
than
six
--
within
the
six
months
of
the
acts
which
created
the
dominative
character,
that
dominated
origin
of
the
organization
can
no
longer
be
adjudicated
because
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
whether
--
it's
not
simply,
for
example,
collecting
dues
on
behalf
of
an
organization
which
is
assisted.
any
act
by
a
labor
organization
in
its
role
as
exclusive
representative
is
a
wrongful
act
if,
in
fact,
that
labor
organization
has
no
right
to
operate
as
an
exclusive
representative.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
may
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
may
indeed
persist,
and
our
point
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i
repeat
what
i
have
already
said.one
has
no
right
to
say
that
any
act
in
effectuation
of
that
agreement
or
in
effectuation
of
the
bargaining
relationship
is
a
wrongful
act
unless
one
has
a
right,
first,
to
determine
whether
the
relationship
was
wrongly
conceived
in
the
first
instance.
if
one
has
no
right
to
determine
the
relationship
or
its
inception
in
the
first
instance,
one
has
no
basis
for
saying
that
the
operative
human
intervention
within
the
six-month
period
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
seems
to
us
that
no
matter
which
way
you
cut
this
baby,
you
still
come
back
to
the
primary
consideration
that
you
have
to
adjudicate
an
unfair
labor
practice
outside
the
period
and
you
still
come
back
to
what
i
think
is
what
is,
for
me,
the
conclusive
factor
that
on
this
reading
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
it
never
runs
and
i
cannot
conceive
that
that
is
a
sound
reading
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
now,
if
we
are
right
as
to
this,
that
ends
the
case.
if
we
are
wrong,
we
reach
the
question
of
remedy
which
i
fear
i
shall
have
no
time
at
all
to
discuss.
the
question
of
remedy,
however,
is
an
extremely
important
one.
the
board
says
that
when
the
board
ordered
the
company
and
union,
jointly
and
severely,
to
refund
to
the
employees
the
initiation
fees
and
dues
which
had
been
paid
by
them
to
the
--
which
have
been
checked
off
by
the
employer
pursuant
to
an
individual
check-off
authorization.
the
board's
theory
for
saying
that
the
money
should
be
refunded
is
that
when
employees
pay
money
pursuant
to
a
union
security
agreement,
they
are
paying
it
voluntarily.
but
for
the
union
security
agreement,
they
would
not
have
paid
the
money,
and
since
the
involuntarism
is
rooted
in
an
invalid
agreement,
we
have
a
right
to
require
the
refund
of
the
dues
and
the
fees.
now,
there
was
a
time
when
congress
acted
on
this
assumption.
there
was
a
time
when
congress
thought
that
dues
payment
pursuant
to
a
union
security
agreement
was
coerced
payment.
and
so,
in
1947,
it
provided
that
no
union
or
employer
could
enter
into
a
union
security
agreement
unless
an
election
had
first
been
conducted
amongst
the
employees
to
determine
whether
they
wish
to
authorize
entry
into
that
agreement.
about
four
years
later,
congress
repealed
that
provision.
it
is
now
permissible
for
an
employer
and
a
union
to
enter
into
a
union
security
agreement
without
an
election.
and
the
reason,
the
reason
for
the
repeal
was
simple.
it
was
the
experience
which
had
been
found
by
congress
during
the
intervening
four
years
in
which
such
elections
were
held.
over
46,000
such
elections
were
held.
over
five
million
employees
were
polled.
in
97%
of
the
elections,
the
--
the
employees
authorized
the
unions
to
enter
into
union
security
agreements
and
the
margins
of
victory
were
just
as
impressive.
they
ranged,
in
one
year,
from
87%,
to
another
year,
94%
and
so,
congress
was
persuaded
that
employees
do
not
involuntarily
pay
dues
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
a
union
security
agreement,
that
they
do
not
involuntarily
pay
them,
as
was
demonstrated
by
their
overwhelming
authorization
of
a
contractual
obligation
to
pay.
and
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
premise
upon
which
the
labor
board
acts
is
fundamentally
false
and
that
what
it
is
really
doing
is
not
remedying
the
wrong.
it
is
attempting
to
punish
its
commission.
it
is
attempting
to
coerce
compliance
by
a
staggering
financial
responsibility.
and
i
just
want
to
emphasize
this
by
telling
the
court
of
a
case
which
the
board
decided
on
december
28,
1959,
which
appears
at
45
labor
relations
reference
manual
1223.
the
board
has
finally
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
45
l.r.r.m.
1223.
it's
lummus
corporation,
l-u-m-m-u-s.
the
board
has
finally
said
what
has
been
painfully
obvious
for
a
long
time,
that
its
current
use
for
the
refund
order
is
not
to
remedy
a
wrong
but
to
prevent
its
commission,
to
deter
its
commission.
it
says
this.
“finally,
we
believe
that
a
mere
seize
and
desist
order
will
have
little
impact
in
an
industry
where
illegal
hiring
practices
are
widespread.
the
reimbursement
remedy
more
properly
effectuates
the
purposes
of
the
act
because
it
provides
not
only
a
deterrent
to
future
violations
but
an
incentive
to
future
compliance.”
what
the
board
is,
therefore,
doing
is
using
a
money
remedy
as
a
fine.
it
says,
“if
you
do
not
comply,
you
will
be
fined,”
and
there
is
no
necessary
relationship
at
all
between
--
between
the
wrong
for
which
the
refund
is
ordered
and
the
reason
that
the
board
is
ordering
the
refund.
mr.
bernard
dunau
unless
there
aren't
any
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
would
have
barred
this
charge
because
certainly,
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
the
--
actually,
no.
the
second
charge
--
i
believe
the
second
agreement
was
entered
into
after
the
second
charge
was
filed.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
dunau
one
charge
was
filed
in
june.
the
second
charge
was
filed
in
august.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct,
sir,
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
--
we
can
divide
it
into
two
parts.
the
board
made
one
finding,
namely,
that
maintenance
of
the
first
agreement
into
a
--
in
effect,
constitute
a
violation
of
the
act.
that
could
certainly
not
have
been
litigated
under
the
rider
because
it
--
the
charge
came
more
than
three
months
after
that
agreement.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
rider
said
a
renewal
can
be
--
a
renewal
agreement
can
be
attacked
within
three
months,
it
said,
“yes,
from
three
months
on
august
31st,
1955,
you
can
attack
that
agreement,”
but
i
do
not
think
it
said
at
the
same
time
that
if
your
evidence
necessary
to
attack
that
second
agreement
has
to
go
back
to
the
evidence
which
would
open
the
first
agreement,
and
you
were
barred
from
opening
the
first
agreement,
that
the
rider
would
not
have
protected
both
the
first
and
the
second,
otherwise,
on
the
renewal,
you
would
have
reopened
what
have
been
closed
by
the
first
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
does
not
bar
evidence,
your
honor,
except
if
you're
going
to
get
any
effect
either
to
the
riders
or
to
section
10
(b).
it
must
bar
the
substantive
unfair
labor
practice
which
precedes,
by
more
than
six
months,
the
charge,
else,
you
have
never
barred
the
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
you're
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
pro
--
yes,
sir,
it
is
different
because
under
the
rider,
there
is
no
possible
claim
that
you
there
--
under
the
rider,
you
have
to
file
your
charge
within
three
months
of
the
inception
of
the
agreement.
it
says
so
in
so
many
words.
now,
our
argument
is,
if
under
the
rider
you
have
to
file
your
charge
within
three
months
of
the
agreement,
we
cannot
understand
an
interpretation
of
section
10
(b)
which
replaces
the
rider
which
says
that
you
do
not
measure
the
limitations
from
the
inception
of
the
agreement
but
from
--
well,
you
don't
measure
it
from
anything
because
it
continue
--
it
never
runs.
mr.
bernard
dunau
what
we
draw
from
the
riders
and
all
we
draw
from
the
riders
is
that
when
congress
was
dealing
with
this
explicit
situation
of
an
agreement
valid
on
its
face
but
illegal
because
it
was
entered
into
with
a
minority
union,
it
started
its
limitations
period
running
from
the
date
the
execution
of
the
agreement
--
from
the
date
of
the
execution
of
the
agreement
and
the
board
always
understood,
even
after
the
1945
rider
was
enacted
which
had
the
renewal
language
in
it.
it
said
in
its
annual
reports,
“we
cannot
attack
an
agreement
once
the
three
months
has
expired
even
with
a
union
which
did
not
represent
the
majority
when
the
agreement
was
executed."
that's
what
we
draw
from
the
riders.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
1948
rider
is
a
totally
different
situation.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir,
but
it
was
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
if
--
we'd
have
a
wholly
different
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
1948
rider
was
enacted
subsequent
to
section
10
(b).
it's
a
meaningless
rider
the
way
it's
written
because
you
don't
need
a
rider
to
protect
an
agreement
entered
into
with
a
majority
union.
and
if
you
read
the
rider
--
the
1948
rider
literally,
that's
all
you
get
out
of
it.
you
get
nothing
from
it.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
true
explanation
of
the
1948
rider
is
that
this
whole
limitations
problem
had
already
been
settled
by
section
10
(b)
and
if
a
couple
of
senators
or
congressmen
wanted
to
enact
the
limitations
rider
having
a
different
policy
than
section
10
(b),
nobody
in
congress
was
interested
in
opposing
it
because
the
problem
had
already
been
settled
in
10
(b).
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
it's
significant
in
that,
as
a
date,
it
is
more
than
six
months
preceding
the
filing
of
the
charge.
that's
the
only
significance
i
draw
from
august
1954,
if
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
probably
not.
if
there
were
no
contract
at
all,
the
board
would
have
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
more
problems
by
way
of
proof,
but
i
don't
see
that
--
that
--
analytically,
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
contract
which
reports
the
relationship
is
reduced
to
writing
or
whether
the
relationship
is
a
practice
which
is
unrecorded
in
writing.
now,
what
we
always
get
back
to,
and
this
is
the
finding
of
the
board
from
which,
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
no
escape
of
where
we
must
begin,
this
is
a
product
contract
used
defensively,
all
kinds
of
--
of
verbalisms
have
been
resorted
to.
the
finding
is
explicit.
the
finding
is
that
at
the
time
the
company
and
the
iam
executed
the
august
1954
agreement,
the
unions
did
not
represent
the
majority
of
the
employees
covered
by
the
agreement
but
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
am
reading
from
page
10
of
my
brief,
your
honor,
which
cites
the
board's
relevant
finding
on
this
subject.
this
is
the
finding,
that
on
august
10,
1954,
the
company
and
the
union
entered
into
an
agreement
and
the
union
didn't
have
a
majority.
and
then,
we
have
the
crucial
finding
of
the
substantive
violations.
it
follows,
therefore,
and
we
find
that
the
company
violated
section
8
(a)
(1),
(2)
and
(3)
and
the
unions
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
(2)
by
maintaining
in
effect
the
1954
agreement
and
by
executing
and
maintaining
in
effect
the
1955
agreement,
both
of
which,
contained
unlawful
union
security
clauses.
but
what
the
board
was
doing
was
finding
that
the
agreements
constituted
unfair
labor
practices,
the
maintenance
in
effect
and
the
execution
and
maintenance
of
the
second
agreement.
not
defensively,
they
weren't
finding
unfair
labor
practice
upon
any
other
basis.
and
i
might
just
add
this,
your
honors,
the
union
security
provision
of
this
agreement
is,
in
this
case,
a
red
herring.
nothing
turns
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
a
union
shop
provision
in
this
agreement.
we
have
the
cases
cited
on
our
brief.
without
a
union
shop
agreement,
you
get
exactly
the
same
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(2).
as
the
board
has
stressed,
all
that
the
union
shop
provision
does
is
to
aggravate
the
violation.
it
accents
it.
but
the
violation
exists
with
or
without
the
union
shop
provision.
