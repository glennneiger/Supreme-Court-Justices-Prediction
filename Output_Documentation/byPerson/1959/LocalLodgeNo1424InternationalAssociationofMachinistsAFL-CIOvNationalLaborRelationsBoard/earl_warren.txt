chief

how
long
does
that
policy
prevails,
mr.
dunau?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean,
where
is
the
first
--
when
was
the
first
case
that
they
pierced
this
statute
of
limitation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that
case
decided,
mr.
dunau?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
you
just
told
us
about,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
come.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
a
new
theory
or
is
this
a
principle
the
board
has
acted
on
through
the
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice

warren
mr.
come,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
there
--
by
that,
do
you
mean
that
he
said
they
had
them
over
a
barrel
and
--
and
they
forced
him
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
--
reason
i
ask
that
is
because
the
next
question
was
what
--
was
anything
else
said?
answer
--
“was
anything
said
by
anyone
else
on
that?”
answer,
“well,
general
conversation.”
question,
“what
was
that
general
conversation?”
“they
wanted
to
crept
to
--
they
wanted
to
get
it
across
that
they
came
in
legal.”
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
get
across
to
us.
apparently,
not
that
they
had
not
gotten
them
over
a
barrel
and
coerced
them
into
do
it,
but
--
doing
it
but,
apparently,
that
they
--
there
were
some
relationship
that
made
it
legal
for
them
to
do
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
come,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
this
charge
had
not
been
brought
when
it
was
and
toward
the
end
of
this
three-year
agreement
that
they
had,
the
parties
entered
into
another
agreement
for
five
years,
based
upon
the
same
relationship,
and
nothing
was
done
there
until
toward
the
end
of
the
five
years
of
the
next
contract.
could
they
date
that
back
to
--
to
this
unfair
labor
practice
that
you
are
talking
about
and
--
and
avoid
those
situations
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
true.
well,
these
don't
--
these
don't
bother
about
how
difficult
it
would
be.
would
--
would
the
board
have
the
power
to
do
that
in
the
light
of
this
section
10
(b)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
--
before
we
get
to
that?
is
there
any
other
case
prior
to
this
one
in
which
the
board
has
delineated
this
policy
that
you
might
refer
us
to
or
is
this
the
first
time
that
--
that
they
have
done
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
its
face.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
believe
valid
on
its
face.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
in
your
brief,
mr.
come,
did
you
respond
to
the
citations
that
mr.
dunau
had
in
his
brief
one
of
these
company
unions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
didn't
distinguish
them
for
us
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
go
--
you
mean
going
to
write
a
brief
now
for
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
must
ask
for
the
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
