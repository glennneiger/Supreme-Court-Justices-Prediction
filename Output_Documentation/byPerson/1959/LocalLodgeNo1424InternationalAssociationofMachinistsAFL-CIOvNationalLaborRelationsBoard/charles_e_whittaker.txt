justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
correct,
however,
to
say,
mr.
dunau,
that
the
gravamen
of
the
action
was
the
making
of
that
contract
or
that
this
was
what
the
basis
upon
which
it
is
insisted
by
the
board
continuing
effects
within
the
six
months
became
unlawful?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
your
position
then,
that
the
limitation
is
one
of
extinguishment
or
one
of
limitations?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
any
evidence
of
finding
as
to
whether,
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
second
contract,
the
union
represented
the
majority
of
employees?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
it
then,
all
employees
who
had
been
hired
subsequent
to
the
original
time
track
fell
within
this
45-day
union
shop
provision.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
all
did
actually
then,
at
least,
paid
dues.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
see
--
let's
take
within
the
last
--
the
period
preceding
--
the
six-month
period
preceding
the
institution
of
this
--
this
charge.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
just
--
the
dues
are
being
checked
off.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
on
what
basis?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
compelled
by
it,
weren't
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
also,
membership.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
dunau,
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then
suppose
this
conduct
was
obviously
(inaudible)
as
to
whether
that
would
be
a
daily
violation
of
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
can't
conclude
that
this
very
conduct,
under
such
an
illegal
oral
understanding,
was
in
view
of
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
under
a
health
ordinance,
contract
of
this
kind,
payable
monthly
towards
(inaudible)
doesn't
the
cause
of
action
there
accrue
monthly?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
there
is
no
analogy.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
it
true
that
each
day
the
time
tracks
pose
longer
than
it
exists,
does
it
not
operate?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
one
time,
the
situation
is
(inaudible)
a
cause
of
action
is
barred
by
limitations
but
it
is
set
up
defensively
in
offset
of
an
affirmative
cause
of
action.
is
it
not
generally
the
law
that
this
action,
this
--
is
set
up,
no
barred,
may
be
proved,
in
diminution
or
offsets
of
the
affirmative
cause
of
action?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
not
disputed,
is
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
your
answer,
if
i
understand,
is
upon
the
maintenance
of
a
relationship
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
not
the
making
of
a
contract
so
you
can
go
except
the
record
you
(inaudible)
what
is
done
yet
to
be
(inaudible)
it
may
be
legally
justified
by
it,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
do
you
look
to
it
(inaudible)
at
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
come,
what
was
the
(inaudible)
and
you
drew
as
pertinent
to
this
contract,
and
they
do
it
defensively
to
show
the
justification
for
what's
done
today.
is
that
right
or
is
it
you,
the
board,
who
relies
on
the
contracts?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
the
invalidity.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
until
the
contract
is
asserted
defensively
and
the
justification
which
they
conduct,
there
is
no
such
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
dunau,
is
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
i
still
ask
him
a
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
of
any
significance
to
your
case
that
the
contract
was
made
in
august
1954?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
then
you
are
--
aside
from
that
fact,
just
as
well
off
as
though
there
were
no
contract
at
all?
