justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
position,
mr.
duanu,
that
whatever
illegalities
there
may
have
been
was
completely
exhausted
or
had
exhausted
itself
before
the
six-month
period
began
to
run?
is
that
the
essence
of
your
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
inanimate
--
so
inanimate
effect
in
nature
unrelated
to
what
you
mean
it
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
the
effect
continued?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
what
the
employer
did
preceding
the
six
months
continued
with
his
will
or
with
his
--
with
his
ascent
and
to
that
extent,
it's
collaboration
within
the
six-month
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
was
so.
suppose
you'd
agreed
to
my
statement,
would
it
be
outside
or
inside
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
effects.
the
effects
not
as
a
consequence
of
natural
phenomenon,
but
through
the
conscious
advantage
taking
of
what
preceded
the
six
months
continued
with
the
employers'
ascent
or
collaboration
and
to
that
extent,
participation
within
the
six
months
assumed.
and
i
think
that
is
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
some
human
intervention.
i'm
talking
about
human
intervention
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
merely
natural
phenomenon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
excluding
taking
advantage
of
what
has
been
done
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fruit
of
the
tree
doctrine,
you
say,
wouldn't
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
do
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dunau.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
us
what
the
theory,
the
philosophy,
the
reasoning
matters
of
industrial
relation?
what
theory
or
consideration
that
lie
behind
the
substantive
rule
whereby
the
board
is
authorized
to
direct
employer
to
undo
influencing
the
formation
of
an
organization
and
liberty
and
free
choice.
what
is
the
theory
behind
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
but
the
basis
of
the
order
of
the
board
to
undo
that
and
not
give
it
effect
starts
with
the
assumption
that
there's
a
momentum
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
does
the
damage
and
continues
its
--
its
illegal
influence,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
employer
must
take
affirmative
steps
to
undo,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
does
the
--
why
does
that
consideration
or
that
thinking
not
applied
to
this
kind
of
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
that's
what
--
your
statement
means
that
the
board
is,
as
a
--
by
rule
of
law,
prevented
from
recognizing
a
fact.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
--
that's
the
thing
that
we
have
to
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
he
can't
decide
it
by
assuming
it's
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
i
was
as
simpleminded
as
all
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
--
i
was
asking
why
the
consideration
that
leads
to
that
aggressive,
if
you
please
--
if
i
please,
rather
aggressive
power
authorized
to
the
board,
compelling
the
employer
to
take
affirmative
action
on
the
assumption
that
something
that
took
place
long
ago
persisted
and
therefore,
it's
still
operating.
that's
a
fact.
i
mean,
the
--
the
law
in
that
--
i
think
is
derived
from
the
experience
in
the
industrial
world.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
at
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
so
that's
what
i
call
a
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fact
of
industry.
i
want
to
know
why
that
type
of
industry
is
outlawed
by
a
rule
of
--
by
--
by
the
construction
you
give
to
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
why
i
say
you're
saying
that
something
that
in
fact
operates
within
the
six
months
may
not
be
considered
because
that's
the
way
the
statute
of
limitations
can
be
construed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
it
gets
down
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
call
it
the
effect
and
i
call
it
a
persisting
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
i
think
the
difference
in
our
statements
has
gone
to
this.
you
--
you
say
whether
the
--
whether
it
can
consider
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
preceded
the
six
months.
and
my
question
is
why
does
the
more
realistic
way
of
looking
at
things,
that
it
didn't
precede
but
continues?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
plain
meaning
of
section
10
(b)
bars
the
adjudication
of
this
complaint
for,
as
i
have
said,
there
is
nothing
in
this
complaint
but
an
unfair
labor
practice
preceding
the
six-month
period.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
purpose
of
the
limitations
period
requires
a
reading
in
accordance
with
its
plain
meaning.
now,
the
general
six-month
period
of
limitations
was
newly
enacted
in
1947,
except
for
an
important
area
which
i
will
come
to
presently.
there
were
no
limitations
in
effect
under
the
original
wagner
act.
now,
the
enactment
of
limitations
were
sharply
opposed
and
criticized
because
it
would
permit
unfair
labor
practices
to
go
un-redressed,
particularly
in
that
six
months
was
the
shortest
statute
of
limitations
known
to
the
law.
but
the
view
prevailed
in
congress
that
there
must
be
a
limitation
as
to
time
and
that
six
months
is
time
enough
within
which
to
bring
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
board.
well,
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
board
until
10
months
later.
that
was
four
months
too
long.
that
barred
the
act.
that
is
what
a
statute
of
limitations
means.
if,
in
this
case,
10
months
is
not
too
long,
then
20
months
is
not
too
long
and
30
months
is
not
too
long
and
40
months
is
not
too
long.
if,
in
this
case,
one
can
upset
a
bargaining
relationship
after
the
second
agreement,
there
is
no
reason
why
it
cannot
be
upset
after
the
third
agreement,
after
the
fourth
agreement
and
after
the
fifth
agreement.
and
i
am
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
time
--
time
period
had
the
board
acted
on
with
reference
to
the
substantive
provision
of
law
in
which
you
and
i
agree
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely
that
the
momentum
must
be
affirmatively
start.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
for
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
a
board
case
or
a
board
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
others
--
of
course,
there
are
different
kinds
of
unfair
labor
practices,
if
you
fire
an
employee
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you've
got
a
very
different
situation.
it's
a
much
more
isolated
phenomenon,
isn't
it?
so
you
said
it
out
of
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
it
out
of
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
hesitate
to
overrule
the
board
in
making
the
finding
to
that
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
--
i
didn't
mean
as
to
recognizing
the
union
but
as
to
the
effect
on
the
union,
but
as
to
reinstating
the
employee
on
--
on
his
complaint
after
a
six-month
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
and
the
board
has
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there
is
a
--
that's
precisely
the
--
i
didn't
know
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
ruling,
but
i
had
assumed
that
would
be
so.
the
difference
between
an
isolated,
enclosed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
situation
such
as
firing
john
smith
and
having
him
sue
non
--
to
bring
--
bring
proceedings
then
on
plaintiff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
distinction
they
make
through
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
page,
mr.
dunau?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
stop
running
or
it
--
it
may
begin
to
run,
as
it
were,
because
the
force
of
the
compulsion,
it's
a
totally
different
question,
may
have
ceased
to
operate
so
that
when
the
employer
says
“i'll
give
you
a
job,
provided
you
join
a
union,”
which
union
has
come
into
being
not
for
free
choice
and
the
involuntariness
of
the
organizations
still
persist,
it
isn't
merely
a
consequence
that
run
but
it
is
the
position
of
the
employer
saying
“i
won't
give
you
a
job
unless
you
join
this
congenitally
illegal
enterprise.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mind
saying
that's
the
most
impressive
part
of
your
argument
and
i'm
waiting
to
hear
before
you
explain
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
no
right
to
operate
may
persist
so
it
origin
merely
--
may
merely
persist
although
its
origin
may
be
outside
of
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
precede
the
six
months.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
it
persists
and
the
employer
insist
upon
the
subjection
of
that
illegality
to
its
employment
policy,
then
you
haven't
got
just
a
natural
operation
of
nature
but
you've
got
the
in
dimensionally
human
being
say
“i
won't
give
you
this
job
unless
you
do
something”
which,
by
your
answer,
has
obtained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
good
for
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
good
occasionally
to
go
back
to
the
terms
of
a
statute
in
which
we
are
concerned.
the
statute
says
based
upon
any
unfair
labor
practice
occurring.
justice
felix
frankfurter
occurring.
and
i
take
it
your
task
is
to
convince
this
court
that
things
occurred
during
the
six
months
--
within
the
six
months
not
merely
that
it's
interpreting
what
did
occur,
you
can
draw
on
what
preceded
the
six
months.
now,
what
occurred
--
the
mere
fact
that
the
contract
runs
isn't
an
occurrence
and
that's
it,
is
it?
the
mere
fact
that
the
contract
subsists,
could
you
call
that
an
occurrence
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question?
you
indicated
yes,
the
mere
fact
that
the
contract
prevailed.
i
wouldn't
call
that
an
--
something
occurring.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
the
contract
subsisted,
it's
still
there,
a
piece
of
paper,
no
modification,
no
repudiation,
no
nothing,
nothing's
going
up
but
the
employer
didn't
collect
the
check-off
and
nothing
was
done
about
it,
it
was
foregone,
you
wouldn't
say
that
there
was
something
of
occurring
then,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
--
if
the
employer
refuse
to
employ
somebody
who
refused
to
join
the
union,
that
was
company-dominated
union,
if
it
took
a
step
of
refusing
employment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
would
be
just
the
same
kind
of
an
occurring
as
check-off
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
an
occurring.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
cases
--
are
there
cases
in
which
a
company
union,
concededly
a
company
union
was
operating
in
the
plant,
who
is
in
the
plant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
was
taken
by
the
employer
to
enforce
obedience
to
that
arrangement
with
this
company
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant,
just
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
one
in
your
brief
where
that
has
been
done
with
reference
to
a
company
union
as
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
would
you
call
my
attention
to
them
so
i
can
see
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
does
the
--
in
the
memorandum
in
which
you
submit
that,
would
you
make
your
observations
on
the
cases
to
which
mr.
dunau
refers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
company-dominated
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
agree
that
you
have
to
have
what
--
in
order
to
have
an
occurring,
an
intervention
by
the
employer
of
some
sort
or
other
and
not
merely
that
the
subsistence
is
something
that
began
prior
to
the
six
months?
do
you
agree
with
that
or
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is,
if
i
understand
you,
that
when
an
employer
compels
a
union
--
tells
his
employees
to
--
to
give
up
the
check-off
or
--
check-off
to
put
into
the
security
fund,
etcetera,
that's
--
that's
a
neutral
act
and
what
you're
doing
is
to
illuminate
what
that
means
as
to
--
for
what
purposes
and
what's
the
meaning
of
that
--
of
that
conduct.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
when
it
comes
to
finding
out
what
an
ambiguous
or
a
neutral
act
is,
you
can
resort
to
evidence
which,
in
and
of
itself,
would
not
furnish
a
cause
of
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
do
something
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
you
do
something,
you
do
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
want
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
you
arguing,
in
effect,
that
through
the
active
enforcement
of
the
1954
agreement
within
the
statutory
period,
the
1954
agreement
has
made
a
continuing
unfair
labor
practice
just
as
an
innocent
overt
act
may
continue
a
conspiracy
to
demand
people
in
jail
or
the
conspiracy
itself
has
been
outlawed
and
nothing
remains
except
this
innocent
overt
act
which
pose
the
agreement
into
the
requisite
statutory
period?
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
the
original
illegality
is
a
continuing
illegality
and
saying
that
an
isolated
act
within
the
statutory
period
is
a
new
unfair
labor
practice.
they
are
different
things.
it
may
come
to
the
same
result
but
i
think
the
analyses
are
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this.
quite
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
legislative
history,
more
particularly,
the
--
the
reference
to
the
rider
in
senate
report
105?
and
i
ask
that
because
the
board,
in
construing
this
--
in
dealing
with
this
problem
and
recognizing
the
novelty
of
it,
as
they
did
in
terms,
don't
seem
to
discuss
the
legislative
history
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
repealed
section
10
(b)
if
it
doesn't
accept
the
application
and
the
report
indicating
it
has
--
should
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
i'm
a
little
confused.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
can
clear
me
out.
a
few
times
in
mr.
dunau's
brief,
he
said
also,
the
house
report
no.
105
and,
i
gather,
that
report
dated
april
17,
1947.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
it
refers
to
the
current
appropriations
within
the
three-month
period.
the
rider
to
the
then
current
appropriations
bill
to
which
the
senate
report
referred
has
this
provision
which
has
been
in
existence
for
three
months
or
longer
without
complaint.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
at
the
time
this
report
was
written,
the
rider
had
been
watered
down.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
rider
are
you
referring?
it
can't
be
the
rider
that
the
senate
report
was
referring
to
because
i
gather
that
mr.
dunau
wants
me
to
believe,
wants
me
to
assume
that
the
rider
referred
to
in
this
report
no.
105
is
the
one
he
sets
forth
on
page
36,
and
that
isn't
any
watering
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
--
was
that
true
of
the
rider
of
which
--
which
the
next
record
given
on
page
36
of
his
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
this
company.
it
doesn't
give
any
indication
that
there
was
anything
there
except
for
these
quotes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
borne
in
violation.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
44,
all
right.
all
right
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
regard
the
valid
--
the
--
the
1945
contract
year
as
a
renewal
--
the
second
contract,
the
1950
(inaudible)
i
beg
your
pardon.
do
you
regard
that
as
a
renewal
within
the
term
of
the
rider?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
are
to
get
--
if
we
are
to
get
illumination
from
the
reference
to
the
rider
in
the
senate
report,
the
illumination
must
be
from
the
totality
of
the
rider
and
not
a
part
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
the
fact
that
they've
been
operating
10
months
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
the
orders
in
which
this
court
had
sustained,
telling
the
employer
to
take
affirmative
measures
to
undo
what
he
had
properly
--
illegally
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that's
what
this
court
has
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
attacks
the
matter
that
as
a
matter
of
evidence,
if
it's
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
the
renewal
revives
or
continues
the
original
illegality
that
you
can't,
as
a
matter
of
evidence,
resort
to
--
to
that
which
substantively
is
barred.
in
other
words,
if
the
statute
of
limitations
may
bar
a
cause
of
action
but
it
doesn't
bar
other
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
--
and
you
say
i
can't
read
the
riders
to
say
that
the
renewal
sustained
and
continues
in
light
of
the
original
agreement
and
therefore,
the
effective
--
the
--
the
base
point
for
--
as
a
matter
of
time,
is
the
renewal.
they're
not
the
original
that
which
is
renewed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
incorporate
it
in
the
committee
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no?
