mr.
charles
j.
bloch
may
it
please
the
court.
the
day
i
left
georgia
last
saturday,
we
received
the
reply
brief
from
the
government
which
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
yet
to
answer
and
i
would
like
permission
to
file
a
reply
to
that
reply
brief.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
10
days.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i'll
get
it
here
just
as
fast
as
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
but
for
fear
that
i
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
do
not
get
it
here
in
time,
mr.
--
your
honors,
i
want
to
call
attention
to
one
thing
in
there
and
that
is
an
error
in
our
original
briefs.
in
our
original
brief,
on
page
34,
about
the
3,
4,
5,
6,
7,
8,
9,
10,
11,
11th
or
12th
line
from
the
bottom
of
the
page
on
page
34,
there's
a
quotation
mark
after
the
word,
“attributes.”
the
government
calls
attention
in
its
reply
briefs
to
the
fact
that
that
quotation
is
misplaced
and
it
is.
through
an
error
of
--
stenographic
error
or
the
printer,
i
don't
know
which.
the
quotation
mark
should
be
after
the
word,
“modifications.”
and
i
thought
at
the
outset,
i
should
call
the
--
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
criticism
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general
of
that
misplaced
quotation
mark
is
correct.
to
please
the
court,
that
it
is
seemed
to
us,
in
the
preparation
of
this
case
that
they
are
presented
by
this
appeal,
three
salient
questions.
first
is
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957,
appropriate
legislation
to
sort
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
secondly,
are
the
appellees
here
in
such
position
that
they
have
a
standing
to
challenge
the
alleged
invalidity
of
the
act
of
1957.
and
thirdly,
a
question
which
seems
to
me
to
permeate
the
whole
case
are
the
acts
complained
of
by
idea
of
attorney
general
or
the
pleader
in
the
complaint
in
the
district
court,
do
those
acts
constitute
any
--
an
abridgment
or
denial
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
georgia
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
negro
citizens
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
or
don't
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
show
that
those
alleged
acts
on
the
part
of
mr.
raines
and
the
other
registrars,
if
taken
as
true
as
we
must
on
the
motion
here,
of
their
individual
acts
and
not
an
abridgment
or
denial
in
any
constitutional
rights
of
these
colored
people
by
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i'm
sorry?
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
no,
sir.
i've
–
i
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i
devoted
about
half
a
three
quarters
of
a
page
to
that
question
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
--
in
the
brief,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
question,
but
what
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
appeal.
i,
at
one
time
thought
that
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
government
had
injected
into
the
case,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
--
these
people
had
the
standing
to
challenge
that
that
was
the
primary
question
and
not
the
constitutional
question,
but
i
think
they're
so
related
that
under
1252,
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
i
was
about
to
say
that
as
a
corollary
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
acts
complained
of
here
are
the
acts
of
the
state
of
georgia,
whether
the
actions
of
these
individuals
were
denials
--
constituted
denials
or
abridgments
by
the
state
of
georgia,
maybe
further
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
the
state
of
georgia
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
correct
these
alleged
wrongful
acts.
and
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia,
if
the
averments
of
this
complaint
are
true,
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia
provide
an
ample
judicial
remedy
by
which
the
alleged
wrongful
act
of
these
registrars
could
have
been
tested
in
the
georgia
courts
and
we
take
the
position,
your
honors,
that
that
isn't
a
question
of
exhaustion
--
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
but
we
take
the
position
that
aside
from
any
other
question
in
this
case
that
until
the
courts
of
georgia
had
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
alleged
discriminations
of
mr.
raines
and
these
other
gentlemen,
that
there
has
not
and
cannot
have
been
any
abridgment
or
denial
by
the
state
of
georgia.
now,
to
go
back
to
the
first
question,
is
the
--
the
legislation
that
we
assailed
and
that
judge
davis
held
unconstitutional,
is
it
appropriate
legislation
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
now,
to
--
to
answer
that
question
or
to
--
to
try
to
answer
it,
i
think
it's
important
that
we
first
go
back
to
the
state
of
the
law
--
the
state
of
the
statute
law
as
it
was
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957.
back
in
the
reconstruction
days,
there
were
a
great
many
civil
rights
acts
passed,
various
parts
of
them
were
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
cruikshank,
the
civil
rights
cases,
united
states
against
harris
and
united
states
against
reese
and
other
cases.
but
there
remained
one
section
which
was
carried
forward
from
year
to
year
and
when
the
united
state
code
was
adopted,
it
appeared
in
the
united
states
code
under
title
42,
section
1971.
now
that's
an
exact
reading,
your
honors,
of
the
exact
language
of
that
section,
is
most
important
in
the
consideration
of
the
problem
that
we're
discussing.
section
(a)
of
42-1971
which
the
distinguished
--
my
distinguished
friend,
the
attorney
general,
contends
--
comprehends
state
action,
so
to
speak,
is
this,
“all
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
otherwise
qualified
by
a
law
to
vote
at
any
election
by
the
people
in
any
state,
territory,
district,
county,
city,
parish,
township,
school
district,
municipality,
or
any
territorial
subdivision,
shall
be
entitled
and
allowed
to
vote
at
all
such
elections
without
distinction
of
race,
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
any
constitution,
law,
custom,
usage
or
regulation
of
any
state
or
territory
or
by
or
under
its
authority
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
now,
the
primary
disagreement
between
counsel
for
the
government
and
counsel
for
the
appellees,
the
registrars,
from
the
inception
of
this
case
almost
has
been
whether
that
old
law
which
is
carried
forward
into
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957,
whether
that
old
law
comprehended
only
an
abridgment
or
denial
by
a
state
or
to
use
the
colloquial
phrase
it's
grown
up,
contemplated
the
state
action.
well,
we
respectfully
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
language
of
that
statute,
that
original
statute,
is
broad
enough
to
cover
private
action,
the
action
of
private
individuals.
now,
all
that
can
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
were
these
people
acting
as
private
citizens?
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
they
were
acting
--
i
should
say,
they
were
not
acting
as
private
citizens.
they
would
not
have
had
an
opportunity
to
do
what
they
alleged
to
have
done
if
there
hadn't
been
county
register,
if
there
haven't
been
registrars.
but,
mr.
justice,
as
i'll
presently
show
you
in
another
face
of
it
or
i
can
now,
if
you
want,
the
averments
of
the
complaint
are
rather
important
right
at
that
juncture.
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
complaint,
it
appears
in
the
record
starting
at
page
1
and
it's
–
it's
important
from
two
aspects,
not
only
with
respect
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
douglas
just
asked,
but
with
respect
to
this
question.
if
you
don't
mind,
sir,
i'll
allude
to
this
first,
and
then
come
to
your
question.
what
are
the
right
--
what
is
the
right
conferred
by
that
section
(a)
alone?
now,
your
honors
will
notice
that
there
isn't
any
sanction
or
there
haven't
been
prior
to
1957.
it
was
a
declaration
of
the
right
of
citizens
without
any
penalty
for
its
violation,
without
any
sanction
attached
to
it
at
all.
now,
that
it
comprehended
individual
action,
as
well
as
acts
which
might
comprise
denials
or
abridgment
by
the
state,
is
shown
by
the
very
construction
which
the
government
gives
to
that
section
(a)
in
the
very
first
paragraph
of
its
complaint
in
the
court
below.
the
government
there
says
this
action
is
brought
under
part
4
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957
to
obtain
preventive
relief
against
acts
and
practices
by
the
defendants
which
would
deprive
other
persons
the
rights
and
privileges
secured
by
subsection
(a)
of
42
u.s.c.
1971,
namely,
the
right
and
privilege
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
otherwise
qualified
by
law
to
vote
at
any
election
by
the
people
in
the
state
of
georgia
to
be
entitled
and
allowed
to
vote
in
--
at
all
such
elections
without
distinction
of
race
or
color.
in
other
words,
your
honors,
the
government
admits
in
the
very
first
paragraph
of
this
complaint
which
was
passed
on
by
his
honor,
judge
davis,
that
the
right
conferred
by
that
old
statute
of
1870
was
not
the
right
to
be
secure
in
being
entitled
and
allowed
to
vote
from
interference
from
deprivation
from
abridgment
by
the
state,
but
the
very
broad
right
of
being
permitted,
entitled
and
allowed.
that
word,
“allowed”
means
something.
entitle
and
allowed
to
vote
at
any
such
election
without
distinction
as
to
race
or
color.
snow,
the
government
takes
the
position,
and
has
all
through,
i
believe,
that
the
use
of
the
phrase
by
the
congress
of
1870
of
thereabouts,
without
distinction,
any
constitution,
law,
custom
usage,
or
regulation
of
any
state
or
territory
or
by
or
under
its
authority
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
that
the
use
of
that
phrase
demonstrates
that
only
state
action,
abridgment
or
denial
by
the
state,
was
contemplated
in
that
statement
of
principle.
now,
we
have
violently,
all
the
way
through,
disagreed
without
–
with
that
construction
and
convince
the
court
that
our
disagreement
below
--
that
our
disagreement
was
correct
because
the
court
so-construed
that
1971
(a)
is
to
comprehend
individual
action,
as
well
as
abridgments
or
denial
by
the
state.
now
furthermore,
that
construction
--
our
construction
of
this
--
of
that
section
(a)
is
proven
to
be
correct
by
the
fact
that
when
the
gentleman
in
the
department
of
justice,
who
say
where
he
may
have
been,
came
to
draw
this
complaint
upon
which
this
action
is
based.
he
was
not
content
to
rely
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
lunch
hour
--
the
commencement
of
the
lunch
hour,
i
was
about
to
state
that
if
section
(a)
of
the
present
statute
means
only
state
action
or
means
only
acts
which
constitute
an
abridgment
or
denial
on
the
part
of
a
state,
i
can't
help
but
wonder
why
it
is
that
the
drafter
of
the
complaint
in
this
case
thought
it
necessary
to
allege
in
paragraph
3
of
the
complaint,
appearing
at
page
2
of
the
record.
“defendants
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
while
discharging
the
duties
of
the
officers
aforesaid,
were
acting
under
color
of
law
of
the
state
of
georgia.”
now,
your
honors,
if
--
if
section
(a)
of
the
act
contemplates
only
deprivations
or
abridgments
by
a
state,
why
was
it
necessary
for
the
pleader
to
allege
in
this
complaint
that
these
defendants
were
acting
under
color
of
law
of
the
state
of
georgia?
if
--
if
time
permits
or
certainly,
when
your
honors
have
occasioned
the
opportunity
to
read
the
statute
in
--
in
full,
your
honors
will
notice
that
that
phrase,
“color
of
law”
is
not
used
in
section
(c)
or
(d)
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957.
the
only
time
that
that
phrase
occurs
in
the
act
of
1957
is
in
section
(b)
wherein
it
is
stated
that
whether
or
not
the
acts
were
under
color
of
law,
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
in
connection
with
section
(c),
but
we're
not
concerned
with
that
section
(b)
here
because,
as
the
attorney
general
pointed
out
in
his
opening
argument,
that
subsection
has
to
do
only
with
federal
elections.
now,
your
honor
is
coming
to
the
question
which
was
propounded
before
the
recess
by
his
honor,
justice
douglas,
as
apprentice
to
that,
may
i
point
out
that
in
the
--
as
a
prentice
to
an
answer
to
it,
may
i
point
out
that
in
the
attorney
general's
opening
argument,
he
referred
to
the
comprehensive
plan
of
these
defendants.
comprehensive
plan
of
these
defendants
and
if
i
understood
the
attorney
general
correctly,
he
also
said
that
these
defendants
arbitrarily
refuse
persons
qualified
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia.
now,
furthermore,
sir,
in
the
complaint
--
in
the
complaint
in
many
places
that
are
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
specifically,
many
places,
is
it
alleged
that
these
actions
which
must,
if
there's
a
case
here,
which
must
constitute
a
denial
or
abridgment
by
the
state
of
georgia.
that
these
actions
fairly
construed
were
those
of
these
defendants
as
individuals
proceeding
directly
contrary
to
the
laws
of
georgia.
now,
for
instance,
on
page
3
of
the
record,
in
paragraph
9,
“on
and
after
the
times
defendants
assume
their
offices,
they
have
engaged
doctrine
and
are
continuing
to
engage
in
acts
and
practices
designed
and
intended
to
deny
the
right
to
vote
to
negro
citizens
of
the
state
of
georgia.”
then,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
pages
--
page,
occurs
the
word,
“arbitrary
refusal”
and
then,
“discriminatory
application.”
now,
most
important
to
me,
on
the
next
page,
said
acts
and
practices
were
and
are
further
designed
and
intended
by
the
defendants
to
perpetuate
the
disparity
referred
to
in
paragraph
5
between
the
registration
of
white
citizen
and
negro
citizen
in
the
state
of
georgia.
and
further,
it's
alleged
in
the
complaint,
on
page
5
of
the
record
that
the
delay
was
not
accidental,
but
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
them
of
their
right
to
vote.
on
page
6,
in
paragraph
14,
that
the
defendants
were
arbitrarily
and
without
legal
cause
and
solely
for
racial
reasons,
prevented
by
said
defendants
from
demonstrating
their
ability
to
write
correctly.
and
on
page
7
again,
arbitrarily
and
without
legal
cause,
in
paragraph
16
and
again
defendants,
in
the
administration
of
the
literate
test,
have
applied
different
and
more
stringent
registration.
and
finally,
in
paragraph
18,
there
on
page
7,
“the
application
of
different
standards
by
defendants
of
the
aforesaid
was
not
accidental,
but
was
designed
and
intended
by
them.
a
statute
of
the
state
of
georgia?
no.
contention
of
the
state
of
georgia?
designed
by
these
defendants
and
intended
by
them
to
discriminate.
now,
where
does
that
lead
us?
the
question
propounded
from
the
bench
indicates
that
simply
because
as
are
--
indicates
that
it
may
be
said
that
simply
because
these
men
were
state
officers
performing
a
duty
required
by
the
state
law
at
the
time
that
whatever
they
did
even
though
they
violated
these
command
--
the
statutory
command
of
the
state
of
georgia,
that
whatever
they
did
when
a
person
came
in
to
register
would
constitute
an
abridgment
or
denial
by
the
state.
the
state's
passed
a
statute
that
says
what
these
defendants
or
what
these
appellees
--
what
these
registrars
shall
do
in
the
administration
of
the
registration
laws.
that
statute
appears
as
an
appendix
--
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
it
also
appears
in
--
in
the
record
and,
i
think,
i
counted
here
this
morning
17
times
the
word,
“shall”
occurs
in
that
statute.
now,
when
the
state
of
georgia
solemnly
adopts
a
statute
and
says
those
who
are
charged
with
administering
that
statute,
shall
do
certain
things,
can
it
be
considered
as
an
abridgment
or
denial
of
constitutional
rights
by
the
state
of
georgia
when
alleged
individuals
allegedly
design
practices
of
their
own
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia?
where
is
the
abridgment
or
denial
on
the
part
of
the
state,
merely
because
the
men
happened
to
be
state
officers
at
the
time?
well
now,
that
question
was
answered
by
this
court
many
years
ago
in
the
--
in
the
barney
case,
barney
against
the
city
of
new
york.
now,
if
right
striking
that,
in
that
barney
case,
the
distinguished
counsel
for
mr.
barney
was
mr.
maxwell
evarts.
and
he
argued
before
this
court,
“this
question,
however,
whether
the
acts
of
the
transit
authority
is
--
of
the
city
of
new
york
were
actions
of
the
state
or
not,
this
question
however,
is
no
longer
open
for
argument.
any
act
of
an
agent
of
a
state
done
pursuant
to
the
powers
derived
by
him
from
the
legislature
and
by
which
of
his
public
position
as
such
agent,
whether
specifically
authorized
by
the
statute
appoint
him
--
or
him
or
not,
is
an
--
is
an
act
of
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
the
fact
that
the
rapid
transit
commissioners
have
some
duties
and
powers
in
the
construction
of
a
rapid
transit
railroad
does
not
commit
to
the
state
any
act
of
theirs
is
in
plain
excess
of
their
authority,
was
the
contrary
argument.
now,
the
court
there
in
193rd
u.s.,
held
that
the
acts
of
the
transit
authorities
of
the
city
of
new
york
did
not
constitute
an
abridgment
or
denial
by
the
state,
because
the
--
on
account
of
the
excess
of
the
authority
--
on
account
of
the
plan
designed
by
them,
it
ceased
to
be
any
act
of
the
state,
or
it
could
not
ever
have
become
an
act
of
the
state.
now,
is
barney
still
the
law?
it's
urgently
contended
by
the
government
that
the
barney
case
was
impliedly
overruled
by
the
los
angeles
case
of
the
home
telephone
company
in
the
227
u.s.
and
in
this
reply
brief
most
recently
filed,
it
is
stated
that
we
have
not,
on
our
part,
filed
any
--
cited
any
case
since
the
227
u.s.
which
shows
that
the
barney
case
is
still
the
law.but
now,
the
--
the
government
has
never
referred
to
snowden
against
hughes.
and
we
allude
to
it
very
skimpily
in
our
brief,
but
snowden
against
hughes,
as
some
of
your
honors
now
sitting,
recall
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1943
or
1944.
it
so
happens
that
the
--
they're
only
three
justices
now
sitting
who
were
on
the
bench
at
the
time
snowden
versus
hughes
was
decided.
one
of
those
justices
used
this
language,
“but
to
constitute”
--
i'm
reading
from
page
16
of
that
opinion.
“but
to
constitute
such
unjust
discrimination,
the
action
must
be
that
of
the
state.
since
the
state,
for
present
purposes,
can
only
act
through
functionaries,
the
question
naturally
arises
what
functionaries
acting
under
what
circumstances
are
to
be
deemed
the
state
for
purposes
of
bringing
suit
in
the
federal
courts
on
the
basis
of
illegal
state
action.
the
problem
is
dissent
with
inherent
difficulties
and
not
unnaturally,
it
had
a
fluctuating
history
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.”
and
then,
the
justice
says
“compare
barney
with
raymond
versus
chicago
traction
company,
memphis
versus
cumberland
telephone
company,
with
home
telephone
and
telegraph
company
versus
los
angeles
which
is
a
case
so
urgently
relied
on
by
the
government.
and
then
comes
this
sentence
and
this
sentence
is
a
reason
i
detailed
at
some
length,
what
this
complaint
says
here.
it
is
not
to
be
resolved
by
abstract
considerations,
such
as
the
fact
that
every
official
who
purports
the
willpower
conferred
by
a
state
is
portend
to
the
state.
otherwise,
every
illegal
discrimination
by
a
policeman
on
the
beat
would
be
state
action
for
purposes
of
suit
in
the
federal
court.”
then
said
the
justice,
“i
am
clear
therefore,
that
the
action
of
the
canvassing
board,
taken
as
the
plaintiff
himself
acknowledges
in
defiance
of
the
duty
of
that
board
under
illinois
law,
cannot
be
deemed
the
action
of
the
state,
certainly
not
until
the
highest
court
of
the
state
confirms
such
action
and
thereby,
makes
it
the
law
of
the
state.”
i
agree
in
a
word
with
the
court
below
that
barney
versus
city
of
new
york,
193
u.s.
430,
is
controlling.
neither
the
wisdom
of
its
reasoning
nor
its
holdings
has
been
impaired
by
a
subsequent
decision.
now,
your
honors,
that
--
that
points
out
the
other
necessity,
too,
--
the
other
necessity
too,
of
considering
here
that
if
what
i
briefly
alluded
to
at
the
outset,
that
if
these
gentlemen
did
design
this
plan,
if
they
did
design
it
to
arbitrarily
--
so
as
to
arbitrarily
discriminate
against
negro
citizens,
we
have
statutes
in
georgia
which
give
these
applicants
a
right
to
appeal
to
the
superior
court
of
terrell
county,
georgia,
which
--
statutes
which
provide
that
those
appeals
shall
be
held
at
the
first
time
--
argued
at
the
first
time,
statutes
which
provide
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court.
i'm
sorry.
there
was
another
point
i
wish
to
discuss,
but
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
