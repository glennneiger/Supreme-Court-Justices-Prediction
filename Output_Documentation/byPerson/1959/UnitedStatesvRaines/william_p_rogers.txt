mr.
william
p.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
appeal
from
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
georgia
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
civil
rights
act,
or
at
least
the
major
portion
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957.
it
is
the
first
statute
passed
by
congress
to
protect
the
voting
rights
guaranteed
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
in
87
years.
this
present
case,
brought
in
the
name
of
and
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
is
the
first
case
under
that
act.
it
is
of
significance
not
because
there's
any
substantial
legal
problem
involved,
because
i
think
there
is
none,
but
rather
because
it
involves
the
basic
right
of
people
in
the
democracy,
the
right
--
right
to
vote
without
a
discrimination
on
account
of
race
or
color.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
holding
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957
unconstitutional
is,
we
submit,
clearly
wrong.
it
has
delayed
and
hampered
the
united
states
in
its
enforcement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
prevented
us
to
that
extent,
from
making
it
fully
effective
for
citizens
of
the
negro
race.
this
is
a
civil
action
for
preventive
relief
brought
on
september
4th,
1958
against
the
registrar
and
deputy
registrars
of
terrell
county,
georgia
for
refusing
to
permit
negroes
to
register
--
negroes
who
were
fully
qualified.
the
complaint
seeks
to
enjoin
these
state
officials
from
refusing,
for
reasons
of
race
or
color,
to
permit
fully
qualified
negroes
to
register
to
vote.
the
discriminatory
acts
and
practices
complained
of
in
the
complaint
include
undue
delay
in
processing
application
--
applications
of
negroes.
refusal
to
permit
qualified
negroes,
qualified
under
the
laws
of
georgia,
to
register
to
vote
and
the
application
of
more
stringent
standards
for
negro
applicants,
then
for
white.
the
complaint
sets
forth
the
comprehensive
plan
on
the
part
of
these
defendants,
who
are
state
officials,
to
deny
negroes
their
right
to
vote
under
the
constitution
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957.
included
are
allegations
that
the
defendants
kept
different
records,
voting
records
by
race.
allegations
that,
in
connection
with
applications
for
registration,
there
were
different
colored
cards
for
white
applicants
and
negro
applicants.
the
complaint
sets
forth
in
considerable
detail
how
this
plan
was
accomplished.
for
example,
the
complaint
lists
the
names
of
five
negroes
who
applied
to
register
in
1956
and
five
who
applied
in
1957.
and
yet,
their
applications
were
not
acted
upon
until
april
of
1958.
yet
during
the
same
period
of
time,
13
white
applicants
applied
and
their
applications
were
acted
on
within
a
day
or
two
and
in
no
case
more
than
11
days.
the
complaint
shows
how
the
defendants
arbitrarily
refused
to
register
fully
qualified
negroes,
fully
qualified
under
the
laws
of
georgia.
for
example,
it
states
that
four
negroes
took
a
literacy
test
as
required
under
the
law
of
georgia.
one
was
a
teacher
in
mathematics
in
a
public
high
school
in
terrell
county
and
held
a
bachelor
of
science
degree
from
a
georgia
college
and
a
master
of
arts
degree
from
new
york
university.
the
other
three
were
teachers
in
the
elementary
public
schools
in
georgia
and
each
one
of
these
three
had
graduated
from
albany
state
college
and
held
a
degree
from
albany
state
college,
georgia.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
reasons
given
by
these
appellees
for
refusing
to
permit
these
four
negroes
to
register
was
that
they
could
not
read
correctly
or
because
they
were
unable
to
write.
stated
another
way
then,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
state
of
georgia
refused
to
let
negroes
who
were
teachers
in
their
public
schools
who
had
graduated
from
their
colleges
and
who
held
degrees
from
colleges
in
georgia,
from
registering
to
vote
on
the
ground
that
they
were
illiterate
.a
motion
to
dismiss
this
complaint
was
made
on
four
grounds,
september
1958.
the
district
court,
in
april
1959,
dismissed
the
first
three
grounds,
holding
that
the
complaint
stated
cause
of
action
that
the
congress
was
authorized
to
provide
for
injunctive
relief,
even
though
the
--
and
not
require
the
exhaustion
of
all
other
remedies
and
that
the
complaint
should
not
be
dismissed
in
the
court's
discretion.
the
fourth
ground,
which
is
the
basis
for
this
appeal,
was
that
the
portion
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957
providing
for
an
injunctive
relief
is
unconstitutional.
on
considering
that
contention,
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
the
allegations
in
this
complaint
against
these
defendants,
who
were
officers
of
the
state
acting
under
color
of
law,
violated
any
constitutional
provision.
rather,
the
district
court
said
in
considering
the
constitutional
question,
said
this,
“we
must
close
our
mind
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
in
the
instant
case.”
the
court
then
stated
that
the
question
presented
was
whether
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957
was
broad
enough
to
permit
the
united
states
to
bring
suits
against
private
persons
not
acting
under
color
of
law.
the
court
justified
this
approach
for
the
case,
that
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
must
be
tested
on
the
basis
of
facts
actually
presented
but
rather
on
the
basis
of
hypothetical
facts,
by
saying
this,
and
i
quote
from
the
court's
opinion,
“it
is
not
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
this
particular
fish
is
properly
within
the
net,
but
whether
the
net
is
so
large
is
to
cash
--
catch
many
fish
not
properly
within
it.”
the
district
court
then
proceeded
to
weave
its
own
net,
much
--
much
larger
than
this
language
of
the
statute
justifies,
much
broader
than
--
than
congress
intended.
and
not
the
one
that
applied
with
the
justice
used
in
this
case
or
in
fact,
whatever
consider
using.
it
held
that
42
u.s.c.
1971,
it's
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
page
--
pages
2,
3
and
4,
subsection
(a)
and
(c),
read
together,
“were
broad
enough
to
permit
suits
for
injunctive
relief
against
private
actions
by
private
individuals
not
acting
under
color
of
law
and
therefore,
that
these
provisions
were
unconstitutional
in
toto.
the
united
states
has
appealed
directly
to
this
court.
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
deal
briefly
what
the
appellees'
challenge
to
the
court's
jurisdiction.
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
is
based
on
28
u.s.c.
1252
and
as
you
know,
provides
for
an
appeal
of
this
court
from
any
interlocutory
or
final
order
of
any
court,
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
in
any
civil
action
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
this
is
a
civil
action
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
the
order
dismissing
the
complaint
was
a
final
order.
the
holding
of
the
district
court
and
the
exclusive
basis
for
its
decision
was,
“that
section
1971
(c)
of
title
42
is
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
and
unconstitutional.”
what
then
is
the
contention
of
the
appellees?
they
contend
that
because
the
united
states
in
its
jurisdictional
statement,
filed
with
the
court,
has
injected
another
question
into
the
case,
that
the
court
therefore,
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
the
government
did
not,
in
fact,
inject
any
new
question
into
this
case.
to
be
sure,
we
contend
that
the
district
court's
decision
was
--
rested
on
an
erroneous
construction
of
the
statute,
but
that
does
not
and
cannot
deprive
this
court
of
jurisdiction
under
28
u.s.c.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
make
sure
that
any
decision
holding
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional
is
reviewed
quickly
by
this
court.
it
is
irrelevant
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction.
how
erroneous
the
court's
construction
of
the
statute
was
or
how
unnecessary
it
may
have
been
for
the
court
to
reach
and
decide
a
constitutional
question?
what
is
relevant
and
crucial
is
the
holding
of
the
district
court.
if
it
is
a
decision
holding
that
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
in
a
civil
action
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
party,
then
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
clearly
lies.
this
case
therefore,
we
believe,
comes
directly
within
the
expressed
terms
of
section
1252.
before
dealing
with
the
constitutional
question
decided
by
the
court,
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly
to
an
argument
stressed
by
counsel
for
appellees
in
their
brief.
counsel
say
that
if
the
appellees
engaged
in
the
practices
alleged
in
the
complaint,
that
they
would
have
been
guilty
of
violating
the
laws
of
georgia.
therefore,
it
is
contended
that
even
though
the
state
registrars
and
the
deputy
registrars
refuse
to
permit
fully
qualified
negroes
to
vote
because
of
race
or
color
that
the
state
of
georgia
did
not
deny
citizens
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color.
that's
what
is
argued
that
the
acts
of
the
appellees
were
not
the
acts
of
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
this
argument
is
so
specious
that
i
only
want
to
make
brief
comments
about
it.
the
contention
has
been
made
many
times,
decided
many
times
by
this
court.
these
decisions
are
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief,
particularly
the
comprehensive
opinion
by
chief
justice
white
in
the
home
telephone
&
telegraph
company
case.
the
gist
of
these
cases
is
that
it
is
state
action
when
state
officers
act
for
and
in
the
name
of
the
state.
would
otherwise,
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
would
be
meaningless
because
the
state,
in
order
to
circumvent,
it
would
merely
have
to
pass
laws
to
provide
the
negroes
with
full
equality,
the
right
to
vote
without
discrimination
as
to
race
or
color,
in
order
to
comply
with
the
federal
constitution
and
principle,
while
permitting
state
officers
to
disregard
in
practice
these
laws
with
impunity.
fortunately
for
our
nation,
as
this
court
has
many
times
held,
there's
no
such
debility
in
our
constitutional
system.
turning
now
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
as
i
say,
the
constitutional
provisions
--
the
statutory
provisions
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
pages
2,
3
and
4.
subsection
(a)
is
a
reenactment
of
a
provision
of
the
civil
rights
statute
of
1870.
subsections
(b)
and
(c)
were
added
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957.
subsection
(a)
applies
to
all
elections,
both
state
and
federal,
and
it
implements
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
prohibits
discrimination
in
the
voting
process
on
account
of
race
or
color
by
state
action.
subsection
(b)
secures
the
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections,
as
guaranteed
by
article
1,
sections
4
and
8
of
the
constitution.
it
protects
the
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections,
not
only
against
state
action,
but
against
individual
action
unrelated
to
any
governmental
responsibility.
subsection
(c)
merely
gives
the
united
states
authority
to
bring
a
civil
action
to
enforce
either
subsection
(a)
or
(b).
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
subsection
(c)
was
unconstitutional,
the
district
court
had
to
find
that
subsection
(a)
was
intended
to
be
broader
and
more
inclusive
than
the
fifteenth
amendment.
other
four
reasons
why
this
construction
--
strained
construction
of
that
statute,
i
believe,
was
wrong
and
i
will
merely
summarize
these
reasons.
the
language
of
the
statute
makes
it
clear
that
its
application
was
to
state
action
and
i'm
referring
now
to
subsection
(a).
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
in
voting
on
account
of
race
or
color,
“any
constitution,
law,
custom
usage,
or
a
regulation
of
any
state
or
territory
or
by
or
under
its
authority
to
the
contrary,
notwithstanding.”
the
contrasting
language
of
subsection
(b)
starts
out
and
reaches
this
way,
“no
person,
whether
acting
under
color
of
law
or
otherwise,
shall
intimidate
and
so
forth.”
this
distinguishes
the
two
subsections.
subsection
(b)
applies
only
to
federal
elections
after
which
the
power
of
congress
is
not
limited
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
applies
to
any
person,
whether
acting
under
color
of
law
or
not.
while
subsection
(a)
applies
to
both
state
and
federal
elections
and
was
intended
only
to
implement
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
applies
only
to
persons
acting
under
color
of
law.
so
that
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
statutes
or
the
--
the
language
of
those
sections,
make
it
very
clear
that
the
district
court
was
wrong.
the
second
reason
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
is
the
legislative
history
or
the
original
act
in
1870,
which
is
fully
set
forth
in
our
brief.
there
was
no
question
about
it
from
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
implement
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
third
reason
is
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957
makes
it
clear
that
this
subsection
was
to
implement
the
fifteenth
amendment
only.
both
the
house
and
the
senate
committee
reports
make
it
clear.
the
house
committee
report
on
the
bill
reproduced
a
letter
from
the
attorney
general
referring
to
the
subsection
which
said
this,
“statute
is
limited
however,
to
deprivations
of
voting
rights
by
state
offices
or
other
persons
purporting
to
act
under
color
of
law.”
throughout
the
debate
on
the
bill
and
it
was
–
it
was
certainly
scrutinized
at
every
stage
of
the
legislative
process.
the
legislators
in
both
houses
viewed
what
–
what
are
now
subsections
(a)
and
(c)
taken
together
as
implementing
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
that
purely
private
action
could
not
be
reached.
fourth
is
a
series
–
a
series
of
cases
in
this
court,
the
most
recent
of
which
is
terry
against
adams,
which
gave
full
force
and
effect
of
subsection
(a).
and
in
so
doing,
the
court
held
that
it
was
adopted
by
the
congress
to
implement
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
we
submit,
therefore,
that
the
district
court's
decision
is
erroneous
because
the
statute
cannot
by
any
reasonable
hypothesis,
either
by
its
own
language
or
by
legislative
history
or
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
be
construed
to
apply
to
wholly
private
action
unrelated
to
any
governmental
activity.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
it
could
be
assumed
by
some
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
the
court
was
correct
in
its
conclusion
that
it
could
be
applied
to
purely
private
action,
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
wrong.
this
court
in
a
long
series
of
cases
has
held
that
the
proper
scope
of
judicial
review
and
to
determine
whether
a
statute
is
--
is
valid
as
applied
to
the
facts
in
the
case.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
identical
legal
question,
identical
to
the
question
here
before
this
court,
was
presented
to
judge
wright,
seating
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
in
october
1959,
in
united
states
against
mckelvey
and
he
disposed
of
this
matter
for
saying
this.
the
defendant's
contention
is
so
obviously
without
merit
that
the
court
would
merely
deny
the
motion
to
dismiss
without
moore
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
a
district
court,
referring
to
this
case,
has
upheld
a
similar
contention
and
declared
1971
(c)
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
united
states
against
mckelvey,
177
f.supp.355.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
it
is.
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
now,
in
so
doing,
the
court
ignored
the
most
elementary
principles
of
statutory
construction,
as
repeatedly
announced
by
the
supreme
court
and
relied
on
an
old
case
interpreting
a
criminal
statute.
that
was
the
end
of
judge
wright's
opinion,
referring
to
this.
the
case
referred
to
is
united
states
against
reese,
92
u.s.,
decided
in
1875.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
many
cases
decided
by
this
court
since
that
time
which

the

rule,
as
--
it's
been
decided
so
often
by
this
court,
is
that
a

not

as
--
as

if
part
of
it
is
capable
of
being
given

there
was
no
problem
of
separating
the
valid
portion
of
the
statute
from
the
portion
that
the
district
court
claimed
it
thought
was
invalid,

in

then,
it
is
our
view
that
once
the

that
the

that
that

guideposts.
it's
the
duty
of
a

not

a
question

must
deal
with
the
case

and
not
with
imaginary
ones.
the

had
followed
these

would
have

the

by
denying
them
the
right
to

and
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
they
are
state
officers
acting
under
the
authority
of
a
state.
certainly
in
that
situation,
the
constitutionality
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957
is
entirely
free
from
doubt.
the
government
respectfully
submits
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
permitted
to
go
forward
in

that
the
voting
rights
alleged
here
to
have
been
denied
to
these
negroes,

fully
and
properly
