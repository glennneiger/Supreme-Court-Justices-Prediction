justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
is
the
government
correct
in
saying
that
you
don't
attempt
to
defend
the
decision
below
on
the
grounds
on
which
he
was
put
to
with
vesting
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
statute,
it
said
that
congress
doesn't
want
the
money
of
the
united
states
taxpayers
to
be
used
to
support
people
living
abroad
who
have
been
guilty
of
this
kind
of
offenses
--
deported
with
this
kind
of
offenses,
what
would
you
say
about
the
statute
if
it
has
been
so
phrased?
justice
john
m.
harlan
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
it's
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
say
that
they
don't
want
to
use
united
states
funds
to
officially
has
been
--
has
been
deported
because
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
you
keep
using
the
word
“penalty”
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
if
it
was
used
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
certainly,
the
way
i
have
phrased
the
statute
that
i'm
talking
about,
it
would
not
be
phrased
in
terms
of
a
penalty.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
terms
of
policy,
policy.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
a
matter
of
policy,
congress
doesn't
want
american
money
to
be
used
for
that
kind
--
in
--
in
that
kind
of
a
context.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
said
who
was
been
deported
for
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
really
understand
if
there's
any
basic
difference
between
you
and
the
government
as
to
what
you
think
the
controlling
principles
are
here
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
where
you
split
it
as
to
the
significance
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
as
to
that.
