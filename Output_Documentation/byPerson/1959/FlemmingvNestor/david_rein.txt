mr.
david
rein
i
think
it's
clear
on
the
basis
of
the
argument
made
as
far
by
mr.
davis
that
there's
really
no
disagreement
between
the
government
and
myself
as
to
the
legal
principles
controlled
here.
the
disagreement,
if
any,
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
particular
statute
that
is
before
this
court.
the
government
agrees,
and
it's
basically
our
position
that
if
this
statute
is
anyway
a
penalty
and
if
it
doesn't
constitute
a
reasonable
regulation
of
social
security
rights
within
the
ambit
of
the
social
security
program,
then
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
know
of
any
place.
mr.
david
rein
in
the
sense
which
i
used
it
--
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
know
of
any
that
uses
the
word
“penalty”
but
the
court
has
used
that
word
in
wong
wing
against
the
united
states.
it
says
that
anything
that
inflicts
a
penalty
without
a
judicial
trial
is
unconstitutional
--
mr.
david
rein
--
a
violation
of
article
iii,
section
2
in
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
what
provision
where
the
article
iii,
section
2
and
where
the
sixth
amendment
actually
uses
the
word
“penalty”.
and
what
it
is
that
provide,
you
must
have
a
judicial
trial
before
it
could
be
done
to
you.
but
i
think
it
says
“punishment”,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
made
no
distinction
here,
and
i'd
be
gratefully
--
mr.
david
rein
--
willing
to
use
the
words
“punishment”
rather
than
“penalty”.
mr.
david
rein
no.
they
equate
penalty
with
punishment.
i
don't
think
they
make
any
distinction.
mr.
david
rein
however,
presuming,
and
as
i
say,
we
are
in
agreement
here.
at
least
the
government
and
i
are
in
agreement
here
that
if
this
statute
imposes
punishment
and
it
inflicts
a
penalty,
it
is
not
a
reasonable
regulation
of
social
security
benefits,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
the
government,
however,
is
not
here
given
any
further
explanation
for
the
passage
of
the
statute
by
congress
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
explanation
it
has
given
is
only
consistent
with
punishment.
it
is
said,
and
mr.
davis
said
that
the
only
thing
he
could
believe
the
statute
would
have
is
the
view
of
congress
that
certain
people
being
deported
were
unfit
and
therefore
should
not
receive
benefits.
now,
to
my
view,
that
would
clearly
indicate
that
congress
thought
that
these
people
should
be
punished
because
they
were
unfit.
but
we
need
not
rely
simply
on
mr.
davis'
statement.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
see
exactly
what
it
was
that
congress
did
here.
and
what
it
was
that
congress
said
about
this
particular
statute.
mr.
david
rein
i
do
not.
i
think
that
there
are
too
many
cases
in
this
court
indicating
that
congress
has
power
to
amend
and
that
the
states
have
power
to
amend
social
security
system,
and
i
could
not
say
that
congress
did
not
have
power
to
amend
it
at
all
on
that
theory.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
--
mr.
david
rein
i
have
examined
--
mr.
david
rein
--
the
cases
and
i
don't
think
lynch
applies.
but
section
202
(n)
was
enacted
in
1954.
it
grew
out
of
the
bill
which
was
h.r.
9366
which
was
reported
to
the
83rd
congress
by
the
house
ways
and
means
committee.
that
particular
bill
had
three
provisions
which
i
think
are
relevant
here.
one
provision
attempted
to
do
something
along
the
lines,
which
mr.
davis
has
indicated
here,
might
be
reasonable.
that
is
--
or
keep
benefits
away
from
aliens
who
are
not
within
the
united
states.
that
was
a
bill
which
would
deny
benefits,
not
to
the
primary
beneficiaries
themselves,
not
to
the
workers
themselves,
but
to
certain
dependents
or
survivors
of
beneficiaries
who
reside
outside
the
united
states
if
they
do
not
meet
certain
residence
requirements.
now,
in
proposing
that
bill,
congress
said,
and
this
was
not
congress
but
the
house
which
proposed
that
bill.
under
a
heading
in
its
report,
and
we
set
forth
and
quoted
at
page
19
to
20,
“under
present
law,
old-age
insurance
benefits
had
been
paid
to
an
insured
worker
regardless
of
his
country
of
residence.
benefits
are
also
payable
to
otherwise
eligible
dependents
and
survivors
of
insured
individuals
regardless
of
country
of
residence
even
though
such
dependents
and
survivors
may
never
have
lived
in
the
united
states
and
may
have
had
no
personal
contact
with
the
insured
worker
over
a
long
period
of
years
other
than
receiving
contributions
to
their
support.”
and
then
the
committee
went
on
to
say,
“your
committee
believes
that
the
insured
person
himself,
who
has
earned
his
right
to
benefits
on
the
basis
of
his
work
in
american
industry
and
his
contribution
to
the
national
economy
should
be
able
to
have
those
benefits
regardless
of
his
place
of
residence.”
in
other
words,
the
only
suggestion
made
here
that
i
have
heard,
and
mr.
davis
didn't
make
it
as
strong
as
the
government
did
in
his
brief,
was
that
202
(n)
was
part
of
a
policy
of
congress
to
deprive
aliens,
nonresident
in
this
country,
of
benefits.
and
yet
here,
we
find
the
same
congress,
house
which
proposed
202
(n)
saying
that
it
never
had
such
intention.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
any
such
provision
would
be
unwise
and
unjust.
mr.
david
rein
i
was
reading
from
my
brief
19
to
20,
quoting
from
house
report
number
1698,
which
accompany
or
the
bill,
h.r.
9366,
which
became
--
later
became
the
202
(n).
the
same
bill,
however,
contain
a
provision
which
later
became
202
(n).
and
in
discussing
that
provision,
congress
did
not
put
it
under
a
heading,
“payment
of
benefits
to
persons
residing
abroad.”
on
the
contrary,
they
discussed
it
in
its
report
under
a
heading
“termination
of
benefits
on
deportation.”
and,
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
21
as
to
what
the
house
said
with
regard
to
that,
the
house
said
that
the
bill
provides
that
all
benefits
payable
on
the
earnings
record
of
an
individual
who
was
deported
from
the
united
states
because
of
illegal
entry,
conviction
of
a
crime
or
subversive
activity
shall
be
terminated.
termination
of
the
benefit
would
be
effective
upon
receipt
of
a
notice
from
the
attorney
general
that
the
individual
is
under
notice
of
deportation.
now,
when
this
bill
got
to
the
senate,
the
senate
rejected
this
provision
and
also
another
provision
which
contained
a
penalty
provision
by
denying
benefits
for
earnings
for
aliens
who
might
have
been
in
the
country
unlawfully.
the
senate
rejected
all
three
of
those
provisions
but
it,
like
the
house,
considered
only
the
first
provision,
the
one
that
will
take
away
benefits
from
dependents
and
survivors
abroad
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
policy
of
making
payments
to
people
who
are
out
of
the
country.
and
it
said
with
regard
to
that
in
the
senate
report
and
it's
quoted
at
page
22,
“that
the
house
approved
bill
would
have
prohibited
the
payment
of
dependents
and
survivors'
benefits
to
individuals
residing
outside
the
united
states
unless
such
individuals
met
certain
requirements
as
to
prior
residence
in
the
united
states
or
a
less
special
insured
status
requirements
were
met
by
the
worker
on
whose
records
the
benefits
are
payable.
your
committee
does
not
believe
the
place
of
residence
of
the
dependents
or
survivors
of
an
insured
worker
should
result
in
their
losing
protection
to
which
they
are
otherwise
entitled
as
a
result
of
contributions
paid
by
the
insured
worker.”
that
was
the
senate's
view
with
regard
to
the
question
of
paying
benefits
to
people
abroad
and
outside
the
country.
turning
to
this
provision,
which
later
became
202
(n),
the
senate
said,
“the
house
approved
bill
would
have
required
that
no
monthly
benefits
be
paid
on
the
basis
of
wages
and
self-employment
income
of
an
individual
who
has
been
deported
for
specified
causes.
your
committee
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
give
sufficient
study
to
all
the
possible
implications
of
this
provision
which
involves
termination
of
benefit
rights
under
the
contributory
program
of
old-age
&
survivors
insurance
and
has
therefore
deleted
this
provision
from
the
bill.
now,
i
think
these
conclusions
appear
from
this
short
sketch
of
the
legislative
history,
and
i'll
--
our
finding,
i
should
say,
that
in
conference,
the
house
receded
with
regard
to
the
provision
depriving
dependents
and
survivors
abroad
of
benefits.
the
senate
receded
in
their
objection
to
the
provision
which
later
became
202
(n).
though
with
certain
modifications,
the
provision
in
the
house
bill
was
then
passed.
now,
i
think
that
these
conclusions
appear
from
this
short
sketch.
in
the
first
place,
section
202
(n)
was
not
considered
by
either
house
of
congress
to
be
--
have
any
bearing
with
regard
to
a
congressional
policy
of
withholding
the
payment
of
benefits
to
aliens
residing
abroad.
on
the
contrary,
the
house
committee
that
first
suggested
202
(n)
explicitly
stated
that
it
rejected
such
a
policy.
the
senate
rejected
even
a
partial
application
of
such
a
policy.
the
house
agreed
and
we
have
no
such
policy
at
all
adopted
in
this
provision.
both
houses,
however,
considered
that
section
202
(n)
were
penal
in
character,
and
they
said
so
in
so
many
words
because
--
and
mr.
davis
has
had
a
great
deal
of
difficultly
distinguishing
perhaps
between
the
four
provisions
of
the
deportation
statute
which
were
omitted
from
those
who
were
deprived
benefits
and
those
provisions
which
were
included.
but
the
house
made
its
distinction.
we
don't
have
to
go
any
further.
it
said
that
--
the
house
of
the
senate
said
that,
“benefits
are
terminated
of
--
for
those
individuals
who
have
been
deported
for
unlawful
entry,
conviction
of
a
crime
or
subversive
activities.”
they
thought
that
that
group
included
all
those
and
clearly,
these
have
moral
connotations
and
the
distinction
was
made
on
the
basis
of
congressional
view
of
moral
guilt.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
original
defendant
in
this
case,
secretary
folsom,
the
predecessor
of
the
--
for
the
present
defendant,
also
considered
this
provision
to
be
a
penalty
in
so
many
words.
he
was
asked
to
testify
with
respect
to
a
subsequent
provision,
which,
i
think,
mr.
davis
has
mentioned
which
was
being
considered
by
congress
in
1955
which
would
make
a
penalty
of
deprivation
of
social
security
benefits,
an
additional
penalty
to
be
added
on
to
criminal
penalties
to
those
who
are
punished
under
the
smith
act
and
other
crimes
which
congress
considered
in
that
category.
testifying
on
that
provision,
secretary
folsom
opposing
the
provision,
and
he
opposed
it
on
this
ground.
he
says,
“because
the
deprivation
of
benefits,
as
provided
in
the
amendment,
is
in
the
nature
of
a
penalty
and
based
on
the
considerations
foreign
to
the
objectives
and
provisions
of
the
old-age
and
survivors
insurance
program,
the
amendment
may
well
serve
as
a
precedent
for
extension
of
similar
provisions
to
other
public
programs
and
to
other
crimes.”
and
then
he
went
on
to
say,
“the
present
law
recognizes
only
three
narrowly
limited
exceptions
to
the
basic
principle,
the
benefits
are
paid
without
regard
to
the
attitudes,
opinions,
behavior
or
personal
characteristics
of
the
individual.”
and
he
included
in
those
three
narrowly
limited
exceptions
this
provision
202
(n)
which
congress
had
passed.
the
other
two
he
mentioned
which
he
said
considered
to
be
of
a
light
category,
were
not
a
statute
of
congress
but
a
regulation
of
the
social
security
administration
itself
which
denied
dependents
benefit
payments
to
any
individual
who
have
been
found
guilty
of
the
felonious
homicide
of
the
insured
worker.
and
also
said
other
provisions
are
not
of
the
social
security
act
but
of
title
5,
that
is
the
provision
giving
government
employee
pensions,
the
so-called
act
which
was
passed
--
the
act
so-called
hiss
act
which
was
passed
by
congress
relating
to
government
employees,
denying
pensions
to
government
employees
who,
among
other
things,
have
pleaded
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
a
portion
of
the
statute
which
was
held
unconstitutional
in
the
court
of
claims
was
not
taken
to
this
court.
mr.
david
rein
in
other
words
--
mr.
david
rein
which
proposal?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
rein
the
proposal
--
mr.
david
rein
secretary
folsom,
that
was
a
different
bill.
mr.
david
rein
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
deportations.
it
had
to
do
with
penalizing.
this
bill
came
up
after
the
present
202
(n)
had
been
passed.
and
the
proposal
in
this
bill
was
to
commit
--
this
will
apply
not
to
aliens
but
to
citizens
who
were
convicted
of
certain
crimes,
who
might
be
convicted
of
certain
crimes
such
as
the
smith
act
and
other
crimes.
mr.
david
rein
no.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
david
rein
--
in
speaking
against
this
bill,
this
particular
bill
–-
mr.
david
rein
--
which
he
called
a
penalty.
yes.
he
analogized
it
to
202
(n)
and
he
said,
“the
only
provision
in
the
law
which
we
have
now
analogous
to
this
bill
--
mr.
david
rein
--
which
--
which
is
the
one
which
is
before
us
at
the
present
time.
in
other
words,
he,
although
two
years
later,
described
specifically
this
particular
bill
as
being
a
penalty.
mr.
david
rein
that's
the
course.
yes.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
and
that
he
said
--
mr.
david
rein
he
did
not
appear
and
testified
at
that
time
with
respect
to
it,
no.
but
he
described
it
as
a
penalty
in
his
testimony
a
few
years
later.
now,
the
government
in
arguing
that
the
statute
here
is
not
a
penalty,
in
arguing
in
its
brief,
makes
the
point
that
it's
not
the
question
and
some
emphasis
has
been
made
here
by
mr.
davis
that
the
point
is
that
the
alien
is
no
longer
in
the
united
states.
he's
abroad,
and
why
should
we
make
payments
to
him
while
he's
abroad?
however,
the
important
thing
is
that
if
this
same
alien
had
left
the
country,
had
gone
abroad
on
his
own
volition,
exactly
where
he
was,
he
would
receive
social
security
benefits
under
the
present
law.
so
the
factor
here
is
not
that
he's
abroad
but
the
factor
is
that
he
has
been
deported.
that
is
the
significant
difference.
mr.
david
rein
none
at
all.
mr.
david
rein
no
period,
he
would
retain
it
forever.
there
is
--
was
a
subsequent
statute
which
was
passed
in
1956
which
has
never
been
construed
by
any
court,
which
did
take
away
benefits
from
certain
aliens
who
departed
--
left
the
country
and
been
away
for
more
than
six
months.
but
only
to
those
aliens
who
had
not
been
in
the
united
states
with
an
aggregate
of
10
years
in
the
first
place,
or
who
did
not
have
full
coverage
under
the
social
security
act.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
present
provision
which
is
202
(t)
which
does
take
away
benefits
from
certain
aliens.
the
particular
petitioner
here
would
not
fall
on
that
category
because
he
had
been
in
the
united
states
for
more
than
10
years
and
he
had
the
necessary
coverage
under
the
social
security
act.
so
--
and
for
this
category
of
people,
such
as
the
aliens,
the
significant
factor
is
deportation.
and
the
law
--
and
under
the
laws
that
presently
stands,
if
he
were
abroad,
under
--
on
his
own
volition
without
deportation,
he
would
continue
to
draw
social
security
benefits
until
his
death.
so,
we
argue,
therefore,
from
this
that
there
isn't
any
policy
here
of
keeping
the
money
in
the
country
and
not
sending
it
abroad
because
congress
has
enacted
such
a
policy.
and
in
fact,
the
money
would
be
sent
abroad
to
aliens
in
the
same
category
as
the
petitioner
here
except
for
the
fact
of
deportation.
i
think
too,
and
the
government
concedes
that
--
that
the
statute
would
be
invalid
if
the
deprivation
of
benefits
were
based
upon
or
the
fact
of
antecedent
factors
and
the
governments
were
criminal
or
other
socially
undesirable
conduct
because
the
government
concedes
that
under
the
same
scheme
of
social
security
or
the
conduct
of
an
individual
and
his
behavior
in
the
language,
which
was
used
by
secretary
folsom
in
testifying
before
the
senate
finance
committee,
has
no
legitimate
bearing
upon
receipt
of
benefits.
yet,
under
202
(n),
one
cannot
escape
the
conclusion
that
that
is
precisely
--
are
the
basis
upon
which
benefits
are
being
deprived
to
certain
class
of
deportees.
i
have
already
quoted
to
the
court
the
language
used
by
the
house
and
the
senate
committee.
illegal
that
the
--
of
--
deprivation
of
benefits
are
based
upon
deportation
where
the
deportation
is
in
turn
based
upon
illegal
entry,
conviction
of
a
crime
or
subversive
activity.
now,
the
government
in
its
original
opposition
that
its
original
jurisdictional
statement
which
was
filed
in
this
court
at
--
when
it
was
first
looking
at
the
statute,
i
believe,
without
the
problems
being
presented
as
to
how
it
could
defend
it,
didn't
have
the
difficulty
mr.
davis
had
here
of
distinguishing
between
the
different
characteristics
of
deportation.
and
i
think
and
i
like
to
quote
from
the
provision
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
because
i
think
it's
obvious.
and
the
government
there
suggested
that
the
four
excluded
provisions
do
not
fall
into
that
category.
that
is
the
category
of
unlawful
entry,
conviction
of
a
crime
or
subversive
activity
and
may
have
been
excluded
because
congress
thought
they
did
not
involve
serious
derelictions.
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
both
from
the
language
of
the
reports
of
the
senate
and
the
house
in
describing
the
position
and
also
on
the
basis
of
analysis
of
the
provisions
themselves
that
the
distinction
congress
was
making
between
certain
grounds
for
deportation
and
certain
other
grounds
of
deportation
were
distinctions
relating
to
moral
conduct,
and
ideas
which
have
definitely,
a
punitive
aspect.
in
that
sense,
the
section
clearly
specifies
or
offenses
for
which
a
person
is
then
being
guilty
and
for
which
retribution
is
exacted.
i
think
one
must
clearly
look
at
202
(n)
and
one
cannot
without
it
in
any
other
way.
and
it
sets
forth
the
certain
categories
or
grounds
for
deportation
listed
in
the
immigration
nationality
act.
and
it
says
that,
“individuals
who
have
been
found
guilty
not
by
any
criminal
case
but
in
an
administrative
proceeding
of
those
offenses
for
which
they
are
deported,
they
shall
then
suffer
the
penalty
and
the
punishment
of
being
deprived
of
their
social
security
benefits.”
i
think
finally,
we
must
consider
the
statute
to
be
a
penalty
and
punitive
in
character
under
the
analysis
which
was
made
by
this
court
in
the
trop
case.
that
whenever
a
statute
comes
before
this
court,
and
it
--
and
it
has
consequences
which
appear
to
deprive
one
of
a
privilege
or
ceratin
other
benefits,
and
then
if
the
court
cannot
find
any
legitimate
legislative
purpose
for
that
deprivation
of
benefits,
the
only
conclusion
that
the
court
can
come
to
is
that
--
or
the
statute
is
being
imposed
as
a
penalty
and
his
punishment.
and
in
the
language
of
the
trop
case,
the
court
there
said
that
that
statute
was
punishment
because
there
is
no
other
legitimate
purpose
the
statute
can
search.
mr.
david
rein
i'd
it's
exactly
the
same
--
mr.
david
rein
--
as
we
have
now.
and
that's
practically
what
congress
said.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
it's
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
impose
a
penalty
on
anybody
unless
--
mr.
david
rein
--
or
punishment.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
taking
away
benefit
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
your
honor
used
the
word
“guilt”.
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
your
honor
used
the
--
the
term
“guilt”
and
i
--
perhaps
i
assumed
punishment
goes
with
guilt.
and
that
would
be
the
connotation
that
congress
had.
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
i
think
that
that
would
have
to
be
analyzed.
it
certainly
is
not
consistent
with
the
general
purposes
of
the
social
security
program
which
is
being
administered
here
without
regard
to
--
no
one
who
is
in
the
united
states
gets
deprived
or
accepted
as
other
statute,
gets
deprived
of
social
security
for
conviction
of
crime.
once
you
get
to
the
point,
the
way
you
were
taking
away
a
privilege
and
you
were
doing
it
in
a
form
where
it
involves
an
imposition
of
punishment,
which,
i
think,
you
must
say,
that
this
statute
does
and
i
think
that
your
honor's
statute
would
do
because
again,
to
say
that
you
take
away
something
from
somebody
because
of
his
conduct,
you
are
saying
that
you
are
punishing
him.
i
can't
see
any
other
way
around,
unless
one
would
say
that
there
is
certain
--
the
only
distinction
would
be,
you
might
say
that
a
person
and
the
distinction
which
have
been
made
in
the
case
of
his
--
that
he
might
not
be
entitled
to
hold
certain
public
office,
let
us
say,
because
of
that
because
he
is
not
fit
for
that.
but
you
can't
say
he's
not
fit
to
receive
money.
we
don't
have
any
sense
of
--
his
conduct
incapacitated
him
from
acquiring
some
function
or
job
so
it
must
be
considered
punishment.
and
if
it
is
punishment,
we
need
go
no
further
in
this
case
as
to
whether
it's
a
desirable
punishment
or
a
policy
punishment
because
if
it
is
punishment,
it
cannot
be
inflicted
without
a
judicial
trial.
i
think
that's
the
--
the
main
constitutional
problem
we
have
in
this
case.
and
in
that
respect,
this
case
is
no
different
than
the
wong
wing
case
which
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
did
not
contest
that
and
perhaps
i'd
better
put
it
this
way.
i
think
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
as
it's
sometimes
discussed
in
cases
of
this
kind,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
vested
right
or
a
gratuity
is
not
a
worthwhile
issue
to
get
into.
i
think
he
has
a
right
which
the
government
concedes
and
we
both
concede
that
his
right
is
sufficiently
valuable
that
it
cannot
be
taken
away
from
him
in
violation
of
certain
other
constitutional
provisions.
mr.
david
rein
i
said
congress
has
the
right
to
amend
the
law
reasonably.
i
don't
say
it
can
amend
in
any
way.
mr.
david
rein
it
has
no
--
well,
there
are
two
grounds,
i
would
say,
with
that.
it
has
no
rational
relationship
to
the
general
purposes
of
social
security.
and
this
particular
statute
was
not
passed
although
it's
labeled
an
amendment
to
the
social
security
act.
it
was
not
passed
within
the
framework
of
social
security
legislation.
it
was
passed
for
an
entirely
different
reason
for
the
purposes
of
punishment.
and
therefore,
we
get
into
certain
other
factors.
just
as,
for
example,
congress
also
laid
in
to
get
an
amendment
to
the
social
security
act,
there's
another
provision
saying
people
convicted
of
certain
crimes
can,
in
addition
to
getting
a
prison
sentence,
be
deprived
of
their
social
security
benefits.
mr.
david
rein
no.
not
at
all.
mr.
david
rein
not
at
all.
he's
being
deprived
of
certain
substantial
benefits.
mr.
david
rein
no,
the
fact
that
congress
has
the
power
to
make
these
changes
doesn't
make
it
any
less
punishment.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
in
other
words
--
first
place,
i
don't
say
congress
has
the
power
to
make
this
particular
change
but
the
fact
that
congress
may
take
away
certain
benefits.
for
example,
congress
may
punish,
that
is
true,
provided
it
does
it
in
the
constitutional
fashion.
of
course,
congress
may
punish
if
that's
what
it
intends
to
do.
congress
may
also
take
away
benefits
if
it
is
done
--
mr.
david
rein
--
within
the
framework
of
the
social
security
act.
but
i
don't
think
it
advances
the
argument
to
say
that
because
he
has
not
--
does
not
have
a
vested
right,
it
is
not
punishment.
one
does
not
have
a
vested
right,
let
us
say,
to
be
a
member
of
the
board
or
to
--
to
get
into
certain
professions,
yet,
it
was
held
to
be
punishment
in
cummings
against
missouri
to
deprive
one
of
that
privilege.
mr.
david
rein
well,
this
man
was
drawing
social
security.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
he
was
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
don't
follow
you
because
when
congress
made
that
change,
it
was
taking
away
from
him
something
which
he
had.
now,
i
don't
think
it
matters
if
you're
going
to
say
that
it's
a
right,
it's
a
privilege.
i
think
that
it's
a
semantic
use
of
language
that
advances
us
not
at
all
because
i
know
that
congress
took
away
from
this
man
his
$60
a
month
which
he
was
getting.
now,
i
don't
want
to
concede
that
by
saying
that
it
is
not
a
vested
right
in
a
sense
that
by
conceding
that
he
did
not
have
a
formal
contract
with
congress,
which
could
not
be
amended
that,
therefore,
when
congress
took
away
the
$60
a
month,
they
did
not
take
something
away
from
him.
they
took
away
$60
a
month.
there's
any
question
about
that.
and
i
think
that
that's
substantial
enough
in
interest,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
substantial
enough
in
interest
to
bring
into
play
these
constitutional
questions
that
follow
from
the
imposition
of
a
penalty.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct.
i
--
mr.
david
rein
nature
of
this
particular
statute.
mr.
david
rein
and
i
think
that
that's
the
--
that
would
be
true.
we
both
adopt
the
same
basic
legal
approach
and
constitutional
approach
as
to
how
the
statute
should
be
measured
and
what
the
principles
are
that
should
measure
the
statute,
and
our
sole
difference
as
to
what
is
the
nature
of
the
particular
statute.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
i
do
hang
it
on
a
number
of
provisions
because
--
mr.
david
rein
i
invoke
--
mr.
david
rein
--
for
the
--
mr.
david
rein
i
--
mr.
david
rein
if
i
may
just
say
a
word
on
that
--
that
that
this
court
has
not
taken
that
view
of
the
ex
post
facto
statute.
mr.
david
rein
no.
mr.
david
rein
cummings
against
missouri
relied
upon
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
so
did
ex
parte
garland,
and
quite
recently,
in
this
court,
the
garner
case
and
the
american
communications
association
against
douds
discussed
the
statutes.
they
said
those
particular
statutes
were
not
ex
post
facto
because
they
did
not
operate
retroactively.
but
they
both
assumed
that
civil
penalties
were
ex
post
facto.
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
i
only
know
what
the
case
has
said,
and
what
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
really
rely
on
that
and
--
mr.
david
rein
the
principal
ground
on
which
i
rely,
and
the
principal
constitutional
provision
is
article
iii,
section
2
in
the
sixth
amendment
on
the
ground
that
you
cannot
inflict
punishment
without
a
judicial
trial.
mr.
david
rein
article
iii,
section
2
says
exactly
that,
i
believe.
i
don't
have
the
precise
language,
but
it
says
you
must
have
a
judicial
trial.
mr.
david
rein
well,
if
i
may
submit
to
your
honor,
the
case
that
i
think
is
controlling
on
this
statute
is
the
case
of
wong
wing
against
the
united
states.
that
is
the
case
in
which
a
statute
passed
by
congress
provided
that
an
alien
--
an
alien
who
is
being
deported
on
the
ground
of
having
been
illegally
here
as
a
chinese
could,
prior
to
deportation,
be
imprisoned
on
the
ground
of
having
been
unlawful
resident
in
the
united
states.
the
whole
process
was
done
administratively.
this
case
came
up
after
the
case
of
fong
yue
ting
in
which
the
court
had
sustained
the
portion
of
the
statute
providing
for
the
deportation
of
the
alien
by
the
administrative
process.
but
the
court
said
that
the
added
feature
of
the
wong
wing
statute
that
is
the
imprisonment
of
the
alien
made
it
unconstitutional.
and
the
court
there
said,
i
think
it
will
be
useful
to
quote,
page
35
to
36,
it's
quoted
in
my
brief.
“we
regard
it
as
settled
by
our
previous
decisions
that
the
united
states
can,
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
by
congressional
enactment,
forbid
aliens
or
classes
of
aliens
from
coming
within
their
borders
and
expel
aliens
or
classes
of
aliens
from
their
territory.
and
can
in
order
to
make
effectual
such
decree
of
exclusion
or
expulsion
to
devolve
the
power
and
duty
of
identifying
and
arresting
the
persons
included
in
such
decree
and
causing
their
deportation
upon
executive
or
subordinate
officials.
but
when
congress
sees
fit
to
further
promote
such
a
policy
by
subjecting
the
persons
of
such
aliens
to
infamous
punishment
of
hard
labor
or
by
confiscating
their
property,
we
think
such
legislation
to
be
valid.
it
must
provide
for
a
judicial
trial
to
establish
the
guilt
of
the
accused.
mr.
david
rein
i
would
contend
that
it
is,
yes.
and
i
do
not
want
to
say
that
i
think
that
congress
can
amend
the
statute
to
be
a
concession
in
that
respect,
it
certainly
is
property.
i
consider
that
$60
a
month
is
property.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
answer.
if
congress
has
right
to
change
the
law,
that
mean
that
congress
would
have
the
right
to
take
away
under
certain
circumstances
this
property
from
certain
other
individuals.
mr.
david
rein
but
it
doesn't
make
it
any
less
property.
mr.
david
rein
well,
yes.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
what
the
nature
of
the
property
is
or
what
the
nature
of
the
privilege
is
so
that
--
mr.
david
rein
--
you
have
to
say
it's
vested
or
not.
mr.
david
rein
well,
congress
might
give
someone
a
house
and
lot
on
the
provisions
which
had
said
they
could
take
it
away
on
a
certain
other
--
other
circumstances
and
not
under
others.
perhaps
this
may
--
may
help,
your
honor,
to
have
my
view
on
it.
mr.
david
rein
suppose
congress
gave
someone
a
house
and
lot
under
a
statute
which
said,
“congress
can
take
this
away
for
reason
a
and
b
but
not
for
reason
c
and
d.”
mr.
david
rein
now,
the
fact
that
congress
can
take
that
property
away
from
him
for
reason
a
and
b,
doesn't
make
it
any
less
property.
it
still
can't
take
it
away
from
him
for
reason
c
and
d.
and
if
congress
attempts
to
take
it
away
from
him
for
reasons
c
and
d,
he
is
protected
against
congress
in
that
respect.
however,
he
is
not
protected
against
congress
if
congress
takes
it
away
for
reasons
a
and
b,
which
congress
provided
well
reasons
it
could
take
it
away.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
if
it
was
so
provided
and
if
it
was
so
understood
in
advance,
it
probably
would
not
be,
but
--
but
i'm
just
saying
the
house
and
lot
is
still
property
regardless
of
whether
congress
can
take
it
away
or
not.
it
can
validly
take
it
away.
that
would
be
my
view.
mr.
david
rein
well,
may
i
say
--
i
can
only
say
in
response
that
the
wong
wing
case
which
sees
to
be
indistinguishable
here
relied
on
that
under
sixth
amendment
to
invalidate
to
statute
there.
now,
there,
to
there
was
no
crime
but
there
was
a
punishment.
now,
i
don't
see
how
you
get
around
the
problem
of
saying,
for
example,
because
congress
doesn't
label
something
a
crime
--
mr.
david
rein
i
think
the
purposes
of
those
constitutional
provisions
are
to
provide
that
you
can't
reach
the
end
result
without
going
through
that
procedure.
mr.
david
rein
and
if
congress
goes
ahead
and
reaches
the
end
result
of
imprisonment
or
a
fine
without
having
a
prosecution
for
a
crime,
it
then
violates
the
constitution.
mr.
david
rein
on
the
assumption,
if
i
may
have
just
a
moment,
that
an
ex
post
facto
law
does
cover
penalties
of
this
character,
this
statute
is
an
ex
post
facto
law.
now,
the
government
makes
some
contention
in
its
brief
that
it's
not
an
ex
post
facto
law
because
in
fact
the
statute
was
passed
in
1954.
the
alien
did
not
actually
become
--
receive
his
benefits
until
1955.
but
i
think
what
is
important
here
for
ex
post
facto
considerations
is
the
date
of
the
conduct
on
the
basis
of
which
the
penalty
was
imposed.
and
that
conduct
terminated
in
1939.
i
think
it's
indicated
earlier
by
mr.
davis.
he
said
there
was
no
clear
termination
date.
what
is
significant
here
is
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
which
was
the
body
which
decided
that
the
alien
was
deportable
and
set
forth
the
grounds,
said
that
his
membership
in
the
communist
party
had
lasted
or
terminated
in
1939
or
at
least
that
was
the
last
date
on
which
they
found
membership.
so
that
we
therefore
find
that
--
or
the
conduct
which
terminated
in
1939
was
the
basis
of
the
later
penalty
which
was
inflicted
upon
and
first
by
the
1950
statute
of
deportation
and
now,
by
the
1954
statute.
and
i
think
it
comes
within
the
language
used
to
describe
the
ex
post
facto
clause
in
the
american
communications
association
against
douds
case
in
which
it
said
that
what
is
controlling
is
whether
the
conduct
to
which
the
individuals
are
being
punished
has
been
completed,
so
that
“nothing
that
those
persons
proscribed
by
its
terms
could
ever
do
or
change
the
result.”
and
that
was
the
situation
here.
after
1939,
there
was
nothing
that
the
petitioner
here
could
do
that
would
change
the
result
which
led
to
the
depravation
--
first
is
deportation,
the
deprivation
--
laid
the
deprivation
of
benefits.
now,
the
fact
that
he
could
be
deported
on
that
ground
is
really
not
relevant
here
because
this
court
has
held
that
deportation
is
not
punishment.
and
therefore,
they
said
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
does
not
apply
to
deportation
on
that
ground.
i
think
finally,
and
on
the
view
that
this
is
a
penalty
and
that
is
being
penalized
for
the
conduct
which
was
their
membership
in
the
communist
party
it
is
clear
under
the
cases
in
this
court
that
the
conduct
here
which
the
petitioner
engaged
in
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
is
shown
both
the
yates
case
and
by
the
de
jonge
case.
and
for
any
loss
of
privilege
or
punishment
to
be
inflicted
on
the
basis
of
conduct
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
would
be
a
violation
of
that
provision
of
the
constitution.
thank
you.
