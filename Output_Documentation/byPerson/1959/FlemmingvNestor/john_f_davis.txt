mr.
john
f.
davis
this
case
involves
no
issue
of
fact
--
fraction
but
only
a
naked
question
of
constitutional
law.
the
issue
is
simply
whether
congress
has
power
to
cut
off
aliens'
social
security
benefits
when
they
are
deported
on
the
basis
of
membership
in
the
communist
party.
the
case
comes
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
held
that
mr.
nestor's
social
security
rights
had
become
vested
and
could
not
be
terminated.
although
this
court
postponed
the
question
of
jurisdiction
until
argument,
the
appeal
appears
to
fall
squarely
within
the
word
and
the
spirit
of
the
jurisdictional
statute
which
authorizes
direct
appeals
from
a
district
court
decision
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
in
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
the
only
apparent
question
on
jurisdiction
is
whether
or
not
the
suit
below
should
have
been
before
a
three-judge
court
rather
than
below
--
before
a
single
judge.
but
this
suit
was
instituted
by
mr.
nestor
pursuant
to
the
specific
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
which
provides
a
remedy
for
review
of
administrative
decisions
by
a
district
court
and
makes
no
provision
for
a
three-judge
court
in
that
case.
the
three-judge
court
provision
of
course
comes
into
effect
when
someone
attempts
to
enjoin
the
operation
or
execution
of
an
act
of
congress.
it
does
not
control
where
the
action
is
under
a
specific
review
provision
such
as
this
and
where
there
is
no
injunction
against
the
operation
of
the
security
act
--
social
security
act
involved.
therefore,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
district
court
is
a
single
judge,
did
have
jurisdiction.
and
since
his
action
was
specifically
based
upon
unconstitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress,
this
court
in
turn
appears
to
have
jurisdiction.
ephram
nestor
came
to
this
country
from
bulgaria
as
a
young
man
in
1913.for
some
reason,
he
never
was
naturalized.
but
in
1933,
he
joined
the
communist
party
and
he
remained
a
member
of
that
party
at
least
until
1939.
on
the
basis
of
this
communist
party
membership
--
preceding
this
were
commenced
against
him
in
1953
to
deport
him
to
bulgaria
which
was
the
country
from
which
he
had
come.
and
he
was,
in
fact,
deported
in
july
of
1956.
meanwhile,
he
had
qualified
for
social
security
benefits
and
in
fact,
for
several
months
had
received
social
security
benefits
amounting
to
$55.60
a
month.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
actually
qualified
as
of
november
of
1955
and
the
first
--
it
was
the
--
the
order
came
in
1956
just
before
he
was
deported.
so
he
received
the
payments
for
november
of
1955,
december
and
end
of
1956
until
he
was
deported.
as
a
specific
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
--
he
has
started
an
employment
which
was
subject
to
social
security
in
about
1936,
i
believe,
it
was
early.
he
was
--
he
was
a
painter
by
profession
and
some
of
his
earlier
employment
came
soon
after
the
act
was
enacted.
as
was
specifically
provided
by
a
1954
amendment
to
the
immigration
law,
the
attorney
general
notified
the
social
security
administration
when
nestor
was
deported.
and
this
is
also
specifically
required
by
the
law.
the
payments
for
social
security
payments
were
then
terminated.
neither
of
these
actions
is
subject
to
discretion.
it's
automatically
under
the
statutes
that
when
a
man
is
deported
for
this
reason
that
his
payment
should
--
shall
be
terminated.
mr.
nestor
appealed
the
termination
of
his
--
of
his
--
of
these
benefits.
he
was
granted
a
hearing
before
a
referee
in
the
social
security
administration.
the
--
the
decision
was
upheld
by
the
referee
and
after
having
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies,
he
then
went
to
the
district
court
and
asked
for
review
of
this
decision.
and
as
i
mentioned,
the
district
court
held
that
the
statutory
provision
cutting
off
the
benefits
was
unconstitutional
and
it
is
from
that
out
--
the
government
has
appealed
directly
to
this
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
section
10
to
--
section
(n),
it's
--
appears
at
page
9
--
91
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
202
in
--
of
the
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
--
we
don't
know
the
number
--
the
years
that
he
actually
was
a
member
but
presumably
not.
at
least
no
--
there's
no
basis
of
illegality,
no
allegation
of
illegality
back
in
1936.
we
don't
have
any
termination
date
on
--
on
his
membership.
he
was
a
member
at
least
until
1939
and
as
of
that
date,
there
would
be
no
change
in
the
laws.
the
basic
questions
are,
first,
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
reduce
or
eliminate
benefits
once
stranded.
and
the
second
question,
if
so,
were
the
cutting
off
benefits
to
deported
aliens
under
these
circumstances
is
a
proper
exercise
of
that
power.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
this
was
enacted
in
1954.
it
was
an
amendment
to
the
act
in
1954.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
he
was
--
he
was
--
presumably
paid
taxes
from
about
1936
until
his
--
until
his
employment
ceased.
and
that
was
before
his
taxes
were
--
before
this
was
found
in
the
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
after
the
proceedings
were
instituted
but
before
there
was
any
finality
to
any
order
of
deportation.
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
there
is
no
refund
given
and
--
in
--
in
this
connection.
i
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
whether
--
generally,
without
regard
to
the
specific
grounds
for
termination
whether
generally,
congress
has
the
power
to
reduce
or
eliminate
payments
once
they've
been
included
in
an
act
and
once
taxes
have
been
paid
under
the
act.
now,
congress
in
so
many
words
has
provided
that
it
retains
the
power
to
amend
or
appeal
any
provision
of
the
act.
and
in
fact,
the
provisions
of
the
act
have
been
repeatedly
amended
since
it
was
first
passed
in
1935.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
at
page
92
and
93
of
my
brief
that
begins
with
the
paragraph
numbered
4
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
92.
it's
a
short
section,
the
right
to
alter,
amend
or
appeal
any
provision
of
this
act
of
congress.
most
of
the
amendments
to
be
sure
have
been
amendments
to
increase
payments,
increase
benefits
under
the
social
security
act.
but
in
--
as
an
incident
of
this,
there
have
been
many
cases
where
--
as
to
individuals,
their
benefits
have
been
reduced
or
eliminated
because
of
readjustments
in
the
act.
and
in
the
lower
courts
wherever
this
has
been
litigated,
the
power
to
change
the
act
has
been
--
has
been
upheld.
and
indeed
it
seems
essential
that
congress
should
have
this
power
since
otherwise
the
--
the
act
would
be
frozen
in
its
original
form
from
the
way
it
was
passed.
and
congress
certainly
never
had
had
intended
any
such
result.
the
only
reason
that
there's
any
--
any
question
about
it
is
that
this
is
a
contributory
system
and
the
individual
pays
--
has
made
contributions
before
the
changes.
and
it's
in
--
it's
important
in
this
respect
to
know
that
these
contributions
are
specifically
in
the
nature
of
taxes.
the
--
they
have
made
as
a
part
of
the
tax
law
and
the
payments
which
a
man
receives
are
not
in
any
manner
conditioned
upon
his
having
paid
taxes
and
his
having
paid
taxes
in
no
way
gives
him
a
right
to
--
by
itself,
to
qualify
for
payments
under
the
system.
in
other
words,
the
system
is
financed
through
a
--
through
taxing
the
--
the
labor
force
for
the
idea
that
they
will
support
the
social
security
system
as
a
whole.
but
there
is
no
direct
relationship
in
the
law
between
the
taxes
which
any
individual
pay
--
pays
and
the
benefits
which
he
receives.
congress
purposely
tied
the
--
the
financing
of
the
program
onto
taxes
of
the
labor
force
because
they
wanted
it
felt
that
social
security
benefits
were
not
charity,
that
they
were
not
in
the
nature
of
--
of
relief
that
labor
was
paying
for
its
own
--
its
--
its
own
way
in
this
thing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
not
--
not
--
there
--
there
is
a
trust
fund
that
covers
the
whole
social
security
system
but
there
is
no
fund
for
an
individual.
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
there's
no
record
even
of
the
taxes
as
far
as
the
individual
is
concerned.
what
they
do
is
to
keep
an
employment
record
in
order
to
determine
what
his
rights
will
be,
but
his
rights
are
not
dependent
upon
taxes
having
been
paid
on
his
employment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they'll
attempt
to
collect
them
from
him.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
they
will
attempt
to
collect
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
actually,
his
employer
withholds
them
as
--
as
you
know
in
the
employer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
they
--
no,
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
do
not
collect
them
for
some
reason,
if
he
resist
the
payment
of
them
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
--
and
for
some
reason,
they
are
never
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
collected.
he
still
is
entitled
to
his
social
security
benefits
as
long
as
he
has
under
covered
employment
during
this
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
has
no
relationship
to
his
--
to
his
job.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
well
--
well,
of
course,
we're
dealing
now
with
non-government
employment.
of
course,
this
is
private
--
this
is
social
security
in
private
employment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
so
the
--
there's
no
reason
--
there's
no
federal
impact
on
his
job
whether
he
pays
or
doesn't
pay.
it's
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
certainly
in
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
in
the
domestic
field,
it
must
be
--
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
belongs
entirely.
but
what
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
the
entire
system
is
financed
through
the
taxes
on
the
employer
and
the
employees.
it's
supposed
to
be
divided
half
and
half,
except
in
the
case
of
self-employment
where
of
course
--
which
is
now
under
the
system
too
where
the
entire
contribution
comes
from
the
person
who
is
self-employed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
that
they
--
the
fact
they
call
them
taxes
or
put
them
in
the
tax
law
is
the
determinative
factor.
but
the
fact
that
these
are
not
like
insurance
premiums
or
annuity
premiums
which
give
a
contractual
right
and
the
right
isn't
--
isn't
tied
in
to
the
payment,
does
seem
to
me
to
make
a
material
difference.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
act
does
call
it
insurance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
because
this
does
not
have
the
features
which
you
generally
have
within
insurance
--
insurance
policy.
i
mean
there's
no
right
of
return,
no
building
up
of
a
--
of
a
surrender
fund,
the
--
the
ordinary
features
which
you
find
in
private
insurance
are
not
present
here.
this
is
social
security
insurance
in
--
in
a
--
in
a
sense
rather
than
a
commercial
type
of
insurance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
pay
every
month
--
they
every
week
if
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
they
were
told
--
they
were
told
whatever
pay
--
whatever
pay
there
is.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
but
in
the
same
way
that
they
pay
income
taxes
and
get
benefits
from
income
taxes.
these
things
have
to
be
financed
in
some
way
and
these
are
--
are
financed
through
this
particular
kind
of
a
tax.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
--
in
--
basically
yes,
they
--
i
don't
mean
that
the
income
tax
finances
the
social
security
system,
but
citizens
of
the
united
states
get
certain
benefits
and
--
and
rights
from
the
federal
government.
and
these
are
financed
through
their
paying
taxes.
their
rights
are
not
dependent
upon
their
paying
of
taxes.
they
--
they
--
that
they
--
the
taxes
were
enforced
against
them
regardless
of
whether
they
get
the
rights
and
they
get
the
rights
regardless
of
whether
they
pay
the
taxes.
and
the
same
is
true
in
this
situation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
is
--
it
is.
it
was
the
original
act
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
it
was
in
the
--
in
the
original
act
but
when
they
amended
it
in
1939,
the
word
insurance
--
for
example,
you
get
the
--
the
--
well,
the
term
insurance
financing
old-age
and
survivors
disability
insurance,
the
term
insurance
works
into
the
act
in
the
1939
amendment.
it
wasn't
then
in
1935
and
there
wasn't
any
real
change
in
the
nature
of
it,
but
there
was
a
desire
--
there
was
a
desire
at
that
time
to
tell
these
people
that
they
were
paying
their
own
way
that
this
wasn't
charity.
and
i
think
that's
where
they
put
the
term
--
use
this
term.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
indeed,
it
doesn't.
the
--
the
--
actually,
the
--
in
the
early
days
particularly,
what
you
get
--
what
people
got
was
not
dependent
upon
what
they
paid
but
from
what
was
being
paid
currently
and
that
by
and
large
is
the
way
the
system
works
that
--
that
financial
itself
as
you
go
along
and
the
present
labor
force
is
really
paying
for
the
social
security
benefits
which
the
older
and
retired
people
are
getting
at
the
present
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
what's
it
for?
it's
--
it's
used
--
the
funds
are
used
from
that
to
--
to
finance
the
payments
and
--
and
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
this
is
--
this
has
been
built
up
through
the
years
and
it
is
used.
for
a
long
time,
it
was
increasing.
this
fund
was
increasing
year
by
year.
in
the
last
several
years,
it's
been
somewhat
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
dropped
down.
but
you
get
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
you
get
the
income
from
that
and
you
get
an
appropriation
by
congress
and
the
two
were
used
for
the
payment
of
the
--
of
the
current
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
--
i
should
correct
myself
a
little.
these
payments
do
not
actually
go
into
the
--
into
the
trust
fund.
what
happens
is
the
payments
which
are
collected
from
the
employee
and
the
employer
go
into
the
general
treasury.
but
there
is
a
general
appropriation
whereby
the
same
amount
is
appropriated
from
funds
not
otherwise
used
and
goes
into
the
trust
fund
so
that
the
amount
that
goes
into
the
trust
fund
is
actually
measured
by
the
amounts
which
are
collected.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
except
the
--
they
are
also
based
--
they
--
they
use
the
interest
from
that
to
supplement
it.
the
--
the
tax
payments
are
going
up.
the
tax
payments
are
now
5%
or
maybe
6%.
they're
going
up
--
they
figured
it
to
9%
before
they
get
the
--
before
they
have
the
system
really
have
enough
tax
system
to
cover
it
with
the
insurance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
dig
into
this
fund,
the
--
the
interest
from
the
fund
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
then
in
to
the
fund.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
used
up
the
fund
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
imagine
they
would.
we
haven't
faced
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
would
be
no
money
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
annual
appropriations
by
congress
is
--
that
is
right.
and
if
there
weren't
enough,
well,
congress
would
either
have
to
abandon
social
security
or
appropriate
more
money
funds.
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
this
insurance
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
as
the
term
“insurance”
repeatedly
and
insured
repeatedly.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
the
actual
legal
incidence
of
this
are
not
the
same
as
we
think
of
as
insurance.
maybe
--
maybe
we'd
do
better
not
to
argue
--
maybe
i
would
do
better
not
to
argue
about
whether
this
is
insurance
but
rather
to
raise
the
question
of
whether
there
was
any
contractual
right,
whether
a
man
has
--
by
making
his
payments,
any
contractual
right
with
the
government
to
a
return
of
--
of
benefits.
and
i
think
that
if
we
put
it
on
that
basis,
it's
perfectly
clear
under
the
act
that
there
is
no
contract
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
well,
what
i
--
i
--
that
--
i
had
originally
stated
it
in
terms
of
tax
against
insurance
but
i
think
that
the
only
reason
that
that
is
important
is
because
insurance
is
generally
thought
of
as
a
contractual
right.
and
if
we
attack
the
basis
whether
or
not
it
is
a
contractual
right,
we
no
longer
have
to
worry
about
whether
it's
insurance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
up
--
up
to
the
present
time,
i
was
attacking
--
i
was
approaching
the
general
proposition
they
have
a
right
to
abandon
the
whole
--
the
whole
scheme.
they
have
abandoned
a
right
to
change
the
entire
scheme.
mr.
john
f.
davis
or
to
do
a
way
with
it.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
now,
when
--
eventually,
i
shall
come
to
the
problem
that
this
particular
cutting
off
is
an
appropriate
exercise
of
that
power
to
--
to
change
and
that's
a
different
question.
that's
a
--
that's
a
question
of
whether
this
is
appropriate
legislation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
before
this.
since
this
act
--
since
this
section
has
been
passed,
there
have
been
two
other
sections
which
deal
with
--
generally,
with
cutting
off
groups.
one
of
them
is
with
respect
to
aliens
who
voluntarily
go
abroad
and
stay
for
more
than
six
months.
and
if
they
haven't
been
in
this
country
for
10
years,
then
their
rights
are
cut
off.
and
the
second
section
provides
for
cutting
off
the
social
security
benefits
of
individuals
who
are
convicted
of
espionage,
sabotage
in
--
in
the
smith
act
cases.
those
are
the
specific
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
those
are
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
present
provisions
in
the
act.
the
--
these
last
two
haven't
been
passed
upon
by
--
by
the
support
applied.
there
have,
however,
been
--
as
i
say,
been
incidence
where
other
adjustments
in
the
act
have
resulted
in
individuals
losing
their
rights.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
for
a
long
time,
self-insure
--
self-employed
people
were
not
subject
to
the
tax
and
their
self-employment
wasn't
counted
in,
in
determining
whether
they
were
retired.
it's
the
so-called
“work
test”.
and
in
order
to
qualify
for
payments,
why,
you
have
to
be
retired.
but
when
--
when
self-employment
wasn't
covered,
you
could
be
retired
and
--
and
practice
law,
for
example,
on
your
own.
then
the
law
was
changed
to
bring
self-employed
people
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
and
as
a
result,
some
people
who
had
had
benefits
and
at
--
from
employment
and
had
retired
and
then
supplementing
that
with
their
own
income,
were
now
--
were
now
cut
off
from
their
benefits
because
they
were
self-employed
and
these
earnings
were
now
considered
as
--
as
part
of
the
--
the
work
test.
this
was
--
this
was
litigated
and
the
court
--
and
never
got
beyond
the
district
court
but
the
district
court
held
that
this
was
an
appropriate
amendment
by
--
by
congress
and
that
rights
could
be
cut
off
in
this
nature,
in
this
manner.
i
may
say
there's
been
some
experience
too
with
the
state
retirement
systems
and
there
is
a
case,
pennie
against
reis,
an
--
an
old
case,
132
united
states
in
which
it
was
held
that
--
i
think
that
was
the
california
retirement
systems
holding
that
they
could
cut
off
benefits
even
though
they
had
once
been
received
within
general
statutory
power
to
amend.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir,
i
think
there
was.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
on
--
i
think
there
was
a
contribution.
mr.
john
f.
davis
when
was
it?
mr.
john
f.
davis
132
u.s.464.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it's
a
long
time
ago.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
have
--
we
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
i
have
the
data
but
--
but
it
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
then
this
--
we
have
collected
these
cases
dealing
with
the
state
system
on
page
--
systems
on
page
56,
57
and
58
of
our
brief.
pennie
against
reis
was
a
--
was
a
--
i
think
he
was
a
policeman.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
he
was
a
policeman
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
i
think
he
was
in
california.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
certainly
rely
on
it,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
even
if
it
weren't
there.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
mean
this
is
making
specific
what
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
essential
to
make
the
system
work
anyway.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
that
--
to
that
--
in
that
respect,
that's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
that
--
that's
quite
true.
in
several
places
in
that
brief,
i
don't
think
they
would
quarrel
with
what
--
with
what
i
have
said
this
day.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
might
in
some
details
but
basically,
they
don't
claim
that
you
cannot
change
that
this
is
the
contract
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
do
not
claim
it's
a
vested
interest.
they
say
that
this
particular
cutting
off
is
a
punishment
and
it's
unconstitutional.
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
said
it
was
a
vested
interest.
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there's
language
in
lynch
against
the
united
states.
that
however
is
not
--
that's
a
more
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
they're
not
claiming
it's
a
contract
in
this
case.
that
is
right.
i
--
i
believe
they're
not
and
mr.
rein
would
--
would
be
in
a
position
[laughs]
--
he
have
the
last
word
on
that
but
his
brief
--
in
his
brief,
there
are
several
cases
where
they
admit
that
there
can
be
changes
in
these
rights
as
long
as
they're
appropriate
changes
and
comes
with
the
social
security
system.
and
that
brings
us
to
what,
i
think,
is
--
is
the
most
--
more
difficult
question
in
the
case
and
that
is
whether
to
cut
off
an
alien's
rights
for
social
security
business
--
benefits
on
the
basis
of
his
being
deported
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
whether
this
is
an
appropriate
--
appropriate
exercise
of
the
--
of
the
government's
right
to
change
the
social
security
law.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
your
honor.
i
would
certainly
say
it
couldn't.
i
mean,
i
think
that
wong
wing
proved
--
establishes
the
fact
that
the
alien
has
a
right
to
due
process,
liberty
and
property
and
that
they
cannot
be
taken
away
on
deportation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
it
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
there
is.
there
--
the
--
the
--
it
is
--
it
is
argued
basically.
the
--
the
argument
is
that
this
is
a
punishment
because
of
the
classes
of
deportees
that
are
involved.
this
is
a
punishment
which
is
being
imposed
upon
this
particular
class.
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
unconstitutional
as
lacking
in
due
process.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
there
were
--
there
are
18
classes
of
deportees
and
of
those
14
are
cut
off
and
four
are
not
cut
off.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
you'll
turn
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
the
--
the
deportation
statute
appears
on
page
96
through
101
of
our
brief
and
i
had
marked
the
sections
which
are
the
reasons
for
deportation
which
are
not
--
not
cut
off.
and
the
first
one
is
number
three
on
page
96,
which
is
that
the
person
has
become
a
--
institutionalized
as
a
public
charge
at
public
expense.
that's
number
three
on
page
96.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
not
a
--
he
retained
--
he
still
gets
his
social
security.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
are
14
where
they
cut
off
and
four
where
they're
not
and
i'm
mentioning
the
four
which
are
not
cut
off.
the
next
one
is
number
eight
on
page
100,
eight
on
page
100
which
also
deals
with
becoming
a
public
charge.
and
the
next
one
is
nine
on
page
101
which
is
failing
to
maintain
a
nonimmigrant
status,
it
would
be
a
situation
where
someone
came
in
here
and
--
a
student
or
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
something
like
that
and
went
to
work.
and
the
last
one
is
13
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
101
running
all
to
102
and
that
deals
with
anyone
who
--
within
five
years,
aids
or
assists
another
alien
to
enter
the
united
states
in
violation
of
law.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
really
find
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
difficult
to
make
a
great
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
find
it
--
well,
the
--
the
last
one,
13
and
probably
nine
deal
with
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
nine
and
13
probably
deal
with
violations
of
law.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
probably
a
violation
for
anyone
who's
admitted
as
a
student,
for
example,
to
go
to
work.
at
least,
he
can
--
he's
--
he's
doing
something
he
has
promised
not
to
do.
13
is
definitely
a
--
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they're
not
--
they're
not
as
--
they're
not
in
the
same
class
with
some
of
the
others.
but
on
the
other
hand,
some
of
these
other
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
some
of
the
others
are
also
not
very
serious.
i
--
i
am
not
able
to
find
any
--
the
congress
hasn't
helped
us
in
this.
they
haven't
told
us
why
they
dropped
these
four
out
and
why
they
didn't.
the
--
the
appellant
says
that
this
shows
that
these
are
--
that
the
ones
where
this
cutoff
are
punishments.
i
don't
think
it
shows
that.
i
think
some
of
these
things
where
it's
not
cut
off,
if
it
were
you
could
say
it
was
a
punishment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
won't.
those
are
the
best
we
can
do
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
well,
that
--
that
maybe
--
that
maybe
it,
except
that
hurts
my
case
more
than
it
helps
it,
if
i
may
say.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
from
that
argument,
that's
right.
so,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
see
that
reason
in
the
--
in
the
statute.
it's
the
government's
position
that
congress
can
cut
off
this
kind
of
benefits
for
good
reasons
or
for
bad
reasons,
but
since
these
are
privileges,
you
cannot
cut
them
off
for
reasons
which
are
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
one
could
not
make
--
receive
the
benefits
under
the
social
security
act
depend,
for
example,
upon
race
or
religion
or
upon
politics
because
these
are
bases
of
classification
which
the
--
which
the
constitution
denies
to
congress.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
as
though
they
--
no
reason
why
they
cannot
make
a
differentiation
on
the
basis
of
alienage,
particularly
alienage
when
it's
tied
up
with
an
alien
who
is
no
longer
living
in
this
country.
it's
long
been
recognized
that
if
an
alien
comes
here
and
does
not
undertake
the
duties
of
citizenship
that
he
remains
a
guest
here
and
that
he
doesn't
have
the
full
rights,
privileges
of
--
of
citizens.
he
can
be
deported,
he
can
be
denied
privileges
which
are
given
to
the
people
who
--
who
are
full
citizens.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
there
could
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
could
not
be
a
bill
of
attainder
put
on
him
because
the
constitution
forbids
a
bill
of
attainder
and
the
constitutional
rights
cannot
be
taken
away
from
him,
but
privileges
which
are
granted
to
citizens
as
citizens
can
be
withheld
from
him.
mr.
john
f.
davis
probably
not.
there
are
--
there
are
statutes,
state
statutes
with
respect
to
employment
and
it's
held
that
--
i
don't
know
about
the
statute
of
--
they're
just
practice
of
law
and
probably
could
be
withheld
from
an
alien
as
a
reasonable
thing
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
no,
not
a
--
not
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
the
--
this
court
itself
is
--
is
cast
upon
the
question
of
--
of
taking
away
a
right
to
practice
as
a
--
for
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
if
this
is
a
bill
of
attainder,
if
this
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
a
bill
of
attainder,
this
is
--
this,
we
think,
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
f.
davis
again,
if
this
is
properly
an
ex
post
facto
law,
again,
it
is
unconstitutional
and
it
cannot
be
done.
mr.
john
f.
davis
those
are
the
arguments
that
they
are
making
and
this
in
turn
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
congressional
power
in
connection
with
federal
purposes
and
--
and
the
system
and
the
--
and
the
social
security
system
or
whether
this
is
a
method
of
punishing.
all
of
these
questions
right
to
jury
trial,
ex
post
facto
or
bills
of
attainder,
all
depend
upon
this
being
a
punishment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
--
that's
right.
it
has
--
this
has
to
be
a
penal
statute
in
order
for
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
a
punishment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that
--
that
is
right
to
it,
but
in
any
case,
it
has
to
be
a
punishment.
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
government
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
has
to
be
a
criminal
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right.
but
i
don't
--
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
the
government
cannot
support
this
act
if
this
is
punishment.
i
mean
may
--
it
won't
be
ex
post
facto
but
you
still
have
bills
of
attainder.
you
still
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
due
process
of
law
to
do
it
without
--
without
a
--
a
judicial
trial
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
so
--
so
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
they've
referred
to
the
--
to
the
bills
of
attainder,
whether
it's
ex
post
facto,
i
don't
remember.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
have
read
it
but
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
remember
whether
they
referred
to
ex
post
facto
in
the
coming
states.
i
think
they're
talking
--
they're
almost
entirely
talking
about
bills
of
attainder.
now,
the
position
that
the
government
takes
really
with
respect
to
this
particular
act
is
that
congress
isn't
attempting
to
deter
aliens
from
becoming
members
of
the
communist
party.
it's
not
attempting
to
exact
retributive
justice
against
these
people
for
some
wrong
that
they've
done
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
what
it's
trying
to
do
is
to
do
a
reasonable
--
make
a
reasonable
apportionment
of
social
security
benefits.
it
seems
--
it
seems
merely
absurd
to
say
that
people
should
be
sent
out
of
this
country
because
they're
not
fit
citizens
--
fit
persons
to
reside
here
and
told
to
live
abroad.
and
then
the
taxes
which
are
imposed
upon
workers,
part
of
these
taxes
is
going
to
be
used
to
support
these
people
abroad.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
appropriate
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they've
paid
taxes,
yes.
but
--
as
i
--
as
i
attempted
to
--
to
point
out
a
minute
ago,
there
is
no
direct
connection
between
what
amend
--
taxes
amend
--
pays
now
and
the
social
security
benefits
he's
going
to
receive
when
he
retires.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there's
--
there
are
many
people
abroad
who
are
entitled
to
--
to
receive
social
security
benefits
and
it's
--
that
is
a
much
broader
statement
than
--
than
congress
is
--
it's
gone
much
--
your
--
your
statement
of
--
it
is
much
--
gone
much
further
in
congress
so
far
has
gone.
they
--
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
congressional
policy
of
how
far
they
go.
in
1939,
there
were
some
part
of
social
security
benefits,
shouldn't
be
paid
to
aliens
at
all.
social
security
should
be
only
for
--
for
the
citizens.
and
in
fact,
they
--
it
passed
one
of
the
houses
but
then
it
was
abandoned.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
wouldn't
if
they're
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
if
that
--
if
they'd
been
excluded
from
the
system.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
that
was
abandoned
and
aliens
have
until
1946
been
treated
as
anybody
else
whether
they
--
and
residents
abroad
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
payments
until
this
amendment
in
1954.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
cannot
be
said
to
have
--
enacting
unreasonably
or
--
or
punitively
when
they
determined
that
when
a
man
is
actually
found
to
be
an
unfit
person
to
live
in
this
country
and
he's
told
that
he
must
go
back
home,
that
nevertheless,
he's
going
to
be
sort
of
a
remittance
man
and
he's
going
to
receive
his
--
his
check
from
the
united
states
government
for
himself
so
that
he
can
live
abroad
in
--
in
the
style
of
which
he
has
become
accustomed
here.
it
just
--
it
just
doesn't
--
congress
to
congress,
this
did
not
seem
to
make
sense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
they
excluded
four
classes.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
i
--
this
--
this
gives
some
trouble
but
i
do
not
think
it
does
--
this
particular
appellant
much
good
to
say
that
these
people
should
have
their
rights
cut
off
too.
their
--
the
--
these
four
cases
were
excluded
and
why
they
were
excluded,
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
--
if
this
shows
that
it's
punishment,
if
you
can
get
from
these
four
cases
that
it
is
punishment,
it
does
work
against
--
against
my
argument.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
two
of
the
cases
which
are
excluded
are
--
are
violations
of
law
so
that
it's
not
a
--
they're
not
--
it's
not
just
a
question
of
their
becoming
public
charges
and
it
would
be
consistent
to
cut
it
off
in
that
tax.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
right.
not
as
far
as
the
membership
and
which
is
all
that
was
either
before
this.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
unreasonable
violation
of
the
constitution.
i'm
suggesting
that
even
though
this
is
a
privilege
and
can
be
given
or
withheld
that
the
government
may
not
do
this
for
a
non
sensible,
for
a
--
arbitrary
reasons.
maybe,
i
can
draw
a
comparison
between
this
privilege
and
the
privilege
of
employment.
i
mean,
government
has
a
right
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
due
--
it's
--
it'd
be
lack
of
due
process
if
you
are
arbitrary,
if
you
are
arbitrary
and
unreasonable.
it
might
be
lack
of
due
process
if
you're
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
in
giving
social
security
benefits
to
--
well,
suppose
that
you
should
give
them
to
--
to
everybody
except
red-headed,
take
them
away
from
all
red-headed
men
of
all
people
have
gone
on
odd
days
of
the
months
--
month.
this
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
unreasonable
and
--
and
might
be
considered,
therefore,
to
be
lack
of
due
process
because
if
you're
going
to
give
citizens
--
if
you're
going
to
give
people
rights,
you
should
do
it
on
a
--
on
a
basis
of
equality
and
not
pick
and
choose
on
an
arbitrary
basis.
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
there's
no
constitutional
reason
why
you
shouldn't
give
the
privileges
to
whom
you
want
to
and
take
them
away
from
whomever
you
want
to.
but
i
think
that
the
sound
of
--
a
sound
of
you
is
that
you've
got
to
do
it
on
some
reasonable
basis.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i
think
that
if
this
is
a
penalty
that
it
is
--
that
--
that
the
man
is
entitled
to
--
to
a
trial
before
he's
taken
away,
he's
--
and
it
would
be
considered
to
be
a
--
a
bill
of
attainder.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
no.
they
don't
offer
him
his
money
back.
here
--
there's
no
money
that
--
that
he
has
paid
in
which
is
in
anyway
that
he
has
any
equity
in.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
at
least
specifically
under
the
statute,
there
isn't
any
money
that
he
has
gotten.
this
is
to
be
distinguished,
for
example,
from
the
several
service
retirement
system
where
there
is
also
a
provision
for
forfeitures
in
certain
cases.
and
in
that
case,
it
isn't
a
tax
or
--
or
at
least
a
man
builds
up
a
credit
to
his
account
while
he's
working
for
the
government.
and
on
that
case,
if
they
take
it
away,
the
--
his
money
is
--
is
given
back
to
him,
if
it's
forfeited
for
the
reasons
that
the
statute
provides
for
profit.
but
that
is
to
be
distinguished
from
this
situation
where
he
isn't
building
up
specifically
or
under
the
statute
anyway.
he's
not
building
up
any
credit
to
his
own
account.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he's
paying
into
--
taxes
to
support
the
--
the
social
security
system.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
--
he
hopes
that
someone
will
pay
him
--
in
for
him
when
his
time
comes
and
when
he
retires,
but
that's
a
legislative
matter,
not
a
contractual
matter.
and
he
has
no
choice
about
it
just
as
any
other
tax.
the
system
is
financed
by
a
tax
and
this
tax
is
placed
on
particular
people.
mr.
john
f.
davis
she
--
she
is
a
citizen
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
she
is
a
citizen
and
she
is
still
here
and
she
is
receiving
the
wife's
--
wife's
benefit
at
the
present
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
his
payments.
that's
what
--
actually,
as
far
as
payments
go
if
--
if
--
i
call
your
attention
to
footnote
10
which
appears
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
as
--
if
we
were
going
to
look
at
it
as
a
trust
fund,
i
call
your
attention
to
footnote
10
on
page
33.
on
his
employment
record,
he
apparently
would
have
paid
in
if
all
the
taxes
were
paid,
he
would've
paid
in
$116
in
all.
and
they
have
been
paid
back
to
him
$611.60
and
his
wife
has
received
--
up
to
1959
had
received
$1262.
so
that,
as
far
as
--
actually,
if
you're
going
to
consider
his
payments
in
what
was
going
--
got
back,
he's
--
he
and
his
wife
would
receive
back
what
he
himself
has
received
back,
five
times
what
she
paid
in
and
his
wife
has
received
back
another
10
times
of
what
he
paid.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
my
answer
could
be
that
he
has
received
in
benefits
more
than
he
paid
in
taxes.
i
wouldn't
say
that
he's
been
paid
back,
because
i
think
it's
a
different
matter.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
they
have
no
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
they
have
no
financial
account.
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
have
an
employment
account
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
because
their
payments,
in
order
to
qualify,
they
have
to
show
employment
in
covered
industries.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
have
hours
of
--
they
have
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
--
when
they
qualify,
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
accounts
they
keep
when
they
begin
to
pay
them
the
money.
mr.
john
f.
davis
what
--
what
happens
in
bookkeeping
is
that
the
social
security
administration,
i
think
in
baltimore,
maintains
a
record
of
quarters
of
covered
employment
for
an
individual.
when
a
man
reaches
65,
which
is
the
age
when
he
is
entitled
to
qualify,
he
files
an
application
for
social
security
benefits
and
he
gives
his
social
security
number
and
tells
that
he's
no
longer
employed
of
his
age
and
so
forth
to
show
that
he's
qualified.
they
give
him
a
certificate
of
qualification
or
something
at
that
time
showing
how
much
he
is
entitled
to
on
the
basis
of
his
--
of
their
records
of
his
employment,
the
number
of
quarters
and
the
--
and
the
amount
he's
been
paid
as
wages.
none
of
this
tied
in,
mind
you,
to
the
amount
of
tax
he's
paid
because
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
tax
has
been
paid
or
not.
this
is
done
on
hours
of
--
of
quarters
of
employment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
of
it
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
do
not
think
those
--
those
funds
would
go
to
the
--
to
the
--
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
to
them.
i
think
congress
would
have
to
dispose
of
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
under
any
obligation
to
pay
it
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
you
have
no
question
of
punishment.
that's
the
distinction
i
draw
between
the
general
power
to
amend
or
abolish
and
whether
or
not
this
particular
action
is
an
appropriate
exercise
of
that
power.
and
i
think
they're
two
different
questions
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
i'm
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
can't
believe
it
would
in
--
with
either
of
those.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
punishment.
but
i
would
think
they
could
say,
“we
have
decided
that
farmers
are
no
longer
appropriately
covered
by
social
security.
we'll
take
care
of
them
in
some
other
way
and
we'll
cut
off
all
the
social
security
benefits
for
farmers,”
all
lawyers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
even
if
they
didn't
take
care.
suppose
they
said,
it's
worked
out
badly
to
have
lawyers
under
social
security.
we
haven't
been
able
to
honor
their
books
properly
[laughs]
or
something.
so
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
dentist.
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
it
were
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
they
did
it
on
the
grounds
that
the
man
was
a
communist
or
that
he
had
violated
the
smith
act
or
something
like
that
i
would
--
i
would
feel
that
this
was
a
punishment.
but
here,
what
they
have
done
is
to
say,
“aliens
who
are
deported,
who
are
sent
out
of
the
country,
who
are
no
longer
part
of
our
society.”
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
they
took
almost
all
of
them,
the
--
the
four
classes
that
justice
brennan
and
i
have
difficulty
with
that
they
didn't
take
out
of
it.
but
they
took
14
out
of
the
18
classes
and
said,
“as
to
those,
it's
no
longer
appropriate
that
they
should
receive
it.”
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
--
a
matter
of
judgment
as
to
whether
these
are
generally
the
kind
of
people
that
--
the
kind
of
class
that
falls
within
the
social
security
system.
it
seems
to
me
not
difficult
more
--
not
different
from
this
situation.
if
the
social
security
system
should
say,
“self-employed
people
who
are
gamblers
keep
very
bad
records
and
we
are
having
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
finding
out
what
the
social
security
benefits
of
gamblers
shall
be.”
and
therefore,
we're
going
to
change
our
law
and
we're
going
to
say
that
gamblers
get
no
social
security
benefits.
anyone
who's
--
who's
self-employed
income
comes
from
gambling.
now,
this
isn't
to
punish
gambling.
this
is
because
they
feel
it's
inappropriate
part
of
--
it
doesn't
work
well
in
the
social
--
in
the
social
security
sense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
if
he
were
public
charge.
not
if
he
was
institutionalized
as
a
public
charge.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
here,
if
he
was
deported,
the
--
the
ground
for
deportation
in
section
3
is
if
he
becomes
institutionalized
as
a
public
charge.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
that
man
retains
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
--
that's
the
--
one
possible
basis.
the
other
possible
basis
is
that
these
people
have
been
here
only
less
than
five
years.
it's
a
good
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
but
in
order
to
keep
his
benefits,
he
has
to
have
been
--
he
can't
be
deported
unless
it's
within
the
first
five
years
that
forbids.
that's
right.
this
is
one
of
these
things
that
happened
earlier.
and
congress
said,
“as
to
these
people,
it's
--
it's
not
important
enough
or
we
don't
want
to
impose
the
duty
on
foreign
countries
to
take
care
of
them.
if
we
were
going
to
deport
them,
that's
enough.
and
so,
we
don't
want
to
impose
the
duty
on
foreign
country
to
have,”
maybe
they
thought
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
some
place
to
send
them
that
he
was
going
to
be
charge
abroad
and
they
felt
they'd
have
to
support
him
in
order
to
find
some
place
for
him
to
go.
there
are
a
number
of
explanations.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
he
may
have
paid
very
large
income
taxes
too.
and
he
is
deprived
to
those
rights
too.
mr.
john
f.
davis
whatever
rights
he
has
as
a
resident
of
the
united
states,
rights
for
his
children
to
go
to
school
and
for
--
all
the
rights
which
people
have
that
the
government
finances.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
may,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
--
i
can't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
that's
the
basis
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'll
thinking
about
it
during
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
before
i
stand
on.
mr.
john
f.
davis
by
the
time,
he
was
naturalized,
i
believe.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
--
and
it's
a
basis
for
fraud
in
the
naturalization.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
very
--
the
--
with
respect
to
the
costello
case
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
--
that
for
what
it
--
for
any
importance
there
is.
the
proceeding
is
first,
the
denaturalization
proceeding
on
the
ground
of
some
fraud
which
i
do
not
know
in
connection
with
his
actually
obtaining
citizenship.
then
if
he
is
denaturalized
--
when
he
is
denaturalized,
then
he
would
be
subject
to
deportation
presumably
because
of
commission
of
crimes
involving
moral
servitude
or
that
might
be
the
procedure
but
there
are
two
separate
things,
one,
question
of
whether
he
described
in
his
naturalization,
and
the
second
question,
the
question
of
deportation.
now,
with
respect
to
whether
property
was
taken
away
from
--
from
mr.
nestor,
i
think
it's
important
that
we
not
treat
this
as
though
a
right
to
$55.60
which
had
accrued
to
him
was
taken
away
at
the
time
he
was
awarded
this
benefit
of
$55.60.
the
law
was
then
on
the
books
stating
that
if
he
was
deported
on
the
basis
of
being
--
having
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
this
would
terminate
so
he
took
this
money
at
that
time
subject
to
that
deficients.
the
question
is
whether
his
right
which
existed
in
1954
because
of
the
reason
that
he
had
paid
taxes
under
this
system,
whether
that
is
a
right
at
which
the
deprivation
of
which
is
--
deprives
him
of
due
process
of
law.
