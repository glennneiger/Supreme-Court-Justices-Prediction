mr.
davis,
what
is
the
statutory
characterization
of
these
benefits?
i
had
thought
that
it
was,
number
one,
unemployment
compensation,
and
second,
old-age
benefits.
was
that
not
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
statutory
characterization?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
it's
not
called
insurance,
is
it
or
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
want
compensation
insurance?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
a
--
a
truly
contributory
system
in
the
sense
that
what
you
get
depends
on
dollars
paid?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
there
be,
mr.
rein,
a
limitation
on
the
period
of
his
receipt
of
such
social
security
if
he
had
voluntarily
departed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
period
of
limitation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but,
mr.
rein,
i'm
not
sure
i
follow.
i
understood
you
a
while
ago
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
that
you
do
not
contest
the
government's
contention
that
your
client
had
no
vested
right
in
benefits
under
this
law.
did
i
correctly
i
understand
you
to
say
then?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then,
i
misunderstood
you
in
another
context
then.
i
understood
you
also
to
say
that
you
agreed
that
the
congress
could
amend
and
change
whatever
rights
or
might
be
a
part
of
some
of
the
law.
is
that
the
--
i
misunderstand
you
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
then
would
you
follow
from
that
when
it's
unreasonable
to
amend
in
such
manner
as
would
relieve
the
obligation
to
make
payment
to
a
deportee
that's
unreasonable,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
do
not
follow
that
if
your
client
had
no
vested
right
or
congress
could
change
whatever
right
was
vested,
then
an
exercise
by
congress
of
either
alternative
in
respect
to
the
deportee
would
not
be
punishment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
wonder
if
he's
deprived
if
you
admit
that
the
congress
has
the
power
to
make
these
changes.
that
was
my
point
about
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
was
thinking
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
that's
a
right,
he
--
what
i
have
trouble
understanding
is
how
one
can
be
punished
by
being
deprived
of
the
so-called
--
some
thing
he
never
had.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
long
as
he
was
not
a
deportee.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
congress
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
but
when
you
become
a
deportee,
then
you
shall
no
longer
be
paying.
and
the
congress
has
the
right
to
make
that
change
in
status
or
not.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
just
the
question
i
was
trying
to
set
up,
mr.
rein.
is
this
stipulated
amount
to
be
paid
under
social
security
property
in
the
sense
of
--
used
by
the
court,
district
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
congress
has
the
right
to
change
the
law,
as
i
understood
you,
and
mr.
davis
to
agree,
then
you
certainly
didn't
have
property
in
--
in
a
vested
sense,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
it's
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
it's
--
then
--
then
the
right
to
receive
this
monthly
stipend
stands
in
your
view
in
about
the
same
status
as
a
house
and
lot
to
the
--
on
washington?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
congress
couldn't
take
the
house
and
lot
by
changing
some
law.
that
would
have
to
be
unjust
compensation
if
he
had
a
vested
property
like
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
congress
did
take
it
away
for
reasons
a
and
b,
so
dong
would
not
be
punishment.
i
take
it
you
would
agree
for.
