justice
felix
frankfurter
where
was
the
statute
dealing
with
cutting
off?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
trouble
with
one
more
thing.
this
section
202
(n),
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
in
the
original
enactment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
amendment
to
the
act.
and
up
to
that
--
up
to
that
time,
there
was
no
--
no
provision,
implication
or
anything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
is
subsequent
to
the
beginning
of
his
earned
social
security.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
in
the
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
taxing
the
labor
force,
individuals
are
taxed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
for
each
individual,
there's
a
separate
fiscal
account.
i
don't
know
where
in
social
--
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
their
general
--
to
their
general
fund
that
these
--
the
amounts
collected
both
from
an
employer
and
employee
go
into
a
general
fund,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
but
there
is
a
--
that's
what
i
meant
by
general
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
if
he
--
if
he
--
suppose
he
doesn't
pay
his
taxes,
what
--
what
are
the
consequences?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
that
his
insurance
that
is
the
social
security
benefit
fees,
do
they?
the
government
doesn't
go
at
it
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
overlooked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
good
many
of
the
employees'
taxes
are
paid
by
the
employer,
as
we
know
very
widely.
certainly,
it's
true
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
certain
classes
of
--
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
domestic
belongs
entirely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
further
word
about
the
financing
of
it.
it
is
--
that
the
funds
supposedly
are
expected
to
derive
from
the
tax
on
the
employer
in
the
labor
force.
suppose
to
some
unimaginable
reasons,
each
unimaginable
by
means,
that
those
funds
are
not
sufficient
for
what
under
the
law
required
to
be
the
social
security
benefit.
is
there
an
obligation
under
the
statute
to
pay
out
the
fixed
schedules
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
direct
appropriations
by
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
that
fund
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fund
came
from
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
practical
resources.
suppose
for
some
reason,
there's
a
miscalculation
by
the
secretary
of
treasury,
that's
imaginable
and
there
is
a
deficit,
is
that
--
is
that
automatic
as
congress
appropriates
so
as
to
keep
the
benefits
going?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
the
scheme,
the
scheme
required
appropriations
by
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
132
u.s.?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
great
i
assume.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
want
to
interfere
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
the
orderly
development
of
your
argument
and
--
and
if
my
question
does
postpone
it
until
you
find
it
fitting.
do
you
rely
heavily
on
the
explicit
reservation
of
the
power
to
amend,
to
repeal,
etcetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
except
we
are
told
sometimes
it
is
important
to
spell
things
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
it's
1878.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
fund
is
public
fund
subject
to
the
legislative
control.
justice
felix

and
that
they'll
be

had
no
vested
interest
in
that

we
have
(inaudible)

but
which
could

question
is

are

it
is

there's

those

justice

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice

yes.
justice

certainly,
there's
a
great
deal
of
--
justice

(inaudible)
one,
two,
four,
five
and
others

and
the
other

i
think
there
are

that
are

i
offer
you
those
facts.

law.
(inaudible)
justice

frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
is
more
the
good
things
on.
this
--
it
can't
be
ex
post

unless
you
overruled
all
the
--
the
whole
picture
of
(inaudible)
ex
post

merely
involved
in
criminal
statutes
pursuable
as
a
crime
substitute
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice

it's
not
in
the
loose
sense
a
penal
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
think
that
makes
you
smart
or
heard.
it
has
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
punishment
through
this
criminal
proper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
ex
post

is
different.
i
didn't
say

bill

i'm
talking
about
ex

justice

i'm

(inaudible)
justice

is
it
a
question
that
congress
continued
the
whole
enactment?
justice

now,
what
would
--
is
it
then
clear
that
if
congress
repeals
the

it
would
have
to
distribute
the

that
have
accumulated
among

added?

i
should

congress

the

its

justice

my

my
question
is
directed
to
trying
to
ascertain
what
the
nature
of
this
whole
scheme
is.
justice

and
whether
(inaudible)
mandamus
of
congress
to
pass
an

act
whether
if
he
wanted
moral
obligations
could
be
the
basis
of
(inaudible)
or
--
or
if
it's
a
forfeiture,
whether
you
pursue
it
under
implied
constructions
that
is
--
is
a
deprivation
process
without
confiscations.
justice
felix

i
can't
imagine
it
would.
justice

could
you
tell
me
the
ground
which

of

justice

all
right.
justice

is
there

does
the
word

i

is
there
anything
in

deals
with
procedural
requirements
of
obtaining
what
as
you
call
as

justice

just
tell
me
about
it,
which
one?
well,
i
--
i
want
the

i
want
the
provision

uses

justice

i
know.
justice

mr.

your

you
say
that
congress

speaking
of
its
constitutional
power,
the
united

(inaudible)
unconstitutional,
and
you're
invoking
constitutional
provisions.
and
i
think
when
you're
dealing
with
constitutional
provisions
to
invalidate
the
power
upon
congress
(inaudible)
the
words
of
the
constitution.
and
i
should
like
to
read
you
what
article
iii,
section

you
invoke.
clearly,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
punishment.
(inaudible)
it
says
the
trial
of

crimes,

such
trial
shall
be

shall
have
been
committed

provisions
that
said
punishment,

you
put

prosecution

has

proceeded
