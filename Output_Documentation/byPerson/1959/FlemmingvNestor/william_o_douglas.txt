douglas
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
government
could
--
say
the
state
government
could
confiscate
his
house
and
property
and
his
real
estate?

justice
william
o.
douglas
except
for
the
cummings
and
garland
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
ex
post

think
they
were
--

think
you're

counsel,

were

grounds
for
those
