chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
had
he
been
a
member
of
the
system,
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
illegal
for
him
to
be
a
member
of
the
party
during
the
years
he
was
a
member?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
doesn't
the
act
call
it
insurance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
--
why
then
do
we
have
to
take
the
--
the
tax
definition
of
it
rather
than
insurance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
pay
every
month,
don't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
like
we
do
in
insurance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
to
whom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
get
a
benefit
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
having
paid
it,
whatever
it
might
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
they
get
benefits
in
the
same
sense
here
that
they
do
from
paying
their
income
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
don't
you
have
some
pretty
strong
language
to
get
over
it?
take
your
appendix
a
on
page
89
where
you
quote
the
act.
the
title
of
it
is
“old-age
and
survivors
insurance
benefit
payments.”
old-age
insurance
benefits.
every
individual
who
is
a
fully
insured
individual
in
section
214
(a)
and
has
attained
retirement
age
and
has
filed
an
application
for
old-age
insurance
benefits
shall
be
entitled
to
an
old-age
insurance
benefit
for
each
month
beginning.
that's
a
pretty
strong
language,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
--
you
wipe
that
all
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
by
that
(inaudible)
you
mean
by
that
--
that
we
can
forget
about
whether
it's
insurance
or
a
tax.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
they
ever
cut
off
any
particular
group
before
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
three.
there
are
three
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
sections.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
employee
contribution
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that,
i
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
know
of
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
know
of
any
retirement
system
that
far
back
in
california.
there
had
been.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
that's
was
a
turn
of
the
century,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
could
been,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could've
been
before
back.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
you
to
concede
that
this
is
a
penalty
(inaudible)
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
paying
into?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
talking
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seems
to
me
there's
some
difference
between
congress'
stand
in
the
whole
scheme
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
(inaudible)
to
prove
as
--
as
it
seems
as
to
whether
it
could,
well,
take
away
their
purpose.
now,
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
this
man
is
not
an
alien.
let's
suppose,
this
man
is
a
citizen
and
the
congress
said,
“well,
you
don't
want
me
to
(inaudible)
and
if
they
do,
we
would
deprive
them
of
their
social
security
benefits.”
can
we
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
lawyers
will
[laughter].
let's
take
with
--
the
situation
where
--
where
the
congress
is
taking
away
the
benefits
because
of
--
of
(inaudible)
considering
this
consequence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
congress
has
undoubtedly
considered
along
the
communist
party
as
this
(inaudible)
at
some
time
because
it
--
it
made
the
basis
for
--
for
deportation
and
then
the
(inaudible)
working
out
of
the
deportation
as
before
congress
(inaudible)
provided
that
they
should
take
away
from
all
system
(inaudible)
the
man
was
a
citizen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
can
see
that
what
the
district
is
to
(inaudible)
now,
let's
suppose
that
there
--
there
is
and
to
say
it
(inaudible)
forfeiture
under
exactly
the
same
condition
(inaudible)
and
they
go
back
to
the
same
(inaudible)
wouldn't
the
same
person
be
cut
off?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
say
he
--
you
say,
if
he
was
a
public
charge
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
does
he
lose
his
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
lives
along
--
he
lives
alongside
to
this
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rein.
chief
justice
