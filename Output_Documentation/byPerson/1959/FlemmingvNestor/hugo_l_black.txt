justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
statute
provide
for
any
refunds
to
him
of
what
he's
paid
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
lose
his
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
doesn't
pay
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
particular
payment
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
job
security.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
government
make
any
contributions
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
makes
a
constitutional
distinction
that
they
call
these
payments
taxes
instead
of
something
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
want
to
ask
you
this
just
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
but
are
you
--
is
your
defense
based
wholly
on
the
idea
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
cancel
for
the
reasons
that
exist
in
this
case
or
that
the
government's
right
to
amend
gives
it
the
right
to
repeal
the
whole
law
and
abolish
the
point
if
it
so
desire?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
to
do
a
way
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
allow
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
allow
mentioning
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
that
--
i
understood
you
to
say
they're
not
raising
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
raised
in
lynch
against
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

give
you
less
reasons.
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
this
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
bill
of
attainder
put
on
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
that
be
a
bill
of
attainder
put
on
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
prior
to
the
grant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
this
is
the
right
to
practice
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
as
a
bill
of
attainder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
legislative
acts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
think
that
the
bill
of
attainder,
an
alien
has
a
right
to
protect
himself
against
bills
of
attainder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
bills
of
attainder
had
to
be
a
punishment,
whatever
that
is,
through
the
legislative
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
depending
on
what
you
mean
by
punishment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
moving
against
you,
forfeiting
his
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
remember
--
do
you
remember
whether
they
referred
to
both
ex
post
facto
and
bills
of
attainder
in
some
of
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
read
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
what
it's
going
to
do
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they've
already
--
they've
already
paid
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
--
were
they
required
to
pay
taxes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
requires
an
election.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
about
reasonableness
in
connection
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
on
the
basis
of
some
constitutional
provision
which
permits
reasonable
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
which
constitutional
provision
are
you
relying
on
(inaudible)
are
you
answering?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
case
of
the
law
--
of
that
statute
would
have
any
question
of
the
bill
of
attainder
or
doing
something
that
would
furnish
all
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading
from
now?
