and
this,
i
think
(inaudible)

and
came
into
the
law
after
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
what's
the
$22
billions
in
the
trust
fund
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
just
said
that
the
current
take
takes
care
of
the
current
outlets.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
the
income
falls
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
current
payments
that
is
collected
with
the
taxes
or
what
they
are
from
employees
and
current
collection
rather
and
employers
do
not
aggregate
enough
to
pay
the
benefits
currently
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
demands
for
benefit,
as
i
--
i
gather,
it's
calculated
in
time,
will
exceed
the
tax
payments
by
such
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
amount
that
there
have
to
be
drawings
on
the
so-called
trust
fund,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis,
do
i
correctly
read
your
adversary's
brief
that
they're
not
defending
the
basis
of
the
holding
below,
namely,
that
this
was
a
vested
interest
before
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
don't
claim
that
this
was
a
vested
interest,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
on
the
holding
that
it
was
vested.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
is
--
actually,
mr.
davis,
not
all
classes
of
deportees
were
--
are
cut
off.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
at
least
four
omitted
in
the
original
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
still
not
cut
off.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
cut
off
or
not
cut
off?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
number
three
cut
off
or
not
cut
off?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
still
gets.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
can't
you
say
some
of
the
things
they
--
some
of
things
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
would
say
some
attentive
distinctions
in
your
brief.
are
you
abandoning
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
a
very
good
thing,
probably.
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
hasn't
thought
of
any
of
those.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[laughs]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
penalize
them
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
really
the
argument.
your
adversary
--
there
is
two
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
the
reason
though,
mr.
davis,
namely,
that
americans,
resident
home
earning
--
they're
living
here
and
paying
these
taxes
if
that's
what
they
are,
whatnot
have
to
pay
them
to
contribute
to
support
someone
abroad.
why
doesn't
--
why
would
they
exclude
the
four
classes
they
have
to
exclude
as
deportees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
the
second
--
in
--
they
were
the
four
excluding
classes
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
although
they
are
unfit
persons
by
that
same
testimony.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
trying
to
get
--
i'm
suggesting
that
the
exclusion
of
the
four
cases
rather
undermined
your
--
the
argument
you're
now
giving.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actually,
the
one
we
have
here,
unlike
the
excluded
--
last
excluded
class
which
does,
as
you
suggest,
involve
a
violation
of
law.
from
what
you're
asking
the
chief
justice
before,
the
fact
that
this
individual
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
from
1933
to
1939,
at
that
time,
he
was
not
guilty
of
any
violation
of
the
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
davis,
you
haven't
mentioned
his
wife
if
she's
still
receiving
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
consummates
of
his
payments.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
by
reason
of
his
payment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
why
i
should
have
said
by
reason
of
his
employment.
your
position
is
that
his
payments
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
told
us
a
little
earlier
anyway
that
those
who
are
covered
under
this
program
do
not
--
individually
have
accounts
--
accounts
with

with

brennan,

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

the
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
use
--
use
some
other
professions.
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
for
fraud.
justice
william

subdivision
used.
