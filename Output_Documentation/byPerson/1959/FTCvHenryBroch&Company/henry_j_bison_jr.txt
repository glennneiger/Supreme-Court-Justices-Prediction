mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
express
my
appreciation
to
this
court
and
to
the
solicitor
general
and
to
my
colleague,
mr.
friedman,
for
these
10
minutes
to
address
you.
the
burden
of
my
argument
here
this
afternoon
is
to
examine
the
practical
competitive
effects
of
the
decision
below
within
the
framework
of
the
structure
and
the
marketing
practices
in
food
distribution
and
to
deal
here
with
practical
results.
i'm
representing
here,
your
honors,
the
independent
operators
of
supermarkets
and
food
stores
across
this
land.
the
membership
of
this
association
is
composed
of
local
and
community
food
store
operators
who
operate
small
stores,
supermarkets,
superettes
of
all
kinds.
some
of
them
operate
more
than
one
store,
but
all
are
community
business
people
and
they
buy
their
merchandise
through
voluntary
groups,
through
cooperative
groups
or
retailers
affiliated
together
to
get
cost-efficiency,
so
they
can
buy
merchandise
on
a
plane
of
relative
equality
with
the
large
chain.
some
of
our
members
also
buy
through
independent
wholesalers.
some
of
them
buy
through
--
with
manufacturer
direct.
so,
what
i'm
doing
here
is
really
representing
the
broad
group
of
independent
retailers
as
we
known
to
be
today
whether
they
operate
supermarket
or
one
or
two
stores,
they're
ultimately
business
people.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice,
a
great
many
of
our
people
--
the
majority
of
our
members
are
members
of
what
is
called
the
voluntary
buying
group
or
cooperative
buying
group.
and
that,
of
course,
resulted
because
there's
a
retailers
affiliate
together
and
they're
buying
and
they're
purchasing
that
makes
it
possible
for
them
to
buy
merchandise
on
a
--
on
a
better
basis.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
no,
it
is
not.
i
might
say
that
the
largest
buying
group
in
the
country
today,
your
honor,
sells
to
its
1446
members,
wholesale
$300,000,000.
whereas,
the
largest
chain
--
largest
food
chain
in
united
states,
they
sell
at
retail
$5
billion
and
has
some
4777
stores
and
operates
in
37
states.
so
there's
no
comparison
between
the
purchasing
power
of
the
buying
groups
through
which
independent
purchaser
merchandise
and
the
large
corporate
chain.
the
retailers
that
we
represent
here,
your
honor,
are
buyers
and
they
are
interested
as
much
as
anyone
else
in
purchasing
their
merchandise
at
the
lowest
possible
cost.
and
if
we
thought
that
the
price
reduction
that's
taken
place
in
this
case,
would
come
to
the
independent
merchants
and
they
would
share
on
some
basis
of
equality
with
the
large
chain,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
but
we
know,
we
know
from
history
and
we
know
from
experience
that
the
price
cut
that
we're
talking
about
here
today,
went
by
the
facts
of
this
case,
to
the
one
tremendously
large
buyer
of
apple
concentrate,
500
barrels.
and
the
burden
of
our
argument
today
is
simply
this
that
if
there's
to
be
a
price
cut
which
is
going
to
be
made
on
the
basis
that
all
the
customers
of
this
supplier
going
to
share
and
it
--
and
so
they
can
all
compete
with
each
other
on
some
plane
of
equality
at
the
retail
level,
we
want
it.
but
if
this
is
to
be
a
price
concession
given
to
a
favored
mass
buyer
by
reason
only
of
his
mass
purchasing
power
and
not
by
reason
of
his
efficiency,
then
we
know
that
the
community
store
operators,
the
community
supermarket
operators
are
going
to
be
placed
at
very
severe
competitive
disadvantage.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
the
buyer
was
smucker.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
that
was
a
manufacturer.
but
this
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
apple
butter
and
jams,
jellies,
that
sort
of
thing,
but
the
principle
here
would
apply
to
a
large
chain
and
community
store
operators
buying
apple
butter
or
buying
any
other
because
the
same
principle
would
apply.
that
is
if
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling
is
upheld,
that
seller's
brokers
are
not
covered
by
the
section
2
(c),
then
it's
clear
that
the
large
buyer
can
demand
and
receive
from
a
seller's
broker,
a
substantial
direct
rebate
as
a
part
of
that
--
of
his
commission.
and
our
--
burden
of
our
argument,
your
honors,
is
simply
this,
that
we,
the
community
food
merchants
of
this
country
will
not
get
this
price
cut.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
well,
the
big
buyer
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
i
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
i
understand.
now,
the
big
buyer,
in
this
case,
simply
said,
we
won't
buy
at
anything
but
$1.25.
well,
the
point
that
we
want
to
make
here
is
that
if
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling
is
upheld,
then
the
large
chains
can
say
the
same
thing
knowing
that
the
seller's
broker
representing
tanners
and
representing
processers
in
the
industry,
is
not
covered
by
that
section
and
he
can
make
a
direct
payment
to
the
mass
buyer
and
do
so
outside
of
the
provisions
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
in
some
items,
mr.
justice,
it
is,
in
some
it
is
not.
it
depends
upon
the
sales
practice
of
the
manufacturer
involved.
for
instance,
in
soap,
many
cases
a
--
an
organization,
a
store
that
has
its
own
warehouse
can
buy
direct.
it
depends
on
the
manufacturer's
sales
practices.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
just
like
--
just
like
mr.
broch
did
and
that's
the
point.
you
see,
here's
the
mass
buyer
with
this
tremendous
purchasing
power
saying
to
the
broker,
“well,
sure
i
will
give
you
this
order.
i'd
be
happy
to
give
this
order,
only
i
want
so
much.”
well,
now
all
we're
saying
your
honor
is
simply
this.
if
this
was
a
cost
justified
price
cut,
so
that
it
went
and
reached
community
food
store
operators
across
the
country
equally,
so
that
they
could
compete
with
the
large
chain,
at
the
retailer,
fine,
we
want
to
buy
our
merchandise
at
the
lowest
possible
cost,
but
we
know
that
this
will
never
reach
the
community
food
store
operator
because
it's
only
mass
purchasing
power
which
brings
about
this
rebate
from
the
broker.
now,
these
are
the
realities
that
your
honors
that
you
have
to
consider
in
--
in
dealing
with
this
law
because
this
law
was
passed
to
cure
an
economic
problem
and
mainly
in
from
distribution,
where
competition
between
the
tremendous
buyer
of
$5
million
annual
sales
and
here's
a
little
store
across
the
street
with
sales
of
$350,000
or
$500,000
in
competing
against
a
unit
like
that.
what
you
conceive
they
weren't
rules,
there'd
be
no
possibility
of
--
of
any
--
any
competitive
race.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
i
appreciate
this
opportunity
and
thank
you.
