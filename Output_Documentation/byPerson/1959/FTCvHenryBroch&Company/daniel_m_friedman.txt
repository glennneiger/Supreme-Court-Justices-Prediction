mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
brings
before
this
court
for
the
first
time
since
the
enactment
of
the
robinson-patman
act
in
1936,
the
meaning
of
section
2
(c)
of
that
act,
the
so-called,
“brokerage
section.”
generally
speaking,
that
section
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
pay
or
grant
any
brokerage
or
any
allowance
or
discount
in
lieu
thereof,
to
the
other
party
to
a
purchase
and
sales
transaction
except
for
services
rendered.
the
two
questions
which
are
presented
by
this
case
are
first,
whether
the
prohibitions
of
this
provision
apply
to
a
seller's
broker
who
engages
in
conduct
otherwise
prohibited
by
the
act,
that
is
a
seller's
broker
as
distinguished
from
the
seller
himself.
and
the
second
question
presented
is
whether
the
particular
conduct
engaged
in
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
involve
a
grant
or
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
within
the
meaning
of
those
provisions.
the
basic
facts
in
the
case
are
not
in
dispute.
they
were
found
by
the
examiner,
accepted
by
the
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
itself
in
setting
aside
the
commission's
order,
accepted
those
findings.
the
respondent,
henry
broch
&
company,
is
a
broker
engaged
in
selling
food
products
for
roughly
25
principals.
he
is
compensated
on
the
basis
of
a
percentage
of
the
sales
made
and
the
amount
he
receives
may
vary
from
particular
seller
to
particular
seller.
this
particular
case
grows
out
of
sales
which
the
respondent
made
on
behalf
of
a
canadian
processor
of
apple
concentrate,
a
firm
called,
canada
foods.
and
they
involved
the
sale
of
the
apple
concentrate
that
was
processed
in
1954
to
affirm
in
the
united
states
called
smucker.
in
the
spring
of
1954,
canada
foods
appointed
broch
as
its
broker
and
at
that
time,
entered
into
an
understanding
that
broch
would
be
paid
5%
as
a
commission.
thereafter,
the
--
canada
foods
entered
into
agreements
with
other
brokers
to
represent
it
and
in
those
instances,
they
agreed
to
pay
the
brokers
4%,
the
explanation
being
that
the
broch
firm
stored
the
goods
in
advance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
stored
the
goods,
kept
goods
in
its
warehouse.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
october
of
1954,
canada
foods
announced
to
its
brokers
that
the
1954
pack
of
apple
concentrate
would
be
ready
shortly
and
sent
samples
out
and
indicated
that
the
price
on
this
concentrate
would
be
made
available.
and
around
the
11th
or
13th
of
october,
they
sent
out
an
announcement
to
the
trade
brokers,
the
price
would
be
$1.30
per
gallon
in
50-gallon
drums.
promptly
upon
receipt
of
this
information,
another
broker
who
was
getting
4%
on
the
sales,
a
firm
called
kenser
&
phipps
got
in
touch
with
the
smucker
firm
and
suggested
they
might
interested
in
this
concentrate.
there
was
good
deal
of
discussion
back
and
forth.
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
the
smucker
firm
indicated
they
would
be
interested
in
taking
500
barrels.
now,
this
is
concededly
a
very
large
order,
because
each
barrel
contains
50
gallons,
so
the
result
of
this
is
approximately
25,000
gallons
at
the
price
of
$1.30,
is
better
than
a
$30,000
order.
but
they
further
indicated
to
mr.
phipps
that
they
didn't
want
to
pay
that
much
money
and
mr.
phipps
said
he
would
get
in
touch
with
canada
foods
and
see
what
he
could
do
about
it
and
there
was
further
discussions
back
and
forth
between
canada
foods
and
phipps
and
canada
foods
said,
“no,
they
wouldn't
cut
the
price.”
at
this
point
on,
the
26th
day
of
october,
smucker
made
a
specific
offer
to
phipps.
they
said
they
would
buy
500
barrels
of
their
stuff
at
$1.25.
phipps
promptly
wired
this
offer
to
the
canadian
seller.
the
next
morning,
the
canadian
seller
called
phipps
and
advised
phipps
that
they
would
not
sell
for
less
than
$1.30
and
went
on
and
stated
the
only
way
we
could
do
something
about
it,
would
be
if
the
brokerage
was
cut.
phipps
had
no
inclination
to
do
this
and
that
was
the
end
of
matter
insofar
as
those
negotiations
were
concerned.
now,
the
respondent,
henry
broch
&
company,
entered
the
picture,
a
couple
days
before
these
last
events,
when
it
too,
attempted
to
sell
this
concentrate
to
smucker.
it
got
in
--
its
representative
got
in
touch
with
the
smucker
man
telling
he
was
interested
in
it
and
the
smucker
man
said
that
they
already
had
an
offer
to
buy
this
concentrate
at
$1.30,
but
they
wanted
to
do
something
better.
smucker
told
them
they
were
interested
in
this
large
order
of
500
barrels
and
mr.
broch
indicated
he
would
see
what
he
could
do
about
it.
he
then
sent
a
telegram
--
he
--
i'm
sorry.
he
called
canada
foods
and
indicated
that
he
could
sell
500
barrels
at
$1.25.
the
canada
foods
man
said
he'd
sharpen
his
pencil.
the
next
morning
he
called
him
back
and
said,
“all
right,
you
can
get
this
order
at
$1.25,
but
your
brokerage
will
have
to
be
3%”
and
this
was
accepted
by
mr.
broch
and
the
sale
was
consummated
at
$1.25.
the
$1.25
price
was
given
by
canada
foods
to
this
one
seller
throughout
1954
and
1955.
at
the
same
time,
broch
sold
this
product
to
18
other
customers
at
the
regular
price
of
$1.30
and
on
the
sales
to
the
18
other
customers
they
received
their
regular
commission
of
5%.
similarly
the
three
other
brokers
who
represented
canada
foods
during
this
period
also
sold
at
$1.30
and
received
their
regular
agreement
price
of
4%.
so
that
was
only
on
sales
to
this
particular
purchaser,
smucker,
that
the
lower
price
and
the
lower
brokerage
were
involved.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
there's
no
question
that
this
was
a
very
large
purchaser.
in
fact,
the
manager
of
canada
foods,
when
he
was
conducting
his
negotiations
with
broch
about
appointing
the
broker
said,
he
didn't
think
anyone
in
this
country
to
take
more
than
250
barrels
of
this.
the
commission
held,
on
these
facts,
first
that
the
statute
--
its
prohibitions
do
apply
to
the
seller's
broker,
not
just
to
the
seller
and
secondly,
that
broch,
by
giving
up
a
part
of
the
brokerage,
to
which
it
was
entitled
under
its
agreement
with
canada
foods,
in
order
to
make
possible
the
giving
of
a
lower
price
to
this
particular
buyer,
had
given
an
allowance
or
discount
in
lieu
of
brokerage
in
violation
of
section
2
(c).
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
commission's
order
on
two
distinct
grounds.
first,
it
said
that
section
2
(c)
does
not
apply
to
seller's
brokers
and
secondly,
it
said,
“in
any
event,
broch
did
not
directly
or
indirectly
pay
anything
to
smucker.”
we
believe
that
both
of
these
rulings
of
the
court
below
are
erroneous.
now,
in
construing
section
2
(c),
we
have
to
look
to
the
basic
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
as
we
have
detailed
in
our
reply
brief
and
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
simplicity
case
to
think
the
basic
purpose
and
also
i
might
refer
to
the
morton
salt
case,
the
basic
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act
was
to
make
sure
that
large
purchases
did
not
get
a
competitive
advantage
in
purchasing
over
the
smaller
people,
solely
because
of
the
fact
that
they
had
this
mass-buying
power.
the
original
clayton
act
in
1914
had
suffered
from
a
serious
deficiency
that
it
only
dealt
with
actual
price
discriminations.
and
as
this
court
detailed
last
term
in
the
simplicity
case,
the
large
buyers
were
able
to
find
other
methods
by
which
they
could
obtain
the
same
kind
of
preferences
and
one
of
the
most
prevalent
devices
involved
was
that
of
brokerage.
now,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
concern
of
congress
in
the
brokerage
clause,
the
problems
that
were
presented
to
it
was
things
known
as
bogus
brokerage,
the
situation
in
which
the
seller
either
set
up
a
dummy
corporation
or
appointed
a
clerk
in
his
office
and
said
he
is
my
broker
pay
him
the
brokerage.
that
is
we
--
we
concede
that
is
the
basic
problem
that
was
called
to
the
intention
of
congress
in
dealing
with
brokerage.
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
that
sense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
no,
no.
no,
the
--
the
contention
here
is
that
when
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
commercially
innocent,
but
we
think
in
violation
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
provisions,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
that
sense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
don't
claim
a
kickback
in
that
sense,
but
we
do
claim
that
indirectly,
in
effect,
the
american
broker
passed
part
of
his
brokerage
over
to
the
buyer
by
the
device
of
a
lower
price
made
possible.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
broker,
yes.
we
don't
reach
in
this
case
whether
the
canada
seller
had
violated
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
commission
didn't
proceed
against
it
because
of
the
fact
that
the
canada
company
is
possibly
subject
to
its
jurisdiction,
but
there'd
be
no
effective
way
of
enforcing
an
order
against
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
seller
was
canada
foods.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
broch
was
just
a
broker.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
to
some
extent
at
least
it
--
it's
i
--
it's
a
difficult
question
to
what
extent
2
(a)
and
2
(c)
overlap.
certainly,
to
whatever
extent
the
reduction
in
price
by
the
canada
company
did
not
reflect
the
savings
in
brokerage.
to
that
extent,
of
course,
it's
subject
to
all
of
the
defenses
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
where
the
giving
of
the
commission
was
designed
and
enabled
to
result
in
a
lower
price
to
this
particular
broker.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
we
--
we
think
analytically,
mr.
justice,
this
case
is
no
different
than
if
the
seller
had
charged
his
full
price,
$1.30,
but
then
the
broker
together
with
the
--
the
buyer
had
gotten
into
an
arrangement
and
the
broker
had
rebated
part
of
his
commission.
we
think
in
terms
of
the
basic
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
broker,
that's
right.
we
think
if
a
broker
--
if
a
broker
rebates
part
of
his
commission
directly
to
the
seller,
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
robinson-patman
act
prohibits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
an
--
he's
an
independent
broker.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
we're
not
claiming,
in
this
case,
any
liability
on
behalf
of
the
broker
vicariously
through
the
seller.
this
--
the
means
by
which
we
think
this
violation
was
accomplished
was,
in
effect,
the
passing
through
in
this
roundabout
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
if
in
this
case
the
5%
had
been
paid
over
to
he
broker
and
then
the
broker
had
turned
around
and
given
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
seller.
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
that
when
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
we
think
the
reason
for
that
is
again
in
terms
of
the
basic
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act
which
is
to
protect
the
small
buyers
from
the
fact
that
the
large
buyers
with
their
mass
purchasing
power
are
able
to
exert
pressure
upon
the
sellers
to
get
concessions
not
available
to
others.
in
terms
of
the
end
result
of
what
happens
in
these
cases
where
brokerage
is
passed
by,
as
far
as
the
buyer
who
is
not
the
beneficiary
of
this
thing
--
it
really
doesn't
matter,
we
don't
believe,
whether
the
brokerage
is
paid
over
directly
by
the
seller
himself.
in
other
words,
he
actually
gives
part
of
it
back
or
whether
it's
the
buyer,
the
broker
himself
who
splits
it.
in
either
event,
the
next
consequence
of
this
type
of
arrangement
is
that
the
buyer
who
is
the
large
buyers
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
putting
pressure
upon
the
seller
demanding
concessions
is
able
to
get
something
that
the
smaller
buyer
cannot
receive.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
and
we
claim
it's
the
half
that
the
broker
has
absorbed
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
that
--
that
is
what
we
claim
the
allowance
that
the
broker
has
made.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
and
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
what
i
meant
to
convey
was
that
in
terms
of
the
violation
of
this
section
of
the
act,
it
would
equally
be
a
violation,
whether
the
seller
passed
brokerage
over
or
whether
the
broker
passed
brokerage
over,
because
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
effect,
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
recipient,
the
form
in
which
he
gets
back
some
part
of
the
brokerage
that
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
think
it
would,
mr.
justice,
because
we
think
the
record
here
shows
that
the
broker
as
you
say
did
not
do
it
out
of
the
--
his
own
goodness
of
his
heart,
he
did
it
because
this
was
the
only
way
he
could
close
this
large
deal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
and
we
think
that
congress
has
prohibited
that
kind
of
thing
in
this
situation
because
of
what
we
believed
to
be
the
deleterious
effect
upon
competition.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
section
2
(c)
of
the
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
--
a
difficult
question,
mr.
justice.
let
me
say
that
the
commission
has
never
proceeded
against
a
buyer
under
2
(c),
unless
there
was
anything
--
something
to
indicate
that
he
was
a
knowing
participant
in
the
situation.
in
this
case,
that
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
that
the
smucker,
the
buyer,
did
not
know
what
the
broker's
arrangements
were.
there
have
been
cases,
of
course,
in
which
the
commission
has
proceeded
against
brokers
where
they
were
a
party
parcel
about
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
against
--
against
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
against
--
against
buyers
too,
where
the
buyer
has
received
it.
but
there
it
would
have
to
be,
we
think,
something
more
than
the
mere
passage
over
without
any
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
buyer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
to
--
to
say
--
to
me,
is
the
--
a
very
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
not
--
there's
no
--
there's
not
in
here
that
makes
it
--
puts
on
a
requirement
of
knowingly
on
the
part
of
the
buyer.
on
the
other
hand,
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
in
this
section
to
penalize
the
innocent
buyer
who
gets
the
brokerage
in
--
in
circumstance
where
he
didn't
know
it
was
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
literal
language
of
this
statute
might
possibly
be
construed
to
cover
the
buyer,
but
we
think
in
the
light
of
the
congressional
purpose
that
there's
one
purpose
to
be
served
by
applying
this
statute
to
the
seller
and
to
the
broker
and
that
it's
a
different
situation
when
you
deal
with
the
buyer,
because
we
think
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
making
it
applicable
to
the
receipt
of
brokerage
or
an
allowance
was
to
catch
the
situation
where
the
buyer
knowingly
participates
in
this
situation.
now,
the
statute
insofar
as
the
first
question
of
whether
it
applies
to
the
sellers'
broker
and
not
just
to
the
seller,
and
broadly
would
seem
to
cover
it,
at
least,
on
the
face
of
it
which
is
--
it
says,
“any
person
engaged
in
commerce,”
this
is
page
2
of
our
brief,
“makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
pay
or
grant,
anything
of
value
at
the
commission,
brokerage
or
any
allowance
or
discount
in
lieu
thereof,
to
the
other
party
to
a
purchase
and
sales
transaction.”
well
any
person
certainly
includes
a
broker,
isn't
limited
to
the
seller
and
we
think
that
the
--
on
the
side
of
the
transaction,
the
other
party,
the
transaction
this
situations
of
the
buyer.
now,
we
also
believe
that
this
construction
is
further
supported
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
also
by
what
we
think
would
be
a
serious
loophole
in
the
act,
if
it
were
held
not
applicable
to
sellers'
brokers.
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
one
other
thing
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
is
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with
the
basic
act
of
passing
over
brokerage.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
significance
is
to
make
--
to
make
it
clear
that
it's
intended
to
reach
the
passing
over
of
brokerage
between
the
seller
side
on
the
one
hand
and
the
buyer
side
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
buyer.
the
other
party
to
the
transaction
here
is
the
buyer.
the
theory
is
that
the
broker
in
this
case
granted
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
to
the
buyer
when
he
accepted
a
lower
price.
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
even
though
the
buyer
knew
nothing
of
it.
and
that
was
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
as
to
whether,
in
this
situation,
the
buyer
was
--
had
violated
this
section
whether
it's
very
dubious.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think,
in
a
sense,
you
may
say
there
were
three
parties
to
this
transaction.
on
the
one
side
is
the
buyer
and
on
the
other
side
is
the
seller
and
the
broker.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he's
--
he's
just
a
broker,
but
he
was
certainly
a
party
in
the
sense
that
he
was
an
active
participant
in
it.
it
doesn't
--
mr.
justice,
this
does
not
limit
it
to
sellers
or
buyers.
it
uses
broader
language
and
now
we
think
that
it
was
intended
to
get
everyone
of
these
situations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
and
we
think
the
other
party
to
--
if
it
speaks
of
the
other
party
to
such
transaction
and
the
other
party
to
such
transaction
to
the
sale
transaction,
we
submit,
is
the
buyer
and
if
the
buyer
to
whom
the
brokerage
was
paid
over.
now,
if
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
correct
and
that
this
only
applies
to
a
seller,
and
not
to
a
seller's
broker,
this
could
lead
the
way,
we
think,
to
a
serious
loophole
in
the
act
because
as
i've
indicated
previously,
if
all
that
is
prohibited
here
is
the
passing
over
of
brokerage
by
the
seller,
a
seller
can
charge
the
buyer
his
regular
price,
but
then
an
arrangement
can
be
entered
into
without
knowledge
to
the
seller
between
the
broker
and
the
buyer.
in
other
words,
the
broker
can
say
to
the
buyer,
“well
you
make
the
transaction
at
$1.30
at
the
regular
price,
but
after
i
get
my
commission,
i'll
pass
some
of
it
over
to
you.”
now,
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
--
is
precisely
again
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
was
concerned
with
in
the
robinson-patman
act.
this
business
of
a
large
buyer
being
interested
in
getting
a
lower
price
and
he
doesn't
care
how
we
gets
it
and
the
seller
because
of
the
large
size
of
the
order,
because
of
the
fact
that
he's
dealing
with
the
big
buyer,
gives
him
a
concession
which
is
not
available
to
the
others.
now,
it's
the
same
basic
policy
which
we
think
further
supports
the
commission's
alternative
point
here,
the
other
ground
which
was
objected
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
in
the
circumstance
to
this
case,
broch
actually
granted
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage,
when
in
order
to
make
possible
the
sale
to
this
particular
large
buyer,
he
accepted
less
than
his
agreed
upon
rate
of
commission.
several
things
are
--
must
be
recognized
here
that
he
did
have
an
agreed
upon
rate
of
commission.
the
contention
was
made
before
the
commission
that
there
was
no
fixed
5%
rate
of
commission.
that
it
was
subject
to
confirmation
and
negotiation
in
each
sale,
but
didn't
apply
to
large
sales
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that‘s
right.
in
circumstance,
if
i
may
add
one
thing
mr.
justice,
in
circumstances
where
it's
clear
that
the
acceptance
of
the
lower
brokerage
was
the
sine
qua
non
of
the
lower
price
from
the
seller
to
the
buyer.
now,
i
--
i
think
it's
significant
to
point
out
that
in
this
very
case,
at
the
--
the
same
day
that
this
arrangement
was
entered
into
with
broch,
the
seller
rejected
the
offer
of
phipps,
the
other
broker
for
$1.30
and
said
to
him,
you'll
have
to
cut
the
brokerage.
that
was
the
end
of
it.
so
that,
this
is
not
a
case
where
there's
just
a
coincidental
reduction
of
brokerage
and
then
at
some
later
time
there
is
a
reduction
in
price.
this
is
directly
and
intimately
connected.
that
one
would
not
have
happened
without
the
other.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
particular
--
and
then
there
was
a
reduction.
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
because
the
commission's
position
is
that
whenever
a
brokerage
is
--
whenever
an
allowance
is
made
to
the
seller
requesting
a
lower
price
in
lieu
of
brokerage,
when
you'd
find
this
causal
connection
between
the
reduction
in
brokerage
and
the
passing
on
that
is
what
is
prohibited
by
section
2
(c).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
we
think
that
the
court's
justification
provisions
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
2
(c)
and
if
a
particular
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
is
prohibited
by
2
(c),
we
don't
think
they
can
then
turn
around
and
treat
it
as
an
item
of
cost
saving
under
2
(a).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
in
this
--
in
this
very
case
for
example,
broch
received
5%
and
the
other
brokers
received
4%.
it
depends
basically
on
what
the
arrangement
is.
a
seller
is
perfectly
free
to
enter
into
an
arrangement
with
his
broker
to
negotiate
from
transaction
to
transaction.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
cannot
adjust
it
from
--
he
cannot
adjust
it
from
sale
to
sale
if
what
he
is
doing
is
passing
on
the
particular
savings
in
brokerage
in
the
particular
case.
he
can,
of
course,
enter
into
any
arrangements
he
wants
with
his
broker.
he
can
say
to
a
broker,
“on
large
sales
you're
only
going
to
get
3%.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
as
long
as
the
price
is
the
same,
as
long
as
he
charges
$1.30
to
everybody,
it
doesn't
matter
what
he
pays
this
particular
broker
on
a
particular
sale,
but
as
soon
as
he
takes
the
savings
to
the
brokerage
on
a
particular
sale
and
uses
that
as
the
means
for
passing
over
a
reduction,
a
lower
discriminatory
--
lower
price
to
a
particular
buyer,
then,
we
think,
he
runs
afoul
of
section
2
(c).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
if
we
could
have
gotten
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
suggest
that
the
seller,
in
this
case,
may
also
have
violated
section
2
(c).
now,
as
he
--
he
also
was
a
participant
in
passing
over
this
brokerage.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
--
he
was
the
one
who
himself,
of
course,
made
the
lower
price
avail
--
no,
they
both
had
to
pass
over.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
gave
him
a
part
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
we
don't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
we
believe
that
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
when
you
--
because
brokerage
in
the
past
had
been
so
susceptible
of
abuse,
has
been
so
abused,
congress,
we
think,
has
made
the
determination
that
when
it
comes
to
brokerage,
you
cannot
pass
it
on
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
other
party.
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
hasn't.
on
the
other
hand,
the
committee
reports
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
do
use
that.
it
hasn't
said
it
indirect
--
directly
or
indirectly
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
we
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
committee
reports,
we
think
that
fairly
read,
granting
brokerage
or
an
allowance
or
discount
in
lieu
thereof
includes
not
just
a
payment
over
of
money,
but
also
this
kind
of
thing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
it's
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
we
think
that
the
--
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
suggest
that
this
indirect
payment
is,
in
fact,
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
paid
the
full
brokerage?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
wouldn't
be
--
you
mean
if
the
seller
had
reduced
his
price
by
five
cents.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
he
couldn't
--
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice,
he
could
claim
cost
justification,
unless
he
showed
that
he
was
paying
less
brokerage.
now,
the
--
the
problem
of
cost
justification
arises
where
the
broker
takes
a
lower
commission
and
then
the
seller
reduces
his
price
accordingly
and
claims
of
a
cost
justification
that
his
cost
will
lessen
this
sale
because
he
paid
less
brokerage.
now,
i
also
want
to
emphasize
something.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right
and
we
don't
--
we
don't
believe
in
this
--
in
this
kind
of
situation
that
the
seller
can
cost
justify,
can't
treat
as
a
--
item
of
cause
which
may
be
justified,
the
fact
that
he
pays
a
lower
brokerage,
which
in
then
in
turn
is
passed
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
apple
concentrate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
no,
because
that
would
be
cost
--
cost
justifying,
but
in
this
situation
what
he
did
was
--
this
is
a
situation
which
we
think
that
there
are
no
inherent
economy
that
manufacturer
a
production.
this
is
a
case
where
the
brokerage
which
is
when
element
of
the
transaction
was
reduced
and
it
was
reduced
from
a
situation
where
in
effect,
the
broker
we
think
has
part
of
it
in
over.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
half
of
it,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
don't
know
because
we
didn't
proceed
against
the
seller
and,
of
course,
the
seller
is
a
canadian
company.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
point
--
two
other
points
briefly.
the
first
of
it
is
that
broch
repeatedly
suggests
that
called
this
an
open
discrimination,
one
which
he
said
is
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
invoices,
not
a
case
were
they
purported
to
pay
--
charge
$1.30
and
then
secretly
sneak
something
in
under
one
guise
or
the
other.
here,
admittedly,
they
cut
it
down
to
$1.25
and
he
suggests,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
brokerage
clause
was
intended
to
reach.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
he
says
an
open
price
reduction,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
of
course,
when
he
said
this
was
open,
this
wasn't
open
in
the
sense
that
anybody
knew
about
it.
when
this
kind
of
favoritism
takes
place,
it's
not
generally
announced
and
in
fact,
after
the
buyer,
the
competing
broker
phipps
discovered
what
it
happened
when
he
found
out
that
his
sale
had
been
lost
to
other
broker,
he
wrote
to
the
seller
and
asked
him
whether
he
said
he
was
very
surprised
with
this
and
he
said
he
hoped
that
all
the
other
brokers
were
getting
the
same
price.
and
they
weren't
being
treated
on
more
favorably
and
at
this
point,
the
seller
justified
that
the
he
didn't
answer
this,
but
phipps
subsequently
testified
that
in
a
later
phone
conversation
with
the
broker
he
asked
the
broke
--
the
seller
rather,
phipps
asked
the
seller
whether
in
fact
the
price
was
still
$1.30,
if
anyone
would
get
less
and
this
man
said,
“no,
everyone's
paying
$1.30.”
now,
finally,
i
want
to
discuss
the
arguments
strongly
pressed
here
by
the
respondent
and
relied
on
by
a
court
of
appeals
which
is
that
--
they
said
that
--
and
they
argue
here
that
this
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
federal
trade
commission
contravenes
what
they
call
broad
general
national
antitrust
objectives.
the
argument
is
that
this
has
the
effect
of
freezing
brokerage
commission.
that
since
you
can't
adjust
them
down
and
wouldn't
pass
it
on,
this
is
directly
contrary
to
the
basic
premise
of
the
sherman
act,
favoring
free
and
vigorous
competition.
the
answer,
we
think,
to
that
is
basically
a
simple
one
which
is
that
while
there's
this
general
policy
of
favoring
vigorous
competition,
nonetheless,
congress
has
made
the
determination
that
there
is
certain
types
of
competition
that
in
the
long
run
will
harm
rather
than
further
the
competitive
system.
types
and
practices
which
result
in
the
large
buyer
being
able
to
get
a
competitive
advantage
over
the
smaller
one,
and
thus
we
think
that
what
congress
has
done
in
this
statute
is
to
say
that
there's
an
exception
to
the
general
policy
of
competition,
the
exception
is
that
there
are
certain
types,
certain
specific
practices
which
must
be
proscribed.
and
one
of
those
practices
is
the
passing
on
of
brokerage
directly
or
indirectly,
we
think,
the
passing
of
brokerage
to
the
buyer,
to
the
large
buyer
in
this
situation
where
the
buyer
is
able
to
get
this
benefit
not
accorded
to
the
others,
not
as
the
result
of
any
superior
efficiency
of
its
own
operation,
but
solely
as
the
result
of
his
superior
purchasing
power.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
clearest
evidence
of
the
solicitor
general's
support
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
he
saw
in
the
brief
and
that
i'm
arguing
this
case.
i
think
all
of
this
was
intended
to
mean
was
that
in
supporting
the
commission's
position
in
this
case,
in
indicating
what
we
believe
to
be
the
legislative
purpose
in
this
act,
the
department
of
justice
was
not
indicating
any
views
of
its
own
as
to
the
wisdom
or
lack
of
wisdom
of
the
policy
consideration
that
underlies
this
legislature.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
of
any
particular
comment
like
this,
but
the
solicitor
general
on
the
past
has
indicated
certain
reservations
as
to
the
positions
taken.
i
don't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
i
think,
mr.
justice,
it
was
only
intended
to
indicate
that
the
department
of
justice
is
not
taking
any
sides
in
this
basic
controversy.
it
has
assisted
for
long
time
as
to
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
many
of
the
features
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
are
here
as
counsel
for
the
federal
trade
commission.
we're
presenting
to
the
court
what
we
believe
to
be
the
policy
reflected
in
the
robinson-patman
act
and
we
believe
that
the
policy
reflected
in
the
robinson-patman
act
is
furthered
by
the
commission's
construction
of
the
statute
in
this
case.
we
are
here
as
an
active
litigant
not
as
an
amicus.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
is
not
an
unprecedented
event
before
this
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
antitrust
division
has
in
the
past
sometimes
not
appeared
in
federal
trade
commission
cases.
two
recent
cases,
i
might
mention
the
automatic
canteen
case
and
the
national
casualty
insurance
case
two
years
ago.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
--
for
example,
the
attorney
general's
committee
has
been
somewhat
critical
of
the
position
taken
by
the
federal
trade
commission
in
various
aspects
of
robinson-patman
act
administration.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it's
the
duty
of
the
department
to
administer
the
acts
as
they
appear.
now,
i
would
like
to
first
answer
a
point
that
mr.
rowe
has
made
several
times.
he
refers
to
the
statement
by
senator
logan
in
which
senator
logan
re-explained
why
the
early
draft
of
the
bill
which
contained
an
exception
for
other
than
brokerage
in
connection
with
cost
justification,
why
that
was
deleted
and
he
refers
in
his
brief
at
pages
30
and
31
to
this
statement
by
senator
logan
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
unfortunately,
we
had
not
quoted
the
material
that
i
am
about
to
read
to
the
court
but
it
is
set
forth
in
the
conference
committee
report
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
its
house
report
number
2951
in
the
74th
congress,
2nd
session
page
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
cited
in
other
context,
mr.
justice.
it's
cited
pages
17,
for
example
--
i'm
sorry
--
page
8
--
top
of
page
18.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
6
of
the
conference
committee
report.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
--
at
the
top
of
page
18
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
report
number
2951,
where
we
say
page
7.
i'd
like
to
read
one
sentence
from
page
6
of
that
report
and
that
statement
states
that
“the
words
other
than
brokerage
which
appeared
in
the
senate
amendment
immediately
after
the
word
cost
are
eliminated
for
the
reason
that
the
matter
of
brokerage
is
dealt
with
in
a
subsequent
subsection
of
the
bill.”
now,
we
think
that
this
statement
means
only
and
can
mean
only
one
thing
that
congress
found
it
unnecessary
to
specify
other
than
brokerage
as
a
cost
defense
because
it
was
dealing
with
the
problem
of
brokerage
in
a
specific
section.
and
in
a
specific
section,
it
took
up
the
problem
of
brokerage
and
imposed
a
blanket
prohibition
that
a
grant
or
allowance
of
brokerage
or
an
allowance
in
lieu
thereof
was
to
be
prohibited.
now,
mr.
justice
black
inquired
of
my
opponent,
what
the
practical
affect
of
what
was
done
here
is.
well,
i
think
the
practical
effect
is
very
clear.
it's
undisputed
from
this
record
what
the
practical
effect
is.
one
buyer,
only
one
buyer
and
admittedly,
a
large
buyer
was
true,
as
mr.
rowe
indicates,
this
isn't
a
mass
of
chain
store
but
this
is
the
only
buyer
in
this
industry
who
could
make
a
purchase
of
this
size.
this
one
buyer
got
a
lower
price
which
was
not
given
to
anyone
else,
neither
to
anyone
else
by
mr.
broch,
who
had
18
other
customers
or
by
any
of
the
other
brokers.
so
the
practical
effect,
i
think,
of
this
action
here
is
very
clear.
this
is,
we
think,
is
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
the
congress
wished
to
reach
under
the
brokerage
clause
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
use
--
the
manipulation
of
brokerage
as
a
device
to
give
a
large
buyer
with
greater
purchasing
power
a
competitive
advantage,
a
lower
price
which
is
not
available
generally
to
all
of
the
other
buyers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
first
case
of
this
kind.
there
have
been
at
least
three
other
cases
in
which
the
commission
has
proceeded
against
sellers'
brokers
but
this
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is,
to
my
knowledge,
the
first
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice,
but
i
--
i
can
suggest
this,
that
the
record
shows
that
when
the
other
broker
in
this
case
had
it
suggested
to
him
by
the
seller
that
the
only
the
price
could
be
reduced
would
be
if
the
brokerage
was
cut.
he
refused
to
do
that
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
buyer
in
this
case
stating
that
the
only
way
we
could
confirm
would
get
us
in
trouble
under
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
i
suspect
that
one
reason
for
the
paucity
of
these
proceedings
maybe
the
previous
general
view
we
believe
in
the
industry
that
this
kind
of
thing
was
prohibited,
that
the
broker
could
not
take
a
lower
price
which
was
the
means
a
lower
commission,
which
was
the
means
of
giving
a
price
discrimination
to
a
favored
buyer.
but
i
--
i
can't
answer
specifically
as
to
how
extensive
this
practice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
--
no,
mr.
justice.
if
the
seller
can
give
a
lower
price
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
mean
in
dealings
with
the
sellers?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
broker
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
broker
can
--
can
do
any
--
when
he
is
employed
by
a
seller,
he
can
say,
“i
want
6%
commission,
i'm
willing
to
work
for
4%
or
3%.”
that
--
that's
perfectly
would
--
completely
up
to
the
broker
and
the
seller,
whatever
arrangement
they
make
as
to
commission,
but
our
point
is
once
they
have
reached
an
agreement
as
to
commission
and
here
they
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
--
with
the
seller.
once
they
have
reached
that
agreement,
they
cannot
then
take
part
of
that
commission
in
dealing
with
the
favorite
purchaser
and
pass
part
of
it
back.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
in
--
in
that
case,
mr.
justice,
i
doubt
that
you
have
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
because
they
are
your
basic
brokerage
statement
but
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
you
had
an
agreement
for
5%
and
in
every
other
transaction
except
for
this
one
purchase,
5%
was
paid.
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
--
but
the
statute
--
insofar
as
the
broker
is
concerned,
the
statute
prohibits
the
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
and
where
you
have
situation
where
there's
nothing
to
be
in
lieu
of,
in
other
words,
where
there
is
no
brokerage
to
be
passed
over
but
in
--
as
i
repeat
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
that
situation.
also
i
like
to
refer
very
briefly
to
the
robinson
case
which
my
opponent
relies
on.
there
again
is
a
case
where
we
think
its
clear
that
there
was
no
violation
of
--
to
see
charge
because
there
was
nothing
to
show
any
correlation
between
the
brokerage
passed
on
and
the
lower
price.
the
court
specifically
stated
in
the
opinion.
there
is
--
incidentally
the
court
says,
“no
allegation
of
any
correlation
and
amount
between
the
reduction
in
price
in
plaintiff's
former
commission.
furthermore,
the
court
says,
“since
there
is
no
indication
that
employer
employed
other
brokers,
we
take
plaintiff's
stated
claim
to
be
that
all
customers
thereafter
are
not
merely
(inaudible)
purchased
direct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
have
the
official
report.
my
adversary
cites
the
trade
regulation
service
citation
in
his
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
december
10th,
1959,
an
opinion
by
judge
aldrich
and
in
that
opinion,
incidentally
in
the
footnote,
judge
aldrich
expresses
some
doubt.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
judge
bailey
aldrich,
expresses
some
doubt
as
to
the
broch
decision
in
the
circuit
court
in
this
case.
so
that
--
one
final
word,
in
--
in
recapitulation,
we've
been
accused
in
this
case
of
construing
the
statute
in
a
way
it
leads
to
it
--
stabilizing
brokers,
it's
claimed.
this
is
in
effect
condoning
price
fixing
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
now,
congress,
we
think,
has
made
the
determination
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
price
practices
which
in
the
long
run
is
so
injurious
to
the
competitive
system
that
they
must
be
prohibited
outright,
and
we
think
one
of
those
prohibitions
made
by
congress
is
that
when
you
get
into
the
brokerage
field,
the
broker
cannot
take
and
pass
over
some
of
his
brokerage
to
the
favorite
purchaser.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
said
--
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
as
--
as
a
--
in
a
--
in
practical
effect,
mr.
justice,
we
think
it's
the
same
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
effect
on
the
purchaser
whether
he
has
done
that
or
whether
he's
actual
taken
the
money
and
passed
it
over
in
so
many
--
so
many
terms.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
but
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
but
i
think
the
phrase
in
the
statute
and
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
--
if
--
if
i
am,
mr.
justice,
it's
an
attempt
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
so
found
and
that
finding
--
was
accepted
by
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
he's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
he
didn't.
to
all
that
is
shown
by
the
record
is
that
he
came
to
the
manufacturer
and
said
to
the
manufacturer,
“i
can
sell
a
large
order
at
$1.25.”
the
manufacture
said,
“well,
let
me
figure
about
this.”
and
then
he
--
manufacturer
came
back
the
next
morning
and
said,
“you
can
make
the
order
--
sell
the
order
at
$1.25,
but
you'll
have
to
take
3%
brokerage
on
this
order,”
that's
all
that
we
have
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
instead
of
5%
and
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
there
is
no
question
that
on
all
other
transactions
through
this
broker
and
through
every
other
broker,
the
stated
agreed
upon
brokerage
was
paid
5%
from
mr.
broch,
4%
through
all
the
other
brokers,
which
was
their
agreement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
before
and
after,
before
and
after
on
the
dealings
by
mr.
broch,
he
paid
5%
with
all
his
other
customers.
thank
you.
