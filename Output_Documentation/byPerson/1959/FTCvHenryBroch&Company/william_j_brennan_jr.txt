the
absolute
only
pressure
the
buyer
put
on
anyone
here
was
to
pay
$1.25
and
not
$1.30.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
actually
the
extent
of
which
that
five-cent
difference
is
made
up
was
that
the
vendor
absorbed,
in
effect,
half
of
it
than
the
broker
--

william
j.
brennan,

absorbed
the
half.

but
the
issue
is
whether
that
does
violence
(voice

and
(inaudible)
specific
to
our
facts,
passage
over
by
the
broker
himself
--
justice

j.
brennan,

so
the
buyer
and
not
the
seller.

and
the
way
there'd
be
a
conflict
in
it
by
the
views
of
the
seller
or
by
a
deduction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
he
accepts
3%
instead
of
the
5%.
