mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
brief
time
available
to
me,
i
would
like
to
bring
back
the
somewhat
atmospheric
discussion
to
the
issues
presented
by
this
case
before
the
court
and
try
to
cover
briefly
some
of
the
points
raised
by
the
questioning
of
several
of
the
justices.
first,
both
the
commission
and
the
amicus
curiae
supporting
the
commission
on
this
case,
have
invaded
vigorously
and
vehemently
against
the
so-called
big
buyer,
his
exactions,
his
discriminations
and
his
coercions.
i
think
this
makes
it
all
--
almost
conspicuous
and
prominent
in
this
case
that
is
not
a
case
against
the
big
buyer.
the
commission
on
the
--
in
this
case,
in
fact,
desisted
and
refrained
from
invoking
the
applicable
prohibitions
of
the
act
on
the
price
differentiations
and
cases
against
buyers
and
sellers
and
instead
resorted
here
after
20
years
of
administration
of
the
robinson-patman
act
to
an
unprecedented
theory
never
before
even
tendered
to
a
court
whereby
a
broker
accepting
a
smaller
rate
of
commission
in
a
competitive
situation
is
charged
with
in
making
--
making
a
so-called
indirect
payment
by
him
over
to
the
seller,
over
to
the
buyer
and
all
the
time,
the
buyer
didn't
know
it
and
the
seller
didn't
know
it.
the
court
inquired
as
to
the
possibilities
of
the
cost
justification,
if
a
case
had
been
brought
against
the
seller
on
these
facts
and
i
believe
it
was
mr.
friedman's
explanation
that
in
a
case
of
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes,
sir.
in
the
statute,
there
is
a
section
governing
the
receipt
of
price
variations
by
buyers,
section
2
(f)
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
automatic
canteen
case
2
(f),
yes.
and
once
again,
just
in
the
case
of
a
suit
against
the
buyer
for
paying
a
lower
price
if
a
suit
had
been
brought
against
the
seller
for
receiving
a
lower
price,
it
would
have
been
perfectly
obvious
that
there
would
have
been
no
violation
whatsoever
of
the
statute,
because
the
open
price
reduction
here
at
bar,
had
all
the
earmarks
of
legality,
if
tested
by
the
standards
of
these
provisions.
namely,
it
is
clear
in
the
record
that
there
were
significant
cost
economies
to
the
seller
in
making
this
transaction
and
in
making
this
sale,
because
as
he
testified
and
there's
no
contradiction
of
that
in
the
record,
they
were
savings
in
freight,
savings
in
processing,
savings
in
customs
and
saving
in
the
brokerage
commission.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes,
sir.
they
are
available
under
2
(f),
because
under
the
law
of
2
(f),
it
requires
an
illegal
transaction
by
the
seller
to
the
buyer
to
also
charge
the
buyer
with
the
legality.
i
believe
that
there
was
also
a
suggestion
that
the
price,
the
lower
price
given
to
the
buyer
could
not
have
been
cost
justified.
i
don't
know
whether
there
was
any
further
explanation
of
why
not,
but
certainly
the
theory
that
a
price
reduction
could
not
be
cost
justified
by
reference
to
savings
and
brokerage
commissions
would
read
out
of
the
act
the
express
proviso
whereby
congress
guaranteed
that
the
economies
of
distribution
could
be
reflected
on
lower
prices
to
the
consumer
and
there
was
no
exception
for
these
economies
insofar
as
brokerage
commissions
were
concerned.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
proposal
to
that
effect
addressed
to
congress
in
1936
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
there
was
a
proposal
before
the
committee
to
accept
from
the
permissible
cost
savings,
those
costs
attributable
to
broker's
fees
and
that
provision
was
stricken
from
the
statute
in
conference.
i
have
in
our
brief
the
explanation
for
the
action
by
senator
logan
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
considering
the
bill
and
who
was
the
senate
manager
of
the
bill.
senator
logan
explained
to
the
senate
at
that
time,
in
the
second
section
of
this
committee
amendment
of
the
provision
that
in
making
the
--
a
discrimination
or
differentials
or
whatever
who
may
choose
to
call
them,
all
costs
other
than
brokerage
shall
be
allowed
and
it
has
been
said
that
the
words,
“other
than
brokerage,”
in
that
section
ought
to
go
out.
i
have
thought
a
good
deal
about
that
suggestion.
i
think
that
perhaps
legitimate
brokerage
ought
to
be
allowed
as
a
part
of
the
costs
and
i
think
when
the
bill
was
drafted,
i
did
not
write
the
bill,
perhaps
in
the
amendment
which
was
inserted
by
the
committee
we
had
in
mind
dummy
brokerage,
sham
brokerage.
in
other
words,
this
provision
was
stricken
out
by
the
conference
committee
and
we
believe
completely
deflates
the
suggestion
which
has
been
tendered
here
that
a
seller's
price
reduction
for
some
reason
unexplained
in
the
statute
and
perhaps
referenced
to
the
basic
policy
rather
than
a
text,
may
not
be
justified
by
reference
to
cost
economies
just
as
any
other
economies
of
distribution
when
a
seller
makes
a
price
to
a
buyer.
what
we
have
in
this
case
your
honors
is
in
effect,
an
unprecedented
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
whereby
the
commission
would,
in
effect,
render
illegal
a
competitive
price
reduction
which
would
be
cost
justified
and
lawful
under
section
2
(a),
if
it
had
been
proceeded
against,
as
it
should
have
been
properly,
against
the
parties
to
the
transaction.
and
it
has
done
this
by
invoking
this
novel
theory
whereby
a
seller's
broker
is
charged
with
making
an
illegal
rebate
by
accepting
a
lower
commission
and
then
this
lower
commission
then
somehow
gets
on
over
to
the
buyer
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
lower
price
by
the
seller.
we
believe
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
this
theory
has
been
urged.
we
believe
this
theory
has
no
relationship
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
to
the
congressional
purpose
as
expressed
in
the
legislative
reports
as
we
have
it
and
also
to
the
policy
of
the
robinson-patman
act
which
has
been
adverted
to
--
by
counsel
for
the
commission.
this
court
very
recently
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
is
not
covered
at
all
by
the
literal
language
of
section
2
(c).
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
was
an
open
competitive
price
reduction,
mr.
justice
stewart,
which
if
at
all,
should
have
been
proceeded
against
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute
governing
price
variations.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
do
not
agree
with
the
commission's
premise
that
this
was
a
finding
of
fact
because
the
commission
when
it
rendered
its
opinion
treated
this
as
a
legal
conclusion
on
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
as
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes,
sir.
if
there
had
been
in
truth
and
fact,
in
this
case,
which
there
was
not,
an
actual
taking
of
money
by
the
broker
out
of
his
pocket
and
paying
it
over
to
the
buyer
who
obviously
in
such
a
situation
would
be
in
connivance
with
the
broker,
we
say
that
the
broker
in
such
a
situation
could
be
charged
with
having
accepted
--
having
accepted
money
from
the
seller
on
behalf
of
the
other
side
of
the
transaction.
and
this
is
also
our
reason
for
saying
that
some
of
these
evils
which
have
been
described
here
which
might
be
permissible
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
affirmed,
simply
are
remote
from
the
holding
below,
because
in
such
a
situation
where
the
buyer
coerces
brokerage
fees
from
the
broker,
there
is
no
question,
but
that
there
could
be
liability
under
the
statute
as
it
had
been
construed
over
a
period
of
many
years.
the
departure
comes
in
where
the
commission
says
that
the
broker's
acceptance
of
a
lower
commission
is
in
fact
a
payment
to
him
--
payment
to
the
buyer
by
the
broker.
of
some
significance
also
generally
to
this
case,
we
believe
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
many
years
in
which
the
federal
trade
commission
in
presenting
a
case
to
this
court
involving
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
has
been
joined
by
a
private
group
of
businessmen
and
not
by
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice,
which
is
charged
with
parallel
enforcement
of
the
clayton
act
and
which
customarily
signs
the
commission's
brief,
but
has
declined
to
do
so
in
this
case.
the
petition
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case,
has
an
express
notation
that
the
department
of
justice
in
this
case
is
appearing
merely
as
the
legal
representative
of
the
commission
and
is
expressing
no
views
of
its
own
as
to
the
policy
issues
that
may
be
involved.
we
think
that
it
is
quite
significant,
your
honors,
because
we
have
urged
in
this
case
from
the
outset
that
the
net
effect
and
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
commission's
theory
of
this
case
would
be
to
prevent
the
reduction
of
broker's
commissions
in
competitive
transactions
and
in
effect,
to
freeze
and
stabilize
and
maintain
the
levels
of
broker's
fees
against
competitive
adjustment
in
the
course
of
normal
price
bargaining.
the
justice
department,
in
similar
situations
involving
mechanisms
to
stabilize
brokerage
commissions,
has
consistently
prosecuted
such
conduct
as
an
illegal
restraint
of
trade
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and,
in
effect,
is
prohibiting
and
prosecuting
the
very
type
of
conduct
which
the
net
effect
of
the
commission's
theory
as
urged
here,
before
this
court
would
promote.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
there
was
an
actual
payment
again
of
money
which
there
was
not
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
broker
again
might
be
and
no
court
has
done
so
today,
because
the
case
is
never
arisen
before
a
court,
in
such
a
case,
the
broker
might
be
charged
with
having
taken
money
from
one
side
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
side,
but
once
again
this
was
the
fact
of
this
case.
and
so
far
as
the
policy
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
concerned,
only
last
term,
this
court's
simplicity
pattern
opinion
had
occasion
to
discuss
the
policy
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
as
i
understand
the
discussion
and
analysis
of
the
court
in
that
case,
it
is
that
the
robinson-patman
act
intends
to
foster
and
preserve
open
and
competitive
price
reductions,
because
when
price
reductions
are
open
such
as
they
are
here,
they
can
be
measured
against
cost
economies
which
accrue
from
such
transactions,
so
that
benefit
of
more
economical
processes
may
be
passed
on
from
the
seller
to
the
customer
and
ultimately
to
the
consumer.
in
this
case,
where
there
has
been
much
discussion
about
the
benefits
to
the
small
dealers,
we
think
it
is
highly
significant
that
after
the
main
briefs
in
this
case
were
filed,
the
brookings
institution
published
a
scholarly
survey
and
study
prepared
by
the
federal
trade
commission's
former
chief
economist,
dr.
corwin
d.
edwards,
which
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
commission's
enforcement
of
this
particular
section,
the
so-called,
“brokerage
clause,”
has
in
fact,
been
more
harmful
and
detrimental
to
the
best
interests
of
the
independent
and
smaller
dealer
than
it
has
been
to
the
interest
of
the
chain
stores
against
whom
so
much
has
been
said
here
today
even
though
the
facts
of
the
situation
have
no
remote
relationship
to
chain
stores
and
no
chain
store's
a
respondent
in
this
case
and
the
party
to
the
case
before
this
court.
we
believe
the
sole
beneficiaries
really
of
this
type
of
enforcement
of
the
robinson-patman
act
which
was
never,
never
contemplated
by
congress
so
far
as
we
can
discover,
are
the
organized
food
brokers
whose
--
whose
commission
rates
would
be
insulated
and
protected
by
the
commission's
theory
from
competitive
price
reduction
and
who
have
boasted
about
this
case
and
whose
on
the
presence
we
believe
pervert
--
pervade
the
entire
proceeding
before
the
court.
this
is
the
classic
conflict,
if
your
honors
please,
of
a
strained
interpretation
of
the
robinson-patman
act
by
the
commission
beyond
the
congressional
text
and
beyond
the
congressional
purpose
in
direct
conflict
with
the
principle
of
competition
codified
in
the
sherman
act.
notwithstanding
this
court's
admonitions
to
the
federal
trade
commission
in
the
automatic
canteen
case
to
reconcile
the
robinson-patman
act
with
broader
antitrust
policies
insofar
as
the
text
of
the
statute
permits.
i
don't
believe
i
have
time
to
detail
the
salient
facts
and
to
go
into
the
legal
arguments
as
framed
by
the
commission,
accepted
to
say
that
there
is
no
issue
before
this
court
and
the
facts
of
this
case
of
any
rebate
payment
or
of
any
kickback
payment.
any
discussions
about
the
legal
status
of
rebates
or
kickbacks
or
coercions
by
big
buyers
are
purely
hypothetical
and
have
no
relation
to
the
issue
before
the
court.
what
is
more,
there
is
no
contest
between
us
and
the
federal
trade
commission
on
these
points.
we
have
pointed
out
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
briefs
and
we
have
reiterated
in
our
briefs
before
this
court
that
in
such
situations
as
have
been
painted
by
the
amicus
curiae
for
the
commission
and
by
the
commission
itself,
we
do
not
contest
that
there
may
be
liability,
but
those
are
simply
not
the
facts
at
issue
in
this
case
before
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
thought
that
your
honor
the
case
will
be
continued
if
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
thought
it
was
4:30,
sir.
i
--
i
can
continue
on
to
finish
the
case,
if
i
may.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i'm
--
i'm
very
sorry,
sir,
if
i
gave
that
impression.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes.
the
commission's
theory
of
liability
against
the
respondent
in
this
case
rests
on
two
legal
premises,
both
of
which
we
believe
are
erroneous
and
invalid
and
contrary
to
the
statute.
the
first
premise
by
the
commission
is
that
even
though
this
is
an
open
competitive
price
reduction,
there
is
still
a
so-called
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
here,
which
falls
within
the
text
and
falls
within
the
prohibitions
of
section
2
(c).
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
we
mean,
sir,
that
in
this
transaction
as
reflected
in
the
record
the
price
is
set
forth
in
the
invoices
of
the
parties
and
--
and
open
to
inspection,
so
that
comparisons
maybe
made
by
the
commission
with
alleged
cost
savings,
if
the
occasion
should
arise.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i'm
sorry.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
continued
from
last
thursday,
presents
a
novel
and
unique
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
by
the
federal
trade
commission
of
section
2
(c),
the
so-called
brokerage
clause
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
briefly,
what
we
have
here
was
an
open
and
competitive
price
reduction
by
a
seller
to
a
buyer
coupled
with
the
acceptance
by
a
broker
of
a
lower
rated
commission,
a
price
which
has
the
earmarks
of
legality
under
those
provisions
of
the
statute
relating
to
prices,
the
grant
by
sellers
and
the
receipt
by
buyers.
instead
of
proceeding
or
invoking
the
provisions
of
the
statute
relating
to
prices
by
buyers
and
sellers
under
the
statute,
the
federal
trade
commission
in
this
case
invoked
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
robinson-patman
act
over
two
decades,
the
theory
under
section
2
(c),
the
brokerage
clause,
that
the
broker
in
this
case
by
accepting
a
lower
rate
of
commission
on
this
transaction
was
guilty
of
having
paid
indirectly
a
so-called
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
to
the
buyer.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes,
sir.
this
is
a
unique
situation.
it
was
the
first
complaint
of
this
sort
filed
in
the
history
of
the
statute
where
the
charge
was
that
the
broker's
acceptance
of
a
lower
rate
of
commission
was
tantamount
to
his
having
paid
over
an
indirect
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
to
the
buyer.
the
argument
of
the
commission
to
which
we
addressed
ourselves
on
thursday
was
principally
the
policy
justification
by
the
commission
for
bringing
this
type
of
proceeding
and
for
vindicating
it,
rather
than
the
statutory
basis
and
the
--
the
precedence
which
bear
on
the
problem.
to
summarize
very
briefly,
on
thursday,
we
stated
that
the
position
of
the
commission,
namely,
that
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
here
was
compatible
with
the
policy
of
the
robinson-patman
act
against
discrimination
and
in
favor
of
the
small
merchant.
our
position
was
that
this
was
not
the
fact
in
neither
event
because
the
policy
of
the
robinson-patman
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
quite
recently
in
the
simplicity
pattern
opinion
and
also
previously
in
the
morton
salt
case
was
to
promote
and
foster
open
price
reductions
based
on
cost
economies
for
the
benefit
of
the
customer
and
ultimately
the
consumer.
and
moreover,
that
the
contention
--
that
the
policy
of
this
case
was
in
favor
of
the
small
merchant
was
rather
paradox
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
respondent
here
was
a
small
brokerage
partnership
against
which
the
commission
has
proceeded
rather
than
invoking
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
statute
against
either
the
buyer
or
the
seller.
and
moreover,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
brokerage
institution
survey
and
study
prepared
by
the
federal
trade
commission
chief
economist
after
the
main
briefs
in
this
case
were
filed
and
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
supplemental
brief
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
commission's
application
of
this
particular
provision,
the
so-called
brokerage
clause
has
been
more
prejudicial
and
detrimental
to
the
small
independent
distributor
than
it
has
been
to
the
chain-store
against
which
purportedly
the
commission's
objectives
in
enforcing
this
section
or
directive.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes,
sir.
i
stated
on
thursday
that
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
in
--
in
this
case
had
not
signed
the
brief
of
the
federal
trade
commission
although
it
customarily
does
so
in
cases
involving
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
moreover
that
the
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case,
i
also
pointed
out
that
the
petition
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
carried
a
special
and
--
as
i
consider,
unusual
notation,
at
page
12
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
states,
if
i
may
read
it
quickly,
“that
in
appearing
herein
as
legal
representative
of
the
commission,
the
department
of
justice
intimates
no
views
of
its
own
as
to
the
underlying
policy
consideration
that
maybe
involved,”
that
is
on
page
12
in
the
footnote
of
the
solicitor
general's
petition.
we
deem
as
particularly
significant,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
had
urged
from
the
outset
of
this
proceeding
that
the
net
effect
of
the
commission's
application
of
the
statute
would
be
in
effect
to
prevent
brokerage
commissions
from
being
reduced
in
the
course
of
competitive
price
bargaining
and
we
felt
would
interpolate
into
the
robinson-patman
act
in
effect,
the
principle
of
fair
trade
or
resale
price
maintenance
even
though
there
was
no
such
objective
by
the
congress
and
even
though
similar
arrangements
where
by
in
other
industries
such
as
among
real
estate
brokers
where
brokerage
commission
had
been
stabilized
that
such
mechanism
for
stabilizing
brokerage
commission
had
been
outlawed
as
unlawful
and
unreasonable
restraints
of
trade
in
suits
brought
by
the
antitrust
division
by
the
department
of
justice
and
of
course,
the
case
of
the
real
estate
brokers
was
affirmed
here
by
this
court
in
1950.
in
short,
we
attempted
to
point
out
in
our
argument
on
thursday
that
this
case,
by
virtue
of
its
unprecedented
and
unique
interpretation
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
which
was
not
authorized
by
the
text
and
of
the
cases
as
i
shall
hope
to
develop
in
my
argument
here
also,
produced
a
collision
and
a
conflict
between
the
robinson-patman
act
as
construed
here
by
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
overall
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws
incorporated
in
the
sherman
act
not
withstanding
the
admonitions
by
this
court
to
the
federal
trade
commission
most
recently
in
the
automatic
canteen
case
to
avoid
such
collisions
and
to
reconcile
the
robinson-patman
act
insofar
as
the
text
of
that
statute
permitted
with
a
broader
antitrust
policies
laid
down
by
the
congress
in
the
antitrust
laws
as
a
whole.
before
i
proceed
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that
would
be
my
view
of
the
matter,
mr.
justice
black
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
exclusively.
but
certainly,
as
the
court's
opinion
pointed
out
in
the
automatic
canteen
case
in
resolving
matters
of
statutory
interpretation,
as
i
would
understand
the
solicitor's
footnote,
the
policies
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
a
whole
of
which
the
robinson-patman
act
is
a
part
should
be
taken
into
consideration
so
that
they
should
be
a
harmonious
whole
rather
than
conflicting
parts
which
at
are
at
odds
with
each
other.
before
proceeding
to
the
text
of
the
statute
as
interpreted
in
the
past
two
decades,
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarized
the
salient
facts
which
highlight
what
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
and
perhaps
also
with
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
not.
first,
we
have
here,
and
it
was,
i
believe,
agreed
to
by
mr.
friedman
on
thursday,
an
honest
commercial
transaction.
there
was
no
subterfuge
or
connivance,
but
rather
an
open
price
reduction
by
the
seller
to
the
buyer
in
circumstances
where
there
were
cost
economies
available
to
the
seller
and
in
circumstances
where
the
seller
had
to
meet
competitive
offers
on
pain
of
losing
the
sale
to
the
particular
buyer
here
in
question.
from
the
seller's
viewpoint
therefore,
the
price,
which
he
gave,
had
the
earmarks
of
legality
under
the
basic
provisions
of
the
robinson-patman
act
because
related
to
cost
economies
and
because
related
to
competitive
circumstances.
from
the
buyer's
view
point,
he
merely
asked
for
a
lower
price
because
he
had
equally
low
price
offers
available
from
other
sources.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
or
anywhere
else
of
coercion
or
exaction
or
any
untoward
conduct
on
the
buyer's
part
other
than
his
request
to
receive
a
lower
price
because
he
simply
did
not
want
to
pay
more
to
this
seller
than
he
had
available
to
him
from
other
sellers.
in
the
case
of
the
broker,
the
respondent
here,
his
acquiescence
in
taking
a
lower
rate
of
commission
than
he
originally
had
hoped
to
get
from
the
seller
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
situation
as
he
saw
it
because
first
of
all,
the
seller
put
it
up
to
him
on
a
take
it
or
leave
it
basis
and
so,
unless
he
took
the
reduced
commission,
he
would
have
loss
the
sale
and
secondly,
because
this
transaction
was
of
an
unusual
size
and
dimension
which
saved
him
a
lot
of
long
distance
calls,
as
he
put
it
on
the
record,
and
save
him
a
lot
of
work,
he
in
effect
realized
more
money
for
less
work
from
this
transaction
than
others.
also
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
may,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
and
of
course
that
would
be
the
province
of
the
pricing
provisions
of
the
statute,
section
2
(a)
governing
price
quotations
by
sellers
and
section
2
(f)
governing
the
receipts
of
prices
by
buyers
and
if
in
such
a
situation
this
price
differentiation
could
not
be
justified
either
by
reference
to
cost
economies
or
by
competitive
consideration,
it
might
well
be
held
a
violation,
but
of
course,
in
this
case,
we
did
have
evidence
of
cost
economies
and
competitive
conditions
even
though
the
commission
did
not
proceed
against
the
appropriate
parties
we
feel
to
this
price
differentiation
and
this
evidence
was
rejected
by
the
commission
as
immaterial
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes,
it
did
and
i
would
like
to
state
one
point
merely
to
illuminate
the
record
here.
there
was
no
standard
price
as
such
because
the
price
of
the
apple
contemplated
at
issue
here
had
at
first
been
$1.85
per
gallon
and
had
then
come
down
to
$1.35
per
gallon
and
then
$1.30
per
gallon,
so
it
wasn't
a
commodity
which
had
in
variable
fix
price
but
certainly,
it
is
correct
that
the
seller
in
this
situation
received
less
that
he
expected
to,
at
the
outset,
when
he
authorized
price
quotations
of
$1.30.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
there
was
evidence
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
pointing
to
the
fact
that
he
might
well
have
because
the
seller,
who
is
the
witness
in
this
case,
he
never
had
the
opportunity,
of
course,
to
vindicate
his
price
because
he
was
not
made
a
respondent,
but
he
did
testify
that
in
this
transaction,
he
realized
considerable
economies
from
packaging,
processing,
freight
and
customs
at
the
boarder
in
making
a
transaction
such
as
this.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that
is
exactly
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
believe
the
commission
cannot,
by
a
pleading
device,
convert
an
open
price
reduction
which
is
lawful
under
section
2
(a)
and
to
a
so-called
indirect
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
which
is
illegal
per
se
under
section
2
(c).
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
chief
justice,
in
such
a
situation
where
you
might
say
there
was
actual
connivance
by
the
seller
and
the
broker
to
pass
on
broker's
commission
to
the
buyer
such
as,
we
do
not
have
in
this
case,
there
might
well
be
the
point
made
under
the
statute
that
the
seller
was,
in
fact,
arranging
for
kickbacks
to
the
buyer
and
we
do
not
defend
that
situation
under
the
statute,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the
principle
of
our
case
is
--
as
sweeping
as
to
comprehend
that
particular
situation.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
chief
justice,
the
normal
economic
interest
of
the
broker
as
anyone
else's
including
the
seller
would,
of
course,
be
not
to
give
a
lower
price
because
unless
he
had
to,
he
wouldn't
do
it.
in
a
situation,
where
an
order
to
make
a
sale
in
the
heat
of
the
competitive
contest,
the
broker
had
to
reduce
his
commission
and
the
seller
had
to
reduce
his
price,
it
is
our
position
that
section
2
(c)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
cannot
be
used
to
make
this
competitive
situation,
this
above
board,
non-connivance
transaction,
illegal
per
se
when
there
are
directly
governing
provisions
in
the
statute
which
cover
lower
prices
by
sellers
to
buyers
which
say
a
price
which
is
competitively
justified
and
a
price
which
is
economically
justified,
is
a
lawful
price.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
evidence
in
the
record,
your
honor,
to
the
extent,
it
is
in
the
record,
indicate
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
the
broker
testified
and
the
seller
testified
as
witnesses.
and
as
the
matter
of
fact,
the
broker's
answer
pleaded
that
the
seller's
price
reduction
was
cost
justified
and
competitively
justified.
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
by
the
broker
and
the
seller
that
there
was
cost
justification
insofar
as
they
were
savings
in
packaging,
freight
and
transportation
and
there
was
also
evidence
that
there
were
competitive
offers
available
to
the
buyer
from
other
sources.
in
our
proposed
findings
of
fact
conclusions
of
law,
we
again
put
this
matter
up
to
the
commission,
but
this
was
rejected
by
the
commission
as
immaterial
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
might
concede
and
say
it
is
immaterial
but
i
--
i
would
hesitate
to
do
so,
mr.
justice
harlan,
because
in
view
of
the
facts,
all
the
earmarks
of
the
record
show
that
the
price
would
have
been
lawful
under
section
2
(a).
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
is
immaterial
to
my
position,
yes.
the
commission's
unprecedented,
as
i
said,
and
unique
interpretation
of
2
(c)
for
the
first
time
after
23
years
or
so
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
based
on
two
premises
really,
two
statutory
legal
premises,
one
being
that
where
a
seller
grants
a
lower
price
to
a
buyer
and
at
the
same
time,
that
lower
price
is
coupled
with
a
reduced
commission
by
the
seller's
broker
that
in
such
a
situation,
a
seller
is
granting
a
so-called
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
to
the
buyer
even
though
its
price
be
open
which
is
in
violation
of
section
2
(c),
the
brokerage
clause.
that
is
the
first
premise.
the
second
premise
of
the
commission
is
that
a
broker's
participation
in
such
a
transaction
where
the
seller
gives
an
open
lower
price
and
the
broker
takes
a
smaller
commission
that
the
broker's
participation
constitutes
a
so-called
indirect
payment
by
the
broker
to
the
buyer
of
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage.
the
theory
being
that
by
accepting
a
lower
rate
of
commission,
the
broker
in
effect
gives
the
money
to
the
seller,
who
then
gives
it
to
the
buyer
and
that
is
an
illegal
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage.
now,
as
to
that
first
premise
that
the
seller's
conduct
in
giving
the
lower
price
openly
to
the
buyer
is
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage,
we
believe
that
this
assertion
is
contrary
to
the
basic
premise
of
this
court's
opinion
and
the
simplicity
pattern
case,
only
last
june,
is
contrary
to
a
ruling
by
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals,
only
last
month
in
the
robinson
case
and
is
contrary
to
the
congressional
objective
in
section
2
(c)
as
detailed
fully
and
amply
in
the
legislative
history
which
we
have
included
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
in
the
robinson
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
a
seller
had
first
employed
a
broker
to
find
sales
outlets
for
him
to
a
certain
customer
who
bought
paper
cups.
after
a
while,
the
seller
realized
that
he
would
prefer
to
do
business
directly
with
these
buyers
and
so
he
let
the
broker
go.
after
he
left
the
broker
go,
he
reflected
the
savings
and
the
broker's
commission
in
a
lower
price
to
the
buyer.
thereupon,
the
broker
brought
suit
against
both
the
seller,
in
one
case
and
against
the
buyer,
in
the
other
case,
charging
that
the
seller's
lower
price
which
reflected
the
savings
and
broker's
commissions
was
a
so-called
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
in
violation
of
section
2
(c)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
in
other
words,
precisely,
the
first
premise
of
the
commission's
legal
theory
here,
as
it
has
spelled
it
out
on
page
26
of
its
brief,
page
27
which
says,
“if
a
seller
dispensed
with
his
broker
services
in
making
a
particular
sale
and
then
openly
reduce
to
selling
price
by
the
exact
amount
of
brokerage
involved,
this
would
constitute
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
by
the
seller
to
the
buyer
in
violation
of
section
2
(c).”
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
he
let
him
go
completely.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
there
was
only
one
transaction
in
the
controversy
of
that
case.
i
don't
know
of
course
what
the
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
might
make
a
difference
insofar
as
the
seller
might
or
might
not
be
discriminating
and
insofar
as
the
commission
then
proceeded
against
the
seller,
it
might
certainly
plead
that
there
was
discrimination,
but
insofar
as
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
regardless
of
the
situation
as
between
one
buyer
or
another
buyer
whenever
a
seller
reflects
in
his
lower
price
brokerage
fee
savings,
there
is
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
which
is
the
commission's
position
as
expressed
in
its
brief
here,
then
we
believe
the
robinson
decision
is
directly
to
the
contrary
because
it
says,
as
we
say
that
whenever
there
is
a
lower
price,
such
as
we
have
here,
the
commission
cannot
simply
convert
it
into
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
which
is
illegal
per
se
particularly
when
that
lower
price
is
competitively
motivated,
as
we
have
indicated
in
the
record
here,
and
as
responsive
to
cost
economies
of
the
kind,
which
congress
time
after
time
said
in
the
legislative
history,
it
wished
to
preserve
for
the
consumer
in
the
form
of
lower
prices.
and
as
we
point
it
out
of
course,
also,
the
commission
takes
the
position
here
that
there
cannot
be
a
cost
justification
available
to
the
seller
in
such
a
situation
even
though
congress
expressly,
in
1936,
rejected
the
proposal
that
the
cost
justification
should
not
be
permitted
to
include
economies
and
brokers
commissions.
the
simplicity
patterns
case
which
the
--
which
we
believe
really
spells
out
the
basic
design
of
the
statute
in
the
context
of
which
this
case
occurs,
that
opinion
stressed
and
emphasized
the
fundamental
distinction
in
the
statute
between
the
open
prices,
the
open
prices
which
were
treated
by
congress
as
being
lawful
depending
on
whether
they
were
injurious
to
competition
or
whether
they
could
be
cost
justified
or
whether
they
could
be
justified
by
competitive
responses,
that
was
one
fundamental
premise
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
other
thing
that
congress
provided
for
in
the
statute
was
certain
and
to
use
this
court's
words
false
and
concealed
transactions
which
were
automatically
unlawful
regardless
of
competitive
consequences,
regardless
of
cost
justifications
and
among
those
concealed
transactions,
which
the
court's
opinion
in
the
simplicity
case,
pointed
out
were,
“secret
brokerage
payments”
and
“false
brokerage
payments”.
the
purpose
of
that
distinction
made
by
congress
in
the
robinson-patman
act
and
as
pointed
in
its
legislative
history
also
was
by
making
this
prohibition
on
the
secret
and
concealed
transactions
absolute
and
unqualified
to
thereby
drive
prices
out
into
the
open
with
the
aim,
and
again
to
quote
the
opinion's
language,
“with
the
aim
of
bringing
these
prices
out
into
the
open
so
that
they
could
be
measured
and
so
that
they
could
be
compared
with
possible
cost
economies.”
in
this
situation,
in
the
case
at
bar,
we
have
precisely
such
a
lower
open
price
reduction
forced
out
into
the
open
in
effect
which
could
be
compared
on
the
record
with
cost
economies
available
to
the
seller
and
which
could
be
compared
with
the
competitive
situation
rather
than
being
concealed
--
concealed
transactions
or
rather
than
being
arrived
at
by
any
kind
of
connivance
or
subterfuge
as
the
commission
does
not
contest
in
this
case.
and
nevertheless,
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
this
open
price
transaction
is
an
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage.
we
feel
this
interpretation
is
directly
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
section
2
(c)
of
the
statute
as
expressed
in
the
congressional
reports,
which
we
have
quoted
in
excerpt
in
our
brief.
for
example,
the
report
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee,
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
states
that
the
purpose
of
section
2
(c)
of
the
statute,
the
so-called
brokerage
clause
was
to
bar
“the
practice
of
certain
large
buyers
to
demand
the
allowance
of
brokerage
direct
to
them
upon
their
purchases
or
its
payments
to
an
employee,
agent
or
corporate
subsidiary,
whom
they
set
up
in
the
guise
of
a
broker
and
through
whom
they
demand
that
sales
to
them
be
made.”
and
i
may
say
that
the
legislative
history
repeatedly
and
consistently
reflects
the
tenure
that
secrecy,
connivance,
concealment
and
subterfuge
whether
vices
of
which
the
brokerage
clause
were
directed
because
it
was
an
absolute
prohibition
whereas
the
basic
provision
of
the
statute,
governing
price
dependant
on
competitive
injuries,
competitive
showings
and
permitted
the
justification
of
a
lower
price
by
the
seller
so
that
the
economies
of
efficient
distribution
would
not
be
denied
to
the
customer
and
ultimately
to
the
american
consumer.
as
i
pointed
out,
the
commission's
elimination
of
the
cost
justification
in
an
open
price
situation
of
this
time
is
contrary
to
the
action
of
the
senate
house
conference
committee
which,
in
1936,
deleted
and
struck
out
this
precise
proposal
when
it
was
advanced
by
some
of
the
proponents.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
senator
logan
who
was
the
senate
manager
of
the
legislation
and
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
senate
subcommittee
in
charge
of
the
legislation
pointed
out
that
this
was
one
of
these
fantastic
ideas
by
which
someone
had
tried
to
discredit
the
legislation,
namely,
to
suggest
that
a
seller
could
not
lower
his
price
so
as
to
reflect
cost
economies
predicated
on
brokerage
savings.
the
meaning
and
the
intention
of
congress
in
this
particular
provision
was
illustrated,
we
believe,
quite
clearly
by
the
a
&
p
case
which
was
before
the
courts
in
the
1930s.
this
case,
one
of
the
landmark
applications
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
was
addressed
against
a
&
p
which
previous
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute
had
secured,
coerced
rebates
and
exacted
secret
--
secret
brokerage
commissions
by
the
device
of
setting
up
so-called
field
buying
agents.
a
&
p
set
up
these
field
buying
agents
who
collected
brokers
commissions
from
sellers,
masquerading
as
independent
businessman
and
after
they
had
collected
these
rebates,
they
kicked
them
back
and
passed
them
over
back
to
the
a
&
p
which
thereby
was
able
to
collect
discriminatory
price
favors
which
were
concealed
from
you
and
which
were
hidden
and
could
not
be
detected.
and
it
was
this
type
of
thing
which
congress
was
aiming
against
in
passing
this
provision
shortly
after
the
robinson-patman
act,
the
a
&
p
converted
this
field
buying
deal
whereby
these
field
buying
agents
collected
rebates
and
it
told
these
field
buyers
to
go
out
and
negotiate
with
the
seller
to
convert
the
previous
rebate
payment
and
to
compute
a
false
price
based
on
the
exact
amount
of
the
rebate
and
reflecting
that
amount
of
the
rebate.
and
it
was
this
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
if
there
were
any
defiance,
no,
sir.
it
would
make
a
basic
difference
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
--
if
the
matter
were
done
in
defiance
of
the
act.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
would
be,
but
the
simplicity
pattern
opinion
by
the
court
last
june
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
fundamental
distinction
in
the
statute
between
open
transactions
on
the
one
hand
which
could
be
compared
with
cost
economies
such
as
we
have
here
and
secret
and
false
and
concealed
transactions
which
prevented
the
comparison
of
cost
savings
with
a
lower
price.
we
also
don't
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
was
any
trace
of
defiance
here
because
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
and
we
wouldn't
advocate
it
and
certainly
wouldn't
defend
it.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
1936.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
there
was
no
decision
that
i'm
aware
of
that
led
to
this
particular
proposal,
but
i
think
it
is
a
well-known
fact
and
reflected
throughout
the
legislative
history
that
the
national
association
of
food
brokers
was
a
very
effective
instrumentality
in
the
passage
of
this
legislation
and
their
objective
was
at
that
time
quite
frankly
stated
in
the
hearings
to
prevent
brokerage
commissions
from
getting
squeezed
and
they
wanted
to
preserve
and
maintain
brokerage
commission
at
--
what
thought
reasonable
levels.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
we
have
cited,
mr.
justice
black,
in
our
brief.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes.
we
have
--
we
have
the
--
a
proposal
which
said
that
cost
justification
should
be
permitted
in
economies
other
than
brokerage.
the
words
“other
than
brokerage”
was
subsequently
deleted
because
senator
logan
pointed
out
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
we
have
that
on
page
30
--
31
of
brief.
senator
logan
explained
to
the
senate,
i
have
--
“i
think
perhaps
legitimate
brokerage
ought
to
be
allowed
as
part
of
the
costs,
and
i
think
when
the
bill
was
drafted,
i
did
not
write
the
bill.
perhaps
in
the
amendment
which
was
inserted
by
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
senate
we
had
in
mind
dummy
brokerage,
sham
brokerage.
it
may
be
that
something
should
be
done
about
that.”
and
then
in
the
conference,
this
provision
was
deleted
and
stricken
out.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
brokerage,
mr.
justice
black,
paid
by
a
seller
to
his
agent
rather
than
brokerage
paid
by
the
seller
over
to
the
buyer
or
to
the
false
front
or
dummy
of
the
buyer
because
that
was
device
at
which
congress
was
legislating
and
which
was
prominent
at
that
time.

set
up
a
false
front,
a
dummy
broker
in
the
form
of
a
subsidiary
or
field
buying
agent
and
these
people
collected
broker's
fees
and
kicked
them
back
and
rebated
them
back
to
the
buyer
who
then
collected
a
secret
discrimination
in
that
guise.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no,
sir,
it
only
illuminates
the
problem
but
we
feel
that
this
clear
cut
congressional
intent,
when
read
in
the
light
of
23
years
of
interpretation
where
the
commission
never
even
urged
this
peculiar
theory,
we
suggest
upon
the
courts
or
never
ever
incorporate
this
unique
theory
in
a
complaint
notwithstanding,
i'm
sure,
complaints
by
various
affected
parties
such
as
brokers
who
lost
a
sale
such
as
competing
broker
in
this
case,
lost
a
sale
to
the
respondent
that
nonetheless,
the
commission
never
even
brought
such
a
case
in
23
years
and
moreover,
since
the
theory
which
the
commission's
case
here
incorporates
has
been
rejected
by
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
that
is
a
very
firm
indication
that
the
commission's
premise
of
this
case
is,
we
respectfully
submit,
untenable.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
practical
effect,
mr.
justice
black,
of
the
transaction
here
was
that
a
seller
gave
an
open
price
reduction
to
a
buyer
in
a
situation
where
the
record
indicates,
he
was
meeting
competition
and
where
the
record
indicates
that
he
was
reflecting
cost
economies
in
that
lower
price.
in
other
words,
what
the
seller
did
in
this
case
was
to
implement,
as
i
understand,
the
objectives
of
the
robinson-patman
act
as
set
out
in
this
court's
morton
salt
opinion
and
this
court's
simplicity
pattern
opinion,
namely,
to
foster
open
prices
which
are
cost
justified
for
the
benefit
of
the
consumer,
whom
congress
did
not
wish
deprive
of
the
economies
of
efficient
distribution.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest,
mr.
justice
black,
that
this
--
this
price
was
in
fact
cost
justified
but
that
the
earmarks,
that
the
record
indicates
and
so
far
as
it
indicates
anything
because
the
evidence
was
rejected
as
immaterial,
that
the
evidence
insofar
as
it
is
in
the
record
shows
that
there
were
significant
and
palpable
economies
to
the
seller
in
the
form
freight
savings,
in
the
form
packing
savings
and
in
the
form
of
processing
savings.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
well,
the
commission
rejected
that
as
immaterial
as
mater
of
law.
the
commission
did
not
permit
that
to
affect
its
decision
because
it
said,
“we
did
not
proceed
under
the
pricing
provisions,
we
proceeded
under
brokerage
provisions,
and
when
we
proceed
under
the
brokerage
provisions,
it
is
illegal
per
se
and
all
of
this
evidence
about
cost
savings
and
all
of
these
evidence
about
competitive
response
is
immaterial
as
a
matter
of
law.”
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
there
was
a
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
there
was
a
competitive
price
reduction
by
the
seller
to
the
buyer
of
the
type
which
this
court
has
held
and
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no,
sir.
the
seller
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
--
to
the
buyer.
the
seller
to
the
buyer
of
the
type
which
this
court
has
held
in
interpreting
the
robinson-patman
act
to
be
lawful,
namely,
a
lower
price
where
there
was
--
from
all
the
evidence
we
have
in
the
record,
a
meeting
of
competition
in
good
faith.
if
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
meeting
a
competing
price,
yes,
sir.
because
on
top
of
the
cost
savings,
there
was
even
that
in
the
record
although
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
--
there
were
propose
findings
and
conclusions
submitted
by
us
of
that
effect,
mr.
justice
black,
which
the
commission
rejected
as
immaterial
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
practical
effect
is
one
--
one
customer
for
apple
concentrate.
a
man
named
smucker
in
orrville,
ohio
buying
apple
concentrate
for
5
cents
a
gallon
less
from
a
seller
rather
from
this
seller
then
from
other
seller
who
would
have
given
him
this
lower
price
as
the
record
indicates.
if
i
may
proceed
quickly
to
the
second
premise,
the
derivative
premise
of
the
commission's
theory
here,
namely,
that
a
broker
who
participates
in
an
open
price
reduction
from
a
seller
to
the
buyer
is
guilty
of
paying
a
so-called
indirect
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage
by
accepting
a
lower
commission
via
the
seller's
retention
of
the
balance
by
way
of
the
seller's
lower
price
to
the
buyer
is
guilty
of
a
so-called
indirect
payment
in
section
2
(c)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
first,
i
believe
the
commission
has
recognized
that
the
text
of
section
2
(c)
provides
that
a
person
may
not
pay
a
brokerage
commission
to
the
buyer
or
to
the
buyer's
intermediary.
it
says
“a
person
may
not
pay
to
the
other
party.”
as
i
understood
the
commission's
argument,
it
took
the
position
that
the
broker
was
in
fact
a
party
and
so,
a
payment
by
the
broker
was
a
payment
in
violation
of
section
2
(c),
but
once
again,
it
is
clear
from
the
committee
reports,
which
we
have
excerpted
in
our
brief,
that
congress
was
not
legislating
against
payments
by
brokers,
it
was
rather
legislating
against
payments
by
sellers
to
buyers
and
by
sellers
to
the
false
fronts
and
intermediaries
of
buyers.
the
statutory
prohibition
does
run
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
against
a
broker
receiving
from
the
seller
a
commission
which
he
then
turns
over
or
kicks
back
to
the
buyer.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
and
there
is
no
controversy
between
us
and
the
commissioner
on
that
account,
but
there
simply
is
not
in
section
2
(c)
as
it
is
now
written
a
provision
saying
that
apart
from
this
receipt
of
illegal
brokerage
which
would
make
a
kickback
unlawful,
apart
from
that,
there
is
a
further
prohibition
on
so-called
payments
by
brokers.
and
in
any
event,
the
only
payment
that
there
is
in
this
case
that
there
is
alleged
to
be
in
this
case
is
this
acceptance
by
the
broker
of
a
lower
rate
of
commission.
there
was
no
money
changing
hands.
there
was
no
passing
over
or
rebating
or
kickbacking.
all
the
broker
here
did
was
to
accept
when
the
seller
told
him,
“take
or
leave
it,
3%,”
he
accepted
3%
and
this
is
the
theory
of
indirect
payment.
we
think
it's
very
significant
in
this
connection
that
the
examiner's
initial
decision
for
the
federal
trade
commission
in
this
case,
very
candidly,
we
think,
put
it
that
what
the
commission
was
doing
in
predicating
liability
against
the
broker
here
was
to
filling
a
--
an
omission
what
it
thought
was
an
omission
in
the
text
of
the
statute
as
passed
by
congress.
we
feel
--
and
moreover,
on

yes.
if
there
is
no
kickback
and
if
there
is
merely
the
acceptance
of
a
lower
rate
of
commission,
as
here,
there
is
no
liability
under
section
2
(c)
because
what
we
have
is
an
open
price
reduction
which
congress
specified
in
section
2
(a)
--
2
(a)
and
2
(f)
of
the
statute
to
be
governed
by
this
criteria
whether
it
is
cost
justified
or
whether
it's
competitively
injurious,
whether
it
is
made
to
meet
competition
in
good
faith
because
otherwise,
section
2
(c),
the
limited
provision
governing
brokerage,
would
in
fact
supersede
and
override
the
basic
provision
of
the
statute
governing
price
variations
between
sellers
and
buyers.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no,
sir.
we
do
not
say
that
the
statute
exempts
a
seller's
broker.
we
merely
say
that
since
the
statute
holds
liable,
a
seller's
broker
who
accepts
from
the
seller
a
commission
which
he
kicks
back
to
the
buyer
and
since
the
statutory
text
is
clear
and
since
the
reports
of
congress
documents
point
that
there
is
no
further
special
liability
for
so-called
payments
by
a
broker
and
furthermore,
there
was
no
payment
in
any
conventional
sense
of
that
term
in
the
case
at
bar.
i
would
also,
in
this
connection,
not
neglect
to
point
out
that
senator
logan
once
again,
who
was
the
senate
manager
of
the
bill,
pointed
out
to
the
senate
that
there
was
no
prohibition
in
the
statute
against
deduction
of
legitimate
brokerage.
there
was
nothing
again
--
in
the
statute
against
the
payment
or
deduction
of
legitimate
brokerage.
it
was
rather
sham
brokerage
and
dummy
brokerage
with
which
the
statute
was
concerned.
finally
and
basically,
we
feel
that
the
commission's
theory
of
this
case
of
this
unique
interpretation
of
the
statute,
23
years
after
its
enactment,
has
the
necessary
and
inevitable
effect
of
preventing
the
reduction
of
brokerage
commissions
in
competitive
situations
and
as
a
necessary
consequence,
we
feel,
of
stabilizing
and
maintaining
the
level
of
brokerage
fees
at
unnatural
levels
to
the
detriment
of
the
american
consumer
because
what
the
commission
does
here
in
effect
is
to
foster
the
very
type
of
stabilization
of
commissions
which
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
as
indicated
in
the
real
estate
board
case
has
consistently
pursued
as
unlawful
restrain
of
trade.
we
feel
basically
that
the
antitrust
laws
to
quote
the
classic
phrase
of
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
are
--
“our
charter
of
economic
freedom
comfortable
to
constitutional
provisions.”
for
this
reason,
this
court
has
never
lightly
presumed
departures
and
exemptions
to
the
antitrust
laws.
most
recently
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
mckesson
and
robinson
case
involving
resale
price
maintenance,
a
so-called
principle
of
fair
trade,
this
court's
opinion
pointed
out
that
resale
price
fixing
is
a
privilege
restrictive
of
a
free
economy
and
must
be
narrowly
construed.
we
feel
in
this
particular
situation,
the
danger
to
the
policy
of
antitrust
and
to
the
principle
of
competition
is
graver
because
it
is
more
insidious
in
the
field
of
resale
price
maintenance,
the
clash
between
the
price
fixing
and
the
antitrust
policy
is
manifest,
it
is
open.
what
we
have
here
is
unprecedented
and
we
submit
an
untenable
interpretation
of
the
robinson-patman
act
by
the
federal
trade
commission
which
would
in
fact
stifle
competition
in
the
name
of
protecting
it.
we
feel
that
this
court
should
not
permit
such
a
perversion
of
antitrust.
