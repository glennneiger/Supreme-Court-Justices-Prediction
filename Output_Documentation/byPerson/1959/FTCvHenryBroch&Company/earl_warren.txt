chief

mr.
rowe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rowe,
while
you're
on
the
position
of
the
commission,
thursday,
you
made
some
statement
as
to
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general,
as
i
understood
you,
but
i
--
i
didn't
understand
quite
what
it
was,
would
you
mind
repeating
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
sufficient
that
the
solicitor
general
himself
does
send
an
assistant
here,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rowe,
i
was
wondering
if
a
seller
could
employ
a
--
a
broker
at
a
5%
commission
and
then,
between
them,
they
would
agree
that
in
all
large
sales,
the
--
the
broker
would
only
charge
3%
instead
of
5%
and
pass
that
on
to
the
--
to
the
buyer
because
he
was
not
put
to
so
much
work,
would
that
be
legal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
us
--
let
us
just
say
then
that
there
is
no
agreement
between
the
seller
and
the
broker,
but
broker
as
a
matter
of
his
own
convenience,
wherever
he
gets
a
--
a
large
sale
reduces
his
brokerage
by
2%
or
3%
and
passes
it
on
to
the
--
to
the
buyer
in
order
to
get
the
--
the
business,
would
that
be
a
--
would
that
be
legal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
was
this
lower
--
lower
price
economically
or
competitively
justified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood,
there
was
nothing
to
--
nothing
on
that
issue
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
in
the
robinson
case,
that
--
that
he
dispensed
with
all
services
of
his
broker
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
dealt
--
and
dealt
with
everybody
on
the
same
basis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
make
the
difference,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
the
difference
to,
mr.
rowe,
that
it
was
done
--
instead
of
being
done
secretly,
it
was
done
openly,
but
defiantly
of
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
secrecy
and
so
forth
isn't
terribly
important
to
us
here,
is
it,
if
--
if
it
is
--
if
it
should
be
open
but
defiant
of
the
act,
it
would
still
be
proscribed,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
say
there
was.
i
was
just
testing
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
abstract
more
or
less
but
--
no,
i
don't
do
--
i
don't
suggest
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
would
you
please
comment
first,
mr.
friedman,
on
the
--
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
that
footnote
on
--
on
page
12?
is
that
--
is
that
in
anyway
water
down
the
--
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
or
his
enthusiasm
for
the
case
or
his
belief
in
this
case
or
--
or
just
what
does
it
do?
what
does
it
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
other
thing
that
mr.
rowe
suggested
that
there
might
be
some
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
antitrust
division
does
not
attach
itself
to
this
--
to
your
petition
or
your
briefs,
is
there
any
significance
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
instead
of
5%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
