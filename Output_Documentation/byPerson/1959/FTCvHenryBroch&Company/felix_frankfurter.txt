there's
no
suggestion
that
this
case
is
a
mere
efficient
brokerage
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
any
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
questioning
the
general
proposition.
i
just
want
to
know
if
your
general
proposition
may
slip
this
case
presented.
i
just
want
to
know
if
the
contention
here
is
--
if
this
is
a
blind
of
an
evasive
--
a
factually
evasive
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
commercially
innocent,
prior
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
mean
commercially
it
didn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
that
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
any
of
your
legal
objections
or
indications
you
draw,
but
you
said
same
as
those
of
a
rebate,
but
you
gain
out
of
his
own
--
he's
an
independent
agent.
he's
an
independent
functionary
in
the
--
in
the
industrial
process
and
his
rebates
that
you
call
it
out
of
his
own
pocket,
out
of
his
own
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
any
--
without
any
conspiratorial
or
cooperative
participation
by
the
seller.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
that
--
is
an
insulation
and
he
is
the
conduit
of
the
seller.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
as
end
result.
i
--
i
wonder,
if
i
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
is
the
concrete,
naked
prospect
on
which
legal
conclusion
is
drawn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
may
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
statute
doesn't
serve
your
purpose,
you
go
the
committee
report,
that's
the
end
of
the
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
in
lieu
thereof?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
that,
of
course,
doesn't
say
directly
or
indirectly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
indirectly
has
different
scope
and
connotations
than
in
lieu
thereof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
indirectly,
it
doesn't
hit
this
kind
of
an
arrangement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
introduced
another
factor
when
you
said
the
big
buyer
will
--
will
demand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
actions
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
speaking
of
the
small
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
participations
of
the
buyers,
that
leaves
another
element.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
robinson
case,
mr.
rowe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rowe,
may
i
revert
back
to
this
logan
or
logan
opposed
legislation
in
1936,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
what
decision
or
ruling
or
practice
give
rise
to
the
proposal?
is
there
any
antecedent
enclosed
to
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
often
you've
done
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
often
what
we
ask
to
keep
in
mind
the
policy
of
the
statute
as
construing
it?
are
those
--
is
that
a
--
a
greater
dichotomy
between
the
words
of
the
statute
and
the
policy
it
supposed
to
convey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
how
long
i
should
be
here
but
i
don't
expect
that
statement
to
be
repeated
(inaudible)
it
has
to
construe
a
statute
to
fill
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
doesn't
your
(inaudible)
argued
in
that
exception.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
sir.
we're
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
the
matter
of
law
is
that
like
all
lawyers,
government
lawyers
should
come
in
and
argue
their
cases
with
lawyers
would
read
all
--
all
implications
or
expectations
or
what
(inaudible)
is
good
policy
and
bad
policy.
i
suppose
there
might
be
some
difference
of
opinion
in
mann
act
cases,
(inaudible)
was
saying,
it
doesn't
mean
that
we
subscribe
to
the
policy
of
this
act.
it
quite
might
not.
i
know
many
attorney
generals
who
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
is
it
true
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
the
history
of
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
in
this
kind
of
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
well
aware
that
this
(inaudible)
a
strong
use
of
--
about
the
propriety
of
using
none
action
by
a
commission
that
it
has
some
significance,
i
mean
the
court
has
attached
significance
to
it.
but
i
want
to
know
does
a
situation
as
--
as
unique
as
the
proceeding.
in
other
words,
if
this
kind
of
a
thing
not
happened
so
as
to
bring
into
play
the
commission's
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
give
his
aid
we
can
get
(inaudible)
if
you
give
the
date
we
can
get
it
from
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
if
you
think
of
this
act,
you
wouldn't
describe
this
transaction
as
passing
over,
do
you
--
do
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
phrase
wouldn't
naturally
come
out
to
the
tip
of
your
tongue
of
--
at
the
end
of
your
pen
was
he
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
says
all
right.
but
all
i'm
saying
is
you're
using
--
you're
taking
some
liberties
in
make
it

justice
felix
frankfurter
statutorily
--
legitimately
