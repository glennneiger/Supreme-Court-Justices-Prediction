what
do
you
understand
the
--
the
methods
--
policies
involved
by
the
solicitor
general
here
and
i
would
suppose
that
this
is
--
the
government
tried
to
--
tried
to
follow
whatever
policy
congress
had
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
proposal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
quoted
it,
you
quoted
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
do
you
think
he
meant
by
the
legitimate
brokerage,
brokerage
that
was
actually
charged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
agreeing
with
you
that
--
that
was
what
stimulated
the
(inaudible),
that
doesn't
settle
our
problem,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
practical
effect
of
what
happened
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
you
say
cost
justified?
i
thought
that
was
not
involved
in
this
case
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
can't
quite
understand
if
that
is
the
case
and
that
is
the
issue
that
was
not
tried
out,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
was
no
cost
savings
justified,
what
is
the
practical
result,
what
would
that
get
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
assume
there
was
no
cost
of
justification.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
seller
is
that?
you
mean
the
broker
or
the
other
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
seller.
justice
hugo
l.
black
meeting
a
competing
price?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
findings
to
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
not
either
of
those
findings,
but
suppose
if
they
haven't
been
tested
out,
assuming
that
neither
of
those
things
are
correct,
as
you
say,
what
is
the
practical
result
here,
as
to
these
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
--
is
it
your
--
i
--
i
don't
--
i
want
to
see
if
i
get
clear
in
my
mind.
is
it
your
position
that
wholesaler
or
manufacturer
whatever
it
is,
sells
to
a
broker,
and
that
broker
fixes
here
a
fixed
commission
and
that
broker
cuts
the
commission
and
absent
of
kickback
or
connivance
or
some
kind,
there
can
be
no
liability
under
2
--
under
2
(c)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
then
that
means
that
this
statute
just
doesn't
cover
brokers
first
and
second
that
he
--
he
act
--
the
seller
acting
through
the
broker
is
insulated
unless
there's
some
connivance
between
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
reading
apart
from
another
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
instead
of
page
15
as
cited
on
page
7?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
effect
is,
isn't
it,
that
you
get
your
right,
that
brokers
are
not
allowed
to
compete
with
one
another,
the
law
upon
making
lower
prices.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
the
broker.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
dealing
with
the
sellers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
with
the
seller.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
that
been
officially
reported
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
judge
who?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
he
eventually
and
he
originally
agreed
to
take
5%.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
then
he
sold,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
he
tell
the
manufacturer
why
he
accepted
the
3%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

makes
on
about
what
brokerage
he
was
giving
to
other
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.

was
before
and
after
that?
