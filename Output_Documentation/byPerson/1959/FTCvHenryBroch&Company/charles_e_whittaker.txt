justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
friedman,
i
understand
also
justice
frankfurter
that
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
totally
dependent
that
these
facts
may
lead
you
and
make
yourself
this
far
after
$1.25
that
is
$1.30
if
this
broker
would
reduce
his
commission
from
5%
to
3%.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
don't
think
there
was
any
kickback
now
worth
probably
to
the
canada
company,
or
i
would
say
device
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
but
not
to
its
own.
not
to
present
it
with
the
broker.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
do
you
concede
that
there
is
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
--
not
broch?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
and
if
i
understand
firm,
to
get
down
to
the
--
may
this
broker
give
a
part
from
his
commission
to
his
(inaudible)
and
under
the
--
without
violation
of
the
second,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
you
wouldn't
--
it
would
necessarily
result
into
a
price
to
the
extent
of
this
--
if
you
have
production
such
as
these.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
broker,
not
the
seller?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
assuming
his
broker
is
not
an
agent,
hasn't
been
a
defendant
here.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
and
you
have
used
--
used
whether
this
was
--
the
money
was
passed
over
to
the
buyer
was
why
the
canada
food
or
by
the
broker
that
the
consequence
is
the
same,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
in
fact,
(inaudible)
is
dollars
in
the
buyer's
option,
but
it
would
be
positive
violation
of
law
would
it
not,
for
the
seller
to
make
a
reduction
to
this
particular
buyer
and
does
not
sell
to
him
on
substantially
equal
time.
but
would
it
be,
if
this
--
the
broker
out
of
his
own
goodness
of
heart
may
give
--
paid
his
own
money
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
over
to
the
buyer.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
could
this
at
my
point
have
a
half
the
whole
price
is
there's
none?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
to
proceed
without
letting
both
the
parties
in
this
transaction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
broker
(inaudible)
this
and
you
said
the
broker
in
making
the
sale
in
this
canada
foods
and
the
market?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
not
because
of
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
what
he
makes
the
rate
is
(inaudible)
adjusted
from
sale
to
sale.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
he
use
the
word,
discrimination?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
you
said
an
open
discrimination,
does
he
use
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
just
like
mr.
broch.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you,
i
don't
know
whether
this
should
enlighten
or
is
not
but
it's
running
through
my
mind
and
i'm
somewhat
confused
about
it.
what
if
a
broker
or
a
seller
waives
or
reduces
his
commission
in
some
sales
to
some
purchasers,
but
not
to
others?
does
that
result
in
the
--
and
it's
passed
along,
we'll
say,
the
saving
by
the
seller
to
the
customer?
is
that
result
in
the
seller
selling
on
less
than
substantially
equal
terms
to
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
this
very
case,
the
canada
foods
company,
the
seller
by
re
--
did
on
--
in
accepting
this
25-cent
price
even
though
there
was
reduction
in
the
broker's
commission
from
5%
to
3%
actually
receive
less
than
it
would
have,
had
it
sold
it
at
the
standard
price
of
30
cents
a
gallon
and
paid
a
5%
commission,
isn't
that
right?
it
actually
received
less
for
the
goods.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
he
could
not
justify
the
whole
reduction,
cost
justify?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
you're
explaining
the
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
orders
over
a
certain
price,
the
commission
(inaudible)
would
that
be
offered?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)

charles
