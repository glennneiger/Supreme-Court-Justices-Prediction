against
canada
it
must've
mean
you
have
it
drawn
two
ways?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
discrimination
to
be
subject
to
(inaudible)
absence
and
what
go
to
that
section
which
you
don't
buy
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
broker
has
asked
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
doubt
that
mr.
broch
can
make
his
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
could've
and
you
say
that
because
that
would
be
a
pure
price
discrimination
in
your
view,
unless,
it
was
justified
under
the
2
(a)
defenses
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
as
sort
of
a
conduit
type?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
he
gave
--
the
seller
gave
this
customer
a
price
reduction.
there's
no
doubt
about
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
price
discrimination
and
the
question
under
2
(a)
would
have
been
whether
it
was
a
justifiable
price
discrimination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
say
that
because
the
--
of
the
presence
who
have
broker
here
and
the
transaction
between
the
seller
and
the
broker
that
economically,
that
price
discrimination
was
made
feasible
or
easier
for
the
seller
that
that
brings
the
transaction
under
2
(c).
justice
john
m.
harlan
we'll
have
to
do
some
reading
in
the
act.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
those
defenses
available
under
2
(f)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
fact,
the
situation
(inaudible)
the
effort
of
the
seller's
brokerage
pays
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
the
first
complaint,
you
say,
that's
been
filed
of
this
character?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
point
is
that
this
has
to
be
tested
under
2
(a)
and
does
not
become
a
per
se
violation
in
effect
under
2
(c)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
putting
your
position,
in
other
way
if
i
understand
it,
you
could
concede
arguendo
that
this
violated
two-way,
you
don't
--
in
other
words,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
it's
immaterial,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
but
you
could
--
i
didn't
mean
to
--
naturally
you
don't
concede
anyway
--
anything
away,
but
it's
immaterial
to
your
position
here
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
effect
of
this
was
under
2
(a)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
a
difference
between
the
antitrust
division's
view
on
the
antitrust
laws
and
federal
trade
commission's
(inaudible)?
