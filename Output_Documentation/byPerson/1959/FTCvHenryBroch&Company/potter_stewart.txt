before,
well
--
that
--
that's
just
as
you're
right
here
and
i
--
on
these
facts
would
the
--
would
the
buyer,
smucker
be
guilty
of
violation
of
2
(c)?
justice
potter
stewart
against
--
against
buyers.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
brokers.
justice
potter
stewart
the
buyers
--
did
the
buyers'
conduct
here
be
covered
by
the
literal
language
of
the
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
the
literal
language
was
a
flattering
language,
i'm
not
sure.
justice
potter
stewart
the
purpose
is
like,
what's
behind
my
question
to
this?
you
--
you
in
your
argument
stated
in
your
brief,
and
rely
very
heavily
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
saying
that
the
particular
--
particular
evils
calling
the
attention
of
congress
are
not
the
relevant
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
literally
covers
the
situation
and
my
question
was
whether
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
didn't
also
cover
the
buyer?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
is
the
price
that
in
this
case,
the
buyer
was
smucker
or
some
name
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
--
a
manufacturer.
justice
potter
stewart
manufacturer
of
what,
apple
butter
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rowe,
if
i
may,
you
said
that
the
conduct
here
has
no
relationship
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
do
you
mean
by
that
to
say
that
it
is
not
covered
at
all
by
the
literal
language
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
accepting
for
a
moment
the
finding
of
the
commission,
i
understood
--
i
understand
that
they
found
that
what
in
fact
happened
here
was
that
the
broker,
the
respondent,
your
client,
passed
along
part
of
his
brokerage.
now,
accepting
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
that
finding,
if
there
was
one,
would
that
constitute
a
violation
of
the
literal
words
of
the
--
on
section
2
(c)
or
wouldn't
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
making
analysis
by
it,
that's
a
better
word.
