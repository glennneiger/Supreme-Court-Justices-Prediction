justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
bergson,
could
i
ask
you
please.
would
assume
just
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
concrete
answer
here,
affirmance
of
the
court's
holding
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
entirely
support
this
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
when
--
wouldn't
the
judgment
be
supported
entirely
by
section
7
of
the
clayton
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now,
that
--
is
that
not
a
borden
situation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
it
wasn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
let
me
ask
you,
if
we
add
to
that
then,
the
second
count
under
section
3
of
the
sherman
act,
would
that
count
plus
the
one
under
7
of
the
clayton
act,
fully
support
this
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
when
would
that
be
a
--
would
that
be
a
borden
situation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
that
were
true,
then
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
us
to
pass
on
the
government's
appeal
here,
would
it,
because
the
result
would
be
the
same?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
from
section
3,
now.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose
you
could
go
on
to
finance
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
by
these
terms,
i'd
have
you
to
say
that
if
you
are
not
exempt,
these
transactions
you've
just
related
would
violate
section
3
--
section
3
of
the
sherman
act
and
7
of
the
clayton
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
you
were
not
exempt.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
--
would
they
also
violate
section
2
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
judge
holtzoff
held
here
--
held
the
other
way
on
--
on
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
violation
of
section
7.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
that
the
broad
--
contact
with
an
outsider
could
mean
--
could
mean
our
positions
in
government
on
section
3
of
the
sherman
act
to
say
you've
bought
embassy
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
consensus
and
you
paid
too
much
money
for
it,
all
for
the
purposes
of
monopolizing
commerce.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
--
didn't
judge
holtzoff
find
for
the
government
or
the
constitution?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
if
you
have
entitled
here
under
that
circumstance
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
the
price
is
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
the
price
is
right
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
the
price
is
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
elman
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
nothing
and
you
have
to
(inaudible)
that
requirement
was
--
all
that
the
affirmance
of
count
1
or
any
of
the
sections
worst
than
that.
well,
that
presumes
a
question
of
law
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
however,
if
what
you
was
view
on
that.
that
was
making
decisions,
have
to
go
back
to
(inaudible)
would
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
my
question
would
put
a
stop
to
this,
maybe
passed
on
that.
suppose
these
people,
you
want
to
represent
(inaudible)
officially,
do
they
not
have
to
support
your
judgments?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
question
that
i
ask
you,
if
i
may,
mr.
elman,
are
you
dissatisfied
then
with
the
relief
given
you
by
the
court
as
respect
to
counts
2
and
3
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
standing
alone?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
just
wanted
to
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
frankly,
the
only
one
i
see
is
your
claim
of
a
right
to
visitation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
about
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
elman
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
elman
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
to
--
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
the
case
must
go
back
in
any
event.you
therefore,
treated
as
one
case,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
how
many
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
separate
judgments
or
separate
counts
treated
in
one
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
other?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
74?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then,
that's
treated
as
being
separate
suits,
aren't
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
there
could
only
be
one
final
judgment
in
the
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
but
it's
three
causes
of
action.
it's
three
separate
causes
of
action
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
under
one
complaint.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
this?
suppose
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
in
which
you
gave
mr.
justice
--
mr.
learned
--
judge
learned
hand
as
a
quotation
from
him
saying
this
condition
would
be
monstrous
if
it
were
true,
but
we
do
not
know
whether
it's
true
until
there
has
been
a
trial,
now,
my
question
does
that
mean
that
you
concede
that
the,
in
effect,
sustaining
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
count
1
was
that
the
cause
of
action
is
stated
and
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
took
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
to
plead
in
existence
of
learning
the
truth
which
you
referred
to
it
in
the
complaint.
but
that
as
judge
learned
hand
pointed
out
in
the
case
you
referred
to,
it
would
be
monstrous
if
it
were
sold
but
it
can't
be
told
what
it
is
until
there's
been
a
trial.
but
here,
the
complaint
has
been
dismissed.
now,
there'd
be
no
opportunity
to
try
it.
you
must,
here,
now
confess
the
facts
alleged,
that
is,
that
are
well
pleaded.
now,
is
there
a
cause
of
action
stated?
