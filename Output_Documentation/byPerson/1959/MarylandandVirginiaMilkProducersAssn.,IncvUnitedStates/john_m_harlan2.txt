justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
now
a
difference
--
it
makes
no
difference
(inaudible)
having
she
used
--
i
haven't
read
--
of
reading
the
government's
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
they're
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
--
and
make
this
concrete.
that
means
i
take
it,
in
your
view,
if
an
agricultural
association
starts
a
campaign
to
drive
people
who
have
not
joined
it,
out
of
the
market.
you
say
they
could
not
be
reached
of
the
antitrust?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
--
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
what
you
call
your
second
--
the
second
situation
which
you
say
that
the
associates
to
this
kind
could
be
prosecuted?
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
an
outsider
for
the
benefit
of
an
outsider
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
what
you
mean
by
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
outsider
concept
that
you're
emphasizing
here
is
something
you'll
find
in
the
legislative
history
or
something
that
you
deduce
in
the
borden
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
it
was
important
to
view
your
legal
position
for
30
years.
you're
going
to
be
able
to
present
as
to
--
the
facts
of
the
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
with
the
situation
before
where
we
--
before
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
scope
of
exemption
tendered
to
recognize
under
the
clayton
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
the
bank
do?
is
it
simply
a
commercial
transaction
--
looks
at
it
from
a
credit
standpoint
or
what
does
it
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
question?
supposing
you
had
nothing
in
this
case
other
than
the
fact
that
this
association
was
100%
--
included
100%
of
the
producers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
nothing
else,
could
you
maintain
this
action?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
the
fact
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
fact
--
the
fact
of
a
monopoly
as
such,
just
the
bare
monopoly
arising
from
voluntary
--
voluntary
aggregation
of
100%
of
the
producers,
doesn't
get
you
anything.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
my
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
except
the
monopoly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
went
no
further
than
that.
that
was
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
to
this
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
these
particulars
that
you've
been
pointing
out
all
relate
to
the
monopoly
charge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
entirely.
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
you've
got
your
relief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
is
this.
you
--
you
say
that
--
you
said
yes
in
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question,
that
you
were
--
you
considered
the
monopoly
charge
very
important
from
the
standpoint
of
your
position
on
the
relief.
therefore,
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
--
we
sustained
you
on
the
monopoly
charge,
in
other
words,
the
exception
is
not
applied
and
that
you're
entitled
to
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
these
allegations,
i
should
think
the
question
of
relief,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
it
depended
upon
your
proving
the
particulars
that
concerned
the
monopoly
charge
is
distinguished
from
the
counts
on
which
you've
won
would
have
to
wait
the
trial
of
these
issues.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
all
of
this
is
subject
to
proof
that
what
you've
alleged
here
is
the
fact.
it
hasn't
been
proved.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
monopoly
power,
as
such,
is
something
that's
immunized,
as
you
agreed
this
morning
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
it's
voluntary,
but
do
you
said
all
this
stuff
shows
that
this
goes
beyond
the
voluntary
characteristics,
therefore,
you
ought
to
have
more
relief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i'm
suggesting
that
these
allegations,
so
far,
are
nothing
but
allegations
and
they
haven't
been
tried
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
then
you
don't
reach
the
question
of
extending
relief
until
you
do
try
them
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
it
depended
on
another?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
then
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
misread
your
brief.
i
thought
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
addressed
is
professionally.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
elman,
if
you
just,
one
question,
and
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
time,
but
to
declare
my
--
my
own
--
i
think,
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
the
question.
assuming
that
you
don't
prevail
on
your
appeal
and
the
case
is
left
where
it
now
is,
as
far
as
the
merits
are
concerned.
you
said
you
didn't
ask
us
to
write
a
decree
at
this
stage.
in
that
hypothesis,
would
you
ask
us
to
broaden
the
relief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright,
i
understand
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
varies
as
to
what
its
underscoring
is,
isn't
it?
