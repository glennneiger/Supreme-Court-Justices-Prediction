mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
if
your
honor
please.
as
house
council
for
this
unhappy
group
of
farmers,
let
me
suggest
that
the
important
reality
in
the
situation,
to
my
mind,
is
this.
the
government
concedes
that
we
have
a
right
to
get
100%
of
these
producers
into
an
organization.
they
admit
that,
since
1923,
we
have
had
from
85%
to
95%
of
the
milk
production
in
this
area.
now,
having
all
this
milk,
on
the
income,
the
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
in
on
the
outcome?
we've
got
to
sell
it.
in
other
words,
if
we
don't
sell
it,
we're
simply
a
savings
bank
for
milk
or
a
warehouse.
now,
in
selling
it,
we've
got
to
sell
it
from
a
monopoly
position.
in
other
words,
we
are
a
monopoly
all
this
time
and,
so,
we
are
selling
this
milk
from
a
monopoly
position.
we
are
committing
acts
of
monopoly,
all
along
the
line,
in
selling
this
milk.
we're
bound
to
restraint
trade.
we're
bound
to
fixed
prices.
we're
bound
on
most
occasions,
i
suppose,
or
some
occasions,
to
exclude
producers.
so,
everything
we
do
has
two
sides
to
it.
in
other
words,
in
the
operation
of
this
monopoly,
we
are
doing
acts
together
under
section
1.
we
are,
likewise
making,
from
out
viewpoint,
the
necessary
contracts
and
agreements
to
effectuate
the
sale
of
our
members'
milk.
but,
unquestionably,
we're
violating
the
antitrust
laws
if
we're
to
be
judged
by
ordinary
antitrust
standards.
now,
what
is
the
test?
the
test
--
the
only
test
that
we
can
see
is
undue
enhancement
of
prices.
unless
that's
the
test,
the
antitrust
division
can
bring
a
lawsuit
or
indict
us
any
day
in
the
week.
i
don't
know
why
they
pick
out
the
embassy
acquisition.
they
could
just
as
well
have
gone
back
to
1923
and
indicted
us
and
sued
us
and
enjoined
us
for
everything
we
did
over
that
whole
period
of
time
because
we
were
operating
a
monopoly.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
well,
i
thank
your
honor
for
that
--
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
--
frankly
question.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
my
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
had
to
put
it
tr
--
its
trust
somewhere.
it's
just
like
the
situation
that
judge
learned
hand
had
before
him
in
new
york
in
gregoire
against
biddle,
a
suit
against
attorney
general
biddle
for
alleged
vicious
practices
against
somebody
in
an
immigration
proceeding.
judge
learned
hand
said
it
would
be
monstrous
to
deny
this
man
relief
if
he
was
right,
but
we
can't
tell
if
he's
right
until
the
case
is
tried.
now,
in
the
same
situation
here,
you
never
can
tell
if
the
antitrust
division
is
going
to
assail
all
these
acts
all
along
the
line,
going
back,
as
i
say,
to
1923,
until
after
the
case
is
tried.
and,
that's
precisely
what
congress,
i
think,
by
the
overwhelming
legislative
history
which
we've
cited
to
you,
was
anxious
to
avoid
because
it
knew
the
antitrust
division,
having
competitive
cheap
prices
as
its
object,
would
naturally
assail
any
of
our
activities,
over
the
period
of
years,
and
an
operation
of
a
monopoly
which
was
designed
not
to
get
prices
down
but
to
get
prices
up.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
up
but
fair.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
am
saying
that.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
am
saying
that,
your
honor,
and
that
that
was
the
only
place
it
could
put
it
and
it
could
only
give
the
undue
enhancement
of
prices
as
the
test
because
anything
else
we
did
would
naturally
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
now,
if
the
department
of
justice,
the
antitrust
division,
could
assail
our
activities
any
day
in
the
week
for
any
routine
act
that
we
committed
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws,
they
could
restrain
those
acts
all
along
the
line.
there'd
never
be
any
opportunity
for
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
reach
the
question
of
undue
enhancement
of
prices.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
in
the
event
he
finds
undue
enhancement
of
prices
--
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
--
your
honor
--
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
he
can
do
anything.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
he
does.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
the
only
test
is
the
undue
enhancement
of
prices.
in
other
words,
if
those
acts
don't
result
in
the
undue
enhancement
of
prices,
why,
they're
down
in
my
maps
way
in
jury,
you
put
it
that
way.
in
other
words,
congress
intended
to
regulate
the
agricultural
economy
by
allowing
cooperatives
to
raise
prices
and,
in
that
process,
somebody
is
bound
to
get
injured.
you
can't
help
it.
now,
to
put
their
trust
somewhere
and
i
say
they
put
it
in
us.
and
evidently,
it's
been
well
placed
because
it's
been
a
long
time
since
the
capper-volstead
act
was
passed.
now,
take
the
embassy
acquisition.
there
you
have
a
perfect
example.
there
we
had
a
chance
to
move
seven
or
--
20,000
gallons
of
milk
a
day
from
class
3
into
class
1,
double
it,
$750,000
a
year
to
us,
greatly
valuable
thing.
it
kept
prices
up
and
stabilized
the
market.
yet,
it
had
a
reverse
side
of
the
coin,
namely,
that
it
displaced
these
producers
out
here
in
maryland.
naturally,
if
we
were
going
to
put
our
producers
in,
the
maryland
producers,
the
other
producers
wouldn't
go
out.
but,
we
couldn't
help
it.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
no.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
that.
i
say,
though,
that
there's
no
way
for
a
cooperative
to
operate
by
going
down
to
the
department
of
justice
everyday
in
a
week,
hand
in
hand,
to
get
clearance
for
its
everyday
act,
all
of
which
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
your
honor,
what
judge
learned
hand
said
was
that
public
policy
prevents
even
an
attempt
to
add
at
trial,
the
reason
being
that
you
can't
harass
public
officials
by
suits
good,
better,
or
indifferent.
and
that's
my
point
here.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
we
can't
be
harassed
by
governmental
suits
good,
bad,
or
indifferent,
everyday
in
the
week.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
don't
know
how
to
follow
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
well,
there
isn't
any
public
official,
your
honor,
but
we
are
public
functionary
in
the
sense
that
we
are
the
method
or
means
by
which
congress
has
chosen
to
regulate
the
agricultural
economy.
and
incidentally,
in
that
respect,
when
mr.
elman
was
asked
as
to
whether
the
bank
for
cooperatives
simply
said,
“we
were
good
credit
risks”,
at
page
11
of
our
bli
--
brief,
we've
pointed
out
very
clearly
that
the
bank
for
cooperatives
made
the
statutory
findings.
and,
the
statutory
findings
were
that
the
loan
was
in
aid
of
the
agricultural
policies
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
section
--
it
says
that
the
findings
were
that
the
agricultural
market
act
require
the
loan
to
be
in
furtherance
of
policy
declared
in
1141,
namely,
promoting
the
establishment
and
financing
of
a
farm
marketing
system
of
producer-owned
and
producer-controlled
cooperative
associations.
and
by
aiding
in
preventing,
and
i'm
not
going
to
read
all
the
words
but
this
is
the
point,
and
preventing
depressions
in
prices
for
the
commodity.
so,
our
point
is
that,
in
this
case,
the
government
is
applying
competitive
ideas
to
a
branch
of
the
economy
where
competitive
ideas
have
no
place.
certainly
we
restrain
trade.
certainly,
we
eliminate
competition.
as
i
say,
we
do
it
and
we
do
it
simply
because
congress
has
said,
not
only
you
can
do
it
but
that's
the
way
to
do
it.
that's
the
way
you
keep
prices
up.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
all
the
antitrust
laws
are
(inaudible)
in
the
american
tobacco
case,
of
course,
the
standard
oil
case,
and
other
cases,
all
the
antitrust
laws
have
been
designed
to
prevent
enhancement
of
prices
and
are
detrimental
to
the
public.
now,
here
--
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
but
the
boycott
--
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
--
was
on
route
to
the
enhancement
of
prices.
now,
here,
you
have
a
congressional
policy
that
prices
ought
to
be
enhanced
and,
so
to
me,
it's
completely
illogical
to
apply
to
that
policy,
as
given
in
the
second
section
of
the
capper-volstead
act,
ideas
which
are
drawn
from
just
the
opposite
policy,
namely,
to
keep
prices
down.
mr.
william
j.
hughes,
jr.
they
might
be
common
law
torts,
your
honor,
but
i'd
say
that
so
far
as
the
congressional
policy
of
getting
farmers
a
fair
return
for
their
money
and
they
never
will,
unless
they
get
together,
prices
will
drop
down,
down,
down
of
it.
that
it
isn't
any
violation
of
that
policy.
somebody,
as
i
say,
gets
hurt
on
route
and
ever
--
bound
to
be
people
that
are
hurt
in
the
thing.
now,
i
think,
therefore,
the
task
of
this
court,
as
i
might
--
if
i
might
suggest
it
is,
in
accordance
with
its
decision
in
the
hutcheson
case,
there,
you
drew
together
the
various
congressional
policies
and
you
came
up
with
a
solution
to
the
labor
problem
of
that
day.
now,
we
say
the
same
thing
applies
here.
here,
you
have
various
agricultural
statutes,
all
of
which,
in
the
end,
point
to
a
regulation
of
agriculture,
by
a
way,
completely
divorced,
as
i
think,
from
the
antitrust
laws.
thank
you,
your
honor.
