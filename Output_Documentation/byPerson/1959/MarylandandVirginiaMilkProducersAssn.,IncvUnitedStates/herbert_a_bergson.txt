mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
by
both
parties
from
judgments
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
this
is
a
case
that
was
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
charging
violations
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
section
3
of
the
sherman
act,
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
court
below
held
that
agricultural
cooperatives,
which
the
defendant
established
it
was,
are
exempt
from
prosecution
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
were
not
acting
in
combination
with
outsiders
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
6
of
the
clayton
act
and
sections
1
and
2
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
the
government
is
appealing
from
this
decision,
in
this
judgment.
the
court
also
held
that
the
cooperative
was
not
exempt
when
it
acquires
a
retail
dairy,
where
the
effect
of
the
acquisition
is
to
restrain
trade
in
violation
of
section
3
of
the
sherman
act
or
to
substantially
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
from
this
judgment,
the
association
appeals.
the
government
also
appeals
from
this
judgment
on
the
issue
of
adequacy
of
the
relief
that
was
granted
by
the
district
court.
the
issue
that
is
central
to
both
appeals
is
not
whether,
but
to
the
extent
--
but
the
extent
to
which
agricultural
cooperatives
are
exempt
from
the
normal
operations
of
the
antitrust
laws
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
the
clayton
and
capper-volstead
act.
now,
there's
no
dispute
between
the
parties
that
there
is
some
exemptions.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
some
exemptions.
the
government
in
its
main
brief
concedes
that
agricultural
cooperatives
were
given
a
limited
immunity
from
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
namely,
the
right
to
obtain
a
monopoly
in
the
colloquial
sense
and
i'm
quoting,
“of
controlling
the
entire
source
of
supply
in
a
particular
area.”
the
government
also
concedes
that
the
act
from
this,
an
agricultural
association
to
obtain
a
degree
of
control
over
supply,
which
in
the
case
of
ordinary
corporations,
might
constitute
unlawful
monopolization.
further,
in
its
reply
brief,
the
government
states
that
it
has
not
asserted
that
a
cooperative
by
the
mere
possession
of
monopoly
market
power
transcends
any
capper-volstead
authorization.
the
government's
position,
as
stated
in
its
question
presented,
is
whether
monopolization
or
attempted
monopolization
by
coercive
and
exclusionary
means
are
immunized.
it's
the
association's
position,
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
cooperative
has
complete
immunization
from
antitrust
prosecution,
say
it
in
two
circumstances.
one,
where
it
combines
with
nonexempt
--
combines
or
conspires
with
nonexempt
outsiders
for
the
benefit
of
the
nonexempt
outsiders
as
was
the
case
in
borden,
and
two,
where
the
monopolization
results
in
undue
enhancement
of
prices.
in
that
case,
a
special
procedure
is
set
up
whereby
the
secretary
of
agriculture
makes
findings
of
fact,
considers
the
question
of
monopolization
and
undue
enhancement
and
authorizes
and
--
and
orders
the
association
to
desist
from
such
monopolization
or
restraint
of
trade.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
it's
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
your
honor,
our
first
brief
at
pages
3
(a)
--
no,
excuse
me
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
4
(a).
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
capper-volstead.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
and
we
--
we're
both
talking
about
the
same
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
statutes
and
i
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that
--
that
was
the
only
procedure
where
they
act
alone
as
any
event
of
going
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
to
enhancement
of
prices.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
and
that
is
through
the
procedures
set
up
in
the
--
in
the
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
it
does
not,
your
honor.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
explicit
exemption
from
the
sherman
act
either
for
the
position
that
we
take
or
for
the
position
that
the
government
takes.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
two
potentially
conflicting
statutes
which
is
resolved,
i
think,
by
a
--
a
--
clearly
resolved
by
the
legislative
history
and
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
that
--
that's
the
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
congress
intended
to
take
agriculture
out
of
the
courts.
that
the
--
that
congress
made
it
clear,
the
antitrust
laws
were
not
to
be
applicable
to
agriculture
or
to
farmer's
cooperative
when
they
associate
in
--
under
the
provisions
of
the
capper-volstead
act,
unless
they
unduly
enhance
prices.
and
then,
they
proceed
before
the
department
of
agriculture.
and
if
the
department
of
agriculture
finds
that
there
is
undue
enhancement
of
prices,
then
the
secretary's
order
is
referred
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
can
bring
original
proceedings
in
the
district
court
at
which
time
he
can
seek
all
sorts
of
equitable
relief
against
the
violators.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
but
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
only
--
only
in
the
event
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture's
order
is
not
complied
with.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
--
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
makes
that
quite
clear.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
quite
right.
quite
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
they
--
i
think
that
the
history
of
congressional
enactment
--
enactments
going
back
to
the
19th
century
shows
that.
i
think
that
this
court
recognized
that
in
--
in
tigner
against
texas,
where
it
said
that
the
--
there
was
a
--
a
special
congressional
policy
towards
agriculture.
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
evil
at
which
the
sherman
act
was
directed,
were
the
evils
resulting
from
big
business
and
not
from
an
agrarian
situation.
and
the
--
the
act
--
the
--
the
legislative
history,
as
i
think
i
can
demonstrate,
showed
that
congress
consider
all
these
problems.
and
they
resolved
the
problem
the
same
way
the
sherman
act
was
resolved,
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
because
as
justice
--
as
--
as
judge
hand
said
in
the
aluminum
case,
that
when
they
enacted
the
sherman
act,
they
could
not
determine
which
were
bad
trusts
and
which
were
good
trusts,
so
they
forbade
all
trusts.
so
too,
when
they
were
enacting
these
agricultural
statutes,
they
couldn't
determine
which
were
bad
and
which
were
good
and
they
permitted
all.
say
that
on
the
once
or
in
the
two
circumstances,
where
there
was
unduly
enhancement
of
prices
or
where
there
was
combination
with
outsiders.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
--
yes,
it
would
because
the
judgment
against
the
association
is
based
solely
on
the
--
on
the
--
well
not
solely,
it's
under
section
3
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
think
it
would
be.
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
sir.
because
the
capper-volstead
act
permits
the
association
to
make
contracts
with
outsiders,
the
association
cannot
live
in
a
cocoon.
it
has
to
deal
with
outsiders.
in
the
borden
case,
your
honor,
you
had
a
conspiracy
between
the
association
and
outsiders
where
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
benefit
the
outsiders
and
the
--
and
--
and
the
association
was
a
participant
in
the
conspiracy.
now,
in
the
section
7
situation,
you
have
a
single
transaction
of
sale,
an
acquisition
of
a
dairy.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
that
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case,
your
honor,
to
indicate
that
this
acquisition
took
place
for
the
benefit
of
anyone
but
the
association.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
i
think
i
--
i
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
your
honor,
because
the
facts
don't
--
the
facts
don't
substantiate
the
borden
type
charge
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
i
should
speak
for
the
government,
but
i'm
quite
confident,
the
government
would
say
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
you
to
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
pass
on
their
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
on
their
appeal.
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
section
2
count,
the
count
charging
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
the
government
charges
the
association
with
monopolizing
and
attempting
to
monopolize
the
trade
in
milk
in
the
district
of
columbia
market.
and
they
charged
various
means
of
attempting
to
monopolize.
in
their
original
complaint,
they
charged
merely
that.
they
have
now
shifted
their
position
so
that
the
charge
is
monopolization
or
attempt
to
monopolize
by
coercive
or
predatory
practices
because
they
now
conceive
that
irrespective
of
the
language
of
the
--
the
language
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
which
contains
no
language
of
exemption
whatsoever,
that
capper-volstead,
at
least,
permits
the
--
an
association
to
have
a
--
a
supply
control
position
and
a
monopoly
position
in
the
supply
of
milk.
then
they
go
on
to
say
that
you
cannot
use
that
supply
control
position
and
cannot
maintain
that
supply
control
position
by
engaging
in
practices
which
they
assert
are
predatory.
now,
what
is
a
predatory
practice?
what
is
a
coercive
practice?
if
you
can
have
a
monopoly,
which
they
admit,
and
you
refuse
to
deal
with
somebody,
that's
a
coercive
practice.
that's
a
predatory
practice,
but
does
that
mean
that
the
--
that
a
person
with
a
monopoly
can't
--
can't
do
--
can't
refuse
to
do
business
with
someone
when
they
are
--
when
--
when
the
monopoly
is
authorized,
even
--
even
if
the
person
whom
--
whom
they
refused
to
sell,
refuses
to
pay
the
price
asked
by
the
association
and
which
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
not
said
is
unduly
enhanced.
we
--
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
it's
impossible
to
draw
a
line
here.
that
you
can't
say
that
something
is
coercive
or
predatory
and
therefore,
it
is
not
immunized,
and
at
something
else
which
is
a
monopoly,
which
they
concede
that
an
association
can
have
in
which
a
business
corporation
can't
have
is
not
immunized,
because
they
put
the
catchphrase
or
the
antitrust
cliché,
predatory
or
coercive
against
it.
and
i
--
and
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
--
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
capper-volstead
act
is
so
overwhelming
on
these
point
that
--
that
it
--
it
defy
--
it
defies
contradiction.
i
think
the
best
way
to
--
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
is
--
is
not
to
say
--
not
even
to
refer
to
what
was
said
when
the
act
was
being
passed,
but
just
what
was
done.
when
the
bill
was
introduced
in
the
house
in
the
66th
congress,
it
was
--
it
was
introduced
in
substantially
the
same
form
as
it
now
stands,
some
modification
which
i
will
get
to
later.
and
it
passed
the
house
in
that
form
and
all
of
the
--
well,
i
will
get
--
when
it
went
to
the
senate,
an
amendment
was
proposed
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
and
the
senate
judiciary
committee
proposed
that
instead
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
section
2,
that
the
federal
trade
commission
be
substituted.
and
also
that
an
antimonopoly
amendment
be
added
to
section
2
and
that
amended
--
and
that
amendment
reads
as
follows,
“nothing
contained
herein
shall
be
deemed
to
authorize
the
creation
of
or
attempt
to
create
a
monopoly
or
to
exempt
any
association
organized
herein
under
from
any
proceeding
instituted
under
the
act
entitle,
an
act
to
supplement
existing
law
against
unlawful
restraints
and
monopolies
and
for
other
services
approved
on
october
15,
1914
on
account
of
unfair
methods
of
competition
in
commerce.”
that
or
those
two
amendments
were
adopted
by
the
senate
in
the
66th
congress.
and
the
house
refused
to
go
along,
so
the
bill
came
up
again
in
the
67th
congress.
and
it
was
reintroduced
in
substantially
the
same
form
that
it
had
been
introduced
by
congressman
volstead
who
was
chairman
of
judiciary
committee
in
the
66th
congress.
there
was
one
change.
and
he
left
out
a
provision,
any
law
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
and
i
will
touch
upon
that
later.
the
bill
passed.
the
senate
reported
the
bill
out
again
and
yet
omitted
present
section
2,
but
it
put
the
walsh
antimonopoly
in
them,
with
which
i
just
read
to
you
in
the
bill
as
an
amendment
to
section
1.
and
there
was
very,
very
vigorous
debate
in
the
senate
on
whether
or
not
the
walsh
antimonopoly
amendment
should
be
adopted.
and
it
was
overwhelmingly
defeated
by
a
vote
of
56
to
5.
the
bill
then
returned
to
the
house
and
it
became
law.
but
the
debates
--
and
there,
i
submit
is
--
is
proof
conclusive
that
the
senate
and
the
house
were
both
aware
of
the
monopoly
problems
here.
and
they
deliberately
and
overwhelmingly
defeated
a
provision
saying
that
monopolies
were
to
be
prohibited
under
this
act.
but
if
you
go
to
the
debates
in
this
congress
and
you
find
out
why
this
bill
was
introduced,
why
this
--
why
was
this
legislation
needed?
why
did
--
why
did
the
farmers
think
they
needed
a
legislation
of
this
kind?
and
of
it,
the
debate
show
conclusively
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
that
get
the
farmers
out
of
the
courts.
but
the
--
the
clayton
act,
section
6
had
been
passed
which
as
your
honors
will
recall,
is
the
provision
which
exempts
the
labor
organizations
and
cooperatives
from
the
operation
--
from
--
from
the
--
their
existence
from
the
operation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
after
that
act
was
passed,
prosecutions
against
farmer
cooperatives
continued.
there
was
the
king
case
in
massachusetts
where
the
farmers
were
indicted
for
refusing
to
sell
potatoes
to
people
who
wouldn't
pay
the
right
price
for
it,
the
price
that
they
fixed.
they
were
indicted
for
it.
no,
there
were
no
claims
that
there
was
any
undue
enhancement.
they
were
just
boycotting
the
purchases
of
potatoes,
a
predatory
practice
under
the
government's
definition.
but
because
of
cases
like
that,
the
farmers
asked
congress
for
additional
protection
and
the
debates
are
replete
with
statements
that
the
purpose
of
the
capper-volstead
act
was
to
keep
the
farmers
out
of
court.
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
if
a
break
was
needed
so
far
as
farmers
were
concerned,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
was
the
man
to
supervise
their
conduct.
of
course,
the
debates
made
clear
that
the
--
that
the
farmers
were
not
to
be
immunized
from
the
antitrust
laws
when
they
conspired
with
outsiders
for
the
benefit
of
the
outsiders,
but
where
the
farmer
acted
alone,
he
couldn't
monopolize.
and
it's
a
congressman
ethics
--
there
was
never
any
dispute
during
the
course
of
the
debates
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
legislation.
the
dispute
was
just
to
the
desirability
of
it.
everybody
recognized
that
this
legislation
would
exempt
farmers
from
the
antitrust
laws,
except
in
the
two
cases
or
the
two
instances
that
i
mentioned.
and
the
opponents
of
the
bill
were
against
it,
because
they
didn't
think
that
the
--
the
farmers
should
be
immunized
from
the
antitrust
laws.
and
senator
king,
when
the
debates
were
--
when
the
--
when
the
bill
was
being
debated
in
the
senate
said
that
--
as
--
as
the
proponents
of
the
legislation,
if
they
realized
that
if
this
legislation
was
passed
without
the
so-called
walsh
amendment,
which
i
referred
to,
that
this
could
result
in
monopolies
so
oppressive
and
so
gigantic
that
if
--
that
no
one
would
want
to
approve
of
it.
and
the
senate,
in
the
face
of
those
statements,
rejected
the
walsh
antimonopoly
amendment
by
an
overwhelming
margin.
we
have
in
our
brief,
digested
the
legislative
history.
we
have
gone
to
considerable
length
in
trying
to
make
it
--
i
digest,
just
as
fair
as
possible.
it
would
be
a
waste
of
the
court's
time
at
this
time
to
try
to
cover
these
debates,
but
i
think
the
--
the
conclusion
is
--
is
inescapable.
that
congress
knew
exactly
what
it
was
doing,
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
keep
the
farmers
out
of
court,
and
that
if
the
government's
prosecution
in
this
case
is
upheld,
the
will
of
congress
will
be
defeated.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
that
--
well
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
right,
the
borden
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
the
borden
situation.
for
example
in
the
borden
case,
there
was
a
conspiracy
between
or
a
combination,
call
it
what
you
will,
in
which
the
--
an
--
an
association
was
a
party,
all
of
the
distributors
in
the
market
were
a
party.
a
labor
union
was
a
party.
the
health
officials
of
the
city
of
chicago
were
named
as
defendants.
and
what
was
charged
was
a
massive
conspiracy
to
raise
the
price
of
milk
to
the
consumer
for
the
benefit
of
the
distributor
of
the
milk,
not
the
cooperative
and
the
cooperative
participating
in
that
--
in
that
conspiracy.
now,
this
limitation
on
borden
has
--
i
--
i
submit,
there's
nothing
that
we've
--
isn't
something
that
we've
dreamed
of,
because
all
through
the
borden
opinion,
the
reference
is
to
conspiracy
or
conduct
with
outsiders.
in
the
allen
bradley
case,
where
the
unions
were
held
to
be
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
because
they
were
part
of
a
conspiracy
for
the
mutual
benefit
of
the
--
of
the
union
and
for
the
manufacturers
in
the
district,
this
court,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
black,
says
that
if
--
they
emphasized
in
citing
borden,
italicized
the
words,
“acting
together
with
outsiders,”
in
its
opinion
and
suggested
that
if
the
union
were
doing
this
for
itself
alone
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
outsiders
that
the
union
would
be
exempt.
and
following
that
suggestion
in
(inaudible)
that
was
decided
the
same
day,
where
it
is
found
that
the
union
was
not
acting
for
the
benefit
of
an
outsider
even
though
the
union
--
the
act
of
the
union
put
the
plaintiff
trucking
company,
out
of
business.
and
even
though
the
act
of
the
union
put
the
employees
of
the
plaintiff
trucking
company,
who
wanted
to
join
the
union,
out
of
business
because
they
wouldn't
let
them
join
them
--
the
union.
this
court
said,
“this
is
not
a
cause
of
action
that
is
cognizable
under
the
antitrust
laws.
this
maybe
a
tort
of
some
other
kind,
but
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
applicable
here.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
borden
was
--
was
an
outsider.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
that
here,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
--
i
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
i
think
it
is
important
that
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
outsider.
and
--
and
i
think
the
reason
for
it
is
demonstrated
by
--
by
the
facts
in
this
case
which
after
a
long
time,
i
haven't
[laughs]
gotten
to
yet.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
investigation
was
triggered
by
the
association's
acquisition
of
embassy
dairy.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
and
that
was
what
was
held
to
be
unlawful,
the
acquisition
of
embassy
dairy.
in
the
original
complaint,
in
the
charge
for
a
violation
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
the
acquisition
of
embassy
dairy
was
particularized
as
a
means
of
unlawful
monopolization.
that
was
held
by
the
court
below
to
be
lawful.
then
they
charged
that
the
acquisition
of
embassy
dairy
was
a
contract
in
restraint
of
trade
and
therefore,
in
violation
of
section
3
of
the
sherman
act.
they
also
charged
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
that
that
has
dropped
out
of
the
picture
between
the
district
court
and
here.
they
further
charged
the
acquisition
of
embassy
dairy
as
a
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
that
it
substantially
lessened
competition
to
intend
to
decree
a
monopoly.
subsequently,
they
amended
the
complaint
insofar
as
the
section
3
charge
is
concerned.
and
they
said
that
instead
of
being
a
contract
in
restraint
of
trade,
the
embassy
acquisition
became
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade.
in
fact,
beginning
in
april,
1954
which
was
about
a
month
before
we
acquired
embassy,
we
conspired
with
certain
people
in
--
to
--
to
restrain
trade
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
people
with
whom
we
are
alleged
to
have
conspired
are
the
contracting
parties.
at
the
trial,
the
government
adduced
no
evidence
that
the
transaction
of
sale
was
for
the
benefit
of
--
for
the
competitive
benefit
of
the
seller.
and
the
court
made
no
such
finding.
the
court
didn't
find
that
a
contract
combination
or
conspiracy
--
he
founded
a
transaction
of
sale.
now,
i
think
i
should
say
this,
that
we
don't
contend
that
if
the
antitrust
laws
are
applicable
to
the
association,
that
these
acts
do
not
violate
section
3
or
section
7.
we
are
not
urging
as
a
factual
matter
that
this
--
this
contract
of
acquisition
doesn't
restrain
trade
or
it
doesn't
substantially
lessen
competition.
our
primary
and
i
would
say
our
sole
defense
is
that
congress
said
that
when
an
association
not
acting
in
concert
with
others
for
the
benefit
of
the
others,
is
not
to
be
hold
in
a
court
by
the
attorney
general
to
determine
whether
its
act
of
monopolization
illicit
or
elicit,
even
though
under
ordinary
antitrust
statutes,
no
acts
of
monopolization
elicit.
and
let
the
courts
determine
on
the
complaint
of
the
attorney
general
whether
a
particular
transaction
is
a
lawful
act
of
monopoly
or
an
unlawful
act
of
monopoly.
that
the
congress
said,
“we'll
take
our
chances
here.”
the
agrarian
economy,
the
--
the
agricultural
economy
is
different
from
the
--
from
the
industrial
economy.
and
the
antitrust
laws
aren't
suited
to
the
--
the
--
to
the
--
to
the
industry
--
to
the
agricultural
economy.
so
we
will
put
these
farmers,
unless
they
conspire
with
outsiders,
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
the
man
who
knows
them
best.
and
if
they
unduly
enhance
prices,
he
can
crack
down
on
it.
and
if
they
don't
--
if
they
don't
comply
with
the
--
with
the
order
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
then
let
the
attorney
general
come
in
and
then
let
the
attorney
general
bring
the
action.
and
the
attorney
general
commented
that
time,
bring
his
action
against
restraint
or
trade,
monopolization
or
anything
that
he
wants
to
bring
into
this.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no.
i
--
it's
--
it's
both,
your
honor.
they
--
we
find
it
in
the
legislative
history
and
i
submit
that
you
--
that,
your
honor,
that
the
government
hasn't
indicated
anything
to
the
contrary.
and
further
than
that,
so
far
as
the
outsider
concept
is
concerned,
i
think
the
government
--
even
the
government
has
abandoned
that
because
they
have
made
the
test
in
their
briefs,
not
whether
the
transaction
of
acquisition
of
embassy
restrains
trade,
but
whether
it
was
a
necessary
contract
for
the
association.
in
the
question
of
contact
with
an
outsider
or
--
or
acting
alone,
but
is
this
a
necessary
contract?
now,
you
can't
read
their
briefs
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
they
conceive
that
if
a
contract
is
for
the
financial
benefit
of
the
association,
even
though
it
may
restrain
trade,
that
they
cannot
proceed,
but
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
completely
--
if
you
adopted
the
test
to
that
kind,
you
would
completely
frustrate
the
intention
of
congress
because
you're
putting
the
cooperative
right
back
in
the
courts
again.
is
the
contract
necessary
or
isn't
it
necessary?
and
i
think
again,
the
fact
in
this
case
illustrates
the
--
the
impropriety
of
doing
that.
one
of
the
things
that
--
one
of
the
things
that
the
government
alleges
here
or
asserts
here
is
that
we
acquired
embassy
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
competition,
the
competition
of
a
supplier
in
the
market
who
bought
from
people
who
were
not
members
of
the
association.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
right,
under
section
3.
that
we
--
that
we
foreclosed
these
other
suppliers
from
the
market
as
a
result
for
this
acquisition,
that
we
wanted
to
get
a
competitive
thorn
out
of
our
side,
because
embassy
dairy
was
a
price
cutter
in
the
market.
and
further
than
that,
we
paid
an
exorbitant
price
for
embassy.
and
they
rely
most
heavily
on
the
fact
that
we
paid
them
an
--
an
exorbitant
price
for
embassy.
and
that
we
paid
some
million
or
$1.5
million
more
than
the
physical
assets
were
worth.
and
we
did.
we
paid
$1
million
for
a
noncompete
provision,
which
is
a
normal
ancillary
provision
in
the
sale
of
a
business,
for
a
tenure
noncompete
in
the
washington
metropolitan
area,
no
corresponding
noncompete
on
our
side.
but
--
and
the
government
says
that
as
a
result
of
the
operation
of
embassy
dairy,
we've
lost
money.
and
they
adduced
evidence
at
the
trial
from
an
fbi
accountant
--
accountant
showing
that
in
the
retail
distribution
phase
of
the
embassy
business,
the
association
lost
x
numbers
of
dollars.
they
completely
overlooked,
they
completely
ignore
the
fact
that
the
association
is
an
integrated
operation.
that
as
an
integrated
operation,
it
made
millions
of
dollars
as
a
result
of
the
embassy
transaction,
because
it
put
surplus
milk
from
manufactured
use
where
they
were
getting
about
$3
a
hundredweight,
into
the
class
i
usage,
where
they
were
getting
$6.62
a
hundredweight.
and
that
the
overall
operation
was
in
fact
of
financial
benefit
to
the
association.
now,
they
make
much
of
the
point
that
we
wanted
to
get
a
price
cutter
out
of
the
market.
yet,
this
is
what
all
of
the
agricultural
acts,
over
the
past
30
years,
have
looked
to.
what
the
department
of
agriculture
has
recommended
time
and
time
again,
cooperative
associations
and
which
were
the
factors
that
were
relied
upon
by
the
department
of
agriculture
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
embassy
transaction
when
they
recommended
to
the
baltimore
bank
for
cooperatives,
which
is
an
agency
of
the
federal
government
to
lend
us
$2,100,000,
so
that
we
could
buy
embassy
dairy.
and
this
--
this
acquisition
for
which
we
are
being
prosecuted
under
the
antitrust
laws
was
consummated
with
government
funds.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
i
think
they
could
be
charged
--
they
could
be
charged
as
a
means
of
violating
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
it
was
charged
as
a
means
of
violating
section
2.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
on
that.
that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
judge
--
the
--
the
peculiar
circumstance
here
is
this,
that
judge
holtzoff
held
that
we
could
monopolize
under
--
under
the
clayton
act
and
the
capper-volstead
act
and
that
there
were
no
strings
on
our
monopolization,
so
long
as
we
didn't
act
with
an
outsider.
then
he
finds
that
the
acquisition
of
embassy
dairy
is
a
tendency
to
monopoly
or
may
substantially
lessen
competition
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
in
violation
of
section
7.
now,
how
can
you
have
the
power
to
monopolize
and
be
guilty
of
tendency
to
monopolize?
now,
i
submit
that
this
course
of
reasoning
was
that
we've
--
had
lost
our
exemption,
because
we
had
contact
with
an
outsider
and
then
--
and
each
ordinary
antitrust
standards
were
applicable.
our
position
is
that
we
don't
lose
our
--
our
exemption
when
we
have
contact
with
an
outsider
because
if
we
had
--
if
we
lost
our
exemption
when
we
had
contact
with
an
outsider,
we
could
never
sell
milk.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
he
did,
but
he
found
for
the
government
on
their
account
because
we
had
lost
on
--
he
--
under
his
theory,
we
had
lost
our
immunity.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
all
right.
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
at
which
--
at
which
embassy
would
resell
milk?
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
we
think
we
can,
yes.
and
that's
charged
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
yes.
the
--
the
act
specifically
provides
that
cooperatives
may
have
marketing
agents
in
common.
and
if
they're
going
to
have
marketing
agents
in
common,
they
certainly
can
agree
among
the
--
on
the
price
themselves.
and
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
is
charged
as
one
of
the
alleged
means
of
unlawful
monopolization
in
the
part
that
judge
holtzoff
held
was
exempt,
because
there
was
an
allegation
that
we
can
--
conspired
with
the
or
combined
with
the
baltimore
cooperative
to
fix
the
price
of
milk
for
sale
to
government
installation
--
to
the
government
installation
at
fort
meade.
of
course,
the
charge
was
that
we
fixed
it
too
low,
but
not
that
we
unduly
enhanced
price,
but
that
we
fixed
the
--
an
--
an
unusually
low
price
for
the
sale
of
the
government
installation.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
were
charged
with
monopolizing
and
as
a
means
of
monopolization
was
this
agreement
with
another
cooperative.
judge
holtzoff's
position
was
you
don't
loose
your
immunity
because
your
other
--
the
other
--
other
cooperative
is
not
an
outsider.
it's
another
cooperative.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
the
--
the
--
there
isn't
any
--
any
sort
of
an
agreement
that
we
--
embassy
was
an
outsider,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
we
couldn't,
because
we
weren't
the
same
line
of
business.
embassy
--
embassy
is
a
--
a
distributor
of
milk.
if
the
--
our
cooperative
up
until
the
time
it
acquired
embassy
dairy
was
a
supplier
of
milk
to
distributors.
now,
if
we
made
an
agreement
with
embassy
and
fixed
the
price
at
which
embassy
would
resell
its
milk,
well
that's
the
borden
situation.
but
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
the
government
--
the
government
doesn't
contend
that
the
--
the
--
that
a
cooperative
has
no
right
to
acquire
dairy
and
the
capper-volstead
act
specifically
provides
that
you
can
acquire
--
i
mean
that
--
that
cooperatives
can
get
--
can
--
can
engage
in
the
collective
marketing,
supplying,
processing,
manufacturing,
distribution
and
so
forth.
and
during
the
debates,
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
particularly
important.
during
the
debates
on
the
walsh
amendment,
one
of
the
horrible
examples
of
senator
walsh's
paraded
before
the
senate
was
this.
“suppose,”
he
says,
“that
all
of
the
milk
producers
in
the
washington
area
both
from
virginia
and
maryland
get
together
and
form
a
cooperative
and
exclude
others
from
their
cooperative
and
then
refused
to
sell
to
distributors.
and
as
a
result,
take
over
the
distribution
of
milk
so
that
they
have
the
marketing
of
milk
from
the
cow
to
the
consumer
themselves
and
thereby
eliminate
all
of
the
distributors
of
milk,
a
more
predatory
practice
or
--
i
can
think
of
--
is
that
if
you
adopt
the
house
version
of
this
bill,
that's
what
you
will
permit.
and
my
amendment
is
designed
to
prevent
just
that.
and
his
amendment
was
defeated,
56
to
5.
and
he
had
another
amendment
which
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
questioned
the
you
--
you
were
asked,
mr.
justice
harlan,
bring
it
to
mind.
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
effects
of
this
embassy
acquisition
was
that
the
suppliers
to
embassy
was
their
outlet
and
they
were
farmers.
they
had
three
things
--
they
--
they
could
do
three
things.
they
could
join
the
association.
they
could
go
off
the
market
or
they
could
sell
to
other
distributors
in
this
market.
and
what
happened
was
that
some
40
of
them
joined
this,
they're
120
altogether.
some
40
of
them
joined
the
association,
some
44
of
them
sold
to
other
distributors
in
the
market
who
bought
partially
from
the
association.
and
the
remainder
went
to
baltimore
and
served
the
baltimore
market.
they
were
maryland
producers
and
they
served
--
served
the
baltimore
market.
but
during
the
course
of
the
debates
on
this
bill,
senator
walsh
introduced
another
amendment.
he
said,
“what
if
these
associations
get
big
enough
and
they
have
all
they
need
and
they
decide
that
they
won't
let
anybody
else
join
the
association,
what's
to
happen
to
these
nonmember
producers?”
and
he
introduced
an
amendment
requiring
the
associations
to
admit
in
the
membership,
anybody
who
wanted
to
join.
and
that
amendment
was
defeated
and
it
was
defeated
in
spite
and
in
the
face
of
language
that
some
producers
may
not
be
able
to
continue
to
market
their
milk
because
of
the
size
of
the
association.
congress'
intention,
we
submit,
was
to
do
the
best
they
could
to
provide
an
equitable
procedure
against
undue
enhancement
of
prices
to
get
the
cooperatives
out
of
court,
to
keep
them
from
being
prosecuted
for
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws,
say,
where
they
combined
with
the
outsiders.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
[laughs]
well
i
--
i
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
think
--
i
think
i
have
to
--
to
a
limited
extent,
your
honor.
the
--
the
facts
so
far
as
the
--
the
government
appeal
is
--
is
concerned
or
that
they
charged
a
violation
of
section
2
that
we
have
unlawfully
monopolized.
and
they
charged
that
we
ended
into
--
get
all
sorts
of
things
in
other
to
achieve
that
monopoly.
we
fixed
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
prices.
we
engaged
in
what
they
termed,
predatory
practices.
we
--
there's
--
there's
no
need
to
detail
and
i
think
some
of
them
could
--
could
well
be
classified
as
predatory
practices.
and
judge
holtzoff
held
that
capper-volstead
and
section
6
of
the
clayton
immunized
the
association
from
the
prosecution.
so
far
as
the
embassy
acquisition
is
concerned,
these
are
the
facts.
in
9
--
in
april
of
1954,
there
was
a
tremendous
surplus
of
milk
in
the
district
of
columbia
market.
the
association
was
trying
to
move
its
surplus
milk
in
the
so-called
class
1
classification.
i
think
there's
no
need
to
go
into
the
classified
use
plan
because
i
think
this
court
is
abundantly
familiar
with
it.
they
went
to
embassy
dairy
and
they
asked
embassy
to
buy
from
the
association.
embassy
--
the
president
of
embassy
said
to
them
that
he
would
not
buy
from
the
association.
and
the
secretary
of
the
association
said,
“well,
i
guess
that
leaves
us
no
alternative,
but
to
apply
for
a
federal
marketing
order.”
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
a
federal
marketing
order
under
the
agricultural
marketing
act,
not
the
agreement's
act.
the
owner
of
embassy
dairy
said
to
--
look,
why
do
that?
why
don't
you
buy
me
out?
he
said,
“i'm
--i
have
a
milk
business
in
baltimore.
my
health
isn't
of
the
best
and
if
the
price
is
right,
i'll
sell
to
you.”
and
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
yes,
if
it's
an
adequate
price
for
--
for
the
--
for
the
sale.
and
he
fixed
the
price
which
the
association
accepted
it.
now
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
the
price
was
right.
the
reason
that
the
association
was
interested
in
the
acquisition
was
to
have
an
outlet
for
16,000
or
18,000
gallons
of
milk
a
day
that
was
presently
going
--
going
into
manufacture
usage.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
sir.
they
were
independent
farmers
and
embassy
bought
some
milk
from
outside
the
area.
from
--
well,
i
don't
know
--
as
far
away
as
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
the
embassy
was
strictly
a
distributor.
and
it
had
producers,
120
producers,
d.c.
inspected
producers
who
supplied
its
milk.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no.
at
the
time
--
the
time
of
the
merger,
the
coop
was
only
a
producer.
it
only
became
a
distributor
as
a
result
of
the
merger.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
it
was
not
in
the
distribution
business
before.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
this
was
a
vertical
acquisition
and
not
a
horizontal
acquisition,
so
far
as
we
were
concerned.
it
had
--
the
government
contends
vertical
effect
and
that
it
foreclosed
independent
producers
from
supplying
embassy
dairy.
and
therefore,
had
a
restraining
effect
on
the
independent
producers
who
were
supplying
embassy
dairy.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
we
offered
membership
to
all
of
them.
40
of
them
did
become
members.
44
of
them
served
other
distributors
in
this
market.
and
the
other
30
elected
to
go
to
baltimore
and
continue
to
supply
the
owner
of
embassy
--
old
owner
of
embassy
dairy.
the
--
at
--
at
the
time
that
this
purchase
was
under
consideration,
the
officers
of
the
cooperative
went
to
the
department
of
agriculture
and
said,
“we
are
contemplating
purchasing
embassy
dairy.
and
this
is
why
we
want
to
purchase
it.
we
want
to
get
as
much
milk
as
we
can
under
class
i
classification.
in
addition
to
that,
embassy's
activities
in
this
market
is
having
an
effect
on
our
lend
price,
because
of
their
price
cutting
activities.
and
we
would
like
to
eliminate
that
threat
to
our
pricing
structure,
which
would
be
--
i
--
i
can
see
that
this
would
be
a
--
a
complete
violation
under
the
--
under
--
if
there
were
no
immunity.
in
analyzing
this
proposed
acquisition,
the
farmers
cooperative
service
of
the
department
of
agriculture
in
looking
at
the
benefits
that
would
accrue
from
this
acquisition
said
that
among
the
benefits,
would
be
the
elimination
of
price
cutting
and
the
possible
increase
of
the
blend
price
as
a
result
thereof.
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
were
--
the
association
would
be
able
to
move
more
milk
from
class
i
into
the
class
iii
into
the
class
i
price.
and
they
recommended
to
the
baltimore
bank
for
cooperatives
that
the
baltimore
bank
for
cooperatives
make
a
loan
to
this
association
so
that
it
could
acquire
embassy
dairy.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
there's
a
letter
from
the
farmers
cooperative
service
to
the
department
of
--
to
that
--
the
baltimore
bank
for
cooperatives
which
is
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
sir.
i
--
well,
we
have
--
we
have
two
points
on
that,
mr.
justice
clark.
one
is
that
so
far
as
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
is
concerned
that
there's
a
series
of
events
which
result
in
this
acquisition
of
embassy
dairy
being
consummated
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
therefore,
immunized.
but
in
addition
to
that,
our
--
our
position
is
that
this
transaction
is
immunized
anyway
because
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
it's
711
of
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
it's
--
it's
page
711
of
the
record,
i
think
your
honors.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
your
honor,
i
--
just
did
--
reminded
that
i
have
used
up
all
my
--
almost
all
my
time
and
we
would
like
to
save
a
little
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
for
rebuttal.
thank
you,
sir.
