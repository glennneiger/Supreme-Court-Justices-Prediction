you

turning

turning
to
the
page
where
one
could
put
his
eyes
on
the
terms
of
the
statute
instead
of
the
rephrasing
it?
justice

it
comes
from
capper-volstead,
isn't
it?
justice

be
it
that,
it
doesn't
stay
explicitly

it
doesn't
--
it's
lifted
out
of
the
sherman
law
in
terms
of

justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
that's
the
issue.
justice

what
you're
saying
is
that
a
filthy
difference
issue
for

isn't

(voice

--
justice

well,
except
--
except
that
maybe
--
it
is
in
section
2
and
bound
up
with
a
different
procedure
than
it
would
be
under
the
sherman
law.

nobody

(voice

--

no.
what
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
the
limitation
which
you
recognize,
which
the
chief
justice
could
deal.
you
said
that's
in
the
capper-volstead
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
price
limitation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i
suggest
that
the
price
limitation
there
is
somewhat
different
from
what
the
price
limitation
arguably
is
under
the
sherman
law
because
of
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
different
procedures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
provided
my
comment
isn't
addressed
or
dealt
with
the
validity
of
the
argument.
addressed
to
tell
to
your
suggestion
that
the
price
limitation
isn't
really
--
is
taking
care
of
rises
under
capper-volstead
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you've
now
said,
it
seems
to
me
indicate,
it
doesn't
arise
under
the
capper-volstead
act,
it
deals
with
a
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
i
misunderstand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
limit
you're
dealing
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
--
can
--
but
--
all
right.
then
--
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
prices
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
what
section
2
does,
if
you
have
no
other
ingredient,
mere
price
combination
is
not
subject
to
what
otherwise
it
would
be
subject
to
under
the
sherman
law.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
that
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
what
it
is
in
connection
with
reading
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
have
a
right
to
--
to
vouch
the
borden
case,
where
the
postulate
was
laid
down,
namely
that
the
immunities,
the
implied
immunities
that
they're
not
expressed,
that
the
capper-volstead
act
derived
from
section
1.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
starting
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
starting
point
of
borden
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
further
say
that
that
whatever
power
he
had
under
section
2
of
capper-volstead
to
approve
must
be
exercised
explicitly
as
an
approval
and
it
can't
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
the
bank
which
loaned
him
money
to
make
this
transaction
possible
was
using
government
funds?
do
you
reject
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting
that
the
banks,
if
using
government
funds,
entirely
means
a
proof.
the
banks
disavowed
of
approval
couldn't
change
that
legal
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
quite
properly,
financial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suggesting
there's
an
implicit
legal
problem
issue
that
the
mere
use
of
government
funds
does
not
constitute
an
approval.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
monopoly
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
capper-volstead
did
in
the
charter
of
association.
justice
felix
frankfurter
legislative
charter
of
association
and
the
statute
doesn't
put
any
limit
as
to
how
many
can
belong
to
this
voluntary
association.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
be
clumped
into
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
elman,
may
i
ask
whether
the
maryland
and
virginia
milk
producers
association
had
the
equivalent,
if
it
were
a
corporation,
well,
it
is
a
corporation,
articles
of
incorporation
setting
forth
its
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
in
the
record?
is
that
in
the
record?
well
--
i'll
go
to
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
go
to
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'll
go
to
my
question.
if
one
takes
that
as
a
definite
--
as
a
particularization
of
the
purposes
of
this
association,
would
the
items
which
you've
just
made
before
the
court,
as
transgressing
its
powers,
would
there
be
a
conflict
in
what
they
purported
to
exist
for
and
what
the
government
charged
him
with
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
i
should
think
the
articles
of
incorporation
are
rather
important
in
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
didn't
ask
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
they
seldom
do.
the
article
might
violate
the
law
from
your
point
of
view.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
their
profess
purposes,
as
formulated
in
the
articles
of
incorporation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
in
conflict
with
what
you
--
the
itemization
of
illegality
that
you've
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
isn't
in
print,
then
it's
in
the
--
would
you
mind
giving
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
might
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
it
is
one
yardstick
of
measurement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
open
the
question
that
you
raise
that
if
by
then
by
setting
forth
the
illegalities,
they
couldn't
make
them
legal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
didn't
--
if
they
set
forth
things
that
are
wholly
innocent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
my
point
is
that
the
--
they
may
be
measured
in
what
they
did,
by
what
they
professed
in
the
articles
of
incorporation
as
the
cause
of
their
distance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
not
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you're
going
beyond
saying
that
it
should
be
sent
back
to
judge
holtzoff
to
exercise
a
discretion.
you
say
it's
getting
on,
we
might
as
well
deal
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
of
course,
you
don't
ask
for
a
decree
on
a
case
that
hasn't
been
tried.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
couldn't
say
more
than
you've
indicated,
namely,
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
he's
not
divided
evidently
he
thought
he
was
divided
from
adding
those
other
provisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
the
courts
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
policy
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
do
not
exist
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
there
a
suggestion
--
wasn't
there
a
suggestion
in
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
that,
perhaps,
a
proper
construction
of
the
sherman
law
would
authorize
cooperatives
pursuing
nearly
the
function
of
voluntary
association
and
tells
its
interest
to
the
proper
construction
of
the
sherman
law
but
not
to
include
(inaudible)
capper-volstead
act
(inaudible)
with
the
cooperative
explicitly
out
of
condemnation
of
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
referring,
particularly,
to
what
senator
walsh
of
montana
has
said,
speaking
for
the
committee,
if
there
--
if,
indeed,
there'd
be
any
objection,
he
didn't
refer
to
the
sherman
law
as
such
but
he
indicated
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
a
classical,
what
i
call
a
classical
cooperative,
would
be
condemned
by
the
sherman
law,
if
it
merely
restrict
itself
to
doing
what
a
cooperative
does,
namely,
serve
a
common
interest
to
voluntary
membership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
2,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
throughout
his
report,
there's
a
distinction,
as
i
think,
that's
involved
in
this
case
between
being
a
cooperative
and
what
it
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
cooperative
addresses
itself
to
being
a
cooperative
and
that
section
2
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
section
2
gives
power
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
find
that,
even
being
a
--
a
cooperative,
names,
under
certain
circumstances,
on
its
findings,
begins
the
public
interest.is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
are
you
saying
that
congress
put
its
trust
for
protection
against
what
might
be
public
evil
in
the
administrative
determination
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
argument.
