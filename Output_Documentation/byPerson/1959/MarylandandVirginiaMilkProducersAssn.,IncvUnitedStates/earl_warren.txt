mr.
bergson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
bergson,
do
i
--
do
i
understand
that
it
is
your
position
that
as
long
as
these
cooperatives
operate
by
themselves
and
without
--
not
with
outsiders,
with
the
exception
of
--
of
this
one
price
factor
that
you
mentioned
that
it
can,
with
impunity,
violate
any
antitrust
law
that
has
been
established.
it
can
be
as
suppressive,
as
it
wants.
it
can
be
as
monopolistic
as
it
--
at
once
and
that
there
is
no
--
there's
no
power
in
the
antitrust
laws
to
--
to
prevent
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
i
just
want
to
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
it
conspire
the
--
the
--
suppose
borden
had
conspired
with
the
outsiders
for
some
benefit
to
borden
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
the
coop
situation.
and
suppose
the
--
the
coop
conspires
with
an
outsider
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
outsider,
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
cooperative,
would
that
make
any
distinction
between
borden
case
and
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
know,
but
you
emphasized
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
it
was
for
an
outsider
--
for
an
outsider.
you
said
two
or
three
times
out
of
the
fact
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
an
outsider,
important
to
us
here,
who
wouldn't
make
any
(inaudible)
of
those
--
for
the
outsider
or
the
insider.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice

i
think
you
made
your
questions.
chief

mr.
elman.
chief

with
the
one
exception
was
made
--
they
made

exception
as

oh,
yes.

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief

mr.

you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief

was
there
any
--
anything
in

to
indicate
what
the
--
what
that
effort
to
prevent

from

chief

how
important
it
is
--
chief

they're
not

you

warren
mr.
hughes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elman
read
us
from
the
complaint
the
allegation
that
your
client
prevented
transportation
of
milk
into
this
community.
do
you
think
that
whatever
exemption
you
have
gives
you
the
right
to
prevent
transportation
coming
out
--
milk
coming
into
the
city
of
washington?
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
judging
it
now.
i'm
not
saying,
well,
there
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
a
fair
allegation
or
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
allegation
is
there.
now,
do
you
--
do
you
include
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
in
your
exemption
that
you
may
use
methods
of
that
kind
to
coerce
people
into
and
to
prevent
transportation
into
the
city
of
milk
because
it
happens
to
compete
with
your
monopoly
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
in
the
--
in
the
secretary
of
agriculture
any
power
to
restrain
your
organization
from
preventing
other
farmers
or
other
cooperatives
from
transporting
their
milk
into
washington?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
leave
out
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
leave
out
the
price
of
proposition.
whether
you're
making
a
lot
of
money
or
whether
you're
making
little
--
a
little
money.
suppose
you're
making
a
little
money
and,
in
order
to
make
up
to
your
80%,
you
use
oppressive
methods
of
that
kind
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
you
use
--
use
methods
that
will
prevent
other
farmers
and
other
cooperatives
from
transporting
their
milk
into
washington.
does
the
secretary
of
commerce
have
any
--
any
jurisdiction
over
that
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
does?
does
anybody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
public
official
was
being
harassed
in
these
situations
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
said
that
--
you
just
said
that
a
public
official
should
not
be
harassed
in
accordance
with
judge
hand's
view.
what
public
official
is
being
harassed
by
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case?
