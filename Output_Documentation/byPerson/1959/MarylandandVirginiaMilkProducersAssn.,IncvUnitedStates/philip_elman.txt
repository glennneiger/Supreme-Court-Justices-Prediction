mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
understand
mr.
--
mr.
bergson's
argument
correctly
on
behalf
of
the
association,
he's
asking
the
court
to
interpret
the
capper-volstead
act
of
1922,
as
if
it
read
substantially
as
follows.except
to
the
extent
that
an
agricultural
cooperative
combines
or
conspires
with
outsiders
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
the
latter's
interest.
in
antitrust
laws
shall
be
entirely
inapplicable
to
agricultural
cooperatives.
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
philip
elman
that
it
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
not
really
an
exception
because
the
price
provision
is
in
section
2
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
mr.
philip
elman
now,
the
capper-volstead
act
--
mr.
philip
elman
as
i
understand
the
argument
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
the
capper
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
the
capper-volstead
act
sets
up
--
sets
up
an
exclusive
procedure
of
its
own.
mr.
philip
elman
it's
entirely
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
price
limitation.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
oh,
of
course.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
--
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
respond
to
that
precisely.
the
--
as
we
read
section
2
of
the
capper-volstead
act,
the
price
limitation,
it
deals
with
the
situation
of
undue
enhancement
of
prices,
the
--
the
charging
of
an
exorbitant
accessibly
high
price.
that
is
not
an
antitrust
standard.
the
antitrust
laws
don't
deal
with
high
or
low
prices
or
reasonable
or
unreasonable
prices.
that
--
that,
if
i
may
suggest,
is
more
comparable
to
the
lever
act
of
world
war
i
which
dealt
with
the
charging
of
unreasonably
high
prices.
and
i
think
it's
consistent
with
the
interpretation
that
you're
being
asked
to
accept.
to
regard
section
2
not
as
an
antitrust
remedy,
but
as
a
capper-volstead
undue
enhancement
of
price,
antiprofiteering
remedy.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
no.
not
--
not
at
all.
i
--
i
--
i'm
afraid
i
may
--
mr.
philip
elman
i'm
afraid
i
have
made
myself
clear.
their
argument
is
that
so
far
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
concerned,
sherman
act,
clayton
act,
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
only
respect
in
which
an
agricultural
cooperative
can
be
dealt
with
is
combination
or
conspiracy
with
third
person,
not
agricultural
producers,
borden
case.
they
also
recognized
that
an
agricultural
cooperative
which
unduly
enhances
prices,
in
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
can
be
dealt
with
under
section
2
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
yes,
sir.
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
mr.
philip
elman
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
there
might
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
our
position
is
--
mr.
philip
elman
our
position
is
that
the
scope
of
the
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws
is
determined
by
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
it's
not
absolute.
it's
not
sweeping.
it's
not
a
blanket
license
to
violate
--
mr.
philip
elman
exactly.
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
read
the
sherman
law
and
the
clayton
act
and
the
capper-volstead
act
together.
they're
all
enactments
of
congress,
they're
all
relevant
here.
and
if
--
if
there's
an
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws,
it
arises
not
by
reason
of
any
express
exemption,
not
by
reason
of
any
express
immunity
in
the
capper-volstead
act.
it
arises
by
implication,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
activities
involved
are
authorized
under
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
and
if
they
are
authorized,
if
congress
has
authorized
the
cooperative
to
do
something,
it's
clear
that
you
can't
prosecute
the
cooperative
for
doing
it.
but
it's
a
--
the
--
the
defense
is
one
which
would
have
to
be
supported
by
a
showing
of
affirmative
authorization
to
engage
in
these
activities,
to
be
found
in
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
it
is
--
this
is
not
a
situation
where
your
honors
have
before
you,
something
like
the
--
the
shipping
act
of
1916
or
the
mcguire
act,
to
the
mccarran
act.
well,
you've
got
a
statute
which
says
the
antitrust
laws
shall
not
apply
etcetera,
to
whatever
maybe
before
the
court.
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
approach
the
--
the
--
this
case,
i
respectfully
submit.
in
the
terms
as
--
which
had
--
have
been
stated
many
times
that
exceptions
to
the
--
to
the
sherman
act,
the
antitrust
laws
are
--
are
not
to
be
found
lightly,
except
that
the
--
the
repeals
by
implication
are
not
favored.
that
was
set
in
the
borden
case
itself.
and
here,
we
have
an
argument,
a
defense
to
activities
which
are
concededly
unlawful
under
the
antitrust
laws
if
engaged
in
by
an
ordinary
business
corporation.
that
--
that
concession
is
made
in
--
in
the
briefs
and
its
language
of
--
renewed
in
the
oral
argument.
we
have
no
question
here
as
to
whether
what
was
alleged
and
what
was
found,
constitute
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws,
if
the
antitrust
laws
are
considered
in
themselves.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
that
is
the
starting
point.
mr.
philip
elman
that
is
the
starting
point
so
that
in
determining
what
the
immunity
is,
we
have
to
look
to
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead.
and
--
and
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
--
refer
to
the
court
to
the
provisions
of
the
statute
which
appear
in
the
association's
brief,
page
4
(a)
of
the
appendix
and
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
56.
and
congress
provided
that
persons
engaged
in
the
production
of
agricultural
products
as
farmers,
planters,
ranchmen,
dairymen,
nut
or
fruit
growers
may
act
together
in
associations,
corporate
or
otherwise,
with
or
without
capital
stock
in
correctively
processing,
preparing
for
market,
handling
and
marketing
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
such
products
of
persons
so
engaged.
such
associations
may
have
marketing
agencies
in
common.
and
such
associations
and
their
members,
they
make
the
necessary
contracts
and
agreements
to
affect
such
purposes.
so
the
question
which
is
before
you
is
whether
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
as
to
section
2,
the
monopolization
charge
which
the
district
court
did
not
allow
to
be
tried
since
he
dismissed
the
complaint
in
that
respect
and
upheld
the
defense
of
immunity
and
which
therefore
must
be
taken
as
true,
whether
the
findings
of
fact
as
to
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
section
3
of
the
sherman
act
which
he
made
after
the
trial,
whether
on
the
basis
of
the
--
of
the
act
--
activities
shown
by
those
allegations
and
findings
of
fact,
whether
they
are
embraced
within
section
1's
authorization.
and
it's
the
government's
position
that
they
are
not
embraced
within
section
1.
for
that
reason,
there
is
no
immunity
under
capper-volstead.
and
for
that
reason,
the
district
court
erred
insofar
as
he
dismissed
the
complaint
as
to
section
2.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
under
--
under
section
6
of
the
clayton
act,
it
was
clear
that
the
mere
existence
of
an
agricultural
cooperative
which
did
not
have
capital
stock
was
not
in
itself
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
was
also
clear
that
the
members
could
not
be
proceeded
against
for
lawfully
carrying
out
the
legitimate
objects
thereof,
but
it
was
not
clear
what
was
a
legitimate
object
of
an
agricultural
cooperative
and
because
the
section
6
of
the
clayton
act
did
not
apply
to
cooperatives
having
capital
stock
and
because
it
wasn't
clear
that
a
cooperative
could
be
formed
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
single
marketing
agency
for
the
single
price
for
all
the
members
who
--
for
all
the
farmers
who
were
--
who
joined
that
cooperative,
since
an
agreement
to
fix
prices
would
--
would
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
impetus
came
for
the
enactment
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
and
it's
--
it's
--
there's
question,
no
question
at
all
that
the
--
that
that
act
of
1922
served
a
--
a
very
valuable
purpose
so
far
as
congress
was
concerned
in
removing
doubts
as
to
the
legality
of
the
existence
of
these
foreign
cooperatives
and
removing
doubts
as
to
the
extent
to
which
they
could
eliminate
price
competition
among
the
members
of
the
cooperative
in
dealing
with
large
processors
and
large
middlemen.
and
the
--
the
gist
of
--
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
capper-volstead
authorization
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
permit
a
cooperative
which
has
obtained
a
dominant
position
in
the
market
to
use
that
position
for
the
purpose
of
driving
out
the
competition
of
independent
farmers
who
decided
not
to
join
the
cooperative
or
to
join
some
other
cooperatives.
mr.
philip
elman
certainly,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
not
at
all.
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
mr.
justice,
if
i
--
if
i
may
end
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
to
that
question.
mr.
philip
elman
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
even
though
the
opening
argument
here
was
made
by
agreement
of
counsel
by
the
associations,
we
do
not
regard
ourselves
as
the
victorious
party
in
the
district
court.
we
--
we
think
that
the
heart
of
this
case
is
the
section
2
monopolization
charge
which
the
district
court
did
not
try.
we
are
not
satisfied
with
the
divestiture
of
the
assets
of
the
embassy
dairy
directed
by
the
--
the
district
court.
we
think
that
the
complaint
alleged
the
monopoly,
going
back
to
1932
and
that
if
we
succeed
in
substantiating
the
allegations
of
the
complaint;
we
will
be
entitled
to
relief
going
far
beyond
the
mere
recision
of
the
embassy
transaction.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
going
on
with
the
arguments
on
the
law,
that
is
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
capper-volstead
act
and
the
borden
case,
which
is
a
very
important
case
here,
since
it's
the
only
case
which
has
come
before
this
court
since
the
enactment
of
the
capper-volstead
act,
which
bears
upon
the
relationship
of
that
act
to
the
antitrust
laws.
before
doing
that,
i
should
like
to
put
the
issues
upon
this
case
and
its
factual
context
and
to
review
the
facts
in
the
record.
there
is
one
preliminary
point
that
may
have
been
left
uncertain
by
the
argument
yesterday
afternoon
and
that
is
as
to
the
role
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
relation
to
the
acquisition
of
the
assets
of
the
embassy
dairy.
it
was
suggested
that
the
secretary
may
have
approved
that
acquisition.
now,
that
question
was
specifically
dealt
with
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
to
which
there's
no
challenge
here
and
that's
to
be
found
in
the
record
on
pages
493
and
494
of
volume
2.
there,
judge
holtzoff
deals
specifically
with
the
argument
that
the
approval
of
a
loan
by
the
baltimore
bank
for
cooperatives,
which
was
part
of
the
farm
credit
administration,
represented
the
defense.
and
the
bottom
paragraph
of
the
page,
mentions
the
fact
as
to
that
loan.
at
the
top
of
page
494,
he
says
there
is
--
the
evidence
does
not
sustain
the
defense
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
there
is
no
statutory
provision
empowering
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
approve
any
transaction
such
as
is
involved
here
and
secondly,
the
transaction
was
not
authorized
either
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
or
by
anyone
acting
in
his
behalf.
and
i
might
refer
the
court,
so
far
as
the
evidence
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
solely
from
a
credit
standpoint.
and
i
--
i
think,
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
record
at
page,
653,
plaintiff's
exhibit
114,
where
the
bank,
in
connection
with
the
pretrial
proceedings
here,
was
specifically
asked.
this
is
question
1,
the
bottom
of
page
653
of
the
record,
“did
the
baltimore
bank
for
cooperatives,
through
its
executive
committee
or
otherwise,
(a)
authorize,
(b)
direct,
(c)
approve,
(d)
declare
a
fine
to
be
in
the
public
interest,
or
(e)
sanctioned
the
acquisition
of
assets
of
embassy
dairy,
incorporated,
by
maryland
and
virginia
milk
producers
association?”
answer,
this
is
the
bank's
answer,
“no.”
the
bank
did,
however,
approve
and
make
a
loan
for
the
defendant.”
so,
all
you
have
is
the
making
of
the
loan
and
there
is
no
statutory
authorization
that
either
the
association
or
the
government
has
been
able
to
find,
which
permits
the
secretary
to
approve
such
an
acquisition.
and,
he
didn't
--
and
in
any
event,
he
did
not
purport
to
do
so.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
i'm
not
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
assuming
he
did,
which
we
don't
believe
he
had.
mr.
philip
elman
we
denied
that
he
had
the
power,
but
even
if
he
did
have
the
power,
he
did
not
exercise
the
power
so
as
to
approve
his
acquisition.
mr.
philip
elman
there's
no
statute
that
we
know
of
that
gives
him
the
power
to
approve
an
acquisition
which
will
otherwise
be
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
or
sections
1
and
3
of
the
sherman
act,
apart
from
the
capper-volstead
act
argument
that's
made
here
in
this
case.
if
the
capper-volstead
act
gives
him
that
authority,
then
--
then,
of
course,
we
have
the
question
whether
he
--
he
exercised
it
here.
and
we
say,
on
the
basis
of
the
finding
made
by
the
court
here
in
the
undisputed
evidence,
he
didn't.
mr.
philip
elman
we
depend
on
both.
mr.
philip
elman
well
if
--
if
it's
true
that
the
capper-volstead
act
give
--
does
give
the
secretary
of
agriculture
the
power
to
immunize
from
the
antitrust
laws
an
acquisition
that
would
otherwise
violate
those
laws
then,
if
he
did
grant
such
immunity,
of
course,
that
would
be
a
full
defense.
but,
you
see
--
mr.
philip
elman
you
see,
there
are
two
--
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
think
it
would
fall
in
line.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
and
--
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
is
just
another
way
of
presenting
their
argument
that
the
grant
of
power
to
the
secretary
under
section
2
of
capper-volstead,
that
grant
of
power
is
equivalent
to
taking
out
from
under
the
antitrust
laws
the
question
of
the
legality
of
--
of
the
activities
including
the
acquisition.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
we
certainly
do.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it's
not
only
not
possible
to
draw
that
inference,
the
bank
itself,
contradicts
the
drawing
of
any
such
inference.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
that
the
bank's
action
in
this
case,
as
it
fully
appears
from
the
memoranda
surrounding
this
transaction
and
its
--
its
own
statement,
the
bank
was
concerned
with
the
financial
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
this
--
mr.
philip
elman
this
thing
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
mr.
philip
elman
i
fully
agree.
now,
as
to
the
facts,
as
we
stated
yesterday,
we
have
three
causes
of
action
here.
one
of
them
was
not
tried.
that's
the
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
monopolization
charge
which,
as
i
said,
from
our
standpoint
is
the
most
important
phase
of
this
case.
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
from
our
stand
--
from
our
standpoint,
the
embassy
--
the
acquisition
in
1954
from
the
embassy
assets
was
about
one
--
perhaps
the
most
significant
and
most
dramatic,
but
it
was
about
one
part
of
a
--
an
attempted
monopolization
which,
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
began
in
1930
and
the
relief
that
the
government
is
seeking
for
the
protection
of
other
cooperatives
and
for
the
protection
of
independent
farmers
who
are
not
members
of
this
cooperative
would
be,
we
believe,
far
more
effective
and
far
more
beneficial
to
them
and
to
the
public
than
the
mere
divestiture
that
was
ordered
here.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it
would
--
it
would
include
an
injunction
against
the
--
the
acts
and
similar
acts
such
as
there
are
alleged
in
the
complaint.
and,
i
would
like
to
go
immediately
to
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
here
as
to
what
was
done.the
complaint
as
to
section
2
alleged
that
this
association
which
was
organized
in
1923
has,
from
--
at
least
from
1931
to
the
present
time,
controlled
somewhere
between
85%
and
95%
of
the
supply
of
milk
in
the
washington
metropolitan
area.
the
exact
figure
has
varied
from
time
to
time.
and
this
cooperative,
which
as
close
to
2,000
members,
has
never
achieved
a
100%
monopoly
in
the
sense
that
every
farmer
in
the
maryland
and
virginia
producing
area
became
a
member.
at
all
times,
they
were
independent
farmers
who
chose
not
to
become
members
of
the
association,
who
preferred
to
sell
either
directly
to
the
dairies,
the
distributors,
or
through
some
other
cooperative.
now,
this
is
--
this
cooperative
is
of
course,
by
far,
the
largest
cooperative
in
this
area
but
it
is
not
the
only
one.
there
are
three
other
such
cooperatives
which
are
here
now
and
which
have
tried,
from
time
to
time,
to
gain
a
foothold
in
the
market,
and
one
is
the
capital
milk
producers
cooperative
which
sells
to
the
high's
retail
stores.
there's
the
valley
of
virginia
cooperative
which
sells
through
alexandria
dairy,
and
there's
queen
city
cooperative
that
sells
through
the
harvey's
dairy.
and,
these
other
cooperatives
are
cooperatives
of
the
same
farmers
that
you
have
in
this
association
farmers
in
the
maryland
and
virginia
area,
and
the
gist
of
the
monopolization
charge
here
is
that
this
defendant-association
has
used
its
dominant
position
in
controlling
the
supply
of
milk
in
this
area.
mr.
philip
elman
absolutely
nothing
else?
mr.
philip
elman
no,
sir.
if
all
you
have
here
--
mr.
philip
elman
is
a
voluntary
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
let
me
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
correctly
and
that
you
understand
my
answer
correctly.
if
you
have
a
purely
voluntary
joining
together
of
the
farmers
--
mr.
philip
elman
for
the
purpose
of
collectively
marketing
their
milk
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
all
you
have
--
mr.
philip
elman
you
have
nothing
directed
in
the
way
of
--
practice
as
directed
against
nonmembers
or
people
who
might
choose
to
leave
the
association,
nothing
in
the
way
of
eliminating
competition
--
mr.
philip
elman
at
the
wholesale
level,
no
denial
of
access
to
the
market
by
anybody
else,
in
other
words,
we're
taking
out
of
this
case
everything
that
makes
the
case
what
it
is
and
why
it's
here.
if
you
take
everything
out
of
the
case
--
mr.
philip
elman
except
that
voluntary
--
mr.
philip
elman
except
the
monopoly.
mr.
philip
elman
a
monopoly
--
a
monopoly
as
to
the
marketing
of
milk
by
members
who
have
voluntarily
joined
together,
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
charter
of
association.
mr.
philip
elman
it
is
also
a
charter
of
non-association
--
mr.
philip
elman
insofar
--
mr.
philip
elman
insofar
as
in
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
they
can
--
so
far
as
the
--
as
the
farmers
who
--
who
voluntarily
want
to
join
the
association
are
concerned,
any
elimination
of
competition
among
themselves
as
to
fixing
of
price
is
perfectly
alright.
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
but
the
gravamen
of
this
case,
the
gravamen
of
the
charge
here
is
that
they
used
their
voluntary
combination
which
capper-volstead
authorizes
to
club
nonmembers
into
--
into
leaving
the
market
or
joining
the
association,
giving
them
that
choice.
now,
we
say
that
there's
nothing
in
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead
act,
which
is
the
source
of
the
immunity
here,
which
authorizes
anything
going
beyond
the
voluntary
association
you've
cited
in
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
hope
your
honors
will
bear
with
me
if
i
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
take
you
through
the
record.
i'd
like
to
be
as
specific
as
i
can
about
rather
than
using
generalities
--
mr.
philip
elman
you're
not
--
you're
serving
--
mr.
philip
elman
you're
serving
my
purpose,
mr.
justice.
i
--
i
could
summarize
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
here
by
saying
that
the
--
it
alleged
that
they
obtained,
maintained,
and
extended
their
monopoly
power
through
the
use
of
activities
for
the
use
acts
which
were
not
authorized
by
section
1
of
the
capper-volstead
act
and
which,
if
done
by
an
ordinary
business
corporation
concededly,
would
be
unlawful
under
the
antitrust
laws.
that's
the
broad
outline.
now,
what
did
the
--
what
did
the
complaint
say
specifically?
if
the
court
will
refer
to
volume
1
of
the
record,
page
17,
you
will
find
the
allegations
dealing
with
section
2.
paragraph
21
recites
generally
the
beginning
in
1930
and
continuing
thereafter
up
to
an
including
the
time
of
the
complaint,
the
defendant
has
attempted
to
monopolize
and
has
monopolized
interstate
trade
and
commerce
in
the
supply
of
milk
for
resale
as
fluid
milk
in
this
area.
paragraph
22
specifies
10
respects
in
which
that
attempt
of
monopolization
was
carried
out.
i
will
refer
only
to
two
of
them
subparagraph
(b)
of
paragraph
22,
that
the
defendant
has
excluded,
eliminated,
attempted
to
eliminate
others,
including
producers,
its
farmers,
and
producers
agricultural
cooperative
associations
not
affiliated
with
the
defendant
from
supplying
milk
to
dealers,
dealers
being
the
word
for
“dairies”
like
seal
tests,
counts,
and
so
on.
subparagraph
(k),
on
the
next
page,
the
defendant
has
eliminated
and
attempted
to
eliminate
competition
with
its
dealer
customers
by
dealers
purchasing
milk
from
others
than
the
defendant.
on
paragraph
25
(c),
on
page
19,
under
violations
of
sections
1
and
3,
subparagraphs
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
referred
to
the
embassy
transaction.
and,
(a)
and
(b)
alleged
the
making
of
the
contract,
the
agreement
by
the
owners
of
embassy
that
they
will
not
engage
in
the
sale
or
distribution
of
milk
in
this
area
and
paragraph
(c),
the
defendant
and
co-conspirators,
that's
the
owners
of
embassy,
made
arrangements
for
and
assisted
in
the
diversion
or
foreclosure
of
producers
of
milk
who
had
supplied
embassy
from
independently
supplying
their
milk
to
the
washington
metropolitan
area
market,
giving
such
producers
the
alternative
of
supplying
co-conspirators,
green
spring
dairy,
inc.
at
baltimore.
that's
the
dairy
that
was
owned
by
the
owners
of
embassy
in
baltimore,
giving
them
the
choice
of
either
going
to
the
baltimore
market
or
becoming
members
of
the
defendant
[association].
again,
on
page
20
in
the
following
paragraph,
paragraph
26,
it's
again
alleged
that
this
contract,
i'm
reading
now
from
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph,
“the
aforesaid
contract
was
made
and
executed
by
the
defendant
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
embassy
as
an
outlet
in
the
washington
metropolitan
area
for
milk
produced
by
others
than
the
defendant
and
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
competition
in
said
area
between
embassy
and
dealers
purchasing
the
requirements
of
milk
from
the
defendant.”
now
there
were
extensive
pretrial
proceedings
here.
judge
holtzoff
ordered
the
government
to
supply
particularizations
of
these
general
allegations,
and
the
government
furnished
a
statement
of
particulars
and
three
supplements
to
that
statement
of
particulars.
they
appear
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
35.
the
statement
of
particulars
starts
at
35
and
goes
on
to
5
--
page
57.
the
supplements
begin
at
page
68.
and,
there
are,
by
my
count,
143
specific
acts
specified,
particularized
under
the
general
allegations
of
the
complaint.
and
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
all
this
must
be
taken
as
proof
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
since
the
defense
of
immunity
was
sustained
without
committing
the
allegations
to
be
tried.
you
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
philip
elman
whether
it
is
in
the
--
whether
it's
in
the
printed
record
or
not
but
i
think
it's
in
the
record
that's
filed
with
the
court.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
we
think
--
we
think
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
we
think
that
if
the
articles
of
incorporation
had
said
that
our
purpose
is
to
eliminate
the
competition
of
nonmembers,
then
there
would
be
a
conflict
between
that
authorization
and
the
authorization
given
to
the
cooperative
by
section
1
of
capper-volstead.
mr.
philip
elman
but,
i
don't
think
that's
what
this
is.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
can't
answer
your
question
without
looking
at
the
charter
of
the
corporation
but
i
would
be
very
much
surprised
if
it's
--
if
there
were
anything
in
it
that
said
the
purpose
of
the
cooperative
is
to
monopolize
and
to
club
nonmembers.
mr.
philip
elman
i'd
be
very
happy
to
furnish
it
now.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
our
argument
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
we
don't
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
perhaps
i
can
--
i
can
relieve
your
mind
by
saying
that
we
do
not
argue,
so
far
as
i
know,
and
have
not
argued
in
the
court
below
that
there's
anything
in
the
charter
of
incorporation
which
is
the
basis
for
illegality.
the
basis
for
lega
--
the
illegality
is
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
what
they
did,
not
what
they
started
out
in
1923
saying
they
were
going
to
do.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
well
as
to
what
they
actually
did,
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me
to
the
extent
of
a
few
minutes
to
refer
to
some
of
these
specific
items
that
are
stated
in
the
government's
statement
of
particulars.

38,
under
subparagraph
(b)
of
paragraph
2,
the
allegation

subparagraph

paragraph

on

refers
to
an
incident
during
the
period
1938
to
1940,
the
fairfax

embassy
dairy,
the
defendant
required
that
they
agree
not
to
purchase
milk
from
producers
or
suppliers
in
addition
to
those
producers
or
suppliers
that
they
were
then
supplying.
and,
on
page

they
attempted
to
arrange
with
james
j.
ward,
he
was
the
owner
of
embassy,
that
producer
supplying
milk
to
embassy
would
be
switched
to
the
baltimore
market
and,
paragraph
8,
an
allegation
that
they
attempted
to
prevent
or
interfere
with
the
shipment
of
milk
to
the
washington
area
market
by
producers
not
members
to
the

particularly,
by
attempting
to
prevent

of
nonmember
farmers
on
the

of
that
named
dairy
and
others.

no.9,
activities
directed
against
another
co-op,
activities
to
exclude
valley
of
virginia
producers
association
as
a
supplier
of
milk,
the
same
kind
of
allegation
in
paragraph
10.
now,
if
i
may
--
mr.
philip
elman
these
weren't
tried.
mr.
philip
elman
it
wasn't
tried.
it
wasn't
tried,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
elman
and,
as
far
as
i
know,
there
wasn't
any
interest
at
that
time.
now,
on
the
next
page,
as
one
of
the
allegations
under
the
monopolization
charge,
paragraph
14
refers
to
the
acquiring
of
assets
of
embassy
dairy
in
the
--
1954,
and
arranging
for
the
diversion
from
the
washington
market
or
absorption
in
the

of
milk
producers
who
supplied
embassy
as
independent

of
milk
and
foreclosing
from
the
washington
market
of
other
suppliers
of
milk
who
also
furnished
milk
to
embassy.
page

there's
another
allegation
the
court
might
be
interested
in.
paragraph
13
on
page
42
of
the
record,
such
charge
that
the
defendant
association
threatened
and

the
boycott
by
dairy
farmer
members
of
defendant
of
feed
and
farm
supply
outlets
owned
by
one
herbert
bryan
in

about
1956,
which
was
two
years
after
the
acquisition
of
embassy
in
order
to
compel
eastern
dairy
products
corporation
of
alexandria,
virginia,
also
owned
by
bryan,
to
purchase
from
defendant
milk
for
resale
as
fluid
milk.
if
i

now
to

is
one
of
the
supplements
to

on

these
further

well,
the
theory
--
the
theory
of
the
monopoly
charged
is
essentially
the
one
that
was
declared
by
the
court
in
the
griffith
case
that
monopoly
power,
even
if
it's
lawfully
acquired,
cannot
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
a
competitor
for
foreclosing
it
in
the
market
now.
mr.
philip
elman
we
have
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
it's
voluntarily
obtained.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
and
all
we're
asking
for
is
an
opportunity
to
try
them
out.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
we're
not
asking
--
mr.
philip
elman
we're
not
asking
--
we're
not
asking
your
honors
to
write
a
decree
on
section
2
at
this
stage.
all
we
want
--
mr.
philip
elman
oh
no.
mr.
philip
elman
all
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
precisely,
what
we
want
on
section
2
is
a
decision
by
this
court
that
the
district
court
erroneously
sustained
the
def
--
the
affirmative
defense.
he
disposed
of
the
section
2
case
on
the
pleadings.
and,
at
the
section
2,
this
is
a
pleadings
case
and
if
your
--
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
government,
all
we're
entitled
to
is
an
order
sending
the
case
back
for
trial.
mr.
philip
elman
but
--
mr.
philip
elman
no.
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question,
as
i
understood
it,
was
whether
we
couldn't
get
everything
that
we
wanted
under
section
3
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
answer
to
that
question
was
no.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
we
--
we
have
--
we
have
included
in
our
cross
appeal
here
certain
questions
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
section
3
relief,
the
relief
as
to
divestiture
of
the
embassy
assets.
those
are
minor
questions.
i
--
i
would
prefer
to
leave
them
to
the
brief,
but
i
will
discuss
them
if
i
have
an
opportunity
later
on
there.
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
think
there
are
of
any
considerable
magnitude.
the
provisions
that
we
think
the
district
court
should
have
included
in
the
decree
but
didn't,
from
our
point
of
view,
are
standard
routine
antitrust
provisions
and
there
was
no
responsible
exercise
of
discretion
on
his
part
to
keep
them
out
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
that's
probably
the
most
important
one,
but
where
we
stand
as
to
all
the
objections
to
the
decree
that
are
in
our
brief.
as
to
visitation,
for
example,
if
i
may
take
a
moment
to
deal
with
that
since
it's
been
raised,
the
government
prop
--
which
had
won
section
3
and
section
7,
and
there
was
no
question
about
the
divestiture,
the
district
court.
and
the
defendants
recognized
that
where
there's
a
violation
of
section
7,
the
proper
relief
is
divestiture.
we
had
included
a
provision
that
the
government
would
have
the
right
to
inspect
the
books
and
records
of
the
defendant-association
at
its
office,
at
its
convenience,
and
so
on.
and,
we
thought
that
was
an
important
provision
because
the
decree
had
standards
into
this
for
the
good
faith
of
the
association,
and
so
on.
that
kind
of
provision
in
the
antitrust
decree
is
included
in
every
consent
decree
that
i've
seen.
it's
--
it's
and
as
i
say,
routine
standard
and
there's
no
requirement.
it
isn't
mandatory
that
it
be
included.
this
court
in
the
bausch
and
lomb
case
in
321
u.s.
said
that
the
district
court
had
some
discretion
in
the
matter.
and
if
judge
holtzoff
had
exercised
the
discretion
here,
if
he
had
said,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
or
appropriate
here
and
on
the
basis
of
what
we
had
in
the
facts
here,”
that
--
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
situation.
what
--
what
he
said
was,
as
i
--
he
looked
at
this
provision,
he
said,
“i
think
this
is
a
police
state
provision.
this
is
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
well
you
couldn't
ask.
you
couldn't
impose
this
requirement
on
criminals,
so
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
impose
it
on
honest
businessmen.”
the
word
“honest”
was
his
word,
not
mine.
and
he
thought,
in
effect,
that
it
was
mandatory
to
omit
that
provision
from
the
decree.
and
as
i
say,
if
it's
an
--
if
it's
a
question
of
discretion,
if
he
had
exercised
discretion,
we
wouldn't
be
objecting.
but
he
--
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
kind
of
question
we
have
on
the
relief
and
i
would
like
to
leave
them
to
the
brief.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
on
section
3
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7,
that
part
of
the
case
was
tried.
there,
you
have
a
decree
and
we
are
saying
that
that
decree
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
was
not
fully
effective
to
undo
the
violations
which
the
district
court
found,
and
that
is
properly
before
you
for
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
modification.
mr.
philip
elman
as
for
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
section
3
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
may
i
--
may
i
say
this,
i
--
that
the
--
that
the
questions
as
to
the
decree,
the
inadequacy
of
the
decree
that
we
have
raised,
would
also
arise,
we
think,
for
example,
this
visitation
provision,
would
also
arise
under
a
section
2
decree,
if
you're
--
if
the
court
were
to
send
the
case
back
under
section
2
and
if
we
won
and
the
--
and
the
judge
were
to
give
us
a
decree,
you'd
have
the
same
question.
we
thought
that
since
it
was,
from
our
point
of
view,
the
case
has
got
to
go
back
anyway,
it
might
be
helpful
to
give
the
court
guidance
not
only
as
to
the
section
2
part
which
isn't
quite
ready
for
your
honors'
decision
as
to
the
decree
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
but
as
to
the
section
3
and
section
7
which
is
before
your
honors.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
mr.
philip
elman
justice
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it's
one
case.
it's
one
complaint
and
one
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
trial,
but
there
were
--
there
were
separate
judgments
as
to
section
2
in
the
sherman
act.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
they're
separate
judgments.
mr.
philip
elman
page
74
and
75,
you
have
the
judgment
of
the
court
as
to
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
record
74
and
75
is
a
judgment,
dated
november
10th,
1958,
as
to
section
3
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
that's
the
judgment
as
to
section
2.
he
sustains
the
defense
of
capper-volstead
as
to
section
2,
the
monopolization.
and
then,
on
page
85,
he
has
his
judgment
as
to
--
in
favor
of
the
government.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
but
i
know
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
i
think
--
i
think
it's
one
suit,
mr.
justice.
you
have
complaint
setting
forth
three
causes
of
action,
but
i
don't
think
that
makes
it
three
lawsuits.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
now,
up
to
now,
i've
talked
about
allegations
which
haven't
been
tried.
there
are
findings
of
fact
here
as
to
the
acquisition
of
the
embassy
dairy's
assets
in
1954.
that
was
fully
tried.
you
have
--
there
was
extensive
oral
testimony
by
the
parties
to
the
transaction.
there
were
documentary
exhibits
and,
particularly,
significant
with
those
referred
to
by
the
district
court
in
his
opinion,
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
480.
there
were
contemporaneous
memoranda
furnished
by
the
directors
of
the
association
to
its
members
and
to
this
baltimore
bank
for
cooperatives
which
described
the
reasons
for
this
acquisition,
so
that,
we
have
a
very
full
factual
record
on
that
phase
of
the
case.
now,
what
was
the
situation
as
to
embassy?
in
1954,
the
defendant-association
controlled
86%
of
the
supply
of
milk
in
this
area.
there
were
about
a
dozen
dairies
distributors
to
whom
--
who
were,
in
effect,
the
wholesalers
of
milk.
the
big
three,
the
three
largest
chestnut
farms,
thompsons,
lucerne
which
is
division
of
safeways,
in
which,
themselves,
counted
from
well-over
70%
of
the
sales
of
milk
in
this
area.
they
bought
all
or
practically
all
of
their
milk
from
the
defendant
association.
there
were
some
other
dairies.
the
fourth
largest
dairy
was
embassy.
embassy
had
about
10%
of
the
market.
86%
to
the
association,
10%
embassy,
and
this
leaves
6%
for
the
remainder,
and
i
don't
think
it's
very
significant
in
the
context
of
this
case
but
embassy
was
important
because
embassy
did
not
buy
from
the
association.
embassy
bought
its
milk
from
122
independent
farmers
who
are
not
members
of
this
association.
embassy
was
a
vigorous
aggressive
competitor,
in
relation
to
the
customers
of
this
association.
embassy
cut
prices,
particularly,
in
the
sales
of
milk
to
the
federal
government
for
using
in
federal
installations
in
this
area
like
fort
myer
and
old
soldiers'
home,
and
so
on.
the
federal
government
bought
about
$2
million
worth
of
milk
each
year
and
embassy,
which
was
--
which
was
the
number
four
dairy
in
the
area,
was
able
to
get
47%
of
that
business.
and,
it
was
able
to
do
that
because
it
submitted
low
bids.
the
association's
customers
were
able
to
sell
only
45%
to
the
government
and,
in
order
to
get
hat
45%,
they
had
to
reduce
their
prices
to
the
level
of
embassy's
bids.
and
in
--
and
in
order
to
permit
that
arrangement,
the
association
had
to
reduce
the
price
that
it
was
charging
its
customers.
i
hope
i've
made
that
clear.
it's
fully
spelled
out
in
the
memorandum
which
the
general
manager
of
the
association
submitted
to
the
members
of
the
association
in
1954
in
explaining
why
they
wanted
to
acquire
embassy.
this
is
on
page
542
of
the
record.
he
says
there
that
“the
fact
that
embassy
was
buying
its
milk
from
these
independents
was
costing
the
association
about
$700,000
a
year.”
then,
in
the
next
paragraph,
he
said
that
“it
isn't
limited
to
the
fact
that
embassy
is
not
buying
its
milk
from
us.
there's
this
contract
milk
which
is
sold
to
the
federal
government.
as
a
result,
of
the
dairy's,
that's
embassy's,
ability
to
under-buy
and,
therefore,
undercut
in
their
bidding,
it
has
been
necessary
for
the
association
to
drop
the
price
to
a
competitive
level.
that
is,
to
the
price
of
embassy's
able
to
buy
their
milk.”
and,
that
that
--
this
is
costing
the
association
something
like
$2
million
a
year.
the
district
court
found
that
this
acquisition
of
embassy's
assets,
which
were
worth
$1,600,000,
was
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
the
competition
of
the
122
producers.
as
a
result
of
the
acquisition,
these
122
farmers,
the
district
court
found,
were
compelled
to
leave
this
market
or
to
join
the
association.
the
--
the
purpose
of
this
transaction
is
abundantly
demonstrated
by
the
record.
there
was
a
testimony
by
the
president
of
thompsons
diary,
for
example.
that
while
the
negotiations
were
in
progress,
he
was
approached
by
the
manager
of
the
association
and
he
was
told
that
he
should
not
attempt
to
acquire
the
--
to
buy
his
milk
from
the
--
from
any
of
these
122
farmers
who
have
been
shipping
to
embassy
because
that
would
“queer”
the
deal.
the
memoranda
submitted
to
the
bank
all
showed
that
the
purpose
of
this
transaction
was
to
foreclose
these
independent
markets,
to
cut
off
their
normal
market
outlet,
to
give
them
the
choice
either
of
leaving
the
washington
market,
as
many
of
them
did,
or
of
joining
the
association.
now,
as
far
as
--
mr.
philip
elman
that
underscoring
was
--
was
made
for
the
benefit
of
the
district
court.
the
significant
portions
were
underscored
and
that's
the
way
it
was
printed.
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
minute
or
two
of
my
remaining
time
to
say
something
about
the
borden
case
in
the
legislative
history.
the
borden
case
was
not
a
case
which
holds,
as
the
defendant
argues,
that
there
is
an
absolute
sweeping
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
for
cooperatives
but
it
doesn't
go
so
far
as
to
immunize
combinations
involving
outsiders.
the
very
same
arguments
that
are
being
made
here
that
section
2
entirely
displaces
the
antitrust
laws,
that
it
gives
a
remedy
which
is
exclusive,
was
better
than
--
that
section
2,
in
effect,
denies
persons
who
are
injured
by
actions
such
as
these.
independent
farmers
who
were
driven
out
of
the
market
by
clubbing
tactics,
that
they
have
no
action
for
damages,
that
there's
no
criminal
action,
as
in
borden.
that
is
very
same
argument
was
accepted
by
the
district
court
in
the
borden
case
and
the
--
this
court,
in
the
unanimous
opinion
by
chief
justice
hughes
said,
“we
are
unable
to
accept
that
view
of
section
2.
section
2
is
merely
a
qualification
on
section
1.
section
2
is
intended
to
serve
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
public
against
the
excessive
prices
where
the
activities
permitted
by
section
1,
in
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
unduly
enhanced
prices.
that
section
2
is
a
valuable
provision
because
without
it,
there
would
be
no
protection
for
the
public
as
to
activities
which
are
authorized
by
section
1.
but,
if
it's
--
it
distorts
the
whole
function
and
scope
of
section
2
which,
incidentally,
has
never
been
used
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
that
we
have
--
that
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
any
administrative
interpretation
or
construction
of
it.
section
2
is
not
the
provision
which
in
it
--
which
repeals
antitrust
remedies.
that,
i
can
say
to
that
only,
that
this
--
this
argument
was
fully
made
to
this
court
in
the
borden
case.
the
legislative
history
materials,
which
are
relied
on
here,
were
--
were
presented
to
the
court
in
the
briefs
of
the
borden
company
and
the
pure
milk
company.
the
court
considered
them.
the
court
had
the
district
court
decision
before
accepting
that
argument
and
it
rejected
it.
and,
if
the
--
all
your
honors
have
to
do
is
reread
the
borden
case
to
see
that.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
we
think
that
the
situation
of
the
labor
union
is
entirely
dissimilar.
you've
got
a
different
history
as
to
labor
unions.
labor
unions
aren't
engaged
in
the
marketing
of
commodities,
to
begin
with.
as
to
labor
unions,
congress,
as
this
court
held
in
the
allen
bradley
case
and
the
hutcheson
case,
enacted
the
state
statutes
and
it's
upon
the
clayton
act,
norris-laguardia,
then
of
course,
we
have
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
that
part,
the
act
of
1959.
there's
a
different
minor
growth
in
the
last
brief
of
labor
unions.
all
you
have,
as
to
agricultural
offers,
is
the
capper-volstead.
now,
you
also
have
the
agricultural
market
agreement
of
1957
which
deals
with
this
problem
of
protecting
cooperatives
and
protecting
farmers,
generally,
from
the
--
against
the
(inaudible)

farm
places
and
so
on.
the
congress
(inaudible)
to
buy
in
the
market
would
have
happened
in
most
agreements
which
had
certain
procedures(inaudible).
in
1957,

given
to
agricultural
cooperatives
by

as
immunity.
it
has
a
limited
function
and,
that
is,
the
act
of
an
agreement
(inaudible).
mr.
philip
elman
(inaudible)
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
you
have
nothing
at
all
comparable
to
those
legislative
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
acts
here.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
the
big
--
the
big
ambiguity
that
was
resolved
by
the
capper-volstead
act
is
how
far
the
“legitimate”
object
to
the
association,
provision
under
section
6
of
the
clayton
act,
go
and
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
members
of
a
cooperative
could
--
could
voluntarily
join
together,
set
up
a
single
marketing
agency,
market
their
products
with
a
single
price,
which
would
otherwise
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
and
make
sure
that
did
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
but,
the
--
the
house
committee
report,
which
is
quoted
on
page
21
(a)
of
the
association's
voluminous
appendix
on
legislative
history,
after
referring
to
that
purpose,
says
that
in
the
event
that
associations
authorized
by
this
bill
shall
do
anything
forbidden
by
the
sherman
antitrust
act,
they
will
be
subject
to
the
penalties
imposed
by
that
law,
not
the
penalties
imposed
by
section
2,
the
penalties
imposed
by
the
sherman
law.
mr.
philip
elman
well
that's
a
far
cry
from
the
--
from
saying
that
the
legislative
history
is
conclusive
that
congress
intended
to
take
foreign
cooperatives
entirely
out
from
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
may
i
--
may
i
answer
that
as
to
sec
--
senator
walsh.
senator
walsh
was
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
which
was
opposed
to
section
2.
mr.
philip
elman
he
was
not
a
sponsor
of
the
provision
which
is
relied
on
here.
senator
walsh
was
--
and
the
senate
judiciary
committee
were
concerned
that
a
cooperative
might
form
a
monopoly
of
the
--
of
supply
just
through
the
voluntary
aggregation
of
the
farmers,
and
that's
where
the
--
that's
what
they
were
worried
about
and
they
were
defeated.
however,
on
the
question
of
whether
a
cooperative
which
had
obtained
the
monopoly
could
use
that
monopoly
to
drive
out
nonmembers
through
unfair
methods
of
competition,
you
have
a
statement
on
page
39
(a)
of
the
appendix.
that
of
course,
if
this
association
shall
practice
unfair
methods
of
competition
for
the
purpose
of
driving
their
competitors
out
of
business,
i
dare
say,
they
would
still
be
amenable
to
discipline
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
at
least
i
hope
so.
but,
mr.
--
president,
that
is
not
the
situation
which
presents
itself
at
all.
the
federal
trade
commission
will
take
care
of
all
these
unfair
methods
of
competition
by
its
processes.
the
situation
that
he
was
talking
about,
the
situation
that
the
senate
amendment
was
directed
at
was
the
monopolization
of
supply
by
voluntary
membership
of
the
farmer
members.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
being
a
cooperative
--
mr.
philip
elman
and,
to
some
extent
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
that
unduly
enhances
prices
and
if
does
not
du
--
unduly
enhance
prices,
the
secretary
--
even
the
secretary
can't
act,
so
that
the
--
what
you're
being
asked
to
hold
really
is
that
the
grant
of
power
under
section
2
to
prevent
high
prices
is,
in
effect,
an
immunity
against
restraints
and
monopolization
which
don't
--
don't
--
may
not
increase
prices
and
which
deprives
everybody
who
was
hurt
by
those
violations
of
any
effective
remedy
other
than
section
2.
thank
you
very
much.
