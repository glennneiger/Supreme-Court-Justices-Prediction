since
1924,
you
had
combined
with
embassy
and
fixed
the
price

milk.
justice

well,
suppose
you
had
to
combine
with
another
cooperative,
could
you
do
that?
justice

l.
black
unless
you
could
make
agreement

most
cooperative
could
make
agreements
between
themselves.

you
may
have

suppose
you
made
that
same
agreement
which
you
made
with
baltimore
cooperative
is
the
same.

perhaps
it

apply
for
what?

is
that
their
official
action?
justice

where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
if
he
had
the
power,
did
you
--
are
you
leaving
your
question,
the
first
ground
on
which
the
judge
holtzoff
rested?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not,
what
i
was
thinking
was
if
--
if
he
had
the
power
to
do
it,
it
would
be
the
same
as
though
he
had
approved
it,
would
it
not,
so
far
as
the
violation
of
the
act
was
decided,
if
he
had
the
power
to
approve
the
acquisition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
you
denied
that
he
had
the
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
with
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
asking
you
the
question
with
the
idea
that
how
you
had
to
defend
on
your
first
point
that
he
didn't
have
the
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
congress
confided
the
power
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
pass
on
these
things,
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
proper
to
test
it
out
through
a
violation
and
only
charge
him
for
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
may
be
that
--
i
certainly
haven't
made
my
idea
clear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
--
no,
i
think
it's
fine.
there
are
two
arguments
that
he
made
and
i
understand
you're
making.
the
first
one,
i
think,
is
wholly
a
complete
defense
if
you're
right
that
he
has
no
power
to
authorize
this
to
be
done.
but,
if
that
power
has
been
given,
might
it
not
be
construed
as
to
mean
that
that
was
the
regulatory
method
that
was
to
control
the
acquisition
of
the
dairy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
deny,
do
you
not,
that
he
had
the
power
under
the
capper-volstead
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
authorize
this
acquisition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
was
it
coming
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
disarrange
your
argument.
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
does
your
argument,
the
contention
which
you
made,
result
in
subjecting
cooperatives
to
the
antitrust
act
upon
the
conditions
by
a
labor
union
who
were
held
exempted
in
the
hutcheson
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
includes
(inaudible)
the
charge
on
page
42
that
it
threatened
and
induced
a
boycott
of
the
man
who
sold
feed
and
farm
supply?
justice

have
they
also
intended
in
that
to
prevent
the
boycotts

people

let's
suppose
your

decided
they
didn't
like

and
all
of
them
were

wrote
letters
out
to
all
their
friends
not
to
buy
any
goods
from
you.
you
would
say
they
had
a
right
to
do
that?
that
seems
to
be
what
this
charge
is.
i
don't
say
that
it's
fact.
that
seems
to
be
what
the
charge
is.
