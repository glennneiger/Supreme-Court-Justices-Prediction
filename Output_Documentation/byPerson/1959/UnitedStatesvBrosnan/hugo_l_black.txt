justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
that
the
bond
--
that
the
mortgagee
don't
rise
to
go
into
court,
confess
a
judgment
in
favor
of
himself
and
against
the
mortgagor
without
knowing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
know
it,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
bond
in
the
record
of
the
judgment,
state
court
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
contain
a
attorney's
fee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
what
to
do
under
that,
i
think
i
used
to
know
about
it
in
alabama,
a
small
loan
company.
what
you
do,
you
take
a
note
authorizes
the
--
it's
not
--
the
person
is
(inaudible)
if
it's
not
paid
to
go
into
court,
file
a
suit
against
the
first
(inaudible)
confess
judgment
for
that
person
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
any
notice.
if
it
provides
an
attorney's
fee,
it
included
attorney's
fee
without
the
(inaudible)
and
what
you
did
here
was
the
mortgagee
on
the
bottom
of
the
one
end,
test
the
judgment
without
notifying
anybody,
it
got
a
judgment
for
how
much?
$60,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
$90,000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
--
what
was
the
amount
of
the
bond?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
--
if
that's
a
valid
judgment,
how
could
anyone
attack
it
if
it's
confessed
by
the
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
where
is
that
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
after
the
judgment
was
obtained?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
sort
of
way
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
judgment,
i
am
talking
about
the
judgment
for
the
mortgage
for
the
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
government
come
in
and
tax
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
property
sell
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
talking
about
that
sale,
that
--
under
execution
sale.
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
settle
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
how
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
if
the
government
have
to
pay
you
$55,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
amount
of
your
debt,
and
they
say
they
want
to
get
a
hearing
under
7403.
that's
what
it
gets
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
so
that
you
can
resettle
it
and
see
if
it's
a
bona
fide
sale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
--
is
the
theory
of
that
that
it
sold
for
too
little
and
therefore
the
government
is
losing
its
lien?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
lien
holder
who
wants
to
come
in
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
has
never
been
an
adjudication
has
there,
contested
adjudication
of
how
much
it
was
owing?
you
say
they
are
owing
$55,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
in
the
bond,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
in
the
bond?
and
sometimes
bond
is
paid
or
one
thing
or
another,
there
might
be
a
defense
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
there
wasn't
because
there
had
been
no
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
have
(inaudible)
that,
we
have
a
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
he
did
have
a
judgement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
reopen
the
judgment,
would
you
then
remove?
you
made
it
there,
there
in
state
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
reopen,
if
you
havent'
joined
in
the
state
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
get
your
distinction
there
between
you
and
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
my
fault
but
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
--
pardon
me,
but
i
don't
see
the
--
quite
the
difference.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
vague
--
maybe
it's
a
difference
in
the
use
of
the
word,
they're
saying
that
it
extinguished
that
lien
on
this
particular
piece
of
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
the
government
differ
from
that?
i
--
i
don't
gather
that
that's
the
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
used
the
word
extinguished
and
you
read
that
as
meaning
extinguish
the
lien
it
would
have
to
be
nothing
else.
when
in
reality
i
--
i
gather
it
correctly,
they're
saying
it
is
extinguished,
that
lien
is
drawn
so
far
as
that
particular
piece
of
property
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
these
proceedings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
dispute
between
you
about
the
propriety
of
that
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
that's
it
--
might
it
not
be
construed
as
required
--
if
notice
was
required
for
you
to
extinguish
the
lien
whether
you
do
it
by
attempted
foreclosure
or
by
an
action
to
quiet
title?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
this
statute
doesn't
do
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
confess
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
from
the
legislative
history
that
the
--
you
find
that
in
that
part.
in
other
words
if
--
if
they
wanted
to
amend
it
by
giving
them
the
right
to
quiet
title,
it
might
have
wanted
them
to
have
--
do
a
way
with
the
government
lien
by
--
build
a
quiet
title
or
by
foreclosure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
object
to
that
have
failed
to
join,
so
that
the
united
states
would
get
notice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
--
i
--
i
don't
quite
get
why
you
have
to
--
go,
quite
go
that
far
in
inference.
why
did
they
give
opportunity
here
to
bring
a
suit
against
the
government
if
not
in
order
that
there
might
be
someway
the
government
can
get
notice
whatever
title
proceeding
there
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
--
you're
inferring
from
the
fact
that
the
congress
saw
fit
to
give
the
right
to
sue
the
government,
make
them
a
party
of
this
case,
means
that
congress
intended
to
leave
open
to
this
day
the
procedures
whereby
they
could
extinguish
the
lien
without
or
at
least
on
that
company,
without
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
that
–
here
is
what
i
would
have
like
to
have
an
answer
to
--
on
--
as
i
read
this,
it
shows
the
purpose
of
congress
on
its
face
to
get
--
allowed
the
suit
to
be
filed
and
i
would
assume
so
if
they
would
get
notice.
and
of
course
you
could
have
filed
to
build
the
quiet
title
before
this
state
procedure
would
you
say
extinguished
the
lien.
there's
no
reason
you
shouldn't
have
filed
it
before,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
have
a
right
to
take
away
any
defense
the
government
has
after
it's
made
a
party
about
proceedings
of
which
it
never
has
notice
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
accepting
all
that
as
being
an
absolutely
valid
law
as
between
people
and
the
state
of
california,
do
you
challenge
the
power
of
the
government
to
say
that
before
a
lien
--
had
its
liens
of
the
(inaudible)
that
it
must
be
given
notice
by
being
made
a
party
to
an
action
either
to
quiet
title
or
foreclosure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
that
these
are
all
fixed
in
the
state
laws.
the
government
we
will
assume
now
has
(inaudible)
saying
before
you
take
away
our
right
under
that
state
law,
you
must
make
us
a
party.
do
you
challenge
its
power,
constitutional
power
of
congress
pass
such
a
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
not
a
part
of
this
suit
are
they?
you
only
represent
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
--
i
think
that
you
declared
that
as
a
--
did
that
sound
like
you
are
saying
that
if
you
win
this
lawsuit,
the
bank
is
going
to
lose
money
and
can't
collect
its
mortgage
and
debt,
you
don't
mean
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
mean
as
i
understand
is
that
the
government
is
that
you're
right
on
the
statute,
it
authorizes
a
suit
to
quiet
title,
you
say
that
they're
authorized
to
file
that
the
procedure
that
in
the
merits
they
shouldn't
win
because
that
you
interpret
the
federal
statute,
they
can't
take
away
the
government's
right
without
a
notice,
by
making
it
a
party
to
a
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so
if
you
get
it
back
and
nobody
else
try
to
litigate
but
you
and
them
that
you
--
that
you're
engaged,
you
said
a
while
ago
that
you
have
no
interest
in
them
–
(inaudible).
what
you
want
is
a
chance
to
see
whether
or
not
the
government
has
been
injured
by
having
it
foreclosed
without
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
you
say
the
statute
requires.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
there
anything
else
in
it
except
whether
the
statute
requires
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
say
that
by
their
attempting
to
display
surely
and
as
you
say
wrongfully
they
thereby
forfeited
their
mortgage
or
any
part
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
practically
speaking
from
the
government
standpoint
or
any
other
there
are
many
instances
in
which
foreclosure
sails
ahead
rather
just
bring
totally
and
completely
inadequate
amount
and
that
if
it's
sold
for
what
they
were
worth
they
would
pay
off
the
mortgage
and
pay
off
the
other
liens
and
you
are
claiming
that
the
federal
statute
provides
that
you
should
be
given
notice
in
order
to
protect
your
right
that
you
may
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
in
effect
that
2410
means
if
they
can't
take
away
the
government's
title
to
that
lien
without
notice
to
the
government
making
it
a
party
under
2410?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
else
they
can
do
if
they
can't
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i
think
understand
what
you
mean.
what
you
are
saying
is
that
they
--
they
do
have
a
right
to
file
a
bill
to
quiet
title
which
means
that
if
they
can
win
if
it
means
you
have
no
longer
in
a
lien
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
merits.
you
say
on
the
merits,
you
still
have
a
lien
because
they
didn't
give
you
the
note
--
make
you
a
party
as
the
statute
required
and
therefore
they
lose
their
suit
to
quiet
title
on
the
merits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
because
they're
not
authorized
to
file
a
suit,
isn't
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
you
say
you
have
to
foreclose
the
statute
which
specifically
authorizes
you
to
file
a
bill
to
quiet
title?
you
don't
have
to
wait
until
you
have
sold
it
without
notice.
you
can
file
a
bill
to
quiet
title
and
give
--
give
a
notice
to
the
government
and
test
out
its
lien.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you're
saying
that
they
didn't
have
any
remedy
and
then
they
give
them
a
remedy
to
foreclose
then
they
gave
them
foreclose,
but
they
had
to
have
the
title
(inaudible)
then
they
give
him
a
remedy
by
quieting
title
and
now
you
say
that
despite
those
things
although
they
never
had
any
before
you
can
take
the
third
remedy
and
let
the
state
foreclose
without
notice,
under
the
state
law.
that's
the
same
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
that
they
have
given
you
here
in
this
statute
where
you
did
have
a
right
to
proceed
by
foreclosing,
if
they
wanted
to
add
to
that
so
that
you'd
have
another
remedy,
it's
a
federally
created
remedy
to
quiet
title
that
this
is
in
fact
attacking
this
lien.
i
--
i've
had
those
kind
of
cases.
i
don't
see
why
you
say
that's
not
a
legitimate
kind
of
a
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
7024?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
read
--
as
l
read
the
statute
your
issues
here
i
thought
(inaudible)
a
very
simple
one
as
mr.
justice
franckfruter
suggests
that
this
statute
to
provide
that
the
government
liens
are
not
be
destroyed
without
making
it
a
party,
it
means
some
kind
of
litigation.
it
is
not
the
only
issue
under
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
maybe
you're
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
if
you're
not
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
the
kind
of
litigation
that
doesn't
require
notice
to
the
government
to
make
them
a
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
--
if
the
statute
means
that
the
government's
lien
shall
not
be
destroyed
without
making
it
a
party,
then
you
have
violated
the
statute,
haven't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
don't
say
which
--
