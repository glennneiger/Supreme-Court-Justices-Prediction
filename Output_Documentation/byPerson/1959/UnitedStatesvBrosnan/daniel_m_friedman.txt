mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
and
the
case
which
immediately
follows
it
bring
before
this
court
the
questions
whether
a
government
tax
lien,
which
is
admittedly
junior
to
a
previous
mortgage
on
real
property,
may
be
divested
from
that
real
property,
when
the
mortgagee
follows
state
foreclosure
proceedings
to
which
the
united
states
has
not
been
made
a
party.
in
each
of
these
cases,
what
happened
briefly
was
that
a
mortgage
was
given
subsequently
federal
tax
lien
is
attached
to
the
property.
in
this
case,
the
mortgage
was
foreclosed
under
state
procedures
pursuant
to
a
power
of
mortgagee
to
confess
judgment
and
in
the
next
case
pursuant
to
power
of
state.
it
is
conceded
in
each
case
that
in
carrying
out
the
foreclosure,
the
mortgagee
fully
complied
with
the
provisions
and
requirements
of
state
law.
and
then
under
state
law,
the
effect
of
this
foreclosure
would
be
to
eliminate
private
junior
liens
that
had
attached
to
the
property.
the
government's
position
simply
stated
in
these
cases
is
that
whatever
maybe
the
effect
of
this
procedure
on
the
elimination
of
private
liens,
it
cannot
operate
to
eliminate
the
federal
tax
lien
that
is
attached
to
the
property.
i
want
to
emphasize
here
that
this
case
has
presented
no
question
with
respect
to
priorities
of
liens.
this
is
not
a
conflict
basically
between
the
government
and
other
groups
as
to
which
lien
has
priority.
the
government
concedes
in
these
cases
that
it
has
no
claim
against
this
property
unless
and
until
the
prior
mortgage
has
been
fully
satisfied.
our
claim
basically
is
that
when
the
prior
mortgage
is
fully
satisfied,
we
are
entitled
to
satisfy
our
tax
claim
out
of
any
excess
that
maybe
produced
over
and
above
the
amount
of
the
first
mortgage
and
as
i
will
develop,
the
congress
has
provided
certain
specified
procedures
designed
to
ensure
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
does
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
i
understand
not
under
pennsylvania
law,
under
california
law
in
the
next
case,
there
will
be,
there
is.
now,
i
will
refer
briefly
in
my
argument
of
three
rather
detail
provisions
relating
to
the
elimination
of
tax
liens,
and
i
would
like
to
just
summarize
it
at
the
outset.
the
first
provision
in
section
7403
of
the
internal
revenue
code
1954,
under
which
the
instant
case
was
brought,
and
this
basically
authorizes
the
united
states
to
file
a
preceding
to
foreclose
the
tax
lien
with
respect
to
real
personal
property.
in
addition
to
that,
another
provision
is
section
7424
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
now
that
is
a
simple
matter,
it
gives
someone
who
holds
a
prior
lien
prior
to
that
of
the
united
states
or
someone
who
purchases
at
a
sale
to
foreclose
that
lien
the
right
to
institute
himself
a
suit
to
determine
the
interest
in
the
real
property
after
going
through
a
request
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
that
has
to
request
to
institute
the
other
type
of
suit,
and
it's
denied.
the
last
provision
is
section
2410
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
that
is
a
provision
which
authorizes
the
institution
--
i
am
sorry,
authorizes
the
united
states
to
be
made
a
party
to
a
proceeding
to
foreclose
on
mortgage
or
the
client
title.
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
something
very
significant.
now
that
is
the
only
one
of
these
provisions
which
specifically
provides
that
if
the
provisions
there
and
are
followed
the
effect
of
foreclosure
on
junior
and
subsidiary
liens
is
the
same
as
under
state
law.
in
that
one
case,
congress
has
said
that
if
you
comply
with
these
procedures,
you
look
to
state
law
to
see
what
the
effect
of
foreclosure
is.
but
in
that
situation
where
state
law
wipes
out
the
lien,
it
does,
the
united
states
is
given
a
year
within
which
to
redeem.
now,
the
basic
facts
in
this
case
are
not
disputed
and
are
relative
simple.
in
1948,
some
people
in
apartment
purchased
some
real
property
and
gave
that
a
bond
and
mortgage.
the
bond
on
defendants
laying
a
practice
is
the
equivalent
of
a
promise
to
pay.
the
bond
and
mortgage
were
properly
recorded
and
the
bond
authorized
the
mortgagee
to
enter
a
confession
of
judgment.
after
that
time,
the
various
federal
tax
liens
attached
to
this
property
and
the
tax
liens
were
properly
recorded.
in
1955,
there
was
a
default
under
the
bond,
and
on
june
7th
of
1955,
a
surviving
mortgagee
entered
a
confession
of
judgment
in
accordance
with
the
authority
under
the
bond
and
mortgage.
at
that
point,
they
filed
the
pennsylvania
practice
of
issuing
a
writ
to
the
sheriff
to
sell
the
property.
but,
proceedings
would
delay
while
they
procure
it
from
the
state
court
a
rule
to
show
cause
why
the
united
states
should
not
be
made
a
party
to
these
proceedings.
the
united
states
did
not
answer
this
rule,
and
thereafter,
the
pennsylvania
state
court
issued
an
order
purporting
to
make
the
united
states
a
party
to
the
proceedings.
i
say
purporting
because
the
district
court
subsequently
held
that
that
attempt
to
make
the
united
states
a
party
had
failed
because
it
have
been
begun
too
late.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
served
upon
the
united
states
attorney
and
the
attorney
general
in
accordance
with
the
provision
of
section
2410.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
united
states
did
not
answer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
mr.
justice,
i
think
on
the
theory
which
the
court
held
--
below
held
that
the
proceeding
permits
the
united
states
only
to
be
made
a
party
to
a
proceeding
to
foreclose
a
mortgage.
and
then
in
this
case,
the
judgment
had
already
been
entered.
the
confession
of
judgment
had
been
entered
and
as
the
district
court
held,
they
merely
intended
to
make
us
a
party
to
a
proceeding
in
execution
of
the
foreclosure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suppose
a
better
practice
would
be
to
indicate
why,
but
i
think
there
are
instances
where
it
was
taken
that
since
it
is
improper,
we
do
not
have
to
respond,
and
responding
might,
in
some
way,
be
construed
as
a
recognition
i
suppose
to
the
litigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
during
the
course
of
this
proceeding,
the
respondents
before
this
court
purchased
the
confessed
judgment
and
the
bond
in
mortgage.
and
early
in
1956,
the
property
was
sold
at
a
sheriff's
sale
and
the
respondents
brosnan
and
jacobs
who
had
previously
purchased
the
mortgage,
board
in
the
property
for
slightly
better
than
$6,000,
the
amount
of
the
original
bond
and
mortgage
was
$45,000.
one
year
later,
the
government
attempted
to
redeem
the
property
by
making
a
tender
to
one
of
the
respondents.
this
tender
was
rejected
as
inadequate
in
amount
and
the
district
court
upheld
that
ruling
that
the
tender
was
improperly
rejected
and
the
issue
is
no
longer
in
the
case,
because
the
government
abandoned
that
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
not
pressing
it
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
argument
that
we
made
a
proper
tender
under
the
statute
when
we
attempted
to
redeem
the
property.
we're
no
longer
contending
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
we
will
rest
here
solely
on
the
basic
question
whether
the
effect
of
the
state
court
proceeding
eliminated
the
federal
lien
on
the
real
property.
now,
the
instant
suit
was
filed
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
mortgage
had
been
foreclosed
under
this
provision
of
section
7403
of
the
code
which
i
referred.
it
sought
an
adjudication
from
the
district
court
first
that
the
united
states
had
not
properly
been
made
a
party
to
the
state
court
proceeding.
secondly
that
the
federal
lien
remains
an
encumbrance
on
the
property.
third,
it
requested
the
court
to
determine
the
relative
priorities
to
the
property.
and
finally,
to
have
the
marshal
sell
of
property
and
to
distributed
the
proceeds
in
accordance
to
these
priorities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
mortgage
redemption
or
the
other?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no,
we
argued
only
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
only
the
issue,
which
we
are
arguing
before
this
court
now.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
the
district
court
denied
the
government
all
relief.
first,
it
held
that
the
united
states
had
not
properly
been
made
a
party
to
the
proceedings
under
2410.
it
stated
that
to
properly
invoke
section
2410,
the
united
states
must
be
named
initially
as
a
the
defendant
in
the
state
court
action,
and
that
all
was
done
here
was
an
attempt
to
make
the
united
states
a
party
to
the
execution
of
the
judgment
that
had
already
been
entered.
at
the
time,
this
ordered
to
show
cause
was
issued
and
the
united
states
was
purportedly
made
a
party
but
the
judgment
already
been
entered
several
months
before.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
but
i
would
rarely
doubt
it
since
the
confession
of
judgement
which
--
mr.
justice,
i
understand
on
pennsylvania
practice
entered
as
a
matter
of
form
once
there
is
a
power
to
confess
judgment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
i
think
mr.
justice
that
congress
in
setting
up
this
statute
2410,
which
provides
that
if
you
follow
the
procedures,
the
united
states
lien
maybe
cut
off
under
state
procedures
specified
certain
things
to
be
done.
one
of
which
is
that
the
united
states
must
be
made
a
party
to
a
suit
to
foreclose.
now,
if
we
had
been
made
a
party
to
begin
with,
we
might
have
had
some
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
mortgage.
and
secondly,
and
i
think
more
significant,
if
you
we
were
made
a
party
initially,
we
would
have
the
full
opportunity
to
contest
all
aspects
of
the
case.
but
as
in
this
situation,
the
state
just
goes
ahead
and
follows
its
own
procedures.
if
the
decision
below
in
this
case
is
correct,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
we
had
or
hadn't
been
given
notice,
because
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
as
i
read
the
decision,
is
that
as
long
as
state
practice
does
not
require
a
junior
lienor
to
be
made
a
party
before
the
lien
is
cut
off,
united
states
stands
in
the
same
position.
and
i
believe
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
generally
speaking,
what
would
happen
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
as
long
as
the
provisions
of
congress
had
provided,
we
are
not
complied
with.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
are
not
suggesting
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
so,
we
might
have
a
right
to
question
the
validity
of
the
prior
lien.
that's
all
i
am
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
any
of
those
factors
whether
the
lien
was
fully
perfected
other
than
mortgage
liens
and
so
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suppose
the
government
probably
could
have
waived.
but
the
problem
is
mr.
justice
that
we
don't
think
that
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
anyhow
which
would
have
given
us
the
right
to
redemption,
because
the
statute,
we
think,
speaks
in
terms
of
judicial
sale.
and
we
think
what
is
contemplated
under
2410
that
we
have
the
right
--
our
right
to
--
let
me
--
under
2410,
our
lien
maybe
cut
off
in
accordance
with
state
procedures
only
if
there
is
foreclosure
at
a
judicial
sale.
and
then
the
protection
that
government
is
giving
in
that
case
is,
the
lien
is
cut
off
but
we
have
the
right
to
redeem.
now,
we
think
that
the
judicial
sale
contemplates
something
quite
different
than
what
was
had
in
this
case.
this
means,
we
think
it
means
a
sale
pursuant
to
court
order
with
an
opportunity
to
object
to
the
terms
of
the
sales
and
so
on.
so
that's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
we
think
not
mr.
justice.
there's
another
proceeding
under
pennsylvania
practice
which
the
district
court
referred
to
under
which
foreclosure
started
by
--
without
any
entry
of
confession
of
judgment.
in
other
words,
we
think
that's
the
kind
of
proceeding
which
started
with
a
complaint,
whereas
here
--
what
you
have
here
is
just
a
judgment
is
entered
and
the
next
step
is
--
is
a
sale
by
the
sheriff.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
the
congress
had
referenced
to
when
it
spoke
of
judicial
sale.
but,
if
--
i
might
just
refer
to
the
finding
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
in
holding
that
the
federal
lien
was
cut
off
by
the
state
proceedings,
the
court
recognized
that
in
pennsylvania
a
mortgage
creates
only
a
lien
and
not
in
the
state.
and
it
also
found
that
the
government
lien
fastened
upon
a
title
to
real
property.
so,
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
under
local
law,
the
mortgage
interest
here
is
that
solely
of
creating
a
security
interest
in
favor
of
the
mortgagee.
the
mortgagor
retained
the
title
of
the
property
at
all
times.
now,
the
district
court
however
held
that
the
state
proceedings
had
the
effect
or
eliminating
the
federal
lien
on
the
real
property,
and
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
the
third
circuit
held,
in
effect,
as
follows.
it
said
that
since
under
pennsylvania
law,
the
purchase
toward
a
sheriff's
sale
takes
the
same
title
as
the
debtor
had
prior
to
this
execution,
and
since
further
under
pennsylvania
law,
the
--
lien
the
--
execution
relates
back
to
the
time
when
the
mortgage
was
given.
this
meant
that
once
the
execution
had
taken
place,
the
government
had
no
interest
in
the
property
at
all.
it
goes
back,
it
cuts
off
the
mortgagor's
interest
and
therefore,
the
united
states
had
no
remain
--
no
interest
to
--
there
was
no
interest
to
the
mortgagor
to
which
the
government
lien
for
the
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
vary
from
state
to
state.
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
this
mr.
justice
that
in
the
first
instance,
you
have
to
look
at
the
state
law
if
you
see
if
there
was
any
interest
in
the
mortgagor
which
remained
after
the
mortgage
had
been
given.
that
was
--
was
there
some
interest
to
which
the
federal
lien
could
attach.
to
start,
i
think
there
has
to
be
something
to
which
the
federal
lien
attaches
it
after
the
mortgage
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right,
but
once
we
overcome
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
might,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
i
think
also
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
if
that
were
all
that
were
involved,
the
government
would
have
not
brought
this
case
here.
i
think
that
in
most
states
at
least,
today
and
mortgages
generally
is
only
a
security
interest,
and
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
as
long
as
the
mortgagor
retains
the
property
interest,
as
long
as
it's
secured
--
the
mortgage
is
given
only
a
security
for
a
debt.
when
that
happens,
the
federal
tax
lien
attaches
to
that
interest.
in
other
words,
here,
you
have
a
property
subject
to
a
security
lien.
and
in
effect,
what
has
happened
is
really
the
mortgagor
has
said
to
the
mortgagee,
“i
am
going
to
give
you
the
right
to
sell
this
property
if
i
don't
pay
my
debts,
and
you
may
then
apply
the
proceeds
to
the
payment
of
my
indebtedness
to
you.”
now,
the
state
of
course
may
and
properly
does
determine
what
the
effect
of
that
kind
of
proceeding
that
sale
the
property
to
satisfy
the
interceding
debt.
what
effect
this
has
on
the
junior
lien
that
it
creates?
but
we
believe
that
the
state
cannot
purport
to
say
that
because
state
interest
has
cut
off
to
this
proceeding,
the
federal
interest
similarly
can
be
cut
off
in
situation
where
the
united
state
has
not
been
made
a
party.
now,
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
various
provisions
which
congress
has
enacted
dealing
with
this
difficult
subject
of
federal
liens.
to
begin
with,
congress
itself
has
provided
the
duration
of
the
liens.
the
statute
says
that
unless
another
day
the
specifically
fix
by
law
of
the
tax
lien
arises
when
the
assessment
is
made
and
it
continues
either
until
the
liability
for
the
tax
is
satisfied
or
becomes
unenforceable
by
reason
of
lapse
in
time.
then,
the
united
states
has
given
the
power
under
section
7403
itself
to
bring
a
suit
to
foreclose
its
lien
and
to
have
all
the
interest
in
the
property
determined.
there's
another
provision,
section
6325
of
the
code
which
provides
for
the
administrative
release
of
liens
in
a
situation
where
as
a
practical
matter,
the
government's
lien
has
no
value
and
application
maybe
made
for
administrative
discharge,
and
even
the
whole
lien
can
be
discharged
or
the
lien
maybe
released
from
specific
property.
and
finally,
there's
this
general
statute,
section
2410,
which
permits
the
united
states
to
be
made
a
party
to
any
civil
action
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
a
state
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
to
prior
title
or
to
foreclose
a
mortgage
or
other
lien
on
real
or
personal
property.
and
in
discussing
this
section,
one
other
point
should
be
mentioned
is
that
under
this
section,
not
only
are
there
various
provisions
provided
for
the
protection
of
the
united
states,
such
as
the
lien
of
the
government
must
be
described
by
particularity,
appropriate
notice
and
so
on,
the
government
is
also
giving
the
right
to
remove
the
case
to
the
federal
district
court.
and
i
want
to
reiterate
again
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
2410,
well,
he
has
a
choice,
he
could
do
that.
well,
the
first
instance
he
may
speak
administrative
discharge
of
the
federal
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then,
he
has
a
choice
of
either
bringing
a
proceeding
under
2410
or
a
fall
in
this,
somewhat
more
cumbersome
proceeding
under
section
7424
in
which
he
in
effect
asked
the
government
to
bring
a
foreclosure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
and
we
think
that
is
what
--
that
is
precisely
what
congress
intended
that
federal
liens
are
not
to
be
discharged
to
leave
many
different
and
varying
state
court
procedure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
because
the
tax
lien
statute
speaks
in
very
broad
term.
in
this
--
in
this
very
case,
there
are
all
sorts
of
taxes
involved,
they're
unemployed
--
federal
unemployment
insurance
taxes,
old
age
assistance
tax
as
well
as
income
tax.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
that
the
congress
recognized
the
far
reaching
effect
of
this
because
it
specifically
provided
that
this
is
the
one
instance,
2410,
when
you
may
look
to
the
state
law
to
determine
what
the
effect
is
of
the
state
foreclosure
proceedings
on
the
federal
law.
and
i
--
as
i
say,
i
think
that
it's
congress
which
has
created
this
liens
and
it's
congress
and
not
the
state
which
are
to
be
determined
how
they
are
to
be
removed,
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
2410
was
originally
enacted
in
1931
and
it
was
amended
in
1942
to
add
the
provision
permitting
the
bringing
of
a
quiet
title
suit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
am
not
clear
as
to
your
question
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
have,
as
my
understanding
is
we
have
insisted
on
that,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
you
must
comply
strictly
with
these
provisions
in
order
to
have
the
effect
of
discharge
in
the
lien.
there's
been
some
litigation
--
in
many
cases
involving
peripheral
points
and
there
two
previous
court
of
appeals
decision
in
addition
to
these
two
case
which
have
gone
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
could
fairly
make
that
statement
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
the
statement
is
that
generally
speaking,
it's
recognized
that
it
is
necessary
to
join
the
government,
because
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
these
provisions
itself
shows
that
these
provisions,
the
provision
originally
in
section
7424
and
then
this
provision
section
2410
were
enacted
because
of
the
various
real-estate
interest
that
complaint,
there
was
no
way
they
could
get
rid
of
this
government
lien.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
government
lien,
you
had
a
prior
mortgage
and
there
was
no
way
to
get
rid
of
it
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
these
things.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
wouldn't
think
this
so
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
all
i
can
say
mr.
chief
justice
is
i
would
think
so,
i
can't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
state
that
affirmatively
but
i'd
say
they
were
the
leaders
in
urging
this
legislation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
prior
to
1931,
originally
in
1924,
they
had
passed
these
two
provisions
giving
the
united
states
the
right
to
foreclose
its
lien
and
also
giving
a
person
--
who
had
--
an
interest
in
real
property
the
right
to
--
himself
go
under
the
district
court
but
1931
was
the
first
time
that
this
provision
permitting
the
united
states
to
be
made
a
party
to
a
mortgage
foreclosure
suit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
didn't.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
as
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
--
the
united
states
did
have
this
precise
liens
and
the
--
as
i
understand
that
prior
to
that
time,
there
was
no
way
that
the
government's
lien
could
be
wiped
out
except
--
in
other
words,
a
mortgage
would
be
foreclosed
and
there
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
because
the
legislative
history
states
that
there
was
no
way
in
which
these
liens
could
be
wiped
or
should
pay
them
off,
and
that
--
that
was
the
complaint
of
the
--
the
lien
was
worth
perhaps.
the
value
of
the
property
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
mr.
justice
that
the
need
to
bring
the
government
in,
we
think
rest
not
only
on
the
fact
that
under
state
practice
in
many
instances,
the
junior
lienor
must
be
brought
in
but
also
on
the
broader
ground
that
the
federal
lien
on
the
property
gives
the
united
states
a
property
interest.
the
united
states
has
an
interest
in
the
property
and
under
settled
principles,
the
united
states
must
be
made
a
party
to
any
suit
involving
property
in
which
it
has
an
interest.
i'd
like
to
read,
refer
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
unless
the
state
procedures
specify
--
comply
with
the
requirements
if
2410
or
these
other
provisions,
they're
not
operative
to
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there's
nothing
that
it
--
it
can
do
except
that
--
if
the
new
jersey
legislature
provides
a
provision,
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument,
the
new
jersey
legislature
provided
a
provision
for
foreclosure
and
said
that
the
lien
of
the
united
states
maybe
eliminated
upon
giving
10
days
notice
to
the
attorney
general.
and
the
congressional
statute
says
60
days
notice,
i
don't
think
the
new
jersey
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
then
it
would
be
--
then
it
would
be
--
then
2410
would
be
net,
and
then
they
would
be
complying
with
2410.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
state
from
adopting
a
procedure
which
fully
complies
with
the
requirements
of
the
federal
procedure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
2410
explicitly
so
provides
subject
to
the
right
of
redemption
of
course
which
is
very
important
and
subject
to
the
further
fact
that
the
united
states
has
given
the
right
to
remove
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
the
right
to
remove
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
that's
at
the
very
beginning
of
2410
on
page
33
of
our
brief
under
subsection
(a)
under
the
conditions
prescribed
and
section
1444
of
this
title
which
is
the
provision
for
removal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
believe
explicitly
in
those
terms.
i
don't
believe
that
states
attempted
to
make
their
law
to
meet
the
standards
of
the
federal,
but
our
point
is
that
you
can't
--
you
can't
comply
with
these
federal
things,
and
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
state
prescribing
a
form
of
procedure.
indeed,
in
this
very
case
we
think
that
if
the
other
procedure
which
pennsylvania
will
allows,
the
initiation
of
a
complaint
prior
to
the
entry
of
a
--
the
flow
of
judgment
and
the
giving
of
notice
in
the
foreclosure
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
court
that
that
would
meet
the
standards
of
2410.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
i
think
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
the
question
as
to
the
effect
we
think
of
cutting
off
federal
liens
must
depend
on
the
congressional
provisions
relating
to
such
liens.
now,
new
jersey
can
of
course
adopt
whatever
procedures
it
wishes.
new
jersey
can
adopt
whatever
procedures
it
wishes
to
discharge
private
liens.
and
all
that
i
was
suggesting
is
that
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
new
jersey
from
adopting
a
procedure
which
will
satisfy
the
standards
of
2410,
and
thus
by
complying
with
it,
have
the
effect
which
congress
has
permitted
under
2410.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
specifically
under
the
1440.
that's
one
of
the
rights
that
congress
gave
for
the
protection
of
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
because
that
is
what
congress
has
provided
in
the
case
of
federal
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
yes.
the
united
states
would
have
the
right
to
remove.
that's
given
explicitly.
now,
i
think
this
discussion
has
also
pointed
up
the
fact
that
there's
a
real
and
serious
danger
here
of
conflict
between
the
federal
procedures
and
program
for
the
discharge
of
liens
on
the
one
hand
and
the
state
proceedings
on
the
other.
one
instance
that's
already
been
developed
here
in
many
states
including
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
a
junior
lien
maybe
discharged
without
making
the
junior
lienor
a
party.
but
under
the
various
federal
statutes,
the
united
states
must
be
made
a
party
to
any
proceedings
seeking
to
discharge
its
lien.
and
similarly,
there
are
various
conflicts
dealing
with
the
right
of
redemption.
here,
the
united
states
has
given
a
year
within
which
to
redeem.
some
states
attempt
to
give
the
mortgagor
the
exclusive
right
to
redeem.
other
states
provide
a
greater
or
a
lesser
period.
indeed,
we
have
in
this
case
what
i
think
is
the
anomalous
situation.
and
then
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
state
liens
fair
better
than
federal
liens
in
the
foreclosure
proceedings
followed
here,
because
under
pennsylvania
law,
the
state
lien
for
taxes
will
be
discharged
at
a
foreclosure
sale
only
if
they
amount
realize
at
the
foreclosure
sale
is
sufficient
to
pay
off
the
state
liens.
and
in
fact,
in
this
very
case,
the
amount
that
was
bid
at
the
foreclosure
sale
by
the
purchasers
who
were
the,
in
effect,
the
successes
to
the
mortgagees
was
an
amount
sufficient
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
sale
and
pay
off
the
local
taxes.
that
was
what
--
that
was
what
happened.
if
the
local
taxes
were
paid
off
and
yet
at
the
same
time
the
state
procedure
has
the
effect
of
cutting
off
the
federal
lien
in
this
situation
where
the
government
gets
not
a
single
penny,
the
state
is
paid
in
full,
the
united
states
gets
not
a
penny.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
if
it
were
a
mortgage
lien,
it
would
but
this
--
the
statute
says
the
lien
of
all
taxes
now
or
hereafter
to
be
levied.
this
is
page
36
of
our
brief.
against
any
real
estate
within
the
commonwealth
shall
be
divested
by
any
judicial
sales
such
land
provided
the
amount
of
the
purchased
shall
equal
the
amount
of
the
state
taxes.
but
i
was
just
pointing
out
that
the
conflicting
situation
here
if
federal
tax
liens
maybe
eliminated
through
this
bearing
in
different
state
procedures.
now,
congress
has
adopted
as
one
of
its
cardinal
canons
of
taxation
the
idea
of
equality
that
it
should
not
vary
from
state
to
state.
and
we
think
that
what
congress
has
done
in
this
situation
is
to
say
that
there
is
to
be
one
procedure,
the
various
forms
of
it
administrative
discharge,
suit
by
the
government,
suit
requested
after
request
to
the
commissioner
or
proceeding
under
2410,
that
those
are
the
ways
in
which
the
federal
liens
are
to
be
discharged.
and
we
do
not
think
that
congress
ever
intended
in
this
area,
important
area
of
federal
taxation,
to
permit
the
states
by
their
own
procedures
fully
proper
with
respect
to
their
own
local
liens
to
wipe
out
the
federal
tax
lien
in
a
proceeding
where
the
united
states
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we've
said
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
15
to
19.
i
see,
i
can't
point
to
anything
specifically
that
speaks
that
this
being
exclusive
in
that.
but
what
we
do
think
is
that
this
comprehensive
system
has
been
set
up
by
congress
involves
an
occupancy
of
the
field.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
from
the
scheme,
and
as
i
say
the
fact
that
under
2410,
there
is
the
specific
reference
in
one
situation
that
the
validity
of
the
federal
lien
continued
existence
will
be
determined
by
state
law.
in
one
situation
they
say
that
if
you
follow
these
procedures,
the
effect
on
the
junior
lien
is
to
be
the
same
as
that
under
state
law,
and
we
think
that
is
the
only
exception
and
unless
that
is
followed,
the
federal
lien
continues
even
though
under
state
law
the
junior
lien
is
released
from
the
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
and
i
--
as
i
say,
we're
not
attempting
at
this
--
we're
not
arguing
at
that
tender
was
adequate
at
this
point.
but
as
i
say
--
i
say,
since
we're
not
arguing
--
we're
not
claiming
here
that
any
right
to
redeem
any
mortgage.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
we
had
--
first
that
we
probably
would
not
have
prevailed
and
second
that's
the
reason
we
didn't
press
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
my
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suspect
though,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
i
am
--
i
am
not
attempting
to
suggest
here
that
--
there
is
some
indications,
some
--
under
some
of
the
statutes
that
where
a
junior
lienor
redeems,
he
satisfies
the
standard
by
paying
merely
what
was
bid
at
the
foreclosure
sale.
but
as
i
understand
mr.
jacob
states
and
i
am
questioning
the
practice
in
pennsylvania
as
the
first
bid
that
is
made
at
a
foreclosure
is
for
cost
and
local
taxes.
if
there's
another
bid,
it's
then
jump
up
to
$50,000
or
whatever
it
is.
we're
not
attempting
to
argue
here,
so
to
say
that
our
tender
was
valid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just
very,
very
briefly
mr.
chief
justice,
we
didn't
abandon
this
position.
what
happened
was
we
said
that
--
what
have
been
done
here
did
not
operate
to
divest
our
lien
because
we
hadn't
made
a
party
initially.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
had
not
been
made
a
party
to
a
proceeding
to
foreclose
a
mortgage
under
2410.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
precisely
correct
mr.
justice,
because
the
statutes
speaks
in
terms
of
a
proceeding
of
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
to
--
for
the
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage.
and
we
think
as
the
district
court
held
in
this
case
that
that
means
we
must
be
made
a
party
to
that
proceeding
at
the
very
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
ab
initio
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
one
thing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
thing
mr.
chief
justice
is
under
2410,
we
are
given
the
right
of
removal
into
the
federal
court
and
it
seems
to
me
when
we
remove
is
the
suit
for
the
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage.
we
can't
remove
to
the
federal
court
a
proceeding
--
a
sheriff's
sale.
what
is
contemplated
we
think
here
is
a
basic
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
removal
--
what
--
the
only
thing
we
could
remove
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings
would
be
execution
proceeding
and
we
think
what
congress
is
contemplated
here
that
the
--
for
the
protection
of
the
united
states,
it
has
the
right
to
remove
the
whole
thing
to
have
in
the
first
instance
before
any
judgment
has
entered,
which
has
the
effect
and
interest
of
the
united
states
to
have
itself
be
given
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
those
things.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
think
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
had
a
judgement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
whether
if
we
reopen
the
judgment
we
could
remove.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
into
the
state
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
i
would
think
that
the
removal
would
require
initially
before
there's
been
any
final
determination.
i
would
if
i
--
just
like
to
say
one
other
point
which
i
think
is
important.
the
fact
that
we
attempted
to
redeem
a
year
later,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
indicate
that
we
conceded
that
we
had
been
properly
made
a
party
to
the
state
court
proceeding.
and
it
seems
to
be
perfectly
consistent
common
practice
for
litigants
to
try
alternative
remedies.
we
thought
that
we
would
not
--
had
not
been
properly
joined,
but
nevertheless,
we
did
attempt
to
redeem
later
to
protect
ourselves.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
pennsylvania
does
not
permit
redemptions
under
pennsylvania
law.
once
the
sheriff
has
set
sold,
there
is
no
right
of
redemption.
there
is
no
right
of
redemption
under
pennsylvania
law
to
my
understanding
nevertheless.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
advert
to
a
question
which
the
chief
justice
asked
yesterday
and
which
was
reiterated
today
which
is
the
extent
to
which
section
2410
has
been
used
in
situations
where
the
government
claims
a
lien
on
the
property.
and
i've
gotten
some
statistics
together,
they
--
i
cannot
vouch
completely
for
their
accuracy,
they're
obtaining
in
a
hurry,
but
i
think
they
will
demonstrate
quite
clearly
that
the
general
practice
appears
to
be
to
use
section
2410
in
situations
where
in
fact
the
government
does
claim
a
lien
or
an
interest
upon
property.
now
the
cases
are
broken
down
into
two
categories
because
of
the
fact
that
2410
is
not
limited
to
tax
liens.
it
also
covers
other
government
liens
and
the
tax
lien
figures
are
available
from
the
tax
division
and
the
other
lien
figures
from
the
other
divisions
and
they're
both
civil
divisions.
they're
broken
down
some
what.
now
in
the
fiscal
year
1959,
our
statistics
show
that
the
government
was
named
as
a
defendant
in
proceedings
under
section
2410
in
tax
cases,
in
2939
cases.
in
other
words
there
are
almost
3,000
cases
during
the
last
fiscal
year
in
which
in
one
form
or
another
a
suit
was
brought
against
the
government
under
section
2410
either
for
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage
or
to
quiet
title
in
which
the
government
claimed
a
tax
lien
against
the
property
and
a
number
of
those
cases
has
been
ascending
back
in
19
fiscal,
1956
was
1808.
now
i
also
have
some
figures
from
the
civil
division.
of
course
as
i
indicated
in
the
civil
division
cases,
they
entail
not
only
tax
liens
but
a
wide
variety
of
other
government
liens
and
those
figures
show
that
during
fiscal
year
1958,
there
were
737
cases
in
which
the
united
states
was
named
as
a
party
defendant
in
a
proceeding
under
section
2410
either
to
quiet
title,
or
their
foreclosure
and
mortgage.
now
the
majority
of
those
cases
were
cases
which
were
determined
in
the
state
courts.
i
want
to
emphasize
this
that
these
proceedings
do
not
flood
the
federal
courts
because
the
united
states
has
the
right
to
removal
and
then
the
majority
of
cases,
the
right
to
removal
is
not
exercised.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
that
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't,
except
to
say
that's
a
very
small
percentage,
i
will
endeavor
to
obtain
those
figures.
i'm
not
sure
if
they
are
available.
so
that
we
think
this
indicates
clearly
the
large
number
of
this
cases
--
one
--
one
further
figure
that
--
in
the
civil
field,
the
non-tax
field,
since
this
statute
was
first
passed
in
1931,
i
have
a
slight
breakdown
as
to
some
judicial
districts.
for
example
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
district
of
new
jersey,
in
the
civil
field
there
have
been
2758
cases
in
which
suits
were
brought
against
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
those
would
be
in
the
new
jersey
state
court.
there
may
have
been
a
few
that
were
tried
initially
in
the
district
court.
the
vast
majority
have
been
in
the
state
courts.
and
we
think
this
wide-spread
practice
indicates
quite
clearly
the
understanding
both
by
now
is
that
the
bar
and
by
the
real-estate
community
that
if
there
is
a
situation
where
the
government
has
a
tax
lien
on
the
property
or
claims
a
tax
lien,
the
procedure
generally
followed
is
to
proceed
under
2410.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
--
we
have
previously
below
(inaudible)
but
we
now
do
not
question
the
right
of
the
bank
to
maintain
the
quiet
title
acts
and
we
do
not
question
if
this
is
an
appropriate
way
for
the
bank
to
have
determined
whether
or
not
the
government's
lien
was
extinguished
from
this
property
as
a
result
to
the
state
court
proceedings.
our
position
is
basically,
and
if
we
think
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
here
that
the
bank's
title
was
not
quieted.
the
bank
couldn't
quiet
its
title
because
the
theory
on
which
the
bank
filed
was
a
complaint,
why
that
the
previous
state
nonjudicial
sale
had
the
effect
of
wiping
out
the
government's
lien
on
this
property.
that
was
the
theory
and
they
came
in
and
said,
“quiet
the
title
because
the
government's
lien
is
out”
and
as
we
understand
and
it's
our
position,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"no
your
title
is
not
quiet
because
the
government's
lien
is
has
not
been
wiped
out."
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
we
would
mr.
justice
because
we
don't
think
that
the
state
even
though
it
may
quiet
title
with
respect
to
private
entities
and
quiet
title
as
to
the
government.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
precisely
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
is
our
position
that
the
--
the
proceedings
which
were
followed
in
the
california
--
under
the
california
law,
the
sale
of
the
property
under
the
deed
of
trust
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
precisely,
and
therefore,
while
they
can
maintain
this
action
to
have
ascertained
whether
or
not
the
government
lien
had
been
wiped
out
the
fact
is
that
the
government
lien
had
not
been
wiped
because
california
cannot
through
those
procedures
eliminate
the
federal
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
we
--
we
do
differ
with
--
with
respect
to
mr.
stewart
on
one
point
which
is
on
this
question
of
notice.
we
don't
think
that
the
state
can
say
to
the
federal
government,
if
--
if
you
want
to
protect
your
lien
you
have
to
come
in
and
file
a
notice
in
the
state
court.
and
indeed
the
federal
statute
was
recent,
was
specifically
amended
to
make
it
clear
that
the
most
that
the
federal
state
court
could
do
would
be
to
provide
under
section
2410
the
place
where
a
lien
maybe
filed
in
order
that
the
state
could
not
impose
conditions
but
not
state
what
information
is
required
to
be
included
in
the
lien
that
the
government
filed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
that
is
the
general
practice.
the
lien
is
received.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
to
the
statute,
section
6323
of
the
code
which
provides
that
in
the
event
it
has
not
been
recorded,
it's
not
valid
as
against
mortgagees,
pledgees,
purchasers
and
judgment
credit.
the
general
practice
is
to
file
these
liens
and
that
was
done
in
this
case
the
--
at
least
the
two
first
liens
were
filed
approximately
few
months
or
two
after
they
have
been
received
in
the
collector's
office.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
1924.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
it's
--
it's
clear.
the
--
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
reason
for
these
provisions
was
because
there
was
no
other
way
of
dealing
with
this
problem.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
deriving
it,
there
was
no
other
way.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
now
i
would
think
--
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
prior
to
2410,
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
could
do
anything.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
couldn't
touch
the
federal
lien
and
in
2410,
congress
stated
in
one
specific
instance
where
a
proceeding
to
foreclose
is
brought
and
where
there
has
been
a
judicial
sale
at
that
foreclosure
then
the
effect
of
that
sale
upon
the
junior
lien
is
to
be
determined
by
state
law
but
it
does
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
don't
know
that
the
specific
decision
but
we
--
what
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
some
history
here
that
as
early
as
1913
the
american
bar
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
the
--
i
don't
know
of
any
specific
decision
but
at
least
as
far
back
as
1913.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
american
bar
association
urged
that
legislation
should
be
passed
to
permit
the
elimination
of
these
federal
liens.
but
it
was
always
in
the
context
of
eliminating
a
federal
lien
that
was
worthless.
the
very
quotation
from
attorney
general
jackson
that
has
been
read
to
this
court,
spoke
in
terms
of
eliminating
worthless
liens.
this
means
the
situation
where
the
government
has
a
lien
but
for
one
reason
or
other
the
lien
is
not
worth
anything.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
dollars
and
cents
or
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
maybe
more
than
dollars
and
cents.
it
may
be
that
the
tax
is
no
longer
collectible.
the
period
of
the
tax
has
been
voided.
there
are
variety
of
situations
but
the
critical
case
in
all
of
those
situations
is
that
it
was
unfair
that
the
people
having
the
real
interest
in
the
property
that
even
though
the
government's
lien
was
valued
there
was
no
way
they
could
get
rid
of
it.
it
was
a
cloud
on
title
would
hang
over
the
property,
they
couldn't
sell
it.
now
this
is
a
different
situation.
this
is
not
a
situation
were
the
lien
is
worthless
in
the
sense
of
a
tax
can't
be
collected.
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
claim
is
that
the
lien
has
been
wiped
out,
it
has
been
wiped
out
because
of
the
state
proceeding
and
in
that
situation,
we
don't
think
they
can
come
in
and
say,
"quiet
our
title,
quiet
our
title
merely
because
we've
going
through
this
previous
state
proceeding."
it
seems
to
us
the
quiet
title
action
is
a
method
for
testing
the
effect
of
the
state
sale
but
it
is
not
a
means
of
itself
wiping
out
the
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
government
specifically,
and
we
requested
in
an
alternative
that
the
property,
that
its
lien
be
foreclosed
and
that
the
property
be
sold
and
the
proceeds
be
distributed
in
accordance
with
its
lien.
in
other
words
it
will
result,
and
if
a
greater
amount
were
obtained
in
the
amount
of
the
first
mortgage
the
--
that
would
be
paid
off
on
our
lien,
if
nothing
more
where
it
can.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
and
of
course
the
original
proceeding
in
this
case
wasn't
a
court
proceeding
at
all.
all
that
is
done
on
the
california
law
if
you
have
a
power
of
sale
under
a
deed
of
trust
is
to
file
a
notice
in
the
recorder's
office
indicating
that
there
has
been
a
default
and
after
90
days
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
it
would
have
been
more
likely
we
might
have
brought
a
proceeding
in
the
federal
court
under
7403
to
foreclose
our
lien.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
first
notice
we
had
of
this
proceeding
was
when
we
were
served
in
the
quiet
title
action
with
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
have
assumed
that
we
would
have
done
that
rather
than
going
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
might
have,
yes.
i
--
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
what
we
would
have
done
in
that
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
county
clerks
with
the
county
clerk
records
for
the
(inaudible)

daniel

friedman
90
days.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
we
would
have
had
to
initiate
it
as
mr.
stewart
said
we
would
have
had
to
bring
to
suit
to
enjoin
the
sale
or
something.
this
is
--
this
is
the
proceeding
merely
to
give
notice
and
i
take
it
basically
to
give
the
people
an
opportunity
to
bid
on
this
property.
and
i
might
mention
that
the
united
states,
if
we
have
been
given
notice
in
this
situation
we
have
no
power
to
bid
in
this
kind
of
a
foreclosure
sale
in
that
situation
where
foreclosure
is
sought
by
other
party.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice,
i
think
if
we
prevail
in
this
action
the
complaint
to
quiet
title
would
be
dismissed.
there
were
--
there
were
of
course
motions
for
summary
judgment.
i
think
if
we
prevail
in
this
action
what
happens
is
that
the
bank
now
owns
the
property
subject
to
our
tax
lien
and
at
this
point
whatever
further
proceedings
are
appropriate
may
be
taken.
we
may
initiate
the
proceeding.
they
may
wish
to
initiate
a
further
proceeding
under
section
7424.
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
because
at
the
time
of
the
foreclosure
the
interest
which
the
bank
had
has
already
with
the
bank
received
was
already
encumbered
by
this
federal
lien,
junior
admittedly
to
the
bank
claim,
but
nonetheless
a
valid
lien.
and
that
i'd
like
to
repeat
what
i
said
yesterday
emphasizing
this
situation,
all
we're
contending
for
is
that
we
want
an
opportunity
to
protect
our
rights
so
that
if
--
if
in
fact
this
property
is
worth
more
than
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
we
will
have
the
right
to
apply
the
excess
to
our
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
bank's
first
lien
would
be
satisfied,
but
that
would
not
eliminate,
we
don't
think
the
federal
lien
on
the
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it
would
get
whatever
the
property
is
worth
over
the
first
or
second
lien
in
the
--
in
the
same
way
that
in
any
situation
i
think
if
there
is
a
first
lien
which
is
foreclosed
and
it's
subject
to
a
prior
lien.
in
other
words
as
far
as
the
bank
is
concerned
what
it
received
at
the
time
of
this
foreclosure,
it
took
subject
to
the
government's
lien
because
the
state
while
it
may
create
the
interest
in
the
bank
when
it
creates
the
junior
lien
and
it
says
how
they
can
be
eliminated,
we
don't
think
the
state
has
the
power
to
say
that
a
federal
lien
created
by
an
act
of
congress
can
be
eliminated
from
real
property
merely
because
you
follow
certain
state
procedure.
in
other
words
congress
has
decided
the
way
in
which
federal
liens
maybe
released
from
real
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
no
if
there
--
if
there
were
another
foreclosure
and
the
property
is
worth
only
$15,000.00
that
would
wipe
our
lien
out.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
furthermore,
if
the
property
were
worth
only
$15,000.00
and
owes
the
$25,000.00
debt,
i'd
feel
certain
that
in
that
situation
there
would
be
an
administrative
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
no,
we're
not
fining
a
penny
until
the
first
mortgage
has
been
fully
paid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
--
yes
--
(voice
overlap)
--
to
the
--
to
the
owner
of
the
property,
to
the
owner
of
the
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
they
write
--
wipe
out
the
rights
of
the
owner
in
the
state
law
but
as
i
understand
state
law
if
there
is
any
excess
over
and
above
the
amount
necessary
to
satisfy
all
the
prior
claims
that
then
goes
back
to
the
owner
of
the
property.
that's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
my
understanding
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i'm
not
clear
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
it
would
go
back
to
the
original
owner
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
whole
purpose
of
these
interests
are
security
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
if
the
property
were
sold
for
less
than
the
principal
amount
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
not
--
there's
nothing
left.
i
would
think
that
if
there
was
--
and
the
property
would
sell
to
more
than
the
principle
amount
of
the
indebtedness
plus
all
liens,
any
additional
amount
would
revert
to
the
owner
of
the
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
--
we're
--
whatever
effect
this
would
have
on
their
right
under
the
state
law
is
a
matter
which
is
not
a
concern
of
ours.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
when
i
--
i
think
--
trying
to
ask
you
a
question
--
when
--
when
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
your
honor
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
--
i
may
be
in
error
in
california
law.
mr.
stewart
knows
more
about
it
than
i
do.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
--
no,
mr.
justice.
we
don't
claim
that
the
exercise
of
the
power
to
sale
under
state
law
is
void.
we
claim
that
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
sale
whatever
its
effect
maybe
as
between
the
private
parties
does
not
have
the
effect
of
eliminating
our
lien
on
the
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
as
far
as
state
law
provides,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
course
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
think
so
we
--
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
bank
cannot
possibly
be
hurt
financially
because
we
don't
claim
a
penny
until
the
mortgage
has
been
fully
satisfied.
if
there's
not
enough
in
this
property
to
produce
anything
more
than
the
amount
of
the
bank's
indebtedness,
we
don't
get
anything.
no
one
is
hurt.
all
that
we
say
is
we'd
like
to
have
an
opportunity
as
congress
has
provided
to
give
us
a
chance
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i
--
i
--
all
i
was
suggesting
is
that
there
is
no
--
in
--
unfairness
to
the
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
was
going
to
suggest
there
is
no
unfairness
to
the
bank
in
holding
that
the
federal
lien
is
not
eliminated
by
exercise
of
the
power
of
sale
since
the
bank
--
since
the
united
states
cannot
realize
any
of
the
proceeds
until
the
bank's
prior
claim
has
been
paid
in
full.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
in
any
of
the
--
any
access
over
and
above
the
value.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
mean
that
the
federal
statute
permits
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
are
not
making
a
constitution
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
because
if
--
if
this
court
concludes
that
congress
determined
that
the
validity
to
continued
existence
of
federal
liens
is
to
be
determined
by
state
court
procedures
that's
the
end
of
our
position.
and
indeed
mr.
justice
i
want
to
repeat
once
again
that
congress
specifically
so
decided
in
one
provision
of
2410
where
it
said,
that
in
the
event
there
is
a
judicial
sale,
a
foreclosure
at
a
judicial
sale
then
the
effect
of
all
liens
will
be
determined
as
they
are
under
local
law,
but
for
that
to
happen
there
must
be
a
--
the
united
states
must
be
made
a
party
to
a
foreclosure
suit
and
there
must
be
a
judicial
foreclosure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
is
our
basic
claim.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i'd
like
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
its
--
it's
exclusiveness
in
the
sense
that
congress
has
determined
the
procedures
for
the
discharge
of
federal
liens
and
has
not
permitted
the
states
by
the
exercise
of
their
own
procedures
affecting
state
interest
also
to
wipe
out
federal
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
congress
has
provided
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
the
--
the
answer
in
the
following
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
suit
if
i
may
suggest
mr.
justice,
the
suit
to
quiet
title
cannot
prevail
because
the
title
isn't
quieted
that
the
congress
had
said
that
you
cannot
use
these
state
procedures
to
eliminate
the
federal
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely
and
i
cannot
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
precisely
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
may
well
be
and
i
think
that
for
that
--
that
as
i've
indicated
the
statistics
show
that
this
is
a
usual
form
in
which
that
is
done.
that's
right,
that
the
--
the
prior
lienholder
cannot
hope
to
eliminate
the
federal
lien
merely
by
going
through
the
state
procedure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
do
you
mean
at
this
time
after
this
or
before?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
you
--
you
would
have
to
follow
these
requirements.
you
could
either
bring
--
bring
suit
to
foreclose.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
just
to
put
it
at
how
i
put
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
that
a
little
differently,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
title
can
be
quieted
now
because
of
what
happened
before.
in
other
words
--
i
--
their
claim
is
not
that
in
this
suit
the
liens
can
be
cut
off.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i
can't
mr.
justice
because
this
is
a
quiet
title
proceeding
under
2410.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
i
think
it's
a
--
an
unsuccessful
quiet
title
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
i
would
equate
in
terms,
mr.
justice,
these
terms
that
the
question
is
whether
a
quiet
title
suit
may
succeed
on
the
basis
of
what
has
previously
happened.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
far
as
the
mortgages,
as
far
as
the
mortgagor
and
the
mortgagee,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that
it
could
too,
the
one
thing
the
bank
could
do
is
to
bring
a
proceeding
under
7424,
which
will
be
to
have
a
validity
of
the
government's
lien
determined
or
on
this
proceeding
i
suppose,
although
the
court
granted
summary
judgment,
they
might
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
ask
the
district
court
itself
in
accordance
with
alternative
prayer
for
relief
to
decree
a
sale
of
the
property,
sale
under
the
authorization
of
the
marshal.
now
if
at
that
sale,
if
at
that
sale
the
property
brings
no
more
than
the
amount
of
their
debt
we're
out.
we
have
no
claim
to
anything
more.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
suppose
because
congress
has
given
us
the
right
to
move
these
cases
into
the
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
i
just
like
to
very
briefly
in
closing
point
out
that
what
we
had
here
was
the
trust
deed
conveyed
title
to
the
trustee,
but
the
california
courts
have
said
that
this
is
a
security
title
that's
all
they
said
and
it's
--
as
a
case
it
was
developed
in
california.
now
the
courts
have
treated
it
as
a
practical
matter
a
mortgage
and
a
deed
of
trust
is
very
similar
and
what
we
really
had
here
analytically
i
think
is
what
we
had
yesterday
in
the
brosnan
case
that
is,
the
indebtedness
was
created
and
in
order
to
secure
the
payment
of
this
indebtedness
the
debtor,
the
mortgagor
gave
to
the
mortgagee
or
the
trustee
or
the
beneficiary
the
power
to
apply
the
property,
to
sell
the
property
and
to
apply
the
proceeds
to
the
proceeds
towards
the
discharge
of
his
indebtedness,
but
they're
attached
to
this
property
prior
to
the
time
of
sale,
this
federal
lien
and
this
attached
basically
to
the
mortgagor
or
the
taxpayer's
interest
in
the
property.
and
under
well
established
principles
once
the
lien
attaches
to
property
when
the
property
is
sold
and
transferred
it
passes
with
the
lien
unless
the
act
of
sale
itself
operates
to
discharge
the
lien
from
the
property.
as
i've
indicated
we
think
it
is
clear
that
congress
has
said
that
except
when
you
--
or
comply
with
the
strict
requirements
of
2410,
the
state
nonjudicial
sales
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party
do
not
operate
to
eliminate
and
wipe
out
the
federal
liens
on
this
real
property
and
we
therefore
believe
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
