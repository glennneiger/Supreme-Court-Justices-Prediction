mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
if
--
if
you
argued
this
issue
that
you
rely
on
here
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
have
--
you've
abandoned
one
that
you
argued
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
argue
both
there?
the
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
you
are
arguing
here
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
the
survival
--
the
survival
of
the
lien,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
the
process?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
--
when
was
2410
enacted
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
no
--
i
just
--
may
i
apologize
for
one
more
--
what
has
been
the
practice
since
that
time
with
relation
to
matters
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
must
--
there
must
have
been
enumerable
cases
of
this
kind
occurs
since
1931.
and
i
am
wondering
what
the
practice
of
your
department
was
in
--
in
insisting
upon
the
right
to
the
government
to
be
joined
as
you
claim;
it
should
have
been
joined
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at,
has
your
practice
been
so
uniform
that
--
that
people
have
had
knowledge
of
this
thing
and
have
generally
conceded
that
that
is
the
practice
of
the
government
to
--
to
require
joining,
to
joining
the
government
in
actions
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
title
insurance
companies
throughout
the
country
recognized
that
this
is
essential
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
do,
i
am
not
questioning
you,
i
just
don't
know,
i
have
no
knowledge
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
states
that
have
made
their
law
to
conform?
do
you
know
mr.
friedman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jacob.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
and
this
without
any
reflection
of
course,
but
suppose
an
action
such
as
you
had
here
was
collusive
and
suppose
that
a
fictitious
amount
was
put
in
this
declaration,
and
the
ex
parte
judgment
was
given
and
then
you
notified
the
united
states
government
of
that
occurrence.
would
the
united
states
government
then,
under
your
pennsylvania
practice,
have
a
right
to
come
in
and
contest
the
amount
of
that
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
--
how
would
it
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
has
been
the
practice
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
real
estate
in
transactions
of
this
--
of
this
kind
where
--
where
the
government
has
a
junior
lien
as
--
they
power
the
practice
that
--
that
you're
trying
to
sustain
here
or
--
or
is
there
a
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
mr.
jacob.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jacob,
he
already
has.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jacobs
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
labor
the
practice
of
your
statement.
but
i
wonder
if
you
tell
me
this.
you
said
that
the
--
that
the
rights
become
final
when
the
--
when
the
sheriff
says
so,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
may
i
ask
you
this,
would
a
title
insurance
company
guarantee
the
purchaser's
title
on
this
record
as
you
have
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
they
would
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
would
insure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
their
state
procedure
doesn't
provide
for
--
for
any
notice
to
anyone
on
the
first
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
does
require
on
the
second
part
and
you
do
that
what
was
required
under
the
second
part
and
had
an
opportunity
to
--
to
establish
your
--
your
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where's
the
government
been
injured?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
where
is
your
-
where
is
it
violated
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
removed
it,
wouldn't
you
remove
it
with
whatever
--
to
the
federal
court
with
whatever
rights
the
government
might
have?
and
he
says
that
you
have
the
right
to
--
to
question
the
--
the
amount
that
is
due,
the
amount
that
was
in
that
ex
parte
order,
and
that
you
could
not,
in
any
way,
be
prejudiced
because
you
have
a
right
to
bring
in
all
those
things,
even
in
the
state
court.
and
if
you
took
the
federal
court,
why
couldn't
you
--
why
couldn't
you
have
the
same
rights
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

versus
the
united

mr.
stewart?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stewart,
before
you
get
to
your
charts
may
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
were,
in
the
bank
you
must
have
had
many
thousands
over
a
period
of
the
years
of
sales
of
this
kind,
sales
of
the
deeds
of
trust.
is
this
a
normal
procedure
that
you
have
followed
in
that
regard
or
is
this
--
is
this
a
novel
procedure
that
you
are
--
are
trying
to
establish
in
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now
the
foreclosure
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
general
practice
in
the
--
in
the
state,
in
this
regard,
do
--
do
you
know?
is
just
this
a
--
is
this
a
novel
procedure
that
you're
trying
to
establish
or
--
or
is
it
in
such
circumstances,
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
normal
procedure
that
is
--
is
used
in
such
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
reason
--
reason
i
was
asking
you
was
because
if
this
was
the
practice,
i
was
going
to
ask
what
the
attitude
of
the
government
has
been
when
it
was
used.
have
they
taken
an
exception
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
always
or,
always
or
--
they've
just
done
it
occasionally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
never
recognized
--
never
recognized
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
did
you
seek
partial
discharge
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
were
discussions
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
time
has
just
expired
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
suppose
you
prevail
in
this
case
and
you
go
back
to
the
district
court,
under
your
present
argument
there
will
be
a
trial
on
that
quiet
title
action,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
on
the
--
on
the
second
sale
the
property
brought
more
money
than
--
than
the
original
lien
plus
your
lien
the
surplus
would
go
back
to
the
first
lienholder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
thought
you
recognized
that
the
state
had
the
right
to
wipe
out
the
--
to
wipe
out
rights
of
the
--
of
the
owner
of
the
property
under
--
under
state
law.
i
thought
you
were
only
interested
in
your
lien.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
did
not
understand
--
at
least
mr.
stewart
--
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
give
mr.
steward
five
minutes
to
--
to
respond.
when
this
is
over
and
you
make
take
five
minutes
more
too
mr.
friedman
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
i
think
there
are
some
things
that
we'd
like
to
hear
from
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
that
when
one
may
when
--
on
the
original
sale
i
--
i
thought
so
far
as
private
lienholders
were
concerned
that
those
were
wiped
out
and
the
state
according
to
the
state's
procedure
and
you
--
you
agreed
to
that.
it's
only
your
--
your
only
objection
as
to
wiping
out
the
government's
lien.
now
if
you
come
in
and
have
a
second
--
a
second
sale,
are
you
going
to
reestablish
the
rights
of
the
junior
lienholders?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let
me
put
it
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
take
the
--
the
case
that
--
that
mr.
--
mr.
justice
brennan
submitted
to
you.
suppose
that
the
--
the
bank
loaned
$25,000.00.
the
tax
due
is
$5,000.00.
they
first
foreclose
the
--
the
property
and
wiped
you
out.
then
they
bring
this
action
to
quiet
title
as
against
the
--
the
government.
on
the
--
on
the
resale
of
the
property,
there
is
a
bid
of
$50,000.00.
that
would
give
you
back
or
give
the
bank
back
its
$25,000.00,
it
would
give
the
government
its
$5,000.00
and
make
$30,000.00
--
where
would
the
other
$20,000.00
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
interest
i
--
it's
clear
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
i
do
not
want
to
prolong
it
but
i
--
my
--
my
only
confusion
was
this.
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
you
recognized
that
through
this
power
of
sale
and
the
--
and
the
sale
itself
that
the
state
had
the
right
to
wipe
out
the
interest
of
the
owner
and
--
and
all
junior
liens
with
the
exception
of
the
united
states
government
and
--
and
because
the
government
is
the
government
they
can't
do
--
do
that,
but
now,
if
--
if
that
is
true
and
if
they
didn't
wipe
out
those
rights,
why
should
you,
through
this
kind
of
an
action,
reestablish
their
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well
that's
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
put
before
this
court
in
respect
of
lien.(laughter)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
always
trying
to
get
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stewart.
