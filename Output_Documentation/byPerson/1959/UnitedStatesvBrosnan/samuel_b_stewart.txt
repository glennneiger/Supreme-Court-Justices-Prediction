mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
it
is
an
action
pursuant
to
title
28
of
the
united
states
code,
section
2410,
about
which
the
court
heard
something
in
the
argument
of
the
brosnan
case
yesterday.
it
is
an
action
by
the
bank
of
america,
a
national
bank,
doing
business
in
california
against
the
united
states
to
quiet
title
of
the
bank
in
and
to
certain
land
and
chattels,
specifically
a
sawmill
and
the
equipment
of
it,
in
calaveras
county,
california.
the
action
was
started
in
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
california
as
permitted
by
california
law
and
was
removed
to
federal
district
court
on
the
motion
of
the
united
states.
both
sides
moved
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
of
the
plaintiff
bank,
denied
the
motion
of
the
defendant
government
and
decreed
that
the
bank
is
the
owner
of
the
land,
the
buildings,
and
the
equipment
in
question
and
that
the
government
is
barred
from
asserting
any
adverse
claim.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
this
court
last
october
granted
certiorari.
the
bank's
title
was
acquired
by
purchase
at
a
foreclosure
sale
held
pursuant
to
a
power
sale
of
in
a
first
deed
of
trust
on
the
land
and
the
power
of
sale
in
chattel
mortgages
on
the
personal
property.
the
government
was
made
a
defendant
because
it
holds
tax
liens
against
the
former
owner
of
the
land
and
chattels
and
the
government
claimed
that
its
tax
liens
attached
to
the
land
and
chattels
and
are
still
effective
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
no
longer
held
a
free
and
unencumbered
title
to
the
land
and
chattels
at
the
time
when
the
tax
lien
attached.
the
deed
of
trust,
and
i
may
from
this
point
on
refer
simply
to
the
deed
of
trust
without
elaborating
to
include
the
chattel
mortgage
because
i
think
the
principles
are
the
same
on
both
types
of
documents,
the
deed
of
trust
given
in
connection
with
the
bank
loan
and
the
chattel
mortgages
had
been
executed
by
the
taxpayer
or
a
predecessor
in
title
some
time
before
the
tax
lien
attached.
legal
title
to
the
real-estate
was
actually
in
the
trustee
under
the
deed
of
trust
when
the
government
acquired
its
tax
lien.
when
the
taxpayer
defaulted
in
the
payment
of
his
indebtedness,
the
land
and
chattels
were
sold
at
public
auction
in
accordance
with
the
contract
powers
of
sale
and
the
bank
became
the
purchaser
at
that
sale
at
public
auction.
all
notices
required
by
california
law
were
given,
but
these
did
not
include
in
a
special
notice
to
the
government
which
had
failed
to
request
special
notice
as
it
might
have
done
under
california
law.
the
primary
question
presented
here
is
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
well
if
your
honors
please,
the
government
initiates
its
proceedings
by
filing
a
notice
of
tax
lien.
presumably
with
due
diligence
it
would
investigate
the
assets
of
the
taxpayer
to
see
what
the
means
of
collection
might
be.
it
would
discover
that
the
property
was
subject
to
an
outstanding
lien
and
could
then
request
the
notice
even
though
no
default
had
occurred,
in
the
event
of
default
or
in
the
event
of
sale
and
it
would
then
receive
the
notice
automatically.
also
these
things
are
recorded
in
the
public
offices
and
there
are
any
number
of
services
and
publications
which
most
people
subscribe
to,
which
reveal
them.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir.
in
fact
you
don't
even
have
to
send
it
to
the
holder
of
the
first
lien.
you
merely
filed
with
in
the
--
in
the
registrar
of
records
office
and
this
takes
care
of
the
situation.
the
primary
question
here
is
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
well
they
filed
a
notice
of
tax
lien
and
then
if
they
want
a
special
notice
of
any
further
proceeding,
they
file
a
request.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
in
the
county
where
the
property
is
located,
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
there
is
this
proceeding,
this
optional
procedure
which
may
or
may
not
be
valid
and
was
not
valid
here
of
requesting
special
notice.
of
course
the
general
notice
is
given
by
publication
in
the
usual
legal
publications
which
are
followed
by
most
people
interested
in
these
things
anyway.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
no
sir,
no
sir
that
came
in
subsequently.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
any
junior
lien
or
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
--
yes
mr.
justice?
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
the
statute
--
the
state
statute,
i
think
we
have
cited
and
i
think
we
did
not
quote
it
sir.
it
is
cited
just
below
the
middle
of
page
three
of
our
brief,
its
california
civil
code,
section
2924
(b),
just
at
the
end
of
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
three
of
our
main
brief.
the
primary
question
presented
to
the
court
is,
does
the
purchaser
of
land
and
chattels
that
a
foreclosure
sale
held
pursuant
to
a
power
of
sale
and
the
first
deed
of
trust
and
chattel
mortgages,
acquire
title
free
of
subordinate
tax
liens
of
the
united
states?
there's
no
question
about
these
liens
being
subordinate
and
then
there
is
the
secondary
question,
may
such
a
purchaser
establish
his
clear
title
by
a
quiet
title
suit
against
the
united
states?
the
government
has
stated
the
question
somewhat
differently
and
i
pause
here
momentarily
to
emphasize
the
correctness
of
the
question
as
we
have
stated
it
because
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
events
in
the
vanston
committee
case
in
329
united
states,
“putting
the
wrong
questions
is
not
likely
to
beget
right
answers
even
in
law.”
the
government
says
that
the
question
is
whether
a
junior
federal
tax
lien
maybe
extinguished
through
a
non-judicial
sale
of
the
property
by
a
mortgagee
under
a
contractual
power
of
sale.
it
is
my
view
that
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
about
extinguishment.
no
suit
was
brought
to
extinguish.
the
statute,
section
3670
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
says
that
the
government's
lien
is,
“upon
all
property
and
rights
to
property,
whether
real
or
personal,
belonging
to
such
person”
that
is
the
taxpayer.
in
our
view
the
taxpayer's
right
out
or
to
which
the
government
lien
attached
was
a
defeasible
right
which
subsequently
dissolved
or
evaporated.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
this
is
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
but
i
know
mr.
justice
i
sympathize
with
you
because
it's
--
it's
one
that
has
caused
trouble
all
the
way
in
this
case
and
if
--
if
you'll
bear
with
me
just
a
few
moments,
i
--
i'm
going
to
address
the
next
few
minutes
of
my
--
my
argument
right
to
this
point
and
--
and
then
if
i
don't
clarify
it
i'll
try
to
do
it
again.
this
suit
assumes
that
the
government
lien
against
the
taxpayer
is
still
just
as
valid
as
it
ever
was
as
to
any
property
and
rights
to
property
belonging
to
the
taxpayer.
but
it
asserts
that
the
taxpayer
no
longer
has
any
right
to
property
insofar
as
the
land
and
chattels
in
this
action
are
concerned.
and
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
if
you
say
it
that
way
sir
there
is
no
difference
in
practical
results
at
all.
the
importance
of
the
point
is
that
you
do
not
extinguish
a
general
federal
tax
lien
by
this
method
because
the
tax
lien
is
applicable
to
all
property
of
the
taxpayer.
we're
dealing
here
only
with
specific
property
and
we
say
this
specific
property
is
no
longer
subject
to
the
lien
although
the
lien
may
still
be
in
effect
as
to
all
the
properties
that
the
taxpayer
may
own.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
well
they
stated
differently
and
i
think
that
difference
in
statement
has
caused
confusion
in
the
fact.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
and
if
you
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
if
it
is
stated
that
way
sir,
we
have
no
disagreement.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
the
same
federal
statutes
are
involved
in
this
case
as
were
involved
in
the
brosnan
case,
which
was
argued
to
your
honors
yesterday.
however,
as
this
court
reaffirmed
in
the
best
case
in
357
united
states,
section
3670
of
the
internal
revenue
code
creates
no
property
rights.
all
it
does
is
attach
consequences
to
such
right
as
are
created
under
state
law.
i
think
it
maybe
worth
a
few
moments
without
over
emphasizing
it
therefore
to
discuss
the
nature
of
a
deed
of
trust
under
california
law,
as
well
as
to
go
into
a
little
more
detail
about
the
alternative
procedures
that
are
available
both
to
lienholders
such
as
the
bank
and
lienholders
such
as
the
government.
the
clearest
statement
that
i
have
found
of
the
nature
of
a
deed
of
trust
in
california
is
found
in
a
1933
case
of
the
california
supreme
court
entitled
bank
of
italy
against
bentley
and
i'd
like
to
read
just
a
sentence
or
two
from
that
opinion
which
states
it,
i
think
quite
clearly.
the
court
there
said
“although
this
state,
california,
at
an
early
date
adopted
the
lien
theory
of
mortgages,
it
adopted
the
title
theory
in
reference
to
deeds
of
trust.”
in
the
early
case
of
koch
against
briggs
it
was
held
that
the
mortgages
and
deeds
of
trust
were
fundamentally
different
in
that,
in
a
mortgage,
only
a
lien
was
created
while
in
a
deed
of
trust,
the
title
actually
passed
to
the
trustee.
this
distinction
although
frequently
attacked
by
counsel
and
often
criticized
by
the
courts
has
become
well
settled
in
our
law
and
cannot
now
be
disturbed.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that
is
217
california
644,
your
honor
and
certiorari
was
denied
in
290
u.s.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that
is
--
that
is
in
our
--
our
supplemental
memorandum,
yes,
sir.
the
deed
of
trust
given
as
here
in
connection
with
a
bank
loan
conveys
legal
title
to
the
trustee
for
the
benefit
of
the
bank.
it
also
contains
the
power
of
sale
which
authorizes
the
trustee
to
sell
the
real-estate
in
the
event
of
the
default.
now
the
trustor
borrower
retains
certain
rights.
he
retains
the
right
to
possession
and
he
retains
the
right
to
reacquire
the
legal
title,
if
he
pays
his
debt
when
due.
and
of
course
this
bundle
of
rights
has
been
called
by
various
names,
but
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
that
whatever
you
call
it.
this
bundle
of
rights
retained
by
the
trustor
is
--
is
clearly
not
a
free
and
unencumbered
fee
title.
the
trustor-borrower
cannot
convey
to
any
third
party,
any
greater
right
than
those
he
retains.
and
if
he
has
an
attempt
--
if
he
attempts
to
convey
to
a
third
party,
x
let's
say,
such
a
conveyance
subtracts
nothing
from
the
rights
of
the
trustee
under
the
deed
of
trust
and
the
power
of
sale.
on
default
by
trustee,
may
sell,
free
and
unencumbered
title,
fee
title
and
no
one
claiming
under
the
trustor-borrower
may
attack
that
title
of
the
purchaser
at
such
a
trustee
sale
and
that's
california
property
law,
and
there's
no
dispute
about
it.
it's
been
reaffirmed
in
the
subsequent
carpenter
against
small
claims
committe
in
the
california
supreme
court
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
it
was
recently
restated
by
the
federal
court
in
california,
in
the
northern
district
of
california
and
the
higley
case
against
the
city
of
sacramento
cited
in
our
brief.
one
sentence
there
may
be
worth
repeating.
the
federal
court
said
the
“the
general
rule
in
california
is
that
a
sale
by
the
trustee
under
the
power
of
sale
and
the
deed
of
trust
has
the
effect
of
vesting
the
purchaser
with
title
as
of
the
date
when
the
trust
deed
was
executed”,
which
results
in
the
extinguishment,
if
i
may
use
the
word
extinguishment,
results
in
the
extinguishment
of
all
liens
on
the
property
attaching
subsequently
to
the
trustee.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
not
on
the
sale
pursuant
to
a
trust
deed
mr.
justice.
now,
yesterday
inquiries
were
made
in
the
course
of
the
brosnan
argument
as
to
state
procedures
which
were
available
and
how
the
government
might
protect
itself
and
i'm
anticipating
your
honors'
interest
in
similar
questions
as
to
california,
i'd
like
to
take
a
few
moments
just
to
outline
those.
there
are
several
loan
alternatives,
some
of
which
maybe
initiated
by
the
government
and
some
by
the
holder
of
the
deed
of
trust.
the
first
step
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
is
that
the
government
files
notice
of
its
tax
lien.
then
exercising
reasonable
prudence
presumably
it
investigates
the
taxpayer's
assets.
i
--
it's
a
matter
of
public
record
of
which
i
assume
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
a
budget
of
$128,000,000
a
year
for
tax
audits
and
$18,000,000
a
year
for
investigation
of
tax
frauds
and
do
special
services
and
if
this
isn't
enough
to
cover
it
they
can
get
a
title
report
for
$25
which
will
show
them
the
entire
status
of
the
--
of
the
property.
so
having
determined
this,
if
the
taxpayer
is
shown
to
be
trustor
as
this
one
was
of
a
real-estate
deed
of
trust,
the
government
records
a
simple
request
or
notice
of
default
and
notice
of
sale
in
the
event
that
there
is
one.
this
may
happen
before
default.
it
will
thereafter
receive
notice
and
be
able
to
protect
its
interest
by
bidding
it
to
public
auction
or
by
a
suit
if
one
should
be
indicated
to
enjoin
any
sale
under
of
the
power
of
sale,
this
is
if
the
government
questions
the
validity
of
the
deed
of
trust
which
of
course
it
does
not
do
in
this
case.
now,
alternative,
the
government
may
sue
under
section
7403
of
title
26
u.s.
code
which
was
mentioned
yesterday
to
foreclose
its
lien.
that
is
to
subject
the
taxpayer's
property
whatever
it
may
be,
whatever
he's
interest
in
property
maybe
to
the
payment
of
the
tax.
it
doesn't
have
to
wait
for
action
by
the
holder
of
the
deed
of
trust;
it
can
take
this
action
itself
or
a
third
alternative,
if
it
does
not
choose
to
follow
either
of
those
two,
the
government
may
levy
and
(inaudible)
for
taxes
under
section
6331
in
following
of
title
26.
this
is
an
administrative
procedure
which
results
in
a
sale
of
public
auction
at
the
instance
of
the
government.
so
there
are
at
least
three
methods
which
the
government
may
pursue
to
protect
its
rights
or
if
it
chooses
not
to
do
that,
it
may
wait
as
it
did
here,
for
a
prior
action
by
the
prior
lienholder
and
in
that
event
the
holder
of
the
deed
of
trust
has
at
least
three
alternatives.
in
the
first
place,
he
may
request
an
administrative
partial
discharge
of
the
government
lien
from
the
property
in
question.
and
this
is
normally
accompanied
by
appraisals
of
value
of
the
property
showing
the
amount
of
the
equity,
if
any,
and
offering
to
pay
to
the
extent
that
any
equity
is
shown,
tells
the
--
this
excess
and
then
go
through
the
normal
procedures.
and
this
i
might
say,
it's
not
in
the
record
but
if
your
honors
are
interested
in
the
practical
procedures
that
are
followed,
this
is
what's
normally
done.
this
is
one
reason
we
don't
have
any
more
of
these
cases.
at
least
it's
--
it's
what
the
bank
of
america
normally
does
--
it
does
and
i'm
sure
a
great
many
others
do
the
same
thing
and
that
this
results
in
the
--
in
the
disposition
of
a
good
many
of
the
cases
where
this
problem
arises.
however,
where
this
doesn't
work,
if
there's
a
disagreement
about
values
and
or
for
some
other
reasons
the
government
doesn't
choose
to
give
it's
administrative
consent
and
of
course
it's
free
to
do
this,
if
there
is
no
way
of
compelling
it
then
the
holder
of
the
prior
lien
has
two
more
alternatives.
he
may
sue
to
foreclose
the
deed
of
trust
as
a
mortgage.
this
is
effective,
it's
cumbersome,
it's
expensive.
it
normally
takes
two
to
three
years
to
clear
a
title
when
this
procedure
is
followed.
it
is
not
warranted
in
a
practical
business
world
unless
there
is
a
need
and
desire
for
a
deficiency
judgment.
under
state
law
you
--
you
have
to
go
through
this
procedure
if
you
seek
a
deficiency
of
judgment
against
the
--
the
borrower,
but
you
don't
have
to
do
it
if
you
don't
care
about
the
deficiency
of
judgment
and
this
brings
us
to
the
third
alternative
which
is
the
one
followed
in
this
case.
the
holder
the
deed
of
trust
may
sell
under
the
power
of
sale.
a
sale
of
public
auction
which
there
is
a
90-day
notice
filed
of
default
followed
by
21
days
of
publication
in
the
legal
newspapers
of
the
county
where
the
--
where
the
property
is
situated
and
normally
the
whole
procedure
is
finished
in
120
days.
it
is
simple,
it
is
inexpensive,
it
makes
possible
prompt
liquidation
which
is
for
the
benefit
of
all
concerned
because
you
don't
run
up
a
lot
of
costs
to
depreciation
the
value.
if
there
is
likely
to
be
any
excess,
it
--
it
develops
better
this
way
and
it
leads
to
results
in
a
discharge
of
the
obligation
without
the
possible
deficiency
of
judgment
which
might
lead
them
to
further
assets
of
the
borrower.
then
if
the
government
still
after
this
procedure
has
gone
through,
if
the
government
still
is
stubborn
about
its
lien,
still
stubbornly
asserts
its
lien
as
it
did
here,
having
it
ignored
its
numerous
other
means
of
protecting
itself
which
i've
outlined
the
purchaser
of
the
deed
of
trust
sale
may
sue
as
this
purchaser,
the
bank
did
here
to
quiet
title.
now
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir,
indeed.
this
--
this
is
the
real
issue
in
this
case
whether
this
remedy
is
an
appropriate
one
and
although
it
has
come
up
for
adjudication
in
the
lower
courts,
this
is
the
first
time
i
believe
that
it
has
reached
this
court.
and
this
is
the
main
reason
we're
here,
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
--
of
this
remedy,
this
simple
inexpensive
remedy
as
against
government
tax
liens.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that
is
correct,
sir.
now
one
thing
i
noticed
in
yesterday's
argument,
i
think
i
might
turn
you
to
right
now.
i
planned
to
bring
it
up
later
but
this
is
probably
as
good
a
time
as
any.
the
2410
was
spoken
off
yesterday
as
if
it
offered
a
single
procedure
for
obtaining
a
clear
title
against
government
tax
liens.
this
is
not
correct.
section
2410
offers
two
alternative
procedures.
the
first
is
by
a
suit
to
quiet
title.
the
second
is
by
a
suit
to
foreclose
the
mortgage.
now
many
procedural
details
to
be
followed
in
such
suits
are
spelled
out
in
subdivision
(d)
and
(c)
of
that
section,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
that
section
to
indicate
that
a
suit
to
foreclose
is
essential
or
whether
the
suit
to
foreclose
is
a
prerequisite
to
a
suit
to
quiet
title
or
that
a
quiet-title
action
is
dependent
in
any
way
upon
the
prior
completion
of
a
foreclosure
action
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
amendment
is
quite
interesting.
it
is
totally
inconsistent
in
my
judgment
with
any
notion
that
a
foreclosure
is
necessary
if
the
quiet-title
procedure
is
followed.
it
is
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it
shows
quite
clearly
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
provide
an
expedient
procedure
for
clearing
the
title
(inaudible)
government's
claim
in
respect
the
property
of
which
no
valid
lien
is
attached
in
lieu
of
the
complex,
expensive,
dilatory
procedure
by
action
to
foreclose.
and
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
specific
attention
to
the
most
important
element
of
that
legislative
history.
it
is
set
out
on
page
10
of
petitioner's
main
brief.
this
amendment
was
adopted
in
response
to
a
request
made
by
the
then
attorney
general
jackson
in
a
letter
which
the
relevant
part
of
which
i've
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
page
10
and
i
think
that's
worth
reading.
attorney
general
jackson
said,
“it
should
be
observed
in
this
connection
that
under
existing
law”,
this
is
back
1942,
“under
existing
law
there
is
no
provision
whereby
the
owner
of
real-estate
may
clear
his
titles
in
such
real-estate
of
the
cloud
of
a
government
mortgage
or
lien.
in
many
instances
persons
acting
in
good
faith
have
purchased
real-estate
without
knowledge
of
the
government
lien
or
in
the
belief
that
the
lien
had
been
extinguished
and
then
this
important
language,
in
other
instances
mortgagees
have
foreclosed
on
property
and
have
failed
to
join
the
united
states.
it
appears
that
justice
and
fair
dealing
would
require
that
a
method
would
be
provided
to
clear
real-estate
titles
of
questionable
or
worthless
government
liens.
accordingly
i
suggest
that
the
bill
be
amended
by
inserting
the
phrase
“to
quiet
title
or”
between
the
words
matter,
“and
for
the
foreclosure
of”
in
line
4
in
phase
ii
of
the
bill
and
the
congress
did
it.
and
it
is
our
view,
that
that
set
up
a
completely
independent
alternative
procedure
in
which
the
congress
specifically
intended
to
approve
the
procedure
which
has
been
followed
in
this
case.
it
is
here
of
your
honors'
interpretation
for
the
first
time.
now
this
brings
me
to
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir.
if
the
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
it
appears
at
page
two
of
the
appendix
your
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
to
--
to
quiet
title
to
or
for
the
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage
or
other
lien.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
not
--
not
in
this
technical
interpretation
because
that
was
not
a
suit
to
quiet
title
in
the
brosnan
case.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that
is
my
view,
sir.
my
view
is
that
the
title
effectively
passed
by
the
power
of
sale
which
is
a
foreclosure
sale
but
a
different
procedure
for
it
than
a
foreclosure
suit
and
that
therefore
no
further
foreclosure
is
necessary
but
all
that
is
now
necessary
is
a
decree
quieting
the
title
and
the
purchaser.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
well
you
have
the
same
problem
to
those
extents
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
if
you
read
that
2410
as
providing
only
one
procedure
instead
of
two
alternative
procedures,
then
obviously
we
would
have
to
comply
with
all
of
the
conditions
that
set
forth
in
2410
with
respect
to
a
foreclosure
suit.
but
it
is
our
view
that
if
that
were
the
interpretation,
the
1942
amendment
would
be
utterly
meaningless.
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
putting
it
in
because
if
you
go
through
all
that
complicated
foreclosure
proceeding
you
have
clear
title
anyhow
and
there
is
--
but
with
no
quiet-title
action
is
needed.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
of
it
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
well
it
seems
to
me
sir
that
it
may
make
a
difference
if
the
congress
has
specifically
said
that
it
does
make
a
difference
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
effect
of
the
1942
amendment.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
“to
a
quiet
title
or.”
it
seems
to
me
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
that
amendment
if
you
still
had
to
go
through
the
same
old
procedure
anyway.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
oh,
oh
well
then
to
that
extent
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
agree
with
you
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
be
a
participant
in
the
alternative
procedures
to
be
--
the
same
--
same
extent
as
any
other
junior
lienholder
entitled
to
be
and
i've
outlined
the
various
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i
think
that
is
(inaudible)
yes
and
i
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i
would
make
this
observation
on
--
on
that
comment
by
your
honor.
if
the
government
knew
that
--
the
federal
government
has
adequate
power
through
the
congress
to
protect
its
tax
--
its
tax
liens.
the
sole
purpose
of
putting
in
this
procedure
for
quieting
title
was
a
recognition
by
the
federal
congress
that
this
was
an
alternative
means
which
would
provide
adequate
protection
for
the
government
and
i
think
i
have
indicated
by
the
various
proceedings
which
are
available
that
there
is
more
than
adequate
means
of
protection
for
the
government.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
well
i
think
they
might
have
required
that
sir
but
i
don't
think
they
did.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i
say
this
statute
doesn't
do
it
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
amendment,
and
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
amendment.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
may
i
just
call
your
honors'
attention
again
to
the
italicized
language
on
page
10
in
attorney
general
jackson's
letter
which
requested
this
amendment.
in
which
he
referred
to
other
instances
in
which
mortgagees
have
foreclosed
on
property
and
have
failed
to
join
the
united
states.
it
appeared
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that
would
be
the
only
purpose
sir
of
joining.
i
say
this
expressly
contemplated
a
procedure
in
which
they
would
not
be
notice
and
in
which
there
would
not
be
a
judicial
proceeding
on
it.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
now
the
only
rationalization
of
course
--
i
--
i
have
to
speculate
about
this
because
this
is
all
the
records
shows
your
honor,
the
only
rationalization
i
can
give
you
is
that
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
this
simple
inexpensive
procedures
for
quieting
of
title
by
a
prior
lienholders
are
available
in
many
states
of
the
united
states
and
a
feeling
that
--
this
procedure
should
be
recognized
by
the
federal
government
that
it
had
adequate
means
to
protect
itself
in
these
procedures
and
that
it
would
be
advantaged
by
the
adoption
of
a
simple
procedure
as
well
as
what
others
subsequent
liensholders.
that's
the
only
rationalization
i
can
give
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir,
under
the
first
alternative
procedure,
the
quiet
title.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
oh
in
the
quiet-title
suit,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
correct.
the
suit
is
against
the
government.
the
government
is
the
only
defendant
in
this
quiet
title
actually.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
they
claim
i'm
wrong
sir.
they
claim
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
--
in
that
procedure,
if
this
were
procedure,
it
had
the
effect
of
clearing
title
of
everybody
else's
lien
but
not
our
lien.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
if
--
if
i'm
right
then
all
this
proceeding
does
is
give
me
a
judicial
declaration
that
what
i
say
is
totally
so.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that
we
have
clear
title.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
well
i
think
we
could
not
have
successfully
maintained
it
before.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
because
the
lien
was
still
effective
and
we
didn't
have
a
clear
title
then.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that
is
correct,
it's
really
a
proceeding
to
remove
the
cloud
on
time,
and
anytime
the
government
has
filed
a
lien,
this
is
the
cloud
which
bothers
the
purchasers.
it
impairs
the
marketability
of
the
property.
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
--
of
this
quiet-title
proceeding,
it's
the
purpose
of
quiet-title
proceedings
of
the
country
over.
i
think
it
may
clarify
our
position
--
just
a
bit
if
i
may
run
quickly
through
some
chart
of
the
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i
have
to
answer
this
--
that
question
this
way
mr.
chief
justice.
there
have
not
been
so
many
thousands
in
the
period
since
this
--
well
went
on
the
books
in
1942.
there
were
some
thousands
back
in
the
depression
years.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
the
foreclosure
--
there
--
there
have
not
been
too
many
foreclosure
proceedings
in
the
year
since
1942.
the
normal
procedure
which
is
followed
is
the
one
i
mentioned
first
of
seeking
by
negotiation
with
the
government
an
administrative
partial
discharge
of
this
property
supported
by
appraisals
indicating
that
there
is
no
equity
and
that
when
we
go
through
our
procedure
we
will
have
the
whole
thing
anyhow.
the
--
t
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
there
is
authorization
under
the
federal
statute;
i
don't
have
that
citation
readily
available,
may
be
mr.
friedman
can
give
it
to
me,
but
--
now
this
is
a
--
a
i
recognized
--
yes,
it's
--
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
22,
section
6325
authorizes
release
through
in
and
by
administrative
procedure,
and
they've
been
quite
cooperative
on
this,
we
have
no
complaint
about
that
at
all.
but
human
beings
do
disagree
at
times,
and
where
you
disagree
you
have
to
have
some
other
procedure.
now,
we
have
sometime,
brought
the
procedure
to
--
to
foreclose
the
long
way.
we
--
we've
tried
our
hand
at
it
and
found
it
a
very
poor
hand
because
of
the
time
that's
consumed
by
it
and
frankly
we
have
attempted
this
in
civil
cases.
we've
never
gotten
up
here
with
it
before
and
there's
been
uncertainty
about
it
because
the
--
the
lower
courts
have
disagreed
about
it
and
that's
the
reason
we're
here,
to
have
a
--
a
conflict
of
the
circuits
resolved
as
to
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
i
could
hardly
say
it
is
the
normal
procedure
because
people
have
been
afraid
of
it,
because
the
government
hasn't
recognized
it.
i
know
there
is
a
--
a
wide-spread
hope
that
it
will
be
the
normal
procedure
for
the
number
of
requests
and
telephone
calls
i've
had
about
this
case.
everybody
is
--
is
much
interested
in
having
this
procedure
available,
but
i
can
only
judge
from
the
--
the
record
which
does
not
indicate
a
large
number
of
cases
in
which
it
has
been
tried
and
the
fact
that
it
has
just
now
reached
this
court.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
no,
they
--
they
have
not
recognized
it
as
well.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
except
as
a
threat
that
may
have
induced
them
to
give
us
an
administrative
partial
discharge
in
some
case.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
it
may
have
been
effective
there.
i
can't
judge
their
mental
operations
on
that.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
this
is
not
in
the
record,
sir.
the
--
the
fact
is
that
there
--
there
were
discussions
of
it.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes,
but
the
record
does
not
show
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
--
what
that
was.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
they
would
have
received
notice
of
the
default.
they
would
have
received
notice
of
the
sale.
they
would
have
had
the
right
to
appear
at
the
sale
and
bid
and
if
they
thought
there
was
an
excess
value
to
pay
us
off
and
take
the
property.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
then
they
could
have
brought
a
proceeding
for
an
injunction
to
restrain
the
sale
and
this
is
done
when
--
we
don't
have
it
done
too
often
frankedly
--
frankly
but
this
--
this
is
done,
where
people
do
challenge
that.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
they
would
all
have
been
available
to
them,
yes,
sir
and
we
would
then
be
in
the
same
posture
that
we
are
now.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i
see
my
time
is
running
short.
i
think
we
can
charge
any
help
that
--
just
clarify
the
situation.
as
i
see
we
have
four
successive
--
five
postures
here.
in
the
first
situation
the
taxpayer
holds
unencumbered
legal
title
to
his
(inaudible).
then
the
taxpayer
borrows
money
from
the
bank
and
executes
a
(inaudible)
which
is
duly
recorded.
this
creates
situation
number
two
which
the
trustee
under
the
deed
of
trust
holds
legal
title
and
a
power
of
sale.
the
taxpayer
has
a
right
to
reacquire
if
he
pays
his
obligation
when
due,
but
that
right
is
subject
to
dissolution
by
the
trustee
if
exercised
of
the
power
sale.
then
we
have
situation
number
three,
this
being
chronologically
indicated
in
which
the
government
acquires
a
tax
lien
on
the
taxpayer's
right
to
reacquire
but
no
lien
on
the
legal
title
if
the
taxpayer
does
not
default.
but
if
the
taxpayer
defaults
on
his
deed
of
trust
obligation,
the
trustee
(inaudible)
his
legal
title
then
you
have
the
contract
right
to
do
under
a
state
law
and
this
preempts
our
fourth
and
final
situation
in
which
the
buyer
of
the
deed
of
trust
sale
has
unencumbered
legal
title
to
the
real-estate,
the
taxpayer's
right
to
reacquire
had
expired
by
the
term
and
no
property
right
exists
to
which
the
government
lien
can
attach.
and
then
to
summarize
the
whole
thing
in
a
few
words
as
i
can
put
it
in,
in
the
first
place
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
a
house.
then
the
trustees
they're
entitled
to
a
house
for
the
benefit
of
the
bank.
the
taxpayer
has
the
right
to
reacquire.
the
government
acquires
a
lien
on
the
taxpayer's
right
to
reaquire
but
the
government
has
no
liens
against
the
trustee
or
the
bank.
if
the
taxpayer
defaults,
the
trustee
sells,
the
bank
buys
the
trustee's
title,
the
taxpayer's
right
to
reacquire
dissolves,
is
gone
forever,
and
the
government
lien
remains
firmly
attached
in
that.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir,
if
--
he
encumbers
whatever
this
bundle
of
rights
is
that
he
has
left
and
as
i
analyze
them,
the
legal
effects
of
it
is,
it's
a
right
to
possession
until
he's
in
default
and
it's
a
right
to
reacquire
if
he
faces
debt.
now
you
can
call
it
anything
you
want.
some
people
have
called
it
illegal
estate.
some
people
have
called
it
an
equity
of
redemption.
it's
been
called
all
kinds
of
things.
but
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
he
conveys
whatever
he
has
left
after
that
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
no,
sir
because
the
legal
title
is
in
the
trustee.
the
legal
title
is
in
the
trustee
under
the
deed
of
trust
and
he
conveys
the
right
to
reacquire
that
legal
title
by
paying
off
his
debts.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
oh
not
quiet
title.
no,
no,
sir
i
do
not
challenge
its
--
its
right
to
be
made
a
party
to
some
action
but
i
say
there
are
alternatives
in
the
statute
and
maybe
either
an
action
is
required.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
no
sir.
my
time
is
about
to
expire,
i
would
like
to
reserve
--
whatever
few
minutes
i
have
left
for
the
rebuttal.
there
are
numerous
situations
in
which
this
problem
has
been
dealt
with
in
the
lower
courts.
i
believe
they're
all
set
out
in
our
briefs
and
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice
i
thank
you
for
the
additional
five
minutes.
i
should
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
one
reference
which
it
seems
to
me
demonstrates
the
utter
inconsistency
of
the
government's
position
here
and
then
i'll
devote
the
rest
of
the
five
minutes
to
an
effort
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
that
were
asked
of
my
friend
on
the
other
side.
the
reference
is
to
a
revenue
ruling
which
is
quoted
on
page
6
of
the
petitioner's
main
brief
which
is
rather
short
and
it
seems
to
me
feels
directly
with
the
question
involved
here.
it
says,
"federal
tax
liens
attach
to
property
only
to
the
extent
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
interest
therein
where
a
taxpayer
has
only
an
option
to
purchase
real
estate"
and
this
deals
with
an
option
now
but
it
seems
to
me
closely
analogous
to
our
situation
here,
“where
the
taxpayer
has
only
an
option
to
purchase
real
property
at
the
time
the
federal
tax
lien
arises,
the
lien
attaches
to
the
option,
that
is,
to
the
interest
of
the
taxpayer
not
to
the
real
estate.
where
his
rights
under
the
option
are
terminable
the
government's
right
by
virtue
of
its
lien
upon
the
taxpayer's
interest,
are
likewise
terminable,
being
no
greater
than
those
of
the
taxpayer.”
accordingly,
when
the
taxpayer's
rights
under
an
option
terminate
after
the
federal
tax
lien
has
arisen
the
rights
of
the
united
states
in
the
option
also
terminates
since
there
is
no
longer
any
property
in
the
option
to
which
a
lien
may
attach.
it
seems
to
me
sir
you
can
apply
that
word
for
word,
syllable
for
syllable
to
the
situation
here,
the
government's
lien
attaches
to
the
taxpayer's
interest,
a
defeasible
interest,
something
less
than
a
total,
free,
and
unencumbered
fee
title
of
the
property
and
when
that
title
is
gone
so
is
the
government's
tax
lien
gone
with
it.
and
now
to
go
to
the
question
that
was
asked
of
mr.
friedman
i
believe
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
could
you
do
before
1924?
you
couldn't
do
anything
except
buy
the
government
off
because
there
was
no
procedure
that
was
authorized.
then
came
2410,
originally
in
a
form,
that
authorized
only
a
foreclosure
suit.
then
we
could
get
rid
of
them
if
we
wanted
to
go
three
years,
through
three
years
of
trouble
and
expense
to
do
it.
then
came
the
amendment
in
1942
to
2410
which
if
your
honors
agree
with
my
contention
here
has
simplified
the
procedure
which
was
the
only
excuse
for
having
that
amendment,
to
permit
another
method
not
this
complicated
three-year
proceeding
but
a
simple
method
of
going
through
the
simple
procedure
recognized
by
most
of
the
states.
yes
sir?
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
unless
we
can
deal
with
it
administratively,
sir,
that's
the
only
legal
option
we
have.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
--
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
well
2410
is
the
same
thing
sir.
all
2410
does
is
prescribe
certain
standards
of
state
foreclosure
proceedings.
in
other
words,
your
state
foreclosure
proceeding
must
meet
these
tests
of
notice,
right
to
redeem,
and
all
the
other
things
that
that
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i
can't
tell
you
why
sir
except
that
it
does,
that
this
is
our
experience.
it
has
been
a
two
years
minimum,
three
years
more
normal.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
no
sir
it's
the
--
it's
the
--
well
this
is
part
of
it,
yes
sir
court
congestion
plus
the
year
of
right
of
redemption
on
the
end
of
it.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
of
course
we
have
no
right
to
go
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
we
have
to
start
on
the
state
court.
it
is
only
when
the
--
when
the
government
removes
us
to
the
federal
court
that
we
get
into
the
federal
court.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
but
if
you'll
get
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
no
mr.
justice
black
i
--
i
have
to
think
i've
not
made
my
self
clear,
let
me
try.
the
remedy
to
quiet
title
is
not
a
procedure
for
settling
liens
and
for
determining
who
has
what
rights
one
against
another.
it
is
a
proceeding
for
determining
what
has
been
done
heretofore.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
well,
mr.
justice
black
perhaps
--
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
perhaps
--
perhaps
the
court
can
straighten
me
off,
but
my
interpretation
of
that
is
this
that
the
approval
of
a
quiet
title
procedure
was
necessarily
an
approval
of
quiet
title
procedure
which
exists
under
state
law.
this
is
the
only
procedure
to
which
we
have
access.
we
could
not
get
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
on
the
ground
that
this
involved
a
federal
statute
or
--
or
suit
against
the
government.
we
have
to
sue
in
the
state
court
we
have
a
quiet
title
procedure
in
the
state
as
most
states
do
and
our
quiet
title
procedure
in
the
state
of
california
is
a
procedure
to
determine
that
title
should
be
quieted
because
no
rights
exist.
now,
this
we
have
followed
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
this
again
sir
is
--
is
a
--
a
different
proceeding.
it
is
not
a
proceeding
to
quiet
title.
it's
--
it's
a
--
an
equally
complex
proceeding
with
the
foreclosure
procedure.
the
--
you
see
the
issue
here
is
not
one
of
whether
we
could
do
something
else.
we
could
do
several
other
things.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
congress
by
adopting
this
amendment
intended
to
expedite
proceedings,
intended
to
make
it
possible
to
follow
a
simple
remedy
that
save
the
cumbersomeness
and
the
expense
and
do
things
in
the
way
that
business
is
ordinarily
transacted
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
government
is
a
party.
that's
--
that's
our
purpose.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
if
it
is
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
i
--
i
think
sir
that
that
is
the
issue
except
there's
a
question
of
interpretation
on
what
kind
of
litigation.
now
we
say
the
kind
we
brought
here
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
--
is
the
only
kind
that
will
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
but
not
the
quiet
title,
sir.
the
quiet
title
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
that's
right
sir.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
if
it
means
the
--
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
then
i
say
it
does
not
make
it
right.
mr.
samuel
b.
stewart
thank
you,
your
honors.
