justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
decision
cuts
you
often
times,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
state
law,
was
there
any
equity
of
redemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
statement
as
the
practical
matter
or
the
government
prevails
exist
to
say
then
that
whenever
there's
a
federal
tax
lien,
junior
to
a
mortgage
in
any
state,
the
only
thing
the
mortgagee
can
do
safely
is
to
bring
a
proceeding
under
this
25,
whatever
it
is.
2410.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
to
work
that
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
it
means.
this
is
then
to
say
that
he
can't
resort
any
state
procedure
other
than
a
2410
procedure
maybe
brought
to
a
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
to
what
federal
taxes
and
what
federal
tax
liens
that
this
construed?
not
only
income
would
construe
of
the
state
taxes,
federal
state
taxes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
that
satisfy
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman
may
i
just
get
this
clear?
in
my
own
home
state,
there
is
provision
made
under
our
foreclosure
procedures
for
bringing
the
united
states
in
for
junior
lien.
although
i
understand
you
say
that
that
procedure
is
not
operable
that
the
only
procedure
that
maybe
operative,
effectively
the
deal
with
the
united
states
and
the
junior
lienor
is
the
2410
procedure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
comply?
as
2410
sets
up
its
own
procedures
as
you
prescribed
to
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
can
the
new
jersey
legislature
do
to
make
it
comply,
to
make
its
own
state
procedures
comply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
the
procedure
of
the
new
jersey
legislature
adopted
a
procedure
identical
in
form
and
terms
with
the
2410
procedure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
where
--
there's
nothing
i
gather
explicit
in
2410
which
says
what
you
said
to
me
earlier
namely
that
the
new
jersey
legislature
can
adopt
in
terms
a
procedure
which
satisfies
2410,
which
would
permit
an
action
in
a
new
jersey
court
which
could
have
the
effect
of
cutting
off
the
united
states
liens.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
concretely,
will
that
have
the
effect
of
clearing
the
title
of
the
federal
lien?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
now,
what
about
the
removal?
may
such
a
case
then
be
removed
by
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
actually
then
the
termination
will
not
be
made
under
new
jersey
courts
but
will
be
removed
in
the
united
states
district
court
if
the
united
states
wants
to
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
get
clear
of
what
--
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i
gather,
if
you
had
--
if
you
had
to
prevail,
this
means
although
a
junior
lienor,
you
get
paid
in
the
mortgage
you
get
nothing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
jacob,
there
is
nothing
in
the
pennsylvania
law
that
required
you
to
give
this
notice
to
the
united
states
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
--
if
you
knew
the
meaning?
merely
they
filed
a
notice
of
tax
lien,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
where
is
the
notice
of
tax
lien
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
in
addition
to
that
there
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
this
time
that
--
at
the
time
that
--
the
contract
right
for
sale
that
you
described
for
us,
is
executed
was
there
a
notice
of
record
of
the
government's
tax
lien
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you've
got
2410?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
stewart,
what
--
what'
the
--
what
is
this
that
the
government
now
in
a
position
to
vindicate
after,
as
i
understand
--
the
foreclosure
or
whatever
those
procedures
are
that's
been
described
for
us
is
having
second
place
here
that
is
the
sale
pursuant
to
the
contract
or
probation?
i
thought
you
told
us
that
this
has
the
effect
under
california
law
of
releasing
the
property
from
many
junior
lien.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
when
you
bring
this
quiet-title
action,
what
proof
does
the
government
--
what
position
is
the
government
in,
in
that
circumstance
to
vindicate
any
claim
it
may
have
in
the
quiet-title
action
that
its
lien
still
attaches
to
the
property
which
you
now
say
has
by
reason
of
the
sale
has
been
released
from
mortgage.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let's
suppose
you're
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that's
suppose
you're
right
on
your
approach
to
it,
what
is
--
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
you
have
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you
perfected
under
california
procedures
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
method
by
which
you
could
acquire
the
title
free
of
any
junior
liens,
including
the
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
federal
statute?
it
is,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
stewart,
may
i
get
one
other
thing
clear
in
my
mind?
i
gather
that
if
the
government
had
filed
this
request
for
notice,
before
you
exercise
the
contract
rights,
now
the
government
would
have
participated
in
something,
what
would
that
something
have
been
in
the
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
they
challenged
the
validity
or
wanted
to
challenge
to
validity
of
the
trustee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
suppose
--
suppose
that
without
their
filing
a
request
for
notice,
you
had
decided
voluntarily
to
give
them
a
notice,
you
could
have
done
this
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
would
all
of
the
things
you've
just
described
have
occurred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
you
have
the
figure
showing
how
many
have
been
removed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
give
us
any
idea
of
the
percentage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
should
be
in
the
new
jersey
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
lock
the
barn
door,
and
(inaudible)
rest
of
the
horses,
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
--
is
the
government
in
a
habit
of
filing
a
tax
lien
so
that
a
mortgagee
which
has
to
be
or
the
case
maybe
will
know
that
there
is
an
outstanding
tax
lien
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
some
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
isn't
there
a
special
fact
that
if
you
don't
do
it
is
that
there's
another
one
of
these
types
of
in
special
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
do
you
concede
in
the
present
posture
of
these
facts
the
government
could
do
in
--
in
this
2410
proceeding
that
was
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
this
is
the
relief
which
had
you
been
made
party
to
that
the
original
proceeding,
whatever
that
proceeding
was
you
could
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
my
point
is
that
if
--
if
i
understand
it,
if
i
understand
mr.
stewart
had
notice
been
given
you
whether
pursuant
to
a
request
for
notice
or
otherwise
you
then
would
have
done
what
you're
now
asking
be
done
in
this
proceeding
namely
that
the
property
be
sold
under
some
proceeding
that
you
would
then
have
brought
in
the
california
courts,
isn't
that
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
my
hypothesis
is
that
--
if
notice
had
been
given
you
before
that
sale
under
contract,
what
would
you
then
have
done?
probably
you
say
bring
in
7403
act
in
the
federal
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
would
not
have
had
to
do
that.
i
take
it
you
could
have
gone
into
the
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
friedman
the
way
i
thought
is
that
as
the
bank
was
the
lender
here
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
do
some
figures.
suppose
the
bank
had
loaned
$25,000.00
and
the
government
junior
lien
was
for
$5,000.00.
they've
gone
through
this
proceeding
and
the
property
has
never
been
worth
more
than
$15,000.00.
do
i
now
understand
you
to
say
that
because
the
bank's
gone
through
this,
it
now
has
a
first
lien
on
the
property
which
means
that
the
bank
collect
--
or
the
government
collects
its
$5,000.00
out
of
the
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
thought
--
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
--
not
in
this
case
either.
if
this
case
now
goes
back,
if
you
prevail
and
this
goes
back
but
as
you
said
this
bank's
title
encumbered
with
the
government's
lien
nevertheless
accept
as
the
property
would
you
bring
more
than
the
bank's
original
loan
with
the
expense
and
everything
else
without
it
--
the
government
gets
nothing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
one
other
thing
so
if
this
gets
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you
yesterday,
the
discussion
you
and
i
had
yesterday.
i
gather
and
may
i
use
the
example
i
did
yesterday
the
foreclosure
of
the
suit
so
you've
got
my
own
state
policy
to
know
what
i'm
really
familiar
with
i
gather
is
in
a
new
jersey
foreclosure
procedure
the
government
is
given
notice
and
is
made
a
party
in
circumstances
like
this.
then
except
for
that
the
procedure
is
there's
the
notice
for
the
government
must
be
those
described
by
2410.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
government
will
have
the
right
to
remove
that
action
to
the
federal
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
they
desire
but
the
judicial
sale
which
eventually
then
satisfies
2410.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
--
and
where
they
have
different
forms
of
procedures
as
apparently
california
and
the
one
we
heard
yesterday,
pennsylvania
have,
are
not
there
the
lienholders
the
prior
lienholders
almost
forced
into
bringing
a
procedure
under
2410?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
bank
for
example
could
not
under
this
kind
of
contract
arrangement
any
longer
protect
its
rights
under
the
trust
deed
by
the
existing
procedures
for
that
it
would
have
to
bring
the
--
a
litigation
either
in
the
california
court
or
in
the
federal
court
to
accomplish
it,
would
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you're
right,
if
you're
are
right
in
this
case,
if
you're
right
in
this
case
can
mr.
stewart
any
longer
affect
titles
under
trust
deeds
for
his
client
and
no
matter
what
he
did
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it'll
mean
you'll
have
to
bring
a
suit
either
in
the
california
court
or
in
the
federal
district
court
if
he
is
not
to
follow
the
cumbersome
foreclosure
procedure
that
the
state
provides
and
such
a
suit
will
have
to
bring
--
be
one
under
2410,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
--
if
your
view
does
not
prevail,
getting
back
to
the
question
i
ask
mr.
friedman
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
your
only
alternative
in
the
future
in
cases
like
this
to
follow
that
cumbersome
three-year
procedure
you've
described?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
quite
follow
that.
now
this
--
this
cumbersome
procedure
i
gather
is
your
state
foreclosure
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
2410
doesn't
provide
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
does
it
take
three
years?
i
don't
follow
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
this
be
so
if
you
went
--
if
you
were
in
the
federal
court
out
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
i
know
you
have
to
--
to
move.
