justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
look
to
2410
might
take
over
most
of
the
mortgage
foreclosure
businesses
of
the
country,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
united
states
would
agree
that
in
the
state
court
and
under
the
state
procedure
its
lien
could
be
cut
off.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
in
pennsylvania,
is
that
a
choice,
you
have
to
choose,
you
can't
pursue
both?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
end
up
with
the
same
result
only
that
he
doesn't
have
any
(inaudible)
property.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
like
out
of
the
mortgage
property
or
any
property
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
judgment
(inaudible)
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
you
might
have
proceeded
--
have
proceeded
to
the
sheriff's
sale
and
bought
this
in
and
years
might
have
elapsed
before
the
united
states
have
to
learned
anything
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
equity
of
redemption
thereafter
or
anything
--
justice
potter
stewart
further
now
in
this
suit
to
quiet
title,
this
was
brought
under
section
2410,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right
what
you
understand
to
be
the
first
alternative
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
and
actual
notice
was
given
to
the
government.
justice
potter
stewart
that
suit
and
the
government
removed
it
to
the
federal
distinct
court.
justice
potter
stewart
had
notice
from
the
word
go
about
this
suit,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
does
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
don't
follow
that
at
all
because
--
that
is
i
don't
follow
your
conclusion
at
all
because
this
very
suit
was
brought
under
2410
in
a
suit
of
quiet
title
and
the
government
was
given
notice
and
yet
you
opposed
this
all
the
way,
this
is
what
your
--
there's
no
community
of
understanding
here.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
differ
with
mr.
stewart,
do
ask
to
what
the
california
law
is
with
respect
to
private
junior
lienholders?
