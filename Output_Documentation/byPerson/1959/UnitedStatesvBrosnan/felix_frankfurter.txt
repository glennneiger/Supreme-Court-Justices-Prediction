justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
to
whom
was
this
part
of
show
cause
against
the
united
states,
you
said
against
to
whom
was
that
issue
directed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
united
states
did
not
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
theory
that
they
couldn't
be
summoned
into
a
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
i
am
just
curious.
if
the
government
or
its
law
pursue
to
serve
with
any
legal
proceeding
to
which
they
need
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
make
a
response,
is
it
the
custom,
is
it
the
practice
or
--
to
disregard
it
entirely
or
make
some
suggestions
to
the
court
why
it
is
improper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
you
save
yourself
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
survival
of
the
lien?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
--
whether
--
if
suggestion
had
been
made
to
the
court
or
representation
made
to
the
court
that
you
were
--
that
the
motions
of
show
cause
must
fall,
would
there
have
been
power
on
the
part
of
the
state
court
to
amend
so
as
to
nunc
pro
tunc
bring
you
into
the
earlier
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
ever
doesn't
go
to
court
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
sell
it
from
the
--
from
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
do
i
understand
--
i
want
to
get
this
completely
into
my
head
as
it
goes
on.
forgive
me
if
i
ask
ignorant
or
stupid
questions.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
you
had
been
brought
in
before
the
foreclosure
said,
and
i
am
not
making
remotely
any
suggestion
about
this
case
or
the
fact
of
this
case.
but
then,
you
might
come
in
and
raise
all
sorts
of
question
as
to
the
relation
between
the
foreclosure
purchase
and
the
mortgage
--
and
the
mortgagee
or
whatnot?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
some
--
are
you
suggesting
some
such
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
talking
about
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
validity
or
the
--
the
purchase
price
that
--
which
it
was
bought
in,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
may
i
ask
as
that
your
brief
would
tell
us
that
i
am
reading.
may
i
ask
whether
the
answer
to
our
problem
as
to
the
survival
or
the
extermination
or
the
decapitation
of
the
--
or
the
evaporation
of
the
government
lien,
would
that
turn
on
what
the
local
law
is
as
to
the
nature
of
the
interest
--
of
a
mortgage
whether
it's
in
a
state
or
a
lien
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
to
the
question
we
are
now
before
would
vary
from
state
to
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
different
states
have
different
conceptions
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
whether
the
first
mortgage
would
completely
absorb
everything
that
the
mortgagor
has
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
which
a
junior,
so
called,
junior
lien
could
attach?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
going
to
--
i
am
very
rusty
on
that
almost
50
years
of
rust.
you
have
to
go
into
a
lot
of
niceties
of
property
law
in
different
states
for
the
answer
to
that
question,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
we're
construing
of
general
statute
and
the
government
is
--
this
is
a
general
position
of
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
interest
in
the
case
is
very
much
less
if
i
just
have
to
decide
into
the
obscurities
or
perhaps
shall
i
say
the
mysteries
of
the
pennsylvania
property
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
the
question
that
i
wanted
to
ask
to
carry
it
on
chief
justice's
question,
an
answer
to
--
and
you
said
it
originated
in
1931
but
i
want
to
know
if
that
on
the
original
origination
or
was
there
no
statutory
healing
with
the
subject
prior
to
1931?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
happened
before
1924,
the
united
states
had
an
interest
like
this,
how
would
it
assert
it
as
against
a
--
a
lien
prior
with
mortgage?
would
it
go
into
the
state
court?
what
would
it
do?
what
would
--
what
was
the
--
this
problem
didn't
begin
with
1931
or
1924,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
have.
uncle
sam
must
have
had
some
lien
prior
thereto
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
precise
liens
or
whatnot?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
was
still
an
uncle
sam
to
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
(inaudible)
bring
them
in
except
by
consent
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggests.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
provision?
i
have
been
looking
for
that
and
can't
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
2410?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
have
asked
these
questions
earlier.
forgive
me.
the
confession
of
judgment,
is
that
an
--
is
that
an
automatic
thing
or
is
that
a
proceeding
or
contested
and
adversary
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
admitted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
maybe
i
am
ahead
of
the
game,
but
would
you
say
that
that
proceeding
set
comes
within
2410
(a)
and
equivalent
of
tax
liens?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
requires
to
deprive
title
for
--
for
the
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
deprive
title,
is
it
for
the
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
earlier
answer,
would
you
make
some
clear,
if
i
may
say
so,
that
you
just
file
a
piece
of
paper
and
automatically,
there
is
a
judgement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
served
on
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
in
effect
--
would
it
be
unfair
or
inaccurate
to
go
to
the
next
part
in
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
you'll
help
me
to
follow
you
argument
if
you
are
to
answer
this
question.
do
you
conceive
that
proceeding
as
you
described
it
to
be
a
proceeding
--
a
proceeding
“for
the
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
foundation
of
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
already
have
it.
you
have
it
and
why
didn't
piece
of
paper
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you've
got
a
judgment
for
the
title,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
you
got
a
judgment
for
the
--
for
the
principal
amount,
which
is
defrauded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
i
must
trouble
you
some
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
notice
had
been
given,
suppose
that
it
served
this
--
what
do
you
call
this
piece
of
paper
mr.
jacob,
which
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
declaration.
suppose
you'd
serve
this
declaration
on
the
government,
could
the
government
then
come
in
and
contested
the
entry
of
a
judgment
on
to
follow
that
declaration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
didn't
know
that
you
filed
--
but
it
didn't
knows
you
filed
that
document
which
is
--
that
was
ex
parte.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
judgment
was
entered
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
--
where
could
it
contest
the
validity
of
that
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
open
any
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
mortgage
wasn't
executed
and
the
judgment
was
there
and
they
have
to
open
it
up.
i
am
not
saying
that
it's
a
legal
differences
to
2410.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
real
--
do
i
always
simplify
the
controversy
when
i
say
that
by
having
giving
notice
for
the
execution
of
judgment
entered
ex
parte,
you
brought
yourself
within
2410
(a).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
government
says
that
2410
was
satisfied
because
they
weren't
in
on
the
--
on
the
proceeding
which
resulted
in
the
entering
of
that
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
you
say
that
--
that
when
they
were
given
notice
of
the
execution
to
follow,
they
then
could've
come
up
--
come
in,
i
am
just
trying
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
then
come
--
could
have
come
in
and
your
court
of
common
plea
would
have
given
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
said
that
we
challenge
the
amount
of
the
judgement
as
i
understand
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that's
the
pennsylvania
law
might,
it
might
not
be
idaho
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
jacob,
may
i
insert
into
that,
sheriff's
sale
cut
off
the
lien
so
far
as
you
are
concerned.
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
saying
cut
off
all
property
interest
in
the
mortgagor
and
thereby
his
interest,
the
total
interest
of
the
mortgagor
went
into
the
purchaser
at
the
day
of
sale.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
hostile
to
the
perspective
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
they
flow
in
between
your
right
hand
and
your
lower
low
hand,
your
lower
left
hand
mr.
jacob.
they
say
that
wasn't
operating
your
illustration
because
in
between
where
debt
--
neglect
of
their
right
to
have
come
in
on
your
judgment
as
--
ascertainment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
where
the
difficulty
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
yes,
he
said
that,
but
i
didn't
know
that
he
abandoned
that.
you
can't
get
a
judgement
ex
parte
without
any
given
notice
to
the
united
states.
i
didn't
hear
him
abandon
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i've
got
to
see
what
is
--
what
is
the
question
that
he
wants
to
raise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
jacob
let
me
read
you
the
question
which
brought
this
case
here
and
with
your
entirety
and
insisting
that
the
government
should
argue
what
it
brought
here
and
the
basis
on
which
we
granted
the
certiorari.
whether
a
sheriff's
sale
of
real
property
and
execution
of
a
judgement
confessed
by
mortgagee
in
a
state
court
extinguishes
a
union
federal
tax
lien
on
the
property
where
the
united
states
have
not
been
joined
as
a
party
to
the
proceeding
assured
the
federal
statute.
until
i
am
corrected,
i
will
see
this
case
as
turning
on
what
is
meant
by
the
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
think
mr.
jacob
if
i
may
say
so,
my
brother
brennan
and
my
brother
stewart
calls
my
attention
to
your
statement
of
the
collection,
and
i
accept
that,
but
i
may
say
that
mr.
friedman
has
a
more
accurate
statement
as
i
understand
it.
whether
sheriff's
sale
et
cetera,
there
that's
the
junior
federal
tax
lien,
where
the
united
states
was
not
originally
made
as
a
defendant
in
the
confession
of
judgemental
proceeding
but
was
subsequently
joined
by
the
state
court
of
the
party
defendant
before
the
execution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
your
--
if
i
may
think
your
upper
and
(inaudible)
within
which
you
make
property
decline
with
the
government.
if
they
object
to
this
second
part
because
they
say
we
should
have
been
in
on
the
original
judgment
proceeding
and
you
yourself,
as
you
presented
the
question,
acknowledged
that
to
be
the
issue
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
mr.
friedman
has
any
time,
he
will
tell
me
what
he
did
or
didn't
abandon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what,
a
party
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
be
more
specific
since
there
are
several
proceedings
here.
there
was
a
proceeding
in
which
mr.
jacob
is
trying,
put
in
the
confession
of
judgment,
which
they
were
authorized
to
do
out
of
the
bond.
now,
do
you
mean
you
were
not
a
party
to
that
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
ab
initio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
--
was
the
second
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
disjunctive
quiet
title
or
i
haven't
yet
addressed
the
technical
connection
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
2410
for
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
that
you
ought
to
read
but
that
the
course
of
your
plan
that
i
had
in
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
the
problem
that
we
had
in
--
in
the
prior
case
or
the
foreclosure
of
those
mortgages
is
not
present
in
your
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
but
that
--
leave
that
out
for
the
moment.
go
for
the
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage,
that
is
not
the
present
in
your
case,
does
that
commission
not
have
to
be
satisfied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
that
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage,
then
they
would
have
the
same
problem
we
have
in
the
prior
case
namely
you
noticed
that
the
government
and
it's
present
in
the
procedure,
what
other
proceeding
may
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
have
to
get
in
to
the
--
the
protection
to
the
government
which
was
sought
to
be
accomplished
i
don't
know
what
it
is
by
the
--
for
the
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage,
the
consideration
which
require
the
government's
earliest
participation
in
any
aspect
of
the
proceeding
which
is
a
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage
would
be
equally
applicable
to
whatever
the
proceedings
maybe,
to
whatever
steps
there
may
be
to
what
eventually
is
a
quiet
quieting
the
title
proceeding.
in
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
words
--
in
order
words,
a
state
provision
for
the
change
of
property
interest
can't
make
a
difference
so
far
as
the
protection
of
the
government
is
concerned
in
being
in,
in
the
proceeding
from
the
very
beginning,
whatever
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
maybe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
described
as
to
quiet
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
have
to
go
through
the
same
old
procedure,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
the
government
might
have
to
be
a
participant
in
the
alternative
procedure
in
each
of
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
maybe
not.
it
was
the
same
as
any
other
junior
title
--
junior
lienholder,
maybe
not
and
there
maybe
a
different
view
of
the
government.
in
other
words
if
the
government
is
out
of
it,
the
state
has
large
powers
of
cutting
off
interest
or
deeming
it
unnecessary
to
give
even
notice
of
the
cutting
of
interest
if
the
consideration
that
satisfied
you
cut
through
if
you
cut
them
off
as
to
caps
later
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
is
--
the
question
is
whether
the
state
has
the
same
power
with
reference
to
--
if
junior
lienholder,
who
is
the
lienholder,
decided
you
are
a
lienholder
that
is
held
in
against
the
government
in
the
--
in
light
of
that
statute
depending
upon
its
construction
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
proceedings
during
the
--
i
am
not
sure
if
i
can
call
this
proceeding
you
can
correct
me,
in
proceeding
in
which
--
to
which
the
government
was
not
a
party
and
for
which
it
was
not
brought
before
the
determining
body,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
good
for
further
understanding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
would
have
taken
the
same
position
if
the
state
court
--
if
the
court
had
found
that
--
that
under
california
law
this
was
a
good
action
to
the
quiet
title
and
title
was
quieted,
wouldn't
you?
suppose
--
suppose
there
had
been
a
controlling
state
court
decision,
mr.
stewart
says
there
is,
and
suppose
the
federal
court
had
followed
the
state
court's
decision,
you
would
have
taken
that
you
would
still
be
here,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
the
facts
that
a
particular
decision
says
the
title
wasn't
quieted.
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
problem.
there
may
be
other
reasons
why
state
courts
are
interpreting
the
state
law,
you
may
not
allow
an
action
for
quiet
title.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
real
grievance
is
the
one
that
you've
stated
back.
it
couldn't
quiet
title.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
when
it
comes
into
the
court
to
quiet
title
that
is
merely
to
formalize
something
as
to
which
you
have
no
say
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
definitely
excuse
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
i'm
still
bothered
by
the
opaque
history
that
we
have
of
this
legislation
and
let
me
ask
you
this
specific
question.
prior
to
the
existence
of
2410
or
prior
to
the
act
of
1924,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
so
prior
to
that
no
statute
was
dealing
with
the
problem
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
california
could
have
created
its
own
property
law
cutting
off
junior
lienors
in
the
way
it
does
cut
them
off
and
that
do
they
apply
it
to
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
how
and
why
not
if
you
have
no
--
you
couldn't
--
now
you
can
go
out
with
this
statute,
what
would
you
have
resorted
to
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
when
you
say
you
don't
think
so,
you
mean
there
was
no
way
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
is
a
local
property
law
the
local
law
dealing
with
enforcement
of
lienor
rights,
or
mortgagee
rights,
or
mortgagor
rights
was
controlling
as
against
any
interest
of
that
united
states
could
have
said.
is
that
right?
the
local
law,
the
local
property
law
what
interest
were
conveyed
by
a
mortgage
whether
it
is
or
not
conveyed,
how
to
enforce
them,
apply
to
interest
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
prior
to
2410.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
couldn't
touch
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
did
some
--
usually
legislation
likes
that
is
a
consequence
of
some
--
some
decision
which
adversely
affect
somebody
that
some
acts
of
congress
solution,
is
that
what
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
usually
that's
the
way
--
but
i'm
not
saying
it
all
has
it
happened
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see
the
dark
ages,
doesn't
it?
in
1913
of
the
known
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
happened
in
those
dark
ages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
dollars
and
cents
it
isn't
worth
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
can
you
tell
that
it
is
or
it
isn't.
you
can't
have
law
depend
on
that
kind
of
a
guess
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
could
give
them
any
--
could
you
have
given
notice
to
these
administrative
procedures
to
proper
--
is
recorded,
where
is
it
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
county
clerk
at
recorder's
office,
could
you
--
suppose
you
have
and
tried
to
give
me
notice
we
got
a
--
we
are
filing
this.
so
there
it
is.
doesn't
it
become
effective
for
what
90
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you've
go
in
there
before
the
90
days
on
the
60th
day,
as
the
california
--
would
that
have
stopped
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
there's
no
statutory
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
--
not
your
worry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
i
have
it
the
chief
justice
is
understanding
of
what
mr.
stewart
told
us
or
told
me
in
regards
to
california
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand
you
mustn't
--
you
mustn't
belittle
their
claim
because
they
don't
lose
anything.
the
point
is
that
they
have
certain
interest
which
they
think
they
have
acquired
under
state
law
on
which
they
stand
and
the
right
to
the
property
is
also
--
maybe
allowed
by
state
law
and
that
maybe
a
right
which
is
what
they
are
asserting
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
claim.
all
i'm
saying
is
you
--
you
must
have
been
to
appear
that
the
act
--
mr.
stewart
here
is
representing
an
abstract
proposition
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
it.
this
all
depends
what
their
rights
were
on
--
what
their
rights
were
when
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stewart
is
going
to
say
yes
to
that
proposition
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you're
constructing
what
--
construing
what
the
federal
statute
says
as
any
question
exclusiveness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
sense
that
answer
of
yours
and
not
answer
your
problem
at
all
because
you
have
to
go
on
to
the
next
step
what
is
it
that
congress
has
provided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
how
big
your
argument
--
i
know
what
it
is.
all
i'm
saying
is
you're
speaking
--
maybe
answered
yes
i
believe
by
mr.
stewart
and
come
out
just
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
it
means
that
the
question
of
what
2410
means
and
what
it
is
saying
is
it's
quite
within
the
statute
is
whether
to
choose
to
quiet
title
etcetera,
etcetera
and
you
say
that
a
suit
to
quiet
title
can
--
can
start
with
the
answer
which
congress
only
to
have
answered
by
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
friedman
there
wouldn't
be
--
there
wouldn't
be
even
by
the
most
fanatic
of
the
finder
of
constitutional
question
in
anything
and
everything
in
the
law,
there
wouldn't
be
a
constitutional
issue
if
congress
tomorrow
but
is
there
if
you
taking
a
little
time
off
and
it
legislates
--
legislative
day
passed
a
statute
in
effect
that
the
state
law
and
state
procedure
governing
the
disposition
and
satisfaction
and
displacement
of
junior
lien
shall
apply
to
junior
lien
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
there
couldn't
be
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
only
question
we
have
here
is
to
interpret,
is
to
define
the
content
for
--
what
mr.
stewart
insists
on
quiet
--
proceeding
to
quiet
title,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
put
it
differently,
but
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
issue
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
because
this
is
an
honest
to
god
prior
to
title
proceeding
cutting
off
junior
lien
from
california,
it
governs
junior
liens
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
i
understand
that.
whether
this
is
a
quiet
title
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
2410,
you
accept
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
on
the
california
law
but
not
under
2410
under
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
authorized
to
file
a
suit
something
that
the
quiet
procedure
--
quiet
title
from
the
california
law
may
not
satisfy
the
requirement
implied
or
explicit
of
a
federal
statute
where
federal
liens
are
involved
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
of
course
if
the
united
states
can
not
file
a
quiet
--and
object
to
any
kind
of
piece
of
paper
being
filed
on
a
california
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
should
the
federal
court
go
through
a
procedure
--
same
procedure
between
the
central
and
local
authorities
even
though
the
government
has
an
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
it
--
alright
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
court
congestion?
