justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
issue
that
was
abandoned
mr.
friedman?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
--
what
issue
that
was
abandoned?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
won't
claiming
here
right
now
to
redeem
this
property
in
this
--
in
this
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
why
--
as
i
understand
it
mr.
friedman,
there
was
no
contest
by
the
government
over
the
validity
of
the
first
mortgage
lien
and
nothing
had
been
judged
that
affected
any
rights
that
a
special
execution
had
been
issued
but
had
been
stayed
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
you
in.
and
you
have
notice
and
the
statute
expressly
gives
you
a
right
to
redeem
from
a
sale
under
the
prior
lien.
how
--
why
you
couldn't
have
then
perfectly
well
gone
ahead
under
2410?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
friedman
i
am
still
having
some
(inaudible).
why
could
not
--
or
is
it,
you
tell
us,
could
the
government
have
waived
any
defect
in
the
timeliness
of
bringing
--
the
notice
upon
it
to
bring
it
in
to
this
case
and
have
sought
the
right
on
the
2410
(c)
to
redeem
within
a
year?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
mean
--
i
am
familiar
with
the
practice
that
you
are
making
in
the
statement
(inaudible)
depends
all
mortgages
foreclosures
by
a
judicial
sale.
and
the
special
execution
is
issued
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff,
publication
was
had
and
the
property
is
sold.
now,
that's
a
judicial
sale
and
there
is
a
creative
redemption
thereafter.
what
happens
in
the
case,
and
i
am
thinking
about,
which
is
an
18-month
statute.
what
here
i
should
turn
to
first,
under
the
government
statute,
the
government
have
the
right
to
the
first
12
months.
isn't
that
a
judicial
sale?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
state
(inaudible),
but
a
second
mortgage
lien
would
be
extinguished
even
though
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
am
coming
by
this,
could
you
answer
that?
i
know
you're
not
raising
the
question
here
about
a
right
to
redeem
under
2410,
but
from
my
mind
that's
still
in
this
--
tell
me,
how
much
you
tendered
the
amount
of
the
bid,
that's
$6,203.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
involves
only
court
costing
in
the
judicial
proceeding
and
ad
valorem
taxes
against
the
property,
and
didn't
involve
anything
for
application
on
the
mortgage
itself,
did
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
you
sought
to
redeem
simply
by
the
payment
of
the
$6,000
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
which
would
destroy
and
defeats
entirely
the
mortgagee's
interest
in
the
first
mortgage,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
so,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
wouldn't
you
in
equity
action
--
isn't
it
true
what
action
in
mind
--
what
resembles
that
the
amount
that
gets
equaled,
the
amount
of
judgment
plus
the
$6,000.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
the
redemption
price
that
you
have
to
pay
would
be
the
judgment
plus
the
$6,000.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
that
would
be
(inaudible),
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
not
--
to
see
if
i
understand.
what
you
really
do
is
file
a
plenary
suit
by
a
plaintiff
against
the
defendant.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
then
you
put
a
notice,
a
formal
entry
of
appearance,
consent
to
judgment
executed
by
the
defendant
and
he
waives
process
and
agrees
to
the
--
and
to
your
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
judgment
is
thereupon
entered.
just
as
no
process
had
been
issued
in
a
normal
case
and
an
adversary
trial
that
was
all
in
the
judgment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
from
that
judgment
special
execution
issues
for
the
sale
of
this
mortgaged
land.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
government
was
given
notice
and
asked
to
come
in.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
mr.
chief
justice
before
we
close
this
one
question?
is
this
clear
under
the
law
of
pennsylvania
that
a
redemption
where
it's
proper
to
be
been
made,
maybe
made
at
a
sum
equal
to
the
bid
at
the
sale
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
special
statute
mr.
stewart
that
you
referred
to
one
applicable
to
any
junior
lien
or
--
or
just
the
government?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
stewart
in
that
hypothesis,
sir.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
possible
to
make
this,
or
might
desire
to
convey
and
create
a
second
lien
junior
to
the
first
one?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
didn't
it
then
completely
encumbered
his
right
to
reacquire?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
does
it
convey
if
he
sells
he
conveys
subject
to
both
the
first
and
the
second
deed
of
trust?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
not,
isn't
that
to
fee?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
beg
your
pardon?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
equity
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
we,
what
for?
why
would
the
bank
give
--
you
--
i
understood
you
say
that
if
you
win
here
the
result
would
be
that
the
bank
would
own
the
property,
but
subject
to
your
lien.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
would
then
be
a
first
lien,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
means
that
the
bank
though
it's
foreclosed
at
the
first
lien
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
assumed
and
bound
itself
to
pay
the
second
one,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
don't
you
realize
that
what
that
means
is
that
the
bank's
act
in
foreclosing
is
admittedly
first
mortgaged
is
simply
to
release
it
so
far
as
the
government's
tax
lien
is
concerned,
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
what
is
the
first
lien
by
foreclosure
of
it
makes
the
second
tax
lien
of
the
government
a
first
one,
the
effect
is
to
satisfy
the
bank's
first
lien,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
where
did
the
bank
get
for
its
first
lien
which
is
foreclosed
in
this
way?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
your
position
that
this
exercise
of
the
power
to
sale
(inaudible)
and
what
it
did
not
satisfy
or
displace
any
liens.
now
they
have
to
go
back
and
start
all
over
under
section
7424
or
7403
to
foreclose,
is
that
your
idea?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it
didn't
eliminate
the
lien
foreclosed
and
all
other
liens?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
then
you
say
leaves
your
lien
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point?
supposing
the
conclusion
has
come
to
the
federal
statutes
do
not
prohibit
what
was
done
here,
what
is
your
position
at
that
point?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
this
federal
statute
does
not
make
this
as
an
exclusive
procedure
which
is
the
basis
of
your
argument.
have
you
got
a
constitutional
first
to
your
argument
then
that
if
the
state
law
governs
and
if
the
state
law
purports
to
take
away
the
government's
lien
hereby
extinguish
them
and
then
whatever
words
you
want
to
call
it,
that
--
that
violates
due
process
or
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
are
not
making
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
your
--
your
whole
position
as
it
stands
on
the
â€“
stems
from
your
argument
that
the
federal
statutes
are
the
exclusive
means
of
destroying
a
government
lien.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
all
there
is.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
say
that
the
procedure
implied
here
by
the
bank
was
alright
but
it
hasn't
any
substance
on
merits
as
such.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
do
admit
that
they
foreclosed
their
mortgage
--
the
bank
did
foreclose
its
mortgage
in
accordance
with
the
california
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that
mortgage
then
became
a
spent
instrument
once
that
power
of
sale
was
exercised,
didn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
say
that
while
you've
argued
that
your
lien
is
now
to
become
a
first
lien
you
don't
really
mean
that
in
answer
to
others
of
my
brothers,
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
now
if
you
can
how
the
bank's
going
about
to
get
its
money
without
first
paying
off
what
you
say
is
now
your
first
lien.
