mr.
william
l.
jacob
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
order
to
fully
appreciate
the
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves,
i
think
that
we're
going
to
have
to
refer
a
little
bit
to
the
testimony
and
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
are
peculiar
to
this
case,
and
as
such,
we
tried
it
on
that
basis.
apartments
owned
a
piece
of
a
property
which
say
is
purchased
from
berts
and
in
the
purchase
of
that
property
they
gave
back
a
mortgage
of
$45,000
in
1949.
now,
it
went
to
default
and
seven
years
later
a
foreclosure
was
had
on
that
mortgage.
accompanying
that
mortgage
was
a
judgment
bond.
the
bond
was
the
real
debt,
the
mortgage
is
collateral
for
the
debt
for
the
obligation.
the
plaintiff
in
that
writ
had
the
choice
of
remedy.
the
plaintiff
could
file,
enter
a
judgment
on
that
bond
or
could
institute
fieri
facias
proceeding
on
the
mortgage.
he
went
on
the
bond;
he
had
to
pursue
on
them
judgment
against
that
defendant,
meaning
that
he
had
a
judgment
against
anything
and
everything
that
that
defendant
owned.
if
he
went
on
the
fieri
facias
proceedings,
he
was
limited
and
restricted
to
the
piece
of
property
that
was
described
in
that
mortgage.
that
choice
of
remedy
is
a
very
valuable
asset
that
belongs
to
the
mortgagee.
this
plaintiff
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
no,
no.
it
would
be
quite
improper
and
confusing
on
the
record
to
have
to
do
both,
you
just
couldn't.
but
you
wind
up
the
same
result
because
you
wind
up
with
the
share
of
sale.
on
the
fieri
facias,
you
relieved
the
obligor
of
that
bond
from
any
personal
liability
and
you
limit
--
restrict
your
self
to
recovering
on
that
mortgage
against
the
mortgage
premises
on
them.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
the
terminal
result.
the
share
of
sale
is
identical.
the
same
officer
will
make
the
sale
and
for
the
same
amount
of
money.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
(inaudible)
mr.
william
l.
jacob
oh,
yes.
that's
the
--
that's
common
practice
in
pennsylvania
on
a
judgment
bond.
i
think
that's
quite
common
in
many,
many
states
of
the
union.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
and
it's
--
and
our
courts
have
said
that
that
is
just
the
same
as
if
a
suit
had
been
brought
in
(inaudible)
on
debt
and
a
judgment
recovery.
it's
just
a
shortcut
is
what
it
--
what
it
really
amounts
to
because
one
there
recognizes
abd
submits
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
and
in
fact,
that's
what
it
is.
now,
in
this
case,
that
procedure
was
adopted.
judgment
was
confessed.
and
then
before
the
sale
was
had,
the
proceedings
were
stated
and
a
petition
was
filed
in
the
common
pleas
court
and
a
rule
was
granted
on
the
united
states
government
in
compliance
with
2410
to
upraise
them
with
a
situation.
there
was
a
sheriff
sale
of
this
property
and
that
they
had
tax
liens
on
there
and
giving
--
and
asking
them
to
commend
an
answer
or
to
state
their
position.
and
that
was
done
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
2410.
we
waited
not
for
60
days
that
the
statute
requires.
we
waited
for
89
days
and
the
government
completely
ignored
that.
and
then
the
court
said,
“well,
you
go
ahead
and
sell.”
so
then,
we
went
ahead
and
sold.
and
then,
in
--
that
sell
was
made
on
january
3rd,
1956.
on
january
3rd,
1957,
the
government
recognizing
that
sale,
(inaudible)
out
to
these
purchasers
at
that
sale
and
tendered
them
$6,203
which
represented
only
the
amount
of
the
approximate
taxes
at
the
sheriff
sale.
these
men
had
in
that
property
over
$55,000
and
the
government
wanted
to
get
that
property
back
from
them
for
$6,200
and
some
and
the
testimony
here
will
bear
out
every
word
i
am
saying.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
it
is
not
a
contested
and
an
adversary
proceeding.
it
is
an
admitted
proceeding.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes,
that's
--
that
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
for
the
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
the
foreclosing
on
a
mortgage.
that's
how
accepted
procedure
in
pennsylvania
for
foreclosing
on
a
mortgage.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
no,
it
isn't
that
simple.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
you
file
what
is
generally
characterized
as
a
narr
or
a
declaration.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
a
narr,
n-a-r-r
or
a
declaration.
and
on
that,
you
set
forth
that
that
who
the
plaintiff
is
and
who
the
defendant
is
and
then
have
set
forth
your
allegation
of
default
and
make
reference
to
you
mortgage.
you
tie
in
that
judgment
with
your
mortgage,
so
that
there's
a
record
in
the
(inaudible)
office
of
that
judgment
and
a
cross
reference
made
to
the
mortgagor
as
recorded
over
in
the
reporter's
office.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that
is
not
necessarily
be
served
on
any
person.
and
then
from
there,
you
issue
your
execution,
your
writ
of
fieri
facias.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
it
--
it
could
very
properly
be
turned
down,
it
could
be
ex
parte,
until
the
purchaser
--
until
the
mortgagor
then
has
notice
of
it
through
posting
of
the
premises
and
the
advertisement
which
is
necessary
under
our
sheriff
selling.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
and
the
government
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes.
and
the
government
so
recognized
that.
the
government
so
recognized
that
because
the
government
filed
a
petition
saying
we
want
to
redeem
under
the
2410,
because
you
have
the
tittle.
why
would
they
try
to
buy
the
property
back
from
us
if
we
didn't
have
the
tittle?
mr.
william
l.
jacob
oh,
no,
no.
i
don't
get
title
a
by
that
piece
of
paper.
i
only
get
a
judgment
and
on
that
judgment,
i
have
to
issue
an
execution,
and
have
the
property
advertised
for
sale.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
no,
i
only
get
a
judgment.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
right.
i
get
a
judgment
for
the
amount
that's
stated
in
the
bond
and
the
amount
to
that
is
usually
double
the
amount
of
the
debt,
like
i
got
a
judgment
for
$90,000.
but
the
sheriff
would
be
directed
to
collect
the
exact
amount
that
is
due
on
that.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
right.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
right.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
exactly
by
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes.
and
i
have
so
referred
to
that
in
my
brief
to
give
you
authority
for
that.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
right.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes.
the
government
is
given
notice
before
any
violence
was
done
to
its
so-called
lien
at
all.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
go
ahead.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
this
declaration?
mr.
william
l.
jacob
the
government
had
a
right
to
commend
and
do
anything
that
it
wanted.
the
government
could
have
contested
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
well,
in
a
way,
but
that
was
ex
parte,
but
nothing
was
done
on
that.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
all,
just
the
judgment
entered,
which
does
no
harm
because
of
mortgage
was
entered
and
that
was
noticed
to
them.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
by
coming
in
the
rule
that
we
granted
and
served
upon
them.
they
could
have
come
right
into
our
common
pleas
court
and
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
open
it
up,
transfer
it
down
to
the
federal
court,
they
can
do
anything
that
they
wanted
with
it.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes.
but
our
judgment
didn't
mean
anything
because
we
already
had
a
mortgage
and
what
was
a
difference
is
whether
we
had
a
mortgage
or
whether
we
had
a
judgment.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
it
would
make
a
particle
of
difference.
but
the
government
recognized
the
fact
that
we
did
go
through
with
the
sheriff's
sale
and
that
they
had
a
right
to
redeem.
and
we
conceded
that
because
in
the
testimony
here,
these
purchasers
were
asked.
did
you
know
anything,
that
the
government
had
a
right
to
redeem
this.
yes.
and
did
you
--
what
--
what
happened?
well,
we
conceded
that
if
they
want
to
buy
the
property
back,
they
would
come
around
and
pay
us
what
we
had
in
it.
but
mark
you
this,
they
say,
it
was
january
3rd,
1956.
on
january
3rd,
1957
is
when
the
government
agent
came
around
and
offered
$6,200
and
some
dollars
and
not
to
both
of
the
purchasers
but
only
to
one.
now,
in
pennsylvania,
when
two
purchasers
that
acquire
a
title
of
the
property,
each
owns
and
then
divide
a
one
half
interest
or
tenants
in
common,
and
one
isn't
the
agent
for
the
other.
but
the
government
assumed
that
they
were.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes.
anytime
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
simply
by
coming
in
and
--
because
our
judgments
are
all
controlled
by
the
court
and
they
are
on
what
we
call
the
equitable
side
of
the
court,
not
on
the
legal
side.
and
anything
that's
addressed
to
the
conscience
of
the
court
can
be
set
forth
in
that
petition
to
open
that
judgement,
and
that
there
was
any
--
any
fraud
or
any
element
of
fraud
or
any
element
of
collusiveness,
that
could
be
set
forth
in
that
petition
there
by
the
government
and
testimony
would
have
to
be
taken
on
that
and
the
matter
would
be
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
i
doubt
it.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
$90,000.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
condition
upon
the
payment
of
just
the
exact
amount
that
was
due
on
that
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
the
bond
was
$90,000.
the
mortgage
is
$45,000.
seven
years
later,
they
still
load
43,000
some
hundred
dollars.
and
all
of
those
taxes.
so,
they're
about
$49,000
when
we
get
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
any
person
can
attack
any
judgment
in
the
--
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
who
has
any
interest
in
it
or
who
was
a
party
to
the
proceeding.
and
when
this
case
--
the
united
states
government
was
made
a
party
to
the
proceeding
by
the
order
of
our
court
because
we
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
page
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
oh,
yes.
but
before
any
execution
was
issued,
that
would
be
a
vain
thing
to
give
notice
to
the
united
states
government
and
say
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
i've
waited
a
year.”
well,
then,
it
wouldn't
do
any
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
anytime
at
all
after
it's
given
notice.
you
see
it
was
served
in
this
case
with
a
petition
to
show
cause
why
it
should
not
be
joined
to
the
party
defendant.
and
it
ignored
that
petition.
and
at
60
days
under
the
law
in
which
to
file
an
answer
to
it.
but
it
didn't
seem
fit
to
put
in
on
appearance,
it
didn't
seem
fit
to
answer
and
didn't
seem
fit
to
attend
the
sheriff's
sale.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
no
--
no,
but
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
true.
that
could
have
happened.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
true.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
our
contention
there.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
but
now
wait
a
minute.
they
--
they
have
abandoned
all
of
that
now.
they're
saying
they
are
staying
here,
and
they're
saying
we're
not
going
under
2410.
we're
going
under
7403,
and
under
7403,
we
say
that
we
have
a
right
to
have
that
property
sold
again
now
by
the
united
states
marshall.
that's
their
contention,
but
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
at
the
trial
of
this
case.
you
redirected
this
case,
we
didn't
tried
on
that
theory.
we
tried
our
case
on
the
theory
that
they
had
redeemed
this
property
that
we
were
bound
to
take
that
$6200
and
some,
so
i
showed
in
the
case
of
collins
versus
riggs
of
this
honorable
court
in
which
you
stated
by
clearly
that
if
one
wants
to
redeem,
he
has
to
make
the
other
party
whole.
and
they
didn't
do
that.
they
didn't
seem
fit
to
do
that.
and
our
testimony
showed
here
that
if
the
government
wanted
to
redeem
these
members
worthy
and
willing
to
give
them
back
the
property,
if
they
wanted
to
pay
the
$55,000
which
they
have
invested
in.
but
this
is
in
the
evidence.
and
now
i
am
arguing
my
case
from
the
--
from
the
evidence
as
produced
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
the
property.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
on
the
execution
sale,
nobody
did
honor.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
we
--
we
bought
it
in.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
writ
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
bought
it
in
for
the
cost
and
the
taxes.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
$6200
and
some
and
then
we
had
to
pay
$400
and
some
stamps
on
the
deed
before
we
could
get
a
deed
by
the
united
states
government
some
taxes
on
that,
stamps
on
the
deed
and
the
local
taxes
and
the
state
of
pennsylvania
taxes.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes,
because
that
was
the
amount
of
our
debt
interest
in
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
no.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
no.
what
they
want
to
do
is
have
this
court
--
this
is
so
noble
and
so
new
and
that
it's
shocking.
they
want
this
court
to
tell
the
united
states
marshall
to
sell
this
property
again.
now,
i
like
to
devote
a
little
of
my
time
here
to
the
reason
why
that
is
such
a
lie.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
no.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
the
government
--
the
government
has
--
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
equality
is
equity.
that
means
that
any
--
every
person
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
bid
on
that
property
and
you
had
equal
opportunity
to
come
in
and
bid
on
it.
if
these
people
paid
too
much
money
for
it,
that's
their
problem.
if
they
buy
it
for
less,
the
mortgagor
can't
object
to
it.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
the
lien
holder
had
his
day,
had
his
right
to
come
in
here.
he
was
given
his
60
--
given
89
days
in
which
to
come
in,
put
an
answer
or
attend
the
sheriff's
sale.
he
didn't
do
anything
at
all,
he
just
ignored
it
completely,
and
therefore
he's
out.
but
the
court
said
he
was
out
for
this
reason
that
they
only
tendered
an
insufficient
amount
of
money
to
get
back
this
property
and
they
did
it
on
the
last
day
of
the
year.
so
the
year
has
gone
by
now,
several
years
have
gone
by,
and
they
have
no
right
of
redemption.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
well,
that's
in
the
record
and
there's
no
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
yes,
that
was
the
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
well,
the
--
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
defense.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
at
any
time
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
anytime
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
right.
at
any
time
up
until
the
sheriff
knocks
that
down
and
when
they
do
--
when
the
sheriff
knocks
that
down
at
that
auction
sale,
then
their
rights
are
cut
off.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
true.
i
am
not
quoting
idaho
law.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
in
many,
many
instances
--
in
many
--
in
talking
with
other
lawyers,
they
have
followed
this
and
other
ones
have
just
ignored
it
entirely.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
meaning
by
that
that
here
--
and
this
gets
to
the
gist
of
my
argument.
a
deed
and
a
mortgage
is
a
property
right
and
that
property
right
is
governed
by
pennsylvania
law
and
pennsylvania
law
in
that
sphere
is
supreme.
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
the
case
erie
railroad
versus
tompkins.
property
rights
are
creatures
of
state
law
and
the
remedies
are
creatures
of
state
law.
and
in
this
case,
the
apartments
had
a
property
right.
it
was
a
defeasible
one,
because
they
had
a
mortgage
on
there
or
a
purchase
money
mortgage.
and
their
title
was
subject
to
being
defeated
when
they
defrauded
in
that
mortgage.
they
defrauded
in
that
mortgage
and
that
sheriff's
sale,
which
was
regular
in
every
respect,
that
sheriff's
sale
took
away
from
them
their
property
right
in
this
property.
7403
can
only
be
invoked
to
the
government
if
the
government
--
it
has
to
say
that
that
property
right
is
still
in
apartments
and
from
the
time
of
1701
to
this
day,
it's
a
law
of
pennsylvania
that
by
that
sheriff's
sale
all
rights
of
that
mortgagor
in
that
real
estate
are
cut
off.
now,
when
they're
cut
off,
then
the
lien
which
the
government
had
which
attached
to
that
property
right
to
give
it
any
sustenance
or
any
vitality
or
any
(inaudible),
it
was
cut
off
and
when
it
was
cut
off,
there
is
that
lien
hanging
in
there
in
a
vacuum
you
might
say.
but
we
don't
destroy
the
lien.
we
don't
extinguish
the
lien.
they
still
have
that
lien,
and
they
can
collect
it
from
those
people
that
they
have
to
look
through
another
asset.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
no,
that
isn't
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
right.
now,
we
have
to
be
technical
about
this
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
technical
subject.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
all
right.
now,
they
had
a
lien,
and
the
lien
rested
here
on
this
property
right.
we
take
away
that
property
right.
there
hangs
their
lien
but
their
property
right
is
gone.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
now
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
didn't
mr.
friedman
stand
here
and
tell
you
that
he
abandoned
his
argument
about
redemption?
mr.
william
l.
jacob
well,
he
has
no
--
he
can't
raise
that
issue
here
now.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
aren't
you
suppose
to
raise
here
what's
raised
in
the
court
below?
mr.
william
l.
jacob
here's
another
thing,
let
me
point
out
this
to
the
court
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
--
that
in
--
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
if
the
government
was
really
sincere
about
wanting
to
have
--
wanting
to
resell
this
property
and
thinking
that
they
had
--
they
argue
in
their
brief
talking
about
windfall.
well,
there
wasn't
one
since
--
until
the
evidence
produced
at
the
trial
of
this
case
to
determine
the
value
or
to
establish
the
value
of
this
real
estate.
now,
if
the
government
was
sincere
in
the
beginning
that
they
wanted
to
resell
this
in
order
to
recapture
their
money
out
of
it
and
pay
us
off,
wouldn't
they
have
established
the
value
of
the
real
estate?
mr.
william
l.
jacob
well,
that's
a
classical
question
but
it
isn't
based
on
the
facts
of
the
case
and
it
isn't
based
on
the
issues
that
were
developed
by
the
facts
in
this
case
that
--
that
developed
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
where
the
property
right
of
that
mortgagor
is
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
and
transferred
into
the
purchasers
of
that
real
estate.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
well,
on
the
record
that
i
have
it
here,
i
would
say
that
they
would.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that
they
would.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that
they
would
insure.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
they
would
insure.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
they
would
insure,
because
the
government
did
nothing
here.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
and
in
looking
into
this
and
looking
in
to
the
record,
i
think
our
title
companies
would
say
that
we
have
complied.
we
have
done
everything.
the
prime
purpose
of
that
2410
was
to
give
the
government
notice
and
can
they
say
that
they
didn't
get
notice
when
we
gave
them
or
everything
that
was
in
the
case?
mr.
william
l.
jacob
we
did
not
destroy
the
government's
lien.
i
want
that
distinctly
understood.
we
didn't
interfere
with
it.
we
didn't
touch
it.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
so
far
as
this
property
is
concerned,
our
property
stood
out
under
that
lien.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
i
think
we
could.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
but
in
order
to
--
and
my
argument
is
premised
on
that.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
now,
we
were
required
to
do.
we
--
we
went
to
that
--
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
right,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
but
isn't
that
rather
moot?
now
when
they
abandoned
their
proceedings
under
2410.
mr.
william
l.
jacob
i
thank
you
very
much.
