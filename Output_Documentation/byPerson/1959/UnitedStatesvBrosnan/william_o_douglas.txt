well,
that
--
that
might
be
true
in
many
states
where
they
would
have
to
bring
the
united
states
in
as
a
party,
but
you
have
to
the
consent
of
the
government
to
bring
them
in.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no.
so
this
takes
care
of
as
i
read
the
committee
reports
on
2410
that
it
would
take
care
of
that
situation
and
they
weren't
aiming
to
particularly
the
situation
for
the
government
lien
could
be
disposed
of
without
bringing
the
government
in.
