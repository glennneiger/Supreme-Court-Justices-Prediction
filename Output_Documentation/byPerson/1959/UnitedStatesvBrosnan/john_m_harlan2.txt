justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
point
anything
in
the
(inaudible)
history
of
the
statute
that
says
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
was
pointing
to
the
question.
you
really
derive
that
from
the
scheme
rather
than
anything
that
you
can
put
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
view,
could
you
have
proceeded
to
destroy
the
government's
lien
without
proceeding
under
2410
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
so
far
as
this
property
is
concerned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
have
obtained
the
property
ex
the
government's
lien
without
resorting
2410
under
your
view?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
understood
your
provision
was.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
your
--
i
thought
your
position
was
that
basically,
state
procedures
governed
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
in
proceedings
as
you
did
under
2410,
you
were
doing
something
more
than
the
government
--
than
you
were
required.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
i
understand
that
correctly?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
does
the
government
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
would
be
a
kind
of
a
telling
what
you
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
the
taxpayer
had
no
other
property;
it
would
be
extinction
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
citation
to
that
case,
mr.
stewart?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
in
your
supplemental
brief.
