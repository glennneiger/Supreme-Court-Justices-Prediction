mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
september
16,
1958,
more
than
a
year
ago,
taxicab
drivers
in
local
465
(inaudible)
a
strike
(inaudible)
yellow
taxicab
system.
and
as
part
of
the
strike
(inaudible)
to
picket
(inaudible)
control
the
premises
of
the
seattle
yellow
cab
garage
which
is
located
at
902
madison
street
in
the
city
of
seattle.
this
case
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
the
strike
and
picketing
which
has
taken
place.
incidentally,
the
strike
and
picketing
(inaudible)
and
this
case
is
here
by
a
petition
for
certiorari.
the
set
of
facts
in
the
case
are
these.
seattle
yellow
cab
system
is
composed
of
119
corporations.
118
corporations
are
engaged
into
the
business
of
operating
taxicabs.
usually,
one
corporation
operates
one
cab.
the
main
corporation
which
is
the
respondent
here,
the
yellow
cab
service
company
is
engaged
in
the
business
(inaudible)
the
activities
of
the
yellow
cab
corporation.
it
supplies
the
dispatching,
the
public
relations
and
advertising,
the
supervisory,
and
the
bookkeeping
services
for
the
other
corporations.
and,
together,
these
corporations
operate
the
yellow
cab
company
or
the
yellow
cab
system
in
the
city
of
seattle.
there
are
approximately
120
yellow
cabs
operating
on
the
streets
of
seattle
which
are
under
the
auspices
of
--
operate
under
the
auspices
of
this
system.
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
this
system
employed
approximately
160
employees.
about
10
of
these
employees
were
employed
as
dispatchers
by
the
service
corporation
and
the
remaining
150
employees
were
employed
to
drive
the
cabs,
and
all
of
these
employees
were
members
of
taxicab
drivers,
local
465.
back
in
1956,
the
union
and
the
--
the
group
of
corporations
began
the
collective
bargaining
contract
which
provided
(inaudible)
working
conditions
for
these
employees.
this
contract
ran
for
two
years
in
1958
(inaudible)
been
set
down
in
the
summer
or
early
fall
of
1958
and
it
(inaudible)
new
contract
but
these
negotiations
were
not
successful
and
they
(inaudible)
september
16,
1958,
the
union
called
a
strike
against
the
yellow
cab
system
and
placed
pickets
at
the
yellow
cab
garage.
as
soon
as
the
strike
was
called,
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service
stepped
into
the
picture
and
summoned
the
parties
to
a
--
to
a
meeting
at
the
offices
of
the
service
in
seattle,
but
this
meeting
was
not
successful
and
the
strike
continued.
and
then
a
few
days
later,
on
september
23rd,
1958,
the
service
corporation
filed
a
complaint
in
the
superior
court
for
king
county,
asking
that
--
that
the
strike
and
picketing
be
enjoined.
the
theory
of
this
complaint
was
that
the
service
corporation
was
willing
to
sign
a
contract
with
the
union
covering
dispatchers
only,
but
it
was
alleged
that
the
union
refused
to
sign
this
contract
(inaudible)
all
of
the
corporations
participated
in
the
(inaudible)
that
was
as
soon
as
the
corporation
(inaudible)
willingness
to
enter
into
this
contract,
there's
no
further
dispute.
(inaudible)
a
trial
was
held
in
early
october
for
(inaudible)
superior
court
of
king
county,
and
then,
a
trial
was
given
to
introduce
evidence
showing
(inaudible)
they
introduced
other
evidence
showing
that
the
cab
company
has
agreements
with
the
interstate
railroads
which
operate
into
seattle
by
the
terms
of
which
agreements,
yellow
cabs
are
used
to
transfer
passengers
from
the
train
depot
to
the
steamship
dock,
that
is
passengers
who
are
travelling
on
a
so-called
“through
ticket”.
we
also
introduced
evidence
showing
that
the
cab
company
had
agreements
with
the
airports,
with
the
railroad
stations,
and
with
the
steamship
dock,
by
which
it
had
the
exclusive
right
to
pick
up
passengers
who
were
arriving
at
those
terminals
and
that
the
cab
company
earned
substantial
amounts
of
money
from
the
exercise
of
these
franchise
or
concession
agreements.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
trial
court
ruled
that
the
service
corporation's
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
the
trial
court
held
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
and
which
the
employer
was
--
the
cab
system
is
engaged
in
(inaudible)
commerce
and
it
had
a
complaint
against
the
(inaudible)
as
soon
as
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
the
service
corporation
filed
an
original
mandamus
proceeding
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington
asking
the
supreme
court
to
compel
the
trial
court
to
take
jurisdiction.
and
after
(inaudible)
submitted,
the
trial
court
granted
that
writ.
the
trial
--
rather,
the
supreme
court
granted
that
writ
directed
to
the
trial
court.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
held
that
the
seattle
yellow
cab
system
was
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board
and
that
the
superior
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
had
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
lawfulness
of
the
strike
and
picketing.
and
then,
subsequently,
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
here
which
was
granted
by
this
court
in
june
1959.
now,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
take
jurisdiction
over
the
seattle
yellow
cab
system.
the
board
has
announced
that
it
will
assert
its
jurisdiction
over
any
taxicab
company
which
(inaudible)
of
more
than
$500,000.
and
the
evidence
indicates
that
this
cab
company
has
an
annual
gross
business
of
almost
$1.5
million
or
three
times
what
the
board
would
require.
now,
this
proposition
was
advanced
in
the
court
below.
the
court
was
told
that
the
labor
board
was
taking
jurisdiction
over
taxicab
companies
such
as
this
company,
citations
--
proper
citations
were
made,
and
so
forth.
but
the
court
below
said
that
this
was
irrelevant.
the
court
below
stated
the
test
to
be
whether
the
seattle
yellow
cab
system
was
“an
integral
part
of
interstate
commerce”.
and
then,
they
looked
at
the
record
and
they
noticed
that
the
seattle
yellow
cabs
do
not
operate
across
state
lines
anywhere,
and
then
they
concluded
that,
in
their
opinion,
the
seattle
yellow
cab
system
was
not
an
integral
part
of
commerce.
and
therefore,
the
board
had
no
jurisdiction
regardless
of
what
position
the
board
is
taking.
this
is
the
conclusion
of
the
court
below
which
we
believe
to
be
erroneous.
first
of
all,
we
believe
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
ample
evidence,
indicating
that
the
cab
company
is
actually
engaged
in
commerce.
and
now,
i'll
discuss
that
in
just
a
moment,
but
secondly
and
more
importantly,
this
--
the
test
applied
by
the
court
below
was
an
erroneous
test
because
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
jurisdiction
not
only
of
companies
which
are
actually
engaged
in
commerce
but
of
companies
whose
activities
will
affect
commerce.
and
the
(inaudible)
commerce
defined
the
statute
as
follows.
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
it's
probably
a
matter
of
terms,
your
honor.
there
are
119
separate
legal
corporations
which
together
operate,
in
our
opinion,
one
company.
the
seattle
yellow
cab
system
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
no,
it
supplies
the
dispatching
facilities
which
are
necessary
to
send
the
cabs
on
various
calls
and
so
forth,
then
it
supplies
bookkeeping
facilities
where
the
money
comes
in
once
a
week
and
the
service
corporation
has
bookkeepers
who
allocate
that
income
among
the
various
corporations.
the
service
corporation
also
supplies
advertising
and
public
relations
services.
and
it
has
a
--
the
service
corporation
employs
a
man
known
as
the
personnel
manager
and
he
hires
all
the
drivers
for
--
for
all
of
the
cabs,
he
disciplines
them,
he
has
authority
to
assign
them
to
shifts
and
so
forth.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
he
hires
them
for
the
individual
corporations.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
(inaudible)
all
the
corporations
that
we
had
in
1956
--
based
in
1956.
i
can
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
(inaudible)
keeping
in
mind
the
labor
board
cases
(inaudible)
has
held
in
a
similar
fashion.
(inaudible)
company
even
though
an
examination
may
be
for
two,
three,
four
or
more
separate
corporations.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
i'll
explain
that,
your
honor.
the
company's
contracts
in
these
franchises,
which
i
have
mentioned,
all
held
the
name
of
the
service
corporation.
that's
one
of
the
functions
of
the
service
corporation.
all
(inaudible)
which
all
of
the
cabs
(inaudible)
held
the
name
of
the
service
corporation
(inaudible)
and
the
service
corporation
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
yes,
there
is,
yes.
in
fact,
that's
why
the
trial
lasted
for
three
days
because
--
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
they
did
not
--
they
adopt
that
question,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
no,
i
said
the
trial
court.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
the
supreme
court
said,
assuming
that
it
is
one
company,
it
still
doesn't
affect
the
commerce.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
i
might
add
to
that,
that
that,
in
our
opinion,
would
also
be
a
question
for
the
labor
board
because
that
would
be
a
--
a
step
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
labor
board
has
jurisdiction.
but
even
though
it
was
for
the
labor
board,
the
trial
court
went
ahead
and
made
a
ruling
that
it
was
one
--
one
enterprise
or
one
company.
if
you
went
to
seattle
and
took
the
yellow
cab,
you
couldn't
tell
one
from
the
other,
they
just
have
a
number
on
them,
but
that
cab
belongs
to
one
individual
corporation.
i
was
explaining
to
the
court
about
the
transfer
arrangements
with
the
interstate
railroads.
they
work
in
this
fashion.
if
you
were
taking
a
trip
from
chicago
to,
say,
victoria,
british
columbia,
you
could
buy
a
ticket
in
chicago,
take
a
train
to
seattle.
and
upon
arrival
at
seattle,
you
could
walk
out
of
the
depot,
there'd
be
a
yellow
cab
there
at
a
certain
spot.
you
get
into
that
cab
and
you
take
part
of
your
ticket
and
give
it
to
the
cab
driver.
this
is
called
a
transfer
coupon.
but,
the
cab
driver
would
then
drive
you
to
the
canadian
pacific
steamship
dock
where
you
could
get
on
a
boat
and
go
to
victoria,
british
columbia,
all
on
the
same
ticket.
and,
these
transfer
arrangements,
we
believe,
are
similar
to
the
transfer
arrangements
which
exist
in
the
city
of
chicago
and
which
--
which
for
some
time
anyway,
had
been
handled
by
the
parmelee
company
where
you
transfer
from
one
railroad
station
to
another.
this
court
held,
in
the
case
of
chicago
versus
atchison,
topeka,
and
santa
fe
railroad
in
volume
357
u.s.,
that
those
services
of
the
parmelee
company
were
an
integral
part
of
interstate
commerce,
constituted
interstate
commerce.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
no,
i
was
going
to
add,
the
court
below
admitted
that
this
was
interstate
commerce.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
i
don't
know
what
he'll
do
now,
but
he
--
the
court
below
did
hold
that
this
was
interstate
commerce
but
then
they
dismissed
it
as
being
de
minimis.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
(inaudible)
in
terms
of
the
number
of
trips
that
were
made.
we
can
also
see
that
it's
not
(inaudible)
makes
1400
or
1500
trips
in
interstate
commerce
but
this
do
not
(inaudible)
further,
the
--
this
court
has
held
and
other
courts
held
that
the
(inaudible)
jurisdiction
is
not
(inaudible)
and
of
course
my
opponent
makes
a
--
quite
an
argument
that
this
is
only
to
a
certain
percentage
of
the
total
business.
that
argument
has
been
presented
and
rejected
before.
furthermore,
under
principles
announced
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
(inaudible)
this
held
that
the
board
was
(inaudible)
jurisdiction.
now,
additionally,
we
have
the
--
the
matter
of
these
franchise
or
concession
agreements
which
exist
with
the
airports,
the
railroads
and
the
steamship
dock.
these
agreements
provide
that
the
cab
company
will
maintain
adequate
service
at
the
terminals
to
service
incoming
passengers.
and
in
exchange
for
this
promise
on
the
part
of
the
cab
company,
the
terminals
give
the
yellow
cab
company
an
exclusive
monopoly
of
these
services.
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
yes,
your
honor
(inaudible)
to
service
incoming
passengers.
the
cab
companies
want
this
service
to
take
care
of
their
passengers.
so
then,
they
grant
to
--
to
the
cab
company
the
exclusive
right
to
occupy
a
certain
space
next
to
the
station.
then,
for
its
part,
the
cab
company
promises,
as
set
--
as
it's
set
out
in
paragraph
4.
the
cab
company
agrees
to
furnish
and
keep
an
attendance
at
said
station
during
the
hours
when
trains
arrive,
a
sufficient
number
of
taxicabs
in
charge
of
sober
and
courteous
drivers
to
serve
incoming
passengers
and
agrees
that
all
passengers
shall
be
transported
to
and
from
said
station
at
reasonable
rates
not
to
exceed
those
fixed
--
by
ordinance
in
the
city
of
seattle.
then,
the
last
paragraph
relates
to
the
authority
which
the
superintendent
of
the
station
has
over
the
individual
cabdrivers.
while
they're
working
there
(inaudible)
of
the
railroad
superintendent
because
(inaudible)
and
the
yellow
cab
company
realizes
more
than
(inaudible)
franchise
agreements.
we
believe
the
services
constitute
an
integral
part
of
interstate
commerce.
(inaudible)
this
is
part
of
interstate
commerce.
but
even
if
this
is
(inaudible)
even
if
this
is
not
a
part
of
commerce,
it
constitutes
commerce
in
itself.
nevertheless
(inaudible)
would
certainly
affect
our
(inaudible)
these
are
the
services
which
passengers
(inaudible)
there
were
hundred
thousand
of
passengers.
(inaudible)
interstate
passengers.
i
believe
my
point
(inaudible)
this
proposition
because
i
have
noticed
that
in
(inaudible)
and
also
in
the
petition
--
our
petition
to
(inaudible)
petition
for
certiorari,
my
opponent
says
that
(inaudible)
while
this
might
affect
commerce
(inaudible)
there
was
any
actual
interruption
of
commerce.
therefore,
the
board
would
have
no
jurisdiction.
i'm
talking
now
about
a
comment
made
at
the
bottom
of
page
57
and
at
the
top
of
page
58
of
respondent's
brief,
particularly
this
(inaudible)
referring
to
1956
when
these
cabs
were
sold
to
the
individual
corporations,
a
strike
might
well
have
happened
in
that
(inaudible)
the
owners
have
continued
to
drive
their
cabs.
now,
by
owners,
he's
referring
to
the
president
of
these
various
corporations
who
--
who
usually
drive
their
cab
one
shift
and
then
hire
somebody
to
drive
at
the
other
shift.
now,
this,
we
believe,
is
a
totally
inconsistent
position
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
because,
in
the
trial
court,
they
were
alleging
that
the
strike
was
causing
irreparable
damage.
in
fact,
in
the
court
below,
they
filed
an
affidavit,
that
is,
the
president
of
the
corporation
filed
an
affidavit
in
which
he
swore
that
if
the
picketing
continued,
we
would
drive
the
service
corporation
and
all
the
other
corporations
completely
out
of
business,
thereby
depriving
the
general
public
of
the
services
of
these
cabs.
and,
now,
in
this
court,
he
implies
that
the
strike
has
been
totally
ineffective
and
hasn't
hurt
their
business
at
all.
i
say
that
this
is
a
totally
inconsistent
position
on
the
part
of
the
respondent.
but
secondly
and
more
important
with
respect
to
the
law,
and
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief,
the
law
is
clear
that
the
board
does
not
have
to
show
an
actual
effect
upon
commerce
before
asserting
its
jurisdiction.
any
other
proposition
would
make
the
--
would
make
it
impossible
for
the
board
to
administer
the
act
because
an
employer
could
hire
strikebreakers
or
could
arrange
for
other
services
to
take
the
place
of
his
services
and
then
claim
that
the
strike
had
no
effect
upon
commerce.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
yes,
your
honor.
it's
been
going
on
since
september
16,
1958.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
won't
use
all
of
that
time,
but
i
do
feel
i
should
comment
now
on
this
--
this
narrow
issue
to
--
to
limit
--
the
narrow
issue
now
before
the
court
because
my
opponent
stated
clearly
that
he
would
concede
that
if
the
dispute
had
interfered
with
transportation
to
and
from
the
airport
and
so
forth,
then
the
board
would
clearly
have
jurisdiction.
so,
the
issue
then
is,
what
is
the
proper
test
for
the
board,
and
i
submit
that
the
proper
test
for
the
board
or
the
exercise
of
the
board's
jurisdiction
is
whether
a
dispute
could
reasonably
tend
to
affect
commerce
and
not
whether
a
dispute
has
actually
affected
commerce.
there
--
the
board
has
been
administering
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
24
to
25
years
now
and
this
question
has
come
up
many
times
before
the
board
and
no
--
no
board
case
has
ever
held
that
the
test
depends
upon
the
actual
impairment
of
congress.
no
court
case
has
ever
held
that
the
test
depends
upon
the
actual
impairment
of
congress
--
of
--
of
commerce.
and,
my
opponent
is
unable
to
cite
any
cases
in
support
of
this
somewhat
ingenious
argument.
there
had
been
cases
where
strikes
have
taken
--
taken
effect
for
several
months,
even
years,
and
where
the
employers
have
argued
that
there
was
no
effect
on
commerce,
and
therefore,
the
board
had
no
jurisdiction.
if
the
court
is
interested
in
some
of
those
cases,
and
these
are
not
cited
in
the
--
in
the
brief,
i
researched
this
matter
after
i
noticed
the
--
my
opponent
making
this
argument
in
his
answering
brief.
one
case
is
gibson
county
electric
membership
association,
65
n.l.r.b.
760.
another
case
is
n.l.r.b.
versus
henry
levaur,
that's
the
case
in
the
first
circuit,
115
f.2d
105.
the
--
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
pardon?
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
these
are
cases
where
a
strike
has
been
in
effect
for
some
time.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
and
--
yes,
and
where
the
employer
argued
that
because
there
was
no
showing
that
the
strike
actually
impaired
commerce,
that
the
board
had
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
115
f.2d
105.
mr.
richard
p.
donaldson
yes.
the
--
the
first
circuit
there
said
that
the
employer's
argument
had
absolutely
no
merit.
those
are
the
words
the
court
used.
now,
with
respect
to
the
facts
--
i
might
say,
before
going
to
the
facts
that
of
course,
that's
the
reason
we
didn't
put
in
any
evidence
on
this
because
it
was
--
it
isn't
required
as
a
test
of
the
board's
jurisdiction.
with
respect
to
the
facts,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
pages
38
and
39
of
the
printed
record
because
there,
you
will
find
a
sworn
affidavit
which
was
filed
in
the
court
below
by
the
president
of
the
service
corporation.
this
affidavit
was
filed
on
october
the
17th
when
they
were
attempting
to
get
a
writ
of
mandamus
from
the
court
below.
and,
you
will
read
several
paragraphs
of
this
--
of
this
affidavit
and
realize
that
the
service
corporation
was
pleading
that
it
was
being
tremendously
damaged
by
this
strike
and
picketing.
here
is
one
of
the
paragraphs.
“that
none
of
the
employees
of
any
of
the
118
independent
cab
corporations
have
reported
for
work
resulting
in
substantially
reduced
operations,
both
of
the
plaintiff-relater
and
of
the
said
118
corporations.”
next
paragraph.
“that
as
a
result
of
the
foregoing
considerable
delays
on
the
part
of
the
customers
seeking
cab
service,
have
resulted
to
the
damage
both
of
the
plaintiff-relater,
the
118
corporations,
and
the
general
public.”
and
lastly,
it
says
“the
time
is
of
the
very
essence
of
this
matter
since
continued
picketing
may
put
the
plaintiff-relater
and
all
of
the
cab
companies
out
of
existence,
thereby,
diminishing
competition
and
injuring
the
general
public.
so,
i
say,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
position
assumed
by
the
respondent
in
this
court
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
position
assumed
by
it
in
the
court
below
and
in
the
trial
court.
thank
you
very
much.
