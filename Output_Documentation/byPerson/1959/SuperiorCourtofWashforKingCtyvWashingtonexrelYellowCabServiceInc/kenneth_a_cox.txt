mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
apologize
for
(inaudible)
i've
arrived
--
acquired
a
new
cold
which
seems
to
have
settled
in
the
most
inconvenient
(inaudible)
substantially,
correctly
and
completely,
there
are
just
a
few
additional
points
i
would
like
to
make.
he
indicated
that
the
cabs
here
are
operated
by
118
separate
companies.
this
is
the
case
and,
in
most
instances,
these
corporations
operating
these
which
were
set
up
largely
for
licensing
purposes
are
owned
by
a
single
individual.
in
a
very
few
instances,
one
man
may
own
two
or
three
taxicabs.
by
and
large
however,
these
are
separately
held
by
--
by
individuals
who
were
formerly
members
of
petitioning
union
who
acquired
taxicabs
two
to
three
years
ago
now
and
became
independent
self-employed
businessmen
on
their
own.
these
men,
through
their
corporations,
own
yellow
cab
service,
which
is
the
only
party
here
before
the
court.
it
is
the
respondent--
the
true
respondent
in
interest
and
provides,
as
mr.
donaldson
has
indicated,
purely
local
dispatching
and
bookkeeping,
and
other
services
for
the
corporations
which
own
it.
stock
is
held
in
respondent
by
the
partners
who
formerly
owned
this
cab
business
but
who
liquidated
it
three
years
ago.
but
their
ownership
is
exercised
largely
for
maintenance
of
their
security
and
the
record
makes
clear
that
in
the
day
to
day
operations
of
this
taxicab
business
or
118
taxicab
businesses
in
fact,
the
decisions
made
are
those
of
the
owners
of
the
118
corporations.
now,
mr.
donaldson
was
in
error
in
suggesting
that
the
service
company
allocates
income.
this
is
not
the
case.
we
(inaudible)
although
the
trial
court
held
that
the
118
corporations
(inaudible)
operating
the
business.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
i
don't
think
the
relevance
is
substantial,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
it
is
simply
that
it
has
some
bearing
on
the
--
on
the
argument
as
to
whether
this
is
de
minimis
because
we
reduce
it
to
terms
of
what
this
means
actually
for
each
one
of
these
individual
cab
owners,
but
we
--
it
is
our
position
that,
regarded
in
either
way,
the
n.l.r.b.
would
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
that
was
our
position
before
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court,
however,
has
--
has
indicated
based
its
ruling
in
part
upon
the
feeling
that
they
were
to
be
treated
together.
now,
we
would
like
to
make
before
this
court
very
--
two
points
very
briefly
and
the
others
at
somewhat
greater
length.
the
two
brief
ones
are
that
it
is
as
important
as
ever
to
maintain
a
proper
balance
between
the
elements
of
our
federal
system
and,
secondly,
that
it
is
clear
in
the
law
and
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
congress
has
not
entrusted
to
congress,
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
regulation
of
all
aspects
of
the
labor
problem,
although
it
certainly,
we
concede
has
exercised
its
constitutional
authority
to
its
broadest
limits
in
terms
of
the
various
phrases
it
chooses
to
use
in
reaching
commerce.
the
commerce
clause
of
course
is
one
of
the
principal
sources
of
the
power
of
the
federal
government.
it
serves
the
very
useful
function
of
holding
the
nation's
(inaudible)
desirable
and
applaud
all
of
the
activities
of
the
federal
government
to
that
end.
but
like
many
other
good
ends,
uniformity
which
is
one
of
the
goals
thus
sought,
can
be
carried
too
far
and
can
reach
a
point
where
we
feel
it
poses
an
actual
threat
to
the
(inaudible)
of
this
relationship.
(inaudible)
maybe
this
was
a
power,
is
one
of
the
(inaudible)
as
to
the
states.
but
we
believe
this
case
presents
a
situation
at
the
other
extreme,
a
local
business,
quite
within
the
competence
of
the
local
courts
and
having
no
impact
upon
the
national
interest
to
justify
a
federal
intervention.
as
for
our
second
point,
we
have
cited
at
pages
31
and
33
of
our
brief
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
make
it
crystal
clear
that
congress
has
not
given
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
labor
field.
this
necessarily
means,
as
these
cases
also
state
that
much
authority
is
left
to
the
states,
although
this
has
to
be
spelled
out
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
it
is
our
contention
that
at
least
three
things,
however
are
clear.
first,
that
the
states,
by
virtue
of
the
constitution,
have
exclusive
power
over
labor
disputes
not
affecting
commerce
in
the
constitutional
sense.
secondly,
that
by
virtue
of
the
act
of
congress
itself,
it
has
chosen
to
make
only
certain
labor
management
conduct
subject
to
the
control
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
to
this
other
(inaudible)
nor
protected
by
the
federal
act.
and
thirdly,
that
by
virtue
of
the
management
(inaudible)
should
materially
its
interest,
otherwise
(inaudible)
exercised
in
the
constitution.
(inaudible)
made
perfectly
clear
not
only
in
its
grant
of
power
for
the
board
in
section
10
(a)
to
prevent
--
defined
unfair
labor
practices.
but
in
its
preliminary
declarations
and
findings
that
what
it
is
concerned
with
are
labor
relations
labor
disputes
and
practices
affecting
commerce
and
these
are
the
only
matters
entrusted
to
the
board.
this
is
the
clear
import
of
the
statutory
language
and
it
is
also
the
holding
of
this
course
in
the
santa
cruz
case,
the
fainblatt
case,
the
polish
alliance
case,
and
a
number
of
others.
now,
petitioners
speak
even
here,
and
in
their
brief
of
industries
affecting
commerce
and
of
business
(inaudible)
that
has
not
happened
here.
as
we
have
suggested,
none
of
respondent's
activities
are
in
commerce.
but
the
court
--
the
trial
court
felt
that
it
should
consider
the
activities
of
all
these
corporations
to
look
at
the
basis.
(inaudible)
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
(inaudible)
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
(inaudible)
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
(inaudible)
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
no.
you
view
this
in
terms
of
the
national
interest.
what
is
congress'
interest
in
interstate
commerce?
we
believe
that
congress'
interest
in
interstate
commerce
reaches
out
to
those
matters
of
substance
with
which
congress
should
be
concerned
but
that
there
is
not
involved
in
this
limited
segment
of
the
business
--
of
a
group
of
local
taxicab
companies
in
seattle,
washington,
that
essential
thing
which
congress
must
take
hold
of
and
must
handle
for
the
interest
of
the
people.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
the
dispatcher
is
employed
by
yellow
cab
service.
they
employ
10
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
well,
this
is
--
this
is
a
local
operation.
that
is
in
other
words,
they
--
they
maintain
a
--
a
radio
system
but
it
--
it
emits
a
signal
which
is
only
obtained
locally,
and
i
don't
think
(inaudible)
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
we
concede
if
the
strike
had
in
fact
(inaudible)
and
that
therefore,
(inaudible)
although
the
strike
is
called,
no
(inaudible)
where
interstate
passengers
are
to
be
found.
and,
that
the
strike
was
in
its
24th
day
when
the
record
was
closed
in
the
trial
court
and,
yet,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
any
single
passenger
was
inconvenienced
because
they
overlooked
the
fact
which
we
have
tried
to
make
clear,
that
these
are
driver-owned
cabs,
these
men
are
struck.
they
are
inconvenienced
but
they
are
making
an
effort,
a
successful
effort,
we
say
and
certainly,
the
record
does
not
contradict
this,
to
maintain
the
--
the
service
that
they
feel
they
owe
the
public.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
--
that
service
to
interstate
passengers
has
been
in
any
way
burdened
or
obstructed.
and
although
this
recourse
is
obviously
outside
the
record,
it
could
not
be
established
to
this
day,
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
later.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes,
if
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
if
--
if
they
were
established
on
this
record
that
interstate
travelers
had
been
inconvenienced.
now,
we
make
the
point
that
the
cases
which
petitioner
cite
here
and
they
are
good
cases
the
bradford
dyeing
case
holding
that
the
board
may
anticipate
to
prevent
burdens
on
commerce,
that
those
do
not
apply
where
by
the
acts
of
fortune
or
accidence,
the
strike
--
a
work
stoppage
has
actually
occurred.
here
(inaudible)
now,
and
this
is
true
both
as
to
what
we
regard
as
the
purely
local
adjunctive
functions
of
the
companies,
that
is
the
--
the
taking
of
people
to
the
railroad
stations
or
to
the
airport
and
from
these
terminals
and
no
interruption
is
shown
as
to
this
through
service,
the
linkage
service,
which
these
companies
provide.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
that
their
concern
was
something
that
has
led
--
had
led
to
a
labor
dispute.
now,
if
you're
to
measure
the
impact
of
a
labor
dispute
in
existence
then,
we
contend
that
you
are
dealing
with
actual
existing
demonstrable
facts
and
that
you
are
not
concerned
with
a
situation.
there
may
be,
for
instance,
a
claim
that
an
employer
has
wrongfully
discharged
an
employee
for
union
activity
and
no
strike
has
yet
taken
place.
if
the
court
can
foresee
reasonably
that
this
might
lead
to
a
strike
and
that
that
strike
would
clearly
burden
commerce,
then
it
is
perfectly
entitled
to
sustain
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
but
whereas
here,
there
was
an
opportunity
for
--
to
present
it,
to
prove
that
commerce
had
been
burdened
and
no
such
proof
is
adduced,
we
contend
that
there
is
a
total
failure
to
establish
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
claim
of
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
--
the
tending
to
leave
would
speak
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
that
is
the
potentiality
that
has
not
yet
resulted
in
a
work
stoppage
because
the
work
stoppage
is
the
ultimate
thing
that
can
happen.
beyond
that,
there
is
nothing
else
that
could
have
impact.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
i
would
think
that
if
the
strike
has
been
in
effect,
your
honor
and
if
the
statute
is
to
have
the
meaning,
the
--
the
--
that
the
word
“state,”
it
should
be
proved
that
it
has
in
fact
impaired
the
points
at
which
it
has
claimed
these
local
activities
have
a
bearing
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
no,
you
could
look
ahead
there,
your
honor,
because
that
is
an
entirely
different
thing.
you
can't
stockpile
cab
rides.
as
in
other
words,
either
the
cab
is
there
when
--
when
the
--
the
travelers
require
service
or
it
is
not.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
i
think
the
impact
of
a
strike
of
this
kind
is
almost
always
the
greatest
at
the
outset.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
i
think
it
would
be
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
we
submit
that
if
counsel
for
the
petitioners
felt
that
there
had
been
any
actual
burdening
on
commerce,
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
go
into
this
matter
and
to
make
proof.
now,
they
might
have
made
proof
that
as
it
suggested
for
instance
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
board,
they
might
have
proved
that
this
was
--
that
there
was
no
impairment
of
this
service
because
substitute
facilities
were
called
into
play.
but
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
this
again
is
speculation
that
if
that
is
why
no
one
was
inconvenienced,
it
should
have
been
proved.
our
--
our
theory
and
what
we
would
have
proved
if
this
issue
was
raised
was
that
those
people
were
being
serviced
by
yellow
cabs,
driven
by
their
owners,
driven
perhaps
somewhat
longer
hours
than
they
had
done
formerly,
but
still
being
driven
so
that
the
public
was
served.
now,
as
to
this
matter
of
the
admitted
interstate
commerce,
the
$1400,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
regarded
this
as
being
in
interstate
commerce
but
held
it
de
minimis.
as
--
as
we
suggest
in
the
brief,
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
fainblatt
case,
that
de
minimis
should
be
considered
in
determining
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
and
we
feel
that
it
should
be
applied
here
because,
otherwise,
we
find
it
hard
to
imagine
a
case
of
--
of
any
significance
even
locally,
which
would
not
involve
more
money
than
is
involved
here,
and
we
have
cited
the
freiburg
case
in
this
connection.
we
believe
the
further
ground
for
treating
this
amount
as
insufficient
to
invoke
the
board's
jurisdiction
is
contained
in
the
very
press
release
of
the
board
upon
which
petitioners
rely
so
heavily,
because
this
states
that
as
to
instrumentalities,
links,
and
channels
of
interstate
commerce,
the
board
will
take
jurisdiction
only
if
$50,000
a
year
of
gross
revenues
are
realized.
obviously
of
course,
the
sum
here
in
question
falls
far
below
that
and
therefore,
under
14
(c)
as
added
by
the
1959
amendments,
the
states
will
be
permitted
to
take
jurisdiction
of
that
much
interstate
commerce
because
the
board
has
stated
it
will
not
do
so.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
the
language
of
the
--
the
language
was
that
they
would
take
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
instrumentalities,
links,
and
channels
of
interstate
commerce
if
$50,000
is
derived
from
the
interstate
or
linkage
part
of
the
enterprise.
and
it
is
our
contention
of
course
that
it
is
not
proved
here.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
that
is
the
alternative
ground
on
which
we
argue
that
--
that
the
$50,000
figure,
we
argue
only
as
indicating
that
even
the
board
regards
$1400
as
de
minimis.
and
that
under
the
1959
amendments,
it
would
be
willing
to
concede
this
to
the
state
courts
if
this
were
the
only
factor.
now,
when
we
come
to
the
other,
we
concede
that
we
have
a
gross
volume
of
business
in
excess
of
the
$500,000
specified
by
the
board.
but
quite
obviously,
the
board,
by
announcing
its
jurisdictional
standards,
cannot
extend
its
authority
one
which
beyond
that
which
congress
has
given
it.
and
congress
has
said
that
it
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
prevent
unfair
labor
practices
affecting
commerce.
and
we
contend
that
this
strike
which
was
--
was
in
effect,
for
a
substantial
period
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
trial
court,
was
not
shown
to
have
affected
commerce,
an
actual
work
stoppage
which
was
effective,
as
the
record
shows,
to
prevent
the
dispatchers
of
respondent
and
the
employed
drivers
of
the
118
companies
from
going
to
work.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
we
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
it
is
--
it
has
affected
it
at
all,
the
commerce
that
they
are
entitled
to
reach
here.
that
is
if
--
if
we
get
beyond
the
de
minimis
point
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
if
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
--
if
we're
beyond
that,
then
we
say
that
all
we're
doing,
under
the
case
of
united
states
against
yellow
cab
company,
which
is
relied
on
by
the
state
supreme
court
and
which
is
good
authority
for
this
proposition,
that
all
of
this
other
business
is
a
local
business.
at
most,
it
could
be
said
to
affect
commerce.
we
concede
therefore,
that
a
strike
could
affect
commerce
if
it
were
shown
that
it
had
been
so
effective
that
the
service
to
interstate
travelers
was
impaired.
and
we
concede
that
this
might
well
have
been
the
case
prior
to
1956
when
this
company
was
liquidated.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
it
has
to
burden
or
obstruct
it.
that's
the
way
“affecting”
is
defined.
and
we
--
we
contend
that
“to
burden
or
to
obstruct”
must
mean
that
you
produce
some
observable
results
that
this
does
not
mean
--
if
it
--
it
does
not
mean
this,
then
in
every
case,
you
are
asked
simply
to
speculate
what
--
on
assumed
sets
of
circumstances,
if
something
happened,
what
might
happen
to
commerce.
now,
that
is
appropriate
where
the
preventive
jurisdiction
of
the
board
is
sought.
it
might
have
been
appropriate
at
one
stage
here.
it
is
not
appropriate
however,
when
there
has
been
sufficient
time
to
test
the
actual
impact
of
this
unfair
labor
practice
upon
commerce.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
it
is
our
position,
your
honor
that
this
simply
indicates
that
this
volume
of
business
would
be
brought
within
the
ambit
of
that
which
might
be
regarded
as
possibly
affecting
commerce.
it
makes
the
cab
companies
a
local
adjunct
to
interstate
commerce.
it
does
not
make
it,
as
for
instance,
i'm
sure
that
in
the
yellow
cab
company
case,
where
the
court
was
deciding
issues
raised
under
the
antitrust
laws
which
has
narrower
statutory
language,
what
they
held
was
that
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
this
linkage
function
between
the
terminals
was
a
conspiracy
in
interstate
commerce.
but
that
a
charge
of
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
local
service
even
though
many
of
those
companies
no
doubt
perhaps
had
such
arrangements
because
i'm
sure
that
many
of
the
stations
in
--
in
chicago
have
seen
the
wisdom
of
making
such
arrangements
as
they
have
in
other
areas.
that
all
this
does
is
to
indicate
more
clearly
perhaps
that
this
cab
company
is
performing
a
service
to
interstate
travel
which,
if
the
record
shows
to
have
been
impaired,
will
justify
the
intervention
of
the
national
board.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes,
it
would
have
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
we
contend
that,
as
between
this
(inaudible)
and
this
respondent
and,
because
they
seem
to
be
brought
here
by
virtue
of
circumstances,
the
118
separate
cab
companies.
as
between
these
contestants,
this
labor
dispute,
this
unfair
labor
practice
which
we
charge
and
claim
to
be
outside
the
purview
of
the
statute,
is
not
one
which
affects
commerce.
that,
if
it
had
affected
commerce,
if
this
language
is
to
be
given
any
practical
effect,
that
where
you
have
this
concurrence
of
an
actual
work
stoppage
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
the
absence
of
the
quite
common
preliminary
injunction
which
prevents
you
from
testing
the
impact
of
this
stoppage,
that
where
you
have
this,
that
unless
words
are
to
have
no
meaning,
the
court
must
look
at
what
actually
happened
to
determine
whether
this
is
a
labor
dispute
which
has
had
an
impact
upon
commerce,
which
has
affected
commerce
which
has
burdened
or
obstructed.
and
we
can
find
in
this
record
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
this
24-day-old
strike
had
in
any
way
burdened
or
obstructed
commerce.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes,
your
honor.
in
thought
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
nearly
a
year
and
a
half,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
although,
as
i
stated
a
while
ago,
i've
cited
the
record
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
we
represent
that
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
--
it
would
be
even
more
difficult
today
within
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes,
your
honor.
now,
we
submit
that,
although
24
days
is
not
perhaps
as
satisfactory
as
three
months,
that
it
provided
ample
time
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
or
a
year
and
a
half.
and
we
would
be
happy
to
try
that
issue
today
but
we
submit
that
there
was
time
in
the
nature
of
this
kind
of
an
operation
where
the
impact
of
the
strike
is
immediate.
there
is
not
any
backlog
or
raw
materials
on
which
people
who
continue
to
work
can
work.
there
are
only
cabs
which
can
be
driven
and
these
cabs
were
driven
and
they
were
driven
to
the
extent
necessary
to
provide
the
service.
we
could
have
proved
this
at
the
time
of
trial
if
it
had
been
required.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
record
makes
clear
that
the
effect
of
the
picketing
was
that
the
respondent's
10
dispatchers
did
not
come
to
work
and
that
the
employed
drivers
of
the
118
corporations
did
not
come
to
work.
they
didn't
come
to
work
the
1st
day
or
the
24th
day
or
any
day
in
between.
despite
that
fact,
the
record
also
shows
that
the
owners
took
over
the
dispatching
function,
that
the
owners
drove
their
cabs.
this
would
have
been
impossible
in
a
--
a
system
which
only
employ
drivers.
but,
here,
it
was
not
impossible.
they
--
they
maintained
the
service.
they
maintained
the
service
at
the
same
level
that
existed
prior
to
the
strike.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
we
don't
invite
any
speculation,
your
honor.
we
just
point
to
the
fact
that
there
were
--
the
petitioners
who
could
have
proved
these
things,
who
could
have
raised
these
issues
did
not
do
so.
that
if
they
had
felt
that
if
that
were
the
explanation,
they
could
have
offered
it
just
as
they
might
have
sought
to
prove
that
the
reason
that
interstate
travelers
were
not
inconvenienced
was
that
other
cab
companies
were
taking
over
the
service
and
there
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
that
would
not
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
well,
counsel
suggested
that
by
--
by
posing
the
possibility
of
sympathy
strikes.
this
is
simply
sheer
speculation
because
there
is
no
community
of
ownership.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
but
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
the
mere
fact
that
you
might
have
a
--
situations
each
local
and
each
in
itself,
not
affecting
commerce.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
we
say
that
it
is
so
local
and
so
unrelated
to
the
sort
of
interference
with
commerce
that
congress
had
in
mind.
that
was,
petitioners
had
been
totally
unable
to
prove
it.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
to
that
--
to
that,
your
honor,
we
would
answer
that
these
being
local
disputes,
the
courts
of
each
of
these
areas
would
work
out
these
matters
as
we
have
submitted
that
the
court
should
hear.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
no.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
no,
as
i
suggested,
your
honor.
if
--
if
for
instance,
the
issue
were
one
that
an
employer
had
wrongfully
discharged
a
man
for
union
activity
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
and
there
is
no
strike
yet.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
alright,
take
a
strike.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
it
is
our
position
that
if
there
is
a
strike,
that
if
the
strike
has
gone
on,
and
we'd
like
to
think
24
days
is
a
substantial
period
of
time
without
any
judicial
restraint,
that
the
first
interest
of
any
agency,
whether
it's
the
board
when
its
jurisdiction
is
invoked
or
the
local
court
when
it
is
asked
to
intervene,
its
first
interest
should
be,
now
that
we
have
an
actual
accomplished
fact,
a
work
stoppage
which
will
impose
the
ultimate
possible
impact
on
commerce,
has
there
been
an
impact
on
the
interstate
movement
of
goods
or
of
passengers
or
one
which
as
in
your
honor's
example,
will
surely
come
when
they
head
over
the
accident
of
having
had
some
raw
materials
on
hand.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
had
jurisdiction
if
it
could
have
been
convinced
over
our
proof
to
the
contrary
because
even
on
the
first
day
of
the
strike,
we
would
have
been
able
to
offer
some
evidence
that
the
owners
had
responded
to
this
situation
by
providing
through
their
own
efforts,
not
bringing
in
any
outsiders,
they
have
provided
whatever
was
necessary
to
maintain
the
interstate
service.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
no,
your
honor.
there
may
never
be
a
strike
and
if
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
the
first
day.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
we
would
--
we
would
say,
your
honor,
that,
at
that
point,
the
board
would
proceed
to
consider
the
possibilities
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
yes.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
we
--
we
would
concede
that,
in
any
case,
in
this
case
even.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
it
was
entire
and
we
did
not
object
on
the
grounds
of
irrelevance
to
the
proof
that
we
service
as
these
--
these
terminals.
this
is
all
relevant
to
the
issue.
if
--
if
this
had
been
presented
to
the
board
on
the
first
day
of
the
strike,
we
think
that
the
board
could
and
should
consider
the
reasonably
inferable
impact.
but
we
think
that
the
employer,
if
he
feels
that
his
labor
dispute
is
not
within
the
board's
jurisdiction
and
can
be
more
properly
handled
at
the
local
level,
if
he
can
prove,
based
on
something
about
this
first
day,
facts
which
will
raise
a
doubt
in
the
board's
mind
that
these
inferences
are
in
fact
reliable,
that
that
is
of
the
essence
of
this
whole
situation.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
if
the
board
felt
that
the
proof
given
by
the
employers
was
that
there
would
not
be
the
interruption
which
reasonable
inference
might
have
seem
to
indicate,
that
it
would
oust
them
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
kenneth
a.
cox
thank
you,
your
honor.
