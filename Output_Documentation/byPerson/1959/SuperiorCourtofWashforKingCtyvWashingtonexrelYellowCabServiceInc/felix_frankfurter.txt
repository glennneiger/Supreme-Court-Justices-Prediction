justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
(inaudible)
had
it
together
to
use
this
service
or
the
--
the
service
(inaudible)
what
--
what's
the
relevance
to
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
--
the
--
they
could
be
tested
as
what
the
service
company
does
and
not
what
the
customer's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
been
filed
for
lesser
amount
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
as
alone
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
do
the
statute
--
a
fellow
who
doesn't
know
when
to--
what
taxicab
he
can
get
in
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
station.
(inaudible)
new
york,
you
wouldn't
exclude
him
because
you're
a
part
of
the
taxicab
company
itself
from
the
service,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
this
--
suppose
that
was
taken
over
by
an
independent
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
there
were
such
inconvenience,
you
think
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
case
would
be
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
doesn't
the
various
of
places,
the
various
attractive
(inaudible)
commerce
imply
potentiality
and
not
actual
results?
justice
felix
frankfurter
having
read
or
tending
to
leave
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
tending
to
leave
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
potentiality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest
that
tending
to
leave
mean
the
kind
of
proof
that
you
suggest
is
necessary,
namely
that
in
fact,
and
i
want
a
fact
here,
i
couldn't
get
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cox,
may
i
put
this
to
you.
argument
affecting
commerce
is
in
its
very
nature
an
argumentative
criterion.
what
you're
arguing,
if
i
follow
you,
is
that,
as
against
argumentative
determination,
whether
this
has
or
has
not
affected
commerce,
there
has
been
a
test
of
that
and,
by
proof,
it
is
demonstrated
that
it
has
not
affected
commerce.
that
the
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
put
this
to
you.
as
i
understand
you,
the
record
deals
with
only
24
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
strike
has
lasted
how
many
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nearly
a
year
and
a
half.
i
could
understand
and
--
and
it's
an
interesting
argument
to
me,
i
could
follow
it
more
readily.
i
follow
it
--
i
follow
it
i
think
but
i
could
respond
to
it
more
sympathetically
if
we
had
a
record
in
which
an
undertaking
was
made
to
prove
by
substantial
or
impressive
evidence
that,
in
fact,
an
argumentative
conclusion
to
the
certain
interference
for
a
certain
conduct
would
affect
commerce.
in
fact,
appealing
from
speculation
to
experience,
experience
demonstrates
that
the
argument
is
wrong.
but
this
record
--
on
this
record,
we
are
restricted
to
24
days,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
understand
that.
but
the
record
on
which
one
must
act
in
applying
or
construing
or
--
or
getting
meaning
out
of
what
affects
commerce
which
to
me
does
express
the
potentiality.
we've
got
only
24
days.
that
in
24
days,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
affirmatively
to
show
that
any
interstate
traveler,
any
interstate
passenger
has
been
adversely
affected.
that
is
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
year
and
a
half.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
can't
just
--
my
imagination
is
an
equal
to
the
effect
of
this
--
with
this
(inaudible)
illegal
to
giving
some
reasons
why
they
might
not
have
been
some
interruption.
the
man
in
which
the
strike
--
when
the
strike
was
conducted,
the
response
of
the
owners
to
the
strike,
etcetera,
etcetera.
so
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
no
inconvenience
or
dislocation
for
the
passenger
doesn't
prove
that
there
is
--
that
this
is
outside
of
the
criterion
or
scope
of
what
potentially
may
have
affected
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
maybe
(inaudible)
that
they
put
up
--
put
up
with
difficulties
or
waiting
or
whatnot.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
the
argument
invites
a
lot
of
speculation
of
what
did
happen
in
24
days,
beyond
the
naked
fact
that
there
was
no
complaint
about
to
be
the
terms.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
take
care
of
that
local
situation,
whatever
it
may
have
been
in
(inaudible)
maybe
a
special
order
of
the
magistrate,
resourcefulness
or
whatnot.
that
doesn't
take
care
of
what
i
might
call
the
argument
or
the
consideration
before
we
(inaudible)
does
it?
that
this
may
be
a
local
instance
of
a
national
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
sympathy
but
(inaudible)
happening
in
detroit,
kalamazoo
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
local
in
the
limited
sense
and
to
indicate
it,
namely
not
that
it
had
no
relation
to
the
stream
or
whatever
figure
of
speech
you
choose
to
use,
inevitably
(inaudible)
that
it
had
a
--
your
argument
is
that
is
to
attenuate
it.
it's
too
--
too
local,
no
part
of
the
--
the
interstate
locality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
local
--
that
the
act
of
locality
may
be
repeated
mandatorily
making
it
more
than
local
than
nation
in
that
in
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
point
do
you
cite
these
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
point
do
you
cite
these
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
no

justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
of
the
first
circuit
case?
