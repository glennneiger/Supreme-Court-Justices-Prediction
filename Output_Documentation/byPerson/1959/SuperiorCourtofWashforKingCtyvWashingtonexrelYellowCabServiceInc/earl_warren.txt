the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
washington
for
king
county
et
al.,
petitioners,
versus
state
of
washington
on
the
relation
of
yellow
cab
service,
incorporated.
mr.
donaldson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
opinion,
can
you
dispose
of
this
one
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but
your
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
you
said
they
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
trial
court
did,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cox.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
plan
to
obstruct
--
and
for
23
days,
they
--
they
operated
from
stockpile
that
--
that
they
has
and
every
order
is
filled,
there's
been
no
interference
with
interstate
commerce
as
a
reality
up
to
that
time.
would
you
--
would
say
that
it's
not
within
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
nor
can
you
say
the
effect
of
a
--
of
a
strike,
23
days
after
it
starts,
it
might
--
the
end
of
a
certain
period,
that
situation
might
change.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
--
it
might
be
but
it
does
have
to
always
be
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
effect
of
those
contracts
that
mr.
donaldson
spoke
of
concerning
the
--
the
keeping
their
--
their
cabs
there
at
the
railroad
companies
and
the
superintendent
of
the
station
having
jurisdiction
over
them
and
so
forth
for
the
accommodation
of
interstate
passengers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
as
i
understand
you,
if
--
if
some
of
those
cabs
had
stopped
and
were
not
available
for
those
railroad
stations,
that
--
that
it
--
it
would
affect
commerce
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
would
have
jurisdiction.
the
board
would
have
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
fact
that
none
of
them
did
stop
running
under
this
particular
kind
of
picketing
that
they
engaged
in,
that
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cox,
would
you
--
would
your
argument
carry
us
far
as
to
say
that
in
any
--
any
business
that
merely
affects
commerce,
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
depends
upon
whether
there
actually
has
been
stoppage
of
--
of
commerce
by
a
strike
and
that
they
can't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
their
jurisdiction
doesn't
attach
until
there
has
been?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
a
strike?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
just
take
a
strike
like
we
have
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
that
--
suppose
the
board
wanted
to
exercise
jurisdiction
the
first
day
of
the
strike,
would
it
have
had
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
that
mean
that
the
board
must
determine
before
it
assumes
jurisdiction
whether
the
strike
is
to
be
successful
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
was
--
we
got
one
here,
the
one
we're
talking
about.
we
got
one
and
it's
the
first
day.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
the
first
day,
not
that
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
would,
but
could
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
talking
about
jurisdiction
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
power.
we're
not
talking
about
what
they
would
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
oust
the
board
of
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
that's
all.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
--
mr.
donaldson,
you
have
a
few
moments,
five
minutes,
i
think,
to
respond.
