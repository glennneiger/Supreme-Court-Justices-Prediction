mr.
julius
l.
schapira
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
presumably
under
provisions
of
section
3731
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
now
that
section
says
nothing
about
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
reviewing
a
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
that
section,
the
appeal
lies
directly
from
the
district
court
to
this
court
and
only
when
the
government
makes
a
mistake
and
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals,
then
the
court
of
appeals
takes
a
sort
of
conduit,
just
certifies
the
case
directly
to
this
court.
now,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
government
wanted
a
review
of
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
it
should
have
proceeded
by
writ
of
certiorari.
apparently,
they
thought
so
too
that
in
the
beginning
they
got
an
extension
of
time,
30
days
and
abandoned
the
idea
and
waited
until
the
case
was
certified
here.
now,
under
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
we
respectfully
submit
again
this
--
i
don't
know
how
this
case
got
here
for
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
determination.
if
this
court
should
take
jurisdiction
and
considered
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
may
i
submit
that
the
opinion
clearly
establishes
that
the
government's
position
was
sustained
an
absurd
result
would
be
accomplished.
we
would
have
a
situation
where
regulation
is
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
statute
as
appealable
to
the
united
states
supreme
court.
moreover,
as
is
pointed
out
in
that
opinion
before
1942
when
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
specific
jurisdiction
set
forth
in
3731,
an
appeal
could
have
taken
here
directly
from
the
district
court
where
a
determination
was
made
involving
the
construction
of
the
statute,
but
if
there
were
an
administrative
regulation
involved,
there
was
no
fault
to
take
an
appeal
because
there
was
no
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
may
i
respectfully
direct
to
your
honor's
attention
to
the
footnote
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
18
of
the
record?
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
it
says
that
an
appeal
such
as
this
would
ever
have
been
within
in
the
supreme
court's
exclusive
jurisdiction,
it
is
not,
since
that
court's
jurisdiction
remain
undiminished
when
jurisdiction
of
the
matters
not
appealable
to
it,
was
first
vested
in
the
courts
of
appeals
in
1942.
before
1942,
it
had
held
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
statute
and
regulation
for
purposes
of
appeal
would
have
made
dismissals
based
on
the
latter
wholly
unappealable
and
would
have
defeated
remedial
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
simply
submit
this
to
your
honor
as
part
of
the
opinion
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
well,
i
don't
know
off
hand
the
authority,
but
my
impression
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind
the
provisions
of
3731
which
confers
jurisdiction
on
this
court
in
these
specific
cases
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
and
that
same
section
if
your
honor
please
also
stated
that
the
cases
which
are
not
appealable
directly
to
united
states
supreme
court
shall
be
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
presume
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
meant,
when
it
made
this
footnote
that
if
the
cases
were
not
appealable
to
this
court,
then
where
will
it
go?
if
it
had
--
it
were
a
statute
--
if
it
were
not
a
statute
but
an
administrative
regulation,
that's
my
presumption
i
say
and
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
that
was
the
footnote
says.
but
if
that
would
happen,
of
course
the
assumption
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
is
that
a
regulation
is
tantamount
to
a
statute.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
don't
say
that,
that's
true
now
nor
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
true
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
said
they
would
have
untrue
in
19
--
before
1942
and
that
for
my
purpose
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
precisely,
that's
why
i
wasn't
particularly
concerned
anymore
than
i
was
concern
whether
this
--
whether
the
learned
discussion
of
this
situation
between
common
law
demurrer
and
a
special
plea
at
bar.
i
think
federal
rule
12
abolished
all
the
distinctions
and
provided
just
for
one
medium,
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that's
what
we
have
here,
a
motion
to
dismiss.
54
(c)
of
the
federal
rule
2
shows
that
there
is
no
longer
any
distinction
and
while
that
maybe
gratifying
and
academically
interesting,
i
don't
think
it
belongs
in
this
case.
i
might
say
in
passing
that
if
ever
there
was
a
case
of
de
minimus
i
think
this
is
one.
i
think
we
have
no
business
in
the
proliferation
of
this
court.
perhaps
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
well,
it
shouldn't
be
any
place
and
neither
the
fact
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
well,
may
i
--
may
i
respectfully
answer
that
directly
and
that's
this.
it's
my
--
my
considered
opinion
that
where
there
is
an
administrative
regulation
involved
and
a
court,
the
district
court
judge
makes
a
determination
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
for
whatever
reason
maybe
even
though
the
government
does
not
agree,
it
would
seem
to
me
be
more
just
fair
and
sent
to
me
cheaper
in
the
long
run
to
have
the
administrative
agency
correct
the
regulation
rather
than
to
take
an
appeal
of
any
court.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
well,
that's
true.
when
i
say
certainly
is
more
expedient
and
that's
why
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
hope
to
be
irrational
for
a
little
while.
in
any
event,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that,
that
would
have
been
the
--
well,
i'm
simply
saying
that
i
didn't
think
this
case
belong
to
this
court
as
i've
said
not
even
the
court
of
appeals.
these
people,
these
defendants
here
are
not
criminals.
they
are
small
businessmen
and
they
--
they
–
the
only
--
a
many
--
very
unique
expensive
violins
i
think
they
will
sell
down
as
a
piece.
and
they
had
a
few
workers
and
traditionally,
what
they
would
do,
they
would
put
their
name
on
top
of
the
label
that
they
--
they
found
in
the
violin
stamp
that's
made
in
germany.
but
may
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that,
these
facts
are
not
disputed
at
all.
that
the
--
the
stamp
made
in
germany
was
perfectly
legal
until
1953
and
when
an
act
of
congress
which
imposed
the
penalty
for
stamping
a
violin
imported
from
eastern
germany
made
in
germany.
the
treasury
regulation
51527
specifically
said
that
you
may
stamp
these
violins
made
in
germany.
now,
53210
comes
along
and
says
specifically
and
this
--
this
is
the
nub
of
the
thing
for
purposes
of
the
value
provisions
of
section
402
nowhere
that
this
treasury
decision
regulation
say
anything
about
1304
or
304
or
anything
at
all.
it
simply
says
for
the
purposes
of
value
and
then
it
goes
on
in
the
same
paragraph
and
it
says,
"insofar
as
this
ruling
on
value
results
in
any
change
of
practice.”
so,
the
emphasis
is
always
here
on
value.
since
the
tariff
act
had
a
dual
purpose,
one
to
determine
the
value
provisions
for
custom
purposes
and
the
other
for
general
consumption.
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
--
the
district
court
decision
was
sound
and
correct
when
they
found
that
this
particular
regulation
did
not
intend
to
enlarge
or
create
a
crime.
in
fact,
its
effect
as
stated
by
the
government,
if
the
government
position
is
correct,
is
to
create
a
crime
where
a
crime
was
not
there
before.
government
in
its
brief
has
gotten
into
political
phase
aspect
of
this
case
and
this
too,
i
earnestly
and
respectfully
submit,
it
is
not
the
reason
why
the
court
should
not
construe
this
regulation
any
other
way
because
it
is
conceivable
that
the
policy
of
the
government
was
not
to
advertise
to
the
whole
world
that
there
were
two
germanys.
it's
conceivable
that
the
policy
of
our
government
was
to
only
--
put
commercial
pressure
on
eastern
part
of
germany
and
no
other
and
this
is
conceivable
that
the
intention
of
the
draftsman
was
to
limit
himself
only
to
the
question
of
values
and
not
to
general
political
effects.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes,
sir.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
it's
the
latter.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
question
the
authority
of
treasury
to
issue
regulation.
we
don't
question
the
validity
of
the
statute.
what
we
say
simply
is
that
this
regulation
--
either
didn't
intend
to
create
the
crime
or
if
it
intended,
didn't
accomplish
it
because
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
no,
sir
the
statute
has
not
been
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes,
your
honor
except
this
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
again
if
that's
what
we're
--
we
are
thinking
of
now
is
that
you
cannot
construe
the
regulation
without
construing
the
statute.
the
regulation
itself
does
not
have
any
criminal
sanctions
or
any
sanctions
for
that
matter.
so,
that
a
construction
of
the
regulation
necessarily
involved
the
statute
there
is
nothing
into
regulation
that
says
it's
a
crime
to
do
anything.
so,
if
we
want
to
find
out
what
it
is,
that
is
prohibited
or
what
the
sanction
is,
we
have
to
go
to
1304
(e)
of
the
statute.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
no,
sir.
we
don't
question
the
authority
of
treasury
for
to
issue
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
precisely.
what
--
what
we
are
urging
is
that
the
statute
is
incomplete
because
the
statute
does
not
define
the
country
of
origin.
we
couldn't
possibly
know
whether
it
is
or
it
is
not
a
crime
and
yet
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
mean
the
statute
because
the
statute
simply
says
that
what
we
need
is
an
indication
of
the
country
of
origin
but
there
is
no
definition
in
the
statute
of
the
country
of
origin.
we
must
go
to
the
regulation
to
find
out
what
we
mean
by
country
of
origin.
well
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
before
1953
the
country
of
origin
was
germany.
after
1953
the
country
of
origin
was
germany-ussr.
that
wasn't
made
by
the
statute,
it
was
made
by
the
regulation.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
of
the
regulation,
but
at
the
same
time
we
cannot
divorce
the
regulation
from
the
statute
because
the
regulation
of
itself
hasn't
any
power.
it
has
any
sanction.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
well,
i
--
i'm
not
quite
sure?
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
make
it
directly
appealable
under
the
theory
that
the
regulation
is
tantamount
to
a
statute
within
the
provisions
of
3731.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
precisely.
well,
that's
the
additional
reasons
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes,
sir.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes,
sir.
we
concede
that
regulation
was
issued
pursuant
to
authority
and
was
not
authorized,
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
since
we
are
construing
the
regulation
for
criminal
purposes.
now,
i
want
direct
the
contention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
question
of
duty,
there
is
no
question
of
custom
here.
these
--
these
defendants
were
only
middlemen.
they
didn't
import,
they
didn't
export
and
i
--
i
wanted
to
say
this
that
with
all
due
difference,
the
government
was
wrong
when
it
said
in
the
last
page
of
its
brief
and
said
any
persons
in
the
import-export
business
would
understand
and
have
no
difficulty
in
applying.
the
record
shows
that
these
people
are
not
in
the
import
and
export
business,
they
didn't
know
anything
about
regulation
at
all
and
they
did
not
intentionally
that
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
no,
sir
because
the
statute
itself
does
not
define
the
country
of
origin.
all
it
says
is
that
an
importer
must
have
a
mark
showing
the
country
of
origin
and
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
there
is
no
sanction
under
the
regulation.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
precisely.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes,
sir.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
now,
i
can
only
repeat
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
that's
this.
i
think
that
the
government
missed
the
point
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
stated
that
this
case
is
appealable
directly
here,
one
because
it
involves
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
then
two
because
it
was
in
the
fact
the
motion
in
bar.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
determine
that
this
was
not
involving
a
construction
of
the
statute
and
therefore
was
not
appealable
directly
here.
then,
it
would
be
appealable
as
a
motion
in
bar
and
by
that
it
meant,
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
motion
is
called
as
long
the
end
result
is
to
say
regardless
to
exculpate
the
defendant
without
putting
him
in
jeopardy
and
that
was
the
nub
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
case.
so,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
what
it
is
called.
it's
the
effect
of
the
motion
and
if
this
motion
stands,
this
motion
--
the
order
of
the
motion
stands
then
of
course
the
defendants
are
clear.
there
is
no
longer
any
case
and
the
effect
is
for
the
motion
in
bar
and
therefore,
it's
appealable
directly
here
to
this
court
under
the
second
part.
in
other
words,
there
are
two
--
two
bases.
one
is
that
it
--
this
--
this
determination
by
the
district
court
involved
the
construction
of
the
statute
regulation
be
tantamount
to
a
statute
or
this
regulation
in
any
event
was
so
intertwined
with
the
statute
and
one
couldn't
construed
without
the
other
and
two,
that
even
if
it
isn't
such,
then
the
effect
of
the
dismissal
was
the
effect
of
the
motion
in
bar
and
therefore
comes
squarely
within
the
provisions
of
3731
that
where
there
is
a
dismissal
in
effect
the
motion
--
the
motion
in
bar
and
the
motion
in
bar,
the
appeal
lies
directly
to
this
court.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
certainly
agree
100%
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
my
only
--
my
only
preliminary
question
was
that
i
was
wondering
how
the
government
got
here
in
the
first
place?
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
precisely.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
you,
mr.
justice
signed
an
extension
of
time
gave
them
--
you
gave
them
30
days
to
file
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
then
they
abandoned
the
idea.
now,
they
got
sent
here
and
this
is
rather
curious
situation.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
appeal
would
be
dismissed
unless
the
government
requested
certification.
now,
the
government
didn't
request,
the
government
came
along
and
said
we
will
not
request
and
it
said
so
in
this
memorandum
which
is
part
of
the
record.
what
the
government
did
say
was
on
page
--
on
page
20
--
20
to
23
of
the
record.
the
government
had
submitted
a
memorandum
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
stating
that
it
will
not
request
that
if
the
court
wants
to,
it
may
certify
on
its
own
motion.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
yes.
i
know
that.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
now,
the
--
the
government
said
it
is
respectfully
suggested
that
the
transfer
should
be
on
the
court's
own
motion
rather
than
under
the
request
of
the
government.
it
was
so
there
--
i
was
puzzled
all
the
way
and
i
still
don't
know
how
the
government
got
here.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
in
any
event
--
i
again
--
may
i
again
if
the
court
pleases
address
this
political
aspect
of
this
--
this
regulation.
i
think
it
will
be
a
mistake.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
say
--
well,
i
could
--
this
court
has
power
but
i
say
that
the
case
rightfully
belongs
here.
i
agree
fully
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
appeal
should
have
been
taken
here
in
the
first
place
and
that
this
court
should
dispose
of
it
that
its
own
final
determination
should
be
made
here.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
on
the
merit
if
the
court
takes
jurisdiction
because
it
really
belong
--
the
government
should
have
appealed
directly
here
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
on
either
one.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
on
either
one.
i
--
i
should
just
--
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
rather
construing
the
regu
--
the
statute
narrowly
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
statute
and
the
administrative
regulation
in
the
first
place
and
in
this
particular
case
i
think
it
would
be
doubly
so
because
--
one
other
thing
as
far
as
the
defendants
are
concerned,
it
makes
a
very
little
difference
what
sends
them
to
jail,
whether
statutory
or
administration.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
--
that
to
make
a
distinction
between
this
statute
and
the
administrative
regulation
where
the
sanction
is
the
thing,
identical.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sanction
stems
from
this
statute
and
administrative
regulation
never
has
any
power
to
impose
a
criminal
sanction
without
congressional
act
so
that
--
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
haven't
for
this
reason,
if
your
honor
please
because
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
the
government
should
not
appeal
these
cases.[laughter]
i
think
--
i
think
the
simple
truth
is
that
the
draftsman
charged
with
drafting
the
regulations
should
be
more
careful
in
their
draftsmanship.
this
regulation
is
a
sloppy
job
if
i
may
say
so
and
vernacular
and
i
think
that's
a
shame
that
this
people,
poor
people
had
to
be
dragged
all
the
way
and
this
case
is
the
result
of
the
zealous
investigator
where
a
very
ambitious
young
--
assistant
united
stated
attorney
who
thought
that
this
was
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world,
it
isn't.
i'll
still
think
it's
the
de
minimus
if
ever
there
was
one.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
it
is
--
it
is.
i
agree
i
was
once
a
young
lawyer
too
and
i
too
thought
that
my
case
was
the
most
important
in
the
world,
but
then
again,
i
grew
older.[laughter]
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
think
is
unimportant
only
to
the
extent
that
it
imposes
on
this
court.
i
think
that
this
court
got
more
important
business
to
do.
it's
important
to
me
and
it's
important
to
my
clients.
i
don't
think
that
it's
important
to
have
a
determination
which
was
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
reviewed
by
this
court,
in
this
case.
now,
it
maybe
the
court
wants
to
know
what
to
do
with
the
administrative
regulations.
i
think
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
draft
it
properly
and
if
i
may
say
so
with
all
humility
--
due
humility,
i
have
something
to
do
with
drafting
regulations
when
i
was
working
for
the
government
and
i
--
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
i
was
concerned
with
to
make
sure
that
the
job
is
done
right
in
the
first
place.
mr.
julius
l.
schapira
i
agree
and
finally
in
closing
may
i
say
that
--
just
refer
this
court
to
the
(inaudible)
case
where
it
was
said
at
the
very
end
what
it
not
be
in
the
public
interest
as
well
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
this
petition
to
pronounce
this
vague
regulation
invalid.
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
that
an
interest
to
justice
this
petition
--
these
defendants
have
already
suffered
more
than
the
crime
that
they
have
charged
with
called
for.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
