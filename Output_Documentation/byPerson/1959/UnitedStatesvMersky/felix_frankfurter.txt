justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
the
government
construes
--
construed
out
order
of
bringing
this
case
here,
following
for
the
consideration
here
on
the
merits.
you
ask
us
to
(inaudible),
the
court
appealed
that
discloses
this
thing
on
a
--
jurisdictional
question
to
which
you
refer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
why,
assuming
jurisdiction
point,
goes
to
you
want
this
court
to
pass
on
to
substantive
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
because
we
postponed
the
jurisdictional
question
to
the
hearing
of
the
case
on
the
merit
and
the
government
thought
that
meant
that
we
will
consider
the
merit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
that
disposed
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
why
the
government
thinks
as
it's
evident
there
that
we
should
decide
the
merits
of
that
and
having
been
note
decision
below
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
argue
--
that's
why
you
ask?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
you
--
i
want
to
know
in
case
we're
with
you
on
the
--
the
case
--
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
is
the
government
position
that
we
should
--
we
should
send
the
case
back
or
dispose
of
the
merits
here
as
we
could
jurisdictionally,
couldn't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
government's
position
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
(inaudible)
i
just
wonder
what's
that
the
government
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
such
narrow
constructions,
that
one
was
to
generalize
the
instances
or
related
to
the
question
whether
the
district
court
passed
on
the
statute
whatever
the
statute
means
or
decided
the
matter
of
criminal
pleading
in
procedure
--
pleading
to
take
this?
in
other
words,
when
there
were
cases,
you'll
correct
me,
my
recollection
is
that
all
the
cases
where
that
difficulty
has
arisen
have
been
the
cases
where
the
district
court
had
been
a
little
muddy
of
all
cases
in
the
enabling
of
this
court
to
determine
whether
the
district
court
went
on
the
question
of
pleading
or
went
to
the
heart
of
the
invalidity
or
with
respect
to
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
passed
on
its
present
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
in
my
mind.
i
mean,
look
at
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
that
case
aside
all
the
cases
in
the
20
years
decided
here,
have
been
cases
of
pleading,
questions
of
pleading,
haven't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
in
general?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
the
--
that
--
i
am
addressing
myself
to
your
proper
consideration
of
the
etiquette
of
the
court
in
construing
strictly.
my
question
is
with
reference
strict,
with
reference
to
what
standard
or
what
subject
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
shed
any
light
from
me
at
all
in
this
statute
and
for
many
differences,
statute
includes
any
pronouncement
that
has
the
force
of
the
law,
take
the
cases
that
come
here
under
the
three-judge
court
statute,
the
case
in
which
mr.
justice
brandeis
quotes,
i
think
it
was
a
need
(inaudible)
opinion
but
is
not
been
the
law
of
this
court,
has
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
hasn't
been.
of
course
it
hasn't
been
decided
but
i'm
trying
to
get
guiding
lines
on
the
basis
on
which
i
should
decide
it.
and
your
remark
before
we
strictly
construe,
criminal
appeals
act
doesn't
help
me
either
slightly
because
the
basis
of
strict
construction
has
related
fundamentally
i
insist
on
the
question
and
i
look
at
foster,
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
pleading
or
not
or
whether
the
pleading
is
so
involved
with
construction
that
we
draw
it
back
on
pleading.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we've
also
considered
the
fact
when
we
couldn't
tell.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
couldn't
tell.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
am
very
sympathetic,
really
sympathetic
with
your
provision
that
this
--
this
court
should
construe
legislation
could
have
not
(inaudible)
but
it
doesn't
help
me
if
you
invoke
that
and
in
court
constantly
review
direct
--
on
direct
appeals
constructions
of
regulation
under
the
old
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
--
i
can't
just
think
it's
true
that
that
has
some
--
i
need
some
--
some
rational
lines
and
the
line
you
have
forthwith
is
very
sympathetic,
but
i
am
up
against
these
cases
that
come
here
constantly
when
you
take
the
opposite
to
the
statute
is
anything
that
is
admitted
by
authoritative
law
admitting
volumes
has
to
be
obeyed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court's
--
the
court
(inaudible)
looks
the
other
way,
fight
the
other
way
and
it
looks
to
be
the
other
way
on
--
and
now
is
it
of
the
enforceability,
the
criminal
enforceability
of
the
of
regulation.
your
argument
goes
under
ethan
and
what's
the
name
of
the
(inaudible)
on
the
regulation
(inaudible)
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
is
a
well
know,
primo
--
primo.
i
think
it's
primo
against
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
primo
(inaudible)
all
those
cases
beginning
with
this,
there
would
be
(inaudible)
each
is
particular
indicted
because
ethan
said,
unless
the
congress
specifically
said
violation
of
a
regulation
shall
be
(inaudible)
there
is
no
empowering
authority
to
regulate
regulations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there
was
a
statute
behind
the
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
moment
that
there
--
that
there
must
be
a
specific
statutory
provision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
he
basis
of
which
and
penally
enforce
the
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
statute
is
the
foundation
of
the
regulation
otherwise,
you
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
prosecute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
said
a
word
about
any
light
of
degree
from
the
enactment
of
the
original
act
of
1907.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
get
any
light
at
all?
if
you
want
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
existent
then
but
there
are
good
many.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
armour
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
simply
bet
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
because
if
this
court
--
if
no
direct
appeal
could
be
taken
to
it
from
the
construction,
from
the
decision
by
the
district
court
construing
the
regulation
one
way
of
that
in
another,
if
direct
appeal
couldn't
be
taken
to
this
court
because
it
did
not
constitute
a
construction
of
the
statute,
both
statute,
the
approval
of
appeal
that
then,
the
general
appealability
of
final
decision
by
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
come
into
operation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that,
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
1942
statute
--
assuming
this
court,
assuming
this
is
not
within
the
term
statute
of
the
1907
act
and
it's
just
to
inform,
(inaudible),
i
do
not
know
of
anything
that
wiped
out
the
appealability
of
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
any
find
decision
of
the
district
court.
there
maybe
such
an
--
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
--
if
it
doesn't
confer,
then
it
isn't
--
then
it
isn't
in
this
court
it
therefore
remains
a
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
understand
all
that.
but
i
don't
understand
the
--
the
dilemma
which
you
present
(inaudible)
that
if
you
--
to
come
here,
you
can't
go
any
where,
that
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
1959
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
agree
--
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
to
be
at
some
place
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
neither
you
or
i
can
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
rational
world,
that
was
really
happening.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
unlike
the
foster
case
where
you
have
the
(inaudible)
of
the
statute
in
order
to
determine
the
ultra
or
intra
varies
of
the
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
such
question
about
it
around
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
statute
as
the
authorizing,
penalizing
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
(inaudible)
as
an
offense
under
the
regulations
are
referring
to
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
have
to
go
to
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
mr.
schapira,
may
ask
that,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
you
gain
concluding
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
certifying
the
case
to
this
court,
this
case
is
therefore
properly
in
this
court
and
this
court
must
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
construction
regulation,
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
you
said
something
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
chief
--
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
government
having
requested
certification
would
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
then
were
this
court
could
have
certified,
if
they
bring
it
to
supreme
court.
i'm
glad
they
think
the
(inaudible)
supreme
court
might
have
been
--
might
have
been
disqualify.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
and
gave
you
the
perfect
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
shown
no
concern
for
that
which
is
mr.
grimm's
chief
concern
--
concern
namely
that
this
court
should
not
--
should
be
saved
for
having
cases
come
here
during
regulation
which
it
should
be
expected
for
construing
statute,
you
show
no
concern
for
us
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
every
young
lawyer
thinks
same
have
to
engage
the
most
important,
the
very
good
thing
he
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
have
some
kind
of
suggestion
where
by
one
to
secure
that,
it
will
have
that
you
might
extend
your
interest
to
appeal
to
where
they
--[laughter]
