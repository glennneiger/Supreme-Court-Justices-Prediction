mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
an
undecided
question
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
18
u.s.c.
3731,
regarding
jurisdiction
over
the
appeal.
if
the
merits
are
reached,
the
question
is
one
of
the
constructions
to
be
place
upon
certain
customs
regulations
published
by
the
treasury
department.
in
this
case,
appellees
were
charge
by
information
with
violating
19
u.s.c.
1304
which
requires
that
articles
imported
from
foreign
land
be
marked
with
their
country
of
origin
and
that
such
marking
be
maintained
until
sale
of
the
article
to
ultimate
purchaser.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
information
on
the
ground
that
a
treasury
decision
requiring
that
articles
imported
from
east
germany
be
marked
“germany
soviet
occupied”
do
not
require
such
making
for
the
purposes
of
1304,
that
is
the
marking
statute.
on
appeal
by
the
government,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
appeal
should
have
been
taken
to
this
court
in
the
first
instance
since
it
regarded
the
construction
of
the
administrative
regulation
as
the
construction
of
a
statute
within
the
meaning
of
criminal
appeals
act
and
concluded
that
in
any
event,
the
order
sustaining
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
an
order
sustaining
a
motion
in
bar.
it
therefore
certified
the
case
to
this
court.
the
government
thinks
this
case
was
properly
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeal
in
the
first
instance.
cases
of
course
coming
here
by
certificate
are
fairly
unusual.
if
i
may
go
rather
quickly
over
the
operative
facts,
the
information
in
this
case
alleged
that
between
august
1956
and
march
1957,
the
appellees
had
purchase
a
certain
violins
from
importers.
now,
at
the
time
they
purchased
these
violins,
the
violins
had
been
imported
from
east
germany
and
they
bore
label
showing
that
they
had
been
imported
from
germany,
soviet
occupied
or
u.s.s.r.
occupied.
it
was
the
allegation
in
the
information
that
the
appellees
had
obliterated
and
removed
these
labels
and
there
after
sold
the
violins
to
someone
who
was
not
an
ultimate
purchaser
without
disclosing
the
fact
that
they
have
been
imported
from
east
germany
and
of
course,
there
was
a
theory
of
this
information
that
this
act
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
intentionally
done
was
a
violation
of
the
marking
statute.
now,
the
statute
itself
requires
that
every
article
of
foreign
origin
be
marked
with
the
name
of
the
country
of
origin
and
the
country
of
origin,
that
phrase
has
been
defined
by
appropriate
regulation
as
political
entity
known
as
a
nation.
here,
let
me
say
of
course
that
the
marking
statute
provides
that
the
secretary
of
treasury
may
issue
regulations
establishing
just
what
marking
maybe
put
on
various
imported
articles
to
indicate
specific
country
from
which
it
came.
so,
as
i
said
at
the
first
regulation
which
is
our
concern
here,
defines
country
of
origin
as
a
political
entity
known
as
a
nation.
immediately
or
shortly
after
world
war
ii
in
1946,
the
treasury
department
permitted
articles
manufactured
in
all
four
zones
of
germany
to
be
marked
as
“made
in
germany.”
and
this
regulation
further
provided
that
the
specific
zone
of
manufacture
could
be
indicated
if
thought
desirable
by
the
importer.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
we
do
not
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
oh,
no
your
honor,
oh,
no.
it
simply
that
the
--
as
we
say
in
regard
to
the
questions
presented,
we
first
set
out
--
what
we
regarded
to
be
the
question
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
and
we
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
if
we
succeed
--
if
we
succeed
there.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
sir,
then
i
have
--
i
have
misled
you,
your
honor
because
we
do
not
expect
you
to
pass
upon
the
merits.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
--
if
we
prevail
upon
the
jurisdictional
issue.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
but
if
--
if
you
--
if
we
lose
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
then,
this
court
will
have
to
pass
on
the
merit.
in
other
words
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
the
government's
position
is
that,
under
the
literal
language
of
criminal
appeals
act,
the
case
should
properly
be
disposed
of
by
returning
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
decision
on
the
merit.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
as
we
--
as
we
say
in
simply
setting
out
the
questions
presented
if
the
court
should
hold
that
appeal
is
properly
before
it
the
question
presented
are.
to
a
--
right
now
--
right
now,
i'm
stating
these
facts
touching
upon
the
merits
primarily
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
in
disposing
of
this
information
construed
only
the
regulation,
only
the
administrative
regulation.
and
so,
to
pass
to
the
treasury
regulation
of
1953,
that
regulation
in
it's
title
stated
that
--
that
it
was
intended
to
deal
with
tariff
status,
customs
evaluation
and
marking
to
indicate
the
country
of
origin.
and
the
first
paragraph
dealt
with
tariff
status.
the
second
paragraph
began
for
the
purposes
of
value
provisions
of
section
402
which
is
a
customs
provision
within
the
tariff
act.
and
the
third
paragraph
simply
provided
that
articles
made
in
western
germany
shall
continue
to
be
marked
to
indicate
germany
as
the
country
of
origin,
but
that
goods
from
eastern
germany
shall
be
marked
to
indicate
germany
soviet
occupied
as
a
country
of
origin.
now,
on
dismissing
the
information
that
this
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
sir,
treasury
--
treasury
decisions
are
published
separately
in
bound
volumes.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
it's
called
by
that
name,
but
it
is
nonetheless
an
administrative
regulation
of
the
treasury
department.
it
has
--
treasury
decision
have
been
the
subject
of
opinion
by
this
court
before.
one
of
the
various
earliest
cases
by
this
court
dealing
with
the
interpretation
of
--
or
dealing
the
administrative
regulations,
united
states
versus
ethan
involved
a
treasury
decision.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
that
is
its
effective
moment
of
the
date
of
the
actual
minute
upon
which
it
is
filed
with
the
division
of
federal
register.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
no,
publishment
in
the
federal
register
is
not
essential
to
its
binding
effect.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
no,
sir.
it
was
published
as
i
say
in
bound
volume
and
then
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that's
right.
and
it's
disseminated
to
collectors
of
customs
through
the
use
of
periodic
bulletin,
weekly
bulletin
sent
to
a
commissioner
of
the
customs
and
to
persons
interested
in
this
field.
in
dismissing
the
information,
the
district
court
considered
the
statute
and
these
regulations
and
also
an
affidavit
from
defense
counsel
to
the
effect
that
appellees
have
marked
the
offending
violins
as
“made
in
germany.”
the
court
concluded
that
regulations
require
different
marking
on
articles
from
east
and
west
germany
only
for
the
purposes
of
imposing
the
proper
duty
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
implementing
the
marking
statute
1304.
in
other
words,
it
read
the
restriction
contained
in
the
second
paragraph
of
that
treasury
decision
on
page
6
and
7.
it
read
that
restriction
in
the
second
paragraph
for
the
purposes
of
the
value
provisions
of
section
402
into
the
third
paragraph
of
the
decision
as
well.
that
is
the
paragraph
beginning
articles
manufactured
or
produced
in
the
federal
republic
of
germany.
now,
on
appeal
by
the
government
it
was
also
held
that
the
regulation
was
too
vague
and
indefinite
to
sustain
a
criminal
prosecution
also.
on
appeal
by
the
government
to
the
second
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
district
court's
opinion
construing
the
regulation
was
tantamount
to
a
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
information
was
founded
and
that
the
order
of
dismissal
was
that
appealable
directly
to
this
court
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
it
said,
when
congress
used
the
term
statute
in
section
3731,
that
is
the
criminal
appeals
act,
it
did
so
in
the
broad
sense
and
meant
to
include
all
that
could
have
the
force
of
law
from
the
exercise
of
the
powers
which
congress
may
have
granted
as
part
of
--
part
of
the
statutory
scheme.
the
court
of
appeals
was
also
of
the
opinion
that
the
dismissal
of
the
information
amounted
to
an
order
sustaining
a
motion
in
bar
since
the
fact
of
the
order
end
the
cause
and
exculpate
the
defendant.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
we
think
the
court
–
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
proper
forum
for
this
appeal.
we
believe
the
word
statute
as
used
in
the
criminal
appeals
act
means
act
of
congress
and
not
administrative
regulation.
although
of
course,
as
the
basic
premise
administrative
regulation
have
the
force
of
law,
but
the
none
--
it
nonetheless
remains
true
that
as
to
any
specific
statutory
act
done
by
congress,
it's
necessary
to
look
at
the
context
in
which
the
words
have
been
used
to
determine
whether
the
statute
as
used
in
that
particular
piece
of
legislation
also
includes
administrative
regulations.
we
think
that,
since
so
far
as
the
criminal
appeals
act
is
concerned,
the
word
statute
should
be
read
narrowly
so
as
not
to
apply
to
administrative
regulation.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
this.
first
of
all,
administrative
regulation,
although
they
have
the
force
of
law
are
subordinate
to
the
laws
themselves
that
is
the
law
passed
by
congress
and
this
status
of
subordination
has
been
consistently
maintained.
for
example,
only
congress
may
impose
a
criminal
penalty
for
violation
of
a
regulation.
only
congress
may
declare
the
policy
as
to
what
type
of
conduct
may
be
punished
or
established
under
what
circumstances
a
particular
act
shall
be
criminal
or
established
criteria
to
aid
or
to
govern
the
issue
into
administrative
regulation.
and
continued
prosecution
depends
upon
the
continued
life
of
a
basic
statute,
that
is
absent
from
savings
clause
whereas
revocation
of
a
regulation
does
not
have
this
effect,
that
is
the
affect
of
terminating
prosecution.
so,
that
in
the
end,
the
regulation,
no
matter
how
sweeping
they
maybe,
must
find
their
justification
within
the
basic
statue
which
authorizes
their
issuance.
with
these
considerations
in
mind
then
that
the
regulation
is
subordinate
to
the
act
of
congress
and
that
there
may
well
be
a
real
difference,
a
look
at
18
u.s.c.
3731
that
is
the
criminal
appeals
act.
the
provision
in
the
criminal
appeals
act
for
direct
review
here
on
--
at
the
request
of
the
government
has
always
been
narrowly
construed
by
this
court.
it's
always
been
construed,
so
to
deny
supreme
court
jurisdiction
when
it
is
reasonably
possible
to
do
so.
and
there's
a
--
there's
a
reason
for
this,
it
has
been
said
that
in
one
aspect
at
least,
the
history
of
this
court
is
the
progressive
contraction
of
mandatory
review.
obviously,
congress
has
a
--
had
to
keep
the
work
within
capability
of
the
nine
judges
sitting
here
and
so,
we've
always
seen
a
gradual
withdrawal
of
provisions
for
automatic
review.
now,
the
criminal
appeals
act
runs
counter
to
this
trend
of
the
year
and
perhaps
because
of
this
and
perhaps
because
of
other
reasons
such
as
the
reason
that
an
appeal
by
the
government
is
not
usually
favored.
this
court
has
always
narrowly
construed
the
criminal
appeals
act.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
no,
your
honor.
in
foster,
there
was
a
construction
of
both
administrative
regulation
and
statute.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
misquote
myself.
it
was
the
construction
of
the
statute.
there,
the
post
master's
salary
depended
upon
the
gross
receipts
of
his
office
and
the
regulation
said
he
was
not
to
include
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
no
your
honor,
no
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
no,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
so.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
the
court
of
appeals
thought
so
and
thought
that
the
foster
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
discussed
in
our
brief
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
at
page
233
u.s.
515.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
generally,
that's
true.
but
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
yes.
of
course
the
question
had
--
this
precise
question
has
never
before
come
to
this
court.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
it
is
--
it
is
true.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
it
is
true
that
it's
been
restricted
strictly
to
the
case
where
the
district
court
has
gone
to
the
question
of
the
validity
or
construction
of
the
statute
and
that
alone
put
on
what
--
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
has
narrowed
its
review
has
been
upon
this
provision
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
no,
sir.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
no,
sir.
it
is
never
been
undecided.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
yes
your
honor,
but,
that's
put
upon
on
this
basis
that
the
statue,
the
criminal
appeal
statute
says
that
the
government
is
entitle
to
appeal
only
from
a
decision
where
such
decision
or
judgment
is
based
upon
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
or
information
is
founded.
now,
there
has
--
there
have
been
--
there
is
at
least
one
case
which
strikes
my
mind
where
the
district
court
judge
did
not
put
his
--
did
in
fact
construe
a
statute
but
he
did
not
construe
the
statute
upon
which
the
information
was
founded
and
in
that
instance,
this
court
returned
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
permit
him
to
consider
the
statute
upon
which
the
information
or
indictment
actually
was
founded.
now,
there,
the
decision
was
not
upon
a
question
of
pleading.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
oh,
yes.
when
the
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
or
when
views
were
intertwined
or
when
he
was
so
vague
that
you
couldn't
be
sure.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
sir,
the
fact
that
you
require
--
that
you're
called
upon
to
review
under
one
statute
is
not
necessarily
an
argument
to
review
under
the
other.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
sir,
i
--
i
once
again
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
and
--
and
it's
not
been
that
--
of
course
i
must
begin
with
the
proposition
that
hasn't
been
decided.
but
granting
that,
then
i
can
only
go
upon
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
and
it's
true
that
they've
involved
issues
where
there
has
been
--
this
court
has
declined
jurisdiction
where
there
has
been
a
mixture
of
view
which
expressed
by
the
district
court
and
where
the
sole
basis
for
this
decision
was
not
the
construction
or
invalidity
of
a
statute
itself.
but
nonetheless,
i
have
to
rely
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
oh,
dear.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
primo.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
and
provide
--
and
provide
some
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
and
provide
some
penalty
for
the
--
violation
of
the
regulation.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
precisely
at
all.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that's
precisely
looked
so.
when
this
simply
illustrate
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that
concludes
neither
all
is
that
this
is
a
distinction
between
a
regulation
and
a
statute.
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
regulation
cannot
do.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
nonetheless,
it
is
the
statute
alone
which
establishes
the
penalty
for
violation
of
the
regulation.
similarly
with
respect
to
case
such
as
hark,
there
the
allegation
was
the
violation
of
an
opa
regulation.
now,
that
regulation
was
revoked
after
the
act
and
before
the
indictment,
but
the
basic
statute
has
not
been
changed
and
so,
the
prosecution
continued
to
live
on
and
the
district
court
conclusion
dismissing
it
was
reversed
here
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
first,
--
first
of
all
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
well,
i've
--
i've
searched
very
carefully
through
the
legislative
history
of
the
1907
act
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
reference
to
administrate
a
regulation.
so
far
as
i
can
see,
the
primary
holding,
the
court
holding
which
brought
on
a
criminal
appeals
act
was
the
so
called
beef-trust
case
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
--
the
armour
case
where
a
district
court
have
sustained
a
special
plea
in
bar
and
the
criminal
appeals
act
of
course
made
that
a
separate
basis
for
direct
appeal
here.
and
in
case
that
special
plea
in
bar,
there
is
no
necessity
to
show
that
the
district
court
had
construed
a
statute.
but,
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
tell
from
the
legislative
history
itself,
this
question
of
--
question
of
administrative
regulation
simply
was
not
considered
at
least
not
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
nor
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
nor
in
the
reports
of
judiciary
committee
of
the
senate,
nor
in
--
nor
in
the
president's
message
recommending
a
criminal
appeals
act
or
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
second,
it
all
--
it
also
should
be
said
too
in
that
respect
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
has
been
considered
by
this
court
many,
many
times
since
1907.
and
--
well,
i
cannot
point
to
a
specific
case
where
there
was
something
other
than
an
issue
of
pleading
involved.
i
conclude
that
the
word
"statute"
should
be
read
not
to
include
in
--
an
administrative
regulation
because
of
the
tone
of
the
cases
more
than
of
anything
else.
the
tone
of
the
cases
has
been
to
read
very
strictly
that
they
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
i
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
on
the
merits
sir.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
i
would
like
to
say
i
couldn't
deal
about
special
plea
in
bar.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
to
say
just
as
--
to
talk
just
briefly
about
a
special
plea
in
bar.
the
word
motion
in
bar
used
in
the
present
statute,
i
think
has
the
same
content
as
the
word
special
plea
in
bar
as
originally
used
in
a
criminal
appeals
act
in
1907.
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
there
has
been
no
change
in
content.
the
change
in
phraseology
is
simply
meant
that
the
content
of
special
plea
in
bar
have
used
by
congress
has
simply
been
poured
in
the
phraseology
motion
in
bar.
now,
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
a
special
plea
in
bar
has
always
been
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
it,
number
one,
bars
the
action
completely.
number
two,
relies
upon
material
extrinsics
to
the
offense
itself
and
number
three
has
been
raised
specially
by
the
defendant.
instances
held
by
this
court
or
and
by
other
courts
to
be
special
plea
in
bar
includes
such
issues
as
res
judicata
--
res
judicata,
statute
of
limitations
as
a
matter
of
law,
well,
it
depends
upon
statutory
construction.
pardon
--
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
original
criminal
appeals
act
said
special
plea
in
bar.
that
language
continued
up
until
1948
when
it
was
changed
to
motion
in
bar
and
it
was
changed
merely
conform
to
rule
12
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
rule
54
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
shows
that
to
be
so
that
the
--
that
--
and
united
states
versus
hark
showed
that
to
be
so
too
for
that
matter.
although
hark
says
a
motion
in
bar
as
anything
that
ends
the
cause
and
exculpates
the
defendant
that
was
true
within
the
--
within
the
meaning
of
hark
within
that
situation,
but
a
special
plea
in
bar
when
you
state
generally
what
it
is,
you
must
also
go
on
a
say
that
it
depends
upon
extrinsic
fact
as
well
as
upon
the
--
the
fact
that
it
ends
the
cause
and
exculpate
the
defendant.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
no.
well,
originally,
the
law
--
a
new
plea
is
an
abatement
plea,
special
pleas
in
bar
and
pleas
in
bar
and
demurrer.
example
of
pleas
in
the
abatement,
they
were
distinguished
from
pleas
in
bar
in
that
they
--
the
plea
in
abatement
only
defeated
that
particular
indictment.
it
did
not
defeat
the
cause
of
action
itself.
examples
are
venue,
when
the
venue
provision
is
not
in
its
basic
statute,
miss
joinder
and
defect
on
the
grand
jury
proceedings,
things
of
that
sort,
if
i
may
say
just
very
quickly
with
respect
to
the
merit
here.
as
i
said,
the
district
court
rather
restriction
of
--
of
the
second
paragraph
of
the
treasury
decision
into
the
third
paragraph
of
the
treasury
decision,
this
we
think
was
wrong
from
many
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
title
of
the
regulation
says
that
--
it
applies
to
tariff
status
marking
to
indicate
the
name
of
the
country
of
origin
and
customs
evaluation
products
of
germany,
poland
and
(inaudible).
to
go
back
to
the
background
here,
in
1946
the
treasury
department
had
said,
“well,
you
can
mark
products
emanating
from
all
four
zones
as
made
in
germany.”
in
1949
however,
the
western
zones
refused
and
we've
permitted
that
federal
republic
of
germany
to
come
into
existence.
and
from
that
moment
on
at
least,
the
russian
zone
of
germany
stood
on
a
different
footing
from
the
other
zone.
in
1951,
congress
and
the
president
acted
in
this
customs
field
to
show
that
the
soviet
zone
stood
on
a
separate
footing.
it
withdrew
the
most
favored
nation
treatment
from
the
products
from
the
soviet
zone.
in
19
--
with
it
--
in
1953
then
against
that
background
that
this
treasury
decision
was
issued.
and
as
i
--
as
i've
said,
the
title
says
that
it
dealt
with
three
subjects
and
the
regulation
itself
shows
that
it
deals
with
three
subject.
first
of
all,
the
first
paragraph
deals
with
tariff
status
and
withdraws
most
favorite
nation
treatment
from
the
product
of
east
germany
that
continued
it
from
products
from
west
germany.
the
second
paragraph
deals
with
value
provision
and
it
gives
the
definition
of
country
there,
it
says
that
the
federal
republic
of
germany
shall
be
treated
as
one
country
on
the
eastern
zone
as
another
country
and
country
is
not
country
of
origin,
country
appears
in
section
402,
country
of
origin
appears
in
1304.
mr.
eugene
l.
grimm
my
conclusion
from
that
your
honor
is
that
paragraph
two
and
three
deal
with
different
things,
value
and
marking
to
inform
the
public.
they
are
phrased
in
different
language,
country
and
country
of
origin.
they
serve
different
purposes,
number
one,
collecting
the
proper
amount
of
duty
and
number
two,
informing
the
public
(inaudible).
for
these
reasons
because
they
have
a
separate
purposes
and
so
forth
serve
different
functions,
the
restriction
of
the
second
paragraph
should
not
be
read
into
the
third
paragraph.
the
title
says
that
they
are
separate
--
they
should
be
treated
as
separate.
it's
only
when
you
read
that
restriction
of
the
second
paragraph
from
the
third
paragraph
that
the
regulation
becomes
confusing
because
if
you
need
--
if
you
apply
the
third
paragraph
only
to
customs
valuation,
that
defines
a
phrase
a
country
of
origin
which
isn't
is
the
value
provisions
of
the
tariff
statute
and
for
this
reason,
we
think
it's
--
it's
incorrect
to
read
that
restriction
into
third
paragraph.
my
time
is
--
