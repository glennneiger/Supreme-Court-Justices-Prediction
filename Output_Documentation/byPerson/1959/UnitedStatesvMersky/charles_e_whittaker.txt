justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
possibly
that
there
has
been
a
little
time
when
(inaudible)
in
bar.
it's
not
in
relation
with
bar.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
not
the
motion
considered
in
a
patent
or
in
bar,
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
problem
may
i
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
any
contest
between
you
and
the
government
over
the
statute
proper
or
are
you
merely
disputing
the
proper
interpretation
of
treasury
regulation
5321?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
just
the
latter?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
then
--
so
then,
no
statute
has
been
held
unconstitutional?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
only
been
held
that
the
regulation
purporting
to
have
been
issued
under
the
statute
was
void,
under
your
view?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
go
ahead,
pardon
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then
doesn't
that
present
a
question
of
the
validity
of
regulation
whether
it
is
in
the
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
mean
then
that
under
criminal
appeals
act,
a
regulation
purporting
to
have
been
adopted
under
the
statute,
even
though
voids
the
mark
and
unauthorized
presents
a
matter
directly
appealable
to
this
court
and
not
to
court
of
appeals?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
understand
what
i
mean?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
it
your
position
that
a
regulation
which
is
broader
than
and
not
authorized
by
the
statute
which
purports
to
impose
some
duty
and
results
in
the
controversy
that
that
fact
alone
makes
that
matter
appealable
directly
to
this
court
under
the
criminal
appeals
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
for
that
--
not
for
that
reasons,
but
that
you
couldn't
tell
whether
it
was
a
(inaudible)
statute
without
construing
the
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
what
have
you
--
excuse
me
please.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
have
to
say
sir
about
the
--
the
fact
that
matters
--
judgements
undergone
motions
in
bar
are
appealable
directly
here?
