mr.
robert
l.
pierce
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
--
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
regard
appellant's
contentions,
they
are
the
--
here,
with
respect
to
the
restrictions
the
commission
has
granted
completely
unrestricted
authority
so
far
as
the
usual
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
are
concerned.
this
appellant
say
the
commission
could
not
have
done
under
the
language
of
section
5
(2)
(b),
the
national
transportation
policy
and
this
court's
decision
in
the
ata
case
unless
it
made
the
precise
specific
findings
as
to
the
existence
of
the
same
special
circumstances
as
existed
in
that
case.
now,
we
think,
it
is
plain
from
the
face
of
the
commission's
decision
that
appellants
major
premise
that
the
commission
here
granted
completely
unrestricted
authority
is
patently
incorrect
as
the
district
court
found
and
that
we
think
it's
also
clear
that
the
commission
definitely
paid
attention
to
the
national
transportation
policy
under
section
5
(2)
(b)
and
to
the
ata
decision.
i
think
this
is
clear
from
a
--
an
examination
of
the
commission's
report.
let's
turn
to
what
the
commission
decided
on
this
phase
of
the
case
and
as
discussion
of
this
question
at
first
correctly
described
this
court's
ata
decision
as
holding
that
though
the
policy
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
and
the
national
transportation
policy
must
be
considered
as
guiding
lights
in
granting
common
carrier
certificates
to
railroad
subsidiaries
nevertheless,
they
are
not
rigid
limitations
and
they
do
not
prevent
occasional
departures
from
that
rule
when
special
circumstances
in
the
public
interest
exist.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
undoubtedly
the
same
principles
of
the
ata
case
were
to
be
applied
when
we
had
a
contract
carrier
situation.
and
it
went
on
to
say
that
it
had
here
given
due
consideration
to
the
national
transportation
policy
under
section
5
(2)
(b).
it
next,
carefully
listed
the
five
restrictions
which
are
specifically
described
as
those
and
i
quote,
“usually
imposed
in
common
carrier
certificates
issued
to
rail
affiliates
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
service
rendered
there
under
shall
be
no
more
than
that
which
is
auxiliary
to
or
supplemental
of
train
service.
among
those
listed
as
number
two
was
the
requirement
that
applicant
shall
not
serve
any
point,
not
a
station
on
the
railroad.
the
commission
then
stated
that
it
believed
congress
except
an
unusual
circumstances,
did
not
intend
to
permit
railroad
subsidiaries
to
provide
contract
carrier
service
in
competition
with
other
railroads
and
independently
operated
motor
carriers
without
safeguards
to
ensure
that
the
service
should
not
be
broader
in
scope
in
its
real
operations.
accordingly
it
concluded
that
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
of
unusual
conditions,
the
present
permit
would
be
restricted
to
points
on
the
lines
of
southern
pacific.”
in
other
words,
the
commission
adopted
and
applied
the
territorial
restriction
which
he'd
--
had
set
forth
as
listed
as
being
one
of
the
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions.
we
think
it
is
evident
from
the
opinion
that
when
the
commission
said,
there
was
an
absence
of
unusual
conditions,
it
was
referring
only
to
the
precise
specific
special
circumstances
of
the
ata
case
namely,
adequacy
of
independent
motor
carrier
service.
and
we
think
it
is
also
evident
that
the
very
reason
that
the
commission
imposed
this
territorial
restriction,
this
auxiliary
and
supplemental
territory
restriction,
well,
it's
because
it
felt
obligated
to
do
so
by
the
ata
decision.
now,
the
only
situation
in
which
the
commission
did
not
impose
this
territorial
restriction
was
in
its
permitting
of
service
to
three
small
off
rail
points
austin,
tonopah
and
yerington,
nevada,
which
were
points
not
on
southern
pacific's
rail
lines.
there,
however,
it
appeared
that
the
precise
special
circumstances
of
the
ata
decision
were
present
since
those
points
were
served
neither
by
any
railroad,
nor
by
any
of
the
appellant-protesting
motor
carriers.
they
were
not
on
the
line
for
southern
pacific
either.
and
the
commission,
so
far
as
the
restrictions
were
concerned,
also
attached
a
restriction
reserving
the
right
to
impose
in
the
future
any
restrictions
which
may
appear
then
necessary
or
desirable
in
the
public
interest.
now,
we
submit,
that
the
restriction
of
the
rail
points
is
a
basic
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restriction.
and
i
think
my
answer
would
be
somewhat
different
from
what
mr.
ginnane
has
said
on
that.
we
say
that
this
is
true
whether
it's
viewed
historically
or
in
light
of
his
--
of
the
policy
behind
these
restrictions.
this
restriction
to
territorial
points
on
the
rail
lines
was
in
fact
that
one
percent
adopted
by
the
commission
in
the
very
first
volume
of
the
motor
carrier
reports
in
the
barker
as
the
basic
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restriction
to
carry
out
the
special
limitations
on
rail
acquisitions
of
motor
carriers
which
were
contained
on
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935,
and
about
40
cases
from
that
time
up
until
the
kansas
city
southern
case
in
1938,
it
was
constantly
--
consistently
attached
as
the
only
one.
in
the
kansas
city
southern
case
and
cases
dissents,
others
of
the
five
restrictions
which
were
listed
here
have
been
adding
--
have
been
added
including
more
functional
ones
such
as
that
service
must
be
performed
on
rail
rates
and
on
rail
billings
through
rail
billings
with
a
prior
subsequent
rail
halt,
but
the
commission
ever
since
despite
that,
has
consistently
continued
to
attach
this
territorial
restriction
as
one
of
the
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions.
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
well
i
don't
--
i
mean
not
just
a
--
a
--
it
may
not
be
auxiliary
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
i
think
it
is.
it's
the
same
points
that
we
can
serve
either
by
rail
or
by
truck.
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
well,
i
would
say
that's
what
we
mean
by
auxiliary
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
that's
correct.
from
that
--
in
that
sense,
it
is
true.
it
is
not
directly
connected
to
help
out
the
rail
operations,
but
nevertheless
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
i
think,
in
a
sense,
it
is
advantage
in
our
operation.
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
i
will
be
happy
to.
this
enables
us
to
provide
service
to
the
same
points
either
by
rail
or
by
truck.
now
at
one
--
if
one,
motor
transportation
was
strike
down
to
some
difficulty,
you
could
always
go
to
the
other.
so
it
does
enable
the
same
company
in
effect
to
provide
the
same
type
of
service
either
by
rail
or
by
motor
truck,
and
in
the
sense,
the
motor
truck
service
is
an
adjunct
of
the
rail
service.
now,
we
said
that
in
at
least
four
cases,
this
court
has
approved
the
commission's
practice
of
treating
this
territorial
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
the
word
territorial
would
be
actually
in
no
connection
with
the
railroad.
we
think
the
present
case
has
to
be
distinguished
from
what
this
court
properly
described
as
completely
unrestricted
operations
in
the
ata
case.
there,
the
commission
in
the
prior
rock
island
case
had
first
attached
all
five
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
including
the
territorial
one.
and
in
the
second
rock
island
or
ata
case,
it
has
eliminated
all
five
of
them.
furthermore,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
congress
must
be
deemed
to
have
approved
the
commission's
practice
of
considering
this
an
auxiliary
or
supplemental
restriction
since
it
reenacted
the
restricted
policy
originally
contained
in
the
motor
carrier
act
as
section
5
(2)
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
the
transportation
act
of
1940.
and
clearly
too,
this
restriction
was
auxiliary
and
supplemental
within
this
period
of
such
restrictions.
you
know,
the
purpose
behind
these
restrictions,
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
as
this
court
has
recognized,
is
to
prevent
rail
monopolization
of
independent
motor
trucking.
here,
the
commission's
decision
clearly
shows
that
it
imposed
this
restriction
solely
to
carry
out
this
purpose
and
for
the
competitive
protection
of
the
independent
motor
truckers
as
well
as
the
protesting
rail
lines.
it
was
obviously
a
restriction
which
did
not
reflect
the
need
of
the
shipper
and
which
probably,
as
mr.
ginnane
has
told,
you
would
not
have
been
attached,
if
anyone
other
than
a
rail
subsidiary
has
been
the
applicant.
thus,
the
record
establishes
that
general
motors
had
just
as
much
need,
in
fact,
if
not
more
to
off
rail
points
as
they
did
to
the
rail
points.
in
fact,
also
this
was
a
very
stringent
restriction
indeed
considering
that
the
application
of
pmt
has
sought
authority
to
serve
three
states
which
weren't
even
on
the
line
of
southern
pacific
and
considering
that
in
the
other
states
the
applications
had
requested
authority
which
was
statewide
whereas
the
commission
restricted
it
to
the
points
on
the
southern
pacific
rail
lines.
now,
we
think
that
the
commission's
refusal
to
impose
the
other
usual
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
applied
in
common
carrier
cases
was
not
based
on
any
departure
from
the
policy
of
the
ata
case
instead
as
the
decision
clearly
shows,
it
was
plainly
based
on
the
simple
fact
and
the
very
different
reason
that
such
restrictions
would
convert
these
operations
of
pmt
into
common
carrier
operations
and
would
therefore
have
been
beyond
the
power
of
the
commission
to
impose
under
section
209
(b).
both
before
and
after
section
209
(b)
was
reenacted
by
this
public
law
adopted
in
august
22,
1957,
this
section
had
only
authorized
the
commission
to
impose
in
a
permit,
reasonable
terms,
conditions
and
limitations
consistent
with
the
character
of
the
holder
as
a
contract
carrier.
this
is
a
good
time
to
stop
[laughs].
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
your
honors
please.
before
recess,
i
was
pointing
out
that
in
our
opinion,
the
basic
reason
why
the
commission
could
not
attach
this
other
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restriction
because
this
could
have
converted
the
carrier
into
a
common
carrier
and
that's
where
beyond
its
power
under
section
209
(b)
to
impose.
now,
the
reason
why
the
imposition
of
these
usual
restrictions
attached
in
motor
common
carrier
cases
must
necessarily
have
converted
these
operations
of
pmt
into
common
carrier
operations.
it
is
apparent
from
the
commission's
decision
of
the
--
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
cited
in
its
opinion.
there,
the
commission
observed
that
coordinated
rail
motor
service,
which
results,
when
it's,
in
that
case,
the
usual
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
are
attached
could
only
be
accomplished
through
a
medium
--
through
routes
and
joint
rates
between
a
railroad
and
a
motor
carrier.
in
the
present
case,
also,
the
commission
described
the
other
usual
restrictions
as
requiring
a
through
bill
of
lading
under
rail
rates
covering
also
a
prior
subsequent
rail
haul.
under
section
216
(c)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
only
through
routes
and
joint
rates
between
railroads
and
motor
common
carriers
are
permitted
there,
not
permitted
with
contract
carriers.
so
that
appellants'
argument,
we
submit,
thus
leads
to
the
observed
result
that
they
would
have
the
commission-attached
restrictions
commanding
southern
pacific
and
pmt
to
do
that,
which
they
cannot
lawfully
do
under
the
above
section
unless
pmt
is
considered
to
be
a
common
carrier
under
these
operations.
neither
in
brief
nor
in
oral
argument
have
the
appellants
or
the
government
successfully
establish
that
the
commission,
as
a
matter
of
law,
had
any
authority
to
attach
these
other
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
in
a
contract
carrier
situation,
which,
we
submit,
is
the
real
weakness
to
their
case.
now,
the
appellants
try
to
meet
this
issue
by
saying
that
the
commission
should
--
could
have
granted
--
should
have
granted
a
common
carrier
certificate
instead
of
a
contract
carrier
permit
with
the
usual
restrictions
attached.
but
under
its
past
practice
and
under
the
law,
the
commission
could
only
have
done
this
if
it
found
that
this
particular
operations
were,
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
a
matter
of
law,
common
carrier
operations.
and
here,
instead
it
found
that
that
was
not
the
case.
it
found
that
they
were
common
contract
carrier
operations
within
the
classical
definition
of
that
because
they
were
restricted
to
a
single
shipper.
and
in
fact,
the
permit
specifically
limits
the
service
to
--
to
be
performed
for
general
motors.
the
government
attempts
to
meet
this
issue
by
arguing
that
if
the
commission
had
no
power
to
attach
this
other
condition
in
a
contract
carrier
case,
then
in
the
absence
of
the
precise
special
circumstances
of
the
ata
case,
it
had
no
power
to
grant
any
permit.
we
think
there
are
several
persuasive
answers
to
this
argument.
first,
the
ata
case
itself
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
--
clear
authority
that
the
limitation
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
what's
that,
sir?
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
--
i
think
you
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
--
have
to
decide
the
commission
had
no
power
to
grant
a
--
any
--
impose
any
restrictions,
which
would
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
no.
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
it
could
not.
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
that's
right.
secondly,
we
think
that
any
requirement
that
the
commission
must
attach
any
particular
restrictions
which
may
heard
perhaps
in
the
broad
language
of
the
national
transportation
policy
must
yield
to
the
more
specific
language
of
section
209
(b)
which
requires
the
commission
shall
not
attach
restrictions
inconsistent
with
contract
carrier
status.
and
thirdly,
the
language
of
section
209
(b)
is
much
less
broad
in
the
comparable
language
of
section
208
(a)
in
which
allows
the
commission
in
common
carrier
cases
to
attach
such
reasonable
limitations
as
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
may
in
time
require.
fourthly,
when
congress,
in
1957,
amended
section
209
(b)
and
spelled
out
in
detail
the
various
criteria
which
the
commission
was
to
consider
under
the
public
interest
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
it
did
not
list
any
special
rules
to
be
applied
when
railroads
subsidiaries
were
applicants,
and
it
left
in
the
limitation
that
any
restrictions
to
be
attached
must
be
consistent
with
contract
carrier
status.
we
think
it
is
significant
that
at
the
time
or
prior
the
time
when
this
amendment
was
made,
the
commission
had
decided
at
least
six
cases
involving
issuance
of
contract
carrier
permits
to
rail
subsidiaries,
one
involving
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
for
involving
pmt
and
including
the
first
decision
in
the
present
case,
and
none
of
which
were
the
present
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
attached.
it
is
also
significant
that
in
1957,
when
the
motor
carrier
industry
had
become
a
strong
competitor
of
the
railroads,
there
was
much
less
chance
of
the
railroads
monopolizing
independent
motor
carrier
transportation.
and
there
was
in
1935
and
1940,
when
these
policy
limitations
were
first
adopted.
in
fact,
the
recent
book
by
mr.
james
c.
nelson,
entitled
“railroad
transportation
and
public
policy”,
which
was
produced
by
the
brookings
institute,
shows
that
in
1940,
the
railroads
had
67.4%
of
the
total
rail
motor
transportation,
whereas
in
1935,
their
share
of
those
revenues
had
dropped
to
or
in
--
to
38.7%
in
1955.
now,
we
say
also
that
there's
another
reason
why
the
commission
was
justified
in
not
attaching
the
usual
restrictions
even
in
the
absence
of
the
precise
special
circumstances
of
the
ata
case,
namely,
the
adequacy
of
other
private
carrier
service.
both
that
decision
and
the
commission's
decisions
in
the
rock
island
cases
indicate
that
special
circumstances
are
not
to
be
confined
any
particular
set
of
facts,
but
rather
mean
that
such
unusual
conditions
show
that
forgoing
of
the
usual
restrictions
will
be
consisted
with
the
public
interest
because
not
amounting
to
any
undue
restraint
of
independent
motor
carrier
competition.
only
two
weeks
ago
or
only
about
a
week
ago,
the
commission
decided
a
case
which
your
honors
might
like
to
note,
(inaudible)
truck
lines
purchased
george
r.
pirnie,
p-i-r-n-i-e,
and
james
pirnie,
that's
mcf
6345.
this
case
indicates
in
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
pierce
6345.
this
case
indicates
that
even
in
a
purchase
case,
the
commission
does
not
regard
special
circumstances
as
confined
to
any
particular
set
of
facts
but
rather
considers
the
primary
criterion
as
to
whether
the
grant
of
the
authority
or
the
purchase
is
going
to
result
in
undue
harm
and
competitive
restraint
of
independent
motor
carriers.
now,
if
that
is
the
test
of
what
you're
talking
about
when
you
say
special
circumstances,
certainly
the
commission
made
the
--
make
findings
here
along
that
line.
it
found
first
that
since
--
so
far
as
traffic
the
rail
point
is
concern
and
since
this
traffic
had
all
been
moving
by
rail
before
that,
the
grant
of
this
authority
would
not
have
any
competitive
cause,
any
competitive
injury
to
the
independent
truck
lines.
it
also
found
that
if
the
permit
was
denied,
general
motors
would
not
use
the
appellant
service
but
would
institute
proprietary
operations
of
its
own
or
else
call
upon
another
contract
carrier.
now,
the
record
clearly
shows
that
this
was
a
very
reasonable
decision
of
general
motors.
it
shows
that
pmt
had
faithfully
served
general
motors
and
dedicated
its
service
to
it
as
an
intrastate
carrier
ever
since
1933
in
california
and
as
an
interstate
carrier
ever
since
1945.
it
further
shows
that
pmt
was
the
only
carrier
which
had
its
loading
and
unloading
facilities
immediately
adjacent
to
the
general
motors'
plant.
it
shows
that
none
of
the
other
available
common
carriers
could
have
dedicated
their
service
to
general
motors
because
that
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
their
common
carrier
calling.
it
shows
also
that
general
motors'
competitors
have
the
advantages
of
this
same
type
of
service
in
the
form
of
two
of
the
contractors,
who
--
who
are
appellants
in
this
case,
namely,
it
shows
that
bmh,
a
contract
carrier,
served
ford
and
that
or
rather
hardly
served
ford
and
that
bmh
had
been
serving
studebaker.
so
we
submit
that
so
far
as
the
question
of
restriction
is
concern,
there
is
nothing
to
appellants'
case.
i'm
not
going
to
labor
the
argument
about
the
dual
operations,
particularly,
the
government
even
concedes
the
commission
was
right
on
that.
essentially,
the
commission
made
three
findings
there.
they
found
that
--
that
based
on
the
prior
record,
pmt
service
had
been
completely
--
without
any
charge
of
discrimination,
it
found
that
there
was
not
much
chance
of
any
discrimination
here
anyway
since
it
was
to
serve
by
the
single
shipper,
but
the
primary
thing
is
that
it
confined
--
required
pmt
as
an
incident
to
securing
this
contract
carrier
authority
to
give
up
all
of
its
rights
to
carry
the
same
commodities
as
a
common
carrier,
so
that
absolutely,
there
was
no
chance
of
any
violation
of
section
210
because
of
its
dual
operation
question.
one
other
question,
we
submit
too
that
the
commission
or
that
the
lower
court,
the
majority
of
the
lower
court
were
purely
correct
when
they
held
that
the
appellants
here,
either
the
individual
truck
lines
or
the
associations
had
no
standing
to
sue
because
they
were
--
were
not
parties
in
interest
and
they
were
not
damaged
by
the
administrative
action.
essentially,
this
is
a
jug
in
a
manger
action
by
the
american
trucking
association
and
some
of
its
members
to
keep
the
railroads
from
engaging
in
even
a
limited
form
of
--
of
carrier
--
motor
carrier
transportation.
the
--
the
complaint
is
completely
devoid
of
any
allegation
of
injury
to
the
appellants.
and
the
commission's
decision
shows
clearly
that
there
was
none.
thus,
from
the
decisions
of
the
commission,
it
appears
that
this
traffic
had
already
--
had
long
been
moving
by
rail
and
would
continue
to
move
by
rail.
and
it
shows
also
that
even
if
the
applications
were
denied,
general
motors
would
not
use
these
appellant
services
but
would
use
these
other
services
or
bring
in
its
own.
and
another
indication
that
there
was
no
real
injury
is
the
fact
that
after
appellants
had
--
had
made
a
motion
for
temporary
restraining
order,
which
was
denied,
they,
thereafter,
abandoned
their
claims
for
an
interlocutory
injunction.
and
we
submit
that
on
the
authority
of
the
santa
fe
case,
which
is
mentioned
in
our
brief
and
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
a
few
years
ago,
under
this
set
of
facts,
the
appellants
really
had
no
standing
to
maintain
its
action.
there,
the
shoe
was
on
the
other
foot.
in
that
case,
certain
railroads
attempted
to
set
aside
an
order
of
the
commission
which
had
permitted
the
merger
of
--
of
several
motor
carriers
under
a
stronger
financial
hat.
and
the
court
held
there
that
something
more
than
a
common
desire
for
the
enforcement
of
the
law
must
be
present
but
that
there
must
be
some
actual
injury,
and
it
--
it
distinguished
such
cases
as
the
alton
railroad
case
upon
which
the
appellants
rely
because
there,
it
said
that
there
was
a
right
of
the
carrier
to
try
to
stop
and
set
aside
a
commission
order
approving
a
grant
of
authority
to
--
of
new
operations
to
a
competing
form
of
transportation
where
it
threatened
the
traffic.
and
here,
as
i
try
to
make
it
clear,
there
is
no
competitive
threat
to
the
traffic
of
these
appellants
arising
from
this
order.
now,
this
authority
has
been
in
effect
ever
since
november
1958.
this
operation
has
been
conducted
under
--
for
that
considerable
length
of
time.
the
commission
has
definitely
found
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
it
has
tried
to
weigh
the
requirements
under
section
209
(b)
which
are
--
that
the
--
as
amended,
which
says
that
the
commission
shall
consider
primarily
the
effect
of
granting
the
application
upon
the
services
of
the
competing
forms
of
transportation.
that's
exactly
what
it
tried
to
do
here.
it
--
it
attempted
to
accommodate
the
shipping
--
shippers'
needs
without
causing
undue
harm
to
the
competing
forms
of
transportation.
so
i
submit
that
the
order
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
