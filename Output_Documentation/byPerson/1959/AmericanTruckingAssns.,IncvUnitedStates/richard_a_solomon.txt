mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
--
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
is
appearing
here
in
support
of
the
petitioners,
because
we
read
the
decision.
it
makes
a
serious
in-row
in
a
congressional
policy
of
great
importance
to
preclude
railroad
domination
of
the
trucking
business.
now,
prior
to
this
case
under
the
case
law
of
the
commission
and
of
this
court,
the
law
was
that
a
railroad
or
a
railroad
subsidiary
could
enter
the
trucking
business
only
in
one
or
two
circumstances.
it
could
do
so
if
its
rail
operations
were
to
be
used
to
public
advantage
in
connection
with
its
own
operations.
and
this
court
held
in
the
american
trucking
case.
it
can
also
do
so
occasionally
on
the
showing
of
special
circumstances
which
require
in
the
public
interest
that
a
rail
owned
motor
carrier
provide
service.
now,
in
this
case,
as
we
read
the
commission's
decision,
the
icc
has
said
in
a
contract
carrier
situation
despite
the
fact
that
in
this
case
we
find
no
special
circumstances.
despite
that
fact,
the
railroad
may
nevertheless
serve
in
an
extended
area
--
pardon
me,
to
the
railroad
subsidiary
may
nevertheless
serve
as
a
motor
carrier
in
an
extended
area
in
a
manner
which
isn't
conceivably
related
to
the
rail's
operations.
in
other
words,
if
this
decision
stands,
as
we
see
it,
in
a
contract
carrier
situation,
a
railroad
is
going
to
be
free
at
least
within
the
area
in
which
it
has
rail
lines
to
provide
motor
service
for
the
largest
shippers
of
this
country,
such
as
southern
pacific
is
here
providing
for
general
motors,
which
isn't
at
all
restricted
or
tied
to
the
railroads
operations.
and
whether
or
not,
we
believe
that
might
be
good
policy,
as
we
understand
it,
that
that
is
the
policy
which
congress
was
intending
to
preclude
in
the
national
transportation
policy
and
in
section
5
(2)
(b)
of
this
act,
which
this
court
has
properly
held
has
to
be
considered
in
this
application.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
on
this
record?
on
this
record
and
on
the
findings
of
the
commission
made,
the
limits
it
was
entitled
to
do
were
to
deny
the
application.
i
had
slightly
in
saying
upon
the
findings
the
commission
made,
i
must
perfectly
frank
in
saying
that
there
are
underlying
facts
in
this
record
which
are
discussed
at
great
length
by
both
of
the
--
of
the
appellees
here,
which
if
the
commission
have
thought
they
were
significant,
may
conceivably
have
been
significant
within
the
meeting
of
justice
clark's
decision
in
the
american
trucking
case.
but
as
i
will
try
and
point
out,
the
commission
found
exactly
the
opposite.
and
on
this
record
and
with
the
findings
that
the
commission
made
on
this
record,
its
alternative
was,
as
we
see
it,
to
deny.
i
presume
there's
another
alternative
to
restrict
but
as
a
practical
matter,
restriction
is
denial,
if
the
restriction
is
the
type
of
restriction
that
we
always
understood
the
court
and
the
commission
was
talking
about,
i.e.,
a
restriction
with
--
does
tie
rail
operations
to
motor
operations
to
the
railroad.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
think
there's
some
dispute
as
to
what
the
court
was
saying
there.
my
friends,
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
you're
quoting
the
court's
language
correctly,
your
honor,
and
i
can
only
say
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
here
doesn't
believe
that's
what
the
court
meant.
mr.
ginnane
will
argue
here
that
the
court
wasn't
saying
that
there
were
special
circumstances
and
he
agrees
that
there
was
no
finding
of
special
circumstances.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
--
it
can
be,
but
the
problem
that
you
were
raising
before
as
to
burden
here,
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
in
this
situation.
the
general
policy
of
congress
is
that
railroads
do
not
engage
in
the
trucking
business.
the
exceptional
policy
is
that
they
might,
upon
the
showing
special
circumstances.
under
those
situations,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
burden
was
on
the
railroad
here.
but
irrespective
of
where
the
burden
may
have
been,
the
commission
made
opposite
claims.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
would
prefer
to
say
that
the
court
was
in
error
rather
than
indulging
a
non-census.
my
friend,
mr.
ginnane
and
so
i
read
his
brief
that's
in
effect
says
that
they're
indulging
in
at
least
bad
english.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
i
understand
mr.
ginnane's
opinion
--
brief,
that's
what
he
says
about
this
language.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
position
before
this
court
is
a
perfectly
simple
one.
they
say
the
policy
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
in
the
national
transportation
act
is
applicable
in
contract
carrier
situations.
they
have
said
it.
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
it
and
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
they
say,
as
i
read
their
brief
at
least,
there
were
no
special
circumstances
in
this
case
of
the
type
that
was
involved
in
the
previous
ata
case.
but
they
say
in
recognition
of
that
fact,
the
commission
did
exercise
its
discretion
here
and
gave
pmt
less
authority
than
they
sought.
now,
there's
no
question
about
it
that
the
commission
did
give
pmt
less
authority
than
pmt
thought
--
wanted.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
one
commissioner
thought
they
ought
to
have
a
little
more,
but
mostly
that
fight
was
between
whether
they
should
have
as
much
they
got
or
any.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
they
did
not
and
that's
the
icc
argument
here.
they
say,
there
were
no
special
circumstances
and
the
policy
is
applicable
and
therefore,
instead
of
giving
pmt
the
authority
to
operate
for
general
motors
throughout
this
entire
area,
we
only
gave
them
part
of
the
authority
they
wanted.
now,
i'd
like,
in
a
minute,
if
i
have
time
to
go
over
the
decision,
because
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
commission,
in
fact,
said.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
several
states
that
they
wanted
to
serve
were
entirely
excluded.
certain
other
states
that
they
wanted
to
serve
were
included
only
to
the
extent
that
points
on
the
southern
pacific
rail
lines
were
involved.
i
think
it's
fair
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
rationale
is
set
forth,
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
on
page
27
of
the
commission's
decision.
this
is
a
very
long
commission
decision,
but
very
little
of
it
is
a
decision.
most
of
it
is
recital
of
facts.
what
the
commission
said
on
page
27
and
i
want
to
point
out
initially
that
they
weren't
discussing
on
page
27
the
5
(2)
(b)
problem
at
all.
they
were
just
merely
discussing
general
public
interest
considerations.
what
they
said
there
was
that
insofar
as
pmt
wants
to
serve
beyond
the
rail
lines
of
the
southern
pacific,
we
don't
think
they
should
because
that
service
at
the
present
moment
is
being
shared
by
rail
between
the
southern
pacific
and
other
railroads
and
in
one
case,
another
motor
carrier.
and
if
we
allow
pmt
to
serve
general
motors
beyond
the
southern
pacific
rail
line,
it
means
that
some
business
that
southern
pacific
now
has
as
a
rail
line
is
going
to
be
diverted
to
its
subsidiary
away
from
other
rail
lines.
and
in
making
this
determination
since
general
motors
had
argued
very
strongly
that
there
were
special
circumstances
that
required
in,
in
making
this
determination,
the
commission
--
and
this
is
in
the
middle
of
page
27,
says
--
talking
about
the
request
to
serve
beyond
the
rail
lines,
“such
eventuality
has
it
been
in
no
way
justified
and
the
public
interest
in
forestalling
it
as
a
parent.
and
then
they
say
shippers'
argument
that
motor
services
needed
to
meet
competition
of
other
automobile
producers
can
be
accorded
little
prohibitive
way
in
the
face
of
its
continued
refusal
to
make
use
of
the
available
services
of
the
protesting
motor
carriers.
and
they
go
on
in
the
next
sentence
to
throw
out
another
major
argument
that
general
motors
made
here.
now,
when
they
came
to
the
service
on
the
southern
pacific
line,
at
the
bottom
of
the
same
page,
they
reached
a
different
conclusion
and
they
reached
it
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
the
protesting
motor
carriers
aren't
going
to
gain
anything
because
after
all,
southern
pacific
has
this
traffic.
it's
merely
going
to
go
from
the
rail
line
to
the
motor
carrier
line.
well,
your
honors,
that
maybe
good
economics
in
the
year
1960,
but
it's
very
bad
law
under
the
transportation
act.
congress
has
not
provided
that
railroads
may
freely
follow
their
traffic
when
for
one
reason
or
another
the
shipper
wants
to
use
trucks
or
aviation
or
water
carriers.
that
is
not
a
reason.
i
shouldn't
think
it
would
be
a
reason
under
a
public
interest
standard,
but
it
certainly
is
not
a
reason
why
the
express
policy
of
this
congress
against
unrestricted
rail
operation
of
motor
transport
could
be
negated.
and
the
other
reason
they
give
is
the
reason
to
which
mr.
beardsley
referred
previously
and
that
is
they
say
we
might
as
well
grant
this
service
because
after
all
general
motors
has
said
that
they're
not
going
to
give
the
business
to
these
protestants.
they're
going
to
give
it
to
another
contract
carrier
in
texas
which
they
happen
to
like
better
or
if
the
commission
wouldn't
grant
that
carrier,
they'll
go
in
through
operations
for
themselves.
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
they
made
this
determination
and
the
basis
was
not
that
they
were
restricting
the
service
to
comply
with
5
(2)
(b)
because,
to
please
the
court,
when
you
look
on
the
very
next
pages,
on
page
28
through
31,
which
is
the
discussion,
the
only
discussion
that
this
commission
has
as
to
why
they
were
not
making
the
restrictions
and
not
denying
the
grant
because
of
--
despite
the
5
(2)
(b)
problem.
what
they
say
here
is
--
and
i'm
going
to
have
to
go
very
quickly
through
it
because
my
time
is
going
up.
what
they
say
there
is
first
of
all,
they
say,
"we
recognize
that
the
same
principles
are
applicable
here
in
contract
carrier
situations
as
were
applicable
in
common
carrier
situations.”
then
they
say,
“so
let
us
look
at
our
various
conditions
which
we
normally
apply
if
these
were
a
common
carrier
applicant.”
and
they
say
there
are
five
of
them.
and
they
list
them
at
the
bottom
of
page
29.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
think
not.
i
think
what
they're
merely
doing
there
is
referring
to
the
fact
that
207
and
209,
the
application
sections
do
not
contain
the
express
limitations
that
5
(2)
(b)
does.
and
--
and
it's
for
that
very
reason
that
this
court
has
held
that
in
exceptional
circumstances,
there
could
be
unrestricted
grants.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
correct.
and
that's
this
court's
holding
in
american
trucking
case
and
if
there
are
special
circumstances
here
of
a
type.
now
obviously,
this
court
in
the
american
trucking
case
wasn't
saying
merely
by
labeling
something
special
circumstances
you
get
around
from
the
policy.
obviously,
it
was
talking
at
least,
justice
black,
in
terms
of
special
circumstances
which
would
warrant
a
deviation
from
the
basic
policy
of
the
act
which
is
that
trucking
business
should
be
carried
on
by
truckers
and
not
by
railroads.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
in
this
discussion
of
whether
they
should
impose
restriction
or
not,
they
end
up
by
saying
the
restrictions
we
normally
impose
and
which
we
imposed
in
the
ata
case
--
i
mean
the
rock
island
case,
all
happened
to
be
applicable
to
contract
carriers.
those
restrictions
would
result
in
making
this
carrier
a
common
carrier
and
therefore,
we're
very
sorry
but
we
can't
make
these
restrictions
and
the
only
one
we
can
make
is
the
limiting
--
restrictions
limiting
it
to
a
--
the
rail
lines
of
the
southern
pacific.
a
restriction
which
is
i've
pointed
out
and
mr.
beardsley
pointed
doesn't
do
the
job.
they
don't
consider
whether
other
restrictions
might
be
available.
they
simply
say,
“well,
we'll
make
what
restrictions
we
can
irrespective
of
their
effectiveness.”
now,
the
trouble
with
that
is
that
it
begs
the
entire
questions
in
the
case.
the
question
in
this
case
was
not
how
much
this
grant
has
to
be
restricted.
the
question
in
this
case
was
whether
the
grant
should
be
made
or
not
and
the
difficulty
with
this
entire
position
of
the
commission
here
is
that
they
assumed
that
they
were
going
to
make
the
grant.
and
the
only
question
that
they're
discussing
in
this
entire
three
or
four-paged
discussion
in
this
matter
is
to
what
extent
it
is
going
to
be
restricted.
and
they
end
up
by
saying
they
are
restricting
it,
but
the
--
and
of
course
you
can
play
on
words
here
as
to
what's
a
restriction
and
what
is
not.
but
the
final
thought
i
do
want
to
leave
you
with
is,
whatever
you
call
it,
pacific
motor
transport
company
which
is
a
subsidiary
of
the
southern
pacific
is
authorized,
if
this
case
stands
to
carry
many,
many
trucks
for
general
motors
from
its
plants
in
california
to
a
number
of
bulk
points
in
a
number
of
states
and
there
isn't
any
connection
between
the
service
which
has
been
authorized
here
and
the
railroad,
the
southern
pacific
parent.
there
is
no
connection
whatsoever
except,
of
course,
that
the
stockholders
of
the
southern
pacific
will
reap
such
profits
as
might
be
involved.
now
that
type
of
restriction,
i
suggest,
is
no
restriction
as
far
as
the
policy
applied
to
(inaudible)
biggest
concern.
