mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
dismissed
our
complaint
to
set
aside
a
report
and
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
two
grounds.
first,
on
the
merits,
second,
the
court
said
--
or
two
of
the
three
judges
said
that
the
plaintiffs
had
no
standing
to
bring
this
suit
to
begin
with.
the
report
and
order,
which
is
involved
here,
authorizes
pacific
motor
trucking
company,
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
--
of
the
southern
pacific
railroad
to
perform
unrestricted
motor
carrier
service
from
three
california
general
motors
assembly
plants,
are
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
appendix
to
the
commission's
report
which
is
printed
at
page
39
of
the
record
here.
the
appellants
are
six
independent
motor
carriers,
four
common
--
four
common
carriers
and
two
contract
carriers
and
three
carrier
associations.
the
status
of
these
independent
carriers,
their
icc
authority
and
their
testimony
regarding
their
willingness
and
ability
to
serve
general
motors
is
set
forth
in
appendix
b
of
our
brief
on
the
merits
here.
we
believe
the
commission
aired
in
the
following
manner.
first
in
authorizing
the
rail
subsidiary
to
perform
service
not
restricted
the
so-called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
operations
in
view
of
its
specific
finding
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
showing
of
unusual
circumstances
here.
we
also
believed
that
the
commission's
report
and
order
here
violates
the
so-called
dual
authority
provisions
of
section
210
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
of
course
is
section
310
or
49
u.s.c.
annotated.
we
think
the
court
below
compounded
the
commission's
error,
so
to
speak,
in
holding
contrary
to
the
commission,
that
special
circumstances
justified
the
commission's
action
in
holding
that
the
plaintiffs
had
no
standing
to
bring
this
suit
and
in
attaching
any
significance
at
all
to
the
amendments
made
in
1957
to
section
209
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
dealing
with
applications
to
perform
contract
carrier
service.
and
both
of
the
commission's
reports
which
--
which
are
printed
in
the
record
here,
one
of
them
commencing
at
page
8
and
the
other
at
54,
there,
the
heading
of
sub
34.
although
you
will
note
from
the
authority
sought
in
these
various
applications
in
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
5,
that
the
sub
34
case
involved
relatively
minor
authority
compared
with
that
which
was
sought
in
the
sub
37
case.
this
proceeding
really
started
out
as
four
separate
applications
before
the
commission,
sub
34
through
37.
after
the
commission's
first
report
in
the
sub
34
case
and
while
the
other
three
cases
were
pending
before
it,
it
granted
petitions
for
reconsideration
of
its
sub
34
report
and
consolidated
all
the
four
cases
into
one
proceeding
and
it
is
with
respect
to
its
consolidated
report
which
is
dated
september
9,
1958
and
commencing
at
page
8
of
the
record
when
our
complaint
was
filed.
coming
immediately
to
what
we
think
is
the
most
important
error
committed
by
the
commission
here
is
our
belief
that
it
does
violence
to
this
court's
very
recent
decision
in
a
so-called,
ata
case,
american
trucking
associations
v.
united
states
and
icc,
which
is
reported
at
355
u.s.
141.
that
case
involved
an
application
filed
under
section
207
of
the
act
which
deals
with
applications
to
perform
common
carrier
service.
this
proceeding
involves
an
application
filed
under
section
209
dealing
(inaudible)
but
the
commission's
report
conceives
and
for
once,
we
agree
with
it.
they
then
so
far
as
grants
of
motor
rights
to
railroads
or
their
subsidiaries
are
concerned,
the
same
principle
applies
regardless
of
the
type
of
carrier
it
sought
to
be
performed.
if
i
may
very
briefly,
i
just
like
to
review
the
ata
case.
that
involved
an
application
by
a
subsidiary,
the
rock
island
railroad
to
the
commission,
seeking
unrestricted
authority
essentially
between
omaha
and
chicago.
now,
in
that
case,
the
independent
motor
carriers,
who
were
protestants
before
the
commission
and
appellants
here,
urged
that
the
proviso
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
of
the
act,
which
is
directly
applicable
in
purchase
cases,
and
which
in
effect,
requires
that
railroads
maybe
authorized
to
perform
only
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
auxiliary
and
supplemental
service.
they
urge
there
that
those
provisions
of
5
(2)
(b)
had
to
be
read
into
section
207
because
it
should
be
pretty
obvious
that
if
the
railroad
can
do
on
the
one
hand
what
it
can't
do
on
the
other,
the
restriction
in
the
first
instances
is
of
very
little
value.
the
commission
held,
however,
that
in
the
207
case,
where
we
were
asking
that
that
language
be
read
in
and
in
where
it
was
not
directly
applicable,
the
commission
said
that
where
exceptional
circumstances
prevailed
as
it
found
they
did
there,
it
was
entitled
to
issue
in
a
207
proceeding,
a
--
an
unrestricted
certificate.
now,
the
exceptional
circumstances
which
the
commission
found
in
that
case
were
that
the
independent
motor
carriers
who
were
protestants
before
the
commission,
had
failed
to
provide
adequate
service
to
the
small
aisle
or
points
involved
between
chicago
on
the
one
hand
and
omaha
on
the
other.
in
fact,
the
commission
went
even
further
and
made
what
amounted
to
a
finding
of
willful
failure.
it
said
they
had
provided
the
service
only
where
it
suited
their
convenience.
now,
that
commission
finding
respecting
what
i
call
the
willful
failure,
the
independent
carriers
in
that
case
to
provide
service
was
upheld
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
this
court
and
the
holding
was
that
(inaudible)
policy
underlying
section
5
(2)
(b),
ordinarily
has
to
be
applied
even
in
section
207
cases.
the
commission
can,
in
exceptional
circumstances,
grant
unrestricted
authority.
and
in
your
decision
in
the
ata
case,
you
referred
to
your
prior
decision
in
the
texas
and
pacific
case
and
the
rock
island
case,
back
in
1951,
and
you
said
this
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
your
decision
at
355
u.s.
151,
152,
“we
repeat,
as
we
said
in
those
cases,
that
the
underlying
policy
of
5
(2)
(b)
must
not
be
divorced
from
proceedings
for
new
certificates
under
section
207.
indeed
the
commission
must
take
cognizance
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
apply
the
act
as
a
whole,
but
for
reasons
we
have
stated,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
commission
acts
beyond
its
statutory
authority,
when
in
the
public
interest,
it
occasionally
departs
from
the
auxiliary
and
supplementary
limitations
in
a
section
207
proceeding.”
i
would
like
to
concur
as
the
factual
situation.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
we
think
they
did,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
it
referred
to
it
because
i
see
that
more
or
less
tipped
its
head
in
passing
by,
but
it
--
it
did
not
follow
what
i
think
on
the
clear
guidepost
laid
down
by
ata
case.
of
course
that's
the
nub
of
this
argument
here.
in
this
instance,
in
this
proceeding,
far
from
being
unwilling
to
provide
service
as
was
a
case
in
the
ata
case,
if
prostesting
motor
carriers
here
have
been
literally
banging
on
general
motors'
door
for
years
in
unclean
effort
to
get
some
of
their
trucking,
only
to
be
given
a
very
cold
shoulder,
they
had
been
able
to
attain
some
traffic
out
of
these
general
motors
plants
in
instances
in
which
the
automobiles
involved
had
been
bought
and
paid
for
by
the
government
and
in
which
the
government
pays
the
freight
and
control
of
the
traffic,
but
that
is
all.
you
might
say
to
paraphrase
a
--
well,
a
well-known
statement
that
this
is
one
instance
in
which
what's
good
for
the
government
isn't
good
for
general
motors.
but
again
and
i
think
it
of
utmost
importance
to
know
that
here,
in
a
very
striking
contrast
to
its
situation
in
the
ata
case,
there
were
no
in
advocacies
shown
at
all
in
the
service
of
the
independent
motor
carriers,
rather
their
failure
to
handle
any
of
these
general
motors
traffic
is
simply
as
commissioner
murphy
said
dissenting
here.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
say
the
commission
did
not
find.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no,
sir.
i'll
be
happy
to.
they
said
in
effect
that
the
general
motors
had
been
using
pmt
for
some
years,
for
intrastate
service
in
california
where
the
same
kind
of
policy
doesn't
apply,
they
spoke
of
the
possibility
of
confusion
at
general
motors
plants
if
--
if
some
other
carrier
were
used.
and
as
we
say
it,
the
--
they
simply
tailored
their
decision
to
suit
the
wishes
of
general
motors
in
this
case.
and
we
think
that
they
simply
tailored
their
decision
to
suit
the
wishes
of
general
motors
in
this
case
and
we
don't
believe
that
under
the
congressional
policy
which
is
involved,
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that
was
properly
done.
you
think
that's
a
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
we're
arguing
in
anything,
justice
black.
we
don't
have
to
meet
--
don't
have
to
go
quite
that
far,
sir,
for
this
reason.
we
are
arguing
that
in
any
event
before
an
unrestricted
authority
maybe
issued,
that
at
least,
the
commission
must
find
that
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
which
justify
its
issuance.
here,
the
commission
made
a
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
i
would
think
so,
but
we
don't
even
have
to
reach
that
point
because
here,
the
commission
made
a
specific
finding
that
there
were
no
exceptional
circumstances
by
using
all
the
phrase
on
usual
conditions,
but
those
two
phrases
are
synonymous
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
we
think
that
at
least,
the
ata
case
stands
for
the
proposition.
but
before
the
commission
may
validly
issue
an
unrestricted
certificate,
it
must
find
that
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
which
justify
departure
from
its
usual
policy.
it
not
only
didn't
find
any
exceptional
circumstances,
here,
it
found
precisely
to
the
contract.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no,
sir.
i'm
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no,
sir.
i'm
considering
it
synonymous.
the
commission
found
here
specifically
that
there
were
no
unusual
conditions
in
this
case.
now,
i'm
considering
in
that
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
it's
at
the
--
it's
at
--
it's
at
page
31
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
black.
you'll
note
there
through
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
commission
says,
“in
the
absence
of
any
showing
of
unusual
conditions
in
these
proceedings,
etcetera.
now
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
to
me,
that
means
the
same
as
if
the
commission
had
said
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
of
exceptional
circumstances.
i
think
that
means
that
there
are
no
unusual
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
obviously,
the
majority
of
the
commission
thought
that
it
was
justified
in
doing
what
it
did.
i
don't
deny
that.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
i
think,
it's
almost
automatically.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
that
the
words
are
--
they're
synonymously
as
they
might
as
well
have
said
in
the
absence
of
any
unusual
exceptional
circumstances.
every
permit,
every
certificate
as
issued
to
any
carrier,
has
some
limits
on
it.
and
i
think
it's
getting
way
off
into
a
semantical
argument
to
say
that
because
a
man
can't
serve
every
point
in
the
country,
he's
been
given
a
restricted
certificate
and
certainly
even
if
a
term
be
used,
he
hasn't
been
given
an
auxiliary
and
supplemental
certificate.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
pacific
motor
trucking
company.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
and
that
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
and
the
whole
nub
of
our
argument
is
that
a
mere
territorial
restriction
to
points
throughout
the
vast
system
of
the
southern
pacific
railroad
does
not
satisfy
the
congressional
policy
here
involved.
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
usually
at
the
same
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
read
it
that
way.
i
read
it
as
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
don't
read
it
that
way
at
all,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
as
i
read
it,
it
means
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
by
the
applicant
that
there
are
any
unusual
conditions
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
we
will
impose
a
territorial
limitation,
which
as
i
say,
is
really
no
restriction
at
all.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
in
many,
many
cases
in
which
railroads
or
the
subsidiaries
have
filed
applications
before
the
commission,
they
have
come
in,
in
the
first
instance
and
specifically
laid
out
restrictions
which
they're
willing
to
accept.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
of
course,
in
this
first
instance,
they
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
--
yes,
they
are.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
made
it
precisely
to
the
contrary.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
in
any
event,
it
is
our
contention.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
of
course,
there
is
no
question
here
that
general
motors
prefers
to
use
pacific
motor
trucking
company.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
that's
undoubtedly
one
of
their
bases
for
their
ultimate
holding
and
we
point
out
on
brief
in
case
after
case
that
the
commission
has
consistently
held
that
when
they
have
preference
of
the
shipper
for
the
use
of
a
particular
carrier.
and
this
is
a
case,
it's
involving
independent
carriers
where
there
are
no
disabilities
such
as
there
are
in
the
case
of
rail
subsidiaries.
we
point
out
on
brief
case
after
case,
in
which
the
commission
has
held
that
the
mere
preference
of
the
shipper
for
the
use
of
a
particular
carrier
is
not
grounds
for
granting
the
authority
sought.
we
believe,
in
short,
that
because
of
the
failure
to
show
any
exceptional
circumstances
here
that
the
commission
really
had
only
two
alternatives.
it
could
have
denied
this
application
all
together
or
it
could
have
limited
it
to
the
so-called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
service.
it
didn't
either.
it
simply
grant
them
the
rail
subsidiary
authority
to
perform
the
same
operations
which
would
be
--
be
performed
by
an
independent
motor
carrier
and
entirely
revolves
from
the
operations
of
the
rail
parent.
now,
in
that
brief
in
the
ata
case
in
this
court,
the
independent
motor
carrier
interest
there
involved,
complained
to
this
court
that
the
commission's
current
administration
of
the
act
indicated
that
if
it
had
forgotten
about
its
obligation
which
this
court
set
forth
in
its
partner
decision
in
326
u.s.,
the
guard
against
monopoly
in
his
field.
and
the
appellants
there
asked
this
court
to
forcefully
remind
the
commission
of
this
mandate
and
to
require
it
to
conform
to
it.
now,
this
court
declined
to
do
that
in
that
case
because
of
the
special
circumstances
which
i've
already
adverted
to.
but
you
said
this,
“finally,
if
under
our
interpretation,
a
loophole
exists
in
the
act,
the
commission
has
shown
no
information
to
permit
it
to
use
of
such.
should
the
commission
prove
to
be
less
stringent
in
the
future,
appellants
not
only
have
recourse
to
the
congress,
but
also
to
the
courts
for
review
of
the
commission's
finding
that
special
circumstances
exist.”
now,
that
very
last
phrase
there
suggests
that
before
the
commission
can
issue
an
unrestricted
certificate,
it
must
make
a
finding
that
special
circumstances
exists.
how
else
can
people
come
here
as
we're
doing
today
and
asking
--
ask
for
a
review?
and
it's
precisely
because
we
believe
the
commission's
decision
here
creates
a
loophole
big
enough
to
drive
the
largest
locomotive
through.
and
is
--
then
in
doing
so,
it
simply
floats
this
court's
ata
decision
both
its
spirit
and
its
luck
that
we're
here
before
you
today.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
oh,
yes.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
we
do.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
we
would
ask
that
on
brief,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i'm
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
we
would
ask
that
on
brief
and
our
briefs
are
not
a
part
of
the
record
here
before
the
commission
if
that's
what
you
mean.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no,
sir.
i
think
you
can
determine
when
you
do
read
the
record.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
i
can't
frankly
recall
right
now,
what
we
proposed,
but
what
i
would
say
is
this
that
when
you
do
read
the
record,
you
will
have
no
doubt
in
your
mind
from
what
the
commission
says
about
our
contentions
as
to
what
we
were
asking
it
to
do.
now,
before
i
come
to
the
commission's
rationale
underlying
its
grant
of
this
unrestricted
authority
here,
i
want
to
go
back
a
minute
to
what
it
said
in
the
case
before
it
which
ultimately
became
the
sub
nomine
this
court,
the
ata
case.
that's
the
issue
and
that's
the
case
in
which
the
rock
island
was
involved.
the
commission
in
that
case
prefer
to
its
policy
of
imposing
five
so-called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
in
grants
of
authority
at
the
railroads
or
their
affiliates.
and
it
said
this,
“this
policy
was
and
is
sound
and
should
be
relaxed
only
where
the
circumstances
clearly
establish
first,
that
the
grant
of
authority
has
not
resulted
and
probably
will
not
result
in
the
undue
restraint
of
competition.
and
second,
that
the
public
interest
requires
the
proposed
operation
which
the
authorized
independent
motor
carriers
have
not
furnished
except
where
it
suited
their
convenience.”
notice
the
commissions
report
here
does
nothing
else.
we
submit
that
it
attest
to
its
rather
short
memory.
it
made
the
first
finding,
i
just
referred
to
even
though
its
report
here
perpetuates
and
broadens
the
monopoly
which
already
exist
that
these
general
motors
plants
and
which
is
enjoyed
by
the
southern
pacific
rail
motor
combined.
but
it
couldn't
make
the
second
finding
regarding
the
failure
of
independent
motor
carrier
to
furnish
service,
because
as
i
stated,
the
independent
carriers
here
are
willing,
ready,
able,
indeed,
anxious
to
do
business
with
general
motors.
nevertheless,
the
commission
wants
a
hand
and
it
relaxed
its
policy
in
this
case
to
precisely
the
same
extent
as
it
did
in
the
ata
policy.
and
in
doing
this,
it
made
these
two
observations.
first,
it
said
it
couldn't
impose
the
usual
restrictions
in
this
case
because
if
it
did
so,
it
would
be
authorizing
common
rather
than
contract
carriage,
which
had
been
applied
for.
now,
as
we
point
out
on
brief,
the
commission
hasn't
been
nearly
as
solicitous
when
independent
motor
carriers
had
been
before
it.
it
has
often
issued
one
type
of
authority
when
another
has
been
requested.
and
as
we
also
point
out
and
the
commission
agrees
with
us
in
its
brief,
at
page
21
of
its
brief,
that
there's
little
distinction
between
common
and
contract
carriers
in
the
automobile
transport
field.
plus
the
commission
here
could
well
have
authorized
pmt
to
provide
a
common
carrier
service
and
having
done
that,
it
could've
imposed
restrictions
designed
to
limit
that
service
to
auxiliary
and
supplemental
operations.
now,
they
admitted
that
kind
of
authority
would
not
have
been
acceptable
with
general
motors.
and
in
the
final
analysis,
we
contend
that
the
commission
simply
bowed
its
neck
and
did
what
general
motors
wanted
it
to
do.
now,
the
other
reason
which
the
commission
gives
to
justify
its
departure
from
its
usual
policy,
despite
its
finding
that
no
unusual
circumstances
had
been
shown,
is
really
all
we're
doing
here
is
simply
allowing
the
southern
pacific
railroad
to
transport
the
use
of
motor
trucks
in
the
service,
to
transport
automobiles
where
it
has
formally
used
its
railcars.
well
now,
this
philosophy
i
think
will
completely
emasculate
the
congressional
policy
that's
involved
here.
after
all,
if
all
the
railroad
has
to
do
in
order
to
get
motor
truck
authority,
all
along
its
line,
is
simply
to
show
that
it's
presently
moving
traffic
in
railcars
and
every
railroad
in
the
country
is
in
business
as
a
motor
carrier
to
points
all
over
its
system
without
any
restrictions
at
all.
and
every
railroad
in
the
--
railroad
in
the
country
could
pick
its
largest
shippers
and
its
choicest
traffic
and
simply
go
into
the
motor
carrier
business.
now,
if
that's
all
this
congressional
policy
needs,
there's
been
a
lot
of
water
over
the
dam
over
something
that
doesn't
to
a
hill
of
beans
in
the
final
analysis.
we
think
it
means
a
lot
more
than
that.
really,
in
the
final
analysis,
here's
what
the
commissions
order
tells
the
railroads
of
the
country.
it
says
first,
if
you
can
prove
on
all
the
ata
case,
that
the
independent
motor
carriers
in
the
area
in
which
you
want
to
perform
unrestricted
trucking,
are
dodging
their
responsibilities,
failing
to
provide
inadequate
service,
come
in
and
file
a
common
carrier
application.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
case,
we
will
be
able
to
give
you
unrestricted
rights.
but
it
says
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
can't
show
that
the
independents
are
--
are
doing
a
poor
job,
if
they
appear
to
be
rendering
inadequate
service,
why
come
in
and
ask
for
contract
carrier
rights
and
we
will
give
you
those
unrestricted,
because
we
wouldn't
want
to
attach
restrictions
to
those
kind
of
rights
because
then
we
--
making
common
carriers
out
of
you
and
we
shouldn't
do
that.
and
as
we
read
this
case,
the
commission
in
a
very
real
sense
has
simply
consigned
the
congressional
policy
here
in
the
limbo
and
certainly
not
because
of
any
change
in
the
law
at
all.
now,
the
argument
is
made
on
brief
and
it's
going
to
be
made
across
before
the
court
that
in
reality,
the
authority
has
--
has
been
granted
is
restricted.
pmt
and
general
motors
and
their
joint
brief,
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
territorial
limitation
imposed
by
the
commission
amounts
to
an
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restriction.
but
we
think
that
the
term
is
too
well-known
in
the
court
decisions
and
we
think
it
means
that
the
operations
have
to
be
tied
in
with
the
rail
service.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
claim
by
general
motors
and
pmt
simply
doesn't
hold
water.
but
further
of
what
the
commission
refers
to
as
a
territorial
limitation
is
a
restriction
or
not,
we
certainly
submit
that
it
does
not
and
cannot
satisfy
the
congressional
policy
against
the
lying
railroads,
complete
freedom
to
get
into
the
trucking
business,
because
that's
what
this
is
in
the
final
analysis.
we
think
that
the
two
reasons.
first,
we
think
--
think
it
because
of
common
logic.
and
next,
we
believe
the
commission's
own
decision
support
this
view.
i
think
the
court
will
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
railroads
of
the
country
and
the
aggregate
serve
just
about
every
point
of
any
commercial
importance
at
all.
now,
if
merely
limiting
them,
the
points
on
their
line
complies
with
the
congressional
policy
here,
are
then
the
independent
motor
carriers
of
the
country
are
going
to
find
themselves
confronted
throughout
all
the
railroad
system,
with
railroads
operating
its
railroads
on
the
one
hand
and
an
unrestricted
truck
service
on
the
other.
though
there'll
be
a
few
hamlets
here
and
there,
small
towns
that
aren't
important
enough
to
want
being
on
any
railroad
line,
where
the
trucks
may
not
encounter
that
kind
of
dual
competition,
but
they
would
be
very
small
and
very
few
and
far
between.
that's
the
logic
of
it.
now,
the
commission
itself
long
ago
has
--
in
1946
and
it's
quite
my
decision,
completely
refuted
the
contention
that's
made
here.
then
they
referred
that
to
the
earlier
barker
decision
and
they
said
this
and
i'm
quoting,
“there
also
appears
to
have
developed
a
tendency
in
rail
motor
acquisition
proceedings
to
treat
the
barker
case
restrictions
as
geographical
or
territorial
only
in
their
intent
rather
than
substantive
limitations
upon
the
character
of
the
service.”
and
there,
the
commission
emphasized
that
word,
“service”
which
might
be
rendered
by
a
railroad
or
its
affiliate
under
any
acquired
right.
now,
in
our
brief
here
at
pages
33
and
34,
we've
quoted
the
opening
and
closing
paragraphs
of
a
rather
lengthy
discussion
in
the
commission's
white
line
decision
on
this
point.
and
if
i
may,
i
just
like
to
repeat
here
the
most
significant
portion
of
the
last
paragraph
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief.
the
commission
said
this,
“it
is
clear
that
any
tendency
to
treat
the
barker
case
as
an
approval
of
future
rail
motor
operations
which
should
be
unrestricted
except
territorially,
ignores
the
clear
declaration
that
certain
types
of
operations
are
disapproved,
wherever
conducted,
and
must
bring
from
a
misinterpretation
of
the
intent
of
the
reports
therein,”
referring
back
to
its
barker
decision.
in
its
brief
here,
the
commission
makes
no
mention,
whatever,
of
the
white
line
case.
in
their
joint
brief,
pmt
and
general
motors
however,
we
think
by
quoting
out
of
context
attempt
to
leave
the
impression
that
the
commission
was
endorsing
the
idea
that
a
territorial
limitation
was
all
it
was
needed
to
conform
to
congressional
policy.
now
that,
of
course,
is
really
the
very
antithesis
of
the
commission's
conclusion
reached
in
the
white
line
case.
the
commission
report
here
says
that
it
reserves
the
right
to
impose
in
the
future
and
i
quote,
“any
conditions
or
restrictions
which
may
then
appear
to
be
necessary
or
desirable
in
the
public
interest.”
you
will
note
even
in
that
reservation,
they
don't
refer
to
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions.
now,
certainly,
this
reservation
isn't
a
restriction
as
of
now.
and
in
addition,
if
the
commission
is
correct
in
saying
in
its
report
here
that
it
can
impose
the
usual
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restriction
because
to
do
so,
what
convert
these
operations
from
contract
to
common
carriage
which
is
not
what
the
applicant
wants,
then
obviously,
if
they
can't
do
it
now,
they
can't
do
it
anytime
in
the
future
either.
so
the
reservation
is
a
meaningless,
we
think,
phrase.
so
we
believe
in
the
final
analysis
entirely
aside
from
the
technical
semantical
distinctions
and
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
to
authorize
unrestricted
operations
by
this
railroad
subsidiary
without
any
finding
that
such
operations
are
justified
because
of
exceptional
circumstances
and
indeed
in
the
teeth
of
a
finding
just
of
contrary.
in
so
doing,
we
think
that
commission's
decision
ignores
a
clearly
discernible
guidepost
which
this
court
laid
down
for
it
in
its
ata
decision.
i
see
that
my
share
of
the
time
is
moving
along.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
come
next
to
the
issue
of
standing
to
sue
here.
that
issue
is
raised
only
by
pmt
and
general
motors,
a
permission
has
never
challenged
their
standing
to
sue.
the
basis
for
the
argument
seems
to
be
this.
in
the
proceedings
before
the
commission,
general
motors
steadfastly
took
the
position
that
no
matter
what
happened,
even
if
the
application
were
denied,
none
of
these
independent
motor
carriers
who
were
protesting
the
application
are
going
to
get
any
of
its
business.
now,
of
course,
it's
either
the
court
below
gave
a
good
bit
of
credence
to
that
and
certainly
the
appellees
do,
the
words
of
the
general
motors'
witnesses
are
really
treated
almost
as
the
laws
of
the
medes
and
the
persians.
and
the
argument
is
made
that
if
you're
never
going
to
get
any
business
in
general
motors
issue
now,
then
you
can
--
and
suffered
any
damage.
you
haven't
suffered
any
damage,
even
though
you
have
no
standing
to
sue.
it's
interesting
to
know
that
the
district
court's
majority
here
which
did
accept
this
argument
said
that
if
the
complaint
had
been
found
by
qualified
party
in
interest,
all
of
the
plaintiffs
would've
had
the
right
to
intervene.
now,
we
simply
can't
imagine
who
would
be
qualified
parties
and
interest
and
entitled
to
test
the
validity
of
this
commission
decision
if
it
weren't
the
protest
in
carriers
before
the
commission,
if
not
them,
then
who?
and
what
the
decision
really
does
in
this
area
is
to
insulate
from
review
any
order
of
the
commission,
provided
only
that
the
supporting
shipper
who
was
before
the
commission,
of
our
general
motors
here
says,
“i'm
not
going
to
give
you
any
business
no
matter
what
happens.”
and
the
argument
would
be
made
subsequently
when
review
were
sought
that
well,
you
were
told
you
wouldn't
get
any
business
and
so
there's
no
reason
for
you
to
go
to
court
because
you
haven't
been
damaged.
i
supposed
general
motors
here
instead
of
taking
the
attitude
it
did
had
said
that
if
the
application
were
denied,
some
of
the
protestants
would
be
used
by
it,
then
i
think
presumably,
these
same
protestors
would've
then
had
the
right
to
go
to
court,
because
that
would've
been
considered
to
be
damaged
--
damaged
and
therefore,
given
them
a
standing
to
sue.
so
that
in
a
real
sense,
the
attitude
of
this
supporting
shipper
before
the
commission
here
is
taken
as
--
a
--
let's
put
it
this
way,
that
the
supporting
shipper
is
really
given
a
right
by
a
virtue
of
its
attitude
to
determine
whether
or
not
there'll
be
any
court
review
of
the
commission
decision
depending
on
how
it
goes.
the
next
point
i'd
like
to
touch
on
is
the
holding
of
the
court
below
that
special
circumstance
and
justified
a
grant
of
authority
here.
the
court
said
this
at
page
81
of
the
record,
“thus,
although
the
commission
found
an
absence
of
unusual
conditions
which
would
justify
the
issue
of
sub
permits
for
service
to
points
and
not
on
sps
rail
line.
there
was
in
the
court's
opinion
substantial
evidence
or
special
circumstances
justifying
the
extension
of
pmt's
contract
carrier
authority
to
serve
gm.
we
think
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
that.
first,
in
effect,
it
overrules
the
commission's
finding
and
no
unusual
--
no
unusual
conditions
and
constitutes
a
substitution
of
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
commission
without,
in
any
way,
elaborating
wherein
the
commission
was
wrong
or
wherein
it's
committed
any
error,
that
second
and
we
think
more
importantly,
the
matters
which
the
court
found
to
constitute
evidence
of
special
circumstance.
the
fact
that
pmt
had
used
the
intrastate
service
in
california
for
many
years,
the
fact
that
the
operations
were
closely
coordinated,
the
possibility
of
confusion
and
disarrangement
at
general
motors
plants
of
other
carriers
were
used.
and
finally,
the
alleged
need
to
meet
the
competition
of
ford
and
chrysler.
these
matters
were
all
within
the
control
of
general
motors.
and
general
motors
knew
certainly
no
one
would
believe
that
they
don't
have
a
competent
counsel.
new
years
ago
that
a
motor
subsidiary
of
a
railroad
was
under
a
specific
disability
by
virtue
of
the
very
provisions
of
the
act
and
so
as
we
see
it,
if
there
is
any
annoyance
by
virtue
of
a
denial
of
authority
here
as
far
as
general
motors
is
concerned,
that
again,
we
believe,
there's
no
reason
to
kick
a
hole
in
this
congressional
policy
which
is
we're
afraid
if
it
has
many
more
holes,
it's
going
to
be
more
of
a
seal
than
a
policy.
we
think
also
that
the
court
below
in
attaching
any
significance
at
all
to
the
amendments
in
section
209,
of
the
act
of
1957,
we
think
it
was
incorrect
in
attaching
any
significance
to
those
amendments
at
all.
you'll
recall
that
this
court
in
the
contract
steel
carriers
case
in
1956
held
that
motor
carriers
were
free
to
aggressively
search
for
new
business
within
the
limits
of
their
license
and
that
just
didn't
jive
with
the
commission's
idea.
the
commission's
believed
that
any
contract
carrier
which
had
as
many
contracts
as
the
carrier
there
did.
i
had
in
reality
converted
its
operations
to
common
carriage,
so
it
sought
legislations
to
overcome
the
effects
of
this
court's
contract
steel
carriers
decision.
and
in
1957,
the
congress
enacted
just
such
legislation.
we
therefore
dealt
with
that
in
a
good
deal
of
--
detail
on
brief.
we
think
the
legislative
history
of
that
matter
shows
clearly
that
all
that
congress
intended
to
do.
as
commissioner
clark,
put
it
and
in
testifying
in
favor
of
the
bill,
was
simply
to
restrict
the
opportunity
of
contract
carriers
to
solicit
customers
without
restriction.
we
don't
believe
congress
in
any
way
intended
to
alter
its
traditional
policy
against
allowing
railroads
to
get
into
the
truck
field.
there's
nothing
in
the
whole
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
and
i
don't
need
to
dwell
on
the
rule
against
repeal
by
implication
here.
finally,
we
think
the
commission
erred
in
allowing
this
authority
because
of
dual
operations
provisions
of
the
law,
which
say
that
unless
good
cause
is
shown,
the
commissioner
shall
not
allow
the
performance
of
both
common
and
contract
carriage
by
the
same
person.
now,
when
this
aspect
of
a
case
was
first
considered
before
these
four
cases
were
consolidated
in
the
first
sub
34
report,
the
commission
pointed
out
that
the
specific
language
of
a
statute
dealt
only
with
transport
by
motor
carriers,
but
it
said
we
would
be
remiss
in
our
obligations
if
we
didn't
consider
the
spirit
of
this
legislation
and
consider
the
fact
that
the
common
carrier
here
by
rail,
is
a
--
that
the
southern
pacific
serves
in
a
dual
capacity
as
a
common
carrier
by
rail
and
as
a
contract
carrier
by
motor
vehicle.
and
it
then
went
on
in
its
--
in
its
first
report
to
admonish
pmt
for
its
failure
to
really
introduce
any
evidence
at
all
to
meet
that
statutory
standard,
other
than
to
rely
upon
the
fact,
the
commission
in
its
earlier
decisions
had
authorized
it
to
conduct
dual
operations.
but
when
sub
37
cases
heard
over
a
year
after,
the
sub
34
case,
pmt
again
is
--
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
on
the
point,
even
the
self-serving
declarations
of
pmt's
employee
which
it
has
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
be
to
its
brief
and
which
it
claims
provides
ample
evidentiary
support
for
this
grant
of
dual
authority,
come
from
the
first
sub
34
decision
and
not
from
the
later
and
far
broader
sub
37
case.
now,
again
on
our
brief,
we
have
discussed
numerous
cases
in
which
--
which
involved
independent
motor
carriers
in
which
the
commission
held
that
the
mere
opportunity
to
engage
in
discriminatory
practices
and
i
stress
that
and
they
are
opportunity
not
as
actual
exercise
is
sufficient
to
warrant
disapproval
of
a
grant
of
dual
authority.
in
here
on
the
situation,
we
think
far
more
pregnant
with
opportunity
for
discriminatory
practices,
than
is
a
usual
case
where
only
motor
operations
are
involved,
where
the
commission
in
the
first
report
told
pmt
that
it
couldn't
rely
on
its
previous
grants
of
dual
authority
to
justify
such
future
operations
and
where
pmt
in
the
sub
37
proceeding
was
seeking
far
broader
authority
than
it
sought
in
the
sub
34
case
and
it
totally
ignored
the
commission's
warning
and
its
obligation
to
present
evidence
on
this
dual
authority
issue
nevertheless,
the
commission
granted
the
right
(inaudible).
and
we
believe
that
in
doing
that,
the
commission
violated
a
statutory
requirement
that
there
must
be
a
good
cause
shown.
if
we
have
any
time
left
over
after
mr.
solomon
finishes,
i'd
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
in
the
short
time
i
have
left,
i
want
to
see
if
i
can
take
a
few
other
shingles
off
the
back
of
the
rather
large
ethiopian
that's
still
down
there.
before
the
commission,
in
addition
of
the
motor
carrier
protesters,
there
were
six
railroad
protesters.
why
aren't
they
here?
because
the
commission's
decision
gives
them
exactly
what
they
wanted.
why
are
we
here?
we
got
what
(inaudible).
the
result
of
this
commission
decision
is
this.
the
traffic
that
used
to
lullaby
rail
out
of
the
southern
pacific
plants
to
points
of
the
southern
pacific
lines
and
other
areas
will
still
continue
to
move
that
way
and
be
interchanged
with
the
other
railroads.
they
have
lost
nothing.
they
are
protected,
the
motor
carriers,
despite
the
commission's
statement
that
they're
attempting
to
protect
them.
i
think
counsel
for
the
railroad
has
made
it
clear.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
pmt
has
been
given
contract
carrier
rights,
they
cannot
interchange
with
any
independent
motor
carriers
under
any
joint
rates
of
through
routes,
so
the
result
is
this.
the
traffic
that's
going
to
points
on
the
pmt
lines
continues
to
move
by
southern
pacific
motor.
the
motor
carriers
get
nothing
there.
the
traffic
is
going
to
points
of
the
southern
pacific
lines,
continues
to
move
by
southern
pacific
rail
and
interchange
with
the
other
rail
carriers.
now,
that
has,
to
us,
is
very
ironic
result.
here
is
a
policy
which
was
imposed
in
the
first
instance
that
protect
the
interest
of
independent
motor
carriers.
the
commission
has
thrown
the
interest
of
the
independent
motor
carriers
out
of
the
window
and
has
ended
up
with
protecting
only
the
interest
of
the
railroads
here.
the
commission
makes
it
clear,
i
think.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
that
the
independent
motor
carriers
couldn't
do
just
as
adequate
a
job
for
the
shipper
as
a
rail
--
as
a
rail
subsidiary
it
chooses
to
support.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir,
but
the
shipper
--
the
commission
has
held
in
many,
many
cases
that
in
their
preference
by
a
particular
shipper
for
the
particular
carrier
involved
is
not
enough
to
justify
grant
of
authority.
now,
the
commission
says
this,
at
page
27
of
the
record,
“on
the
other
hand,
use
by
general
motors
of
applicants'
proposed
service
on
a
state-wide
basis,
as
distinguished
from
just
the
points
on
the
sp
lines,
would
permit
southern
pacific
to
invade
the
territory
served
by
other
rail
lines.”
and
it
goes
on
to
say
it's
protecting
the
motor
carriers
too,
but
i
have
shown
you,
i
think,
that
it
doesn't
protect
them
at
all.
and
that's
precisely
the
reasons
that
commissioner
upheld
when
he
dissented,
said,
“in
essence,
the
majority
has
not
only
failed
to
file
a
congressional
policy
but
has
misapplied
the
congressional
mandate.”
it
has
protected
rail
protesters
against
invasion
and
competition.
it
has
failed
to
extend
protection
for
the
motor
carrier
protesters.
thank
you.
