justice

mr.
ginnane,
you
read
a
--
written
of
the
word,
conclusary
finding
on
page
20,
that's
the
read
evidence
reasonably
established
to
generals
motors
besides
a
personalized
service,
what
subsidiary
findings
of
--
of
there
which
show
what
that
personalized
service,
the
element
that
it
needs.
i
presume
many
competent
would
like
to
have
--
i
don't
know
if
that's
what
you
mean
by
that,
but
many
customers
would
like
to
have
a
personalized
service
as
the
state
instructed,
“go
to
their
doors
into
their
plants.”
it
be
great
for
them
many
can
answer
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
get
--
and
they
get
that
from
the
contract
carriers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
nature
of
the
special
service
that
this
company
can
deal
general
motors
according
to
the
fact
that
it
could
not
get
from
the
general
trucking
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
you
are
saying
is
as
i
understanding
it,
decide
to
get
each
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
any
--
that
the
contract
carrier
renders
a
special
contract
service,
interstate
service,
to
a
special
company
can
do
that
under
the
act
and
there's
no
reason
so
far
as
the
commission
why
that
cannot
be
done
by
a
railroad
common
carrier
--
a
railroad
contract
carrier
or
which
he
knows
of.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
the
only
special
circumstance
would
be
that
they
are
serving
who
they
want
to
serve,
and
i
understand
that
other
people
have
raised
the
question.
maybe
i'm
wrong
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
this.
if
you
don't
have
power
under
the
--
the
law
to
give
this
right
to
a
railroad
subsidiary,
the
contract
carrier
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
unless
you
show
that
they
can't
get
the
service
on
whether
they
--
they
are
seeking
to
limit
the
meaning
as
i
understand
it,
as
your
case
to
what
it
actualy
was,
and
you
were
saying
as
i
understand
it,
that
from
it
--
that
the
commission
can,
if
he
sees
fit,
let
railroad
subsidiary
contract
carriers
serve
one
shipper
as
they
do
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
there's
nothing
in
the
act
which
permits
the
desolate
example.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
see
why
and
maybe
it's
correct
--
i
can't
see
why
if
this
is
correct
that
the
amount
establishing
of
the
rule
at
any
railroad
which
has
–
any
railroad
can
through
an
affiliated
trucking
company,
contract
companies
that
needed
service
to
perform
intrastate
business
and
have
a
right
to
get
it
if
--
if
this
shipper
wants
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
and
i
guess
a
general
amount
in
effect
to
a
general
establishment
of
the
law
that
can,
which
--
which
maybe
the
--
which
maybe
the
existence
of
the
act.
i
might
say
it
can.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
this
--
be
bad
for
the
commission
to
get
the
contracts
of
the
contract
shipper
at
least
to
make
a
contract,
would
get
the
happiness
or
the
satisfaction
of
them,
to
serve
alon
their
line
only,
as
i
understand
it.
that's
what
your
--
that's
it
is
restricted
to
that
extent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
--
why
--
why
wouldn't
--
why
would
it
be
fair
for
the
commissions
to
allow
that?
the
one
shipper
is
not
allowed
to
another
railroad
business.
they
want
to
be
with
a
railroad
business,
if
that's
a
--
if
they
own
a
reason
that
you've
given
them
was
that
--
they
like
it
and
it's
a
good
reason.
and
in
commonsense
that's
a
good
reason
we're
they
are
good,
legally,
why
not.

(inaudible)
justice

you
mean

that?
