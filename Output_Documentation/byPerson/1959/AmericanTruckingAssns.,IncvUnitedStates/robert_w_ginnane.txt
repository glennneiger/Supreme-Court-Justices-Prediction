mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
sharing
the
appellees'
time
with
mr.
pierce,
who
will
argue
on
behalf
of
the
southern
--
of
pacific
motor
trucking
and
general
motors,
and
we
have
tried
to
divide
the
time
and
argument
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimize
repetition.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
contend
that
this
case
is
governed
that
the
commission's
order
should
be
sustained
under
that
american
trucking
association
case
as
applied
to
the
facts
in
this
case
as
to
the
shippers,
as
to
general
motors
special
--
or
specialized
need
for
pmt's
transportation
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
needs
of
a
particular
shipper.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
your
honors
can
read
the
ata
case,
at
least,
as
well
as
i
can,
so
i
would
like
to
devote
myself
primarily
to
the
facts
and
so
as
the
shipper's
need
for
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
say
to
the
--
well,
they
make
this
finding
and
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
it
from
the
record
on
page
20.
in
our
opinion,
the
evidence
reasonably
establishes
that
general
motors
requires
from
its
raymer
plant
--
that's
one
of
the
three
plants,
a
personalized
service
in
the
movement
of
its
automobiles
and
trucks.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
personalized
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
requires.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
from
--
from
its
raymer
plant,
a
personalized
service
in
the
movement
of
its
automobiles
and
trucks
similar
to
that
which
is
presently
being
rendered
by
applicant
from
other
points
that
is
from
other
general
motors
plants.
and
i
would
like
to
--
to
point
out
from
the
record
just
what
is
this
service
which
the
shipper
needs.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
a
similar
finding
was
made
as
to
one
of
the
other
plants.
but
it's
the
--
it's
essentially
the
same
finding.
and
--
and
the
shipper
need
is
admittedly
the
same
from
all
three
assembly
plants
in
california.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
the
commission's
deference
to
the
policy
underlying
5
(2)
(b).
i
think
i'd
be
able
to
persuade
you
that
general
motor's
proof
of
need
for
this
specialized
exclusive
service
was
at
least
as
great
for
the
points
which
were
not
rail
stations
on
the
southern
pacific
lines
as
for
those
points
which
were
that
if
this
had
been
an
application
by
a
non-rail
--
by
a
non-railroad
controlled
motor
carrier,
there
have
been
ample
basis
for
the
commission
to
have
granted
the
authority
sought
for
the
entire
eight-state
area
that
makes
it
very
clear.
that
except
in
--
under
circumstances
which
it
did
not
find
to
exist
here,
it
would
not
allow
a
rail
controlled
--
a
railroad
controlled
motor
carrier
to
depart
that
far
from
the
railroads
regular
service
area.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
commission
never
has
granted
an
application
as
broad
as
this
one
for
a
rail
controlled
motor
carrier
to
depart
this
far
from
the
railroad
lines.
and
it
is
a
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
because
in
the
preceding
--
on
the
preceding
page,
it
refers
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
will,
indeed,
sir.
now
here,
pmt
has
been
performing
extensive
contract
carrier
service
of
these
three
general
motors
plants
for
periods
ranging
back
to
1935.
practically
all
of
this
prior
contract
carrier
service
has
been
intrastate
to
california
destinations
pursuant
to
permits
issued
by
the
california
commission.
substantially,
all
the
transportation
from
these
three
assembly
plants
to
points
in
their
distribution
areas
outside
of
california
has
been
by
rail.
that
is
by
a
southern
pacific
railroad
and
its
rail
connections
such
as
union
pacific.
the
economics
of
this
is
that
for
some
years,
there's
been
a
steady
shift
from
the
rail
transportation
of
new
trucks
and
automobiles
to
highway
transportation
by
these
--
and
these
specialized
trailers
which
you
see
in
the
streets
and
on
the
highways
all
the
time.
automobile
dealers
including
gm
dealers
refer
the
faster
service
by
highway.
they
prefer
smaller
dealers
like
the
split
deliveries
which
are
more
feasible
with
highway
trailer
than
with
railroad
car.
the
result
is
that
highway
transportation
of
new
trucks
and
automobiles
has
a
competitive
factor
in
a
highly
competitive
industry.
now
these
assembly
plants
have
a
very
large
physical
outfit.
in
1955,
for
example,
the
general
motor
chevrolet
plant
in
oakland
produced
125,000
vehicles
incidentally
at
--
at
about
$2000
a
piece,
that
represents
an
output
with
a
value
of
--
of
$250,000,000.
and
its
raymer
plant
produced
122,000
cars.
the
product
is
valuable
and
it's
fragile.
and
we
all
know
from
our
experience
in
parking
lots.
the
product
is
bulky.
it
has
to
be
moved
promptly
not
only
to
meet
dealer's
competitive
needs,
but
just
to
get
it
out
of
the
plants.
the
oakland
plant,
for
example,
has
a
storage
capacity
equal
to
one-day's
productive
capacity.
each
automobile
plant,
not
just
gm
but
any
automobile
plant,
produces
a
great
variety
of
combinations
of
color,
model,
upholstery,
special
equipment
such
as
power
brakes.
and
each
assembly
line
tries
to
have
these
things
come
off
to
each
dealer's
order
of
4
or
8
or
12.come
off
pretty
much
simultaneously.
something
to
be
loaded,
get
on
the
box
car
or
on
a
trailer
and
simply
moved
out
of
the
way.
now
at
the
beginning
of
the
highway
transportation
of
motor
vehicles,
about
10
or
15
years
ago,
the
initiative
from
the
dealers
and
the
dealers
themselves
or
through
carriers
from
they
selected
would
go
to
the
assembly
plants
and
pick
up
their
cars.
and
very
shortly,
it
became
a
chaos
of
40,
50
or
100
motor
carriers
trying
to
pick
up
the
product.
the
result
was
that
the
automobile
manufacturer
generally
simply
took
charge
of
the
motor
carrier
delivery
of
their
product.
they
found
that
the
essential
coordination
of
their
production
lines
with
transportation
could
be
achieved
only,
but
if
they
worked
with
one
or
perhaps
two
or
three
carriers
who
could
completely
gear
their
operations
to
the
assembly
line
schedules.
some
of
the
motor
carrier
--
some
of
the
motor
manufacturers
prefer
to
use
common
carriers.
some
prefer
to
use
contract
carriers,
but
all
operate
only
through
one
or
a
few.
and
as
the
appellants
suggest,
the
services
are
specialized
and
--
and
for
such
a
small
number
of
shippers
that
there's
not
much
difference
between
common
and
contract
carriage
in
this
area,
but
with
one
major
exception.
the
contract
carrier
is
free,
but
the
common
carrier
is
not
to
dedicate
these
facilities
as
equipment
solely
to
the
use
of
one
shipper.
but
briefly,
a
motor
carrier
serving
an
automobile
assembly
plant
becomes
a
--
a
part
of
the
distribution
system
of
the
manufacturer.
the
record
here
shows
for
example
that
in
the
course
of
pmt's
prior
contract
carrier
service
for
general
motors,
it
is
advised
months
in
advance,
the
production
schedules.
it
is
even
given
advance
information
of
that
sacred
piece
of
information
on
the
automobile
industry,
new
model
changes,
so
the
equipment
can
be
modified
to
fit
the
new
models.
in
the
course
of
this
prior
service
is
the
--
that
going
back
to
1935,
pmt
has
established
its
receiving
yards,
physically
adjacent
to
the
storage
yards
of
these
three
plants.
and
the
practical
physical
nature
of
these
--
of
those
layouts
is
illustrated
by
charts
and
aerial
photographs
in
the
record.
so
it
was
against
this
background
that
general
motors
requested
pacific
motor
trucking
to
apply
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
motor
contract
carrier
authority
to
serve
the
entire
distribution
area,
now
that's
three
california
assembly
plants,
specially
tmg
applied
for
authority
to
transport
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
to
all
points
in
arizona,
idaho,
montana
although
only
from
south
plant,
now
that
on
new
mexico,
oregon,
utah
and
washington.
and
as
was
been
told
that
the
commission
granted
authority
to
serve
only
the
points
in
oregon,
nevada,
utah,
new
mexico,
and
arizona
which
are
stations
on
the
southern
pacific
railroad
and
of
course
that
was
a
drastic
limitation.
for
example
in
--
just
to
use
one
example
in
--
in
new
mexico,
that
--
that
amounted
to
a
denial
of
a
right
to
serve
albuquerque,
which
is
by
far,
the
largest
city
of
new
mexico.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
was
done
because
despite
the
findings
as
to
general
motor's
need
for
an
expansion
of
this
type
of
service,
which
it
was
already
getting
from
pmt,
the
commission
still
was
unwilling
and
could
not
find
there
a
justification
for
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
pardon?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
couldn't
find
such
complete
dependence
that
it
was
going
to
allow
pmt
to
go
away
outside
the
service
area
of
its
parent
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
this
--
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
findings
i've
made.
at
least,
i'm
willing
to
conjecture
this,
that
if
pacific
motor
trucking
had
not
been
controlled
by
a
railroad,
the
entire
authority
sought
would
have
been
granted.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
would
have
gotten
to
albuquerque,
in
washington,
idaho
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
commission
report
makes
that
clear.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
the
--
the
showing
of
need
from
the
record
was
not
of
--
of
the
shipper's
need
for
the
service.
it
was
certainly
not
less
great
for
the
non-rail
points
than
for
the
rail
points.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
arizona,
only
the
points
served
by
the
railroad
in
arizona.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now
the
--
the
service
authorized
in
each
of
the
findings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
and
the
service
in
arizona
is
limited
to
points
which
are
stations
in
the
southern
pacific.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
the
line
does
not
go
near
albuquerque.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
only
to
those
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
granted
in
oregon
only
as
to
the
points
which
are
stations
on
the
southern
pacific.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
doesn't
serve
washington.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
nor
idaho,
nor
montana.
it
--
it
denied
authority
to
serve
washington,
idaho,
and
montana
in
total
because
southern
pacific
doesn't
get
in
to
those
states
at
all.
and
as
of
the
five
states
in
which
it
did
grant
authority,
it
restricted
the
authority
to
points
already
served
by
the
southern
pacific
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
to
three
small
non-rail
points
in
nevada,
as
to
--
as
to
which
no
real
point
has
been
made
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
justice
black.
it
would
--
general
motors
is
completely
free
to
set
up
its
own
operation
to
deliver
all
of
its
products.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
restricted
to
carrying
its
own
products.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
recall
--
i
recall,
sir,
but
if
--
if
they
did
it
directly
without
going
to
a
separate
corporate
shop,
they
could
certainly
do
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
common
carriers
of
the
country
both
rail
and
motor,
have
viewed
a
dramatic
growth
in
such
private
carriage
as
it
is
called
as
the
greatest
threat
to
public
transportation,
a
tremendous
increase
in
that
sort
of
so-called
private
carriage.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
think
so.
as
far
as
i
know,
they
use
various
combinations
of
contract
carriage
or
common
carriage
or
solely
contract
carriage
as
in
the
case
of
particularly
general
motor
chevrolet
division.
we
think
it's
significant
that
california
has
three
times
the
total
the
population
of
arizona,
nevada,
new
mexico,
oregon
and
utah,
even
without
subtracting
the
non-rail
points.
that
we
think
it's
clear
as
we
pointed
in
our
brief
that
most
of
pmt's
motor
carrier
service
for
gm
will
continue
to
be
intrastate
service
in
california.
and
that
is
that
these
interstate
operations
are
distinctly
a
minor
part
of
the
total
operation.
now,
the
sole
contention
in
this
part
of
the
case
is
not
that
general
motors
doesn't
need
motor
transportation
service
or
that
contract
carrier
service
is
not
an
appropriate
form
of
service,
but
simply
that
pmt
cannot
be
allowed
to
perform
it.
now,
we
think
this
court
made
it
clear
in
ata
that
the
specific
limitations
that
provides
on
section
5
(2)
(b)
are
not
to
be
applied
when
the
commission
is
authorizing
new
service.
in
the
court's
words
which
we
think
embodied
the
whole
thing,
we
conclude
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
rigid
requirement
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
to
be
considered
as
a
limitation
on
certificates
issued
under
section
207.
we
repeat
that
the
underlying
policy
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
must
not
be
divorced
from
the
proceedings
for
new
certificates
or
as
in
this
case,
new
contract
carrier
permits.
now,
we
can
admit
that
the
commission
cannot
ignore
that
policy.
we
simply
say
that
the
commission
has
a
rather
broad
discretion
in
determining
how
do
we
effectuate
it
and
what
did
it
do
here.
it
was
acting
solely
in
response
to
the
specialized
massive
needs
of
one
shipper,
general
motors.
general
motors
demonstrated
their
need
and
none
of
these
facts
as
to
--
as
to
the
shipper's
need
for
service
are
disputed
in
this
case,
never
have
them.
a
need
for
a
specialized
motor
service
completely
synchronized
with
its
production
line
schedules
wherein
an
immense
value
of
product.
it
was
already
obtaining
intrastate
service
from
pmt
for
the
great
bulk
of
the
production
of
its
three
california
plants.
now,
i'd
like
to
illustrate
about
a
large
portion
of
this
whole
operation
is
intrastate.
taking
one
plant
alone,
the
raymer
plant
in
los
angeles,
the
chevrolet
plant,
77%
of
its
1955
production
were
delivered
to
california
points.
and
of
that
77%
of
its
total
production,
100%
was
delivered
by
pmt
in
intrastate
service.
77%
of
the
south
gate
plant
was
thrown
entirely
in
california
and
pmt
delivered
65%
of
that.
so
to
a
certain
extent
and
i
don't
want
to
exaggerate
it,
but
to
a
certain
extent,
the
intrastate
service
in
traffic
here
involved,
is
the
tale,
a
rather
healthy
tale
to
be
true
of
a
large
intrastate
dock.
in
this
combination
of
intrastate
and
interstate
operation
in
a
single
carrier
even
though
controlled
by
a
railroad
in
order
to
provide
a
needed
shipper
service
was
one
of
the
major
elements
of
the
special
circumstances
which
this
court
recognized
and
sustained
in
the
ata
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
many
got
it,
sir.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
--
that's
the
whole
point
of
contract
carriage.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
do,
they
do.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
general
motors'
pmt
has
and
is
serving
only
one
automobile
manufacturer.
its
entire
contract
carrier
operations
are
devoted
to
one
commodity
automobiles
for
one
shipper,
general
motors.
its
fleet
of
specialized
equipment
is
completely
available
to
the
service
of
that
one
shipment.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
exactly,
it
would
be
illegal
for
it
to
completely
dedicate
its
equipment
to
the
service
of
one
shipper.
a
contract
carrier
on
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
completely
free
to
dedicate
its
equipment
and
efforts
to
the
service
of
this
--
only
one
shipper.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
surely.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
under
the
--
if
under
the
circumstances,
i
think
--
i
think
all
the
phrase
special
circumstances
mean
it
does
--
is
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
the
contract
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
want
the
--
and
what
the
commission
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
could
be,
could
be.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right,
sir.
i
think
general
motors
has
--
has
made
its
position
as
the
shippers
do
all
the
time
before
the
commission.
it
wants
to
deal
exclusively
with
one
contract
carrier
that
will
make
its
--
its
services,
its
equipment
exclusively
available
to
general
motors.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
i
--
and
i
have
tried
to
outline
some
of
the
evidence
of
their
needs
for
that
kind
of
service
as
--
as
supporting
the
commission's
findings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
never
has.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
mean
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
any
shipper
can
come
before
the
commission
and
say
well,
now,
if
you
--
if
you
--
we
are
supporting
the
--
the
application
of
applicant
a.
if
you
don't
grant
it
just
the
way
we
want
it,
we'll
go
into
private
carriage
ourselves.we
couldn't
--
we
couldn't
blackmail
like
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
they
say
they
aren't
going
to
divide
their
business.
they
say
they
aren't
going
to
divide
their
business
and
maybe
they
mean
it,
but
the
--
the
commission
can't
take
the
--
can't
react
in
response
to
that
sort
of
statement.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
need
and
convenience
to
the
shipper
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
what
other
needs
are
we
concerned
with
under
the
interstate
commerce
act?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
if
this
application
had
been
denied
in
toto,
the
appellant's
claim,
who
knows
what
general
motors
would
actually
do.
maybe
we
would
end
up
getting
some
general
motors
business.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
depending
upon
the
record
before
them,
what
the
proof
was.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
fact
that
general
motors
is
already
getting
service
from
pmt
from
most
of
the
output
of
the
--
of
at
least
three
assembly
plants
that
so
far
as
we
can
foresee
most
of
the
--
most
of
the
transportation
involved
in
delivering
their
product
at
least
three
plants,
will
continue
to
be
intrastate
service.
and
that
these
amounts
to
match
a
minority
expansion
of
that
service
into
interstate
commerce.
so
that
if,
this
shipper
with
its
specialized
needs
is
able
to
get
the
motor
carrier
service
at
once,
all
of
it
from
one
shipper
--
from
one
carrier,
the
moment
it
has
had
exclusive
dedicated
service
for
periods
of
time
going
back
to
1935.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
--
i
don't
think
anything
–
i
don't
think
anything
the
commission
said
in
its
report
in
this
case
establish
such
a
general
principle
that
the
shifting
--
well
the
shifting
shipper
--
shipper
habits
are
railroad
could
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
its
all
that
was
allowed
here,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
fact
--
because
the
facts
of
shipper
need
will
vary
from
case
to
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
here,
the
shipper,
is
already
getting
most
of
its
motor
carrier
transportation
requirements
which
are
intrastate
from
pmt
under
intra
--
under
intrastate
operating
authority.
and
the
--
the
combination
of
the
two,
the
interstate
relatively
minor,
and
intrastate
allows
this
shipper
with
its
huge
specialized
transportation
needs
to
get
it
all
from
one
contract
carrier,
pmt,
but
though
it's
have
been
dealing
out
of
satisfactory
basis
for
25
years.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
would
be
a
totally
different
case,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
would
--
it
would
certainly
not
be
the
demonstration
of
shipper
need
that
that
was
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
come
into
play
more
than
here
on
this
--
on
this
historical
set
of
facts.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
and
all
--
all
it
can
do.
the
pmt
will
be
running
these
trucks
to
these
interstate
destinations,
stations
on
the
railroad
in
the
--
in
the
same
--
in
the
same
way
that
an
independent
automobile
carrier
would
be.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
quite
correct,
sir.
the
destinations
are
not
limited
to
--
to
the
railroad
stations.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
it
quite
seem
–
may
--
may
i
answer
you
this
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
answer
you
this
way.
in
this
case,
the
commission,
it
seems
to
me,
was
striking
a
balance
between
this
particular
shipper's
need.
there
has
--
with
the
--
with
the
historical
background
against
statutory
policy
of
preventing
rail
domination
or
monopoly
of
motor
transportation.
it
seems
to
me
that
balance
might
be
entirely
different
when
a
new
shipper
for
the
first
time
is
saying,
i
don't
know
it.
i've
never
had
any
contact
with
this
rail
control
motor
carrier
before,
but
now
i'd
like
to
try
their
exclusive
contract
carrier
service.
they
would
take
--
it
would
--
it
would
take
quite
a
strong
shot
but
it
ought
to
be
a
different
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
with
pmt.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
it
would
be
a
different
balance
to
be
struck
between
shipper
need
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
difference
here
is
that
general
motors
--
our
period
is
going
to
back
to
1935,
has
been
utilizing
pmt
in
intrastate
service
for
the
transportation
of
most
of
the
output
of
these
three
plants
and
establish
working
relationship
years
old.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
might
indeed,
but
i
suggest
here,
that
this
established
relationship
and
all
that's
invalid
in
it,
is
one
of
the
factors
the
commission
could
take
into
a
--
into
consideration
and
distinguish
between
the
two
cases.
now,
i
think
the
balance
is
going
to
vary.
the
balance
between
shipper
need
and
the
policy
against
rail
domination
of
transportation
will
vary
with
the
facts
as
in
the
ata
case
and
as
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
make
one
more
point.
the
appellants
make
a
light
of
the
geographical
restriction
into
points
which
are
stations
on
the
southern
pacific
railroad.
i
can
only
suggest
if
the
restrictions
have
not
been
imposed,
they
would
really
be
complaining.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
the
language
of
the
district
court
into
which
they
adjust
themselves
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
in
the
record
at
page
81.
the
three-judge
court
said,
“thus,
although
the
commission
found
an
absence
of
unusual
conditions
which
would
justify
the
issuance
of
permits
for
service
to
points
not
on
sp's
rail
line,
there
was
in
the
court's
opinion,
substantial
evidence
of
special
circumstances
justifying
the
extension
of
pmt's
contract
carrier
authority
to
serve
gm.”
now,
from
that,
the
appellant's
contend
that
--
had
like
them
in
their
briefs
--
that
the
court
substituted
itself
for
the
commission
in
making
findings,
making
its
own
independent
findings
of
fact
or
we
think
that
read
in
context
for
all
--
all
of
it
--
all
the
three-judge
court
is
saying
that
we
think
there
were
substantial
evidence
of
sufficient
shipper
need
to
justify
the
commission
in
going
as
far
as
it
did.
and
that
was
authorizing
service
to
points
which
are
stations
on
the
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
which
would
justify
the
issuance
of
permits
for
service
to
points
not
on
sp's
rail
line,
and
the
commission
did
find
--
and
the
commission
did
find
that
there
are
not
in
your
presence
such
unusual
circumstances
no
matter
what
the
shipper's
need
as
would
want
letting
this
operation
go
beyond
the
rail
lines.
