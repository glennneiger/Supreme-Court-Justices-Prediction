justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
say
the
president
of
the
company,
you
mean
the
m.
&
m.
--
the
turpentine
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
in
that
sense,
i
maybe
wrong,
but
you
are
using
the
--
the
phrase,
“railroad
foreman”
for
the
purposes
of
identifying
mr.
keen.
is
that
not
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it's
agreed,
he
was
serving
them
in
the
capacity
of
employee
of
the
railroad?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
why
i
wanted
to
be
sure.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
it
show
what
you
had
paid
them
and
what
the
details
were
in
the
former
instances?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
the
cost
of
the
1350
feet
of
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
on
the
private
property
of
turpentine
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
--
may
i
ask
you,
is
that
all
the
court
did
in
--
is
trying
to
determine
as
a
predicate
to
a
defense
verdict,
namely,
it
required
--
requiring
that
the
man,
the
petitioner,
had
been
told
that
he
was
working
for
someone
else?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
that's
what
the
language
set
forth
by
the
fifth
circuit
during
at
page
of
167,
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
footnote
10.
certain
portions
of
the
court's
charge
concerning
the
requirement
issue
were
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
do
you
think
made
it
clear
to
him
has
the
same
significance
as
told?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
went
ahead
and
you
said
to
the
court
to
the
presence
of
the
jury,
“your
honor,
to
make
it
clear,
he
was
working
for
some
third
person,
not
working
for
the
railroad.”
and
the
court
said,
“yes,
sir.”
that
is
the
word,
i
believe,
you
suggested.
that
he
was
working
for
some
third
person.
now,
the
foreman
had
--
had
to
make
it
clear
to
him
that
he
was
working
for
some
third
person
and
not
the
railroad.
i
thought
you
said
that,
but
i
guess
there
is
no
doubt
as
much
as
he
wanted,
but
i
want
to
make
that
clear
to
you,
he
was
speaking
to
the
jury
there,
wasn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
if
you
find
in
this
evidence
that
he
was
so
advised
before
he
went
out
there
to
work
and
went
out
on
his
own
volition
and
joined
the
others
to
make
some
extra
money
and
he
was
not
an
employee
of
the
railroad
and
you
would
and
they
would
not
be
liable
and
so
forth.
that's
the
charge
and
this
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
charge?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
not
admitted,
however.
that's
--
that
was
denied
by
the
plaintiff,
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
sir,
was
there
any
exemption
taken
to
the
recharge
of
the
jury
after
--
at
counsel
--
what
petitioner's
request
during
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
the
accepting
taken
by
the
petitioner
that
recharge?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
know
he
asked
for
it
and
got
--
and
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
exception
--
