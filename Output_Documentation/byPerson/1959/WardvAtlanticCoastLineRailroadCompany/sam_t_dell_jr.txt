mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
your
honors.
justice
whittaker,
i
would
like
to
develop
further,
the
question
that
you
just
brought
up
with
counsel
and
that
it
is
our
contention
and
always
has
been.
they're
vigorous
--
that
the
trial
court
did
not
submit
the
case
to
the
jury
solely
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not,
the
petitioner
had
been
told
by
foreman
keen
that
he
would
not
be
working
for
the
railroad
that
day.
the
trial
court
went
further
and
you
will
find
at
two
places
in
the
trial
court's
instructions
to
the
jury
on
the
page
144
and
145,
which
your
honor
has
already
identified
as
well
as
on
page
153
of
the
record
where
after
the
jury
had
left
the
bar
of
the
court,
under
instructions
of
the
court
to
retire
and
consider
their
verdict,
they
were
recalled
into
the
courtroom
and
at
petitioner's
request,
the
matter
was
again
reemphasized
in
the
language
of
the
trial
judge
when
he
made
it
clear
to
them
that
they
not
only
had
to
find
that
the
petitioner
was
told
by
foreman
keen
that
he
would
not
be
working
for
the
railroad,
but
they
had
to
go
one
step
further
and
find
that
the
petitioner
understood
that
he
was
working
for
a
third
party.
and
that
is
the
point
that
we
argued
with
all
of
the
emphasis
that
i
could
master
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
--
when
i
said,
there
as
i
would
like
to
say
here
that
the
trial
court
put
a
double
barrier
in
between
the
railroad
and
its
ultimate
jury
verdict
when
it
said,
“you
must
find
that
he
was
not
only
told,
but
that
he
understood
that
he
was
not
working
for
the
railroad,
but
was
in
truth,
in
fact,
working
for
a
third
person.”
the
respondent
conceives
--
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
the
foreman
had
made
it
clear
to
him
that
he
was
working
for
some
third
person
and
not
the
railroad.
i
thought
i
had
said
it,
if
you
--
and
it
goes
on,
“if
you
find
from
the
evidence
that
he
was
so
advised
before
he
went
out
there
to
work
and
he
went
out
of
his
own
volition
and
joined
the
others
to
make
some
extra
money,
then
he
was
not
an
employee
of
the
railroad
and
they
would
not
be
liable.”
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
153.
i
was
reading
from
at
the
top
of
the
page
starting
“the
foreman
had
to
make
it
clear.”
now,
the
respondent
conceives
that
the
crux
of
this
case
is
whether
the
maintenance
of
a
privately
owned
spur
track
located
on
privately
owned
property,
for
the
convenience
of
the
private
owner,
is
a
vital
operational
activity
of
the
railroad
so
as
to
preclude
the
railroad
from
delegating
that
responsibility
of
maintenance
to
the
third
party
owner
of
the
track.
no
decisions
of
any
state
or
a
federal
court
have
been
found
nor
are
any
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
which
hold
that
the
doctrine
of
non-delegable
duty
should
be
applied
to
the
maintenance
of
a
purely
privately
owned
sidetrack
rather,
the
decisions
in
this
field
have
uniformly
applied
the
test
that
the
doctrine
becomes
applicable
only
when
the
evidence
demonstrates
that
the
function
being
performed
constitutes
a
part
of
the
railroad's
total
enterprise,
vital
to
its
operational
activities
and
essential
to
it
in
the
exercise
of
the
obligations
of
its
franchise.
this
court
has
held
that
some
functions
of
a
railroad
which
are
defined
as
vital
operational
activities
or
the
maintenance
of
the
mainline
tracks,
the
strengthening
and
stabilization
of
tracks
along
mainline
rights
of
way
and
the
switching
of
cars
in
terminal
areas.
no
case
has
been
found
and
no
case
has
been
cited
which
holds
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
railroad
to
maintain
a
purely
privately
owned
spur
track
and
that
duty
cannot
be
delegated
to
it
to
the
owner,
because
the
maintenance
of
such
track
constitutes
a
vital
operational
activity
of
the
railroad
to
whose
line
it
connects.
i
think
it
is
a
common
knowledge
that
railroads
everywhere,
in
rural
areas,
provide
the
necessary
sidetracks
and
spur
tracks
on
its
own
right
of
way
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
loading
and
unloading
of
freight
by
its
customers
in
those
areas.
here,
this
private
spur
track,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
located
on
the
land
that
was
owned
by
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company.
it
was
built
by
the
railroad
at
the
turpentine
company's
expense,
at
the
turpentine
company's
request
and
the
record
will
show
that
no
person
used
this
railroad
spur
track
other
than
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company's
own
employees
or
their
own
people
or
except
on
the
expressed
consent
of
the
president
or
executive
officers
of
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company.
now,
it's
true
that
150
feet
approximately,
of
this
spur
track
was
located
on
railroad
property.
that
railroad
property
was
that
part
of
the
railroad
mainline
right
of
way
on
which
this
spur
track
extended
as
it
left
the
mainline
track
of
the
railroad
to
get
to
the
common
property
line
of
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
and
then
to
go
forward
into
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company's
property
to
serve
the
lumber
mill
and
the
turpentine
steel,
thereon
located.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
[laughs]
correct
your
statement
in
just
one
thing.
they
did
not
make
the
arrangement
with
the
railroad.
we
very
vigorously
deny
that
that
arrangement
was
made
with
the
railroad,
true.
they're
under
the
condition
of
a
contract
in
which
the
sidetrack
was
initially
--
the
spur
track
was
initially
laid,
the
owner
undertook
the
responsibility
of
its
maintenance.
now,
in
your
case
that
--
that
you
cite,
in
--
the
sidetrack
had
been
laid
on
a
long
land
that
was
common
boundary
to
several
industrial
firms,
then
it
is
conceivable,
that
the
railroad
could
have
made
an
agreement
with
all
of
them
that
they
would
build
the
railroad's
spur
track
on
their
--
their
properties,
but
that
each
of
them
would
have
to
keep
the
track
in
proper
maintenance.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
in
front
--
in
front
of
their
property.
yes,
sir.
and
if
anyone
of
them
failed
to
do
so,
then
the
railroad
would
not
get
us
upon
that
track
with
its
trains
for
the
reason
that
it
owes,
of
course,
to
its
equipment
and
its
personnel,
the
obligation
not
--
not
to
take
it
across
or
them
across
dangerous
track.
so,
the
only
obligation
that
the
railroad
have
was
to
inspect
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
track
to
be
sure
that
it
was
safe
for
the
operation
of
its
trains.
and
if
it
was
so
safe
for
the
operation
of
its
trains,
then
they
could
go
over
it.
but
it's
--
i
think
the
important
here
for
me
to
reemphasize
the
point
that
this
track
was
never
used
by
shippers
in
the
area
without
the
prior
consent
of
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company.
the
railroad
company
recognized
the
complete
and
absolute
ownership
of
that
track
by
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company.
all
the
members
of
--
of
the
crew
that
worked
out
there
that
day
understood
that
it
belonged
to
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company.
they
knew
that
it
was
a
privately
owned
track
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
replete
and
uncontradicted
that
they
never
worked
on
privately
owned
spur
tracks
or
sidetracks,
except
on
the
days
when
they
were
not
in
the
course
of
their
regular
employment
with
the
railroad,
to
wit,
on
saturdays,
their
regular
day
off.
they
were
just
as
free
to
have
gone
to
the
watermelon
fields
and
work
picking
or
loading
watermelons
on
track
lines
on
saturday
as
they
would
have
been
to
work
on
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
track.
the
foreman
told
and
they
testified
that
they
understood
as
just
all
the
members
of
that
crew
except
the
petitioner
that
they
were
working
for
a
third
party.
they
all
knew
and
understood
that
it
was
a
privately
owned
track.
they
all
knew
and
understood
that
they
did
not
have
to
work,
unless
they
wanted
to
work
for
the
purpose
of
making
extra
money.
and
they
all
knew
and
understood
that
if
they
did
not
work,
if
they
did
not
agree
and
voluntarily
go
out
on
that
track
that
saturday
morning,
then
it
would
in
no
way
influence,
affect
or
jeopardize
their
job
with
the
railroad
in
any
respect,
whatsoever.
the
evidence
discloses
that
the
circumstance
in
this
case
obtains
exactly
to
that,
which
i
eluded
to
a
moment
ago
as
being
common
knowledge
among
all
men
that
railroads
generally
provide
these
unloading
facilities
on
their
own
tracks
in
rural
areas
for
the
benefits
--
benefit
of
their
customers.
and
how
can
it
be
said
or
seriously
contended
that
the
maintenance
of
a
privately
owned
spur
track,
the
use
or
non-use
of
which
can
have
no
practical
affect
upon
the
railroad's
total
enterprise
or
the
fulfillment
of
its
franchise
obligations,
should
impose
upon
the
railroad
a
non-delegable
duty
for
its
maintenance.
if
it
was
not
a
part
of
a
total
enterprise,
if
it's
not
a
part
of
the
railroad's
obligations
to
the
public
under
the
franchise
which
it
holds,
then
how
can
it
be
a
vital
operational
activity
that
was
defined
and
promulgated
by
this
court
in
the
sinkler
decision?
this
court
has
recognized,
in
other
cases,
the
right
of
a
carrier
to
avoid
liability
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
by
delegating
to
independent
contractors
various
functions
of
the
railroad
which
are
certainly
more
enterically,
a
part
of
the
carrier's
obligations
of
franchise,
or
its
total
enterprise
than
the
one
presented
in
this
case.
i
refer
to
one
case,
the
bond
case,
chicago
rock
island
&
pacific
railroad
versus
bond
where
this
court
recognized
the
right
of
a
carrier
to
delegate
to
the
independent
--
to
an
independent
contractor
the
right
to
load
and
unload
coal
on
its
locomotives
at
one
of
its
terminals.
and
held
that
an
employee
of
that
independent
contractor
who
was
hurt
while
loading
and
unloading
coal
on
the
locomotive,
belonging
to
the
railroad,
was
not
within
the
employ
of
the
railroad
so
as
to
avail
himself
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
we
contend
that
the
maintenance
of
the
privately
owned
spur
track
in
this
case
constitute
a
--
constituted
or
constructed
on
privately
owned
property
under
the
circumstances,
here
present,
can
be
lawfully
delegated
by
the
railroad
to
the
spur
track
owner
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
so
held
and
we
feel
that
that
decision
is
in
accord
with
every
decision
of
this
court
on
this
subject.
now,
i
think
it's
important
for
us
to
review
for
a
moment
the
undisputed
facts
in
this
case,
which
are
material
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not,
the
petitioner
was
working
for
the
railroad
or
as
its
employee
or
whether
it
was
working
for
the
--
an
agent
of
the
railroad.
the
evidence
is
undisputed,
discloses
that
the
spur
track
was
built
by
the
respondent
for
the
turpentine
company.
the
land
on
which
the
spur
track
was
laid
was
privately
owned
and
the
spur
was
built
at
the
expense
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
private
owner.
that
no
other
shipper
use
the
track
without
the
owner's
consent.
the
spur
connected
with
the
railroad's
tracks
was
used
in
the
interstate
commerce.
the
work
was
being
performed
on
saturday
by
some
of
the
members
of
the
section
crew
on
their
regular
day
off.
the
section
crew
had
completed
its
normal
40-hour
work
week
the
night
before.
tools
belonging
to
the
railroad
were
used
with
the
acquiescence
of
the
management
of
the
railroad
on
these
days
that
they
worked
on
private
sidetracks
and
on
this
--
on
the
saturday
morning,
herein
question,
all
of
the
employees
went
to
the
site
of
the
job
in
their
own
private
automobiles.
every
other
time
that
they
worked
for
the
railroad,
they
went
to
the
site
of
the
job
on
the
railroad's
motor
car.
the
men
working
for
the
--
on
their
privately
owned
track
were
always
paid
by
the
owners
of
the
--
of
that
track
and
on
this
instance,
will
pay
it
in
cash.
the
men
when
working
and
receiving
their
pay
for
the
railroad
were
always
paid
by
railroad
check,
which
they
received
twice
each
month.
the
owner
of
the
privately
owned
spur
track
furnished
the
crossties
which
were
used
by
the
crew
to
repair
the
track
and
mr.
mckenzie
made
the
arrangements
with
mr.
keen
to
have
the
work
done
and
mr.
--
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
so
far
as
the
record
discloses
your
honor,
it
--
it
had
not.
mr.
--
the
record
disclosed
that
mr.
mckenzie,
the
owner
of
the
track,
particularly
in
watermelon
season,
let
other
shippers
use
the
track.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
mr.
mckenzie
being
a
frugal
and
smart
businessman,
required
these
watermelon
shippers
to
put
up
the
money
with
which
to
repair
the
tracks
so
to
the
fact
that
served
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
for
the
rest
of
the
year
and
the
watermelon
shippers
during
the
watermelon
season
and
the
record
will
--
will
show
that.
the
facts
in
each
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
to
support
his
contention
that
he
was,
at
the
time
of
his
alleged
injury,
an
employee
of
the
respondent,
disclosed
that
the
injured
employees
were,
at
the
time
of
their
respective
injuries,
actually
working
for
the
defending
railroads
or
actively
engaged
in
the
furtherance
of
--
of
essential
operational
activities
of
the
railroads
as
the
employees
of
independent
contractors
engaged
by
the
defending
railroads
for
that
purpose.
now,
i
am
simply
overwhelmed
by
counsel's
insistence
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
sinkler
case.
counsel
suggests
that
under
the
thrust
in
--
of
sinkler
that
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
should
be
held
as
the
agent
of
the
railroad.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
in
legal
terms
what
the
word
thrust
means,
but
i
assert
that
--
that
thrust
--
that
counsel
talks
about
is
not
sufficient
to
launch
his
missiles
because
under
the
doctrine
and
the
rationale
of
the
court's
decision
in
the
sinkler
case,
there
was
no
showing
in
this
case
that
what
this
crew
or
this
man
was
doing
on
his
day
off
was
a
vital
operational
activity
of
the
railroad,
so
as
to
bring
him
within
his
intended
thrust.
the
sinkler
case,
as
we
all
know,
involved
an
injury
to
an
employee
of
the
railroad
who
was
actually,
at
the
time
of
his
injury,
working
in
the
course
of
his
employment
as
a
cook
on
the
car,
the
private
car,
of
the
general
manager
of
the
railroad.
that
car
was
being
shifted
in
the
terminal
area
in
houston,
texas
by
the
belt
railroad,
an
independent
contractor.
the
stock
of
which
was
largely
owned
by
the
railroad
which
was
being
sued.
and
the
court
held
that
the
negligence
of
the
employees
of
the
belt
railroad
in
jarring
the
car
in
which
sinkler
was
then
engaged
in
following
his
obligations
of
his
job
with
the
defending
railroad,
was
such
that
it
could
be
imputed
to
the
railroad
for
the
reason
that
the
shifting
of
cars
or
the
switching
of
cars
in
its
terminal
area
at
houston,
texas
was
a
vital
operational
activity.
and,
i
believe,
if
your
honors
please
that
justice
brennan
in
writing
that
--
that
opinion,
referred
at
least
three,
if
not
four,
times
to
the
language
vital
operational
activity
in
defining
what
the
switching
of
cars
were
in
the
terminal
area
of
the
railroad
in
houston,
texas.
now,
in
the
baker
case,
that
case
came
out
of
texas
and
was
recently
decided
by
--
by
the
court
and
there,
the
employee
was
the
employee
of
an
independent
contractor
employed
by
the
defending
railroad
for
the
purpose
of
grouting
along
its
mainline
right
of
way,
stabilizing
and
strengthening
the
roadbed
along
its
mainline,
certainly,
a
function
which
is
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
railroad
and
certainly
an
obligation
which
the
railroad
must
perform
to
live
up
to
the
responsibility
of
its
franchise.
however,
i
feel
that
the
only
thing
that
this
court
really
decided
in
the
baker
case
was
the
fact
that
when
you
have
conflicting
evidence
on
the
issue
of
employment
and
then
that
the
trial
court
should
submit
that
issue
to
a
jury
for
proper
determination.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
principle
of
law.we
think
it's
sound.
it's
followed
probably
in
every
state
in
the
united
states
and
throughout
all
of
the
federal
courts
that
wherever,
the
matter
is
a
question
of
fact
and
there
is
conflict
on
that
question
of
fact,
the
only
trials,
the
only
jurisdiction
where
that
can
be
determined
was
--
is
within
the
province
of
the
jury.
in
this
case,
the
respondent's
evidence
showed
that
the
petitioner
along
with
other
members
of
the
crew
were
--
were
told
before
they
undertook
to
repair
the
privately
owned
spur
track
on
their
day
off.
that
they
would
not
be
working
for
the
railroad
and
that
the
railroad
would
therefore,
not
be
responsible
for
their
safety.
the
respondent's
evidence
further
disclosed
that
the
men
working
on
that
saturday
morning
including
the
petition
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
absolutely.
he
had
to
deny.
otherwise,
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict,
as
a
matter
of
law
with
our
position,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
and
because
they
voluntarily
agreed
to
perform
that
work,
they
did
so
for
the
purpose
of
making
some
extra
money
and
they
agreed
on
the
time
when
and
the
place
where
they
were
going
to
meet
the
following
morning
to
do
the
job
and
--
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
that
would
have
raised
an
entirely
different
question.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
under
that
case,
but
even
then,
your
honor,
that
would've
raised
a
--
a
different
question
because
even
though
they
were
using
the
railroad
tools
by
and
with
the
acquiescence
of
the
railroad
manager,
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
positive
to
the
effect
that
the
tools
were
in
good
first
class
shape
at
the
time
--
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
know
you
weren't,
but
i
[laughs]
would
--
i
wanted
to
take
that
opportunity
to
make
that
additional
point.
all
of
evidence,
of
course,
was
--
all
of
these
evidence
about
--
about
volunteering
the
work
and
--
and
going
out
there
to
make
some
extra
money
and
that
he
knew
or
that
he
was
told
that
--
that
he
was
going
to
be
working
for
a
third
party,
he
denied,
but
the
jury,
under
appropriate
instructions
from
the
court,
found
against
the
petitioner
and
returned
its
verdict
for
the
respondent,
thus,
making
a
determination
of
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
not,
at
the
time
of
his
alleged
injury,
an
employee
of
the
respondent
working
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
the
petitioner
asked
for
it.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
there
was
no
exception
--
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
--
then
because
the
--
the
court,
in
effect,
did
exactly
what
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
asked
him
to
do
and
that
was
to
spell
it
out
from
the
jury
once
more
that
they
had
defined
that
the
petitioner
knew
that
he
was
working
for
a
third
party
and
not
the
railroad.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
--
he
refused
the
requested
charges
the
afternoon
before
during
--
during
the
conference
in
his
--
in
his
chamber.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
he
said
that
he
would
cover
it
and
he
told
them,
i
believe
that
he
would
give
--
he
would
not
give
the
charges
as
requested,
but
that
he
would
give
--
give
substantially
or
give
a
charge
that
would
cover
it.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
they
object
--
--right
to
--
mr.
rutledge
and
rather,
under
those
circumstances,
he
could
not
very
well
have
accepted
them
to
the
--
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
no,
sir.
because
he
got
exactly
what
he
asked
for
and
i
thought
he
got
a
little
too
much.
mr.
sam
t.
dell,
jr.
yes.
he
--
well,
he
got
it
what
he
--
he
asked
for
from
the
court,
but
not
the
jury.
that's
--
that's
--
yes,
sir.
and
in
this
margue
case
that
they
--
they
cite,
the
injured
employee
was
that
at
the
time
of
his
injury,
working
for
an
independent
contractor
employed
by
the
defending
railroad
to
maintain
its
tracks,
roadways
and
structures
of
--
are
function
which
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
determined
to
be
essential
to
the
exercise
of
its
franchise
rights.
in
addition
to
that
case
provided
that
the
defending
railroad
could
terminate
on
24
hours
notice
and
take
possession
and
control
of
the
work.
i
feel
that
of
--
this
brief
review
of
the
factual
aspects
of
the
cases
upon
which
the
petitioner
relies
in
contracts
with
the
facts
developed
at
the
trial
of
this
case
brings
into
sharp
relief,
the
facts
that
each
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
can
be
readily
distinguished
from
the
case
at
bar,
because
each
has
two
practical
elements
in
common
as
the
basis
of
the
rationale
of
the
court's
decisions.
in
each
case
cited
by
the
petitioner,
the
defending
railroad
had
firstly,
employed
the
independent
contractor
involved.
and
secondly,
delegated
to
the
independent
contractor
employed,
the
performance
of
a
function
which
was
essential
to
the
exercise
of
its
franchise
rights.
in
this
case,
the
owner
of
a
spur
track,
not
the
railroad,
engaged
the
petitioner
on
his
day
off.
and
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
it
cannot
be
seriously
contended
that
the
maintenance
of
a
privately
owned
spur
track
located
on
privately
owned
property
for
the
convenience
of
a
third
party
constitutes
a
function
vital
to
the
operation
--
rough
operational
activity
of
the
railroad.
in
the
two
minutes
or
so
remaining
to
me,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
trial
court
erred
in
refusing
petitioner's
requested
charges
concerning
the
criteria
which
are
usually
applied
in
determining
which
of
two
parties
is
a
given
individuals
employer
at
a
given
moment.
the
petitioner
endeavors
to
support
his
contention
on
this
issue
with
some
cases
involving
the
borrowed
servant
doctrine
and
with
other
cases
involving
the
incident
of
employment
doctrine.
when
an
employee
is
in
--
is
loaned
by
one
employer
to
another
without
the
knowledge
or
consider
the
employee,
it
is
obvious
that
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
standard
yardsticks
of
employment
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
employee
has,
in
fact,
changed
the
employer,
just
as
those
same
yardsticks
of
employment
must
be
used
to
determine
whether
an
employee
who
is
not
injured
or
who
is
injured
while
not
in
the
performance
of
actual
duties
for
his
employers,
nevertheless,
to
engage
in
some
activity
which
his
regular
duties
require.
the
testimony
of
the
respondent's
witnesses
who
worked
on
the
spur
track
on
that
saturday
morning
confirmed
the
fact
that
they
and
the
petitioner
were
told
that
they
would
not
be
working
for
the
railroad
that
day.
and
that
they
and
the
petitioner
voluntarily
agreed
to
repair
the
privately
owned
sidetrack
in
order
to
make
some
extra
money.
the
petitioner
denied
these
facts
at
the
trial
and
this
direct
conflict
in
the
testimony
made
a
clear
cut
issue
for
the
jury
and
the
trial
court
reduced
the
issue
of
employment
to
the
question
of
whether
the
petitioner
knew
he
was
working
for
some
third
person
and
not
the
railroads
when
he
was
injured.
in
his
charge,
the
trial
court
admonished
the
jury
that
before
he
can
return
a
verdict
for
the
railroad,
it
would
have
to
find
first,
that
the
petitioner
was
not
working
in
the
course
of
his
employment
by
the
railroad
at
the
time
of
his
injury.
and
second,
the
petitioner
knew
he
was
not
working
for
the
railroad,
but
was
actually
working
for
some
third
party.
by
so
charging
the
jury,
the
trial
court
resolved
all
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
relating
to
the
issue
of
employment
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
so
if
the
trial
court
committed
error,
that
error
was
committed
in
petitioner's
favor.
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
has
had
his
day
in
court
including
a
trial
by
jury
under
proper
instructions
relative
to
the
issue
of
employment.
that
the
only
question
which
the
court
did
not
resolve
and
--
the
trial
court
did
not
resolve
in
the
petitioner's
favor
was
whether
the
parties
had
made
an
agreement
that
the
petitioner
would
work
for
the
railroad
or
an
agreement
that
he
would
work
for
some
third
party.
the
facts
in
this
case
set
it
apart
from
all
previous
cases
decided
by
this
court.
and
in
my
opinion,
conclusively
show
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
no
vital
operational
activity
of
the
railroad
is
here
involved.
i
respectfully
urge
that
the
petitioner's
writ
be
dismissed
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
