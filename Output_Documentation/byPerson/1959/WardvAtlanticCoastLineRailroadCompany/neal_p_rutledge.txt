mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
in
turn
--
which
court
in
turn,
affirmed
a
judgment
for
the
respondent
railroad
in
a
case
arising
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
basic
question
here
presented
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioner,
who
is
the
plaintiff
below,
was
injured
during
the
course
of
his
employment
by
the
railroad.
now,
there
is
no
question
involved
in
the
case,
but
what
the
petitioner
was
a
regular
railroad
employee,
that
that
was
his
occupation.
but
the
cases
of,
we
submit,
they're
more
than
particular
significance
to
the
parties
involved
because
it
involves
a
situation
which
is
applicable
to
the
entire
railroad
industry.
and
to
wit,
it
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
a
worker,
a
regular
railroad
worker,
who
is
engaged
in
repairing
a
sidetrack
that
is
used
by
a
railroad
in
interstate
commerce,
but
is
not
owned
by
the
railroad,
and
which
is
used
by
the
railroad
to
service
more
than
one
customer,
and
which
sidetrack
the
railroad
has
obligated
a
third
party
to
maintain,
not
according
to
any
abstract
or
any
concrete
standards,
but
simply
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
railroad
in
which
third
party
then,
in
turn,
uses
regular
railroad
employees
to
perform
the
work
on
that
track,
whether
or
not,
where
that
situation
is
present,
an
employee
who
is
injured,
under
those
conditions,
is
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
for
the
railroad.
now,
the
facts
that
were
presented
in
this
case
are
very
simple
and
are
essentially
undisputed
except
in
one
area
in
which
there
was
a
very
marked
and
irreconcilable
conflict.
the
facts
are
briefly
that
the
plaintiff,
in
this
case,
was
one
of
a
member
of
a
seven-man
section
crew
of
the
defendant
railroad.
and
that
section
crew
was
composed
of
a
foreman,
of
an
assistant
foreman
and
four
laborers.
the
petitioner
was
the
assistant
foreman
and
the
crew
had
a
section
of
the
railroad's
track
in
which
it
had
responsibility
for
--
for
maintenance
located
primarily
in
levy
county,
florida.
and
the
duties
of
the
crew
included
and
they
were
spelled
out
in
their
--
in
the
railroad's
rulebook
and
they
--
which
was
introduced
into
evidence,
which
was
quoted,
“it
provided
that
this
crew
should
--
the
wording
was
somewhat
ambiguous
but
it
provided
that
the
crew
should
inspect.
the
foreman
should
inspect
and
was
responsible
for
the
proper
safety
of
all
tracks,
trestles,
etcetera
(including
those
privately
owned)
and
so
forth.
now,
the
railroad
contended
that
that
rule
meant
that
they
simply
had
a
duty
to
inspect
the
track.
they
can
have
the
duty
to
maintain
it.
but
in
any
event,
the
evidence
was
--
was
without
dispute
that
the
railroad,
in
this
situation,
applicable
to
a
particular
sidetrack
which
the
railroad
had
constructed
tying
into
its
mainline
road
and
the
track
was
approximately
1500
feet
long.
and
this
track
had
been
built
by
the
railroad
and
the
railroad
had
charged
the
m.&
m.turpentine
company,
a
local
customer,
for
approximately
1350
feet
of
the
track
and
the
railroad,
itself,
owned
and
for
the
expense
of
constructing
150
feet
of
the
track.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
to
--
no.
the
--
the
--
as
i
understand
the
situation,
your
honor,
there
was
mainline
track.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
the
mainline
and
then
the
sidetrack
came
off
it
and
150
feet
of
that
sidetrack
was
owned
by
the
railroad
and
was
maintained
by
the
railroad.
there's
no
question
about
it
was
a
railroad
track.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
it
was
the
end
tying
into
railroad.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
if
it
drew,
it
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
--
it
went
into
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
track
and
the
evidence
was
also
undisputed
that
the
track
was
used
to
service
other
railroad
customers
in
the
area,
particularly
farmers.
this
is
a
--
levy
county
is
a
farming
area
and
huge
quantities
of
watermelon
are
produced
there
and
this
track
was
used
to
service
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
and
also
to
service
these
local
farmers
in
the
area,
shipping
watermelons
out.
and
the
railroad,
by
a
contract
with
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company,
obligated
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
at
its
own
expense,
at
the
turpentine
company's
expense
to
maintain
that
track,
the
portion
that
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
owned
and
the
portion
which
was
being
worked
on
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
chief
railroad
--
chief
engineer
of
the
railroad.
there
were
no
concrete
standards,
no
specifications
or
blueprints
or
anything
of
that
sort.
well,
the
fact
showed
that
in
the
spring
of
1954
as
the
watermelon
season
was
coming
on
and
they
realized
that
there
will
be
a
lot
of
traffic
on
this
sidetrack,
the
foreman
inspected
it.
he
came
on
there
and
he
found
it
defective.
and
so,
he
went
to
the
president
of
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
and
he
told
him
it
was
defective
and
it
would
have
to
be
repaired.
and
the
evidence,
further,
is
undisputed
that
the
owner
--
the
president
of
the
company
who
was
there
at
the
time
of
trial,
told
the
foreman
to
go
ahead
and
fix
it
up
in
such
a
way
that
the
railroad
would
have
no
objection
to
put
his
trains
on
it.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.that's
right.
and
they
fixed
the
--
fixed
the
railroad.
fixed
the
tracks,
so
the
railroad
would
have
no
objection
to
put
its
trains
on
there
and
at
the
company's
expense
and
he
asked
the
foreman
if
he
would
use
his
regular
railroad
section
crew
to
perform
this
work.
that
being
understood
that
he
would
pay
them
their
regular
railroad
rate
of
pay
at
time
and
a
half.
well,
the
evidence
proceeded
from
that
point
to
show
that
the
foreman,
according
to
the
foreman's
version,
which
the
jury
certainly
was
entitled
to
accept
in
this
case
and
chose
to,
that
the
foreman
on
friday
afternoon,
about
quitting
time,
called
his
crew
together
and
told
them
that
there
was
some
extra
work
to
be
done
on
this
track
on
the
mckenzie
siding
was
what
they
referred
to
it.
mckenzie
was
the
president
of
the
turpentine
company.
and
that
if
they
wanted
to
make
some
extra
money,
they
could
engage
in
that
work
and
if
they
didn't
have
to
do
it
that
they
--
they
could
do
it
on
a
voluntary
basis.
and
the
crew
all
agreed
to
perform
the
work
and
in
the
next
morning,
they
met
at
their
regular
time,
at
the
regular
place,
the
railroad
tool
house,
took
their
railroad
tools,
proceeded
out
to
the
siding.
the
evidence
further
was
the
--
by
the
foreman
that
the
owner,
mr.
mckenzie
of
the
turpentine
company,
the
president
of
the
turpentine
company
was
there,
when
they
arrived
there
on
the
scene,
but
then
he
didn't
stay
very
long.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals,
itself,
stated
in
its
statement
of
the
--
of
the
facts,
which
we
don't
--
don't
dispute,
of
course,
that
judge
tuttle
made
a
very
lengthy
statement,
but
he
says
on
page
163
of
the
record,
“mckenzie
was
present
when
the
men
arrived
at
the
job
site,
but
he
left
soon
thereafter
and
the
work
was
carried
out
under
foreman
keen's
direction.”
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
controversy
in
the
evidence
in
the
--
in
the
record
whatsoever,
that
foreman
keen
supervised
and
controlled
and
directed
that
work,
foreman
keen
who
was
section
foreman
for
the
railroad.
and
that
he
prepared
--
he
fixed
that
track
in
a
way
that
he
and
only
he
knew,
would
satisfy
the
railroad.and
as
he
said
when
he
was
asked
whether
or
not
the
turpentine
men
told
him
how
to
do
the
work,
he
said,
“no.”
he
said
that
he
knew
that
i
knew
more
about
it
than
he
did.
so,
we
submit
that
on
--
on
that
state
--
state
of
the
record
that
there
is
no
question
or
no
dispute
of
what
the
manner
of
performing
the
work
was
under
the
control
and
supervision
and
direction
of
the
railroad
foreman.
it
had
to
be
by
a
virtue
of
the
contractual
arrangement
between
the
railroad
and
the
turpentine
company
and
it
was
also
such
in
fact.
during
the
course
of
the
work,
the
plaintiff
was
injured.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
also
for
the
purpose
of
saying
that
in
performing
his
work,
he
was
wearing
the
hat
of
the
railroad.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
no.
it's
certainly
is
not
so
agreed
and
i
couldn't
say
that
it
was.
i'm
sure
mr.
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
certainly.
thereafter,
the
plaintiff
was
injured
during
the
course
of
this
work
and
later
brought
this
suit
and,
of
course,
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
or
not,
he
was
injured
during
the
course
of
his
employment.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
plaintiff,
petitioner,
made
two
alternative
requests
for
instruction.
first
request
was
that
the
--
taking
first
the
request
that
he
made
was
to
the
effect
that
the
court
should
charge
the
jury
as
a
matter
of
law,
under
these
undisputed
facts.
that
the
petitioner
was
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
for
the
railroad
and
the
second
series
of
request
were
charged,
primarily
request
number
two,
was
to
the
effect
that
if
the
court
denied
that
peremptory
request,
that
the
court
should
then
charge
the
jury
concerning
the
usual
criteria
governing
whether
a
man
is
working
for
one
employer
or
another
to
wit,
the
criteria
which
this
court
recently
referred
to
in
the
baker
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
has
been
set
forth
by
the
--
in
the
restatement.
and
the
--
of
course,
the
primary
criteria
that
is
referred
there,
is
that
the
criteria
of
controlling
or
supervising
or
directing
the
manner
of
the
work
and
the
power
to
control
it.
the
court
denied
both
of
these
requests
and
instead,
submitted
the
case
entirely
to
the
jury
on
the
sole
question
of
whether
or
not,
it
had,
in
fact,
been
told
to
the
plaintiff
before
he
went
to
work,
which
the
plaintiff
denied.
that
if
he
went
to
work
on
that
track,
he
would
not
be
working
for
the
railroad,
but
would
be
working
for
the
turpentine
company
and
the
court
deciding
that
if
the
plaintiff
was
so
told
that
he
would
not
be
working
for
the
railroad,
then
he
would
--
not
working
for
the
railroad
when
he
was
injured.
on
the
other
hand,
that
if
he
was
merely
directed
in
order
to
go
out
there
without
having
the
situation
explained
to
him,
why
then
he
would
be
working
for
the
railroad?
now,
the
jury
returned
on
the
basis
of
that
instruction,
returned
a
verdict
for
the
defendant
railroad.
turning
first
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
an
employee
of
the
railroad
when
he
was
injured,
under
the
undisputed
facts,
our
argument
is
primarily
three-pronged.
first,
we
contend
and
if
cited
at
series
of
decisions
primarily
in
the
lower
court,
holding
that
in
lower
federal
courts,
construing
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
holding
that
the
--
where
it
appears
conclusively,
that
the
railroad
has
control
of
the
work
that
in
that
situation
even
where
an
independent
contractor
or
one
who
is
been
labeled
an
independent
contractor
is
hired
to
do
the
work.
but
nevertheless,
the
railroad
will
be
deemed
the
employer
and
the
particular
case,
the
landmark
case,
in
that
regard,
is
the
cimorelli
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
where
the
railroad
hired
an
independent
contractor
to
perform
certain
loading
operations.
and
it
--
the
contract
that
the
railroad
made
with
the
contractor
expressly
provided
that
the
contractor
would
be
an
independent
contractor.
and
the
contract
further
provided
however,
that
the
work
should
be
done
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
railroad,
which
is
the
same
situation
we
have
here.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
as
--
that
the
--
that
an
employee
of
the
independent
contractor,
so-called,
was
actually
under
the
control
of
the
railroad
at
the
time
that
he
was
injured,
because
the
railroad
was
controlling
the
manner
of
the
work
being
done.
and
then
accordingly,
he
was
entitled
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
bring
suit
for
injuries
received
during
the
course
of
such
employment.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
right.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
exactly,
your
honor,
precisely.
we'd
--
we
so
phrased
our
--
our
request
for
instruction
in
the
alternative
and
we've
--
we've
taken
before
the
court
that
way.
he
denied
both
sets
of
request.
and
the
court
of
appeals
took
up
and
discussed
and
considered
at
length,
both
propositions.
we
--
we
submit
that
this
element
of
--
of
control
here,
particularly
the
power
to
control,
appears
conclusively
from
the
fact
that
the
contractual
arrangement
between
the
railroad
and
the
turpentine
company,
concerning
this
track,
was
that
the
work
be
done
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
chief
engineer
of
the
railroad
and
the
only
way
that
work
could
be
done,
would
be
under
the
control
of
the
railroad,
where
the
contract
is
made
with
that
type
of
vague
language,
because
nobody
could
know
exactly
what
would
or
what
would
not
happen
to
satisfy
the
railroad's
chief
engineer.
in
short,
we
say
that
where
--
where
there
is
a
sidetrack
which
is
used
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
railroad,
in
this
case,
stipulated
in
the
trial
court,
this
sidetrack,
this
particular
sidetrack
was
used
in
interstate
commerce.
that
where
you
have
a
sidetrack
that
is
used
in
interstate
commerce
by
a
railroad
to
service
not
just
one
customer,
but
several
customers
in
the
area
and
where
that
--
where
the
railroad
obligates
a
third
person
to
maintain
that
track
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
railroad's
chief
engineer
by
a
contractor
and
where
the
contractor,
then
in
turn,
hires
regular
railroad
section
crew
to
perform
the
work
on
that
track.
and
where
that
work
is
done
with
regular
railroad
tools
at
regular
railroad
rates
of
pay,
under
the
supervision
of
the
regular
railroad
foreman
that
is
a
matter
of
law,
a
person
in
that
situation
is
an
employee
of
the
railroad
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
law.
turning
next
to
the
second
basis
for
that
contention,
we
relied
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
case
had
not
come
down
at
the
time
of
trial
on
the
sinkler
decision.
holding
that
even
if
there
was
a
factual
dispute
here
as
to
the
amount
of
control,
or
even
if
under
common
law
standards,
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
here,
could
not
be
deemed
an
agent
of
the
railroad.
that
nevertheless,
under
the
sinkler
decision
of
this
court,
under
the
trust
of
the
sinkler
decision,
that
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company,
in
this
type
of
situation,
should
be
deemed
an
agent
of
the
railroad.
and
that
accordingly,
where
he'd
use
regular
railroad
employees
to
do
the
work,
those
employees
did
not
lose
their
status
as
such.
in
other
words,
those
employees
would
then
either
be
working
for
the
railroad
and
consequently
covered
by
the
federal
employers'
liability
or
working
for
an
agent
of
the
railroad
and
consequently
be
covered.
we
submit
that
that's
the
case
because
here,
this
was
regular,
ordinary
maintenance
work.
it
wasn't
new
construction.
it
was
not
extraordinary
repairs
of
a
major
type,
which
one
would
be
expected
perhaps
to
use
an
independent
contractor
on.
it
was
a
regular
recurring
maintenance
work
on
a
track
which
the
railroad
used
in
interstate
commerce.
and
at
such
regular
recurring
maintenance
work,
is
an
operational
function
of
the
railroad.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
i
submit,
it
does.
there
were
repeated
references
to
the
fact
that
this
was
an
established
practice,
that
this
--
this
crew
regularly
worked
on
saturday
for
the
various
--
working
on
these
various
private
siting.
and
that
they
had
worked
before
on
this
particular
siting,
under
this
type
of
arrangement.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
not
in
the
former
instances,
your
honor.
except,
i
believe,
it
was
undisputed
that
in
each
case,
the
turpentine
company
as
it
was
obligated
to
do
by
its
contract
with
the
railroad
had
paid
the
workers.
what
it
had
done
was
a
--
would
issue
a
check
to
the
foreman
for
the
total
amount
of
the
wages.
the
foreman
would
take
the
check
and
cash
it
and
pay
the
crew
off
in
cash.
now,
of
course,
when
they
worked
for
the
--
for
the
railroad
in
the
sense
that
on
their
regular
work
during
the
week,
they
got
paid
by
a
railroad
check,
there
is
that
difference
in
the
--
in
the
way
that
the
men
were
paid.
and
there's
no
question
that
the
economic
burden
here
was
on
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company.
now,
when
the
track
was
constructed,
it
was
constructed
by
the
railroad.
and
then,
the
railroad
built
the
turpentine
company
for
the
cost
of
it.
not
here,
its
main
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
exactly.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
right.
actually,
the
record
shows
that
the
property
itself
was
owned
by
mr.
mckenzie.
and
that
the
turpentine
company,
of
which
he
was
president,
was
also
substantially
his
company,
but
the
contract
was
between
the
railroad
and
the
turpentine
company.
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner,
stated
that
he
didn't
know
who
owned
the
track.
in
any
event,
we
--
we
submit
that
under
one
by
virtue
of
the
fact
to
control
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
was
an
employee.
and
secondly,
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
sinkler
case,
the
--
regardless
of
whether
there
was
enough
control
to
make
it
a
question
of
law
that
under
the
sinkler
decision,
the
turpentine
company
should
be
deemed
the
agent
of
the
railroad
and
that
accordingly,
this
man
as
a
matter
of
law,
was
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
finally,
our
second
point
is
that
moving
on,
even
though
--
even
though
the
court
rejected
our
contention
that
the
man,
as
a
matter
of
law,
was
an
employee
of
the
railroad.
that
the
court
still
erred,
still
committed
further
error.
and
that
the
court
submitted
the
question
for
whom
the
man
was
working
to
the
jury
solely
on
the
question
of
what
was
told
him
and
refused
to
charge
the
jury
on
the
other
criteria
which
the
reinstatement
states
in
the
baker
case
to
wit,
control
a
form
of
payment,
rate
of
pay,
tools
and
all
the
other
criteria
which
governed
the
usual
familiar
problem,
which
arises
whenever
there
is
an
ambiguous
situation
about
for
whom
a
man
is
working.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
our
request
is
contained
in
the
record,
particularly
request
number
two.
and
the
court
stated
that
--
stated
it
had
no
disagreement
with
the
law
expressed
in
the
request,
but
that
he
thought
it
would
be
confusing
to
the
jury
and
that
he'd
rather
give
his
own
charge.
and
he
submitted
that
--
he
submitted
it
to
the
jury
entirely
on
the
basis
of
what
had
in
fact
been
told
to
this
employee.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
certainly,
it's
had
--
now,
we
certainly
contended
in
the
court
below,
very
strongly,
that
if
the
point,
that
if
as
the
petitioner
testified,
had
happened.
that
the
foreman
had
simply
on
friday
told
him,
“we've
got
some
extra
work
to
do.you'll
be
paid
overtime.report
to
work
out
there
at
the
siting.”
that
clearly,
he
was
working
for
the
railroad,
at
that
time,
because
the
railroad
couldn't
order
him
to
do
the
work
and
then
denied
that
it
was
employing
him.
but
we
--
we
also
vigorously
argue
that
the
converse
did
not
apply.
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
told
him
that
he
was
working
for
the
m.
&
m.
turpentine
company
didn't
actually
and
completely
control
the
situation.
we
submit,
you
could
tell
a
man
that
he's
working
for
your
agent
and
he's
still,
as
a
matter
of
law,
would
be
working
for
the
railroad.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
the
language
in
the
footnote,
your
honor?
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
i
--
i
think
so,
yes,
your
honor.
that
the
railroad
was
liable
unless
the
defendant's
foreman
made
it
clear
to
him
before
he
started
to
work
that
morning
that
they
were
not
working
for
the
railroad,
but
working
on
a
private
track
to
make
some
extra
money.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
i
certainly
--
i
--
i
think
what
the
court
was
--
was
getting
at
was
what
the
petitioner
himself
understood
at
the
time.
i
suppose
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes,
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
--
i
think,
this
is
not
the
complete
charge
on
the
employment
issue
and
the
reason
that
i
stood
up
at
that
point,
which
is
at
the
conclusion
of
the
charge
and
the
objective
was
because,
it
seemed
to
me,
that
the
judge
was
telling
them
that
if
he
understood
that
he
was
working
on
a
private
track,
why
then,
he
wasn't
working
for
the
railroad?
and
i
didn't
think
that
to
be
an
accurate
statement,
because
i
didn't
think
it
matters
whether
he
understood
his
--
who
owned
the
track.
thank
you.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
i
--
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
