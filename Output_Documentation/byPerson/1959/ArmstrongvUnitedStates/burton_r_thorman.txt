mr.
burton
r.
thorman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
action
in
the
court
of
claims
was
brought
by
the
27
petitioners,
all
of
whom
were
suppliers
and
materialmen
to
a
government
contractor,
the
rice
shipbuilding
corporation,
to
recover
just
compensation.
in
the
court
below,
it
was
alleged
that
their
property
rights,
that
is
the
right
to
enforce
their
liens
against
the
contractor's
property,
were
taken
from
them
when,
after
the
government
terminated
the
contract
for
default,
it
required
the
contractor
to
transfer
title
to
partially
completed
boats
and
materials
therefore
to
the
government.
now,
the
court
of
claims
found
for
the
government,
on
the
grounds
that
at
the
time
the
petitioners
claim
to
have
acquired
liens,
the
government
actually
had
what
it
termed
“inchoate
title”
to
the
materials
which
made
the
boats
a
public
work
to
which
liens
could
not
attach.
the
petitioners
then
sought
review
in
this
court.
now,
the
facts
relating
to
the
contract
of
the
rice
shipbuilding
corporation
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
we
have
the
same
[laughs]
difficulty,
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
perhaps,
as
i
go
into
the
facts,
this
will
clarify
itself
what
the
court
meant.
the
facts
relating
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no,
the
liens
were
as
perfected
as
they
could
be
and
i
might
respectfully
submit,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
the
statute,
and
this
was
a
main
statute
with
which
we're
concerned,
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
it's
section
13
chapter
178
revised
statutes
of
maine
and
it
provides
that
liens
--
whoever
furnishes
labor
and
materials
for
building
a
vessel
has
a
lien
which
may
be
enforced
by
--
may
be
enforced
by
attachment
within
four
days
after
the
vessel
is
launched,
and
they
also
have
a
lien
on
the
materials
furnished
before
they
become
part
of
the
vessel.
the
full
text
is
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no.
and
it
goes
on
in
the
second
full
sentence.
it
says
that
he
also
has
a
lien
on
the
materials
furnished
before
they
become
part
of
the
vessel
which
may
be
enforced
by
attachment.
as
--
i
think
the
statute
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
a
lien
which
arises
by
virtue
of
the
work
and
materials
which
is
being
done
on
these
vessels,
and
it's
to
protect
him
up
until
the
time
that
the
vessel
is
launched
and
for
four
days
thereafter,
and
his
remedy
is
to
attach
the
vessel
or
to
attach
the
material
in
the
event
that
the
vessel
is
never
completed.
to
go
into
the
facts
of
the
contract
in
march
of
1954,
rice
--
rice
shipbuilding
corporation
which,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i'll
refer
to
as
rice
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no,
your
honor.
the
case
came
up
to
the
--
came
before
the
court
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
because
the
facts
were
pretty
much
established.
and
the
court,
for
the
purpose
of
their
--
of
their
decision,
assumed
that
there
would
have
been
liens,
i
think
this
is
a
fair
characterization
of
the
court's
opinion,
but
they
said
that
the
liens
could
not
attach
because
of
what
they
call
the
government's
inchoate
title
which
ran
from
the
--
apparently
from
the
beginning
of
the
making
of
the
contract.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no,
they
--
they
didn't
get
into
that
question
because
they
stopped
at
this
threshold
question
of
there
not
being
any
liens.
now,
as
i
said,
the
contract
started
in
1954.
by
august
2nd,
1955,
rice
was
unable
to
complete
the
contract
and
so,
the
contract
was
terminated
then
for
default.
at
the
same
time
that
the
government
sent
a
termination
letter,
they
requested
rice
to
transfer
title
to
the
uncompleted
votes
and
to
the
materials
which
rice
had
in
hand
to
the
government.
and
on
august
4th,
1955,
rice
executed
an
instrument
of
transfer
of
title
transferring
to
the
government
all
right
title
and
interest
to
the
manufacturing
materials
designated
by
the
government.
this
followed,
by
two
days,
the
actual
letter
of
termination.
now,
i
think
i
may
have
neglected
to
mention
that
the
boats
under
rice's
contract
were
to
be
built
in
the
state
of
maine,
east
boothbay
to
be
exact.
there
were
11
personnel
boats
involved.
following
the
termination
and
the
execution
of
this
transfer
of
title,
rice
--
the
government
took
title
and
possession
to
the
materials
and
took
them
out
of
the
state
of
maine
to
various
navy
yards
where
they
completed
the
boats.
now,
rice
was,
shortly
after
that,
adjudicated
a
bankrupt
and
the
government
filed
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
court
for
its
alleged
cross
of
completion.
now,
in
acquiring
title,
the
government
acted
in
accordance
with
section
11
(d)
of
the
contract.
section
11
is
the
default
clause
and
the
section
(d)
is
set
forth
at
page
42
of
the
record.
this
clause
provided
that,
in
the
event
of
a
default
termination,
the
government
had
an
option
to
acquire
title
to
any
completed
supplies
and
any
uncompleted
supplies
which
they
designated
as
manufacturing
materials.
it
also
provided
further
on
that
the
government
would
pay
to
the
contractor
either
the
contract
price
for
completed
supplies
or
the
--
an
agreed
price
for
uncompleted
supplies.
now,
the
contract
with
rice
also
had
a
progress
payments
clause,
under
which
rice
had
received
the
aggregate
of
about
$141,000.
this
was
based
upon
a
percentage
of
completion
less
a
3%
reserve.
the
progress
payment
clause
provided
that
rice
was
to--
that
the
government
rather,
was
to
have
a
lien
on
all
work
in
progress
and
that
this
was
to
be
a
paramount
lien.
now,
as
of
april
11th,
1955,
when
rice
submitted
its
last
progress
payment
voucher
or
invoice,
rice
had
incurred
actual
incurred
cost
of
$198,000.
subsequent
to
that,
apparently,
there
was
not
sufficient
amount
of
work
done
to
warrant
rice
putting
in
any
further
bills
and
ultimately,
on
august
2,
1955
when
the
government
terminated
the
contract,
they
did
note
that
rice
had
done
no
work
or
claim
that
rice
had
done
no
work
since
march
25th,
1955.
now,
the
lien
which
the
government
acquired
by
virtue
of
this
progress
payment
clause
was
not
exercised
by
the
government,
since
the
government
elected
to
take
title
under
its
option
given
to
it
under
the
default
clause.
now,
the
petitioners
had
furnished
supplies,
materials,
and
equipment
to
rice
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
for
use
on
the
boats.
yes
sir.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
i
think
that
the
--
the
effect
--
the
government
--
the
government
didn't
say
anything
about
its
lien
when
they
went
after
the
title.they
simply
said
to
rice,
“you
transfer
title
to
us.”
now,
i
think
the
legal
effect
was
to
merge
the
government's
lien
in
its
title
since,
obviously,
i
think
it's
clear
by
law
that
one
cannot
have
a
subordinate
interest
in
the
same
piece
of
property
in
which
he
has
a
dominant
interest.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
difficulty
we
have
had
with
the
concept
to
the
court
of
claims
is
that,
apparently,
the
court
felt
that
with
the
making
of
the
contract,
the
government
then
acquired
its
inchoate
title.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
and
i
think
that,
if
they
are
correct
in
this
concept,
then
we
come
to
a
second
question
of
what
does
an
inchoate
lien
mean.
does
it
bar
the
acquisition
of
a
lien?
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
i
mean
inchoate
title.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
does
it
bar
the
--
does
it
bar
the
acquisition
of
liens
on
the
property?
one
of
the
reasons
we
asked
the
court
to
review
this
case
was
the
fact
that
it
opened
up
such
a
pandora's
box
of
problems.
the
default
clause
in
which
the
government
relied
on
in
taking
title
here
is
a
standard
clause
in
most
government
contract,
certainly
throughout
the
military
department.
and
if
the
court
below
is
right,
if
this
inchoate
title
which
they
did
not
define
means
that
it's
a
synonym
for
title,
then
there
are
a
host
of
problems,
as
anybody
who
deals
with
the
government.
there's
a
host
of
problems
in
line
of
the
detroit
against
murray
corporation
type
of
situation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
states
and
localities
may
tax
this
property
in
the
possession
of
this
people.
we
think
that
it
was
unfortunate
that
the
court
below
used
this
shorthand
title
without
shorthand
expression
of
inchoate
title
without
defining
it
further
but
we
think
that
if
the
court
is
disposed
to
follow
it,
perhaps
it
could
define
it,
and
i
don't
think
it
can
possibly
mean
that
it
would
bar
all
liens,
including
taxes
and
taxes
from
attaching
to
it.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
excuse
me.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
so
far
as
we
know,
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
and
so
far
as
the
information
is
available
to
me
as
counsel,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
government
did
anything
but
to
demand
that
title
be
transferred
to
it.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
well,
i
think
that
that
is
--
that
is
one
of
the
points
which
we
raise,
although
that
is
not
a
primary
point.
i
think
that
the
difference
between
198,000
which--
$198,000
which
rice
had
put
into
this
contract
and
$141,000
which
they
had
received
from
the
government
did
leave
an
equity
in
rice
for
$57,000.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
agreed,
but
i
still
think
that
the
fact
that
there
was
this
large
expenditure
indicated
that
the
property
might
have
brought.
if
foreclosure
had
--
had
followed,
the
property
might
have
brought
a
sum
in
excess
of
what
the
government
had
invested
in
it,
so
that
there
would
have
been
some
sum.
our
--
our
primary
point,
though,
is
that
the
government
did
none
of
these
things.
they
just
took
the
--
took
the
property,
took
the
title
for
the
property,
foreclosing
us
from,
perhaps
the
word
“foreclosing”
is
still
advised
here
but,
preventing
us
from
taking
any
steps
to
enforce
our
liens.
in
other
words,
we
had
a
security
interest
in
our
liens
in
this
property.
when
the
government
took
the
property,
took
title
to
the
property,
we
were
estopped
from
ever
doing
anything
more
about
it.
the
government
could
have
protected
its
own
interest
in
this
by
foreclose
--
starting
foreclosure
proceedings
under
its
paramount
lien.
in
which
case,
if
there
were
some
left
over
for
us,
fine.
if
there
were
not,
then
that
would
have
forever
wiped
it
out.
but,
we
would
have
had
our
remedy.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no.
we
--
we're
claiming
that
--
we're
claiming
just
compensation
for
the
taking
of
our
liens.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
of
our
liens.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
well,
the
liens
had
a
value
at
all.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no.
our
--
the
--
the
value
of
our
liens
is
determined
by
the
amount
of
money
which
we
put
into
the
property.
we
put
in
some
$23,000.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
the
amount
of
our
lien.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
well,
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
just
compensation
though,
as
i
read
the
cases,
we're
concerned
with
the
value
to
the
person
who
lost
the
property
rather
than
any
gain
which
the
government
may
have
acquired
in
this.
that
is
why
i
said
before
that
this
is
a
secondary
point
when
i
speak
of
this
equity.
it's
a
matter
of
interest
that
there
was
this
equity
involved
in
the
property.
at
first,
the
point
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
state
of
the
title
to
the
materials
and
uncompleted
boats
prior
to
the
transfer
of
title
to
the
government,
since
the
decision
below
did
go
off
on
this
point
of
the
inchoate
title.
first,
by
the
contract
terms,
the
title
to
the
property
was
in
rice
during
the
performance
of
the
contract.
first,
on
the
face
page
of
the
contract,
we
find
that
title
to
the
--
which
appears
at
page
27
of
the
record,
that
the
point
of
acceptance
is
at
point
of
delivery
and
that
delivery
points
are
spelled
out
as
various
navy
yards,
philadelphia
and
norfolk.
further,
the
contract
contained
a
discharge
of
liens
clause
which
provided,
and
incidentally,
that
is
at
page
37
of
the
record,
which
provided
that
the
contractor
would
immediately
discharge
or
cause
to
be
discharged
any
lien
or
right
in
rem
of
any
kind
other
than
favor
of
the
government
against
the
property
and
that,
failing
in
that
duty,
the
government
reserved
the
right
to
discharge
these
liens
at
his
expense,
at
the
contractor's
expense.
thirdly,
we
have
this
paramount
lien
clause
and
these
two
clauses,
these
discharges
of
liens
clause
and
the
paramount
lien
clause,
when
read
together,
clearly
contemplate
that
the
government
did
not
anticipate
that
it
would
have
title.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
the
paramount
of
the
lien
clause,
mr.
justice
clark,
is
set
forth
at
page
36
and
the
opening
is
at
top
of
page
36,
the
first
--
very
first
clause.
it's
a
portion
of
a
clause
which
starts
on
page
35,
which
is
denominatedly
progress,
payments,
and
liens
clause.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
then,
we
have
this
default
clause
which
states
that,
on
condition
of
default
of
the
contract,
the
government
acquired
an
option
to
require
the
contractor
to
transfer
it
--
transfer
to
the
government
the
title
with
the
further
provision
in
this
option
that
the
government
would
have
to
pay
for
the
materials
it
had
taken.
now,
i
think
the
court
of
claims
missed
the
point
that
the
default
clause
was
a
condition
which
only
arose
or
that
it
was
an
option
which
only
arose
on
condition
that
the
contract
--
contractor
was
in
default
and
that
the
government
then
exercised
its
option
to
terminate,
and
only
at
that
point
did
the
option
arise.
now,
based
upon
these
considerations,
i
submit,
the
contract
clearly
contemplated
that
rice
would
have
title
at
all
times
to
the
materials
until
delivery
and
acceptance
of
the
boats
or
until
the
government
exercised
its
option
after
the
default.
aside
from
the
terms
of
the
contract,
the
fact
that
the
government
required
the
execution
of
an
instrument
of
transfer
of
title,
we
--
we
think,
is
significant
of
the
government's
intention,
that
is,
of
the
intention
of
the
parties.
and
i
might
note
to
the
court
that
the
instrument
of
transfer
of
title
appears
at
page
50
of
the
record.
well,
it
starts
on
page
49.
so
that,
clearly,
the
government,
in
asking
that
the
transfer
of
title
be
executed,
recognized
that
it
would
not
then
have
title.
the
court
below
also
stated
that,
because
of
this
inchoate
title,
it
considered
the
work
in
the
nature
of
the
public
work.
the
cases
we've
read
and
have
cited
in
our
brief
indicate
that
the
public
work
concept,
as
the
term
“public
work,”
applies
only
to
government
property
and
the
cases
are
very
clear
on
this
concept,
on
this
principle.
the
work
is
private
if
the
title
remains
in
the
contractor
and
it's
public
if
the
title
is
in
the
government.
now,
while
rice
had
its
--
had
the
title
to
the
materials
and
the
uncompleted
boats,
the
p-petitioners
supplied
their
material
--
supplied
materials
and
work
to
rice.
and
at
that
time,
they
acquired
their
liens
on
the
property.
that
is
on
the
materials
and
uncompleted
boats.
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
petitioners
must
have
acquired
their
liens
prior
to
the
time
that
the
government
acquired
its
paramount
lien
although
we
don't
argue
with
the
point
that
it
is
paramount
because
obviously,
the
work
had
to
be
done
and
the
material
supplied
before
there
can
be
a
state
of
completion
which
would
warrant
the
government
issuing
any
progress
payment.
now,
we
say
that
rice
could
transfer
nothing
more
than
it
had
and
in
the
words
of
the
instrument,
it
transferred
all
its
right,
title,
and
interest
into
the
said
manufacturing
materials.
now,
i
think
that
one
word
i've
--
one
or
two
words
about
the
fact
that
the
liens
were
still
encumbrances
on
the
property
while
the
--
when
the
government
acquired
it.
the
main
statute
is
one
of
a
class
of
statutes
which,
i
suppose,
could
be
broadly
characterized
as
mechanics
lien
statutes.
they're
made
in
recognition
of
the
entitlement
to
payment
of
the
people
who,
by
supplying
work
and
materials,
created
such
value.
in
a
sense,
the
statues
are
designed
to
prevent
unjust
enrichment
at
the
expense
of
the
suppliers
and
workers.
now,
when
the
government
terminated
the
contract
for
default,
since
the
title
was
in
rice,
they
had
two
options.
first,
they
could
enforce
their
own
lien
--
enforce
its
own
lien
and
secondly,
to
exercise
the
option
under
the
--
under
the
default
clause
to
acquire
title.
as
i
said
before,
when
they
terminated
the
contract,
the
contracting
officer
took
the
position
in
its
termination
letter
that
rice
had
done
no
work
after
march
25,
1955,
so
that
there
was
a
chance,
any
good
chance,
that
there
are
unpaid
suppliers.
the
government
knew
that
rice
had
not
done
any
work
from
march
until
august
because
rice
had
ran
out
of
money.
the
government
then
had
its
option
to
decide
which
was
the
most
favorable
course
of
action
to
it.
in
any
event,
the
government
did
go
ahead
and
exercised
its
option
to
acquire
title
rather
than
doing
anything
more
about
its
liens.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
the
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
that
the
lien
rights
had
some
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
--
value?
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
to
show
that
there
was
a
cumulative
amount
in
excess
of
that,
although,
i
think
the
record
does
show
that
that
was
the
fact
that
there
was,
on
the
face
of
it,
an
expenditure
of
money
in
excess
of
what
the
government
had
paid,
substantially
in
excess
of
what
they
had
paid.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
that's
correct.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
these
were
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
which
assumed
that
the
record
was
correct.
the
--
it
assumed
that
the
--
that
we
did
have
liens,
i
think,
for
the
purpose
of
the
motion.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
that
they
were
of
some
value,
value
of
$23,000
which
is
set
forth,
well,
in
the
record
at
page
14,
15,
16
and
17.
we
set
forth
the
individual
amounts
which
had
been
--
that
is
the
amount
of
the
materials
and
services
which
had
been
advanced
by
these
petitioners
to
the
contractors
and
how
much
they
had
still
not
been
paid.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
we
would
--
we
--
we
--
i
recall
now.
we
did
reserve
the
right
that
if
we
--
we
move
for
summary
judgment
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
with
--
as
to
everything
except
the
amount.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
that
would
be
a
matter
of
proof.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
in
my
previous
argument,
i
think
i
may
have
overlooked
mentioning
that,
at
page
35
of
the
record,
which
is
the
progress,
payments,
and
liens
clause,
it
is
provided
that
the
government
will
only
pay
97%
of
the
total
contract
price
based
upon
the
progress
of
completion
as
certified
by
a
naval
inspector.
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
government
retained
3%
of
the
money
which
the
contractor
had
earned
based
upon
a
percentage
of
completion.
and,
this
bond,
of
course,
would
have
been
available
for
the
payment
of
the
liens
of
these
people,
although,
admittedly,
in
this
case,
that
3%
was
not
enough
to
pay
the
$23,000
which
are
here
an
issue.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
the
measure
is
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
the
--
if
i
may,
the
amount
is
$23,000.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no,
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no,
we're
not
--
we're
not
attacking
the
--
the
government's
lien.
we
say
that
the
government,
by
virtue
of
its
sovereign
capacity,
has
destroyed
our
liens.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
and
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no,
it
is
our
position
that
the
government
didn't
exercise
its
lien.
they
took
the
title
and
they
were
obligated
at
that
point
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
well,
we
--
we
think
that
it
is
our
loss
and
not
whatever
the
government
may
have
gained.
i
mean,
at
least
i
think
it's
clear
what
has
happened.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
--
our
area
of
the
gain
is
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
that
is
--
that
is
correct
under
just
compensation
because
we
have
a
right
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
well,
we
had
a
right
to
have
the
property
subjected
to
the
liens
which
were
enforced
against
the
property.
admittedly,
the
government
has
a
lien
and
we
have
a
lien.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no.
we
--
we
concede
that
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
no,
because
the
government
--
the
government
did
nothing
to
enforce
its
lien.
if
the
government
had
taken
its
part
--
taken
its
lien
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
well,
we
--
the
contractor
put
$198,000
into
the
contract
and
this
was
submitted
to
the
government
despite
some
obscurity
on
the
issue.
this
was
--
this
figure
was
submitted
to
the
government
and
appears
at
page
58
of
the
record.
it
was
part
of
the
submission
to
the
--
part
of
the
submission
to
the
government
in
connection
with
the
progress
payment,
the
last
progress
payment
that
was
requested
from
the
government.
now,
i
think
that
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
they
did
--
they
did
pay
that
much
amount
of
money.
that
rice
spent
$198,000.
this
was
40
or
--
$57,000
more
than
the
government
had
paid
and
the
reason
this
came
about
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
--
was
--
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
i
--
i
think
we
could
because
the
government
has
--
has
taken
and
chosen
this
method.
it
must
be
remembered,
the
government
had
two
options.
they
could
foreclose
on
this
lien.
they
had
--
they
had
the
choice
of
--
of
what
they're
going
to
do,
or
they
could
take
their
title,
acquired
title
subject
to
this
section
11
(d)
of
the
contract.
they
chose
11
(d).
now,
why
they
chose
it?
we
don't
know.
we
can
only
speculate.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
well,
i
think
we
had
a
right
to
go
through
a
foreclosure
proceeding
which
would
then
have
subjected
this
whole
subject
of
value
to
the
light
of
day.
now,
i'm
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
government,
i
don't
know
whether
counsel
has
mentioned
in
his
argument,
claims
to
have
spent
considerably
more
money
to
complete
the
contract.
but
this
all
arose
much
later
and
we're
based
--
we're
stuck
with
the
government's
alleged
cost
because
rice
was
in
bankruptcy
and
never
contested
this
amount.
but
i
think
that
we
had
a
right
to
have
this
subjected
to
the
light
of
day
to
the
foreclosure
proceedings.
mr.
burton
r.
thorman
yes,
i
--
i
would
agree.
