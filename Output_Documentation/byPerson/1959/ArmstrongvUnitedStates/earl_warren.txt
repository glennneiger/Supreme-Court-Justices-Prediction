versus
united
states.
mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thorman,
if
we
--
if
we
accept
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims,
would
there
be
any
time
at
which
these
petitioners
could
have
acquired
a
lien?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
an
inchoate
title,
you
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
--
mr.
slade.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
slade,
if
the
--
if
the
concept
of
the
court
of
claims
is
correct
that
the
government
had
an
inchoate
title,
whatever
that
might
be,
and
that,
therefore,
these
were
public
works
that,
therefore,
the
liens
didn't
attach,
was
there
any
--
any
way
in
which
these
--
these
people
could
have
perfect
their
liens?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
about
when
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
said
it
was
public
works
and
that
it
didn't
attach
what
was
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
he
saying
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
do
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
very
beginning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
let
me
ask
you
this.
was
there
any
time
--
was
there
any
time
after
these
people
performed
these
services
that
they
--
they
could
have
had
an
enforceable
lien
against
this
ship.
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
slade,
may
i
pursue
just
a
little
further,
not
to
be
argumentative
with
it
but
i
haven't
got
it
clear
in
my
--
my
mind
yet.
was
there
any
time
at
which
these
petitioners
could
have
enforced
their
liens
against
this
whole?
and
if
there
was,
what
could
they
have
done
and
up
to
what
date
could
they
have
done
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
could
have
done
that
at
any
time
prior
to
the
time
the
government
did
take
it
over.
chief
justice
earl
warren
title.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
slade.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon
me,
you
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
slade,
is
--
is
that
answer
of
yours
consistent
with
the
--
the
theory
of
the
court
of
claims
that
--
that
this
a
public
works
and
that,
therefore,
no
lien
can
attach?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
the
situation
had
been
as
justice
black
outlined
a
situation
that
the
court
of
claims,
under
its
theory
in
this
case,
would
have
decided
differently?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
the
government
had
put
$100,000
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
into
it
and
that
there
had
been
$150,000
put
in
it
by
the
work
and
materials,
that
--
that
there
would
be
a
lien?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
that
in
--
in
response
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
these
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
are
not
the
contractor.
these
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
these
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
thought
that
would
be
a
help
to
the
little
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
thorman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
