justice

certainly
--
you
say
firm.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
hear
the
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
have
to
analyze
this
a
little
bit
beyond
your
own
analysis?
what's
the
source
of
this
lien?
who
--
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
of
maine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
real
question
is,
isn't
it,
whether
the
state
of
maine
can
create
an
interest
and
complete
property
having
money
value
as
against
the
united
states
dealings
with
its
lienee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
--
isn't
that
really
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
state
of
maine
can
create
a
protectable
interest
as
against
the
united
states,
then
whatever
happens
to
that
lien
is
no
concern
of
the
united
states.
so,
that's
the
issue
really,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
the
time
that
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
that
the
government
made
this
contract
with
rice,
there
wasn't
anything
in
existence
that
the
government
supplanted
that
the
present
petitioner
had,
was
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
--
the
subsequent
thereto,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
whatever
private
arrangements
you
may
have
had
with
rice
or
whatever
the
state
of
maine
may
have
announced
to
all
the
world
giving,
therefore,
notice
to
the
united
states,
is
immaterial
as
to
the
legal
consequences
of
the
transaction
between
the
united
states
and
rice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
there
was
a
destruction
of
something
that
has
money
value
in
maine
doesn't
mean
uncle
sam
has
gone
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
slade,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
if
armstrong
had
followed,
what
i
understand
you
to
be,
maine
law
to
perfect
this
lien
am
i
using
the
correct
language?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
make
it
something
that
has
to
be
respected
under
all
points
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
enforce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
armstrong
had
taken
the
--
the
steps
necessary
under
maine
law
to
enforce
his
lien,
could
he
have
taken
those
steps
without
bringing
the
united
states
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
he
had
not
brought
them
in,
under
maine
law,
and
if
it
weren't
united
states
but
anybody
else,
what
would
be
the
consequence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
--
what
would
--
what
would
the
united
states
be
doing
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
had
not
--
if
they
had
not
done
anything
but
--
but
acquiesced
to
what
the
sheriff
--
the
physical
act
of
the
sheriff,
you
would
have
a
different
situation,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
things
have
happened
that
are
unconceivable
in
this
world.
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
when
you
replied
to
justice
black
a
little
while
ago,
he
abandoned
or
what
was
the
word?
he
(inaudible)
he
abandoned
his
lien.
didn't
you
--
he
had
a
lien
and
lost
it.
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
an
accurate
way
of
putting
it?
if
you
have
to
enforce
it
that
in
order
to
make
it
viable
and
effective
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
lost
it.
you
hadn't
even
had
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
but
as
i
merely
wondered
whether
you're
saying
he
lost
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
correct
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me,
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
slade,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
you
--
you
nicely
characterize
this
as
history
crusted.do
materialmen,
in
the
situation
of
the
plaintiff
or
the
petitioner
here,
ever
give
notice
to
the
government
department
affected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
happens
then?
is
there
an
acknowledgement
or
was
it
merely
giving
notice
--
would,
in
this
case,
from
your
point
of
view,
not
made
a
--
made
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
practice
of
the
involved
government
agency
if
you
say
that
they
--
you're
sure
they
do,
what
purpose
of
this
or
what's
--
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
the
government
take
towards
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
frequent
provision
that
he
must
--
must
discharge
him
and
pay
labor
and
materialmen
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
doesn't--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
caused
a
breach.
that's
a
breach.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
brass
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
found
to
be
clear
in

on
the
actual
terms
of
the
contract,
didn't
it?
