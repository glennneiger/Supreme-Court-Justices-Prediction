mr.
samuel
d.
slade
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
could
draw
it
back
just
a
moment,
this
is
not
a
question
of
relative
lien
rights
or
any
such
thing.
this
is
a
taking
case.
these
petitioners
claim
that
the
united
states
has
taken
some
property
of
theirs
under
the
fifth
amendment
for
a
public
use.
appropriation
cases
classically
are
eminent
domain
cases,
of
course,
in
which
there
is
some
deliberate
intent
in
the
government
to
appropriate,
to
take
property
rights
in
a
private
person
and
transfer
them
to
the
united
states.
this
is
obviously
not
such
a
case
here.
related
to
those
are
the
cases
where,
without
regard
to
intent,
this
court
has
found
that
there's
been
such
a
direct
invasion
of
some
recognized
property
right
as
to
give
rise
to
an
implied
intent
to
appropriate
property
for
a
public
use.
i
submit
that
this
case
doesn't
come
anywhere
near
either
of
these
categories.
if
i
may
very
briefly
draw
it
back
to
defense,
the
contract
was
a
standard
form
contract,
a
standard
form
supply
contract
which
is
handed
out
by
years
of
experience
and
is
designed
to
meet
thousands
of
different
procurement
situations.
it
was
awarded
in
march
of
1954.
it
represented
a
firm
requirement.
this
is
important.
it
represented
a
firm
requirement
by
the
navy
for
11
personnel
boats.
it's
a
fixed
price
contract
for
$175,000.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
a
firm
requirement.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
in
march
of
1955,
work
seized
and
after
some
necessary
procedures
were
taken
and
letters
were
written,
the
government
elected
to
take
title
under
the
11
(d)
which
appears,
as
my
opponent
has
stated,
in
the
record
at
page
42.
now,
at
the
time
this
title
was
taken,
the
government
had
paid
roughly
$141,000
or
80%
of
the
fixed
price
which,
in
turn,
was
based
on
an
estimate
that
the
work
was
80%
completed.
so,
the
government
paid
for
what
had
been
done
and
it
took
it
under
the
standard
forms
default
11
(d).
now,
this
contract
was
the
only
contract
that
rice
had
from
the
date
of
its
incorporation
to
the
day
it
closed
its
doors.
the
supplies
and
materials
in
this
case
were
supplied
by
these
materialmen
to
rice
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
this
government
contract.
it
is
so
alleged
in
their
complaint.
then,
they
alleged
very
carefully
on
this
lien
point
that
when
the
government
took
title
under
11
(d)
and
the
boats
and
materials
were
removed,
where
they
were
completed,
i
might
add,
at
three
navy
yards,
philadelphia,
norfolk
and
new
york,
and
an
excess
cost
of
the
government
of
about
$146,000.
so,
it
looks
like
the
estimate
of
the
completion
by
rice
was
a
little
optimistic.
materialmen
suppliers
had
given
this
material
to
rice
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
this
one
contract
and
they
say
this.
that
under
the
maine
law,
section
13
chapter
178,
they
had
a
statutory-created
privilege
to
a
lien
to
be
enforced
by
attachment
and
so
forth.
maine
is
a
good
old
common
law
state.
the
steps
they
would
have
had
to
have
taken
to
make
this
an
enforceable
right
against
anyone
is
set
forth
in
the
sections
which
followed
chapter
13,
after
starting
an
action
with
sums
that
each
were
a
rid
of
attachment.
all
of
this
is
ancillary
to
the
claimed
obligation
against
the
debtor,
in
this
case,
rice.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
i
think
it's
a
little
unfair
to
judge
jones
to
--
as
it
were
to
stick
him
with
a
phrase,
and
i
can
quote
--
i
mean,
when
he
was
trying,
he
was
groping
for
a
shorthand
way
of
stating
what
to
us
is
a
perfectly
ordinary
situation.
take
the
--
take
the
petitioner's
theory
here.
they
are
faced
with
about
100
years
of
precedent
in
which
it's
always
been
held
that
the
government
is
not
answerable
to
the
materialmen
and
suppliers
who
deal
with
its
contractors.
the
whole
miller
act
factor
on
this
passed
put
this
in
mind,
recognizing
that
these
people
were
on
some
risk
in
recognizing
that
the
government
is
not
answerable.
well,
you
have
the
requirement
of
the
payment
fund.
again,
and
i'll
show
this
in
a
moment.
this
discharge
of
lien
provision
which
is
part
of
the
standard
form
is
again
designed
for
two
things.
one,
if
liens
are
recorded
and
known,
the
government
can,
during
the
life
of
the
contract,
require
the
contractor
to
pay.
here,
it
might
have
been
out
of
advanced
progress
payments,
protect
itself
by
recoupment,
and
at
the
same
time,
this
gives
a
measure
of
protection
to
those
who
are
dealing
with
the
contractor
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
but
the
government
is
not
answerable
for
claims
against
its
contractors.
and
i
think
judge
jones
was
trying
no
more
than
to
sum
this
situation,
which
is
a
classic
situation,
it's
not
an
innovation
by
any
means.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
the
government
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
made
a
number
of
contentions
below.
he
selected
this
--
this
path.
he
said
what
he's
saying
is
practically
speaking.
the
situation
is
just
as
though
title
passed
at
the
outset.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
title
may
pass
at
the
outset
of
a
contract.
it
may
pass
pro
tanto
under
progress
payments
clause.
it
may
pass
at
the
completion
of
the
work,
satisfactorily
performed.
or,
it
may
pass
under
11
(d),
the
default
provision.
now,
the
reason
that
11
(d)
is
important
is
this.
we
have
here,
as
i
say,
a
firm
requirement
for
certain
boats.
in
this
situation,
in
the
government
supply
contract,
the
department
involved
estimates
that
the
work
presumably
being
80%
completed,
it's
worthwhile
to
pay
the
cost
of
protecting
that
work,
transporting
it,
having
it
completed
elsewhere.
this
is
the
quickest
way
to
get
something
for
which
there
is
a
need.
had
this
been,
say,
an
electronics
contract,
it's
very
doubtful
that
the
option
under
the
default
clause
of
having
work
completed
elsewhere
would
have
been
invoked
because
electronic
contracts
normally
involve
shop
processes
and
content
readily
be
moved
from
one
shop
to
another.
again,
where
the
work
is
needed,
the
title
passing
requirement
under
11
(d)
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
contractor
from
holding
up
the
department.
if
that
provision
were
not
there,
he
might
say
“well,
i
won't
give
you
this
thing
until
you
settle
with
me
on
value
or
a
schedule
or
something
like
that.”
it
might
be
a
very
time-consuming
process.
so
that,
right
from
the
moment
of
contract,
title
may
pass
under
a
government
contract
in
various
ways
and
at
various
times.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
it
certainly
did
it
here,
pursuant
to
11
(d).
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
would
say
that,
at
the
very
beginning,
no.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
at
the
very
beginning,
there
were
various
points
when
title
could
have
passed.
one
is
on
completion
of
the
work
satisfactorily
performed.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
under
completion
of
the
work
at
the
end
of
the
contract.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no.
it
--
what
happened
here
was
that,
at
that
time,
the
work
was
80%
--
allegedly
80%
completed
and
the
contract
came
to
an
end.
we
paid
that
much
and
took
title
at
that
time
to
have
the
work
completed
elsewhere.
now,
the
language
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
under
the
maine
law
with
title
in
rice,
i
don't
know
precisely
the
dates
on
which
they
--
their
privilege
arose.
rice
entered
this
contract
in
march
1954,
presumably,
being
in
maine,
they
had
to
do
a
lot
of
work
during
the
summer
so
maybe
this
work
came
in
during
july
and
august.
now,
under
the
maine
law,
their
right
to
the
lien
arose
immediately.
they
could
have
not
been
paying
if
they
decided
not
to
extend
credit.
20
of
the
27
petitioners
here
weren't
in
maine
at
all,
so
i
don't
know
what
their
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
situation
is.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that
was
waived
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
oh,
yes
the
miller
act.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes
and
the
--
in
1941,
there
was
a
specific
provision
passed
permitting
waiver
of
payment
bond
in
certain
contracts.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
there
is
a
suggestion
at
the
end
--
in
the
reply
brief
here
that,
somehow,
the
waiver
of
that
bond
substitutes
united
states
as
answerable
to
these
claims,
but
the
legislative
history
of
that
shows
it's
for
a
different
purpose
entirely.
it
--
it
was
always
recognized,
as
it
always
has
been,
that
the
government
is
not
answerable
to
people
in
this
position.
now,
they
argue
here
from
two
clauses.
this
is
a
standard
argument
to
take
and
attack
a
title
passing
clause
by
reference
to
the
insurance
provision,
the
paramount
lien
provision,
the
discharge
lien
provision,
and
others.
this
was
discussed
at
length
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
in
his
separate
opinion
in
the
murray
corporation
case.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
against
the
united
states?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
don't
think
that's
physically
possible,
sir.
you
see,
under
the
maine
law,
the
only
way
you
enforce
this
is
to
get
on
and
have
the
sheriff
attach
it,
sue
for
an
assumptive
judgment.
getting
that
judgment,
the
property
has
to
be
seized
or
sold
to
satisfy
the
judgment.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no,
that's
the
limit.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no,
up
to
four
days.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
two
to
four
days.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
those
are
words
of
limitation.
you
can
enforce
it
any
time
up
to
that
point.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
their
right
to
perfect
their
lien
by
attachment,
yes.
their
liens
thus
became
unenforceable.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
their
conversion,
assuming
we
converted
it,
this
is
not
a
taking.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no.
in
the
first
place,
we
did
not
take
a
profit.
the
lien
that
we're
talking
about,
and
we
can't
go
beyond
--
i
can't
go
beyond
this,
the
lien
that
we're
talking
here
is
an
enforcement
right
ancillary
to
a
claim
against
rights.
this
--
the
--
the
claim
against
rights
is
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
lien
here
is
an
enforcement
device
ancillary
to
a
major
claim
against
rice,
which
has
never
gone
anywhere.
rice
is
in
bankruptcy.
these
petitioners,
among
others,
have
filed
their
claim
there.
their
lien,
in
support
of
that
major
claim,
may
have
become
utterly
unenforceable
when
title
passes
to
the
united
states
but
that
is
not
an
uncommon
situation.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
and
it's
never
been
thought
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
it's
never
been
thought
to
give
rice
to
a
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment.
it
would
be
a
very
strange
way
of
saying
that
a
lien
becomes
unenforceable
only
to
give
rice
to
a
constitutional
right
to
a
sum
of
money
in
the
same
amount.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
i'm
only
admitted
there's
an
equity
for
the
purpose
of
your
question.
actually,
there
is
none
here.
but,
in
the
case
you
give,
if
there
is
a
security
right
of
this
type,
it
has
value
only
to
the
extent
that
it
will
later
relate
to
an
obtained
judgment
against
rice.
we
don't
know.
this
is
a
claim
of
$23,000.
in
a
proper
litigation
with
rice,
rice
might
say
they
never
delivered
the
material.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
he
might
say
it
was
never
satisfactory.
we
don't
know
the
amount
of
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
with
us?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
in
the
--
in
the
state
of
maine,
in
a
proper
timely
suit
against
rice.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
or
now
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
i
think
anyone
could
have
done
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
cunard
line,
joe
smith,
anybody.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
it's
--
it's
the
question
here
is
whether
it's
a
constitutional
taking.
i'm
not
aware
that
this
court
or
any
court
has
ever
held
that
a
conversion,
a
tort,
a
frustration
of
a
contract
expectancy
or
some
such
thing
constitutes
a
fifth
amendment
taking.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
state
of
maine.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
think
not.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
i
think,
actually,
i
think
that
the
ansonia
case,
if
you
take
the
situation
before
and
after
the
statute
with
the
protective
lien,
the
paramount
lien
statute,
points
out
what
you
said
that,
in
ansonia,
two
of
the
three
ships
were
protected
only
by
liens
which
were
held
by
this
court
to
be
liens
under
contract
in
recognition
of
and
in
deference
to
state-created
and
enforceable
liens.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
nothing.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
rights
here
were
fixed
under
the
standard
form
of
contract
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
think
that's
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
think
that's
what
judge
jones
is
trying
to
say
and
i
think
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say
that,
under
a
standard
form
of
contract
which
take
various
forms,
you
can
have
a
progress
payment
clause
which
provides
the
passage
of
title
pro
tanto.
the
navy
prefers
this
one,
their
own,
where
you
have
a
paramount
lien
in
protection
of
progress
payments.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that
the
government
did
not
take
title.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
it
might
well
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
have
been.
it
might
well
have
been
under
11
(d)
that
had
these
ships
only
been
15%
completed.
but,
the
cost
of
transportation,
the
cost
of
protecting
it,
the
time
to
complete
them
elsewhere
would
have
made
taking
title
under
11
(d)
not
feasible.
in
which
case,
you
let
it
go
under
receivership
and
exercised
our
paramount
lien.
that's
one
situation
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
in
this
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
you
have
a
--
yes,
a
paramount
lien
rather
than
a
passage
of
title
under
this
provision,
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
i'm
--
the
--
the
--
i
can
only
answer
this
question
in
terms
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
what
could
they
have
done
against
this
property
while
title
was
in
the
contractor,
bearing
in
mind
that
the
united
states,
from
the
very
outset,
is
in
this
situation
in
a
variety
of
interests?
had
the
united
states,
for
example,
felt
that
rice
performed
very
poorly,
had
these
people
gone
untimely
perfected
and
made
enforceable
lien
privilege
under
the
maine
law,
had
the
united
states
decided
that
the
work
did
not
progress
far
enough
to
take
it
and
move
it
elsewhere,
they
could
have
started
a
maine
court
proceeding
in
which
we
would
have
intervened
as
paramount
lienor
and
we
would
divide
it
up,
if
there
was
anything
to
divide
up,
what
the
property
brought.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
think
they
could
have
done
that
up
to
the
time
we
made
a
decision
to
take
title.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
and
at
the
time
they
did
that,
this
might
--
i
have
to
be
a
little
harsh
in
my
answer
because,
at
the
time
they
did
that,
it
may
have
been
that
the
work
had
gone
70%,
it
may
have
been
so
needed
elsewhere
that
we
would
have
then
required
passage
of
title.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
we
would
have
gone
in
and
--
and
enforced
our
paramount
lien
in
a
state
receivership
proceeding.
that's
what
that
provision
is
for.
but,
in
this
case,
with
nothing
known,
no
recordation,
we
came
in
and
took
what
we
had
paid
for
and
we're
now
told
that,
by
doing
that
under
the
fifth
amendment,
we
have
appropriated
for
public
use
a
--
an
alleged
$23,000-claim
against
rice
for
property
furnished,
material
furnished
to
rice
sometime
in
the
past
during
the
performance
of
this
contract
and
that,
certainly,
is
not
a
taking.
it's
at
best,
the
lost
of
a
--
of
a
state-created
step
that
these
people
could
have
taken
to
enforce
a
claim,
an
assumptive
suit
against
rice
which
they
didn't
file.
now,
they
can't
--
could
have
up
until
the
fourth
day
time,
filed
their
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
invoked
and
had
the
status
of
lien-claimants
because
section
107
(b)
of
11
u.s.c.
specifically
provides
that
the
state-created
lien
rights
can
be
honored
as
such
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
providing
the
state
time
for
enforcing
them
hasn't
expired.
so,
in
that
boston
bankruptcy
proceeding,
they
might
have
a
status
of
lien
claimants,
but
that's
a
far
cry
from
saying
they
have
a
right
to
sue
the
united
states
under
the
fifth
amendment
for
appropriating
these
security
devices
for
public
use.
on
the
question
of
value,
assume
there
was
an
excess
of
value
over
what
we've
paid.
there
is,
in
boston,
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
we
paid
$141,000
and
i
assume
our
lien
would
be
for
the
same
amount.
assume
that
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
there
is
a
lien
provision,
a
paramount
lien
provision
created
pursuant
to
a
specific
statute
which
is
security
for
progress
payments,
such
as
those
that
were
made
in
this
case
from
time
to
time.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
right.
and
assume
we
brought
these
liens
in
for
that
amount.
now,
the
only
indication
at
all
of
excess
value
is
a
claim
by
the
bankrupt
that
he
spent
$190,000
which
is
nothing,
but
assume
that
--
that
had
some
validity.
there
is
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
there's
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
somewhere.
and
it
seems
to
me
he
is
the
only
one
whose
mouth
this
claim
could
be
referred
to
lie.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
for
the
benefit
of
all.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well
then
to
use
your
word
sir,
the
trustee
would
be
confronted
with
the
unusual
problem
of
suing
the
united
states
for
converting
assets
of
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
suggested
--
looking
at
the
relationship
between
the
title
that
was
taken
by
the
united
states
and
the
right
reserved
in
other
circumstances
to
have
a
paramount
lien
of
security
for
progress
payments,
it's
been
suggested
that
the
right
to
the
paramount
lien
is
somehow
merged
and
lost,
where
the
right
to
take
title
under
section
11
(d)
has
been
exercised.
now,
i
think
it's
basic
equity
law
that
while
normally,
equity
will
merge
the
junior
and
senior
estates,
it
will
not
permit
that
merger
where
there's
an
intervening
threat
as
there
clearly
is
here.
in
that
case,
the
estates
will
remain
separate
in
the
joint
holder
of
both
for
the
protection
of
the
joint
holder
of
both.
so
that
even
if
somehow,
less
than
good
title
was
taken
under
section
11,
the
united
states
would
still
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
be
possessed
of
a
perfectly
good,
outstanding
paramount
lien,
paramount,
that
is
to
the
right
to
liens
asserted
by
these
petitioners.
in
other
words,
if
we
looked
only
to
that
aspect
of
the
case,
the
paramount
lien
aspect,
we
would
now
have
the
ansonia
case,
as
the
court
will
recall
involved
three
ships.
the
benyuard,
as
to
which
title
was
taken,
that
one
is
not
really
involved
here.
the
mohawk
and
the
galveston,
as
to
which
the
government
asserted
liens
in
a
state
court
proceeding
in
virginia
as
against
other
lienholders.
this
court
held
and
properly,
that
the
liens
in
that
case
asserted
by
the
government
were
purely
the
creatures
of
contract.
an
opinion
had
actually
been
rendered
by
the
attorney
general
prior
to
the
time
that
case
arose,
that
he
was
afraid
that
the
liens
in
navies
were
using
--
were
in
recognition
of
in
deference
to
state-created
and
enforceable
liens.
and
this
court
held
that
in
that
state
receivership
proceeding,
that
the
government's
liens
to
secure
payments
on
those
two
vessels
were
junior
to
the
virginia-created
and
enforceable
liens.
however,
directly
after
that
decision,
congress
passed
the
act
of
1911
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
2.
so
that
thereafter,
the
lien
enforced
to
secure
progress
payments
where
that
was
used
instead
of
pro
tanto
passage
of
title,
would
be
paramount
to
any
state-created
and
enforceable
liens.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
11
(d)?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
the
title
passing.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
i'm
--
i'm
talking
now
of
the
--
of
the
paramount
lien
provision
on
page
36
of
the
record.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
oh,
i
--
i
would
have
to
say
yes.
that's
a
hard
case
and
it's
not
this
case,
but
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
there's
no
evidence
at
all,
except
that
we
and
the
contractor
signed
an
accord
that
we
had
paid
80%
--
an
estimated
80%
completion
of
the
contract.
among
other
things,
we've
paid
for
the
materials,
i
presume,
that
were
involved
in
this
case.it
went
into
what
we
took.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no,
it
would
become
unenforceable.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no
value.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
with
this
--
with
this
property
--
with
other
properties,
no.
real
estate,
for
example,
no,
and
that
might
be
passed
on
to
a
subsequent
purchaser
and
the
lien
would
be
fully
enforceable
again.
that's
the
alabama
case.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
against
a
subsequent
purchaser
from
the
government.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
say,
with
this
property,
no.
we
wouldn't
be
selling
these
boats
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
unless
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
and
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
and
that's
--
and
we
--
we
link
that
to
another
connection
--
contention
which
distinguishes
the
thibodo
case
which
petitioners
find
comforting.
here,
there's
an
outstanding
right
against
rice.
of
course,
rice
is
here
a
bankrupt,
that's
true.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
but
the
next
rice
may
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
next
rice
may
--
the
next
rice
may
not
be
a
bankrupt.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
but
it
does
--
it
does
give
you
a
picture
of
the
nature
of
the
lien
that
we're
talking
about.
what
kind
of
property,
if
any,
this
is.
in
the
thibodo
case,
and
this
will
point
out
the
difference
as
we
see
it.
you
have
one
of
these
western
improvement
district
schemes.
bonds
are
sold.
under
california
law,
those
bonds
become
a
present,
recorded,
perfect
right.
as
it
were,
the
bond
holders
become
partial
owners
of
the
property.
their
bonds
are
to
be
paid
interest
and
principal
out
of
assessments.
the
only
right
is
to
call
in
the
city
treasurer
to
foreclose
or
to
do
that,
themselves.
now,
the
united
states
comes
along,
and
in
an
eminent
domain
proceeding,
takes
that
property.
it
only
gives
notice
by
publication.
it
does
not
serve
these
people
whose
rights
are
recorded.
and
it
contends
that
the
real
issue
in
the
thibodo
case
was
one
of
notice.
the
court
of
appeals
holds
that,
where
that
situation
exists,
there's
no
other
right
in
these
bond
holders,
except
a
right
to
be
treated
as
partial
owners
of
this
land.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
we
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no,
i
--
i
never
--
i
said
they
had
only
a
right
to
get
a
lien.
it's
not
an
enforceable
lien
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no.
i
said
it
was
not
enforceable
because
at
no
time
prior
to
the
passage
of
title
had
they
ever
take
the
steps
under
maine
law
to
have
an
attachment
issued.
or
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
but
it's
narrowly,
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
why?
because
under
maine
law,
the
statute
says
you
will
have
a
lien
which
shall
be
enforced
by
an
attachment
made
up
to
such
and
such
a
point
of
time.
that
attachment
must
be
returned
14
days
before
the
return
term
which
it
sued
in
a
sum
suit
against
rice
as
to
be
heard.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that
was
not
done.
everybody
interested
was
to
have
notice.
then
there'd
be
a
case
in
a
sum
to
the
judgment,
one
way
or
the
other,
and
then
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
anyone
could
have
taken
that
property
at
that
time,
(inaudible)
and
joe
smith,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
once
those
boats
go
beyond
the
reach
of
maine
process,
people
in
the
position
of
these
petitioners
can't
take
the
further
steps
under
the
maine
law.
this
is
not
anything
peculiar
to
the
united
states
and
it
doesn't
give
rise
to
a
suit
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
most
were.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
act
of
1911.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no.
only
--
only
in
the
circumstance
where
the
proceeding
arises
for
the
measurement
of
relative
lien
rights.
for
example,
had
these
boats
hardly
been
completed
at
all,
had
it
not
been
worthwhile
to
take
and
move
them
to
the
north,
like
in
philadelphia,
the
government
might
very
well,
under
this
contract,
have
decided
to
let
this
thing
go
into
a
state
court,
have
this
proceeding
and
come
in
and
assert
its
liens
as
against
the
other
liens
only
to
the
extent
of
the
payments
then
made.
it
may
not
have
wanted
the
vessels
and,
as
i've
pointed
out,
i
think,
in
many
kinds
of
contracts,
they
would
not
have
wanted
to
use
replacement
contractors
and
complete
the
work.
in
that
case,
they
would
come
into
the
state
proceeding
and
use
the
paramount
lien,
an
entirely
or
alternate
form
of
protection,
entirely
separate
from
the
decision
here
to
pass
the
title
because,
here,
they
needed
the
boats
completed.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes,
i'll
--
protect
--
preserve
--
this
case
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
to
enforce
is
what
the
statute
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
looked
over
the
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
the
sheriff,
under
the
maine
law,
is
supposed
to
go
down
and
put
that
in
the
way
of
attachments
in
actual
paper.
this
is
not
a
notice
in
law.
he's
supposed
to
let
everybody
know
that's
interested.
actually,
many
of
the
cases
have
involved
purchases
of
ships,
supplies
and
other
--
other
supplies
and
so
forth.
the
sheriff
is
supposed
to
let
everyone
know.
he
would
have
had
to
let
the
united
states
know.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
in
that
circumstance,
i
think
it
would
--
in
that
case,
i
suppose,
they
would
have
gone
in
and
exercised
the
paramount
lien.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
can't
conceive
of
what
happened.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
perhaps
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
oh,
i
--
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
you
never
had
it.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
i
think
that
the
status
of
a
man
under
this
act,
before
he's
done
any
of
these
things,
is
a
little
more
than
that
of
a
general
credit
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no,
your
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
judge
jones,
while
he
may
have
been
a
little
inartistic,
is
trying
to
say
a
very
practical
and
real
thing.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
before
and
i
might,
all
the
way,
i
have
been
trying
to
say
it.
when
you
have
a
contract
entered
into
like
the
standard
form
supply
contract,
known
to
all,
to
all
--
suppliers
are
pretty
canny
men.
these
contracts
are
used
in
thousands
of
situations.
i
think
judge
jones
is
merely
trying
to
say,
given
the
--
the
history
crusted
relationship
between
materialmen
supplies
with
government
contracts
in
the
government,
they
know
that
whatever
happens
between
the
government
and
its
contractor,
under
these
standard
provisions
offering
various
options
for
various
situations
is
a
--
is
a
paramount
thing.
and
i
think
jones
is
trying
to
say
that,
for
example,
had
contract
title
passed
on
completion
and
had
it
been
developed
that
rice
had
never
paid
any
of
its
supplies
and
materialmen.
he
kept
them
at
arm's
length.
he
got
extensions
of
credit.
he
gets
a
full
$175,000
for
the
boats
and
the
united
states
takes
them.
certainly,
in
those
circumstances,
the
materialmen
supplies
couldn't
say
to
the
government,
“you
have
to
pay
twice.
you've
paid
for
everything
that's
gone
in
these
boats.
this
is
a
contract
price.
now,
you
have
to
pay
us
again
because
rice
didn't
pay
us.”
and,
that's
about
what
this
case
is
i
believe.
we're
being
asked
really
to
pay,
first,
$141,000
to
rice
which
is
the
agreed
and
estimated
percentage
of
completion.
actually,
it's
optimistic.
we
had
to
pay
a
lot
more
than
that
to
get
the
boats
finished
and
now,
we're
being
asked
to
pay
these
or
any
other
people
who
dealt
with
rice,
subsequent
to
the
time
we
executed
the
contract
and
whom
rice
didn't
pay.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
who's
ever
paid
or
not?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
you
mean
that
if
--
if
the
government
had
actually
converted
$50,000
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
taken
$150,000.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
in.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
think,
actually,
that
situation
is
covered
by
the
contract
in
this
case.
we
have,
on
page
4211,
this
provision
which
authorizes
the
government
to
take
title
under
11
(d)
isn't
just
an
act
of
force.
you
go
in
and
you
get
these
instruments,
executed
pursuant
to
these
provision.
as
agreed
on
schedules,
the
contractor
has
the
right
to
object
if
he
thinks
the
government
is
paying
for
more
than
is
taken.
if
he
does
object,
he
has
a
right
to
take
a
--
an
appeal
on
the
ground
this
is
a
question
of
fact
within
the
meaning
of
the
disputes
clause
of
the
contract.
none
of
those
things
were
done
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
contractor
has
--
well
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
the
contractor
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
in
short,
agreed
that
there
was
no
excess
value
being
taken
here.
it's
--
it's
an
inconceivable
case
to
me
that
that
would
happen.
it
certainly
hasn't
happened
here.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i'm
sorry?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
oh,
i
--
i
am
sure
they
do.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
on
page
37
of
this
record,
there
is
this
discharge
of
lien
provision.
and
if
it
comes
to
the
government's
attention
during
the
course
of
the
supply
contract
or
the
contractor's
pocketing
the
money,
progress
payments,
and
not
keeping
up
with
the
work,
this
could
give
rise
to
a
variety
of
things.
it
might,
in
itself,
be
a
cause
of
termination
in
an
unreliable
contractor.
it
might
give
rise
to
concern.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
and
if
he
doesn't
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
the
government
may
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
or
the
government
may
pay
them
and
charge
it
to
him
and
recoup
out
of
progress
payments
or
other
payments
that
are
due
and
owing.
that's
the
one
of
the
prime
purposes
of
the
discharge
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
--
of
lien
question.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
which?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
ansonia
trade
case?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes,
and
the
fact
that,
under
the
prior
attorney
general
opinion,
that
particular
lien
provision
had
been
viewed
as
perhaps
in
deference
to
state
recognized,
state-created
and
enforceable
lien.
that
was
changed
by
the
act
of
1911.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
private
contracts.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
oh,
i
--
i
see.
you
mean,
as
distinguished
from
navy
yard,
and
so
forth?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
oh,
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
you
have
to
make
a
distinction
as
to
sign.
now,
this
is
a
small
boat
contract.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
this
is
a
supply
contract.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
see
you've
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes,
i
--
i
think
so.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
i
think
so.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
against
the
government?
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
as
i
understand
it.
i'm
no
expert
on
the
practice
but
as
i
understand
the
logic
of
contracts,
there
are
always
one
of
two
things
done.
i
think
no
payment
bond
is
required
because
i
think
the
shipyards,
aircraft
companies
have
to
put
up
a
fund
to
the
government's
satisfaction
to
protect
these
people.
i
think
that
in
most
routine
cases,
there
is
a
payment
bond.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
miller
act.
in
the
miller
act,
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
in
1941,
the
provisions
of
the
miller
act,
the
secretaries
of
--
of
the
defense
departments
were
authorized
to
waive
the
provisions
of
the
miller
act
in
--
to
enable
the
smaller
people
to
get
into
government
procurement.
sureties,
inability
to
get
a
surety
bond,
the
fact
that
surety
would
intervene
and
pick
up
the
money
when
it
came,
prevent
refinancing.
these
things
were
keeping
the
smaller
people
out
of
this
kind
of
procurement
that
we
have
here.
and
it
was
felt
that
waiving
the
bond
might
give
them
the
ability
to
get
into
government
procurement
work
and
begin
to
build
up.
and
the
act
was
passed
april
1941.
but
as
i
suggest,
and
for
legislative
history
makes
it
plain
that
there
was
no
intention
of
congress,
no
circumstances
to
substitute
the
answerability
of
the
united
states
for
the
traditional
miller
act
situation.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
to
which
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
no.
the
miller
act
bond
is
for
that
purpose
and
whether
its
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
and
where
you
have
the
--
the
waiver
provision,
the
miller
act
bond
is
gone.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no,
he
is
--
his
work--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
his
work,
his
materials
are
then
at
his
risk.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
it
certainly
was.
it
enabled
them
to
get
into
procurement,
to
use
incoming
payments
for
refinancing.
it
took
the--
sometimes,
the
surety
wouldn't
let
them
get
a
new
contract
while
they
completed
the
one
in
which
his
bond
was
outstanding.
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
that
were
inhibiting
the
smaller
man
and
their
supplies
in
labors
from
getting
into
the
mainstream
of
government
procurement.
the
sureties
are
a
very
conservative
people
and
were
inhibiting
this
expansion.
