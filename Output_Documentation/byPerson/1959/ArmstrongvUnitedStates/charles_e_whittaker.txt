justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
excuse
me,
mr.
thorman.
you've
mentioned
liens
of
these
materialmen.
have
the
liens
been
perfected
or
were
they
just
rights
to
liens
in
your
view?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
--
that
was
just
my
question
and
my
point.
i
believe
thus
--
this
lien,
as
i
understood
that
statute,
could
not
be
perfected
until
the
vessel
was
launched
and
then
it
must
be
within
four
days
after
it's
launched
or
if
the
vessel
is
not
completed
when
launched,
then
within
four
days
after
the
contract
is
completed.
is
that
what
the
complex
statute
said?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
didn't
--
may
i
ask
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
that
have
the
effect
of
foreclosing
the
government's
lien
and
merging
it
being
titled?s
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
it,
if
i
may
ask
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
was
no
determination
or
effort
(inaudible)
whether
this
property
had
a
value
in
excess
of
the
government's
lien
at
the
time
the
government
acquired
title.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
your
claim
that
there
was
equity
for
the
second
lien
holders,
mainly,
your
client,
which
was
converted
by
the
government
in
the
acquisition
of
title
and
the
removal
of
the
goods
so
you
couldn't
perfect
your
lien?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
i
didn't
follow
at
all.
the
fact
that
certain
moneys
had
been
spent
wouldn't
establish
value,
would
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
there
wasn't
equity,
a
value
in
this
case,
in
excess
of
the
government's
lien
and
you
claim
you're
entitled
to
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
the
taking
of
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
do
you
have
to
show
they
had
some
value?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
--
how
do
you
determine
that
value,
except
to
show
that
there
was
an
equity
in
the
goods
in
excess
of
the
government's
lien.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
be
the
amount
of
your
lien.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it
didn't
--
be
the
value
of
your
lien,
too,
would
it?
suppose
the
lien
couldn't
have
any
value
if
there
was
no
equity
and
they
would
have
if
there
was
an
equity.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
at
that
point.
seeing
that
you
are
right
that
the
contract
contemplated
liens
by
materialmen,
mature
materialmen,
and
you
applied
validly
under
state
law.
you
know
not
the
fact
that
you're
getting
that
question.
then,
the
government
takes
over,
just
arbitrarily,
by
a
demand
and
gets
a
conveyance.
this
destroyed
your
lien.
would
you
not
have
to
show
then,
however,
to
recover
in
this
suit
that
they
had
some
value?
the
lien
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
rights.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
in
other
words,
that
being
taken
over
by
the
government
had
a
value
in
excess
of
the
government's
valid
first
lien
to
which
you
were
junior.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
there's
been
no
finding
as
to
that
question
by
any
court.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
slade,
may
i
ask
you
this.
following
up
on
questions
of
the
chief
justice,
i
haven't
yet
gotten
at
least
an
understanding
of
this
decision.
do
you
agree
that
these
materialmen
and
mechanics,
in
light
of
that,
have
a
valid
lien
under
section
13
chapter
178
of
the
maine
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
against
the
ship,
against
these
hauls.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright,
now
then
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
lien
was
perfectible
in
the
manner
provided
in
that
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
let's
assume
that
it
was
outstanding
on
august
4,
1955
at
the
time
you,
the
government,
exercising
rights
on
your
contract,
required
the
contractor
to
convey
the
ships
to
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
can
only
be
done
under
the
statute
within
certain
periods
of
time.
four
days
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
within
four
days
after
launching,
for
example.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
may
be
enforced
by
title
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
within
four
days
after
the
launching.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright,
but
you
still
have
that
much
time
within
which
to
do
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
let's
assume
that
they
had
this
lien
and
the
time
hadn't
expired
(inaudible)
when
you
took
over
the
property.
did
that
then
destroy
their
right
to
perfect
their
lien?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
they're
worthless
from
that
day
on.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
right?
now
then
--
now,
let's
assume
that
the
goods
at
that
time,
these
forms
have
a
value
much
in
excess
of
the
government's
prior
lien,
admittedly
a
problem.
did
you
not
convert
their
property
then
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
the
extent
that
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
why
isn't
it?
a
conversion
is
a
taking.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
whether
uncommon
or
not.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
you
take
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
you'd
foreclosed
your
lien
in
some
way
that
was
applicable
and
had
title
in
that
manner
which
extinguished
the
second
lien
that
would
be
one
thing.
but,
if
you
come
in
and
without
foreclosure
of
your
prior
lien,
admitting
there's
an
equity
in
excess
of
it
would
simply
convert
the
property,
haven't
you
then
taken
property
of
junior
lien
honors?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
isn't
there
some
ways
where
the
second
lien
must
have
the
right
to
litigate
that
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
with
respect
to
the
liens,
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
that
was
again
his
money.
you've
taken
the
purpose,
the
thing
on
which
the
lien
would
attach
is
perfected.
clear
out
the
jurisdiction
at
the
time
when
they
still
had
rice
to
perfect
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
wouldn't
that
be
conversion?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do
know
what
you
paid
over
your
lien,
don't
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
subject
incurred
was
not
an
asset
that
could
possibly
deprive
on
all
that
it
required
but
it
has
been
required
to
the
(inaudible)
invades
it
and
you
took
it
out
its
jurisdiction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
section
11
(d)
(inaudible)
to
that
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
(inaudible)6
is
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
wasn't
done.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
then
what
is
involved
in
(inaudible)
under
the
law
of
maine?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
doesn't
that
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
the
--
this
clause
isn't
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
in
which
the
titles
(inaudible)
to
adopt.
do
you
hold
that
the
(inaudible)
were,
under
the
judicial
law,
inferior
to
the
lien
covered?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then
after
congress
asked
(inaudible)
filed
in
the
suit.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
gives
the
government
(inaudible)
but
doesn't
that
still
mean
that
the
state
liens
are
valid,
but
junior?
