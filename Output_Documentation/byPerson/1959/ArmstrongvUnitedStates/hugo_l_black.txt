justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
your
lien
created?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
that
$141,000-lien
created?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
that
--
that
is
for
the
exact
amount
that
you
had
paid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
slade
--
excuse
me
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i'm
still
not
absolutely
clear
on
what
your
contention
is.
i'm
sure
it's
my
fault.
but
i'd
like
to
give
you
an
illustration
to
see
if
i
can
make
it
clear,
my
question
here.
suppose
the
government
had
paid
$100,000
to
rice,
the
value
of
what
had
been
constructed
up
to
that
time
was
worth
$150,000
and
this
--
these
maine
people
would
supply
the
labor
and
material
had
a
$50,000-claim.
is
it
your
contention
that
when
you
--
when
you
have
that
title
transferred,
their
lien
is
lost
so
far
as
the
ship
is
concerned?
i'm
not
talking
about
the
bank
here.
i'm
talking
about
the
ship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
don't
know
yet
how
much
--
how
near
this
case
is
to
it
because
there's
been
no
evidence,
has
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
that
were
to
happen,
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
suppose
that
that
case
did
occur.
the
government
had
the
ship
transferred
to
itself
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
assume
that
you
would
say
that
these
lienholders
could
not
sue
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that,
so
far
as
they
are
concerned,
at
that
time,
their
lien
would
be
destroyed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unenforced,
whether
it
will
become
valueless.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
become
valueless
like
a
--
like
a
land
that
the
waters
run
over
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
lien
would
be
fully
enforceable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
you're
not
going
to
sell
the
ship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
what
you're
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
so,
what
you're
saying
is,
and
maybe
you're
right,
i
don't
--
i'm
--
at
last,
now,
i
am
--
i
understand
a
little
better.
what
you're
saying
is
that
no
lien
can
be
obtained
under
any
state
law
which
deprives
the
government,
which
has
a
contract
with
a
private
corporation
to
build
a
ship,
that
no
state
lien
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
be
put
on
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
can
be
saved
from
the
government
if
it
wants
to
take
over.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
--
whether
it
takes
it
over
--
whether
its
lien
is
worth
as
much
as
the
other
lien
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
is
bankrupted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
this
case,
we
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
assume
that
it's
no
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here
you
have
--
i
don't
quite
get
it
yet.
why
do
you
claim
that
the
government
--
why
is
it
right
or
correct
as
authorized
by
any
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
that's
--
destroy
a
lien
which
is
a
valid
lien,
i
understand
you
to
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
it's
not
enforceable,
you
say,
because
it's
on
property
that
the
government
has
hired
somebody
to
construct
but
which
it
has
not
yet
taken
over.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then,
you
are
saying
that
they've
lost
their
lien
under
maine
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
that
(inaudible)
answering?
i'm
--
i'm
still
now
a
little
disturbed
again
by
what
you
said.
does
the
government
have
a
lot
of
private
contracts
with
people
that
build
ships,
airplanes,
and
various
other
government
equipment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
very
large
part
of
the
government
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
this
one
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
i'm
talking
about
the
general
line
of
business.
does
the
government
make
or
have
a
lot
of
contract
on
the
cost
plus
or
--
or
let
them
out
on
such
bids
and
things
like
the
aircraft
companies
or
contractors
or
persons
who
build
things
for
the
government,
construct
things
for
the
government?
i'm
not
talking
about
building
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
ships.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
planes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
various
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
understand
your
argument,
and
it
may
be
right.
does
anyone,
any
laborer
who
works
for
them
anywhere
in
the
united
states
or
any
man
who
supplies
material
to
the
contractor
can
get
no
lien
under
state
law
or
any
other
law
that's
enforceable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
against
the
thing
that
--
that
is
to
be
built
in
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
way
to
get
it.
it
just
destroys
them
entirely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
wasn't
--
why
was
it
not
utilized
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
was
a
distinct
purpose
in
the
passage
of
that
act,
wasn't
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
enable
people
who
worked
for
these
companies,
laborers
and
people
who
supplied
the
material
to
get
protection
from
the
miller
act
for
a
bond.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
it's
for,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
the
miller
act
is
--
if
the
department
waives
the
miller
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
the
fellow
--
the
man
who
does
the
work
or
supplies
the
material
has
no
--
can
get
no
enforceable
lien
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
has
to
take
the
risk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
still
--
i'm
a
little
at
a
loss
now
in
your
claim.
what
you
contend.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
if
you
--
if
you
could
sue
the
government
for
compensation,
what
in
your
judgment,
is
the
measure
of
your
damage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
claim
that
you
could
--
that
the
government
would
lose
any
part
of
its
lien?
are
you
claiming
that
you
could
collect
$41,000
even
though
the
government
had
paid
out,
had
already
paid
into
that
fund,
enough
to
absorb
the
full
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
i
don't
care
about
the
exact
amount.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
claim
you
can
destroy
any
part
of
the
government's
lien
by
this
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
the
government
has
taken
this
over,
as
it
had
a
right
to
do
under
its
contract,
we'll
assume.
and
it
had
paid
$141,000
or
whatever
it
is,
and
that's
--
it
had
a
lien
for
that
exact
amount.
do
you
claim
that
because
they
have
destroyed
the
lien
of
yours
but
you
say
is
worth
$23,000
that
you
can
nevertheless
collect
$23,000
from
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
interested
in
the
amount
of
damages
you
claim
you
can
get
in
this
lawsuit
in
connection
with
the
government's
lien.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
what
it's
gained
but
what
it
might
lose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
claiming
that
by
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
are
you
claiming
that
by
this
form
of
lawsuit,
although
you
had
a
junior
lien
to
the
government,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
government
had
this
--
transferred
to
itself,
you
can
recover
the
full
value
of
your
junior
lien?
is
that
your
contention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
it
be
just
compensation
if
it
wasn't
just,
if
you
were
not
entitled
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
attacking
its
lien.
are
you
attacking
its
superiority
to
yours?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
claim
that
by
the
reason
of
the
government
taking
it
over,
if
you
could
yet
to
sue
the
government
for
just
compensation,
that
you
can
put
yours
first
and
get
every
dime
of
yours
even
though
if
the
government
loses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
still
hasn't
done
it.
the
--
the
justice
of
the
claim
is
still
there,
isn't
it?
it's
between
you
two,
assuming
that
you're
right
in
your
claim
that
you
ought
to
get
what
you
actually
lost.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now,
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
now,
you
--
i
can
understand
that
you're
claiming
that
if
the
government
didn't
have
a
lien
for
100
or
was
getting
more
than
it
should
get
for
its
lien,
that
you're
entitled
to
recover.
i
can
understand
that.
but
i
understood
you
to
tell
me
a
while
ago,
maybe
i
was
wrong,
that
even
if
the
government
lien
is
superior
to
yours
and
they've
taken
it
over
and
the
government's
lien
is
for
every
cent
of
the
value
of
that
property
that
nevertheless,
by
the
reason
of
the
fact
that
they've
taken
it
over,
you
can
sue
them
for
just
compensation
and
get
the
full
value
of
your
subordinate
lien.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
claiming
that
since
they
chose
the
wrong
method
of
procedure,
you
can
take
something
that
had
no
value
at
all
in
the
beginning
because
they
had
a
lien
for
more
than
its
worth
and
you
can
take
that
nothing
and
make
it
recover
from
the
government
the
full
value
of
your
--
the
full
non-value
of
your
lien?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
couldn't
you
get
it
subjected
to
the
light
of
day
if
you
are
right
in
saying
your
lien
has
been
destroyed
and
the
property
is
--
the
government
has
taken
it?
wouldn't
it
be
exposed
to
the
light
of
day
if
the
court
of
claims
should
try
out
that
issue
and
see
whether
or
not
you
did
have
any
lien
that
was
worth
anything
and
was
taken?
