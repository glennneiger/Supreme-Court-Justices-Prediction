mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief

earl

mr.
manoli.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
any
place
in
the
united
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
manoli,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
manoli,
i
--
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
the
hearing
examiner
refused
to
find
the
unions
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
he
found
that
they've
been
goaded
into
this
by
the
--
by
the
employer
or
some
to
that
effect.
now
when
the
court
made
its
order
or
when
the
board
made
its
order
did
it
find
that
the
company
did
not
go
with
the
unions
into
this
conduct
or
did
they
just
--
did
it
just
find
that
on
balance
they
were
still
--
they
were
still
liable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
conclusion.
yes,
i
understood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
the
board
so
find?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
you
are
speaking
of
the
national
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
paid
the
salaries
--
who
paid
the
salaries
and
wages
of
these
--
these
outsiders
who
came
in
during
the
strike?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
know
but
--
but
under
those
circumstances,
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
these
people
came
from
another
telephone
company
with
which
these
people
were
affiliated
or
were
friendly
or
whether
they
--
they
came
from
an
entirely
different
source,
what,
so
far
as
the
--
the
conduct
of
the
international
union,
what
difference
does
it
make?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
that
--
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
main
reason
or
--
or
the
reason
that
--
that
the
unions
performed
these
acts
on
the
--
the
outsiders
was
because
they
came
from
affiliated
companies
instead
of
just
being
employed
at
large
from
other
sources?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
would
--
what
--
did
they
--
did
the
unions
make
any
distinction
as
to
whether
they
came
from
other
telephone
companies
or
whether
they
came
off
the
street?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
the
point
--
point
is,
as
i
understand
it,
you
--
you
sustain
this
order
because
as
against
the
other
employers
because
you
say
there
were
--
there
were
employees
of
whether
employers
were
engaging
in
these
so-called
strike
breaking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
i
want
--
what
i
want
to
know
is,
is
there
any
distinction
in
law
between
those
people
and
people
who
were
recruited
in
some
other
way
or
if
they
--
and
if
there
is,
was
there
any
distinction
made
between
the
two
classes
of
employments
by
the
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now
i
don't
want
--
i
don't
want
to
take
anymore
of
your
time
now.
give
me
a
couple
of
minutes
where
the
time
i
take
it
from
mr.
manoli
but,
then
you
may
have
a
couple
of
minutes
extra
too
counsel,
but
--
but
my
point
is
--
is
this.
suppose
that
in
this
case,
these
outsiders
had
no
connection
of
any
kind
with
any
telephone
companies
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
the
conduct
on
both
sides
was
the
same
and
the
order
is
as
it
is
in
this
case.
do
you
think
that
that
--
that
set
facts
would
have
the
same
effective
purpose
of
sustaining
your
injunction
as
this
one
where
they
just
happened
to
come
from
other
companies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
pick
the
weakest
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
if
they
didn't
come
from
other
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
coming
from
employers,
they
were
just
employed.
they
were
just
employed
for
the
purpose
of
filling
with
places
of
these
strikers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
not
weaken
your
--
not
weaken
your
position
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
i'm
talking
about
legal,
the
legal
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
weaken
your
legal
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
by
that
then
that
it
would
make
no
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
how
about
legally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
mean
there's
no
distinction
between
the
two
legally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
just
yes
or
no,
that's
all
i'm
asking.
you
can
get
rid
of
me
in
a
minute
if
you
just
tell
me
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
alright.
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
manoli,
am
i
quite
--
is
not
taken
care
of
there
at
all
because
you
made
the
major
argument
in
your
brief
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
basis
that
these
people
were
recruited
from
affiliated
companies.
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
could
you
make
the
same
argument
and
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument
based
on
the
same
legal
premise
if
those
employees
had
not
come
for
those
companies
and
if
they
have
been
recruited
in
some
other
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
didn't
asked
you
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
have
ordered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
legal
question
should
be
the
same.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
manoli,
i'm
concern
you're
wasting
your
time
talking
to
me
about
what
the
board
would
do.
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
asked
you
what
your
legal
position
was
and
if
you
can't
answer
that
why?
we
just
forget
about
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
go
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goldthwaite.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
pages
is
that
you
say?

justice
