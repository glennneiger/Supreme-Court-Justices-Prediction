creates
the
question.
interestingly,
that
was
in
my
mind
and
i'm
not
the
only
who
figure
(inaudible).
i
understood
you
can
say
that
if
the
employer
was
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
discriminating
against
members
of
au
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
of
mu.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
your
--
the
order
of
the
board
would
enjoin
him
from
--
in
the
future,
discriminating
against
members
of
m
or
x,
y
and
z,
comprehensive.
in
other
words,
there
--
there
is
a
great
distinction
between
and
is
far
greater.
there
is
a
distinction
in
fact
between
enjoining
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
hindering
types
of
practices.
and
the
scope
and
the
range
of
the
application
of
the
enjoined
factors
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
parties
outside
those
before
the
court
and
i
can
--
even
for
the
board.
i
can
even
see
a
difference
between
enjoining
the
employers
from
unfair
labor
practices
against
all
sorts
of
union
because
all
sorts
of
different
relationships
is
this
between
employers
and
specifically
familiar
to
you,
and
enjoining
a
particular
employers,
at
least
with
unions
against
practices
of
the
same
kind
no
matter
where
those
practices
maybe
operated.
and
i
--
this
is
as
far
as
i
know
of
and
must
have
been
--
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
we
have,
is
it
not?
which
is
type
of
order
and
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
where
there
is
a
finding
and
for
our
purposes,
unquestioned
findings.
we're
here
dealing
merely
with
the
remedy.
where
there
is
a
finding
of
coercive
or
violent
practice,
exercised
by
union
as
against
the
employer
a,
may
even
say
the
union
we
--
you'll
--
will
also
enjoin
against
asserting
or
exercising
that
factors
against
any
other
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
issue
is
a
very
different
one
from
enjoining
light
tight
and
between
the
same
parties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
denying
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
start
with
the
different
and
external
fact,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
it's
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
offending
party
in
this
case
is
the
international
union
not
a
local?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
but
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
essential
--
you
wouldn't
be
enjoining
a
local
which
only
operates
within
a
given
area
outside
of
its
area.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
--
to
what
general
offices
did
you
bring
now
in
this
--
of
this
conduct
shown?
to
what
--
to
what
offices
of
the
international?
how
high
in
the
hierarchy
of
its
issues
then
do
you
trace
responsibility
for
this
conduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
don't
--
you're
talking
in
--
in
corporate
term
the
international.
i
want
to
know
to
what
name
of
the
officials
among
the
top
officers
of
the
union
did
you
bring
home
this
conduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
quite
that.
specifically
how
high
among
the
office
of
the
international,
did
you
trace
responsibility
because
the
international
might
be
liable
on
principles
and
agents
for
local
people
representing
the
international,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
of
my
question
is
blank.
i'm
not
worrying
about
the
justification
for
holding
the
international
but
for
me,
at
least
it
is
relevant
in
determining
what
kind
of
restriction
you
place
upon
the
international
in
the
future
to
note
what
extent
the
directing
blame
or
in
part
at
least
to
high
officers
of
the
international?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
think,
from
your
point
of
view,
you
think
my
inquiry
is
a
relevant
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
you
are
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
an
answer
to
the
inquiry
of
the
chief
justice
that
the
record
shows
that
in
this
case
the
international
for
appropriate
official
combined
them
for
that
matter
controversy
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
international
for
those
capable
of
binding
them,
did
bind
them
in
this
situation,
brought
in
and
they
were
brought
in
(inaudible)
--
toward
in
certain
countries
volunteers
from
other
employers
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
company
and
that
in
this
connection
you're
trying
to
safeguard
by
a
general
order,
that
kind
of
repetition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
said
a
word
about
the
potential
hazard
of
such
a
broad
order,
the
changes
of
a
contempt
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
it
been
such
a
broad
order
in
relation
to
contempt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
it.
we
have
to
really
fight
on
this
difficulty,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
had
had
from
experience
with
a
problem
of
establishing
it
or
disapproving.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
kind
of
connection
mr.
manoli
as
you
well
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
before
the
board?
was
there
a
hearing
on
the
examiners
before,
an
oral
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
exceptions
were
taken
by
the
board
i
take
it
through
the
test
examiner's
finding
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
general
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
replied
i
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
union
didn't
respond.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
no
response?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
nothing
was
asked
by
the
union,
no
findings
were
requested,
they
stood
patterns
were
on
the
examiner's
report,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know
but
they
don't
usually
assume
that
they
must
learn
about.
that's
not
on
this
very
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
as
to
the
facts
which
--
which
you
are
now
pressing
on
us
and
you
answered
it
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
that
the
report
of
the
--
that
the
union
just
relied
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
brushed
at
all
but
it
ends
on
more
on
the
assumption
that
--
that
there
was
something
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
order
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
some
basis
for
making
it
in
the
evidence,
was
there
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
board
then
rejected
that
deduction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
entered
an
order
on
the
basis
of
the
union
misconduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
included
the
interrelationship
between
not
only
the
employees
of
this
company,
but
also
outsiders,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
they
didn't
themselves
to
the
broad
order,
but
the
fact
in
the
record
they
made
their
order
drawn
out
of
the
facts
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
your
real
grievance
abstractly,
the
questions
aside,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
disregard
them
because
i
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
hurt
you
if
this
order
stands?
what
would
hurt
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
it
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
we
said
that
such
suit
was
instituted
in
the
place
where
they
are
alleged
to
have
occurred,
would
that
help
you
in
interest
of
venue
problem
for
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
ask
this
court
to
review
the
order
of
the
board
on
the
ground
of
it,
that
in
that
it
is
grounded
in
having
found
the
--
the
international
