mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
it's
always
a
pleasure
to
be
here
in
this
spot.
this
case
comes
here
from
the
sixth
circuit
by
way
of
writ
of
certiorari.
the
principal
question
for
the
decision
of
--
of
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
order
of
the
labor
board
which
was
enforced
by
the
sixth
circuit
is
too
broad
and
that
it
enjoined
the
petitioner,
both
petitioners
from
interfering
with
restraining
the
employees
of
any
employer
including
of
the
--
of
the
primary
employer
and
those
of
any
other
employer.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
language
or
any
other
employer
is
too
broad.
the
rule
which
was
announced
by
this
court
in
1941
in
the
express
publishing
company
case
has
stood
and
has
been
adhered
to
in
all
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
courts
of
appeal.
it's
all
for
that
rule
in
substance
was
that
the
order
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
towards
the
decree
of
the
sixth
circuit,
to
paraphrase,
must
be
bottomed
in
the
record.
the
evidence
must
authorize
a
conclusion
that
the
unfair
--
or
they
must
authorize
the
board
to
issue
an
order
and
that
the
evidence
must
show
what
unfair
labor
practices
were
committed
and
the
order
should
be
restricted
to
those
unless
there
are
other
circumstances
of
such
as
a
past
history
of
misconduct
of
a
similar
type
or
an
affirmative
showing
on
the
record
that
the
respondent
before
the
labor
board
intends
to
extend
the
conduct
to
some
other
employers.
otherwise,
this
court
has
held
that
the
scope
of
the
board's
order
must
be
restricted
to
the
parties
involved.
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioners
as
the
--
i
think
the
primary
collateral
question
for
decision
which
goes
into
the
principal
one
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record,
either
by
way
of
direct
evidence
or
by
way
of
history
from
which
a
--
a
broad
order
could
be
based.
and
that
the
counsel
for
the
national
labor
relations
board,
when
they
--
and
for
the
first
time
injected
into
the
case
by
way
of
their
briefs
in
the
sixth
circuit
the
fact
that
there
had
been
two
previous
compromise
settlements
of
other
labor
board
cases
in
which
one
of
the
petitioners
here,
the
communications
workers,
had
been
a
party.
those
were
compromise
settlements
and
it
is
our
positioned
if
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
other
than
those
compromise
settlements
which
should
not
be
considered
by
the
court.
the
case
arises
out
of
a
strike
at
ohio
consolidated
telephone
company
in
portsmouth,
ohio
which
began
in
july,
1956.
the
communications
workers
of
america
was
the
collective
bargaining
representative
for
the
employees
of
the
ohio
consolidated
telephone
company
for
a
period
of
14
years
previous
to
july
1956.
the
communications
workers
of
america
is
a
national
labor
organization
operating
through
out
the
united
states
and
also
in
the
dominion
of
canada.
it
has
about
730
local
unions
and
it
has
contracts
with
over
100
different
employers.
it
also
--
seeks
to
organize
and
to
represent
the
employees
of
other
employers.
the
scope
of
the
order
enjoining
it
from
interfering
with
or
restraining
the
employees
of
the
ohio
consolidated
telephone
company
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
under
section
7
of
the
act
or
the
employees
of
any
other
employer
would
authorize
an
extension
of
the
order
to
cover
all
of
those
100
employers
and
their
employees
throughout
the
united
states.
when
the
strike
occurred
in
july
of
1956,
three
local
unions
who
administer
the
contract
with
ohio
consolidated
telephone
company
went
out
on
strike.
the
petitioner
here,
local
4372,
it
res
--
is
--
has
jurisdiction
or
has
as
its
members,
those
employees
who
reside
in
portsmouth,
ohio
and
vicinity.
the
other
two
local
unions
who
were
not
made
respondents
before
the
labor
board
also
went
out
on
strike.
during
the
course
of
the
strike,
ohio
consolidated
continued
to
operate
its
telephone
facilities
enforcement
and
elsewhere
in
ohio
by
using
supervisory
employees
who
were,
carried
on
his
own
payroll,
his
own
supervisory
employees.
its
confidential
secretaries
to
management
officials
--
management
officials
and
other
employees
possibly
appeal
--
grow
more
of
--
of
a
clerical
nature
who
were
not
represented
by
the
communications
workers
and
its
local
unions
in
their
bargaining
capacity.
it
also
used
in
order
to
carry
on
the
telephone
operation
during
the
strike
supervisory
employees
of
other
affiliated
telephone
companies.
the
record
shows
that
ohio
consolidated
telephone
company
is
one
of
the
subsidiary
companies
or
sister
companies
as
referred
to
of
the
general
telephone
system
which
is
a
system
of
telephone
companies
roughly
comparable
or
not
in
--
so
as
to
the
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company
which
operates
of
course
a
nationwide
telephone
system
composed
of
a
number
of
operating
companies
and
other
facilities.
general
telephone
company
is
substantially
similar.
among
its
subsidiary
companies
are
general
telephone
company
of
ohio,
general
telephone
company
of
west
virginia,
general
telephone
company
of
pennsylvania,
general
telephone
company
of
the
south
west
and
i
believe
there's
one
in
illinois
and
ohio
consolidated
telephone
company.
during
the
period
of
the
strike,
supervisory
employees
from
these
various
sister
operating
companies
were
loaned
to
ohio
consolidated
telephone
company.
during
the
period
of
the
strike,
they
worked
side
by
side
with
the
ohio
consolidated's
own
supervisory
employees
and
were
under
the
direction
and
control
of
ohio
consolidated
management.
they
did
not
take
any
orders
or
did
not
receive
their
orders
from
the
--
their
primary
employers,
the
other
companies
of
the
general
system
who
carried
them
on
their
payroll.
they
--
the
record
shows
that
they
were
paid
for
this
work
by
their
primary
employer,
all
of
the
primary
employer
did
direct
the
performance
of
the
work.
however,
the
primary
employer
with
various
other
operating
companies
of
the
general
system
build
ohio
consolidated
for
the
salaries
of
their
supervisory
employees
for
the
work
which
was
performed
during
the
strikes
and
ohio
consolidated
retained
its
sister
companies
for
the
work
performed
so
that
substantially,
they
will
--
the
--
borrow
the
employees
were
carried
on
ohio
consolidated's
payroll
for
all
practical
purposes.
it's
the
contention
of
the
labor
board
as
i
understand
it
that
the
fact
that
these
supervisory
employees
were
the
regular
employees
of
some
other
employers,
justifies
the
extension
of
the
order
to
cover
other
employers
than
those
or
the
employees
of
other
employers
than
the
(voice

primary
employer.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
if
the
picketing
of
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
was
a
--
there
were
a
number
of
instances
of
violence.
they
took
place
at
the
entrance,
it
took
place
entrance
to
exchanges,
it
took
place
at
--
play
at
locations
where
these
supervisory
employees
were
attempting
to
work
on
lines
and
poles
and
other
telephone
company
facilities.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
ohio
consolidated.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
--
everything
occurred
within
the
operating
territory
of
ohio
consolidated
and
the
--
the
--
these
employees
of
other
sister
companies
were
working
right
along
side
of
and
with
and
under
ohio
consolidated's
own
supervisory
employees
and
under
the
instructions
of
ohio
consolidated
management
at
the
time.
now,
the
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
understand
that
is
the
labor
board's
argument.
it's
our
position
that
they
were
not
--
that
they
were
employees
of
ohio
consolidated
(voice
overlap).
sir?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well,
there's
one
other
thing
that
we
argue.
as
i
construe
the
brief
and
--
and
as
i
construe
their
arguments
in
the
circuit
court
was
that
--
may
--
may
i
digress
and
come
back
to
your
answer,
justice?
there
were
a
number
of
instances
of
--
of
threats
and
--
and
some
actual
violence
on
the
part
of
the
members
and
officers
of
--
of
the
petitioner,
local
4372.
there
was
no
act
of
violence
shown
in
the
record
of
intended
or
alleged
by
either
of
the
other
two
local
unions
who
were
on
strike.
only
the
members
and
officers
of
that
one
local
union
engaged
in
any
acts
of
violence.
all
of
the
acts
of
violence
which
are
shown
in
the
record
with
one
exception
were
directed
towards
the
supervisory
employees
of
ohio
consolidated
and
the
--
those
of
the
sister
companies.
there
was
one
exception,
and
ms.
maynard
who
was
a
confidential
secretary
to
the
vice
president
of
the
telephone
company
was
interfered
with
in
going
into
an
exchange
on
one
occasion
and
she
said
she
didn't
want
to
work
anyway
and
--
and
left
and
came
back
and
went
to
work
later.
but
there
was
a
lot
of
publicity,
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
answer
to
your
question
concerning
these
various
acts
of
violence
which
were
directly
towards
supervisory
employees.
the
--
the
labor
board
contended
that
because
employ
--
as
i
construe
their
contention
that
because
employees
of
other
employers
disassociated
from
the
labor
dispute
may
have
heard
through
the
radio,
the
newspaper,
of
the
fact
that
there
was
violence
at
ohio
consolidated.
they
were
put
on
the
notice
that
the
employees
were
--
would
engage
in
an
act
to
violence
to
prevent
somebody
from
working
during
the
strike.
now,
that
i
hadn't
given
much
consideration
to
as
been
a
substantial
argument
at
all
because
these
people,
members
of
the
public
in
general
were
not
in
the
relationship
of
employer
and
employee
or
labor
union
to
employee
of
the
disputants.
and
in
that
--
all
i
can
say
to
that
is
if
the
labor
board
can
--
can
restrain,
issue
a
broad
--
broad
order
on
that
basis,
it
--
it
means
that
congress
has
given
to
the
labor
board
that
primary
function
of
controlling
violence
in
--
in
general.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
does.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
what's
our
opposition
now
are
based
upon
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
the
may
department
stores
case
that
it
is
broad
enough,
where
the
board
--
the
--
the
board's
order
says
the
respondent
union,
communications
workers
of
america,
which
operates
nationally
is
restrained
and
enjoined
from
interfering
with
course
and
interfering
with
the
employees
of
ohio
consolidated
company
or
any
other
employer
from
the
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights.
that
necessarily
or
the
worst
or
any
other
employer
extend
to
the
entire
operations
of
cwa
throughout
the
united
states
and
it
would
include
the
bell
system
where
they
represent
some
300,000
or
400,000
employees
and
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
could
--
i
think
they
do.
i
think,
but
how
will
they
say
that
--
that
we've
got
to
show
agency.
and
my
construction
of
what
their
brief
says
is
that
they
agree
that
it
does
extend
throughout
the
united
states
to
any
employer,
yes
sir.
but
that
--
that
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
board
to
--
before
we
could
be
held
in
contempt
to
show
that
the
union
was
responsible
on
that
theory's
principles
or
for
the
violence
involving
other
--
employees
of
other
employers.
these
supervisory
employees,
i
think
the
--
regardless
of
whose
payroll
they
would
carry
it
on
clearly,
when
the
employees
of
ohio
consolidated
telephone
company
at
the
time
and
place
where
this
incidents
occurred.
and
that's
the
status
of
the
record
at
time
it
went
into
the
court
of
appeals.
we
took
issue
with
the
enforcement
in
order
to
limit
the
application
of
the
order
to
the
employees
of
ohio
consolidated
who
were
the
only
employees
who
were
involved
in
the
labor
dispute.
in
the
complaint
which
was
filed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
the
only
specific
acts
charged
of
against
the
respondents
for
violating
the
law
in
every
case,
the
only
specific
act
is
that
by
a
threat
or
by
an
actual
violence,
the
company
--
the
union
interfered
with
supervisory
employees
of
the
employer
in
the
performance
of
their
work.
there
is
no
specific
allegation
in
the
complaint
of
any
other
acts
and
there
is
no
--
though,
as
i
say,
there
was
no
showing
in
the
evidence
that
any
act
of
violence
was
directed
toward
any
employees
other
than
the
supervisory
employees
who
were
working
for
ohio
consolidated,
other
than
the
one
incidents
where
the
secretary
of
the
manager,
the
vice-president
was
asked
not
to
enter
an
exchange.
in
that
status
of
the
record,
we
ask
the
court
of
appeals
not
to
enforce
the
broad
language.
and
in
--
in
the
--
in
their
brief,
counsel
for
the
labor
board
took
the
position
that
the
board
was
authorized
to
issue
a
board
order
because
the
communications
workers,
not
--
not
the
local.
now
the
local
was
not
a
party
to
these
agreements
because
the
communications
workers
had
previously
entered
into
consent
settlements
of
two
unfair
labor
practice
cases
in
which
it
agreed
that
it
would
not
interfere
with
or
restrain
the
employees
of
an
employer
by
acts
of
violence.
each
one
of
those
consented
agreements
which
were
unpublished
agreements,
they
were
not
published
decisions
of
the
board.
each
one
of
them
contained
a
specific
provision
that
the
execution
of
the
agreement
concluding
our
case
did
--
was
not
an
admission
by
the
communications
workers
that
they
had
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
was
a
typical
compromised
settlement
agreement.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
what
--
what
happened
in
all
that,
the
trial
examiner
heard
it,
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
--
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
he
found
that
the
members
of
the
local
union
may
have
acted
improperly.
however,
he
found
that
all
of
the
--
the
violence
was
incited
by
ohio
consolidated
telephone
company
and
that
ohio
consolidated
in
following
the
charge
with
the
labor
board
came
before
the
board
with
dirty
hands,
unclean
hands.
and
as
a
matter
of
policy,
he
found
it
would
not
effectuate
the
policy
of
the
act
for
the
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
they
didn't.
but
--
but
that
is
so
--
the
first
time
where
this
--
the
board
order
came
into
it
was
in
the
board's
decisions.
the
board
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
not
by
--
by
a
formal
motion,
(voice
overlap)
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
in
the
board's
opinion,
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
discuss
employees
of
any
other
employers.
they
just
say
that
the
supervisory
employees
were
interfered
with.
they
--
they
didn't
discuss
this
publicity
argument
or
they
did
not
mention
or
discuss
the
compromise
settlements.
there
was
nothing
in
the
board's
order
to
show
that
a
broad
order
was
justified.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
before
i
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
a
few
minutes
ago,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
filed
by
the
board
in
this
case
did
not
allege
any
factors
such
as
those
referred
to
by
mr.
manoli
as
--
that
is
a
history
of
violence
on
the
part
of
cwa,
a
planned
program
of
violence
on
the
part
of
cwa
or
any
internal
rule
that
was
being
adhered
to
--
to
in
the
balance
which
was
conducted
in
this
case.
neither
did
they
allege
that
the
employer
is
or
any
other
employer
except
ohio
consolidated
had
been
interfered
with.
to
the
contrary
of
the
complaint
specifically
was
restricted
to
interference
with
supervisory
employees
of
ohio
--
of
the
employer
that
is
of
ohio
consolidate.
the
labor
board
made
no
finding
that
anybody
other
than
supervisory
employees
of
ohio
consolidated
and
the
confidential
secretary
maynard
had
been
interfered
with.
there
was
no
mention
in
the
board's
decision
of
employees
or
any
other
employer.
mr.

r.
goldthwaite,

no
sir
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
by
the
general
counsel.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir.
i
don't
think
the
union
responded.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
that
time
but
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
the
trial
there
was
no
response.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
he
ruled
for
us
and
dismissed
the
case
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
there
was
no
request
in
the
general
counsel's
exception
as
to
the
trial
examiner's
report
for
a
broad
order.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
trial
examiner's
decision
which
was
in
its
favor
and
which
the
board
brushed
off
as
being
irrelevant,
the
fact
that
the
company
had
engaged
on
the
pattern
of
misconduct
which
brought
on
all
of
the
misconduct.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
it
brushed
off
the
company's
misconduct
judge.
board
just
says
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner
as
to
the
company's
misconduct
are
irrelevant
and
set
aside
these
conclusions.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
trial
examiner
found
specific
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
union,
but
excused
it
on
the
basis
that
the
company
incited
it
all
in
the
beginning.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
on
the
specific
findings
of
misconduct,
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir.
there
was
not
a
thing
said
in
this
in
this
--
in
this
whole
case
until
the
board's
order
came
down
about
the
employees
or
any
other
employer.
there's
not
a
thing
in
the
record
about
it
until
the
board's
order
came
down
and
the
board
in
its
decision
makes
no
findings
of
fact
which
were
sustained
in
that
broad
order.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
they
made
their
order
based
on
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner
that
they
were
about
12
instances
of
misconduct
directed
against
supervisors,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
real
grievance
is
that
(voice
overlap)
there
was
no
action
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
you
honor,
i
think
the
--
the
thing
that
would
hurt
us
is
the
fact
that
potentially
as
this
court
found
in
may
department
stores,
potentially
this
is
an
initial
proceeding
which
maybe
instituted
in
any
court,
i
mean
in
the
sixth
circuit
for
on
account
of
acts
which
occur
in
any
circuit
in
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
the
board
may
now,
on
the
basis
of
this
order,
go
into
the
sixth
circuit
and
ask
the
cwa
to
be
adjudicated
to
be
in
contempt
because
of
things
that
happened
in
california
or
maine
or
florida
or
anywhere
in
the
united
states
insofar
as
they
constitute
violations
of
section
8
(b)
(2)
(a).
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir.
it's
a
--
it's
a
substance
problem.
i
think
they
have
to
go
in
the
sixth
circuit
for
enforcement
of
contempt
proceedings
but
i'm
saying
that
they
can
extend
--
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sixth
circuit
throughout
the
united
states
in
other
unrelated
cases
which
ohio
consolidated
is
not
interested
in
it
where
other
local
unions
other
than
the
one
which
is
here
petitioner.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well
that's
what
this
court
said
in
may
department
stores
as
i
construed
it,
mr.
justice
black.
it
said
--
the
court
said
that
the
trail
of
contempt
proceedings
is
of
sufficient
weight
to
justify
anybody
except
into
the
breadth
of
a
board's
order.
and
based
on
--
if
in
this
case
mr.
justice
frankfurter
the
only
basis
of
responsibility
of
cwa
was
purely
derivative.
the
only
thing
that
they
were
held
responsible
for
was
because
they
were
the
bargaining
agent,
they
approved
the
strike,
they
did
not
cut
off
strike
benefits
when
this
violence
occurred,
and
they
made
bonds.
there
is
no
--
furnished
the
money
for
bonds.
there
was
no
showing
that
anybody
specifically
ratified
of
approved
on
behalf
of
cwa,
the
misconduct.
now
if
those
principles
of
vicarious
libel
responsibility
can
be
applied,
that
is
negative
principles
of
responsibility,
failure
to
take
any
action,
can
be
applied
to
whole
cwa
libel
in
this
case
they
certainly
could
be
applied
to
actions
occurring
on
--
done
by
any
law,
done
by
union
anywhere
in
the
united
state.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir.
i'm
just
saying
(voice
overlap)
we
complained
about
the
thing.
i
think
that
there
was
a
negative
vicarious
responsibility
at
least
we
did
not
bring
that
in
question,
yes
sir,
but
it
is
a
negative
one
which
could
be
applied
positively
in
contempt
proceedings
and
therein
is
our
grievance
in
as
much
as
the
board
didn't
find
any
history
on
the
part
of
cwa
in
adjudicated
cases
or
in
the
record
to
commit
violence,
found
no
planned
program,
found
no
internal
rule
that
was
adhering
to
in
the
violence.
we
submit
the
only
thing
that
they
could
have
done
was
adhere
to
what
is
the
prominent
obvious
policy
on
the
part
of
the
board
in
recent
cases
to
use
broad
orders
in
our
brief
we
set
up
12
cases
where
they're
precisely
the
same
language
or
any
other
employer
has
been
used
by
the
board.
there
are
two
more
which
we
do
not
cite,
which
are
very
recent
morrison-knudsen
company
versus
nlrb
ca9
and
decided
on
february
19th,
1960
and
nlrb
versus
carpenters
union,
ca7
decided
on
march
22nd,
1960.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
earliest
one
that
which
i
cite
mr.
chief
justices
1955
case.
there's
one
that
goes
back
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
falls
in
that
category
in
1953,
but
predominantly
there
in
recent
years,
14
cases
where
this
language
has
been
stricken
down
by
circuit
court
of
appeals
relying
on
this
court's
ruling
in
the
express
publishing
company
case
and
the
may
department
stores
case.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
they're
not
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart,
yes.
morrison-knudsen
versus
nlrb
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
k-n-u-d-s-e-n.
yes,
sir.
ca9
dated
2,
1960
45
l.r.r.m
2907.
nlrb
versus
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
2907.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir,
nlrb
versus
carpenters
union,
ca7
322,
60
45
l.r.r.m.
3014,
3014.
the
courts
in
those
cases
have
held
that
--
that
where
there
wasn't
--
where
there
was
no
showing
of
facts
in
the
record
or
on
past
conduct
of
a
planned
program
or
a
contempt
for
the
processes
of
the
board
that
the
--
that
language
based
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
too
broad,
and
we
submit
they
were
correct
and
urge
the
court
to
reverse.
thank
you
sir.
