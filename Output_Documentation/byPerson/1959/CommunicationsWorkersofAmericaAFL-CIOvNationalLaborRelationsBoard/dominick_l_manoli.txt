mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
the
labor
act
provides
that
whatever
the
board's
--
they'll
find
that
any
person
is
engaging
in
or
has
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practice
that
the
board
shall
issue
an
order
requiring
such
a
person
to
cease
and
desist
from
engaging
in
such
unfair
labor
practice.
this
court
has
held
that
the
statute
empowers
the
board
to
--
to
enjoin
not
only
the
particular
unfair
labor
practice
found
but
also
like
or
related
conduct
which
maybe
fairly
and
reasonably
be
anticipated
from
the
offender's
past
misconduct.
in
exercising
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
they
--
what
are
--
generally
over
the
years
your
honor,
had
been
--
one
that
had
been
in
--
directed
against
the
employer,
say,
an
who
has
discriminated
against
a
certain
employee
because
he
was
member
of
union
a.
the
board's
order
will
generally
read
that
will
enjoin
them
from
discriminating
against
the
employees
by
reason
of
its
membership
in
union
a
or
any
other
labor
organization.
now,
the
type
of
cases
that
this
court
has
had
from
the
labor
board,
one,
was
the
express
publishing
case.
and
there,
the
problem
was
whether
the
board's
finding
that
the
employer
had
failed
to
bargain
in
good
faith
justify
the
board
order
which
required
the
employer
from
in
any
other
manner
to
invade
the
rights
of
his
employees
under
the
statute.
and
the
court
their
held
that
the
--
any
--
that
the
refusal
to
bargain
did
not
sustain
anything
more
than
an
order
direct
through
the
employer
to
refrain
from
refusing
from
--
refusing
the
bargain
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
by
restriction.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir,
in
--
in
that
case
of
course
and
the
bargaining
order
would
be
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
with
respect
to
that
particular
union.
but
they
say
though
over
the
years,
we've
had
no
difficulty
on
this
score.
there
had
been
any
number
of
cases
where
the
board's
order
directed
against
the
employer
who
has
in
somewhere
other
infringed
the
right
of
some
employee
because
of
his
membership
in
a
particular
union.
the
board's
order
will
say,
refrain
from
interfering
or
restraining
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
or
they
exercise
their
right
to
belong
to
a
particular
union
or
any
other
labor
organization.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
we
think
analytically,
your
honor,
they're
the
same.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
i
will
address
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
will
continue.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
my
argument,
your
honor.
the
--
this
court
has
also
said
that
in
exercising
the
power
to
restrain
unfair
labor
practice
which
the
statute
vest
in
the
board.
that
the
board
shall
look
to
the
particular
case
and
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
words
that
he
shall
make
an
informed
judgment
as
to
the
extent
to
which
a
particular
violator
should
be
fenced
in.
now,
the
board
in
this
case
concluded
that
effectuation
of
the
statutory
policies
were
required
that
the
petition
should
be
enjoined
from
restraining
and
coercing
not
only
the
employees
of
ohio
consolidated,
the
immediate
employer
involved
in
this
case,
but
also
the
employees
of
any
other
employer
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
under
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true.
there
is
no
--
there
os
no
limitation
upon
the
board's
order.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
both.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
--
the
order
has
significance
particularly
for
the
international.
that
is
true.
now
the
board
in
making
in
making
--
arriving
it
as
conclusion,
did
not
specify
the
reasons
for
its
order.
but
presumably,
it
must
have
concluded
that
the
record
warranted
such
an
order
and
i
think
that
when
--
that
the
record
does
support
--
does
give
support
to
our
view
and
while
the
board
may
have
come
close
to
the
edge,
it
did
not
over
step
the
permissible
limits
of
its
discretion
in
this
area.
now,
i'll
probably
need
that
--
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
a
reviewing
court
considering
the
matter
de
novo
would
have
made
a
similar
judgment.
i
believe
that
the
issue
is
whether
the
board
has
acted
within
the
perimeter
of
its
--
of
its
admittedly,
of
its
admittedly
broad
discretion
in
this
area
or
whether
it
strayed
so
far
from
that
perimeter
that
a
reviewing
court
cannot
permit
its
judgment
to
stand.
now,
in
order
to
make
that
assessment,
i
should
like
to
focus
attention
very
briefly
upon
the
illegal
activity
in
which
petitioners
engaged
in
and
the
implications
of
that
misconduct.
as
counsel
for
petitioner
has
stated,
the
unfair
labor
practice
here
occurred
during
the
course
of
a
rather
protracted
strike
against
the
ohio
consolidated
company.
the
--
beginning
shortly
after
the
commencement
of
the
strike
and
extending
over
a
period
of
three
months,
the
agents
of
the
petitioners
engaged
on
at
least
12
separate
occasions
in
coercive
acts
against
company
personnel
who
were
seeking
to
carry
on
its
business,
its
functions
during
the
term
of
the
strike.
these
coercive
tactics
included
not
only
violence
--
not
only
threats
of
violence
but
also
actual
violence.
on
various
occasions,
union
agents
followed
the
company
personnel
to
their
homes
in
an
effort
to
intimidate
them.
they
also
prevented
access
as
well
invest
and
egress
to
and
from
the
company
premises
to
employed
company
personnel
who
were
seeking
to
perform
services
and
also
to
make
deliveries.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
conduct,
your
honor
was
carried
on
by
so-called
strike
directors
and
picket
captains
and
the
trial
examiner
for
the
board
found
and
the
board
agreed
with
him
and
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
this
misconduct
was
part
of
a
joint
effort
upon
the
part
of
the
international
and
the
local.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
when
the
court
arose,
i
had
summarized
briefly
the
misconduct
which
constituted
the
basis
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
found
here
by
the
board.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
asked
the
question
as
to
the
basis,
i
believe,
of
the
liability
of
the
international
for
the
particular
acts
of
misconduct
and
the
trial
examiner
in
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
misconduct
here,
your
honor,
the
record
shows
was
largely
engaged
in
by
people
who
belong
to
the
local,
to
the
local
affiliated
with
the
international.
the
international's
connection
with
this
rests
upon
a
number
of
things:
one,
the
fact
the
international
is
part
of
the
contract
which
had
expired,
that
the
strike
was
called
here
by
the
international
as
well
as
the
local
in
support
of
their
new
contract
demands.
secondly,
that
the
international
had
supported
the
strike,
paid
strike
benefits,
furnished
bail
to
the
strikers,
furnished
bails
to
the
strikers
who
had
engaged
in
misconduct
and
there's
some
showing
that
they
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
record
does
not
show
your
honor
that
any
officer
any
officer
the
international
participated
in
the
misconduct
in
this
case.
and
there
is
--
there
is,
as
i
say,
the
record
show
that
the
misconduct
was
engaged
in
by
people
who
were
connected
with
the
local
and
the
international's
responsibility
rests
upon
the
factors
that
i've
indicated
although
as
i
say,
the
record
does
not
show
that
any
official
of
the
international
actually
participated
or
that
there
is
any
showing
that
there
was
any
overt
instigation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
indeed
it
is
your
honor
because
as
i
--
i
will
address
myself
to
some
of
the
fears
that
had
been
expressed
by
the
other
side,
and
i
think
the
question
that
you
ask
underlies
those
fears.
now
the
board
found
that
these
tactics
that
were
engaged
in
by
the
petitioners
constituted
restraining
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and
the
board's
order
is
couched
in
the
language
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
which
makes
it
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
or
its
agents
to
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
act.
now
the
board's
order
to
begin
with
complies
literally
with
the
command
of
the
statute,
namely,
that
the
board
shall
enjoin
the
commission
of
such
unfair
labor
practices
found
here
to
restrain
and
coercion
of
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
under
--
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
statute.
but
more
important,
i
think,
the
nature
of
the
misconduct
lends
support
to
the
breadth
of
the
--
to
the
board's
order.
the
court
would
have
noted
that
the
misconduct
here
was
directed
not
only
against
the
employee
and
employees
personnel
against
personnel
and
the
immediate
employee
of
ohio
consolidated
but
the
results
are
directed
particularly
and
especially
against
personnel
which
ohio
consolidated
had
recruited
from
the
affiliated
enterprises,
affiliated
(inaudible)
companies
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
its
operations
during
the
strike.
in
fact
it
was
the
advent
of
these
outsiders
that
precipitated
in
large
part
the
misconduct
in
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir,
it
is
not.
it
is
not.
but
i
think
that
the
implications
of
this
conduct
i
would
try
to
bring
out
do
support
the
breadth
of
the
board's
order.
now
these
--
these
outsiders
--
these
outsiders
were
regarded
by
the
petitioners
as
strikebreakers
and
it's
particularly
reprehensible
because
they
had
taken
over
their
jobs.
now
the
coercive
tactics
in
this
case
were
not
due
to
any
unique
or
special
circumstances
peculiar
to
this
case.
we
think
--
we
think
that
they
evidence
a
purpose
on
the
part
of
petitioners
to
intimidate
anyone
whether
or
not
in
the
immediate
employee
or
the
consolidate
company
to
intimidate
anyone
who's
sought
to
perform
services
for
the
company
during
the
strike
and
thereby
impair
the
effectiveness
of
their
strike.
and
undoubtedly,
even
though
the
court
did
not
--
the
board
did
not
specifically
address
itself
to
the
--
to
this
problem,
this
must
have
been
one
of
the
factors
which
weighed
with
the
board,
which
weighed
with
the
board
in
concluding
that
the
protection
of
its
order
should
extent
not
only
to
the
employees
of
ohio
consolidated
but
also
to
the
employees
of
other
employers.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor
a
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
give
a
general
answer
to
that
because
the
board's
orders
depend
pretty
largely,
of
course,
upon
the
special
facts
of
the
case,
but
there
are
orders
--
there
are
orders
of
the
board
in
various
types
of
cases
where
it
--
the
protection
of
the
order
extends
beyond,
beyond
the
employees
of
the
immediate
employer
or
beyond
even
the
geographical
jurisdiction
of
the
particular
local
or
labor
organization
that
maybe
involved
and
perhaps
i
can
answer
your
question
your
honor
best
in
the
words
of
the
board
itself.
unhappily,
unfortunately
we
didn't
cite
this
case
in
our
brief
and
i'd
like
to
cite
it
now.
it's
at
110,
nlrb,
287,
and
the
union
involved
there
was
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
110
nlrb,
287.
this
case
came
down
in
1954
but
i
think
that
what
the
board
said
then
is
as
true
--
is
also
true
of
its
orders
today.
the
board
had
been
stressing
itself
to
this
problem
of
the
breadth
of
its
orders
and
after
citing
this
court
decision
and
express
publishing
company,
the
board
then
generalized
its
order
–
(inaudible)
generalized
concerning
his
orders
in
this
language.
the
board
said,
“rely
upon
this
test,
namely,
the
express
publishing
test
of
like
or
related
conduct,
relying
upon
this
test,
the
board
has
with
judicial
approval
extended
geographically
that
coverage
of
cease-and-desist
orders
to
protect
the
employees
of
employers
other
that
those
a
party
to
the
proceeding
where
the
respondent
unions
had
committed
similar
violations
against
other
and
unrelated
employers
or
planned
a
program
or
had
a
planned
program
to
apply
the
same
techniques
to
the
operations
of
other
employers
or
had
committed
the
unlawful
acts
during
a
general
organization
campaign
in
which
such
acts
were
typical.
however,
the
board
has
also
issued
such
orders
in
several
recent
cases
in
which
they
have
heard
to
be
no
evidence
that
the
respondent
unions
had
committed
similar
unfair
labor
practices
against
employers
other
than
those
involved
in
the
proceeding.
in
most
of
these
cases
the
unlawful
conduct
occurs
as
a
result
of
respondents'
adherence
to
trade
rules
constitutions
and
by
laws
or
agreements
which
conduct
by
reason
did
they
expected
it
be
continued
against
other
persons
unless
enjoined.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no,
your
honor.
it
says
cease
and
desist
from
restraining
of
coercion
the
employees
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
no
discussion
of
this
in
this
decision,
in
the
board's
decision,
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
board
did
discuss
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
instant
case,
but
i
think
that
what
i
have
reported
from
its
decision
in
the
110
nlrb
pretty
much
generalizes
what
the
board's
position
has
been
with
respect
to
these
orders.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
your
honor
the
board
rejected
the
trial
examiner's
conclusion
on
the
ground.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
on
the
ground
--
on
the
ground
that
the
union
had
engaged
in
a
conduct
in
misconduct
which
had
not
been
--
which
had
not
been
provoked
--
provoked
by
the
company's
--
by
the
company's
own
misconduct
and
then
if
the
union
--
if
the
company
had
engaged
in
such
misconduct,
then
there
was
relief
open
to
the
union,
namely,
to
file
a
charge
with
the
board
and
have
that
process
in
the
usual
fashion.
however,
that
we
have
this
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
were
number
of
instances
on
which
the
board
of
misconduct
or
a
violence,
let
me
say,
or
threats
on
which
the
board
did
not
rely,
the
board
excluded
those
from
its
consideration
because
in
those
particular
instances
apparently
the
record
show
--
the
record
shows
that
there
had
been
some
provocation
on
the
part
of
company-employees
that
led
to
the
particular
misconduct
in
those
particular
instances.
but
the
instances,
there
are
dozen
instances
on
which
the
board
relied,
there
is
no
showing
there
that
there
was
any
provocation,
any
provocation
on
the
part
of
the
company
personnel.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
--
well
the
record
clearly
shows
that
your
honor.
as
i
say
by
necessary
inference
the
board
must
have
found
that
because
the
board
specifically
did
not
rely
upon
a
number
of
instances
set
forth
in
the
trial
examiner's
report
in
which
there
had
been
--
there
was
some
evidence
of
provocation
upon
the
part
of
the
company's
employee
and
personnel.
now,
as
i
said
the
misconduct
here
or
the
petitioner's
evidence
as
a
purpose
to
intimidate
anyone
whether
or
not
in
the
regular
employee
of
ohio
consolidated
was
sought
to
perform
services
for
the
company
during
the
strike.
but
beyond
this,
we
also
think
that
the
evidence
is
a
purpose
upon
the
part
of
the
union
to
engage
in
like
conduct
whenever
it
caused
a
strike
against
any
employer.
that
makes
fine
(inaudible)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
largely
of
the
--
of
the
international,
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
you
see
the
membership
of
the
cwa,
it
is
confined
to
the
employees
of
the
ohio
consolidate
company
into
portsmouth,
ohio
area.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
local
will
have
little
or
no
case
and
to
operate
outside
of
that
geographical
jurisdiction.
and
therefore
as
a
practical
matter
the
order
of
the
board
insofar
as
it
applies
to
the
local
really
applies
to
it
only
within
this
limited
geographical
area
and
petitioners
have
indicated
they
have
no
quarrel
with
an
order
that
so
limits
it.
but
the
international,
the
cwa
however
as
petitioners
pointed
out,
does
operate
under
nationwide
scale.
it
represents
employees
all
over
the
country
and
it
deals
with
numerous
employers.
now
it
was
the
cwa
which
called
the
strike
in
this
case.
and
the
misconduct,
the
misconduct
was
part
of
a
joint
effort
upon
the
part
of
the
cwa
and
the
local
in
order
to
ensure
the
effectiveness
of
this
strike.
now
the
record
--
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
record
that
given
a
similar
situation
involving
another
--
involving
another
employer,
a
strike
situation
involving
another
employer
that
the
cwa
but
not
engage
in
similar
conduct
in
order
to
ensure
the
effectiveness
of
a
strike
there.
certainly
this
danger
we
think
is
not
so
remote
nor
so
improbable
that
the
board
cannot
of
proper
be
safeguard
against
it.
now
it
is
common
practice
in
the
telephone
industry
whenever
one
company
is
in
difficulty
of
one
kind
or
another
to
recruit
--
to
recruit
personnel
from
affiliated
concerns.
now
it
was
the
recruitment
of
personnel
from
sister
companies
that
as
i've
said
precipitated
in
large
measure
the
misconduct
in
this
case.
in
this
particular
case,
these
outsiders
were
regarded
as
the
strike
breakers,
and
is
there
any
reason
to
suppose
that
the
attitude
of
the
cwa
in
the
situ
--
or
the
attitude
or
the
conduct
of
the
cwa
the
international
here
in
a
strike
situation
involving
either
ohio
consolidated
or
any
other
employer,
is
there
any
reason
suppose
that
its
attitude
would
be
any
different
who
respected
these
outsiders
that
are
brought
in
to
continue
the
operations
of
the
affected
employer.
now
we
say
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
record
shows
your
honor
that
the
salaries
of
these
people
were
paid
by
ohio
consolidated,
but
i
may
also
add
that
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
unions
did
not
know
anything
at
all
but
the
time
they
were
engaging
in
this
misconduct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
i
think
your
honor
it
evidences
a
purpose
as
i've
sought
to
suggest.
it
evidences
a
purpose
of
this
that
the
union
here
will
seek
to
intimidate
anyone,
anyone
whether
or
not
an
immediate
employee
of
this
company
who
seeks
to
perform
services
for
a
struck
employer,
and
thereby
lessen
the
effectiveness
of
the
strike.
that
i
think
is
what
the
sort
of
conduct
evidences.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
places
where
the
--
the
people
who
were
engaged
in
this
misconduct
explained
it
on
the
ground
that
these
people
were
outsiders
that
they
were
taken
over
their
jobs.
we
have
set
that
forth
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
your
honor,
of
course,
the
rank
and
file
employees
of
the
company
had
gone
out
on
strike
and
the
only
ones
that
were
left
performing
services
for
the
company
were
largely
its
own
supervisors,
its
own
supervisors,
and
these
outside
supervisors
from
affiliated
concerns.
now
as
i've
said
as
i've
said
for
the
most
part
the
misconduct
it
was
directed
against
these
outsiders
who
were
regarded
as,
may
i
say,
as
reprehensible
strike
breakers
taken
over
the
jobs
of
the
--
of
the
striking
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
only
thing
that
i'm
trying
to
suggest,
your
honor
is,
this
these
evidences
--
this
evidences
and
i
would
believe
that
this
is
the
rationale
of
the
board's
order
that
this
evidence
is
a
purpose
--
a
purpose
to
extent
this
kind
of
misconduct
to
anybody
to
all
employees
--
to
all
employees
and
that
is
the
basis
why
the
board
has
extended
this
order
beyond
the
needy
employers
of
ohio
consolidated
because
it
must
have
felt
concluded
and
say
so,
it
must
have
concluded
that
the
unions
conduct
to
hear
evidence
to
purpose
to
intimidate
any
employees
of
any
employer
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
who
were
seeking
to
perform
services
during
a
strike
called
by
this
particular
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
i
think
the
case,
your
honor
poses
might
be
a
more
favorable
thing
for
me
to
be
having
here
than
the
instant
one
that
--
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh
i
think
the
case
that
you
suggest
your
honor
is
stronger
than
two
cases
i
must
be
--
i
must
say
(voice
overlap)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
they
come
from
--
from
other
employers
who
had
no
connection
whatsoever
with
this
company.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
i
don't
know
what
the
board
would
have
done
with
the
case
of
that
kind.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
the
board
might
draw
the
inference
that
this
was
a
kind
of
strike
activity,
the
kind
of
picketing
activity
that
would
not
be
confined
to
this
particular
strike
and
to
this
particular
employer.
that
the
board
might
draw
the
inference
to
say
this
was
the
kind,
the
kind
of
activity
directed
against
so-called
scabs.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
analytically
no.
no.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
legally
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
legally,
my
answer
is
that
the
board
could
appropriately
find
in
that
situation
that
the
kind
of
an
order
that
was
necessary
was
one
that
would
protect
the
employees
of
any
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
your
honor,
i'm
just
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
not
easy
to
answer
that
question
by
yes
or
no
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
because
largely
the
kind
of
an
order
that
you
entered
in
this
case
depends
upon
the
particular
circumstance
of
the
particular
case
and
that
this
is
why
i
hesitate
to
make
a
categorical
yes
or
no
answer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
company
did
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
that's
right
and
we
think
that
the
evidence
here
gives
a
basis
for
interfering
inference
that
given
a
strike
situation
against
other
employers
whether
or
not
ohio
consolidated
that
the
union
here
would
engage
in
similar
activity
against
employees
who
continue
to
perform
services
and
who
would
be
regarded
by
the
unions
in
the
parlance
of
the
--
of
the
labor
organizations
a
scabs.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
you
honor,
i
do
not
know
what
kind
of
an
order
the
board
would
have
entered
in
the
case
that
you
suggest.
that's
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
understand
sir.
that's
the
best
answer
i
can
make.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
i
do
know
--
i
do
know
that
there
are
cases
of
the
board
where
there's
been
--
where
the
union
has
engaged
upon
misconduct
not
upon
some
outsiders
but
against
the
employees
who'd
refused
to
go
out
on
strike,
who
refused
to
go
out
on
strike
and
remained
at
strike,
and
the
strikers
have
engaged
in
misconduct
against
those
employees.
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
board
would
enter
a
broad
order
like
it
did
here
and
did
reason
for
it.
the
reason
for
it
is
because
this
kind
of
conduct
up
in
the
strike
and
during
a
strike
on
the
picket
line
is
not
atypical
you
might
say
with
strike
situations.
very
often,
you
will
find
unions
that
will
engage
in
misconduct
against
people
that
they
regard
as
scabs
and
strikebreakers.
now
as
i
say
i
don't
know
the
particular
situation
that
your
honor
suggests
where
the
board
would
enter
order
of
this
kind
of
an
act.
i
know
that
the
board
has
but
it's
largely
dependent
of
course
upon
the
particular
flavor
of
that
record.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
i've
made
the
best
answer
i
could.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
before
i
close
i
think
my
time
is
coming
to
--
to
an
end.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
some
of
the
fears
that
have
been
expressed
by
the
other
side
in
connection
with
these
orders.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
in
order
of
this
kind
exposes
the
international
to
concept
--
contempt
sanctions
for
misconduct
in
the
part
of
any
of
its
local
conduct
which
the
international
may
have
neither
authorized
nor
have
been
able
to
prevent.
i
believe
that
these
fears
are
not
really
well
founded.
in
the
first
place
--
in
the
first
place,
the
cwa,
the
international
cannot
be
held
accountable,
legal
responsible
for
the
acts
of
its
local
except
upon
traditional
common
law
principles
of
agency.
it
must
be
shown
that
the
cwa
has
authorized,
instigated,
participated,
or
supported
such
misconduct
in
the
part
of
its
locals
and
secondly
as
the
cases
make
quite
clear
in
order
to
get
in
the
contempt
adjudication,
there
must
be
this
showing,
the
showing
of
such
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
international
must
be
made
by
clear
and
convincing
proof.
now
in
these
circumstances,
i
think
that
the
fears
they
say
which
have
been
expressed
by
the
cwa
are
not
really
well
founded.
finally,
there's
been
some
concern
expressed,
expressed
that
an
order
of
this
kind
tends
to
shift
the
primary
responsibility
for
administering
the
statute
from
the
board
to
the
courts
and
that,
the
courts
of
appeals
would
be
called
upon
to
make
initial
determinations
of
fact
and
perhaps
even
on
the
law
and
this
is
an
undesirable
development.
now
we
think
that
this
contingency
to
some
extent
is
on
aboard
and
in
any
event,
we
think
that
it
is
minimal.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
potential
danger.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
broad
order
your
honor,
you
mean
to
--
the
part
of
the
order
it
says
the
employees
of
any
other
employer.
well
your
honor,
i
have
suggested
that
the
cwa
will
not
--
cannot
be
held
accountable
for
the
misconduct
of
any
of
its
locals
with
respect
to
the
employees
of
any
other
employer
except
upon
a
showing
on
--
on
the
basis
of
common
law
agency
principles
that
it
is
responsible
for
that
misconduct
and
those
principles
require
that
the
cwa
as
should
have
required
show
it.
and
in
the
contempt
proceedings
a
showing
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
not
mere
by
preponderance
but
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
as
the
cases
say
there
is
showing
that
it
has
instigated,
participated,
or
supported
such
conduct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
now
addressing
my
--
continuing
where
this
other
phase
of
the
argument
that
this
kind
of
an
order
tends
to
shift
the
primary
responsibility
from
the
board
to
the
courts
and
contempt
proceedings
as
i've
indicated
i
will
end
it
just
a
moment
you
honor.
as
i've
indicated,
we
think
that
this
is
unavoidable
and
in
any
grant,
it's
minimal.
these
orders
can
only
be
enforced
to
the
contempt
sanctions
and
in
enforcing
them
through
contempt
sanctions,
courts
must
necessarily
make
findings
of
fact
and
they
may
even
be
called
to
make
findings
of
law,
but
in
any
event,
this
is
minimal
because
the
exclusive
part
to
institute
contempt
proceedings
is
in
the
board
and
the
board
before
invoking
the
contempt
proceed
--
before
instituting
contempt
proceedings
does
make
the
initial
determination
of
fact
and
of
law.
thank
you.
