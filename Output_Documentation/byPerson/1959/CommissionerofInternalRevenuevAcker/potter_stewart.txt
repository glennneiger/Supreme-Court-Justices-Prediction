well
--
perhaps
not
on
this
very
section
that
there
is
a
provision,
is
there
not,
that
provides
as
follows,
if
my
tax
last
year
amounted
to
$500,
even
if
my
tax
this
year
is
going
to
amount
to
$40,000,
if
i
filed
a
declaration
based
on
last
year's
estimate,
i'm
completely
insulated
from
this
penalty
or
this
interest,
i'm
i
not?

(voice

definition.
but
this
--
this
is
also
true
even
if
i
--
it's
irrelevant
even
--
that
--
that
i
had
knowledge
that
this
year
my
tax
was
going
to
be
$40,000,
is
it
not?
it's
to
the
--
after
the
government
to
show
that
even.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
part
of
my
question
only
went
to
your
argument
that
this
amounts
to
interest,
because
under
my
supposititious
case,
i
could
knowingly
be
withholding
$38,500
of
money
due
the
government
for
a
substantial
portion
--
period
of
time
and
--
and
be
liable
for
no
interest
whatsoever,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
definition
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the,
in
that
connection,
what
--
well,
i'm
asking
this
for
information
on
page
30
of
your
brief,
this
statute
is
set
out
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
--
i'm
interested
in
the
meaning
of
the
sentence
beginning
toward
the
top
of
that
page,
â€œfor
the
purposes
of
this
subparagraph,
the
amount
and
due
date
of
each
installment
shall
be
the
same
as
if
the
declaration
had
been
filed
within
the
time
prescribed,
showing
an
estimated
tax
equal
to
the
correct
tax
reduced
by
the
credit
under
sections
32
and
35.
and
this
is
in
the
statute
relating
to
failure
to
file
any
declaration
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
yes,
on
the
top
--
toward
the
top
of
page
30.
justice
potter
stewart
it
had
been
withheld?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
troubled
or
what
interested
me
about
this
language
was
the
fact
that
it
was
contained
in
that
part
of
the
statute
which
relates
the
failure
to
file
any
declaration.
and
it
says
that
for
certain
purposes,
it
will
be
assumed
that
this
--
the
result
will
be
the
same
as
though
a
declaration
had
been
filed.
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally,
under
that
code
this
problem
doesn't
arise?
