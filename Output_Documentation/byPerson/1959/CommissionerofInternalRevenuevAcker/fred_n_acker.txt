mr.
fred
n.
acker
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please.
i
would
first
address
myself
a
little
out
of
order.
justice
stewart
asked
a
question
where
a
man
had
a
return
or
an
income
of
$2500
in
a
certain
year
and
the
following
year
he
had
$50,000.
under
the
law
as
it
is
enforced
now,
there
would
be
no
penalty.
now,
if
i
understand
correctly
and
i'm
willing
to
be
corrected
on
the
proposition,
because
the
statute
requiring
a
declaration
involved
a
prophecy,
that
is
a
main
at
the
beginning
of
the
economic
year,
had
to
prophesy
two
things.
he
had
to
prophesy
what
his
taxable
income
would
be
and
that
involved
a
double
guess,
it
involved
a
guess
by
him
as
to
what
his
income
would
be
and
it
also
involved
a
much
more
difficult
guess
as
to
what
the
tax
rate
would
be
when
congress
got
around
to
enacting
the
tax
for
that
particular
year.
therefore,
the
courts
in
interpreting
this
provision,
this
reasonableness
provision
ignored
the
expressed
wording
of
the
statute
and
they
said
that,
“we,
as
a
court,
won't
construe
any
man
who
does
that
as
having
complied
with
the
statute.”
in
other
words,
this
was
a
case
where
the
statute
itself
was
so
extreme
that
the
court
by
a
long
series
of
decisions
avoided
or
voided
the
effect
of
this
statute
in
that
situation.
and
finally,
after
they
magnified
and
buildup
and
multiplied,
i
think
the
commissioner
then
said,
“that
we
will
accept
that
definition
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
history
of
that
situation.”
now,
i
want
to
go
to
a
point
that
counsel
was
making
his
very
last
point
that
he
made.
and
he
was
saying
there
that
there
would
be
a
situation
in
which
a
man
could
be
in
complete
default
and
he
wouldn't
pay
any
penalty
and
that
situation
grows
about
in
this
situation.
the
man
files
no
return
at
all,
that
is
no
estimate.
and
therefore,
strictly
speaking,
he
should
pay
a
10%
penalty.
but
if
he
could
show
that
that
was
reasonable,
he
would
escape
that
penalty.
then
we
come
to
the
second
provision,
the
so-called
6%
provision
and
since
he
had
filed
no
estimate
and
since
it's
very
difficult
to
underestimate
something
that
he
didn't
file
at
all,
that
you
can't
file
an
estimate
and
not
file
at
--
you
cannot
file
an
estimate
and
file
an
estimate
that's
an
understatement
at
one
of
the
same
time,
this
man
would
be
excused
from
the
6%
penalty
under
my
definition.
now,
counsel
says
that
that
is
an
ambiguity,
but
in
that
he
airs,
“because
that
is
not
an
ambiguity,
it
is
an
omission
by
the
drafter
of
the
act.”
it's
some
omission
to
cover
it.
it's
not
an
ambiguity,
it's
an
omission.
and
of
course,
you
can't
create
a
liability,
because
the
drafter
of
the
act
created
an
omission.
so
he
calls
it
by
the
wrong
name.
he
didn't
cover
all
of
the
possible
situations
that
could
exist.
and
therefore,
what
he's
complaining
about
is
not
an
ambiguity,
he
is
complaining
about
an
omission.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
then
my
answer
would
be,
your
honor,
is
this.
that
congress
would
find
itself
in
the
very
irrational
proposition
of
having
two
penalties
for
one
and
the
same
thing.
and
one
of
them
would
be
10%
and
the
other
one
would
be
6%,
and
with
all
due
deference
that
sometimes
congress
does
do
things
that
are
irrational,
i
don't
think
that
they
would
do
a
thing
so
completely
irrational
as
that.
in
any
event,
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
it
does
not
unless
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute.
now,
we
--
we
get
down
to
--
mr.
fred
n.
acker
yes,
they
can,
up
to
a
point
--
up
to
a
point.
but
since
they
didn't
say
it,
we
don't
need
to
--
mr.
fred
n.
acker
in
the
conference
report,
there
is
such
language,
your
honor.
now,
let's
get
down
to
the
essence
of
this
case.
here,
we
have
an
exceedingly
simple
statute,
an
abstract
legal
question.
and
we
have
a
requirement
on
the
income
tax
law
that
said,
“that
you
must
file
a
declaration
and
they
created
two
kinds
of
penalties,
just
two
kinds
of
penalties
for
two
possible
situations.”
the
man
who
says,
“i
will
make
no
report”
and
the
other
man
who
makes
a
faulty
report.
and
judging
the
weight
of
those
two
defaults,
they'd
say
for
the
major
default
which
is
in
defiance
of
the
law
itself,
we'll
make
it
10,
but
the
man
who
does
it
just
badly,
we
will
make
it
6.
now,
if
you
will
read
the
statute,
i
defy
anyone
to
get
any
other
conclusion
out
of
it
or
any
other
possibility.
the
wording
is
plain,
it
is
unmistakable,
it
is
--
i
go
so
far
is
to
say,
it
is
inescapable.
and
therefore,
i
say,
your
honor,
there
can
be
no
resort
either
to
the
conference
report
or
to
the
regulations
because
there
is,
in
fact,
no
ambiguity
and
the
entire
brief,
some
27
pages
or
some
34
pages
of
the
government's
brief,
turns
entirely
around
the
proposition
that
there
is
an
ambiguity.
but
they
fail
in
any
respect
to
point
out
what
the
ambiguity
is.
what
is
the
ambiguity?
where
is
the
ambiguity?
there
might
be
an
--
an
omission
in
a
very
extraordinary
situation,
but
there
is
no
ambiguity.
and
therefore,
if
i
understand
the
law
of
the
land
as
interpreted
by
this
court
and
by
all
of
the
state
courts'
interpreting
statutes,
if
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
itself,
if
we
can
get
it
from
the
four
corners
of
the
statute,
then
we
have
no
resort
either
the
conference
reports
or
the
regulations
of
any
kind
and
that
is
the
essence.
and
therefore,
this
court
after
examining
the
expressed
language
of
that
statute,
before
it
could
begin
to
examine
the
conference
report,
or
to
examine
the
regulations,
or
to
examine
any
of
--
of
the
arguments,
would've
first
have
to
find
that
there
was
in
truth
and
in
fact,
an
ambiguity.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
all
i
am
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
n.
acker
pardon.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
i
have
a
double
answer
for
that,
your
honor,
or
i
think
i
have
a
double
answer
for
it.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
yes.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
now
--
mr.
fred
n.
acker
--
if
that
was
--
if
it
was
in
the
conference
report
and
therefore
in
the
mind
of
the
congress
that
they
wanted
to
do
that,
that
they
wanted
to
create
a
liability,
a
second
liability,
they
would
have
said
so,
they
would
have
said
so,
if
that
was
the
mind
of
the
congress.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
its
authority
statement
is
only
in
the
statute.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
but,
your
honor,
while
every
enactment
is
the
result
of
a
give
and
take
theoretically
on
the
floor
of
congress
or
in
the
committee,
its
final
conclusion
can
only
be
construed
from
the
statute
itself,
if
the
statute
is
plain
and
unambiguous.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
well
now,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
rules
of
congress.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
and,
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
that
the
fact
that
you
don't
find
language
in
the
statute,
you
can
construe
either
way.
you
can
construe
that
they
therefore
understood
it
in
the
light
that
the
government
now
contends
for
or
that
you
can
construe
it
in
the
light
that
they
intended
to
avoid
that
conclusion
by
the
omission
of
it.
in
other
words,
that's
an
argument
that
can
work
both
ways.
you
can
work
that
argument
both
ways
either
way.
it's
just
as
logical
to
argue.
one
conclusion
as
it
is
to
argue
the
other
conclusion.
and
secondly,
i
--
i'm
a
little
bit
puzzled
when
it
comes
to
holding
and
what
congress
did
or
didn't
do
when
--
when
or
what
their
thought
was,
when
you
regard
the
internal
revenue
act
which
is
a
--
a
document
of
about
900
pages.
and
i
am
sure
there
isn't
a
congressman
--
there
isn't
any
congressman
or
any
senator
that
understands
what's
in
it.
he
got
a
general
conception
--
mr.
fred
n.
acker
oh,
no.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
but
when
you
are
trying
to
reach
in
--
have
been
searching
to
the
mind
of
what
the
congress
was,
you
have
to
pay
some
attention
to
the
type
of
an
enactment
that
it
was,
when
you
have
a
single
statute
or
a
simplified
statute
that's
one
thing.
but
when
you
have
a
large
comprehensive
statute,
which
even
the
internal
revenue
department
doesn't
understand,
then
you
got
a
definite
situation.
now,
they
make
another
contention
that
the
enactment
has
stood
there
and
that
is
that
--
their
interpretation
has
stood
there,
all
of
these
intervening
years
and
of
course
it
has
stood
there
in
these
intervening
years,
but
not
without
controversy.
now,
they
contend
that
since
congress
has
let
it
there,
that
we
should
interpret
it
in
the
light
that
the
government
has
interpreted
it.
but
there
is
another
doctrine
of
the
law
that
follows
along
that,
that
the
congress
pays
attention
to
what
the
courts
are
deciding
on
the
same
subject,
so
we
have
parent
--
parent
thoughts
that
are
running
along
parallel
one
to
another.
and
of
course,
if
that
is
true,
if
the
congress
pays
attention
to
that,
they
will
find
that
the
tax
court
was
making
decisions
more
or
less
supporting
the
government's
contention
while
the
district
courts
were
not
doing
it.
and
it
is
only
recently
that
it
has
got
into
the
circuits.
so
that
i
don't
see
how
you
can
come
to
any
conclusion
that
might
go
to
another
proposition
that
the
internal
revenue
act
is
a
very
hot
subject.
and
congress
is
constantly
saying
we
will
--
we
will
examine,
we
will
examine
it,
but
they
don't.
at
least
they
do
not
go
into
it
in
the
very
thoroughgoing
manner
and
next
november
5th,
theoretically
for
about
the
eighth
or
ninth
time,
we
are
supposed
to
have
a
further
thoroughgoing
revision
or
study
of
the
internal
revenue
act.
but
we'll
have
to
see
how
thorough
that
is,
but
you
can't
give
any
great
conclusion
from
that.
now,
let's
go
to
the
cases.
well,
when
this
first
came
up,
i
made
a
very
thorough
digest
of
the
cases
and
what
did
i
find?
i
found
out
that
there
was
absolutely
no
meaning
in
any
of
the
cases.
in
other
words,
the
cases
were
about
something
else.
they
were
about
fraud.
they
were
about
technicalities.
they
were
about
bookkeeping.
and
then
at
the
very
end
of
the
decision,
the
court
would
say,
“10%
penalty
inflicted,
6%
penalty
inflicted.”
no
meaning,
no
explanation,
no
reason
why.
and
to
show
you
that
that
is
so
even
in
the
decisions,
let's
take
the
sixth
circuit.
the
sixth
circuit
on
three
occasions,
sustained
the
double
penalty,
the
10%
and
6%,
and
then
reversed
themselves
in
the
instant
case.
so
this
was
called
to
there
attention
in
the
patchen
case,
which
was
decided
after
the
instant
case.
so
the
court
took
a
look
why
they
did
this
and
they
looked
at
the
records
and
they
found
out
that
it
was
in
the
pleadings,
but
not
in
the
briefs
and
counsel
didn't
argue
it,
so
as
a
matter
of
course.
and
therefore,
that
means
nothing.
now,
let's
get
down
to
the
instant
case.
the
government
attacks,
be
it
767%
in
one
year,
83%
in
another
and
i
was
objecting.
and
the
government's
contention
was
that
they
had
a
right
to
tax
even
though
it
was
confiscatory,
even
though
it
was
destructive,
even
though
it
was
excessive.
now,
that
is
a
quotation
not
from
me.
they
were
--
are
not
words
that
i
pulled
out,
but
they
were
the
substance
of
the
government's
brief.
and
they
were
adopted
by
the
tax
court.
and
when
the
thing
was
argued
in
the
circuit
court,
they
repeated
that
contention.
mr.
fred
n.
acker
and
--
mr.
fred
n.
acker
if
the
court
please,
i
was
--
at
the
recess
i
was
taking
what
i
thought
was
the
very
extravagant
claim
of
the
government
as
to
their
right
to
tax
and
i
was
countering
that
with
the
famous
statement
that
the
power
to
tax
is
not
the
power
to
confiscate,
and
several
other
things
that
are
associated
with
that
which
i
think
this
court
is
familiar
with
and
therefore
i
will
not
digress
to
go
into
that.
the
question
of
the
penalties
was
not
even
argued.
it
was
not
even
mentioned
so
far
as
the
oral
argument
was
concerned
and
in
the
briefs,
i
think
it
was
given
three
or
four
lines
and
i
was
greatly
amazed
when
the
opinion
was
handed
down
that
the
court
spent
an
extravagant
amount
of
time
almost
in
discussing
this
subject.
i
suppose
their
reason
for
this
was
that
while
they
had
agreed
with
me
in
principle
in
unmistakable
language
that
the
power
of
the
government
to
tax
was
not
as
extravagant
as
they
claimed
it
was
not
as
great
as
they
claimed,
they
gave
no
relief
on
that
subject.
and
i
thought
a
leap,
or
in
a
summersault
that
was
greater
than
any
leap
since
brodie
jumped
off
the
brooklyn
bridge,
but
they
did
though
to
a
great
extent
to
eluciate
a
little--
elucidate
the
--
their
reasons
for
being
with
the
respondent
in
that
action.
now
on
the
affirmative
side
of
my
case
as
to
how
i
would
interpret
the
statute,
i
think
immediately
upon
reading
it
after
looking
at
the
context
of
it
and
format
of
the
statute
and
the
way
it
is
set
up
and
it
provides
one
penalty
for
not
doing
a
thing
and
another
penalty
for
not
doing
a
thing,
but
we
have
the
classic
interpretation,
the
express
mention
of
one
thing
is
the
exclusion
of
another.
now
if
there
was
ever
a
classic
principle
of
interpretation
for
statutes
or
for
anything
for
that
matter,
it
is
that
great
principle.
in
other
words
where
one
thing
is
expressly
mentioned
that
is
conclusive
and
not
only
do
we
need
to
go
to
that
most
apparent
and
evident
principle
of
interpretation,
but
we
can
--
we
can
almost
go
to
mathematics
and
in
using
the
word
mathematics,
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
that
that
is
a
branch
of
philosophy.
in
other
words,
the
whole
includes
all
of
the
parts.
so
when
i
fail
to
do
one
thing,
it
already
included
all
of
the
parts.
now
it
seems
to
me
this
is
so
evident
and
so
apparent
on
logic
that
i
stand
amazed
that
anyone
should
be
contending
to
the
contrary.
now
the
government's
counsel
had
said
something
about
the
history
of
this
case
and
he
thought
from
the
history
of
the
case,
they
should
be
sustained.
well
now
the
very
fact
that
it
was
constantly
changed
during
these
intervening
years,
the
1943
and
on
itself
indicates
that
there
was
a
freedom
out
of
trouble
with
this
and
when
the
congress'
got
to
1954,
our
present
revenue
act,
they
eliminated
it
entirely
which
shows
the
type
of
public
opinion
that
was
operating
at
that
instance.
now
therefore,
i
want
to
resume
and

i
therefore
think
on
the
constructive
side
that
the
ordinary
principles

to
show
that

was
no
ambiguity
if
you
will
read
the

plainly
and
unmistakably,
there

a
single
ambiguity
in

an
omission

cannot
supply
an
omission.

something
that
was
overlooked
(inaudible).
