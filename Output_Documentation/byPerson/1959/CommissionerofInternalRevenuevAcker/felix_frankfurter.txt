mr.
spritzer,
may
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
what
the
setting
of
that
sentence
in
the
reports
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it
was
directed
towards
i
think,
to
the
enforcing
provision
that
was
part
of
the
elucidation
of
the
enforcing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
congress
had
put
that
census
that
mr.
spritzer
quoted
on
top
of
page
20,
into
the
act
itself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
question
is
whether
the
definition
in
the
report
has
in
the
illegal
significance
to
a
definition
or
in
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
congress
and
they
don't
see,
will
say
now,
we
can
use
this
place
and
the
statute
living
in
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix

needed
a
report,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
go
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me.
you
have
to
establish
that
a
conference
report
as
waiting
a
report
and
any
i
believe,
much
more
waiting
for
me
than
an
individual
--
report
of
an
individual
committee
of
either
house,
that
a
conference
report
can't
write
a
definition
of
that
which
without
it,
would
be
unambiguous
your
way.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
it
would
be
unambiguous
your
way
without
the
conference
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
you
saying
that
a
conference
report
which
says,
we
mean
by
underestimated
that
if
nothing
is
given
at
zero
and
therefore,
whatever
beyond
that
is
the
range
of
underestimation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
be
very
hospitable
to
--
to
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
--
justice
felix

(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
you
would
solve
a
--
you
take
a
lot
of
difficulties
out
of
or
wait
for
me
--
to
tell
me
how
i
can
find
out
the
mind
of
congress
except
to
the
expression
of
its
authoritative
organs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
this
court
has
go
on
way
beyond
that.
that
--
that
would
be
a
perfect
argument
in
england.
we
said
that
reports
--
above
all
reports
(inaudible)
by
authoritative
spokesman
on
the
floor
of
either
house
and
report
and
i
say
especially
a
conference
report
is
a
gloss
and
the
only
authoritative
expression
of
mind
that
i
know,
is
what
those
who
are
authorized
to
speak
to
congress
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
the
conference
report
has
to
be
adopted
by
each
house?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
--
evidently,
there
were
differences
and
they
then
each
--
the
conference
committee
submitted
this
report
to
each
house
and
they
have
to
act
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
ought
to
throw
out
the
whole
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
we
got
no
mind
of
congress
--
we
got
no
mind
of
congress.
