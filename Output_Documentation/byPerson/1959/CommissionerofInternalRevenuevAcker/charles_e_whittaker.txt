justice

whittaker
mr.
spritzer,
it's
not
true
that
an
entirely
--
section

(d)
(2)
alone,
there
could
be
no
means
of
confusing
the
amount
--
the
addition
for
the
amount
would
not
be
ascertained,
upon
which
the
computation
should
be
made.
and
in
order
therefore
to
make
the
computation,
you
have
to
look
to
the
regulation
which
fixes
the
estimate,
when
none
was
filed
at
zero.
and
is
it
not
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
because
of
that
fact,
it
is
not
the
statute,
but
the
regulation
that
imposes
this
penalty.

the

starts
off
saying
at
80%
of
the
tax
in
the
case
of

the
estimated
tax,
there
shall
