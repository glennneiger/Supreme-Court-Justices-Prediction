mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
your
honors.
this
case
comes
here
from
the
sixth
circuit
and
involves
construction
of
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
shortly
after
the
decision
below
came
down,
the
identical
issue
came
before
three
other
courts
of
appeals
those
of
the
third,
fifth
and
ninth
circuits
and
all
three
of
those
courts
have
expressly
disagreed
with
the
result
which
was
reached
in
the
instant
case.
and
presumably
to
resolve
that
conflict,
this
court
granted
the
writ.
the
issue
is
a
narrow
one
and
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
simple
and
i
take
it
undisputed.
for
the
years
1947
through
1940,
respondent
taxpayer,
who
incidentally
is
an
attorney,
failed
to
file
a
declaration
or
estimate,
as
it
is
sometimes
called,
of
income
tax,
pursuant
to
the
now
familiar
requirements
under
our
scheme
of
pay-as-you-go
income
taxation.
this
failure
to
file
the
declaration
was
willful
and
without
any
reasonable
cause
or
excuse
in
the
statutory
sense.
there
are
specific
findings
as
to
that
by
both
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
at
record
8
and
16,
respectively.
i
pause
to
mention
in
fairness
to
taxpayer
that
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
reason
for
the
failure
to
file
the
declaration
was
a
tax
evasion
or
a
fraudulent
motive,
rather
it
appears
from
this
and
from
other
cases
as
well
in
which
the
taxpayer
has
been
involved,
that
the
reason
for
non-filing
was
a
desire
to
bring
a
test
case
in
which
taxpayer
might
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
income
tax
laws
in
their
present
form.
in
any
event,
taxpayer
was
liable
for
taxes
in
fairly
--
in
substantial
amounts
in
each
of
the
years
involved.
and
the
question
here
is
simply
what
additions,
what
additions
to
tax
were
properly
imposed
by
the
commissioner
by
virtue
of
the
taxpayer's
delinquency
in
the
respect
i've
indicated.
the
government's
position,
which,
as
i
say,
has
the
support
of
three
circuits
and
the
tax
court,
is
that
respondent
was
liable
under
the
statutory
scheme
for
two
distinct
additions
to
tax
in
each
of
the
years
involved.
whereas,
taxpayer's
position,
which
was
adopted
below
and
has
also
been
followed
by
a
number
of
district
courts,
is
that
the
statutes
permit
but
a
single
addition
each
year.
and
that
brings
me,
of
course,
to
the
statutory
provisions
themselves
and
to
the
pertinent
treasury
regulation.
they
are
set
out
in
our
brief
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
not
as
such.
the
question
is
whether
the
6%
and
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
top
of
the
10%,
yes.
i
think
to
give
the
scheme,
i
--
i
need
to
indicate
the
various
addition
provisions
though
only
one
of
them
is
here
in
dispute.
those
provisions
are
set
out
beginning
at
page
29
of
the
government's
brief.
the
first
one
in
point,
section
294
(d)
(1)
(a)
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
29
under
the
caption,
“failure
to
file
declaration,”
that
provision
provides
in
substance
that
if
there
is
no
filing
of
the
declaration
unless
such
non-filing
is
excused
by
reasonable
cause,
there
shall
be
added
to
the
tax
5%
of
the
amount
due,
but
unpaid.
and
then
the
provision
goes
on
to
state
that
each
additional
month
of
that
delinquency
continues,
there
shall
be
an
additional
1%,
but
not
to
exceed
an
aggregate
of
more
than
10%.
and
that
provision
i
shall
refer
to
as
the
10%
penalty
provision.
i
used
the
term
penalty
because
this
addition
is
intended
to
apply
as
the
statute
says.
only
where
there
is
fault
where
there
is
lack
of
excuse
a
--
a
willful
or
defiant
failure
to
file
the
declaration
and
also
of
course,
because
the
10%
figure
is
itself,
obviously
a
--
a
penalty
kind
of
figure.
it
has
not
been
an
ordinary
interest
charge.
subparagraph
(b),
which
immediately
follows
on
page
30,
is
not
involved
in
this
case
as
such,
but
perhaps
calls
for
a
brief
word
to
give
the
full
picture.
and
it
provides
in
substance,
that
if
a
declaration
of
estimated
tax
has
been
filed,
unlike
the
situation
here.
if
one
has
been
filed,
but
the
installments
thereunder
have
not
been
paid
in
accordance
with
the
declaration,
that
once
again
additions
which
may
aggregate
10%
maybe
imposed.
here
again,
the
breach
of
duty
is
excused,
if
it's
shown
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
for
the
non-payment.
and
this
provision
is
of
course,
alternative
to
(a).
this
applies
when
there's
a
declaration
and
no
payment
thereunder.
(a)
covers
the
situation
where
there
has
been
no
declaration.
i
come
now,
then
to
the
third
addition
provision
which
is
set
forth
in
a
separate
section.
this
is
294
(d)
(2),
which
is
captioned,
“substantial
underestimate
of
estimated
tax.”
and
it
is
the
application
of
this
provision
which
--
which
gives
rise
to
the
exact
dispute
that
we
have
here.
as
the
caption
indicates,
this
deals
with
the
situation
where
there
has
been
a
substantial
understatement
in
the
declaration
or
a
“substantial
underestimate”.
a
--
an
underestimate
incidentally,
is
deemed
substantial
under
this
statute,
if
the
final
tax
as
figured
at
the
end
of
the
year,
exceeds
by
more
than
20%,
the
amount
which
the
taxpayer
has
estimated.
now,
if
there
is
such
an
understatement,
the
statute
provides
that
there
is
to
be
added
to
the
tax
6%
of
the
difference
between
the
final
tax
and
the
estimate.
in
short,
if
a
taxpayer's
final
tax
liability
of
$1000
and
he
has
estimated
$800,
he
has
satisfied
the
provision.
if
he
estimated
$500,
the
provision
would
call
for
an
addition
of
6%
of
the
difference
between
$500
and
$1000.
now
this
addition,
as
we
view
it,
is
in
the
nature
of
an
interest
charge,
though
it
is
designated
like
the
other,
an
addition
to
tax.
the
important
consideration
to
note
here,
i
think,
is
that
this
provision
applies
irrespective
of
whether
there
is
fault
or
no
fault.
there's
no
provision
in
--
in
this
section
for
excusing
the
addition
to
tax.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
your
honor.
but
that
is
not
a
--
the
answer
to
the
reason
that
is
so,
is
because
that
is
not
a
substantial
understatement
as
defined
in
the
tax
effect.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
this
--
the
provision
to
which
your
honor
refers
is
designed
to
give
taxpayers
who
find
difficulty
in
estimating.
a
means
of
meeting
the
requirement
and
if
they
estimate
last
year's
tax,
they
have
satisfied
for
purposes
of
this
addition
provision
statute.
similarly,
a
taxpayer
can
elect
to
file
an
estimate
every
three
months
on
the
basis
of
his
experience
for
that
quarter
of
the
year.
he
can
annualize
his
tax.
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
underestimate
as
defined
in
the
statute,
then
there
is
no
defense
of
reasonable
cause
or
over
side
or
mistake,
or
other
form
of
excuse.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
true
under
these
addition
provisions.
and
that
is
so
because
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
because
of
the
definition
and
because
congress
wanted
to
take
care
of
the
taxpayer
who
--
whose
business
was
such
that
he
had
special
difficulty
in
estimating.
i
think
if
in
fact,
a
taxpayer
can
estimate
and
he
knows
that
his
income
in
the
current
year
is
going
to
be
substantial
--
substantially
higher,
i
think
it's
questionable
whether
he
should
take
advantage
of
this
provision.
because
he
is
required
to
set
out
his
estimate
over
a
declaration
that
these
facts
are
true
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
and
belief
and
while
the
addition
provision
doesn't
apply
in
terms,
i
doubt
if
that
provision
is
intended
for
his
benefit.
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
stress
is
that
i
think
the
10%
provision
is
designed
to
deal
with
the
situation
where
there
has
been
a
specified
breach
of
a
particular
requirement
and
that
breach
has
been
knowing
and
willful.
hence,
it
applies
only
where
there
is
fault
for
willfulness.
whereas,
the
other
provision
is
apparently
designed
to
compensate
the
government
in
the
situation
where
has
not
received
a
reasonably
accurate
estimate
and
according
--
and
payments
in
accordance
therewith.
and
that
latter
provision
would
apply
to
a
taxpayer
who
perhaps
had
a
perfectly
good
excuse
for
not
filing
a
declaration.
the
6%
addition
would
apply.
similarly,
the
6%
addition
applies
to
the
taxpayer
who
has
filed
a
declaration,
but
one
which
is
inadequate,
even
though
there
was
no
willfulness
or
willful
neglect
in
making
the
inadequate
estimate.
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
at
this
point
to
the
regulation.
i
--
i
might
perhaps
say,
one
word
first.
the
taxpayer's
argument
is
essentially
this.
that
where
a
taxpayer
doesn't
file
a
declaration
or
estimate,
there
can
be
no
underestimate
--
having
been
no
estimate,
there
can
be
no
underestimate.
now,
the
--
the
regulation
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
you're
reading
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
the
32
and
35
refer
to
the
withholdings
and
other
credits
and
that
would
enter
into
the
base
to
which
this
10%
was
applied.
it's
--
it's
10
--
the
10%
has
to
be
applied
to
a
figure,
of
course,
the
correct
tax
figure
and
that
is
reduced
by
these
credits.
so
that
to
the
extent
there
has
been
a
withholding,
this
10%
penalty
would
not
take
hold
of
that
portion
of
the
taxpayer
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
and
the
tax
laws
and
other
portion
that's
been
withheld.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
and
that
is
done,
i
think,
to
take
care
of
the
problems
of
credits
and
withholdings,
and
to
bring
that
into
the
--
into
the
computation.
the
--
as
if
the
declaration
had
been
filed
that
it
comes
into
play
more
--
more
precisely
in
the
regulation
itself,
to
which
i
was
about
to
refer
the
court.
and
the
crucial
sentence
in
that
regulation
is
the
last
sentence
appearing
on
page
34,
“in
the
event
of
a
failure
to
file
the
required
declaration,
the
amount
of
the
estimated
tax
for
the
purposes
of
this
provision
is
zero.”
now,
this
regulation
was
adopted
in
1943,
very
promptly
after
congress
in
the
current
tax
payment
act
of
that
year,
adopted
the
scheme
of
pay-as-you-go
income
taxation.
it
remained
in
the
regulations
from
that
time
until
the
new
code
of
--
was
adopted
in
1954.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
does
not.
the
importance
of
this
case
such
as
it
has
is
that
there
are
several
thousand
cases
still
pending
under
the
1939
code.
i
referred
the
court
to
the
sentences
or
regulation
which
takes
care
of
this
case
precisely.
the
sixth
circuit
viewed
that
aspect
of
the
regulation
as
invalid.
it
said
that
it
didn't
consider
the
regulation
to
be
consistent
with
the
statute.
now,
we
urge
that
it
is
at
least
a
permissible
interpretation
of
this
statute
that
the
concept
of
substantial
underestimation
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
case
of
the
taxpayer
who
has
substantial
income,
but
fails
to
estimate
that
any
tax
at
all,
is
due.
and
the
three
other
circuits
which
have
passed
upon
the
question
have
said,
“the
statute
is
not
free
from
ambiguities.
that
it
is
necessary
and
proper
to
refer
to
the
history
and
to
the
consistent
administrative
practice.”
and
they
have
concluded
that
that
history
in
practice
compelled
the
conclusion
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
6%
addition
was
applicable
in
situations
where
no
estimate
was
filed
as
well
as
to
situations
where
an
inadequate
estimate
was
filed.
now,
in
that
premise,
let
me
refer
the
court
very
briefly
to
the
relevant
history
which
we
set
out
at
19
and
20,
of
our
brief.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
particularly
to
one
sentence
which
is
quoted
on
page
20
and
appears
in
both
the
house
committee
report
and
the
senate
committee
report
on
the
current
tax
payment
act.
and
that
sentence
is
this,
“in
the
event
of
a
failure
to
file
any
declaration
where
one
is
due,
the
amount
of
the
estimated
tax
for
the
purposes
of
this
provision,”
and
the
discussion
there
was
the
addition
for
substantial
under
estimation.
“for
purposes
of
this
provision,
will
be
zero.”
and
so,
we
have
a
case
here
in
which
the
treasury
regulation
was
adopted
verbatim
from
the
committee
reports
of
the
two
houses
of
congress.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
if
your
honor
will
go
back
to
page
19,
the
committee
reports
begin
with
the
quotation
toward
the
bottom
of
that
page.
these
paragraphs
contain
sanctions
relating
to
the
filing
of
declarations,
payments
of
installments
of
estimated
tax
and
to
the
proper
estimate
of
tax.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
after
saying
that
there
are
three
additions
to
tax,
the
committee
reports
have
a
brief
discussion
of
each
paragraph.
and
when
they
come
to
the
substantial
underestimate,
one
they
say
in
effect,
no
declaration
is
for
purposes
of
this
provision
tantamount
to
a
declaration
of
no
tax
due.
between
43,
when
this
provision
went
into
the
regulations
in
1954,
numerous
changes
we're
made
from
time
to
time
in
the
additions
provisions.
at
no
time,
was
there
any
disapproval
implied
or
otherwise,
of
the
treasury
regulation.
when
the
1954
code
was
adopted,
congress
made
a
change
which
does
away
with
this
problem
and
in
doing
so,
it
observed
and
we
quote
the
passage
on
page
23
of
their
brief,
“it
observed
that
under
the
1939
code,
the
charge
for
non-filing
and
the
charge
for
failure
to
file
a
declaration
or
paying
installment
of
estimated
tax
may
run
concurrently.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
now
a
single
addition
for
all
types
of
delinquency
in
connection
with
declarations
and
payments
thereunder.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
6%,
your
honor.
there
is
a
single
6%
whether
the
failure
is
non-fling
of
the
declaration,
inadequate
estimate
or
non-payment.
and
it
is
measured
from
each
quarter
what
the
new
law
provides
is
that
you
determine
what
the
correct
figure
is,
then
you
take
one-quarter
of
that
and
if
that
quarter
wasn't
paid
when
that
installment
was
due,
you
compute
six
--
you
add
6%,
measured
from
that
due
date.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
no
provision
for
a
concurrent
addition
of
any
kind
in
the
1954
code.
this
applies
strictly
to
cases
arising
under
the
1939
code.
congress
in
the
1954
code
continued
the
existing
provisions
in
effect,
until
a
specified
date
--
that
date,
until
january
1,
1955.
so
this
set
of
additions
--
the
set
of
additions
provided
for
in
the
1939
code,
must
be
applied
to
all
cases
up
to
all
tax
cases
arising
prior
to
january
1
of
1955.
i
would
like
to
point
out
by
two
examples
quite
briefly
that
this
isn't
the
case
of
two
additions
for
the
same
thing
depending
on
the
same
elements.
and
i
can
illustrate
that
by
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
10%
addition
applies
and
the
6%
does
not.
there
are
cases
in
which
the
6%
addition
applies
and
the
10%
does
not.
first
case,
suppose
that
a
taxpayer
fails
to
file
a
declaration
and
makes
no
payment
during
the
tax
year.if
this
was
the
result
of
a
mistake
or
passive
neglect,
the
failure
is
excused.
the
6%
addition
nonetheless,
applied
in
our
view.
indeed,
if
it
did
not
apply,
the
taxpayer
who
was
ignorant
of
the
filing
requirement
would
be
better
off
from
the
taxpayer
who
complied
with
the
filing
requirement,
but
submitted
in
estimate
that
was
too
low.
the
reverse
situation
is
covered
by
this
example.
x
again
fails
to
file
a
declaration.
however,
he's
a
salaried
employee
and
the
portion
of
his
pay
is
withheld
under
the
withholding
provisions
by
his
employer
each
week
and
transmitted
in
due
course
to
the
commissioner.
his
final
return
let
us
suppose
is
$1000
--
shows
a
correct
tax
of
$1000
and
withholdings
during
the
year
amounted
to
$800.
now,
in
that
event
there
is
no
6%
addition
to
tax,
because
there
has
been
no
substantial
underestimate,
because
under
section
294
(d)
(2)
credits
or
withholdings
are
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
there
has
been
a
substantial
understatement.
on
the
facts
i
gave,
the
withholdings
amounted
to
80%
of
the
ultimate
tax
liability,
hence
no
statutory
understatement.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
10%
provision?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
am
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
they
have
attempted
to
enforce
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
consistently
in
recent
years.
i
understand
that
in
the
early
years
when
the
scheme
was
a
novel
one,
that
there
was
very
little
effective
enforcement
of
these
additions
to
tax,
if
that
may
have
proceeded
from
a
billing
that
the
country
needed
a
certain
amount
of
time
to
accustom
itself
to
the
new
scheme.
but
apparently,
the
--
the
cases
didn't
begin
to
come
into
the
courts
until
some
years
after
pay-as-you-go
taxation
started.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
our
question
i
think
is
whether
a
filing
of
no
declaration
at
all
can
be
deemed
to
be
equivalent
to
an
estimate
of
no
tax
due.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
congress
used
the
term
in
the
statute,
substantial
understatement.
now,
i
think
it's
open
to
argument
whether
one
can
be
said
to
have
substantially
underestimated,
when
he
has
filed
nothing.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
but
i
don't
think
it's
foreclosed
--
that
were
foreclosed
from
determining
what
congress
meant
by
underestimate.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
has
a
man
who
has
filed
no
piece
of
paper
and
not
estimated
pay
zero
tax.
i
think
that's
certainly,
the
--
the
statute
doesn't
foreclose
that
interpretation.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
compels
it,
but
i
think
that
the
statute
is
at
least
sufficiently
ambiguous,
so
that
resort
maybe
held
to
legislative
history.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
committee
reports
of
both
houses,
which
contain
a
statement
which
shows
that
congress
necessarily
contemplated
that
the
non-filing
would
be
treated
as
a
declaration
of
zero.
those
are
the
very
words
that
both
houses
used.
we
have
combined
with
that
a
treasury
regulation
which
has
been
in
effect
from
the
beginning
of
pay-as-you-go
taxation
and
has
been
followed
for
11
years
until
the
code
has
been
revised,
a
--
a
more
concrete
and
persuasive
history
i
--
i
think
is
hard
to
find.
