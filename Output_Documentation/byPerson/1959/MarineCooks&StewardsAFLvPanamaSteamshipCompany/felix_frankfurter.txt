justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
told
us
about
the
nikolos?
have
you
told
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
ships
weren't
owned
by
hooker,
weren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
ships
weren't
owned
by
the
consignee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
consignee
was
out
of
this
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
seven,
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
substantive
tort
which
the
district
court
sought
the
remedy
by
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
mere
fact
that
they
--
the
mere
fact
of
picketing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
--
the
people
who
were
not
–
who
had
no
what
you
call
industrial
relation
to
the
ship
or
its
crew.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
had
--
but
(inaudible)
because
they,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
to
them
what
crew
was
used,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
even
if
you're
a
liberian
or
english
or
dutch
vessel
there
must
be
some
substantive
basis
for
interference,
the
substantive
basis
was
picketing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
against
the
use
of
non-american
crew,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
had
a
foreign
crew
and
displays
the
american
ship
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
an
american
crew.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
–
who
in
–
the
contract
affrieghtment
was
between
whom
and
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who,
in
other
words,
who
--
who
choose
this
liberian
carrier
instead
of
an
american
carrier
with
an
american
crew
subject
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
is
there
anything
in
any
american
legislation
that
prevented
that
choice
or
crowned
on
that
choice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
i
just
want
to
know
--
salt
of
this
--
clearly
on
which
the
injunction
was
sought,
any
--
any
consignee
in
new
york
can
select,
can
he
under
our
law
if
he
buys
stuff
from
abroad
or
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
he
can
book
space
on
whatever
ship
comes
his
way.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
the
injunction
was
in
the
statement
of
justice
brennan
that
they
wanted
--
they
were
hurt,
they
felt
injured
by
a
carrier
who
was
not
subject
to
the
(inaudible)
act
or
the
american
seamen's
act,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
don't
want
them
but
(inaudible).
when
you
say
substandard,
you
mean
just
by
hour,
even
on
extended?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
for
the
ship
itself
as
complying
with
the
laws
of
the
neglect,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
in
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
couldn't
--
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
with
this
if
this
wasn't
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
the
answer
--
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
depends
on
the
cons
--
it's
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
it
depends
on
the
construction
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
is
the
charter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
ultimately
the
question
as
indicated
i
was
intimated
by
justice
brennan's
question,
norris-laguardia
act
is
an
act
limiting
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
therefore
is
what
it
is
that
that
act
limits
that
court?
as
you
indicated
it
might
be
the
so
far
as
(inaudible)
is
concerned
it
is
that
people
in
front
of
them
have
enjoined
from
picketing
in
panama
or
anywhere
else,
couldn't
it?
i
mean
as
a
matter
of
physical
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
--
if
it
is
within
norris-laguardia
act,
that's
the
limitation
upon
every
district
court,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
haven't
any
--
you
needn't
worry
about
the
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
seen
the
government
brief.
they're
just
concerned
with
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they're
not
dealing
with
the
other
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
one
assume
that
this
–
prior
to
the
norris-laguardia
act,
this
could
have
been
enjoined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
doesn't
the
foreign
commerce
aspect
enter
into
what
would
have
been
enjoinable
prior
to
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
one
has
to
decide
possibly
come
to
norris-laguardia
as
i
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
romero
means
that
you
couldn't
have
entertain
it
on
any
side
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
got
–
that's
the
problem
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you're
full
of
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
railway
labor
act
cases
in
this
court
showed,
things
that
situation
maybe
within
the
kind
of
appropriate
analysis
that
you
made
of
the
language
and
yet
not
be
limited
by
it.
i'm
asking,
i
know
you
are
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
this
case
should
have
to
be
the
problem,
but
when
--
when
we're
in
the
realm
of
foreign
relations
when
i
think
--
think
about
them
and
the
--
the
country
of
--
of
the
national
of
the
charterer
might
the
law
of
the
country
of
the
national
--
the
charterer
might
require
him
to
charter,
to
employ
merely
citizens
of
the
country.
in
fact
as
we
--
we
strict
the
coast
by
straight,
wouldn't
there
be,
they
might
say,
i
mean,
i
know
what
country
this
charterer
was
a
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
foreign
corporation
might
be
required
by
the
law
of
the
country.
they
have
only
seamen
of
its
enactment
and
then
you
couldn't
say
well
we'll
have
a
controversy
between
the
charter
and
the
american
--
the
american
union.
you
could
possibly
--
you
could
--
you
could
be
ready
for
it.
it
would
be
a
little
odd
to
say
that
the
unions
can
have
a
labeled
controversy
with
the
law
of
the
country
of
the
charter
forbids.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no
but
you've
indicted
all
these
now,
can't
you,
because
a
lot
of
countries
have
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
legislations
that
we
have.
that's
true
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
liberian
law
did
what
it
did.
i'm
not
saying
it
is
good
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
a
lot
of
restrictive
--
they're
dealt
with
good
deal
of
restrictive
legislation
by
various
countries
to
require
internationals
to
deal
with
the
home
--
employ
the
home
market
as
it
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
it
is
not
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
no
typical
relation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
liberian
ships
coming
here
are
the
same
rights
that
our
ships
have
been
going
to
as
against
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
taft-hartley
act
did
not
--
the
taft-hartley
act
specifically
exempt
--
limits
or
provides
as
a
non
applicability
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
over
yet?
does
it
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they're
--
are
they
(inaudible)
in
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
the
law
who
didn't
always
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
like
argument
was
made
in
norris
--
in
the
norris
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
that
--
that
we're
not
enforcing
an
extraterritorial,
that
was
a
suit
brought
in
america
to
enforce
right
enforced
on
american
soil.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
this
is
that
case.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
that
decision
could
have
gone
the
other
way
that
are
doing
anything
except
enforcing
things
right
here
in
america
on
american
soil.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
the
large
legal
basis
that
the
consideration
that
we
impose
the
considerations
of
our
relation
with
the
foreign
countries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
(inaudible)
these
are
the
relevant
factors
that
one
has
to
consider
and
that's
one
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
might
say
to
you
one
is
troubled
by
the
fact,
you're
trying
to
prevent
(inaudible)
national
for
to
have
friendlier
relation
with
this
country
under
an
international
law
have
a
right
to
do
come
in
and
do
business,
you're
trying
to
prevent
them
from
coming
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
construing
that,
one
has
to
consider
the
implications
and
one
of
them
is
that
this
is
the
effective
way
of
preventing
vessel
of
making
the
(inaudible)
of
unfriendly
terms
from
coming
here
curtailing
their
rights,
limiting
their
rights,
otherwise,
you
wouldn't
want
the
injunction.
that's
why
you
want
the
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
same
thing
with
reference
to
different
situations
isn't
the
same
thing.
i
haven't
any
view
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
am
saying
is
one
would
see
problems
with
practical
problems
in
order
to
solve
them
adequately
and
it
does
make
a
difference
that
the
result
of
this
is
be
given
effective
remedy
against
nationals
of
friendly
nation
who
have
perfect
rights
to
be
--
have
a
perfect
right
to
send
ships
that
you
were
taking
measure
which
is
regarded
as
a
tort
and
the
question
is
what
remedy
should
we
availed
off
which
to
recognize
there
might
be
some
other
remedy,
what
remedy
maybe
availed
of
in
order
to
remedy
that
cause
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact
that
an
american
shipowner
can
get
a
remedy
and
the
injunction
doesn't
mean
there's
a
(inaudible)
norris-laguardia
act
must
read
seems
to
include
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
could
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
restriction
doesn't
follow
that
the
restrictions
upon
american
shipowner
from
that
that
it
follows
that
the
same
restriction
applies
to
a
foreign
shipowner,
it
doesn't
follow
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
saying
that's
right.
all
i'm
saying
is
the
fact
that
an
american
shipowner
couldn't
get
relief
by
injunction,
doesn't
follow
few
degrees
that
a
foreign
shipowner
fits
because
other
factors
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
three
judges
below
found
a
way
out.
there
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
go
there,
you
will
not
have
from
bigger
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
they're
right.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
no
logical
compulsion
in
the
words
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
it
must
be
applied
to
the
carrier
of
friendly
foreign
nation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
dispute
really
was,
mr.
jennings;
the
dispute
really
was
between
the
desire
of
the
american
union
not
to
have
a
complication
from
seamen
who
have
lower
standards
than
our
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
is
all
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
this
weren't
--
if
--
let's
forget,
for
the
moment,
the
foreign
relation
aspect
of
the
problem,
would
have
--
would
picketing
by
union
in
order
to
extend
a
membership
by
shutting
out
--
shutting
out
in
the
market
on
the
--
on
the
court,
let's
forget
the
foreign
aspect,
ships
that
carry
foreigners
and
therefore
not
members
of
the
american
union,
would
that
not
be
a
labor
dispute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
to
enlarge
--
or
to
enlarge
their
clientele
by
having
ships
that
--
with
crews
that
are
eligible
and
potentially
would
become
members
of
their
--
of
their
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
that
different
from
the
--
the
labor
dispute
which
seeks
to
enlarge
the
membership
of
the
union?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
for
these
people
because
they
can't
become
members,
they
can't
practically,
i
don't
know
about
legally,
practically,
become
bargaining
representatives
of
these
people
for
their
foreigners.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
want
to
--
if
--
if
foreign
carriers
with
foreign
crews
can't
come
into
the
port
of
seattle
or
whatever
it
is,
then
the
argument
is
that
their
hope
is
that
business
would
be
taken
over
by
american-run
ships.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
read
the
specific
definition
of
what
labor
dispute
is
in
the
norris-laguardia
act?
that's
what
the
case
must
turn
on
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
curious
to
know
why
you
did
that,
why
you
didn't
quote
from
the
norris-laguardia
act,
pure
curiosity
--
academic
curiosity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
your
quoting
both.
i
can't
quite
understand
your
partiality
to
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
the
proximate
relation
clause
means
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
quarrel
between
a
particular
employer
and
his
particular
employee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that's
so,
then
what
becomes
of
your
oral
argument
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
do
you
--
see
if
i
understand,
do
you
now
say
that
they
did
want
to
change
that
they
did
bring
themselves
within
the
terms
of
he
law
--
the
labor
dispute
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
on
that
page
of
the
problem?
suspending
for
the
moment,
whether
a
labor
dispute
with
reference
to
a
foreign
vessel
was
--
was
covered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy,
do
you
agree
that
this
was
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
if.
what
--
what
is
your
--
what
is
the
position
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
what
--
how
are
we
to
read
the
record
in
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
goes
--
the
burden
you
--
you
have
to
assume,
that
your
position
is
that
although
this
is
within
the
qualifications
of
what
is
or
what
is
a
labor
dispute
to
argue
in
this
case
has
not
been
imply
be
a
foreign
ship
is
withdrawn
from
the
scope
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
--
you
referred
two
or
three
times,
certainly
twice,
to
the
fact
that
whenever
congress
wanted
to
exercise
its
undoubted
power
to
touch,
to
deal
with
a
foreign
flag
vessel,
it
said
so,
explicitly,
have
you
collected
those
--
that
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
far
back
do
they
go,
does
that
--
type
of
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
--
in
thinking
and
in
having
a
notion
that
admiralty,
wholly
apart
from
legislation,
protected
seaman
in
certain
ways
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
matter
the
admiralty
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
that
body
of
--
if
i
may
use
a
contradiction
in
terms,
common
law
admiralty
law,
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
litigation
as
to
the
applicability
of
admiralty
to
foreign
ships
or
i
suppose
answer
my
question
since
those
--
since
those
admiralty
law
--
lawmakers,
judge-made
rules
were
based
on
the
generality
of
admiralty
law,
they
probably
would
be
a
world-wide
application,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
country
of
the
flag.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
mosser.
i
think
mr.
jennings,
though
may
misinterpret
him,
but
i
got
the
impression
that
he
was
not
show
whether
relief
could
be
held
even
by
way
of
injunction
in
a
state
court.
it
all
events
whether
i'm
right
or
not
as
to
what
he
said.
what
do
you
say,
could
the
relief
he
had?
the
reason
i
ask
you
this,
there
was
real
abuses,
which
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
derived
from
the
abuses
of
issuing
injunctions
in
the
federal

a
reason
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
there
were
hardly
--
there
were
few
cases
in
which
the
court
had
jurisdiction
as
such
in
the
federal
courts,
in
the
debs
case,
of
course,
where
they
strike
an
example.
but
on
the
whole,
in
the
main
overwhelming
mischief
that
was
complained
of
and
that
was
felt
in
rightly
--
as
i
believe,
was
that
the
adversity

got
into

jurisdiction
and
that
led
to
this
injunction.
and
that
embroil
the
federal
court
in

in
none
--
so-called
federal
litigation
in
issuing
injunction.
now,
do
you
think,
in
this
case,
have
you
any
viewers
to
whether
this
litigation
could
have
been
begun?
the
test
could've
been
successfully
pursued
in
the
state
court?
justice

meaning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
apart
from
--
is
it
the
admiralty
tort?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
you
can
--
justice

frankfurter
putting
the
romero
case
aside
for
a
moment,
so
you're
in
the
federal
court
because
this
is
an
admiralty
jurisdiction
statute?
let's
suspend
the

question
of

trade

why

did
you
answer

deal

with
the

justice

(voice

certainly
it
dealt
with
it.
justice

but
the
whole
question
of
whether
admiralty
commits

canvassed
alone,
wasn't
it?
justice

could
not

can

pope
say
since
admiralty
can't
issue
an

this
isn't
admiralty
ergo
it
is
law

justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
he
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
really
sought
--
was
injunction
against
the
maritime
tort,
which
is
judge
pope.
relief
of
that
character
is
wholly
unknown
to
an
admiralty

this
was
not
a
case
in
respect
to
which
a
federal
admiralty
court
--
courts
have
been
completely
adequate
to
entrust
to
protecting
maritime
rights,

it
in
federal
law.
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

well,
i
know,
but
therefore
he
says
romero
doesn't
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
doesn't
apply
because
he
says
that
admiralty
can't
issue
an
injunction
justice

and
what
is
the
starting
point
of
the
right
under
a
treaty,
the

i'm
worried

as

justice

you

i'm

i'm

you
get
the
whole
force
of

question.
if
we
determine

if

determines
this
is
a
limitation
upon
the
courts
not
to
issue
an
injunction

labor

on
the

act
applies
to
this,
we
don't
have
to
bother
what
the
nature
of
the
suit
is,
don't
we?
justice

do
you
have
the
question?
justice
felix

if
they
remanded
the
litigation
as
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
we
have
here
--
justice

that
--
justice

but
isn't
that
true?
isn't
that
all
there
is
before
us
now?
justice

the
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
your
answer
to
justice
black
is,
yes,
then
isn't
it?
if
norris
laguardia
limits
the
court
in
--
as
to
this
litigation,
it's
an
end
of
it,
so
far
as
we're
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

wouldn't
the
normal
thing,
in
this
case,
be
to
deal
with
that
problem
of
jurisdiction
which
is
conclusive
no
matter
what?
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
conclusive
no
matter
what,
why
bother
whether
it
refers
to
find
that
we
have
jurisdiction
on
some
other
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
--
[laughter]
it
--
it
maybe
conclusive.
yes,
but
if
--
if
norris-laguardia
does
apply,
then
it
must
be
conclusive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
don't
have
through

--
justice

yes.
justice

with

what
was
involved

mr.

was
the

justice

the
question

whether

and
they
held
not.
justice

mr.
jennings,
don't
you
think
we
have
enough
problems
on
this
case
without
getting
into
that?
justice

tangled
territory
of
the
criminal
liability
with
regard
to
ships?
justice

yes,
i
appreciate
all
the
information,
but
i
just
wonder
when
you
thought
we
have
to
decide
that
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
may
i
ask
you
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
your
position
that
this
isn't
within
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
admiralty
is
incapacitated
from
granting
the
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
didn't
--
and
my
question
was
whether
--
because
admiralty
--
it
isn't
within
admiralty.
of
course,
one
starts
that
there
must
be
a
substantive
offense.
the
injunction
is
a
remedy,
but
you
say
assuming
it
is
an
admiralty
clause,
start
with
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
why
is
it
not
admiralty
because
admiralty
can't
issue
an
injunction,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
yes,
it
is
an
admiralty
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
since
admiralty
can't
issue
an
injunction,
admiralty
has
no
power
in
the
premises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
since
it
is
admiralty,
although
it
can't
accord
relief,
you
can't
go
on
the
law
of
equity
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
that
everything
as
to
which
no
injunction
could
be
issued
is
protected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that,
but
i
don't
see
what
the
relevance
of
the
limitation
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
has
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
your
answer
to
chief
justice
warren
that
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
applies,
then
it's
protected.
is
that
--
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
because
you
can't
get
an
injunction
in
the
federal
court.
justice

all
right.
