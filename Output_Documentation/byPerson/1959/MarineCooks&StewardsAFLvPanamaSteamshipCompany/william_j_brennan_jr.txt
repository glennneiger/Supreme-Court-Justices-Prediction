that

it

well
let
me
â€“
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

maybe
this
may
lead
to
something
but
this
is
not
the
protection
(inaudible).
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
scheme
is
not
related
to
the

of
the

the

(inaudible)

well
does

(inaudible)

other
we
(inaudible)

william
j.

in
the
1959
amendment
carried
that
forward
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
be
more
specifically.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
they
sought
an
american
court
remedy
in
the
state
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
point.
and
unless
there's
something
which
gives
them
a
status
different
from
an
american
properly
speaking
the
same
relief
in
american
court
to
the
same
extent
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
apply,
that's
your
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
and
there
was
a
history
in
the
jones
act
which
supported
the
conclusion
that
it
didn't
cover
foreign
seaman
anyway,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
trying
to
prevent
their
resort
to
our
courts
on
any
different
terms
than
american
corporations
do
resort
to
our
courts
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
say,
mr.
jennings,
if
this
had
been
a
ship
of
american
registration
and
you
had
precisely
this
dispute,
would
you
make
any
different
argument
than
you
are
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
and
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
district
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
make
this
quite
a
bit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
suggest,
mr.
mosser,
this
might
be
savings
clause
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
injunction
such
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
mosser.
is
there
another
article
besides
article
15
upon
which
you
rely
in
this
--
making
this
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
article
15
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

why
do
we
