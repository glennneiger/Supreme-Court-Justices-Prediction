well
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
who
own
the
stock
in
this
company
that
owned
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
was
this
diagram
that
appears
in
the
end
one
of
the
briefs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
a
company
that
had
a
company
in
new
york
that
owns
the
ships
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
owned
a
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
picketed
that
company
in
new
york
and
had
the
same
information
on
their
picket,
would
the
norris-laguardia
act
have
barred
the
issuance
of
an
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
even
if
they
have
picketed
the
companies
that
owned
the
corporation
that
owned
the
ship,
that
--
that
they
could've
done
the
--
an
injunction
despite
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought,
they
were
frequently
disputes
between
officers
and
stockholders
of
companies
and
the
man
sometimes
by
their
picketing,
because
of
their
interest
in
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
it's
not
domestic?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
united
fruit
company,
to
get
a
dispute
with
the
united
fruit
company
here,
in
connection
with
some
of
its
work
in
south
america,
do
you
mean
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
allow
that
united
fruit
company
to
get
an
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
basis
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
understood
from
the
passage
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
that
many
people
thought
that
it
was
doing
an
injury
to
courts
to
issue
an
injunction
to
the
--
such
controversial
field.
as
far
as
that
reason
was
concerned,
if
it
is
about
that
reason,
is
to
be
no
difference
between
foreign
ship
controversy
and
the
domestic
one
when
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
i
should
--
myself
was
given
the
opposite
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
said
several
times,
this
is
the
maritime
tort.
do
we
have
to
face
on
that
to
determine
the
principal
jurisdiction
on
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
the
--
the
question
i
asked
was
whether
we
have
to
think
about
that
at
all
in
connection
with
determining
whether
this
--
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
can't
get
to
it,
can
you,
unless
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
bargained.
you
never
have
to
--
we
have
that
reset
