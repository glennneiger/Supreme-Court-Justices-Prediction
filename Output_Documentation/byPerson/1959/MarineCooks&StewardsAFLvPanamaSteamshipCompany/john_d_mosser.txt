mr.
john
d.
mosser
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
respondents
here
is
that
there
is
no
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
so
as
to
deprive
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
interlocutory
injunction
which
it
did
issue.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
at
the
outset
that
the
basis
upon
which
we
make
that
contention
is
that
the
dispute
was
over
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
a
board
of
foreign
flag
vessel,
only
transiently
in
a
united
states
court.
it
is
not
a
claim
of
special
position
for
a
foreign
shipowner
and
some
of
the
colloquy
particularly
between
counsel
and
mr.
justice
brennan
yesterday,
seemed
to
me
to
be
turning
on
the
question
of
a
foreign
shipowner
in
an
american
court.
i'd
like
to
point
out
the
difference
between
the
owner
of
a
foreign
ship
and
a
foreign
shipowner.
one
looks
to
the
corporate
owner,
the
other
looks
to
the
ship.
it
might
well
be
that
you
would
have
an
american
owner
of
a
foreign
flag
vessel
and
we
believe
that
such
an
american
owner
in
court
would
be
entitled
to
the
same
relief
here
as
these
respondents
are.
it
is
not
the
position
as
a
foreign
shipowner,
but
as
the
owner
of
a
foreign
ship
which
centers
around
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
labor
dispute
because
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
aboard
that
ship.
now,
there
is
some
question
as
--
in
my
mind
as
to
just
what
the
petitioners
are
claiming
the
labor
dispute
here
is.
in
response
to
a
question
for
mr.
justice
whittaker
yesterday,
counsel
stated
that
there
was
no
dispute
with
the
crew
members.
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
5,
the
statement
is
made
in
the
first
full
sentence
at
the
top
of
the
page
after
the
quotation.
the
petitioners
in
picketing
were
not
seeking
to
change
wages,
hours
or
working
conditions
on
the
s.
s.
nikolos.
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
chief
justice
yesterday,
counsel
said
that
it
would
make
no
difference
so
far
as
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
concerned,
if
the
wages
here
were
not
far
below
the
american
standar,
which
their
members
have
aboard
competing
american
flagships.
in
fact,
the
position
that
counsel
took
yesterday
was
that
they
were
here
seeking
to
shut
this
foreign
flag
vessel
out
of
this
trade.
now,
as
counsel
admitted
in
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
believe
not,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
that
if
they
are
seeking
to
represent
the
crew
or
to
bargain
with
the
owner
over
wages,
hours
or
working
conditions.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
if
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
if
they
were
seeking
to
enlarge
the
membership
of
the
union,
if
they
were
seeking
to
become
the
agent
for
these
people
and
to
have
them
join
the
union
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
then
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
labor
dispute,
your
honor,
anymore
than,
let
me
put
this
example.
the
railroads
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
business
away.
in
fact,
the
intercoastal
american
trade
has
practically
dried
up.
now,
suppose
this
union
were
to
go
out
and
picket
the
railroad
with
the
intent
of
stopping
the
railroad
from
loading
all
intercoastal
--
all
transcontinental
cargo,
in
order
that
american
ships
would
have
more
business
so
that
their
members
would
have
more
jobs,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that.
and,
i
think,
your
honor
is
correct
that
it
is
the
statute
that
we
are
here
construing
that
the
problem
is
to
determine
just
what
that
definition
is.
now,
the
term,
“labor
dispute,”
this
--
it's
found
in
29
u.s.c
113
(c)
and
at
page
40
of
our
brief,
we
have
quoted
the
definition
from
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947.
the
two
definitions
are
identical
except
for
one
small
word
which
i
will
point
out
in
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
was
comparing
this
case
at
that
point,
your
honor,
to
the
benz
decision
of
this
court
which
was
rendered
three
years
ago
and
in
which
the
court
held
the
taft-hartley
act
was
not
enacted
with
any
eye
to
foreign
labor
relations
or
disputes
over
employment
conditions
aboard
a
foreign
flag
vessel.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
barely
to
say
if
--
that
the
argument
i
make
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
is
that
the
sections
are
identical
except
for
one
word
and
i
quote
the
different
word.
the
definition
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
is,
"the
term,
labor
dispute,
includes
any
controversy
concerning
terms
or
conditions
of
employment
or
concerning
the
association
or
representation
of
persons
in
negotiating,
fixing,
maintaining,
changing
or
seeking
to
arrange
terms
or
conditions
of
employment
regardless
of
whether
the
dispute
stand
in
approximate
relation
of
employer
and
employee."
now,
the
only
difference
between
the
two
acts
is
that
the
labor
management
relations
act,
instead
of
saying
terms
or
conditions
of
employment,
says
terms
tenure
or
conditions
of
employment.
the
one
word
tenure
is
the
difference.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
correct.
but
i
think
the
definition
does
point
that
it
must
be
a
dispute
over
the
terms
or
conditions
of
employment
or
over
the
right
to
represent
persons
in
seeking
to
arrange
terms
or
conditions
of
employment.
and
if
as
the
respondent
say
in
their
reply
brief,
they
are
concerned
and
don't
want
to
change
wages,
hours
or
working
conditions
aboard
this
vessel
and
don't
want
to
represent
this
crew,
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
where
there
would
be
any
labor
dispute
even
if
this
were
an
american
flag
vessel.
now,
i
hasten
to
--
to
point
out
that
i
don't
think
the
records
supports
the
interpretation
of
this
dispute
which
counsel
has
put
on
in
it
the
last
minute
in
this
reply
brief.
it's
not
the
position
they
took
anywhere
up
until
that
time.
the
position
which
they
took
in
their
opening
brief
in
this
court
is
it
stated
at
the
top
of
page
13
of
that
brief
and
it
states
the
evidence
shows
that
the
controversy
between
the
parties
concerns
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
the
fact
is
that
when
this
vessel
arrived
in
court
mr.
willoughby,
the
petitioners
seattle
agent,
went
aboard
the
vessel.
and
at
page
61
of
the
record,
he
testified
that
he
told
the
captain,
"well,
i
told
him
by
virtue
of
the
policy
of
my
union
that
i
was
interested
in
the
wages,
hours
and
conditions
existing
aboard
the
ship."
at
page
29
of
the
record,
in
his
affidavit,
he's
outlined
his
efforts
to
find
somebody
with
whom
he
could
negotiate
and
states
that
affiant
has
not
been
able
to
find
or
talk
with
any
person
or
persons
in
this
area
or
been
referred
to
any
person
who
could
be
contacted
by
long
distance
who
would
admit
to
having
authority
to
negotiate
and
to
adjust
the
difference
with
affiant's
organization.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
both
their
briefs,
they
made
quite
clear
that
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
change
the
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
aboard
the
vessel.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
then,
i
think,
we
come
to
the
real
legal
question
in
this
case
which
is
whether
the
term,
labor
dispute,
was
intended
by
congress
to
encompass
a
dispute
over
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
aboard
a
foreign
flag
vessel.
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
go
into
that
question
now.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
yes.
if
their
intention
was
to
negotiate
concerning
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
aboard
this
vessel,
then
unless
the
foreign
aspect
takes
it
out
from
the
norris-laguardia
act
as
we
contend,
i
think
that
it
would
be
within
the
scope
of
that
act.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
the
position
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
that
the
record
should
be
read
on
that
basis
that
they
were
seeking
to
change
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions,
if
--
if
not,
i
don't
see
how
there
would
be
any
labor
dispute
here
at
all.
but
i
think
that
the
records
supports
them
that
far.
that
they
were
seeking
to
change
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
to
bring
them
up
to
the
american
standard
so
that
that
competitive
difference
would
be
eliminated
between
the
foreign
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
--
i
think
exactly
that
that
is
the
problem
which
has
led
this
court
in
the
past
to
say
that
the
delicate
international
relations
and
the
possibilities
of
retaliation
in
these
situations,
make
this
a
matter
for
the
executive
and
the
congress
to
negotiate
and
to
specifically
spell
out,
if
they
want
our
laws
to
apply
to
foreign
ships.
because
if
we
can
insist
that
a
ship
and
this
ship
is
a
tramp
vessel,
a
great
claim
here
that
it
entered
this
trade.
well,
it
had
signed
articles
in
cardiff,
wales
two
years
before.
it
had
been
all
over
the
world.
it
had
never
been
in
this
trade
before
.
it
came
in
this
one
time
to
deliver
this
cargo.
the
testimony
was
that
it
wasn't
coming
back
to
the
northwest.
it
was
going
to
europe.
now,
if
a
vessel
that
comes
in
like
that
for
one
call,
serves
as
a
focus
where
we
can
come
aboard
and
say,
"you
negotiate
for
this
ship
american
standards
and
conditions,
then
every
ship
--
that
every
port
that
it
touches,
can
be
subject
to
the
same
renegotiation
according
to
the
local
laws
and
customs.
and
it
is
that
which
has
led
the
nations
through
comity
to
recognize
the
law
of
the
flag.
normally
in
a
contract
situation,
you'll
to
the
place
of
performance
or
the
place
where
the
contracts
executed,
but
this
court
has
said
that
those
things
for
seamen
are
--
are
pretty
much
where
a
matter
of
happenstance.
and
so
the
law
of
the
flag
governs.
the
articles
are
governed
by
the
law
of
the
flag,
the
relations
aboard
the
ship
are
governed
by
the
law
of
the
flag
and
only
in
rare
instances
such
as
where
the
tranquility
of
a
port
is
disturbed
or
where
congress
specifically
spells
out
as
it
has
in
a
few
instances,
that
our
laws
are
to
apply.
do
american
laws
apply
to
a
foreign
ship
within
our
harbors?
now,
the
romero
case
which
is
important
here
on
another
point
to
but
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
that
the
congress
could
--
could
certainly
say
that,
your
honor.
the
question
here
is
whether
in
passing
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
defining
labor
dispute
in
it,
they
intended
that
to
encompass
a
labor
dispute
on
a
foreign
flag
vessel.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
no,
not
an
american
citizen,
an
american
ship.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
--
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
this
was
an
american
flag
vessel,
there
would
be
a
labor
dispute
here,
leaving
aside
a
question
which
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
into
as
to
whether
they
can
try
to
change
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
while
articles
of
shipping
are
in
effect
or
whether
they
have
to
wait
until
the
termination
of
particular
articles.
but
i
think
that
generally,
there
is
no
right
question,
but
what
a
--
an
american
union
has
a
right
at
some
point
to
go
into
the
question
of
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
aboard
on
american
flag
vessel.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
intended
that
an
american
union
be
free
from
the
prohibition
of
an
injunction
in
a
dispute
over
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
aboard
a
foreign
flag
vessel.
and,
i
think,
it
may
go
farther
than
mere
injunctive
relief,
because
the
court
has
indicated
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
serves
as
a
shield
not
only
against
injunctive
relief,
but
to
a
substantive
effect.
in
the
hutcheson
case,
they
said,
there
could
be
no
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
think
that
by
amendment
of
the
clayton
act
as
--
as
counsel
argues
and
we
could
concede,
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
applies,
then
their
conduct
is
probably
protected
from
being
a
violation
of
any
law
of
the
united
states
in
this
situation.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that
legislation
was
collected
by
the
courts,
your
honor,
in
the
benz
decision.
it's
largely
a
series
of
enactments
relating
to
the
advances
of
pay
to
seaman
and
the
right
to
make
a
draw
by
a
seaman
in
an
american
court.
and
the
congress
has
specifically
said
that
a
seaman
aboard
a
foreign
flag
vessel
has
the
right
to
make
a
demand
for
pay
in
an
american
court.
the
whole
series
of
--
of
acts
and
the
controversies
that
grew
out
of
them
are
outlined
in
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
most
of
it
occurred,
your
honor,
in
the
early
part
of
this
century,
from
about
1910
through
the
early
1920s,
i
believe.
i
don't
believe
there
has
been
any
specific
act
of
congress
applying
our
laws
to
foreign
ships,
since
that
time.
the
--
congress
did
in
1938
passed
an
act
which
is
no
longer
in
effect
governing
labor
relations
aboard
merchant
vessels,
specifically.
that's
referred
to
in
our
brief.
it
was
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
most
of
them
are
and,
i
believe,
our
courts
have
shown
a
tendency
to
apply
the
general
admiralty
law
to
foreign
seaman,
except
in
some
cases,
they
have
said
that
the
jurisdiction
might
not
be
mandatory.
it's
a
discretionary
jurisdiction
sometime
in
our
court
whether
to
entertain
suits
between
foreigners
over
those
questions.
and
sometimes,
they
have
refused
where
they
felt
that
a
better
remedy
or
a
better
forum
for
the
trial
was
in
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
in
the
country
of
the
flag,
or
in
the
country
where
the
parties,
themselves,
resided.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
it's
not
revealed
in
the
record,
your
honor.
the
panama
steamship
company
was
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and,
of
course,
the
owner
was
the
one
who
hired
the
crew.
it's
a
liberian
corporation.
the
only
thing
the
record
shows
is
some
knowledge
that
the
captain
had
of
--
he
--
he
referred
to
the
owners
as
greeks
in
london,
but
when
pinned
down,
he
didn't
know
whether
they
owned
the
stock
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
or
were
managing
agents.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
it's
--
it's
something
that
counsel
devised
and
i
don't
think
it
inaccurately
portrays
the
relations
between
the
parties.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
no.
it
owned
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
it
owned
the
stock
in
the
charterer
of
the
vessel.
now,
the
time
charterer
of
the
vessel
has
nothing
to
do
with
labor
relations
aboard
the
vessel.
it
wasn't
a
bearable
charterer.
it
was
a
time
charterer
and
all
they
did
was
hire
the
ship
to
carry
a
cargo
of
--
from
one
--
well,
they
hired
it
for
a
period
of
time
and
during
that
time,
used
it
to
carry
this
cargo.
but
the
labor
relations
were
set
between
the
owner
and
the
crew
and
the
time
charterer
had
nothing
to
do
with
those,
it's
--
it's
no
different
than
if
i
book
passage
for
a
30-day
cruise
on
the
queen
mary,
i'm
chartering
some
space
on
that
vessel
for
a
period
of
time,
but
i
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
labor
relations
aboard
the
vessel.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
so,
if
the
intent
was
as
it
was
here.
in
my
opinion,
to
change
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
aboard
a
foreign
flag
vessel,
which
is
only
transiently
in
our
ports.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
so,
your
honor,
because,
i
think,
the
question
is
whether
they
have
a
right
to
dispute
over
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
on
a
foreign
flag
vessel.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
if
the
employment
is
domestic
to
this
country,
i
think
possibly
they
have
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
know
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
--
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
this
is
a
--
this
is
shipping
and
it
--
its
--
its
unique
in
this
sense
that
it's
the
only
case
were
foreign
conditions
of
employment
actually
come
into
the
united
states
territorial
waters.
but
i
don't
think
it's
any
different
than
if
the
united
auto
workers
picketed
general
motors
and
said,
"we
want
you
to
stop
paying
german
wages
in
your
opel
factories
in
germany."
or
someone
picketed
general
electric
and
said,
"we
don't
want
you
to
--
to
build
anymore
parts
in
japan
for
our
television
sets
using
japanese
labor."
it's
a
question
of
whether
american
labor
has
the
right
to
picket
over
the
use
of
foreign
labor
and
--
and
to
try
to
change
the
conditions
of
labor
all
over
the
world.
now,
in
past
cases,
the
court
has
been
very
clear
that
when
congress
wanted
to
apply
our
laws,
labor
laws,
to
foreign
employment,
it
required
that
that
be
spelled
out.
there
was
a
case
of
foley
bros.
versus
filardo,
which
involved
the
eight
hour
act.
and
there
you
had
an
american
employer
and
american
employee,
working
on
the
united
states
base
in
iran.
and
the
question
was
whether
the
eight
hour
law
applied
to
that
employment.
and
the
court
said
there
was
universal
language.
every
laborer,
every
employer,
it
said,
this
does
not
apply,
because
if
congress
wants
us
to
apply
laws
to
situations
of
labor
in
foreign
countries,
where
everyone
knows
labor
conditions
are
far
different,
they
must
specifically
spell
it
out.
in
another
transportation
field,
there
have
been
two
cases,
as
to
whether
the
federal
mediation
board
had
jurisdiction
to
determine
a
bargaining
agent
or
hold
a
representational
election
for
the
right
to
represent
airline
dispatchers
working
in
foreign
country.
and
both
the
board
and
the
--
the
courts
of
appeal,
upholding
them,
have
said
not.
they
have
said
that
congress
must
be
explicit
when
it
wants
us
to
apply
american
laws
to
foreign
employment
situations.
then
they
closest
case
we
have,
of
course,
is
the
benz
case,
which
was
a
situation
virtually
identical
with
his
concerning
the
labor
management
relations
act.
you
had
there
an
american
union
picketing
a
liberian
vessel
in
an
american
port.
and
the
question
was
whether
the
taft-hartley
act
preempted
the
district
of
the
--
of
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
now,
that
was
a
jurisdictional
question
just
as
this
is
a
jurisdictional
question.
there,
as
here,
the
crew
was
foreign
and
had
signed
articles
subject
to
liberian
law
abroad.
and
there
is
here,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
were
far
below
those
in
american
ships
competing.
and
there
as
here,
the
union
said
that
we
are
trying
--
they
--
they
clearly
said
there
as
they
don't
here,
“we
want
to
represent
this
crew
and
--
and
be
its
bargaining
agent."
but
they
also
said,
“we're
trying
to
protect
our
interest
in
the
grain
trade
between
portland
and
india."
and,
i
think,
that
if
in
that
case,
the
taft-hartley
act
didn't
apply
with
virtually
--
except
for
that
one
word
tenure
the
same
definition
of
labor
dispute.
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
apply
in
this
situation.
getting
outside
the
labor
field,
we
have
the
example
of
romero
and
lauritzen,
where
this
court
has
said
that
the
universal
--
every
seaman
of
the
jones
act
does
not
necessarily
apply
to
a
foreign
seaman
injured
aboard
a
foreign
ship.
and
in
romero,
the
court
specifically
pointed
that
it
would
be
--
it's
--
it's
not
within
any
policy
of
the
united
states
and
would
be
a
terrific
burden
on
commerce
if
the
standard
of
compensation
must
change
in
every
port
to
which
the
vessel
goes.
now
there,
you
were
talking
about
compensation
for
an
injury
which
may
or
may
not
occur.
but
i
think
the
standard
of
wages
is
much
more
significantly
a
standard
of
compensation
that
can't
change
in
every
port
to
which
the
vessel
goes.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
act
itself
says
nothing
about
applying
to
foreign
shipping
or
to
foreign
commerce
at
all.
if
you
look
at
the
--
its
legislative
history
which
we
have
included
a
few
excerpts
that
we
were
able
to
find
that
shed
any
light
at
all
and
they
aren't
talking
about
this
foreign
shipping
problem,
but
there
is
language
there,
such
as
the
court
relied
on
in
the
benz
case
that
it
was
enacted
to
take
care
of
domestic
disputes
involving
american
working
men,
the
working
men
of
this
country
which
would
indicate
that
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
in
this
situation.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
that
the
reason,
so
far
as
it
applies
would
be
the
same,
your
honor.
i
think,
though,
that
the
question
here
is
--
certainly,
congress
has
since
given
back
to
the
courts
power
to
issue
injunctions
in
many
cases.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
here
the
--
the
problem
that
arises,
if
taft-hartley
doesn't
apply,
if
we
aren't
going
to
go
aboard
these
ships
and
certify
collective
bargaining
agents,
then
there
is
no
equality
if
these
treaty
means
equality
between
of
--
the
owner
of
a
foreign
ship
and
the
owner
of
an
american
ship,
because
without
certification,
you
can
never
put
an
end
to
your
labor
disputes.
whereas,
in
--
on
the
american
ship,
once
you
had
a
bargaining
agent,
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
you
could
get
an
injunction
through
the
board,
if
some
other
union
came
along
and
picketed
you.
under
the
new
act,
if
somebody
wants
to
represent
the
seaman
aboard
a
ship,
they
--
or
aboard
it
--
for
any
employer,
they
can
picket,
but
within
30
days,
they
must
apply
to
become
for
an
--
certification
election.
here,
they
could
never
apply
under
the
interpretation
that's
been
given
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
so,
you
would
have
the
situation
that
one
union
could
picket
for
30
days
then
it
would
to
stop,
perhaps,
if
there's
any
way
to
get
to
the
board
to
stop
it.
but
another
union
could
come
along.you
just
never
have
an
end
to
the
organizational
problem
which
are
our
laws
supplementing
norris-laguardia
have
taken
care
of
for
american
employers.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
probably
that
the
same
result
would
obtain,
in
this
case,
in
a
state
court.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
you'd
have
the
same
problem.
there
was
a
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
--
i
think,
this
is
a
maritime
tort
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
in
this
case.
and
i
think
the
maritime
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
all
right.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
no.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
--
i
think
it
could
be
a
savings
clause
action
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
in
the
state
court.
the
state
would
have
a
little
norris-laguardia
act,
where
you'd
have
the
same
problem
of
whether
this
was
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
that
particular
act,
instead
of
the
federal
act,
you
might
have
different
legislate
history,
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
can't.
it
--
it's
well
up
in
--
to
close
to
30,
i
think
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
--
as
we
contend,
this
is
a
maritime
tort.
it
is
one
which
--
of
which
the
federal
courts
have
maritime
jurisdiction
and
any
--
the
--
the
court
in
romero
said
that
any
case,
regardless
of
the
remedy,
saw
it
as
a
case
of
admiralty
in
maritime
jurisdiction.
if
that's
true,
if
you
brought
it
in
the
state
court,
it
would
be
a
savings
clause
action,
i
believe.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
if
the
state
court
has
a
common
law
remedy.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
there
are
cases,
your
honor,
supreme
court
cases
reviewing
state
court
decisions
which
hold
that
a
suit
for
equitable
relief
is
a
savings
clause
action
that
the
common
law
remedy
was
not
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
the
english
law
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
what
--
the
question,
if
i
understood
it,
was
whether
an
injunction
which
is
an
equitable
remedy
was
within
the
meaning
of
the
savings
clause
--
saving
the
suitors
all
remedies,
which
the
common
law
is
confident
to
provide.
and
the
court
has
interpreted
common
law
there,
to
be
the
english
law
including
equitable
remedies
as
well
as
a
common
law
remedies.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
an
important
one.
and
i
think,
probably,
the
--
the
rest
of
my
time
would
best
be
devoted
to
it.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
the
basic
jurisdiction
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
of
the
district
court
was
challenged
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
district
court,
the
only
argument
had
been
the
one
we've
had
here
so
far
as
to
whether
norris-laguardia
labor
dispute
was
present.
the
court
of
appeals
found
jurisdiction
under
section
1331.
and
as
counsel
points
out,
there
is
a
seeming
conflict
between
that
decision
and
the
decision
of
this
court
last
year
in
romero.
now,
i
think
the
sounder
basis
for
jurisdiction
here
is
in
admiralty,
which
--
and
the
question
is
whether
admiralty
has
the
power
to
issue
the
equitable
relief
of
an
injunction.
at
the
outset,
i'll
say
that
there
is
dictum
in
decisions
of
this
court
that
admiralty
does
not
have
equitable
remedial
powers
and
does
not
issue
injunctions
except
in
cases
of
limitation
of
liability.
however,
that
decision
was
in
the
case
of
schoenamsgruber
versus
hamburg
american
line.
these
cases
are
discussed
at
22
and
--
to
24
of
our
brief.
that
was
a
--
a
case
in
which
the
question
was
whether
a
--
a
district
court
could
stay
proceedings
pending
arbitration.
and
the
court
held
that
it
could
and
in
the
process
of
it,
noted
that
a
stay
of
proceedings
was
not
an
injunction,
but
it
went
on
to
have
this
gratuitous
language
that
admiralty
doesn't
issue
injunctions.
there
are
earlier
cases.
the
eclipse
is
perhaps
the
fountain
of
this
doctrine
from
the
supreme
court.
that
was
a
case
where
the
request
was
that
a
court
of
admiralty,
reform
a
contract
for
the
sale
of
a
vessel
and
enforce
some
trust
provisions.
now,
admiralty
doesn't
deal
with
sales
of
vessels
to
begin
with.
the
sale
of
a
vessel
is
not
a
--
a
suit
over
the
sale
of
a
vessel
isn't
the
suit
in
admiralty.
so,
of
course,
this
claim
for
equitable
relief,
in
connection
with
a
sale
of
a
vessel,
wouldn't
be
within
admiralty.
the
court
there
noted
the
claims
were
--
there
was
nothing
maritime
about
the
claims.
that
was
the
language
of
the
court.
yet,
it
went
on
to
give
again
this
dictum
that
admiralty
--
although
it
exercises
its
jurisdiction
upon
equitable
principles,
has
not
the
characteristic
powers
of
the
court
of
equity.
now,
i
think
recent
decisions
of
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
real
doctrine
is
that
when
admiralty
has
jurisdiction,
when
the
basic
subject
matter
of
the
suit
is
an
admiralty
claim,
admiralty
has
equitable
powers,
whenever
they're
necessary
to
justice.
romero,
itself,
said
that
all
claims
regardless
of
the
remedy
sought
involving
a
maritime
cause
of
action
where
cases
of
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
it
said
that
in
giving
its
reason
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
under
1331,
that
the
admiralty
courts
had
been
completely
adequate
to
the
vindication
or
protection
of
rights
grounded
in
federal
maritime
law.
now,
if
they
didn't
have
equitable
powers
when
they
were
necessary,
they
couldn't
be
completely
adequate
to
the
protection
of
those
rights.
in
swift
&
company
versus
compania
colombiana,
in
1950,
this
court
pointed
out
a
lot
of
this
dicta
in
passed
decision
and
described
them
as
a
good
deal
of
loose
talk
and
said
that
in
that
case,
admiralty
could
set
aside
the
fraudulent
transfer
of
a
vessel.
the
libel
there
was
in
personam
with
foreign
attachment
and
the
attachment
was
necessary
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
the
basic
libel
was
clearly
within
admiralty's
jurisdiction.
and
the
court
there
--
what
happened?
the
respondent
in
the
suit
transferred
the
vessel
to
somebody
else,
before
it
was
attached.
and
unless
that
fraud
--
that
transfer
which
the
court
held
was
fraudulent,
could
be
set
aside.
the
attachment
would
have
to
be
dissolved
and
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
the
lower
court
did
not
deal
with
it.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
in
--
in
the
district
court,
no
question
of
jurisdiction
was
raised,
your
honor.
the
pleading
has
denominated
the
complaint,
not
a
libel,
so
we
clearly
--
as
far
as
labor
was
concerned,
weren't
on
the
admiralty
side.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
situation
was
this.
the
arguments
were
both
had
before
this
court's
decision
in
romero.
there
we
briefly
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
admiralty
was
a
possible
basis
of
jurisdiction,
but
our
main
argument
was
centered
around
the
--
what
was
decided
in
--
in
romero.
we
were
arguing
that
any
case
of
federal
merit
--
involving
federal
maritime
law
was
one
arising
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states,
within
the
meaning
of
section
1333.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
followed
the
dicta
of
this
court
and
said
that
admiralty
cannot
issue
an
injunction,
but
said
this
is
a
clear
distinction
from
the
situation
in
romero,
because
romero
had
a
completely
adequate
remedy
in
admiralty.
here,
this
is
a
case
in
equity.
it
is
--
there
is
no
completely
adequate
remedy
in
admiralty
and
therefore,
we
think
that
the
reasoning
of
romero
would
not
apply
to
this
case.
and
since
it
is
a
maritime
claim
arising
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
it
is
one
where
federal
question
jurisdiction
exists.
there
is
no
implied
exception
as
was
found
in
romero,
because
of
the
--
an
adequate
alternative
remedy.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
it
did
deal
with
it.
yes
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
you're
--
you're
right.
the
lower
--
the
court
of
appeals
followed
the
dicta
of
this
court
and
said
that
admiralty
can't
issue
an
injunction
based
on
the
eclipse
and
the
hamburg
american
line
case.
but
it
was
not
argued
at
any
great
length,
if
that's
your
point
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
it
was,
your
honor.
and
they
decided
that
it
could
not
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
therefore,
there
was
no
adequate
remedy
in
admiralty
contrary,
i
think,
to
the
decision
of
romero
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
was
completely
adequate
and
that
all
cases,
regardless
of
the
remedy
sought,
were
cases
of
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
but
if
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
judge
pope
did
not
say
that.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
judge
pope
--
i
think
the
other
two
judges
said
that,
your
honor.
judge
pope
just
very
briefly
said
that
the
basis
of
romero
was
that
there
was
a
completely
adequate
jurisdiction
for
romero
in
the
smoothly
functioning
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
he
doesn't
say
it's
an
equity,
but
he
says
it
isn't
an
admiralty.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
for
--
i
think
your
answer
would
have
been
the
better
one.
it
was
considered
below
and
--
and
both
the
majority
and
minority
decisions
held
that
admiralty
could
not
issue
an
injunction.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
your
honor,
the
suit
here
was
to
stop
picketing
which
was
occurring
on
navigable
waters
with
one
ship
circling
around
another.
it
was
to
stop
the
intentional
interference
with
maritime
contracts
of
affreightment
and
for
the
discharge
of
the
vessel.
the
court
found
that
it
was
the
intention
of
petitioners,
through
their
picketing
and
through
their
circling
and
through
the
threats
which
they
made
to
the
consignee
of
the
cargo
to
prevent
this
ship
from
securing
a
berth
and
discharging
its
cargo.
now,
those
were
maritime
rights,
the
right
to
proceed
with
the
vessel,
the
right
between
--
the
contract
between
the
vessel
and
the
--
the
dock,
which
were
interfered
with.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
they
maybe
both
your
honor,
but
i
think
they're
clearly
maritime
rights.
they
may
also,
as
we
argue
and
this
is
an
alternative
ground
of
jurisdiction
that
these
rights
arise
under
the
treaty
between
the
republic
of
liberia
and
the
united
states
mr.
john
d.
mosser
under
--
well,
our
action
is
in
tort.
i
think
that's
clear.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
they
--
the
basic
cause
of
action
is
for
a
tort.
certainly,
if
it
were
not
a
tort,
i
don't
think
you
could
enjoin
it.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
so.
and
if
you
look
at
section
1350
of
the
judicial
code,
it
specifically
gives
a
--
a
right
of
action
to
any
alien
and
all
the
plaintiffs'
respondents
here
were
aliens.
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
by
an
alien
for
tort
only,
committed
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
or
a
treaty
of
the
united
states,
so
the
judicial
code
clearly
recognizes
that
you
can
have
a
tort
violation
of
a
treaty.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
if
your
--
that
if,
as
i
said,
this
is
an
alternative
ground
of
jurisdiction
and
one
which
we
urged
both
below
and
hear
that
under
1331
or
1315,
we've
added
in
this
court,
if
there
is
a
right
here
under
a
treaty
or
the
law
of
nations
which
was
violated,
then
there
is
a
federal
question
entirely
separate
from
the
maritime
rights
that
are
involved.
it's
only
if
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
is
maritime
that
you
get
into
the
question
of
whether
the
jurisdiction
is
in
admiralty
under
1333
or
under
1331,
under
the
exception
which
the
court
below
found
to
the
romero
decision.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
treaty
provide
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
i
--
i
will
say
this.
it
presents
--
there
is
no
clear
case
which
has
held
the
exact
thing
that
we
are
supporting.
i
think
that
by
logic,
you
can
move
through
the
steps
that
we
have
in
our
brief
here
and
arrive
at
that
jurisdiction.
the
treaty
was
proclaimed
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
binding
upon
not
only
the
government
of
the
united
states,
but
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
it
granted
rights
to
the
individuals.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
--
i
think
that's
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
it
--
it
doesn't
say
in
black
and
white.
there's
a
cause
of
action,
if
somebody
pickets
here.
[laughs]
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
i
think
it
--
i
think
in
gray,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
i'll
make
it
heavy
[laughter].
you
might
find
it
light.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
there
is
language
in
the
treaty
which
would
indicate
an
equality
of
rights
between
liberians
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
you
have
to
interpret
what
inequality
they
were
talking
about,
whether
they
meant
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
apply,
for
example,
in
that
sort
of
thing
and
you
have
to
look
at
whether
when
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
no.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
don't
think
this
--
one
thing
i
would
point
out
that
this
isn't
necessarily
a
reciprocal
treaty
or
one
which
creates
equal
rights.
it
states
that
vessels
of
liberia
in
our
waters
will
be
considered
vessels
of
liberia,
not
americans
ships.
it
specifically,
by
another
article,
prohibits
liberia.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
it
prohibits
liberia
from
entering
our
costal
trade.
in
other
words,
they're
not
made
equal
with
american
vessels
in
entering
our
coastal
trade.
there
are
some
equal
--
when
they
talk
about
entering
our
courts,
they
say
they
shall
enter
on
--
on
the
same
basis
as
american
citizens,
but
the
right
of
freedom
of
commerce
and
navigation,
as
guaranteed
by
this
treaty,
isn't
stated
in
terms
of
equality.
it
says
flatly,
there
shall
be
a
freedom
of
commerce
and
navigation
between
the
two
countries.
and
i
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
article
--
article
15
merely
makes
clear
that
the
vessel
is
one
of
liberia
--
to
be
treated
as
a
liberian
vessel,
regardless
of
ownership
for
a
consignee
or
anything
of
that
kind.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
article
7
is
quoted
at
page
two
of
our
brief
and
that's
the
one
that
it
says
that,
“between
the
territories
of
the
high
contracting
parties,
there
shall
be
freedom
of
commerce
and
navigation
in
the
nationals.”
and
here,
the
two
corporate
plaintiffs
are
liberian
nationals,
shall
have
the
right
to
come
and
go
with
their
vessels.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
your
honor,
there
was
no
claim
made
until
a
petition
for
rehearing
below
that
there
wasn't
a
--
a
tort
here,
if
norris-laguardia
didn't
protect
the
conduct.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
they
haven't
really
challenged
that
there
is.
we've
cited
some
cases
on
our
brief
that
show
that
this
is
a
--
a
--
that
interference
with
maritime
contractual
relation
is
a
maritime
tort.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
no.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
your
honor's
question
is
whether
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
yes.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
you
apply
that
the
--
if
you
determine
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
applies,
well,
then
clearly,
the
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
the
injunctive
relief
has
clearly
ended
and
i
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
the
suit
was
for
damages
as
well.
but
at
the
present
time,
the
only
thing
on
appeal
is
the
injunction,
so
your
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
the
court
would
not
necessarily
reach
the
other
question.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
the
injunction,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
right.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
you
would
reverse
the
judgement
below
and
remand,
i
don't
think
you
would
direct
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
two
burdens.
we
have
to
show
fundamental
jurisdiction
and
we
have
to
show
that
there
is
no
labor
dispute.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
if
--
if
you
resolve
either
of
those
questions
against
this,
i
suppose
it
--
it
terminates
the
case
against
us
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
to
that
extent.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
that
the
normal
method
by
which
the
court
proceeds
is
to
first
consider
basic
jurisdiction,
but
i
don't
suppose
there's
anything
that
requires
that
and
if
the
court
wanted
to
say,
we
don't
have
to
consider
basic
jurisdiction,
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
right
to
issue
an
injunction
here
anyway.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
it
could
reverse
on
that
ground.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
either
question
of
jurisdiction
could
be
conclusive
no
matter
what
if
you
decided
it
against
us.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
to
grant
up
an
injunction
by
the
district
court.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
certainly.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
right
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
several
alternative
bases,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
there
is
a
basis
of
jurisdiction
under
1331
and
1350
because
of
treaty
rights.
there
is
a
jurisdiction
under
1333
because
of
maritime
rights
and
we
claim
that
admiralty
has
the
power
to
issue
an
injunction.
if
admiralty
has
not
the
power
to
issue
an
injunction,
there
is
a
basis
under
1331
because
of
the
substantive
maritime
law
applied
and
no
adequate
alternative
remedy
in
admiralty.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
don't
think
the
rights
under
1331
and
1350
which
are
based
on
treaty
rights
necessarily
involved
the
maritime
nature
of
the
case,
so
i
think
the
--
that
certainly
the
rights
under
1333
or
the
right
under
1331,
because
of
maritime
tort
depends
upon
that
exception.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
right.
you
can
start
with
either
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
hope
you
will
reach
both
of
them
and
--
and
resolve
from
both
in
favor
of
the
respondents
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
and
affirm
the
judgement
below.
thank
you
