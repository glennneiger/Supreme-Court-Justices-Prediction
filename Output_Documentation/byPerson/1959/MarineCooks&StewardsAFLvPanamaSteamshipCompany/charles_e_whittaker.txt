justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
wouldn't
argue
why
i
take
it,
mr.
jennings
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
apply
outside
our
country.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
about
the
rule
of
law
that
ships
on
our
waters,
foreign
ships
or
foreign
territory?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
but
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
could
it
be
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
our
law
if
it
happened
in
foreign
territory?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
the
controversy
is
one
that
happened
in
foreign
territory,
could
it
be
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
i
have
assumed
that
the
decks
of
a
foreign
vessel
with
foreign
areas
though
in
our
waters?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
if
as
matter
of
law
and
american
union
could
have
a
labor
dispute
with
the
employees
with
the
foreign
government
or
the
foreign
ship.
what
do
you
think
of
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
who
had
signed
on
in
liberia?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh
but
you
--
did
you
have
a
dispute
with
anybody
or
could
you
have
a
“labor
dispute”
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
with
all
of
these
of
the
foreign
ships
in
our
waters.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
don't
you
have
–
don't
you
have
a
dispute
over
internal
conditions
on
this
liberian
ship?
weren't
you
complaining
about
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
these
conditions,
leaving
conditions
on
it
and
so
forth?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it's
true,
then
this
isn't
a
dispute
(inaudible)
such
as
to
create
dissatisfaction
on
their
people.
if
you
can
be
subject
to
their
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
mosser,
why
do
you
say
this
is
involved
in
the
maritime
claim?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
were
they
such
or
were
they
rights
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
treaty
applies
only,
does
it
not,
as
to
claims
grounded
in
resounding
in
tort?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
an
action
for
an
injunction
is
one
in
tort?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
you
use
the
word
tort
as
a
result
of
an
infringement
of
a
constitutional
right
to
do
interstate
to
inform
commerce?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
think
that's
a
tort?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
question
that.
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
this
is
an
action
for
an
injunction
in
equity,
it's
on
the
law
side
of
the
court
under
section
1333.
and
that
you
have
a
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
that
the
actions,
one
that
does
arise
on
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states
and
you
never
run
into
the
romero
problem.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
not,
is
that
quite
correct?
would
you
not
have
to
first
be
in
the
court
that
had
power
to
hear
before
the
norris-laguardia
question
prohibiting
injunctions
in
special
cases
would
arise?
so
don't
you
have
to
show
a
fundamental
basis
of
jurisdiction
in
the
court
before
you
get
to
the
norris-laguardia
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
my
point
is
that
before
we
can
get
to
the
norris-laguardia
question,
do
we
not
have
to
find
that
there
was
--
there
would
be
jurisdiction
otherwise?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
granted
an
injunction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then,
for
you
to
keep
that
judgement
and
getting
affirmance,
if
the
questions
so
feel,
you'll
have
to
show,
would
you
not,
both
basic
jurisdiction
and
non-applicability
of
norris-laguardia?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
then
do
you
not
have
to
sustain
here
both
burdens
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
if
you
--
if
you're
to
win?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
what's
the
basis
of
your
jurisdiction,
your
fundamental
jurisdiction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
everyone
of
your
hypotheses
includes
the
assumption
that
this
is
a
“maritime
claim”
as
contemplated
within
the
meaning
of
footnote
23
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
romero
case.
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
court
was
at
pains
in
this
footnote
23
to
point
out,
that
all
suits
involving
maritime
claims
regardless
of
the
remedies
sought,
our
case
is
in
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction,
but
they
first
have
to
be
maritime
claims.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
you
say
this
is
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
many
cases
--
doesn't
the
harrisburg
hold
the
crime
committed
in
the
port
of
new
york
confined
vessel
is
one
committed
on
foreign
island
or
foreign
lands,
foreign
territory?
