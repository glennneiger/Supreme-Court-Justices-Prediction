mr.
jennings,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
make
any
difference
--
would
it
make
any
difference
in
this
case
if
they
didn't
have
a
question
of
substandard
wages,
and
if
it
was
just
a
question
of
a
foreign
ship
as
against
an
american
ship?
i
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
principle
be
any
different?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jennings
may
i
interrupt
to
just
one
more
--
once
more
to
ask
you
if
--
it
would
make
any
difference
in
principle
in
this
case
if
the
consignee,
i
mean
the
charters
were
all
foreign
corporations
instead
of
americans,
would
that
bear
on
it
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
as
i
understood
that
this
is
an
america
charter,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
the

et
al.,

versus

et

mr.
mosser,
you
may
proceed
with
the
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
get
to
that,
i
--
i
wonder
if
conceding
everything
that
you
say,
mr.
mosser,
if
--
if
this
country
doesn't
have
the
right
to
--
to
say,
well
you
can't
have
an
injunction
in
these
circumstances.
perhaps
you
could
have
damages
or
something
else
to
compensate
you
for
any
loss,
it
--
it
might
be
occasion,
but
the
policy
of
our
nation
is
that
--
that
in
this
--
in
these
circumstances,
you
can't
have
an
injunction
anymore
than
one
of
our
own
sentences
could
get
an
injunction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
i
--
i
understand
that.
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
your
argument
just
a
moment
ago
about
the
foreign
vessel,
you
were
taking
the
position
that
if
--
if
we
interfered
with
them
here,
we
would
be
denying
them
the
comity
and
the
--
and
the
rights
under
their
--
their
treaty
that
they
were
entitled
to,
namely,
to
--
to
protection
while
they're
in
our
country.
now,
it
--
it
may
be
that
our
--
our
congress
wants
to
limit
not
on
their
own
citizens,
but
everybody
to
a
particular
kind
of
action.
and
the
only
question
is
whether
they
have
done
it
here
under
the
--
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
but
as
i
understood
you,
a
moment
ago,
in
response
to
justice
frankfurter,
you
--
you
said
that
you
believe
that
they
--
that
they
were
making
a
claim
in
this
case,
that
is
the
union,
which
--
which
would've
prevented
the
granting
of
an
injunction
in
the
event
this
was
a
--
american
citizen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
an
american
ship.
yes.
yes,
i'm
--
i'm
sure
that
you
said
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jennings.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jennings,
i
--
i
notice
from
your
--
your
conclusion
in
your
brief
that
you
--
you
asked
in
the
event,
we
decide
in
your
favor
that
the
action
be
dismissed.
does
that
mean
that
we
--
we
should
reach
both
jurisdictional
questions
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
we
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
