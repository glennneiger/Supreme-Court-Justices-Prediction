mr.
john
paul
jennings
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
case
in
which
that
court
has
sustained
a
district
court
order
enjoining
peaceful
picketing
by
my
client,
a
labor
union.
the
picketing
protested
the
loss
of
jobs
to
members
of
the
marine
cooks
&
stewards,
the
petitioner,
and
possible
loss
of
more
jobs
in
the
future
when
a
foreign
vessel,
the
nikolos,
a
vessel
of
liberian
registry,
entered
a
trade
previously
occupied
by
an
american
vessel
and
resulting
in
the
lay
off
of
the
american
vessel
and
loss
of
jobs
to
the
members
of
the
petitioners'
union.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
trade
between
the
west
coast
of
mexico
and
tacoma,
washington.
this
trade
had
been
occupied
by
american
vessel,
the
ira
nelson
morris
and
that
ship
was
laid
off,
the
nikolos
went
into
the
trade.
we
also
--
we
maintain
that
the
case,
it's
a
case
involving
or
growing
out
of
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
therefore,
the
injunction
was
improperly
granted.
we
also
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
which
was
predicated
on
a
theory
which
we
think
this
court
rejected
in
romero
against
international
terminal
operating
company
in
1959,
that
is
that
a
--
a
federal
question
case
under
section
1331
can
be
predicated
upon
a
maritime
tort,
that
was
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now
these
are
the
facts.
the
petitioner,
marine
cooks
&
stewards
afl,
is
one
of
a
number
of
american
unions
representing
seamen
on
the
pacific
coast.
the
marine
cooks
&
stewards
represents
the
stewards
department
pursuant
to
a
certification
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
that
it's
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
contract
establishing
wages,
hours,
and
conditions
and
welfare
provisions
and
pension
plans,
and
things
of
that
nature.
now
shortly
before
this
case
arose
in
june
of
1957,
willoughby,
the
agent
of
the
marine
cooks
&
stewards
in
the
port
of
seattle,
washington
learned
that
the
nikolos
was
going
to
come
in
to
the
salt
trade
between
the
west
coast
of
mexico
and
the
hooker
electro-chemical
plants
in
tacoma,
washington.
mr.
willoughby
also
learned
that
the
ira
nelson
morris,
an
american
ship
employing
members
of
the
petitioner,
was
laid
off
as
a
consequence
of
the
entry
of
the
nikolos
into
the
trade
and
that
as
a
result,
members
of
the
various
unions,
including
members
of
the
petitioning
union,
were
laid
off.
mr.
willoughby
made
inquiry
of
the
hooker
company
in
tacoma
to
which
the
salt
was
consigned
asking
them
whether
they
would
permit
him
to
put
a
picket
line
adjacent
to
the
dock
when
the
nikolos
came
in.
he
told
them
that
he
indented
to
picket
the
ship
when
it
arrived
and
that
he
was
like
to
get
the
ship
dock,
he
would
also
picket
it
at
the
dock
and
he
wanted
to
picket
inside
because
he
wanted
to
avoid
the
charge
of
a
secondary
boycott
and
picketing
the
hooker
plant.
when
the
nikolos
arrived
on
the
early
morning
of
june
the
10th
of
1957,
mr.
willoughby
in
a
small
cabin
cruiser
called
the
willoughby
began
circling
around
the
nikolos.
the
little
cruiser
which
he
was
using
to
circle
around
had
a
sign
on
it
which
said
“picket
boat”
and
the
sign
was
later
changed
to
a
different
and
larger
sign
which
said
“afl-cio
seamen
protest
loss
of
their
livelihood
to
foreign
flagships
with
substandard
wages
or
substandard
conditions.”
willoughby,
during
the
course
of
his
circling,
was
invited
to
board
the
nikolos
and
he
talked
to
the
master
of
the
ship
and
he
told
him
that
the
nikolos
was
interfering
with
the
coastal
trade
and
that
that
was
why
he
was
picketing.
he
also
ascertained
at
that
time
that
the
wages
on
the
nikolos
were
about
one-fifth,
one-fifth
of
the
wages
on
american
ships
under
contract
to
the
petitioning
union.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
nikolos
is
a
ship
of
liberian
registry
your
honor.
it
is
owned
by
the
panama
steamship
company
which
is
a
panamanian
corporation
and
it
was
by
virtue
of
time
charter
and
sub
time
charter,
ultimately
time
chartered
by
sea
tankers
incorporated
which
is
one
of
the
respondents
in
this
proceeding.
if
i
might
--
it's
rather
involve
factual
situation
and
i
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no
your
honor,
they
were
not.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no
the
consignee
hadn't
made
a
contract
so
long
as
you
have
referred
to
it
the
chart
which
is
appendix
b
attached
to
our
brief
on
page
seven
shows
that
the
hooker
company
made
a
contract
of
affreightment
with
trans
sea
carriers
which
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
page
seven
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
(inaudible)
it
back.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
hooker
company
made
this
contract
of
affreightment
for
carriage
of
salt
from
mexico
to
the
hooker
plants,
with
trans
sea
carriers
incorporated.
trans
sea
sarriers
is
not
a
party
to
this
case.
it
is
a
foreign
corporation
and
a
wholly
on
subsidiary
national
boat
carriers
incorporated
which
is
a
new
york
corporation,
an
american
corporation.
national
boat
ccarriers
has
another
fully
on
subsidiary,
sea
tankers
incorporated
which
is
a
respondent
in
this
case
and
was
a
plaintiff
below.
sea
tankers
incorporated
got
the
contract
of
affreightment
by
a
subcontract
for
its
sister
subsidiary
trans
sea
carries
and
then
sea
tankers
incorporated
time
chartered
the
nikolos
from
the
north
atlantic
and
gulf
steamship
company
which
chartered
from
the
panama
steamship
company.
so
that
ultimately
it
ended
up
with
sea
tankers
the
holding
on
subsidiary
of
an
american
corporation
having
both
the
contract
to
carry
the
salt
and
having
the
nikolos
under
time
charter.
a
time
charter
in
case
your
honor
is
not
familiar
with,
it
is
a
rental
of
all
of
the
space
aboard
a
ship.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
sea
tanker
is
also
a
foreign
subsidiary,
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
an
american
corporation.
now
on
june
the
13th
of
1957
after
this
--
the
circling
of
the
ship
had
gone
on
for
three
days.
the
respondents
filed
their
complaint
on
the
civil
side,
seeking
an
injunction
and
damages.
after
hearing
testimony,
the
district
court
granted
a
temporary
injunction
on
june
19th
of
1957.
the
marine
cooks
&
stewards
was
enjoined
from
picketing
the
nikolos
or
any
other
vessel
registered
under
a
foreign
flag,
manned
by
an
alien
crew
and
operated
by
the
plaintiffs
or
any
of
them.
the
district
judge
believed
that
the
picketing
constituted
unlawful
interference
with
foreign
commerce
with
a
friendly
foreign
nation
and
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
did
not
forbid
an
injunction.
the
court,
however,
made
the
following
fact
findings.
in
finding
16,
which
is
on
page
35
of
the
record,
the
court
said,
“plaintiffs
or
some
of
them
have
entered
into
and
are
seeking
other
contracts
of
affreightment
covering
the
carriage
of
light
cargoes
from
mexican
ports
to
united
states
ports
in
the
puget
sound
area
and
to
hooker
electro-chemical
dock
in
tacoma
aboard
the
s.s.
nikolos
and
or
other
similarly
registered
unmanned
vessels
owned,
operated,
or
chartered
by
plaintiffs
or
some
of
them.
this
is
a
finding
that
the
plaintiffs
intended
to
go
into
this
business
in
a
larger
scale
which
naturally
would
result
in
more
loss
of
jobs
for
the
petitioner
union
and
the
court
so
found.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
tort
that,
as
i
understood
the
district
court's
finding
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that
this
was
an
unlawful
interference
with
foreign
commerce.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
mere
fact
of
picketing
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
may
have
been
one
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
think
that
was
part
of
it
and
i
believe
the
court
also
felt
that
because
this
was
a
foreign
registered
ship
it
is
a
liberian
registered
ship.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
against
the
use
of
this
ship.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
right.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
right.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
there
was
no
fraud,
no
violence
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
protest
was
substantially
at
the
picket
signs,
that
they
protested
the
lost
of
employment
for
their
membership
as
a
result
of
the
use
of
this
foreign
registered
ship
employing
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor,
employing
foreign
seaman
at
substandard
wages
and
conditions.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
contract
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
sea
tankers
incorporated
which
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
here
had
the
choice
and
they
selected
the
nikolos
to
carry
the
salt.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
know
nothing
in
any
legislation
which
says
either
they
could
or
could
not,
nor
do
i
know
of
anything
that
said
we
could
or
could
not
picket
because
they
made
a
choice.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
he
would
book
space
on
whatever
ship
he
desired
to
have.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
correct.
here
the
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
one
of
the
problems.
the
sea
tankers
incorporated
is
a
foreign
corporation.
the
ship
is
a
foreign
ship.
and
many
are
quite
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
don't
think
the
principle
of
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
be
any
different
your
honor
but
we
would
run
into
a
somewhat
different
question
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
picketing,
there
would
have
to
be
some
legitimate
objectives,
some
legitimate
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
judged
by
the
standards
on
american
ship
which
were
in
competition.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
the
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no,
that's
not
in
question.
but
answering
your
honor's
question
more
at
length,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
not
apply
in
any
case
in
which
--
or
would
apply
in
any
case
in
which
a
foreign
ship
was
picketed
because
the
norris-laguardia
act
withdraws
the
injunctive
remedy
and
says
that
a
united
states
district
court
may
not
in
a
labor
dispute,
use
a
conjunctive
remedy.
that
is
not
to
say
and
i
didn't
wish
to
infer
that
the
foreign
shipowner
would
be
without
a
remedy.
he
would
have
many
remedies
other
than
the
injunctive
remedies
such
as
a
--
possibly
a
suite
for
damages
in
a
diversity
case
or
perhaps
claim
an
injunction
in
a
diversity
case.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
not
in
norris-laguardia
act.
i
said
he
should
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
if
he
went
into
the
state
court,
he
could
go
in
and
claim
damages
and
he
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
guess
he
could
under
the
savings
clause
also
claim
injunctive
relief.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
unless
they
had
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
whatever
state
court
he
might
go
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
now
–-
mr.
john
paul
jennings
oh
no,
your
honor.
this
is
no
case
in
which
we're
playing
back
to
the
territorial
application
for
any
american
law.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
we
were
not
trying
to
apply
any
law
to
the
ship
itself,
the
law
that
we
applied
was
the
law
limiting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court
when
the
foreign
corporation
came
into
that
court
asking
for
a
relief.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
we
did
not
try
to
interfere
in
anyway
with
the
internal
economy
of
this
ship.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
well
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
now
that
the
ship
was
operating
and
--
foreign
commerce
and
we
picket
it
outside
the
united
states,
obviously
our
laws
were
not
affirmed.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
said
if
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
problem
would
be
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
possibly
you
could
if
you
have
the
people
here
in
this
country,
yes.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
don't
think
i
would
make
any
difference
in
the
results
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
the
contention
is
made
by
the
--
the
respondents
that
even
an
american
corporation
could
charter
a
foreign
ship
and
use
it
and
that
if
the
union
picketed
that
would
be
not
a
labor
dispute
and
therefore
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
not
apply.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
well
the
national
boat
carriers
is
an
american
corporation,
the
sea
tankers
incorporated
is
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
but
sea
tankers
is
a
foreign
corporation
even
though
owned
by
an
american
corporation.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
it
is
the
charter,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
so
that
it
is
a
foreign
corporation,
i
believe
the
liberian
corporation.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
possibly
so
your
honor,
yes.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
whether
this
is
a
case
involving
or
going
out
of
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
if
it
is
we
say
that
act
supplies
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
is
limited,
it
may
not
grant
an
injunction.
and
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
the
intention
of
the
respondents
is
that
because
the
ship
was
a
ship
of
liberian
registry,
it
was
not
--
this
was
not
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
norris-laguardia
act.
we
also
of
course
have
the
second
question
of
whether
the
decision
of
this
court
in
romero
would
prevent
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction
on
their
federal
question
jurisdiction
where
the
claim
is
that
the
conduct
of
the
union
was
a
maritime
towards
under
federal
law.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor
and
if
that
be
true
then
the
case
must
be
reversed.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no
your
honor.
now
before
discussing
the
applicable
law,
i
would
like
to
comment
on
one
matter.
last
saturday
i
read
a
brief
filed
by
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
in
which
they
thought
that
maybe
we
would
challenge
the
liberian
registry
of
the
nikolos.
now
we
do
not
challenge
the
liberian
registry
of
the
nikolos.
we
don't
question
the
liberian
registry
of
the
ship
and
as
we
view
it,
the
liberian
registry
of
this
ship
is
not
controlling
in
the
decision
of
the
case.
so
that
i
think
--
i
think
we
can
place
that
here
at
rest.
we
don't
brace
any
question
as
to
the
liberian
registry
of
the
ship.
now
with
respect
tot
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
was
the
sole
question
your
honor.
they
had
some
letter
from
the
liberia
which
said
“maybe
we
were
going
to
challenge
it”.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no
your
honor.
no,
they're
--
they're
not
concerned
at
all
with
the
other
questions.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
now
the
--
i'm
sure
your
honors
are
familiar
with
the
language
of
section
13
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
i
think
it
fits
the
facts
that
we
have
in
this
case
where
we
see
the
american
union
protesting
what
amounted
to
unfair
competition
resulting
in
loss
of
jobs
to
the
american
union
by
the
use
of
this
foreign
registered
ship
in
this
trade
which
had
formerly
been
occupied
by
american
ships
and
with
the
prospect
as
the
court
found
that
other
foreign
ships
are
going
to
come
in
and
more
jobs
are
going
to
be
lost.
subsection
(a)
of
section
13
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
says
that
a
case
shall
be
held
to
involve
or
to
grow
out
of
a
labor
dispute
when
the
case
involves
persons
who
were
engaged
in
the
same
industry.
industry
here
is
the
same
in
maritime
industry,
transportation
by
sea.
same
industry
trade,
craft,
or
occupation
and
the
occupation
is
the
same.
the
foreign
seaman
on
the
nikolos,
in
effect,
ousted
the
american
seamen
ira
nelson
morris
who
were
working
in
this
trade
so
that
the
trade,
craft,
or
occupation
is
the
same
and
the
union
certainly
has
a
very
direct
interest
in
the
job
to
its
members.
it
is
also
provided
that
a
case
shall
be
held
to
involve
or
grow
out
of
a
labor
dispute,
when
it
involves
any
conflicting
or
competing
interest
in
a
labor
dispute
of
persons
participating
or
interested
therein.
and
we
say
that
this
section
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
also
applies
to
our
case,
but
for
this
additional
reason,
this
is
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
that
act
because
we
have
a
direct
interest
in
the
--
what
this
--
foreign
ship
did
to
the
jobs
of
the
american
seamen
and
subsection
(c)
of
section
13
defines
a
labor
dispute
as
including
any
controversy
concerning
terms
or
conditions
of
employment
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
dispute
can
stand
on
approximate
relation
of
employer
and
employee.
and
of
course,
one
of
the
big
problems
here
is
that
the
foreign
ship
was
operating
with
one-fifth
of
the
wage
cost
of
the
american
ship.
so
that
by
use
of
the
foreign
corporation
the
foreign
sea
tankers
incorporated
was
able
to
make
a
profit
and
to
drive
the
american
ships
out
of
the
trade.
and
the
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
sure
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
think
that
question
has
not
been
argued
your
honor
but
in
my
view
it
would.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
i
would
come
in
to
the
benz
case
later.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
it
might
not
be
except
that
there
is
this
very
difference.
there
is
this
great
difference
between
this
case
and
benz.
in
benz
the
picketing
union
was
picketing
on
behalf
of
the
crew
members
on
a
foreign
ship
in
a
dispute
between
the
foreign
employer
and
the
foreign
crew.
here
they
are
picketing
on
behalf
of
their
own
members.
in
section
7
of
the
taft-hartley
act
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
it
might
apply
to
this
joint.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
we
think
that
--
we
think
the
--
we
are
not
arguing
preemption
problem
here.
we
don't
claim
preemption
at
this
point.
we
say
that
this
is
a
question
only
whether
this
is
a
labor
dispute
and
whether
or
not
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
apply
and
the
language
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
very
clear.
it
says
“no
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
on
a
temporary
injunction
or
any
restraining
order
in
a
labor
dispute
or
the
language
actually
is
in
a
case
involving
or
growing
out
of,
involving
or
growing
out
of
their
labor
dispute
to
prohibit
peaceful
picket
of
the
sort
that
the
union
engaged
in
here
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
again
that
nothing
that
the
union
did
was
anymore
than
a
protest
of
the
bringing
of
this
foreign
ship
in.
they
circled
the
nikolos
and
before
the
nikolos
docked,
the
injunction
was
granted.
so
that
all
we
had
was
the
circling
of
the
nikolos
by
the
willoughby,
the
small
cabin
cruiser.
there
was
no
fraud,
no
violence,
no
nothing.
there
was
not
even
any
contact
between
mr.
willoughby
and
the
crew
of
the
nikolos
except
that
he
spoke
to
the
master
but
he
spoke
to
no
one
else
except
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
think
prior
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
on
the
construction
of
the
courts
gave
the
clayton
that
would
have
been
enjoined
because
the
employer-employee
relationship
was
lacking.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
possibly
so.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
would
be
a
preliminary
question.
that
is
even
without
the
norris-laguardia,
would
this
conduct
be
permissible
and
could
it
be
enjoined
even
aside
from
the
prohibitions
of
norris-laguardia.
i
think
that
their
interference
with
foreign
commerce
has
never
been
considered
to
be
a
tort
as
such.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
yes
i've
come
to
the
romero.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
under
romero
theory,
there
could
not
have
been
--
a
case
could
not
have
been
entertained
at
all.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
well
you
could
entertain
it
on
the
admiralty
side
and
in
that
event
historically,
i
believe,
has
not
granted
an
injunction.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
in
admiralty
the
remedy
would
be
the
regular
admiralty
remedy
of
damages.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no
injunctive
remedy.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
--
i
should
say
the
respondents
counsel
for
the
first
time
argues
in
this
court
that
admiralty
might
have
granted
an
injunction
and
therefore,
this
might
be
sustained
in
that
ground
and
i
will
mention
that
problem
briefly.
now
this
court
as,
your
honors
are
aware
has
not
given
the
norris-laguardia
act
a
narrow
or
restrictive
interpretation.
the
narrow
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
clayton
act
was
removed
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
disputes
of
the
characters
that
we
have
here
where
the
picketing
protests
what
the
union
considers
to
be
unfair
competition
has
been
held
to
involve
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
a
norris-laguardia
act.
the
new
negro
alliance
case
and
most
closely
in
point,
the
milk
wagon
drivers'
union
case
in
which
this
court
considered
the
picketing
by
a
union
which
picketed
retail
outlets
of
dairies
which
used
the
so-called
vendor
system
of
milk
distribution.
that
is
the
dairies
instead
of
employing
their
own
employees
to
deliver
the
milk
used
independent
contractors.
and
the
union
considered
that
the
use
of
the
independent
contractors
depressed
wages
and
conditions
and
prevented
union
employees
from
getting
jobs
and
restricted
the
opportunities,
the
job
opportunities
of
union
members.
this
court
refers
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
had
held
that
no
labor
dispute
existed
there
and
reversed
the
order
granting
the
injunction
holding
that
reading
the
norris-laguardia
act
as
congress
enacted
it
clearly
this
type
of
conduct
constitutes
a
labor
dispute.
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
which
we
say
falls
within
the
express
language
of
norris-laguardia
and
we
believe
that
the
respondents
must
bear
the
burden
of
establishing
that
in
some
fashion,
norris-laguardia
act
should
not
apply
solely
because
a
foreign
ship
was
picketed
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
posture
of
the
case
here.
now
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
sir.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now
in
our
case
the
--
what
the
petitioner
was
doing
was
peacefully
picketing
this
ship
in
protest
against
the
fact
that
this
ship
was
in
a
trade
formerly
occupied
by
an
american
ship
and
the
union
people
are
out
of
work.
so
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
would
say
--
you
mean
whether
we
could
have
had
a
dispute
with
the
people
working
on
the
ship?
mr.
john
paul
jennings
our
dispute
was
with
the
parties
to
this
case,
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
the
charter
sea
tankers
which
had
brought
the
vessel
and
the
employees
were
--
were
just
on
the
vessel
and
they
were
the
instruments,
if
you
wish,
but
they
--
they
had
no
dispute
with
the
employees
on
the
ship.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
i
think
is
what
the
respondents
argue.
they
say
not
--
that
you
may
not
have
a
labor
dispute
with
a
foreigner.
they
recognize
that
a
foreigner,
when
he
becomes
a
litigant
in
an
american
court,
he
is
in
no
different
position
than
in
america.
but
they
say
that
because
these
disputes
involved
a
foreign
registered
vessel,
it
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
i
find
nothing
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
nor
in
any
decisions
of
this
court
which
would
lead
to
such
a
conclusion.
that
is
their
contention.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
it
was
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
american
corporation.
it
is
a
foreign
corporation
liberian.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
don't
know
of
anything
in
the
record
which
would
indicate
that.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
is
true.
so
far
as
the
sea
tankers
is
concerned
the
argument,
as
i
understand
you,
would
be
that
if
as
a
liberian
corporation
might
be
required
to
employ
liberians.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
well
actually
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
well
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
it
isn't
true,
your
honor,
because
we
have
some
liberian
ships
under
contract.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
there
isn't
any
treaty
that
says
anything
about
the
picket
situation
we
have
here.
there
is
a
treaty
part
of
it
which
is
quoted
in
the
respondents'
brief
and
other
sections
in
our
brief
treaty
of
commerce,
friendship
and
so
forth
which
gives
liberian
vessels
the
same
rights
in
our
courts
that
american
vessels
have
in
liberian
ports.
and
they
have
the
same
right
to
go
to
court
of
justice
in
this
country
that
americans
have
to
go
to
court
in
this
country.
they
don't
get
any
greater
right,
they
have
the
same.
they
have
the
same
right
as
american
ships
and
they
have
the
same
rights
in
our
american
courts,
but
no
difference.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
no
great.
they
aren't
given
any
--
any
more
rights.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
well
that's
what
the
treaty
says.
there
are
reciprocal
obligations.
in
our
court
say,
they
get
the
same
treatment
as
our
ships
and
it
says
in
their
ports
that
our
ships
get
the
same
treatment
as
theirs.
now
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
the
case
in
which
an
american
union
is
enjoined
for
exercising
its
right
to
protest
peacefully
what
was
unfair
competition
to
its
membership
and
it
should
be
recalled
that
in
this
case,
although
the
respondents
denied
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
this
dispute
and
that
is
a
federal
law,
their
entire
case
before
this
court
is
predicated
upon
the
theory
that
what
we
did,
the
peaceful
picketing,
was
a
maritime
tort
under
federal
law
and
they
predicate
their
entire
claim
of
jurisdiction
upon
the
ground
that
this
is
federal
question
of
jurisdiction.
that
this
is
a
case
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
that
they
are
in
a
difficult
logical
position
in
maintaining
that
they
have
so
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned
and
so
far
as
the
establishment
of
a
maritime
tort
is
concerned,
reliance
upon
american
law,
upon
federal
law,
but
denied
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
there
are
a
few
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
of
what
normally
would
be
considered
to
be
a
labor
dispute,
it
is
not
a
labor
dispute
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
some
of
those
cases.
in
the
united
mine
workers'
case
which
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
is
the
only
case
in
which
a
statute,
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
not
applied
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
parties
involved.
the
court
said
that
a
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
its
own
employees
who
became
the
employees
of
the
united
states
when
the
government
took
over
the
mines
was
not
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
the
reasons
which
have
impelled
this
court
to
hold
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
did
not
apply
to
the
united
states
of
sovereign
certainly
do
not
apply
here.
there
is
another
line
of
cases
in
which
the
norris-laguardia
act
has
not
been
applied
and
in
those
cases,
what
this
court
said
was
that
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
the
only
one
of
several
statutes
which
governed
and
the
mandate
of
the
other
statute
requires
certain
conduct,
the
norris-laguardia
act
will
not
stand
in
the
way
of
an
injunction
enforcing
the
mandate
of
the
other
statute.
for
the
example
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
were
interpreted
to
forbid
discrimination
and
this
court
enforcing
that
policy
granted
--
approved
an
injunction
which
enforced
the
mandate
of
those
statutes.
this
court
also
in
the
textile
workers'
case
enforced
the
mandate
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
required
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
contracts
and
suits
to
enforce
and
approved
an
order
directing
what
amounted
to
compulsory
arbitration
under
the
provisions
of
an
agreement
in
which
the
union
agreed
to
arbitrate
the
grievance.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yet
it
says
that
norris-laguardia
is
modified
only
to
the
extent
of
permitting
the
national
labor
relations
board
itself
to
go
into
a
federal
court
and
secure
an
injunction.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
in
any
case
involving
the
claim
of
violation
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
only
the
national
labor
relations
board
can
secure
an
injunction.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
now
as
i
say
the
problem
here
is
to
interpret
the
intention
of
congress
in
this
court
in
the
cases
that
i
have
referred
to
has
said
where
there
is
a
congressional
mandate
which
looks
in
a
particular
direction;
this
court
will
enforce
that
mandate
despite
the
prohibitions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
i
have
searched
in
vain
for
any
mandate
which
says
that
a
foreign
registered
vessel
is
to
be
treated
any
differently
in
the
case
under
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
american
vessel
or
that
a
foreign
registered
vessel
is
to
be
given
any
rights
which
an
american
vessel
doesn't
have.
that
the
--
if
there's
any
test
at
all
that
the
nationality
of
the
registration
of
the
vessel
has
anything
to
do
with
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
is
correct.
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
now
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
a
very
--
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
but
the
rights
there
were
the
rights
of
a
foreign
seaman
on
a
foreign
ship.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
correct
but
again
the
jones
act
is
a
--
an
act
creating
substantive
rights.
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
a
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
correct
and
it
certainly
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
(inaudible)
case
would
have
been
improper.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
well,
that's
one
thing
but
in
the
--
in
that
case
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
correct,
your
honor
but
may
i
point
out
that
in
that
case,
if
the
seaman
had
been
able
to
get
a
remedy
in
this
court
for
that
tort,
he
might
have
gotten
the
difference
or
a
greater
remedy
than
it
could
have
been
--
he
sued
in
the
courts
of
his
own
nation,
and
here
we
are
not
troubled
with
that
point
at
all
because
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
well
i
was
going
to
state,
your
honor,
that
that
is
precisely
correct.
we
don't
say
that
we
might
not
be
responsible
in
tort
damages
if
what
we
did
was
wrong.
well
at
least
it
was
not
before
the
court
here.
the
question
is
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
forbad
in
injunction.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
suppose
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
know
that
an
american
shipowner
who
might
be
picketed
in
the
foreign
court
in
liberian
court
will
get
an
injunction,
maybe
he
could
get
damages
but
i
don't
think
the
injunctive
remedy
in
labor
disputes
is
universally
applied.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
so
far
as
labor
dispute
is
concerned,
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
as
to
the
jurisdiction,
it
would
be
the
same.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
our
argument
would
be
the
same
because
we
said
the
burden
is
on
the
other
side
to
show
that
because
a
foreign
registered
ship
is
involved
you
apply
a
different
rule.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
correct.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
but
i
would
say
that
the
american
shipowner
obviously
could
not
obtain
an
injunction
in
this
case
so
what
it
amounts
to
is
a
claim
that
the
american
competitor
of
this
foreign
ship
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
--
could
not
obtain
an
injunction.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no.
we
think
so
far
as
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
concerned,
so
far
as
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
it
could
very
well
your
honor
except
that
i
find
no
—
no
way
that
you
can't
find
a
way
out
of
the
norris-laguardia
problem,
it
seems
to
be
explicit.
it
makes
no
exception
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
they
did
it
upon
the
basis,
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
they
did
it
solely
upon
the
ground
of
the
benz
case
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
and
this
is
the
distinction
between
this
case.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
in
the
benz
case,
this
court
held
that
a
damage
action
for
what
was
a
tort
under
the
law
of
oregon
was
not
preempted
by
the
remedy
presumably
provided
by
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
case
there
was
a
damage
action,
an
action
for
damages.
here
we
have
an
action
for
an
injunction.
the
claim
there
was
a
diversity
case
based
on
state
law
and
here
we
have
a
claim
based
exclusively
on
federal
law
with
jurisdiction
indicated
on
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
dispute
in
the
benz
case
was
between
the
foreign
crew
and
the
foreign
owners.
it
was
internal
to
the
ship.
here
the
dispute
is
between
an
american
union
and
two
foreign
corporations
which
seek
to
bring
a
foreign
ship
into
this
trade
and
to
the
union
members
of
their
jobs.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
we
felt
that
the
--
the
foreign
shipowner
could
bring
his
vessel
in,
in
this
trade
which
was
historically
american
and
that
the
trade
would
be
lost
entirely
to
american
employers
because
they
paid
five
times
as
much.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
and
the
--
the
business
is
gone
and
we
think
that
we
have
the
right
to
make
that
protest.
now,
may
i
point
out
also
that
in
our
case
the
union
picketed
on
behalf
of
its
own
members
and
in
the
benz
case,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
decision,
the
union
picketed
on
behalf
of
the
foreign
crewmen
in
a
dispute
of
the
foreign
crewmen
with
the
foreign
employer.
that
dispute
was
internal
to
the
economy
of
the
vessel,
our
dispute
is
not.
that
dispute,
this
court
said
involved
interference
with
the
internal
economy
of
the
vessel
and
the
court
felt
that
if
the
representation
procedures
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
other
procedures
of
the
taft-hartley
act
were
applied
to
the
internal
economy
of
the
foreign
vessel
that
that
would
be,
as
i
believe
the
court
said,
running
interference
in
a
very
delicate
field
of
international
relations,
but
we
do
not
have
any
problem
of
the
internal
economy
of
this
vessel.
the
dispute
did
not
concern
relations
between
the
foreign
crew
and
the
foreign
employers,
the
dispute
was
external.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
we
were
complaining
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
not
the
leaving
conditions
your
honor.
the
complaint
was
that
the
conditions
which
existed
on
this
ship
were
substandard
that
this
was
one-fifth
of
the
wages
paid
on
american
ships
which
in
effect
was
unfair
competition.
that
the
—
as
i
told
you
the
picket
signs
that
we
broadcast,
the
use
of
foreign
vessels
with
substandard
wages
and
substandard
conditions
—-
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no
your
honor.
that
was
involved
in
the
benz
case
but
it
was
not
involved
here.
that
was
solely
that
it
was
one
of
the
problems
in
the
benz
case
not
here.
now
in
the
benz
case,
the
court
held
that
the
taft-hartley
procedures
did
not
apply
to
resolve
the
dispute
which
was
internal
to
the
vessel.
in
our
case
we
say
that
the
situation
is
entirely
different.
we're
talking
about
a
statute
which
limits
the
jurisdiction
of
a
united
states
district
court.
we,
therefore,
urge
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
prevented
granting
of
the
injunctions.
now
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
we
think
that
the
romero
case
is
precisely
in
point.
here
as
there
the
plaintiff
wants
a
remedy
which
he
doesn't
think
he
can
get
in
admiralty.
in
the
romero
case,
he
wanted
to
sue
on
a
civil
side
claiming
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
to
get
a
jury
trial.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
jennings.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
mr.
chief
justice,
if
your
honors
please.
i
would
like
to
clarify
one
matter
which
is
in
nature
of
its
dispute
that
we
have
here.
we
have
issued
all
intent
to
interfere
anyway
with
the
internal
economy
of
this
ship.
we
realize
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
benz
case
and
we
could
not
represent
or
seek
to
represent
these
foreign
seamen
or
to
bargain
for
them.
the
position
of
the
union
is
best
expressed
in
the
picket
sign
which
was
used
on
board
the
willoughby,
as
it
circled
the
nikolos.
the
afl-cio
seamen
protest
loss
of
their
employment,
because
of
the
use
of
foreign
flagships
employing
seamen
at
substandard
wages.
that
was
the
nature
of
the
protest.
the
dispute
could
have
been
settled
in
a
variety
of
ways.
the
record
indicates
that
mr.
schultz,
who
was
the
assistant
operating
manager
of
national
boat
carriers
also
he's
the
assistant
operating
manager
of
transea
and
of
seatankers
which
is
a
respondent
in
this
case,
so
that
these
american
corporations
are
closely
related
in
seatankers.
seatankers
was
the
agency
which
selected
the
nikolos
to
use
in
this
trade.
and
necessarily,
we
hope
that
the
economic
pressure
which
we
used
could
influence
seatankers,
perhaps,
to
change
its
mind.
and
certainly
if
the
only
reason
for
employment
of
a
foreign
ship
is
that
the
wages,
hours
and
conditions
on
that
ship,
are
one-fifth
of
those
on
american
ship,
but
that
reason
disappears
and
american
ship
would
be
used,
so
that
the
conditions
on
the
nikolos
were
important
with
the
union.
they
existed
as
conditions.
the
conditions
work
that
the
wages
were
one-fifth
of
those
on
these
american
ship.
but
this
was
a
fact
which
existed
when
seatankers
procured
the
nikolos
to
enter
the
salt
trade.
so
that
that
is
the
nature
of
the
dispute
and
we
think
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
apply
to
it.
there
are
other
problems
mr.
mosser
suggested
that
if
we
picketed
a
railroad
company
that
that
might
be
within
the
protection
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
but
obviously
it
would
not,
because
the
industry
would
be
different.
the
trade,
craft
and
occupation
would
be
different.
we
would
not
be
in
the
same
industry.
it
would
be
a
different
industry
and
norris-laguardia
would
not
apply.
we
think
that
a
case
more
closely
analogous
would
be
a
case
in
which,
for
example,
in
american
longshore
union
would
picket
in
a
--
in
american
port
to
protest
the
use
of
foreign
non
union
longshoremen
on
the
--
american
joined
the
foreign
ship
unloading
the
ship.
or
if,
for
example,
an
american
shipowner
during
the
course
of
a
maritime
strike,
should
use
a
foreign
registered
vessel,
which
he
might
even
know
in
a
trade
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
struck
ships
so
as
to
break
the
strike.
or,
if
an
american
shipowner
and
there
are
some
operating
foreign
ships
under
american
contract,
should
have
the
termination
of
the
contract
say,
i
won't
bargain
any
further
and
the
union
would
be
told
of
--
if
you
put
up
a
picket
line
and
try
to
strike,
the
norris-laguardia
act
will
not
prevent
an
injunction
at
the
behest
of
the
american
shipowner.
we
think
those
are
cases
more
closely
analogous
to
the
present
one.
now,
there
was
one
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
the
other
day
with
respect
to
the
possibility
that
on
this
foreign
ship,
it
might
be
considered
a
little
piece
of
liberia
in
the
port
of
tacoma.
that
problem
was
dealt
with
in
the
case
of
scharrenberg
against
the
dollar
steamship
company,
in
which
mr.
justice
clark
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court.
that's
at
245
u.s.
122
at
page
127,
decided
in
1917.
mr.
justice
clark
said
this,
“it
is,
of
course,
true
that
for
the
purposes
of
jurisdiction
a
ship,
even
on
the
high
seas
as
often
said
to
be
a
part
of
the
territory
of
the
nation
whose
flag
it
flies.”
but
in
the
physical
sense,
this
expression
is
obviously
figurative.
quoting,
international
law
digest,
moore,
vol.
i
section
174,
“and
to
expand
the
doctrine
to
the
extent
of
treating
seamen
employed
on
such
a
ship
as
working
in
the
country
of
its
registry
is
quite
impossible.”
and
the
case
was
quoted
with
approval
by
this
court
in
the
cunard
steamship
company
case.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
was
a
case,
your
honor,
in
which
it
was
maintained
that
the
employment
of
a
foreign
seaman
on
an
american
vessel
in
a
foreign
port
constituted
use
of
foreign
labor
importation
of
foreign
labor
into
this
country
in
violation
of
the
statute
forbidding
it.
the
chinese
seaman
had
been
employed
on
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
john
paul
jennings
he
was
a
chinese
citizen.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
he
was
employed
under
an
american
ship
in
a
foreign
port.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
whether
that
amounted
to
employment
in
american
territory
because
the
ship
was
to
be
treated
as
american
as
an
extension
of
american
sovereignty.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
and
this
court
said
not.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
think
not,
your
honor.
the
--
the
courts
have
uniformly
recognized
that
the
sovereign
of
the
territory
in
which
the
ship
is
even
though
it
be
a
foreign
ship,
may
exercise
jurisdiction,
but
as
a
matter
of
comity,
they
normally
do
not,
if
it
involves
inner
--
internal
relations,
relations
between
the
--
the
members
of
the
crew
and
the
foreign
government.
so
the
result
is
if
it's
a
minor
crime,
normally,
we
do
not
exercise
jurisdiction.
if
it's
a
major
crime,
we
do.
and
for
example,
the
prohibition
act
was
applied
to
foreign
ships
when
they
entered
american
courts.
that
was
the
cunard
case.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
wanted
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
in
conclusion
and
we
think
that
the
benz
case
in
this
court,
which
i
think
is
a
case
relied
on
principally
by
mr.
mosser,
is
not
controlling
in
this
litigation
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
apply
and
that
the
injunction
was
improvidently
granted.
we
urge
also
that
in
any
event,
the
jurisdiction
did
not
exist
below
and
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
the
respondents
here
were
not
relying
upon
section
13
--
1333
because
it
is
stated
in
the
majority
opinion
at
page
143,
“appellee,"
that
is
a
respondent
here,
"has
also
refrained
from
invoking
jurisdiction
on
the
admiralty
side
under
28
u.s.c.
1333."
this
position
may
have
been
dictated
by
the
inability
--
unavailability
of
a
jury
trial
on
the
damages
in
the
admiralty
and
because
of
appellee's
belief
that
admiralty
cannot
afford
injunctive
relief
so
that
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
--
the
court
felt
that
they
were
not
relying
on
section
1333.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that,
if
this
be
a
maritime
tort
at
all
and
we
don't
think
it
has
been
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
--
established
that
it
is.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
if
it
be
a
maritime
tort,
it
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
admiralty
and
that
in
that
event,
the
choice
is
either
to
sue
an
admiralty
in
which
event,
there
is
no
injunction
or
to
sue
one
at
savings
clause
in
the
state
court
where
you
may
procure
an
injunction.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
it
is
in
admiralty,
your
honor,
but
the
remedy
of
injunction
is
unavailable.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
admiralty
would
have
no
power.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
was
because,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
we
felt
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
applies
in
the
conduct
of
the
--
the
union
in
picketing,
it
was
protected
by
the
provisions
of
the
clayton
act
and
therefore,
it
was
perfectly
lawful.
that
was
the
reason.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
no,
your
honor,
only
the
conduct
of
the
union
here
which
was
only
peaceful
patrolling
and
no
more
than
that.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
that
--
mr.
john
paul
jennings
i
--
i
would
say
that
it
is
protected
by
the
language
of
section
104
(e).
mr.
john
paul
jennings
not
because
you
can't
get
an
injunction.
mr.
john
paul
jennings
yes,
your
honor.
