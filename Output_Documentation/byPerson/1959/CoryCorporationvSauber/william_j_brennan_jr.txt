j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
understand
you,
mr.
rothschild,
that
the
purposes
of
the
tax,
if
the
tax
is
exacted
it,
it's
under
1
horsepower.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
if
it's
1
horsepower
precisely
or
more,
then
there's
no
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
did
household
type
get
into
this,
it's
a
regulation?
i
understood
you
to
say
the
statute
is
self-contained
air
conditioning
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
says
nothing
about
horsepower
rating.
it
says
nothing
about
household
or
other
type,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
the
government
position
now,
that
it
--
there's
no
limitation
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
horsepower
or
household
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
way
we
can
have
you
fellows
start
this
thing
all
over
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i've
never
seen
this,
by
this
confusing
case
that's
up
in
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying,
mr.
heffron,
we
could
not
authorize
him
to
amend
that
claim
of
refund
if
that's
so
important
in
order
to
set
up
the
facts
which
would
bring
him
within
the
right
to
a
statutory
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
could
do
that,
couldn't
he,
as
to
the
50,000
units?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
means
this
case
is
done.
