justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
got
a
little
different
impression,
maybe
all
wrong,
but
i
understood
your
case
was
something
different,
namely,
forget
all
about
the
stipulation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
the
position
was
that
here,
you
have
a
broad
ambiguous
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
here,
you
also
have
a
longstanding
government
regulation
and
that
the
court
of
appeals,
forgetting
all
about
the
stipulation,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
business
disregarding
that
regulation
and
saying
that
a
horsepower
was
immaterial
and
therefore
that
the
case
ought
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
try
out
the
one
issue
that
remains,
namely,
whether
there
was
government
regulation
means
rated
or
nominal
horsepower.
now,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
stipulations
or
estoppels
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
or
anything
else,
am
i
wrong?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
horsepower
is
an
irrelevant
factor.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
we
let
us
put
it
less
politely.
what
the
commissioner
is
saying
is
that
he
is
repudiating
his
own
regulation
because
he
now
considered
it
to
be
invalid,
is
that
fair?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he's
had
a
regulation
with
regards
to
horsepower
as
rightly
wrong.
he
specifies
horsepower
as
being
a
factor
in
the
application
of
this
tax.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
he
is
walking
away
from
the
regulation
saying
it's
invalid.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
taking
--
taking
your
premises
what
you
just
said
and
assuming
that
you
were
held
that
the
regulation
was
valid,
would
the
position
of
this
case
be
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
try
out
the
issue
as
to
whether
a
nominal
or
actual
horsepower
was
a
testing
to
the
regulation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
regulation
is
a
valid
regulation
despite
the
government's
present
position,
then
would
not
the
proper
disposition
be
to
send
this
case
back
for
determination
as
to
the
dispute
between,
namely,
whether
it's
actual
horsepower
or
nominal
horsepower
that
the
regulation
refers
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
we
can't
determine
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
for
the
lower
court
to
determine
that
issue.
it
was
never
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
they
said
horsepower
was
an
irrelevancy
and
that
the
regulation
was
invalid.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
understand
that.
