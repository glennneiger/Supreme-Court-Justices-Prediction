mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
oh,
i
think
it
--
it
may
present
the
issue
of
how
do
you
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
say
may
because
i
think
there
are
alternative
issues
here.
one
of
which
may
be
reached.
and
if
it
is
reached,
the
other
need
not
be.
but
i
will
present
both
issues.
first,
what
does
the
ruling
mean
when
it
says
total
motor
horsepower
of
one
or
more
exempts
from
tax
or
conversely
that
a
total
motor
horsepower
of
less
than
one
qualifies
for
tax.
what
does
total
motor
horsepower
mean
in
terms
of
the
various
possible
standards
which
maybe
conceived
of
in
measuring
the
horsepower
of
a
motor
used
in
an
air
conditioner?
now,
there
are
several
alternatives.
one
alternative
is
engineering
horsepower.
you
take
the
motor,
you
use
predetermined
test
conditions,
you
make
various
measurements,
and
you
compute
horsepower
mathematically.
another
method
is
to
look
at
a
little
metal
plate
which
appears
on
the
compressor
itself
which
is
what
the
air
conditioner
manufacturer
receives.
that
metal
plate
has
a
designation
horsepower.
in
this
case,
that
metal
plate
reached
three-quarter
horsepower.
so
we're
faced
first
with
the
question
of
which
of
these
two
possibilities
is
referred
to
in
the
ruling?
then
we
reach
the
second
question,
in
our
view,
only
if
the
construction
of
the
ruling
is
resolved
in
favor
of
that
set
forth
by
the
air
conditioner
manufacturer,
that
is
if
the
ruling
is
construed
to
refer
in
terms
of
motor
horsepower
to
the
engineering
horsepower,
we
have
here
admittedly
air
conditioning
units
whose
motors
exceed
1
horsepower.
therefore,
under
that
interpretation
of
the
rulings,
they
would
be
exempt
from
the
tax.
the
next
question
which
is
presented
is,
if
these
rulings
are
to
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
exempt
these
units
from
the
tax,
are
they
valid
under
the
statute
or
are
they,
as
the
government
contends,
inconsistent
with
the
statute
and
void
because
there
is
no
rational
connection
between
self-contained
air
conditioning
units
which
is
the
only
language
in
the
statute
and
engineering
horsepower?
now,
those
are
the
two
issues.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
say
that
the
rulings
refer
to
the
so-called
nominal
horsepower.
and
we
say
that
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
in
the
fist
place,
the
tax
is
imposed
upon
the
manufacturer
of
the
air
conditioning
unit.
now,
the
manufacturer
buys
a
compressor
from
a
compressor
manufacturer
and
it
uses
it
in
the
assembly
of
the
finished
unit.
the
compressor
which
he
receives
has
a
little
metal
plate
on
it
which
designates
the
horsepower.
now,
the
compressor
manufacturer
didn't
--
doesn't
dream
that
horsepower
up
out
of
thin
air.
he
receives
the
horsepower
from
the
motor
manufacturer.
the
manufacturer
of
the
motor
determines
the
horsepower
to
designate
for
this
motor.
he
informs
the
compressor
manufacturer.
the
compressor
manufacturer
then
puts
a
metal
plate
on
his
motor
and
calls
it
as,
in
this
case,
a
three-quarter
horsepower
compressor.
the
air
conditioning
manufacturer
receives
the
compressor
and
he
then
designates
it
as
a
three-quarter
horsepower
air
conditioning
unit.
he
relies
wholly
upon
the
plate
horsepower
which
he
receives
as
counsel
for
the
air
conditioner
manufacturer
conceded
below
at
page
105
of
the
record.
the
compressor
manufacturer
takes
the
same
rating
and
puts
it
on
a
plaque
on
the
outside
of
the
housing.
and
if
you
are
going
to
sell
an
air
conditioner
with
that
compressor
in
it,
you
can't
very
well
sell
it
for
something
other
than
the
rating
the
compressor
manufacturer
puts
on
it.
now,
we're
taxing
air
conditioning
manufacturers
not
motor
manufacturers.
the
air
conditioning
manufacturer
is
not
concerned
with
the
motor.
he's
not
concerned
with
the
specifications.
he
doesn't
test
the
motor.
he
doesn't
have
access
to
the
specifications
under
which
the
motor
are
tested
from
which
you
could
compute
the
horsepower
in
an
engineering
set.
he's
not
concerned
with
that
because
he
relies
upon
the
compressor
manufacturer
who
furnishes
him
a
finished
compressor
which
embodies
the
(inaudible).
this
compressor
is
adapted
to
the
air
conditioning
requirements
of
the
air
conditioner
manufacturer.
so
if
we're
looking
for
a
test,
which
the
internal
revenue
service
was
here
concerned
with
which
would
be
ease
of
application
which
would
permit
certainty
when
the
air
conditioning
manufacturer
who,
after
all,
self-assesses
the
excise
tax,
the
simplest
thing,
which
was
apparent
to
the
commissioner
at
the
time,
was
to
tell
the
air
conditioning
manufacturer,
“well,
look
at
the
plaque
on
the
compressor.
and
if
it
says
it
is
less
than
one,
collect
the
tax
from
your
vendee.
if
it
says
it
is
an
excess
of
one,
you
need
not
collect
the
tax
from
your
vendee.”
now,
that
is
the
issue
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
the
ruling.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
you
could
give
an
answer
to
the
question
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
with
respect
to
the
record
in
this
case.
the
term
“self-contained”
may
be
ambiguous
but
not
with
respect
to
its
application
to
the
units
in
question
here.
we
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
not
in
our
view.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
no,
i
--
i
say
--
we
say
that
the
term
“self-contained
air
conditioning
unit”
in
this
statute
as
applied
to
the
air
conditioning
units,
which
are
the
subject
of
this
suit
which
have
the
characteristics
described
in
the
stipulation
of
fact,
are
clearly
taxable.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
in
the
first
place,
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
i
would
say
this,
and
i
think
this
--
may
i
answer
how
would
you
know
it
were
household
type
if
you
considered
yourself
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
will
not
refer
to
it
again.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
statute
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
together
with
the
pertinent
facts,
which
are
set
forth
in
the
stipulation,
it
is
stipulated,
for
example,
that
the
air
conditioning
units
in
issue
here
are
encased
in
a
single
assembly
that
they
incorporate
within
this
assembly
all
the
means
for
dehumidifying
and
cooling
an
enclosure
that
they
can
be
installed
in
front
of
a
window
or
other
opening.
in
other
words,
all
the
factual
characteristics
necessary,
whatever
self-contained
air
conditioning
unit
may
mean
in
a
peripheral
case,
for
example,
where
there
are
accessories
needed,
whatever
it
may
mean
in
that
sort
of
case,
that
issue
is
not
presented
here
because
every
characteristic,
which
anyone
could
rationally
ascribe
to
a
self-contained
air
conditioning
unit,
is
evidenced
by
the
record
in
this
case
as
applicable
in
these
units.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i'm
saying
the
minimum
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
the
minimum
area,
the
minimum
area,
which
you
could
ascribe
to
coverage
by
this
language,
would
be
a
unit
which
is
complete
within
itself
and
these
units
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
say
this,
that
if
the
ruling
is
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
you're
talking
about
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
you
refer,
your
honor
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
say
the
horsepower
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
say
that
the
horse
power
test
in
actual
horsepower
terms
or
in
any
terms
for
that
matter
is
not
rationally
connected
with
the
statute.
what
the
commissioner
was
looking
for
here
was
simply
a
--
a
symbol
of
all
the
characteristics
necessary
which
would
be
easy
for
air
conditioning
manufacturers
to
use
in
self-assessing
the
tax.
now
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
your
honor
is
referring
to
subdivision
(c).
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
your
--
your
honor
is
now
referring
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
as
a
result
of
this
litigation
and
the
cloud
cast
over
the
administration
of
this
statute
by
this
very
suit,
the
commission
had
determined
that
he
would've
--
he
would
scuttle
these
rulings
all
together.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
he
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
did
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
--
he
scuttled
--
well,
he
scuttled
the
rulings
in
terms
of
horsepower.
you
don't
need
horsepower.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
has
in
scuttling
the
rulings
and
announcing
a
new
test
which
would
--
that
is
not
dependent
upon
horsepower
at
all.
the
commissioner
determined
that
he
would
not
make
the
application
of
the
new
test
retroactive.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
that
is
all
that
the
reference
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
means.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
this
fact
that
the
statute
speaks
with
clarity
with
respect
to
units
of
the
kind
in
issue
here
which
have
the
characteristics
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
but
in
the
state
of
the
industry
as
it
exist,
there
are
peripheral
problems
with
respect
to
the
larger
units
which
require
water
lines
to
be
connected
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
--
nothing
of
the
kind
is
present
in
this
suit.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
it
is
appropriate.
i
would
draw
the
conclusion
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
commissioner
has
determined
he
will
not
use
a
horsepower
test
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
of
any
kind
in
connection
with
the
statute.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that's
our
position
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
units
which
have
a
high
enough
horsepower,
i
suppose,
that
they
might
require
auxiliary
equipment.
but
this
one,
i
refer
to
when
i
say
that
the
horsepower
test
is
not
rationally
connected
with
the
statute
unless,
under
the
state
of
the
industry,
the
horsepower
test
in
fact
results
in
dividing
self-contained
from
non-self-contained
units.
and
the
state
of
this
record
demonstrates
the
horsepower
test
does
nothing
of
the
kind
with
respect
to
the
units
in
issue
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
might
in
appropriate
cases.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
believe
it
could
not.
we
believe
that
is
why
the
commissioner
of
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
these
are
self-contained
units.
there
may
be
larger
units
which
would
be
used
in
retail
stores.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
may
be
larger
ones
used
in
retail
stores
which
are
contained
with
all
components
in
the
same
casing,
simply
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
this
case
presents
a
--
a
special
problem
in
that
respect
because
it
does
involve
the
excise
tax.
and
there
is
a
special
statutory
provision
which
protects
manufacturers
from
the
imposition
of
the
excise
tax
retroactively
in
cases
where
they
relied.
i
mean,
we're
dealing
here
with
manufacturers
who
are
producing
thousands
of
units.
they
self-assessed
the
tax.
they
collected
from
their
vendee.
they
need
an
easy
test
which
they
can
use
to
determine
what
is
taxable
and
what
is
not
because
if
they
sell
that
unit
without
collecting
the
tax,
they
sell
an
irreparable
damage.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
now
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
would
conceive
that
under
the
statute,
if
they
could
show
that
they
had
relied,
they
would
not
be
liable.
and
the
government
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
now,
the
government,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
conceded
at
the
trial
that
this
ruling
was
ambiguous.
and
so,
you
--
the
stage
was
set.if
the
taxpayer
was
to
make
this
contention,
every
invitation
was
extended
to
him.
will
you
contend
that
i
--
i
looked
at
your
ruling?
i
resolved
the
ambiguity
in
favor
of
non-taxability.
this
was
a
rational,
reasonable
conclusion.
i
sold
these
units.
i
did
not
collect
the
tax.
now,
it
is
unfair
for
the
government
to
attempt
to
assess
over
$2
million
worth
of
excised
taxes.
i
can't
collect
it
from
my
vendees
anymore.
that
would've
been
a
simple
way
of
resolving
this
case,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it's
only
in
the
case
in
the
sense
that
the
taxpayer
has
never
made
that
contention
and
has
never
showed
that
he
did
not
collect
the
tax
from
the
vendees.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
is
not
in
the
case
and
this
court
can
regard
the
question
of
retroactivity
is
out
of
the
case.
this
taxpayer
is
not
in
the
position
where
he
suffered
irreparable
damage.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
taxpayer,
by
failing
to
assert
that
he
did
not
collect
the
tax,
we
believe
the
conclusion
is
unmistakable.
the
tax
was
collected
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
so
that
this
is
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
precisely,
because
the
taxpayer
has
not
relied
upon
the
rulings
with
--
with
all
the
talk
in
his
brief
of
an
unbroken
line
of
administrative
practice
which
would
exempt
these
units
from
tax
with
this
blatant
assumption
throughout
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
the
stipulation
simply
assume
the
language
of
the
ruling
itself
but
it
does
not
resolve
the
ambiguity.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
but
no,
i
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
stipulation
simply
refers
to
the
language
of
the
ruling.
it
does
not
purport
to
resolve
the
issue
of
how
you
construe
the
ruling.
it
simply
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
has
consistently
held
that
an
air
conditioning
unit
which
has
a
total
motor
horsepower
of
1
horsepower.
the
question
is,
what
does
total
motor
horsepower
mean?
now,
that
stipulation
does
not
purport
to
resolve
that
question.
it
simply
says
whatever
the
practice
has
been,
it
has
been
consistent.
the
issue
was,
what
does
total
motor
horsepower
mean?
now,
with
all
the
taxpayer's
assertions
that
there's
been
an
unbroken
consistent
line
of
administrative
practice
which
would
exempt
units
of
this
character
from
the
tax,
he
is
unable
to
make
the
assertion
that
he
relied
on
such
an
unbroken
line
of
administrative
practice
and
did
not
collect
the
tax.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
would
be
no
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
and
he
has
never
made
that
claim
at
any
stage
in
these
proceedings.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
under
--
under
the
statute,
one
who
sues
for
refund
with
respect
to
excise
tax
is
required
to
show
as
follow.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
this
is
page
50
of
the
government's
brief
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
section
6416.
it
says,
"no
credit
or
refund
of
any
tax,
of
any
excise
tax
shall
be
allowed
unless
the
person
who
paid
the
tax
establishes,
one,
that
he
is
not
included
the
tax
in
the
price
of
the
article
or
service."
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
now,
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
--
this
issue
is
not
--
is
not
with
respect
to
the
taxpayer's
money.
this
is
not
the
manufacturer's
money
which
is
in
issue
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
these
are
dollars
which
he
collected
from
vendees.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
but
my
--
my
point
simply
was,
mr.
justice,
that
the
taxpayer
had
he
been
relying
upon
an
estoppel
doctrines
here
that
he
did
fail
to
collect
the
tax
because
of
the
ruling.
he
would
have
been
in
the
position
to
assert
that
he
has
not
included
the
tax.
now,
he
did
not
make
that
assertion.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he's
had
an
opportunity
in
the
district
court.
this
is
an
excise
tax.
and
the
way
you
contest
the
validity
of
excise
tax
exactions
is
by
refund
suits.
now,
he
was
furnished
with
a
proposed
assessment
from
the
treasury
department.
he
had
every
opportunity
there
to
raise
this
issue.
failing
that,
he
paid
the
tax
and
he
sues
for
refund
here
and
his
claim
for
refund
would
be
the
appropriate
place
to
indicate
the
basis
upon
which
he
seeks
a
return
of
this
tax.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
there
will
be
no
doubling
because
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
(inaudible).
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
but
he
will
have
paid
it
over
to
the
government
as
the
basis
for
his
suit
for
refund
with
respect
to
the
two
units
in
issue
here.
he
collected
the
tax
from
the
vendees.
he
then
paid
that
tax
to
the
united
states
and
sues
for
refund.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
gets
that
back,
but
it
is
a
windfall
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
his
money.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
--
that
is
correct.
now,
that
is
why
we
say
there
is
no
issue
of
estoppel
or
retroactivity
here.
this
court
is
free
to
regard
this
case
as
if
it
were
coming
up
here
without
any
change
of
position
and
just
determined
on
the
merits
whether
or
not
this
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
those
units
have
been
sold.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
--
that
is
the
respect
in
which
this
is
a
test
case.
the
taxpayer
stipulated
that
he
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
if
he
has
paid
the
tax
--
if
he
had
to,
that
--
that
is
not
in
issue
here.
in
fact,
the
only
tax
which
has
been
paid
to
the
government
is
that
on
two
units,
they're
$29
in
change
actually
in
issue
on
the
complaint
in
this
action.
the
action
is
a
test
case
in
that
it
has
been
stipulated
that
decision
is
to
whether
these
two
units
are
taxable
will
control
the
50,000
other
units
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
which
have
been
sold.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
say,
if
he
has
not
collected
the
tax,
he
has
a
special
statutory
basis
to
urge
that
you
may
not
now
change
the
rules
on
me.
i
didn't
collect
the
tax
relying
on
your
ruling.you
can't
now
change
that
and
say
you
should
have
collected
the
tax.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that's
the
revenue
act
of
1926
which
is
at
page
44
of
government's
brief.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
a
general
provision
relating
to
conditions
for
suits
for
refund
of
excise
taxes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
he
has
--
the
only
issue
which
has
ever
been
in
this
case
from
the
outset,
the
only
issue
presented
by
the
claim
for
refund
here
by
the
complaint,
by
the
stipulation
of
fact
by
the
district
judge's
findings
has
been
one
issue
and
one
only
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
rulings
exempt
the
taxpayers'
units
from
the
tax,
and
if
they
do,
are
they
valid?
are
they
consistent
with
the
statute?
that
is
the
only
issue
the
taxpayer
in
his
claim
for
refund
limits
himself
to
that
single
ground
and
makes
no
other
contention
of
the
nature
that
has
been
discussed
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
the
taxpayers'
counsel
in
response
to
an
answer
stated
he
had
collected
the
tax
with
respect
to
the
two
units
in
issue
here.
he
has
stipulated
that
these
two
units
are
test
units
to
determine
the
applicability
of
the
statute
to
all
of
his
other
units.
he
has,
at
no
time,
raised
the
contention
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
have
assumed
that
he
did
not
and
we
do
that
because
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
he
in
fact
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
that
he
has
in
fact
collected
it
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
from
the
customers.
we
assume
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
assume
that
because
this
is
a
matter
for
the
plaintiff
to
allege
in
support
of
his
refund
suit.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
has
never
done
that.
he
has
barred
on
to
all
the
rules
with
respect
to
tax
refund
suits
for
making
that
claim
at
any
time
now.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
we
are
not
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that
is
--
it
does
not
require
him.
in
fact,
it
is
passed
on
to
the
vendee.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
that
is
why
the
statute
requires
as
a
condition
to
bringing
a
suit
for
refund
that
you
either
assert
that
you
did
not
collect
it
from
the
vendee
or
procure
the
vendees'
consent
to
bringing
the
action.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
that
in
fact
were
sold,
and
we
don't
believe
it's
sold,
if
it
were
so,
he
could
have
asserted
under
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
he
cannot
do
it
now.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
cannot
do
it
on
any.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
because
this
would
be
--
this
is
a
ground
for
the
taxpayer
to
have
urged
in
support
of
his
refund
suit.
this
would
have
been
the
way
he
could
have
had
this
case
decided
without
embarking
upon
a
controversy
over
rulings
or
administrative
practice.
he
simply
had
to
make
this
factual
assertion,
which
is
within
his
knowledge,
“we
did
not
collect
the
tax
from
our
vendees.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
this
would
be
a
ground
which
the
--
under
our
view,
the
plaintiff
must
assert
in
his
claim
for
refund.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
had
all
the
opportunity
to
raise
it
in
the
claim
for
refund.
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
basic
document
which
a
taxpayer
files
in
--
in
stating
to
the
commissioner
why
he
is
entitled
to
his
money
back,
why
the
tax
was
illegally
imposed.
he
can
state
10
reasons.he
can
state
one
reason.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
suggest
that
simply
to
indicate
that
there
is
no
question
of
retroactivity
in
this
case
because
the
taxpayer
has
not
lay
the
essential
factual
foundations
upon
which
he
could
base
it,
but
this
is
not.
this
is
a
matter
which
would
be
set
forth
in
the
claim
for
a
refund.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
is
entitled
to
a
refund.
he
could
have
two
grounds.
one
ground
is,
as
we
construe
the
ruling,
we
are
exempt
from
the
tax
and
that
ruling,
as
so
construed,
is
valid.
now
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
it
does
not
and
i
don't
--
we
haven't
asserted
that
it
does.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
say
there
is
no
question
of
whether
he
collected
the
tax
in
this
case.
it
is
not
in
the
case
because
it
is
not
part
of
his
cause
of
action.
he
hasn't
relied
upon
any
such
contention.
this
would
be
a
reason
why
the
exaction
of
the
tax
is
unlawful.
he
is
bound
by
the
allegations
in
his
claim
for
refund
and
in
the
complaint.
he
has
never
made
the
smallest
suggestion
of
such
a
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
repudiated
it
at
the
trial.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
said,
"whether
we
collected
the
tax
is
not
in
this
case
at
all."
the
only
question
we
raised
is
the
ruling.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
only
issue
properly
before
this
court
is
to
and
only
that
because
if
the
court
will
examine
the
claim
for
refund,
the
complaint,
the
pleadings,
the
way
this
case
was
tried,
there
was
only
one
issue
ever
asserted
by
the
taxpayer
as
a
reason
why
he
ought
to
recover
and
that
is
the
ruling
exempts
my
units.
he
never
said,
"and
alternatively.
if
you
find
it,
it
does
not
exempt
my
units.
i
urge
because
of
my
reliance
that
i'd
be
granted
the
refund."
he
never
made
that
alternative
assumption
that
he
is
barred
by
--
by
all
the
rules
relating
the
tax
refund
suits
for
making
it.
it
is
not
in
the
claim
for
refund.
now,
he
--
he
drafted
his
claim
for
refund.
it
was
open
to
him
to
assert
any
number
of
grounds
why
he
should
recover.
he
has
never
made
that
assertion.
he
has
not
even
making
it
in
this
court.
he
is
not
asserting
now
that
he
in
fact
collected
the
tax
in
--
under
the
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
estoppel
section
in
the
revenue
act
of
1926.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
i
--
i
didn't
understand
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
first
part.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
we
--
we
would
say
no
because
i
can't
conceive
of
the
finding
that
the
ruling
is
proper
without
also
determining
whether
or
not
the
horsepower
is
determined
in
terms
of
actual
horsepower
or
nominal
horsepower
if
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
are
here
to
sustain
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
mean
that
is
an
alternative
position
here.
one
position
is
that
the
ruling,
if
construed
in
terms
of
nominal
horsepower,
imposes
the
tax
and
even
though
that
test
may
too
narrowly
restrict
the
statute,
that
--
that
would
not
be
an
issue
here
because
it
does
apply
to
these
units.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
is
an
actual
horsepower
test,
it
is
clearly
invalid
because
these
units
which
are
taxable
by
every
conceivable
criterion
would
be
exempt
from
the
tax.
so
we
say
there
is
no
basis
upon
which
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
here.
these
units
are
taxable
under
the
statute
by
any
test
that
can
be
conceived
of.
the
horsepower
test
is
not
rationally
consistent
with
the
statute.
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
reversing
the
district
court
in
holding
that
the
units
were
taxable.
that's
our
basic
position.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
precisely
the
same
issues
would
be
involved.
the
taxpayer
would
still
be
contending
that
under
the
ruling,
however
--
whatever
the
statute
says,
under
the
ruling,
and
this
is
his
sole
contention,
"your
ruling
exempts
my
units
from
tax."
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
ruling
which
refers
in
terms
to
household
type.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute.
it
has
always
been
open
for
--
to
the
taxpayer
to
say,
"my
unit
is
not
self-contained
for
reasons
a,
b
and
c.
all
of
my
unit
is
not
household
type
for
reasons
d,
e
and
f."
he
has
never
said
that.
he
has
said
only
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
at
every
stage
and
that
is
“because
of
the
horsepower
test
in
your
rulings,
my
units
are
exempted."
now,
if
this
--
if
this
court
should
hold
the
statute,
it
only
applies
to
self-contained
units,
there
would
be
no
further
issues
to
litigate
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
well,
the
taxpayer
can
no
longer
file
a
claim
--
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
going
to
say,
if
the
stipulation
means
anything
here,
the
only
reason
the
commissioner
refrained
from
collecting
the
tax
on
these
units
was
because
of
a
stipulation
that
this
was
a
test
case
and
the
disposition
of
the
tax
with
respect
to
these
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
two
units
would
control
the
others.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
said
with
regard
to
the
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
to
obtain
a
refund
here
and
they
would
be
limited
again
by
the
pleading
--
by
the
claim
for
refund
which
is
the
basic
document
which
they
drafted
to
shape
the
issues
in
this
litigation.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
we
say
they
would.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
don't
conceive
that
under
the
--
under
any
view
of
the
law,
they
have
a
right
to
refund
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
say
--
we
--
we
say
he
had
a
right
to
show
that
and
did
not
avail
himself
of
that
opportunity.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
suppose
this
court
could
direct
me.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
but
we
do
say
that
as
this
litigation
was
tried,
the
taxpayer
never
raised
that
claim.
he
never
raised
it.
that
would
be
tantamount
to
a
taxpayer
suing
and
saying,
"the
reason
why
i'm
entitled
to
refund
is
because
the
transaction
is
not
taxable
for
x.”
having
gone
up
to
this
court
and
losing,
he
is
given
an
opportunity
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
say,
"well,
i
have
another
reason
which
i
never
mentioned
before
as
to
why
these
units
are
not
taxable."
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
say
that
it
is
so
clear
that
these
units
are
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
because
that
--
that
issue
came
into
this
case
simply
by
way
of
the
government's
attempting
to
show
this
court
that
there
was
no
collection
of
the
tax
on
the
theory
that
if
there
was
such
--
that
if
the
taxpayer
has
failed
to
collect
it,
they
would
have
asserted
it
and
won
their
case
based
on
this
estoppel
ground.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
but
they
never
asked
for
the
benefit
of
this
statute.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
--
the
right
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
--
we
say
that
it
--
that
it
was.
but
in
any
event,
we
say
that
a
position
which
would
grant
him
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
this
was
raised
below.
in
the
district
court,
he
had
an
opportunity.
the
government
counsel,
in
his
closing
remarks
to
the
district
judge,
said,
"why
hasn't
he
alleged
that
he
failed
to
collect
the
tax?
we've
conceded
that
this
ruling
is
ambiguous.
why
hasn't
he
alleged
it
to
you,
district
judge?
why
doesn't
he
make
that
claim
now?"
and
the
response
was,
and
this
is
in
the
record
and
the
court
can
read
it
there,
the
response
was,
"there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
what
we
did
about
this
tax
and
that's
not
in
the
case."
and
that
is
why
the
taxpayer
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
because
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
will
see
from
the
record
that
this
taxpayer
stated
below,
"there
is
no
issue
of
the
estoppel.
we
will
not
prevent
you
from
arguing
that
your
ruling
--
that
the
ruling,
if
