mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
that
can
be
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
rate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
nema
rating
the
normal
or
the
--
the
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
that's
the
actual?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this,
why
--
why
the
difference?
why
do
you
use
two
in
your
business?
why
do
you
use
two
standards?
one
an
industry
standard
and
one
--
one
an
actual
standard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
normally
for
tax
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
actual
horsepower?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
not
--
not
substantially.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
stipulation
that
you
speak
of
a
stipulation
of
fact
or
of
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
about
the
household?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
it's
your
position
that
they
stipulated
themselves
out
of
court
by
their
legal
concessions,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
this
is
a
test
case,
should
we
abide
by
that
if
they're
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
correct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
mr.
--
mr.
rothschild.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heffron.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heffron,
let
me
ask
you
once
more.
i
said,
i
am
--
to
straighten
my
mind.
has
this
manufacturer
collected
from
the
people
he
sold
these
50,000
machines
to
the
tax
that
we're
discussing
here
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
care
whether
he
has
raised
a
contention
or
not,
but
are
we
not
entitled
to
know
when
we're
dealing
with
this
case
whether
he
has
actually
passed
that
on
to
--
to
the
people
who
bought
those
things
and
whether
he
would
get
a
windfall
if
he
won
in
this
case
or
--
or
whether
he
would
suffer
the
loss
of
a
million
dollars
by
having
to
pay
the
--
the
government
a
million
dollars
that
--
that
he
didn't
think
he
had
to
pay
relying
on
the
government's
regulation.
now,
there's
a
great
difference
between
the
two
and
can't
--
can't
we
find
out,
can't
we
know
whether
he
--
he
did
pass
it
on
to
those
--
those
purchasers
in
the
50,000?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
assume
that
he
has.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
his
refund
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
require.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heffron,
in
the
trial
court,
you
stipulated
that
the
--
or
the
government
stipulated
that
these
units
were
of
the
household
type.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
stipulation,
would
there
been
--
have
been
any
issues
open
to
counsel
or
to
the
taxpayer
that
are
not
open
to
him
in
the
case
with
the
stipulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
--
go
finish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
rothschild,
i'm
--
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question.
i
don't
want
you
to
reargue
your
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
took
your
time,
but
i
want
to
ask
you
the
case
because
i
want
to
know
before
we
adjourn.
and
i'm
speaking
now
to
these
50,000
units.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
pass
a
tax
on
to
your
--
to
your
purchasers
and
collected
on
the
theory
that
you
are
going
to
pay
it
to
the
government
and
now
seek
to
--
to
deprive
the
government
of
the
right
to
collect
that
tax
and
to
keep
that
money
or
did
you,
relying
upon
the
regulations
and
rulings
of
the
department,
failed
to
pass
that
on
to
your
--
to
your
purchasers
in
which
event
you
would
now
owe
the
government
a
million
dollars
or
so
out
of
your
own
pocket?
which
of
the
two
is
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
latter
is
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
you
may
answer
that
question
rather
boldly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that
is
your
answer
that
you
would
now
be
stuck
for
a
million
or
so
dollars
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you
have
not
passed
on
to
your
customers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
rothschild,
may
i
ask
you
one
--
just
one
more
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
more
question?
you
complained
of
the
shift
in
the
government's
position
on
the
stipulation
that
they
made
concerning
the
household
type
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
these
units.
will
you
answer
me
this
question
if
you
can,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
that
--
if
that
stipulation
had
been
--
not
been
made
by
the
government
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
there
have
been
any
issues
available
to
you
in
this
lawsuit
that
were
--
that
were
actually
foreclosed
by
reason
of
this
stipulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
rothschild.[laughter]
