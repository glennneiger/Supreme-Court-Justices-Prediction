by
that,
do
you
mean
a
label
or
some
kind
on
the
motor?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
sir?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
course
you
don't
contend,
i
assume,
that
if,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
--
the
treasury
decisions
were
void
that
we
should
not
pronounce
the
meaning
and
the
fact
of
the
statute
ourselves,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right,
now,
then,
if
the
statute
is
plain
and
leaves
no
room
for
any
conditioning
by
the
commissioner,
then
we
should
pronounce
it
effect
--
its
effect,
should
we?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right,
now
then,
let
me
ask
you
next.
had
you
passed
along
to
your
customers
on
these
sales
an
added
tax
of
10%?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
were
passed
it
on?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then,
did
you
rely
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
did
you
rely
on
section
1108
(b)
of
the
1926
act
in
your
conduct
and
on
these
treasury
decisions?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
cases
have
to
go
back
or
at
least
had
purpose,
would
it?
is
that
what
you
--
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
not
in
the
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
another
thing
--
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand.
are
you
saying
that
whether
it's
a
half
horsepower
or
three-quarter
horsepower,
a
one
and
a
half
horsepower
has
no
relevancy
whether
or
not
it's
self-contained?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
where
has
he
had
an
opportunity
to
put
that
in
issue
up
to
now,
mr.
heffron?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
if
you
tried
the
case
on
agreed
issues
below
how
on
the
world
that
he
have
an
opportunity
to
raise
any
such
thing?
