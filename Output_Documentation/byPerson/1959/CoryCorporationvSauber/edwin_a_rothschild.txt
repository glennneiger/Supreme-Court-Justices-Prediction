mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
excise
tax
case
which
involves
more
than
a
question
of
revenue.
it
involves
questions,
which,
i
think,
touch
on
the
integrity
of
the
process
of
judicial
review.in
fact,
one
of
the
principal
questions
raised
is
what
questions
are
before
this
court.
the
taxpayers,
whom
i
represent,
recovered
a
refund
judgment
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
on
excise
tax
assessed
and
paid
on
to
our
conditioning
units.
this
was
a
test
case.
the
government
appealed
and
obtained
the
reversal
of
the
district
court
on
issues
of
law
and
fact
which
were
not
presented
to
the
trial
court.
and
we
applied
for
certiorari
and
raised
the
questions
that
appear
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
there
were
five
of
them.
and
the
government
responded
to
that
petition
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right.
between
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
government's
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari
and
the
filing
of
its
brief
on
the
merits,
12
days
ago,
the
government
changed
its
position
again
and
admitted
error
in
the
basic
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
but,
nevertheless,
seeks
to
salvage
the
reversal
of
the
district
court.
on
no
grounds,
they
were
not
presented
either
to
the
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
think
that
the
record
shows
an
--
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
attempt
to
obtain
a
new
trial
de
novo
in
this
court
after
the
certiorari
papers
were
filed.
the
facts
are
simple.
taxpayers
file
suit
in
the
district
court,
as
i
stated,
for
the
refund
of
excise
tax
paid
on
the
sales
of
two
air
conditioners
sold
in
1954
and
1955.
and
by
stipulation
with
the
government,
these
refund
suits
were
test
suits
to
determine
the
applicability
of
the
excise
tax
to
more
than
50,000
similar
units
on
which
excise
taxes
had
been
assessed
but
not
paid.
the
statutes
section
3405
(c)
of
the
1939
code
and
section
4111
of
the
1954
code
impose
a
--
this
impose
excise
taxes
on
various
types
of
household
type
equipment
impose
a
10%
tax
on
the
sale
of
self-contained
air
conditioning
units.
and
until
12
days
ago,
when
the
government's
brief
on
the
merits
was
filed,
both
parties
agreed
that
this
tax
applied
only
to
units
of
a
household
type.
now,
since
1948
and
until
really,
until
a
few
months
ago
and
a
new
regulation
was
issued
in
response
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
consistently
administered
the
tax
under
published
revenue
rulings
which
provide
that
the
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
ruling
now,
"type
of
self-contained
air
conditioning
units
subject
to
tax"
is
the
unit
of
certain
specified
physical
characteristics,
window
type
and
such,
that
has
a
total
motor
horsepower
of
less
than
1
horsepower,
and
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
consistently
since
1948,
this
tax
has
had
been
administered
so
that
the
commissioner
has
not
know
--
as
it
consistently
exempted
air
conditioners
with
a
motor
horsepower
of
1
horsepower
or
more.
now,
at
the
trial
and
incidentally,
the
only
issue
raised
by
the
pleadings
was
the
question
of
horsepower,
that
is
whether
the
units
of
the
taxpayer
were
1
horsepower
or
less
than
1
horsepower.
and
there
are
only
two
standards
for
determining
what
horsepower
is.
one
is
the
actual
horsepower
that
you
can
measure
under
standard
operating
conditions
when
the
machine
is
in
operation,
and
the
other
is
the
rated
horsepower
of
the
electric
motor
which
drives
the
compressor
which
runs
the
air
conditioning
unit.
the
rated
horsepower
means
the
rating
standards
published
by
the
national
electrical
manufacturers
association
have
published
standards
for
the
guidance
of
their
members
in
rating
and
putting
horsepower
ratings
on
the
electric
motors
which
drive
the
compressors
and
the
air
conditioners.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
the
--
the
label
is
what
i
would
call
nominal
horsepower
reading.
in
other
words,
each
motor
manufacturer
who
makes
an
electric
motor
assigns
to
it
a
nominal
horsepower
rating.
now,
he
can,
if
he
--
and
he
is
more
or
less
expected
to
follow
the
industrial
standards,
the
nema
rating
standards
but
he
doesn't
have
to.
and
in
this
case,
he
didn't.
in
other
words,
perhaps,
i
can
explain
it
just
by
referring
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
issue
at
the
trial
of
this
case
was
whether,
under
the
rating
standards,
the
nema
standards
of
the
national
electrical
manufacturers
association,
the
air
conditioners
in
question
should
have
had
a
1
horsepower
rating.
the
district
court,
and
this
was
the
only,
incidentally,
the
only
contested
issue
of
fact
in
the
case,
the
district
court
held
against
the
government,
held
that
they
did
have
a
1
horsepower
rating
under
the
nema
standards.
nevertheless,
the
motor
manufacturers
who
made
the
motors
signed
them
a
nominal
rating
of
three
quarter
horsepower
and
the
issue
at
the
trial
was
that
the
--
had
these
motor
manufacturers
mislabeled
their
motors
or
had
they
done
so
correctly?
the
government's
trial
counsel,
and
i'd
like
to
quote
his
own
words
because
i
think
the
issue
at
the
trial
is
rather
crucial
in
this
case,
had
framed
the
evidence.
it
said
as
follows,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
105
of
the
record,
"we
say
that
a
1
horsepower
motor
is
used
in
the
ruling
means
the
motor
that
can
be
rated
as
a
1
horsepower
motor.”
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
rated,
r-a
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
rated,
yes.
we
have
tried
to
prove
today
that
these
motors,
under
the
nema
standards,
cannot
be
rated
as
1
horsepower
motors.
and
on
the
next
page
of
the
record,
we
were
talking
about
this
nominal
three
quarter
horsepower
rating,
government
counsel
again
said,
“that
is
the
rating
that
was
put
on
them
by
the
manufacturers
of
the
electric
motors
in
conformance
with
the
nema
standards.”
you
can
find
that's
on
page
106
of
the
same
record.
now,
the
issues
that
were
raised
on
appeal
were
simply
eliminated
from
the
trial
by
another
stipulation
that
was
made
between
trial
counsel
and
myself,
while
i
was
trial
counsel
below,
as
i
am
here.
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
case
which
followed
a
pretrial
conference
when
we
did
narrow
the
issues.
government
trial
counsels
stipulated
that
the
revenue
rulings
were
entirely
valid
as
the
government
construed
them.
and
as
i've
already
shown
from
quotations
from
the
government's
counsel
statements,
the
government
construed
them
as
applying
these
nema
ratings.
and
this
completely
removed
from
the
trial
of
the
case
a
vast
number
of
miscellaneous
issues
of
evidence
which,
of
course,
were
not
needed
to
be
tried.
the
district
court,
the
only
issue
of
fact
left
that
was
tried
in
the
district
court
was
one
and
that
was
whether
our
air
conditioners
had
a
nema
rating
of
1
horsepower.
the
trial
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
the
standard,
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
--
the
industrial
standard
rating.
actual
horsepower
is
something
that
you
determine
by
measurement,
and
we
contented
incidentally
for
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
and
we
still
think
that's
proper.
but
--
and
it
was
stipulated
that
--
that
our
motors
have
an
actual
horsepower
of
1
horsepower.
but
the
issue
was
--
at
the
trial
was
whether
if
--
if
the
industry
standards,
the
nema
rating
standards
had
been
applied
where
there
are
units
would
have
had
a
nema
rated
horsepower
of
1
horsepower.
and
the
district
court
held
that
they
have.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
it's
really
a
question
of
interpreting
rather
the
revenue
rulings.
the
industry
by
and
large
follows
the
nema
ratings.
that's
the
--
the
nema
ratings
are
--
are
published
as
a
guide
for
the
guidance
of
motor
manufacturers
in
rating
their
motors.
we
--
we
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
for
--
the
fact
of
the
matter,
your
honor,
is
this
is
a
new
case
as
far
as
tax
purposes
are
concerned
because
i
don't
believe
its
ever
--
there's
ever
been
a
--
a
contest
where
it
appeared
that
the
label,
that
is
the
nominal
horsepower
rating,
was
inconsistent
with
the
nema
standard
rating.
here,
you
see
they
rated
the
units
of
three
quarter
horsepower.
if
they
followed
the
nema
standard,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
question.
they
did
not
follow
the
nema
standard
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
the
actual
horsepower
is
more
than
1
horsepower.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
oh,
a
couple
of
points
more.
it's
in
the
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
no,
not
substantially.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
there's
a
pretty
close
correlation
between
the
rating
standards
they
just
do
it
in
a
different
way,
the
nema
rating
standards
and
the
actual
horsepower.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
and
that's
the
way
the
tax
has
been
administered
from
the
beginning.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
the
--
was
--
simply,
the
--
the
test
case
was
to
determine
whether
there
are
some
50,000
air
conditioners
on
which
the
commissioner
has
levied
assessments.we
haven't
paid
the
tax
on
those
because
we
say
they're
not
taxable
because
they're
1
horsepower
units.
because
of
the
procedural
difficulty
on
an
excise
tax
case
in
getting
an
adjudication,
you
have
to
pay
the
tax
and
sue
for
refund.
we
stipulated
with
the
government
that
the
applicability
of
the
tax,
as
adjudicated
by
the
results
on
the
--
of
the
trial
on
these
two
units,
would
govern
the
applicability
of
the
--
of
the
tax
to
these
additional
50,000
units
on
which
the
assessments
have
been
made.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
the
point
of
law?
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
the
point
of
--
the
principle
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
point
of
law
that
was
passed
on
by
the
district
court
is
one
that
was
agreed
to
by
the
government,
that
is
that
the
nema
standards
applied
that
these
were
--
these
--
these
units
were
exempt
under
the
nema
standards.
and
therefore,
there
really
wasn't
anything
for
the
government
to
appeal
on
because
the
government
does
not
challenge
the
finding
of
fact
of
the
district
court
that
these
are
1
horsepower
units
under
the
nema
standards.
in
order
to
appeal,
the
government
was
required
to
change
its
position
and
repudiate
that
stipulation
that
i
just
called
to
your
honors'
attention.
on
appeal,
the
government
said,
“our
rulings
are
void
even
if
they
--
even
if
you
will
interpret
them
to
include
the
nema
ratings,”
and
they
said,
“these
--
these
air
conditioners
are
taxable
because
they
are
of
a
household
type,
irrespective
of
their
horsepower
rating.”
now,
that
was
an
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
whether
it's
one,
two,
three
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
--
or
--
that's
right.
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
our
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
our
point
of
law
in
our
original
brief,
your
honor,
was
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
its
decision
even
assuming
that
it
--
that
it
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
rulings
were
void.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
rated
or
actual
horsepower
is
immaterial.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
lack
the
power
to
set
up
a
horsepower
test
because
--
principally
because
the
word
“horsepower”
wasn't
mentioned
in
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
self
--
self-contained
air
conditioning
units.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
size.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
horsepower
test
was
simply
invalid
because
it
wasn't
the
--
the
commissioner
didn't
have
that
much
power.
the
court
also
held
the
household
type.
and
at
this
point,
your
honors,
the
government
was
still
contending
for
household
type.
the
household
type
was
a
word
that
everybody
understands
and
you
didn't
need
any
ruling
to
explain
it.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
the
statute
is
self-contained
air
conditioning
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
not
--
not
in
so
many
words.
it's
--
the
statute,
however,
is
the
word
tax
on
self-contained
air
conditioning
units,
was
part
of
a
statute
which
taxed
other
kinds
of
household
type
items
like
household
refrigerators.
and
it
was
reenacted
in
the
1954
code
under
the
heading
“household
type
equipment,
etcetera”
and
that
is
why
and
for
--
there
are
--
also,
there
are
some
administrative
history
too.
this
matter
was
brought
to
the
contention
of
congress
in
1956.
but
that
is
why,
your
honor,
both
the
government
and
ourselves,
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
case
until
12
days
ago,
agreed
that
the
statute
was
limited
to
the
household
type.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
the
statute
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
the
language
of
the
statute
appears
in
--
well,
in
our
--
we
have
in
our
appendix
page
39
of
our
main
brief
both
and
--
that's
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
--
that's
the
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
--
original
of
1939
code.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
you
have
to
go
down
to
c.
household
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
c
on
page
40,
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
all
there
is.
then
on
--
in
1954,
it
was
reenacted
and
that's
on
page
41
of
the
same
appendix,
your
honor,
internal
revenue
code
1954,
household
type
equipment,
etcetera,
and
then
we
have
the
--
virtually
the
same
language.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
except
for
the
subheading,
no.
and
the
--
the
household
type
units
with
which
this
is
associated.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
the
stipulation
of
--
of
the
--
that
the
--
the
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
oh,
that
it
--
it
implied
the
household
types?
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that
was
a
stipulation
of
law.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
i
--
i've
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
the
stipulation
appears
in
the
briefs.
well,
there
are
two
stipulations,
your
honor,
both
of
which
have
been
repudiated.
the
first
stipulation
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
all
right,
the
first
stipulation,
your
honor,
is
the
one
that
was
made
in
the
trial
court.
and
that
does
--
that's
at
page
56
of
the
record.
mr.
stetson
was
the
attorney
for
the
government
and
after
we
had
our
conference,
we
--
he
--
he
made
this
stipulation,
“your
honor,”
and
this
is
to
the
trial
court,
“there
is
one
more
matter
which
i
think
we
agreed
on
as
a
stipulation.i
would
like
to
dictate
a
stipulation
into
the
record,
if
i
may,
which
is
this,
if
the
court
should
determine
that
the
ruling
must
be
interpreted
in
a
manner
as
contended
by
the
plaintiffs,
that's
actual
horsepower,”
as
distinguished
from
nema
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
--
rating,
i'm
interpolating
there.
“the
plaintiffs
will
not
argue
that
the
government
doesn't
stop
to
argue
--
argue
that
the
ruling
is
invalid,”
and
i
said,
“so
construed,”
and
he
said,
“as
so
construed”.
in
other
words,
he
reserved
the
right
to
attack
the
validity
of
the
ruling
only
to
the
extent
that
it
incorporate
actual
horsepower
and
then
i
said,
“i'll
agree
to
that,”
and
we
did
that
in
order
to
shorten
proof
in
issues.
my
understanding
is
that
the
government's
position
is
the
ruling
is
entirely
valid
as
the
government
construes
it
but
not
as
we
construe
it.
“is
that
correct?”
and
he
said
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
oh,
the
government
construed
it
in
the
language
of
the
attorney
that
i
read
before
as
incorporating
the
nema's
rating
standards.
he
said
that
--
we
say
that
this
incorporates
the
nema
standards.
and
that's
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
i'm
sorry,
sir
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
it's
the
stipulation
as
to
what
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
it's
a
stipulation
as
to
both
acts,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
but
it's
more
than
that,
your
honor.
it's
a
waiver
of
defense.
in
other
words,
he
agreed
that
the
government
would
not
assert
as
a
defense
to
this
law
suit
either
that
our
units
were
taxable
if
they
had
a
nema
rating
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
there
--
there's
also
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
there's
also
a
question
of
fact,
your
honor,
which
is
this.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
of
course.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
of
course
that
--
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
that
we
didn't
put
in
any
evidence
to
show
that
there
are
units
where
--
of
a
household
type
independently
of
the
revenue
ruling
that
was
involved.
we
didn't
put
in
any
--
any
witnesses
to
show
that
our
units
were
not
self-contained
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
if
the
--
if
it
has
that
more
limited
meaning.
these
issues
were
never
tried
because
the
government
stipulated
that
their
rulings
were
valid
and
we've
narrowed
the
issue
down
to
this
one
point,
the
horsepower
point.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
i'm
asking
you
to
do
more
of
the
latter
than
the
former
because
i
--
i
admit
that
this
court
is
not
bound
by
a
stipulation
of
law.
of
course,
that's
well
settled.
but
i
am
saying
that
--
that
when
the
case
is
tried
on
issues
and
those
--
and
specific
defenses
which
could've
been
raised
are
waived
and
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
which
might
be,
except
that
the
government
was
perfectly
cognizant
of
everything
they've
raised
right
now.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
if
--
if
this
court
holds
that
--
well,
first
of
all,
if
this
court
holds
that
the
government's
new
contentions
should
be
considered,
which
i
--
i
think
under
your
past
practice,
you
--
you
would
not
normally
do
so
and
--
but
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
because
they
tried
the
case
on
different
issues
and
the
trial
court
and
they're
trying
it
on
this
court,
your
honor,
and
therefore
it's
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
i
don't
think
your
honors
have
to
do
that.
i
think
your
honors
can
--
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
it's
a
wrong
construction
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
--
but
--
but
i'm
assuming
that
it
is,
yes.
assuming
that
it
is
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
no,
i
am
suggesting
that
--
to
the
court
that
the
government
be
tried
--
that
the
government
try
the
cases
and
have
this
--
this
court
review
the
issues
that
were
presented
to
the
trial
court
and
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
trial
court
was
not
the
issue
that
was
presented
either
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
to
this
court,
and
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
this
court
will
not
consider,
regardless
of
the
merits
of
an
issue,
will
not
consider
issues
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
and
certainly
issues
raised
for
the
first
time
after
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes,
i'm
aware.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
i'm
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
no,
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.and
that
--
that's
the
--
i
--
and
that's
--
that
of
course
is
the
first
point
in
our
main
brief,
but
i
was
assuming
you
were
assuming
that
--
that
i
was
to
hold
that
that
--
that
i
was
to
assume
that
that
was
wrong.
now,
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
certainly,
that's
--
that's
right.
that's
one
--
one
way
of
treat
the
court
of
--
let
me
start
over.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
i
think
it
is.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
but
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
i
think
that
we
have
a
--
we
have
a
number
of
reasons,
your
honor,
why
the
--
why
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
first
one,
irrespective
of
--
of
the
fact
that
there
--
there
was
a
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
never
tried
in
the
district
court,
the
fact
is
that
the
reason
given
for
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
as
justice
harlan
points
out,
not
only
was
this
statute
administered
and
interpreted
by
the
department
of
internal
revenue
for
10
years
to
mean
horsepower
but
this
matter
was
expressly
called
to
the
attention
of
congress
to
a
congressional
committee
in
1956,
and
the
spokesman
for
the
industry
pointed
out
to
congress,
so
there
can't
be
any
question
about
that,
expressly
pointed
out
to
congress
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
this
--
this
was
the
way
the
statute
was
being
administered.
he
says
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
those
are
alternative
grounds,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
if
i
wasn't
clear.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
no.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
on
the
two
air
conditioners
involved,
your
honor,
we
have
because
we're
not
claiming
that.
there
--
there
we
are
--
we
are
bringing
our
action
under
a
section
which
the
only
section
which
permits
the
refund
suit
on
excise
taxes
must
be
brought
with
the
consent
of
the
ultimate
consumer.
and
there,
we
are
entitled
to
bring
a
refund
suit
with
the
consent
of
the
ultimate
consumer.
that's
on
the
two
taxes
we
paid.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
see,
we
paid
those
before
we
knew
that
they'd
been
mislabeled.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
and
then
we
pick
them
for
--
for
test
suits.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
on
the
other
suits
–
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
--
on
the
other
50,000
air
conditioner
units,
we
have
not
paid
the
taxes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
now,
let
me
say
that
i'm
talking
outside
of
the
record
because
that
can't
be
an
issue
yet.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
we
relied
on
the
revenue
ruling,
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
think
we
could
invoke
1108
(b)
if,
in
a
proper
case,
if
and
when
suits
for
refunds
are
bought,
and
if
and
when
we
have
to
pay
taxes
on
these
50,000
units
and
then
bring
a
suit
for
refund,
then
--
then
that's
the
first
time
we
can
invoke
1108
(b)
and
in
that
case,
we
would
of
course.
but
at
this
point,
that
can't
be
an
issue
because
there
is
no
machinery
protesting
the
applicability
of
the
tax.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
now,
actually,
we
would
have
start
new
suits.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
because
we'd
have
to
--
in
other
words,
we'd
have
to
pay
the
tax,
we'd
have
to
pay
over
a
million
dollars
of
tax
to
the
united
states
on
a
tax
that
we
claim
as
wholly
inapplicable.
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
and
then
file
--
claim
for
refund
and
at
the
end
of
six
months,
if
that
claim
hasn't
allowed,
then,
for
the
first
time,
we
can
bring
the
same
kind
of
suits
we
brought
here
on
50,000
or
more
air
conditioning
units.
and
that's
the
first
time
that
we
can
raise
the
issue
of
1108
(b).
we
just
can't
do
it
any
other
way.
the
whole
purpose
of
making
this
a
test
case
was
to
determine
the
tax
--
the
applicability
of
the
tax
to
these
units
and
thereby
avoid
the
necessity
of
going
through
thousands
of
separate
proceedings
in
order
to
obtain
refund
suits
on
similar
units.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
my
time
is
up.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
i
won't,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
the
latter,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
now,
i
know
--
i
know
you
don't
want
to
reargue.
may
i
ask
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
--
may
i
state
just
one
thing?
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
in
connection
with
that
question
on
why
it
is
not
in
the
record,
is
that
proper?
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
and
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
point.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
on
these
two
units?
we
certainly
did
as
i
explained
to,
i
think
was
justice
whittaker.
these
were
units
that
happened
to
have
been
sold
to
--
directly
to
a
lawyer
and
to
an
accountant
of
the
taxpayer
before
it
came
to
our
attention
that
--
that
these
units
were
exempt
under
the
rulings
because
they
had
been
mislabeled.
we
simply
selected
these
two
units
which
had
a
$29.93
was
paid
to
the
government
without
a
protest
passed
on
to
the
consumer
and
collected
from
him
on
these
units.
and
it
was
after
we
decided
to
bring
a
test
suit
that
we
happened
to
pick
these
two
units,
and
it
was
after
that
point
that
we
sold
the
$50,000
units,
and
we
brought
these
suits
on
these
two
test
units
simply
to
test
the
taxability
of
the
50,000.
and
there
is
no
conceivable
procedural
way
in
which
we
could've
put
on
any
evidence
such
as
mr.
heffron
says,
"we
should
have
put
on
to
prove
that
we
had
suffered
a
loss
in
the
50,000
without
going
through
50,000
claims
for
refund
in
--
in
the
same
manner."
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
no,
because
the
only
--
the
only
similarity,
your
honor,
and
the
only
reason
that
--
that
we
stipulate
it
was
because
these
suits
in
these
air
conditioners,
the
50,000
in
physical
content,
in
size,
in
horsepower
were
the
same
as
the
two
and
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
we'd
be
out
of
pocket.
in
a
sense,
we
pay
back
$29.93
but
that
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
but
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
it's
a
test
case
for
one
purpose,
your
honor.
it
was
a
test
case
to
determine
the
applicability
of
the
excise
tax
to
units
of
the
size
described
in
the
stipulation
of
facts.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
if
we're
wrong
in
our
law,
your
honor,
and
we
are
--
and
here's
--
here's
what
will
happen.
if
we're
wrong
and
the
government
wins
this
case,
then
we
will
have
to
pay
by
over
a
million
dollars
of
taxes,
file
claims
for
refund,
hope
that
we
can
persuade
the
treasury,
which
i
don't
think
we
will,
that
we
should
--
that
they
shouldn't
charge
us
this
tax,
then
we
would
have
to
file
tests
--
additional
suits
and
make
affirmative
proof
that
we
--
that
we
absorbed
the
tax
on
all
of
these
50,000
units.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
i've
got
to
prove
that
in
50,000
cases.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
i
mean
it's
not
in
the
record.
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
that's
the
only
act
that
we
have,
your
honor.
we
--
we
made
a
test
suit
to
determine
the
applicability
of
the
tax.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
no,
we
couldn't
possible
recover
it
on
that
basis
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
--
on
this
procedure.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
certainly,
your
honor.
household
type,
whether
or
not
these
air
conditioners
were
primarily
designed
for
--
to
meet
the
needs
of
a
household
was
a
question
of
fact
which
was
not
tried
because
of
the
government's
stipulation.
the
other
question
is
whether
they
are
self-contained
which
is
the
new
issue
raised
by
the
government
on
its
brief
on
the
merits.
self-contained
is
now
a
word
of
art
because
the
government
has
actually
an
exhibit
saying
that
it
covers
anything
from
a
small
portable
to
1000
horsepower
plant.
and
the
only
expression
of
the
industry
as
to
the
meaning
of
self-contained,
and
that's
urged
by
the
government's
issues
of
fact,
the
only
expression
of
the
industry
takes
in
horsepower
and
the
government
itself
says
horsepower
applies
so
that
if
self-contained
--
so
that
if
these
units
are
just
self-contained
as
a
matter
of
law
as
the
government
contains
now,
why
would
they
be
relying
as
they
do
in
their
brief,
your
honor,
on
the
horsepower
test
on
the
understanding
of
the
industry
and
on
the
intention
of
the
commissioner?
those
are
issues
of
fact
which
were
not
raised
in
the
trial
court
which
are
raised
in
this
court
and
which
we
have
had
no
opportunity
to
meet.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
that's
true
on
both.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
they
are
room
units.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
because
the
larger
--
and
this
--
the
evidence
shows
this,
your
honor,
in
the
record.
the
larger
units
are
considered
commercial
units.
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
well,
that's
--
that's
the
principal
distinction
between
household
and
commercial
is
size.
that's
been
carried
--
mr.
edwin
a.
rothschild
when
you
get
up
to
one
or
one
and
a
half,
you
will
find
their
primary
use
is
--
is
not
in
house
--
and
that
was
certainly
true
when
the
regulation
was
passed
in
1948,
