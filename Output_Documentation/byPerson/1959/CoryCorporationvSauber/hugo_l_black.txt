justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
your
test
case
is
about?you
talked
a
lot
about
what
this
record
shows,
but
i
understood
you
to
say
at
the
beginning,
this
was
a
test
case
to
determine
some
point
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
point
of
law
you
are
trying
to
get
determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it's
--
whether
it's
one
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
two
or
three.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
--
that
is
your
main
point
of
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
now
about
what
would
decide
this
particular
case
on
the
basis
that
the
government
started
off
one
way
and
then
stepped
over
and
took
another
and
then
took
a
third.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
hold
with
reference
to
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute
simply
provides
for
tax
on
household
appliances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
now
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
self-contained
air-con
and
didn't
--
doesn't
say
anything
at
all
about
what
size?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
where
is
the
statute
if
you
don't
find
it
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
pointing
out
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
part
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part
of
that
on
page
39?
justice
hugo
l.
black
c
on
page
40?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
whole
definition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any
difference
in
the
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
did
the
government
construed
it?
you
say
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
ruling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
a
--
a
unit.i
have
a
number
of
them,
and
some
of
them
are
one
side
and
some
are
another.
i
can't
see
what's
difference
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
--
what
does
the
horsepower
have
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it's
self-contained?
justice
hugo
l.
black
couldn't
in
a
house
unit
like
you
put
in
your
window?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
kind
you're
imposing
it
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
of
them
(voice
overlap)
they
even
advertised
them
too
now,
aren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
affect?
are
--
are
you
--
are
you
proposing
to
impose
a
tax
which
is
retroactive?
i
do
not
understand
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
your
abandonment
of
the
regulation.
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
conceive
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
have
sold
it
and
relied
on
this
and
not
collected
the
tax
that
they're
not
liable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
only
affects
them
in
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
the
tax
has
been
included
in
these
two
machines?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
--
what
are
those
50,000
units
he's
talking
about?
who
has
them
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
been
sold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
he's
talking
about
that
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
been
told
and
if
he
has
paid
out
the
tax
and
passed
it
on,
you
say
that
he
couldn't
get
it
back.
he's
paid
out
that
tax
and
not
passed
it
on,
what
do
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
sold
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
sold
50,000
and
has
collected
the
tax
from
the
customer
on
all
of
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
your
contention
he'd
owe
that
to
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
has
sold
the
50,000
units
and
not
paid
any
tax
on
any
of
them,
you
say
then
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong?
so
help
me.
i
thought
the
law
required
that
he
collected
that
excise
tax
to
collect
it
from
the
customer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
position
or
is
the
government
to
take
this
position,
it
is
for
making
the
people
pay
back
money
to
the
government,
pay
money
to
the
government
where
under
the
circumstances
which
he's
indicated
here?
suppose
--
suppose
he
has
collected
--
suppose
he
sold
this
and
collected
the
tax
from
the
consumer,
you
say
then
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
get
it
back,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
oppose
he
has
sold
them
without
collecting
it
from
the
consumer
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
didn't
require
him
to
collect,
what's
the
government's
position
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
not
talking
about
what
he
could've
done
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
can
he
do
it
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
on
these
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
test
case.
it
governs
all
these
units.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
raise
this
in
the
--
below
or
in
the
district
court
as
near
as
i
can
with
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
now.
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
his
contention
that
you
are
estop
and
i
understand
your
contention
that
in
someway
we
are
estop
by
you
having
agreed
that
this
50,000
would
be
the
same
as
the
two.
now
--
however,
there's
a
provision
with
reference
to
appeal
that
we
construed
in
(inaudible)
which
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
that
we
dispose
of
the
case
as
justice
requires.
now,
let
us
assume
that
we
hold
the
statute
is
--
is
valid
under
your
claim,
not
under
his,
that
would
mean,
of
course,
that
he
did
pass
on
the
tax
in
the
two
and
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
have
that
retried
anymore
to
but
why
do
we
have
to
say
that
with
the
situation
changing
as
it
has,
they
shouldn't
have
a
chance
to
have
the
case
reopened
for
that
to
be
tried
out
in
the
court
below
if
--
whether
he
passed
it
on
or
not,
except
by
--
should
you
stipulate
it
so
that
if
justice
required
it,
we
shouldn't
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
the
government
want
a
holding
for
these
50,000
units
on
this
so-called
ambiguous
stipulation?
if
you
conceive
that
under
the
law,
he
may
have
a
right
to
get
refund
because
he
has
not
passed
them
on,
why
should
the
government
take
that
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand
that.
well,
i
understand
you
do
conceive
that
in
a
test
over
this
that
if
he
has
not
passed
this
tax
on,
he
would
have
a
right
to
show
that
under
the
section
to
which
you
referred
in
order
to
get
a
refund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
had
a
right
--
had
a
right
below
but
you
want
to
hold
him
on
the
50,000
on
the
basis
of
the
two.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
problem
is
that
if
that's
--
if
he's
entitled
to
something
under
the
law
that
congress
has
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
doubt
this
test,
[laughs]
you
would
take
it
the
law
is
clear
and
so
forth.[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
--
also,
the
law
is
clear,
isn't
it,
i
understood
you
from
that
statute
as
a
man
who
pays
the
tax,
an
excise
tax
and
he's
relied
on
a
ruling
of
the
remedy
which
turns
out
to
be
bad,
the
congress
is
seen
fit
to
give
him
a
special
relief
under
the
section
to
which
you
refer
us.
now,
if
that's
true
in
this
case,
why
should
the
government
insist
that
he'd
be
cutoff
from
that
because
of
that
test?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
about
that
issue
of
fact.
i
thought
it
was
conceded
that
these
whole
household
room
units.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
--
why
do
you
say
there'd
be
a
question
as
whether
or
not
they
were
household
appliance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
an
arbitrary
line
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
horsepower
question.
i'm
just
talking
about
whether
they
were
households.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
when
it
get
above
--
you
--
when
it
get
above
one
ton,
they
are
not
household?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
want
to
ask
you
one
other
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
curiosity
maybe.
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
that
tax
go
up
on
june
the
1st?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
household
units?
it's
been
advertised
that
it's
going
up
on
june
the1st
in
all
the
places.
and
they
told
me
it
was
going
up
june
the
1st,
it'd
be
by
now.[laughter]
do
you
say
it's
not
going
up?
did
--
did
congress
not
increase
it
right
--
recently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
the
new
regulations.
that's
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
being
talked
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
june
the
1st.
justice
hugo
l.
black
subsequent
to
the
time
this

ruling
