that
--
what
is
the
meaning
of
one
--
one
or
more
horsepower?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
in
the
regulation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
does
the
regulation,
at
the
bottom
of
page
55
of
the
brief's
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
(inaudible)
would
mean
air
conditioning
units
as
defined
in
paragraph
(c)
which
have
a
total
motor
horsepower
of
one
or
more
horsepower
as
to
the
case
in
a
(inaudible)
types
of

capacity
of
10,000
and
more
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
are
saying
is
right
or
wrong
that
the
commissioner
has
now
reached
a
conclusion
that
in
determining
a
self-contained
unit,
it
cannot
be
made
to
defend
consistently
with
the
statute
on
the
amount
of
horsepower
that
it
supposed
to
have.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
he
--
he
is
supplying
that
retroactively
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
as
an
engineer
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
an
engineering
matter,
is
it
a
practical
matter
that
this
horsepower
had
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
these
units
are
self-contained?
justice
william
o.
douglas
although
it
might
in
some
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
has
some
stipulation
on
page
51.
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
is
not
an
ex
parte
statement.
this
is
signed
by
the
--
your
attorney
as
well.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
--
the
words
has
consistently
held
as
pretty
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
he
paid
under
protest.
i
don't
know
what
more
he
want.
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
is
protected
by
the
regulation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
these
are
all
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
these
are
all
--
all
in
the
alternative,
as
i
see
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
doesn't
have
to
say
he
has
not
collected
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
public
utility
company
very
often
collects
rates
but
that
doesn't
--
there's
no
defense
to
its
reduction
because
it
has
already
collected
and
windfalls
are
--
and
reimbursement
to
the
consumers
is
a
part
of
the
whole
process.
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
is
this
not
raised
in
your
answer
then
if
this
is
your
defense?
i
don't
find
them.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
never
said
that
below.
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
is
the
first
time
this
point
emerges.
i
--
i
don't
understand
why
if
this
is
a
defense,
it
wasn't
brought
out
below
or
tendered
or
offered
or
argued.
