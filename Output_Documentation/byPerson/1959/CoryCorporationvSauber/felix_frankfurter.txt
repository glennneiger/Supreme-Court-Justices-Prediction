justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
stipulation,
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
see
them
before
i
find
out
whether
they
were
repudiated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you?
of
course
--
and
what
they
then
--
whatever
it
was
that
they
stipulated,
was
that
a
stipulation
regarding
the
1939
act,
is
that
it?
is
that
what
i'm
talking
about
correctly?
the
stipulation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
how
that
statute
can
be
construed
or
as
to
what
the
regulations
were?
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
it.
i
don't
know
it,
but
i
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
stipulation
and
as
the
chief
justice
asked
as
to
what
the
statute,
how
the
statute
is
to
be
construed,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
ultimate
question
of
law.
how
could
you
stipulate
away
the
whole
meaning
of
a
statute
which
is
under
contest?
i
just
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
remind
you
-
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
if
they're
agree
to
tell
me
that
by
this
stipulation,
you
were
cut
off
from
putting
in
witnesses
or
making
claims
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
otherwise,
you
would
have
made
it.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
tell
me
this.
am
i
wrong
in
drawing
the
inference
that
i
do
draw
from
what
you
just
said,
namely,
that
assuming
you're
right
about
everything
you've
said
in
this
implication,
you
--
you
are
not
entitled
to
ask
us
to
give
a
stipulated
construction
of
the
statute
but
you
maybe
entitled
to
say
that
the
case
should
go
back
so
that
the
issues
maybe
properly
canvassed.
which
are
you
asking
us
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
might
be
irrelevant
to
have
fair
determination
of
the
legal
question.
you
must
take
that
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
it
--
which
might
be
from
the
point
of
view
of
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
matter
of
law.if
you
are
shut
off
from
putting
in
defenses
or
making
claims
and
to
study
by
the
way
in
which
you
could
sustain
presumably
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
a
position
of
the
government
took
on
which
the
court
acted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
this
court
cannot
say
that
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
issue.
we
don't
care
even
if
you
prove
that,
it
would've
made
no
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
entitled
to
get
to
that
chance.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why,
because
we
made
the
stipulations
to
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
be
a
good
reason
for
sending
it
back
but
it
isn't
a
good
reason
for
this
court
to
give
a
wrong
constructions
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
want
to
know
what
it
is
that
you
may
properly
press
upon
this
court
for
a
decision.
and
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
the
fact
that
they
stipulated
their
view
of
the
statute
doesn't
foreclose
us
in
saying
that
that's
not
an
admissible
construction
of
the
statute.
and
it
may
be
that
it's
so
inadmissible
that
it's
immaterial
even
if
you've
been
allowed
to
having
made
it,
you
couldn't
have
put
in
that
proof
for
that
claim
because
so
it's
so
fancible.
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
i
don't
want
to
imply
it.
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is
exactly
that
you're
putting
to
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
you're
not
putting
to
the
court
that
we
must
give
a
construction
to
the
statute
because
the
government
misconceived
the
scope
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
swift
case,
which
is
somewhere
around
278
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
court
held
on
its
own
notion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sua
sponte
from
the
bench
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
whole
theory
on
which
the
litigation
was
conducted
is
to
be
swept
aside
because
conflict
between
them
put
up
a
litigation
to
this
court
which
did
not
represent
what
the
litigation
should
have
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
hurdles
all
questions
of
justice
harlan
had
just
said
and
hurdles
all
questions
of
stipulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
started
out
by
--
by
being
appropriately
outraged
if
your
starting
point
was
correct
that
the
government
is
--
that
this
is
a
question
of
judicial
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
according
to
the
statements
that
you've
just
accepted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
that's
the
conventional
claim
made
here
that
administrative
construction,
sometimes
the
government
use
it
and
sometimes
the
taxpaying
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
administrative
construction
compels
these
laws
on
a
dubious
statute
or
an
ambiguous
statute.
and
that
would
be
true
if
in
this
case,
counsel
of
the
government
hadn't
opened
his
mouth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
could
i
interrupt
you?
would
you
mind
stating
at
the
outset
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
pertinent
issue
that
this
case
present
on
this
record
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
don't
you
know
what
they
--
when
you
say
they
may
present,
what,
in
your
views,
are
the
issue
which
you
think
this
court
should
adjudicate
in
this
case
on
this
question,
not
what
it
makes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
--
if
i
may
ask
you
to
lead
me
through
this
thing,
as
would
an
eager
child,
these
cases
arise
out
of
the
1939,
1954
act.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
the
acts
themselves
are
ambiguous.
is
that
right
or
not?
i
can't
merely,
by
reading
a
statute,
give
an
answer
to
the
question,
is
that
right,
or
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
contending
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
i
don't
have
to
go
beyond
--
go
over
to
regulations
and
practice,
do
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
but
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
have
so
--
what
is
it
that
--
that
enables
me
to
satisfy
the
question
in
this
case
by
the
phrase
“self-contained”?
how
do
i
know
it's
self-contained?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
travelling
outside
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you're
not
reducing
a
--
a
phrase
that
isn't
in
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
have
you
go
from
statute
to
regulation
to
practice
in
order
to
find
out
what
is
in
controversy,
what
requires
me
to
construe
the
regulation
to
the
practice
in
order
to
answer
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
a
minute
ago,
i
don't
have
to
bother
about
any
of
these
things.
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
take
self-contained
unit
and
i
get
the
answer.
is
that
right?
that's
what
you
told
a
minute
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
is
that
self-contained
certainly
means,
what
ethel
barrymore
said
in
a
different
context,
that's
all
there
is,
and
that's
all
there
is,
it's
enough
not,
is
that
right?
that's
what
self-contained
means,
that
it
--
it
is
complete
within
itself.
you
don't
have
to
travel,
you
don't
have
to
do
anything
else,
you
don't
have
to
qualify
in
any
other
appliance
or
any
other
device
or
any
other
technique
there
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
self-contained
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
any
regulations
for
the
statute,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
--
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
issue
any
test
if
the
statute
affords
the
test?
what's
he
adding
to
the
statute
if
the
statute
speaks
with
clarity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
in
this
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
the
commissioner
subtract
from
what
congress
has
commanded
if
the
statute
is
what
you're
saying
is
then
no
regulation
of
his
can
cut
it
down.
it
can
illuminate
it
if
it's
doubtful.
but
it
can't
cut
it
down
if
it's
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
issue
in
the
case
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
--
do
you
mean
it's
not
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
--
so
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
case
comes
before
us
as
though
we
have
to
decide
what
he
would
have
to
pay
next
year
on
this
kind
of
units.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
--
suppose
he
were
to
make
such
a
claim,
what
would
he
--
he
make
that
--
he
has
to
--
what
will
he
do,
ask
for
return
of
what
he
--
he
couldn't
make
that
claim
and
say
that
claim
would
imply
that
he
relied
on
it
and
therefore,
he
didn't
pass
it
on
to
the
--
to
me
and
to
other
people.
and
therefore,
for
--
for
you
to
exact
it
now
would
be
violative
of
the
provisions
to
which
you
call
our
attention.
now,
where
would
he
assert
that
before
the
--
the
treasury
go
to
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
those
were
the
only
thing.
if
it's
denied,
then
the
case
would
come
here
of
a
demand
or
an
imposition
by
the
government
unfairly,
illegally
in
that
he
relied
upon
a
clear
regulation
which
even
if
it
was
wrong
or
invalid,
nevertheless,
puts
him
out
of
pocket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
the
--
the
customer
paid
for
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
--
you're
answering
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand,
in
your
answer
to
justice
black,
that
he
passed
on
his
tax
to
his
customers
that
he
paid
the
tax
under
protest
that
if
he
now
succeeds,
he
would've
already
gotten
the
amount
of
the
tax
from
the
customers
and
uncle
sam
will
double
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he
passed
it
on
and
he's
now
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
he'll
have
--
then
he'll
have
had
it
from
his
customers
and
then
from
the
treasury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes,
he
puts
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow
--
but
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
will
--
he
will
have
a
windfall
and
that
he
didn't
pay
the
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
6416
helps
them,
you
can
get
it
back
on
the
6416.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
6416,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
6416?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
which
he
--
suppose
justice
black's
condition
is
satisfied,
this
is
a
test
suit
for
the
50,000,
can
he
now
show
no
matter
what
this
court
decides,
suppose
the
court
decides
against
him
on
this
issue,
does
the
stipulation
or
anything
else
barring
him
to
--
for
making
a
complain
that
as
to
the
50,000
or
any
part
thereof,
he
in
fact
did
not
pass
the
tax
onto
the
customers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
did
not
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'd
like
to
put
another
thing
to
you.
it
may
not
--
a
manufacturer
may,
on
the
guides
of
passing
on
a
tax,
put
an
extra
imposition
upon
his
customers
and
he
may
have
--
the
manufacturer
may
have
done
that
in
this
case
and
still
claim
that
he
is
not
subject
to
this
tax
even
though
he
could
have
told
his
customer
and
he
was
so
that
there
are
two
questions
in
this
case.
one,
is
he
subject
to
a
tax?
never
mind
what
he's
relation
with
his
customers
are.
two,
if
in
fact
he
exacted
--
if
in
fact
he
relied
on
a
tax
which
he
now
challenges,
even
though
he
relied,
that
even
though
the
government
rightly
now
taxes
him
on
the
representations
made,
the
chief
justice
has
questioned
this
court,
he
relied
improperly
on
his
duty
to
not
to
pass
on
a
tax
which
you're
now
charging
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
the
fact
that
he
passed
it
on,
doesn't
settle
all
the
questions
in
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
go
within
the
--
the
power,
the
taxability
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
relevant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
relevant
to
the
claim
that
the
government
and
the
commissioner
is
now
going
back
on
his
regulation.
he
says
his
regulation
walks
out
on
him
for
some
such
phrase
as
justice
harlan
used
that
--
that
you
yourself
said.
the
commissioner
is
now
scuttling
regulations.
if
his
regulations
failed
him
or
properly
or
in
--
in
a
business
way
lead
a
manufacturer
to
pay
us
--
to
pass
on
that
tax
to
the
customer,
it
would
be
unfair
now
to
make
him
out
of
--
put
him
out
of
profit,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
there
are
two
very
distinct
questions.
one,
whether
in
fact
there
was
a
reliance
on
what
now
turns
out
to
be
an
invalid
or
an
enforceable
regulation
and
then
he
must
come
within
the
statutes
which
showed
that
he
did
rely
on,
would
be
out
of
pocket.
and
two,
a
totally
unrelated
question,
what
is
the
taxability
of
this
kind
of
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
stipulation
--
does
your
stipulation
--
is
your
stipulation
a
stipulation
that
bars
them
from
saying
as
to
the
none
two
cases,
the
other
50,000,
they
didn't
pass
it
on?
i
don't
think
your
stipulation
does
that.
it
merely
says
that
this
is
a
stipulation
as
to
the
scope
and
the
efficacy
of
the
--
of
the
ruling
of
the
commission,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
merits
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
legality
of
the
tax.
on
the
merits
of
the
legality
of
the
tax
not
to
be
passed
it
on
and
therefore,
he's
not
out
of
pocket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case,
but
would
they
as
to
the
50,000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
a
fact
that
they
were
--
isn't
a
fact
that
the
bone
of
contention
in
this
controversy
was
the
taxability
of
these
units,
is
that
right?
that's
what
the
litigation
was
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
litigation
was
the
government's
claim
to
have
a
right
to
tax
and
their
claim
that,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
regulation,
you
did
not
have
a
right
to
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
that
the
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
question,
his
collateral
question,
each
side
was
so
--
he
was
as
--
he
was
as
confident
on
his
reading
of
the
law
as
you
are
of
yours
and
the
question
whether
he's
entitled
to
get
a
refund
because
he
would
be
out
of
pocket
wasn't
in
--
perhaps
in
the
conscious
contemplation
of
the
parties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
know
it
was?
you're

they
didn't
merely
wanted
to
be
put

without
either

arguing
the

the

what's
the

the

tell

this.
is
it

is
it
strange

stipulate

there's

there

suppose
you
were

it
just
strikes

it's
a
