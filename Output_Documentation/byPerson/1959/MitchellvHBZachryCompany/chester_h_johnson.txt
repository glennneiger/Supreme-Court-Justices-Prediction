mr.
chester
h.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
prepared
to
make
a
few
remarks
in
connection
with
the
injunction
feature
but
in
the
light
of
the
questions
that
were
propounded
from
the
bench,
i'm
going
to
make
them
very
brief.
now,
i
do
hope
to
say
this
at
the
outset
that
my
--
my
colleague
here
we
subscribe
to
the
statement
contained
in
the
--
the
kirschbaum
case
that,
and
i'm
footnoting
mr.
moorhead's
statement
with
the
permission
of
the
court
that
we
do
subscribe
to
the
statement
in
kirschbaum
versus
walling
that
to
search
for
this
dependable
touchstone
is
by
which
to
determine
coverages
as
we
--
rewarding
as
the
attempt
to
square
the
circuit.
now,
we,
therefore,
recognize
the
problem
--
the
test
that
is
before
the
court.
and
--
but
however,
we
feel
and
sincerely
feel
that
the
problem
here
presented
in
this
case,
in
the
case
at
bar,
is
a
little
further
removed
from
any
other
case
that
has
thus
far
been
presented
to
the
court.
and
we
start,
of
course,
with
the
building
of
a
dam
of
a
local
stream
in
the
state
of
texas
which
when
completed
will
impound
water
which
will
in
turn
to
be
sold
to
a
municipal
corporation
which
will
in
turn
sell
and
distribute
that
water
to
a
miscellany
of
some
200,000
people
among
whom
are
some
little
and
thus
some
large
industrial
consumers
who,
in
turn,
produce
goods
for
commerce.
now,
there
is
a
considerable
distance
between
the
building
of
the
dam
and
the
actual
production
of
goods
for
commerce,
and
i
think
mr.
moorhead
has
covered
that
very
nicely.
now,
the
collateral
question
comes
up
at
--
in
the
event
this
court
determines
coverage.
and
that
is
that
the
trial
court
has
abused
his
discretion
in
limiting
or
attenuating
the
effect
of
the
injunction
so
granted.
now,
to
--
i
--
i
believe
i
should
address
myself
to
the
--
the
cases
cited
by
petitioner
rather
than
to
talk
about
the
cases
--
mr.
chester
h.
johnson
--
that
we
have
cited.
and
i
want
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
72
of
petitioner's
brief
wherein
the
mccomb
versus
jacksonville
paper
company
case
is
cited
for
the
proposition
--
i
believe
it
is
cited
from
the
proposition
that
a
mere
violation
of
the
act
of
the
--
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
entitles
the
--
the
petitioner
to
an
injunction
without
further
redo.
the
point
i
want
to
make
here
is
that
the
--
the
jacksonville
paper
company
case
was
strictly
--
it
wasn't
a
contempt
case.
and
there
is
simply
--
there
is
simply
a
great
distinction
between
a
hearing
on
a
contempt
order
than
a
hearing
or
an
application
for
an
injunction.
now,
further
pursuing
the
point,
petitioner
cites
this
court
to
the
union
tool
company
and
the
overnight
motor
company
case
at
pages,
i
believe,
at
67
or
68
of
the
brief.
likewise,
the
union
tool
company
case
was
--
it
was
a
contempt
case.
now,
it
issued
out
of
a
patent
infringement.
and
the
--
the
overnight
motor
company
case
was
a
liquidated
damage
case.
the
employee,
the
facts
being
clear,
the
employee
was
entitled
to
recover
the
liquidated
damages
as
a
matter
of
law.
there
--
there
was
nothing
left
in
either
of
those
cases
for
the
court's
discretion
to
be
applied
to
the
facts
were
clear
so
that
it
was
more
or
less
mandatory
that
remedial
relief
follow.
it
only
had
to
do
was
to
draw
the
order.
further
pursuing
the
point,
petitioner
would
cite
the
court,
and
i'm
trying
to
group
these
cases
rather
than
to
take
them
--
as
i've
cited
them
on
numerous
cases.
so
i'm
just
going
to
talk
about
two
cases,
i
believe,
that
--
that
were
injunction
cases.
the
--
for
instance,
we
cite
the
(inaudible)
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
circuit
which
is
so
condemned.
and
that
was
a
--
a
child
labor
violation
case,
a
very
flagrant
case.
the
only
reason
the
--
the
trial
court
did
not
wrap
the
injunction
was
that
he
believe
the
defendant
to
be
a
law-abiding
citizen.
and
he
didn't
believe
that
he
would
violate
the
law
anymore.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“that's
not
sufficient
to
withhold
the
grace
of
the
court.”
that
injunction
should
issue
--
had
so
many
further
excuses.
in
that
connection,
the
petitioner
cites
another
injunction
case
called
the
--
the
walling
versus
youngerman-reynolds
hardwood
company
case.
and
--
and
another
with
like
case
was
southwest
engineers
case
which
is
a
very
recent
one.
and
they
hold
to
--
as
about
the
same
effect.
now,
further
pursuing
the
point
in
there's
--
for
you
to
overcome
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
they
condemned
the
hodges
case
and
they
condemned
the
--
the
bland
case.
now,
the
hodges
case
reminds
me
very
much
of
--
of
the
situation
that
we
are
confronted
with.
there,
hodges
was
a
contractor.
he
had
11
--
he
performed
1100
contracts.
the
administrator
selected
five
of
those
contracts
to
test.
the
trial
court
found
that
--
that
three
of
those
cases,
there
was
no
coverage.
that
--
i
believe
that
three,
that
there
was
no
coverage
and
two
that
they
were
--
that
there
was
coverage
or
may
--
might
have
been
vice
versa,
but
an
appeal
was
taken.
the
court
though
withheld
the
injunction,
did
not
grant
it.
in
that
connection,
the
--
the
defendant
had
a
labor
counselor
who
it
had
hired
from
--
that
used
to
work
for
the
--
for
the
labor
department
or
the
wage
and
hour
department
to
counsel
with
it
to
help
it
to
--
along
its
way
to
keep
to
--
keep
down
the
infractions
of
the
labor
laws.
so
that
case
--
those
cases,
in
other
words,
the
--
the
--
are
in
keeping
with
the
general
trend
or
the
general
line
of
decisions
of
all
the
courts
that
say
that
--
that
if
the
facts
are
clear
and
if
the
cause
has
been
shown,
he
maybe
entitled
to
his
injunction
absent
any
mitigating
factors,
but
it's
usually
always
within
the
discretion
of
the
court.
now,
i
want
to
point
to
page
73
of
petitioner's
brief,
and
i'm
going
to
conclude.
they
complained
that
bitterly
of
the
prohibitive
cost
of
carrying
on
the
program
and
maintaining
a
constant
vigilance
over
these
employers.
i
especially
point
to
that
in
the
light
of
the
record
and
the
record
here
shows
that
--
that
respondent
had
a
legal
department
and
it
also
has,
in
its
employer,
pages
64
and
65
of
the
record,
a
man
whose
job
it
is
to
police
all
jobs
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
--
the
workers
on
the
payroll
in
a
proper
classification
even
under
davis-bacon
and
walsh-healey
as
well
as
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
to
minimize
any
infractions.
now,
in
spite
--
in
spite
of
all
these
efforts,
they
say
that
they
need
a
broad
blanket
injunction.
i'm
going
to
agree
with
them
that
it
is
costly
program.
i'm
further
saying
that
--
that
we're
doing
our
part
to
minimize
that
cost
and
we're
doing
the
best
we
can.
thank
you.
mr.
chester
h.
johnson
the
injunction
--
mr.
chester
h.
johnson
the
work
has
now
been
completed
and
that
--
that
injunction
then
would
die
with
the
exploration
of
the
job.
that
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
chester
h.
johnson
it
--
it
enjoin
the
--
the
defendant
from
violating
the
overtime
provisions
only
with
reference
to
that
specific
project.
yes,
sir.
mr.
chester
h.
johnson
it's
been
over
about
a
year
and
a
half,
i
guess,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
h.
johnson
two
years.
mr.
chester
h.
johnson
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
or
not,
your
honor.
