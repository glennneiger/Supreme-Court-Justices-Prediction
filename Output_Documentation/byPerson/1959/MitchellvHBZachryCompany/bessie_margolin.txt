mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
questions
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
federal
fair
labor
standards
act.
one
relating
to
the
--
in
coverage
--
a
coverage
question
and
the
other
relating
to
the
injunction
remedy
provided
to
restrain
violations
of
the
act.
the
coverage
question
is
whether
employees
engaged
in
the
construction
of
a
dam
and
reservoir
designed
to
replace
and
greatly
enlarge
the
water
supply
system
of
the
--
it's
for
the
city
of
corpus
christi
and
vicinity
--
corpus
christi,
texas
and
serving
the
industrial
users
as
well
as
other
water
users
in
that
area
many
of
--
of
whom
are
interstate
instrumentalities
and
industries
engaged
in
production
of
goods
for
interstate
commerce.
admittedly,
practically,
all
of
the
major
industries
in
corpus
christi
are
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
interstate
commerce.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
wouldn't
undertake
to
say
what
is
navigable.
we
certainly
do
not
rely
upon
any
navigability
question
being
involved
here.
it's
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
enlargement
and
improvement
of
this
water
supply
system
which
concededly
serves
substantially,
interstate
instrumentalities
and
interstate
producers
of
goods
for
commerce
and
is
essential
to
the
functioning
of
those
instrumentalities
and
to
the
productive
processes
of
the
interstate
producers,
whether
that
is
a
production
of
goods
for
commerce
within
the
statutory
definition.
now,
the
district
court
held
relying
primarily
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
vollmer
and
the
--
and
the
alstate
and
i
assume
they
--
cleveland
had
been
down
that
would've
been
another
one
of
the
decisions.
on
the
principles
of
those
decisions,
that
the
construction
project
here
was
so
vitally
and
directly
related
and
essential
to
the
continued
operation
and
functioning
of
interstate
instrumentalities
and
the
producers
of
goods
for
commerce
in
corpus
christi
and
vicinity,
that
the
--
that
the
employees
actually
constructing
the
dam
and
reservoir
were
engaged
in
production
of
goods
for
commerce
on
two
grounds.
one,
he
said,
“they
were
engaged
in
the
actual
production
of
goods
under
the
principle
of
the
alstate
decision.”
that
is
the
production
of
water
which
was
to
be
used
and
was
essential
to
the
operation
of
interstate
instrumentalities.
and
the
second
ground
was
that
it
was
--
they
were
engaged
in
occupations
of
processes
closely
related
and
directly
essential
to
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
--
although
the
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
coverage
of
these
employees,
the
district
court,
it
issued
an
injunction.
it
declined
to
issue
the
injunction
requested
by
the
government
and
limited
in
its
injunction
restraining
violations
to
this
particular
project
which
was
virtually
completed
at
the
time
of
--
of
judgment.
ms.
bessie
margolin
we
asked
for
an
injunction
restraining
violations
in
the
future
on
projects
which
--
will
end
the
coverage
or
within
the
coverage
of
the
act,
are
in
the
alternative,
we
suggested
that
at
least
we
should
have
an
injunction
enjoining
the
violations
on
the
similar
projects
within
the
--
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
coverage
issue
and
therefore,
did
not
reach
the
question
raised
by
the
government's
cross-appeal,
which
was
whether
the
court
had
--
had
not
transcended
its
legal
discretion,
its
judicial
discretion.
and
so
--
and
so
limiting
the
relief
granted.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
that
was
the
sole
basis
for
asserting
coverage
here.
but
on
--
on
two
grounds,
the
definition
of
production
as
--
is
in
two
parts.
one
is
production,
actual
production
which
is
manufacturing,
mining,
i
think,
it's
on
page
--
it's
in
our
appendix,
quoted
in
our
appendix
page
--
pardon
me.
page
82
and
the
courts
have
pointed
out
and
so
has
congress
itself
that
this
is
in
two
parts.
the
first
part,
which
is
primary
our
actual
production,
includes
manufacturing,
mining,
handling
or
in
any
manner
working
on
goods.
and
the
second
part
is
engaged
in
any
closely
related
process
or
occupation
directly
essential
to
production
thereof.
that
becomes
important
because
only
that
part
of
the
definition
of
production
was
amended
by
the
1949
amendments.
both
the
house
and
the
senate
pointed
out
they
were
leaving
untouched
the
primary
production,
so
that,
the
part
of
our
case
that
rests
on
primary
production
was
fully
unaffected
by
the
1949
amendment.
ms.
bessie
margolin
talking
about
the
production
of
water
that
its
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
is
itself
--
well,
we
don't
rely
primarily
on
the
ingredient
point
because
that
wasn't
developed
here,
but
which
is
produced
for
an
essential
interstate
use
for
the
functioning
of
interstate
instrumentalities
just
as
the
broad
materials
were
produced
in
--
in
the
alstate
case
for
in
quotes,
“for”
commerce,
for
use
in
the
--
in
repairing
and
improving
interstate
highways
and
interstate
instrumentalities.
we
say
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
it's
--
for
locomotives,
were
used
by
our
freight
transportation
companies,
for
such
operations
as
they
need
water
part
at
airports,
fire
protection
or
--
or
it's
within
going
to
the
details
as
to
the
uses
of
the
waters,
to
the
functioning
of
the
interstate
instrumentalities
because
it
was
conceded
and
the
judge
in
--
in
an
effort
to
cut
down
the
amount
of
evidence
that
went
in
--
seek
--
got
counsel
to
concede
that
large
quantities
of
water
were
used
by
the
interstate
instrumentalities
for
their
functioning,
for
purposes
of
functioning,
carrying
on
their
functions
and
it
was
essential
to
their
use.
ms.
bessie
margolin
now,
on
the
second
part,
we
also
say
that
although
not
developed
in
this
record,
unquestionably,
some
of
this
water
went
out
the
state.
we
have
not
placed
reliance
on
that,
we
did
not
in
the
court
below,
but
we
felt
that
the
court
--
the
argument
should
be
presented
to
the
court
because
it
is
unquestionably
so
that
some
of
these
--
some
water
goes
out
the
state.
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
the
scope
of
the
production.
it
also
--
it
went
further
and
held
that
the
1949
amendment
to
production
coverage
was
intended
to
exclude
construction
projects
or
as
local
enterprises.
we
think
it's
significant
that
it's
admitted
here
by
respondent
that
if
this
were
--
were
just
simply
to
repair
or
maintain
the
existing
water
system
that
it
would
still
be
within
the
coverage
of
the
act,
as
closely
related
and
directly
essential.
at
least,
i
don't
understand
them
to
deny
that
and
as
i
shall
later
point
out
the
--
the
cases,
the
decisions
have
long
since
settled
that
and
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
expressly
approved
the
coverage
of
--
of
maintenance
and
repair
of
this
type
of
utility.
respondents
also
assert
that
they
--
they
don't
put
any
special
--
attach
any
special
importance
to
the
new
construction
doctrine.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
they
come
pretty
close
to
abandoning
the
fifth
circuit's
reliance
on
that
doctrine.
they
say
that
certainly,
the
language,
at
least
the
language
of
vollmer
and
alstate
and
lublin
should
be
applied
as
much
to
production
coverage
as
in
commerce
coverage.
and
that
in
general,
the
liberal
construction
doctrine
should
apply.
but
they
also
say
that
if
--
if
this
were
a
case
where
the
water
--
the
dam
and
reservoir
were
being
constructed
solely
or
primarily
for
interstate
producers
and
interstate
instrumentalities,
then
they
concede
that
there
would
be
a
forceful
case
for
holding
that
the
employees
here
were
closely
related
and
directly
essential
to
production
of
goods
by
the
producers
within
the
area.
their
argument
turns
largely,
if
not
entirely,
on
their
construction
of
the
amendment
to
the
production
coverage
of
the
act
in
1949.
and
respondent
like
the
court
of
appeals
below
doesn't
spend
much
time
on
the
other
grounds
on
which
the
district
court
upheld
coverage
the
alstate
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
that
as
--
said
--
assumed
that
the
government
wasn't
relying
on
it
mistakenly
and
their
only
comment
was
that
the
employees
here
certainly
weren't
producing
any
goods
for
commerce
when
they
were
construction
the
dam
that
they
were
--
they
were
simply
producing
the
dam.
our
--
our
answer
to
that
is
that
this
is
the
way
you
produce
waters
to
construct
the
dam.
it's
an
engineering
fact
that
you
produce
water
by
constructing
a
dam
and
a
reservoir.
just
like
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
you
impound
it
and
they've
--
and
--
and
producing
is
very
broadly
defined
in
the
act,
actual
producing
it's
--
is
like
you
drill
--
drill
wells
for
oil
or
you
mine
--
dig
and
mine
for
coal
and
that
this
is
as
much
producing
water
as
the
mining
of
coal
is
producing
coal
of
a
digging
--
drilling
of
oil
wells
is
producing
oil
so
that
the
--
we
don't
need
to
minimize
that
ground
of
coverage
when
we
direct
most
of
our
brief
in
answering
the
arguments
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondents.
they
do
not
give
any
answer
to
that
and
that
is
still,
we
think,
a
--
a
sufficient
basis
of
coverage.
coming
though
to
there
--
in
--
to
the
interpretation
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1949
amendment
to
production,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
didn't
have
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
to
decide
that
congress
intended
to
expand
the
local
enterprises
that
it
was
removing
from
the
act
and
it
obviously
assumed
that
what
it
did
was
to
extract
a
part
of
the
reasoning
from
this
court's
office
building
case
in
callus
and
relating
to
the
performing
activities
of
--
of
rendering
services
for
a
miscellany
of
customers.
and
relying
heavily
on
--
on
that
reference
to
callus,
the
court
said
that
this
type
of
service
to
a
miscellany
of
customers
was
intended
to
be
excluded
as
local
enterprise.
and
this,
in
effect,
is
respondents'
argument
as
i
think
is
evident
from
their
--
from
their
admission
that
if
--
if
this
facility
was
designed
primarily
as
solely
deserved
interstate
producers
and
interstate
instrumentalities,
then
it
could
forcefully
be
contended
that
the
employees
were
covered
as
closely
related
and
directly
essential.
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondents'
argument
rest
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
a
legislative
intent
in
1949
to
very
substantially
curtail
the
scope
of
coverage.
they
--
respondents
said
so
in
so
many
words.
now,
he
--
respondent
does
look
to
some
of
the
legislative
history
just
the
house
report
and
only
parts
of
the
house
report.
the
court
of
appeals
below
didn't
look
at
any
of
the
legislative
history.
respondents,
however,
interpret
what
legislative
history
they
looked
at
in
the
same
way
that
apparently
the
court
below
interpreted
it.
and
i
did
want
to
say
a
word
in
answer
to
the
court
of
appeals
reliance
on
the
new
construction
doctrine
since
the
court
clearly
relied
pretty
heavily
on
it.
it
was
the
only
basis
on
which
it
differed
from
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
chambers
case,
where
the
eighth
circuit
had
pointed
out
that
the
vollmer
decision
didn't
establish
anything
new,
it
was
just
asserting
the
principle
that
had
applied
generally
to
the
act's
coverage,
and
that
this
type
of
improvement
are
enlargement
of
an
existing
facility.
it
had
always
been
ruled
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
that
original
construction
which
had
previously
been
thought
to
be
by
some
outside
the
scope
of
that
--
of
the
act
in
which
the
administrator
had
earlier
thought
might
be
a
basis
for
determining
coverage
on
this
act
meant
something
quite
different
from
improvement
and
enlargement
or
expansion.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
obviously
treated
this
as
new
construction.
and
our
position
is
that
whatever
remains
of
the
new
construction
doctrine
in
either
phase
of
coverage,
it
clearly
--
this
court's
rulings
have
established
that
this
does
not
apply
to
an
improvement
or
an
enlargement
or
--
or
an
expansion
if
that
falls
in
the
same
category
as
repair
and
maintenance.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
at
all
to
--
relating
to
new
construction.
the
legislative
reports
did
make
clear
both
house
and
senate
reports
stated
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
it
was
not
the
intent
to
make
any
drastic
change
in
--
in
the
scope
of
coverage.
the
house
report,
i
should
point
out
that
there
was
a
divergence
of
--
between
the
house
and
senate
proposals
originally.
the
senate
didn't
want
to
make
any
change
in
the
definition
of
coverage,
production
coverage.
the
house
had
proposed
a
more
drastic
language
of
closely
related
and
indispensable.
the
language,
if
the
act
is
enacted
was
a
--
a
compromise,
and
the
reports
of
the
senate
and
house,
i
think,
are
the
best
evidence
of
what
that
compromise
was
intended
to
accomplish.
the
house
committee
report
stated
explicitly,
the
amended
section
gives
the
courts
a
more
specific
guide
as
to
the
intention
of
congress.
it
does
not,
however,
radically
revise
the
coverage
of
the
act
as
it
has
been
interpreted
by
the
courts
in
the
past.
and
this
--
and
the
senate
conferees
report
also
stated
that
it
was
not
intended
to
substantially
change
and
limit
the
decisions
construing
the
prior
necessary
to
production
language
but
rather
to
provide
more
certainty
in
this
field.
and
the
senate
report
specifically
stated
that
the
amended
language
adopts
the
standard
of
closely
related
which
the
supreme
court
has
supplied
in
most
of
its
decisions
interpreting
coverage.
ms.
bessie
margolin
on
page
45
of
our
brief.
and
then
the
senate
report
went
on
and
said
that
the
amendatory
language
is
descriptive
of
activities
which
although
not
an
integral
part
of
productive
operations
have
a
relationship
to
production
which
may
reasonably
be
considered
close
as
distinguished
from
a
remote
entanglers
and
contemplates
activities
which
are
directly
a
production
in
a
practical
sense
by
providing
something
essential
to
carrying
on
in
an
effective,
efficient
and
satisfactory
manner
of
operations
which
are
a
part
of
an
integrated
effort
for
the
production
of
goods.
now,
we
say
that
that
language
comes
very
close
to
the
test
this
court
has
established
for
determining
whether
activities
are
within
the
in
commerce
coverage.
in
the
vollmer
case,
the
court
stated
that
the
test
was
whether
the
work
is
so
directly
and
vitally
related
to
the
functioning
of
an
instrumentality
or
facility
of
interstate
commerce
as
to
be
in
practical
effect
a
part
of
it
rather
than
isolated
local
activity.
and
in
the
lublin
case,
i'm
relating
to
the
plans
and
specifications
for
improvement
of
interstate
instrumentalities,
the
court
say
--
stated
that
it
was
whether
the
work
is
directly
and
vitally
related
to
the
functioning
of
those
interstate
facilities.
now,
that
language,
i
think
--
we
think
parallel
so
closely
the
--
the
senate
and
house
or
the
legislative
statements
as
to
what
they
intended
by
this
closely
related
and
directly
essential
language
that
it
follows
that
work
which
is
just
as
vitally
and
directly
and
closely
related
to
production
of
goods
for
commerce
as
where
the
lock
in
dams
and
--
and
the
lock
in
dam
and
the
lock
in
canal
and
the
plans
and
specifications
in
the
vollmer
and
lublin
cases
that
there's
no
more
reason
for
more
restrictive
they
are
--
more
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
production
coverage
as
amended
in
1949.
now,
the
--
prior
to
1949
as
the
eighth
circuit
pointed
out,
it
was
settled
that
the
production
coverage
was
much
more
flexible
and
broader
than
the
in
commerce
coverage.
so
that
the
position
of
respondent
and
of
the
court
below
is
that
by
the
1949
amendment,
congress
reversed
the
situation
that
production
coverage
now
is
not
even
coextensive
with
the
in
commerce
coverage
that
it's
narrower
and
more
rigid.
in
addition
to
the
general
statements
in
both
house
and
senate
reports
stating
that
they
did
not
intend
to
have
such
a
drastic
change
in
their
scope
of
production
--
production
coverage,
the
specific
cases
were
mentioned
--
were
listed
in
both
reports
more
in
the
senate
than
in
the
house
state
--
stating
what
they
specifically
did
not
intend
to
change
as
to
the
scope
of
production
coverage.
and
significantly,
most
significantly
among
those
cases
were
the
public
utility
cases
producing
and
supplying
electricity,
gas,
fuel,
water,
specifically
mentioning
water
among
those,
the
manufacturing
of
tools
and
dies
and
machinery
to
be
used
by
other
producers
of
goods
and
production
of
other
goods
for
commerce
and
custodial
and
maintenance
service
furnished
by
an
independent
firm
that
might
be
serving
customers
generally.
in
fact
all
of
these
--
these
--
in
these
three
areas
which
both
house
and
senate
reports
endorsed
and
stated
specifically
would
remain
within
the
coverage
of
the
act,
our
typical
examples
of
--
of
facilities
serving
a
general
miscellany
of
customers
but
also
well-known
to
be
vitally
essential
--
vitally
and
substantially
essential
to
the
production
of
any
goods
for
commerce.
ignoring
all
of
these
specific
examples
approved
by
both
houses,
respondent
relies
primarily
if
not
entirely
on
a
few
examples
in
the
house
report
which
the
house
said
it
understood
that
the
language
would
exclude
from
the
coverage
in
two
cases
that
respondents
rely
on,
particularly
the
super-a
fertilizer
case
and
which
was
a
decision
of
the
first
circuit.
i
might
point
out
that
except
for
the
window
washing
case,
neither
house
nor
senate
report
disapproved
any
decision
of
this
court.
they
specifically
approved
the
test
of
kirschbaum.
they
said
they
intended
--
both
houses
said
they
intended
to
adopt
the
immediate
--
close
and
immediate
trial
test
of
kirschbaum.
and
--
that
only
--
not
the
senate
but
the
house
said
that
it
objected
to
holding
at
an
industrial
window
washing
company
was
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
now,
the
--
in
strictest
logic
some
of
the
things
the
--
the
house
said
would
be
excluded
by
the
language
if
you
apply
it
in
constrict
logic,
it
might
be
hard
to
reconcile
those
cases
with
the
cases
they
explicitly
said
they
intended
to
remain
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
but
the
--
certainly,
that
is
no
grounds
for
overwriting
the
joint
intent
as
to
the
types
of
cases,
both
houses
intended
to
retain
under
the
act.
and
there
certainly
no
reason
for
extending
those
cases,
beyond
what
even
the
house
suggested,
they
should
go
in
order
to
narrow
the
coverage
of
the
act.
moreover,
the
cases
are
distinguishable.
the
super-a
fertilizer
case
was
the
production
of
fertilizer
used
by
farmers
to
produce
sugarcane
--
to
fertilize
the
soil
for
production
of
sugarcane.
and
it's
hard
to
reconcile
that
with
a
specific
approval
of
the
reynolds
water
case
which
the
senate
report
specifically
said
they
intended
to
endorse
and
would
continue
within
the
coverage.
but
apparently,
the
--
they
could
be
reconciled
and
are
distinguishable
on
the
basis
that
fertilizer,
although
useful
in
the
production
of
goods
is
not
thought
to
be
as
vitally
essential
as
water
and
fuel
and
electricity
and
gas
and
heat
and
tools
and
dies
and
machinery.
the
other
case
on
which
respondent
relies
and
which
is
cited
in
the
house
report
is
the
schroeder
case,
the
production
--
the
quarrying
of
rock
for
the
construction
of
a
dike
which
was
to
protect
an
oil
field
from
being
flooded
by
a
government
project.
the
respondent
emphasizes
that
case
because
he
says
it's
like
this
one
because
it's
a
construction
of
a
dam.
but
the
--
the
purposes
are
obviously
quite
different.
but
apart
from
that,
it's
significant
that
the
house
report
just
says
they
disapproved
of
holding
the
quarry
employees.
the
employees
quarrying
the
rock
and
significantly,
did
not
say
that
they
disapproved
of
covering
the
employees
engaged
in
the
actual
construction
of
the
dike.
and
of
course,
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
employees
engaged
in
the
actual
construction
of
this
dam
and
reservoir.
the
window
washing
case
in
the
same
way
--
in
fact
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
supplies
and
materials,
the
fertilizer
and
the
rock
and
window
washing
could
be
said
to
be
services
or
supplies
which
are
not
vitally
essential
to
the
productive
process
whereas
plainly
water,
live
electricity,
gas
and
--
and
coal
and
fuel
and
tools
and
dies
and
machinery
is
absolutely
vital
and
essential
to
the
production
to
--
of
any
goods
for
interstate
commerce.
we
want
to
spend
a
few
minutes
on
the
injunction
point
and
then
reserve
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
conceive
our
strongest
argument
to
be
that
the
utility
cases
that
congress
expressly
approved
cases
like
the
florida
power
and
light,
the
--
also
the
mccrady
case
which
was
a
new
--
construction
of
new
plants
for
an
existing
steel
company
and
some
of
these
were
new
plants
and
was
related
to
that
particular
company.
i
think
the
utility
cases,
the
maintenance
and
repair
cases
and
the
custodial
cases
and
the
west
kentucky-florida
power
and
light,
the
coal
company,
gas
case
and
electric
cases
and
the
reynolds
water
and
farmers
reservoir
cases
which
were
approved
by
congress.
now,
those
were
cases
where
the
water
was
being
furnished
to
exclusively,
almost
exclusively
for
farmers.
but
our
point
is
that
obviously
that
was
not
the
--
a
determinative
factor
with
congress
in
approving
these
cases
because
the
general
utilities
do
not
furnish
exclusively
or
even
primarily
to
industries.
in
this
case,
it's
submitted
that
some
40%
to
50%
of
this
water
supply,
of
the
existing
water
supply
was
devoted
to
industrial
uses.
and
that
practically,
all
the
industrial
users
in
corpus
christi
produced
goods
for
interstate
commerce.
and
it's
been
settled
and
generally
and
consistently
held
and,
as
i
say,
the
legislative
history
of
that
1949
amendment
approved
it
obviously
that
it's
the
substantial
and
regular
need
and
use
of
the
facility
for
interstate
commerce
and
not
that
it
must
be
primarily
or
solely
devoted
to
that
use
that
invokes
the
coverage
of
the
act.
so
that
i
say
that
all
these
utility
cases
and
the
repair
and
maintenance
holding,
that
the
repair
and
maintenance
and
protection
of
utilities,
facilities
that
unless
you
adopt
a
new
construction
give
the
broad
interpretation
to
the
new
construction
doctrine
and
apply
it
technically,
you
cannot
distinguish
this
between
the
repair,
maintenance
and
protection
of
the
existing
facility
which
has
been
consistently
held
covered.
that
the
fact
that
it's
a
large
and
a
big
--
a
big
plant
and
a
large
construction
project
does
not
make
it
any
less
closely
related
or
directly
essential
to
supplying
that
absolutely
essential
and
directly
necessary
facility
for
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
and
that
the
same
principles
of
the
--
we
--
we
rely
on
the
principles
of
the
of
vollmer
and
lublin
case
and
with
respect
to
the
practical
considerations
which
show
that
this
is
vital
and
essential.
and
that
what
is
vital
and
essential
to
the
functioning
of
interstate
instrumentalities
under
those
decisions
is
equally
closely
related
and
directly
essential
to
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
under
the
production
coverages.
and
that
or
neither
the
court
below
nor
respondent
has
taken
issue
with
--
with
the
fact
that
--
that
this
water
supply
is
just
as
closely
related
and
directly
essential
and
vital
to
the
producers
of
goods
for
commerce
and
interstate
instrumentalities
as
was
the
construction
of
the
lock
and
canal
in
--
in
vollmer
to
the
interstate
traffic
on
that
water-way
or
the
plans
and
specifications
in
lublin
were
to
the
interstate
uses
of
the
instrumentalities
there
being
improved.
no
issue
has
been
taken
with
the
--
with
practical
fact
that
the
relationship
and
the
--
and
the
vital
essentiality
of
this
water
supply
is
equally
close
and
direct
as
--
as
the
facilities
in
those
cases.
coming
then
to
the
injunction
point,
we
recognize,
of
course,
that
the
issuance
of
injunctive
relief
is
largely
discretionary
with
the
trial
court.
but
we
believe
this
case
illustrates
that
what
is
becoming
or
something
of
a
problem
in
the
lower
courts
particularly
in
this
region
where
most
the
violations
of
--
large
proportion
have
been
appear
that
they're
taking
a
mistaken
view
of
the
purpose
and
nature
of
the
injunction
and
thus
really
obstructing
enforcement
and
compliance
rather
than
encouraging
it
or
helping
to
deter
violation.
the
attitude
has
been
that
the
employer
should
be
absolutely
unfettered
in
--
in
contesting
doubtful
coverage
questions,
questions
which
he
in
good
faith
thinks
may
be
doubtful
or
if
he
relies
in
good
faith
on
advice
of
--
of
counsel.
and
that
this
is
sufficient
reason
not
to
give
any
relief
and
in
effect
relief
was
denied
here
because
that
one
project
was
virtually
completed.
this
attitude,
we
think,
just
encourages
employers
to
contest
and
litigate
or
take
or
decide
not
to
comply
until
they
have
an
opportunity
to
litigate
because
they
have
absolutely
nothing
to
lose
not
even
the
--
they
can
be
even
pretty
sure
they're
not
going
to
be
enjoined
for
the
future.
and
meanwhile,
they're
underpaying
their
employees
if
it's
later
determined
that
they
held
covered
--
covered.
and
they
stand
to
retain
in
--
permanently,
again
they
acquired
during
--
during
this
period
if
they're
litigating.
well,
it
is
true
that
the
congress
in
section
17
when
it
denied
the
courts
the
power
to
grant
restitution
for
past
violations
apparently,
intended
to
give
the
employer
at
least
one
bite
of
the
--
the
apple
free
if
he
wants
to
contest
coverage,
then
they
would
leave
it
just
to
the
employee
remedy.
but
in
enacting
that
provision,
congress
made
it
clear
that
it
was
not
saying
that
in
a
contempt
action,
the
court
couldn't
compel
compliance
by
ordering
past
payment
of
wages.
but
the
only
way
that
the
court
can
really
compel
that
type
of
compliance
is
if
it
first
issues
an
injunction.
now,
the
courts
have
also
said
something
about
employ
--
employers
should
not
be
required
to
act
if
they're
peril
to
--
in
the
future.
and
this
is
what
they
conceive
the
injunction
is
doing
apparently.
well,
all
of
the
--
i
think
they
overlook
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
injunction
under
this
act
which
is
not
like
and
extraordinary
equity
injunction.
it
requires
nothing
except
that
they
comply
with
what
the
act
--
the
duties
the
act
imposes
on
them
in
any
event.
and
they're
not
subject
to
any
peril
of
criminal
contempt
if
they
in
good
faith
believe
they
are
not
covered
--
it
--
because
criminal
contempt
has
to
be
a
willful
violation.
and
they
have
every
opportunity
to
present
to
the
court
after
an
injunction
has
been
issued
any
doubtful
coverage
questions.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
courts
--
the
trial
courts
should
give
more
consideration
to
public
interest
and
the
burdens
and
that
when
cause
has
been
shown
for
the
--
for
the
issuance
of
an
injunction,
where
there
has
been
a
prior
record
of
considerable
investigations
and
finding
of
violations
there
were
a
total
of
eight
investigations
here
within
--
this
is
our
second
law
suit
with
this
company.
and
this
case
illustrates,
i
think,
what
--
of
what
can
happen
by
--
to
these
narrow
injunctions.
we
had
a
case
in
new
mexico
against
the
same
company.
they
were
building
runways
at
the
holloman
airfield
in
new
mexico.
and
we
got
an
injunction
in
that
case.
they
were
litigating
on
what
we
thought
was
a
rather
frivolous
grounds
but
it
was
--
that
it
was
an
instrumentality
of
war
and
not
of
commerce
and
they
distinguished
this
court's
decision
in
powell
where
--
where
the
court
held
that
the
fact
that
production
of
ammunitions
was
for
war,
it
mean
it
couldn't
be
for
commerce.
they
distinguished
that
case
on
the
same
grounds
they're
urging
here.
that
in
commerce
coverage
is
quite
different
from
production
and
therefore
powell
didn't
apply
to.
ms.
bessie
margolin
powell
being
a
production
of
a
case
they
said
it
didn't
apply
to
in
commerce.
well,
we
thought
it
was
a
frivolous
grounds
but
this
is
what
the
denial
of
injunction
encouraged
it
--
them
to
litigate
on
--
on
every
ground
possible.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
sorry
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
except
that
i'm
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
because
this
injunction
does
not
compel
them
to
do
anything,
it
doesn't
compel
them
to
restore
any
past
benefits
they
have.
they
just
go
to
any
advantages
they
may
have
acquired
at
the
expense
of
competitors
to
--
to
make
restitution
to
employees.
it
doesn't
require
anything
except
that
in
the
future,
they
--
they
assume
the
risk
of
doubt
as
to
coverage.
and
all
that
risk
is
--
all
that
risk
is,
is
that
they
paid
the
employees
in
accordance
with
the
act.
they
can
--
the
court
is
then
in
the
position
to
order
them
to
comply
really.
it's
the
first
time
the
court
gets
in
the
position
to
order
them
to
comply
is
after
it
issues
an
injunction.
and
what
we
say
is
when
there
have
been
a
past
record
of
violations,
where
we'd
have
to
inspect
several
times
that
the
burden
and
expense
to
the
government
is
a
consideration
which
the
trial
court
has
said
it
wasn't
impressed
with
the
fact
that
we'd
already
made
eight
investigations
and
had
two
lawsuits
and
that
the
employer
had
been
found
to
have
owed
some
$4000
and
the
other
lawsuit
which
there
was
never
any
indication
he
ever
paid
off.
and
admittedly
here,
if
this
coverage
here,
it's
admitted
that
there's
been
some
$50,000
underpayments
in
overtime.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
we
say
that
if
it's
ultimately
determined
that
they're
covered
and
they
have
a
past
record
of
--
of
leaning
over
backwards
to
resolve
doubts
in
their
favor
and
they've
already
acquired
certain
considerable
financial
advantage
from
that,
at
--
at
that
time,
the
court
ought
to
step
in
and
help
us
enforce
this
act
because
otherwise,
they're
just
encouraging
untenable
litigation
and
contest.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
say
--
well,
we
think
there's
some
basis
--
basis
for
thinking
they
weren't
covered
and
we
don't
--
this
is
the
standards
that
they
have
seen
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
ruled
that
we
were
right.
that
the
employer
gets
wrong.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
they
say
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
they
don't
think
there's
any
need
for
an
injunction
because
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
--
they
say
they
don't
think
there's
any
need
for
one
and
that
they
--
if
there
is
--
there's
no
need
for
one
where
there's
clear
coverage
they
say.
and
if
--
where
there's
doubtful
coverage,
they
should
be
able
to
go
into
court
unfettered
by
any
injunction.
and
that
they
obviously
regard
this
--
the
injunction
as
being
two
burdens
among
the
employer
without
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
complying.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
the
employee
usually
tells
the
court
that
if
you
hold
uncover
and
i'm
willing
to
comply.
and
--
and
the
court
--
the
trial
courts
have
been
accepting
that
pretty
readily
without
considering
what
the
meaning
of
the
injunction
in
the
effect
of
it
is.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we've
had
considerable
recurrence
of
violations
by
and
we've
had
had
to
go
back
and
--
and
try
to
get
another.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
no,
not
particular,
and
that
--
this
is
the
point.
they'll
contest
as
to
some
other
employees
or
some
other
activity
or
raise
an
exemption
question.
i
mean
it
--
you
can
always
distinguish
cases.
ms.
bessie
margolin
if
we
--
the
injunction
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
it
--
we
would
go
in
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
we
would
not
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
certainly,
not
a
criminal
contempt.
we'd
simply
go
in
and
--
and
ask
for
contempt
action
and
--
a
civil
contempt
to
require
fines.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
practically,
it
amounts
to
construction
of
the
injunction
but
it
puts
the
court
in
a
position
to
give
us
some
--
some
real
relief
and
to
get
real
compliance
which
is
--
which
you
can't
get
if
--
if
without
the
injunction.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
think
that
under
this
act,
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
remedy
because
all
it
requires
is
not
like
the
antitrust
acts,
where
you
may
have
--
you
may
enjoin
legal
and
illegal
acts
because
of
their
context.
here,
you've
just
got
something
straight
statutory
duty
and
that's
all
the
injunction
requires.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
have
--
the
reason
i
have
is
because
the
--
because
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
have
pointed
out
that
if
there
is
a
great
deal
of
discretion
here,
that
there
maybe
some
good
reasons
why
a
particular
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
--
i
think
that
we
have
had
cases
where
we
have
an
appeal,
where
we
ourselves
were
convinced
that
the
employer
would
comply
as
soon
as
he
got
a
coverage
issue
determined.
and
there
had
been
no
other
record.
he'd
always
shown
cooperation
in
the
past,
and
we
had
not
had
any
expense
and
--
and
litigation
wherein
many
have
passed.
we
--
we
asked
for
an
injunction
but
we
don't
appeal
a
denial
under
those
circumstances.
but
we
do
think
that
where
--
where
there's
been
a
record
of
--
of
noncompliance
in
the
past
and
we're
all
forced
to
--
they
may
contest
and
litigate
every
point
to
the
bitter
end
and
put
the
government
to
that
extent.
at
that
time,
we
need
--
we
need
some
court
assistance
in
the
enforcement.
and
certainly,
the
--
the
--
we
need
some
guarding
standards
that
don't
encourage
employers
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
this
is
on
the
question
as
to
when
an
injunction
--
what
are
the
standards
for
determining
the
exercise
of
sound
discretion.
now,
the
courts
--
these
--
the
courts
in
this
region
have
been
ignoring
any
--
any
burden
on
the
government
to
have
to
constantly
investigate
and
--
or
go
to
the
expense
of
litigating.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i'll
--
i'll
say
--
well,
i
--
i
say
that
in
--
in
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
in
some
areas
of
the
country,
i'm
afraid
they're
not.
ms.
bessie
margolin
because
they're
--
particularly,
under
the
standards
which
the
courts
--
which
some
of
the
courts
have
announced.
and
that
is
that
you
--
you
have
perfect
freedom
to
litigate.
if
--
if
you
have
a
case
you
think
distinguishable
from
the
one
that's
been
decided,
you
--
you
can
--
you
have
--
we
don't
want
to
put
any
--
any
restriction
on
you.
you
can
go
into
court
and
litigate
it
and
you
shouldn't
be
in
any
way
restrain.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
--
i
could
say
some
that
it
should
not
include
which
are
--
are
being
followed
in
this
district.
and
apparently
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
some
of
the
fifth
circuit
standards.
the
good
faith
reliance
on
--
on
--
by
advice
of
counsel
encourages
counsel
to
give
the
advice
that
the
employer
wants
and
we
have
a
lot
of
experience
of
that,
it's
become
a
stock
excuse
that
i
relied
on
advising
of
counsel.
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
are
good
--
or
to
say
that
just
the
fact
that
there
might
be
a
doubt
as
to
coverage
is
not
enough,
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
denying
an
injunction
that
the
interest
of
the
public
and
the
--
the
extent
to
which
employees
have
been
deprived
of
their
rages
in
the
past,
the
effect
of
this
on
complying
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
competitors.
these
are
affirmative
standards.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
interest
of
the
public
in
--
in
inducing
enforcement
of
the
act.
we
find
--
we
find
that
there's
much
more
likelihood
of
much
greater
litigation
in
areas
where
the
courts
will
not
grant
injunctions.
in
this
region,
for
example,
there's
much
more
litigation
because
the
employee
feels
what
about
to
loose.
i'll
go
litigate
and
meanwhile
i'm
not
complying
and
i'm
not
even
going
to
have
an
injunction
issued
against
it.
ms.
bessie
margolin
so
it
encourages
--
it
encourages
contest
and
--
we
think
on
--
on
tenuous
grounds.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
start
thought
with
--
i
think
that
the
statute
says
the
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
for
cause
shown.
i
say
that
for
cause
shown,
you
showed
cause
when
you've
shown
that
they
have
covered
and
they're
violated.
and
that
in
--
in
the
absence
of
special
reasons
for
not
granting
the
injunction
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
that
it
should
be
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
that
is
should
be
granted.
ms.
bessie
margolin
limited
to
this
completed
project.
ms.
bessie
margolin
to
--
no,
just
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
this
one
project
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
these
employees.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
they
conceive
that
they
have
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
conceive
that
about
90
--
over
90%
of
their
projects
have
been
subject
to
the
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no
contest.
they
have
--
we
have
found
violations
occasionally
on
some
of
them
and
sometimes
they
made
restitutions,
sometimes
they
haven't.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
this
is
of
course
a
--
this
was
a
two
or
three-year
project
of
$6.5
million
so
it's
--
it's
a
big
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
piece
of
business.
ms.
bessie
margolin
but
not
--
but
not
--
but
it
has
no
effect.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
has
no
effect.
ms.
bessie
margolin
we
would
say
that
the
--
to
enjoin
them
from
--
from
doing
this
again
on
another
project
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
a
similar
--
at
least,
a
similar
project
or
on
other
projects
which
are
--
which
are
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
and
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
which,
i
think,
established
coverage
pretty
clearly.
now,
there
maybe
some
cases
where
you
be
--
have
perplexing
situations.
but
i
--
i
think
as
this
court
said
in
an
employee
suit
where
a
question
of
liquidated
damages
was
concerned.
ms.
bessie
margolin
if
that's
--
if
that's
perplexing
--
if
--
if
that
is
perplexing,
there
should
be
no
reason
why
that
burden
shouldn't
be
put
an
employer
who
is
--
shown
some
tendency
to
--
to
resolve
doubts
in
its
favor
and
it's
in
the
(inaudible).
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
burden
--
the
burden
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
burden
of
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
of
getting
right
as
to
whether
he's
covered
--
covered
or
not.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
but
i
say
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it
--
they
would
comply
--
they
--
they
would
pay
the
wages
as
required
by
the
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
that's
what
your
honors
stated
in
the
lublin
dissent
but
i
think
you
may
have
been
misunderstood
what
happens.
we
have
extremely
few
contempt
actions
under
this
act.
and
very
few
could
count
on
one
hand,
i
think,
the
criminal
contempt.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
but
you
should
obey
specific
requirements
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
of
the
law.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
our
injunctions
usually
specifically
provide
that
you
shall
pay
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
as
required
by
the
law.
it's
spelled
out
to
employees
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
or
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
some
of
them
specified
the
particular
types
of
activities.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
mentioned
the
specific
sections
which
have
been
violated
in
the
past.
it's
limited
to
those.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
i
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
that
certainly
in
--
in
some
cases,
there
is
some
further
explicit
specification
of
the
types
of
work
that
you're
enjoining
violation.
but
the
fact
remains
that
if
it's
not
within
the
coverage
of
the
act,
they're
not
violating
the
injunction.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
it
is
under
this
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
how
would
--
how
would
they
ever
be
--
how
would
they
ever
be
required
to
--
they
--
if
--
if
they
don't
believe
they
covered,
always,
they
do
is
they
don't
--
they
don't
pay,
and
we
have
to
come
in
and
ask
for
civil
contempt
if
it's
not.
if
it's
willful,
that's
where
the
coverage
is
clear.
and
that's
the
only
kind
of
case
where
you
can
get
any
criminal
contempt.
but
if
--
if
they
doubt
that
they're
covered
by
the
act,
they
don't
have
to
pay
their
employees.
they
can
--
they
can
sit
back
and
wait
until
we
come
to
court
and
say,
“we
think
they've
violated
the
injunction,”
or
they
can
go
in
the
court
and
asked
the
court
can
--
they
can
go
in
and
say
“the
government
tells
us
that
this
project
is
covered,
we'd
like
you
to
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
construe.”
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
to
construe
your
--
your
injunction.
does
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
does
your
injunction
intended
to
cover
this
project?
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
that's
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
--
well,
civil
contempt
just
ordering
them
to
pay
the
wages
due.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
inherent
in
this
act.
the
coverage
isn't
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
isn't
that
clear.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
you
could
get
such
a
particular
injunction
and
i
refer
the
court
to
the
jacksonville
paper
which
involved
a
contempt
action.
that
you
can't
get
it
so
particular
that
it
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
distinguish
a
--
every
other
particular
case
from
it.
ms.
bessie
margolin
so
you
have
to
have
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
but
this
is
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
a
very
restricted
statute.
this
covers
simply
payment
of
wages
and
--
and
overtime
compensation
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
coverage
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
that
--
i
didn't
--
certainly
didn't
mean
to
say
that
i
thought
that
was
simple.
and
--
and
many
cases,
obviously,
it
isn't.
but
i
think
that's
a
reason
why
you
can't
restrict
these
injunctions
to
just
particular
kinds
of
activities.
it's
too
easy
to
change
the
nature
of
the
employee's
activities.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
then
you
say,
well,
that's
not
covered
by
the
injunction.
you
make
a
slight
change
in
his
--
his
overtime
contract.
or
you
--
or
you
make
a
change
in
his
duties
and
try
to
come
within
one
of
the
exemptions.
now,
i
think
our
injunctions
are
to
protect
this
against
that
sort
of
--
of
thing.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i'll
say
this
that
this
case
certainly,
i'll
leave
you
with
this,
that
it's
so
narrow
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
that
--
it's
--
it's
nothing.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
--
i
say
it's
inherent
in
the
situation
that
these
cases
have
to
be
decided
case
by
case
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
that
it's
difficult
to
have
--
to
draft
a
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
a
--
a
limited
injunction
that
has
any
effect.
but
i
also
say
that
i
don't
think
this
imposes
any
burden
on
the
employer
because
he's
never
compelled
to
do
anything
on
the
injunction
until
it
is
decided
that
the
work
is
covered.
and
that
to
--
to
have
him
carry
some
of
the
burden
of
the
doubt,
if
he
guess
he's
wrong,
i
don't
think
it
should
be
ruled
out.
ms.
bessie
margolin
there
--
there
was
an
injunction.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
limited
to
this
particular
employees
engaged
on
this
particular
project.
ms.
bessie
margolin
in
the
court
of
appeals?
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
i
think
that
it
probably
should
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
we
weren't.
but
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
we
think
we
ought
to
--
probably
ought
to
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
determine
whether
the
--
whether
the
district
court
exceeded
it.
ms.
bessie
margolin
there,
the
court
of
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
know.
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
i
might
say
this
in
behalf
--
i
might
say
this
in
behalf
of
my
own
fifth
circuit,
as
i
think,
that
they're
all
coming
a
little
round
to
realize
that
what
we've
been
trying
to
tell
them
all
these
years
requires
some
aid
on
their
part.
and
they
have
been
in
the
last
two
or
three
cases,
i
think,
saying,
well,
maybe
we've
--
we've
gone
too
far
in
saying
the
good
faith
reliance
on
advice
of
counsel
on
good
faith,
feeling
that
you're
not
covered
is
not
--
is
ground
enough
for
denying
an
injunction.
and
they
have
reversed
two
or
three
limited
denials
of
injunction.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
also
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
with
--
with
some
general
guidance
from
this
court
would
--
would
remedy
the
problem
or
do
much
remedy.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
we
have.
we
filed
quite
a
number
of
them
but
they
can
only
be
filed
on
the
request
of
the
employees.
ms.
bessie
margolin
very
few
of
those
now.
they
--
i
think
that
--
that
disapproved
around
a
fruitless
remedy
because
--
well,
the
portal
act
this
--
had
some
--
caused
some
trouble
with
that.
they
discouraged
the
attorneys
from
--
from
taking
those
cases
because
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
some
of
them
one
in
the
supreme
court
and
then
had
congress
reverse
them.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
said
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
discouraged
attorneys
from
taking
those
cases.
ms.
bessie
margolin
of
the
employee
suits.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
fact
that
the
fees
are
too
--
or
very
low
and
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
they're
not
fixed
by
the
act.
the
--
the
act
provides
that
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
should
be
awarded.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
the
amounts
are
small,
you
see,
the
amounts
are
small
and
the
question
--
the
questions
maybe
very
long
drawn
out.
also
a
lot
of
these
cases
have
to
be
tried
to
a
jury
so
that
it
become
--
and
this
act
is
kind
of
complicated
and
it
gets
to
the
jury
and
the
employee
frequently
is
not
able
to
prove
coverage.
and
they'll
all
sorts
of
burdens
on
that
remedy.
and
--
and
since
the
portal
act,
particularly,
i
think
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
is
what?
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
that
they
don't
get
a
quick
understanding
of
these
coverage
questions
and
exemptions.
there
are
so
many
coverage
and
exemption
questions
that
i
think
that
these
cases
get
quite
confused
when
they
go
to
the
jury.
this
is
one
of
the
difficulties
they
find
in
two
in
the
16
(c)
remedy
where
the
administrators
requested
to
sue
on
behalf
of
the
employee.
they
have
to
be
--
they
tried
before
a
jury
too.
and
it's
extremely
difficult
even
though
there
suppose
to
be
no
unsettled
question
of
law
in
those
cases,
and
i
supposed
to
bring
them
unless
no
unsettled
question
of
law.
just
talking
to
--
just
having
the
court
charged
the
jury
and
having
the
employers
counsel
talk
to
the
jury
about
the
coverage
and
exemption
questions
here
involved
confuses
them.
and
it's
--
it's
also
very
long
drawn
out
in
expensive
process.
in
fact,
one
of
the
judges
had
just
told
us
in
alabama
that
these
cases
involved
so
little
money
and
this
is
so
burdensome
to
try.
he
was
going
to
refer
them
all
to
a
master.
he
didn't
want
to
bother
with
it.
ms.
bessie
margolin
now
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
was
the
judge's
attitude,
and
i
must
say
when
--
with
over
crowded
courts
on
it,
i'm
sympathetic
with
it
[laughs]
because
they
involved
--
each
individual
case
involves
relatively
small
amount.
this
is
why
we
feel
that
the
injunction
remedy
is
so
important
because
then
you
can
establish
a
basis
for
getting
recovery
for
all
employees,
complains
for
all
employees
in
--
in
one
action.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
to
the
injunction
remedy,
i
think
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
do
we
what?
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
but
it
has
to
be
at
the
request
of
the
employees.
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
and
--
and
only
--
usually
only
a
few
of
them
were
willing
to
request
it,
ex-employees
mostly.
if
they're
still
working
for
the
employer,
they're
--
are
not
very
likely
to
want
to
antagonize
him.
ms.
bessie
margolin
your
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
this
is
in
wholly
under
public
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
enforcement
basis.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
we've
had
two
litigations
and
this
has
been
a
very
long
drawn
outline
here.
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
is
the
second.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
is
the
second.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
the
--
that's
our
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
general
prayer
for
relief.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
wouldn't
deny
anybody
a
right
to
litigate.
and
certainly,
they
--
they're
freely
been
litigating.
i
don't
think
what
i'm
asking
denies
them
any
right
whatsoever
to
litigate
any
question
of
coverage
even
if
it's
been
pretty
easily
settled
if
they
think
they
have
a
basis
for
thinking
it
might
be
changed.
what
i
say
is
that
they
--
they
can
litigate
after
the
injunction
is
issued
to
the
heart's
content.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
if
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
because
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
the
injunction
does
this,
and
this
is
--
if
--
if
they
weren't
--
if
an
injunction
had
been
issued
here,
for
example,
preliminary
injunction
when
we
ask
for
it.
the
trial
court
said,
“well,
i
don't
think
i
need
to
issue
a
preliminary
injunction
because
the
respondent
here
is
--
is
perfectly
solvent,
and
he'll
be
able
to
pay
and
respondent
was
all
giving
that
his
employees
might
take
the
money
and
he's
never
be
able
to
get
it
back
if
it
will
later
determined
he
was
covered.”
well,
the
court
didn't
issue
the
injunction
although,
he
could've
--
he
could've
required
--
the
district
court
didn't
issue
preliminary
injunction
although
he
could've
required
them
to
put
up
a
bond
or
something
in
the
event
that
they
were
ultimately
held
entitled
to
have
money
and
because
it
was
admitted
that
some
$50,000
would
be
due
if
they
were
covered.
respondent
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
continued
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
can
i
just
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
tell
you
what
happened
here?
ms.
bessie
margolin
[laughter]
i
appreciate
that,
justice
--
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i've
never
thought
it
was.
but
the
--
what
happened
here
was
that
the
court
said,
“i'm
convinced
on
this
preliminary
injunction
that
you're
covered
by
this
act.”
and
with
--
even
with
that,
although
respondent
said
that
it
was
relying
on
advice
of
counsel
that
it
wasn't
covered,
but
the
judge
told
him
at
that
time,
“i
think
you've
covered.
i'm
convinced
i
don't
see
what
other
evidence
you
could
bring
in
that
would
change
my
mind.”
but
respondent
still
went
on
--
went
on
with
his
noncompliance.
he
wasn't
willing
to
accept
the
judge's
tentative
view.
he
preferred
to
accept
his
own
doubts
or
his
counsel's
advice,
and
he
went
on
and
didn't
went
on
with
his
noncompliance
in
those
circumstances.
and
when
the
final
order
came
down,
the
judge
was
in
no
position
to
--
to
make
him
pay
employees
even
for
the
period
after
he
had
decided
that
there
was
coverage.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
as
--
can
--
can
i
just
put
this
question
to
you.
is
it
right
or
fair
that
employees
should
not
be
paid
what
--
their
rights
on
this?
now,
this
act
is
20
years
old
now,
that
the
employees
should
loose
their
wages
under
this
act
every
time
there's
a
doubt
as
to
coverage
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
even
though
they're
ultimate
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
you
think
that
this
law
was
intended
to
put
them
on
an
equal
basis?
ms.
bessie
margolin
as
to
minimum
wages?
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
in
government
--
certainly
congress
intended
the
government
to
throw
its
weight
on
the
side
of
the
--
of
the
minimum
--
the
substandard
wage
earners
in
this
country
when
it
passed
this
law,
i
think
that
is
certainly
clear
beyond
doubt,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
