you
found
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
can
tell
you
what
the
difference
will
be.
i
have
too
much
experience
with
this.
you
then
live
under
a
penalty
of
citations
for
contempt
whereas
your
competition
lives
under
the
law
of
the
land,
isn't
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they're
not
(voice

--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
need
their
consent,
ms.
margolin,
to
file
an
injunction
action
under
--
under
17
(c)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
need
the
consent
of
employees
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
file
this
injunction
action?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
i
understand
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
in
this
case,
this
respondent
has
had
one
former
piece
of
litigation
involving
the
wage
or
the
law.
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
say
there
comes
a
time
when
the
courts
must
come
to
the
aid
of
the
government,
isn't
not?
and
that
that
time
is
here
with
respect
to
this
respondent
who
has
had
one
piece
of
litigation
involving
this
act
and
you
asked
therefore
an
injunction
against
this
respondent
from
“violating
the
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act”,
isn't
that
what
you
ask?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
is
the
second,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
the
second?
just
answer
my
question,
please.
isn't
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
the
second
one?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
this
--
does
that
--
that's
the
relief
you
asked
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now,
then
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then,
since
when
has
not
a
citizen
as
well
as
the
government
the
right
to
have
with
his
rights
litigated
within
the
courts
of
the
land?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
what
good
is
the
injunction
to
you?
you
want
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
the
injunction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
hope
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
let
me
just
make
this
statement
to
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice

--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
is
not
pretending.
i
--
i
realized
the
position
you're
in.
i
just
don't
agree
with
it.
it's
all
but
it's
not
first.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i've
had
(voice

in
this
view,
citations
issued
against
clients
of
mine,
there
are
number
of
cases
by
your
department
under
just
this
kind
of
a
business.
and
i
tell
you
it's
not
fair,
it's
not
right
to
deny
once
that
has
any
right
to
live
under
the
law
of
the
land
since
(inaudible)
it
had
one
piece
of
litigation
with
the
government
and
then
its
competitors
or
make
him
live
under
citation
of
contempt
and
his
competitors
live
on
the
law
of
land.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
at
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
goes
to
open
to
them
just
like
they
argued
the
employers
but
the
weight
of
the
government
shouldn't
be
told
either
way.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
more
ones
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
but
--
but
not
(inaudible)
the
government
loose
its
weight
to
one
side.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
sir,
is
that
--
can
be
found
in
the
secretary's
own
construction
and
his
own
regulation?
