are
you
suggesting
that
the
injunction
must
issue
automatically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
--
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we've
jumped
at
--
at
this
stage
of
your
argument,
we
assume,
that
all
those
substantive
question
are
out
of
the
way
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
remedies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
to
my
question
was
not
automatic
but
they
should
consider
the
public
--
public
report
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
incident.
well,
that's
no
different
than
in
the
case
of
other
injunctions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that?
you
said
this
is
different
from
other
injunctions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
mean
--
what
the
court
--
does
it
mean
or
do
you
imply
that
the
court
have
said
doubtfully
although
they
may
decide
for
you?
maybe
to
them
--
for
them
a
doubtful
or
arguable
question
where
they
come
down
on
your
side
of
the
fence
and
that
being
so,
if
they
still
come
here
and
therefore
they
move
enjoined,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
they
be
doing
if
they
decide
for
you
substantively
then
the
question
of
remedy
and
they
say,
“what
are
the
reasons
why
they
wouldn't
give
an
injunction?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
still
decide
for
you
although
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
is
it
that
they
say
that
they
can
come
up
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
--
and
show
them
wrong?
justice

i
don't
understand
what
they
--
justice

it
would
have
bear
any
hope,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
if
--
if
it's
clear
that
they
are
--
it
comes
within
the
act
and
they
don't
need
an
injunction
on
the
theory
that
they
will

what
has
been
the
experience
of
the

regarding
the
obedience
of
employers
who
do

taken
a

who
do
not
seek
to
get
review
here,
stop
with
the

of
appeals.
and
after
having
the
case
decided
against
them,
they
say
“very
well,
your
honors,
now,
we'll
obey,”
what
is
the
experience
of
the
department?

for

order,
would
you,

they
--
if

justice

if
it's
an
arguable
question,
you
wouldn't.
justice

i
would
have
been
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
construction
of
the
injunction
practically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
put
in
a
single
word.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
government
is
arguing
that
when
it
comes
to
relief
by
way
of
injunction,
in
these
fair
labor
standards
case,
you
would
deny,
you
would
say,
“no,
it
isn't
--
it
is
no
--
it
does
not
permit
to
have
a
case,
that
an
injunction
after
all
is
an
extraordinary
remedy.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
maybe
i
don't,
if
you
let
me
say
so,
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
answer
my
question
that
if
the
substantive
claim
of
the
government
was
staged,
then
an
injunction
should
follow
as
a
matter,
of
course,
calling
for
obedience.
why
don't
you
give
that
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
have
a
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
indicate
the
kind
of
discretions
that
--
that
legitimately
may
govern
a
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
substantive
issue.
that's
on
the
subsequent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
particular
case.
but
i
might
to
infer,
as
i
do
infer
as
you
correctly
--
that
with
rare
exception
or
under
whole
is
the
--
it's
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
that
if
a
court,
the
district
court
finally
rules,
clearly
rules
that
a
--
that
conduct
comes
within
all
transactions
and
here
comfort
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
that
the
--
and
that
the
parties
say
if
not
the
ruling
of
the
court,
we
should
obey
that
on
the
hold
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
is
not
a
respect
for
that
undertaking?
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
--
the
reason
i
ask
what
is
in
my
mind
is
i've
noticed
the
great
interest
that
the
english
court
which
now
has
something
comparable
to
our
sherman
law
restrictive
practice
of
that,
after
they
had
find
that
the
behavior
of
the
association
usually
these
are
collective
price
rates
and
so
on.
when
the
court
ruled
that
it
is
against
the
statute,
they
invariably
say,
we
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
issue
an
injunction
because
the
parties
will
now
avail.
and
i
should
just
like
to
think
that
american
employers
having
decided
cases
against
him
unequally
law
abiding
as
the
english
(voice

--
justice
felix

i'm
not
saying
they
are.
i
just
want
to
know.
justice

all
right.

this
--
this

has
held

held
that
you

than

should
obey

i'm
not
--
i'm
not

justice

what
i
want
to
know
is
what

what
would

referred.

justice

but
you
know
--
justice

--
even
better
than
i
do
that
these

nice
distinctions
are
being
made
in
this
field.
and
if
you
just
say,
you
should
obey
the
law,
you
should
pay
them
these,
these

amounts

they're
engaged
in

justice

had

that

--
prayer
or
a
judgment?
justice

even
--
justice

i
shouldn't
think
that
it's
a
desirable
thing
to
issue
an

and
say
the
relief
of
whether
you're
within
this
or
not

to
come
in

as
to
have
you
hail
them

you

all

justice

all
depends
the

i
don't
--
justice

that's
what
they
used
to
say
(inaudible)
--
justice

injunction
from
labor
cases,
and
i
used
to
think
that
was
a
great
evil
to
have
such
dubious
provision
in
a
labor
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
ms.
margolin,
as
to
whether
you're
within
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
coverage
of
this
act
is
not
a
simple
thing.
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
otherwise,
you
wouldn't
be
here
so
often.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
order
to
protects
this

an
injunction

would
protect
two
interest,
one,
you
ought
not
to

the
injunction
ought
not
to
be
so
that
--
that
it
can
be
invaded
or
avoided
whatever
word
you
plea
by
a
difference
that
isn't
a
difference,
by
a
differentiation
that
isn't
a
difference.
on
the
other
hand,
it
shouldn't
be
fair
scope
for
--
for
such
doubts
that
the
only
answer
is
to
hit
him
up
for
contempt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
wanted
from
you,
the
answer
as
to
whether
you
think
an
injunction
is
automatic.
you
said
no
to
that.
you've
indicated
however
that
it
would
be
so
weighted
that
on
the
whole,
you
an
injunction
because
of
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter
that
if
violation
is
found,
then
an
injunction
if
issued,
except
--
except
to
circumstances.
that's
your
view.
and
there's
the
next
question
as
to
the
writ
of
the
injunction
not
with
such
particularity
that
can
easily
escape
from
it
but
also
not
with
so
much
room
that
it
needs
a
fair
measure
of
doubt
in
view
of
the
difficulties
of
having
in
court
case
by
case
beside
this
premise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
the
decree
in
this
case,
where
was
the
--
the
original?
there
was
an
injunction,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
--
why
don't
we
turn,
ms.
margolin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
you
--
you
think
that
it
(inaudible)
in
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
that
had
been
passed
to
the
district
court
but
the
court
also
indicate
that
the
injunction
should
be
broaden.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
you
satisfied
with
the
district
court's
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
afraid
we'd
have
to
get
very
particular
structures
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice

frankfurter
--
in
case
like
this
is
covered
not
only
that
the
injunction
was
all
right
but
they
should
make
it
broader.
i
think
we'd
have
to
be
very
specific
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
almost
draw
the
injunction
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
--
justice

--
think
is
it's
not
the
law
but
the
judgement
should
be
amended?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i,
without
breaking
the
architecture
of
your
argument,
ask
you
this
question.
would
the
employee
who
actually
delivered
the
--
the
drivers
on
the
truck,
that's
the
way
it's
done
and
i'm
going
to
disclose
a
big
deal
of
ignorance
my
question
on
that
phase.
would
the
drivers
of
a
truck
that
brings
water
out
of
this
reservoir
or
dam
to
the
industry
in
question,
would
they,
in
your
opinion,
be
under
the
act?
justice

i'm
not
saying
that
therefore
yours,
i
just
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pre-crawl
towards
this
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
was
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
--
you
--
you
have
doubts
about
that.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
think
that
is
the
case
before
us
but
i
just
wondered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
say
that
i'm
--
i'm
most
sympathetic
to
anybody
who
finds
it
difficult
to
draw
a
line.
i
don't
think
you
can
jump
from
one
thing
to
another,
nice
distinctions
have
to
be
made,
and
congress
vested
the
trust
of
making
those
distinctions
in
courts
instead
of
an
administrative
agency.
but
i
want
to
be
--
to
care
to
differentiate
the
relation,
the
word
“nexus”,
i
think
has
been
used
in
this
case,
of
the
relation,
the
tie-in
between
my
--
tank
trucks
or
truck
drivers
and
the
window
washer
and
--
and
the
kirschbaum
case.

the
window
cleaner.
