ms.

chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
broad
did
the
government
ask
the
injunction
to
be?
chief

we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
ms.
margolin.
mr.
moorhead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
on
the
fact
that
this
dam
is
some
miles
away
from
the
--
from
a
situs
of
these
industries
would
make
no
difference,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
that
--
would
that
apply
to
any
public
utility?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
percentage
of
this
water
is
used
by
the
industries?
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
moorhead,
suppose
the
court
should
decide
against
you
on
the
question
of
coverage,
what
--
what
your
opinion
should
be
the
disposition
of
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
my
--
the
only
reason
i
asked
that
question
is
because
the
--
you
--
you
raised
the
question
on
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
should
we
--
should
we
follow
the
--
the
procedure
that
ms.
margolin
suggested
of
sending
it
back
to
the
--
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
determination
of
--
of
whether
the
action
was
appropriate
or
--
or
do
you
ask
us
here
to
--
to
make
a
decision
that
it
was
or
was
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
moorehead.
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
earl
warren

well
mr.
johnson,
thank
you.
that
would
be
all.
