mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
colloquy
which
has
just
ensued
the
temptation
is
strong
to
again
discussing
immediately
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
injunction
in
this
case.
however,
mr.
johnson
and
i
have
reached
a
draft
apportionment
whereby
subject
to
questions
of
the
court.
i
was
to
discuss
primarily
the
question
of
coverage
which,
of
course,
is
the
fair
amount
question
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
and
again,
subject
to
the
questions
of
the
court,
he
proposes
to
deal
with
the
injunctive
feature.
so
i
will
mention
at
the
beginning,
the
question
of
coverage
in
this
case
which
we
feel
is
a
most
serious
one
and
certainly
is,
by
no
means,
as
clear
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
indicated
that
she
believes
it
is.
now,
we
start
and
we've
tried
to
start
throughout
this
litigation
with
the
proposition
as
this
court
has
several
times
stated
that
in
a
coverage
case
of
this
kind,
the
problem
that
faces
all
of
us,
that
faces
the
court
in
rendering
its
decisions,
that
faces
those
of
us
in
private
practice
in
advising
our
clients,
our
--
our
joint
problem,
our
mutual
problem
is
to
try
to
decide
where
to
draw
the
line
in
these
coverage
cases.
and
this
court,
of
course,
has
observed
in
the
past
that
looking
for
a
dependable
touchstone
as
a
guide
in
attempting
to
draw
that
line
is,
as
i
think
the
court
put
it,
about
as
rewarding
as
attempting
to
square
the
circle.
we
have
no
quick
answer.
we
have
no
easy
answer
to
urge
upon
the
court
as
far
as
coverage
is
concerned
under
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
all
that
we
think
we
can
do
is
to
marshal
to
the
court,
as
we've
tried
to
do
in
our
briefs
and
as
i
shall
try
to
do
in
argument,
the
factors
which
we
think
will
assist
us
and
assist
the
court
in
drawing
the
line
of
coverage
in
this
case.
and
we
began,
of
course,
in
setting
both
--
for
those
factors
with
the
actual
facts
in
the
case.
we
have
a
dam
here
built
on
a
non-navigable
river
located
solely
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
texas.
the
dam
was
not
constructed
for
flood
control
purposes
unlike
other
dams
that
have
been
before
this
court
in
other
context.
it
was
not
constructed
to
aid
navigation.
no
federal
funds
were
used
in
the
construction
of
the
dam.
the
dam
produces
no
hydroelectric
energy.
it's
merely
a
dam
on
the
nueces
river
approximately
42
miles
above
the
city
of
corpus
christi
which
was
built
by
the
respondent
here
in
the
h.
b.
zachry
company
pursuant
to
contract
between
it
and
the
lower
nueces
river
water
supply
district.
and
the
actual
outline
contractually
speaking
and
also
physically
speaking
of
the
facts
in
the
case
are
these.
zachry,
the
respondent
contracted
with
the
district
for
the
construction
of
the
dam
and
built
the
dam.
and
of
course
the
activities
of
his
employees
in
constructing
the
dam
are
what
are
before
this
court
for
review.
the
district
in
turn
and
the
district
is
no
coextensive
with
the
city
of
corpus
christi
and
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas,
the
district
is
an
entirely
different
animal
than
a
municipality
such
as
the
city
of
corpus
christi.
the
district
entered
into
a
contract
whereby
it
agreed
to
sell
to
the
city
the
water
impounded
by
the
dam.
and
as
far
as
the
flow
of
the
water
is
concerned,
once
my
client,
the
respondent
built
the
dam,
once
his
employees
left
the
scene,
water
began
to
be
impounded
and
is
still
being
impounded
behind
the
dam.
when
that
water
is
impounded,
it's
the
property
of
the
district.
but
the
district
has,
by
contract,
sold
it
to
the
city
of
corpus
christi.
and
as
water
is
released
through
this
dam,
it's
metered,
the
city
takes
title
there,
that
water
is
discharged
into
the
bed
of
the
nueces
river
where
it
flows
down
the
old
riverbed
26
miles
downstream
to
a
little
town
called
calallen.
and
the
city
of
corpus
christi
has
constructed
a
treatment
plant,
a
purification
plant
at
calallen.
the
water
goes
through
the
treatment
plant.
it
then
goes
downstream
another
16
miles
for
a
total
of
42
miles
where
it
enters
in
to
the
old
distribution
system,
water
distribution
system
of
the
city
of
corpus
christi.
and
once
it
enters
that
distribution
system
and
is
sold
and
distributed
by
the
--
the
city,
it
sold,
of
course,
to
the
usual
miscellany
of
customers
that
any
sizeable
city
sells
water
to.
and
among
those
customers
are
numerous
industries
in
the
city
of
corpus
christi
which
use
water
in
connection
with
the
production
of
goods
which
they
manufacture
for
commerce.
so,
we
have
a
question
here
whether
a
basic
question,
the
--
the
government
has
--
has
interjected
a
few
tangential
factors
but
basically,
this
lawsuit
begin
with
this
question,
and
i
think
it's
the
principle
question
now
before
the
court.
the
question
is
simply
this.
when
respondent's
employees
built
the
dam
up
the
nueces
river,
were
they,
in
some
way,
performing
some
kind
of
activity
which
was
tied
so
closely
to
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
by
the
manufacturing
plants
in
corpus
christi
as
to
make
it
possible
for
the
courts
to
say
that
the
workers
upon
that
dam
were,
in
fact,
connected
with
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
and
that
therefore,
coverage
should
obtain
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
i
--
you're
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
they
--
they
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
i
was
on
the
verge
of
saying
what
your
honor
and
the
remainder
of
the
court
knows
that
in
trying
to
decide
where
to
draw
the
line,
we
have
to
consider
the
relationship
and
the
essentiality
of
the
services.
and
certainly,
we
think
if
you
had
a
case
where
water
was
transported
by
tank
trucks
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
--
to
a
manufacturing
plant
and
--
and
put
in
to
a
cooling
tower
or
a
boiler
or
something
there,
certainly,
the
man
that
drove
up
to
the
plant
and
emptied
the
water
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
--
the
government
--
no.
i
do
not
think
it's
clear
that
coverage
would
obtain
but
i
say
that
the
government
would
have
a
far
better
case
there
than
we
have
in
our
case.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
i
--
i
have
doubts
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
if
it
be
true
as
counsel
for
the
government
argues
that
the
eighth
circuit
in
its
chambers
case
decision,
there
are
two
chambers
cases
as
the
court
may
know
and
we
--
we
will
be
talking
about
both
of
them.
the
one
by
the
eighth
circuit
is
the
one
which
is
the
strongest
or
the
stronger
of
the
two
against
us,
if
it
be
true
that
what
the
court
for
the
eighth
circuit
held
in
the
chambers
case
is
that
an
employee
who
works
on
the
actual
distribution
system
who's
part
and
parcel
of
parcelling
out
the
water
is
covered
by
the
act,
then
your
driver
in
your
case
would
--
would
be
--
would
be
covered
and
have
conceded.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
in
the
kirschbaum
case,
of
course,
your
honor,
was
dealing
with
maintenance
workers
including
window
washers,
as
i
recall,
who
worked
on
buildings
which
released
to
persons
engaged
in
the
actual
production
of
commerce.
probably,
i
would
say
that
as
a
matter
of
physical
causation
tie
in
between
what
a
man's
doing
and
the
furnished
goods
that
your
man
driving
the
tank
truck
is
closer
than
the
man.
he
is
certainly
more
directly
essential
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
--
i
say,
than
the
window
cleaner,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
we
are
mentioning
and
we
think
it
is
proper
to
mention
as
--
as
we
have
done
the
fact
that
as
a
matter
of
contract,
we
are
at
least
one
stage
further
removed
from
the
actual
production
then
it
would
be
true
if
the
employees
involved
were
the
employees
of
the
city
of
corpus
christi
who
built
the
dam.
i
think
we
would
be
on
very
thin
ice
if
we
have
to
appear
before
the
--
this
court
saying
that
that
fact
that
we
are
one
contract
farther
back
is
the
dividing
line
between
coverage
and
--
and
a
lack
of
average.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
that
is
correct.
yes.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
that,
my
answer,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
almost
exactly
the
answer
that
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
black.
we
don't
think
geography
is
the
solution
to
the
matter
in
the
–-
the
borden
company
versus
borella
which
this
court
decided
after
the
kirschbaum
case.
there
was
quite
a
distance
there
between
the
building
involved
and
the
physical
manufacture.
there
again,
if
--
if
we
had
to
rely
upon
that
42
miles,
we
--
we
would
have
a
slender
reed.
but
we
do
say
that
the
court
cannot
ignore
or
should
certainly,
can
it
--
it
perhaps
should
not
ignore
the
factors
of
distance
and
contractual
connection
in
considering
the
whole
of
the
picture
and
deciding
where
to
draw
the
line.
and
i
was
going
to
elude
and
i
might
just
make
brief
reference
to
it
now
to
the
fact
that
in
trying
to
find
touchstones,
in
trying
to
decide
where
to
draw
this
line,
the
labor
department
itself
has
named
a
series
of
factors
which
we
have
set
forth
at
two
places
in
our
brief
and
they're
also
contained
in
the
regulations
which
are
copied
verbatim
in
the
appendix.
they
have
set
--
set
forth
at
least
six
factors.
we
list
them
seriatim
on
page
58
of
our
brief.
and
the
very
first
of
those
factors
that
the
labor
department
itself
lists
is
where
--
where,
when
and
how
the
activity
in
question
is
performed
in
relation
to
the
production
to
which
it
relates.
we
think
the
42
miles
is
at
least
pertinent
to
the
where,
the
when
enters
into
in
the
sense
certainly
that
our
employees
perform
their
activities
months
ago
from
the
standpoint
of
time.
their
--
their
labors
have
in
effect
upon
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
today
only
and
whenever
a
man
in
one
of
these
factories
who
was
over
to
take
a
drink
of
water
or
put
water
in
a
boiler
or
a
cooling
tower.
how
the
activity
is
performed?
well,
of
course,
we
have
a
totally
different
activity
performed
here,
the
building
of
the
dam
being
utterly
dissimilar
to
the
manufacturing
of
selling
these
or
the
other
products
that
are
manufactured
in
the
city
of
corpus
christi.
they
go
on
down
the
line.
the
labor
department
doesn't
say
and
we
don't
say
that
the
answers
to
when,
where
and
how
determine
this,
but
--
but
they
have
to
be
considered.
the
labor
department
then
says
another
factor
to
consider
is
whether
the
activity
is
performed
within
or
without
the
productive
enterprise.
well,
certainly,
the
answer
to
that
consideration
is
in
our
favor
because
here,
the
building
of
the
dam
was
utterly
outside
the
various
productive
enterprises
that
you
find
in
the
city
of
corpus
christi.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
i
--
i
think
my
answer
would
have
to
be
yes,
any
public
utility
such
as
we
know
in
a
--
a
city
of
any
size,
yes.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
and
i
think
the
answer
to
the
next
factor
here,
the
third
factor
where
the
labor
department
says
consideration
should
be
held
of
whether
its
performance
is
with
the
primary
view
of
aiding
production
or
is
for
some
other
purpose.
we
say
there
that
we
were
interested
as
the
trial
court
recognized
not
in
aiding
this
handful
of
industries
down
on
the
waterfront.
we
were
interested
rather
in
aiding
the
whole
of
the
corpus
christi
area,
the
residential
consumers,
the
schools,
the
other
customers
as
well
as
the
industrial
ones.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
and
yet,
that
--
that
answer
too
would
apply
equally
to
all
public
utilities.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
volume
was
the
--
the
original
records
of
the
water
department
are
in
evidence
and
are
before
this
court
in
original
form
with
40%
approximate
of
ms.
margolin.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
the
--
the
government's
estimation
is
40%
to
50%
and
we
could
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
that
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
that,
your
honor,
is
--
is
a
point
that
i
certainly
was
going
to
make
in
a
--
a
large
variety
of
cases,
public
utilities
cases,
it's
--
it's
your
electric
energy
itself,
that
is
a
--
a
--
if
you
can
call
electric
energy,
a
good
or
a
product
that
moves
in
commerce.
and
that's
certainly
true
of
--
of
gas
at
least
in
--
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
now,
i
--
i'm
glad,
your
honor,
that
you
mentioned
that
because
that
--
and
i
mean
no
criticism,
i'm
trying
to
be
factual
when
i
say
this,
that
is
an
11th
hour
argument.it
is
one
that
we
did
not
hear
in
the
district
court.
the
only
support
the
government
confined
for
that
argument
that
that
our
workers
were
really
producing
water
and
that
the
water
itself
was
the
good
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
a
bunch
of
string
citations
which
it
gave
on
--
on
an
elementary
proposition,
the
trial
court
cited
this
court's
decision
in
the
alstate
case.
if
it
be
true
that
our
people
in
building
the
dam
were
producing
water,
and
i
might
add
that
that
kind
that
the
government
has
said
at
great
length
in
its
both
brief
that
this
case
should,
pursuant
to
the
admonition
of
this
court
in
vollmer,
be
decided
upon
practical
considerations
rather
than
technical
conceptions.
if
we
use
those
tests
and
if
we
assume
that
it
is
practical
to
say
that
in
building
a
dam,
we
are
producing
water.
i
don't
see
where
--
where
that
argument
avails
the
government
in
this
case.
they,
themselves,
admit
that
they
made
no
attempt
to
develop
any
theory
that
the
water
so
produced
if
such
it
is
becomes
an
ingredient
in
--
in
any
good
that
is
produced
for
commerce.
and
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
only
portion
of
the
record
on
that
point
which
is
set
forth
verbatim
in
our
brief
in
a
footnote
on
page
44,
the
only
evidence
on
the
point
was
that
nobody
knew
of
any
case
where
water
becomes
an
ingredient
in
any
product.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
government,
they
even
interjected
a
helpful
quip
there
to
the
effect
that
he
didn't
know
of
any
at
least
in
the
case
of
petroleum
products.
i
don't
see
where
--
where
the
--
the
theory
that
by
building
the
dam,
we
produce
water
and
that
the
water
is
the
particular
goods
in
this
case
can't
avail
the
government
at
all.
and
certainly,
the
case
has
been
tried
and
argued
and
the
brief
below
almost
99%
and
4400%
upon
the
theory
that
the
goods
involved
are
not
the
dam,
of
course,
because
the
dam
can't
be
a
good,
but
rather
are
the
products
of
the
industrial
plants
in
the
corpus
christi
area,
and
the
question
has
been,
what's
your
relationship
between
the
route
picker
out
here
who's
working
on
the
dam
and
selling
this
becomes
out
of
--
for
a
factory
of
corpus
christi.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
no,
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
the
only
new
law
that
might
be
involved
in
this
case
in
any
sensitive
word
would
be
that
the
case,
i
believe,
affords
this
court
its
first
square
opportunity
to
write
upon
the
possible
effect
and
we
think
very
significant
effect
of
the
1949
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
changed
at
least
in
wording
and
we
think
insignificant
tenure,
the
tests
to
be
used
in
--
in
drawing
the
line.
and
i
--
i
was
about
to
--
to
come
to
that
because
i
think
it
is
highly
important
because
it
is
practically
the
only
new
law
within
this
case.
now,
a
question
was
asked
counsel
for
the
government
as
to
what
case
she
relied
upon
strongest
in
support
of
her
position
on
coverage.
and
i
believe
she
gave
the
--
the
court
a
large
number
of
samples
to
choose
from.
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
saying
that
as
far
as
logic
and
rationale
are
concerned,
we
rely
strongest
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
callus
case
which
was
another
one
of
the
building
cases
following
upon
the
hills
of
--
of
kirschbaum
and
borella.
and
we
think
the
--
the
callus
case
ties
directly
in
to
what
was
accomplished
by
the
1949
amendments.
and
since
i
haven't
mentioned
those
amendments
yet,
i'd
like
to
get
to
them
now.
as
the
court
notes,
prior
to
1949,
in
the
case
involving
goods
--
production
of
goods
for
commerce
where
the
activity
in
question
was,
as
we
think
is
true
in
this
case,
not
an
activity
involving
actual
production
but
rather
if
it
was
anything
at
all
was
an
activity
in
a
closely
--
in
a
related
process
or
occupation.
where
that
type
of
situation
was
before
the
courts
prior
to
1949,
the
portion
of
the
act
which
governed
that
situation
said
that
the
activity
was
covered
if
it
was
in
a
related
process
or
occupation
necessary
to
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
and
of
course,
under
the
necessary
test,
although
this
court
said
that
not
everything
that
was
indispensable
was
necessary,
certainly,
under
the
necessary
language,
there
were
reasons
for
extending
the
bounds
of
coverage
quite
broadly.
i
believe
one
of
the
judges
some
years
ago
complained
saying
that
the
extensions
were
getting
to
the
point
where
under
the
necessary
tests,
it
was
like
tossing
a
pebble
into
a
pond,
and
then
because
of
the
infinite
ripples
that
went
out
saying
that
--
that
everything
that
occurred
beyond
the
point
of
impact
was
in
--
in
some
way
caused
by
the
pebble.
it's
certainly
under
the
necessary
language,
there
was
a
basis
for
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
saying
that
coverage
was
quite
broad
in
these
related
occupation
or
process
cases.
however,
in
1949,
congress
by
deliberate
act
inserted
the
word
"closely"
before
the
words
"related
process
or
occupation"
and
deleted
the
word
“necessary”
and
substituted
therefore
the
words
“directly
essential”.
with
the
result
since
1949,
that
portion
of
the
statute
has
provided
that
coverage
obtains
only
where
the
activity
in
question
is
in
a
closely
related
process
or
occupation
directly
essential
to
the
physical
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
the
callus
case
was
decided
under
the
old
necessary
case.
and
yet,
we
think
we've
learned
much
from
the
language
of
the
callus
case
even
--
even
under
the
old
test.
and
certainly,
the
--
the
logic
there
employed
we
think
becomes
even
more
pertinent
under
the
1949
amendments.
in
the
callus
case,
for
example,
this
court
said
that
remoteness
of
a
particular
activity
from
the
physical
process
of
manufacturing
while
not
decisive
of
the
question
is
certainly
a
relevant
factor
to
aid
in
drawing
the
line.
and
if
remoteness
was
a
relevant
factor
even
under
the
necessary
test,
we
think
it's
even
more
a
--
a
relevant
factor
under
the
closely
related
and
directly
essential
test.
now,
the
government
has
argued
both
in
brief
and
here
today
that
actually,
the
1949
amendments
with
this
change
in
language
were
of
but
little
effect.
the
department
of
labor
has
not
said
so
in
its
own
regulations
on
the
contrary.
in
the
regulation
which
we've
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
page
79
of
our
brief
and
at
the
top
of
page
80,
the
labor
department
itself
has
said
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
new
language,
and
i'm
quoting
here,
“in
the
final
clause
of
section
3
(j)
of
the
act
is
intended
to
narrow
and
to
provide
a
more
precise
guide
to
the
scope
of
its
coverage
in
exactly
the
type
of
case
that
we
have
here
at
the
bar."
the
fifth
circuit,
i
mean
the
fifth
circuit
of
course
in
our
case
has
so
construed
the
--
the
1949
amendments,
but
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
construed
these
amendments
as
having
a
limited
effect,
the
sixth
circuit
has
so
construed
them
in
mitchell
versus
moore,
which
we
have
cited
and
--
and
discussed
in
our
brief,
and
the
1949
amendments
have
been
given
such
a
construction
also
by
the
seventh
and
the
tenth
circuits
in
two
additional
cases
which
we
referred
to
as
the
hospital
cases
in
their
briefs.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
as
i
read,
your
honor,
the
secretary's
own
construction
and
his
own
regulation
at
the
bottom
of
page
79
and
at
the
top
of
page
80
in
--
in
our
appendix,
he
says
precisely
what
the
courts
have
held
in
--
in
those
cases
to
wit
that
it
is
intended
to
narrow
the
scope
of
its
coverage
in
this
type
of
case.
and
i
might
add,
he
goes
further
than
that.
he
says
some
employees
whose
work
might
meet
the
necessary
test
are
now
outside
the
coverage
of
the
act
because
their
work
is
not
closely
related
and
directly
essential
to
such
production.
we
are
willing
to
meet
him
in
his
own
arena.
on
that
point,
we
think
that
the
1949
amendments
were
written
into
the
act
purposefully
that
they
should
be
given
effect
and
that
their
effect,
as
applied
to
this
case,
is
simply
that
when
our
employees
were
out
on
the
dam
building
that
dam,
they
were
too
remote
to
be
considered
as
being
in
an
occupation
or
process
closely
related
and
directly
essential
to
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
there
is
a
serious
question
about
that
which
we
--
we
did
not
attempt
to
bring
that
when
this
case
came
here
on
certiorari.
the
record
shows
that
the
respondent
had
over
300
employees
working
in
and
about
this
dam.
this
court
has
said
all
the
way
from
kirschbaum
down
to
lublin
that
the
test
is
not
the
business
of
the
employer
it's
the
activity
of
the
particular
employee.
the
government
made
not
a
single
attempt
to
set
forth
in
the
record
what
a
single
want
of
these
300
people
was
doing
on
the
dam.
now,
we
--
we
can
take
it
for
granted,
i
assume,
that
dams
don't
build
themselves.
and
so
in
someway,
somehow,
it
was
before
building
the
dam.
but
there
has
been,
and
we
complained,
we
raised
this
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
because
of
its
disposition
in
the
case,
it
did
not
come
to
it,
there
is
not
an
iota
of
evidence
in
this
record
showing
what
any
single,
what
activity,
any
single
employee
or
respondent
performed
on
this
dam.
we
have
gone
into
greater
detail
in
our
brief
on
other
factors
the
details
that
the
legislative
history
where
congress
itself
at
least
the
house
managers
stated.
now,
they
were
trying
to
--
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
act
and
how
they
in
effect
were
repudiating
some
of
the
decisions
in
the
lower
courts.
we
have
gone
into
detail
in
discussing
the
six
criteria
in
the
labor
department's
own
regulation.
and
we're
prepared
to
meet
them
with
the
test
of
those
six
criteria
in
determining
whether
remoteness
is
or
is
not
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
the
--
there
were
two
opinions,
your
honor,
written
in
this
case.
there
was
a
preliminary
opinion
where
the
court
expressed
the
tentative
view
that
coverage
existed.
he
did
that
almost
entirely
upon
the
basis
of
this
court's
ruling
in
the
vollmer
case.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
i
--
i
was
coming
to
--
to
that
--
that
point.
after
writing
that
first
opinion,
we
--
there
had
been
no
--
no
actual
brief
submitted
to
the
trial
judge.
so,
by
the
end
of
the
second
hearing,
the
question
had
been
briefed
substantially
as
--
as
it
now
appears.
and
the
trial
judge
in
his
second
opinion
in
the
case,
the
opinion
which
terminates
at
least
on
page
--
which
begins
on
page
71
of
the
record.
when
faced
with
the
distinction
which
was
argued,
and
you'll
find
this
on
page
72
of
the
record,
faced
with
the
distinction
which
we
urged
between
the
in
commerce
cases
and
production
of
goods
for
commerce
cases
and
also
with
the
terms
of
the
1949
amendment,
which,
i
say,
the
court
itself
italicized
here,
did
give
consideration
to
them
stating
on
the
top
of
page
73
that
he
too
believe
that
they
undertook
to
narrow
the
scope
of
the
coverage,
but
then
he,
in
effect
said
he
didn't
think
that
they
narrowed
it
this
far.
now,
we
--
we
do
to
your
honors
and
less
i
trespass
on
all
of
my
--
my
colleague's
time.
i
merely
say
that
even
under
the
old
necessary
test
in
the
callus
case,
this
court
concluded
with
the
holding
that
the
activity
there
involved
was
in
the
--
the
court's
words
too
many
steps
removed
from
the
actual
physical
process
of
the
production
of
goods.
we
think
we
have
precisely
that
type
of
situation
here
that
there
are
too
many
steps
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
i
believe
my
answer
would
be
that
we
say
that
he
gave
it
too
broad
in
effect.and
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
that
is
correct.
we
are
not
so
much,
however,
invading
against
the
district
court
as
we
are
upholding
the
analysis
used
by
the
court
from
the
fifth
circuit
in
applying
the
--
the
test
of
close
relationship
and
direct
essentiality.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
no,
sir.
we
--
we
did
not.
i
think
that
whether
--
i
don't
think
you
can
decide
a
case
of
this
kind
by
--
by
the
label
new
or
old
construction.
i
--
i
think
that
the
nature
of
the
construction
has
to
be
based
with
the
test
with
the
1949
amendment.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
i
--
i
believe
to
begin
that
i
would
have
to
say
yes.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
if
the
court
decides
against
to
some
question
of
courage,
certainly,
i
do
not
think
the
court
should
disturb
or
broaden
the
injunction
granted
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
had
a
variety
of
factors
before
including
the
past
record
of
this
employer
the
magnitude
of
the
work
that
it
does
both
in
terms
of
jobs
and
dollars,
the
very
few
instances
where
even
the
government
has
even
contended
that
we
have
stepped
over
the
line.
the
only
other
case
that
we've
ever
been
in
on
the
coverage
was
a
complicated
case,
which
your
honor
cited
in
your
decision
in
the
lublin
case,
a
--
a
war,
a
--
an
army
type
of
--
of
construction
job.
and
in
deciding
that
case
against
us,
the
district
judge
in
albuquerque
said
that
in
his
opinion,
the
question
was
extremely
close
but
he
was
deciding
against
us.
if
we
--
if
we've
done
anything
wrong,
i
think
all
we've
done
wrong
is
to
get
involved
in
two
of
the
closed
cases.
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
did
not
reach
it
and
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
in
the
event
that
your
honors
should
hold
against
us
on
the
question
of
coverage,
the
most
that
we
would
ask
and
all
that
we
think
we
could
ask
would
be
that
the
court
leave
intact
against
us
the
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
which
was
an
injunction
limited
to
this
one
particular
job
which
it
is
true
that
during
the
--
the
months
that
this
litigation
has
been
in
process,
the
job
is
now
pleaded.
under
no
circumstances
though,
we
think,
this
court
should
broaden
that
--
that
injunction.
and
that
is,
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
is
something
that
mr.
johnson
has
prepared
himself
especially
on,
and
if
i
may,
i
would
--
mr.
r.
dean
moorhead
--
turn
--
