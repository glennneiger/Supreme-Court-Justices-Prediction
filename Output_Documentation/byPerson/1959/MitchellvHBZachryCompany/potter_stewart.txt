justice

was
the
sole
--
was
the
sole
asserted
ground
of
coverage
that
this
was
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
rather
than
that
these
employees
were
in
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
and
on
that
part
of
your
case,
you're
talking
about
the
production
of
water
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
itself
entered
into
goods
or
interstate
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
another
fact
is
that
an
injunction
did
issue
in
this
case.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
limited
to
these
facts,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
these
employees.
justice
potter
stewart
for
these
employees
and
these
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
company,
this
--
this
respondent
is
a
general
construction
company,
isn't
it?
and
it's
your
contention
that
in,
what,
185
jobs
that
the
record
shows
that
they've
done,
that
they
automatically
were
within
the
coverage
of
this
federal
statute
on
every
single
job
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
no
matter
what
these
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
were
doing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
there
was
no
contest
about
that,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
an
injunction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
did
issue,
didn't
it?
an
injunction
did
issue,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
you
wanted
the
court
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
burden
of
what?
you've
told
us
in
--
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
just
let
me
finish.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
you've
told
us,
as
i
understand
it
that
this
injunction
isn't
very
burdensome
that
--
that
the
respondents
are
complaining
about
something
else.
justice
potter
stewart
it
merely
isn't
very
much
to
complain
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
all
the
injunction
tells
them
to
do
is
to
obey
the
act.
they
have
that
duty
with
or
without
an
injunction,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
--
what
would
the
difference
be?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
in
--
in
many
public
utilities
cases,
wouldn't
it
be
true
that
the
--
that
the
--
what
was
--
what
was
produced
by
the
public
utility
itself
would
be
the
goods
for
commerce
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
towards
the
gas
and
the
electricity.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
alternative
or
an
alternative
argument
made
by
the
government
here
of
course
that
the
water
itself
is
the
goods
for
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
the
callus
case
was
decided
under
the
old
necessary
case.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
only
the
construction
employees,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
although,
you
don't
rely
very
heavily
on
anything
about
new
construction.
