mr.
robert
j.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
at
the
close
of
the
presentation
of
mr.
reese,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
posed
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
thought
the
state
of
florida
would
apply
its
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
would
apply.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
it
has
not
done
so
in
fact
to
an
out-of-state
contract.
however,
in
the
case
of
hoagland
versus
railway
express
agency,
75
so.2d
822,
it's
in
the
reply
brief,
there
the
court
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
second,
appears
to
have
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
822,
appears
to
have
applied
the
spirit
of
the
statute
that's
under
discussion.
florida
has
a
statute
number
9506
which
is
a
suit
savings
clause
where
a
plaintiff
wins
in
the
lower
court,
loses
on
appeal,
within
one
year
he
may
bring
a
new
suit.
in
the
new
york
shipping
contract
involved
in
that
case,
there
was
a
provision
that
suits
must
be
brought
within
two
years.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
that
contractual
provision
must
give
way
to
the
florida
statute.
so,
they
applied
the
statute,
the
saving
statute
of
limitations
to
that
situation.
that
is
the
only
direct
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
this
was
a
contract
made
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
it
was
made
outside
of
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
no.
this
person
was
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
florida,
shipping
--
shipping
goods
into
florida.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
i
wanted
to
merely
call
your
attention
to
the
case
si.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
that
is
correct.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
case,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
was
outside
of
the
total
contract
provision
of
two
years
in
which
two
years
had
passed.
since
the
institution
of
the
first
suit
in
the
opinions
of
the
circuit
court
in
this
case
they
relied
on
apparently
relied
on
three
cases
pointing
out
the
policy
of
the
state
of
florida
in
connection
with
its
particular
statute
of
limitations.
those
cases
were
respectably
decided
in,
one
in
1917,
one
in
1918.
only
one
of
the
three
dealt
specifically
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
that
was
decided
in
1920
and
dealt
with
this
particular
statute.
this
is
in
84
southern
171.
it's
a
sovereign
camp,
woodman
of
the
world
versus
mignon.
in
that
case,
a
foreign
contract
merely
by
delivery
through
the
agent
in
florida
was
held
to
be
under
the
statute.
the
limiting
provisions
of
the
statute
applied
in
that
instance.
presently
in
florida,
it's
well
known
to
--
i'm
sure
the
members
of
the
court
we
have
a
tremendous
influx
of
population.
we
have
persons
coming
into
florida
that
on
quest
we
are
bringing
a
great
deal
of
personal
property
that
will
be
covered
and
can
be
assumed
by
insurance
policies
of
this
nature.
it
is
entirely
possible
that
in
once
this
company
does
business
in
florida
that
one
person
may
come
from
an
area
such
as
the
chicago
area
into
florida
and
at
that
time
by
a
policy
with
this
company
--
particular
company.
and
nevertheless,
next
door
of
this
individual
in
chicago,
the
same
coverage
applies
in
chicago
based
the
frame
as
did
mr.
clay
three
years
in
advance
comes
into
florida.
both
of
them
sustained
a
loss.
they
have
two
different,
entirely
two
different
limitation
provisions
as
far
bringing
the
suit.
it
seems
somewhat
unreasonable
that
those
men
should
be
differently
situated
before
our
courts.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
yes,
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
they
are
licensed
and
authorized
and
are
doing
business
in
florida.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
they
have
registered
and
qualified
with
the
insurance
commission
of
the
state
of
florida
and
are
presently
doing
business.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
i
think
that
is
the
whole
points
of
what
was
faced.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
i
think
that
such
a
requirement
and
i
think
by
legislation
would
be
--
would
be
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
i
don't
think
there
would
be.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
presently
we
do
not
have
such
a
situation.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
we
are
--
that
is
exactly
correct.
we
are
not
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
i
am
at
loss
to
understand
your
question,
sir,
forgive
me.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
how
they
suitable
--
i
know
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
i
have
not.
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
well
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
what's
that?
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
this
man
is
presently
a
resident,
or
was
a
resident
at
the
time
the
loss
occurred.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
the
policy
where
he
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
illinois.
the
facts
are
different.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
the
facts
are
--
the
facts
are
quite
different.
the
mcgee
case,
california
case
decided
by
this
court
appears
to
be
of
some
assistance
to
florida
as
far
as
the
denial
of
due
process
in
the
application
of
this
statute
to
the
out
of
the
state
conflict.
we
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
well,
there
--
there
has
been
a
question
of
due
process
asserted
by
the
--
i
believe
in
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court
is
whether
the
taking
involved
if
there
is
a
taking
is
a
denial
of
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
my
answer
to
some
of
this
case
was
subsequent
to
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
justice
--
in
the
circuit
court?
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
judge
(inaudible)
in
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
in
miami,
florida,
southern
district
of
miami,
but
the
--
as
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
florida
statute
should
apply,
we
believe
that
it
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
change
in
the
contract
if
that
be
what
it
can
be
called.
the
contract
provision
relates
to
the
beginning
of
suit,
our
statute
merely
postpones
the
time
frames.
it
does
not
destroy
any
of
the
substantive
provisions
so
to
speak
of
the
contract.
the
mcgee
case
indicated
that
under
certain
circumstances,
it's
a
context
in
the
state
were
adequate
that
a
reasonable
taking,
if
that
what
it
legally
amounts
to,
is
proper,
a
limited
taking
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
florida
that
the
taking
involved
in
this
situation
is
reasonable
when
the
fact
of
the
loss
occurring
in
florida,
the
fact
that
the
company
is
authorized
and
was
authorized
to
do
business,
at
the
time
they
had
issued
the
contract
in
illinois,
that
the
contracts
used
in
florida
contained
exactly
the
same
provision
as
the
one
in
illinois,
that
the
situation
can
exist
where
a
man
who
purchases
a
policy
in
florida
from
the
same
company
ends
up
with
a
different
--
applying
for
appearance
before
the
courts
than
does
the
man
who
brings
his
personality
becomes
a
resident
of
the
state
and
brings
a
contract
of
insurance
in
his
pocket
(inaudible)
through
the
man.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
j.
kelly
75,
southern
federal
circuit,
sir.
