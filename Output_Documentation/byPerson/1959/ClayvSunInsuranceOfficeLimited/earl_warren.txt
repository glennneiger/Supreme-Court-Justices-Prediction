chief

you
may
take
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren

mr.
kelly,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
cotton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
all
the
statutes
of
limitations
in
that
book
that
affect
--
that
could
affect
insurance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
insurance
law
and
nothing
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
these
other
ones
are
general
statutes
which
could
affect
the
insurance
or
any
other
kind
of
contract
i
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right
and
what
i
wanted
to
ask
was,
does
that
booklet
that
the
insurance
commissioner
puts
out
include
all
of
the
general
statutes
of
limitations
that
could
under
any
conceivable
situation
applied
to
insurance
or
does
he
purport
put
in
there
only
those
limitations
that
are
directed
at
the
insurance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it's
all
right.
i
thought
--
i
thought
you
might
know.
i
just
â€“
it
doesn't
make
the
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cotton,
in
stating
the
facts,
you
--
you
rarely
stressed
i
thought
the
fact
that
the
property
was
in
illinois
at
the
time
that
the
contract
was
made.
i
was
going
to
ask
you
this.
in
a
worldwide
policy
of
this
--
of
this
kind,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
the
company
whether
the
property
is
in
illinois
or
in
the
neighboring
state
or
at
some
distance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
right,
but
they
would
write
--
they
would
write
the
insurance
policy
of
this
kind
if
the
property
had
been
in
the
state
other
than
illinois
at
the
time.
chief
justice

warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
cotton.
