justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
had
florida
could've
known
--
but
the
case
of
the
watts
case
which
this
court
decided
and
it
would
have
to
have
it
to
legislation
need
to
pass
a
law
like
that
in
order
to
get
service
on
these
people
or
to
make
--
applies
laws
to
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
a
case
of
louisiana
several
years
ago
in
which
questions
similar
to
this
came
up.
how
can
anyone
assume
setting
on
this
bench
the
legislature
applied
in
view
that
anyone
sitting
on
this
bench
would
say
that
they
were
not
doing
this
because
they
were
not
using
the
right
language
and
none
on
which
they
did
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
just
wondering
how
the
legislature
of
florida
could
know
would
have
to
meet
the
condition
that
just
an
ineptitude
from
the
bench?
from
my
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
doubt
about
it
and
now
i
rather
thought,
maybe
we
have
laid
it
to
rest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
a
--
there
was
an
opinion
by
eight
members,
an
opinion
by
concur
and
they
approached
the
case
quite
differently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
whether
there
was
any
question
raised
by
the
defendant
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
statute
of
florida
applied?
i
see
an
answer
which
indicates
that
it
might
be
unconstitutional,
but
is
there
one
which
raised
the
question
and
challenged
the
application
of
the
laws.
the
statute
applied
on
grounds
that
it
didn't
cover
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
sat
on
the
case?
who
tried
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
--
is
the
chart
in
the
court
here
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
this
printed
record.
it's
in
--
i
don't
see
it
in
the
record.
maybe
it's
--
that's
the
reason
i
was
asking
you
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
part
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
where
is
the
place
where
you
raised
the
question
about
the
florida
statute?
if
it
was
constitutional
to
apply,
would
not
be
applied
in
that
way
by
florida?
where
did
you
raise
that
petition
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
read
the
answer.
is
all
the
answer
in
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
object
that
you
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
the
state
(inaudible)
of
florida
was
--
is
this
applicability
was
confirmed
and
that
somebody
is
constitutionally
or
the
contract
law.
assuming
it
applied
--
assuming
that
florida
law
could
go
in,
where
did
you
raise
the
question
that
the
florida
statute
which
was
not
as
the
florida
judge,
judge
(inaudible)
held
it
to
be
applicable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
(inaudible)
where
was
it
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
it
says
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that
insofar
as
your
challenge
to
applying
florida
law
is
concerned.
where
is
your
challenge,
either
there
or
in
your
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
your
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
argued
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
even
if
florida
could
apply,
this
statute
didn't
govern?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
first
time
you
raised
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
it's
not
in
the
record.
i
can't
find
it
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
--
when
you
appeal
that
the
court
of
appeals,
did
you
have
to
assign
errors
or
give
notes
of
the
challenges
you're
making?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
rules
in
the
fifth
circuit,
how
do
you
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
okay,
did
you
state
when
you
took
the
case
up
what
the
points
were
on
which
you
challenged
the
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
point
is
being
raised
that
you
didn't
raise
yourself.
well,
i
see
--
i
do
not
see
any
place
in
the
record
where
you
raised
that
point.
you've
been
asked
questions
about
it
here
but
i
do
not
see
where
you
raised
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
could
take
it
up
of
its
own
motion,
it
may
well
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
i
understand,
that's
raised,
undoubtedly
that
is
raised
that
the
law
of
illinois
--
you
raised
the
question
contract
should
be
governed
by
the
law
of
illinois
because
that's
the
constitutional
point
that
you
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
have
you
ever
put
that
anywhere
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
include
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
have
any
other
part
of
the
record
that
show
you
ever
raised
this
question,
if
you
did
raise
it
in
the
brief
before
the
brief,
will
you
include
that
you
and
your
adversary,
get
it
--
can
some
way
to
us
so
i
can
see
where
you
raised
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
were
stating
about
the
number
of
states
that
have
laws
--
i
didn't
quite
understand.
you
say
how
many
have
--
how
many
states
have
law
and
that
do
not
have
laws
that
provide
that
state
statute
of
limitation
shall
not
be
shortened
by
the
company's
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
stated
it,
maybe
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
are
fire
--
these
are
fire
policies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
look
it
up,
i
had
an
idea
that
frankly
all
of
the
states
bar
contract
to
the
clauses
and
held
in
act
that
might
try
to
short
the
state
statute
of
limitations.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
maybe
i
am
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
look
it
up
by
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
attached
--
