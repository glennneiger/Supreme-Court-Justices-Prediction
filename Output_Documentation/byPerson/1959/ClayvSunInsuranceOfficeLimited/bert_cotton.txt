mr.
bert
cotton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first,
if
i
may,
to
address
myself
to
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
black
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
florida
legislature
would
be
in
a
position
to
be
aware
of
the
requirements
found
to
be
sufficient
in
the
watson
case.
the
legislature
of
the
florida
has
two
statutes
as
part
of
the
florida
insurance
law,
wherein
they
reach
out
beyond
the
state
borders
and
wherein
in
so
doing,
they
have
all
of
the
requirements
which
were
found
in
the
watson
case,
a
full
declaration
of
policy,
a
full
declaration
of
the
evil
or
problem
to
be
dealt
with
and
a
positive
assertion
of
the
need
and
necessity
and
desire
to
reach
out
beyond
state
borders.
i
refer
specifically
to
one
--
one
of
the
statutes
to
which
i
refer
is
the
very
statute
that
this
court
had
before
it
in
the
mcgee
case,
service
on
--
on
unauthorized
insurers
who
send
policies
in
or
do
things
by
mail.
florida
has
a
complete
statute
probably
word
for
word
in
respect
to
the
statute
that
your
honors
have
before
you
which
was
a
california
statute.
i
would
like
to
point
out
further
that
florida,
its
courts
have
never
sought
to
give
their
statutes
extraterritorial
effect
except
for
these
instances
to
which
i
refer.
there
is
a
case
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
a
case
involving
a
florida
statute
which
provides
that
if
a
person
dies
in
the
state
of
florida,
leaving
life
insurance,
then
there
are
certain
restrictions
on
the
manner
in
which
the
proceeds
of
that
insurance
maybe
payable,
must
go
to
wife,
children,
or
certain
protection
for
the
family.
in
that
case,
the
insurer
had
procured
his
policy
elsewhere,
i
believe
in
alabama,
some
other
state
where
there
was
no
such
restriction.
he
thereafter
became
a
resident
of
florida.
he
died
in
florida
and
there
was
a
dispute
between
those
who
would
be
entitled
to
the
proceeds
of
the
policy
if
the
florida
statute
applied
and
those
who
would
be
entitled
to
the
proceeds
if
the
designation
made
by
the
assured
was
valid.
and
the
court
said
very
expressly
that
although
the
statute
doesn't
have
any
--
anything
in
it
to
say
it
applies
only
to
life
insurance
policies
issued
in
the
state
and
although
the
statute
says
if
any
person
dies
in
the
state
leaving
insurance,
this
shall
be
the
rule,
nevertheless,
it
is
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
contract
was
made
which
governs
and
we
have
no
right
to
extend
our
statute
outside
of
state
borders
to
attach
itself
to
such
contract.
mr.
bert
cotton
and
under
a
life
insurance
policy.
mr.
bert
cotton
at
the
time
of
his
death.
mr.
bert
cotton
your
honor,
i
can't
say
that
it's
a
non-florida
company.
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
company
must
have
been
authorized
to
do
business
in
florida,
because
it
was
sued
in
florida.
mr.
bert
cotton
the
state
law
or
the
state
law
--
the
policy
was
issued
had
no
regulation.
mr.
bert
cotton
had
none
and
the
designation
of
beneficiary
which
the
insured
had
made.
mr.
bert
cotton
in
the
contract,
that's
right.
mr.
bert
cotton
correct,
correct.
mr.
bert
cotton
the
florida
court
held
that
--
mr.
bert
cotton
that
the
--
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
and
therefore,
the
insurer's
designation
of
beneficiary
remained.
it
was
not
voided
by
the
florida
statute.
mr.
bert
cotton
correct,
sir.
mr.
bert
cotton
equitable
life
insurance
society
against
mcree,

fla.

78
so.
22.
mr.
bert
cotton
78
so.
22.
mr.
bert
cotton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
cotton
oh,
i
--
i
believe
it
is
sir,
i
mean
--
mr.
bert
cotton
there
are
excerpts
--
mr.
bert
cotton
--
from
the
chart
page
25
and
26.
mr.
bert
cotton
well,
that
was
raised
in
this
fashion.
i
would
submit,
the
answer
--
mr.
bert
cotton
yes,
sir.
mr.
bert
cotton
yes,
sir
it
is.
mr.
bert
cotton
so
far
as
the
--
mr.
bert
cotton
your
honor,
i
submit
that
that
would
have
been
raised
--
mr.
bert
cotton
i
say
within
the
framework
of
this
answer,
of
this
very
answer
which
alleges
that
it
was
a
contract
made
in
illinois.
mr.
bert
cotton
in
which
event,
i
was
--
i
would
judge
that
–
the
balance
would
be
a
question
of
law
as
to
whether
or
not
the
florida
statute
would
be
held
to
apply
to
a
contract
made
in
illinois.
mr.
bert
cotton
it
was
in
the
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
cannot
cite
--
mr.
bert
cotton
no,
it
was
raised
below.
mr.
bert
cotton
well,
it
is
not
the
record
and
therefore,
it
would
be
raised
in
connection
i
believe
that
there
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
where
the
entire
defense
was
eliminated
from
the
case
the
court
holding
two
fold
that
the
florida
statute
applied
and
that
it
could
constitutionally
apply
and
therefore
the
defense
was
not
even
litigated
in
the
trial.
it
was
out
by
the
time
the
trial
started.
it's
not
--
mr.
bert
cotton
the
appeal
--
mr.
bert
cotton
your
honor
i
am
unable
to
answer
your
question
with
respect
to
the
rules
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
bert
cotton
that
would
--
that
was
stated
in
several
places.
if
your
honor
will
give
me
one
moment,
i
will
--
mr.
bert
cotton
all
right,
your
honor,
it
is
raised
-
mr.
bert
cotton
yes,
sir.
but
i
believe
it
is
raised
and
i
believed
--
mr.
bert
cotton
well,
on
page
7
of
the
transcript.
there
is
the
assertion
that
the
law
to
be
applied
in
regard
to
the
clause
is
the
substantive
law
of
illinois
and
not
and
the
law
of
the
forum.
mr.
bert
cotton
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
only
the
constitutional
point.
i
believe
sir
that
in
raising
the
question
that
the
law
of
illinois
governs,
that
necessarily
raises
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
florida
statute
should
be
construed
to
apply
to
it.
not
as
matter
of
constitutional
--
mr.
bert
cotton
well
--
mr.
bert
cotton
it
is
certainly
in
the
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
very
strongly
argued.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
has
a
section
in
its
opinion
in
which
it
discusses
whether
or
not
the
florida
statute
would
be
held
to
apply
to
an
illinois
contract.
mr.
bert
cotton
sure
sir.
mr.
bert
cotton
certainly,
sir.
now,
with
respect
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
or
not
the
interest
of
the
state
of
florida
in
this
contract
in
relation
to
the
--
its
status
of
an
illinois
policy
or
an
illinois
contract
was
concerned,
i
would
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
following.
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
policy
was
issued
and
delivered
in
illinois
and
the
full
premium
paid
in
illinois
and
the
insured
was
at
that
time
a
resident
of
illinois,
we
have
the
following
things.
under
illinois
--
under
the
illinois
insurance
code,
this
form
of
policy
must
be
filed
with
the
insurance
commissioner,
must
be
approved
by
the
insurance
commissioner
and
the
issuance
of
any
policy
of
a
different
form
would
be
illegal
and
a
violation
of
illinois
law.
it's
fully
controlled
both
as
to
form
and
as
to
rates
by
the
filings
to
the
illinois
commissioner.
the
plaintiff,
mr.
clay
was
a
resident
of
illinois.
therefore,
this
was
not
a
matter
of
this
company
choosing
issue
policy
in
illinois.
it
had
no
choice
but
to
issue
this
policy
because
that's
what
the
law
of
illinois
required.
the
premiums
attached
in
illinois.
the
honorary
premium
reserves,
this
being
the
policy
issued
in
illinois
are
governed
by
the
law
of
illinois.
loss
reserves
are
subject
to
control,
subject
to
review
by
the
illinois
commissioner.
at
the
time
the
policy
was
issued,
mrs.
clay
owned
the
residence
which
is
named
as
the
residence
of
the
assured.
they
are
attached
to
the
policy
of
fine
arts
writer
which
covers
six
paintings.
the
writer
says
that
these
paintings
are
covered
for
the
full
amount
of
insurance
in
that
place
and
for
only
10%
elsewhere.
not
one
single
act
occurred
after
the
assured
move
from
illinois
to
florida.
no
endorsements,
no
premiums,
no
contact
whatever,
nothing.
we
tried
to
the
interest
of
florida
and
we
find
that
all
we
have
is
that
after
the
policy
attached
and
if
i
might
to
address
for
a
minute
say,
“mr.
reese
said
that
they
moved
shortly
after
the
policy
was
taken
out,
and
it
was
probably
two
or
three
months.”
well,
the
case
can't
be
controlled
by
whether
three
months
or
two
years.
it
was
sometime
during
the
policy
term
that
they
moved.
at
the
time
of
this
loss,
they
had
some
--
they
had
property
in
florida.
they
also
had
property
elsewhere.
this
is
all
movable
property.
these
are
all
personal
property.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
yesterday
about
the
bank
that
this
covers
worldwide,
it
covers
worldwide
on
property
that
had
no
situs
just
as
in
the
delta
&
pine
case
this
court
pointed
out
that
what
was
insured
there
had
no
situs.
it
would
cover
all
of
them.
now,
with
respect
to
delta
&
pine
and
its
application
to
this
case,
there
were
more
reasons
in
delta
&
pine
for
giving
mississippi
the
right
to
have
its
statute
reach
out
to
a
contract
made
in
tennessee
than
there
are
in
this
case.
in
delta
&
pine,
the
insured
was
a
resident
cooperate
--
was
a
cooperation
of
the
state
of
mississippi
at
the
time
that
the
policy
was
issued.
it
happened
to
have
its
principal
place
of
business
in
tennessee
and
that's
where
it
happened
to
get
the
policy,
but
the
policy
or
bond
covered
employees
in
memphis
and
employees
in
five
named
cities
in
mississippi
at
the
time
it
was
issued.
the
fact
that
the
treasurer
who
was
in
the
home
office
in
memphis
then
moved
when
the
company
moved
its
main
office
to
a
state
of
incorporation
back
to
state
of
incorporation
was
held
by
this
court
to
be
insufficient.
so,
we
have
a
policy
issued
to
a
resident
corporation
of
mississippi
covering
property
or
covering
people
or
activities
in
mississippi
at
the
time
of
issuance
and
nevertheless,
as
the
court
held
that
the
contacts
of
mississippi
were
inadequate.
now,
we
contrast
that
with
the
policy
and
the
principles
which
underlie
the
watson
case.
in
the
watson
case,
where
you
have
as
this
court
pointed
out
an
interstate
business,
a
business
that
goes
all
over
the
country,
it's
only
home
permanence
(inaudible)
consequently
when
the
gillet
company
was
negotiated
--
or
when
the
gillet
company
procured
its
policy
with
the
employers'
liability
in
massachusetts
or
illinois
whichever
state
is
the
one
that
was
the
site
of
the
contact,
there
came
into
being
a
contract
which
at
that
very
moment
was
of
interest
to
the
state
of
louisiana
because
tony
was
sent
into
louisiana
and
people
in
louisiana
might
be
injured.
and
the
state
of
louisiana
had
a
very
manifest
interest
in
the
protection
of
its
citizens
because
they
might
have
to
travel
to
massachusetts
to
sue
the
gillet
company
if
they
were
injured.
this
court
observed
that
the
statute
was
a
part
of
an
overall
and
comprehensive
insurance
law
that
it
made
it
very
clear
dealing
with
an
evil
and
it
was
seeking
to
overcome
the
evil.
we
tried
to
the
statute
involved
in
this
case.
it's
been
one
of
the
sections
of
the
statute
of
limitation
since
1913,
unchanged
since
1913.
in
the
insurance
commissioner's
--
before
the
insurance
commissioner's
compilation
of
the
laws
of
florida
affecting
insurance,
a
booklet
which
includes
all
of
the
insurance
code
and
many
other
laws
affecting
insurance,
you
do
not
find
this
section.
the
manner
of
the
strong
public
policy
is
to
some
extent
negated
by
the
fact
that
pursuant
to
a
florida
statute
which
authorizes
the
insurance
commissioner
to
issue
pamphlets
and
booklets
and
to
distribute
them
to
the
public
and
to
the
governor
and
the
members
of
the
cabinet
and
authorizes
there
being
in
question
and
to
form
for
the
education
of
agents
for
the
justice
and
what
have
you,
there
appears
under
the
fire
and
allied
alliance
which
is
the
kind
of
policy
we're
talking
about
here
a
question,
“what
is
the
limit
of
time
for
the
bringing
of
suit
on
a
policy?”
answer
-
12
months
from
the
occurrence
of
the
loss.
now,
we
are
criticized
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
by
the
attorney
general
for
citing
a
--
a
publication
issued
by
the
insurance
commissioner
saying
that
doesn't
make
the
law
and
insurance
commissioner
that
doesn't
make
the
policy.
we
do
not
claim
that
this
shows
what
the
law
of
florida
is.
we
claim
only
that
if
they
were
a
strong
public
policy
in
the
state
of
florida
against
one
year
suit
clauses,
then
most
certainly,
the
man
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
insurance
law
of
florida
certainly
would
be
the
one
to
know
about
it
and
to
state
it
in
an
educational
pamphlet
on
which
florida
adjustor
was
supposed
to
be
governed
and
to
learn
their
trade.
mr.
bert
cotton
in
this
booklet
--
mr.
bert
cotton
--
issued
by
the
commissioner?
not
the
limitations,
but
they
do
have
these
things
which
do
indicate
that
it
was
drawn
in
reference
to
the
florida
insurance
laws.
florida
has
a
value
policy
law
which
of
course
is
different
from
the
provisions
of
the
new
york
standard
fire
policy
which
has
been
adopted
by
florida.
there's
a
special
reference
in
the
value
policy
law.
florida
has
another
statute
to
similar
import
that
you
must
collect
insurance
for
the
amount
on
which
you
pay
the
premium,
that's
mentioned.
mr.
bert
cotton
yes,
sir.
mr.
bert
cotton
the
statute
is
very
general
and
--
mr.
bert
cotton
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
i
can
reliably
answer
that
because
--
mr.
bert
cotton
well,
i
want
to
say
that
the
pamphlet
covers
many
things,
disability
insurance
and
life
insurance
and
we
did
not
study
it
for
that
purpose
so
i
cannot
answer
this
question.
now,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
one
year
suit
clause
has
been
evil,
whether
or
not
it
is
something
which
creates
a
problem
on
which
the
state
should
have
or
can
have
and
in
this
case
we
say
florida
did
not
have
any
positive
opposing
policy.
the
new
york
standard
of
fire
insurance
policy
since
the
first
addition
back
in
1883
has
always
contained
the
one
year
suit
clause.
the
latest
version
of
it
which
is
the
1943
standard
policy
contains
the
--
in
substance
the
same
clause
requiring
the
suit
be
brought
within
one
year
from
the
inception
of
the
loss,
incidentally
a
harsher
provision
than
this
one
because
this
one
says
one
year
from
discovery.
i
mean,
that's
the
delay
and
discovery
that
is
not
something
that
prejudice
will
be
assured.
the
new
york
standard
policy
is
adopted
in
42
states
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
--
i'm
sorry,
46
states
and
the
district
of
columbia,
as
is,
without
a
change.
in
42
states
--
i'm
stating
it
wrong,
46
states
but
in
42
plus
the
district
of
columbia,
there
was
no
change
as
to
the
one
year
suit
clause.
in
four
of
the
states,
they've
adopted
longer
limitation,
15
months
in
california,
two
years
in
two
of
the
other
states.
it's
been
recognized
in
the
opinions
of
courts
and
recognized
by
insurance
commissioners
that
the
longer
the
time
to
sue,
the
longer
the
necessity
for
maintaining
reserves
and
they
snowball
because
of
the
number
of
losses
reported
only
a
fraction
of
thereafter
pursued
for
any
one
of
the
number
of
reasons.
if
--
kentucky
has
a
15-year
statute
of
limitations
on
contract.
kentucky
happens
to
be
a
state
by
the
court
which
held
that
its
statute
--
its
invalidating
statute
does
not
apply
to
contracts
made
elsewhere.
but,
if
you
have
reserves
piled
up
one
on
top
of
another,
year
after
year,
you
reach
a
point
where
your
reserves
make
the
company
insolvent
as
far
as
its
balance
is
concerned
and
the
only
remedy
for
maintaining
a
solvent
position
would
be
the
increase
of
premiums.
and
so,
there
is
an
overall
public
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
there
is
some
reasonable
limit
on
the
duration
of
time
for
which
a
reserve
has
to
be
maintained.
and
so,
for
that
reason,
we
find
that
42
states
plus
the
district
of
columbia
have
accepted
the
one
year
limit
as
a
proper
and
reasonable
limit.
mr.
bert
cotton
that's
true.
mr.
bert
cotton
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
bert
cotton
they
are
--
mr.
bert
cotton
they
are
related
in
many
respects
although
in
certain
respects,
they
perform
different
functions.
they
are
related
in
this
sense
that
immediate
notice
to
enable
prompt
investigation
before
the
facts
get
stale
and
witnesses
are
unavailable
or
witnesses
die
is
tied-in
with
the
requirement
that
the
suit
be
brought
on
time
because
of
same
considerations
applied
in
the
suit
clause.
i
would
assume
that
with
respect
to
the
limitation
on
the
time
to
sue,
that
limitation
controls
the
time
when
you
can
slide
off
your
reserves
whereas
the
notice
controls
the
time
when
you
start
--
when
you
put
the
reserve
on
them
in
the
first
place
so
that
they
move
in
opposite
directions
so
to
speak
to
that
extent,
but
the
opinions
that
have
spelt
the
same
kind
of
problem.
mr.
bert
cotton
well,
the
premiums
are
in
an
overall
--
on
an
overall
basis
affected
by
the
length
of
time
on
which
--
for
which
you
have
to
maintain
your
reserves.
if
your
reserves
pile
up,
your
premiums
have
to
go
up
in
order
for
you
to
be
solvent.
so
they
--
they
are
affected
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
you
maintain
that
the
one
year
limitation
is
not
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
should
like
to
point
out
this.
the
one
year
limitation
is
easily
waived.
the
courts
have
found
all
the
time,
if
there
is
any
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
insured
which
misleads
the
insured
so
that
it
doesn't
bring
suit
in
time
the
floor
–
it
is
waved.
if
there
is
any
impossibility
which
prevents
the
insured
from
bringing
the
suit
in
time,
the
insured
is
not
thus
precluded
from
his
lawsuit.
this
is
not
a
trap.
this
is
not
anything
but
an
attempt
in
line
with
what
i
submit
has
been
the
generally
policy
of
the
boards
to
not
to
expand
the
time
when
matters
remain
open
and
undisposed
of,
but
to
contract
that
period
to
the
extent
possible.
mr.
bert
cotton
yes,
sir.
mr.
bert
cotton
no,
your
honor
no
--
no
suggestion
was
made
by
either
side.
mr.
bert
cotton
we
--
mr.
bert
cotton
well,
we
have
the
analysis
sir
to
this
extent.
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
dealt
with
the
statutory
fire
policy
because
that
is
the
policy
which
has
nationwide
acceptance,
nationwide
contacts
so
that
we
can
make
a
survey
desk
with
the
standard
fire
policy.
out
of
the
46
states
plus
the
district
of
columbia
which
have
adopted
the
new
york
standard
policy
either
by
statute
or
by
insurance
--
the
insurance
commissioner,
42
have
adopted
it
without
any
statutory
change.
certain
of
them
have
special
provision
for
increased
time.
we
have
not
attempted
to
catalogue
those
states
which
have
provisions
of
general
nature
invalidating
these
when
you're
--
mr.
bert
cotton
these
are
fire
policies
sir
which
have
the
--
mr.
bert
cotton
well,
sir,
i
--
i
would
not
--
mr.
bert
cotton
no,
no,
not
with
respect
to
just
really
policies.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
florida
has
in
its
own
insurance
code,
a
shortening
of
the
--
of
their
own
statute
of
limitations
on
disability.
mr.
bert
cotton
by
statute,
sir
in
the
insurance
code.
mr.
bert
cotton
yes,
sir.
mr.
bert
cotton
in
this
policy,
although
it
is
worldwide
and
would
cover
loss
no
matter
where
it
occurs,
there
is
a
requirement
on
the
face
of
the
policy
that
the
insured
state
what
portion
of
its
property
is
in
the
place
of
principle
residence
which
is
the
address
stated
in
the
policy.
the
premiums
--
and
this
is
not
on
the
record,
your
honor
as
i
am
--
mr.
bert
cotton
--
stating
this
without
identifying
the
record,
the
premiums
are
determined
by
rating
bureaus
dependent
on
the
particular
risks
in
the
state
where
the
policy
is
issued.
this,
despite
the
fact
that
if
a
man
moves
from
the
place
of
issuance
to
another
resident
--
in
another
state,
the
company
has
no
way
of
doing
anything
about
it.
mr.
bert
cotton
but
if
the
insured
are
resident
of
illinois
and
--
mr.
bert
cotton
--
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
bert
cotton
they
moved
some
of
the
property.
the
record
shows
that
at
the
time
of
the
loss,
they
had
property
in
somewhere
other
than
florida
than
so
where
that
they
had
property
other
than
in
florida
at
the
time.
mr.
bert
cotton
yes,
sir,
personal
property.
mr.
bert
cotton
no,
sir
they
were
not.
mr.
bert
cotton
they
didn't
have
to
do
anything
and
in
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general,
it
is
stated
that
the
company
knew
that
they
had
moved.
i
think
the
statement
reads
too
much
into
a
very
brief
bit
of
testimony.
the
--
there
was
a
general
agent
in
chicago
to
whom
this
policy
had
been
issued
to
mr.
clay
while
he
was
a
resident
of
chicago.
this
general
agent
carried
all
of
mr.
clay's
insurance
and
various
claims
and
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
company.
the
question
is,
“did
you
get
in
touch
with
bartholomew
after
--
after
you
moved
to
florida?”
the
answer
is
yes,
but
we
don't
know
when.
that
may
have
been
after
the
loss
occurred.
this
may
have
been
in
connection
with
the
policies
of
some
other
company
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
defendant.
that's
all
there
is
all
the
requirements
that
the
company
be
notified.
mr.
bert
cotton
i
don't
believe
so,
unless
it
has
to
do
with
the
notification
of
loss
after
the
loss
occurred.
i
think
the
only
sentence
with
respect
to
anything
other
than
notification
of
loss
is
the
one
question,
“did
you
get
in
touch
with
them
after
you
moved
to
florida?”
the
answer
is
yes.
