justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
could
you
tell
us
when
the
policy
was
issued
and
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
insured
was
then
living
in
chicago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
that
clause
again,
the
one
you
just
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
issued?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
get
that.
why
should
--
this
--
this
policy
was
issued
in
--
in
illinois,
in
chicago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
what
you've
just
read
said
that,
if
such
a
clause
or
years
--
that
suit
must
be
brought
within
a
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
invalid
in
any
state
in
which
it
is
issued?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
it
wasn't
issued
in
florida,
was
it?
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
their
clause
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
clause
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
is
the
--
the
insurance
companies
do
business
in
many
states
and
this
is
a
form
of
contract
so
that
they
don't
have
to
have
a
special
printing
for
florida
or
georgia
or
whatever
it
is,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
did
you
say
1957,
that
such
a
statute
was
passed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
just
what
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
assuming,
are
you
not
that
that
--
the
florida
statute
applies
to
this
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
that
and
there's
no
florida
case
deciding
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
alabama
isn't
florida.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
states
would
agree
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
they
haven't
said
they
applied
to
insurance
contracts
written
outside
the
state,
but
are
then
residents
of
the
riding
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
the
point
i'm
putting
here.
that's
the
point
i'm
putting
to
you.
that
all
we
know,
the
florida
supreme
court
might
decide
that
that
isn't
the
law,
but
that
the
statute
is
not
to
be
applied
to
this
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
courts
do
strange
things,
won't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
court
has
decided
in
some
cases,
where
you
could
observe
exactly
that
--
that
it
wouldn't
be
even
constitutional
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
this
notice
of
--
this
requirement
of
notice
was
against
the
law
of
mississippi,
where
a
suit
was
brought.
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
that's
all
right.
mississippi
law
governs.
indeed,
the
insurance
company
was
actually
--
had
its
main
office
in
mississippi.
and
this
court
said
that
that
couldn't
constitutionally
be
done.
i'm
not
saying
there's
an
exact
case,
but
it's
a
case
that
was
possibly
going
to
be
less
sure
that
your
supreme
court
might
hold
that
this
statute
is
not
applicable
to
this
situation.
i'm
not
saying
it
would,
but
i
guess
i'm
less
sure
than
you
are
that
it
would
be,
anyhow
we
don't
know,
do
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
mississippi
said
that
was
against
its
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
it
was
used
to
enforce
it.
and
this
court
said
it
couldn't
change
the
contact
which
had
been
written
elsewhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
questions
of
notice,
giving
notice
within
a
limited
time
and
bringing
(inaudible)
have
not
unrelated
purposes.
they're
directed
towards
similar
--
with
similar
concerns
namely,
the
early
period
during
which
of
--
the
insurance
company
should
know
in
order
that
it
may
adjust
itself
to
what
is
relevant
in
keeping
reserves,
the
claims
outstanding,
the
relation
of
the
premium
to
the
claims
outstanding
into
the
reserves,
etcetera,
etcetera.
but
notice
and
the
statute
of
limitation
do
not
deal
with
such
different
matters,
subject
matters,
but
you
can
say
the
delta
case
has
no
relevance
to
this
problem,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
giving
notice
within
the
given
period
of
time
is
a
form
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
cuts
off
the
right
to
bring
an
action
unless
you
give
notice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
would
--
did
you
say
wouldn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
not
whether
it
would,
but
it
is
has
it
done
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
75
southern?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page?
have
you
got
the
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
stated
all
the
circumstances
of
the
situation?
is
this
a
contract
made
outside
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
outside
of
florida?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
persons
then
outside
of
florida,
by
non
--
at
the
time,
a
non
citizen
of
florida?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
me,
that's
a
very
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
to
that,
your
associate
say
yesterday
this
company
--
this
insurance
company,
the
sun
insurance
company
is
authorized
to
do
business
in
florida,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
you
can
keep
them
out
if
you
wanted
to,
but
you
allowed
them
to
come
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
meet
your
problem
in
a
very
different
way
to
changing
the
terms
of
the
contract
because
of
the
terms
of
the
contract
are
changed
presently
but
you
may
change
it
in
view
of
your
local
policy,
that's
true
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
you
–
couldn't
you
deem
with
the
problems
very
effectively
by
conditioning
admission
of
this
company
or
any
other
company
it
imply
and
doing
business
imply
by
a
requirement
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
difficulty
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
are
we
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
florida
is
hopeless
or
helpless
in
dealing
with
the
problems
which
you
just
–
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
read
the
watson
case,
haven't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
suppose
justice
black's
question
and
mine,
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
in
the
watson
case,
it
arose
in
connection
of
the
resident
louisiana
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
you
haven't
got
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he's
a
resident
when
the
policy
was
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
it?
i
understand
you
to
say
that
florida
has
one
--
one
provision
for
distribution
of
a
deceased
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
life
insurance
policy
that
a
deceased
who
was
a
citizen
or
resident
of
--
so
far
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
of
time
of
his
death
had
--
was
insured
in
a
non-florida
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
a
contract
made
outside
of
florida
under
a
state
law
of
that
state
which
had
a
different
policy
or
distribution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
none?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would've
fallen
under
florida
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
your
court
held
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
florida
court,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
although
a
contract
made
in
further
which
such
a
designation
of
the
beneficiary
would've
fallen
because
of
the
florida
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
--
i
think
the
attorney
general
mentioned
the
case
in
75.
justice
felix
frankfurter
75
federal
circuit
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
and
this
is
75
fla.
and
--
and
what
are
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
be
good
enough
to
submit
the
reach
that
they
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
decided
what
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
cotton?
there
are
two
limitations
in
policies,
aren't
they?
there
is
limitation
on
--
limitation
i
am
using
the
word
loosely
and
not
on
the
statute
on
the
limitation
then
which
one,
the
requirement
is
to
give
notice
within
definite
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
other
is
the
state
statute
of
limitation
or
--
or
--
one
requirement
--
limitation
of
time
for
giving
notice
of
the
injury
or
loss.
two,
the
requirement
of
the
limitation
of
time
within
which
suit
must
be
brought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
does
this
--
are
both
relevant
--
are
both
considerations
relevant
to
or
do
they
clear
part
in
either
the
fixation
of
the
premiums
or
the
requirement
of
the
reserves
or
do
they
fulfill
--
are
they
directed
to
different
functions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
see
the
notice
of
the
--
of
the
injury
--
of
an
injury
or
loss
that
you
may
witness,
but
it
may
not
get
stale
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
now,
are
those
what
--
what
is
the
bearing
of
those
two
considerations?
what
are
the
--
what
is
the
bearing
of
those
two
considerations
on
what
might
be
called
and
i
am
about
to
use
the
word
“legitimate
interest”
as
against
trapping
the
unwary
by
having
short
--
short
notices?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
fixing
of
the
scale
of
premiums
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
that
they've
got
a
shortest
statute
limitation
for
disability
than
the
fire
lawsuit?
