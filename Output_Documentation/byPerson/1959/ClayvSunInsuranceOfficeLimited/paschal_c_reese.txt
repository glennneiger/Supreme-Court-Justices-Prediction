mr.
paschal
c.
reese
may
it
please
it
court.
may
i
have
permission
to
request
that
mr.
robert
j.
kelly,
assistant
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
florida.
in
the
place
of
richard
w.
ervin,
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
florida,
appearing
--
amicus
curiae
and
this
case
to
be
allowed
to
use
10
minutes
of
my
allotted
time?
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
thank
you.
if
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
case
in
which
john
clay,
in
--
in
april
1952,
being
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
illinois,
purchased
a
personal
property
floater
policy,
through
the
agent
of
the
respondent,
sun
insurance
office
limited,
in
chicago
and
paid
at
that
time,
a
three-year
premium.
about
six
weeks,
after
the
purchase
of
the
policy,
the
petitioner,
together
with
his
family,
moved
to
the
state
of
florida
and
soon
thereafter,
purchased
property
in
palm
beach
county,
florida,
near
the
city
of
clewiston
and
lived
and
resided
in
florida
continuously
from
may
or
--
from
may
or
june
of
1952,
until
the
damage
claimed
--
occurred
in
the
fall
of
1954
and
january
of
1955.
a
claim
was
filed
under
the
floater
policy
--
personal
property
floater
policy,
claiming
that
certain
property
had
been
stolen
and
a
certain
other
property
had
been
destroyed
and
that
vandalism
had
occurred
to
certain
photographs
and
pictures.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
the
policy
was
issued
on
april
22,
1952,
in
chicago.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
the
insured
was
living
in
chicago.
the
policy
was
dated
the
22nd
of
april,
1952.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
at
that
time
for
the
benefit
of
the
insurance
company
and,
of
course,
some
benefit
for
the
petitioner,
that
a
premium
of
three
years
was
paid,
which
paid
the
policy
up
until
--
or
the
premium
of
the
policy
to
april
22nd,
1955.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
it's
a
world-wide
policy.
all
of
the
property
of
its
petitioner
was
moved
to
the
state
of
florida
and
the
--
the
damage
occurred
in
the
state
of
florida.
in
answering
the
complaint
which
was
admitted
and
filed
more
than
one
year
after
the
insurance
company
had
refused
to
--
to
honor
the
claim.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
at
the
time
the
policy
was
issued,
they
were
qualified
to
transact
business
in
florida.
the
policy,
itself,
contained
the
usual
clause
that
all
of
these
policies
have
to
the
effect
that
a
suit
must
be
brought
within
12
months
following
the
discovery
of
the
loss,
but
it
goes
ahead
--
goes
on
with
the
--
provided
however,
that
if
for
the
laws
of
the
state
within
which
this
policy
is
issued,
such
limitation
is
invalid,
then
that
suit
clause
in
the
policy
becomes
invalid.
now,
the
state
of
florida,
had
a
statute
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
provided
however,
that
if
by
the
laws
of
the
state
within
which
this
policy
is
issued.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
such
limitation
is
invalid.
then,
the
suit
clause,
requiring
suit
within
12
months,
is
invalid.
the
state
of
florida
has
the
statute
section
95.03,
at
the
time
the
suit
was
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
no,
sir.
it
was
not
issued
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
--
by
a
committee
there.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
that's
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
that's
right.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
that's
what
it's
for.
now,
on
the
section
95.03
of
the
florida
statutes
of
1957
and
also
1959,
which
have
just
been
issued,
any
clause
in
a
contract
as
affecting
a
reduction
in
the
florida
statute
of
limitations
is
invalid
and
shall
not
be
recognized
by
any
court
within
the
state.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
no,
sir.
the
statute
was
originally
passed
in
1913.
what
i
refer
here,
the
section
95.03
of
the
florida
statutes
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
--
in
1957.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
and
then
it
was
reconfirmed
by
the
legislature
so
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
--
and
the
statute
is
1959.
this
case
based
upon
the
florida
statute
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida.
following
an
effort
to
dismiss
the
case
and
also
following
a
motion
of
the
summary
judgment
which
was
denied
by
the
district
court,
the
case
was
tried
and
judgment
was
added
for
the
petition.
following
that,
various
motions
were
made
and
denied
by
the
district
court
and
it
was
appealed
to
this
circuit
court
for
the
second
--
second
circuit.
there,
at
the
argument
before
the
court
by
2
to
1
decision,
this
district
court
was
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
by
recognizing
the
florida's
--
the
florida
statute
and
the
fact
that
the
--
the
suit
clause
in
the
contract
was
a
property
right
that
the
insurance
company
had
been
denied
the
due
process
--
had
been
denied
due
process.
the
state
of
florida,
since
a
statute
of
the
state
had
been,
we
might
say,
to
a
certain
extent
or
declared
unconstitutional,
has
been
contrary
to
the
due
process
clause
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
then
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
as
amicus
curiae,
but
the
rehearing
was
denied
and
the
matter
came
to
this
court
on
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
gentlemen,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
find
only
one
case
absolutely
on
the
point
apparently
all
to
the
case
at
bar,
and
that
was
the
suit
in
the
state
of
alabama.
it
was
the
suit
of
galliher
versus
state
mutual
life
insurance
company,
150
ala.543,
43
so.833.
in
this
case,
in
alabama,
there
was
a
policy
written
in
georgia,
of
far,
a
resident
of
the
state
of
georgia.
the
resident
state
of
georgia
subsequently
moved
to
the
state
of
alabama
and
there
died.
there
were
certain
reasons
why
no
suit
was
prosecuted
within
the
12-month
limit
and
the
state
of
alabama
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
alabama
took
the
position
that
the
state
of
alabama
had
sufficient
interest
in
the
--
in
the
suit
so
that
the
statute
of
alabama,
which
is
parallel
to
that
of
florida
and
is
quoted
as
the
alabama
code
of
1896,
section
2802,
so
that
the
--
the
laws
of
alabama
would
control
rather
than
the
laws
to
the
state
of
georgia.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
state
of
florida
had
a
final
interest
and
such
an
interest
in
this
matter
to
where
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida
should
control,
rather
than
the
laws
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
policy
while
written
in
the
state
of
illinois,
within
two
months,
became
the
property
of
the
resident
of
the
state
of
--
of
florida.
all
the
property
was
in
the
state
of
florida.
the
loss
took
place
in
the
state
of
florida.
the
respondent
was
qualified
to
transact
business
within
the
state
of
florida.
the
investigation
by
the
insurance
people
was
made
within
the
state
of
florida
and
the
denial
of
--
of
the
claim
was
made
within
the
state
of
florida.
now,
the
respondent
had
claimed
that
the
only
thing
that
--
the
only
interest
that
the
state
of
florida
had
in
this
--
there
was
the
payment
of
the
loss,
if
the
loss
had
been
paid.
certainly,
if
a
resident
of
the
state
of
florida
--
if
the
policy
had
been
purchased
in
florida,
it
could've
had
no
more
interest
than
they
have
under
this
policy.
and
under
the
public
policy
of
the
state,
which
is
definitely
set
out
in
section
95.03,
florida
has
a
right
to
protect
a
citizen
of
the
state
against
a
clause
in
any
policy
where
--
that
maybe
written,
which
is
prohibited
within
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes,
sir.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
no,
sir.
but
the
state
of
alabama
has
decided
it.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
the
state
of
florida
has
said
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
--
our
laws
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
the
state
of
florida
has
said
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
--
in
our
laws
apply
to
insurance
contracts
within
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
they
haven't
said
so
that
they
did.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
they
haven't
said
that
the
contract
did
this.
now,
it's
been
definitely
decided.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
i
don't
see
how
they
could,
sir.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
[laughs]
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
--
that
the
general
law,
i
think,
is
clear.
and
where
the
state
has
sufficient
interest
in
the
--
in
the
contract
and
in
the
enforcement
of
the
contract,
that
the
law
of
the
forum
will
control.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
if
this
court
decided
in
a
case
which
was
cited
by
the
district
court,
delta
&
pine
land
case,
which
the
district
court
assumed
was
a
similar
case
when
it
was
not.
the
delta
&
pine
land
case
dealt
with
a
surety
bond.
the
surety
bond
required
that
a
suit
must
be
brought
at
--
no,
that
--
that
notice
of
defalcation
should
be
given
within
15
months
after
the
expiration
of
the
suretyship.
it
said
nothing
about
the
date
for
a
suit
to
be
started.
now,
it
did
have
a
12-month
clause
after
the
notice
was
given.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
no,
sir.
but
we
do
know
this
that
the
--
that
the
delta
&
pine
land
case
did
not
involve
a
--
a
suit
clause.
it
involved
a
notice
that
--
that
a
defalcation
had
taken
place.
and
that
was
not
given
until
many
months
after
the
--the
surety
had
ceased
to
exist.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
well,
sir
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
i
think
though
that
there's
great
deal
of
difference
between
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
--
changing
of
contract
to
that
sort
and
changing
one
where
it's
a
matter
of
public
policy
that
the
suit
must
follow
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
now,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute
of
limitations
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
unless
the
statute
of
limitations
say
that
it
--
that
a
--
a
person
can
sue
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
on
an
act
--
under
a
contract
in
the
various
statutes
of
limitations.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
that's
true,
sir.
but
at
the
same
i
don't
--
i
--
i
differentiate
between
that
and
the
--
the
suit
clause
in
this
policy.
i
think
the
state
of
florida
has
sufficient
interest
in
the
--
in
this
manner
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
--
to
where
its
interest
calls
upon
the
state
of
florida
and
allows
the
state
of
florida
to
assert
its
public
policy.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
i
was
going
to
take
the
time
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
--
mr.
justice,
to
--
on
rebuttal,
but
if
i
want
to
have
three
minutes,
i
probably
won't.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
yes.
