mr.

at
the
--
on
your
recital
of
the
facts
up
to
the
present
time
his
arrangements
were
--
were
made
before
he
pleaded
in
either
the
southern
district
or
the
eastern
district
of

but
mr.

i'm
going
to
give
you
five
minutes
to
respond
if

to

chief
justice

mr.
gilinsky
may
ask
you
if
suppose
he
had
attacked
the
20-year
sentence
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
would
the
case
be
in
the
same
posture?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
he
attacks
the
--the
maryland,
the
20-year
sentence
would
he
be
--
would
the
case
be
in
the
same
posture
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
take
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
take
this
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
i
don't
want
to
go
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
this.
let's
take
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
would
it
change
the
posture
of
it
if
he
was
here
attacking
the
--
the
maryland
sentence
instead
of
the
eastern
or
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
--
you
say
it
could?
what
is
the
distinct
--
what
would
be
the
distinction
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
proposing
this
case.
i'm
not
proposing
any
other
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
i
want
to
know
is,
if
he
was
here
in
this
proceeding,
challenging
the
maryland
conviction
of
20
years,
would
you
be
here
defending
it
as
though
that
case
was
in
the
same
posture
as
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
suppose
it
was
in
the
same
posture
as
this
one
is,
at
present
time
what
remedy
would
he
have
if
this
remedy
is
not
available
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
maryland
on
the
maryland
case
but
not
on
the
other
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
continue.

justice
earl
warren

behalf
of
the

i
should
like
to
thank
you
for
accepting
this
assignment
to

indigent
defendant
without

what
an
inconvenience
it
is

of
this
kind
and
we're

the
fact
that
the
lawyers
will
do
that.
