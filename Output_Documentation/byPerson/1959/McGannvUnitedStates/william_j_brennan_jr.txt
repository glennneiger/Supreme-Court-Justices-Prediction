justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
i
don't
think
i
get
it
clearly,
what
it
is
in
the
way
of
interference
with
the
baltimore
sentence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
all
that
--
and
that
there
was
only
one
offense
for
which
it
was
a
maximum
of
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
quite
understand
what
it
is
that
the
southern
and
eastern
district
assistants
were
supposed
to
promise
in
way
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
non
interference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meaning
then,
does
that
mean
this
that
he
would
get
a
sentence,
not
in
excess
of
five
years
so
that
if
he
prevailed
on
his
contentions
in
baltimore,
he'd
then
have
only
five
years
to
go.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis
may
i
ask
you
again
just
to
be
sure
i'm
clear
about
this.
in
affect
that
this
is
a
contention
on
the
merits
that
he
could
not
have
been
sentenced
in
baltimore
for
longer
period
than
five
years
â€“-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
he
was
induced
to
plead
in
the
southern
district
and
in
the
eastern
district
on
promises
which
were
in
affect
that
if
he
did
plea,
he
would
get
sentences
of
not
more
than
five
years
from
each.
so
that
if
he
then
prevails
in
his
contention
as
to
the
baltimore
sentences
he'd
not
to
serve
longer
than
five
years,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
has
he's
asking
for
is
he
is
telling
us
is
an
opportunity
to
establish
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
these
were
the
assurances
made
to
him
by
the
assistants
in
the
southern
and
in
the
eastern
district?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
this
should
happen
and
he
would
prevail,
that
the
sentences
there
would
be
set
aside
and
what
then
would
be
done
whether
it
would
be
a
resentence
or
correction
of
sentence
or
a
new
trial
or
what
as
the
case
maybe,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
has
to,
does
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
amounting
to
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
did
he
tell
you,
it
s
now
pending?
