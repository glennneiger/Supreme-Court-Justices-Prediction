justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
it
comes
with
new
york,
the
20
years
time.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
say
the
court
deal
he
assumed
there
was
to
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
is
that
he
was
to
be
given
a
lenient
sentence,
that's
what
the
deal
amounted
to?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
the
sentence
he
got
in
the
case
you
complain
about
was
12
years,
wasn't
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
run
concurrently
with
two
other
sentences
each
for
20
years,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
where
the
new
york
sentence
was
also
concurrent
to
this,
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
my
question
to
you
now
is
didn't
he
get
a
pretty
lenient
treatment,
he
didn't
get
an
additional
day
in
jail,
did
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
in
custody
but
in
custody
under
the
sentence
he
challenged.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
what
you
mean?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
this
question
mr.
davis?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
hearing
was
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
the
court,
the
sentencing
court
was
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
now
he
claims
there
that
that
sentence
was
illegal
because
of
its
relation
to
the
maryland
sentence
which
you
said
was
illegal.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
what
his
--
his
action
claiming
of
--
his
claim
of
illegality
of
the
12-year
sentence
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
of
new
york
was
based
upon
on
what
he
says
was
some
overreaching
or
invalidity
of
the
maryland
sentence.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
doesn't
it
do
with
this
and
this
is
point
i
was
to
trying
to
get
around
to,
does
it
not
in
your
view
bear
upon
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
(inaudible)
of
the
legality
of
the
maryland
sentence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then
isn't
that
the
end
of
your
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
right,
but
i'm
asking
you
how
the
eastern
district
can
determine
that
in
the
2255
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gilinsky
is
this
in
answer
if
there
is
a
one
20-year
sentence
is
here
against
this
man
rendered
in
maryland
and
he
sought
relief
under
2255,
could
the
government
defend
against
that
motion
upon
the
ground
that
there
is
another
and
subsequent
20-year
sentence
in
new
york?
doesn't
the
answer
have
to
be
no?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
no,
no.
not
on
site
it
because
it's
a
matter
or
law,
you'd
have
to.
you
couldn't
use
it
because
if
that
were
so
then
you
could
have
a
half
dozen
sentences
all
void
but
unable
to
attack
anyone
of
them,
isn't
that
so?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
rule
that
we
announced
or
in
the
heplin
case
simply
that
one
must
be
in
a
--
must
be
in
custody
under
the
sentence
and
that
he
seeks
to
challenge
and
if
he
is
then
he
can
challenge
it
under
the
2255
here.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
don't.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
if
you
could
read
what
section
2255
contemplate
the
existence
of
what
was
in
(inaudible)
to
contemplate
more
than
he
wanted?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
mean
the
right
to
prove
his
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
that
mean
from
the
second
term?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
that
point
will
have
to
tell
us
to
reach
in
with
the
position
by
2255
was
to
(inaudible)
and
some
may
(inaudible)
want
to
do
this
and
another
who
with
this
one
do
this
that
the
motion
in
that
petition
can
only
be
made
in
the
question
of
importance.
however,
they
never
enacted
the
status
of
the
man
who's
taken
to
his
freedom
as
to
think
he's
from
relief
unless
he
can
show
that
all
(inaudible)
court
to
do
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
therefore,
i
want
to
(inaudible)
you
to
reading
that
2255
language
contemplates
that
as
through
this
sentence
and
that
all
he
has
control
and
further
control
is
a
(inaudible)
under
the
section's
challenging
that
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
should
have
said
one
jurisdiction
in
sentence
one
to
six.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
habeas
corpus
just
implied
some
of
the
rules.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
except
he
will
have
a
right
to
be
heard.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
what
determines
(inaudible)
it
has
to
read
and
to
provide
the
object,
time
and
other
qualities
and
prior
to
this
in
use
of
this
in
the
opposite
to
take
over
this
section.
that
23
(c)
talks
of
the
time
the
fact
it
was
lain
that
is
now
come
to
differentiate
this
with
the
entire
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
had
come
in
when
you
do
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
davis
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
issue
of
fact
as
distinguished
from
one
of
law
is
tendered
by
the
motion
that
requires
a
hearing,
in
a
few
words,
please?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
doesn't
allege
that
it
was
any
statement
that
the
sentence
would
be
under
five
years,
does
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
a
conclusion,
isn't
it?
does
that
tender
an
issue
of
fact
on
which
evidence
is
needed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
promise
is
unless
on
who
bothers
that
conclusion
(inaudible)
and
that's
the
only
promise
as
alleged
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
though
the
promise
is
kept.
