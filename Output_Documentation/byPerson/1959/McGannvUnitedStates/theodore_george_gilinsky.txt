mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
first
issue
which
is
whether
the
collateral
attack
remedy
under
2255
is
applicable
in
this
situation
is
the
primary
issue
in
this
case
and
that
we
never
really
arrived
at
the
question
of
whether
the
second
issue
which
is
whether
or
not
in
the
context
of
all
the
problems,
this
petitioner
has
alleged
sufficient
facts
to
warrant
a
hearing.
now
briefly,
insofar
as
the
factual
picture
is
concerned,
counsel
has
outlined
it.
we'd
like
to
say
this.
we
feel
that
not
only
because
of
the
statute,
the
2255,
we
think
that
this
goes
even
much
further
than
the
statute.
we
say
this,
that
if
a
petitioner
has
a
20-year
sentence
in
maryland
to
serve
and
a
concurrent
sentence
of
20
years
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
serve,
that
under
any
circumstance
and
regardless
of
what
the
claim
is
or
regardless
of
how
it
arrived,
this
court
nor
any
other
court
should
on
collateral
attack
listen
to
a
contention
which
will
only
involve
the
12-year
sentence.
and
the
reason
we
say
this
is
because
in
a
long
line
of
cases
this
court
as
well
as
many
courts
of
appeal
on
direct
attack,
not
collateral
but
in
direct
review
of
sentences
have
many
times
held
in
multiple
count
cases
when
you
get
20
or
30
counts
that
once
this
court,
once
this
court
has
found
that
the
conviction
let's
say
of
20
years
is
supported
by
one
good
count,
this
court
will
not
go
into
the
multiple
problems
involved
in
the
numerous
other
counts
of
an
indictment
in
which
a
petitioner
either
is
a
general
sentence
or
concurrent
sentence.
now
we
think
that
this
situation
is
analogous
here.
in
other
words,
instead
of
the
possibly
unique
problem
of
having
a
person
sentenced
in
three
different
districts,
this
petitioner
had
received
all
of
his
sentences
in
one
district
such
as
maryland,
he
would
have
received
concurrent
sentences.
he'd
be
under
the
same
condition
he
is
now.
in
that
proceeding,
this
court
nor
that
court
nor
any
court
of
appeals
that
we
have
found
would
consider
on
collateral
attack,
would
never
consider
solely
the
12-year
sentence
which
this
petitioner
is
contesting
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
your
honors.
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
done
that
and
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
that
has
been
through
the
courts
of
appeal,
then
that
is
--
he
was
answered
that
by
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
my
answer
is
two-fold,
your
honor.
number
one,
we
--
imagine
a
case
in
other
words
where
a
petitioner
is
to
be
denied
relief
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
in
any
case
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i'm
--
i
mean
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
am
going
to
take
a
case
–
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
it
could
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
but
i
do
not
think
it
does.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
could
in
this
sense
that
the
maryland
court,
20-year
sentence
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
matter
of
fact
hear
--
that
has
heard
the
maryland
sentences
has
never
denied
this
petitioner
relief
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
has
concurrent
sentences
in
new
york.
but
it
could
i
suppose
under
a
strict
reading
of
the
statute
that
if
it
could
say
of
that
you
cannot
get
relief
in
this
court
because
you
have
two
other
or
you
have
other
concurrent
sentences.
if
we
have
that
problem
then
we
think
and
--
and
that
is
a
possibility,
then
we
think
that
the
statute
2255
provides
another
remedy.
if
the
court
will
--
we
have
set
forth
the
statute
on
page
2
and
3
of
our
brief
in
the
--
on
page
3
the
last
paragraph
of
the
motion
remedy
provides
that
when
the
motion,
when
the
motion
is
inadequate
or
ineffective
to
test
the
legality
of
his
detention
which
i
am
assuming
is
the
case
that
you
are
posing,
then
he
could
have
a
--
a
process.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
i
suppose
i
would,
i've
never
had
this
--
we've
never
had
this
situation
but
i
think
with
strict
reading
i
would
have
to
be
here
in
the
same
context.
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
would
not
have
a
remedy.
i
would
merely
then
say
that
he
does
not
have
a
remedy
by
motion.
i
do
not
mean
and
i
--
i
think
this
is
important
to
understand.
i
--
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
in
if
it
--
if
the
petitioner
were
attacking
the
maryland
sentence
which
is
the
--
the
first
20-year
sentence,
that
i
would
stand
here
and
say
under
no
circumstances
should
he
be
heard
like
i
am
saying
about
the
new
york.
i
would
then
say
that
this
petitioner
should
then
if
he
is
been
denied
relief
in
maryland
which
--
which
he
has
by
the
way,
but
if
he
had
been
denied
relief
in
maryland
then
i
would
say
he
is
entitled
to
use
habeas
corpus
as
the
statute
provides
because
the
motion
remedy
is
ineffective
to
attack
his
sentences.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
would
have
habeas
corpus.
i
think
without
any
question
he
would
have
habeas
corpus.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
in
habeas
corpus
your
honor
all
--
you
--
you
see
in
habeas
corpus
which
would
be
brought
where
he
has
been
detained,
he
could
bring
all
of
the
convictions
into
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
into
the
case.
as
a
matter
fact
he
would
have
to
bring
all
the
convictions
into
the
case
because
traditionally
habeas
corpus
has
always
been
a
remedy
for
freedom
and
release
and
he
would
have
to
make
a
--
a
strong
case
but
he
couldn't
make
it
i
suppose.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
no.
well
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question,
sir.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
not
in
maryland.
no,
it
would
be
in
kansas
where
he's
--
he's
being
detained.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
we've
never
said
that,
that's
true.
we've
--
we've
never
opposed
any
relief
in
maryland
based
upon
any
sentence
in
new
york
or
in
either
of
the
other
new
york
sentences.
he
has
attacked
the
maryland
sentence
four
times
and
he's
been
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
--
it
is
not
technically,
it
does
not
technically
run
because
the
maryland
sentence
being
first
run
did
not
run
concurrent
could
not
run
concurrent
with
new
york,
with
either
new
york
sentence.
so
that
it
is
--
it's
an
impossibility
based
upon
a
technical
record
situation.
but
i
am
assuming
a
possibility
which
i
--
i
agree
is
remote
because
it
didn't
even
happen
here,
where
a
man
could
be
denied
by
someone
by
a
--
by
a
district
court
by
saying,
"well
you
have
other
concurrent
sentences"
and
i
say
if
that
case
should
arise
then
the
statute
does
provide
a
-
a
remedy.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
agree.
i
think
the
government
would
--
would
be
very
unpopular
if
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
i
--
i
agree
except
i
recognize
as
a
remote
possibility
even
though
the
government
may
not
urge,
even
though
the
government
may
not
urge
that
he
cannot
have
relief,
i
can
recognize
there
is
the
slim
possibility
that
somewhere
someone
would
deny
a
person
relief
in
which
case
we
say
then
the
statute
does
grant
this
man
an
alternative
and
i
think
it's
a
safe
bell,
a
safeguard.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
do
not
so
read
it,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
this
case
is
a
much
stronger
case
as
a
matter
of
fact
than
heplin
was.
i
think
this
man
is
in
custody,
but
i
say
this
is
a
stronger
case
because
while
i
can
imagine
certain
things
unrelated
to
the
statute
that
heplin
can
gain
by
attacking
his
sentence
which
was
consecutive,
i
cannot
and
we
have
--
we
have
in
our
brief
tried
to
exhaust
all
possibilities,
we
cannot
find
any
benefit
that
this
petitioner
can
gain
by
eliminating
a
12-year
sentence
which
is
running
concurrently
with
the
others
and
that's
why
i
say
this
is
even
a
stronger
position,
in
other
words
it
must
be
released
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
in
this
particular
case
that
this
petitioner
has
had
the
opportunity
to
attack
his
maryland
sentence
a
number
of
times
and
which
he
has
done
and
that
this
had
been
heard
both
in
maryland,
it
has
been
heard
numerous
times
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
certiorari
has
been
denied
here.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
had
been
heard
on
the
--
this
meritorious
problem
that
he
is
raising
in
maryland
about
double
jeopardy.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
that
has
been
heard.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
because
of
the
new
york
sentence
–-
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh
no
--
no,
that's
not
right.
let
me
make
it
clear.
the
very
first
time
he
raised
it
in
maryland,
the
very
first
time
he
raised
it
in
maryland,
and
this
argument
was
made
because
in
maryland
you
see
he
also
has
concurrence
sentences.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
in
other
words,
there
are
three
concurrence
sentences
also
in
maryland.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there's
a
dyer
act
which
he
has
never
contested.
there's
this
five-year
sentence
and
then
there's
the
20
and
the
first
time
he
made
the
argument
in
maryland,
the
judge
said
to
him,
“well,
unless
you
can
show
that
you're
going
to
get
released
here
in
maryland
because
you
have
--
you
even
haven't
finish
your
five
year
sentence
here.”
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
he
was
not
attacking
that
sentence
and
he
was
not
attacking
the
dyer
act,
but
subsequently,
he
has
raised
in
maryland
--
a
number
of
times
in
maryland
the
problem
of
the
duplication
as
he
would
call
of
offenses
here
to
which
he
had
pled
and
this
can
be
raised
both
there
and
then
subsequently
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
has
had
lawyers
appointed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
--
just
the
maryland
litigation,
he
has
had
a
total
five
of
lawyers
representing
him
at
various
stages
so
that
--
that
maryland
part
and
that
is
the
problem
by
the
way
which
is
also
here
again
pending
and
now
under
the
label
of
coram
mobis
that
it
is
exactly
the
same
thing
which
he
had
--
that's
pending
in
this
court,
a
petitioner's
pending
in
this
court,
but
he
had
previously
raised
the
same
thing
under
2255
and
certiorari.
how
long?
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
it
was
filed
i
believe,
it
was
filed
november
16,
1959.
we
filed
a
memorandum
in
that
case
because
we
do
not
think
it
was
properly
handled
below
on
another
unrelated
problem.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
was
first
sentenced
in
1954
of
august.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
has
served
the
two
five
year
sentences.u
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
in
here
--
and
in
that
context
though,
he
has
already
more
than
once
attacked
the
maryland
sentence.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct
without
any
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
and
that's
what
i
mean.
after
--
after
that
limitation
had
expired
so
that
he
has
had
a
meritorious
hearing
in
maryland
unrelated
to
any
concurrent
of
them
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
should
be
released.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
that
is
not
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
that
has
been
here
before
under
2255.
he
has
raised
the
same
thing
again
under
coram
nobis.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
certiorari
was
denied
twice
in
the
maryland
jurisdiction,
twice
previous
to
that
--
twice
in
the
maryland
jurisdiction.
it
has
been
denied
in
this
court
and
the
third
one
from
maryland
is
pending
here.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
which
have
been
reviewed
a
number
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
say
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right
correct.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
heplin
matter,
we
--
as
we
read
the
heplin
case,
this
--
part
of
the
statute
in
the
concurring
opinion
which
was
italicized
was
claiming
the
right
to
be
released.
and
we
think
this
is
a
more
just
wording
in
the
statute
because
of
the
background
of
this
statute.
this
statute
which
was
inaugurated
by
the
judicial
conference
because
of
the
problems
in
habeas
corpus
had
a
long
history
of
committee
reports
and
conference
reports.
now,
we
have
attached
part
of
this
to
our
brief
here.
the
whole
of
the
act
was
considered
in
united
states
versus
hayman.
so
for
our
purposes,
i
would
--
i'd
just
narrowly
considered
just
this
language.
at
the
very
first
hearing
of
the
committee,
this
is
before
it
got
to
the
judicial
context,
the
habeas
corpus
committee,
this
language
read
claiming
that
the
judgment
is
void,
claiming
that
the
judgment
is
void,
in
that
context,
this
particular
action
here
would
have
been
cognizable.
we
think
it
is
significant
that
before
it
was
even
submitted
to
the
judicial
conference,
before
that,
this
wording
was
deliberately
changed
to
the
wording
we
now
find
in
the
statute
namely
claiming
the
right
to
be
released.
now
we
think
it
is
clear
why
it
was
changed.
it
is
because
the
habeas
corpus
committee
and
the
judicial
conference
were
truly
concerned
with
the
habeas
corpus
problem.
habeas
corpus
has
traditionally
and
always
been
utilized
only
and
solely
when
a
person
can
claim
the
right
to
be
released.
and
this
was
one
of
the
problems,
for
example
in
mcnally
versus
hill
where
they
--
the
petitioner
claimed
the
--
some
parole
rights.
at
that
time,
this
court
went
into
the
problem
of
habeas
corpus
and
concluded
that
habeas
corpus
as
a
remedy
had
never
been
used,
had
never
been
used
anytime
other
than
when
a
person
can
claim
the
right
to
be
released.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
if
you
mean
does
it
contemplate
that
there
can
be
three
sentences
against
the
--
the
petitioner
in
this
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
could
be
read
that
way
except
for
two
things.
number
one,
the
statute
which
was
drawn
by
men
who
were
aware
of
the
problem
did
not
say
that.
number
two,
the
history
of
habeas
corpus
from
which
this
language
obviously
comes
has
never
been
so
interpreted.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
i
--
i
must
answer
no
for
this
reason.
taking
this
case
as
an
example
in
maryland,
in
maryland
alone,
this
petitioner
had
three
sentences
not
one,
three.
i
think
that
in
maryland
he
could
have
attack
from
the
very
beginning,
he
could
have
made
an
allegation
attacking
all
three
under
2255
so
that
--
i
cannot
say
that
this
contemplates
only
one
sentence.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
this
is
a
--
i
--
i
don't
believe
this
--
i
don't
believe
--
well,
first
of
all,
i
find
nothing
about
this,
so
i'm
--
there's
nothing
in
the
reports
about
this.
so
it's
purely
based
upon
the
experience
of
the
cases.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
habeas
corpus
would
--
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
where
the
jurisdictions
were
because
in
habeas
corpus
and
all
the
judgments
would
be
there.
of
course
to
result
in
habeas
corpus
i
should
say
would
be
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case
because
in
habeas
corpus
what
would
happen
is
the
court
would
look
at
the
sentences
and
say,
“well,
here
you
have
a
20-year
sentence
which
is
good
and
we
will
not
consider
the
rest.”
in
other
words,
as
a
matter
very
--
being
very
practical,
this
petitioner
would
be
treated
exactly
the
same
in
habeas
corpus
if
he
--
he
could
bring
that
action.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
he
would
have
a
right
to
be
heard
if
he
had
facts
outside
the
record.
the
maryland
problem
has
never
been
that
he
and
if
he
had
this
problem
in
maryland,
we
might
have
a
different
situation.
the
maryland
problem
has
never
been
facts
outside
the
record.
he's
never
denied
that
he
robbed
the
bank
or
any
of
these
problems
in
maryland.
the
problem
in
maryland
had
been
solely
a
--
a
legal
problem.
and
first
of
all,
he
raised
the
question
of
whether
it
was
this
air
force
bank.
he
raised
the
question
of
whether
it
was
an
insured
bank.
the
next
time
he
raised
the
question
which
is
now
he
talks
about
--
of
the
difference
between
the
territorial
jurisdiction
count
and
the
bank
robbery
count.
so
that
in
either
of
these
cases
you
see,
he
--
he
didn't
require
a
personal
hearing.
this
was
a
legal
problem.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
said
that
he
told
this
to
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
he
clearly
--
i
--
i
give
this
petitioner
more
credit
than
to
say
had
this
petitioner
here
delved
in
the
law
long
enough
to
recognize
that
he
--
he
is
not
going
to
attack
the
maryland
sentence
in
new
york
and
i
do
not
read
to
him
as
in
the
same
act.
i
think
he
understands
that
very
well.
i
don't
think
he
is
saying
that.
he
says
that
this
--
this
is
part
of
his
allegation
of
the
background
of
why
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
told
him
that
she
would
ask
for
a
light
sentence.
it
was
because
he
had
his
notion,
originally,
he
says
that
he
could
get
off
in
maryland.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
do
not
read
the
petition
that
way.
i
read
the
petition
that
he's
told
he
wants
to
be
heard
on
whether
or
not
this
assistant
told
him
that
she
would
give
--
she
would
ask
for
a
light
sentence.
and
that's
what
i
believe
sincerely
is
what
he
wants
to
be
heard
of.
if
he
wants
to
be
heard
on
something
outside
the
eastern
--
of
the
facts
outside
the
eastern
district
then
we
have
certainly
muddled
the
whole
2255
problem
because
that's
exactly
what
we
had
2255
to
avoid,
was
this
problem
of
getting
things
from
outside.
as
i
say
that
we
--
we
think
both
the
language,
the
background
of
this
statute
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
it
have
all
been
consistent
in
holding
that
in
these
circumstances
this
statute
is
not
applicable.
may
i
spend
a
few
moments
on
the
second
question
which
we
do
not
really
believe
is
reached,
the
question
is,
assume
we
have
only
a
12-year
sentence,
assume
that
is
the
only
one
so
that
we
don't
get
into
the
other
problems,
has
this
petitioner
raised
the
question
sufficiently
to
grant
him
a
hearing?
we
think
it
is
significant
that
of
the
two
facets
of
this
problem,
one
of
the
things
that
he
has
said
was
that
the
court
originally
denied
him
the
right
to
withdraw
his
plea
because
he
says
in
his
petition
that
he
knew
at
that
time
that
he
had
been,
as
he
used
the
word,
tricked,
tricked.
now
we
suggest
this
means
that
this
petitioner
knew
of
his
remedies.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
a
lawyer
at
that
time
which
he
has
never
said
anything
about.
he
was
warned
of
his
rights.
he
was
told
by
the
court
that
the
court
could
give
him
the
sentence.
he
--
two
days
after
this
sentence,
he
did
attack
the
southern
district
and
he
did
not
attack
the
eastern
district
at
all
so
that
he
--
here
is
a
man
who
knew
if
we
--
if
we
believe
his
allegations,
knew
of
something
which
he
says
is
wrong
and
has
deliberately
not
done
anything
about
it
and
we
suggest
that
it's
--
it's
clear
why
because
he
didn't
get
a
maximum
sentence.
he
got
only
a
concurrent
sentence.
he
got
a
problem
which
was
not
going
to
interfere
with
him
in
the
least.
now
we
think
that
is
the
part
at
least
of
the
problem
on
the
merit.
the
other
part
of
course
is
that
there
is
a
clear
record
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
showing
that
he
was
warned.
number
one,
showing
in
that
the
court
told
him
that
the
court
could
enter
the
sentence.
if
we
are
to
disregard
all
of
these
safeguards,
i
suppose
it's
true,
then.
it
is
not
just
because
he
had
an
attorney
as
we
would,
but
all
of
this
were
--
and
he
doesn't
challenge
this
by
the
way
in
the
petition.
he
doesn't
challenge
any
of
these
record
facts.
he
merely
says
that
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
said
that
she
would
ask
for
a
light
sentence
and
she
did
not.
it's
nowhere
alleged
that
she
promised
him
a
light
sentence,
but
--
that
she
would
ask
for
it.
as
a
result,
we
feel
first
in
summary
that
this
petitioner
is
entitled
to
no
relief
on
any
circumstances
regardless
of
the
statutory
problem
because
of
the
general
policy
of
not
deciding
this
type
of
problem
where
this
is
no
--
no
benefit
at
all
can
result
to
this
that
this
particular
statute
as
grafted
and
as
interpreted
and
for
its
purpose
is
not
applicable
to
this
type
of
problem.
and
that
finally,
on
the
merit,
he
has
not
really
alleged
sufficient
grounds
to
entitle
him
to
a
hearing.
