mr.
thomas
homer
davis
if
the
--
if
the
court
please,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
a
proceeding
under
section
2255
of
the
code.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
an
inmate
of
the
united
states
penitentiary
of
leavenworth,
kansas.
in
the
very
brief
statement
of
the
background
of
the
various
convictions
i
think
would
be
pertinent
at
the
outset
and
then
discuss
his
contentions
in
a
later
time.
in
1954,
the
petitioner
was
indicted
in
three
separate
indictments
in
the
district
of
maryland
and
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
all
three
of
the
indictments.
the
first
indictment
was
for
bank
robbery.
he
received
a
sentence
of
20
years.
the
second
indictment
was
under
the
dyer
act,
he
received
a
sentence
of
five
years
for
that
to
run
concurrently
with
the
20
year-sentence.
the
third
indictment
was
for
robbery
under
the
jurisdictional
--
jurisdiction
of
united
states.
he
received
a
five-year
sentence
for
that.
it
also
ran
concurrently
with
the
20-year
sentence.
so
in
effect
the
--
out
of
the
maryland
cases
he
received
a
total
of
20
years
imprisonment.
now,
he
was
also
indicted
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
in
1955
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
in
that
court
to
a
bank
robbery
indictment
and
received
a
sentence
of
20
years
there
which
ran
concurrently
with
the
sentence
that
he
previously
received
in
baltimore.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
about
two
years,
your
honor.
right
after,
at
the
same
time
he
was
under
indictment
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
for
the
robbery
of
a
veterans
administration
facility
at
that
point
and
he
subsequently
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
that
indictment
and
that
indictment
he,
under
that
he
received
a
12-year
sentence
to
run
concurrently
with
the
baltimore
sentence.
now
the
case
before
this
court
is
the
case
under
the
eastern
district
indictment.
the
other
two
indictments
in
baltimore
and
in
the
southern
district
are
incidentally
related
and
it's
our
contention
that
they
used
those
sentences
to
deny
this
man
relief
under
2255
and
they
will
be
brought
into
the
action
incidentally
in
that
respect.
now
leading
up
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that's
right,
and
eventually
the
question,
the
only
real
question
i
think
that
is
before
this
court
is
going
to
be
the
question
of
whether
or
not
under
2255
he
has
to
be
entitled
to
his
--
to
immediate
release
to
--
to
be
his
freedom.
now
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
well,
there
is
in
my
mind.
i
realize
that
i
am
against
the
--
the
proposition
in
this
court
under
the
hepman
case
that
there
is
a
concurring
opinion
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
which
in
effect
says
and
specifically
says
that
there
must
be
a
right
to
immediate
relief.
and
in
the
body
of
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
you
first
arrived
at
a
question
of
jurisdiction
and
it
was
noted
there
that
there
was
a
division
in
the
court
on
the
question
of,
in
that
case
whether
not
the
man
had
to
be
in
custody
or
not
to
take
advantage
of
2255.
and
it's
my
contention
that
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
the
argument
of
and
i
think
that's
the
whole
sole
question
really
before
this
court,
but
there
is
another
angle
to
this
case
which
would
--
i'd
like
to
dispose
of
and
that
is
the
question
that
the
government
contends
that
in
this
man's
motion
to
vacate,
he
doesn't
allege
enough
grounds
or
substantial
grounds
to
warrant
the
court
bringing
him
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
to
testify
in
his
behalf.
that
i
think
is
almost
--
takes
care
of
itself
on
the
record
and
i
think
the
court
can
read
the
motion
and
i
think
its
ample
but
i
would
like
to
set
out
briefly
the
steps
this
man
went
through
to
come
to
this
question
of
the
release
and
i
think
that's
the
main
thing
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
here.
now
in
the
first
instance,
mcgann
filed
a
motion
--
a
motion
to
vacate
and
set
aside
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
on
him
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
now,
his
contention
briefly
as
to
the
merits
of
his
contention
is
this.
he
contends
and
if
the
court
will
refer
to
page
24
of
the
record
that's
his
second
motion
to
vacate,
mcgann
contended
that
when
he
got
to
new
york
to
await
disposition
of
those
two
indictments
that
an
assistant
--
the
court
appointed
an
attorney
to
represent
him
in
the
southern
district
case,
he
contended
that
this
attorney
told
him
that
if
he
would
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
to
this
indictment
in
the
southern
district,
he
would
see
that
the
sentence
imposed
upon
him
was
lenient
or
that
the
sentence
would
not
interfere
with
his
rights
under
the
maryland
sentence.
now
the
government
in
their
brief
contends
that
since
the
20-year
sentence
in
the
district
of
maryland
was
in
existence
it
made
no
difference
about
the
20-year
sentence
in
the
southern
district
or
the
eastern
district,
but
they
overlooked
a
point
that
mcgann
raises
in
his
motions.
mcgann
has
a
contention
that
in
the
district
of
maryland
he
was
charged
with
robbery
of
this
bank.
he
was
also
charged
with
robbery
under
the
(inaudible)
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
he
says
that
those
constitute
one
offense.
he
says
that
he
couldn't
have
robbed
the
bank
and
also
because
this
happened
to
be
on
government
land,
he
committed
a
second
robbery
under
that
statute.
he
contends
that
the
government
should
have
elected
upon
which
indictment
to
charge
him.
when
they
didn't
elect,
then
when
he
entered
pleas
of
guilty,
the
plea
of
guilty
that
was
imposed
under
the
(inaudible)
act
of
only
five
years
is
the
only
good,
only
good
sentence.
now,
he
contends
in
his
motion
here
that
in
talking
to
this
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
the
southern
district
and
later
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
the
eastern
district
that
he
was
contending
that
only
the
five-year
sentence
in
maryland
was
good.
that
if
proceeding
he
then
had
on
file
were
validated
and
upheld,
he
had
completely
serve
the
five
years
and
the
20-year
sentence
wouldn't
be
in
existence
and
he
wouldn't
be
confronted
with
this
problem
of
having
a
20-year
sentence
in
existence
against
him.
now
he
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
the
new
york
is
a
20-year
and
the
southern
district.
he
carries
that
step
further
and
says
that
in
his
contentions
now
raised
on
this
motion
to
vacate
in
the
eastern
district
that
they
are
tied
in
with
the
situation
in
the
southern
district
and
so
tied
in
that
if
this
would
fall
the
sentence
in
the
eastern
district,
likewise
the
one
in
the
southern
district
would
fall.
now
i
--
i
realize
that
the
only
thing
before
this
court
is
the
eastern
district
sentence
and
you
can
anticipate
that
he
is
going
to
be
successful
in
any
other
actions.
but
this
thing
is
interwoven
and
the
only
reason
i'm
discussing
these
two
new
york
cases
is
to
show
the
court
what
his
contentions
are
at
this
point
as
to
whether
or
not
he
alleged
enough
to
warrant
that
court
to
produce
him
in
new
york
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
on
his
motion.
he
says
that
this
east
--
southern
district
assistant
united
states
attorney
made
this
deal
with
him
that
it
would
not
interfere
with
his
baltimore
and
maryland
sentences
and
that
it
was
for
five
years
he
was
contending
he
was
only
subject
to
a
sentence
under
baltimore.
now
he
says
that
he
went
to
new
york.
he
refused
to
enter
pleas
of
guilty
until
this
proposition
was
placed
before
to
him
by
mr.
lizzare
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district.
he
then
says
that
when
this
deal
was
made
lizzare
says
to
him,
"why
don't
you
make
the
same
arrangements
with
the
united
states
attorney's
office
in
the
eastern
district?"
so
mcgann
says,
"well
if
they
all
make
the
same
deal
in
that
district
i
--
i'll
do
it."
so
lizzare
says
i
will
get
in
touch
with
the
assistant
united
states
attorneys
to
the
eastern
district
and
they'll
come
down
here
and
they
did
come
down
and
the
record
shows
it.
they
came
down
there
the
next
day
and
he
contends
he
then
had
a
discussion
with
ms.
mccann,
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
from
the
eastern
district
and
she
was
accompanied
by
another
assistant
united
states
attorney.
he
says
that
they
made
this
same
deal
with
--
he
made
the
same
deal
with
her.
he
says
that
the
deal
was,
that
if
he
pled
guilty
they
would
see
that
he
got
a
lenient
sentence
and
coupled
with
that,
these
promises
throughout
is
the
contention
he
makes
that
it
would
not,
the
sentence
he
got
would
not
interfere
with
his
baltimore
sentence
and
that
in
that
connection,
he
explained
to
them
that
he
contended
he
was
only
subject
to
five
years
imprisonment
there.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
a
lenient
sentence
and
one
that
would
not
interfere
with
his
sentence
in
baltimore
and
maryland.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
to
run
concurrently
with
the
20-year
maryland
sentence
that
was
the
only
one
that's
mentioned.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that's
right,
in
effect
it
was
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
but
i
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
of
whether
he
was
--
was
a
given
a
lenient
sentence
or
not.
he
contends
in
this
motion
that
there
was
collusion
between
the
eastern
district
and
the
western
district
assistant
attorneys
that
he
was
sitting
there
in
new
york,
he
wasn't
going
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
he
didn't
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
he'd
never
admitted
his
guilt
and
he
says
there
was
collusion
between
the
two
districts
and
that
these
promises
were
made
to
get
him
to
enter
the
plea,
in
addition
he
also
contended
he
was
in
the
city
detention
house
in
new
york
and
he
wanted
out
of
there
because
he
didn't
like
it
and
that
was
another
reason.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
he
was
appointed
--
appointed
--
a
lawyer
was
appointed
named
oakman
in
the
southern
district
and
a
lawyer
named
grass
was
appointed
in
the
eastern
district
at
those
times.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
they
were
not
present
at
the
conferences
that
took
place
in
the
jail
when
ms.
mccann
and
the
other
assistant
united
states
attorney
from
the
eastern
district
came
down
to
the
jail
and
talked
to
him
and
made
these
arrangements
with
him
they
were
not
present.
his
attorney
was
not
present.
he
alleges
that
in
here.
now
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that
is
correct
your
honors.
they
were
made
prior
to
that.
in
fact,
the
record
shows
he
was
brought
before
those
courts
numerous
times
consistently
refused
to
enter
pleas
of
guilty
until
these
arrangements
were
made.
now
here
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
well
the
baltimore
sentence
your
honor
was
20
years
on
the
bank
robbery,
five
on
the
dyer
act,
five
on
this
sentence
of
robbery
because
this
place
--
the
bank
he
robbed
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
his
contention
is
there
that
they
were
all
to
run
concurrently,
the
two
five-year
sentences
with
the
20.
he
contends
that
he
was
not
really
subject,
he
--
the
two
different
offenses
of
robbery
just
like
under
the
national
--
national
bank
robbery.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
they
promised
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
he
--
he
was
up
there
and
he
--
he
would
not
plea
guilty
to
either
charge
and
they
brought
him
into
court
repeatedly
and
finally
he
contends
that
this
attorney
in
the
southern
district,
a
mr.
oakman
told
him,
came
to
him
and
said,
"now
why
don't
you
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
here
to
this
southern
district
case.
all
that
this
assistant
united
states
attorney
wants
is
this
is
a
bank
robbery
case,
he
wants
his
record
of
these
bank
robbery
cases.
they're
interested
in
--
in
getting
the
record
perfect
on
them.
he
says,
"he'll
make
you
a
deal"
and
the
deal
would
be
that
he
would
get
a
lenient
sentence
or
a
sentence
that
would
not
interfere
with
his
contention
that
he
only
had
five
years.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that's
what
--
that's
what
he
means
when
he
says
that
and
that's
what
he
has
to
mean.
that's
what
he
says.
now
briefly
what
happened
was
this.
he
filed
a
motion
to
vacate.
it
was
denied.
he
filed
a
motion
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
the
appeal
finally
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
second
circuit.
they
heard
the
case,
they
denied
it.
he
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
that
court
then
said
on
the
motion
of
pre-hearing,
it's
denied
but
without
prejudice
to
filing
a
second
motion
on
more
complete
grounds.
so
he
turns
around
and
he
files
a
second
motion
to
dismiss
and
that's
on
page
24,
and
it's
my
contention
without
counsel,
without
the
advise
of
counsel,
this
man
has
filed
this
document
which
is
about
six
--
five
pages
of
printed
of
record.
he
designates
the
first
page
jurisdictional
statements
like
(inaudible)
but
it
is
his
motion.
he
has
a
statement
of
the
case.
in
the
statement
of
the
case
he
alleges
all
these
things
i've
been
talking
about.
so
it's
my
contention
that
his
motion
contains
all
these
facts
of
questions
and
that
when
then
they
do,
under
2255
as
decided
in
the
hayman
case,
he
should
have
been
produced
to
that
court
to
testify
in
support
of.
now
i
think
that's
enough
on
that
--
the
court
--
it
will
be
obvious
to
the
court
by
reading
this
motion
and
i
think
the
government's
contention
is
without
merit.
for
instance,
one
thing
they
had
ms.
mccann
file
affidavits,
in
the
district
court
on
the
first
motion,
in
the
district
court
on
the
second
motion,
in
the
circuit
court
in
the
second
motion
and
she
sets
out
in
an
affidavit
denying
all
these
contentions.
she
even
goes
to
the
point
and
she
says
she's
talked
to
mr.
lizzare,
the
assistant
from
the
southern
district
and
she
says
he
would
testify
to
certain
things
in
an
affidavit.
they
are
ex
parte
affidavits.
then
they
say
that
the
court
in
denying
his
motions
didn't
consider
these
affidavits
but
they
overlooked
a
fact
in
that
connection
which
is
hard
for
me
to
understand.
they
say
the
court
didn't
consider
him
--
consider
her
affidavits
on
the
facts
of
questions
but
only
incidentally
in
case
the
court
arrived
at
a
conclusion
that
the
man
was
entitled
to
a
hearing.
now
how
can
you
consider
something
incidentally
as
a
matter
of
evidence,
is
something
that
i
don't
understand?
it's
either
considered
or
it
isn't
considered.
so
i
think
they
were
without
merit
on
that
point.
now
i
think
the
question
we
got
to
come
to
here
is
this
question
of
the
right
to
be
released.
the
court
is
well
of
course
familiar
with
the
hayman
case.
2255
was
enacted
and
when
it
was
enacted
under
the
simon
case,
the
only
question,
real
question
before
the
court
there,
was
the
question,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
have
been
produced
to
testify
on
his
own
behalf.
hayman
contended
that
an
attorney
appointed
for
him
represented
this
codefendant
without
his
knowledge.
the
district
court
conducted
a
three-day
hearing
took
evidence
and
denied
his
motion.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
when
they
came
to
consider
the
case
denied
it
on
the
ground
that
they
said
2255
was
unconstitutional.
that
it
was
a
suspension
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
this
court
when
they
reviewed
the
hayman,
they
said
that
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
2255
was
not
involved.
they
wouldn't
anticipate
it
and
it
was
not
decided.
now
same
on
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
pointed
out
in
the
footnotes
to
hayman
case
has
set
2255
is
constitutional.
the
constitutionality
of
2255
is
not
before
the
court
and
this
here
isn't
either,
but
i've
got
my
contentions
in
this
matter
are
these.
in
hayman
the
court
said,
"where
the
motion
shows
that
there
are
questions
not
shown
on
the
face
of
the
record"
that
the
petitioner
should
be
produced
or
could
--
there
ought
to
be
produced
in
the
court
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
the
law
should
be
made
and
he
should
be
brought
to
the
court.
now,
we
come
to
the
next
case
that
this
court's
passed
on
in
this
section
and
that
is
the
heplin
case.
and
in
the
heplin
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
--
argued
in
january
14th
of
1959
that
the
court
here
had
was
confronted
with
is
situation.
hayman
or
heplin
complained
that
he
was
charged
under
the
bank
robbery
statutes
and
that
the
sentence
imposed
--
there
were
three
charges
and
one
was
a
conspiracy
charge,
it
was
tagged
on
to
bottom
of
the
sentence
and
made
to
run
in
the
second
plea.
the
court
was
considering
in
the
--
in
the
heplin
case
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
man
had
to
be
in
custody
at
the
time
he
took
advantage
and
tried
to
take
advantage
of
2255.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
well
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
yes
i
mean
that.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
yes.
and
in
other
words
you
held
it
because
of
the
consecutive
nature
of
the
sentences.
he
couldn't
be
or
make
the
2255
was
not
available.
that
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court.
now,
the
court
said
in
that
case
we
have
a
jurisdictional
problem,
justice
--
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
his
opinion,
we
have
a
jurisdictional
problem
we
have
to
dispose
of
first
and
that
is
touched
on
very
briefly
in
the
opinion
and
he
further
stated
the
court's
divided.
now
to
me
i
read
the
concurring
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
see
the
names
of
the
justices
decided
in
that
concurring
opinion
which
means
that
to
me,
that
the
minority
on
this
question
was
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
warren,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
brennan
and
the
majority
were
those
names
in
the
concurrent
opinion.
now
in
this
concurrent
opinion,
mr.
justice
porter,
he
goes
on
and
specifically
discusses
the
question
that
under
2255
you
must
--
the
prisoner
must
be
claiming
the
right
to
be
released.
what
my
argument
to
this
court
is
that
it
seems
to
me
in
the
hayman
case
and
in
this
case,
this
court
is
saying
in
substance
that
this
new
motion
2255,
is
nothing
more
than
a
substitute
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
you
are
applying
but
mcnally
verus
hill
decision
in
--
under
habeas
corpus
which
there
must
be
an
immediate
right
to
be
released.
2255
to
me
has
several
different
parts
to
it.
the
first
is
that
the
man
must
claim
the
right
to
be
released
upon
the
ground
that
sentence
was
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
of
the
laws
of
united
states
or,
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
impose
the
sentence
or
that
the
sentence
was
in
excess
of
the
maximum
authorized
by
law.
and
then
this
very
general
ground,
or
that
it
is
subject
to
collateral
attack,
the
court
may
move
to
do
what?
the
court
may
move
to
vacate,
to
set
aside
--
yes
to
vacate,
to
set
aside
or
correct.
now,
if
you
hold
that
you
got
to
--
a
man
has
the
--
he
--
have
the
right
to
be
released,
why
do
you
bring
him
up
on
2255
like
under
the
--
you
did
in
the
prince
case
or
in
this
bank
act
he
is
not
going
to
be
released
if
you
bring
him
up
to
the
court
and
say,
"the
sentence
you
gave
him
under
bank
robbery
encompassed
all
the
acts
he
did
and
these
other
terms
you
got
down
below
where
you
charged
him
with
taking
a
hostage
and
so
forth
he
is
under
that
you
reduce
--
you
hold
that
part
of
the
sentence
is
excessive,
that
man
is
not
released.
he's
--
he
is
under
this
action,
he
doesn't
have
when
he
files
it,
he
doesn't
have,
he
can't
claim
the
right
to
be
released
because
he
isn't
going
to
be
released.
his
(inaudible)
is
going
to
be
corrected.
now
in
this
heplin
case
you
come
to
rule
35
in
the
discussion
and
you
say
that
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
rule
35.
well
rule
35
under
these
proceedings
there
has
to
be
shown
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
the
sentence
is
illegal
and
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
and
there
are
no
cases
that
i
have
found
that
holds
no
decisions
that
anything
they
hold
in
the
record
can
be
considered
under
35.
so
i
come
to
the
question
why
did
they
pass
2255?
if
they
pass
it
solely
to
be
a
substitute
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
then
i
say,
it
is
--
it's
unconstitutional
because
i
don't
think
you
can
pass
the
legislation
to
take
and
substitute
for
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now
another
thing
in
2255
the
act
goes
on
and
it
says
this,
it
says
that
the
court
can
set
aside
the
judgment
and
shall
discharge
the
prisoner
or
resentence
him
or
grant
a
new
trial.
now,
have
they
passed
a
new
legislation
that's
much
broader
than
we
think,
they
have
passed?
if
they
can
grab
a
new
trial
under
2255,
do
you
have
to
say
that
that
means
they
can
only
grant
a
new
trial
when
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated?
if
his
be
--
if
he's
granted
a
new
trial
under
this
section
and
i
find
no
cases
on
that
and
i
don't
see
where
they've
done
it,
if
he
is
give
the
right
to
a
new
trial,
how
can
you
say
that
he
is
--
must
have
a
right,
a
claim
to
be
released.
i
think
that
this
2255
is
so
much
broader.
now
in
hayman
they
say
it's
as
broad
as
habeas
corpus
and
habeas
corpus
--
it
was
passed
to
give
the
same
rights.
they
say
it's
broader
than
coram
nobis,
but
then
in
hayman
they
also
say,
"it's
an
independent
action"
that
this
court
has
said
that.
this
court
says
that
it's
an
independent
and
collateral
inquiring
to
the
validity
of
the
conviction.
so
i
think
that
if
this
court
has
to
interpret
2255
to
be
a
substitute
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
this
can
be
done
because
the
constitutionality
is
not
involved.
but
i
personally
have
never
thought
2255
was
constitutional
for
a
lot
of
reasons,
but
one
is
that
you
put
a
different
standard
on
a
prisoner,
a
man
serving
a
federal
sentence,
he
is
put
under
a
different
situation
than
any
other
american
citizen.
he's
got
to
take
all
these
procedural
steps
before
he
can
have
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
brought
to
bear
on
is
case
and
soon
as
it's
--
that's
another
reason
that's
not
involved
here.
i
think
that
this
statute
has
enacted
a
law
that
is
much
broader.
now
you
take
one
bite
out
of
it.
you
say
first
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
if
he
alleges
facts
that
are
outside
the
record
that
there
are
facts
so
you
need
his
testimony
on.
the
next
bite
you
take
in
heplin
is
you
say,
"he
must
be
in
custody"
so
now
you've
got
to
take
the
third
bite
and
you've
got
to
come
along
and
you
say,
"he
must
establish
his
right
to
be
released
the
same
as
you
do
under
mcnally
versus
hill.
yet,
how
are
you
going
to
make
this
the
--
the
statute
indivisible?
you're
going
to
say,
the
statute
says
this,
that
when
you
file
the
action
to
that
court
if
there
effects
that
warrant
the
court
looking
into
it,
the
court
shall
determine
the
issues.
not
that
you
should
determine
the
issues
at
--
you
have
a
hearing,
a
judicial
hearing
it
says.
and
at
that
judicial
hearing
that's
when
the
court
determines
issues.
now
if
you're
going
to
interpret
the
statute
that
the
court
must
look
at
this
and
see
whether
he
is
correcting
the
sentence
whether
he
is
going
to
vacate
it,
whether
he
is
claiming
the
same
thing
he
does
under
habeas
corpus
instead
of
solving
anything
or
simplifying
anything
it
looks
to
me
like
you
are
making
this
more
cumbersome
and
more
burdensome
than
you
have
under
habeas
corpus.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
well
he
--
the
maryland
sentence
and
the
southern
district
he
is
claiming
because
of
the
collusion
between
the
united
states
attorneys
that
it's
illegal,
yes.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
well
he
--
he
would
have
to
garner
he
would
have
to
prove
and
contend
that
the
maryland
sentence
was
only
good
for
five
years
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
--
and
he
would
have
to
file
an
action.
he
does
have
a
miscellaneous
action
in
this
court
of
petition
for
certiorari
about
that.
but
i
realize
until
he
sets
that
aside
in
an
appropriate
action
he's
still
under
the
20-year
sentence.
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
has
--
he
can
file
this
motion
in
the
--
in
the
eastern
district
(inaudible)
–-
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
i
don't
think
they
can
do
it.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
no
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
think
the
question
here
is
it
isn't
--
it's
a
question
whether
or
not
the
pleas
that
this
man
made
were
induced,
were
induced
by
the
collusion
and
the
promises
of
the
two
assistant
united
states
attorneys.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
well
because
a
part
of
the
promises
were
made
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
the
eastern
district
case
in
conjunction
with
the
one
in
the
southern
district.
now
i
realize
that
if
this
court
--
what
it
said
is
and
--
and
decide
this
in
favor
then
nothing
could
be
done
except
this
man
would
go
back
to
the
eastern
district
where
he
would
have
a
chance
to
present
his
testimony
to
testify
and
there
be
conclusions
of
fact,
findings
of
law
and
conclusions
of
fact,
and
that's
what
we're
confronted
with
in
this.
you
go
to
the
circuit
court
and
you
come
to
this
court
and
you
have
no
findings
of
fact,
no
conclusions
of
law
and
you
have
to
assume
all
these
things
and
anybody's
assumption
is
as
good
as
the
other.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
well
–-
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
if
the
court
will
look
at
page
27
of
the
record
which
is
his
second
motion,
one
of
the
things
he
states
right
there,
it
wouldn't
is
this,
“wouldn't
interfere
of
my
chances
of
release
in
the
maryland
case,
which
would
mean
a
sentence
not
exceeding
five
years.”
that's
right
in
his
second
motion.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that
is
correct.
he
wants
a
chance
to
be
present
there.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
that
would
be
of
the
course
immaterial
at
this
hearing
what
would
happen
back
there.
he'd
have
a
chance
his
day
in
court.
he'd
have
a
chance
to
--
to
testify,
to
be
present
in
person
to
testify
--
i
think
my
time
--
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
if
the
court,
please,
briefly
one
thing
the
government
contends
is,
this
man
has
not
taken
advantage
of
all
his
rights
as
a
good
lawyer
would
do.
you
must
remember
this
man's
in
the
leavenworth
penitentiary,
he
is
a
colored
man.
he
has
no
right
to
take
the
law
but
to
himself.
he
reads
these
books
in
the
library
so
many
hours
in
evening
and
he
has
educated
himself
through
all
these
proceedings
and
it
(inaudible)
who's
in
the
government
in
my
opinion
to
hold
him
to
strict
lines
of
procedural
matters.
he
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
--
of
some
leniency
here,
like
the
courts
to
give
him
a
habeas
corpus.
now,
this
question
of
this
statute
sees
him
claiming
the
right
to
be
released.
this
statute
--
the
court
is
applying
habeas
corpus
under
mcnally
verse
hill
that
you
must
show
the
right
to
be
released.
this
just
says
claiming
a
right
to
be
released.
suppose
he
puts
in
his
motion
to
vacate
and
he
says
i
claim
the
right
to
be
released
for
these
grounds,
suppose
that
he
doesn't
have
and
can't
show
that
he
is
entitled
to
release.
this
statute
says
that
a
hearing
should
be
had.
and
this
statute
then
says
that
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
should
be
made
and
then
when
you
come
up
through
your
circuit
and
through
your
district
court
or
some
court
has
made
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
now
in
the
government's
brief,
they
say
he'd
be
entitled
to
no
relief
on
parole,
on
good
time.
well,
who's
deciding
all
these
things
whether
he's
entitled
to
any
of
these
things
because
the
man
has
never
had
a
hearing.
does
the
court
when
it
gets
one
of
these
motions
have
to
go
through
the
record
write
to
united
states
attorney
and
say,
“now,
if
we
granted
this,
would
this
affect
this
man's
parole
rights
on
the
--
on
the
second
sentence?
would
it
affect
this
good
time
rights?
you're
having
a
hearing
without
the
man
being
present
because
you're
asking
the
court
to
make
all
these
decisions
and
there's
no
finding
of
fact,
no
conclusions
of
law,
no
hearing
as
this
statute
says
a
judicial
hearing.”
now,
in
the
concurring
opinion,
this
court
in
the
heplin
case,
the
court
says
that
they
don't
leave
the
majority
concurrent
opinion
that
this
question
hearing
at
anytime.
all
they
say
is
--
that
that
means
res
judicata
doesn't
apply
or
latches.
well,
if
the
congress
intended
that
that
was
what
they
meant,
why
didn't
they
say
it?
why
did
they
say
a
hearing?
why
do
they
use
the
word
hearing?
in
the
hayman
case,
the
court
says,
“this
is
purely
a
statute
to
afford
the
man
the
same
right
he
had
in
habeas
corpus.
in
another
section
of
the
hayman
case,
they
say,
“this
is
an
independent
action,
collateral
attack
on
the
judgment.”
so
if
it
is,
now
the
question
he
says
here
about
this
man
claiming
he's
--
he
has
denied
the
right
to
withdraw
his
motion,
his
plea
of
guilty.
he
went
in
to
the
eastern
district
court.
he
filed
the
motion
and
he
asked
to
withdraw
he
plea
of
guilty.
the
court
never
heard
a
word
of
testimony.
the
man
never
got
to
open
his
mouth.
it
was
denied
arbitrarily
from
the
bench
and
true
that
that
is
the
matter
ordinarily
you
have
to
raise
by
appeal
and
it's
the
discretion
--
that
is
the
court,
but
the
abuse
of
a
court
as
to
discretion
is
a
matter
you
can
reach
and
hear.
we
have
a
statute
that
says
--
2255
says
that
a
court
on
--
under
2255
can
grant
a
motion
for
new
trial.
but
what
does
it
mean
that
it
can
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial?
does
it
mean
that
the
old
theory
that
you
had
to
appeal
or
what
is
it
a
new
trial
granted?
why
--
why
do
you
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial?
you
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
if
something
has
occurred
at
the
trial
that's
irreversible
error.
you
also
can
like
you
do
in
habeas
corpus,
set
aside
that
he
wasn't
advised
his
rights
to
counsel,
but
how
broader
have
they
gone?
why
they
did
say
that
he'd
have,
the
court
under
2255
would
have
a
right
to
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial?
what
they
put
it
in
there
for?
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
yes.
well,
just
this
that
there
was
collusion
between
the
assistant
united
states
attorneys
through
the
southern
district
and
the
eastern
district.
this
man
was
in
new
york
in
jail.
he
wouldn't
plead
guilty.
they
kept
bringing
him
back
in
before
the
court.
so
he
alleges
--
they
--
they
got
together
and
by
collusion,
they
persuaded
him
that
if
he'd
plead
guilty,
they
would
give
him
a
lenient
sentence
--
recommend
a
lenient
sentence
and
the
sentence
in
effect
wouldn't
be
over
five
years
long
and
they
kept
working
at
him.
so
the
southern
district
attorney
comes
over
and
he
does
it.
then
the
southern
district
attorney
says,
“now,
i'll
get
the
girl
from
the
eastern
district
and
she'll
come
down
here
and
make
the
same
deal.”
she
did
come
down
but
he
says
we
made
the
deal.
now
on
2255,
he's
trying
to
get
the
court
there
to
hold
that
he
was
coerced
and
placed
under
duress
to
change
his
attitude
from
willingness
--
willingly
entering
pleas
of
guilty
by
these
promises
and
it
was
that
duress
and
coercion
and
collusion
of
those
two
assistant
united
states
attorneys,
that's
what
he
wants
to
go
back
to
that
court
and
have
a
hearing
on.
he
wants
to
get
back
there
and
get
on
the
witness
stand
and
testify
about
those
things
under
2255.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
he
doesn't
but
it's
--
it
--
it
follows
he's
got
it
in
his
motion
to
that
effect.
that's
what
he
meant.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
right.
if
you
--
if
you
allege
it,
two
assistant
of
united
states
attorneys
of
two
districts
persuade
you
to
change
your
mind
about
entering
a
plea
of
guilty
by
promises
made,
i
think
that
you've
got
a
question
of
fact
there
and
not
a
conclusion.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
what
difference
would
it
make
what
the
promise
was
if
by
any
kind
of
a
promise,
he
changed
his
mind
of
not
entering
a
plea
and
entered
a
plea?
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
fulfilled
or
not.
if
you
change
the
mind
of
a
man
who
says
i'm
not
guilty
and
you
get
him
to
change
his
mind
by
any
kind
of
a
promise
silly
or
otherwise,
you
have
used
duress
on
that
man
in
my
opinion.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
even
though
the
promise
is
kept,
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
my
opinion.
if
you
change
a
man,
who's
got
a
right
to
plead
not
guilty
and
if
you
induce
him
by
any
kind
of
a
threat,
promise
or
coercion
and
you
change
his
mind
and
he
does
something
he
didn't
intend
to
do
in
the
first
place,
you
have
violated
the
constitution
in
my
opinion.
i
thank
the
court
very
much
for
the
extra
time.
mr.
thomas
homer
davis
it
is
a
privilege
and
an
honor,
your
honor.
