mr.
harvey
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
in
this
matter,
arising
out
of
the
maritime
tort
was
brought
for
damages
for
wrongful
death
and
for
personal
injuries.
the
case
was
originally
started
on
the
civil
side
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
west
virginia,
but
was
transferred
on
motion
to
the
admiralty
side
over
objection
of
the
respondent,
i
might
add,
and
it
was
tried
before
the
judge
as
an
admiralty
suit.
the
case
involves
marvin
goett,
who
was
a
maritime
worker
employed
by
the
respondent,
amherst
barge
company.
that
company
had
a
marine
repair
yard
just
outside
of
charleston,
west
virginia.
the
vessel
that
was
involved
in
this
case
was
an
unpowered
and
unmanned
tank
barge,
which
was
owned
by
the
respondent,
union
carbide
and
which
was
turned
over
to
amherst
barge
for
painting,
sandblasting
and
for
minor
repairs.
the
words,
“minor
repairs”
are
actually
set
forth
in
the
contract
between
union
carbide
and
amherst
barge
and
in
addition
to
that,
in
answers
to
interrogatories
presented
by
union
carbide,
they
conceded
that
the
repairs
were
indeed
minor.
the
lawsuit
was
predicated
upon
carbide's
negligence
and
carbide's
failure
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel
to
mr.
goett.
there
was
at
no
time
any
violation
of
coast
guard
regulations
or
statutes
involved
in
the
suit.
the
barge
itself
was
turned
over
by
carbide
to
amherst
on
october
2nd
of
1956.
on
october
4th
or
october
3rd,
one
of
carbide's
men
came
aboard
the
vessel
to
inspect
the
vessel
and
to
discuss
the
work
which
had
to
be
done
and
at
that
time,
knew
or
must
have
known
of
the
conditions
which
existed
aboard
the
vessel
and
those
conditions
were
as
follows.
there
was
complete
absence
of
any
safety
or
lifesaving
equipment
aboard
the
vessel.
by
that
i
mean
there
were
no
lines,
no
mooring
lines,
no
life
jackets,
no
life
tools
itself,
no
rowboats
or
anything
of
that
nature
which
could
have
possibly
saved
the
man
if
he
did
in
fact
go
overboard.
goett
was
one
of
six
men
who
went
aboard
the
ship.
and
the
first
operation
to
set
the
ship
up
for
the
painting
operation
itself
was
to
sandblast
the
deck
of
the
vessel
and
that
of
course
is
equivalent
to
simply
chipping
the
paint
off
the
deck
so
that
it
can
be
painted
on
the
metal
itself.
nobody
knows
exactly
what
happened.
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
as
to
why
goett
did
fall
overboard,
but
the
fact
remains
that
one
of
the
men
suddenly
realized
that
goett
was
missing.
when
he
ran
over
to
where
he
last
saw
his
fellow
worker,
there
was
the
man
in
the
water
and
he
subsequently
did
drown
although
three
of
the
men
at
various
times
jumped
into
the
water
in
an
effort
to
save
him.
of
course,
because
of
the
complete
absence
or
lack
of
any
safety
equipment,
there
could
be
no
effort
made
to
save
goett
other
the
men
themselves
jumping
in
and
to
try
to
do
the
job.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
no,
sir.
that
was
simply
due
to
the
panic
of
the
man
himself
and
the
district
court
judge
accepted
it
as
such.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
he
could
not
swim.
the
findings
of
the
district
judge
were
as
follows.
number
one
that
it
was
foreseeable
to
carbide
that
men
would
go
aboard
the
vessel
to
do
the
work.
in
fact,
it
was
obviously
a
necessity
to
do
the
work.
that
there
was
the
duty
upon
carbide
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work,
and
that
it
was
negligent
for
carbide
not
to
equip
the
vessel
knowing
that
men
who
were
going
aboard
had
to
do
the
work
with
some
lifesaving
equipment,
that
the
barge
itself,
because
of
the
lack
of
that
equipment
was
not
seaworthy
at
the
time
of
goett's
death,
that
the
proximate
cause
of
his
death
was
that
lack
of
the
equipment
involved.
the
court
then
stated
that
the
barge
could
not
be
considered
to
be
unmanned
at
the
time
of
goett's
death
because
there
were
men
working
aboard
her,
although
when
the
barge
was
actually
in
transit,
she
is
unmanned
as
well
as
being
unpowered.
she
is
simply
a
floating
steel
tank.
the
court
further
stated
that
at
the
time
of
goett's
death,
amherst,
the
repair
yard
owner
had
the
exclusive
control
over
the
vessel.
and
as
conclusions
of
law,
the
court
stated
that
the
case
involved
negligence
that
there
was
liability
because
of
the
fault
of
carbide
in
failing
to
set
forth
or
place
upon
the
vessel
that
safety
equipment,
that
the
case
was
not
one
of
liability
without
fault.
and
although
i
would
say
for
a
moment
that
that
statement
by
the
court
is
open
to
interpretation,
i
have
interpreted
it
to
mean
that
the
court
found
that
because
of
the
negligence
with
fault,
found
where
the
liability
with
fault
found
against
carbide,
the
court
then
felt
it
did
not
have
to
say
there
was
also
liability
without
fault
because
it
did
find
that
the
fault
did
exist.
the
court
further
stated
that
there
was
no
contributory
negligence
because
of
course
being
a
death
case
the
burden
was
upon
amherst
and
carbide
to
determine
why
goett
fell
off
the
vessel
and
of
course
there
was
no
evidence
ever
brought
forth
as
to
the
reason
why
he
actually
fell.
the
court
further
stated
that
there
was
no
assumption
of
risk.
it
stated
that
while
goett
may
have
possibly
assumed
the
risk
of
falling
off
the
vessel
itself
the
actual
falling
into
the
river
which
was
based
--
which
was
the
--
the
grounding
of
the
case
itself,
the
actual
failure
to
rescue
that
goett
did
not
risk
at
all.
he
assumed
no
risk
of
the
failure
to
rescue
itself.
since
the
case
was
predicated
upon
the
west
virginia
wrongful
death
statute
which
had
a
monetary
limitation
of
$20,000,
the
court
said
that
it
would
find
that
that
monetary
limitation
was
applicable
and
determined
that
there
was
--
there
would
be
an
award
of
$20,000.
however,
in
order
to
avoid
a
possible
second
trial
in
the
matter,
we
asked
the
court
and
the
court
did
find
an
alternative
damages
under
the
damages
rule
of
the
general
maritime
law
and
that
was
in
the
sum
of
$50,000.
the
court
then
determined
that
there
was
--
should
be
no
indemnification
over
from
carbide
to
amherst
because
carbide
itself
was
the
party
who
was
actively
negligent
in
failing
to
place
the
equipment
aboard
the
vessel.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court
decision
on
these
grounds.
number
one,
the
court
said
that
there
was
both
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
claimed
by
the
petitioner
in
the
case.
the
court
then
said
that
as
far
as
unseaworthiness
was
concerned,
goett
was
not
a
member
of
that
class
to
whom
the
talking
of
unseaworthiness
would
apply.
the
court
further
stated
that
it
did
not
agree
with
the
district
court
judge
and
found
that
the
barge
was
seaworthy
at
the
time
of
goett's
death.
as
for
the
negligence
count,
the
court
stated
that
the
only
duty
owed
to
goett
by
carbide,
was
to
warn
goett
of
any
latent
defects
not
patent
defects
and
that
the
lack
of
safety
equipment
aboard
the
vessel
was
obviously
known
to
goett
as
well
as
everyone
else
and
therefore
carbide,
had
performed
its
complete
duty
to
goett
and
could
not
be
negligent.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court's
decision
in
the
harrisburg
in
1886
was
left
open
since
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
felt
that
it
certainly
was
a
matter
for
this
court
to
take
up.
the
harrisburg,
as
this
court
well
knows,
is
the
decision
and
as
a
practical
matter
the
only
decision,
which
has
stated
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
under
the
general
maritime
law,
absent
a
state
statute.
all
of
the
cases
which
have
confirmed
or
affirmed
the
--
the
doctrine
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
have
cited
the
harrisburg
as
the
prevailing
reason
for
the
ruling
itself.
and
so
the
only
--
the
only
case
that
is
really
involved
here
is
the
question
of
whether
harrisburg
was
a
correct
enunciation
of
law
by
this
court
some
60
or
70
years
ago.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes,
i
believe
that
if
i
do
overcome
the
harrisburg
decision
and
that
this
court
now
reverses
its
ruling
in
the
harrisburg
that
there
would
be
i
think
as
a
matter
of
course
the
statement
that
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
under
the
general
maritime
law
for
wrongful
death
even
absent
a
state
statute
on
the
subject
because
all
of
the
cases
cited
both
by
this
court
and
various
other
courts
have
uniformly
cited
the
harrisburg
as
the
controlling
case
on
the
subject.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
well
i
think
tungus
also
cited
the
harrisburg
or
if
it
did
not
it
cited
cases
which
in
turn
cited
harrisburg
as
controlling
on
this
subject.
so
that
we
get
down
to
the
--
to
the
point
of
harrisburg
setting
the
ruling
or
setting
the
pace
for
the
ruling
in
1886
and
then
the
--
the
cases
coming
afterward
simply
citing
harrisburg
as
the
controlling
case.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
i
would
assume
so
and
i
hope
so.
in
harrisburg,
which
was
an
action
in
rem,
there
were
three
questions
set
up
by
the
supreme
court
and
that
was
number
one,
whether
or
not
a
cause
of
action
under
the
maritime
law
would
exist
absent
a
state
statute.
number
two,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
remedy
if
there
was
a
state
statute
which
the
general
maritime
law
or
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
could
then
accept.
and
number
three,
if
the
state
statute
of
limitations
would
then
be
held
applicable
in
a
case
arising
out
of
a
maritime
tort.
the
court
first
freely
conceded
that
under
french
or
under
scottish
law,
there
was
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death.
and
they
stated
that
under
the
english
law,
as
we
know
there
was
a
common
law
maxim
and
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
under
british
law
for
wrongful
death.
they
then
held
that
they
found
no
case
in
which
any
country
or
any
civilized
country
had
a
different
ruling
for
a
maritime
tort
as
it
would
have
for
a
tort
which
occurred
on
land.
and
therefore
since
we
were
a
common
law
nation
as
was
england
and
england
did
not
have
such
a
right
of
recovery,
that
we
could
then
not
have
a
right
of
recovery
either.
the
court
further
stated
and
i
find,
of
course,
that
this
sentence
is
open
to
construction,
but
the
court
stated
that
we
must
declare
what
the
law
is
not
what
it
should
be
or
not
what
we
think
it
should
be.
and
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
that
the
court
felt
that
it
was
setting
forth
a
very,
very
narrow
doctrine
on
a
legalistic
or
technical
point
which
they
felt
bound
to
follow
not
which
what
they
found
would
be
acceptable
to
them
as
an
equitable
question.
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
reason
for
the
british
rule
must
come
under
some
scrutiny.
certainly,
i
believe
it
is
well
known
that
under
the
civil
law,
under
the
french
law,
under
the
scottish
law,
in
fact
under
the
law
of
most
continental
nations
which
was
predicated
upon
the
roman
law
there
was
and
always
has
been
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
arising
out
of
a
tort.
i
think
it's
also
conceded
that
maritime
law,
as
we
know
today,
came
into
england
at
a
comparatively
late
date,
somewhere
around
the
12th
century
and
that
at
time,
the
law
came
into
an
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
so
to
speak
through
the
common
law
itself.
that
is,
the
maritime
law
became
one
of
the
king's
prerogatives
and
which
the
king
used
to
attack
parliament
and
the
common
law
which
were
lined
up
on
the
same
side.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
i
think
for
these
reasons
sir.
if
the
harrisburg
decision
is
now
overruled,
and
the
court
finds
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
from
general
--
under
the
general
maritime
law
absent
of
any
statute,
i
think
that
the
court
would
find
in
following
that
ruling
that
all
of
the
duties,
all
of
the
responsibilities
as
between
the
parties
would
be
determined
by
what
we
now
consider
the
general
maritime
law
principles,
such
as
the
lack
of
assumption
of
risk,
such
as
the
duty
that
would
evolve
upon
carbide
in
this
case
under
the
maritime
law
as
against
state
law.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
no,
sir.
it
felt
that
it
did
not
have
to
decide
that
because
it
found
that
goett
was
not
of
the
class
and
also
that
the
vessel
was
seaworthy.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
the
district
court
simply
made
that
one
--
i
would
say
unclear
statement
that
we
find
that
there
is
no
liability
without
fault
applicable
here.
this
is
a
negligence
case.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
district
court
meant
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness
or
simply
whether
it
did
not
have
to
find
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
for
liability
without
fault
since
it
found
liability
with
fault
was
open
and
i
think
it's
open
to
interpretation.
i
don't
know
the
answer
for
sure.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
no
sir,
no
sir.
that
is
not
my
point
at
all.
i
would
say
this.
that
the
overruling
of
that
case
would
then
take
away
all
of
these
various
questions
which
exist
in
this
case,
in
the
skovgaard
case,
in
the
halecki
case
and
there
are
all
of
the
cases
coming
before
those
since
the
cases
would
then
simply
follow
as
a
usual
run
of
the
mill
if
i
might
say
cause
of
action
under
the
general
maritime
law
so
that
there
would
be
absolutely
no
difference
whether
or
not
the
case
was
one
for
personal
injury
or
for
wrongful
death.
now
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
has
and
i
think
it
has
determined
it
in
my
favor,
but
not
in
my
decision.
that's
the
problem.
it
determined
it
in
a
later
case.
the
various
questions
which
the
court
felt
it
did
not
have
to
answer
in
this
case
below,
it
then
answered
in
a
later
case
this
past
july,
the
case
of
holley
against
s.s.
manfred
which
is
269
fd.
2nd
and
it
stated
there
and
i
might
add
that
that
was
a
case
coming
out
of
virginia,
and
not
west
virginia,
it
--
but
having
the
same
language
in
its
wrongful
death
statute.
it
stated
there
that
the
language
if
death
had
not
ensued
could
only
be
interpreted
as
saying
that
there
should
be
no
difference
at
all
between
an
action
for
a
wrongful
death
and
an
action
for
personal
injuries.
the
court
cited
with
approval
the
halecki
case
which
stated
just
that
same
thing
that
it
would
--
well
in
fact
learned
hand,
justice
learned
hand
stated
that
it
would
be
to
the
last
degree
capricious
and
irrational
to
say
that
there
should
be
a
difference
of
duties
as
between
the
parties
simply
because
there
was
a
wrongful
death
case
and
not
a
case
of
personal
injuries.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
well,
i
would
think
that
based
--
or
predicated
upon
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
already
stated
in
holley,
in
the
holley
case,
i
would
think
that
this
court
could
now
find
that
in
this
case
the
circuit
court
would
find
the
same
thing.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
it
involved
virginia
as
well
as
(voice
overlap)
that
in
the
west
virginia
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes
sir
but
that
part
of
the
statute
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
part
--
that
is
correct
sir,
but
that
part
of
the
statute
was
not
involved.
the
only
part
of
the
statute
and
the
basis
for
the
holley
case
decision
was
that
part
that
stated,
“if
death
had
not
ensued,”
and
of
course
that
exact
language
is
in
the
west
virginia
statute
also.
and
in
addition
to
that
there
are
many,
many
west
virginia
statute
--
cases
in
which
the
courts
of
west
virginia
have
stated
that
they
will
construe
similar
statutes
as
west
virginia
--
as
virginia
in
like
manner
to
which
the
statutes
of
virginia
have
already
been
construed.
so
that
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that's
correct
sir.
that
is
correct
or
an
alternative
would
have
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
circuit
court
for
a
further
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
the
west
virginia
statute
would
now
say
the
same
thing.
going
to
harrisburg
for
a
moment,
i
think
first
that
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
reason
for
the
lack
of
difference
between
sea
and
land
decisions
under
the
civil
law
is
that
the
maritime
law
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
civil
law
today
and
has
always
been
part
and
parcel
of
that
law.
second,
the
fact
that
there
is
no
difference
in
the
english
law
between
land
and
sea
decisions
is
that
very
simply,
the
admiralty
law
has
been
made
subservient
to
the
common
law
in
england
and
was,
shall
i
say,
part
of
the
price
paid
by
the
king
in
england
when
he
was
restored
after
the
--
after
the
defeat
of
cromwell.
now
that
defeat
of
cromwell
was
engineered
by
parliament
and
the
price
that
the
king
had
to
pay
the
parliament,
and
the
common
law
was
the
taking
away
or
the
subservient
position
of
the
king's
prerogatives
among
which
was
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
so
that
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
for
the
first
time
in
1664
or
1668
became
subservient
and
followed
the
same
rule
as
the
common
law
to
which
the
common
law
(inaudible)
mr.
harvey
goldstein
i
will
sir
in
one
second.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
but
you're
--
you're
assuming
i
--
i
assume
you're
mentioning
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
and
--
and
the
jones
act
itself.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
is
correct
sir
but
it
did
not
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
common
law
death
maxim
was
in
fact
do
or
should
have
been
overruled.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
is
correct
but
i
don't
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
may
i
say
this?
number
one
i
do
not
consider
that
congress
expressly
shut
out
any
further
judicial
decision
on
the
point.
i
think
simply
that
congress
was
legislating
on
a
national
basis
on
a
maritime
cause
of
action
and
they
felt
that
this
particular
matter
at
this
point
was
such
that
state
statute
should
control
in
the
matter,
but
that
does
not
say
that
congress
shut
the
door
to
any
further
statement
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
it
did
not
say
that
all.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
i
think
that
in
addition
to
a
legal
reasoning
for
overruling
harrisburg
and
that
is
that
there
has
been
and
never
was
any
merger
under
american
law
with
the
english
law
concerning
the
wrongful
death
statute
or
--
or
the
right
of
action
under
the
general
maritime
law
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
of
course
is
something.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes,
i
think
perhaps.
i
think
the
court
--
this
court
in
funk
against
united
states
has
expressly
shown
that
this
court
now
has
the
power
to
rule
on
the
basis
of
social
outlook
rather
than
on
strict
legal
technicality
and
by
that
i
mean
this.
in
funk,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
common
law
rule
as
to
evidence
of
a
wife
not
testifying
against
the
husband
was
involved.
mr.
justice
sutherland
said,
“there
is
no
rhyme,
no
reason
why
the
common
law
doctrine
should
stand
that
we
consider
that
conditions
have
been
so
altered
at
this
time
that
we
should
now
make
a
rule
in
the
light
of
present
conditions
and
he
then
proceeded
to
overrule
the
common
law
maxim
as
to
that
point.
i
think
recent
cases
in
various
high
state
courts
have
shown
that
the
courts
do
not
feel
that
they
are
bound
to
withhold
judgment
because
of
any
lack
of
legislation
on
the
point.
i
have
for
example
the
case
of
woods
against
lancet
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
when
new
york
stated
that
a
cause
of
action
for
an
unborn
child
would
now
be
permitted
whereas
on
the
common
law
it
was
never
permitted.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
no,
sir.
when
--
when
you
say
operation
you
mean
transit,
actual
transit?
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes
sir.
yes.
she
was
unmanned.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
no.
i
intend
moving
to
the
negligence
part
of
the
case
right
now
sir.
as
to
the
negligence
part
of
the
case
itself,
since
holley
has
now
determined
that
the
negligence
or
the
duty
of
carbide
should
be
determined
under
maritime
law,
and
not
under
the
state
law
doctrine,
that
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
stating
that
the
sole
duty
of
carbide
was
to
warn
goett
of
latent
defects
could
not
possibly
be
applicable
to
this
case
since
under
the
general
maritime
law
it's
a
well-established
fact
i
believe
that
the
duty
of
any
vessel
owner
is
still
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work.
now
the
question
of
whether
or
not
goett
assumed
the
risk,
i
think,
can
be
clarified
very
briefly.
assuming
then,
that
under
the
holley
decision,
the
doctrine
of
assumption
of
risk
must
be
determined
by
maritime
law
and
not
state
law,
it
then
becomes
obvious
that
under
maritime
law
the
test
being,
whether
or
not,
goett
had
a
freedom
of
choice
of
safe
or
unsafe
conditions,
or
safe
or
unsafe
equipment,
that
there
was
no
freedom
of
choice
in
this
case
and
that
therefore,
goett
could
not
have
not
assumed
the
risk.
one
further
point
as
to
the
question
of
the
$20,000
limitation,
under
the
west
virginia
statute
i
think
that
that
limitation
although
the
state
--
that
statute
must
be
taken
as
a
substantive
hold
is
also
qualified
by
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
admiralty
forum
as
can
any
forum
decide
that
such
a
limitation
is
against
the
public
policy
of
the
forum.
now
if
that
is
so,
and
i
believe
it
is,
the
admiralty
forum
then
has
the
right
and
in
fact
has
the
duty
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
monetary
limitation
by
a
foreign
forum
is
then
against
the
public
policy
of
the
forum
in
which
the
case
is
being
tried.
now
that
being
so,
i
think
the
admiralty
rule
that
there
should
no
limitation
of
money
recovery
under
any
circumstances
must
follow
to
be
applicable
here
in
this
case.
the
workmen
case
is
the
major
case
that
i
refer
to.
in
workmen,
there
was
a
municipal
statute
in
which
the
city
of
new
york
was
bound
to
limit
its
own
liability
to
$10,000.
the
liability
in
that
case
exceeded
that
amount.
and
the
question
before
this
court
at
that
time
was
whether
or
not
the
full
indemnification
should
be
paid
or
whether
or
not
there
was
indeed
the
limitation
of
$10,000.
and
this
court
stated
that
it
would
be
in
derogation
of
general
maritime
rights
and
duties
to
say
that
any
state
could
limit
its
liability
in
a
case
arising
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
that
case
as
much
as
any,
simply
states
for
the
proposition
that
there
can
be
no
limitation
of
any
recovery
in
a
maritime
tort.
thank
you.
