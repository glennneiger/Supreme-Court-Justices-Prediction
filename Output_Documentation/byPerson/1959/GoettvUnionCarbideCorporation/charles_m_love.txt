mr.
charles
m.
love
if
your
honors
please,
before
proceeding
with
what
oral
argument
i
have,
i
would
like
to
answer
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
courts
have
decided
this
question
of
what
law
would
apply.
the
state
court
--
the
answer
given
to
you
by
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
decided
it.
now
the
state
courts
have
not
decided
it,
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
not
decided
it
as
to
west
virginia
yet
did
in
the
holley
versus
manfred
case
decided
by
the
same
court
which
decided
the
instant
case
which
is
presently
before
your
honors.
with
regard
to
the
virginia
statute
decided
that
it
would
apply
admiralty
rules
but
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
a
different
statute
and
specifically
recognizes
the
rights
in
rem
and
against
ships
which
the
west
virginia
statute
does
not.
i
might
further
point
out
historically
that
the
virginia
statute
was
amended
after
a
decision
which
probably
indicated
that
it
should
have
been
amended
but
it
certainly
has
no
effect
on
west
virginia
anymore
than
--
than
a
higher
statute
or
a
california
statute.
now
i
would
like
to
say
to
your
honors
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
extremely
simple.
on
a
beautiful
day
in
west
virginia,
and
this
is
shown
by
the
record
that
it
was
80
degrees
and
clear
in
october
in
1955
a
sandblaster
by
the
name
of
marvin
goett,
who'd
been
employed
for
many
months
by
the
amherst
barge
company
which
was
a
company
which
not
only
operated
barges
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
it
repaired
barges,
and
it
had
a
contract
which
is
in
the
record,
to
repair
this
barge,
cc204
owned
by
union
carbide.
marvin
goett,
as
a
sandblaster,
was
and
--
at
which
occupation
he
worked
for
many
months
was
on
the
deck
of
this
dumb
barge
as
they're
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
plaintiff's
counsel
referred
to
it
as
a
floating
tank.
it
has
a
flat
deck.
it's
crowned
six
inches
in
the
center.
it
has
no
other
superstructure
except
the
pipeline
down
the
middle,
and
it's
simply
a
--
a
floating
tank
with
a
flat
top
subject
to
that
six-inch
crown.
it's
a
195
feet
long
and
i
believe
50
feet
wide.
now
mr.
goett
was
sandblasting
on
that
barge
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
he'd
been
working
on
it
and
suddenly
they
noticed
he
was
gone.
nobody
knows
whether
he
fell
into
the
river,
whether
he
jumped
into
the
river,
whether
he
was
pushed
into
the
river
or
how
it
happened.
the
evidence
is
simply
silent
as
the
plaintiff's
counsel
requests
to
this
court
and
says
in
his
bait,
nobody
knows
how
the
man
got
in
the
river.
he
was
found
in
the
river.
now,
whether
or
not
that
proved
negligence
against
anybody
under
any
circumstances,
i
don't
know
but
those
are
the
facts
in
this
case,
supplemented
to
be
fair
to
some
extent
by
the
fact
that
he
was
seen
from
one
to
five
minutes
before
that
time
using
this
sandblasting
machine
which
is
quite
a
machine
by
the
way
and
has
two
hoses.
it
has
to
be
constantly
replaced
with
sand
and
has
power
to
propel
that
sand
with
such
force
against
the
object
to
be
cleaned
that
it
will
strike
off
the
impurities
and
defects.
he
was
wearing
not
only
a
hood
to
protect
himself
from
the
sand
which
came
down
all
over
his
shoulders
and
was
--
there's
some
kind
of
an
icing
glass
or
other
transparent
front
on
it
but
also
a
respirator
to
keep
from
breathing
the
sand.
he
had
all
of
those
at
the
same
time.
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
plaintiff
expert
in
this
case,
captain
evagate
said
that
he
never
saw
anybody
sandblasting
on
a
tank
without
wearing
a
life
jacket
which
mr.
goett
did
not
have
on.
anyway,
he
fell
into
the
river
and
the
evidence
was
that
he
was
in
the
river
from
10
to
15
to
20
minutes
before
he
went
down.
the
evidence
further
was
that
there
was
a
life
ring
on
the
digger
boat
attached
to
which
the
barge
was
attached.
now
--
mr.
charles
m.
love
the
digger
boat
in
this
evidence,
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
thank
you
for
asking
me,
the
name
digger
as
i
understand
it,
has
no
particular
significance
except
that
in
this
case
it
is
a
permanently
moored
boat
to
which
this
barge
and
other
barges
which
this
contractor
works
on
is
permanently
attached
down
river.
in
other
words
it
takes
place
of
the
tow
boat
if
it
were
in
transits,
but
--
mr.
charles
m.
love
the
judges
--
no
sir.
and
it's
not
in
the
record.
i
think
i
know
how
it
got
its
name
but
anyway
if
for
this
case
it
simply
takes
the
place
of
the
barge.
well
with
respect
to
the
barge
itself,
now
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
m.
love
from
10
to
15,
maybe
to
20
minutes
i
can
cite
your
honor
to
the
place
in
the
record
that
that
is
--
now
record
page
81
and
82
and
i'd
say
that
he
fell
off
the
rescuers,
nobody
knows
why.
there
was
the
assumption
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff's
counsel
that
he
--
it
was
because
of
panic
and
it
may
well
have
been,
i
don't
know.
mr.
charles
m.
love
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
charles
m.
love
no
your
honor,
there
were
no
union
carbide
employees
or
agents
there
from
the
time
--
from
before
the
time
this
happened
until
the
7th
that
was
two
days
later
and
for
that
time,
the
barge
had
taken
up
on
the
marine
way
out
of
the
river.
the
--
this
trial
court
found
then
the
court
of
appeals
also
that
--
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
simply
affirmed
it.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
barge
was
in
the
exclusive
custody
and
control
of
the
contracting
company,
the
amherst
barge
company.
i
started
to
say
something
about
the
barge.
i
--
i
described
it
somewhat
and
i
--
i
only
want
to
say
further
that
it
was
turned
over
to
amherst
in
exactly
the
same
condition
that
it
was
used
and
had
been
used
since
its
purchase
in
1948.
and
there
was
nothing
taken
off
of
the
barge
and
nothing
put
on
it.
it
was
simply
delivered
as
the
contract
required
to
the
dock
and
marine
ways
of
the
amherst
barge
company
for
these
repairs.
whether
these
repairs
were
major
or
minor,
i
don't
know.
i
do
know
that
it
--
they
cost
about
10%
of
the
original
cost
of
the
barge
therefore
i
think
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
original
cost
to
something
over
$48,000
and
the
cost
of
these
of
repairs
was
$4700
and
something.
i
don't
know
that
that
is
material,
but
anyway,
it
was
delivered
to
amherst
in
exactly
the
same
condition
that
it
was
operated.
on
that
particular
point,
your
honors
will
remember
that
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioners
that
not
only
that
we
should
deliver
the
barge
as
it
is
but
that
we
should
do
something
special
to
the
barge
as
to
the
barge
when
actually
it
is
being
taken
out
of
navigation
and
being
delivered
to
a
contractor
for
work
extensive
enough
to
require
dry
docking.
now
the
history
of
this
litigation
pretty
well
told
your
honors
by
the
plaintiff's,
the
petitioner's
attorney.
this
was
action
was
brought
on
the
law
side
of
--
on
the
civil
side,
i
should
say,
in
the
federal
court
in
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia
and
after
it
was
brought
against
union
carbide
only,
union
carbide
filed
a
third
party
complaint
as
it
could
under
the
federal
rules
bringing
in
the
contractor,
the
barge
company
and
then
answering.
the
case
pend
--
was
pending
for
--
i
don't
something
over
a
year
but
it
was
transferred
into
admiralty
on
the
day
of
trial.
now
it
is
true
that
some
two
weeks
prior
to
that
time,
the
court
had
announced
it
would
sustain
a
motion
then
made
to
transfer
the
case
into
admiralty.
i
repeat
that
not
because
i
think
it
is
of
much
importance,
but
because
i
think
it
points
up
to
some
extent
what
we
are
discussing
in
this
case.
i
listen
as
i'm
sure
your
honors
did
to
the
attack
upon
the
harrisburg
and
not
only
upon
the
harrisburg
i
might
say
but
upon
the
dozens
of
cases
cited
in
footnote
number
one
of
our
brief
following
the
rule
laid
down
by
the
harrisburg
and
insinuating
that
this
is
a
great
social
or
moral
problem
which
is
being
presented
to
the
court
at
this
time
and
that
here
is
a
wrong
which
cries
out
for
righting
and
in
injustice
concerning
which
something
should
be
done
as
extreme
as
to
overrule
many
cases
of
this
court
or
even
one
case
of
this
court
and
to
ignore
at
least
two
acts
of
congress
which
have
touched
upon
the
matter,
significantly.
now
--
mr.
charles
m.
love
thank
you.
may
the
court
please,
at
the
time
of
recess,
i
was
attempting
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
great
social
or
moral
injustice
to
be
righted
involved
in
this
case
and
i
would
like
to
say
to
your
honors
why
i
make
that
statement.
this
is
not
a
question
of
a
wrong
without
a
remedy.
this
plaintiff
already
has
remedies,
at
least
four
in
number.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
an
action
grounded
and
based
upon
the
west
virginia
wrongful
death
act
statute
which
is
cognizable
by
the
courts
of
west
virginia.
the
same
action
is
cognizable
under
proper
considerations
such
as
diversity
of
citizenship
in
the
federal
courts.
in
addition
to
that,
this
petitioner
has
her
rights
under
the
west
virginia
workmen's
compensation
act
and/or
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act,
and
i
might
say
that
the
benefits
under
either
of
those
acts,
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
would
be
slightly
in
excess
of
$20,000
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
and
it
is
also
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
amherst
stated
to
the
court
through
its
counsel,
on
record
page
176
that
they
stand
ready
to
pay
that
at
any
time
and
also
in
the
record
at
page
78
that
petitioner's
counsel
stated
that
he
had
advised
the
petitioner
not
to
file
for
it
at
this
time,
but
she
can
file
for
it
at
anytime
she
wants
to.
now
what
is
involved
here
is
whether
or
not
there
shall
be
another,
an
additional
remedy
in
addition
to
these
four
which
this
petitioner
or
any
like
petitioner
already
has.
now
this
court
decided
in
the
harrisburg
and
subsequent
to
or
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
day
of
the
passage
the
great
lakes
act,
but
anyway,
congress
considered
the
matter
in
the
great
lakes
act
and
very
carefully
not
only
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
it
was
pointed
out
by
one
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
rendered
it
so
that
it
would
not
impinge
upon
the
state
wrongful
death
acts.
now
in
addition
to
that
in
the
jones
act,
the
same
matter
was
considered
and
in
the
jones
act,
which
provides
for
a
seaman
to
sue
his
employer,
the
same
right
was
also
carefully
limited.
so
what
we're
really
arguing
about
here
is
whether
in
addition
to
the
remedies
already
available
to
the
petitioner,
the
petitioner
and
others
like
him
or
like
her
shall
have
another
remedy.
now,
in
considering
this
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
necessary
and
as
indicated
by
one
of
the
questions
of
the
chief
justice
to
consider
what
--
what
procedural
questions
are
involved
because
that's
--
that's
all
it
is
assuming
that
the
tungus
is
correct
in
deciding
that
the
--
a
right
grounded
upon
a
state
act
must
be
taken
with
its
burdens
and
with
its
limitations.
now,
what
are
the
limitations
in
the
state
act
to
which
i
refer?
well,
one
of
them
is
and
the
principal
one
is
that
it
shall
arise
from
the
wrongful
act,
neglect,
or
default
of
another.
now
we've
argued
these
legal
questions
at
length
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
care
to
take
too
much
of
the
court's
time
about
this
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
other
limitations
in
the
state
act,
which
it
seems
to
me
are
important
and
which
preserve
to
litigants
certain
rights.
now
the
first
of
those
is
the
matter
of
negligence
or
the
proximate
cause
and
that
includes
the
question
of
the
duty
which
an
owner
holds
to
an
employee
of
an
independent
contractor
making
affairs.
it
includes
what
defenses
shall
be
allowed
to
the
defendant.
it
includes
the
question
of
the
limitation
of
the
amount
of
damages
which
a
defendant
may
recover.
and
in
addition,
it
includes
specifically
the
manner
in
which
those
damages
maybe
assessed.
now
the
west
virginia
act
says
that
the
plaintiff
may
have
to
get
the
exact
language,
every
such
action
shall
be
brought
by
and
in
the
name
of
the
person
or
representative
in
the
amount
distributed
as
provided
by
law,
and
in
every
such
action
the
jury
--
the
jury
may
give
such
damages
as
they
shall
deem
fair
and
just
and
then
later,
it
says
again
the
jury
may
give
such
damages,
as
shall
equal
such
financial
or
pecuniary
laws.
i
know
of
no
reason
and
none
has
been
cited
in
either
of
the
courts
why
that
explicit
provision
and
method
for
assessing
damages
should
be
ignored
by
any
court.
the
citation
of
the
workmen
and
siebel
cases
in
oral
argument
and
also
in
the
plaintiff's
brief,
it
seems
to
me
is
inadvertent
because
those
cases
like
many
other
cases
cited,
relate
to
matters
which
do
not
arise
under
state
grounded
--
state
based
rights
such
as
are
involved
here.
they
involve
limitations
which
a
state
tries
to
put
upon
collision
damages
and
things
which
are
--
like
that
which
are
clearly
within
the
purview
of
admiralty
and
of
course
cannot
and
should
not
be
limited
by
state
law,
but
those
cases
have
no
application
to
a
case
in
which
the
right
is
grounded,
if
there
is
a
right
at
all.
it's
grounded
upon
the
state
wrongful
death
acts.
now
there
is
one
further
question
which
i
don't
know
whether
it
will
be
reached
by
this
court
or
not,
and
that
is
a
question
of
indemnification.
it
seems
to
me
that
carbide
having
delivered
a
barge
to
an
independent
contractor
in
the
condition
in
which
it
was
operated
and
in
the
condition
in
which
it
was
certificated,
with
all
of
the
equipment
which
it
was
supposed
to
carry
to
an
independent
contractor
for
repairs
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
in
any
way
negligent
even
under
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
or
otherwise
in
this
case.
and
we
so
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
there
was
negligence,
it
was
not
the
negligence
of
carbide
but
the
negligence
of
those
who
created
the
condition
and
i'm
not
admitting
that
the
condition
was
negligent,
but
it
certainly
if
it
was
negligence,
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
company
which
created
it,
that
is
to
say
the
amherst
barge
company.
now
they
knew
that
men
were
going
to
be
working
there,
that
their
men
were
going
to
be
working
there,
that
they
were
going
to
be
working
there
with
respirators
and
hoods
and
it
was
up
to
amherst
barge
company
to
determine
when
the
barge
should
be
taken
out
of
the
river
and
on
the
marine
ways
which
were
just
almost
immediately
adjacent,
they
were
adjacent.
in
point
of
fact,
when
the
next
time
carbide
had
a
man
there
which
was
on
the
7th,
it's
two
days
after
the
drowning,
the
barge
was
upon
the
ways
and
at
that
time,
extension
had
been
erected.
of
course,
the
barge
was
up
in
the
air
then
on
the
marine
ways,
but
at
that
time,
extension
was
in
a
rope
had
been
placed
around
the
outside
of
the
barge
over
dry
land.
now
how
those
conditions
could
be
charged
to
the
owner
of
a
dumb
barge,
a
vessel
which
never
had
a
crew,
which
either
before
or
after
this
unfortunate
event
would
not
have
any
crew
to
do
anything
on
the
barge,
i
don't
know.
with
the
--
and
with
respect
to
that
question,
we
have
argued
at
some
length
for
which
i
apologize
to
your
honors,
as
to
this
matter
of
indemnification.
it
was
not
reached
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
since
that
time,
the
fischer
case
has
been
decided
by
this
court,
which
i
believe
answers
most
of
the
questions
with
respect
thereto
and
i
will
not
further
argue.
in
conclusion,
we
would
like
to
submit
to
your
honors,
that
no
negligence
has
been
shown
against
carbide
in
this
case
either
on
the
theory
of
negligence
generally
or
upon
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness,
and
if
it
has
been
shown
that
this
decedent
was
entitled
to
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness,
which
we
deny,
then
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
barge
was
as
seaworthy
as
it
ever
was
when
it
was
even
--
when
it
was
in
actual
operation.
and
here,
it
of
course
had
been
withdrawn
from
navigation
and
was
in
the
exclusive
custody
and
control
of
this
contractor.
there
was
nobody
on
it.
of
course,
that
was
not
unusual
because
there
was
never
anybody
on
this
barge.
now
what
the
plaintiff
would
have
your
honors
find
is
that
the
condition
of
the
barge
when
withdrawn
from
navigation
never
having
a
crew,
never
being
required
to
have
any
lifelines
or
any
rings
which
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
maintain
because
these
things
are
left
around
unattended,
they're
simply
moved
around
like
floating
rafts
or
barges,
that
at
the
time
we
withdrew
from
navigation
and
--
then
we
should
then
change
the
conditions
and
furnish
ropes
and
scaffoldings
and
ladders
and
whatever
else
might
facilitate
or
make
the
work
of
the
contractor
safer.
we
know
of
no
case
so
holding
and
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
was
right
and
should
be
affirmed.
