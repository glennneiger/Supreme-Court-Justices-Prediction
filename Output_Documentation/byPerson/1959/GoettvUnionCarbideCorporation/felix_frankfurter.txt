but
we
would
have
to
make
a
jump
and
say,
“west
virginia
--
virginia
equals
west
virginia
and
therefore
west
equals
virginia?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
go
to
the
american
history?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
and
taken
into
account
something
that
gives
me
much
more
relevance
in
government
as
to
cromwell,
namely,
that
after
harrisburg,
congress
dealt
with
this
problem.
it
would
seem
to
find
those
difficulties
that
congress
dealt
with
this
problem,
but
chose
to
deal
with
it
in
its
own
way,
namely,
in
a
very
limited
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
exactly
what
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now
what
do
you
do
with
that?
and
not
only
did
they
deal
in
the
restricted
way
but
it
expressly
dealt
with
by
reference
to
the
state
survival
statute,
(inaudible)
to
the
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
it
dealt
with
the
problem.
it
dealt
with
this
very
problem
and
instead
of
doing
what
was
one
can
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
general
outlay,
but
this
is
a
survivor,
and
the
old
common
law
limitation
upon
the
survivorship
generally
and
(inaudible)
the
admiralty
law.
congress
faced
that
problem
but
chose
to
deal
with
it
through
the
--
it
was
there
in
a
--
within
a
very
restricted
caucus
and
explicitly
so
far
as
then
congress
speaks
explicitly
in
the
statutory
language
it
said
this
(inaudible)
retain
all
the
states
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
now
asking
us
to
say,
“despite
that
--
despite
that
for
the
congress
to
hold
because
it's
called
there
as
in
many
ways
initiating
powers
in
regard
to
maritime
matters,
we
should
now
overrule
--
it
has
spoken
in
this
regard
for
it
to
follow
including
its
important
legislative
means,
very
important
legislative
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
supreme
court
should
not
overrule
itself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
did
not
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
did
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
mentioned
in
your
colloquy,
i
think
we
deal
--
we've
raised
a
very
interesting
question
if
congress
had
said
that
and
an
enterprising
lawyer
like
you
would
come
to
this
court
and
say,
“of
course
congress
can't
bind
your
--
and
you're
under
article
iii.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you'd
make
that
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
west
virginia
word?
is
it?
