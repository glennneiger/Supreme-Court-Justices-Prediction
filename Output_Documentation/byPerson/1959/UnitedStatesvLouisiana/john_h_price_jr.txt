mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
patterson
said
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
mississippi
prior
to
the
lunch
hour.
now
there
the
claim
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
mississippi
does
not
evolve
from
shoreline
but
from
the
islands.
the
government
contends
and
concedes
to
the
state
of
mississippi
that
the
state
of
mississippi
line
under
the
--
boundary
line
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
extends
three
miles
seaward
from
the
seaward
side
of
the
islands
on
the
perimeter
of
our
shoreline.
if
the
court
can
see
here,
we
have
a
chain
of
islands
meeting
from
the
east
to
west
here.
we
have
petit
bois,
horn,
ship,
and
cat
islands.
ship
island
is
more
than
three
leagues
from
the
coastline.
it
measured
approximately
about
three
and
one
half
leagues
from
the
seaward
side
of
ship
island
to
our
--
to
our
shoreline,
i
should
have
said.
these
other
islands
are
closer.
petit
bois
island,
near
the
closest
point,
is
about
six
geographical
or
nautical
miles
from
the
shoreline
and
ship
island
is
the
farthest
island
away.
so
the
only
controversy
between
the
state
of
mississippi
and
a
federal
government
here
is
the
difference
between
a
--
a
measure
from
three
miles
south
of
and
seaward
--
from
the
seaward
side
of
this
chain
of
islands
here
which
they
regard
as
our
coastline
under
the
submerged
lands
act
and
upon
which
we
claim
to
be
three
leagues
from
this,
the
seaward
side
of
these
islands
into
the
gulf,
not
to
exceed
however,
six
leagues
from
shore.
and
the
reason
for
the
exception
of
course
is,
since
ship
island
is
more
than
three
leagues
from
our
shoreline,
we
cannot
claim
under
our
boundary
description,
under
our
enabling
act
and
act
of
admission
that
we
go
a
full
league,
full
three
leagues
from
the
seaward
side
of
this
island.
we
are
bound
by
our
boundary
of
description.
we
recognize
that
fact.
therefore,
at
every
other
point
almost
on
our
coastline
here,
we
can
go
out
full
six
leagues
from
shore,
but
at
this
one
point
here,
we
cannot
go
quite
so
far.
we
can
only
go
--
our
maximum
distance
is
six
leagues
from
shore.
now,
the
basis
of
our
description
and
our
boundary
is
on
our
enabling
act
in
eight
--
may
18
--
march
1817,
and
it
read
thusly,
“the
inhabitants
of
the
western
part
of
the
mississippi
territory
be
and
they
hereby
are
authorized
to
form
for
themselves
a
constitution
and
state
government.”
and
section
2
picks
up,
“and
be
it
further
enacted
that
the
said
state
shall
consist
of
all
the
territory
included
within
the
following
boundaries.”
you
see
the
word,
“boundaries”
used
there.
mr.
justice
harlan
has
pointed
out
on
several
occasions
during
the
course
of
the
arguments
here,
what
is
the
boundary.
if
the
court
please,
that
is
mississippi's
boundary
here,
which
should
be
described
hereafter
in
our
enabling
act.
they
so
specified
as
boundary
here,
to
wit,
without
reading
at
all
for
the
sake
of
brevity,
i'll
go
around
the
circumference
here.
beginning
up
to
the
southern
boundary
line
of
the
state
of
tennessee
which
strikes
the
mississippi
river,
it
comes
around
to
the
tennessee
river
and
thence
up
to
tennessee
river
to
the
mouth
of
bear
creek.
it
gets
down
the
line
down
do
what
was
then,
the
northwest
corner
of
washington
county,
alabama.
i
believe
that
boundary
has
--
that
county
has
been
changed
somewhat,
but
then
it
was
the
northwest
corner
of
washington
county,
alabama.
it
thence
due
south
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
thence
westwardly,
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore,
to
the
most
eastern
junction
of
pearl
river
with
lake
borgne.
now,
those
were
as
important
--
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
that
--
that's
westward,
it
always
says,
your
honor
--
along
the
gulf
--
and
by
the
way,
i'll
--
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
it
thence
due
south
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
thence
westwardly,
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore
to
the
most
eastern
junction
of
pearl
river
with
lake
borgne.
now,
that
language
is
important
there
because
when
it
gets
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
runs
thence
westwardly,
it
doesn't
go
thence
westwardly
to
the
most
and
east
--
most
eastern
junction
of
pearl
river
with
lake
borgne
and
then
come
back.
and
as
an
afterthought,
say
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore.
to
me
the
effect
would
have
been
the
same.
but
i
emphasize
that
effect
because
the
boundary
description
comes
across
to
that
point
of
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and
then
it
runs
westwardly
and
embraces
all
this
area
here,
all
the
way
over
to
the
--
align
directly
to
the
most
eastern
junction
of
pearl
river
with
lake
borgne
here.
it
sweeps
the
whole
thing
across
one
arm.
it
sweeps
the
whole
area
after
the
six-league
limit
here
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
this
point
right
here,
and
a
continuation
of
this
line
drawn
from
the
southern
from
the
northwest
corner
of
washington
county,
alabama,
down
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
that
line
projected
out
here,
six
leagues
into
the
gulf
is
our
southeastern
boundary
line
--
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
--
under
our
description.
did
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
it
is
known
as
mississippi's
island,
your
honor.
and
getting
back
to
your
question
a
moment
ago,
if
i
may
answer
it
this
way,
as
you
quoted
the
paragraph
from
mr.
patterson
a
while
ago,
as
to
how
we
claimed
this
inland
water
between
the
mainland
and
the
islands
out
there.
first
of
all,
we
claim
it
by
our
boundary
description.
we
had
a
water
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
according
to
our
enabling
act
which
was
adopted
by
our
act
of
admission.
we
contend
that.
furthermore,
as
the
government
concedes
in
his
brief
on
page
254
of
its
original
main
brief,
in
eluding
factor
that
cross
statement
about
louisiana,
in
the
first
full
paragraph
there,
as
in
the
case
of
louisiana,
we
need
not
consider
whether
the
language
including
the
islands
et
cetera,
would
of
itself,
include
the
water
area
intervening
between
the
islands
and
the
mainland
though
we
believe
that
it
would
not,
because
it
happened
with
all
the
water,
so
situated
in
the
--
in
mississippi
is
in
mississippi
sound,
which
this
court
has
described
as
inland
water
and
cites
louisiana
versus
mississippi.
the
bed
of
these
inland
waters
passed
to
the
state
on
its
entry
into
the
union,
under
pollard's
lessee
versus
hagan
in
3
how.
212,
decided
in
1845.
so
also
we
agree
that
mississippi
has
a
marginal
belt
extending
three
miles
seaward
from
the
islands
marking
the
outer
limit
of
the
inland
waters
of
mississippi
sound,
under
the
ordinary
application
for
three-mile
rule.
and
then
it
sets
up
in
the
--
in
the
next
sentence
here,
the
only
issue
between
mississippi
and
the
government
is,
as
i've
mentioned
a
while
ago
in
beginning.
furthermore
of
course,
under
the
definition
in
--
of
the
coastline
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
which
is
clear
to
define
there,
specified
of
course
we
do
claim
that
area
also
under
--
under
their
submerged
lands
act.
that's
the
only
way
the
government
concedes
it
to
us,
by
virtue
of
being
inland
waters.
that
we
claim
it
by
our
boundary
description
and
also
this
court's
holding
in
--
in
pollard
versus
hagan,
in
1845.
now
going
from
here,
did
i
answer
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
but
not
to
--
not
to
exceed
three
leagues
from
the
seaward
side
of
the
island,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
that's
because
the
seaward
side
of
--
of
ship
island
here
is
moving
three
leagues
from
shore.
we
can't
claim
quite
so
much
at
that
point
do
you
we
think.
we
are
bound
by
our
boundary
description
of
six
leagues
from
shore.
therefore,
we
cannot
go
--
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
shore,
it's
right
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
--
right
up
here
on
the
--
right
up
here
gulfport
and
biloxi
along
that
shore,
it
wraps
to
move
some
since
the
state
came
into
the
union,
but
that
is
our
--
the
mainland
of
the
state
of
mississippi
right
there.
that's
here
--
that's
our
shoreline,
as
we
see
it.
now
furthermore,
in
pursuance
to
the
enabling
act
as
had
just
given,
under
your
court
or
given
by
the
federal
government
where
our
boundaries
were
set
in
enabling
act.
it
says
you
go
out
and
you
form
your
constitution
and
i
will
let
you
into
the
union.
so
we
did
so.
when
i
--
1817
--
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
right,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
i
will
come
to
that
--
i'll
--
i'd
recognize
that
to
be
important
to
the
court
and
i
will
come
to
that
and
--
and
stress
that
in
--
in
a
moment
or
two.
in
our
constitution
of
1817
pursuant
to
our
enabling
act,
we
started
--
we
represented
the
people
inhabiting
the
western
part
of
the
mississippi
territory,
contained
within
the
following
limits.
there
again,
we
set
our
boundaries
limits
are.
and
we
describe
our
boundary
the
same
as
they
were
described
in
our
enabling
act,
and
i
just
conclude
by
saying
and
thence
westwardly
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore
to
the
most
eastern
junction
of
pearl
river
with
lake
borgne.
now,
the
next
act
with
regard
to
our
coming
into
the
union
was
our
act
of
admission.
and
perhaps
i
should
read
it
to
the
court
to
show
how
we
do
refer
back
to
our
enabling
act,
“whereas
in
pursuance
to
an
act
of
congress
passed
on
the
1st
day
of
march,
1817,
entitled
an
act
to
enable
the
people
of
the
western
part
of
the
mississippi
territory
to
form
a
constitution
and
state
government
and
for
the
admission
of
each
state
--
of
such
state
into
the
union
on
equal
footing
with
the
original
states.”
incidentally
here,
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
place
in
the
constitution
that
equal
footing
appears,
except
in
these
acts
of
admission
that
the
court
inquired
about
this
morning.
the
people
of
said
territory,
did
on
the
15th
day
of
august
in
the
present
year
by
a
convention
called
for
that
purpose,
formed
for
our
--
themselves
a
constitution
and
state
government,
which
constitution
and
state
government
so
formed
as
republican.
and
in
conformity
to
the
principles
of
articles
of
compact
between
the
original
states
and
the
people
of
the
states
and
states
in
the
north
--
the
territory
northwest
of
the
river
ohio
etcetera.
so
that
--
it
refers
back
to
our
enabling
act.
so
we
come
to
the
point
that
the
government's
--
the
argument
there
that,
at
the
time,
means
this
boundary
relinquish
theory,
when
you
came
in,
you
could
not
claim
more
than
three
miles.
does
the
government
say
by
that
theory
that
when
they
set
out
boundaries
themselves
by
the
enabling
act
and
says
you
may
form
your
constitution,
if
you
do
so
on
republican
way
and
in
effect,
cite
these
boundaries,
we'll
let
you
in?
did
the
federal
government
reneged
on
its
agreement
prior
the
time
we
came
into
the
union?
if
you
follow
these
rules,
we'll
let
you
in
according
to
this
boundaries
authority.
therefore,
we
contend
the
submerged
lands
act
means
when
it
says,
as
it
existed
at
the
time
it
came
under
the
union
or
prior
to.
if
you
read
it
into
section
4
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
that
necessarily,
this
act
of
admission
is
not
a
one
second
proposition.
if
there's
a
continuing
act
from
the
enabling
act
to
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
then
on
to
the
act
of
admission,
that
is
bound
to
follow
by
any
reason
of
interpretation,
we
contend.
a
federal
rule
by
mississippi
constitution
of
1832
and
1869,
our
boundaries
were
not
changed.
in
1890,
we
started
off
by
saying
the
limits
and
boundaries
of
the
state
of
mississippi
are
as
follows,
and
described
them
--
substantially
a
lot
there
described
in
the
enabling
act
with
different
language
in
some
particulars.
but
then
we
come
down
thence
on
a
direct
line
from
this
--
what
was
formerly
washington
county,
alabama.
thence
on
a
direct
line
to
a
point,
10
miles
east
of
the
pascagoula
river
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
then
the
same
language
out
that
thence
westwardly
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore.
now
this,
as
mr.
patterson
said
this
morning,
this
six
--
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
the
point
--
your
honor,
that

there

mr.
john

that
says,
thence

down

mr.
john
h.

jr.
that's
over
here,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
it
comes
--
it
comes
to
crossover
to
that
point
here.
it's
a
line
out
from
that
area
into
the
gulf
of
mexico,
we
say
is
our
southwestern
boundary
line.
mr.

mr.
john
h.

jr.
this
point
here
is
the
most
eastern
junction
of
pearl
river
with
lake
borgne
when
you
come
across
from
the
southeastern
boundary
line
and
bring
all
the
islands
and

into
the
six-league
boundary
and
you
come
over

include
with
the

projected

into

just
six

at

mr.

that
is
the
government's
concession.
and
our
boundary
(inaudible)
comes
across,
and
under
on
louisiana
versus
mississippi,
it
was
projected
that
only
the
state
of
mississippi
is
somewhat
like
this.
and
it
withdrew
with
--
the
lines
would
follow
as
they
can
all
the
way
across
our
southern
boundary
line
as
i
understand
their
concession.
if
the
court
please,
hurrying
along
here,
we
claim
the
southern
portion
of
mississippi
this
part
here,
(inaudible)
on
1812
under
the
louisiana
purchase.
that
was
held
by
this
court
in
foster
versus
neilson.
we
occupied
it,
a
person
does
not
ought
to
occupy
by
proclamation
1810.
and
in
foster
versus
neilson,
this
court
held
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
legislative
branch
had
acted
in
asserting
a
claim
to
by
adding
to
the
mississippi
territory
in
1812
and
other
actions
that
it
was
taken
by
us
and
giver
out
--
granted
to
us
by
the
louisiana
purchase.
now,
the
most
important
part
i'd
like
to
get
to
you
now,
as
before
my
time
runs
out
is
the
fact
that
the
reasonable
basis
for
our
conclusion
here
that
our
line
doesn't
go
just
to
the
islands
out
there,
although
it
includes
the
islands,
it
goes
through
the
area
of
six
leagues
(inaudible),
six
leagues
from
shore.
and
historically
speaking
when
fort
massachusetts
were
built
on
ship
island
here,
in
about
1859,
congress
appropriated
money
for
it
and
built
by
1860
or
1861.
and
the
fort
then,
as
history
shows,
is
well
upon
the
mainland
and
ship
island.
at
the
present
time,
if
you
go
ship
island,
you
see
that
the
--
in
the
north
side
of
ship
island
under
the
land
we'd
cite,
the
island
now,
the
fort
now
sits
considerable
distance
out
into
the
water
on
one
side,
because
the
island
has
washed
away
to
that
extent.
also
ship
island
near
and
not
entirely
after
it's
drawn
on
this
map,
because
now,
that
this
map
would
go
--
in
1947,
a
hurricane
in
1947
cut
a
channel
and
cut
ship
island
in
two.
the
u.s.
told
from
geodetic
survey
charged
that
you
have
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
do
show
that
severance
in
our
island
and
so
that
there
was
a
complete
separation
of
the
island
here.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
the
american
legion
if
biloxi-owned
ship
island
now.
and
they
have
this
port
of
course,
which
they
have
somebody
i've
taken
care
of
ensure
impasses
by
through.
it's
also
a
concession
stand
out
there,
the
beach
which
is
frequently
used
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
island
here.
now,
there've
been
some
talk
about,
i
think
it
belongs
to
the
other
island,
they're
not
very
well
developed
as
yet.
but
people
did
go
out
there,
they're
not
even
going
to
live
out
there,
except
that
they
have
a
lighthouse
in
ship
island,
of
one
man
that
i
know
of,
who
lives
on
ship
island
was
all
who
takes
care
of
the
fort
out
there.
but
there
was
an
island
here,
in
1931
disappeared.
just
in
the
east
--
east
side
of
ship
island
here,
what
is
now
shown
here
in
coast
&
geodetic
survey
chart
in
our
brief,
there's
a
(inaudible)
right
in
this
point
here.
that
island
was
built
up.
it
had
been
developed
and
there
was
a
night
club
out
there
and
it
was
quite
a
tourist
attraction
for
--
for
a
great
many
years.
in
1930
and
1931,
the
island
finally
disappeared
and
that
allows
under
about
three
and
half
feet
of
water.
the
only
evidence
remaining
of
the
past
existence
of
the
island
here's
that
there's
now
a
--
an
artesian
well
pipe
that's
(inaudible)
water
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
also,
as
mr.
sachse
mentioned
yesterday,
timbalier
island
off
--
off
the
coast
of
louisiana
has
moved
some
nine
miles
in
the
last
number
of
years.
therefore,
we
contend
that
the
very
nature
of
the
islands
here,
that
islands
move
and
ship
from
place
to
place.
therefore,
definitely
positive
that
if
we
contend,
that
there
might
be
an
island
here,
next
week
or
next
year
off
and
seaward
of
these
islands
here.
and
it
must've
been
known
when
the
boundary
was
--
was
described
in
the
early
days.
when
la
salle
came
over
and
claimed
louisiana
for
the
--
province
of
louisiana
for
france,
he
claimed
all
the
--
the
seas
and
the
bays
and
(inaudible)
and
whatnot
and
the
ports
south
of
the
--
of
the
river
mississippi.
he
must
have
sailed
in
this
area
around
here
and
determined
the
nature
of
these
islands
here.
and
by
the
same
token
in
1699,
when
iberville
came
over
and
settled
here
at
biloxi
in
1699,
he
also
ought
to
find
(inaudible)
on
dolphin
island,
which
is
over
in
--
another
sand
island
over
here
in
off
the
coast
of
alabama.
he
stayed
there
for
23
years
before
moving
on
to
the
--
what
is
now
about
the
area
of
new
orleans,
city
of
new
orleans.
therefore,
he
must
have
known
precisely
of
where
these
islands
--
what
can
--
what
type
of
islands
they
were.
furthermore,
when
king
george
issued
his
proclamation
of
1763
on
which
we
tie
our
six
leagues
boundary
to.
when
he
got
this
land
in
obsession,
he
divided
into
the
provinces
of
east
and
west
florida.
this
part
of
mississippi
here
below
the
31st
parallel,
is
a
part
of
what
was
west
florida.
he
described
west
florida
in
his
proclamation
as
south
of
mississippi
territory,
which
was
in
31st
parallel,
east
of
mississippi
river
and
west
of
the
perdido.
therefore,
this
area,
all
in
here,
was
in
that
--
that
area
and
he
established
this
line
that
six
leagues
from
shore.
he
must
have
known
himself
what
the
nature
of
the
islands
were.
i
can
find
no
way
at
all
to
tell
now
where
precisely
the
islands
were
in
those
days,
back
in
the
old
days
of
king
george
and
so
forth.
there's
no
way
out
to
tell
where
they
are.
and
we
must,
i
think,
concede
that
island
shift
and
move
and
certainly
if
a
week
or
a
year
after
king
george
occupied
the
area
and
divided
this
--
this
two
provinces
of
east
and
west
florida
here,
he
must
have
--
he
must
have
realized
that
if
an
island
appeared
further
out
in
this
--
if
this
was
a
chain
existing
then,
that
surely
he
would
have
reached
out
beyond
that
and
got
in
the
island
beyond
there.
and
by
the
same
token,
i
believe,
as
what
the
united
states
in
the
enabling
act
set
the
boundary
of
six
leagues
from
shore.
if
an
island
had
appeared,
most
assured,
they
would
have
claimed
that
island
out
there
as
a
part
of
the
united
states,
because
it
would
then
be
in
--
within
the
six
leagues
boundary
line
from
the
gulf
--
from
the
shoreline.
this
king
george's
proclamation
of
1763
came
on
down
from
that
time
after
dividing
the
two
provinces
of
east
and
west
florida.
west
florida
then
was
seated
all
the
way
down
the
line
just
as
west
florida.
the
boundary
line
was
established
and
through
the
whole
chain
of
conveyance,
we
--
it
came
down
to
us
as
west
florida
under
the
louisiana
purchase.
if
the
court
please,
there's
one
thing
i'd
like
to
close
with
is
the
federal
government
position
in
this
case
that
national
policy
has
already
been
started
before
the
defendant
states
came
into
the
union.
and
that
limited
the
boundary
three
miles
from
coast
and
a
state
boundary
on
the
submerged
lands
act
on
this
is
limited
by
the
national
boundaries.
the
question
i
have
is
this.
it
seems
that
by
language
and
by
that
attitude
that
the
federal
government
says
that
the
government
takes
the
position
that
by
passing
this
submerged
lands
act
by
congress
and
by
the
president's
approval
of
that
act
by
congress,
then
that
it
would
turn
in
chief,
this
was
april's
fool
joke
played
in
may
on
the
gulf
coast
states.
you've
got
to
give
some
meaning
to
the
three-league
provision
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
we
don't
believe
we
can
challenge
the
sincerity
of
a
good
faith
of
congress
and
the
president
in
putting
that
proviso
in
our
submerged
lands
act.
it
must
be
given
some
meaning
by
this
court.
it
means
something,
else
why
did
they
put
it
in
there.
let's
go
to
our
rule
of
the
statutory
construction
as
outlined
here
in
the
joint
brief
of
the
states
on
page
37.
we
cited
this
court
an
ex
parte
public
national
bank
of
new
york,
it
says,
“no
rule
to
statutory
construction
has
been
more
definitely
stated
or
more
often
repeated
than
the
cardinal
rule
that
significance
and
effect,
shall,
if
possible,
be
accorded
to
every
word.”
as
already
--
breaking
the
abridgment
to
section
2
was
said
that,
“a
statute
off
upon
the
whole
to
be
construed.”
that
if
it
cannot
--
if
it
can
be
prevented,
no
clause,
sentence
or
word
shall
be
superfluous,
void
or
insignificant.
they
read
a
meaningless
thing
into
this
thing
of
this
--
of
the
three-league
boundary,
three
provisions
set
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
if
we
had
no
form
about
this,
there'd
be
no
foreign
boundary
every
established
by
any
act
of
congress,
only
by
prejudice.
and
if
it's
necessary
to
do
so,
i
think
this
court
should
hold
that
the
submerged
lands
act
establishes
national
boundary.
that
is
not
a
part
of
this
case
however.
and
i
will
quickly
show
that
mississippi
does
not
claim
any
territorial
sea
or
any
territorial
waters,
we
claim
only
submerged
lands
under
the
waters,
out
of
the
six-league
boundary
line.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
as
matter
of
national
policy
talks
about
in
foreign
policy
by
the
united
states
and
his
argument
is,
it
distresses
time
and
time
and
time
again
is,
that
our
foreign
policy
was
three
miles,
only
three
miles.
they
were
--
the
--
the
debates
were
voluminous
and
unending
almost
in
congress
about
this
act.
there
were
just
countless,
hundreds
and
thousands
of
figures
in
the
reports
about
this
thing
at
committee
hearings.
the
congress
knew
it
would
expose
of
what
our
national
policy
was.
the
president,
the
chief
executive
officer
have
known
what
the
secretary
of
state
would
do
and
certainly
he
can
act
only
for
the
executive.
they
--
if
there
was
a
national
policy,
they
knew
it
absolutely.
and
they
said
if
--
if
it
was
at
that
time,
the
act
must
mean
that
despite
that
fact
and
we
say
it
was
no
national
foreign
policy
of
three
miles
absolutely,
but
if
there
was,
they
said
that
we're
going
to
ignore
the
foreign
policy
if
we
must.
we're
going
to
give
the
states
out
to
--
if
they
can
prove
their
historic
claim
at
the
three
leagues
from
--
from
coast,
we're
going
to
give
that
much
out
there.
and
our
territory
was
that
we're
going
to
reserve
that
to
ourselves.
but
insofar
as
the
submerged
lands
and
not
the
resources
therein,
we're
going
to
give
that
to
the
states.
did
that
answer
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
i
don't
see
how
in
the
world
you
can
read
it
that
way
as
saying
the
moment
after
we
came
in
the
union.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
overstate
(inaudible)
your
honour.
mr.
john
h.
price,
jr.
thank
you.
