justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
again
that
it
means
the
same
as
though
it's
been
written
after
admission
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
is
that
a
proper
analogy
to
the
question
right
here
as
to
what
this
country
had
solved
when
it
absorbed
texas,
the
area
that
it
absorbed
is
that
a
correct
analogy?
can
you
argue
from
analogy
that
it
gave
up
certain
powers
of
government
thereafter?
but
it
necessarily
means
that
their
areas
shrank
up
in
some
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
1848
treaty
with
mexico
been
superseded
by
later
treaties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
still
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
boundary
lines
between
us
and
mexico
is
nine
miles
from
our
coast.
is
the
boundary
line
of
mexico
--
does
it
come
within
nine
miles
of
our
coast,
if
this
language
is
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
republics?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
there's
a
goods
deal
more
of
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and
this
says
that
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
republics
so
it
meant
from
the
gulf
of
mexico,
three
leagues
from
land.
i
presume
if
our
boundary
goes
to
three
leagues
was
the
accept
boundary
that
many
have
said.
but
that
boundary
line
comes
to
within
three
leagues
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
--
i
read
that
what
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
if
that
is
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
republics,
it
means
i
suppose
to
give
it
its
actual
meaning
that
mexico
owns
the
gulf
all
the
way
to
nine
miles
with
our
shores
and
we
own
it
nine
miles
outward
--
seaward.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
did
you
deny
it
on
the
ground
that
it
didn't
--
the
boundary
line
was
no
good
as
to
mexico,
but
was
good
as
to
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
it
be
equally
binding
on
both,
if
it's
binding
on
one
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
a
boundary
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
this
is
the
boundary
line,
what
i'm
saying
is,
i
don't
it
has
an
effect
on
it.
but
if
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
republics
is
nine
miles
from
our
shore
(inaudible)
then
the
boundary
line
of
mexico
was
at
the
same
time
up
to
that
value,
was
it
not,
if
you
--
if
you
want
to
construe
that
as
being
the
boundary
line
between
two
republics.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whatever
it
meant,
it
meant
the
same
for
both
countries,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
was
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
republics,
whatever
boundary
line
meant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
little
republic?
[laughter]
justice

black
mr.

is
that
on

whereas,
the

other

may
go

it
likes.

black
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
just
one
question.
you
--
the
compulsory
six
leagues,
is
it
your
idea
that
alabama
and
mississippi
have
six
leagues
from
their
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
solicitor
rankin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
deny
that
ground?
i
didn't
know
there
was
any
difference
between
here
on
that
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
they
were
saying
that
it
didn't
give
them
anything
because
it's
hard
that
they
had
those
boundaries
to
the
extent
they
talked
about
denying
the
three
leagues
and
therefore
nothing
was
given
by
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
were
--
the
right
they
had
in
it
and
the
power
over
it
and
the
ownership
of
it
were
simply
recognized.
i
thought
that
was
their
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
the
difference,
i
think
maybe
i
understand
it.
maybe
they
concede,
i
am
not
sure,
from
the
opinions
it
had
that
legally
the
state
did
not
own
it
at
that
time,
but
that
what
they
wanted
to
do,
congress
--
what
they
insisted
the
congress
should
do
was
to
grant
to
the
state
that
which
they
had
always
owned
or
claimed
to
own
the
authority.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand.
you're
not
telling
the
power
of
congress
to
give
one
state
more
than
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
rely
on
the
equal
footing
provision
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand,
but
what
you
are
saying
is
that
although
they
have
a
right
to
prove
it,
they
can't
prove
it,
because
they
said
it
was
the
legal
boundary,
and
the
court
had
already
established
the
legal
boundaries
of
three
leagues
at
--
at
one
--
three
--
three
miles.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
be
what
you're
arguing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
if
you
didn't
do
that,
are
you
--
are
you
urging
that
although
the
court
had
not
decided
that
the
legal
boundaries
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
was
three-mile,
that
is
the
truth
that
no
evidence
can
be
offered
in
dispute
that
legal
truth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then,
may
i
ask?
there
was
no
boundary,
no
legal
boundary
or
that
there
never
was
any.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference
between
here
then?
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
they
did
have
a
provision
before
the
act
went
in
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
they
had
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
for
nine
miles.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
that
does
not
represent
the
--
did
not
represent
the
boundary
at
that
time
to
which
congress
was
referring,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
what?
because
of
what
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
how
could
--
how
would
it
be
possible
for
them
to
prove
to
do
that
if
congress
has
said
some
of
the
states
might
be
able
to
do
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
they
couldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
impossible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
understand
that
you're
arguing
it's
not
possible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
protection?
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
what
was
the
protection
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
will
come
on
boundary
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
more
than
three
miles?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
you
reading?
page
136?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
not
in
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
particular
boundary
(inaudible)?
what
was
the
(inaudible)?
justice

black
you're

justice

is
there
anything
(inaudible)?
justice

black
that
was
more
than
a
texas
boundary
act,
wasn't
it,
it
was
a
texas

mexico
boundary
act?
justice

so
mexico
on

gulf
up
to
nine
leagues
of
texas.
justice

they
have
protested?
justice

you.

have
you
joined
the

on

statement,
as
i
understand
it,
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
state
entered
the
union?
justice
hugo

black
do
you
mean
that
you
join
the
issue
on
saying
if
the
boundary
or
assertion
of
boundaries
now
that
the
state
has
(inaudible),
but
it
doesn't
--
the
boundary
of
the

is
not
decided
by
what
it
was
indeed
before
it
came
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
--
do
you
deny
that
the
argument
they
--
they
made
is
up
to
the
(inaudible)
the
state
of
texas
came
into,
that
it
accepted
as
a
state,
that
it
did
have
a
boundary
of
three
leagues
(inaudible),
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
hugo

black
do
you
concede
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
deny
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
am
not
talking
--
justice

black
--
about
the
--
after
it
was
entered
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
prior
to
its
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
our
policy
have
governed
texas
as
a
republic?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
it
--
could
it
have
fixed
--
could
our
policy
prevent
mexico
from
having
whatever
you
pointed
out
in
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
if
it
has
powers
of
preventing
it
from
doing
it,
but
as
a
question
of
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
because
of
our
policy,
no
nation
in
the
world
had
a
right
to
have
more
than
three
miles
out
of
their
boundary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
united
states
won't
recognize
but
i
am
--
justice
hugo

black
--
talking
about
the
republic
of
texas

the
republic
of
mexico
or
some
other
country.
justice
hugo

black
what
--
what
would
be

what
would
--
what
was
the
boundary?
what's
the
boundary
within

justice

black
that's
the
law
as
we
say
it.
justice
hugo

black
three
miles
and
three
leagues.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
wouldn't
stand
on
what
we
say
in
california
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
--
i
am
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
rather
interested
in
the
argument
so
far
that
everything
has
been
said
relates
to,
i
presume,
what
was
(inaudible)
judicial
knowledge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
takes
the
position
that
it's
entitled
to
the
judgment,
but
the
other
side
takes
(inaudible).
i
assume
that
if
the
other
is
right
and
you
are
wrong
about
the
interpretation
of
law
as
it
--
as
it
existed
at
the
time,
that
it's
exceedingly
important,
at
least
on
one
decision
of
that
case
as
to
whether
the
government
has
any
proof
or
would
have
any
proof
that
before
texas
became
a
state,
it
did
not
assert
and
claim
as
its
boundary
the
three
leagues
into
the
gulf,
is
there
any
dispute
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
time
it
became
a
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
did
it
present
that
boundary
to
the
congress
as
its
boundaries
at
the
time
it
became
a
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
a
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
was
urged
within
the
quarter?
did
the
--
was
the
report
made
the
congress
of
what
the
boundaries
of
texas
were
claimed
to
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
did
the

say
(inaudible)?
justice

of
your

black
(inaudible)
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice

oh,
but
as
to
the
maritime
--
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
we'll
recess
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
then
(voice

the
boundary
be
adjusted
as
were
we
adjust
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
were
these
boundaries
diminished?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
during
--
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
government
instead
of
this
other
man
on
the
basis
of
his
direct
superior
in
mexico
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
stated
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
--
what
about
this
man
--
it
was
not
rightfully
and
properly
in
texas
that
was
taken
away
from
the
--
from
this
boundary
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
authority
from
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
the
title
derived
from
for
the
united
states
to
do
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
what
i
thought
you've
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
--
what
i
understand
in
your
and
i
want
to
see
it
around
this
case.
i
understand
that
you're
talking
yourself
into
a
policy
of
the
government,
you
said
the
effective
law
you
keep
calling
it
international
law,
but
i
assume
international
law
recognized
that
this
country,
that
would
be
recognized.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
more,
and
that
under
that,
could
be
no
more
than
three
miles
under
the
sea.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
while
we
had
said
that
didn't
have
--
you're
not
looking
at
this
part
of
the
map.
we
had
said
that
in
reference
to
the
government
part
of
it.
i
understand
you
say
the
gulf
and
we
treat
it
separately,
and
yet
your
argument
is
that
it's
so
much
of
a
problem,
is
it
--
it's
so
elite
that
you
might
say
so,
so
contrary
to
our
--
what
the
law
would
allow.
that
we
must
read
into
the
admission,
a
diminution
of
its
power
by
reason
of
that
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
government
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
we
meant
it
when
we
said
it
--
it
meant
that
the
three-mile
policy
what
difference
would
that
make,
insofar
as
this
act
is
concerned?
will
it
change
the
interpretation
of
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
argument
is
drawn
at
the
same
line,
but
the
argument
is
made
on
the
national
policy,
three
miles.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
now
are
willing
to
say
that
refers
to
the
government,
that's
what
you're
saying,
is
that
same
policy
was
taken
there
and
the
whole
country
should
be
applied
to
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wasn't
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
you
had
indicated,
but
the
--
i
don't
think
that
fact
is
here.
what
if
--
more
or
less,
this
case
is
not,
but
its
political
serving,
it
had
a
state
policy
which
inferred
to
heretofore
the
general
conversation
that
now
we
should
be
afforded
the
first
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
congress
used
or
is
it
acted
in
there,
i'm
not
arguing
in
everything
(inaudible)
points
out.
so
that
congress
knew
so
far
as
our
case
is
concerned,
what
do
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
but
those
opinions
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore
you,
just
have
been
said
it
was
a
general
policy
against
setting
it
more
than
three
miles
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
it
was
the
fact
that
this
court
meant.
notwithstanding
that
it
indicated
as
i
understand
the
use
that
you
conceive.
that
it
showed
the
purpose
to
those
that
had
claimed
has
a
right
to
have
that.
that
it
shows
the
purpose
as
far
the
government,
so
let
states
have
it,
whatever
had
been
the
problem
at
hand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
that
those
arguments
meant
that
they
were
saying
even
though
there
is
--
has
been
(inaudible)
the
legal
three-mile
limit
--
we
are
going
to
pass
this
bill
and
congress
will
let
us
decide
where
there
has
been
a
three-mile
limit,
generally
speaking,
or
did
they
intend
to
say
that
to
that
regard,
there
was
an
(inaudible)
some
kind
of
inspection
should
be
made
to
see
what
boundary
that
the
states
--
the
boundary
that
the
states
were
when
they
came
in
or
what
it
going
to
prove
thereat
and
let
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
went
--
they
went
on
the
basis
as
congress
acted
on
the
basis
but
(inaudible)
when
they
said
they
would
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
give
them
a
chance
to
prove
what
they
--
what
they
had
historically
claimed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
evidence
is
met
by
that
is
the
one
who
had
this
boundary
whatever
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
to
their
argument
that
congress
has
set
them
into
the
defining
of
legal
boundary
before
i
had
this
one,
referring
--
by
referring
on
the
(inaudible)
but
you
--
which
can
be
utilized
to
determine
how
much
you'd
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that's
denying.
i
assume
their
statement
is
denying.
one
of
these
claims
was
that
to
deal
automatically,
granting
texas
three
miles
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
you're
saying
then
to
the
court
--
as
you're
saying
to
that
the
power
of
the
court
grants
--
but
(inaudible)
is
to
say
that
under
the
courts
of
(inaudible)
has
legal
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
suppose
that
they're
only
saying
the
boundaries
--
they
without
regard
and
they
want
to
be
--
they
want
to
be
--
asking
that
such
legal
boundaries
and
now,
i'm
just
stating
the
claims
and
had
--
only
through
the
years
that
congress
had
(inaudible).
in
that
regard,
you'd
be
now
(inaudible)
on
the
basis
of
legality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
i
gather,
the
state
say
from
--
well,
some
i
want
change
the
wrong.
assuming
they
were
right,
except
nevertheless,
they
wanted
that
others
didn't
have
to
do
it.
they
end
(inaudible)
and
make
that
feel
fine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
for
the
long
--
but
after
they
had
on
their
boundaries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
long
standing
claim
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
asking
the
senator
he
might
have
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
everything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
indicate
they
could?
justice
hugo
l.
black
exactly
put
this
in
alabama.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
congress
--
they
can
prove
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
all,
you're
being
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
true
about
granting
to
the
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

do
you
think
the
proponent
including
the
president
of
the
united
states
were
heightened
to
the
boundary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
side
of
that
legal
question,
as
you
have
asserted.
what
legal
(inaudible)
congress
admitted
by
wanting
it
all
together
and
have
the
greatest
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
want
you
to
matter
if
congress
determines
what
matters
in
great
(inaudible)
unless
the
legal
question
you
have
argued
is
involved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effects
are
they?
in
other
words,
when
you
said
facts,
the
statute
--
that
doesn't
--
you
have
to
--
have
to
submit
that
in
the
court
to
decide
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
mean
to
decide
that
there
is
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
statute
--
you
think
what's
wrong
about
it,
but
there's
nothing
at
all,
you
either
pass
on

justice

what
do
congress
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
100
to
150
years

in
mississippi
lawyer.
justice

black
mr.
sachse,
do
you
have
a
separate
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
for
louisiana
(voice

--
justice

l.
black
so
that's
just
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
louisiana
has
joint
reply
briefs
and
statements
filed
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
two
briefs
you
have.
justice

is
that
the
crucial
point
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
your
question
as
we
had
in
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
louisiana
is
claiming
three
leagues
from
coast
or
three
leagues
from
the

island,
which
is
included
in
the

what
state
is
that?

l.
black
where
is
the
united

versus
texas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
162?
justice
hugo
l.

so
that
they
were
granting
the
land
after
(inaudible)
why
didn't
they
(inaudible)
and
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
arguing
that
by
reason
of
that
statement,
the
land
--
the
act
itself,
grants
louisiana
the
three
leagues.
justice

which
map?
justice

i
looked

is

justice

yes.
i

i
(inaudible)
justice

yes.
justice

are
we

102,
i
take
it.
justice

but
what's
the

justice

how
was
it
treated
in
the
--
in
the
louisiana
and
mississippi
case
of
the
paragraphs
one
and

justice

black
maritime
boundary
in
the
louisiana
against
mississippi.
i
understood
you
to
say,
yes
there,
did
you
not?
justice

and
the
government
in
reliance
as
having
decide
to
maritime
boundary
of
the
u.s.
(inaudible)
justice

black
the
national
maritime
boundary.
justice

suppose
congress
had
just
decided
that
the
states
would
have
boundaries
after
certain
(inaudible)
even
though
it
had
set
the
boundary
(inaudible)
suppose
they
decided
that
(inaudible)
justice

on
any
ground
at
all,
whether
you
do
the

things

equality
of

has
been

any
constitutional

is

constitutional
(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice

black
yes,
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
in
the
argument
of
their
counsel
was
raised.
that's
just
your
point
and
at
least
a
very,
very,
very
great
difficulty
in
determining
as
a
matter
of
judicial
policy
where
the
boundary
is.
suppose,
i
wanted
to
give
the
conclusion
that
they
had
not
definitely
determined
them
and
just
as
so
vague
that
you
couldn't
say
what
they
had
done,
what
should
be
done
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
legal
boundaries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
--
of
shore
or
coast
or
this
concept
between
the
coast
and
the
shore
and
that
has
been
raised
(inaudible)
it's
your
position,
is
it,
that
congress
does
have
--
that
if
congress
had
deliberately
concluded
that
despite
the
equal
states
and
despite
the
general
idea
of
the
three-mile
boundary
that
it
shall
be
at
a
certain
place
that
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
something
awkward,
don't
you
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
boundary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
wasn't
completed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
recall
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
considerable
difficulty
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
the
efforts
you
make.
are
you
sure
that
a
surveyor
without
legal
rule
announced,
the
government
policy
with
this
in
reference
to
coast
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
rules
should
be
announced
by
congress,
as
--
as
i
gather
from
you
(inaudible)
on
what
some
people
would
say
would
be
an
arbitrary
(inaudible)
at
this
country
or
whatever
(inaudible)
wanted
to
claim
50
miles
out
into
the
sea
or
45
or
60.
and
if
that
were
done
by
the
country
would
certainly
prevent
the
binding
on
the
shores
or
to
this
except
into
the
policies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
have
gone
far
enough
has
they
not
ant
indicate
it
that
certainly
the
three-mile
limit,
which
was
considered
to
be
a
(inaudible)
need
not
be
(inaudible)
in
the
gulf
hence,
their
conditions
drawing
with
--
it
could
be
nine
months.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
use
the
word
“legal
boundary”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
arguing
as
i
looked
at
it
on
the
basis
of
whatever
had
been
the
policy
and
whatever
was
the
law,
in
some
way,
some
of
these
states
are
always
ought
to
have
more
rights
than
they
have
been
given
out
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
has
just
the
connection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
that
--
that
they
just
had
--
they
were
determined
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
nation
(inaudible)
look
into
this
and
see
if
it
had
to
be
readjusted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
between
all
of
the
states,
the
same?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
in
the
gulf
or
all
over
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
say
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
rankin,
with
reference
to
louisiana,
which
is
before
us,
let's
assume
that
your
argument
that
you're
heretofore
making
with
reference
to
neutralization
of
--
of
(inaudible)
may
i
ask,
why
don't
you
try
to
reach
the
three-mile
limit,
that's
the
judgment,
let's
assume.
let's
assume
that
--
that's
some
kind
of
fact
here
and
we
don't
know
exactly
yet
what
kind
it
would
be,
that's
enough
to
cause
texas
to
be
recognized
and
(inaudible)
receive
a
grant.
now,
when
we
come
to
louisiana,
when
did
again
that
you
said
several
times
that
thing
here
that
have
to
be
considered.
i
presume
that
include
this
kind
of
a
burden,
although
i
don't
like
to
argue
it,
i'm
trying
to
get
out
of
the
assumption
with
the
burden.
but
somebody
has
to
do
something,
something
has
to
be
shown,
some
kind
of
evidence.
let's
assume
that
was
enough
but
before
the
texas
came,
the
republic
of
texas
at
this
boundary.
now,
we
had
louisiana.
what
do
you
say
on
the
policy
of
the
law,
the
policy
of
congress
expressed
by
the
law
(inaudible)
which
would
justify
denying
to
louisiana
the
same
right
as
to
be
held
to
be
acquainted
in
texas
view
the
fact
that
they
did
treat
for
a
long
time
the
idea
of
three-league
even
though
not
in
language
(inaudible),
if
it
talk
about
three
leagues,
three
leagues
that
the
map
was
on
three
leagues
out
from
something
of
what
--
why
should
louisiana
not
be
entitled
to
the
same
privilege
that
texas
--
that
texas
isn't
entitled
and
now,
we're
on
louisiana.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
criteria?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
they
--
why
should
they
not
be
entitled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
it
say
otherwise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
--
how
could
--
i
read
that
notion,
how
could
you
determine
what
a
state
boundary
would,
except
by
the
custom,
condition
in
their
claim
that
if
possible,
the
language
when
they
came
in,
i'll
just
read
again,
the
language
in
the
statute
as
to
louisiana.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
it
does
refer
to
islands
within
three
leagues.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
while
others
give
them
the
island,
it
wouldn't
--
that
the
--
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
why
if
they
got
the
island
and
texas
were
--
held
that
texas
had
the
right
because
it
had
claimed
after
it,
everybody
knew
it
(inaudible)
why
would
louisiana
--
why
should
she
be
denied
the
same
logic
or
whatever
it
is
or
policy
of
consideration
or
policy
of
congress
to
conclude
that
the
national
interest
require
that
this
primers
be
heard
and
listened
to
and
action
be
taken
by
the
political
agent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
through
the
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
admissible
as
evidence,
is
it
not?
or
is
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
a
judicial
question
to
be
determined,
what
do
we
have
unless
--
unless
we
require
an
expert,
would
you
say?
my
question
is
not
asked
on
the
basis
that
i
--
for
you
against,
but
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
court
must
hear
or
have
to
hear
in
order
to
take
a
judicial
determination
to
determine
what
is
legal
when
nobody
gets
that
out
whether
it'd
be
--
either
in
an
act
of
congress
or
by
them.
why
not
the
claims
of
the
states
through
the
years
before
they
were
admitted
and
at
the
time
for
it
and
even
after
it,
why
was
those
not
become
pieces
of
evidence
to
be
considered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
legal
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
gather
that
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
it.
i
have
considerable
to
do
with
the
other
cases
but
i
gather
that
congress
had
an
idea,
when
it
attached
with
it,
maybe
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
wasn't
a
thing
to
stand
on
that
there
was
certain
history
from
it
and
that
congress
would
take
a
new
look
at
it
then
they
--
put
--
when
you
look
at
it
and
turn
over
some,
i
do
not
know
how
much,
to
us
but
can
you
just
face
it
all
on
their
premise
that
congress
was
interested
in
nothing
but
the
--
the
unclear
letter
of
the
law
as
to
what
was
the
boundary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it
hasn't
been.
it
hasn't
been
interpreted
the
other
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
there's
anything
to
be
said
that
i
don't
(inaudible)
you
could
take
out
any
isolated
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
indicated,
the
bill
that
is
indicated
--
it
wouldn't
satisfy
the
law
as
we
had
written
it
in
the
california
case.
it
is
not
on
constitutional
ground
but
we
had
written
this
law
in
a
certain
way.
this
bill
indicates
that
so
far
as
the
application
of
(inaudible)
the
gulf,
there
was
still
that
fraction
of
the
gulf.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
did
desire
to
change
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
to
begin
here
or
--
or
was
that
wrong?
because
they
--
this
indicate
the
purpose
of
(inaudible)
gulf
differently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they've
indicated
here
is
that
there's
somebody
maybe
entitled
the
nine
miles
out,
all
of
it.
and
of
course,
in
order
to
make
a
judicial
question,
it
would
have
to
give
some
criteria
but
what
have
they
given?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
use
the
word
“legal
boundaries”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
presume
the
republic
of
texas
had
--
had
that
boundary.
maybe
it
wasn't
a
big
enough
republic
say
that
in
particular.
but
maybe
it
wasn't
a
big
enough
republic
to
maintain
its
assertion
but
it
--
it
had
the
assertion
in
the
claim
and
if
it
has
the
power
to
maintain
it,
i
guess
that
would
be
its
boundary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
republic
of
texas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
international
law
doesn't
govern
a
nation
unless
it
wants
to
be
governed
by
so-called
international
law
and
if
it
wants
to
be
govern
by
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
do
not
yet
have
any
dreams
of
that
(inaudible)
we
do
not
yet
have
any
international
law
that
is
binding
on
all
of
the
nations
which
can
be
enforced
like
the
law
of
--
of
the
united
states.
and
if
the
republic
of
texas
asserts
a
formula
to
maintain
or
the
republic
of
mexico
or
the
--
any
other
countries,
long
enough
to
maintain
a
certain
claim
but
what
--
how
would
they
support
if
they
do
not
run
the
policy
of
the
nation
as
to
upset
that
boundary
line
which
they
asserted
it
was
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
perhaps
it
finally
matters
as
every
government
has
that
--
which
it
asserts
it
then
and
can
protect
by
force
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
is
the
real
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that's
a
different
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
well,
they
could
maintain
it
by
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
expressing
myself
with
reference
to
that
policy
several
times.
i
don't
think
that
[laughs]
it's
quite
as
different
between
our
ideas
and
good
policy.
here,
we
have
this
statute.

is
it
your
judgment
that
the
rights
of

the
effect
from

that

mississippi
could

some

way
rather

by
taking
judicial
(inaudible)
do
you
think
the
result
depends
on

over
evidence?
justice

black
i
suppose
someone
disagreed

do
you

other?

do
you
have
any
that

it
(inaudible)

that
is
to
be
that
you
have
the
statements
in

not
set
forth
(inaudible)
justice

another
question
is,
suppose
(inaudible)
exercising
its
undoubted
power

sets
forth
those
sufficient
criteria
to
govern
the

legal
determination,
what
would
you
say
then?

you
claim
there
is
sufficient
here.

would

even

do

and
is
that
what
florida
is
relying
on
in

justice

constitution
of

kind,

you
--
justice

black
did
the
other
--
justice

black
--
state
constitutions
submitted
to
congress
would
mean
the
boundaries?
justice

l.
black
what
--
what
number
is
that
document?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it
that
related
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
any
mean
a
part
of
that
involved
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
a
discussion
in
the
congress
on
the
submerged
land
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
this
particular
clause
of
that
bill
of
the
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
this
clause
in
the
bill
which
refer
to
boundary
that
have
been
approved
by
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
no,
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
so
far
as
the
boundary
described
referred
to
the
perdido
river?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
before
me
the
constitution
of
alabama
approved
by
the
--
the
same
act
so
far
as
described.
and
this
refers
at
the
beginning
of
perdido
river
(inaudible)
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
to
shore.
that
was
approved
at
the
same
time,
wasn't
it?
do
you
know
whether
the
two
--
either
one
of
the
two
was
struck
by
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
is
up
but
you
go
right
ahead
for
a
short
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
afraid
senator,
your
time
has
expired
up
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
stop
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
swarth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
could
then
possibly
be
correct
so
far
as
the
second
clause
is
concerned
relating
to
or
--
which
has
been
approved
by
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
one
state
enter
the
bill
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
has
two,
there
is
an
alternative,
is
there
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
in
reference
to
that
clause,
the
question
is
more
likely
this,
whether
since
the
state
has
been
admitted
into
the
union.
congress
has
approved
the
boundary,
which
went
out
beyond
the
three-mile
limit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
you
think
it
means
limitation
that
congress
couldn't
have
approved
it
over
three
miles?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it
was
approved,
if
congress
--
if
it
could
be
shown,
and
let's
say
it
could,
indicated
one
way
or
the
other.
i
am
just
trying
to
get
your
position
of
what
you
said
there
to
show
that.
suppose
congress
had
expressly
approved
a
constitution
which
said
that
we
now
claim
more
than
three
miles
out,
we
claim
six
to
nine
miles
and
that
has
been
done
in
1850,
1890,
and
1910,
would
that
come
within
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it's
a
question
of
whether
it
has
been
--
whether
congress
has
approved
it
since.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
other
ones
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alabama
(inaudible)
in
its
constitution
from
the
one
that
i
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
drawing
a
distinction
between
florida's
rights
and
opinion
it
had
under
its
reconstruction
constitution
and
alabama's
rights,
if
it
doesn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
gulfs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
likelihood
in
the
descriptions
of
the
entrances
on
the
gulf
coast?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
were
there
divergences
or
were
those
all
six
leagues
of
spanish
grant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
think
that
in
this
view
of
the
reconstruction
act
which
require
the
states
to
admit
constitutions
for
examination
and
approval.
and
bear
in
mind
as
after
they
did,
someone
will
submit
it
in
the
boundary
which
you
say
may
have
increased
the
boundary
that
it
had
and
also
assuming
the
validity
of
the
submerged
lands
act
which
provides
that
if
congress
has
approved
a
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
what
is
--
how
do
you
answer
the
argument
that
these
states
shall
have
the
extension
of
boundaries
approved,
assuming
that
--
that
there's
no
constitutional
violation
in
either
the
submerged
lands
act
or
reconstruction
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
attack
the
constitutionality
if
either
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
you
know
there
were
very
stronger
text
made
on
the
constitutionality
of
those
acts
on
the
basis
that
the
states
had
never
been
out
of
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
attack
--
you
do
not
attack
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
right
of
congress
to
require
a
new
constitution.
require
its
complete
approval
by
congress
as
--
as
a
valid
action
of
congress.
you
do
not
attack
its
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
with
which
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
act,
i
don't
know
why,
i
am
in
the
dark
to
that.
but
the
act
specifically
require,
there
was
an
act
which
specifically
required
them
to
submit
a
constitution
for
approval.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
specifically
submitted
the
constitutions
for
approval.
justice
hugo
l.
black
among
the
other
things
that
were
--
were
in
those
constitution
were
the
description
of
the
boundaries
of
the
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wasn't
--
why
wasn't
that
an
approval
by
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
approve
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
one
of
the
bill,
wasn't
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
using
language
of
this
act
of
1968
there
before
you
concede
that
it
did
not
approve.
justice

it

some
were

understood

accept

views
that
the

they
were
out.
they've

vetoed,
refusing

there'd
be,
write
new

that

what
i
understood

what
i
understood
to
be
the
history
of
the

of
the
reconstruction
congress

the
purposes
of
those
who
required

it
had
been

out
of
the
union
they
were
still
in
the
union
when
time
of
their
representation.
the
others
took
the
view
that
they
forfeited
their
membership
in
the
union,
were
not
in
it
and
required
them
to
come
in
as
though
they
were
new
states
in
entirely.
i
think
that
was
the
--
the
line
of
debate
at
that
time
which
may
or
may
not
affect
this
but
it
causes
me
to
pause
in
connection
with
your
argument
as
to
what
they
meant
by
examination
and
approval
of
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
stevens,
thaddeus
stevens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
not
attacking
the
law
on
the
ground
of
this
question
--
on
the
ground
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
of
the
state
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
who
--
do
you
happen
to
know
who
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
view
of
the
fact
that
some
or
the
other
went
over
that
time.
i
see
no
reason
why
you
shouldn't
have
few
minutes
beyond
this
time
if
you
need.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let's
suppose
that's
precisely
correct,
congress
come
to
(inaudible)
that
you
say
it
is
and
says
that
congress
heretofore
approved
the
certain
thing,
then
that
should
be
recognized,
that's
it's
about.
how
--
what
you
have
read
in
that
--
the
application
among
that
act,
that
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
agree
--
you
would
make
that
as
a
broad
statement
that
if
just
didn't
mean
anything,
didn't
mean
any
approval
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
--
because
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
congress
had,
pursuant
to
an
act,
which
said
that
the
constitution
should
be
examined
and
approve
by
them,
that
said,
you
can
come
on
and
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
power
that
you
can
have
that
was
similar
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
invoke
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
this
is
a
very
important
case
and
if
there
is
anything
particular
that
any
of
you
wish
to
call
our
attention
to
in
a
short
brief
or
anything
it
would
be
all
right
on
either
sides.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
