mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
although
the
states
believe
firmly
that
the
concept
of
boundary
is
not
to
be
governed
by
foreign
policy
or
the
united
--
or
the
united
states'
particular
notion
of
international
law.
they
say
that
if
you
do
meeting
the
solicitor
general
directly,
if
you
look
at
general
international
law
and
at
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
international
law
at
the
critical
dates
that
these
--
that
that
law
that
supports
the
state
boundaries
at
least
three-leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
rather
than
denies
that.
i
point
out
to
you,
your
honors,
that
the
main
brief
of
the
government
states
that
these
boundaries
never
had
any
validity
under
international
law
or
the
law
of
the
united
states.
that
statement
was
repeated
this
morning
by
the
solicitor
general.
but
in
his
brief,
in
his
reply
brief
on
page
3,
he
conceded,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
precise
--
his
precise
contention
was
that
this
limitation
on
boundary
arises
solely
from
the
international
position
of
the
united
states
regardless
of
what
may
have
been
general
international
law.
now,
we
have
presented
to
the
court
the
opinions
of
professor
(inaudible)
of
california
and
that
we
think
the
leading
--
british
sea
law
expert,
professor
columbus
and
we
have
an
addition
to
that
presented
to
the
court
and
this
is
on
the
general
international
law
point.
a
tabulation
beginning
at
page
199
of
the
texas
brief
showing
by
opinions
of
publicists
and
diplomatic
correspondents
that
throughout
the
period
from
1763
to
1899,
three
leagues
was
mentioned
as
one
of
the
approved
limits
or
one
of
the
possible
limits.
we
challenge
directly,
specifically,
the
contention
of
the
united
states
that
the
united
states
has
never
at
any
time
for
150
years
as
the
solicitor
said
this
morning,
departed
from
its
present
conception
of
the
three-mile
limit.
it
seems
to
me
sir,
your
honors,
that
the
solicitor
general
has
--
is
--
is
trying
to
superimpose
on
the
first
half
of
the
united
--
of
the
19th
century
conceptions
as
to
the
content
of
the
territorial
sea
that
were
developed
in
the
last
half
of
the
19th
century.
and
that
order
--
in
order
properly
to
--
to
evaluate
this
case
and
congress
directed
the
court's
attention
to
the
state
of
international
law
and
if
you
will,
the
state
of
foreign
policy
determinations
of
the
united
states
if
it
be
conceded
arguendo
that
that
is
what's
wanted
to
control
this
case,
at
the
time
that
these
states
became
members
of
the
union.
if
they
had
intended
present
foreign
policy
to
control,
then
if
the
answer
was
simple,
but
they
said
at
the
time
that
they
entered,
that
determined
a
critical
date
and
an
earlier
time
in
the
progressive
development
of
international
law.
now,
may
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
development
then
of
this
policy
during
the
critical
period
from
1793
until
18
--
and
1868
when
florida's
boundary
was
approved
by
congress
and
direct
your
attention
to
that
period
regardless
of
what
--
as
later
said
about
that
period
--
look
--
let's
look
at
the
evidence
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
during
that
period.
mr.
jefferson's
letter
which
started
this
discussion
is
set
forth
on
page
77
of
the
joint
brief,
the
large
green
brief.
now,
he
simply
fixed
provisionally
in
all
premise,
he
simply
fixed
provisionally
the
area
of
the
--
of
adjacent
waters
in
which
the
--
the
infant
republic
would
undertake
to
protect
foreign
shipping
from
belligerent
acts.
he
recognized
in
the
course
of
that,
that
three
leagues
had
some
authority
even
then
at
that
--
in
its
favor
and
it
did,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
that
time
because
it
had
been
suggested
as
the
limit
to
the
members
of
the
continental
congress
who
negotiated
the
peace
treaty
with
great
britain.
now,
the
next
thing
we
did,
we
selected
--
we
--
we
implemented
his
policy,
but
we
also
declared
a
fully
custom
zone.
then,
when
we
got
up
in
the
early
part
of
the
--
of
the
19th
century,
the
problem
of
impressment
of
seamen
came
up.
it
was
a
critical
thing
ending
up
in
the
--
in
the
war
of
1812
as
you
know.
at
that
time,
mr.
jefferson
who
was
president,
just
preceding
the
war,
remembered
his
earlier
reservation
and
said
that
the
limits
of
the
united
states
for
protective
purposes
ought
to
be
the
gulf
stream
and
he
actually
made
such
a
--
a
tender
to
great
britain
at
that
time.
that
would
be
as
i
understand
it,
some
50
or
70
miles
off
the
coast
of
what
was
then
the
united
states.
now,
that
was
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states,
the
policy
of
broad
limits.
at
the
time
that
louisiana,
mississippi
and
alabama
joined
the
union,
then
attorney
general
gremillion
is
going
to
speak
--
he
will
speak
to
you
in
a
moment
about
the
special
physical
characteristics
of
the
gulf
of
mexico.
but
i
want
to
simply
point
out
here
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
a
very
shallow
gulf.
and
the
--
and
it
--
and
it's
physically
not
possible
and
this
was
recognized
throughout
the
early
part
of
the
19th
century.
it
was
not
physically
possible
for
ships
that
sail
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
to
approach
nearer
than
approximately
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
so,
the
policy
that
was
adopted
in
this
area,
which
i
will
submit,
is
a
reasonable
policy
based
on
that
physical
fact.
now,
what
did
the
united
states
do?
and
here,
i
wanted
to
draw
this
parallel
for
your
honors,
during
this
period.
first,
what
did
the
united
states
actually
do
and
what
i
think,
what
is
the
effect
of
the
government's
contention?
the
united
states
did
a
series
of
acts
during
this
period
with
specific
respect
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
that
it
didn't
do
any
place
else.
first
of
all,
it
admitted
four
states
with
enabling
acts
expressed
in
terms
of
leagues,
three
and
six
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
a
--
an
infant
republic,
republic
of
texas,
declared
a
boundary,
an
all
purpose
boundary
if
you
will,
three
leagues
at
sea.
there
was
no
protest
of
this
boundary
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
united
states
proceeded
to
recognize
that
boundary
and
then,
acquiesced
in
it
for
the
entire
life
of
that
republic
and
without
protest.
and
we
will
draw
parallel
in
a
moment
that
the
minute
a
--
a
statute
was
passed
in
russia
on
the
--
on
the
north
pacific,
the
united
states
was
quick
to
protest.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
i
think
the
solicitor's
point
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
physical
--
your
honor,
a
--
an
actual
recognition
in
terms.
my
point
is
that
the
recognition
is
a
recognition
by
acquiescence
when
protest
is
called
for,
if
they
objected
to
it.
and
that
has
been
their
policy.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
and
that
--
that
is
--
that's
policy.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
that's
correct.
and
that
--
and
that
has
certainly
been
our
history
in
the
latter
part
of
the
--
or
in
the
first
part
of
the
20th
century.
that's
--
it's
our
uniform
history,
but
it
was
not
the
policy
then.
now,
the
united
states
admitted
the
republic
was
--
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
yes,
sir.
i
think
we
speak
up
at
the
present
time
without
that.
but
we
didn't
then
and
congress
made
that
time
the
important
thing.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
we
began
to
--
we
--
we
began
to
speak
up,
sir,
beginning,
i
think,
in
about
1855
or
in
1862
and
then
again,
we
were
--
we
were
silent
for
a
while
and
then
we
began
to
speak
up
very
reciprously
after
we
lost
--
bearing
first
sea
law
arbitration
in
--
in
1893.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
i
haven't
--
i
haven't
studied
all
of
that,
but
my
--
my
answer
to
you
is
that
in
1882
for
example,
we
let
go
a
boundary,
a
three-league
boundary,
down
off
mexico
without
protesting,
even
though
it
was
communicated
to
us.
but
if
certainly
of
recent
years,
we've
been
very
consistent.
i
think
united
states'
present
policy
is
clear.
congress
knew
about
that.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
but
--
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
that
is
--
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
we
--
we've
certainly
objected
to
that
three
line
until
the
time
of
geneva
of
course,
we
made
this
tentative
suggestion.
now,
let's
--
let
me
direct
your
attention,
go
back
to
what's
going
on
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
down
there,
after
--
with
that
boundary
statute
on
the
books,
we
fought
a
war.
the
united
states
went
to
war
to
sustain
a
portion
of
that
boundary
and
president
polk
mentioned
that
boundary
act
in
his
warmest.
the
united
states
after
the
war
instructed
its
peace
commissioner
to
follow
that
boundary
act
in
the
peace
negotiations.
and
every
draft
from
the
secretary
of
state
furnished
domestic
trust,
directed
that
that
boundary
act
be
followed
and
it
was
specifically
referred
to.
we
have
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
which
it's
admitted
is
still
the
international
boundary
of
the
united
states.
you
--
your
honors
have
--
have
seen
the
map
that
appears
on
page
1
--
102
of
the
green
brief,
perhaps
at
page
102,
where
it
clearly
shows
that
as
recent
as
1912,
the
international
boundary
commission
stated
specifically
the
international
boundary
line
begins
three
leagues
at
sea.
i
don't
understand
that
the
solicitor
general
disputes
that.
thereby,
treaties
and
international
act
since
that
time,
that
boundary
is
the
present
boundary
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
--
mr.
tate
in
his
testimony
admitted
each
one
of
the
facts
that
i
have
just
stated
to
you
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the
boundary
at
the
time
and
that
for
that
reason,
these
acts
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
are
an
exception
to
the
general
policy
of
the
united
states
during
this
period.
and
he
also
regarded
the
florida
constitution
also
as
an
exception
to
the
united
states
during
that
period.
so,
we
have
a
series
of
acts
beginning
with
these
gulf
state
boundaries
occurring
during
this
period
that
relate
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
the
same
time
for
--
other
things
are
going
on.
now,
i
see,
the
solicitor
general
and
here's
on
the
other
hand,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
--
i've
given
you
the
evidence
for
it
as
i
see
it.
now,
here's
the
evidence
against
it
as
--
what
--
which
the
solicitor
general
brings
forward
to
us.
first
of
all,
he
adverts
to
a
treaty
with
algiers
in
which
we
agreed
with
the
day
of
algiers
that
he
would
--
we
--
he
would
protect
our
shipping
under
the
guns
of
his
corps.
it
seems
to
me,
that's
certainly
within
the
jefferson
policy
and
at
--
at
least
was
more
restricted,
it
was
appropriate
to
the
mediterranean
and
that's
fine,
it
doesn't
prove
anything
about
the
gulf
of
mexico.
next,
he
inversed
to
the
treaty
with
great
britain
in
1880,
now,
there's
a
wealth
of
diplomatic
correspondence
and
one
of
the
better
respites
that
john
quincy
adams
ever
had,
he
had
about
that
treaty.
but
the
full
effect
of
that
renunciation
has
to
be
understood
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
in
1883,
we
negotiated
and
got
far
on
the
northeast
coast,
the
right
to
fish
right
up
to
the
shores.
and
we
--
we
partitioned
that
right
with
great
britain.
after
the
war
of
1812,
great
britain
contended
that
the
right
had
been
terminated
by
the
war
and
that
we
had
no
further
right
to
fish.
the
--
at
the
treaty
at
--
at
against,
our
commissioners
refused
to
exit
to
that
claim.
shortly
thereafter,
our
--
our
vessels
were
stopped
60
miles
from
shore
and
we
--
and
we've
entered
into
negotiations
to
try
to
settle
this
matter.
frankly,
what
happened
was
a
compromise.
we
agreed
to
renounce
the
right
to
fish
three
miles,
the
narrowest
limit
we
could
get,
off
of
the
southern
part
of
that
coast,
coast
to
prince
edward
island,
in
exchange
for
the
right
to
fish
right
up
to
the
shores
on
the
coast
of
newfoundland
and
the
coast
of
what
is
now
labrador,
what
is
now
quebec.
if
this
thing
had
been
a
well
settled
principle
of
international
law,
you
would
have
seen
this
written
throughout
this
negotiation.
instead,
this
is
expressed
in
terms
of
a
compromise.
and
our
negotiator
says,
what
we
gave
up
was
the
area
where
fisheries
--
where
the
fisheries
were
not
in
favor
of
the
fisheries
we
were
interested
in,
the
crab
fisheries
which
were
farther
away
from
the
shore
than
nine
miles.
as
late
as
18
--
1887,
francis
wharton
of
the
state
department
recognized
that
this
was
a
policy
limited
to
the
northeast
coast.
it
was
born
and
compromised,
it
was
a
fight
that
ended
--
did
not
end
until
1910.
now,
the
next
thing
that
the
solicitor
general
brings
forward
is
the
controversy
over
the
russian
ukase
case
of
1821,
where
russia
announced
the
claim
to
exclude
fishing
and
exclude
any
contact
with
the
natives
from
--
for
100
miles
at
sea.
without
detailing
that
correspondence,
what
john
quincy
adams
simply
told
russia
was
that
100
miles
is
too
much.
that's
--
that's
an
inadmissible
claim,
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
set
a
boundary
at
a
reasonable
distance.
he
did
not
say
the
three
leagues
was
an
improper
boundary,
he
negotiated
for
and
got
the
right
for
american
fishing
to
go
up
to
the
shore
and
use
the
shore,
all
the
waters
of
the
pacific
except
where
there
were
settlers.
now
--
and
he
made
a
prompt
protest
to
that
boundary
at
that
suggestion
as
soon
as
it
came
to
his
attention.
now,
the
next
one
is
the
falkland
islands
controversy
in
1832.
this
correspondence
can
also
be
understood
only
by
careful
reading
of
it.
what
it
--
what
actually
--
the
united
states
was
--
was
complaining
about
was
the
fact
that
there
was
no
right
of
an
exclusive
fishery
on
a
desert
and
uninhabited
island.
they
had
--
they
said
they
had
--
had
been
enjoined
--
in
enjoyment
of
the
fisheries
for
50
years
and
they
used
the
shores,
they
used
all
parts
of
the
water.
and
here,
the
buenos
aires
government
was
excluding
them
without
notice.
and
they
complained
about
this
fishery,
but
what
they
--
they
actually
denied
what
is
the
concept
of
the
territorial
sea.
they
actually
said
that
the
only
purpose
that
any
sovereign
could
have
in
limiting
fishing
close
to
the
land
was
a
revenue
purpose.
now,
that's
not
fixing
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
it
seems
to
me.
now,
the
only
other
things
that
i
have
discovered
in
the
attorney
general
--
i
mean,
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
are
two
isolated
statements
dealing
with
the
territoriality
of
ships.
again,
they
are
not
fixing
boundary.
they
didn't
talk
of
sea
limits
in
any
of
this
discussion.
this
is
--
i
mean,
talk
of
boundary,
they
talked
in
terms
of
sea
limits.
and
the
jurisprudence
of
the
united
states
at
that
time
is
inverted
to
in
the
jefferson
letter,
near
the
end
of
it
that
the
states
were
the
competent
ones
to
fix
boundary,
or
congress
was
confident
to
fix
boundary,
but
congress
had
a
fixed
boundary.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
view
--
viewing
these
two
sides
of
the
coin
together,
you've
got
a
separate
policy
by
the
very
action
of
the
political
departments
of
the
united
states,
a
separate
policy
for
the
gulf
of
mexico
than
what
you
have
in
their
--
on
these
isolated
instance
is
that
each
of
these
other
isolated
instances
is
being
treated
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
specifically
for
that
purpose
without
any
intent
on
the
part
of
the
--
the
secretary
of
states
that
go
beyond
the
matter
in
which
he's
dealing
with.
now,
i'd
like
to
deal
for
one
minute
about
the
matter
or
the
situation
of
the
secretary
of
state
in
conclusiveness
of
the
statement
of
the
secretary
of
state
in
this
matter.
we
are
faced
here
for
the
first
time
to
my
knowledge
where
the
court
being
asked
to
take
the
word
of
the
secretary
of
state.
now,
the
present
secretary
of
state
as
to
what
policy
was
100
years
ago
and
what
the
intervening
policy,
we
do
not
doubt
that
the
secretary
of
state
has
the
right,
as
a
political
matter,
to
state
the
present
policy
of
this
government.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
for
the
rule
that
--
that
requires
this
court
to
--
and
this
court
has
held
it
requires
it
to
follow
the
policy
of
the
political
departments
is
completely
lacking
here.
what
are
the
reasons
that
are
assigned
for
that
rule?
first
of
all,
here,
the
sources
are
immediately
available.
the
same
source
is
available
to
this
court
as
available
to
secretary
of
states,
as
a
matter
of
historical
research.
there
is
no
objection
now
to
showing
diplomatic
correspondent,
that's
been
raised
in
some
cases.as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
itself
publishes
diplomatic
correspondence
15
year
--
up
to
15
years
ago.
the
facts
are
of
those
of
the
united
states'
own
position.
we're
not
having
to
build
into
the
--
and
the
foreign
correspondence
and
to
correspondence
of
the
british
government
and
--
and
get
documents
that
are
beyond
the
reach
of
this
court.
now,
finally,
and
with
specific
reference
to
what
the
solicitor
general
says,
i
--
it's
--
it's
my
position,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
clear
and
present
danger
that
if
this
court
finds
that
the
attorney
--
that
the
--
the
secretary
of
state
in
arguing
as
an
advocate
in
some
of
this
cases
in
the
past,
has
overstated
his
position
about
what
the
history
of
american
policy
is
that
there
will
be
any
objection
or
any
difficulty
created
in
--
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs
to
that
matter,
has
specifically
been
passed
on
by
congress,
congress
inquired
of
the
department
whether
whatever
it
did
in
this
area,
would
affect
the
conduct
of
the
present
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
and
secretary
--
and
the
assistant
legal
adviser,
mr.
jack
tate
said,
“no,
it
won't.”
furthermore,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
implicit
in
this
court's
holding
in
alabama
versus
texas
that
if
congress,
speaking
arguendo,
if
congress
had
granted
10
miles
to
some
state
--
nine
miles
to
some
states,
that
it
would
not
constitutionally
affect
the
conduct
of
the
american
foreign
policy.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
for
that
is
obvious.
the
three-mile
limit
is
a
--
is
a
limit
concerned
with
the
handling
of
the
waters
and
the
--
and
the
solicitor
general
and
--
and
with
rights
in
the
waters,
with
fishing
rights
in
the
waters.
and
essentially,
that's
what's
--
what
has
occurred.
and
actually,
it's
the
subsoil
rights.
the
question
of
the
subsoil
rights
has
been
removed
from
--
from
this
litigation
because
everybody
now
admits
that
the
united
states
owned
the
--
owns
these
and
the
state
department
admits
that
united
states
owned
these
rights
and
it
--
it
had
the
right
under
its
constitutional
power
to
convey
them
and
to
make
any
division
between
the
united
states
and
the
--
and
the
states
that
it
saw
fit
to
make.
now,
in
--
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
all
right.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
sir.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
sir,
the
--
if
i
have
your
question
correct,
i
do
not
understand
that
any
question
is
being
raised
about
the
title
of
the
united
states
to
rights
in
the
seabed,
in
subsoil,
in
the
area
in
controversy.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
i
claim,
sir,
that
if
--
if
the
word
boundary
here,
and
that's
what
of
course,
what
we're
all
struggling
with.
the
word
boundary
--
if
--
if
congress
showed
to
define
as
a
boundary
in
this
area,
an
area
outside
of
what
the
department
happens
at
the
moment
of
policy
could
claim
as
the
limits
of
territorial
water.
then,
congress
had
the
right
to
give
that
boundary
to
the
states.
and
i
--
and
i
say
that
the
history
of
the
act
shows
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
give
the
states
granted
in
where
--
well,
an
area
out
to
the
boundaries
that
they've
--
they
--
they
were
able
to
show
that
they
had.
and
it's
my
contention,
sir,
that
those
boundaries
are
on
effect
--
the
--
the
determination
if
you
will,
sir,
your
honor.
determination
of
that
question
needs
to
be
(inaudible)
by
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
foreign
policy
because
everybody
admits
and
admitted
throughout
the
legislation
of
congress
that
that
did
not
concern
the
matter.congress,
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
severed
paramount
rights
and
the
conduct
of
foreign
policy
from
property
rights
in
the
subsoil.
so,
congress
had
the
power
--
had
the
right
to
give
this
area.
and
--
and
so,
it's
--
it's
my
contention,
sir,
that
this
--
that
congress
gave
these
rights
out
to
a
boundary
which
was
valid
under
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
admission
because
the
united
states
at
that
time
established
a
separate
policy
for
the
gulf
of
mexico
from
what
its
policy
was,
any
place
else.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
the
--
the
boundaries
of
the
states
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and
it's
certainly
obvious
that
that's
what
they
had
done.
and
--
they
--
they
recognize
--
continue
to
recognize
the
international
boundary
--
mr.
tate
said,
the
united
states
recognizes
the
treaty,
not
unless
this,
your
honor.
the
united
states
recognizes
the
treaty
as
setting
the
boundary
between
texas
and
mexico.
but
he
goes
on
to
say
that
that
does
not
necessarily
control
--
i
think
that
the
state
--
we,
the
state
department,
have
not
had
to
pass
on
the
question
of
what
are
the
territorial
waters
of
the
treaty.
he
--
it
seems
to
me
that
he
understands
that
there
is
not
necessarily
a
connection
between
the
two,
although
for
many
purposes,
they
are
the
same.
but
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
not.
may
i
go
on
to
say,
sir,
that
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
there's
any
practical
necessity
for
following
the
state
department
policy
in
this
matter
of
boundaries
based
on
what
were
the
boundaries
100
years
ago,
because
it
will
not
--
there's
no
clear
and
present
danger
that
it
will
embarrass
the
present
conduct
of
the
foreign
policy
to
say
that
inconsistencies
occurred
in
effect.
that's
really
what
i'm
intending
to
say.
that
if
--
if
this
court
should
hold
that
there
has
been
--
there
have
been
inconsistencies
in
the
hand
--
management
of
foreign
policies
in
the
past
and
they
haven't
always,
as
the
solicitor
did
said,
feud
to
the
line.
that
determination
will
not
embarrass
present
foreign
policy
because
that's
been
presented
to
congress
and
it's
been
presented
to
this
court
and
has
--
have
been
decided
to
the
contrary.
now,
let
me
mention
hereon
to
say
simply
this,
that
the
events
after
1845
are
relevant
only
with
respect
to
whether
or
not,
the
policy
had
become
so
strong
after
1845,
that
--
that
florida's
boundary
could
not
be
approved
by
congress.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
determining
factor
there
is
here
--
this
approval
by
congress
of
the
florida
boundary
was
not
done
in
a
corner,
it
was
done
with
mr.
seward
who
may
--
gave
a
fairly
clear
statement
of
this
present
foreign
policy.
in
1862,
he
was
still
secretary
of
state,
he
was
seating
right
there
in
washington
and
again,
he
was
silent
on
this
policy
which
brings
me
simply
to
point
out
to
your
honors
that
this
--
that
the
circumstance
in
this
whole
history
that
convinces
--
that
is
--
it's
more
convincing,
it's
convincing
to
me
that
the
solicitor
general
can't
be
right
as
to
what
the
people
then
understood
about
foreign
policy,
is
the
circumstance
that
the
man
who
supposedly
formulated
this
policy
and
who
knew
it
better
than
anybody
that's
now
alive
did
not
protest
at
the
very
time
these
acts
were
going
on.
if
you
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
matter
of
fact
that
mr.
jefferson
who's
founded
it
and
mr.
adams
who
was
the
peace
commissioner,
mr.
madison,
mr.
monroe,
none
of
them
raised
any
question
about
these
three
and
six-league
boundaries
--
boundary
stated
in
that
term
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
that
john
quincy
adams
and
clay
and
gallatin
and
rush
who
were
against
and
adams
and
richard
rush
who
negotiated
the
treaty
of
1818,
john
quincy
adams
and
middleton,
who
had
negotiated
with
russia
on
this
matter
of
the
ukase
of
1821
that
francis
(inaudible)
who
was
the
man
intimately
involved
with
this
matter
in
the
falkland
islands,
that
daniel
webster
who
wrote
on
this
territoriality
of
ships.
and
john
c.
calhoun
was
all
around
in
an
active
public
life
at
the
time
that
texas
was
recognized
that
nobody
said
anything
about
it.
webster
was
in
the
senate
when
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
was
approved,
clay,
francis
(inaudible)
were
--
were
--
was
around,
john
tyler,
john
c.
calhoun
were
all
there,
knowing
better
than
anybody
else
that
this
consistent
policy
was
being
followed
by
the
government
and
not
one
of
them
raised
a
word.
why
did
mr.
seward
saying
what
he
had
said
to
spain,
why
didn't
he
say
something
--
why
did
he
draft
the
--
the
alaska
treaty
including
these
broad
water
boundaries
instead
of
--
as
we
probably
would
under
the
solicitor
general
and
the
state
department
would
today,
define
the
islands
where
they
--
a
belt
of
--
of
territorial
waters
going
around
it?
why
was
--
why
was
mr.
seward
quiet
in
washington
when
this
congressional
--
when
this
florida
boundary
was
approved?
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
chrys
dougherty
there
is
no
written
document.
there
is
no
record
in
congress,
sir.
and
that
very
fact
belies
to
me
that
this
policy
could
be
--
have
been
as
strong
as
the
solicitor
claims
it
was
at
that
period.
thank
you.
