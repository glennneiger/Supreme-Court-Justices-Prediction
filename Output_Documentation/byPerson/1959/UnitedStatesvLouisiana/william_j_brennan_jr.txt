justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
this
is
the
right
time
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it
measures
(inaudible)
the
coastline
itself
and
the
claim
is
about
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
i
--
i
found
it.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
solicitor,
are
we
on
the
page
to
which
was
cited
here
62071
in
the
texas
brief
footnote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
going
to
read
us,
i
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apparently,
volume
33
miscellaneous
page
62071.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
reading
from
that
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
these
questions
--
did
you
answer
justice
whittaker
to
three
miles
from
the
coast
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
mean
high
gulf
of
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
coast?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
only
under
section
4,
i
gather,
of
the
act.
what
the
government's
position
is
they
make
sense,
the
three
miles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
now,
this
--
this
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
trying
to
get
to
--
we
heard
from
mr.
sachse
yesterday
that
“coast”
for
the
purposes
you
just
mentioned,
the
three
miles
provision
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
some
artificial
line,
as
i
understood
follows
clearly.
are
you
in
accordance
with
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
now,
what
we
see
on
the
map
behind
us
are
measured
from
this
line
about
what
mr.
sachse
told
us
yesterday?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
is
to
say
that
what
the
line
is
the
government
tried
to
--
just
has
yet
been
defined.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
--
this
would
still,
whatever
the
outcome
is
for
date,
even
been
measuring
the
three
miles
that
the
government
position
is
there
will
have
to
be
measured
in
some
of
the
coastline
not
yet
determined
if
the
louisiana
position
with
the
coast
guard
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
water
space?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
water
around
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
three
miles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
under
each
of
the
islands?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
to
this
line
at
one
point
is
beyond
the
continental
shelf.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
we
got
this
yesterday.
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
mr.
--
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
--
may
i
just
clear
up
one
thing
that
puzzles
me?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
united
states
concedes
that
this
water
between
those
--
outermost
islands
in
the
shore.
mississippi
is
a
part
of
the
inland
waters
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
however
claim
that
you
get
it
not
by
reason
of
that
or
in
addition
to
getting
it
that
way.
you
get
it
because
it's
within
your
boundaries.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
come
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
boundary
is
at
the
outermost
island.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
what
--
that
does
in
the
beginning
point
under
which
you
are
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
senator,
before
you
go
on
to
that.
in
the
gulf
could
there
been
any
other
state
competing
for
the
boundary
claim
by
--
barred
in
the
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
there
have
been
at
that
time
because
even
--
even
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
we
were
enlarged
from
what
it
had
been
even
on
that
premise,
would
this
have
taken
anything
from
any
other
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
these
in
the
brief,
senator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
point
on
the
map
where
the
location
of
the
area
in
dispute
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
are
now
then
in
the
submitted
constitution,
this
course
from
that
strait
to
the
head
of
the
st.
mary's
river?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
reflects
the
settlement
then,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
question
senator.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
whether
at
the
time
on
the
discussion
of
the
submerged
land
act
in
1953.
this
is
what
the
discussion
and
what
approval
meant
in
relation
to
the
approval
of
the
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
year
was
that
senator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
--
that's
quite
recently.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
far
as
the
yield
--
as
the
yield
of
the
questions
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
concerned
about
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
some
instances,
they
1were
concerned
with
the
salaries
to
be
paid,
paid
opposite,
were
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
raised
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
march
2nd.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
the
act
of
march
23rd.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
the
act
of
march
2nd?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
swarth
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
your
argument
that
used
the
word
expressly
approved
the
constitution
that
save
the
state
of
florida.
we
still
would
not
debate,
am
i
correct,
that
this
was
an
approval
for
the
purposes
of
the
sla.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
it
would
or
it
would
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
not
in
other
words
nothing
short
for
the
purpose
of
the
sla
of
--
we
approved
the
boundaries
as
delineated
in
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
florida.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it
would
satisfy
the
principle?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
less
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
--
if
the
(inaudible)
had
read,
we
approved
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
florida,
was
that
not
been
approved
for?
