justice
william
o.
douglas
in
parts
of
the
united
states,
i
--
i
just
haven't
--
do
that.
i
haven't
got
down
anything
in
that
case,
that
touches
on
this
maritime
bill.
they
were
litigating
there
the
west
and
the
northern
boundaries,
i
think.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
was
the
reference
to
president
jackson?
justice
william
o.
douglas
his
message
to
congress?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
your
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
that
your
--
your
position
of
the
boundaries,
something
rather
simple
and
that
is
that
we
annexed
texas
and
texas
did
not
annex
us
if
it
was
--
turning
it
into
a
--
into
a
national
system
of
a
three-mile
wide.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean,
that's
really
your
starting
point.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
have
a
separate
brief
or
just
a
joint
brief?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
have
a
separate
brief?
justice
william
o.
douglas
white
one?
justice
william
o.
douglas
thank
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
there's
no
question
of
what
the
--
this
--
this
court
from
the
very
beginning
has
been
sitting
on
boundary
questions.
boundary
questions
of
any
states
are
--
are
reports
of
the
bill
of
boundary
decisions.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
they
--
this
case
falls
within
that
category?
justice
william
o.
douglas
united
states
versus
michigan?
justice
william
o.
douglas
190.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
did
this
case
decide?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
this
your
brief
as
to
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
congress
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
congress
was
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
document
25.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
--
i
thought
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
argument,
you
(inaudible)
attention
of
the
court
to
some
of
the
cases
involving
provisions
of
the
state
constitutions
that
were
so-called
approved
when
they
were
challenged
in
the
court.
you
mentioned
them
in
your
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
not
--
you're
not
relying
upon
them
in
your
argument
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
was
a
language
in
there
about
the
approval
or
disapproval,
but
to
those
--
while
those
line
of
cases
seem
to
help
you,
there
are
other
line
of
cases
that
--
in
the
court
that
work
against
you,
it
seems
to
me,
the
boundary
case
where
there
had
been
boundary
described
in
the
constitutions
that
were
admitted
in
the
union,
where
the
court
has
said
presumably
the
congress
in
admitting
the
state
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
approved
the
boundaries
that
were
specified
in
the
constitution.
