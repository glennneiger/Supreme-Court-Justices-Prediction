mr.
george
s.
swarth
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
attorney
general
ervin
referred
to
statement
by
the
american
law
institute
to
the
effect
that
this
act
does
not
depend
on
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea.
in
connection
with
that,
i
would
like
to
compare
what
senator
daniel
told
the
senate
committee
when
he
was
discussing
the
act.
he
said,
"there
is
no
question
but
that
the
holland
bill
simply
gives
to
the
states
the
lands
within
their
original
boundaries
within
their
territorial
waters
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union".
you'll
find
that
quoted
on
page
24
of
the
government's
reply
brief.
it
is
our
medium-sized
brief.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
i
think
this
shows
that
the
boundaries
referred
to
in
the
act
are
the
boundaries
of
territorial
waters.
i
don't
think
that
directly
gets
to
the
question
of
shrinkage
but
rather
the
kind
of
boundary
we're
talking
about.
senator
daniel
said
explicitly
with
the
territorial
water
boundary
and
i
think
the
act
having
been
represented
in
that
light
to
congress,
it's
hardly
open
to
the
states
now
to
say
that
it
mean
something
other
than
territorial
waters.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no,
i
think
not.
he
says
within
their
territorial
waters
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
i
--
i
think
of
course
senator
daniel
was
concerned
with
the
texas
aspect
of
it
and
i
think
for
that
reason,
he
was
concentrating
on
the
time
they
entered
the
union.
but
the
kind
of
boundary
that
is
involved
whether
it
is
a
territorial
water
boundary
or
whether
it
is
some
other
kind
of
a
boundary
altogether,
i
think
must
be
the
same
whether
it
existed
when
it
entered
the
union
or
was
subsequently
approved
by
the
congress.
there
was
no
indication
that
congress
was
thinking
of
a
different
kind
of
a
boundary
of
--
in
the
one
case
and
in
the
other.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
yes,
but
i
think
that
means
a
territorial
water
boundary,
not
--
not
a
special
boundary
of
some
other
sort
as
has
been
suggested
to
pay
a
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
i
mean
i
think
it
is
the
kind
of
a
boundary
that
they
were
speaking
of
--
of
--
if
it
was
three
miles
or
if
it
was
more
than
three
miles,
of
course
we
don't
think
it
could
have
been.
but
in
any
case,
we
think
they
were
speaking
of
a
boundary
of
territorial
waters.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
oh,
yes.
yes
indeed.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes,
exactly.
one
more
comment
on
this
american
law
institute
statement.
we
questioned
the
reporter
of
the
institute
about
it
and
he
replied
that
his
purpose
had
been
to
indicate
that
the
division
of
these
submerged
lands
could
be
made
without
affecting
the
question
of
international
boundary,
the
three
mile
limit,
which
of
course
it
could
be
done.
and
he
said
it
was
not
intended
to
express
an
opinion
as
to
what
congress
had
done
with
respect
--
what
congress
had
done
with
respect
to
any
particular
gulf
state
in
passing
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953,
if
the
comment
gives
any
different
impression
as
the
result
of
an
inadvertence.
it
will
be
corrected
in
the
next
draft.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
is
correct.
he
had
not
intended
to
construe
what
the
act
actually
did
but
was
speaking
rather
of
what
congress
could
do.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
is
correct.
now,
coming
to
the
particular
problems
of
florida
as
was
observed
yesterday.
florida
has
two
strings
to
its
bow;
it's
the
only
state
does.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
the
other
states,
there
was
no
other
instance
where
a
different
boundary
description
appeared
in
a
reconstruction
constitution
from
the
description
that
had
existed
when
the
state
became
the
member
of
the
union.
so
that
the
--
the
18
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
there
were
in
some
and
not
in
others.
question
was
asked
--
mr.
justice
black
asked
whether
other
constitutions
approved
or
dealt
with
by
the
act
of
june
25,
1868
contained
boundary
descriptions.
the
constitutions
of
south
carolina,
louisiana
and
georgia
did
not.
the
constitution
of
florida
did
and
i
believe
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
believe
north
carolina
and
alabama
were
also
covered
by
that
act.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
am
not
--
i
accept
your
statement
on
that.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
but
there
were
constitutions
which
did
not
contain.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
i
am
not
mr.
justice
black.
now,
florida's
--
the
first
phase
of
the
first
string
to
florida's
bow
is
that
spain
had
made
extended
claims
of
maritime
boundary.
and
to
establish
that,
they
referred
to
a
variety
of
--
of
treaties
and
arrangements
of
one
sort
and
another
which
established
quite
a
variety
of
distances
for
different
purposes
and
then
different
parts
of
the
world,
some
relating
to
spanish
coasts,
some
relating
to
foreign
coasts.
we
think
that
no
consistent
pattern
--
quite
evident,
no
consistent
pattern
appears
from
those.
you
have
distances
of
three
leagues,
two
leagues,
sight
--
sight
ten
leagues.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
these
are
all
over
the
world.
one
was
fishing
within
--
there
is
to
be
no
fish
--
no
spanish
fishing
within
three
leagues
of
british
coasts
in
the
gulf
of
st.
lawrence,
one
forbad
boats
under
100
tons
displacement
to
carry
contraband
within
two
leagues
of
spanish
ports.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
none
of
these
related
to
the
gulf
coast.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
we
find
no
spanish
pronouncement
relating
to
the
gulf
coast
in
this
respect.
there
was
silence.
however,
in
1797,
there
was
a
spanish
cedula
announced
by
the
king
which
said
this,
"the
immunity
of
the
coasts
of
all
my
dominions,
all
my
dominions,
will
not
be
measured
as
was
done
until
now
by
the
doubtful
and
uncertain
range
of
canon
but
by
the
distance
of
two
miles
of
950
places
each.”
those
are
almost
exactly
geographic
miles.
now,
that
remained
in
effect
from
1797
when
it
was
announced
until
many
years
after
florida
was
seated
to
the
united
states
in
1819.
we
think
that
if
spain
ever
did
have
any
different
policy,
that
policy
was
superseded
in
1897
by
this
very
definite
pronouncement
and
which
remained
in
effect
until
1819.
now,
as
to
the
british
claims,
that
of
course
rests
on
king
george's
proclamation
describing
florida's
as
bounded
by
--
i
have
to
say,
by
the
atlantic
ocean
of
the
gulf
of
florida
including
all
islands
within
the
six
leagues
to
the
coast.
well,
the
solicitor
general
has
already
explained
our
views
about
the
effect
to
be
given
to
a
statement
including
all
islands
within
a
certain
distance.
we
think
it
means
what
it
says,
islands.
the
suggestion
was
made
yesterday
that
effect
must
be
given
to
every
part
of
a
description
and
that
we're
trying
to
read
something
out
of
it.
and
we
think
on
the
contrary,
the
states
are
trying
to
read
something
out
of
it.
if
it
had
simply
said
extending
into
the
gulf
six
leagues,
then
certainly,
they
would
be
in
the
right
as
to
what
meaning
of
that
phrase
was.
but
when
it
says
--
the
addition
of
the
word
“islands”
does
not
necessarily
add
to
the
scope
of
the
description
i
think
it
restricts
it
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues.
we
have
the
principle
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius
est,
and
we
think
by
mentioning
islands,
they
excluded
other,
the
water
in
the
submerged
land.
now,
the
case
of
mahler
against
norwich
&
new
york
transportation
company
was
mentioned.
that
case
is
discussed
in
the
government
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
first
aspect
of
their
argument
and
i
will
come
to
this
other
in
just
a
minute.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
this
mahler
case
is
discussed
at
pages
83
to
85
of
our
reply
brief
or
medium-sized
brief.
and
i
think
it
is
enough
to
distinguish
that
case
simply
to
point
out
the
description
that
was
involved
there.
it
began
a
line
--
it
was
the
perimeter
of
new
york
that
is
being
described,
the
state
of
new
york.
it
began
in
long
island
sound
at
the
connecticut
boundary,
went
up
the
river
and
around
new
york
counter
clockwise
and
came
to
sandy
hook,
which
of
course
is
the
southern
headland
of
new
york
bay.
and
it
said
from
sandy
hook
to
the
place
of
beginning
which
was
the
connecticut
boundary
in
long
island,
in
long
island
sound.
"to
the
place
of
beginning
in
such
manner
as
to
include
long
island,
staten
island,”
-
there's
a
long
enumerated
list
of
islands
-
“and
all
the
islands
and
waters
in
the
bay
of
new
york
and
within
the
bounds
above
described.”
we
think
that
description
is
so
different
from
the
ones
we
have
here.
it
says
to
draw
the
line
in
such
manner
as
to
include
the
islands.
we
think
the
court
construed
it
in
the
only
way
it
could
possibly
be
construed.
it
did
just
that,
it
drew
the
line
around
the
islands
and
taking
in
the
water
which
fell
within
a
line
so
drawn
because
it
says,
"and
all
the
islands
and
waters
within
the
bounds
above
described.”
well,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
description
that
king
george
used
in
his
proclamation
or
that
the
--
appears
on
the
descriptions
of
these
other
gulf
states
and
we
think
that
entirely
distinguishes
that.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
am
sorry.
i
can't
tell
you,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
think
even
if
great
britain
and
spain
had
claimed
more
than
three
miles,
it
was
of
course
the
position
of
--
of
the
united
states
that
international
law
does
not
permit
such
claims,
that
this
government
refused
to
recognize
such
claims.
and
we
think
that
the
court
should
accept
that
view
of
the
international
law
and
should
not
recognize
a
foreign
government
as
having
possessed
what
this
government
refused
to
recognize
it
as
possessing.
in
any
event,
florida
does
not
derive
its
title
from
spain
or
from
great
britain.
florida
derives
its
title
from
the
united
states.
it
was
their
possession
and
their
territory
for
many
years
before
it
became
a
state.
and
certainly,
when
the
united
states
acquired
florida
from
spain,
the
maritime
boundary
policy
of
the
united
states
became
applicable
to
it.
and
whether
the
prior
sovereigns
that
claimed
more
or
less,
we
think
it
is
quite
plain
that
at
that
point,
the
united
states
imposed
its
three-league
policy
on
the
territory
of
florida.
actually,
what
we
think
--
a
three-mile
policy,
excuse
me,
on
the
territory
of
florida.
actually,
we
think
what
happened
was
that
the
spanish
boundary
of
two
miles
was
expanded
to
three
miles
when
we
acquired
florida.
and
florida
of
course
as
a
territory
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
exactly.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
is
our
view
for
precisely,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
now,
florida
of
course
as
a
territory,
could
not
have
any
independent
policy.
and
united
states
established
all
its
policies
for
it
and
there
was
certainly
no
question
of
independent
policy
there
so
that
as
to
florida,
as
in
the
case
of
louisiana,
mississippi
and
alabama.
the
question
of
whether
at
the
time
it
became
a
state
means
just
before
or
means
upon
statehood
is
quite
immaterial
because
for
many
years
before
statehood,
it
was
subject
--
plainly
subject
to
the
national
policy
of
the
united
states.
this
case
of
pope
against
blanton
which
senator
holland
mentioned,
the
case
is
of
little
significance
because
this
court
directed
it
to
be
dismissed
for
the
lack
of
juris
--
for
lack
of
a
jurisdictional
amount.
however,
in
that
case,
the
district
court
did
say
that
the
treaty
with
spain
fixed
the
boundaries
--
that
is
the
1819
treaty
by
which
we
acquired
florida.
fixed
the
boundaries
of
florida
as
the
east
and
west
florida's
together
with
adjacent
islands,
the
act
of
congress
adopted
that.
this
act
in
effect
described
one
of
the
boundaries
as
being
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
is
by
its
adoption
of
the
spanish
description.
under
international
law,
this
means
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
extends
one
league
into
the
gulf
or
three
miles.
that
was
the
view
that
the
lower
court
took
in
pope
against
blanton
as
far
as
the
claim
of
--
based
on
the
spanish
claims
was
concerned.
as
i
say,
however,
the
case
was
dismissed
later
for
lack
of
jurisdictional
amount.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
florida's
boundary
as
claimed
in
its
constitution
of
1868,
has
been
approved
by
congress.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
oh,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes,
it
did.
it
consisted
of
mainland
and
islands
and
by
virtue
of
general
international
laws
applied
by
the
united
states,
a
three-mile
belt
around
the
mainland
and
the
three-mile
belt
around
the
islands.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
it
attempted
to
do
so
certainly.
we
don't
think
it
succeeded.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
so
far
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
so
far
as
i
know,
this
was
an
innovation
by
the
constitution
writers
of
florida.
perhaps
they
were
looking
at
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
or
the
president
of
the
republic
of
texas,
i
don't
know.
it's
an
--
we
don't
have
any
record
of
what
they
were
looking
at.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes,
they
were
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
they
were
practically
simultaneous.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
i
believe
one
them
related
only
to
islands
within
the
stated
distance.
at
that
time,
florida
was
--
but
i
was
taking
that
episode
as
a
whole.
i
think
as
far
as
i
know,
there
was
no
background
for
it,
it
--
it
is
apparent
historically.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
believe
there
was,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes
it
does,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
not
by
virtue
of
any
terms
of
the
description
but
by
virtue
of
a
general
principle
of
international
law
as
applied
by
the
united
states.
but
that
is
an
incident
which
follows
automatically
on
american
possession
of
land
bordering
on
the
sea.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes,
i
think
it
did.
i
think
it
attempted
to
go
beyond
what
international
law
gives
and
to
take
something
more
out
of
the
ocean
which
belongs
to
all
nations.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
i
will
attempt
to
(inaudible)
through
and
apply
the
florida
description.
if
it
means
three
leagues
from
the
mainland,
it
would
of
course
be
conceivable
if
there
would
be
so
many
islands
with
three-mile
marginal
belt,
if
there'd
be
no
difference
but
that
is
not
the
fact
however.
there
are
in
fact
parts
of
the
florida
coast,
the
gulf
coast
where
there
are
no
--
not
a
substantial
number
of
islands
at
a
distance
of
three
leagues
or
approaching
it.
there
are
areas
where
the
change
in
description
would
have
made
a
very
great
difference,
that
very
substantial
areas,
i
think
along
most
of
the
coast,
it
would
make
a
substantial
difference
in
fact.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
that
is
precisely
what
i
wanted
to
discuss
in
the
remainder
of
my
argument
of
--
we
think
that
the
reconstruction
act
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no,
we
do
not,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
we
agree
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
don't
think
that
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
is
an
issue
now
or
could
be.
the
question
is
whether
congress
did
approve
or
whether
it
required
something
of
the
states
that
it
couldn't
have
required
or
shouldn't
have
required,
it
seems
to
me
not
relevant
to
the
question
of
what
congress
did.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
in
1868.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
is
true.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
because
the
chain
of
events
stopped
right
there,
congress
didn't
approved.
congress
simply
said
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that's
our
position,
mr.
justice
black.
what
congress
said
is,
"these
constitutions
are
republican
and
senators
and
representatives
may
return
to
congress,"
and
that
is
all
that
congress
said.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
it
did
not,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes,
they
were.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
by
a
specific
declaration
being
enacted,
that's
not
senators
and
representative,
maybe
received
in
congress.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes
they
were.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
not
quite.
the
statement
in
the
first
act
was
that
if
they
submit
new
constitutions
and
if
they
are
approved
by
congress,
then
the
congress
will
admit
senators
and
representatives.
it
did
not
actually
say
that
that
was
the
only
condition
on
which
congress
would
approve
them
and
this
is
more
than
a
quibble.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
it's
said
if
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
--
it
said
if
that
was
done,
congress
would
admit
that
they're
senators
and
representatives.
it
did
not
say
congress
would
not
admit
them
otherwise.
and
that
is
a
little
more
than
a
quibble
because
that
act
of
march
2,
1867
had
set
down
a
requirement
as
to
the
number
of
voters
who
must
approve
state
constitutions.
they
require
that
a
majority
of
the
registered
voters
vote
in
an
election
which
approved
them.
and
that
was
one
of
the
conditions
laid
down
in
the
act
of
18
--
of
march
2,
1867
along
with
this
requirement
of
approval
by
congress
and
so
on.
and
yet
in
the
case
of
alabama,
a
majority
of
the
voters
did
not
vote
in
the
election
so,
the
according
to
the
terms
of
1867
act,
the
constitution
was
not
properly
adopted.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
but
that
was
not
that
the
act
of
1967
had
required.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
precisely.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that's
precisely
my
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
we
think
that
if
congress
ever
did
intend
to
impose
approval,
a
blanket
approval
of
the
constitution
as
a
condition
of
admission
that
--
we
don't
think
it
did
and
i
want
to
come
on
that
in
a
minute.
but
if
it
did,
we
think
that
was
abandoned
by
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
if
i
may
then
i
would
like
to
get
into
the
history
of
the
act
of
march
2,
1867,
which
first
laid
down
that
requirement
and
which
i
think
shows
that
it
did
not
mean
a
complete
comprehensive
approval
in
every
aspect
of
the
constitution.
we
think
that
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
think
my
first
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
is
that
the
--
the
statute
that
we
are
concerned
with
is
the
statute
of
1868
and
it
says
no
word
of
approval
at
all.
the
state
of
florida
is
trying
to
read
into
that
statute
an
approval
that
was
mentioned
in
the
act
of
1867.
in
other
words,
they
are
trying
to
go
behind
the
language
of
the
act
of
1868
to
find
something
which
on
its
face
it
does
not
at
all
express.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
is
15
statutes
at
large,
page
73.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
at
page
331
in
the
government's
large
brief.
now,
that
act
said
--
well,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
--
well,
i
think
the
language
of
that
act
plainly
on
its
face
does
not
include
approval
whereas
the
people
of
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
and
so
on
have
framed
constitutions
of
state
government
which
are
republican.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'll
be
glad
to
read
the
whole
thing.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
in
pursuance
of
provisions
of
an
act
entitled
an
act
for
the
more
efficient
government
of
the
rebel
states.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
as
to
what
the
states
did.
the
states
in
pursuance
of
that
act
have
adopted
constitutions,
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
quite
agree.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
quite
agree.
but
if
in
construing
the
act
of
1868,
if
we
are
going
to
look
back
to
the
act
1867
to
find
what
the
act
of
1868
meant,
i
think
also,
we're
entitled
to
look
at
to
the
debates
to
see
what
the
act
of
1867
was.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
the
act
of
1868.
congressman
stevens
who
was
chairman
of
the
committee
in
the
house
said,
"we
have
looked
at
these
constitutions,
we
have
pronounced
them
republican
in
form
and
all
we
propose
to
require
is
that
they
shall
remain
so
forever,
subject
to
this
requirement,
we
are
willing
to
admit
them
into
the
union.
all
we
propose
to
require
is
that
they
remain
republican
in
form.”
now,
i
think
that
is
very
significant
language
and
it
comes
from
the
chairman
of
the
committee
as
showing
what
congress
was
thinking
about.
this
goes
back
to
--
prior
to
the
act
of
1867.
the
states
--
the
ten
states
remaining,
tennessee
came
in
early
but
the
others
had
submitted
constitutions
which
were
somewhat
modified
by
--
in
one
way
or
another.
they
hoped
that
that
would
meet
with
the
approval
of
congress.
and
those
constitutions
were
submitted
to
congress
and
they
were
rejected,
the
joint
committee
on
reconstruction
presented
their
report
which
said,
"these
constitutions
are
unacceptable
for
three
reasons.
they
were
not
properly
adopted,
they
are
not
republican
--
the
governments
are
not
republican
in
form,
and
the
governments
are
not
loyal
to
the
union.”
and
they
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
was
with
reference
to
these
prior
constitutions.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes,
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
think
the
question
of
due
adoption
is
a
matter
of
definition
of
the
constitution.
it
isn't
the
constitution
if
it
isn't
duly
adopted.
it
--
the
--
the
others
were
documents
that
were
brought
to
congress
that
a
group
of
people
had
drafted.
and
to
call
them
constitutions
that
they
were
constitutions
in
form.
i
don't
think
that
they
could
be
properly
be
called
constitutions.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
is
true.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
and
as
the
result
then,
an
act
of
the
act
of
march
2,
1867
which
laid
down
the
procedures
to
be
followed.
how
the
conventions
were
to
be
elected,
how
they
were
to
be
held,
how
the
constitutions
were
to
be
ratified.
now,
all
that
was
implicit
in
the
statement
pursuant
to
the
act
of
1867.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes,
it
did.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
--
when
not
to
the
question
of
whether
the
form
of
the
government
adopted
by
the
constitution
was
republican
but
whether
the
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
i
think
that
is
true
that
representative
stevens
was
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
--
overstating
it
to
that
extent.
they
were
concerned
with
whether
they
were
duly
adopted,
i
think
that
was
a
necessary
concern.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
wasn't
the
problem
that
was
bothering
congress
at
this
time.
this
was
not
an
admission
of
new
states.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
these
were
existing
states
and
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
debates,
it
was
said,
congressman
bingham
said,
“every
gentleman
knows
that
you
must,
under
this
bill,
recognize
the
boundaries
of
these
states
as
originally
fixed
by
the
sovereignty
of
this
union
and
if
they
stand
as
they
were
to
this
day.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
is
quite
true
but
i
think
congress
felt
that
this
was
no
time
to
be
getting
into
any
questions
other
than
the
very
crucial
questions
of
reconstruction.
the
union
here
was
in
a
--
an
extremely
difficult
situation.
here
were
ten
states
without
adequate
government
of
their
own,
without
representation
in
congress,
it
was
a
thoroughly
unsatisfactory
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
yes,
it
was.
indeed.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
it
did.
but
congress
was
anxious
to
terminate
it
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
terminate
the
situation
to
get
the
southern
states
back
to
representation
in
congress.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
think
the
debates
reflect
that
congress
as
a
whole
was
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
they
were
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
certainly
debate
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
--
to
your
knowledge
of
that
subject.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
it
certainly
is
true,
they
were
required
to
submit
new
constitutions
before
their
senators
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
but
i
believe
that
a
reading
of
the
whole
debates
will
show
that
that
word
approval
was
used
by
everybody
as
meaning
approval
with
respect
to
this
question,
“do
they
establish
loyal
republican
governments?”
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
think
the
debate
show
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
they
were
indifferent
to
everything
else
when
other
questions
were
raised
time
after
time,
it
was
said
that
does
not
concern
us,
thus
that
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
that
point
was
raised.
congress
did
not
seem
much
impressed
by
it
but
the
man
who
raised
it
regarded
that
as
going
to
the
question
of
whether
the
government
is
republican.
he
felt
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
cannot
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
it's
true
a
great
many
people
took
the
position
of
the
states
were
out
of
the
union
and
had
to
be
readmitted.
but
i
do
not
understand
that
that
was
the
view
that
prevailed,
and
certainly
it's
not
the
view
that
this
court
has
taken.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
don't
understand
that
he
thought
the
states
had
been
out
of
the
union.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
may
be
in
error
on
that.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
oh,
well,
now
that's
a
different
question.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
certainly
as
this
court
held,
some
of
their
rights
had
fallen
into
or
some
of
their
organization
had
fallen
into
advance
but
the
court
said
that
they
were
states
within
the
union
and
that
is
i
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
oh,
no.
no,
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
claim
that
at
all.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
that
it
did
not
pertain,
that
congress
was
not
concerned
with
looking
at
or
passing
on
in
any
way
any
question
except
whether
the
constitutions
were
republican
and
the
governments
were
loyal.
on
this
question
of
salaries
which
was
raised
by
a
mr.
payne
of
wisconsin,
mr.
justice
black.
it
was
thought
to
relate
to
republicanism
in
this.
the
governor
had
excessive,
that
what
were
considered
by
him,
excessive
appointive
powers
of
officers
to
salaries
he
felt
were
excessive
so
that
the
--
his
feeling
was
the
government
was
establishing
an
oligarchy
under
the
control
of
the
governor
of
bleeding
the
state
with
this
excessive
salaries
for
a
few
chosen
people
which
he
felt
was
not
a
republican
situation.
however,
congress
brushed
that
aside.
this
is
not
--
really
being
of
concern
to
them.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
believe
that
is
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
page
292
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
on
page
285.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
section
5
is
the
relevant
section
and
it
was
introduced
by
a
senate
amendment.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
it
was
in
the
act
that
was
originally
drafted.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes,
i
--
can
tell
you
in
a
moment,
mr.
justice
black.
it
was
offered
by
senator
johnson
of
maryland
and
was
amended
by
senator
sherman
of
ohio.
there
was
never
any
discussion
of
anything
in
any
constitution
that
was
not
thought
by
the
person
doing
the
discussing
to
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
was
republican
or
the
government
loyal
or
the
constitution
duly
adopted.
they
never
ranged
beyond
what
they
conceived
to
be
within
that
scope
and
whenever
other
subjects
were
mentioned,
they
were
immediately
brushed
to
side.
we
are
not
concerned
with
that.
that
doesn't
go
to
whether
it's
republican
and
that
--
that
ended
it.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no,
mr.
justice
harlan
i
think
it
would
not.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
i
think
that
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
i
think
that
makes
it
much
clearer.
i
think
the
legislative
history
leaves
no
doubt
at
all.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
first
the
act
on
which
the
must
rely
is
the
act
of
1868
which
does
not
say
anything
about
approval.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
don't
think
that
it
quite
incorporates.
it
says
the
constitutions
have
been
submitted
pursuant
to.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
explains
where
they
came
from.
they
don't
go
on
and
say,
“we
are
going
to
do
here
what
we
said
there
we
are
going
to
do.”
the
florida
constitution
was
discussed
i
think
more
than
any
other.
it
contains
186
sections.
the
discussion,
the
subjects
discussed
appear
at
the
most
in
22
of
those
sections.
now,
that
seems
to
me
on
its
face
to
show
something
far
short
of
a
complete
discussion
of
the
constitution.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
you
misunderstood
me
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
don't
mean
that
there
were
too
many
sections
for
them
to
examine.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
my
point
is
that
their
discussion
in
fact
covered
only
22
sections
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
--
out
of
186;
i
think
that
cannot
be
considered
an
exhausted
examination
of
the
constitution.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
they
never
even
said
that?
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
now
we
had
an
answer
to
that.
when
the
constitution
of
our
console
was
being
discussed.
representative
(inaudible)
of
missouri
who
was
the
member
of
the
committee
said,
i
do
not
intend
to
discuss
both
the
feature
of
the
bill
and
question
about,
but
only
to
answer
the
objection
to
the
constitution
based
on
the
fact
the
gentlemen
have
not
seen
it
and
do
not
know
its
provisions.
i
ask
to
have
read
the
bill
of
rights,
the
article
on
subject
on
franchise
and
the
article
on
the
subject
of
education.
these
embrace
the
main
features
of
the
constitution
and
are
the
provisions
which
have
been
specially
attached
by
those
who
spoken
against
the
bill.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
perhaps
it's
true.
i
accept
the
statement
[laughter],
but
i
think
this
shows
that
congress
was
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
thank
you
mr.
justice
black.
this
shows
that
congress
was
willing
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
their
reading
for
the
benefit
of
people
who
had
not
seen
the
constitution
at
all,
a
reading
of
these
sections
which
relate
to
franchise,
education
and
the
bill
of
rights.
that
was
all
they
were
interested
in
here
and
we
think
that
--
that
shows
their
attitude
throughout
this
whole
reconstruction
episode.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes
we
would
think
so.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
we
think
it
would
not.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
that
certainly
would
satisfy.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
think
if
they
made
it
clear
that
they
were
approving
for
all
purposes
everything
in
the
constitution
that
that
would
satisfy.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
think,
in
construing
that
you
would
have
to
see
what
they
meant
by
approval.
approval
ordinarily
is
relevant
to
some
particular
criteria,
for
example,
an
appropriator
approves
a
proof
for
a
magazine,
he
doesn't
endorse
the
editorial
policy.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
you
may
approve
for
different
purposes,
the
banker
may
approve
it
to
see
if
financial
provisions
are
protected.
someone
else
may
approve
it
to
see
if
something
else
is
protected.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
that's
the
question.
i
think
you
would
have
to
have
something
to
show
whether
congress
did
intend
as
to
be
an
unlimited
approval
and
we
think
that
the
whole
history
of
the
reconstruction
debate
shows
that
they
did
not.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
i
agree
that
approval
can
be
implied
but
take
the
cases
of
implied
approval
that
they
site.
two
of
those
were
cases
where
virginia
has
entered
into
context
with
the
citizens
of
certain
counties
that
new
states
that
could
be
created.
congress
never
expressly
approved
of
those
context
but
did
admit
the
new
states.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
i
think
we
did
not.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
approval
with
respect
to
the
criteria
they
were
letting
down
in
that
act.
approval
of
the
provisions
going
to
make
a
republican
government,
and
i
think
that
what
we
accorded
from
the
debate
show
that
that's
what
they
had
in
mind.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
precise
question
of
was
the
question
which
led
to
the
introduction
of
this
provision
in
the
act,
but
it
was
a
subject
of
much
debate
as
to
whether
or
not
it
did
constitute
an
approval.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
oh
yes.
well,
i
think
it's
simply
a
question
of
whether
congress
had
actually
purposefully
approved
this
boundary
either
in
expressed
terms
or
by
implication
of
--
i
was
about
to
say,
the
cases
of
implied
approval
that
i
speak
of
or
the
cases,
for
example,
for
the
constitutional
necessity
would
be
implied.
this
virginia
context
for
new
states
to
be
created
was
not
approved
by
congress.
the
congress
did
admit
the
new
states
and
this
court
said,
congress
could
not
create
new
states,
under
the
constitution
could
not
create
new
states
out
of
an
existing
state
except
pursuant
to
its
agreement.
therefore,
we
necessarily
conclude
the
thing
that
was
done
couldn't
have
been
done
if
congress
had
not
approve
the
context.
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
here.
certainly,
representative
can
be
admitted
to
congress
while
there
are
boundary
disputes
active
boundary
disputes
are
in
effect.
texas,
for
example,
the
greer
country
dispute
was
actually
both
before
and
after
the
civil
war
and
yet
representative
of
texas
were
saved
in
congress
throughout
that
time.
it
doesn't
indicate
any
agreement
with
the
state's
boundary
claims.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
think
that
perhaps
is
correct
of
--
congress
was
well
aware
that
there
was
a
question,
a
very
definite
question,
whether
what
happened
in
1868
was
or
wasn't
an
approval
of
the
boundary.
senator
holland,
of
course,
urged
to
the
senate
that
the
boundary
had
been
approved
and
explained
why
he
thought
so.
senator
anderson
indicated
very
strongly
his
view
that
that
was
not
an
approval
at
all
of
the
boundary,
that
it
was
nothing
beyond
the
admission
of
senators
and
representatives.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
it
was
left
to
this
court.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
precisely
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i'd
put
it
a
little
more
sharply
than
that,
an
approval
for
such
purpose
as
to
approve
the
boundary,
an
approval
of
such
scope.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
oh!
i
think
one
can
approve
in
a
certain
aspect
for
a
specific
purpose,
in
fact
i
think
approval
is
more
generally
limited
to
certain
aspects
or
certain
purposes.
this
question
is
not
entirely
a
new
one
for
this
court.
in
the
case
gunn
against
barry,
15
wallace,
the
question
of
the
effect
of
this
act
of
1868
was
before
the
court,
and
it
was
said
there
regarding
the
georgia
constitution,
“though
her
constitution
was
sanctioned
by
congress,
this
provision
can
in
no
sense,
be
considered
an
act
of
that
body.”
that's
the
provision
of
charge
of
constitution.
“the
sanction
was
only
permissive
as
a
part
of
the
process
of
her
rehabilitation
and
involved
nothing
affirmative
or
negative
beyond
that
event.”
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
i
think
this
shows
that
what
congress
did
in
1868
was
not
an
approval.
it
was
merely
a
permission
for
senator
and
representative
to
return
and
nothing
affirmative
or
negative
beyond
that
event.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
think
it
meant
simply
that
senators
and
representatives
could
return
to
congress.
that's
all
it
said.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
because
congress
had
found
the
constitution
to
be
republican.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well
then
of
course
we
get
back
to
the
question
on
what
they
meant
in
1867
when
they
said
approval.
we
think
they
meant
in
effect
determine
that
it
was
republican.
i
think
there
is
something
in
the
act
of
1868
that
shows
a
rather
studied
the
avoidance
of
saying
it
was
approved.
in
that
act
where
they
refer
to
the
constitution
requirements,
they
say
the
constitutions
herein
recognize,
rather
than,
i
think
it
would
be
the
natural
language
hereby
approved
if
they
had
intended
an
approval.
there
is
another
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
don't
point
the
case
for
its
holding
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
i
think
the
confirmation
as
to
the
effect
that
it
met
the
requirements
of
the
reconstruction
act
of
1867.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
it
said
the
constitution
which
is
republican
and
in
conformity
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
throughout
the
debates
they
consciously
said
that
is
all
the
concern
here,
is
it
republican
or
is
it
in
conformity
with
the
constitution.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
gunn
against
barry
was
such
a
case
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
yes
indeed,
we
may
not
abandoning
anything
find
in
the
brief.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that's
in
admitting
a
new
state,
yes.
i
don't
think
that
that
--
the
problems
here
were
not
the
problems
of
admitting
a
new
state,
they
were
simply
the
problem
of
getting
the
senators
and
congressman
back.
the
state
was
already
here,
they
are
not
concern
of
--
of
any
other
questions
and
whether
they
had
to
again
establish
an
adequate
government.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
no.
i
am
afraid
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
i
don't
feel
that
that
shows
that
congress
was
concerned
with
any
other
questions
beyond
that.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
was
simply
--
mr.
george
s.
swarth
that
wasn't
--
disagreements
between
them
and
him
as
to
whether
the
constitution
submitted
were
loyal
and
republican.
mr.
george
s.
swarth
well,
i
think
the
question
here
is
what
congress
actually
did
of
what
it
could
have
done
or
invoke
the
(inaudible)
mr.
george
s.
swarth
yes
sir.
