m.
harlan
are
any
of
the
states
in
claiming
the
rights
of
continental
shelf
to
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
for
my
question
was
--
my
recollection
to
the
original
argument
in
this
case
where
louisiana
was
the
sole
party
was
that
were
was
a
claim
made
to
be
extended
beyond
three
leagues
up
to
the
continental
shelf,
that
claim
has
been
abandoned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
measure
of
its
claim
now
is
three
leagues
and
no
more,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
basic
issue
here
is
really
isn't
that
what
would
matter
by
a
congress
limited
the
--
extended
the
grant
subject
to
three
leagues
by
the
word
boundaries.
you
say
it's
territorial
boundary
and
--
or
at
least
in
--
in
a
single
sense
boundary
means,
something
like
a
territorial
boundary
would.
the
states
say
that
boundary
is
a
fluctuating
term
that
has
something
beyond
the
concept
of
an
ordinary
territorial
boundary
and
the
problem
is
to
find
out
what
congress
meant
by
boundary,
isn't
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
we
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
intended
it
to
be
inherent
for
the
questioning.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
your
saying
is
where
the
boundary
is
inappropriate
to
describe
anything
short
of
a
maritime
boundary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
yet
in
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
where
the
united
states
was
claiming
rights
whether
however
you
might
characterize
them,
of
up
to
three
leagues,
something
short
of
this
maritime
boundary
as
you
--
as
you
would
say,
are
they
used
as
a
descriptive
of
those
rights
whatever
they
were
at
the
term,
boundary,
didn't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
that
very
circumstance
indicates
the
boundary
does
not
necessarily
have
the
inflexible
content,
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
your
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
exactly
what
i'm
suggesting.and
not
to
look
at
the
context
in
which
the
word,
boundary,
is
used
before
you
can
describe
what
the
legal
effect,
what
the
--
what
--
what
a
legal
boundary
means.
justice
john
m.
harlan
dating
back
to
a
time
wherein
--
and
i
--
i'm
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
boundary
line
is
not
defined
in
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
--
supposing
congress
had
said
in
the
statute,
“boundary
line
as
herein
used,
means
historical
boundary
which
would
have
given
a
state
the
right
at
the
time
it
came
into
the
union
to
exploit
submerged
lands
what
would
your
position
have
been
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
supposing
congress
had
said
that,
would
you
be
in
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
they'll
define
boundary
--
they
define
boundary
in
the
hypothetical
that
i'm
putting
in
and
not
in
terms
of
the
maritime
boundary
is
your
arguing
for,
but
use
the
word
boundary
as
it's
used
here
and
then
in
another
section
say,
boundary
means
the
kind
of
a
boundary
that
would
have
given
a
state
at
the
time
he
entered
the
union
the
right
to
exploit
submerged
lands.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
think
this
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
question
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
congress
did
something
to
those
cases
when
it
at
least
extended
the
state's
right
to
exploit
(inaudible)
the
decisions
of
the
three
miles.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
it
overruled
those
cases
at
least
to
that
extent,
did
he
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
put
it
that
way.
yes.
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
what
does
it
mean
--
what
are
the
circumstances
that
show
the
kind
of
the
present
complaint
of
territorial
rights
(inaudible)
united
states
thought
that
it
was
granting
some
kind
of
a
new
principle
of
international
law
to
the
search
in
the
right
claim?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
would
it
be
a
fair
assumption
that
if
that
claim
had
been
asserted
in
1848,
that
the
united
states
could
have
done
so,
consistently
with
its
three-mile
maritime
boundary
policy?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know
it's
speculative.
that's
a
reason
i
asked
you
the
first
question.
in
other
words,
you
say
that
at
the
time
the
assertion
was
made
in
1945,
for
the
first
time,
the
united
states
rightly
or
wrongly
assumed
that
it
was
not
doing
anything,
but
what
international
law
--
it
could
have
done
under
international
so-called,
at
any
time
during
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
at
least
as
of
1945,
do
you
think
it's
a
fair
statement
that
the
united
states
in
issuing
that
proclamation
when
the
extraterritorial
rights
did
not
conceive
it
was
announcing
--
asserting
some
new
principle
of
international
rights.
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
i'm
anticipating,
mr.
hart,
by
when
i'm
going
to
ask
you
what
you're
going
to
argue.
is
it
your
position
that
the
legal
effect
of
the
act
of
admission
to
the
union
is
an
immaterial
circumstance
in
determining
what
the
state's
boundary
was
at
the
time
of
admission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
--
if
i
understand
that,
that
does
not
exclude
or
as
you're
not
in
--
in
real
difference
with
the
government
here
up
to
this
point,
are
you?because
if
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
it
is
the
law
you
--
you'll
--
you'll
say
among
other
things
that
you
have
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
act
of
admission.
that's
one
of
the
circumstances,
it's
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
inclusive
one,
but
one
of
them.
that's
a
proper
consideration
--
legal
consideration
to
take
into
account.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
it
is
open
whether
the
government
is
right
or
wrong,
it
is
open
as
one
factor
for
the
consideration
of
the
court
to
take
into
account
the
legal
effect
--
the
legal
effect
for
the
act
of
admission.
they
maybe
wrong
as
to
what
the
legal
effect
is.
but
you
agree
as
i
understand
it
that
the
legal
effect
is
a
--
an
appropriate
consideration
to
take
into
account
in
determining
what
the
historic
boundary
was.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
appreciate
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
appreciate
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
appreciate
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
disagreement
is
--
is
to
the
government's
legal
proposition
rather
than
--
rather
than
as
to
the
relevance
of
it
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
regard
the
time
prior
to
or
immediately
prior
to
what
you're
talking
about,
i
gather,
is
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
the
test
of
boundary
is
the
boundary
whatever
it
was
with
respect
to
which
and
with
whatever
legal
consequences
it
had,
the
act
of
admission
was
brought
to
bear.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
put
this
question
to
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
hypothetical.
the
act
of
1836
claimed
for
texas
have
provided
for
texas,
a
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf.
supposing
that
the
act
of
admission
had
said
that
the
boundary
of
texas
was
admitted
with
the
international
maritime
boundary
of
three
miles.
what
would
be
the
measure
of
the
--
of
the
rights
under
the
submerged
lands
act
or
not
say
that
that's
under
--
under
this
--
under
this
act,
texas'
rights?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
appreciate
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but,
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
notwithstanding
the
expressed
cutting
down
of
those
boundaries
by
the
act
of
admission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
realized
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
putting
that
to
you
to
test
out
what
my
--
i'm
trying
to
get
my
understanding
as
to
whether
there
is
a
difference
between
the
government's
view
of
the
test
and
your
view
of
the
test
and
your
answer
to
that
question
indicates,
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
sort
of
(inaudible)
regard
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
does
tend
to
show
however
that
congress
was
conscious
of
the
possible
bearing
of
international
law
on
this
problem,
does
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
upon
this
problem,
upon
what
they
were
doing.
it
does
show
that
much.
justice
john
m.
harlan
exactly
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
mr.
hart,
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
government's
view
that
boundaries
necessarily
means
the
state's
maritime
boundaries?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
elaborate
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
argument
that
you're
making,
are
you
accepting
the
view
of
the
government
that
the
kind
of
a
texas
boundary
that
you
have
to
show
historically
was
one
that
recognizes
the
territorial
waters
in
texas
that
extended
the
three-league?
justice
john
m.
harlan
territorial
water
boundary?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
what
the
government
claims
it
didn't
and
that's
what
the
government
claims
that
it's
essential
for
you
to
show
in
order
to
bring
yourselves
within
the
sla.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
you
are
arguing
at
the
moment
is
that
you
can
show
that
the
united
states,
despite
its
general
policy
as
to
three-mile
and
it's
recognized
a
territorial
boundary,
territorial
water
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
of
three
leagues.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
was
a
former
president.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
submerged
lands
act
itself
recognizes
the
validity
of
the
historic
texas
claim,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
considering
the
legislative
history
(inaudible)
that
the
effect
of
the
act
was
simply
to
show
the
matter
into
the
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
know
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
governor,
just
so
that
i
understand,
the
essence
of
your
argument
is
that
this
act
properly
construed
by
the
legislative
record
--
legislative
history,
itself,
in
and
of
itself,
gave
these
rights
of
three
leagues
in
the
state
of
texas.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
the
time
of
the
admission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
your
view
is,
i
take
it,
all
we
have
(inaudible)
is
whether
some
--
all
these
states
get
three
leagues
or
three
miles?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
--
then,
once
that's
decided,
then
you
say
it
becomes
a
surveyor's
job
in
effect
to
determine
what
the
baseline
is
and
what
you
measure
either
one
of
those
distance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
--
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
including
the
national
boundary?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
point
we're
right
back
were
a
discussion
would
serve
to
your
favor
as
--
as
to
what
should
be.
justice
john
m.
harlan
pardon
me.
namely,
what
are
the
criteria
of
this
statute,
the
legal
criteria
under
the
statute
(inaudible)
the
meaning
in
the
word
“boundary”,
historic
boundary,
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
we
get
it,
you
argue
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
consequence
of
your
argument
purports
to
(inaudible)
that
the
boundary
of
texas
if
it
was
established
according
to
your
criteria
(inaudible)
the
international
boundary
of
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
point
is
wether
you
want
to
(inaudible)
what
the
area
was
that
is
being
claimed
by
the
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
put
it
--
put
it
in
another
way,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
in
view
of
the
national
policy,
which
i
presume
for
a
moment,
it
was
three
miles,
where
an
act
of
admission
says
nothing
at
the
very
least
you
have
to
take
a
good
hard
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
boundaries
in
which
--
in
which
the
state
was
accepted,
proceeded
what
you
regard
as
provisional
policy,
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
--
but
surely,
you
have
got
to
recognize
that
what
is
stated
here
in
terms
of
rights
that
were
given
by
this
act
by
the
united
states'
own
position
do
not
contravene
the
three-mile
doctrine
of
the
national
law.
and
therefore,
what
you're
arguing
here,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
if
the
congress
had
given
directly
that
the
reason
is
best
known
to
itself
will
not
do
inform,
namely
to
give
extraterritorial
rights
to
three
leagues,
you
would
be
the
first
to
say
that
that
doesn't
violate
any
historic
policy
of
the
united
states.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
yet
when
you
come
to
measure
what
you
--
when
you
come
to
measure
or
as
i
keep
coming
back
to
it
all
the
time,
define
the
term
“boundary”.
you
are
superimposing
on
the
term
“boundary”,
a
definition
which
includes
this
ironclad
policy
of
international
law
which,
by
its
own
course,
almost
vitiates
the
grant
which
congress,
you
say,
if
it
is
done
directly
wouldn't
have
had
the
right
to
make
the
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
may
be
true
but
it's
also
true
that
you
cannot
find
any
definition
of
boundary
in
the
act
if
in
terms
of
that
your
view
that
it
was
therefore
(inaudible)
is
to
take
the
whole
picture
and
look
at
it
and
try
to
see
what
that
definition
is
that
is
most
consummate
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
trying
to
achieve.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
is
the
whole
problem.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question
which
is
somewhat
ought
to
be,
at
least
for
my
own
enlightenment.
i'm
sure
that
i
understand
the
government's
position
correctly.
you
do
not
contest,
as
you
concede,
that
as
far
as
texas
is
concern,
it
made
a
claim,
i'm
talking
about
claim
just
as
i
claim
(inaudible)
they
claim
to
a
three-league
boundary
at
the
time
of
its
admission
to
the
union.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
concede
also
that
florida
at
the
time
of
which
readmission
into
the
union
made
such
a
claim
but
deny
it
as
a
claim
that
was
theretofore
made,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
mean,
at
that
time
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
concede
such
a
claim
was
made,
you
deny
the
existence
of
such
a
claim
or
--
for
having
been
made
prior
to
that
time
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
the
case
of
florida.
and
in
the
case
of
louisiana,
mississippi
and
alabama,
you
deny
that
any
such
claim
was
ever
made.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
in
other
words,
you
say
the
--
including
all
islands'
business
which
is
the
predicate
of
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
its
face
is
not
a
--
assertion.
it's
not
an
assertion
on
its
face.
it's
not
an
assertion
of
the
three-league
claim.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
you
find
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
now?
are
those
islands
inhabited?
justice
john
m.
harlan
don't
you
think
you're
overstating
the
position
of
that
when
you
say
that
the
government's
position
was
involved
reading
--
making
the
act
meaningless?
does
the
government
concede
that
if
there
was
an
act
of
congress
in
letting
a
state
to
the
three-league
boundary,
then
notwithstanding
general
and
national
policy
with
respect
to
three
miles,
the
state
would
get
that
submerged
land
act
rights
out
to
the
three-mile
limit
or
three
--
three-league
limit.
you
can't
quite
say
that
the
act
becomes
meaningless,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that
turns
on
whether
you
read
existing
at
the
time
i
was
meaning
the
moment
--
after
the
moment
before.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
your
statement
is
a
little
overstating,
it
seems
to
me
in
fairness
to
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
is
the
state
that
--
that
description
is
it
applicable
to
six
leagues?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you're
saying
six?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
respect
to
the
territorial
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
a
matter
of
construction,
you
may
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
government's
reply
brief
when
it
took
that
position
(inaudible)
alabama
against
texas.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as

this
part
of
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.

as
i
understand
it
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john

(inaudible)

john
m.
harlan
what
goes
in
boundary
claims
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
we
find
those
documents?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
any
of
those
drafts
include
the
original
six-league
claims?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
holland,
am
i
wrong
--
excuse
me
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
is
on
the
basis
--
am
wrong
in
thinking
that
it
is
important
to
your
argument
to
show
that
at
the
time
prior
to
readmission,
the
state
of
florida
had
more
than
a
three-mile
boundary
since
otherwise
if
it
did
not
--
the
effect
of
the
act
of
readmission
would
have
been
to
increase
the
boundary
of
florida
on
readmission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
depends
on
the
island
including
the
island
phraseology.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
can
ask
your
associates
the
dictation
numbers
of
the
records
of
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
that
embraces
the
concept
of
shrinkage
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
there
description
to
the
character
in
the
other
state
constitutions?
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
it
came
to
the
part
of
constitution
readmission,
although
its
claim
had
been
so
described
in
the
historical
period.
it
is
asserted
in
terms
not
of
islands
but
in
terms
of
an
absolute
three-league
boundary
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
1868.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there
was
a
prior
agreed
claim,
wasn't
there,
that
simply
wasn't
tied
to
islands.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
act
of
1872
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
as
justice
whittaker
given,
292
is
--
you
got
something
there
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
assuming
we
had
no
legislative
record
at
all,
simply
the
acts,
the
formal
enactments,
would
you
agree
or
what
would
your
position
be
as
to
whether
what
is
shown
by
those
enactments
would
satisfy
the
requirement
of
approval
in
the
sla?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
it
would
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
your
position
was
that
when
you
read
the
enactments
in
light
of
the
legislative
history,
the
doubt
at
least
arose
or
it
is
clear
that
there
was
no
approval.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
doubt
do
you
--
could
you
articulate
what
the
doubt
is?
forget
the
legislative
history.
what
the
--
what
premise
of
your
doubt
is
looking
at
the
enactments
themselves?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
incorporates
that
the
phraseology
in
the
act
of
1867.
justice
john
m.
harlan
pursuant
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
all
they
said
in
the
discussion
of
the
submerged
land
act
which
is
the
one
we
really
have
to
approve.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
get
down
to
the
question
of
how
quick
they
expected
this
court
to
be
with
reference
to
the
approval
of
act
of
--
by
congress
of
boundary
and
was
there
anything
said
in
the
congress
was
a
report
made
or
did
it
include
anything
about
reconstruction
approval
of
the
act.
was
that
submitted
to
the
congress
or
they
included
that
clause?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
they
were
not
--
they
submitted
to
us.
they
said
the
question
is
when
they
submitted
to
us
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
had
been
an
approval
of
such
a
boundary.
they
did
--
were
we
to
do
that
of
some
basis
or
other
than
the
--
were
we
to
be
very
strict
to
reach
it
and
looking
to
see
what
was
on
approval
by
congress.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
what
are
the
standards
or
the
standards
that
you
suggest
we
should
apply
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
act
of
congress
would
say
"the
constitution
has
to
examined
and
approved",
before
--
representatives
come
in
and
the
representatives
submit
it
as
to
(inaudible).
they
refer
to
the
act
that
has
been
followed
pursuant
to
that
act.
what
standard
would
you
suggest
we
adopt
to
determine
whether
it
come
was
in
the
--
fairly
and
squarely
within
what
congress
said
because
they
have
the
power
to
do
that,
to
admit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
just
as
you
might
approach
it
or
might
reproach
it
you
could
have
two
individuals
making
a
contract.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
did
you
--
as
i
get
to
the
thrust
of
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
basic
approach
here
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
does
not
recognize
any
difference
between
the
covenants
of
the
construction
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
i
am
looking
at
a
matter
of
this
broad
suite
with
importance
against
what
might
be
the
sensible
rules
in
case
of
two
individuals
contracting.
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
read
president
johnson's
veto?
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
of
his
ground
cause
that
they
have
declined
to
accept
the
constitution
of
states
to
show
they
were
wholly
loyal
and
republican
(inaudible).
that
was
one
of
his
grounds
in
veto
and
they
overruled
it.
