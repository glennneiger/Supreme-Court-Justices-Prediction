mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involved
the
issue
of
whether
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
the
lands,
minerals
and
other
things
under
the
sea
within
the
distance
beyond
three
miles
seaward
of
the
low
watermark
or
the
limit
of
inland
waters.
this
court
by
its
decisions
in
the
cases
of
united
states
against
california,
united
states
against
texas
and
united
states
against
louisiana
determined
that
all
of
the
lands,
minerals
and
other
things
under
sea
from
the
low
watermark
and
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters,
belong
to
the
united
states
or
at
least
that
the
united
states
had
paramount
rights
and
power
over
such
properties.
so
that
without
further
action,
there'll
be
no
question
here,
but
what
all
of
that
land
or
those
lands,
properties,
minerals
and
so
forth,
belong
to
the
united
states.
the
question
then
before
the
court
is
what
kind
of
a
relinquishment
the
united
states
may,
to
give
to
the
states
some
rights
in
such
properties
and
the
extent
of
that
relinquishment.
the
only
relinquishment
that
the
court
needs
to
deal
with
at
this
time
is
that
made
by
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953.
and
what
were
the
intents
and
purposes
of
the
congress
in
the
passing
of
that
act.
the
act
is
set
out
on
pages
31
through
34
of
the
government's
brief,
insofar
as
the
crucial
parts
of
it
are
concerned,
that
the
court
needs
to
turn
its
attention
to
during
this
deliberation
and
argument.
the
grant
was
made
by
section
3
that
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
31.
and
it
defines
the
nature
of
the
grant
titled
to
and
ownerships
of
--
of
the
lands,
beneath
navigable
waters
within
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
states
and
so
forth.
and
the
right
and
power
to
administer
such
land
and
properties
and
the
united
states
hereby
releases
and
relinquishes
onto
the
states
such
properties.
then
you
have
to
turn
to
section
2
to
determine
the
definition
of
what
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
are
defined
to
be
under
the
act.
and
that
recites
where,
in
any
case,
the
boundary
line
of
each
such
state
or
in
any
case,
such
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union.
now,
that
will
become
during
this
argument,
a
crucial
language
that
the
court
will
have
to
determine
the
meaning
of
and
if
it
is
not
entirely
clear
from
the
language
itself
what
the
congress
intend,
which
can
be
drawn
from
the
congressional
debates
and
the
other
actions
by
the
congress
before
the
passage
of
the
act.
it
also
goes
on
indeed
to
say,
includes
the
seaward
boundaries
of
a
state
or
its
boundaries
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
any
of
the
great
lakes
as
they
existed
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
as
heretofore
approved
by
the
congress
or
as
extended
or
confirmed
pursuant
to
section
4
hereof.
some
of
the
issues
involved
will
be
what
--
when
at
the
time
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
means.
whether
it
meant
the
time
that
the
state
became
one
of
the
number
of
the
states
of
the
united
states,
whether
it
meant
just
prior
to
that
time,
the
claim
is
made
that
that
language
is
open
to
the
construction
that
meant
prior
to
the
time
it
became
a
member
of
the
union.
or
whether
it
is
that
exact
moment
when
the
state
enters
upon
its
respective
rights,
duties
and
limitations
as
a
member
of
the
union
or
the
united
states
of
america.
then
there
are
some
questions
that
will
be
dealt
with
during
the
argument
in
regard
to
section
4.
section
4
was
intended
and
says
in
so
many
words
that
it
--
purpose
is
to
give
to
the
states
that
do
not
have
a
three-mile
boundary,
the
right
to
extend
their
boundaries
out
to
three
miles
and
confirms
those
boundaries
expressly.
and
then
leaves
open,
the
government
of
the
united
states
contends,
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
they
got
the
beyond
three
miles
as
to
whether
the
states
of
the
gulf
and
that
--
those
were
the
only
states
that
are
allowed
the
opportunity
to
establish
that
they
had
a
boundary
at
the
time
they
became
a
member
of
the
union,
beyond
three
miles
up
to
three
leagues.
the
law
is
very
clear
that
they
limited
the
grant,
so
that
it
could
not
in
any
case,
be
beyond
three
leagues.
but
they
are
given
the
opportunity,
the
--
the
united
states
contends.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
that
it's
clearly
recognized
in
the
briefs
in
this
litigation
now,
that
the
act
does
not
permit
anything
beyond
the
three
leagues.
the
provisions
of
section
4
do
preserve,
the
united
states
concedes
or
agrees
the
right
for
them
to
claim
for
other
purposes
that
they
at
the
time
they
became
a
member
of
the
union,
did
have
a
boundary
beyond
then
--
the
three
leagues.
but
under
the
act,
it
is
recognized
by
the
briefs
of
the
parties
that
no
claim
can
be
validated
or
found
to
be
valid
by
this
court
beyond
three
leagues,
because
it
expressly
limits
it
to
that.
now,
during
the
debates
there
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
--
that
claim
has
been
abandoned
insofar
as
it
would
be
a
claim
that
there
is
any
grant
beyond
three
leagues.
there
is
still
a
contention
by
louisiana
that
it
did
have
rights
or
did
have
boundary
claims
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
that
extended
beyond
three
leagues.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
it
uses
the
other,
merely
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
substantiate
the
three-league
claim.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
page
34,
there
is
a
language
that
nothing
in
this
section
is
to
be
construed
and
that's
in
section
4,
page
34,
at
the
top
of
the
page.
“as
questioning
or
in
any
manner
prejudicing
the
existence
of
any
state's
seaward
boundary
beyond
three
geographical
miles,
if
it
was
so
provided
by
its
constitution
or
laws
prior
to
or
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
or
if
it
has
been
heretofore
approved
by
congress.
the
united
states
takes
the
position
that
that
is
a
no-prejudice
sentence
in
section
4.
and
was
expressly
put
into
the
statute,
so
that
there
would
be
nothing,
no
construction,
conclusions
or
interpretation
drawn
from
this
particular
submerged
lands
act
law
that
would
prejudice,
that
would
go
against
any
state
as
to
its
claim.
but
the
united
states
also
contends,
which
is
contrary
to
the
state's
contention
and
i
want
to
call
it
your
attention
as
we
develop
it
in
the
argument.
that
there
was
no
purpose
to
create
affirmative
rights
by
that
provision
that
it
didn't
declare,
affirm
or
confirm.
now,
the
first
part
of
section
4
does
confirm
such
boundary
claims
up
to
three
miles
that
have
been
made
prior
to
that
time.
and
that
was
the
scheme
of
the
statute.
that
all
of
the
states
that
would
have
a
maritime
boundary,
would
have
such
boundaries
perfected
and
confirmed
either
if
they
had
them
already
or
if
they
further
--
if
they
later
extended
them
to
three
miles.
and
then
the
question
came
as
to
what
about
the
three
leagues.
and
the
congress
carefully
provided
that
this
act
was
not
to
prejudice
such
claims
either
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation
or
any
contentions
under
this
statute
or
any
other
purpose.
but
it
didn't
confirm
--
give
any
validity
or
make
valid
any
such
claims
beyond
three
miles.
now
the
contention
of
the
states
just
stated
and
we'll
develop
in
the
argument,
is
that
this
--
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
validate
such
claims
to
three
leagues.
and
that
by
reading
this
particular
provision
about
no-prejudice,
they
tried
to
take
the
words,
“prior
to,”
or
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
in
that
particular
sentence
and
read
them
back
into
the
other
section
of
section
2,
so
as
to
put,
“prior
to”
in
section
2
where
it
very
clearly
says,
“not
prior
to
at
all,
but
at
the
time
it
became
a
member
of
the
union”.
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
contends
that
congress
did
this
carefully
and
deliberately
trying
to
relate
itself
in
the
no-prejudice,
where
they
could
claim
this
extended
boundary
for
many
other
purposes
in
regard
to
their
state
activities.
but
as
far
as
this
law
was
concerned,
they
said,
“if
you
want
to
come
within
this
law
and
get
three
leagues
or
three
miles,
you
must
comply
with
this
provision.”
the
three
miles
was
--
confirms,
so
we
don't
have
to
bother
about
that.
but
beyond
three
miles,
you
have
to
show
that
at
that
time
you
became
a
member
of
the
union,
you
had
a
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
and
then
you
can
get,
if
you
can
prove
it,
what
you
can
prove
between
three
miles
and
three
leagues
and
no
more.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
after
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
by
reason
of
--
because
at
them
moment
i
think
we
can
deal
with
it
for
a
moment
in
our
thinking
by
taking
the
states
of
alaska
and
hawaii.
now,
in
the
instance
of
alaska,
congress
wanted
to
deal
with
the
question
of
certain
properties,
prior
to
the
time
it
became
admitted
in
the
union.
and
it
said
so,
“certain
governmental
installations
and
other
properties
of
that
kind.”
and
it
expressly
provided
that,
“prior
to”
was
the
measure.
and
it
said
that
that
kind
of
control
of
the
united
states
over
those
properties,
that
it
had,
prior
to,
should
continue
after
the
new
state
very
carefully
done
showing
congress
knows
how
to
do
those
things
exactly
the
way
it
wants
to.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
recall
it
was.
i
can't
--
i
don't
know,
but
i
could
find
that
information
supplied,
if
you
like.
but
they
did
it
precisely,
deal
with
that
question
of
“prior
to”.
now,
here
they
say
with
--
explicitly
in
section
2,
“at
the
time
they
became
a
member
of
the
union
and
on
the
non-prejudice,
they
deal
with
the
words,
prior
to,
in
addition
showing
their
ability
to
distinguish
in
treating
the
two
matters.”
but
in
dealing
with
the
question
of,
at
the
time,
in
trying
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question,
at
the
time
it
became
a
member
of
the
union,
there
are
all
kinds
of
legal
incidents
that
proceed
out
of
that
relationship.
and
this
court
has
passed
in
various
times
in
the
past
upon
the
rights
of
individuals,
of
states
and
of
the
united
states,
proceeding
out
of
that
relationship.
the
moment
before
it
became
a
member
of
the
union,
texas
for
instance,
which
was
an
independent
country,
the
others
were
territories
before
they
became
members
of
the
union.
it
had
the
power
to
regulate
its
own
foreign
affairs.
the
moment
it
became
a
member
of
the
union,
it
lost
that
power
and
it
recognized
it.
in
correspondence
with
the
british
foreign
office,
texas
said
when
they
were
asked,
“what
is
going
to
happen
to
our
treaties
when
you
become
annexed
to
the
united
states,
the
treaties
that
the
republic
of
texas
had
with
--
with
the
--
the
british?”
and
they
responded
and
said,
“of
course,
we'll
live
up
to
our
treaties,
just
as
we
always
have
in
the
past,
up
to
the
time
we've
become
annexed
to
the
united
states.”
and
from
that
time
on,
you
will
have
to
address
yourself
to
the
united
states,
because
it
will
have
charge
of
our
foreign
affairs
from
that
date
on.
now
in
addition
to
that,
citizens
of
the
republic
of
texas
had
certain
rights
under
the
laws
of
that
republic,
certain
provisions
of
their
constitution
and
statutes
that
they're
entitled
to.
they
had
no
rights
to
protection
or
to
privileges
or
benefits
as
citizens
of
the
united
states,
until
they
became
a
member
of
the
union.
at
that
moment,
they
lost
their
position
with
whatever
privileges
and
limitations
they
had
as
citizens
of
texas
and
they
became
automatically
citizens
of
the
united
states.
now,
that
this
republic
of
texas
as
an
independent
country,
had
all
kinds
of
rights
that
they
had,
by
reason
of
annexation
and
they
had
certain
limitations.
they
recognized
one
as
to
their
foreign
affairs.
they
couldn't
conduct
their
foreign
affairs
for
one
second
after
that
moment
when
they
became
a
member
of
the
union.
they
couldn't
call
upon
the
united
states
to
defend
them
against
mexico,
against
the
british
or
any
other
--
of
the
family
of
nations.
until
that
moment,
they
had
to
rely
upon
their
own
forces,
whatever
they
were.
but
at
that
moment,
they
could
start
to
call
upon
the
united
states
for
defense
in
accordance
with
our
constitution.
they
were
entitled
to
representation
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
just
the
second
before
they
weren't
entitled
to
that
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
intend
to
develop
that,
mr.
justice
black,
as
to
what
effect
this
has.
what
i
was
trying
to
deal
at
this
moment
with
the
question
of
this
crucial
time
to
show
that
congress
had
used
great
care
in
fixing
the
time
as
when
it
became
a
member
of
the
union
and
that
can
only
be
actually,
one
instant.
now,
in
dealing
with
boundaries,
i'll
try
to
develop
in
the
legislative
history
that
during
the
debates,
the
members
of
the
congress
both
in
the
house
of
the
senate,
dealt
with
boundaries
as
the
legal
existing
boundaries,
the
boundaries
that
had
extended
over
a
period
of
150
years.
the
constitutional
boundaries
that
were
legal
because
they
had
continued
for
a
long
period
of
years,
the
boundaries
that
would
control
the
jurisdiction
of
causes
of
action,
criminal
cases
and
other
cases
and
the
venue
of
cases.
that
was
the
exact
language
that
were
used
in
trying
to
determine,
trying
to
explain
to
the
senate
and
the
house
just
what
was
intended
by
boundaries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
what
i
was
referring
in
the
150
years,
they
were
dealing
with
the
150
years
that
the
union
had
existed
in
their
--
in
the
debates.
and
they
were
using
it
in
the
context
of
until
the
united
states
against
california,
everybody
thought
that
they
all
had
these
boundaries
for
the
whole
150
years.
some
of
them
of
course,
were
not
in
the
union
that
long.
and
these
were
their
legal
boundaries,
the
--
the
boundaries
of
jurisdiction
and
so
forth.
now
of
course,
with
texas
it's
a
different
situation
and
deals
with
the
republic
of
texas.
they
came
into
the
union
by
annexation
in
1845.
they
were
on
--
in
existence
as
a
republic
insofar
as
the
united
states
recognized
it,
for
a
little
over
nine
years.
and
they
could
only
have
--
as
bound
the
independence
of
mexico
for
that
term.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
didn't
belong
before
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
and
i
was
trying
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
the
position
of
the
united
states.
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
--
nothing
shall
prejudice
and
so
forth,
language
was
to
preserve
the
rights
of
the
states
to
claim
for
any
purposes
and
make
such
claims
in
regard
to
boundaries
beyond
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
and
along
with
the
debates,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
the
theory
that
was
consequently
developed
in
the
debates
was
that
they
were
trying
to
give
to
the
states
or
under
states
rights
and
that
came
up
all
the
time.
they
were
conceived
to
have
prior
to
u.s.
against
california,
and
then
there
was
some
talk
about
--
with
impossible
for
the
congress
or
the
courts
or
anybody
to
change
the
boundary
of
states
after
they
had
once
entered
the
union.
of
course,
there's
no
question
for
what
they
could
have
fixed
it,
while
there
were
territories
or
they
could
fix
it
as
a
matter
of
annexation
or
whatever
they
were
willing
to
take
the
united
states
had
that
power
as
a
matter
of
give
and
take
between
as
--
any
portion
of
territory
that
want
to
come
in
with
the
union.
but
once
it
was
this
--
developed
in
debates,
once
they
entered
the
union,
then
not
--
the
only
the
change
could
be
made
by
reason
of
the
action
of
the
state
legislature
and
the
congress,
agreeing
upon
some
change
in
their
boundaries.
and
so
it's
with
that
concept
of
states
rights
and
the
idea
of
giving
them
what
they
had
conceived
they
always
had.
that
they
were
dealing
with
this
problem
and
looking
at
it
in
that
light,
it
gives
a
better
understanding
of
what
congress
did
in
fact
do
and
what
the
language
means.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
far
as
the
construction
of
this
act
is
concerned.
the
--
taken
in
the
light
of
the
debates,
it
is
clear
that
they
wanted
to
be
free
to
say,
“we've
had
this
boundary
out
to
the
end
of
the
continental
shelf
from
the
time
we
first
entered
the
union.
and
we
want
to
be
able
to
claim
that
for
any
and
all
purposes
of
anytime.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
all
that
weighed
through
the
debates,
it
was
stated
constantly
and
consistently
that
there
was
no
purpose
to
change
any
of
the
boundaries
of
the
states.
there
was
an
opportunity
under
the
first
part
of
section
4
as
i
stated,
“for
the
states
to
--
that
did
not
have
three
mile
maritime
boundary,
to
extend
that
boundary
out
to
three
miles.
and
if
they
had
done
it,
that
was
confirmed.
if
they
had
not
done
it,
it
was
confirmed
by
this
act
if
they
did
it
in
the
future.
but
there
was
no
--
no
provision
of
which
affirmed
or
confirmed
or
validated
anything
beyond
three
miles
whatsoever.
it
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
contemplated
that
they
might
be
able
to
prove
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
they
constantly
said,
“this
doesn't
give
us
anything.
we
don't
get
anything
by
this
enactment
as
far
as
the
distance
between
three
leagues
and
three
miles
is
concerned.
if
we're
able
to
prove
that
we
had
such
a
boundary
and
that
it
was
approved
by
congress
as
far
as
texas
was
concerned
and
florida,
they
will
get
it.
and
senator
holland
did
not
even
indicate
that
louisiana
had
sufficient
proof,
so
she
could
ever
get
three
leagues,
but
senator
long
acting
on
behalf
of
louisiana,
said
we
do
have
such
claims
and
if
we
can
prove
that
we
are
--
had
a
boundary
out
for
three
leagues,
we
should
be
able
to
get
it.
and
senator
holland
said
he
didn't
mean
to
interfere
or
adversely
affect
their
claim
at
all.
but
it
was
stated
time
after
time
that
this
act
did
not
give
anyone,
anything
beyond
three
miles,
not
one
inch,
one
portion
of
an
inch.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
--
the
united
states
concedes
that
there
were
those
in
the
debates
in
the
congress
who
asserted
and
really
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
thought
otherwise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
no.
that
they
had
real
grounds
for
their
claims
and
that
those
claims
could
be
sustained
not
by
someone
claiming
in
the
halls
of
congress,
while
we
have
a
three-league
boundary
and
that's
enough.
but
if
those
people
could
prove
that
they
were
legal,
existing,
valid
claims
under
law
and
it
was
said
time
after
time
that
if
you
want
to
know
what
the
boundary
of
this
states
are
that
claim
something
beyond
three
miles,
you
have
to
find
out
from
the
courts.
that's
where
it
will
be
determined.
and
it
was
even
referred
to
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
manager
of
the
whole
--
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
senator
cordon,
expressly
answered
the
question
of
that
kind.
he
was
asked,
“what
is
going
to
be
the
boundary
of
these
states?
can
you
tell
us?”
he
says,
“no,
i
can't.
it's
whatever
their
legal,
existing,
valid
boundary
is.
and
you
have
to
find
that
up
in
the
supreme
court.”
that
was
answer
given.
so
it's
--
there
--
there
were
those
in
the
congress
who
unquestionably
believed
that
there
are
valid
grounds
that
they
could
prove
to
satisfy
legal
requirements
that
at
least
texas
and
florida
were
entitled
to
three
leagues.
there
were
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
who
raised
all
the
points
that
the
united
states
is
developing
here
very
carefully
and
at
length
and
said
you
can't
get
it.
you're
bound
by
the
three-mile
limitation
of
the
national
boundary
of
the
united
states
and
you
can't
extend
one
foot
beyond.
the
--
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
was
merely
a
division
between
the
state
of
mexico
and
the
--
the
republic
of
texas.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
trying
to
establish
a
three-league
boundary
around
the
gulf.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
does
not.
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
--
the
united
states
does
not
ask
you
to
pass
upon
the
political
question
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
we,
the
united
states,
asked
you
to
accept
the
political
decision
of
the
political
branches
of
the
government
as
to
that
policy
of
three-mile
boundary
and
then
apply
it
to
the
law
to
determine
whether
any
state
could
project
itself
out
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
basic
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
have
a
few
words
in
there
that
i
don't
want
to
accept
[laughs]
as
far
as
secretaries
of
states
are
concerned,
in
what
they've
done
and
said.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
in
light
of
that,
mr.
justice,
if
i
would
accept
the
fact
that
we
do
ask
the
court
to
accept
a
position
that
has
been
declared
for
a
150
years
by
various
secretaries
of
state,
up
to
the
declaration
against
the
claim
of
communist
china
in
1958
for
12
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
in
1958.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
before.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
congress
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
the
congress
would
--
could
be
conceived
to
have
declared
it
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
to
the
extent
that
you
would
find
that
the
congress
intended
that
there
be
three
leagues,
if
you
found
that
anyone
of
the
states
on
the
gulf,
in
fact
legally
had
a
three
league
boundary
or
could
have
had
at
the
time
it
became
a
member
of
the
union.
and
that's
the
limit
that
i
think
you
could
ever
find
in
the
act.
and
i
think,
the
record
is
so
clear
that
the
united
states'
450
years
had
taken
the
position
as
to
texas
and
every
other
point
in
our
--
our
sea
lines,
our
maritime
boundary,
that
we
could
not
have
a
maritime
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
for
45
different
times
when
world
peace
hang
in
a
balance
on
the
position
that
the
united
states
took,
then
i
think
it's
impossible
for
this
court
to
say
that
congress
ever
intended
that
anyone
--
anyone
of
the
states
could
have
a
boundary
beyond
three
miles
if
you
find
the
history
as
such
that
it
was
a
policy
of
the
united
states
government
never
to
have
a
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
i
don't
see
how
this
court
could
ever
say
that
anyone
of
the
states
extended
one
foot
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
united
states,
who
was
still
a
state
of
the
united
states
as
far
as
that
one-fifth
--
foot
was
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
of
course
it
couldn't
have
had
that
at
all,
prior
to
the
submerged
land
act
because
this
court
held
to
the
contrary
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
had
no
rights.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
it
could
have
within
its
maritime
boundary,
without
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
didn't
assert
it
prior
to
that
proclamation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
have
to
rely
on
an
entirely
different
action
by
the
congress.
they
rely
on
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
say
that
the
proclamation
created
that
right
too,
but
it
was
ratified
and
approved
by
the
congress,
but
the
united
states
had
the
right
by
the
president's
action.
it
was
not
a
--
it
was
a
valid
action
by
the
president.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
did
not.
it
was
very
carefully
worded
to
not
interfere
with
the
rights
on
the
sea
of
any
power
whatsoever,
the
proclamation
was.
the
--
our
continental
lands
act
was
exact
--
was
--
provided
the
same
way
and
expressly
by
its
terms,
did
not
interfere
with
any
rights
on
the
sea.
and
it
was
limited
to
extraterritorial
claim
so
recognized
by
the
congress
very
carefully
and
also
by
--
it's
been
recognized
generally
by
the
--
the
nations
of
the
world.
that
such
limited
claims
cannot
be
--
can
be
made
and
are
not
boundary
claims
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
they
do.
and
i
don't
think
that
claim
is
open
to
them.
we
argue
it
carefully
and
at
length
in
our
brief
and
i'll
try
to
tell
you
why
i
don't
think
it's
open
to
you.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
only
thing
i
don't
you
to
say
is
--
is
oversimplified,
because
i
think
there
is
an
element
of,
“at
the
time
of,”
when
it
became
a
member
of
the
union.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now
what
is
--
what
do
they
mean
by
boundary?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr,
justice.
i
thought
that
was
inherent
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
question,
but
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
there
isn't
any
question
in
the
history
of
our
country
that
some
of
the
states
when
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed,
did
not
have
their
boundaries
extended
beyond
the
coastline.
and
they
--
in
section
4,
they
were
expressly
given
the
power
to
make
the
extension
to
three
miles,
if
they
saw
fit
to
do
so.
but
the
--
one
of
the
great
problems
in
the
case
is
what
congress
meant
by
the
term
"boundary",
there
isn't
any
question
about
it.
and
if
you
looked
at
the
language
itself,
i
think
you
would
have
to,
without
going
further,
you
would
have
to
concede
that
boundary
is
a
technical
term
that
has
been
used
in
the
history
of
the
nations
throughout
the
world
to
mean
the
area
that
you
claim
control
over
for
general
jurisdictional
purposes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
--
i
can
see
that,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
that
affects
what
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
position
is
in
regard
to
what
the
boundary
is.
the
--
the
boundary
has
always
been
regarded
as
what
you
claim
that
you
can
keep
the
other
fellow
out
of.
and
that's
what
makes
the
trouble.
now,
we
don't
care
when
we
say
--
when
some
country
says
we're
going
to
establish
some
area
of
100
miles
out,
like
russia
did.
we
do
in
--
from
their
coast
and
also
the
coast
of
alaska,
we
protested.
why
do
we
protest?
because
it
interfered
with
the
rights
of
our
navy,
our
ships,
private
ships,
merchant
ships,
our
citizens
who
wanted
to
fish
and
anybody
else
that
wanted
to
go
within
that
area.
we
wouldn't
have
cared
to
react,
if
they
hadn't
tried
to
interfere
with
our
people.
but
that's
what
they
were
doing.
they
said,
your
people
stay
out
of
a
distance
a
100
miles
from
those
coasts.
and
we
said,
we
protested
immediately.
we
said
that
we
would
not
follow
any
such
decree
or
ultimatum
that
the
three-mile
was
the
rule
of
the
world.
it
was
all
we
recognized
for
ourselves.
it's
all
we
ever
recognize
for
any
other
country
and
therefore,
we
would
insist
upon
our
people
having
rights
within
the
area
up
to
three
miles.
now
that's
what
an
issue
about
boundary.
and
then
another
case,
i'll
show
you
back
in
1805
the
case
of
vienna
(ph).
it's
a
case
decided
by
lord
(inaudible).
and
in
that
case,
it
was
an
action
by
the
british
government
and
in
regard
to
whether
or
not
a
privateer
had
a
right
to
take
certain
goods
and
properties
off
a
ship
within
the
three-mile
limit
of
louisiana
near
the
mississippi
river.
and
the
british
high
court
of
aden
said,
“the
united
states
has
asserted
general
jurisdiction
for
three
miles.”
congress
has
done
that
too
and
they've
referred
to
the
statute.
"everybody
knows,"
that's
the
language
of
lord
(inaudible)
and
he
was
one
of
the
great
judges.
this
isn't
our
court,
this
is
the
british
court
dealing
with
this
problem.
everybody
knows
that
the
marital
--
maritime
boundary
that's
recognized
generally
throughout
the
world
is
three
miles.
this
vessel
was
taken
within
the
three-mile
limits.
it
can
not
be
kept.
you
have
to
turn
the
goods
back.
now
there's
a
basic
issue.
and
it
isn't
just
talk
about
what
our
boundary
is
and
the
importance
of
it.
it's
a
great
issue
of
personal
rights,
governmental
rights
and
what
you
can
do
within
the
area.
now,
just
imagine
for
a
minute
what
would
be
the
effect,
if
we
had
a
twelve-mile
limit
throughout
the
world.
80%
of
all
of
the
lighthouses,
bouie,
signal
for
all
kinds
for
shipping
throughout
the
world,
could
not
even
be
seen.
and
many
areas
would
only
be
barely
open
because
of
the
principle
of
straights
being
available.
a
very
large
circle
of
the
oceans
would
be
unavailable
not
to
the
great
government
of
the
united
states,
but
to
mr.
american
citizen
who
wants
to
be
able
the
sail
his
vessels.
small
craft,
that's
one
of
his
privileges
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
larger,
merchant
marine,
throughout
our
battleships,
cruisers,
aircraft
and
airplane
carriers
--
aircraft
carriers
and
even
our
aircraft
can't
go
across
the
boundary
--
the
maritime
boundary
of
another
country
without
violating
a
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
doesn't
apply
to
aircraft,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
it
would
apply
just
to
ships.
but
the
small
craft
would
have
the
difficulty
of
being
able
to
find
anchorage
even
of
twelve
miles
in
many
areas,
to
be
able
to
have
the
opportunity
to
run
their
vessels
in
that
area
and
have
it
with
any
safety.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
innocent
passage
is
not
countable
to
the
right
of
their
own
government
having
their
territorial
boundary
up
to
that
point
and
the
protections
that
are
involved
in
that.
i
(voice
overlap)
believe
that
couldn't
any
kind
of
foreign
war
vessels
come
into
that
area,
as
far
as
our
ships
were
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
skiriotes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice,
maybe
i'll
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
in
answering
your
question,
there
is
no
question
that
what
if
congress
had
said
that
they
shall
have
the
right
to
explore
these
minerals
out
to
three
leagues
without
reference
to
any
boundary.
congress
had
that
power.
court
in
alabama
against
texas
and
congress
could
have
done
it
and
we
would
not
be
here
contesting
the
matter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
you're
--
we
think
that
in
applying
the
law,
you're
required
to
so
find
because
we
say
that
that
position
was
taken
by
the
united
states
for
150
years,
it's
an
important
position
in
the
conduct
of
this
government.
it
wasn't
taken
just
as
with
regard
to
some
area
that
we
should
not
exercise
general
jurisdiction
over.
it
was
because
we
did
exercise
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
question
is
what
boundary
means.
and
if
the
congress
had
said,
“without
regard
to
boundary,”
i
think
that's
inherent
in
your
question.
without
regard
to
boundary,
the
state
shall
be
able
to
explore
out
to
three
leagues.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
that
will
be
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
concede
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
they
thought
it
was
substantial
enough
so
that
they
would
give
them
an
opportunity
to
prove
it
according
to
law.
and
i
think
congress
does
that
manifold
number
of
times
that
this
court
is
familiar
with,
in
the
court
of
claims.
time
after
time,
congress
doesn't
see
fit
to
resolve
a
controversy
in
regard
to
states
or
individuals
in
this
country.
but
they
say
you
claim
you
have
certain
rights,
we'll
allow
the
action
to
be
brought
in
the
court
of
claims.
you
prove
it
up.
if
you
can
establish
those
rights
under
law,
you'll
get
a
judgment.
and
we'll
appropriate
the
money
to
pay
it,
but
by
saying
that,
they
don't
say
we
find
that
you've
got
any
such
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
this
very
thing
about
the
--
the
maritime
boundary
in
the
united
states
being
three
miles
was
raised
during
the
debates
as
an
element
that
would
preclude
the
establishment
of
any
such
claims.
it
was
raised
in
the
hearings
both
by
the
state
department
representative
and
other
people
who
testified.
the
case
--
the
cases
of
this
court
were
put
in
the
record.
the
minority
reports
of
--
of
the
committee
said
in
so
many
words
that
there
was
nothing
to
the
--
either
the
texas
claim
or
the
florida
claim.
now,
i
don't
think
that
precludes
them.
congress
didn't
preclude
them
because
of
that.
but
it
did
say
they
had
to
prove
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
the
effect
of
embarrassment
--
international
relations
is
an
element
that
you
and
the
rest
of
the
court
would
properly
take
into
account,
under
your
decisions
in
the
past
in
considering
the
decision
of
a
political
question,
like
the
boundary
--
maritime
boundary
of
the
united
states.
the
--
what
i
was
trying
to
deal
with
in
regard
to
boundary
was
that
it
is
not
something
that
can
be
dealt
with
lightly
is
what
i
was
meaning
as
far
as
the
interest
of
our
people
and
our
country
are
concerned.
and
that
the
assertion
of
a
maritime
boundary
by
the
united
states
was
not
done
as
a
mere
whim
or
by
starting
with
jefferson
and
then
on
down
to
years
by
some
very
great
men,
who
were
the
secretaries
of
state
and
under
some
great
presidents
throughout
the
years
and
at
times
when
we
were
pretty
little
fellows
to
be
standing
up
against
britain
and
france
and
--
and
spain
and
other
great
powers
that
we
were
saying
now,
you
can't
have
more
than
three
miles.
we
don't
allow
it.
don't
take
it
ourselves
and
we
don't
allow
it
to
anybody
else.
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
trying
to
show
that
it's
not
any
idle
thing
that
our
government
was
doing.
and
i'm
trying
also
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
word,
boundary,
you
have
to
apply
to
it,
what's
ordinarily
meant
by
boundary.
now,
if
i
would
try
to
say
this
boundary
in
the
state
of
nebraska
is
--
this
court
comes
to
in
the
state
of
kansas
and
then
i
would
try
to
say,
now,
we
--
we
go
over
there
in
hot
pursuit.and
we
have
a
right
to
go
over
there
and
--
and
check
different
things
with
kansas,
but
--
and
so
that
makes
up
the
boundary
clear
out
there
a
part
of
kansas.you
just
laughed
me
out
of
court.
but
--
and
that's
what
i'm
saying
--
this
laws
that
--
it
didn't
say
boundary
that
you
might
--
congress
might
say
someday
that
you
could
go
out
and
inspect
vessels
as
a
part
of
the
smuggling
that
is
recognized
as
the
exception
and
nullified
maritime
boundary
by
the
nations
of
the
world,
when
we've
done
it,
we've
said
to
the
other
nations
we're
not
trying
to
encroach
upon
your
rights
at
all.
a
maritime
boundary
is
the
same
thing
as
though
it
was
so
much
land
as
far
as
though,
a
boundary
of
a
country
is
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
they
said
the
boundary
between
our
countries
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
shall
commence
at
a
point
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande.
but
in
the
same
year
that
the
treaty
was
made,
great
britain
said
to
the
united
states,
“do
you
mean
that
that
changes
the
boundary?
are
you
claiming
beyond
three
miles?”
and
the
united
said
--
states
said,
“no,
we
are
not.
we
did
not
in
any
way
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
interfere
with
your
rights.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
that
--
that
very
action
of
the
united
states
shows
it
does.
years
would
unite
the
people
who
have
made
the
treaty.
now,
i
make
a
contract
with
mr.
x
and
in
the
same
year
i
say
to
you
--
to
another
party
that
this
contract
means
so
and
so
and
the
other
party
who's
the
other
contracting
party
like
mexico,
said
to
the
british
exactly
the
same
thing.
this
doesn't
mean
that
it's
anything
beyond
three
--
three-mile
boundary
at
all.
this
doesn't
interfere
with
your
rights.
it
didn't
at
all
like
a
boundary.
then
you'd
say
to
me,
“you
made
your
contract.
you
interpret
it.”
you
have
said
this
isn't
any
kind
of
a
boundary.
you
say
it
doesn't
interfere
with
other
people's
rights.
that's
what
it
means.
it
seems
to
me
that's
--
that's
ordinary
contract
law.
now,
that's
what
the
two
contracting
parties
said
about
this
guadalupe
hidalgo
treaty
within
the
same
year
upon
inquiry
by
a
foreign
power
that
had
a
right
to
inquire
because
it
was
introduced
in
the
--
on
which
the
suit
affect
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
now
proceed
through
the
debates.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
where
they
--
they
contend
that
the
action
of
the
united
states
in
inserting
control
over
the
area
beyond
three
miles
for
the
continental
shelf
is
some
kind
of
a
boundary.
and
that
they
have
the
right
to
take
advantage
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
--
that
we
are
mr.
justice.
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
think
that
they
say
that
by
implication
at
least,
they
say
that
when
you
--
when
the
united
states
has
a
provision
of
its
laws
that
permits
it
to
go
out
four
leagues
into
the
gulf
in
regard
to
smuggling,
that
that
establishes
that
kind
of
--
that
establishes
the
boundary,
that
they
can
take
advantage
of
under
this
law.
and
the
united
states'
position
historically,
time
after
time,
has
been
with
that,
isn't
the
boundary
at
all.
that
is
a
matter
of
accommodation
between
the
nations
involved
and
is
only
done
as
to
ships
coming
into
our
ports.
but
they
still
assert
that
that
makes
some
kind
of
a
boundary
for
them
to
try
to
take
advantage
of
under
this
law.
i
wouldn't
want
to
state
otherwise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
would
say
in
this
regard
that,
if
the
secretary
of
state
with
this
court
recognized
has
the
power
to
pass
on
the
political
question,
would
say
to
this
court
that
our
--
our
maritime
boundary
is
one
mile
and
has
been
for
a
150
years,
this
court
wouldn't
have
to
accept
that,
because
it
would
be
a
misrepresentation
of
fact.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
true,
in
accordance
to
your
cases.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
if
--
but
we
put
one
thing
more
in
that,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
we
say
that
if
at
the
time
it
became
a
member
of
the
union,
the
state
would
say
our
boundary
and
the
only
state
who
could
apply
to
would
be
texas,
because
the
others
were
territories.
they're
creatures
of
the
united
states
and
they
couldn't
possibly
by
definition,
have
an
inch
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
united
states.
now,
they're
our
right.
under
any
kind
of
--
can
apply
law
to
the
question,
there
are.
but
as
to
texas,
it's
an
independent
republic
that
we
recognize.
so
then,
if
texas
had
three
leagues,
which
we
question
that
they
--
we
say
they
didn't
even
have
that
anyway,
under
the
law,
under
international
law
and
everything
else.
they
hadn't
established
it
so
far.
but
assuming
for
a
moment
for
argument
that
they
had,
we
say
at
the
moment
they
became
a
part
of
the
united
states,
they
were
reduced
to
what
the
policy,
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
well,
i
think
it's
at
the
moment.
you
see,
because
all
of
the
incidents
of
the
statehood
proceed
from
that
moment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
let's
see
--
let's
look
to
past
tense
because
of
course,
that's
happened
to
all
of
them.
you
wouldn't
say
it
becomes
--
so
you
have
to
use
some
--
a
past
tense
to
describe
an
event
that's
already
occurred.
but
you
see,
they're
trying
to
take
the
theory,
if
you
--
if
you
looked
at
the
debates,
they're
trying
to
take
the
idea
that
at
the
moment
they
came
under
the
union,
they
had
something
or
they
didn't
have
something.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
--
that's
the
claim
of
some
of
the
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
the
state
has
--
i
think
that
this
court
had
to
pass
on
the
question
and
i
was
here
suing
back
in
1845
and
said
that
at
the
moment
texas
--
the
paper
was
signed
by
the
president
approving
the
act
of
annexation,
the
joint
resolution
and
i
was
suing
upon
my
rights.
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
i
think
you
would
say
at
that
moment
i
received
certain
rights,
it
didn't
happen
the
moment
after,
it
happened
the
moment
that
law
became
in
effect.
so
i
think
that
that's
when
the
union
--
it
becomes
a
member
of
the
union.
it
doesn't
become
a
member
of
the
union
the
moment
after
it
became
a
member.
it
becomes
a
--
at
the
moment
it
became.
that's
the
moment
when
all
of
these
rights
changed.
now,
the
republic
of
texas
couldn't
have
--
say
its
congress
acted
one
moment
after
it
had
passed
the
law
or
--
or
at
the
very
moment
that
the
law
was
signed.
the
--
the
pen
was
just
lifted
off
the
paper.
would
that
act
be
found
valid
by
this
court?
it
seems
to
me
you'd
say,
no.
the
--
all
of
these
legal
relationships
have
to
date
from
the
moment
it
happens.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
mean
[laughs]
--
if
you
mean
all
the
things
we're
arguing
about,
i'm
sure
it's
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
that
means
that
they
have
--
would
have
had
to
ascertain,
what
is
that
to
include
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
nobody
did
at
that
time
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
this
court
said
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
a
little
unclear
about
your
language,
mr.
justice,
but
if
it
--
if
it
clearly
said
that
they
should
have
the
right
to
explore
out
the
three
leagues
without
reference
to
boundaries
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
i
wouldn't
be
here
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you're
giving
me
a
question
that's
pretty
difficult
because
you're
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
court's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
this
court
has
said
that
they
couldn't
have
such
a
right.
they
had
no
such
a
right,
never
had.
how
can
i
say
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
sir.
it
made
a
great
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
never
--
it
--
it
clearly
said,
it
never
intended
to
overrule
the
cases.
it
was
creating
rights
that
never
existed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
this
court
says
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
as
to
technical,
but
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
therefore,
it
was
giving
them,
but
it
--
it
defined
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
it
seems
to
me,
if
i
want
to
grant
somebody
half
a
mile
lot
and
i
described
it,
this
court
shouldn't
be
saying,
i
granted
my
whole
lot.
it
should
be
following
what
i
--
my
grant
was.
and
you
also
have
the
propositions
firmly
established
in
this
court
that
you
construe
all
grants
by
the
united
states
--
in
favor
of
the
united
states
and
against
the
grantee.
they're
bound
by
that
too.
now,
what
do
--
what
was
the
intention
of
congress?
when
it
used
the
word,
boundary,
was
it
going
to
use
some
freak
idea
that's
not
commonly
used
by
the
congress?
congress
has
dealt
with
boundaries
for
150
years.
often
than
not,
i
don't
the
first
time
that
--
but
i
know
early
they
had
to
deal
with
them
and
what
was
affected.
when
it
said
boundary,
did
it
mean
something
other
than
people
do
generally?
did
it
mean
that
you
could
go
out
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
or
that
if
you
just
happen
to
let
it
--
the
united
states
go
out
on
occasion
and
didn't
try
to
exclude
anybody
from
the
area
that
that
was
the
boundary?
i
can't
conceive
that
this
court
would
read
any
such
thought
into
congress'
acts.
congress
was
--
must
have
been
dealing
with
boundary
and
i'm
not
--
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
legislative
debates
that
will
clearly
show
what
was
intended,
but
without
that,
boundary
must
be
the
--
i
think
it's
only
fair
that
you
assume,
congress
of
the
united
states
was
dealing
as
a
--
as
deliberative
body
that's
trying
to
fairly
accomplish
a
certain
job.
and
it's
trying
to
deal
with
words
like
people
ordinarily
deal
with,
not
with
freak
attribution
or
constructions
or
unusual
conclusions
or
ideas
that
aren't
ordinarily
in
them.
the
issue
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
have
to
add
just
a
little
to
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
that
--
i
think
that
the
term,
boundary
is
a
word
of
art,
i
agree
with
that.
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
maritime
boundary
by
law
is
imposed
down
upon
it.
and
the
state
can
have
a
boundary
less
than
the
maritime
boundary,
as
some
of
them
did
only
assert
a
boundary
out
of
the
coast.
but
they
never
can
have
one
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
but
i
just
want
to
clarify
the
point,
that
--
but
i
--
the
factual
situation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo,
i
think
is
the
one
that
you're
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now
it's
a
construction
of
texas
and
the
other
defendant
states.
but
that
meant
that
the
boundaries
should
run
around
the
coast
for
three
leagues.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
united
states
had
--
has
answered
that
question
by
the
government
by
saying
that
that
was
the
commencement
of
the
point
--
a
division
between
the
countries
and
did
not
mean
any
boundary
around
a
coast
or
gulf.
mexico
said
exactly
the
same
thing,
the
same
year,
both
of
them
the
same
year
to
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
both
of
them
told
the
british
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
have
denied
that.
the
government
denied
it,
the
same
time
mexico
denied
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
position
was
that
this
was
a
relationship
between
these
two
countries
in
establishing
the
boundary
between
the
two
countries
and
that
it
was
not
an
assertion
by
either
country
that
they
had
any
control
against
the
rest
of
the
world
or
against
each
other
of
three
leagues
in
the
gulf.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
all
of
that
time
mexico
had
a
boundary
line
by
a
statute
for
three
miles.
they
never
asserted
any
nine-mile
boundary
until
1935,
87
years
later.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
as
a
boundary
line
it
was
construed
by
our
state
department
as
being
from
that
point
and
not
to
include
any
maritime
boundary
running
around
the
coast
or
gulf,
either
way.
and
that
was
--
construction
was
made
during
the
same
year.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
no
question
about
that.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
could
be
the
case.
it
was
asserted
by
the
united
states
constantly
that
it
didn't
interfere
with
anybody
else's
rights.
it
wasn't
any
claims
for
a
general
jurisdiction
for
the
area.
and
it
was
so
asserted
by
mexico
as
i
said
and
when
mexico
did
assert
a
nine-mile
boundary,
87
years
later,
the
united
states
protested
it
vigorously.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
would
have
to.
both
countries
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
with
--
with
regard
to
what
boundary
was
to
mean
according
to
--
assuming
that
you
--
it
isn't
clear
from
the
language
of
the
act
and
you
go
to
the
debates.
then,
we
have
the
language
of
the
drafter
of
bills
under
holland
and
the
other
senators
and
congressmen
in
which
they
repeatedly
deal
with
what
boundary
is.
and
senator
holland
said
that's
--
boundary
is
the
area
of
general
jurisdiction.
the
--
in
1794,
the
united
states
congress
asserted
jurisdiction
for
a
--
for
distance
of
three
miles.
and
that
act
has
been
on
enforced
on
our
books
at
all
times,
except
one
year
when
it
was
dropped
by
inadvertence.
they
also
said
that
they
were
--
the
boundary
was
the
general
jurisdiction
for
legal
cases,
the
venue
of
cases
and
other
actions.
that
it
was
the
historical
boundary
because
it
was
the
legal
boundary.
the
legal
boundary
that
had
existed
for
a
period
years,
it
was
the
lands
within
their
territorial
waters
and
that
--
that
was
what
they
were
trying
to
restore,
that
they
were
the
legal
boundaries
of
the
states
that
had
for
150
years.
now,
all
of
that
language
at
the
time
they
were
trying
to
get
this
act
passed
in
the
congress,
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
all
of
the
other
claims
now,
of
some
other
kind
of
a
boundary.
that
a
boundary
set
for
the
purposes
of
smuggling,
inspection
of
ships
was
sufficient.
that
isn't
a
general
jurisdiction
boundary
at
all.
the
united
states
has
never
asserted
general
jurisdiction,
jurisdiction
of
cases
over
in
such
boundary.
our
jurisdiction
in
cases
we've
asserted
for
the
three
miles.
so
throughout
our
history,
they
have
described
the
boundary
they
were
talking
about
exactly
in
the
manner
you
describe
the
maritime
boundary
of
a
country.
that's
exactly
what
would
be
involved
in
the
maritime
boundary
of
the
united
states.
and
furthermore,
they
raised
these
very
questions
about
whether
any
--
any
state
could
have
a
boundary
that
extended
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
united
states.
that
was
raised
in
the
debate.
whether
or
not,
the
mere
transmittal
of
a
copy
of
the
statute
of
texas
of
1836,
asserting
three
leagues,
could
ever
be
an
establishment
of
a
boundary,
but
didn't
have
any
legal
effect.
it
wasn't
enough.
so
that
the
--
the
basic
issues
and
also
the
fact
of
the
effect
of
a
maritime
boundary
of
the
united
states
and
the
claims
of
the
united
states
through
limitation
of
three
miles,
the
effect
that
would
have
on
any
other
state
and
whether
or
not,
a
state
that
had,
like
texas
as
a
republic,
a
serving
of
a
statute
of
three-league
boundary,
came
into
the
union
--
did
it
lose
that
right,
if
they
--
and
had
to
claim
prior
to
that
time,
by
coming
into
the
union
didn't
it
have
to
be
subject
to
the
united
states?
now
here,
texas
is
and
she
tells
britain
at
this
very
time
that
it
seems
to
me
a
historical
event
of
the
greatest
importance.
britain
asked
about
her
treaties
and
the
effect
of
it.
what
force
and
effect
they
might
have
after
she
is
annexed?
and
she
says,
“i
can't
control
our
foreign
policy
after
we're
annexed
to
the
united
states.
you
have
to
ask
the
united
states
from
the
moment
we
become
annexed,
about
the
foreign
policy.”
would
it
be
possible,
say
we
had
a
conflict
with
--
with
texas
foreign
policy
and
texas
had
a
certain
policy
toward
mexico
just
a
moment
before
she
entered
the
union.
and
that
was
--
and
our
policy
toward
mexico
was
peaceful
and
hers
was
some
conflict.
wouldn't
it
be
accepted
immediately
that
she
was
blanketed
under
our
foreign
policy,
the
moment
she
entered
the
union?
doesn't
that
have
to
proceed
as
a
matter
of
--
of
legal
interest
and
application?
the
same
is
true
with
all
of
our
foreign
policies.
the
same
is
true
with
our
constitution,
our
laws.
she
would
have
to
recognize
and
has
been
applied
as
to
other
instances
over
the
years.
that
automatically,
the
united
states
doesn't
have
to
go
around
to
every
state
when
it's
taken
into
the
union
or
any
other
territory
and
say
now,
“from
now
on,
you
--
you
must
remember,
you
have
to
follow
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
you
can't
continue
to
have
your
own.
your
policy
doesn't
continue
right
on
and
the
other
48
states
don't
have
to
live
by
your
foreign
policy,
too.
you
only
got
one.”
that's
by
definition
in
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
that's
recognized
as
an
extraterritorial
claim
by
the
congress,
by
president
truman,
when
he
issued
the
proclamation,
by
the
other
nations
in
the
world
and
it's
recognized
the
claim
that
the
legitimate
would
be
made
without
any
encroachment
or
incursion
upon
the
other
nations
of
the
world.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it's
a
little
more
than
that.
i
think
that
there's
recognized
--
if
--
i
--
i
want
to
try
to
make
the
distinction.
if
we
would,
for
instance,
try
to
assert
the
right
to
the
continental
shelf
on
the
other
side
of
the
caribbean,
close
to
other
countries.
i
think
that
the
other
countries
of
the
world,
the
nations
of
the
world
would
feel
that
we
have
no
right
to
make
any
extraterritorial
claim
to
exploit
the
minerals
there.
that
is
they
associate
the
legitimacy
of
such
an
extraterritorial
claim
as
being
related
to
the
fact
that
that
continental
shelf
is
adjacent
to
our
country.
so
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
answering
the
questions
there.
i
wanted
to
clarify
that
you
couldn't
just
--
we
couldn't
just
reach
out
and
say
the
british
isles'
continental
shelf
belongs
to
us.
and
the
other
nations
wouldn't
recognize
that,
of
course.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'd
say
it
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
it's
recognized
in
two
--
or
three
--
three
reasons.
first,
it's
recognized
by
the
nations
of
the
world,
international
law.
say
it
doesn't.
second,
the
president
very
carefully
said
it
did.
third,
the
congress
very
carefully
said
it
didn't.
so
that,
i
think,
those
are
--
or
as
political
questions,
they're
controlling
on
the
court,
if
you
find
that's
true.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
say
that
if
the
congress
had
clearly
indicated
that
by
a
boundary,
it
meant
that
they
should
have
the
rights
to
three
leagues,
regardless
of
whatever
the
maritime
boundary
the
united
states
was,
then
commerce
could
have
done
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
we're
trying
to
say,
the
united
states'
position
is
that
at
the
time
meant,
when
it
got
in
the
door.
that
it
--
that
it
had
all
these
incidence
of
statehood
and
it
lost
its
position
as
an
independent
power,
that
when
it
became
a
state
of
the
union,
it
could
only
have
a
boundary
that
was
coextensive
with
the
boundary
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
say
that
the
boundary
has
to
be
the
territorial
boundary.
now,
if
you
would
find
that
congress
really
didn't
mean
what
they
said
it
meant,
when
the
debates
--
what
boundary
ordinarily
means,
that
there
was
some
idea
or
intention
to
have
an
unusual
boundary
and
change
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
some
way,
so
that
--
then
you
would
find
that
the
three
mile
boundary
of
the
united
states
was
not
intended
to
preclude
now,
but
you
still
have
the
problem.
that
congress
couldn't
change
it
all,
the
boundary
as
of
that
time,
so
if
you
would
interpret
the
law,
as
we
think
the
only
way
it
could
be
interpreted,
that
congress
meant
that
it
was
whatever
boundary
they
had
at
that
time
that
controls.
the
only
boundary
they
could
possibly
have
was
within
the
united
states.
and
that
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
was
three
miles
and
therefore,
theirs
had
to
be
three
miles.
then,
even
though
congress
would
want
to
do
something
else
it
would
have
to
say
it
differently.
it
couldn't
say
it
the
way
it
has
and
make
that
possible
because
it
can't
change
what
the
facts
were
back
in
1845,
when
texas
came
in
the
union.
and
you
would
be
finding
what
the
league
--
what
the
law
is.
and
if
they
only
had
a
boundary
out
--
the
united
states
had
a
boundary
of
three
miles,
ab
initio,
it's
got
to
be
that
no
state
can
have
a
boundary
on
each
beyond
that
or
a
fraction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
question
of
what
they
could.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
they
didn't
intend
to.
they
didn't
do
it
by
definition
or
terms
and
it
can't
--
they
used
a
measure
deliberately.
now,
in
the
debates,
you
--
if
you
examine
and
i'm
going
to
call
your
attention
to
--
if
--
during
the
balance
of
my
argument.
it
was
very
clear.
they
said
time
after
time
the
manager
of
the
bill,
the
various
proponents
are
active
for
it.
we're
not
adding
anything
to
what
these
people
have.
not
one
thing.
they
either
had
it
or
they
don't.
that
was
the
whole
concept
of
the
bill.
now,
the
political
aspect
of
this
matter
was
quite
different.
if
you
examine
the
position
of
the
legislators
and
you
have
them
saying,
“we
don't
care
what
your
rights
were
back
at
that
time.
we're
going
to
give
these
gulf
states
something
we
don't
give
to
other
45
--
43
states.”
none
of
them
wanted
any
part
of
that,
as
far
as
the
bulk
of
the
congress
is
concerned.
the
only
thing
they
were
willing
to
consider
was
that
if
they
had
something
under
law,
they
were
willing
to
give
them
a
chance
to
get
it,
up
to
three
--
three
leagues,
which
would
be
a
special
provision
for
these
gulf
states
represent
invaluable
in
its
worth.
and
it
would
be
taken
from
the
united
states.
no
question,
but
at
that
moment,
this
court
had
held
that
they're
all
going
to
the
united
states.
so,
i
think
you
have
to
take
that
into
consideration
in
trying
to
interpret
what
congress
did,
because
it's
in
--
and
they
said
it,
a
good
many
times,
but
it
--
it's
quite
a
difference
between
congress
saying,
“texas
claims
are
fraudulent.
there's
nothing
to
them.
nevertheless,
we'll
give
them
all
these
wealth.
louisiana's
claims
are
fraudulent.
there's
nothing
to
them,
still
we'll
give
them."
they
didn't
say
that.
they
said,
“if
they
can
prove
it,
we
are
not
giving
them
anything
in
this
law
beyond
three
miles,
except
the
chance
to
prove
it.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
but
they've
got
to
prove
it
according
to
this.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
have
to
prove
it
according
to
the
definitions
that
congress
laid
down.
they're
not
--
they
didn't
say
the
boundary
that
is
asserted
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
nothing
like
that.
they
asserted
that
to
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
with
the
state
of
texas
as
an
example,
if
they
claimed
three
leagues
and
there
--
no
question
what
they
did
by
that
statute
in
1836.
at
all
times
from
1793
down
to
that
date
and
all
times
beyond
that
date
to
the
present
time,
the
united
states
said
to
most
of
the
great
powers
of
the
world,
“none
of
you
can
claim
beyond
three
miles.
we
won't
recognize
it.”
now,
if
texas
was
going
to
be
given
three
leagues
that
meant
as
long
as
texas
was
an
independent
power
that
texas
had
three
leagues
against
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
--
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
all
of
its
activities,
both
so
far
as
the
defense
of
the
country
was
concerned
and
otherwise,
against
every
citizen
so
far
as
fishing
was
concerned
and
every
other
right.
now,
of
course,
the
matter
of
submerged
lands
was
never
mentioned
back
in
those
days,
it
never
came
up,
but
how
in
the
world
can
you
say
that
this
country
when
it
was
asserting
that
position
at
the
risk
of
war,
as
this
described
in
detail,
and
the
communications
by
secretaries
of
states
over
the
years
had
any
intention
to
recognize
a
three-league
claim
on
the
part
of
the
--
a
little
republic
of
texas,
when
it
would
risk
war
in
asserting
that
no
one
of
the
great
powers
could
have
such
a
claim.
and
she
wouldn't
assert
it
for
herself.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
maybe
i
will
strike
that
out.
[laughter]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
the
--
the
history
of
--
was
before
the
committee
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
government
thought
it
was
not
asserting
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
an
unusual
claim.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
it
--
the
testimony
of
the
state
department
was
that
this
was
clearly
within
international
law
and
was
next
to
territorial
claim.
it
would
not
interfere
with
other
nations
or
be
protested.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
so
speculative.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
reason
i
have
difficulty
with
the
second
question,
mr.
justice,
is
that
we
have
had
times
when
we
protested
against
the
inspection
of
vessels.
for
instance,
with
--
with
russia
when
they
asserted
the
right
to
inspect
vessels
out
12
miles
was
really
related
to
smuggling
or
at
least
that's
what
they
claim.
we
did
protest
against
it,
saying
they
were
limited
to
three
miles.
they
wound
up
claiming
the
whole
12
miles
as
general
jurisdiction
and
a
right
and
then
apparently
our
government
thought
that
might
be
the
outcome
if
we
didn't.
so
that
--
and
then
we
had
an
assertion
by
mexico
of
20
kilometers
at
one
time
and
we
protested
that.
and
then
they
said,
“well,
that
same
thing
you're
doing
four
leagues.”
and
he
said,
“well,
we
don't
do
it
that
way.
we
only
inspect
vessels
that
are
coming
to
our
ports
and
it's
a
matter
of
convenience.”
and
so
it
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
you're
doing
while
you're
just
stopping
them
and
trying
to
see
what
you
can
find
in
interfering
with
the
passage
when
you
know
the
vessel
isn't
coming.
so,
if
it
was
within
what
we
clearly
at
that
time
--
if
the
thinking
was
developed
at
that
time
sufficiently,
so
that
it
was
like
smuggling,
i
think
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
whatsoever.
if
it
was
merely
a
device
to
try
to
get
some
control
over
other
people's
shipping
and
so
forth
and
so
considered
what
it
was,
in
fact,
it
wasn't
in
fact
--
if
it
was
so
considered
at
that
time,
i
suppose
there
would
have
been
a
protest.
i
think
that's
the
best
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
one
--
as
i
understand
the
testimony,
there
was
no
claim
to
the
contrary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
this
court
said
that
in
u.s.
against
california
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
correct
the
last
statement
i
made
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan
in
regard
to
this
proclamation
of
president
truman
in
1945.
i
was
advised
by
the
state
department
during
the
luncheon
period
that
that
was
the
first
time
that
question
had
come
up
in
1945.
there
was
never
any
protest
and
it
was
recognized
as
a
legal
right
during
the
conference
on
the
sea
of
united
nations
and
as
to
generally
recognize
by
the
nations,
but
as
to
the
question
of
when
it
started,
that's
the
first
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
question
of
what
the
boundary
was
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
provide
for
and
its
intention
and
purpose
in
this
submerged
lands
act
is
so
crucial
to
a
consideration
of
this
case
and
to
what
the
states
received
under
the
relinquishment
or
grant.
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that
first
in
a
number
of
different
situations.
first,
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
act
of
the
republic
of
texas,
its
boundary
act
of
1836
on
page
340
of
the
government's
brief.
if
you
recall,
throughout
the
argument
in
the
briefs,
great
emphasis
is
placed
upon
the
fact
that
the
texas
claim
is
based
upon
the
assertion
in
that
statute
of
what
its
boundary
is,
what
it
was
from
1836
on.
that
was
the
action
of
the
republic
of
texas.
and
i
want
to
particularly
call
your
attention
to
the
language
that
from
and
after
the
passage
of
this
act,
on
page
340,
the
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
of
this
republic
be,
and
is
hereby
declared
to
extend
to
the
following
boundaries.
that
is
not
terminology
for
any
special
kind
of
boundary,
any
special
submerged
lands
idea,
any
special
smuggling
idea,
any
special
idea
or
concept
of
boundary
that
has
been
discussed
in
the
states'
briefs
at
all.
that
is
the
description
of
a
general,
political
boundary
for
general
jurisdictional
purposes,
like
the
united
states
is
contending
congress
intended.
and
that,
in
their
own
language,
they
described
it
for
what
they
intended
to
be
to
give
them
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
for
that
republic,
and
that
is
the
fundamental
basis
of
their
claim.
any
place
you
look,
if
that
statute
was
void
and
if
they
had
never
passed
it,
i
think
you'd
find
that
their
claims
evaporate
in
thin
air.
but
they
have
described
the
kind
of
a
boundary,
and
they
proceed
to
talk
about
it
at
great
length
throughout
the
debates.
i
hope
you'll
bear
with
me
a
little
on
calling
your
particular
attention
to
language
from
the
debates,
because
i
think
in
this
argument,
it
will
be
more
clearly
understood
if
you
don't
have
to
rely
just
on
my
claim
as
to
what
--
or
the
other
side's
claims,
as
to
what
the
debates
were
about.
but
if
we
review
here
at
least
a
portion,
i
can't
cover
it
all
this
time,
of
the
statements
made
by
the
parties,
keeping
in
mind
that
these
statements
were
made
in
order
to
try
to
defeat
the
attempt
to
amend
this
act
so
as
to
reduce
it
for
all
our
purposes,
to
three
miles.
so
that
in
no
event
could
anyone
get
beyond
three
miles,
and
it
was
to
meet
up
with
that
kind
of
a
contention
that
they
represented
time
after
time
that
this
act
did
not
give
any
state,
anything
whatsoever,
and
i'll
read
the
words
of
the
people
that
they
say
where
the
draftsmen
and
senator
holland,
senator
daniel
that
represented
texas,
senator
long
that
represented
louisiana,
senator
cordon,
who
was
the
manager
of
the
bill
in
the
senate.
time
after
time
after
time,
they
said
this
bill
does
not
give
any
state
anything.
and
they
also
said
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
i
think
the
briefs
are
pretty
strong
about
that
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
if
that
is
their
position
now,
the
--
the
united
states
is
pleased
to
have
it,
because
it
simplifies
the
problem,
because
then
it
resolves
itself
to
a
question
of
whether
they
legally
did
or
legally
did
not,
at
that
particular
time,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
have
such
boundaries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
the
distinction
i
am
trying
to
make,
mr.
justice
black,
between
--
the
congress,
time
after
time,
they
said,
“we
are
not
asking
that
this
bill
shall
give
us
what
we
claim.
we
tell
you,
we
represent
to
you,
this
bill
does
not
give
us
what
we
claimed.
it
gives
us
what
we
have,
what
we
can
prove
we
have
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
nothing
more.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
they
contended
that
they
had
a
boundary.
they
had
boundaries
they
said,
and
that's
why
they
used
that
terminology.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
hope
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
the
problem
was
it
was
suggested
to
the
congress
by
the
government
that
they
had
--
there
was
no
question
of
what
they
have
the
power
to
say,
“we'll
draw
a
line,
and
we'll
give
the
states
the
rights,
we'll
give
them
a
quick
claim
to
everything
within
that
line.”
and
i
wouldn't
stand
up
here
for
a
moment
and
tell
you
they
couldn't
do
that.
they
have
that
power.
but
they
didn't
do
it.
they
didn't
want
to
do
it.
they
used
a
different
formula
for
political
reasons
and
not
improper
reasons
either.
they
thought
there
were
certain
equities
involved
if
they
had
legal
existing
state
boundaries
to
a
certain
point.
so
they
took
that
formula,
and
i
am
not
saying
that
they
were
saying
then
that
they've
set
aside
the
orders
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
submerged
land
cases
at
all.
they
weren't
--
they
said
they
were
not
doing
that,
but
they
were
making
a
grant,
and
they
chose
as
a
basis
for
that
grant
whatever
the
legal
existing
boundaries
were
that
the
states
have.
now,
there
was
no
question
in
any
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
i
say
it,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
result
is
one
thing
because
it's
like
taking
two
and
adding
two
to
it,
you'll
get
the
four.
if
you
take
--
and
i
don't
mean
this
is
that
simple.
but
if
you
take
the
legal
boundaries,
those
are
discoverable
according
to
law.
nobody
questioned
of
whether
the
states
had
boundaries
even
though
they
weren't
entitled
to
one
particle
of
oil
or
minerals
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
one
each.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
there
is.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
the
difference
that
they
claimed
that
the
test,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
the
legal
existing
boundary.
and
i
am
trying
to
demonstrate
that
regardless
of
anything
else,
the
congress
intended
and
these
particular
representatives
of
the
various
states
in
the
congress
represented
that
what
they
were
dealing
with
was
the
measure
of
illegal
existing
boundary.
now,
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
that
is
the
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
would
say
that
the
debates
preclude
them
from
any
such
contention
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
in
--
on
page
55,
mr.
cordon,
senator
cordon
who
is
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
in
the
government's
brief,
who
was
in
charged
of
the
legislation
in
the
senate
said
the
states
of
the
united
states
have
legal
boundaries.
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
power
or
duty
of
the
congress
to
make
determination
with
reference
to
those
boundaries
or
where
those
boundaries
should
lie.
it
is
a
matter
for
the
courts
to
determine
or
for
the
united
states
through
congress
and
the
legislative
organizations
of
the
several
states
to
reach
an
agreement
upon.
the
pending
bill
does
not
seek
to
invade
either
province.
it
leaves
both
exactly
where
it
finds
them.
whenever
a
question
arises
as
to
boundary,
it
will
be
determined
exactly
as
any
other
question
of
law
is
determined.
and
the
boundary
will
be
established.
the
pending
measure
does
not
seek
to
prejudge
that
issue
or
to
determine
it.
it
is
not
within
the
province
of
congress
to
change
the
present
boundaries
of
texas
without
the
consent
of
texas.
then
on
page
379,
senator
daniel,
in
government's
brief,
says
what
kind
of
boundaries
they're
talking
about.
this
proposed
legislation
would
treat
all
the
states
alike,
both
inland
and
seaward,
by
continuing
in
effect,
one
rule
of
state
ownership
applicable
to
all
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
within
state
boundaries.
now,
that
says
--
it
treats
the
inland
and
the
seaward
states
exactly
the
same.
this
is
fair
treatment
to
every
state.
the
state
of
wyoming,
is
it
possible
that
the
state
of
wyoming
with
a
landward
boundary
all
around
it
could
have
one
kind
of
a
legal
boundary
and
then
you
could
stretch
that
boundary
someway?
according
to
the
arguments
here
for
--
because
there
was
smuggling
or
because
it
was
claimed
that
you
could
explore
mineral
out
there
into
the
--
the
state
that
were
adjacent
like
colorado.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
were
giving
them
the
chance
to
prove
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
united
states
concedes
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
if
they
could
prove
to
you
by
the
criteria
set
down
in
the
statute
and
in
the
debates
of
what
the
statute
meant,
what
the
real
intent
of
congress
was
that
under
legal
principles,
they
had
a
boundary
of
three
leagues,
they
would
certainly
get
it,
and
we
would
concede
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it
is
the
problem
of
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i'm
trying
to
develop
that
it
is
a
legal
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
and
they
were
dealing
with
what
boundaries
--
legal
boundaries
are.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
at
this
point.
there
is
a
--
a
consideration
on
rearguing
our
briefs.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
didn't
find
anything
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
i
didn't
find
any
cases
where
this
court
had
ever
decided
that
the
boundary
for
the
gulf
in
particular
was
only
three
miles.
in
the
u.s.
against
california,
the
court
said
that
there
was
a
three-mile
boundary
that
the
united
states
had
recognized,
the
maritime
boundary
and
so
forth.
but
addressing
itself
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
go
farther
than
that.
i
go
as
far
as
that
is
the
truth,
and
then
i
say
that
the
legal
evidence
that
both
sides
produce,
which
--
of
which
this
court
take
judicial
notice
is
such
that
it
establishes
clearly
in
favor
of
the
united
states
that
there
was
no
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
never
was
any
legal
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
it
was
not
effective
under
the
law
to
make
them
a
boundary
projecting
beyond
three
miles.
that
is
the
position
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
in
the
first
place,
the
united
states
had
a
policy
of
three
miles
in
its
foreign
relations
as
a
maritime
boundary
that
did
not
recognize
for
any
country
in
the
world
including
texas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
claimed
that
they
had
occupied
that
area
long
enough
so
that
it
was
valid
under
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
international
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
congress
didn't
decide
whether
it
was
or
was
possible
for
them
to
prove
it.
it
left
it
for
them
to
establish
in
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes.
they
can
prove
if
they
can
in
--
during
these
arguments
that
there
was
--
that
the
three-mile
boundary
of
the
united
states
did
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
preclude
them
from
having
three
leagues.
if
that's
possible
under
the
law
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
it's
open
for
them
to
try.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
then
they
still
have
another
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
latter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
i
do
--
i
do
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can't
answer
that
yes
or
no.
i
have
to
clarify
in
this
regard.
the
--
united
states
recognizes
that
if
in
1845
in
admitting
texas
into
the
union,
they
had
said,
so
that
there
won't
be
any
argument
about
the
fact,
“texas
from
this
date
on
shall
have
three
leagues
in
the
gulf.”
the
congress
had
the
power
to
make
that
policy
regardless
of
what
the
policy
of
the
other
branch
of
executive
was.
it
did
make
it.
texas
had
three
leagues.
it's
just
that
simple.
now,
if
they
could
prove
that,
we
wouldn't
be
here,
but
that
isn't
the
fact.
now,
as
to
the
others
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
there
is
some
very
important
facts
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
regard
to
the
admission,
the
joint
resolution
to
be
considered
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
concede
all
of
that,
i
would
concede
all
of
it.
i
--
i
think
that
in
united
states
against
california,
the
court
did
say,
the
maritime
boundary
of
the
united
states
is
three
miles.
i
do
not
rely
upon
that
for
the
united
states
in
this
case.
i
call
it
to
your
attention,
but
i
do
not
think
you
examined
the
question
of
the
gulf
at
that
time.
i
don't
think
congress
felt
that
you
examined
the
question
of
the
gulf
at
that
time,
and
i
don't
think
that
concludes
you.
if
you
should
find
from
all
of
the
evidence,
and
i
do
want
to
call
attention
that
--
that
the
united
states
insist
that
one
of
the
facts
of
life
and
of
this
republic
is
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
throughout
the
years.
but
i
am
not
saying
that
secretary
can
say
black
is
white
or
that
white
is
black.
it's
--
it's
got
to
be
what
it
really
was,
but
if
the
secretary
says,
i
think
that's
a
fact
that
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
and
apply
it
in
applying
the
law.
i
don't
know
whether
i've
clarified
or
made
it
more
difficult.
what
i
am
--
i
am
trying
to
point
out,
the
fact
that
the
boundary
was
the
test,
the
question
is
whether
they
could
prove
it,
and
i
think
everything,
when
you
boil
it
down,
you're
going
to
find
in
this
litigation
that
it
all
--
there
is
one
serious
case,
and
that's
texas.
and
you'll
find
that
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states
did,
in
fact,
approve
a
three-league
boundary
in
1845.
and
if
you
will
read
the
debates,
you'll
find
that's
what
senator
holland
said,
time
after
time
was
the
test.
texas
would
have
to
prove
the
acts
that
it
did
before
which
consisted
of
this
statute
that
it
adopted
while
it
is
a
republic.
it
would
have
to
go
further
than
that.
it
would
have
to
prove
that
the
--
the
congress
of
the
united
states
approve
that.
it
said,
“and
time
after
time,
both
of
those
things
were
necessary.”
and
unless
they
did
it,
they
don't
get
three
leagues.
i
think
it's
just
that
simple
when
you
get
through.
and
i
was
trying
to
eliminate
these
ideas
about
different
kinds
of
boundaries
because
i
don't
think
they
can
be
urged
in
good
faith
in
this
court.
i
think
it
was
said
so
many
times
and
urged
in
trying
to
get
this
legislation
pass
that
what
they
were
talking
about
was
legal
boundaries,
legal
existing
boundaries
that
that
really
isn't
open
to
any
question
in
this
court
properly.
so
you
finally
get
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
--
the
congress
of
the
united
states
did
in
fact
place
the
stamp
of
approval
on
a
three-league
boundary
for
texas
in
1845.
and
the
united
states
think
the
evidence
is
very
clear,
it
never
did,
that
it
was
afraid
of
every
texas
claim
of
boundary
and
protected
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
joint
resolution
that
it
passed
deliberately,
purposefully
and
carefully
and
the
very
language
of
it.
so
that
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
didn't
fix
the
boundary
in
any
way
in
exact
terms
in
the
joint
resolution.
it
said
that
we
take
in
the
territory
of
the
republic
of
texas
which
is
properly
within
and
rightfully
belongs
to
the
republic
of
texas.
and
then
it
said,
“it
reserved
the
right
to,”
the
word
wasn't
compromise,
“adjust
the
boundary
with
any
other
country.”
now,
that
was
after
debates
of
a
long
time
in
the
congress
in
which
all
kinds
of
questions
were
raised
about
the
fact
that
texas
didn't
have
any
lawful
claim
under
international
law
to
great
areas
that
they
were
asserting
under
this
boundary
statute.
and
they
deliberately
put
that
language
in
so
that
they
could
reserve
the
right
in
dealing
with
not
only
mexico
but
all
other
countries
of
the
world
as
to
what
the
boundaries
were
properly
belong
to
them
and
rightfully
belong
to
them
under
international
law,
and
it
is
so
stated.
so
they
protected
this
very
thing
and
did
not
accept
it.
i
don't
mean
that
you
should
accept
that
all
on
my
statement.
i
am
going
to
demonstrate
that
before
this
argument
is
through
upon
texas.
but
that
is
the
point
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
page
52
of
our
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
page
52
of
the
government's
brief.
in
recalling
the
statements
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
recalling
the
statements
of
governor
daniel
that
he
just
read
in
regard
to
the
meaning
of
the
bill,
you
see
the
--
some
language
was
used
with
regard
to
this
particular
problem
of
what
this
bill
did,
whether
this
bill
itself,
without
anything
more,
gave
texas
three
leagues.
of
course,
texas
boundary
didn't
exist
at
three
leagues
at
the
time
of
the
annexation,
and
that
texas
before
the
three-league
boundaries
were
heretofore
approved
by
congress.
that
is
history.
it
was
not
written
by
this
bill
and
cannot
be
erased
by
this
bill.
the
purpose
of
this
bill
is
to
like
a
law
of
state
ownership
for
the
future.
it
didn't
have
to
put
to
all
navigable
waters.
they
used
the
term
navigable
waters
within
boundaries
that
exist
heretofore
as
the
existed
at
the
time
the
states
entered
in
union,
at
the
time
when
those
boundaries
were
heretofore
approved
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
now,
time
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice.
it
was
suggesting
during
the
argument
here
by
senator
(inaudible)
that
it
was
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
(inaudible)
ceratin
statements
with
regard
to
foreign
policy
could
have
affected
this
boundary.
the
united
states
recognized
that
if
congress
had
fixed
the
boundary
of
texas,
as
i
have
described
before
in
the
argument,
and
said
that
it
was
three
leagues
in
terms
that
--
there
couldn't
be
any
question
about
that.
the
president
had
no
power
to
change
that.
we
don't
believe
that
under
the
principles
of
law,
properly
applicable
to
boundaries
that
the
president
couldn't
make
any
such
change.
the
question
is
whether
the
congress
did
do
it
and
if
it
doesn't
--
if
congress
doesn't
speak
in
regard
to
the
maritime
boundaries
and
say
the
congress
has
spoken
way
back
in
1794
about
three
miles,
if
it
didn't,
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
state
actually
as
his
agents
can
make
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
to
affect
the
maritime
boundaries
and
he
did.
but
we
don't'
say
that
the
president
had
any
power
to
say
that
territory
of
texas
should
be
less
or
more
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
spoken
as
to
what
the
territory
of
texas
would
be
once
it's
submitted
into
the
union.
now,
there's
been
a
question
as
to
whether
we
were
properly
presenting
in
this
court
what
the
parties
have
said
in
the
debates
about
this
legislation.
it
is
terribly
important
as
to
what
was
represented
or
said
three
times
the
congress
objected
the
idea
of
it
being
limited
to
three
miles.
we
concede
that.
there
isn't
any
question
about
it.
we
don't
say
this
law
said
they
can't
have
three
leagues
if
they
can
prove
it,
not
for
a
moment,
but
that
was
the
only
issue
that
the
congress
rejected.
that
was
all
that
was
involved
in
those
amendments.
they
wanted
to
put
a
bar
--
barrier
and
say
regardless
of
what
they
construe
of
their
history
of
the
law
that's
applicable,
anything
else
that
they
can
produce,
they
can't
get
more
than
three
miles,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
that
isn't
our
position
before
this
court
at
all.
if
you're
satisfied
that
under
the
law
properly
after
we're
here,
they
do
prove
that,
if
we
were
to
come
to
the
same
(inaudible),
the
state
did
have
such
a
boundary
at
the
time
they
became,
not
before,
at
the
time
they
became
a
member
of
the
union.
the
state
can't
be
inside
and
out
the
same
time
if
--
many
things
happened
when
it
comes
into
the
union.
that's
the
language
they
chose.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
we
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
we
--
we
deny
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
say
that
they
couldn't
possibly
have
obtained
such
a
boundary
that
was
legally
enforcible
and
valid
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
against
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
i
am
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
--
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
we
wouldn't
recognize
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
because
our
legal
policy
was
one
where
--
for
instance,
let's
take
it
something
removed
from
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
did.
we
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
the
united
states
won't
recognize
for
any
other
nation
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
could
have
three
--
three
leagues
as
a
domestic
matter
in
itself,
but
nothing
that
would
be
enforceable
against
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes
and
also
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
it
would
start
a
war
in
all
the
diplomatic
exchanges
we've
had
with
many
countries
involved
and
many
countries
have
abandoned
the
claim
like
the
entrance
of
russia
and
--
and
others
that
i
have
--
italy
and
others
that
i
have
cited
and
that
are
cited
in
our
brief.
we
didn't
go
to
war
about
them
at
the
time
because
we
didn't
have
to.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
so
far
as
this
country
is
concerned,
the
law
would
be
--
it
--
it
did
not
have
a
boundary
that
was
legal.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
three
miles.
it's
a
maritime
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that's
the
position
of
this
country
in
regard
to
the
law
and
that
is
according
to
your
decision.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
in
this
--
i
don't
--
don't
think
in
the
light
of
this
particular
controversy
or
where
it
involved
is
the
application
of
the
law
of
the
united
states.
the
court
could
probably
take
what
other
countries
did
and
say
that
would
be
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
instead
of
what
was
the
foreign
policy.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
question
is,
what
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
because
it
is
a
matter
of
foreign
policy.
it
has
to
be
determined
by
the
political
branch
that
has
that
responsibility.
now,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
doesn't
necessarily
because
sometimes,
it
doesn't
come
up
--
up
as
a
direct
problem
to
our
citizens.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
quite
often
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
law
would
be
that
you
wouldn't
recognize
as
far
as
this
court
was
concerned
because
you
would
take
what
policies
of
the
political
branches
are
in
regard
to
that
matter.
and
you
would
say
regardless
of
what
finland
or
norway
or
some
other
countries
would
claim
as
being
12
or
15
miles
or
something
else,
the
foreign
policy
of
united
states
is
to
recognize
three
miles
and
our
citizens
can
go
any
place
up
to
three
miles.
and
so
when
a
case
comes
before
us,
that's
the
law
to
it
and
that's
what
you
got.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we've
done
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
might
be
but
in
this
case,
we
have
cases
that
we've
cited
to
the
court
in
which
we
have
told
the
citizens
to
go
right
ahead
and
three
miles
is
the
limit.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
if
we
are
willing
to
take
that
stronger
position,
this
court
has
said,
“we
won't
try
to
remake
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
we
will
follow
that
policy
because
we
have
neither
the
knowledge,
familiarity
with
all
the
problems
that
we
--
that
are
to
be
dealt
with.
and
so
that
part
of
the
fact,
whatever
is
said
(inaudible),
we
take
and
put
right
down,
that's
what
we
deal
with
as
the
fact
in
regard
to
that
principle
of
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
difficulty
with
that
kind
of
an
approach
to
the
problem
is
that
this
court
would
in
fact
be
the
same
that
at
the
time
that
the
state
entered
the
union,
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
will
differ
than
that
--
that
was
asserted
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
secretary
of
the
states
for
150
years.
they
have
said
that
that
is
the
foreign
policy.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
say
that
you
didn't
examine
whether
there
had
been
a
departure
as
to
the
gulf
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
that
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
no
dispute
that
from
1836
on,
texas
did
assert
by
the
statute
and
claimed
the
three
leagues
boundary
in
the
gulf.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
united
states
submits
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
some
question
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
clear
that
they
did
not
present
at
all
when
the
annexations
and
joint
resolution
was
passed.
it
was
not
discussed.
it
was
never
urged
by
any
communications.
no
--
neither
side
have
been
able
to
produce
this
(inaudible)
that
anybody
ever
urged
these
maritime
boundaries
as
being
of
any
importance
for
consideration.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
report
--
this
is
--
this
is
claimed
by
senator
wallace
that
he
read
during
the
consideration
or
the
recognition
that
the
congress
passed
the
resolution
recommended
by
the
president
(inaudible).
it
is
claimed
by
--
that
senator
wallace
did
read
the
statutes
to
the
congress
at
that
time.
united
states
says
that
has
no
effect
whatsoever.
that
when
you
recognize
a
foreign
country
which
can
only
be
done
by
the
president
anyway,
that
you
don't
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
its
territory,
as
it
claimed,
is
valid
or
has
any
meaning
whatsoever.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there's
no
question
of
what
the
boundary
claims
of
texas
in
--
to
various
--
various
extent
were
known
to
the
congress
at
the
time
it
was
annexed
or
be
admitted
into
the
union.
and
the
congress
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
being
bound
by
those
boundaries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
said
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
do.
you'll
turn
to
208
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
of
the
government's
brief.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
“the
joint
resolution
for
the
annexation
of
texas
provided,”
bottom
of
that
page
208,
“resolve
that
congress
does
consent
that
the
property
properly
included
within
and
rightfully
belonging
to
the
republic
of
texas
may
be
erected
into
a
new
state
and
we
call
the
state
of
texas.
and
be
it
further
resolved
that
the
foregoing
consent
of
congress
has
given
upon
the
following
conditions
and
with
the
following
guarantees
to
wit,
first,
that
state
to
be
formed,
subject
to
the
adjustment
by
this
government
of
all
questions
of
boundary
that
may
arise
with
other
governments.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
reduced,
and
the
mimeograph
sheet,
i
have
had
distributed
to
the
court,
shows
the
extent
of
the
great
reductions
as
compared
with
the
claims
of
texas
and
what
they
had
in
their
statute.
in
addition
to
that,
as
set
forth
in
this
brief,
some
30
pages
of
the
debates
by
the
congress
when
this
joint
resolution
was
passed
in
which
they
raised
the
question
about
all
of
the
extravagant
claims
to
boundary
and
territory
that
texas
was
making
and
that
the
united
states
must
not
be
bound
by
anything
like
that.
i
want
to
clear,
nothing
was
said
about
this
maritime
boundary
by
anybody
one
way
or
the
other
as,
just
as
many
things.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
if
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
further,
that
we
were
given
the
absolute
right,
this
government
was,
to
adjust
all
questions
of
boundary,
maritime
or
any
other.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
19
--
in
1858
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
we
said
in
so
many
words
clearly
to
britain
in
regard
of
the
guadalupe
hidalgo
treaty
that
we
asserted
no
--
nothing
in
--
beyond
the
three-mile
in
the
gulf.
that
was
the
position
we
took.
we
had
a
right
under
this
very
resolution
to
take
it.
they
bound
themselves
in
advance
to
let
us
take
it,
and
that
was
what
the
congress'
conception
was
at
the
time.
and
if
you'll
read
these
debates,
you'll
see
that
the
congress
was
very
thorough,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
now,
if
you'll
look
at
the
map,
they
were
claiming
part
of
wyoming
clear
up
near
the
north
platte
river.
they
were
claiming
a
large
chunk
of
colorado.
they
were
claiming
part
of
oklahoma.
they
were
claiming
the
whole
eastern
half
or
more
of
new
mexico.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
this
--
in
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[laughs]
in
this
statute,
mr.
justice,
they
were
claiming
all
of
these
by
the
statute.
now,
they
didn't
--
didn't
have
any
possession.
occupancy
and
they
--
the
congress
discussed
this.
they
have
said
texas
can't
give
title
to
property
that
it
doesn't
own.
there
are
rules
about
those
things
under
international
law.
they
can't
just
go
out
and
reach
out
and
name
a
lot
of
boundary
lines
and
say
that
belongs
to
us.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
comanches
owned
part
of
it.
and
they
--
they
described
the
fact,
the
comanches
are
pretty
good
fighters.
and
we'd
have
to
take
it
away
from
if
we
would
support
any
such
claims.
and
then
spain,
they
--
they
even
said
during
the
debates
that
there
was
never
a
texan
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
except
to
the
prisoners.
that's
what
they
said.
and
that
--
that
was
when
they
went
over
to
santa
fe
and
they
were
taking
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
am
just
saying
that's
what
the
congressman
said
in
presenting
this
thing.
and
there's
no
question
but
the
whole
part
of
texas
--
of
new
mexico
was
under
the
control
with
the
problems,
and
santa
fe
was
--
was
occupied
as
the
capital
of
new
mexico
and
perfectly
loyal
to
the
state
---
to
the
country
of
mexico.
and
they
just
felt,
look
at
us,
come
in
here,
and
try
to
claim
--
take
this
statute
of
texas
and
assert
against
mexico,
which
is
a
much
smaller
power
than
we
were
at
then.
we
weren't
--
we
hadn't
reached
the
size
we
are
now,
of
course,
that
we
are
still
very
much
more
powerful
and
for
us,
the
state
of
mexico,
we
are
going
to
try
to
substantiate
and
urge
even
though
there
is
no
occupancy,
no
right
of
possession,
nothing
under
international
law
that
would
give
texas
those
claims.
mexico,
“because
we
have
the
power
in
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo,
when
we
settle
with
you
this
controversy
between
this,
we're
going
to
take
the
(inaudible)
and
impose
upon
you
to
give
us
that
regardless
of
international
law.”
now,
that's
what
the
--
the
problem
that
they
had
up.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
--
we
set
that
out
in
our
briefs.
i
can't
answer
that
just
yes
or
no.
they
still
have
the
statute
in
effect
in
1836.
but
then
we
made
a
--
a
boundary
agreement
with
them
and
they
agreed
to
abide
by
our
treaty
with
spain
and
with
mexico.
and
in
that,
they
didn't
say
a
thing
about
any
treaty
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
we
agree
to
a
boundary
that
was
--
didn't
have
it
and
they
agreed
to
it.
now,
maybe,
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes,
but
they
said
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
not
included
and
that
means
it's
not
in
controversy
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
can
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
so.
in
this
way,
the
boundary
--
they
agreed
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
last
question
that
i
can't
--
i
think
the
inquiry
was
whether
or
not,
there
was
a
dispute
about
this
three-league
boundary.
and
i
think
the
correct
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
think
the
correct
answer
is
that
there
was
no
dispute
in
that
one
side
asserted
the
three
leagues
and
the
other
side
asserted
that
there
couldn't
be
a
three-league.
there
was
this
factor
that
there
was
the
convention
in
regard
to
the
boundary
that
was
set
up.
and
for
that,
they
adopted
the
--
referred
to
the
provisions
of
the
prior
agreement
with
spain,
mexico
and
so
forth.
and
then
they
agreed
that
the
convention
of
boundary
would
be
as
agreed
by
the
convention
in
establishing
a
portion
of
it
along
the
northern
side
and
so
forth.
and
in
doing
that,
the
agreement
was
beginning
--
the
boundary
beginning
at
a
mound
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river.
so
that
there
wasn't
even
at
--
as
the
government
construed,
there
wasn't
even
an
assertion
at
that
time
that
there
was
any
right
to
three
leagues.
it
was
a
recognition
that
the
boundary
itself
would
begin
at
the
shore.
now,
it
wasn't
a
dispute
that
was
raised
in
such
a
way
that
you've
just
--
that's
just
the
conclusion
you've
engulfed
in
the
circumstances,
seems
to
us.
now,
to
turn
to
the
statute
again
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
recollection
at
the
present,
what
it
was,
yes,
substantially.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
government
also
contends
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
general
terms,
i
think
it
was,
mr.
justice.
the
united
states
contends
that
texas
never
exercised
dominion
or
control
over
this
maritime
boundary.
it
claims
that
its
gunboats
did
become
active
throughout
the
entire
gulf
area.
we
contend
that
that
is
not
sufficient
under
international
law.
it
does
not
establish
any
claim
under
that
kind
of
a
construction.
united
states
would
have
had
possession
of
the
entire
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
during
the
world
war
ii.
but
there
would
have
to
be
an
assertion
of
the
right
to
keep
people
out
of
this
particular
three-league
area
to
satisfy
international
law.
and
there's
no
evidence
produced
of
that
kind
at
all.
there
is
a
claim
that
are
two
small
ships
of
the
united
states
that
were
taken
and
that
that
was
a
ground
for
claiming
that
they
had
--
they
occupied
and
had
jurisdiction
of
this
area.
one
of
them
was
taken
in
matagorda
bay
and
they
paid
an
indemnity
for
--
in
connection
with
it.
and
it
was
clearly
within
the
three-mile
area
so
it
wouldn't
be
any
proof
whatsoever.
i
think
that
was
the
durango.
the
other
one
was
(inaudible)
and
there's
no
showing
as
to
where
it
was
taken
at
all.
so
there's
no
other
evidence
of
any
kind
that
they,
in
fact,
occupied
this
area.
the
statute
however,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to,
we
believe
that
the
united
states
was
bound
to
what
was
properly
included
within
under
the
law
and
rightfully
belonged
to.
now,
if
those
terms
are
not
clear
enough
by
themselves
as
to
what
--
so
that
you'd
looked
to
any
interpretation,
it
seems
to
me,
you'd
look
the
interpretation
in
the
debates
in
which
it
was
recognized
that
the
claims
were
--
of
texas
were
very
extreme
that
they
could
not
be
maintained
and
that
all
of
these
boundaries
had
to
be
reexamined
and
texas
had
to
be
taken
in,
in
accordance
with
what
she
really
had
in
accordance
with
proper
international
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
united
states
proceeded
to
do
it.
there
was
a
--
action
by
the
united
states
of
paying
$10,000,000
to
texas
in
connection
with
claims
in
regard
to
some
of
these
territories.
the
sponsor
of
that
bill
said
that
those
were
purported
claims.
he
did
not
urge
that
they
were
valid
claims
and
there
was
much
presented
during
the
debates
about
the
fact
that
texas
was
badly
in
debt
and
needed
this
$10,000,000
to
meet
her
bond
issues
and
physical
problems
that
she
had
and
this
was
a
question
then
of
our
having
acquired
all
of
the
mexican
area
ourselves
and
the
united
states
fixing
the
boundary
between
the
two
countries
in
trying
to
set
up
the
new
mexican
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
took
all
of
that
if
you'd
refer
to
that
mimeographed
--
a
map
that
we
supplied,
you
see
they
took
off
all
of
that
eastern
half
of
new
mexico.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
went
to
new
--
it
was
established
as
a
part
of
new
mexico.
there
is
a
case
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
was
--
it
was
in
the
1850s
after
--
i
think
there
was
a
territory
established
after
the
war
with
mexico
that
was
settled
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
and
then
required
by
gadsden
purchase
right
after
that
in
1949.
and
then
the
state
was
created.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
believe,
mr.
justice
black.
it
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
--
i
haven't
--
i
misstated
myself
if
that
was
what
i
said,
(voice
overlap)
because
it
was
settled
on
the
basis
of
what
the
united
states
thought
was
rightfully
and
properly
within
texas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
placed
within
territories
of
other
states.
new
mexico
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
under
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
of
claims
held
in
the
de
baca
case
in
36
ct.
cl.,
we
cite
in
our
brief,
“that
the
title
to
all
of
the
area
that
was
set
up
in
new
mexico
was
acquired
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
from
mexico
and
was
not
acquired
by
cession
from
texas.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
long
way
around
getting
there,
i
guess.
then
there
--
this
map
showed
that
part
of
it
was
set
up
in
oklahoma
and
part
of
it
was
set
up
in
colorado.
now,
i'm
not
sure
about
my
history,
but
i
think
part
of
that
might
have
been
within
the
louisiana
purchase
and
some
of
that
area
that
texas
had
claimed.
and
some
of
it
would
be
within
the
spanish
claims
in
that
particular
area.
then
part
of
it,
if
you'll
notice
in
greer
county,
was
up
in
oklahoma
and
this
court
decided
that
texas
did
not
have
title
to
that,
in
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
agree
with
all
of
what
you
said
except
that
i
don't
say
that
the
gulf
should,
as
a
matter
of
law
and
fact,
be
treated
differently.
i'm
just
trying
to
say
that
i
don't
think
this
court
was
trying
to
examine
the
gulf
particularly
in
united
states
against
california
to
the
extent
that
it
should
feel
bound
by
the
statement
in
that
decision,
of
our
three-mile
policy,
if
the
facts
were
different
in
the
gulf
so
that
you
were
satisfied
that
we
had
actually
established,
as
a
matter
of
history,
a
boundary
that
--
for
more
than
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
change
the
interpretation
of
the
act
at
all.
i
think
you
would
still
have
to
apply
the
law
and
part
of
that
would
be
the
policy
and
part
of
it
would
be
what
happened
at
the
time
of
annexation
and
what
happened
before
that.
all
of
those
factors
to
see
whether
or
not,
texas
had
a
boundary,
a
legal
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
want
to
say
that
i
agree
that
it
wasn't
before,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
didn't
mean
at
all
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
the
policy
was
that
exactly
as
the
court
recited
it
in
u.s.
against
california.
that
it
has
been
throughout
our
history
for
150
years,
that
it's
--
it's
binding
on
the
court
and
that
it
disposes
of
the
question.
but
i
do
think
that
you
were
not
examining
between
the
parties
this
particular
question
in
the
same
way
that
as
to
what
was
intended
by
this
act
as
you
are
now.
that's
all
i
know.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
they
attached
that
to
the
hearings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
no.
either
the
united
states
doesn't
conceive
that
at
all.
it
concedes
only
that
congress
intended
that
if
as
a
matter
of
law
and
they
could
prove
it,
they
would
be
able
to
get
the
three
leagues.
but
the
fact
that
we
had
such
a
policy
which
was
called
to
their
attention,
the
case
and
its
effect
--
all
of
those
things
and
many
of
them
contended,
would
cut
it
down
so
they
could
possibly
have
more
than
three
miles.
but
they
said
don't
preclude
us.
give
us
a
chance
at
least
to
prove
our
claims
when
congress
let
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
intended
that
they
should
have
exactly
what
was
their
legal
boundaries
and
no
more.
and
if
the
law
was
such
that
three
miles
applied
as
it
was
claimed
--
it's
been
claimed
here
before
this
court
and
it's
claimed
in
all
the
debates.
but
despite
the
statements
in
u.s.
against
california,
despite
the
150
years
of
history,
it
wasn't
the
fact.
it
wasn't
the
policy
of
the
united
states.
if
they
could
actually
prove
that
there
wasn't
such
a
policy
and
that
that
wasn't
the
law
and
that
they
could
have
a
boundary
three
leagues
out
because
it
wasn't
the
law
and
because
the
law
wouldn't
deprive
them
of
it.
they
could
have
it.
and
there
--
there
were
those
who
said
in
the
debates,
“why,
it's
absurd.
you're
cut
down
by
this
three-mile,
you
can't
get
anything
beyond
that.”
and
they
said,
“all
we
want
is
a
chance.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
--
they
didn't.
they
said
very
explicitly
that
this
was
not
to
give
them
anything.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
was
to
give
them
a
chance
to
prove
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
not
--
not
that
they
claimed
it,
but
they
legally
had
it
because
they
always
said
their
constitutional
boundaries,
their
legal
existing
boundaries,
the
boundaries
that
they'd
have
for
150
years
and
senator
cordon
said,
“our
state
has
a
boundary.
it's
a
matter
of
law.
it
isn't
something
you
just
imagine.
it's
a
legal
boundary.”
and
senator
daniel
said,
“why,
this
is
to
treat
all
the
states
the
same
way.”
those
that
are
inland
as
well
as
maritime.
well,
the
inland
states
can
only
have
one
boundary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
it's
--
but
it'd
be
these
legal
boundaries
and
the
seaward
states
would
have
some
boundary,
if
they
had
asserted
one
and
it
was
within
the
national
policy
boundary
and
maritime
boundary.
with
--
if
they
asserted
that
the
coast,
which
was
the
fact,
they
would
have
that
much,
but
they
could
extend
it
three
miles
and
that
congress
approving
these
very
acts,
confirmed
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
the
best
answer
to
that
is
what
they
said
in
the
crucial
time
when
they
were
trying
to
get
it
passed.
and
mr.
douglas,
mr.
--
senator
anderson,
senator
douglas
and
senator
murray
were
very
active
in
trying
to
find
out
what
do
you
really
intend
by
this
bill?
what
are
you
trying
to
accomplish?
how
far
is
it
going
to
go?
does
it
give
it
to?
and
senator
douglas
said,
“does
a
senator
from
oregon
believe
that
if
the
proposed
language
is
adopted,
texas
will
have
paramount
rights
in
the
submerged
lands
seaward
from
low-water
mark
10.5
miles
out?”
and
senator
cordon
who
was
managing
the
bill
said,
“texas
will
have
title
out
to
its
legal,
existing
boundary
line.
not
the
one
they
had
sometime
back,
its
legal
existing
boundary
line.”
then
senator
douglas
said,
“what
is
this
boundary
line?”
senator
cordon
said,
“if
the
senator
wants
an
answer
to
that
question,
he
will
have
to
get
it
from
the
supreme
court.”
then
senator
holland,
“if
it
were
proposed
by
the
pending
measure
to
extend
the
line
beyond
the
three
geographic
miles,
the
senator
from
illinois
would
be
justified
in
having
concern.
the
real
fact
is
that
the
joint
resolution
does
not
make
any
such
proposal.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
that's
what
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
clarify
by
these
debates.
now,
assuming
that
that
is
clear
in
the
court's
mind
that
there
wasn't
anything
like
that,
then
the
next
step
[laughs]
is
whether
or
not,
the
language
itself.
now,
the
--
the
legislative
posture
was
that
the
government
in
advising
the
congress
said
--
and
i
think
there's
no
question
about
the
congress
came
to
the
same
conclusion
that
they
had
the
right
to
grant
to
the
states
out
to
any
line
that
they
would
establish.
they
could
go
beyond
--
that
if
the
congress
could
say,
“we'll
disregard
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states,”
then
by
doing
so
we'll
make
new
foreign
policy
by
this
act
if
they
seem
fit
to
do
it
and
draw
such
a
line.
that
it
was
made
a
very
difficult
political
problem
for
them,
because
then
it
would
be
said,
“well
you
just
gave
this
to
texas,
louisiana,
alabama,
mississippi,
or
florida,
when
they
didn't
have
any
legal
right
to
it
whatsoever
and
what
about
the
rest
of
the
country?
you
take
it
away
from
the
whole
country
and
make
them
a
special
grant,
a
special
favor.
but
they
said
no,
don't
--
you
don't
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
they
answered
that
and
said,
“we
don't
ask
anything
like
that.
we're
not
asking
you
to
give
us
anything.
we
want
to
go
back
to
what
our
legal,
existing
boundaries
were
when
we
became
a
part
of
the
union
--
the
state
and
union.
and
whatever
those
were,
not
who
we
claim
they
were,
they
dealt
in
expressed
terms
and
these
debates
would
claim.
and
they
say,
“we're
not
validating,
we're
not
approving
or
confirming
any
claims.
this
has
got
to
be
legal.”
if
we
can
prove
that
we
did
in
fact
have
a
legal
boundary
at
that
time,
we
should
in
good
equity
and
conscience,
have
--
according
to
that,
because
you're
giving
everybody
else
in
accordance
with
their
boundary.
that's
the
definition.
and
that
would
be
fair.
now,
those
who
were
in
the
congress
wouldn't
have
the
difficulty
trying
to
explain
that
to
their
constituents
that
they
would
with
the
grant
that
was
just
based
on
some
claims,
because
this
would
be
a
matter
of
what
they
legally
had.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
no.
they
--
they
said
that,
“this
is
not
to
be
based
on
the
fact
we
made
claims.”
they
said
that
repeatedly,
we're
not
asking
that
the
congress
approved
or
validate
anything
to
us
because
we
make
claims.
they
said,
“we're
--
what
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
long
standing,
historic
(voice
overlap)
but
you
see
what
they
said,
“historic,”
they
explained
that
in
time
after
time.
they
said
historic
boundaries
are
not
just
because
we
claim
boundaries
for
a
long
150
years.
they're
because
they're
legally
existing
boundaries
for
a
long
period
of
years.
now,
those
are
words
of
art.
they
can't
just
be
mere
claims.
and
when
it
was
raised
as
to
whether
it
would
involve
mere
claims,
they
said
it
would
not.
now
the
court,
there
is
one
particular
point
as
to
this
matter
that
would
get
them
out
of
the
problem
of
the
three-mile
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
and
that's
only
one
and
i
think
senator
holland
recognized
it
and
expressly
said
a
number
of
times,
many
times
in
the
debate.
he
was
rather
cavalier
about
the
claims
of
louisiana.
he
didn't
think
they're
much
to
them,
but
he
--
when
they
protested
he
said,
“well,
i
don't
want
to
cut
anything
down
or
interfere
with
of
course,
as
a
matter
of
courtesy,
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[laughs]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
right.
[laughter]
but
then
when
he
was
dealing
with
florida
and
texas
as
the
drafter
of
the
old
(inaudible)
he
was
rather
--
he
was
very
careful
in
saying,
what
would
we
require.
and
he's
never
at
anytime,
indicated
that
they
could
ever
get
anything
under
this
bill.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
just
--
let
me
finish,
mr.
justice.
just
because
they
had
a
claim
or
just
because
they
had
a
claim
before
they
became
part
of
the
union.
he
said
explicitly
that
texas
had
to
prove
this.
that
they
had
a
claim
to
a
three-league
boundary
before
and
at
the
time
of
--
of
1845,
when
they
entered
the
union
and
that
that
was
approved
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
both
of
those
things
were
required.
now,
we
would
have
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
they
don't
reach
the
point
where
they
ever
get
pass
the
three-mile
boundary,
unless
they
do
that.
that's
their
difficulty,
you
see.
and
they
were
recognizing
it
frankly
at
that
time.
now,
in
advising
the
court,
we
would
certainly
say
to
you
and
i
think
it's
the
law
of
every
effort
we've
made
to
find
what
the
law
was
in
this
case,
that
both
the
political
branches
have
powers
to
determine
this
question
of
what
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
is
as
to
its
maritime
boundary.
and
as
the
congress
speaks,
we
are
not
asserting
to
the
court
that
the
president
could
say
that
foreign
policy.
the
congress
says
our
foreign
policy
should
be
three
miles.congress
--
that
the
president
could
say
the
next
day
it
will
be
one
mile.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
independently.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
each
has
power
is
what
i
meant,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
if
they
conflict,
then
we're
in
trouble.
and
--
and
we
would
concede
that
if
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
the
case
i've
presented
because
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
had
said,
“texas
shall
have
as
it
comes
into
this
union,
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf,
that
would
have
changed
our
foreign
policy
at
that
time.”
and
that
would
be
sufficient
to
get
under
this
law,
we
think,
under
any
fair
interpretation
of
it,
the
debates
and
what
was
intended,
would
get
texas
a
boundary,
because
it
would
have
the
effect
of
immediately
establishing
that
there
could
be
a
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf
as
far
as
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
is
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
meant
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
think
so.
in
this
regard
i
think
that
they
--
if
they
have
said
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
appreciate
that.
but
i
think
the
distinction
here
is
that
they
didn't
say,
whatever
we
say
the
foreign
policy
today
is
shall
control
this
case.
they
said,
“whatever
the
foreign
policy
was
as
the
time
they
became
a
member
of
the
union.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
what
i
--
the
way
i
reason
it
was
that
they
were
--
would
recognize
that
under
the
law,
congress
had
the
power
to
declare
that
policy
back
at
that
time.
and
having
declared
that
texas
would
have
three
leagues
in
1845,
that
would
be
the
foreign
policy
by
operation
of
law.
and
that
this
court
would
so
find.but
if
this
court
found
that
it
did
not
so
declare
and
if
there
wasn't
any
such
approval,
then
that
would
not
be
the
law
and
the
historic
position
of
the
country
would
control.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
mean
to
be
semantic
about
it.
i
don't
want
to
be
in
a
matter
very
serious
to
all
of
these
i
know,
but
i
think
they
were
dealing
with
a
very
difficult
political
question.
and
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
the
congress
often
does
that.
and
they
didn't
want
to
face
up
to
deciding
it
one
way
or
the
other,
themselves.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[laughs]
and
so
they
--
they
said,
“you
fellows
have
claimed
around
here
for
a
long
time
that
you've
got
these
boundaries.
you
claim
they're
perfectly
legal,
they're
constitutional
and
existing.
you
say
they're
not
fictions.
and
you
say
they're
--
they
have
validity.
now
if
you
can
prove
all
that,
we'll
give
you
the
same
as
we
give
any
other
state
in
the
union
within
its
boundaries.
if
you
can't
have
it,
it's
your
own
fault.
you
made
a
lot
of
claims
you
can't
substantiate.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
because
i
think
that
what
i've
said
already
about
the
assumption
of
the
--
of
the
admission
act
being
different
than
it
was,
assuming
that
that
had
provided
it
in
terms
that
texas
shall
have
a
boundary
three
leagues
in
the
gulf,
then
that
would
have
given
them
their
rights
that
they
claim
under
the
statute.
now,
you
say
well,
congress
knew
that
wasn't
the
--
the
fact.
maybe
that's
the
next
step
that
you're
--
you're
taking.
and
then
you've
needed
the
proposition
that
they
said
well
that's
the
effect
of
what
happened.
if
you
read
all
the
representations
and
what
congress
did
in
all
that
that's
the
legal
effect
of
it,
as
though
they've
said
three
leagues
back
in
those
days.
and
congress
as
far
as
you
can
prove
that,
all
right.
if
you
can't
prove
it,
you
don't
get
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
i
can
answer
that
question
by
assuming
that
there
is
--
there
is
the
statute
that
was
--
was
not
in
fact,
that
they
could
produce
a
statute
that
we
didn't
then
know
about,
but
said
that's
texas
had
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
as
their
boundary
--
maritime
boundary,
that
would
have
given
them
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
as
a
policy
of
the
united
states
that
could
override
any
other
policy
there
was.
you
conceive
that.
and
that
would
have
given
it
through
them
at
that
time.
now,
basically
their
--
their
contention
during
the
debates
and
all
was
that
the
acts
of
the
congress
were
the
same
as
though
they
had
done
that,
back
at
that
time.
not
now.
and
if
they
could
prove
that,
then
they
would
fill
a
departure
from
the
foreign
policy
that
would
be
legally
controlled
and
we
conceive.
but
the
government's
position
is
that
they
don't
prove
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
they
did.
and
they
knew
presumably
--
they
knew
this
league's
rated
history.
and
the
reservations
that
have
been
made,
but
there
were
contentions
that
it
didn't
have
that
effect,
no
contentions
that
they
did.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
what
congress
would
have
done,
if
they'd
insisted
that
congress
decided.
but
that
wasn't
what
they
asked.
they
said,
give
us
a
chance
to
prove
it.
and
that's
a
much
easier
question
for
congress
to
answer
as
if
history
demonstrates,
than
to
go
and
have
an
answer
for
itself
and
have
these
states
unhappy
for
years
to
come.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
you
could
examine
what
the
congress
did
do
and
all
of
the
claims
that
texas
makes
in
good
faith
saying
at
that
courts
what
the
congress
did
and
that
it
was
in
effect,
a
change
in
foreign
policy.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
admission
statute
and
the
--
they
claimed
that
polk,
president
polk
made
representation
that
we
show
we're
not
--
made
--
has
made
in
private
communication
and
said
that
he's
confidential
at
the
time,
to
his
own
charge
of
the
affairs.
and
only
for
that
purpose,
they
weren't
even
communicating
in
the
convention,
but
they
claim
in
their
brief
that
they
were
used
to
--
induced
to
enter
into
this
annexation
and
they
--
that
was
part
of
their
contentions.
it
still
is.
the
facts
don't
bare
them
out,
but
duly
make
their
side
of
it.
and
there
was
the
claim
that
jackson
represented
in
connection
with
the
annexation
and
he
said,
“their
territory
was
a
part
of
their
independence.”
and
they
say
now
that
shows
jack
--
president
jackson
was
recognizing
our
claims
of
territory.
and
then
we
refer
to
this
decision
of
this
court,
in
kennett
against
chambers,
in
which
that
this
court
said
that
wasn't
any
such
claims
as
that.
jackson
was
warning
the
congress
not
to
hurry
about
this
independence.
and
as
he
was
saying
to
them,
they
don't
have
anything
to
cede
to
the
united
states
until
they
are
independent.
and
here's
the
--
the
country
of
mexico.
we
don't
want
to
be
in
the
family
that
makes
us
appearing
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
try
to
take
this
territory
away
from.
you
should
be
careful
about
approaching
them.
now,
they
have
their
construction
to
that
and
what
it
means.
and
we've
tried
to
present
what
we
think
history
shows.
and
i
don't
mean
that
they
don't
abide
that
--
that
they
don't
claim
his
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
and
what
we've
--
offered
it
to
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
if
their
materials
except
i'd
--
i
think,
if
you'd
accept
their
materials
without
the
supplement
of
what
the
history
all
--
all
showed,
i
think
you
might
think
it
gave
much
more
weight
to
their
construction
of
the
annexation
than
it's
entitled
to,
so
anything
under
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
it
seems
to
be
that
way.
but
i
think
that
we
have
developed
the
whole
story
here.
and
that
people
are
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
plus
an
additional
gloss,
mr.
justice,
that
i
think
that
should
be
put
on.
and
that
is
that
this
is
a
grant
by
the
united
states
that
under
u.s.
against
union
pacific
from
the
other
cases,
the
court's
always
held
that
grants
should
be
strictly
construed
in
favor
of
the
united
states
and
against
the
grantee.
and
then
i
think
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
wasn't
a
grant
of
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
you
have
(voice
overlap)
have
many
grants
for
the
states
but
i
--
over
the
years
in
various
forms,
you
know,
that
public
lands
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
wouldn't
know.
i
will
check
it
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
no,
i
--
i
think
they
were
trying
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
not
at
all.
i
think
they
were
trying
to
deal
although,
and
i
think
the
court
should
consider
that.
they
were
trying
to
deal
with
what
these
states
under
states'
rights
claims
had
asserted
were
their
rights
in
this
matter.
and
they
were
--
they
were
not
trying
to
just
give
them
something
out
of
hand.
there
was
no
disposition
to
do
that
as
i
see
it.
they
--
and
they
were
trying
to
treat
the
whole
48
states
in
fairness,
according
to
a
formula
that
would
apply
to
the
48.
and
the
only
way,
as
i
see
it,
that
they
could
fit
the
gulf
states
into
that
was
to
find
that
they
really
had
a
boundary
that
was
legal,
like
they
were
requiring
of
all
the
other
states
at
that
particular
time,
as
the
measure.
now,
if
they
did,
then
i
don't
see
how
the
other
states
and
their
constituencies
would
have
much
basis
for
a
complaint.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
further
gloss
in
the
statute
of
annexation.
i
think
that
it
is
so
clearly
a
reservation
in
regard
to
these
boundary
claims
and
when
you
look
back
at
the
history,
you'll
find
that
the
real
issues
of
boundary
were
in
regard
to
the
area
between
nueces
and
the
rio
grande.
that
it
was
frankly
stated
that
texas
was
claiming
wide
area
that
it
was
said
in
the
debates
they
never
had
occupied
west
of
san
--
in
san
antonio.
and
yet
they
carried
--
they
claimed
all
that
area.
and
all
to
the
north,
if
they
did
and
--
and
there
were
recognition
that
those
claims
were
just
--
had
no
validity.
then
there's
also
the
factors
and
we
developed
these
in
our
brief
at
some
length,
that
these,
that
the
texans
themselves,
after
the
annexation
treaty
failed,
went
to
mexico
and
they
were
even
willing
to
compromise
the
nueces
claim.
and
donaldson
wrote
to
the
president
says,
“my
goodness,”
or
a
word
to
that
effect,
“why
should
we
go
to
war
and
agree
to
defend
claims
that
texas
itself
is
willing
to
give
up
and
willing
to
negotiate
and
arbitrate.”
now
that's
the
nueces
and
the
rio
grande
issue,
which
was
as
pointed
to
a
filing
issue
as
texas
ever
had
here.
but
during
this
entire
time,
no
one
ever
raised
the
question
of
whether
they
could
have
a
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf.
nobody
ever
raised
the
question
of
whether
they
were
claiming
any
such
thing.
and
yet
all
the
other
boundaries
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
they
would
--
there
are
no
questions
about
--
that
there
was
a
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
question
about
whether
it
was
a
legal
claim
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
that
they
could
assert
and
whether
it
would
be
recognized
i
think,
it's
probably
a
better
way
stated.
that
was
never
asserted
or
presented
in
any
kind
of
a
communication
or
by
word
of
mouth
as
far
as
either
side
has
ever
been
able
to
show
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
the
position
of
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
there
--
there's
coloration
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
that's
the
substance.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
i
thought
that
was
inherent
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
the
questions
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
i
--
i
mean
it
to
be
our
--
part
of
our
case,
in
a
way.
now,
i
do
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
will
not.
that's
the
government's
position,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
call
your
attention
again
to
that
statute
of
admission.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
--
you
mean,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
present
congressional
policy?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
often
times
we
do.
[laughs]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
no.
no,
but
[laughs]
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
they
try
--
we
would
say
that
this
particular
statute
of
annexation
is
about
as
clear
as
anybody
could
draw
a
statute
to
say
that
you
have
to
have
--
that
it
doesn't
fix
any
boundary.
that
it's
only
the
property
properly
included
within
and
rightfully
belonging
to
texas
that's
taken
in.
and
that
even
after
a
prime
to
protect
yourself
in
all
those
particulars
as
the
united
states
did
very
carefully
because
of
its
fear
of
these
claims
of
texas,
then
united
states
said
that
it
had
a
right
to
adjust
these
boundary
by
this
government,
that's
the
united
states,
all
questions
of
boundary
that
may
arise.
now,
that
--
that
isn't
just
the
boundary
between
mexico
and
texas.
that's
all
questions
of
boundary
with
other
governments.
that
doesn't
just
say
mexico
or
one
other
government,
it
says
all
other
governments
or
with
other
governments,
which
means
--
would
mean,
all.
well,
now,
to
us
that
seems
conclusive
on
the
face
of
it.
but
you
heard
considerable
argument
doesn't
--
just
doesn't
mean
what
we
think
it
does,
that
congress
didn't
reserve
all
that,
that
congress,
by
doing
this,
actually
approved
a
three-league
boundary
for
texas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
of
course,
oh,
indefinitely.
i
think
that
the
congress
--
i
think
that
if
they
thought
there
was
any
chance
of
getting
the
congress
to
just
give
it
to
them,
they
would
have
gotten
it
to
the
congress
long
ago
and
asked
for
it
and
gotten
it.
but
they
came
up
against
the
legislative
choice
and
made
it
and
they
appraised.
it's
very
clear
in
the
debates,
they
appraised
the
--
the
legislative
prospect
of
ever
getting
a
gift
for
their
claims
not
for
their
approved
legal
rights,
up
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
what
they
said.
[laughs]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
there
--
there
is
something
to
that.
but
i
also
felt
myself
in
reading
the
debates
and
all
that
happened
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
put
up
some
kind
of
a
formula
that
would
have
applied
to
all
of
the
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
if
they
couldn't
apply
that
formula
which
would
be
the
legal
existing
boundary
to
all
the
states,
they
didn't
want
it
for
any
of
them.
they
didn't
want
to
just
single
out
any
one
of
them
and
say,
“you
get
a
special
deal
and
the
--
the
rest
of
the
47
states
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
if
there
was
only
one
state
claiming
and
was
in
there
and
said,
“we
want
a
special
deal,”
whether
it
could
get
to
congress
or
not,
that's
anybody's
gift.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
assume
the
court
hasn't
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
carefully
the
map
that
was
before
the
court
to
whom
mr.
gremillion
was
presenting
his
argument.
but
if
overnight
you
would
look
at
that
map
and
see
the
coastline
that
they're
now
claiming,
i
think
you'd
all
be
shocked.
we
were
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it's
in
your
portfolio
and
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
maybe
mr.
gremillion
could
help
me.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
gremillion
tells
me
it's
in
the
portfolio.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
they
are
taking
as
their
coastline
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
which
one?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you'll
note
upon
looking
at
that
that
what
they
are
claiming
as
the
coastline
is
extended
way
out
in
the
gulf
and
is
in
fact,
the
line
that
was
drawn
by
the
coast
guard
under
a
special
statute
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
the
coast
guard
commandant
said
in
expressed
language
that
he
was
not
drawing
it
for
any
such
purpose.
that
he
was
not
making
any
marginal
sea
boundary
of
any
state
or
for
the
united
states
that
the
only
purpose
of
it
was
to
draw
the
line
for
navigational
purposes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
you
are
not,
mr.
justice
black,
at
all.
we
--
the
government
says
you're
not.
and
i
--
i
think
it's
all
agreed.
the
problem
is
that
in
answering
some
questions,
if
you
put
the
coast
guard
line
or
--
or
the
coastline
out
that
far,
already
give
the
most
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
just
by
moving
it
around.
and
the
idea
that
you
could
have
the
coast
guard
commandant
be
able
to
draw
the
boundaries
of
the
states
or
the
gulf
from
to
time
to
time
and
change
them
back
and
forth,
i'm
sure
it
was
not
conceived
by
congress
and
wouldn't
be
approved
by
this
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
could
you
answer
justice
brennan?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
just
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
lines
they
are
using
is
the
coast
guard
line
as
what
they
call
a
coastline,
but
that
problem
is
not
before
the
court.
we're
asking
the
court
to
determine
the
question
of
three
miles
and
three
leagues
in
this
litigation.
and
of
course
the
government
does
not,
i
want
to
make
a
claim,
the
government
does
not
concede
that
the
three
miles
or
the
three
leagues
will
be
drawn
from
any
such
line
as
the
coast
guard
line.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
makes
the
claim
much
more
difficult
to
maintain
in
that
kind
of
a
contention.
we
do
not
think
it's
a
proper
construction
of
what
was
done
back
at
the
time
that
louisiana
was
created.
and
i
like
to
tell
more
about
it
tomorrow.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
try
to
stay
away
from
any
repetition
of
matters
that
we
have
covered
in
connection
with
these
cases
and
deal
with
the
problems
in
regard
to
louisiana.
i
think
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
louisiana
was
created
like
alabama
and
mississippi
out
of
territories
and
they
were
creatures
of
the
united
states
and
as
such
the
problems
in
regard
to
that
are
different
than
they
would
--
they
are
as
to
an
independent
country
like
texas
was
prior
to
that
time.
the
claim
was
made
that
the
boundary
of
texas
--
excuse
me,
of
louisiana
was
provided
for
as
beginning
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
at
the
sabine
river.
that
claim
was
made
in
their
briefs
and
also
in
argument
and
we
find
no
justification
historically
or
in
anyways
just
said
that
their
boundary
began
at
a
point
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
sabine.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
the
act
just
didn't
provide
for
that.
they
also
refer
to
the
treaty
of
1819
with
spain.
you
will
recall
that
we
have
been
over
the
fact
that
the
treaty
of
spain
of
1819
was
used
by
texas
in
connection
with
the
treaty
that
made
when
she
was
an
independent
state
as
republic
of
texas
in
the
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
texas
as
to
what
her
boundary
would
be.
it
was
used
as
a
basis
for
the
--
both
the
same
terms
were
used
in
the
treaty
with
mexico
in
regard
to
boundary.
and
on
page
185
of
the
government's
brief,
we
set
out
the
language
of
that
treaty
in
article
ii,
words
indented
defining
the
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
the
area
then
belong
to
spain
because
it
was
part
of
mexico
in
1819.
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
countries,
west
of
mississippi,
shall
begin
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
sabine
in
the
sea.
there's
nothing
about
three
leagues
at
all
continuing
north
along
the
western
bank
of
that
river.
well,
that's
just
what
the
parties
agreed
at
that
time
and
they
carried
it
down
to
the
treaties
that
i
have
just
described.
now,
below
on
that
page,
close
to
the
bottom,
is
the
exact
language
that
was
used
in
connection
with
this
survey
that
was
described
by
counsel
for
louisiana,
mr.
sachse
in
his
argument.
and
he
said,
“well,
of
course,
the
surveyor
couldn't
walk
on
the
water
and
put
some
marker
out
there.”
and
so,
he
just
didn't
say
anything
about
the
three
leagues
in
the
sea
that
they
were
to
have
when
he
was
marked
the
place
that
the
boundary
would
start.
but
under
all
practice
of
--
of
surveyor,
certainly,
it
--
he
agreed
he
couldn't
walk
on
the
sea
and
he
could
have
put
up
a
marker
of
course
but
he
wouldn't
have
to
do
that.
he
could've
said
in
the
language
of
his
minutes
like
is
often
done
by
surveyors
when
they
can't
reach
a
certain
point
that
if
so
many
feet
or
miles
or
somewhat
something
else
from
this
particular
marker
that
the
boundary
starts.
but
he
said
the
--
boundary
convention,
what
they
agreed
on
was
reestablish
the
point
of
the
beginning
of
the
boundary,
the
beginning
of
the
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
the
republic
of
texas
at
the
mouth
on
the
western
bank
of
the
junction
of
the
river
sabine
with
the
sea.
there's
nothing
about
three
leagues
if
they
ever
put
in
to
it
at
all.
and
certainly,
it
would
seem
reasonable
that
if
they
want
to
extend
to
three
leagues,
and
if
you
recall
that
the
convention
provided
that
when
they
agreed
on
this
boundary,
it
would
be
the
same
as
though
it
was
written
in
there
as
a
part
of
the
original
agreement.
but
they
said,
“that
was
where
the
boundary
began,
at
the
sea.”
now,
on
regard
to
the
same
problem
you
recall,
counsel
said
that
their
boundary
was
conceived
the
sort
of
an
extension
of
texas
boundary.
so,
they
argued
texas
boundary
was
three
leagues
validly
such
as
a
part
of
the
argument
of
louisiana.
you
recall
that
during
the
argument
of
texas
case,
they
referred
to
the
instructions
to
mr.
trist
who
negotiated
in
regard
to
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
and
said
that
he
was
instructed
to
follow
the
statute
of
texas
of
1836.
now,
that
is
on
page
102
of
the
texas
brief,
the
yellow
brief.
and
they
set
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
there
and
they've
indented
it
the
language
as
to
the
instructions
of
trist.
and
i'm
sorry
that
i
was
so
late
about
getting
this
dug
out
because
it
impressed
me
that
in
going
over
and
reading
it
again
that
that
was
an
important
consideration
if
this
man
who
was
to
negotiate
the
treaty
between
mexico
and
the
united
states
that
became
guadalupe
hidalgo
was
instructed
to
follow
this
particular
statute
and
that's
all
there
was
to
it
that
it
was
a
major
importance.
and
they
cited,
as
you
will
note,
in
the
footnote
certain
papers
of
mr.
trist
that
are
in
the
library
of
congress.
so,
i
ask
one
--
some
of
our
staff
to
dig
that
out
and
see
what
--
what
the
fact
was
in
regard
to
it.
and
now,
let's
see
what
the
fact
was,
what
the
instructions
really
were.
the
notes
there
--
and
this
is
not
in
our
briefs.
so,
if
you
care
to
examine
it
further,
you'll
have
to
make
a
--
a
note
of
it.
but
i'll
--
it's
all
revealed
here
if
you
check
back
against
the
papers
that
they
cite
in
the
notes.
i'm
sorry
that
there
is
211
pages
of
manuscript
that's
in
longhand
that
mr.
trist
filed
there
as
to
the
justifications
for
his
action.
but
he
incorporates
in
it.
and
there
is
no
question
about
it.
the
instructions
to
mr.
sidwell
as
to
what
should
be
done
in
regard
to
the
boundary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
62071.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
that's
--
that's
where
this
is
without
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
will
give
you
what's
on
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i'll
tell
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i'll
try
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
in
regard
to
this
problem.
i'll
try
to
briefly
tell
you
what
the
rest
of
the
211
consist
of
and
you
care
to
go
for
that.
i
don't
think
it
bears
on
this
particular
problem.
what
i'm
trying
to
illustrate
here
is
that
the
material
that
they
say
as
to
what
the
instructions
were
is
not
quite
accurate.
after
the
point
that
they
give
you
which
is
--
that
the
object
stands
and
said
instructions
specifically
stated
and
expressed,
it
was
the
object
of
prevailing
upon
mexico
to
agree
to
the
line
shall
be
established
along
the
boundary
defined
by
the
act
of
congress
of
texas
approved
december
19th,
1836.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
was
reading
from
their
brief,
102.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that
indented
portion
toward
the
--
on
the
bottom
of
the
page
there.
now,
to
me,
that
--
without
more,
look
like
they
were
telling
trist
and
sidwell,
“you
go
down
there
and
negotiate
according
to
this
statute.”
maybe
i
read
something
into
it
that
isn't
there,
but
that's
the
way
i
read
it
on
the
face
of
it.
then,
when
i
found
what
the
instructions
really
were,
i
find
that
after
that
comma
there,
or
they
don't
have
the
comma
after
1836,
but
there
is
a
comma,
there
is
the
word
“to
wit,
beginning
at
the
mouth,
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
rio
grande”.
excuse
me,
i
think
the
river
isn't
rio
grande."
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande;
dense
up
to
principal
stream
of
said
river
to
its
source;
dense
do
north
to
the
42nd
degree
of
north
latitude."
now,
that
is
a
definition
follow
this
boundary,
as
i
read
it,
and
you
can
each
judge
of
course
for
yourself
very
well.
as
i
read
it,
it's
the
statement
follow
the
statute
but
“to
wit”
is
a
specific
--
specifically
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
“to
wit”
is
the
text
that
i
have
read
following
says,
“you
follow
that
statute
except
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
as
i
read
it,
the
instruction
is,
“you
follow
the
statute
but
this
is
what
you
follow.”
and
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
because
there
is
no
words
of
three
leagues
about
it
at
all.
instead
it
says,
“begin
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande”.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it
comes
down
to
degree
of
north
latitude
and
quits.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
is
a
fair
construction.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
quotation
left
out
the
limitation
on
the
meaning
of
what
they
were
saying
about
the
statute.
now,
everybody
can
interpret
for
himself
what
that
language
is.
but
it's
clear
there
is
no
question
about
the
facts
that
the
instructions
incorporated
the
language
that
i
say
in
regard
to
the
“to
wit”
and
it
said
nothing
about
three
leagues
all
over
--
statute
does
say
three
leagues.
it
said,
“beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
river,”
and
then
proceeding
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
the
way
i
construct
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
i
read
it.
i
may
be
mistaken,
but
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
i
--
i
did
further
asked
that
it'd
be
examine,
the
whole
211
pages
to
see
if
there
was
any
discussion
of
any
kind
in
regard
to
three
leagues.
and
our
examination
of
the
211
pages,
all
handwritten
was
not
such
that
we
could
tell
you
every
word
of
it.
we
didn't
try
to
copy
that.
but
we
did
try
to
search
whether
there
was
a
word
of
three
leagues
in
it
and
we
found
none.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it's
pretty
strong
our
way,
but
i
may
be
wrong.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
think
that
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
someone
would
say
that
you
--
when
you
describe
or
say
“to
wit”
in
regard
to
a
boundary
that
i
thought
was
is
important
that
involve
three
leagues
in
my
statute
and
if
somebody
tried
to
leave
it
all
on
me
and
negotiations,
i
would
certainly
say,
“you
put
it
in
there.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
if
it
was
important
at
the
time
to
anybody.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
then,
i'll
give
you
another
example
where
they
left
it
out.
it
was
stated
in
the
--
in
the
texas
brief
that,
certainly,
there
must
have
been
in
the
jackson
papers
when
he
sent
this
communication
to
congress,
there's
10
different
reports.
some
one
of
those
reports
must
have
had
something
in
it
about
the
texas
statute,
and
one
of
them
did,
only
one.
and
in
that
particular
paper,
it
was
a
description
of
the
statute
by
lieutenant
colonel
--
a
colonel
of
a
corps
of
topographical
engineers
at
that
time
in
which
he
said,
“beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande”
leaving
out
any
reference
of
three
leagues
at
all.
i
don't
know
why
it
was
left
out.
if
it
was
important
and
mean
anything
that
they
were
contending
for,
why
in
the
world
would
it
be
left
out
in
these
important
considerations?
that's
the
only
observation
that
i
can
make
in
regard
to
it.
i
think,
any
man
can
make
his
own
construction
but
it
seems
to
me
if
it
was
any
kind
of
an
issue
between
these
people
that
they
are
contending
for,
that
they
wanted
for
any
purpose
and
to
maintain
that
that
was
their
maritime
boundary
as
between
the
united
states
or
the
rest
of
the
world,
or
mexico
that
they
wouldn't
have
left
it
out
in
important
communications
of
that
kind.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
was
a
communication
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
his
message
to
congress.
and
then,
in
the
texas
brief,
they
say
that
out
of
all
those
10
communications
that
were
attached
to
it,
there
is
certainly
would
be
some
reference
to
the
statute.
and
there
was
a
reference,
and
there
was
an
--
only
one
in
one
of
them.
and
in
that,
it
was
a
description
of
this
statute
by
the
corps
--
this
representative
of
the
corps
of
topographical
engineers,
and
it
referred
to
--
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
and
said
nothing
about
three
leagues
whatsoever
in
describing
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
was
delivered
to
congress
as
to
what
the
statute
was,
and
it
was
inaccurate,
it
was
incorrect
as
to
what
the
statute
contained.
but
it
did
show
that
in
bringing
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
congress,
even
the
people
like
topographical
engineers
were
specialist
in
that
field
did
not
place
any
importance
on
that
provision
and
they
didn't
even
recited
to
the
congress.
now,
it's
also
said
that
we
claimed
islands
20
leagues
into
the
sea
because
of
the
treaty
of
paris
in
our
settlement
of
the
revolutionary
war.
and
we
did
receive
a
session
of
the
islands
20
leagues
in
the
sea.
but
it's
--
no
one
has
ever
claimed
on
behalf
of
united
states
that
we
had
any
maritime
boundary
at
that
point.
we
claimed
that
those
were
islands
belonged
to
united
states
such
as
there
are
and
the
three
miles
runs
around
them,
just
like
they
would
run
around
the
sea
coast.
that's
all
has
been
in
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
it
maritime
boundary.
it's
also
said
that
as
to
the
bering
sea
that
we
receive
a
session
or
grant
from
russia
that
included
some
of
the
sea
for
large
distance.
but
that
just
isn't
born
out
by
the
history.
the
grant
itself
was
not
for
the
sea.
it
said
territory
on
the
islands
and
continent
and
marked
this
as
the
line.
it
didn't
say
any
part
of
the
sea
and
then
there
was
an
act
in
congress
where
they
tried
to
claim
part
of
the
sea,
and
the
congress
rejected
any
such
claim.
and
then
the
bering
sea
arbitration
proceedings,
it
was
adjudicated
that
the
united
states
had
never
claimed
more
than
three
miles.
and
that's
the
part
of
the
decision
of
that
arbitration
that
was
binding
upon
the
parties,
and
i
think
it
was
in
a
careful
examination
of
the
united
states
position
and
the
history
of
it
and
all
that
happened.
so,
there
just
isn't
anything
to
that
claim
either.
now,
it
also
said
that
with
regard
to
alaska,
we
claim
the
territory
out
10
miles
from
the
coast.but
that
isn't
--
that
is
incorrect
too.
the
fact
is
that
the
description
is
in
regard
to
the
10
miles
inland.
and
if
you
examine
that
description
of
the
session,
you
will
see
that
it
described
10
miles
inland
and
not
seaward
and
the
purpose
was
to
take
care
of
that
area
between
british
columbia
and
the
coast
that
we
acquire
in
that
session,
and
that
just
all
there
is
to
it.
it
works
out
mathematically,
the
language
describes
it,
there
isn't
any
basis
for
the
claim
that
we
were
making
any
kind
of
a
claim
for
10
miles
seaward
under
that
session
and
we
never
have.
now,
the
united
states
thinks
that
when
the
provision
was
made
in
the
enabling
act,
hence,
bounded
by
the
said
gulf
to
the
place
of
beginning
that
that
means
that
you
run
along
the
gulf
but
you
don't
run
out
three
leagues
in
order
to
determine
what
the
territory
of
louisiana
was
that
came
into
the
union
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
gulf
would
be,
as
to
--
it
seemed
to
me,
as
to
louisiana
would
be
the
coast.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
as
--
now,
we
don't
question.
but
including
the
--
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
mean
have
some
meaning.
we
say
that
those
islands
within
three
leagues
were
included
but
not
the
water
in
between
as
a
part
of
the
territory.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
--
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
enabling
act
for
louisiana
between
that
for
mississippi
and
alabama
in
that
they
used
the
words
"coast"
in
that
act
and
in
the
others
they
used
"shore".
and
i'm
just
trying
to
say
that
i
thought
that
in
--
in
light
of
that,
the
gulf
would
be
the
coast
for
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
those
are
two
technical
words.
i
think
i
can
describe
it
and
we
have
it
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
that
“coast”
is
where
the
sea
meets
the
land
and
the
inland
waters,
and
the
“shore”
is
the
median
low
point
where
the
water
meets
the
ground
i
mean.
maybe
that
doesn't
helping,
that's
[laughs]
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
technical
explanation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
difference
between
“coast”
and
--
and
“shore”
is
that
we
regard
on
(inaudible)
where
there
was
no
question
of
what
was
a
--
a
say
that
would
comply
with
the
requirements
that
you
can
choose
across
and
protect
against
foreign
(inaudible)
coming
into
it.
it
used
to
be
an
arbitrary
rule
of
10
miles
limit.
it
has
been
observed
by
some
international
acts.
but
there
would
be
a
coast
review
here,
and
i
think
the
shore
would
be
wherever
the
water
would
come
up
on
a
median
low
point
on
any
of
the
mainland
ground.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
concept
of
shore
and
coast
is
--
is
not
based
on
miles.
it
is
based
on
where
the
waters
come
together
and
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
would
make
a
substantial
difference
in
--
if
you
would
use
“coast”
instead
of
“shore”
because
you
do,
there,
take
into
account
inland
waters.
but
there
--
and
so,
when
there
are
inland
waters
recognized
such
you
measure
from
there
instead
of
going
back
to
where
the
land
is
and
where
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
would
go
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
the
maritime
boundary
of
the
united
states.
it's
the
policy
of
the
united
states.
it's
been
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
at
the
time,
they
didn't
place
the
three
miles.
when
they
--
it
entered
the
union,
it
was
just
at
the
coast.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
further,
the
fact
that
they
did
pass
statutes
from
which
they
went
a
127
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
no.
we
disagree
very
violently.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
i
recall
the
black
line
saying
louisiana
boundary
act
33
of
1954
is
the
boundary
they
claim
as
of
1954
which
they
claim
as
the
coast
on
which
they
would
measure
their
three
leagues.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
is
that
wrong?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
--
that's
what
they
say
at
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
our
position
is
that
it
would
three
miles
but
back
to
the
coast
which
would
go
back
to
the
islands
that
we
recognized
are
apart
and
also
along
the
shore
or
along
the
technical
coast
and
then
there
are
inland
waters
recognized
under
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
rely
upon
the
enabling
act
and
we
set
out
a
portion
of
it
on
page
172
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
172.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
recall,
mr.
justice
black,
you
said,
that
is
the
court
said
in
u.s.
against
california
that
the
court
never
had
to
consider
the
question
of
the
maritime
boundary
in
that
case.
it's
claimed
by
louisiana
that
they
did
but
the
court
specifically
said
that
and
the
government
thinks
that
it
was
not
considered.
now,
when
they
talk
about
the
deep
channel,
that
was
over
the
deep
channel
of
the
rivers
there
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
that
case
and
wasn't
the
deep
channel
out
in
the
waters
in
the
sea
or
anything
like
that
as
we
think
it's
clear
in
the
language
of
the
case.
so
that
the
recordings
did
not
in
louisiana
against
mississippi
decide
what
the
maritime
boundary
was,
it
expressly
said
it
didn't.
and
this
court
referred
to
that
language
in
u.s.
against
california.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
--
no
--
i
did
--
i
don't
be
misunderstood.
in
u.s.
against
california,
you
referred
to
the
case
of
louisiana
against
mississippi,
and
you
said
that
the
court
in
louisiana
against
mississippi
did
not
decide
what
the
maritime
boundary
was.
that's
the
reason
i
was
referring
to
that
case
because
you
expressly
referred
--
the
court
did
to
that
fact
itself
but
it
didn't
decide
that
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
or
for
the
states
in
that
case.
we
didn't
decide
the
maritime
boundary
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
coexisting?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
but
it
never
could
be
beyond
because
then
it
would
be
foreign
territory.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
with
--
with
part
of
the
state,
be
out
in
the
union
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
impart
of
the
union
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
our
own
--
our
whole
claim
is
that,
beyond
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that
belongs
to
everybody.
it's
freedom
of
the
seas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
in
that
particular
phrase.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
it
says,
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast.
but
if
they
would
want
to
just
say
anything
beyond
the
gulf,
they'd
have
to
say
10
feet
or
mile,
three
miles.
some
--
something
the
gulf
would
be
right
where
the
--
either
the
coast
or
the
shore
would
be.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
by
the
definition,
there's
a
difference
between
the
mean
low
point
where
the
water
touches
the
land
which
is
the
--
is
definition
of
shore
and
the
coast.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
understanding
of
it,
mr.
justice.
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
the
--
the
problem
is,
as
you
say
that
it
follows
as
to
the
shore
the
sinuosities
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
coastline.
and
so
that
it's
difficult
to
describe
--
except
as
you
get
down
to
the
line
itself.
and
we
have
never
contented
in
our
brief
or
otherwise
in
this
matter
that
that
wouldn't
have
to
be
examined.
but
the
question
is,
what
kind
of
a
measure
you
put
on
it?
three
miles
or
three
leagues.
and
that
when
we
--
when
the
court
decides
that
question,
then
we
will
still
have
the
problem
as
we
had
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
against
california
when
--
after
the
court's
decision,
to
determine
just
where
the
line
would
be
in
regard
to
bays
is
another
question
out
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
whatever
is
within
the
distance
of
three
leagues
from
that
point
of
measurement,
there's
no
question
of
what
the
government
would
recognize
that
they
were
entitled
to
for
three
miles.
now,
three
leagues,
as
far
as
the
--
including
all
islands.
now,
there
is
no
question
in
regard
to
that.
and
that
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
this
is
as
to
coast.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
definition
says,
including
all
islands
within
the
coast,
with
three
leagues
of
the
coast.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
with
--
we
say
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
there
are
inland
waters
as
between
a
great
many
of
these
islands
that
we
recognize
under
the
proper
rules
of
international
law,
and
they
would
they
get
that
too
under
the
description
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
there's
no
question
as
far
as
the
government
is
concern
about
that.
but
the
--
the
trouble
--
the
real
bone
of
contention
is
whether
or
not
they
get
to
measure
up
three
leagues
from
the
coast
guard
lines
as
the
way
they're
taking
it
but
even
say
they
abandoned
that
or
they
go
three
leagues
and
then
three
light
leagues
up
from
the
islands
and
that's
the
real
problem.
and
if
you'd
see
the
effect
on
--
on
the
development
and
the
exploration,
it
involved
a
tremendous
sum
of
course.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
no,
this
is
the
100,000
line.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
present
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
be
a
continental
shelf
line
all
along
the
knot.
but
it
does
--
over
on
this
side,
it
has
--
says
150,000
and
the
other
says
made
the
continental
shelf.
i
couldn't
answer
as
to
whether
it's
supposed
to
be
the
continental
shelf
all
the
way
along.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
we
--
the
government
concedes
in
the
brief
that
--
and
there's
no
question
about
it
under
the
law
in
my
opinion
that
the
united
states
can
prefer
one
state
over
another
and
it
has
in
its
history.
now,
the
equal
footing
is
a
different
problem
in
regard
to
the
state's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
constitutional.
but
that's
based
upon
when
they
entered
the
union.
and
our
--
the
united
states
has
preferred
one
state
over
the
other
in
many
different
action
so
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
united
states?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that
one.
that's
a
little
different
kind
of
a
question
whether
it
could
take
away
from
the
state
without
its
consent
something
it
already
had.
that's
covered
by
the
constitution
in
other
places.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
congress
was
pretty
certain
that
they
all
had
boundary,
legal
boundaries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
think
that's
a
little
different
question,
mr.
justice
black,
when
you
asked
me
before
in
that
i
thought
your
other
question
incorporated
extending
the
boundary.
now,
i
think
there
is
quite
a
difference
in
trying
to
shorten
the
boundary,
as
far
as
constitutional
power
is
concern.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
of
what
congress
could
say
that
a
state
could
have
a
boundary
that
it
now
has
or
that
it
could
extend
that
boundary
if
the
state
wanted
to.
but
i
don't
think
it
could
just
take
a
slice
off
of
piece
of
the
state
without
its
consent.does
that
make
clear
what
i
am
trying
to
say?
[laughs]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
then
you
have
to
go
to
legal
rules
about
the
measurement.
and
of
course,
we
have
no
difficulty
with
inland
states
or
very
little.
we've
had
a
number
of
law
suits
in
years
that
--
that
we
had
in
our
country.
but
they
have
been
worked
out.
some
of
them
may
have
been
difficult
problems
such
as,
where
the
boundary
was
on
the
ground.
and
i
think
that
you
have
the
same
problem
as
to
these,
not
in
the
case
at
the
moment,
but
in
--
it
--
regardless
of
where
do
you
fix
in
the
three
leagues
or
three
miles.
you
would
still
have
to
figure
how
you
made
it
in
order
to
get
the
maritime
boundary,
where
it
was
measured
from.
and
i
think
that
the
submerged
lands
act
was
already
provided
for
that
but
it
has
to
be
put
on
the
ground.
and
that
would
be
something
that
we
contemplate
would
have
to
have
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that's
exactly
what
was
done
in
u.s.
against
california.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
wasn't
completed
but
you
will
recall
your
viewpoint
--
mr.
davis
as
a
master
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
there's
--
some
of
that
involved
in
mr.
davis'
report.
he
came
back
to
the
court
and
said
that
he
thought
certain
rules
would
apply
to
establish
the
california
boundary
in
a
certain
way.
and
then
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
his
estimate
of
the
legal
principles
that
would
be
involved
was
--
was
the
law
that
the
court
would
accept.
and
then,
it
was
his
report
would've
fixed
the
boundary
of
california.
if
it
wasn't
and
this
court
would
have
to
accept
the
contentions
of
california
or
maybe
part
of
them
and
would
say
those
were
the
law,
and
under
that,
the
boundary
would
be
fixed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
think
that
would
then
be
a
policy
that
was
properly
within
the
realm
for
the
political
branch
of
the
congress
to
determine
and
that
it
would
be
binding
except
if
it
--
it
would
encroach
upon
constitutional
rights
of
the
state.
and
we
assume
from
--
what
you
--
that
your
question
doesn't
incorporate
anything
like
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
have
only
gone
so
far,
the
congress,
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
at
the
time
these
states
entered
the
union,
they
had
legal
boundaries
that
were
beyond
three
miles.
they
wish
them
to
have
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they're
existing.
all
through
the
debates
they
said
it
was
legal
boundary,
existing
legal
boundary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
they
were
only
willing
to
go
so
far
as
to
treat
all
the
states
the
same.
and
they
said
they
were
willing
to
give
them
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
all
over
the
country.
they
were
willing
to
give
them
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
then
in
the
gulf,
if
they
already
had
a
boundary
that
was
three
leagues,
then
that
would
be
the
measure
and
they
--
they
were
saying
that
they
we're
treating
the
same
because
they
already
have
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
think
that
the
--
the
history
shows
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
want
to
clarify
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
except
that
if
we
were
wrong
about
the
law
and
congress
did,
under
the
law,
recognize
for
texas
a
boundary
of
three
leagues,
which
we
do
not
think
is
the
law
with
other
fact.
but
if
that
had
happened,
then
we
feel
that
the
lawyers
that,
in
fact,
our
conception
of
what
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
was
changed
to
that
extent
by
that
action.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
for
that
one
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
not
beyond
the
national
boundary,
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
i
think
that
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it's
possible,
mr.
justice,
for
the
united
states
to
say,
“we
will
jug
out
three
leagues
at
one
point,
as
a
foreign
policy,
if
they
want
to
do
it.”
now,
i
think
that
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
international
law
as
we
view
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes.
but
there
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
--
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that,
mr.
justice,
because
of
this.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
well,
i
thought
we
did
too.
but
in
the
statute,
when
texas
was
admitted
into
the
union,
congress
would
have
the
power
to
recognize
a
boundary
of
three
leagues
if
it
saw
fit
to
do
so,
we
said
it
didn't.
if
it
did,
that
would
establish
as
to
texas
a
foreign
policy
of
three
leagues
for
that
particular
area.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
part
of
our
national
boundary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
of
that
date.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can
say
yes
to
that
only
if
you
add
--
if
you
add
in
the
question
or
add
to
it
proposition
that
they've
cut
down
“at
the
time”
afterwards.
if
it
stays
the
same,
certainly,
that's
part
of
our
boundary,
that's
three
leagues,
and
that's
part
of
our
national
policy.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
i
think
of
foreign
policy
would
be.
that
was
true.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[laughter]
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
think
that's
true,
and
i
think
that
all
the
recent
questions
are
hypothetical.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
mr.
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
let
me
take
my
own
statement
in
nebraska.
that's
not
a
maritime
state.
i
will
see
if
can
illustrate
it.
nebraska
has
certain
boundaries
that
i
think
we
wouldn't
have
much
trouble
of
recognizing
at
least
on
maps.
and
if
the
united
states
would
refuse
to
defend
those
boundaries
against
some
foreign
attack,
i
think
that
they
would
violate
the
constitution
of
united
states
because
it
agrees
to
defend
as
a
part
of
the
constitution.
now,
if
we
would
say
in
the
annexation
statute
admitting
texas
into
the
union
that
it
had
a
boundary
for
civil
and
political
boundary,
as
it
is
described
in
the
statutes,
of
three
leagues,
that
would
be
part
of
texas
territory.
and
that's
the
way
all
of
the
courts
have
discussed
it.
so
they
would
be
entitled
to
call
upon
the
united
states
to
defend
this
territory
as
a
part
of
--
just
like
along
rio
grande.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
of
course,
you
do
--
you
go
as
far
as
you
need
diplomatically
to
try
to
protect
you.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
i
--
what
i
was
trying
to
say
that
if
we
did
recognize
that
was
part
of
the
territory
of
texas
and
part
--
and
it
came
in
the
union
that
way,
i
don't
see
how
we
could
say
after
that,
“well,
that
--
really
it
isn't
texas,
we
won't
defend
it
anymore
than
any
other
area
of
texas.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
i
do
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
all
i
mean
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
that
much
difference
between
this,
and
i'm
thinking
about
this,
i
think
that
we
have
to
conceive
this
as
territory,
and
i
haven't
gotten
that
across.
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
explain
it
to
you,
i
believe,
because
all
of
the
courts
and
the
writers
treated
this
territory.
and
to
the
idea
that
because
it's
out
in
the
sea
that
it
is
not
territory
just
doesn't
fit
in
with
the
law,
that's
been
applied.
now,
all
i
can
do
is
try
to
stand
before
you
and
tell
you
what
the
authorities
had
been.
and
if
other
courts
have
regarded
this
as
territory,
and
this
court
has,
in
the
past,
a
maritime
boundary
as
part
of
the
territory,
then
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
take
the
legal
instance
that
proceed
from
that
and
deal
with
them
accordingly.
and
i
say
here,
that
if
texas
proves
that
it
did
in
fact,
under
all
of
the
legal
test
have
those
rights,
then
it's
entitled
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
why
--
i
have
no
difficulty
with
that.
but
i
tried
to
point
out
how
it
didn't
get
very
clear
that
in
this
situation,
and
i
said
there
were
30
pages
in
our
brief
of,
not
my
talk,
but
the
congressmen's
talk,
that
they
just
won't
accept
this
business
for
texas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it's
not
quite
accurate,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
i'd
like
to
--
to
say
that
i
think
that
my
statement
to
you
that
if
the
congress,
in
admitting
texas
into
the
union,
had
in
fact
recognized
three
leagues
that
that
would
have
created
an
exception
to
the
--
to
the
foreign
policy
that
i
thought
was
the
fact
in
our
state
department's
claim
for
150
years
as
the
fact
of
three
miles
and
no
further.
but
that
was
quite
a
difference
between
just
saying
it's
three
miles
and
just
forget
about
anything
else.
it
is,
to
me,
the
law.
and
if
you
would
find
that
in
that
admission
act,
they
had
in
fact
recognized
anything
like
that,
then
i
felt
that
they
would
be
having
their
boundary
but
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
like
that.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
all
the
way
contrary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
reason
i
do
that,
mr.
justice,
i
maybe
wrong
but
let
me
try
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
of
this
factor.
here,
the
united
states
is
talking
to
all
the
other
--
many
of
the
other
nations
of
the
world
through
its
state
department.
it's
only
the
way
it
has,
as
i
know
this
court
is
well
aware.
and
it
properly
has
a
function
of
communicating
back
and
forth
about
these
various
problems.
and
one
of
them
is
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
and
the
various
states,
where
they're
part
of
the
united
states,
on
its
maritime
boundary.
in
those
discussions,
it
has
said
time
after
time
that
our
boundary
--
maritime
boundary
is
three
miles.
now,
that,
to
me,
is
important
because
how
can
we
ever
hope
to
have
any
kind
of
a
foreign
policy
if
we
have
a
foreign
policy
for
all
the
other
countries
of
the
world
and
we
breach
it
for
ourselves.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
absolutely
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
except
for
this
factor
that
they
--
they
did
take
into
account
that
if
in
the
admission
of
texas
and
in
the
admission
of
florida
into
the
united
states,
the
congress
had
in
fact
approved
that
boundary
that
then
they
would
have
--
they
would
receive
this
benefit
under
the
statute.
that
was
what
they
discussed
was
what
they
were
doing.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
exception.
otherwise,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
you
can
find
in
the
debates
that
the
congress
as
a
whole
ever
conceived
that
boundary
would
give
any
of
these
states
in
the
gulf
anything
more
than
the
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
intent
of
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
one
of
your
problems
in
this
case,
if
you
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you're
satisfied
in
examination
of
the
authorities
and
the
debates
and
the
law
itself
that
mere
claims
are
enough,
then
you
got
claims
by
all
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
congress
said
otherwise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
did
in
the
debates
and
the
best
history
i
know
and
i've
given
to
you.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
meant
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
never
has
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you're
going
to
base
it
just
on
claims,
whether
they
are
valid,
legal
or
not,
well
then
there
are
plenty
claims
for
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
different
times
and
they're
--
but
they
are
not
legal.
they
aren't
anything
that
you
would
act
upon.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
to
my
mind,
when
louisiana
says
they
have
three
miles
--
three
leagues
out
from
the
mouth
of
river
sabine
under
the
evidence
of
the
language
that
i
have
described
to
you,
that
really
doesn't
satisfy
my
mind
that
there's
any
illegal
claim
whatsoever.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they're
talking
about
legal
boundaries,
we
think,
in
this
act.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
of
the
court
to
read
to
you
the
debates.
but
i'm
confident
you
will
review,
and
i
think
that
the
--
that
you
cannot
help
but
come
to
the
conclusion
in
those
debates
that
congress
was
never
trying
to
dispose
of
this
property
in
accordance
with
claims.
it
was
trying
to
dispose
of
it
in
accordance
with
what
the
law
was.
and
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
they
were
not
writing
it
as
to
what
the
boundaries
were
at
the
prior
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
would
take
--
if
you
assume
that,
then
how
do
you
deal
with
the
language
that
was
said
time
after
time
of
what
they
were
dealing
with,
with
the
existing
boundaries
of
the
states,
the
legal
boundaries
of
the
states,
the
boundaries
they
have
for
150
years?
they
couldn't
have
boundaries
that
just
before
that
were
one
way
and
boundaries
that
were
different
at
the
moment
after
and
still
be
150-year-old
boundaries,
how
could
they?
that's
the
kind
of
language
they
use
in
saying
what
they
meant.
and
that's
what
we've
always
used
in
this
court
as
to
what
the
congress
means.
and
time
after
time,
they
said
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
we
recognize
that
in
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
say
readmission.
we
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
say
that
we
representation
(inaudible).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
any
claim
that
would
satisfy
anybody.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
doesn't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
it
just
didn't
interpret
it
that
way
and
hasn't
been
in
anything
we've
been
able
to
find.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
got
the
islands
and
as
i
said
in
the
treaty
of
paris,
20
leagues
up
from
our
coast
in
the
session
from
britain
at
the
end
of
the
revolutionary
war.
and
we
have
always
construed
that
is
just
the
ounce
never
is
giving
us
a
maritime
build
out
that
far.
and
that's
been
treated
that
way
all
along.
the
bering
sea,
we
never
claimed
that
sea.
we
only
claimed
the
land
and
the
islands.
it's
been
the
uniform
way
of
treating
in
such
language.
now,
just
--
now,
they
--
there
is
a
further
fact
that
in
section
4,
you
know,
where
it
says
nothing
shall
prejudice,
it
deals
with
statute
or
constitution.
and
if
you
are
going
to
look
at
this
language
of
the
debates,
you'll
find
there
that
they
talked
about
the
fact
that
florida
has
to
prove
that
their
constitution,
not
all
the
other
claims
nor
any
other
involved,
just
their
constitution
was
approved
in
1868
when
they
were
admitted
to
representation
in
the
congress.
that's
what
they
have
to
prove
in
order
to
get
any
three
leagues.
that's
what
they
told
these
people
when
they
got
this
bill
passed.
and
was
--
that
texas
has
to
prove
that
she
made
the
claim
beforehand
by
her
statute,
and
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
1845
approved
it.
now,
they
told
congress
that
unless
they
proved
those
things,
they
wouldn't
get
it.
and
i
think
they
should
be
held
to
it
for
the
interest
of
the
rest
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
mean
to
do
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
whole
country,
not
just
as
to
the
gulf.
you
see
they
could
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes,
in
that
they
were
giving
them
a
chance
to
prove
three
leagues,
but
they
changed
it.if
you
see
the
court
said,
they
didn't
have
a
footnote.
and
they
said
that
the
whole
maritime
states
had
three
miles.
they
--
they
confirmed
that.
if
they
extended
their
boundaries,
they've
validated
their
getting
three
miles.
then
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
have
given
you
legal
boundaries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
said
existing
which
has
got
to
mean
legal.
how
can
a
state
have
anything
but
any
other
kind
of
a
boundary?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
wouldn't
think
so
because
of
this.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
because
of
this,
it
wasn't
maintained
for
more
than
nine
years.
that
isn't
enough
in
international
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
the
maritime
boundary
doesn't
only
affect
that
particular
nation,
it
affects
the
whole
world.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
the
--
if
the
--
if
we
move
it
from
texas
to
another
sea,
the
russia
claimed
12
miles,
the
united
states
said
it
would
recognize
only
three
miles,
did
russia
had
12
miles?
we
made
them
go
down
to
three.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
it
didn't
do
it
and
it
couldn't
against
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
part
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
the
question
of
whether
it
could
is
something
that
you
have
to
look
the
history
about
but
the
fact
that
they
didn't
is
--
is
the
history.
and
then
i've
--
we've
got
to
demonstrate
here
and
i
called
your
attention
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
say,
mr.
justice,
that
the
international
law
is
which
this
court
said
it
would
follow
that
they
not
only
have
to
claim
that
boundary,
this
maritime
boundary,
but
they
have
to
occupy
and
take
possession
and
prove
it
for
a
long
enough
period
of
time
that
it
is
recognized
in
the
international
law.
now,
you
said,
this
very
court,
in
oklahoma
against
texas,
the
24
years
was
a
very
short
time
to
be
claiming
a
particular
boundary
to
establish
it
as
a
matter
of
right.
you
didn't
pass
on
the
question.
i
don't
want
to
get
a
misunderstanding
but
you
did
comment
that
that
was
a
very
short
time.
and
the
courts
--
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
decisions
that
we've
been
able
to
find
at
all
for
such
a
short
time
even
where
they
occupied
and
--
and
held
the
area
that
it
would
satisfy
international
law.
so,
i
say
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
the
republic
of
texas
did
not
have,
by
its
statute,
a
boundary
of
three
leagues.
now,
at
the
same
time,
the
united
states
of
america
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
--
i
would
recognize,
i
think,
that
their
--
we
have
to
--
under
international
law
that
certain
places,
they
--
they
were
occupied.
and
there
wasn't
any
question
about
it.
then,
the
court
might
want
to
consider
whether
they
did
but
in
any
event,
if
it
becomes
crucial
about
the
time
1845
when
they
came
into
the
union.
but
the
--
the
nine
years
period
does
nothing
in
international
law
to
sustain
such
a
short
period
as
being
sufficient
to
establish.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
dealt
with
and
the
authorities
refer
--
refer
to
where
the
courts
have
reasoned
this
out.
they
say,
“after
all,
our
country
doesn't
look
at
all
the
statutes
of
another
nation
all
the
time
and
try
to
find
out
now
with
russia.
i
want
to
know
why
we
happen
to
make
that
protest,
and
i
examined
the
time
and
the
history
of
it
and
found
that
russia
came
to
us
and
said,
we're
having
issue
with
this
ukase.
we
want
your
ships
to
obey
it.
will
you
please
tell
your
people
to
obey
this
ukase?”
and
we
proceeded
at
once
to
protest
against
it.
but
you
--
under
international
law,
nations
are
busy,
and
they
can't
be
expected
to
know
every
kind
of
statute
that
some
country
passes.
so,
you've
got
to
bring
it
to
their
attention.
after
you
bring
it
to
their
attention,
you've
got
to
occupy
it
and
say
“now,
if
you
--
you
can't
come
in
here.”
that's
the
other
element.
and
the
only
cases
that
we've
pointed
out
to
you
are
several
law
in
one
we
can
find
that
the
--
roughly
around
50
years
and
i
think
one,
some
35
years
that
there
was
any
--
and
--
and
there
was
real
occupancy.
they
had
been
occupying
that
area.
so,
we
don't
think
that
that
claim
had
any
standing
in
international
law.
but
it
does
have
to
be
considered
as
to
what
was
intended
by
congress
when
it
was
said
that
if
they
proved
that
and
that
the
congress
approved
that
statute
at
the
time
it
entered
the
union,
then
that
was
what
they
would
mean
by
this
law
as
being
legal
boundary.
and
we
think
that
would
establish
a
legal
boundary.
and
they
said,
legal
existing
boundaries
what
they're
talking
about
and
that
was
enough
when
they
represented
that
if
they
didn't
do
that,
they
wouldn't
get
it,
i
think
that
should
be
the
terms
upon
which
it
should
be
decided.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
is
--
is
your
problem
with
regard
to
the
coast
guard
line
or
coast
and
shore?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
is
really
simplified
by
the
fact
that
we
don't
have
any
issue
about
the
islands
being
within
the
three
leagues
so
we
aren't
really
contending
about
those
islands.
you
don't
have
to
really
worry
about
it
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but
that
may
not
answer
your
legal
question
as
to
the
problem.
and
we
do
have
the
problem
in
this
regard
that
as
to
louisiana,
when
it
was
admitted
into
the
union,
the
united
states
did
refer
to
including
all
islands
within
the
three
leagues
of
the
coast.
and
when
it
admitted
louisiana
or
mississippi
and
alabama,
it
said,
all
--
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore
so
as
to
make
it
easy
for
us.
so,
we
--
i'll
try
to
discuss
it
a
little
bit
more
in
those
two
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
see
if
i
can
do
a
little
with
this
boundary
question
of
mississippi
and
also
treat
with
the
problem
of
the
gulf
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
aren't
our
maps
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
sure
i
can.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
we
take
this
description
of
the
boundary
that
appears
on
page
327
of
the
government's
brief,
boundary
of
mississippi,
it
starts
out
with,
“the
state
shall
consist
of
all
the
territories
included
within
the
following
boundaries.”
so
as
i
read
that,
that
would
be
all
the
various
kinds
of
property
to
maritime
or
land
or
otherwise
within
this
definition.
and
if
--
if
counsel
(inaudible)
turned
up
to
here
and
go
on
down
and
then
as
--
as
i
read
it,
it
comes
to
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
on
page
327.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
it
says
--
thence
west
--
westwardly
and
that
would
be
in
united
states
that
would
be
right
along
here
until
it
gets
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
black
called
(inaudible)
over
on
this
end.
now,
if
you
read
it
as
mississippi
is
suggesting
that
you
go
on
down
for
six
leagues
because
of
the
language
including
all
islands
within
the
six
leagues
of
the
shore,
there's
no
sense
to
the
proposition
of
referring
to
the
islands
at
all,
because
you've
already
--
already
got
them
there.
here
it
says
all
territories.
territory
by
definition,
as
all
of
the
experts
includes
not
only
land,
but
everything
else
within
the
area
described
so
far
as
boundaries
of
states
are
concerned.
if
you
run
on
down
here
for
six
leagues
and
then
come
over,
you
really
got
to
go
north
a
little
bit
to
get
back
to
where
mr.
justice
black
referred
to
that
(inaudible)
do
that
somehow,
to
get
over
here
and
he's
got
the
islands
all
within
it,
without
ever
referring
to.
you
don't
refer
to
any
of
that
other
states,
you
don't
refer
to
any
of
the
rivers,
inland
waters
and
so
forth,
that
are
involved
in
the
territory
when
you're
describing
it
that
way.
so
that
the
only
way
we
think
that
you
can
read
it,
is
that
you
go
westwardly
as
it
says
along
the
gulf.
and
then
to
be
sure
you
pick
up
the
islands,
you
say
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore.
you'll
notice
the
word,
“shore”
is
used
in
this
particular
enabling
act
and
it's
again
used
in
the
alabama
act
instead
of
coast
as
was
used
in
the
louisiana
act.
now,
we'll
get
down
to
what
shore
and
coast
means.
in
the
case
of
louisiana
against
mississippi,
this
court
held
that
when
congress
said
in
the
enabling
act
for
louisiana
that
it
was
coast,
but
it
meant
shore.
and
i'll
try
to
prove
that
to
you
on
the
map.
here
is
what
the
court
referred
to
as
st.
bernard
peninsula
which
we
would
call
and
which
the
court
did
refer
to
as
shore.
and
we
started
to
measure
from
that
point
in
and
instead
of
treating
it
as
coast
which
was
run
out
--
i
think
it's
a
brief
by
all
parties
here
in
the
states,
as
was
the
united
states
that
it
run
out
the
islands.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
appeared
in
the
enabling
act
of
louisiana.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
not
mississippi.
i
was
trying
to
make
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
distinction
between
the
two.
enabling
act
of
--
of
louisiana
is
on
page
224.
now,
we
think
it
would
be
very
strange
for
the
united
states
to
admit
these
states
and
as
one
keep
in
mind,
the
order
in
which
they
were
admitted,
louisiana
first
in
1812,
and
then
mississippi
as
i
recall
in
1817
and
alabama
in
1819.
and
each
one
closely
together,
but
to
admit
louisiana
first
and
give
it
only
three
leagues
and
then
give
the
other
six
leagues,
if
there
was
any
such
intention
to
do
that
kind
of
thing.
but
if
they
--
they
did
it
with
regard
to
the
islands
that
there
might
be
there,
that's
a
common
thing
for
countries
to
do,
because
you
wouldn't
want
some
other
nation
to
come
out
and
take
an
island
that
is
right
at
the
mouth
of
one
of
your
chief
water
sources,
navigational
importance,
navigational
streams
and
be
able
to
affect
your
commerce
or
be
a
threat
to
your
commerce.
so
we
think
that
the
only
basis
we
agreed
that
the
only
place
where
that
six
leagues
could
have
come
from
that
we
could
find,
was
the
treaty
in
regard
to
florida
which
is
--
which
referred
to
the
islands
within
six
leagues.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
six
leagues
in
both
mississippi
and
alabama.
they
both
claim
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
it's
described
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
both
of
the
enabling
act.
now,
in
regard
to
the
question
of
shore
and
coast,
the
shoreline
would
follow
the
various
sinuosity
every
coast.
and
there
are
thousands
of
them,
maybe
i
think,
we
all
agree
on
this
gulf
coast
along
here
and
it
would
go
on
inside
of
bays
and
all
the
other
points
all
along
right
there.
i
am
rather
loosely
pointing
to
it,
but
that's
the
way
the
shoreline
would
go.
the
coastline
would
follow
along
the
islands
that
they
recognize
as
having
inland
waters
inside
them
and
so
we
are
in
agreement,
i
think,
that
the
islands,
so
far
as
the
coasts
is
concerned,
would
be
the
point
of
measurement
under
the
act
and
we
come
down
here
and
follow
along
wherever
there
was
inland
waters.
and
then
you
measure
it
from
there,
instead
of
going
back
to
those
sinuosities.
now,
where
the
gulf
is,
when
they
described
and
use
enabling
act
that
you
come
down
to
the
gulf,
we
think,
it
could
be
wrong
that
it
means
like
you
would
say
you'd
get
--
come
down
to
pacific
ocean,
it's
where
the
sea,
the
salt
sea
comes
up
in
a
medium-low
water
against
the
coast.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
that
has
to
be
what
they're
talking
about
at
the
gulf.
now
when
they
talk
the
mouth
of
the
stream
at
the
sea,
we
think
that's
where
that
water
from
the
stream
comes
against
the
sea
and
is
the
mouth
of
that
stream
as
so
recognized.
if
anybody
was
going
to
say,
“it
should
be
three
miles
up
from
that
point”,
we
think
they'd
say
it.
now,
there
is
some
claim
that
la
salle
claimed
all
the
area
out
to
the
27th
parallel
here
for
louisiana,
when
he
came
to
that
--
that
area
and
issued
his
proclamation.
he
said
however
that
he
claimed
all
from
the
source
of
the
--
what
is
known
as
the
ohio
river
and
all
from
the
source
of
the
culvert
also
known
as
the
mississippi
river
to
the
mouth
and
then
he
said
to
the
27th
parallel.
and
he
then
went
back
a
ways
up
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
the
first
point
that
he
could
find
that
he
could
plant
his
memorial
and
he
put
it
there
claiming
it
for
france.
now,
we
think
that
it's
just
another
evidence
as
we
pointed
out
in
a
number
of
times
of
the
fact
that
la
salle
just
made
mistakes
about
longitude
and
latitude
various
times.
and
that
there
was
no
purpose
to
claim
an
area
way
out
like
some
127
miles
into
the
gulf
that
he
hadn't
explored
and
didn't
show
any
interest
in
from
the
rest
of
his
action
and
proclamation.
now,
yesterday,
i
made
the
claim
that
in
construing
a
grant
of
this
kind
that
it
should
be
strictly
construed
in
favor
of
the
united
states
and
against
the
grantee.
and
i
cited
the
united
states
against
the
union
pacific
railroad
company
and
i
was
asked
by
the
court
if,
“do
you
ever
do
that
about
the
states?
was
that
applied
to
the
states?”
i
found
one
case
in
regard
to
it
and
that's
190
u.s.,
united
states
against
michigan.
this
isn't
in
our
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
190
u.s.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
190.
379.
now,
that
applies
it
expressly
to
a
state
as
a
principle
of
law.
i
do
want
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
it's
--
it
speaks
of
it
as
public
grants
--
grants
for
public
purposes.
i
don't
see
any
distinction.
i
still
seriously
urge
upon
this
court
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
a
question
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
certain.
there
were
certain
grants
and
there
was
a
question
of
whether
they'll
continue
to
use
them
for
the
purposes
that
the
government
had
limited
them
to.
and
the
extent
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
that
kind
of
a
thing.
and
i
still
contend
that
while
this
case
might
not
--
squarely,
the
court
did
use
it
as
a
rule
of
law,
it
applied
to
states
as
well.
it
definitely
stated
it
that
way.
and
i
contend
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
where
you
are
considering
properties
of
--
of
substantial
rights
as
these
are
that
there
should
be
applied
a
rule
of
law
that
would,
in
carrying
out
the
intend
of
congress,
if
there's
any
doubt,
it
should
be
applied
to
protect
all
the
people
of
united
states
as
against
a
limited
number
involved
in
the
states.
now,
we
have
another
case
that
is
not
in
our
brief
that
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to.
i
referred
to
it
the
first
day,
but
i
didn't
give
you
the
citation.
and
that
is
the
case
of
the
anna.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
anna,
a-n-n-a.
it's
a
ship.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
it's
in
volume
5
of
robinsons
admiralty
reports
at
page
373.
now,
this
is
the
case
that
i
referred
to
and
i
think
it's
a
great
weight
here,
because
it
involves
this
very
area
that
was
decided
in
1805
by
sir
william
scott,
later
known
as
lord
stowell.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
1805.
and
this
was
right
around
--
this
was
before,
you
see,
louisiana
or
mississippi
or
alabama
and
of
course,
long
time
before
texas
and
florida
were
admitted
into
the
union.
in
the
case,
counsel
referred
to
this
statute
of
the
united
states.
and
they
say
the
three-league,
the
three-mile
claim
--
a
marine
league
is
clearly
made
by
the
united
states
by
the
statute.
in
fact
they
say
the
laws
of
the
united
states
on
this
question
are
laid
down
with
the
exact
precision
and
direct,
“that
their
district
court
should
take
cognizance
of
complaints
by
whomsoever
instituted,
in
cases
of
captures
made
within
the
waters
of
the
united
states
or
within
--
within
a
marine
league
of
the
coast
and
shore
thereof.”
then
this
involved
the
privateer
if
you
will
recall
and
it
was
a
question
of
whether
he
was
with
--
it
was
within
three
miles
of
our
shores
right
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
river
at
the
time
it
was
taken.
and
if
it
was,
then
it
would
not
--
it
would
have
to
be
released.
and
sir
william
scott
held
that
this
was
territory
of
the
united
states
when
it
was
taken
within
three
miles
that
this
ship
was
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states
and
therefore,
under
the
law,
it
had
to
be
released
because
it
was
a
property
that
was
under
the
control
and
direction
--
protection
of
the
united
states
and
its
territory.
then
the
king's
advocate
says
“this
is
a
claim
of
territory,
alleged
in
the
most
solemn
form
by
the
directions
of
the
ambassador
of
the
united
states.”
you
see
it's
the
position
that
the
ambassador
has
presented
to
the
government
and
is
being
presented
by
the
king's
advocate
by
that
direction,
the
most
solemn
form,
resident
in
this
country.
and
then
the
court
goes
on
to
deciding
the
question.
when
the
ship
was
brought
into
this
country,
a
claim
was
given
of
a
great
nature,
alleging
a
violation
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states
of
america.
this
great
leading
fact
--
fact
has
very
properly
been
made
a
matter
of
much
discussion
and
charts
have
been
made
before
the
court
to
show
the
place
of
capture,
though
with
different
representations
from
the
adverse
parties.
i
apologize
for
my
mistakes
the
times
it
got
the
essence
in
the
old
style
and
it's
a
little
difficult
too.
the
capture
was
made
it
seems,
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
mississippi.
and
as
it
is
contended
in
the
claim
within
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states,
this
is
1805,
“we
all
know
that
the
rule
of
law
in
this
subject
is
“terrae
dominium
finitur,
ubi
finitur
armorum
vis”
and
since
the
introduction
of
firearms,
that
distance
has
usually
been
recognized
to
be
about
three
miles
from
the
shore.
but
it
so
happens
in
this
case,
that
a
question
arises
as
to
what
is
to
be
deemed
the
shore.”
now
you'll
notice
that
he
says,
“we
all
know
what
the
law
is”
that
that
distance
that
you
can
control
by
your
arms
which
is
recognize
to
be
canon
shot
is
the
territory
that
the
country
has.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
recall
of
any
the
instance
left.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
seizure
claimed
that
it
was
not
within
the
three-mile
limit.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
was
geographically
found
by
the
court
to
have
been
seized
within.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
the
--
there
was
no
contention
that
the
law
was
different
or
that
the
united
states
territory
didn't
extend
for
the
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
only
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
actual
seizure
was
within
that
territorial
outside.
and
that
what
i
am
trying
to
demonstrate
is
that
back
in
1805,
the
court
of
another
country
examined
our
position
as
to
what
our
territory
was
and
found
it
to
be
that
because
of
the
representations
of
the
government
and
from
his
own
independent
examination
and
concluded
and
applied
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
but
the
--
the
issue
was
if
it
was
beyond
the
three-mile
and
that's
what
they
claimed,
just
one
--
a
foot
or
so,
they
would
have
been
outside.
that
was
what
they
were
trying
to
decide.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
decided
that
they
had
to
give
it
up,
that
it
was
found
to
be
within
the
three
miles
and
therefore
taken
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states
which
was
found
to
be
three
miles
outside
or
from
the
coast.
and
therefore,
it
couldn't
properly
be
taken
as
privateer.
that
was
the
holding.
and
the
court
didn't
find
that
they
had
three
miles
--
the
united
states
had
three
miles
and
one
foot.
they
found,
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
invalid.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
he
also
found
--
had
to,
because
if
there
had
been
no
--
if
our
boundary
or
territory
had
been
six
miles
or
three
leagues,
he
would
have
no
problem
whatsoever,
because
it
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it
was
a
ship
that
belonged
to
a
new
orleans
man.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
that
had
a
very
bad
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
when
you
examine
the
case,
you'll
find
that
the
issue
was
whether
it
was
out
three
miles
and
a
half
and
so
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
he
wouldn't
have
--
he
would
have
said
that
it's
--
if
he
thought
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
--
if
the
boundary
was
actually
three
leagues,
he
would
have
said,
well
what
other.
it's
--
the
evidence
are
all
clear.
there's
no
issue
here.
it
was
still
within
it.
but
he
had
to
find
out
whether
it
was
really
three
miles
within
three
miles
or
was
out
three
and
a
half.
and
that's
what
the
--
the
issue
boil
down
to.
and
i
think
the
case
is
very
important
for
its
recognition
of
the
claim
of
the
united
states,
a
claim
made
by
our
government
and
determination
by
a
foreign
court
right
at
the
time
that
seems
crucial
on
this
matter
in
1805.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it
deals
with
--
you
see
that
the
argument's
been
made
in
this
case.
well,
of
course,
three
miles
applies
to
other
places.
the
united
states,
the
policy
is
so
claiming
that,
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
it
--
to
the
gulf.
that's
special.
and
here's
the
case,
that
isn't
our
government
isn't
our
courts
or
anything;
it's
one
of
the
great
judges
of
admiralty
of
britain
that
examines
the
question
and
finds
right
at
the
time
before
any
of
these
states
that
we
have
that
policy
that
it
controls,
applies
it
to
a
new
--
new
orleans
ship
in
actual
life.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
i
didn't.
i
concede
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
just
like
to
say
one
word
about
the
argument
of
alabama
and
that
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
about
their
--
their
case
is
what
i
mean.[laughs]
and
i
don't,
of
course,
think
that
it's
enough
to
just
treat
them
all
alike.
i
think
that
this
court
has
the
duty
and
we'll
exercise
it
to
find
out
what
the
law
is
that
is
applicable
and
we'll
try
to
apply
it
in
--
as
it
sees
fit.
i
do
think
that
there's
a
little
more
problem
about
this
question
of
mississippi
sound
and
the
pascagoula
river
under
the
enabling
act
than
the
counsel
indicated,
because
when
he
--
we
agree
that
the
statute
did
provide
for
an
adjustment
that
the
surveyors
found
that
this
made
an
encroachment
on
the
counties.
and
it
had
such
language.
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
disregard
of
a
part
of
the
language
in
trying
to
apply
it,
that
it's
set
out
on
the
bottom
of
page
329
of
the
government's
brief.
and
then
in
--
in
ordering
it,
as
the
surveyors
were
directed
to
do,
so
ordered
as
to
run
in
a
direct
line
from
the
northwest
corner
of
washington
county
to
a
point
on
the
gulf
of
mexico.
on
that
appeal
what
his
argument
was
directed
to
just
that
far,
whether
this
mississippi
sound
or
pasacula
--
pascagoula
at
that
time
was
the
same
as
mississippi
sound,
but
it
seems
to
me
disregards
the
additional
language
that
10
miles
east
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
pascagoula.
now,
the
mouth
of
the
river
pascagoula
doesn't
come
out
to
those
islands
at
the
--
that
he
refers
to
at
the
end
of
mississippi
sound.
the
government
concedes
that
that
is
inland
waters,
the
court
so
held
in
louisiana
against
mississippi.
and
we
concede
that
the
problem
in
their
case
is
taking
that
as
the
coast
and
giving
them
three
miles
or
three
leagues.
but
as
far
as
their
enabling
act
is
concerned,
if
they're
going
to
talk
about
that
they're
really
entitled
to
six
leagues
or
something
like
and
how
you
measure
that.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
island,
this
language
deals
with
the
point
that
they
come
to
the
gulf
and
whether
they
--
whether
congress
improperly
called
it
the
gulf
of
mexico,
when
it
was
going
into
mississippi
sound,
the
inland
waters,
or
not,
they
still
did
and
you
can't
find
that's
--
that
point
as
being
outside
those
islands
if
you
also
come
to
the
question
of
the
mouth
of
the
river.
you
have
to
deal
with
it
as
a
point
inside
that
particular
gulf.
so,
we
think
that
their
claim
is
not
supported
anymore
than
any
other
as
to
the
six
leagues
that
that
language
was
used
to
be
sure
to
get
these
islands
within
the
united
states
that
we
had
a
reason
of
the
king
george
treaty
and
it
just
carried
over
and
there
could
be
no
purpose
really
in
using
that
language,
if
you're
going
to
say
it
this
goes
right
down
six
leagues
in
all
the
territories
within
it,
because
you
do
get.
now,
if
you
say
that
the
line
should
be
measured
and
come
down
to
the
gulf
and
then
eastwardly
to
the
point,
then
you
have
to
put
those
islands
in,
in
order
to
get
them
in
--
within
the
description.
and
we
think
that's
what
was
intended
by
congress.
generally,
what
that
language
is
recognized
as
and
we
think
that's
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
court
held
that
under
--
in
the
case
of
foster
against
nielson,
it
was
acquired
by
purchase.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
if
you
recall
there
was
some
--
the
position
of
the
government
was
when
it
was
acquired
by
the
purchase
and
the
court
said
it
couldn't
look
back
at
that,
it
was
a
political
decision
that
was
controlling
upon
the
court
and
that
it
must
follow.
it
couldn't
make
up
any
other
political
position.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
see
--
i
certainly
wouldn't
say,
it's
contrary
to
the
court's
decision.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
thought
this
court
held
that's
the
law
for
me.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
[laughter
attempt]
i
think
it
is.
i
think
whenever
this
court
decides,
that
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it's
conclusive.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
court
said
in
the
decision
that
if
--
it
didn't
indicate
that
it
would
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
as
i
recall
the
case,
it
said,
“whether
or
not,
it
would
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
as
the
government,
if
it
was
examining
originally.
it
wasn't
open
to
it
to
examine
originally.”
and
it
was
bound
by
the
decisions
by
the
political
branch
of
the
government.
that's
foster
against
neilson.
