mr.
richard
w.
ervin
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
florida
claims
under
the
submerged
lands
act
are
twofold,
it
claims
that
boundary
exceeding
the
three-mile
limit
at
the
time
the
state
entered,
and
a
somewhat
constitutional
boundary
approved
by
congress
prior
to
the
act
but
subsequent
to
state
(inaudible).
i
will
argue
the
first
claim,
senator
holland
will
argue
the
second.
well,
we
want
to
make
a
preliminary
statement
about
the
subject
matter
prior
to
getting
into
the
basis
of
our
claims.
the
truman
proclamation
of
1945
declared
that
“natural
resources
beneath
the
high
seas
contiguous
to
the
coast
of
the
united
states
within
the
continental
shelf
appertain
to
the
united
states
and
was
subject
to
its
control.”
this
court
in
the
subsequent
titled
land
cases,
california,
louisiana
and
texas
held
itself
bound
by
the
determinations
of
the
political
branches
of
the
government
and
international
relations
and
recognized
a
three-mile
national
boundary
which
had
been
asserted
in
the
nation's
diplomatic
correspondence.
these
decisions
gave
efficacy
to
the
truman
proclamation,
by
also
holding,
the
united
states
had
paramount
rights
in
offshore
resources
to
the
exclusion
of
the
coastal
states
that
dominion
ownership
to
the
extent
of
such
paramount
rights
followed
inferior
right
of
regulation
in
territorial
waters.
but
the
court
also
said
that
congress
could
take
further
action
regarding
the
subject
matter
and
pointed
to
the
clause
in
the
united
states
constitution
authorizing
congress
to
dispose
the
property
rights
of
the
nation
without
limitation.
the
court
also
said
in
the
california
case
that
it
could
not
go
contrary
to
an
act
of
congress
in
this
area
of
national
power.
following
the
suggestion
of
the
court,
congress
enacted
submerged
lands
act
and
outer
continental
shelf
act.
these
acts
carefully
delineated
between
dominion
and
imperium
reserving
in
the
united
states
a
navigational
servitude
in
the
high
seas,
while
dividing
the
natural
resources
of
subsoil
and
seabed
of
the
continental
shelf
between
the
states
and
the
united
states.
the
submerged
lands
act
gave
the
states
in
atlantic
and
pacific,
a
three-mile
limit
granted
offshore
resources,
but
treated
the
states
bordering
the
gulf
of
mexico
differently
because
of
historical
and
special
considerations.
each
gulf
state
was
given
the
natural
resources
beyond
the
three-mile
limit
in
the
gulf
to
a
total
extent
of
three
leagues,
if
its
constitutional
laws
prior
to
and
after
statement
contain
their
boundary
out
to
three
leagues
or
beyond,
or
that
congress
had
approved
for
a
state,
such
an
extended
boundary
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
such
extended
boundaries
are
referred
to
as
historic
boundaries.
we,
therefore,
contend
the
submerged
lands
act
meant
that
if
the
gulf
states
enabling
act
original
constitution
or
admission
act,
which
operated
to
affect
this
transition
from
a
territory
to
statehood,
either
expressly
or
impliedly
provided
for
a
three-league
or
greater
boundary,
that
entitled
it
to
the
grant
of
natural
resources
throughout
three
leagues.
texas
being
an
independent
republic
had
a
constitutional
law
prior
to
statehood
different
form
a
territory,
which
nevertheless,
contained
a
three-league
boundary
qualifying
it
to
receive
the
grant.
however,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
political
branches
of
the
government
in
asserting
policy
and
foreign
affairs
has
in
effect,
either
invalidated
or
shortly
historic
boundaries
of
states
and
navigable
waters
in
the
gulf
insofar
as
they
extended
beyond
the
three-mile
limit.
he
supports
this
decision
by
referring
to
the
tide
land
cases
of
california,
louisiana
and
texas.
we
do
not
believe
those
cases
so
held.
it
is
true
the
court
decreed
that
the
united
states
had
paramount
rights
in
all
the
natural
resources
offshore.
and
that
the
three-mile
belt
is
in
the
domain
of
the
nation
as
well
as
the
ocean
beyond
it,
but
there's
nothing
in
these
cases
directly
dealing
with
the
states'
historic
boundaries
and
navigable
waters
which
were
consented
to
by
congress
and
all
the
constitution
could
not
be
--
could
not
be
changed
without
the
state
--
the
state's
consent.
we
think
the
states'
historic
boundaries
and
navigable
waters
remain
unchanged
and
they're
operated
for
some
state
domestic
purposes,
possibly
for
the
venue
for
the
state
police
regulations
of
some
sort
and
of
course
as
a
measure
for
submerged
lands
grant.
these
boundaries
do
not
now
or
ever
have
impinged
upon
the
delegated
inferior
powers
of
the
nation
in
navigable
waters.
that
there
has
been
some
confusion
concerning
the
states'
historic
boundaries
as
they
were
laid
to
the
national
boundary
as
admitted.
the
tentative
draft
of
the
american
law
institute
in
its
reinstatement
of
foreign
relations
law
of
the
united
states
points
out
that
confusion,
but
says,
it
has
been
resolved.
it
says
that
using
historic
boundaries
for
measuring
the
grants,
the
submerged
lands
act
appeared
to
put
the
question
on
a
territorial
basis.
this
led
to
the
clarifying
decision
in
alabama
against
texas.
the
states
--
this
decision
held,
“there
was
no
limitation
on
the
part
of
congress
to
dispose
the
property
of
the
united
states
construed
in
this
manner
the
tentative
draft
says
the
act
does
not
depend
on
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea
plane
by
the
united
states
on
the
international
law.”
which
is
to
say,
we
submit
that
historic
boundaries,
as
a
measure
of
the
grant,
need
not
coincide
with
the
national
three-mile
belt.
we
think
the
historic
boundaries
are
valid
for
some
purely
domestic
state
purposes.
although,
they
may
never
have
had
any
validity
as
a
part
of
a
national
boundary,
they
still
serve
as
the
states
boundaries
for
congressional
domestic
grants.
we
think
it
is
immaterial
to
a
decision
of
this
case
while
they
have
any
validity
in
terms
of
international
policy.
as
skiriotes
against
florida,
the
court
said
that
international
law
is
not
concerned
with
domestic
rights
and
duties.
section
4
of
the
act
rules
out
the
government's
contention
that
this
three-mile
national
boundary
operate
to
shrink
the
states'
historic
boundary
at
the
moment
of
statehood
to
the
limit
of
the
national
boundary,
because
it
was
imposed
into
the
act
an
extraneous
standard
of
test,
not
within
the
context
of
the
act,
and
would
produce
inconsistent
result
with
planning
in
historic
boundary,
referring
to
a
state's
particular
constitutional
laws,
which
is
not
to
be
a
prejudiced
or
questioned.
while
this
first
claim
is
based
upon
the
act
of
congress,
of
march
the
3rd,
1845,
admitting
it
to
the
union,
and
upon
this
constitution
previously
authorized
by
congress
and
adopted
in
1838
previously,
these
documents
carried
boundary
descriptions
covering
a
chain
of
title
to
florida
territory
delineated
from
cessions
of
great
britain
to
spain
and
finally
to
the
united
states.
florida's
brief,
page
64,
a
proclamation
by
king
george
iii
of
great
britain
on
october
the
7th,
1763,
officially
and
historically
defines
the
boundaries
of
a
territory
of
east
and
west
florida.
the
keywords
in
the
proclamation
are
that
governments
--
“the
governments
of
east
and
west
florida
were
bounded
by
the
gulf
of
mexico
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
coast.”
our
contention
is
that
these
words
are
historically
implied
in
florida
statehood
constitution
by
a
direct
reference
to
antecedent
titles
and
formal
sovereign
owners.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
it
is
it
is
different
justice
black
in
this.
our
boundary
is
described
simply
by
referring
to
the
cession
between
spain
and
the
united
states
and
refers
to
the
floridas,
which
were
granted
in
the
treaty
of
amity,
settlement,
and
limits
of
1819.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
sir,
we
have
no
--
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
yes
sir.
we
used
--
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
that's
--
that
is
--
it
is
similar
contention.
yes,
sir,
on
our
first
claim.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
justice
black
--
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
that
is
our
--
that
is
not
our
description.
we
don't
tie
in,
in
so
many
words
in
that
matter.
we
simply
to
referred
to
the
ancient
--
well
we
referred
to
the
treaty
between
spain
and
the
united
states
as
our
boundary.
and
we
say
that
in
the
chain
of
title
or
the
king
george
iii's
proclamation
of
1763,
which
referred
to
the
islands
within
six
league
of
coast
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
the
part
of
the
provinces
that
were
ceded.
and
in
a
subsequent
treaty
when
great
britain
retroceded
to
spain,
it
said
all
of
the
east
and
west
florida
provinces
and
islands
depended
on
said
provinces.
that's
the
background
of
our
history,
but
we
have
no
specific
description
as
does
alabama.
now,
here
is
our
contention.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
oh
that's
--
it's
on
page
64k
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
florida's
--
yes,
sir.
it
--
we
referred
to
it
on
page
64
in
the
brief
itself.
we
don't
have
a
--
a
copy
within
the
appendix.
it
says
--
here's
what
its
--
the
enabling
act
says,
“the
state
of
florida
shall
embrace
the
territories
of
east
and
west
florida,
which
by
the
treaty
of
amity,
settlement,
and
limits,
between
the
united
states
and
spain
on
the
22nd
day
of
february,
1819
were
ceded
to
the
united
states.”
and
that
--
that
is
also
incorporated
in
the
florida
constitution
of
1838
preceding
the
act
of
admission.
we
contend
that
it
used
this
keyword
to
describe
a
perimeter
boundary
for
florida
in
the
gulf,
and
that
the
government's
argument
that
only
the
islands
themselves
and
not
adjacent
waters
were
boundaries
is
not
(inaudible).
now,
we
rest
our
contention
not
only
on
the
same
basis
that
alabama
and
mississippi
and
louisiana
have
presented,
but
also
we
think
there's
a
case
that
arose
in
new
york
upon
which
an
annotation
was
taken
and
appears
81
corpus
juris
secundum
918.
this
appears
in
alabama's
brief
on
page
4
where
a
state
line
is
described
to
run
so
as
to
include
all
the
islands
and
the
body
of
water,
such
a
description
is
not
a
direction
to
run
it
to
exclude
the
intermediate
waters.
that
is
not
the
full
quotation,
but
that's
suggestive.
this
case
--
i
mean
this
annotation
was
based
on
the
new
york
case
of
mahler
against
norwich
&
new
york
transportation
company
35
n.y.
352.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
your
honor,
that
is
not
in
our
brief.
it
is
found
in
alabama's
brief
on
page
4.
we
adopted
the
arguments
of
alabama.
and
we
are
--
we
are
taking
a
legal
position
that
this
six
leagues
from
coast
is
a
perimeter
boundary
and
it
contemplates
with
law
as
determined
in
the
new
york
case.
it
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
rule
that
all
of
the
intervening
submerged
lands,
we
will
say,
belong
to
the
coastal
state,
in
this
case,
to
florida.
now,
in
new
york,
there
was
this
description
that
started
at
(inaudible)
and
it
ran
around
long
island
and
several
other
main
islands
and
all
the
waters
in
the
bay
of
new
york.
the
solicitor
general
says
these
were
all
inland
waters,
but
if
you
read
the
case,
you
will
find
that
the
new
york
court,
and
i
think
this
is
important
to
louisiana
and
alabama
and
mississippi's
case.
the
new
york
stated
they
were
the
territorial
waters
of
new
york,
and
it
appears
to
us,
these
waters
fall
in
the
special
class
of
waters
which
chancellor
can't
refer
it
to
as
chambers
of
the
sea
followed
by
distant
headings.
if
you
take
a
map
of
this
group
of
islands
between
connecticut
and
long
island,
of
course,
being
one
of
them,
you'll
find
that
fishers
island
lies
right
off
the
state
of
connecticut,
yet
by
the
peculiar
description,
and
it
isn't
therefore
the
atlantic
ocean.
it
is
incorporated
in
this
perimeter
belt
of
islands
that
appertain
to
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
yes,
sir.
it
is
--
mr.
richard
w.
ervin
yes,
i
am
sorry,
sir.
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
government's
brief
and
it
--
but
it
is
mahler,
m-a-h-l-e-r,
versus
norwich
&
new
york
transportation
company,
35
n.y.
352.
we
--
we
cite
that
case
with
the
view
that
inland
waters
were
not
necessarily
the
basis
of
the
new
york
decision
as
the
solicitor
general
said
and
instead
that
a
description
boundary
covered
the
territorial
waters
in
that
particular
situation.
that
is
the
only
case
we
can
find
on
this
subject.
and
in
addition,
of
course,
to
what
was
said
in
the
case
of
louisiana
against
mississippi.
while
the
imperium
of
the
united
states
on
these
waters
is
unquestioned,
we
do
contend
that
the
boundary
lines
of
florida
in
the
gulf
headed
down
antiquity
and
reflected
in
florida's
pre-statehood
laws
are
confirmed
by
the
submerged
lands
act
to
the
extent
of
granting
natural
resources
out
to
three
leagues.
now,
i
want
to
show
you
about
florida's
specific
situation.
we
have
a
map
here
of
the
state
and
this
red
line
is
supposed
to
represent
three
leagues
from
coast.
we
have
the
florida
keys
archipelago
that
extends
from
the
mainland
of
florida
nearly
150
miles
off
coast.
and
we
contend
that
when
king
george
iii
proclaimed
a
six-league
boundary,
we
can
say
a
perimeter
boundary
including
all
of
our
--
actually
he
said,
including
all
the
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
coast.
we
think
he
must
have
had
some
knowledge
even
in
1763
of
these
islands
of
florida's
coast.
some
kind
of
description
of
a
blanket
in
nature
was
needed
to
cover.
anyway,
we
have
--
those,
i
am
sure
all
of
you
probably
have
been
in
the
area
and
you
know
the
thousands
of
islands
of
--
or
coral
islands
are
here
in
this
area.
for
example,
there
are
enough
island
along
here
for
the
state
to
run
a
highway
of
100
miles
to
key
west.
now,
we
have
developed
going
on
all
out
in
these
islands,
there
are
--
there
are
projected
parkways,
new
highways,
fields
of
all
the
kinds,
and
i
wish
you
would,
if
--
if
it
has
any
relation
to
this
question
that
this
day,
please
bear
in
mind
that
all
of
the
ground
--
the
gulf
coast
of
florida,
we
have
this
developed
going
on.
people
have
bought
as
far
as
a
mile
out
in
the
gulf
and
are
filling
in
at
areas
not
prior
reached,
and
it
has
to
be
made
such,
they
actually
which
have
to
be
developed
before
it
is
of
any
real
value.
but
back
in
1763,
when
this
boundary
was
proclaimed
to
cover
these
islands,
the
situation
was
this.
parks,
and
this
is
a
part
of
the
law
of
florida
and
florida
keys,
parks
operated
in
these
florida
straights
along
the
gulf
coast
and
they
needed
a
wider
boundary.
actually,
we
have
been
able
to
measure
the
new
depth
of
this
water
along
here
--
here
at
many
places,
it's
not
over
three
or
four
feet
deep.
and
along
in
here
for
example,
throughout
the
whole
area,
it
isn't
more
than
four
thousand
on
the
average.
and
we
think
that
it
would
certainly
(inaudible),
if
--
if
we're
now
decreed,
that
everybody
had
to
go
and
deal
with
the
federal
government
so
far
as
landfill
development
is
concerned
within
its
other
(inaudible).
now,
these
clusters
of
islands
all
around
the
coast
presented
special
problem
and
there
was
a
real
reason
for
a
six-league
perimeter
boundary
and
a
different,
we
think,
consideration
for
florida
in
that
relation.
remember
please,
if
you
will,
that
the
professor
sone
(ph)
who
has
briefed
this
matter
for
the
gulf
coastal
states,
tells
us
that
coastal
states
with
--
with
very
shallow
shoal
area
needed
a
wider
gird
in
order
to
protect
coastal
ship.
now,
i
am
--
i
am
closing.
i
want
to
say
only
this
that
it
is
a
principle
of
law,
it
was
stated
many
years
ago,
well,
in
1909
by
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
in
the
grisbådarna
case,
where
it
said,
it
is
a
settled
principle
of
law
of
nation
that
a
state
of
things
which
actually
exists
and
it
existed
for
a
long
time
should
be
changed
as
little
as
possible.
this
condition
has
existed
of
our
florida
coast.
we
thought
we
had
the
right
to
develop
and
then
use
it
of
all
these
years
and
we
do
believe
that
it
does
present
a
special
situation.
for
that
reason,
florida
case,
we
think
justifies
a
perimeter
boundary
as
a
part
of
the
original
admission
of
--
of
the
state
into
the
union.
i
have
made
a
mistake
of
referring
to
page
4
from
the
alabama
brief.
i'd
like
to
correct
it,
it's
page
10.
