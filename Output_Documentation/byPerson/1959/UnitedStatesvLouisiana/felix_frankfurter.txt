justice
felix
frankfurter
or
by
reason
of
--
by
reason
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
reference
made
in
the
hawaiian
situation
to
the
controversy
that
had
arisen
under
this
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
as
i
understand
you
to
argue
this
matter
of
the
meaning
called
of
the
last
sentence
in
effect,
is
four
leagues,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
merely
stating
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
i
understand
your
position,
but
please
don't
argue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
good.
to
clarify
a
little
bit,
as
i
understand
--
is
this
correct
that
you
say
that
although
section
4
in
its
entirety
deals
with
the
subject
of
seaward
boundary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
last
shore
deals
specifically
with
seaward
boundaries.
it
does
not
relate
to
seaward
boundaries
in
relation
to
the
grant
that
this
statute
gave.
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
sentence
doesn't
say
so,
but
it
says
the
structure
of
the
--
of
the
--
an
act
and
its
relationship
to
section
2
and
grant
due
cause,
you
argued
it
seems
to
that
reduction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
sentence
has
been
left
out.
would
there
be
any
legal
difference
from
your
point
of
view?
we
call
it
the
statute
deals
with
the
grants
presumably
it
doesn't
deal
with
things
unrelated
to
grants,
so
that
the
sentence
in
your
point
of
view
is
a
needles
sentence,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
didn't
think
section
2
just
take
anything
away
it
gave.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they
didn't
have
to
put
that
here
in
order
to
make
sure
that
they
didn't
take
anything
away
in
relation
to
your
subject
matter
not
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
contemplated
that
it
might.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
fair
to
say
however,
that
the
thought
that
there
might
be
the
establishable
claim
beyond
three
miles
was
not
to
a
practical
as
to
leave
them
(inaudible)
of
all
these
attachments
of
transitory
possibilities,
is
that
necessary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
dealing
with
reality
and
that's
--
but
there
might
be
such
a
claim
taking
what
are
being
established
for
the
real
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
that
somebody
asserted
who
will
shut
him
up
by
putting
a
(inaudible)
wasn't
it
as
vague
as
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
--
what
you
imply
or
do
you
imply
or
what
you
call
a
legal
question
namely
--
including
therein,
of
the
national
boundaries
of
the
united
states,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
national
boundary
of
the
united
states
is
partly
--
is
that
our
only
legal
question?
is
that
a
national
policy
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
a
legal
question
like
other
questions
that
this
court
passes
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
involves
--
it
really
was
sometimes
when
he's
about
to
call
a
political
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
really
asked
to
pass
upon
a
political
question
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
order
to
sustain
your
position,
a
political
issue
is
implicated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
--
we
do
accept
in
certain
categories
of
cases,
what
the
political
authority
tell
us
in
the
political
determination
for
some
other
legal
questions.
so
it
seems
to
me,
here,
the
question
always
turns
out
what
the
government's
claim
is
the
political
position
of
the
united
states
namely,
the
national
boundaries
of
the
united
states
concede
of
not
as
ordinary
boundaries
to
concede
of,
but
the
pronouncement
of
all
sorts
of
secretaries
of
state,
that
the
usual
sobriety
about
this
pronouncement
on
the
acceptance
or
non-acceptance
of
a
qualification
of
such
political
pronouncements.
is
that
(inaudible)
various
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
cast,
and
he's
not
about
them,
i
simply
say
that
secretaries
of
states
oftentimes
the
time
advocate
to
their
country.
that's
all
i've
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
was
that
before
or
after
our
representative
to
geneva
was
ready
to
accept
six
miles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there
seems
to
be
a
very
--
(inaudible)
you're
going
to
go
into
this
thing
it
makes
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
there
are
other
elements
of
over
simplification
(inaudible)
put
to
use
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely
--
well,
they
included
in
boundaries
is
impliedly
that
which
of
necessity
in
view
of
the
policy
of
the
united
states,
the
united
states
limited
the
boundary
essentially
to
what
was
the
national
boundary.
and
that
the
national
boundary
must
be
--
that
the
state
boundary
must
coextensive
with
the
national
boundary.
that's
your
basic
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
requires
inspection
though.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
throughout
the
world,
they've
got
a
federal
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
may
not,
but
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
could
--
i
could
agree
with
everything
you've
said
as
to
the
importance
of
the
rights
of
american
citizens
regarding
the
extent
of
innocent
passage
and
--
and
kindred
rights.
the
(inaudible)
what
was
that
case,
12
years
ago
(inaudible)
way
beyond
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
skiriotes.
but
before
i
--
before
it
controls
the
question
for
me
in
this
case,
i
would
have
to
be
convinced
that
the
phrase,
“boundaries
of
the
respective
states
equals
national
boundaries
during
the
years
in
question.”
i
would
have
to
be
convinced
that
all
these
problems
of
foreign
relations
have
any
relevance
as
to
whether
the
states
of
the
united
states
should
be
allowed
to
exploit
something
as
to
which
there
is
no
ownership
in
the
united
states
or
in
anybody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
may
be
--
everything
you
say
may
be
respected
and
enforceable
by
the
united
states,
if
foreign
relations
and
yet
not
determined
whether
congress
--
i
suppose
you
admit
congress
could've
given
the
states
the
right
of
exploiting
this
oil,
which
it
itself
has
asserted,
which
this
court
has
recognized.
so
how
does
that
internal
question,
how
is
that
internal
question
to
be
resolved
by
worrying
about
all
these
foreign
relations
which
nobody
denies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
to
the
final
problems
--
what
this
government
has
or
has
not
maintained
regarding
the
outer
boundary
limits
of
a
nation,
certainly
in
our
prior
decisions
in
the
california
and
texas
cases,
we've
given
the
federal
government
with
this
power,
therefore,
necessarily,
from
my
point
of
view,
alabama
against
texas
follows.
indeed,
we'll
see
to
that
in
the
original
california
or
the
texas
case,
california
case.
so
that
what
you
say
that
the
question
is
simply
whether
or
not,
you
say
if
i
understand
you
that
the
boundaries
of
the
states
the
phrase,
“boundaries
of
the
states,”
merely
results
for
this
court
the
question,
what
were
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states?
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
if
this
--
but
if
congress
could
give
exploring
and
exploiting
powers
to
the
states
which
it
itself
enjoys,
i
do
not
see
how
the
argument
to
that
you
--
that
there
is
raised
--
there
are
raised
all
these
questions
of
relationships
between
american
citizens
in
other
countries
or
the
threat
of
other
countries
is
appearing,
well,
that's
come
into
play.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
because
you
have
agreed
that
congress
thought
it
was
a
substantial
question
--
at
least
not
a
frivolous
or
fantastic
question
which
it
wrote
into
the
statute
that
perhaps
some
states
can
establish,
that
they
have
boundaries
in
the
sea
themselves,
in
this
country,
not
other
countries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
beyond
three
miles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
congress
found
it.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
that's
why
we're
here.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
consequences
of
being
able
to
find
it
can't
so
unthinkable
and
so
horrendous
that
your
argument
has
made
it
out
because
of
the
consequences
that
you
picture.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
i
may
reach
your
conclusion
and
i
can
assure
you
that
my
mind
is
as
clear
as
this
at
the
moment
under
the
subject
of
this
statute.
just
as
clear
in
this
statute,
if
i
can
say
so.
[laughs]
but
i
wouldn't
reach
it
because
i
would
see
horrendous,
dangerous
consequences
in
our
international
relations.
i
would
religiously
cross
on
the
basis
of
relevant
considerations
of
statutory
construction,
congress'
has
so
defined
boundaries
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
because
i
think
terrible
consequences
would
follow
or
a
whole
cause
of
international
relationship
would
be
embarrassed
in
--
to
make
me
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say
--
may
i
say,
mr.
solicitor
that
a
little
earlier,
you
put
your
case
in
great
brevity.
namely,
buy
you're
now
arguing
--
namely
that
boundary
in
this
statute,
by
virtue
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
statute
and
by
virtue
of
the
legislative
history
to
which
you
have
coming,
boundaries,
is
a
term
of
art
defined
by
the
position
taken
by
the
political
branch
of
the
government
as
meaning
the
boundaries
of
the
national
government.
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
view
it
in
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
calling
about
less
in
this
case,
are
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
many
oil.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
hart.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
you
to
say
that
--
you
construe,
“became
a
member
of
the
union.”
you
say
becoming
and
at
the
time,
such
state
is
a
member
of
the
union.
that
becoming
a
member,
that
phrase,
“at
the
time
became
a
member
of
the
union”
is
not
a
specific
moment
in
time,
but
is
a
process,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
a
process
has
a
beginning
and
an
end.
when
do
the
process
--
when
do
the
process
of
admission
of
texas
in
your
view
begin
precisely?
and
what
is
determinant
element?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
is
determination
is
there's
a
--
the
pronouncement
of
a
very
(inaudible)
the
admission
of
a
new
state
by
whom
the
president
states
is
that
the
--
is
that
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
hawaii
become
a
state?
when
was
it
admitted?
when
congress
passed
the
--
measured?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
--
there
is
a
form
of
confirmation
or
whatever
it
is.
it
is
the
form
of
statement,
is
it
by
the
secretary
of
the
state,
i
don't
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
doesn't
fix
--
cut
off
periods
when
it
is
now
a
minute
before
it
wasn't
a
state,
then
there
comes
a
minute
when
it
is
a
state.
and
the
government
has
that
minute
of
control,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
claim
that
there's
an
antecedent
cause
(inaudible)
denominated
boundary
(inaudible)
and
in
the
case
of
--
if
you're
right,
then,
you
must
begin
somewhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
state
that
they
protect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
do
you
recommend,
mr.
hart.
may
i
ask
you,
who
were
the
authority
--
the
authoritative
spokesman
and
whom
the
house
--
and
the
house
and
the
senate
respectively,
whose
talk
or
remark
--
statement
that
would
ascertain
questions
are
relevant
to
--
and
one
of
those
are
the
things
that
every
time
they
can
carry
your
statement
even
the
house
or
the
senate,
doesn't
mind
me
trying
to
see
what
he
called
it
--
now,
who
spoke
with
authority
of
having
been
either
the
sponsors
or
in
charge
of
the
bill
or
in
charge
of
the
bill,
when
the
statement
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
three
senators
you
named
are
those
who
spoke
with
authority
of
being
in
charge,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
wouldn't
create
a
different
situation
from
the
situation
we
held,
if
the
court
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
make
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
--
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
was
based
or
derived
from
and
that's
the
direction
--
a
reliance
of
section
4
and
not
section
2.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
if
you
have
just
section
2
or
section
4,
does
not
have
the
function
that
you
have
cited,
isn't
that,
i
take
it,
your
answers
have
to
be
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
go
back
to
your
process
that
this
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
as
i
understood,
justice
harlan's
hypothesis,
it
was
an
explicit
reduction
in
the
--
in
the
act
of
accession
or
admission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
could
think
of
a
reasonable
interest
that
the
admission
was
conditioned,
at
least
the
power
of
the
united
states
is
concerned,
on
cutting
it
down,
the
unilateral
preexistence
found
as
explained
by
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
give
something
that
texas
never
had
or
some
other
states
never
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
rely
on
--
you
have
to
rely
on
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
being
that
kind
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
the
measure
--
but
what
our
problem
is
--
i
probably
think
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
overwrites
that.
but
the
measure
of
what
they
gratuitously
gave
related
to
some
boundaries
limit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
we
have
to
go
to
the
boundaries
and
that's
in
order
to
find
out
what
congress
out
of
abundance
of
generosity
it
gave
to
texas
and
so
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
into
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
vis-à-vis
other
countries,
any
different
whether
we
accept
the
government's
position
under
--
under
this
--
of
this
reading
of
the
statute
or
yours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hart,
in
particular,
i
noticed
the
decisions
of
the
use
of
the
most
conscientious
lawyers.
i
believe
that
the
court
decided
no
more
than
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it
must
be.
they
say
that
as
put
such
a
--
besides
definite,
almost
irrebuttable(inaudible)
boundary
equal
the
uniform
claim
to
the
(inaudible)
uniform
position
of
the
united
states
that
maritime
boundaries
are
--
do
not
go
beyond
three
miles
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
clearly
gets
down
to
the
claim
on
their
part
of
statutory
issues
giving
a
statutory
construction
whereby
boundaries
equal
three
miles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
could've
voted
for
those
two
amendments?
justice
felix
frankfurter
direct
when
you
say
recognize,
you
mean
that
the
united
states
recognized
the
republic,
although
it
has
such
a
boundary
or
it
simply
recognized
between
the
claims
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
a
--
that
we
recognize
exactly
that
has
a
claim
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
give
me
now
reason
to
speak
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
when
does
--
when
did
you
begin
to
speak
up?(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
--
as
sweeping
the
resistance
since
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that's
merely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
merely
goes
to
the
point
you
made
a
little
while
ago,
namely,
differentiations
between
objecting
to
what
other
countries
do
and
asserting
all
on
what
is
--
what
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
correct
or
desirable
or
just
call
it
what
you
will,
international
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
contended
to
establish
that
he
was

justice
felix

do
you
mean
there's
no

justice

(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general,
would
you
mind
telling
what
senator
anderson
meant
by
somewhere
around
when
they're
trying
to
upset
the
statement
when
you
might
be
able
to
say
what
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
make
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
i
infer
just
as
his
limit
--
his
desired
limitation
were
not
for
him.
the
state
department's
right
has
as
a
policy
of
--
has
confronted
the
profession
(inaudible)
should
go.
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
can
do
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
between
and
without
any
legislative
congressional
determination,
this
court
has
decided
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
be
it
in
imperium
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
wanted
to
cut
this
down,
i
didn't
make
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
gulf
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
didn't
--
they
couldn't
have
had
that
because
this
court
said
they
didn't
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
justice
--
if
i
understand
justice
black
said,
what
he
puts
to
you
that
they
said,
“we're
not
fighting
the
old
ground.”
they
couldn't.
i
mean,
they
couldn't
overrule,
the
congress
can't
overrule.
it
can
make
ineffective
decision
of
this
court
but
can't
overrule
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
after
the
california
and
texas
case,
there
were
determinations
by
this
court
that
the
state
had
no
proprietary
or
exploitive
right
in
the
contested
territory.
what
justice
black
is
putting
to
you
is
whether
the
claim
was
or
the
contention
was
that
there
were
certain
historic
boundaries
as
to
which
this
court
said,
“we
don't
care
really
of
what
they
were.
this
is
not
a
problem
of
proprietorship.”
that's
the
essential
holding,
isn't
it,
of
california
and
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
not
a
question
of
ownership.
when
the
government
submitted
its
decree
to
this
court
and
put
its
ownership,
this
court
wouldn't
accept
that
inclusion
in
the
decree.
that's
written.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
they
couldn't
have
said,
“we
owned
it,”
without
saying,
the
supreme
court
of
united
states'
decisions
are
defunctive
or
the
decisions
rather
don't
exist
and
we
overruled
it.
is
this
nearly
a
question
of
--
of
phrasing
between
you
and
the
question
put
to
you
by
justice
black
or
is
it
more
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
said
we
revert
to
what
we
call
for,
we
use
the
language
of
the
discussion,
the
historic
fact.
these
were
the
boundaries.
essentially,
the
supreme
court
said
that's
immaterial
for
the
controversy
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government's
right
to
exploit
these
--
these
interests,
and
now
a
different
question
arises,
namely,
whether
the
united
states
should
forego
that
--
which
the
supreme
court
had
given
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
what
they
claim?
the
difference
between
you
--
correct
me,
mr.
solicitor.
they
claimed
whatever
their
existing
boundaries
were
when
that
issue
becomes
relevant.
they
say,
it's
one
thing,
and
you
say
it's
another.
congress
didn't
do
something
for
the
state,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
laid
down
criteria
by
which
that
something
was
to
be
made
concrete,
and
that's
the
contest
between
the
two
sides.
justice
felix
frankfurter
applying
the
--
the
terms
with
the
criteria
by
which
something
was
to
be
done
for
the
state,
you
say
the
result
is
one
thing,
and
the
states
say
it's
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
there
is
a
difference
between
you
and,
let
me
say,
texas
as
to
what
the
texas
boundaries
were
when
tested
by
the
criterion
of
the
statute
existing
at
the
time,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
what
the
controversy
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
let
me
make
it
still
more
specific.
isn't
the
difference
between
you
and
them
that
they
accept
your
criteria
legal,
but
they
gave
a
content
to
what
is
a
legal
boundary
different
from
the
content
you
give
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
from
the
contention
that
their
content
is
the
statutory
content.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
statute
does
certainly
make
it
clear
that
congress
thought
that
one
state
might
have
three
miles
and
another
state
three
leagues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
i
mean
that
the
legal
possibility
that
one
state
may
have
a
larger
boundary
than
another
seaward
is
certainly
contemplated
by
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that's
why
we're
having
13
hours
of
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
approve
or
disapprove
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
question
is
open.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
may
i
ask
before
you
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
other
point.
it's
not
possible
to
--
justice
black
put
you
that
that's
right.
it's
not
possible
from
your
point
of
view
because
the
matter
has
already
been
adjudicated
or
because
according
to
the
relevant
evidence
by
which
legal
rights
will
establish
the
(inaudible)
the
relevant
evidence
whether
through
testimony
or
through
documents
or
judicial
notice
as
a
conclusion
based
on
that
evidence
before
a
tribunal,
the
tribunal
would
have
to
find
such
as
the
boundary
and
not
something
else.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we
are
in
the
realm
of
evidence,
whatever
the
--
the
whole
range
of
evidence,
whatever
may
be
deemed
relevant
evidence,
and
not
in
the
realm
of
determination
either
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
regarding
the
conclusion
or
by
this
court
as
a
matter
of
adjudication,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
opposite
isn't
the
fact
except
on
the
argumentation
of
foreign
policy
nor
the
other
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
you
disagree
that
all
those
other
important
facts
of
what
i
call
ademption.
there's
no
determination
by
the
congress
and
no
adjudication
by
a
court
for
what
we
are
discussing,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
qualify
(inaudible)
the
gulf,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
already
--
there's
already
a
part
of
(inaudible)
absolutely
three
miles
governed
everything
all
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
(inaudible)
from
the
gulf.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unless
the
government
is
right,
three
miles
covers
all
the
territory
of
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
reading
that
sentence,
this
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
the
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
texas
(inaudible).
now
what
is
that
--
where
--
what
was
the
(inaudible)
to
define.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
texas
incorporates
from
your
point
of
view
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
you'll
make
it
in
the
alternative
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question,
you
said
that
--
assuming
judicial
notice,
that's
what
i've
assumed
you
would
say
was
an
allowable
sweep,
otherwise
you
wouldn't
answer
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
need
any
evidence
or
any
--
any
establishment
of
proof.
other
than
that
or
which
can
read
in
books
or
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
is
anything
(inaudible)
my
purpose
really
to
--
your
question
is
that
--
that
on
your
conception
of
what
is
proper
judicial
notice,
the
evidence
is
in
our
--
we
can
see
(inaudible)
the
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
thinking
for
texas
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
louisiana
is
original,
it
had
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
have
no
such
oral
testimony
as
louisiana
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
a
take
a
minute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
governor
daniel,
would
you
take
a
minute
and
state
what
the
common
area
under
this
table
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
did
the
report
say
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
have
some
the
language
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
be
hooked
on
to
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
merely
suggesting
the
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
taking
(inaudible)
state,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
original
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
the
--
because
of
the
--
the
policy
of
our
nation
against
the
whole
world
regarding
three
miles,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
if
united
states
wanted
to
and
there
(inaudible)
the
war,
if
the
republic
of
texas
asserted
that
boundary,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
something
more?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
your
answer
to
justice
black's
question
that
considering
your
(inaudible)
of
our
national
policy
(inaudible)
this
country,
in
the
most
solemn
and
unquestionable
ways,
had
a
policy
vis-à-vis
all
other
nations
that
it
would
not
recognize
boundaries
beyond
three
miles
seaward.
are
you
--
are
you
answering
justice
black's
question
by
saying
therefore,
the
boundaries
of
any
other
nation
(inaudible)
before
the
court,
couldn't
be
--
be
more
than
three
miles
because
this
government
(inaudible),
is
that
your
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
question
of
foreign
policy
arises.
and
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
a
question
--
if
an
issue
of
foreign
policy
arises,
but
then
every
assertion
by
finland
or
iceland
as
to
what
its
boundaries
are,
that's
entirely
(inaudible)
of
determination
by
this
country
of
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
fact
says
there
must
be
a
boundary
nevertheless
in
the
meantime,
you
can't
--
there's
no
boundary
(inaudible)
comes
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
follow
--
does
it
follow,
based
on
your
premise,
that
our
foreign
--
the
national
policy
was
the
three
miles.
that
this
government
would
tell
its
citizen,
you
go
ahead
and
do
what
you
seek
outside
of
three
miles
although
the
foreign
nations
(inaudible).
does
it
follow?
i
don't
think
it
follows
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
lot
of
generalized
claims
made
by
this
government
regarding
foreign
relations
after
which
it
(inaudible)
not
direct
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
are
ready
to
take
the
consequences
of
our
position
even
throughout
the
places
or
diplomatic
negotiations
ultimately
through
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but,
mr.
solicitor,
legal
transactions
might
take
place
within
the
territories
of
this
government
wasn't
recognized
in
its
relation
with
other
countries.
now,
the
legal
transaction
may
nevertheless
be
validated
or
recognized
by
this
court
if
it
doesn't
affect
anything
with
the
united
states.
so
you
can't
say
either
is
or
isn't
the
territory
or
boundary
so
far
as
this
country
is
concerned,
a
boundary
with
a
relationship
country,
not
a
boundary
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
at
the
time
of
the
convention
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
this
is
--
there's
any
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
--
they
claim
that
they
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
convention
adopted
but
they
(inaudible)
then
the
boundaries
between
the
texas
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible).
now
my
question
was,
was
this
(inaudible)
one
of
the
arguments?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
in
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
explicitly
in
controversy,
what
--
this
could
be
in
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
account
of
the
convention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
want
to
explain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
there
could
be
such
a
policy,
i
can't
think
these
statutes
clearly
indicate
there
could
mean
such
a
policy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
--
because
you
submit
that
if
they
can
prove
it,
they
can
get
it.
congress
therefore
had
said,
we
(inaudible)
what
this
general
language
will
say,
it
has
been
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
by
saying
that
if
they
can
prove
it
that
the
foreign
policy
now,
changes
both
handle
at
least,
by
the
government.
they
did
make
a
--
they
did
make
a
statement
on
this
foreign
policy
that
is
besides
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i
don't
think
you
confide
that
statute
said
they
shall
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
statute
contemplated
that
they
might
prove
that
that
was
--
that
if
they
can
prove
that,
then
retroactively
to
do
--
will
congress
change
the
foreign
policy
and
congress
retroactively
obtains
what
is
legal
or
is
not
and
it
would
be
a
good
commerce
that
we'll
witness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
follow
that
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
impliedly
the
statute
too
--
that
it
might
have
been
either
it
wasn't
eight,
nine
--
when
was
that
1848?
1825,
the
foreign
policy
in
relation
to
the
gulf
or
that
we
now
reach
back
to
be
declared
that
you
have
been
to
foreign
policy
in
1825,
provided,
they
covered
as
a
proof
that
you'll
acquire.
or
you
--
i'm
not
saying
that
the
period
of
time
to
indicate
this
is
hardly
moving.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
a
chance
to
deliver
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
really
the
milk
and
the
coconut
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
supreme
court
voiced,
just
to
bail
them
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
one
could
produce
materials
to
show
the
proponents
of
these
(inaudible)
and
the
proponents
of
the
ones
who
concede
as,
it
didn't
express
every
time
on
what
might
we
called
legally
considered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
very
fact
that
you've
mentioned,
that
nobody
is
supposed
to
give
them
something
out
of
hand,
just
the
(inaudible)
of
rule
of
presumption
that
were
invoked.
that
grants
by
the
government
can
speak
if
it's
true.
so
that
really,
if
that
arises,
i
think
that
that's
aware
that
the
government
does
hand
out
larger.
here,
there
was
a
real
(inaudible)
contest
over
the
year
and
a
fluctuating
added
to
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
about
where
else
can
say
including
that
term
of
laws
undefined,
press-relating
standards,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
another
factor
in
this
covered
by
your
innominate
(inaudible)
i
think
that
legislative
means
as
the
problem
is
complicated
by
the
various
claimants
and
the
different
degree
of
--
of
confidence
that
you
have
in
your
texas
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
this,
you
could
have
a
differentiated
--
a
differentiation
among
the
states,
so
that
they
wouldn't
know
what
happens
together,
you
might
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
point
is
that
there's
a
special
interest
that
specializes
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
number
1.
(inaudible)
1115
and
1116
and
--
and
joined
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
one
in
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
from
any
line
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
prominently
suggesting
there
were
211
pages
of
footnote
refer
only
to
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
to
go
through
the
211
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
satisfy
one
self
directly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
“to
wit”
cuts
down
the
act
of
december
19th
as
if
to
with
the
limit
anything
that
might
be
found
to
be
beyond
what
--
what
follows
“to
wit”
in
the
text
you're
reading?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
“to
wit”
curtails
anything
that
was
approved
on
december
19
that
goes
beyond
the
language
following
“to
wit”
clause
or
“to
wit”
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
that
part
of
the
statute
and
nothing
else,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
why
does
--
did
your
argument
has
any
significance
to
imply
that
the
three-league
were
deleted
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
were
not
included
in
the
language
that
follow
phrase
“to
wit”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
way
you
read
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
cuts
down
what
the
statute
says
and
restricted
nearly
to
what
it
follows
“to
wit”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
two-edged
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
they
didn't
--
were
to
refuse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
talk
about
a
thing
because
it's
not
--
nobody
can
tell.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
light
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
everybody
accepted
it?
i'm
not
saying
everybody
did
but
if
it
is
to
the
matter
of
court,
even
careful
lawyers
don't
always
spell
out
things
that
matters
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
it
be
translated
into
miles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
it
isn't
with
boundary
but
i
would
like
to
know
so
that
coast
or
shore
indicates
how
many
miles
out
from
the
--
from
the
actual
foot
of
land
from
the
coast
when
you
say
coast
and
shore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can
go
out
three
miles
of
any
--
at
any
rate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
three
miles?
because
the
statute
said
it
or
national
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
policy
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
get
the
three
miles
from,
is
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
because
the
station
have
left
into
three
miles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
determines
the
louisiana's
boundary
of
the
state
not
the
national
boundary
but
three
miles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
23
miles
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
you,
that
the
three
miles,
our
virtue
of
section
4
of
the
act
under
consideration
and
not
three
miles
as
of
the
time
that
louisiana
came
into
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
what
document
do
i
find
the
answer?
what
document
can
i
clearly
find
out
the
three
miles
the
time
louisiana
came
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
original
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
government
arguing
that
the
national
boundary
and
the
state
boundaries
must
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
boundary
never
can
be
larger
or
broader
than
--
larger
than
the
national
boundary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wouldn't
it
be
--
might
--
might
not
be
foreign
territory
or
it
might
be
nobody's
territory
therefore
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it
isn't
foreign
territory
even
when
the
--
our
national
policy,
is
it?
it
isn't
foreign
territory
i
hope
and
isn't
nobody's
territory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody
has
access
to
it.
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
you
say
it's
for
the
government,
but
i
say
it
belonged
to
nobody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
ultimately
fair.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
from
your
point
of
view,
the
national
boundaries
were
suggestively
two
miles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
adding
that
qualification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
you
answer?
although
they
would
get
three
leagues
if
that's
what
they
have
when
they
came
in,
although
the
national
boundary
from
your
point
of
view
in
this
degree
was
three
miles,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
the
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
say
the
national
boundary
of
this
country
is
three
miles
and
has
been
time
out
of
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
guess
following
justice
black's
question,
again,
if
they
can
establish
within
the
criteria
of
this
act
of
1953,
a
particular
state
might
have
a
boundary
that's
extended
beyond
the
national
boundary,
that
is
correct,
isn't
it,
if
it
can
establish
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
been
--
the
national
boundary
for
everybody
else
is
three
miles
which
were
x-based
including
three
--
three-league
and
therefore
pro
tanto,
that's
the
national
boundary
of
the
united
states,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

satisfaction,
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
national
boundary
was
in
--
on
the
critical
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
you
take
--
talk
about
a
national
boundary,
which
is
you
say
three-mile,
but
if
texas
in
fact
has
three-league
once
it
came
in,
and
by
admission,
that
was
legally
recognized
by
congress
and
is
your
way.
congress
deemed
that
the
--
that
the
boundary
of
texas
which
is
three-league
and
it
brought
texas
in
on
those
terms,
on
three
league
terms,
i
will
say
that
this
texas
thereby
became
part
of
the
united
states,
part
of
the
nations
of
the
united
states,
that
now
the
national
boundary
of
the
united
states
was
three
miles
for
everybody,
but
for
the
texas
part,
it
was
three
leagues
and
therefore,
the
national
boundary
of
the
united
states,
pro
tanto,
of
texas
is
three
leagues.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
do
you
have
to
look
in
to
foreign
policy?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
not
be
your
fault.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
have
to
be
because
united
states
may
not
protect,
united
states
may
not
(inaudible)
of
the
other
nation
care
to
protect
that
part
of
it
if
it
chose
not
to.
and
the
notion
--
that's
--
that's
my
difficulty
that
you
think
it's
a
mathematical
composition
that
the
national
boundary
with
reference
to
the
--
when
you
discuss
states
boundary,
you
discuss
the
national
boundary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
pleases
you,
if
it
pleases
you
or
anybody
else
to
say
that
means
the
particular
state
is
part
of
the
united
states,
therefore,
that's
a
part
of
united
states,
that's
all
right.
i
get
no
--
i
get
no
help
to
--
for
this
problem
out
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
defend
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
go
to
war,
defend
may
simply
means
writing
a
protesting
note.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
to
you
my
difficulty
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
your
position.
you
are
so
preoccupied
with
determined
to
your
satisfaction
with
all
the
weight
of
the
evidence
that
you
pursue
that
the
national
policy
of
the
united
states
was
three
miles
that
you
regard
that
almost
that
was
necessary
infusion
into
for
the
existing
boundary,
in
the
1948,
for
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
derives
you
--
you're
almost
--
you
don't
say
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
become
might
be
close
to
saying
that
the
national
policy
of
the
three-mile
belt
is
so
powerful
and
so
important
that
it
almost
makes
impossible
giving
proper
heed
to
what
the
special
facts
pertaining
to
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
anybody
disagree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
in
--
except
on
boundary
that
annexed
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
not
clear
and
as
to
never,
you've
very
kind
about.
all
i'm
saying
is,
in
connection
with
--
and
as
you've
just
stated
your
proposition,
i
don't
think
there's
any
(inaudible)
and
i
find
myself
not
at
being
what
you
said.
but
you
--
but
(inaudible)
me,
wasn't
it?
what
i
could
from
your
argument
is
that
you
are
so
the
--
the
national
three-mile
policy
is
so
imperative
in
your
thinking
but
you
revolve
the
conflict
to
a
deference,
that
governor
daniel
stated
as
the
policy
if
the
system.
the
usual
and
normal
procedure
upon
the
admission
of
a
state
to
which
mr.
justice
black
in
his
(inaudible)
statement,
namely,
that
the
circumstances
or
the
prospects
of
the
attitude
of
congress
supposing
what
was
said
and
not
said
in
regarding
the
boundaries
of
a
state,
the
manner
in
which
the
boundary
of
a
state
are
determined
when
a
state
comes
in.
and
that
for
me
is
very
blatant
if
i
didn't
know
about
this
until
i
was
told.
if
normally
a
state
defined
its
boundary,
if
normally
a
state
presents
it's
application
if
it
were
for
admission,
if
it
sets
forth
the
terms
of
admission,
then
it's
nothing
you
said
about
it
presumably
go
extend,
or
accepted
by
the
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
part
of
your
argument.
but
the
emphasis
of
your
argument
for
me
has
been
that
although
--
that
--
that
the
overwriting
and
almost
overwriting
factor
is
that
you
extended
it
into
a
large
--
becoming
on
more
than
three
miles
would
be
a
denial
of
deep-rooted
national
policy.
isn't
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
if
you
go
beyond
that,
if
you
go
beyond
that,
you
almost
want
an
affirmative
insertion
in
the
act
of
admission
that
they
did
grant
them
to
be,
almost.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
true,
isn't
that
the
(inaudible)
of
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
other
than
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
other
than
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
controversy
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
government
--
what
was
giving
permission
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
to
the
railroad
and
whatnot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
less
than
that
--
nobody
thought
it
was
less
than
that,
that
is
just
you
cleared.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
--
this
could
be
a
question
of
a
price
of
a
vessel
of
sea
within
the
three-mile
limit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
the
claim
of
the
--
of
the
seizure
--
of
the
seizure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
as
a
geographically,
it
was
beyond
the
three-mile,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
that
nobody
thought
that
we
had
lesser
right
and
--
within
the
three-mile
limit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
if
--
if
it
was
within
the
three
miles,
then
the
seizure
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
invalid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
lord
stowell
wouldn't
recognize
it
and
nobody
else
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
english
ship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
britisher
seized
it
and
the
question,
whether
he
could
keep
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
know
what
lord
stowell
would
have
said
if
it
has
been
found
outside
of
three
miles.
he
was
rather
--
he
was
rather
nationalistic
in
his
interpretation
as
far
as
law,
as
we
all
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
found
it
wasn't
so
the
legal
question
doesn't
arise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is,
he
would
have
said,
“i
don't
care,
whether
three
miles
or
five.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
res
judicata
does
not
apply
to
thompson's
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
res
judicata
does
not
apply
to
thompson's
brief
or
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
thompson
take
whatever
position
he
sees
desirable
for
the
case
in
hand.
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
point
is
that
the
--
that
the
constitution
that
was
presented
for
re-representation
would
have
been
kept
and
scrutinized,
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
for
the
number
of
the
second
one
senator
holland?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
constitutions
while
they
were
submitted
was
in
response
to
the
act
of
march
2nd,
1967
calling
for
such
submission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
other
--
other
constitutions
of
the
states
as
it
weren't
suspended
as
part
of
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
phrase
of
the
act
was,
for
instance,
constitution
shall
have
been
submitted
to
congress
for
examination
and
approval
and
congress
shall
have
approved
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
if
the
document,
would
you
say
constitute
such
formal
approval?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
constitution
call
for
a
particular
boundary
or
particular
claim
by
states
that
either
seek
submission
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
seven
states
that
sought
of
pre-representation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
relevance
of
that
thing
to
what
you
called
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
florida,
in
seeking
again
their
representations
to
congress,
couldn't
constitutionally
submit
a
constitution,
which
is
required
for
being
submitted
and
take
a
portion
of
another
--
a
portion
of
another
state,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
senator
holland,
i
didn't
mean
to
mislead
you
by
suggesting,
by
implying
that
boundaries
submitted
by
florida,
if
the
claim
of
florida
were
to
be
sustained,
would
have
involved
taking
something
that
belonged
to
another
state
which
constitutionally
couldn't
be
done.
what
i
meant
to
suggest
is
that
since
other
portions
of
the
boundary
of
florida,
not
relating
to
our
problems,
might
have
done
that.
presumably,
when
the
constitution
was
submitted
with
boundaries,
it's
a
little
difficult
to
say
that
congress
paid
no
attention
to
boundaries
that
the
boundaries
were
irrelevant
to
the
action
which
it
took
in
accepting
the
submission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
that
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
what
--
what
comment
do
you
make
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
act
of
1867
contemplated
the
boundaries
that
theretofore
existed
in
view
of
the
debates
that's
in
opinion
indulged
in
striking
out
the
so
called
that
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
how
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
haven't
thought
that.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
inadvertence
was
not
--
he
put
in
words,
but
he
didn't
mean
to
put
in.
inadvertence
was,
as
you
thought,
was
a
misconstruction
of
what
he
wrote,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
mean
to
write
what
he
wrote.
it
doesn't
mean
that
could
be
used
in
the
way
in
which
you
say
it
should
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
say
we
got
that
as
a
matter
of
international
law
and
not
because
his
catholic
majesty
ceded
it
to
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
cede
what
he
didn't
have
according
to
your
views.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
no
antecedent
to
that
expansion
as
you
call
it,
except
what
was
written
by
the
constitution
made
as
a
part.
did
they
--
that
this
is
an
act
of
creation
on
their
part
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
floridas
--
any
claim
by
floridas
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
congress
specifically,
in
the
act
of
1968,
took
care
of
that
by
saying
that
was
adopted
by
large
majority
of
the
votes
cast
at
the
election.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
state
had
the
right
to
modify
its
requirement
and
qualify
the
condition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
make
an
offer
to
you
and
you
can't
meet
it
fully,
but
i
can
say
very
well
you
met
it
sufficiently
and
i
accept
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
if
they
--
if
they
specifically
abandon
one
of
their
requirements
and
say
nothing
about
others.
i
now
use
your
expressio
unius,
i
don't
think
much
of
that
is
a
guiding
consideration
deciding
cases
but
i'll
take
it
for
your
purpose.
if
they
specifically
qualify
a
limitation
in
their
1967
act,
i
would
--
i
think
i
can
fairly
say
they
didn't
qualify
anything
else.
and
when
they
set
examinations
and
approval
presumably,
they
meant
to
examine
in
order
to
approve
a
discipline.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
you
ought
not
to
skip
what
you're
skipping.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
pursuance
of
the
provisions
of
an
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
from
--
and
for
me,
that
incorporate
that
from
1867.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
act
of
1867
wasn't
organic
and
important
as
you've
indicated
and
everybody
else
does,
a
terrifically
important
piece
of
legislation
there
is
to
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't,
and
when
the
--
when
the
second
act
refers
to
prior
act,
the
prior
act
can't
be
read
out
of
existence,
instead
we
must
only
look
at
the
words
of
the
second
act
which
relates
to
and
is
in
response
to
the
prior
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
two
will
work
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
depends
who
does
the
debating.
this
business
of
picking
everything
out
of
anything
that's
said
on
the
floor
of
either
of
house,
it
seems
to
me
a
very
dangerous
way
with
which
to
deal
with
legislation.
if
some
authoritative
statesman,
somebody
who
had
charge
of
the
--
of
the
act
of
1868
say
that
we're
only
concerned
with
whether
there
is
a
republic
form
of
government,
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
contradicts
what
thaddeus
stevens
said
then,
even
said
then,
didn't
it,
certainly.
if
you
say
all
they
were
concerned
with
was
whether
it's
a
republican
form
of
government
and
they
were
rejected
or
some
of
them
were
rejected
because
they
weren't
properly
adopted,
the
case
asserts
more
things
than
a
republic
form
of
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
but
evidently,
congress
was
also
thinking
about
those.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
then
thaddeus
stevens
doesn't
confine
or
define
the
limits
of
what
was
implied
in
their
re-representation
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
would
be
that
the
reconstruction
controversy
was
whether
these
bodies
were
really
legal
bodies
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
can't
sit
here
and
say,
well,
it
wasn't
a
constitution
at
all
therefore,
you
rejected
it.
evidently,
i
don't
know
how
and
what
you
tell
me
but
they
gave
three
grounds,
one
of
which
was
procedural
inadequacy
of
adoption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
and
--
and
there
was
--
there
was
non-compliance
as
you
say
with
the
majority
votes
and
congress
had
specifically
wager,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
even
that
isn't
a
question
of
republican
form
of
government,
of
course
to
our
great
(inaudible)
i
think
it
was
part
of
the
voting
sometimes
around
in
this
country
less
than
the
majority
of
those
entitled
to
vote.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that
is
--
my
point
is
that
apparently,
that
wasn't
the
only
thing
congress
was
concerned
with.
we
call
--
it
specifically
said,
“we
adopt
this,
we
recognize
the
states
or
a
written
representation,”
although
they
not
--
did
not
comply
with
the
specific
requirements
and
instead
of
shutting
their
eyes,
they
specifically
dealt
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
overstating
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
anymore
necessary
than
claiming
the
boundaries
that
they
didn't
have,
why
is
that
anymore?
it
seems
to
me
for
a
state
who
claim
what
is
probably
beyond
legal
authority,
according
to
your
view,
is
no
more
or
no
less
important
than
to
have
a
constitution
adopted
by
a
meager
vote.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
i
also
been
taking
judicial
notice
that
the
most
frequent
controversy
in
the
american
civil
life
among
the
states
is
the
boundary
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
true
of
the
earlier
constitutions,
isn't
it?
but
what
was
(inaudible)
and
the
constitutions
that
were
rejected
earlier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
its
unsatisfactory
condition
was
a
rather
new
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
again
with
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
were
preoccupied
with
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
others
had
to
be
that
the
other
provisions
would
have
been
deleted
or
everything
else
is
in
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
the
men
in
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
were
indifferent
to
everything
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
silence
of
it
determined
whether
a
state
is
republican?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
that
--
i
am
going
to
ask
you.
do
you
think
thaddeus
stevens
would
have
written
what
the
chief
justice
chase
later
wrote,
it's
an
indestructible
union,
indestructible
state?
do
you
think
he
would
have
in
the
light
of
all
we
know
about
his
views.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
went
out
--
it
went
out
beyond
the
control
of
the
--
of
the
remaining
so
called
union
states.
the
union
could
do
what
they
wanted
to
please.
they
could
send
in
governors
(inaudible)
and
keep
them
under
subjection
as
long
as
that
part
of
congress
thought
would
bring
them
to
appropriate
(inaudible)
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
weren't
--
to
that
extent,
they
weren't
out
of
control
of
the
--
or
sovereignty,
but
they
were
out
as
in
the
sanction
which
the
chief
justice
in
texas
against
white
said
they
were
an
indestructible
states
and
had
been,
it's
never
been
out.
do
you
think
thaddeus
stevens
thought
they
were
never
out.
that
states
with
all
the
rights
of
the
constitution
gives
the
various
members
of
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
we
mean
by
states.
we
don't
mean
a
piece
of
territory
subject
to
a
central
government
control.
we
mean
a
political
--
having
the
political
rights
of
states.
that's
what
we
mean
by
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
did
that
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
that
conditions
could
have
been
imposed
by
congress
for
the
re-exercise
--
for
the
re-exercise
of
the
right
they
had
in
1860
or
1869.
what
do
you
say
that
the
condition,
the
claims
or
conditions
under
which,
they
sought
to
get
those
functions
as
of
all
did
not
include
anything
they
may
have
said
in
their
submission
of
a
constitution
within
the
boundaries,
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
the
constitution
of
oklahoma
another
record
1911
run
about
there,
i
think
that
also
had
a
(inaudible)
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
procedure.
and
that
was
carefully
scrutinized
not
only
by
the
congress,
but
the
president
of
united
states.
that
has
been
rejected
in
order
(inaudible).
why
do
you
say
congress
(inaudible)
document
by
the
constitution
which
the
important
right
to
be
(inaudible)
was
involved,
that
they
wouldn't
examine
too
many
sections.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
to
prevail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
maybe
that
they
found
these
objectionable
and
the
others
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
they
can
find
out
which
of
the
22
that
interested
them
unless
they
went
through
the
whole.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
one
the
most
distinguished
members
of
the
congress
in
my
lifetime.
that's
probably
nine
tenth
of
the
bill
that
attacked
by
the
congress
are
not
read
by
more
than
one
tenth
of
its
membership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
they
mean
--
what
did
congress
mean
or
what
was
the
legislation.
they
all
get
in
trouble
when
i
ask
what
congress
means
that
nobody
can
ever
find
that
out,
yet
they
probably
express
themselves.
what
did
they
--
what
was
meant
by
the
act
of
1867
when
it
used
the
word
approval.
we
want
you
to
submit
something
that
we
will
examine
line
by
line
and
by
line
by
line
approved.
did
they
mean
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
they
mean
of
approval
in
1867
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
gunn
and
barry
help
you
mr.
swarth.
i
just
looked
at
it.
that
simply
says
that
merely
because
the
provisions
in
the
state
constitution
of
georgia
allowed
exemption,
it
couldn't
affect
prior
(inaudible)
this
created,
because
that
would
involve
(inaudible)
obligation
of
context.
how
does
that
--
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know,
but
you
can't
just
take
words
out
of
a
case
and
find
significance.
what
they
have
said
in
this
that
--
that
this
conflict
(inaudible)
this
provision
gave
authority
so
far
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
concerned,
you
can
go
ahead
and
do
it.
it
doesn't
mean
prior
existing
rights
were
wiped
out
and
it
didn't
mean
any
new
federal
right
created
by
it.
it
simply
said,
we
let
you
come
back
(inaudible),
we
let
you
come
back
on
these
conditions,
isn't
that
all
it
means
by
approval?
i
should
pick
the
phrase
sanction,
shows
that
they
put
their
stand
of
confirmation
upon
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
reconstruction
act
as
i
read
it
of
1867
didn't
lay
down
certain
criteria.
they
have
formulated
conditions
of
--
they
said
how
a
constitution
should
be
adopted
and
then
said,
you
bring
it,
we
will
examine
it
and
approve
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
gunn
against
barry
did
not
say
the
congress
didn't
approve
it;
gunn
against
barry
dealt
with
the
legal
consequences
of
that
approval.
