justice
potter
stewart
as
in
the
case
of
texas,
the
boundaries
could
not
have
existed
longer
than
nine
years
did
they?
that
was
the
duration
of
the
life
of
that
republic
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
their
boundaries
were
they
couldn't
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
by
insisting
called
the
right
of
innocent
passage.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
i
would
apply
that
to
just
a
small
craft
and
my
craft.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
afraid,
why
would
they
have
to
anchor
anymore
than
to
anchor
now,
three
miles
out.
they
have
a
right
of
innocent
passage.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
at
least
be
a
line
--
imaginary
line
from
the
coast
out
to
that
point.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
a
number
of
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
too
that
the
whole
concept
of
the
rights
to
the
subsoil
under
the
sea,
a
substantial
distance
from
the
shore
is
a
relatively
new
concept,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
1848,
i
suppose
nobody
knows
for
that
except
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
perhaps
for
the
purpose
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
fishing
and
--[laughter]
--
and
the
kind
of
fish
that
stayed
put
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean,
oysters
and
things.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
but
what
are
the
boundaries
of
texas
today
in
the
gulf
of
mexico?
justice
potter
stewart
who
--
what
was
the
percentage
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
a
private
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
was
that
--
where
does
that
statement
appears?
justice
potter
stewart
along
the
line
of
mr.
justice
black's
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
united
states
of
america
(inaudible)
that
be
denied,
asking
on
at
least
alternatively,
that
this
court
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
also
ask
me
for
summary
judgment
in
your
behalf
in
your
prayer?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
wasn't
entirely
clear
to
me
as
to
--
as
to
whether
he
shouldn't
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
whether
he
had
--
need
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
the
government
has.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
but
i
--
is
it
also
in
this
statute
(inaudible)
found
the
language
about
the
unappropriated
--
unappropriated
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
same
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
there
is
a
claim
made
that
that
--
perhaps
not
intentionally
at
the
time
but
by
its
terms,
by
what
it
means
could
have
--
could
have
(inaudible)
the
discussion
here.
justice
potter
stewart
did
that
convention
also
provide
that
in
article
ii
that
until
the
remaining
portions
shall
be
marked
out
that
the
--
that
the
rest
of
the
--
the
rest
of
the
boundary
shall
get
--
before
the
rest
of
boundary,
each
of
those
sovereignty
should
exercise
without
interference
with
the
other,
their
historic
territory
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
true
too,
isn't
it,
that
--
that
this
boundary
that
we're
now
talking
about
was
not
included
within
the
--
in
the
agenda
of
a
convention
at
that
time?
justice
potter
stewart
to
that
extent,
it
was
not
only
--
not
in
controversy,
but
it
was
agreed
that
the
historic
boundary
should
continue
to
prevail,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
say
that
both
have
power,
do
you
mean
that
either
one
independently
has
power
or
that
it
requires
both?
justice
potter
stewart
that
each
has
power.
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
solicitor,
are
you
suggesting
that
except
for
this
non-existence
statute
there'd
be
no
way
that
texas
could
prove
this
departure
limits?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
admission
statutes,
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
well,
you
don't
suggest
there
any
other
materials
except
those
which
texas
has
offered
us
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
basically
the
materials
are
the
same.
the
rebuttal
merely
go
to
explanations
of
the
basic
materials,
don't--
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
i'm
getting
to
all
the
materials
are
here,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
put
an
interpretation
upon
them
which
is
that
they
do
not
establish
what
texas
says
they
established.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
that
union
pacific
was
a
grant
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
any,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
were
--
were
these
issues
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
wasn't
a
question.
they
were
claiming
it,
weren't
they?
that
was
not
open
to
question.
that
was
a
very
clear
statute
metes
and
bounds
in
1836.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
question
raised
as
to
whether
they
were
claiming,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
with
something
else,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor,
but
then
i
have
for
almost
two
days
now
and
that
we've
been
talking
about
the
same
thing.
but
does
it
all
summed
up
to
this
so
far
as
the
government's
position
is
concerned?
that
all
of
the
relevant
materials
establish
that
as
of
the
time
at
least
as
regards
texas,
that
texas
was
admitted
to
the
union,
the
three-mile
limit
had
been
established
affirmatively
as
a
matter
of
federal
and
national
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
all
of
the
materials
which
you
say
under
proper
interpretation
of
the
1953
statute,
texas
must
apply,
must
show
that
there
was
a
departure
from
the
established
three-mile
policy
favorable
to
texas
and
that
none
of
those
materials
permit
that
inference,
therefore
that
texas
has
not
established
the
burden
imposed
upon
it
under
the
1953
statute?
and
therefore
its
claim
must
fail.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all
there
is
to
the
government's
brief.
the
incidence
go
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
a
lot
of
coloration,
but
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
the
essence
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
don't
you
also
have
an
alternative
argument
based
on
even
though
arguendo,
assuming
that
the
--
that
the
republic
of
texas
had
a
boundary
of
three
leagues
from
the
shore.
still,
at
the
time
it
became
a
member
of
the
union
since
that
that
--
it
then
as
a
member
of
union,
its
boundaries
could
not
go
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
of
america
that
at
that
moment,
its
boundaries
were
three
miles
from
the
shore
isn't
that
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
the
other
way
around.
the
government
doesn't
persuade
us
as
to
either
the
affirmative
proposition,
namely
that
it
was
three
miles
at
the
time,
or
that
texas
has
failed
to
establish
that
there
was
a
departure
from
the
three
miles,
if
there
was.
the
non-materials
before
us
made
texas
prevail
here?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sachse,
before
you
proceed,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
--
completely
understood
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
as
to
what
your
claim
is.
you
claim
three
leagues
from
the
coast
and
you
equate
the
word,
“coast”
with
mainland
and
shoreline
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
well,
in
other
words,
the
coast
then
consists
of
these
very
islands,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
coast
consists
of
the
shoreline
of
the
seaward
shoreline
of
these
islands
extended
by
imaginary
lines
extending
between
or
among
it,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
roughly?
justice
potter
stewart
well
take
for
example
islands
like
the
chandeleur
islands.
they're
pretty
well
up
the
actual
mainland,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
as
you
get
north
without
your
getting
feet
wet.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
certainly
there's
no
question
but
that
their
part
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
those
islands.
justice
potter
stewart
now
as
your
coast
--
your
claim
is
that
your
coast
at
that
point
begins
there
and
that
your
territorial
boundary
goes
out
three
leagues
from
there?
from
the
seaward
coast
to
the
chandeleur
islands?
justice
potter
stewart
from
mississippi.
justice
potter
stewart
but
aside
from
that
--
aside
from
that
problem,
does
your
point
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sure
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
but
just
--
so
that
i
can
understand
what
we're
talking
about
in
a
general
way.
it
is
true
then
that
you
claim
that
the
coast
itself
may
be
several
miles
away
from
the
actual
mainland
shoreline,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
in
this
argument
distinguished
between
--
or
at
least
in
your
overall
claims
distinguished
between
the
word,
“coast”
on
the
one
hand
and
the
word
“shore”
or
“land”
on
the
other,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sachse,
may
i
ask?
i
notice
that
the
397
shorelines
in
miles,
that
you've
been
telling
on
the
shore
line
as
you
mean
for
this
coastline
(inaudible)
the
inland
and
the
deep
water
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
something
different
in
shorelines,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
they
call
it
shore?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sachse,
before
you
sit
down,
just
a
present
question
i
asked
you
earlier,
to
extend
it
a
little
bit.
you've
told
us
that
you
distinguish
between
the
word
“coast”
and
the
word
like
“mainland”
or
“shore”
or
“land”,
the
“coast”
means
something
else.
“coast”
means
where
inland
waters
meet
the
sea,
is
that
right
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
defined
by
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
and
that
this
--
and
you
assert
that
louisiana's
territorial
boundary
extends
three
leagues
beyond
coast
as
so
defined,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
of
geographical
fact,
are
there
any
islands
within
three
leagues
from
the
coast
as
you
define
the
word
“coast”?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
all
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
north
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
toward
mainland.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
from
the
coastline,
i'm
asking
now,
from
the
coastline
as
you've
defined
the
word
“coast”
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
are
there
any
islands
seawardly
within
three
leagues?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
what?
disappeared?
justice
potter
stewart
my
thought,
for
example,
is
and
i
haven't
got
the
map
of
louisiana
visually
before
me,
but
if
the
actual
shorelines
say
of
the
chandeleur
islands
is
part
of
the
coastline,
as
you've
defined
it,
there
are
no
islands
within
three
leagues
seawardly
of
there,
are
there,
going
to
louisiana?
justice
potter
stewart
except
the
very
meaning
of
the
--
their
claim
depends
upon
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast
and
if
there
are
no
islands,
or
if
not
many
islands
as
any
substitute
in
the
coast,
three
leagues
in
the
coast
as
now
defined,
this
would
be
a
factor
in
construing
the
meaning
of
that
description,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
doesn't
--
the
use
of
the
word
--
the
phrase,
“along
the
boundary”
mean
that
the
instructions
were
to
use
that
part
to
--
that
part
of
the
boundary
along
that
boundary
in
the
negotiation.
it
doesn't
say
to
incorporate
the
entire
boundary.
he's
just
referring
to
that
part
of
the
boundary
that's
in
dispute,
isn't
that
a
fair
construction?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
let's
say
we
have
a
500-mile
boundary,
we
can
negotiate
for
10
miles
along
that
boundary.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
think
you're
mistaken,
mr.
solicitor.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
black
line
is
a
line
parallel
to
and
three-league
--
three
leagues
distant
from
a
line
delineated
by
the
coast
guard
seaward
of
which
the
international
rules
on
the
road
applied
to
navigation
and
manner
of
which
the
inland
rules
of
the
road
apply.
justice
potter
stewart
the
latter
one
being
the
coast
according
to
louisiana
and
the
black
line
being
three
leagues
seaward
of
the
coast.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
saying
their
position
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
the
answer
would
depend,
mr.
solicitor
general,
wouldn't
it
upon
the
specific
geography
of
the
coastline
involved?
if
you
have
a
straight
coast
along
the
sea,
there
would
be
no
difference
between
the
shore
and
the
coast,
each
would
be
identical
but
if
you
had
islands
and
bays
and
inland
waters
and
so
on,
then
you
--
the
shore
might
be
a
different
line
from
the
coast
line,
isn't
that
about
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
you
can't
give
categorical
answer
because
it
would
depend
upon
the
geography
of
a
specific
area?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
mr.
solicitor
general,
that's
not
the
test
of
this
statute,
is
it?
it's
not
where
the
boundaries
are
today.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
state's
boundaries
as
of
the
time
they
became
members
of
the
union
or
as
“heretofore”
approved
by
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
has
nothing
with
what
the
boundaries
are
of
the
states
today.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
of
that
time.
now,
there
may
well
be
a
three
--
three-mile
boundary
around
the
continent
of
united
states
today,
not
an
inch
beyond
that
and
still,
they
--
on
the
state's
point
of
view
if
they
could
show
that
their
boundary
in
1845
or
1868
or
whatever
the
critical
date
is
involved,
was
a
certain
amount
and
that's
the
measure,
the
measure
to
which
certain
proprietary
rights
have
been
relinquished
by
the
congress,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
without
records
to
what
that
boundary
may
be
today.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
being
addressed.
justice
potter
stewart
as
of
that
particular
date.
justice
potter
stewart
if
and
only
if
your
--
your
construction
of
the
words
“at
the
time
of”
is
the
proper
one.
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
if
the
state's
construction
of
the
words
“at
the
time
of”
i.e.
not
after
but
just
prior
to
becoming
a
union
that
it
wouldn't
have
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
our
national
boundary,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
except,
of
course,
in
those
case
of
those
dates
which
were
territories.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
even
by
that
reasoning
the
republic
of
texas
didn't
have
any
boundaries
at
all.
it
was
only
in
existence
for
nine
years,
and
you
say
that's
not
long
enough
to
be
in
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
is
your
point
that
there
are
no
islands
beyond
four
leagues?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there
is
no
point
in
saying
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
before.
justice
potter
stewart
is
all
of
the
present
state
of
mississippi,
was
that
all
west
florida?
justice
potter
stewart
any
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
gulf
coast
of
mississippi
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
it
was
in
the
louisiana
purchase
of,
what
is
today,
mississippi?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
we
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
just
say
--
did
it
just
say
westwardly,
or
did
it
say
westwardly
along
the
gulf?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
--
where
is
pass
christian
on
that?
it's
not
in
our

justice
potter
stewart
pass
christian

over
by
the
(inaudible)
water.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
enabling
act?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
one
of
your
claims
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
that's
mobile
bay,
isn't
it,
that
--
that
big
body
of
water
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
about
in
the
center
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
draw
it
from
headland
to
headland,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
how
--
how
wide
is
the
--
is
the
whole
water,
gulf
water
of
alabama
there.
it's
tantamount
too
much,
doesn't
it,
in
mileage
compared
to
the
other
gulf
states.
justice
potter
stewart
a
big
part,
which
is
mobile
bay?
justice
potter
stewart
i
could've
been
wrong
of
disappearing
islands.
it
is
going
to
show
up
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
am
a
little
mixed
up
from
my
history.
was
alabama
acquired
through
louisiana
purchase
or
was
it
acquired
by
cession
from
spain?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
louisiana
purchase.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
didn't
come
to
that
as
part
of
west
florida?
justice
potter
stewart
it
did.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
a
(inaudible)
also
don't
you,
in
connection
with
the
rather
extravagant
claims
with
retention
(inaudible)
spain,
in
which
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
tried
to
report
by
various
spanish
treaties.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
extent
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
at
some
length,
you
had
concededly
–
your
argument
is
that
–
your
additional
argument
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
your
argument
is
--
you
are
making
an
additional
argument
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
west
florida
when
it
came
--
the
alabama
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
reason
for
my
question
to
the
solicitor
general
is
how
--
how
alabama
came
to
country
whether
it
was
under
the
louisiana
purchase
or
cession
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
spain
was
to
found
out
whether
it
shared
your
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
from
that
point
north.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
necessary
to
your
argument
senator
to
a
show
us
that
the
boundaries,
prior
to
the
1868
constitution,
were
at
least
as
extensive
as
contained
in
--
in
that
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
words
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
wanted
--
what
is
necessary
as
for
you
to
show
that
these
boundaries
were
approved
by
the
congress?
justice
potter
stewart
senator
holland,
did
this
controversy
or
any
controversy
occur
after
1868
between
florida
and
georgia
as
to
territory?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so
is
settled
for
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
took,
and
--
and
that
--
what
congress
approved
was
this
very
boundary
contained
in
the
1868?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
between
the
two
states.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
tate
did
not
address
himself
of
course
to
the
precise
language
of
the
bill,
he
has
enacted
it.
justice
potter
stewart
s-i-g-h-t?
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
those
two
--
two
prior,
i
think
aborted
attempts
at
forming
florida
constitution
just
prior
to
this
constitution,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
that
much
history.
justice
potter
stewart
each
of
which
expanded
the
prior
values
of
florida.

were
all
purported
