mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
going
to
continue
the
argument
made
by
judge
hart
and
mr.
dougherty
on
the
grounds
that
are
common
or
joint
to
all
of
the
defendant
states
in
this
matter.
my
argument
is
confined
to
two
points.
number
one,
that
geographically
and
historically,
the
gulf
of
mexico
presents
a
special
situation
in
which
a
three-league
boundary
has
been
recognized
and
established
for
all
of
the
gulf
states.
and
the
second
is
that
congress
has
the
power
to
recognize
and
establish
the
coastal
boundaries
of
the
states
irrespective
of
conflicting
theories
of
international
law
and
prior
practice.
and
congress
did
thus
just
that
in
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
exercised
that
power
in
favor
of
the
contentions
made
here
by
the
gulf
states.
this
covers
pages
88
to
145
of
our
joint
brief.
some
references
had
been
made
to
portions
of
that
brief
previously
and
i'm
going
to
--
of
course,
with
167
pages
to
cover
in
30
minutes,
that's
--
that's
--
and
i
can't
go
through
in
its
entirety,
i'll
more
less
going
to
hit
the
high
points.
as
far
as
the
geographic
situation
that
was
faced
by
the
congress
when
it
adopted
the
submerged
lands
act.
any
well-scaled
map
of
the
north
american
continent
will
show
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
landlocked
except
from
the
florida
strait
in
the
western
extremity,
florida
strait
is
right
here
in
the
western
extremity
between
the
peninsula
of
san
antonio
and
yucatan.
this
water
body
is
exactly
what
its
name
connotes,
namely
to
track
the
water
extending
from
the
ocean
or
a
sea
into
an
indentation
of
the
coastline
of
a
country.
soundings
appear
on
both
of
the
early
and
recent
maps
of
the
area,
which
show
the
shoalness
of
the
waters
from
many
miles
seaward
from
inland.
the
shoalness
of
the
waters
is
particularly
reflected
as
early
as
1705
when
the
geographer
for
the
(inaudible)
of
france
prepared
a
--
a
map.
and
of
course,
this
was
after
the
discovery
of
la
salle
in
1682
and
after
the
taking
of
the
possession
of
the
louisiana
territory
by
the
iberville
in
1698
and
1699.
this
map
is
attached
to
all
the
map
appendix,
the
map's
i'm
referring
to
map
appendix
5.
and
that
map
shows
and
says
and
gives
a
warning
to
vessels
not
to
approach
nearer
the
coast
than
the
sounding
points
indicated
at
considerable
distances
from
the
mainland,
all
of
which
we
submit,
are
greater
than
three
leagues
in
the
gulf.
now,
the
chart
which
i
have
here
which
is
1007
of
the
--
the
coast
in
geodetic
survey,
we
use
this
argument
--
we
used
this
map
rather
when
we
argue
this
case
on
april
the
8th,
1957.
as
you
can
note,
your
honors,
that
shows
that
the
distance
between
florida
and
cuba
is
100
miles
and
the
distance
between
cuba
and
newfoundland,
130.
it's
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
more
enclosed
sea,
short
of
the
one
that
is
completely
landlocked.
another
example
of
that
is
a
map
that
we
have
of
north
america
which
is
attached
to
our
map
index,
map
4
which
not
only
shows
the
gulf
of
mexico,
but
which
also
shows
the
hudson
bay.
and
hudson
bay,
just
by
a
simple
analysis
of
the
measurements
on
that
map
is
practically
the
same
as
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
only
difference
being
that
as
far
as
proprietorship
is
concerned,
hudson
bay
is
owned
in
its
entirety
by
the
british
government.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
it's
the
right
over
there,
your
honor
--
mr.

we

(ph)
wrote

he
said

and
on

president
jefferson
sent
a
message
to
congress
in
which
he
pointed
out
the
difficulties
of
fortifying
law
jurors
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
between
the
(inaudible)
of
louisiana
which
is
right

and

all
of
these
physical
facts
can
be
seen
more
clearly
on
original
scale
charts
in
the
map
appendix
which
was
already
submitted
to
the
court,
such
as
a
--

coast
and
geodetic
survey
1115
and
1116,
which
was
made
a
part
of
our
map
appendix
and
also
submitted
with
mississippi's
brief.
congress
clearly
recognized
this
special
situation,
regional
in
character
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
when
it
adopted
the
submerged
lands
act.
i
think
one
of
the
most
--
one
of
the
strongest
points
that
we
could
argue
in
that
matter
would
be
a
quotation
which
occurred
from
the
hearing
of
senate
joint
resolution
13
by
senator
anderson
who
is
an
opponent
of
the
bill.
this
is
found
in
our
joint
reply
brief,
a
little
small
green
brief
--
brief
on
pages
24
and
25.
and
he
said
at
the
hearing
first,
“i
think
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
somewhat
different
than
the
open
sea
off
the
atlantic
and
pacific.
therefore,
i
want
to
put
in
the
limitation
there.
i
am
just
trying
to
make
this
explicit
that
they
could
not
possibly
exceed
more
than
three
leagues
on
the
gulf
and
three
miles
on
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific.”
and
in
the
debate
on
the
senate,
he
made
it
farther
clear
when
he
said
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
might
properly
be
considered
as
being
somewhat
of
a
different
category.
further,
mr.
tate
of
the
department
of
state,
said
on
page
1076
of
the
hearings
before
the
senate
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
presented
an
exceptional
situation
that
required
special
dealings.
of
course,
congress
had
the
situation
of
florida
in
mind
when
it
considered
the
submerged
lands
act
because
here
in
florida
with
three
miles
from
coast
on
its
eastern
coast
and
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
at
that
particular
time,
as
i
understand
the
reading
of
the
hearings,
there
were
some
considerations
given
to
the
fact
that
maybe
the
state
department
might
be
embarrassed
by
a
three-league
limitation
in
the
gulf.
but
that
was
clearly
brought
out
by
the
recognitions
of
the
state
department
that
the
gulf
was
a
special
situation.
and
by
the
statement
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill
in
view
of
the
presidential
proclamation
of
1945
and
in
view
of
the
recognitions
by
the
state
department
there,
that
this
was
a
entirely
domestic
map
and
was
one
which
had
been,
more
or
less
that
the
truman
proclamation
had
more
or
less,
been
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
the
earlier
cases
in
which
this
court
recognized
louisiana's
possession,
the
27
miles
in
texas'
possession
to
the
continental
shelf.
it
said
that
that
emphasizes
the
paramount
right
claims.
and
so,
when
congress
had
that
before
it,
it
simply
said
this,
that
we
have
the
proprietary
rights,
the
united
states
does.
and
so,
when
we
are
considering
the
submerged
lands
act,
it
has
been
recognized
by
the
department
of
state
that
this
is
no
--
there
is
no
conflict
here.
therefore,
this
is
an
entirely
domestic
matter.
we
are
dealing
with
property
rights,
the
authority
of
which
congress
has
a
sole
jurisdiction
to
grant.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
it
would
not
be
confronted
with
that
particular
policy
because
the
truman
proclamation
had
already
been
in
existence,
the
decision
of
this
court
recognizing
the
proprietary
rights,
it
already
been
existence.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
--
and
that
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
right.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
right.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
right.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
anderson
originally
--
anderson
originally
requested
that
it
be
limited
to
three
miles
everywhere.
then,
he
recognized
in
congress
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
that
the
gulf
was
a
special
situation
and
he
wanted
to
limit
it,
exclusive
it
to
three
leagues.and
then
senator
holland
came
along
prior
to
the
vote
on
the
bill,
prior
to
the
time
that
the
bill
was
enacted
into
law.
and
i
had
his
very
words
here
in
which
he
says
this,
“by
the
definition
of
lands
beneath
navigable
waters,
senate
joint
resolution
13
recognizes
that
area
within
the
three-mile
limit
or
within
such
greater
distance
as
a
state's
seaward
boundary,
existed
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
any
of
the
great
lakes
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
--
is
here
--
heretofore
approved
by
congress,
is
within
the
territory
of
the
states
and
the
united
states.”
this
assertion
of
congressional
policy
will
confirm
the
fact
that
such
an
area
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
therefore,
it
is
subject
to
legislation
by
congress.
i
would
like
to
further
point
out
that
that
--
on
that
particular
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
congress
again
recognized
that
and
restated
it
when
it
enacted
into
law
section
6.
the
united
states
retains
all
the
navigational
servitudes
so
forth
and
rights
in
and
power
and
regulation
and
control
of
lands
in
navigable
waters
for
the
constitution
of
purpose
of
commerce,
navigation,
national
defense
and
international
affairs.
so
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
that,
it
was
removed
from
that
portion
of
the
submerged
lands
act
itself,
then
we
go
a
little
farther.
and
we
have
as
further
proof
of
that,
another
act
of
congress,
the
ocs
act
in
which
congress
in
section
4
says
this.
and
the
ocs
act
as
your
honors
well
know,
“brings
the
authority
of
the
united
states
government
to
extract
the
natural
resources
from
whatever
boundary
the
state
has
in
the
gulf
to
the
edge
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
louisiana
from
where
this
black
line
isn't
exactly
the
254
to
where
the
red
line
is,
the
outer
continental
shelf.
so
therefore,
they
say
only
two
people
can
take
these
resources
from
the
subsoil.
and
that's
either
the
state
or
the
federal
government
and
section
4
of
the
ocs
act
says,
“the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
are
extended
to
the
subsoil.
it
didn't
open
above
territorial
waters.
to
the
subsoil
and
seabed
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
to
all
artificial
lands
and
so
forth
for
development
and
moving
to
the
same
extent
as
if
the
outer
continental
shelf
were
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
located
within
a
state.
so,
i
think
that
that
made
the
matter
very,
very
clear.
i
also
think
that
it
made
it
very
domestic
as
was
set
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
by
the
gentleman
that
sponsored
the
passage
of
it
and
of
course,
as
you
know,
the
act
that
was
passed
undoubtedly,
i
think
the
government
even
conceived
that.
and
also,
in
face
of
the
fact
that
there
were
four
amendments
in
the
senate
in
which
they
attempted
to
limit
everyone
three
miles
and
to
say
so
exclusively
that
was
an
amendment
by
anderson,
by
senator
madison,
by
senator
monroney
and
by
representative
yates
in
the
house
and
all
of
those
who
are
conclusively
defeated.
and
inserted
in
the
act
was
a
specific
turn
not
more
than
three
marine
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and
where
did
that
come
from?
that
came
from
every
historic
act
of
possession
and
control
and
dominion
in
the
gulf,
acts
of
which
i
would
like
to
tell
you
about
in
just
one
second.
but
one
of
which,
the
united
states
is
a
party
to,
has
been
a
party
to,
is
still
a
party
to
and
continues
to
recognize.
and
that
is
the
international
boundary
commission
opposite
our
brief
in
page
102,
reproduced.
here
is
the
wording,
“international
boundary
begins
three
leagues
--
begins
three
leagues
from
land
and
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande.”
and
then
it
marks
off
to
make
sure
what
league
is,
it
says
one
marine
league.
so,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
congress
was
deliberate.
congress
was
positive
when
it
put
those
clauses
into
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
ocs
act.
it
took
all
of
those
historical
facts
into
consideration.
it
considered
the
16
special
acts
of
congress.
the
12
treaties
in
the
conventions
and
the
presidential
proclamation,
the
boundary
map,
all
of
which
were
referring
to
boundaries
in
excess
of
three
miles
seaward.
i
have
those,
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
them,
they're
all
in
our
joint
brief
at
the
pages
that
i
referred
your
honors
to.
i'm
going
to
briefly
run
across
some
of
the
history
because
that
is
the
next
portion
of
the
argument
assigned
to
me.
congress
therefore,
was
not
being
frivolous
in
recognizing
boundaries
in
the
gulf
in
excess
of
three
miles.congress
treated
the
gulf
as
a
special
situation
by
reason
of
the
prior
established
boundaries
of
three
leagues
which
i
mentioned.
in
so
doing,
it
adhered
to
its
policy
of
treating
uniformly
and
consistently,
all
coastal
states
of
this
union
from
a
regional
standpoint,
those
bothering
on
the
gulf,
those
on
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
and
those
in
the
great
lakes,
because
as
your
honors
--
as
mr.
justice's
well
know,
in
the
great
lakes
is
that
the
boundary
would
be
to
the
international
boundary
line.
prior
to
the
original
13
colonies,
spain,
france
and
great
britain
maintained
dominion
and
control
over
the
submerged
lands
in
the
gulf.
la
salle
issued
his
proclamation
in
1682.
he
took
possession
of
all
of
the
area
south
of
the
mississippi
river.
he
didn't
take
possession
just
at
the
mississippi
river,
it
went
on.
and
it
included
all
of
the
seas,
the
harbors,
the
ports
and
adjacent
straits
in
the
sea
or
gulf
of
mexico.
when
france
ceded
this
land
and
water
territory
into
spain
in
1762,
france
ceded
everything,
except
all
that
it
claimed.
as
spain
likewise
continued
to
maintain
that
--
the
same
claims.
france,
as
i
have
mentioned
previously,
not
only
claimed
under
la
salle's
proclamation,
but
according
to
the
procession
asserted
by
the
iberville.
spain
ceded
the
florida,
south
and
east
of
the
mississippi
river
to
great
britain
in
1763.
and
shortly
thereafter,
king
george
made
his
proclamation
which
said
that
the
seaward
boundaries
of
east
and
west
florida
which
is
now
opposite
mississippi,
alabama
and
florida,
he
said,
“including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
coast.”
then,
in
1783,
great
britain
ceded
all.
and
i
mentioned
that
word
purposely
that
she
had
to
spain.
and
when
spain
came
along
and
retroceded
the
louisiana
territory
to
france,
it
was
again
described
as
the
same
area
which
it
had
previously
received
from
france
and
spain.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
--
i
don't
quite
follow
your
question,
but
giving
it
the
--
the
imports
that
i
agree,
that
--
that
i
understand,
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
question
here,
that
the
question
of
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea
is
immaterial.
i'm
only
trying
to
show
to
your
honors
that
that
--
for
instance,
that
clause
at
last
sentence
of
section
4
of
the
act,
that
wasn't
put
there
in
the
congress
haphazardly,
it
means
something
because
the
court,
in
my
humble
opinion,
has
to
construe
the
whole
act.
and
when
it
says
prior
to,
i
mean
that
it
has
to
consider
all,
and
that
congress
consider
in
passing
this
act,
all
of
the
historical
acts
of
possession
exercised
by
these
former
territories
which
led
up
to
the
use
of
the
word
“league”
as
a
measurement
in
the
sea
because
france
and
spain
always
used
the
term
“league”.
and
that
is
terrifically
important,
if
your
honor
please,
when
it
comes
to
louisiana,
mississippi,
alabama
and
florida,
because
our
enabling
acts
in
each
case
which
were
passed
in
louisiana
some
eight
years
before,
in
mississippi
a
year
and
a
half,
alabama,
the
same
thing,
florida,
quite
some
while
before
--
those
enabling
acts
all
said
that
it
will
be
having
a
perimeter
barrier
and
that
will
include
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast.
in
the
case
of
louisiana,
three
leagues
from
land,
in
the
case
of
florida
and
six
leagues
from
shore
in
the
case
of
mississippi
and
alabama.
and
i'd
like
to
point
this
out
to
your
honors,
that
when
start
off
by
three
leagues
from
louisiana
then
out
the
mississippi,
just
out
in
order
to
make
it
uniform,
exactly
these
six
leagues
from
shore
in
the
case
of
alabama
and
mississippi.
so,
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
when
it
admitted
these
territories,
it
tried
to
establish
a
uniform
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and
it
almost
certainly
did
as
near
as
could
be
done
at
that
particular
time.
because
then,
we
weren't
worried
about
oil
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
only
thing
we
were
fighting
about
then
was
land
and
what
the
inhabitants
would
receive.
and
when
they
said
all
islands,
if
there
were
people
on
those
islands,
our
country,
the
united
states
growing
with
migration,
wanted
the
possession
of
all
of
those
lands
and
the
possession
of
the
intervening
waters.
the
fact
which
the
government
now
concedes
as
far
as
mississippi,
alabama
and
louisiana
are
concerned,
is
something
which
was
not
conceded
when
we
argued
this
case
on
april
the
8th.
so,
coming
to
the
answer
of
your
question,
no.
when
--
when
--
and
i
don't
disagree
with
your
decision
in
california,
texas
and
louisiana.
i
--
i'm
not
even
intimate
to
that.
but
i
am
saying
this,
that
to
determine
what
our
boundary
was
prior
to
or
at
the
time
we
were
admitted
to
the
union,
we
are
granted
the
right
and
this
was
shown
by
the
debates
and
the
history
of
the
act.
we
are
granted
the
right
to
show
this
court
our
historical
acts
of
possession.
what
--
what
the
territory
of
orleans
consisted
of
and
what
it
consisted
of
at
that
particular
time.
in
other
words,
the
wording
as
--
as
it
comes
to
the
particular
act
as
they
existed
at
that
time,
because
there
were
many
physical
matters
that
came
into
being
to
form
as
they
existed
at
that
particular
time.
you
take
for
example
the
treaty
with
spain
in
1819.
john
quincy
adams
told
spain,
“we
reserved
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
sabine
right
here.
we
want
the
--
we
want
the
shore
on
the
east,
you
can
have
the
shore
to
the
west,
but
we
want
all
the
islands.”
and
spain
bulked
a
little
bit.
spanish
minister
was
de
onis.
and
john
quincy
adams
says,
“no.”
he
says,
“my
offer
to
you
is
withdrawing.
it
is
no
longer
obligatory
on
this
government.”
later,
the
treaty
with
spain
was
concluded
in
1918.
and
what
did
it
state
then
--
say
then?
it
said,
“from
the
mouth
of
the
river
sabine
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
the
sea.”
that
was
the
--
at
that
time
that
was
the
southwest
boundary
of
the
united
states.
and
when
texas
came
along
in
1836,
and
defined
its
boundary
as
from
the
sabine
river,
three
leagues
from
land,
it
necessarily
became
the
southeastern
boundary
of
the
republic
of
texas.
so,
where
did
that
come
from?
where
did
that
history
originate?
it
originated
from
the
--
spain,
france
--
i
mean,
france,
spain,
france
again,
from
the
territory
of
orleans,
our
act
of
admission,
our
enabling
act,
louisiana's
act
of
admission,
the
act
of
--
the
same
of
mississippi,
the
same
of
alabama,
the
same
of
florida,
the
same
of
the
republic
of
texas
and
it
was
recognized
as
an
international
boundary
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
because
i
see
you
picking
up
your
books
and
it's
getting
close
to
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
4:30
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
and
i've
only
covered
one
portion
of
my
argument.[laughter]
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
it
--
no.
it
is
my
contention
that
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
alabama
can
only
claim
three
leagues
from
our
coast.
but
when
--
i
say
this,
that
when
the
enabling
act
of
alabama
and
mississippi
was
passed,
that
they
were
talking
about
the
land
around
biloxi,
the
gulfport
and
mobile.
when
they
said
six
leagues
from
shore,
they
meant
18
miles
into
the
gulf
of
mexico,
pass
ship
by
--
of
horn
island
and
all
those
particular
areas.
that's
my
contention
insofar
as
little
states
were
concerned
and
that
congress,
three
leagues
from
coast
all
out
at
three
leagues
in
coast
i
assume,
practically
even
off
the
(inaudible)
island
with
similar
distance
from
horn,
cat
and
ship
island.
does
that
answer
your
--
how
many
minutes
do
--
do
i
have,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
can't
very
well
cover
the
remaining
portion
of
my
argument
in
that
time,
so
i'll
come
to
pages
142,
143
and
144
of
the
joint
brief
and
call
the
court's
attention
to
that
and
to
assert
submerged
lands
act
as
enacted
with
the
approval
--
with
the
approval
of
the
president.
that
was
intended
to
settle
this
policy
matter.
and
that
settlement
should
be
allowed
to
stand
because
the
plain
purpose
of
congress
should
not
be
thwarted
because
other
solutions
or
alternative
means
of
settling
these
matters
were
available.
the
very
self
--
same
argument
made
to
the
solicitor
general
to
this
court
to
date
was
made
in
congress
and
congress
rejected
it.
it
rejected
it
in
favor
of
a
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
because
only
the
united
states,
only
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can
fix
a
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
anywhere.
only
the
congress
has
that
authority.
and
congress
acted
pursuant
to
its
authority
and
no
further
argument
is
needed
that
the
congress
and
the
president
had
made
it
clear
as
i
said
previously
that
no
one
but
the
united
states
and
the
several
states
composing
it,
can
take
the
minerals
of
our
continental
shelf.
and
it
remains
a
domestic
question.
senator
cordon
stated
this
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
act.
and
i
say
that
if
this
--
this
disposition
must
be
made,
if
--
if
the
court
comes
to
this
question
that
if
it
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
a
territorial
boundary,
then
logic,
sense
and
the
proper
application
of
the
recognized
rules
of
statutory
construction
requires
that
the
submerged
lands
act
be
considered
as
declaring
the
extent
of
the
national
territory.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
a
national
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
it
has
to
be
three
leagues
from
coast
because
that
power
is
congress'
power
and
it
had
affected
that
boundary
by
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
i
submit
that
all
that's
needed
to
give
so
simple
and
reasonable
proposition
is
to
construe
the
submerged
lands
act
and
its
(inaudible),
the
ocs
act
in
the
proper
light
and
in
the
effect
intended
by
congress.
and
on
that
point
and
i
say
again,
furthermore,
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
the
united
states
now
has
a
national
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
three
leagues
from
coast
as
established
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
in
1848
and
ratified
by
the
gadsden
treaty
several
years
later.
i
thank
your
honors.
