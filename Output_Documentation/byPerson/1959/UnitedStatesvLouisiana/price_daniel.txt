mr.
price
daniel
that
--
that
brings
us
to
the
second
part
of
our
argument
which
is
--
which
is
congressional
intent
of
senator
--
governor
daniel
who
was
then
a
senator
in
response
to
this
act.
he's
going
to
argue
and
cover
that
part
of
the
case.
and
i'll
ask
him
to
reply
to
your
question
as
he
develops
his
case.
mr.
price
daniel
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
assure
you
that
our
credibility
as
a
lawyer
and
not
as
co-sponsor
of
this
legislation
nor
as
a
witness.
and
i
shall
accord
to
the
record
only
in
what
i
present
to
the
court.
i
shall
refer
only
to
the
case
of
texas
and
to
the
intent
of
congress
with
respect
to
texas
and
its
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
you
will
see
from
the
record,
which
will
be
cited,
that
congress
did,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
have
the
very
issue
of
how
far
this
grant
should
go
as
to
texas
and
did
decide
the
issue
because
it
was
joined
in
the
congress
on
four
different
occasions.
the
best
evidence,
of
course,
of
the
intent
of
the
--
sir.
mr.
price
daniel
the
issue
was
joined.
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
on
four
different
occasions,
on
the
floor
--
three
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
one
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
the
best
evidence,
of
course,
in
the
intent
and
effect
of
the
act
are
--
is
the
wording
of
the
act
itself
that
congress
had
intended
to
limit
texas
three
miles
and
all
the
states
it
would
have
stopped
at
the
words
--
after
the
words
“three
geographical
miles
distance
from
the
coast
line
of
each
state.”
but
it
did
not
so
intend
and
it
did
not
so
stop.
it
went
further
and
said
that
the
grant
should
extend
beyond
three
miles
in
a
case
in
such
cases
where
a
state's
boundary,
not
at
the
time,
but
as
it
existed
at
the
time
it
entered
the
union,
it
extended
beyond
three
miles
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
not
to
exceed
three
leagues.
now,
the
record
cited
in
our
separate
briefs
show
that
those
terms
were
written
into
the
act
by
congress
and
recommended
by
president
who
understood
the
facts
and
the
history
related
here
by
attorney
general
wilson
who
understood
that
president
polk
had
promised
sam
houston
who,
although
not
president,
the
record
show
that
annexation
depended
on
his
support.
and
there
is
cited
here
by
the
solicitor
general
a
letter
saying
by
the
u.s.
representative
that
“i
left
sam
houston
believing
he
would
not
deport
annexation.”
that
was
in
march,
i
believe.
polk,
he
told
him
to
travel.
they
want
us
to
be
sure
and
guaranteed
to
support
the
boundary
set
up
by
the
republic.
and
president
polk
wrote
in
june
saying,
promising
houston,
as
you
see
here
on
our
brief
from
the
letter
of
the
attorney
general
as
quoted
that
“i
will
support
these
boundaries.”
mr.
price
daniel
38,
i
believe.
i'll
check
on
it.
no,
that's
not
the
one.
you'll
find
--
i
--
i'll
get
it
for
you
in
just
a
minute.
now,
all
that
was
before
the
congress
and
before
the
committees.
and
so,
regardless
of
what
my
--
be
shown
as
to
other
states,
this
matter
what
boundary
was
intended
by
these
wordings,
it
words
in
the
act
of
the
texas
or
certainly,
pointed
out
to
the
committees
and
to
the
congress.
that's
on
page
98,
mr.
justice
black,
where
the
polk's
letter
is
cited
to
sam
houston.
and
i
call
your
attention
to
the
facts
that
after
that
sam
houston
did
support
annexation,
as
stated,
the
best
evidence
of
this
intent
of
the
wording
of
this
act
is
the
intent,
is
the
wording
itself
together
with
the
fact,
the
undisputed
fact
before
the
congress
that
texas
boundary
did
exist
at
the
time
it
entered
the
union
at
three
leagues.
it
was
so
provided
in
the
laws
of
texas
both
prior
to
and
at
the
time
of
annexation.
the
next
best
evidence,
of
course,
confirming
such
intention
of
congress
at
texas,
we
find
in
the
committee
reports,
this
court
has
held
that
reports
of
the
committees
of
congress
are
the
most
reliable
evidence
of
congressional
intent
outside
the
terms
of
the
act
itself.
i
hold
here,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
two
committee
reports,
one
from
the
senate,
one
from
the
house
on
the
intended
effect
of
this
bill.
both
reports
describe
the
grant
as
extending
not
the
present
boundaries,
not
the
national
maritime
boundaries
or
national
boundaries
except
the
great
lakes
or
to
territorial
water
boundaries,
but
to
historic
boundaries
of
the
respective
states.
both
reports
refer
to
the
three-league
boundary
of
texas
as
the
extent
of
the
grant
of
texas
under
the
language
used
and
decided.
the
senate
report
--
mr.
price
daniel
i
am
coming
to
that
sir.
page
7
of
the
report
--
now,
the
senate
report.
at
page
7,
right
about
the
middle
of
the
page
is
a
table
showing
the
total
acreage
that
would
be
conveyed
to
the
states
within
these
traditional
historic
state
boundaries.
and
then
it
refers
to
appendix
f
which
you
will
find
on
page
76,
and
in
that
appendix,
in
the
committee
report
is
the
acreage
figured
for
the
state
of
texas
as
2,444,000
acres.
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
appendix
--
of
this
appendix
f,
you
will
find
the
language
which
includes
these
words,
“original
--
only
original
state
boundaries
have
been
used.”
this
is
on
page
76.
mr.
price
daniel
do
you
have
report
133
of
the
senate
--
mr.
price
daniel
part
2,
well
that's
minority
report.
mr.
price
daniel
yes,
sir.
i've
read
it
from
the
majority
report.
mr.
justice,
in
order
to
save
time
may
i
read
it
so
you
--
mr.
price
daniel
well,
i
--
i'll
leave
mine
with
you.
here's
what
it
says,
“that
original
--
only
original
state
boundaries
have
been
used.
these
coincide
with
the
three-mile
limit
for
all
states
except
texas,
louisiana
and
florida
gulf
coast.
in
the
latter
cases,
the
three-league
limit,”
and
this
is
important
wording
in
this
committee
report,
it
appears
to
me,
“in
the
latter
cases,
the
three-league
limit,
as
established
before
at
the
time
of
entry
into
the
union,
has
been
used.”
now,
here's
a
house
committee
report.
on
page
57,
you'll
find
the
same
table
only
expressed
in
square
--
in
--
in
square
miles
instead
of
acres.
these
acres
--
mr.
price
daniel
page
57
of
the
house
committee
report
on
h.
r.
4198,
which
is
the
same
bill,
that
is
title
ii,
i
believe,
that
was
passed.
page
57.
it's
the
same
table
except
that
as
for
--
that
is
expressed
in
square
mile
instead
of
acreage.
the
solicitor
general
will
not
dispute
that
the
acres
figured
here
and
the
square
miles
figured
here
in
this
committee
report
are
exactly
what's
within
three
leagues
from
shore
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
if
it
is
three
miles,
it'd
only
be
one-third
that
much.
now,
the
solicitor
general
--
indeed
the
committee's
table,
as
i
have
said,
specifically
set
that
out
that
they
did
use
the
three-league
measuring
in
figuring
this
acreage.
mr.
price
daniel
now,
back
--
sir.
mr.
price
daniel
the
reports
refer
to
those
tables
as
--
you
see
they
total
up
--
both
reports,
the
total
acreage
given
to
the
states
within
the
historic
boundaries
and
the
total
acreage
that'll
be
out
on
the
outer
shelf.
mr.
price
daniel
well,
that
certainly
is
in
conclusion
that
i
draw
from
it.
it's
certainly
evidenced
that
that's
what
the
--
mr.
price
daniel
oh,
yes.
and
i
--
mr.
price
daniel
well,
in
figuring
the
acreage
covered
by
the
bill,
that's
just
what
they
do.
now,
then,
coming
back
to
the
senate
committee
report,
in
the
senate
committee
report,
on
page
65
in
appendix
e,
you
will
find
a
statement
which
read
as
follows.
“texas
boundary
was
fixed
at
three
marine
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
the
time
it
was
admitted
into
the
union
in
1845
by
the
annexation
agreement.”
now,
the
same
--
the
same
language
appears
over
here
in
the
house
committee
report
on
a
different
page,
page
43,
“the
texas
boundary
was
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
the
time
it
was
admitted
to
the
union.”
so
clearly,
this
is
evidence
of
what
boundary
these
two
committees
were
talking
about
when
they
used
the
word
“as
they
existed
at
the
time
they
were
entered
--
entered
into
the
union”.
mr.
price
daniel
yes,
sir,
you
read
the
--
the
congressional
debates
especially
the
attempt
to
change
the
act
and
to
provide
amendments
for
three
miles
for
all
the
states.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
issue
was
met
head
on
the
floor
protects,
it
not
just
gives
the
chance
to
go
to
court,
it
is
met
head
on.
texas
entitled
this
because
the
president
of
the
united
states
promised
to
defend
this
boundary.
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
texas
case
did
not
dispute
those
boundaries.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
cited
the
boundaries
out
three
leagues
and
said,
“we
assume
that
texas,
as
a
republic,
had
all
of
the
land
within
this
marginal
bill
but
we
hold
that
the
property
rights
and
all
the
political
rights
passed
to
the
united
states.”
now,
it
was
that
same
three
leagues
of
land
that
this
court
held
passed
by
admission
to
the
united
states
that
congress
was
restoring
to
the
state
of
texas
or
was
granting.
we
--
we
certainly
do
not
contest
with
what
it
was
granting
texas
on
the
basis
that
we
did
in
good
faith
for
over
100
years
thought
that
we
owned
it.
mr.
price
daniel
sir,
the
only
thing
i
have
to
stand
on
right
here
is
that
all
senators
did
not
say
it
and
that
the
wrong
impression
had
been
left
to
this
court
with
your
respected
solicitor
general
as
to
what
was
said
in
that
connection.
and
we
have
here,
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
we've
gone
into
all
of
the
congressional
records
and
hearings.
we've
compiled
a
table
here
of
just
what
they
did
say
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
in
the
committees
about
these
three-league
boundary.
and
that's
on
page
235
of
the
texas
brief,
the
big
yellow
brief.
now,
of
course,
you
don't
have
time
to
--
to
go
and
read
all
these
records.
i
simply
ask
the
court
this.
that
in
anything
said
by
the
solicitor
general
about
what
was
said
on
the
floor,
i
simply
ask
that
you
refer
to
this
table.
it
--
it
covers
many
pages.
there
are
93
separate
references
of
the
three-league
for
10.5
miles
for
texas
as
being
the
effect
of
this
act
or
--
or
in
connection
with
the
act.
and
i
think
that
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
solicitor
general
has
not
fairly
stated
the
matter
as
to
what
was
said
on
the
floor.
for
instance,
he
used
senator
cordon's
statement
a
moment
ago
in
showing
that
it's
just
a
matter
to
be
left
out
to
the
court
and
that
he
had
some
doubt
about
it.
also,
he
cited
a
statement
from
then
--
then
senator
daniel.
and
on
page
37
of
our
brief,
let
me
read
the
--
the
statements
exactly
as
they
were.
mr.
douglas,
page
37
of
texas
brief,
“i
should
like
to
ask
specifically
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
distinguished
senator
from
oregon
as
to
what
this
provision
does
to
the
boundary
of
texas.
what
does
it
mean
in
the
case
of
texas?”
mr.
cordon,
“the
senator
from
oregon,
is
not
going
to
tempt
the
boundary
of
state
of
texas
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
texas
is
the
boundary
which
was
established
for
the
state
of
texas
when
she
voluntarily
pulled
down
her
own
flag
and
ran
up
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
that
boundary
has
not
changed.”
mr.
daniel,
“it
may
be
that
the
senator
from
illinois
wishes
to
make
certain
that
the
state
of
texas
does
not
claim
that
its
boundary,
at
the
time
of
its
admission,
extended
beyond
three
leagues.”
and
i
--
the
record
shows
that
he
was
assured
that
it
did
not.
then
mr.
douglas
says,
“mr.
president,
does
the
senator
from
oregon,
mr.
cordon,
the
manager's
bill,
agree
with
the
interpretation
of
the
senator
from
texas
and
i've
said
all
about
what
our
boundary
was
and
how
far
it
would
go
under
this
bill.”
mr.
cordon,
“the
senator
from
oregon
is
not
going
either
agree
or
disagree.
the
senator
from
oregon
gives
his
opinion
that
the
argument
seems
to
him
to
be
sound
but
he
is
not
passing
upon
the
question
because
he
does
not
have
the
power
to
pass
on
it.”
then
mr.
cordon,
“with
respect
to
the
three-league
limit,
there
was
the
treaty,
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo.
yes,
the
treat
of
guadalupe-hidalgo,
that
treaty
recognized
the
boundary
line
extending
three
leagues
from
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.”
now,
i
--
i
can't
spend
anymore
time
on
citing
these
but
they
are
compiled
in
our
appendix
here.
and
i
do
refer
the
court
to
it
if
you
have
any
question
as
to
what
was
said
about
this
texas
three-league
boundary
and
the
effect
of
this
bill.
now
--
mr.
price
daniel
i
understand
that
in
our
--
i
hope
--
mr.
price
daniel
i
meant
no
offense
but
the
6000
pages
of
committee
hearings
and
all,
and
that's
why
we're
saying
that
we
had
gone
on
a
great
trouble
to
try
to
extract
these
and
put
them
there
just
for
comparison.
i
certainly
understand
that.
mr.
price
daniel
yes,
sir,
and
you
will
find
both
the
proponents.
there
were
40
co-authors
of
this
bill.
you'll
find
a
statement
on
behalf
of
the
proponents,
senator
holland
to
that
effect,
that
it
will
do
it
and
the
unusual
thing
about
this
bill
in
the
congress
is
that
the
opponent
said
so
to.
that
was
their
main
objection
for
the
bill.
they
wrote
a
letter.
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
wrote
a
letter
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
during
the
27
days
of
debate
right
in
the
midst
of
it,
the
20
main
opponents
of
the
bill
in
which
they
said
this
bill,
as
it's
worthy,
is
going
to
give
texas
submerged
lands
of
10.5
miles
beyond
the
three-mile
belt
of
territorial
waters,
and
said
that's
going
to
interfere
with
foreign
policy.
and
what
do
you
--
we
think
you
ought
to
do
something
about
it.
the
state
department
says
and
the
solicitor
general
says
it
won't
be
a
good
thing.
it
might
be
some
conflict
with
our
foreign
policy.
the
president
of
the
united
states
wrote
back
to
senator
taft,
the
majority
leader,
saying
that
he
had
supported
the
conveyance
of
these
lands
up
to
the
historic
boundaries
and
that
he
supported
the
bill
and
he
specifically
mentioned
texas
three-league
boundary.
and
said
--
and
quoted
a
speech
he
had
previously
made
in
which
he
had
recognized
that
texas,
when
it
entered,
had
three
leagues
and
attempted
to
retain
its
lands
out
to
three
leagues.
that
was
part
of
the
legislative
history.
so
that's
why
i
say
that
in
the
history
of
this
act
as
to
texas,
you
have
it
undisputed.
as
far
now
as
the
committees
and
the
members
of
congress
are
concerned
that
the
wording
of
the
act
would
go
three
leagues.
mr.
price
daniel
well,
i
am
coming
to
that.
mr.
price
daniel
i
am
coming
to
that.
mr.
price
daniel
the
congress
--
mr.
price
daniel
sir,
let
me
--
if
i
may,
i'll
come
to
that.
mr.
price
daniel
yes,
sir,
i
hope
that
i
can
remove
a
little
doubt
before
my
15
minutes
is
up.
the
obvious
fallacy
in
the
government's
argument
is
that
the
moment
--
the
words,
mr.
justice
black,
intended
that
--
to
show
this
are
the
words
“the
boundary
beyond
three
miles
in
a
case
where
they
existed
as
they
existed
at
the
time
a
state
entered
the
union”.
now,
the
solicitor
general
talks
about
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
--
i've
read
you
what
the
committee
reports
say
here,
he
--
he
detracts
from
those
reports
because
they're
into
the
appendices
of
these
committee
reports
but
as
the
committee
report
itself
showed,
they
were
written
by
a
committee
considering
the
same
language,
the
same
bill,
and
they
incorporated
it,
just
like
the
solicitor
general
has
some
appendices
in
his
own
brief,
and
i
would
imagine
he
wants
the
court
to
consider
and
that's
what
the
committee
did
with
these
appendices
from
which
i
read
a
moment
ago.
he
says
“at
the
time”
leaving
off
some
very
important
words
“boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time”.
there
are
two
past
tenses
there,
“existed
at
the
time
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union”.
now,
the
fallacy
in
his
argument
is
this.
he
assumes
that
a
state's
boundaries
are
fixed
at
the
time
the
moment
you
come
in
and
that
you
can
shrink
boundaries.
of
course,
that's
in
order
to
put
in
his
unheard
of
theory
of
boundaries
shrinkage
by
operation
of
the
law,
of
not
by
operation
of
law,
but
by
foreign
policy.
now,
here's
the
fallacy
i
think.
i'll
check
the
admission
of
all
the
states
including
alaska
and
hawaii
and
i
say
to
the
court
that
you
don't
find
where
any
state
has
ever
admitted
to
this
union
without
its
boundaries
being
fixed,
prior
to
the
moment
of
admission
until
the
final
act
of
admission.
the
solicitor
general
has
simply
ignored
the
congressional
practice
which
has
been
followed
through
the
history
of
this
country,
of
letting
the
people
of
a
territory
set
up
its
constitution.
if
it's
a
--
if
it's
a
u.s.
territory,
the
boundaries
are
fixed
usually
in
the
enabling
acts
or
in
the
state
constitution
which
is
written
before
the
state
finally
comes
in.
take
for
instance
here
the
other
day
as
to
the
hawaiian
islands.
congress
passed
the
enabling
acts
saying
what
boundaries
would
be
admitted.
but
it
required
the
people
of
hawaii
to
both,
to
change
their
previous
boundaries
and
set
the
boundaries
that
were
to
come
in
and
did
not
allow
the
present
issue
of
proclamation
of
admission
to
the
union
until
the
people
of
hawaii
had
changed
the
boundary.
the
whole
point
is
simply
this.
that
in
the
practice
of
congress
which
was
certainly
known
to
congress
when
they
wrote
these
words
into
the
act,
it
was
to
allow
--
to
fix
the
boundaries
beforehand,
before
the
final
separate
act
of
admission,
the
moment
of
admission
comes
about.
and
so
clearly,
there
had
to
be
some
boundaries
fixed
and
have
been
in
the
case
of
every
state.
now,
telling
the
solicitor
general
to
show
this
court
when
stated
where
the
boundaries
of
a
prospective
state
were
not
fixed
prior
to
the
moment
that
the
final
act
of
admission
took
the
effect.
certainly,
that
is
the
case
in
texas,
an
independent
nation
at
the
time
that
we
came
in
and
certainly
that
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
to
go
to
those
boundaries
fixed
at
the
time
they
entered.
they
had
to
be
fixed
prior
to
that
time
in
a
constitution
or
in
some
enabling
act
or
something.
now,
that
was
the
interpretation.
that
was
also
stated
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
mr.
senator
anderson
asked
--
senator
anderson
asked,
“why
don't
you
just
put
the
historic
boundaries
and
write
them
into
this
bill.”
he
replies
on
page
51
of
the
texas
brief.
and
i
would
not
quote
it
here
except
that
the
person
making
the
reply
on
the
senate
floor
was
a
co-manager
and
co-sponsor
of
the
bill
and
--
and
gave
exactly
the
reason
the
terms
we
used.
starting
down
on
page
51
about
the
second
paragraph
of
the
quote,
now,
this
is
in
reply
to
mr.
senator
anderson's
question
he's
asked
on
page
50,
“why
not
simply
include
the
term
historic
boundaries
in
the
pending
measures?”
well,
on
51,
the
senator
from
texas,
a
co-manager
of
the
bill
has
said,
“of
course,
texas
boundaries
did
exist
at
three
leagues
at
the
time
of
annexation,
and
the
texas
and
florida
three-league
boundaries
were
heretofore
approve
the
congress
but
that
is
history.
as
the
senator
from
florida
said,
the
intention
was
the
rights
specifically
into
the
joint
resolution
what
the
office
had
said
all
along
would
be
its
effect.
that
it
covered
only
and
within
on
the
historic
boundaries.
the
only
way
i
know
to
describe
the
word
“historic”
by
means
of
definition
is
to
say
as
the
boundaries
existed
when
the
respective
states
entered
the
union
are
heretofore
approved
by
the
congress.
there's
good
reason,
mr.
president
why
those
words
should
be
used.
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
said
in
several
cases
that
the
federal
government
can
do
nothing
to
change
the
area
of
a
state
after
it
has
entered
the
union
with
fixed
boundaries
except
with
the
consent
of
the
state.
there's
another
line
of
cases
which
hold
that
if
the
boundaries
are
set
out
in
the
state
constitution
such
as
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
florida
which
is
approved
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
then
the
united
states
cannot
change
those
boundaries
without
the
consent
of
the
state.
that
is
why
the
terms
“now
impaired”
are
used.
this
would
--
words
mean
nothing
if
they
had
not
been
spoken
on
the
senate
floor
by
a
committee
member
and
by
a
co-manager
and
author
of
the
bill.
that
--
mr.
price
daniel
in
the
report
as
to
--
only
what
i
have
read
here
with
respect
to
texas,
that
i
recall
at
this
time.
they
were
taken
from
court
decisions,
but
i
will
say
this,
mr.
justice
black,
this
was
not
challenged
at
all,
and
you'll
see
in
reading
all
these
excerpt
from
congressional
history
that
it
was
not
challenged.
they
are
as
to
the
--
as
to
what
the
author
has
said
was
the
meaning
of
the
word
why
they
were
used.
they
are
taken
from
court
decisions
which
have
been
written
in
cases.
this
was
still
a
reply
to
senator
anderson
with
situation
similar
to
the
present
one,
and
quoting
still,
for
instance,
in
new
mexico
versus
colorado,
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
right
of
a
state
upon
its
admission
into
the
union
to
rely
upon
its
established
boundary
lines
cannot
be
impaired
by
any
subsequent
action
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.
and
then
--
and
in
new
mexico
versus
texas,
new
mexico,
when
admitted
as
a
state
in
1912,
explicitly
declared
in
its
constitution,
that
was,
of
course,
before
the
final
act
of
admission,
that
its
boundary
ran
alongside
32nd
parallel
to
the
rio
grande.
this
was
confirmed
by
the
united
states
by
admitting
new
mexico
as
a
state
with
the
line
thus
described
as
its
boundary.
now,
that
was
the
reply
as
to
why
use
those
boundaries.
and
you
will
find
that
senator
anderson
later
on
after
that
in
the
excerpts
he
himself
interpreted
this
bill
as
given
to
texas
three
leagues
or
to
some
states
10.5
miles.
you'll
find
a
statement
quoted
here
because
senator
anderson,
it
was
who
offered
the
first
amendment
on
the
senate
floor
to
cut
all
state
back
to
three
miles.
then
the
next
amendment
on
the
senate
floor
was
offered
by
senator
monroney.
and
then
it
cut
all
states
to
three
miles.
and
he
argued,
“texas
is
going
to
get
three
leagues,
it
ought
to
get
it.”
then
the
next
one
was
offered
by
senator
magnuson.
and
he
argued
the
same
thing
and
all
his
amendment
would
have
done,
it
was
the
short
one,
would
have
just
trimmed
everything
back.
it
would
have
stricken
out
all
of
the
171
words
the
solicitor
general
now
asks
this
court
to
strike
out
in
your
decision,
in
the
decision
he
asked
this
court
to
make.
but
the
congress
--
the
senate
of
the
united
states
said,
“no.”
and
here's
the
important
part.
in
this
last
magnuson
amendment,
the
issue
was
drawn
on
what
texas
ought
to
get
how
far
it
ought
to
go
under
all
principles
of
equity
and
justice
and
under
this
boundary
which
was
recognized
by
our
presidents
including
the
president
of
the
united
states
who
had
written
this
letter.
and
president
polk
back
there
at
that
time
and
which
exists
in
our
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo,
as
mr.
justice
black
says
that
treaty,
i
mean
brought
out,
that
treaty
still
in
existence.
if
you
have
to
have
a
national
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
three
leagues
in
order
for
best
to
win
this
lawsuit,
we
certainly
have
it.
that
treaty
is
still
in
existence
and
mr.
jack
tate
of
the
state
department
appeared,
he
was
deputy
legal
adviser
before
our
committee,
not
by
letter
but
so
you
can
examine
it.
and
he
said
specifically
that
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
was
still
in
existence.
the
solicitor
general
quotes
only
three
words
he
said
in
his
reply
brief,
but
here
is
what
he
continued
to
say,
“i
do
think,”
here's
what
mr.
tate
said,
“the
united
states
recognizes
the
treaty
as
setting
the
boundaries
between
texas
and
mexico.
i
do
not
think
the
state
department
has
had
occasion
to
pass
on
the
question
as
to
territorial
waters
claimed
by
the
texas
vis-à-vis
of
the
nation
because
of
guadalupe
hidalgo.”
this
is
very
important
because
there,
you
have
the
state
department's
legal
counsel
sent
by
mr.
douglas
to
the
committee
himself
drawing
a
distinction
between
territorial
waters
and
boundary
and
showing
that
territorial
waters
or
maritime
jurisdiction
can
exist
at
a
lesser
distance
than
boundaries.
the
treaty
only
purports
to
set
boundary
as
between
the
united
states
and
mexico.
we
recognize
that
boundary
has
been
set
by
the
treaty
but
i
think
we
have
not
had
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
the
territorial
waters
by
reason
of
it.
in
other
words,
he
says
the
boundary
is
definite.
but
as
far
as
the
rights
of
the
territorial
waters
on
account
of
our
policy
is
an
unsettled
thing.
we
do
not
agree
with
mexico
on
it
and
--
but
mexico
is
still
claiming
that,
it's
unsettled
but
boundaries,
these
three
leagues
out
the
national
boundary
and
as
general
wilson
said,
it
came
from
the
texas
boundary
act.
now
--
mr.
price
daniel
yes,
sir,
it
is,
but
the
protest
is
only
in
this
language.
it
does
not
protest
the
three-league
boundary.
it
simply
says,
the
united
states
reserved
its
rights
to
use
the
waters
in
accordance
with
its
contention
and
foreign
policy.
it
does
not
protest
the
boundary
for
other
purpose.
now,
i
would
like
to
hurry
on
here
to
say
that
in
the
--
in
our
brief,
we
have
a
whole
section
on
congressional
intent
that
shows
that
these
historic
boundaries
were
all
put
in
the
committee
record
by
the
committee
counsel
with
texas
being
less
than
to
three
leagues.
senator
holland
on
the
floor
used
the
map,
stayed
on
the
floor
for
weeks
as
shown
by
the
record
and
which
texas
has
shown
as
going
three
leagues
under
this
bill.
i
think
the
clearest
evidence
is
the
fact
when
the
issue
was
joined
congress
voted
not
to
limit
to
three
miles.
and
certainly,
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
contemporaneous
construction
by
those
who
administered
the
bill,
the
secretary
of
interior
as
we
show
in
the
brief
all
these
leagues
form
apply
to
three
leagues
to
texas.
he
was
given
the
outer
shelf
to
administer.
all
his
leagues
form
for
four
years,
texas
has
made
nine
separate
lease
sales
by
public
auction
in
this
area
in
four
years.
and
we
don't
have
any
all
out
there
yet
between
three
miles
and
three
leagues,
that's
the
less
i
heard.
but
those
lease
sales
who
were
given
to
the
secretary
of
interior.
he
put
out
a
statement
they
would
not
lease
any
closer
to
shore
than
three
leagues,
that
he
recognized
texas
boundary
of
three
leagues
in
his
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
act
which
he
has
to
write
and
which
eisenhower
administration
(inaudible)
to
the
congress.
and
the
present
case
from
contemporaneous
construction
that
they
signed
the
bill,
that
he
was
glad
to
restore,
i
believe
he
said,
these
lands
to
the
states
in
accordance
with
the
claims
that
they've
made
over
the
years.
and
even
the
year
this
suit
was
filed,
the
president
wrote
the
governor
of
texas
saying,
and
it's
in
our
brief,
“in
further
response
to
your
telegram,
it
is
my
view,”
this
is
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
power
and
the
secretary
of
state,
as
i
understand
it
in
foreign
policy
matters.
“it
is
my
view,
texas
should
have
the
right
to
explore
and
exploit
the
submerged
lands
extending
seaward
of
the
sections
coast
line
for
a
distance
of
three
marine
leagues
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
any
action
that
it
maybe
necessary
for
the
attorney
general
to
take
by
reason
of
the
june
24th
order
of
the
supreme
court.
the
statements
i
have
publicly
made
which
bear
upon
this
controversy
will
be
presented
to
the
court
as
well
as
statements
by
the
attorney
general
which
as
you
know
accorded
with
my
view,”
and
they
did.
i
have
cited
--
we've
cited
in
this
brief
attorney
general
brownell
saying
it
would
go
three
leagues
as
the
texas
secretary
mckay,
“which
you
know
accorded
with
my
own
views,”
i'll
leave
it
to
the
court
as
to
how
vigorously,
the
solicitor
general
has
presented
the
views
of
the
president,
but
i
do
say
that
congress
and
the
president,
the
policy
making
branch
of
our
government
on
matters
of
boundaries
and
domestic
matters
of
this
kind
as
to
the
continental
shelf
have
decided
this
issued
in
favor
of
texas
of
three
leagues
at
the
time.
my
time
is
up,
isn't
it?
is
this
the
end?
mr.
price
daniel
yes,
we
do
in
our
brief
but
--
mr.
price
daniel
we
--
we
don't
need
--
we
can't
stress
everything
--
mr.
price
daniel
we
do
--
mr.
price
daniel
no.
we
do
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
boundaries
of
this
league
at
the
time
we
entered,
we
certainly
rely
on
the
fact
that
congress
approved
them
when
they
took
guadalupe
hidalgo
treaty
and
the
senate
approved
that
going
out
three
leagues.
mr.
price
daniel
thank
you,
sir.
and
then
congress
passed,
and
we
listed,
numerous
bills
and
appropriate
and
money
to
carry
out
the
sabine
with
that
boundary
of
three
leagues
out.
