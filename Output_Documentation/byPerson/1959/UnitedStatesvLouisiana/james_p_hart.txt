mr.
james
p.
hart
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
opening
the
argument
for
the
gulf
states,
i
would
like
to
state
first
our
general
position.
we
submit
that
the
submerged
lands
act
transfers
property
rights
to
all
of
the
gulf
coast
states
to
three
leagues
from
their
coast.
the
government
seeks
to
nullify
what
we
contend
is
two
thirds
of
that
grant
by
implying
a
limitation
to
one
league
or
three
marine
miles.
we
say
that
the
grant
in
the
submerged
lands
act
is
not
subject
to
such
an
implied
limitation
that
the
measure
of
a
transfer
in
the
act
is
the
state's
historic
boundaries
as
defined
in
that
act
and
that
questions
of
foreign
policy
and
international
law
are
irrelevant.
in
the
alternative,
we
say
that
if
international
law
particularly
as
interpreted
by
the
united
states
in
its
foreign
policy,
at
the
relevant
times,
is
to
be
considered
that
the
boundaries
of
the
states
at
the
time
they
became
members
of
the
union
or
as
approved
by
congress,
were
valid
boundaries.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
restrict
my
argument
to
our
primary
contention
which
is
that
the
measure
of
the
grant
in
the
submerged
lands
act
is
the
historic
boundaries
of
the
states.
and
that
matters
of
foreign
policy
and
international
law
by
which
the
government
contends,
a
national
boundary
at
three
miles
was
fixed
or
beside
the
point.
mr.
dougherty
and
attorney
general
gremillion
will
argue
the
application
of
foreign
policy
and
international
law
to
the
boundaries
of
the
states
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
in
presenting
my
argument
that
the
submerged
lands
act
under
which
the
states
claim
the
rights
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
measures
the
grant
by
the
historic
boundaries
of
the
states
as
defined
in
the
statute.
i
would
first
like
to
direct
my
argument
to
the
terms
of
the
act
itself.
the
act
is
copied
a
little
more
fully
or
portions
of
it
on
pages
333
and
following,
of
the
government's
main
brief
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
those
sections
as
set
out
there.
the
title
ii
of
the
act
is
copied
on
page
333
and
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
that
connection
is
that
the
title
shows
that
it
is
an
act
to
confer
property
rights
on
the
states
in
the
submerged
lands,
that
is
beneath
navigable
waters,
within
state
boundaries
and
it
confirms
the
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states,
seaward
of
state
boundaries.
the
granting
clause
in
the
act
is
section
3
which
is
copied
on
page
335
of
the
government's
brief.
that
section
begins
by
saying
that
congress
finds
it
to
be
and
declares
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest
that
title
to
an
ownership
of
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
within
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
states
and
the
national
resources
in
such
lands
and
waters
are
confirmed,
transferred
and
established
to
the
respective
states.
the
court
will
note
that
the
transfer
is
made
on
the
basis
of
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
within
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
states.
and
those
terms
are
defined
in
section
2
which
is
copied
on
page
334
of
the
government's
brief.
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
are
defined
in
that
--
in
subparagraph
(2)
of
paragraph
(a)
of
section
2,
to
mean,
“lands
covered
by
tidal
waters
extending
seaward
to
a
line
three
geographic
miles
distant
from
the
coastline
of
each
such
state.”
i
pause
there
to
remark
that
the
outer
limit
is
a
line
three
geographical
miles
primarily
as
stated
in
that
section
and,
and
this
is
an
additional
grant,
to
another
line.
“that
is
the
boundary
line
of
each
such
state
where
in
any
case,
such
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union.”
and
i
might
say
the
word
is
not
as
it
was
created
or
as
that
became,
but
as
it
existed.
“at
the
time
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
or
as
heretofore
approved
by
congress,
extends
seaward
or
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
beyond
three
geographical
miles.”
the
term
“boundaries”
is
defined
in
paragraph
(d)
of
section
2
in
three
ways.
it
says
that
boundaries
mean
the
seaward
boundaries,
all
the
boundaries
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
in
the
great
lakes,
first,
as
they
existed
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
or
second,
as
heretofore
approved
by
congress,
or
third,
as
extended
or
confirmed
pursuant
to
section
4
hereof.
now,
i'd
like
to
pause
there
to
say
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
section
4
on
the
moment,
but
at
--
at
this
time,
i
want
point
out
that
the
boundaries
defined
or
--
or
boundaries,
historic
boundaries
that
is,
boundaries
which
are
defined
by
historical
facts
as
to
what
boundaries
existed
at
the
time
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
as
approved
by
congress
before
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
no,
sir.
we
--
it
is
not
used
in
the
act.
it
is
a
term
that
was
used
by
the
president
in
urging
the
passage
of
the
legislation
and
was
used
hundreds
of
times
in
the
debates
and
in
the
committee
hearings
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
as
a
sort
of
short-hand
rendition
of
the
definition
of
boundaries
as
contained
in
the
act.
that
is
boundaries
as
they
existed
at
the
time
the
states
became
members
of
the
union
or
as
approved
by
congress
before
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
that's
correct.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
in
the
sense
that
it's
argued
by
the
government
that
there
was
a
shrinkage
of
the
boundaries
at
that
time.
unquestionably,
when
texas
became
a
member
of
the
union
and
the
other
states
were
admitted,
there
were
changes
in
their
legal
relations.but
the
boundaries
which
had
been
fixed
before
the
final
act
of
admission
and
which
continued
in
effect
up
to
that
time,
also
continued
to
be
their
boundaries
as
state
boundaries.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
and
as
a
matter
of
--
of
fact,
they
had
not
been
appealed.
they
remain
the
boundaries
for
the
purposes
of
the
jurisdiction
and
powers
that
a
state
could
exercise
within
the
coastal
waters
and
they
were
valid
boundaries.
mr.
james
p.
hart
i
think
the
boundaries
of
texas
today
are
three-leagues
in
the
coast
because
that
was
the
boundary
that
was
fixed
at
the
time
we
ended
the
union
and
it
has
not
been
changed
otherwise
with
the
consent
of
congress.
and
i
think
the
consent
of
congress
would
be
necessary
to
change
those
boundaries.
i
was
speaking
of
the
last
--
i
was
getting
to
the
last
clause
in
section
--
subparagraph
--
in
paragraph
(b)
of
section
2
and
i
would
like
to
mention
that.
it
says
that,
“in
no
event
shall
the
term
boundaries
or
the
term
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
be
interpreted
as
extending
from
the
coast
line
more
than
three
geographical
miles
into
the
atlantic
ocean
or
the
pacific
ocean,
or
more
than
three
marine
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.”
now,
the
government
has
argued
in
its
brief
and
it
--
it
is
correct
in
doing
so
that
this
clause
was
added
as
a
clause
of
limitation
on
boundaries
that
extended
more
than
three
miles
from
the
coast.
but
the
significant
point
is,
for
these
states,
that
the
limitation
in
the
case
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
was
placed
at
three
leagues
from
the
coast
whereas,
it
was
placed
three
miles
from
the
coast
in
the
atlantic
ocean
and
the
pacific
ocean.
the
court
will
note
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
mentioned
specially
in
both
of
these
paragraphs
that
i've
just
referred
to.
it's
mentioned
at
the
end
of
subparagraph
(b)
in
connection
with
boundaries
that
extend
beyond
three
miles
from
the
coast
and
in
the
last
part
of
paragraph
(2)
that
i've
referred
to,
it
is
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
boundaries
which
extend
not
more
than
three
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
we
submit
being
a
recognition
of
a
special
situation,
both
historically
and
geographically,
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
will
be
argued
by
counsel
to
follow
me.
but
the
point
is
that
congress
specifically
said
that
the
grant
may
extend
as
much
as
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
section
4
of
the
act
which
is
copied
on
page
337
of
the
government's
brief.
that
section
does
three
things.
in
the
first
sentence,
it
confirms
the
boundary
--
the
seaward
boundary
of
each
original
coasting
state
a
three
geographical
miles
from
its
coastline
or
in
the
case
of
the
great
lakes
to
the
end
of
national
boundary.
and
i
would
like
to
pose
here
to
say
that
this
is
the
only
place
in
the
act
that
is
in
this
section
that
the
national
boundary
is
mentioned
as
the
measure
of
the
grant
to
the
states.
that
is
in
connection
with
the
international
boundary
which
of
course
is
the
national
boundary
in
the
great
lakes.
everywhere
else
in
that,
the
measure
is
the
state
boundaries.
now,
the
next
two
sentences
of
section
4
relate
to
states
who
are
admitted
after
the
formation
of
the
union.
and
it
provides
that
those
states
are
granted
permission
to
extend
their
boundaries
if
they
have
not
already
done
so,
the
three
miles
from
the
coast
and
that
any
act
of
the
state
by
its
laws
or
otherwise
which
showed
an
intent
to
so
extend
its
boundaries,
is
confirmed
by
the
congress.
now,
the
last
sentence
is
the
one
that
is
particularly
applicable
to
the
states
involved
in
this
case,
because
it
deals
with
historic
boundaries
to
use
that
shorthand
phrase
as
boundaries
are
defined
in
section
2.
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
part
of
section
4
and
section
2
should
be
construed
together
to
see
what
congress
meant
by
--
in
section
2
by
boundaries
as
they
existed
at
the
time
each
state
became
a
member
of
the
union.
the
last
sentence
in
section
4
says
that
nothing
in
this
section
is
to
be
construed
as
questioning
or
in
any
manner
prejudicing
the
existence
--
the
existence
of
any
state's
seaward
boundary
beyond
three
geographical
miles,
if
it
was
so
provided
by
its
constitution
or
laws
prior
to
or
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
if
it
had
been
heretofore,
approved
by
congress.
our
point
there,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
said,
“existed
at
the
time
a
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,”
numbers
which
had
been
provided
and
which
were
then
in
effect
as
provided
by
laws
or
the
constitution
of
a
state
prior
to
the
final
act
of
admission.
we
think
that
congress
must
have
had
in
mind
the
process
of
admission
which
is
not
a
single
final
act
of
admission,
but
as
a
--
the
history
of
this
and
other
states
shows,
there's
a
process
which
includes
several
steps.
in
the
case
of
the
four
states
who
were
territories
before
they
were
admitted
to
the
union,
process
of
admission
includes
an
enabling
act
which
sets
out
the
boundaries
of
the
state
and
provides
that
a
constitution,
a
state
constitution
shall
befall.
the
second
step
is
the
formation
of
a
state
constitution
and
these
states
provided
in
their
constitutions
for
their
boundaries.
and
the
third
and
last
step
is
the
act
of
admission,
itself.
now,
congress
there
used
the
words
prior
to
or
at
the
time
of
admission,
because
part
of
the
--
the
--
part
of
the
legal
acts
which
fixed
these
boundaries
were
acts
which
occurred
before
the
final
act
of
admission
that
is
prior
to
the
admission.
and
in
part,
it
was
determined
by
the
act
of
admission
itself.
in
the
case
of
texas,
since
texas
was
an
independent
republic,
its
boundary
was
fixed
by
the
act
of
the
republic
of
texas
on
december
the
19th,
1836,
which
continued
in
effect,
to
the
time
of
texas
admission
to
the
union
in
1845
and
which
was
as
will
be
argued
by
counsel
for
texas
at
length,
approved
by
congress
at
the
time
texas
was
admitted
to
the
union.
so,
we
say
that
the
government
is
in
error
in
saying
that
the
words
at
the
time
that
existed,
at
the
time
of
the
state's
admission
to
the
union,
relate
only
to
what
happened
from
and
after
admission.
and
that
the
whole
process
of
admission
must
be
taken
into
account.
and
that
what
was
provided
in
the
acts
of
congress
in
the
laws
of
the
state
and
the
constitution
of
a
state,
before
admission
and
which
continued
in
effect
up
to
that
time,
is
what
are
the
boundaries
--
the
historic
boundaries,
which
are
the
measure
of
the
grants
in
the
submerged
lands
act
to
these
states.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
i
--
i
think
of
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
i
--
i
think
that's
correct
as
stated,
mr.
justice,
but
i
do
not
--
empathically
do
not
agree
with
the
contention
of
the
government
that
the
boundary
shrank
because
of
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
considerations
of
foreign
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
policy
at
the
time
of
admission.
i
--
i
grant
you
that
the
territories
at
all
times
was
subject
to
national
powers
with
regard
to
foreign
policy
and
that
texas
became
subject
to
national
policy
in
international
relations
when
it
was
admitted.
but
that
has
nothing
to
do,
we
submit,
with
regard
to
its
boundaries
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
as
--
as
defined
in
the
act.
mr.
james
p.
hart
well,
i
would
--
i
understand
that
they
say
that
it's
wholly
irrelevant,
what
may
have
been
the
boundaries
of
the
states
before
the
moment
immediately
after
admission.
i
understand
they
say
that
this
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
texas
had
when
it
was
a
republic
or
what
was
defined
in
these
acts
that
--
or
the
constitutions
that
were
adopted
before
admission.
that
it's
--
it's
the
instant
of
admission
and
thereafter,
that
is
the
only
thing
that
is
relevant
and
we
do
disagree
with
that.
we
think
that
these
acts
of
congress
and
the
constitutions
that
were
--
and
what
was
provided
in
them,
is
relevant
as
defining
the
lines,
the
property
lines
of
the
grants
in
this
case.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
that
presents
a
different
situation
from
the
territories
and
i
would
say
when
the
negotiations
for
the
annexation
of
texas
began,
and
--
and
in
that
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
i
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
i
have
assumed
that
it
was
when
congress
passed
the
act
of
admission,
i
maybe
in
error
on
that,
but
i
have
assumed
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
i'm
sorry.
i
can't
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice.
i
have
assumed
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
that
it
is
that
passage
of
the
act
of
congress
that
constitutes
the
admission.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
i
understand
that
to
be
ascertained.
mr.
james
p.
hart
i
have
--
yes.
i
--
think
that's
--
that's
true.
the
point
is
perhaps
i
should
--
i
could
state
it
better
by
saying
that
congress
had
in
mind,
certain
boundaries
that
existed
at
the
time
of
admission.
and
in
order
to
have
existed
at
that
time,
they
must
have
been
created
by
some
act
prior
to
that
time.
an
act
of
congress
or
constitution
of
the
state
which
was
authorized
by
the
enabling
act
or
in
the
case
of
texas
by
the
boundaries
as
provided
by
the
act
of
the
congress
of
texas.
it
is
that
boundary
that
existed
at
that
time
that
congress
had
in
mind
as
the
limit
of
the
property
rights
which
were
transferred
by
this
act.
mr.
james
p.
hart
well,
i
--
i
think
it
--
yes,
it
would
--
in
this
sense
that
an
act
which
had
been
passed,
to
say,
some
years
before
admission
and
then
which
was
repealed
before
admission,
would
not
be
a
basis
for
a
claim
of
a
--
a
boundary
extending
beyond
three
miles
that
--
but
that
is
really
a
--
a
question
that
doesn't
arise
in
this
case
because
the
acts
which
were
passed
prior
to
the
admission
for
the
union
and
which
fixed
these
boundaries
continued
in
effect
to
the
time
of
admission.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
and
they
--
they
were
specified
in
the
enabling
acts
and
in
the
constitutions
of
the
states
with
the
territories
before
that
was
made.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
i
think
so,
yes,
sir.
without
reading
them,
i
would
like
to
mention
the
fact
that
there
are
two
sections
of
the
act
which
are
not
copied
in
the
government's
brief,
but
which
the
court
would
tell
to
look
at
them
or
copy
them
in
part
on
pages
51
and
52
of
the
joint
brief,
which
is
the
larger
green
brief
filed
by
the
states.
section
3
paragraph
(b),
retains
in
the
national
--
provides
that
nothing
in
this
act
shall
affect
the
use,
development,
improvement
or
control
by
or
under
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
united
states
of
the
lands
and
waters
for
the
purpose
of
navigation
or
flood
control
or
the
production
upheld.
and
section
6
retains
in
the
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
sir?
mr.
james
p.
hart
it's
copied
on
page
51
of
the
joint
brief,
the
green
brief,
the
middle
of
the
page,
section
3
paragraph
(b).
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
then,
section
6
paragraph
(a)
of
the
act
which
is
copied
below
that,
provides
that
the
united
states
retains,
without
reading
at
all,
it
retains
all
the
powers
over
navigation,
over
commerce,
national
navigation,
national
defense
and
international
affairs,
all
of
which
shall
be
paramount
to,
but
which
shall
not
be
deemed
to
include
proprietary
rights
of
ownership
or
the
rights
of
management
which
are
transferred
to
the
states
by
this
act.
in
other
words,
congress
reasoned
that
by
the
use
of
--
of
that
language,
was
trying
to
make
doubly
sure
that
the
effect
of
the
act
was
confined
to
the
proprietary
acts
in
the
submerged
lands
--
proprietary
rights
in
the
submerged
lands
which
were
transferred
by
this
act
and
that
the
act
should
not
have
any
effect
upon
the
national
powers
usually
associated
with
freedom
of
the
seas
and
the
superadjacent
waters
over
commerce,
navigation,
national
defense
and
international
affairs.
now,
with
reference
to
this
question
of
the
construction
of
section
4
and
whether
it
should
be
construed
together
with
section
2,
i
would
like
to
say
that
senator
holland
who
was
the
sponsor
of
this
bill
made
the
following
statement
in
the
debate,
in
the
senate
with
regard
to
what
was
meant
by
these
--
these
historic
boundaries
and
how
they
could
be
established.
he
said
that
the
only
way
that
any
limit
for
any
state
could
ever
be
fixed
beyond
three
geographical
miles
under
the
proposed
law,
would
be
by
fulfilling
the
conditions
prescribed.
that
is
by
showing
that
its
constitution
or
laws
prior
to
or
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
made
such
a
provision
or
if
its
seaward
boundary
has
heretofore
been
approved
by
congress,
which
we
submit.
mr.
james
p.
hart
that
is
copied
in
the
texas
brief
which
is
the
yellow
brief
on
pages
24
and
25
and
26,
the
large
yellow
brief.
mr.
james
p.
hart
senator
holland
and
senator
donnell
and
senator
cordon
in
the
house
--
i
mean,
in
the
senate
and
i'm
not
--
congressmen
reed
of
illinois
and
congresswoman
thompson
of
michigan
and
probably
others
were
sponsors
in
the
house.
they
--
they
always
consider
more
fully
by
the
senate
committee
and
was
debated
considerably
more
fully
in
the
senate,
so
your
usual
references
to
the
legislative
history
or
to
the
debate
or
to
the
committee
hearings
in
the
senate.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
they
are.
now,
the
boundaries
as
defined
in
the
act
are
not
of
course
--
except
by
the
description
and
definition
therein
contained,
specifically
stated,
that
is
that
is
not
said
there
that
texas
gets
a
certain
distance
and
so
forth.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
as
the
counsel
for
each
state
will
argue,
the
boundary
which
existed
at
the
time
of
a
state's
admission
to
the
union
or
as
approved
by
congress,
can
be
readily
identified
by
reference
to
the
acts
of
congress
or
to
the
laws
or
the
constitutions
of
the
states
so
that
there
is
no
difficulty
in
carrying
out
the
effect
of
the
act,
by
referring
to
these
legal
documents
which
will
be
discussed
at
length
by
counsel
for
each
of
the
states.
the
--
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
these
boundaries
as
set
out
in
the
state
statutes
or
the
acts
of
congress
or
the
state
constitutions
and
approved
by
congress
by
its
acts
of
admission
either
expressly
or
by
a
reference,
are
legal
boundaries.
and
they
are
the
boundaries
which
are
referred
to
and
defined
in
the
act
as
the
limit
of
the
grant
of
property
rights
to
the
states.
they
are
legal
boundaries
because
they
were
provided
by
the
competent
legal
authorities
at
the
time
before
and
at
the
time
of
admission.
and
they
had
the
effect
of
describing
the
perimeter
of
the
state
which
was
involved
in
that
admission.
in
determining
further,
these
boundaries
are
legal
boundaries
as
the
government
argues.
we
submit
that
the
court
should
bear
in
mind
if
any
test
is
to
be
applied,
although
then,
simply
that
these
boundaries
were
so
described
in
these
--
on
the
statutes
and
constitutions,
the
court
should
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
a
question,
not
--
the
subject
matter
of
this
suit
is
not
foreign
relations,
but
is
property
rights.
that
is
rights
in
the
submerged
lands
and
the
natural
resources.
and
in
the
second
place
that
the
boundaries
are
state
boundaries
and
that
any
test
is
to
be
applied
as
to
their
validity,
then
it
should
not
be
a
test
which
--
which
would
be
applied
to
a
power,
which
in
any
event
and
anywhere,
can
be
exercised
only
by
the
national
government.
in
effect,
what
the
government
is
trying
to
say
here,
i
submit,
is
that
these
state
boundaries
must
be
tested
by
what
the
national
government
would
do
in
applying
its
exclusive
power
over
international
relations.
we
submit
that
that
in
any
event,
is
not
a
proper
test
of
the
validity
of
a
state
boundary.and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
mention
the
case
that
has
been
referred
to
here,
the
skiriotes
case,
skiriotes
against
florida,
313
u.s.
69,
where
the
question
was
the
validity
of
a
conviction
in
a
florida
court,
of
a
man
who
had
taken
sponges
at
two
leagues
from
the
florida
gulf
coast.
and
the
validity
of
that
conviction
was
attacked
on
the
ground
that
the
act
occurred
beyond
the
territorial
limits
of
florida
and
the
statute
said
that
these
certain
acts
shall
not
be
committed
within
the
territories
of
the
state.
this
court
in
a
unanimous
opinion
by
mr.
--
by
chief
justice
hughes
said
that
in
--
“under
these
circumstances
where
the
defendant
in
the
case
was
a
citizen
of
the
state
and
the
question
was
the
enforcement
against
him
of
a
police
regulation,
that
considerations
of
international
law
and
the
extent
of
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states
were
beside
the
point.
and
all
elements
with
regard
to
treaties
or
with
regard
to
treaties
or
with
regard
to
the
limits
of
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states,
as
they
have
been
described
by
the
court
in
the
cunard
steamship
company
versus
mellon
and
in
diplomatic
correspondence
and
statements
of
the
political
department
of
our
government
is
thus,
beside
the
point.
we
say,
bearing
in
mind
--
first
of
all,
that
these
boundaries
are
valid
boundaries
which
in
the
definition
of
this
act,
because
they
are
the
boundaries
which
were
prescribed
by
the
statutes
and
constitutions
of
the
states
at
the
times
that
congress
designates
in
this
act,
that
that
--
when
that
is
found,
that
that's
all
that
is
necessary
to
make
these
boundaries,
the
lines
to
which
these
grants
go
in
the
submerged
lands.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
mr.
james
p.
hart
but
i
--
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
language
in
section
4
which
refers
to
boundaries
created
prior
to
or
at
the
time
of
admission,
that
the
language
of
this
act
would
mean
that
congress
wouldn't
and
that
congress
intended
to
grant
to
the
boundary
that
texas
had
as
created
by
its
laws
prior
to
admission.
mr.
james
p.
hart
i
wouldn't
think
so,
your
honor.
although
i'm
in
doubt
on
that
and
it
is
not
a
point
which
arises
in
this
case
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
because
there
has
not
been
any
cutting
down
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
by
the
acts
of
admission.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
james
p.
hart
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
well,
no.
i
--
i
think
i
did
not
answer
that
question
fully
because
it
is
shown
by
a
report
of
the
--
of
the
committee
of
congress
on
a
prior
session
when
this
part
of
section
4
was
not
in
there,
that
the
committee
meant
by
existing,
the
boundaries
that
were
fixed
before
the
state's
admission
to
the
union.
so,
the
word,
existed,
i
--
i
think
carries
the
fact
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
mr.
justice,
let
me
make
it
plain
that
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
the
effect
of
the
act
of
admission
containing
that
expressed
provision
would
be
to
reduce
the
boundary
of
texas.
but
since
as
the
government
concedes,
the
congress
could
grant
to
the
states
property
rights
in
the
submerged
lands
to
any
line
that
it
chose,
then,
it
does
not
have
to
grant
--
make
the
grant
on
the
basis
of
legal
rights.
it
can
pick
out
just
any
line
that
it
wants
to
and
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
it
--
it
is
given
to
texas
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
it's
the
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
well,
that
--
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
is
what
the
submerged
lands
act
is.
this
court
has
held
in
louisiana
--
in
the
louisiana
case
and
in
the
texas
case
that
the
states
have
no
property
rights
beyond
--
below
watermark.
so,
what
it
gets
even
out
to
three
miles
which
the
--
which
the
government
concedes
to
be
valid
and
which
this
court
held,
is
a
grant
of
something
that
the
states
had
no
legal
right
to
under
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
james
p.
hart
exactly.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
now
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
mr.
james
p.
hart
now,
may
i
then
say
what
i
--
i
think
it
--
it
meant
by
boundary
and
--
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
the
general
purpose
of
this
act.
the
--
the
--
since
the
purpose
of
the
act
obviously
was
to
make
a
settlement
on
--
on
a
policy
basis
--
on
the
basis
of
the
public
interest
of
a
controversy
over
property
rights
between
the
national
and
the
state
government.
now,
for
many
years,
before
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
california
and
louisiana
and
texas
cases,
the
states
thought
that
they
had
certain
property
rights
in
the
submerged
land.
this
court
held
that
they
were
mistaken.
i
don't
understand
that
they
held
that
the
states
were
fraudulent.
they
held
that
they
were
mistaken
as
a
matter
of
law
in
--
in
thinking
and
asserting
and
exercising
certain
rights,
property
rights
in
the
submerged
lands.
but
in
the
california
case,
language
was
used
which
members
of
congress
and
others
thought
indicated
that
congress
--
that
these
rights
that
the
government
had
that
includedproperty
rights
and
that
those
property
rights
were
subject
to
the
disposition
of
congress
without
limitation
by
any
test
that
congress
sought
to
apply.
the
congressional
debates
show
that
the
test
that
congress
intended
to
apply
to
the
limit
of
these
grants
was
a
test
of
what
congress
thought
as
a
matter
of
policy,
was
fair
and
equitable
and
just.
not
--
not
a
legal
right
because
this
court
have
held
the
states
didn't
have
any
legal
rights
to
--
to
those
proprietary
matters.
what
--
on
the
basis
of
what
it
thought
would
be
just
in
view
of
the
long
asserted,
good
faith
claims
of
the
states
to
these
rights.
and
for
that
reason,
it
--
it
took
these
lines
as
set
out
in
the
constitution
from
the
statutes
of
the
states
at
the
time
they
were
admitted
to
the
union
or
as
approved
by
congress
in
the
case
of
florida.
well
--
and
that
--
that
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
is
limited
of
what,
sir?
mr.
james
p.
hart
no.
i
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
no,
not
--
no,
sir,
certainly
not.
but
the
--
what
i
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
what
i
should've
said
was
that
the
florida
is
primary
reliance
is
upon
an
approval
by
congress
of
its
boundaries
set
out
in
its
constitution
of
1868
mr.
james
p.
hart
sir?
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
but
their
--
their
primarily
reliance
is
upon
the
boundaries
as
they
existed,
as
i
understand
it,
and
they're
also
as
approved
by
congress.
now,
since
as
--
is
shown
by
the
congressional
history
of
this
act,
the
question
before
congress
was
the
settlement
of
a
domestic
dispute
over
property
rights
and
that
was
to
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
what
was
fair
and
just
and
equitable
as
a
matter
of
policy.
we
submit
that
any
question
of
foreign
relations
is
--
is
obviously
irrelevant
to
a
determination
of
that
question.
and
any
test
based
on
foreign
relations
should
not
be
read
into
the
act
when
--
as
the
court
recalls,
there
is
no
mention
whatever,
of
a
national
boundary
or
any
other
test
except
simply
what
the
boundaries
were
provided
by
their
constitution
and
laws
at
that
time.
now
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
there's
no
--
there's
no
difference
and
the
government
conceives
that
as
i
understand
it
in
its
briefs
that
whether
under
--
as
the
result
of
this
case,
the
states
get
out
to
three-leagues
or
three
miles
will
make
no
difference
in
our
foreign
policy
or
in
the
rights
of
other
nations.
now,
they
do
--
and
while
the
act
was
being
considered,
congress
was
not
unaware
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
as
stated
by
the
secretary
of
state
in
favor
of
a
three-mile
limit.
it
was
advised
by
mr.
jack
b.
tate,
the
deputy
legal
adviser
to
the
department
of
state
that
--
about
the
three-mile
limit.
but
it
was
also
advised
that
it
couldn't
transfer
these
rights
to
the
states
within
the
framework
of
our
traditional
international
position.
and
mr.
tate
was
asked
how
that
could
be
done
and
he
said
it
depended
upon
the
jurisdiction
and
control
that
was
transferred
to
the
states.
and
said,
in
effect
that
if
that
was
limited
to
rights
in
the
submerged
lands
similar
to
those
which
had
been
asserted
by
president
truman
in
his
proclamation
that
then
there
would
be
no
interference
with
our
foreign
relations.
and
we
submit
that
the
act
as
i've
discussed
it
here,
shows
that
congress
deliberately
limited
this
transfer
to
property
rights
and
furthermore,
specifically
reserved
to
the
national
government,
all
rights
in
connection
with
navigation,
commerce,
international
affairs
and
national
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
bearing
of
international
law
upon
what,
sir?
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
i
--
it
does
show
that,
but
it
--
it
shows
that
they
--
we
submit
that
being
conscious
of
the
possession
of
the
state
department,
they
made
it
clear
that
this
was
simply
a
transfer
of
property
rights
and
that
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
the
foreign
policy
was
not
to
be
considered
in
the
--
in
determining
the
measure
of
the
grant
in
the
act.
now,
there
were
attempts
when
the
act
was
being
debated
in
the
senate
and
in
the
house
to
tie
the
grant
to
the
states
to
foreign
policy
by
tieing
it
to
a
three-mile
limit.
there
are
three
efforts
to
amend
the
bill
in
the
senate.
one
of
them
was
opposed
by
senator
anderson
of
new
mexico,
who
was
one
of
the
leading
opponents
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
he
said
in
--
i
quote
part
of
what
he
said
here,
the
full
quote
is
on
page
25
of
our
joint
brief.“my
substitute
does
try
to
follow
the
three-mile
limit.
whereas,
the
holland
resolution
does
not
do
so,
instead,
the
joint
resolution
sets
a
line
as
far
as
10
and
one-half
miles
off
the
shore.”
his
amendment
was
defeated
and
all
similar
amendments
to
tie
the
grant
to
foreign
policy
in
the
form
of
the
three-mile
limit
were
defeated
showing
and
we
submit
that
congress
deliberately
chose
to
measure
this
grant
not
by
questions
of
foreign
policy,
but
by
simply
fixing
lines
which
it
thought
were
fair
lines
with
the
transfer
of
property
rights.
the
president
took
part
in
the
legislative
process
and
we
submit
that
his
statements
are
therefore,
relevant.
he
urged
the
passage
of
the
act
to
historic
boundaries
before
the
act
came
up.
while
the
act
was
being
considered,
about
20
senators
wrote
him
a
letter
asking
him
to
state
his
position
on
the
act
and
stating
that
any
grants
beyond
three
miles
would
embarrass
and
obstruct
the
united
states
and
its
foreign
relations.
the
president
answered
restating
of
what
he
had
said
in
public
speeches
that
he
favored
the
grant
to
the
states
to
their
historic
boundaries
and
by
way
of
illustration
of
what
he
meant,
referring
to
the
submerged
area
extending
to
texas
submerged
area
extending
three
marine
leagues
seaward
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
he
urged
the
passage
of
the
act.
surely,
president
eisenhower
was
aware
of
the
three-mile
limit
policy.
and
if
he
had
thought
that
the
act
in
anyway
violated
their
policy,
we
believe
that
he
would
not
have
urged
this
passage
when
as
he
specifically
said,
he
thought
that
the
effect
of
the
act
was
at
least
as
to
one
state
to
give
rights
out
to
three
miles
--
i
mean,
to
three
leagues.
the
--
and
we
--
we
think
that
it
--
that
what
the
court
says
--
said
in
the
case
of
alabama
against
texas,
has
some
relevance
particularly
since
that
case
was
handed
down
less
than
a
year
after
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
act
hasn't
been
passed
in
may
of
1953
and
the
decision
in
alabama
against
texas
being
handed
down
in
march
of
1954.
while,
certainly,
the
point
was
not
decided,
we
submit
that
reading
the
opinions
in
the
case,
indicates
clearly
that
it
was
assumed
by
all
parties
at
that
time
that
as
to
at
least
some
of
the
gulf
states,
they
got
rights
out
to
three
leagues
in
the
gulf.
in
fact,
in
one
of
the
opinions
--
dissenting
opinions,
it
stated
that
some
states
got
about
10
miles
indicating
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
if
everybody
understood
it,
at
that
time,
closed
to
the
passage
of
the
act
about
five
and
a
half
years
ago.
mr.
james
p.
hart
i
--
i
was
citing
the
case
in
this
instance,
i
might
say
that
--
that
leads
me
to
my
next
point
which
is
that
--
i'm
proud
to
say
so
far,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
terms
of
the
act
do
not
limit
the
grant
by
foreign
policy
or
the
--
or
the
definition
of
any
limit
on
territorial
waters
as
set
out
by
correspondents
of
secretaries
of
state.
mr.
james
p.
hart
if
it
could
be
a
limitation
on
that,
yes,
sir.
we
submit
that
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
mean
that
--
that
foreign
policy
would
be
a
limitation
on
the
boundaries
as
to
they're
existing
because
it
refers
to
the
kind
of
boundaries
that
i've
mentioned.
now,
we
submit
that
--
that
since
the
act
by
its
terms
does
not
contain
this
limitation
and
since
it
was
clearly
not
the
intention
of
congress
that
the
grant
should
be
limited
by
a
foreign
policy,
that
the
states
are
granted
rights
out
to
three
leagues.
we
further
submit
that
considerations
of
construction
of
statutes
properly
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
this
act
should
be
construed
so
as
to
give
it
full
effect
including
the
provisions
in
the
act
for
--
or
relating
--
referring
to
boundaries
beyond
the
three
miles
and
out
to
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
as
i
said
before,
the
government
repeatedly
conceives
that
the
congress
had
the
power
to
make
a
grant
to
any
line
that
it
wanted
to
choose.
that
that
line
could
be
all
the
way
out
to
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf,
if
congress
had
chosen
to
place
it
that
far,
that
since
this
is
a
matter
of
a
division
of
property
rights
in
an
area
in
which
it
is
conceded,
that
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
control
according
to
the
convention
in
the
continental
shelf
that
was
adopted
at
geneva
that
year,
it
--
it
has
sovereign
rights
by
a
reason
of
being
the
coast
of
the
state
adjacent
to
the
continental
shelf.
that
--
that
since
that
is
the
situation
that
whether
the
control
which
the
united
states
has
over
these
rights
in
the
continental
shelf
is
to
be
exercised
by
the
national
government
or
by
the
states,
is
a
matter
of
domestic
distribution
of
powers
which
does
not
concern
other
nations.
so,
we
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
either
for
--
with
regard
to
the
purpose
or
the
effect
of
the
act
to
--
to
imply
or
to
read
into
the
act
a
limitation
upon
the
grant
which
is
not
found
in
the
act
itself
nor
--
and
which
we
submit,
would
be
contrary
to
the
intention
of
congress
as
shown
by
the
congressional
debates.
mr.
james
p.
hart
we
disagree
with
that,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
james
p.
hart
the
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
as
--
our
position
is
this,
that
the
term
“boundaries”
is
a
word
that
is
used
as
a
geographical
expression
which
was
well-known
and
in
current
use
before
this
question
of
the
limit
of
territorial
waters
arose
for
--
and
that
is
pointed
out
by
mr.
dulles
(ph)
in
his
letter
on
page
343
of
the
government's
brief
that
the
term
“territorial
waters”
was
not
in
use
at
the
time
jefferson
wrote
his
letter
in
1793.
but
obviously,
the
term
“boundaries”
was
used
because
it
was
used
for
example
in
the
treaty
of
1783,
the
treaty
of
--
of
paris,
which
is
copied
on
page
6
and
7
of
our
letter
reply
brief.
in
other
words,
it
states
what
the
boundaries
are
and
those
boundaries
include
a
boundary
in
the
atlantic
ocean
which
is
determined
by
drawing
lines
20
leagues
into
the
ocean,
due
east,
from
the
boundary
of
florida
and
nova
scotia
and
then
wanting
the
line
along
the
ocean
to
see
what
islands
are
included
within
that
boundary.
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
the
--
the
nation
will
exercise
the
powers
which
go
with
territorial
waters
as
that
term
has
come
to
be
recognized
since
that
time,
is
a
question
of
foreign
policy
which
is
--
which
may
vary
from
time
to
time
and
which
does
not
necessarily
depend
on
boundary.
we
submit
that
--
that
boundary
does
not
by
any
means
--
is
not
by
any
means
confined
in
its
meaning
to
the
limit
of
territorial
waters
which
will
be
determined
by
considerations
of
foreign
policy.
another
example
is
the
use
of
the
word,
“boundary”
in
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo.
that
boundary
is
copied
on
--
in
the
relevant
portion
of
the
treaty
fixing
that
boundary,
is
copied
on
page
98
of
the
state's
joint
brief.
that
treaty
--
that
section
of
the
treaty
provided
that
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
republics
shall
commence
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
three
leagues
from
land.
now,
that
was
a
boundary.
it
says
that
commence
is
incidental,
mr.
justice.
three
leagues
from
land,
it's
not
simply
a
call
to
go
up
to
the
beginning
point,
but
that
is
the
beginning
point
of
the
boundary.
and
we
submit
that
it
--
it
was
fixed
there
because
texas
already
had
a
boundary
and
the
--
and
which
the
government
had
recognized
when
texas
was
admitted
to
the
union
at
three-leagues
in
the
boundary.
so,
the
logical
place
to
begin
the
boundary
between
mexico
and
united
states
and
incidentally
this
is
a
boundary
between
mexico
and
united
states,
was
--
well,
the
boundary
ended
there
at
that
point
three
leagues
from
land.
now
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
page
98
of
the
green
--
large
green
brief,
the
--
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
was
copied
there.
now,
to
--
to
further
answer
the
question
that
was
asked
to
me
as
to
whether
or
not,
boundary
necessarily
means
a
limit
of
territorial
waters.
we
say
that
it
does
not.
we
think
that
beginning
in
the
--
about
1870
thereabout,
the
government
did
adopt
a
policy
limiting
the
exercise
of
rights
within
what
are
called
“territorial
waters”
to
three
miles.
but
that
is
a
question
of
foreign
policy
which
was
decided
as
such
and
not
necessarily
with
reference
to
any
boundary.
in
fact,
the
word,
“boundary”
is
usually
not
found
in
any
diplomatic
correspondence.
it's
simply
--
they
say
a
limit
of
territorial
sea
or
something
of
that
kind.
and
we
believe
that
boundary
must
be
considered
in
--
in
this
act
as
it
is
defined
here
and
that
it
is
erroneous
to
identify
a
boundary
with
the
outer
limits
of
territorial
waters.
another
example
was
the
boundary
that
was
fixed
of
a
session
to
alaska
by
russia
in
1867,
which
fixed
a
western
limit
of
that
session
out
in
the
middle
of
the
bering
sea.
what
the
government
has
felt
free
not
to
exercise
jurisdiction
out
that
far,
although
it
originally
did
so
and
now
exercises
jurisdiction
only
out
to
three
miles.
we
submit
that
they
are
separate
questions
and
that
there
is
not
a
necessary
identity
between
the
boundary
--
such
as
a
boundary
provided
in
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
or
--
and
the
limit
of
territorial
waters.
now,
we
don't
say
that
the
act
which
fixed
the
limit
of
the
exercise
of
customs
jurisdiction
at
four
leagues
or
the
--
or
the
acts
by
which
the
government
has
exercised
jurisdiction
beyond
three
miles
in
the
ocean,
fixes
necessarily
the
state
boundaries.
what
we
do
say
is
that
there
is
--
that
--
that
there
are
various
limits
of
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
nation
which
are
independent
of
boundaries.
and
that
the
government
is
--
is
in
error
in
stating
that
the
state
boundaries
or
that
any
boundaries
must
necessarily
be
what
has
come
to
be
defined
as
the
three-mile
limit.
we
have
cited
in
our
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
i
think
that
is
their
position
but
we
--
we
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
well,
if
--
if
they
were
right
about
this,
then
everything
that
congress
put
in
there
about
boundaries
extending
beyond
three
miles
and
out
to
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
were
absolutely
futile
and
meaningless
because
congress
knew
what
the
three-mile
limit
policy
was.
it
had
been
fully
advised
without
that.
and
if
--
if
that
policy
was
to
be
a
limit
on
the
grant
to
the
states,
then
it
just
set
out
three
miles
and
quit.
mr.
james
p.
hart
or
they
could've
voted
for
those
two
amendments,
but
they
decided
not
to
do
so
and
instead,
claim
the
act
as
they
did,
transferring
right
out
to
the
states'
historic
boundaries.
we
--
the
government
has
argued
that
the
letters
of
secretary
dulles
(ph)
are
conclusive
of
--
in
determining
this
matter,
but
we
submit
that
what
the
effect
of
foreign
policy
maybe
upon
the
construction
of
the
statute,
is
a
legal
question
which
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
a
judicial
question
and
is
not
a
question
of
policy
that
we
would
conceive
and
that
the
secretary
of
state
in
the
absence
of
a
contrary
act
of
congress
or
a
position
taken
by
the
president
in
the
executive
declaration
or
otherwise,
can
decide
what
current
foreign
policy
aid
is.
but,
we
say
that
he
cannot
tell
this
court
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case
or
tell
this
court
conclusively
that
it
must
be
governed
by
foreign
policy
in
deciding
the
geographic
coverage
of
the
statute
particularly
where
the
subject
matter
of
this
act
is
not
foreign
relations,
but
property
rights
in
an
area
that
is
in
the
submerged
lands
in
the
continental
shelf
where
everybody
in
its
--
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
alone
has
jurisdiction
and
control.
mr.
james
p.
hart
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
solicitor
has
elected
to
pitch
his
case
against
texas
on
the
proposition
that
this
three-league
boundary
shrunk
when
it
came
in
the
union
and
we
join
the
square
issue
with
him
on
that
on
the
facts.
when
the
congress
of
texas
sat
down
to
--
in
1836,
december,
it
passed
that
act.
it
was
looking
at
several
things.
things
that
were
most
conscious
of
was
the
treaty
between
spain
and
united
states
in
1819
which
called
to
fix
the
boundary,
the
louisiana
boundary
between
texas
and
louisiana.
and
it
called
to
commence
on
the
gulf
at
the
mouth
of
sabine
in
the
sea.
so
the
most
--
the
first
thing
they
had
to
consider
was
that
they
--
the
boundary
calls
commenced
in
the
sea.
now,
the
second
thing
they
had
to
look
up
at
was
that
in
1811
and
1812,
the
state
boundary
of
louisiana
had
been
fixed
by
an
act
of
congress
first,
carving
out
the
territory
and
then
it
made
a
mistake.
and
so
they
look
at
that
description
which
was
a
matter
of
law
and
that
description
called
to
commence
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
goes
around
louisiana
and
call
for
all
islands
within
three
leagues.
so
that
were
two
things
they
had
to
look
at.
now,
if
they
had
heard
anybody
to
look
at
letters
of
the
secretary
of
state
in
fixing
boundaries,
they
could
have
looked
at
the
letter
that
--
that
mr.
jefferson
wrote
when
he
was
secretary
of
state,
the
1790
--
1793
letter.
and
what
did
that
say?
it
said,
first,
that
the
greatest
distance
to
which
any
respectable
set
among
nations
has
been
given
is
human
sight
or
20
miles.
it
said
second,
that
the
smallest
distance
is
a
canon
shot
or
three
miles.
it
said,
third,
three
leagues
has
some
authority
in
its
favor,
and
it
says
fourth,
that
we
ought
to
call
a
convention
of
the
nations
to
fix
--
to
fix
the
maritime
boundary.
and
said
that
we
will
reserve
the
right
to
fix
our
maritime
boundary
but
tentatively
and
for
the
time
being,
we
are
fixing
it
at
three
miles,
and
they
said
three
leagues
has
got
a
card
in
its
favor.
so
what
did
those
people
do
in
writing
that
act.
they
did
a
logical
thing.
they
commenced
in
the
sea
as
the
treaty
command
them.
they
tied
on
to
the
court
of
louisiana.
they
concedes
it
to
be
which
was
three
leagues
and
jefferson
had
said
that
three
leagues
had
some
authorities
favored,
so
they
thought
they
were
within
the
policy
of
the
united
states
and
we
say
they
were.
now,
the
next
fact
in
these
series
of
events
which
you're
looking
at
for
the
annexation
is
the
recognition
of
texas
by
the
united
states.
now,
there
was
a
great
public
interest
at
that
time.
the
conscious
of
the
nation
had
been
shocked
by
the
massacre
at
goliad
and
the
--
the
tragedy
of
the
alamo.
and
the
people
had
been
elated
by
the
victory
of
san
jacinto.
the
whole
spirit
at
the
time
request
for
an
expansion
and
the
whole
attention
of
the
country
was
concentrated
on
these
events
going
on
along
the
frontier.
and
so,
on
december
the
19th,
they
passed
this
act.
now,
we've
just
had
a
visit
from
the
president
of
mexico.
at
that
time,
they
had
another
visit
from
another
president
of
mexico,
sta.
anna.
the
president
of
mexico
has
brought
a
prisoner
of
war
and
appeared
before
jackson
and
his
cabmen.
the
only
time
in
the
history
of
united
states,
that's
happened
and
discussed
this
very
question
of
the
boundary
of
texas.
it
was
a
question
of
great
public
importance.
it
was
debated
all
over
the
country
and
the
whole
country
knew
about
it.
and
it
passed
this
act
and
they
gave
it
wide
circulation.
jackson
was
charged
by
his
opponent.
he
was
being
--
having
denied
with
sam
houston
his
friend
and
--
and
protégé
to
bring
about
this
texas
revolution.
and
so
jackson
was
cautious
in
recognizing
texas.
he
waited
some
six
or
seven
months.
and
then
on
march
the
3rd,
just
before
his
term
expired,
the
senate
passed
a
resolution
authorizing
to
recognize
texas
and
there
appoint
an
agent.
and
on
march,
the
--
that
was
on
march
the
1st.
on
march
the
3rd,
which
was
the
last
day
of
his
great
administration,
a
turbulent
administration,
won
the
grace
from
united
states
as
the
last
official
act
of
that
administration.
at
11
o'clock
in
the
evening,
he
called
in
the
people
from
texas
to
the
agent
and
--
and
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
recognized
texas.
that's
the
last
thing
he
did.
and
at
that
time,
there
was
no
protest,
no
diplomatic
protest
of
this
--
this
act.
and
we
say
that's
a
positive
evidence
of
united
states
foreign
policy.
the
normal
way
for
a
country
to
formalize
its
foreign
policy
and
leads
matter
just
by
diplomatic
protest.
and
there
was
none.
and
we
say
that's
evidence
that
this
act
did
not
violate
the
--
the
foreign
policy.
the
next
event
of
any
consequent
was
the
authority
of
annexation
attempt
in
1838.
after
the
--
after
that
recognition,
the
people
of
texas,
by
a
general
vote,
voted
to
come
into
the
union,
and
then
there
was
an
abrupt
change
of
climate,
a
public
opinion
all
over
the
united
states,
because
texas
was
injected
into
the
called
over
a
debate
our
slavery
and
slave
territory.
and
so
--
and
this
--
a
second
thing
involved
this
texas
boundary
act,
and
that
was
that
it
had
claimed
a
part
of
what's
now
used
to
be
mexico,
the
old
spanish
town
of
santa
fe.
and
so
the
opponents
of
annexation
argued
that
it
was
an
expansion
of
slave
territory
that
it
involved
a
certain
war
with
mexico.
and
that
generate
one
of
the
most
heated
political
controversies
this
country
has
ever
gone
through.
congress
was
covered
up
with
--
with
petitions,
memorials,
resolutions.
one
congress
had
said
they
were
measured
by
the
cubic
feet
on
its
desk.
over
600,000
signatures
appeared
from
the
congressional
records
against
the
--
the
annexation
of
texas.
ex-president
john
quincy
adams,
then
a
member
of
congress
and
the
leading
architect
of
our
foreign
policy
up
to
that
time,
(inaudible)
from
june
the
16th,
july
the
7th,
every
morning
until
congress
adjourned
and
he
himself
killed
annexation
at
that
time,
and
that
no
--
at
that
time,
there
was
no
protest
of
this
act
although
it
had
been
woven
into
all
of
these
debates
because
of
this
question
of
the
--
of
the
--
going
north
into
--
beyond
the
missouri
compromise
lines.
the
anti-slavery
--
the
post
slavery
people
said
this
would
bring
in
free
as
well
as
slave
territories.
the
anti-slavery
people
said,
“well,
the
--
the
free
territories
barren
mountains
been
headed
by
wild
indian
tribes.
and
--
so
that
was
a
matter
of
public
debate
and
that
texas
boundary
act
was
known
throughout
the
united
states
at
that
time.
now,
the
next
consequence
--
that
of
any
consequence
of
the
fact
to
be
considered
was
the
19
--
1830
boundary
convention.
the
act
itself,
the
final
clause
of
it,
if
you'll
notice,
commanded
the
president
of
texas,
to
call
for
a
convention
with
the
--
with
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
putting
that
to
be
in
line
on
the
ground,
and
that
was
done.
the
texas
boundary
commissioner
was
instructed
to
follow
the
texas
boundary
act,
in
that
they
had
a
treaty.
they
had
a
joint
commission
appointed.
mr.
hunter
miller,
at
page
136,
i
might
--
might
say
that
--
that
this
record
here
is
the
official
record
of
the
state
department
published
by
hunter
miller
is
--
is
the
--
the
last
words
so
far
as
united
states
and
everybody
else
is
concerned
on
--
on
diplomatic
foreign
policy.
mr.
hunter
miller
says
the
boundaries
of
texas,
as
claimed
by
the
government
has
thus
described
in
the
instructions
of
march
30
--
21st,
1830
from
(inaudible)
and
secretary
of
state,
memucan
hunt.
memucan
hunt
was
the
--
the
boundary
commissioner.
mr.
james
p.
hart
this
is
from
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
miller
--
no,
sir,
it's
--
it's
cited
but
in
here.
this
is
from
miller,
a
hunter
miller's
book.
the
treaty
is
in
documents
of
united
states.
the
present
boundaries
of
texas
as
fixed
by
an
act
of
congress
are
as
follows.
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
sabine
and
running
west
along
the
gulf
of
mexico,
three
leagues
from
land
to
the
mouth
of
rio
grande
and
it
goes
on
around
says
--
and
hunter
miller
says,
“that
description
of
the
boundaries
of
texas
must
be
taken
almost
literality
from
the
texas
act
of
december
19th,
1836
to
define
the
boundaries
of
republic
of
texas.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
james
p.
hart
page
106.
106
--
136,
page
number
(inaudible).
now,
that
boundary
commission
met.
they
had
a
dispute
there.
the
--
the
treaty,
the
1819
treaty
called
for
the
west
bank
of
the
sabine.
the
louisiana
state
act
called
for
the
middle
of
the
river
and
texas
commissioner
went
over
that
contending
for
the
middle
of
the
river
and
the
united
states
held
him
to
the
terms
of
his
own
boundary
act
which
calls
for
that
treaty
in
the
west
bank
of
the
sabine.
and
--
and
we
say
that
at
that
time,
there
was
no
protest,
no
diplomatic
protest
of
the
three-league
provision
and
that
is
evidenced
that
it
did
not
violate
united
states
foreign
policy.
in
1844,
annexation
was
revived.
it
was
revived
by
the
policy
of
england.
england
who
was
following
the
divide
and
conquer
policy,
and
they
have
--
they
sought
to
erect
a
buffer
state
between
united
states
and
mexico
to
go
from
texas
west
to
the
pacific
and
to
include
the
northern
tier
of
mexican
states.
and
the
--
the
problems
of
texas
became
the
number
one
foreign
relations
problem
of
the
tyler
administration
and
dominated.
senator
walker,
who
was
a
pawn
of
annexation,
wrote
a
propaganda
letter
of
which
over
50,000
copies
were
spread
all
over
united
states
and
he
got
2200
replies
he
said.
i
want
to
review
briefly
the
politics
of
that
time.
clay,
who
was
the
absorbed
and
obtained
a
nomination
of
the
whig
party
did
it
on
a
platform
against
the
annexation
expressed
to
van
buren
with
seeking
a
nomination
of
the
democratic
party
on
a
platform
against
annexation,
polk,
a
dark
horse
sought
the
nomination
of
the
democratic
party
on
a
platform
favoring
annexation.
and
tyler,
the
incumbent
president,
who
had
been
repudiated
by
his
own
party,
sought
to
organize
a
third
party
on
the
motto
of
texas
and
oregon.
polk
and
clay
and
tyler
run
it
all,
jackson
intervened,
persuaded
tyler
to
get
out,
and
--
and
they
went
on
and
--
and
polk
won
on
the
basis
of
annexation.
daniel
webster
said,
in
--
during
election,
it's
either
polk
and
texas
or
neither
polk
nor
texas.
(inaudible)
wrote
a
poem
to
arose
the
abolitionist
and
so
on.
and
in
that
presidential
campaign,
this
country
turned
one
of
the
corners
in
its
history.
it
debated
the
policy
of
western
expansion
and
it
--
it
decided
on
the
policy
of
western
expansion.
so
that
with
polk
selection,
the
doctrine
of
manifest
destiny
and
the
western
expansion
became
a
dominant
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
we
distinguished
between
territorial
waters
and
boundaries,
your
honor.
we
say
this
act
did
it
but
it
didn't
have
to.
a
nation
may
renounced
part
of
its
territorial
waters
apart
of
its
--
what
it
gets
under
our
boundary.
we
say
this
act
established
a
valid
boundary
three
leagues
at
seas.
mr.
james
p.
hart
it
--
it
did.
yes,
sir.
it
didn't
have
to,
but
it
did.
mr.
james
p.
hart
we
--
we
defer
with
them.
we
say
if
we
establish
a
boundary,
state
boundary
even
though
it's
not
within
the
state's
functions
to
establish
territorial
waters,
if
we
establish
a
valid
state
boundary
that
we're
entitled
to
it
at
all.
mr.
james
p.
hart
mr.
justice,
we
contend
that
the
united
states
did
not
have
a
three-mile
exclusive
policy
at
the
time.
and
then
we
argue
that
it
actually
established
a
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf.
we
think
the
evidence
of
that
infatuates
that.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
now,
let's
focus
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
we
establish
that
with
one
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
now,
focusing
on
the
--
on
the
very
act
of
annexation
in
--
in
response
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
yesterday,
the
very
answer
to
annexation,
i
want
to
go
over
the
--
the
time
process.
the
texas
commissioner
to
negotiate
annexation
were
instructed
both
the
limits
of
texas
being
defined
by
act
of
congress,
you'll
be
governed
by
the
--
that
act
in
specifying
its
boundaries.
the
annexation
process
started
on
march
the
1st,
1845,
when
the
--
the
act
--
solicitor
has
identified
with
the
adjustment
clause,
and
it
was
passed.
on
march
the
18th,
1845,
polk
--
polk
had
named
a
man
named
donelson
as
his
agent
accomplished
annexation
in
texas.
donelson
wrote
and
told,
“it
was
upon
houston,
he
mainly
relied
to
carry
the
annexation
in
texas.
and
then
on
april
the
12th,
donelson
had
written
polk
about
houston,
says,
“i
left
him
under
full
conviction
that
if
the
adoption
of
our
proposal
of
(inaudible)
upon
his
voting
would
be
lost.”
on
march
the
5th
--
may
the
5th,
president
anson
jones
called
an
--
by
executive
proclamation
for
a
convention
on
july
the
4th,
the
purpose
accepting
annexation
and
adopting
a
--
a
state
constitution.
and
on
june
the
6th,
1845,
president
polk
wrote
to
houston
urging
him
to
support
annexation
and
--
and
this
--
this
calls
about
adjusting
boundaries
had
bothered
houston.
and
so
he
wanted
to
know
what
kind
of
adjustments
they
were
talking
about.
and
so
president
polk
wrote
to
him
this.
“you
may
have
no
apprehensions
in
regard
to
your
boundary.
texas
once
a
part
of
the
union,
and
we
will
maintain
all
your
rights
of
territory,
and
we'll
not
suffer
them
to
be
sacrificed.”
i
mentioned
the
question
of
your
boundary
because
you
allude
to
it
in
your
letter.
i
assure
you
that
it
will
be
my
duty
as
it
will
be
my
pleasure
to
guard
your
interest
in
that
respect
with
vigilance
and
care.
mr.
james
p.
hart
the
main
bone
of
controversy
was
between
nueces
river
and
the
rio
grande.
they
were
not
particularly
concentrating
on
the
seaward
portion
of
it.
but
they
did
--
they
did
allude
to
the
whole
line.
mr.
james
p.
hart
he
was
out
of
office
but
his
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
he's
a
private
citizen
but
a
dominant
political
figure
and
his
former
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
he
was
a
former
president
and
his
man
was
then
president
(inaudible).
polk
carried
out
his
promise
to
houston.
in
writing
to
his
agent,
polk
said
to
donelson
on
june
the
15th,
of
course,
i
would
maintain
the
text
and
title
of
the
extent
he
claimed
it
to
be.
on
june
the
23rd,
the
texas
congress
met,
passed
a
joint
resolution
concerning
the
annexation
and
ratifying
the
call
for
constitutional
amendment.
on
july
the
4th,
that
--
that
convention
met,
passed
an
ordinance
accepting
the
annexation,
went
to
work
on
the
constitution.
it
was
completely
late
august
and
on
the
second
monday
of
october,
they
held
a
general
election
in
which
the
people
approved
annexation
a
new
state
constitution,
and
that
came
back
on
december
the
29th,
u.s.
congress
a
joint
resolution
was
passed.
and
on
february
the
16th,
a
small
ceremony
in
front
of
the
little
log
cabin
capital,
the
republic
flag
was
pulled
down
and
united
states
flag
went
up.
now,
here
is
one
of
the
most
important
documents
i
am
coming
to
it
in
the
chain
of
title.
on
december
the
8th,
which
was
that
same
year,
president
polk,
in
his
second
annual
message
to
congress,
dealt
with
this
very
question
of
what
territory
came
in
--
with
about
texas.
he
was
truly
concentrating
on
the
dispute
with
mexico
there
between
the
nueces
and
rio
grande.
but
here's
what
he
said
in
his
congressional
message,
he
said
the
congress
of
texas,
on
the
19th
of
december
1836,
passed
an
act
to
define
the
boundaries
of
the
republic
of
texas.
and
then
this
is
important.
he
said,
“this
was
the
texas
which
by
the
act
of
our
congress
of
29th
of
december
1845
was
admitted
as
one
of
the
states
of
the
union."
and
we
say
that
under
the
authority
cited
by
the
solicitor,
that
was
a
--
an
executive
determination
of
a
political
question
made
at
the
time
by
the
president's
office
which
is
binding
and
covers
this
matter.
mr.
james
p.
hart
in
the
--
in
the
polk's
second
annual
message
of
congress.
mr.
james
p.
hart
this
was
the
texas
which
by
the
act
of
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
this
was
the
texas
which
by
the
act
of
our
congress
of
the
29th
of
december,
1845
was
admitted
as
one
of
the
states
of
our
union.
now,
the
next
event
is
the
war
with
mexico.
mr.
james
p.
hart
sir?
mr.
james
p.
hart
we're
here
to
say,
he
had
already
referred
about
(inaudible)
of
the
heading.
he
referred
to
this
act
of
1836.
he
identified
it
in
his
message.
mr.
james
p.
hart
the
act.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
now,
the
next
thing
was
a
--
was
the
presidential
message
declaring
war.
we
say
that
if
you're
looking
for
evidence
of
foreign
policy,
the
--
the
supreme
evidence
of
any
foreign
policy
is
a
declaration
of
war.
and
the
message
would
be
the
--
the
best
evidence
of
what
it
was.
so
in
president
polk's
message,
declaring
war
on
mexico,
a
year
or
so
after
its
annexation,
said
the
regress
of
the
wrongs
of
citizens
naturally
and
in
separative
mends
itself
with
the
question
of
boundary.
your
settlement
to
one
question
and
correct
you
to
subject
involves
out
of
the
other
and
then
this.
the
congress
of
texas,
by
act
of
december
19th,
1836,
had
declared
the
rio
--
rio
del
norte
to
be
the
boundary
of
texas
and
this
message
of
war
he
referred
to
this
very
act,
solicitor
says
(inaudible),
as
far
as
the
maritime
boundary.
and
he
says
the
couple
of
full
variance
has
been
exhausted.
and
he
goes
on
and
he
says
that
mexico
has
invaded
american
territory
and
shed
american
blood
on
american
soil.
thomas
jefferson
green,
who
was
the
author
of
the
act
in
the
texas
congress,
records
that
he
later
on
discussed
this
with
--
with
president
polk
and
said
president
polk
had
little
out
of
legal
international
rights
to
the
bank
of
rio
grande.
he
complimented
me
for
my
happy
thought
and
being
the
author
of
said
law
and
said
without
it,
he
never
would
have
move
up
to
that
line.
now,
we
come
to
guadalupe
hidalgo
at
the
end
of
that
war.
and
again,
we
say
this
is
an
act
of
foreign
policy
that
is
absolutely
controlled
of
everything
else
in
the
case.
polk
had
written
to
sly
bell
who
was
his
first
agent
to
negotiate
the
mexican
boundary
claims
that
he
should
follow
this
act
and
he
identified
it
by
name
and
date
of
everything.
and
then
he
appointed
to
mr.
trist
who
is
the
chief
clerk
of
state
department
to
negotiate
guadalupe
hidalgo.
and
he
instructed
trist
that
he
was
to
prevail
upon
the
mexicans
to
agree
to
the
line
established
by
the
1836
texas
act.
and
then
the
texas
legislature
passed
a
resolution
instructing
their
senators
as
follows,
that
our
senators
be
further
instructed
to
oppose
any
treaty
with
mexico,
which
may
provide
for
resting
the
boundaries
of
texas
as
establish
by
an
act
to
finally
bound
of
texas
approved
december
19th,
1836.
and
article
5
of
the
treaty
resulted.
and
it
says
that
the
dividing
line
between
the
two
republics
shall
commence
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
three
leagues
from
land
and
further
from
rio
--
rio
bravo.
now,
on
that,
i
want
to
join
issue
with
the
government
on
what
they
say
about
that
act.
they
say
that
act
just
goes
out.
it
doesn't
bother
anything.
now,
any
lawyer
knows
that
a
boundary
divides
territory.
if
it
doesn't
divide
territory,
it's
not
a
boundary,
just
an
act
sticking
out
there.
this
is
something
why
you
just
make
a
tight
rope,
walk
out
and
back
and
you
can't
step
off
either
sides.
and
we
say
that
they
had
a
good
reason
for
putting
out
there.
the
reason
was
that
the
texas
boundary
was
out
there
and
polk
knew
it,
he'd
referred
to
it
constantly,
he
had
instructed
his
men
to
follow
it
and
he
did
follow
it.
and
he
went
out
and
tied
on
to
a
corner.
he
tied
onto
the
corner
of
the
texas
boundary
act.
now,
boundary
has
to
close.
a
boundary
just
doesn't
go
sticking
out
there,
it
has
to
close.
and
--
and
he
closed
it
by
this.
and
we
say
that's
inclusive
of
the
government's
case
that
the
--
that
united
states
adopted
and
--
and
put
into
effect
the
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf.
and
if
you
look
into
foreign
policy,
you
look
to
the
president's
declarations,
his
messages
to
congress,
you
look
to
his
declarations
of
war,
and
you
look
to
the
treaties
approved
by
the
senate.
and
there
you
find
the
foreign
policy
and
it's
a
three-league
boundary
for
texas
and
the
gulf.
mr.
james
p.
hart
no,
sir.
all
of
this
is
documented.
it's
all
historical.
mr.
james
p.
hart
well,
if
you're
free
with
your
interpretation
of
judicial
knowledge,
the
best
historical
work
on
this,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
on
the
annexation.
if
i
--
professor
justin
h.
smith
of
--
of
document
of
congress,
and
he
has
made
a
detailed
study
and
a
very
accurate
and
documented
study
of
this
whole
subject
of
annexation.
that's
very
good.
now,
if
you
can
take
judicial
knowledge
of
that
kind
of
history,
there's
no
--
there
can
be
no
argument
about
how
you
prove
the
facts.
now,
the
very
step
in
the
negotiation
of
this
treaty
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
mr.
james
p.
hart
well,
we
--
we
say
that
--
that
our
facts
we
think
are
so
conclusive
that
we
--
that
--
that
if
we
were
in
the
district
court,
we
would
be
entitled
to
instruct
the
first,
but
we're
not
certainly
entitled
to
a
back
line
on
this
question
of
foreign
policy
of
facts.
mr.
james
p.
hart
it's
been
so
long
since
we
made
a
prayer,
your
honor.
i
forgot.
i
--
i
think
--
i
don't
remember.
[laughs]
mr.
james
p.
hart
he's
starting
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
he
makes
it
now
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
--
but
we
hadn't
made
it
before,
we'll
make
it
now.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
james
p.
hart
all
the
books
in
the
library,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes.
now,
in
--
in
this
--
i
want
to
point
out
--
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
that's
right.
i
can
only
speak
or
texas.
mr.
james
p.
hart
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
any
oral
testimony.
now,
the
very
step
in
the
negotiation
of
the
treaty
show
that
they
were
going
out
to
a
line
and
tying
on
to
a
line.
mexico
proposed
three
leagues
off
of
the
nueces
river.
in
other
words,
their
proposal
wasn't
to
come
to
nueces
river
and
go
out
three
leagues.
united
states
opposed
three
leagues
off
of
the
rio
grande
river
and
they
were
going
out
to
tie
onto
a
line,
that
line
was
this
texas
boundary
act
that
everybody
knew
about.
now,
i
want
to
read
a
brief
with
this
british
protest,
and
i
don't
--
we
--
we
differ
sharply
with
the
solicitor's
construction
of
that
british
protest.
we
say
that
strengthens
our
case.
and
here
is
the
direct
language
of
that
protest,
“i've
been
directed,”
this
is
the
british,
“i've
been
directed
the
state,
united
states
government
that
in
order
to
prevent
future
misunderstanding,
her
majesty's
government
think
it
right
to
declare
that
they
cannot
acquiescence
in
the
extent
of
maritime
jurisdiction
assumed
by
the
united
states
and
mexico
in
the
article
in
question.”
and
here
is
the
reply
from
buchanan,
secretary
of
state,
“in
answer,
i
have
to
state
the
stipulations
the
treaty
can
only
affect
the
rights
of
mexico
and
united
states
if,
for
their
mutual
convenience,
it
has
been
deemed
proper
to
enter
into
such
an
arrangement,
third
parties
can
have
no
just
cause
of
complaint."
the
government
of
the
united
states
never
intended
by
this
stipulation
the
question
of
the
rights
that
great
britain
or
any
other
power
may
possess
under
the
law
of
nations.
now,
we
say
that
that's
a
positive
statement
of
the
foreign
policy
of
united
states
that
there
wasn't
a
three-league
limitation
in
the
--
in
the
gulf,
because
had
there
been,
they
would
have
been
questioning
by
putting
this
into
treaty.
and
they
have
replied
over
protest
that
this
treaty
did
not
violate
britain's
rights
and
then
in
spite
of
that
protest,
they
went
ahead
and
put
it
in
the
treaty,
and
they
put
it
in
the
gadsden
purchase,
and
they
put
it
in
all
these
boundary
commissions
down
through
the
year
since
then.
and
we
say
that
that
protest
absolutely
nails
down
the
texas
case
that
in
response
to
a
protest
from
a
foreign
power,
they
insisted
on
that
clause
in
the
treaty
and
kept
it
and
replied
to
britain
that
it
was
no
concern
of
yours.
now,
one
good
reason
that
that
reply
was
good
was
that
when
texas
was
recognized
by
great
britain
back
in
1837,
a
copy
of
the
texas
boundary
act
had
been
served
on
britain
at
the
time,
and
this
was
some
12
to
14
years
later.
and
they
had
never
protest
that
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
nation
protested
the
texas
boundary
act.
mr.
james
p.
hart
mr.
gadsden
--
yes,
sir,
it
was.
mr.
james
p.
hart
they
do,
they
assert
that
and
are
maintaining
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
there
now.
i
am
apparent
most
cannot
go
in
there,
although
the
state
department
has
protested.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
that's
in
their
argument.
yes,
sir.
now,
there's
one
other
matter
i
want
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court.
congress
authorized
the
publication
of
a
document
entitled
“boundaries,
areas,
geographical
centers
and
--
and
altitude
of
united
states
and
several
states”.
and
that
said
the
area
which
texas
brought
into
the
union
was
limited
as
--
as
follows
as
defined
by
the
republic
of
texas
december
19th,
1836
and
then
it
says
“beginning
at
the
mouth
of
sabine
river
and
running
west
along
the
gulf,
three
leagues
from
land
to
the
place
of
--
to
the
mouth
of
rio
grande”.
and
then
i
call
your
attention
again
to
the
state
department
map
on
page
111
of
the
texas
brief
which
has
recognized
it.
so
we
say
that
--
we
think
we've
absolutely
nailed
it
down.
and
i
don't
see
how
the
court
could
find
that
boundary
strongly.
when
the
commissioners
who
negotiate
with
the
annexation
were
told
to
insist
on
that
boundary,
when
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
--
in
effort
to
pass
it,
assured
sam
houston
that
the
boundary
would
be
respected.
when
they
came
in,
when
they
went
to
war
over
a
portion
of
that
boundary
and
in
the
war
message
identified
the
act
and
--
and
when
the
president
in
a
message
says,
“this
is
the
texas.”
and
then
when
the
president
in
a
treaty
with
the
foreign
nation
instructed
its
negotiator
to
incorporate
that
boundary
into
the
treaty
and
it
was
incorporated
and
it
stayed
there
over
a
protest.
we
think
that
the
strong
case
of
foreign
policies
you
could
possibly
make.
now,
on
the
negative
side,
we
say,
we
--
we
say
to
this,
that
the
solicitor
has
not
done
a
single
piece
of
evidence
before
1855.
it
says,
as
a
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
that
no
nation
can
go
beyond
three
miles.
we
just
hadn't
got
it.
the
first
time
that
united
states
asserted
that
no
nations
go
beyond
three
miles
of
1855.
we
say
that
jefferson's
letter
stated
exact
contrary.
jefferson's
letter
said,
“we're
asserting
a
three-mile
minimum,
and
the
nations
can
go
further
and
we
are
reserving
a
right
to
go
further.”
and
that
was
the
foreign
policy.
and
so
we
say
that
the
texas
act
was
in
--
in
constants
with
and
in
harmony
with
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
and
it
was
so
intended
to
be
and
it
was.
and
--
and
we
say
further
that
there's
no
three-league
at
that
time.
we
prepared
a
table
on
the
general
international
law,
which
appears
in
the
back
of
our
--
our
book
which
cites
some
100
odd
parts
to
the
fact
that
at
that
time,
a
three-league
boundary
was
permissible
boundary.
under
the
circumstances,
we
feel
like
that
--
that
texas
is
entitled
to
judge
from
this
case.
mr.
james
p.
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
hart
the
act
means
that
--
and
that
all
the
--
all
the
record
therefrom,
as
you
pointed
out
to
us
is
one
way
on
that
being
the
fact,
why
did
congress
leave
it
to
the
court
to
determine,
what
was
left
to
determine
by
congress?
well,
your
honor
--
