justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
one
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
who
declares
or
is
there
any
person
or
one
departmental
official
who
has
the
power
to
declare
the
governmental
policy?
is
it
limited
to
the
secretary
of
the
state?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
congress
itself,
then
in
the
passage
of
this
joint
resolution
pertain
in
1953
declare
the
public
policy
of
this
country
on
this
question
as
respects
national
sovereignty
in
the
gulf?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
may
it
have
to
be
a
state
--
have
a
boundary
only
in
the
subsoil
and
seabeds,
not
including
overriding
waters?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
neither
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
neither
could
the
united
states
have
had
to
outer
limit
of
the
continental
shelf
prior
to
the
presidential
proclamation
in
1945.
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
mean
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
continental
shelf.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
it
is
by
virtue
of
that
proclamation
as
codified
in
this
--
by
congress
in
this
joint
resolution
13,
that
the
united
states
bases
its
claim
to
the
seabeds
and
subsoils
and
minerals
therein,
to
the
outer
limit
of
the
continental
shelf
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
the
basis
upon
which
rests
the
claim
of
the
states
through
the
quitclaim
of
resolution
13.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
i
mean
that's
what
--
that's
talking
about
resolution
13.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
united
states
acquires
its
claim
of
a
right
under
the
presidential
proclamation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
codified
by
this
joint
resolution
13.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then
what
i'm
in
doubt
about
and
would
like
to
know,
is
did
the
presidential
proclamation
if
it
alone
created
this
extension
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
continental
shelf,
give
to
this
country
a
territorial
limit
to
that
far
at
sea?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
not
--
i
may
misunderstand,
but
do
i
correctly
or
incorrectly
understand
that
the
states
or
at
least
some
of
them
here
argue
that
such
is
their
basis
as
well,
namely
that
they
claim
only
in
the
seabeds
and
subsoil
and
not
in
overriding
waters.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
coextensive?
you
don't,
as
i
understand
it,
mean
that
they
must
be
coextensive
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
but
rather
only
that
the
states
may
not
exceed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor
general
did
you
mean
--
may
i
ask
this
question.
are
you
in
dispute
with
any
your
adversaries
here
over
the
meaning
of
the
word,
boundaries
as
used
in
these
cases?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
now,
you're
talking
about
where
it
is
as
a
line.
are
you
in
dispute
over
the
meaning
of
the
word?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it
may
assumed
--
one
more
question,
please.
arguendo,
that
it
has
consistently
been
the
policy
of
our
country
to
maintain
only
and
to
permit
others
to
maintain
only,
a
marginal
belt
of
three
miles,
until
at
least,
congress
passed
this
act
in
1953.
and
assume
that
this
is
a
political
question
still
this
court
would
to
ascertain
the
fact
would
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
having
ascertained
what
is
the
national
maritime
boundary,
as
maintained
by
the
state
over
the
years,
the
court
cannot
touch
it,
it
being
a
political
question,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
now
then,
but
if
in
1953
congress
changed
it
as
respects
these
states
in
the
gulf
to
an
extent
of
three
miles
and
so
much
further
as
the
states
can
show,
was
within
their
boundaries
at
the
time
they
were
admitted
to
the
union,
wouldn't
this
court
have
the
right
to
declare
that
fact?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
believe
you
have
both
retained
the
past
sentence.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
at
the
time
such
case
became
a
number.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
your
construction
is
it
means
just
actually,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
--
nobody's
writing
the
books.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
in
boundaries
good
necessarily
being
nothing
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
everything
about
this
concludes
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
how
do
you
try
to
(inaudible)
that
the
united
states
have
enough
--
didn't
anything
(inaudible)
beyond
three
miles
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
you
--
you
(inaudible)
define
that
president
proclamation
further
rights
to
the
continental
shelf
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it
comes
within
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
so
much
more,
must
be
easily
used
as
you
construe
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
(inaudible)
where
was
then
the
boundaries
of
the
states
at
the
time
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
it
claim
more
(inaudible)
you
don't
claim
more
than
the
amount
but
as
--
as
a
(inaudible)
now,
did
the
states
claim
more?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
the
boundary
of
both,
if
you
have
just
one
(inaudible)
but
the
united
states
has
some
(inaudible)
to
be
taken?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
only
this
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
argued
they
can.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
first?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
certainly.
it
gave
you
three
miles
and
so
much
more.
how
(inaudible)
improved,
first
you
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
or
they
did
not
to
be
grant
anything
more
than
we
must,
a
fit
for
the
formula
on
this
issue.
they
didn't
--
the
states
couldn't
by
proving
your
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
noticed
that
you
used
--
had
used
several
times
the
word,
“historical
boundaries.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
didn't
claim
that
used
in
the
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
language
respective
of
the
granting
clause
of
section
2.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
just
(inaudible)
on
the
act,
in
your
judgment
to
read
in
the
words
immediately
existed,
immediately
before
or
beginning
to
read
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
congress
if
it's
more
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
same
as
it
was
or
as
--
or
as
their
act
were
approved
by
congress.
the
magnitude
(inaudible)
of
the
case
being
approved
by
congress
in
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
not
limited
to
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
is
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
unless
that's
done
by
the
presence
of
the
words,
existed
at
the
time
of.
that
might
be
a
limitation,
existed
at
that
time
as
the
boundaries
existed
at
the
time
of
the
state
was
a
member
of
the
union.
was
not
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
say
the
record
with
reference
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
understand
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
make
this
certain
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
is
that
to
say
that
the
territorial
--
i
hate
to
use
the
word
boundaries,
but,
jurisdiction
and
power
of
the
state
shall
extend
so
far
as
rights
in
the
submerged
lands
extend,
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
the
attorney
--
the
solicitor
general
as
i
understand
him
said,
“the
states
cannot
have
a
boundary
seaward
of
the
national
boundary.
the
national
boundary
is
limited
to
three
miles.
now,
you
say,
that
your
rights
granted
by
congress
extend
beyond
that
period,
but
only
under
the
water.
now,
is
that
your
--
what
you're
saying?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
whose
gulf?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gremillion
--
mr.
gremillion,
may
i
ask
you
please?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
believe
that
you
--
that
these
states
which
were
territories
can
question
areas
not
embraced
within
their
territorial
areas?
are
they
limited
by
the
areas
embraced
within
their
territories?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
accepting
your
view
of
the
phrase,
“boundaries
existing
at
the
time
of
admission
to
the
union.”
there
could
be
no
competent
evidence
to
prove
the
necessary
fact,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
--
if
it
is
true
that
historically
--
consistently
down
until
at
least
the
time
of
this
act,
that
the
three-mile
limit
was
effective
so
far
as
we're
concerned.
then
if
the
phrase,
“boundaries
existing
at
the
time
of
admission
to
the
state,”
means
immediately
after
admitted
to
the
state,
then
how
could
there
be
competent
evidence
that
the
--
now
that
the
states'
boundaries
at
the
time
existed
beyond
three
miles?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
do
i
understand,
consistently
used
the
description
you
have
just
given?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
meaning,
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
thence,
along
the
gulf,
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
moment
our
--
have
i
misunderstood
you?
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
descriptions
used
in
the
--
the
act
creating
the
territory
that
and
also
in
the
constitution
and
in
the
act
of
admission,
you
began
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
and
came
back
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
then
saying
bounded
by
said
gulf
of
mexico,
commonly
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
this
--
of
the
shore?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
none
of
those
descriptions
then
contain
any
direct
reference
to
an
extension
of
the
boundary
into
the
sea
except
as
maybe
implied
or
expressed
by
the
phrase,
“including
all
islands,”
isn't
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
would
that
do
in
this
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
they
were
writing
the
law
--
they
were
writing
the
law
at
those
times.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
but
they
make
the
grant
which
section
2
convey
to
the
kind
of
bond,
boundaries
as
they
existed
at
the
time
the
states
with
the
pleasure
to
be
used
or
as
such
was
used
by
them.
now,
if
that
means
just
after
(inaudible)
then
your
argument
of
the
historic
three-mile
limit
has
force.
but
if
it
means
as
the
state
declares
that
just
before
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
then
just
--
was
--
was
it
not,
and
offer
to
--
a
conveyance
to
the
state
to
the
extent
that
they
could
prove
their
historic
boundaries
extended
seaward
and
not
exceeding
over
three
leagues,
and
at
the
same
time,
a
congressional
approval
of
a
new
seaward
boundary
for
the
country.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
as
to
the
question,
i
can't
find
that
where
the
descriptions
under
this
louisiana
(inaudible)
say
including
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
forgers
advised
that
government
including
all
islands,
included
in
three
leagues.
what
does
that
mean?
that
the
scope
or
we
--
we
have
to
fix
with
this,
are
we
just
to
use
that
(inaudible)
with
the
shore?
does
it
have
to
(inaudible)
with
the
coast?
i
just
don't
know
--
i
think
you
mean
we
have
--
if
we
accept
your
view
that
it
does
not
include
a
seaward
boundary
extending
seaward
of
all
(inaudible)
then
have
to
examine
where
to
begin
to
decide
what
islands
are
existing.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
and
that
landward
is
in
the
water
or
do
you
claim
that
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
why
(inaudible)
and
they
are
inland
shoreward
of
the
islands
and
therefore
inland
waters
(inaudible)
including
all
islands.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
construe
it
to
be
between
the
gulfs.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)

charles

whittaker
where
is
the

south
(inaudible)
justice
charles

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
--
no.
not
just
so
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
price,
do
you
understand
with
reference
to
section
2,
you
within
this
(inaudible)
waters
to
uphold
stroke
of
the
breadth
of
the
--
your
southern
ground
boundaries?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
does
that
cover
the
whole
distance
both
in
east
and
west
of
your
state?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
a
concession?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
the
government's
concession?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
the
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
understand
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
words
i
think
was
dependent
once
of
that
territory.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
before
you
read
that,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
swarth.
(inaudible)
is
concerned
that
the
act
march
3,
1845
giving
floridas
to
(inaudible)
is
contained
the
descriptions
of
its
territories
in
place,
the
territories
of
east
and
west
florida
which
by
the
treaty
amity,
settlement,
and
limits
was
treated
to
the
united
states?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
that
treaty
given
there
--
there
was
embraced
"the
adjacent
islands
dependent
on
said
province.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
something
more
was
embraced
in
that
treaty
than
just
mainland.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
did
the
--
florida
then
did
consist
of
something
more
than
named
as
it
was
originally
admitted
to
the
union.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
is
it
your
understanding
or
do
you
--
you
argue,
i
suppose
now
that
the
1868
constitution
expanded,
did
it,
the
florida
territory?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
one
more
question
if
i
may
to
this.
does
your
view
with
respect
to
florida's
republic
in
view
of
the
islands
dependent
upon
the
said
province,
involve
a
marginal
sea
of
three
miles
surrounding
each
island?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
the
three-league
adoption
by
the
1868
constitution
expand
florida's
territory
or
may
attempt
to?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
on
the
physical
examination
and
survey.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
states
were
(inaudible)
to
representation
in
the
congress.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
default
or
how,
by
non
action?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
as
a
predicate
to
the
right
of
the
states
to
do
so,
they
were
required
to
submit
new
constitutions.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
they
were
required
to
be
