mr.
gordon
madison
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
alabama
has
two
pleadings
you
might
say
which
have
been
filed
in
the
court,
which
do
not
pertain
to
the
other
states
and
before
i
go
into
the
argument
proper,
i
believe
it's
well
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
those
are.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes
sir.
we
were
in
a
measure,
invited
by
the
court
after
texas
filed
a
pertinent
proceeding
of
the
brief
here
in
which
it
asked
the
court
not
to
bother
texas
in
the
louisiana
case
if
it
decided
it
to
come
in
and
intervene.
alabama
didn't
have
any
oral
aperture
at
that
time
and
doesn't
have
any
now.
and
if
we
had
to
wait
until
the
united
states
sued
us
in
order
to
determine
what
our
rights
were
at
that,
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have
ever
known,
because
there's
no
assurance
that
we
never
had
oil,
although
we
do
have
a
number
of
oil
wells
which
have
since
been
discovered
in
the
baldwin
and
mobile
county
areas.
that
took
the
form
of
intervention
by
the
state
of
alabama
with
the
supporting
brief.
after
that,
the
united
states
amended
by
making
all
of
the
defendant
states
parties
respondent.
to
that,
alabama
filed
a
short
answer
and
the
brevity
of
these
things
in
the
--
the
strength
of
alabama's
claim
rather
than
the
lack
of
it.
it's
about
two
or
three
pages.
we
made
that
a
cross
bill.
in
my
ordinary
practice,
if
the
united
states
had
not
been
involved,
i
would
most
certainly
have
had
a
cross
bill.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
submerged
lands
act
impliedly,
if
not
expressly,
authorized
the
state
to
file
something
to
determine
what
they
had.
but
in
any
event,
the
government
concedes
that
alabama
can
have
just
as
much
as
anybody
else
under
his
answer
without
the
cross
bill,
if
it
can
prove
it.
so
rather
inject
that
issue
into
this
case
for
whether
we
can
sue
the
united
states
or
not,
based
on
the
government's
concession
to
us
on
that
point,
we
do
not
insist
on
the
cross
bill.
next
thing
we
filed
was
a
brief
for
the
state
of
alabama
in
our
position
to
the
government's
motion
for
judgment.
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
that
is
what
is
pending
here
today.
we
haven't
tried
this
case.
we
haven't
introduced
any
evidence.
we
haven't
done
anything,
except
appear
here
in
response
to
a
motion
which
has
been
filed
by
the
united
states
asking
for
a
judgment.
subsequent
to
that,
there
has
been
some
changes
in
our
administration,
former
attorney
general
has
become
governor.
and
one
of
our
former
assistant
attorney
general
has
become
attorney
general.
there
are
difference
in
the
governor's
legal
advisers
and
the
head
of
the
conservation
department
and
they
wanted
to
be
in
some
sort
of
way,
so
i
figured
out
that
i
would
make
what
i
call
a
written
memorial
and
i
want
to
say
that
memorial
can
refer
to
a
tombstone
of
a
graveyard,
and
i'm
not
submitting
in
that
sense
that
alabama
case
is
going
to
be
bad,
but
it's
a
written
memorial
of
the
oral
argument
of
necessity.
of
--
of
course,
the
court
knows
that
i
didn't
intend
to
read
it.
mr.
gordon
madison
it
does,
yes
sir.
and
some
of
these
foreign
policy
claims
which
i
thought
had
been
settled
by
the
question
from
the
court
to
those
preceding
me,
but
i
find
it
every
time
this
distinguished
gentleman
gets
up,
it
pops
up
again.
so,
i
--
i
don't
think
i'll
even
attempt
to
answer
that
except
in
this
way.
i
can
see
the
gentleman
and
all
the
senate
and
house
now.
and
by
the
way,
at
this
point,
i
want
to
say
that
my
two
distinguished
senators
were
in
full
opposition
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
we're
fighting
at
every
step.
if
they
had
been
for
it,
the
record
would
have
been
full
of
alabama's
claim
just
like
you
find
for
texas
and
for
florida.
now,
they
went
out
there
as
i
believe
and
said
we
just
gave
right
to
texas
and
florida
into
this
thing,
and
we'll
pass.
but
we'll
get
us
up
a
formula
or
a
criteria
and
i
understand
that
they
send
it
over
to
the
justice
department
to
get
help
on
framing
that
language.
so
that
we
will
make
it
almost
foolproof
as
far
as
texas
and
florida
are
concerned,
we're
writing
here
prior
to
take
care
of
texas
or
it
approved
by
congress,
subsequently
approved
by
congress
to
take
care
of
florida
when
it
would
have
made
it
later
as
a
rebel
state
and
any
generality,
we
let
everybody
else
come
in
that
can
prove
a
boundary
to
take
care
of
the
(inaudible).
but
when
they
got
that,
they
got
it
fast.
well
i
submit
that
the
congress
did
not
place,
it
did
not
place
in
alabama's
hand
or
anybody
else's
hand,
a
yardstick
which
struck
the
one
foot
the
moment
we
call
all
to
it
to
measure
our
rights.
and
the
one
foot
had
got
--
it's
comparable
to
the
three
geographical
marks.
as
i
understand
the
government's
contention,
that
although
we'll
give
him
a
right
to
prove
it,
we
can.
now,
i
say
it
that
although
the
act
may
not
be
meaningless,
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
that
sense,
if
his
contention
is
correct
that
we
cannot
make
proof
even
though
we've
got
proof,
we
can
make
it
because
of
some
so-called
three-mile
rule,
and
then
there
are
clear
agreements.
the
congress
has
done
a
futile
thing.
now
outside
of
that,
he
says
you're
bound.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
am
glad
you
brought
that
up,
sir.
and
if
we
--
if
we're
going
to
--
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
that
a
little
bit,
i
believe
you'll
find
although
he
had
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
that
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
took
the
side
that
congress
can
give
one
state
more
than
it
can
give
us.
fair
to
the
brief
is
devoted
to
it,
so
both
of
us
better
forget
that.[laughter]
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
you
mean,
your
honor,
it
is
a
reply
in
kind?[laughter]
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
i
don't
believe
this
court
is
going
to
hold
that
in
the
statement,
but
made
by
our
attorney
general
at
that
time,
because
their
position
changed
depending
on
which
side
political
offenses
might
be
on.
can
trigger
by
alabama's
boundaries
or
--
or
bind
them,
we
couldn't
get
in,
in
court
with
that
case.
and
we
used
practically
the
same
argument
that
government
is
using
now.
now,
if
you
all
take
the
government's
argument
now
as
we
get
in
court
that
takes
us
out,
at
least
that's
unfortunate.[laughter]
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
you
--
you'll
notice
in
this
--
and
we'll
try
to
get
down
to
them
to
my
case
now.
you'll
notice
in
its
memorandum
which
are
filed
here,
the
memorial,
i
refer
to
various
wards.
i
don't
want
to
take
that
up
except
to
say
that
the
idea
in
referring
to
the
court's
expression
in
johnson
versus
m'intosh
in
8
wheat.
that's
a
contest
between
the
cabinets
over
a
sale
and
matters
respecting
in
the
territory
on
the
northern
coast
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
were
fierce
and
bloody.
and
then
the
war,
it
came
with
--
with
england
and
spain
and
france,
being
fought
them.
and
after
that,
i
think
about
1780,
spain
fought
england
and
got
west
florida
back,
all
of
florida
for
that
matter.
then
our
historians
said
that
spain
then
control
the
whole
gulf
coast.
and
after
that,
we
show
the
--
the
war
of
1812.
we
show
the
proclamation
of
president
madison
who
ordered
general
raperson
(ph)
to
take
mobile
--
gun
boats
were
off
mobile
bay
then.
the
spaniards
were
still
in
possession.
during
that
war
of
1812,
they've
allowed
the
florida
forced
to
be
used
by
the
british,
so
jackson
when
he
finished
it
then,
he
went
on
down
and
stands
(inaudible)
took
that
and
he
came
on
back
and
went
to
new
orleans
and
they
fought
the
battle
in
new
orleans.
in
the
meantime,
british
made
attacked
on
one
of
our
ports
out
there,
(inaudible).
but
even
as
late
as
1815,
when
they
were
retreating
from
the
(inaudible)
mississippi,
they
attacked
at
the
port
again
and
captured
it.
when
i
enumerate
those
statement,
i
am
not
having
a
low
for
it.
i
enumerate
them
because
it
seems
to
me
and
on
the
unsettled
condition
at
that
period,
during
those
periods,
with
no
declared
boundary
from
the
national
standpoint
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
that
those
different
wars
showed
that
each
nation
demanded
for
its
own
security,
a
greater
wit
than
three
miles.
now,
the
next
thing
i'll
show
is
the
dispute
with
spain.
i
realize
this
court
says
he
got
--
that
he
got
west
florida,
that
portion
which
is
pertinent
to
alabama
and
mississippi
through
the
louisiana
purchase,
but
it
did
so
because
that
congress
had
determined
that
and
you're
bound
by
--
looked
like
he'd
be
bound
with
some
congress
done
by
the
submerged
lands
act
too.
but
anyhow,
i
don't
know
whether
if
you
have
called
upon
to
decide
that
straight
question,
you
say
is
enough.
again,
monroe
and
he
went
through
a
pass
in
1804
and
he
--
he
directed
the
communication
of
(inaudible)
under
the
french
minister
of
exterior
relations
setting
forth
our
claim
on
louisiana
purchase
and
he
replied
in
decided
terms
so
our
case
is
there.
the
case
of
foster
versus
neilson,
decided
terms
that
with
all
the
negotiations
between
france
and
spain
that
no
part
of
the
florida
neither
west
or
east,
was
conveyed
or
granted,
or
by
the
cession
to
france
by
spain.
and
that
gave
rise
to
dispute.
now,
we
allowed
the
spanish
to
stay
in
possession,
it
was
regarded
under
the
louisiana
fort.
and
we
actually
didn't
get
possession
of
that
territory
in
the
sense
that
we
could
have
physical
possession
of
it,
until
our
set
battle
of
new
orleans.
now,
i
--
i
don't
have
any
law
for
this
either,
it
was
the
kind
of
rule
of
commerce
stamped
in
either
way.
i
don't
know
hope
too
much
within
natural
law.
what
can
you
project
into
the
area
of
that
kind?
the
foreign
policy
of
three
miles
when
it's
subject
to
dispute
and
which
president
madison
said
when
he
sees
it
that
he's
going
to
hold
it
subject
to
friendly
or
just
settlement.
while
in
this
to
great
britain,
he
wrote
to
why
did
you
incorporate
that
territory
when
you
said
you're
going
to
hold
it,
subject
to
friendly
settlement
dispute.
and
it
was
a
pretty
difficult
question
to
answer.
in
fact,
i
didn't
find
the
answer
from
united
states
government
to
it.
now,
getting
down
--
too
much
for
those
preliminary
things,
now
getting
down
to
alabama's
description
which
i
think
is
the
crux
of
this
case
as
far
as
we
are
concerned.
on
page
3
--
now
this
little
yellow
brief,
is
our
description.
he
said
that
the
states
here
consist
of
all
the
territory
included
within
the
foreign
boundaries
and
then
gets
down
to
the
part
that
we
run
due
south
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
thence
eastwardly,
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore
to
the
perdido
river.
now,
this
is
the
(inaudible).
this
is
the
alabama-mississippi
line,
over
here.
and
over
here
is
this
florida-alabama
line
and
here
is
your
perdido
river.
from
this
point
on,
the
coast
over
here,
running
from
(inaudible)
over
here
is
the
perdido
river,
the
coast
and
the
shore
are
the
same.
over
here,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
what
place
you
get
your
feet
wet
is
right
up
here.
now,
we
say
that's
the
shore.
we
have
two
lines
drawn,
i'll
explain
to
you
where
they
go.
we
got
one
that
shows
six
leagues
from
shore
running
parallel
and
we
got
one
that
shows
six
leagues
from
coast
running
parallel.
now,
the
british
description
when
king
of
britain
devised
it
and
described
it
the
first
time,
he
described
an
area,
six
leagues
from
coast
and
said
it
run
from
the
river
apalachicola
in
florida
to
lake
pontchartrain
in
louisiana,
so
we
are
a
segment
of
that
description.
and
our
--
our
state
at
this
point
when
he
asked
about
proof,
if
that
thought
of
our
chain
of
title,
i
don't
know
whether
we
need
to
go
back,
and
we
don't
unless
the
court
takes
care
of
it,
if
you
do,
i
think
i
need
to
find
out
what
they
were
talking
about
waters
along
that
coast
during
1763,
as
well
as
what
might
be
there
when
we
admitted
to
union,
because
we
are
a
segment
of
that
description.
now,
the
distance
from
the
shore,
the
petit
bois
islands
and
the
district
from
the
shore,
the
dolphin
island
which
is
referred
the
distance
that
you
can
get
from
shore
to
an
island
is
less
than
three
leagues.
it's
2.86
in
one
case
and
2.87
in
the
other.
you
will
notice
that
all
of
these
phase
that
we've
had
here,
as
i
understand
the
rule,
are
less
than
six
miles
and
that
rule
is,
you
measure
from
headland
to
headland,
so
we
come
around
here
for
our
shoreline,
come
on
down
and
in
gulf
coast
here
with
shoreline
and
gone
over
to
the
mouth
of
the
perdido
river.
now,
for
our
--
mr.
gordon
madison
(inaudible)
what
i
gather
that
the
--
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
madison
now
we
will
run
way
up
in
mobile
bay
into
our
shoreline,
because
of
the
rule,
none
of
our
bays
are
--
are
six
--
six
miles,
over
six
miles
--
mr.
gordon
madison
right.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
we
hadn't
--
but
--
but
i
don't
believe
i
think
what
did
you
--
approximately
80
miles,
but
it
doesn't
come
here.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
correct.
now,
here's
what
i'd
take
the
government
has
conceded.
now,
i
think
they
had
conceded.
i
don't
think
they
were
doing
alabama
a
favor
when
they
conceded.
i
think
it
was
because
this
court
has
decided
beyond
any
question
that
mississippi
found
with
inland
water
and
everything
under
it,
pass
to
the
--
in
the
mississippi
case
which
was
considered.
we're
talking
about
the
same
mississippi
south,
passed
in
mississippi
on
this
description,
and
therefore,
it
was
inland
water.
and
i
think
what
he
means
to
concede
is
that
we're
come
here
to
the
coast
--
i
think
this
is
the
coast
line
he
talked
about.
we're
on
--
right
on
here
--
right
on
this
dolphin
island
here,
come
on
out
here
around
these
islands.
this
is
a
pelican
and
these
are
not
little
pelicans
in
here,
they
are
the
west
sand,
and
(inaudible)
are
going
back
and
going
around.
i
think
that's
what
he
concedes.
anything
inshore
of
that,
he
concedes
the
wrong.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir.
not
only
that.
i
think
he
concedes
that
we
asked
you
three
geographical
miles
out
from
that
line
and
he
concedes
to
be
the
coastline.
now,
he
can't
get
a
coastline
back
at
the
mobile
bay.
he
can
get
one
off
inshore
of
gulf
and
islands
throughout
taking
the
--
the
smallest
coastline
that
you
can
get.
in
other
words,
i'm
giving
advantage
to
the
government.
i
am
not
taking
a
line
where
i
get
somewhere.
i
am
just
going
here
until
you
get
water
on
the
other
side
of
these
islands.
now,
let's
get
to
our
description.
he
says
it
wouldn't
been
in
a
use
of
views,
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore.
well,
maybe
not.
i'd
say
that
too.
but
the
point
he
overlooks
is
by
using
that
this
court
has
got
to
give
some
meaning
to
it.
if
without
using,
we
have
got
all
the
islands,
then
by
using
it
what
does
it
mean?
if
all
of
the
islands,
and
this
is
a
further
point
away
from
shore,
can
be
embraced
within
three
leagues,
then
what
does
the
extra
three
leagues
mean
when
they
say
“in
allowance
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore.”
what
court
will
do
with
more
than
three
leagues?
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i've
got
where
would
this
be
and
they're
right
here.
and
i've
looked
for
hard
places,
shallow
places
under
the
water
and
i
can't
find
it
anymore.
now,
i
don't
have
the
enabling
act
in
a
material
point
set
out,
but
there's
another
provision
in
it
that
i
think
is
material.
by
running
that
line
due
south
here,
it
--
it
imprinted
on
three
counties
of
mississippi,
jackson,
greene
and
wayne.
and
they
provided
that
if
it
did
that,
surveyor
should
finally
did
--
did
encroach
on
mississippi,
then
they
say
the
line
is
to
run
in
a
direct
line,
that
was
one
south,
from
a
northwest
corner
of
washington
county
to
a
point,
to
a
point
where?
to
a
point
on
the
gulf
of
mexico,
10
miles
east
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
pascagoula.
well,
on
full
mississippi
sound,
as
i
pointed
out,
would
call
mississippi
sound,
which
this
court
said
the
first
map
they
had
was
in
1866.
it
was
known
as
pascagoula
bay.
it
has
never
been
known
to
the
gulf
of
mexico.
so,
when
you
go
to
a
point
on
the
gulf
of
mexico,
i
say
that
means
you
go
beyond
the
gulf
shore
where
the
government
said,
we
stop.
on
the
gulf
shore,
it
doesn't
mean
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
me.
well,
you
ask
the
question
where
is
that
point
there.
where
is
that
point
that
move
the
line?
where
is
that
point
on
the
gulf
of
mexico?
i'd
say
you
find
it
by
going
six
leagues
there,
to
me.
and
when
you
do,
you
got
a
lot
of
boundary
beyond
your
farthest
island.
and
i
have
one
other
point
to
make.
in
this
mississippi
versus
louisiana
case,
201
u.s.,
there
are
a
lot
of
maps
filed
in
that
case.
they
were
not
disputing
over
the
eastern
boundary.
they're
disputing
something
about
the
--
the
right
to
oyster
bed
move
on
a
western
part.
but
the
lawyer
to
that
day
without
any
oral
to
becloud
that
thing,
and
anything
like
that,
they
sat
down
to
consider
where
mississippi
started
westwardly,
the
point.
and
we
start
eastwardly
from
the
same
point.
now,
louisiana
said
and
later
drew
a
map
showing
it,
compiled
from
the
maps
which
it
introduced
in
this
court
in
that
case,
that
mississippi
started
westwardly
from
a
point
which
is
18
miles
south
of
these
coastlines.
well
now,
know
you
can't
see
this
but
i'm
going
to
leave
it
down.
that
line
was
put
on
there
and
if
it
can
enter
by
any
instruction
by
the
nation's
theory
that
were
drawn
on
that
by
the
culmination
of
the
map
189
1991
preferred
by
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
survey,
the
boundary
line
between
louisiana
and
mississippi
and
duplication
of
exhibit
e
in
the
case
between
louisiana
and
mississippi
and
known
as
the
number
11
original
october
term
1905.
and
they
showed
that
line
out
there
where
we
claim
it
to
be.
there
(inaudible)
you're
talking
about,
that
horn
island
that
you'll
run
into
when
you
leave
these
islands
here.
now,
i
say,
you
didn't
have
an
(inaudible),
you
just
--
you're
talking
about
something
there.
and
the
lawyers
on
that
day
and
i
only
had
good
one,
there's
where
they
drew
that
line,
i
--
i
can't
get
that
up
to
you
now.
what
--
we
--
it's
being
left
with
the
march
--
marshall
whether
you
can
see
it,
if
you
want
to
see.
and
this
particular
map
here
--
mr.
gordon
madison
this
map?
mr.
gordon
madison
it's
(inaudible).
mr.
gordon
madison
it's
made
--
it
has
made
the
--
two
excerpts
from
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
of
the
louisiana
boundary
commission
held
in
new
orleans
in
march
26,
1901.
so,
i
--
i
imagine
they
prepared
it.
now,
i
have
--
this
is
--
there
are
three
or
four
extra
copies
of
it.
i
can
send
of
here
(inaudible)
for
mr.
justice
to
look
at.
they
will
be
left
down
to
the
marshall
for
anybody's
consideration.
now,
i
brought
along
because
the
part
mr.
justice
whittaker
was
talking
about
the
mississippi
sound
is
in
that
gulf
of
mexico.
well,
i
--
that
--
i
don't
like
that.
i
mean
that
hurts
my
argument.[laughter]
i
want
that
studies
much
broad,
that
that
inland
water
has
been
so
flat,
and
i
have
got
map
here
to
show
this
was
called
pascagoula
bay
in
1778,
it
was
called
pascagoula
bay
in
1823,
and
it
was
called
pascagoula
bay
later.
and
then
this
court
said
the
first
map
submitted
to
it,
when
louisiana
versus
mississippi
was
tried
through
which
mississippi
sound
was
called
out
in
1866.
now,
i
submit
--
well
i'd
just
say
it's
simple.
the
equities
to
this
case
called
to
give
here
by
the
same
thing
as
they
--
i
don't
see
the
reason
for
one
state
to
have
three
marine
leagues
submerged
lands
and
many
others
not
to.
sir?
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
have
found
out,
your
honor,
that
(inaudible)
supreme
court
and
we'll
get
just
exactly
what
you
are
saying.
there
won't
be
an
appeal
from
anyway.
and
i
think
i've
given
you
a
reasonable
bases
here
from
which
to
give
alabama
and
applies
to
mississippi
just
well
three
marine
leagues
from
coast.
now,
i
want
to
say
in
conclusion
that
--
and
this
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
either.
well,
it
--
just
don't
make
alabama
the
neglected
child
and
the
happy
gulf
coast
saddened.
thank
you.[laughter]
