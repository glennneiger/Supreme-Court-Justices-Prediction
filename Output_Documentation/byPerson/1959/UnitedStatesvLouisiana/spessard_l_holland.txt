mr.
spessard
l.
holland
mr.
justice
black,
i
so
suggest
to
the
court.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
sorry?
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
the
white
one,
your
honor.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
yes.
yes,
it's
on
the
brief
of
the
state
of
mississippi
in
our
position
to
motion
for
judgment
of
amended
complaint.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
at
the
very
beginning,
although
my
remarks,
of
course,
shall
go
strictly
to
state
of
mississippi,
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
to
a
matter
with
reference
to
the
state
of
texas.
it
was
brought
up
here
in
discussion
by
the
solicitor
general
with
reference
to
the
trist
instruction.
the
best
evidence,
of
course,
is
his
instruction
of
his
--
what
his
instructions
were
well,
what
he
did.
and
the
resulting
treaty
did
not
begin
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
but
began
three
leagues
from
land
and
read
as
follows
citing
the
court
to
page
102
of
the
texas
brief,
“the
boundary
line
between
the
two
republic
shall
commence
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
three
leagues
from
land
opposite
the
rio
grande.”
this
treaty,
of
course,
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
now,
and
it
shows
that
there
is
a
national
boundary
of
three
leagues
in
the
gulf.
and
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
state
department's
own
maps,
which
are
reproduced
on
page
111
of
texas
brief,
this
is
called
or
referred
to
an
international
boundary
by
our
own
state
department.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland

mr.
spessard
l.
holland
111.
if
the
court
please,
in
the
brief
time
that
i
have
here,
i
want
to
try
to
specifically
state
the
position
of
mississippi
in
the
15
minutes
time
that
i
have
here,
and
that
which
i
left
undone,
my
assistant
who
follows
me,
with
30
minutes,
will
try
to
be
more
clear
on
--
than
i
am.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
yes,
sir.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
no,
sir.
frankly,
i
think
the
law
is
clear.
i
think
the
act
of
admission
of
mississippi
is
so
clear
and
in
--
the
submerged
lands
act
is
so
clear.
and
it
doesn't
necessitate
in
the
court.
and
if
it
does
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well,
of
course,
if
the
court
calls
for
evidence,
we
would
certainly
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
no,
sir.
i
think
it
so
plain
that
it
really
is
not
necessary.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
we
will
if
the
court
decides
that
we
are
so
wrong
in
our
taking
if
this
is
plain,
we
will
settle,
yes,
sir.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
sir?
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
as
to
our
boundary?
the
coastline?
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
sir?
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well,
it
probably
could
be
confined
to
that,
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
the
act
of
congress
itself
takes
care
of
it,
sir.
we
stand
foursquare
on
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
grants
to
the
congress
the
exclusive
right
or
power
to
dispose
of
territory
and
other
property
belonging
to
the
united
states.
and
then,
article
iv,
clause
2
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
says
that
acts
enacted
pursuant
thereto
are
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
we
submit
that
the
issues
presented
by
this
litigation
are
clearcut,
plain,
unambiguous.
certainly,
it
solely
a
domestic
issue
controlled
entirely
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
all
they're
talking
about
foreign
policy
and
international
law
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
issues
presented
to
this
court
in
this
case.
we
stand
squarely
on
the
sole
authority
of
congress
to
authorize
formation
of
a
state
to
determine
the
territory
that
shall
compose
such
state
and
by
setting
forth
its
boundaries
and
the
exclusive
right
and
power
of
congress
to
see
to
any
state
title
to
possession,
control
and
use
of
any
territory
or
property
that
might
belong
to
the
united
states.
taking
our
stand
on
that
position,
we
go
to
the
enabling
act
of
congress
in
1817
when
mississippi
--
when
you
had
the
mississippi
territory
and
when
it
authorized
the
people
of
what
constituted
that
part
of
mississippi
territory.
to
form
a
state,
congress
at
that
time
clearly
and
unequivocally
set
forth
what
should
constitute
that
state
once
they
had
written
a
constitution
and
decided
to
form
a
state
and
give
it
a
name.
i
certainly
will
not
bother
the
court
with
the
over
whole
description
of
what
shall
constitutes
state
of
mississippi
but
going
to
that
part
which
we
are
so
directly
concerned
with
here,
“thence
due
south
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
thence
westwardly,
including
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore
to
the
most
eastern
junction
of
pearl
river
with
lake
borgne,
thence
up
said
river
to
the
31st
degree
if
north
latitude,
thence
west
along
said
degree
of
latitude
to
the
mississippi
river
and
then
north
back
to
the
point
of
beginning”.
that
is
the
southern
boundary
line
of
the
state
of
mississippi
as
described
in
the
act
--
enabling
act,
which
was
so
well
pointed
out
yesterday
by
governor
daniel
following
the
process
of
how
a
state
might
be
bought.
and
there,
they
set
out
specifically
what
should
constitute
the
state
of
mississippi.
and
in
the
use
of
six
leagues,
that
was
not
pulled
out
of
--
in
the
act.
the
use
of
six
leagues
first
appeared
going
way
back
to
the
time
of
george
iii
of
england
when
he
divided
the
territory
which
then
constituted
florida
in
the
east
and
west
florida.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
here
that
that
part
of
alabama
and
mississippi
now,
of
course
was
at
that
time
part
of
the
east
and
west
florida.
west
florida
came
about
a
third
of
the
way
up
into
what
now
constitutes
the
state
of
mississippi.
that
was
the
first
time
we
have
any
record
of
the
term
six
leagues
being
used
when
it
was
ceded
to
the
united
states.
and
then
the
congress
when
it's
--
when
it
authorized
the
formation
of
these
states
certainly
didn't
reach
up
in
full
six
leagues
out
of
thin
air.
they
were
using
a
description
that
was
used
at
the
time
when
it
became
a
part
of
the
united
states
of
america.
and
we're
authorizing
the
formation
of
two
states,
state
of
mississippi
first
and
then
the
state
of
alabama
and
incorporating
in
that
description
the
same
identical
description
that
the
united
states
of
america
had
when
it
acquired
those
lands.
and
as
this
court
has
so
often
held
that
certainly
congress
can
dispose
of
any
lands
that
it
had
to
any
state
that
it
wants
to.
it
could
be
a
one
state,
one
league
and
another
10
leagues.
if
it
owned
it,
then
i
don't
know
of
anything
it
was
set
--
set
such
a
conveyance
aside.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well,
you
mean
--
sir,
i
--
i
don't
get
you
on
this
question.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
i
don't
know,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
yes.
of
course,
i
don't
know
if
i
can
answer
that
question.
i'm
not
trying
to
be
facetious
but
i
believe
the
advice
on
the
court
and
the
congress
faced
it
to
me
like
that,
i'd
say
that's
your
job
and
not
ours,
go
back
and
say
what
you
want
us
to
give
to.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
yes,
sir.
i
understand
that.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
i
think
the
boundary
in
the
case
of
the
state
of
mississippi
clearly
define,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
submerged
lands
act
doesn't
beg
of
any
mysterious
argument
or
any
baffling
definition
of
what
boundary
meant
or
what
coastline
meant
because
the
congress
in
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act
specifically
said
what
they
meant
from
the
(inaudible).
therefore,
it
doesn't
beg
of
any.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
sir?
in
the
submerged
lands
act
when
it
sets
out
what
boundary
shall
be.
navigable
--
what
--
what
navigable
water
shall
mean,
such
in
be
there
what
the
term
“boundaries”
mean.
they
--
they
are
plain.
it's
--
it's
a
wonderfully
drafted
bill
in
clear
and
unmistakable
language,
as
i
see
it,
as
to
what
the
congress
meant
by
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
description
of
the
state
of
mississippi
as
set
out
in
the
enabling
act
in
1817,
that
if
the
same
identical
description
that
we
have
followed
in
our
successive
constitution.
it
was
set
out
verbatim
in
the
constitution
of
1817
that
admitted
us
into
the
union.
it
was
referred
to
in
the
constitution
of
1832
and
in
1869.
when
we
were
permitted
to
come
back
into
the
union,
we
again
picked
it
up
and
readopted
it
and
it
is
now
set
forth
in
full
in
our
present
constitution
of
1819.
i'd
like
to
also
point
out
that
in
this
reference
to
six
leagues,
the
congress,
in
authorizing
the
formation
of
the
state
of
mississippi
when
they
use
six
leagues
by
virtue
of
it
having
been
six
leagues
when
the
u.s.
government
acquired
it,
they
could've
said
three
and
a
half
or
four
leagues
and
included
this
very
change
of
others
that
we're
talking
about
here
right
now.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
no,
sir.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
(voice
overlap)
before
(inaudible)
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
which
is
only
about
10
miles,
sir,
from
the
land
which
having
about
ten
and
a
half
from
the
seaward
side.
so,
as
they
said
four
leagues,
it
would've
incorporated
those
islands.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
lower
part
here
was
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
rather,
it's
a
long
--
here,
somewhere
in
the
--
the
west
florida
is
incorporated
all
that
the
gulf
coast
(inaudible)
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
of
alabama
and
mississippi
on
over
through
the
mississippi
river.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
not
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
i
failed
to
see
anything
confusing
about
the
description
of
the
state
of
mississippi
as
the
solicitor
wants
to
confine
us
to
--
to
just
those
islands
there
and
say
that
that's
all
we've
got,
nothing
between.
it
seems
to
me
like
--
let
me
put
a
country
lawyers
view
on
it,
that
when
the
united
states
government
said,
“we
had
all
islands
within
six
leagues,
six
leagues
that
they
had
acquired,”
that
seems
to
me
like
--
just
like
conveying
a
piece
of
property
200
feet
long,
100
feet
wide
including
all
buildings
and
other
things
located
thereon
certainly,
the
purchaser
is
not
restricted
to
what
might
be
located
within
the
lands
that
are
conveyed
to
him.
he
just
makes
the
description.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
sir?
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
because
that
is
the
(inaudible)
in
here
that
referred
to
as
mississippi
south
inland
waters.
it
doesn't
conceive
that.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
no.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
no.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
we
claim
it
under
the
--
we
claim
it
under
the
right,
under
the
very
description
that
--
that
describes
the
state
of
mississippi
when
it
was
authorized
to
form
a
state,
it's
also
inland
water
actually
at
mississippi's
sound
and
not
gulf
of
mexico.
of
course,
it
joins
up
with
it
and
the
inland
waters
do
not
meet
the
open
sea
and
as
you
get
on
further
south
of
these
islands.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well,
of
course,
the
--
the
original
act,
sir,
brought
it
down
to
--
to
where
the
land
meets
the
water.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
yes,
sir.
that
was
(inaudible)
that's
what
they
referred
to
is
the
--
but
i
submit
that
that
land
in
between
the
islands
and
the
land
of
state
of
mississippi,
that
--
that
is
part
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
it's
inland
waters,
it's
mississippi
south.
the
government
concedes
that,
that
our
coast
line
is
the
seaward
side
of
(inaudible)
they
concede
that
in
their
brief.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
is
our
coastline,
the
seaward
side
of
those
islands.
they
concede
that,
sir.
therefore,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
in
the
very
few
minutes
that
i
have
left
here
that
although
mississippi
was
not
departed
to
the
california
and
texas
cases,
the
court
held
that
the
states
own
--
own
it
to
the
coast
but
further
held
that
only
the
congress
could
dispose
of
submerged
lands.
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
disputed
or
argued
that
the
submerged
lands
act
was
the
result
of
the
decision
of
this
honorable
court
in
the
california
and
texas
cases.
that's
all
it
brought
it
in
to
be.
now,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
specific
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
only
time
the
word
“leagues”
are
used
in
the
submerged
lands
act
is
when
in
dealing
with
the
states
bordering
on
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
others,
it
border
on
the
two
oceans,
it
says
marks.
and
those
bordering
only
great
lakes,
it
says
the
international
boundary.
but,
when
it
comes
down
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
what
does
it
say
in
--
in
describing
the
term
“boundaries”?
we
don't
have
to
go
to
the
dictionary
for
the
purposes
of
this
act.
all
we
have
to
do
is
read
the
act.
and
it
says
but
in
no
event
shall
the
term
“boundaries”
or
term
“lands
beneath
navigable
waters”
being
interpreted
as
extending
from
the
coastline
more
than
three
geographical
miles
west
in
the
atlantic
or
the
pacific
ocean
or
three
marine
leagues
until
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and
i
submit
that
that
it
wasn't
in
either
gesture
on
the
part
of
congress
when
they
recognized
three
marine
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
if
the
distinguished
solicitor's
argument
is
to
be
accepted
by
this
court,
he
is
asking
this
court
to
write
out
of
this
act
those
specific
provisions,
and
the
governor
of
texas
so
ignored
hereon
yesterday.
that
very
thing
was
attempted
to
be
done
when
this
bill
was
under
consideration
and
twice
the
senate
refused
to
do
it
and
wants
the
house
of
representative
refused
to
do
it.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
entire
spreading
into
section
4
of
this
act
it
so
--
which
says,
“nothing
in
this
section
is
to
be
construed
as
questioning
or
in
any
manner.
they're
just
seeing
the
existence
of
any
state
seaward
boundary
beyond
three
geographical
miles
if
it
was
so
provided
by
its
constitutional
laws
prior
to
or
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
if
it
has
been
heretofore
approved
by
congress.”
and
then
following
up,
the
submerged
lands
act,
we
got
the
continental
shelf
lands
act.
its
been
argued
here
that
the
--
the
government
claim
has
no
jurisdiction
beyond
these
three
miles.
and
yet
in
section
4
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
we
find
the
united
states
government
say
that
the
constitution,
laws
and
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
of
the
u.s.
are
hereby
extended
to
the
subsoil
and
seabed
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
to
all
artificial
islands
and
fixed
structures
which
maybe
erected
thereon
to
the
same
extent
as
if
the
outer
continental
shelf
where
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
located
within
a
state.
and
i
submit,
if
your
honor
please,
that
with
all
deference,
the
letters
from
secretary
of
state,
with
all
deference
to
what
somebody's
foreign
policy
maybe
at
any
particular
time
in
the
history
of
this
nation,
never
has
this
court
held
that
foreign
policy
or
letters
of
the
secretary
of
state
can
repeal
a
specific
act
of
congress.
and
that's
what
is
almost
attempted
to
prevail
upon
this
court
to
have
done.
that
has
never
been
the
law,
and
i
hope
never
is.
the
act
of
congress
in
dealing
with
these
lands
on
the
discussion
is
certainly
the
supreme
law
of
this
land
and
the
one
that
we
stand
on.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
and
repeat
and
then
i'm
through.
we
stand
on
our
own
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america.
we
stand
on
the
authority
of
congress
to
convey
that
which
belongs
to
the
united
states
of
america.
we
stand
on
interpretation
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
it's
not
--
to
me,
it's
not
complicated.
it
boils
down,
as
one
of
the
justices
asked
here
this
morning,
it
simply
boils
down
to
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
boundary
line
of
a
state
and
what
--
and
what
do
you
get
from
there
under
the
terms
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
we
submit
that
under
the
california
case,
our
coastline
would
give
these
islands.
we
accept
that
of
course.
and
we
submit
that
under
this,
that
it
is
much
as
we
will
convey
six
leagues
that
we
are
entitled
to
--
to
go
all
out
the
three
leagues
as
conveyed
by
this
submerged
lands
act
and
what
true
of
us
is
true
of
all
the
other
states.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
one
more
time
that
the
only
time
the
word
“league”
is
used
in
this
act
is
in
dealing
with
the
state's
bordering
on
the
gulf
of
mexico.
in
dealing
with
the
others,
it
says
“miles”.
i
thank
the
court
for
the
time
you've
given
me.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
ask
the
pleasure
of
the
court
with
reference
to
whether
we
should
proceed.
i
see
we
have
10
minutes
to
the
closing
time.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
i
should
first
refer
very
briefly
to
this
map
which
i
have
been
already
adverted
to
by
our
attorney
general
that
the
coastal
province
of
florida
stands
from
its
north
boundary
where
it
joins
with
georgia
on
the
atlantic
ocean
down
the
open
atlantic
for
several
hundred
miles,
and
then
into
the
trades
of
florida
for
--
between
the
150
and
200
miles,
and
then
back
to
its
mainland.
then
for
a
distance
which
as
i
recalled
it
around
470
miles,
prolong
the
west
coast
of
florida
bordering
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
claims
of
florida,
as
we
think,
are
substantiated
by
the
facts
under
the
law
that
relates
to
a
three-league
boundary,
are
confined
to
the
gulf-frontage
along
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
the
mainland
of
florida.
i
do
not
comprise
the
frontage
northward
on
the
gulf
of
keys
or
southward
on
the
straights
of
florida
and
the
atlantic
ocean
of
the
keys,
nor
eastward
on
the
atlantic
ocean
of
the
mainland
of
florida.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that
is
cape
sable.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
it's
from
that
point
north.
the
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
point
farthest
to
the
north
or
west,
your
honor?
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
point
farther
to
west
is
the
point
that
where
florida
joins
alabama
as
the
mouth
of
the
perdido
river.
and
incidentally,
the
two
states
by
compact,
proved
by
congress,
have
so
clarified
and
made
certain
that
point
of
joinder
that
any
engineer
could
locate
it
and
that
has
been
done
in
the
efforts
to
clarify
the
property
claims
between
the
states.
now,
the
attorney
general
has
already
said
that
state
of
florida
has
the
two
claims,
one
under
the
first
string
of
the
ball
which
applies
to
the
boundary
of
the
state
when
it
entered
the
union,
which
claim,
as
i
conceive
it
to
be,
is
almost
identical,
if
not
identical
with
the
claims
of
alabama
and
of
mississippi
and
is
quite
similar
to
the
claims
of
at
least
part
of
louisiana.
west
florida
extended
at
one
time
than
the
apalachicola
river,
which
is
this
location
here
all
the
way
across
to
louisiana.
and
farther
north,
went
to
even
farther
west
extending
all
the
way
to
the
mississippi
river.
but
florida
was
subject
to
be
shunted
back
and
forth
between
spain
and
england
and
france
on
particular
occasions
and
it
so
happens
that
we
lost
that
excellent
part
of
west
florida
now
comprised
in
much
frontage
of
alabama
and
mississippi
and
some
of
the
area
of
louisiana
during
the
course
of
shuffling.
we
hope
that
will
be
the
last
of
our
good
state
which
we
shall
lose
at
anytime.
the
part
of
the
florida
case
which
i
shall
discuss
as
quickly
as
i
can
in
the
time
allotted,
relates
to
that
string
of
the
ball,
which
reserves
where
the
boundary
has
been
extended
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
beyond
the
three
geometric
miles,
but
not
to
exceed
three
leagues
by
constitution
of
the
state
and
that
constitution
approved
by
act
of
congress.
it
is
our
claim
that
the
constitution
of
florida
was
approved
in
1868
by
congress
and
that
the
boundary
provision
which
is
article
1
of
that
constitution
and
which
is
being
carried
forward
as
article
1
in
the
present
constitution,
the
constitution
of
1885,
gives
us
three
leagues
off
the
mainland
of
the
coast
of
florida
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that
was
--
that
was
the
constitution
of
1868
one
was
and
1885
one
did
not
come
to
congress,
the
1868
one
did
come
to
congress.
and
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
all
of
the
other
states
that
came
back
to
the
representation
in
congress
and
to
the
opportunity
to
function
again
through
their
local
governments
had
to
draft
their
constitutions
and
present
them
under
the
wording
on
requirements
of
the
reconstruction
act
for
examination
and
approval.
now,
those
are
the
two
words
used
by
the
congress.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that
is
what
florida
is
relying
on
in
the
second
phase.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
constitution
were
approved
for
all
of
the
other
states,
if
your
honor
please.
i
can't
say
they
were
of
the
same
kind.
i
am
not
familiar
with
it,
but
apparently,
this
boundary
question,
insofar
as
it
affects
the
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
is
peculiar
to
florida.
if
there'd
be
any
other
state
that
is
affected
by
this
question,
i
have
not
heard
of
it.
at
the
end
of
the
war,
the
war
between
the
states,
sometimes
called,
the
civil
war,
the
country
was
in
great
confusion.
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
florida
had
adopted
a
new
constitution
in
1865,
the
congress
required
the
state
of
florida
and
all
other
states
that
were
in
the
confederacy
to
frame
new
constitutions
under
the
reconstruction
act.
at
the
time,
it
was
one
of
the
great
confusion
in
florida,
goes
without
question.
i
think
that
the
court
would
take
notice
through
the
debates
at
least,
that
there
was
great
confusion
in
congress,
because
there
was
bitter
argument
of
the
most
serious
sort
throughout
this
period.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
reconstruction
act,
as
the
court
well
knows,
was
passed
over
the
veto
of
the
then
president,
president
johnson,
and
then
the
various
acts
supplemental
thereto
were
passed,
as
i
recall,
over
his
veto
and
the
act
readmitting
to
representation
of
the
states
and
reinstalling
their
civil
government,
so
that
they
could
begin
to
function,
again
was
passed
over
the
veto
of
the
president.
and
the
court
will
know
and
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
relations
between
the
congress
and
the
executive
were
exceedingly
strain
and
that
the
--
after
that
impeachment
began
very
shortly
thereafter
and
came
as
i
recall
within
one
vote
of
--
of
success.
it
was
a
time
of
bitterness
and
it
was
a
time
of
suspicion,
a
natural
suspicion,
on
the
part
of
congress,
which
did
not
include
senators
and
house
and
representatives
from
the
south
in
looking
after
the
reorganizations
of
governments
that
were
tempted
by
the
southern
states.
now,
i
say
that
without
any
bitterness
at
all,
it
was
very
natural
that
such
a
situation
should
exist.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
it
certainly
would.
that's
the
first
point
i
was
going
to
make
and
your
honor
has
gone
ahead
of
me
and
i
appreciate
he's
mentioning
it,
that
if
any
constitution
--
that
every
constitution
that
came
up
at
that
time
was
bound
to
be
very
closely
and
carefully
scrutinized,
because
of
the
bitterness
that
existed,
and
that
the
well-founded
suspicion
because
of
the
certain
things
that
has
--
that
has
happened
towards
the
good
faith
with
those
who
were
seeking
so
hard
to
reorganize
their
states.
and
i
think
it
unnecessary
to
remind
this
honorable
court
that
those
who
had
seats
in
the
constitutional
conventions
were
very
frequently
not
long
time
established
citizens
of
the
state,
because
by
the
times
of
the
reconstruction
act,
many
of
them
were
disqualified
from
either
voting
or
accepting
a
--
a
representation
as
a
delegate
or
holding
office
of
any
kind
at
that
time.
so
that
the
whole
situation
was
one
which
was
very
scrambled
and
very
confused,
if
it
please
the
court,
i'm
just
getting
started.
i
see
that
the
time
has
--
has
come
for
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
thank
you
very
much.
you're
very
kind.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
brief
argument
of
yesterday,
i've
gotten
to
the
point
where
i
covered
that
part
of
the
record
showing
that
a
convention
was
held
at
tallahassee
pursuant
to
the
reconstruction
act.
beginning
in
january
of
1868
ending
with
the
signature
of
a
new
constitution
on
february
25th
which
then
was
submitted
to
the
people
who
adopted
it
in
an
election
on
may
4th,
5th
and,
6th
whereupon
the
new
constitution
was
certified
to
the
president
on
may
27th.
the
action
of
congress
was
june
25th,
1868
by
which
the
new
constitution
of
florida
along
with
the
new
constitutions
of
the
five
other
act
--
states
covered
in
that
act
were
acted
upon
by
congress,
and
as
we
contend,
were
approved
by
congress.
it's
admitted
by
the
government
that
article
1,
the
boundary
article
of
that
constitution,
covered
the
submerged
lands
off
of
the
mainland
of
the
west
coast
to
florida
extending
into
the
gulf,
a
distance
of
three
marine
leagues,
and
there's
no
argument
there.
the
argument
is
as
to
whether
congress
approved
that
part
of
the
constitution.
now,
mr.
president
--
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
appropriate
to
go
to
the
facts
insofar
as
they're
disclosed
by
the
record
and
i
shall
attempt
to
do
so
briefly
in
the
time
that
is
allowed
to
me.
the
president
furnished
to
congress
on
its
request
the
two
documents,
miscellaneous
document
114
and
miscellaneous
document
297
of
the
second
session
of
the
48th
congress.
first
of
those
covered
simply
the
convention
constitution,
the
one
that
was
actually
adopted.
the
other,
at
the
special
request
of
the
congress,
covered
all
three
of
the
constitutions
which
were
considered
by
the
convention.
and
one
of
which
incidentally,
was
claimed
by
the
chairman
of
the
rock
convention
which
met
briefly
in
tallahassee
following
the
departure
of
the
majority.
it
was
claimed
by
that
convention
to
have
been
adopted,
though
that
particular
aversion
was
not
submitted
to
the
people.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
number
297.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
interesting
fact
about
those
three
different
constitutions,
one
of
which
was
adopted,
the
other
two
of
which
were
not,
is
that
all
of
them
had
an
article
1,
boundary
article.
all
of
them
showed
the
same
desire
of
the
framers
of
the
convention
and
the
people
of
florida
to
extend
their
boundaries
but
all
of
them
had
a
different
--
each
of
them
had
a
different
provision
from
the
others
relative
to
the
distance
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
off
the
mainland
of
florida,
showing
rather
conclusive
to
the
congress
when
that
document
was
furnished
that
here
had
been
a
matter
of
real
controversy
in
the
constitutional
convention.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
they're
found
on
florida
briefs
at
the
pages
18
to
27
and
i
had
not
intended
to
go
into
them
in
detail
because
of
the
limit
of
time
and
because
i
am
sure
the
court
has
considered
and
will
continue
to
consider
this
fact.
but
i
wanted
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
any
argument
that
the
congress
did
not
understand
that
the
boundary
represented
a
change
and
that
the
boundary
had
been
a
matter
of
very
great
controversy
in
the
convention
is
clearly
set
aside
when
we
consider
these
three
different
versions,
which
were
submitted
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
a
congressional
document
considered
by
the
members
of
both
houses
in
their
hands
and
on
their
desks
when
this
debate
took
place.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
no.
the
one
draft
that
followed
the
constitution
of
1865
which
i
referred
to
you
yesterday
and
uncovered
islands
within
five
leagues,
another
covered
a
limit
at
five
leagues,
and
the
one
submitted
and
ratified
by
the
people
covered
a
limit
at
three
leagues.
and
i
think
that's
important
not
to
only
showing
the
controversial
nature
of
this
subject
in
such
a
way
that
--
i
am
advised
by
my
assistant
that
that
reference
should
have
been
to
the
appendix
of
the
florida
brief
rather
than
to
the
principal
portion,
pages
18,
27
of
the
appendix
of
the
florida
brief.
i
think
that
it's
important
not
only
to
show
that
the
congress
was
bound
to
know
about
this
controversy,
bound
to
know
about
the
difference
of
opinion
on
the
boundary
provisions
and
the
desire
of
the
convention
to
claim
what
it
could
properly.
but
i
think
it's
also
extremely
important
because
the
--
the
method
of
delineating
that
boundary
which
was
chosen
by
the
convention
and
which
was
submitted
to
the
people
and
ratified
by
the
people
and
then
submitted
to
congress
and
passed
upon
there,
is
the
limit
three
leagues
which
had
already
been
enacted
into
the
foreign
policy
of
our
nation
in
the
texas
matter,
because
it's
so
evident
that
somebody
there
must
have
known
about
that
situation
and
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo.
this
is
only
an
argument
on
the
conclusion.
i
have
already
stated
to
the
court
that
the
records
except
as
to
the
journal
of
the
convention
are
a
very
sketchy
and
i
think
the
confusion
at
those
times
easily
explains
that
situation.
so
that
how
could
congress
have
missed
the
fact
that
here
was
a
three-league
boundary
being
submitted
after
controversy
and
here
was
a
boundary
of
which
comported
where
the
act
of
united
states
has
ratified
already
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states
in
approving
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
because
it's
quite
evident
that
there
were
persons
there
who
wanted
to
go
farther
than
the
three-league
limit.
incidentally,
mr.
seward,
the
secretary
of
state
who
had
had
some
thought
in
the
border
--
in
the
boundary
controversy
prior
to
that
time,
was
the
secretary
of
state
at
this
time,
was
seating
right
here
as
adviser
to
the
president
and
to
the
congress
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
objection
from
his
part,
nor
for
that
matter
is
there
any
evidence
or
any
objection
on
the
part
of
any
member
of
either
the
house
or
the
senate.
now,
we
all
know
that
congress
and
particularly
that
congress
well
knew
the
importance
of
boundaries.
this
same
congress
on
march
1,
1867,
had
admitted
nebraska
to
statehood.
this
same
congress
is
bound
to
have
known
the
constitutional
provision
in
article
4,
paragraph
(3),
providing
for
the
admission
of
new
states
and
prohibiting
the
inclusion
of
parts
of
any
other
states
without
the
consent
of
those
states.
we
wonder,
mr.
justice
and
your
honor
--
your
honors,
whether
congress
can
be
held
to
have
been
unconcerned
at
this
stage
about
the
possibility
of
conflicting
boundaries,
because
they
well
knew
that
they
were
admitting
to
a
representation
and
were
acting
upon
the
constitutions
of
six
states,
five
of
which
were
contiguous
one
to
the
other,
and
all
of
which
were
contagious
to
other
states
which
were
in
the
same
situation
that
is
operating
under
the
reconstruction
act.
and
they
must
have
well
known
that
the
boundary
question
was
one
of
the
important
and
it's
impossible
for
me
to
conceive
that
they,
with
the
recent
recollection
of
the
admission
of
nebraska
and
with
full
knowledge
that
in
enabling
act,
admitting
states,
the
principal
part,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
except
the
little
brief
formula
for
the
admission,
is
the
delineation
of
the
boundary
of
the
states.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
mr.
justice.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
black.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
i'm
unable
to
answer
that
question
because
i
haven't
examined
their
constitutions
sufficiently.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
it's
certainly
true
that
the
state
of
florida
had
the
claim
under
prior
acts
in
ancient
history
about
which
the
court
has
heard
to
a
six-league
boundary.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that's
correct
and
also
from
the
fact
that
in
the
treaty
of
1819
and
in
the
conveyance
of
the
two
territories
of
florida
to
united
states,
the
words,
while
referring
to
the
earlier
history
and
identifying
it
so
that
it
could
be
pursued,
also
spoke
of
the
two
territories
being
included
in
the
state
and
the
adjacent
islands
which
were
administered.
i
don't
believe
that's
the
exact
word
but
that's
the
substance
in
connection
therewith.
mr.
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
depend
of
the
form
i
think
--
i
think,
mr.
justice.
now
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
i
don't
think
it
is
because
i
think
that
the
state
by
its
act
and
the
congress
by
its
act
were
the
two
bodies
who
had
the
full
authority
to
set
the
boundary
at
this
time.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
and
i
think
it's
immaterial
as
to
whether
the
boundary
was
receded
at
that
time
or
was
a
--
jotted
out
in
accordance
with
whatever
the
interpolation
of
the
law
in
that
situation
would
be.
certainly,
the
state
thought
that
it
had
six
leagues
at
that
time.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that's
correct.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you're
exactly
correct.
the
moving
party
in
this
matter
was
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
the
meeting
of
the
constitutional
convention
which
i've
already
said,
followed
a
similar
one
in
1865
in
which
the
state
had
tried
to
adjust
itself
to
its
new
situation
was
held
upon
the
mandate
of
congress.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
justice
is
exactly
correct
in
his
--
in
his
statement
and
i
want
to
mention
at
this
time
a
fact
that
seems
to
have
been
overlooked
by
learned
government
counsel.
and
that
the
--
the
act
also
require
--
provides
in
an
earlier
portion
of
it,
that
the
new
constitution
must
be
“in
conformity
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
all
respects.”
so
there
is
more
involved
here
than
a
mere
question
of
republican
form
of
government
and
there's
more
involved
here
than
a
mere
question
of
loyalty
as
suggested
by
learning
counsel.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
but
there
is
a
general
question
and
there
is
a
general
requirement
not
only
of
submission
for
examination
and
approval
but
then
a
requirement
of
actual
approval
of
that
new
constitution.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
constitution
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
constitution
insofar
as
the
admission
of
new
states
requires
that
they
may
not
be
permitted
to
be
carved
out
of
another
state
or
to
take
any
part
of
another
state
without
the
approval
of
that
state
and
thus
therefore
require
the
careful
examination
and
approval
of
congress
with
--
within
the
meaning
of
that
rule
and
requirement.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
i
think
you're
completely
right
and
that
brings
me
to
my
next
point
which
will
require
me
to
go
out
of
this
record
but
into
other
matters
of
which
the
court
may
take
judicial
notice.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
there
has
not.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
there
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
there
might
have
been
on
the
border
with
alabama
but
there
is
no
such
claim
and
there
was
no
such
fact.
the
real
fact
is
though,
that
because
a
lab
had
existed
for
many
years
and
was
still
existing
at
that
time,
and
i
will
quote,
i
will
cite
the
supreme
court
case
in
which
that
is
well
referred
to.
it's
u.s.
123,
page
1,
the
case
coffee
against
groover
which
outlines
the
--
and
that's
a
case
in
1872,
i
believer,
outlines
that
the
fact
that
boundary
dispute
which
had
affected
the
2000
square
miles
of
florida's
boundary
had
existed
before
the
purchase
of
the
floridas.
it
was
first
in
argument
between
the
united
states
for
georgia
and
to
the
spanish
government.
and
second,
then
an
argument
between
georgia
and
the
united
states
for
the
territory
of
florida
and
then
finally,
an
argument
between
the
two
states
which
found
itself
coming
into
the
supreme
court.
the
case
would
be
found
11
howard,
293.
and
the
much
more
full
discussion
of
the
case
is
found
in
u.s.
report
58
at
page
478,
when
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
has
sought
intervention
and
was
allowed
intervention
for
certain
purposes.
those
pages,
478
to
524
show
an
exhausted
discussion
of
the
subject.
i
am
sure
that
here
is
a
subject
matter
that
was
first
in
international
dispute,
then
in
dispute
between
georgia
and
the
territory
of
florida,
and
then
in
dispute
between
the
states
leading
to
the
filing
of
a
suit
in
this
very
court
and
to
the
long
argument
of
it
and
to
the
writing
of
that
opinion
in
the
case
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
u.s
reports
58
at
page
478.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
i
think
that
position
is
completely
reasonable
and
i
think
that
any
other
position
would
be
completely
unreasonable,
because
here
with
knowledge
of
congress
--
because
it
would
have
there
on
two
occasions
long
historical
documents
printed
on
this
subject.
i'll
give
the
references
to
them,
documents
77
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
23rd
congress,
1st
session.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
they're
not,
and
that's
the
reason
that
i
am
giving
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
document
77
and
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
of
the
23rd
congress,
1st
session,
and
then
--
that
was
in
1831.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that
related
to
the
contents
between
the
territory
of
florida
and
the
state
of
georgia
which
was
going
on
at
that
time.
and
it's
a
very
compendious
document
of
120
pages.
and
the
second
document,
a
much
longer
one,
is
miscellaneous
document
25
of
the
senate
of
the
33rd
congress,
2nd
session,
1855.
this
was
reprinted,
and
it's
a
document
of
396
pages.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that's
about
the
same
controversy.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that
was
the
33rd
congress
and
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
it's
the
whole
document,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
document
25
of
the
33rd
congress.
that's
the
senate
document
and
the
other
the
house
one.
and
i
--
i
--
i
am
going
into
some
details
to
give
this
information,
because
i
do
want
this
court
to
see
at
least
as
i
see
it
that
here
was
a
controversy
then
pending
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
which
not
only
the
two
states
were
joined
in
combat
but
in
which
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
had
asked
to
come
in
because
certain
federal
public
lands
had
been
deeded
and
were
still
held
and
there
was
an
important
federal
question
involved
there.
that
is
in
the
2000
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
location
of
the
area
in
dispute
ran
from
this
point
which
is
the
confluence
of
the
flint
and
chattahoochee
rivers
that
form
the
apalachicola
to
this
point.
and
the
court
will
observe
that
that
is
an
straight
line
in
the
sense
that
it's
far
--
it's
the
straight
but
it
doesn't
follow
a
degree
of
latitude.
and
it
runs
from
that
confluence
to
the
head
of
st.
mary's
river.
the
state
of
georgia
claimed
that
the
head
of
the
st.
mary's
river
was
the
ahead
of
south
fork
of
the
st.
mary's
river
which
headed
up,
and
that's
not
shown
on
this
map,
but
it
heads
up
in
about
this
position.
so
that
the
payment
was
involved
was
(inaudible)
by
comprising
2000
square
miles
of
what
was
then
thought
to
be
the
most
valuable
land
in
the
state
of
florida,
because
little
value
it
had
at
that
time
had
been
assigned
to
the
lower
part
of
the
peninsula.
and
the
fight
was
a
very
bitter
one.
the
case
which
i
have
cited,
u.s.
123
page
1,
gives
the
history
likewise
and
shows
that
the
state
of
florida
and
the
state
of
georgia
out
of
court
reached
a
settlement
which
the
state
of
florida
accepted
in
1861
and
which
the
state
of
georgia
accepted
in
1866.
so
that
we're
right
in
the
middle
of
this
controversy
at
the
very
time
of
the
war
and
at
the
very
time
that
these
troublesome
questions
came
up.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that's
correct.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that's
--
that's
correct.
and
they
--
there
--
there's
just
no
probability
or
even
possibility
as
i
see
it
that
the
congress,
well
knowing
this
situation,
and
the
attorney
general,
well
knowing
the
situation,
and
the
two
states
while
not
represented
certainly
having
representatives
to
speak
for
them
here
in
the
capital
of
the
nation,
would
have
left
unnoticed
any
departure
from
an
accurate
delineation
of
that
boundary.
and
it's
certainly
impossible
to
believe
that
the
congress
gave
no
attention
to
that
boundary
under
those
conditions.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
none
at
all,
but
the
if
the
congress
looked
at
the
boundary
articles,
they
were
looking
at
the
entire
article
which
covers
both
the
land
and
the
water
boundaries.
and
incidentally,
the
same
disparity
which
exists
among
the
three
constitutions
as
to
the
water
boundary
and
the
gulf
does
not
exist
here.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
after
1868?
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
no,
the
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
the
state
georgia
accepted,
was
the
last
party
to
accept
in
1866
and
the
congress
approved
it
in
1872.
but
the
two
states
--
and
it
took
the
--
it
took
the
approval
of
congress
ultimately
because
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
congress
approved,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
it
approved
the
whole
article
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
boundary
but
approved
this
particular
part
of
the
boundary
in
1872
after
this
time,
because
it
was
involved
in
the
combat
between
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
the
states
of
florida
and
georgia.
and
the
court
will
see
upon
examination
of
the
two
documents
that
the
matter
came
to
congress
repeatedly
and
that
repeated
resolutions
were
introduced
and
some
passed
seeking
to
dispose
of
this
troublesome
question.
now,
i
do
not
like
to
indulge
in
semantics
and
i
don't
think
i
am
in
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
action
of
congress
was
mentioned
many
times
during
the
debate
by
members
of
the
congress
as
being
action
to
approve
or
an
approval,
and
as
following
the
--
the
mandate
of
the
reconstruction
act
which
required
approval.
i
won't
exhaust
that
point
but
it
would
be
found
on
pages
63
to
72
of
the
florida
brief.
likewise,
there
were
several
contemporary
or
early
interpretative
statements.
this
didn't
affect
only
the
boundary
question,
this
affected
the
question
of
the
state
to
begin
to
function,
take
over
its
election
machinery,
even
the
right
of
legislations
to
begin
to
pass
acts,
the
right
of
the
governor
to
be
something
more
than
a
provisional
governor.
and
those
questions
came
up
in
several
instances
before
the
military
and
attorney
general
hoar
of
the
united
states
at
that
time,
on
august
28,
1869,
addressed
the
secretary
of
war
with
a
long
letter
submitted
in
compliance
with
his
request
of
which
--
in
which
this
quotation
is
found.
“until
congress
should
have
approved
the
constitution,
the
legislature
could
not
pass
any
act.”
and
he
held
that
the
congress
did
approve
the
constitution.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
there
was
none.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
there
was
no
discussion
and
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well,
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
submerged
lands
question
in
the
congress
which
we
think
makes
a
stronger
case
for
the
fact
that
nobody
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
objected
to.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
frequent
discussion
and
that
point
was
made
abundantly
clear
many
times
that
the
congress
felt
or
at
least
those
members
of
congress
asserting
that
position
of
which
they
were
many
that
approval
had
been
had
at
that
time.
and
it
wasn't
deniable
gesture
to
put
into
this
bill
the
two
conditions;
one,
the
boundaries
at
the
time
of
statehood
and
the
other,
the
boundaries
in
the
constitution
heretofore
approved
by
congress.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
it
--
it
was
shown
many
time
in
the
debate
that
congress
understood
that
that
latter
provision
pertain
to
this
1868
matter.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well,
i
believe
that
that
debate
was
in
the
later
time
but
what
--
regardless
of
when
it
was,
if
the
congress
so
intended,
it
was
certainly
their
duty
to
look
to
see
whether
the
task
done
by
the
constitutional
conventions
carried
out
that
obligation.
i
do
not
think
however
that
that
obligation
was
imposed
by
that
debate
at
that
particular
time.
now,
there
were
later
reference
in
the
court
cases,
and
i
am
sorry
i
have
to
rush
along,
but
in
three
instances,
the
--
this
court
referred
to
this
action
of
1868
always
it
was
obiter,
wilkes
county
commissioner
against
coler,
a
1901
case
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
he
said
that
“the
constitution”
-
at
that
time
it
was
the
constitution
of
north
carolina
-
“was
approved
by
the
congress,
june
25,
1868.”
in
the
case
of
beauharnais
and
so
forth,
343
u.s.,
taking
place
just
a
few
years
ago
1942,
i
believe
it
was,
mr.
justice
jackson
quoted
this
act
and
the
action
of
congress
in
these
words
"that
these
constitutions"
were
nevertheless
approved
by
congress.
and
in
the
case
white
against
hart
80
u.s
649
in
1872
cited
by
opposing
counsel.
we
think
that
case
is
much
more
strongly
in
favor
of
our
position
because
he
says
in
his
--
in
his
opinion,
mr.
justice
williams
says
that
the
this
constitution
was
sanctioned
by
congress
and
upon
looking
at
the
meaning
of
that
word,
we
find
that
is
at
least
as
strong
as
the
meaning
of
the
word
approved.
now
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
yes,
sir.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
i
don't
believe
either
was
and
incidentally
confusion
later
arose
as
to
the
two
descriptions
because
of
the
erosion
at
the
mouth
of
perdido
river.
so,
the
two
states
set
up
a
commission
which
worked
out
that
boundary
and
submitted
it
to
congress
and
congress
approved
the
--
the
compact,
as
i
think
i
mentioned
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
that
was
quite
recently,
i
think
four
or
five
years
ago.
i
am
sorry
i
don't
have
the
exact
year.
we
can
supply
that.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well
now,
i
say
that
i
have
very
little
time
left.
i
want
to
call
attention
to
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well,
i'll
make
it
just
as
short
as
i
can
and
i
appreciate
the
indulgence
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
of
mr.
justice
black.
i
hope
it
has
the
approval
of
the
court.
maybe
i
am
used
to
talking
in
greater
length
in
the
forum
that
i
belong
to
but
i'll
try
to
comport
myself
in
accordance
with
the
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well,
i
am
supposed
to
yield
whenever
any
distinguished
member
of
this
court
requests
me
to
do
so.[laughter]
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
i
don't
have
the
right
of
refusal
that
i
would
have
elsewhere.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
my
next
point.
i
want
to
make
it
only
briefly
is
that
florida
proceeded
to
assume
jurisdiction
and
make
use
of
this
submerged
land
in
the
gulf
and
there's
many,
many
indications
of
that
not
only
in
our
statutes
to
which
i
shall
not
refer,
but
particularly
to
references
in
three
federal
cases.
all
appearing
in
the
briefs,
the
case
of
cunningham
against
skiriotes
at
page
53
of
the
florida
brief,
the
case
of
pope
against
blanton
which
was
a
three-judge
federal
court,
in
the
district
court
of
florida
and
the
case
of
skiriotes
against
florida
in
this
court
where
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
mentions
the
controversy
but
found
the
easier
ground
to
decide
it
than
to
--
at
that
time
and
upon
the
evidence
then
submitted,
decide
where
the
boundary
laid.
and
all
of
those
cases
though
show
affirmative
that
the
state
of
florida
in
the
exercise
of
its
own
jurisdiction
and
sovereignty,
they
had
statutes
applying
out
to
the
three-league
line
and
these
cases
all
arose
outside
of
the
three-mile
line
and
between
at
the
time
the
three-league
line
as
shown
in
the
decision.
and
that
purpose
for
that
particular
jurisdiction
shown
in
those
three
cases
was
the
regulation
of
the
sponge
industry
which
is
an
important
industry
of
the
west
coast
of
florida.
i
shall
not
labor
that
point
but
all
this
cases
showed
clearly
that
florida
exercised
the
jurisdiction
and
used
it
and
claimed
it.
now,
when
it
came
to
this
case
and
i
again
will
have
to
proceed
more
rapidly
than
i
have
expected.
the
congress
proceeded
very
carefully.
it
heard
the
testimony
of
the
three
federal
executives
who
are
most
involved
in
this
except
the
president
and
they
received
a
letter
from
him,
which
has
already
been
mentioned
by
another
in
the
argument.
but
mr.
secretary
mckay
of
the
interior
department
testified
his
testimony
of
page
30
of
florida
brief.
mr.
attorney
general
brownell
at
page
957
of
the
senate
hearings
and
in
the
texas
brief
also,
both
of
them
affirmatively
stating
that
as
to
the
case
of
florida,
their
boundary
was
out
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
off
of
the
mainland
coast.
and
then
we
call
the
department
of
state
--
the
senate
called
the
department
of
state
and
mr.
tate,
assistant
solicitor
but
testifying
for
the
department,
testified
to
a
great
caution
and
his
testimony
will
be
found
in
the
senate
hearings.
but
i'll
refer
to
three
places,
page
1053,
page
1078,
page
1086
because
i
cannot
at
this
time
read
those.
but
the
substance
of
it
was,
first,
that
he
recognized
the
fact
that
in
the
case
of
florida
and
one
other
state,
texas,
there
was
precedent
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
boundaries
to
three
miles.
and
he
also
testified,
and
this
is
the
matter
which
i
want
to
call
especially
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
in
this
troublous
case
that
confronted
him,
it
could
by
settled
without
trespassing
upon
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
by
having
the
act
refer
only
to
the
development
and
production
of
the
seabed
and
not
to
the
extension
of
the
territorial
waters
out
there.
furthermore,
in
the
--
the
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
no.
but
he
showed
the
knowledge
of
it,
stated
that
florida
and
texas
were
the
two
exceptions
and
in
his
testimony
said
in
so
many
words
that
here
was
a
case
in
which
congress
could
find
the
solution
which
had
no
disrupting
effect
whatever
on
the
foreign
policy.
that's
the
point
that
i
want
to
make.
and
the
letter
from
mr.
secretary
dulles
signed
for
him
by
assistant
secretary
morton
makes
that
same
point.
and
in
pursuance
of
that
point,
as
the
records
here
will
show,
the
senate
committee
proceeded
to
amend
the
act
so
as
to
make
it
in
the
alternative
so
that
very
clearly,
it
would
cover
only,
might
be
construed
to
cover
only
the
assignment
of
the
rights
of
development
in
the
seabed.
the
letter
from
mr.
dulles
is
found
on
page
1088
on
the
--
in
the
record
of
the
hearings
of
the
senate
and
--
senate
or
house
--
senate.
and
i'll
just
read
this
last
sentence
because
it's
so
meaningful.
“hence,
a
grant
of
jurisdictional
powers
of
the
state
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
the
traditional
position
of
this
nation
would
have
to
be
restricted
to
the
purposes
indicated
above.”
those
purposes
as
the
court
will
find
were
the
purposes
of
operation
of
the
submerged
lands.
and
incidentally,
the
committee
immediately
met
--
immediately
met
that
situation
by
producing
from
the
bill
which
had
been
filed
as
drafted
by
44
attorneys
general
producing
various
changes
and
amendments
which
may
--
would
make
it
clear
that
this
act
could
be
construed
as
i've
indicated.
the
court
will
find
on
page
5
of
the
senate
report,
the
sentence
which
makes
that
clear.
the
measure
also
provides
that
in
addition
to
title
and
ownership
but
distinct
from
them,
the
states
shall
have
the
right
and
power
to
manage
or
administer,
at
least
develop
and
use
such
lands
and
natural
resources
in
accordance
at
the
time
of
the
senate
joint
resolution
13.
and
whatever
rights
the
federal
government
may
have
in
such
management
and
administration
or
established
in
and
assign
to
the
states.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
well,
i
think
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
may
i
--
may
i
trespass
only
in
this
regard.
i
would
like
to
give
the
numbers
of
the
amendments
if
the
court
will
indulge
it
--
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
--
which
carry
out
that
same
objective
and
they
are
amendments
--
numbers
28,
29,
30,
31,
32,
and
33,
all
appearing
on
page
19
of
the
report
and
amendments
69
and
72
appearing
on
page
20
of
the
report.
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
that
action
having
been
taken.
mr.
spessard
l.
holland
on
page
1088
of
the
submerged
land
act
hearings.
one
more
statement
and
i
am
through.
this
effort
in
the
congress
was
a
serious
effort
to
compose
serious
differences.
in
connection
with
this
bill,
we
produced
also
the
outer
continental
shelf
bill
and
we
recognized
federal
rights
and
the
area
covered
by
that
to
about
nine-tenths
of
the
submerged
lands
within
the
continental
shelf
and
to
about
five-sixths
of
the
estimated
oil
and
gas
to
be
found
in
the
submerged
land.
our
effort
was
--
or
the
effort
of
congress,
and
as
shown
clearly
by
the
records,
was
a
very
careful
one
after
the
submission
of
all
the
statements
from
everyone
in
government
or
out
of
government
that
were
felt
to
have
an
interest
in
this
matter
and
i
--
and
i
expressly
hope
that
it
will
meet
with
the
approval
of
the
court
in
this
latest
case
as
it
has
already
with
reference
to
the
three-mile
limitation,
because
we
think
that
is
greatly
to
the
interest
of
the
nation
and
of
each
state
involved
to
have
the
matter
settled
so
that
the
development
of
any
resources
that
maybe
there
may
go
forward
in
an
uninterrupted
fashion.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
indulgence.
