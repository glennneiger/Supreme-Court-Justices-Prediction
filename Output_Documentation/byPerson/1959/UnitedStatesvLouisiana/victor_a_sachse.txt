mr.
victor
a.
sachse
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
article
iv
of
section
3
authorizes
the
congress
to
admit
states
and
fix
their
boundaries.
and
it
provides
further
that
their
boundaries
once
so
fixed,
are
not
to
be
changed
except
by
action,
joint
action,
of
the
congress
and
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
concerned.
in
1803,
the
united
states
bought
louisiana
from
france.
and
it
became
the
first
american
territory
on
the
gulf
of
mexico.
out
of
this
louisiana
territory,
came
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
first
american
state
to
join
this
great
union
on
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
creation
of
the
state,
the
establishment
of
the
state
was
in
keeping
with
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
by
which
louisiana
was
purchased
that
the
united
states
would
hold
the
area
in
trust,
for
states
to
be
formed
out
of
it.
and
louisiana
became
the
keystone
to
the
american
development
on
the
gulf
of
mexico.
what
happened
with
us
became
the
pattern
for
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
people
who
established
that
pattern
for
us
were
the
same
people
who
established
the
pattern
for
the
gulf
of
mexico
throughout
and
therefore,
it
becomes
of
extreme
importance
to
see
just
what
they
did.
to
begin
with,
in
1804,
they
created
the
territory
of
orleans.
and
they
did
so
by
saying
that
all
of
that
part
of
the
country
of
louisiana,
which
had
been
purchased
from
france,
all,
not
just
part,
but
all.
that
was
south
of
the
mississippi
territory
on
the
east
side
of
the
mississippi
river
and
south
of
the
thirty-third
degree
of
latitude
on
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
river,
would
constitute
the
territory
of
orleans.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes,
sir.
we
have
one,
sir.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes.
and
we
have
two
separate
briefs
--
briefs
from
louisiana.
one
which
we
filed
in
august
of
1958
and
one
which
we
filed
in
september
of
1959.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
both
in
white
covers.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no,
sir.
we
have
brief
of
the
state
of
louisiana
in
our
position
to
motion
for
a
judgment
on
amended
complaint
by
the
united
states
which
we
filed
in
august
of
1958.
and
then
we
filed
louisiana's
reply
brief
and
motion
to
file
with
the
supporting
statement,
which
we
filed
in
september
of
1959.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
those
are
the
two
briefs
at
this
time,
yes,
sir.
now,
we
had
filed
briefs
when
we
stood
before
the
court
alone.
after
the
territory
of
orleans
was
established,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
enacted
the
enabling
act
of
1811.
and
in
it,
it
authorized
the
people
of
a
territory
to
form
a
state
in
the
union.
the
language
of
that
congressional
act
which
is
the
second
time
the
congress
spoke
concerning
louisiana,
is
of
great
importance
for
it
says
that
the
state
is
to
be
banned
out
of
the
area,
contained
within
all
of
the
area,
contained
within
the
following
limits,
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river
and
this
sabine
river
becomes
important
for
us.
it
is
important
for
texas
and
this
louisiana
description
is
important
for
all
of
the
gulf
states.
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river,
at
the
river
sabine;
thence
by
a
line
to
be
drawn
along
the
middle
of
said
river,
including
all
islands
to
the
thirty-second
degree
of
latitude;
thence,
due
north,
to
the
northernmost
part
of
the
thirty-third
degree
north
latitude;
thence,
along
the
said
river
--
and
the
said
parallel
of
latitude,
to
the
river
mississippi;
thence,
down
the
river
--
the
said
river,
to
the
river
iberville,
which
is
now
by
a
man
shack
near
my
city
of
baton
rouge
or
to
the
river
iberville
and
from
thence,
along
the
middle
of
the
said
river,
and
lakes
maurepas
and
ponchartrain
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
thence,
bounded
by
the
said
gulf
to
the
place
of
beginning,
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
this
is
the
beginning
of
it.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes,
sir.
the
entirety
of
it
is
crucial,
justice
black,
as
we
see
it.
because,
our
statute
that
is,
the
act
of
congress
which
enabled
louisiana
to
become
a
state,
set
a
perimeter
construction,
it
said
that
all
of
the
territory
of
louisiana,
all
of
the
country
of
louisiana
which
the
united
states
had
acquired,
contained
within
these
following
limits,
should
become
the
state
of
louisiana,
if
the
people
adopted
the
constitution
and
if
the
federal
congress
approved
that
constitution.
and
this
description
was
not
one
which
said
that
louisiana
would
have
a
mainland
and
a
number
of
islands
or
a
part
of
a
river
and
a
number
of
islands.
but
that
we
should
begin
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine.
that
we
should
go
through
the
center
line
of
the
sabine,
taking
all
islands
that
happened
to
be
within
the
center
line
of
the
sabine,
that
those
islands
were
incidental
to
the
boundary
line
which
is
the
center
line
of
the
sabine.
but
then
we
should
go
to
the
thirty-third
degree
latitude,
come
down
the
mississippi
river
and
to
iberville
river
to
the
gulf,
back
to
the
point
of
beginning
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
coast.
again
the
matter
of
islands
was
incidental.
the
essential
thing
and
this
court
has
held
--
the
essential
thing
is
that
louisiana
wants
to
have
a
water
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and
the
only
place,
the
only
measure
for
that
water
boundary
as
set
by
our
act
of
admission
is
at
three
leagues
from
coast
the
same
measure
--
the
same
measure
which
the
congress
in
1953
set
as
the
limit
to
which
any
of
the
states
on
the
gulf
coast
could
claim
these
property
rights
of
the
submerged
lands
and
the
natural
resources.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no,
sir.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no,
sir.
we
are
claiming
three
leagues
from
coast.
the
fact
that
islands
form
within
--
fall
within
the
three
leagues
from
the
coast,
again
is
a
matter
of
an
incidental
affair.
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
near
the
coast
of
louisiana,
these
islands
form
--
they
are
moved
by
the
action
of
the
waves
on
the
gentle
incline
of
the
bed
of
the
gulf
of
mexico.
there
is
now,
the
sea
where
there
once
were
islands.
there
are
now
islands
where
there
once
was
sea.
and
we
could
not
put
our
boundary,
nor
could
the
congress
put
our
boundary
as
based
upon
these
transient
islands.
the
congress
put
our
boundary
by
a
perimeter
description
three
leagues
from
coast
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
that
is
the
meaning
of
this
language
as
we
see
it.
it
is
the
meaning
of
the
preposition,
“within”
as
the
courts
have
defined
it.
it
is
the
meaning
that
has
been
given
in
the
only
case
that
i
know
about,
a
new
york
case,
which
dealt
with
the
jurisdiction
of
new
york
and
it
drew
a
line
allowing
all
of
the
islands
to
embrace
them
all
and
it
is
the
conclusion
of
this
court
in
the
state
of
louisiana
against
mississippi
in
the
202
u.s.
1.
now
candor
requires
me
to
say
that
you
didn't
then
find
it
necessary
to
say
the
measure
of
the
boundary
around
our
coast,
but
this
court
said
emphatically
and
categorically
that
it
was
a
water
boundary,
a
deep
water
channel,
following
the
pearl
river
coming
around
the
islands
going
around
the
delta
of
the
mississippi
and
to
the
sabine.
so,
i
say
that
the
entire
history
of
this
matter
up
to
this
day
is
a
recognition
by
the
federal
government
by
the
state
of
louisiana
of
a
three-league
boundary
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
from
our
coast.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no,
sir.
we
equate
the
word
coast
in
the
way
that
the
federal
government
has
defined
it.
that
is
where
the
inland
waters
meet
the
deep
waters
of
the
sea.
and
that
line
has
been
marked
long
ago
by
the
proper
agencies
of
the
federal
government.
and
that
is
what
we
claim
to
be
our
coast
because
that
is
where
the
federal
government
fixed
it.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
it
embraces
the
islands,
but
it
is
not
limited
by
the
islands.
the
islands
are
within
the
inland
waters.
it
is
the
outer
edge
of
the
inland
waters
which
marks
our
coast.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no,
sir.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no.
our
coast,
as
we
understand
the
way
it
has
been
fixed
from
the
beginning
of
our
state
and
interpreted
by
our
state
and
by
the
federal
government,
by
the
congress,
by
this
court,
by
other
agencies
of
the
government
consistently
throughout
all
our
period,
starts
at
the
sabine
river
on
the
west
and
goes
to
the
pearl
river
on
the
east,
coming
three
leagues
from
coast
at
the
sabine
river
and
going
on
around
three
leagues
from
coast
until
it
enters
the
pearl
river,
where
it
was
marked
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
louisiana
against
mississippi.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
they
are
--
if
--
if
you
think
of
the
mainland
as
--
as
the
land
before
you
get
to
any
water
at
all
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes.
they
are
far
out
from
the
mainland.
they
are
within
our
boundary
and
the
court
held
so
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
--
in
louisiana
against
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
that
is
right.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
not
at
that
point,
because
this
court
drew
a
line
which
separated
our
coast
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
--
from
mississippi.
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
as
you
have
established
the
boundary
line
between
louisiana
and
mississippi.
but
as
we
come
around
the
mississippi
delta
and
go
to
the
sabine
river,
the
coast
has
been
declared
to
be,
as
we
understand
the
law,
where
the
deep
waters
of
the
gulf
meet
the
inland
waters
and
our
territorial
limits
go
three
miles
--
three
leagues
beyond
that
which
is
the
measure
of
the
quitclaim
or
conveyance
or
grant
by
the
federal
congress
in
the
submerged
lands
act
to
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
the
important
of
this
thing
--
the
important
thing
at
the
moment,
i
believe,
is
to
establish
that
it
is
the
three-league
measure.
neither
the
government
nor
ourselves,
believe
that
we
can
settle
in
this
hearing.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
what
is
the
baseline?
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
that
is
true.
we
think
that
the
congress
when
it
admitted
louisiana
and
the
congress
in
the
submerged
lands
act
made
a
clear
distinction
between
coast
and
shore.
and
our
coast
is
somewhat
out
from
our
shore,
because
there
is
a
large
part
of
the
area
in
front
of
louisiana
that
is
never
uncovered
by
the
movements
of
the
tides.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
and
we
think
that
the
congress
did
the
same
thing
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
now,
after
louisiana,
louisiana's
act
of
admission
was
passed
in
1811,
our
people
adopted
the
constitution
setting
the
same
limits,
the
same
boundary
exactly
as
the
congress
had
proposed.
it
was
not
until
april
8,
1812,
that
congress
passed
the
enabling
act
which
admitted
louisiana
into
the
union.
so
that
our
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
louisiana
became
a
member
of
the
union,
is
a
boundary
which
had
been
established
prior
to
the
time
louisiana
became
a
member
of
the
union,
first,
by
the
act
of
congress
of
1811,
the
enabling
act,
then
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
finally,
by
the
act
of
admission
itself.
so
we
don't
have
the
problem
of
what
existed
at
the
time
we
came
into
the
union.
it
was
well
established
then,
that
on
the
argument
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
not
exactly
that.
the
exact
language
is,
thence,
bounded
by
the
said
gulf
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
--
to
the
place
of
beginning,
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast.
and
i
might
just
as
well
meet
the
issue
that
that
language
might
present
at
this
moment.
it
could
be
argued
and
doubtless,
the
government
we're
arguing
that
we
had
our
mainland
and
we
had
whatever
islands
might
happen
to
be
three
leagues
from
the
mainland.
but
if
we
did
not
have
a
perimeter
boundary,
if
we
did
not
have
a
water
boundary
encompassing,
falling
along
three
leagues
from
coast.
now,
the
only
way
on
earth
that
they
could
deprive
louisiana
of
what
we
think
congress
gave
us
or
quitclaim
to
us,
or
relinquished
to
us
by
the
submerged
lands
act,
is
to
prevail
in
such
an
argument
as
that.
and
we
think
that
such
an
argument
would
be
completely
fallacious.
to
begin
with,
we
think
that
the
language,
the
language
that
any
lawyer
would
use
in
trying
to
mark
out
the
area
that
he
had
acquired
--
the
method
that
any
surveyor
would
use,
in
trying
to
mark
off
the
area
that
is
louisiana.
the
method
that
the
united
states
coast
guard
did
use
in
marking
off
the
water
boundaries
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
method
that
this
court
used
in
louisiana
against
mississippi
in
marking
off
the
boundary
of
louisiana
was
to
start
at
the
sabine
and
mark
a
distance
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
around
to
the
pearl
river
and
not
attempt
to
run
along
the
shore
of
louisiana
with
a
line
darting
out
to
an
island
here
and
an
island
there
and
an
island
in
another
place
and
going
back,
so
that
the
island
would
be
bound
to
us
only
by
political
bond
and
not
a
part
of
the
area
of
the
state,
a
concept
which
the
courts
have
generally
rejected.
and
we
say
that
everything
in
the
history
of
our
state
to
this
moment
supports
this
perimeter
description.
now,
i'd
like
to
show
to
the
court
how
the
government,
the
federal
government
itself,
at
the
time
the
other
states
came
into
the
union,
regarded
the
matter.
and
i
think
it
will
demonstrate
--
i
hope
it
will
demonstrate
conclusively
that
the
argument
that
texas
has
made
for
its
three-league
boundary
into
the
gulf
of
mexico,
is
absolutely
solid
and
that
it
depends
and
is
based
upon
the
verity
of
the
arguments,
we
now
make
in
louisiana.
because
you
see,
starting
from
louisiana
in
the
surge
eastward
and
westward
and
it
occurred
at
the
same
time,
it
became
necessary
for
our
government
to
acquire
territories
to
sustain
and
to
fix
the
boundary,
we
explained.
these
were
done
by
the
treaty
of
1890.
now,
how
that
became
necessary
i
think
is
interesting.
but,
i'm
sure
the
court
knows
this.
you
know
that
the
people
from
kentucky
and
tennessee
came
down
into
our
area.
you
know
that
from
1763
until
1783,
the
english
claimed
that
part
of
our
coast
which
is
now
mississippi
and
alabama
and
florida.
spain
had
denuded
to
england
at
the
end
of
the
french
and
indian
war,
at
the
same
time
that
france
ceded
louisiana
to
spain.
when
england
got
it,
england
claimed
six
leagues
into
the
sea
through
the
proclamation
of
george
iii
of
october
7,
186
--
1763.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
this
is
where
mississippi,
alabama
and
florida
are
now.
king
george
iii
divided
florida
into
west
florida
and
east
florida.
as
spain
had
held
it,
there
had
been
no
such
division.
king
george
iii
made
that
division
claiming
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
coast
for
the
whole
of
this
area
and
in
language
which
i
think
and
the
lawyers
of
mississippi
and
alabama
think,
also
described
a
perimeter
in
the
sea,
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
for
those
areas.
now,
after
this
occurred,
came
of
course,
the
war
of
independence
and
during
the
war
of
independence,
the
spanish
under
governor
galvez
in
new
orleans,
came
into
my
area
of
louisiana
around
baton
rouge.
had
a
battle
with
the
english
and
drove
them
out.
in
1783,
when
our
treaty
of
peace
was
signed,
england
as
a
part
of
the
same
transaction
retroceded
the
florida's
--
to
spain.
so
that
when
louisiana
was
purchased
and
when
louisiana
became
a
state,
to
the
east
of
us,
lays
spanish
territory,
to
the
west
of
us,
lays
spanish
territory.
when
the
louisiana
purchase
was
made,
our
commissioners
were
directed
by
mr.
jefferson
to
claim
all
islands
within
six
leagues.
and
in
doing
so,
he
was
giving
recognition
to
what
george
iii
of
england
had
proclaimed
and
he
said
so,
and
he
told
the
commissioners
that
they
should
surely
of
such
--
such
claims,
because
england
had
not
objected
to
--
to
such
a
measure,
but
had
proclaimed
it
and
that
spain
and
france
had
been
agreeable
to
it,
when
england
proclaimed
it
and
by
all
means
to
make
like
claims
to
the
united
states.
and
so
you
see
that
at
that
time,
mr.
jefferson,
who
was
president,
was
certainly
not
limiting
their
claims
of
the
united
states
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
any
three
miles,
but
was
claiming
all
that
any
of
the
powers
which
it
held
this
area
had
claimed
before.
however,
the
commissioners,
while
they
were
intent
on
getting
the
seat,
because
that
was
of
importance
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
at
the
time,
neglected
to
specifically
say
that
they
were
getting
that
part
of
louisiana
which
is
bounded
by
the
mississippi
river
to
the
west
and
the
pearl
river
to
the
east
and
the
iberville
river,
or
by
a
man
shack
to
the
south
and
the
mississippi
territory
to
the
north.
so,
our
people
who
lived
there
under
the
leadership
of
a
man
named
(inaudible)
who
was
the
judge
then,
but
had
been
consul-general
of
the
united
states
to
france,
had
a
revolution.
and
they
established
the
west
florida
republic
in
1810.
and
they
raised
there,
the
first
lone
star
flag,
a
white
star
on
a
field
of
blue.
they
called
on
the
united
states
government
to
annex
the
territory.
the
united
states
did
so.
and
the
congress
acted
directing
troops
into
the
territory.
the
congress
acted
also
in
annexing
to
the
mississippi
territory
that
part
of
west
florida
which
forms
the
coast
of
mississippi
and
annexing
to
alabama
that
part
of
west
florida
which
forms
the
coast
of
alabama.
this
court
recognized
all
that
i'm
talking
about
in
foster
against
neilson.
these
same
people
who
were
compelling
the
forward
expansion
of
the
american
government,
of
the
american
country
of
the
united
states,
then
moved
westward
and
we
had
to
deal
with
spain
and
so
we
did.
in
1819,
spain
ceded
west
florida
and
east
florida
to
the
united
states.
in
the
very
same
act,
spain
and
the
united
states
agreed
upon
a
boundary
between
the
two
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river
in
the
sea.
now,
they
did
not
say
how
far
that
point
was
in
the
sea,
but
the
only
measure
that
they
had
to
go
by
was
the
three
leagues,
the
three-league
measurement
which
had
been
set
by
congress
with
respect
to
louisiana.
in
1828,
when
the
mexicans
had
their
independence,
this
treaty
of
1819
was
confirmed
in
1836,
when
the
texans
had
their
independence
and
they
enacted
their
boundary
act
of
1836,
without
which
they've
been
a
lot
said
already.
they
put
it
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
and
they
called
it
three
leagues
into
the
sea
and
they
said
that
it
was
the
boundary
that
had
been
determined
by
the
united
states
and
spain
in
1819.
they
were
not
taking
just
any
point,
anywhere
out
of
the
sky
or
out
of
the
sea.
they
went
to
the
existing
declarations
of
policy,
the
existing
laws
of
our
country
at
that
time.
they
recognized
that
the
southwest
corner
of
the
united
states
and
the
southwest
corner
of
louisiana
had
been
fixed
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
in
the
sea
that
it
could
only
be
three
leagues
from
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
in
the
sea.
they
put
their
own
corner
there.
and
their
boundary
descriptions
specifically
says
that
on
their
eastern
line,
they
are
following
the
boundary
fixed
between
spain
and
the
united
states
to
the
point
of
beginning
and
the
point
of
beginning
is
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
from
land
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine.
now,
in
the
same
--
in
the
same
boundary
act,
they
direct
their
governor
barnett
to
negotiate
with
the
united
states
to
establish
it.
and
he
did.
and
the
april
25th,
1938
convention
accepts
that
boundary
and
appoints
commissioners
to
mark
off
a
part
of
the
boundary,
not
the
entirety
of
it,
but
appoints
commissioners
to
mark
off
a
part
of
that
boundary
as
established
by
the
act
of
1836
tying
it
exactly
and
only
to
the
boundary
of
louisiana.
this
was
done.
the
commissioners
went
down
there.
they
put
a
mound
on
the
west
bank
of
the
sabine
at
the
mouth.
and
the
government
makes
a
point
of
--
of
the
location
of
this
surveyor's
mound.
but
i
ask
you,
how
would
these
surveyors
have
put
a
mound
three
leagues
from
land
in
the
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico?
they
put
the
mound
where
obviously
they
had
to
put.
and
all
of
you
as
lawyers
have
had
experience
with
surveyors
and
you
know
that
since
no
surveyor
can
walk
on
the
water,
all
surveyors
from
land
have
to
have
land
markings,
bench
marks,
which
take
you
to
the
actual
legal
boundaries.
why
--
why
on
earth
would
the
boundary
of
texas
have
been
fixed
anywhere
else
than
where
i'm
saying?
how
could
it
have
been
fixed
anywhere
else?
a
boundary
has
to
be
aligned
between
neighbors.
the
texans
were
americans
before
they
were
texans.
they
came
out
of
louisiana,
from
kentucky,
from
tennessee,
but
through
my
area
with
their
own
star
flag.
they
traded
with
louisiana.
the
chief
road
into
texas
at
that
time
was
a
road
which
is
now
known
as
u.s.
highway
190,
throughout
opelousas,
louisiana.
it
was
there
because
that
is
the
nearest
land
to
the
gulf
above
the
deltaic
formations
of
the
mississippi
river.
and
that's
where
the
men
had
to
travel
and
that's
where
they
did
travel.
the
commerce
between
texas
and
the
united
states
was
chiefly
between
new
orleans
and
between
galveston
named
for
our
governor
galvez.
and
that
was
where
the
important
part
of
the
gulf
coast
territory
of
the
united
states
and
of
louisiana
existed
at
the
time
that
was
the
populous
part.
that
was
the
part
that
had
economic
value.
that
was
the
part
that
had
military
value.
that
was
the
part
that
our
country
was
insistent
upon.
so
of
course,
the
boundary
of
texas
was
tied
to
the
boundary
of
louisiana,
three
leagues
from
land
in
the
sea.
this
court
recognized
that
boundary
when
justice
harlan
and
earlier
justice
harlan
was
arguing
at
the
court
in
1896
in
united
states
versus
texas,
162
u.s.
1.
and
while
there
has
been
called
of
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
adjust
the
boundaries
of
texas,
no
move
whatever
has
been
made
to
adjust
the
boundaries
of
texas
or
of
louisiana
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
three
leagues
from
land.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
well,
i
do
it
the
way
i
think
the
surveyor
would
have
to
do.
i
do
it
the
way
i
think
the
surveyors
have
done
it
with
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
survey.
you
go
through
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
and
you
proceed
along
the
course
of
the
sabine
three-league
distance
into
the
sea.
and
then
you
proceed
at
the
same
measurements
from
the
coast
wherever
the
baseline
of
the
coast
is
determined
to
be
towards
--
towards
the
eastern
line
of
(inaudible)
and
you
draw
a
perimeter
description
three
leagues
from
land
and
into
the
sea,
so
that
all
islands
will
thereby
be
embraced,
though
i
say
again
that
the
matter
of
the
island
was
an
incidental
matter.
the
measure
of
the
three
leagues
is
the
important
measurement.
this
was
necessary
on
the
gulf
coast
not
only
of
louisiana,
but
of
texas
and
mississippi
and
alabama
and
florida,
because
we
have
shallow
waters
there,
because
the
continental
shelf
drops
so
slowly,
because
sometimes
for
a
mile,
boats
cannot
approach
the
shore.
in
1817,
commander
porter
reporting
from
the
secretary
of
navy,
that
he
couldn't
get
within
10.5
miles
of
the
mouth
of
the
sabine.
that
he
couldn't
get
within
30
miles
of
the
mouth
of
the
chapel
island
and
a
three-mile
limit
off
louisiana
or
mississippi
would
not
only
forbid
boats
to
travel
there
of
any
size,
but
then
might
even
wait
that
distance
from
our
mainland.
and
necessarily,
our
government
in
the
early
days
of
the
19th
century,
taking
into
consideration
the
nature
of
the
neighborhood
which
all
governments,
mr.
jefferson
said,
should
do
in
fixing
their
boundaries,
placed
one
far
enough
out
to
get
us
to
the
deep
waters
that
we
were
entitled
to
command.
not
wait
for
louisiana,
but
wait
for
the
united
states.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
162
u.s.
1.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes,
justice
black,
they
were.
but
in
getting
--
justice
douglas,
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
but
in
arriving
at
their
boundaries,
they
specifically
referred
to
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
spanish
territory,
the
western
boundary
of
the
united
states
fixed
in
1819
as
accepted
by
texas,
in
1836
as
starting
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine,
three
leagues
from
land.
and
that
part
of
their
boundary
has
never
challenged.
it
was
that
part
of
their
boundary
--
that
part
of
our
boundary
which
lead
to
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo.
there
had
to
be
some
basis
for
the
three-league
measurement.
where
else
could
it
come
from
except
from
the
acts
of
congress?
who
can
fix
the
limits
of
the
states
except
the
congress?
the
constitution
says
congress
shall
fix
them.
congress
did
fix
them.
and
our
government
has
acted
on
that
ever
since.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
of
the
coast.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
i
think
--
i
think
you've
stated
about
as
i
would
state
it
with
these
differences.
i
think
it
is
an
expressed
inclusion
of
three
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
i
think
that
it
is
far
more
than
saying
the
mainland,
plus
certain
islands
which
are
not
even
named.
i
think
it
necessarily
means
three
leagues
into
the
sea.
and
then
i
add,
but
if
there
is
any
doubt
in
the
language,
if
there
is
any
doubt
at
all
in
the
language,
then
the
contemporaneous
construction
of
it,
given
by
our
congress
over
a
period
of
years
extending
from
1811
when
the
enabling
act
was
passed,
until
1848
when
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
was
enacted,
establishes
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
that
at
all
times,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
meant
to
accord
to
louisiana,
meant
to
include
in
louisiana,
three
leagues
from
its
coast
into
the
sea.
and
that
it
was
not
until
in
the
1850s
long
after
louisiana
was
a
member
of
the
union,
long
after
mississippi
was
a
member
of
the
union,
long
after
alabama
and
florida
and
texas
were
members
of
the
union,
that
the
united
states
began
to
develop
any
foreign
policy
limiting
the
area
in
the
sea
to
three
miles
that
the
first
expression
of
it
becomes
anywhere
near
to
louisiana,
was
in
1862.
and
that
was
near
to
louisiana,
because
that
was
all
for
cuba,
after
you
get
past
the
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
the
point
where
they
are
merging
with
the
atlantic
ocean
and
with
the
caribbean
sea.
but
so
far
as
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
concerned,
neither
mr.
jefferson,
nor
anyone
else
for
our
government
until
long
after
these
states
were
in
the
union,
ever
spoke
at
all
of
any
three-mile
territorial
limit.
mr.
jefferson
himself,
when
he
put
the
minimum
of
a
three-mile
limit,
was
dealing
with
the
atlantic
ocean
and
the
first
time
he
had
to
deal
with
the
gulf
of
mexico,
he
called
on
our
commissioners
to
claim
six
leagues.
your
honors,
dealt
with
this
i
think
so
much
better
than
i
am
trying
to
deal
with
it,
when
you
decided
louisiana
against
mississippi.
when
you
got
to
that
case,
we
were
concerned
with
oyster
fishing.
we
were
concerned
with
submerged
lands.
and
as
your
honor
commented
yesterday
the
idea
of
the
sedentary
fishing
existed
long
before
the
truman
proclamation
and
it
was
involved
in
this
litigation
of
louisiana
against
mississippi.
we
had
laws
requiring
the
fishing
and
handling
of
oysters
to
be
done
in
a
certain
way.
mississippi
had
different
laws,
a
conflict
arose.
and
it
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
said
the
islands,
marsh
or
otherwise,
claimed
by
louisiana
in
this
case
were
all
within
three
leagues
of
our
coast.
the
act
admitting
mississippi
was
passed
five
years
after
louisiana
act,
yet
mississippi
claims
under
the
disputed
territory.
then
talking
about
the
rule
that
no
state
can
be
deprived
of
its
prior
territory,
the
court
proceeded.
and
when
the
louisiana
act
used
the
words,
“thence
bounded
by
the
said
gulf
to
the
place
of
beginning
including
all
islands
in
three
leagues
of
the
coast,”
the
coast
referred
to
as
the
whole
coast
of
the
state
and
the
peninsula
of
st.
bernard
formed
an
integral
part
of
it.
lake
borgne
in
mississippi
sound,
the
bodies
of
saltwater
and
as
such
parts
of
the
sea
or
gulf
and
as
the
coast
of
louisiana
began
along
the
north
shore
of
peninsula,
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
islands
referred
to
by
congress
in
the
louisiana
act
were
solely
those
islands
to
the
south
of
that
state.
i'd
like
to
pause
here
to
note
--
to
ask
your
honors
to
note
the
erroneous
way
in
which
i
think
the
government
has
treated
this
decision.
the
government
has
undertaken
to
treat
it,
if
i
understand
it
correctly
that
all
with
the
louisiana
and
mississippi
decision
was
concerned
with
was
the
st.
bernard
peninsula.
but
the
court
fixed
the
boundary
for
the
st.
bernard
peninsula
on
the
basis
of
our
coast
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
that
is,
deep
water,
where
the
inland
waters
meet
the
deep
waters.
and
because
it
is
so
important,
may
i
read
to
you
just
another
part
of
it.
the
court
said,
“the
united
states
geological
survey
published
in
the
year
1900,
a
bulletin
devoted
to
a
discussion
of
the
boundaries
of
the
states
territories
and
giving
a
history
of
changes
as
they
have
occurred.”
in
the
opinion
of
that
bureau,
louisiana
was
originally
bounded
by
the
deep
water
channel
and
is
the
owner
of
the
areas
in
dispute
today
according
to
the
report
and
accompanying
sketches
and
this
court
made
those
sketches
a
part
of
its
decision
and
so
a
water
boundary
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
now,
you'll
find
that
sketch,
your
honors,
on
page
21
of
louisiana's
separate
brief.
i'd
like
now
to
say
this,
when
the
submerged
lands
act
was
before
the
congress,
louisiana's
position
was
made
clear.
no
one
was
left
in
doubt
that
louisiana
was
discerning
a
claim
to
three
leagues
from
coast.
our
governor
kennon
came
up
and
appeared
before
the
committee
hearings
and
made
it
specifically,
categorically
and
as
i'm
trying
to
make
it
now.
moreover,
when
the
report
was
formulated,
the
--
the
same
exhibit
to
which
governor
daniel
referred
said
categorically
that
the
areas
which
would
go
to
the
state
coincide
with
the
three-mile
limit
for
all
states
except
texas,
louisiana
and
florida
gulf
coast.
in
the
latter
cases,
the
three-league
limit
as
established
before
or
at
the
time
of
entering
into
the
union
has
been
used.
and
it
was
this
committee
report
which
represented
the
better
opinion,
at
least
the
one
accepted
by
congress,
because
it
was
this
majority
report
which
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
submerged
lands
act
by
congress.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no,
i
rather
--
i
recognize
that
we
have
to
be
in
court.
that
we
have
to
ask
this
court
to
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
law,
that
our
boundaries
as
they
existed
at
the
time
we
came
into
the
union,
that
is,
as
established
by
our
enabling
act
and
our
constitution
and
our
act
of
admission
and
as
recognized
by
congress
thereafter,
are
where
i
say
they
there.
i
do
not
mean
that
the
submerged
lands
act
was
self-operating.
but
i
do
mean
that
it
is
no
--
could
be
no
surprise
to
any
congressman
or
anyone
in
the
united
states
that
the
louisiana
--
state
of
louisiana
asserted
a
claim
to
three
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
from
coast.
and
i'd
like
to
add
this.
that
in
the
government's
brief,
the
government
undertook
to
say
that
senator
holland
of
florida,
while
he
did
present
this
map
to
the
committee
later
said,
that
the
map
was
not
correct
as
to
louisiana.
so
mr.
scott
will
consume,
my
colleague
in
this
case,
undertook
to
make
the
calculations
necessary
to
demonstrate
and
he
does
demonstrate
conclusively
in
the
reply
brief
which
we
filed
in
september
of
this
year,
as
your
honors
will
see
on
page
13
that
the
area
claimed
for
louisiana
as
shown
in
this
exhibit,
depends
upon
the
three-league
measurement.
that
it
is
397
shorelines
in
miles,
multiplied
by
10.5
land
miles
to
make,
that's
the
three
leagues,
to
make
the
4168.5
square
miles.
the
report
says
4169
square
miles
and
i
guess
we
won't
be
held
with
the
other
half-mile.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
well,
i
give
it
to
you
as
it
reads
in
the
report.
the
measurements
on
the
map
shown
yesterday
by
mr.
gremillion,
show
a
coastline
measurement.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes,
but
the
measurement
that
the
government
made
was
on
the
basis
of
the
coast,
397
miles.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes.
and
the
government
now,
through
the
solicitor
general,
admits
that
our
calculations
were
correct.
that
senator
holland
was
right
at
the
time
that
he
was
saying
that
it
showed
three
leagues
for
louisiana
and
in
error,
asking
himself
wouldn't
it,
when
he
said
it
did
not.
because
the
government
on
its
final
reply
brief
or
last
reply
brief
if
not
final,
on
page
13,
admits
that
our
figures
are
correct
and
that
the
three-league
claim
was,
in
fact,
clearly
before
congress
at
the
time.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
i
think
it
proves
this,
your
honor.
that
we
do,
in
fact,
have
a
three-league
line
because
the
report
to
congress
was
based
upon
the
coast
and
geodetic
survey
made
by
the
federal
government
in
november
of
1950,
long
before
there
was
any
conflict
between
the
states
and
the
national
government
over
the
oil,
because
the
oil
was
not
then
known.
and
i
say
to
you
--
i
say
through
the
court
that
there
is
thus
a
long
sequence
of
recognitions
by
the
federal
government
starting
in
1811,
coming
down
to
1915
at
least,
during
which
the
congress,
this
court,
agencies
of
the
government
recognized
a
water
boundary
for
louisiana
and
whenever
a
measurement
was
applied,
that
measurement
was
three
leagues
from
coast.
i
think
that
to
say
now,
louisiana
has
something
less
than
that
is
to
turn
all
of
history
backward.
it's
to
disregard
all
of
the
history
of
the
gulf
coast
area
and
is
to
say
that
we
are
limited.
we
are
limited
to
three
miles
only
because
after
1860
--
after
1860,
the
federal
government
began
to
talk
of
three
miles
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
that's
not
the
test
made
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
submerged
lands
act
submits
the
test
of
boundaries
as
they
existed
at
the
time
or
if
we
use
section
4
or
prior
to
the
time
that
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
or
as
approved
by
the
congress
after
that
time.
we
say
that
when
we
were
admitted
into
the
union,
congress
declared
for
us
a
boundary
of
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
that
congress
applied
that
three-league
measurement
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
as
to
spain,
mexico
and
texas,
and
finally,
again
at
the
western
end
of
texas
with
mexico
and
that
we
have
met
the
test
which
the
congress
submitted
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
when
i
spoke
to
the
court
in
april
1957,
i
took
occasion
to
say
to
the
court
and
i'd
like
to
say
again,
that
the
same
congress
which
passed
the
submerged
lands
act
passed
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
that
the
congress
did
not
say
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
that
this
area
began
three
miles
from
shore
or
three
miles
from
coast,
but
that
it
began
to
where
the
submerged
lands
yielded
to
the
states,
relinquished
to
the
states,
or
vested
in
the
states.
and
i
think
that
the
submerged
lands
act
shows
clearly
that
the
congress
knew
of
the
decisions
of
your
honors,
in
the
california
case,
of
the
decision
in
the
louisiana
case.
they
knew
that
your
honors
had
said
that
at
the
turn
of
the
century,
there
had
been
no
general
agreement
and
i
talked
about
at
the
beginning
of
the
19th
century.
there
had
no
general
agreement
upon
any
three-mile
limit.
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
that
time
the
french
writers
and
the
spanish
writers
from
whose
domains
louisiana
came,
were
consistently
claiming
a
three-league
boundary
as
appears
in
our
briefs.
i
think
that
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
together,
show
that
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
meaning
in
which
boundary
was
to
be
used.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
the
congress
said,
“the
constitution
and
laws
and
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
are
hereby
extended
to
the
subsoil
and
seabed
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
to
the
extent
they
are
applicable,
they
also
permitted
the
extension
of
state
laws
with
the
expressed
declaration
that
this
would
not
have
the
effect
of
extending
the
property
rights
conveyed
by
the
submerged
lands
act
to
the
states.”
but
we
think
it
is
clear
that
louisiana
is
entitled
under
the
submerged
lands
act
to
three
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
from
coast.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
so
defined
by
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
--
statutes
of
the
united
states.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
that
is
right
because
that
is
what
the
submerged
lands
act
says
and
that
is
what
our
act
of
admission
says.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
they
are
all
inland.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
in
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
inland
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
--
from
the
three-league
line.
and
most
of
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
most
of
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
most
of
them
now,
i
would
say,
are
inland
from
the
coastline.
but
there
were
islands
at
the
time
louisiana
came
into
the
union,
which
were
beyond
that.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes,
by
the
actions
of
the
waves.
we
have
one
island,
kimberley
island
that's
moved
nine
miles.we
have
other
islands
that
are
going
altogether.
and
these
islands
come
and
go,
as
the
waves
move
them.
by
taking
up
here
and
building
up
there,
but
my
associates
say
and
i'm
sure
they're
correct,
that
there
are
still
islands
beyond
our
shoreline
--
our
coastline,
but
within
the
three-league
measurement.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
the
chandeleur
islands
is
between
us
and
--
around
the
boundary
between
us
and
mississippi.we
encompass
the
chandeleur
islands
and
then
mississippi
begins.
and
so,
we
don't
claim
into
the
mississippi
waters
recognized
as
belonging
to
them
by
this
court
in
louisiana
against
mississippi.
but
to
the
south,
which
we
--
to
the
south
of
louisiana,
we
claim
the
full
three
leagues,
because
there
has
been
no
curtailment
thereof
and
could
be
no
curtailment
thereof,
once
having
been
established
by
congress
under
article
iv,
section
3
of
the
constitution.
