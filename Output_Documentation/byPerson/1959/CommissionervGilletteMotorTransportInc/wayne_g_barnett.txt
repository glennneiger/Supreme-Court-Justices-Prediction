mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
during
world
war
ii,
the
government
seized
and
operated,
for
a
short
period,
a
number
of
motor
carriers
in
the
midwest
that
were
closed
down
by
strikes.
the
respondent
is
one
of
those
carriers
whose
properties
were
in
the
federal
control
for
about
10
months.
the
respondent
is
now,
been
given
an
award
of
just
compensation
for
that
seizure
measured
by
the
rental
value
of
his
equipment
for
the
10-month
period.
the
question
is
whether
that
award
is
ordinary
income,
as
we
contend
that
it
is,
or
whether
it
is
capital
gains.
the
tax
court
held
that
it
was
ordinary
income.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
--
it
was
capital
gains.
that
decision
which
was
in
direct
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
involving
another
carrier,
is
here
on
certiorari.
the
facts
of
the
seizure
are
relevant
here
only
as
background
and
can
be
briefly
dealt
with.
in
august
1944,
the
over-the-road
drivers
of
a
103
motor
carriers
in
the
midwest
went
out
on
strike.
the
strike
was
prompted
by
a
refusal
of
the
carriers
to
pay
a
wage
increase
recommended
by
the
war
labor
board.
because
of
the
emergency,
president
roosevelt
promptly
directed
the
office
of
defense
transportation
to
take
possession
and
control
of
those
lines
and
restore
them
to
operation.
that
was
accomplished
by
a
series
of
orders
and
directives
in
that
effect
of
which
was
that
the
carriers
were
required
to
pay
the
wage
increase
and
resume
normal
operations
subject
to
all
of
these
to
an
ultimate
federal
control.
now,
the
federal
control
was
relinquished
as
to
the
respondent
in
june
1945,
it
was
approximately
10
months
after
they
were
first
seized.
after
the
war,
congress
established
the
motor
carrier
claims
commission
to
determine
whether
the
carriers
were
entitled
to
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
for
that
seizure
and
if
so
to
determine
the
amount
as
the
word
of
that
commission
to
the
respondent
that
is
an
issue
here.
the
commission
held
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
that
the
dominion
exercised
by
the
government
over
the
carriers
was
efficient
to
constitute
a
constitutional
taking
of
the
temporary
use
and
possession
of
the
physical
properties.
it
held
that
in
the
case
of
a
temporary
taking,
the
proper
measure
of
just
compensation
as
the
rental
value
of
the
property
for
the
period
that
was
taken.
and
since
the
respondent
here
would
have
been
free
to
lease
out
its
equipment,
trucks
and
trailers
individually,
that
rental
value
should
be
measured
here
by
the
rental
value
for
each
item
of
equipment
and
the
court
determined
that
those
rental
values
added
them
up
and
the
total
was
the
award
made.
now
--
and
that
award
represented
a
net
rental.
that
is
to
say,
the
rent
that
respondent
could
have
obtained
for
its
trucks
in
excess
of
all
operating
expenses,
all
depreciation,
as
those
cost
had
already
been
recovered
out
of
the
operating
revenues.
so
in
--
in
effect,
this
award
represents
pure
rent.
it's
a
return
on
investment
to
the
petitioner
for
the
use
of
his
property
for
the
10-month
period.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
how
it
is
characterized.
i
will
come
to
that.
i
--
i
simply
wanted
to
explain
how
the
commission
arrived
at
its
figure.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
for
the
loss
of
the
use
of
property
for
a
10-month
period.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
total
award
arrived
in
that
basis
with
$190,000.
the
parties
later
agreed
to
reduce
it
to
a
$130,000
and
$7000
which
represented
the
operating
income
during
the
tenure
period
was
credited
against
that
to
produce
a
net
award
of
a
$123,000.
interest
was
also
allowed
in
that
award
of
4%.
now,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
in
all
events
that
interest
element
is
taxable
as
ordinary
income
regardless
of
how
you
treat
the
principal
amount
of
a
$123,000
and
so
we
can
limit
the
discussion
here
to
the
--
the
principal
and
not
of
the
award.
but
we
do
not,
in
any
way,
challenge
the
commission's
award.
we
accept
the
determinations
on
which
it
was
based
namely
that
there
was
a
taking.
there
was
a
taking
of
a
temporary
use
of
the
property
and
that
the
rental
value
was
a
fair
measure
of
the
value
of
the
interest
taken,
namely,
the
right
to
occupancy
for
10
months.
our
position
is
simply
that
what
one
receives
has
compensation
for
the
use
of
one's
property,
whether
you
call
it
rent,
whether
you
call
it
just
compensation,
whatever
you
call,
it
is
ordinary
income
and
not
capital
gains.
now,
the
respondent's
contention
is
that
the
proper
--
that
the
gain,
this
capital
gains
under
section
117
(j)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
that
provision
treats
as
capital
gains,
any
gain
from
the
involuntary
conversion
of
property
into
money
and
respondent,
in
effect,
argues
that
the
--
a
right
to
the
temporary
use
of
the
property
is,
itself,
property.
it's
a
property
interest
and
since
that
right
was
involuntarily
converted,
the
requirements
of
117
(j)
are
met
--
are
met.
i
would
like
first
to
avoid
the
particular
problems
of
involuntary
conversions
and
take
a
case
of
a
voluntary
transaction
which
essentially
similar
to
this.
assume
a
case
of
a
homeowner
who
conveys
to
a
lessee
a
10-month
leasehold
of
his
home
in
exchange
for
$1000.
now,
i
take
it
that
even
the
respondent
will
agree
that
that
is
not
capital
gains,
that
the
--
the
$3000
they
received
in
exchange
for
the
10-month
leasehold
is
ordinary
income.
it
becomes
important
to
identify
the
reason
why
that
is
not
ordinary
income.
now,
the
general
definition
of
capital
gains
is
in
section
117
(a)
of
the
1939
code
which
defines
capital
gains
--
gain
on
a
sale
or
exchange
of
capital
assets.
capital
assets
have
been
defined
simply
as
property
held
by
the
taxpayer.
let
us
say
capital
assets
are
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there's
no
further
definition.
there
some
minor
exclusions
which
aren't
relevant
here.
so
if
and
my
hypothetical
example,
we
treat
the
leasehold
interest
that
the
homeowner
conveys
to
a
10-month
lessee,
has
a
property
interest
at
which
he
exchanges
for
$3000,
there
has
been
exchange
of
property
and
therefore,
literally
it
ought
be
capital
gains.
now,
how
to
avoid
that
result?
one
way
to
say
that
is
not
really
a
sale
or
exchange
is
really
a
lease.
but
that
--
that
really
assumes
the
answer
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
property
that
you're
talking
about
if
--
if
by
property
there,
you
mean
the
house
and
there's
no
doubt
that
they
haven't
sold
the
house,
and
it's
only
leased.
but
if
it
is
permissible
to
speak
of
the
short
term
right
of
occupancy
for
10
months
as
itself
being
a
property
interest,
then
that
interest,
the
right
of
occupancy
for
10
months,
he
has
sold
--
sold
or
exchanged
and
is
not
leased.
so
the
problem
is
--
is
what
things
you
treat
as
property
for
purposes
of
the
capital
gains
provisions.
what
kinds,
nature
of
and
duration
of
interest
qualified
as
property?
now,
as
i
--
i
suggested
there
are
many
purposes
for
which
you
would
treat
a
temporary
right
of
occupancy
as
property,
for
example,
to
require
the
payment
of
just
compensation
for
its
taking.
but
if
congress
meant
property
in
a
capital
gains
provisions
in
that
all
inclusive
sense,
there
would
be
nothing
else
but
capital
gains,
because
virtually
everything
we
think
of
--
and
as
ordinary
income,
usually
involves
a
property
interest
of
that
sort
that
would
be
the
subject
of
a
sale
or
exchange.
for
example,
a
--
a
stockholder
could
each
year
sell
his
property
right
to
receive
the
dividends
for
that
year
and
if
that
is
property
for
some
purposes
and
if
it's
property
for
purposes
of
capital
gains
provision,
that
would
mean
that
all
dividends
can
be
converted
into
capital
gains.
so
congress
did
not
use
property
in
--
in
that
broad
sense
and
the
courts
have
very
properly
limited
the
application
of
the
capital
gains
provisions
to
transactions
which
involved
a
more
or
less,
complete
conversion
of
the
taxpayer's
investment
in
the
underlying
asset
and
they
denied
capital
gains
treatment
to
lesser
estates,
lesser
temporal
short-term
estates,
which
are
--
are
as
it
where
carved
out
of
that
fee
interest,
which
the
taxpayer
retains.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
i'm
coming
to
that
right
now,
because
it's
important
to
know
why
the
things
would
not
qualify
as
voluntary
transaction.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
yes,
all
right.
now,
their
--
their
argument
is
the
result
is
given
because
the
transaction's
involuntary.
now,
there's
no
difference
however,
between
117
(a)
and
117
(j)
in
the
nature
of
the
interest
that
maybe
the
subject
of
the
conversion
to
produce
capital
gains.
now,
there's
not
even
a
difference
in
--
in
the
language.
117
(a)
applies
to
a
sale
or
exchange
of
property
and
117
(j)
applies
to
an
involuntary
conversion
of
property,
but
the
same
word
is
property
which
appears
in
both
and
is
the
controlling
issue
here,
of
what
is
property
that
can
be
sold
or
exchanged?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
no,
but
--
but
--
we
agree
that
this
is
a
--
an
involuntary
conversion,
but
i
--
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
it
has
to
be
an
involuntary
conversion
of
property
and
just
as
it
has
the
requirement
that
under
117
(a)
there'd
be
a
sale
or
exchange
of
property
and
when
i
sell
a
10-month
leasehold,
there
is
a
sale.
the
problem
is
not
one
of
its
being
a
sale,
these
is
a
sale.
it's
a
problem
of
what
is
sold
not
being
a
sufficient
interest
to
qualify
as
property
for
purposes
of
the
capital
gains'
definition.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
is
right.
that
is
right.
but
a
--
that
is
really
the
--
because
we
say
that
the
right
of
use
for
the
10-month
period
is
not
accorded
to
the
dignity
of
property,
though
it
is
just
compensation
purposes,
it
is
property
for
which
you
have
to
pay
just
compensation
in
a
lot
of
other
groups.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
is
right.
a
--
a
governmental
taking
of
the
use
of
their
property
for
10
months.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right
and
i
--
i
agree
with
you
that
the
use
of
property
for
the
right
of
occupancy
--
the
right
of
use
of
property
for
a
10-month
period
is
property
for
many
purposes.
so
primarily,
this
property
for
purposes
of
fifth
amendment,
but
it
is
not
property
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
used
in
117
(a)
or
117
(j).
if
it
were,
every
time
that
i
purported
to
sell
voluntarily,
a
10-month
leasehold,
it
would
still
be
property.
but
you
can't
define
property
differently
for
the
--
for
the
two
provisions
of
the
capital
gains
section
--
but
now,
i
can
clarify
this
somewhat
i
think
by
--
117
(j),
the
part
of
the
difficulty
is,
serves
three
entirely
different
purposes
and
i
think
i
can
show
you
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
kind
of
problem
of
--
of
the
kinds
of
interest
that
are
involved
in
the
--
in
the
disposition
or
conversion.
now,
the
first
purpose
of
117
(j)
which
was
added
in
1942,
the
first
purpose
related
to
the
treatment
as
a
capital
asset
of
property
--
of
depreciable
property
used
in
the
trade
or
business,
machines,
buildings
and
the
like.
now,
before
117
(j)
as
of
now,
117
(a)
had
excluded
such
property
from
the
definition
of
capital
assets.
the
reason
for
that
was
to
allow
businesses
to
take
ordinary
loss
deductions
when
they
sold
property
that
had
been
depreciated
and
part
of
this
was
justified
on
the
ground
that
the
loss
probably
represented
inadequate
depreciation
deductions
in
the
past
and
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
recover
that
in
full.
now,
in
1942,
congress
was
prevailed
upon
and
persuaded
that
that
was
no
reason
not
to
treat
as
capital
gains,
any
gain
on
the
sale
of
depreciable
business
property.
so
that
was
the
main
purpose
of
117
(j),
was
to
have
preserving
the
capital
of
the
ordinary
loss
treatment
on
sale
of
the
business
property
to
grant
capital
gains
treatment
on
a
gain.
in
effect,
it
made
business
property,
depreciable
business
property,
capital
assets
par
excellence.
they're
capital
assets
for
gain
purposes,
but
not
for
loss.
now,
the
second
problem
--
the
second
purpose
which
is
most
relevant
here
was
to
extend
the
same
kind
of
preferential
treatment
to
losses
arising
involuntarily.
now,
most
involuntary
conversions
do
qualify
its
sales
or
exchanges
--
a
condemnation
does
in
foreclosure.
before
117
(j),
all
such
involuntary
conversions
that
qualified
as
sales
or
exchanges
were
treated
as
capital
transactions,
both
loss
and
gain
wise
as
capital
gain
or
capital
loss.
of
the
--
the
thought
seems
to
have
been
that
it
was
unfair
not
to
allow
a
full
deduction
for
a
loss
that's
involuntarily
incurred
by
a
condemnation
or
seizure.
the
main
purpose
of
the
involuntary
conversion
provision
in
117
(j)
is
to
allow
full
deduction
of
the
loss.
we
say
it
didn't
change
at
all
the
problem
of
--
when
you're
entitled
to
capital
gain
treatment
on
gains.
and
i
should
say
that
there
is
finally
one
of
the
other
minor
purposes
served
by
this
provision.
there
were
some
kinds
of
involuntary
conversions
that
did
not
qualify
as
sales
or
exchanges.
primarily
that
was
the
destruction
of
a
house
and
the
receipt
of
insurance
proceeds.
that
was
not
a
sale
or
exchange,
now
that
produced
the
anomalous
result
that
if
i
sold
a
house,
$50,000,
i
had
capital
gain.
to
a
burn
down,
i
get
$50,000
insurance,
it
was
ordinary
income.
one
purpose
was
to
overcome
that
by
treating
that
kind
of
conversion
also
as
one
giving
rise
to
capital
gain
and
under
the
preferential
loss
provisions
of
117
(j),
loss
in
the
case
of
a
loss.
now,
we
think
none
of
those
purposes
of
117
(j)
go
at
all
to
the
problem
of
what
kinds
of
interest
have
to
be
converted
in
order
to
give
rise
to
capital
gains,
i.e.,
what
congress
meant
by
property
used
in
that
section
and
used
in
117
(a).
and
we
think
that
the
--
the
terms
mean
the
same
thing
in
the
two
sections
in
(j)
and
(a)
and
the
question
of,
if
the
interest
is
of
such
duration
that
upon
a
sale
of
it
would
not
give
rise
to
capital
gain,
then
likewise
when
an
involuntary
conversion
of
it,
it
does
not
give
rise
to
capital
gains.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
doesn't
--
doesn't
entirely
accurate.
the
reason
they've
got
this
large
award
was
his
claim
that
he
could've
rented
his
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
well
no,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
in
--
that
was
accepted
because
he
claimed
that
he
would‘ve
been
able
to
rent
his
property,
the
equipment.
but
the
government
argued
in
the
compensation
case
that
it
should
be
measured
by
going
concern
value,
which
would've
been
a
very
small
award
in
comparison
to
this
$195,000
award
and
to
really
odd,
this
is
kind
of
a
--
a
backtrack
into
their
position.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
this
would
even
be
in
lieu
of
rent
in
order
to
be
compensation.
this
is
a
payment
for
the
use
of
property
and
we
say
that
a
payment
for
the
use
of
property
is
ordinary
income
regardless
of
what
it's
in
lieu
--
what
else
he
might
have
gotten
in
fact,
but
for
the
taking.
now,
in
the
court,
we
--
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
should
be
reversed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
just
a
few
very
brief
comments.
one,
what
the
motor
carrier
claims
commission
held
and
all
that
it
held
was
that
the
taking
of
the
temporary
use
was
something
that
you
had
to
take
just
compensation
for.
it
is
the
temporary
use
in
itself
property,
principle
under
the
fifth
amendment.
our
problem
is
what
property
means
in
section
117
and
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
the
same
thing
and
in
fact,
it
cannot
mean
the
same
thing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
well,
he
is
entitled
in
all
events
to
recover
his
depreciation
whichever
way
you
view
it.
i
--
in
fact,
they
took
depreciation
at
the
time
that
he
now
--
they
now
plan
that
they
were
not
entitled
to.
if
they
were
not
entitled
to
take
the
depreciation
--
depreciation
at
the
time,
the
way
that
this
award
should
properly
have
been
figured
was
to
take
the
net
award
that
the
commission
gave
them,
add
on
the
depreciation
to
the
award
and
that
is
his
award
against
which
he's
entitled
to
offset
depreciation.
so
he
comes
out
with
the
same
net
figure.
now,
i'm
just
saying
that
the
improper
treatment
of
this
depreciation
item
washes
out.
the
award
that
he
got
was
net
of
depreciation.
the
$123,000
is
a
--
exclusive
of
depreciation.
that
was
a
net
return
upon
the
use
of
his
investment
for
the
10-month
period.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
there
maybe
a
question
about
the
time
that
he
takes
it.
under
his
theory,
he
would
--
he
would
offset
that
depreciation
in
the
year
the
brief
takes
the
award
into
income.
in
fact,
they
took
it
back
in
1944
and
as
i
understand
their
position
now,
that
was
improper.
but
if
that
were
improper,
he
would
be
entitled
to
take
it
in
the
year
1952
when
they
got
the
award
to
offset
the
depreciation
against
that
receipt,
but
that
would
wash
out.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
oh,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
he
recovers
depreciation
in
full
before
we
tax
anything
on
either
theory.
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
to
clarify
this
relationship
of
involuntary
dispositions
and
voluntary
dispositions.
if
you
take
an
ordinary
capital
asset
in
one's
home,
if
you
voluntarily
sell
it
then
your
gain
is
capital
gain
and
your
loss
if
any,
where
you
wouldn't
be
--
let's
take
a
--
a
share
of
stock.
your
gain
would
be
capital
gain
and
your
loss
would
be
capital
loss.
now,
if
that
were
involuntarily
converted,
the
government
seized
your
stock
holdings.
the
difference
is
that
while
your
gain
would
still
be
capital
gain,
any
loss
would
be
ordinary
loss
and
that
is
the
only
difference
between
a
voluntary
disposition
and
an
involuntary
disposition
and
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
statute
about
117
(j)
is
that
to
--
purports
to
make
any
other
distinction
on
a
basis
of
voluntary
and
involuntary
dispositions.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
any
--
any
receipts.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
any
receipts
upon
an
involuntary
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
seizure.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
and
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
was
the
purpose.
now,
as
i
say
the
crucial
problem
here
is
what
is
meant
property
in
117?
now,
the
statute
doesn't
define
it,
the
courts
had
to
do
that
for
themselves.
they've
looked
to
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
capital
gains
provisions
which
is
to
alleviate
the
tax
burdens
on
a
long
term
appreciation
in
the
value
of
an
underlying
asset,
not
a
current
return
on
the
use
of
one's
investment.
the
return
given
to
the
respondent
here
was
a
return
for
the
use
of
his
capital
investment
for
the
10-month
period
and
in
our
view,
that
cannot
be
a
capital
gain.
thank
you.
