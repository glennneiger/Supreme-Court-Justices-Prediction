justice
hugo
l.

you
mean
if
you
have
a
truck
that's
worth
$2000,
the
government
takes
it
six

and
how
would
you
--
how
would
--

(voice

what
you
gain
when

back
--
justice

is
a
capital
gain?

if
you
have
rented
it,

have

for
the
same
amount.

i
--
i'm
forgetting
the
question
of
ordinary
income.
what
is
your
capital
gain
though?
how
do
you
compute
that
standard?
how
do
you
use
the
standard
of
what
you
get?

being
a
capital
gain
which
means
if
you
get
that
much
more
money,
capital
that
--
justice
hugo
l.

out
of
the
same
piece
of
property.
justice
