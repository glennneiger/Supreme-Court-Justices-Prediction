justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
leasehold
interest
was
seized
by
the
government,
so
that
be
a
capital
gain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
this,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
would
it
--
that
so
far
as
the
leasehold
in
the
--
in
the
possession
of
the
lessee
is
concerned,
the
renter
--
the
rental,
of
course,
would
be
property,
but
does
that
make
it
a
capital
gain
because
leasehold
is
property
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
it's
property,
does
that
make
no
difference?
the
nature
of
the
property
is
the
rental
value
in
displacing
the
real
lessee
and
making
the
government
the
lessee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
seem
to
suggest
that
because
it's
--
because
compensation
must
be
paid
for
under
the
fifth
amendment,
therefore,
it's
capital
gain.
is
that
--
that's
the
equation,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
although
the
amount
you
may
get
maybe
just
what
he
would
be
paying
out
in
order
to
get
another
piece
of
the
property
which
he
--
for
which
he
pays
--
which
he
left
on
a
lease?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
must
be
so
as
a
matter
of
--
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
statutory
--
statutory
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
got
any
inherence
then,
as
you
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
the
amount
--
although
the
amount
that
the
government
has
to
pay
is
the
rental
value
that
the
original
lessee
paid
and
the
only
thing
that's
happened
is
that
the
government
becomes
the
lessee
instead
of
the
displaced
value.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
guess
that's
the
capital
gain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
--
if
the
statute
says
so,
that
simply
means
that
the
government
--
that
congress
has
made
that
kind
of
a
tax
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
any
doubt
in
the
--
in
the
laundry
case,
kimball
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
doubt
that
property
was
taken?
all
--
all
that
he
had
was
taken
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
year
to
year.
but
is
the
statute
--
does
the
statute
make
that
equation
on
which
the
whole
argument
rests?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
any
exercise
of
the
eminent
domain
power,
that
the
consequences
of
any
such
exercise
constitute
the
capital
gains.
justice
felix
frankfurter
shall
be
treated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
words
that
make
that
--
that
require
me
to
hold
that?
just
because
i
don't
think
they
would,
as
you
get
anywhere
in
disputing
whether
this
was
a
property,
of
course,
it
was
property
any
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
disputable
that
this
was
a
compulsory
taking?
now,
that
it
goes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
was
the
recognized
gains
nearly
means
the
money
you
get?
is
that
all
that
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
in
a
lease
case,
suppose
in
the
westinghouse
case.
i've
forgotten
what
the
facts
were
but,
suppose
an
outstanding
lease
of
10
years
and
the
government
takes
a
lease
exercising
of
power
eminent
domain,
take
a
lease
from
--
beginning
with
1941
from
the
time
we
have
entered
the
war,
year
by
year,
to
say,
how
would
you
deal
with
that
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well
now,
how
do
you
deal
with
it
under
this
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
that
--
suppose
the
lease
--
suppose
the
interest
which
the
government
which
is
exactly
from
the
government,
it's
a
little
more
than
he
would
have
had
to
pay,
if
he
kept
it
in
under
his
own
lease,
then
that
would
be
of
capital
gain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
you
do
not
find
any
significance
or
at
least,
nothing
like
the
significance
that
judge
(inaudible)
found
in
the
phrase,
“capital
asset.”
meaning
by
that,
as
we
found,
that
the
capital
asset
is
really
the
exclusion
of
the
whole
world
from
that
piece
of
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
he
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
doesn't
the
very
phrase,
capital
asset,
conversion
of
capital
asset
were
usually
associated
with
capital
assets
exclusiveness
of
--
for
the
rest
of
the
world,
enjoyment
excluding
the
rest
of
the
world
and
the
ultimate
permanence
of
construction
of
property
and
not
a
temporal
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
--
that
wouldn't
be
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
make
a
difference
if
i
lease
the
truck
for
a
year
which
has
a
normal
life
of
what,
four
year,
whatever
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
that
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
enjoyment
of
that
property
for
a
year
was
where
the
voluntary
or
involuntary
conversion
of
a
capital
asset
to
my
use,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
the
trucks
belong
to
the
united
states
thereafter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
they
do
--
would
they
do
what
they
will
with
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
will
do
that
first.
they
might
do
all
that
for
a
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
a
normal
course
of
life,
the
truck
had
four
years.
and
the
government
says
release
this
for
a
year.
you
wouldn't
say
that
was
an
acquisition
of
a
capital
asset
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
whether
it's
voluntary
or
involuntary
can't
determine
whether
it's
the
capital.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
contrary
argument
--
the
contrary
argument
changes
the
term.
it
makes
the
term
capital
gain
the
equivalent
of
any
involuntary
conversion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
receipts
upon
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
propulsion.
