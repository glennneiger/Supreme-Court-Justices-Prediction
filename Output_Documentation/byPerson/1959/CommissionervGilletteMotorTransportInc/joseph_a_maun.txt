mr.
joseph
a.
maun
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
prior
to
now
and
these
cases
in
the
lower
court,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
had
resisted
what
they
apparently
now,
concede
before
this
court
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
taking
and
that
there
was
an
involuntary
conversion
and
that
the
award
was
not
received
as
anything
except
rent.
i
take
it
now
that
they
concede
that
the
amount
received
was
merely
measured
by
rental
value
which,
of
course,
is
exactly
what
the
motor
carriers
claims
commission
held
and,
of
course,
it's
obvious
under
the
fifth
amendment,
award
cannot
be
as
a
result
of
income,
it
has
to
be
something
that
is
awarded
on
account
of
a
property
interest
converted.
now,
what
the
government
is
claiming
here
is
exactly
the
same
thing
that
they
claimed
before
the
motor
carriers
commission.
and
in
the
petitions
to
that
commission
which
was
set
up
specifically
by
congress
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
these
claims,
the
--
each
of
these
103
carriers
claim
that
the
government
took
their
property
and
the
answer
of
the
government
in
each
and
everyone
of
these
cases
was
there
was
no
taking
of
the
petitioner's
property
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
motor
carriers
commission
held
that
each
and
everyone
of
these
cases
that
as
of
1201,
on
august
12,
1941,
the
petitioner's
property,
its
transportation
system,
all
of
its
properties
were
taken
for
public
use
by
the
united
states,
which
require
the
payment
of
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
think,
of
course,
that
this
is
not
the
place
to
go
and
do
whether
the
amount
of
the
award
was
too
low
or
too
large.
at
least
that
was
determined
by
this
commission
specifically
set
up
for
that
purpose.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
exact
terminology
of
the
order
as
of
12:01
a.m.
on
august
12th,
1944,
that
the
petitioner's
transportation
system
and
all
of
its
property
were
taken
for
public
use
by
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
the
government
has,
of
course,
argued
in
the
lower
court
as
they
did
here
that
this
constituted
nothing
but
regulation
or
control
of
the
petitioner's
property
or
the
use
of
petitioner
property.
now,
that
also
was
a
--
was
a
claim
that
the
government
made
before
the
motor
carriers
commission
and
the
motor
carriers
commission
specifically
passed
on
that
question
and
doing
so
it
stated,
“the
government
says
that
such
interference
this
petitioner
may
have
encountered
from
government
action
did
not
amount
to
a
taking
of
its
property,
but
merely
to
regulation.
to
place
any
such
construction
on
the
said
acts
done
by
the
federal
manager
would
be
to
belie
the
statements
contained
in
the
executive
order
and
the
orders
issued
there
under.
now
this
case,
just
exactly
like
cases
that
this
court
considered
during
world
war
ii,
where
there
was
federal
seizure
of
the
coal
mines
for
instance
in
the
john
l.
lewis
case
are
exactly
the
same
statement
was
made
in
that
case
by
the
government
--
by
the
representing
case
of
mr.
lewis
and
this
court
held
that
the
fact
that
private
managers
need
in
control
of
the
mines
did
not
in
anyway,
whatsoever,
limit
the
fact
that
government
was
testing
the
property.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
mr.
chief
justice,
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
adopted
the
same
view
that
the
government
has
pressed
and
that
is
that
the
--
what
government
did
in
this
case
was
merely
take
over
control
in
regulation
of
these
carriers.
in
the
eighth
circuit
opinion,
it
states,
“it
--
it
took
limit
to
possession
in
control
of
petitioner's
transportation
system
and
other
property
used
therewith.”
but
it
specifically
left
titles
to
the
properties
and
in
the
other
assets.
now,
that
is
the
very
same
argument
made
in
the
mine
workers
case
and
i'll
just
quote
to
you
just
a
statement
made
--
made
by
justice
black
in
that
case
and
he
said
that,
“the
fact
that
it
--
it,
talking
about
the
government,
utilized
the
managerial
forces
of
the
private
owners
does
not
detract
from
the
government's
complete
authority
for
whatever
control,
the
government
agents
delegated
to
the
private
managers,
so
as
the
agents
have
full
power
to
take
away
and
exercise
themselves.”
now,
perhaps
the
eighth
circuit
was
misled.
i
argued
the
case
there
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
i
would
concede
that
i
did
not
brief
it
as
well
in
the
eight
circuit
as
i
did
what
i
got
to
the
fifth.
the
argument
had
made
--
has
been
made
time
and
time
again
that
this,
an
involuntary
conversion
provision,
the
117
(j),
cannot
apply
because
title
or
it
wasn't
taken,
all
he
had
was
use.
well,
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
cases.
that
are
two
ways
in
which
a
government
can
proceed
when
it
takes
property
under
it's
--
even
their
main
authorities,
in
the
(inaudible)
cases,
these
cases
were
--
was
rules
are
set
forth.
one
way,
the
government
can
enter
into
--
and
take
property
by
seizure
as
it
did
in
this
case.
and
this
is
typically
a
case
of
seizure
as
pointed
out
by
justice
frankfurter
in
the
youngstown
case
where
he
specifically
states
that
midwest
takeover
cases
--
this
typical
case
of
seizures.
the
other
way
is
that
the
government
can
follow
ordinary
court
procedures,
go
in
and
take
a
declaration
and
have
a
declaration
of
title
made
through
that
way.
on
the
latter
situation,
of
course
then,
there
is
a
sale
or
exchange
title
passes.
but
in
either
case,
the
government
has
taken
power,
a
property
under
its
eminent
domain
authorities.
now,
there
was
a
time
as
government
counsel
pointed
out
that
there
had
to
be
a
sale
or
exchange
in
order
for
the
involuntary
conversion
provisions
of
117
to
apply.
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
held
that
proceeds
derived
from
insurance
policies,
as
result
of
fire,
were
not
entitled
the
capital
gain
treatment.
well,
as
a
result
of
that
decision,
congress
amended
the
law
and
at
that
time
we
were
in
the
brink
of
going
into
world
war
ii
and
there
were
hearings
in
congress
on
what
was
happening
to
private
property
as
a
result
of
war
time
seizures
and
requisitions?
and
our
brief
contains
a
considerable
amount
of
materials
relative
to
those
hearings,
but
the
fact
is
congress
is
cognizant
of
the
fact
there
would
be
seizures
and
there
would
be
requisition
as
a
result
of
world
war
ii
and
it
was
right
at
that
time
that
at
117
(j)
was
adopted
as
amendment
to
117
generally.
now,
congress
specifically
established
the
motor
carriers
claims
commission
for
two
purposes.
one
purpose
was
to
determine
if
there
was
a
taking
of
properties.
and
the
other
purpose
was
to
determine
if
properties
were
so
taken,
what
should
be
the
amount
of
the
award?
now,
the
commission
specifically
set
up
for
this
purpose
heard
these
cases
and
it
came
to
the
conclusion
that
property
was
taken
and
that
award
under
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
granted.
now,
we
believe
that
the
cases
hold
that
you
shouldn't
look
to
the
nature
of
reward
as
made
by
the
commission
set
up
for
that
purpose
in
order
to
determine
what
the
tax
consequences
are.
we
do
not
say
that
the
motor
carriers
commission's
determination
in
(inaudible)
do
--
can
determine
the
tax
consequences,
but
we
do
say
you
must
look
to
that
award
to
find
out
whether
it
was
something
received
because
of
the
conversion
of
property
by
the
united
states
government.
and
that
authority
did
so
determine
that.
now,
on
the
(inaudible)
case
in
the
second
circuit
where
there
was
a
recovery
for
antitrust
damages,
capital
gain
treatment
was
accorded,
are
results
of
a
goodwill
being
destroyed.
now,
the
court
didn't
say
that
the
antitrust
suit
settlement,
itself,
determined
capital
gain
treatment
should
be
accorded,
but
it
did
say
that
the
decision
in
the
lower
court
which
hadn't
set
up
to
make
that
determination
did
determine
the
nature
of
the
judgment
or
the
nature
of
the
award.
and
in
this
case,
the
motor
carriers
commission
has
determined
that
this
award
was
for
property
values
transferred
from
this
petitioner
to
the
government.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
think
it's
the
leasehold
interest
that
were
seized
from
the
lessee
under
the
terms
of
100
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yes.
and
i
would
assume
it
would
be
a
capital
gain.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
as
i
understand
in
the
fifth
amendment,
compensation
can
only
be
made
as
the
result
of
the
taking
of
property.
now,
if
there's
a
contractual
arrangement,
either
it
could
never
be
a
suit
under
--
under
the
fifth
amendment
for
just
compensation.
just
compensation
in
decision
after
decision
and
held
can
be
awarded
only
for
a
property.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
you
take
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
to
my
notion,
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
because
section
117
(j)
says
that
if
the
taxpayer
received
money
as
a
result
of
the
involuntary
conversion
of
property
into
money,
then
capital
gain
laws
provision
apply.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
i
think
we
have
that
situation
in
many
--
in
many
examples
of
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
just
as
the
matter
of
statute.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
think
it
does
as
i
will
demonstrate
it
here
a
little
bit
later
that
because
of
the
unusual
situation
in
which
these
people
will
have
their
property
seized
by
the
government
finds
himself,
i
think
congress
have
that
in
mind.
now
--
and
the
government
here
urges
this
court
to
consider
this
as
rental
rather
than
as
a
--
as
an
amount
paid
for
property
taken.
it's
really
asking
this
court
to
relitigate
this
whole
issue
of
what
this
taxpayer
received.
now,
the
r-b
case
such
as
tried
before
the
motor
carriers
commission
took
seven
months
to
try.
there
are
--
or
1000
exhibits
and
there
were
100
witnesses.
i
don't
think
that
this
stage
of
proceedings,
we
should
put
go
back
in
to
relitigate
what
happened
before
the
motor
carriers
commission.
motor
carrier
commission
has
said
there
was
a
property
that's
converted
and
it
is
awarded
damages
because
of
that
conversion.
to
me,
that
should
end
the
matter.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
i
don't
know
if
i
can
visualize
every
taking,
but
the
once
i
could
think
of
would
be
--
would
come
within
the
meaning
117
(j),
yes.
it
--
it
specifies
seizures,
requisitions,
fire,
theft,
even
if
you
--
someone
stole
your
purse
and
--
or
something
like
that
kind
you
--
capital
gain
loss
provisions
would
apply,
provided
there's
a
recovery
or
some
kind.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
then
you
would
have,
of
course,
the
same
as
you
had
in
the
westinghouse
case
during
the
war
time
where
the
lessees
in
her
term
was
abolished
and
then
you
get
into
--
i
would
say,
yes.
the
same
rule
would
apply,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
of
course
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
no,
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that's
right.
because
there
are
many
cases
where
there's
a
loss
because
of
the
fire
and
the
government
consistently
heard
the
position
that
here
is
the
deduction
restricted
by
the
capital
loss
provision
or
need
that
she
were
in
the
other
foot.
it
works
--
work
both
ways.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
if
the
--
i
doubt
that
it
would
be
a
capital
gain
if
the
reduction
cost
basis
readily
an
ordinary
income
because
probably
he
wouldn't
get
as
much
as
this
cost
in
the
building,
but
he
would
be
given
a
capital
gain
or
loss
treatment.
in
other
words,
if
the
building
cost
$100,000
and
the
award
let's
say,
$10,000,
it
reduced
the
cost
basis
by
$10,000.00
and,
of
course,
they
will
only
have
$90,000
left
to
depreciate.
the
government
would
not
come
out
barely
on
that
kind
of
arraignment.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
don't
know
of
any
statute
under
which
the
government
could
take
an
involuntary
lease.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
then,
i'd
say
it
would
go
--
you
have
to
go
back
to
fifth
amendment
compensation,
the
only
way
it
could
--
it
could
work
out
under
the
decisions.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
i
think
this
court
had
said
so
in
its
opinion,
but
in
the
kimball
laundry
company
case
out
of
omaha
during
world
war
ii.
this
--
army
seized
the
laundry
down
there
for
a
year
at
the
time.
and
this
court
held
that
the
--
it
should
be
paid
at
rent
on
basis
of
the
year
at
time
plus
additional
amounts
for
taking
or
abolition
of
its
routes
and
i
would
think
that
again
would
--
could
have
--
would
have
necessarily
to
be
a
--
just
a
minute
compensation
and
capital
gain
treatment
will
be
accorded
to
it,
or
loss
such
ever
turn
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
think
it's
definitely
a
taking
of
property.
i
think
it's
the
only
power
the
government
has
is
to
take
property
and
i've
--
as
this
case
as
the
mine
workers
case
and
all
of
those
pointed
out,
they
held.
they
didn't
just
take
control.
it
took
the
whole
facility,
the
whole
mines
and
that's
why
in
--
in
cases
of
john
l.
lewis,
the
court
was
able
to
reach
the
decision
that
it
reached
because
of
the
fact
that
it
became
a
facility
that
is
complete
as
if
the
government
owned
it
and
seized
simple
title.
that's
what
this
court
opinion
says
in
the
--
in
that
very
case.
and
that
view
which
i
believe
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yes,
kimball.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
no.
it
says
it
shall
be
treated
as
a
capital
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
--
treated
with
such.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
--
but
very
well
as
a
result
of
a
loss
too.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
they'll
go
both
ways.
now
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
entering
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
if
during
the
taxable
year,
the
recognized
gains
of
what
you're
saying
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i'm
reading
from
the
government's
brief
page
31.
“if
during
the
taxable
year,
the
recognized
gain
upon
sales
or
exchanges
of
property
used
in
trade
or
business
plus
the
recognized
gains
from
a
compulsory
or
involuntary
conversion
as
a
result
of
destruction
in
the
whole
or
in
part,
theft
or
seizure
or
an
exercise
of
power
of
requisition
or
condemnation
or
the
threat
or
eminence
thereof,
of
property
used
in
a
trade
or
business
and
capital
assets
held
for
more
than
six
months
into
other
property
or
money,
then
it
shall
be
considered
as
gains
and
losses
from
sales
or
exchange.”
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
say
that
it's
a
conversion
of
property
into
money
because
we
have
stipulated
that
these
trucks
were
depreciable
property.
they
stipulated
that
they
were
used
in
a
trade
or
business
and
there's
isn't
a
question
in
my
mind
that
the
government
took
these
trucks.
they
retained
them.
they
retained
them
as
if
owned
and
there
isn't
any
question
in
my
mind
that
after
10
months
of
use,
seven
days
a
year
in
a
commercial
operation
or
the
severe
role
or
over
the
roads
in
a
severe
midwest
winter,
where
the
government
gave
back
wasn't
what
it
took.
these
trucks
have
been
consumed.
they
used
them.
they
exhausted
them
and
perhaps
as
justice
brown
said,
some
of
them
may
have
been
returned
as
junk.
so,
something
was
going
out
of
that
truck.
they
didn't
bring
back
what
the
government
took.
they
consumed
property.
they
converted
that
property
and
they
converted
it
into
money,
that
as
result
of
the
award
given
by
the
motor
carriers
claims
commission.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
believe
the
decisions
were
uphold
in
their
--
the
motor
case
in
the
second
--
the
seventh
circuit
is
right
squarely
in
point
is
that
if
the
taxpayer
did
take
depreciation
on
it,
it
was
not
entitled
to
it.
because
the
government,
once
it
seizes
property
must
sustain
any
--
bear
any
loss
for
exhaustion,
depletion
or
wearing
out
of
the
property.
that's
--
that's
the
reason
for
a
fifth
amendment
award
is
to
replace
what
the
government
has
done
to
that
property.
the
record
here
shows
they
did
take
depreciation.
the
record
also
shows
the
profit
which
they
made,
they
took
in
income.
they
shouldn't
have
done
either
and
hindsight,
of
course,
we
can
see
now
what
should
have
been
done
for
those
are
hurry
up
days
and
that's
what
happened.
now,
they
should
not
have
taken
depreciation.
and
they
should
not
have
taken
the
profit
in
the
income
because
this
court
held
in
the
--
in
the
pee
wee
coal
company
case
that
when
a
government
seizes
the
facility,
it
must
bear
the
losses
and
it's
entitled
to
the
property.
some
are
exactly
the
same
executive
order
under
which
these
trucks
were
seized.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
computed
on
the
basis
of
the
cost
basis
of
the
truck
plus
what
you'd
get.
you
will
first
reduce
the
amount
of
the
cost
basis
and
if
there's
anything
left
over
and
above
that,
the
balance
is
subject
to
the
capital
gain
treatment.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
supposing
the
truck
costs
$10,000,
let's
say
and
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
the
government
has
seized
it
and
for
that
truck,
you
say
we
received
$15,000,
then
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
suppose
we
received
$15,000
for
that
particular
unit,
then
the
capital
gain
would
apply
there
between
the
$10,000
and
the
$15,000
on
the
$5000.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
why
you
take
into
account
your
--
the
adjusted
cost
basis
of
the
truck
on
your
books,
but
i
just
assumed
for
this
purpose
is
$10,000,
which
would
be
the
salvage
or
whatever
the
--
whatever
the
adjusted
cost
of
basis
happened
--
happened
to
be.
it
might
be
more
or
less
what
you
got
from
the
government.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
the
government
takes
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
supposing
the
government
gives
you
a
$1000
for
that
six
months
use.
you
would
reduce
your
cost
basis
on
the
truck
by
$1000.
in
that
case,
there
would
no
--
not
be
any
tax
at
that
time,
but
you
would
get
less
depreciation.
you'd
only
be
entitled
to
depreciate
on
$1000
then,
instead
of
$2000.
what
it
would
amount
to.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
the
general
motors
case.
it
took
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
under
the
statute,
i
would
say
that
the
lessee
would
have
his
lease
which
is
property
involuntary
that's
converted
into
cash.
again,
i
don't
think
that
he'd
have
any
gain
or
loss
because
on
question,
the
court
would
probably
give
him
just
what
he
was
paying
the
landlord.
that
would
be
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
damages
were.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
would
be
a
capital
gain
and
then
one
of
the
cases
before
this
court,
the
government
paid
less
than
be
with
the
general
motors,
then
the
lessee
had
to
pay.
(inaudible)
this
court
held
that
was
all
right
and,
of
course,
in
that
case,
the
government
insisted
it
was
a
capital
loss.
he
wouldn't
get
a
full
deduction
for
it.
now,
they've
argued
that
this
is
control
in
this
case.
so
the
fact
is
that
the
r-b
case
was
a
test
case
and
it
was
stipulated
and
then
we'll
find
it
in
our
record
that
this
case
was
the
follow
up
principles
of
r-b
case.
now,
in
the
r-b
case
just
to
show
you
how
far
the
government
went,
they
used
government
employees.
they
fixed
the
amount
of
the
wages.
they
discharged
employees.
they
ordered
discontinuous
of
routes.
they've
paid
the
employees
out
of
government
funds.
they
registered
these
trucks
as
government
property
and
they
sought
and
obtained
exemption
from
state
taxes
for
the
licenses
of
these
vehicles.
now,
that's
how
far
the
government
went
in
this
case.
they
treated
this
property
as
their
own
property
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
now,
under
those
circumstances
much
more
than
control
in
regulations
actually
taken
over
these
particular
units
and
i
--
i
think
as
--
as
there
any
policy
consideration
of
its
eighth
circuit
says
it
prevents
the
application
of
117
(j)
to
this
case,
the
all
around
(inaudible)
the
taxpayer.
here
is
the
person
who
is
dispossessed
of
his
entire
superior
route
103
of
them
in
the
midwest
area.
never
knowing
when
they
were
going
to
get
them
back,
not
knowing
whether
these
vehicles
are
going
to
be
returned
intact
or
as
junk.
certainly,
someone
who
has
his
property
seized
is
not
like
a
voluntary
lessee
or
lessor
which
the
government
points
out.
the
situation
is
entirely
different
and
this
court
itself
pointed
out
in
those
cases
during
the
seizure
of
world
war
ii
that
the
seizures
forced
an
indefinite
period
should
be
given
more
adequate
consideration
than
the
lessor
or
lessee
cases.
now,
this
taxpayer
didn't
receive
his
money
until
1952,
eight
years
after
the
trucks
were
seized.
it's
now
16
years
since
this
property
was
seized
and
the
taxpayer
still
doesn't
know
where
he's
at.
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
typical
situation
for
alleviation
of
the
hardships
that
are
imposed
on
a
taxpayer,
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
statute
was
intended
to
do.
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
statement
in
the
kimball
case
is
right
in
point
wherein
he
says
with
no
relation
to
the
tax
features
about
the
kimball
case,
but
relationship
to
the
amount
of
damage
that
should
be
awarded
in
temporary
seizure
in
the
(inaudible).
the
temporary
interruption
as
opposed
to
a
final
severance
of
occupancies
will
greatly
narrow
the
range
of
alternatives
open
to
the
condemned
need
that
is
substantially
increases
the
condemned
owner's
obligations
to
him.
it
is
the
difference
in
degree
wide
enough
to
require
a
difference
in
result
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
i
think
congress
knew
that
when
it
adopted
117
(j).
but
did
it
just
as
we're
going
into
the
war,
just
as
the
time
it
was
enacting
many
seizure
and
requisition
statutes.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
they
can
only
determine
it
by
the
whole
100%
as
a
capital
gain.
we
started
--
i
only
say
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
if
i
rented
it
for
the
same
amount
it
would
be
ordinary
income,
but
i
wouldn't
know
how
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
you
--
you
have
that
much
more
money,
but
you
have
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
you
don't
have
the
same
piece
of
property
the
more.
the
government
used
up
some
of
the
property.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
what's
that?
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
part
of
it
comes
back,
but
a
truck
that's
used
in
--
over
the
roads
for
years
isn't
the
same
truck
they
took
the
first
place.
and
you
--
so,
the
government
theoretically,
what
they
should've
paid
for
is
that
part
of
the
truck
which
they
used
up
during
that
year,
not
that
part
they
brought
back.
they
didn't
pay
anything
for
that,
but
the
part
that
they
took.
they
actually
took
it.
it
was
so
held
and
they
had
to
pay
for
it
and
what
they
paid
was
award
for
property
converted.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
was
capital
in
character.
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
theoretically,
they
should
all
set
one
another,
but
they
wouldn't
let
(inaudible)
cases
i
don't
know.
but
theoretically,
that's
the
purpose
of
limiting
the
main
award.
it's
the
offset
of
what
was
taken.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
that's
--
that's
the
view
he
took
of
it,
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
--
that's
probably
the
--
as
i
believe
your
opinion
in
the
general
motors
case
that
that's
a
shorthand
way
of
looking
at
it,
but
these
trucks
had
only
had
one
year
life
left
and
the
government
came
and
took
them.
there
wouldn't
be
--
the
government
would
never
argue
about
it
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
--
because
they
took
off
the
first
year
of
its
life.
they
said
that
makes
for
a
different
situation,
meaning
they
--
they've
taken
a
one
year
of
the
life
light
in
this
truck,
whether
on
this
end
or
whether
it
was
over
in
this
end.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well,
the
--
as
far
as
the
motor
carriers
commission
here
has
specifically
held,
there
was
a
--
a
taking
here
and
it
had
to
be
a
taking
of
a
capital
asset
regardless
of
what
the
nature
of
the
property
is.
it's
still
a
capital
asset
whether
it's
a
use
or
wherever
it
is,
it
only
argued.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
the
trucks
--
they
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
they
--
they
put
their
own
license
plates
on.
they
didn't
pay
state
taxes.
they
certainly
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
they
could
do
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yes,
i
would.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
if
it
was
involuntary
taken
because
then
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
thank
you.
