mr.
jess
larson
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
jess
larson
i
--
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
the
mix
up.
it
was
on
account
of
my
office
receiving
some
erroneous
information
and
not
the
fault
of
anyone
with
the
court
at
all
and
i
apologize
to
the
court.
mr.
jess
larson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jess
larson
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
review
the
history
of
this
case
very
briefly
from
the
stand
point
of
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
has
very
graciously
conceded
that
if
the
grand
river
dam
authority
a
duly
constituted
agency
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
can
show
that
the
waters
of
the
grand
river
were
appropriated
to
it
and
put
to
beneficial
use
that
then
the
grand
river
dam
authority
would
be
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
taking
which
has
been
accomplished
by
the
government
in
the
building
of
the
ft.
gibson
dam.
the
--
the
corps
of
engineers
in
1932
made
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
water
shed
of
the
grand
river
and
its
extension
on
up
into
the
state
of
kansas
where
it
is
called
neosho
river.
as
a
result
of
that
study
it
published
in
1935
and
made
available
to
the
congress
in
house
document
number
308
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
government's
brief,
likewise,
some
very
exhaustive
findings
and
some
recommendations.
those
recommendations,
were
generally,
that
navigation
is
not
materially
affected
by
the
activities
of
the
waters
in
the
grand
river,
that
the
production
of
power
on
the
grand
river
was
deemed
to
be
economic
and
that
if
it
were
economic
it
should
be
left
to
the
--
to
private
capital
to
exploit
and
--and
use
and
it
recommended
that
there
was
no
interest
that
there
be
no
interest
to
the
federal
government
insofar
as
flood
control
is
concerned.
this
report
was
made
after
extensive
hearings,
public
hearings
that
were
held
throughout
the
state
of
oklahoma.
this
was
a
big
public
issue
in
the
state
at
that
time.
having
received
the
decision
of
the
federal
government
in
the
form
of
this
recommendation
which
was
adopted
by
the
chief
of
the
corps
of
engineers
and
forward
it
on
to
the
congress,
oklahoma
decided
to
take
its
problems
to
itself.
and
it
thereby
created
by
legislative
act,
the
grand
river
dam
authority
and
the
court
below
and
its
findings
have
set
forth
generally
and
specifically
as
to
what
this
authority
constituted.
in
general
terms,
it
was
vested
with
the
control
of
the
waters
of
the
grand
river,
exclusive
control
of
the
waters
of
the
grand
river.
and
it
was
vested
with
an
exclusive
franchise
for
the
production
of
power
by
the
use
of
the
water
power
of
the
grand
river.
this
was,
in
our
contention,
legislative
appropriation.
this
was
a
legitimate
and
legal
act
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
acting
through
their
legislature
to
take
on
to
themselves
the
benefits
of
the
flow
of
the
water
in
a
nonnavigable
stream
with
in
its
boundaries.
mr.
jess
larson
i'll
come
to
that,
your
honor,
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
jess
larson
now,
in
19
--
mr.
jess
larson
that
--
they
could
use
it
for
purposes
of
irrigation,
for
storage,
for
making
it
available
to
municipalities
for
water
supply
and
for
recreational
and
conservation
and
other
purposes.
mr.
jess
larson
that
--
that
is
correct
to
the
--
mr.
jess
larson
of
all
the
waters
of
the
grand
river
as
they
flow
through
oklahoma.
mr.
jess
larson
well
the
--
the
--
it
--
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
the
united
states
has
never
exercised
any
control
over
the
waters
of
a
nonnavigable
stream
to
this
extent
unless
it
was
necessary
in
carrying
out
its
constitutional
right
to
control
navigation.
mr.
jess
larson
it
--
it
is
such
--
mr.
jess
larson
yes,
your
honor.
it's
subject
to
the
paramount
navigational
right
of
the
federal
government
and
we
concede
that
and
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
so
far
as
we
are
concerned.
now,
in
1935,
this
act
was
written.
it
was
copied
just
after
a
--
a
similar
act
which
had
been
adopted
for
the
state
of
texas
for
the
control
of
the
lower
colorado
river.
it
was
copied
as
a
matter
of
fact
almost
verbatim
and
has
been
patterned
after
that
in
a
good
many
ways
ever
since.
the
grand
river
dam
authority
thus
being
constituted
with
the
authority
to
borrow
money
in
order
to
--
to
develop
this
natural
resource
as
set
about
in
the
employment
of
engineers
and
they
developed
and
the
court
below
has
so
found
a
comprehensive
plan
for
the
beneficial
use
of
the
grand
river.
and
this
plan
which
is
set
forth
in
the
findings
on
page
6a
in
the
form
of
a
map
depicts
the
building
of
the
head
water
dam,
the
pensacola
dam.
this
is
the
larger
of
the
three
units
that
were
contemplated
and
the
key
unit
to
the
development
of
water
power
and
of
flood
control
incidentally,
on
the
grand
river.
the
second
dam
was
down
the
stream
some
50
miles
known
as
the
markham
ferry
dam.
and
the
markham
ferry
dam,
the
federal
power
commission
has
issued
a
license
to
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
the
--
they
are
to
the
grand
river
dam
authority
an
agency
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
they
are
in
the
process
of
going
forward
with
the
construction
of
that
dam.
the
third
unit
in
this
plan
which
was
adopted
by
the
authority
was
a
dam
at
ft.
gibson,
eight
miles
up
from
the
confluence
of
the
grand
and
the
arkansas
river.
at
the
site,
at
the
--
practically
the
exact
site
where
the
government
has
come
in
and
appropriated
the
water
rights
and
the
franchise
of
the
state
by
building
a
dam
there
on,
which
it
had
the
right
and
the
power
to
do
but
not
without
compensating
the
grand
river
dam
authority
for
the
loss
of
its
property
right,
is
our
position.
now,
the
government,
the
--
the
grand
river
dam
authority
not
only
adopted
a
plan.
it
set
about
to
acquire
the
lands.
and
it
acquired
all
the
lands
necessary
to
build
the
pensacola
unit
which
was
the
big
head
water
unit
that
would
be
the
big
reservoir,
that
would
release
the
water
to
flow
down
the
stream
to
turn
the
turbines
of
the
downstream
generating
plants
and
was,
incidentally
and
under
specific
authority
of
the
act,
cooperative
with
the
federal
government
and
the
corps
of
engineers
in
flood
control.
and
the
top
five
feet
of
that
reservoir
are
reserved
and
these
are
the
waters
that
are
controlled
by
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
corps
of
engineers
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general
and
not
the
power
too,
but
the
flood
control
waters,
the
release
of
the
flood
control
waters.
these
are
further
regulated
by
the
federal
power
of
commission
under
its
authority
which
extends
to
all
tributaries
of
--
of
navigable
streams,
likewise.
now,
the
grand
river
dam
authority
then
built
the
pensacola
dam
at
the
cost
of
approximately
$20,000,000.
it
put
in
its
hydroelectric
development
equipment.
it
obtained
rights
of
way
and
built
a
110
volt
transmission
line,
a
110
kv
transmission
line
down
to
the
site
which
it
acquired
for
the
building
of
the
markham
ferry
dam.
and
then
it
extended
this
transmission
line
on,
actually,
built
it
down
to
the
ft.
gibson
dam
site.
and
it
acquired
the
certain
fast
lands
and
rights
of
way
in
--
in
that
vicinity.
so,
it
was
moving
forward
to
--
to
accomplish
its
purpose
and
to
carry
out
its
plan.
legislature
had
given
it
authority
to
---to
borrow
moneys,
to
borrow
$10,
000,000
additional
money
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
building
the
markham
ferry
and
the
--
the
ft.
gibson
dam.
and
then
along
came
the
corps
of
engineers
and
made
another
study
of
the
water
shed
and
they
did
a
complete
reversal
of
their
previous
recommendation.
they
recommended
that
the
federal
government
do
exactly
what
the
grand
river
dam
authority
was
in
the
process
of
doing
and
had
already
partially
accomplished.
this
was
the
flood
control
act
of
1941
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
well,
there
was
naturally
a
great
deal
of
confusion
at
this
time.
i
might
say
that
in
--
in
house
document
number
107,
the
report
of
the
corps
of
engineers
that
is
referred
to
in
the
flood
control
act
of
1941
authorizing
the
federal
government
to
build
not
only
the
ft.
gibson
dam
but
the
markham
ferry
dam
and
the
pensacola
dam
which
had
already
been
built.
that
document
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
through
the
grand
river
dam
authority
was
already
attempting
to
accomplish
this
very
same
thing.
yet
in
spite
of
that,
the
corps
of
engineers
went
ahead
with
their
plan
to
superimpose
on
their
plan
upon
what
this
--
the
grand
river
dam
authority
was
doing.
mr.
jess
larson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jess
larson
the
second
report
was
in
--
in,
i
think
it
was
the
same,
it
was
1941
the
same
time
as
the
--
mr.
jess
larson
i
beg
your
pardon.
my
colleague
tells
me
that
that
report
was
made
in
1939
and
it
was
during
the
course
of
the
construction
of
these
properties.
but
the
flood
--
the
act
creating
the
authority
was
passed
in
1941
making
reference
to
this
report
and
at
that
time
the
--
the
pensacola
unit
had
been
built,
the
transmission
lines
had
been
built
and
the
dam
sites
had
been
acquired
and
the
--
the
borrowing
authority
was
there.
bonds
have
been
issued
which
pledged
all
of
the
property
rights
of
the
system
which
included
the
vested
water
rights
that
we
say,
we
acquired
by
legislative
action
and
the
exclusive
franchise
that
we
likewise
acquired.
now,
then
came
the
war,
the
emergency.
and
the
federal
government
took
this
property
over
under
its
emergency
powers,
which
made
it
impossible,
for
the
grand
river
dam
authority
to
proceed
as
long
as
it
was
--
as
these
properties
were
under
the
control
of
and
the
active
management
of
the
--
of
the
war
department.
in
1946,
the
properties
were
returned
to
the
state
of
oklahoma
or
to
the
grand
river
dam
authority
and
shortly
after
that
or
at
about
that
time
the
corps
of
engineers
started
forward
with
the
construction
of
the
ft.
gibson
dam
site.
now,
that
brings
us
up
to
our
statement,
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
current
status
of
this
project
as
we
see
it
and
of
this
law
suit
as
we
see
it.
now,
our
argument
is
a
simple
one.
we
contend
that
the
respondent,
the
grand
river
dam
authority
here,
had
the
right
to
use
the
waters
of
the
grand
river
dam.
that
they
were
vested
in
the
grand
river
dam
authority
and
that
they
had
been
appropriated
at
the
time
and
put
to
beneficial
use.
the
solicitor
general
has
conceded
that
if
that
is
the
case,
then
we
are
entitled
to
compensation.
that
is
the
view
that
the
court
below
--
mr.
jess
larson
yes,
your
honor.
we
--
we
rely
basically
upon
the
act
of
the
legislature
and
the
cases
which
have
adjudicated
that
act
which
i
might
point
out
here
start
as
is
provided
in
the
water
code
of
oklahoma
with
a
--
the
oklahoma
case
entitled,
city
of
tulsa
versus
grand-hydro
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
record,
i
think,
at
page
91.
mr.
jess
larson
yes.
mr.
jess
larson
yes
--
yes.
mr.
jess
larson
yes,
your
honor.
that
adjudication
--
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
adjudication
was
carried
on
and
--
and
affirmed
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
in
139
pacific,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
grand
river
dam
versus
grand-hydro
case
which
has
been
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general
and
which
is
likewise
cited.
now,
how
did
the
state
of
oklahoma
acquire
its
property
rights?
how
did
the
--
the
legislature?
how
did
the
people
of
the
state
of
the
oklahoma
acquire
any
right
to
permit
this
property
to
be
appropriated
in
the
manner
in
which
they
tried
to
do
it
by
a
legislative
act?
we
go
back
to
the
basic
document.
the
basic
document
is
the
patent
from
the
united
states
government
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
sets
forth
in
no
uncertain
terms,
that
the
lands
which
were
to
constitute
the
cherokee
nation,
the
lands
which
--
which
were
later
to
be
encompassed
in
the
indian
territory,
indian
territory
together
with
the
oklahoma
territory
on
november
the
6th,
1907,
being
brought
into
the
union,
being
vested
with
statehood
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states.
this
is
the
language
of
the
enabling
act.
this
is
the
language
of
the
proclamation
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states.
now,
the
--
the
patent
which
was
issued
to
the
cherokee
nation
on
december
the
31st,
1938
--
1838,
i
beg
your
pardon,
certainly
used
language
that
has
been
used
since
the
time
of
blackstone
to
convey
a
fee
simple
title
to
have
and
to
hold
the
same,
together
with
all
the
rights,
privileges,
appurtenances,
thereto,
belonging
to
the
cherokee
nation,
forever.
mr.
jess
larson
page

--
page
12
of
the
brief,
of
the
respondent's
brief.
now,
there
--
there
were
certain
reservations
in
this
deed.
those
reservations
did
not
affect
the
water
rights
or
the
titles
to
these
lands
except
that
it
was
provided
that
the
other
red
man
could
go
upon
lands
that
might
have
been
conveyed
by
this
deed
to
get
the
result.
the
--
the
federal
government
was
granted
the
authority
to
go
up
on
these
lands
and
build
military
roads
and
posts.
and
a
further
reversionary
clause
which
said
that
if
the
cherokee
nation
ever
ceased
in
being,
that
the
lands
would
revert
to
the
united
states.
in
1893,
the
act
of
--
the
first
allotment
act
of
the
cherokees
in
1893,
i
think
it
was
april
the
2nd,
1893,
we
have
cited
in
the
brief,
the
united
states
withdrew
by
act
of
congress
it's
reversionary
interest
in
these
lands
in
order
that
they
could
be
allotted.
and
under
that
authority
and
the
--
and
the
authority
of
subsequent
acts,
these
lands
were
allotted
to
the
members
of
the
cherokee
tribe
who
were
entitled
to
them
and
to
their
freedom,
alloted
in
several
and
at
the
time
oklahoma
became
a
state,
these
lands
had
been
so
allotted
and
title
was
vested
in
the
individual
indians
who
were
holding
that
land.
the
indian
territory
was
governed
by
act
of
congress
or
was
administered
by
act
of
congress
which
imposed
upon
the
indian
territory,
the
common
law
provisions
of
the
state
of
arkansas
as
set
forth
mansfield's
digest.
this
was
the
riparian
right
doctrine,
that
is
familiar
since
the
time
of
blackstone
and
insofar
as
riparian
rights
are
concerned.
and
this
was
the
law
that
governed
the
indian
territory.
oklahoma
territory
as
distinguished
from
indian
territory
had
been
authorized
to
set
up
a
legislature
and
govern
itself
through
an
appointed
governor
in
an
elected
legislature.
and
it
adopted
laws.
it
adopted
a
set
of
laws
which
are
referred
to
in
the
brief
and
now
appear
in
title
82
of
the
1952
annotated
statutes
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
are
a
basic
part
of
the
water
code
of
oklahoma
today.
in
section
2,
the
schedule
of
the
constitution
of
oklahoma
which
was
drawn
up
under
the
authority
of
the
enabling
act
which
made
oklahoma
--
made
it
possible
for
oklahoma
to
become
a
state,
provided
that
the
laws
of
oklahoma
territory
would
at
the
moment
of
statehood
be
enforced
in
the
new
state
of
oklahoma.
so,
those
statutory
provisions
of
oklahoma
territory
were
imposed
upon
and
became
the
laws
governing
the
water
rights
in
what
had
formerly
been
the
cherokee
nation.
in
oklahoma
versus
texas;
which
this
court
decided
the
boundary
between
oklahoma
and
texas,
in
the
case
which
is
not
cited
in
the
brief
the
brewer-elliott
oil
company
versus
the
united
states
at
260
u.s.
77,
both
of
those
cases
go
to
some
length
in
pointing
out
that
oklahoma
having
been
admitted
to
the
union
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states,
acquired
all
of
the
property
that
the
original
states
had
likewise
acquired
or
had
in
being
at
the
time
that
they
became
states
in
the
union.
and
all
of
the
rights
that
were
--
were
given
to
the
states
under
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
were
not
reserved
to
the
federal
government
itself
by
the
specific
terms
of
the
constitution.
the
--
the
--
therefore,
we
say
that
as
a
result
of
these
acts,
the
state
of
oklahoma,
the
people
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
own
the
control
of
the
waters
in
the
nonnavigable
grand
river
and
acting
through
their
legislature
they
appropriated
these
waters
to
their
agency;
the
grand
river
dam
authority.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
that
there
were
certain
reservations.
there
were
laws
which
restricted
the
--
the
conveyance
of
property
by
the
indians
who
had
the
fee
title.
the
nation
had
the
free
title,
cherokee
nation.
cherokee
nation
passed
this
free
title,
all
of
the
patents,
all
of
the
deeds
given
by
the
cherokee
nation
were
authenticated
by
the
secretary
of
interior
to
the
several
indians.
he
says
that
--
that
he
implies
that
there
is
some
further,
indefinite
extension
of
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
over
the
waters
of
the
grand
river
as
a
result
of
these
restrictions
on
--
on
the
conveyance
of
land.
well,
chief
justice
marshall
held
in
a
very
early
opinion
that
--
that
the
indians
were
to
be
looked
upon
as
--
as
a
--
as
being
in
a
sort
of
pupilage
category
as
he
calls
them.
the
guardianship
that
the
federal
government
has
exercised
over
the
indians
is
--
is
well-known.
well-known
to
those
of
us
from
oklahoma
who
have
struggled
with
--
through
our
--
all
of
the
titles
to
our
land
through
these
--
these
many,
many
provisions
of
law
and
provisions
of
treaties.
but
that
did
not
affect
the
fee
titles
of
the
land
as
wards
of
the
government,
the
federal
government
on
these
whole
certain
conditions
that
they
couldn't
throw
away
their
land
or
they
couldn't
have
it
stolen
from
them
or
they
couldn't
have
it
taken
from
them.
and
it
set
itself
up
as
a
guardian
and
--
and
all
of
the
administrative
acts
that
they
had
accomplished
was
for
that
purpose.
we
say
that
as
a
result
of
the
admission
of
oklahoma
as
a
state
in
the
union
on
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
that
we
acquired
the
right
to
do
--
the
legislature
required
the
right
to
do
what
it
has
done
here,
namely
to,
appropriate
these
waters
to
the
grand
river
dam
authority.
having
so
appropriated
these
waters
to
the
grand
river
dam
authority,
having
extended
to
the
grand
river
dam
authority
an
exclusive
franchise
for
the
development
of
power,
this
authority
has
vested
property
rights
in
the
water
and
in
the
franchise.
now,
had
it
put
it
to
beneficial
use,
we
--
we
don't
concede
that
under
legislative
appropriation,
it's
necessary
to
have
put
it
to
beneficial
use.
but
the
facts
of
this
case
will
clearly
demonstrate
that
the
water
was
being
put
to
beneficial
use
to
the
extent
that
this
authority
could
physically
move
forward
and
accomplish
the
things
that
it
was
set
out
to
accomplish
and
build
the
units
that
its
plan
called
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jess
larson
the
united
states,
mr.
justice
harlan,
has
built
the
ft.
gibson
dam.
it
has
prevented
the
grand
river
dam
authority
from
building
the
dam
which
it
had
planned
there,
which
it
had
brought
its
transmission
lines
down
to
serve
in
order
that
there
could
be
an
interconnection
of
the
power.
it
has
prevented
by
its
acts.
it
has
taken
the
vested
property
rights
in
that
dam
site
and
in
the
operation
of
a
dam
from
the
grand
river
dam
authority
unto
itself
and
we
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
compensation.
now,
the
question
of
how
much
compensation
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
jess
larson
well
--
mr.
jess
larson
but
it's
impossible.
if
--
if
that
is
true,
i
don't
think
the
government
concedes
that
point.
i
think
they
--
they
feel
that
they
have
--
that
they
have
the
control
over
this
water.
we
are
prevented
from
exercising
control
over
it
to
the
extent
that
we
cannot
utilize
it
to
carry
out
our
franchise.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
we
would
be
required
as
is
true
in
the
case
of
any
authority
or
any
private
company
if
we
expect
to
develop
power
on
--
on
a
stream
in
the
united
states,
anywhere
in
the
united
states,
we
must
go
under
the
provisions
of
section
27
of
the
federal
power
act
to
the
federal
power
commission
for
the
purpose
of
that
body
determining
whether
or
not
navigable
interests
are
involved
here
or
other
federal
interest.
and
if
they
are
so
found
to
be
involved,
then
we
have
to
operate
under
license
which
is
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
what
we
had
to
do
in
the
pensacola
case,
it's
what
we've
done,
in
the
markham
ferry
case
in
the
--
in
the
dam
that
we
are
about
to
build.
however,
this
is
a
regulatory
administrative
procedure
prescribed
by
an
act
of
congress.
it
does
not
concede
by
its
terms
the
federal
power
act
that
it
is
depriving
the
--
the
respective
states
of
exercising
their
control
over
the
waters
of
the
state.
this
control
which
is
exercised
by
the
federal
power
commission
is
that
paramount
control
which
transcends
the
--
the
control
which
the
state
of
oklahoma
may
use
because
of
the
commerce
clause
in
the
constitution.
now,
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
and
again,
going
all
the
way
back
up
to
the
rio
grande
case
and
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
cited.
that
these
power
insofar
as
navigable
streams
are
concerned
is
a
dominant
power
in
the
federal
government
and
we
do
not
dispute
that.
but
this
court
has
never
held
in
the
case
of
a
nonnavigable
stream
that
this
dominant
servitude
extends
to
the
property
rights,
the
taking
of
the
property
rights
without
compensation
in
a
nonnavigable
stream.
there
is
no
question
of
hydraulics
here.
there
is
no
question
of
the
navigable
stream,
namely,
the
arkansas
river
raising
the
water
level
to
deprive
water
rights
as
was
in
some
of
the
cases
that
had
been
before
this
court,
the
willow
river
case
as
an
example.
there
is
no
question
about
the
interest
in
the
flow
of
the
stream
of
the
navigable
rivers
as
in
the
case
of
--
of
the
twin
city
case,
for
instance.
this
is
a
vested
right,
property
right
which
was
vested
in
the
grand
river
dam
authority
and
which
the
government
has
taken.
and
which
we
say
that
the
government
must
compensate
as
the
court
of
claims
has
said.
now,
that
is
this
--
that
is
this
action
insofar
as
we
are
concerned.
we
think
that
the
congress
was
not
unaware
of
this
situation
when
it
passed
the
flood
control
act
of
1941
because
it
had
before
it,
what
was
going
on,
down
in
oklahoma
by
way
of
the
grand
river
dam
authority.
it
had
on
several
occasions
in
enacting
legislation
in
the
flood
control
act,
in
the
federal
power
act,
it
had
specifically
pointed
out
that
the
power
as
granted
under
those
acts
were
not
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
the
state
to
control
the
waters
of
the
state.
so,
it
is
not
inconceivable
that
the
congress
knew
exactly
what
it
was
doing
and
intended
that
the
grand
river
dam
authority
be
compensated
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
as
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
a
footnote
in
the
case
of
the
city
of
muskogee.
the
congress
passed
the
special
act
paying
damages
to
the
city
of
muskogee
for
the
damages
that
that
city
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
building
of
the
ft.
gibson
dam
by
the
federal
government.
a
property
right
of
the
city
of
muskogee
was
taken
as
a
result
of
building
this
dam.
we
say
that
the
property
right
of
the
grand
river
dam
authority
has
likewise
been
taken
and
we
are
prevented
from
carrying
out
our
plan
and
having
the
benefits
of
generating
power
and
selling
it
at
cost.
this
is
a
non-profit
authority.
it's
a
non-profit
by
legislative
act.
it
can
only
act
under
its
charter
and
within
the
limits
of
this
charter
and
can
only
act
for
the
benefits
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
which
it
serves.
now,
to
sum
up
--
mr.
jess
larson
i'm
--
i'm
not
familiar,
mr.
justice
stewart,
where
that
power
is
being
sold.
i
think
a
part
of
it
is
being
sold
to
private
utilities
and
a
part
of
it
to
the
south
west
power
administration
which
is
an
agency
of
the
interior
department.
mr.
jess
larson
no.
not
--
not
for
purposes
of
cooperating
in
that
manner.
i
--
i
am
under
the
impression
that
there
is
an
emergency
type
of
hook
up.
mr.
jess
larson
under
the
terms
of
the
act
creating
the
authority.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
now
this
is
--
this
is
a
--
a
real
loss
is
there
number
of
--
of
elements
of
loss.
number
one
is
that
in
order
to
bring
the
project
as
far
as
it
has
been
brought
to
date,
bonds,
revenue
bonds
under
the
provisions
of
the
authority
have
been
issued
and
these
--
these
--
the
property
rights
have
been
pledged.
as
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
--
if
property
rights
are
taken
away,
it's
conceivable
that
under
indenture
the
bondholders
might
have
some
action
immediately
against
the
authority.
so,
it
is
for
the
benefits
that
would
accrue,
that
would
go
toward
the
repayment
of
the
debt
already
incurred
and
toward
the
repayment
of
the
debt
which
is
to
be
incurred.
and
for
the
distribution
of
power
to
the
private
utilities
and
the
municipalities
and
the
rural
electrification
cooperatives
in
the
area
that,
otherwise,
have
been
deprived
of
dealing
with
the
grand
river
dam
authority
and
are
now
required
to
deal
with
the
--
the
corps
of
engineers
or
its
agency
selling
power
and
that
power
rate
is
somewhat
higher
than
the
rate
that
is
currently
being
charged
at
grand
river
dam
authority.
mr.
jess
larson
right
mr.
jess
larson
yes,
sir.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
the
equal
footing
argument
or
the
point
--
mr.
jess
larson
no,
no.
there
--
they
go
--
the
--
the
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
--
the
original
rights
in
this
stream,
whatever
they
were,
were
conveyed
by
the
federal
government
in
the
deed
to
the
cherokee
nation.
mr.
jess
larson
those
rights
have
been
reconveyed
by
the
cherokee
nation
with
the
approval
of
the
federal
government
to
the
individuals
of
the
cherokee
nation.
mr.
jess
larson
and
there
they
rest
whatever
the
riparian
rights
are,
rest
in
the
current
owners
today
of
the
property.
but
the
state
of
oklahoma
upon
becoming
a
state
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
13
states,
assumed
the
right
to
the
--
the
ownership
of
the
riverbeds,
of
the
navigable
streams
and
to
control
the
waters
within
its
port.
mr.
jess
larson
the
--
therefore,
resting
in
whom?
mr.
jess
larson
that
--
theretofore
--
mr.
jess
larson
therefore,
resting
in
the
case
of
the
cherokee
nation
and
the
indian
territory
in
the
lands
joining
--
abutting
the
--
the
grand
river.
they
were
controlled
by
--
they
--
they
rested
in
the
riparian
owners.
mr.
jess
larson
they
became
citizens
of
oklahoma
upon
statehood.
mr.
jess
larson
i'm
not
--
mr.
jess
larson
they
--
they
--
the
cherokees
got
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
got
the
title
from
the
united
states
government,
cherokee
nation.
mr.
jess
larson
that's
--
that's
correct.
now,
--
mr.
jess
larson
well,
the
--
the
equal
footing
is
held
in
the
oklahoma
versus
texas
case
at
258
u.s.
573.
states
that
upon
admission
of
a
state
into
the
union,
the
new
state
by
virtue
of
the
constitutional
rule
of
equality
among
the
states
becomes
as
was
each
of
the
original
states,
the
owner
of
the
soil
underlying
the
navigable
waters
within
its
boundaries.
this
was
as
far
as
that
went
in
the
oklahoma,
texas
case.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
i
--
i
--
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
here,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
by
virtue
of
its
becoming
a
state
on
equal
footing
had
the
right
to
control
the
waters
of
the
nonnavigable
streams.
we
do
not
--
the
word
ownership
is
used
by
the
court
of
claims
might
have
been
unfortunate
i
think.
it
must
be
read
in
light
of
the
decision
of
murphy
versus
kerr
which
is
cited
by
the
court
of
claims
that
it
is
in
trust
for
the
people.
the
water
is
running
water.
you
can't
go
out
and
grab
the
water
and
say
that
i
own
this
water.
the
state
can't
do
it.
an
individual
can't
do
it.
the
water
goes
on
down
the
stream
and
the
riparian
owners
have
the
right
to
the
continued
flow
of
that
stream
in
certain
jurisdictions.
but
the
state
of
oklahoma
had
the
paramount
right
to
exercise
control
over
that
water.
mr.
jess
larson
i
wouldn't
have
said
this
if
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
there
had
not
been
a
conveyance
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
for
the
indians.
i
think
that
under
these
circumstances
that
when
oklahoma
became
a
state
on
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
that
this
was
a
power
which
every
state
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
has
the
right
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jess
larson
well,
it
--
it
only
shows
that
the
federal
government
never
tried
to
reserve
any
rights
in
the
nonnavigable
waters
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
because
it
specifically
did
not
do
so.
mr.
jess
larson
i
--
i
--
mr.
jess
larson
it
--
it
is
my
position
that
the
equal
footing
admission
to
the
state
insofar
as
those
lands
over
which
the
state
could
control
that
it
--
it
assumed
the
authority.
it
had
the
right
to
exercise
control
over
those
waters.
now,
i
--
i
don't
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
in
public
lands,
there
are
no
public
lands
involved
here.
in
a
reserved
land,
there's
no
reservation
involved
here
that
--
that
in
any
--
any
property
rights
that
were
vested
in
the
united
states
would
--
would
still
be
in
the
united
states
as
they
have
in
many
of
the
western
states
and
which
brought
about
necessity
of
the
desert
--
of
--
of
the
desert
states
act
which
had
to
do
with
the
allocation
of
these
waters.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
i
--
i
say
that
if
the
lands
--
no,
i
don't
say
it
divested
the
united
states
of
any
riparian
rights.
it
might
have
been
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
in
any
of
these
lands.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
i
--
i
say
that
upon
admission
to
equal
footing,
the
state
of
oklahoma
became
clothed
with
the
authority
to
control
these
waters
and
to
control
the
waters
is
--
carried
with
it
the
authority
to
appropriate
the
waters.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
these
waters
were
the
not
property
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
the
--
insofar
as
the
lands
--
mr.
jess
larson
well
--
mr.
jess
larson
well,
the
--
the
land
was
owned
by
its
citizens
insofar
as
the
citizens
of
the
state
concerned
by
its
admission
to
the
--
to
the
union
on
an
equal
footing
if
it
was
clothed
with
the
right
to
exercise
control
over
the
navigable
waters
within
the
limits
of
--
of
what
its
own
constitution
could
provide
and
within
the
limits
of
the
federal
constitution
it
could
exercise
control
over
those
waters
as
a
result
of
it
being
admitted
on
an
equal
footing.
that
--
that's
--
that
was
what
i
intended
to
convey
to
justice
brennan.
mr.
jess
larson
that's
right.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
i
--
i
--
it
is
not
immaterial
insofar
as
fee
simple
title
is
concerned
and
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that.
i
--
i
meant
to
say
that
this
was
immaterial
insofar
as
the
rights
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
acquired
over
its
citizens.
mr.
jess
larson
i
think
we
are,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
i
appreciate
you're
clearing
that
point
out.
that's
exactly
the
point
that
i
take.
now,
if
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
were
true
but
for
some
vague
reason,
there
are
still
rights
in
these
waters
in
the
united
states
there
isn't
a
clear
title
in
all
of
what
was
indian
territory,
because
every
one
of
the
indian
nations
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
were
involved
in
the
same
way.
mr.
jess
larson
it
--
the
fee
simple
state.
mr.
jess
larson
no,
no,
the
fee
simple
title
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
was
conveyed
to
them.
now,
under
federal
acts
--
mr.
jess
larson
yes,
individually
by
name.
yes,
sir.
mr.
jess
larson
as
allottees.
mr.
jess
larson
that's
right.
they
--
they
--
mr.
jess
larson
in
the
case
of
the
cherokees,
it
was
110
acres,
40
acres
of
which
they
designated
as
their
homestead
and
--and
this
land
was
surveyed
and
set
up
described
in
the
patents
that
were
issued.
these
patents
were
issued
by
the
cherokee
nation
and
authenticated
by
the
secretary
of
interior.
mr.
jess
larson
particular
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
tracts
to
particular
land.
this
was
the
allotment
to
the
indians.
now,
what
the
solicitor
general
refers
to
as
the
prohibitions
against
the
conveyance
to
that
land
or
alienation
of
that
land
derive
from
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
over
these
indians
as
a
guardian
of
the
federal
government
and
not
to
the
title
of
the
property
which
they
received
from
their
nation
authenticated
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
riparian
right
and
so
far
as
they
exist
under
oklahoma
law
is
concerned.
mr.
jess
larson
and
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
there
is.
there
is
the
title
60
--
section
60
of
the
annotated
statutes
of
oklahoma,
1952,
which
tends
to
give
riparian
owners
the
normal
right,
common
law
right
in
the
flow
of
the
stream.
but
there
is
a
water
code
under
title
82
of
the
statute
which
provides
how
this
water
maybe
appropriated
and
taken
from
the
riparian
owners
and
put
to
other
uses
and
how
it
may
be
adjudicated
as
was
the
case
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
jess
larson
no,
i
don't
imply
that
at
all,
your
honor
--
mr.
justice.
mr.
jess
larson
i
--
i
contend
that
this
applies
only
to
these
set
of
facts
that
we
have
before
us
here.
here
is
an
instance
where
a
state
has
created
an
authority,
has
appropriated
the
waters
and
put
those
waters
to
beneficial
use.
these
are
the
circumstances
that
are
necessary
in
order
to
create
the
situation
that
we
say
it
is
deserving
of
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
we
--
we
acquired
the
land.
we
acquired
the
rights
of
way.
we
built
the
transmission
lines
of
such
size
and
capacity
that
they
could
carry
the
power
from
one
dam
to
the
other
and
redistribute
it
as
between
them.
we
formulated
our
plans.
we
issued
bonds,
pledging
the
revenues
from
the
entire
system
which
system
was
described
as
that
promulgated
by
the
engineers
in
their
plan
and
adopted
by
the
authority
to
constitute
three
dams,
the
pensacola,
markham
ferry
and
grand
river.
mr.
jess
larson
of
the
army
engineers?
mr.
jess
larson
well,
this
plan
of
which
i
speak
was
a
plan
of
the
grand
river
dam
authority.
the
army
engineers
drew
up
a
separate
plan
which
very
nearly
followed
as
nearly
as
i
can
ascertain.
mr.
jess
larson
no
and
in
further
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
hypothetical
case
which
you
--
which
you
have
put
to
me,
this
could
not
happen.
this
could
not
be
carried
out
as
the
solicitor
general
says
without
coming
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
obtaining
a
license.
and
if
the
federal
power
commission
determines
that
the
navigation
right
of
the
federal
government
is
paramount,
it
can
set
up
the
conditions
under
which
that
authority
must
operate
as
it
has
here.
and
thereby,
the
federal
government
exercised
its
--
its
control.
the
--
the
flood
control
act
has
a
--
has
a
plenary
statute
which
--
which
makes
the
misdemeanor
to
--
to
build
and
to
--
to
go
ahead
with
the
project
of
this
kind
with
--
if
it
--
if
it
interferes
with
navigation.
and
the
government
has
been
enjoined.
mr.
jess
larson
we
--
mr.
jess
larson
we--
we
--
mr.
jess
larson
we
--
we
do
not
contend.
we
do
not
contend
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
that
the
government
does
not
have
the
right
where
it
determines
that
navigation
is
involved,
that
it
does
not
have
the
right.
we
do
not
contend
that
it
does
not
have
the
right
to
go
and
build
these
projects,
to
prohibit
their
building
or
to
regulate.
we
do
not
contend
that
because
it
can
and
does
but
it
has
never
heretofore
gone
in
and
said
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution,
“we
can
take
your
property.
we
can
take
your
vested
water
rights
which
is
a
property,”
which
this
court
in
the
grand
river
dam
case
versus
grand-hydro
which
was
alluded
to
by
the
solicitor
general.
this
court
held
that
the
franchise
of
grand-hydro
had
been
given
to
the
state
of
oklahoma
was
a
property
right
and
that
the
grand
river
dam
authority
had
to
pay
and
it
did
pay
over
$600,000
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
this
court
and
a
retrial
of
the
case
for
farmlands
which
it
contended
it
should
only
pay
some
--
a
much
smaller
sum.
now,
on
nonnavigable
streams,
the
dominant
servitude
exercised
by
the
government
in
its
control
of
navigation
under
its
commerce
clause
has
never,
in
any
decision
as
i
can
find
in
this
court,
has
ever
been
held
to
apply
to
nonnavigable
streams
to
the
flow
of
the
nonnavigable
streams
and
that
is
the
distinction.
now
we
do
--
mr.
jess
larson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jess
larson
would
or
had
an
additional
work
if
--
if
--
mr.
jess
larson
that
conceivably,
that
work
would
have
been
greater
had
the
project
been
completed
with
all
three
dams.
mr.
jess
larson
yes,
sir.
mr.
jess
larson
to
that
extent,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
have
not
gone
into
that
question
and
i
don't
think
i
can
intelligently
answer
it
for
you,
except
i
can
say
this
that
the
question
of
compensation
is
not
before
us
here
today.
mr.
jess
larson
if
the
right
to
--
the
right
to
compensation.
mr.
jess
larson
the
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
the
right
if
we
have
no
right
to
compensation,
of
course,
we
--
we
can
get
no
compensation.
mr.
jess
larson
yes,
i
--
i
think
i
understand,
mr.
--
mr.
jess
larson
well,
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
agree
with
you
under
the
provisions
of
the
monongahela
case,
for
instance,
of
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
there,
this
court
held
that
a
franchise
was
taken
and
used
by
the
federal
government
which
is
comparable
to
this
case
here.
the
--
the
same
use
has
been
put
to
it.
mr.
jess
larson
and
as
--
as
the
grand
river
dam
authority
would
have
put
to
it
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
property
right
and
we
were
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
entitled
to
compensation.
mr.
jess
larson
yes,
sir.
mr.
jess
larson
no.
as
i
remember
that
case,
the
united
states
under
its
--
under
its
navigation
authority
could
have
operated
those
locks
and
the
--
and
the
locks
is
what
they
were
and
the
pertinences
were
without
the
state
franchise
which
they
vested.
mr.
jess
larson
well,
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
i
can't
help
your
troubled
mind
on
that
anymore.
my
time
has
expired
and
i
only
want
to
--
practically
expired
--
sum
up
by
referring
again
to
the
grand
river
dam
versus
grand-hydro
case
which
was
settled
in
this
court,
settled
by
this
court.
this
court
held
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
had
issued
a
--
a
vested
franchise
right
in
grand-hydro
and
that
it
had
to
pay
for
it
on
the
basis
of
what
that
right
was
worth
and
not
on
the
basis
of
what
the
land
alone
was
worth.
mr.
jess
larson
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
we
could
not
do
so
without
ownership
of
a
dam
site.
we
--
mr.
jess
larson
we
had
a
dam
site.
mr.
jess
larson
it's
--
it
--
there
was
--
engineering-wise,
there
was
one
logical
dam
site.
mr.
jess
larson
and
--
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
that
is
the
one
that
the
government
took.
mr.
jess
larson
that's
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
jess
larson
the
question
of
compensation
has
not
yet
been
settled.
mr.
jess
larson
no.
mr.
jess
larson
--
not
so
far
as
that
dam
site
is
concerned.
mr.
jess
larson
the
--
the
amount
--
mr.
jess
larson
--
of
compensation.
mr.
jess
larson
there
is
a
condemnation
proceeding
going.
let
me
check
this
a
minute.
oh,
i'm
--
i
--
there
--
the
--
the
--
i
was
confused.
we
have
in
litigation
and
condemnation,
the
markham
ferry
dam
site.
there
is
no
litigation.
there
is
no
70
acres
involved
insofar
as
the
ft.
gibson
dam
site.
mr.
jess
larson
we
had
a
dam
site
at
ft.
gibson.
mr.
jess
larson
i
--
i
am
told
and
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
am
told
by
mr.
boydstun
who
is
the
general
counsel
of
the
authority
that
we
had
not
yet
acquired
the
dam
site.
we
had
only
acquired
the
right
of
way
to
a
dam
site
and
had
built
our
power
lines
or
our
transmission
lines
over
that
right
of
way.
mr.
jess
larson
we
did
not
--
mr.
jess
larson
we
--
we
had
not
acquired
--
grand
river
dam
authority
had
not
acquired
the
physical
dam
site.
it
had
surveyed
it
and
selected
but
had
not
acquired
it.
mr.
jess
larson
they
did
not
acquire
it
from
grand
river
dam
authority.
mr.
jess
larson
thank
you
very
much.
