mr.
j.
lee
rankin
counsel,
wouldn't
otherwise
be
present
today.
there
are
no
way
to
report
the
present
time
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
must
compensate
a
state
authority
for
a
state
franchise
to
build
a
dam
on
a
nonnavigable
river
in
oklahoma.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
a
nonnavigable.
and
also,
whether
is
required
to
compensate
that
same
authority
for
water
rights
that
it
claims
to
have
vested
under
state
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
all.
this
case
does
not
involve
any
kind
of
physical
property
in
the
sense
of
fast
lands
or
overflowing
fast
lands
or
riparian
lands
of
any
kind
that
all
of
that
part
has
been
either
settlers
in
the
process
of
--
of
payment,
so
that
there's
no
issue
between
the
parties
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
partially
and
partially
by
--
i
think
there
are
some
agreements
about
part
of
it,
but
there
is
no
problem
about
it.
no
issue
in
the
case
about
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
no
issue
in
the
case
about
it.
and
the
claims
here
are
whether
or
not,
a
state
franchise.
that
is
this
--
the
permit
to
build
a
dam
that
the
state
issued
has
to
be
compensated
for
when
the
united
states
builds
the
dam
itself
and
whether
or
not
there
are
vested
water
rights
that
the
respondent
has
that
have
to
be
compensated
for.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
are
riparian
rights
like
the
niagara
mohawk
case
that
you
worked,
niagara
mohawk,
you
recall
what
international
paper
company
had
and
they
had
separated
from
the
land,
those
riparian
rights
and
the
court
held
that
since
congress
contemplated,
they
should
be
compensated
for,
that
they
would
have
to
be
paid
for.
now,
those
are
just
pure
water
rights
as
such.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
in
this
case,
they
do
not
claim
that
they
are
riparian
water
rights.
they
claim
that
they're
appropriate
water
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
they're
still
separate
and
apart,
if
they
were
--
the
united
states
would
recognize
that
if
they
were
vested
water
rights
that
someone
held,
that
legally
held
under
law
that
they
would
have
to
be
obtained
by
condemnation
or
purchase
or
otherwise.
in
this
case,
the
united
states
takes
the
position
that
they
--
the
state
franchise
is
not
necessary
to
the
united
states
in
building
a
dam.
it's
worthless
to
it,
because
the
united
states
has
the
power,
the
courts
held,
to
proceed
in
under
the
federal
power
act
and
build
the
dam
itself
and
in
fact
no
one
else
can
do
it,
unless
the
united
states
in
this
particular
situation
permits,
and
that
the
water
rights
they
have
never
acquired.
i'll
try
to
get
down
to
that.
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
350.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that's
the
position.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that's
right
and
that's
the
position
of
the
government.
they
--
the
position
of
the
government
here
is
that
they
don't
have
any
such
water
rights,
but
if
they
have
they
would
be
compensable
property
because
they
are
a
form
of
real
property
and
incorporeal
hereditament.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
fast
lands.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
government
does
not
claim
that
it
has
made
compensation
for
that
and
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
these
lands
are
--
that
are
involved
here
or
--
are
not
riparian
in
any
way.
the
authority
had
other
lands
that
the
government
felt
necessary
to
acquire,
but
the
lands
where
the
dams
they
build,
as
i
understand
it,
were
not
the
lands
that
are
the
fast
lands
between
these
parties.
there
are
no
riparian
lands
involved,
none
whatsoever.
now,
i
--
i
think
during
my
argument,
i
can
reach
your
point,
but
i
would
like
to
postpone
that
question
because
i
--
in
that
form.
the
--
the
grand
river
is
conceded
to
be
a
nonnavigable
river
within
the
state
of
oklahoma.
and
there
were
--
there
was
provision
for
three
dams
to
be
built,
first,
by
federal
authority
and
then
the
state
authority.
a
creature
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
was
created
and
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
private
corporation
under
the
holdings
of
the
oklahoma
court
for
many
purposes,
but
it
is
a
state
creature
and
then
as
an
authority
in
developing
this
part,
was
given
the
power
to
build
dams
on
this
grand
river,
nonnavigable
river.
it
did
proceed
under
a
state
license
and
then
a
federal
license
to
build
the
pensacola
dam,
which
was
the
first
one
or
the
highest
up
dam
on
the
grand
river.
the
dam
in
--
there
are
three
dams,
the
middle
dam
is
the
markham
ferry
and
then
--
the
dam
in
issue
here
is
the
ft.
gibson
dam,
which
is
the
lowest
point.
this
point
is
within
eight
miles
of
the
arkansas
river
which
everyone
concedes
is
a
navigable
river,
according
to
all
the
definitions.
so,
it's
within
eight
miles
of
the
confluence
of
the
grand
river
to
the
arkansas
river
that
this
whole
dispute
is
about.
that's
where
this
dam
in
issue
was
built.
now,
when
they
wanted
to
build
the
pensacola
dam,
the
first
one,
highest
up
on
the
river,
the
authority
filed
an
application
with
the
federal
power
commission
and
they
said,
“this
will
have
no
substantial
effect
upon
navigation.
and
therefore,
we're
giving
you
notice
of
our
intent
to
build
this
dam,
but
we
don't
need
a
license.”
the
federal
power
commission
examined
the
question
and
they
concluded
that
it
would
have
a
substantial
effect
upon
navigation.
and
therefore,
they
would
have
to
have
a
federal
license.
and
they
granted
a
federal
license
to
them
to
build
the
pensacola
dam
on
the
highest
point.
so
that
they
--
the
federal
power
commission
had
decided
that
it
would
have
a
substantial
effect
on
navigation.
and
these
three
dams
were
part
of
a
general
plan
for
improvement
of
navigation
in
this
arkansas
basin.
it
was
done
under
the
corps
of
engineers
and
the
authority,
then,
after
it
obtained
the
federal
license,
proceeded
to
build
the
pensacola
dam.
and
under
that
license,
they
agreed
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
government
in
regard
to
releases
from
the
dam
and
the
secretary
of
war
in
1941
established
a
regimen
of
how
the
releases
had
to
be
made
and
the
pensacola
dam
had
a
provision
in
it
for
aid
to
navigation,
flood
control
and
hydroelectric
development.
the
ft.
gibson
dam
that's
an
issue
here
also
had
exactly
the
three
--
same
three
elements.
the
court
of
claims
decided
as
one
of
its
findings,
finding
17,
that
this
dam
had
those
three
elements
and
did
affect
navigation.
so,
we
have
a
nonnavigable
stream.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
first
one
was
the
effect
--
a
substantial
effect
on
navigation
and
the
second
was
flood
control,
which
is
really
a
contributing
factor
and
the
other
is
a
hydroelectric
development.
so,
it
has
been
already
determined
in
this
--
in
regard
to
this
authority,
in
the
development
of
this
stream
that
they
could
not,
even
though
they
had
a
state
license
to
build
this
very
dam
at
pensacola.
it
was
impossible
under
the
law
for
them
to
build
it
except
that
they
got
first
a
federal
permit
from
the
united
states.
and
after
they
got
that,
and
in
the
permit,
there
was
a
condition
that
they
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
federal
government
about
the
releases.
and
then
the
secretary
of
war
made
regulations
as
to
just
how
these
releases
should
be
made
down
the
river.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
worthless
as
far
as
the
united
states
was
concerned.
the
united
states
didn't
need
any
part
of.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
none,
whatsoever,
mr.
justice.
because
they
had
to
get
a
federal
license
before
they
could
get
any
benefit
out
of
any
state
permit
whatsoever
and
we
didn't
have
to
have
one.
we
got
a
federal
court
order
authorizing
united
states
on
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
my
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
would
be
that
it
did
not.
because
i
would
think
anybody
who
would
come
forward
would
have
to
have
a
federal
license
and
if
they
had
a
federal
license
under
the
holdings
of
this
court,
they
wouldn't
have
to
get
a
state
license
to
make
that
federal
license
good.
i
think
the
iowa
case
and
oregon
power
decided
that
so
that
whenever
they
got
the
federal
license,
it
seemed
to
me
if
we
were
revising
plans,
we'd
say,
“go
get
your
federal
license.
if
you
have
it,
you
can
supersede
anything
else
and
your
state
license
would
be
meaningless
to
you.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
couldn't
conceive
that
were
done
to
your
holdings.
it
seems
to
me
it's
meaningless
if
you
assume
as
is
been
held
in
this
case
that
this
does
have
a
substantial
effect
upon
navigation.
therefore,
it's
within
the
control
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
licensing.
now,
with
that
kind
of
a
situation,
i
don't
mean
that
if
you
find
the
franchisers
worthless
that
there
couldn't
be
water
rights
which
were
but
compensable.
i
think
there
are
two
separate
propositions
i
wanted
to
deal
with
and
accordingly.
but
its
position
to
the
government
that
there
is
no
value
to
this
franchise
that
the
government
didn't
need
it,
the
federal
power
commission's
license
or
in
the
authority
of
the
congress,
there's
no
question
about
the
power
rule
of
the
congress.
oklahoma
against
atkinson
decides
all
of
that
in
regard
to
the
denison
dam.
the
congress
had
the
power
to
say
on
this
nonnavigable
river
if
it
substantially
affected
navigation,
then
that
dam
can
be
controlled
by
the
federal
power
commission.
the
power
is
there
and
this
--
there's
a
separate
question
about
the
compensation
factor.
now,
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
water
rights,
how
did
they
get
any
water
rights?
they
rely
upon
the
statute
which
authorizes
them
to
use
the
water
of
the
grand
river
in
general
terms.
we
--
the
government
thinks
that
is
an
authorization
for
them
to
use
water.
this
also
excludes
other
parties.
it's
a
state
statute,
excludes
other
parties.
now,
it's
clear
here
that
they
have
never
applied
this
water
to
beneficial
use,
which
is
element
number
one
in
regard
to
the
appropriative
rights.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
they
had
never
applied
water
at
this
place
and
that's
the
only
thing
that's
involved
here
because
they
tried
to
get
the
commission,
the
federal
power
commission
to
assess
damages
against
the
united
states
for
the
values
that
might
be
in
their
reservoir
at
the
pensacola.
and
the
federal
power
commission,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
weren't
entitled
to
such
damages
that
the
united
states
wouldn't
--
couldn't
have
been
required
to
pay
such
damages,
in
regard
to
their
pool
above
the
pensacola
dam.
so
then,
there's
the
question
of
what
kind
of
water
rights
they
get.
now,
remember
where
the
united
states
here
is
using
a
run
of
the
stream
in
this
use
of
this
water
on
this
dam.
the
water
is
held
back
not
over
24
hours
in
the
entire
time.
the
water
is
not
consumed
under
water
law.
there's
no
consumption
of
water.
it's
just
passing
it
through
the
penstocks
and
the
--
the
turbines
and
goes
right
on
down
the
stream
without
any
diminution
whatsoever.
now
the
only
water
--
we're
not
asking
to
make
a
change
of
one
drop
in
their
releases.
the
only
water
we're
going
to
use
and
are
using
--
because
this
is
an
operation
now.
at
the
ft.
gibson
dam
is
the
water
that
they
are
required
under
the
federal
law,
under
their
federal
license
and
under
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
war
to
deliver
down
that
stream.
we're
not
asking
to
release
one
additional
drop
of
water
beyond
what
they
have,
to
now,
locally
release.
and
they
claim
that
they've
got
some
kind
of
water
rights.
i
think
their
claim
is
appropriate
to
water
rights
in
that
--
that
water
that
goes
down
below
their
dam
and
we
have
to
pay
for
because
we
have
erected
a
federal
dam
at
the
ft.
gibson
site.
now,
that's
the
basic
issue
about
the
compensation
for
water
rights.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
they
could
not
have
such
water
rights
under
the
oklahoma
law.
oklahoma
law
is
complicated
about
water
rights.
it
has
apparently
--
the
best
we
can
determine
from
their
decisions
and
from
the
writers,
a
combination
somewhat
like
california
in
regard
to
riparian
and
appropriative
water
rights.
both
are
present
within
the
state
of
oklahoma.
there
aren't
any
riparian
lands
so
there
just
can't
be
riparian
rights
here.
there
was
no
claim
that
they've
ever
been,
had
and
separated
and
sold
off
like
international
power,
nothing
of
that
kind.
so,
the
only
thing
left
that
they've
got
is
that
they've
got
to
be
appropriative
rights.
now,
the
test
of
appropriative
rights
generally
in
all
western
water
is
that
it's
got
to
be
diverted
and
applied
to
beneficial
use.
and
until
that
time
it's
in
court.
it
isn't
a
vested
water
right
at
all.
now,
that
is
described
in
so
many
words
by
the
laws
of
oklahoma.
we
set
that
out
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
think
that
there
is
federal
law
about
how
they
could
get
a
water
right
away
from
the
united
states.
the
court
of
claims
just
said
that
oklahoma
own
all
the
water
in
the
streams
and
said
three
lines
to
support
that
in
--
and
one
oklahoma
case
and
--
and
i
guess
it
was
new
mexico
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
the
court
of
claims
was
right
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
i
think
that
the--
the
handling
of
water
rights
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
if
they
got
title
to
it
anytime,
would
be
in
accordance
with
their
laws.
but
i
think
you
can't
get
a
property
right
away
from
the
united
states
unless
you
can
show
that
you've
got
to
conveyance
or
a
transfer
or
some
kind.
now,
this
--
this
is
what's
called
an
incorporeal
hereditament,
as
you
well
know,
in
regard
to
a
water
right.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
character,
a
form
of
property.
it's
one
of
the
bundle
of
rights.
and
as
a
part
of
that,
it's
just
like
it
was
--
it
--
it
fits
right
into
our
real
property
law
and
the
whole
structure
and
therefore,
you
have
to
find
somebody
had
title
and
that
title
has
to
pass.
it
just
can't
hang
in
the
air.
so,
of
course,
the
united
states
had
title
to
all
of
that,
with
the
louisiana
purchase.
there's
no
question
about
that.
now,
in
some
place,
you
have
to
--
just
like
you
take
a
piece
of
black
paper,
you
have
to
trace
that
title
down
from
a
to
b
to
c
and
on
down
the
line
and
that's
the
problem
you
have
in
regard
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
this,
you
then
still
get
to
the
problem
of
the
navigation
servitude.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
don't
think
you
reach
that.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case
because
i
don't
think
they
have
anything
to
sell
so
that
you
get
--
have
to
get
to
that
question.
but
there
still
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
united
states
would
have
to
pay
for
that
if
under
the
navigation
servitude
because
if
--
and
that
involves
the
twin
city
question
of
whether
or
not
twin
city
applies
to
a
nonnavigable
river.
but
the
united
states
takes
the
position
that
there's
no
problem
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
you
still
have
to
apply
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
regard
to
how
they
got
the
water
away
from
united
states.
you
don't
allow
a
state
to
say
that
and
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
you
don't
allow
a
state
to
say,
“we
shall
take
the
federal
courthouse
away
from
the
federal
government.
now,
it's
ours.”
there's
nothing
like
that's
have
been
allowed
by
this
court.
you
--
you
apply
your
federal
statutes
to
see
whether
congress,
which
you
said
has
plenary
power
about
the
property
of
the
united
states,
has
ever
done
anything
about
that
property.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
congress
could
dispose
of
all
the
property
of
the
united
states
within
some
limits.
i
don't
want
to
say
that
it
could
just
not
carry
out
its
obligation
to
all
of
the
states.
so
that
--
but
generally,
you
said
that
they
have
plenary
power
in
that
area
and
certainly
within
what
they've
tried
to
do
and
you've
never
questioned
when
they
have
plainly
done
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
you've
--
this
court
very
definitely
has
not
decided
that
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
i
think.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
open
and
this
court
hasn't
decided
that
question
and
i
think
you've
made
that
claim
in
your
decisions
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
power
of
congress
to
control
the
--
a
stream
that
has
an
effect
or
substantial
effect
on
navigation
and
one
that's
--
is
navigable
and
the
navigation
servitude
that
there
is
a
separate
factor
in
regard
to
navigation
servitude
of
its
effect
upon
property
rights
in
connection
with
water.
but
i
think
in
this
case,
you
never
get
down
to
those
points
because
you
have
to
find
some
place,
first,
that
they
have
a
right
because
mere
prospects,
mere
frustration
of
business
opportunities,
all
those
things
you've
held
are
non-compensable.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
of
claims
held
that
they
--
that
this
was
different
than
twin
city
and
because
it
was
nonnavigable.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
that
they
had
property
rights
because
the
state
of
oklahoma
owned
all
the
water
in
the
nonnavigable
streams
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
oklahoma
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
(inaudible)
because
they
have
to
first
get
the
water
away
from
united
states
by
federal
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
anything.
the
whole
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
they
have
a
right.
they
--
they
can
get
rights
from
the
united
states
to
authorize
certain
action.
i
don't
think
they
can
get
title
away
from
united
states
unless
the
congress
provides
for
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
also
have
the
--
the
property
view
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
as
to
the
water
because
the
water
is
a
property
right
as
well
as
the
land.
now,
you
do
not
treat
in
your
decisions
the
fact
that
a
state
is
created
as
giving
the
state
all
the
property
within
that
state.
the
united
states
owes
--
owns
over
40%
of
the
land
of
this
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
concede
that
--
that
navigable
or
nonnavigable
doesn't
determine
the
title
to
the
water
as
such,
but
i
do
say
that
a
water
right
is
a
property
right
and
no
one
can
get
that
away
from
the
united
states.
it
might
get
the
right
to
use
it.
it
might
get
an
authorization
of
some
kind
by
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
saying
that
the
--
the
waters
and
all
lands
and
so
forth,
that
the
united
states
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
originally
owned.
it
continued
to
have
a
--
a
legal
property
interest
in.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
would
depend
upon
what
the
united
states
provided.
what
it
consented
to.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
let
me
say
it
first
that
there
was
a
conveyance
that
they
rely
upon
to
the
cherokee
nation.
that
conveyance
involved
whatever
riparian
rights
there
were
to
those
lands
because
there
was
no
reservation
in
connection
with
it.
that
they
also
--
there
were
certain
conveyances
out
from
that
in
allotments
which
you're
familiar
with
i'm
sure
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
which
the
--
i
don't
mean
the
detail,
but
that's
the
general
procedure
there
that
the
allottees
got
individual
holdings
from
time
to
time.
there
is
no
showing
of
any
kind
that
these
people
or
the
state
of
oklahoma
ever
got
any
title
from
any
of
those
people,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
as
far
as
they
have
shown.
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
about
whether
that
even
happened
that
far
because
of
the
reservations
about
disposal
of
such
property
as
--
by
the
indians
and
by
their
allottees,
the
restrictions
that
there
are
under
the
law
and
the
fact
that
they
have
to
be
consulted
in
--
in
regard
to
all
of
those
things.
now,
they
--
they
rely
on
to
section
25
statute
that's
set
out
in
the
appendix
and
that
is
a
provision
back
in
1906
that
authorized
private
or
public
utilities
to
acquire
such
land
and
water
rights
and
so
forth
for
a
dam
on
various
rivers
within
the
indian
territory.
and
if
they
had
proceeded
to
do
that
and
there
is
a
provision
there
for
condemnation
under
state
law
and
the
oklahoma
state
courts
have
held
that
that
has
to
be
brought
within
the
federal
courts.
they
could
then
have
obtained
a
right
in
regard
to
that
property
to
build
a
dam
and
get
the
water
rights
and
so
forth
away
from
the
indians,
if
they
couldn't
make
an
agreement
to
do
it.
that's
the
general
substance
to
that
statute.
neither
had
occurred.
they
haven't
got
any
deeds
from
these
people,
from
the
indians
having
kinds
of
restrictions
on
--
they're
getting
some
--
from
some
of
them.
now,
some
of
them
were
probably
emancipated.
i
--
we
haven't
got
into
that
in
the
case
but
i
--
that's
the
general
picture.
but
the
allottees
themselves
can't
dispose
of
their
property
without
numerous
restrictions
or
protection
by
the
united
states
through
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
and
the
nation
itself
cannot
dispose
of
the
property.
now,
it's
a
basic
principle
of
property
law
that
you
never
can
prove
your
title
by
showing
a
weakness
of
the
--
the
other
side.
you've
got
to
show
title
in
yourself
in
any
quiet
title
action.
the
mere
fact
that
they
say,
“we
deeded
away
the
property,
the
united
states
does.”
it
doesn't
approve
that
oklahoma
ever
got.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
doesn't
mean
that
we
have
the
title,
but
we
are
trying
to
quiet
on
this
title.
they
are
trying
to
get
the
money
from
us
for
a
title
we
say
they
don't
have.
and
it's
--
the
burdens
on
them
to
prove
that
they've
got
that
title,
as
a
basic
property
rule.
and
they
haven't
established
even
by
their
deed
theory.
any
chain
of
title
would
get
it
away.
now,
this
court
hasn't
ever
decided
the
question
of
who
owns
the
water
in
these
streams.
passed
it
out
in
nebraska
against
wyoming
and
in
ivanhoe
and
i
think
you
should
pass
it
up
this
time.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
get
to
it.
i
think
the
questions
are
much
simpler
than
that
and
that's
a
very
grave
question
between
the
united
states
and
the
states
and
i
wouldn't
ask
this
court
to
decide
that
question
until
it
became
crucial
to
the
interest
of
the
particular
litigation
and
something
of
major
importance
to
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
also
the
court
has
tried
to
address
itself
to
the
problems
of
the
use
of
this
water
and
that
the
country
should
have
the
use
of
it
and
not
be
quarreling
over
these
incidents
that
whether
it
should
be
a
system
that
made
it
possible
for
the
country
to
use
it.
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
it
in
this
case
at
all.
i
don't
think
there's
any
proof
in
this
case
that
they've
ever
had
a
title
to
any
water
rights.
we're
not
asking
anything
except
to
make
the
releases
that
they
have
to
make
under
their
federal
license.
there
are
no
riparian
lands
involved.
they
have
no
riparian
water
rights.
their
franchise
is
useless
to
the
united
states.
you
clearly
held
that
united
states
doesn't
have
to
get
a
franchise
from
a
state
in
order
to
build
this
dam.
there's
no
question
about
the
substantial
effect
on
navigation
and
that
this
--and
therefore,
seems
to
me
that
the
only
thing
that
you
could
possibly
have
is
this
prospective
interest
that
someone
might
want
to
pay
something
for
a
state
franchise
that
they
don't
need
--
that
we
get
a
federal
franchise,
that
this
very
authority
wasn't
and
wasn't
worth
anything
to
them
because
they
had
to
get
a
federal
franchise
to
build
the
pensacola.
now,
there's
one
case
by
this
court
i
want
to
call
attention
to.
that's
the
grand-hydro
case
in
335
u.s.
--
i
think
it's
359.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
did
hold
that
this
very
authority
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
to
pay
the
grand-hydro
for
a
state
license
on
this
particular
stream,
state
franchise.
and
it
held
that
because
in
that
action
they
brought
a
condemnation
proceeding,
as
a
state
licensee,
not
as
a
federal
licensee.
and
they
brought
it
claiming
under
the
state
condemnation
laws
and
not
federal
condemnation
laws.
and
this
court
in
explicit
terms,
on
page
373
toward
the
bottom
of
page
of
that
case
said
that
either
the
united
states
or
its
licensee
as
such
were
seeking
to
acquire
this
land
under
the
federal
power
act,
it
might
face
different
considerations
from
those
stated
above.
the
united
states
enjoys
special
rights
and
power
in
relation
to
navigable
streams
and
also
the
streams
which
affect
interstate
commerce.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
that
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
see
where
they
--
even
under
state
law
can
establish
that
they
ever
got
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
seems
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
me
the
state
laws
that
they're
relying,
their
authorization
and
to
take
water
from
the
stream
for
it
to
build
dams
and
the
section
25
that
i
referred
to
about
indian
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
tribes
are
all
general
authorizations.
but
the
basic
policy,
if
they're
going
to
claim
appropriative
rights
and
they
can't
have
any
riparian,
they
haven't
got
any.
any
riparian
lands
which
would
have
riparian
rights.
then
they've
got
to
rely
on
appropriative
--
and
on
appropriative,
they
have
not
established
that
they
ever
applied
it
to
beneficial
use
at
the
point
where
they've
got
to
--
to
charge
us
and
that's
at
this
dam.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
corps
of
engineers
did,
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
all
of
it.
they
own
70
acres
there
that
was
not
riparian.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
we
have
the
federal
license.
nobody
can
do
it
without
the
federal
license.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
the
purpose.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
justice,
i
don't
want
to
claim
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
that
we've
compensated
for
this
because
we
expressly
said
that's
not
compensable
and
if
--
if
they
settled
on
that
basis,
they've
misunderstood
because
they
didn't
mean
to.
they
didn't
get
anything
that
we
never
intend
to
pay
them
anything,
for
the
franchise
over
the
water
rights
in
regard
to
their
70
acres.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
for
any
other
use,
except
they
couldn't
have
any
value
for
the
franchise
because
it
was
worthless
and
they
couldn't
have
anything
for
the
appropriative
water
rights
because
they
didn't
have
any
and
it
didn't
have
any
relation
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
it's
--
but
on
the
water
rights,
i
think
that
has
no
effect
on
the
best
use
of
the
land
itself.
anyone
would
have
to
--
as
i
understand
the
law
in
oklahoma,
would
have
to
get
that
right
or
they
would
have
to
get
it
from
the
united
states
of
its
licensee
if
it
had
any
reserved
lands
or
all
the
other
things
that
are
involved
with
the
federal
power
act.
so
that's
separate
and
apart
from
the
highest
and
best
use
of
the
land.
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
franchise
value
is
a
factor
that
they
claim
that
they
should
be
compensated
for.
now,
they
didn't
have
the
dam
site
itself.
so
that
they
can't
say,
“well,
we
had
all
these
property
like
in
twin
city,”
which
was
a
riparian
land
and
nail
down
the
dam
site
itself.
but
they
did
have
something
that
we
needed,
70
acres
at
least,
in
order
to
develop
it
as
the
dam
site
although
they
didn't
have
the
dam
site
itself.
and
they
claimed
that
they
had
the
franchise
in
addition
to
whatever
value
there
was
for
that
land.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
separate
property.
and
we
say
the
united
states
has
the
right
under
federal
power
act
and
--
and
the
power
of
congress
since
this
substantially
affects
commerce,
to
say
the
united
states
can
build
this
dam.
it
doesn't
have
to
ask
anybody
and
the
state
franchise
has
no
value
and
it
would
merely
be
permitting
the
state
or
this
party
or
the
--
the
two
in
combination
to
impose
a
--
an
additional
cost
upon
the
united
states
to
develop
this
partially
for
--
in
assistance
or
aid
to
navigation,
partially
for
flood
control,
which
is
also
aid
to
navigation,
and
also
for
hydroelectric.
and
that
the
united
states,
under
your
holdings,
has
not
been
required
to
pay
for
any
such
property.
and
they
don't
have
the
appropriative
rights.
they
don't
have
any
water
rights
of
any
kind.
this
is
a
run
of
a
stream
dam.
all
they
have
to
do
is
comply
with
their
federal
license
in
the
federal
laws,
in
the
federal
regulations
to
the
secretary
of
war
and
that's
all
the
water
we
use,
just
after
they
release
it.
it's
served
their
full
purpose
and
that
there's
no
compensable
rights
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
assume,
although
i'm
not
very
well
informed
as
technician
on
this
but
within
eight
miles
of
the
confluence
of
the
river
that
there's
so
much
effect
on
--
that
there
couldn't
be
any
question.
all
of
--
all
three
dams
were
found
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
have
and
has
the
substantial
effect.that's
the
test
on
the
federal
power
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
are
substantial
reservations
in
it
for
flood
control.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
28
feet
of
--
of
this
reservoir
that's
for
that
specific
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
all
of
those
rivers
are
at
certain
times
of
the
year
as
you
know
that
they
get
very
low
in
fact
even
ohio
was
low
enough
to
have
special
provision
to
get
some
water
down
there
at
one
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
isn't
contested
here
and
it's
determined.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it's
rather
uniform
approach
of
the
corps
of
engineers
that
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
effect
on
navigation
and
then
flood
control
and
--
and
hydroelectric.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
is
not
like
that
at
all.
i
think,
mr.
justice,
you
described
exactly
what
this
is.
this
was
the
prospect
or
the
opportunity.
it's
--
involved
in
the
powelson
case
and
the
omnia
case.
the
monongahela
case
is
not
like
this
case.
monongahela
case,
the
government
moved
in
and
took
the
locks
and
other
property
which
was
in
operation
at
that
time
and
proceeded
to
operate
that
very
property.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
exactly
and
that's
the
difference.
here
was
an
opportunity
that
they
hoped
to
enjoy
in
the
future
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
united
states
has
to
pay
under
the
fifth
amendment
for
that
kind
of
a
frustration
of
opportunity.
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
except
that
i
think
this
is
even
more
than
that
because
this
is
a
frustration
of
an
opportunity
rather
than
something
that
is
destroyed.
if
--
it's
even
more
remote.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
facility?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
had
no
facility.
they
had
no
dam.
they
had
no
dam
site.
they
had
nothing,
except
plans.
i
don't
think
we
have
any
difference
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
have
hoped
to
have
a
dam
here
and
the
facility
that
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know,
but
i
would
assume
what
mr.
larson
said
in
that
regard.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
have
assumed
that
what
he
said.
i'm
not
--
i
know
we
acquired
and
paid
for
the
transmission
lines
that
they
had
built
to
possibly
that
site.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
--
i
think
that's
all
resolved
in
the
denial
of
their
claim
with
the
federal
power
commission,
but
you
--
the
further
fact
that
you
should
know
that
it's
in
our
brief
is
that
the
markham
ferry
dam
was
allotted
by
the
federal
power
commission
to
the
government
to
build
and
then
congress
decided
to
have
the
authority
build
it.
so,
congress
has
resolved
the
question,
the
political
question
there
about
who
should
build
the
ft.gibson
by
not
interfering
with
the
federal
power
commission's
action
there,
but
interfering
on
the
markham
ferry.
now,
they
have
also
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there's
a
$6,500,000,
we'd
say
it
tell
about
in
the
footnote
that
congress
has
voted
as
an
appropriation
for
them
with
the
release
connected
to
it.
they
haven't
taken
it
yet.
so,
the
government
doesn't
say
that
it
binds.
but
they
have
that
provision
that
apparently
congress
has
worked
out
as
some
kind
of
a
settlement.
now,
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
apparently.
now,
it
--
i
want
to
clear
here
too
that
the
government
has
not
overreached
anybody
in
this
transaction.
the
pensacola
dam
cost
something
like
$20,000,000.
$8,500,000
of
it
was
an
outright
grant
to
the
authority
from
the
united
states
government.
and
as
a
part
of
wpa,
$12,000,000
was
a
loan
from
the
government.
so,
that
much
has
all
come
out
of
uncle
sam
and
now
we're
--
the
congress
has
voted
$6,500,000
additional
to
try
to
make
up
to
the
many
difficulties
they
have.
now
(inaudible)
that
congress
examined.
they've
--
it
required
because
of
the
building
of
this
dam,
the
way
it
was,
that
they
put
their
waterline
differently
than
they'd
it
before
and
they
gave
them
the
money
to
take
care
of
that.
so,
the
congress
has
tried
to
take
care
of
these
various
problems
and
resolve
them
in
a
political
area.
now,
on
regard
to
the
indian
deeds,
i
don't
see
yet
how
they
ever
get
the
title
to
this
water
that
they
say
the
water
right
is
in
the
allottees
and
the
indian
nation
over
to
anybody
else.
for
example,
in
my
state
of
nebraska,
there
are
all
kinds
of
indian
lands.
i
don't
know
of
any
power
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
nebraska
when
it
became
a
state,
changed
from
a
territory
into
a
state
to
automatically
take
those
indian
lands
and
make
them
belong
to
the
--
the
state
of
nebraska.
there
isn't
any
such
power
that's
ever
been
recognized.
now,
as
far
as
equal
footing
is
concerned,
all
through
the
eastern
state
this
court
has
held
up
time
--
held
time
after
time
that
people
continued
to
have
their
riparian
rights,
and
no
state
that
i
know
of,
has
claimed
under
the
right
of
equal
footing
or
any
other
constitutional
power,
the
right
to
take
the
riparian
rights
of
people
that
have
had
them
even
before
the
country
was
established,
away
from
them,
just
because
they
were
created
a
state.
they've
recognized
that
under
the
common
law
those
riparian
rights
were
there.
they
were
a
property
right
and
they
continue
to
enjoy
them
over
the
years.
and
how
or
any
other
state
could
--
it's
got
to
have
some
right
far
greater
and
different
than
the
equal
footing
or
treating
like
the
other
eastern
state,
the
13
states
of
the
union
in
order
to
make
any
such
claim
as
that.
now,
the
position
of
the
government
that
if
the
title
was
in
the
united
states,
then
they
can't
get
it
away
from
them
just
by
some
declaration
of
a
state.
and
they
can't
get
it
away
from
the
indians
or
the
wards
of
the
united
states.
and
they
cannot
get
it
away
from
anybody
else.
now,
there
is
this
problem
about
this
matter
and
i
want
the
court
to
understand
about
the
riparian
and
appropriative
rights.
the
riparian
rights
are
the
right
to
enjoy
the
flow
of
the
river
constantly
coming
down
and
if
you
want
to
divert
that
water,
you've
got
to
return
it
to
the
stream
in
substantially
the
same
way
less
your
reasonable
use.
and
if
you
don't
use
it
as
a
riparian,
you've
got
to
continue
to
let
it
go
down
to
the
next
(inaudible)
until
such
time
as
you're
ready
to
use
it.
in
the
meantime,
there
are
all
kinds
of
appropriative
rights
that
are
unappropriated
yet
because
nobody
has
moved
up
to
use
them
in
that
water
that
are
available.
and
california
is
an
ideal
state.
there
are
numbers
of
cases
there
in
which
they
have
recognized
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
water
right.
the
riparians
can
have
rights
on
that
same
stream.
if
they
don't
exercise
them,
they're
unappropriated
water
rights
there
that
other
people
can
file
for
according
to
state
law
and
under
the
desert
land
act
and
acquire
those
rights
and
have
vested
rights
and
there's
no
question
about
it.
so
that
both
of
them
can
live
together,
but
there's
none
of
that
in
this
case.
there's
no
provision.
now,
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
here
is
basic
to
this
case.
it's
whether
or
not,
in
every
case
where
the
united
states
wants
to
exercise
the
power
that
it
has
under
the
commerce
clause,
to
provide
through
the
federal
power
commission
for
the
construction
of
a
dam
on
a
nonnavigable
river
because
it
substantially
affects
commerce.
that
they
have
to
pay
a
tribute,
because
someone
has
stepped
up
and
gotten
a
license
to
build
that
dam
and
done
nothing
more,
got
a
license
and
a
statute
passed
through
the
legislature
to
get
some
water
rights
and
done
nothing
more
in
regard
to
it
except
that.
then
do
you
have
to
--
does
the
united
states
have
to
add
that
kind
of
value
in
order
to
get
this
facility
built
in
the
interest
of
the
country?
and
i'd
say
it
never
should
that
there's
no
reason
why
that
kind
of
value
should
be
recognized
under
the
fifth
amendment.
