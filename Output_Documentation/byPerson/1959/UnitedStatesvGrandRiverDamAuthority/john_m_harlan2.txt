justice
john
m.
harlan
if
--
if
under
oklahoma
law,
there
was
title
in
the
authority
of
this
water,
what
would
be
the
position
of
the
united
states
then,
as
to
its
compensability?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
was
going
to
say
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
i
was
raising
of
course,
is
the
question
of
the
status
of
these
alleged
water
rights
under
state
law,
a
determinative
question
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
claims
held
that
they
did
have.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
had
the
property
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
mind
straightening
me
out,
why
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
property
interest,
the
alleged
property
interest
to
--
the
authority
in
these
waters?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we'd
mean
because
as
a
matter
so
clear
that
they
haven't
got
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
all
right.
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
were
(inaudible).
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
sure?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
the
court
of
claims
on
that
possibly
the
case
was
demonstrably
in
error.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
the
exclusion
of
the
united
states?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
any
appropriation
resulted
from
the
creation
of
the
dam
authority
would
be
subject
to
that,
those
paramount
rights
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
each
of
the
states,
whatever
they
were.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
all
that's
true,
what
has
the
united
states
done
by
way
of
taking
the
use
of
that
water
and
that
it
is
compensable,
just
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
water
rights
as
distinguished
from
franchise
rights.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
--
that's
his
franchise
isn't
it,
not
the
use
of
the
waters?
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
united
states
is
not
impaired
by
any
--
to
any
degree
the
amount
of
water
that
whatever
the
dam
authority's
rights
are
they're
still
available
to
the
dam
without
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
--
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled
that
--
are
you
saying
that
if
there
had
been
no
conveyance
by
the
united
states
to
the
cherokee
nation
that
in
--
so
that
the
title
prior
to
the
statehood,
these
waters
remained
in
the
united
states.
are
you
saying
that
in
consequence
of
admission
the
equal
footing
clause
divested
the
united
states
of
whatever
it
had?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
riparian
rights
are
rights
--
ownership
rights.
justice
john
m.
harlan
take
the
voice
of
the
united
states.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
were
before
they've
been
conveyed
to
the
indians
and
before
the
statehood
certainly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
is
prompted
by
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan
that
your
equal
footing
argument
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
made
the
conveyance
to
the
indians
an
irrelevant
in
the
circumstance.
