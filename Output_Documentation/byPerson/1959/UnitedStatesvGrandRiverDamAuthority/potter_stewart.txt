what's
the
difference
between
those
two,
the
franchise
to
build
a
dam
and
--
and
the
water
rights
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
vested
in
this
state
commission?
justice
potter
stewart
quite
apart
from
the
franchise?
justice
potter
stewart
well
who
--
it's
for
that
reason
that
i
asked
this
question
i
can
see
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
what
is
the
substantial
effect
upon
navigation
that
was
found
as
distinguished
from
flood
control?
justice
potter
stewart
to
have
an
effect.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
dam
actually
is
using
the
hydroelectric
purposes
for
generating
electricity?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
for
flood
control.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
of
course,
flood
control
in
and
out
itself
would
have
an
effect
on
navigation
by
what
--
but
that
the
court
of
claims
put
them
on
the
three
categories
and
i
wondered
what
affect
on
navigation
there
would
be
outside
of
the
flood
control?
justice
potter
stewart
--
flood
control
i
suppose
maybe
is
the
channel
in
the
arkansas
river's
problem?
does
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
this
is
an
uncontested
finding
isn't
--
but
it
has
a
substantial
effect
on
the
fact
that
it
does
have.
this
dam
does
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
that,
where
is
the
power
now
being
generated
by
the
federal
installation?
where
is
that
power
going?
and
who
is
it
being
sold
to?
justice
potter
stewart
is
not
a
cooperative
hooked
up
between
the
--
your
two
existing
dams
and
--
and
this
ft.
gibson
dam?
justice
potter
stewart
one
other
thing,
it
occurs
to
me,
you've
just
told
us
now
that
this
power
can
only
be
sold
at
costs
that
there
cannot
be
a
profit
realized
by
the
state
under
the
terms
of
the
--?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
then
why
does
the
loss
of
the
opportunity
to
generate
that
power
result
to
any
damage
to
the
authority?
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
this
just
for
information
they
--
that
the
conveyance
from
the
cherokee
nation
to
the
individual
nation,
to
the
individual
indians
was
conveyed,
what
kind
of
an
estate
to
these
individuals?
justice
potter
stewart
to
individual
estates
or
to
them
and
as
tenants
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
not
individually
as
by
name
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
particular
tracts
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
particular
indians,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
particular
tracts
to
particular
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
indian.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
would
--
you
would
--
your
position
as
that
those
indians
or
their
successor
is
entitle
still
would
have
riparian
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
and
that
of
course
is
open
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
it
true
that
these
three
dams
were
all
under
the
basic
master
plan
to
be
part
of
a
--
a
coordinated
complex
for
the
generation
of
electricity
and
flood
control
and
navigation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
possibly
the
three
together
were
taking
away
--
taking
--
possibly
taking
away
one
dam
would
do
more
damage
to
the
whole
than
just
the
--
that
particular
--
that
portion
or
the
part?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
all
like
damage
to
the
residue
idea.
