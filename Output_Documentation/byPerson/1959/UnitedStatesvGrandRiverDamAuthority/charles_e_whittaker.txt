whittaker
franchise
and
waterways.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
may
i
ask
you,
that
land
taken
by
condemnations
of
fast
lands?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
were
those
(inaudible)
with
the
property
(inaudible)
fast
lands
on
using
property?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
the
tax
of
court
of
government
or
purchase
(inaudible)
isn't
not
just
condemnation
or
purchase
has
with
it
all
elements
of
the
property
involved
including
the
highest
and
best
use
of
the
fast
lands
which
includes
the
right
to
build
and
operate
a
dam
with
these
rights,
and
if
(inaudible)
they
have
that
compensation
to
(inaudible)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
water
at
this
place?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
congress
could.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
what
the
united
states
owned
at
one
time
and
has
not
conveyed
it
still
owned.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
so
the
mere
admission
of
oklahoma
as
a
state
did
not
divest
the
united
states
of
titles
it
then
owned.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
did
not
the
deed
of
the
united
states
to
the
cherokee
nation
in
1838
convey
this
particular
property
to
the
cherokee
nation
and
then
by
mean
conveyance
to
oklahoma.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
well,
i
wouldn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
the
united
states
passed
it
to
the
cherokee
nation,
but
the
cherokee
nation
conveyed
it
to
oklahoma.
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
fact
that
--
that
the
other
form
of
title
may
not
be
good
doesn't
mean
you
have
them.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
would
you
clear
me
up
on
with
this
page
please?
you
can't
build
a
dam
at
just
any
place
on
the
grand
river.
you
have
to
pick
a
dam
site,
do
you
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now,
they
pick
three
here.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now,
did
they
at
one
time
own
a
dam
site
at
ft.
gibson?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
could
you
both
build,
after
you
built
your
dam,
nor
could
they
still
build
their
dam?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you've
appropriated
that's
fact.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes
and
you've
acquired
their
land,
at
least
70
acres
of
it,
that
was
incident
to
that
purpose
back
on
the
motion
proceeding.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now,
the
value
of
that
land
as
i
would
suppose,
you
tell
me
whether
this
is
right
or
wrong.
that
it'll
be
measured
by
at
least
--
considered
in
connection
with
its
highest
and
best
use,
isn't
it?
and
wouldn't
that
be
in
connection
with
its
possibilities
as
a
dam
site
and
under
its
license?
and
when
you
--
you
have
paid
the
value,
thus
inherent
in
that
land,
have
the
full
compensations
been
made?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
the
payment
for
the
70
acres,
just
watched
and
viewed
this
farming
land?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
value
was
determined
on
that
basis?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
it's
a
separate
element
piece
of
property?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
citizens
of
oklahoma.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
based
upon
this
--
that
argument
it
is
your
announcement
that
it
was
the
conveyance
by
the
united
states
to
the
cherokees
that
passed
the
government's
title.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
that's
not
immaterial
than
not
conveyance,
is
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
allottees.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
--
excuse
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
--
mr.
carter
may
i
--
would
you
please
answer
this
question
for
me.
could
you
at
ft.
gibson
use
either
the
waters
of
the
grand
river
or
the
franchise
from
the
state
of
oklahoma
without
ownership
of
the
ft.
gibson
dam
site?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
had
one.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
another
there
or
--
or
did
the
government
take
the
only
one?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
the
one
the
government
took?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
had
some
interest
in
the
70
acres
of
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
got
paid
for
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
it
hasn't
been?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
really?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
amount
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
being
taken
in
the
condemnation
proceeding?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
was
there?
you
did
have
some
interest
in
ft.
gibson
dam
site.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
how
--
why
--
why
don't
you
have
it
now?
why
don't
you
have
the
ft.
gibson
dam
site
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
did
not
have
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
any
dam
site
at
ft.
gibson?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
the
government
acquired
it,
some
third
parties,
is
that
right
and
not
from
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right,
that's
close
enough
for
me.
you
made
your
point.
