justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
you
really
mean
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
larson
may
i
--
mr.
larson,
i've
--
i
feel
like
to
catch
the
significance
of
your
equal
footing
argument.
you
start
with
the
basic
proposition,
as
i
heard
you,
that
the
united
states
divested
itself
of
all
interest
by
transfer
to
the
cherokee
nation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
then,
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
how
then
the
equal
footing
argument
becomes
heard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
these
alternatives
or
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
theretofore,
resting
in
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
theretofore
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
theretofore
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you
have
said
this
if
there
had
not
been
a
conveyance
by
the
united
states
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
cherokee
nation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
has
the
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
so
that
exactly,
the
transfer
of
the
cherokee
nation's
unimportant
to
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
you're
not
saying,
however,
that
that's
essential
to
your
equal
footing
argument,
without
regard
to
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
transfer
of
the
cherokee
nation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
they
actually
have
any
process,
mr.
solicitor,
the
procedures
for
acquiring
the
lands
upon
which
the
dam
would
be
built
when
you
moved
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
what
i
understood
this
is
what
in
the
fact
that
they'd
moved
the
transmission
lines
as
i
understood
it,
the
right
of
way
down
to
the
place
where
the
dam
was
to
be
constructed
and
were
in
the
process
of
about
to
acquire
the
lands
when
you
stepped
in
