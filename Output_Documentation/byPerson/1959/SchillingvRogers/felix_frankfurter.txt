justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
courts
--
this
court
ultimately
must
de
novo
determine
whether
a
particular
person
is
a
member
of
a
political,
racial
or
religious
group?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
does
that
mean
that
we
must
merely
review
whether
there's
a
ground
for
it,
that
the
attorney
general
has
so
concluding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
what
you
think
is
on
your
premise
that
it
is
reviewable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

much
of
our
review
that
this
court
must
decide
whether
a
particular
person
was
a
member
of
a
political
group
or
that
it
merely
reviews
whether
there
was
basis
for
the
attorney
general's
so
finding,
which
is
it?
they
are
very
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
all
of
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
standards
laid
down
are
political,
racial
or
religious.
and
my
question
is
whether
when
the
attorney
general
who's
the
ultimate
person
who
decides
and
says
take
this
case,
if
he's
not
a
member
of
political
group
--
that
--
that
whatever
that
may
mean,
he
doesn't
come
within
that
definition.
he's
not
included
in
that
circle.
is
the
district
court,
to
hear
new
evidence,
review
it
as
he
would
a
--
a
litigation
that
begins
with
him
without
any
prior
administrative
finding
or
is
he
merely
to
say,
“yes,
this
is
a
disputed
question
and
i
think
the
attorney
general
was
justified
in
making
such
a
conclusion.”
which
is
it?
they
are
very
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
specifically
in
this
case,
you
say
everybody
wasn't
a
member
of
the
nazi
party,
belonged
to
a
political
group,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
every
member
who
wasn't
allowed
to
practice
law
or
wasn't
allowed
to
do
this,
or
wasn't
allowed
to
do
that
belongs
to
a
political,
racial,
or
a
religious
group.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least,
you
must
stand
as
a
citizen
discriminating
against
political,
racial,
or
religious
groups.
he
must
be
a
member
of
one
those
three
groups,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
statute
does
say
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wasn't
allowed
to
practice
law
to
--
to
carry
out
what
he
would've
been
carried
out
that
(inaudible)
eventually
become
a
judge.
the
way
they
do
in
germany,
a
man
--
a
lawyer
says,
“i
decide
to
practice
my
profession
as
a
judge.”
and
he
was
denied
that
right
as
a
--
because
he
didn't
join
the
nazi
party.
now,
what
i'm
asking
you,
is
that
a
political,
racial,
or
religious
group,
so
that
there's
a
question
about
it
and
if
the
attorney
general
decided
against
it,
that's
reviewable
by
the
district
court
and
eventually,
by
us,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
an
allegation
of
fact,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
are
a
lot
of
those
and
in
germany
at
that
time,
weren't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
take
judicial
notice,
but
there
were
millions
whom
you've
described
by
that
allegation,
because
there
millions
who
were
not
members
of
the
nazi
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
then
you
make
a
separate
rule.
and
it's
the
denial
of
the
practice
of
law
of
all
those
who
were
denied
the
practice
of
law
and
that's
your
professorship,
did
they
constitute
a
political,
racial,
or
religious
group.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
you
think
that's
a
political
group.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
can
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.but
the
director
of
alien
property
had
abused
his
--
his
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
two
or
three
questions
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
we
have
held
the
immediate
question
is
32
(d).
after
all,
(d)
is
a
part
of
a
single
statute
and
i
cannot,
for
myself,
dissociate
consideration
of
your
--
of
your
immediate
questions,
with
paragraph
or
whatever
it
is,
paragraphs
(5),
“that
such
return
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.”
i,
myself,
must
decide
whether
if
this
case
goes
back
and
the
district
court
holds
for
you
and
then
it
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
attorney
general
and
he
would
have
to
decide
whether
the
return
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
if
by
a
singe
word,
“no,”
william
p.
rogers,
attorney
general,
that
concludes
the
litigation
because
that
--
if
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes
that
his,
no,
is
final
and
not
reviewable,
that
has
a
good
deal
of
bearing
in
my
mind
regarding
the
judicial
reviewability
of
(d),
because
i
wouldn't
suppose
that
congress
meant
to
say
that
you
could
go
in
and
have
litigation.
to
have
a
contest,
way
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
back
and
decide,
“yes,
he
comes
within
(d),”
but
the
attorney
general
by
his
(inaudible)
can
say,
“you
can't
have
it,
because
it's
not
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.”
so
i
don't
think
one
can
say,
“we're
not
qualified
to
decide
that
now.”
as
a
matter
of
construction,
i
feel
i
do
have
to
consider
whether
his
word
is
final
and
definitive,
because
if
it
is,
it
bears
on
what
(d)
does
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
know
that's
entirely
within
his
say-so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
bound
by
what
they
tell
him?
he
either
has
power
or
he
hasn't
any
power.
the
burden
of
the
united
states,
i
assume,
can
overrule
him
and
he
--
he
certainly
can't
sit
in
judgment
on
his
discretionary
power.
if
the
attorney
general
can
definitively
determine
after
consulting
or
not
consulting
that
it's
the
interest
of
the
united
states
not
to
return,
then
for
me,
it
has
a
great
deal
of
bearing
whether
they
have
judicial
review
of
these.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
doesn't
have
to
say
a
thing,
if
he
has
a
final
say.
so,
i'm
assuming
the
attorney
general
is
a
conscientious
officer.
he
is
the
official
leader
of
the
american
bar.
he
is
the
--
he
is
the
president's
advisor,
but
if
as
a
matter
of
law,
his
decision
is
not
reviewable
by
the
courts,
then
it's
not
reviewable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
he's
entitled
to
an
answer,
if
i
may
go
back
to
my
question,
he
has
got
an
answer.
and
the
director
said
that
as
he
construed
(d),
he
was
not
as
he'd
benefited
in
discriminating
against
political,
racial,
or
religious
groups
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
walter
schilling
or
has
not
--
did
not
come
within
the
designation
of
characterization
or
call
it
what
you
will,
of
a
political,
racial,
or
religious
group.
now,
it
--
it
certainly
seems
to
me
almost
incredible
to
say
that
that
is
not
a
justifiable
--
that
that
is
so
irrational,
that
it
came
from
a
mind
that
was
animated
by
sheer
hostility
against
schilling.
and
you
don't
say
that
he
was
arbitrary
or
abused
his
power
by
having
some
private
score
against
schilling
or
that
he
had
a
lawsuit
against
him
before
the
war
broke
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
that
he
--
that
he
married
his
sister
and
--
who
gave
him
a
hard
time
and
he
divorced
her.
you
don't
say
--
you
don't
appeal
that
kind
of
abuse
(voice

--
justice
felix

but
he
doesn't
have
--
you
don't
have
to
--
we
constantly
decide
legal
questions
without
evidence
--
justice
felix

we
assert
is
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
not
within
it
because
there's
a
special
provision
as
you,
yourself,
appealed
to.
trading

the
--
trading

the

its
own

justice

(voice

but
you
--
you
draw
it
out
of
it.
you
say
that

you
say
by
general
principles
of
law,
you've
just
told
us
a
little
while
ago.

subject
to
the
exceptions
of
the
administrative

act

it
makes
several
exceptions

from
my
point
of
view,
bar

justice

not
by

not
by
your
general
proposition,
but
by
your
appeal
to
that
act.
justice

lawyers
would
seem
always
to
get
more
comfort
out
of
my
dissenting
opinion
than
i
do
myself.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
didn't
take
that
line
of
argument.
what
good
is
it
--
except
you
may
have
great
intellectual
satisfaction
that
you
and
i
see
alike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
mandamus
anything
you
say.
you
could
mandamus
and
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
argue
the
matter
at
length
in
any
of
the
prior
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
zenith
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
second
world
war
legislation
dealing
with
enemy
aliens
mitigated
some
of
the
provisions
not
existing
but
mitigated
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
alien
enemy
act
of
the
(inaudible)
justice

frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
a
treaty
for
instance,
the
treaty
claimed
requested
property
as
requested
under
a
vesting
order
was
going
to
court
that
he
also
could
go
and
appeal
to
the
administrator
on
reviewable
action
of
the
attorney
general.
justice

that
a
german
or
if
an
enemy
alien
only
relief
was
under
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
old
case
would
allow
him
to
assure
his
american
citizenship
under
the
doctrine
of
refuge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
denying,
are
you
--
you're
not
denying,
are
you,
that
the
subject
matter
of
this
controversy
namely
whether
this
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
group
characterized
by
32
is
something
that
the
court
could
decide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
sense,
it's
a
justiciable
thing
but
some
other
things
are
not
justiciable
may
not
fit
for
judicial
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
was
withheld.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
--
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
are
you
suggesting
or
is
the
government
taking
the
position
that
if
the
director
says
suppose
the
decision
goes
for
the
government
that
this
is
the
law
and
if
we
could
not
have
affirmed
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
on
the
record
of
this
case,
is
it
your
position,
speaking
for
the
government
that
next
week
the
director
can
say
the
supreme
court
said
that
32
(d)
is
not
reviewable
--
the
determinations
under
that
are
not
judicially
reviewable,
therefore
i
don't
care
what
the
new
--
mr.
x
said.
i
don't
take
whether
he
is
or
isn't
within
the
category
of
the
statute,
this
is
not
reviewable.
i
decide
against
it.
are
you
saying
that
the
decision
is
saying
there's
no
judicial
review
in
this
case
would
cover
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
necessary,
that's
the
case
of
refusing
to
discharge
his
discretionary
duties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
are
plenty
of
cases
usually
the
covered
cases
particularly
or
non-reviewable
action
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
doesn't
allow
it
to
refuse
to
exercise
discretion
and
it
can
be
mandamus
and
an
official
may
have
a
non-reviewable
exercise
the
power
of
discretion
but
he
hasn't
that
a
non-reviewable
refusal
to
exercise
the
power
of
discretion
which
is
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
chief
justice's
case
isn't
a
mistake.
it's
a
willful
refusal
to
apply
the
statute
wherein
the
director
as
i
understand
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
case,
the
director
says,
“yes
this
man
is
within
the
statute
but
i
willfully
refuse
to
apply
the
statute.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
bad
faith,
he
may
think
he
may
have
a
private
policy
that
none
of
us
could
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
entitled
to
exercise
that
in
that
--
is
that
exercise
of
discretion?
to
me
that
is
an
extreme
case.
it's
a
different
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
says
he
shall
determine
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
presupposes
that
he
shall
determine
in
accordance
with
the
act,
i'm
coming
back
to
the
right
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
can
find
that
a
person
within
the
category
to
which
a
return
must
be
made,
but
he
refuses
to
do
it
he's
not
determining
then
in
any
fair
sense
of
the
term
determine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
if
--
if
a
position
is
made
before
the
director
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
it
is
concededly
take
--
take
your
own
position,
that
means
this
is
the
occupied
territory,
this
is
--
this
is
belgium
or
holland
during
occupation
and
he
sets
forth
all
the
facts
and
he
says
clearly
being
for
all
of
your
political
group
outlawed
by
german
laws,
nevertheless
i
decide
against
it.
i'm
not
--
not
talking
about
the
attorney
general,
that's
something
else
here,
nevertheless
he
decides
against
him,
so
you
think
that's
complying
what
he
shall
determine?
do
you
think
that's
a
determination
in
any
fair
reading
of
a
statute
charging
an
official
with
determining
something
and
the
criteria
you've
given
and
he
says
the
criteria
is
satisfied
but
i
nevertheless
reject
it.
do
you
think
that's
determining?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
bad
for
it
because
that
carries
other
connotations.
he
may
have
better
reach.
to
me
he
isn't
discharging
his
duty,
concededly
not
and
he
may
be
the
most
high-handed
man
in
the
world,
but
have
the
wrong
policy
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
you're
right.
that
is
what
i
think
of
standard
discriminated
against
that
he
must
be
a
member
of
--
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
subject
to
discriminating
against
political,
racial,
religious
groups,
he
must
come
within
those
--
one
of
those
three
groups
and
nothing
is
more
difficult
for
admiring
the
technology
that
goes
with
the
german
situation
and
to
determine
that
fact.
that's
another
reason
why
it
should
be
left
to
the
administrator
and
not
to
the
courts
because
it's
very
difficult
to
ascertain
whether
you
do
or
do
not
come
within
one
of
these
outlawed
groups.
that's
not
an
easy
thing
to
determine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
wouldn't
be
the
ultimate
determinant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
custodian?
he's
the
director
of
the
--
wasn't
he?
he
can
deal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
the
attorney
general
within
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
court
has
said
it
makes
a
difference
that
delegation
was
given
to
cabinet
officers
rather
than
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
attorney
general
--
has
the
attorney
general,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
(inaudible)
in
the
interest
of
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
has
the
written
opinion
on
that
or
just
denied
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
just
denied
--
he
just
denied
it.
