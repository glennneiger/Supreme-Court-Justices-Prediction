mr.
henry
i.
fillman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
for
consideration
by
the
court
is
whether
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
bill
of
complaint
which
seeks
to
review
a
determination
made
by
the
alien
property
custodian
and
the
attorney
general
as
to
the
ineligibility
of
the
petitioner
to
be
considered
for
return,
a
vested
property
under
section
32
(a)
(2)
(d)
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
this
is
not
a
suit
to
return
or
recover
vested
property.
the
complaint
merely
seeks
a
review
of
a
preliminary
issue
under
section
32
(a)
(2)
(d),
namely
whether
the
petitioner
comes
within
that
class
of
persons
specified
by
congress
in
the
first
proviso
of
that
section
as
eligible
to
be
considered
for
return
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
it
is
not,
your
honor.
i
--
reads
the
first
proviso
of
section
32
(a)
(2)
(d)
as
one
which
lays
down
standards
or
a
condition
of
status,
which
if
occupied
by
the
petitioner,
entitles
him
to
a
determination
of
eligibility.
it
reads
as
follows,
if
i
may,
“it
says
that
the
president
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
44
of
the
appendix
in
my
brief,
your
honor
please.
section
32,
return
of
property,
provides
that
the
president
or
such
officer
or
agency
as
he
may
designate,
in
this
case,
the
director
of
alien
property,
may
return.
it
doesn't
say
may
determine
eligibility,
it
is,
may
return
any
property
or
interest
vested
in
or
transferred
to
the
custodian.
whenever
such
officer
or
agency
shall
determine
that
the
person
who
has
filed
a
notice
of
claim
and
so
forth,
is
not
an
individual
who
was
at
anytime
after
december
7,
1941,
a
citizen,
a
subject
of
germany,
provided
and
this
is
the
pertinent
--
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
on
the
top
of
page
45,
“provided
that
notwithstanding
the
provision
of
this
subdivision
(d),
return
may
be
made
to
an
individual
who,
as
a
consequence
of
any
law,
decree,
or
regulation
of
the
nation
of
which
he
was
then
a
citizen
or
subject,
discriminating
against
political,
racial,
or
religious
groups,
as
at
no
time
between
december
7,
1941,
and
the
time
when
such
law,
decree,
or
regulation
was
abrogated,
enjoyed
full
rights
of
citizenship
under
the
law
of
such
nation."
and
then
subdivision
(5),
“and
that
such
return
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.”
now,
the
return
may
be
discretionary,
but
it
--
the
director
does
not
reach
consideration
for
return
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
until
he
has
first
determined
whether
the
claimant
is
eligible
for
return.
and
the
determination
of
eligibility,
the
first
stage
is
not
discretionary
for
if
a
claimant
meets
the
condition
laid
down
in
that
first
proviso,
32
(a)
(2)
(d).
if
he
establishes
that
he
was
a
person
in
germany
where
at
no
time
during
the
period
specified,
enjoyed
full
rights
of
german
citizenship
by
reason
of
a
decree,
law,
rule,
or
regulation
discriminating
against
a
political
religious
or
racial
group,
he
establishes
that
and
that
issue
must
be
determined
in
his
favor
and
he
must
be
deemed
eligible
to
be
considered
as
to
whether
return
to
him
shall
--
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
not
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
i
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
the
(voice

--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
i
think
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
they
are
different.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
--
i
submit
that
the
this
court,
the
district
court
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
--
has
the
power
to
determine
whether
the
determination
by
the
director
of
alien
property
that
he
was
ineligible
was
a
valid
determination,
whether
that
determination
was
made
on
the
standards
laid
down
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
the
district
court
--
the
district
court
looks
at
the
record
and
if
the
determination
of
the
attorney
general
is
based
on
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
as
a
whole,
if
it
supports
his
determination
of
ineligibility,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
the
district
court
has
the
power
to
review
the
record
and
determine
whether
the
attorney
general
exceeded
the
delegated
authority
whether
he
complied
with
the
statute
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
i
don't
say
that
and
the
complaint
does
not
allege
that.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
we
don't
say
that
on
the
face
of
this
complaint,
your
honor
please.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
what
we
say
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
that's
right.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
the
statute
says
that
but
our
complaint
goes
further
than
that.
we've
alleged
the
facts
bringing
us
within
the
statutory
condition.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
as
we
allege
it,
it
is
reviewable
and
what
we
allege,
we
go
further,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
we
say,
and
this
is
admitted
by
the
motion
to
dismiss,
at
page
5
of
the
record
in
the
complaint,
that
he
was
denied
admission
to
the
practice
of
law.
it
was
a
substantial
deprivation
of
his
rights
as
a
german
citizen
and
why?
because
he
was
a
known
opponent
of
nazism
and
considered
politically
unreliable,
an
anti-nazi,
such
as
the
plaintiff,
were
recognized
and
treated
as
a
political
group
by
nazi
authorities
and
under
nazi
laws.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
that's
an
allegation
of
fact.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
there
were
a
lot
of
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
but
there
weren't
millions
who
were
seeking
admission
to
the
practice
of
law,
if
i
may
suggest,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
not
all
those
who
were
denied
practice
of
the
law
were
considered
a
religious,
political,
or
racial
group,
but
those
who
were
known
opponents
of
nazism
and
who,
in
order
to
become
members
of
the
bar,
refused
the
invitation
to
join
the
party
in
order
to
get
their
license,
known
as
such
considered
politically
unreliable.
they
were
a
smaller
minority
than
the
millions
of
germans
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
--
who
were
not
members
of
the
nazis.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
i
think
that's
a
political
group,
it's
not
a
party.
they
were
a
group
of
persons,
indeed,
the
record
which
is
not
before
this
court
adduced
the
evidence
to
that
effect.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
that's
correct
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
--
your
honor.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
--
section
7
(c)
precludes
any
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
no.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
if
this
court
should
hold
in
the
petitioner's
favor,
the
--
there
would
be
a
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court,
as
we
suggest,
would
instruct
the
court
of
appeals
to
affirm
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
had
denied
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction.
it
then
goes
back
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
--
and
the
district
court,
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
review
the
records.
and
if
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
determination
of
the
director
of
alien
property,
and
if
the
record
impels
the
conclusion
that
it
was
arbitrary
or
capricious
determination
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
we
say
the
court
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
--
well,
we
ask
the
court
to
say
there's
jurisdiction
to
review
in
the
district
court.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
no,
no,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
we
are
not
saying
in
our
questions
as
we
presented
them,
do
not
place
before
this
court
the
question
of
whether
section
32
eligibility
consideration
is
discretionary.
that
is
not
the
question
as
i
see
it
before
this
court.
the
question
before
this
court
as
we
see
it
and
in
the
posture
of
the
pleading
and
the
motion
is
this,
whether
a
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit
to
review
a
--
the
--
a
government
agency's
determination
which
is
admitted
by
a
motion
to
dismiss
to
have
been
made
without
any
substantial
evidence
to
support
it
in
the
record
before
the
agency
and
which
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
that's
one.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
i
argue
that
if
one
construes
the
first
proviso
of
section
32
(a)
(2)
(d),
namely
a
determination
of
eligibility
that
is
not
discretionary.
but
assuming
for
the
discussion,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
it
is
discretionary,
i
submit
that
the
courts
always
have
power
to
review
to
see
if
the
action
is
valid,
if
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
they
can
turn
it
over.
courts
don't
always
review
whether
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
discretion
doesn't
give
any
agency
or
official,
the
arbitrary
fiat
to
determine
a
question
before
him
willingly
only
as
he
sees
better.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
that's
what
i
think.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
nothing
more
than
that.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
section
7
(c)
says
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
--
doesn't
quite
say
that.
it
says
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
"the
sole
relief
and
remedy
of
any
person
claiming
any
interest
in
property
shall
be
that
provided
for
by
this
act.”
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
by
the
terms
of
this
act.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
now
the
administrative
procedure
act,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
starts
out
in
section
10
by
saying,
"except
so
far
as
statutes
preclude
judicial
review."
and
that's
at
page
46
of
my
appendix
to
the
brief.
it
says
"except
so
far
as
statutes
preclude
judicial
review
or
agency
actions
by
law
committed
to
agency
discretion."
so,
looking
at
the
language
there,
the
question
is
not
whether
a
statute
precludes
judicial
review,
but
the
question
rather
is,
to
what
extent
does
that
statute
preclude
judicial
review?
that's
the
language
except
so
far
as.
now,
section
7
(c)
which
says
that
“the
sole
relief
and
remedy
of
any
person
having
any
claim
to
property
shall
be
that
provided
for
by
this
act,
could
have
no
relation
whatsoever
to
a
claim
under
section
32
for
these
reasons,
first,
it
was
enacted
in
1918
and
had
as
its
purpose,
the
speedy
capture
by
the
alien
property
custodian
of
enemy
property
which
he
had
vested
by
a
vesting
order.
it
was
to
prevent
litigation
and
delays
in
getting
that
property
into
his
hands.
now,
when
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
was
enacted
in
1917,
the
custodian
had
the
right
to
seize,
but
persons
who
held
property
here
instead
of
turning
over
the
property
which
was
vested,
forced
the
custodian
to
go
into
court
to
get
it,
because
they
claimed
there
was
no
enemy
interest
in
it.
in
order
to
(inaudible)
the
delays
that
followed
or
resulted,
congress
amended
section
7
(c)
in
1918.
and
they
there
provided
by
a
speedy
seizure
of
the
property
pursuant
to
the
vesting
order
and
any
non-enemy
who
claimed
there
was
no
enemy
interest,
could
then
by
the
sole
relief
and
remedy
provision,
go
into
court
under
9
(a)
to
get
his
property
back.
he
had
to
give
it
up
before
suing.
he
couldn't
as
theretofore
sue
and
hold
on
to
it
until
the
court
decided
in
favor
of
the
custodian,
that,
it
was
back
in
1918.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
section
32
proceeding,
which
came
on
years
later
in
1946.
now,
section
32
was
first
enacted
in
march
1946.
it
originally
provided
for
a
return
of
vested
property
to
what
are
called
the
technical
enemies.
they
were
the
residents
of
holland,
denmark,
the
occupied
countries,
france,
whose
property
was
seized
for
two
reasons,
to
protect
them,
protect
the
reasons
and
secondly,
to
prevent
germany
from
having
those
assets
available
to
be
used
against
the
united
states.
now,
when
the
war
was
over,
there
was
no
need
to
hold
on
to
those
assets.
section
32
was
enacted
to
provide
a
return
to
those
people.
it
provided
in
subdivision
(5)
that
before
a
return
be
made,
there
would
have
to
be
a
determination
that
the
return
was
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
now,
that's
a
broad
term,
but
the
purpose
of
including
that
provision
was
contained
in
the
records,
mr.
thorp,
who
was
then
the
assistant
secretary
of
state,
informed
congress,
i
have
mentioned
it
in
my
brief
that
the
purpose
of
the
interest
of
the
united
states
provision
was
to
make
certain
that
the
property
returned
to
a
so-called
“technical
enemy,”
would
not
be
returned
to
a
german
for
whom
that
technical
enemy
was
acting
as
a
cloak.
it
was
to
prevent
the
cloaking
situation
because
some
of
these
people
might
have
been
cloaks
for
the
germans.
and
then,
the
other
reason
given
was,
in
the
congressional
hearings,
to
bar
a
return
to
a
technical
enemy
wherein
the
judgment
of
the
state
department
--
for
example,
insufficient
reciprocal
protection
had
been
afforded
by
a
foreign
country
to
american
citizens
having
claims
against
it.
now,
several
months
later,
they
further
amended
section
32
(a)
(2)
(d),
that
was
on
august
1946,
by
incorporating
therein
the
first
proviso
of
section
32
(a)
(2)
(d),
to
return
to
those
persons
whom
congress
said
were
in
fact,
the
enemies
of
our
enemies,
the
persecuted
groups.
and
we
filed
our
claim
or
the
petitioner
did
on
this,
the
first
proviso
of
section
32
(a)
(2)
(d).
now,
congress
clearly
said
that
these
people
should
get
their
property
back,
that's
the
language
used.
and
we
say
that
if
the
petitioner
comes
within
the
condition
of
status
laid
down
in
that
first
proviso,
he
is
eligible
to
be
considered
for
return.
now,
we
say
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction.
it
has
jurisdiction
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
apart
from
the
administrative
procedure
act,
it
has
it
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
the
general
grant
of
federal
question
of
jurisdiction
for
the
district
courts.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
well,
your
honor,
must
--
must
you
not
also
consider
instead
of
the
word,
"no"
as
to
the
answer
to
the
question,
the
word,
"yes".
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
he
might
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
not
entirely.
it's
not
only
within
his
say-so,
but
he
must
consult
as
i
have
been
given
during
the
stand
from
what
his
former
counsel
said.
he
consults
with
several
of
the
other
agencies
as
to
whether
a
return
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
but
i
think,
your
honor,
where
that
in
determining
whether
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
that
determination
must
likewise
be
supported
by
valid
evidence.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
i
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
this
petitioner,
if
he
is
eligible,
if
he
does
meet
the
standards,
if
the
determination
of
ineligibility
was
without
substantial
evidence,
i
say
that
he
is
entitled
to
that
determination
by
the
director
of
alien
property
one
way
or
the
other.
he's
entitled
to
get
an
answer,
yes
or
no,
from
the
director
whether
return
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
if
this
petitioner
meets
the
standards.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
well,
that
--
that
is
a
suit
by
someone
who
claims
against
the
person
to
whom
the
return
is
being
made.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
we
have
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
we
say
it
was
done
without
substantial
evidence
on
the
record.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
we
had
less
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
well,
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
oh,
i
beg
to
differ,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
there
is
no
remedy
afforded
by
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
to
walter
schilling
to
review
any
determination
under
32
(a)
(2)
(d).
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
by
general
principles
of
law,
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
we
have
a
right
to
review
any
action
of
the
agency,
of
the
director
which
is
without
evidence
to
support
it.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
no
exception
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
well,
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
in
the
heikkila
--
brown
case
--
barber
case,
in
the
dissenting
opinion
which
your
honor
wrote,
in
which
mr.
justice
black
joined,
you
referred
at
some
length
to
the
colloquy
that
took
place
between
senator
mccarran
and
the
members
of
the
senate,
when
he
was
discussing
and
explaining
the
provisions
of
section
10.
and
i
think
your
honor
pointed
out
in
that
opinion
that
they
were
not
talking
about
judicial
review
in
the
technical
sense,
but
they
were
talking
about
access
to
a
court.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
in
that
opinion,
your
honor
said
that
they
were
not
talking
about
judicial
review,
in
the
technical
sense,
but
about
access
to
the
court.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
could
the
court
--
may
change
today
or
tomorrow.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
it's
done
that
before.
it
has
come
around
to
a
dissenting
judge's
point
of
view,
and
it
may
come
around
again.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
but
we
cite
--
we
cite
the
mcgrath-kristensen
case
where
the
attorney
general
had
refused
to
support
--
suspend
the
petitioner's
deportation
on
the
ground
of
violation
of
his
business
status
and
it
was
deemed
ineligible
for
citizenship
because
he
had
applied
for
relief
from
military
service.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
the
(inaudible)
we
cite
that.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
we
have
that
judiciable
--
justiciable
controversy.
the
same
controversy
that
was
--
you
might
say
in
perkins
v.
elg
and
mcgrath
v.
kristensen.
in
the
mcgrath
v.
kristensen,
this
court
said
that
it
didn't
find
necessary
to
consider
the
application
of
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
when
an
official's
authority
to
act
depends
upon
the
status
of
the
person
affected
in
that
case,
eligibility
for
citizenship,
that
status
when
in
dispute
maybe
determined
by
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
after
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
and
that
was
an
actual
controversy
between
the
alien
--
the
immigration
officials,
over
the
legal
right
of
the
alien
to
be
considered
for
suspension.
and
in
such
a
controversy
over
federal
law,
the
courts
had
jurisdiction.
now,
we
say
so
here.
the
director's
authority
to
act
depends
upon
the
status
of
the
petitioner.
in
this
case,
eligibility
for
return,
that
status
is
in
dispute.
it
may
be
determined
by
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
after
we
exhausted
this
administrative
proceeding.
but
i'll
go
further
and
may
i
turn
from
the
moment
to
a
case
which
the
respondent
cites
(inaudible)
case.
in
that
case,
they
take
the
position
that
this
return
is
a
gratuity.
they
can
do
anything
they
want
with
it,
like
to
recall
it.
well,
it's
granted,
but
a
--
a
return
of
vested
property
is
a
gratuity.
it's
been
so
held
and
that
congress
may
withdraw
it.
congress
has
not
withdrawn
it
here.
in
that
case,
which
came
up
under
the
dent
act,
an
act
to
provide
for
payment
of
compensation
of
those
who
would
furnish
supplies
and
services
during
world
war
i
and
didn't
have
any
contract
for
repayment.
the
dent
act
had
two
provisions.
a
determination
of
the
secretary
of
the
war
was
to
be
final
and
conclusive.
and
then
it
has
at
page
180,
267
u.s.,
it
has
this
paragraph
quote,
“that
nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
confer
jurisdiction
upon
any
court
to
entertain
a
suit
against
the
united
states.”
that
was
in
the
dent
act.
the
court
that
--
in
holding
for
the
secretary
of
war,
who
were
denied
an
award
of
some
$9000,
went
on
to
point
out
that
--
that
cases
which
the
claimant
had
cited
were
cases
in
which
it
was
held
that
no
court
could
reverse
or
control
the
secretary
by
mandamus
in
the
absence
of
anything
to
show
the
determination
was
capricious
or
arbitrary.
and
then
went
on
to
say,
“there
is
nothing
in
the
award
by
the
secretary
in
the
case
at
bar,
which
would
justify
characterizing
it
as
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
fraudulent
or
the
abuse
of
discretion.”
now,
there
is
just
one
more
thing
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
i'm
sorry.
i
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
when
congress
wishes
to
withhold
suit
or
bar
a
suit,
it
does
so,
specifically
as
it
did
in
the
veterans
administration
act,
the
house
cited
it.
it's
38
u.s.c.
211
(a),
where
congress
specifically
sends
that
the
determination
or
the
benefits
of
payments
under
the
va
by
the
administrator
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
and
no
other
official
or
any
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
power
or
jurisdiction
to
review
any
such
decision.
and
they
also
did
it
in,
public
law
285
in
the
85th
congress,
in
the
foreign
claims
settlement
act.
we
don't
have
that
here
in
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
mr.
chief
justice
i
did
run
over
my
time
yesterday,
but
--
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
just
confine
my
rebuttal
to
the
statements
made
by
mr.
kramer
on
the
point
that
the
legislative
history
and
particularly
the
fact
that
section
34
was
added
to
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
at
the
time
they
added
the
first
proviso
from
section
32
(a)
(2)
(d)
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
before
the
court
because
the
purpose
of
incorporating
the
right
to
sue
in
section
34,
the
debt
claim
provision
review
by
the
court
of
a
debt
claim
determination
was
clearly
pointed
out
in
the
hearings
before
--
it's
not
on
my
brief,
in
the
hearings
before
the
subcommittee
no.
1
and
committee
on
the
judiciary,
house
of
representatives,
79th
congress
on
house
bill
5089,
a
bill
to
amend
the
first
war
powers
act,
serial
no.
20.
and
it
is
there
stated
by
mr.
markham,
who
was
then
the
custodian,
that
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
in
markham
v.
cabell
which
had
held
that
one
could
sue
the
custodian
under
section
9
(a)
to
recover
from
the
vested
property
a
debt
owing
to
the
plaintiff.
there
would
be
a
first-come,
first-serve
situation
as
far
as
payment
of
the
debt
claims
were
concerned,
so
the
custodian
asked
legislation
to
take
away
from
section
9
(a),
and
it's
in
9
(a)
there
is
the
provision
that
any
person
not
an
enemy
or
ally
of
an
enemies,
it's
on
page
42,
claiming
or
to
whom
any
debt
may
be
owing
from
an
enemy
or
ally
of
an
enemy
whose
property
or
any
part
thereof
shall
have
been
conveyed
to
the
custodian
may
sue
the
custodian
or
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states
to
recover
on
his
debt
out
of
the
vested
property.
they
took
that
away
in
enacting
section
34
and
allowed
the
creditor
to
come-in
in
an
administrative
proceeding
and
if
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
administrative
proceeding
there
could
then
be
an
equitable
distribution
of
the
vested
assets
owing
by
the
former
property
owner
to
his
creditors
who
are
not
enemies
or
allies
of
enemies
and
section
34
is
based
on
the
national
bankruptcy
act.
there's
a
system
of
equitable
distribution
and
review
by
the
courts
of
the
mere
fact
that
they
did
that
in
the
same
act
which
incorporated
the
first
proviso
is
no
indication
and
no
proof
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
there
should
be
no
judicial
review
of
any
determination
by
the
custodian
which
was
without
supporting
evidence
or
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
void.
that
is
to
that.
now
as
to
the
real
point
here
on
section
32,
when
it
says
“may
return”
in
the
first
part,
the
word
“may”
relates
solely
to
the
return
of
the
property.
the
word
“may”
does
not
relate
to
a
determination
of
the
status
or
the
condition.
he
is
not
given
a
permissive
right
to
determine
whether
the
man
comes
within
the
conditions
laid
down
for
return.
“may”
in
that
sense
must
be
read
as
“shall”
or
mandatory
because
the
word
“may”
has
been
construed
in
a
statute.
it
has
been
construed
by
this
court
and
other
courts.
the
word
“may”
is
to
be
read
as
mandatory.
it
means
shall
or
must
whenever
it
is
necessary
to
carry
out
the
intent
of
the
legislature
that
has
enacted
the
particular
statute
in
which
the
word
is
found
and
to
carry
out
the
sense
of
the
policy
of
the
legislation.
now
congress
in
our
brief
quotes
congress
on
the
sense
and
purpose
of
the
first
proviso
of
section
32
(a)
(2)
(d).
congress
considered
these
people
who
were
persecuted
as
non-hostile
enemies.
congress
said
we
call
them
the
enemies
of
our
enemies.
they,
in
fact,
wanted
to
have
the
allied
course
succeed
they
should
have
their
property
back.
that's
the
exact
language
of
congress
in
the
reports.
since
that
is
the
sense
and
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
legislature
to
give
these
people
back
their
property
if
they
come
within
this
class,
then
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
word
“may”
which
only
relates
to
return
if
it
has
any
application
or
consideration
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
status
or
condition,
i
say
it
should
then
be
read
as
mandatory.
and
my
last
point,
if
the
court
please,
is,
that
the
issue
here
is
not
the
expertise
of
the
administrator.
he
is
not
an
expert
on
what
were
considered
political,
religious,
or
racial
groups
no
more
than
i
have.
he
must
determine
that
on
the
facts
adduced
on
the
record.
there
were
facts
adduced
here
on
the
record
before
the
hearing
examiner.
the
hearing
examiner
said
though
evidence
was
documentary
and
only
one
witness
was
called
by
the
petitioner.
he
names
that
witness
in
his
recommendation
and
findings.
that
witness
is
named
m.
magdalena
shack.
although
it
does
not
appear
here,
i
doubt
whether
the
government
will
deny
that
m.
magdalena
shack
is
an
employee
and
attorney
in
the
office
of
alien
property.
so
if
there
is
any
expertise
in
the
office
of
alien
property
to
determine
this
question,
m.
magdalena
shack,
an
employee
of
that
office,
a
former
lawyer
in
germany,
arium,
and
who
had
taught
one
semester
at
harvard
law
school,
who
was
the
witness
here
before
the
hearing
examiner
and
who
testified
to
the
conditions
in
germany
and
as
to
what
the
political
groups
and
knew
who
the
bar
examiners
were
and
the
chief
of
the
bar
examiners
then
i
say
we
have
in
the
records
the
expert
in
the
office
of
alien
property
that
supported
the
case
of
the
petitioner
which
evidence
was
disregarded
by
the
director
when
he
made
his
decision
and
we
say
that
was
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
void
and
if
it's
void,
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction.
it
has
jurisdiction
to
control
not
to
decide,
but
to
control
void
acts
of
an
agency.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
sir?
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
well.
mr.
henry
i.
fillman
thank
you.
