justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
discretionary,
as
you
read
the
statute
with
the
attorney
general,
to
decide
whether
he
is
or
isn't
within
the
class?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that,
sir?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
so
--
am
i
wrong,
i
thought
the
only
question
before
us
was
whether
or
not
that
section
7
(c)
of
the
act
precludes
any
judicial
remedy
in
a
case
of
this
sort
or
that
or
--
with
section
32
proceeding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
isn't
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
take
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
taking
your
position
is
that
if
--
we
hold
in
your
favor
on
that
score,
what
happens?
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court
or
goes
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
consideration
of
these
questions
as
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
scope
or
review
or
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
the
action
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
aren't
you
ahead
of
the
game,
we
don't
face
here
what
the
scope
or
review
is.
all
you're
asking
is
to
say
there
is
some
kind
of
review.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
aren't
saying
much.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
isn't
that
all
we've
got
before
us,
the
question
of
what
7(c)
means?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
more
than
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
noticed
you
don't
seem
to
rely
at
all
on
section
32
(e),
which
seems
to
me
to
have
some
significance,
neither
you
nor
the
government
discussed
it.
the
effect
of
which
section
as
i
understand
it
is
that
in
the
case
of
a
person
who
receives
property
under
32,
the
act
specifically
recognizes
that
there
may
be
a
suit
by
somebody
against
him
but
only
one
who
is
qualified,
would
have
been
qualified
to
receive
the
property
under
32
is
one
coming
within
that
provision.
it
seems
to
me
to
have
a
flavor
of
justiciability
on
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
in
order
for
the
--
such
a
person
to
bring
such
a
suit,
he
must
show
himself
to
have
been
one
who
had
--
he
applied
in
the
first
instance
to
the
attorney
general,
would
have
been
qualified
under
32
(d).
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
it
comes
to
the
determination
of
what
your
opponent
calls
status,
the
statute
says,
“shall
return”
and
not,
“may
return”.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
32
(e)
has
got
any
significance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
--
it
provides
that
--
as
an
instance
to
that
kind
of
a
claim
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
issue
is
to
whether
this
man
is
within
32
(d)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
a
justiciable,
litigable
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
that
context
i
quite
agree
it's
not
this,
it's
not
your
case,
does
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
shows
that
congress
had
some
--
it
has
this
much
relevancy
that
the
possible
--
that
issue
of
status
is
not
wholly
excluded
because
it's
--
it's
specifically
provided
for
as
litigable
in
that
context.
justice
john
m.
harlan
quite
right
but
it
did
not
say
that
the
man's
status
as
determined
by
the
attorney
general
was
to
govern
the
suit,
it
made
it
an
independent,
litigable
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
true.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
position
would
go
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
if
we
had
a
record
where
the
alien
property
custodian
said
i
am
not
going
to
concern
myself
at
all.
i'm
not
interested
in
whether
you
come
within
the
scope
of
this
section,
you
say
that
there
was
no
judicial
review
in
that
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
consequence
to
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that's
where
you
have
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
suggesting
at
all
that
there's
any
margin
to
review
once
the
--
that
the
--
once
the
alien
property
custodian
directs
his
attention,
directs
his
mind
to
the
question
whether
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
man
subject
to
section
32
(d).
i'm
not
raising
that
question.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
we
haven't
got
that
before
us
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
one
was
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
is
arguable
either
way
you
just
can't
tell,
where
does
that
leave
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
on
the
question
of
reviewability.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
both
got
fair
arguments
in
both
ways
otherwise
you
wouldn't
be
here
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
court
should
come
to
conclusion
that
you
just
can't
tell.
but
here
is
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
says
unless
the
statute
does
exclude
it
there
is
to
be
a
review
except
from
the
ground
of
agency
discretion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
--
where
does
that
leave
one?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
but
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
assuming
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
want
you
to
assume
my
premises
for
the
moment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
can't
carve
it
down
under
the
two-step
process
of
status
and
the
merit
as
well.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
give
us
any
idea
as
to
the
volume
of
these
claims,
have
they
been
very,
very
voluminous?
justice
john
m.
harlan
30?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that's
just
begging
the
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
just
begging
the
question,
not
arguing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
question
here
finds
that
on
better
argument.
