well,
i
gather
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
a
none
--
not
--
not
a
justiciable
controversy.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
mention
that
in
your
briefs
the
cases
under
the
deportation
statutes
where
questions
of
eligibility
for
--
eligibility
for
the
discretion
for
relief
--
discretionary
relief
of
the
attorney
general,
maybe
justiciable
one,
although
his
decision
not
to
exercise
that
discretion
was
not
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
--
not
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
even
though
--
even
though
(d)
(5)
might
--
as
justice
frankfurter
suggests
that
the
--
in
the
--
here
in
the
political
realm
unreviewable,
you
might
well
have
a
--
i'm
not
saying
that
this
is
your
--
it's
you're
right,
but
you
might
well
have
a
justiciable
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
person
qualifies
for
this
discretionary
relief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
seem
to
treat
it
in
your
briefs
the
kind
of
problem
that
we
had
in
the
--
in
the
accardi
case
--
the
--
versus
shaughnessy,
the
justiciable
questions
to
whether
or
not
a
or
b
or
c
was
in
the
category
of
people
who
are
eligible
through
the
exercise
by
the
attorney
general
of
his
discretion
for
suspension.
well,
and
the
court
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
the
court
made
quite
clear
that
while
the
--
it's
up
to
the
attorney
general
and
not
to
the
courts
to
determine
who
--
whether
the
discretion
to
suspend
should
be
exercised.
nevertheless,
whether
a
man
qualified
to
get
into
the
group
to
apply
it
for
suspension
was
justiciable.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
that
--
that
--
that
seems
though
on
the
surface
to
be
fairly
close
to
this
situation.
