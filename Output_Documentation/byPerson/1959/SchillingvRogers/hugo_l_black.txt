justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
one
the
court
relied
on,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
mean
in
the
motion
for
dismissal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
likely
to
arrive
elsewhere,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
had
been
a
question
here
as
to
citizenship
of
the
person,
did
the
attorney
general
had
tried
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
written
review.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
section
9
(a)
didn't
provide
it
and
he
was
a
citizen,
will
it
be
left
to
the
attorney
general
to
decide
it
without
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
testifying
it
without
the
review
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
constitutional
provisions
would
likely
affect
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
due
process
clause?
did
that
section
presented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
suppose
the
difference
is
if
an
alien
enemy
is
not
entitled
to
this
due
process
that's
under
the
due
process
clause
or
the
just
compensation
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
standard
under
which
he
has
to
determine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
he
says,
you'll
find
that
in
these
categories.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
standard
under
which
it
depends
on
that
and
the
custodian
decides
whether
he
should
nevertheless
reached
for
the
return
of
the
property
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
files
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we're
down
to
the
merits
now,
what's
the
standard
on
which
the
merits
are
determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
to
be
returned
for
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
sole
one.
it
means
that
i've
seen
the
major
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
answered
my
question
as
i
intended
to
ask
you
when
you
said
the
standard
what
i
asked
for
it
holding
you
--
are
going
to
be
in
the
category.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
he's
been,
that
he
is,
he
knows
he
belongs
there.
what
is
the
standard
that
the
attorney
general
must
follow
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
as
to
whether
he
shall
have
a
return
of
the
properties?
is
there
any
other
besides
five?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
ultimate
determining
of
the
standard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
--
assuming
that
he
comes
within
the
response
of
all
the
others.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
as
it
was
said
that
there
was
a
stipulation
that
he
did
then
it
could
still
deny
him
on
the
ground
that
the
custodian
thought
it
was
not
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
and
that
would
be
the
final,
ultimate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
standard
that
he
had
the
act
under.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
going
to
be
the
attorney
general.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
considered
him
as
the
ultimate
custodian?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
attorney
general
or
someone
under
him
(inaudible)
the
laws
and
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
the
--
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
attorney
general
more
power
and
that
would
give
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
said
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
maybe
the
court
said
to
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
--
i
would
presume
that
was
the
information
with
whatever
the
subject
is
constitutionally
speaking,
i
know
of
no
provision
in
the
constitution
that
requires
that
--
which
provides
that
something
could
make
him
the
president
with
the
attorney
general,
it
doesn't
even
express
to
the
deputy
attorney
general
unless
--
unless
you're
saying
that
the
constitution
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
do
a
certain
thing.
i'm
talking
about
delegation
of
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
it
here?
