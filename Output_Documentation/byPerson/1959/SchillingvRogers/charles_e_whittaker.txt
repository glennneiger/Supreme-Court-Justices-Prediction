justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
fillman,
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
in
order
to
maintain
that
position
as
i
understand
you,
you
argue
that
there
are
two
questions,
not
one
.namely,
one,
is
--
that
is
that
--
or
the
eligibility
is
not
one
of
discretion,
that's
the
first
question,
you
say.
then
you
say
next
after
eligibility
has
been
determined
whether
or
not
the
relief
shall
be
granted
is
the
discretionary
matter,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
not
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
not
true
though
that
regardless
of
the
allegation,
it
must
be
taken
with
the
statute.
and
if
the
statute
gives
a
discretion
to
the
attorney
general
and
it
ended
at
that
place,
there
would
be
no
court
jurisdiction.
and
is
that
not
why
you
argue
that
that's
only
the
foot
in
the
door
or
--
or
the
use
--
do
you
argue
that
there
is
no
discretion
in
that
respect?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
can't
have
any
averment
here
that
the
district
abused
its
discretion.
you
don't
allege
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it's
only
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
district
court
that
would
be
reviewable
here
if
7
(c)
is
to
be
given
affect
according
to
its
terms,
which
says,
“there
shall
be
no
review
except
as
provided
in
the
act”.
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
the
terms
of
this
act.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
only
with
respect
to
9
(a)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
the
question
would
be
did
or
not
exercise
good
faith,
is
your
argument
valid
would
it
not
mean
that
this
relief
would
be
only
when
congress
or
to
induce
the
discharge
of
that
person
and
get
someone
of
the
more
liberal
discretion.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
would
assume
and
is
this
right
or
wrong
that
there
is
no
doubt
of
congress'
power
to
deny
judicial
review
in
such
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
they
have
done
so,
then
the
fact
that
the
mistrust
may
have
been
arbitrarily
exercised
even
by
the
administrator
wouldn't
grant
judicial
review,
would
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
i
understand
you
to
concede
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
there
is
mandatory
language
in
section
32?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
reference
was
made
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
reference
was
made
to
the
word,
“shall.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
as
i
read
this,
it
appears
on
page
44
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
president
or
certain
law
officers
he
may
designate
may
return
the
property
or
the
proceeds
thereof
whenever
the
president
or
such
officer
or
agency
shall
determine,
then
follows
one
and
then
follows
two
that
such
owner
and
legal
representative
or
it's
just
an
interest
of
any
are
not,
then
follows
(d)
and
then
(d)
says,
“provided
that
notwithstanding
provisions
of
sub
--
subdivision
(d)
return
may
be
made
to
an
individual
who
as
a
consequence
of
such
rule.
now
i
fail
to
see
the
basis
upon
which
you
feel
there
is
any
mandatory
language
because
the
word,
“shall”
relates
only
to
“if
he
shall
find.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
point.
