mr.
robert
kramer
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
which
the
government
has
maintained
consistently
ever
since
1944
when
the
predecessor
of
the
bill
which
eventually
became
section
32
when
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
was
first
introduced
with
congress.
the
government
has
maintained
its
position
ever
since
then
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
of
determinations
made
under
section
32,
that
the
district
court,
as
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
committee
have
found
here
and
as
that
court
had
found
in
four
previous
cases
involving
the
same
issue.
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
we
think
this
is
true,
first,
because
a
fair
reading
of
the
language
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
demonstrates
that
there
was
to
be
no
judicial
review
under
section
32.
we
think
it
is
true,
second,
because
a
fair
interpretation
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
32
also
demonstrates,
there
is
to
be
no
judicial
review.
in
the
third
place
we
think
it's
true
because
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
whole
pattern
of
the
way
that
congress
has
dealt
with
seizures
of
property
of
enemy
aliens
or
to
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
supports
this
conclusion.
and
finally,
we
think
it
is
true
because
there
were
very
strong
reasons
of
policy
which
undoubtedly
influenced
congress
here
in
not
providing
for
review,
in
believing
there
should
be
no
review
and
those
reasons
of
policy
we
think
are
--
are
persuasive.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
the
first
that
i
would
in
particular
refer
to,
the
language
of
section
32
itself,
the
language
contained
in
section
9
(a)
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
here,
the
two
notable
things
about
section
32.
first,
it
is
completely
certain
as
far
as
judicial
review
is
concerned,
it
makes
no
provision
for
it
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
kramer
we
believe
it
does
when
you
consider
it
with
the
legislative
history
of
section
32
and
when
you
read
it
together
with
the
rest
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
mr.
robert
kramer
we
also
believe
that
the
language
of
section
32
has
been
brought
out
previously
in
this
argument
confers
extremely
wide
discretion.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes,
exactly.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
let's
start
off
here.
at
the
very
first
start
it
says,
"the
president
may
return."
now
the
word
"may"
there
was
not
used
merely
accidentally.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
original
hearings
before
the
house
committee,
when
this
was
first
introduced,
at
least
two
witnesses,
mr.
carter
(ph)
and
mr.
charles
carroll
(ph)
very
strongly
objected
to
the
use
of
that
word
,"may"
and
suggested
that
instead,
it
should
be
changed
to
"shall
return"
in
there
in
order
to
eliminate
that
discretion.
congress
did
not
so
change
it.
the
alien
property
custodian
wrote
a
letter
to
the
house
committee
in
which
he
opposed
the
change
from
"may"
to
"shall".
mr.
robert
kramer
it
simply
said,
“he
shall
determine
the
status.”
but
it
says
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
it
simply
requires
him
to
make
the
determination.
he
has
begged
the
determination
here.
there's
no
question
of
the
alien
property
custodian
for
choosing
to
make
the
determination.
that,
i
take
it
is
what
petitioner
complains
about.
when
it
says
"he
shall
determine,"
it
simply
means
he
shall
determine
whether
or
not
this
particular
person
is
eligible
just
as
it
says
here
down
in
section
5.
it
says,
"the
president
shall
determine
that
such
return
is
in
the
public
interest."
well,
i
take
it,
no
one
would
argue
that
that
removes
the
discretion
within
section
5
because
it
begins
there,
“the
president
shall
determine
that
such
return.”
it
simply
means
that
if
the
alien
property
custodian
i
--
i
--
arbitrarily
says,
"i
won't
make
any
determination
at
all
here."
i
just
moved
after
your
petition.”
mr.
robert
kramer
i
suppose
that
at
least
that
could
be
argued.
mr.
robert
kramer
and
we
recognize
that
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
we
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
we
mentioned
that
in
the
last
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
page
27
of
our
brief
be
treated
--
i
grant
you
very
briefly.
however,
i
think
we
also
go
on
to
discuss
in
our
brief
on
pages
29,
30
and
31,
the
other
cases
referred
to
by
counsel
here,
the
elg
case
and
the
kristensen
case.
all
those
cases
we
think,
involved
in
the
first
place
a
different
statute.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
pointed
out
the
determining
questions
of
judicial
review,
one
must
look
to
the
specific
language
and
the
specific
background
of
the
statute
involved,
and
that's
what
we
are
attempting
to
do
here.
that's
what
we're
attempting
to
do
here.
furthermore,
both
the
perkins
case
and
the
kristensen
case
involve
the
question
of
citizenship
which
this
court
pointed
out
in
those
opinions
raised
grave
constitutional
issue.
in
this
particular
case,
at
no
time
has
any
constitutional
issue
have
been
raised
by
petitioner,
either
here
or
in
the
court
below.
furthermore,
in
both
the
perkins
case
and
the
kristensen
case,
the
--
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
real
issue
was
not
there
whether
there
should
be
any
judicial
review
because
in
both
those
cases,
there
was
a
threat
of
deportation.
and
if
and
when
the
petitioner
in
those
cases
was
taken
into
custody
for
deportation,
the
constitution
would
have
required
judicial
review
by
habeas
corpus.
the
issue
in
those
cases
really
was
whether
--
was
the
time
of
obtaining
judicial
review
and
the
method
whether
by
declaratory
judgment
or
habeas
corpus.
mr.
robert
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
you
mean
by
“legal,”
or
“justiciable”.
if
you
mean,
“might
a
court
decide
it?”
the
answer
obviously
is,
yes.
if
you
mean,
“has
congress
intended
for
the
court
to
decide
it?”
it
is
the
government's
position
that
congress
did
not
so
intend.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
position
the
government
has
taken
consistently
from
1944,
when
this
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
the
original
bill
or
section
32
was
introduced
in
congress.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
as
far
as
--
as
i
know,
this
--
the
distinction
that
--
that
you
are
--
are
growing,
so
to
speak,
and
that
the
counsel
of
petitioner
has
drawn
this
two
or
three-step
status
had
--
was
never
suggested
to
congress.
it
is
actually
--
that
is
not
the
way
that
we
pointed
in
our
brief
that
the
alien
property
director
has
often
decided
cases.
he
has
sometimes
refused
to
make
a
return
because
he
found
that
the
petitioner
did
not
actually
ever
own
the
property,
without
ever
considering
whether
the
petitioner
was
or
was
not
a
--
a
national
discriminated
against
a
member
of
a
group.
he
has
--
sometimes
made
--
without
making
that
determination,
he
has
simply
followed
a
certification
from
a
foreign
government.
and
i
think
incidentally,
that
--
i
see
it's
time
for
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
section
32
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
is
silent
about
the
question
of
judicial
review
and
makes
no
provision
for
it
and
in
addition,
it
contains
language
giving
extremely
wide
discretionary
powers
and
authority
dealing
with
the
return
of
property.
the
government,
however,
wants
to
make
it
clear
that
it
does
not
rest
its
case,
dealing
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
here,
on
the
language
of
section
32,
which
is
simply
silent
on
the
matter
of
judicial
review.
section
32
is
simply
one
of
some
40
odd
sections
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
it
must
be
considered
with
the
other
sections
of
the
act.
turning
to
other
sections
of
the
act,
we
find
at
least
two
such
sections
which
on
their
face
would
seem
in
sweeping
language
to
bar
judicial
review
under
section
32.
the
first
of
those
sections
is
the
one
mentioned
by
petitioner's
counsel
yesterday
section
7
(c)
found
in
petitioner's
brief
at
page
41.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes,
that
is
the
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
in
this
case
and
in
the
four
other
cases
--
mr.
robert
kramer
yes
sir
and
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
it
in
the
four
other
cases
where
it
similarly
had
to.
the
same
question
has
been
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
this
from
the
five
times
including
this
case
and
that
each
case
in
that
court
has
reached
the
same
result
relying
as
you
say
on
section
7
(c).
mr.
robert
kramer
i
think
in
the
first
case,
mcgrath
against
zenith
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
that
is
the
leading
opinion
and
the
one
which
is
simply
to
a
large
extent
been
followed
since
then.
in
this
case
the
opinion
was
simply
a
per
curiam.
mr.
robert
kramer
no
other
court
of
appeals,
no.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
issue
was
only
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
language
of
section
--
mr.
robert
kramer
no,
that
is
right.
the
question
--
the
language
of
section
7
(c)
is
very
broad.
it
reads
in
part
the
sole
relief
and
remedy
of
any
person
having
any
claim
to
any
money
or
other
property
heretofore
or
hereafter
conveyed,
transferred,
assigned,
delivered
or
paid
over
to
the
custodian
shall
be
that
provided
by
the
terms
of
this
act.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
should
think
not
ordinarily
because
the
attorney
general
or
the
alien
property
custodian
before
would
be
ordinarily
be
the
defendant
and
therefore
the
action
ordinarily
i
should
think
wouldn't
be
brought
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct,
yes.
now
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
a
significant
section
which
is
found
in
our
brief
on
page
33,
section
9
(f)
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
section
9
(f)
in
part
reads
as
follows
“except
as
herein
provided
the
money
or
other
property
conveyed,
transferred,
assigned,
delivered,
paid
to
the
custodian
shall
not
be
subject
to
any
order
or
decree
of
any
court.
now
i
think
section
9
(f)
is
particularly
significant
because
section
9
is
the
key
section
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
insofar
as
a
judicial
review
is
concerned.
section
9
(a)
--
mr.
robert
kramer
not
--
well
not
--
today
that
is
true.
that
is
today
section
9
(a)
allows
judicial
review
in
the
case
of
either
citizens
or
non-enemy
aliens.
however,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
after
world
war
i,
congress
also
enacted
sections
9
(b)
and
9
(c)
which
allowed
judicial
review
for
enemy
aliens.
now
contrast
to
what
congress
did
after
world
war
i
when
it
specifically
allowed
judicial
review
in
9
(b)
and
9
(c)
with
what
congress
did
after
world
war
ii
when
they
enacted
section
32
and
said
nothing
at
all
about
judicial
review.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
right.
as
the
legislative
--
to
go
into
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
pattern
that
was
envisaged
for
relief
after
world
war
ii,
so
to
speak,
was
a
two-fold
one.
first,
under
section
9
(a),
there
was
to
be
judicial
review
and
so
to
speak
a
mandatory
return
for
all
non-enemy
aliens.
section
9
(a)
gave
an
absolute
right
of
judicial
review
for
them,
but
then
as
the
--
as
the
alien
property
custodian
pointed
out
to
the
congressional
committee,
section
32
was
to
provide,
so
to
speak,
another
remedy.
it
was
a
remedy
that
might
be
utilized,
if
they
so
wish,
by
even
by
not
enemy
alien
but
it
could
also
be
utilized
by
enemy
aliens,
but
because
it
could
be
utilized
by
enemy
aliens,
it
was
envisaged
as
one
that
was
purely
administrative.
it
gave
wide
discretion
to
the
administrator
and
there
was
to
be
no
judicial
review
under
it.
now
it's
significant
that
congress
considered
section
32
for
almost
two
years
from
1944
to
1946.
this
was
not
something
that
was
rushed
through
congress
under
great
war
of
pressure.
congress
took
plenty
of
time.
furthermore,
the
original
of
section
32
(a)
was
legislation
drafted
by
the
alien
property
custodian
and
the
attorney
general.
they
sent
a
joint
letter
which
is
found
in
our
brief
on
pages
12
and
13
in
which
they
state
that
the
purpose
of
section
32
(a)
was
to
provide
administrative
remedy
with
wide
discretion
and
that
there
was
not
to
be
any
judicial
review
under
section
32
(a).
this
was
not
only
their
understanding,
it
was
the
understanding
of
witnesses
who
appeared
before
the
congressional
committee
and
who
criticized,
they
then
draft
the
32
(a).
for
instance
the
testimony
of
mr.
carroll
which
is
found
in
our
brief
on
pages
13
and
14.
in
other
words
it
was
the
general
consensus
of
opinion
that
there
was
not
to
be
a
judicial
review
under
32
(a).
judicial
review
was
to
be
under
section
9,
not
under
32,
not
under
32
(a).
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
in
--
mr.
robert
kramer
i
think
if
it's
a
question
of
citizenship
there
would
have
been
alternate
forms
of
relief.
if
--
mr.
robert
kramer
there
would
have
been
alternate
forms.
if
the
petitioner
had
wished,
he
could
have
asked
for
administrative
determination
under
section
32,
but
if
he
did
not
wish
to
do
that,
he
could
have
gone
into
court
under
section
9
(a)
and
claimed
that
he
was
an
american
citizen
and
that
issue
wouldn't
be
subject
to
judicial
review
under
section
9
(a).
mr.
robert
kramer
well
it
seemed
to
me
that
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
i
believe.
you
could
--
construing
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
this
court
has
intimated
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
judicial
remedy
given
by
section
9
(a)
constitutional
issues
would
be
raised
in
the
type
of
case
you
put.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
i
should
think
one
constitutional
provision
would
be
that
it
would
be
taking
property
without
due
compensation
if
this
was
the
property
of
an
american
citizen.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
might
well
be
that
to
--
the
taking
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process,
if
it
were
of
an
american
citizen
though.
mr.
robert
kramer
and
that
has
been
the
indication
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
i
might
add
that
the
petitioner
has
not
raised
any
constitutional
issue
anytime
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
kramer
very
likely,
yes.
that
is
quite
true.
now
there's
also
significance
that
section
32
(a)
when
it
was
enacted
by
congress
was
part
of
public
law
322
and
that
law
contained
other
amendments
to
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
one
of
those
amendments
related
to
section
22
which
deals
with
consulting
and
that
amendment
enacted
at
the
same
time
section
32
(a),
that
amendment
is
section
20
expressly
provided
for
judicial
review
under
section
20.
in
other
words
that's
a
pretty
clear
indication
that
whenever
congress
has
wanted
a
judicial
review
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
they
had
said
so.
and
the
reason
they
had
said
so
is
because
undoubtedly
they
realized
that
they
didn't
say
so.
then
the
provisions
of
7
(c)
and
9
(f)
would
operate
to
bar
a
review.
now
you
find
the
same
pattern
again
when
a
few
months
later
in
august,
1946,
congress
amended
section
32
(a)
and
enacted
the
proviso
herein
question
dealing
with
discrimination
against
groups
for
political
reasons.
first
of
all
you
discover
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
on
pages
16
and
17
that
the
alien
property
custodian
wrote
a
letter
to
determine
in
the
house
judiciary
committee
which
the
chairman
read
with
his
approval
to
the
house
in
which
the
alien
property
custodian
pointed
out
that
he
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
certain
amendments
and
changes
that
the
senate
had
made
in
section
33
which
deal
with
the
statute
of
limitations
that
none
of
those
amendments
and
changes
in
his
judgment
operated
to
give
any
judicial
review
under
section
32
(a).
the
amendments
as
a
matter
of
fact
of
section
32
(a)
said
again
did
not
deal
with
judicial
review.
furthermore,
these
august
amendments
again
were
part
of
public
law
number
671.
public
law
671
made
other
changes
to
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
one
of
those
changes
was
that
it
added
section
34
to
the
act.
now
section
34
deals
with
the
so-called
death
claim,
that
is
the
claims
of
american
citizens
against
the
properties
that
have
been
--
have
been
seized
by
the
alien
property
custodian
and
again
it
is
significant
that
section
34,
as
added
here
in
1946
of
august,
specifically
provides
for
judicial
review.
the
matter's
not
left
up
in
the
air.
in
other
words,
every
time
congress
has
wanted
judicial
review
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
it
has
said
so
expressly.
it
said
so
in
section
9,
it
said
so
in
section
20,
it
said
so
section
34
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
since
1946
on
at
least
two
occasions
bills
have
been
introduced
in
congress
to
amend
section
32
(a)
to
provide
expressly
for
judicial
review,
none
of
those
bills
have
ever
been
enacted.
now
turning
to
for
a
moment
from
the
legislative
history
and
from
the
wording
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
it
also
seems
to
the
government
that
there
were
very
sound
policy
reasons
that
undoubtedly
influenced
congress
here
not
to
desire
to
have
judicial
review.
congress
probably
realized
that
they
were
not
dealing
here
with
a
statute
which
would
involve
the
liberty
of
any
person.
there
was
no
question
here
of
imprisonment,
no
question
here
of
deportation,
no
question
here
of
putting
anyone
in
the
armed
forces
against
his
will
of
drafting
anybody
for
service.
there's
no
question
here
as
i
made
plain
of
citizenship.
there
is
no
question
here
of
any
administrative
body
blackening
anybody's
reputation.
there
is
no
question
here
of
depriving
anyone
of
the
right
to
vote
or
the
right
of
free
speech.
congress
undoubtedly
viewed
this
proposition
simply
as
an
act
of
grace.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
really
do
not,
mr.
justice
since
so,
as
i
read
section
32
(a),
my
interpret
--
32
(e)
excuse
me.
my
interpretation
is
32
(e)
deals
with
the
claims
of
americans
or
other
creditors
against
the
seized
properties.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
but
it
provides
that
it
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well
first
--
mr.
robert
kramer
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
not
only
is
it
dealing
with
the
different
issue,
but
there
it
is
dealing
with
the
question
of
judicial
suit
not
judicial
review,
but
judicial
suit
after
return
has
been
made
to
the
property.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
of
course
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
oh
no,
this
is
perfectly
fit.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
right.
congress
consciously
and
deliberately
withheld
it
and
as
i
started
to
say
i
think
there
are
--
are
some
reasons
why
congress
did
if
you
stop
and
think
about
it,
take
the
factual
situation
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
admittedly
is
a
german
national.
during
the
entire
period
of
the
war,
he
was
in
germany.
now
in
order
to
classify
these
claims,
one
must
ascertain
facts
that
occurred
in
germany.
one
must
deal
with
questions
of
german
law
of
what
the
nazi
government
did
or
did
not
do.
all
those
questions
may
be
particularly
difficult
of
judicial
proof
accurately
in
a
court
of
law.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
i
think
--
mr.
robert
kramer
it
has
been
the
govern
--
certainly
it's
the
government's
position
--
mr.
robert
kramer
yes
you
were
pushing
that
undoubtedly,
mr.
justice
to
the
most
extreme
form.
mr.
robert
kramer
not
necessarily
it
seems
to
me
because,
one,
can
i
suppose
to
distinguish
between
a
case
a
where
the
alien
property
custodian
simply
said,
“i
won't
decide
this
case.”
mr.
robert
kramer
and
he
did
here.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
in
this
--
no.
in
this
case,
he
did
direct
his
mind
to
it
and
as
you
will
--
if
you
--
this
court
will
read
the
decisions
both
of
the
trial
examiner
and
the
custodian
which
are
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
also
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
--
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
one
can
--
can
easily
put
extreme
cases.
i
think
one
can
put
even
a
more
extreme
case.
suppose
the
allegation
was
that
the
alien
property
custodian
has
been
bribed
or
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
there
was
fraud.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
think
it
is
the
government
--
government's
position
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well
of
course
that
is
not
our
case
but
to
take
up
your
hypothetical
case,
i
think
that
it
is
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
statute
here
whether
or
not
this
court
will
ultimately
agree
in
the
extreme
you
case
put.
it's
fair
interpretation
of
this
statute.
that
congress
here
considered
this
matter
and
they
meant
generally
speaking
for
the
decision
of
the
director
to
be
final.
now
they
recognize
the
fact
that
anyone
to
whom
you
give
the
power
to
make
a
final
decision,
the
judge
here,
or
the
attorney
general
or
even
the
president
can
make
a
mistake.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
i
think
in
such
a
case
of
willful
--
actual
willful
bad
faith
that
there
--
there
might
well
be
judicial
review.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
would
say
there
--
that's
it's
simply
a
question
of
mistake
no
matter,
so
to
speak,
how
bad
a
mistake
it
is
nevertheless
if
he
--
if
he's
acted
in
good
faith
and
exercises
discretion
that
there
is
no
judicial
review.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
i
--
i
presume
that
if
the
alien
property
custodian
acted
in
any
of
these
horrible
ways
we're
talking
about
that
either
the
attorney
general
or
the
president
after
all
to
whom
the
power
is
directly
delegated
would
be
first
person
to
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
the
government's
position,
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
as
i
--
as
i
said
it
seems
--
it
seems
to
the
government
that
you
have
a
--
an
unusual
area
here
an
area
where
you
are
dealing
in
--
in
a
sense
in
the
field
of
foreign
relations
in
foreign
affairs.
as
we
--
we
point
out
--
out
in
our
brief
again,
actually
the
alien
property
custodian
of
the
government
have
found
that
it
desirable
to
handle
many
of
these
claims
under
section
32
(a)
simply
by
direct
agreement
with
a
foreign
government,
france
or
italy,
rather
than
go
--
going
through
the
ordinary
process
of
a
hearing.
this
--
this
area
comes
very
close
to
the
area
of
foreign
relation
and
treaty
questions.
in
fact
the
--
the
scheme,
the
general
scheme
in
having
on
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
is
shown
by
section
39
of
the
act
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
is
that
congress
has
said
that
in
general
enemy
aliens
are
to
look
to
their
own
government
for
relief
for
this
type
of
seizure.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
you
say
that
the
statute
--
maybe
either
way
you
mean
that
on
the
merits
or
the
question
of
judicial
review?
mr.
robert
kramer
well
on
the
question
of
reviewability,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
does
not
fall
under
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well
the
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
is
two-fold
that
(a)
the
statute
does
preclude
review
under
section
7
(c)
and
9
(f)
and
therefore
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
and
(b)
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well
(b)
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well
i
don't
know
if
he
wants
or
want
to
assume
the
second
premise.
the
second
exception
in
the
apa
is
where
the
thing
is
committed
to
agency
discretion.
mr.
robert
kramer
and
it
seems
to
the
--
the
government's
position
that
under
the
old
scheme
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
it
was
meant
to
commit
this
matter
under
section
32
to
agency
discretion.
mr.
robert
kramer
we
certainly
you
do
not
believe
that
that
is
what
congress
intended.
there's
nothing
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
to
reflect
that.
and
certainly
that
has
never
been
the
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
alien
property
custodian
from
1946
until
the
present
date.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
the
only
“shall”
is
--
is
involved
is
that
“he
shall
make
a
determination.”
that
brings
up
the
point
i
suppose
that
we
have
just
discussed.
if
the
alien
property
custodian
simply
said,
“i
won't
even
decide
this
case.
i
won't
even
pass
upon
it.
i
will
give
you
a
decision.
you
filed
your
claim
well
the
claim
could
not
gather
dust
in
my
file
box.”
well
then
the
act
says
he
shall
determine
but
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
what
his
determination
shall
be,
there
the
act
simply
says,
“he
may
return.
he
may
return,”
it's
discretionary
and
he
gives
them
very
broad
discretions.
it
says
he
may
return
it
and
then
it
lists
several
conditions,
one
of
which
is
if
he
finds
that
the
return
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
no,
i
think
that
is
going
too
far.
mr.
robert
kramer
no
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
is
going
too
far
because
i
think
--
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
no,
i
should
say
that
naturally
because
i
would
get
back
to
case.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
clear
case
of
bad
faith.
mr.
robert
kramer
the
standards,
i
suppose,
are
the
conditions
laid
down
in
section
32
of
the
act.
32
(a)
lays
down
a
series
of
conditions,
32
(a)
(1)
--
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
assuming
that
he
is
in
the
category
then
he
must
meet
the
other
conditions
such
as
32
(a)
(1)
says
he
must
have
filed
his
notice
of
complaint.
mr.
robert
kramer
and
then
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well
--
mr.
robert
kramer
the
main
standard
as
i
judge
is
in
32
(a)
(5),
namely
that
the
return
as
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
kramer
no.
that
is,
i
think,
the
sole
one
if
you
decide
the
other
that
he
meets
the
other
half
of
the
categories.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes,
that's
the
way
i
understood
your
question,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
there
the
conditions
laid
down
also
in
--
in
three
and
four.
three
says
that
the
property
or
interest
claim
was
not
at
anytime
after
september
1,
1939
held
by
or
used
with
the
consent
of
any
person
who
was
the
owner
thereof
pursuant
to
any
arrangement
to
conceal
any
property
or
interest.
in
other
words,
this
was
not
one
of
these
“cloaking"
arrangements.
and
then
the
--
and
then
there
is
another
standard
in
--
in
section
4
that
there
is
no
actual
or
potential
liability
under
the
renegotiation
act,
in
respect
of
the
property
or
interest
to
be
returned.
and
so
he
must
meet
--
roughly
there
are
five
things
he
must
meet
there.
and
the
last
one,
number
five,
of
course,
is
the
broadest
one,
namely,
that
in
some
respect
it's
the
broadest
one,
namely,
that
such
return
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
--
well
in
the
sense
it
is
but
i
suppose
that
the
--
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
who?
mr.
robert
kramer
no.
mr.
robert
kramer
it
would
be
attorney
general.
mr.
robert
kramer
and
he
might
even
be
the
president
if
he
wished
to
be.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well
i
think
the
attorney
general
could
--
mr.
robert
kramer
no,
i
think
not
--
mr.
robert
kramer
under
the
present
regulations,
the
attorney
general
would
simply
not
delegate
it
fully
his
powers
to
the
director
of
alien
property.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
then
perhaps
it
might
make
a
difference.
mr.
robert
kramer
under
the
present
set
up
i
might
say
that
the
way
it
operates
is
that
in
what
are
--
what
are
known
as
the
--
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
think
in
only
a
few
instances.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
think
in
many
--
as
i
understand
it
in
certain
instances
at
least
the
problem
has
involved
secret
or
highly
classified
information
and
therefore
it
has
not
been
fully
divulged
in
the
opinion.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
there'd
been
relatively
few
cases
actually
that
have
gone
off
on
that
ground.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
here
it
is
--
let
me
explain
to
you
briefly
the
way
the
situation
now
operates.
the
initial
hearing
is
before
the
trial
examiner
who
makes
his
recommended
decision.
it
then
goes
to
the
director
of
alien
property.
he
makes
his
decision.
his
decision
is
final
except
where
as
in
this
case
more
$50,000
is
involved
or
maybe
involved,
or
except
where
a
novel
or
unusual
question
of
law
or
policy
is
involved
in
those
accepted
cases
so
speak,
the
attorney
general
is
given
an
opportunity
to
review
the
case
and
the
decision
does
not
become
final
until
the
attorney
general
has
reviewed
the
case
as
was
the
situation
here.
ordinarily
reviewing
the
case,
unless
the
attorney
general
disagrees
with
the
decision
of
the
director,
he
does
not
write
another
opinion.
he
simply
says
that
he
has
reviewed
it
and
he
adopts
the
decision
of
the
director
as
his
own.
that
is
the
procedure
followed.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes,
we
have
reference
in
that
in
our
brief.
you
will
find
there
on
page
20
of
our
brief
note
--
excuse
me,
page
30
of
our
brief.
mr.
robert
kramer
footnote
25,
i
believe
we
have.
your
reference
there,
there
have
been
approximately
12,000
claims
down
to
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
1957.
now
those
are
all
types
of
claims
under
section
32,
a
very
substantial

mr.
robert
kramer
there's
mandatory
language,
i
think,
in
the
sense
that
the
director
must
make
a
decision.
mr.
robert
kramer
they
must
decide
--
decide
the
case.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
think
the
basis
in
the
argument
is
that
the
language
indicates
that
congress
intended
him
to
make
a
determination.
it
intended
however
for
his
determination
to
be
within
his
discretion.
congress
did
not
intend
him
simply
to
receive
the
claim
and
do
nothing
about
it.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
think
that
is
the
point.
