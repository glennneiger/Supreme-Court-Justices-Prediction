warren
number
319,
walter
schilling,
petitioner,
versus
william
p.
rogers,
attorney
general.
mr.
fillman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
have
to
be
very
brief,
because
you're
five
minutes
overtime
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
what
particular
language
in
the
statute
you
refer
to,
to
substantiate
that
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
32,
what
does
that
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
that's
included.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
have
the
other
--
the
rest
of
the
statute
that
you
rely
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
now,
what
language?
i
just
want
--
i
want
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
--
mr.
kramer,
granting
that
this
--
that
the
discretion
of
--
of
the
president
is
as
broad
as
you
--
as
you've
interpreted
it
here,
isn't
the
question
as
to
whether
the
man
falls
into
one
of
these
groups,
a
--
a
legal
question,
a
justiciable
question,
or
is
that
also
a
matter
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
director?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
mean
that
--
that
congress
intended
that
the
director
should
determine
there's
a
legal
question
whether
the
group
this
man
is
in
was
within
the
statute
or
not.
and
that
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
his
decision,
there
is
no
review.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
the
question
as
to
whether
the
man
belong
to
the
group,
but
as
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
group
itself
came
within
the
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
suppose
the
--
to
go
--
we'll
just
take
it
one
step
further
and
say
that
the
--
that
the
facts
--
the
stipulated
facts
in
the
case
would
clearly
show
that
the
man
was
within
that
group
and
the
--
the
administrators
or
examiners
said,
“well
i'm
going
to
deny
him
anyway.”
well
couldn't
--
couldn't
the
court
reach
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
not
dealing
with
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
dealing
with
--
with
a
situation
where
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
that
--
that
you
have
in
the
case
would
show
clearly
that
this
man
was
in
--
in
one
of
the
--
the
groups
that
would
offer
one
--
entitle
to
some
--
some
relief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
director
says
--
the
director
said,
“well
now
i
--
i
just
decided
he's
not
entitled
to
relief.
that's
--
that's
all
there
is
to
it.”
now
are
the
courts
foreclosed
from
going
into
that
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
a
little
--
it
goes
a
little
far
because
i'm
not
saying
i
--
i
and
--
did
intend
he
would
--
he
would
say
i
willfully
disobey
the
law.
i
willfully
refuse
to
violate
the
law.
he
merely
says
on
these
facts
which
we
--
we
say
in
the
hypothetical
case
are
clearly
placed
this
man
within
a
--
within
one
of
those
groups.
on
these
facts,
i
determine
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
relief.
not
eligible
for
relief.
i
just
like
to
know
what
the
position
of
the
government
is
as
to
a
situation
of
that
kind.
does
the
man
have
judicial
review
or
does
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
--
you've
nodded
your
head
as
though
you
agreed.
i
just
wonder
if
you
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
fillman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may
have
--
you
may
have
a
few
minutes
to
sum
up
your
argument
there.
it
takes
amount
of
time
with
the
other
side
you
may
answer
if
you
wish
for
a
few
minutes.
