you're
not

more,
are
you?
justice

black
who
asked
him
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
housing
inspector
who
makes
--
wants
to
make
this
search?
justice

black
was
the
ordinance
construed
as
allowing
anyone
to
come
in
besides
the

justice

black
has
there
been
any
challenge
to
the
ordinance
to
its
application
insofar
as
some
person
other
than
the
housing
inspector
made
the
entry?
the
ordinance
says
the
housing
inspector.
justice

black
has
it
been
construed
by
the
city,
i
mean,
that
others
besides
the
housing
inspector
(voice

--
justice
hugo

black
(voice

construe
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
probably,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
court
held
that
others
beside
the
housing
inspector
could
go
in
under
authority
of
this
ordinance,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
evidence
that
the
housing
inspector
himself
ever
went
into
the
house?
justice

does
your
court
hold
that?

u.s.
what?
justice
hugo

what
page
did
you
say,
337?
justice

did
the
customer

try
cases
like
that
on
habeas

or
you
might
not
know
or
know
how?
justice

maybe
its
(inaudible)
but
while
the
case
is
pending
where
the
charge
is
made.
it's
rather
unusual,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo

black
is
the
entire
ordinance
here?
justice
hugo

black
(voice

justice

i
understood
you
are
referring
to
some
other
parts
of

justice

black
is
that
little
book
available
for
us?
justice
hugo

black
i
don't
know
if
we
need
it,
but
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
all
that
--
does
all
that
answer
apply
to
whether
a
search
is
reasonable
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
were
arguing
it
then
on
the
basis
of
the
reasonableness.
are
you
to
judge
the
reasonableness
of
the
search?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
necessity
for
searches?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
say
it's
never
been
considered
as
one
under
it
or
that
it's
just
not
been
tested,
it's
that
they
accepted
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
the
purpose,
i
suppose,
is
to
keep
your
privacy
whether
--
whether
you
live
on
a
whole
community
or
another
community
or
whatever
the
house.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
it
has,
depending
on
who
it
is.
you're
saying
that
an
inspector,
for
certain
purposes,
can
go
in
without
it
being
unreasonable
where
an
officer
who
is
searching
for
criminals,
it
would
be
unreasonable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
just
went
and
broke
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
inspector
just
went
and
broke
in,
would
you
say
that
because
he
was
an
inspector
and
they
needed
inspection
that
justified
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know,
but
i
was
testing
your
argument
as
to
the
judging
it
by
the
purpose
for
which
he
goes
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
--
all
searches
are
for
the
protection
of
the
people
perhaps
in
--
in
the
sense
that
they're
going
to
do
there
to
try
to
catch
criminals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
one
--
one
can
agree
with
you
fully
on
that
idea
and
still
not
have
to
go
to
the
next
step
to
say
that
because
of
that
purpose,
they
can
go
in
without
any
--
whatever,
supposedly,
the
safeguard
of
a
--
of
a
search
warrant
issued
by
a
magistrate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
--
that's
always
[laughs]
true.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
they
want
to
break
in
or
get
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know,
i
know.
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
about
these
officers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
there's
a
little
difference
on
whether
it
was
new
or
old,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
accept
that
as
entirely
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
the
provisions
of
the
constitution,
i
suppose,
that
put
some
period
curve
on
the
activities
of
officials
grow
on
the
assumption,
is
it
not,
that
they
are
honest
officials?
they
won't
do
anything
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
about
the
sanitary
officers
because
i
--
several
times
it's
been
mentioned
that
they
might
be
given
--
that
they
are
just
sanitary
officers
not
police
officers.
do
the
most
of
the
cities
provide
that
they
shall
have
police
jurisdiction
to
make
arrest,
if
they
see
a
crime,
an
offense?
justice

black
(voice

about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
--
that
the
city
or
the
laws
don't
usually
provide
that
the
sanitary
officers
shall
have
police
jurisdiction
when
they
wish
to
exercise
it
to
make
arrest?
justice

black
can
sanitary
officer
make
an
arrest
(voice

justice
hugo

--
for
violating
the
sanitary

justice

it's
correct,
isn't
it?
it's
a
correct
illustration,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo

what
i
say
though
--
i

what
i

is
it

it

you

are

they
are
very
helpful.
i
like
to
have
them.
i
like
to
know
who
they
are
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

black
but
my
questions
are
not
directed
at
that.
i
--
i
think
it's
a
very
reasonable
thing
to
have
health
inspection,
sanitary
inspection,
fire
inspection,
building
inspection,
but
the
question
i
asked
was
on
the
basis
of
the
reasonableness
of
how
they
get
in.
i
think
it
gets
down
to
that.
and
you
justified,
which
maybe
right,
largely
by
the
necessity
to
have
them
quit
and
periodically
in
the
times
when
they
get
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
asked
the
question
which
seemed
a
little
misunderstood,
noticing
it
was
the
housing
inspector
and
i
had
thought
maybe
that
was
an
indication,
it
was
recognized
that
this
was
a
rather
serious
thing
and
one
that
you'd
only
--
a
duty
that
you'd
only
entrust
to
your
real
head
of
the
housing
inspection
department.
justice

the

justice

well,
as
i
understood
you
to
be
arguing
that
the
evidence
shows
the
house
was
cleaned,
therefore,
it
didn't
need
inspection.
i
don't
--
i
don't
suppose
that's
was
what
the
case
has
cited
on
by
the
court
was.
i
thought
they've
decided
that
your
ordinance
--
the
reason
they
could
raise
it
by
habeas
corpus
was
that
your
ordinance
was
unconstitutional.
the
lower
court
and
the
upper
court
held
it
was
constitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
if
it
had
been
raised
on
habeas
corpus,
if
it
was
a
question
of
the
guilt

innocence
of
the
defendant.

to

you

you

was

this

what

immediately

justice

you
have
the

on

you
say

we
wish

which
reads
as

quote.
what's
that
taken
from?
justice

is
it
the
one
you
have
before
you
and
we're
reading
from
there?
justice
hugo

black
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
what
comes
immediately
before
these
quotations
you
have
on
page
42
in
that
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i
thought
you
had
it
before
you
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
think
mr.
--
i
think
mr.
rhyne
said
that
no
one
of
them
directly
raised
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
--
i
have
the
brief
before
me
and
i
see
that
there's
more
quoted
and
it
seem
to
be
quoted
from
what
you
have
in
your
record.
that
brief
does
say
“in
conclusion,
we
wish
to
cite
to
the
court
the
wolf
versus
colorado,
the
briefs
that
followed.
arbitrary
intrusion
of
privacy
by
the
police
is
prohibited
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth

justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
that
was
a
quote.
i
didn't
know
that.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
the
brief
that
was
filed
with
the
court
that
wrote
the
opinion
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
referring
to?
justice
hugo

black
court
of
common
pleas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
see
that
it
refers
but
four
times
to
the
constitutions.
and
also,
it
refers
to
the
due
process
clause
as
we
read
from
it
the
information
of
wolf.
what
--
what
other
constitutions
could
he
be
referring
to
except
to
state
in
the
federal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
has
brief
submitted
to
the
court
here
in
which
he
said,
cited
to
the
court
the
wolf
versus
colorado
saying
an
arbitrary
intrusion
prohibited
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
before
the
trial
court
has
wrote
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
also
goes
on
to
say
prior
to
the
laws,
that
is
the
constitution
and
they
overstepped
the
bounds
of
reasons
and
they
tried
to
be
sunray.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
--
if
you
are
correct
however,
that
is
being
raised
in
the
brief,
i
assume
that
the
fact
that
this
court,
i
don't
mean
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
is
raised
in
the
brief
to
the
court.
i
assume
that
the
fact
that
the
court
didn't
pass
on
it
specifically,
wouldn't
eventually
raise
it
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
but
suppose
you
had
presented
15
times
question
of
the
due
process
clause
and
the
court
decided
he
wouldn't
put
it
in
his
judgment.
would
that
affect
your
right
to
appeal
and
raise
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
he
raises
that.
i
understand
he
says
you
didn't
sufficiently
raise
it,
not
that
the
court
was
--
you
do
compel
to
show
in
the
court's
judgment
that
if
passed
on
it
on
--
and
that
it
is
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
they
couldn't
keep
this
court
from
deciding
the
constitutionality
of
--
of
the
question
if
it
was
raised
properly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
simply
by
leading
it
out
the
judgment.
