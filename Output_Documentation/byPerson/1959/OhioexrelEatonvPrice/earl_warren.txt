you

asked

--he

down

chief

well,
what
testimony
did
they
rely
on
to
--
to
--
oh,
oh,
there
was
a

what
is

chief

i
know,
but
what
--
what
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
that
point,
mr.
furman,
i
suppose
that
if
they
sent
the
sheriff
instead
of
the
housing
inspector,
you
--
you
wouldn't
object
to
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
deputy
sherif
and
--
and
not
the
sherif
himself,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
want
to--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we
want
to
be
realistic
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

realistic,
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
they
say
--
when
the
statute
says
the
sheriff,
i
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
these
deputies,
doesn't
it.
and
if
it
says
the
housing
inspector,
i
suppose
be
--
as
deputies,
it
--
they
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
would
perform
a
function.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
only
question
is,
here,
were
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
establish
that
this
were
housing
inspector,
inspectors
either
the
principal
or
deputies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
not
disputed
in
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rhyne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
no
constitutional
question
raised
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
the
--
the
use
of
the
wolf
case,
wolf
versus
colorado
by
the
defendant
below
indicates
sufficiently
clear
to
the
--
to
the
court
what
the
--
what
the
defendant
had
in
mind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
you
know,
sometimes,
sometimes,
we
don't
always
agree
here
whether
it's
the
fourth
or
the
--
or
the
fourteenth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
would
seem
--
seem
to
me
that
that
would
--
that
that
would
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
fairly
well.
and
--
and
furthermore,
didn't
the
brief
of
the
--
of
the
civil
liberties
union
raise
that
issue
specifically,
the
question
of
the
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
was
on
the
telephone,
wasn't
it?
that
wasn't
at
his
house
when
they
came
there
to
--
to
get
in,
was
it?
wasn't
that
on
the
telephone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
what
you
just
pointed
out
to
us,
that
was
on
the
telephone,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
let's
just
read
it,
mr.
rhyne
and
--
and
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wait
a
minute.
now,
let's
read
the
whole
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
“then
the
second
time,
the
fellow
came
out,
he
entered
the
same
way.
he
came
up
like
that.
and
then
he
called
me
on
the
telephone,
wanted
to
know
if
he
could
come
to
my
house
and
inspect
the
inside
of
the
house.
i
said,
“who
are
you,
anyway?”
he
said,
“i'm
the
building
inspector
or
the
housing
inspector.”
and
he
said,
“well,
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
see
what
right
that
you've
got
coming
into
my
house.”
now,
doesn't
that
say
that
it
was
on
the
telephone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
does
that
--
does
what
you
have
read,
as
a
matter
of
proof,
indicate
that
the
man
who
came
there
were
housing
inspectors?
now,
how
does
that
--
how
does
that
prove
that,
mr.
rhyne?
chief
justice
earl
warren
historically,
he's
telling
me
about
what
he
would
object
to,
what
he
wouldn't
object
to
and
why
he
--
he
would
object
to
one
and
wouldn't
object
to
the
other,
but
--
but
this
doesn't,
what
you've
just
read,
doesn't
--
doesn't
indicate
in
anyway
that
these
men
who
actually
came
to
his
house
and
demanded
admittance
were
housing
inspectors
or
any
kind
of
inspectors.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
hadn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
didn't
presume
that
they
were
housing
inspectors
because
he
says
in
his
testimony
he
didn't
know.
and
he's
--
that's
the
only
testimony
that's
in
the
case.
so
how
can
you
say
that
everybody
is
talking
about
housing
inspectors?
there
weren't
any
other
witnesses
expect
this
one
man.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
make
it
as
a
finding
of
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
is
that
a
finding
of
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
show
it
was
a
housing
inspector?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
what
language
in
the
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
different
if
we
--
if
we
were
to
take
all
the
testimonies.
maybe
that's
true,
but
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
point
out
what
you
--
what
you
were
relying
on
specifically.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
rhyne,
i'm
just
curios
about
it.
were
they
have
any
trial
in
police
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understood,
they
--
they
fixed
bail
at
a
thousand
dollars.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
man
couldn't
make
the
bail,
so
he
had
to
go
to
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thousand
dollars
isn't
always
too
easy
to
make
for
the
average
working
man.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rhyne,
isn't
there
--
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
this
ordinance
and
the
maryland
ordinance,
it's
one
of
substance
in
--
in
the
maryland
ordinance,
they
require
that
he
must
have
reasons
to
believe.
there
must
be
some
cause
for
his
going
in
there.
in
this
--
under
this
ordinance,
as
i
--
as
i
read
it,
it
doesn't
require
that
he
have
any
reason
to
believe
at
all,
he
just
--
he
just
do
as
he's
--
as
he
apparently
did
here
in
this
case,
say,
“i
wanted
--
i
want
to
come
in,”
and
the
man
says,
“why
do
you
want
to
come
in
for?”
“well,
i
got
a
right
to
come
in,”
and
--
and
relying
on
the
testimony
that
was
read
to
us
here
today,
but
isn't
that
a
rather
important
distinction
between
those
two
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
of
course,
in
that
--
in
that
case,
there
was
evidence
and
to
show
cause
and
there
was
this
pile
of
debris
out
there
and
there
were
the
rodents
running
around
it
in
the
trail
leading
to
the
--
to
the
house.
and
there
was
--
there
was
a
reason
for
the
health
inspector
to
believe
that
in
all
probability,
he
would
find
unsanitary
conditions
in
there,
but
both
under
--
under
the
ordinance,
this
ordinance
and
in
accordance
with
the
testimony
that
was
read
to
us,
the
inspector
had
no
cause
to
come
in
there
that
--
that
he
made
known,
he
--
or
that
we
know
about,
he
just
said,
“i
want
to
come
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
--
because
i
got
a
right
to
come
in.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
difference
there?
they
are
very
different
questions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
that
could
happen
if
a
warrant
was
issued,
what
would
prevent
the
same
thing
from
happening
when
he
goes
in
there
without
a
warrant
and
he
sees
these
same
things?
why
couldn't
he
then
go
to
the
police
and
turn
it
over
to
them?
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
entirely
beside
the
point.
a
man
can
see
other
evidence
of
crime
just
as
well
whether
he
has
a
warrant
or
whether
he
doesn't
have
a
warrant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duffy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
--
just
walking
through
a
home,
for
instance,
inspect
the
electrical
equipment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
are
other
things
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
are
other
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
are
other
things
that
go
into
the
construction
of
the
building,
are
there
not,
that
--
that
have
to
do
with
the
safety
of
electrical
fixtures
and
--
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
might
be
going
into
--
you
might
be
going
into
the
closets
where
the
--
where
the
fuses
are
or
up
in
the
--
up
in
the
loft
where
the
--
where
the
connections
are
made
in
order
to
see
whether
there's
fire
or
danger
in
that.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
it
shouldn't
be
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
asked
you
if
it
is
quite
as
simple
as
you
have
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
householder
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
householder
only
tried
to
limit
them
to
that,
and
they
said,
“no,
we
want
--
we
want
to
see
more
than
this.
we
want
to
see
your
connections
here.
we
want
to
go
into
your
loft.
we
want
to
go
into
these
closets
where
the
--
where
the
fuses
are
and
so
forth.”
suppose
they
said
you
--
you
can't
do
that
because
that's
a
part
of
your
building
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
building
code,
would
they
have
a
right
to
do
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
penalty
if
he
doesn't
under
your
tax
laws?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
they
put
it,
but
they
don't
force
their
way
in
or
they
don't
arrest
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
put
an
arbitrary
assessment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
wants
to
take
that
instead
of
searching,
as
he
can.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
doesn't
--
but
it
doesn't
put
him
in
jail
as
you
can
this
man.
that's
the
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
blakely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
other
quotation
from
the
reply
brief
was
in
the
trial
court
also.
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed,
mr.
furman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
did
raise
a
state
constitutional
question
too,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
you
--
both
of
them
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
would
you
give
us
that
third
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
you
sit
down?
