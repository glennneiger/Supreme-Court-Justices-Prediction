mr.
greene
chandler
furman
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
--
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
present
case
arises
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
on
an
alleged
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
arose
from
the
alleged
violation
of
a
dayton
municipal
ordinance
for
housing
inspectors.
it's
brought
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
man
--
and
i
might
say
in
the
beginning
that
the
name
eaton
is
misleading.
the
real
appellant
is
earl
taylor.
mr.
eaton
was
the
first
of
a
number
of
attorneys
in
this
case,
and
he
is
no
longer
our
counsel
or
connected
with
the
case.
so
the
actual
appellant
is
mr.
taylor.
the
trial
court
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
a
court
of
common
pleas
of
dayton,
ohio.
it
granted
the
writ
on
constitutional
ground.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
ohio.
i
forget
the
number
of
it,
one
sitting
there
in
dayton,
and
was
reversed
by
2-to-1
vote,
and
that
opinion
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
from
that
point,
application
of
appeal
was
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
in
the
time
that
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
june
the
8th,
1959,
the
court,
i
believe,
acted
in
an
unprecedented
manner.
the
court
admits
it
rendered
three
memorandum
opinions.
it
was
the
opinion
of
four
of
the
justices,
that
this
case
was
absolutely
controlled
by
the
case
recently
decided
in
may
of
frank
versus
maryland.
i'm
sure
that
the
court
is
familiar
with
this
case,
and
the
frank
versus
maryland
case
and
--
and
other
cases
arising
on
this
type
of
thing.
that,
as
i
say,
is
unusual.
it's
a
little
disconcerting
because
it
means
i've
got
to
persuade
one
of
you,
gentlemen,
that
you're
wrong,
and
that
is
--
is
something
to
undertake.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
yes,
sir.
i
[laughs]
guess
so.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
penance
would
be
but
i
hope
at
least
to
get
five
of
you,
gentlemen.
that
is
an
absolute
minimum
necessity
and
that
means
that
one
of
the
four
must
change
his
mind.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
no,
sir.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
it
does
have
this
advantage
though
as
i
see
it.
one
of
the
most
frustrating
things
that
i
found
in
law
is
to
prepare
a
case
and
to
think
you're
arguing
it
correctly,
and
the
court
apparently
is
attentive,
and
then
it
goes
off
and
decides
a
case
on
some
other
ground.
in
view
of
these
memorandums,
i
know
that
we
must
face
the
case
of
frank
versus
maryland
and
distinguish
between
that
case
and
the
present
case
goes
under
the
name
of
eaton,
ohio
ex
rel.
eaton
versus
price,
chief
of
police.
i
am
happy
to
tell
the
court
that,
at
least
in
my
opinion,
the
two
cases
can
be
distinguished
in
three
ways.
on
the
facts
of
the
case
and
many
cases
that
are
similar,
differ
in
facts,
and
the
facts
are
after
all
the
important
thing
that
we
try
to
find
out
what
are
on
the
dayton
ordinance
as
compared
to
the
baltimore
ordinance
on
the
penalty
of
the
dayton
ordinance
and
of
the
baltimore
ordinance.
the
--
the
facts
of
this,
in
the
--
in
the
dayton
case,
earl
taylor
was
born
in
state
of
ohio,
from
what
i
can
gather
from
the
record.
i
might
say
that
i
don't
know
him.
he
was
admitted
to
the
plumbers
union
in
dayton,
ohio
in
1914.
like
a
great
many
people,
his
home
is
in
his
wife's
name
but
he
paid
some
of
the
cost
of
it,
and
they
live
in
a
street
in
the
city
of
dayton.
it's
a
small
four-room
house,
i
believe.
he
has
never
had
any
criminal
record.
and
the
property,
according
to
him,
is
in
excellent
condition.
in
1957,
a
man
came
there
and
he
said
he
want
to
go
in
his
house.
he
asked
him
why
and
the
man
couldn't
tell
it.
he
said
the
law
let
him
come
in.
he
asked
him
if
--
if
he
was
asked
in
the
trial
court
in
the
case
on
habeas
corpus
if
he
had
anything
and
he
said,
“yes.”
he
had
a
sheet
of
pad,
a
yellow
paper
like
that
chap
over
there,
the
fellow
over
there.
i
take
it's
a
legal
pad
and
that's
what
he
had.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
he
did
not
at
that
time.
they
call
on
him
three
times.
it
was
in
the
morning.
and
on
the
second
time,
i
think
two
men
came,
and
on
the
third
time,
i
think
two
men
came,
and
one
of
them
pulled
a
card
out
of
his
hip
pocket
according
to
the
testimony.
and
--
but
none
of
them
told
him
why
they
wanted
to
get
in
the
house.
now,
the
testimony
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
well,
i
think
it
was
a
minimal
compliance,
if
a
compliance.
i
don't
have
to
look
that
up
but
you'll
find
his
testimony
in
the
record.
i
can
read
this
part.
they
were
there
on
three
occasions.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that's
on
page
20
of
the
transcript.
and
what
happened?
well,
the
first
time
they
came
there,
they
just
came
and
said
they
wanted
to
come
in
the
house
and
go
through
the
house
and
inspect
the
inside
of
the
house.
they
didn't
have
any
credentials
or
nothing.
and
that
was
a
young
fellow,
i
don't
know
his
name.
only
thing
he
had
was
just
a
piece
of
paper,
and
he
wanted
to
go
through
the
house
and
inspect
the
house.
i
said,
“you
have
nothing
to
show
me,
you've
got
a
right
to
go
through
my
house.”
he
said,
“we
don't
have
to
have
according
to
the
law
passed
four
years
ago.”
i
said,
“that
don't
show
me
that
you've
got
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
on
page
21.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
now,
i
began
at
the
bottom
of
20
and
reading
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
--
at
the
top
of
21,
your
honor.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
“that
don't
show
me
that
you've
got
anything
in
there,
you
want
for
an
inspection.”
and
further,
“i
don't
have
nothing
in
my
house
that
has
to
be
inspected.”
and
he
said,
“well,
you
know
according
to
this
ordinance,
we
got
a
right
to
go
through
your
house
and
inspect
your
house.”
i
said,
“no,
i
don't
think
you
have
unless
you
got
a
search
warrant.”
did
they
have
a
search
warrant?
no,
they
didn't.
only
thing
he
had
was
a
piece
of
yellow
paper
tablet
like
that
gentleman
got
over
there.
so
he
stood
there
and
argued.
and
i
said,
“until
you
get
something
to
show
me
that
you've
got
a
right
to
come
in
my
house
for
inspection
or
what
you
want
to
inspect
in
my
house.”
i
said,
“you
cannot
come
in.”
he
says,
“if
that's
the
way
you
feel
about
it,
we'll
have
to
leave
it
up
to
the
housing
inspectors.”
i
don't
know
who
this
man
was,
if
he
is
really
the
housing
inspector,
perhaps
he
was
one,
perhaps
he
wasn't.
all
i
know
is
what's
here.
i
guess
he
meant
down
to
the
office,
that
was
some
young
fellow.
then,
the
second
time
the
fellow
came
out.
he
entered
the
same
way,
came
up
like
that
and
then
call
me
on
the
telephone
wondering
if
he
could
come
to
my
house
and
inspect
the
inside.
i
said,
“who
are
you,
anyway?”
he
said,
“i'm
the
building
inspector
or
the
housing
inspector.”
and
he
said,
“well,
i
don't
see
what
rights
you've
got
coming
into
my
house
until
you
show
me
in
writing
or
some
kind
of
facts
that
you've
got
a
right
to
come
into
house
and
inspect
the
house.
i
will
not
let
you
in.”
and
i
said
furthermore,
“i
know
the
building
inspectors.”
i
remember
this
man,
the
union
plumber.
and
i
know
the
plumbing
inspectors
and
the
electric
inspectors
and
all
the
rest
of
them.
i
said,
“i
worked
at
this
business
and
i
come
in
contact
with
them
off
and
on
and
as
far
as
you
coming
in,”
i
said,
“you
can't
come
in.”
he
said,
“if
i
bring
the
inspectors
out
with
me,
could
i
come
in?”
i
said,
“no,
you
can't
come
in
but
i'll
let
the
other
inspectors
come
in
if
they
want
to
come
in,
but
you
can't
come
in.”
now,
i
don't
--
the
man,
as
i
say,
he
has
been
a
plumber
a
long
time,
maybe
he
was
acting
a
little
unusual.
the
question
is
was
he
acting
as
the
man
that
has
a
right
to
act
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
“do
you
know
who
that
was?”
“i
don't
know
anymore
than
you
do.
i
don't
know
who
he
was.
he
was
just
some
young
fellow.”
and
then
he
goes
on,
on
page
22
to
cut
it
a
little
short,
the
last
time
they
came
there,
a
colored
fellow
and
a
white
fellow,
and
they
came
to
the
door
and
i
talked
them
out
and
he
said,
“mr.
taylor?”
i
said,
“yes,
sir.”
he
showed
me
like
a
picture.
he
had
a
picture
of
a
piece
of
paper,
on
a
piece
of
paper,
and
he
held
it
out
in
a
hand
and
stuck
it
back
in
his
pocket.
he
said,
“the
housing
inspector
wanted
to
inspect
your
house.”
i
said,
“what
do
you
have
in
there
that
you
want
to
inspect?”
i
said,
“i
have
nothing
in
my
house
for
inspection.”
he
said,
“we
have
a
right
to
come
in
your
house,
go
through
your
house
and
inspect
the
whole
inside
of
your
house.”
i
said,
“you
have
nothing
wrote
down
on
paper.
you
don't
have
a
thing
to
show
me.
you
are
going
to
come
in
there
to
inspect
anything.
and
as
far
as
that
goes,
you
aren't
coming
in
unless
you
have
a
search
warrant
to
get
in.”
did
he
have
a
search
warrant?
no,
sir.
did
you
ever
come
back
without
a
search
--
did
they
ever
come
back
without
a
search
warrant?
and
then
it
goes
on
that.
he
--
he
expressed
a
willingness
to
let
other
types
of
inspectors
that
he
knew
but
these
men
were
there
and
then
i'm
going
to
tell
him
why
they
wanted
to
come
in,
and
he
thought
that
was
going
a
little
too
far.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
it
may
be.
i
have
several
but
i
don't
know
whether
that
order
let
me
in
your
house,
your
honor,
or
not.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
[laughs]
yes,
it
is
but
i
mean
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
well,
i
don't
know
the
statute
was
complied,
but
we
are
putting
it
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
yes.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
now,
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
there's
an
interesting
fact
and
that
is,
there
was
only
one
witness.
the
witness
was
earl
taylor.
his
testimony
is
uncontroverted.
who
these
people
were,
were
never
shown
anything
else.
i
think,
therefore,
we
must
accept
that
everything
mr.
taylor
said
was
true.
he
said
his
house
is
in
first
class
condition
in
every
particular.
he
says
he's
a
plumber.
he
knows
it.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
house.
these
people
couldn't
tell
him
why
they
wanted
to
come
in
and
that's
why
they
didn't
get
in.
they
have
that
--
they
asked
him
about
drinking
and
disturbances
and
all
that,
and
his
testimony
is
a
little
amusing.
he
says,
“you
have
had
wild
parties
down
there?”
he
says,
“absolutely
not.
i'd
get
killed
if
i
did.”
i
think
he
was
afraid
of
his
wife,
but
that's
not
unusual.
that
seems
the
inference
i
get
out
of
it.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
no
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
--
on
examination.
on
examination
at
the
--
at
the
trial
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
he
was
asked
if
he
had
any
wild
parties
of
excess
or
disturbance
of
any
kind.
he
said,
“no.”
he
said
his
house
was
in
first
class
condition
in
every
particular.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
his
attorney
at
that
time,
mr.
eaton.
there's
--
when
you
consider
the
facts,
in
other
words,
we
must
assume
this
house
is
first
class
in
every
particular.
the
evidence
uncontroverted
shows
that
there
was
no
reason
given
at
any
time
for
wanting
to
inspect
the
house.
there
was
no
warrant.
we
should
consider
the
difference
between
this
house
and
the
house
of
mr.
frank,
in
the
case
frank
versus
maryland.
in
other
words,
we
have
the
--
the
opinion
of
justice
whittaker,
which
is
very
short
in
that
case.
it
says
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment
prohibiting
unreasonable
searches
applied
to
the
states
through
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
cites
wolf
versus
colorado.
i
understand
the
court's
opinion
to
adhere
fully
to
that
principle
and
being
convinced
that
the
health
inspectors
request
for
permission.
now,
this
was
a
health
inspector
and
not
a
housing
inspector.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
a
housing
inspector
does.
at
least,
they
apparently
didn't
know.
in
the
premises
in
midday
for
the
whole
purpose
of
attempting
to
locate
the
habitat
of
disease
carrying
rodents
known
to
be
somewhere
in
the
immediate
area
was
not
a
request
for
permission
to
make
that,
and
the
code
procedures
followed
did
not
amount
to
enforcement
of
an
unreasonable
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
i
believe
i
understand
mr.
whittaker
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
this
case
and
the
frank
case
because
there
was,
let's
say,
no
hot
pursuit
of
rodents
in
this
case.
as
far
i
can
see,
there
was
really
no
hot
pursuit
of
anything
because
nobody
knew
what
they
wanted
to
find
out.
in
the
--
in
the
majority
opinion
of
that
case
of
frank
versus
maryland,
we
have
--
it
was
rendered
for
the
court
by
mr
frankfurter,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
excuse
me.
he
cites
in
that
case,
“whenever
the
commissioner
of
health
shall
have
caused
to
suspect
that
a
nuisance
exist
in
any
house,
cellar
or
enclosure,
he
may
demand
entry
therein
in
the
daytime
and
if
the
owner
or
occupier
shall
refuse
or
delay
to
open
the
same
and
admit
free
examination,
he
shall
forfeit
--
forfeit
and
pay
for
each
sum
the
refusal
of
$20.”
we
now
read
the
ordinance
of
dayton
that
section
(a),
you'll
find
it
on
the
transcript
at
page
45.
i
hate
to
read
but
i
don't
know
how
else
we
can
cover
it,
“the
housing
inspector
is
hereby
authorized
and
directed
to
make
inspections
to
determine
the
condition
of
the
dwellings,
units,
rooming
houses,
rooming
units
located
in
the
city
of
dayton
in
order
to
preserve
the
safety
of
the
occupants
and
the
general
health
and
welfare
and
great
many
other
things.
for
the
purpose
of
making
such
inspections
and
upon
showing
appropriate
identification,
the
housing
inspector
is
hereby
authorized
to
enter,
examine

units
and
premises.
the
owner
or
occupant
of
every
dwelling
unit,
rooming
house
therefore
shall
give
--
thereof
shall
give
the
housing
inspector
free
access
to
such
dwelling,”
and
it
goes
on.
in
other
words,
the
great
difference
is
that
the
commissioner
of
health
shall
have
cause
to
suspect
that
a
nuisance
exist
in
any
house
or
cellar.
in
the
dayton
ordinance,
there
is
no
necessity.
there
is
no
reason.
he
can
go
in
at
any
reasonable
hour.
he
is
limited
to
daytime.
well,
a
reasonable
might
be
7:30
at
night
because
that's
off
when
the
man
is
at
home.
these
all
occurred
in
the
daytime.
they
call
in
the
morning.
mr.
taylor
was
there.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
he
was
--
i
don't
think
it
was
the
housing
inspector
himself.
there
had
several
different
men
came
out,
if
you
read
the
testimony,
your
honor.
now,
the
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that
would
seem
to
be
the
housing
--
that
--
that
would
seem
to
be
the
opinion,
your
honor.
all
i
know
is
what's
in
the
transcript.
and
honestly,
it's
spotty
in
parts
like
most
habeas
corpus
things.
the
last
point
is
that
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
the
trial
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
yes.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
the
only
witness
was
the
appellant,
earl
taylor.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
everything
he
said
was
the
truth.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
and
i
don't
think
it
states
he
didn't
know
who
these
people
were.
that's
what
he
said
so.
i
don't
know
whether
they're
housing
inspectors
or
who
they
were.
i
might
suspect
there
were,
perhaps,
deputies
of
the
housing
inspector
because
i
don't
think
the
housing
inspector
makes
all
of
this
himself.
i
don't
know.
if
you
ask
me
what
i
know,
the
evidence
doesn't
show
it.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
got
into
this
case
in
january,
and
all
i
know
was
what
i've
been
able
to
find
because
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that's
what
it
said.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
as
far
as
i
know--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
--
it
has
not.
i
don't
think
there's
been
another
--
there
was
another
case
in
ohio
that
is
mentioned.
it
was
not
appealed
and
it
differed
from
this
case,
and
that
it
was
an
apartment
and
not
a
home.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
at
least,
i
assume
it
did
because
three
men
apparently,
two
at
one
time
and
one
man
by
himself
was
described
as
a
young
fellow
with
a
pad
of
yellow
paper.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
no,
sir,
as
far
as
i
can
read.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
yes,
sir.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
yes.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
well,
the
law
says
there's
a
housing
inspector.
the
court
of
--
the
court
of
common
pleas
says
housing
inspectors.
i
--
i
don't
imagine,
i
don't
know,
maybe
some
cause
or
facts
are
not
here
and
were
limited
to
the
record
as
the
record
exist.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
oh,
about
250,000.
i've
never
been
in
dayton.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
no.
apparently,
they
had
--
three
tried
to
get
into
this
house,
your
honor.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
well,
as
i
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
oh,
you
mean
--
well,
as
i
say
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
well,
the
court
does
say,
i
mean
the
ordinance
does
say
housing
inspector
and
the
judge
says
housing
inspectors.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
think
so.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
--
well,
i
read
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
--
as
i
read
the
ordinance,
it
means
just
one
housing
inspector
but
i
presume
that
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
it's
been
hearsay.
i
understand
that
they
had
a
block
up.
and
they
were
spread
over
the
country
like
a
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
--
cloud
of
locus,
but
i
don't
know.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
in
section
(a)
on
--
on
page
45,
it
says
the
housing,
capital
h,
inspector
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
--
capital
i,
is
hereby,
and
that
means
one
man.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
no,
sir,
the
court,
the
trial
court
refers
housing
inspectors
and
pluralized
them
and
makes
it
with
a
small
--
small
--
without
capitalization,
i
believe.
that's
what
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
well,
the
judge
found
one
finding
of
fact
and
the
other
courts
found
a
little
different.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
don't
think
on
that
point,
apparently
they
were
a
number.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
will
admit
this
that
for
practical
purposes,
there
were
a
number
of
housing
inspectors,
that's
clear.
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
only
one
qualified
in
the
ordinance.
now,
that
point
was
not
raised
so
far
as
i
can
find
below.
of
course,
the
pleadings
of
the
counsel,
all
the
way
through
stressed
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
act.
you'll
find
it
in
the
--
in
the
opening
statement
of
--
of
counsel.
you'll
find
that
the
judge
himself
--
“the
relator,”
i'm
reading
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
52.
“the
relator
refused
on
several
occasions
to
permit
housing
inspectors,
small
h
and
small
i,
to
enter
his
home
without
a
search
warrant,
although
he
is
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
this
is
the
transcript
of
record.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
it's
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
yes,
sir.
it's
the
opinion
not
the
--
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
ordinarily,
we
call
them
the
high
sheriff
doesn't
do
anything
except
he
often
has
a
lot
of
--
he's
hardly
ever
makes
a
risk,
the
sheriff's
papers.
but
apparently,
from
the
ordinance,
there
is
a
housing
inspector
and
if
your
honors
won't
believe
that
the
housing
inspector
must
do
it
personally,
i'll
be
delighted.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
[laughs]
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
think
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
they
have
deputies
unquestionable.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that's
true.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
the
deputy
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
think
that's
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
there
is
no
evidence
because
the
--
taylor
states
in
his
evidence
that
he
didn't
know
they
were.
now,
they
told
him
and
they
flash
something
out
of
packet
of
a
card
the
third
time
and
showed
it
to
them.
but
i
think
if
you
read
mr.
taylor's
testimony,
which
doesn't
cover
but
a
few
pages,
you
won't
find.
am
i
correct
in
that?
that
he
knew
who
these
people
were.
his
concluding
statement
was
that
“i
wouldn't
let
him
in
because
they
couldn't
tell
me
what
they
wanted
and
what
they're
going
to
do.”
now,
that's
the
record,
as
i
say,
i
--
i
was
not
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
it's
not
disputed.
every
word
of
the
record
is
true
because
there
is
only
one
witness
and
that's
the
appellant,
earl
taylor.
and
as
i
say,
we
raise
the
question
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
constitutionality
of
this
thing
and
the
opening
statement
of
counsel
and
the
judge,
and
we
have
that.
now,
there
are
number
of
cases
that
i
could
cite,
but
my
time
is
passing
and
i
must
yield
to
my
colleague.
but
i
--
there's
one
case
particular
that
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
i
haven't
argued
much
this
point.
it's
gibbs
versus
burke,
warden
of
the
penitentiary,
337
u.s.
773.
we
did
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
--
not
cite
that.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
no,
sir.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
773.
it
says
two
procedural
points
require
but
brief
attention.
the
federal
question
was
adequately
if
inarticulate
--
inartistically
raised
in
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
we
--
we
reconsider
insignificant
under
these
circumstances
the
fact
that
petitioners
cited
the
sixth
rather
than
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
meticulous
insistence
upon
the
regularity
in
procedural
allegations
is
foreign
to
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
337,
773.
and
we
have
the
same
problems
in
the
open.
if
your
honor
will
excuse
me
i
think
i
have
distinguished
those
cases
and
i
believe
(inaudible)
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
black,
during
the
lunch
and
recess,
i've
tried
to
clarify
the
question
that
you
asked
me.
if
i
may
call
your
attention
to
the
note
on
page
four
of
the
brief,
the
appellant
substitute
brief.
it
is
stated,
“the
existence
of
a
substantial
federal
question
was
raised
by
counsel
in
all
courts
below
and
in
briefs
the
filed
with
all
such
courts.
such
briefs
do
not
appear
in
the
transcript
of
record,
but
have
been
certified
and
filed
with
the
court.
now,
the
clerk
assures
me
that
those
briefs
that
we
had
certified
and
filed
here
are
available
and
that
--
i
know
that
i'm
repeating
myself.
that
i
explain
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
the
language
i
read
to
you,
the
court,
particularly
to
your
honor
before
lunch,
namely
the
replied
brief
of
the
respondent,
namely
the
--
earl
taylor
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
on
page
43
of
the
appendix.
i
don't
know
how
much
more
explicit
the
language
could
be,
your
honor.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
yes,
your
honor.
well,
they
are
available
and
we
thank
your
honor
for
raising
the
questions
that
was
not
explicit
as
it
should
have
or
could
have
been.
furthermore,
i
think
as
to
the
reason
of
the
constitutional
question,
it
might
be
well
to
refer
to
mr.
eaton's
opening
statement
found
on
page
17
of
the
record.
the
second
paragraph,
the
first
one
from
the
top
of
the
page
rather.
i
mentioned
that
the
word
“we”.
“we
are
here
this
morning
on
the
question
of
the
merits
of
the
habeas
corpus
petition
and
of
course,
it
is
a
contention
of
the
defendant,
mr.
earl
taylor,
that
the
affidavit
filed
against
him
does
not
contain
for
a
sufficient
to
constitute
a
criminal
charge
and
that
the
ordinance
so
far
as
it
permits
the
entry
of
these
inspectors
into
his
private
home
without
a
search
warrant
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
with
that
language
before
the
court,
he
is
bound
to
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
federal
constitution.
i
don't
see
how
that
conclusion
could
be
avoided
because
it's
inescapable.
and
to
indicate
that
the
court
was
aware
of
this
question,
i
referred
to
page
32
of
the
record
and
this
is
a
comment
of
the
trial
court,
judge
thomas.
and
it's
the
second
and
third
paragraph
from
the
top.
they
court,
“that
is
true,
mr.
duffy
however,
we
are
in
this
issue
concerned
with
the
major
issue
and
that
is
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
as
it
apply
--
as
it
applies
to
this
particular
case.
i
think
that
it
is
possibly
the
chief
issue
we
have
here
and
also
a
collateral
one.
i
believe
that
would
be
subject
to
this
inquiry
that
in
charge
--
that
is
the
charge
as
it
applies
to
this
gentleman.”
now,
his
personal
reasons
may
throw
us
all
for
our
cause
a
little
bit.
that
is
the
only
reason
i'm
commenting
upon
it
at
this
time.
i
think
such
we're
discussing
what
the
trial
court
had
to
say.
i'd
be
well
to
refer
to
remarks
of
judge
thomas
on
page
11
of
the
record.
this
is
the
second
paragraph
from
the
top.
“the
proponents
of
ordinances
which
provide
for
unlimited
number
of
inspections,”
i've
forgotten
which
one
of
your
honors
asked
me
about
how
many
inspections
could
be
held
and
that
is
my
authority
for
that
remark,
the
conclusion
of
judge
thomas
of
the
trial
court.
that's
in
the
--
“for
an
unlimited
number
of
inspections
of
private
homes
at
reasonable
hours,
contend
that
the
execution
of
this
ordinance
does
not
violate
the
right
to
privacy
in
homes,
provision
of
the
constitution.”
they
don't
see
what
else
the
trial
court
could
have
been
referring
to
other
than
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
could
clearly
have
that
in
mind,
although
he
didn't
use
the
words
as
i'm
using
them
here
now,
but
i
think
he
expressly
had
that
in
mind
when
he
used
this
language
here.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
as
the
search
and
seizures
provision
of
the
state
constitution
and
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
are
identical
as
that
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
(voice
overlap)
that
is
correct
except
for
two
words
and
in
passing
on
one
is,
he
may
have
confused
him
some,
but
--
and
not
separate
them
as
we
would
now
like
for
him
to
have
done,
but
i
think
the
fact
remains
that
even
though
he's
--
my
associate
said
in
the
gibbs
case,
he
may
have
done
it
inartistically,
but
it
was
done
nevertheless.
that's
the
position
of
the
appellant.
that's
the
position
of
counsel
and
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that
was
the
purpose
of
my
observation
mr.
justice
whittaker.
that
reference
was
made
to
both
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
like
provision
which
was
section
14,
article
1
of
the
ohio
constitution.
on
the
--
i
would
say
have
remarked
earlier
the
languages
are
identical
except
for
the
variation
of
two
words.
does
that
help
your
honor?
have
i
confused
you
further
attempting
to
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
grant
you
that,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
wish
to
appear
positions
that
captures
with
the
court,
but
once
counsel
has
it
raised
a
federal
question
properly.
you
know,
it's
out
of
his
reach
and
he
can't
tell
if
he's
honorable.
now,
you
will
rule
on
my
fourteenth
amendment
provision
which
i've
raised
in
urgent
and
in
persuade
but
i
think
all
of
us
had
been
in
trial
courts
realized
that
there's
only
so
far
been
going
urging
the
court
to
rule
a
certain
way.
and
i
think
his
reference
to
the
equal
protection
and
the
due
process
clause
and
in
his
brief
to
the
trial
court,
certainly,
made
that
court
aware
of
what
he
was
referring
to.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
the
court
of
common
pleas,
your
honor.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
don't
think
there
are
any
others
to
refer
to,
your
honor
and
is
supposed
unfortunate
that
he
didn't
specify
in
expressed
words
when
he
was
referring
to
the
--
to
article
--
to
section
14
of
article
1
of
the
ohio
constitution.
he
has
in
places
and
he
has
pointed
out
the
similarity
almost
identical
words,
but
there
is
an
intermixing
of
the
phraseology
in
his
comments
and
the
comments
of
the
court
too.
it's
most
unfortunate
but
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that
was
before
the
trial
court,
your
honor.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i'm
--
i'm
well
aware
of
--
of
that
intermixing
of
phraseology
there,
your
honor.
i
have
this
dangerous
signal,
that
time
is
almost
out
and
i
have
an
explanation
to
make
here
with
extreme
humility.
there
are
very
--
three
very
important
cases
that
counsel
intended
to
have
in
his
reply
brief
and
due
to
the
pressure
of
time
or
to
--
to
lapse
of
memory
or
because
--
i
don't
have
any
excuse,
they
will
omitted.
and
the
answer,
the
question
as
to
how
explicit
do
you
have
to
raise
a
constitutional
question
in
the
trial
court.
this
is
a
long
line
of
cases
and
it
distinguishes
primarily
the
principal
case
relied
upon
by
the
appellee,
namely
lynch
v.
new
york.
and
cases
wish
i
wish
to
cite,
well,
number
one,
st.
louis,
iron
mountain
&
southern
railway
company,
this
covered
243
u.s.
592.
i'll
repeat
st.
louis,
iron
mountain
&
southern
railway
company,
discovered
243
u.s.
592.
the
second
one
is
minnesota
v.
national
tea
company,
309
u.s.
551.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
309,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
551,
page
551.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that
is
indicated
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
because
it
was
not
expressed
enough
but
nevertheless,
it
did
not
affirm
for
the
reason
urged
by
the
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
--
the
appellant.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
--
that's
the
language
i
have
here.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
conclusive
on
this
court
though.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
--
we
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
that's
--
that's
why
we're
here
urging
that
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
be
affirmed.
but
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
that's
the
purpose
of
these
cases
i'm
citing
your
honor
that
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
think
it
did,
your
honor,
very
definitely.
yes
indeed.
but
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
well,
the
--
the
language
used
here
which
mr.
justice
whittaker
was
reading,
it
says
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that's
the
whole
basis
of
the
appellee's
position
as
we
honest
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
i
think
as
the
trial
judge
said
that
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
we
assert
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
that
--
that's
the
position
of
the
--
the
appellant
here
100%.
and
as
i
tried
to
explain
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
in
all
humility,
once
these
questions
are
raised
in
the
trial
court,
it's
beyond
counsel
to
determine
how
we
rule
it.
there
are
ways
we
would
like
to
affirm
the
rule
but
--
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
greene
chandler
furman
yes
sir,
williams
v.
kaiser,
323
u.s.
471.
i
--
and
the
purpose
in
citing
all
of
these
cases
is
to
show
that
the
constitutional,
the
federal
question
does
not
have
to
be
raised
in
precise
language.
thanks,
your
honor.
