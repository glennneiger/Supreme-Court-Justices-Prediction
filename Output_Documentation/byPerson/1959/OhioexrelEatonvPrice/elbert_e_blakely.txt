mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
we
should
get
back
to
fundamentals
here
at
some
point.
now,
this
case
reminds
me
of
a
conversation
i
had
with
an
all
time
practitioner
here
in
the
city.
i
told
him
that
my
client
in
dayton
was
arrested
and
jailed
because
a
housing
inspector
attempted
to
come
in
his
house
without
any
process
at
all.
and
he
said,
“well,
blakely,
i
thought
that
was
settled
with
king
john
and
the
baron
back
in
runnymede
in
1215.”
now,
i
think
the
case
we
have
here
is
just
as
elementary
as
that.
and
we're
getting
away
from
that.
a
man's
home
is
no
longer
his
castle.
if
we
permit
these
people
let
--
and
i
think
that
with
all
of
due
respect
to
mr.
duffy
here,
i
don't
think
he
explained
to
us
too
thoroughly
what
this
man
told
taylor
and
if
he
had
something
to
controvert,
i
think
it
should
have
been
brought
out
at
the
hearing
on
this
matter,
but
it
was
not.
so
let's
proceed
next
to
the
ordinance
itself.
you
put
in
the
hands
of
the
housing
inspector
without
any
independent
or
any
intermediate
judicial
officer
the
right
to
go
in
and
inspect
an
unlimited
number
of
times.
there
is
no
word
said
in
here
about
whether
he
inspect
in
the
morning
and
if
he
gets
teed
off,
to
excuse
by
slang
remark,
maybe
comes
back
in
the
afternoon
or
he
could
send
the
--
maybe
he
wants
to
come
in
the
afternoon
and
get
in
the
evening
because
--
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
well,
that's
what
the
ordinance
says,
as
i
read
it.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
we
have
the
observation
of
the
judge
of
the
common
pleas
court
that
the
ordinance
authorizes
an
unlimited
number
of
inspection
--
judge's
power.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
if
it
became
a
question
of
harassment
--
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
--
you
can
see
if
they
will
work.
we
don't
have
that
case
before
us.
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
the
ordinance
does
authorize.
now,
as
to
the
condition
of
this
man's
house
and
the
objectives
of
this
ordinance,
of
course,
it's
to
eliminate
rundown
houses,
to
eliminate
slumps,
to
protect
the
people.
well,
let's
--
like
we
say
about
some.
everybody
is
opposed
to
that.
everybody
is
opposed
to
rundown
houses.
everybody
is
opposed
to
houses
becoming
slumps.
we're
all
--
we're
all
against
that,
but
all
the
evidence
here
is
that
this
house
is
as
clean
and
neat
as
pent
inside
and
out.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
i
think
we
should
--
the
case
should
be
--
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
on
the
arbitrarily
--arbitrariness
and
the
capriciousness
of
this
ordinance,
i
think
it
clearly
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
don't
know
where
they
advance
it,
your
honor.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
well
--
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
i
don't
think
it
could,
your
honor.
i
like
to
make
one
observation
here
about
securing
process
for
entering
these
houses.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
dissent
in
frank
v.
maryland,
page
11,
mr.
justice
brennan
speaking.
the
second
paragraph
on
page
11,
“england,
a
nation
no
less
mindful
of
public
health
than
we
keenly
conscious
of
civil
--
civil
liberties
has
long
proceed
on
the
basis
that
where
a
citizen
denies
entrance
to
a
health
inspector,
a
search
warrant
is
needed.”
i
think
that's
a
clear
situation
here.
it
may
call
up
for
legislation
but
the
--
the
legislature
is
set
to
provide
legislation
if
that
is
needed.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
i
haven't
read
the
--
the
article
that
your
honor
referred
to.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
well,
i
--
i
do
think
that
it's
possible
to
get
appropriate
process
where
there
is
an
objection
to
the
entry
of
the
housing
inspector.
now,
we
are
told
that
this
ordinance
was
passed
pursuant
to
the
police
powers
of
the
state
and
that
the
common
counsel
has
made
this
legislative
determination
of
facts
that
no
warrant
is
needed.
and
i
would
call
the
attention
of
the
court
through
its
own
decision
here,
mere
legislative
here.
i
have
taken
the
place
of
fact
in
the
determination
of
issues
involving
life,
liberty
or
property
clearly
transcends
due
process
of
law.
that's
manley
v.
georgia,
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
and
further,
as
to
the
questions
of
police
power
legislative
enactments
in
the
exercise
of
police
power
are
limited
requirements
for
due
process
--
are
limited
by
the
requirements
of
due
process
law
--
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
whitney
v.
california.
and
as
to
whether
this
would
unduly
hamper
or
restrict
the
state
to
require
process
before
the
entry
of
a
home
or
a
private
home,
there
is
nothing
in
this
prohibition
to
--
which
tends
to
lessen
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
for
the
public
welfare
but
the
guarantee
of
the
due
process
demands
that
the
law
should
be
reasonable
--
should
not
be
unreasonable,
arbitrary
or
capricious.
and
that
the
mean
selected
shall
have
a
reasonable,
a
real
and
substantial
relation
to
the
objects
sought
to
be
obtained,
that's
in
nebbia
v.
new
york,
291
u.s.
502.
those
cases
were
cited
in
the
brief.
and
again,
the
last
--
a
question
that
has
been
raised
here
that
since
reference
was
made
to
the
fourth
amendment
rather
than
the
fourteenth
amendment
used
the
case
properly
in
court
and
stated
here
the
philosophy
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
thus,
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
well
expressed
by
mr.
justice
butler
speaking
in
--
for
the
majority
in
agnello
v.
united
states,
269
u.s.
20,
32,
“the
search,”
--
and
this
is
a
quote,
“the
search
of
a
private
dwelling
without
a
warrant
is
in
itself
unreasonable
and
abhorrent
to
our
laws.”
and
i
think
when
we
get
to
the
heart
of
the
question
as
to
whether
we're
in
court
or
not,
i
think
only
this
court
can
say.
and
i
would
refer
to
the
case
of
lovell
v.
the
city
of
griffin,
griffin,
georgia
quoted
at
304
u.s.
444.
this
is
a
case
that
has
been
cited
many,
many
times
since
it
was
originally
decided
by
this
court.
and
the
meat
of
this
is
we
think
that
this
question
was
adequately
presented
and
was
decided
in
the
instant
case
whether
it
was
so
presented
and
whether
it's
decided
is
itself
a
federal
question.
and
a
long
line
of
decisions
is
referred
to
in
this
decision.
more
recently,
this
court,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
black
ion
staub
v.
the
city
of
baxley,
baxley,
georgia
and
reported
in
355
u.s.
313,
“whether,”
and
this
is
a
quote
and
reversing
the
state
of
georgia,
this
court
stated,
“whether
a
pleading
sets
up
a
sufficient
right
of
action
or
defense,
grounded
on
the
constitution
or
a
law
of
the
united
states,
is
necessarily
a
question
of
federal
law,
and
where
a
case
coming
from
a
state
court
presents
that
question,
this
court
must
determine
for
itself
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations
displaying
the
right
or
defense,
and
is
not
concluded
by
the
view
taken
by
the
state
court.”
and
that's
how
we
contend
primarily
that
we're
in
this
court.
and
this
court
itself
will
decide
whether
we
are
or
not.
i
would
also
refer
the
court,
this
is
also
in
a
brief
in
carter
v.
texas.
this
is
a
very
early
case
cited
at
177
u.s.
442
or
they
reported
at
177
u.s.
442
and
that
is
also
cited
in
the
lovell
v.
griffin
case.
to
--
to
delve
into
this
question
a
bit
further
as
to
how
the
case
maybe
presented
to
this
court,
it
appears
from
all
the
cases
that
counsel
has
been
able
to
research
on
the
subject
that
no
particular
form
of
words
or
phrases
are
essential
if
the
complete
record
shows
by
clear
intendment,
the
claim
of
invalidity
of
the
state
statute
was
timely
raised
in
the
state
court.
the
first
reference
that
i
have
found
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
and
the
due
process
clause
is
in
the
reply
brief
of
mr.
eaton
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
the
trial
court.
this
is
--
quote
appears
in
the
appendix,
page
42.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
i
would
say
substitute
brief,
your

i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
substitute
brief,
the
appellant
substitute
brief.
there
is
a
brief
and
there
is
an
appendix
and
--
at
page
42.
this
is
a
reply
brief
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
montgomery
county,
ohio,

111465
(inaudible)
in

taylor,
plaintiff,
v.
the
city
of
dayton,
defendant,
reply
brief
of
the
respondent,
excerpt,
“in
addition
to,”
and
this
is
a
quote,
“in
addition
to
a
violation
of
the
search,”
and
this
is
quoted,
“search
and
seizure
provisions
of
the
constitution,”
that
obviously
referring
to
the
fourth
amendment,
the
federal
constitution,
“it
is
the
contention
of
respondent
that
the
acts
taken
and
threatened
violate
“due
process”
and
“equal
protection”
clauses
of
the
constitution,”
see
connor
v.
board
of
commissioners
of
logan
county,
12
f.
2d
789,
whether
that
federal
case
is
so
particularly
in
point,
i'm
--
i
wouldn't
urge
either
way.
but
i
would
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
--
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely

mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
that
is
also
there,
your
honor.
that
--
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
i'm
afraid
--
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
of
the
ohio
court?
i
have
it
here,
your
honor.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
that
is
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
namely,
mr.
eaton
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
and
then
on
the
following
page,
your
honor
--
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
oh,
that's
--
the
brief
itself
is
on
file
in
this
court.
i
--
i
don't
have
the
--
the
verbiage
covered
by
the
ellipses,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
brief
itself.
it
has
concerted.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
no,
i
do
not
have
it.
it's
in
the
court
(inaudible)
your
honor.
and
of
course,
in
this
quotation
from
wolf
v.
colorado,
that's
based
entirely
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it's
cited
for
that
purpose.
that
profound
others,
i
--
as
i
read
clear
english.
mr.
elbert
e.
blakely
thank
you.
