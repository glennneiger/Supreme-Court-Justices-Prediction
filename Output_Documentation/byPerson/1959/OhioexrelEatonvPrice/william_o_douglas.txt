were
--
in
those
3000
cases
in
portland
where
they
effort
--
was
there
an
effort
made
to
get
search
warrants?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
know
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
you
know
what
that
is,
don't
you,
what
you
want
to
see?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
you
know
what
you
--
what
you
want
to
see,
don't
you,
before
you
come
in?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
that
you
might
get
a
warrant
by
--
issued
by
a
magistrate,
if
you
showed
that
there
had
been
no
inspection
for
x
years
and
that
x
period
show
that
that
was
a
danger
point.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
have
to
say
that
there
is
a
violation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
dissent,
i
think
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
speak
for
itself
but
i
--
i
think
that
really
--
that
on
the
basis
of
--
of
experiencing
this
field
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
search
warrant
at
a
regular
interval
showing
that
--
unless
it
was
done
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
wouldn't
experience
show
that
in
some
--
some
of
these
fields.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
respects
for
example
electric
wiring
that
the
experts
know
that
it
must
be
done
at
a
--
within
a
certain
time
to
be
safe,
and
a
magistrate,
i
--
i
wouldn't
see
why
he
would
say,
“well,
that
isn't
probable
cause.”
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
what
magistrates
have
to
--
that's
one
of
the
functions
they've
performed.
they
sit
and
they
determine
whether
this
affidavit
is
sufficient,
whether
the
--
the
word
of
this
informer,
the
word
of
the
man
who
is
signing
it,
the
word
of
the
people
mentioning
it,
they
could
be
counted
upon
to
be
relied
upon
or
whether
they
are
reputable,
whether
they
--
whether
it's
expert
opinion,
whether
it's
just
(inaudible)
opinion
and
all
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
just
the
term
in
all
those
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
how
--
how
do
you
know
he
is
going
to
say
that?
if
he
is
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
certainly.
that's
--
that's
a
part
of
our
system
of
government
that
the
--
that
the
policeman
or
the
--
it
is
not
the
lord
and
king
of
--
of
the
creation.
he
--
he
is
--
he
submits
himself
to
the
magistrate.
that's
true
in
every
case
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
you're
talking
about
is
that
it'd
be
much
better
if
we
didn't
have
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
william
o.
douglas
