i
notice
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
at
page
4
of
the
record,
this
sentence,
“the
petitioner
refused
to
permit
housing
inspectors
to
enter
his
home
on
several
different
occasion.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
significance
that
we
--
we've
had
to
that
as
to
the
identity
of
this
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
point
of
my
question,
mr.
furman,
really
was
this.
as
the
case
gets
here,
is
this
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
judge
which,
for
our
purposes,
we
have
to
accept
whatever
the
record
may
show?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
this
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
a
judge,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
duffy,
do
your
police
officers
have
any
of
these
inspection
duties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
said
on
that
mr.
rhyne,
but
am
i
wrong
in
my
impression
that
there
are
municipalities
in
which
these
inspection
duties
are
performed
by
police
officers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rhyne,
before
you
leave,
would
you
mind
telling
me
if
you
can
help
me
with
the
question
i
put
to
your
colleague
namely
whether
there's
any
practice
that
you're
familiar
with
in
municipalities
to
have
police
officers
enforce
these
inspection
ordinances?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
association
is
largely
in
the
larger
municipalities
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
