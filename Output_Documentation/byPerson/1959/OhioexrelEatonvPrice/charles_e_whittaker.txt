whittaker
mr.
rhyne
you
don't
have
to
accept
it
as
true
but
you
can
accept
it
as
coming
from
one
who
served
the
tenement
house
department
of
new
york
and
had
to
do
with
these
violations.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
rhyne,
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir?
suppose
one
of
these
inspectors
in
the
course
of
the
inspection
comes
upon
contraband
or
evidences
of
crime,
is
he
under
--
having
gain
admission
under
this
ordinance,
entitled
to
take
cognizance
of
what
he
thus
sees?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
might
you
have
the
issue
here,
however,
if
a
warrant
were
issued,
a
warrant
to
search
the
premises,
if
it
were
required
and
issued
and
entry
was
gained
under
it,
then
would
not,
perhaps,
the
inhabitant
of
the
house
be
subject
to
all
of
the
incidental
encumbrances
inherent
in
that
warrant?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
not
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
am
i
right
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
may
i
ask
you?
i'm
not
thinking
--
perhaps
i'm
thinking
about
another
baltimore
case
but
did
not
the
supreme
court
of
maryland,
subsequent
to
our
decision
in
the
frank
case,
hold
that
in
an
instance
where
an
inspector
gone
in
to
make
an
--
a
sanitary
inspection
and
yet
run
on
to
some
contraband
and
he
took
it,
and
they
--
they
tried
to
use
it
against
him
in
a
criminal
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
maryland
suppressed
and
said,
“you
cannot
do
that”?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
the
same
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
