are
the
rest
of
us
beyond
penance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
population
of
dayton?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
just
one
housing
inspector
in
that
city?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
and
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
referred
to
housing
inspectors
were
denied.
and
you
say
--
the
statute
says
or
the
ordinance
says
housing
inspector
in
the
singular,
i
don't
get
the
answer
--
point
of
that
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
housing
inspector
means
a
housing
inspector.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
mean
just
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
mean
just
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suppose
i
don't
know,
it's
long
time
since
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
statute
says
when
a
housing
inspector
does
this.
that
doesn't
mean
only
one
must
be
allowed
to
do
that.
i
suppose
the
old
new
york
tenement
laws
has
a
--
a
tenement
housing
inspector
but
doesn't
mean
that
there's
only
one
in
the
city
of
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
been
the
description
of
the
--
of
--
of
an
officer
holder
with
a
housing
inspector.
it
doesn't
mean
that
is
allowed
to
be
only
just
one.
it's
a
description,
it
isn't
an
exclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rhyne,
unless
i'm
--
i
may
be
wrong,
but
the
old
law
on
new
york
city
was
that
the
validity
of
a
statute
under
which
an
indictment
is
brought
or
under
which
an
arrest
is
sought
could
be
tested
on
habeas
corpus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
search
warrants
--
was
there
a
basis
for
getting
search
warrants
in
these
18
cases
that
you
just
referred
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rhyne,
you
probably
know
of
how
many
houses
there
are
in
the
city
of
new
york
that
fall
under
the
tenement
house
law,
which
covers
the
house
occupied
by
three
or
more
families.
there
would
run
into
the
hundred
of
thousands,
wouldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
hundred
of
thousands.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
there
is
a
--
do
you
happen
to
know
how
many
tenement
house
inspectors
there
are
in
new
york
and
must
run
into
the
large
number?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
numerous,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
under
the
new
york
law,
they
make
periodic
inspections
about
the
safety
of
the
fire
escapes,
the
plumbing,
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
heater.
could
they
possibly,
could
they
possibly
have
the
basis
that
is
required
for
a
search
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
sham
to
say
you
can
get
whole
sale,
you
can
just
get
a
search
warrant
at
large
is
in
direct
defiance
of
--
of
--
so
far
as
the
federal
laws
are
concerned
of
the
fourth
amendment,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
alternative,
it's
either
periodic
inspection
by
the
health
officers,
i
don't
know
what
they're
called
now,
we
--
we
called
them
(inaudible)
in
my
days,
or
let
them
go
without
--
without
inspections
and
leave
probably
millions
of
new
yorkers
to
the
mercy
of
landlords,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
--
if
you
--
if
an
--
if
a
warrant
could
be
issued
for
this
health
inspections,
as
justice
whittaker
suggest,
then
under
the
guidance
of
that
warrant,
they
could
do
police
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
right
to
assume
that
--
that
health
inspectors
will
be
doing
health
inspecting
work
and
not
--
not
going
out
of
their
way
or
--
or
taking
on
police
duty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
right
to
assume
that
public
officials
who
take
oath
to
this
country
obey
to
their
oath
and
append
to
what
they
do
what
they
do
or
supposed
to
do
and
not
to
do
some
other
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
stick
to
their
jobs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
supreme
bench
of
baltimore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
would
you
get
a
search
warrant
with
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
(inaudible)
you
said
everything
is
perfect.
everything
is
hunky-dory
in
this
place,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
so,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
say,
“yes,
you
can
look
at
it.
i've
got
a
--
i've
got
bad
electric
system
or
the
closet
or
water
pipe
is
--
is
out
of
order
but
you
get
me
a
search
warrant,”
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
can
say
there's
a
disclosure.
you
got
to
get
a
search
warrant
on
a
non-disclosed
for
all
the
magistrate
knows
a
perfectly
innocence
wreck
local
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
get
a
wholesale
search
warrant.
would
that
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
read
the
dissent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
advocate
it,
it
stated
it.
he
didn't
advocate
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
part
from
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
duffy,
if
it's
unconstitutional
to
go
into
a
house
without
a
search
warrant,
i
don't
see
how
any
law
has
sort
of
driving
the
city
authorities
who
say,
“yes,
go
in.”
and
if
he
--
he
may
let
you
in,
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
say
it
is,
but
i'd
say
if
this
court
says
that
--
that
you
can't
ask
him
without
a
search
warrant
and
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
impose
upon
the
community
entry
without
a
search
warrant
on
this
chance
that
they
want
to
oppose
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
blakely,
have
you,
at
any
chance,
read
an
article
in
a
very
recent
issue
of
the
chicago
--
chicago
law
review
by
an
english
lawyer
dealing
with
the
english
law
and
showing
that
they
serious
limitations
to
the
accuracy
of
that
statement
or
what
the
english
law
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
might
have
enlightened.
i
don't
say
that
that
governs
us
but
that
isn't
quite
the
usual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
second
case
you
cite,
isn't
that
the
case
where
this
court
sent
the
case
back
to
the
minnesota
court
to
find
out
whether
they
did
deal
with
a
federal
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
not
indicated.
that's
what
we
did
there,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
said
that
--
we
couldn't
tell
if
it
was
ambiguous
and
therefore,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
was
asked
a
state
whether
it
did
or
didn't
pass
on
the
federal
constitutional
point.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
