mr.
charles
s.rhyne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
say
first
of
all
that
our
position
is
that
this
case
is
not
properly
here
at
all.
he
mentioned
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now,
what
did
they
say
in
that
petition?
they
say
that
the
earl
taylor
is
unlawfully
imprisoned,
restrained
and
deprived
of
his
liberty.
there
is
no
mention
in
that
petition
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
is
no
mention
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
any
of
the
pleadings
in
this
case
until
the
notice
of
appeal
filed
after
the
rehearing,
it's
been
denied
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
and
none
of
the
assignments
of
error
and
none
of
the
opinions
that
the
three
opinions
of
the
courts
in
ohio
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
discussed
and
at
no
time
below
was
this
ordinance
drawn
in
question
as
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
of
course,
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
dependent
upon
when
it's
reviewing
a
final
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
a
state,
that
the
ordinance
be
drawn
in
question
as
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
yes,
there
was.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
it
was
raised
in
this
way.
in
the
court
of
common
pleas,
the
--
it
was
contended
that
this
ordinance
violated
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
similar
provision
of
the
ohio
constitution.
it
was
contended
there
that
the
violation
was
of
the
reasonable
search
and
--
and
seizure
provision
of
the
--
of
the
fourth
and
--
amendment
and
the
--
the
ohio
constitution.
and
the
courts
all
along
the
line
pointed
out
that
of
course
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
states
and
they
proceeded
to
consider
this
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
was
a
violation
of
the
similar
ohio
constitutional
provision.
and
this
is
crystal
clear
in
the
opinions
of
the
court.
in
fact,
the
only
mention,
the
only
mention
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
any
court
below
is
in
the
--
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
opinions
where
they
have
a
quotation
from
the
givner
case,
a
maryland
case,
and
it
just
happens
to
mention
down
in
the
body
of
the
quotation
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
after
we
raise
this
jurisdictional
point
here,
the
appellants
did
the
rather
unprecedented
thing
of
filing
all
of
the
briefs
in
all
the
courts
below.
in
order,
they
said,
to
demonstrate
that
they
did
indeed
raise
this
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
unfortunately,
those
briefs
don't
help
them
at
all
because
the
--
in
all
three
briefs
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
supreme
court,
they
do
have
a
quotation
from
--
from
wolf
versus
colorado,
which
mentions
the
fourteenth
down
in
the
quotation.
but
these
are
--
that's
quoted
under
a
provision
of
their
briefs
in
all
three
instances
that
argues
that
this
ordinance
is
a
violation
of
the
ohio
constitution
and
of
the
fourth
amendment
not
of
the
fourteenth.
and
interestingly
enough,
in
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
brief,
counsel
distinguishes
the
instant
case
and
the
givner
case
in
maryland
on
the
ground
that
the
givner
case
in
maryland
involved
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
involves
the
fourth
in
the
ohio
constitution.
and
they
made
the
same
distinction
in
the
ohio
supreme
court.
so
the
only
real
mention
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
below
is
made
in
a
brief
amicus
curiae
filed
by
the
ohio
civil
liberties
union
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
now,
that
mere
mention
by
the
supreme
court
of
this
amicus
curiae
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
certainly
not
a
drawing
in
question
sufficient,
at
least
at
that
level,
to
sustain
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
now,
the
provision
that
relates
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
that
requires
the
drawing
in
question
below,
i
think,
is
--
is
founded
on
two
very
sound
things.
number
one,
when
you're
reviewing
a
--
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
a
state
as
a
matter
of
comity,
you're
going
to
reverse
them
on
a
ground
that
wasn't
raised
below,
the
least
--
and
since
this
--
you're
in
effect
reviewing,
you
should
review
what
they're
--
what'
they're
--
what
they
did
below
and
what
they
said
below,
and
it
--
it
wasn't
raised
at
all
below.
you're
not
really
reviewing
what
the
--
what
the
lower
court
did
or
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
did.
now,
here,
where
you
have
a
challenge
to
something
that's
been
done
since
the
real
founding
of
our
--
our
nation
and
a
claim
that
a
new
constitutional
right
is
being
erected
and
you're
questioning
ohio
action,
ohio
legislation
and
ohio
courts,
the
very
least
that
could
be
required
is
that
you
get
the
views
of
the
ohio
courts
on
this
question.
and
it
seems
that
this
--
this
statute
was
put
in
here
to
--
to
require
the
people
who
--
who
challenge
state
statutes
in
particular
to
specify
and
to
specify
with
a
--
with
a
riffle,
not
a
shotgun,
their
objections
why
they
think
this
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
it's
very
sound
statutory
procedure
and
very
sound
that
the
court,
in
its
decisions,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
has
always
held
that
you
must
use
the
words
and
not
try
to
come
here
by
analogy
or
afterthought.
now,
it's
true
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
mr.
justice
whitaker
said
in
the
frank
case,
does
apply
the
--
the
heart
and
core
of
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
provisions
of
the
fourth
states.
but
again,
the
argument
that
the
--
the
fourteenth
was
applied
in
that
way
was
not
at
all
before
the
ohio
courts
all
the
way
up.
they
merely
construed
their
own
constitutional
provision
and
pointed
out
quite
properly
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
no
application
in
ohio
or
to
--
to
state
action.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
know
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
--
i
think
that
when
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
answering
your
second
question
first.
it's
true
that
the
ohio
civil
liberties
union
brief
did
mention
both
the
fourth
and
the
fourteenth
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
--
in
the
ohio
supreme
court.
but
the
ohio
supreme
court,
under
its
own
rules,
could
not
consider
any
attack
on
this
ordinance.
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
two
lower
courts.
now,
this
attack
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
common
pleas.
so
that
question
couldn't
be
presented
even
to
the
parties
in
the
ohio
supreme
court.
now,
with
reference
to
the
quotation
from
wolf,
i
pointed
out,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
quotation
comes
under
a
section
of
their
brief
in
which
they
argue
that
this
ordinance
is
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment,
not
under
fourteenth.
and
that
counsel
in
his
brief,
both
instances
where
he
cited
wolf
verus
colorado,
says
this
case
is
different
from
the
baltimore
case
because
that
case
involved
the
fourteenth
and
this
involves
the
fourth.
so
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
courts
below
considered
that
the
fourteenth
was
ever
cited
to
them
or
argued
to
them
as
a
reason
for
the
invalidity
of
this
ordinance.
so
in
concluding
on
this
point,
i
would
say,
your
honor
please,
that
we
believe
that
the
purpose
and
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
code
provision
governing
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
would
be
violated
if
this
case
is
taken
and
--
and
reviewed
under
these
circumstances
where
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
never
mentioned
below
and
the
pleadings
are
about
the
courts.
now,
moving
to
the
--
to
the
merits,
we
rest
our
case
completely
and
squarely
on
the
frank
case.
and
before
discussing
the
ordinance,
i
would
like
to
correct
my
adversary
just
slightly
on
the
facts.
it's
true
that
all
the
evidence
was
offered
by
them,
but
it's
also
true
that
in
that
evidence,
on
page
21,
this
man
said,
“i
am
the
building
inspector
or
the
housing
inspector,”
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page
when
it
says,
“who
are
you
anyway?”
and
he
said,
“i
am
the
building
inspector
or
the
housing
inspector.”
and
then,
in
addition
to
that,
on
page
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
it's
then
the
second
time
--
it's
not
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
just
ahead
of
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
says
this,
“then
the
second
time,
the
fellow
came
out,
he
entered
the
same
way.
he
came
up
like
that
and
then
he
called
on
the
telephone
and
wanted
to
know
if
he
could
come
to
my
house
and
inspect
the
inside
of
the
house.”
it
--
i
don't
believe
it's
clear
whether
it's
on
the
telephone
or
--
or
not.
now,
to
the
me,
this
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
said,
“who
are
you
anyway?”
he
said,
“i'm
the
building
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
all
right.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
--
i
say
the
--
i
think
the
--
i
would
conceive
that
it
is.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
and
on
page
42,
they
offered
the
--
the
warrant
in
this
case.
all
the
evidence
they
offered
themselves.
the
warrant
says
this,
and
i
quote
only
part
of
it.
it's
--
it's
this
quoted
in
page,
“he
unlawfully
refused
to
permit
a
duly
authorized
agent
of
the
division
of
housing
inspection
of
the
city
of
dayton
to
enter
and
survey
the
said
premises.”
now,
returning
to
the
--
to
the
record
itself,
i
think
it's
--
it's
quite
clear
over
on
page
29
and
--
and
30
that
this
man
was
properly
identified
as
a
housing
inspector.
down
at
the
very
bottom,
it
says
this,
“we
understand
you,
earl,”
in
answer
to
mr.
eaton's
questions,
“that
you
wouldn't
object
the
plumbing
inspectors
and
electrical
inspectors
coming
into
your
home.”
answer,
“well,
i
told
him
this
fellow
called
me
on
the
telephone
and
asked
me
if
they
would
come,
the
plumbing
inspectors
or
electrical
inspectors.”
“could
they
come
in?”
and
i
said,
“they
could
come
in
but
you
can't.”
“you
have
no
objection
to
a
plumbing
inspector
coming
into
your
home
to
inspect
the
plumbing?”
“i
do
not.”
“you
have
no
objection
to
an
electrician
coming
in
and
inspect
the
electrical
wiring?”
and
overall
in
page
30,
“do
you
have
any
objection
to
a
fire
inspector
coming
in
to
inspect
a
fire
danger?”
“no,
sir.”
“it's
just
the
housing
inspector
that
you're
objecting
to
it,
is
that
right?”
“yes,
sir.”
question,
“can
you
tell
the
court
why
you
would
discriminate
between
housing
inspector
and
the
other
inspectors?”
and
after
an
objection,
he
was
allowed
to
answer,
“well,
if
you
want
me
to
tell
the
truth,
i
will
tell
you.
i
don't
think
that
the
man
that
they
have
got
as
inspectors
are
qualified
in
a
position
to
go
through
a
man's
house
and
inspect
anything
before
they
have
never
worked
at
the
business.”
now,
i
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
they're
talking
about
housing
inspector.
there
was
no
question
below
or
anytime
in
connection
with
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
housing
inspector
was
involved
here.
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
may
i
just
answer
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
all
of
the
testimony
from
pages
--
starting
about
page
13
to
the
end
of
it
indicates
that
all
they
were
talking
about
were
housing
inspectors,
that
everyone
assume
that
these
people
were
housing
inspectors.
they
--
it's
true
that
no
question
has
been
raised
in
any
court
below
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
--
about
whether
they
were
not
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
the
--
the
trial
court,
which
i
suppose,
made
the
only
finding
of
facts
and
said
was
the
one
who
heard
mr.
taylor
and
considered
this
evidence.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
on
page
4,
i
--
i
can't
say
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
would
say
that
it
is,
your
--
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
on
page
4,
he
--
in
--
in
the
third
paragraph,
he
says
this,
“the
petitioner
refuse
to
permit
housing
inspectors
to
enter
his
home
on
several
different
occasions
without
a
search
warrant.”
now,
i
think
--
as
i
say,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
all
they
were
talking
about
is
--
is
housing
inspectors
and
that
this
man
did
offer
identification
as
a
housing
inspector.
you
heard
the
testimony
read
here.
it
said
he
put
the
--
the
identification
back
in
his
pocket
in
a
hurry,
but
at
least,
he
offered
some
identification.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
think
the
--
the
language
that
was
read.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
believe
it's
on
page
20
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
--
22
in
the
middle
where
the
answer
is,
“the
last
time
he
was
there,
a
colored
fellow
and
white
fellow,
they
came
up
to
the
door
and
i
walked
out
there
and
he
said,
“mr.
taylor?”
i
said,
“yes,
sir.”
he
showed
like
a
picture.
he
had
a
picture
on
a
piece
of
paper.
and
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
stuck
it
back
in
his
pocket.
he
said,
“the
housing
inspector
wanted
to
inspect
your
house.”
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
going
to
labor
or
push
the
point
except
i
do
sincerely
believe
that
a
full
and
fair
reading
of
this
testimony
will
allow,
at
least,
a
conclusion
that
the
judges
in
ohio
and
all
the
way
through
that
these
people
were
housing
inspector
and
properly
identified
as
such.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
am
quite
convinced
with
that.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i'm
relying
on
all
of
the
testimony
because
it
has
been
assumed
all
the
way
through
that
there
was
no
question
about
these
people
being
housing
inspectors
and
identifying
themselves
properly
because
the
ordinance
requires
it,
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
presumption
that
the
ordinance
was
complied
with
unless
there
is
some
strong
evidence
showing
that
it
was
not.
now
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
no
trial
as
yet,
no.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
think
mr.
duffy
can
answer
that
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
--
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
was
a
majority
and
a
minority
rule
in
--
in
ohio.
they
would
go
ahead
and
--
and
hear
the
--
and
determine
the
appeal
even
though
the
man
had
not
been
tried
and
heard
on
habeas
corpus.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
that's
right.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
wouldn't
agree
with
you
on
that
he
couldn't.
he
had
a
home
and
could
have
made
bail
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
--
rather
easily.
i
--
i
think
that
what
--
this
was
a
routine
thing.
he
came,
he
pleaded
not
guilty,
the
bond
was
fixed
and
he
--
instead
of
making
the
bond,
he
sought
to
get
out
on
--
on
habeas
corpus.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
his
testimony
was
that
he
had
put
$2500
in
his
home.
and
i
think
that
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
these
public
officials
in
dayton
are
reasonable
people.
and
--
they
let
him
out
without
any
bond,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
it
came
up
on
habeas
corpus
on
his
own
recognizance.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
they
fixed
this
routine
thousand
dollar
bond
goes
to
the
--
to
the
validity
of
this
ordinance
at
least.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
the
ohio
rule
seems
to
be
the
same,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
now,
on
the
merits,
i
don't
--
the
--
the
facts
are
--
are
here.
i'm
not
quarreling
about
the
facts
stated
by
my
adversary.
he
did
say
that
the
reason
he
wouldn't
let
these
housing
inspectors
in
was
that
they
were
--
were
unqualified.
he
let
everyone
else
but
he
didn't
think
these
people
were
qualified.
now,
this
dayton
ordinance
is
reasonable
and
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power,
and
i
called
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
narrow
ordinance.
it
authorizes
inspection
“to
determine
the
condition
of
willingness”,
to
determine
the
condition
of
willingness.
it's
not
an
authorization
to
inspect
persons
or
rummage
through
personal
effects.
it's
limited
to
the
structure
itself
and
the
installations
which
are
a
vital
part
of
that
structure.
and
since
the
validity
of
this
ordinance
or
any
ordinance
for
that
matter
must
be
decided
in
the
light
of
the
conditions,
the
need
which
produced
it.
i
think
it's
important
to
notice
that
in
the
--
whereas
clause,
on
page
44
of
the
record,
the
city
council
of
dayton
made
a
finding,
which
i
think
should
be
considered
in
considering
the
validity
of
this
ordinance.
it's
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
“whereas
in
the
city
of
dayton,
there
are
dwelling
and
rooming
houses
which
are
so
dilapidated,
unsafe,
dangerous,
unhygienic
or
insanitary
as
to
constitute
a
hazard
and
menace
to
the
health,
safety,
morals
and
welfare
of
this
residents
of
said
dwellings
and
rooming
houses
as
well
as
of
the
people
of
the
city
of
dayton.”
i
think
that
finding
indicates
what
this
ordinance
was
adapted
to
accomplish.
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
requires
entry
at
a
reasonable
hour,
it
shows
that
this
is
not
a
knock
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
there
is
no
power
to
force
entry.
identification
is
required.
and
if
after
this
inspector
is
admitted,
he
finds
defects,
what
does
he
do?
he
gives
a
notice
in
writing
to
correct
them.
and
then,
what
happens?
if
they
are
not
corrected,
all
the
housing
inspector
can
do
is
to
go
into
court
and
get
an
order
requiring
that
the
dwelling
be
vacated
or
that
the
part
of
it
that's
unsafe
be
vacated.
this
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
the
entire
ordinance,
mr
justice
black,
is
not.
i'm
sorry
that
it
isn't.
it's
--
it's
a
part
of
the
record
that's
filed
here
but
not
printed.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
and
then
the
--
the
entire
ordinance
is
--
is
quite
lengthy,
and
i
think
the
--
it's
--
it's
really
--
i
wish
that
we're
all
in
the
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i'm
referring
to
parts
that
are
quoted
in
the
record
as
a
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
--
it's
page,
i
think,
89.
it
is
on
page
88
and
89.
i'm
referring
to
the
parts
of
the
ordinance
that
are
--
that
is
quoted
there
where
it
--
it
says
that
they
--
if
they
don't
comply
with
this
notice,
then
the
ultimate
thing
is
that
the
housing
inspector
shall
seek
a
court
order.
i'm
reading
from
page
89
of
the
record
in
the
court
of
--
shall
seek
a
court
order
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
for
the
vacation
of
such
dwellings
or
part
thereon.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
would
certainly
--
this
is
the
only
one
i
have.
i
will
--
would
leave
it
here.
it's
just
a
complete
copy
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
believe
it's
--
it's
part
of
the
municipal
court
record
and
i
don't
understood
it
was
on
file
here,
mr.
justice
black.
now,
the
city
of
dayton,
of
course,
rest
this
case,
as
i
have
said,
100%
on
the
frank
decision
because
the
--
the
general
structure
and
scheme
of
this
ordinance
is
no
different
from
the
general
structure
and
scheme
of
the
ordinance
that
was
involved
in
the
--
in
the
frank
case.
in
fact,
i
think
there
are
more
safeguards
in
--
in
this
case
and
this
identification
is
required
and
baltimore
does
not.
there
is
the
distinction
that
my
adversary
referred
to
about
this
cause
to
suspect
that
a
nuisance
exists,
which
is
in
the
baltimore
ordinance
and
not
in
the
dayton
ordinance.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
that
particular
provision
of
the
baltimore
ordinance
was
the
reason
for
the
decision
in
frank.
i
think
that
the
frank
case
was
based
upon
the
idea
that
from
the
beginning
of
our
country
and
now,
you
have
had
these
inspections
for
health
and
safety
reasons,
and
that
these
hidden
hazards
cannot
be
discovered
from
the
outside.
when
something
smells
or
smokes
or
scourges,
it's
too
late.
now,
this
routine
systematic
inspection
idea,
the
fact
that
--
that
you
can't
inspect
from
the
outside,
i
think,
is
demonstrated
by
--
by
two
things
that
are
contained
in
the
briefs
here.
first
of
all,
the
reference
to
the
experience
in
the
city
of
new
york,
which
is
quoted
by
amicus
curiae
on
page
5
of
their
brief,
where
they
say
that
in
a
15
block
area,
there
were
567
complaints.
the
grand
jury
investigating
slums
there
had
this
15
block
area
inspected
and
found
12,445
violations.
and
then
on
page
21
of
our
own
brief,
we
give
the
experience
in
dayton
where
four
years
ago,
16
people
died
because
of
defective
gas
heaters,
unvented
gas
flues.
three
years
ago,
nine
died.
two
deaths
each
in
the
last
two
years.
and
last
year,
under
this
ordinance,
there
were
2912
defective
gas
flues
discovered
upon
inspection
which
could
not
have
been
discovered
from
the
outside.
and
in
10
instances,
the
violation
was
so
bad
that
they
had
to
call
the
utility
to
come
and
cut
all
the
gas
at
once.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
so
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
not
at
all,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
they
couldn't
see
the
unvented
gas
flue
from
the
outside.
so
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
this
systematic
inspection
has
ever
been
the
basis
of
the
type
of
thing
that
we're
--
i
mean,
that
--
that
the
--
the
requirement
of
probable
cause
has
ever
been
required
for
the
type
of
inspection
that
we
have
here.
and
i
--
it
is
certainly
true
that
this
--
in
the
last
few
years
is
the
first
that
there
has
been
any
question
raised
at
all
about
this
type
of
inspection
and
particularly
that
anyone
has
a
constitutional
right
to
prevent
it.
i
call
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
dayton
has
had
an
ordinance
on
this
subject
since
1846.
and
at
1846,
they
required
the
homeowners
to
allow
inspectors
to
come
in
and
inspect
chimneys
and
flues
and
stoves
for
fires.
and
then
there
is
a
whole
series
of
ordinance
that
dayton
has
had
since
then
just
as
baltimore,
it
had
in
the
frank
case.
so
something
that
--
that
the
people
have
never
considered
to
be
a
violation
of
their
constitutional
right
to
raise
it
to
the
status
of
a
constitutional
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
going
quite
far.
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
while
it's
true,
the
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
apply
the
unreasonable
search
and
--
and
seizure,
a
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
states
under
the
decision
of
this
court
that
the
fourth
does
not
prohibit
all
entries,
it
prohibits
only
unreasonable
entries.
and
in
this
instance,
where
something
has
been
done
in
--
in
dayton
for
more
than
100
years
and
no
one
has
questioned
it,
when
it's
been
done
all
over
the
country
where
historically,
the
community
has
always
protected
itself
against
the
carelessness
of
the
individual.
and
i
also
call
attention
of
the
--
of
the
court
to
the
fact,
and
i'm
--
i'm
glad
the
--
the
entire
ordinance
will
be
before
the
court
now
because
this
ordinance
requires
running
such
thing
as
running
hot
and
cold
water,
bathrooms.
the
--
the
things
that
are
--
are
needed
today
and
people
are
not
going
to
live
like
cattle.
and
of
course,
this
ordinance
is
aimed
at
protecting
the
poor
and
the
helpless
who
live
in
slum
areas.
those
poor
and
--
and
helpless
will
not
get
heat
or
anything
else
unless
the
police
power
steps
in
and
--
and
requires
it.
i
think
that
the
emphasis
upon
decent
housing
and
in
recent
years
is
one
of
the
--
the
greatest
things
that's
going
on
in
our
country
because
in
these
slum
areas,
why,
that's
where
disease
and
crime
breed
and
grow.
and
this
police
power,
which
has
existed
from
the
very
beginning
of
our
country
without
question,
it's
true,
it
--
it's
expanded
some
because
of
the
requirements
of
--
of
urbanized
living.
a
man
now
doesn't
have
as
much
space
around
his
house
as
he
used
to.
his
--
he
doesn't
have
a
house
with
a
motor
around
it.
it's
his
castle
because
his
home
is
connected
by
water
and
sewer
and
--
and
electricity
and
gas
and
drainage
to
his
neighbors.
he's
really
only
as
safe
as
his
neighbors.
and
if
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
consider
it
a
search
in
the
first
place.
i
think
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
no,
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i'm
saying
that
this
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i'm
arguing
historically,
mr.
justice
black,
that
this
has
never
been
considered
a
search
within
the
fourteenth
or
the
fourth
amendment.
and
even
if
you
measure
it
by
that
yardstick,
it's
not
an
unreasonable
search.
i
would
--
would
certainly
say
that
--
that
that's
true.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
think
it's
rather
interesting
that
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
think
it's
rather
interesting
that
in
the
entire
history
of
our
country,
it's
never
before
thought
to
rise
to
a
constitutional
right.
now,
privacy
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
think
that
this
is
not
a
search
for
criminal
evidence.
and
of
course,
there
is
where
the
--
the
fourth
amendment
is
brought
into
play.
if
this
was
a
--
a
search
for
criminal
evidence,
if
this
was
a
--
a
search
to
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
--
to
carry
out
the
criminal
laws
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
this
ordinance
doesn't
allow
him
to
go
in
and
break
in.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
he
has
any
right
to
--
to
break
in.
this
ordinance
says
doesn't
give
him
any
such
right.
and
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
--
he
can
only
enter
under
the
authority
conferred
on
him,
mr.
justice
black.
now,
in
the
--
the
fourth
amendment,
the
situation
where
--
there
you're
going
in
to
--
to
make
a
--
a
criminal
search
and
this
type
of
--
of
inspection
simply
can't
be
carried
out
from
the
courthouse.
and
--
and
you
have
a
lay
down
certain
rules
that
are
required
in
order
to
get
a
warrant
to
--
to
show
probable
cause,
and
you
can't
show
probable
cost
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
the
fourth
does
--
amendment
doesn't
setup
any
kind
of
a
double
standard
where
you
can
get
one
type
of
probable
cause
for
a
criminal
entry
--
search
entry
and
another
for
something
else.these
health
inspectors
just
can't
be
turned
into
process
servers.
you
can't
carry
out
this
health
protection
from
a
--
from
a
courthouse.
this
is
a
prevention
thing.
it's
not
a
punitive
thing
at
all.
it's
--
it's
much
for
the
protection
of
mr.
taylor
as
it
is
for
the
community.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
this
is
--
this
is
an
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
an
--
this
is
an
entry
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
people,
not
a
search.
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
this
--
they
don't
go
there
to
take
anything
out
of
the
house.
they
don't
rummage
through
their
old
drawers
or
anything
like
that.
and
this
is
entirely
a
preventive
anything
to
--
to
protect
the
--
the
residence
of
the
dwelling.
and
i
think
that's
particularly
important
in
the
--
in
the
slum
areas
of
the
--
of
the
nations
where
this
landlord
would
never
bring
their
houses
up
to
standard,
unless
there
was
some
police
power,
police
there
to
make
them.
and
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
in
this
type
of
case,
you
can
justify
a
search
warrant
because
you
can't
tell
from
the
outside
what
is
on
the
inside.
this
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
don't
think
they
want
to
break
in
or
get
in
here.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
think
that
--
that,
mr.
justice
black,
i
said
this
is
something
that
has
gone
on
from
the
time
our
nation
was
in
wilderness,
they
have
always
gone
in
and
inspected
homes.
the
history
of
this
was
reviewed
in
the
frank
case.
we
reviewed
it
in
our
brief
here
insofar
as
ohio.
they
have
the
same
history
in
ohio
as
it
had
in
the
--
in
maryland.
and
i
--
i
really
feel
that
--
that
this
is
something
that
has
never
been
considered
as
--
on
the
basis
that
man
has
a
constitutional
right
to
prohibit
the
representative
of
the
community
at
large
who's
coming
in
to
protect
the
community
against
his
individual
carelessness.
that's
about
what
it
amounts
to.
now
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
a
difference
between
this
ordinance
and
the
baltimore
ordinance.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it
goes
to
the
existence
of
the
power
to
come
in
and
inspect
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
at
large.
it's
true
that
baltimore
requires
more
than
does
dayton.
but
i
would
agree
with
what
was
said
in
the
frank
case
when
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
this,
“time
and
experience
have
forcefully
thought
that
the
power
to
inspect
dwelling
places
either
as
a
matter
of
systematic
area
by
area
search
or
as
here
to
treat
a
specific
problem
is
of
indispensable
importance
to
the
maintenance
of
community
health,
a
power
that
would
be
greatly
hobbled
by
the
safeguards
necessary
for
our
search
of
evidence
of
criminal
acts.”
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
now
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
course
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
there
is
a
difference.
there's
no
question
with
baltimore
requires
more
than
does
dayton
in
that
particular
instance,
but
i
also
call
your
attention
to
the
finding
that
the
city
council
of
dayton
made
about
the
fact
that
there
exist,
these
houses
which
are
a
menace
to
the
health,
safety,
morals
and
welfare,
these
dilapidated
unsafe
dangers,
unhygienic
and
unsanitary
homes.
so
they
made
a
general
finding.
and
these
inspections
were
made
to
try
and
find
out
whether
or
not,
on
the
inside,
these
houses
look
as
safe
as
they
might
contend
they
are
on
the
outside.
and
as
i've
cited
the
experience
there
with
the
unvented
gas
flues,
you
just
can't
tell
whether
or
not
they're
safe
on
the
inside.
and
i
think
that
--
that
in
the
olden
days,
when
they
went
in
to
inspect
the
stoves
and
flues
and
things
like
that,
you
couldn't
tell
from
the
outside
whether
those
things
were
unsafe
on
the
inside.
and
i
--
i
think
the
same
thing
applies
here.
and
i
think
that
under
modern
conditions,
there's
all
the
more
reason
to
have
this
type
of
inspection.
and
i
think
that
if
this
type
of
inspection
were
placed
on
a
consent
basis,
it
was
suggested
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
in
the
frank
case
that
--
that
one
revel
a
year
wasn't
too
much
to
pay
for
this
new
constitutional
right
that
was
suggested
there.
amicus
curiae
had
shown
what
happens.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
there
might
be
[laughs],
mr.
justice
black,
between
them
but
i
--
i
think
that
it's
never
been
thought
to
exist
before,
at
least,
i've
made
a
thorough
search
of
the
--
of
the
cases
and
everything
else,
and
i've
lived
in
the
municipal
field
for
good
many
years.
and
this
is
the
first
time
in
some
25
years
of
my
work
in
this
field
that
anybody
has
suggested
that
you
have
such
a
constitutional
right.
but
on
this
portland,
oregon
experience,
we
have
the
fact
that
portland
placed
their
inspections
on
a
consent
basis,
and
what
happened?
last
year,
in
1959,
from
the
beginning
of
the
year
up
until
november
when
we
found
this
amicus
curiae
brief
here
on
--
after
the
city
attorney
has
mentioned,
3234
people
in
portland
refused
to
let
the
housing
inspector
in.
now,
i
think
it's
indicated
that
if
this
type
of
inspection
rhymes
to
a
halt
that
the
difficulty
with
widespread
areas
of
--
slum
areas,
breeding
disease
and
fire
and
epidemic
and
miscarriages
will
be
a
tremendous
difficulty.
it
will
jeopardize
the
health
and
safety
of
thousands.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
mr.
justice,
i
can
not
answer
that.
we
received
the
information
about
that
from
the
city
attorney
of
--
of
portland.
he
put
it
into
that
brief
amicus
curiae.
i
cannot
answer
the
question.
i
--
i
would
assume
quite
frankly
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
a
search
warrant
in
nearly
all
the
cases
because
you
just
can't
tell
what's
on
the
inside
from
the
outside.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
oh,
yes,
many,
many
thousands.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
yes,
many
thousands.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
can't
answer
that.
there
--
there
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
oh,
yes.
the
city
of
new
york
has
the
largest
budget
in
this
country
aside
from
the
states.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
heating
water.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
don't
think
so,
not
under
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
--
the
rules
that
are
laid
down
by
this
court.
and
i
don't
think,
as
i
say,
you
could
have
a
double
standard
of
requirements,
one
for
the
criminal
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
very
much
so,
very
much
so.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
that's
--
that's
very
true.
and
i
--
i
don't
think
there
could
be
any
better
conclusion
to
--
to
my
argument.
i
will
now
turn
this
argument
over
to
my
associate,
mr.
duffy.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
say
to
you,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
worst
that
could
happen
to
the
public
health
than
to
stop
these
inspections
as
they're
being
conducted
out
now
--
conducting
now
because
we
have
finally
after
years
of
effort
saw
the
city
fathers
on
the
idea
that
--
that
the
public
health
is
some
concern
of
theirs.
and
now,
they're
doing
it
--
and
they're
doing
it
on
a
tremendous
scale
and
to
stop
it
would
bring
about,
in
my
view,
tremendous
rise
in
the
crime
rate
and
the
disease
rate
in
this
country.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
unless
it
has
some
reference
to
the
structural
safety
or
the
sanitation
of
the
home,
that
is
not
why
he
is
there,
he
is
there
to
--
entirely
to
--
to
inspect
the
condition.
it
said
it
limits
his
authority
to
the
condition
of
the
dwelling.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
no,
the
--
the
issue
is
--
is
not
--
not
here.
i
would
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
that,
i
would
agree
that
that's
an
entirely
different
kind
of
a
situation
then
--
then
exist
here,
mr.
justice
whittaker.and
that
that
would
bring
on
a
whole
host
of
problems
that
--
it's
rather
hard
to
cope
for
--
with
because
this
kind
of
a
situation
has
never
been
conceived
of,
as
--
as
i
read
history,
as
being
something
that
you
could
issue
a
warrant
for
it
to
take
in
the
--
both
ohio
court.
they
point
out
that
ohio
became
a
state
in
1802
and
then
in
1803,
they
--
they
issued
the
formal
warrants
that's
followed
there
and
they're
all
directed
towards
a
search
for
criminal
evidence
not
this
type
of
thing.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
that's
--
that's
a
possibility
that
i
had
not
considered
because
i
--
i
hadn't
thought
to
that
point
but
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
maybe
turn
these
people
into
policemen
that
they're
not
trained
for.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
this
whole
case,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
is
that
you
can't
find
in
the
cases
any
contentions
of
that
kind,
that
one
of
these
inspectors
went
in
to
look
at
a
(inaudible)
fireplace
years
ago
and
--
and
saw
something
else
and
turned
it
over
to
police.
now,
mr.
justice
douglas
that
you
cited
[laughs]
one
instance
in
baltimore
that
arose
rather
quickly
after
the
frank
case
but
--
and
maybe
you
have
others.
but
i'm
saying
that
in
the
municipal
field
in
general
that
i
have
lived
in
for
good
many
years.
these
types
of
things
have
not
been
raised.
so
evidently,
these
housing
and
health
inspectors
haven't
been
straying
beyond
what
they're
authorized
to
do.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
certainly
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
would
--
i
would
certainly
hope
so.
their
only
authority
here
is
to
inspect
the
condition
of
dwellings.
that's
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know
what
comment
that
i
could
make
there
other
than
that.
and
i
think
that
most
public
officials
in
this
country
are
honest
in
trying
to
carry
out
their
duties.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
black.
i
have
never
seen
that
written
in
the
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
i
have
never
seen
it
written
into
any
city
ordinances.
and
i
mentioned,
i
have
read
as
many
city
ordinances
as
anyone
else.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i
--
i
think
i
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
no,
i've
never
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i've
never
seen
that
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
i've
never
seen
that
provision.
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
douglas
instance
over
in
baltimore
where
he
sent
policemen
to
make
the
arrest
rather
proved
some
point.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
that's
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
--
illustration.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
well,
it
depends
on
the
weeks
decision
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
yes,
i
think
it
was
in
the
--
not
in
the
supreme
court
of
maryland
but
in
the
--
mr.
charles
s.rhyne
city
court
of
baltimore.
