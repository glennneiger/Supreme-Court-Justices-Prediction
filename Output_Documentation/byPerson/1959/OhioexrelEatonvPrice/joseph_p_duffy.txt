mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
if
the
court
please.
i
would
like
to
add
just
a
word
or
two
in
addition
to
what
mr.
rhyne
has
said.
possibly,
i
--
i
might
be
able
to
shed
some
light
on
some
of
the
questions
since
i
am
wholly
familiar
with
the
ordinance
and
the
reasons
lying
behind
its
adoption.
in
answer
to
you,
justice
frankfurter,
as
to
the
number
of
inspectors,
the
ordinance
itself,
which
you
will
have,
we
will
see
to
it
that
you
are
given
a
copy,
does
set
up
a
bureau
of
inspection
under
the
head
of
a
chief
inspector.
there
are
no
limited
numbers
if
that
says
that
the
bureau
of
inspection
shall
consist
of
the
chief
inspector
together
with
such
subordinates
as
he
make
the
--
at
the
present
time,
i
believe
there
are
seven
such
inspectors
under
the
head
of
a
chief
building
inspector.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
in
--
in
the
housing
inspection.
now,
we
have
various
other
types
of
inspection,
fire
inspection,
police
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
--
health
inspection
and
so
forth.
but
under
the
housing
inspection,
there
are
other
seven
inspectors.
we
would
like
again
to
stress
the
fact
that,
to
us
at
least,
we
feel
there
is
a
difference
between
a
search
and
an
inspection.
now,
we
say
that
fully
cognizant
of
judge
prettyman's
decision
where
he
refers
to
webster's
dictionary
as
search,
meaning
to
look
for
and
inspect,
meaning
to
look
at.
i
would
like
only
to
ask
a
learned
judge
one
question
and
that
would
be
whether
or
not
he
would
rather
look
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
or
look
at
a
needle
in
a
haystack.
now,
to
us,
there
is
just
that
much
difference
between
a
search
and
an
inspection.an
examination
of
this
ordinance
will
disclose
that
there
are
five
main
problems,
heating,
sanitation,
means
of
ingress
and
egress,
the
square
foot
area
which,
of
course,
includes
the
ventilation
and
light
of
the
room,
and
the
electrical
installations
in
that
dwelling.
those
five
are
the
main
issues,
the
main
objects
of
any
inspection,
which
the
inspectors
are
looking
for.
now,
it's
evident
that
your
kitchen
sink,
your
electrical
installation,
your
square
foot
area,
your
windows,
your
stairways,
your
doorways
are
things
that
can
be
looked
at.
it
is
not,
as
mr.
rhyne
said,
something
that
you
have
to
rummage
through
a
man's
personal
possessions
to
--
to
see
the
mere
entry
into
the
building.
and
each
and
every
one
of
these
objects
are
there
in
front
of
the
inspector.
it
is
not
necessary
for
him
to
disturb
one
item
of
personal
property
of
that
property
owner
or
occupant.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
the
electrical
outlets,
your
honor,
very
definitely.
we
find
particularly
in
the
rooming
house
the
coffee
pot,
the
toaster,
the
dryers
and
--
and
this
and
that
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
--
are
all
attached
to
one
outlet.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
they
overloaded
the
circuit.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
well,
i
assure
you
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
no.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
well,
i
think
--
possibly,
i
--
i
have
misled
you.
we
do
have,
in
addition
to
this
housing
ordinance,
the
housing
ordinance
is
aimed
primarily
at
the
older
type
dwelling,
where
you
want
to
remodel
or
rehabilitate
a
--
a
used
structure.
now,
in
addition
to
this
ordinance,
we
have
a
building
code
that
would
cover
any
new
construction.
and
of
course,
on
a
new
construction
and
the
electrical
wiring
and
so
forth
that
goes
into
the
walls
that
is
hidden,
that
is
covered
under
the
building
inspection
and
not
under
this.
so
that
the
items,
as
i
say,
that
this
particular
ordinance
are
aimed
at,
are
--
the
--
the
hazards
from
fire
due
to
the
overloading
of
the
electric
circuits.
and
there,
the
only
thing
that
the
inspector
needs
to
see
is
how
many
outlets
are
there
and
how
many
various
types
of
electrical
appliances
are
being
used
on
that
outlet.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
well,
i
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
i
think
mr.
rhyne
gave
you
the
only
answer
i
can
give
your
honor
and
that
is
these
men
have
an
ordinance
to
enforce.
and
they
are
not
going
out
of
their
way,
they
are
not
looking
for
work.
if
they
go
in
to
the
property,
they're
going
to
look
for
these
things
and
nothing
else.
certainly,
it
is
true
that
they
might
see
some
contraband
or
some
violations
of
some
other
law.
but
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
they're
going
to
go
out
of
their
way
for
that.
they're
going
to
have
all
they
can
do
to
enforce
this
ordinance.
and
seven
men
in
the
city,
i
believe,
justice
frankfurter,
you
asked
the
size
of
dayton,
it
is
considerably
larger
than
250.
it's
closer
to
350,000.
and
seven
inspectors
in
a
city
of
that
size
are
going
to
have
their
hands
full.
so
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
--
now,
certainly,
we
can
assume,
and
i'm
not,
i'm
not
telling
this
court
by
any
means
that
there
might
not
be
an
abuse
on
the
part
of
some
of
these
inspectors.
but
wouldn't
that
same
possibility
be
there
even
though
he
had
a
search
warrant?
and
even
armed
with
a
search
warrant,
isn't
he
going
to
be
a
little
more
likely.
having
that
legal
documents
in
his
hand
to
abuse
his
privilege
than
if
he
hasn't
it.
i
--i
think
so,
i
don't
know.
but
i
--
i
don't
think
the
obtaining
of
a
search
warrant
is
the
answer
to
our
problem.
as
--
mr.
rhyne
has
said,
certainly
if
we
wait
until
a
smoke
can
be
seen,
the
fire
or
the
smell
emanates
from
that
structure,
we
are
in
a
state
of
emergency
then.
and
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
when
an
emergency
exists,
then,
of
course,
no
search
warrant
is
necessary.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
no,
your
honor.
we
do
have
a
fire
inspection
service.
now,
that
service
is
conducted
by
the
division
of
fire
itself.
this
housing
is
under
our
building
department.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
which?
the
--
the
housing
or
the
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
the
housing
looks
for
just
the
--
the
five
major
items
that
i
have
listed.
there
are
some
provisions
in
here
with
reference
to
rooming
houses
and
the
changing
of
linens
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
with
reference
to
the
structure
itself,
there
are
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
the
fire
inspectors'
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
--
chief
concern
is
the
accumulation
of
rubbish,
that
sort
of
thing,
that
would
breakout
into
a
configuration,
means
of
ingress
and
egress
are
covered
by
the
fire
inspection.
there
are
also
--
there
is
no
duplicate.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
do
the
police
officers
make
any
inspections?
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
no.
in
answer
to
your
question
also
on
the
matter
of
arrest,
the
--
the
inspectors
have
no
power
to
arrest,
justice
was
done
in
this
case.
the
housing
inspector
would
have
to
go
to
the
prosecutor.
an
affidavit
would
have
to
be
obtained.
the
warrant
would
be
served
by
the
police
department,
and
the
arrest
would
be
made
by
the
police
department.
the
health
inspector
had
no
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
there
could
be.
it
is
not
true
in
dayton.
i
--
i
don't
know.
again,
i
believe,
justice
black,
you
mentioned
the
matter
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
looking
at
the
ordinance,
our
adversaries
have
never
once
questioned
any
particular
section
of
that
ordinance
as
being
unreasonable.
i
think
each
and
every
section
contained
in
the
ordinance
is
based
upon
public
health
and
safety.
that's
what
it's
aimed
at.
and
at
no
time,
at
any
level,
has
anyone
raised
a
question
of
the
ordinance
itself
being
unreasonable.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
that
is
what
we
--
we
hope
the
ordinance
will
accomplish.
that's
what
it
was
designed
to
accomplish.
and
to
date,
as
--
as
mr.
rhyne
has
said,
we
know
that
it
has
saved
the
lives
and
has
saved
property.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
well
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
no.
it
is
but
made
into
a
division
of
building
inspection
with
a
chief
building
inspector
and
on
his
deputies
under
him.
yes,
it
is
recognized
as
very
serious.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
we
do
have
--
i
don't
have
the
figures
at
hand.
these
particular
housing
inspectors
in
1958
conducted
over
12,000.
now,
how
many
in
1959
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
i
wouldn't
have
any
idea.
i
imagine
it's
--
it's
tremendous.
but
as
i
say
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
actually
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
actually,
since
this
case
was
filed,
the
boys
have
not
made
any
great
effort
until
we
have
received
this
court's
decision
on
the
legality
of
their
effort.
they
have
not
attempted
to
force
anyone.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
refusals?
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
i
would
say
not
over
10,
10
a
year
at
the
very
most,
that
--
that
would
be
high.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
you
couldn't,
your
honor.
you
couldn't.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
under
ohio
law,
i
assume
it's
the
same
all
over.
the
only
way
you
can
obtain
a
search
warrant
is
under
oath
and
you
must,
under
in
your
affidavit,
you
must
particularly
describe
the
thing
that
you're
looking
for
and
the
thing
that
you
want
to
cease.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
this
men
are
not
going
to
cease
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
this
man
was
told,
i
believe
it
was
said
here,
that
he
was
not
told
what
they
wanted
to
see.
he
was
told,
the
record
will
show.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
the
inspectors
do,
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
i
don't
think
under
this
--
is
this
thing
specific?
i
don't
think
under
this
ordinance
that
they
could
say
there
is
a
violation
of
any
particular
section
here.
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
oh,
yes,
you
have,
to
under
oath
by
affidavit,
describe
the
thing
you're
looking
for.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
oh,
we
don't
know.
we
have
to
accept
his
word
because
we
didn't
get
it
in.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
[laughs]
as
i
say
that's
what
we
would
be
faced
with.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
that's
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
yes,
and
as
mr.
rhyne
said
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
--
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
that
would
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
i
--
i
think,
judge,
what
we
would
be
faced
with
there
would
be
the
different
opinions
the
different
persons
would
have
of
that
very
thing
that
you
are
asking.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
well
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
yes,
but
the
--
the
magistrate
is
going
to
say
10
years
and
the
housing
inspector
says,
“no,
we
should
do
it
every
two
years.”
so
where
--
where
are
you?
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
well,
i'll
say
you
--
you're
running
into
that
possibility
that
there
is
going
to
be
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
well,
if
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
i
--
i
can
see
--
say
that
it
is
possible
to
do
it
that
way
but
if
it
is
done
that
way,
the
housing
inspector
would
be
spending
90%
of
his
time
in
court
rather
than
out
making
the
inspection.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
oh,
you
mean
only
do
you
get
it
in
the
case
of
an
objection.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
as
mr.
rhyne
said
at
the
minute
the
citizens
learn
that
the
thing
is
optional,
they're
all
going
to
say
no.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
well,
he
has
the
portland
experience
to
show
that.
3000
refused
also.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
i
don't
think
it
is
unconstitutionally
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
the
other
matter,
your
tax
assessor,
now,
ohio
law,
and
i
assume
the
law
is
the
same
all
over
the
country,
has
every
right
to
go
in
a
man's
property
for
the
purpose
of
appraising
it
--
that
property.
and
i've
never
yet
heard
anyone
say
that
he
can't
come
in
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
under
our
ohio
tax
law,
it's
a
50
--
an
increase
50%
penalty
on
the
amount
of
tax.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
the
--
the
statute
has
given
him
the
right
to
go
in,
but
as
you
say,
if
the
property
owner
says,
“no,
get
a
search
warrant
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
that's
correct.
there's
no
criminal
--
there
is
no
incarceration
--
mr.
joseph
p.
duffy
--
connected
with
the
penalty.
thank
you
sir.
