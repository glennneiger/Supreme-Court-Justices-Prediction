you
say
were
--
they're
at
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
--
any
efforts
made
to
explore
with
that
information
was
by
the
defendants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
go
in,
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
indifference
of
opinion
between
you
and
counsel
for
the
government
as
to
when
the

was
made?

mr.
calihan,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
did
have
some
information,
did
they
not,
according
to
their
testimony
that
one
of
these
men
was
implicated
in
the
--
in
interstate
commerce
violation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
think
that
the
agent
when
he
testified
to
that
meant
that
by
implication,
he
was
just
--
he
was
just
working?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
under
the
rule
of
evidence,
he
was
precluded
from
asking
what
was
told
him,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
tried
--
did
they
try
to
go
into
the
question
as
to
--
as
to
what
the
implication
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
objection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
an
objection,
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
time,
they
went
up
to
the
alley?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
time
they
went
up
to
the
wrong
alley?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
the
judge
assess
the
reason
why
they
went
up
that
wrong
alley
in
connection
with
the
rest
of
their
conduct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
normally
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
but
i
wondered,
if
it
couldn't
be
considered
in
connection
with
other
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
patterson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
there
something
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
information
came
from
the
employer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
anything
was
said
by
the
petitioner
and
his
codefendant
before
the
officers
said
anything
to
them
after
they
just
waved
them
down.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i'd
like
to
know
if
--
what
was
said
anyway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
after
they
were
waved
down
but
before
the
officers
did
anything
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
finish
the
sentence.

justice
