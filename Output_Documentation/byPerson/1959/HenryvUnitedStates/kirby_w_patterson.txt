mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
there's
one
thing
i
would
like
to
clear
up
at
the
outset
of
my
remarks.
a
question
was
asked
yesterday,
i
believe
by
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
difference
in
the
position
of
the
government
and
the
petitioner
as
to
time
the
arrest
took
place.
the
answer
is
no,
there
is
not.
i
might
explain
just
exactly
how
that
came
about
because
it
is
of
importance
as
the
to
the
government's
position
generally
in
similar
cases.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
contended
throughout,
has
contended
throughout
and
from
the
beginning
that
the
arrest
took
place
at
the
time
the
car
was
stopped.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
below
to
indicate
that
that
position
was
taken
by
the
government
except
on
the
opinion,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
dissenting
judge
mentioned
that
the
government
attorney
in
the
course
of
oral
argument
conceded
that
the
arrest
took
place
at
the
time
the
car
was
stopped.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court
on
our
brief
in
opposition,
we
adhered
to
that
concession.
we
felt
obliged
to
do
so.
at
the
same
time,
we
indicated
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
concession
and
we
have
reiterated
that
position
on
our
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
case.
so
--
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
arrest
took
place
at
the
time
the
car
was
stopped.
we
have
indicated
and
i
think
we
should
state
at
this
time
very
briefly,
what
we
think
that
law
is
generally.
we
do
not
think
that
merely
stopping
a
car
for
questioning
of
the
occupants
constitutes
an
arrest.
there
must
be
more.
there
must
be
an
intent
to
take
a
person
in
question
into
custody
to
answer
for
a
crime,
answer
in
court.
since
an
arrest
is
more
than
merely
stopping
of
a
car,
it
takes
more
to
justify
an
arrest.
it
takes
probable
cause
to
justify
an
arrest.
merely
stopping
the
car
we
say,
speaking
of
the
law
generally,
that
it
is
only
necessary
that
the
action
of
the
officers
be
reasonable
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
in
stopping
the
individual
whether
he'd
be
in
a
vehicle
or
not
and
questioning
him
as
to
the
possible
commission
of
a
crime.
now,
that
question
will
be
presented
to
your
honors
in
a
later
case,
number
52,
rios,
which
is
coming
up
this
term
and
i
mention
it
--
for
that
reason,
separate
key
(inaudible)
for
the
court.
we,
the
concession
which
we
thought
obliged
to
adhere
to
in
this
case,
applies
only
to
this
case
and
does
not
state
position
of
the
government
generally.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we
are
not
exactly
asking
it,
mr.
justice,
but
we
are
not
arguing
the
other
point.
the
other
side
is
really
asking
me
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes
and
we
adhere
to
that
concession
below,
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
our
position,
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
that
concession
has
been
made
and
we
adhere
to
it.
there
is
another
ground
on
which
the
action
of
the
officers
could
be
justified.
we
do
not
feel
ourselves
that
we
can
urge
that.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
think
the
court
could.
i
don't
think
we
in
good
conscience
can
urge
any
view
of
the
government's
concession.
i
think
the
government
can
sustain
the
action
of
the
lower
court
on
any
ground
on
which
the
facts
show
it
can
be
sustained.
however,
we
do
not
think
that
in
all
propriety
we
should
urge
that
ground
in
view
of
the
concession
which
was
made
below
and
the
adherence
to
that
concession
which
was
made
on
the
brief
on
our
position
of
the
case.
it
is.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
think
the
court
could
do
that.
i
think
myself
and
--
i
think
perhaps
this
was
supposed
to.
i
think
that
the
case
rather
clearly
shows
probable
cause
but
i
--
i
do
think
in
answering
your
question,
i
do
think
that
the
court
and
--
acting
on
this
motion
(voice
overlap)
the
question
goes
here.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
we
would
all
--
let's
hope
for
a
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we're
not
asking
you
to
do
it.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we're
not
asking
you
disregard
it.
we're
only
asking
you
to
regard
the
other.
in
other
words,
they're
the
ones
to
–
you
are
right.
i
see
you're
not
entirely
(inaudible)
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
of
course
as
i
see
it,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct.
then
however,
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
other
members
of
the
court
as
well,
we
are
--
entirely
upon
the
basis
of
probable
cause
in
this
court
because
that
concession
was
made
and
i
think
there
was
probably
cause.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
includes
voluntary
argument
to
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
let
me
just
state
the
facts.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
alright.
let's
just
have
the
facts
this
time.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
let
us
consider
this
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
no.
that
will
not.
that
will
take
three
or
four
minutes.
perhaps
--
no,
perhaps
a
little
bit
more
than
that.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
but
to
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
these
are
the
facts
without
comment.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
these
are
the
facts.
a
federal
offense
had
taken
place
the
night
before
these
events
here
outlined,
and
it
had
taken
place
at
25th
in
canal
st.
in
the
city
of
chicago,
that's
in
south
chicago.
these
officers
--
i
should
say
these
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
record
does
not
show
that
was
undoubtedly
a
substantial
number
of
people.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
(inaudible)
truck
line.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
the
employees.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
think
you
could
take
judicial
notice
--
quite
a
number
of
people,
the
--
involved
in
a
inter-state
truck
line.
then
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
a
federal
offense.
it
was
the
theft
of
whiskey
from
an
interstate
ship.
now,
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
it's
a
simple
matter
stipulation
that
the
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no.
i
think
the
stipulation
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
that
this
whiskey
was
being
shipped
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
--
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes
sir.
now
these
two
officers
on
the
following
afternoon
about
2:10
p.m.,
the
two
fbi
agents,
were
cruising
the
territory
and
looking
for
leads
as
to
that
theft,
and
they
saw
two
men
walking
across
the
street
from
the
redtop
tavern.
now,
as
i
understood
the
statement
yesterday,
it
was
indicated
that
the
petitioner
had
been
in
this
tavern
and
had
been
negotiating
for
the
loan
of
a
car
for
the
purpose
of
betting
a
horse.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
no.
but
i'm
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
--
correcting
a
misstatement
as
i
understood
it,
if
you
please.
as
i
read
the
record,
the
borrowing
of
the
car
had
taken
place
at
least
two
hours
earlier
and
at
another
tavern
and
i
state
that
merely
parenthetically.
these
are
the
facts
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
sir.
no
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
your
honor,
that
will
come
in,
in
another
connection,
i
thought
you
better
bring
it
in
right
now
because
it
--
as
that
point
of
facts
are
brought.
now,
they
saw
these
two
men
and
they
were
known
to
them.
now,
they
were
asked
whether
they
conversed
with
them
and
--
then
they
asked
what
the
nature
of
the
conversation.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
now
they
were
asked
what
--
they
just
simply
said
they
knew.
they
were
asked
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
conversation
was,
and
i
think
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
think
perhaps
by
itself,
it's
a
very
little
significant,
but
i
was
going
on
to
say
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
--
that's
true.
that's
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
they
are
restricted
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
as
to
what
the
nature
their
knowledge
was.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
question
asked
perhaps
is
not
a
very
proper,
what
was
the
nature
of
your
conversation
with
these
two
men?
and
that
the
judge
properly,
i
think,
ruled
out.
then
the
agent
was
asked
this
question,
“did
you
have
information
that
the
companion
of
petitioner
pierotti
was
implicated
in
inter-state
shipments.
there
was
an
objection.
the
court
allowed
the
witness
to
answer
but
restricted
to
answer
to
a
yes
or
no
answer.
his
answer
was
yes.
so,
we
don't
know
what
the
nature
of
the
implication
was.
we
just
have
that
word
and
i'll
come
back
to
that
later
because
as
you
suggested,
i
won't
discuss
the
facts
at
this
time
or
the
statement.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
because
i
--
i
think
i
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i'm
stating
the
facts
right
now.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
i
think
there's
quite
a
bit
more
than
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
the
implication.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
it's
this.
i
think
that
the
common
ordinary
use
or
implicate
when
applied
to
a
criminal
proceeding
is
--
that
it
means
implicated
in
a
crime
or
a
conspiracy
something
of
that
nature.
it's
very
unsatisfactory
in
this
case
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
think
it
could
have
been
asked
better
than
it
was.
i
do
that.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
it
was
--
it
was
asked
--
it
was
not
asked
at
all,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
yet
the
same
time,
the
court
indicated
by
his
two
rulings
there,
i
think
he
probably
indicated
to
the
attorney
who
was
trying
for
the
government.
he
indicated
--
he
wanted
nothing
more
than
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
now,
he
shouldn't
have
done
that.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
agree.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
they
should
have
gone
further.
we
do
in
all
this
--
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
the
next
question
was
that
--
the
next
question
was
--
who
gave
that
information
and
it
was
an
officer
of
the
employer
pierotti
who
gave
it
to
the
agent.
now,
whatever
the
nature
of
that
information
may
have
been,
as
i
say
that
the
record
is
very
unsatisfactory
on
that.
the
--
and
whatever
the
nature
there,
acquaintanceship
was
with
these
two
men.
the
two
agents
apparently
thought
it
was
worth
while
to
watch
them
because
they
did
watch
them.
and
--
they
followed
them
and
they
went
south
along
wall
street
and
turned
west,
back
north
again,
west
again,
and
came
to
a
north
and
south
alley
which
currently
was
the
wrong
alley
because
they
turned
around
and
came
back
to
the
similar
alley
in
the
previous
block,
running
north
and
south
and
there
the
ford
turned
in
and
the
federal
agents
parked
their
car
and
got
out
to
inquire
what
happened,
and
here's
what
they
saw
in
there.
they
saw
the
petitioner
who
was
a
passenger
in
the
car,
get
out
and
move
around
the
car,
go
in
the
gangway
at
the
west
side
of
the
alley
and
come
back
after
about
two
minutes,
carrying
some
cork
woods
and
loading
them
into
the
ford
and
the
ford
then
drove
off
to
north
and
turned
east.
now,
they
were
not
able
to
arrive
the
same
place
to
catch
up
is
expressly
use,
catch
up
with
them.
they
didn't
find
them
again
driving
that
car
but
they
did
then
return,
the
agents
did,
to
the
original
place
where
they
have
seen
the
two
men.
and
they're
parked
in
the
same
spot
for
that
previously
been
was
this
ford.
well,
the
agents
stopped,
and
they
parked
their
car
and
they
watched
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
two
men
came
out
of
the
redtop
tavern,
and
they
stopped
and
talked
and
wait
for
the
parties
that
the
agents
knew
named
bedlow
and
then
they
went
ahead
and
got
in
their
ford
and
drove
off
again.
the
agents
followed
them
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
here's
what
--
i'm
coming
to
that
right
there,
mr.
justice.
they
went
back
on
the
same
course
except
this
time
they
went
directly
to
the
correct
alley,
went
in
there
and
were
again
observed
--
petitioner
was
observed
to
load
out
these
cartons.
and
again,
they
drove
off
to
the
north
part
of
the
alley.
now,
this
time
having
some
indication
where
the
ford
might
be
destined
to
go,
the
agents
headed
down
on
this
end
of
the
block,
the
same
direction
as
the
ford
is
going
down
there
and
after
the
ford
has
gone
a
block
and
half
and
reached
wall
street,
that's
where
the
bar
was
located
--
turned
south.
when
they
turned
south,
the
agents
turned
north
and
they
flagged
them
down.
and
they
moved
their
car
up
ahead
of
the
--
other
car.
now
there's
nothing
in
the
record
indicate
that
any
parallel
hazard
was
involved
in
that
maneuver.
it
was
simply
that
they
had
to
meet
them
from
the
opposite
direction
in
order
to
head
them
off
and
it
is
customary
of
course
among
officers
when
they
stop
the
car
they
park
their
car
in
front
of
the
car
which
is
being
stopped.
now,
those
are
the
facts,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
think
that
is
pretty
--
pretty
fully
covered
and
i
think
that's
it.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
think
that's
pretty
fully
covered.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
right.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
of
course
there
was
just
a
little
bit
more
as
they
were
coming
back
and
heading
back
again
in
the
direction
of
the
tavern
for
the
second
time.
by
that
time,
it
seems
to
me
the
time
had
come
for
action
if
any
action
was
to
be
taken.
well,
of
course
they
couldn't.
they
couldn't
go
--
out
for
a
search
warrant.
that
would
take
them
45
minutes
or
an
hour.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
think
they
could
have,
yes
sir,
but
i
think
by
that
time,
the
bird
would
have
flown.
they
couldn't
find
the
merchandise
by
that
time.
i
think
they
could
have.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
do.
i
do,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
pardon.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
don't
know
the
exact
time
when
mr.
lieberman
gave
this
information
but
it
was
prior
to
this.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we
don't
know
when.
that
doesn't
appear
about
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no.
no,
we
don't
know
when
it
was
at
all.
i
don't
assume
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
knowledge,
the
commission
of
crime
took
place,
the
theft
to
the
whisky,
it
was
the
night
before.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
these
agents
may
have
been
on
duty
that
night
and
more
likely
they've
gone
to
work
the
following
morning
the
day
that
the
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
pardon
me.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we
do
not
know
that.
no
sir.
i
assume
rather
and
it's
only
an
assumption
that
they
had
received
this
information
previously.
they
seem
they
have
known
these
two
men.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct.
that
--
their
minds
were
fixed
on
it,
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
wouldn't
have
any
effect
on
the
question
of
probable
cause.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
what
was
said
--
it
was
not
before
they
were
waved
down,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
what
was
said
was
that
--
as
they
were
getting
out
of
the
car
there
or
as
the
thing
--
the
two
cars
had
been
stopped,
petitioner
said
to
his
companion
who
was
driving,
“hold
it,
it's
the
g's.”
and
the
he
said
“tell
him
you
just
picked
me
up.”
that
or
course
is
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
however,
on
the
question
of
probable
cause
as
of
the
time
of
stopping,
that
was
thereafter
and
we're
not
relying
upon
anything
which
took
place
thereafter
to
show
guilt.
we
are
relying
upon
the
course
of
conduct
which
these
men
had
been
engaged
in
this
--
that
is
rightly
exciting
the
belief
on
the
part
of
the
officers
that
federal
offense
had
been
committed
and
they
--
they
were
the
ones
who
were
implicated
in
that.
now,
in
considering
these
matters,
we
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
thing
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
officers
themselves
rather
than
as
it
may
seem
to
us
as
a
matter
of
hindsight.
the
first
thing
and
all
these
things
must
be
taken
into
the
consideration
with
relation
one
thing
to
another
because
--
while
one
may
be
insufficient,
all
together
in
their
totality
add
up
to
quite
a
bit
and
rightly
exciting
the
belief
on
the
part
of
the
federal
officers
that
they
may
had
been
implicated
in
this
particular
theft
which
they
were
investigating,
of
course
they.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
it
could
be
suspicion.
i
think
--you're
quite
right.
suspicion
is
the
word.
it
comes
more
readily
to
your
mind,
but
i
think
it's
more
than
mere
suspicion.
i
think
there's
a
well
grounded
suspicion
in
this
case.
now,
the
first
thing
--
and
this
is
important
because
it
is
a
federal
offense
that
they
must
have
had
a
reason
to
believe
it
was
being
committed.
there
was
this
federal
offense
which
had
been
committed
from
the
previous
night
in
the
very
near
neighborhood.
it
was
only
six
blocks
from
this
bar,
only
five
blocks
from
where
the
liquor
from
the
alley,
where
the
cartons
were
picked
up.
now,
the
second
thing
is
this.
these
two
men
were
known
to
the
two
officers.
that
in
itself
is
not
a
great
deal.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we
don't
know
what
it
is
but
we
know
that
the
word
implicate
was
used
there
and
to
my
mind,
implicate
ordinarily
carries
the
idea
of
implicating
something
which
is
unfavorable.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
it
came
before.
it
does
--it
does
appear
and
came
before
this,
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
it
does
not.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
that's
quite
true.
and
the
record
is
certainly
for
the
reasons
stated
imperfect
(inaudible)
what
the
nature
that
implication
was,
but
we
do
know
this
objectively
by
the
conduct
of
the
officers
that
whatever
they
knew,
they
thought
was
of
sufficient
importance
to
follow
these
two
men
and
see
what
they
did.
that's
an
objective
fact
in
this
case.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
they're
undoubtedly
are.
of
course
here,
at
this
point,
they
didn't
stopped
and
they
just
decided
these
two
fellows
were
worth
observing.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
i
believe
that
they
were
just
two
men
that
the
officers
do
in
a
perfectly
favorable
life
they
wouldn't.
they
wouldn't
say
as
necessary
to
watch
them.
but
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
he
would
expect
often
in
these
records
that
more
would
appear
than
actually
does.
that's
quite
true.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
correct.
we
are
bound
by
what
does
appear
in
the
natural
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
what
does
appear
in
connection
with
other
facts
and
circumstances
which
were
developed
in
the
course.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
the
whole
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
that's
true.
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
well,
now
our
third
thing
here,
we
certainly
entered
into
these
officers'
consideration
of
time
getting
their
pictures
as
they
saw
it.
that
was
that
this
was
a
tavern
which
was
only
six
blocks
from
the
scene
of
the
theft
and
it
was
a
place
which
could
be
at
least
a
possible
outlet
for
the
stolen
merchandise.
fourth
was
the
fact
that
indirect
course
was
followed
in
reaching
us
out
and
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
correctly
pointed
out
what
the
nature
of
that
indirection
was.
it
was
simply
that
they
passed
up
the
right
alley
went
by
and
had
to
come
back.
now,
that
itself
again
is
not
decisive,
but
it
shows
an
unfamiliar
act
with
the
premise
where
all
the
facts
taken
together
might
indicate
that
they
were
carrying
something
back
and
forth
or
something
going
back
to
the
tavern,
and
i
would
think
it's
empty
beer
bottle.
i
don't
believe
they
take
empty
beer
bottles
according
to
my
information.
but
if
it
was
liquor,
then
it
--
and
he
would
think
and
they
were
engaged
in
picking
it
up
from
a
licensed
place
to
deal
in
liquor.
you
think
they
would
know
where
to
go.
if
it
was
an
ordinary
business
transaction,
it's
something
a
little
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
because
they
were
unfamiliar
with
the
premises.
now
a
fifth
thing
is,
their
conduct
when
they
got
in
to
the
south
as
i
have
indicated,
there
was
no
wholesale
liquor
dealer
at
that
point
with
residential
premises
located
at
this
point.
and
this
was
not
a
commercial
vehicle.
it
was
a
passenger
vehicle
in
which
the
cartons
were
being
loaded.
now,
it's
been
suggested
that
it
might
have
been
groceries
that
was
going
back
there.
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
believe
the
groceries
would
be
picked
up,
a
place
where
a
grocery
store
is
not
shown
to
have
existed,
taking
back
the
bar
specially
when
the
--
there
are
two
trips
here
it
would
seem
that
what
was
being
picked
up
here
if
anything
would
be
the
kind
of
merchandise
that
that
bar
was
licensed
in
allowing
to
deal
in.
then
seventh
i
believe
in
the
--
six
i
should
mention,
i
have
failed
to
mention
sir,
is
the
return
to
the
redtop
tavern,
which
is
a
possible
but
not
necessarily.
the
only
outlet
for
stolen
merchandise
(inaudible)
but
impossible
outlet
and
then
in
(inaudible)
is
the
return
here
and
again,
this
rather
clandestine
picking
up
of
some
kind
of
cargo
which
they
can't
identify.
well,
how
far
must
officers
of
the
law
go
before
they
had
in
cases
like
this.
it's
recognized
as
i've
said
that
you
can't
--
you
can't
get
a
search
warrant
that
even
the
more
restrictive
you've
taken
by
members
of
the
court
is
the
need
for
a
search
warrant
whenever
it's
reasonably
possible.
it's
recognized
that
in
the
case
of
moving
vehicles,
you
cannot
get
it
because
the
merchandise
will
be
out
of
the
way
by
the
time
the
search
warrant
is
obtained.
so
they
must
act
if
it
all
upon
the
probable
cause
which
appears
at
the
very
time.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
anything
told
in
the
record
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
to
indicate
that
these
men
or
either
of
them
were
implicated
in
this
particular
theft.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
so,
there
is
no
chance
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
that
--
at
that
time.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
say
there
was
basis
for
a
search
warrant
after
they
have
seen
all
these
course
of
events
repeated.
i
would
say
there
was
at
that
time
but
there
was
not
the
chance,
there
was
not
the
opportunity.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
think
there
was.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
actually
i
think
that
what
the
--
that
at
time,
no
concession
has
been
made.
looking
at
the
actual
facts,
i
think
what
the
agents
were
attempting
to
do
there
was
to
make
a
search.
they
were
not
considering
actually
arrest
at
the
time
they
stopped
them.
however,
since
it
has
been
conceded
here
that
there
was
an
arrest,
you
can
say
that
the
--
you
can
justify
the
search
in
connection
with
the
arrest,
but
i
think
there
is
probable
cause
independent
of
an
arrest
to
make
a
search
of
that
point.
now,
you
don't
have
to
have
an
arrest
in
order
to
make
a
search,
this
was
decided
by
carroll.
i
think
that
a
probable
cause
existed
there
at
the
time
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes
you
have
to
have,
and
i
think
that
both
--
i
think
both
existed
as
to
the
time
that
the
officers
saw
fit
to
act.
i
was
reading
last
night,
read
an
interesting
article
in
a
current
issue
of
times
relative
to
west
german
butcher
who
found
himself
in
death
both
to
the
government
(inaudible)
for
his
high
living,
and
he
was
going
out
--
he
was
slaughtering
cattle
on
the
greens
and
dumping
the
cattle
in
the
backseat
of
his
mercedes
and
carrying
them
back
to
his
butcher
shop
and
selling
them.
now,
the
wind
up
of
that
article
was,
that
the
way
they
were
apprehended
was
that
an
officer
was
suspicious
because
the
young
man
who
was
driving
the
vehicle,
he
thought
was
too
young
to
be
driving
such
a
large
vehicle.
now,
i
don't
draw
on
that
as
anything
necessarily
after
these
knowledge
facts
on
this
case
but
i
do
point
out
to
show
that
all
over
the
world,
officers
have
to
act.
now,
they
have
to
have
a
reasonable
desire
to
inquire
as
to
suspicious
conduct
in
order
if
ever
saw
anything.
now,
this
officer
had
not
seen
fit
there
to
inquire,
he
would
have
gone
over
and
looked
in
that
car
and
seen
this
beef
which
was
loaded
in
the
backseat
of
the
mercedes
and
these
officers
here
would
never
seen
the
backseat
of
this
car,
the
cartons
which
were
labeled
for
(inaudible)
i
see
my
time
is
up
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
think
my
--
i
think
my
time
is
practically
finished
the
--
i'm
just
trying
to
state
that
the
officers
must
--
they
show
diligence
in
matters
of
this
character
they
never
will
turn
anything
up.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
think
there
must
be
probable
cause
to
connection
--
to
connect
the
--
you
mean
the
petitioner
where
there
possession
of
the
--
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
no.
here's
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
i
understood,
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
you
can.
i
think
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
--
justify
either
way,
mr.
justice.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
think
both
exist
into
this
case
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
--
without
this
but
--
and
the
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
was
just
attempting
to
answer
mr.
justice
whittaker
about
what
they
were
actually
--
the
officers
were
actually
thinking.
i
think
they
were
actually
thinking
of
the
search
rather
than
an
arrest
when
they
stopped,
but
i
think
there
was
ample
problem
for
both.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
our
contention,
of
course,
is
that
as
for
the
probable
cause
for
both.
thank
you,
sir.
