justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
intervene?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
see
if
i
can
get
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
hope
or
don't
hope
is
irrelevant
to
the
duty
of
this
court
to
sustain
a
judgment
which
is
legally
sustainable
on
a
valid
legal
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
without
arguing,
but
just
stating
as
propositions
the
items
that
you
think
add
up
to
probable
cause
on
the
assumptions
that
the
arrest
was
made
when
the
car
was
stopped.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
stating
with
the
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
an
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
minds
of
the
arresting
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
not
take
the
whole
half
hour
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
of
place
--
that
are
industrial
--
at
a
business
localities
which
employed
how
many
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
by
substantial
of
20
or
200?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
you
notice
about
that,
can't
be
in
a
way
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
--
why
must
that
be
assumed,
the
whiskey
might
have
come
to
a
point
of
rest
and
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
maybe
(inaudible)
people
question
of
--
as
to
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
perfect
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
officers
knew
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
has
to
do
with
the
problem?
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
problem,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
other
things?
so,
why
do
we
waste
time
--
i
can
take
your
two
minutes.
there's
nothing
to
do
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
known
to
them?
what
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
anything
--
that's
anything
but
a
mutual
item?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
knew
the
governor
of
illinois
maybe
or
the
congressman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
do
you
come
back
later?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
won't
you
state
now
if
you
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
begins
of
that
--
of
the
significance
of
all
that
there
is
in
the
record
is
what
you've
read
on
page
four
and
five
of
your
brief.
it's
all
--
there
is
on
that
answer.
that's
all
there
is,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
as
the
implication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
there
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
significance
--
what
legal
significance
bearing
on
the
lighter
check
on
probable
cause
you
derive
from
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
u.s.
attorney
could
have
asked
another
question
to
bring
all
that
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
asked
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
going
along
and
kept
that
out
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
an
objection
to
the
question
and
the
court
says,
“you
may
answer”.
will
you
answer
the
courts
yes
or
no
meaning
that
question
is
susceptible
of
an
answer,
it
doesn't
mean
that
another
question
can
be
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
additional
bearing
on
probable
cause
that
happened
between
the
time
that
the
officers
saw
these
men
load
their
car,
load
the
cartons
in
the
alley
and
the
time
that
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
they
could
have
--
from
your
point
of
view,
they
had
all
the
knowledge
they
had
at
the
time
they
stopped
them
when
they
saw
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
they
could
have
stopped
them
right
into
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
when
mr.
lieberman
gave
them
this
information?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
night
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
--
is
it
mr.
lieberman,
i
think
it
is.
when
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
we
don't
know
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
the
night
before,
the
date
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
know
when
knowledge
of
the
--
commission
of
the
crime
took
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
night
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
whether
the
notice
of
the
--
came
to
the
notice
of
the
agents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
whether
knowledge
of
the
theft?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
wouldn't
be
any
evidence
bearing
on
probable
cause
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
probable
cause
that
a
crime
was
committed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
choose
the
word
‘belief'
very
carefully,
i
congratulate
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
fact
that
bit
of
information
came,
you
don't
know
when.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
know,
but
it
doesn't
bear
along
what
then
intimacy
or
intensity
of
knowledge
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
knew
these
men.
i
suppose
the
agents
in
chicago
know
a
hundreds
of
men
who
are
more
or
less
easy
going
characters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that
we
haven't
any
information
or
do
we
have,
of
the
number
of
times
officers
stop
people
and
they
--
it
turns
out
they
stopped
the
wrong
people.
if
i
could
get
those
facts,
my
guess
would
be
that
there
must
be
a
large
number
of
such
mistakes
in
stoppages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
were
well
known
characters,
they
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
would
expect
to
find
a
little
more
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
whole
policy
behind
the
requirement
of
probable
cause
is
that
the
“the
all”
and
“and
all”
is
not
but
even
guilty
people
should
be
convicted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mustn't
forget
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
patterson,
you're
restricted
to
the
record
and
so
am
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
one
knew
and
mr.
lieberman
told
these
agents
that
by
any
chance,
if
they
knew
about
this
the
night
before,
if
one
knew
with
a
knowledge
of
the
theft
came
to
the
agents
the
night
before
then
they
would
have
time
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if,
there
was
no
chance
to
get
--
if
you
had
no
basis
for
--
to
search
warrant,
you
have
no
basis
for
arrest
without
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
sir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
probably
by
your
statement
that
you
can
disregard
whether
or
not
there
was
an
arrest,
there
was
probable
cause
for
a
search,
how
could
there
be
a
probable
cause
for
a
search
of
the
listed
goods
by
the
petitioner,
unless
you
have
probable
cause
of
connecting
him
with
the
possession
of
the
illicit
liquor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
give
you
ample
--
if
you
connect
him,
if
you
have
probable
cause
for
connecting
with
the
possession
of
these
interstate
stolen
things
that
would
have
probable
cause
for
arresting
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
you
said
a
while
ago
that
you
could
justify
the
search
without
relying
on
the
arrest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that
because
you
couldn't
justify
probability
for
search
unless
you
have
probable
cause
for
drawing
the
inference
of
criminality
and
that
will
give
basis
for
arrest
and
if
you
haven't
got
that,
and
you
have
that
probable
cause
for
search.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
alright
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
offer
to
be
a
choice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
we
mean
--
what
we
have
to
decide,
we
have
to
search
--
x-ray
their
mind
what
the
basis
was
on
which
their
acts
was
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
their
action
was
taken
was
--
that
the
action
taken
was
an
arrest
and
there's
maybe
a
reasonable
search
for
a
valid
arrest.
if
there
was
no
basis
for
the
arrest,
then
my
submission
is
that
there
wasn't
any
basis
for
the
search.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
be
interest
of
the
liquor
store
in
the
radios?
