mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
contends
in
this
cause
if
by
no
stretch
of
existing
law
on
the
subject
can
the
known
facts
to
the
agents
at
the
time
they
stopped
the
motor
vehicle
constitute
probable
cause.
now,
the
government
takes
an
erroneous
comfort
in
the
use
of
the
word
“implicate”
as
to
the
defendant
pierotti
out
of
four
meanings
in
webster
and
they
have
utilized
webster
to
define
this
word,
they
have
ignored
the
innocent
connotations
of
the
word.
it
is
felt
that
pierotti
on
these
facts
is
entitled
to
this
meaning
to
involve
in
the
nature
or
operation
of
something
and
that
is
to
say
on
the
facts
that
pierotti
was
employed
as
a
dockman
for
a
concerned
which
was
involved
in
the
transshipment
of
the
--
of
articles
in
commerce.
now,
what
is
the
authority
of
a
federal
agent
under
the
statute
to
arrest
without
warrant?
the
section
which
is
quoted
in
the
brief
says
that
“an
agent
may
arrest
or
any
felony
cognizable
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
if
they
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
person
to
be
arrested
has
committed
or
is
committing
such
felony.”
now,
the
elements
are,
one,
that
it
must
be
a
federal
offense.
how
could
the
two
agents
in
observing
what
the
petitioner
and
his
codefendant
were
doing
on
the
streets
of
chicago
in
broad
daylight,
merely
moving
cartons
which
were
unrecognizable
in
any
shape
conclude
that
a
federal
offense
was
being
committed.
moreover,
it
must
be
a
felony.
now
these
cartons
were
not
large,
they
were
before
the
trial
court.
i
venture
to
say
that
the
question
of
the
value
of
$100
enters
into
the
picture
because
certainly
if
what
they
have
in
those
cartons
was
of
a
value
of
less
than
$100,
we
would
have
no
felony.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
the
night
before.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
the
night
before
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
now,
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
--
no,
sir.
no
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
the
words
were
that
he
was
implicated
in
interstate
shipments.
there
is
no
indication
of
implication
in
interstate
debts,
your
honor.
he
was
working
on
the
dock.
he
was
presently
employed
by
mr.
ziffron.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
draw
any
evil
connotation
from
that.
that's
the
testimony.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
i
don't
--
the
question
was
asked
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
the
answer
by
the
agent
was
yes.
i
don't
know
what
he
meant
and
that
point
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
believe
the
decision
discusses
what
is
meant
by
that.
i
think
that
mr.
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
there
may
have
been
an
objection.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
i'm
not
certain,
and
on
the
part
of
the
other
counsel
for
the
codefendant,
mr.
pierotti.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
well,
what
is
there
about
this
that
indicates
that
a
federal
offense
was
being
committed?
certainly,
there
were
no
markings
visible
on
the
cartons.
they
couldn't
even
tell
the
size.
i
believe
that
from
this,
the
agents
might
conclude
that
everyone
in
that
area
or
possibly
in
the
city
of
chicago
carried
a
carton,
was
a
suspect
of
a
federal
offense.
and
i
just
don't
believe
that
the
existing
law
on
that
subject
goes
that
far.
now,
size
has
a
bearing
on
value.
i
don't
know
how
much
whiskey
a
person
can
carry
in
one
trip.
i
would
say
probably
less
than
$100.
certainly
he
was
only
observed
carrying
carton
out
of
the
gangway
and
put
it
into
the
car.
now
illinois
law,
as
i
understand
it,
governs
the
question
of
arrest
without
warrant.
the
leading
case
in
illinois
is
people
versus
maryville.
i
am
very
sorry
to
state
to
the
court
that
the
citation
in
the
brief
is
an
error.
it's
276
and
not
236.
i'm
very
sorry
about
that.
i
discovered
that
last
night.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
276,
illinois
appellate
instead
of
236.
the
--
that
case
involved
a
man
walking
down
the
street
and
in
the
neighbor
when
someone
hollered
holdup
and
two
police
officers
seeing
this
man
walking
down
the
street
shouted
to
him
“stop.
put
up
your
hands,”
we're
police
officers.
and
as
he
raise
his
hands,
his
coat
raised
up
and
the
butt
of
a
pistol
stuck
out
from
his
trousers.
now,
the
--
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
he
was
charged
with
the
--
carrying
a
weapon.
the
court
held
and
i
stated
as
law
in
illinois
that
at
the
time
the
man
was
stopped
under
authority
of
the
law
with
intention
to
stop
him
and
they
restrained
his
locomotion
that
they
had
arrested
him.
a
subsequent
viewing
of
the
pistol
as
he
raised
his
hands
did
not
give
the
--
stopping
of
him
at
any
vitality.
they
state
that
the
most
characteristic
element
of
an
arrest
is
a
restraint
of
locomotion.
now,
in
this
area
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
there's
been
an
encroachment
upon
the
freedom
of
locomotion
which
started
out
with
the
carroll
case.
i
think
justice
mcneils
wrote
a
dissent
in
there
and
then
we
went
to
the
brinegar
case
in
which
mr.
justice
jackson
had
some
strong
words
on
how
far
you
can
go
in
the
search
and
stopping
of
an
automobile.
but
all
these
and
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
government
were
far
stronger
facts
where
the
case
is
cited
by
the
government
involved
alcohol
cases,
involved
loaded
cars,
known
bootleggers,
they
involved
narcotic
agents
with
informers,
they
involved
district
of
columbia
cases
where
the
district
police
also
have
some
traffic
supervision,
but
i
respectfully
state
to
this
court
that
there
isn't
even
a
strong
suspicion
of
evidence
and
--
evident
in
this
case
much
less
any
probably
cause.
i
think
inherent
in
this
case,
too
or
overtones
of
--
of
this
court's
decision
in
mallory.
now
the
mallory
case,
i
believe
the
court
said
that
the
rest
or
let's
take
that
if
the
court
feels
that
the
arrest
took
place
at
the
point
the
car
was
stopped,
then
--
which
was
the
stopping
of
the
petitioner's
freedom
of
locomotion
that
requires
the
next
step
is
arraignment.
i
think
there
are
overtones
of
this
same
proposition
to
be
found
in
mallory.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
oh
yes.
oh
yes,
your
honor.
because
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
--
they
asked
him
--
he
said
--
the
first
thing
he
said
was
after
(inaudible)
he
turned
around
to
the
codefendant
and
said
“tell
them
you
just
picked
me
up.”
now,
they
used
that
as
some
sort
of
a
lie.
actually
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
that's
right.
and
then
subsequently
they
questioned
him
and
he
denied
being
in
the
red
top
lounge.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
now,
i
feel
that
in
the
government's
brief,
they
point
out
these
elements
which
were
conversations
after
the
point
of
arrest
which
were
used
by
the
trial
court
to
convict
on
the
facts.
i
believe
that
those
statements
were
an
element
in
this
conviction.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
well
--
well
if
--
if
they
were
exculpatory
and
the
agents
said
they
did
see
him
in
front
of
the
tavern.
he's
been
caught
in
a
lie
and
certainly
to
that
extent,
if
he
denies
being
in
the
tavern,
the
court
might
take
that
into
consideration
in
assessing
guilt.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
i
would
like
to
mention
four
or
five
items
that
are
taken
up
in
the
government's
brief.
the
first
is
that
they
used
the
word
or
the
expression
unsuccessful
attempt
to
catch
up.
i
would
like
this
court
to
understand
that
in
this
matter
there
is
absolutely
no
question
of
pursuit.
it
was
a
question
of
trailing
and
they
took
the
long
way
around
and
lost
them.
there
is
no
pursuit
involved
in
this
case.
i
note
that
the
words
indirect
route
is
used.
the
only
more
direct
route
to
where
they
were
going
would
have
been
to
make
a
u-turn
which
in
many
portions
of
chicago
is
illegal.
they
went
around
the
block.
now,
as
a
further
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
sir?
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
well,
they
were
--
they
took
the
wrong
block,
that's
all
and
then
they
came
back
and
went
up
to
the
right
alley,
but
the
second
time
they
went
up
to
the
right
alley.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
suspicious
about
picking
a
wrong
alley.
only
a
block
away,
you
start
up
an
alley
and
see
it's
the
wrong
one,
turn
around
and
go
out
the
--
along
the
next
block.
i
don't
see
anything
suspicious
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
well,
any
-
it's
2
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
i
would
imagine
any
mistake
in
motors
shouldn't
be
regarded
as
suspicious.
you
make
a
wrong
turn,
you
back
up
and
turn
around
and
go
other
way.
i
can
see
nothing
suspicious
in
the
conduct
of
the
defendants
in
the
use
of
that
vehicle.
they
also
make
the
statement
in
the
brief.
it
is
evident
that
the
cartons
would
be
removed
from
the
car
just
as
it
previous
loaded
there.
now,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
the
cartons
that
were
placed
in
there
were
ever
removed.
there
is
no
examination
of
the
car
at
any
point
and
they
talk
about
delivery
of
merchandise
to
a
liquor
store.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
delivery
of
those
cartons.
even
assuming
there
were
empty
beer
bottles
going
back
to
a
tavern,
which
they
weren't
and
which
there's
no
evidence
of,
i
see
nothing
suspicious
in
those
circumstances.
the
other
theory
that
the
petitioner
makes
in
this
case
is
that
there's
been
an
improper
interpretation
of
the
so-called
presumption,
the
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
goods
will
authorize
conviction.
very
briefly,
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
facts
alone
explain
his
possession
such
as
it
was.
he
was
a
passenger
in
a
vehicle.
there
isn't
any
quest
that
he
met
pierotti
by
a
chance.
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
knew
these
were
stolen
or
anything
about
it.
the
car
was
borrowed.
he
was
in
it.
he
was
in
it
when
the
car
was
stopped.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
law
requires
that
the
defendant
take
the
stand
and
do
at
which
he's
already
done
by
his
plea
of
guilty.
the
circumstances
alone
explain
and
are
just
as
reasonable
so
far
as
his
innocence
is
concern
as
they
are
with
guilt
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances
that
on
the
motion
for
judgment
of
the
acquittal,
they
court
below
should
have
find
him
not
guilty.
for
all
these
reasons
and
two
points,
the
petitioner
respectfully
urges
that
the
decisions
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
bear
with
me,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
very
briefly,
the
--
i
want
to
correct
one
point.
counsel
here
said
that
the
--
was
stipulated
that
the
whiskey
was
in
interstate
commerce.
the
stipulation
(inaudible)
there
was
no
proof
on
the
whiskey.
secondly,
i
want
to
point
out
an
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
pierotti
was
a
present
employer.
now,
how
could
–-
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
--
a
present
employee
of
zifran.
now
i
don't
know
what
mr.
liebermann
said,
he
--
but
certainly
he
wouldn't
have
a
criminal
or
someone
who
had
just
stolen
something
the
night
before
in
his
employ
that
morning.
i
can't
think
that
any
evil
connotation
must
be
placed
on
that.
i
think
the
next
fallacy
in
the
government's
argument
is
that
they
assume
that
the
cartons
went
into
the
liquor
store.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever,
but
that
the
cartons
did
not
remain
in
the
vehicle.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
the
other
point
was
that
in
the
case
of
the
time
magazine
article
in
the
beef,
i
think
that
any
officer,
traffic
officer
has
a
right
to
inquire
into
the
use
for
whether
or
not
a
person
driving
a
vehicle
is
under
a
licensed
authority
is
all
there
up
to
drive
it.
now,
those
cases
are
legit.
i
believe
the
district
of
columbia
case,
the
bell
case
here,
police
officer
saw
a
car
driving
down
the
street
with
no
lights
on.
they
stopped
the
car
and
when
they
look
at
it,
they
found
cigarettes
in
the
rear
of
the
car.
the
court
there
held,
the
district
or
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
district
held
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
stop
the
car
for
the
traffic
violation.
but
i
can
see
nothing
in
this
case
--
it
isn't
even
a
--
it's
hardly
even
an
(inaudible)
much
less
a
suspicion
and
i
think
that
to
(inaudible)
in
the
expression,
my
wife
is
a
pineapple
but
[laughter]
--
give
me
an
ankle
but
i
don't
think
you
have
probable
cause
in
this
case.
