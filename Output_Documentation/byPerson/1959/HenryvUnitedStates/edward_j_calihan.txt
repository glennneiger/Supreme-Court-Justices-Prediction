mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner,
john
patrick
henry
in
this
cause
was
convicted
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
of
a
violation
of
section
659
title
18
united
states
code
of
the
unlawful
possession
of
three
cartons
of
transistor
radios
of
a
value
of
an
excess
of
$100.
prior
to
the
trial,
a
motion
to
suppress
was
made.
the
motion
was
denied.
the
motion
was
then
amended
and
again
denied.
the
plaintiff
and
his
co-defendant,
one
albert
pierotti,
waved
a
jury
trial.
they
were
tied
by
the
district
court,
and
after
the
government's
evidence
was
concluded,
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
was
made
and
denied.
the
defendants
both
the
petitioner,
john
patrick
henry
and
his
co-defendant
albert
pierotti
offered
no
defense.
they
were
convicted,
both
appealed,
the
court
affirmed
and
the
2-to-1
decision,
a
dissent
having
been
written.
pierotti
is
not
with
this
any
longer.
he
dropped
out
of
the
cause.
now,
in
this
case,
there
are
two
questions
presented,
and
they
were
also
presented
below.
first
one
is
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
permit
the
stopping
of
an
individual
riding
in
a
motor
vehicle
on
a
public
highway
detention
and
questioning
of
said
individual,
search
of
the
vehicle
in
which
he
is
riding
as
a
passenger,
physical
deprivation
of
his
freedom
of
movement
without
such
conduct
constituting
arrest.
any
effect
developed
by
the
officers
after
the
stopping
of
the
motor
vehicle
not
just
to
file
or
give
validity
to
the
act
of
stopping.
the
second
point
is
that
the
evidence
is
not
of
sufficient
weight
as
a
matter
of
law
to
support
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
where
the
courts
below
relied
principally
upon
an
improper
interpretation
of
a
so-called
presumption
that
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
goods
will
authorize
a
conviction.
now,
the
facts
are
that
on
may
the
13th
of
1957,
the
petitioner,
john
patrick
henry
was
drinking
in
a
bar
called
phil's
tavern.
at
about
12
o'clock,
the
--
a
government
witness
asked
him
if
he
knew
where
he
could
get
a
bet
down
on
a
horse.
it
was
a
bad
day,
and
the
government
witness
loaned
the
petitioner,
john
patrick
henry,
his
automobile.
meantime,
the
co-defendant
who
was
a
duct
worker
for
zephirine
tracklines
had
sometime
in
the
foreknown
and
independently
of
the
petitioner
handled
some
transistor
radios
which
were
moving
across
the
duct
as
a
part
of
an
interstate
shipment.
somehow
unbeknownst
to
anyone,
mr.
pierotti
managed
to
get
three
cartons
of
these
radios
off
of
the
duct.
now,
this
is
preliminary.
i
give
you
the
background
of
each
of
the
activities
of
the
two
defendants
for
a
purpose.
there
were
two
agents,
two
fbi
agents,
federal
bureau
of
investigation
agents
patrolling
the
area
together
with
three
or
four
other
units.
it
appeared
that
the
night
before
a
whiskey
loss
in
the
amount
of
some
$50,000
has
been
incurred.
apparently,
a
truck
was
stolen
from
the
hayes
motor
truck
service
and
the
agents
where
in
the
area
seeking
leads
to
the
whiskey
loss.
they
observed
john
patrick
henry,
the
petitioner,
and
pierotti
come
out
of
another
saloon
where
apparently
the
petitioner
had
gone
in
his
effort
to
get
a
bet
on
a
horse.
they
saw
him
come
out
of
the
saloon
and
saw
them
get
into
the
ford
automobile
which
had
been
loaned
to
the
petitioner.
both
the
petitioner
and
pierotti
drove
south
to
the
end
of
the
block
around
the
corner
to
the
right
west,
around
the
next
corner
to
the
right
north
and
then
proceeded
two
blocks
north
to
another
corner
where
they
turned
west.
the
agents
then
observed
their
first
attempt
to
go
into
an
alley
two
blocks
west
of
that
north
street
but
apparently
a
mistake
had
been
made
and
they
came
back
a
block
and
turned
into
an
alley
about
a
block
west
of
the
return
street.
the
defendants
proceeded
about
300
feet
up
into
the
alley
going
north
and
the
agents
still
following
them
stopped
short
of
the
alley
and
agent
oitszinger
or
stadtmiller
got
out
of
the
vehicle
and
observed
or
took
a
look
up
the
alley.
they
observed
henry
who
was
riding
as
a
passenger
get
out
of
the
ford
automobile
going
into
a
gangway
and
few
minutes
later,
returned
with
some
cartons.
now,
the
agents
admitted
that
they
could
not,
in
any
way,
identify
those
cartons
or
their
size,
shape
or
anything.
the
petitioner
put
the
cartons
in
the
vehicle,
got
back
into
the
automobile
and
pierotti
drove
to
the
end
of
the
alley
and
turned
out
of
it
heading
back
in
an
easterly
direction.
the
agents
did
not
proceed
through
the
alley
but
went
further
west
to
another
street
in
an
effort
to
proceed
around
the
block
and
by
the
time
they
had
gotten
around
the
block,
they
missed
the
two
defendants
who
were
in
the
ford.
after
looking
about,
they
returned
to
the
vicinity
of
the
red
top
lounge
and
they
saw
the
motor
vehicle.
now,
they
did
not
see
any
movement
of
cartons
from
the
ford
into
the
red
top
lounge.
after
a
few
minutes,
the
petitioner
john
patrick
henry
and
pierotti
emerged
from
the
red
top
lounge,
got
back
into
the
ford
automobile
and
made
the
same
trip
around
the
block,
back
two
blocks
and
over
into
the
alley.
and
again,
the
agents
followed
them
and
again,
alighted
from
their
vehicle
at
the
mouth
of
the
alley
and
observed
the
defendant
or
petitioner,
henry,
go
through
the
same
activity.
and
again,
they
could
not
identify
the
cartons'
size,
shape
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
cross-examination,
agent
admitted
that
he
didn't
know
whether
there
was
a
carton
of
groceries.
but
in
any
event,
after
the
petitioner,
pierotti,
again
got
back
into
the
ford
automobile
and
again
proceeded
out
of
the
alley
and
headed
east,
the
agents
for
the
second
time,
attempted
to
go
around
the
block
and
again,
missed
the
agents.
they
travelled
several
streets
and
finally
observed
the
petitioner,
john
patrick
henry,
and
pierotti
coming
down
a
street
in
the
vicinity
and
they
were
approaching
from
an
opposite
direction,
the
agents
were,
a
two-way
street.
immediately
upon
seeing
the
ford
vehicle
in
which
the
petitioner
was
riding
still
as
a
passenger,
they
pulled
directly
in
front
of
the
ford
and
with
their
hands
out
of
the
windows
motioned
head
on
for
the
vehicle
in
which
the
petitioner
was
riding,
stopped.
the
agents
then
motioned
to
both
defendants
and
they
got
out
of
the
automobile.
now,
there
is
only
one
other
factor
in
this
case
so
far
as
the
agents
are
concerned.
the
agents
said
that
they
knew
john
patrick
henry,
the
petitioner,
no
more,
no
less,
and
that
they
had
been
advised
that
the
--
that
albert
pierotti
was
implicated
in
interstate
shipments,
no
more,
no
less.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
implicated
by
--
yes,
they
said
that
they
received
that
information
from
pierotti's
present
employer.
pierotti
was
working
for
a
company
which
handled
interstate
shipments.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
the
agents
testified
on
the
motion
--
the
agent
testified
to
the
motion
to
suppress
and
there
was
a
stipulation
if
the
other
agent
would
also
testify
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
--
substances.
then
on
the
trial,
the
other
one
who
testified,
and
there
was
a
stipulation
that
--
there
--
there
is
no
substantial
dispute
in
--
in
the
facts
here.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
yes,
the
same
facts
were
testified.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
implicated
in
interstate
shipments.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
not
on
any
of
--
not
any
crime
involving
interstate
shipment
which
is
a
point,
of
course,
that
the
dissenting
judge
may
not
have
liked
to
deal
with
that
later.
now
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
no.
but
immediately
upon
the
vehicle
being
stopped
in
his
head
on
manner,
the
petitioner,
henry,
get
out
of
his
side
and
--
and
the
defendant
albert
pierotti
got
on
his
side
and
henry
said,
“hold
it,
it's
the
gee.”
now,
the
agents
got
out
of
the
vehicle,
walked
over
and
looked
into
the
ford
and
saw
the
cartons
in
question.
after
some
conversation
with
pierotti
and
the
--
and
the
petitioner,
one
of
the
agents
says,
“there's
something
wrong
here.
let's
go
down
to
the
office.”
about
three
hours
later,
they
had
determined
that
the
--
the
radios
were
stolen
and
as
the
agent
then
stand
on
this
record,
we
formally
placed
them
under
arrest.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
substantial
--
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
there's
--
yes,
“there
--
there's
something
wrong
here,
let's
go
down
to
the
office.”
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
yes,
that's
on
the
record.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
no.
no,
your
honor.
they
knew
that
this
were
fbi
agents.
and
i
think
that
in
--
in
keeping
with
what
the
court
has
said
in
(inaudible),
i
don't
think
they
had
to
risk
being
shot
or
otherwise
manhandled.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
no,
they
just
went
down.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
now,
your
honor,
on
the
argument
in
the
seventh
circuit,
counsel
for
the
government
admitted
that
at
the
time
the
vehicle
is
stopped,
the
arrest
occurred,
but
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
at
variance
with
that.
now,
we
contended
that
--
that
there
was
not
probable
cause
to
stop
that
vehicle,
and
i
think
that
inferentially,
in
the
court's
opinion,
they
recognize
that,
because
they
have
set
up
two
standards.
at
page
85
of
the
--
of
the
transcript,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
“but
it
is
clear
that
here
the
facts
within
the
agent's
knowledge
amount
to
more
than
mere
suspicion
and
passed
it
to
probable
cause
for
their
action
and
stopping
the
appellants'
car.
the
arrest
and
taking
into
custody
of
appellants
followed
the
discovery
of
the
cartons
of
radios
bearing
the
shipping
labels
indicating
that
they
were
part
of
an
interstate
shipment
and
the
far
from
satisfactory
explanation
by
the
appellants
in
regard
to
the
ownership
of
the
cartons.”
oh,
that's
where
we
partly
come.
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
if
they
didn't
have
probable
cause
when
that
vehicle
was
stopped
by
the
head
on
activity
of
the
fbi
automobile,
they
didn't
acquire
it
later
by
the
discovery
of
the
cartons
and
the
far
from
satisfactory
import.
and
i
think
that's
completely
consistent
with
this
court's
ruling,
and
it
is
certainly
consistent
with
what
the
state
of
illinois
has
held.
and
it
is
my
understanding
also
from
this
court's
decision
that
in
an
arrest
without
warrant,
the
law
where
the
arrest
takes
place
has
some
governing
application.
mr.
edward
j.
calihan,
jr.
thank
you.
