justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now,
does
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
just
thought
to
ask
whether
this
was
with
a
prohibition
against
the
condemnation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
also
a
form
of
taking
it,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
is
there
any
difference
between
practically
--
basically
speaking
are
you
saying
that
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
take
it
by
eminent
domain
but
they
have
a
right
to
license
it
in
some
way
so
they
would
pay
differently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
practically
speaking
when
--
i
haven't
quite
understood
it
here,
is
there
any
dispute
here
with
the
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
difference
of
relative
money
would
go
directly
to
the
indians
or
whether
it
was
those
of
the
secretary
of
interior?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
either
instance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
real
bone
of
contention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
only
issue
was,
wasn't
it,
is
really
as
to
whether
they
have
the
power
to
condemn
in
the
state
before
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
meant
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i
meant
was
if
that's
the
only
thing
i
should
say
congress
(inaudible)
to
condemn,
there's
no
problem
with
this
to
condemn,
i
mean
just
as
congress
wouldn't
have
the
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
there
hasn't
been
effort
made
to
get
that
way
that
you're
arguing?
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
get
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap),
but
what
about
(b)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
do
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
they
do
not
do
that
--
suppose
they
do
not
do
that,
is
it
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
--
without
imposing
those
conditions
--
following
those
conditions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
power
commission
shall
include
among
the
licensing
condition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
yes,
suppose
they
did
not
include
whatever
conditions
are
required
just
to
get
section
10.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
issued
it
without
complying
with
those
conditions,
is
it
valid
or
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
section
--
but
section
(e)
says
include
among
the
licensing
condition
in
addition
to
those
being
necessary,
i
assume
that
complies
10
(e),
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
10.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
10.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
one
that
says
that
in
this
make
finding,
suppose
that
apply.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
is
the
condition
and
they
didn't
comply
with
it,
is
it
valid
or
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
the
conclusion
in
my
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
one
disagreed
with
you
on
that,
does
that
end
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
it
doesn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
only
licensing
conditions
of
the
federal
power
act
are
those
that
are
claimed
in
10
(e)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
10,
section
10.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
section
10.
