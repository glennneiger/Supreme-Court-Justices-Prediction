mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
involves
the
right
of
the
new
york
power
authority
to
take
the
lands
of
the
tuscarora
indian
reservation
to
carry
out
a
project
licensed
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
connection
with
the
niagara
river
development.
in
order
to
fully
understand
the
problems
that
had
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
commission
and
the
courts
below,
we
have
to
turn
back
shortly
to
the
situation
as
it
was
before
1950,
when
the
treaty
involved
in
this
development
was
executed
between
the
parties,
canada
and
the
united
states.
at
that
--
under
the
old
agreements
between
the
two
countries,
the
provision
was
that
canada
should
--
should
have
the
right
to
use
36,000
cubic
feet
per
second
for
hydroelectric
power
and
the
united
states,
20,000
cubic
feet
per
second
for
such
development.
this
gave
canada
a
very
distinct
advantage
and
the
united
states
was
eager
to
have
a
--
an
equal
share
in
the
waters
of
the
niagara
river
for
hydroelectric
purposes.
so
that
a
new
treaty
was
negotiated
and
finally
executed
in
1950,
which
provided
that
each
country
would
have
an
equal
share
of
the
waters.
but
it
also
specifically
provided
for
protection
of
the
scenic
attractions
in
the
niagara
falls
area
and
required
that
a
certain
number
of
cubic
feet
per
second
be
released
during
certain
hours
of
the
day
running
from
morning
until
--
rather,
early
evening
during
the
tourist
season
and
a
reduction
during
the
month
of
october
to
a
slightly
lower
amount.
the
niagara
mohawk
power
company,
a
private
power
development
had
a
schoellkopf
works
so
called,
on
the
river
which
was
using
the
power
under
the
old
agreement,
and
also,
it
was
called
the
adams
works
which
was
largely
obsolete.
and
they
had
been
draw
--
having
the
use
of
the
project
waters
prior
to
the
controversy
involved
here.
from
1950
to
1957,
the
united
--
the
congress
was
unable
to
arrive
at
any
agreement
to
develop
the
united
states'
share
of
this
water,
because
of
many
conflicts
that
developed
in
the
congress.
one
of
the
principle
ones
was
the
issue
whether
it
would
be
done
by
private
power
or
public
power
interest.
and
that
controversy
flared
for
those
--
practically
that
entire
period.
it
was
also
the
question
of
whether
there
would
be
a
preference
for
cooperatives
and
municipalities
which
is
not
provided
for
under
the
federal
power
act,
and
whether
adjacent
states
would
be
able
to
get
a
share
of
this
power.
finally,
the
schoellkopf
works
that
were
operated
by
the
private
power
interest,
niagara
mohawk,
fell
into
the
river
in
1956,
in
the
middle
of
a
summer
and
that
precipitated
actions
so
that
the
congress
was
able
to
resolve
the
whole
thing
very
rapidly.
and
they
passed
what
is
known
as
a
public
law
85-159.
now,
this
law
was
different
than
many
of
the
acts
of
the
congress
in
this
area,
because
in
it,
congress
deliberately
and
carefully
tried
to
resolve
the
great
issues
that
had
been
troubling
both
sides
of
the
controversy's
purport.
and
it
first
prescribed
in
definite
terms
that
the
new
york
power
authority
would
develop
this
power
and
which
should
be
--
should
receive
a
license.
it
also
provided
that
the
license
should
be
granted
under
that
act,
85-159,
and
not
the
federal
power
act.
it
provided
that
there
would
be
a
preference
as
to
the
power
for
the
municipalities
and
cooperatives
of
50%
of
all
of
the
power
that
was
developed
in
the
project.
and
that
20%
of
that
50%
would
be
made
available
to
adjacent
states
that
is
--
it
was
contemplated
and
were
not
spelled
out
to
ohio
and
pennsylvania.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it
said
so
in
so
many
words.
it
also
says
that
the
grant
shall
be
made
by
conforming
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
federal
power
commission.
but,
if
there
should
be
any
conflict
between
the
two,
that
conflict
should
be
resolved
by
the
superseding
of
the
new
law,
the
85-159,
over
the
act.
and
that
is
in
expressed
terms.
i
think
you
might
wish
to
turn
to
that
on
page
79
of
the
government's
brief,
federal
power
commission,
section
2
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
license
issued
under
the
terms
of
this
act
shall
be
granted
in
conformance
with
rules
of
practice
and
procedure
of
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
that
is
in
--
in
conformance
with
that
law
to
see
it
distinguishes
between
the
law
and
the
rules
of
practice
and
procedure
of
the
federal
power
commission.
but
in
the
event
of
any
conflict,
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
govern
in
respect
with
the
project
herein
authorized.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
position
of
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
of
the
federal
power
commission.
but
i
think
the
language
itself
is
open
to
the
interpretation
that
if
there
is
any
conflict
with
regard
to
the
federal
power
--
federal
rules
--
or
federal
power
commission's
rules
of
the
practice
and
procedure
that
that
conflict
shall
be
resolved.
and
then
the
act
itself
says
that
this
grant
shall
be
under
this
particular
act,
so
it
defines
exactly
what
the
nature
of
this
grant
shall
be.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
that
the
act
in
its
nature
in
the
fact
that
it
took
seven
years
developing
it,
tried
to
resolve
that
this
act
would
control
any
conflicts
with
any
legislation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
is
a
correct
reading
of
the
section.
i
think
that
the
history
shows
that
congress
was
trying
to
resolve
all
questions
where
there
was
a
conflict.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
except
that
the
congress
did
contemplate
that
the
federal
power
commission
would
issue
the
license
and
it
would
use
its
rules
and
regulations,
and
so,
i
think
you
do
have
to
have
some
reasons
to
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
there
was
a
further
provision
to
take
care
of
this
schoellkopf
plant
and
the
private
power
development
there,
the
niagara
mohawk,
that
they
will
be
forming
45,000
kilowatts
that
would
be
supplied
to
niagara
mohawk
and
that
they
should
try
to
see
that
the
industrial
developments
had
been
relying
upon
this
low
cost
power
would
get
that
power
at
the
rates
--
low
rates
that
they
had
previously.
and
that
the
rates
would
be
regulated
by
the
power
authority.
they
would
have
the
right
to
build
transmission
lines
to
the
various
places
that
they
sold
the
power
and
that
the
rates
for
the
power
on
resale
should
be
the
lowest
reasonable
rates
that
they
could
obtain.
in
presenting
this
to
the
congress
over
the
seven-year
period,
the
reservoir
was
--
generally
was
throughout
the
period
located
at
the
same
point
as
is
now
in
conflict.
but
due
to
this
--
the
difference,
the
change
brought
about
by
the
schoellkopf
disaster
in
1956.
the
share
of
the
power
authority
of
the
water
had
to
be
increased
and
therefore,
the
reservoir
in
order
to
use
all
of
the
share
of
the
united
states
of
the
water
from
niagara
river.
the
act
itself
is
explicit
in
that
the
power
commission's
license
should
provide
and
print
it,
so
that
the
power
authority,
in
this
license,
should
use
all,
and
i
emphasize
“all”,
of
the
share
of
the
united
states
of
the
water
of
the
niagara
river.
congress
was
explicit
that
the
plants
that
were
developed
and
the
license
would
use
every
drop
of
this
water
that
was
the
united
states'
share.
and
that
is,
it's
particularly
clear
in
this
case
because
prior
to
that
time,
all
it
got
through
the
law,
it
contemplated
that
niagara
mohawk
would
get
enough
of
the
water
to
handle
the
same
share
of
the
power
development
that
it
had
done
as
a
private
development
before.
but
with
the
disaster
of
falling
into
the
river,
they
decided
to
turn
it
all
over
to
the
public
power
authority
of
new
york
and
that
it
should
use
all
of
the
water
that
was
the
united
states'
share.
now,
mere
presentations
of
how
this
would
be
done,
they
--
they
have
the
benefit
of
the
bureau
of
power
or
the
federal
power
authority
back
in
1949
in
which
it
developed
how
this
should
be
done
and
located
the
reservoir
at
the
same
general
point,
recommending
a
22,000
acre-foot
--
acre-feet
reservoir
at
that
point.
and
then
they
referred
it
to
the
corps
of
engineers
for
its
recommendation
and
the
corps
of
engineers
came
up
with
a
30,000
acre-foot
reservoir
at
the
same
point.
and
then,
the
new
york
power
authority,
before
the
schoellkopf
disaster
and
they
were
given
the
additional
water,
recommended
one
of
41,000
acre-feet
at
the
same
point.
now,
it
was
clearly
the
congress,
throughout
this
whole
period
when
these
committees
met
time
after
time
in
regard
to
this
matter
and
studied
the
project
that
there
had
to
be
a
pump-generating
reservoir
and
pump-generating
plant
in
order
use
these
waters
properly,
because
there
are
--
when
the
peak
demand
is
during
the
daylight
hours
through
the
week
and
over
the
weekend
and
during
the
night
time
hours,
there
isn't
a
demand
for
the
power.
so,
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
for
the
people
of
the
country
in
that
area
of
the
greatest
production
of
power
possible,
they
devised
the
--
and
all
these
--
there
is
no
controversy
between
the
engineers
as
to
doing
this.
there
was
a
general
agreement
by
all
of
them
that
presented
anything,
that
this
was
the
way
to
take
the
greatest
advantage
of
this
water
development
on
the
niagara
river
and
produce
the
most
power
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
in
the
area.
now,
this
is
the
niagara
river
and
this
is
the
fall,
and
this
is
the
schoellkopf
plant
that
fell
into
the
river.
and
here
is
the
water
intake.
that's
where
they
take
out
of
the
river
down
this
conduit
near
the
railroad
yard.
we'll
come
into
the
controversy
later
down
here
along
the
conduit,
and
here
is
the
proposed
reservoir.
there
is
no
issue
about
this
particular
area.
this
is
the
portion
of
the
tuscarora
reservation
that's
in
issue,
13,083
acres.
this
is
the
scaffold
for
the
--
the
land
falls
away
sharply
150
to
200
feet
and
this
--
it
slopes
down
through
this
area
and
this
is
all
the
gulf,
it
would
be
like
(inaudible).
and
i'll
tell
you
why
this
can't
be
used
for
the
reservoir
as
stated.
here,
the
pump-generating
plant,
and
that
device
is
a
very
expensive
and
elaborate
one,
but
in
principle,
it
involves
the
running
of
the
water
through
generators.
and
then,
also,
these
generators
can
be
reversed
and
have
pumps
on
them
to
push
the
water
during
the
period
that
they
can't
use
it
for
the
greatest
advantage
to
produce
electricity
because
of
the
demand
into
this
reservoir.
and
then
take
the
water
back
at
the
times
that
they
can
use
it
and
run
it
down
here
through
this
generating
plant
and
through
this,
the
general
generating
plant,
to
get
the
highest
production
possible.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
didn't
say
what
the
alternative
lands
were
in
the
first
time.
and
they
finally
said
that
they
--
there
were
no
alternative
lands
that
were
feasible,
either
engineering
wise
or
otherwise.
it
was
just
in
the
first
time
before
that
matter
was
sent
back
to
them
when
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
when
--
mr.
justice,
and
when
it
--
it
came
back
after
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
to
them,
they
determined
the
question
of
interference
under
4
(e).
they
then
examined
four
different
possibilities
of
reservoirs
in
the
area
making
sure
that
none
of
them
were
feasible
engineering
wise
or
otherwise,
economically
and
community
disruptions.
and
therefore,
that
the
only
place
that
it
could
be
put
was
on
the
reservation
and
if
they
couldn't
do
that,
they
would
have
to
reduce
it
accordingly.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it's
--
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
they
examined
exhaustively
on
the
return
--
remand
of
the
matter
to
see
whether
the
other
places
were
practical
and
the
other
places
--
at
first,
they
didn't
consider
anything
in
here.
there's
a
very
elaborate
airport
development
there.
they
didn't
consider
anything
down
in
the
industrial
area
or
in
the
main
part
of
niagara
falls,
as
it
means
taking
large
parts
of
the
city,
or
in
part
--
but
they
did
consider
all
of
this
area
and
four
different
one
that
extended
up
here
probably.
four
different
projects
among
that
came
over
in
here
has
been
thought.
as
--
and
they
concluded
that
the
--
there's
just
wasn't
any
feasibility
engineering
wise
and
that
they
were
so
costly
that
it
was
impractical
and
also
that
they
put
this
reservoir
in
here
that
it
would
cut
the
city
of
lewiston
into
two
pieces
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
destroy
their
whole
sewage
and
water
and
environment
program
and
everything
else.
so,
that
they
did
examine
very
carefully
the
various
possibilities.
they
also
considered
a
plan
that
came
down
here
in
this
slope
area.
when
they
get
down
here
in
the
slope
area,
that
is
considerably
lower
and
some
of
that
would
be
discharged,
because
the
whole
series
of
pump-generating
reservoir
is
that
you
pump
it
up
on
an
elevation.
and
then
you
use
gravity
to
let
it
flow
down
through
the
generators
and
produce
the
electricity.
and
when
you
get
down
here
on
some
of
these
slope,
it's
down
at
a
level
where
it
doesn't
contribute
anything
to
the
fall
or
the
header
--
hydro
when
electric
engineers
speak
of
it.
and
therefore,
it
gets
no
benefit
of
that
and
it's
just
as
though
you
had
so
much
level
ground
there
that
if
you'd
pour
the
water
on,
you
try
to
hold
it
there,
and
then
you
have
to
get
to
head
from
the
rest
of
the
water,
so
that
you
lose
all
of
the
benefit
of
that
water
as
far
as
producing
electricity.
now,
the
commission
also
concluded
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
60,000
acre-feet
of
reservoir
in
order
to
fully
use
the
united
states'
share.
and
that
determination
was
made
by
them
after
this
exhaustive
hearing.
now,
the
question
probably
occurs
to
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
congress
had
brought
to
its
attention
in
explicit
terms
whether
this
would
take
the
tuscarora
reservation
lands.
and
we
--
we
do
not
think
that
as
far
as
the
federal
power
commission
is
concerned
that
it
did
that
it
--
we
think
it's
there
by
implication
that
from
--
and
i'll
try
to
develop
that,
but
it
was
not
on
any
of
the
maps
shown
this
is
tuscarora
or
tuscarora
written
over
to
show
that
the
reservoir
as
proposed
would
extend
over
the
tuscarora
indian
reservation
lands.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
did
not.
they
referred
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
made
provision
for
reservoirs
in
this
area
because
it
was
smaller
at
that
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
at
first,
they
made
provision
for
one
--
the
bureau
of
power
made
one
for
20,000
acre-feet.
and
then,
the
corps
of
engineers
recommended
one
for
32,000.
that's
before
schoellkopf
and
before
they
would
get
all
the
water.
and
then
when
the
new
york
power
authority
made
recommendation
for
41,000.
and
that
was
before
schoellkopf.
but,
at
the
time
of
the
new
york
power
authority,
they
did
describe
it
with
particularity
in
this
regard.
they
didn't
say
tuscarora.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
new
york
power
authority
in
they're
showing
and
their
engineers.
they
didn't
say
that
it
would
be
bounded
by
the
witmer
road
here,
that
this
road
out
here
to
the
south.
so
you
won't
be
confused,
in
this
mop
--
map,
north
was
over
here.
it's
an
unusual
map
in
that
way,
but
that's
where
the
north
was
under
this
map
according
to
engineers.
and,
so
this
was
in
the
south
border,
which
is
described,
which
is
also
described
that
it
would
be
bordered
by
military
road
on
this
side
and
that
it
would
run
to
the
tuscarora
reservation.
that's
for
the
41,000
acre-feet.
well,
then,
the
congress
considered
the
fact
that
in
--
after
the
schoellkopf
disaster,
they
would
have
to
be
--
the
new
york
power
authority
would
be
given
all
the
water
then.
there
would
have
to
be
a
larger
reservoir
according
to
all
of
the
showing
by
the
engineers
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
full
share
of
the
united
states.
and,
the
only
implication
would
be
that
it
would
have
to
take
some
of
the
tuscarora
reservation,
because
it
was
up
to
it
at
that
time
from
the
showing
made.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
because
it
was
contemplated
that
under
the
first
--
under
the
law
up
to
that
time
that
congress
was
considering
that
some
20,000
cubic-feet
per
second
would
be
given
to
schoellkopf
plant,
because
they
had
--
up
to
that
time
niagara
mohawk
could
have
that
share.
and
therefore,
they
would
run
it
through
this
plant
and
the
new
york
power
authority
just
wouldn't
have
that
much
water
to
come
down
to
this
conduit
and
run
through
this
so
that
you
have
much
water
to
put
in
the
reservoir
and
you
have
--
in
order
to
make
full
usage
of
what
congress
was
going
to
allow.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
it
during
the
17
hours
that
they
figured
for
the
dependable
power
when
they
have
this
load
of
use
when
people
wanted
the
power,
they
had
to
have
more
space
to
hold
this
water
back
during
the
hours
that
they
didn't
--
people
didn't
want
the
power
and
because
of
this
additional
20,000
cubic-feet.
and
that
meant,
they
had
to
have
a
larger
reservoir
and
there
is
a
detailed
showing
the
engineers
made
of
the
peak
hours
and
how
you
would
--
during
the
seven
hours
of
the
day,
you
keep
pumping
it
up
into
this
reservoir
and
during
the
weekends,
you
pump
it
up
and
they
showed
just
how
it
levels
off
so
that
you
get
the
highest
possible
production
which
congress
described,
there
were
1,800,000
kilowatts
during
the
17
hours
of
dependable
power.
that's
how
they
described
it
as
being
done
by
the
committee.
and
the
committee
said
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
pump-generating
plant
and
a
pump-generating
reservoir
in
precise
words.
and
that's
all
that
was
ever
considered
for
seven
years
about
this
matter.
now
the
difference
that's
involved
is
that
at
first,
people
were
considering
that
the
new
york
power
authority
couldn't
have
it
all,
because
it
would
be
unfair
to
take
it
away
from
niagara
mohawk,
but
they'd
have
all
the
time
and
this
was
expensive
plant
therefore
and
not
give
them
shares,
so
they
would
get
their
share
of
20,000
and
then
the
rest
of
it
with
new
york
power
authority.
and
then
it
didn't
take
as
large.
and
it's
clear
that
up
to
that
time,
they
were
told
that
it
would
be
this
smaller
reservoir,
but
the
new
york
power
authority
even
then
told
exactly
what
it
was
and
that
it
is
extended
to
the
tuscarora
reservoir.
and
then,
it's
clear
that
the
congress
increased
the
amount,
said,
they'd
get
all
the
water.
they
would
use
every
bit
of
it,
and
that
they
could
only
do
it
by
the
larger
reservoir
and
congress
contemplated
the
larger
reservoir
under
the
act
that
it
could.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that's
right
from
the
history
of
it.
there
was
apparently
the
opposition
in
as
to
whether
the
private
power
or
public
power
would
do
it
and
it
went
down
in
--
and
they
were
to
get
their
full
share
out
of
this
without
having
to
put
the
industrial
units,
so
i
don't
see
why
they
--
they
weren't
pretty
well
satisfied.
but
that's
my
own
conclusion
from
history.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
they're
very
elaborate
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
came
down
sort
of
to
the
last,
when
everything
--
all
the
contest
was
falling
out
of
the
way
and
everybody
seemed
to
agree
that
this
project
would
be
entirely
brought
by
the
power
authority
and
that
it
had
to
be
used
all
the
--
it
was
always
contemplated
that
that
they'd
use
all
the
water
of
the
united
states'
share.
and
that
was
the
whole
thing
about
the
treaty
that
you
try
to
get
a
better
division
of
this
water
that
--
when
they
got
down
to
that
point,
they
expressly
said,
they
should
have
1,800,000
dependable
power
in
17
hours.
and
it
was
just
assumed
by
everybody
that
it
would
--
the
reservoir
would
just
be
extended
and
so,
with
all
the
detail,
nobody
went
into
the
question
of
the
indians.
now,
there
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
came
up
first
in
regard
to
the
senators
which
is
not
this
controversy.
and
before
one
of
the
committees
of
congress,
the
senators
came
in
and
said,
this
project
would
generally
interfere
with
some
of
their
rights.
and,
one
of
the
congressmen
said,
“well,
this
is
the
wrong
form.
if
you've
got
any
claims,
you
should
go
to
the
courts
because
there'll
be
condemnation,
you'll
get
paid
whatever
you're
entitled
to,
and
that's
all
there
is
to
it.”
now,
the
tuscarora
didn't
bring
that
to
the
congress
at
all
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
congress?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
outside
--
it
didn't
emerge
in
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
outside
of
congress,
it
came
up
in
the
early
part
of
1957.
this
law
was
passed
in
august
of
1957.
in
1956
they
told
me,
it
came
up
for
the
first
time
when
--
and
then
it
was
brought
explicitly
to
their
attention
by
publication
in
the
newspapers
of
the
map
and
where
it
would
go
with
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
also,
they
requested
in
the
early
part
of
1957,
the
right
to
survey
and
so
forth
so
that
the
--
and
then
the
exhibit
191
in
the
new
york
power
authority
that
was
presented
in
1957
was
clearly
indicated,
although
it
didn't
say
tuscarora
on
it,
but
it
had
to
go
by,
if
you
look
at
the
roads
and
other
identification
items
on
that
presentation
of
the
diagram,
it
clearly
showed
that
it
had
to
go
into
the
tuscarora
lands
in
a
substantial
amount.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
is
the
problem
that
the
power
commission
examined
in
great
deal
are
the
remand
and
i
want
to
try
to
show
what's
involved
here.
there's
17,021
acres
here
and
there
are
439
homes.
in
the
indian
area,
there
are
37
homes
and
1383
acres.
now,
the
--
the
number
of
homes
involves
a
very
great
problem
of
trying
to
move
those
as
they're
recently
built.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
an
--
it's
an
addition
to
the
town
of
lewiston
as
part
of
that
general
area.
and
there
are
two
cemeteries,
here
and
here
with
3,000
graves.
they
figured
it'd
cost
$400
a
grave
to
move
those
cemeteries.
and
this
land
all
together
in
order
to
take
them
and
bring
this
satisfactory
even
then,
because
you
have
to
take
a
main
road
that
goes
up
to
this
community
here,
i
think
it's
lockport
and
a
bunch
from
here,
and
you
have
to
move
that
entirely.
it
would
take
around
$27
million
to
try
to
take
this
area
and
use
it
for
the
reservoir
in
place
of
the
others.
and
you
would
have
a
less
satisfactory
engineering
wise
project
by
doing
it.
now,
this
land
is,
considerable
of
it
is
--
it
hasn't
--
wasn't
farmed
during
1958.
some
of
it
is
--
was
appeared
--
appeared
to
be
abandoned
as
far
as
the
fields
are
concerned
not
actively
farmed
at
all,
and
the
housing
developments
there
of
the
37
homes
that
there
are
is
--
is
not
very
elaborate.
the
total
cost
that
the
power
authority
offered
to
--
they
offered
$1,100
an
acre
for
the
land.
and
they
agreed
to
move
the
houses
and
give
them
very
advantageous
rate
on
power
and
employ
them.
and
the
total
value
of
all
of
that
for
the
13,083
acres
was
figured
at
$2,400,000.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
think
that
the
congress
must
have
known
that
it
was
involved
generally,
although
this
came
up
in
1957,
and
--
and
after
1956
disaster
of
the
schoellkopf
matter
where
they
increased
the
size
of
it.
but
every
map
of
this
area
shows
this
indian
--
indian
reservation
right
here.
all
the
government
maps
and
the
--
in
fact
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it
shows
it
--
as
indian
land
right
at
this
point
in
the
americana
encyclopedia
and
rand
mcnally
maps.
so
that
anyone
that
was
looking
in
this
area
at
all
would
seem
like
they'd
have
to
know.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
if
that
--
that
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
it
gets
down
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
--
that
it's
contemplated
to
be
a
restraint
on
alienation
that
the
united
states
cannot
overcome
unless
they
expressly
name
the
tuscarora
as
being
the
interested
party.
and
we
would
think
that
for
several
reasons
that
does
not
apply.
in
the
first
place,
we
think
congress
is
the
sovereign
--
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
has
the
power
to
take
for
a
general
public
purpose.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it's
agreed
by
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that,
it's
whether
it
was
intended
by
the
congress.
and
as
we
read
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
we
read
the
decisions
of
whenever
congress
is
--
authorizes
a
project
where
the
taking
of
indian
lands
as
necessary,
and
there
is
a
specific
authorization,
that,
in
itself,
is
enough.
that
is,
if
the
congress
is
deciding
that
there's
a
public
use
for
which
there
must
be
a
taking
of
indian
property
and
it
authorized
that
public
use
and
it
just
couldn't
do
it
reasonably
otherwise,
then,
that
is
enough.
or,
if
the
congress
had
knowledge,
noticed
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
--
no
feasible
alternative.
i
think
in
the
tva
case
you
said,
you
don't
have
to
waste
public
money
in
order
to
take
one
alternative
against
another,
and
improperly
the
way
you
want
against
the
other.
and
then
decide
what
is
feasible.
and
then,
in
the
other
case,
if
the
congress
knows
that
indian
lands
are
in
the
area
that
might
be
taken,
that
is
enough
under
the
whole.
now,
there
are
several
cases
that
we
referred
to
in
which
the
congress
was
not
explicit
in
saying
that
certain
indian
lands
should
be
taken.
it
said
that
lands
along
this
line
or
such
a
line
as
we
maybe
redeveloped.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
none,
however
that
a
--
other
lines
might
be
established
later
in
as
--
in
order
to
carry
out
this
project
and
of
course,
this
is
an
exercise
by
the
new
york
power
authority
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it's
very
close
because
of
this.
this
is
the
line
that
they
said
was
going
to
border,
the
military
road
and
witmer
and
extends
to
the
tuscarora.
now,
if
you
assume
that
this
is
infeasible
and
this
is
not
because
of
a
community
disruption
on
the
--and
a
very
great
compared
to
the
cost.
then,
the
only
way
that
anybody
could
reasonably
assume
you
were
going,
would
be
to
take
some
of
the
tuscarora
lands.
that
had
to
follow.
if
you
are
going
to
enlarge
the
reservoir
and
if
you're
going
to
hope,
use
the
whole
share.
nobody
ever
at
any
time
contemplated
not
using
the
whole
share
of
the
united
states
water.
part
of
it
was
to
go
to
niagara
mohawk,
part
of
it
to
power
authority
but
they're
going
to
use
it
at
all.
now
that
they're
going
to
put
it
all
on
the
power
authority,
you'd
got
to
go
with
some
place
with
the
reservoir
under
what
they've
been
talking
all
this
time
about
with
the
pump-generating
program
and
trying
to
make
as
much
power
than
we
already
--
and
people
could
use
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
439.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
439.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
there
--
the
439
homes
involves
cost.
and
it
would
involve
the
--
the
removal
of
those
or
replacement
in
value.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
the
putting
of
a
reservoir
would,
because
when
you
put
the
reservoir
over
in
there,
then,
you
get
into
all
of
their
sewer,
water,
fire
and
everything
else.
now,
that's
comparable
to
what
came
up
about
the
congress.
the
power
authority
wanted
to
have
open
conduits
run
down
here
through
the
city.
and
the
federal
power
commission
decided
that
they're
--
they
have
to
be
cut
and
covered
as
they
cut
the
conduit
and
then
they
covered
over
it
so
that
they
--
people
could
pass
back
and
forth
and
even
with
the
conduit
at
least,
they
offered
to
put
bridges
and
other
approaches
to
get
back
and
forth,
but
the
power
commission
said,
well,
that
would
just
tear
the
community
up
and
there
would
only
be
a
few
areas,
and
the
community
objected
very
violently
to
it.
so
they
insisted
that
they
could
cut
the
community
up
that
way.
now,
if
you
have
a
big
reservoir
like
this,
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
try
to
bridge
it
and
it
just
couldn't
be
done.
so,
everybody
--
everything
would
have
to
go
around.
and
that's
what
i
mean
by
community
disruption.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
one
plan
that
you
could
see
from
this
town
operates
for
about
sections,
640
acres.
the
properties
as
far
as
the
buildings
and
homes
that
are
involved
and
the
barns
are
concerned,
there
are
only
i
think
one
substantial
barn
and
four
or
five
others
are
not
elaborate
at
all.
and
they
could
be
replaced
to
consider
--
some
of
them
--
many
of
them
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
even
rebuild.
you'd
build
the
new
homes
in
this
offer
in
order
to
have
them
--
have
better
homes
than
they
have.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
wherever
land
could
be
obtained
in
that
general
area
and
there
is
ample
in
the
area
that
could
be
obtained
for
the
reservation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
are
around
600
and
then
there
are
others
living
with
them
i
think
that
rounds
it
up
to
around
1000
in
the
area.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
there
is
--
they
make
that
claim
and
i
think
there
might
be
something
to
that.
but
i
think
that
it
doesn't
have
the
legal
merit
as
to
--
when
the
united
states
tries
to
do
something
in
behalf
of
all
the
people.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that's
the
difference.
but
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
that
is
a
factor
that
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
that
is
involved
in
the
congress'
action
in
deciding
on
a
public
use.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
known
of
any
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
just
a
belief
of
everybody
on
power
authority
on
the
commission's
side
that
it
was
already
part
of
their
contemplation
when
they
decided
on
giving
this
amount
of
water
to
the
power
authority
and
that
it
had
to
be
done
this
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
of
power
i
guess.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
furthermore,
i'd
like
to
briefly
touch
on
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
--
mr.
chief
justice
if
you'll
permit
me,
i'd
like
to
try
to
answer
that
on
rebuttal
because
i
want
to
be
more
accurate
and
i
didn't
examine
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
so
that
i
can
be
careful,
and
i
think
i
can
answer
that
until
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
court
said
before
in
regard
to
the
legal
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
if
we
turn
to
the
federal
power
act
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
because
it
slopes
down
for
the
escarpment
here
and
it
gives
dead
storage
rather
a
fall
of
gravity
that
will
help
produce
power.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
so,
the
engineers
said
it
was
infeasible
and
that's
all
i
know,
i'm
not
an
expert
in
that.
now,
with
regard
to
the
federal
power
act,
it
said
the
problem
is
section
3
and
4,
4
(e)
and
that's
on
page
--
pages
80
and
81
of
the
government's
brief.
and
it's
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
section
4
(e)
that
required
a
finding
by
the
federal
power
commission
that
the
reservation
--
taking
this
portion
of
the
reservation
would
not
interfere
or
be
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
for
which
the
reservation
was
established.
it
does
not
apply
to
these
lands,
because
these
are
not
lands
of
the
united
states.
these
lands
are
held
in
fee
simple
by
the
tribe.
they
were
purchased
by
the
tribe
and
they
were
not
created
by
treaty,
by
congressional
act,
or
by
executive
order.
so,
they
are
not
reservations
in
any
of
those
senses.
now
the
position
of
the
federal
power
commission
that
section
3
in
referring
to
reservations
necessarily
refers
that
in
3
(2)
where
it
eliminates
reservations
as
being
part
of
public
lands
in
the
definition,
referred
back
to
the
lands
owned
by
the
united
states,
in
the
second
line
of
3
(1)
--
second
line
of
3
(1).
and
then
when
it
goes
down,
reservation
means
national
forest,
of
course
those
who
owned
by
the
united
states,
tribal
lands
embraced
within
indian
reservations,
and
many
times
they're
owned
by
the
united
states
so
far
as
public
domain.
military
reservations,
and
then
it
goes
on,
and
other
lands
and
interest
of
lands
owned
by
the
united
states.
so,
it's
our
position
that
this
definition
meant
only
lands
in
which
the
united
states
had
a
property
interest.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
read
that
that
and
--
in
the
first
place
in
(1),
it
says
land
owned
by
the
united
states.
then,
it
goes
on
in
(2)
and
says,
these
various
lands
that
are
owned
by
the
united
states,
and
then
it
says,
and
other
lands
and
interest
in
lands
owned
by
united
states.
so,
we
say
that
all
these
others
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
(2)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
no,
because
reservations
are
expressly
excluded.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
it's
talking
about
lands
that
are
owned
by
the
united
states,
then,
it
goes
on
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
we
say
that
--
and
other
lands
and
interest
in
lands
owned
by
the
united
states
modifies
that
and
the
other
reservations
that
are
described.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
our
position
that
there
are.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
the
power
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
commission
concedes
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
yes.
now,
the
difference
is
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
our
construction
of
what
the
statute
meant.
but
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
interest
that
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to
of
guardianship
was
a
sufficient
interest
under
section
4
(e).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
and
the
position
of
the
government
that
this
statute
never
contemplated
anything
like
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
do
it
by
that
and
also
by
the
--
owned
by
the
united
states
above.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
say
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
we
accept
that
burden
and
point
out
that
in
the
history,
the
whole
concept
of
this
act
if
you'll
notice,
this
is
the
authority
to
license.
it
is
not
merely
the
authority
to
take
lands,
but
it's
an
authority
to
license.
and
that's
based
upon
parts
of
the
constitution.
the
one
is
the
commerce
power
and
the
other
is
the
property
power.
and
nothing
in
the
whole
history
said
anything
about
indian
commerce
as
being
any
basis
for
this
federal
power
act.
it
was
never
contemplated.
now,
there
are
two
committees
worked
on,
one
of
them
was
in
regard
to
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states
and
properties
and
the
other
was
in
regard
to
interstate
--
and
foreign
commerce.
and
nothing
was
brought
up
at
anytime
about
the
question
of
the
indian.
so,
i
say
that
the
power
act
was
directed
to
the
proposition
of
the
basis
for
constitutional
authority
to
--
and
looking
back
to
1920,
you
know
that
was
a
very
real
question
at
that
time,
the
authority
of
the
united
states
to
authorize
this
type
of
license.
and
one
basis
was
the
--
the
general
commerce
power
and
that
was
--
what
was
considered
by
the
committees
and
all,
and
the
other
was
the
general
property
clause
and
nothing
about
this.
and
then,
if
you'd
--
you
see
in
section
21,
there
is
a
general
condemnation
power
and
unless
there
was
some
special
reason
for
not
including
indian
that
had
tribal
in
the
fee,
that
could
be
reached
there
without
any
question.
but,
if
you
have
these
--
this
type
of
property
whether
the
united
states
had
a
property
interest,
there
is
no
provision
either
in
section
21
or
other
statutes
to
reach
that
land
and
permit
the
use
of
it.
on
the
other
hand,
almost
--
or
a
great
proportion
of
the
projects
that
were
authorized
by
the
federal
power
commission
were
contemplated
as
being
authorized
will,
had
to
have
some
lands
that
the
federal
government
had
a
property
interest
in
--
in
order
to
be
able
to
be
feasible
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
there
was
no
question
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
i
agree
completely
with
that
but,
the
congress
didn't
consider
it.
there
isn't
a
--
a
syllable
of
history
that
they
examined
anything
but
this
property
power
and
then
the
commerce
power
generally.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
read
in
the
idea
that
they
also
have
power
to
license
under
this
clause
of
the
constitution
that
follows
up
in
regard
to
commerce
with
indian
tribes.
but
there
is
nothing
like
that
in
the
history
at
all
and
when
they
asked
the
subcommittee
of
the
judicial
committee
whether
they
had
such
power,
they
have
to
do
--
we
have
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
and
under
the
property
clause
power.
so,
that
they
--
that
was
what
they
were
considering
and
when
you
take
the
further
addition
that
they
provide
for
an
annual
charge
to
take
care
of
this
land
that's
involved
here
to
be
paid
to
the
united
states,
it
seems
like
it's
clear
that
they
had
no
contemplation
of
anything
like
this
type
of
land.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
the
license
is
--
is
validated,
then,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
go
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
has
to
be
a
finding
under
4
(e)
or
not.
if
you
find
these
lands
are
not
under
4
(e),
then,
there
is
a
power
to
condemn
under
section
21.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
the
section
21
says
the
licensee
can
condemn
and
so
forth.
so
that
it
follows
that
if
you
were
a
licensed
--
a
licensee
that
doesn't
have
any
problem
about
4
(e),
that
you
could
condemn
under
section
21,
that
would
be
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
don't
think
so
because
we
think
that
the
reference
in
particular
to
section
4
(e)
where
they
do
deal
with
tribal
lands,
especially
would
leave
everything
else
like
all
the
other
kinds
of
properties
that
are
committed
to
be
condemned
that
are
held
in
by
other
people
of
all
kinds
to
be
condemned
under
section
21,
because
there's
a
deal
--
that
they
do
deal
especially
or
particularly
in
section
4
(e)
with
a
certain
type
of
land.
and
there
isn't
any
question
about
the
congress
power
to
reach
indian
lands
generally
anytime
it
wants
to
under
any
general
statute.
and
that
every
time
it's
dealt
with
them
in
general
statutes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
you
can't
reach
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
part
of
it.
and
also
because,
that's
going
to
need
protection,
because
that
isn't
entitle
to
the
united
states,
it
can
be
reached
otherwise
by
section
21,
because
there
is
a
general
power
to
condemn
in
section
21.
but
here,
there
is
no
power
to
condemn
with
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
i'm
trying
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
power
to
condemn
lands
of
the
united
states
by
anybody.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
unless
someone
says
you
can.
and
generally,
the
congress
doesn't
say,
if
you've
got
a
reservation
for
one
purpose
of
public
use
that
they've
already
decided
is
important
to
the
public
that
you
can
go
and
take
that
for
another
public
use.
but
they
tried
to
reserve
both
of
them.
that's
why
they
stay
inconsistent
not
only
as
to
these
lands
but
also
as
to
military
reservations
and
other
--
or
the
other
categories
in
section
4.
that's
not
limited
just
to
indians.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
limited
through
reservations
that
congress
has
created
and
others.
now,
they
say,
if
it's
inconsistent
though
or
interfere
with,
that's
the
condition
they
set
down.
but,
that,
they
don't
--
you
don't
need
that
provision
at
all
if
the
lands
don't
belong
to
the
united
states,
because
they
could
be
condemned
and
then
you
don't
have
the
provision
of
an
annual
charge
to
compensate.
as
to
those
others
you've
got
to
pay
just
compensation
which
will
fully
take
care
of
the
opportunity
to
replace.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
no,
mr.
justice,
i
mean,
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
it
--
it's
dealing
especially
with
reserved
lands
in
this
area.
and
it
says,
we
have
already
dedicated
to
a
public
use
reserved
lands
in
every
case.
congress
or
the
executive
has
said,
this
shall
be
a
military
reservation.
this
shall
be
another
public
reservation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
--
i
have
difficulties
just
saying
yes
without
more
knowledge
as
to
what
might
be
in
that,
but
i
think
that
with
this
group
that
are
involved
here,
it
would
--
but
i
was
trying
to
show
that
you
have
to
have
this
kind
of
a
provision
to
make
these
projects
possible
or
you
couldn't
even
use
those
lands
at
all
because
nobody
would
have
the
right
to
condemn
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
two
minutes,
i
suppose
you
said
five.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
i've
tried
to
keep
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
first
to
try
to
reach
the
(inaudible)
this
land
as
compared
to
(inaudible).
this
is
the
land
within
this
(inaudible)
with
the
whole
tuscarora
reservation.
(inaudible)
but
could
be
used
for
(inaudible)
and
there's
considerable
work
here
--
i
mean
here,
here
and
around
this
swamp.
this
is
exhibit
227
that
is
not
in
this
transcript
of
record
but
it's
in
the
whole
record
that
the
court
has.
and
i
rather
than
relying
on
me
entirely,
i
suggest
that
you
might
want
to
compare
it
and
see
for
yourselves
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
in
regard
to
that,
the
area
that
was
lobbied
in
this
1100
acres
to
directly
from
the
east
and
contiguous
in
regard
to
settlement.
it
is
immensely
federal
land.
it's
been
tilt
by
a
white
farmers
and
(inaudible)
with
much
better
improvements.
so
that
it
is
not
something
far
away
in
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
by
a
member
of
the
court.
it
is
contiguous
land
and
how
much
it
--
it
is
better
land
as
farmland
and
so
forth
whether
it
says
by
their
purposes
or
not
is
another
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
understand
that
this
is
really
a
congressional
reservation
at
all,
but
the
state
of
new
york
did
offer
to
make
a
tax-exempt
like
this
land
is,
so
as
to
give
them
that
benefit.
and
i
think
that
would
be
substantially
what
their
benefits
were
and
i
think
it
would
still
be
protected
by
the
trust
interest
of
the
united
states
as
guardian.
now,
the
question
was
asked
in
regard
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
great
problem
about
the
legislation,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
the
character
of
the
proposed
bill
that
was
suggested.
and
i
haven't
examined
this
myself,
and
i
haven't
--
just
telling
what
i
was
advised
about
it,
but
the
--
the
difficulty
at
least
that
the
power
authority
in
the
state
of
new
york
had
with
it,
whether
they
were
right
or
not,
if
the
court
wishes
i
will
try
to
secure
a
copy
and
furnish
it,
was
that
the
effect
of
the
bill
would
be
not
only
to
reach
this
particular
problem
of
condemnation
but
will
raise
of
the
question
of
the
whole
150
years
of
new
york's
condemnation
of
indian
lands
in
connection
with
roads
and
every
other
public
project
that
counsel
for
the
authority
has
described.
new
york
has
followed
the
practice
of
condemning
these
indian
lands
for
they
were
not
owned
by
the
united
states
just
like
they
were
anybody
else's.
and
so,
this
legislation
would
show
a
recognition
of
the
state
of
new
york
of
that
kind
of
theory.
and
they
were
just
unwilling
to
expose
themselves
to
a
litigation
that
would
be
almost
limitless.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
doubt
that
the
impression
had
no
part
in
this
kind
of
negotiation
so
i
don't
know
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
of
my
own
knowledge
that
the
parties
couldn't
agree
to
that
limited
kind
of
legislation
and
that
it
would
--
would
only
be
legislation
was
so
broad
that
would
threaten
everything
that
new
york
states
done
for
many
years
in
this
kind
of
action.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there's
the
further
problem
in
this
case,
and
i
want
to
turn
to
that
next
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
for
the
question
of
the
license
whether
it's
valid.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
i
can't
answer
that
except
the
parties
couldn't
agree
on
the
type
of
legislation.
now,
why
they
didn't
each
try
to
go
their
own
way
and
get
some
solution,
i
don't
know.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
federal
government
is
greatly
interested
in
the
license
and
having
it
effective,
we
thought
it
was
taken
care
of
by
the
legislation.
now,
when
you
come
to
mr.
justice
black's
suggestion,
unless
there
could
be
some
doubt,
well,
of
course
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
it's
here
because
of
that
and
their
other
decisions.
so
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[laughs]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
[laughs]
hope
it
isn't
that
kind
of
a
question
before
you,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
like
to
turn
just
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
construction
of
this
act,
and
i
think
the
whole
case
turns
upon
this
one
question.
and
that
is
section
4
on
page
80
of
the
government's
brief
that's
been
referred
to
before.
if
you
read
as
--
as
it
starts
out,
you'll
notice
the
commission
is
hereby
authorized
and
empowered
to
issue
licenses.
now,
that's
all
that
section
4
is
about.
giving
the
commission
the
power
to
issue
a
license
but
this
act
of
85-159
bearing
on
7
--
page
79,
section
2
at
the
bottom,
and
also
the
direction
as
to
who
should
receive
this
license
doesn't
give
any
power
or
question
or
right
in
the
commission
to
decide
who
shall
get
this
license.
it
doesn't
give
them
a
chance
to
consider
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
reservation
involved
or
any
other
elements
in
section
4.
this
act
is
conclusive,
and
i
emphasize
that.
this
act
says
this
license
shall
be
issued
under
the
terms
of
this
act.
and
4
(e)
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
you
shall
or
shall
not
issue
a
license.
it
is
just
that
simple.
now,
if
we
would,
for
a
moment
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
see,
in
section
4,
the
congress
is
telling
the
commission
that
they
are
empowered,
they
are
authorized
and
empowered
upon
certain
conditions
to
issue
a
license.
and
if
they
find
that
--
for
instance,
assume
that
this
was
a
government
reservation.
let's
assume
that
this
was
an
important
military
reservation
here,
belongs
to
united
states
government.
section
4
(e)
requires
that
there'd
be
a
finding
before
you
can
issue
a
license,
that
there'd
be
no
interference
or
inconsistency
with
it.
that's
not
just
confined
to
--
to
indian
lands,
it
applies
to
government
reservations
too.
but
congress
has
taken
that
away
from
the
commission.
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
--
the
other
act
on
page
79,
in
section
2
and
also
in
the
beginning
on
page
76.
now,
if
you
turn
to
76
first,
the
federal
power
commission
is
hereby
expressly
authorized
and
directed.
they're
given
no
choice.
if
they
would
find
some
federal
reservation,
some
military
reservation
of
prime
importance
in
exactly
that
same
space
that
section
4
(e)
would
apply
to,
and
it
interfered
and
was
inconsistent,
they
still
are
directed
by
the
congress
to
proceed
to
issue
this
license,
and
they're
given
no
choice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
the
--
they
shall
include
among
the
licensing
conditions
in
addition
to
those
deemed
necessary
and
required
under
the
terms
of
federal
power
act
certain
specific
things.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
you
want
to
know
what
they
include
in
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
having
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
having
difficulty
with
what
conditions
you
are
referring
to,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now
--
now,
section
10
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
would
be
invalid.
but
section
10
is
the
one
that
has
the
licensing
conditions
for
the
federal
power
act,
not
the
other
ones.
now,
if
you
would
turn
with
me
to
page
81
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
not
4
(e)
at
all
because
that
is
the
power
to
grant
the
license.
section
10
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
10
doesn't
have
any
--
any
question
of
interfering
whether
inconsistent,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
say
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
would
be
invalid,
mr.
justice,
but
it
does
not
apply.
that's
my
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
what
we
try
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
the
--
if
that
condition
is
properly
required,
we
say
that
in
--
the
proper
interpretation
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
doesn't
in
this
--
to
this
particular
land
anywhere.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
so
that's
still
left
but
you
may
still
disagree
with
that,
then
if
you
disagree
with
that,
then
i
think
that
condition
is
no
complied
with
and
the
decision
below
would
be
affirmed.
but
i
am
saying
to
you,
and
i
think
that
any
examination
will
satisfy
you
that
section
4
is
the
power
to
issue
a
license.
and
it
says
in
that
event,
you
will
see
--
you'll
make
the
finding
that
it
doesn't
interfere
or
isn't
inconsistent
with.
and
i
am
saying
the
congress
said
you
shall
disregard
all
of
that
business
and
issue
this
license
in
so
many
words.
and
that
the
authority
and
power
and
direction
to
issue
the
license
is
covered,
so
that
4
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
matter.
then
you
turn
from
the
beginning
there
to
the
--
the
conditions,
licensing
conditions,
and
that's
section
10
in
the
federal
power
act.
it
isn't
4
at
all.
section
10
provides
certain
conditions
that
they
shall
consider
and
see
whether
they
apply
and
they
shall
apply
according
to
the
direction
of
the
congress
where
isn't
inconsistent
with
the
basic
act
of
1957
such
additional
conditions
in
section
10
as
are
applicable.
so
i'm
trying
to
present
the
argument
and
i
think
it's
conclusive
in
regard
to
the
validity
of
this
license
that
4
has
no
application
whatsoever,
that
the
congress
on
its
own
decided
that
that
--
that
section
should
not
apply,
that
this
particular
license
not
only
it
was
authorized
but
they
were
directed
to
grant
it.
and
then
i
say
that
once
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it's
--
it's
specially
noted
in
the
act
as
conditions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
section
10.
conditions
of
the
licenses
is
the
heading
that's
used
on
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
section
4
is
the
authority
to
make
the
license
in
the
first
place
and
that
was
granted
and
precluded
by
the
other.
and
then
i
just,
if
i
may,
have
one
more
minute,
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
once
you
come
to
that
conclusion,
this
court
has
held
that
these
--
these
restraints
on
alienation,
and
that
kind
of
general
legislation
has
no
effect
on
the
sovereign,
that
the
sovereign,
once
it
decides
to
use
a
particular
property.
now,
you
may
have
troubled
the
question
of
what
the
congress
really
knew
and
decided
this.
but
if
it
did
decide,
then
those
considerations
have
no
bearing
upon
the
sovereign's
being
able
to
decide
the
united
states.
this
public
use
is
more
important.
now,
if
they
do
decide
that
and
it's
already
been
dedicated,
of
course,
they
have
to
compensate
for
the
prior
use
that
they
have
dedicated
to
before.
but
it
doesn't
keep
the
sovereign
from
taking
it,
otherwise,
we
couldn't
have
these
public
properties
developed.
