justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible),
do
you
say
that
congress
directed
the
issue
to
be
licensed
under
1957
act
to
be
granted
then
by
the
federal
power
commission?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
in
fact
the
government's
position
does,
by
relying
upon
the
meaning
of
reservation
as
defined
in
section
2
(b).
isn't
that
provision
--
does
--
does
the
government
dispute
the
position
you
now
did?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
would,
if
i
may
ask
you
so,
mere
consent
of
the
congress
obviate
need
the
compliance
of
177?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
excuse
me.
go
ahead
--
you
go.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
may
i
ask
you
a
question
mr.
lazarus
please?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
section
177
applies
at
all,
then
it
requires
either
a
treaty
or
a
convention,
does
it
not?
how
then
would
mere
consent,
either
expressed
or
implied,
satisfy
that
section,
if
it
applies?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
lazarus,
may
i
ask,
what
carved
you
to
say
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
concluding
phrase
of
section
3
(2)
owned
by
the
united
states
modifies
in
this
definition
of
the
word
“reservation”
the
preceding
characterizations
of
national
forests,
tribal
lands
embraced
with
indian
reservations,
military
reservations,
and
other
lands?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
that
you
never
loose
the
title.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
would
continue
to
get
an
annuity
ad
infinitum.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now
can
you
point
to
any
language
in
section
10
that
deals
with
payment
other
than
to
the
united
states?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then,
may
i
ask
you
first?
i
got
a
series
of
two
or
three
questions.
do
you
agree
that
it
is
within
the
power
of
congress
to
artificially
define
the
word
“reservation”
for
the
purposes
of
the
power
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
number
two,
if
the
findings
that
are
required
by
4
(e)
mainly
that
the
license
will
not
interfere
with
or
be
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
--
for
which
the
reservation
was
created
had
been
made
by
the
commission,
then
you
would
claim,
would
you,
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
payment
on
an
annual
rental
basis
under
10?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
now,
i
understand
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
is
the
situation
in
your
argument,
as
i
follow
you,
because
the
findings
required
by
4
(e)
were
not
made
by
the
commission.
