mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
crucial
issue
in
this
case
as
has
been
recognized
by
the
court
is
whether
congress
in
some
way
has
authorized
or
otherwise
consented
that
for
taking
of
a
portion
of
the
tuscarora
reservation
for
use
in
the
niagara
project.
respondent's
position
in
essence
is
that
there
is
no
such
consent
stating
of
indian
tribal
lands
either
in
the
1957
statute
authorizing
the
project
or
in
the
federal
power
act
or
in
any
combination
of
these
two
laws.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
what
i
--
what
i
mean
your
honor
is
that,
in
view
of
the
special
protections
over
indian
lands
and
the
guardianship
relationship
of
the
united
states
to
indian
tribes
including
the
tuscarora
nation,
that
if
the
power
of
eminent
domain
is
to
be
exercised
on
tribal
lands,
we
must
have
some
expressed
authority
from
congress
to
do
it.
now,
it
must
be
either
expressly
in
that
statute
to
conform
with
the
rule
of
elk
against
wilkins,
the
general
acts
don't
apply
to
indians
unless
clearly
manifested
by
congress
or
we
must
find,
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
district
of
columbia
circuit
found
in
seneca
nation
against
brucker
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
is
so
clear
that
congress
intended
to
take
indian
lands
that
we
can
find
a
congressional
consent.
that
is,
again,
to
restate
it
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
indian
lands
combined
with
the
guardianship
interest
of
the
united
states,
is
of
such
a
nature
that
we
must
spell
out
a
repeal
at
the
protection.
we
can't
find
it,
i
might
add,
by
implication
and
i
will
get
to
it
a
little
later
into
my
--
in
my
argument
and
to
just
why
the
authority
cited
by
the
government
in
this
case
in
making
its
argument
on
consent
by
implication
just
don't
stand
up
on
this
group.
but,
there
has
to
be
something
affirmative
by
congress
before
the
--
we
can
find
the
authority
for
the
taking
of
indian
lands.
now,
before
getting
into
the
main
point
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
take
up
two
matters
where
i
feel
that
the
argument
by
petitioners
has
been
misleading.
now,
the
first
is
the
opening
remarks
of
the
solicitor
general
with
reference
to
the
language
of
the
1957
act.
the
solicitor
general
said
that
the
act
specifically
recited
that
it
was
the
act
under
which
the
project
was
to
be
licensed
and
that
inconsistent
rules
and
regulations
of
the
federal
power
commission
must
give
way.
now,
what
the
solicitor
general
forgot
to
point
to
is
section
1(b)
of
the
act
in
which
it
is
specifically
recited
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well
actually
it's
in
the
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
page
76
of
the
government's
brief.
if
we
look
at
section
1
(b)
of
the
act,
it
says,
“the
federal
power
commission
shall
include
among
the
licensing
condition
in
addition
to
those
deemed
necessary
and
required
under
the
terms
of
the
federal
power
act
to
follow.”
and
then,
are
specified
seven
conditions
which
were
the
seven
conditions
put
in
the
act
in
order
to
settle
this
seven
year
controversy.
these
were
the
concessions
to
niagara
mohawk
and
of
the
neighboring
states
into
the
conservation
interest.
but
these
did
not
have
to
do
with
the
basic
requirements
of
the
federal
power
act.
the
basic
requirements
of
the
federal
power
act
still
were
kept
alive
by
the
specific
terms
of
this
1957
statute.
and
if
we
had
it
to
go
into
the
legislative
history,
all
we
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
report.
so,
this
is
the
house
report,
the
senate
report
reads
exactly
the
same
way.
when
it
describes
the
bill,
it
says,
“the
bill
authorizes
and
directs
the
federal
power
commission
to
issue
a
license
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
federal
power
act
to
the
new
york
power
authority.”
so,
i
just
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
in
this
case.
the
explicit
statutory
language
says,
we
must
go
to
the
federal
power
act.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
what
--
what
the
statute
does
your
honor
and
what
the
court
below
found
is
that
the
statute
in
the
first
section
names
the
licensee.
now
this,
in
essence,
removes
the
power
of
the
commission
to
choose
among
competing
licensees.
and
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
that
is
section
1
(b),
there
are
--
there
is
the
direction
that
the
commission
shall
include
certain
licensing
conditions
in
the
license
and
seven
licensing
conditions
are
specified.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
it,
it
also
says
that
these
are
in
addition
to
those
deemed
necessary
and
required
under
the
federal
power
act.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
--
well,
that
is
true,
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
we
know
that
this
act
only
did
two
things.
all
it
did
was
name
the
licensee
and
specify
certain
conditions
to
go
in
the
license.
that's
all
this
act
did.
and
we
know
from
the
terms
of
this
that
everything
else
with
respect
to
the
license
is
controlled
by
the
federal
power
act.
but
that's
what
this
--
this
is
what
this
act
said.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
oh
yes.
the
government's
position
is
that
this
statute
licensed
a
project.
it
fixed
the
nature
of
the
project,
it
set
the
engineering
details
of
the
project,
and
that
all
that
federal
power
commission
had
was
a
ministerial
duty.
we
put
a
stamp
of
approval
on
this
project
licensed
by
congress.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
that
is
not
what
the
act
did.
what
the
act
did
is
name
the
licensee
and
specify
seven
conditions.
these
seven
condition
vary
in
some
respects
from
conditions
in
the
federal
power
act.
and
then,
with
respect
to
all
other
issues,
the
matter
was
to
be
decided
by
the
federal
power
commission
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
find
it
your
honor
in
the
--
in
this,
the
part
of
section
1
(b)
that
says,
in
--
at
--
1
(a)
says,
“federal
power
commission
grants
license.”
1
(b)
says
that
“the
power
commission
shall
include
among
the
licensing
conditions
in
addition
to
those
deem
necessary
and
required
under
the
terms
of
the
federal
power
to
follow.”
now,
as
i
read
that,
what
the
--
what
congress
was
saying
is
that
here
are
seven
specified
conditions.
with
respect
to
everything
else,
you
must
deal
with
the
federal
power
act.
and
this
is
--
this
is
what
the
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
they
are
--
they
are
not
included
in
the
statute
but
they
must
be
included
in
the
license.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
said
it
in
--
in
the
reverse
way
by
saying
that
you
are
putting
--
we
are
putting
in
--
that
there
are
conditions
in
the
federal
act.
these
we
recognize
exist.
in
addition
to
those
provisions
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
sections
3
(2)
and
4
(e).
4
(e)
which
says
--
4
(e)
which
says
that
before
you
can
issue
a
license
on
a
reservation
which
in
3
(2)
is
defined
as
an
indian
reservation,
you
must
make
a
finding
that
the
purpose
for
which
the
land
to
be
--
is
to
be
put
under
the
license
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
for
which
the
reservation
was
created
or
established.
and
my
point
here
is,
that
the
commission
has
made
a
finding
that
it
cannot,
in
this
case,
make
such
a
finding.
in
other
words,
that
what
the
new
york
power
authority
is
attempting
to
do
on
the
tuscarora
reservation
is
inconsistent
with
its
purpose.
it
could
not
make
the
finding
under
the
first
proviso
of
section
4
(e).
and
my
point
is
that
that
is
one
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
under
the
federal
power
act.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
going
any
further
than
licensing
conditions.
if
--
if
that's
what
you
mean,
your
honor.
all
i'm
--
all
i'm
trying
to
do
--
what
--
what
the
government's
argument
is,
is
that
the
1957
statute
superseded
section
4
(e)
that
we
never
have
to
get
to
section
4
(e).
and
my
argument
here
is
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
therefore,
it
was
specifically
preserved
under
this
act.
the
1957
statute
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
--
that's
all
i'm
relying.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
oh,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
if
i
gave
the
impression
i
was
going
any
further
than
that.
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
this
statute
on
its
face
did
not
supersede
section
4
(e).
and
it
didn't
do
it
on
it's
face,
it
didn't
do
it
in
the
committee
report,
and
i
believe
i
have
here
the
federal
power
commission's
own
report
on
the
legislation
in
which
they
point
out
that
directing
the
issuance
of
a
license
to
a
--
to
a
particular
licensee
is
a
unique
way
for
congress
to
act,
because
generally,
this
is
left
up
to
the
commission.
and
i'm
reading
now
from
the
hearings
on
these
bills
in
1957
before
the
senate.
this
is
april
10th,
1957
and
i'm
reading
at
page
7,
the
power
commission's
own
report
on
this
legislation
where
it
says,
“congress
--
congress
may
exercise
its
unquestioned
prerogative
of
selecting
the
licensee
by
direct
legislative
enactment.
moreover,
the
bill
properly
recognizes
the
fundamental
safeguards
to
the
public
interest
embodied
in
the
power
act,
and
that
the
commission
must
consider
the
power
authority's
plan
of
development
and
prescribe
whatever
license
terms
and
conditions
it
deems
necessary
to
effectuate
the
provisions
of
the
power.”
now,
what
i
say
is
that
this
is
a
clear
indication
that
section
4
(e)
is
preserved
by
this
1957
statute.
now,
in
their
arguments
to
that,
the
solicitor
general
and
counsel
for
the
power
authority
of
the
state
of
new
york,
both
have
emphasized
to
the
court
not
the
prime
issue
in
the
case
that
of
legislative
consent,
but
rather
the
physical
signs
and
importance
of
the
niagara
project.
now,
the
major
theme
seems
to
be
that
this
vast
project,
and
i
will
concede
right
here
and
now
that
it's
very
great
undertaking,
simply
cannot
be
constructed
to
plan
capacity
without
using
tuscarora
lands.
and
from
this
premise,
they
conclude
that
tuscarora
lands,
as
a
matter
of
necessity,
must
be
subject
to
condemnation
to
be
used
in
the
project.
now,
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
argument
is
being
made
in
the
wrong
court.
that
whether
the
alleged
necessity
to
take
tuscarora
lands
actually
justifies
a
taking
is
a
matter
for
congress
to
decide.
as
the
court
and
its
questions
recognized
that
a
portion
of
the
reservation
is
--
in
effect,
is
essential
to
full
development
of
the
niagara
river.
petitioners
could
and
they
still
can
go
to
congress,
and
congress,
in
turn,
has
the
undoubted
right
to
sanction
the
condemnation
of
a
portion
of
the
tuscarora
reservation.
we
don't
dispute
that
one
bit.
but
having
failed
to
go
to
congress
and
getting
legislative
treaty,
petitioners
may
not
now
seek
to
substitute
an
alleged
need
to
require
respondent's
land
for
the
necessary
legislative
consent,
the
taking
of
those
lands.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
with
the
--
as
it
is
pointed
out
in
footnote
5
of
my
brief,
that
when
we
were
discussing
settlement,
and
this
is
a
matter
which
actually
is
extraneous
to
the
legal
principles
in
the
case,
that
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
the
settlement
negotiations
broke
down
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
the
chairman
of
the
power
authority
wrote
to
me
saying,
“we
will
not
make
any
settlement
contingent
upon
federal
legislation.”
and
the
ground
expressed
in
the
letter
was,
we
have
to
know
the
exact
dimensions
of
the
reservoir
by
march
of
1959.
and
here,
it
is
december
of
1959
and
we're
still
litigating.
now,
getting
over
to
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
that
of
legislative
consent,
i
would
like
to
touch
very
briefly
upon
a
few
general
principles
of
law
which
have
guided
our
dealings
with
indian
tribes
for
175
years
in
which
i
feel
are
basic
to
resolution
and
understanding
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
that
is
as
the
court
has
recognized
by
its
question,
much
of
petitioners
would
like
to
ignore
the
fact.
respondent
is
an
indian
tribe
and
respondent's
lands
are
an
indian
reservation.
and
the
relationships
of
the
parties
in
this
case
are
not
the
same
as
they
would
be
if
non-indians
were
involved.
now,
i
think
i
can
state
the
general
proposition
very
simply
in
this
way
that
tuscarora
lands
are
subject
to
federal
prohibitions
against
alienation
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states.
and
in
view
of
this
prohibition
against
alienation,
the
expressed
consent
of
the
united
state
is
necessary
if
indian
lands
are
to
be
taken
or
otherwise
acquired.
and
again,
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
the
history
of
taking
of
indian
lands
is
actually
been
by
treaty
and
then
by
agreement.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
but
this
has
always
been
of
course
with
the
united
states
as
a
party.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
i
am
saying
that
with
--
with
only
one
or
two
exceptions.
the
exceptions
that
have
come
up
are
seneca
nation
against
brucker,
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
where
the
court
found
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
such
a
wealth
of
material
dealing
with
the
lands
as
the
seneca
nation
that
it
said,
“an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
take
can
be
found
in
the
act.”
but
otherwise
--
oh,
and
the
one
other
situation
is
one
out
in
montana
with
respect
to
the
yellowtail
dam.
but
in
every
other
situation,
these
--
congress
had
specifically
provided
either
in
the
general
authority
that's
25
united
states
code
357,
the
general
authority
to
condemn
a
lot
of
indian
lands.
or,
there
is
a
1926
statute
which
authorizes
condemnation
in
several
indian
lands.
in
--
in
my
brief,
i
cite
a
number
of
other
representative
statutes
where
congress
granted
specific
authority
to
take
indian
lands.
this
--
and
this,
of
course,
we
must
distinguish
between
the
corps
of
engineers
which
is
an
arm
of
the
united
states
and
the
power
authority
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
is
a
state
agency.
it
is
clear
that
where
a
state
agency
involved
--
is
involved
there
is
not
a
single
case
where
condemnation
has
been
authorized
without
specific
legislative
consent.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
but
the
point
i
am
seeking
to
establish
your
honor
is
very
simply
the
one
that
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
no,
i
am
not
making
that
argument,
your
honor.
i
would
say
in
the
--
on
the
of
facts
in
this
case,
the
commission
could
not
make
the
finding
under
4
(e)
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it's
--
my
position
is,
is
that
if
the
commission
could
make
the
finding
under
4
(e),
then,
tuscarora
lands
are
to
be
licensed
for
the
project
and
we
get
paid
an
annual
compensation
under
section
10
(e)
of
the
act
just
like
any
other
indian
land.
now
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
no.
my
position
--
and
--
and
this
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
this
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
my
position
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
as
we
see
here
on
the
map
--
what
--
what
the
power
authority
wants
to
--
to
flood
is
22%
of
the
reservation.
and
my
position
is,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
you
cannot
flood
22%
of
the
reservation
and
find
that
consistent
with
the
purpose
for
which
the
reservation
was
established.
but
i
don't
have
that
problem
on
the
facts
of
this
case
because
the
commission
refused
to
make
the
4
(e)
finding.
and
that
finding
has
never
--
that
refusal
has
never
been
appealed
and
is
not
before
this
court.
on
the
record
before
this
court,
we
must
accept
and
the
government
--
of
course,
the
commission
cannot
impeach
its
own
finding.
we
must
accept
that
the
--
that
4
(e)
finding
cannot
be
made
in
this
case
because
the
commission
said
it
could
not.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
in
other
words,
that
--
that
tuscarora
lands
were
not
covered
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
my
position
--
my
position
on
that
basically
is
that
there
is
still
not
enough
authority
to
find
--
to
authorize
the
condemnation
of
tuscarora
lands
because
section
21
is
a
general
authority
to
condemn
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
1957
act
giving
anyone
authority
to
condemn.
i
might
say
the
second
circuit
did
not
agree
with
me
on
this
point.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
not
--
not
at
all,
your
honor.
this
question
is
not
before
you
at
all.
if
--
if
the
4
(e)
finding
does
not
have
to
be
made,
as
i
say,
my
basic
position
is
that
we
then
don't
have
any
consent.
my
argument
with
respect
to
the
federal
power
is
that
assuming
we
have
to
find
consent
to
the
taking
of
indian
lands,
where
can
we
find
that
consent?
we
can
find
it
in
the
federal
power
act
only
in
sections
3
(2)
and
in
4
(e)
and
in
10
(e)
which
deal
with
indian
lands.
we
cannot
find
it
in
section
21
which
is
merely
a
general
authority
to
condemn.
now,
if
the
court
says
that
sections
4
(e),
and
therefore
section
3
(2)
and
section
10
(e),
don't
apply
to
the
tuscarora
reservation,
then,
we
have
no
consent
when
we
can't
bring
the
tuscarora
under
the
federal
power
act
because
as
the
language
in
three
sections
which
deals
with
indian
reservation.
and
then
turn
right
around
and
say
that
these
three
sections
don't
apply
to
it.
what
we
have
to
do
with
respect
to
the
federal
power
act,
if
we
find
consent
in
the
federal
power
act,
we
must
bring
tuscarora
lands
wholly
under
the
act
and
give
the
tuscarora
as
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
act.
but,
if
we
find
that
4
(e)
doesn't
apply,
then
we
are
thrown
back
upon
the
general
restriction
on
alienation
177
and
233
of
the
title
25.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
these
are
in
the
appendix
to
the
power
authority's
main
brief
at
page
6
(a)
and
7
(a).
section
177
says
that
“no
purchase,
grant,
lease
or
other
conveyance
of
land
or
of
any
title
or
claim
thereto
from
any
--
any
indian
nation
or
tribe
of
indians
shall
be
of
any
validity
in
law
or
equity
unless
the
same
be
made
by
treaty
or
convention
entered
into
pursuant
to
the
constitution.”
now,
since
1871,
the
united
states
has
not
been
entering
into
treaties
with
indian
tribes
but
it
has
been
making
agreements
with
them.
it's
the
only
difference
there
was
whether
both
houses
of
congress
would
approve
the
agreement
instead
of
just
the
senate
approving
the
treaty.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
this
is
why
i
feel
that
expressed
consent
of
congress
is
necessary.
in
other
words,
here
is
a
specific
statutory
protection
in
177.
i
might
add
it's
carried
over
specifically
to
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
next
quoted
statute
which
is
now
section
233
of
title
25.
and
these
are
specific
protections
against
--
or
let's
say
prohibition
which
is
in
the
amounts
for
protection,
it's
a
prohibition
against
the
alienation
of
indian
land
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
condemnation
is
a
form
of
alienation.
and
therefore,
i
would
say
it
is
--
it
operates
to
get
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
it
operates
to
extinguish
the
rights
of
the
indians
in
it
and
this
statute
says
that
no
such
extinguishment
shall
be
valid
in
law
or
equity
unless
done
with
the
consent
of
the
united
states.
this
is
--
this
is
all
i
am
--
all
i
am
arguing
as
i
am
not
trying
to
say
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
condemn
this
land.
all
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
the
restriction
on
alienation
plus
the
guardianship
entrusted
to
the
untied
states
in
these
lands
means
that
congress
must
express
itself
in
clear
terms.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
which
is
that
section
177
refers
to
treaties
or
conventions
and
his
question
was
why
i
said
that
consent
could
be
obtained
in
a
statute?
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
mere
--
mere
consent
expressed
in
a
statute
is
--
is
the
way
i
phrased
it,
your
honor.
and
i
think
we
can
find
the
answer
to
that
in
two
places.
one
of
the
places
is
in
an
1871
statute
which
is
codified
as
25
u.s.c.
section
71.
this
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs
except
in
one
footnote
in
my
brief,
which
says
that
henceforth,
no
treaty
shall
be
made
with
indian
tribes.
and
thereafter,
congress
has
dealt
with
indian
tribes
on
the
basis
of
statutes
frequently
incorporating
an
agreement
into
the
terms
of
the
statute.
in
terms
of
decisions
of
this
court,
there
is
the
decision
in
lone
wolf
against
hitchcock,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
i
believe,
at
page
75.
the
citation
is
187
u.s.
553,
the
1903
decision,
in
which
this
court
held
that
congress,
by
a
statute,
could
abrogate
a
treaty
with
an
indian
tribe.
insofar
as
indian
affairs
are
concerned,
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
practice
of
congress
seems
to
have
been
that
statutes
are
raised
to
the
same
level
as
treaties,
and
that
a
subsequent
statute
can
override
an
earlier
treaty.
so
now
the
treaties
are
no
longer
made,
the
will
of
congress,
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
consent
of
congress
is
expressed
in
the
statute.
now,
of
course,
the
expressed
congressional
consent
cannot
be
found
in
the
1957
act
authorizing
the
power
project.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
i
--
i
believe
they
used
necessity
in
two
context,
your
honor.
however,
the
government
does
not
claim,
not
in
the
briefs
and
not
in
argument
here
today,
that
there
was
any
reference
to
tuscarora
lands
in
either
of
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history.
the
only
reference
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
counsel
for
the
power
authority
said
that
a
map
had
appeared
in
a
newspaper
in
niagara
falls.
i
submit,
your
honor
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
congress
meant.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
the
--
what
he
said
with
respect
to
the
map
being
before
the
committee
of
congress
was
that
it
did
not
have
property
lines
on
it.
in
other
words,
my
--
my
reference
--
the
methods
--
if
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
he
is
saying.
now,
it
just
so
happens
that
that
particular
brochure,
the
exhibit
to
which
he
referred,
was
not
before
congress.
there
is
a
--
and
that
is
--
that
is
argued
in
the
brief.
but
even
assuming
that
it
were,
there
is
still
no
reference
here
that
nobody
looking
at
this
map,
at
least
no
average
congress
and
then
looking
at
this
map
could
possibly
deduce
from
this
that
indian
lands
were
caught.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
the
--
he
--
he
could
--
about
the
most
he
could
deduce
from
that
is
that
a
reservoir
was
necessary.
but
this
does
not
tell
either
the
congressmen
or
anyone
else
where
that
reservoir
is
going
to
be
located
because
a
60,000
acre-foot
reservoir
can
be
built
in
an
infinite
number
of
ways.
it
can
be,
as
this
plan
reservoir
is,
2,400
acres
in
surface
and
25
feet
deep
on
the
average
or
you
can
have
a
reservoir
covering
1,000
acres
and
60
feet
deep,
just
telling
a
member
of
congress
that
we're
going
to
build
a
60,000
acre-feet
reservoir
doesn't
tell
him
a
thing
about
its
size,
shape
or
anything
else.
now
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
found
on
the
rehearing,
and
i
might
say
that
it
is
respondent's
position
that
its
whole
discussion
here
is
dicta.
on
rehearing,
it
said
that
this
is
the
best
way
because
of
the
community
disruption
and
expense
and
delay.
now,
the
first
time
this
was
up
before
the
commission.
in
other
words,
the
january
30,
1958
licensor,
which
is
what
this
appeal
is
based
on,
when
that
came
out,
the
commission
said
“alternative
lands
are
available”.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
and
then
it
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
or
rather
remanded
for
a
very
limited
purpose.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
the
sole
purpose
of
finding
out
whether
the
4
(e)
finding
could
be
made.
and
it
said,
“come
back
to
us
within
15
days.”
now,
the
commission
noticed
this
for
hearing
and
it
set
the
hearing
down
on
the
issues
presented
in
section
7
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
and
the
issue
in
section
7
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
was
solely
the
4
(e)
finding.
and
it
was
not
until
we
got
before
the
hearing
examiner
that
we
began
to
get
into
these
myriad
other
issues
about
alternative
lands
and
their
community
disruption
and
so
forth,
and
what
kind
of
use
tuscarora
is
made
of
the
land.
all
of
these
things
completely
irrelevant
to
what
the
case
was
remanded
for.
so
it's
my
basic
position,
one,
that
the
finding
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
necessity
in
february
of
1959,
which
sheer
dicta
was
completely
outside
of
what
the
case
was
sent
back
to
the
court.
now,
even
assuming
that
the
commission
had
a
right
to
make
some
kind
of
statement,
they
did
not
say
and
they
have
never
said
unequivocally
that
this
land,
tuscarora
land,
is
absolutely
essentially
to
build
the
project.
what
they
said
was
this
land
--
that
the
community
disruption
expense
and
delay
make
it
unfeasible
to
take
the
alternative
land.
now,
i
would
like
to
show
you
just
a
little
bit
about
that
alternative
land,
because
the
commission's
1959
finding
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
facts
that
existed
in
1957.
the
commission's
1959
statement
had
to
do
with
facts
that
existed
in
1959.
now,
for
example,
we
have
these
expensive
homes
here,
i
believe,
that
was
the
solicitor
general's
phrase,
expensive
homes
that
would
have
to
be
either
moved
or
destroyed.
now,
a
good
number
of
those
expensive
homes
were
built
in
1958.
now,
what
this
has
to
do
with
necessity
in
1957,
i
don't
understand.
in
addition
to
that,
mind
you,
the
alternatives
were
presented
only
by
the
power
authority.
and
the
power
authority,
we
can
well
imagine,
just
put
this
in
context,
was
not
going
to
come
up
before
the
commission
on
the
remand
and
say,
“yes,
alternatives
are
available
because
we,
the
power
authority,
had
been
building
it
the
other
way
for
a
year
and
a
half.”
and
they
certainly
were
not
going
to
come
up
before
the
commission
to
try
and
prove
that
alternatives
could
be
used.
so
what
they
did
was,
they
took
this
area
in
here,
1695
acres,
and
they
used
it
as
the
constant.
that's
what
they've
been
working
on.
and
there
was
no
variation
in
that.
so
that
when
you
eliminated
this
area
on
the
tuscarora
reservation
which
they
claimed
they
needed,
then
we
got
to
their
artificial
configuration
just
to
where
else
they
might
go.
but
the
fact
is
that
in
considering
this
1695
acres,
they
kept
not
only
the
surface
area
but
the
height
at
constant
and
the
reason
they
kept
the
height
at
constant
was
because
they
had
ordered
several
million
dollars
worth
of
machinery
for
generators,
etcetera,
which
they
said
they
could
not
change.
it
would
not
take
a
higher
reservoir.
so
all
of
the
evidence
before
the
federal
power
commission
is
based
on
activities
after
january
of
1958
when
the
license
was
issued.
and
all
of
this
great
expense,
great
delay,
great
communities
disruption
is
caused
solely
by
the
fact
that
the
power
authority
abandoned
every
possible
alternative
in
1957
and
went
ahead
notwithstanding
this
litigation
to
build
a
project
as
if
it
were
going
to
get
tuscarora
land.
now,
after
the
federal
power
commission
held
against
the
new
york
power
authority,
the
new
york
power
authority
came
in
with
an
application
for
an
amended
license.
and
now,
for
the
first
time
we
learn
that
we
can
raise
these
dikes
by
15
feet
and
still
use
the
machinery
that
was
on
order
back
in
1958.
so
we
don't
need
to
take
1721
acres,
and
we
don't
need
to
take
439
homes.
we
can
raise
the
dikes
here
by
15
feet
still
using
their
machinery
to
take
maybe
400
acres
in
there
and
get
a
60,000
acre-foot
reservoir.
so
that
there
is,
on
the
facts,
absolutely
no
necessity
for
taking
tuscarora
lands
even
using
their
facts.
and
of
course,
their
facts
are
1959
facts,
not
1957
facts.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
i
think
my
first
answer
to
that
is
as
it
was
obvious
from
the
questions
from
the
bench
that
the
language
speaks
for
itself.
tribal
lands
embraced
within
indian
reservations
means
on
the
face
of
the
statute
just
that.
we
have
a
category,
tuscarora
fits
in
to
it,
by
definition,
they
fall
in.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
do
--
i
might
say
that
--
that
the
construction
put
on
this
by
the
government
is
contrary
to
every
case
handed
down
in
every
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
fee
lands.
in
other
words,
this
court
in
candelaria
case,
in
the
sandoval
case,
both
of
which
are
cited
in
my
brief,
and
(inaudible)
said
that
fee
lands,
lands
owned
in
fee
by
indian
tribes
they're
entitled
to
exactly
the
same
protections
as
the
lands
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
helps
--
it
helps
me
in
this
way,
your
honor,
that
it
throws
--
that
the
general
rule
is
that
tuscarora
lands
ought
to
be
treated
the
way
other
lands
are.
so
this
draws
a
tremendous
burden
upon
the
government
to
say
that
somehow
congress
intended
to
make
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
the
federal
power.
congress
never
said
it
was
making
an
exception.
and
mind
you,
when
they
described
indian
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
your
honor,
the
statute
itself
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
the
--
if
i
may
give
you
one
more
generality
and
then
get
to
a
particularity,
the
--
the
next
thing
is
that
in
the
statute
itself,
in
dealing
with
indian
lands,
congress
made
a
distinction,
and
where
it
dealt
with
indian
reservations,
it
said
the
definition
of
reservations
includes
only
tribal
lands.
with
respect
to
individually
allotted
lands
within
indian
reservations,
they
get
treated
some
other
way.
now,
here
was
a
clear-cut
example
of
where
congress
in
the
statute
drew
a
distinction
within
indian
reservations
between
individual
lands
and
tribal
lands.
now,
what
the
government
is
asking
us
to
do
is
to
say
congress
drew
another
distinction.
it
was
not
only
a
distinction
between
individual
and
tribal
but
also
tribal-owned
in
fee
or
a
tribal
--
by
the
indians
or
a
tribe
owned
in
fee
by
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
then
--
then,
your
honor,
i
think
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
particular
point
which
i
think
effectively
demolishes
the
government
position
here,
which
is
very
(inaudible).
i
think
we
have
to
agree
if
we
look
at
the
statute
that
congress
intended
to
deal
with
indian
lands
under
the
statute.
it
referred
to
them
in
section
3
(2),
it
referred
to
them
in
section
10
(e).
and
by
reference,
they're
included
in
section
4
(e).
now,
the
government's
position
boils
down
to
this
that
--
that
indian
lands
that
congress
was
intending
to
deal
with
in
the
federal
power
act
are
only
indian
lands
which
the
united
states
may
dispose
of
under
the
property
clause.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
if
we
accept
that
construction,
we
eliminate
virtually
all
indian
lands
in
the
united
states
from
the
act,
because
what
kind
of
indian
lands
do
we
have
nowadays?
we've
got,
let's
say,
in
rare
instances,
the
type
of
indian
reservation
that
was
under
consideration
and
before
this
court
in
the
mcgowan
case
back
in
about
1940.
this
was
land
that
the
united
states
had
purchased
with
gratuity
funds.
it
was
on
the
public
domain
or
there
with
private
land
in
the
state
of
nevada,
had
been
purchased
with
gratuity
funds
and
set
aside
for
it.
all
right.
i
would
have
to
concede
that
is
land
owned
by
the
united
states,
but
the
number
of
acres
in
that
category
is
infinite
(inaudible).
we
have
some
reservations
set
aside
by
executive
order
where
the
indians
occupying
it
have
only
aboriginal
rights
and
which,
as
against
the
united
states,
are
non
compensable.
but
the
bulk
of
all
indian
reservations
in
the
united
states
are
reservations
today
where
the
indians
have
recognized
titles
to
their
lands,
either
by
virtue
of
treaty
or
by
virtue
of
statute
or
by
virtue
of
some
form
of
recognition
by
the
united
states
government.
and
it
has
been
the
consistent
rule
in
this
court
that
where
a
tribe
has
recognized
title
to
its
reservation
lands,
it
has
a
compensable
property
interest.
it
has
a
property
right
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
in
this
situation
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
this
--
under
the
federal
power
act,
the
government's
position
is
that
if
their
legal
title
is
in
the
united
states,
the
united
states
may
dispose
of
that
interest
under
the
property
clause.
now,
i
will
not
get
into
this
subject
of
whether
the
interest
of
the
united
states
where
it
had
fair
legal
title
as
a
property
interest.
let
us
assume
that
it
is,
assume
that
the
united
states
can
dispose
of
its
fee
under
the
property
clause,
it
cannot
dispose
of
the
indians'
interest
under
the
property
clause.
it
has
to
invoke
some
other
source
of
authority
to
dispose
of
the
indians'
interest,
because
that
is
not
property
of
the
united
states.
and
this
court
has
so
held
on
repeated
occasions.
it
has
--
now,
in
the
government's
reply
brief,
they
tried
to
deal
with
this
question
by
saying,
“oh,
we
invoke
the
power
of
eminent
domain”,
but
under
the
federal
power
act,
they
don't
invoke
the
power
of
eminent
domain
with
respect
to
lands
where
indians
have
recognized
titles.
they
license
it
under
10
(e).
and
i
say
the
only
way
you
can
license
under
10
(e)
is
under
the
indian
commerce
clause.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
no,
my
--
my
point
here
--
my
point
here
is
this,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
no.
not
at
all.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
not
--
not
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
--
i
have
said
in
my
brief
that
my
own
view,
and
i
must
say
that
i
don't
think
the
court
below
agreed
with
me
on
this
thing,
this
is
not
at
issue,
but
my
own
view
is
that
my
client's
land,
the
tuscarora
lands,
if
they
can
be
licensed,
are
not
subject
to
condemnation
under
section
21
but
are
subject
to
the
provisions
of
10
(e)
which
call
for
an
annual
rent.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
the
license
only
runs
for
50
years
and
the
provisions
are
with
respect
to
indian
reservation
that
at
the
end
of
20
years,
we'll
review
how
much
we're
receiving.
if
it
isn't
adequate,
we
get
more
and
if
it's
under
review
10
years
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
oh,
this
would
be
we
being
the
indian.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
paid
to
the
secretary
for
their
benefit.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
no,
there
is
none.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
in
this
case,
we
never
reached
this
question
around.
you
see
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now,
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
now,
if
--
if
--
i
understand
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
tuscarora
land
--
it
is
my
position
that
if
tuscarora
lands
can
be
taken
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
--
the
tuscarorers
will
not
get
a
lump
sum
payment
on
--
on
the
condemnation
but
rather
will
get
compensation
on
an
annual
basis
under
section
10
(e).
that
is
my
position
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
--
although
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
then
it
is
a
lump
sum
payment.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
and
this
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
very
substantial.
yes.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
at
all.
that
is
not
in
this
case
at
all.
i'm
--
i'm
just
to
say
one
other
thing.
when
i
say
my
position
here,
if
we
ever
reach
that
question
would
be
that
we
are
paid
under
10
(e).
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
not
agree
with
me
on
that.
in
a
footnote
they
indicated
otherwise
that
they
thought
the
land
would
be
condemns.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
also
said
that
this
land
could
be
condemned.
but
these
are
questions
which
we
do
not
reach
in
this
case
because
the
object,
in
fact,
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
authority
to
use
tuscarora
lands.
that
being
the
situation,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
how
we'll
compensate.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
could
not
be
made
and
the
commission
said
it
couldn't
make
them.
and
my
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
i
drafted
the
bill
and
submitted
it
to
the
power
authority.
and
the
response
that
i
got
is
the
response
which
is
given
in
footnote
5
in
my
brief
from
mr.
moses,
the
chairman
of
the
power
authority,
to
the
effect,
we
will
not
make
a
settlement
contingent
upon
passage
of
federal
legislation.
you
see,
it
was
my
position
that
the
tuscarora
nation
was
prohibited
by
law
from
selling
its
lands
in
the
absence
of
congressional
consent.
the
second
circuit
so
held,
the
court
below
so
held.
so
i
said
we
can
come
to
an
agreement
but
that
agreement
is
not
affected
until
it
is
embodied
in
federal
legislation.
and
we
came
to
an
agreement,
and
i
wrote
it
up
in
a
draft
bill
to
be
submitted
to
congress
and
the
power
authority
said,
“no,
you
must
agree
to
the
settlement
and
then
you
can
go
to
congress
and
try
and
get
some
legislation,
and
we'll
help
you,
but
we
will
be
on
your
land
at
this
point.”
and
i
said,
“well,
i
can't
do
that
in
the
face
of
two
court
of
appeals
decisions
prohibiting
me
from
doing.”
and
that
is
where
we
broke
down.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
we
--
we
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
our
land
is
not
necessary
for
the
project.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
oh,
yes,
we
had
agreed
on
all
economic
issues.
the
only
economic
issue
left
open
was
whether
we
were
going
to
get
free
electricity.
and
i
--
this,
the
power
authority
said
they
would
not
give
us
which
was
somewhat
incomprehensible
to
me
because
they
were
the
ones
who
first
offered
it.
so
--
but
except
for
that
minor
issue
which
did
not
involve
very
much
in
dollars
and
cents,
we
were
agreed
on
all
economic
issues,
and
it
was
strictly
on
this,
shall
we
say,
procedural
ground
that
we
broke
down.
and
--
and
as
i
--
as
i
say
in
my
brief,
i
couldn't
do
otherwise
because
it
was
illegal
to
do
it.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
in
that
situation,
it
would
have
gone
as
directed
by
the
legislation.
and
i
don't
think
we
reach
the
point
of
saying
whether
it
would
go
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
entrust
to
the
nation
or
whether
it
would
go
direct
to
the
nation.
we
did
have
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
when
i
talk
about
settlement
here,
settlement
is
what
lawyers
always
do
in
litigation.
you
never
know
whether
you're
going
to
win
or
loose.
and
--
and
i
got
from
my
client
what
i
thought
was
worth
the
risk
of
--
of
taking.
but
unfortunately,
it
didn't
come
about.
my
position
here
now
is
not
that
we
are
ever
going
to
settle
it,
we
get
more
money
now
because
this
court
can't
give
us
that.
my
position
here
now
is
that
we
have
a
right
to
hold
our
lands
until
congress
says
otherwise.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
and
to
live
--
and
to
live
on
their
reservation
if
they
have
for
150
years.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
--
but
our
settlement
provided,
your
honor,
that
there
will
an
alternative
land
taken
over,
that
there
will
be
(inaudible)
for
an
agreement
that
would
require
--
the
settlement
requires
that
congress
to
declare
that
the
new
land
that
would
be
acquired
to
be
officially
tuscarora
reservation.
it
doesn't
seem
we
would
not
be
giving
up
under
the
terms
of
the
settlement,
any
land.
we
will
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
--
get
land
from
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
i
just
don't
remember.
it
was
not
a
material
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
i
just
don't
remember
at
this
time.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes.
now,
i
would
like,
in
the
--
in
the
minutes
remaining
to
me,
to
deal
with
the
arguments
that
the
government
advanced
with
--
with
respect
to
the
1957
statute
in
terms
of
consent
by
implication.
now,
this
argument
is
founded
upon
three
cases,
henkel
against
united
states,
spalding
against
chandler
and
missouri,
kansas
&
texas
railway
company
against
roberts.
now,
i'd
like
to
take
the
last
one
up
first
before
it's
the
only
points
to
mine.
this
case
is
cited
by
defendant
at
page
53
and
--
pages
53
and
54
of
its
main
brief
for
the
proposition,
and
i
now
quote,
“the
taking
of
indian
reservation
land
was
authorized
by
the
grant
of
a
railroad
right
of
way
which
'necessarily
involved
their
possession'
despite
absence
of
any
showing
that
congress
had
been
aware
of
that
necessity.”
now,
without
getting
too
deeply
into
the
facts
of
the
missouri,
kansas
&
texas
railway
company
case,
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
this
treaty
of
september
29,
1865,
the
osage
nation.
now,
these
lands,
what
was
involved
in
missouri,
kansas
case
was
a
grant
of
land
to
the
state
of
kansas
in
aid
of
construction
of
a
railway.
and
that
grant
run
through
the
osage
reservation.
and
it's
the
government's
argument
that
by
necessary
implication
and
without
congressional
knowledge,
the
taking
of
the
indian
lands
is
authorized.
now,
the
grant
to
the
state
of
kansas
was
the
act
of
july
26,
1866.
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
about
nine
months
previously
in
1865,
the
osage
ceded
the
bulk
of
the
lands
covered
by
the
grant.
in
article
11
of
the
treaty
of
cession
specifically
says
“any
railroad
company,
when
the
lines
of
their
roads
necessarily
passed
through
the
lands
of
said
indians,
shall
have
the
right
of
way
upon
payment
of
fair
compensation
therefore.”
now,
this
treaty
came
up
before
the
senate
on
june
26,
1866,
that
is
30
days
before
the
grant
for
the
state
of
congress
--
state
of
kansas.
and
the
senate
amended
the
treaty
to
provide
that
the
ceded
lands
could
be
sold
under
public
landlord
and
then
they
added
this
proviso,
“including
any
act
granting
lands
to
the
state
of
kansas,
an
aid
of
the
construction
of
a
railroad
through
said
lands”.
so
my
point
here,
your
honors
is,
with
respect
to
the
missouri,
kansas
&
texas
railway
company
case
extends
for
the
exact
opposite
proposition
as
that
which
was
cited
for
by
the
government.
view
with
expressed
congressional
knowledge
and
expressed
congressional
provision
for
taking
care
of
indian
lands.
now,
the
henkel
case
is
distinguishable
on
about
half
a
dozen
grounds
which
involved
a
voluntary
sale
for
one,
for
two,
it
involved
individual
property
not
tribal
property,
for
three,
actually,
the
indians
didn't
have
any
rights,
they
hadn't
any
inequities,
and
four,
whatever
equities
they
had
where
under
a
statute
which
granted
the
united
states
the
power
to
take
the
lands
for
public
purposes.
insofar
spalding
is
concerned,
the
--
what
the
government
cited
and
dictated
to
begin
with,
in
addition
to
that,
there,
in
the
spalding
case,
we
had
a
specific
grant
of
a
specific
right
of
way
to
a
specific
company.
that
is
not
what
we
have
in
this
case.
in
this
case
we
have
just
a
mere
general
authorization
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
issue
a
license
for
non-federal
instrumentality.
so
this
dissent
by
implication
argument
as
the
government
tries
to
run
just
doesn't
exist.
there
was
no
authority
for
it.
now,
i
also
would
like
to
deal
very
briefly
with
an
argument
made
by
the
power
authority
industry
not
made
by
the
government
and
understandably
so
that
the
decision
rendered
by
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
is
somehow
binding
it
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
that
the
second
circuit
decision
would
be
related
litigation.
the
power
authority
argument
is
based
upon
a
complete
misconstruction
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
thought.
the
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
an
injunction
proceeding
against
the
appropriation
of
tuscarora
lands
while
the
review
could
be
independent
down
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
decides
and
(inaudible),
if
the
power
authority
has
a
valid
license,
it
may
be
gambling
to
get
back
to
the
question
of
10
new
york
section
21.
but
of
course,
the
basic
premise
upon
what
--
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
operating
is
not
true.
the
power
authority
is
not
a
valid
licensee
and
therefore,
anything
that
the
second
circuit
has
to
say
on
this
subject
would
--
may
go
out
of
the
window.
now,
of
course,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
when
we
came
up
with
question
of
stay
on
the
second
circuit
decision,
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
license
and
the
applicability
of
section
4
(e),
tuscarora
lands
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
the
court
below.
by
statute,
section
3
--
13
(b)
of
the
federal
power
act
which
vest
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
reviewing
court
and
of
course,
is
also
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
city
of
takoma
case.
so
that's
what
we
have
is
--
is
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
second
circuit
in
someway
foreclose
the
court
below
in
dealing
with
the
issue
in
this
case
is
just
not
based
upon
any
principle
of
law
announced
by
this
court
or
announced
by
congress.
beyond
that,
i
have
no
further
argument
in
this
court.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
work
is
--
work
is
going
on
every
place
upon
the
tuscarora
reservation.
with
respect
to
the
reservation
itself,
the
power
authority
did
get
permission
and
has
(inaudible)
along
these
road
lines.
this
is
what
we
are
trying
to
stop
when
we
asked
for
the
stay,
but
we
couldn't
get
to
it.
this
is
what
we
find
in
the
act
to
say
that
we
couldn't
(inaudible).
they
have
made
provisions
for
building
these
(inaudible)
so
that
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
(inaudible)
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
--
they
have
made
provisions
for
building
the
dikes
higher
so
that
they
could
put
in
more
water
(inaudible).
of
course,
my
point
is
they
(inaudible)
so
that
i
--
i
--
had
exactly
what
they
needed
without
taking
any
tuscarora
land.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
they're
not
using
tuscarora
land
now.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
my
point
--
my
point
is
to
saying
--
oh,
my
point
here
is
that
with
the
higher
dikes,
it's
acre-feet,
as
i
say,
is
--
is
a
function
not
only
of
circuit
but
also
of
height,
and
with
the
higher
dikes,
they
don't
need
(inaudible)
if
they
use
the
higher
dikes
(inaudible)
even
if
they
get
tuscarora
land,
that's
our
point
here.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
my
opinion.
i
think
it's
about
all
(inaudible)
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
because
i
think
--
because
i
think
they
can
build
it
elsewhere.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
but
did
--
did
i
--
i
do
not
have
the
facts
on
it,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
i
--
i
deduce
it
from
what
--
from
what
the
power
authority
had
said
in
its
brief
with
respect
to
what
has
to
be
done
even
if
it
state
its
want,
and
they
talk
about
new
application
before
the
power
authority
and
they
talk
about
the
higher
dikes
and
from
this,
i
conclude
that
if
they
didn't
want
to
use
or
they
didn't
want
the
--
the
reservoir
(inaudible),
but
i
conclude
it
has
the
authority
to
build
along
here
and
has
it
possible
to
build
the
dike
15
feet
high
which
gives
them
that
many
thousand
more
acre-feet
of
water.
so
there
is
no
sense
in
taking
1,383
acres
(inaudible)
get
the
50,000
feet
reservoir
by
taking
let's
say
300
or
400
acres.
but
of
course,
that
is
the
--
the
basic
--
the
basic
position
here
is
that
the
tuscarorers
are
standing
on
their
right,
as
you
say
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
remain
in
the
peaceful
use
and
occupation
of
their
reservation
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
land.
and
they
are
standing
on
their
right
to
stay
there
until
congress
tells
them
that
they
have
to
get
out
and
congress
has
not
yet
told
them
that
that
is
the
case.
