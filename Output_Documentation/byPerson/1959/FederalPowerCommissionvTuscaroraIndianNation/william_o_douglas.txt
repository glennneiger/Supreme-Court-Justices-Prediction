justice
william
o.

now,
the
commission,
in
its
opinion
as
i
remember,
said
that
if
the
indian
lands
were
not
available,
that
there
were
alternative
lands.
could
you
point
out
where
those
are?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
at
the
first
hearing.
justice
william
o.
douglas
some
tribal
lands
not
owned
by
the
united
states?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
there
are.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
you
argue.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but,
the
united
states,
as
i
gathered,
would
have
some
guardianship
interest
as
respects
those
tribal
lands
that
are
not
owned
by
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
mean
that
the
government
will
concede
it
too?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
the
problem
is
whether
the
guardianship
interest
in
tribal
lands
not
owned
by
the
united
states
is
an
interest
in
section
3
(2).
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
you
say,
no
because
you
make
the
word
other,
there's
a
burden
of
saying
they
must
be
owned.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
--
i
think
if
you
say
that
interest
means
property
interest.
justice
william
o.
douglas
interest
in
land.
