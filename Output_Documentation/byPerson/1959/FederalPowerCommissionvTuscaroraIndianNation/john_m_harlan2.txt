justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
because
they
made
a
mistake
initially
or
because
they'd
allowed
to
break
the
procedure
to
point
where
in
order
to
reserver
to
alternative
lands,
they
would
have
--
it'd
cost
them
a
lot
more
money?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
does
the
government
see?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
effort
in
the
last
congress
after
this
dispute
arose
that's
been
going
on
since
the
day
that
i
was
connected
with
it,
with
the
stay,
are
you
active
at
that
time?
is
there
any
effort
made
to
get
this
ambiguity
cleared
up?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
congress
claimed
that
we
know
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
they
get
right
at
a
task
and
show
its
statute
and
so
the
litigation
disappear
wouldn't
it
if
they
chose
to
do
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
--
no
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
their
argument
is
really
an
argument
from
necessity,
clearly
in
this
branch
of
the
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
argument
from
necessity.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
assuming
you
would
prevail
on
this
suit
here,
in
this
case
that
we're
hearing
and
arguing,
that
validates
the
license,
then,
your
--
there
is
still
another
question
there,
as
to
whether
even
though
the
license
is
valid
as
a
power
to
condemn
the
being
--
at
least
being
indian
lands,
do
we
reach
that
question
in
this
lawsuit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
i'm
assuming
that
you
--
you
are
prevailed
for
the
moment
on
saying
that
this
is
not
a
reservation
so
incidentally,
you
don't
have
to
have
the
finding
so
that
you've
got
a
valid
license
or
now
you've
got
a
valid
license.
then,
it
has
to
resort
to
section
21,
hasn't
it,
to
condemn,
to
get
the
land?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
license
itself
does
not
give
any
power
to
condemn.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you've
got
the
same
question
under
section
21,
haven't
you,
as
to
whether
or
not
section
21
in
broad
terms
say
nothing
about
indian
reservations,
indian
lands
and
is
sufficient
to
give
that
authority.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
moore,
your
time
is
up.
but
i
--
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
which
i
think
you
can
answer
(inaudible).
i
suppose
this
record
clearly
indicates
that
there's
at
least
a
very
grave
doubt
about
whether
the
statute
justifies
what
has
been
done.
you
would
agree
with
that,
wouldn't
you?
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
court
below
has
decided
against
you.
i
would
suppose
you
would
say
that
it's
at
least
not
wholly
and
completely
and
unequivocally
clear.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
--
i'm
just
curious
to
know
why
under
these
circumstances,
if
it's
--
if
the
congress
did
intend
to
do
this,
i
don't
know
what
or
where
i
stand
on
this.
but
if
the
congress
did
intend
to
do
that,
why
--
if
this
is
an
urgent
matter,
why
there
has
not
been
some
effort
made
on
the
part
of
new
york
or
the
department
of
justice
to
have
a
congress
action?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know.
i
was
getting
back
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
all
i'm
--
all
i'm
interested
in
as
it
seems
to
me
that
frequently,
we
are
here
to
--
to
construe
a
statute
one
way
or
the
other
for
the
government
and/or
against
the
government
where
the
statement
is
made
and
it's
pretty
clear
that
congress
intended
to
do
that.
we've
got
to
decide
where
they
didn't.
and
nobody
makes
any
effort
to
get
congress
to
decide
it
for
us,
because
it's
congress'
power
after
all,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
not
think
of
what
is
advisable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
but,
i'm
not
talking
about
counsel
passed
to
the
legislation.
i'm
talking
about
the
counselor
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
it'd
take
you
longer
to
get
congress
to
say
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
it'd
take
longer
if
you
--
for
you
--
for
you
to
get
congress
to
say
that
it
meant
what
you
say
--
that
it
undoubtedly
meant
that
what
you
go
and
run
to
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
--
i
mean
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
which
part
of
the
--
what
conditions
in
the
federal
power
act
you
are
relying
on
when
you
get
over
this
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
point
is
that
that
is
a
licensing
condition.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
getting
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
why
do
you
have
to
go
any
further
than
licensing
conditions.
maybe
it's
the
theory
of
your
argument
but
haven't
just
understood
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
argument
here
is
that
that
is
the
licensing
condition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that's
all
you
relied?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
if
i
may,
just
what
is
your
argument,
the
point
you
are
seeking
to
establish
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
the
commission
--
are
you
arguing
that
even
if
the
commission
made
the
finding
required
by
4
(e)
that
it's
--
it
could
not
have
taken
the
indian
lands?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
suppose
it
could
make
it?
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
commission
didn't
have
to
make
the
finding,
what's
your
position
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
following
the
government's
position
here
prevails,
i'm
not
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
it
will,
but
i'm
putting
the
question
to
you.
then,
what
is
you
view,
what
is
your
--
what
is
your
position
then
if
it
didn't
have
to
make?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
question
--
that's
the
question
that
would
be
reached
in
the
appeal
that
we're
not
hearing
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
which
you
consider
that
question
would
be
before
us
here
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
are
the
appendixes
in
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
