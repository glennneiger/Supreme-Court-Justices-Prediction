mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
it
go
up
to
the
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
they
all
come
before
the
congress,
didn't
they
--
didn't
they
balance
off
those
things?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
project
of
that
kind
--
any
familiarity
with
the
character
of
the
lands
to
be
submerged
and
--
and
what
they're
to
cost
--
there's
a
great
bearing
on
the
feasibility
of
the
--
of
the
project.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
--
i'm
just
surprised
that
congress
never
knew
about
--
about
this
indian
reservation
land
it
was
to
--
it
was
to
take
that
before
it
enacted
the
public
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
before
you
get
to
the
--
that
you
get
off
of
this
subject,
would
you
compare
that
topography
as
the
portion
of
the
tuscarora
reservation
that
they
take
for
the
reservoir
with
that
which
remains?
this
--
that
is
the
reservation
which
we
(inaudible).
in
other
words
we
want
it
with
tillable
soil
or
one
part
of
the
tillable
soil,
and
the
other
mountain
--
mountainous
or
what
is
--
is
it
all
the
same?
or
--
or
what
is
the
relationship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it's
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
give
you
just
one
more
question
please
that
you
might
answer
with
the
other.
in
the
land
off
to
the
left
and
below
the
proposed
reservoir
site
you
said
was
infeasible.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
as
so
far
as
you're
concerned,
so
why
is
that
infeasible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
i
--
i
think
you
have
one
or
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
you
may
have
10
minutes
for
rebuttal
and
the
counsel
if
you
made
it,
you
may
have
10
minutes
at
your
time
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh
yes
you
--
you
may.
i
--
well,
yes.
come
on
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
did.
you
--
it
wasn't
your
fault
i'm
sure.
yes,
indeed.
you
may
take
--
you
may
take
your
five.
i
don't
rather
--
you
can.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
it
show
--
did
show
those
400
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
didn't
show
anything
as
to
the
character
of
the
land
to
be
taken?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lazarus,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
do
we
find
that
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer
that
after
lunch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
if
the
power
commission
found
that
this
was
the
only
way
that
all
of
this
water
could
be
used
or
does
it
find
that
this
was
the
best
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lazarus,
i
--
i
was
going
to
ask
you
this.
the
counsel
in
his
last
few
remarks
said
that
the
reason,
one
of
the
reasons
at
least,
why
there
were
no
congressional
action
sought
this
last
year
was
because
you
--
you
and
--
and
your
people
and
the
authority
could
not
agree
upon
a
--
a
bill.
what
was
the
difference
of
opinion,
just
generally
speaking,
what
was
--
if
--
if
there
was
such
a
difference?
was
it
this
difference
between
condemnation
and
license
fee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
your
--
under
your
proposal,
the
--
the
authority
would
have
gotten
the
use
of
this
--
of
this
land
and
then
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
project
would
not
have
been
retarded.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
i
was
just
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
substantially
the
same.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
i
was
interested
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
part
of
the
reservation
unless
congress
made
it
so,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
pardon
me,
i
am
just
going
to
ask
this,
general,
mr.
lazarus
said
that
there
were
a
very
few
economic
differences
between
the
parties,
and
that
the
main
thing
they're
interested
in
was
to
getting
this
--
this
land
attached
to
and
becoming
a
part
of
the
reservation
if
they
gave
up
this
--
this
land
that
--
that
the
authority
wants.
what
--
what
objection
would
there
be
to
doing
that
by
congressional
acts
and
i'm
wondering?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
--
they
referred
was
that
if
the
intention
of
congress
to
permit
this
land
to
be
taken
is
as
clear
as
the
authority
of
the
government
believe
that
it
is,
why
wouldn't
--
why
wouldn't
congress
be
willing
to
take
care
of
this
situation
by
this,
this
objection
with
these
things
that
you
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
yes.
