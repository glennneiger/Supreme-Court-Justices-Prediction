you
say
we
get
more,
who
gets
more.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
they
never
get
the
actual
money
except
that
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
applies
it
or
goes
it
out
to
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
then
the
difference
as
far
as
the
indians
are
concerned
assuming
now
the
government
can
get
these
lands
or
the
power
authority
can
for
the
purposes
of
this
project?
if
this
would've
be,
by
condemnation,
would
be
a
lump
sum
payment,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
just
trying
--
put
in
--
make
this
hypothetical.
it's
--
if
the
--
if
there
could
be
condemnation
here,
there
would
be
a
lump
sum
payment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
there
cannot
be
and
yet
they
may
be
utilized
for
the
project,
i
gather,
you
say
10
(e)
applies
and
the
indians
will
get
x
dollars
over
whatever
period
of
year,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
was
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
understand
that,
but
suppose
they're
wrong
and
suppose
they
may
be
taken
at
condemnation,
then
it's
a
lump
sum
payment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
difference
between
the
two
sums
maybe
very
great.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
we're
fighting
about
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
--
definitely,
it
had
to
got
that
legislation.
had
you
proceeded
far
enough
to
reach
something
like
an
agreement
on
the
price
that
which
it
served?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
may
i
ask,
if
that
agreement
has
ever
been
consummated
and
the
purchase
price
to
pay
it
again,
to
whom
would
it
have
gone?

william
j.
