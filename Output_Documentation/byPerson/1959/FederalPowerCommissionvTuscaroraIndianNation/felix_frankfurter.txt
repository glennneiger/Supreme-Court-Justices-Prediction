the
conflict
--
i
thought
it
said
--
it
isn't
a
conflict
between
this
act
and
rules
of
practical
and
procedure
according
to
your
statement.
but
in
the
event
--
but
in
the
event
of
any
conflict,
from
what
you
tell
us,
this
is
intended
to
preclude
reference
to
the
general
power
act
if
there'll
be
a
conflict
between
that
and
this
specific
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
show
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
your
suggestion.
but
since
this
is
a
grant
of
the
--
this
is
a
specialized
--
making
a
special
grant,
this
act
defines
the
--
the
grant
and
its
limitations,
if
i
say
that.
but
that
would
be
by
implication
but
--
but
if
you
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
section
2
refers
to
a
conflict,
and
i
was
just
wondering
whether
the
conflict
referred
to
is
not
the
conflict
between
this
act
and
rules
of
practice
rather
than
conflict
between
this
act
and
the
original
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
--
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
rests
on
the
--
the
--
on
the
contention,
the
natural
contention
that
this
covers
all
there
is
to
be
covered
regarding
the
scope
of
what
is
granted
and
what
is
denied
in
the
grant
as
against
the
--
the
generalized
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
am
merely
suggesting
that
it
couldn't
be
reinforced,
that
that
couldn't
be
reinforced
by
referring
to
the
specific
suggestion
that
a
conflict,
if
there'd
be
one,
shall
make
this
act
controlling,
because
if
the
conflict,
as
i
read
in
section
2,
the
conflict
that's
contemplated
and
the
conflict
in
this
act
and
the
rules
you're
conforming
it
to
which,
this
grant
must
be
exercised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
--
your
argument
is,
this
is
a
self-contained
act
which
must
be
looked
--
which
must
be
looked
to
ascertain
what
is
granted,
the
conditions
of
it,
the
limitations
of
it,
and
the
procedure
required.
that's
your
general
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
there
--
the
reasons
there
shall
be
--
shall
be
among
the
rules
or
something
that
would
apply
to
what
the
act
does,
then
the
rules
would
we'd
have
to
live
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
engineers
in
their
--
in
their
plan
or
programs
go
into
the
details
of
what
reservoirs
would
be
needed
as
the
source
of
the
land
in
which
the
reservoir
is
to
be
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
they
consult
with
the
tuscarora?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
provision
did
they
make
for
the
reservoir?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean,
they
--
they
made
provision
for
a
smaller
reservoir?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
be
who,
the
new
york
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
explaining
to
me
the
--
what
the
bearing
of
the
displacement
or
the
rebuttal
of
the
--
shows
that
the
plant
was
the
need
of
a
larger
reservoir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
this
release
for
water
to
be
used
by
the
--
by
the
by
the
new
york
project?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
a
matter
of
interest,
am
i
right
in
inferring
that
when
the
schoellkopf
thing
fell
into
the
bottom
of
the
river,
niagara
mohawk
was
out.
not
only
physically
out
but
(inaudible).
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
am
i
wrong
in
--
in
leading
of
members
that
then
uphold,
the
engineers,
when
they
go
into
these
details
of
such
a
project,
they
really
go
into
these
details
with
some
particularity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
--
and
if
that
been
so,
how
do
you
come
to
the
fact
that
what
the
engineers
--
or,
is
it
the
time
that
they
didn't
go
into
the
--
into
the
requirements
of
tuscarora
lands?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
the
time
element?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
--
when
did
the
requirement
of
taking
indian
land
explicitly
first
emerge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
won't
get
--
you
haven't
yet
mentioned
when
the
tuscarora
by
name
emerged
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
potential
--
potential
taking,
when
did
that
first
emerge?
either
in
congress
or
out
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
first
formed,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
new
york
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
new
york
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
these
villages
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
showed
it
as
being
contemplated
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
this
--
if
this
merely
square,
that
the
tuscarora
square
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
in
the
same
kind
of
ownership
that
the
land
to
the
right
about,
as
mr.
chief
justice
is
asking
you.
but,
we
wouldn't
be
here
in
the
question,
would
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
then
it
would
be
a
question
of
--
of
judgment
before
the
commission
as
to
which
one
it
should
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we're
here
because
this
free
land
existed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
has
a
--
has
a
quality
namely
it
belongs
to
indians.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that's
it.
that
really
raises
the
legal
question,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
fully
contend
that
congress,
or
is
it,
that
congress
couldn't
having
to
have
drawn
upon
indian
lands
as
part
of
the
lands
to
be
condemned
for
the
purpose
of
this
project?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
also
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
that
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
arguably,
does
that
mean
there's
clearly
no
agreeable
alternative?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
kind
of
a
geographic
definition,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that
that's
--
are
you
as
close
to
that
in
this
case
namely
the
longest
line
--
it's
the
general
kind
of
a
geographic
identification
of
these
lands?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
rightly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that
earlier
that
the
--
the
land
the
right.
you
said
that
take
that
that
involved
a
disruption
on
the
city
of
lewiston,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
later
on
you
said
that
it
would
mean
--
mean
the
displacement
of
327
homes
or
others.
is
that
what
you
mean
by
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
439?
does
that
mean
that
i
should
--
are
those
two
identical
statements
in
the
instruction
of
its
immunity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
not
involve
splitting
the
city
into
two,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
(inaudible)
what
taking
these
tuscarora
lands
means
to
the
tuscarora
tribe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
any
physical
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
total
population
of
the
tuscarora?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
are
there
any
--
is
there
any
bearing
in
taking
these
lands
under
feelings
of
what
their
reservation
is,
what
they've
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
can
enjoy
the
kind
of
impossible
way
when
people
enjoy
in
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
a
logical
question.
it's
very
important
particularly
in
the
life
indian
tribes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
you
say,
they
have
no
legal
merits,
the
question
is
whether
those
factors
have
a
legal
relevance
in
the
--
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
contemplate
--
contemplate
in
this
court
and
yet
there's
no
problem
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
constitutional
power
problem
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
add
as
a
footnote
to
justice
harlan's
question,
namely,
your
argument
is
one
of
the
necessity.
if
congress
had
spoken
clearly,
it
would
be
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
at
all.
therefore,
the
question
is
construction
of
the
statute
to
allow
the
exercise
of
discretion
which
if
the
power
commission
had
it,
it
isn't
for
us
to
revise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
necessity
means
in
this
connection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
the
necessity
for
the
--
for
carrying
out
the
project,
and
when
congress
authorized
the
carrying
out
of
the
project
presumably,
it
carried
with
it
all
appropriate
means
for
making
the
project
possible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
so
we
get
back
to
the
statute
really
whether
there's
anything
--
any
limitation
within
the
statute
which
excluded
that.
it's
--
isn't
that
the
ultimate
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
quite
take
in
what
you
--
how
did
we
dispose
off
tribal
lands
embraced
within
indian
reservations,
you
say
that
to
be
a
tribal
land
owned
by
the
united
states
and
set
aside
as
an
indian
reservation,
is
that
the
way
you
read
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
lost
me,
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
into
(1),
it
says,
“public
lands
means
such
and
interest
so
and
so,
it
shall
not
include
“reservation”,
as
hereinafter
defined.”
you
--
you
read
that
to
mean
include
reservations
that
are
public
land
of
the
united
states
in
(1)?
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
include
reservation?
now
is
that
a
--
and
then
if
you
find
the
reservation
in
(2).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
a
self
contained
definition
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
reservation
means
national
forest,
i
understand
that.
what
i
like
your
comment
on
is
--
is
tribal
lands
embraced
within
indian
reservations.
you
exclude
the
tuscarora.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
tribal
lands,
quote
from
that,
tribal
lands
that
are
owned
by
the
united
states
but
are
set
aside
as
indian
reservation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
way
you
read
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
phrase
says.
it
says,
“tribal
lands
embraced
within
indian
reservations”,
“and
other
lands
and
interest
in
lands
owned
by
the
united
states.”
now,
your
argument
must
be
that
tribal
lands
not
owned
by
the
united
states
are
not
other
land
owned
by
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
say
that
makes
other
to
have
whole
burden
of
your
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
my
view.
my
view
is
that
tribal
lands
--
not
my
view
but
my
trouble
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
reservation
means
natural
forest,
1-
national
forest.
2-
tribal
lands
embraced
within
indian
reservations.
that's
with
the
law,
that
would
characterize
it
as
the
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
3-
military
reservations,
4-
and
other
lands
and
interest
in
lands.
now
--
what
you
view
is
to
characterized
--
is
to
qualify
proof
by
what
i
call
four,
and
other
lands,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but,
that's
how
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
say
that
those
aren't
four
subject
categories
all
of
which
would
fall
under
reservation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
reservation
in
the
--
in
indian
--
as
to
indian
rather,
is
a
very
defined
characteristic
to
make
sure
of
a
holding
or
an
interest,
i
think
the
burden
is
heavily
on
the
government
that
and
other
lands
means
tribal
lands
that
are
other
lands
owned
by
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
in
the
1920,
and
i
have
had
provisions
to
remember
that
there
is
or
earliest
with
the
power
development,
do
you
think
that
there
was
the
question
whether
the
government
would
grant
licenses
on
indian
--
of
regarding
land
that
there
were
then
indian
reservation
for
the
use
of
government,
did
not
have
ownership?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
they
have
--
wouldn't
they
have
the
general
relations
to
indians
the
power,
if
you
can
--
the
power
to
condemn,
the
power
to
make
the
subordinates
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
you
a
further
question
about
this
reservation?
the
proviso
requires
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
or
is
it
the
secretary
of
the
department
who
use
the
provisions,
et
cetera.
of
course,
it
might
be
(inaudible).
but
dealing
with
indians
and
dealing
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
it
provides
that
he
must
have
--
he
may
lay
down
the
condition
for
the
purpose
of
protection
of
such
reservation.
so
that
they
shouldn't
have
to
be
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
which
such
reservation
was
created
or
acquired.
now,
isn't
that
a
fact
that
the
interest
of
indians
as
a
--
as
a
tribe,
as
a
community,
the
interest
of
the
indians
are
the
same
whether
they
own
the
land
outside
in
fee
or
whether
they
enjoy
the
land
owned
by
the
united
states
so
far
as
indian
interest
are
concerned.
the
interest
is
substantially
the
same
except
they
owe
the
man
in
one
case
and
enjoy
the
other,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
course,
i'd
like
to
know
that
therefore
your
--
your
argument
makes
the
difference
turned
on,
on
the
fact
of
ownership,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
if
there's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ownership
for
law
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
interest
to
be
--
to
be
protected.
and
you
say
that
because
there's
no
reference
that
the
power
exhibit
--
was
to
exhibit
otherwise
then
ownership
by
the
united
states
for
the
commerce
clause,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
section
21
of
the
general
power
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
we
are
told
--
but
this
is
an
independent
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
this
particularization
was
really
needless
if
they
just
said
all
lands
owned
by
the
united
states.
that
would
cover
everything,
you
must
get
permission
by
the
appropriate
cabinet
member
who
has
control
of
it
in
giving
reasons
or
rather
laying
down
conditions
of
protecting
the
interest
that
is
there.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
way
you
read
it.
you
say
that
this
is
just
a
needless
enumeration
of
lands
owned
by
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
true?
suppose
it
was
just
all
lands
owned
by
the
united
states
that
was
covered
in
(voice
overlap)
to
include
these
and
all
lands,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
then
i
change
my
mind.
they
say,
all
reservations
owned
by
the
government
which
carry
everyone
--
to
carry
all
the
enumeration
of
(2),
is
that
right?
that's
all
even
a
post
office,
if
there
is
a
reservation
for
the
use
of
the
post
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
wouldn't
it
be
shown
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
191?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
tends
(inaudible)
that
my
stupid
eye
just
doesn't
indicate
you
guessed
that,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
that's
not
exhibit
191,
is
it?
that's
not
191.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page

justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
two
exhibits
i
see.
that's
a
whole
series
of
things.
page

it's
right.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
money
is
the
only
test
of
fairness,
if
money
is
the
only
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
really
mean
that
the
question
is
whether
congress
either
explicitly
or
by
implication
specifically
authorized
the
taking
of
the
tuscarora
land.
you
don't
mean
that,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says,
“the
conditions
we've
been
granting
the
license,
it
is
explicit
as
to
what
it
takes
over,
namely
there
are
general
provisions
in
granting
a
license
which
have
behind
them
the
general
public
purposes
which
the
federal
power
act
was
tasked
and
at
present
much
had
those
and
(inaudible)
have
some
additional
ones.
that
doesn't
mean
you
must
--
that
this
incorporates
every
provision
of
the
federal
power
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
all
it
does,
that's
all
it
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
go
through
any
other
provision
of
federal
power
act
in
order
to
find
the
scope
of
this
act
or
the
limitations
of
this
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
that's
exactly
what
i
don't
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
where
do
you
find
--
what's
the
justification
for
that
statement
that
you've
just
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
federal
power
act
isn't
exhausted
through
its
enumerations
of
the
licensing
conditions.
there
are
amount
of
other
things
in
the
federal
power
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
are
not
included.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
why
congress
didn't
say
so
and
just
limited
itself
to
the
licensing
conditions?
it
could
very
easily
have
said
in
conformity
with
the
federal
power
act.
that
is
not
what
it
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
using
a
phrase
which
is
not
accurate.
the
government
says,
there
are
provisions
in
the
federal
power
act.
it
says
the
licensing
condition
which
is
only
a
part
of
the
federal
power
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
the
generality
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
history
of
taking
of
indian
lands?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
history?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
indian
lands
have
not
been
condemned
apart
from
treaty
and
apart
from
explicit
authorization
by
name
in
statutes.
are
you
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
it
couldn't
make
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
because
it
would
have
to
be
made
by
the
secretary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
whole
case
of
united
states,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
that
act
made
a
draft
or
authorized
a
plan
to
be
made
and
the
practically,
the
feasibly,
the
appropriately
effective
and
only
effective
way
of
carrying
out
that
which
the
act
of
1957
contemplated
was
to
include
portion
of
the
tuscarora
reservation.
needless
to
say,
i'm
not
contesting
that
i
agree
with
that
but
that's
the
case
and
that's
the
case
that
has
to
be
met.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
talking
about
what
counsel
to
the
power
authority
said
in
his
last
remark.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
he
also
said
in
map
that's
been
before
the
committee
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
said
it
was
that
it
included
that
territory,
it
didn't
have
the
label?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
he
might
deduce
that
those
lands
were
necessary
and
the
fact
that
they
were
indians
doesn't
make
them
any
of
the
less
method
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
doesn't
it
depend
in
what
connection
that
problem
arises,
it's
now
that
the
generality
like
that
is
healthy
to
construe
the
specific
provisions,
bearing
as
it
does,
on
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
subject
matter
of
a
statute,
they
intrinsically
make
what
you
call
an
exception
is
an
exception
of
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
agree
with
it,
i'm
just
saying
that
i
probably
(inaudible)
with
indians
of
any
problem,
don't
get
much
help
out
of
these
generalities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
well
understand
--
i
well
understand
and
appreciate,
i
think,
that
where
congress
deals
with
indian
legislation,
where
it
is
concerned
with
indian
power
or
interest,
reservation
interest,
that
the
generality
which
you
invoked
is
relevant
and
conclusive,
but
in
this
statute,
it
wasn't
dealing
with
indian
problem,
it
was
dealing
with
another
kind
of
category,
namely,
what
--
as
to
what
lands,
regarding
what
land
permission
must
be
given
to
exercise
the
power
of
eminent
domain
which,
without
such
permission,
wouldn't
exist.
and
therefore,
the
problem
with
legislation
was
not
vis-à-vis
indians
but
vis-à-vis
government
lands.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
have
that
without
having
a
fee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
goes
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
--
as
i
understand
it,
do
i
understand
it
correctly
that
you're
not
claiming
here,
you're
not
with
this
statute
the
--
this
license
on
the
ground
that
the
practicality
would
show
if
it
were
done
one
way,
it
would
be
more
profitable
to
describe
that
--
that
it
would
have
done
this
way.
you're
standing
on
your
legal
right
not
to
have
this
land
condemned
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
an
abstract
--
as
an
abstract
legal
proposition
on
which
you
have
a
right
to
stand.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
your
--
your
whole
long,
long
try
part
of
it
of
indian
interest,
like
myself,
you're
not
making
any
arguments
of
any
damage
that
would
be
done
with
the
indians,
an
interest
that
would
be
equal
inference
except
their
right
to
have
the
law
of
the
land.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
they
wouldn't
be
leaving
it
for
a
settlement
it
had
gone
through.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
be
giving
up
this
land
for
a
price,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
made
ever
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
the
--
what
did
you
say
a
minute
ago
about
they
couldn't
use
the
tuscarora
land
ever?
what
did
you
say
it
was,
in
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you
said
they
couldn't
be
using
it.
i
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mthe
provision
is
about
two
thirds
moot,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that
is
--
that
wouldn't
make
it
moot
[laughter],
but
according
to
your
statement
if
what
you
say
is
so,
it's
physically
two
thirds
moot,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
stated
some
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tuscarora
stands
on
the
right,
the
government
stands
on
the
right,
the
most
stand
on
the
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody
stands
on
the
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
--
thought
i
was
describing
very
accurately
the
situation.
