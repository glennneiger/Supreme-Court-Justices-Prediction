mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
pray
if
it
please
the
court,
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
impinge
upon
the
solicitor
general's
rebuttal
time,
but
there
a
few
items
to
which
i
respectively
invite
your
attention.
first,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
two
or
three
questions.
mr.
justice
harlan's
first
question,
i
answer
equivocally
--
unequivocally
about
it,
no,
the
need
for
this
land
does
not
come
about
since
the
license
is
valid.
the
need
for
this
land
does
not
come
about
as
a
result
of
anything
that's
occurring
through
the
congress'
action.
that's
number
one.
number
two,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
when
the
need
for
the
land
was
ascertained
and
publicized
really.
the
need
for
the
land
came
about
as
follows.
the
schoellkpf
plant
fell
in
the
river
in
--
on
june
8
i
think
it
was
1956.
there
were
congress
--
hearing
from
the
house
shortly
thereafter
but
--
but
pretty
much
beside
the
point
except
that
it
was
testimony
there.
now,
where
it
was
pointed
out
at
those
hearings,
in
the
summer
in
1946,
the
prior
plan
for
the
whole
project
had
to
be
scrapped
and
increased
in
size.
and
then,
the
record
shows
that
in
the
fall
of
1956,
the
power
authority
made
a
brand
new
study
and
as
the
result
of
the
brand
new
study
ascertained
that
in
order
to
use
all
the
waters
of
the
river
available
to
the
united
states
a
60,000
acre-foot
reservoir
was
needed
and
that
indian
land
was
needed.
as
a
result
of
that
study
in
1956,
a
--
a
report
including
a
map
was
brought
out
and
that's
the
exhibit
191
of
the
--
which
the
solicitor
general
has
been
talking
about.
but
what
i
want
to
make
clear
is
that
that
map,
that
exhibit
was
before
congress.
the
exhibit
191
which
was
a
map
of
the
new
project,
was
planned
by
the
power
authority
did
include
tuscarora
land.
no
question
about
that.
it
was
not
to
label
tuscarora
land
as
the
solicitor
general
said.
the
roads
were
shown
and
definitely
included
in
the
border
of
the
reservoir
was
tuscarora
land.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
they
didn't
show
it
properly.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
well,
it
is
in
the
--
it
wasn't
that
kind
of
map.
but
they
didn't
--
and
besides
that,
while
it
shows
military
road
(inaudible),
i
think
it
may
--
this
is
the
city
of
niagara
falls
and
the
niagara
university
is
here.
and
it
showed
north
has
been
labelled
military
road
and
the
label
we
could
show
to
this
other
road
and
shows
that
the
reservoir
is
between
the
other
road.
and
that's
--
that
was
the
kind
of
map
it
was,
it
was
a
general
map.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
no.
it
didn't
show
how
in
this
map.
it
did
not.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
essentially
not.
well,
there's
an
exhibit
here.
you
can
see
it
right
--
in
--
it's
in
the
record
is
what
--
it's
exhibit
191
in
the
record,
here
is
a
picture.
but,
now,
the
house
that
--
that
report,
now
the
senate
report
that
board
report,
the
--
the
senate
didn't
hold
any
hearings
in
1957,
but
it
was
after
it
that
the
senate
held
hearing.
and
the
senate
referred
--
incidentally,
this
was
before
the
senate,
that's
in
the
record,
they
looked
at
it,
the
members
of
the
committee.
but
then,
the
senate
report,
in
talking
about
this
project,
said
that
the
latest,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
latest
plan
was
the
plan
developed
by
the
power
authority,
it
was
developed
in
that
exhibit.
and
--
that's
in
the
report
and
now
--
now
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
--
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
191.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
well,
i
just
--
page
23
of
the
record
of
the
--
of
the
exhibit
--
of
the
--
of
the
two
pictures
of
this
one.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
there's
--
there's
two
volumes.
there's
a
volume
of
exhibits.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
(inaudible)
42
again
--
it's
42.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
now,
they
are
--
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
this
--
this
plan,
this
map
that
was
in
the
niagara
falls
newspaper.
it
was
given
to
the
tuscarora.
it
was
discussed
with
the
tuscarora
all
before
the
senate
hearings
in
1957.
in
other
words,
this
plan
of
the
power
authority
was
an
open
and
notorious
during
the
time.
no
question
about
that
at
all.
but
it
was
not
like
(inaudible).
now,
i
want
to
point
out
two
other
things
too.
that
is
that
congress,
now
when
it
set
this
law
on
1957,
i
think
you
could
assume
--
i
think
you've
got
a
right
to
assume,
it
knew
that
new
york
state
throughout
its
history,
now,
this
is
no
state
right
to
arguing
at
all.
but
the
new
york
state
throughout
its
history
had
been
condemning
indian
lands
and
its
waters
for
public
purposes.
it
has
done
that
since
the
beginning.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
testimony
in
the
record
that
new
york
claimed
to
have
the
right
to
condemn
all
the
lands
in
the
forest,
and
i
am
talking
about
indians
not
necessary
for
the
power,
private.
i
think
you
have
to
consider
that,
and
that
there's
a
cabinet
consent
by
congress
throughout
the
years
to
new
york
exercising
the
power
in
its
domain
over
indian
lands,
and
it's
done
it
all
through
the
years.
now
i
think
that
you
have
to
consider
that.
now,
two
more
things,
and
i'll
set
down.
one
is
there's
no
question
of
fairness
in
this
case.
no
question
at
all.
the
solicitor
general
said,
the
offer
was
$2,400,000
actually
it
got
up
to
$3,000,000.
and
the
new
houses,
everything
is
better,
adjoining
land
on
the
other
end,
that
isn't
an
element
in
this
case
at
all.
i
mean,
all
the
kinds
of
--
there
is
no
problem
about
the
fairness
to
the
indians
as
involved
here
in
any
way
shape
or
manner.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
it's
more
than
that,
sir.
this
reservation,
the
record
shows
is
not
used.
it
was
used
very
little.
there
is
only
one
real
farm
on
the
whole
reservation.
any
standard
of
fairness
at
all,
except
perhaps
to
the
one
that
you're
talking
about
that
an
indian
would
say,
“well
if
they
take
this
from
me
now,
maybe
--
maybe
they'll
take
some
more
later”,
i
mean,
not
in
exception.
but
--
but
they
could
get
more
land
on
the
other
side,
much
better
if
they
wanted
it,
no
--
no
problem
about
that.
and
incidently
sir,
this
is
not
only
purchased
land,
but
this
land
has
enjoyed
a
tax
abatement
as
a
result
of
a
statute
passed
on
new
york
state,
not
by
congress,
in
1821
and
regarding
to
this
--
and
this
has
always
been,
and
i'm
not
arguing
state
rights
again
now
either.
but
regarding
to
these
indians,
it's
always
been
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
it
has
never
been
in
the
government
of
the
united
states.
the
government
nearly
hasn't
done
anything
from
this
people.
they
give
two
and
a
half
yards
(inaudible)
a
year
to
these
indians
and
that's
all.
new
york
educates
them.
new
york
provides
doctors
and
nurses
for
them,
schools
on
their
reservation,
everything
that's
done
all
through
the
years
by
new
york
state.
and
even
back
in
worcester
against
georgia,
the
court
was
probably
said
georgia
had
no
rights
over
indians
at
all,
it
did
indicate
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
--
of
the
united
states
from
what
the
situation
was
in
georgia
because
of
them.
but
i
--
i
do
think
you
have
to
keep
that
in
mind.
and
one
other
thing
sure
is
this,
and
that
is
the
power
authority
presents
very
strong
in
the
argument
that
the
litigation
in
the
second
circuit
as
defined
on
this
court
of
appeals
below,
it
should
have
been
honored.
now,
in
this
case,
we
--
the
--
the
first
part
was
pointed
out
by
solicitor
general,
the
order
which
is
under
review
here
did
not
include
indian
land
in
the
project.
the
court
--
the
commission
refused
to
pass
on
it.
the
commission
--
and
so
that
--
so
we
maintain
that
the
--
that
the
respondent
was
not
agreed
as
a
result
of
that
order.
but
in
any
event,
right
after
rehearing
was
denied
on
that
order,
the
respondents
started
a
declaratory
judgment
and
the
injunction
action
in
new
york
state
before
the
court
below
got
jurisdiction
by
the
filing
with
it
of
the
commission's
transcript
of
judgment
--
transcript
to
the
record,
there
was
actually
a
judgment
in
the
--
declaratory
judgment
injunction
action
affirmed
as
modified
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
now,
i
do
point
out
to
you
sirs
that
in
this
--
in
respondent's
brief,
respondent
says,
it
concedes
in
fact,
that
if
the
4
(e)
finding
is
not
necessary,
the
4
(e)
did
not
apply,
then,
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
is
binding.
you'll
find
that
i
think
on
page
84.
court
of
appeals
--
there's
a
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
court
that
is
binding.
you'll
also
find
on
any
one
of
these
briefs
that
he
said
he
didn't
have
any
other
remedy,
when
he's
brought
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
now,
we
agree
with
them
that
--
that
he
was
--
that
--
we
agree
with
him
on
that
but
for
different
reasons.
now,
they
didn't
have
any
other
remedy.
certainly,
the
court
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action
had
jurisdiction
had
jurisdiction
or
they
had
jurisdiction
certainly
if
the
judgment
should
be
honored
by
a
sister
court.
it
should
be
binding
on
the
sister
court
in
another
type
of
procedure.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
myes
but
that
--
that
goes
into
the
following
different
--
efforts
to
be
made,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
now,
that's
what
--
what
we
did
that
ties
him
with
that.
and
in
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
the
answer
sir,
and
remember,
the
power
authority
is
a
very
small
organization
we're
--
we're
really
on
their
own.
we're
not
the
state
although
we're
identified
very
much
with
the
state
and
are
a
creature
of
the
state.
but
--
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
yes,
the
answer
sir
is
that
we
couldn't
agree.
we'd
respond
to
counsel
on
the
type
of
legislation.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
time
element
for
building
the
project
was
cut,
that
a
licensee
could
get
a
uncontroversial
--
a
non-controversial
(inaudible),
it
wouldn't
do
any
good.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
that's
right.
i
spent
three
years
of
my
life
--
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
i
spent
three
and
a
half
years
of
my
life
getting
this
bill
through.
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
and,
but
anyway,
we
couldn't
agree
on
the
bill
and
new
york
state
had
a
great,
great
interest
in
it
because
of
a
--
mr.
thomas
f.
moore,
jr.
there's
a
difference
from
ours
but
we
--
which
we'd
oppose.
