mr.
freedman,
i'm
--
i'm
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i'm
afraid
i
may
not
have
completely
followed
you
in
your
last
point.
do
you
mean
the
--
the
overall
job
being
done
or
the
specific
job
being
done
by
this
--
by
this
injured
man
was
work
traditionally
done
by
seamen.
justice
potter

that
is
getting
a
ship
--
making
a
ship
seaworthy
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
it'd
been
in
overhauls?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
what
you
told
us
a
matter
of
evidence
in
this
case
or
something
of
which
we're
supposed
to
take
judicial
notice
or
for
everyone.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
had
in
mind
mr.
freedman
that
was
causing
me
difficulty
is
this.
that's
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
conceive
something
so
new,
a
technique
so
new
as
the
technique
of
mothballing
a
vessel
which
is
a
post-world
war
ii
technique
as
i
understand
it.
to
think
of
de-mothballing
a
vessel
is
something
that
is
so
traditionally
a
function
of
the
crew
of
the
vessel
and
there're
no
traditions
about
it.
it's
a
brand
new
technique.
justice
potter
stewart
de-mothballing
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
de-mothballing.
justice
potter
stewart
make
it
seaworthy.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

any
evidence
you
might
consider?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
or
that
this
work
is
--
is
a
seaman's
work.
justice
potter
stewart
just
--
i
wonder
if
you
can
answer
the
question
first?
justice
potter
stewart
no
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
court
opinions
are
there
involving
this
mothballing,
de-mothballing
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
this
one,
there
is
this
one
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
it
was
not
regarded
by
the
courts
as
involving
seaman's
work,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
how
much
--
is
there
any
--
what
evidence
is
there
that
a
vessel's
annual
overhaul
is
the
work
of
seaman
rather
than
of
a
shipyard?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
i've
--
if
you're
asking
me
to
decide
this
case
on
my
knowledge,
my
knowledge
is
contrary
to
that
based
on
four
and
a
half
years
experience
as
a
--
a
seaman.
but
(voice

--
i'm
wondering
what
evidence
there
is.
justice
potter
stewart
naval
reserve.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
thought
we
would
like
to
hear
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
being
accused
of
having
had
me
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
your
point
and
i
don't
want
to
interfere
with
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
freedman,
isn't
your
difficulty
of
that
argument
the
fact
that
this
court
has
reached
that
question
and
reasonable
and
philosophically
right
as
judge
hand
may
have
been,
he
was
overruled
in
that
case,
wasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
--
on
which
point?
and
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
halecki
case?
justice
potter
stewart
halecki
was
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
halecki
and
the
other
one
decided
the
same
day
in
the
second
circuit
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
