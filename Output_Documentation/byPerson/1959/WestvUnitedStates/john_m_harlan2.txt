come
to
a
conclusion
that
the
ship
was
in
navigation
or
that
the
rule
was
broad
enough
to
make
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
applicable.
you
don't
concede,
do
you
that
this
condition
was
an
unseaworthy
condition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
wondering
why
you
have
to
argue
on
this
broad
basis
rather
than
the
narrow
basis.
justice
john
m.
harlan
still,
you
could
prevail
--
you
could
prevail
in
this
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
case
on
the
narrow
ground,
couldn't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
it's
the
natural
question
of
a
lawyer
wanting
to
get
the
broadest
route.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
have
been
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
your
--
on
your
broader
argument?
would
from
your
point
of
view,
the
ship
has
been
in
navigation
after
she
was
released
from
her
dry
dock
for
these
major
--
for
these
repairs,
but
before
she
had
gotten
back
to
her
home
port
and
commenced
a
voyage
or
had
any
voyage
in
prospect,
would
she
be
in
navigation
or
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
broader
rule
doesn't
serve
the
element
of
a
case
by
case
--
it
doesn't
get
around
the
case
by
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
problem,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
contention
to
your
suggestion.
