if
you
--
if
you
think
of
relying
on
the
case
of
novo,
there
could
really
ignorant
men
other
like
me,
you
must
apply
some
materials
where
i
can
find
your
--
that
which
i'm
supposed
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
approved
my
point,
had
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
denying
any
of
what
you
say.
what
i'm
saying
is,
you'd
have
to
inform
my
mind.
i
may
admit
that
i
can
take
in
what
you
tell
me
but
--
but
trust
me,
i
am
quite
empty
on
this
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
take
your
time,
i
just
--
i
--
i
--
if
it's
on
your
brief,
i'll
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unlike
--
unlike
my
brother
stewart,
i'm
not
spoiled
by
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
couldn't
have
been
affirmed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short
--
in
short
if
she
had
been,
from
your
point
of
view
in
navigation
or
out
at
sea,
the
precarious
condition
of
the
pipes
would
not
--
would
have
rendered
her
unseaworthy.
justice
felix

so,
one
really
doesn't
get
very
far
in
getting
special
meaning
to
what
is
fit
for
a
situation
which
fundamentally,
according
to
your
view,
isn't
the
navigation.
justice

mr.
colby,
the
--
all
this
talk
about
implied
warranty
holding
out
the
so-called
--
that
is
legal
reasoning,
relevant
legal
reasoning
derived
from
a
still
broader
consideration,
namely
the
relation
of
the
ship
to
the
cargo
and
the
passengers
and
the
crew.
and
the
kind
of
relation
to
be
imposed,
the
kind
of
duties
to
be
imposed
by
law,
whether
they
like
it
or
not,
whether
the
shipowner
likes
it
or
not,
these
are
duties
imposed
by
law
in
view
of
the
relationship,
the
economic
relationship,
the
social
relationship,
the
bearing
in
other
words
that
a
--
that
a
shipper
and
the
passenger
and
the
seaman
has
that
those
are
the
seaman's
duties,
whatever
they
may
be,
occupy
the
functions
of
seamen.
the
relationship
they
have,
the
freedom
they
enjoy,
the
self
protection
as
against
the
economic
coercive
element
or
social
coercive
element
in
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
essence
of
the
matters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
to
go
beyond
merely
analyzing
analytically
what
an
implied
warranty
is
as
we
lawyers
find
it
to
the
underlying
source
of
economic
elements
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
out
of
which
this
imposed
duty
derives.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
cases,
--
well,
those
cases
are
different.
those
cases
involve
the
question,
â€œwho
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
doctrine?
who's
kind
of
related
within
its
benefits
for
the
obligation
as
part
of
the
shipowner,
not
whether
the
area
within
which
the
doctrine
operates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wasn't
that
--
wasn't
that
talbot
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
do
that.
those
are
the
people
who
are
--
go
to
--
this
duty
as
a
seaman
is
always
what
contends
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
onboard
--
or
the
question
--
there
wasn't
any
question
that
it
was
a
--
whether
it
was
a
--
the
ship
was
in
action
or
non-action,
wasn't
it?
this
definitely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
question
was
whether
you
could
distribute,
whether
you
could
unroll
your
responsibility
and
chuckle
it
all
around
the
contractor,
again
do
we
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
first
got
to
resolve
the
duty
in
order
to
find
out
whether
it's
delegable
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
opportunity
is
still
open
for
my
--
whether
we
would
disagree
on
your
present
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
my
brother
stewart
to
that
extent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he'll
have
to
decide
for
himself
whether
