mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
two
basic
issues
in
--
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
attaches
so
an
injured
maritime
worker
working
on
a
vessel
which
is
being
prepared
for
sea.
there
are
some
facets
to
that,
but
that
basically
is
the
first
issue
which
relates
to
the
maritime
--
with
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
the
second
issue
relates
to
negligence
and
it's
whether
or
not
the
shipowner,
when
he
lets
out
his
barge
or
his
vessel
for
repairs
or
for
any
overhauling,
anything
of
that
sort
whether
he
is
under
a
duty
under
his
nondelegable
duty
to
see
that
the
work
is
carried
on
safely
or
if
he
leaves
it
to
the
contractor
whether
under
that
same
nondelegable
duty,
he
is
responsible
for
the
negligence
of
the
contractor,
so
that
we
have
in
this
case
the
two
issues;
one,
based
on
the
warranty
and
the
other
in
terms
of
negligence.
coupled
with
either
or
both
of
these
theories,
there
is
the
duty
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work
and
we
say
that
it
is
embraced
primarily
in
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
although
it
is
also
a
part
of
the
duty
with
respect
to
negligence
also.
i
will
touch
on
those
as
we
come
to
them,
sir.
briefly,
the
important
facts
in
the
case
are
these.
the
government
had
a
vessel
called
the
mary
austin
laid
up
in
what
they
called
a
“moth-ball
fleet”
in
norfolk,
virginia.
in
1951,
the
government
decided
to
take
the
vessel
out
of
the
laid-up
status,
and
to
prepare
it
for
sea.
those
were
the
words
in
the
contract.
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
the
vessel
was
to
be
prepared
for
sea.
and
it
drew
up
a
series
of
specifications
which
are
of
importance
in
determining
the
nature
of
the
work
which
is
to
be
done
because
that
basically
determines
the
duties
which
are
to
be
attached
here.
the
work
involved
not
in
any
respect
any
major
structural
repairs.
indeed,
they
involved
no
structural
repairs
whatever.
they
involved
overhauling
of
the
vessel,
cleaning,
and
maintenance
cleaning
out
the
pipes
and
so
on
which
had
been
drained
of
water
during
this
period
of
lay-up.
this
vessel,
the
mary
austin
was
taken
from
its
laid-up
status
in
norfolk,
taken
out
and
then
towed
or
i
should
say
navigated.
it's
just
as
much
navigated
when
it's
towed
as
a
dead
vessel
as
it
is
when
it's
--
when
it
proceeds
under
its
power
over
the
high
seas.
it
was
navigated
under
tow
from
norfolk,
virginia
out
the
chesapeake
bay,
then
along
the
east
coast
and
up
the
delaware
bay
into
philadelphia
where
it
was
moored
to
a
pier.
there
were
two
or
three
piers
where
it
was
shipped
but
it
went
to
another
but
that's
not
--
it's
not
important
that
we
demonstrate
that
at
this
point
because
we
have
already
demonstrated,
she
was
in
navigation.
she
was
towed
all
the
way
up
from
norfolk
and
then
put
at
this
pier
for
these
repairs.
the
repairs
were
extensive
only
in
the
sense
that
they
involved
a
great
deal
of
the
same
type
of
repairs.
there
was,
i
think
$142,000
bid
for
the
contract.
that
was
the
contractor,
bid
that
and
got
the
contract.
however,
as
your
honors
will
see
from
a
--
an
examination
of
the
contract
itself
which
is
in
evidence
that
there
was
not
--
that
were
not
in
any
respect
any
structural
repairs
as
i
--
and
as
i
said
let
alone
major
structural
repairs
which
is
an
important
aspect
of
this
case.
now,
the
vessel
was
manned
from
the
time
she
left
norfolk
with
a
crew
of
six
men,
a
captain,
two
mates,
two
engineers,
and
a
steward
who
apparently
did
the
cooking
for
the
others.
these
men
stayed
whether
they
stood
watch
onboard
the
ship.
they
did
everything
else
that
was
necessary
onboard
this
vessel.
during
the
trip,
the
logbook
shows
all
of
that.
and
then
when
it
came
to
philadelphia,
and
the
contractor
sent
his
men
aboard
to
start
doing
the
work,
these
same
men
undertook
to
inspect
and
check
and
finally
approve
the
work
as
it
went
along.
i
--
i
think
it's
important
that
these
six
men
did
that
because
everyone
of
these
six
men
was
a
merchant
mariner,
a
seaman,
a
seaman
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
and
if
these
seamen
were
the
men
assigned
to
check
and
inspect
and
observe
this
work
as
it
went
along,
then
it's
perfectly
clear,
at
least
this
seemed
so
to
me,
that
it
was
work
within
their
can.
it
was
work
they
knew
themselves,
it
was
work
that
they
did
themselves
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
is
replete,
i
think
the
record
clearly
sustains
the
proposition
that
this
type
of
work
was
normally
and
traditionally
done
by
seamen
since
time
immemorial.
west
himself
was
injured
while
working,
west
was
a
marine
engineer,
i
should
say
too,
and
there
were
two
marine
engineers
--
merchant
seamen
on
this
vessel.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
overall
job,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
seaworthy,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
preparing
the
vessel
for
sea,
overhauling
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
no
dearth
of
authority
on
that
point.
chief
judge
parker,
the
late
chief
judge
parker
in
united
states
versus
lindgren,
in
a
decision
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court,
although
the
--
the
particular
point
was
not
under
--
under
consideration
of
this
court,
held
that
this
type
of
repair,
overhauling
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
repairs,
if
i
recall
correctly
were
even
more
extensive,
repairs
more
extensive
to
the
structure
of
the
vessel
than
they
were
in
this
case,
but
in
any
event,
the
court
there
held
that
such
repairs
were
seamen's
work,
and
lindgren
who
was
employed
in
that
case
was
held
to
be
a
seaman,
as
a
matter
fact,
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
as
to
what
a
seaman's
work,
your
honor?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
pretty
much
impossible
to
get
all
of
the
evidence
to
show
what
is
and
what
is
not
seaman's
work.
i
think
that
when
your
honors
wander
through
the
cases,
and
you
see
what
is
--
what
has
been
held
to
be
seaman's
work,
carpenter's
work,
a
complete
overhauling
of
the
vessel,
then
a
vessel
is
divided
into
three
parts
so
to
speak.
first,
we
have
what
we
call
the
deck
crew,
then
the
engine
room
crew
and
finally,
the
steward's
department.
the
deck
crew
takes
care
of
everything
outside
of
the
engine
room.
they
maintain
it.
you
have
licensed
officers
who
are
required
under
coast
guard
regulations
to
know
how
to
operate
a
vessel,
how
to
take
care
of
a
vessel.
we
have
the
manuals,
normal
manuals
which
are
available
to
your
honors
put
out
by
the
coast
guard
and
also
by
others,
private
text
writers
in
which
they
show
how
to
maintain
the
various
parts
of
the
vessel,
the
winches,
and
the
booms
and
the
masts
and
the
tackle
and
then
everything
else.
these
are
all
matters
which
necessarily
have
to
be
done
by
the
members
of
the
crew.
if
the
vessel
encounters
a
hurricane
at
sea
for
example
and
she
suffers
some
damage,
it
is
the
crew
which
repairs
it.
if
we
go
way
back,
if
we
--
we
might
even
note
in
the
laws
of
oleron
and
the
laws
of
wispy
and
so
on,
we
see
provision
made
under
circumstances
where
a
man,
even
when
we
get
back
to
the
pirate
days,
there's
even
provision
made
for
some
remedies
where
the
vessels
are
invaded
by
pirates
and
damage
inflicted.
now,
what
likewise
were
the
damage
is
inflicted
by
storms,
hurricanes
or
any
of
the
other
elements,
then
it
is
the
members
of
the
crew
who
necessarily
have
to
make
the
repairs.
they
not
only
clean
the
vessel.
the
deck
at
--
the
deck
crew
not
only
has
to
know
everything
about
it
but
they
do
take
care
of,
maintain
and
even
repair,
even
structural
repairs
where
a
vessel
suffers
damage
at
sea
because
of
--
of
heavy
hurricane.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
this
--
this
was
not
mothballing
the
vessel.
this
is
was
taking
it
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
out
of
mothballs.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
just
as
preparing
it
for
sea.
and
whether
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
the
methods
have
changed
--
methods
of
laying
a
ship
up,
but
laying
a
ship
up
is
nothing
new
your
honor.
it's
been
going
on
now
ever
since
shipping
was
known.
there
are
certain
seasons
particularly
in
some
areas
where
vessels
are
laid
up
for
the
season.
in
other
areas,
vessels
are
laid
up
either
for
lack
of
business
or
for
other
reasons
necessary
--
sufficient
on
to
the
owners.
they
lay
them
up.
sometimes,
they
lay
them
up
for
a
few
months
and
sometimes
for
years.
now,
when
they
lay
them
up,
they
use
all
of
the
preservatives
that
are
known
then
at
that
time
in
order
to
preserve
the
equipment,
to
preserve
the
machinery,
the
deck
machinery
and
the
engine
room
machinery
and
so
on
in
order
that
it
shouldn't
rust
and
in
order
that
no
more
damage
than
is
absolutely
necessary
should
occur.
now,
when
that
vessel
is
taken
out
of
laid-up
status,
and
as
i
said,
your
honor,
one
of
the
best
examples
that
i
can
cite
is
the
lindgren
case
which
was
decided
by
chief
judge
parker.
there,
when
it's
taken
out
and
there
--
and
that's
not
alone,
there
are
legions
of
cases
which
say
the
same
thing,
when
it's
taken
out
and
it's
got
to
be
to
be
overhauled,
this
is
seaman's
work
and
it's
always
been
seaman's
work.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
in
this
record?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that
--
that
it's
overhauling
work,
your
honor?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
there
is
no
work
in
any
contract
is
characterized
as
such,
as
seaman's
work,
your
honor.
we
only
have
to
reach
--
that's
a
conclusion
which
we
have
to
draw
from
the
facts
which
are
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
record
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
which
--
which
says
that
it
is
or
is
not
seaman's
work
that
is
using
that
tag
of
using
the
term
itself.
there
is
however,
ample
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
the
work
itself
has
always
been
regarded
by
the
courts
as
being
seaman's
work
but
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor
when
you
--
when
you
say
de-mothballing,
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
think
your
honor,
it
would
be
fair
to
state
that
every
vessel
which
is
laid-up,
is
really
put
in
mothballs.
the
technique
which
is
used,
the
preservatives
which
are
used
may
vary,
they
may
not,
but
they
may
vary.
but
the
term
mothballing
a
vessel
here,
your
honor,
is
a
label
which
was
put
on
it
by
someone
somewhere
along
the
line.
you
won't
find
it
in
the
contract.
it
was
just
a
laid-up
status.
somebody
--
someone
gave
it
that
name.
someone
gave
it
that
label.
but
that
was
a
label
which
was
given
to
it
for
want
of
a
better
expression.
but
the
real,
the
--
the
legal
terminology
which
would
apply
to
it
would
be
laid-up
status.
now,
as
i
said,
as
--
as
science
develops,
science
figures
out
perhaps
some
better
preservatives
to
maintain
the
various
different
pieces
of
apparatus.
it's
no
more
mothballing
a
vessel
if
you
used
a
more
scientific
method
of
--
of
preserving
the
structure
and
its
various
pieces
of
equipment.
and
i
--
it
just
seems
to
me,
sir
that
mothballing
the
vessel
is
simply
a
term
which
someone
in
this
case
applied
to
it
and
it's
a
term
which
some
lawyer
applied
to
it
but
it's
not
a
term
which
was
applied
to
it
by
the
government
itself
in
the
--
in
the
letting
of
the
contract.
i
read
through
this
contract
and
i
don't
recall
seeing
the
term
mentioned
even
once
in
the
contract.
it
just
says
it's
laid-up
and
i
think
that
your
honor
will
find
pretty
much
the
same
type
of
language
in
this
contract
in
referring
to
the
vessel
here
as
your
honor
will
find
in
any
other
case
where
a
vessel
has
been
laid
up
and
then
was
taken
over
for
overhaul.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honors,
we'll
go
through
the
--
again,
that's
a
conclusion
which
i
think
your
honors
must
consider
judicially.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
--
i
venture,
your
honor
that
--
your
honor
was
in
the
navy.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
naval
reserve.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
there's
a
big
difference
your
honor
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
i
assume
that
your
honor
was
in
military
service.
there's
a
--
there's
a
big
difference
between
the
techniques
and
the
services
which
are
done
by
men
in
the
military
service
than
what
is
done
in
the
merchant
marine
generally.
now,
if
your
honor
was
involved
in
a
laying-up
--
in
the
laying-up
of
a
destroyer
or
something
of
that
sort,
your
honor
probably
saw
these
preservatives
applied
and
perhaps
in
some
instances,
they
put
this
rubberized
material
over
some
of
it.
but
i
submit
to
your
honor
whether
it's
the
rubberized
material
or
whether
that's
some
other
form
of
preservative
in
the
pipes,
it
doesn't
matter
so
long
as
it's
laid-up.
and
then
the
problem
becomes
--
you
see
your
honor
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well
i
--
i
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
prefer
to
reach
any
question
in
your
honor's
mind.
my
brief
has
my
argument
in
it
and
i
--
i
would
much
prefer
your
honor
do
interrogate
me
on
these
points,
i
would
like
to
reach
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
having
heard
some
of
your
honors'
opinions
in
maritime
cases,
i
think
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
no,
your
honor.[laughter]
well,
your
honor
has
demonstrated
quite
a
tremendous
wealth
of
knowledge
in
the
opinions
that
i've
read
regarding
the
activities
in
the
--
merchant
marine
field
and
your
honor,
will
say
we
go
back
to
pope
&
talbot
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
sir,
let
me
go
back
on
that
point
then.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
alright,
sirs.
as
i've
said,
i
would
prefer
to
reach
the
questions
which
may
occur
to
the
court
now
because
it's
all
in
my
brief.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
[attempt
to
laughter]
well,
sir,
let's
take
the
pope
&
talbot
case
versus
hawn
which
this
court
decided
after
sieracki.
there
was
a
case
involving
a
ship's
carpenter.
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
the
work
on
a
vessel
involving
a
repair,
and
this
was
to
some
extent
a
structural
repair,
a
repair
to
a
grain
feeder
which
permitted
the
grain
to
flow
down
through
chutes
into
the
various
holds.
hawn
on
that
case
was
a
carpenter,
a
repairman.
now,
prior
to
that
time,
i
don't
know
that
this
court
had
ever
passed
specifically
on
the
point
that
whether
a
carpenter
engaged
in
a
grain
feeder's
work
was
seaman's
work.
actually,
your
honors,
the
point
is
there
are
two
factors
which
have
to
come
together
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
is
seaman's
work
and
whether
or
not
it's
covered
by
the
warranty
which
is
after
all
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
number
one
is
it
afloat
to
navigable
waters
so
that
if
a
tort
occurs,
we
have
a
maritime
tort.
number
two,
is
it
the
kind
of
work
which
is
an
aid
of
navigation.
now,
on
this
point,
i
would
like
to
make
this
distinction.
when
we
talk
about
navigation,
i
think
the
court
below
went
wrong
here
and
distinguished
--
and
failing
to
distinguish
what
--
what
may
be
known
as
active
navigation
from
a
vessel
on
idle
status.
of
course
both
vessels
are
in
navigation,
one
is
inactive,
but
the
fact
that
the
other
one
is
on
idle
status
doesn't
make
it
any
the
less
in
navigation,
it
is
nevertheless
in
navigation.
now,
if
the
work
which
is
done
is
in
a
--
is
to
put
her
back
into
commerce
is
to
prepare
for
sea,
this
--
this
court
has
said
in
--
in
virtually
all
of
the
cases
on
the
subject
and
as
i
said
in
the
lindgren
case,
it
made
it
clear,
even
in
the
third
circuit,
other
panels
in
the
third
circuit
have
made
it
clear.
if
it's
designed
to
either
maintain
the
vessel
in
commerce
or
if
it's
designed
to
put
it
into
commerce
if
it's
been
laid-up,
it
is
in
aid
of
navigation.
now,
the
only
other
thing
that
we've
got
to
determine
at
that
point
is
whether
the
services
which
this
particular
man
is
involved
in,
is
the
type
of
traditional
seaman
service
which
brings
with
it,
which
carries
with
it
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
judge
hand
on
that
point
made
the
distinction
in
the
halecki
case
which
came
before
this
court
recently
and
he
said
that
all
of
these
services
short
of
a
complete
reconstruction
of
the
vessel
itself,
a
rebuilding
of
the
vessel
itself,
all
of
these
services
are
effectively
or
may
be
termed
seaman's
services.
they
are
in
the
aid
of
navigation.
they
are
designed
to
put
the
vessel
back
in
navigation
or
in
active
navigation.
the
fact
that
the
vessel
is
afloat
brings
it
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
so
we
get
them
outside
of
the
tort
if
there
is
one
there
and
secondly,
if
the
services
short
of
the
major
structural
repairs
which
involve
a
complete
reconstruction.
for
example,
in
the
berge
case,
berge
versus
united
states,
judge
hand
there
and
speaking
for
the
second
circuit
had
this
situation.
he
said
that
here
we
had
a
complete
tearing
out
of
the
entire
interior
of
the
vessel,
complete
tearing
out.
it
was
a
vessel
that
was
going
to
be
transformed,
converted
into
some
other
service.
and
there
was
then
a
complete
rebuilding
of
bulk
heads,
decks
and
everything.
it
was
a
complete
rebuilding
job.
judge
hand
there
said
that
the
seaman
services
terminate
somewhere
along
the
line.
and
when
we
have
a
complete
reconstruction,
that's
the
word
to
be
used
or
a
complete
--
a
virtually,
a
complete
rebuilding
of
the
vessel
then
at
that
point,
judge
hand
drew
the
line
and
said
he
couldn't
recognize
that
as
seaman's
services.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
need
reach
that
question
at
this
point,
whether
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that
on
this
point.
oh,
no.
your
honors
affirmed
him
on
that
point.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
on
the
point
--
on
the
point
of
the
services,
the
seaman
services.
he
was
not
overruled
on
that
point.
so
far
as
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
point
in
the
halecki
and
also
the
skovgaard.
the
--
the
only
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
right,
sir.
skovgaard,
the
two
of
them
were
companion
cases
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
in
a
sense.
the
--
the
--
in
the
halecki
case,
your
honors
didn't
touch
that
part
of
judge
hand's
opinion
which
i've
just
quoted.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
your
honors
only
--
only
reversed
part
of
it.
well,
there
were
--
there
were
other
cases
too.
we
have
--
we
have
the
--
we
have
the
berge
case,
we
have
the
halecki
case,
we
have
the
gerini
case
where
judge
hand
said
that
--
that
were
never
reached
your
honors.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
on
the
interpretation
of
the
death
act,
your
honor.
i
think
in
halecki,
i
think
your
honor
held,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
in
any
case
of
maritime
tort
even
though
the
--
you
may
follow
the
state
statute
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
thought
your
honor
was
referring
to
halecki.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
it's
--
well
halecki
and
--
halecki
and
tungus
so
far
as
the
state
death
act
involved
pretty
much
the
same
principle
that
is
under
the
death
act.
your
honors
there
held
--
your
honor,
justice
brennan
–
mr.
justice
brennan,
filed
a
dissent
on
a
ground
that
when
you
--
even
when
you
seek
the
remedy
under
a
state
death
act,
the
substantive
law
in
determining
the
liability
of
the
parties
must
be
drawn
from
the
maritime
law,
whereas,
mr.
justice
stewart
in
that
case
held
that
when
you
take
the
remedy
out
the
state
statute,
out
the
state
court,
you
take
the
substantive
law
of
a
state
which
was
limited.
in
other
words,
under
the
law
of
the
state,
normally,
there's
a
question.
there's
no
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
your
honor
held
that
in
testing
the
liability
--
the
--
your
honor
distinguished
between
the
right
and
the
remedy.
the
remedy
would
be
under
the
state
death
act
whereas
the
right
involved
the
substantive
rights
of
the
parties
and
that
the
--
and
the
determination
of
that
right
had
to
be
drawn
from
the
maritime
law
itself.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
on
that
point,
your
honors,
your
honors
(voice
overlap)
specifically
reserved.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
your
honors,
i
think
the
--
the
majority
specifically
reserved
the
question
that
we
have
right
here
in
halecki,
namely
--
namely
whether
or
not
in
this
situation
where
there
is
a
--
a
service
involving
the
repair
or
placing
a
vessel
back
in
operation,
your
honors
specifically
in
that
case
--
that
is
the
majority
specifically
in
that
in
case,
i
think
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
in
your
dissenting
opinion
that
--
that
it
covered
just
citing
pope
&
talbot
that
it
did
cover,
but
i
think
that
the
majority
did
reserve
that
point
in
the
halecki
case.
i
think
i
had
reached
the
point
and
stating
that
the
vessel
was
manned
by
a
crew
of
five.
i
would
like
to
make
this
observation
--
or
six
rather.
that
actually
while
we
make
the
point
here
and
while
it
demonstrates
that
actually,
there
was,
the
vessel
was
manned,
i
do
not
believe
it
makes
any
difference.
in
fact,
i'm
--
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
cases
indicate
this
would
be
an
honor
--
an
--
an
answer
to
your
honor,
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
in
the
preceding
argument
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
refer
to
it
while
your
honor
was
on
this
point
and
i
think
that
whether
a
vessel
is
manned,
actually
doesn't
matter.
this
court
in
warner
versus
norton,
321
u.s.,
involving
a
barge,
a
dead
barge
as
--
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here,
when
we
say
dead
barge,
we
really
mean
it,
a
--
a
vessel
without
any
motor
power
of
its
own
and
--
and
this,
the
mary
austin
was
pretty
much
the
same.
so
long
as
the
men
who
are
working
on
it,
if
they
are
performing
these
maritime
services
in
aid
of
it,
then
they
take
the
place
of
the
men
who
normally
would
be
her
crew
for
this
purpose
and
therefore,
actually
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
if
the
vessel
itself
was
or
was
not
manned
by
a
regular
crew,
(inaudible)
is
entirely
irrelevant
or
--
and
--
and
even
unimportant.
the
point
is
that
if
the
vessel
itself
is
in
navigable
waters,
if
the
service
being
performed
is
a
maritime
service,
in
aid
of
navigation,
then
i
think
the
cases
pretty
clearly
hold
that
the
warranty
applies.
in
this
situation,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
perhaps
this
might
be
relevant
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question
before.
in
determining
the
question
of
laid-up
status,
whether
the
nature
of
the
service
themselves,
judge
hand,
speaking
for
the
court
in
the
berge
case
and
--
and
several
other
cases,
the
gerini
case
and
i
think
another
one
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
pointed
out
after
he
reviewed
the
cases,
but
where
the
vessel
is
being
laid
up,
the
services
which
are
being
performed
to
lay
it
up,
may
not
be
maritime
services,
may
not
be
the
kind
of
services
which
are
designed
in
aid
of
navigation.
these
are
the
cases
which
were
cited
by
my
friend
in
his
brief
which
involved
jones
act
cases
which
are
not
the
issue
here.
here,
we
do
not
have
any
jones
act
case
because
we're
not
suing
the
employer
and
that's
a
--
an
important
distinction.
i
would
to
reserve
--
i've
lost
track
of
my
time
but
i
would
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
would
like
to
make
this
point
which
i
think
is
in
further
answer
to
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
before
and
i
think
rounds
it
up.
if
the
services
are
supported
in
laid-up
status
or
whatever
we
want
to
call
it,
whether
it's
in
mothballs
or
anything
else,
then
it's
to
take
it
out
of
act
of
navigation
and
some
courts
have
held
that
that
service
is
not
a
maritime
service.
that
service
is
in
not
in
furtherance
of
navigation
and
therefore
that
service
is
not
traditionally
seaman's
service.
however,
up
to
that
point
when
we
get
to
the
opposite
extreme,
anything
which
is
done
to
maintain
it
in
the
service,
in
the
--
in
navigation
or
to
put
it
into
navigation
is
exactly
the
opposite
and
every
single
one
of
the
cases
which
my
friends
cite
in
their
brief
here
say
exactly
that,
everyone
of
them.
like
the
antus
case,
where
there
was
a
question
of
laying
it
up.
we
had
the
--
the
horn
case
where
the
vessel
was
being
laid
up
for
--
to
be
used
as
a
storage
for
soya
beans,
the
court
there
held
that
wasn't
any
maritime
service.
i
see
that
i
have
five
minutes
left.
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
for
rebuttal,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
like
to
briefly
reply
to
some
of
the
points
which
my
friend
--
let
me
address
myself
first
to
this
question
about
seaworthiness.
it's
so
--
as
your
honor,
justice
frankfurter
has
stated,
it's
a
--
it's
a
duty
imposed
by
law.
it's
not
contractual
in
a
sense
that
the
parties
say
i
contract,
i
warrant
that
it's
seaworthy
or
not
seaworthy
whatever
it
may
be.
the
law
imposes
it
on
them,
and
the
duty
is
on
the
shipowner
to
make
sure
or
to
provide,
not
to
make
sure
but
to
provide
a
safe
and
seaworthy
vessel.
and
if
in
fact
it's
not
safe,
this
court
said
in
sieracki
at
so
many
times
that
the
shipowner
is
liable.
in
some
sense
in
--
in
some
of
the
cases,
they
called
it
a
warranty,
in
some
other
cases
this
court
has
called
it
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness.
now,
i
may
say
now,
i've
only
already
got
a
couple
of
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
cover
some
of
the
points
that
is
made
here.
i
would
like
to
say
now
that
the
government
has
already
taken
a
very,
very
sharp
attack
away
from
the
argument
which
they
made
in
their
in
brief.
as
your
honors
will
read
they
briefs,
you'll
see
that
they
make
the
big
distinction
on
the
basis
of
major
home
port
structural
repairs,
if
i
may
quote
them.
that's
the
way
--
that's
way
that
your
honors
will
find
it
in
the
brief,
major
home
port
structural
repairs.
now,
they
come
along
and
they
say
that
makes
no
difference.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
point
is
that
that
is
the
difference.
that
does
make
the
issue
in
this
case.
i
said
before
in
--
in
answer
to
mr.
--
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
we
need
not
reach
the
point.
what
i
meant
was,
we
need
not
determine
whether
if
they
are
major
home
port
--
home
port
structural
repairs,
whether
the
warranty
applied
in
those
cases,
it
applies
--
what
i
meant
to
say
was
and
this
court
should
find
that
it
applies
at
least
to
that
point
as
mr.
judge
hand
has
said
as
this
court
has
said
in
both
in
talbot,
justice
hand
in
sieracki
and
the
other
cases
which
followed,
peterson.
and
i
may
say
too
that
the
--
i
disagree
very
strongly
with
my
friends
over
here
that
in
all
of
these
cases,
that
the
warranty
was
applied
only
in
contemplation
of
a
voyage.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
despite
the
contrary,
the
famous
rogers,
there
was
no
voyage
in
question.
in
the
case
of
famous
rogers,
there
was
no
voyage
in
contemplation.
they
--
this
court
found
an
unseaworthy
condition
and
they
overruled
--
they
overruled
this
third
circuit
to
concur.
now,
there
are
other
cases,
the
johansen
file
that
your
honor
said
(inaudible)
where
that
was
never
made
a
condition,
not
once
was
never
made
a
condition
that
it
must
be
part
in
with
the
voyage.
how
about
all
of
these
inland
water
vessels,
the
tugboats,
the
drudgers
that
never
go
to
sea,
they
never
make
any
sea
voyages.
these
too
had
been
held
to
be
mind
with
under
the
warranty,
the
so
called
warranty
to
seaworthiness.
but
whether
we
call
it
the
warranty
of
something
else,
the
point
is
it
is
a
liability
for
an
unsafe
condition
aboard
the
ship.
and
this
court
said
in
sieracki,
if
in
fact
in
some
statement,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
they
could
discover
or
whether
they
couldn't
discover,
there
is
an
absolute
liability
and
that's
--
that's
the
plaintiff's
argument.
there
was
one
other
point
too
that
i
started
to
make
in
this
case
which
i
might
probably
had
touched
on,
and
that
is
the
liability,
concerns
the
case
of
negligence
and
he
says,
we
gave
it
all
over
to
the
contract
and
this
is
what
they've
argued
in
the
brief.
in
other
words,
we
really
push
control
on
the
entire
vessel.
this
court
in
peterson
said
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
relinquishing
control
of
the
vessel.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
was
adopted
for
trial
by
this
court,
said,
that
where
the
shipowner
engages
a
private
contractor,
to
do
and
work
on
aboard
the
ship
he
doesn't
relinquish
control.
the
responsibility
of
this
regardless
of
who
engages
and
the
court
in
so
many
words
said
there
--
and
judge
hand
said
in
--
in
the
halecki
case
too,
that
the
--
and
rather
of
which
--
and
the
--
and
the
--
just
as
halecki
(inaudible)
reviewed
all
of
these
--
control
this
cases
related
to
control.
but
that
was
an
old
concept
emanating
out
of
the
second
circuit
and
only
out
of
the
second
circuit,
which
is
now
repudiated
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
peterson
and
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn
and
--
and
in
most
likely
in
crumady
versus
fisser.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it's
both,
your
honor,
peterson
versus
hawn
it
was
(voice

--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
your
honor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
--
(voice
overlap)
this
court
had
this
situation,
your
honor.
we
had
a
situation
of
a
private
contractor
not
merely
doing
the
wrong,
but
bringing
his
own
equipment
on
board
which
was
--
which
was
defective
and
this
court
held
that
under
the
control
theory,
they
couldn't
say
that
they
came
to
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
ship
was
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right.
in
other
words,
that
nondelegable
duty
is
such
your
honor,
that
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
that
duty
--
that
duty
was
made
clear
by
this
court
in
sieracki
and
the
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn,
most
recently
in
crumady
and
i
might
say
that
the
distinction
which
my
friend,
the
assignment
would
say,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
does
cover
the
point
that
friend
just
made.
the
--
the
distinction
there
was
only
on
the
one
point
as
to
what
the
application
of
the
state
statute
involved
as
to
the
question
of
what
a
seaworthiness
means.
mr.
justice
stewart
joined
with
the
majority
in
the
crumady
case
in
holding
quite
to
the
contrary.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
they
had
already
agreed
on
my
questions
in
the
--
in
the
crumady
case.
and
crumady,
your
honors
know
mr.
justice
stewart
joined
with
mr.
justice
brennan
on
the
majority.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
of
course.
