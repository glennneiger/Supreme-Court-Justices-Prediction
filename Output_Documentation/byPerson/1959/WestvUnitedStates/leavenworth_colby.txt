mr.
leavenworth
colby
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
first
to
direct
attention
to
a
bit
of
the
facts
here
and
ask
the
court
to
remember
that
as
my
brother
has
pointed
out,
here
we
have
a
vessel
which
has
been
for
many
years
in
what
i
believe
is
called
the
“moth-ball
fleet”
which
is
probably
all
the
mothballing
there
is
about
this.
she
had
then
been
brought
up
to
philadelphia
where
the
cheapest
bidder
on
the
reconditioning
contract
was
situated
in
order
that
she
might
be
put
in
shape
to
be
seaworthy
to
go
in
to
maritime
service
after
this
long
lay-up.
during
the
period
of
the
lay-up,
they
opened
up
all
of
her
piping,
take
all
of
the
little
plugs
and
things
out
of
the
piping,
drain
it,
blow
it
out,
fill
it
full
of
preservatives
and
put
these
plugs
and
things
back
with
just
a
turn
or
two
to
keep
the
preservative
in
warm
weather
from
flowing
out.
now,
thus,
the
plugs
and
whatnot
will
not
stay
in
place
under
any
pressure.
so
she
was
brought
up
and
she
entered
upon
her
period
of
reconditioning
which
the
district
court
said
was
the
equivalent
of
homeport
structural
repairs.
now,
i
don't
it
all,
what
the
district
court
meant
by
that
expression,
but
that's
what
it
said.
now,
what
took
place
was
that
she
was
in
repair
for
36
days.
the
libelant
here
was
injured
on
the
16th
day
and
20
more
days
more
of
repair
was
required
before
the
vessel
was
in
condition
to
be
seaworthy
for
a
voyage.
so
you
have
him
injured
right
in
the
middle
of
the
thing,
of
the
repair
period.
now,
when
injured,
mr.
west,
who
was
an
engineer
was
kneeling
down
on
his
right
knee,
with
his
left
knee
elevated
in
the
low
pressure
cylinder
of
the
engine.
so
you
will
please
note
that
the
repairs
were
sufficiently
major
that
they
had
her
engines
all
torn
apart
and
he
was
down
in
the
cylinder.
while
thus
kneeling,
one
of
these
plugs
hit
him
on
the
left
knee,
doing
the
injuries
for
which
this
suit
is
brought.
now,
the
record
shows
that
nobody
ever
did
figure
out
exactly
how
the
plug
dropped
and
hit
him
on
the
knee.
but
because
there
was
some
moisture
on
the
deck
or
rather
i
guess
on
the
--
in
the
cylinder
underneath
where
the
plug
dropped
and
because
it
was
known
that
employees
of
the
repair
contractor
had
put
a
pressure,
a
water
head
pressure
on
the
pipes,
it
was
thought
that
the
repair
contractor's
people
by
putting
this
pressure
on
the
pipes
had
blown
the
plug
which
was
only
one
thread
in
out
and
that
it
had
fallen
through
an
arc
in
space
and
clipped
mr.
west
on
the
knee,
doing
in
the
injuries
for
which
suit
is
brought.
now,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
as
to
the
seriousness
of
the
repairs
that
it
went
on
for
36
days
and
this
was
in
the
middle
of
thing
so
that
it
was
20
days
more
after
this
before
the
vessel
became
seaworthy
in
any
ordinary
and
real
sense
and
we
say
she
was
seaworthy
for
the
purpose.
that
is
to
say
she
was
in
the
shape
that
a
vessel
that
goes
in
to
be
repaired
is
in.
now,
the
specifications
were
rather
specific
that
this
was
the
job
that
had
to
be
done
on
this
piping,
so
that
the
government
had
disclosed
the
condition.
there
was
nothing
inherently
latent
about
this,
everybody
knew
about
it.
it
was
a
case
of
mr.
west
and
others
coming
aboard
to
take
care
of
these
things.
so
now,
that
is
the
situation
on
the
amount
of
repairs
and
their
character
so
far
as
the
record
discloses.
now,
the
district
court
said
that
she
did
not
have
a
crew
aboard.
by
that,
the
district
court
obviously
meant
she
didn't
have
a
crew
of
some
48
men
which
would
have
been
her
normal
complement.
there
were
aboard
some
people
who
i
believe
later
became
her
crew
to
take
her
to
sea
along
with
a
complete
complement
of
seamen,
who
were
not
on
the
government
payroll
but
were
on
the
personal
payroll,
if
you
will,
of
united
states
lines,
the
government's
husbanding
agent
to
see
to
the
supervision
of
the
repair.
they
were
as
my
brother
said,
six
in
number,
not
a
crew
of
48
but
six.
they
of
course
stood
watches
and
they
kept
logbooks
just
like
you
do
on
a
construction
or
repair
job
onshore,
where
also
the
people
stand
watches
and
keep
logbooks.
so
they
were
of
course
seamen,
because
only
seamen
have
the
proper
people
to
see
whether
a
repair
contractor
is
doing
the
job
that
he's
paid
to
do
under
the
specifications
of
the
contract,
now
so
much
for
the
manning.
now
my
brother
has
suggested
that
the
crew
is
of
course
divided
into
three
departments,
the
deck,
the
engine
and
the
steward's.
well,
that's
true
in
this
kind
of
a
ship,
but
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
on
a
passenger
ship,
you
also
have
the
pursers
department
and
that
entertainers
including
singers
and
hair
dressers
and
all
such
people
are
of
course
seamen.
seaman
as
the
court
said
in
warner
and
norton,
which
my
friend
here
has
cited
to
you,
quoting
the
very
great
admiralty
judge,
judge
hough,
“are
people
who
do
anything
for
the
benefit
of
a
voyage,
not
necessarily
those
who
hand,
reef
and
steer.”
so
the
singer,
who
appears
with
the
band
is
also
doing
seaman's
work.
and
this
is
why
we
think
that
any
attempt
to
approach
the
analysis
of
this
problem
by
asking
whether
a
particular
thing
is
seaman's
work
or
not,
is
apt
to
be
a
little
empty.
in
other
words,
there
is
very
little
that
some
seaman
on
some
type
of
ship
doesn't
do.
all
passenger
ships
have
upholsterers
and
drapers
aboard
as
part
of
the
crew.
so
i
assume
that
upholstering
and
draping
is
obviously
seaman's
work
and
so
we
go.
so
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
attempt
to
decide
the
scope
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
by
the
nature
of
the
task
involved
is
one
that
gives
rise
to
very
great
difficulties.
in
the
halecki
case,
if
your
honors
will
recall,
great
difficulty
was
experienced
and
mr.
justice
brennan
in
a
very
knowing
opinion
said
that
he
couldn't
quite
see
the
distinction.
well
now,
like
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
have
the
same
difficulty
in
attempting
to
do
this
by
the
task
involved.
let
us,
however,
look
at
the
history
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
now,
after
all,
mr.
freedman's
client
is
trying
to
recover
here
for
breach
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
now,
this
is
an
implied
warranty.
now,
let
us
think
for
a
moment
in
the
abstract,
what
are
requirements
for
recovery
for
a
breach
of
warranty,
implied
warranty
of
any
sort.
first,
the
implied
warranty
must
not
be
negated
by
something
express
in
the
contract
or
implicit
in
the
circumstances.
second,
there
must
be
reasonable
reliance
such
as
a
prudent
person
would
have
upon
the
warranty
that
is
implied.
finally,
the
plaintiff
or
libelant
must
rely
upon
the
warranty
and
be
damaged
by
its
breach.
now,
let's
look
at
the
history
of
the
breach
--
of
the
implied
warranty
for
seaworthiness.
aside
from
cargo
and
passenger
cases,
it
takes
its
origin
in
the
case
of
osceola
where
the
court
said
there
was
an
implied
warranty
of
the
sea
--
of
seaworthiness
of
a
vessel
for
the
voyage.
and
that
it
made
no
difference
that
the
sea
that
the
--
the
defect
was
one
that
existed
without
the
fault
or
knowledge
of
the
shipowner.
now
your
honors
will
recall
that
osceola
was
a
case
of
the
ship
having
been
equipped
with
some
gear
for
putting
out
the
gangway
when
she
came
to
shore
and
this
was
found
to
be
stated
in
the
question
certified
to
be
entirely
seaworthy
and
proper.
the
difficulty
in
osceola
was
that
the
master
put
out
the
rigging
to
hold
the
gangway
while
she
was
out
where
the
wind
would
catch
her.
the
vessel
was
making
some
11
knots
and
there
was
an
8-knot
wind.
and
the
gangway
thrashed
around
and
hurt
the
man
who
was
injured
and
that
was
the
way
the
case
came
up.
so
now
you'll
notice
that
this
is
a
question
of
warranty
of
seaworthiness
for
a
voyage
which
is
in
actual
operation.
now,
that
is
the
first
time
that
we
have
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
implied
in
favor
of
a
seaman.
now
the
next
case,
if
your
honors
please,
was
mr.
justice
mcreynolds'
opinion
in
carlisle
packing
company
against
sandanger.
i'm
sure
we
all
remember
this
in
the
classical
way.
this
is
the
coal
oil
can
case
as
opposed
to
the
malice
case
or
something
like
that.
they
had
a
coal
oil
can,
marked
coal
oil
aboard
and
it
had
gasoline
in
it.
and
it
was
held
by
the
court
that
this
was
a
breach
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
because
a
coal
oil
can
was
warranted
to
have
coal
oil
in
it
and
not
gasoline
and
therefore,
mr.
sandanger
was
entitled
to
a
recovery.
now,
once
again
please
note
that
this
is
an
implied
warranty
of
seaworthiness
for
a
voyage.
this
happened
while
he
was
on
the
voyage.
we
come
next
--
oh
i
might
say
in
--
in
sandanger
that
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
emphasized
the
point
by
giving
as
his
authority
the
silvia
and
the
southwark.
now,
silvia
was
a
case
involving
whether
there
was
a
breach
of
the
warranty
of
the
seaworthiness
to
cargo
where
a
perfectly
proper
porthole
was
left
open.
and
that
it
was
held
there
was
no
breach
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
that
these
was
just
negligent
management
by
the
officers
and
crew
in
not
shutting
up
the
porthole
when
they
got
in
bad
weather.
southwark
was
a
somewhat
similar
type
of
situation
in
respect
to
refrigerator
machinery.
now,
this
again
is
the
development
of
the
concept
and
the
scope
and
what
have
you
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
of
a
vessel.
it
is
for
a
voyage.
the
next
case
in
this
court
of
importance
was
of
course
the
mahnich
case
this
is
the
wolf
case.
the
shipowner
put
aboard
unsound
line
and
sound
line.
and
he
didn't
cut
the
unsound
line
up
into
small
lengths
so
the
mate
took
some
of
the
old
defective
line
and
rigged
the
boatswain's
chair
or
something
of
the
sort
with
it,
held
that
their
having
of
the
line
aboard
in
such
lengths
that
it
might
be
used
for
a
boatswain's
chair
was
an
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel.
now,
once
again,
in
the
course
of
the
voyage,
the
implied
warranty
of
seaworthiness
for
the
voyage
is
just
same
as
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
which
is
made
to
the
shipper
of
cargo
and
to
the
passenger,
it
is
for
the
voyage.
now,
we
come
next
to
sieracki.
you
will
recall
that
in
loading
the
vessel,
a
shackle
broke,
held
that
even
though
the
man
was
not
a
seaman
in
the
literal
sense
and
was
not
subject
to
the
discipline
which
the
court
had
referred
to
in
mahnich
as
the
reason
why
you
have
the
same
kind
of
a
warranty
in
favor
of
a
seaman
as
in
favor
of
passengers
and
cargo
that
is
to
say
that
they
couldn't
look
into
the
thing.
the
shipper
and
the
--
the
passenger
have
no
chance,
the
seaman
by
reason
of
the
discipline
was
thought
in
mahnich
to
have
no
genuine
opportunity
to
do
so.
now,
we
come
to
sieracki
and
although
there
is
this
difference
and
although
there
is
no
privity
of
contract
between
the
shipowner
and
the
injured
repairman
--
the
injured
stevedore
employee,
still
by
analogy
to
macpherson
and
buick,
the
privity
of
contract
is
ignored
and
we
go
on.
but
still
again
all,
it
is
the
implication
of
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
for
the
voyage.
it
is
in
the
course
of
the
loading.
next
in
order
in
this
court
comes
pope
&
talbot
against
hawn.
now,
that
was
a
case
where
with
the
complete
crew
aboard,
the
vessel
was
almost
through
loading
to
go
out
--
the
grain
fittings
became
defective
in
some
particular
and
the
injured
man
who
was
a
carpenter
of
a
very
special
type,
the
kind
of
carpenters
who
see
to
looking
after
grain
fittings.
it's
a
type
of
stevedoring
work
but
at
the
same
time
it's
a
type
of
repair
work.
he
was
injured,
held
that
the
warranty
extended
to
him.
now,
that
seems
obvious.
the
vessel
was
loading
for
the
voyage.
the
shipowner
had
represented
that
she
was
seaworthy.
cargo
was
already
aboard.
certainly,
there
was
no
doubt
at
that
point
that
there
hadn't
been
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
every
pound
of
cargo
that
had
been
on
laden.
so
it's
held
that
the
warranty
extends
also
to
this
carpenter
who
comes
aboard.
nothing
is
more
natural,
but
notice
it's
in
the
course
of
the
voyage.
next
we
have
alaska
steamship
and
peterson.
this
is
again
loading
or
unloading
for
the
voyage.
the
stevedore
is
allowed
by
the
ship
to
bring
aboard
a
defective
snatch
block
instead
of
requiring
him
to
use
vessel's
snatch
block,
they
let
him
use
their
own.
this
was
defective,
peterson
was
injured,
but
it
is
once
more
a
breach
of
a
warranty
implied
of
seaworthiness
for
the
voyage.
now,
rogers
is
of
course
the
same.
now,
we
had
it
last
term,
again,
in
connection
with
skovgaard
and
the
tungus.
there
again,
the
injury
was
in
the
course
of
the
voyage.
they
were
off
loading
at
that
time.
now,
no
case
in
this
court
has
held
that
there
may
be
a
recovery
on
account
of
breach
of
an
implied
warranty
of
seaworthiness
not
for
a
voyage
but
at
some
other
time.
now
my
brother,
i
see
by
his
argument,
urges
that
this
court
say
that
there
is
an
implied
warranty
of
seaworthiness
from
the
moment
the
vessel
is
completed
building
until
she
is
done
and
finished
and
goes
to
the
grave
yard.
he
appears
to
make
an
exception
to
take
care
of
certain
cases
on
account
of
some
kind
of
major
structural
repairs.
well,
of
course
any
such
major
structural
repairs
are
obviously
not
in
the
course
of
a
voyage,
but
the
thing
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
should
address
itself
to
instead
of
looking
at
the
tasks
of
the
workmen,
to
look
at
what
is
the
representation
and
warranty
of
the
shipowner.
now
clearly,
in
the
case
of
mr.
west,
and
the
mary
austin
here,
there
was
no
representation
by
the
shipowner
that
the
vessel
was
seaworthy
for
a
voyage.
in
fact,
the
whole
thing
was,
she
was
unseaworthy
except
to
the
extent
that
they
were
able
to
tow
her
up
from
the
reserve
fleet
down
by
norfolk
up
to
philadelphia
where
the
cheap
bidding
contractor
was
situated
and
then
turned
her
over.
now,
they
went
on
for
20
days
after
mr.
west
was
injured
in
order
to
get
her
in
shape
to
be
properly
seaworthy
for
a
voyage.
now,
this
is
the
only
kind
of
seaworthiness,
it
seems
to
me,
which
is
real
seaworthiness,
worthy
to
go
to
sea.
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
where
passengers
and
where
shippers
are
concerned.
now,
mr.
freedman
not
unnaturally
says,
“let
us
imply
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness,”
seaworthiness
now
means
something
else.
seaworthiness
means
being
in
good
enough
shape
to
be
in
a
repair
yard.
now,
in
our
brief,
we
have
very
carefully
pointed
out
that
two
courts
below
have
found
correctly
in
our
view
that
this
vessel
was
in
proper
shape
and
in
that
sense
seaworthy
to
go
into
a
repair
yard.
we
don't
think
that
this
is
any
proper
use
of
the
term
seaworthiness
at
all,
although
goodness
knows
there
have
been
dozens
of
judicial
opinions
which
have
used
the
word
that
way.
one
of
the
earliest
is
that
of
judge
parker
in
united
states
and
lindgren
where
he
spoke
about
the
seaworthiness
of
a
vessel
which
had
just
come
from
repairs.
it's
a
rather
special
case
of
course.
the
man
had
joined
on
as
the
ship's
officer
the
very
morning
that
he
was
injured
and
the
vessel
was
just
about
ready
to
go
to
sea.
so
it
differs
only
a
little
bit
from
a
vessel
really
ready
to
go
out.
that
is
why
all
of
the
decisions
and
all
of
the
decisions
as
to
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
--
to
cargo
shippers
say,
“well,
it's
not
a
matter
of
principle,
it's
a
matter
of
fact
in
each
case.”
another
case
that
mr.
freedman
relies
on
at
length
in
his
brief
is
the
reed
case.
now,
the
reed
case
was
a
repair
case
so
called,
but
what
we
have
there
was,
without
ever
discharging
the
crew,
at
any
time,
because
there
was
a
war
on,
we
had
to
keep
them,
they
might
get
--
we
might
be
without
a
crew.
they
proceeded
to
--
in
five
days,
set
up
latrines
and
wooden
bunks
in
the
cargo
holds
in
order
to
make
a
make-shift
troop
transport.
now,
in
that
case
one
of
the
repairmen
was
injured.
we
think
that
under
our
conception
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness,
of
course
there
was
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
there
because
the
vessel
was
--
ended
one
voyage
and
began
the
other.
and
five
days
is
no
more
than
a
normal
turnaround
even
if
you
didn't
have
to
put
some
buck
--
bunks
in
it.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
because
i
think
we've
had
a
number
of
cases
in
this
court
now
on
this
problem
and
in
view
of
the
difference
of
opinion
between
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
thought
that
so
far
as
the
admiralty
work
of
the
government
is
concerned,
it
might
be
well
if
these
problems
were
explored
now
because
they're
going
to
go
on
as
we
have
observed
they're
factual.
we
cannot
have
a
couple
of
cases
coming
up
to
this
court
at
each
term.
so
that
if
your
honor
please
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that's
right.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right,
sir,
because
we
have
many
hundreds,
such
cases.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
to
my
recollection,
i'm
probably
wrong,
is
that
we
have
now
pending
in
the
admiralty
section
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
75
cases
involving
this
problem.
now,
addressing
ourselves
to
the
narrow
ground,
yes
if
seaworthiness
merely
means
fit
for
a
purpose,
this
vessel
was
fit
for
the
purpose.
in
other
words,
everyone
was
on
notice
that
the
piping
system
was
in
a
precarious
shape
and
mr.
west
and
others
came
aboard
to
see
to
it.
there's
nothing
latent
about
it.
she
was
in
that
state
proper
to
be
repaired.
now,
we
just
don't
feel
that
that
is
what,
under
this
court's
decisions
and
indeed
the
best
considered
decisions
of
lower
courts
which
we've
explained
at
length
in
our
brief
that
the
implied
warranty
of
seaworthiness
is
an
implied
warranty
of
seaworthiness
where
there
is
no
going
to
sea
upon
a
voyage
involved
but
merely
a
matter
of
the
fitness
of
equipment.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right.
in
view
of
the
origin
of
the
implied
warrant
of
seaworthiness
which
is
founded
by
this
court
upon
the
implied
warranty
of
seaworthiness
for
a
voyage
which
was
made
to
cargo
shippers
and
to
passengers
who
were
people
who
were
concerned
only
with
what
goes
on
with
the
voyage
from
the
time
they
begin
to
put
the
first
parcel
of
cargo,
undertake
all
to
the
time
they
get
the
last
parcel
off
and
of
course,
the
same
way
with
passengers,
first
one
goes
up
the
gangway
and
the
last
one
comes
down.
now
even
these
cases
that
we
have
some
more
coming
along
of
involving
this
so-called
transitory
seaworthiness
like
mr.
justice
harlan's
decision
in
dickson
and
--
mr.
--
judge
magruder's
decision
in
mitchell
and
the
trawler
racer
and
the
cookingham
case
in
third
circuit.
these
are
all
questions
of
--
during
the
voyage.
what
is
the
scope?
how
--
how
about
these
situations
where
the
vessel
is
seaworthy
when
she
leaves
port
on
the
voyage
if
something
happens
in
the
course
of
it?
now,
that's
--
that
is
another
problem,
but
those
again
are
during
the
voyage
and
we
submit
that
here,
there
is
no
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
be
in
a
repair
yard
that
if
there
is
something
which
is
not
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
but
some
kind
of
new
warranty
of
fitness,
which
is
to
be
implied
by
this
court
for
the
first
time
during
repairs
and
we
think
that
it
should
not,
that
it
should
be
done
by
the
same
principles
as
the
construction
of
a
ship
originally
then
of
course
we
say
that
the
vessel
is
clearly
fit
for
the
purpose
of
repairing.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
under
the
cases
with
respect
to
cargo,
they
are
very
specifically
limited.
now,
so
far
as
this
court
has
gone
yet
in
each
case
for
seamen
and
repairmen
and
longshoremen,
this
court
has
not
yet
extended
an
implied
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
a
situation
which
did
not
involve
seaworthiness
for
the
voyage
and
i
come
back
to
my
analysis
of
the
concept
of
the
breach
of
the
implied
warranty.
in
other
words,
is
there
an
implied
warranty
or
are
there
facts
and
circumstances
which
show
that
no
warranty
was
implied?
now,
we
represented
and
warranted
in
this
case
that
the
vessel
had
to
have
20
days
more
work
done
on
her
before
she
was
seaworthy
for
a
voyage.
on
the
other
hand,
we
say
that
she
was
in
fit
shape
to
undertake
the
repairs.
there
were
no
--
no
traps
for
a
workman
aboard.
now,
we
might
say
a
word
about
the
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
please,
sir.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
if
your
honor
please,
the
conception
of
what
is
and
is
not
navigation
as
mr.
freedman
has
shown
you
is
a
very
difficult
and
surely
factual
problem.
we
suspect
that
the
vessel
is
impliedly
warranted
as
seaworthy
for
a
voyage
about
the
time
she
takes
aboard
a
crew,
but
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
so.
the
crew
comes
on
very
often
one
by
one
and
so
forth.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
same
thing
it,
is
a
factual
problem.
the
same
as
it
is
with
respect
to
shippers
and
passengers.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
there
will
still
have
to
be
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
factual
determinations,
yes
if
your
honor
please,
but
we
do
feel
that
the
factual
determination
should
be
put
on
something,
on
some
base
which
is
consonant
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
limited
it
to
loading,
course
of
voyage
and
unloading
and
which
are
consonant
with
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
shippers
and
passengers
from
which
the
one
in
favor
of
seamen
and
other
workers
has
been
implied.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right.
and
that
is
why
as
i
conceive
it,
mr.
freedman
is
asking
for
the
development
and
creation
of
a
new
rule,
one
which
this
court
at
any
rate
has
not
yet
created,
although
there
is
some
confusion
in
lower
courts
and
some
of
them
seem
to
have
thought
that
they
found
one.
