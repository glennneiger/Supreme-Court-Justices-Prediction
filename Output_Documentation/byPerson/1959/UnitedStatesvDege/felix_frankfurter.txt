justice
felix
frankfurter
in
respecting
all
this
your
arguing
first
off
what
--
what
i've
heard,
it
goes
to
immediate
question
of
evolution
in
the
common
law,
isn't
that
affair
(inaudible)
arguing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
are
dealing
with
the
statute
here,
and
what
i'd
like
to
ask
you
is
what
do
you
think
if
this
case
could
come
up
before
this
court
in
1868
the
year
after
the
statue
was
originally
passed,
do
you
think
that
if
any
of
these
(inaudible)
that
would
have
been
construed
the
way
you
want
us
now
construe
it
or
i'll
give
you
a
later
date
1909
it
was
readopt
--
adapted
by
the
penal
code,
do
you
think
then
it
would
have
been
construed
other
than
if
you
are
one
person
and
not
being
husband
and
wife
but
that
--
that
would
have
been
the
construction,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
statute
then
in
effect
is
presented
as
we're
not
say
two
or
more
persons
not
being
husband
and
wife,
you
couldn't
possibly
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
if
that
is
the
construction
that
unreasonably
is
attributed
to
that
language
either
in
1867
or
1909
that
does
not
probably
now
we
need
that
reply
qualification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
could
argued,
but
you
won't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
it's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
merely
of
question
of
proof.
that
is
not
a
qualification
for
taking
control
out
of
the
focus
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
i
suppose
when
you're
saying
that
this
is
not
--
it
didn't
come
up
in
1867
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
1909
and
therefore
there
hasn't
been
a
past
law
and
this
is
1959
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
they
re-enacted
it
in
1948,
title
18
re-enacted,
didn't
(inaudible)
state
of
change
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
don't
need
to
state
it
unless
we
heard
you
say
so.
they
don't
need
to
change
it
unless
we
go
straight,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
drawing
heavily
on
(inaudible)
to
say
that
in
48
congress
enacted
by
implication
the
decision
of
the
district
columbia
court
of
appeals.
that's
it
talking
a
little
far
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
re-enacted
--
