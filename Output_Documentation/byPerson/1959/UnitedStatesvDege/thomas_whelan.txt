mr.
thomas
whelan
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
hope
the
court
won't
mind
of
my
stating
that
this,
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
appearance
before
the
court
where
i
addressed
the
court
in
a
case
that
i
say
that
i
feel
rather
good
about
coming
here
from
san
diego
to
represent
clients
who
are
--
what
we
might
call
just
the
average
ordinary
person
to
come
here
in
a
contest
with
the
united
states
government
itself
and
to
be
heard
by
this
court,
we
have
all
of
the
right
of
these
two
individuals
being
as
fully
recognized
and
as
fully
protected
as
the
rights
of
the
government
itself.
but
on
saturday
evening
i
received
an
advanced
copy
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
government
and
today
i
received
the
printed
copy
from
the
reply
brief.
and
in
this
printed
reply
brief
there
are
about
two
points
raised.
one
being,
that
some
consideration
ought
to
be
given
to
the
proposition
that
because
in
1948
following
the
decision
by
the
circuit
court
of
the
district
of
colombia
that
the
congress
didn't
make
any
exception
in
favor
of
husband
and
wife
with
reference
to
this
conspiracy
statute.
there
are
a
few
notes
that
i've
had
made
in
that
regard.
i'd
like
to
call
of
court
attention
that
this
conspiracy
statute
was
–
as
has
been
stated
here,
first
inactive
in
1867.
now,
for
a
period
of
approximately
42
years
after
that
the
statute
was
not
changed
or
re-enacted
and
during
that
period
of
time
there
were
judicial
decisions
of
state
courts
which
held
that
husband
and
wife
alone
could
not
be
guilty
of
a
crime
of
conspiracy.
one
of
which
was
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
in
the
case
of
people
versus
miller
which
is
referred
to
inside
and
i
think
a
brief
the
appellants
as
well
as
the
appellees.
again,
this
statute
was
re-enacted
in
1909
and
there
wasn't
any
change
made
in
the
first
six
lines
at
least
of
the
--
first
six
words
of
the
statute.
then
in
1940
when
the
statute
was
re-enacted
into
the
criminal
code
18
u.s.c.
why
there
had
been
at
that
time
the
decision
in
the
case
of
dawson
versus
the
united
states
which
is
a
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
unequivocally
held
that
husband
and
wife
could
not
because
of
their
common
law
unity
constitute
the
two
persons
who
could
conspire
under
the
federal
statutes.
and
in
1940
when
congress
re-enacted
the
statute
it
again
used
the
same
first
six
words,
"if
two
or
more
persons
conspire".
now,
under
the
familiar
rule
of
legislative
re-enactment
without
change
operates
as
an
adoption
of
the
prior
judicial
construction
given
to
statute,
we
feel
that
congress
clearly
intended
that
the
conspiracy
statute
as
it
re-enacted
in
1940
should
not
include
husband
and
wife
alone
and
that
husband
and
wife
were
to
be
accepted
from
the
provisions
of
the
conspiracy
statute.
now,
the
next
decision
of
any
moment
was
in
1943
in
the
case
of
gros
versus
the
united
states
and
again
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
holding
that
husband
and
wife
alone
could
not
be
guilty
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy
against
the
united
states.
and
the
first
decision
of
the
federal
court
was
this
case
for
johnson
versus
the
united
states
decided
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
and
that
is
referred
to
in
the
brief
but
i
won't
comment
further
on
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
leaves
as
sort
of
a
situation
where
if
there's
going
to
be
any
change
in
the
law,
the
change
ought
to
be
made
by
the
congress
and
not
by
the
court.
now,
i
--
mr.
thomas
whelan
dege
is
the
way
you
pronounce
it
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
whelan
i
--
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
think
all
three
because
i
think
that
the
two
deges
constitute
one
person
at
least
under
as
the
way
i
understand
the
federal
construction
in
our
circuit
at
least
john
smith
would
be
the
other
person
and
therefore
there
would
be
two
or
more
persons
and
i
think
that
both
of
the
deges
if
they
were
charged
in
such
an
indictment
could
be
convicted.
mr.
thomas
whelan
well,
if
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
whelan
well,
there
actually
are
two
physical
persons
but
as
a
matter
of
the
law
they're
one
identity.
i
think
dege
alone
could
be
charged
in
a
conspiracy
with
john
smith
or
mrs.
dege
alone,
but
two
of
them
together
with
john
smith
but
not
the
two
themselves
alone.
i
think
--
i
don't
think
the
honorable
james
carter
would
be
flattered
by
the
statement
that
he
decided
this
on
an
ancient
notion
of
marital
unity.
i
think
his
words
were
that
he
follow
the
circuit
and
that's
--
that's
what
he
did,
but
the
--
i
think
that
the
things
that
have
been
argued
here
have
been
discussed
pretty
generally
in
this
brief
which
we
filed.
there
is
one
more
thing
that
was
raised
in
this
reply
brief
which
is
a
reference
to
the
case
of
people
versus
morton,
this
new
york
case
where
a
husband
was
indicted
for
larceny
of
his
wife's
property
and
before
the
married
women's
statute
of
new
york,
he
couldn't
have
been
indicted.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
says
in
their
opinion,
but
all
that
--
this
case
says
is
this,
that
the
new
york
legislature
has
the
right
to
pass
statutes
which
change
the
status
of
married
people
as
to
property
rights
differentiating
from
their
status
prior
to
those
statues
by
the
common
law.
and
therefore
when
the
statute
says
that
the
husband
doesn't
have
any
property
interest
in
his
wife's
property
that
it
belongs
to
her,
he
can
be
prosecuted
for
--
for
stealing
that
property
and
it
doesn't
have
any
effect
upon
the
marital
unity
or
the
marital
relationship
itself,
it
just
has
to
do
with
that
particular
question
of
property
that's
involved
and
we
have
the
same
situation
in
california
i
believe
in
the
footnote
here
they
cite
the
case
of
people
versus
gros
right
in
59
cal.
app.
706
which
i
--
wherever
i
start
in
19
--
and
that's
a
case
where
the
an
indictment
was
returned
charging
a
man
--
woman
with
the
investment
of
her
husband's
property
and
forgery
of
her
husband's
name
to
require
that
property.
and
the
demurrer
and
the
motion
set
aside
the
indictment
or
sustained
by
the
trial
court,
but
reversed
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
saying
that
the
--
because
that
the
property
rights
of
the
husband
and
wife
weren't
separate,
the
wife
could
be
prosecuted
for
stealing
the
husband's
property
or
forging
his
name.
but
at
the
same
time
that
the
district
court
of
appeals
was
affirming
this
doctrine
that
it
stated
in
people
versus
gros,
some
years
later
in
this
macmillan
case
the
district
court
of
appeals
says,
that
husband
and
wife
can't
commit
conspiracy
in
california
and
the
rule
was
laid
down
in
people
versus
miller,
but
says
that
justice
who
wrote
that
opinion
the
supreme
court
ought
to
do
something
about
that
or
the
legislature
ought
to
do
something
about
it.
in
other
words,
if
there
was
to
be
a
change
in
the
law
and
it
was
recommended
that
the
supreme
court
or
the
legislature
take
some
action
to
declare
the
status
of
husband
and
wife
so
that
there
would
be
a
positive
statement
again
whether
they
could
or
could
not
be
guilty
of
conspiracy.
mr.
thomas
whelan
that
is
correct
and
the
california
supreme
court
denied
the
petition
for
a
hearing
which
was
asked
by
the
prosecution
in
that
case.
and
the
legislature
of
course
never
accepted
the
invitation
to
declare
that
husband
and
wife
could
be
guilty
of
conspiracy.
now,
i
think
from
the
language
of
the
government's
brief
here
that
they're
asking
this
court
to
not
only
reverse
the
ruling
of
the
united
states
district
court,
but
they're
asking
this
court
to
lay
down
a
series
of
rules
of
procedure
in
the
--
and
the
changed
rules
of
evidence
that
have
been
a
long
time
in
existence
and
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
the
problems
that
they
raise
in
their
brief
are
matters
that
ought
to
be
addressed
to
the
congress
and
not
to
this
court.
although
counsel
can
see
no
difficulty
because
of
a
ruling
in
the
hawkins
case
if
this
--
if
this
case
was
to
be
reversed
here,
it
seems
to
me
like
there
would
be
nothing
but
difficulty,
there
would
be
nothing
but
questions
of
the
rights
in
some
cases
of
a
defendant
even
testifying
for
herself
or
himself
that
depending
upon
the
objection
of
--
of
the
other
party
if
often
this
to
be
given
effect,
well,
i
don't
know
where
husband
and
wife
would
be
if
they
happen
to
be
adverse
to
each
other
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
the
reasoning
behind
the
decision
in
the
case
of
dawson
versus
the
united
states
and
gros
versus
united
states
are
well-founded
and
sound
and
that
the
congress
must
have
had
the
dawson
case
in
mind
at
least
in
1940
and
that
the
congress
impliedly
approved
the
rule
in
the
dawson
case
and
therefore
that's
what
the
statute
means.
it
means,
if
two
or
more
persons
accepting
husband
and
wife
and
what
according
to
dawson
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
statute
means
and
the
legislature
--
or
the
congress
must
have
meant
the
some
things
when
they
re-enacted
the
statute
in
1940,
but
the
government
wants
this
court
to
say
is
this.
“if
two
or
more
persons
including
husband
and
wife
conspire”
and
now,
we
feel,
i
certainly
feel
as
a
matter
of
correct
procedure
that
if
the
changes
to
be
made
in
the
statute
that
are
not
to
be
made
by
the
congress
and
we
respectfully
submit
the
matter
--
mr.
thomas
whelan
well,
lets
take
this
situation.
if
the
government
should
indict
a
man
and
his
wife
for
the
crime
of
conspiracy
and
then
should
indict
the
man
for
two
or
three
more
substantiative
offences
relating
to
the
conspiracy,
but
not
indict
the
wife
as
to
those
substantiative
offences.
if
the
prosecution
put
on
the
case
--
the
government
put
on
the
case
and
it
was
a
sort
of
a
thin
line
proposition,
the
wife
who
was
actually
not
guilty
of
any
crime
wanted
to
take
the
stand
in
her
own
behalf
and
testify
in
exonerating
herself
she
might
implicate
her
husband.
therefore,
if
he
objected
to
his
wife
of
his
testifying
as
he
didn't
–
would
have
a
right
to
do
under
hawkins
she'd
be
precluded
it
would
seem
to
me
from
going
ahead
and
testifying
on
her
own
behalf,
exonerating
herself
because
of
the
objection
he
made.
and
that's
a
complication
that
it
seems
to
me
could
have
occur
and
what
is
to
be
done
about
it.
mr.
thomas
whelan
well,
i
think
if
they
had
a
codefendant
that
this
privilege
of
--
in
favor
the
husband
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
control
the
admission
of
the
evidence
there
if
she
could
testify
against
john
smith
and
she
could
exonerate
herself
and
i
--
i
don't
see
how
in
that
case
that
the
husband
could
prevent
her
from
testifying
in
--
on
her
own
behalf.
there
might
be
some
rule
of
evidence
that
would
provide
that
the
evidence
wouldn't
be
considered
admissible
against
the
husband.
i
don't
know
how
that
would
work
out
but
i
think
that
she
could
testify
if
there
was
a
third
defendant
but
if
it
were
just
her
husband
alone
i
rather
doubt
that
she
could.
mr.
thomas
whelan
there
would
be
certainly
a
question
but
i
don't
think
the
question
would
be
as
great
as
that
she
and
her
husband
were
alone
indicted.
supposing
they
were
just
indicted
on
the
conspiracy
charge
and
she
wanted
to
testify
and
her
husband
didn't
want
her
to,
wouldn't
that
create
a
problem?
mr.
thomas
whelan
well,
i
would
think
that
as
a
practical
proposition
you
never
get
separate
trial.
mr.
thomas
whelan
well,
as
a
practical
the
proposition
there
is
i'm
defendant
a
lot
of
conspiracy
issues
and
i
think
in
every
case
that
made
a
motion
for
a
severance
and
i
have
normally
--
mr.
thomas
whelan
to
have
a
severance,
yes.
if
it
can
be
obtained,
but
it's
very
difficult
to
obtain
one.
mr.
thomas
whelan
well,
yes.
it
--
mr.
thomas
whelan
if
--
if
there
would
be
pronouncement
from
the
congress
or
some
direction
or
suggestion
by
this
court
that
the
trial
courts
ought
to
grant
severances
in
such
situation
it
probably
would
mean
they
were
able
--
the
severance
would
be
easier
to
get
and
it
would
be
beneficial
to
defendants
--
mr.
thomas
whelan
that's
it,
but
i
don't
say
that
hawkins
doesn't
control
the
decision
in
this
case.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
hawkins
goes
far
enough
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
that
marital
unity
ought
to
be
preserved
and
for
that
reason
husband
and
wife
should
not
--
should
not
be
permitted
to
testify
against
the
other
over
objection.
and
if
that's
good
reasoning
then
husband
and
wife
should
not
be
joined
together
as
conspirators
because
in
such
a
case
is
that
very
unlikely
there
would
be
a
separation
between
husband
and
wife.
one
would
blame
the
other
and
it
would
result
in
a
widespread
differences
and
the
breaking
up
for
that
particular
home
and
would
have
a
tendency
to
--
to
cause
that
effect
in
every
case
where
two
parties,
husband
and
wife
alone
were
conspirators,
i
think
just
as
it
would
cause
difficulty
as
set
by
the
supreme
court
in
hawkins
case
where
a
wife
testified
against
her
husband
or
vice
versa.
