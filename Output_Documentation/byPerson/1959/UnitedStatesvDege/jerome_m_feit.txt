mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california,
dismissing
an
indictment
which
charged
appellees,
who
are
husband
and
wife,
with
conspiracy
to
smuggle
psittacine
bird
into
this
country
from
mexico.
the
single
issue
on
this
appeal
is
whether
or
not
husband
and
wife
can
conspire
under
the
federal
conspiracy
statute.
there
is
no
additional
evidentiary
question
as
to
whether
one
spouse
may
testify
against
the
other
nor
as
to
whether
confidential
communications
between
husband
and
wife
may
be
revealed,
solely
whether
husband
and
wife
are
two
separate
individuals
within
the
purview
of
a
federal
statute.
the
court
below
relying
upon
the
ancient
notion
of
marital
unity
found
that
husband
and
wife
were
not
two
persons
but
one
and
on
this
basis,
dismissed
the
indictment.
we
think
that
ruling
was
incorrect.
the
federal
conspiracy
statute
18
u.s.c.
371
which
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
our
main
brief
punishes
conspiracy
between
two
or
more
persons.
there
is
no
limitation
in
that
statute
which
says,
"two
or
more
persons
except
if
they're
husband
and
wife."
in
present
day
terms
it
is
clear,
we
think,
that
husband
and
wife
are
legally
separate
individuals.
plus
in
old
states
under
the
married
women
statutes,
she
may
own
her
property
separate
and
apart
from
her
husband.
she
may
sue
and
be
sued
in
tort
and
in
contract.
she
may
contract
with
third
parties.
her
citizenship
does
not
follow
that
of
her
husband
and
quite
significantly,
we
think,
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
jurisdiction
she
is
deemed
a
separate
legal
person
who
can
civilly
contract
with
her
husband.
in
our
view,
if
man
and
wife
are
two
separate
individuals,
two
separate
persons,
for
the
purpose
of
contractual
capacity,
we
certainly
think
that
they
are
within
reach
and
are
two
separate
persons
under
the
federal
conspiracy
statute.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
have
read
the
hawkins
the
decision.
it
deals
with
a
rule
of
evidence
which
is
based
upon
the
notion,
the
present
day
notion
that
in
order
to
protect
the
domestic
relationship
of
husband
and
wife,
neither
spouse
should
be
allowed
to
testify
against
the
other.
it
does
not
in
our
view
deal
with
this
problem
at
all
because
on
--
on
the
theory
that
it
did,
it
would
mean
that
husband
and
wife
could
not
be
convicted
together
of
the
subsequent
of
defense,
which
is
certainly
not
the
law.
again,
if
a
third
party
joined
the
conspiracy
it
is
clear
that
husband,
wife
and
the
third
party,
each
to
be
separately
tried
and
punished.
we
think
that
to
say
that
the
hawkins
case,
applies
here
is
to
expand
it
beyond
its
purpose.
it
is
in
fact
to
say,
that
under
all
circumstances
despite
the
evidence,
despite
the
proof,
husband
and
wife
upon
some
outmoded
fiction
of
unity
cannot
conspire.
turning
to
the
criminal
status,
criminal
independence,
the
criminal
responsibility
of
a
married
woman
present
time
is
clear
that
in
those
jurisdictions,
majority
of
jurisdictions
which
have
dealt
with
the
problem
of
whether
one
spouse
may
steal
from
another
which
derive
from
the
same
fiction
of
the
unity
the
rule
that
neither
spouse
could
steal
from
one
another,
is
derived
from
the
same
fiction
of
unity
which
the
district
court
applied
here
to
support
this
notion
that
they
could
not
conspire
together.
the
majority
of
jurisdictions
in
this
country
which
have
dealt
with
this
problem
have
held
husband
and
wife
can
steal
from
one
another
if
they
are
separate
and
discreet
individuals.
most
recently
in
fact
and
i
might
point
out
this
is
noted
at
page
three
of
our
reply
brief,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
1954
held
in
the
case
of
people
against
morton
and
it's
cited
to
page
two
and
three
of
our
reply
brief,
held
that
a
husband
may
steal
from
his
wife
but
she
was
a
separate
person
within
the
new
york
larceny
statute.
again
at
the
common
law
there
was
a
presumption
that
a
married
woman
who
committed
a
crime
in
her
husband's
presence
acted
under
his
control
and
coercion.
this
presumption
derived
from
perhaps
a
more
realistic
view
of
the
legal
relationship
of
husband
and
wife
at
common
law.
that
is
that
the
wife
was
subservient
to
and
under
the
control
of
her
husband,
that
she
was
under
his
dominance,
nonetheless
and
at
least
21
jurisdictions
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
this
presumption
has
been
overturned
and
in
those
jurisdictions
in
order
to
support
the
defense
the
married
woman
must
show
affirmatively
that
she
was
acting
under
the
control
of
her
husband.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
in
the
federal
court
the
presumption
is
very
slight
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
this
is
a
matter
of
case
law
and
federal
courts.
in
the
state
in
some
jurisdictions
it
is
a
matter
of
statute.
the
legislature
had
abolished
the
presumption.
in
a
number
of
other
states
i
believe
six
or
seven,
this
is
set
out
at
page
21
of
our
main
brief,
page
21
and
22,
in
six
or
seven
states,
the
--
the
termination
reputing
any
presumption
was
by
judiciary.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
may
i
say,
at
least
from
reading
the
cases,
if
there
is
a
presumption
it
is
at
--
of
the
weakest
nature.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
exactly
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
was
even
in
those
states
which
retained
the
presumption,
a
slight
showing
that
the
wife
was
acting
independently
off
her
husband,
revised
it.
at
the
--
again
at
the
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
--
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
the
trend.
i
might
say
the
trend
of
recent
decisions
exemplified
by
united
states
against
anthony,
a
district
court
case,
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
presumption
is
either
hanging
by
a
slim
thread
and
ready
to
go,
i
think
perhaps
that
federal
court
view
would
be
following
the
--
the
majority
view
i
think
in
any
recent
cases
--
any
new
case
which
might
arise.
not
only
--
another
example
of
this
independent
status
to
the
married
woman,
was
that,
she
could
always
be
guilty
and
contrived
with
inciting
her
husband
for
the
commission
of
a
substantive
offence.
certainly
it
seems
as
if
a
married
woman
can
control
and
direct
her
husband's
criminal
action,
criminal
activity.
she
can
be
charged
with
agreeing
with
him
in
the
commission
of
crime.
what
we
think
is
that
the
ruling
below
was
to
read
in
to
the
federal
conspiracy
statute
an
exception
which
derives
from
an
ancient
notion,
an
ancient
notion
of
marital
unity
which
derived
essentially
from
the
writing
of
text
writers
from
hawkins
and
from
thence
into
the
case
law.
we
think
that
in
light
of
the
present
day
realities
which
indicate
that
all
circumstances,
but
civilly
and
criminally,
a
wife
is
legally
distinct
and
separate
from
her
husband
but
this
court
may
read
that
exception
out
and
say
that
the
district
court
was
wrong,
it
was
improperly
reading
the
federal
conspiracy
statute.
in
this
recent
new
york
case
of
people
against
morton
which
is
referred
to
at
page
two
and
three
of
our
reply
brief
and
this
is
a
response
to
the
claim
by
my
opponent
that
we
request
the
court
to
indulge
in
judicial
legislation.
that
same
argument
was
made
in
the
new
york
courts
with
respect
to
this
--
this
concept
that
husband
and
wife
cannot
steal
from
one
another,
a
concept
which
derived
from
the
same
fiction
of
unity
as
this
conspiracy
rational
adopted
by
the
court
below.
the
district
court
recognized
--
i
mean
--
i'm
sorry,
the
appellant
division
in
new
york
recognized
that
this
was
an
essential
judicial
function,
that
where
legislature
had
not
acted,
the
new
york
courts
very
properly
could
view
the
larceny
statute
the
word
“another”
as
including
a
married
woman.
so
here,
we
think
it
is
a
proper
function
of
this
court
to
recognize
that
a
vestige,
an
ancient
vestige
of
the
common
law
is
no
longer
in
force
and
at
the
conspiracy
statute
means
what
it
says,
that
two
or
more
persons,
and
not
two
or
more
persons,
excluding
husband
and
wife,
but
two
or
more
persons
who
conspire
can
be
charged
and
convicted.
in
1913,
mr.
justice
holmes
referred
to
this
ancient
notion
for
marital
unity
as
now
vanishing
fiction.
we
certainly
believe
that
this
court
will
recognize
in
the
present
day
considerations
and
the
present
day
conditions
that
this
fiction
has
actually
vanished.
moreover,
we
do
not
think
that
there
are
any
present
day
policy
considerations
which
would
support
the
retention
of
this
vestige,
this
notion
that
husband
and
wife
are
one
and
therefore
cannot
conspire
together.
those
that
have
been
asserted
in
our
view
are
essentially
evidentiary
rules
which
are
adequately
protected
under
existing
rules
of
exclusion.
so
for
example
mr.
justice
harlan,
hawkins
decision
announces
this
court's
view
that
either
spouse
could
testify
against
one
another.
certainly
it
is
no
reason
we
think
to
--
there
is
no
reason
to
expand
that
decision,
beyond
its
limits
to
say
that
under
no
circumstances
apart
from
what
evidence
maybe
adduced,
husband
and
wife
cannot
conspire
together.
similarly
the
argument
deriving
from
the
notion
of
marital
confidences,
there
is
a
similar
evidentiary
rule
which
we
do
not
challenge
here
and
which
is
validly
recognized,
the
confidential
communications
between
husband
and
wife
are
not
to
be
revealed.
certainly,
that
rule
will
be
applied
on
trial,
but
again
it
is
a
--
there
is
no
reason,
no
justification,
we
submit,
for
extending
that
rule
so
that
it
becomes
an
immutable
substance
of
rule
which
carves
out
for
husband
and
wife
an
area
of
immunity
from
criminal
liability.
other
individuals
having
a
relationship
of
confidence
certainly
do
not
enjoy
such
a
position
in
a
law.
husband
and
wife
can
conspire
with
their
children.
brothers
and
sisters
can
conspire
together.
attorney
and
client
have
a
confidential
communication
privilege
relating
to
their
confidences
and
certainly
my
opponent
would
not
say
that
for
that
reason
they're
entitled
to
a
rule
precluding
criminal
responsibility
if
they
conspire
together.
we
recognize
--
we
think
this
is
the
essence
of
the
matter
that
at
a
trial
there
maybe
in
any
particular
case
difficulties
in
proof.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
husband
and
wife
can
be
charged
under
the
federal
statute.
as
we
suggest
in
our
main
brief,
it
might
be
appropriate
at
the
trial
of
any
particular
case
for
the
trial
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
that
associations
between
husband
and
wife
certainly
do
not
have
the
same
--
do
not
--
would
not
have
the
same
inference
that
perhaps
association,
clandestine
association
between
strangers
might
have
with
respect
to
conspiracy.
again
this
presumption
of
rule
which
i
had
mentioned
might
be
necessary
to
indicate
to
the
jury
that
there
was
a
presumption
that
one
of
the
partners
whether
husband
or
wife
was
under
the
control
of
the
other
and
they
might
indulge
in
that
presumption,
but
this
all
goes
to
the
question
of
proof?
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
agree
with
that.
the
construction
in
1868
or
construction
in
1909
would
have
been
that.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
exactly.
but
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
may
i
answer
the
question
this
way
mr.
justice.
i
agree
that
in
1867
and
in
1909
such
a
construction
would
be
proper
because
of
this
judicial
theory
which
had
been
engrafted
into
--
in
interpreting
the
federal
conspiracy
statue.
we
could
have
argued
here
that
if
by
readapting
the
statute
in
1948
as
part
of
the
re-adaption
in
title
18
to
positive
of
law
and
by
not
noting
the
exception
at
the
time
when
husband
and
wife
were
clearly
separate
and
discreet
legal
individuals.
congress
indicated
an
intent
to
cover
them
in
the
statute.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no
were
not.
but
we
argue
which
we
think
is
the
--
is
the
proper
argument.
this
is
a
question
of
capacity.
that
this
question
as
--
derives
from
a
judicial
rule
which
was
read
into
the
conspiracy
statute.
certainly
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--
but
certainly
--
certainly
with
respect
to
the
insanity
rule
for
example,
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
in
every
criminal
statute
adopted
any
specific
rule
of
insanity
existing
at
any
particular
time.
and
certainly
this
court
would
not
say
that
a
statute
is
frozen
if
adopted
in
1867
when
--
when
the
rule
might
have
been
solely
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
by
the
same
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
i
--
i
will
let
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes
sir.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
those
decisions
--
the
district
of
colombia
decision
was
in
1946.
the
fifth
circuit,
the
first
fifth
circuit
decision
was
in
1955.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
believe
it
was
1955
mr.
justice.
they
have
been
later
fifth
circuit
decisions
which
we
also
know
in
1958,
but
the
district
of
colombia
circuit
decision
was
in
1946.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
in
1948
certainly
when
title
18
was
readopted
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--
positive
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
and
the
revises
no
--
it
would
so
stay
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that's
right
sir.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
--
i
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
we
--
as
i
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
law
was,
yes.
and
i
might
mention
that
the
decision
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--
in
california
was
in
1926
the
first
one
in
43,
the
second
one.
we
think
then
that
this
ancient
notion
of
marital
unity
cannot
support
the
reading
of
conspiracy
statute
which
the
district
court
has
given
it
nor
do
we
think
that
there
are
any
policy
considerations
which
would
warrant
such
a
reading
in
the
statute.
we
think
therefore
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
order
of
the
district
court
and
remand
the
case
back
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
under
the
indictment.
thank
you.
