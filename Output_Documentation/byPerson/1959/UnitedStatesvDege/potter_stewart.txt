justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
respect
what
is
the
presumption
and
was
the
--what
is
the
way
that
the
presumption
if
any
in
the
federal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
a
matter
of
case
law
or
legal
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
does
continue
a
presumption
in
the
federal
court
in
federal
criminal
cases
and
a
weak
resumption
you
tell
us?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
could
that
be
showing
all
in
the
federal
court
which
he
be
entitled
to
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal,
if
there
were
no
showing
the
contract
made
by
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
now
two
court
appeals
--
you
represented
to
us
and
i
agree
with
your
position
on
that
(inaudible)
the
court
appeals
on
the
--
on
appeals
with
fifth
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
i
appreciate
that
your
opponent
said
that
district
columbia
court
is
perhaps
just
(inaudible)
local
rule,
but
in
any
even
when
did
--
when
--
when
those
decisions
with
reference
to
any
re-enactment
of
the
federal
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
there
was
at
least
formal
re-enactment
of
the
statute
in
1948.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
the
law
wasn't
conflict
as
of
that
date.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
whelan
so
that
i
could
understand
your
position
is
to
what
the
law
now
is,
would
you
concede
that
there
could
be
a
criminal
conviction
of
mr.
and
mrs.
dege,
how
do
you
pronounce
your
--?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
if
lucille
dege
and
ernest
dege
and
john
smith
had
been
indicted
of
a
criminal
conspiracy,
could
all
three
of
them
convicted?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
though
--
you
said
the
one
person,
but
each
separately
could
be
convicted
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
each
sent
to
separate
prisons.
justice
potter
stewart
this
reference
is
to
a
california
supreme
court
and
not
the
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
--
before
you
sit
you
down.
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
your
concern
about
the
effect
of
the
hawkins
decision
(inaudible)
in
this
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
how
would
any
difficulties
be
present
and
that
situation
that
would
not
be
present
if
they
were
both
indicted
and
being
tried
or
substantive
offences
for
the
same
--
commission
of
the
same
substantive
offence
or
conversely
have
in
any
problems
to
be
present
in
your
hypothetical
case
it
wouldn't
be
present
if
mr.
and
mrs.
dege
or
has
a
--
a
codefendant
john
smith.
but
you've
conceded
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
certainly
at
least
to
be
questioned
to
whether
or
not
she
could
testify,
if
there
is
a
third
defendant
it
would
be
effective
for
her
to
testify
it
would
be
adverse
to
her
husband
under
the
profits
decision
that
that
there
at
least
would
be
a
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
there
any
difficulty
about
having
a
severance
and
having
separate
trials
for
conspirators
even
though
you
know
there
are
only
two
conspirators?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not
is
there
any
difficulty
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
normally
that's
the
advantage
of
the
defendants,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
wouldn't
be
very
evidentiary
testimony
or
problems
that
you
suggest
and
i
--
wouldn't
they
give
a
reason
for
a
court
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
discretion
to
grant
separate
trail.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
she
--
you're
suggestion
is
not
the
pocket
which
controls
the
disposition
of
the
problem
in
this
case
but
that
in
view
of
hawkins
their
would
be
practical
difficulties
in
trying
husband
and
wife
together
as
co-conspirators,
is
that
it?
