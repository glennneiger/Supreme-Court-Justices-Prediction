this,
i
--
i
think
your
argument
--
i
thought
it
was
fairly
obvious
this
is
a
federal
prosecution.
it's
the
same
--
the
same
as
if
the
federal
--
federal
officials
had
--
had
employed
these
state
officials
to
do
this
job
in
effect
it
see
--
they're
getting
they're
--
they're
getting
the
benefits
of
an
illegal
state
action
that
would
be
illegal
by
our
federal
standards.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
that's
been
claimed
all
along.
i
--
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
--
was
irrelevant
because
this
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
evidence
is
being
used
by
federal
agencies
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
may
be
with
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
is
our
--
position,
mr.
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
were
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
your
briefs
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
under
the
mcnabb
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
you
reserved
the
decision
on
the
--
this
case,
right
now
didn't
we,
this
rios
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
rios
case,
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
before
you
leave
that
--
i'm
just
reading
evelyn's
book
on
the
criminal
prosecution
in
england.
on
page
82,
i
notice
he
says
as
of
the
british
law,
any
form
of
physical
restraint
is
an
arrest.
if
that
was
the
test
applied
here,
when
would
you
say
it
took
place?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
about
the
--
how
about
the
pulling
of
the
gun
on
the
cab
drawer?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
came
after
that
--
after
you
say
that
he
is
--
after
he
detained
--
after
he
said,
"you're
under
arrest",
or
after
he
decided
to
hold
him.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
of
course
the
testimony
of
the
taxi
driver
is
a
little
different,
i
think
as
given
on
the
page
8
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
this
testimony
of
this
taxi
driver
in
the
case
that
beckmann
had
his
revolver
gone
prior
to
the
time
that
you
say
he
got
out
of
the
cab.
justice
william
o.
douglas
on
page
23
he
says,
"he
approached
his
gun
in
one
hand
and
his
badge
in
the
other".
