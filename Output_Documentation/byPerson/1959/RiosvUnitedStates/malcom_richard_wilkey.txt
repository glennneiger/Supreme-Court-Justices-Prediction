mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
your
inquiry
as
to
at
anytime
in
the
record
that
the
petitioner
may
have
been
cut
off
in
his
seeking
to
introduce
evidence,
and
in
our
search
during
my
lunch
hour,
the
only
place
that
we
find
that
he
was
temporarily
even
cut
off
and
he
does
make
a
point
out
of
footnote
of
his
brief
is
on
page
60.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
petitioner's
brief.
yes,
there's
a
footnote
which
he
refers
to
this,
page
60
of
the
record,
officer
beckmann,
“have
you
ever
turned
over
evidence
in
a
narcotics
case
to
the
federal
officers
prior
to
the
arrest
in
this
case?”
the
court,
“what
is
the
materiality
of
that?”
now,
there
are
other
places
in
the
--
i
think
he
was,
i
say
temporarily
restricted
in
his
inquiry
at
that
point
but
there
are
--
there
are
other
places
in
the
record
where
he
went
back
to
that
same
subject
and
did
make
unrestricted
inquiry
on
page
70
and
on
page
83
particularly.
he
was
allowed
to
make
inquiry
in
regard
to
police
reports
in
the
--
any
possible
participation
or
collusion.
so,
he
--
he
actually
wasn't
cut
off
there.
and
furthermore,
i
think
in
response
to
question
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
petitioner's
counsel
stated
very
clearly,
there
was
no
participation
or
collusion
in
this
case.
now,
that
is
all
we've
been
able
to
find.
we
haven't
gone
through
the
entire
record.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
we've
done
the
best
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
--
we
could
at
the
time.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
thank
you.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
now,
after
having
detailed
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
we
believe
indicate
very
clearly
that
there
was
no
arrest
until
after
the
officer
saw
the
contraband
and
that
there
was
in
fact
no
search
and
seizure
in
the
sense
known
to
the
law
that
there
was
in
effect
abandoned
the
contraband
which
was
taken
by
the
officers.
i
want
to
come
to
the
applicable
law
particularly
the
henry
case
decided
in
november
1959
of
this
court.
now,
i
think
it
most
important
that
in
the
henry
case,
there
was
a
concession
by
the
government
in
the
trial
court
which
was
adhered
to
all
the
way
through
these
proceedings
in
this
court
that
there
was
an
arrest
when
the
agents
stopped
the
car
in
henry.
and
the
government
said,
and
it
was
noted
hereby
in
the
court's
opinion
that
we
were
not
arguing
in
henry
that
the
arrest
did
not
take
place
at
a
later
time.
we
adhered
to
the
concession,
and
that
we
would
argue
at
this
point
as
to
the
time
of
arrest
in
the
rios
case,
and
that
is
what
we
are
doing
now.
now,
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
too
relevant
in
all
cases
as
to
how
the
car
was
stopped
because
we
do
believe
that
there
is
a
right
to
halt
a
moving
vehicle
for
the
purpose
of
inquiry
even
though
there
is
no
arrest.
but
if
there
is
any
distinction
between
who
causes
the
car
to
be
stopped,
we
point
out
that
in
this
case,
rios,
the
car
was
halted
at
the
light
behind
other
cars
in
traffic
at
the
time
that
inquiry
was
first
inaugurated.
now,
mr.
--
the
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
douglas
in
henry
said,
when
the
officers
interrupted
the
two
men
and
restricted
their
liberty
of
movement,
the
arrest,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
was
complete.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
exactly,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
we
pointed
out
that
that
would
be
argued
later
in
the
rios
case
in
the
footnote.
so
we
think
that
on
the
standard,
even
enunciated
in
the
opinion
here
in
henry,
when
the
officers
interrupted
the
two
men
and
restricted
their
liberty
of
movement,
the
arrest
for
purposes
of
this,
the
henry
case,
was
complete.
but
here
there
was
no
restriction
of
movement
of
the
petitioner
until
after
he
had
dropped
the
contraband.
he
was
sitting
in
a
halted
car
and
the
officers
merely
came
up
to
the
car.
now,
the
court
further
stated
in
henry,
and
this
is
very
applicable
here
as
to
there
reasonableness
of
the
officers
actions.
the
police
must
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
particular
package
carried
by
the
citizens
is
contraband.
its
shape
and
design
might
at
times
be
adequate.
the
weight
of
it
and
the
manner
in
which
it
is
carried
might
at
times
be
enough.
now
we
submit
that
the
container
--
narcotics
in
rios
to
any
police
officer
conversely
with
the
narcotics
strategy
spelled
out
narcotics
by
its
shape
and
design
and
by
the
color
and
size.
the
officer
could
not
ignore
what
his
eyes
told
him
as
he
saw
the
narcotics
container
on
the
floor
of
the
cab.
now
in
the
henry
case,
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
justice
clark
in
which
mr.
chief
--
the
chief
justice
joined,
in
which
it
was
said
that
the
government
concession
that
the
stopping
constitute
an
arrest
was,
i'm
not
using
the
words
in
the
opinion
there,
but
in
effect
was
unnecessary
and
unwise
in
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
the
dissent
said
that
no
arrest
until
after
the
agents
found
other
facts
which
would
be
probable
cause.
here
we
say
that
on
both
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
in
henry
and
on
the
dissent,
here
clearly
that
mere
inquiry
an
identification
by
an
officer
as
to
who
he
is,
in
nowise
constitutes
an
arrest
and
therefore
that
the
arrest
could
not
have
taken
place
until
after
the
contraband
was
visible
and
meant
to
that
police
officer
of
what
it
really
was.
now,
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
there
is
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
it's
not
clear.
and
the
reason
it's
not
clear,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
because
everything
took
place
in
the
period
of
one
minute
and
the
cab
driver
was
obviously
nervous
and
it
is
only
his
evidence
which
indicates
in
any
way
that
the
officer
drew
his
gun
until
after
the
man
was
outside
of
the
cab
and
the
officer
had
his
hands
on
him
and
he
was
resisting
arrest.
all
of
the
other
evidence,
the
testimony
of
the
two
police
officers,
beckmann
and
grace
showed
that
the
officer
had
a
badge
in
his
left
hand
and
a
flashlight
in
the
right
until
such
a
point
after
the
contraband
was
identified.
now,
to
sum
up
on
the
arrest,
we
say
that
there
was
a
right
to
inquire
of
the
petition
in
the
cab.
no
arrest
was
made
or
intended
until
after
the
officers
saw
a
package
which
in
all
probability
contained
narcotics,
and
at
this
seeing
the
package
plus
the
circumstances
leading
up
to
the
inquiry
did
constitute
probable
cause
for
an
arrest,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
there
was
a
seizure
in
the
sense
known
to
the
law,
a
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
seizure
too.
now,
on
the
second
point
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
after
petitioner
alighted
from
the
cab,
if
that
would
be
the
test
here,
after
petitioner
alighted
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
i
don't
think
the
gun
was
pulled
and
i
don't
think
that
the
facts
established
that
it
was
pulled
until
after
the
officer
was
engaged
in
the
struggle
with
the
man
and
that
that
was
the
reason
the
gun
was
pulled.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
yes.
it
came
at
the
time
that
he
was
grabbing
hold
of
the
man
and
the
man
was
obviously
resisting
and
pulling
away.
now,
in
all
of
those
things
happened
rapid
fast,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
there
was
no
pulling
of
the
gun
until
after
the
petitioner
alighted
from
the
cab.
there
was
no
necessity
of
it.
the
officer
has
testified
that
he
identified
himself
and
then
the
narcotics
were
dropped
and
after
he
saw
the
narcotics
dropped,
he
reached
for
the
door
and
the
petitioner
likewise
started
to
get
out.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
yes,
it
does.
the
taxi
--
i
can
only
say
that
i
think
clearly
it
was
impossible
for
the
taxi
cab
driver
to
be
right
on
that,
that
while
he
may
have
been
try
to
recall
things
as
best
he
could,
that
it
was
impossible
on
the
other
admitted
and
established
facts
as
to
what
he
had
in
his
two
hands
a
flashlight
and
a
badge.
and
that
on
page
23
of
the
record
in
the
case,
the
petitioner's
counsel
admitted
that
the
officer
did
not
have
the
gun
in
his
hands
when
he
approached
the
cab
and
i
think
on
all
the
facts
that
that's
true
and
i
think
that
certainly
the
district
and
all
the
evidence
before
it
when
it
heard
the
testimony
of
the
people.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
at
the
time
he
approached
the
cab,
i
believed
that's
true
on
the
page
23.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
yes
that's
what
he
said,
and
then
if
you
will
your
honor
look
at
what
the
court
said
correcting
me
with
which
petitioner's
counsel
agreed.
now
logically,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
the
seizure
here
and
the
admission
of
evidence
does
not
depend
upon
actually
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest,
because
the
evidence
here
was
contraband
abandoned
in
a
public
cab
and
its
seizure
did
not
depend
on
establishing
the
arrest
or
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
now
on
that,
we
would
rely
on
mr.
justice
holmes'
opinion
in
the
hester
case
cited
in
our
brief.
in
the
hester
case,
it
was
a
prohibition
--
a
liquor
case,
there
the
prohibition
agents
in
consequence
of
information,
and
by
the
way
the
record
shows
at
page
21
of
the
record
in
that
case
that
the
only
testimony
as
to
information
was
one
of
the
agent
says,
as
the
result
of
information,
they
grove
to
the
vicinity
of
hester's
house.
they
went
there
and
they
concealed
themselves
and
they
saw
hester
come
out
of
the
house
and
hand
another
man
a
bottle.
there
was
an
alarm
given
to
somebody
on
the
premises.
hester
took
a
gallon
jug
from
an
automobile
standing
nearby
and
both
men
ran
away.
one
of
the
officers
pursued
and
fired
a
pistol.
hester
dropped
the
jug
and
the
other
man
threw
away
the
bottle.
they
were
found
on
retrieving
by
the
officers
to
contain
moonshine.
the
officers
had
no
warrant
for
search
or
for
arrest
when
they
were
on
the
premises
of
hester.
this
court
through
mr.
justice
holmes
in
holding
the
evidence
admissible
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
whether
the
action
of
the
officers
which
caused
hester
to
betray
himself
was
legal
saying
at
page
58
of
the
opinion.
it
is
obvious
that
even
if
there
had
been
a
trespass,
the
above
testimony
was
not
obtained
by
an
illegal
search
or
seizure.
the
defendants
own
acts
and
those
of
his
associates
disclosed
the
jug,
the
jar,
and
the
bottle.
and
there
was
no
seizure
in
the
sense
of
the
law
when
the
officers
examined
the
contents
of
each
after
it
had
been
abandoned.
now
here,
you'll
have
in
the
hester
case
the
officers
being
on
the
premises
without
warrant,
observation
a
chase
in
the
pursuit
in
which
a
pistol
was
fired
and
the
moonshine
was
dropped.
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
an
abandonment
of
contraband
and
there
was
no
search
and
seizure
which
depended
on
the
legality
of
any
warrant
or
depended
on
the
legality
of
any
arrest.
i
think
that
we
can
also
draw
an
analogy
from
the
abel
case
decided
yesterday
in
which
items
six
and
seven,
which
were
left
in
the
hotel
room
by
abel,
were
then
picked
up
by
the
fbi
after
abel
had
been
taken
away.
abel,
as
i
remember
the
facts,
had
rented
that
hotel
room
until
later
in
the
day
but
when
he
went
with
the
agents,
while
they
paid
his
bill
with
the
desk
and
the
hotel
room
was
then
reverted
to
the
inn
keeper.
and
so
there
--
the
--
i
think
the
court
held
in
abel
that
the
admissibility
of
both
items
six
and
seven
found
by
the
agents
after
the
arrest
taken
place,
did
not
in
anyway
depend
upon
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
i
--
while
officer
beckmann
was
in
pursuit
and
it
lasted
for
a
period
of
over
two
blocks
of
the
petitioner,
the
second
officer
leap
from
the
cab.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
the
policewoman
picked
it
up,
yes.
beckmann
says
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
i
suppose
so,
i
suppose
that
similar
to
abel
that
rios
intended
to
reserve
that
cab
until
he
reached
his
destination,
but
other
events
intervened,
and
abel
intended
to
reserve
that
room
until
i
think
the
afternoon
and
the
search
i
believe
or
the
examination
by
the
fbi
was
made
before
that
time
expired
but
abel
had
left
the
premises
and
he
had
abandoned
what
was
there.
i
believed
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
abel
case.
that
same
principle
was
applied
in
1954
in
the
lee
case
from
the
district
of
columbia
where
officers
were
interrogating
two
people
in
a
car
and
asked
them
to
get
out
of
the
car.
they
got
out
and
in
so
doing
they
dropped
the
stolen
jewelry
in
the
gutters
and
it
was
held
there
on
the
authority
of
the
hester
case
that
there
was
no
search
and
seizure
as
known
to
the
law.
now
then
i
want
to
get
to
an
examination
--
by
the
way
the
trial
court,
the
district
court
rested
his
determination
on
both
the
abandonment
of
the
contraband
theory
and
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
arrest
until
after
the
petitioner
alighted
from
the
cab
or
after
the
discovery
of
the
contraband
which
in
his
view
constituted
probable
cause.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
i
think
that
the
key
time
is
the
discovery
of
the
contraband,
not
the
time
the
petitioner
alighted
from
the
cab
whenever
it
is,
but
i
think
that
was
subdued.
now
i
want
to
get
to
the
third
point
which
involves
as
a
possible
adoption
of
this
court,
the
rule
of
exclusion
on
the
federal
courts
as
to
evidence
which
is
found
by
state
officers.
i
want
to
say
at
the
outset
that
as
i
read
the
precedents
involving
this
rule
that's
applied
to
federal
officers.
weeks,
center,
burdeau
versus
mcdowell,
which
is
not
federal
officers
neither
was
center,
but
the
weeks
rule
as
--
that
has
involved
federal
officers
for
the
good
reason
of
the
discipline
of
federal
officers
and
it
was
felt
that
the
exclusionary
rule
what
implement
the
command
of
the
fourth
amendment
not
necessarily
being
required
by
the
fourth
amendment,
but
it
would
implement
the
fourth
amendment
and
it
would
serve
as
a
deterrent
and
it
would
be
as
applied
to
federal
officers,
be
effective
in
enforcing
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
reason
for
the
exclusionary
rule
of
weeks
as
applied
to
federal
officers
does
not
apply,
does
--
does
not
follow
where
state
officers
or
private
individuals
are
concerned.
even
in
the
federal
courts,
this
exclusionary
rule
has
not
been
completely
effective
as
witness
the
cases
coming
before
this
court
and
the
other
courts.
and
i
think
that
this
court
and
the
other
courts
can
note
that
there
are
significant
differences
perhaps
among
the
federal
agencies
varying
with
their
training
as
pre
to
core
their
methods
of
recruitment.
there
are
many
factors
involved
in
making
the
exclusionary
rule
work,
which
exclusion
in
court
is
only
one,
but
it
does
have
a
disciplinary
effect
on
federal
officers
and
there
is
a
certain
rough
justice
where
the
federal
government
is
both
the
prosecutor
and
the
federal
officers
are
the
ones
who
participate
in
the
seizure
in
making
the
real
effect
to
excluding
the
evidence.
they
are,
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
phrase
of
yesterday,
in
the
same
household,
and
so
it
does
have
that
effect.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
i
think
that,
that
is
the
reason
which
has
been
articulated
in
the
opinions
of
the
court
as
to
the
basis
of
the
rule,
mr.
justice
black.
i
am
aware
that
in
dissenting
opinions
as
mr.
justice
holmes
and
brandeis
that
there
has
been
another
rule
--
another
reason
that
is
to
say
that
the
government
should
have
no
part
of
and
should
not
adopt
or
ratify
or
have
the
benefit
of
in
a
dirty
business.
but
it
is
our
position
that
the
real
reason
for
it
is
one
of
effectiveness,
and
that
we
must
distinguish
between
the
physical
evidence
itself
and
the
actions
of
people
over
whom
the
government
has
no
control
whatever
in
obtaining
the
evidence.
the
evidence
is
probative
trustworthy.
it's
not
the
federal
officers
who
are
bringing
the
prosecution.
it
is
the
organized
society
itself.
and
there
has
to
be,
as
many
times
said
in
the
court,
weighing
and
the
balancing
of
the
laws
in
law
enforcement
by
the
exclusion
and
the
gain
in
the
enforcing
the
constitutional
mandate
and
where
the
officers
are
federal
or
there's
federal
participation
and
there's
force
on
degree
of
control,
it
is
believed
that
that
is
effective.
but
i
think
that
while
there
is
another
reason
for
it,
that
other
reason
has
not
been
adopted
by
the
court,
and
in
fact
i
believe
impliedly,
it
was
rejected
in
the
dissent,
i
think
rejected
in
the
dissents
where
the
dissenters
urged
it
and
it
was
not
applied
in
wolf
versus
colorado
where
it
was
left
to
the
states
to
make
their
own
rules
and
their
own
choices.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
well,
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice
black,
a
confession
in
itself
that
has
been
pressured
is
not
trustworthy.
and
the
second
good
ground
is
that
it
shocks
and
offense
our
conscience
and
sensibilities
to
admit
that.
i
think
that
coerced
confessions
throughout
the
law
had
stood
on
a
different
ground
from
the
question
of
illegal
search
and
seizures.
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
there
is
a
constitutional
mandate
and
the
question
has
always
been
and
before
this
court
as
to
how
best
to
implement
the
constitutional
mandate.
in
weeks
it
said
we
will
exclude
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
boyd
involved
--
boyd
actually
involved
the
fifth
amendment
where
there
was
a
compelled
confession
in
effect
by
the
compelled
production
of
records
and
the
court
said
that
they
would
not
count
on
outset.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
yes.
i
would
not
deny
that
there
is
some
similarity,
but
i
think
that
the
basic
reason
in
each
case
is
different.
the
basic
reason
for
excluding
a
coerced
confession
is
it's
untrustworthy.
secondly
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
well,
i
won't
put
them
one
and
two
but
that's
a
primary
reason
and
the
other
is,
the
other
reason
is
that
--
that
is
so
--
offends
our
sensibilities
so
that
we
will
not
tolerate
from
any
source
as
the
rochin
case
in
california,
i
think
that
stands
on
that
ground.
but
on
the
fourth
amendment,
i
think
that
courts
have
been
primarily
concerned
in
the
majority
opinions
of
the
court.
the
decisions
of
the
court
have
been
concerned
with
the
effectiveness
as
a
sanction.
now,
i
submit
that
the
reason
--
that
the
reason
of
a
sanction
and
the
reason
about
the
certain
rough
justice
in
knocking
out
the
federal
government's
evidence
if
the
federal
government
was
responsible
for
the
wrong,
and
remember
mr.
justice
holmes
in
silverthorne
spoke
of
the
government's
own
wrong,
we
don't
have
that
here.
those
--
both
those
reasons
breakdown
where
state
officers
are
concerned.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
i
don't
think
that
it
is
wrongful
to
use
evidence
illegally
obtained,
i
think
it
is
wrongful
illegally
to
obtain
evidence,
and
i
think
there's
vast
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
well,
i
think
there
are
two
things.
first
of
all,
here
we're
dealing
with
state
officers
and
i
think
that
the
majority
of
the
court
--
the
court
has
held
that
the
restriction
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
state
officers
is
not
exactly
the
same
as
the
restriction
on
the
fourth,
the
fourth
amendment
on
federal,
that's
one
point
on
the
constitutional
command
itself.
and
the
second
point
is
that
there
is
a
choice
of
the
method
of
enforcing
the
constitutional
command,
and
that
is
what
i
want
to
argue
before
the
court
now
that
the
court
should
not
adopt
a
method
of
an
exclusionary
rule
which
everyone
knows
results
in
otherwise
guilty
people
going
free
unless
there
is
another
benefit
to
society,
in
other
words,
that
the
rule
of
exclusion
would
be
effective
and
improve
the
due
administration
with
the
enforcement
of
the
law.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
that's
entirely
correct
in
support
of
our
position
i
believe,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
of
course,
the
different
states
after
thorough
consideration
of
the
weeks
rule
or
the
rule
of
exclusion
some
have
adopted
and
some
have
not
and
it
seems
that
that
is
one
that
should
be
left
to
them
and
is.
and
that
the
federal
courts
cannot
concern
themselves
with
the
vagaries
of
either
state
law,
the
discipline
of
state
officers,
or
even
the
actions
of
private
individuals.
the
petitioner
in
elkins
differs
from
the
petitioner
in
rios.
the
petitioner
in
elkins
will
ask
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
which
will
exclude
all
evidence
wrongfully
obtained
whether
obtained
by
state
officers
or
private
individuals.
now
that
not
only
would
put
the
federal
courts
at
the
mercy
of
every
state
local
policemen
and
magistrate
but
also
every
private
detective
throughout
the
country.
i
--
petitioner
in
elkins
stated
very
frankly
that
that
was
his
position
and
that
to
do
--
to
adopt
such
a
rule,
the
court
would
have
to
overrule
the
precedents
of
weeks,
center
and
burdeau
versus
mcdowell.
and
in
regard
to
the
precedent
on
this,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
in
center,
the
action
taken
wrongfully
i
believe
was
state
officers
but
in
saying
that
that
was
not
excluded
the
court
cited
burdeau
versus
mcdowell,
thus
throwing
state
officers
into
the
category
of
private
individuals
over
along
the
federal
government
has
no
control.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
well,
i
don't
know
if
i'll
deal
adequately
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
won't
--
i
might
as
well
turn
to
that
now.
it
seemed
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
we
may
not
in
rios,
mr.
justice
black,
but
we
did
in
elkins
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
--
and
i
argued
--
i
mentioned
that
if
in
the
argument
in
elkins,
yes.
feldman
helps
us
as
far
as
the
rationale
of
not
allowing
federal
justice
to
be
determined
by
state
action
of
either
laws
or
official
over
whom
the
government
has
no
control
whenever
.it
helps
us
in
that
regard.
it's
analogous.
and
i
think
i
used
that
in
argument
along
with
the
abbate
opinion
--
argument.
it
seems
to
me
that
aside
from
the
disciplinary
reason
for
the
exclusionary
rule
as
a
flag
to
federal
officers
there
are
--
all
of
the
other
arguments
the
non-constitutional
argument
of
the
dissenters,
mr.
justice
brandeis
and
holmes,
those
--
that
this
is
dirty
business
that
the
courts
must
remain
pure
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
--
that
all
of
those
arguments
are
equally
valid
as
was
urged
in
the
burdeau
case,
whether
a
private
individual
is
involved
or
whether
state
officers
are
involved.
and
the
possibilities
of
connivance,
collusion,
vast
irregularities
in
the
administration
of
federal
justice
are
just
enormous
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
that
are
opened
up
by
seeing
that
the
federal
court,
in
some
way,
is
responsible
for
the
actions
of
private
individuals,
private
detective
agencies,
local
constables,
local
magistrates
who
air
on
the
law
as
to
what
constitutes
a
valid
warrant.
all
of
those
things
are
equally
valid
arguments
for
private
exclusion
no
matter
who
is
guilty
of
the
wrong.
and
that
federal
justice
simply
cannot
be
dependent
upon
those
things.
and
i
think
that
for
a
court
to
hold
that
to
adopt
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
these
two
cases
would
be
to
overrule
all
the
precedent
of
weeks
and
center
and
burdeau
versus
mcdowell
and
also
to
overrule
the
rationale
of
wolf
itself.
the
--
i
also
want
to
say
that
the
--
it
seems
to
me
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
federal
court
should
not
differ
between
the
states
as
to
whether
the
states
has
an
exclusionary
rule
or
not,
that
we
must
have
the
same
standard
in
(voice
overlap).
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
as
a
matter
of
policy,
yes.
now
it
seems
that
in
considering
the
application
of
this
exclusionary
rule
there
you
got
assume
two
set
different
situations.
take
the
case
of
an
intentional
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
well,
if
it's
a
warrant
situation,
here
you
have
a
state
magistrate
passing
on
it.
the
educational
requirements
of
state
magistrates
vary
and
you
have
irregular
results,
the
country
over
and
you
have
to
postulate
if
you
have
an
intentional
violation.
you
have
to
postulate
either
the
ignorance
or
connivance
of
state
magistrate
in
obtaining
the
testimony.
then
if
you
postulate
an
intentional
violation
in
a
no
warrant
situation,
here
you
must
have
in
a
split
second
operation
like
the
seizure
in
rios.
you
must
have
a
policeman
making
a
careful
analysis
of
the
situation
and
saying
to
himself
that
under
california
law,
i
couldn't
get
it
in
the
state
court
but
i
can
get
it
in
in
the
federal
court
and
so,
i'll
grab
it
and
finally
have
a
federal
prosecution.
now
those
things
just
don't
take
place.
so
i
think
that
on
the
practicalities
of
the
thing
that
an
exclusionary
rule
in
the
feral
court
would
be
ineffective
if
you
assume
an
intentional
violation
whether
it's
a
warrant
or
not
a
warrant.
now,
if
you
assumed
an
unintentional
violation,
you
make
federal
justice
dependent
on
the
errors
not
only
of
every
local
police
officer
but
also
on
the
legal
wisdom
of
the
local
magistrate
throughout
the
country
when
seeking
a
warrant.
now
if
--
of
course
intentional
violation
assumes
no
fault
at
anytime,
whatever
is
using
this
evidence
than
the
federal
court.
and
so,
it
seemed
in
a
practical
way.
if
the
discipline
of
the
state
exclusionary
rule
itself,
as
they
have
in
california,
will
not
improve
the
discipline
of
state
police,
a
federal
exclusionary
rule
will
have
no
effect
--
further
effect
whatever.
take
this
case
of
rios
for
example.
california
has
a
rule
of
exclusion.
they
adopted
it
in
the
cahan
case.
now,
would
officer
beckmann
had
acted
differently
here
if
he
had
been
aware
that
the
federal
courts
would
have
an
exclusionary
rule
like
california.
i
submit
that
no
hours
of
training
time
or
instruction
for
officer
beckmann
or
any
other
state
officers
would
be
aided
by
the
fact
that
the
state
--
that
the
federal
court
also
have
an
exclusionary
rule
in
regard
to
the
actions
of
state
officers.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
absolutely
nothing.
the
record
i
think
shows
that
he
acted
in
good
faith
and
acted
as
any
trained
police
officer
under
the
circumstances
would
have
acted.
i
can't
conceive
of
him
acting
differently.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
well
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
your
point
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
you
pointed
out
much
more
adequately
than
i
could.
the
distinction
between
that
particular
--
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
and
the
rule
laid
down
there
and
the
facts
of
the
rios
and
elkins
case,
where
in
rios
it
is
contraband
could
never
be
lawfully
posses
by
any
private
individual
and
in
elkins
where
the
tapes
were
instruments
of
crime,
the
fruits
of
crime
and
then
place
in
sort
judicial
limbo
and
would
not
be
returned
to
their
owner.
that
is
a
far
different
situation
from
the
private
papers
involved
in
the
burdeau
case,
and
the
rule
might
conceivably
be
different
but
here
in
rios
and
elkins
we're
confronted
with
the
actions
of
state
officers
in
one
case
with
the
warrant
and
another
case
acting
on
the
fact
situation
that
would
impel
i
think,
any
officer
to
act
the
same
way.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
yes
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
we're
advocating
first
your
honor
that
in
this
case
and
in
elkins,
certainly
the
facts
show
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
--
the
silver
platter
doctrine
should
be
upheld
and
no
exclusionary
rule
should
be
adopted
and
then
in
mentioning
those
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
right.
and
we
mentioned
--
we
made
that
argument,
that
alternative
argument
to
show
the
court
that
it's
not
confronted
with
hard
and
fast
alternatives
here
and
that
as
in
the
burdeau
case,
as
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
are
intermediary
positions
and
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
adopt
the
weeks,
an
iron
clad
weeks
rule
and
it
doesn't
have
to
--
in
this
case
adopt
the
silver
platter
rule
for
this,
all
other
cases,
that
there
is
a
intermediary
position
which
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
similar
to
that
in
the
burdeau
case.
we
are
here
primarily
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
rios,
there
was
a
lawful
taking
of
the
contraband
that
there
was
no
arrest
until
such
time
as
the
contraband
had
been
identified
and
therefore
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
and
then
if
--
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
we
would
urge
that
it
would
be
very
unwise
to
adopt
the
rigid
exclusionary
rule
of
the
type
of
weeks
and
we
pointed
out
the
alternative
to
show
that
there
is
more
than
one
alternative
before
the
court
on
which
i
can
sustain
each
of
these
convictions.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
right.
the
wolf
versus
colorado
position,
that's
our
primary
position.
and
for
the
reason
of
this,
the
effectiveness
of
it
--
i
--
i
think
about
the
position
of
state
officers,
there's
no
incentive
for
them
to
conform
to
a
federal
rule
any
more
than
they
have
for
their
own
state
rule.
the
training
orientation
of
state
officers
both
enforcement
and
judicial
towards
state
law,
what
is
a
magistrate
going
to
do
if
the
--
this
court
should
adopt
the
exclusionary
rule
of
weeks
as
applied
to
state
officers.
he's
going
probably
to
do
the
same
thing
he
does
now
lay
that
affidavit
and
that
warrant
beside
his
code,
his
state
code
and
he
has
formed
both
because
are
--
it
is
assumed
in
these
cases
that
come
up
that
there
is
no
federal
participation
and
there
is
only
an
intent
for
a
state
prosecution.
and
so
that's
all
the
law
enforcement
officers
and
the
magistrate
is
going
to
be
concerned
with.
then
think
of
the
training
of
local
police.
some
have
none
whatever.
think
of
the
caliber
men
that
are
recruited
that
varies
widely.
think
of
the
legal
acumen
of
the
local
magistrates,
because
for
instance
in
elkins,
this
was
not
only
the
error
of
a
deputy
sherif,
it
was
the
error
of
the
district
attorney
if
it
wasn't
error
of
his
chief
assistant
and
of
the
magistrate
on
thursday
night
reversed
on
monday
morning.
so
an
adoption
of
the
weeks
rule
would
make
federal
justice
dependent
on
all
these
varying
factors
and
would
not
be
effective
in
improving
the
training
of
state
officers
and
making
the
compliance
with
the
constitutional
standards
more
of
a
reality.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
rest
the
government's
case
here.
mr.
malcom
richard
wilkey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
