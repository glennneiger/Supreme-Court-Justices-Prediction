mr.
wilkey,
does
not
this
knocking
off
dispute
about
detail
of
this
nature
get
down
to
whether
or
not
it
was
resolved
by
findings
made
by
the
trial
judge
as
shown
at
the
101
page
of
the
record?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
why
i
asked
the
question
(inaudible).
is
the
running
policeman
or
basis
upon
which
we
here
can
determine
facts
that
are
in
controversy
in
detail
and
that
have
been
resolved.
there's
some
reason
why
we
are
not
bound
by
the
findings
made
below.
