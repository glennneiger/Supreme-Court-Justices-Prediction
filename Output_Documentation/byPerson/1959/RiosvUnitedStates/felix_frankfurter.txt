justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
also
placed
after
your
supreme
court
decided
the
cahan
case,
i
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
they
said
it
was
on
--
it
might
make
a
greater
question
of
res
judicata
say
gone
on
the
ground
of
--
a
consistent
ground
of
federal
--
a
violation
of
a
federal
law
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
see
how
reading
that
page
mr.
grossman
i
can
--
i
can
find
anything
on
which
to
hang
that
he
decided
the
federal
--
that
he
adjudicated
the
federal
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
it's
more
than
--
it's
less
than
ambiguous
because
he
expresses
his
view
of
great
freedom
in
preferring
justice
carter's
well-known
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree,
mr.
grossman,
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
in
saying
the
silver
platter
doctrine
claims
that
it's
not
very
colloquy
to
describe
what
it
is,
presupposes
illegalities.
otherwise,
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
draw
any
inference
from
that.
i
don't
draw
conclusions.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
isn't
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
is
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
applied
in
any
of
the
cases
in
which
--
in
which
it
was
--
in
which
this
court
has
been
dealing
is
the
effect
upon
the
use
of
materials,
evidentiary
materials
obtained
under
questionable
circumstances
and
more
particularly
illegalities
by
state
officers
who
precluded
submission
to
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
question.
all
i'm
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
one
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
your
--
the
problem
--
the
first
thing
that
you
put
presupposes
that
the
--
the
fourth
amendment
is
binding
upon
state
agencies
in
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
--
that
answers
the
--
all
the
problems
we
have
had.
but
when
you
say
that
at
least
the
assumption
must
be
when
you
say
you
must
inquire
whether
what
state
officials
did
would
be
if
done
by
federal
officials
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
you
certainly
imply
that
the
restriction
of
conduct
upon
the
police
constituting
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
condemned
by
the
fourth
--
fourth
amendment
is
a
restriction
upon
state
officials.
is
that
right?
it
must
be
so
otherwise
what's
its
relevance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
wolf
case
has
decided
the
contrary.
you
may
ask
this
court
to
overrule
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
you
can
say
it
when
most
of
the
states
of
the
union
say
the
other
thing,
and
this
court
has
said
that
their
rules
of
law
are
not
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
don't
understand.
i
don't
understand
your
argument
without
taking
that
attack
but
i
can
understand
that
kind
of
legal
goulash.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
i
follow
you.
i
follow
all
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
understanding
it,
i
think,
but
what
i
--
are
you
intervening
when
you
suggested
we're
going
to
embark
upon
an
inquiry
whether
the
search
and
seizure
by
the
two
police
--
by
the
policeman
and
the
policewoman
constituted
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
--
of
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
under
federal
law.
and
--
and
i
suggested
that
that
is
--
mixing
up
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
grossman,
i
--
i
--
i'm
very
eager
to
understand
and
follow
your
argument
with
understanding,
am
i
right
in
saying
that
the
last
that
you
--
the
last
--
what
you've
said
during
the
last
few
minutes
in
analyzing
and
critically
commenting
upon
the
conduct
on
beckmann
and
grace,
it's
precisely
the
argument
you
would
make
if
this
had
been
a
federal
prosecution
and
beckmann
and
grace
had
been
fbi
agents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
about
that?
precisely,
you
would
make
that
argument
if
this
were
beckmann
and
grace
had
been
narcotic
agents,
let
me
say,
and
that
had
done
what
they
had
done,
what
beckmann
and
grace
did,
and
they'd
made
the
arrest
and
they
had
followed
the
prosecution
in
federal
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
i
go
back
to
my
question,
that
the
assumption
in
the
light
of
validity
of
that
argument
is
that
the
limitations
upon
arresting
power
and
searching
power,
a
federal
enforcing
authority,
a
federal
law
officer,
by
virtue
of
the
fourth
amendment,
bind
the
states
and
therefore
the
state's
officials.
that
must
be
the
implication
otherwise
i
don't
see
the
relevance
of
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
--
may
be
so
but
although
i
want
to
know
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
dealing
with
and
not
have
my
mind
confuse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
federal
court
didn't
make
any
search
and
seizure.
the
federal
court
comes
into
play
because
evidence
was
admitted
which,
under
your
contention,
was
illegally
obtained
by
state
officials
and
then
given
to
the
thrust
of
the
united
states
prosecutors.
i'm
not
--
i
--
all
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
have
an
analysis
that
i
can
understand.
i
can
understand
you're
saying
the
whole
case
should
be
overruled.
and
i
can
understand
your
saying
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
state.
i
can
understand
those
propositions,
but
i
can't
understand
arguing
and
not
tenably
saying
we
think
wolf
was
wrong.
we
think
the
fourth
amendment
also
applies
to
the
state
and
therefore
its
officials.
not
doing
that,
accepting
the
wolf
case,
and
going
on
and
arguing
as
though
this
conduct
was
by
federal
officials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
started
out
your
argument
by
saying
quite
candidly
in
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
controversy
that
there
was
any
collusion
or
stimulation
or
whatever
word
you
used,
any
kind
of
relationship
whereby
federal
officials
made
use
of
state
authorities
and
to
say
it's
all
the
same
whether
federal
people
did
it
or
didn't
it,
is
to
confound
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
as
a
matter
--
in
fact
the
result
maybe
the
same.
but
i'd
like
to
add
some
theories
on
the
basis
for
understanding
the
claim
that
you
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
of
that
--
followed
what
they
did
in
getting
the
incriminating
materials,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
true
that
the
incriminating
materials
were
--
were
brought
by
them
without
any
knowledge
or
collusion
with
stimulation
through
the
federal
officials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
or
is
it
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
but
will
you
please
answer
my
question
whether
there
was
any
participation,
stimulations,
suggestions,
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
federal
authorities
when
beckmann
in
the
--
regarding
the
circumstances
by
which
beckmann
and
grace
stopped
the
cab,
made
a
disclosure
of
their
identity,
arrested
these
people
and
took
the
materials.
was
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
i'm
now
asking
you
whether
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
argument,
but
will
you
please
answer
me
whether
there
was
any
participation,
any
sharing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
way
in
which
these
materials
were
obtained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
arguing
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
always
clear
whether
there's
participation
or
not
and
that
is
a
contested
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
might
be
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
your
qualifications
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
implies
that
under
one
set
of
circumstances,
which
i
think
was
what
the
brandeis
dissent
indicated,
under
one
set
of
circumstances,
you
would
exclude
and
another
set
of
circumstances,
you
would
not
exclude
but
would
not
turn
it
merely
on
whether
or
not
there
was
illegality
on
the
part
of
state
officers.
you
said
just
now
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
any
--
in
the
other
case,
there
was
an
argument
that
they
were
horrendous,
that
they
were
really
shocking
circumstances,
mr.
wiener
said.
are
there
any
particular
aggravating
circumstances
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mand
i
can
understand
the
flat
rule
that
any
--
any
evidence
obtained
illegally
by
state
enforcing
officers,
then
put
at
the
disposal
of
federal
authorities,
is
to
be
excluded
in
the
federal
courts.
i
can
understand
that,
but
my
inquiry
was
aroused
by
your
qualification
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
wouldn't
be
casuistic
to
suggest
that
a
search
made
on
the
basis
of
a
warrantless
warrant,
an
illegal,
unsupportable
warrant
is
worse
than
an
officer
doing
it
on
his
own,
because
you
cloak
yourself
with
legal
authority
and
make
yourself
the
agent
of
judicial
authorization
when
in
fact
you
haven't
got
it.
so
then
one
might
say
that's
worse
than
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
taking
out
the
right
to
seize.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
the
difficulties
of
drawing
these
lines.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
may
i
suggest
that
hardly
any
rule
of
evidence
is
without
qualification,
whether
the
hearsay
rule
or
the
best
evidence
rule
or
the
etcetera,
etcetera.
so
that
what
you
call
a
simple
rule
of
evidence
has
not
--
it's
analog
in
the
domain
of
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
a
simple
rule
doesn't
mean
that
the
--
be
--
it
has
to
be
unqualified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
difficulty
is
that
we've
got
a
state
court
that
said
something
else,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
to
that
consideration,
mr.
wilkey,
when
we
start
to
take
into
account
i
think
in
dealing
with
these
considerations
one
that
the
court
should
be
pure,
and
i
mean
this,
and
two
that
the
enforcement
of
law
for
society
benefit
should
be
affective
without
hampering
something
very
offensive,
that
among
the
50
states,
there
are
various
standards
both
in
statute
law
and
in
decision
of
law
as
to
what
constitutes
an
illegality
in
an
arrest
or
in
a
search,
which
that
this
court
decided
yesterday
that
is
a
merely
because
warrant
is
based
on
hearsay
doesn't
render
it
illegal
and
insufficient
under
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
state
may
hae
a
much
higher
standard
than
that,
ultimate
constitutional
standard
are
not
the
last
word
of
morality
or
delicacy
of
thinking,
they
are
rather
under
minimize.
and
so
you
may
have
state
declaring
warrants
illegal
way
above
the
standard
that
would
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment,
and
it
wouldn't
have
a
general
exclusionary
rule
of
having
evidence
obtained
through
illegal
steps
by
way
of
search
or
arrest
may
invalidate
the
introduction
or
render
inadmissible
the
introduction
of
evidence
which
the
federal
court
themselves
in
enforcing
the
federal
constitution
would
not
have
been
illegal.
there
are
considerations
on
both
sides
when
you
deal
with
such
diversities
of
standards
and
requirements
in
law
enforcement,
as
under
our
system
of
the
distribution
of
political
powers
is
presented
as
between
the
50
states
in
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
ordinary
to
deal
at
length
--
to
deal
adequately
with
the
proposed
rule
in
the
dissent
of
burdeau
against
mcdowell,
namely,
to
make
it
a
rule
not
of
constitutional
prohibition
but
of
standard
of
evidence
applicable
to
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
deal
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
officer
beckmann
didn't
--
that
he
have
the
right
to
do,
a
legal
right
to
do
what
he
did,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that's
inclusive.
you
suggest
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
the
burdeau
case
in
which
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
what
he
said
about
shocking
in
common
indecency
because
that
was
a
case
of
theft
of
outright
thievery
and
the
stolen
goods
being
handed
over
to
a
special
assistant
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
by
him
to
be
used
in
the
fourth
coming
trial,
and
the
proceeding
was
not
the
admissibility
but
as
you
know
the
proceeding
to
make
defense,
there
he
was
defense
he
was
a
high
officer,
a
high
legal
officer
of
the
federal
government.
the
recipient
had
concededly
stolen
goods
and
that
the
issue
was
to
return
of
those
stolen
goods
to
the
true
owner.
and
the
defense
was
that
we
want
to
keep
this
because
we
want
to
use
them
in
the
trial.
it
was
in
that
setting
--
that
justice
holmes
and
justice
brandeis
sent
it
and
was
shock
and
said
this
ought
to
be
returned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
an
interesting
fact
that
the
terms
of
the
dissent
are
not
very
generally
pertained
to
this
particular
case.
the
thing
starts
out
to
have
his
private
property
stolen,
in
fact
the
truck
was
suspended.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
thinking
that
they
didn't
mean
that's
specifically
done
with
the
general
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
suggesting
is
he
would
have
consciously
clouding
the
rule
of
the
state
the
conroe
which
had
been
announced
and
pronounced
only
years
three
before.
he
didn't
care
about
violating
the
law
of
the
state
but
he
could
then
drove
to
the
federal
court
and
has
immunity,
is
that
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
implied
because
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
addicted
in
illegal
use?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
he
thinks
what
he's
doing
was
legal
and
get
the
reconstructive
interpretation
that
there
was
some
legal
warrant
showed
at
the
requirements,
because
concededly
if
this
--
i
don't
--
while
that
examined
the
record,
he
did
not
recite
this
notion
that
what
he
did
here
wasn't
according
to
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
thought
he
had
a
probable
cause
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
trying
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
--
that
isn't
the
suggestion
that
i
want
you
to
make.
my
suggestion
was
not
that
the
policeman
should
determine
what
probable
cause
is
but
you
were
making
the
argument
that
the
existence
to
withdraw
the
silver
platter
doctrine
would
have
a
deterrent
effect
on
the
police.
and
my
suggestion
is
you
don't
deter
people
from
doing
something
that
they
think
is
right.
