mr.

did
i
understand
mr.

that
he
endeavored
to
--
to
find
out
what
the
true
version
of
this
arrest
was
before
the
district

and
the
district
judge
refused
to
let
him
put
on
testimony
concerning
officer

chief

district
court,
in
the
district
court?
chief

earl

was
he
--
he
was
not
denied
at
any
time
the
right
to
cross-examine
him
on
the

chief
justice
earl
warren
where
was
that
in

record?
it
might
be
material
to
what
we're
talking
about
now
on
question
of
findings.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
you

chief

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grossman,
before
you
take
your
seat,
on
behalf
of
the
court
i
should
like
to
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
in
--
in
defending
this
indigent
defendant.
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
appointed
you
to
carry
the
matter
through
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
to
--
to
this
court
in
order
to
--
to
see
that
in
your
judgment,
justice
was
done.
the
court
is
always
comforted
when
it
knows
that
lawyers
will
undertake
burdens
of
that
kind
without
compensation
or
just
because
of
their
brief
in
the
cause
of
justice.
so,
we
--
we
thank
you
very
much
for
your
earnest
enabled
presentation.
and
mr.
wilkey,
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
the
court
thank
you
also
for
your
earnest
enabled
presentation
of
the
cause
of
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
both.
