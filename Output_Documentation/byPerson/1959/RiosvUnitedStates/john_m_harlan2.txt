john
m.
harlan
when
they
went
up
at
the
traffic
light
identified
themselves,
did
they
open
the
door
of
the
cab
and
make
entrance
into
the
cab?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
court
of
appeals
correct
in
saying
that
you
did
not
contest
before
that
court
the
illegality
of
the
search
and
seizure?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
does
--
what
does
this
means
then
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
says
rios,
it's
talking
about
the
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
within
the
district
court,
rios,
is
it
not
argued
that
the
evidence
submitted
to
the
federal
court
fails
to
support
the
findings
and
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
that
they
received?
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
don't
discuss
it
in
their
opinion
though.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
the
point
at
which
the
officer
drew
his
gun?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
clear?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
that
reference
that
you
gave
to
the
statement
of
the
petitioner's
counsel?
you
said
he
admitted
he
didn't
have
a
gun.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
were
arguing
in
your
brief
tentatively
for
a
qualified
rule
of
admittance,
namely,
that
where
you
got
a
rochin
type
seizure,
you
may
want
to
use
that
expression
that
there
you
might
have
an
exclusionary
rule?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
a
--
which
you're
putting
to
the
court
from
the
government's
point
of
view
which
you
advocate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
either
view
--
under
either
view
of
your
--
under
either
view
of
the
problem
either
under
qualified
rule
--
qualified
rule
of
admittance
or
a
none
qualified
rule
of
admittance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
assuming
that
the
court,
this
pure
assumption
of
the
court
reaches
the
silver
platter
rule
in
both
cases,
that's
the
question
i'm
putting
into
this
as
to
what
kind
of
an
exclusionary
rule
or
absence
in
that
exclusionary
rule
are
you
recommending.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
primary
position
is
that
there
should
be
no
exclusionary
rule,
i
believe.
