whether

to
promulgate
a
rule

well,

--
under
specific
--
justice

stewart
--
rule
making
power
that
they
had.
justice

the

statutory
and
--
power
in
the
field
of
evidence
to
make
the
rule
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
based
upon
reason
and
experience,
is
that
not
true?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
--
justice

mr.
--
mr.

you
showed
us
the
colloquy
in
court
in
which
the
--
the
court,
the
judge,
of
course,
wasn't
there
that
night
and
the
lawyer
who
also,
of
course,
wasn't
there
that
night,
agreed
that
the
policeman
didn't
draw
his
gun
that
--
but
that
somebody
was
there
that
night,
i.e.
the
taxicab
driver
testified
very
explicitly
that
the
policeman
had
a
drawn
gun,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
--
the
petitioner
was
later
shot.
and
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
certainly
wasn't
shot
with
a
flashlight
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
this
package
picked
up
by
the
officer,

the
record
show?
justice
potter
stewart

policewoman
picked
it
up,
did
she?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
--
suppose
the
taxi
fare
have
not
yet
been
paid.
