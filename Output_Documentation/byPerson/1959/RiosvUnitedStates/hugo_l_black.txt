his
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
the
only
reason
on
which
it
rests?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think
of
the
differences
is
that
the
reasons
that
underlie
the
exclusion
of
evidence
obtained
by
unlawful
search
and
the
exclusion
of
evidence
which
is
confession
that
a
man
has
given
outside
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
ground
on
--
in
the
boyd
case?
you
remember?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
drew
some
--
found
some
similarities,
i
mean
the
reason
that
exclude
that
and
the
reason
that
excludes
the
confession
and
the
other
type
of
evidence
that's
been
unlawfully
obtained.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
the
basic
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you're
--
you're
going
on
the
basis
that
the
wrongfulness
in
using
evidence
illegally
obtained
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
ruling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
it's
a
mere
question
of
a
state,
of
a
court
formulated
rule,
it
would
be
there
important,
wasn't
it
as
to
whether
one
of
the
reasons
founded
the
rule
is
that
the
government
should
not
use
evidence
in
its
own
courts
that
was
obtained
in
violation
of
the
real
purpose
of
the
constitution
whether
obtained
by
one
officer
or
another
assuming
if
that
were
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
as
if
we
get
to
that
as
others.
i
see
you
didn't
cite
the
feldman
case.
do
you
think
that
has
no
bearing
on
your
case?
feldman
against
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
must
not
by
any
--
you
say
must
have
the
same
standards.
not
by
any
requirement
of
logic
or
compulsion
but
as
a
matter
of
policy
i
gather.
