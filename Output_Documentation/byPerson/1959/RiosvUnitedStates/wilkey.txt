mr.
wilkey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
position
in
the
rios
case
is
in
three
parts.
first
of
all,
we
take
the
position
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
was
no
arrest
until
after
the
officer
had
seen
and
identified
the
contraband.
and
that
--
and
an
officer
walking
up
to
a
car
and
identifying
himself
does
not
constitute
an
arrest.
secondly,
that
there
was
no
search
and
seizure
--
mr.
wilkey
well,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
wilkey
--
we
don't
agree
that
there
are
contradictory
versions.
we
think
that
what
happened
in
the
three
times
that
officer
--
the
officer
testified.
he
was
asked
different
questions
by
the
different
counsels.
and
the
federal
judge,
in
making
his
finding,
said
one
of
the
reasons
he
was
making
a
different
finding
from
the
state
court
was
that
additional
testimony
had
been
adduced.
and
i
don't
find
anything
contradictory
in
officer
beckmann's
testimony.
i
find
that
he
elaborated
on
and
explained
more
in
detail
of
what
he
had
said
before
but
i
find
no
contradictions
in
that.
that's
what
i
believe.
mr.
wilkey
i'll
give
you
that
one,
two,
three,
four,
your
honor.
the
third
point
i
want
to
mention
i'm
going
to
reach
is
--
or
second
point
that
there's
no
search
and
seizure
in
illegal
sense
at
all,
that
this
was
abandoned
contraband.
the
third
point
that
this
court
should
not
adopt
any
exclusionary
rule
here
excluding
the
evidence
in
the
federal
court
and
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
and
now,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
regard
to
these
facts,
first
of
all,
the
officers
were
intentionally
placed
in
a
neighborhood
with
the
second
worst
reputation
in
los
angeles
for
narcotics
activity.
and
this
very
officer
had
made
most
of
his
22
arrests
in
nine
months
in
this
neighborhood.
secondly
--
mr.
wilkey
apparently
so,
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
wilkey
i
--
i
see
your
point.
he
was
--
he
was
stationed
there.
and
my
point
is
that
during
the
time
he
was
there
and
spending
his
time
there,
he
made
22
arrests
--
mr.
wilkey
--
for
narcotics.
now,
secondly,
after
spending
his
time
there,
he
was
familiar
with
the
neighborhood
and
he
saw
a
cab
parked
here
on
this
parking
lot
by
the
apartment
house
and
that
was
unusual.
thirdly,
he
saw
the
petitioner
come
out
of
the
house,
walk
down
to
the
street,
look
around,
both
--
all
three
ways
on
the
corner,
then
go
back
walk
around
the
lot,
then
get
into
the
cab.
he
was
sufficiently
suspicious
to
him
and
his
fellow
officer
that
he
felt
he
ought
to
follow
the
car.
their
--
fourthly,
their
curiosity
aroused,
no
intent
to
make
any
arrest,
followed
the
car
to
see
where
it
would
go.
fifthly,
the
car
then
stopped
at
a
red
light
behind
other
cars
in
the
track.
sixthly,
the
officers
alighted
for
the
purpose
of
inquiry.
there
was
no
intent
to
arrest,
as
shown
by
the
record
here
on
page
14.
now,
i
understand
from
petitioner's
reply
brief,
particularly
on
page
9,
although
i'm
not
certain
of
this.
i
understand
that
petitioner
contends
that
the
arrest
was
made
at
the
time
the
officers
walked
up
to
the
cab
that
that
was
the
arrest
moment,
and
therefore,
on
that
basis,
there
--
it
was
illegal
because
there
was
no
probable
cause.
now,
we
say
that
there
was
no
arrest
at
that
time
and
we
make
no
argument
there
was
any
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
at
that
time.
seventhly,
the
officer,
with
flashlight
in
one
hand
and
badge
in
his
left
hand,
identified
himself
to
both
the
petitioner
and
the
driver
of
the
vehicle.
now,
there
was
no
threat
of
any
search.
there
was
no
threat
of
any
kind.
and
i
want
to
lay
at
rest
in
the
idea
that
the
officer
had
a
third
hand
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
at
this
moment
because
it
was
admitted
by
the
petitioner
below
on
page
23
when
the
petitioner
in
argument,
not
this
counsel
here
contended,
he
approached
his
gun
in
one
hand,
his
badge
in
the
other,
as
i
understand
it.
and
that
is
when
defendant
jumped
out
of
the
car
and
ran
he
said.
the
court,
“no,
he
had
his
flashlight
in
one
hand
and
his
badge
in
the
other.”
mr.
forno,
“that
is
right.
flashlight
and
the
badge
.that
is
right.”
the
court,
“that
is
right.”
so
--
mr.
wilkey
i
think
that
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
trial
judge
heard
all
of
the
evidence
available,
the
original
transcript,
the
testimony
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
and
he
found
on
all
of
the
evidence
that
there
was
no
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
secondly,
he
found
that
there
was
abandoned
contraband
here
and
in
fact
and
in
law,
no
search
and
seizure.
and
thirdly,
that
even
if
it
was
illegal,
the
silver
platter
doctrine
applied
and
the
evidence
was
receivable.
now,
we
submit
that
for
this
court
to
reverse
the
conviction,
this
court
would
have
to
say
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
search
was
reasonable,
would
--
you'd
have
to
upset
that
finding
on
the
facts.
that
is
correct.
mr.
wilkey
yes.
but
while
certiorari
was
sought
on
the
binding
effect
of
the
state
court
judgment,
it
was
not
granted
on
that.
it
was
limited
to
the
independent
determination
of
the
federal
court,
and
i
would
point
out
that
this
petitioner
does
not
concede
that
point.
but
in
elkins,
the
petitioner
conceded
that
the
federal
court
would
have
the
right
and
power
and
should
make
some
independent
determination.
now,
we
have
the
officer
identifying
himself
with
the
badge
and
the
flashlight.
now,
at
this
point,
still
--
mr.
wilkey
yes,
he
did.
and
i
suggest
this.
that
the
--
the
taxicab
driver's
testimony
must
be
evaluated
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
in
the
other
testimony
in
the
case.
and
the
taxicab
driver
was
not
positive
as
to
when
the
gun
was
drawn.
and
i
submit
that
on
the
facts,
the
time
when
the
gun
was
drawn
was
after
the
petitioner
alighted
from
the
cab
and
the
officer
had
put
away
his
flashlight
and
with
one
hand,
as
uncontradicted,
he
was
seeking
to
restrain
the
petitioner.
and
then,
at
that
time,
it
must
have
been
when
he
drew
the
gun.
and
the
petitioner
--
mr.
wilkey
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilkey
absolutely.
and
the
--
mr.
wilkey
not
unless
the
finding
on
the
facts
of
the
district
court
was
so
unreasonable
and
unwarranted
by
the
evidence.
mr.
wilkey
90
on
--
page
99,
i
believe
it
began,
the
middle
of
the
page,
i
--
second
paragraph.
i've
read
the
transcript
before
judge
otto
moore
the
next
paragraph.
there's
been
additional
testimony
before
this
court.
he
says,
“i
must
reach
the
conclusion.
there
was
reasonable
ground
for
the
arrest
and
that
there
was
nothing
unreasonable
about
it.”
mr.
wilkey
that's
the
finding
of
the
legal
conclusion
of
the
judge
reached.
and
then
he
recites
the
--
the
facts.
there
is
no
formal
finding
but
i
think
the
rule
in
the
federal
court
is
that
the
judge's
opinion
reciting
the
facts
may
be
taken
as
findings
of
facts.
and
that's
what
this
judge
did
here
very
carefully.
from
page
99
there
to
the
middle
of
page
down
--
near
the
bottom
of
page
100,
the
trial
judge,
united
states
judge,
recites
the
facts
as
he
understood
them
to
be
from
the
testimony
he
heard.
mr.
wilkey
i
believe
the
counsel
didn't
make
a
statement
like
that
but
the
record
reflects
that
defense
counsel
had
ample
opportunity
at
each
hearing
to
examine
officer
beckmann
and
while
--
mr.
wilkey
in
the
district
court,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
wilkey
i
think
that
there
are
two
or
three
places
in
the
record
where
the
trial
judge
said
that
a
further
inquiry
along
certain
lines
would
not
be
material.
mr.
wilkey
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
--
i
can'
find
that
at
this
precise
moment.
mr.
wilkey
i
would
like
to
do
that
if
i
may.
mr.
wilkey
counsel,
i
think,
do
not
point
that
out,
but
i
will
find
that
over
the
lunch
hour.
now,
at
this
point,
at
the
identification
and
all
of
these
things,
your
honor,
that
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i'm
discussing
are
brought
out
in
the
record
by
the
testimony
of
officer
beckmann
and
the
others
so
there's
ample
development
here,
i
think,
of
the
facts.
mr.
wilkey
i
will
find
it
for
you,
your
honor.
now,
after
the
identification
with
the
flashlight
in
one
hand
and
the
badge
in
the
other,
then
is
when
the
petitioner
did
what
he
need
not
have
done,
what
he
should
not
have
done
and
what
no
innocent
man
could
have
done.
he
removed
the
narcotics
in
the
container
and
dropped
them
on
the
floor.
now,
this
was
in
an
intersection
with
four
overhead
streetlights
fairly
illuminated
and
the
officer
had
a
flashlight,
and
he
saw
it.
and
he
was
an
experienced
narcotics
officer
and
he
identified
the
contraband
in
the
usual
container
and
he
realized
what
he
had.
now,
it
is
at
this
point.
it
is
at
this
point
that
not
only
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
exists
but
there
is
a
necessity
for
an
arrest
and
in
seizure
if
any
police
officer
is
doing
his
duty.
and
it
was
at
this
point
and
only
after
the
contraband
had
been
dropped
that
the
arrest
and
whatever
seizure
taking
there
was,
was
made.
there
is
conflicting
--
there
maybe
conflicting
testimony
as
to
the
exact
--
who
opened
what
door.
but
it
is
clear
that
the
petitioner
sought
to
alight
from
the
cab.
we
take
it
that
the
petitioner
and
the
officer
simultaneously
sought
to
open
the
door
and
that
petitioner
alighted.
he
certainly
made
no
effort
to
get
out
from
the
other
side
of
the
cab.
he
attempted
to
alight
on
that
side.
the
officer
seized
the
petitioner
on
one
hand
and
told
him
he
was
under
arrest.
with
the
other
hand,
he
attempted
to
reach
for
the
narcotics.
there
was
a
struggle.
i
think
at
this
moment,
he
drew
--
the
officer
drew
his
gun.
the
second
officer
came
around,
picked
up
the
narcotics,
and
the
petitioner
broke
loose,
ran,
and
was
apprehended
later
after
being
shot.
there
was
quite
a
struggle
as
the
record
reflects
the
details
of
the
struggle.
the
time
element
as
estimated
by
the
cab
driver
was
approximately
one
minute
from
the
time
the
officer
approached
the
cab
until
the
petitioner
broke
and
ran.
