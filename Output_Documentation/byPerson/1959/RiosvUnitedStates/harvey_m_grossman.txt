mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
petitioner
jose
rios
has
been
convicted
of
unlawful
possession
of
narcotics
and
sentenced
to
20
years
imprisonment
solely
on
the
basis
of
evidence
which
petitioner
asserts
was
obtained
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
the
evidence
was
obtained
by
state
officers
and
previously
suppressed
in
a
state
prosecution
under
the
exclusionary
rule
prevailing
in
california.
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
to
determine
two
questions.
first,
was
the
evidence
in
question
in
fact
obtained
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner
or
defendant?
secondly,
if
the
evidence
was
so
obtained,
was
it
nevertheless
admissible
under
the
so-called
silver
platter
doctrine
because
obtained
by
state
rather
than
federal
officers?
first,
the
factual
context
in
which
these
questions
have
to
be
resolved.
on
february
18th,
1957,
plain
clothes
officers
beckmann
and
grace
of
the
los
angeles
police
force
observed
the
defendant
enter
a
taxicab
at
the
vicinity
of
first
and
flower
streets,
an
intersection
near
the
los
angeles
pacific
center.
the
time
was
shortly
after
10:00
p.m.
at
the
time,
neither
officer
beckmann
nor
officer
grace
had
a
warrant
for
search
of
the
cab
or
the
defendant.
they
had
no
warrant
of
arrest.
in
fact,
their
own
testimony
states
that
they
had
no
idea
whatever
as
to
the
identity
of
the
defendant,
the
cab,
or
the
driver
nor
were
they
searching
for
a
participant
in
any
known
crime.
nevertheless,
they
testified
that
they,
and
i
quote,
“stake
out
on
the
cab
and
then
proceeded
to
follow
it
for
some
two
miles
until
it
arrived
at
first
and
state
streets”.
now,
their
explanation
for
what
seems
to
be
rather
extraordinary
conduct
is
as
follows.
first,
they
state,
according
to
officer
beckmann's
testimony,
that
before
the
defendant
entered
the
cab,
he
looked
about
up
and
down
the
street.
secondly,
officer
beckmann
said
that
some
three
months
previously,
he
had
arrested
another
defendant
not
connected
or
anyway
with
defendant
rios
in
the
same
locality,
and
this
defendant
was
also
using
a
taxicab,
so
this
paired
to
be
a
somewhat
suspicious
circumstance
as
far
as
officer
beckmann
was
concerned.
and
finally,
after
the
evidence
was
suppressed
in
the
state
court,
officer
beckmann
testified
that
he
recalled
that
the
airy
in
question
was
one
with
a
“bad
reputation
for
narcotics”,
whatever
that
may
mean.
now,
based
upon
this
rather
flimsy
fact
situation,
which
the
government
itself
conceded,
do
not
constitute
probable
cause,
the
police
proceeded
to
follow
the
cab
for
some
two
miles
in
an
unmarked
police
vehicle.
when
the
cab
stopped
momentarily
for
a
traffic
signal
at
first
and
state
streets,
the
police
car
pulled
up
behind
it.
officers
beckmann
and
grace
alighted
and
approached
the
cab
on
opposite
sides
and
officer
beckmann
identified
himself
to
the
defendant.
now,
with
respect
to
officer
beckmann's
intentions
in
that
regard,
he
testified
in
the
state
court
that
he
was
investigating
narcotics,
and
later
in
the
federal
proceedings,
added
that
it
was
his
intention
to
see
if
defendant
had
any
narcotics
in
his
possession.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
the
testimony
from
this
point
on,
i
might
say,
and
i
was
about
to
get
into
that,
is
a
bit
obscured,
because
officer
beckmann
told
two
stories
here.
he
told
one
story
in
the
state
court
and
after
the
state
court
suppressed
the
evidence,
suddenly
some
months
later
he
recalled
the
sequence
of
events
a
little
differently,
particularly
from
the
standpoint
of
the
timing
of
the
search
and
seizure.
originally,
officer
beckmann
testified,
and
i
might
say
incidentally
that
while
there
is
--
there
are
differences
in
the
two
factual
presentations,
we
don't
believe
probable
cause
has
established
even
if
we
take
the
best
of
the
many
versions
which
officer
beckmann
testified
to.
and
i
might
add
that
the
state
court's
testimony
was
received
in
evidence
in
the
federal
prosecution
pursuant
to
stipulation
that
officer
beckmann
would
have
testified
the
same
at
that
time
although
he
did
proceed
to
get
a
different
story.
now,
according
to
the
original
report
officer
beckmann
filed
shortly
after
the
events
in
question,
when
he
identified
himself
to
the
defendant,
he
saw
the
defendant
extract
a
white
object
from
his
pocket.
at
that
point,
officer
beckmann
said
he
opened
the
door
of
the
cab.
he
states
he
didn't
saw
the
defendant
drop
an
object
at
his
feet.
now,
when
the
officer
testified
in
the
federal
court
after
the
state
court
had
suppressed
the
evidence,
he
testified
somewhat
differently.
this
time,
he
testified
that
the
defendant
dropped
the
object
before
the
door
was
opened.
and
that
now,
it
was
not
only
officer
beckmann
but
the
defendant
and
officer
beckmann
who
opened
the
door,
a
somewhat
different
version.
the
cab
driver
who
was
called
as
a
witness
for
the
government
in
the
trial
court,
and
i
think
was
the
only
disinterested
observer
on
the
scene
and
whose
testimony
therefore
would
be
entitled
to
some
weight
here,
when
called
by
the
government
testified
that
while
defendant
was
still
in
the
cab,
officer
beckmann
opened
the
door,
grabbed
defendant
by
the
arm
and
brandish
a
revolver
at
which
point
the
cab
driver
states
he
protested
that
while
he
was
accustomed
to
routine
police
stopping
at
his
cab
and
searches,
the
presence
of
a
revolver
seemed
a
peculiar
circumstance
and
he
felt
that
the
officers'
conduct
was
unjustified
and
testified
he
complained
to
officer
beckmann.
so
the
cab
driver's
testimony
corresponds
with
the
original
version
of
officer
beckmann's
testimony,
namely,
that
officer
beckmann
opened
the
cab
door,
the
cab
driver
adds
he
grabbed
his
arm,
and
this
was
prior
to
the
time
the
object
in
question
apparently
had
even
been
dropped.
now,
officer
beckmann
testifies
as
to
two
versions
of
the
following
events
also.
in
his
original
testimony,
he
states
that
after
the
object
was
removed
from
the
defendant's
pocket,
at
this
point,
we
only
know
there
is
a
white
object,
this
is
all
he
has
noted,
defendant
dropped
the
objects
on
the
floor
of
the
cab,
there's
nothing
said
of
any
inspection
and
tempted
to
alight.
and
at
that
point,
officer
beckmann
grabbed
him
by
the
arm,
according
to
his
testimony,
and
said
to
the
defendant,
“you're
under
arrest.”
beckmann
then
told
his
partner
officer
grace,
“pick
up
the
object.”
this
was
done
and
officer
beckmann
now
observed
that
it
appeared
to
be
a
white
contra
--
a
contraceptive
containing
a
white
powder.
so
that
this
is
the
first
point,
according
to
the
original
version
of
which
officer
beckmann
even
had
occasion
to
examine
the
object
at
all.
in
the
federal
court,
he
adds
an
additional
fact
somewhat
contradicting
his
original
story.
now,
he
testifies
that
before
the
defendant
alighted
from
the
cab,
beckmann
momentarily
flashed
his
light
on
the
object
and
observed.
it
appeared
to
be
a
contraceptive
with
some
sort
of
light
colored
object
in
it,
although,
here
again,
he
acknowledged
that
he
didn't
really
recognize
the
nature
of
the
object
as
resembling
a
powder-like
narcotic
until
after
it
was
handed
to
him
by
officer
grace.
at
that
point,
the
arrest
was
not
only
made
in
fact
but
officer
beckmann
had
previously
told
the
defendant
“you're
under
arrest,”
and
grabbed
him
by
the
arm.
he
then,
as
i
say,
examined
the
object
with
the
view
to
ascertaining
its
contents
and
noted
apparently
for
the
first
time
which
he
had
not
truly
to
do
so
that
it
appeared
to
contain
some
sort
of
a
white
powder
which
later
investigation
proved
to
contain
heroin.
now,
officer
beckmann,
and
i
--
and
i
bring
this
up
merely,
because
in
light
of
the
contradictory
stories
the
officer
told,
his
attitude
toward
the
defendant
may
bear
some
irrelevance
here,
then
proceeded
to
pursue
the
defendant
into
an
alley
where
he
was
subdued
--
where
he
subdued
the
defendant
by
stopping
him
and
according
to
his
testimony
shooting
him
in
the
back
apparently
and
beating
him
with
what
he
referred
to
as
a
sap
or
a
blackjack.
now
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
a
sap
or
blackjack.
officer
beckmann
stated
he
subdued
the
defendant
after
he'd
shot
him
and
defendant
followed
he
beat
him
with
a
sap
which
appears
to
be
a
--
where
he
used
for
his
blackjack.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
he
testified,
and
i
might
say,
this
is
rather
peculiar
for
this
reason.
officer
beckmann
testified
he
shot
the
defendant
while
they
were
alone
in
an
alley,
but
for
some
reason,
was
somewhat
reluctant
to
reveal
the
testimony
after
this
sequence
of
events
even
when
he
was
on
the
stand.
he
said
that
he
stopped
the
defendant.
his
testimony,
at
least
at
one
point,
was
he
stopped
the
defendant
and
that
is
when
he
shot
him
while
the
defendant
was
faced
away
from
him
and
therefore,
of
course,
shot
him
in
the
back
that
defendant
began
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
this
was
after
he
pursued
him
into
an
alley.
i
imagine
a
distance
of
perhaps
half
a
block
to
a
block
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--
from
the
cab.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
the
defendant
apparently
--
yes.
after
--
after
the
arrest,
he
protested
his
innocence
to
the
officer
after
the
arrest
and
then
attempted
to
pray
for
the
officer
breakaway
whereupon
the
officer
pursued
him
and
told
him
to
stop
and
stopped
him,
and
then
after
he
had
stopped,
shot
and
beat
him,
as
i've
indicated.
now
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no.
the
defendant
--
there
was
no
testimony
at
all
by
the
defendant.
the
only
evidence
here,
and
this,
i
say,
is
surprisingly
alleged
in
the
various
versions
and
conflicts
here.
these
are
all
stories
by
the
state
police.
the
only
evidence
introduced
was
evidence
for
the
state
police
and
the
facts,
i
have
related,
are
based
solely
on
the
testimony
of
the
state
police
officers
and
the
cab
driver
called
as
a
witness
for
the
government.
now
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes.
i
was
about
to
mention.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no,
he
did
not
testify
on
the
motion
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--
to
suppress.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
one
in
state
and
one
in
federal
and
the
defendant
did
not
testify
on
either
motion.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
he
testified
on
state
motion
also.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
attempts
were
made
to
cross-examine
him
however,
the
trial
judge
took
the
position
that
the
extent
or
the
impeachment
consisted
in
simply
reading
into
the
record
the
contradictory
statements
and
would
not
permit
any
further
cross-examination
to
bring
out
these
inconsistencies.
and
i
might
say
that
in
the
course
of
the
federal
hearing,
when
effort
was
made
to
question
officer
beckmann
as
to
his
intent
in
connection
with
approaching
the
cab
and
the
events
in
question
which
we
deemed
entirely
material,
the
government
objected
on
the
ground
that
the
intent
of
the
police
dip
matter
one
bit,
a
somewhat
different
position
that
the
government
is
now
urging,
and
that
objection
was
sustained
and
that
line
of
inquiry
was
stopped,
so
that
efforts
to
bring
out
these
contradictions
and
so
on
by
cross-examination
were
restricted
as
it
appears
in
our
brief
and
we've
cited
the
pertinent
passages.
now,
following
the
events
i've
related,
a
trial
was
held
in
the
state
court.
and
at
this
trial,
the
trial
judge
suppressed
the
evidence
and
unlike
elkins,
the
record
in
this
regard
here
is
quite
clear.
a
motion
to
suppress
was
made
and
granted
under
the
state
exclusionary
rule
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
was
seized
unconstitutionally
on
the
basis
of
a
search
seizure
and
arrest
without
probable
cause.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
this
was
all
under
the
cahan
case,
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
the
--
i
can
only
say
that
the
state
court
held
it
unconstitutional.
and
apparently,
from
all
that
appears
in
the
record
regardless
that
it
was
unconstitutional
under
both
the
state
and
federal
constitutions.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes.
it
appears
in
the
record.
actually,
there
at
page
24
of
the
record,
near
the
bottom
of
the
page,
he
states
after
reviewing
the
--
after
stating
--
i
can't
possibly
see
how
this
arrest
could
had
originally
been
attempted
under
the
information
the
officer
very
frankly
tells
us
that
he
had.
and
i
don't
think
any
reasonable
man
would
think
a
felony
had
been
committed
because
a
man
comes
out
of
a
building,
looks
up
the
street
and
so
forth,
and
then
he
states
that
your
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
will
be
granted.
the
people
rested.
at
that
point,
they
put
on
no
further
evidence
and
therefore,
since
the
only
evidence
they'd
offered,
and
this
was
also
the
only
evidence
actually
the
government
offered
essentially
at
the
state
court
--
at
the
federal
trial
had
been
suppressed.
naturally,
it
followed
that
a
judgment
of
acquittal
was
entered.
so
it's
clear
that
the
evidence
here
was
suppressed
by
the
state
court.
now
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
i
might
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no,
there's
nothing
specific
--
we
--
we
recognize
that
it
is
somewhat
ambiguous
as
far
as
the
federal
versus
state
issue
is
concerned.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes.
now,
as
i
have
stated
the
--
as
i
have
stated,
the
evidence
was
suppressed
by
the
state
court.
and
officer
beckmann
--
and
in
this
case,
there's
another
distinguishing
factor
from
elkins
just
argued,
and
that
is
this.
after
the
evidence
was
suppressed
by
the
state
court,
there
is
no
question
even
under
officer
beckmann's
own
testimony
but
that
he
went
to
the
federal
authorities
after
he
consulted
his
superiors
and
presented
the
prosecution
of
the
facts
upon
which
the
prosecution
had
been
based
to
the
federal
authorities
and
consulted
with
them,
whereupon,
in
fact
he
stated
that
he
was
the
--
he
acknowledged,
he
was
the
instigator
of
the
federal
prosecution.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
that's
quite
clear,
mr.
justice
brennan.
there's
no
question
as
to
that.
now,
the
federal
authorities
then
prosecuted
defendant
for
unlawful
possession
growing
out
of
the
very
same
transaction
involved
here.
the
government
stipulated
on
the
motion
to
suppress
that
the
very
same
possession
was
involved
and
they
intended
to
introduce
the
same
evidence
the
state
court
had
suppressed.
so
that
in
effect
here,
the
state
officer
had
crossed
the
street
to
the
federal
courthouse
and
now,
another
prosecution
was
under
way
a
federal
prosecution
arising
out
of
the
same
set
of
circumstances.
the
motion
to
suppress
was
denied.
the
trial
court,
being
of
the
view
first
that
he
didn't
feel
there
was
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
and
secondly,
that
even
if
there
was,
this
didn't
really
matter
because
the
silver
platter
doctrine
meant
that
the
evidence
would
be
introduced
in
the
absence
of
evidence
of
federal
participation.
and
the
trial
judges
views
in
that
regard,
i
think,
are
reflected
in
the
fact
that
when
we
endeavored
to
cross-examine
officer
beckmann
as
to
any
general
patterns
of
cooperation,
which
the
court
on
its
own
motion
objected
to
the
line
of
questioning
stating
that
the
only
thing
pertinent
as
far
as
cooperation
under
silver
platter
is
concerned,
was
cooperation
on
the
particular
case
involved,
and
we
question
the
soundness
of
that
even
under
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
same
grounds
that
the
trial
court
had
rendered
its
decision.
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
determine
first
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
search
and
seizure
and
secondly,
the
silver
platter
doctrine
in
the
event
that
search
and
seizure
were
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no.
let
me
--
may
--
may
i
state,
and
the
government
made
a
very
brief
reference
and
i
think
the
gravity
of
the
government's
reference
is
due
to
the
fact
that
quite
clearly
in
the
trial
court,
we
stated
that
after
the
trial
court
considered
it
had
a
right
to
review
the
facts
independent
of
the
state
court's
determination
and
rejected
our
contention
that
they
were
precluded
by
the
state
court's
determination.
we
stated
that
without
waiving
our
rights
in
that
regard,
we
would
now
proceed
to
try
the
illegality
of
the
search
and
therefore,
we
present
it
in
evidence.
the
transcript
of
the
state
court
proceedings
and
argued
at
some
length
in
the
trial
court
that
the
search
and
seizure
was
unlawful.
our
initial
position
had
been
that
the
court
should
not
get
into
that
because
of
the
state
court's
determination
but
as
a
second
position
when
the
court
declined
to
do
so,
we
took
the
position
that
we
would
establish
the
unlawfulness
of
the
search
and
seizure
de
novo
and
made
every
effort
to
do
so.
so
that
it
is
not
correct
that
we
did
not
challenge
the
unlawfulness
of
the
search
and
seizure,
we
simply
said
that
while
we
believe
it's
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
we
also
don't
waive
our
claim
that
the
state
court
determination
here
precludes
a
federal
reexamination.
and
if
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
i
might
say
that
the
only
explanation
for
that,
mr.
justice
harlan,
maybe
that
as
a
result
of
extensive
interrogation
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
question
particularly
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine
and
the
effect
of
some
of
these
court's
opinions
our
argument
--
our
oral
argument
at
least
did
not
get
in,
in
great
length
to
the
unlawfulness
of
the
search
and
seizure
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
we
discuss
--
we
discuss
the
search
and
seizure
in
the
brief,
yes,
the
--
the
question
of
unlawfulness.
and
it's
quite
clear
we
have
never
--
i
might
say
that
we
never
conceded
that
the
search
and
seizure
was
lawful.
in
fact,
we
have
always
maintained
that
the
search
and
seizure
was
unlawful.
it
was
our
position
as
i
state
that
since
this
was
prior
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
abbate
and
--
and
bartkus
and
the
limited
grants
assert
here
that
it
wasn't
proper
for
the
state
court
to
reexamine
the
issue
in
terms
of
the
unlawfulness
of
the
search
and
seizure.
and
we
believe
that
in
terms
of
emphasis,
i
can
truly
say
that
we
emphasize
at
that
point
would
seem
to
be
the
--
a
principal
point,
namely
that
there
was
no
need
to
determine
the
unlawfulness
of
the
search
and
seizure
because
on
the
facts
of
the
state
determination,
that
issue
was
foreclosed
from
federal
reexamination.
and
what
we
said
in
effect
was,
and
i
gather
this
perhaps
made
here
some
relation
to
what
the
government
said
in
the
elkins
case
below,
although
i'm
not
too
familiar
with
the
record
in
that
case.
what
we
said
was
the
question
of
illegality
isn't
really
one
which
has
to
be
reached
here
because
we
don't
feel
that
there's
any
basis
for
reexamination
or
redetermination
of
the
question
in
the
federal
court.
but
in
the
federal
district
court,
we
made
a
record
and
we
--
among
our
statement
of
grounds,
we
definitely
included
within
the
compass
of
that,
the
assertion
that
the
evidence
was
obtained
by
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
and
as
i
say
the
state
court,
the
--
if
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
had
any
indication
that
that
point
was
not
being
pressed,
i
frankly
don't
feel
that
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no,
they
didn't
discuss
it
in
their
opinion.
in
fact,
there
were
many
contentions
we
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
didn't
discuss
in
their
opinion
and
--
such
as
the
questions
we
raised
as
to
the
application
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine
and
the
possible
mcnabb
approach
and
so
on
which
we
had
suggested
in
argument.
i
mean
their
--
their
opinion
treated
the
matter
as
a
rather
routine
one
and
--
and
left
many
of
the
questions
unanswered.
most
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
devoted
to
the
jencks
rule
which
was
about
the
last
point
in
our
brief
and
one
which
we
didn't
even
present
here
and
which
was
really
a
minor
point
in
our
argument,
but
one
which
apparently
intrigue
the
court
of
appeals
sufficiently
that
they
seized
upon
this
as
the
principle
subject
to
their
discussion,
perhaps
dealing
with
the
silver
platter
doctrine
was
so
firmly
established
that
these
other
questions
were
too
important.
but
as
i
state,
we
did
contest,
we
did
contest
and
the
reading
of
the
record
in
the
district
court
will
show
quite
clearly
that
we
clasp
the
unlawfulness
of
the
search
and
seizure
and
we
certainly
do
so
here.
now,
the
question
then,
we
submit,
is,
was
there
an
unlawful
--
search
and
seizure
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
i
believe
that
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
i
believe
the
--
the
silver
platter
doctrine
at
least
as
it
was
applied
certainly
as
it
is
applied
here
and
--
and
i
would
agree
with
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
in
all
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine,
the
question
would
not
be
involved,
there
was
no
question
of
illegality
were
involved
and
that
is
--
that
is
a
presupposition
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine
if
we
assume
that
to
be
a
valid
doctrine.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes.
and
--
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
first
question
here
is
to
determine
the
unlawfulness
of
the
search
and
seizure.
now,
our
belief
is
that
the
question
of
the
unlawfulness
under
state
law
in
light
of
the
state
court's
determination
is
not
properly
a
matter
for
reexamination
in
the
federal
courts,
but
we
think
there
is
another
matter
which
the
federal
courts
may
properly
examine
at
least,
and
we
particularly
submit
this
in
light
of
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari
here,
and
that
is,
whether
aside
from
violating
the
state
constitutional
standards,
the
search
and
seizure
here
violated
federal
constitutional
standards
because
it
was
made
without
probable
cause.
and
that
gets
us
to
in
a
sense
to
the
heart
of
the
problem
of
unlawful
search
and
seizure
as
it's
presented
here.
now
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
may
i
say
this.
we
--
we
think
that
the
--
well
we
believe
that
the
guarantee
of
freedom
from
arbitrary
police
invasion
of
privacy
contained
in
a
fourth
amendment
is
implicit
in
the
concept
of
our
liberty
as
described
in
the
wolf
case.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
may
--
may
i
say
that
while
--
and
--
and
i
shall
proceed
to
this
point
later,
while
we
believe
that
the
wolf
holding,
insofar
as
the
constitutional
question
is
involved,
took
the
position
that
while
evidence
unlawfully
seized
may
not
be
excludable
in
the
federal
courts,
that
nevertheless
such
--
where
the
state
sanction
such
unlawful
searches
and
seizures,
it
is
acting
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
think
that
there
is
--
it
is
not
necessary
actually
to
rest
this
case
solely
upon
wolf,
because
after
all,
the
final
analysis
we
are
dealing
here
with
federal
courts.
in
the
wolf
case,
the
court
was
confronted
with
the
very
different
problem,
because
there,
the
only
possible
reach
of
the
court
in
--
in
a
sense
or
--
or
basis
for
the
court
to
apply
was
due
process
because
we
had
state
courts
and
state
officers.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
here
--
here
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
now,
insofar
as
the
question
of
the
unlawfulness
of
the
search
and
seizure
and
i
--
and
i
believe
it
was
my
intention
to
--
to
indicate
that
the
standards
which
were
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
cases
involving
exclusion
of
evidence
seized
by
federal
officers
which
we
believe
are
pertinent
to
the
application
of
an
exclusionary
rule
by
state
officers
regardless
of
whether
it
is
deemed
to
rest
upon
constitutional
grounds
or
on
grounds
of
supervisory
powers
or
whatever
grounds
it
may
rest
upon.
we
think
that
certainly,
determining
whether
the
evidence
was
seized
with
or
without
probable
cause
which
both
the
states
and
federal
governments
with
practical
unanimity
apply
as
the
test
of
a
lawful
search
and
seizure
is
one
that
lies
at
the
crux
of
the
problem.
now,
in
that
regard,
we
believe
that
this
case
presents
facts
which
lie
outside
the
periphery
of
the
area
of
permissible
search
and
seizure
as
this
court
described
the
facts
in
brinegar
and
in
the
carroll
case,
because
in
those
cases,
the
facts
involved
a
driver
and
a
vehicle
recognized
as
having
been
lately
involved
in
unlawful
operations,
whereas
in
the
present
case,
the
--
and
also
was
heading
for
a
probable
illegal
market.
in
the
present
case,
the
police
testified
they
had
no
idea
as
to
who
this
defendant
was
or
what
the
taxi
cab
was
and
so
on.
in
other
words,
it's
not
surprising
the
government
concedes
a
lack
of
probable
cause
at
the
outset
of
the
transaction.
now,
we
submit
that
events
that
occurred
later
in
the
course
of
the
transaction
cannot
validate
an
enterprise
embarked
on
according
to
the
police
to
see
if
defendant
had
narcotics
in
his
possession,
cannot
validate
an
enterprise
unlawful
from
its
beginning
and
further
that
even
at
the
time
the
police
made
their
formal
arrest
of
the
defendant,
even
after
they'd
grabbed
him,
officer
beckmann
had
reached
them
and
grabbed
defendant
by
the
arm
and
so
forth,
even
then
there
was
no
probable
cause
because
it
wasn't
till
the
defendant
had
alighted
from
the
taxi
cab
and
been
placed
under
formal
arrest.
not
only
under
a
--
an
arrest
in
fact
similar
to
that
in
the
henry
case
recently
decided
by
this
court.
it
wasn't
until
then
that
the
police
first
really
made
any
real
observation
of
this
object
and
then
determined
that
it
appeared
to
be
a
container
of
a
narcotic
powder.
and
we
submit
at
that
point
certainly
the
police
could
not
justify
the
prior
course
of
conduct.
in
other
words,
while
the
transaction
was
unlawful
from
its
inception
and
the
search
and
seizure
began
at
an
earlier
point,
we
submit
probable
cause
doesn't
come
into
the
picture
until
a
much
later
time.
certainly,
officer
beckmann's
later
suggestion
that
he
flashed
his
light
on
the
object
and
momentarily
viewed
it
while
defendant
was
still
in
the
cab
which
is
certainly
in
about
face
from
his
original
state
court
testimony
which
the
government
vouched
for
and
entered
in
and
stipulated
to
introduction
of
in
the
federal
court
proceeding.
we
don't
think
that
an
officer
should
be
able
to
justify
conduct
in
a
probable
cause
theory
on
any
such
flimsy
ground.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
--
that
while
the
same
facts
relating
to
illegality
would
be
presented
in
either
case
as
posed
by
the
justice,
that
the
basis
of
exclusion
would
not
necessarily
have
to
be
the
same.
it
may
very
well
be
that
we
would
attempt
to
show
either
case
that
the
officers
acted
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause.
but
having
established
that
fact,
then
determining
why
this
court
should
exclude
the
evidence
could
be
based,
of
course,
upon
an
argument.
and
we
submit
that
one
of
our
bases
for
so
urging
would
be
the
constitutional
argument,
namely,
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
and
i
might
say
that
the
fourth
amendment,
i
think,
comes
to
the
play
here
in
a
somewhat
different
way.
and
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
something
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
yesterday.
\we're
dealing
here
with
federal
action
regardless
of
whether
we're
talking
about
state
or
federal
officers
because
there
are
federal
courts
involved
here.
and
to
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
--
and
i
will
take
issue
with
mr.
counsel
wiener's
argument
on
this
point
yesterday.
we
submit
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
a
very
vital
part
here
because
to
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
federal
officers
is
only
part
of
the
story.
we
submit
that
it
should
very
well
apply
to
actions
of
the
federal
courts,
so
that
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
case.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
we
submit
that
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
may
i
state
if
--
if
i
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
if
--
if
i
mislead
mr.
justice
stewart
in
that
regard,
i
do
not
mean
to.
it
was
my
suggestion
by
way
of
clarifying
the
question
he
posed
to
indicate
that
in
this
case,
unlike
elkins,
the
instigation
of
the
federal
prosecution
without
question
was
one
by
the
state
officers,
because
the
state
policeman
said
when
i
couldn't
get
my
name
convicted
in
the
state
courts,
so
i
consulted
my
superiors
and
we
decided
the
best
way
to
do
it
then
was
to
go
over
to
the
federal
courthouse,
and
i
then
went
over
and
told
them
about
the
facts
and
instigated
a
federal
prosecution.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
in
terms
of
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
may
i
say
in
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
that
we
believe
that
while
--
there
was
no
participation.
we
agree
there
was
no
participation
by
the
federal
officers
the
time
officer
beckmann
and
grace
approached
this
cab.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
officer
beckmann,
and
this
was
relevance
to
any
suggestion
that
there
was
any
--
that
there
was
the
danger
bungling
state
officers
interfering
with
federal
prosecutions
when
they
well
asked
if
officer
beckmann
and
grace
had
never
made
the
search
and
seizure
and
turn
this
evidence
over
to
the
federal
authorities,
how
in
the
world
can
we
assume
that
there
would
have
been
a
federal
prosecution.
now,
when
they
came
to
the
federal
authorities,
we
quite
frankly
believe
that
with
the
federal
authorities
should
quite
properly
have
done.
and
if
the
court
decides
this
case,
as
we
are
urging
it
to
be
decided,
would
do
would
be
to
say
having
obtained
this
evidence
unlawfully,
we
cannot
--
we
will
not
land
our
aid
and
neither
can
we
invoke
the
aid
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
not
a
--
not
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
seizure,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
it
--
it
is
our
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
it's
our
position
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--
with
full
knowledge
of
what
--
how
it
was
required.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no.
mr.
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is
our
position
that
there
was
no
participation
at
the
outset
at
the
time
the
search
and
seizure
was
conducted,
and
that
of
course
is
the
reason
we
have
asked
this
court
to
reject
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
obviously,
if
the
case
was
one
in
which
there
was
participation
in
the
particular
case,
the
silver
platter
question
would
never
have
reached
this
court.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
in
this
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
in
this
case,
there
is
no
participation
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--
except
the
fact
that
the
evidence,
when
turned
over
by
officer
beckmann,
was
being
used,
prior
to
that
time,
there
was
no
participation.
now
--
but
it
is
our
position,
and
getting
back
to
the
some
of
the
questions
previously
posed
that
even
in
the
absence
of
participation,
the
federal
court,
either
on
constitutional
ground,
which
i've
already
mentioned
or
on
the
basis
of
the
mcnabb
approach,
in
the
exercise
with
supervisory
over
--
powers
over
the
federal
courts,
should
not
say
granted
this
evidence
was
seized
without
probable
cause,
granted
if
it
had
been
seized
by
federal
officers
that
we
would
reject
it,
granted
that
we
believe
that
with
the
state
sanctions
unlawful
searches
and
seizures,
it
is
acting
in
derogation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
granted
that
the
states
in
an
effort
to
preclude
unlawful
searches
and
seizures
has
attempted
to
exclude
this
evidence
and
to
discipline
its
officers.
nevertheless,
we
feel
that
if
the
officer
comes
into
the
federal
court
in
such
a
situation,
we
will
permit
him
to
introduce
this
evidence
in
a
federal
prosecution.
now,
i
might
say
at
that
point
that
the
exclusionary
rule
of
the
state
courts
is
a
matter
which
can't
be
ignored
by
this
court
because
assuming
the
court
is
merely
can
deal
with
the
problem
as
one
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
powers
in
fashioning
a
rule
in
the
exercise
of
those
powers,
can
the
court
properly
disregard
the
fact
that
21
of
the
states
in
which
the
rule
is
going
to
be
applied,
21
or
almost
half
of
the
states
now
follow
the
weeks
rule.
and
in
those
states,
the
disciplinary
effect
of
the
state
rule
will
be
seriously
undermined
if
the
state
officers
need
only
do
what
officer
beckmann
did
here
and
cross
the
state
--
the
street
to
the
federal
courthouse,
nor
can
it
be
said
that,
as
was
indicated
in
the
wolf
opinion,
that
proper
respect
is
being
given
to
the
state
judicial
processes
and
the
rights
of
the
state
to
choose
their
methods
when
california
finds
the
only
means
it
has
to
exclude
unlawfully
seized
evidence,
or
i
should
say
to
deter
unlawful
searches
and
seizures,
is
to
exclude
evidence
unlawfully
seized
as
well
explained
by
justice
traynor
in
the
cahan
case
and
the
courts
nevertheless
state
that
where
the
state
attempts
to
invoke
the
exclusionary
rule,
a
federal
court
will
lend
its
aid
to
such
an
undertaking.
and
i
might
say
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
problem
in
shaping
the
rule
that
bears
consideration.
and
that
is
this.
this
isn't
simply
a
case
of
bungling
by
state
officers
which
embarrasses
a
federal
prosecution.
not
only
was
this
a
prosecution
which
was
first
called
to
the
attention
of
the
federal
authorities
by
the
very
state
officers
who
made
the
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
but
this
is
a
case
where,
assuming
our
contention
as
to
the
facts
to
be
correct,
there
was
a
search
and
seizure
without
probable
cause
in
violation
of
constitutional
standards
laid
down
by
this
court
as
well
as
by
the
california
courts.
now,
such
a
search
and
seizure,
we
submit,
doesn't
involve
mere
bungling.
it
involves
an
invasion
of
constitutional
rights
which
should
be
deterred
and
while
it
maybe
that
an
individual
in
a
given
case
would
go
free
if
the
exclusionary
rule
is
invoked
in
such
a
case,
and
the
same
course
is
true
in
a
federal
prosecution
where
federal
officers
are
involved,
we
submit
that
whereas
--
certainly
where
the
states
have
gradually
been
determining
that
the
only
effective
means
of
enforcing
the
constitutional
guarantee
is
to
exclude
the
evidence,
that
the
federal
courts
should
not
say,
well,
we
believe
that
where
state
officers
were
involved
in
spite
of
the
fact
the
states
may
feel
the
contrary,
the
need
to
convict
the
defendant
outlays
the
need
to
deter
invasions
of
his
constitutional
rights.
and
so
we
submit
that
this
isn't
the
case
of
mere
technical
or
minor
violations
but
one
of
very
serious
violations
of
rights.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
we
believe
this
--
yes,
we
believe
that
this
case
can
very
properly
be
resolved
as
a
rule
of
evidence
for
the
federal
courts.
and
that
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
under
the
mcnabb
approach.
in
other
words,
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--
constitutional
question.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
it
has
the
rule
making
power.
and
unlike
a
situation
such
as
wolf
where
deference
to
the
state
court
rule
making
power
is
involved,
if
this
court
were
to
say,
“well,
it
isn't
for
us
to
decide
what
evidence
is
to
be
admitted
or
excluded,”
one,
they
will
ask,
“who
is
going
to
assume
that
function?”
so
we
believe
that
the
disciplinary
rule
can
be
invoked
as
a
rule
of
evidence
in
the
federal
courts.
and
further
we
submit
that
regardless
which
approach
the
court
takes
here,
the
court
is
going
to
be
fashioning
a
rule
of
evidence
because
if
the
court
should
adopt
the
silver
platter
doctrine
and
say
that
regardless
of
the
question
of
illegality,
the
fact
that
state
officers
seize
the
evidence,
makes
it
admissible
whereas
a
federal
officer
seizes
it,
it's
not
admissible,
this,
in
itself,
is
fashioning
a
rule
of
evidence.
so
this
court
has
to
pass
essentially
on
the
question
of
fashioning
the
rule
of
evidence.
and
we
believe
under
the
mcnabb
approach,
the
proper
rule
is
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
that
is
correct.
and
we
believe
reason
and
experience
dictate
under
the
rule
making
power
of
this
court
that
the
evidence
which
is
obtained
under
circumstances
of
this
case
should
be
excluded.
and
in
fashioning
such
a
rule
of
evidence,
this
court,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
observed,
would
merely
be
fashioning
a
rule
within
its
general
rule
making
power.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
all
that's
necessary
here.
so
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes,
we
--
we
believe
that
there
--
that
there
are,
if
the
court
takes
the
approach
that
that
is
the
--
is
the
standard
to
be
applied.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes.
may
i
state
in
that
regard
that
we
believe
that
if
a
case
by
case
approach
were
adopted,
well,
we
don't
--
we
do
not
expressly
advocate
that
as
a
rule
because
we
think
a
much
simpler
rule
of
evidence
among
which
would
serve
much
more
purposely
to
discipline
state
officers
would
be
the
same
categorical
rule
applied
in
the
case
of
federal
officers,
rather
than
telling
them
that
they
must,
at
their
hazard,
determine
whether
they
are
seizing
it
too
unlawfully
or
--
or
unlawfully
enough
even
if
the
approach
of
the
case
by
case
analysis
were
taken
here.
we
think
that
a
case
where
a
search
is
made
without
probable
cause
is
a
far
greater
thing
than
even
a
search
in
an
effect
of
warrant,
because
it
puts
the
police
officer,
in
a
sense,
in
the
role
of
the
one
who
is
acting,
enacting,
i
might
say,
without
the
sanction
of
the
probable
cause
which
the
courts
have
--
have
indicated
as
a
proper
standard.
in
other
words,
we
think
even
if
a
case
by
case
approach
were
adopted
in
the
case
of
unlawfully
procured
evidence,
where
lack
of
probable
cause
is
involved,
and
practically
every
case,
this
would
be
a
case
where
the
court
should
exclude
the
evidence,
because
to
do
otherwise
would
be
to
say
that,
for
instance,
if
the
good
faith
of
the
officer
were
to
be
the
controlling
factor,
then
he,
rather
than
the
judicial
authorities,
would
be
the
ones
to
decide
the
test
of
probable
cause,
because
if
he
thought
probable
cause
existed,
he'd
be
in
good
faith,
and
if
no
probable
cause
existed,
there's
nothing
the
federal
courts
could
do
about
it.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
this
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
may
i
say
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
the
difficulties
of
drawing
the
lines
of
the
reason
i
had
suggested,
if
the
court
please,
that
perhaps
an
absolute
prohibition
without
drawing
the
lines
is
done
in
the
case
of
federal
officers
is
the
proper
approach
because
that
avoids
the
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--
amount
to
the
problem.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes.
and
we're
--
we're
contending
--
we
believe
the
proper
approach
and
the
proper
rule
would
be
a
general
rule
of
exclusion
because
the
very
problems
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
refers
to
could
properly
be
avoided
by
simply
laying
down
as
a
rule
of
evidence
a
general
rule.
and
in
that
way,
we
avoid
problems
not
only
of
measuring
degree
of
unlawfulness.
we
avoid
problems
of
injunctions
as
in
the
elkins
case.
we
avoid
problems
of
federal
state
conflicts
by
permitting
state
officers
to
circumvent
state
exclusionary
rules
as
happened
in
--
in
our
case.
we
avoid
all
of
these
problems
by
simple
clearcut
rule
of
evidence
which
we
think
is
founded
on
proper
policy
consideration
which
we've
outlined
at
length
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
may
--
was
that
a
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no.
i
--
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
rule
which
we
had
in
mind
could
well
be
fashioned
in
light
of
federal
exclusionary
rule
which
we
think
would
serve
as
a
good
guide
in
fashioning
a
rule
in
this
area
under
the
rule
making
power
of
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
the
court
please,
in
the
time
remaining
few
additional
points.
first
of
all,
we
submit
an
answer
to
a
query
as
to
why
the
federal
court
should
--
why
this
court
should
not
accept
findings
of
--
so-called
findings
of
the
lower
court,
the
fact
that
first
as
it's
been
indicated
there
were
no
findings
in
any
sense
of
the
term
mere
conclusions
for
the
district
court.
secondly,
this
is
not
merely
a
case
where
two
courts
were
involved
but
three
and
perhaps
two
of
the
three
took
one
view
that
at
least
the
state
court
took
a
different
view
and
this
certainly
raises
questions
and
they
raised
--
those
questions
are
particularly
serious
in
light
of
the
fact
that
first
the
stories,
we
submit,
a
reading
of
the
record
reveals
beyond
question
that
officer
beckmann
changed
his
story
in
several
particular
as
he
testified
quite
differently
as
to
the
sequence
of
opening
the
door,
a
very
important
fact
in
the
state
court
than
he
did
in
the
federal
court.
there
were
important
versions
here
and
differences
and
these
aren't
indifferences
between
defendants
and
plaintiff's
story,
these
are
differences
in
stories
the
government
presented
with
the
stamp
on
arrestee
presumably.
certainly
the
government
can't
come
in
here
and
say
the
cab
driver,
when
he
testified
to
the
revolver
incident
after
the
government
put
him
on
as
a
witness,
is
one
of
the
government
is
going
to
try
to
impeach
now
because
they
were
putting
on
someone
who
wasn't
going
to
tell
the
truth
nor
can
the
government
say
that
mr.
forno
who
was
counseled
for
the
defendant
in
the
state
court
proceedings
knew
more
about
what
transpired
there
than
the
witnesses
present.
in
short,
we
submit
this
is
a
case
where
the
record
on
the
state
of
facts
is
such
that
examination
by
this
court
is
warranted
and
called
for
and
that
one
other
fact.
the
chief,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
raised
the
question
as
to
restrictions
and
cross-examination.
we've
looked
a
little
more
carefully
than
the
government
perhaps
because
we
find
several
instances
for
example
on
pages
84
to
85
of
the
record,
the
state
court
--
the
federal
district
court
judge
announced
the
very
restrictive
rule
of
cross-examination
stating
that
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
raid
the
inconsistent
statement
into
the
record
and
that
nothing
further
could
be
done
because
that's
the
limit
of
impeachment
under
his
view.
we
submit
it's
an
erroneous
view
and
it's
unfortunate
that
he
thus
limited
examination
as
to
a
key
issue
in
the
case.
at
that
point,
we
were
trying
to
show
the
inconsistency
in
the
prior
statements
as
to
the
sequence
of
events
of
opening
the
door
and
so
forth.
there
are
other
instances
when
we
attempted
to
get
into
the
question
with
federal
participations,
as
the
government
mentioned
they
were
restricted.
again,
we
were
restricted
in
our
cross-examination
on
page
65
when
we
asked
officer
beckmann
what's
his
intent.
was
he
intending
a
search
and
seizure?
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
page
65.
and
the
government
objected
on
the
ground
that
matters
of
intent
were
irrelevant
and
therefore
the
court
sustained
the
objection
and
that
was
the
end
of
that.
in
short,
there
were
various
instances
where
we
did
not
have
a
full
opportunity
to
present
all
of
the
cross-examination
in
the
federal
court
and
this
should
be
considered
in
judging
the
federal
court's
determination
or
its
approach
of
the
adequacy
of
its
determination.
now
with
reference
to
the
henry
case,
we
submit,
that
if
the
petitioner
had
endeavoured
to
drive
off
and
officer
beckmann
approached
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
investigating
narcotics
to
see
if
defendant
had
narcotics
in
his
possession,
obviously,
whether
with
--
with
we
they
call
a
revolver
or
what
the
government
counsel
refers
to
as
a
flashlight,
most
certainly
he
would
have
taken
forceful
means
of
stopping
the
defendant,
so
the
defendant
was
at
that
point
under
restraint.
and
further,
officer
beckmann
made
a
formal
arrest
prior
to
the
time
he
ever
actually
had
any
real
opportunity
to
examine
the
narcotics
because
that
was
after
defendant
alighted
from
the
cab,
he
was
grabbed
by
the
arm
again.
the
driver
says
also
grabbed
while
inside
the
cab
and
told
that
he
was
under
arrest,
only
then,
that
the
police
actually
bothered
to
take
the
trouble
to
look
at
the
material
in
question.
now,
insofar
as
the
question
of
adopting
a
rule
by
this
court
is
concerned,
first
of
all,
there
was
we
submit
federal
participation
here
not
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
seizure,
but
when
the
federal
prosecution
used
this
evidence
in
question.
when
the
federal
courts
permitted
a
prosecution
to
be
sustained
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence,
at
that
point
we
think,
the
federal
courts
should
properly
have
evoked
an
exclusionary
rule,
an
exclusionary
rule
pattern
not
on
the
basis
of
the
flexible
standard
the
government
suggests
but
rather
on
the
same
basis
as
the
exclusionary
rule
for
federal
officers.
after
all
california
has
found
that
rule
the
only
means
of
deterring
unlawful
searches
and
seizures
by
its
officers
--
its
officers,
so
of
20
other
states
so
of
the
federal
courts.
and
we
submit
that
interest
of
state
policy
required
a
different
result
seems
rather
far
fetched,
nor
cannot
be
said
if
we
accept
the
government's
change
in
emphasis
from
page
55
of
its
brief
where
it
said
the
disciplinary
effect
is
the
key
item
here
saying
other
elements
of
the
exclusionary
rule
at
precedent.
even
if
we
accept
this
to
be
the
fact,
we
submit
that
the
same
considerations
applying
for
adoption
of
the
exclusionary
rule
for
the
federal
courts,
likewise
apply
here.
after
all
if
office
--
let's
consider
officer
beckmann
is
going
to
do
next
time
he
seize
the
cab
and
let's
assume
the
lack
of
probable
cause.
perhaps
he
wasn't
aware
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine
when
he
seized
the
evidence
in
question
but
he
didn't
stop
at
the
state
courts,
he
took
the
evidence
to
the
federal
courts.
and
if
this
court
holds
that
that's
perfectly
proper,
one
can
well
wonder
what
officer
beckmann
is
going
to
do
the
next
time
he
seize
the
taxi
cab.
is
he
really
going
to
worry
about
the
exclusionary
rule
or
constitutional
problems
if
only
he
has
to
do
was
go
across
the
street
to
the
federal
court
house
and
introduce
his
evidence
and
get
the
prosecution
brought
to
a
conclusion
just
the
way
he
wants
it?
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no,
what
i
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
what
i
am
saying
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
this.
regardless
of
what
officer
beckmann's
intent
was
at
the
time
of
the
cross-examination
as
to
that
was
restricted,
at
the
present
time,
he
still
an
officer
of
los
angels
police
force
and
i'm
sure
he's
going
to
be
quite
aware
as
to
all
the
other
officers
on
the
various
state
police
forces
of
what
type
of
rule
this
court
lays
down.
and
if
this
court
lays
down
a
principle
under
which
a
conviction
he's
obtained
under
these
circumstances
is
sustained,
i
can
hardly
doubt
that
officer
beckmann,
the
next
time
he's
confronted
with
the
situation
of
this
sort,
is
going
to
take
the
silver
platter
doctrine
very
much
into
account,
so
of
his
fellow
officers.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
if
the
court
please,
if
in
fact,
he
believes
at
that
time
that
lack
of
probable
cause
is
not
the
criteria
but
there
is
some
lesser
standard,
he
certainly
isn't
going
to
operate
on
a
probable
cause
standard
if
that's
not
the
standard
that
the
federal
court
applies
in
determining
whether
the
evidence
is
admissible.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
but
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
we
don't
doubt
that
the
average
officer
in
the
state
in
the
federal
courts,
although
we
can't
read
their
minds,
perhaps
in
some
instances
believe
they
have
probable
cause,
perhaps
this
thought
never
enters
their
minds.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
the
question
of
probable
cause,
under
our
system,
is
something
for
the
courts
to
determine
not
for
the
officers
to
have
a
final
determination
on.
and
if
a
police
officer
--
officer
believes
that
all
you
need
for
probable
cause
for
example
is
the
fact
that
a
defendant
has
a
certain
colored
hair
or
a
certain
colored
stand
is
he
to
be
able
to
say
the
he
operated
in
good
faith,
because
this,
according
to
his
view,
was
probable
cause
or
is
the
court
going
to
say,
"no,
regardless
of
what
you
believe,
we
establish
the
standard
of
--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--
probable
cause".
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
in
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is
our
position
that
to
deter
--
that
police
officers
as
california
feels,
other
states,
and
as
the
federal
courts
felt
in
adopting
the
weeks'
principle
are
deterred
if
they
feel
that,
by
granting
evidence
illegally
or
without
lack
--
with
lack
of
probable
cause,
if
they
feel
that
in
doing
so,
they're
getting
evidence
that
will
not
be
admitted.
we
submit
that
to
that
extent,
and
that
is
certainly
a
basic
cornerstone
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
to
that
extent,
they
will
take
such
matters
into
account
in
the
future
or
else
we
submit
that
the
entire
theory
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
weeks
case
is
being
called
into
question.
we
think
that's
been
a
sound
rule
in
california
practice,
may
i
say
in
conclusion,
as
evidenced
in
our
brief
reveals
that
since
the
adoption
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
california,
in
the
cahan
case,
there's
been
a
marked
improvement
in
standards
and
we
think
that
if
the
federal
court
--
if
the
federal
police
agencies
are
encouraged
to
assist
the
states
in
this
effort
by
knowing
that
federal
prosecutions
would
be
interfered
with
this
if
they
don't,
that
even
further
progress
can
be
made.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
type
of
rule
which
this
court
should
encourage
and
that
we
submit
is
the
reason
for
adopting
the
rule
of
evidence
which
we
have
proposed
here.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
