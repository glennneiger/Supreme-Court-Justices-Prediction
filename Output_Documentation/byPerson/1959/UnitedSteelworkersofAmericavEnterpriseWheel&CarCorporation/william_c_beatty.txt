mr.
william
c.
beatty
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
courtroom.
i
hardly
think
because
i'm
replying
to
the
warrior
case.
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
facts
again
if
i
might
to
sort
of
bring
our
thinking
back
to
this
case.
now,
as
mr.
bredhoff
has
pointed
out
to
you,
this
was
a
contract
which
was
entered
into
on
april
5,
1956
to
terminate
at
midnight
on
april
4,
1957.
there
were
no
provisions
for
renewals
or
continuances
in
that
contract
clause.
and
--
and
he
has
also
indicated
that
article
iv
and
article
iii
of
the
agreement
are
key
sections
to
the
agreement
that
we
are
here
discussing.
article
iv
deals
with
unjust
suspension
or
peremptory
discharge
in
the
wording
of
the
contract.
article
iii
is
the
grievance
procedure,
the
four-step
grievance
procedure
ending
up
with
arbitration.
and
the
important
words
at
the
beginning
of
that
section
1,
differences
arising
as
to
meaning
and
application
of
the
provisions
of
the
agreement.
those
are
the
words
that
prefaced
the
entire
four-step
grievance
procedure
and
then
you
come
down
to
arbitration
as
your
final
step.
now,
as
mr.
bredhoff
has
told
you,
on
january
18th,
1957,
some
three
or
four
months
before
the
contract
was
to
expire,
their
grievance,
of
11
men
arose.
the
company
maintained
that
they
quit
their
position
and
therefore,
there
was
no
arbitrable
issue
involved.
and
at
the
time,
the
bargaining
unit
consisted
of
52
employees
and
that
was
about
the
extent
of
the
number
of
employees
that
enterprise
had.
they
had
a
--
a
couple
of
clerical
employees
in
the
office.
now,
arbitration
was
asked
for
and
finally,
the
company
denied
arbitration.
then,
the
contract
expired
in
april
1957
and
the
matter
arose
there
until
--
on
july
3rd,
1957,
unfair
labor
practice
charges
were
filed
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
maintaining
that
there
had
been
a
--
a
failure
to
bargain
and
also
that
there
had
been
a
discrimination
against
these
men
that
were
discharged.
the
complaint
was
refused
by
the
board,
not
sufficient
evidence
to
support
it,
on
august
12th
1957.
now,
this
was
in
the
time
when
lincoln
mills
sort
--
had
just
been
decided,
if
the
court
will
recall.
then
the
procedure
--
the
next
step
in
the
procedure
was
to
go
to
court.
now,
bear
in
mind,
that
it
is
our
position
here
that
that
contract
expired
absolutely.
there
was
no
new
agreement
entered
into.
the
arbitrator
in
his
--
what
he
denominates,
his
decision
on
award
and
a
little
prefatory
discussion
states
--
and
this
is
in
the
record,
2a
18,
this
is
in
appendix
record
made
up
of
two
sections
out
of
the
appendix
of
the
brief.
well,
he
states
that
there
was
no
new
contract,
a
union
counsel
in
colloquy
with
the
court,
in
one
of
these
proceedings,
admits
that
there
was
no
new
contract.
and
affidavits
filed
on
behalf
of
the
employee
--
employer
also
shows
that
there
was
no
new
contract
or
no
new
contractual
relationships
other
than
this,
that
the
men
apparently
had
--
had
gone
out
and
they
wanted
to
go
back
to
work
and
they
came
back,
and
the
company
agreed
to
take
them
back.
and
there
had
been
some
noted
negotiation
as
to
wages
and
the
company
anxiously
took
them
back
at
a
higher
wage
than
had
been
discussed
in
any
negotiation
as
to
the
--
enterprise
has
continued
to
operate
these
three
years
now
without
any
contract
with
the
union
at
all.
they
have
bargained
on
occasions
with
them
but
they
have
operated
without
contract
with
the
union.
now,
that's
--
that
gives
us
the
point
as
to
this
--
of
this
case
before
it
went
in
to
the
courts.
and
now,
in
august
of
1957,
an
action
was
brought
to
compel
specific
performance
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia,
asking
that
enterprise
be
compelled
to
comply
with
article
iii,
step
four
on
the
grievance
--
procedure.
a
hearing,
winding
up
in
the
summary
judgment
motion
determined
on
october
of
1957,
that
the
company
should
submit
to
arbitration.
now,
there
was
nothing
said
in
this
--
the
--
the
court
--
court
has
a
sort
of
a
memorandum
of
opinion,
t
wasn't
reported.
but
it
--
it
was
an
oral
opinion
that
was
delivered
from
the
--
the
bench
and
is
reported
here
in
the
--
in
the
record.
the
court
doesn't
discuss
anything
about
reinstatement
rights
going
beyond
the
period
of
the
contract.
now,
i
might
add
it
was
an
enterprise's
initial
position
after
the
arbitrator
made
his
award.
now,
the
arbitrator
said
this.
he
said,
"first,
you
must
reinstate
these
men."
now,
bear
in
mind,
his
--
his
award
came
in
april
--
april
10th
of
1958.
this
was
sometime
after
the
--
the
procedure.
and
i'm
not
talking
about
where
they
went
in
to
force
us
to
arbitrate,
i'm
just
getting
a
little
bit
ahead,
but
you
have
--
you
have
to
understand
that
our
position
has
been
that
the
arbitrator
said
that
there
could
be
reinstatement
after
the
period
of
the
contract.
that
the
men
would
get
lost
compensation
after
the
period
of
the
contract.
however,
that
would
be
subjected
to
a
offset
for
other
earnings
during
the
period.
and
the
enterprise
from
the
beginning
has
said
that
they
would
recognize
that
portion
of
the
award
up
to
the
termination
date
of
the
contract.
but
that
they
felt
that
the
arbitrator
had
exceeded
his
authority
and
had
gone
beyond
the
scope
of
that
contract
in
awarding
reinstatement
and
back
pay
beyond
the
period
of
the
contract.
now,
i'll
go
back
to
where
the
court
ordered
specific
performance
and
--
and
ordered
them
--
enterprise
to
arbitrate.
they
submitted
the
arbitration
and
it
was
held
on
january
3rd
of
1958.
and
then
in
april
--
april
10th,
1958,
the
award
was
made
and
that
the
decision
and
award
of
the
arbitrator
is
set
forth
in
the
record.
and
as
i
say,
it
constituted
the
matters
that
i
have
discussed
here
just
a
moment
ago.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
it
was.
april
4
was
the
expiration
date
and
the
district
court
proceeding
was
brought
in
august.some
four
months
i
believe
or
so
afterwards.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
the
date
of
the
award
was
april
10,
1958.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
oh,
and
--
and
much
over
a
year
after
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
that
question
was
raised,
i
think,
in
an
indirect
question.
i
--
i
didn't
appear
as
counsel
in
--
in
that
proceeding.
but
here
--
here
is
the
way
that
--
it
was
contended
first
that
--
as
--
as
i
read
it,
it
was
contended
that
the
men
quit
and
therefore,
there
was
no
arbitrable
issue.
and
it
was
also
said
that
even
if
they
--
they
--
they
did
quit,
it
was
an
unjust
--
i
mean
it
was
a
just
discharge
and
that
the
question
was
moot.
moot,
i
--
i
take
a
thing
that
the
contract
had
expired.
now,
nothing
specifically
was
said,
justice
brennan,
about
reinstatement
rights
or
money
going
beyond
the
period
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
i
--
i
believe
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
second
section.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
well,
i
--
i
don't
take
it
that
--
that
they
ever
specifically
said
that
it
might
have
been
embraced
in
that,
but
i
--
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
particularly
argued.
and
in
reading
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
court
ordering
arbitration,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
see
that
he
said
was
on
page
15.
let
me
see,
that
is
in
the
second
section
also.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
now,
this
is
the
first
opinion
of
the
district
court.
he
got
to
a
proposition
somewhat
similar
to
that.
i
think
it
was
raised
in
lincoln
mills.
the
fact
they
raised
--
they
raised
mootness
there
and
they
couldn't
make
these
accommodations
for
job
rights.
i
think
there
were
certain
provisions
in
there
that
they
had
to
make,
arrangements
for
seniority
in
that
sort
of
thing
as
i
recall
this
is
offhand.
but
what
the
court
did
say
there,
they
said,
"well,
it's
not
moot
as
to
monetary
damages."
and
the
district
court,
at
the
bottom
of
page
15,
i
quoted
that
language
from
--
from
lincoln
mills.
the
language
was,
insofar
as
--
this
is
a
quote
from
lincoln
mills,
"insofar
as
the
grievances
of
the
restoration
work
loads
and
jobs
assignments,
the
case
is
of
course
moot
but
to
the
extent
that
they
sought
a
monetary
award,
the
case
is
a
continuing
controversy."
now,
that's
about
all
but
i
can
see
in
there,
that
--
that
was
said
as
to
the
--
the
monetary
damages
or
the
--
the
remedy
that
--
that
they
might
have.
now,
as
--
as
i
was
--
was
saying
after
the
arbitration
award
occurred
--
now,
this
was
in
april
--
april
of
1958,
then
the
matter
lay
at
rest
there
and
--
until
all
november
of
1958.
and
then
a
show
cause
proceeding
was
brought.
now,
that's
the
second
proceeding
where
we
get
the
second
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
the
reported
opinion
of
the
district
court.
now,
in
the
show
cause
proceeding,
they
asked
the
--
the
company,
they
made
show
cause
while
they
should
not
comply
with
the
arbitrator's
award.
the
company
then
filed
what
it
denominated
as
its
answer
in
resistance
to
the
proceeding.
and
it
maintained
that
first,
that
there
was
lack
of
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
determine
this
matter
for
the
reason
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
westinghouse
salaried
employees
case.
the
--
the
theory
there
being,
and
this
is
not
at
issue
here,
but
it
is,
i
think,
important
to
see
the
background
of
the
case,
we
get
the
posture
of
it.
the
theory
there
being
that
it
was
a
right
that
was
peculiar
to
individual
employees
and
wasn't
a
right
that
the
union
have
to
assert.
then
in
--
in
the
alternative
to
the
merits,
the
company
raised
the
--
the
same
defenses
that
they
have
--
have
consistently
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
same
thing
virtually
that
we're
asserting
here.
the
first,
that
the
arbitrator
exceeded
the
scope
of
his
authority
in
going
beyond
the
termination
date
of
the
contract.
that
he
added
to
and
--
and
made
something
out
of
that
contract
that
wasn't
contemplated
by
the
parties.
then,
there
was
a
second
proposition
which
i
assume
has
managed
from
the
case
now.
and
that
--
that
was
that
the
award
was
not
found
in
detriment.
as
you
--
you
recall,
i
pointed
out
that
they
allowed
a
set
off
for
wages
that
--
in
other
words,
that
were
earned
in
the
outside.
the
arbitrator
did
that.
he
didn't
provide
any
particular
formula.
he
didn't
--
to
provide
any
particular
amount
and
i
don't
believe
any
evidence
was
taken
on
that
in
the
arbitration
proceeding.
so,
that
was
another
point
that
we
raised,
that
this
was
indefinite
type
of
award
and
under
our
theory
that
it
was
totally
void
and
there
should
--
therefore,
should
be
set
aside.
now,
we
argued
before
the
district
court
as
well
as
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
entire
thing
was
void
and
should
be
set
aside.
now,
after
that,
the
district
court
decided
that
he
did
have
jurisdiction
of
the
matter,
that
we
should
comply
with
the
award
and
ordered
compliance.
and
then
we
took
a
time,
we
appealed
to
the
--
the
court
of
appeals.
and
before
the
court
of
appeals,
we
made
substantially
the
same
argument
that
we
made
before
the
--
the
lower
court.
and
we
came
up
with
this
result,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
award
did
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
the
arbitrator.
that
the
award,
insofar
as
it
allow
the
monitory
compensation
after
the
termination
day
of
the
contract
should
be
stricken
down,
the
reinstatement
should
be
stricken
down
and
that
the
enterprise
should
pay
for
the
time
lost
during
the
period
of
the
contract.
and
also,
the
court
said
that
--
that
it
was
indefinite
in
the
sense
that
there
were
no
criteria
to
mathematically
calculate
how
these
awards,
how
--
how
these
offset
of
compensation
should
be
determined.
and
we
have
pointed
out
that,
like
the
national
labor
relations
board
uses
a
quarterly
system
for
example,
taking
in
on
a
three
month
average.
and
there
is
a
possibility
of
offsetting
wages
earned
over
the
total
period
against
the
total
--
i
mean
the
--
wages
earned
outside
over
the
total
period
against
wages
that
could
have
been
earned
with
the
company
during
the
total
period.
and
--
and
there's
other
ways
of
--
of
computing
this.
the
court
said
there
that
it
should
go
back
to
arbitration,
to
--
to
be
determined.
now,
what
the
court
did
at
all
times
here,
the
court
was
familiar
with
the
lincoln
mills
decision.
and
it
was
attempting
to
protect
as
much
of
this
award
as
it
possibly
could.
it
was
showing
deference
to
the
arbitrator's
award.
we
didn't
contest
the
merits
that
the
--
that
the
discharge
--
and
once
the
--
the
arbitrator
said
that
the
discharge
had
been
too
severe
a
penalty,
we
didn't
contest
that.
now,
and
--
and
bear
in
mind
too
that
the
arbitrator
said
that
while
penalty
of
discharge
was
too
severe,
he
said
he
did
think
the
men
were
wrong
in
walking
out
and
not
taking
their
--
a
grievance
to
the
grievance
procedure
and
therefore,
he
would
apply
a
10-day
suspension.
in
--
in
other
words,
the
company
would
get
credit
for
10
days,
but
those
men
should
have
been
disciplined.
so,
this
wasn't
a
--
a
discriminatory
type
claim
on
the
part
of
the
company
in
the
arbitrator
so
--
so
recognized
that.
the
court
of
appeals
then
attempted
to
protect
this
award
and
showed
deference
to
it.
they
didn't
attempt
to
go
into
the
merits
of
the
situation
and
offset
what
he
held
about
the
discharge
or
go
into
the
evidence
in
any
manner
and
we
didn't
contest
that.
the
only
thing
that
we
contested
was
what
went
beyond
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
now,
i
--
i
--
my
opinion,
justice
brennan
is
--
and
it
was
based
upon
our
argument
dealing
with,
first
--
and
i
--
i
will
go
into
that
but
i'll
answer
the
question
right
now
anyway,
and
go
into
it
in
a
little
more
detail
in
a
minute.
what
happened
there
was,
we
had
argued
first
that
in
an
arbitration
agreement,
when
you
go
beyond
the
scope
of
authority,
it's
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
have
gone
beyond
the
scope
of
the
--
of
authority
of
the
contract.
there
is
good
arbitration
law
to
that
effect
not
only
in
commercial
arbitration
but
in
labor
arbitrations
particularly
under
the
arbitration
act.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
i
don't
think
that
they
relied
upon
any
specific
--
i
--
i
can't
say
that.
they
--
i
don't
say
that
in
--
in
their
opinion
and
they
didn't
discuss
that
length
which
in
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
well,
the
only
thing
that
i
would
say
is
that
you
remember
the
language
that
i
pointed
out,
meaning
and
applications
of
the
provisions
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
--
of
the
agreement.
now,
that
is
what
i
would
say
limits
the
arbitrator
in
going
beyond
the
scope
of
his
authority
and
gives
the
court
the
right
to
agree
to
the
final
tribunal
on
it,
so
to
speak.
now,
that
that
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
well
for
one
thing
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
well,
the
union
says,
i
mean
they
make
that
an
issue.
yes,
sir.
they
do.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
but
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
i
refer
--
i
mean
everybody
has
referred
it
to
professor
cox.
then
i
--
i've
got
my
version
of
it
too.
if
you'll
recall,
professor
cox
points
out
that
in
--
and
i
think
this
is
a
--
a
good
analogy.
he
says
that
type
of
cause
does
not
mean
an
arbitrator
can
lift
himself
up
by
his
bootstraps.
that
he's
limited
to
things
that
were
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
so
to
speak.
otherwise
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
sure.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
and
it
comes
down
to
what
we
argue.
we
say
that
it's
a
question
here
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
within
the
scope
of
authority.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
of
course,
we
say
that
the
court
must
determine
it.
in
our
discussion
of
the
brief,
we
have
discussed
that
particular
point
and
we
follow
--
we
take
the
view
that
that
language
doesn't
give
the
arbitrators
supreme
power.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
otherwise
you
--
you're
left
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
well,
you'll
have
a
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
--
clear
cut
situation,
certainly.
but
i
still
say
that
in
this
situation,
i
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
our
situation
is
that
though.
although
it's
not
as
clear
cut
in
the
terms
that
you
--
as
you
say
it.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
sir,
i
don't
think
under
the
general
arbitration
that
--
i'll
admit
that
you
could
so
word
it
to
say
he
is
absolutely
supreme
but
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
but
under
a
clause
like
we've
got,
i
don't
think
that
you
--
you
can
say
that.
that
--
that
the
--
i
think,
the
court
has
to
be
the
final
determiner
here.
otherwise,
in
all
these
conventional
type
arbitration
agreements,
you
will
let
--
well,
you're
at
the
--
at
the
mercy
of
the
arbitrator
and
what
his
conscience
says.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
i
might
add,
justice
frankfurter,
that,
there
is
the
provision
in
here.
this
contract
is
limited
to
one
year
and
certainly,
when
he
goes
beyond
that
one
year
period,
he
has
added
something
to
that
contract.
it's
not
fair
and
he
does
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
of
course,
this
is
a
private
contract
and
you're
dealing
with
public
law.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
for
this
reason.
you
still
had
the
question
of
monetary
damages
within
the
contract
period.
the
entire
issue
wasn't
moot.
and
we
all
know
that
we
litigate
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
--
reaches
the
period,
isn't
it?
mr.
william
c.
beatty
well
there,
we
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
no,
sir.
but
it
--
it
was
on
a
valid
grievance
that
--
that
existed.
there
--
there
was
that
much
out
of
there.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
because
the
parties
agreed
that
the
terms
of
this
contact
should
be
and
only
in
effect
for
one
year.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
well,
i
don't
think
there
was
--
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
in
--
in
this
record
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
--
and
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
it
--
it
--
in
that
there's
a
--
as
of
the
contract
period
and
the
evidence
show
--
shows
that
in
the
record.
i
might
add
that
in
my
opinion,
too,
i
don't
think
that
the
arbitrator
stuck
specifically
to
the
language
of
this
contract.
i
think
that
he
--
he
went
off
on
a
--
say
what
you
will,
a
mistaken
interpretation
but
he
said
something
to
the
effect
that
there
was
continuing
rights
under
law
for
these
people
not
to
be
discharged
except
for
discrimination
and
without
cause.
in
other
words,
under
law,
he
didn't
say
under
the
contract
after
the
expiration
date.
now,
this
is
in
his
award,
he
says
that
they
were
protected
by
law
from
unjust
faring.
well,
now,
the
law
if
there's
no
contract,
doesn't
protect
against
the
unjust
faring,
it
protects
against
the
discrimination
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
but
that
is
not
so
here,
we
don't
have
that
problem.
i
mean
that's
--
that's
out
of
this
case.
the
--
the
point
being
that
after
this
contract
terminated,
this
men
or
anybody
that
continued
could
have
been
discharged
if
they
didn't
like
the
color
of
their
hair.
now,
that
might
be
taking
the
--
i
mean
the
most
harsh
example
of
it
but
certainly,
the
employer
did
not
have
limitations
imposed
upon
him
by
any
contract
and
he
could
fire
or
hire
as
he
please.
and
i
think
that
the
arbitrator
at
least
his
decision
of
award
on
--
that's
23
in
the
second
part
of
the
record,
hence,
to
indicate
that
he
wasn't
relying
upon
the
specific
language
of
the
contract,
that
he
was
relying
upon
some
sort
of
mistaken
interpretation
that
the
law
gave
--
gave
these
men
rights
after
the
contract
had
terminated,
which
it
did
not.
and
we
know
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
this
case.
now,
i
might
go
in
to
a
few
of
the
principles
that
we
relied
upon
before
the
--
but
first,
i
would
like
to
--
like
to
discuss
this
with
the
court.
we
feel
that
this
is
the
area
that
has
not
been
marked
off
for
industrial
jurisprudence
of
the
law
of
the
shops
so
to
speak.
this
is
the
thing
where
you
deal
with
the
bargain
and
exchange.
we're
--
the
functional
aspects
of
the
contract
here
are
much
the
same
as
in
any
other
kind
of
contract.
now,
you
can
say
there
are
such
things
in
ordinary
contract
which
i
seriously
doubt
if
there
is.
but
certainly,
there
are
principles
that
apply
to
trust
and
dentures,
requirements,
contracts,
the
sale
of
real
estate
in
the
--
the
functional
area
of
bargain
and
exchange
that
would
apply
to
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
here,
we're
--
we're
in
the
area
now
of
attempting
to
determine
what
these
people
bargained
for.
and
we're
in
that
area
where
professor
cox
says,
"the
imperative
which
requires
a
body
of
industrial
jurisprudence
within
the
general
area
worked
off
for
joint
government,
has
no
place
in
deciding
what
area
has
been
marked
off."
then
we
find
that
the
problem
is
to
be
solved
by
general
principles,
attempting
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
can
remake
a
contract
that's
been
entered
into
between
the
parties.
in
the
general
arbitration
field
--
now,
this
is
where
we
get
into
the
cases
that
we
discussed
before
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
general
arbitration
field,
the
arbitrator
has
long
been
prohibited
from
remaking
a
contract
for
imposing
additional
burdens
upon
the
parties.
there's
certainly
--
i
don't
think
any
question
about
that
and
the
union
doesn't
question
the
fact
that
i
don't
think
anyone
that
justice
frankfurter
points
out
here,
that
if
you
go
beyond
the
scope,
why
you
can
--
the
award
becomes
invalid.
the
union
doesn't
question
that
now.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
the
--
the
general
law
of
arbitration
has
been
to
that
effect,
state
decisions,
arbitration
decisions
on
down
the
line.
if
you
go
beyond
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
as
reflected
in
the
contract,
you
obviously
exceed
your
jurisdiction.
the
fact
that
there
is
language
in
the
contract
to
the
effect
that
it
shall
be
final
and
binding,
doesn't
mean
that
that
completely
bars
you
from
going
into
a
court,
it
just
merely
means
that
it's
the
things
within
the
submission
or
within
the
scope
you
are
bound,
the
res
judicata
within
the
agreement
so
to
speak,
if
you
have
the
jurisdiction
or
the
authority.
they
--
they
make
some
--
some
--
something
to
do
of
that
language
but
we
say
that
that's
all
that
language
means
and
the
cases
so
hold.
now,
we
had
a
contract
here
that
was
not
renewed
or
no
new
contract
came
up.
all
--
all
rights
stem
from
the
contract
and
these
people
were
protected
to
april
4
of
1957.
then
you
look
to
some
of
the
general
law
recording
what
--
collective
bargaining
contracts.
and
you'll
find
that
it's
--
the
damages
for
wrongful
discharge
under
a
collective
bargaining
contract
are
limited
to
the
earliest
date
when
an
employee
can
be
lawfully
discharged.there's
a
substantial
authority
for
that.
the
recovery
is
limited
to
the
--
to
the
date
of
the
contract
termination
and
there
is
none
after
the
time
that
it
could
be
effectively
determinated.
it
said
that
collective
bargaining
agreements,
don't
create
a
permanent
status
and
they
don't
give
an
indefinite
tenure
or
the
extend
rights
created
and
arising
under
a
contract
beyond
its
life
when
it's
terminated.
in
our
--
we
cited
the
system
federation
case
which
was
a
court
of
appeals
decision
from
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
--
has
some
of
the
similar
attributes
of
this
case.
and
at
page
39
of
our
brief,
there's
extensive
language
set
out
from
that
case.
on
page
39
particularly,
in
italics,
there's
this
language
that
dealt
with
the
situation
where
a
man
had
been
furloughed
within
the
period
of
one
contract,
wrongfully
furloughed.
and
after
the
contract
had
expired,
they
asked
for
a
reinstatement
and
back
wages.
and
the
court
had
this
to
say.
they
said
they
could
not
because
the
contract
had
been
breached
as
to
them.
claim
that
the
breach
had
extended
its
life
so
as
to
entitle
them
to
time
lost
and
reinstatement
after
its
abrogation.
we
--
we
insist
that
that
is
true
here.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
that
we
don't
believe
that
even
if
you
say
that
you
must
rely
on
this
language
regarding
interpretation,
we
point
out
that
this
was
the
--
was
not
a
broad
arbitration
clause
saying
that
any
and
all
dispute
shall
be
subjected
to
arbitration.this
was
the
narrow-type
clause.
it's
the
conventional-type
clause.
the
union
has
called
it
a
broad
clause.
i
believe
that
maybe
it's
a
difference
in
terminology
but
i
call
it
a
narrow
clause
in
the
sense
that
it
doesn't
allow
the
arbitrator
the
right
to
determine
his
own
authority.
not
only
that
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
court
has
--
has
the
ultimate
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
have
stayed
within
the
scope
is
his
authority.
now,
i
might
add
that
i
don't
think
that
he
would
have
found
any
practice
to
that.i
mean
i
realized
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
i
realized
that
you
have
posed
a
hypothetical
question.
but
our
research
certainly
didn't
reveal
it.
and
the
union
came
up
with
one
arbitration
provision
where
they
did
that
and
they
want
upon
some
continuing
rights
theory
about
the
--
you
had
assume
that
the
men
would
continue
employment,
in
that
sort
of
thing.
but
i
would
say
that
the
--
the
court
has
--
the
court
is
the
final
determiner
of
--
of
whether
or
not
it
was
within
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
the
contract.
now,
we
also
point
out
that
--
as
i
pointed
to
the
recital
in
the
decision
and
award
and
reemphasized
that
that
we
did
not
or
we
don't
believe
that
the
arbitrators
specifically
relied
upon
determined
of
--
of
the
terms
of
the
contract.
he
didn't
say
that
this
contract
term
gives
me
the
privilege
or
the
right
of
doing
this.and
as
i
said,
he
relied
upon
something
beyond
that
contract.
now,
i
might
add
here
that
the
union
does
not
contest
the
fact
that
if
we
so
desired
that
we
could
take
these
men
back
and
fire
them
immediately.
they
--
they
admitted
to
that
before
the
district
court
in
the
colloquy
between
the
court
and
counsel,
believe
i
can
put
my
finger
on
it
in
just
a
second
here.
that's
in
the
first
portion
of
the
--
of
the
record.
before
it
asked
--
i
don't
--
now,
let's
see.
this
is
on
22
down
about
midway
of
the
page,
"as
i
understand
their
contention
or
any
fact
admittedly,
there
was
no
written
agreement.
he
did
not
contend
that
this
other
agreement
continued
beyond
april
of
1957
as
i
understand
you"
"no,
sir,
the
old
agreement
did
not."
"let
me
ask
you
this,
you
take
the
position
then
that
the
company's
way
of
getting
out
of
this
dilemma
is
to
first
reinstate
him,
the
--
the
contract
was
entered.
you
don't
contest
the
fact
that
the
company
could
discharge
him
the
date
of
the
reinstatement?"
"no,
sir,
i
do
not."
so
it
--
it
seems
that
you're
arguing
about
something
here
that
they
even
admit
that
you
don't
have
to
do.
in
other
words,
you
take
them
back
and
you've
got
the
right
to
discharge
him
immediately.
and
certainly,
all
through
this
proceeding
but
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
that's
--
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
--
that
--
that
has
been
my
(voice
overlap).
let
--
let
me
point
out
this,
there
--
there
was
this
distinction.
i
argued
that
the
whole
thing
was
invalid
and
void.
it
should
be
set
aside
by
reason
of
this
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
advanced.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"no,
we'll
separate
the
valid
from
the
invalid
portion
of
award."
and
what
you
stated
was
what
they
recognized
to
be
the
valid
portion
of
the
award
and
they
said,
"we
will
--
we
will
grant
that."
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
we
aren't
investing
that
now
that
the
claim
was
invalid
and
void.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
that's
exactly
so,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
would
say
that
--
as
i
said
before,
it's
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
gone
--
gone
to
the
scope
of
his
authority.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
of
course,
i
can't
conceive
of
a
situation
where
--
where
you're
going
to
order
them
back
to
work
when
they've
got
the
right
to
--
i
say,
i
can't
conceive.
i
don't
mean
that,
i
mean
the
situations
here.
i
mean
that's
a
misnomer
in
language.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that's
--
in
--
in
my
opinion,
i
can't
see
how
they
can
order
reinstatement
when,
yet
they
admit
that
immediately,
you
could
discharge
these
men
and
also
look
at
the
position
of
those
men
that
continued
on
in
work.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
of
course,
you're
dealing
on
something
more
than
that.
you're
giving
them
damages
over
a
two
or
three
period
--
two
or
three-year
period
say,
after
the
expiration
date
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
oh,
no
--
no,
sir.
i
mean
that
if
--
if
you
follow
the
union
into
that
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
practically,
i
would
say
that
is
true.
and
they
got
what,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
all
that
their
contract
had
provided
for.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
of
course,
we're
getting
back
in
to
what
we
call
the
law
of
the
shop.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
or
well
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
(voice
overlap)
the
shop
to
develop
by
--
in
labor
disputes.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
and
that's
right.
i
was
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
that's
right,
sir.
and
i
--
i
agree
that
the
law
of
--
of
--
of
labor
jurisprudence
has
a
place.
but
it
also
has
--
has
an
area
that's
marked
off
for
it.
and
we
say
here
that
this
is
not
the
area
that
this
is
the
--
the
place
to
bargain
and
exchange
where
courts
have
looked
at
--
at
contracts
for
years
to
determine
what
the
--
the
parties
bargained
for
and
that's
the
area
that
we're
operating
in
here.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
no.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
they
can
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
well,
that's
not
--
not
--
i
--
i
will
agree
with
that
because
i
don't
say
it's
a
complete
isolated
system,
isolating
the
courts
completely
from
it.
there
are
contentions
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
well,
i
think
it
is
a
vital
factor,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
true
and
--
and
of
course,
we
say
here
though
that
--
that
actually
after
you
look
at
that,
that
you
come
back
to
the
situation
you
find
if
you're
in
the
area
where
the
functional
aspects
of
other
kind
of
contracts
are
the
same
as
this.
now,
that
--
that's
what
we
--
we
say
here
after
you
look
at
this
labor
jurisprudence
that
you
come
down
to
the
situation
where
it
doesn't
apply.
there
is
no
spatial
knowledge
of
the
arbitrator
that
enables
him
any
better
than
the
court
to
--
to
reach
conclusion
on
--
on
this
--
this
type
of
subject.
i
--
i
might
--
might
add
too
that
--
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
i
don't
think
they
would
except
that
they
couldn't
be
discharged
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
reason.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
that's
right,
sir.
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
beatty
and
we've
also
--
we're
--
we're
in
this
position,
too.
we
haven't
--
i
mean
we
have
consistently
said
but
we
don't
go
over
the
--
we
don't
have
to
take
them
back.
now,
at
some
place
along
the
line
even
if
you
take
the
view
that
--
that
they
had
to
be
in
--
reinstated
over
this
long
interim
period,
after
the
contract
expired.
certainly,
we
had
a
right
to
terminate
them
during
that
period.
and
there's
been
a
manifestation
of
that
right,
that
many
occasions
along
here.
so,
you
--
you
have
that
problem
of
--
of
when
do
these
rights
cut
off.
and
certainly,
we
say
that
the
union
says,
we
haven't
specifically
fire
a
number
and
we
said
we
don't
want
them
back
but
we've
done
everything
but
write
a
notice
to
that
effect
even
though
you
would
say
that
--
that
the
--
the
arbitrator
was
correct.
we
have
manifested
an
intention
that
we
did
want
them
after
the
expiration
date
of
the
contract.
and
that
has
been
discussed
somewhat
in
--
there
has
been
no
allusion
in
oral
argument
to
that,
but
in
the
references
to
the
(inaudible)
case
by
the
union
in
its
brief
which
we
feel
--
we
feel
(inaudible)
is
not
controlling
here
because
it
had
a
national
security
overtones,
and
it
was
pointed
at
protecting
individual
rights
in
a
grave
referring
problem.
it's
not
--
it's
not
this
type
of
thing
where
we're
dealing
with
--
with
contract
rights.
there,
the
court
was
faced
evidently
with
the
--
the
problem
of
removing
what
a
man
called
a
"badge
of
infamy"
that
it
had
been
attached
to
you.
and
they
felt
that
that
case,
the
--
the
way
they
reached
the
conclusion
was
to
give
rights
back
to
a
man,
that
had
been
taken
away
from
in
procedurally
and
so
forth.
we
do
not
feel
that
that
case
controls
and
i
might
add
that
in
closing,
that
we
don't
feel
that
there
has
been
--
there
is
any
overall
arm
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
find
that
what
has
been
done
here
does
not
conflict
and
it
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
national
labor
policy.
the
union
have
--
has
not
made
mention
of
that
in
their
opening
statement
but
i
did
want
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
enclose
that
we
do
not
feel
that
the
labor
processes
are
being
impinged
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
and
as
we
earlier
pointed
out,
the
court
attempted
to
provide
and
protect,
provide
for
and
protect
that
arbitration
award
by
separating
the
valid
from
the
invalid
and
following
the
later
cases
to
that
effect,
that
if
you
can't
separate
the
valid
from
the
invalid
portion
of
award,
then
you
may
so
do
and
say
that
this
--
this
is
a
valid
portion
and
we'll
just
strike
down
the
invalid
portion
and
not
the
entire
award.
it
was
entirely
consistent
with
lincoln
mills
and
with
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
lincoln
mills
to
use
their
judicial
inventiveness
to
--
looking
at
--
at
the
federal
law,
the
--
a
number
of
express
statutory
mandate
and
so
forth.
and
to
attempt
to
come
forth
with
some
sort
of
national
law
and
collective
bargaining
contracts.
there
is
nothing,
we
submit,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
result
that
was
obtained
that
is
inconsistent
with
that
national
labor
policy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
an
attempt
to
follow
the
--
the
path
or
the
pioneering
path
that
had
been
setup
for
those
course
to
follow
and
to
protect
that
award
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
following
principles
of
arbitration
law
and
not
in
a
posit
principles
adopted
from
contract
law
but
a
posit
principles
adopting
them
over
into
this
field
and
coming
forth
with
the
result
which
it
had.
it
has
been
--
and
there
--
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
money
involved
even
in
the
award
in
--
in
giving
money
up
until
the
time
that
the
contract
expires.
now,
something
has
been
made
of
the
policy
or
i
mean
from
the
policy
aspect.
the
union
makes
the
argument
that
here,
you're
going
to
let
the
employer
get
away
with
something
that
he's
going
to
be
able
for
the
--
the
arbitration
procedure
by
being
able
to
delay
arbitration
until
the
expiration
of
a
contract.
now,
that
is
not
so,
because
he
is
faced
with,
one,
his
great
economic
sanction.
no
employer
is
going
to
deliberately
let
a
contract
rise
with
the
idea
of
saying
it's
not
arbitrable
and
allow
damages
to
accrue
during
the
period
of
the
contract
against
him.
secondly,
he's
got
the
economic
pressure
of
a
strike
stream
in
the
place.
and
certainly,
if
--
if
he
doesn't
comply
with
this
contract,
he's
got
back
the
content
with
and
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
said
that
any
reasonable
employer
is
going
to
sit
back
and
just
dream
up
excuses
purporting
this
type
of
contract.
we
don't
feel
that
this
will
impede
arbitration.
well,
i
might
add
that
certainly
if
it
is
determined
that
under
one
of
this
conventional
type
clauses,
that
the
court
does
not
or
is
not
the
final
determinant
of
whether
or
not
the
arbitrator
is
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority.
now,
this
is
all
the
conventional
clause
and
there's
going
to
be
a
many
--
of
an
employer
before
he
had
something
that
he
did
not
have.
and
that
it
is
going
to,
i
would
say,
fourth
arbitration
to
the
extent
that
there
will
be
many
devises,
or
attempts
to
develop
devises
to
avoid
arbitration
altogether
or
to,
at
least
limit
it
to
an
extent
that
perhaps
might
not
be
good
if
it
encroaches
upon
this
area
of
industrial
jurisprudence
they
were
speaking
of.
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
for
its
indulgence.
and,
gentlemen,
it's
been
a
pleasure
appearing
before
you.
thank
you
so
much.
