mr.
david
e.
feller
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
little
has
to
be
said
in
rebuttal
on
this
particular
case.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
contract
has
a
language
dealing
with
what
happens
as
mr.
bredhoff
pointed
out,
when
you
discharge
a
man
without
just
cause.
now,
mr.
beatty
in
his
brief
says,
we
point
out
what
a
terrible
situation
this
would
be
because
labor
contracts
are
always
for
discrete
intervals.
and
we
said
what
a
terrible
fix
if
a
union
would
be
in
it.
an
arbitrator
didn't
have
the
authority
to
find
that
there
was
an
obligation
to
reinstate.
and
he
said,
"if
you
wanted
to
provide
in
an
agreement
that
if
a
man
was
discharged
during
the
term
of
that
agreement,
an
arbitrator
could
after
the
term
order
him
reinstated,
why
--
why
didn't
you
provide
it?"
and
of
course,
that
is
precisely
what
the
arbitrator
said
was
provided
in
this
agreement.
the
arbitrator
construed
and
he
read
one
paragraph
in
the
arbitrator's
opinion.
the
arbitrator's
says
--
say,
language
is
--
is
--
on
page
23
and
the
second
part
of
the
record.
mr.
david
e.
feller
page
23,
in
the
lighter
print,
in
the
back
--
back
part.
he
discussed
the
law
in
coming
to
a
conclusion
as
bearing
on
this
conclusion
on
this
agreement.
and
he
says,
"article
iv
of
the
agreement."
i'm
not
talking
about
the
agreement,
"imposes
an
unconditional
obligation
on
the
company
to
compensate
an
employee
wrongfully
discharged
or
suspended
for
time
lost."
in
other
words,
he
said,
"that
is
not
conditioned,
that
obligation
is
not
conditioned
by
the
termination."
that's
the
way
he
construed
that
agreement.
he
didn't
reach
out
to
the
air
and
he
faced
it
on
article
iv
of
the
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
article
iv
is
--
you
will
find,
your
honor,
on
page
--
turn
over
the
earlier
pagination.
the
critical
language
at
the
top
of
page
18
--
top
of
page
18
in
the
--
the
yellower
paper
of
the
record.
at
the
top
of
page
18
is
the
critical
language
from
article
iv,
that's
the
suspension
and
discharge.
"should
it
be
determined
by
the
company
or
by
an
arbitrator
in
accordance
with
a
grievance
procedure
that
the
employee
has
been
suspended
unjustly
or
discharged
in
violation
of
the
agreement,
the
company
shall
reinstate
the
employee."
now,
he
construed
that
provision.
he
construed,
the
arbitrator
construed
that
provision
as
requiring
the
employer
to
reinstate
this
man
even
after
the
contract
had
expired.
and
he
was
doing
his
job
of
interpreting
and
implying
the
agreement.
he
certainly
--
what
mr.
beatty
says,
as
he's
got
no
right
to
interpret
that
clause
of
the
agreement.
he
exempts
that
clause
from
the
total
agreement
which
the
arbitrator
has
given
authority
to
interpret
in
the
plot.
and
i'd
simply
don't
know
of
the
basis.
i
like
to
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question,
which
implied
--
but
really
that
goes
to
mr.
beatty's
argument
which
is
based
on
the
law
of
damages.
that
damages
run
to
the
end
of
a
contract.
the
argument
that
after
all
--
this
is
kind
of
silly
if
you
say
you'd
have
to
reinstate
him
but
the
employer
can
fire
him.
well,
maybe
the
parties
wrote
a
silly
contract.
the
arbitrator
said
that's
the
contract
and
you
have
to
reinstate.
as
a
practical
matter,
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
court
is
a
judge
on
that,
the
arbitrator
maybe,
that's
not
very
silly.
reinstating
a
man
and
then
fire
him
has
a
far
different
consequence
in
the
industrial
field,
industrial
relationship.
they're
not
reinstating
him
and
just
giving
him
some
money.
the
requirement
which
the
arbitrator
found
in
his
agreement
that
you
reinstated,
it
maybe
that
you
can
then
fire
him
if
there
is
no
new
contracts.
but
what
will
happen
in
your
plan,
it
would
be
far
different
--
if
you
didn't
reinstate.
the
point
is
and
--
and
let
me
say
that
the
incredible
thing
is
that
this
question
--
we've
just
been
through
the
american
manufacturing
case.
nobody
ever
suggested
there
that
sparks
didn't
have
a
good
grievance
for
reinstatement.
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
which
the
court
below
refer,
if
your
honors
will
remember
in
that
case,
the
question
involved
work
loads,
how
many
spindles
a
man
have
to
operate.
in
the
textile
mills,
the
grievance
was
filed
right
at
the
very
end
of
the
contract
and
the
question
came
here
--
and
nobody
said
it
was
moot
because
the
contract
expired
and
there
wasn't
no
newer.
what
they
said
was
it
was
moot
because
the
plant
shut
down.
and
therefore,
it
became
immaterial
what
the
spindles
was,
and
the
court
said
"well,
if
the
plant
shut
down."
the
opinion
of
the
court
said,
"that
would
make
the
question
of
the
work
assignments
moot
but
then,
you
have
the
damage
question
which
sustained,
but
nobody
suggested
that
because
the
contract
terminated,
the
obligation
to
make
good,
to
do
what
you
should
have
done
during
the
contract
term
didn't
continue.
what
this
employer
should
have
done,
what
he
is
required
to
do
under
the
contract
is
reinstate
these
people,
not
pay
damages.
there's
no
--
this
is
not
a
contract
for
damages.
the
contract
says,
"if
you
discharge
this
man
wrongfully,
then
reinstate
him."
and
that
right
vested
at
the
time
during
the
controversy.
the
arbitrator
found
something.
and
he
found
that
not
having
complied
with
that
obligation,
the
employer
had
a
continuing
obligation
to
reinstate
him.
of
course,
the
back
pay
run
along
but
that's
employer's
fault
not
our
fault.
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
then
people
would
never
have
been
fired
in
the
first
place,
or
would
have
been
reinstated
when
we
asked
them
to
be
reinstated.
but
if
he
wants
to
drag
us
through
litigation
twice
to
enforce
arbitration
in
the
first
place
and
--
and
force
compliance
to
the
award
in
the
second
place,
he
manufactures
his
own
problems
which
are
not
damages,
strictly
speaking
but
reinstated.
now,
i
want
to
advert
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
left
to
the
problems
which
were
raised
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
--
deal
with
mr.
--
or
argument
with
mr.
bredhoff.
i
think,
we
have
made
our
position
clear
and
i
think
there
may
have
been
an
inadvertent
response
to
a
question.
but
--
but
the
question
which
we've
made,
and
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
where
he
said,
"could
you
not
write
the
agreements
so
that
there'll
no
--
be
no
question
for
the
court?"
obviously,
you
could
right
an
agreement,
so
there's
no
question
to
report.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
that
depends
on
what
kind
of
arbitration
agreement
you
--
you
write.
you
can
write
a
broad
arbitration
agreement,
a
narrow
arbitration
agreement,
an
agreement
which
limits
arbitration
to
discharges.
there
are
such
cases
saying
the
only
thing
that
can
be
subject
with
--
the
arbitration
is
discharges
and
you
negotiate.
one
of
the
issues
in
collective
bargaining
very
often
is,
"what
shall
be
the
scope
of
arbitration?"
the
strike
in
henderson,
north
carolina
textile
workers
where
it
had
been
described,
was
about
the
issue
of
the
scope
of
arbitration,
where
there
should
be
arbitration.
you
can
have
strikes
about
that.
but
our
point
in
warrior
&
gulf
was
that
none
of
the
negotiating
--
none
of
the
evidence
put
in
dealt
with
any
negotiation
about
the
arbitration
clause
but
dealt
with
managements
rights
to
contract
and
the
subcontract.
and
that
we
said
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
arbitration
clause
which
have
been
in
the
contract
for
years.
and
what
you
are
arguing
and
introducing
what
the
court
relied
on
to
find
out
the
grievance
was
not
arbitrable,
wasn't
the
grievance
in
substance
was
no
good
because
of
negotiating
history.
and
we
said
that
was
improper
and,
mr.
lang's
in
this
court
to
convert
evidence
dealing
with
a
proposal
for
this
section
to
the
contrary
fact
into
--
import
them
through
that
door
and
say
every
--
really
amounts
to
saying,
every
bit
of
negotiating
history
as
to
the
substance
of
the
contract,
merely
relates
to
the
arbitration
provision
because
if
it's
clear
to
be
--
a
grievance
wouldn't
be
no
good.
then
it
won't
be
arbitrable
and
therefore,
it
limits
the
arbitration
clause.
and
of
course,
we
never
argue
and
never
conceded
that
that
kind
of
evidence
was
either
competent
or
material
or
relevant
to
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
--
i
frankly
vested
the
question
of
parole
evidence,
rule
in
the
rules
of
evidence,
i
do
not
pretend
to
give
an
answer
one
way
or
another.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it
would
be
relevant,
it
would
clearly
be
relevant
if
you
sought
to
arbitrate
something
which
clearly
--
well,
let
--
let
me
--
i
can
--
i
don't
like
to
give
abstract
answer.
let
me
give
you
a
concrete
answer.
we
have
the
automobile
worker's
contract
say,
"questions
of
production
standards
be
to
the
line
shall
not
be
subject
to
arbitration."
and
they've
excluded
this
from
the
process.
that's
very
important
to
them
to
exclude
it
from
the
process.
now,
then
the
question
is,
if
there
were
extrinsic
evidence
to
deal
with
the
--
what
the
parties
meant
when
they
excluded
that
from
the
arbitration
provision,
would
that
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
the
grievance
is
an
arbitrable
one
from
the
courts.
you
--
i
think
it
would
be
relevant.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
get
in
to
the
question
of
parole
evidence
rule
and
whether
you
go
behind
the
contract.
but
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
then,
the
evidence
which
is
involved
in
warrior
&
gulf
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
do
not
know
of
a
case.
under
our
arbitrability
cases
in
the
federal
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
new
york
courts,
i
do
not
know
of
a
case
when
anybody
has
ever
really
brought
in
that
kind
of
evidence.
that's
--
that
kind
of
--
they
always
bring
in
evidence
as
to
the
dispute.
and
they
say,
"well,
when
we
agreed
that
the
employer
would
have
this
right,
what
we
meant
was
that
it
wouldn't
be
arbitrable."
and
then,
they
try
to
sneak
it
all
into
the
arbitration
clause.
but
that
is
--
that's
--
the
kind
of
evidence
that
i'm
saying
ought
to
be
kept
out,
was
the
only
kind
of
evidence
in
the
warrior
&
gulf
case,
was
dealt
with
the
merits
of
the
dispute.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
arbitration
clause
didn't
mean
what
it
said
it
meant.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
and
i
confess
i
pushed
hard.
the
people
who
would
say
arbitrability
is
--
the
arbitrators
would
say,
"that
is
out."
the
court
can't
even
answer
that.
but,
i
would
have
to
concede
that
if
the
court
has
an
--
a
promise
to
enforce
and
has
to
find
out
what
the
promise
is,
it
has
to
hear
evidence
as
to
the
nature
of
the
promise
to
arbitrate.
i
don't
see
how
it
can
avoid
that
question.
but,
that's
--
that's
as
far
as
it
can
go.
and
--
and
i
think
this
court
--
i
hope
this
court
will
be
quite
exquisite
in
--
in
not
allowing
district
courts
because
district
courts
who
have
a
grievance
in
front
of
them
that
they
don't
like
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
know
you're
not
talking
about
cutler-hammer,
your
honors,
and
--
and
i
assume
--
i
assume
you're
not.
but,
in
the
most
recent
cases,
the
second
--
seventh
circuit
on
contracting
out,
they
construed
the
--
here's
--
here's
the
typical
case
that
gives
me
a
problem.
it's
a
contracting
out
case.
the
arbitration
clause
at
any
question
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
argument,
or
any
matters
relating
to
conditions
of
employment,
or
conditions
of
work,
or
of
practices
relating
to
conditions
of
work
could
be
arbitrated.
claim
was
that
the
contracting
out
was
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
the
court
said
it
was
not
arbitrable
because
contracting
out
didn't
deal
with
conditions
of
work.
i
assume,
as
your
honors
will
get
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
case,
and
i
don't
want
to
argue
it
now.
but,
this
is
the
reason
i
think
you
have
to
constrict
the
--
the
role
of
the
courts
to
a
narrow
role
but
a
genuine
role
in
looking
at
the
promise
to
arbitrate
not
to
--
and
say
don't
look
at
the
merits
of
the
grievance,
is
it
a
claim?
not
is
--
it's
in
fact
within
or
without
this.
but
do
you
claim
under
this
agreement?
if
you
do,
then
the
merits
of
your
claim
are
for
the
arbitrator
even
as
expressed
clause
or
an
implied
clause.
what
is
the
nature
of
the
claim?
i
don't
mean
the
grievance
because
the
grievance
is
often
very
good.
the
claim
made
in
court
as
to
what
you
want
the
arbitrator
to
hear
and
if
what
you
want
him
to
hear
is
a
claim
that
they
violated
the
grievance,
then
it's
covered.
that's
not
the
court's
business.
