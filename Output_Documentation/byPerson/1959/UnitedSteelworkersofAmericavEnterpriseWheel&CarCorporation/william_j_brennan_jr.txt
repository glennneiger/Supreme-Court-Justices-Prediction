on
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.

well
i
--
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wonder
--
i
wonder
if
we're
not
making
this
over
--
overly
difficult.
these
arbitration
clauses
ordinarily
say,
"grievances
as
to
interpretation
or
application
shall
be
arbitrated."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
understood,
mr.
feller
to
say
this,
yesterday.
that
if
a
grievance
is,
that
has
a
matter
of
interpretation
or
application
of
the
agreement.
the
employee
is
agreed
that
this
--
if
the
employer
refuses
to
voluntarily
to
go
to
arbitration,
is
all
he
need
to
show
a
district
judge,
namely,
one,
there
isn't
agreement
providing
for
submission
to
arbitration
of
grievances
over
the
interpretation
or
application
in
the
agreement.
two,
that
he
has
submitted
a
grievance
allegedly
claiming
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
agreement
as
properly
interpreted
in
the
plot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
if
there's
to
be
any
parole
evidence
at
all,
heard
by
the
district
judge,
that
is
only
to
the
evidence
going
directly
to
the
party's
negotiations
of
the
arbitration
provision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
beyond
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
if
the
reason
with
any
evidence
to
be
offered
as
to
the
parties
meaning
of
the
arbitration
provision
itself,
that
then
almost
automatically
an
order
for
arbitration
will
go.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
what
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
broad
and
which
is
plainer.
i
don't
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
mean
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
not
mean
this?
they
sat
down
and
they
were
bargaining
out
a
--
an
arbitrability
clause.
if
in
the
negotiations
over
the
form
of
that
clause,
there
had
been
any
discussion
whether
or
not
contracting
out
would
be
included
within
strictly
management
functions.
and
the
agreement
reached
between
the
parties
in
connection
with
the
negotiation
of
the
arbitrability
clause,
that
contracting
out
would
be
strictly
a
management
function.
then,
that
evidence
would
be
admissible
to
determine
the
question
whether
contracting
out
was
arbitrable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
contracting
out
was
the
subject
of
independent
negotiations
not
related
to
the
arbitrability
clause
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
it's
--
to
the
merits
and
goes
to
the
arbitrators.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
correct
that
the
district
court
action
do
compel
arbitration
was
brought
after
the
expiration
date
of
that
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
--
that
you
would
defend
against
the
action
to
compel
arbitration
on
the
ground
that
the
contract
had
been
expired
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
noticed
in
paragraph
nine
of
the
company's
answer,
at
page
10
of
the
second,
is
it,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
--
this
apparently
contends
for
mootness
on
the
ground
that
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
would
be
binding
only
during
the
life
of
the
contract
which
expired
at
midnight,
april
4.
therefore,
the
question
has
now
become
moot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
second,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
then,
may
i
ask
mr.
beatty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
basis
apart
which
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
there
could
be
no
back
pay
after
the
expiration
date
of
the
contract
or
any
reinstatement
after
that
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
was
the
--
what
--
where
in
the
arbitration
provision
itself
or
what
in
the
arbitration
provision
itself
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
as
indicating
a
limited
scope
for
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
there
isn't
anything,
is
there,
in
the
arbitration
provision
itself
which
indicates
that
the
parties
agreed
upon
such
a
limitation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
as
justice
harlan
is
suggesting.
the
real
question
is
whether
he
may
determine
that
over
the
court
has
to
determine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
does
not
say
the
argument
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
wouldn't
that
same
argument
mean
that
after
the
expiration
date,
it
could
not
have
been
the
appointment
of
an
arbitrator
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what's
exactly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
contract
authority
after
its
expiration
date
for
the
appointment
of
an
arbitrator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
didn't
say
anything
about
the
pointing
an
arbitrator,
an
arbitrator
acting
after
the
expiration
date
of
the
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
being
so.
in
other
words,
the
grievance
arose
in
the
--
during
the
period
of
the
contract.
why
should
the
expiration
date
have
any
bearing
upon
the
appropriate
remedy
within
a
contract
to
be
resolved?
