there's
no
dispute
here,
i
take
it,
if
there
was
an
arbitrable
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
not
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
terms
of
the
new
contract
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
didn't
understand
mr.
feller
to
say
yesterday,
that
if
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause,
that
parallel
evidence
in
the
proper
case
would
not
be
admissible
to
--
and
illuminate
the
meaning
of
the
arbitration
clause
anymore
than
it
--
it
would
be
admissible
in
any
other
kind
of
the
contract
clause.
that
--
that
his
point
was
that
the
evidence
that
was
sought
to
be
relied
on
here
as
limiting
the
arbitration
clause
if
properly
read
did
not
go
to
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause
but
went
to
the
merits
of
the
dispute
which
was
admissible
under
the
arbitration
clause
itself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
depends
on
how
you
read
the
record
as
to
whether
this
parole
evidence
in
the
warrior
case
bears
upon
arbitrability
as
his
opponent
said
or
whether
it
bears
only
upon
the
merits
of
the
underlying
issue,
as
mr.
feller
claimed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
have
to
read
the
record
and
decide
that
for
yourself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
think
there's
any
confusions
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
--
why
isn't
that
that
clause
that
gives
that
arbitrator
the
right
to
decide
whether
the
agreement
does
authorize
a
award
of
this
kind
even
though
the
agreement
has
expired?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
very
issue,
isn't
it?
that
--
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that's
the
whole
issue
in
this
--
this
problem
we're
talking
about.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
haven't
got
this
situation.
you
haven't
got
an
arbitrator
in
the
face
of
an
expressed
provision
in
the
agreement
saying
that
he
could
not
make
an
award
except
up
to
the
date,
up
to
the
time
that
the
agreement
expired.
and
then,
the
arbitrator
goes
ahead
and
not
withstanding
that
and
says,
"well,
i'm
going
to
make
the
award
anyway."
that's
--
that's
--
there,
you'll
have
a
situation
where
he
was
acting
outside
his
power,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
the
agreement
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
agreement
silent
here,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
could
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
arbitrator
has
had
a
sentence
in
his
opinion
saying
that,
"from
my
experience,
in
these
cases
over
the
last
20
years,
i
take
--
notice
myself
that
these
agreements
throughout
the
industry
do
cover
awards
after
the
expiration
date
of
the
agreement
and
that
in
the
absence
of
an
expressed
provision
to
the
contrary,
i'm
the
one
who
interpret
this
agreement
in
accordance
to
that
general
practice."
was
that
have
been
reviewable
by
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
he
was
not
blind
in
what
he
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
not
a
--
well,
that
brings
you
right
back
to
the
central
issue
as
to
what
the
contract
means
and
that's
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
contract
doesn't
mean
that.
there
is
no
answer
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
the
contract
does
mean
it.
the
court
of
appeals
is
off
based,
isn't
that
it?
