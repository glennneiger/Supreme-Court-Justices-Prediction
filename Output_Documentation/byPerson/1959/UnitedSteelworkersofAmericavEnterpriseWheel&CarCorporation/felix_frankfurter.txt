justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
hope
i'm
mentioning
some,
we
don't
need
to
exclude
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
he
said
that,
while
it
wasn't
written
into
the
contract,
there
was
a
firm
oral
understanding
that
certain
categories
of
employees
will
get
$3.50.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
reopen
the
warrior
case.
but
suppose
the
company
there
said
there
was
a
firm
understanding
which
was
not
written
out,
that
contracting
out
of
his
--
is
within
the
prerogative
of
the
employer,
suppose
that
issue
was
tended
in
those
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
could
have
dealt
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
do
you
say
that
isn't
warrior.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
do
you
say
that
that
isn't
precisely
what
was
the
contention
of
the
company
in
warrior?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
were
sustained
by
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
those
terms
that
the
claim
was
that
it
was
sought
to
put
such
a
restriction
into
the
contract.
and
that
restriction
was
not
put
into
the
contract
and
that
meant
or
is
allowed
be
found
to
me
that
it
was
the
full
facts
of
purposes
written
into
the
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
if
you
said
that
--
that
extrinsic
evidence
is
admissible
in
order
to
add
to
or
subtract,
and
make
3
equals
$3.50.
just
what
are
the
criteria
by
which
extrinsic
evidence
to
infuse
an
element
not
in
the
contract
in
terms
maybe
admitted
and
what
must
be
excluded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
you
said
here,
that
--
that
the
$3,
a
provision
that
the
rate
shall
be
$3
an
hour
maybe
supplemented
or
extended
by
what
justice
stewart
called
common
law
understanding
or
an
explicit
understanding
between
the
parties
deal
or
with
written
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
--
why
is
$3,
they
made
--
may
be
made
to
mean
$3.50
by
extrinsic
oral
testimony.
if
i
may
not,
strictly
within
--
strictly
managerial
functions,
it
made
to
mean
the
right
to
--
to
--
they're
not
the
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
we've
just
agreed
that
if
--
if
that
--
that
--
it
maybe
made
an
arbitral
issue,
although
on
the
face
of
the
contract,
it
is
excluded
from
being
a
arbitral
issue.
namely,
if
three
--
if
the
contract
is
read,
three
--
three
equals
three.
and
you
say,
you
may
introduce
evidence
to
prove
it's
an
arbitral
issue
and
must
be
allowed
to
go
to
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
must
have
enlightened
the
court
that
that's
what
it
means
in
order
to
allow
that
issue
to
go
to
the
--
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
mean
he
says,
"3
equals
$3.50"
that's
an
end
of
the
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
whenever
i
hear
that,
i
always
think
that
i
must
have
some
guide
to
understand
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
the
factual
situation
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
facts
don't
established
criteria.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
too
sure
if
i
understand
that.
if
the
contract
says
$3
and
the
grievance
is,
that
he
has
$5,
but
was
denied.
and
i
think,
i'm
under
the
contract
entitled,
although
it
doesn't
say
so,
to
$5.
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
the
court
must
let
$5
rather
that
$3,
that
is
if
you
go
to
the
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then,
if
your
complaint
helps
me
much,
because
there
must
be
some
connection
between
the
allegation
and
--
and
the
remedies
sought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
you're
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
i
can
--
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
order
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
and
then
that
--
and
answer
both
questions.
i
understand
you
to
say,
that
if
a
grievance
claims
is
claimed
to
arise
under
the
contract,
no
matter
what
the
contract
in
terms
says,
that
must
automatically
be
sent
to
arbitrator.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
see
if
i
can
put
that
in
plain
english.
[laughter]
in
plainer
english
--
plainer
english.
there's
an
arbitration
clause
requiring
arbitration
of
grievances
arising
out
of
interpretation
or
application
of
the
contract.
the
union
invokes
that
clause
by
saying,
"we
claim
--
our
grievance
is
that
we
--
we
made
a
claim
which
was
rejected
and
apparently
on
the
face
of
the
contract
was
properly
ejected
because
it
flies
in
the
face
of
a
specific
provision
of
the
contract.
but,
we
claim
that
a
true
construction
through
interpretation
of
the
contract
says
three
equals
five
and
whether
that
is
so
or
not,
we
want
to
go
to
arbitration."
and
you,
in
your
case
are
claiming
that
if
in
fact
the
arbitrator
finds
that
three
equals
five,
that's
final
and
not
subject
to
court
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
drawing
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
there's
a
--
there's
a
--
an
emphasis
of
what
justice
harlan
just
said.
if
you
will
add
that
if
you
claim,
not
that
it's
an
extension
or
an
addition
to
or
a
modification
of
the
arbitration
clause
but
comes
within
it.
that
is
not
subject
to
court
scrutiny.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
claim
--
if
you
claim
that
your
claim
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
under
substantive
merits
comes
within
the
scope
of
interpretation
of
a
contract,
that
is
not
subject
to
court
scrutiny.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
they
find
that
on
parole
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
--
now,
you
bring
me
where
you
brought
the
chief
justice's
confusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
that
by
--
by
appropriately
phrasing
by
careful
phrasing
which
doesn't
require
a
great
ingenuity,
you
could
prevent
any
--
any
review
by
the
court
as
to
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
my
worry.
that's
--
that
was
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
particular
worry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that's
a
supplemental
--
a
supplemental
or
annex
to
the
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
that's
--
that's
the
better
difference.
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
doesn't
raise
the
difficulties
of
--
of
parole
evidence
talked
across
the
tables,
offers
and
rejections
and
--
and
qualifications.
that's
a
very
different
story.
you
got
it
--
it
--
then
it
followed
the
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
i
follow
mr.
feller's
argument,
it
was,
that
if
the
claim
is
made
that
the
--
that
the
merit
of
the
issue
that
the
substantive
grievance
is
within
the
terms
of
the
arbitration
clause,
that
claim
is
made.
the
court
must
take
it
without
more
ado.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody
agrees
--
everybody
agrees
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody
agrees
to
that
because
the
question
then
is,
what
is
within
the
scope
of
his
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
difference
between
what
you
call
a
clear
cut
and
a
non-clear
cut
situation
maybe
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
the
power
to
determine
what
an
ambiguous
situation
means
and
the
exercise
of
a
right
to
go
outside
of
a
concededly
limited
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
i
meant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
examples
that
were
given,
if
the
arbitrator
says,
"this
agreement
is
way
below
the
prevailing
rate
of
wages
in
that
district
or
in
that
state
or
in
that
industry
and
i
think
it's
an
exploitation
of
labor
not
to
give
them
plus
x."
contract
says
to
be
sure,
so
many
dollars.
it's
an
exploitation
of
labor
not
to
give
x
plus
y.
there,
you
would
concededly
say,
he
is
actually
being
a
benevolent
--
he's
santa
clause
and
not
construing
the
terms
of
the
contract.
but
if
the
term
relate
--
if
the
language
used
plus
whatever
relevant
material
maybe
introduced
from
without
permits
a
construction
which,
if
it
had
been
spelled
out,
would
have
been
spelled
out
that
way.
then
he
can
--
then
he
isn't
doing
what
he
pleases.
he
is
exercising
the
kind
of
--
he
is
doing
what
this
court
does
and
every
court
does
when
they
have
a
statute
before
it
and
says,
"yes,
these
seem
to
be
plain
words
but
there's
a
lot
of
light
when
he
get
to
congressional
records
and
congressional
committee
reports
and
it
means
just
the
opposite."
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
we
all
know
that
--
that
there's
a
--
if
the
contracts
run
beyond
the
expired
term
just
as
a
man
who
is
appointed
for
five
years,
they
said
for
a
six
years
at
the
presence
of
an
appointed
successor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
maybe
an
understanding
which
was
alive
during
the
year
that
it
should
continue
after
the
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
the
merits
of
it.
you're
not
deciding
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
these
has
to
be
worked
out
by
implication
when
you
use
practical.
all
these
has
to
be
worked
out
by
exegesis
that
the
--
although
the
contract
is
at
an
end,
it
continues
to
have
vitality
because
something
took
place
for
which
you
want
to
make
--
which
you
want
to
make
good.
now,
what
intellectual
difficulties
or
logic
of
difficulty,
the
practical
difficulties
of
them
saying,
"there
maybe
some
other
implications
that
lay
people
like
us,
don't
understand
what
the
arbitrator
mean."
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
law
takes
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
law

as
the

just
as
the

had
a

the
case,

became
the

was

justice

did
they
bargain
for
to
be
bargained,
to

determined
by
the
arbitrator.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
that
they
--
justice

can
bargain
for
which
differentiates
this
from
my
point
of
view
rightly
from
ordinary
arbitral
provisions
in
so
called
commercial
contracts
or
(inaudible)
contracts
or
any
other
contracts,
where
that's
just
a

adjusting
in

justice

i
didn't
mean
it
to
be.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
vital
factor
of
it
(voice

--
justice

that
differentiates
it
from
commercial
and
(inaudible)
arbitral
provisions.
justice
felix

where
is
article
iv?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
as
--
put
as
unusual
cases,
you've
dealt
with
it
a
while
ago.
supposing
your
automobile
case,
the
company
is
prepared
to
show
that
as
a
bargaining
table,
that
was
put
in,
that
was
put
in
for
--
in
order
to
have
an
agreement
and
not
have
a
strike.
but
it
was
explicitly
understood
and
they're
prepared
to
back
it
up
to
the
hilt
with
testimony
of
the
persons
of
the
automobile
workers,
but
the
parole
evidence
will
decide
that.
it
was
put
in
in
order
because
the
leadership
thought
that
that
would
satisfy
the
men
or
they
didn't
want
to
offend
their
feeling
against
him.
but
it
was
agreed
that
it
would
never
be
invoked
by
the
--
and
that
they
are
prepared
to
put
in
a
parole
evidence
that
that
was
just
binding
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
