mr.
elliot
bredhoff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
similar
to
the
two
cases
that
were
heard
yesterday,
the
american
manufacturing
company
case
and
the
warrior
&
gulf
case.
in
that,
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
the
effect
of
that
section
has
on
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
provisions
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
difference
in
this
case
from
the
others
is
that
those
involved
questions
of
enforcing
arbitrability
under
a
contract,
under
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
the
contract
whereas
this
case
involves
the
enforcement
of
an
award
already
rendered
by
an
arbitrator
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
the
real
question,
i
suppose,
boils
down
to,
should
the
courts
review
de
novo
an
arbitrator's
award
which
interprets
and
applies
the
provisions
of
a
contract?
the
facts
or
i
believe
in
large
part
undisputed,
the
contract
in
this
case
was
between
the
steel
workers
union
and
the
enterprise
company
at
huntington,
west
virginia
which
ran
for
a
period
of
one
year
from
april
5th,
1956
to
april
5th,
1957.
the
critical
contract
clauses
that
are
involved
here
are
article
iv
-
suspension
and
discharge,
which
may
be
found
on
--
in
the
record,
the
first
part
of
the
record.
the
record
is
in
two
parts
in
terms
of
pagination.
in
--
in
the
first
part,
pages
17
and
18
contained
the
provisions
of
article
iv
dealing
with
suspension
and
discharge.
and
it
is
a
typical
type
of
suspension
and
discharge
provision
found
in
collective
bargaining
agreements.
it
provides
in
summary
and
for
no
peremptory
discharges.
if
an
employer
wishes
to
discharge
or
discipline
an
employee,
he
must
first
invoke
a
suspension
for
no
more
than
five
days.
he
must
afford
the
employee
a
hearing.
he
must
present
the
employee
with
the
statement
of
the
offense
and
he
must
make
the
facts
available
surrounding
the
offense
at
the
hearing,
which
he
must
afford
the
employee.
after
that
hearing,
the
employer
is
required
to
make
a
determination
as
to
wether
to
extend
or
suspend
--
sustain
the
discharge
--
the
--
the
suspension
or
to
convert
the
suspension
into
a
discharge.
if
the
suspension
is
converted
into
a
discharge,
then
the
employee
has
the
right
to
avail
himself
of
the
grievance
provisions
of
the
contract
which
are
in
article
iii,
were
in
article
iii
of
the
particular
contract
before
us.
the
provisions
i've
just
summarized
are
the
rough
equivalent
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
the
procedural
due
process
which
we
know
at
law.
it's
the
--
the
rough
equivalent
in
the
industrial
government
of
a
--
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
the
due
process
that
is
to
be
accorded
an
employee
when
he's
--
when
he
is
to
be
suspended
or
discharged
by
an
employer.
now,
under
the
suspension
and
discharge
provision,
before
we
look
at
the
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery,
there
is
a
important
provision
which
states,
and
this
is
on
page
18
of
the
record,
the
first
part
of
the
record,
"should
it
be
determined
by
the
company
or
by
an
arbitrator
in
accordance
with
the
grievance
procedure
that
the
employee
has
been
suspended
unjustly
or
discharged
in
violation
of
the
provisions
of
this
agreement,
the
company
shall
reinstate
the
employee
and
pay
full
compensation
at
the
employee's
regular
rate
of
pay
for
the
time
lost."
that
is
a
provision
specifying
the
remedy
whenever
there
is
a
determination
that
an
employee
has
been
improperly
disciplined
or
discharged
by
an
employer.
it
is
in
a
sense
unlike
most
of
the
other
provisions
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
where
there
are
no
specific
remedies
stated
in
the
contract,
but
there
are
remedies
provided
through
the
law
of
arbitration
and
through
practices
and
understandings
of
the
parties.
now,
under
article
iii
of
that
contract
which
appears
on
page
16
of
the
record,
there
is
a
provision
that
any
differences
which
might
arise
between
the
company
and
the
union
or
its
members
employed
by
the
company
as
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
provisions
of
this
agreement
require
that
an
earnest
effort
shall
be
made
to
settle
such
differences
immediately.
and
then,
there
are
steps
set
forth
as
to
how
those
differences
are
to
be
resolved,
the
traditional
type
of
steps
at
ascending
levels
of
authority
between
the
union
and
the
company.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
there
was
at
first,
justice
harlan,
and
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
and
i'll
advert
to
that.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
at
the
present
time,
that's
correct.
now,
in
step
four
of
this
particular
clause
of
provision,
it
is
provided
that
in
the
event
the
dispute
shall
not
have
been
satisfactorily
settled
in
accordance
with
the
above,
it
shall
be
submitted
at
the
request
of
either
party
to
a
panel
of
three
members
including
an
impartial
member.
and
the
final
phraseology
in
that
article,
the
decision
of
the
umpire
shall
be
final
and
binding
on
the
parties.
now,
there
is
also
in
this
contract
and
this
appears
on
the
second
part
of
the
record,
the
pagination
on
page
7
of
the
second
part
of
the
paginated
record.
this
is
section
6
of
the
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery."
it
is
understood
and
agreed
that
neither
party
will
institute
civil
suits
or
illegal
proceedings
against
the
other
for
alleged
violation
of
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
labor
contract.
instead,
all
disputes
will
be
settled
in
the
manner
outlined
in
this
article
iii
-
adjustment
of
grievances."
this
is
an
unusual
clause
and
a
contract,
although
it
is
implicit
in
most
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
you
settle
your
disputes
under
the
machinery
provided
in
the
contract
and
not
take
your
disputes
into
the
courts
or
other
legal
machineries.
there
was,
we
believe
a
no-strike
clause,
although
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
however,
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
the
fact
that
a
no-strike
clause
existed
under
this
contract
because
the
grievance
who
are
involved
in
this
proceeding
were
actually
disciplined
for
violation
or
for
alleged
violation
of
what
must
has
been
a
no-strike
prohibition.
now,
the
particular
facts
that
led
to
the
discharges
in
this
case
are
summarized
succinctly
by
the
arbitrator
at
pages
19
through
21
of
the
second
part
of
the
record.
there
--
this
--
this
company
in
19
--
late
1956
and
early
1957
while
the
contract
wasn't
forced,
had
some
52
to
53
employees.
on
january
17th,
1957,
some
three
months
before
the
contract
was
to
expire
--
four
months.
the
--
a
group
of
employees,
a
committee
went
into
the
presidents'
office
to
protest
a
contemplated
discharge
of
an
employee
named
medley.
the
employees
felt
that
medley
should
not
be
disciplined
and
they
consulted
the
president
of
the
company
about
that.
the
president
stated
that
he
would
not
change
his
decision
but
he
told
them
that
they
could
resort
to
the
grievance
machinery
if
they
disagreed
with
his
determination.
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
office
and
the
employees
returned
to
the
plan.
at
about
1
p.m.,
the
employees
were
congregated
in
the
washroom
and
the
president
of
the
company
saw
them
there,
and
told
them
that
they
would
either
have
to
go
back
to
work
for
ring
out
and
go
outside
and
figure
it
out.
ring
out
of
the
plant
that
is
and
figure
out
what
they
were
going
to
do.
the
employees
then
punched
out
their
timecards
and
walked
outside.
the
president
stated
that
at
that
time,
he
had
made
no
decision
to
terminate
the
employment
of
these
men.
upon
leaving
the
plant,
the
grievance
consulted
the
staff
representative
of
the
union
who
advised
them
to
return
to
work,
to
file
a
grievance
with
respect
to
medley,
the
employee
whose
suspension
they
were
protesting
and
to
follow
the
contract
procedures.
they
went
back
to
the
plant
some
30
to
35
minutes
after
they
had
initially
walked
out.
they
asked
the
president
of
the
company
whether
they
--
whether
they
would
be
able
to
come
back
to
work
and
the
president
said
that
they
could
not
come
back
with
medley.
they
then
asked,
"how
about
if
we
keep
medley
out,
can
the
rest
of
us
come
back
in
the
morning?"
and
the
president
said
yes,
they
could.
they
could
come
back
the
following
morning.
however,
five
minutes
later,
the
president
calls
his
attorney.
the
president
of
the
company
called
his
attorney
and
the
attorney
advised
him
that
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
take
these
employees
back.
the
--
the
attorney
told
them
that
they
had
quit
their
employment
and
they
need
not
--
and
that
the
company
need
not
restore
them
to
employment
despite
what
the
president
had
told
them
just
five
minutes
previously.
the
following
day,
the
employees
did
report
for
work.
however,
they're
timecards
were
out
of
the
rack
and
they
were
told
that
they
did
not
have
employment
anymore
with
that
company.
the
employees
then
filed
a
grievance
on
january
23rd,
some
five
days
after
they
were
refused
reemployment
and
they
protested
their
discharge,
which
they
alleged
was
without
good
cause
and
they
also
alleged
that
it
was
defective
procedurally,
meaning,
that
the
suspension
and
discharge
procedures
specified
in
the
agreement
had
not
been
complied
with
because
they
were
not
handed
a
five-day
suspension.
they
were
not
given
a
hearing.
they
were
not
given
a
statement
of
the
offense
and
all
the
facts
surrounding
the
offense.
they
requested
reinstatement
and
all
lost
pay.
the
specific
remedy
provided
in
the
contrary.
they
did
not
request
damages
in
the
sense
that
damages
are
known
under
commercial
contracts
for
breaches
of
contract.
the
company
refused
to
process
the
grievance
in
the
manner
specified
in
article
iii
of
the
contract.
they
did
hold
some
discussions
after
a
period
of
some
weeks
outside
the
grievance
machinery
with
some
of
the
union
representatives
and
eventually,
it
was
agreed
that
the
first
three
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure
had
been
complied
with,
either
waived
or
actually
fulfilled.
the
union
--
then
on
february
17th,
some
one
month
after
the
discharge,
requested
that
the
matter
be
submitted
to
arbitration
in
accordance
with
step
four.
the
company
refused
to
arbitrate.
the
company
took
the
position
still
that
the
employees
had
quit,
they
were
not
re-employable
and
there
was
no
arbitrable
grievance.
however,
after
a
considerable
period
of
further
discussions
between
the
union
and
the
company
officials,
the
company
did
agree
to
submit
this
matter
to
arbitration
before
arbitrator
milton
schmidt.
still
later
however,
after
having
agreed
to
submit
the
matter
to
arbitration,
the
company
reneged
on
that
agreement
and
they
refused
to
submit
the
matter
to
arbitration.
now,
in
the
meantime,
the
contract
was
coming
to
a
conclusion.
the
april
4th
or
april
5th
date
1957
was
approaching
and
negotiations
were
taking
place
for
a
new
contract.
the
record
discloses
that
the
terms
of
a
new
contract
were
actually
agreed
upon.
some
wage
increases
were
to
be
provided
for
under
a
new
two-year
contract.
the
only
thing
that
prevented
the
execution
of
a
new
contract
was
the
company's
insistence
that
the
union
withdraw
the
grievance
regarding
the
11
employees
who
had
been
discharged
from
the
arbitration
process.
the
company
said
they
would
sign
a
contract
so
long
as
the
union
insisted
on
processing
the
--
the
grievance
through
the
arbitration
process
under
the
expired
contrary.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
--
i'm
going
to
come
to
that,
your
honor.
the
--
there
was
no
new
contract
actually
entered
into
in
written
form
because
of
the
company's
insistence
on
this
condition,
the
--
the
union
advised
the
company
that
it
could
not
possibly
waive
the
rights
of
the
11
employees
involved,
that
was
20%
of
the
workforce
and
they
instead
went
on
strike.
after
some
time,
the
employees
became
hard
pressed.
they
consulted
their
union
representative
and
indicated
they
would
like
to
go
back
to
work
if
they
could
arrange
to
go
back
to
work
under
the
old
--
under
the
--
the
terms
that
had
been
tentatively
agreed
upon.
the
employees
were
advised
by
the
union
representative
that
they
could
consult
with
the
president
of
the
company,
which
they
did,
and
they
made
arrangements
to
go
back
to
work.
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
precisely
what
those
arrangements
were.
the
employees
and
the
union
contend
that
they
went
back
to
work
under
the
terms
that
had
been
previously
agreed
upon
and
without
any
waiver
of
the
--
the
grievance
they've
submitted
to
arbitration.
the
company
claims
that
it
made
no
deal
with
the
union.
however,
the
company
president
did
say
we
never
a
--
this
is
on
page
36
of
the
second
portion
of
the
record."we
never
agreed
on
what
was
in
the
negotiations.
the
agreement
was
made
with
the
men.
they
were
outside
the
fence.
we
made
the
agreement
between
them
without
the
union
being
there.
so
it
appears
that
there
was
an
agreement
by
which
the
employees
returned
to
work.
it
was
never
reduced
to
writing
and
it
--
it
seems
that
there
was
at
least
a
de
facto
arrangement
governing
their
relationship
after
they
returned
to
work.
now,
after
the
union
found
that
it
could
not
submit
the
matter
to
arbitration
because
of
the
company's
refusal,
the
union
instituted
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
under
section
301,
requesting
specific
performance
of
article
iii
of
the
agreement,
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
of
the
agreement.
the
company
answered
and
the
union
moved
for
summary
judgement.
the
matter
was
heard
on
the
pleadings
and
affidavits.
the
court
granted
the
union's
motion
for
summary
judgement
and
in
an
oral
opinion,
the
court
indicated
that
the
union
was
not
seeking
damages.
the
union
was
simply
seeking
enforcement
of
the
provision
of
the
agreement
which
required
that
all
differences
as
to
interpretation
and
application
of
the
contract
be
resolved
in
the
final
stage
by
arbitration
and
by
final
and
binding
arbitration.
the
court
rejected
a
company
argument
that
the
matter
had
become
moot
because
of
the
intervening
expiration
of
the
contract.
the
court
said
that
relying
on
lincoln
mills
in
large
part
that
these
were
rights
that
accrued
under
an
old
contract,
rights
that
vested
under
an
old
contract
and
they
must
continue
to
be
processed
under
the
machinery
provided
for
under
that
old
contract.
the
district
court
issued
an
order
compelling
submission
to
arbitration.
now,
the
arbitration
took
place,
there
was
no
appeal
incidentally
by
the
company.
the
arbitration
took
place
before
arbitrator
milton
schmidt.
and
if
i,
maybe
permitted
and
decide
about
mr.
schmidt,
there
were
several
names
of
waiting
arbitrators
mentioned
here
yesterday
and
i
would
like
to
add
mr.
schmidt's
name
to
that
list.
he
is
a
distinguished
arbitrator
in
cincinnati.
he
is
the
arbitrator,
the
permanent
arbitrator
under
one
of
our
largest
contracts
between
the
steelworkers
union
and
the
continental
can
company.
he
has
been
an
arbitrator
for
perhaps
15
to
20
years
under
other
steel
and
other
industry
contracts
and
has
a
very
fine
reputation
in
the
arbitration
fraternities.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
--
i
certainly
hope
not,
justice
frankfurter.
the
arbitration
hearing
place
on
january
3rd,
1958
and
before
the
arbitrator,
the
company
contended
that
the
employees
had
quit
there
jobs,
that
the
discharges
in
any
event,
if
it
were
to
be
a
discharge
were
justified
by
the
employee's
participation
in
the
em
--
unlawful
strike
and
that
the
case
was
moot
because
the
contract
had
expired.
the
arbitrator,
arbitrator
schmidt,
issued
his
award
on
april
10th,
1958.
he
held
that
the
employees
had
not

plant.
that
type
of

did
not

a

of

he
held

he
also
excluded
from

any

that
the
employees
may
have
had
at
--
in
other
employments
during
the
period
they
were
not
working
for
the
company.
after
the
award
was
issued
by
arbitrator
schmidt,
the
company
refused
to
comply
with
the
award.
they
did
offer
back
pay
up
to
the
end
of
the
contract,
less
the
deductions
specified
by
arbitrator
schmidt,
but
they
refused
reinstatement
and
they
refused
any
back
pay
for
the
period
running
from
april
5th,
1957
up
until
the
arbitrators
award
or
thereafter,
up
until
they
were
to
offer
reinstatement.
so
what
we
really
have
here
was
an
employer
improperly
discharging
employees
on
--
from
--
from
their
employment.
the
employees
attempting
to
enforce
their
rights
under
the
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery,
the
employer
refusing
to
accept
the
grievance
in
the
first
instance,
finally,
after
agreeing
to
arbitration,
reneging
on
his
agreement
to
arbitrate,
then
being
forced
by
the
court,
the
federal
district
court
to
finally
arbitrate
and
after
finally
arbitrating
--
refusing
to
abide
by
the
arbitration
award.
also,
the
employer
attempted
to
get
the
union
to
waive
the
rights
of
the
employees
as
the
condition
for
a
new
contract.
the
union
was
then
forced
to
go
into
the
federal
district
court
to
obtain
a
show
cause
order
as
to
why
the
employer
should
not
abide
by
the
arbitrator's
award.
this
was
done
on
november
25th,
1958.
the
company
answered,
the
court
issued
a
show
cause
order.
and
on
december
16th,
1958,
the
district
court
issued
an
order
and
the
written
opinion
in
which
he
ordered
the
company
to
comply
with
all
the
provisions
of
the
arbitration
award.
the
judges'
opinion
appears
on
the
first
part
of
the
record
at
pages
3
through
14.
the
judge
pointed
out
that
the
case
is
being
prosecuted
by
the
union
primarily
to
obtain
reinstatement
of
the
workers
with
the
monetary
award,
a
secondary
consideration
to
the
company
argument
that
the
arbitrator
had
exceeded
his
authority
by
ordering
reinstatement
and
back
pay
for
a
period
beyond
the
contract
expiration
date.
the
court
said
this,
"an
investigation
of
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
company
that
is
to
reveal
that
in
each
of
them,
the
discharged
employees
accepted
the
termination
of
their
employment
and
suit
for
damages
for
the
wrongful
discharge
without
seeking
reinstatement."
he
noted
that
the
men
involved
were
elderly
men
and
that
reinstatement
was
far
more
critical
to
them
than
any
back
pay
or
any
monetary
damages
that
might
be
due
them.
and
the
added
at
pages
10
and
11
of
the
record,
the
first
part
of
the
record,
the
following.
to
allow
the
defendant
to
only
reimburse
the
employees
up
until
april
4th,
1957
would
be
to
allow
the
defendant
to
profit
unfairly
from
its
own
wrongdoing.
if
the
man
had
not
been
unjustly
discharged,
it
must
be
assumed
that
their
employment
would
have
been
continued
today.
until
reinstated,
these
employees
continue
to
suffer
loss
of
wages
by
virtue
of
the
defendant's
improper
action,
irrespective
of
any
expiration
of
the
contract.
the
company
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
at
--
on
the
particular
issue
involved
here
whether
the
award
may
include
reinstatement
and
back
pay
for
the
period
after
the
contract
had
expired.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
award
of
back
pay
for
the
period
subsequent
to
april
4,
1957
could
not
be
enforced.
the
court
reasoned
that
the
cause
collective
bargaining
agreements
do
not
create
a
permanent
status
or
condition,
or
given
indefinite
tenure
or
extend
rights
created
and
arising
under
the
contract
beyond
its
terms,
it
falls
that
the
employees
who
were
discharged
unlawfully
could
not
enforce
an
award
for
back
pay.
the
court
modified
the
judgement
so
as
to
limit
the
recovery
of
wages
just
to
the
period
of
the
contract
expiration.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
the
district
judge
directly
reinstatement,
your
honor.
he
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
no,
it
was
not
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
and
this
appears
from
our
petition
on
rehearing.
in
their
first
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
deal
with
reinstatement.
they
merely
limited
the
back
pay
to
the
contract
expiration
date.
however,
in
our
petition
for
rehearing,
we
asked
the
court
to
clarify
that
and
the
court
did
clarify
that
by
striking
out
from
the
arbitrator's
award
the
requirement
that
the
company
reinstate
the
employees.
the
only
question
left
then
and
the
only
question
that
the
company
has
taken
up
here
that
has
contested
here
is,
it
relates
to
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
the
district
court's
order
with
respect
to
reinstatement
and
back
pay
subsequent
to
the
termination
of
the
agreement.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well,
and
that's
the
company
that
the
--
that's
the
question
that
the
company
has
addressed
itself
to,
justice
whittaker.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
now,
perhaps
we
can
refine
that
issue
a
bit.
the
company
contention
is
that
the
arbitrator
lacked
jurisdiction
--
lack
jurisdiction
to
award
any
relief
running
beyond
the
contract
expiration
date
either
reinstatement
or
money
damage
--
or
--
or
an
award
of
back
pay
beyond
that
time.
but,
when
the
company
contends
that,
it
is
the
same
as
saying
that
the
matter
of
reinstatement
and
back
pay
after
the
contract
date
was
not
arbitrable
to
begin
with.
and
in
that
sense,
it
is
similar
to
the
issues
that
we
had
here
yesterday.
if
the
arbitrator
did
--
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
make
that
kind
of
an
award,
well,
that
issue
was
not
arbitrable
in
the
first
instance.
and
in
--
in
the
cases
yesterday,
we
urged.
my
brother
feller
urged
that
the
court
in
deciding
arbitrability
should
look
to
see
whether
there
was
a
claim
alleged
under
the
contract.
when
the
issue
was
posed
in
terms
of
enforcing
an
award,
we
believe
the
court
should
look
only
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
arbitrator
interpreted
or
applied
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
it
is
sort
of
the
other
side
of
the
coin
or
the
tail
end
of
the
same
type
of
inquiry
in
question
which
is
presented
when
an
arbitrability
issue
is
before
the
court.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
should
look
into
whether
the
arbitrator's
interpretation
or
application
was
correct
under
the
contract.
and
that
is
backed
up
by
perhaps
a
hundred
years
or
more
of
common
law
doctrine.
we
only
believe
that
the
court
should
determine
whether
he
decided
initially
under
the
contract.
and
we
may
illustrate
that
by
an
example.
my
brother
feller
talked
yesterday
about
an
end
of
the
contract
providing
$3
per
hour
for
a
job
plus
12
jobs
let
us
say.
and
the
employee
demands
$3.50.
well,
if
the
employee
had
claimed
the
$3.50
because
he
said
that
he
was
just
being
underpaid
and
it
was
unfair,
we
conceded
yesterday
that
would
not
have
been
arbitrable.
but
suppose
he
actually
he
claimed
he
was
entitled
to
the
$3
--
$3.50
under
the
contract
and
the
issue
did
go
to
arbitration.
and
the
arbitrator
finally
decided,
"well,
the
contract
didn't
give
him
that
right
but
he
thinks
other
companies
are
paying
$3.50.
the
company
ought
to
pay
this
employee
$3.50.
that
would
be
beyond
his
jurisdiction
because
he
was
not
interpreting
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
but
that
issue
was
not
arbitrable
in
the
first
instance
anyway
and
not
properly
arbitrable
because
it
was
--
it
was
an
improper
claim
to
begin
with
that
it's
true
it
did
go
to
arbitration,
but
if
the
claim
had
been
a
proper
claim,
it
--
it
really
was
not
in
the
arbitration
category.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
if
--
if
he
alleged
the
claim
under
the
contract.
we
--
we
indicated
yesterday
that
we
thought
he
was
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
on
that,
just
i
suppose
as
any
type
of
suit
in
the
federal
and
in
the
courts
must
be
processed
no
--
no
matter
how
poorly
or
--
or
insubstantial
the
suit
might
be.
but,
if
he
simply
came
in
and
said,
"it's
unfair"
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
want
a
raise.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that
would
not
be
a
contract
dispute
as
to
the
interpretation
or
application.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
--
i
believe
that
he
says
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
--
the
contract
really
meant
$3.50.
it
was
a
mistake
or
something
like
that.
then,
i
think
you
would
have
an
--
an
arbitrable
issue.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
but
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes,
your
honor.
as
--
and
that
is
the
next
example
that
i
wanted
to
address
myself
to.
we
cannot
limit
the
arbitration
or
--
for
the
contract
strictly
to
the
--
the
terms
of
the
booklet
that
we
handed
up
to
you
yesterday.
now,
we
don't
know
--
we
don't
have
to
get
in
here
to
the
precise
question
of
proof,
but
there
are
practices.
there
are
written
understandings
which
supplement
the
contract.
there
are
supplemental
seniority
arrangements.
there
are
supplemental
understandings
as
to
work
under
hazardous
conditions.
there
are
all
types
of
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that's
right.
this
is
under
industrial
common
law
which
arbitrators
are
experienced
with
and
know
how
to
apply.
and
there
are
instance
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
u.s.
steel
contract,
there
is
a
provision
which
expressly
protects
all
benefits
and
practices
and
local
agreements
which
provide
benefits
and
excessive,
what
is
in
the
contract.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
--
well,
i
--
i
think
we
conceded
yesterday
that
--
that
would
be
evidence
that
could
be
submitted
to
the
--
to
the
court
in
determining
whether
there
was
an
arbitrable
issue.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
it
would
go
really
to
the
competency
of
--
of
the
evidence
and
whether
proposals
should
be
brought
into
--
into
a
discussion.
once
you
had
a
written
intent
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
pardon?
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
because
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
because
in
--
in
warrior,
the
--
there
was
no
discussion
in
the
negotiations
about
modifying
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
a
contract.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes.
but
that
--
that
issue
really
goes
to
the
merits
of
what
the
parties
agreed
upon
in
terms
of
management
strike
to
contract
out.
and
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes.
justice
frankfurter,
the
extrinsic
evidence,
mind
you,
would
be
submitted
to
the
arbitrator.
and
that
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well,
it
--
here
again,
we
--
we
believe
that's
the
sort
of
issue
that
--
that
must
be
presented
to
the
arbitrator.
if
the
company
came
into
the
district
court
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
no.
we
--
we
said
that
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
we
said
that
when
the
employee
makes
a
claim
under
the
contract,
that
the
contract
really
means
we're
entitled
to
$3.50.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well,
no.
i
don't
believe
--
we
--
we
went
that
far
in
our
--
in
our
position
yesterday.
i
think,
we
indicated
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well,
that
and
i
suppose
we
have
--
we
--
we
have
to
take
each
factual
situation
as
--
as
it
arises,
but
the
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
--
the
fact
that
he
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes.
i
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
but
justice
frankfurter,
as
--
as
we
talked
yesterday.
a
grievance
is
written
by
ordinance.
and
he
does
not
with
any
definity
specify
the
contract
provisions
that
he
might
come
under.
he
may
know
that
he
has
a
local
understanding
with
his
foreman.
it
may
even
be
in
writing
that
he's
supposed
to
get
$3.50,
when
he
works
on
a
particularly
hazardous
job
even
though
his
normal
rate
is
$3.
and
if
you
look
at
decent
jobs
less
--
or
ultimately
look
to
the
contract,
it
says
$3.
but
he
has
alleged
a
claim
under
the
contract
and
he
doesn't
spell
it
out
in
the
grievance
and
we
believe
that
that
issue
should
be
submitted
to
an
arbitrator
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
believe
so.
just
like
any
complaint
which
might
allege
something
it's
as
nonsensical
as
that.
at
least
that
is
processed
until
there
is
a
determination
made
in
the
courts
that
he
did
--
he
wasn't
entitled
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
--
by
those
under
commercial
contracts.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes,
but
that
is
not
determined
until
there
is
a
hearing
on
that.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes.
i
believe
we
are
justice
warren
because
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well,
let
me
go
--
sorry.
i
believe
--
i
believe
we
are
on
--
on
all
force.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that
--
it
--
it
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
--
that
does
not
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
confusion
may
have
arisen
when
i
referred
to
a
complaint
being
filed
in
a
court,
chief
justice
warren.
a
complaint
under
a
commercial
contract
say,
where
--
wherein
the
plaintiff
claims
$5
where
the
contract
seems
to
say
he
is
entitled
to
$3
or
$5000,
let
us
say,
instead
of
$3000.
it
maybe
a
completely
insubstantial
claim
and
it
has
nothing
to
back
it
up,
but
that
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
will
not
be
disposed
of
until
--
until
the
--
there
has
been
some
evidence
taken
and
found
to
be
not
meritorious.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
on
--
on
the
other
two
cases.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes,
well
--
i
think
justice
frankfurter
has
stated
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
--
has
stated
it
--
has
stated
it
correctly,
that
when
--
when
the
employee
alleges
in
the
grievance
machinery,
that
he
has
a
claim
under
the
contract.
a
claim
of
violation
by
the
employer,
a
difference
as
to
the
application
or
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
a
contract,
then
he
is
entitled
to
have
that
issue
submitted
to
an
arbitrator.
and
the
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well,
that
is
correct.
he
has
to
show
that
there
is
an
arbitration
clause
which
provides
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
and
what
with
--
and
in
the
typical
clause,
any
difference
between
the
parties
maybe
arbitrated.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that's
correct.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that
is
correct,
justice
brennan.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
--
that's
correct.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that
is
correct,
justice
brennan.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that
is
correct.
if
he
finds
it
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
--
under
the
contract
the
three
equals
five,
that's
correct.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
don't
think
there's
any
inconsistency
between
justice
brennan
[laughs]
and
justice
frankfurter
saying
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
[laughs]
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
perhaps
we'll
let
the
person
determine
which
is
the
plainer
one.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
justice
warren,
i
--
i
believe
the
--
the
statements
are
consistent
with
what
i
was
trying
to
say
and
if
there's
any
confusion,
i'd
be
happy
to
try
to
clarify
our
position.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes,
and
justice
harlan
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
--
i
believe
so,
justice
harlan
--
mr.
feller
was
--
was
talking
about
parole
evidence
when
he
was
referring
to
efforts
by
company
venue
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that's
right.
and
--
and
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that
is
correct.
but
it
isn't
legitimate
inquiry
to
determine
whether
the
parties
actually
meant
to
modify
the
arbitration
provisions
of
the
agreement
as
distinguished
from
the
substantive
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
--
provisions
on
the
merit.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
now
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
comes
within
the
arbitration
clause?
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
oh,
yes.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
unless
--
unless
the
court
finds
that
the
parties
specifically
intended
that
that
type
of
dispute
should
not
be
subject
to
the
arbitrations
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
we
--
we
think
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
do
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
--
i
believe,
mr.
feller
said
that
the
--
the
court
could
inquire
as
to
whether
there
were
--
was
any
--
anything
that
could
be
relied
on,
any
competent
proof
that
the
parties
intended
to
modify.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
the
agreement
in
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes.
let's
make
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
but
on
the
merits.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
let's
--
instead
of
worrying
about
parole
evidence
that
they
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
now,
let
--
let
us
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
let
us
simplify
it
a
bit.
let
us
say
that
there
was
a
supplemental
understanding
reduced
to
writing,
a
letter
understanding
that
the
--
the
parties
understand
that
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
shall
not
be
deemed
to
encompass
arbitrability
of
contracting
out
issues.
now,
that
is
not
on
the
face
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
it's
is
a
letter
i
suppose,
which
the
company
would
be
entitled
to
produce
in
the
district
court.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
well
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
yes.
well,
that
--
that
gets
into
the
question
of,
i
--
i
believe
the
--
the
competency
and
--
and
the
type
of
proof
that
you're
looking
for,
but
it
--
i
don't
believe
that
it
varies
--
the
--
the
theory
on
which
--
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
--
were
--
were
decided
--
which
were
decided.
mr.
elliot
bredhoff
i
--
i
believe
as
i
--
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
