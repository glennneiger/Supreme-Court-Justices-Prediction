justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
the
question
you've
been
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
let
me
if
i
understand
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
have
the
right
to
discharge
them
immediately,
except
for
union
activity
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wait
a
minute,
provided
the
contract
has
expired,
is
that
what
you
mean
to
say?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right,
now
you're
talking
about
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
aren't
you?
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals,
they
take
the
view
that
in
the
absence
of
the
contract,
there
is
no
right
to
perpetual
employment.
this
is
a
right
in
--
that
in
here
is
in
the
contract
and
that
when
the
contract
ended,
there
was
nothing
to
which
the
employee
was
to
be
reinstated,
but
if
he'd
been
deprived
of
rights
during
the
period
of
the
contract,
ge
was
entitled
to
have
an
award
for
those
rights.
now,
isn't
that
what
they
said?
yes,
sir.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
that
your
--
still
your
view?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
vested
rights
acquired
under
the
contract
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
have
to
be
awarded.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
and
--
but,
to
order
reinstatement
after
the
contract
has
ended,
would
be
to
order
them
reinstated
to
a
job
that
may
not
then
exist
for
the
contract
has
ended,
is
that
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
could
order
them
reinstated,
couldn't
you?
to
the
status
of
the
employees
during
the
period
of
the
contract,
but
you
effectively
do
that
plan.
you'll
give
them
every
benefit
that
they
could
have
from
that
service
under
the
contract
which
has
now
expired.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
under
the
view
of
court
of
appeals.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
--
what
i
am
saying
--
i'm
asking
you
this,
is
it
true
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
when
the
court
of
appeals
requires
that
these
men
be
paid
for
the
time
intervening
to
the
end
of
the
contract
though
not
worked
that
this
was
in
effect
a
practical
reinstatement
of
them
to
the
end
of
the
contract?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
just
for
my
own
clarification.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
it
have
added
anything
to
the
rights
acquired
by
these
employees
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
said,
"reinstatement
shall
--
is
ordered
as
well
as
back
pay
to
the
termination
of
the
contract,
period."
would
have
anything
more
then,
than
it
have
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
another
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes
you
do.
