justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
sole
point,
as
you
see
it,
that
has
to
be
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
ordinance
attempted
to
bar
the
distribution
of
the
handbill
(inaudible)
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
entirely
on
the
fact
if
we
have
--
rather
presented
and
as
you
see
it,
the
question
of
whether
the
right
to
distribute
anonymously,
he
has
the
right
protected
by
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
without
getting
into
to
the
fact,
i
was
trying
to
find
out
if
that
is
really
what
we
have
to
concern,
will
the
constitution
protects
anonymity
in
writing?
is
there
anything
in
it
--
any
other
purpose
such
that,
as
you
see
it
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
--
is
your
argument
is
based
on
anything
whatever
except
the
anonymity
of
the
--
of
the
handbill?
is
there
any
other
vice
in
it
that
says
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
you're
concern,
if
it
was
signed
in
view
of
the
opinion
that
the
ordinance
was
delayed,
it's
up
for
them
to
decide.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
violate
the
ordinance,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
--
are
you
basing
your
argument
on
the
fact
that
if
the
ordinance
did
not
require
his
name,
suppose
he
just
bars
on
the
entirety?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
in
hope
with
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
it
does
affect,
doesn't
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
affect
it
whether
--
whether
a
man
can
be
required
to
put
his
name
on
such
an
article
if
he
wants
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
is
that,
if
he
had
named
that,
so
that
it
can
be
traced.
it's
in
line,
isn't
it,
with
the
general
statutes
throughout
the
country
that
in
election,
certain
distribution
of
literature
or
what
the
name
--
the
name
of
the
person
who
is
responsible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
your
other
argument.
i
--
i
do
not
say
it's
irrelevant
to
this.
i
do
not
understand
how
you
see
it.
it
does
not
restrict
or
regulate
freedom
of
speech,
whatever.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
certainly
would
have
made
the
unions
criminal,
wouldn't
it,
or
the
letters
of
unions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
were
distributed
on
the
street.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
that
--
i'm
not
saying
a
quick
way
our
constitution
goes
on.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
your
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
would.
you'd
had
to
admit,
i
would
think,
that
you
face
it
squarely,
that
it
does
can
to
restrict
in
some
answers
with
the
expression
of
views
on
public
questions
or
questions
they
wouldn't
discuss
and
it
does
tend
to
restrict.
your
problem
is
does
the
constitution
forbid
the
passage
of
such
a
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
is
the
real
--
i
don't
--
maybe
there
is
another
one
but
i
don't
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
he
is
not
protected
from
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
inserting
anonymous
view.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
that's
probably
raised
and
other
statutes
decided
this
