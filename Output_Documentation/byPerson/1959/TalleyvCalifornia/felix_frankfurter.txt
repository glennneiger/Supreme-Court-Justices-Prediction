you're
very
broad
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
go
too
far.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
ordinance
analog
with
another
city?
justice
felix
frankfurter
exactly.
they
are
related
to
great
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
ordinance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
ordinance
is
not
restricted
to
a
specific
flyer
that
is
in
the
record.
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
would
apply,
would
it
not,
to
an
anonymous
businessman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sending
out
flyers
where
they
should
be
with
him
rather
than
with
a
bigger
concern
or
a
smaller
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
enveloping
this
discussion
into
racial
consideration,
it
seems
to
me,
i
think
foremost,
inadmissible
atmospheric
introductions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
face
of
the
statute,
you're
not
saying
that
you
--
you
apply
--
you
--
you're
not
objecting
to
the
application
of
this
ordinance
to
this
particular
leaflet
or
what
it
implies
or
its
racial
concern,
are
you?
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
any
showing
that's
restricted
to
racial
belief
kind
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
are
you
saying,
you
must
carve
out
to
the
statute
which
cannot
be
attacked,
according
to
your
last
statement
or
should
not
be
because
of
its
--
or
its
vagueness
or
its
scope
but
it
should
be
carve
out
that
it
can't
be
applied
anything
you
turn
to
races?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
understand
that
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
not
saying
that,
and
i
don't
understand
why
the
offense
is
still
on
racial
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
case
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
they
try
to
lag
in
racial
possibility
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
though
we
haven't
got
enough
trouble
with
that
without
being
lagged
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
understand
that
argument,
it
means
that
this
court
may
decide
that
whatever
may
be
the
validity
of
this
statute
in
other
situation,
it
can't
be
constitutionally
applied
in
this
case
because
the
leaflet
pertains
to
racial
matter,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
the
further
--
then
--
then
you
have
to
argue
the
further
question
whether
a
statute
otherwise
constitutional
is
applied
to
the
generality
of
the
situations
must
fall
if,
within
the
generality
of
situations,
the
incident
of
its
effect
in
a
particular
case
is
a
racial
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
arguing
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
popped
out,
out
of
a
statute
which
presumptively
or
assumably
because,
i
think,
when
you
have
a
city
ordinance,
you've
got
an
act
of
the
state
because
the
city
is
authorized
to
pass
laws
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
state
therefore,
for
practical
purposes,
the
state
is
here
and
not
merely
a
city
or
a
council
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
is
state
power
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
you're
arguing
that
a
statute
which
in
its
generality
may
be
valid
and
may
not
be
applied
to
anything
pertaining
for
racial
consideration,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
merely.
but
if
you
say
this
particular
thing
falls
because
the
flyer
does
relate
to
racial
matters,
then
you
must
argue
that
it's
--
that
--
that
has
to
be
carved
out,
whatever
maybe
the
faith
of
the
rest
of
the
ordinance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask,
as
the
matter
of
fact,
whether
you're
suggesting
or
just
allowable
to
draw
the
inference
from
the
record
that
this
ordinance
is
applied
only
to
situations
like
this,
like
the
(inaudible)
case,
is
this
the
(inaudible)
problem
also?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
considered
the
(inaudible)
the
other
way
around
in
which
this
court
sustained
the
statute
requiring
disclosure
by
newspapers
of
the
owners
and
the
shareholders?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
we
think
--
you
don't
think
that
qualifies
this
absolute
statement
of
yours
about
the
right
to
anonymity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
tom
paine
had
published
his
common
sense
as
a
periodic
and
sought
to
send
it
through
the
mail,
he
would
under
the
lewis
case,
as
i
understand
it,
have
to
disclose
who
own
his
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
owns
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

and
whoever
stockholders
--
and
whoever
stockholders,
well,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
the
writer
is
a
stockholder
and
the
owner,
then
he
would
have
to
disclose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
got
to
disclose
more
under
the
statute
than
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

stockholders,
the
officers
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
people
who
really
run
the
show
and
own
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
if
there
were
recitals
setting
forth
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
as
the
city
of
--
where
is
this?
los
angeles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
view
of
the
fact
that
the
city
of
los
angeles
during
the
last
10
years
or
five
years
has
had
experience
with
the
abusive
exercise
of
--
of
anonymous
flyers
in
the
sense
that
--
that
libelous
doctrine
has
been
circulated
for
questionably
libelous
stuff
or
other
--
in
otherwise
offensive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
deem
it
in
the
balance
of
considerations
desirable
that
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
you
think
that
would
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
said
that
the
city
should
say
--
they
should've
said
so
if
that
was
its
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can
contribute
to
that.
for
the
first
time,
we
must
--
was
distributed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
absence
of
it
--
the
absence
of
it
cannot
illegalize
it
when
presence
worth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says
impliedly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
impliedly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all,
even
city
council
or
whatever
they
call
it
in
los
angeles,
pass
ordinances
for
some
purpose
and
not
nearly
out
of
whim
at
least,
we
must
make
such
attribution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
a
statute
or
an
ordinance,
the
legal
enactment
may
cover
things
which
it
may
cover,
it
may
in
order
--
in
the
interest
of
enforcements
sweep
in
--
sweep
within
itself
things
that
are
innocent.
justice

(voice

--
justice

no
matter

no
matter
how
small
or
no
matter
how
grave
the
abuse
with
which
it
is
dealt
--
justice

because
of
the
difficulties
of
proving.
justice

i'm

i'm
not
talking
about
convenience,
i'm
talking
about
balancing
considerations
justifying
an
ordinance

in
a
particular
case,
may
not
cover
the
abuse
which
justify
an
ordinance.
justice

frankfurter
(voice

of
valid
statute
that
is
constitutional
as
an
encroachment
on

i
don't
think
in
those
terms,
if
it's
valid
it
is
an
encroachment.
justice

(voice

the

of
course,
if
it's
not
valid,
it
can't
be

absolutely.
justice

lot
of
things
that
inhibit

wish

justice

so
that
is
--
so
that's,
the
real
question,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
justification
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
real
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
commercial
and
--
the
original
ordinance?
was
commercial
(inaudible)
justice

it
was
drafted
in
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
necessarily
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
means
that
if
any
--
any
trial,
any
leaflet
is
libelous,
then
you
must
disclose
the
name.
i
think
that
would
be
a
ridiculous
ordinance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say
your
generality
done
is
too
specific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
statute
says
or
--
or
a
legal
enactment
says,
“our
experience
is
that
libelous
leaflets
often
circulated
by
people
whose
responsibility
cannot
be
traced
because
the
use
of
fictitious
name,
therefore,
we
enact
the
following
and
the
present
statute.”
would
that
be
narrow
or
broad
in
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
--
don't
talk
generally.
just
answer
my
question
whether
the
recital
said
we
have
had
experience
with
the
inability
to
strive
for
responsibility
to
the
--
to
the
distributors
of
libelous
leaflets,
therefore,
we
enact
the
following
to
which
this
specific
ordinance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
specific
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
it
be
more
narrowly
drafted
than
to
say
in
order
to
bring
to
book,
people
who
scatter
like
those
leaflets,
the
responsibility
for
the
scattering
should
be
disclosed,
how
it
could
be
more
narrow
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
--
i
come
back
then,
but
don't
you
think
that
it
would
be
ridiculously
to
pass
an
ordinance
saying,
“all
persons
who
scatter
libelous
leaflets
should
disclose
their
responsibility.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
a
mockery
of
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
libels
aren't
restricted
to
commercial
organization
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

probably
not
of
it
by
commercial
organization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
behind
your
--
behind
your
last
statement
of
the
implication
for
which
you
have
warrant
what
i
regard
as
an
unsustainable
proposition
of
this
court
namely
that
commercial
utterances
have
less
freedom
of
less
protection
by
freedom
of
speech,
the
noncommercial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
think
that
that
proposition
can
withstand
criticism.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
commercial
utterance
in
tag
of
your
less
protections
for
utterance
are
noncommercial.
justice

(voice

to
be
a
greater
champion
of
free
speech
than
that.
