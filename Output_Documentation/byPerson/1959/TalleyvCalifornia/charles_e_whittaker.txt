i
ask
you,

do
you
think

whittaker
would
you
think
that
in
a
case
where
some
one
man,
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
one
man
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
started
the
handbill
campaign
against
you
or
one
of
your
clients
in
which
he
spoke
falsely
and
viciously
argued
and
yet
being

you
know
means
to
know
he
was
so
that
you
might
enjoin
or
stop
that
conduct
which
you
say
then
the
same
as
you
say

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
relevance
is
that
--
in
fact
that
those
who
(inaudible)
in
this
proposition
are
still
anonymously
or
as
i
understand
this
argument,
it
simply
requires
that
one
who
is
circulating
a
handbill
in
which
he
may
say
anything
he
likes,
he
should
be
in
anyplace
he
wants,
must
say
(inaudible)
and
second,
caused
it
to
be
distributed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
isn't
that
what
it
does?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
want

say
that
the

purify

that
the

(inaudible)
to
evaluate
the

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
from
this

you'd
be
handled,
you
may
say
anything
you
like,
whatever
you
like,
whenever
you
like
so
long
as

how
the
