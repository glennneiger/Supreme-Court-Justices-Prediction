mr.
hugh
r.
manes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
it's
conceded
by
the
city
that
the
distribution
of
noncommercial
handbills
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
this
is
so,
it
is
our
contention
that
anonymity
is
also
entitled
to
constitutional
protection
since
anonymity
may
be
necessary
for
the
circulation
of
speech
and
ideas
and
hence
to
the
exercise
of
a
first
amendment
right.
now,
historically,
there
are
practical
and
historic
uses
of
anonymity.
it
has
always
been
or
frequently
has
been
invoked
to
protect
the
speaker
and
the
author
from
reprisal
during
the
struggle
for
religious
liberty.
anonymity
was
vital
to
the
expression
of
ideas
if
only
to
gain
entrance
to
the
forum
of
opinion
and
if
only
to
be
heard.
now,
very
frequently,
the
churches
of
those
days
attempted
to
expose
heretics
by
requiring
that
the
names
be
put
to
what
they
right
and
much
the
same
fashion
as
this
ordinance
has
drawn
here.
even
today,
the
non-conformant
--
non-conformant
as
the
heretic
has
frequently
found
it
necessary
to
foster
his
ideas
anonymously
in
order
that
he
may
be
heard
and
indeed
in
order
that
he
may
earn
a
livelihood.
i
have
reference
to
the
fact
that
we
find
it
a
common
practice
for
blacklisted
writers
in
the
entertainment
industry
to
--
to
write
anonymously
or
under
a
fictitious
name
in
order
to
earn
a
livelihood.
so,
here
are
some
practical
consequences
of
the
use
of
anonymity.
but
in
any
event,
we
contend,
that
it
remains
for
the
author
and
for
the
speaker
to
set
the
conditions
under
which
he
will
speak
or
express
his
ideas
that
if
he
is
going
to
--
go
into
the
market
place
of
ideas
to
--
to
buy
for
the
contention
for
--
for
public
acceptance
of
his
idea,
it
must
be
left
to
him
to
--
to
decide
whether
he
will
incur
the
risk
of
facing
a
hostile
community,
that
community
hostile
to
his
ideas
anonymously
or
by
identifying
himself.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
considered
that.
and
we
think
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
say,
your
honor,
that
we
do
not
contend
that
the
right
to
anonymity
is
an
unlimited
right
by
any
means.
we
say
that
there
are
kinds
and
circumstances
when
anonymity
--
when
the
state
has
a
right
to
limit
anonymity.
we
say
only
that
it
cannot
be
an
unlimited
right
to
suppress
anonymity
or
the
right
to
anonymity
so
completely
and
so
broadly
as
is
done
here.
now,
in
the
lewis
case,
the
lewis
case,
the
congress
had
determined
under
the
exercise
of
its
postal
powers,
expressed
authority,
that
there
was
a
particular
evil
involved
and
that
--
that
evil
attempted
to
meet
by
imposing
a
condition
on
the
exercise
of
the
second
class
mailing
privilege.
it
was
imposing
that
condition
on
a
commercial
profit
making
venture
which
is
very
much
unlike
our
particular
leaflet
here.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
who
owns
his
paper
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
--
but
not
necessarily
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes.
but
not
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
but
he
--
but
he
--
excuse
me,
your
honor,
but
he
discloses
the
publisher
--
as
a
publisher
the
right
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
but
the
writer
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes,
sir.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
writers
of
the
articles
within
the
newspaper
are
not
compelled
to
be
disclosed.
there
is
no
requirement
that
they
be
disclosed.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
that's
--
that's
what
it
does.
but
its
impact,
it
has
a
farther
reach,
your
honor,
because
what
we
are
trying
to
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
there
are
times
and
circumstances
when
speech
can
only
be
freely
uttered
anonymously
or
if
--
if
the
author
or
the
speaker
remains
anonymous,
so
that
he
does
not
leave
a
trail
to
the
door
for
those
who
are
hostile
to
his
ideas,
we
are
suggesting
furthermore,
your
honor,
that
as
the
matter
of
--
of
freedom,
he
retains
the
right
to
determine
under
what
circumstances
he
will
utter
speech,
unless
that
there
is
a
prevailing
or
a
paramount
--
a
countervailing
societal
interest
involved.
and
we
are
suggesting
that
the
only
countervailing
interest
which
the
city
is
claiming
here
is
simply
to
purify
speech.
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
cannot
be
a
--
a
valid
justification
for
requiring
everybody
under
all
circumstances
at
all
places
to
disclose
their
identity
when
they
have
something
to
say.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
don't
say
that
--
i
don't
say
that
that
is
the
sole
purpose.
they
relate
--
they
advert
to
the
objectives
of
this
ordinance
as
being
limited
to
fraud,
being
limited
obscenity
or
pornography,
being
limited
to
libel
and
--
and
the
like.
but
the
ordinance
says
nothing
of
this
kind.
it
is
broader
and
so
in
order
to
justify
the
lawful
--
the
coverage
of
lawful
speech,
the
--
the
city
comes
back
and
says
as
to
lawful
speech,
it's
better
that
it'd
be
--
that
it'd
be
labeled
like
peas
and
garments.
so
that,
we
may
evaluate
the
--
the
idea
by
knowing
who
said
it.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
--
this
kind
of
a
doctrine
has
a
lot
of
danger.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes,
sir.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
remains
that
on
page
16
and
17
of
the
city's
brief,
they
make
the
contention
that
it
is
to
the
further
purpose
or
the
further
objective
that
might
justify
this
ordinance
is
to
purify
speech,
and
i
quote
from
the
brief,
that
it
--
the
one
sentence
from
the
brief,
the
middle
of
page
16,
“by
identifying
the
person
interested
in
distributing
a
pamphlet,
the
tenure
of
the
comments
take
on
new
meaning.”
for
example,
a
leaflet
circulated
by
--
is
(inaudible)
would
have
a
decidedly
different
import
than
the
same
remarks
decimated
by
robert
hutchins
or
cardinal
newman
or
(inaudible)
now,
i
simply
suggest
an
answer
to
that
contention,
your
honor,
that
this
is
not
the
kind
societal
interest
which
may
justify
this
ordinance
because
if
you're
going
to
clear
up
the
market
place
of
ideas
with
names
vying
for
contention
instead
of
ideas,
then
people
will
begin
to
look
to
who
said
what
rather
than
to
what
they
themselves
should
be
believing
and
listening
to.
now,
it's
our
contention
further,
your
honor,
that
in
connection
with
some
of
these
other
areas
where
the
city,
where
the
states,
where
the
congress
has
in
certain
--
certain
circumstances
required
disclosure.
as
for
example,
in
the
harriss
case
which
this
court
recently
had
before
it
involving
the
--
the
involving
the
question
of
requiring
a
lobbyist
to
disclose
his
--
his
affiliations
with
the
organization
that
he
was
representing.
there
again,
we're
dealing
with
a
--
an
individual
who
is
paid
to
influence
legislation
and
who
is
influencing
legislation
directly
with
the
--
with
the
legislator
involved.
and
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
instance,
not
only
was
congress
limiting
itself
to
a
specific
evil
but
indeed,
in
order
to
preserve
the
constitutionality
of
that
particular
statute,
this
court
found
it
necessary
to
further
limit
the
scope
of
that
particular
statute
so
as
not
to
impinge
upon
the
dissemination
of
ideas.
the
city
has
also
made
reference
to
another
area
where
disclosure
may
be
required
and
that
is
the
area
involving
corrupt
practices
whereby
states,
like,
incidentally,
california,
section
5005
of
the
education
--
of
the
elections
code
which
requires
that
the
--
which
requires
that
the
circulator
of
a
pamphlet
or
of
a
hand
bill
identify
himself
and
his
name
and
his
address,
where
his
bill
is
aimed
at
the
defeat
of
a
candidate.
here
again,
the
--
the
states
involved
are
aimed
at
preserving
other
fundamental
freedoms.
and
again,
is
limited
narrowly
to
a
particular
evil.
but
what
we
suggest
here
is
that
there
is
no
valid
basis
once
you
have
conceded
that,
as
in
this
particular
pamphlet,
that
advocacy
of
an
idea
is
lawful
that
that
particular
individual
who
disseminates
that
idea
should
have
the
right
to
determine
for
himself
the
conditions
under
which
he
will
advocate
that
particular
idea.
and
he
has
chosen
here
to
advocate
it
anonymously
perhaps,
because
of
the
reasons,
mr.
wirin's
suggests
or
perhaps,
for
his
own
--
for
other
reasons
which
--
which
he
may
have
determined,
which
i
don't
think
our
--
our
particular
important
as
long
as
he
has
not
expressed
an
idea
which
--
which
affronts
the
ordinance.
now
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
suppose
that
it
would
be
covered
by
the
ordinance,
your
honor.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
well,
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
according
to
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case,
there
has
not
been
that
much
of
the
abuse.
but
even
if
that
were
true,
what
we
are
contending,
your
honor,
is
that
if
this
is
the
kind
of
evil
at
which
the
city
is
interested
in
aiming
its
--
its
legislation,
it
should
say
so.
it
should
not
have
a
broad
ordinance
which
covers
--
which
goes
beyond
that
particular
objective.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
los
angeles.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
no.
mr.
hugh

manes
i
don't

mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
don't
think
that
mere
finding
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
no,
your
honor.
what
i
say
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
don't
think
that
findings
can
save
an
ordinance
by
themselves.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
what
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
not
necessary
but
the
fact
here
is
that
we
don't
have
an
ordinance
that
is
in
any
way
limited
to
the
objectives
which
the
city
is
claiming
for
it.
the
city
says
that
this
ordinance
is
aimed
at
libel,
it's
aimed
at
--
it
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
it's
a
--
it's
aimed
at
obscenity.
but
the
fact
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
that's
true.
but
the
police
officer
did
not
find
himself
limited
by
those
objectives
and
there
is
no
contention
here
either
by
the
city
nor
by
the
court
below
that
this
ordinance
said
anything
that
was
unlawful
in
california.
the
ideas
that
are
advocated
in
this
particular
pamphlet
were
lawfully
expressed
and
were
lawful
ideas
and
he
had
the
right
to
say
them,
anonymously
or
otherwise.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
not
where
a
speech
is
concern,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
--
that
an
ordinance
can
be
justified
--
can
be
justified
where
it
compasses
speech
unnecessarily,
unless
there
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
well,
as
this
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
well,
as
this
court
has
often
said,
you
honor,
mere
convenience
cannot
server
to
justify
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
--
the
unconstitutional
infringement
on
speech.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
can
only
say,
your
honor,
that
--
that
in
those
particular
circumstances,
if
you're
going
to
allow
the
city
to
make
small
encroachments
on
speech,
then
soon,
those
small
encroachments
will
be
brought
into
larger
ones.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
but
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
but
it
can't
be
valid
if
it
encompasses
lawful
speech
and
that
was
our
point,
your
honor.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
well,
if
it
--
yes,
if
it
inhibits
lawful
speech
of
(inaudible)
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
want
to
reserve
the
rest
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
oh,
there
are
certain
times.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
there
are
certain
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
there
are
certain
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
but
always
justified
by
the
circumstances
of
time
and
place.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes.
mr.
hugh

manes
that
is
the
issue,
your
honor.
