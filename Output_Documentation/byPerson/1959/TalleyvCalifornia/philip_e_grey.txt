mr.
philip
e.
grey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
it
has
been
stated
by
members
of
this
court
in
various
cases,
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
embraces
two
concepts,
first,
freedom
to
believe
and
second,
freedom
to
act.
the
first
is
absolute
but
in
the
nature
of
things,
the
second
cannot
be
conduct
remaining
subject
to
regulation
for
the
protection
of
the
society.
over
a
period
of
time
and
in
accordance
with
the
various
opinions
rendered
by
this
court,
and
other
appellate
courts,
the
city
of
los
angeles
has
attempted
to
regulate
the
exercise
of
that
right
in
connection
with
free
speech
and
press
in
order
to
protect
the
general
public
from
various
evils
which
have
from
time
to
time
become
apparent
to
the
members
of
the
city
council.
this
court
may
recall
in
1939,
in
schneider
versus
irvington,
a
california
--
a
los
--
a
los
angeles
city
ordinance
was
involved
in
the
kim
young
section
of
that
opinion.
thereafter,
that
ordinance
was
amended
to
comply
with
the
opinions
of
this
court.
the
original
ordinance
was
broad,
prohibiting
the
circulation
of
any
type
of
handbill
within
the
city
upon
public
streets
or
parks.
thereafter,
it
was
amended
to
only
cover
the
commercial
handbills.
in
other
series
of
ordinances
were
reexamined
that
had
been
on
the
books.
some
of
them
related
to
the
distribution
of
commercial
handbills
to
automobiles
getting
out
on
the
streets
and
interfering
with
traffic.
another
type
of
an
ordinance
dealt
with
going
onto
private
property
where
the
tenant
had
play
or
posted
signs
stating
that,
no
advertising.
in
accordance
with
the
various
opinions
rendered,
we
reenacted
all
our
ordinances.
in
order
to
answer
justice
--
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion,
the
legislative
history
and
municipalities
and
cities,
of
course,
is
very
lenient.
we
were
able
to
find
out
that
prior
to
1931,
an
effort
was
made
by
the
local
chamber
of
commerce,
urging
the
city
council
to
do
something
about
these
handbills
and
advertising
matters
which
were
false
and
misleading,
had
no
names
of
sponsors.
they
were
particularly
interested
in
the
fictitious
name.
they
said,
“who
are
these
people
that
are
distributing,
who
are
advertising,
doing
things
of
that
sort?”
the
legal
record
that
were
able
to
find
indicates
that
a
request
from
the
council
to
the
city
attorney
as
to
their
legal
opinion
on
this
subject.
the
city
attorney
wrote
back
and
formed
a
conclusion
that
distribution
of
handbills,
pamphlets
or
other
matters,
without
the
name
of
the
fictitious
firm
or
officers
would
be
legal.
thereafter,
in
the
early
part
of
1932,
an
ordinance
was
drafted,
submitted
to
the
city
council
and
approved
by
then
which
related
to
the
original
subject,
unlawful
for
any
person,
firm
or
association
to
distribute
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
the
advertisement
or
handbill
or
any
other
matter
which
does
not
have
the
names
of
the
sponsors
or
of
such
literature.
then
in
1936,
the
various
ordinances
were
reenacted
into
a
code.
at
that
time,
the
word
“commercial”
was
left
out
were
it
had
said
commercial
handbill
or
advertising,
so
that
the
ordinances
remained
on
the
books
since
originally
1932
to
1936.
then
i
might
say
that
this
is
--
the
talley
case
is
the
second
case
that
has
ever
come
before
any
of
the
courts
is
--
on
the
appellate
level.
the
first
case
being,
people
versus
arnold
which
is
referred
to
on
the
briefs
and
cited
as
127
cal.
app.
2d
at
page
484.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
we
do
not
so
contend.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
the
thought
that
we
--
the
only
reason
that
we
can
come
up
with
an
answer
or
reason
for
that
being
that
they
felt
that
all
handbills
should
have
this
protection
that
we
seek
to
give
to
the
general
public
who
is
responsible
for
disseminating
this
information,
whether
it'd
would
be
commercial
or
others.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
commercial
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
1936.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes
--
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
is
true
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
the
very
first
one,
exhibit
a,
defendant's
exhibit
a
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
defendant
exhibit
b
carries
with
it
the
name
of
the
printer.
the
court
will
notice
that.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it
has
the
name
of
the
person.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
it
has
one.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
these
handbills
were
offered
by
the
defendant
in
an
attempt
to
show
that
the
(inaudible)
theory
was
not
being
applied.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
we
have
no
proof
--
we
have
no
proof
that
these
were
actually
being
circulated
by
the
market.
we
did
have
some
testimony
offered
to
indicate
that
such
handbills
or
similar
handbills
had
been
seen
posted
in
the
market
itself.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i,
of
my
own
knowledge,
have
very
little
information
as
to
the
number
of
arrest
made
under
this
particular
ordinance.
and
as
i
have
started
to
say
that
to
my
knowledge,
this
is
the
second
time
that
this
--
this
ordinance
was
brought
before
the
appellate
department
or
--
that
i
know
of.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
that
is
generally
true
and
i
think
that
they
generally
have
the
name
of
the
printer
and
they
know
that
they
seem
to
be
indicating
that
they
are
distributed
by
this
company,
the
market
or
whoever
it
might
be
to
that
sense.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
don't
know
what
the
police
--
how
they
had
been
enforcing
it.
i
know
that
there
have
been
very
few
cases
on
this
particular
code
section.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
originally,
1931
and
then
codified
in
1936.
the
appellate
department
initially,
when
this
matter
came
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
they
took
all
the
old
ordinances.
they
were
numerous
and
put
them
into
a
code
whether
this
was
a
typographical
error
or
printers
error
and
leaving
a
word
out,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
at
this
time.
there
isn't
just
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
and
the
original
sections
are
continuations
of
the
original
ordinances.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
there's
always
a
savings
clause.
i
did
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
this
matter,
the
grounds
of
appeal
offered
to
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
are
found
on
page
26
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
and
they
are,
upon
which
the
defendant
of
the
appellant
here
are
relied,
first,
that
this
--
this
section
is
unconstitutional
in
that
said
code
section
of
bridges
of
defendant's
freedom
of
speech
and
thus
in
violation
of
california
state
law
and
of
the
united
states
federal
laws
with
regards
to
freedom
of
speech.
they
also
made
second
ground
that
there
is
unequal
enforcement
of
law
in
the
application
of
this
section
to
the
defendant
that
on
the
account
of
and
because
of
the
unequal
enforcement.
the
attempt
that's
--
to
which
i
just
eluded
was
made
in
the
trial
court
and
as
the
court
will
read
the
record
which
is
very
scanty.
in
fact,
the
entire
record
was
--
the
people's
case
was
stipulated
to
between
counsel
that
this
appellant
was
distributing
these
particular
handbills.
the
handbill
bears
on
its
face,
the
name
of
a
so-called
fictitious
firm,
organization
or
group,
the
national
consumers
mobilization.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
sir.
we
do
not
know.
there
was
no
evidence
presented
at
the
trial
court
level.
we
have
no
way
of
determining
that.
there
was
no
evidence
to
--
presented
to
tell
us
whether
mr.
talley
was
the
printer
of
this
article,
whether
he
is
the
national
consumers
mobilization,
whether
he
was
merely
the
distributor,
we
have
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
the
record
does
not
show.
he
was
charged
in
the
complaint
with
distributing
a
handbill
which
failed
to
have
these
various
things
on
them.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
we
think
that's
quite
important.
here
is
a
national
consumers
mobilization
of
this
list,
“is
not
the
public
entitled
to
know
of
whom
this
organization
is
composed?
is
it
one
man?
is
it
a
group
of
man?
are
they
prominent
citizens?
are
they
sincere
people?
are
they
competitors
of
this
particular
market
place?
who
are
they?”
that
is
all
we
seek
to
establish,
so
that,
originally,
the
only
argument
was
the
constitutionality.
statements
have
been
made
here
that
now,
they
--
they
are
urging
that
this
is
unconstitutionally
applied.
no
effort
was
made
in
the
trial
court
to
show
the
circumstances
under
which
mr.
talley
sought
to
distribute
these
handbills.
no
evidence
of
any
kind.
we
had
a
statute
and
as
indicated
by
the
appellate
court
in
the
--
their
opinion
in
talley.
they
make
reference.
appellant
concedes
that
the
decision
rendered
by
this
court
in
people
versus
arnold
disposes
of
his
connections
adversely
but
asks
reconsideration
and
reversal
of
--
of
the
view
there
taken
submitting
substantially
the
same
brief
that
was
submitted
to
that
court.
that
was
the
issue
before
the
court
and
the
court
had
rendered
its
opinion
in
people
versus
arnold
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
this
ordinance
saying
that
there
was
no
prior
restraint,
no
censorship
requirements,
a
person
still
has
the
right
to
freely
say,
speak,
write,
whatever
he
wants.
all
that
the
city
was
requiring
was
some
person
who
is
responsible,
who
is
the
person
that
is
exercising
this
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
so.
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance,
we
are
not
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
would
say
that
would
be
wrong.
i
think
that
if
we
--
we
don't
want
to
get
on
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
i've
--
now,
we're
saying
this
word
right
to
use
it
anonymously.
first,
we
have
to
assume
then,
that
mr.
talley
was
the
man
who
wrote
this,
that
he
does
not
want
to
put
his
name
on
it.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
the
only
question
that
we
--
that
this
court
has
called
upon
to
decide
is,
such
an
ordinance
is
this,
not
a
reasonable
ordinance,
which
regulates
the
manner
of
the
constitutional
right
of
freedom
of
speech
and
press.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
we
said
if
the
handbill
had
some
name
or
the
names
of
the
officers,
the
person
who
distributed.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
then
we
say
that
that
ordinance
was
unconstitutional.
if
the
ordinance
had
no
person
shall
distribute
any
handbill,
we
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
we
say
that
this
ordinance
does
not
do
that,
however.
we
have
said
this
ordinance
does
not
affect
the
right
to
exercise
your
right
of
freedom
of
speech
or
press.
all
we
say
is
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
the
--
the
ordinance
does
not
require
that
the
author
put
his
name
on.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
yes,
we
think
it's
in
line
on
all
of
those
cases.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
to
protect
the
general
public.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
to
identify
it
--
to
make
a
person
responsible.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
we
think
this
--
in
petitioner's
own
brief,
he
--
he
quotes
very,
very
pertinent
language
to
me.
he
said,
“it
is
certain
that
every
man
has
a
right
to
keep
his
own
sentiments
if
he
pleases.
he
has
certainly
a
right
to
judge
whether
he
will
make
them
public
or
commit
them
only
to
the
side
of
his
friends.”
that's
what
we
say
here.
if
a
man
wants
to
speak,
and
he
gets
it
before
an
ordinance,
he
is
known,
you
can
see
who
he
is.
if
he
wants
to
write,
he
is
free
to
write.
that
reminds
me
of
a
situation,
i
don't
know
whether
the
members
of
this
court
are
aware
of
what
happened.
several
months
ago,
in
the
city
of
san
francisco,
there
was
such
a
campaign
of
handbills
at
a
particular
time
as
strategic
points
in
the
various
part
of
the
city,
where
the
city
was
flooded
with
thousands
of
handbills
attacking
the
mayor
and
the
commissioner
unsigned
by
the
time
he
could
gather
these
handbills,
who
distributed
them,
who
caused
them
to
be
distributed
was
never
known.
now,
we
understand
that
there
is
a
reward
offered
leading
to
the
apprehension
of
the
persons
who
did
that.
must
the
law
resort
to
that
type
of
thin?
we
think
not.
we
think
our
ordinance
is
reasonable
under
this
requirement
that
it
does
not
curtail
freedom
of
speech
at
any
manner
and
that
anonymity
is
not
a
guarantee
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
of
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
may
i
say
this.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
we'll
--
reference
has
been
made
to
the
historical
items
of
anonymous
writings.
i
think,
(inaudible)
say
this,
“today,
we
have
a
constitutional
right
to
freedom
of
speech.
we
don't
have
to
write
secretly,
we
don't
have
to
be
ashamed
or
hide
or
whether
being
ashamed
of
what
you
write
is
something
else,
again,
that's
personal.
but
if
you
don't
want
to
express
your
views,
no
one
is
forcing
you
to
say
what
are
you
thinking,
tell
me
what
you're
thinking,
you
must
tell
me.”
mr.
philip
e.
grey
we'd
say
no.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
we
say
that
the
constitutional
right
is
to,
for
person
freely
to
do
it,
to
identify
himself,
to
be
responsible
for
what
he
says.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
anonymous
writings
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
is
what
--
mr.
philip
e.

i
think
that's
true.
i
have
no
--
