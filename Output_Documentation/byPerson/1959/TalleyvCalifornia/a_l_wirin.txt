mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
from
los
angeles
also
or
i
wouldn't
be
here,
entirely
different
case
than
the
former
one.
it
involves
an
ordinance
--
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
los
angeles,
the
text
of
which
appears
of
appendix
a
to
our
opening
brief,
our
white
brief
and
the
constitutionality
of
which
we
challenge
as
applied.
this
case
involving
the
first
amendment
as
absorbed
by
the
fourteenth,
so
that
perhaps
it
can
be
said
this
doesn't
involve
due
process,
certainly
not
due
process
procedurally
but
involved
the
due
process
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
incorporates
the
--
the
guarantees
in
the
first
amendment.
i
invite
your
honors'
attention
to
the
ordinance.
it
is
a
quite
brief.
it
appears
in
the
lower
half
of
page
35
of
our
opening
brief
and
i
invite
your
attention
to
page
35,
i
invite
your
attention
because
i
shall
want
to
be
arguing
in
a
moment
about
the
sweep
and
breadth
of
this
ordinance.
we
feel
that
it
was
written
not
with
fine
pen,
to
borrow
a
phrase
to
one
of
the
your
honors,
by
with
a
written
--
with
a
wide
broom
and
sweeps
in
conduct
which
that
constitution
protects.
it
provides
that
no
person
shall
distribute
any
handbill.
i
--
i
shall
interrupt
myself
as
i
read
it
if
i
may,
because
any
handbill
means
non-commercial
as
well
as
commercial,
political
as
well
as
commercial,
no
person
shall
distribute
any
handbill
clear,
in
the
street,
the
public
places,
not
at
all.
on
the
face
of
it,
the
ordinance
proscribes
the
distribution
of
any
handbill
in
any
place
under
any
circumstances
except
where
that
handbill
complies
with
certain
conditions
and
these
conditions
are
set
forth
in
sub
sections
a
and
b.
these
conditions
are
that
both
the
person
who
writes
it
or
prints
it
or
who
is
responsible
for
it
or
manufactures
it.
i
would
--
we
think
that
(a)
prefers
to
the
author
of
what
appears
in
the
leaflet
and
(b)
reaches
the
distributors
or
that
everybody
has
reached
the
person
who
carved
the
thing
to
be
distributed.
now,
they
must
place
their
name
and
address
both
of
them
in
the
conjunctive
upon
this
leaflet
in
order
to
comply
with
the
--
the
regulation
in
los
angeles.
and
if
it
turns
out
that
the
--
that
either
of
the
--
either
the
distributor
or
the
author
is
a
boundary
association
like
a
labor
union
or
a
club
which
is
come
--
and
says
here
about
a
personal
club
had
--
had
a
factitious
name
that
is
not
the
name
of
the
real
person
then
there
must
be
posted
on
the
leaflet
the
true
names
and
addresses
of
the
owners,
managers
or
agents
of
the
persons
sponsoring
the
said
handbill.
now,
i
have
said
that
we
are
attacking
the
ordinance
as
applied
and
so
let
us
look
at
the
handbills
which
constituted
the
offense
in
this
case,
they
appear
in
the
record
at
17
and
18.
they
are
two
of
them;
one
that
is
17
and
the
other
is
18
and
you
will
notice
that
it's
of
course
not
a
commercial
handbill
but
if
a
handbill
dealing
with
the
troubling
and
the
controversial
matter
of
a
proper
race
relations
and
treatment
of
racial
groups.
the
ordinance
distributed
at
a
market
urges
a
boycott
of
that
market.
i
say
the
ordinance,
i
mean
the
leaflet
because
as
the
leaflet
recites
in
the
second
or
third
paragraph.
well,
the
leaflets
is
written
or
simply
by
a
very
simple
person
and
very
simply
it
begins
by
saying,
"we
are
boycotting
the
so
and
so
market,"
and
ask
the
question
why,
they
didn't
give
us
a
reason
because
that
the
market
carries
goods
which
come
from
manufacturers
that
do
not
offer
equal
employment
opportunities
to
negroes,
mexicans
and
orientals.
and
then,
the
leaflet
concludes
with
the
announcement
prior
to
the
appearance
of
the
names
of
various
manufacturers
or
producers
that
discriminate
racially.
the
leaflet
we
cite
national
consumers
mobilization
is
boycotting
all
these
firms
as
part
of
its
program
for
fair
employment.
leaflet
number
--
second
leaflet
which
appears
on
18
is
somewhat
in
the
same
general
category.
it's
a
modest
invitation
to
its
--
for
support.
i
say
modest
because
it
urges
persons
to
send
money,
25
cents
a
month
to
this
group,
to
support
its
program
and
had
a
place
for
the
signature
of
the
person
who
is
willing
to
either
do
that
or
at
least
expresses
his
support
and
the
person
who
received
that
leaflet
and
agrees
with
the
sentiments
expressed
in
it,
sentiment
being
i
believe
that
every
man
should
have
an
equal
opportunity
for
employment,
no
matter
what
its
race,
religion
of
place
of
birth
may
send
in
his
moral
support
or
as
well
as
his
--
as
well
as
his
modest
contribution.
now,
your
honors,
central
to
the
issue
in
this
case
is
a
large
and
fascinating
historic
and
current
problem
as
to
the
place
of
anonymity
in
american
life,
in
american
literature
and
in
american
publications.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
petitioner
is
--
was
convicted
for
distributing
these
leaflets.
the
name
is
kalven.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
we
think
he
is.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
we
--
i
intent
to
come
that
later
but
i
will
answer
it
right
now.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
no
–
now
is
better
than
later.
the
record
in
this
case
--
as
to
what
happens
entirely
is
the
most
--
is
the
most
neither
of
record
it
just
couple
--
couple
of
pages
and
it
consists
essentially
of
the
leaflet
being
introduced
into
evidence
and
a
showing
that
the
defendant
was
distributing
the
leaflet
and
that
was
it.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
respondent
makes
the
argument
that
so
far
as
a
is
concern,
and
so
far
as
the
right
of
anonymity.
if
any,
of
an
author,
the
defendant
is
not
in
the
shoes
of
an
author
and
therefore
may
not
raise
the
question.
now
our
answer
is
--
is
quickly
this;
in
the
first
place,
a
reading
of
the
leaflet
discloses
that
a
distributor
might
very
well
be
the
author,
this
isn't
the
a
profound
--
these
leaflets
aren't
profound
the
treats,
it's
in
philosophy
or
essays
so
that,
it's
unlikely
that
they
--
that
the
person
who
does
the
menial
work
of
distributing
wouldn't
be
the
author.
moreover,
we
think
that
since
this
leaflet
strikes
that
of
distributor
and
makes
him
liable,
guilt
--
makes
him
guilty.
whether
the
distributor
or
the
author
doesn't
make
the
disclosure
which
the
ordinance
requires,
that
therefore,
the
distributor
in
this
case,
the
defendant
charged
with
a
crime
is
in
a
position
to
raise
the
broad
societal
rights
which
are
at
issue
and
may
as
the
seller
of
books
in
the
smith
versus
california,
just
decided
by
this
court,
protect
the
--
will
protect
the
authors
right
to
anonymity
as
well
as
his
owner.
but
in
any
event,
to
be
specific
about
it,
the
only
person
charged
with
offense
is
the
defendant
whose
conduct
consisted
of
distributing
this
leaflet.
now,
i'm
about
to
say
that
there
is
involved
in
this
case
and
the
briefs
contain
very
obvious
--
contain
interesting
in
the
respondent
brief
very
colorful
dissertations
on
the
--
on
the
nature
and
the
right
of
anonymity.
in
this
case,
the
right
of
anonymity
and
its
abstract
and
in
its
absolute
is
not
involved
because
your
honors
will
see
if
you
will
might
trouble
you
to
look
again
at
page
17
and
18,
that
the
distributor
--
that
this
leaflet
makes
no
claim
of
complete
anonymity.
on
the
contrary
at
the
(inaudible)
of
the
first
leaflet,
there
appears
the
name
of
a
group,
there
appears
an
address
not
a
resident
address
to
be
sure,
but
a
post
office
address
as
well
as
telephone
number.
and
the
same
appeared
also
on
leaflet
number
--
on
second
leaflet
which
appears
in
the
record
at
18.
so,
the
question
which
is
to
be
decided
as
we
view
it
in
this
case
is
not
broadly
and
in
the
abstract
and
in
vacuum
the
right
to
complete
anonymity,
but
whether
or
not,
the
partial
and
anonymity
to
which
this
petitioner
resorted
was
warranted
and
is
protected
by
the
constitution
under
the
particular
circumstances
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
we
do
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
alright.
when
i
think
partial
anonymity,
i
mean
this;
if
it
were
completely
anonymous,
the
reader
of
the
document
would
have
no
way
of
locating
the
author
or
the
distributor
to
be
completely
anonymous.
that
is
once
the
distribution
was
completed,
but
in
this
instance,
one
who
desires
to
communicate
with
the
distributor
certainly
or
with
the
author
may
do
so
and
he
may
do
so
by
picking
up
a
telephone
and
communicating
with
him
or
he
may
do
so
by
using
the
mail
in
order
to
do
so.
and
i
shall
urge
upon,
your
honors
tomorrow
morning
that
in
this
case,
the
critical
distinction,
the
defendant
being
unwilling
to
indicate
where
he
lives
was
completely
warranted
because
under
the
circumstances
of
this
distribution
in
los
angeles
at
that
time,
for
him
to
have
this
distributed
this
leaflet
and
indicated
where
he
lives,
may
have
meant
an
invitation
of
bricks
thrown
through
the
door
of
his
home.
and
therefore,
under
the
circumstances,
the
partial
anonymity
to
which
he
resorted
was
a
justified
and
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
now
for
a
moment
to
advert
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
is
being
reviewed
here,
an
opinion
by
the
appellate
department
of
the
los
angeles
superior
court,
which
is
the
highest
court
in
california
available
to
entertain
an
appeal.
that
court
divided
2-to-1.
it's
a
three-judge
court.
the
opinion
appears
in
the
record
at
page
27
and
following.
i
say
the
court
divided
2-to-1
which
the
presiding
judge
of
that
court,
judge
bishop
dissented.
i
think
i'd
like
to
spend
a
moment
in
the
--
if
i
may
with
your
honors'
generous
permission
in
the
--
in
a
quasi-facetious
vein
and
to
say
to
your
honor
that
the
concurrence
by
judge
swain
is
a
novelty
in
the
law
for
its
colloquialism.
it
appears
in
the
record
at
page
34,
it
is
just
half
a
dozen
or
so
lines.
and
judge
swain,
who
is
a
--
an
eminent
jurist
in
an
oxford
--
an
ex-oxford
scholar,
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama
as
he
did
in
bryant
versus
zimmerman
involving
the
ku
klux
klan,
and
he
thought
that
two
decisions
were
contradictory
and
the
only
distinction
he
saw
between
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
the
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama,
the
earlier
case,
is
that
one
case,
the
--
the
former
dealt
with
good
guys
and
the
earlier
one
dealt
with
bad
guys
or
he
put
it
a
little
bit
more
scholarly,
he
said
the
former
dealt
with
--
then
it
should
be
dealt
with
good
guys,
in
the
latter
with
wicked
men.
apparently,
he
had
been
looking
at
westerns
on
t.v.
and
he
was
drawing
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
yes.
well,
as
an
advocate
of
liberty,
i
--
i
support
the
right
of
oxford
men
under
all
circumstances.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now,
i
would
say
oxford
men
above
all
others,
next
to
harvard
men.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right.
[laughter]
many
event
now,
to
be
--
to
be
serious,
if
i
may,
the
appellate
department
of
the
los
angeles
superior
court,
the
majority
considered
the
justifications
for
the
ordinance
and
the
warrant
part
and
justify
the
ordinance
on
the
ground
that
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance
was
to
provide
a
means
for
fixing
responsibility
for
abuses.
now,
i
must
say
right
now
that
so
far
as
the
appellate
department
of
superior
court
is
concern,
and
so
far
as
this
--
the
respondent
city
of
los
angeles
up
to
its
brief
in
this
court,
there
was
no
spelling
out
either
in
detail
or
otherwise
as
to
what
these
allegedly
abuses
against
with
this
ordinance
was
saying
were.
the
appellate
department,
in
affirming
the
judgment,
contended
itself
with
using
the
word
“abuse”
in
generality.
the
appellate
department
pointed
to
no
findings
by
the
city
council
reciting
specific
abuses
because
there
were
no
findings
by
the
city
council.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
not
too
sure.
but
it
is
some
years
--
some
years
old,
i
would
say,
15,
20
years
old.
mr.
grey,
who
is
city
attorney,
i
was
fearful,
i
might
be
asked
that
and
i
just
didn't
--
didn't
get
ready
for
that.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
is
no
history
at
all.
there
was
no
--
well,
in
the
first
place,
this
was
adopted
by
the
city
council
of
los
angeles.
it's
an
--
its
functioning
is
--
is
informal
and
we
know
of
no
legislative
history
so
far
as
that
ordinance
is
concern.
and
in
any
event,
certainly,
no
legislative
history
was
offered
to
any
of
the
court
below.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
no
contemporaneous
incidents
at
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
--
i
have
to
answer
your
honor's
question
in
this
modified
form,
that
in
any
event,
no
contemporaneous
incidents
as
supporting
the
ordinance
as
of
the
time
the
ordinance
was
adopted
was
--
were
proffered
to
any
of
the
court
below
and
the
appellate
department
upheld
the
ordinance.
and
this
--
on
this
general
claim
that
it
was
directed
to
abuses,
and
also,
took
the
position
that
after
all,
no
ordinance
was
--
came
before
a
court
armed
with
the
presumption
of
validity,
and
it
was
contented
to
follow
this
presumption
even
though
this
is
an
ordinance
directly
aimed
at
the
expression
of
opinion
with
respect
to
which
there
maybe
considerable
argument
as
to
whether
that
kind
of
an
ordinance
had
a
presumption
of
constitutionality.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
let
me
say
now
that
our
essential
attack
is
on
the
ordinance
as
it
is
applied,
we
do
also
attack
it
on
its
face.
and
i
will
deal
with
that
--
with
that
towards
the
conclusion
of
my
--
my
presentation.
but
our
central
complaint
is
that
the
ordinance
as
applied
violates
the
first
amendment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
know
of
no
such
analog.
and
here
again,
no
such
analog
was
called
to
the
attention
of
any
of
the
courts
below.
and
it
--
so
far
as
we
know,
it
is
--
it
is
a
novelty
in
the
law
but
--
but
here
again,
we
could
be
quite
entirely
mistaken.
i
have
said
that
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
by
the
presiding
judge,
which
opinion
appears
in
the
record
at
page
34.
i
may
say
to
your
honors
that
judge
bishop
has
been
a
judge
of
the
los
angeles
superior
court
for
some
40
or
45
years.
he
expressly
noted
in
his
dissent
that
there
were
relatively
few
instances
where
there
had
been
an
abuse
with
respect
to
the
distribution
of
--
of
leaflets.
and
as
i
say,
he
had
been
on
the
bench
for
many
years
and
may
be
deemed
to
be
a
person
who
was
reasonably
conversant
with
what
were
matters
of
common
knowledge
in
that
community.
he
--
he
looked
at
the
other
judges
on
--
on
the
leaflets
and
he
expressed
the
view
which
appears
in
the
record
at
36,
a
view
with
respect
to
which
there
can
be,
i
think,
no
dispute.the
leaflets
here
were
plainly
not
obscene,
libelous
nor
otherwise
an
abuse
of
the
right
of
free
speech
and
of
the
press.
and
he
expressed
the
view
which
we
share
that
the
requirement
of
the
fixing
upon
a
leaflet
to
be
distributed
anywhere
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
of
the
names
and
addresses,
both
of
the
author
and
the
distributor,
was
not
merely
as
he
put
it
a
technical
requirement
but
was
a
--
a
serious
inroad
upon
freedom
of
expression.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
would
your
honor
let
me
answer
that
in
just
about
two
minutes?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
well,
i
--
i
certainly
intend
to
--
to
answer
that
question.
but
i
--
i
would
like
to
do
it
in
a
moment
and
do
it,
if
i
may,
may
i?
all
right.
i
want
to
say
now
that
instances
of
vigilantism
and
vandalism
and
violence,
and
i
think
i'm
beginning
to
answer
your
honor's
question
right
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
were
called
to
the
attention
of
the
superior
court
and
the
courts
below.
the
majority
of
the
court
may
know
reference
to
them
but
judge
bishop
did
and
he
said
in
his
opinion,
it
appears
in
the
record
at
35
that
one
who
sees
an
evil,
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
mid-paragraph
on
page
35,
and
i
shall
quote
it,
“one
who
sees
an
evil
against
which
he
would
strike
by
written
criticism
will
refrain
from
doing
so
because
of
what
he
believes
to
be
sure
consequences
to
himself
and
family
if
his
name
appears
on
the
panel.”
in
other
words,
therefore,
we
are
talking
about,
at
least
judge
bishop
was,
of
sure
consequences
which
befalls
a
person
who
distributes
a
leaflet
in
behalf
of
a
minority
group,
protesting
racial
discrimination
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
and
then
he
went
on
to
say,
the
right
freely
to
use
the
printed
word
is
not
limited
to
those
so
moved
that
they
will
act
regardless
of
the
consequences.
in
just
another
moment,
i
want
to
discuss
with
your
honors
what
these
consequences
are.
in
short,
judge
bishop
took
a
view,
a
view
which
we
share
that
freedom
of
the
press
including,
of
course,
distribution
of
leaflets,
is
not
limited
to
heroes.
it
is
not
only
for
the
stout
of
heart
but
is
also
for
the
timid
and
the
faint
hearted.
now,
that
leads
me
to
answer
your
honor
--
justice
whittaker's
question
more
specifically
and
more
directly.
we
have,
as
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
referred
to
reports
made
by
an
official
agency
of
the
county
of
los
angeles,
an
agency
appointed,
it
--
the
matter
refer
--
it
appears
at
page
--
at
page
12
of
our
reply
brief.
we
have
referred
to
findings
and
comments
made
by
an
official
agency
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
appointed
by
the
board
of
supervisors
of
the
county
pursuant
to
an
official
ordinance.
i
may
say
to
your
honors
and
particularly
to
justice
frankfurter
that
what
he
have
done
here,
is
followed
a
pattern
which
was
used
in
the
beauharnais
case,
in
the
beauharnais
case,
the
court,
through
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
referred
to
findings
by
a
commission
of
the
city
of
chicago
on
human
relations
with
respect
to
racial
tensions
in
that
community,
indeed,
there
is
a
memorandum
filed
in
that
case
as
to
racial
tensions
relying
upon
the
findings
made
by
that
commission
and
the
memorandum
indicates
that
it
was
filed
at
the
request
of
justice
frankfurter
during
the
oral
argument
and
also
the
suggestion
of
--
of
justice
black.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
yes,
indeed.
and
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
quite
--
quite
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
quite
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
quite
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
except
for
this,
your
honor.
the
leaflets
themselves,
clearly
on
their
face,
deal
entirely
with
the
problem
of
racial
matters.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
indeed,
if
i
may
say
so.
this
is
exact
--
this
is
precisely
what
we're
saying
and
indeed,
we
are
saying
that
the
court
need
do
no
more
that
the
court
needn't
reach,
though
we
think
it
could,
needn't
to
reach
to
the
ordinance
in
terms
of
its
validity,
consonant
with
due
process
and
--
on
its
face.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
no.
we
are
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
i
am
saying
there
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
no.
i'm
going
to
say
something
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
let
me
explain.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
i
explain
it?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
i
explain
it?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now,
may
i
explain
it,
sir?
all
right.
we
are
attacking
this
ordinance,
which
we
admit,
on
its
face,
as
not
restricted
to
racial
matters
but
which
is
broadly
drafted
so
that
it
might
apply
to
a
leaflet
affecting
racial
matters.
we
are
attacking
this
ordinance
as
applied
to
the
petitioner
of
the
instance
--
in
the
instant
case.
and
in
the
instant
case
we
say,
the
particular
leaflets,
which
resulted
in
a
conviction
of
the
defendant,
pertained
to
racial
matters,
this
appears
clearly
on
their
face,
and
then
we
are
saying
as
applied,
a
balancing
of
the
--
of
the
interest
of
the
city
on
the
one
hand
and
now,
i'm
talking
only
as
applied.
in
the
interest
of
freedom
of
communication
and
hence,
the
possible
incidents
of
injury
to
the
distributor
are
factors
which
this
court
may
properly
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
on
balance
as
applied
to
this
petitioner
with
respect
solely
to
these
particular
leaflets,
there
has
been
an
abridgement
of
freedom
of
the
press.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
because
--
because
of
a
particular
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
and
i'm
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
prepared
--
indeed.
i'm
not
--
not
only
do
i
--
do
i
not
--
can
i
not
escape
it,
i
have
no
desire
to
escape
it
and
this
is
my
argument
and
my
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
i'm
not
arguing
merely
that.
i'm
arguing
that
it
may
not
be
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
--
let
me
just
say
this,
your
honor.
i
am
definitely
and
unequivocally
taking
the
position
that
although
this
ordinance
may
be
valid
on
its
face
and
may
be
valid
as
apply
to
others,
as
apply
to
the
petitioner
in
these
particular
circumstances,
it
--
it
offends
due
process.
and
i'd
like
to
develop
that
argument
by
saying
to
your
honor
that
the
circumstances
upon
which
we
rely
as
the
result
of
which
we
make
the
argument
that
is
applied
to
the
petitioner
and
to
the
distribution
of
this
leaflet,
offended
free
press
and
hence,
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
as
follows.
and
as
i
say,
we
have
indicated
in
our
--
in
our
--
in
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
references
to
official
reports
made
by
a
commission
of
the
county
los
angeles
on
human
relations,
a
commission
especially
set
up
in
order
to
investigate
racial
tensions
and
attempt
to
alleviate
them.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
i
am
not
even
contending
that
it
is
applied
--
that
the
ordinance
is
always
applied
though
we
know
--
have
no
knowledge
about
the
application
to
raise
racial
matters.
i
am
merely
contending
that
whatever
may
be
the
application
of
the
ordinance
to
other
persons
under
other
circumstances,
the
application
of
this
ordinance
to
this
petitioner
under
these
particular
circumstances,
offends
due
process
of
freedom
of
the
press.
and
in
connection
with
that,
the
limited
argument
though,
we
will
also,
in
a
moment,
challenge
the
ordinance
on
its
face,
but
at
the
moment,
i'm
merely
arguing
the
ordinance
as
applied.
we
have
called
to
your
honors'
attention
incidents
of
racial
tension
which
appear,
as
i
say,
in
the
appendix
and
which
are
to
the
general
effect
that
there
have
been
instances
of
a
mob
action
against,
it
appears
for
instance
on
page
13
of
our
memorandum,
against
--
against
negroes.
there
have
been
attempted
arson
cases
against
persons
of
the
negro
race.
there
has
been
--
we
do
not
claim
that
--
that
los
angeles
is
little
rock.
we
do
not
claim
that
california
is
arkansas.
we
do
not
claim
the
kind
of
tensions
which
we
set
some
communities
have
appeared
in
the
violent
and
--
and
such
serious
form
in
los
angeles.
but
we
do
say
that
the
record
does
show
from
the
finding
of
this
commission
that
there
had
been
cross
burnings
and
egg
throwing
and
smashing
of
windows
and
the
setting
of
--
of
fires.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
is
--
it
is
not
proof
before
the
state
court.
it
is
a
matter
which
was
proffered
as
a
part
of
our
argument
to
the
court
below,
and
it
is
a
matter
which
is
set
forth
in
official
documents
of
the
commission
with
--
the
originals
of
which
we
have
filed
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
and
which
are
summarized
in
the
appendix
to
this
brief.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
is
in
this
respect.
when
a
person
speaking
from
the
stand,
he
ordinarily
speaking
in
--
in
either
in
broad
daylight
or
at
least
where
he
can
be
seen
and
where
persons
are
about
in.
the
vice
of
this
ordinance
if
it
is
assumed
that
these
--
that
these
leaflets
do
not
comply
with
it,
these
leaflets
do
have
a
post
office
address
and
do
have
a
telephone
number,
as
which
the
person
may
be
reached.
the
vice
of
this
ordinance
is
that
it
requires
a
person,
not
only
to
identify
himself
when
he
is
addressing
the
group,
as
the
speaker
does
all
the
walking,
the
speaker
had
a
--
in
high
park
or
in
a
public
square
may
not
even
identify
himself,
he
gets
up
and
talks
and
the
group
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
you
see
him.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
the
problem
here
is
that
if
this
petitioner
left
his
address,
which
this
ordinance
requires
on
the
leaflet,
he
would
be
giving
information
to
those
who
are
unfriendly
to
him
which
information
could
be
used
by
them.
when
he
isn't
at
his
home
through
vandalism
at
night
and
through
acts
of
reprisal
which
could
be
visited
upon
him
in
a
manner
which
are
not
visited
ordinarily
upon
a
person
at
a
place
where
he
is
making
his
public
speech.
and
so
what
we
are
saying
is
that
in
this
instance,
under
these
circumstances,
the
strict
requirement
of
this
ordinance
go
beyond
any
necessity
and
in
beyond
any
justification
because
it
requires
the
person
who
distributes
the
ordinance
to
indicate
where
his
address
is
at
which
a
cross
maybe
burned
at
night
at
which
eggs
maybe
thrown
at
night
or
at
times
when
he
isn't
there.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
not.
i
would
agree
that
an
ordinance
which
is
narrowly
drafted
to
deal
with
particular
situations
as
for
instance
with
the
matter
--
with
the
matter
of
-
of
libel
might
and
could
very
well
be
valid
whereas
an
ordinance
which
is
drafted
as
broadly
as
this
one,
namely,
which
proscribes
the
distribution
of
handbills
under
any
circumstances,
any
place
in
the
city,
that
such
an
ordinance
is
first
to
sweeping
on
its
face.
and
then,
because
it
is
sweeping
on
its
face
and
permits
the
kind
of
prosecution
in
this
case,
violates
due
process
in
application.
but
i
will
say
to
your
honor
that
this
particular
matter
that
you
are
questioning
me
about
is
a
manner
about
which
my
young
colleague
has
been
preparing
for
some
days,
and
i
would
like
now
to
reserve
some
time
for
--
for
rebuttal
and
yield
to
him,
with
the
admonition
to
him,
that
he
begin
by
answering
more
fully
or
well,
more
adequately,
the
question
which
your
honor
just
propounded
to
me.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
was
none.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
was
none.
it
is
a
matter
which
we
call
to
the
court's
attention
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
in
the
community
and
which
we
are
calling
to
your
attention,
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
in
the
community
through
official
reports
of
the
commission.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
respect
to
a
question
put
to
mr.
grey
by
the
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
the
other
leaflets
which
were
introduced
in
evidence,
the
leaflets
are
the
very
market
which
was
being
opposed
by
these
practices
we're
concern.
clearly,
they
were
a
violation
of
the
letter
and
the
requirements
of
the
ordinance.
one
of
them
had
no
identification
of
any
kind.
there
was
a
stipulation
that
in
the
supermarket
was
a
--
was
a
fictitious
or
organization
that's
in
the
record
and
that
mr.
grey
says,
well,
the
second
one,
had
the
name
of
the
printer
but
to
comply
with
this
ordinance,
you
have
to,
not
only
have
the
name
of
the
printer
and
its
address,
but
also
the
name
of
the
distributor
or
distributors
and
their
address.
so,
clearly
there
was
--
there
was
no
complain.
now,
let
me
move
on,
however,
to
more
--
perhaps
not
maybe
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
certainly.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
believe
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
true.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
--
i
--
i
would
say
that's
in
the
disjunctive.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
--
that's
true.
but
i
will
also
say,
though
i
don't
know
what
i'm
answering
your
question,
that
the
last
clause
in
(b),
probably
applies
also
to
(a).
in
other
words,
if
either
the
writer
or
printer
or
the
distributor
or
the
one
who
cause
the
distribution
is
a
volunteer
association
or
a
nonliving
identifiable
person,
that
there
must
be
a
statement
of
who
the
persons
are
and
their
addresses.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
would
it?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
--
i
have
troubled
enough
--
i
have
troubled
enough
without
using
a
strange
reading
and
then
so
i'll
--
i'll
not
make
that
argument
but
go
on
--
go
on
to
another.
now,
then,
i
think
now,
your
honors,
there
is
a
serious
difference
in
--
in
our
understanding
and
in
the
city's
understanding
of
the
effect
of
the
first
amendment
with
respect
to
legislation,
and
i'll
try
to
clarify
the
difference
and
understanding
by
stating
our
position.
we
take
the
position
that
an
ordinance
which
is
directed
against
the
expression
of
opinion
must
be
drafted
more
narrowly
than
an
ordinance
which
is
directed
against
other
matters.
we
say
that
with
respect
to
the
expression
of
opinion,
freedom
is
the
rule,
exception
abuse
that
--
restraint
of
the
exception.
we
say
that
if
a
city
wants
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
the
distribution
of
leaflets
during
election
campaigns
where
there
may
be
an
abuse,
it
must
draft
an
ordinance
which
is
directed
toward
that
specific
or
nearly
related
abuse.
and
if
a
city
or
any
other
state
or
the
congress
wants
to
deal
with
a
situation
to
a
particular
abuse
like
lobbying,
it
must
draft
an
ordinance
directed
--
directly
towards
that
specific
view,
the
matter
of
lobbying,
and
to
return
to
mr.
justice
whittaker,
if
it
--
if
a
city
or
congress
wants
to
limit
the
expression
of
opinion
in
situations
involving
libel
by
requiring
identification,
the
ordinance
must
be
narrowly
drafted
directed
to
that
evil.
and
we
do
not
agree
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
let
--
if
--
but
--
but
let
me
just
make
my
generalized
statement
that
is,
we
do
not
agree
that
an
ordinance
which
is
broad
and
pervasive
and
comprehensive
in
as
restraint
upon
opinion
and
hence
can
be
applied
as
it
was
in
this
case
as
to
this
--
as
to
this
petitioner
is
valid
even
though
the
ordinance
more
narrowly
drawn
could
legitimately
and
without
violating
the
first
amendment
had
directed
itself
towards
specific
evils.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
in
--
in
my
opinion,
the
--
the
ordinance
would
have
to
be
directed
towards
the
evil.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
will
answer
your
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
would
not
be
specific.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
in
other
words,
your
honor,
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
ordinance
upon
its
face
should
also
be
narrowly
drafted.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
because
this
--
this
ordinance
is
--
is
drafted
so
broadly
as
to
sweep
within
its
ambit,
persons
who
distributed
leaflets
that
are
in
no
way
connected
with
the
alleged
evil
of
libel.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
would
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
would
be
a
ridiculous.
but
an
ordinance
could
say
that
leaflets
which
pertained
to
or
make
comment
upon
other
persons
shall
have
the
name
of
the
author
or
publisher
or
distributor
appear
upon
it.
and
indeed,
that
or
they
put
it
this
way,
originally,
this
ordinance
was
limited
to
a
particular
evil,
the
matter
of
commercial
organizations
engaging
in
false
advertising.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no
--
no.
i'm
--
i'm
moving
along.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
of
course
not.
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that
as
the
matter
of
fact
originally,
this
ordinance
was
care
--
reasonably
carefully
drafted,
dealing
with
a
particular
evil,
the
matter
of
false
advertising
and
hence
was
limited
to
commercial
leaflets.
and
of
course,
if
that's
where
the
ordinance
remain,
we
wouldn't
have
this
case.
but
when
the
ordinance
was
so
broad
as
to
encompass
the
leaflet
here,
we
do
have
this
case
and
then
we
gave
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
and
just
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
do
i
have
another
second
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
reason
there
is
no
discussion
is
because
the
city
concedes
that
this
ordinance
does
not
apply
to
commercial
leaflets
and
also
concedes
that
a
different
rule
would
apply
to
commercial
leaflets
than
to
none
--
none
--
that
to
a
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
must
say
i
do.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
that
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
no
one
claims
it's
commercial.
now,
may
--
do
i
have
one
second
and
it
so
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honor,
i
--
i
certainly
do.
i
think
the
right
to
discuss
political
matters
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
all
right,
just
one
pile
of
word.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
that
just
lately,
mr.
justice
brennan
in
smith
versus
california,
los
angeles
ordinance,
restored
to
vitality
thornhill
versus
alabama,
which
says
that
when
an
ordinance
is
directed
against
opinion,
it
--
the
rule
requires
that
the
ordinance
should
be
--
should
be
narrowly
drafted
and
that
a
person
who
is
victimized
by
a
prosecution
may
challenge
the
ordinance
on
its
face
because
it
affords
opportunities
for
oppression
as
well
as
real
oppression.
we
think
we
have
in
this
case
not
only
the
opportunity
for
oppression
and
discrimination
but
also
real
oppression
and
discrimination.
the
red
light
says
i
should
sit
down.
