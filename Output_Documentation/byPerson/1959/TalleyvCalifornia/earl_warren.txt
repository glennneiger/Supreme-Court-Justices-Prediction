i
notice
--
i
notice
within
the
record
are
some
leaflets
that
emanate
from
the
company
which
--
which
the
petitioner
was
circulating
his
petition
against.
and
i
notice
also
that
--
that
these
do
not
fulfill
the
requirements
of
this
--
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
ordinance
anymore
than
--
than
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
--
does
that
fulfill
the
obligation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
doesn't
this
--
doesn't
this
one
have
--
have
a
name
of
some
organization
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
unless
when
it
have
a
post
office
box?
doesn't
it
have
a
telephone
number
wherein
as
that
different
from
--
from
these?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
--
do
they
enforce
it
as
against
this
kind
of
--
of
leaflet?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
it
rather
common
way
for
--
for
some
stores
to
advertise
their
sales
and
so
forth
by
--
by
leaflets
like
these
was
the
--
merely
was
the
name
of
the
store,
not
the
name
of
any
orders
or
--
or
anybody
else
connected
with
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
if
the
--
if
the
police
feel
they
know
who
put
these
things
out,
they
don't
pay
any
attention
to
the
ordinance
and
if
they
--
if
they
don't,
why
they
do,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
old
is
the
ordinance?
