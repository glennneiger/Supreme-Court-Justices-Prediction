when
is
the
time
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
was
this
case
tried
out
on
the
merits
of
law
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
pleadings?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
expressed
the
general
equity
of
principles
as
testifying
the
application
of
the
statute
to
the
existing
action.
do
you
think
that
such
section
can
be
read,
the
--
the
amendment
into
subsection
(c)
can
be
read
as
explicit
--
explicitly
providing
for
that?
it
refers
to
any
proceeding
instituted
under
subsection
(c),
subsection
(c)
existing
before
the
amendment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
this
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
do
you
have
to
go
to
that?
that's
my
question.
why
doesn't
the
section
provide
for
that?
well,
i
get
the
same
result
either
way
i
grant
you
but
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
is
clear
that
it
applies
for
international.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
didn't
mention
it
that
the
reason
