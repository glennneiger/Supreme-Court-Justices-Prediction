not
only
a
proper
but
a
(inaudible)
as
i
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
state
wasn't
made
a
party,
wasn't
it
originally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
no
--
no
additions
--
no
additional
party
--
and
in
the
--
the
pleadings
need
not
be
changed
at
all
except
to
release
or
dismiss
the
individual
defendants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
is
actually
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
is
now
before
us
as
a
party
by
your
complaint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
ground
of
dismissing
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
not
explicitly
--
was
not
explicitly
directed
against
(inaudible)
was
not
included
in
the
1957
act
as
to
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
merely
argumentatively
served
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
wasn't
a
suggestion
to
the
--
and
what
you've
answered
a
minute
ago,
it
wasn't
a
suggestion
that
no
decree
could
be
directed
against
the
state
if
it
--
if
it
either
was
recalcitrant
or
denied
the
authority
of
the
court
but
merely
that
the
statute
did
not
authorize
a
decree
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
yes
but
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
so
far
as
your
position
--
so
far
as
the
government
position
here
is
concerned,
assuming
one
agrees
with
you,
that
the
case
may
be
decided
it
would
be
an
equity
suit,
as
of
the
--
as
--
on
the
state
of
the
law
as
of
the
time
that
the
decree
is
sought
to
be
entered
or
asked
for.
is
--
are
you
going
to
argue
here
the
question
of
power
on
the
part
of
congress
to
direct
such
a
decree
being
entered
against
the
state
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
is
clear,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
is
that
contested
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that
this
is
--
there's
no
contest
that
the
statute
said
what
it
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
are
you
--
are
you
going
to
present
to
the
court
or
do
you
conceive
that
to
be
a
problem
before
the
court
whether
assuming
everything
you
say
about
equitable
matters,
the
legislation
of
the
other
there,
1960,
does
authorize
that
the
constitution
constitutionally
permit
a
decree
to
the
end
of
--
in
this
suit
and
the
case
goes
back
on
the
merits
against
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you're
asking
is
that
the
decree
of
dismissal
be
--
be
reversed
and
the
case
go
back
as
a
case
on
the
pleadings
solely
against
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
state
to
be
retained
as
a
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
that
for
--
i
noticed
you're
going
to
quarrel
that,
isn't
it?
i
feel
you're
about
to
close
your
brief.
i
assume
you
--
you've
said
all
there
is
to
be
said
in
the
opening
with
all
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
of
a
speculation
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
not
within
their
power
even
to
sign
it
to
veto.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
you
are
not
joining
their
field,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
surely
there's
a
decisive
difference
between
rice
and
this
case.
in
rice,
the
--
there
was
no
such
situation
of
a
new
statute
concerning
the
claim
that
was
ambiguously
urged
or
ambiguously
sustainable
under
the
prior
situation.
but
here
is
a
confirming
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
view
of
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
confirming
the
statute,
the
government
have
argued
a
basic
complaint
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
on
an
argumentative
--
on
an
a
elaborate
argumentative.
of
course,
the
brief,
the
--
that
the
state
is
impliedly
covered
in
the
reach
of
the
1957
act.
along
comes
congress
and
i
quite
agree
with
you,
at
the
moment,
we
are
talking
about
a
--
a
measure
that
isn't
law
though
i
think
it's
very
real
to
assume
it
will
not
be
law
without
--
within
not
more
than
ten
days
from
whatever
today
was
and
doctrine
was
just
put
on
further,
instead.
and
this
is
confirming
legislation
that
so
often
we've
had
in
the
past
an
affirming
legislation
taking
away
the
ambiguities
of
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
a
little
of
accounts
of
the
loss
of
memory
by
an
old
man.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
statute
did
is
against
--
one
of
the
statutes
did
in
the
relation
of
the
second
related
statute
to
the
prior
situation
makes
all
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
if
you
adhere
to
a
state
whether
you
would
deny
that
on
its
face,
42
u.s.c.
1971
(c)
on
its
face,
i'm
not
--
not
requiring
to
questions
of
constitutionality
but
on
its
face
that
is
a
congressional
authorization
for
making
the
state
a
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
i
mean
of
1960,
no,
no,
no.
the
1957
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
1957
act
is
a
debatable
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
my
question
is
whether
you're
here
to
state
whether
the
1971
(c)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
move,
takes
that
out
of
debate
and
is
explicit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
mean
does
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
a
constitutional
question.
so
that,
there
are
so
many
aspects
of
it,
your
honor.
it's
almost
difficult
to
debate
extemporaneously
and
that's
what
we
are
asked
to
do
today
where
this
is
a
--
came
as
completely
as
a
surprise
to
--
to
us,
i
might
say,
because
we
expected
to
--
to
argue
the
case
as
it
had
been
presented
by
the
questions
and
brief.
and
we
--
but
we
do
urge
that
in
view
of
the
changed
circumstances,
this
particular
case
is
no
longer,
will
be
--
it
will
no
longer
be
controlling
on
the
broad
scope
of
the
law.
is
--
it
will
be
controlling
only
as
far
as
these
particular
parties
are
concerned
and
it
has
no
--
has
no
national
scope
or
significance.
and
we
feel
like
that
no
hardship
would
be
done,
anyone
by
dismissing
the
writ
of
certiorari
because
if
they
have
a
valid
case
and
intend
to
push
it
which
i'm
sure
that
they
intend
to
push
from
they
said
today,
they
can
bring
it
over
again.
if
we
have
a
right
to
plead
to
this
--
in
the
same
suit
below
again,
no
additional
time
it
seems
to
us,
would
be
lost
at
all
except
just
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
first
--
the
first
suit.
