chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
counsel
for
the
respondent
agrees
or
disagrees
with
your
proposal
to
dispose
of
the
case
in
this
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
i
don't
want
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
madison.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
case
having
been
merely
dismissed
if
the
government
does
not
proceed
--
try
to
proceed
further
against
your
clients
that,
only
against
the
state.
there
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
any
bar
to
your
raising
every
constitutional
question
down
there,
would
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
the
solicitor
general
has
asked
us
to
hold
it
in
this
case
that
--
that
in
--
in
his
present
posture
that
the
1957
act
so
provided.
he
is
relying
on
the
1960
act.
isn't
that
correct
of
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
that's
what
--
that's
what
you
can
raise
down
below,
cant
you?
i
see
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
took
it
from
the
solicitor
general
that
he
made
no
such
contention
that
he
felt
he
would
open
to
that.
i
may
ask
the
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
way
i
understood
your
position.
now,
do
--
do
you
feel
you're
under
any
limitation
in
those
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
point
--
point
is
that
--
that
those
should
be
raised
down
below
and
they
should
have
the
scrutiny
of
the
district
court
and
then
have
the
scrutiny
of
the
court
of
appeals
before
they
come
to
us.
because
it
is
not
our
practice
and
--
and
i
don't
think
you
would
urge
that
upon
us
would
you,
to
--
to
take
the
constitutional
questions,
ab
initio
in
this
in
this
--
in
this
court
without
getting
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
that
--
i
--
i
would
think
that
that
proposal
of
the
solicitor
general
would
--
would
then
give
the
right
to
the
lower
courts
to
do
exactly
that
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hare.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
act
says
so,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
further
gentlemen?
very
well.
