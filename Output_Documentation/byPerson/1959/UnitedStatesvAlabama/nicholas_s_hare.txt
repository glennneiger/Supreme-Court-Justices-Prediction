mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
sir,
i
have
only
one
thing
to
argue
or
rather
to
add.
i
think
the
--
the
case
now
has
become
one
that
it
is
abstract.
my
argument
which
was
devoted
to
showing
as
best
i
knew
how,
that
the
state
of
alabama
could
not
have
been
made
a
proper
party
under
the
1957
amendment,
is
no
longer
before
your
honors
in
view
of
the
statement
of
the
counsel
for
the
other
side
that
he
is
willing
to
rest
completely
on
a
speculative
possibility
that
the
new
act
may
become
law.
so,
that
reason
--
nothing
really
for
me
to
argue
with
reference
to
the
inapplicability
of
the
1957
amendment
to
an
injunction
against
the
state.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
well
i
noticed
that
the
n.a.a.c.p.
is
greatly
distressed
about
it
being
only
half
a
loaf
and
would
apparently
prefer
that
the
half
loaf
be
rejected
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
full
loaf.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
but
they
seem
to
have
considerable
voice.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
now,
that
the
point
--
the
point
which
i
wish
to
make
is
this.
that
in
this
particular
argument,
in
this
particular
decision
which
addresses
itself
to
this
court
which
is
in
the
nature
of
a
review
of
two
lower
court
opinions,
and
not
anything
really
not
to
review
something
that
is
speculated
that
we
are
arguing
on
today.
if
this
case,
this
argument
and
the
case
itself
has
--
if
not
become
moot
has
become
one
of
limited
importance.
because
assuming
that
the
new
law
will
come
into
effect,
they
will
travel
under
the
new
law,
some
aspects
of
the
new
law
which
were
entirely
different
from
the
old
like
the
referee,
the
referee
section
which
enables
the
district
court
to
appoint
referees
to
oversee
voting
registration.
now,
that
in
itself
might
make
it
inappropriate
to
take
such
an
unusual
step
as
enjoining
a
state
in
a
governmental
function.
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
enjoin
a
state.
and
the
only
prayer
in
the
present
bill
is
a
prayer
for
an
injunction
which
apparently
has
mandatory
injunction
effect.
but
it's
not
necessary.
it
won't
be
necessary
under
the
new
bill.
they
can
--
they
can
get
all
the
relief
they
want
by
the
voter
registrar
section
of
the
new
bill.so
the
point
of
it
is,
there
are
so
many
things
to
be
considered
that
it
--
it
seems
to
me
like
this
court
could
well
say
that
due
to
the
intervening
circumstance,
that
is
a
passage
of
this
law,
and
due
to
the
present
limited,
very
limited
importance
of
this
particular
case
because
it
couldn't
affect
another
case
anywhere
in
the
united
states
anymore.
because
of
--
assuming
the
new
act
will
pass,
whether
or
not
the
state
under
the
1957
amendment
could
be
made
a
party
would
never
arise
again.
so
i
say
due
to
this
limited
importance
now,
the
court
should
exercise
its
discretion
as
it
has
done
many
times
in
the
past
and
in
particular,
the
case
which
my
associate
mentioned,
rice
versus
sioux
city
cemetery
where
they
said,
“due
to
the
isolated
significance
of
this
particular
piece
of
litigation,
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
deemed
to
be
improvidently
granted
and
the
writ
was
denied.”
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
a
confirming
statute.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
from
the
view
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
your
honor,
with
reference
to
the
sioux
city
cemetery
case
that
your
honor
is
more
familiar
with
than
any
other
living
human
beings
since
its
--
to
you
maybe
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
[laughs]
in
that
case
it
was
interesting
that
a
statute
had
been
passed
after
the
beginning
of
the
suit.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
and
to
that
extent,
it's
just
about
as
close
as
you'll
find
one,
but
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
now,
but
we
take
the
position
that
the
--
this
could
not
be
a
confirmatory
--
could
not
be
a
confirmatory
action
because
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
last
word
on
the
subject
had
sustained
the
lower
court.
that
the
state
could
not
be
made
a
party
and
that
was
the
status
of
the
law
prior
to
the
argument
before
congress.
so
it's
a
new
thing.
it's
a
new
thing.
so
in
effect,
this
might
--
you
might
say
the
law,
assuming
that
it
becomes
a
law,
does
permit
in
same
instances,
suit
against
states.
in
same
instances,
we
will
--
we
--
we
must
be
sure
that
the
particular
bill
of
complaint
or
the
particular
complaint
that
they
have
is
applicable
to
this
particular
new
section.
so,
that's
why
we
feel
that
the
case
should
be
started
over
completely.
it
won't
be
in
a
hardship
as
we
see
it
to
anybody.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
you
mean
form
the
old
act
of
the
1957
act,
sir?
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
--
it's
this
specifically.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that's
what
is
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
we
say,
sir
that
that
does
--
that
is
explicit,
now.
however,
it
does
not
raise
the
question.
it
doesn't
go
to
some
of
the
essential
questions
such
as,
does
that
confer
jurisdiction,
only
a
district
court
could
do
that.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that's
right.
well,
--
well
then
does
it
remove
original
jurisdiction
from
this
court
to
do
that?
