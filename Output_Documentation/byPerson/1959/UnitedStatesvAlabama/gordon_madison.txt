mr.
gordon
madison
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
honorable
members
of
this
court.
we
came
to
prepare
to
argue
with
two
different
parts
of
this
case.
one
related
to
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
sue
the
respondent,
rogers
and
livingston
who
at
that
time
the
suit
was
filed
had
resigned
under
alabama
law,
had
resigned
under
the
common
law.
their
resignations
had
been
accepted.
they
had
accepted
other
officers
of
profit
under
the
state
and
that
part
of
the
argument
had
fallen
to
me.
the
other
part
of
the
argument
was
to
be
presented
by
mr.
hare,
assistant
attorney
general
of
alabama
which
dealt
with
the
right
of
the
united
states
on
the
1957
civil
rights
act
to
bring
a
suit
against
the
state
of
alabama,
more
specifically,
whether
a
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
such
a
suit
under
the
1957
act.
now,
mr.
rankin's
secretary
called
our
office
on
friday
and
relayed
to
me
the
substance
of
a
memorandum
or
note
which
he
has
written
to
the
court,
as
they
had
to
learn
you
could
do
that.
and
we
were
furnished
with
a
copy
when
we
arrive
here,
sunday
afternoon,
at
our
hotel.
and
in
order
to
properly
analyze
the
ramifications
of
what
we
might
do
here
today
in
this
argument
or
what
we
might
agree
to
on
the
assumption
that
the
president
will
sign
the
law,
i
believe
he
will.
but
as
of
today,
it
is
not
law
and
we
don't
know
what
he
will
do.
so
far
as
--
as
that
the
court
will
bear
with
me
a
few
minutes,
i
would
like
to
point
out
because
i
don't
know
what
you
all
will
do,
will
you
with
agree
the
solicitor
general,
which
of
it?
that
under
the
statutes
of
alabama,
that
all
officers
where
they
may
hold
office
or
shall
hold
office
or
not,
have
the
right
to
vacate
those
offices
by
resignation,
the
statute
set
forth
in
our
brief.
now,
a
little
difference
for
the
common
law
in
that
that
there
has
to
be
no
acceptance
by
the
appointing
authority.
but
here
in
this
case,
there
wasn't
acceptance.
so,
even
the
alabama
law
and
the
common
law
has
--
has
been
complied
with
by
the
acceptance
of
those
resignations.
and
in
addition
thereto,
the
very
statute
which
permits
their
appointment
and
which
says
that
they
may
hold
office
as
registrars
for
a
period
of
four
years
until
their
successors
are
elected
and
qualified,
substance
of
it.
also
provides
that
they
may
be
removed
at
anytime
for
any
cause
by
the
appointing
authority
which
the
governor,
state
auditor
and
the
commission
of
agriculture
and
industries.
attached
to
these
pleadings
and
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
to
a
motion
which
we
filed
--
our
answer
we
filed
in
response
to
a
motion
to
produce
certain
records
is
in
affidavit
by
each
of
the
respondents,
one,
rogers
and
the
other,
livingston
in
which
it
set
forth
all
the
facts
to
show
that
they
did
resign.
the
resignations
were
in
good
faith.
they
accepted,
by
the
proper
authority
that
a
--
in
addition
had
been
removed
from
office
by
those
appointing
authorities
or
authority
and
had
assumed
other
offices
of
profit.
and
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
state
of
alabama
both,
you
are
prohibited
from
holding
two
offices
of
profit
on
the
state
at
one
in
the
same
time.
now,
there
had
been
some
suggestion
in
the
brief
about
that
the
resignations
were
made
in
bad
faith.
there's
nothing
like
that.
the
whole
argument
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
they
did
not
become
effective
until
the
appointment
of
their
successors
or
--
or
resignation
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
that
brings
a
lot
of
questions,
mr.
justice
douglas.
since
you
asked
me
that
point
blank
i
think
rather
if
you
go
to
assume
that
the
case
is
going
--
become
--
i
mean
the
act,
it
won't
become
law,
we
don't
deal
with
it
on
that
basis.
that
i'd
rather
think
on
the
short
period
of
time
that
i've
had
that
the
--
the
rather
unusual
case
of
rice
versus
sioux
city
cemetery
involving,
i
believe
mr.
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
held
the
opinion
of
the
--of
the
court.
and
now
the
chief
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
black,
mr.
douglas
dissented
but
the
reason
for
that
dissent
is
not
present
here.
and
it
could
be
well
said
that
the
writ
will
be
improvidently
granted
in
this
case
and
you
sent
back
to
the
lower
court
--
not
sent
back
to
the
lower
court
but
the
government
filed
a
new
suit
under
this
new
act
as
it
passed.
we
will
then
have
an
opportunity
to
plead
to
the
constitutionality
of
it.
the
only
difference,
they
may
have
one
ready
now,
as
far
as
i
know,
assuming
the
president
signed
it,
they
could
file
it.
there'll
be
only
a
short
period
of
delay
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
will
preserve
better
everybody's
constitutional
right,
the
state
--
or
to
raise
a
constitutional
question.
so,
during
the
short
period
of
time
that
we
--
or
i
may
say
i
have,
that
my
colleague
may
have
some
other
notions.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
case
which
was
reported
349
u.s.
70
would
have
some
direct
application
and
bearing
on
what
should
be
done
here.
mr.
gordon
madison
(voice
overlap)
and
either
way
it
goes,
we
won't
have
to
respond
(inaudible)
mr.
gordon
madison
if
your
honor
will
say
that
this
nineteenth
amendment
to
1957,
civil
rights
act
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
give
them
a
right
to
proceed
against
the
state,
can
we
raise
any
constitutional
questions
in
that
court.
and
if
you
said
that,
you
have
to
give
me
some
concern.
alright
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
but
regarding
all
those
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
suppose
the
1960
act
is
unconstitutional
as
a
whole.
mr.
gordon
madison
will
there
be
any
question
if
you
do
such
a
thing
as
that
in
this
court
even
if
you
should
hold
that,
that's
proper
way
to
get
rid
of
it.
will
there'd
be
any
question
whatsoever
that
we
have
the
right
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
1960
amendment
in
the
district
court
in
alabama?
mr.
gordon
madison
if
your
honor,
please,
i
don't
speak
for
the
--
i'm
one
of
the
assistants
in
the
attorney
general's
office
and
attorney
general
will
know
that.
mr.
gordon
madison
and
when
it
comes
to
the
matter
of
telling
this
court
what
we're
willing
to
do
or
not
do
to,
you'll
have
to
do
like
you
do
in
so
many
senate
hearings
you
have
to
adjourn
for
while
for
conference
[laughter].
mr.
gordon
madison
i
will
say
through
this
though,
there
is
something
about
this
1960
act
that
somebody
needs
to
go
into
whether
it's
ever
held
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
or
whatnot.
now,
i'm
just
an
ordinary
lawyer
who
deals
--
that
deals
into
constitutional
matters
all
the
time.
i
--
in
my
27
years
of
practice
--
the
general
practice
of
law
before
going
into
the
attorney
general's
office,
i
had
to
take
the
rough-and-tumble
as
it
comes
and
goes.
and
it
just
keeps
in
my
mind,
he
has
master
and
a
servant.
and
the
master
giving
specific
instructions
just
exactly
like
our
board
of
registrars
would
give
the
state
of
alabama,
“in
a
constitutional
argument,
you
must
do
it
this
way,
you
must
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color
or
anything
else.”
and
now,
here
comes
saying
and
says
that
when
the
board
of
registrars
does
that,
it
shall
be
deemed
action
of
the
state.
in
other
words,
the
servant
act
the
way
--
and
beyond
the
scope
of
employment,
scope
of
the
story,
scope
for
everything
else.
and
you
say
that's
deemed
to
be
the
action
of
the
state.
there
are
lots
of
questions
to
be
--
to
be
--
that
brought
these
things
that
needs
some
more
answers
too
and
i
have
mine.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
would
urge
you
not
to
do
so,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
madison
that
i
would
urge
you
to
do
so.
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
his
--
his
proposal
is
made
in
the
light
and
he
must
take
that
in
consideration
in
here
in
what
we
should
do.
that
we
won
this
case
before
the
district
court
and
we
won
it
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
we'd
like
courts
and
stay
in
one.
[laughter]
thank
you.
