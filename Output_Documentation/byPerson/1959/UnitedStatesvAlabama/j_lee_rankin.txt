mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
friday
of
this
last
week,
the
united
states
filed
with
this
court,
a
memorandum
describing
action
by
the
congress
that
we
think
has
a
very
important
bearing
on
this
case
and
removes
some
of
the
problems
otherwise
involved
in
the
case
before
the
court.
i'd
like
very
briefly
to
call
your
attention
to
that
memorandum.
it
refers
to
the
action
of
the
congress
in
passing
the
civil
rights
act
of
1960.
that
act
has
not
yet
been
signed
by
the
president.
the
united
states
believe
that
it
will
be
within
a
short
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
was
up
on
the
fifth
or
i
think
by
the
sixth,
we
will
know
about
the
action
of
the
president.
and
united
states
is
willing
to
rely
upon
the
assumption
that
it
will
be
signed
and
that
the
court
should
examine
the
case
in
the
light
of
that
action.
now,
that
civil
rights
act
of
1960
is
an
amendment
of
the
1957
act
that
was
involved
in
this
proceeding
up
to
the
time
that
we
filed
this
memorandum
and
i
think
that
it
would
govern
the
--
this
proceeding
hereafter.
as
the
court
will
recall,
it
has
held
several
times
that
since
this
in
an
--
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
and
injunctive
relief,
it
is
prospective
in
regard
to
the
effect
of
it.
and
therefore,
there
is
no
problem
about
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
this
case
was
before
the
lower
court.
it
is
a
question
of
what
the
law
is
at
the
time
it
is
brought
back
and
tried
before
that
court.
and
the
court
has
also
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
facts
that
have
--
relating
to
acts
that
have
occurred
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
legislation
does
not
make
it
retroactive.
the
reynolds
case
and
cox
against
hart
are
both
cases
that
bear
upon
that
question.
so
that
the
court
would
properly,
in
examining
this
in
the
trial
of
this
proceeding
before
the
lower
court,
take
into
account
assuming
that
this
act
is
passed,
this
amendment,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1960
would
take
as
an
amendment
of
the
1957
act
and
try
to
determine
what
the
law
is
with
regard
to
the
powers
of
the
united
states
to
bring
such
a
proceeding
in
that
condition.
now,
the
1960
act
is
very
explicit
in
regard
to
the
power
of
the
united
states
attorney
general
to
bring
such
an
action
as
this.
we
have
set
it
out
on
page
2
of
our
memorandum.
“the
act
or
practice
shall
also
be
deemed
that
of
the
state
and
the
state
may
be
joined
as
a
party
defendant.
and
if
prior
to
the
institution
of
such
a
proceeding,
such
official
has
resigned,
or
has
been
--
been
relieved
of
his
office
and
no
successor
has
assumed
such
office,
the
proceeding
may
be
instituted
against
the
state.”
so,
in
this
case,
under
the
facts
here,
there
would
be
two
separate
grounds
for
making
the
state
a
party,
one,
the
absolute
power
to
make
the
state
a
party
and
the
other
the
power
to
make
the
state
a
party
whenever
the
officer
has
resigned.
the
parties,
rogers
and
livingston,
have
both
resigned
in
this
case.
and
so,
it
would
come
under
both
provisions
of
that
portion
of
the
amendment
to
the
statute.
we
do
have
one
further
aspect
of
the
case
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
action
as
to
all
parties.
and
the
united
states
made
the
board
of
registrars
a
party
and
also
rogers
and
livingston,
the
two
individuals,
who
were
registrars
and
had
resigned.
though
that
question,
we
regard
as
a
difficult
question,
we
think
the
united
states
is
right
about
it
and
we've
developed
it
at
length
in
our
original
brief,
but
we
do
not
think
the
court
has
to
reach
that
question.
in
light
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1960,
assuming
it
is
signed
because
we
think
that
the
court
should
assume
and
the
united
states
is
willing
to
assume
that
with
the
state
as
a
party,
thus
a
state
will
comply
with
any
final
order
that
the
court
enters
in
such
a
proceeding
in
regard
to
these
most
important
rights
of
citizens
to
vote.
and
therefore,
we
suggest
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
question
of
the
individuals
in
this
case
and
the
effect
of
their
resignations
and
that
the
court
can
properly
find
that
the
state
under
the
amended
statute,
would
be
a
proper
party
and
that
the
court
at
--
would
at
the
time
the
case
is
returned
to
have
the
power
to
take
jurisdiction
of
a
proceeding
against
the
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
--
that
would
be
--
that's
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
we
also
suggest
that
it
would
be
proper
for
the
court
to
say
at
--
in
this
proceeding
that
the
state
can
be
made
a
party
and
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i'm
trying
to
address
myself
to
the
problem
whether
it
is
proper
at
this
time
for
the
court
without
sending
the
matter
back.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
was
dismissed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
so,
there
is
no
factual
problem
that
the
court
would
have
to
consider
as
the
lower
court
would
have
to
consider
in
regard
to
this
proceeding
in
passing
upon
what
the
civil
rights
act
of
1960
means
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
can
lawfully
be
made
a
party
and
whether
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
such
a
proceeding
against
the
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
the
ground
that
the
1957
act
did
not
permit
the
state
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was.
it
was
dismissed
as
to
all
of
the
defendants.
and
the
united
states
takes
the
position
here
that
if
the
state
is
a
party,
it
will
assume
that
the
state
will
abide
by
any
lawful
decree
of
the
courts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
might
--
i
don't
think
that's
quite
accurate
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
lower
court
seemed
to
have
no
difficulty
with
the
--
it
didn't
reach
any
constitutional
question
but
had
no
difficulty
with
the
power
of
the
congress
to
provide
for
the
state
to
be
made
a
party
if
it
saw
fit.
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
seem
to
me
as
so
clear
in
that
regard
and
at
least
it's
very
clear
that
unless
it
is
explicit,
it
would
not
assume
that
such
an
action
could
be
permitted
and
it
has
some
language
to
the
effect
that
there
might
be
some
doubts
or
at
least
it
wouldn't
be.
[inaudible]
i
think
it's
more
correct
to
say
it
didn't
reach
that
question.
and
so
it
--
you
can't
say
that
they
have
recognized
in
advance
that
there
was
such
a
power
in
the
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
the
united
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
power
of
congress?
i
don't
think
that
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
they
have
path
of
fair
opportunity
to
present
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
i
don't
know
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
united
states
has
taken
the
position
that
this
court
should
not
now
reach
constitutional
questions.
and
we
only
ask
that
the
court
reach
the
question
if
the
statute
is
explicit.
we
point
out
the
legislative
history
as
such
that
there
was
no
issue
about
this
provision.
there
--
the
explanation
was
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
deputy
attorney
general
that
it
was
conceived
that
the
united
states
had
this
power
under
the
1957
act
as
it
was
but
that
it
was
to
make
it
explicit
and
to
have
no
doubt
about
the
matter
that
it
was
now
included
in
the
act.
and
i
don't
think
anybody
will
contend
that
it
isn't
there
but
we
think
the
constitutional
questions
--
questions
are
properly
reserved
to
consideration
when
the
matter
comes
before
the
lower
court
again.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
appreciate
the
court's
saying
explicitly
that
the
statute
does
provide
for
the
state
to
be
made
a
party
and
i
think
that's
proper
since
it
isn't
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
excuse
me,
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seemed
to
me
that
under
subsection
(c)
would
be
the
authority
for
the
bringing
of
any
action
of
any
kind
and
that
is
what
this
proceeding
is.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
then
this
authorizes
the
state
to
be
made
a
party
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
such
a
proceeding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
state
--
it's
under
your
--
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
lower
court
would
examine
the
situation
at
the
time
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
the
united
states
so
contends,
too.
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
sorry,
i
overlooked
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
about
that.
i'm
sorry
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
haven't
been
able
to
canvass
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
but
because
of
the
fact
that
the
signing
hadn't
occurred.
it's
a
little
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
difficult
for
us
to
deal
with
the
problems
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
simply.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
we
think
is
all
that's
left
to
the
case
now.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court,
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
court
should
not
go
into
the
constitutional
questions
here
and
if
those
would
be
handled
in
the
lower
court
and
that
when
they
are
raised
as
though
it
was
ab
initio.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
all
i'd
like
to
say
about
the
fact
of
our
memorandum
being
so
late
is
that
i
think
that
none
of
us
in
the
case
should
be
surprised
at
having
to
deal
with
and
contemplate
the
effect
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1960.
and
as
soon
as
it
was
passed
by
the
congress
and
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
president
would
sign
it.
then
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
the
duty
of
our
office
and
also
counsel
on
the
other
side
should
be
considering
the
matter
to
see
if
they
could
advise
this
court
as
to
how
the
matter
should
be
disposed
of
in
--
in
the
light
of
those
events.
because
it
had
changed
the
situation
so
materially
that
this
court
should
not
have
to
be
burdened
with
an
examination
of
a
situation
that
was
so
materially
changed
that
it
wasn't
the
same.
and
in
light
of
that,
while
we
could
only
file
it
when
we
did
on
friday,
we
were
considering
the
matter
earlier
as
soon
as
the
congress
had
acted
and
i
would
think
counsel
on
the
other
side
should
too.
and
with
the
constitutional
questions
and
all
of
the
rest
of
it
left
to
the
trial,
the
only
thing
we
ask
the
court
to
do
now
is
to
say
what
the
court
has
done
before
in
the
past,
no
factual
problem
about
it
all,
does
this
statute
or
does
it
not
say
that
a
state
can
be
made
a
party
in
such
a
proceeding?
and
we
shouldn't
have
to
face
another
appeal
and
delay
in
regard
to
the
problem
of
that
simplicity.
i
don't
think
that
if
counsel
were
just
given
many
weeks,
he
could
figure
out
many
arguments
as
to
whether
the
statute
does
or
does
not
say
that
very
thing
and
that's
all
we
ask.
