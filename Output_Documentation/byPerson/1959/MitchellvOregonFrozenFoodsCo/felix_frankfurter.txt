when
you
say
--
when
you
say
it's
all
one
operation
to
get
an
exceptional
year
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
normal
year,
what
gaps
in
time
are
there
between
the
beginning
(inaudible)
that
is
--
justice

--
and
the
final
consumer
packaging,
what
gaps
in
time
are
there?
justice

frankfurter
and
we'll
take

take
one
lot
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
seeing
that
through?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
temporarily
and
physically,
that's
one
continuous
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thus
far.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
go
on
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
frozen
--
just
frozen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
freeze
that,
it
--
the
picture
you've
given
me
is
that
of
an
assembly
line
that
(inaudible)
unbroken
without
any
stoppage.
justice

what
--
what
--
how
many
hours
is
--
is
the
process
(voice

--
justice

from
beginning
to
the
final
packaging
so
that
my

can
now
eat
frozen

corn
on
the

--
justice

the
whole
thing.
justice

so
then
what
about
--
and
there's
some
other
things
as
to
what
is
ms.
margolin
said
i
gather
the
following
--
said
i
gathered
she
was
talking
about
(inaudible)
wasn't
she?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
must
be
different
from
what
you've
just
get
this
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
there
is
a
break
due
to
nature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
earlier
vegetables
were
put
in
the
storage
until
you
get
the
(voice

--
justice
felix

you
put
it
that
way.
they're
frozen
whatever
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
frozen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
put
away
in
bins
or
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
to
wait
till
the
corn
comes
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
do
you
sell
any
--
any
frozen
peas
as
such?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
peas
and
the
other
--
and
the
beans
or
whatever,
they
have
to
wait
for
the
belated
corn
and
carrots?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
a
wait
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
those
peas
whatever
vegetables
go
into
this
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
peas
and
the
beans
and
the
lima
beans,
they
wait
for
corn
and
carrots,
but
while
waiting,
they're
not
employed
--
they're
not
utilized
or
packaged
for
any
independent
use,
except
to
wait
for
their
companions
and
vegetables.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
wait
for
the
price
that
you
want,
you
don't
--
your
workers
on
either
the
needs
on
either
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
do
you
with
them,
you
lay
them
off?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
--
the
process
continues,
but
you
withhold
selling,
is
that
it?3
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

that
the
--
all
that
goes
on,
but
you
don't
wait
x
weeks
or
months
in
order
for
repackage.
if
you
do
all
that
--
if
you
wait,
can
you
put
it
on
the
market?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
it
--
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
package
is
weighed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
the
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
didn't
package
till
august
1955,
my
question
a
minute
ago
was
--
what
does
working
for
(inaudible)
that
is
the
packaging.
there's
nothing
to
package
because
you
didn't
pack
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
--
on
something
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
this
question
wouldn't
arrive
if
there
was
no
packaging
done
as
one
stage
and
what
you
contended
as
continuous
process
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
that
stage
wasn't
reached.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
that
time
as
the
--
as
the
season
period-to-period,
you're
now
talking
about,
not
one
continuous
--
not
first
process.
you
claim
exemption
because
it's
within
the

what
is
it
--

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whatever
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(3)
brief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
claim
that's
within

not
that
it's
the
first
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
wouldn't
claim
if
there's
this
long
gap
between
putting
it
in
the
customs
packages,
you
claim
that
comes
under
7
(a)
--
7
(b)
(3),
you
couldn't
claim
that
it
comes
under
(c)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
come
on
the
(c)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
suppose
you
get
your
peas
and
your
beans
or
your
lima
beans
in
and
then
there
is
a
gap
of
two
months
or
three
months
for
one
reason
or
other,
for
the
either
the
corn
or
the
(inaudible)
to
come
in
and
a
further
gap
of
not
meeting
of
an
undesirable
market
and
therefore,
not
packaging.
are
you
claiming
on
the
under
(c)
that
no
matter
how
long
the
interruption
in
these
stages
of
processing
so
long
as
it's
all
the
records
from
beginning
to
end
to
one
half
of
compound
or
combined
products
and
there's
no
intermediate
use
made
of
any
of
the
constituents
that
that's
all
one
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
period
in
between
make
no
difference
except
that
it
all
goes
through
in
one
day
or
two
days,
the
(inaudible)
is
the
fact
that
it's
one
continuous
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
this
the
first
time
this
question
has
arisen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
account
for
that
or
at
least
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
comforts
me
because
this
same
situation
must've
arisen
since
the
beginning
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
except
that
the
exception
--
is
an
exception
--
exception
is
an
exception
or
exemption
and
therefore,
limitation
upon
general
purposes
of
the
act.
they're
not
–
they
don't
run
in
parallel
columns.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
any
comment
to
make
on
this
(inaudible)
narrative
about
the
attitude
of
the
industries
or
the
position
taken
by
the
government
now
sought
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
(inaudible)
certainly
kept
in
the
last
few
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
has
--
he
does
rely
on
his
exemption
under
(c),
has
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
he
--
he
has
that
and
therefore
as
you
are
in
there
has
already
been
a
first
processing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
can't
build
on
there,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
they
usually
make
of
this
partially
processed
commodity
is
for
you
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
margolin,
could
one
make
a
valid
distinction
between
the
processing
described
by
mr.
gallagher
which
is
a
continuous,
uninterrupted
assembly
line,
if
i
may
use
that
to
all
that
analogy
and
situations
where
there
is
a
real
temporal
interruption
of
one
moment
or
a
minute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
gather
the
matter
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
by
way
of
grace
of
the
–
of
the
--
is
that
a
legal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i've
got
a
question
put
here
that
so
long
as
there
is
bulk
–
bulk
of
process
or
bulk
storage,
at
that
point,
he's
rather
–
rather
perfectly
good
physical
lines,
if
all
of
peas
that
have
come
in,
all
the
corn
is
to
be
frozen,
that's
perfectly
physical
--
good
easy
physical
line,
what
you
say
that
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
matter
of
construction,
you
could
think
if
there's
no
such
break
as
there
was
in
1954,
it's
outside
of
your
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
perishability,
but
as
far
as
the
statute
goes,
there's
nothing
in
that
that
to
me
makes
a
difference
between
not
going
into
the
last
state
because
you
haven't
got
any
order
in
going
into
it
because
you
think
it
will
have
orders.
it
--
it
--
a
process
is
continuing
--
is
the
first
process
that
every
state
where
none
of
the
prior
stage
is
itself
a
salable
commodity,
what
is
there
in
the
statute
which
says
you
can't
wait
till
you
have
a
promising
market?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
think
perishable
or
seasonal
refers
to
the
--
to
the
process
to
which
we
subject
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
perishables
that
it
doesn't
relate
to
the
first
processing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
even
so
it
will
bear
on
the
fact
that
it
ceases
to
be,
although
it's
the
continuous
things
from
a
commercial
point
of
view
and
it's
approximately
that
it's
done
in
two
days,
but
it's
not
a
processes,
because
it's
done
in
two
weeks
or
two
months.
