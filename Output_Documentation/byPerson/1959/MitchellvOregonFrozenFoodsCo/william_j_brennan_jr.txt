j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
was
(inaudible)
14
weeks
--
second
14
weeks
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
i
understand
from
work
force
is
defined
from
some
300
to
20,
or
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
we
concerned
here
with
the
exemption
as
to
the
20
only?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
just
--
the
heavier
date
when
this
so-called
post
processing
period
begins
when
they
have
time
now
to
package
for
consumer
use.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
as
the
government's
proof
(inaudible)
i
gather
in
this
court,
which
were
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
all
of
those
presently
exempt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
was
in
1954
that
you
complete
the
last
processing
since
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
in
august.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
the
following
year.
you
mean
that
this
process
of
packaging
generally
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
in
line
with
justice
frankfurter,
a
little
different.
let's
see
if
i
can
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you
have
a
lot
of
pallets
of
corn
in
cold
storage.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
some
of
them
just
sit
there
until
you
get
a
better
market
and
then
when
you
found
a
better
market,
you
then
put
them
off
the
grinds
and
put
them
in
consumer
packages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
of
them
waited
there
for
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
ask
you
this?
are
you
claiming
an
exemption
for
under
the
packaging
done
in
august
1955
or
the
1954
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you
concede
to
the
--
more
than
a
year
ago
before
you
reach
package
--
consumer
packaging,
some
of
these
(inaudible)
you'd
have
no
basis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
the
process
against
ending
with
the
bulk
storage.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
take
your
time
to
find
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
this
--
anything
like
this,
both
in
vegetable
business
or
food
industry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
mean
the
–
dispose
of
vegetables
is
–
is
only
a
matter
(inaudible)
of
10
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
was
whether
in
the
1943
the
processing
of
frozen
vegetables
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
margolin
is
there
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
fact
that
itself
does
first
processing
of
these
things
during
this
period
of
–
work
periods
of
not
more
than
14
work
weeks
in
the
(inaudible)
in
any
calendar
year.
is
it
your
suggestion
there
that
first
processing
might
refer
those
in
the
(inaudible)
up
to
a
year?
