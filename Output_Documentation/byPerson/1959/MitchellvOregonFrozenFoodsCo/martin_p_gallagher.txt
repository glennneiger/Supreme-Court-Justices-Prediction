mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
counsel
has
given
you
a
picture
of
these
two
exemptions
with
which
we
are
concerned
with.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
they
are
two
exemptions,
they
are
not
one
exemption.
we
have
first
in
our
interpretation
the
rather
broad
exemption
under
7
(b)
(3).
our
interpretation
of
that
is
that
as
a
seasonal
one,
exemption
based
upon
seasonality.
it
applies
to
an
industry
or
a
branch
of
an
industry
which
is
found
to
be
found
by
the
administrator
as
seasonal
in
nature.
and
if
the
administrator
does
find
that
an
industry
or
branch
of
an
industry
is
of
a
seasonal
nature,
it's
our
position
that
that
broad
exemption
exempts
all
the
related
activities
that
are
closely
related
to
that
industry
or
branch
of
an
industry
which
is
found
to
be
seasonal.
the
other
exemption
with
which
we
are
concerned
is
a
more
narrower
exemption,
7
(c).
it
is
what
we
call
a
first
processing
exemption
and
it
has
to
do
and
deals
with
directly,
the
particularly
type
of
process
that
the
employer
is
engaged
in
not
generally,
the
type
of
industry
that
he's
engaged
in,
but
particular
process.
therefore,
by
definition,
it
is
a
narrower
exemption.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes
your
honor
as
they
interpret
it
particularly.
they
have
come
on
certainly
a
lot
closer
to
be
in
a
branch
of
an
industry,
if
we
included
all
the
activities
of
first
processing
and
if
by
our
first
processing,
we
would
mean
all
those
steps
that
are
necessary
from
the
reception
of
the
vegetable
to
the
final
package
of
it,
if
that
is
first
processing
(inaudible)
be
a
branch
of
an
industry.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
under
this
act,
all
the
steps
from
the
reception
of
the
corn
to
the
final
packaging
of
the
corn
and
retail
packages,
if
done,
even
in
continuous
process
is
considered
to
be
first
processing.
now,
that's
why
we
raise
this
question
of
two
exemptions
and
that
the
first
processing
as
interpreted
by
the
government
that
is
just
freezing
corn
and
put
it
in
a
64-cubic
foot
bins
and
put
them
in
a
cold
storage,
simply
couldn't
be
a
branch
of
an
industry.
branch
of
an
industry,
we
feel,
should
include
all
the
steps
that
are
necessary
to
have
it
--
give
it
some
economic
justification,
some
purpose,
some
end
result.
and
certainly,
there
would
be
no
end
result
or
nothing
accomplished
simply
by
taking
frozen
corn
and
put
it
in
cold
storage.
therefore,
that
--
that
in
our
opinion
is
not
a
branch
of
an
industry
but
rather
it
is
a
part
of
a
process
of
a
branch
of
an
industry.
now,
so
i
should
like
to
talk
about
exception
7
(c)
that
is
the
narrower
one,
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
that
is
the
first
processing
and
at
this
plant
that
we're
concerned
with,
there
are
two
operating
companies,
both
of
them
are
parties
to
this
litigation.
this
litigation
started
out
by
the
secretary
of
labor
to
restrain
ore-ida
potato
products
company
and
oregon
frozen
food
company,
from
violating
certain
terms
of
the
act
and
asked
for
an
injunctive
relief.
before
and
during
the
trial,
it
became
apparent
and
the
government
proceeded
that
the
--
all
the
activities,
the
ore-ida
potato
products
were
clearly
exempt,
no
question
about
that.
now,
these
two
companies
are
affiliated
companies.
they
operate
side
by
side
from
a
parent
company.
their
freeze
lines
come
down
parallel,
all
the
activities
practically
the
same.
they
have
potatoes
peeled,
sliced
and
blanched
and
then
either
blanched
in
steam
or
oil
and
then
frozen
and
packaged.
in
the
other
lines
we
have
identical
situation.
we
have
the
corn
and
the
carrots
coming
in
it's
washed
and
peeled
and
diced,
steam-blanched
to
kill
the
enzymes,
frozen
and
then
packaged
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
packaged
during
the
harvest
season.
now,
either
the
correct
interpretation
of
this
operation
would
be
that
the
primary
purpose
is
to
get
all
these
corn
in
and
freeze
it
in
storage
--
in
bulk
storage
and
then
package
it
at
leisure,
if
that
was
a
correct
outlet
on
this
operation,
then
perhaps
government's
position
would
be
sound,
but
it's
simply
isn't
that
at
all.
the
primary
purpose
--
the
primary
object
of
this
corn
operation
is
to
get
this
corn
in
and
get
it
into
consumer
sized
package
at
the
very
earliest
date
possible.
if
it
is
a
large
year
with
large
production,
then
it
is
impossible
to
get
it
all
in
consumer
sized
package
during
the
harvest
season.
in
a
given
date
run,
the
lines
operate
all
the
products
are
put
in
to
consumer
sized
package
as
physically
possible.
the
balance
of
it
is
put
in
large
64-foot
--
cubic
foot
containers
in
the
(inaudible)
and
put
in
the
next
room
which
is
the
storage
room,
zero
storage
room.
that
corn
is
brought
out
of
the
storage
as
fast
as
possible
and
put
in
the
consumer
sized
package.
and
if
there's
a
lull
in
the
operation
of
the
day,
if
the
corn
doesn't
come
in
at
night
and
the
night
crew
is
working,
then
these
pallets
are
pulled
out.
it's
all
one
operation.
and
as
soon
as
the
corn
crates
coming
in
at
the
end
of
the
season,
well
that
operation
is
continued.
these
pallets
are
pulled
out
of
storage,
taken
to
the
packaging
line,
then
are
packaged.
now,
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
has
been
put
on
the
reduction
and
force.
well
that's
obvious
and
it's
very
natural.
it
takes
a
great
number
of
people
to
process
this
large
quantity
of
corn.
and
is
shocking
the
--
cutting
the
kernels
from
cob,
or
fixing
the
cobs
and
all
that.
it
takes
a
lot
of
people
to
do
that,
but
it
doesn't
take
many
people
to
run
the
package
line.
there
are
only
two
or
three
package
lines
and
they
accommodate
approximately
20
people
to
the
line,
i
think
the
reduction
is
to
40,
which
would
indicate
two
lines.
and
those
package
machines
operate
directly
from
a
freeze
tunnel
or
from
the
bins.
that's
why
there
is
a
reduction.
there
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
great
significance
and
the
reduction
is
simply
because
it
takes
a
lot
of
people
to
process
corn
where
it
doesn't
recommended
people
to
package
corn.
of
course,
we've
got
to
increase
our
package
and
facilities
and
perhaps
get
all
that
done
in
harvest
season,
but
that's
a
practical
impossibility,
financially
and
every
other
way,
it
be
practically
impossible.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no.
the
ideal
situation
is
to
have
it
all
done
during
harvest
season.
in
1954,
we
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
but
as
the
season
peters
out
of
the
end,
where
there're
more
of
these
bins
pulled
out
and
at
the
end
of
it,
all
these
bins
are
pulled
out
continuously
until
it's
all
packaged.
so
in
answer
to
your
question
categorically,
it
is
one
operation
--
that's
going
right
straight
through
until
it's
all
put
in
consumer
sized
package.
1954
was
a
disastrous
year,
but
1955,
we've
reduced
it
down
to
1000
acres
from
3500
acres
or
1000
acres
and
it
was
the
hope
of
that
year
at
least,
this
testimony
is
taken
july
of
1955,
which
was
preceding
harvest
season
with
the
hope
of
management
there
to
getting
all
done
during
the
harvest
season.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
there
are
no
gaps
in
time
particularly
as
to
the
commodity
goes
right
straight
through
and
into
the
consumers
package.
that
is
just
a
matter
of
an
hour
or
so.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
take
one
lot
goes
in
the
storage
in
(voice
overlap)
the
64-cubic
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
let's
take
a
64-cubic
foot
of
a
corn,
it's
a
cob
corn,
[laughter]
proceeds
in
the
morning,
it's
process
through
the
line,
it's
a
matter
of
a
very
short
time
that
goes
through
the
process
and
probably
an
hour
or
so
two,
three
hours,
that
--
then
into
the
64-cubic
foot
bin
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
still
on
the
cob,
that's
--
i'm
taking
the
cob
as
example,
your
honor.
there
--
the
others
in
kernel
would
follow
the
same
pattern.
a
64-cubic
foot
of
cob
corn
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that
would
include
taking
the
husk
off
and
grading
it,
cutting
the
cob
corn
to
size
through
the
blanching
period,
steam
blanch,
through
the
freeze
tunnels,
and
out
the
other
end
of
the
freeze
tunnel,
in
to
the
64-cubic
foot
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
thus
far.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
then
the
cubic
--
the
--
the
bin
goes
into
full
storage
which
just
across
the
package
room,
it's
all
in
one
building
and
into
the
storage.
now,
from
thereon,
it
will
differ.
let's
take
the
example
of
a
night
crew
having
a
slack
period
of
time.
the
corn
is
not
coming
in
from
the
field.
perhaps
it
rained
that
day
or
something,
so
there's
available
time
(inaudible)
learned
in
harvest
season.
that
a
cubic
foot
or
the
bin
is
brought
back
out
of
full
storage
perhaps
that
evening,
that
night,
or
the
next
day,
whenever
this
factory
comes,
the
corn
from
that
pallet
is
then
dumped
into
the
packaging
line
and
it
comes
down
the
package
line
as
graded
and
sized.
it's
checked
again
for
quality
--
quality
control
goes
through
it
all
and
put
into
consumer
sized
package.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no.
no,
we
leave
it
on
the
cob,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
in
the
--
oh,
yes.
so
we're
excellent,
all
through
the
year,
people
buy
this
cob
corn
in
the
market
and
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
just
frozen
and
they
take
it
home
and
drop
it
in
the
boiling
water
for
two
or
three
minutes
and
it
comes
out,
as
professor
says
“the
closest
to
corn
on
the
cob,”
that
we
pick
off
the
stock
in
our
own
home
garden.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
this
continues
movement,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
from
start
to
finish?
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
i'm
guessing
this
a
little
bit,
but
i
think
a
cob
of
corn
starting
out,
coming
into
the
plant
from
the
farmers,
from
the
time
it
hits
the
plant,
i
suspect
to
matter
three
or
four
hours.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
the
whole
thing.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
we
call
it
a
mixed
vegetable
(inaudible)
i
think
it
has
red
peppers
in
it,
but
its
taste
are
the
same
and
there
again,
the
important
thing
in
the
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
that's
--
that's
somewhat
different
because
of
the
growing
period
and
the
harvesting
time
of
the
various
vegetables.
first,
i
presume
peas
would
be
the
earliest
things
to
be
harvested,
then
green
string
beans
and
lima
beans,
corn
and
then
carrots.
now,
that
is
why
we
can't
mix
these
vegetables
during
the
harvest
season
of
corn,
because
we
don't
have
all
the
ingredients.
we
have
to
bring
these
ingredients
in
as
we
--
as
they
are
frozen.
if
they
are
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
due
to
the
nature
of
their
--
some
delay
in
the
--
in
the
mixed
vegetable
pack.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes,
we
get
--
we
get
our
earlier
vegetables
because
we
can't
grow
them
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
they're
frozen
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
--
at
a
plant
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
and
put
it
in
bins
or
something
and
brought
to
us.
and
we
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
then
we
have
to
wait
until
corn
comes
in.
actually,
we
have
to
wait
if
carrots
to
comes
in,
carrot
is
the
last
one.
but
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
oh
no
[laughter]
no,
we
keep
the
cob
corn
separate.
we'll
--
we
--
we
have
the
kernel
corn
and
that
goes
to
very
much
the
same
process.
now,
on
the
different
--
the
obvious
difference,
after
the
corn
is
husked
and
cut,
then
it
goes
through
the
cutting
machine
and
the
whole
kernel
is
cut
from
the
cob.
and
then
it
goes
down
a
belt
and
is
blanched,
steam-blanched
to
kill
the
enzymes,
then
it
goes
in
the
freeze
tunnel
on
the
continuous
belt.
and
the
belt
is
geared
in
timed
so
that
when
the
corn
comes
on
the
belt
this
end
of
the
tunnel
and
travels
continuously
all
through
and
by
time,
it
reaches
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel,
it's
a
frozen
kernel
corn.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
two
processes.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
some
--
some
we
mix
as
kernel
corn.
we
sell
kernel
whole,
kernel
corn,
just
add
such
frozen.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no,
we
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
up
until
about
october.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
in
time.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
peas
probably
come
off
in
july
--
june
or
july
and
there
would
be
that
period
of
time
for
june
and
july
until
october.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
string
beans
and
lima
beans.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
so
they're
all
joined
in
one
package.
and
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
carrots
are
the
last.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
just
as
soon
as
the
carrots
are
frozen,
they're
diced
carrots,
then
the
mixing
operation
starts
then.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
and
it
takes
about,
i
think
about
two
months
to
complete
this
mixture.
i
think,
pretrial
order
says
in
december
or
january.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
december
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
it's
all
over,
for
the
mixed
vegetables.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
in
1954,
there
was
processing
of
--
of
corn
after
that
and
is
--
has
been
suggested
here
the
--
1954
was
a
disastrous
year
and
there
was
packaging
of
corn.
i
think
most
of
the
next
year
throughout
the
august,
as
far
as
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
price
wise.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
price
of
the
market.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
in
19
--
in
1954,
there
just
wasn't
any
market.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
pack
only
on
firm
orders.
we
cut
our
production
down
to
the
firm
orders.
we
have
30
--
we
had
3500
acres
of
production
in
1954
and
after
that,
we
cut
it
down
to
1000
acres
of
corn.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no.
no,
we
--
we
pack
right
straight
through.
because
now
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes,
that's
correct.
now,
we
have
our
own
storage
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
i
--
i
think
it
is
insofar
that
it
extended
the
time
of
repackaging
more
normal.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
we
--
we
wait
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
we
--
we
don't
wait
to
get
in
the
package.
as
the
testimony
shows
that
the
--
the
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
the
package
is
weighed
after
the
package.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
but
not
the
process.
the
purpose
of
the
process
to
get
it
in
that
consumer
sized
packages
at
the
earliest
possible
time.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
in
the
last
packaging?
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
i
think
that
one
clear
up
in
the
august,
your
honor,
if
i
remember
more
at
the
trial.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
of
1955
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no,
no
the
packaging
out
of
--
of
bulk
storage.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
i
thought
that's
what
you're
really
trying
to
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
that's
--
that's
substantially
correct.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
some
of
them
waited
months.
it
was
a
--
is
the
disastrous
year,
there
was
no
market
and
whether
they're
all
--
all
labor
package
or
not,
i
am
not
clear.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
oh,
they
probably
went
over
and
work
for
our
ore-ida,
that's
the
companion
company
and
these
two
lines
down
here
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
potato
--
potatoes,
but
the
government
says
potato
question
is
--
is
out
of
the
case,
now.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
right.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes,
we
are.
i'm
not
sure
just
weeks
we
claim.
the
record
shows
what
particular
weeks
we
did
claim
these
exempts,
where
the
extent
of
that
time
now,
but
theoretically,
that
would
be
correct.
that
we
would
--
could
claim
of
--
the
reason
for
that
of
course,
is
the
act
says
that
these
weeks
can
be
taken
at
any
time
during
the
calendar
year.
it
doesn't
make
any
limitation
there.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
seven
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
7
(c)
or
7
(b)
(3)
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
we
--
we
claim
that
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
correct
and
we
claim
under
7
(c)
because
it
is
first
processing
and
i've
been
criticized
here
for
the
statements
that
the
government
conceded
this
repackaging
out
of
bins
during
the
harvest
season
as
i
thought
government
told
us
about
was
first
processing,
perhaps
is
wrong.
but
either
it
is
first
processing
or
it's
in
a
normal
situation,
because
you'd
have
this
corn
coming
out
of
bins
and
that
would
not
be
first
processing.
it
has
at
the
same
day,
corn
coming
out
of
the
freeze
lines
and
that
would
be
first
processing.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
right.
our
--
our
year
would
end
our
exemptions
and
then
would
have
14
more
weeks
in
the
next
year.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
also,
--
or
where
there
two
exemptions.
i
mean
we
can
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
we
can
claim
under
7
(c)
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
all
7
(c)
process.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
what
we
claim.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes.
it's
all
one
continues
thing.
there's
no
differentiation
to
be
made
in
the
time
element.
this
act
doesn't
give
any
time
element.
the
regulations
don't
give
any
time
element.
this
is
the
first
time
we
find
this
injection
in
here
of
the
time
element.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
this
precise
question?
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
well,
i
don't
know.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
the
only
explanation
i
have
for
this
coming
up
now
is
within
my
own
recollection
known
familiarity
with
it
would
be
that
first
time
i've
known
that
they've
said
that
this
limitation
of
first
processing
breaks
off
here
at
--
when
we
put
them
in
bins.
and
it's
--
i
think
it's
generally
an
attempt
of
the
wage
and
hour
administration
to
limit
these
exemptions
as
much
as
possible
and
i
think
the
intent
of
the
act
is
to
extend
these
limitations.
i
think
congress
was
--
just
as
answered
in
giving
the
farmers
these
exemptions
and
these
are
important
to
the
farmers
as
it
were
protecting
the
industrial
worker.
now,
on
the
other
side,
there's
a
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
they
don't
run
in
parallel
columns,
but
we
feel
that
congress
was
very
interested
in
those
exemptions
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmer.
there're
some
economic
considerations
in
this
matter
and
that
i
think
that
are
important.
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
we
can
pay
time
and
a
half
over
time
for
this
process
is
--
simply
gets
down
to
the
point
of
--
frozen
food
industry
operates
on
about
two
point
something
percent
profit,
margin
of
profit
and
paying
overtime
increase
the
cost
of
that
would
undoubtedly
wipe
out
any
profit
in
the
industry.
the
frozen
food
industry,
in
this
plant
particularly,
just
cannot
pay
time
and
a
half
for
processed
labor.
now,
we
have
one
or
two
choices
and
we
did
take
one
choice
that
is
the
reduction
of
acreage,
so
that
we
could
come
closer
to
complying
with
this,
using
the
government's
interpretation,
but
there
again,
we
feel
that
that
is
a
detriment
to
the
farmer.
farmers
like
to
produce
this
corn,
it's
a
good
crop
and
we
have
to
pay
time
and
a
half,
if
we
have
to
shorten
our
production
down.
to
meet
that,
that
means
that
there's
probably
2500
acres
of
corn
is
now
produced
in
nassau
county.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
well
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
known
that
the
interpretation
that
the
government
is
now
given
to
first
processing
ends
on
this
bulk
freezing.
bulk
freezing
is
somewhat
new
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no.
it's
--
goes
back
into
the
early
1950s.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
early
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
1951
or
1952.
we
know
over
there
in
1954
because
that's
what
we
were
doing.
now,
we
feel
that
industry's
position
on
that
is
that
they
need
the
exemptions
as
they
have
always
had
them
and
they
ought
not
to
be
cut
down
from
further
exemptions,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
they're
both
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
there
are
identical
items.
one
is
frozen
in
say
for
an
example,
the
(inaudible)
and
shipped
down
to
us.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
i
think
--
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
i
think
he
is
in
the
process
of
processing.
he
does
--
he
does
the
same
thing
we
do.
he
gets
his
fresh
vegetable
in
and
he
is
processing
for
a
consumer
market,
peas
for
an
example.
his
object
is
to
freeze
the
peas,
put
them
in
a
consumer
sized
package
and
he
does
that,
but
in
addition
to
doing
that,
we
are
able
to
buy
in
bulk
from
him
a
ton
or
tons
of
frozen
peas.
and
it's
our
position
that
he
has
not
finished
his
first
processing
at
the
time
that
he
put
those
in
bulk
and
sends
them
to
us,
that
he
is
engaged
in
first
processing
until
he
gets
his
peas
in
a
consumer
sized
package.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
no.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
in
this
particular
lot
that
he
has,
what
we
buy
from
him
he
has,
but
the
balance
of
what
we
buy
from
him
are
probably
just
an
infinitesimal
amount
of
his
production
and
he's
engaged
in
freezing
peas
to
put
in
consumer
sized
package
for
the
retail
market,
but
in
addition
to
that,
he
just
diverts
part
of
his
production
over
to
us.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
well,
undoubtedly,
he
has
both
exemptions.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
well,
basically
we're
engaged
in
the
processing
of
corn
and
carrots
and
the
addition
of
these
other
things
are
somewhat
incidental.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
partially
processed
(voice
overlap)
because
our
interpretation,
it
is
a
process
until
it
--
consumer
sized
package.
that's
the
end
of
the
result.
mr.
martin
p.
gallagher
yes,
that's
right.
