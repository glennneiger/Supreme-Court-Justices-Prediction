ms.
bessie
margolin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
concern
two
related
exemptions
from
the
overtime
requirements
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
as
those
exemptions
apply
to
the
processes
of
frozen
vegetable.
the
first
section,
first
exemption
is
to
that
of
section
7
(c)
which
insofar
is
pertinent
here,
provides
for
an
exemption
of
for
not
more
than
14
work
weeks
in
a
calendar
year,
for
employment
of
employees
in
a
place
where
the
employer
is
engaged
in
the
first
processing
of
or
in
the
canning
or
packing
of
perishable
of
seasonal
fresh
fruits
or
vegetables.
the
other
section
involved
is
the
section
7
(b)
(3)
which
provides
another
overtime
exemption
also
for
not
more
than
14
work
weeks,
but
limited
to
12
hours
a
day
and
56
a
week,
for
any
employee
employed
in
an
industry
found
by
the
administrator
to
be
of
a
seasonal
nature.
now
the
issues
under
both
of
this
--
these
exemptions
turn
on
the
same
language
because
the
administrator
made
his
seasonal
finding
under
section
7
(b)
(3)
in
the
same
language
as
the
first
processing
language
of
section
7
(c)
and
determined
that
the
exemptions
could
be
accumulated.
i'll
say
that
the
issues
turn
on
this
--
the
same
language
at
least
all
the
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
court
below,
the
whole
issue
was
about
the
meaning
of
the
language,
the
first
processing
of
perishable,
of
seasonal
fresh
fruits
or
vegetables
as
used
in
the
statute
in
section
7
(c)
and
the
identical
language
as
used
in
section
7
(b)
(3).
for
--
in
the
briefs
of
respondents
and
of
amicus
curiae,
the
national
association
of
frozen
food
packers
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
a
question
is
raised
as
to
the
validity
of
the
administrator's
seasonal
finding
under
section
7
(b)
(3).
we
have
filed
--
petitioners
filed
a
reply
brief
directed
primarily
to
this
issue
and
if
time
permits,
i
will
come
in
on
it
later,
but
since
the
issues
presented
by
the
--
decided
below
and
tried
below
and
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
related
solely
to
the
meaning
of
this
language,
i'll
address
myself
primarily
to
--
to
that
question,
to
--
to
that
issue.
the
pertinent
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
agreed
to
and
incorporated
by
agreement
in
the
district
court's
pretrial
order
and
by
the
way
were
the
contentions
and
the
issues.
i'm
not
making
too
much
of
the
point
of
that
because
we
--
we
think
that
the
--
the
new
contention
is
--
is
without
merits,
certainly
not
well
taken,
but
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
it
is
--
is
properly
--
whether
it
has
not
been
foreclosed
by
the
stipulation
of
the
parties
at
the
pretrial
order.
the
operations
of
--
of
oregon
are
described
in
these
agreed
facts.
if
the
--
they
have
an
active
season,
they're
engaged
in
--
in
freezing
and
package
--
and
packaging
corn
and
carrots
and
on
mixed
vegetables
--
mixed
frozen
vegetables.
the
active
season
for
corn
is
about
nine
or
10
weeks
from
august
1st
to
august
--
to
october
10th
and
the
active
season
for
carrots
is
from
about
october
15
to
december
1st,
about
six
--
approximately
six
weeks.
the
process
through
which
the
--
the
oregon
purchase
that
--
purchases
the
--
the
crops
during
the
harvested
season
and
from
nearby
--
from
nearby
farm
and
it
has
--
has
to
immediately
process
them
to
stop
the
natural
deterioration
and
--
and
to
put
them
into
preservable
form.
the
process
includes
the
cutting
and
cleaning
and
otherwise
preparing
for
blanching,
a
partial
cooking
process.
and
--
and
this
partial
cooking
process
kills
the
enzymes
which
are
responsible
for
our
organic
growth
and
the
consequent
rapid
deterioration
from
natural
causes.
then
the
--
the
blanched
vegetables
are
put
through
the
freezing
units
and
quick-frozen.
after
they've
been
quick-frozen
in
loose
farm
and
this
is
done
immediately
on
receipt
of
the
--
of
the
vegetable,
some
of
the
vegetables
are
immediately
packaged
in
consumer-sized
containers.
normally,
however,
only
a
small
part
of
the
vegetables
--
the
frozen
vegetables
can
be
so
packed
immediately.
less
than
a
third
of
the
corn
for
example
was
packaged
during
the
active
season
in
1954,
i
believe
it
was.
the
balance
of
the
vegetables
is
packaged
in
large
bulk,
this
is
after
they've
been
quick-frozen,
in
large
bulk
containers
and
placed
in
cold
storage
to
be
repackaged
when
the
rest
season
ends.
this
can
be
and
is
spread
out
over
many
months
and
may
continue
through
the
following
may
even.
in
addition
to
the
--
the
freezing
and
the
bulk
packaging
of
the
corn
and
carrots,
oregon
also
from
december
through
--
i
think
in
december
and
january
for
several
months,
mixed
--
prepares
a
mixed
vegetable,
mixed
frozen
vegetable
from
its
corn
--
its
own
frozen
corn
and
carrots
and
from
--
mixed
with
peas
and
beans
and
lima
beans,
string
beans
and
lima
beans,
which
it
purchases
already
frozen
from
other
processors
in
washington,
california
and
oregon.
the
--
during
the
active
harvesting
season,
oregon
employs
approximately
300
employees
--
production
employees
for
the
processing
of
the
corn
and
reduces
that
number
at
the
end
of
the
season
to
about
20
employees.
for
carrots
during
the
active
season,
about
40
production
employees
are
employed
and
that's
reduced
to
about
20
at
the
end
of
the
active
season.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
seasons
--
i
think
they
do
not
generally
overlap.
i'm
not
--
i
don't
think
that
that
is
clear
on
that.
i
believe
sometimes
these
are
--
i
--
i
assume
are
approximate
dates
that
were
agreed
to.
i
don't
think
any
question
came
up
with
that
overlap.
ms.
bessie
margolin
from
--
the
dates
are
given
and
judging
from
the
dates
it's
about
eight
to
nine
weeks
--
nine
to
10
weeks
for
the
corn
and
about
six
weeks
for
carrots.
there's
some
other
evidence
in
the
record
which
shows
that
the
season
for
carrots
is
much
less,
but
this
must
been
the
agreed
statement,
so
i'm
using
those
facts.
apparently,
it
--
it
varies,
but
it
was
stipulated
that
this
was
approximately
what
the
active
season
was.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
government
conceded
that
during
the
active
--
during
the
active
period,
the
employees
engaged
in
the
freezing,
in
the
--
the
processing
and
the
immediate
packaging
into
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
were
exempt.
engaged
in
--
in
the
immediate
packaging
into
consumer
sized
packages
are
in
the
bulk
containers
were
exempt.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
no,
but
we
--
but
our
contention
is
that
they're
entitled
to
the
exemption
only
for
weeks
when
they're
engaged
in
this
first
processing
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
operation.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
if
we're
concerned,
that's
primarily
our
--
our
concern,
i
presume.
although
it
may
have
kept
some
of
the
--
may
be
a
gradual
laying
off
of
employees
and
maybe
some
of
them
were
kept
on
after
the
--
the
--
it
maybe
some
periods
in
there
where
they
were
using
some
employees
for
non-exempt
activities,
when
they
would
not
be
exempt.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
there
are
--
there
are
--
there
are
some
tables
in
the
record
which
show
--
show
the
weeks
for
which
the
oregon
claimed
the
exemption
and
the
weeks
where
--
which
we
claimed
this
evidence
to
show
which
weeks
we
claim
that
they
weren't
entitled
to
it.
they're
rather
confusing.
i've
tried
to
make
something
of
them
and
i
think
that
it's
rather
confusing
because
it
doesn't
correspond
with
the
--
the
agreement
as
to
what
the
active
season
was.
so
i
think
the
active
season
must
vary
on
these
--
on
these
matters.
and
--
i
have
started
to
make
up
a
record
of
it
and
concluded
that
there
was
some
explanation
as
to
vary
here,
which
wasn't
in
the
record.
ms.
bessie
margolin
we
can
see
that
during
the
active
season
when
the
crops
are
coming
in,
when
there's
a
great
influx
of
crops
and
they
have
to
be
immediately
processed
and
they
--
we
--
and
that
the
freezing
process
is
--
the
freezing
process
and
the
immediate
repackaging,
that
continues
operation
until
there's
a
break
that
that
is
a
–
exempt,
but
when
there's
a
break,
the
subsequent
operations
are
not
that.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
administrator's
interpretation
of
this
language
of
the
exemptions,
his
long
standing
interpretation
has
been
that
this
seasonal
--
that
it
is
a
seasonal
exemption
limited
to
--
to
the
purpose
of
giving
relief,
the
seasonal
commodities
during
the
peak
season
when
prompt
processing
is
essential
for
preservation
of
the
crop
and
when
the
heavy
influx
during
the
short
harvesting
season
can
be
handled
only
by
working
large
quantities
of
labor
for
long
hours
and
that
it
was
not
intended
to
exempt
activities
which
could
be
extended
around
the
year
and
where
there
was
ample
labor
--
year
round
labor
available
to
handle
it.
this
position
as
we'll
later
it
show,
has
been
the
long
standing
interpretation
of
the
administrator
and
has
received
the
approval
of
--
of
congress.
so,
it
--
it
is
also,
we
believe,
are
clearly
in
accord
with
the
original
legislative
purpose
although
we
think
it
is
unnecessary
to
examine
very
far
into
the
original
legislative
purpose
because
it
has
clearly
been
approved
by
the
subsequent
legislative
enactment
of
the
1949
amendments
under
this
court's
decisions
construing
those
amendments.
the
purpose
though,
as
explained
in
both
the
deliberations
in
the
house
and
the
senate
debates,
was
made
plain
that
it
was
to
be
for
these
peak
seasons
to
use
the
language
of
senator
black,
who
was
chairman
of
the
senate
committee,
the
committee
was
concerned
with
the
necessity
of
excluding
purely
seasonal
activities
which
cannot
operate
in
any
other
way
except
by
speeding
up
the
work
at
a
particular
time.
it
was
also
equally
concerned
with
not
extending
the
exemption
to
related
operations
which
didn't
require
of
the
exemption.
we
think
that
the
very
fact
that
there
is
such
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
employees
at
the
close
of
the
active
season
in
this
case,
indicates
that
the
purpose
of
the
exemption
does
not
apply.
there's
other
legislative
history
which
we
go
into
in
our
brief,
particularly
the
--
the
turning
down
of
a
--
an
amendment
which
would
have
broadened
this
exemption,
the
so-called
coffee
amendment
in
the
house,
which
was
rejected
by
--
by
the
house
for
the
narrower
first
processing
language
and
for
this
--
it
was
specifically
pointed
out
that
the
broader
proposal,
coffee
proposal
was
--
was
made
because
the
first
processing
language
might
not
include
all
operations
leading
to
the
final
marketing.
now,
the
trial
court
took
the
position
that
the
--
that
the
only
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
first
processing
of
fresh
seasonal
perishable
or
seasonal
fresh
fruits,
was
the
operations
leading
up
to
a
final
finished
product
for
market.
we
believe
that
the
statute
on
its
face,
that
the
phrasing
of
the
language
of
this
statute,
its
context
in
--
in
relation
to
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
make
it
clear
beyond
doubt
that
the
first
processing
as
used
in
this
section,
did
not
--
did
not
intend
and
certainly
it
was
not
necessarily
must
be
read
as
--
as
going
to
the
processing
of
a
finished
product
for
market.
some
of
the
other
exemptions
specifically
so
provide
and
a
number
of
them
use
the
term,
“processing,”
as
distinguished
from
first
processing.
so
that
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself
show
that
the
first
processing
meant
something
different
from
processing,
distributing
and
marketing.
whether
if
there
were
any
--
if
the
statute
were
less
clear
and
the
original
legislative
purpose
were
less
clear,
we
submit
that
what
has
happened
in
congress
since
then,
has
result
any
doubt
about
it.
congress
was,
at
an
early
date,
made
aware
of
the
administrative
interpretation.
at
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
1949
amendments,
various
proposals
were
made
to
amend
both
of
these
exemptions
and
they
were
--
hearings
were
held
on
them
and
although
congress
did
amend
many
other
sections,
it
didn't
amend
either
one
of
these
exemptions
except
for
--
in
amount
of
detail
not
here
applicable
concerning
buttermilk
and
left
those
sections
intact
and
at
that
time,
congress
was
made
fully
aware
of
just
how
the
administrator
was
interpreting
section
7
(c)
and
how
he
was
applying
section
7
(b)
(3).
and
we
feel
that
apart
from
all
of
the
other
arguments
of
purpose
in
supporting
the
administrator's
position
in
this
case
under
both
exemptions
that
the
congressional
approval
at
that
time
was
sufficient
to
--
to
resolve
any
possible
doubt
of
its
validity.
i
want
to
call
particular
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
--
in
these
various
industry
members
that
appeared
at
that
time
and
at
the
hearings
and
to
consider
when
these
various
proposals
to
amend
sections
--
these
sections
were
--
were
before
congress,
they
appeared
at
the
hearings
to
oppose
any
--
any
changes
in
these
sections.
and
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
national
canners
association
explicitly
advanced
the
argument
that
they
shouldn't
be
amended
because
the
meaning
of
the
exemptions
had
and
i
quote,
“become
crystallized
in
administrative
ruins,
court
decisions
and
industry
understanding.
and
any
unnecessary
changes
may
open
--
reopen
the
entire
problem,
disturb
existing
understanding
of
administrative
interpretation
and
policy
of
enforcement
and
possibly
put
back
the
application
of
existing
rules
at
least
a
decade.”
now,
we
have
cited
that,
we
haven't
quoted
it
in
our
brief,
but
the
national
frozen
food
packers
association
also
filed
a
statement
at
that
time
and
they
stated
that
they
agreed
and
--
and
approved
of
the
statement
of
the
national
canners
association.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
--
that
nobody,
none
of
the
industry
members
wanted
any
changes
in
these
provisions,
because
they
felt
it
would
upset
the
long
standing
administrative
interpretation.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it's
certainly
not
canning.
now
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
packing
is
for
the
--
there's
some
confusion
that
is
in
the
--
in
respondent's
brief.
packing
is
--
has
all
along
been
settled
to
be
packing
and
--
of
the
vegetable
--
fresh
vegetable
in
its
raw
and
natural
state.
ms.
bessie
margolin
perishable,
seasonal
and
perishable
fresh
vegetables,
packing
of
those.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
that's
always
been
interpreted
and
generally
accepted.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
it
was
assumed
and
agreed
that
the
only
question
here
was,
did
these
operations
come
in
the
first
processing
of
--
of
--
do
they
come
within
the
terms
of
the
first
processing
of
perishable
or
seasonal
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
yes.
he's
ruled
that
perishable
--
seasonal
perishable
fresh
vegetables
means
vegetables
in
their
raw
and
natural
state,
that
when
they've
been
frozen,
they've
been
processed
and
what
--
what
--
is
here,
we're
talking
about
the
repackaging
operations
of
the
vegetables
previously
frozen.
ms.
bessie
margolin
he
has
--
he
has
also
specifically
ruled
that
--
that
a
--
a
process
--
packaging
doing
operations,
subsequent
operations
on
vegetables
processed
by
someone
else
at
another
place
of
business,
couldn't
tack
his
operations
onto
the
other
processes,
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
exemptions.
the
--
his
--
his
interpretations
in
this
respect
have
been
--
were
publicly
announced
in
1943.
they
were
included
in
his
regulations
under
section
7
(b)
(3)
and
is
consistently
adhered
to
it
since
then
and
as
i
say
in
1949,
we
submit
that
if
they
secured
the
--
the
gratification
of
congress.
on
the
--
we
also
contend
that
even
if
they
weren't
so
clear
that
the
administrator's
interpretation
is
--
of
the
statutory
language
was
--
were
controlling,
that
at
least
as
to
the
interpretation
of
that
language
in
his
own
determination
under
the
seasonal
exemption
of
7
(b)
(3),
it
would
be
controlling
under
this
court's
decisions.
now,
respondents
in
the
amicus
curiae
don't
take
issue
with
that
argument,
but
they've
come
up
with
--
with
the
new
argument
i
mentioned
before.
they
--
they
now
assert
--
now
contend
that
the
administrator
had
no
authority
under
section
7
(b)
(3)
to
limit
this
seasonal
determination
to
particular
operations
of
an
industry.
we
think
that
--
that
argument
is
clearly
without
merit
of
--
even
if
it
is
properly
raised
at
this
time.
the
industry
--
the
definition
of
--
in
first
place,
the
--
the
section
--
the
exemption
is
clearly
not
self-operating.
it
depends
upon
a
finding
by
the
administrator
that
the
industry
is
of
a
seasonal
nature.
an
industry
is
defined
in
the
act
to
mean
a
branch,
trade,
business,
no
--
no,
trade
business
industry,
any
branch
thereof
and
we
believe
that
this
definition
is
clearly
flexible
enough
to
permit
the
administrator
to
take
out
the
seasonal
parts
of
an
industry
and
find
that
that
is
the
branch
and
that
that
is
seasonal.
and
that
is
what
he
has
done
since
the
beginning
of
the
operation
of
this
act.
he's
done
it
for
years.
those
determinations
have
generally
been
accepted.
they've
been
reported
to
congress
periodically.
in
1949
the
whole
list
of
them
were
reported.
it's
shown
on
their
face
that
most
of
them
were
done
in
terms
of
the
operations
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
particular
determination
in
this
case
was
upon
the
--
the
application
of
the
industry
members.
no
objection
was
made
to
it.
we
went
through
formal
hearings
and
it
was
published
and
objections
were
to
be
made
within
15
days.
no
industry
member
made
any
objection.
and
they
have
been
in
effect
since
--
the
particular
determination
here
has
been
in
effect
since
1940.
the
respondents
rely
on
a
dictum
and
a
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
a
few
years
ago,
which
we
think
the
tenth
circuit
was
led
to
because
of
some
--
of
confusion
and
misapprehension
as
to
just
what
our
function
--
our
regulation,
the
general
regulations
of
the
administrator
play.
if
it
--
if
it
really
meant
to
hold
that
the
administrator
could
not
validly
issue
such
determinations
limited
to
the
operations
that
are
seasonal,
we
submit
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous
and
should
be
overruled
and
was
gone
into
--
to
that
fully
in
our
reply
brief.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
mr.
gallagher's
description
of
the
process
and
how
the
repackaging
takes
place
shows
a
reason
for
the
administrator's
interpretation
and
because
it
--
it
shows
that
there
is
not
at
all
the
same
purpose
for
granting
an
overtime
exemption
for
this
subsequent
repackaging,
that
there
is
for
the
peak
season
processing.
while
fresh
corn
for
example
must
be
processed
within
a
matter
of
hours,
frozen
corn
doesn't
need
to
be
removed
for
months.
and
is
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
regulation
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
was
in
--
published
in
1943.
i
think
it
goes
back
to
before
that
time.
i
--
i
think
it
doesn't
relate
particularly
to
cold
storage.
i
may
have
misled
you
on
that,
but
it
states
his
interpretation
of
where
the
first
processing
ends.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it's
quoted
on
page
22
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
“it's
the
first
processing
applies
an
employee
who
commenced
his
processing
operations
on
a
perishable
commodity
to
which
the
section
7
(c)
for
first
processing
applies.
he
is
considered
engaged
in
the
first
processing
throughout
each
series
of
operations
including
byproduct
operations
which
commence
with
such
initial
processing
of
the
named
commodity
and
have
found
as
a
continuous
series,”
i'm
skipping
a
little,
“of
operations
during
which
the
commodities
remain
perishable.”
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
don't
think
anything
like
this
has
come
up
before
this
in
general
acceptance
of
--
of
the
regulation
and
general
acceptance
of
--
of
the
limitation
to
the
peak
season.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
been
greatly
increasing
in
the
last
decade
and
it's
continuously
increasing
and
that's
why
the
reason
for
the
issue
is
of
such
importance.
it's
not
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
it
was
--
i
think
they
were
some
at
that
day
--
it
wasn't
--
it's
nearly
so
limited
as
it
was
today.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
administrator
has
and
i
assume
that
for
practical
reasons,
so
if
there's
continuous
process
and
uninterrupted,
he
is
not
going
to
try
to
break
off
the
things
that
are
--
are
directly
–
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
required
for
a
--
because
of
the
perishability
factor,
if
they
get
them
immediately
into
consumer
pack
--
packages
in
a
--
in
a
continuous
operation,
he's
not
going
to
cut
them
off
at
the
time
it
gets.
ms.
bessie
margolin
even
though
they
might
not
need
to
do
it
then
for
seasonal
reasons.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
it's
a
practical
interpretation
of
the
--
of
the
act.
i
think
it's
the
--
who
can
say
what
is
the
first
processing
in
the
abstract.
i
mean
this
is
something
that
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
semantics
to
make
a
practical
application
of
--
of
the
purpose
of
the
exemption.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
mr.
gallagher's
position
there.
they
stated
in
the
stipulation
that
they
intended
to
continue
these
proceeds
--
no
repackaging
in
the
future.
and
so
i
assume,
it's
going
to
continue
to
go
on.
well,
i
understood
him
to
say
is
that
sometimes
they
like
to
get
it,
they
can
get
it
packaged
in
consumer
packages.
i
think
he
made
clear
however
that
their
--
their
need
to
get
it
into
consumer
packages
is
not
--
has
not
urgent
by
reason
of
any
seasonal
factors
or
perishability
factors
that
in
a
preservable
state
when
it's
frozen
and
–
and
will
last
for
months.
as
he
have
said
some
of
the
--
some
of
the
corn
didn't
have
to
be
repackaged
of
–
wasn't
repackaged
for
that
nine
months.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
it's
the
--
it's
the
need
to
label
it,
put
the
firm
one
--
to
get
firm
orders.
it's
they're
–
either
their
convenience
or
to
meet
the
orders
of
their
customers
that
they
do
the
repackaging.
that
is
not
dictated
by
the
perishability
or
seasonal
pressures.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
you
can't
wait
until
you
have
a
promising
market.
ms.
bessie
margolin
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that.
there's
something
in
the
statute
that
should
make
it
pretty
clear
that
what
congress
was
interested
in
was
relieving
from
overtime
requirements
because
of
--
of
perishability
and
seasonal
--
natural
seasonal
factors.
that's
--
that's
all
it
was
interested
in.
i
think
that
appears
from
the
language
perishable
or
seasonal
fresh
fruits
of
vegetables.
it
appears
from
the
language
not
more
than
14
work
weeks
and
by
the
way
it
says
not
more
than
notice
that
amicus
curiae
reads
that
as
entitling
them
to
the
14
work
weeks.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
say
these
--
these
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
these
--
these
words
of
the
exemption,
i
think,
are
indicative
of
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
the
legislative
history
shows
that
that
is
what
--
what
congress
had
in
mind.
the
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
there's
a
suggestion
that
you
might
have
several
seasons.
i
think
in
some
–
in
some
commodities,
you
do.
they
come
in
a
different
season,
then
you
can
take
--
you
can
take
it
for
--
for
example
they'll
take
–
they'll
take
it
for
the
first
processing
of
corn
at
one
season,
for
the
first
processing
of
carrots
in
another
season.
i
think
all
i
suggest
is
that
you
--
is
that
you
–
you
–
it
may
have
different
seasons.
