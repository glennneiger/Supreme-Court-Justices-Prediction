mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
richmond
newspaper,
i'm
referring
to
this
case
before
the
court
of
appeals,
said
that
the
question
presented
to
the
court
was,
what
is
a
train?
and
i
think
that
by
--
tersely
sums
up
the
real
question
that
is
here
presented
to
your
honors.
and
in
that
connection,
may
i
say
very
briefly
that
--
and
an
answer
to
the
question
which
was
asked,
that
in
the
burlington
case
the
second
of
the
cases
which
has
been
decided
by
this
court,
the
definition
of
what
governs
is
precisely
stated.
in
the
burlington
case,
this
court
said
the
controlling
test
of
the
statute's
application
lies
in
the
essential
nature
of
the
work
done.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
was
said
and
has
been
affirmed
in
the
northern
pacific
case,
the
last
of
the
cases
which
came
before
this
court
the
essential
nature
of
the
work
done.
now
if
your
honors
please,
it
is
striking
that
the
government
has
not
stressed
the
nature
of
the
work
done.
if
i
may
state
briefly
the
facts,
the
seaboard
air
line
railroad
extends
from
richmond,
virginia
to
florida.
just
south
of
richmond
was
this
spur
track
leaving
the
main
line
at
a
point
known
as
bellwood,
going
to
the
industrial
community
of
hopewell
which
is
at
the
confluence
of
the
james
and
appomattox
rivers.
now
when
a
train
leaves,
and
i
may
say
that
there
is
no
passenger
service
on
that
line
from
bellwood
to
hopewell.
when
a
train
leaves
the
main
line
of
the
seaboard
and
arrives
in
hopewell,
it
goes
to
a
classification
yard
which
your
honor
will
find
in
the
upper
right
hand
corner
of
the
track
which
is
attached
to
our
brief
in
this
matter.
that
is
a
point
where
this
freight
train
coming
into
hopewell
arrives
and
at
that
point,
the
train
stops.
every
train
stops
and
is
broken
up
and
the
cars
are
distributed
to
the
various
tracks
composing
the
yard
for
delivery
to
the
multitude
of
industries
which
are
along
the
track
herein
question.
after
those
cars
are
divided
up,
then
--
and
they
may
be
emptied
or
they
may
be
lowered,
it's
depending
on
the
requirements
of
the
particular
shipper
involved.
then
with
diesel
locomotive
power,
they
move
out
and
may
or
may
not
drop
off
cars
at
least
several,
and
there
are
nine
in
a
distance
of
approximately
two
miles
at
the
several
spur
tracks
breaking
out
of
the
track
to
--
which
is
the
--
where
the
operations
here
involved
took
place.
so,
that
there
are
nine
different
industrial
tracks
along
that
line.
now,
in
this
particular
case
or
in
the
case
of
the
four
movements
here
involved
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
the
classification
yard
is
in
the
upper
right
hand
corner
of
the
track
there,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
yes,
sir.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
they
had
to
follow
the
red
line.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
and
end
up
at
the
continental
can
or
the
atmospheric
nitrogen,
which
is
also
a
division
of
allied
chemical.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
both
at
the
--
as
your
honor
will
see
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
red
line.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
no,
sir.
that's
by
tracks.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
that's
by
tracks.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
no,
sir.
the
yard
limit
is
at
the
left-hand
end
at
the
continental
can
and
the
american
atmospheric
nitrogen.
that's
the
end
of
everything
because
the
river
is
just
the
yard.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
at
the
other
end,
the
yard
limit
extends
on
toward
bellwood
some
little
distance
not
on
this
track
though.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
both
this
entire
area
is
in
the
yard
limit
and
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
sir?
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
two
miles.
approximately
two
miles
is
what
is
involved.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
well,
the
yard
--
the
classification
yard,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
is
up
at
the
right-hand
corner.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
and
then,
the
line
which
goes
on
back
to
the
main
line
is
right
at
the
right-hand
edge.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
and
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
that
--
but
from
there
to
bellwood
is
about
10-12
miles
but
the
actual
yard
limit
is
only
about
a
mile
beyond
the
point
on
the
map.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
so
these
cars
are
brought
in
on
the
track
here
on
the
right-hand
side
into
this
yard
where
the
--
i
mean
the
train
is
brought
in
there
and
it's
broken
up
and
the
cars
are
sorted
and
divided
up
for
the
various
consignees.
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
--
there
are
four
movements
involved.
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
movements,
the
first
one,
there
were
movements
from
the
allied
chemical
back
to
the
yard.
that
is
of
loaded
cars
going
out,
of
26
cars.
the
speed
of
the
train
there
is
10
miles
per
hour.
in
the
second
movement,
there
was
a
--
a
movement
from
the
yard
to
the
american
can
company
in
the
opposite
direction.
and
in
that
particular
instance,
there
were
13
cars
ahead
of
its
engine
and
15
cars
behind
the
engine.
in
the
third
instance,
there
were
29
cars
that
they
started
out
with.
they
picked
up
20
cars
en
route
at
the
norfolk
and
western
interchange
which
is
about
halfway
between
the
so-called
classification
yard
and
the
end
of
the
allied
chemical
plant.
of
those
20
cars
that
they'd
picked
up
there,
there
were
6
loads
and
14
empties
and
the
speed
was
about
six
miles
per
hour.
and
the
fourth
movement
was
from
the
yard
and
to
two
destinations,
the
allied
chemical
and
the
can
company.
eight
cars
moved
ahead
of
the
engine
and
13
behind
at
a
speed
up
from
five
to
seven
miles
per
hour.
now
there
are
the
facts
in
this
highly
industrialized
area
within
the
yard
limits
of
the
city
of
hopewell,
within
the
railroad's
yard
limits
where
these
movements
which
were
made
under
control,
not
of
any
schedule
or
anything
of
that
kind,
but
on
the
--
under
the
control
of
the
agent
at
hopewell,
at
yard
speed
which
is
defined
by
the
company's
rules
as
being
the
capacity
or
ability
to
stop
within
one-half
of
the
visible
distance.
so
the
speed
here
was
always
--
in
no
one
of
these
four
instances
was
in
excess
of
10
miles
per
hour,
i
believe
and
generally
long.
the
government
if
your
honors
please,
has
stated
its
position
in
its
brief
at
page
14
in
the
following
language.
“this
court
laid
down
a
clear-cut
and
precise
construction
of
congress'
use
of
the
term
“train”
as
any
movement
of
an
assembled
unit
of
engine
and
cars
for
an
appreciable
distance
without
coupling
or
uncoupling.”
that's
the
government's
position.
but
that
isn't
what
this
court
said.
this
court
said
that
the
controlling
test
and
that's
what
it
said
in
the
burlington
case
and
again
in
the
subsequent
cases.
the
controlling
test
of
the
statute's
application
lies
in
the
essential
nature
of
the
word
“done.”
now
what
is
that
essential
nature?
it
is
furnishing
shippers
with
the
cars
to
meet
their
needs
on
a
track
within
the
yard
limits
with
nine
spurs
broken
--
breaking
out
from
it,
an
engine
sometimes
in
the
middle.
certainly
that
doesn't
meet
the
common
concept
of
a
train
operating
at
speeds
from
6-10
miles
an
hour.
certain
that
isn't
what
is
considered
the
--
the
train
movement
purely
for
the
purpose
of
picking
up
or
setting
off
in
these
--
for
these
various
industries
their
loads
or
their
empty
cars.
now
we
recognize
if
your
honor
please,
we
recognize
that
transfer
movements
out
or
transfer
trains,
the
statute
is
applicable
to
those.
those
are
cases
where
such
as
the
first
case
that
came
before
this
court,
the
erie
case.
in
that
particular
instance
the
cars,
trains,
transfer
trains
were
being
moved
between
the
jersey
city
yards
and
the
weehawken
yards,
and
the
bergen
yards
located
approximately
two
miles
that
in
each
instance
apart.
and
as
the
court
said,
some
looked
to
the
points
of
the
why.
but
they
were
going
from
one
yard
to
another.
here
the
train
has
reached
its
destination
of
the
classification
yard
in
the
city
of
hopewell.
and
they
are
shifting
these
cars
to
the
individual
industries
to
pick
up
or
unload,
as
the
case
may
be.
and
vice-versa,
they
collect
those
cars
later
and
turn
them
to
the
classification
yards
where
they
are
made
up
into
trains
and
are
carried
to
the
main
line
at
bellwood.
so
we
say
that
the
erie
case
is
not
in
any
way
applicable
here.
nor
is
it
burlington
case
itself
because
in
that
case
they
were
dealing
again
with
transfer
of
trains.
there
the
kansas
city
yards
were
on
both
sides
of
the
missouri
river
and
there
was
a
single-track
bridge
with
the
main
line,
passenger,
and
freight
used
by
three
different
railroads.
and
that
--
it
was
over
that
they
moved.
and
so
again
in
the
jeffersonville
bridge
case,
the
third
case
before
this
honorable
court,
it
went
in
where
they
picked
the
cars
up
whether
at
c&o
and
big
four
railroads
and
their
yard,
and
they
took
it
the
entire
length
of
this
little
bridge
line,
the
jeffersonville
railroad,
and
delivered
the
cars
to
the
illinois
central
at
the
other.
again
that
isn't
the
type
of
movement
we
have
here.
and
in
the
burlington
case
which
was
the
last
case
before
this
court,
the
contention
there
argued
was
that
the
movement
had
to
be
over
a
main
line
in
order
to
be
a
train
movement.
so
now,
if
your
honors
please,
we
recognize
that
that
isn't
necessarily
so
and
that
that
case
settled
that
proposition
that
the
movement
does
not
have
to
be
over
main
line,
but
it
does
have
to
be
wherever
it
may
be,
a
train
movement
because
if
it
isn't
a
train
movement,
the
statute
isn't
applicable.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
certainly,
sir.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
i
do
not
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
i
do
not
recall,
sir,
that
this
specific
question
of
the
requirement
with
regard
to
air
brakes
or
--
and
their
being
used
has
come
up
in
any
fela
case.
of
course,
other
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
that's
--
yes.
there's
been
quite
a
number
of
them
involving,
of
course,
as
your
honor
knows
whether
or
not
the
automatic
couples
work.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
and
whether
the
(inaudible)
were
secure.
but
as
far
as
i
know,
the
mere
failure
to
use
air
brakes
to
couple
air
brakes
in
cases
of
this
character,
as
far
as
i
know,
i
do
not
believe
it
has
appeared
when
any
fela
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
sir?
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
well
if
your
honor
please,
the
fela
requires
that
the
couples
connect
automatically
upon
impact.
if
they
fail
to
do
so,
there's
a
violation
of
the
act
per
se.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
without
regard
to
whether
it's
a
train
or
not.
and
so
also
here,
that
it
is
true
in
regard
to
the
case
of
b.
&
o.
against
jackson
referred
to
by
my
distinguished
opponent.
where
the
question
was
whether
the
gasoline
motor
car
was
a
locomotive.
that
was
the
recent
case
that
was
before
your
honors
where
they
had
the
gasoline
locomotive
car
or
gasoline
work
car
and
the
handcar
that
was
hooked
to
it
by
lincoln
(inaudible).
that
if
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
i
rather
think,
if
your
honor
please.
that
if
it
could
be
shown
that
there
was
a
causal
connection
between
the
failure
to
use
the
air
brakes,
that
it
would
be
applicable.
but
as
appears
here
and
from
the
finding
of
facts
by
the
lower
court,
no
greater
safety
would
result
from
the
use
of
air
brakes
in
this
particular
instance.
the
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
sir?
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
undoubtedly.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
undoubtedly.
you
are
undoubtedly.
but
i
do
think,
so
that
it
does
have
this
bearing
and
that
is
on
the
purpose
of
the
act
which
is
the
safety
of
employees.
now,
if
the
act
is
so
written
that
it
requires
things
to
be
done
by
the
railroad
that
create
greater
havoc
for
the
employees,
then
i
can
put
a
consideration
of
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
if
properly
before
the
court.
if
there's
any
doubt
about
the
applicability
of
the
act,
you
are
absolutely
i
mean
the
entire
court,
sir.
if
the
act
is
so
written
that
it
is
applicable,
then
it
makes
no
difference
about
the
safety
of
employees.
but
i
say
that
it
--
in
my
view
of
the
matter,
that
the
act
is
not
so
written,
that
it
is
an
open
and
shut
case
by
any
manner
or
means
and
that
the
safety
of
the
employee
which
is
the
primary
purpose
of
the
act,
is
to
be
considered.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
if
your
honor
please,
this
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
oh,
excuse
me.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
i
anticipated,
your
honor's
question.
this
spur
track
into
hopewell
from
the
main
line
of
the
seaboard
was
constructed
about
1931
or
1932.
during
that
time
or
from
that
time
until
1951,
the
air
brakes
were
not
used
for
a
period
of
19
or
20
years
without
any
comment,
without
any
criticism
or
complaint
on
the
part
of
anybody.
in
1951,
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
kean,
the
assistant
division
superintendent,
they
were
advised
by
a
letter
from
the
icc
that
they
felt
that
air
brakes
should
be
used
in
that
operation.
in
1956
mr.
merrick,
a
consultant
employed
by
the
seaboard
for
this
purpose
who
had
been
an
inspector
on
exactly
this
type
of
thing
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
32
years,
examined
into
the
operation
at
hopewell
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
air
brakes
were
not
required
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
and
on
the
advice
and
under
the
guidance
of
mr.
merrick
with
32
years
of
experience
as
an
interstate
commerce
commission
inspector
on
this
type
of
work,
the
use
of
the
airb
rakes
was
discontinued.
i
may
say
that
during
the
entire
time
whether
they
were
used
or
not
used,
there
has
been
no
injury
to
an
employee
that
may
be
in
any
way
traceable
nor
to
the
public,
that
may
be
in
any
way
traceable
to
the
use
or
non-use
of
air
brakes
on
this
particular
train
or
in
these
movements.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
if
your
honor
please,
two
inspectors
came
to
hopewell
in
response
to
a
complaint.
the
evidence
shows
that
there
are
an
average
of
10
movements
on
these
tracks.
they
are
of
the
same
general
nature
each
day.
and
they
picked
out
of
the
20
movements,
they
picked
out
these
four
to
be
the
subject
matter
of
the
proceeding
which
was
here
instituted.
the
two
inspectors
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
one
of
them
had
three-and-a
half
years
of
experience
and
the
other
one
i
think
six
years
so,
very
much
less
than
the
retired
inspector
of
32
years
experience.
and,
there
are
evidence--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
that,
sir
i
can
say
--
only
say
that
one
of
their
experts
and
one
that
they
had
used
in
similar
cases
for
a
period
of
32
years
came
to
a
different
conclusion
and
it
may
be
due
to
who
was
paying
the
employee's
salary.
no
worth
the
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
but
there's
been
no
hearing
at
all
before
the
commission.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
the
commission
is
prosecuting
this
--
this
case.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
that
in
other
words,
there's
a
conflict
of
testimony
between
the
--
the
--
the
two
and
if
your
honor
please,
may
i
point
out
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
no,
sir.
this
is
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
for
a
penalty.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
yes,
for
a
penalty.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
the
trier
of
facts
was
the
district
court
and
found--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
it
found
in
our
favor.
and
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
with
the
exception
of
the
800
feet
up
to
the
classification
yard,
the
remaining
balance
of
this
track
is
parallel
by
the
norfolk
and
western's
tracks,
on
which,
the
evidence
shows
exactly
the
same
type
of
work
is
done.
and
these
two
inspectors
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
came
down,
rode
the
trains,
observed
the
norfolk
and
western
didn't
bother
to
look
between
the
cars
to
see
whether
their
trains
were
having
or
using
air
brakes
and
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
that
they
did
not.
and
there
they
are
about
eight-feet
apart
where
the
norfolk
and
western
not
using
air
brakes
and
this
complaint
--
and
doing
exactly
the
same
work
as
the
seaboard
and
this
complaint
was
filed
against
the
seaboard.
of
course
i
realize
that
a
violation
of
the
act
on
the
party
one
or
the
failure
to
prosecute
one
is
no
excuse
for
a
violation
on
the
part
of
the
other.
but
i
do
say
that
those
two
inspectors
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
did
not
proceed
against
the
norfolk
and
western
which
they
observed
and
didn't
take
trouble
to
see
whether
the
air
brakes
were
connected
or
not.
so
that
is
the
situation.
now
in
conclusion,
if
your
honors
please,
what
has
happened
here
is
that
they
are
attempting
to
take
out
of
its
context
what
was
going
on.
it
was
a
switching
movement
and
they
have
lifted
out,
just
as
you
would
a
quotation
from
a
book,
a
small
segment
of
what
was
going
on.
the
prosecution
is
with
respect
to
the
movement
between
the
classification
yard
and
the
industry.
but
actually
the
whole
thing
is
a
part
of
one.
it
is
a
shifting
operation.
it's
a
switching
operation
after
the
train
had
arrived
at
hopewell,
and
it
is
no
longer
a
train
it
has
been
broken
up
and
switched,
and
is
being
switched
and
delivered
to
the
industries
in
question.
so
there,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
lower
court,
chief
judge
sobeloff
dissented
as
to
three
movements
but
concurred
in
the
opinion
of
the
other
two
judges
as
to
one
other.
and
that
was
a
movement
in
which
the
car
--
train
stopped
and
picked
up
20
cars
at
the
norfolk
and
western
interchange.
he
gives
no
reason,
however,
in
his
opinion
why
he
distinguished
the
one
from
the
other
but
that
is
the
difference
in
facts.
so
if
it
please
the
court,
in
conclusion
may
i
say
that
we
fully
concur
in
the
statement
with
which
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
its
opinion.
and
there
they
said
where
congress
has
commanded
the
use
of
train
brakes,
the
courts
cannot
excuse
a
failure
to
use
them
because
of
the
use
of
other
devices
and
measures,
however
effective
in
assuring
safety
there
may
be.
but
if
the
use
of
train
brakes
on
these
movements
is
costly,
delay
of
shipments
and
creates
new
risks
of
injury
without
substantially
contributing
to
the
alleviation
of
existing
way
--
risks,
it
is
a
reminder
that
courts
should
not
extend
the
requirement
beyond
the
intention
of
congress
or
needlessly
chip
away
major
portions
of
the
long
established
exemption
of
switching
operations.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
certainly,
sir.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
in
a
large
measure
the
facts
are
undisputed,
sir.
but
i
do
think
it
is
a
question
of
mixed
law
and
fact
of
what
is
a
train.
here
is
a
questions
that
rather
difficult
to
determine
between
the
two.
i
do
think
it
is
a
--
there
is
a
conflict
of
facts.
the
findings
of
facts
of
the
committee
were
vigorously
opposed
by
the
government
as
not
being
in
accord
with
the
testimony.
so
--
so
there
is
definitely
a
conflict
in
evidence
with
--
in
that
respect.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
i
don't
think
they'd
do,
if
your
honor
please
because
all
of
this
is
entirely
on
the
seaboard's
own
tracks.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
yes.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
yes.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
yes.
i
--
i
know
the
key
is
how
to
make
sure
the
thought
that
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
don't
believe
they
are
helpful
in
this
situation,
sir.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
if
your
honor
please,
the
practical
questions
here
presented
that
the
--
if
this
operation
is
carried
out
with
air
brakes
in
use,
there
will
be
a
great
many
more
movements,
a
great
deal
more
of
time
consumed.
there
will
be
two
additional
engines
in
operation.
it
will
amount
to
$30,000
for
wages
alone
in
this
particular
instance,
and
will
not
result
in
any
greater
safety
to
the
employees
as
was
found
by
the
district
court.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
yes.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
yes,
sir.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
the
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
there
is
no
dispute
at
present
time
as
to
the
facts.
the
facts
are
at
least
the
--
the
basic
facts
are
entirely
agreed
and
i
--
i
--
i'm
sure
there's
no
dispute
at
all.
insofar
as
the
court
made
findings
as
to
dangers
to
the
employees,
it
has
been
our
position
throughout
that
congress,
as
--as
i
tried
to
explain
earlier
has
adopted
a
rule
of
thumb
--
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
that's
right
and
it
doesn't
--
and
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
that
is
right.
mr.
eppa
hunton,
iv
well
i
don't
--
there
are
no
facts
in
dispute.
we
are
all
in
agreement
and
--
about
everything
that
actually
took
place.
the
only
question
is
whether
it's
a
matter
of
law,
they
were
required
to
accept
their
brakes
under
these
circumstances.
i
may
say
that
as
far
as
the
application
of
the
law
is
concerned,
the
law
provides
that
when
a
railroad
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
in
a
situation
like
this,
it
makes
no
difference
about
the
particular
movement
whether
that
--
do
you
consider
to
--
though
i
have
no
doubt
these
were
in
interstate
commerce.
but
there's
no
question
of
--
and
there's
no
dispute
between
us
as
to
the
application
of
the
act
to
this
movement,
if
it
be
a
train,
if
these
be
trains.
