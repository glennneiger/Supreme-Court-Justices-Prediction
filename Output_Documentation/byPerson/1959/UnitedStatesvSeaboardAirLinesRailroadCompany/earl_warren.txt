mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
it
wasn't
in
that
process
that
you
had
as
many
as
29
cars?
chief
justice
earl
warren
going
--
to
onto
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
individual
consignees.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
if
--
if
the
safety
appliance
act
was
--
was
for
the
sole
purpose
of
protecting
the
employees
of
the
railroad
or
does
it
have
to
do
also
with
safety
for
the
public
generally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
wouldn't
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
fact
--
wouldn't
the
fact
that
in
this
case
you
have
several
grade
crossings,
several
crossings
of
--
of
railroads,
also
be
an
important
factor
in
determining
whether
--
whether
the
air
brakes
were
--
were
used
or
not
in
this
operation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
we
have
one
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
we
have
one
that
did
bear
on
this
somewhat?
wasn't
it
that
oil
tank
--
the
oil
tank
that
the
--
not
the
employees
of
the
railroad
but
an
outsider
was
--
was
filling
the
oil
--
the
oil
tank
in
the--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
was
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
those
runways
to
be
--
that
weren't
--
weren't
on
the
car.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
several
years
ago,
we
had
one
of
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
hunton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
limit
of
the
yard
is
two
miles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
how
far
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
length
of
your
yard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
--
but
what
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
--
what
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
i
thought
you
said
that
it
was
longer
than
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
up
in
the
right-hand
corner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
tracks
three
and
five,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
how
--
how
long?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
about
three
miles
long.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
how
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
commission
did
not
agree
though,
with
its
--
with
its
former
employee,
did
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
commission
with
its
expertise
came
to
the
conclusion,
though,
that
the
act
did
apply,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
what
did
the
--
what
did
the
commission
ultimately
determine
in
this
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
commission
is
prosecuting
this
matter
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
the
net
result
is
that
they
don't
agree
with
their
former
employee
whom
you
rely
on.
