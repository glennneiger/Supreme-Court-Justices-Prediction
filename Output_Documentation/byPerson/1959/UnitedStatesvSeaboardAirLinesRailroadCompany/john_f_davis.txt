mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
simple
question
on
the
application
of
the
safety
appliance
law.
specifically,
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
air
brake
requirements
of
that
law
were
required
to
be
followed
by
the
seaboard
air
line
railroad,
in
its
performance
of
certain
terminal
operations
in
hopewell,
virginia.
it
--
it
had
an
--
on
four
occasions,
moved
strings
of
cars,
about
25
cars
each,
a
distance
of
about
two
miles
in
making
deliveries
to
or
making
pickups
from
industrial
establishments
in
hopewell.
and
in
all
of
these
occasions
the
air
brakes
were
not
connected.
the
united
states
brought
suit
for
civil
penalties
$100
for
each
violation,
$400
is
the
total.
now,
although
this
penalty
is
small,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
of
tremendous
importance
because
it
affects
the
--
the
lives
and
the
--
the
safety
of
thousands
of
trainmen.
when
president
harrison
asked
for
this
legislation
back
in
1890,
he
submitted
figures
to
the
congress
that
showed
that
during
the
year
preceding
his
message,
2450
trainmen
had
been
killed
in
operating
accidents
and
22,390
has
been
injured
and
of
these,
in
two
years,
over
1000
had
been
injured
in
falls
from
the
tops
of
cars,
which
were
due,
in
part,
to
the
use
handbrakes.
one
of
the
senators,
in
discussing
the
legislation,
estimated
that
in
the
course
of
eight
years,
the
equivalent
of
the
entire
railroad
operating
force
would
be
killed
or
injured.
and
so
the
congress
passed
the
legislation.
and
i
looked
at
the
reports
on
safety
for
the
year
1958
and
the
total
of
persons
killed
in
operating
accidents,
trainmen
was
down
to
154.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
but
this
statute,
i'm
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
suggesting
is
--
is
important
and
has
had
an
important
effect.
we
--
we
can't
tell
how
much.
the
general
question
before
the
court
is
whether
this
legislation
is
going
to
be
enforced
regarding
to
its
explicit
terms
of
whether
the
railroad
shall
be
allowed
to
return
in
part,
at
least,
to
the
situation
that
they
were
in
before
the
legislation
was
passed.
now,
the
terms
of
the
law
which
are
before
us,
the
questions
of
law
are
not
difficult.
the
statute
is
set
forth
--
the
statutes
are
set
forth
on
pages
2
and
3
of
my
brief.
the
first
provision,
section
1
of
the
act,
was
passed
in
1893
and
it
provides
for
power
brakes
to
be
placed
on
cars,
but
it
provides
no
specific
measure
of
how
--
how
many.
it
says
instead
that
they
shall
be
sufficient
so
that
the
engineer
may
control
the
speed
of
the
train.
this
proved
to
be
not
sufficiently
definite
and
in
1903,
it
was
amended
and
the
provision
which
is
still
in
effect
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
our
brief.
and
in
this
law,
they
provided
that
at
least
50%
of
the
--
of
the
cars
should
be
provided
with
air
brakes,
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
might
after
hearing,
increase
though
not
decrease,
this
number.
and
that
all
other
power
brake
cars,
that
were
part
of
the
train,
should
be
connected.
so
that
they
were
required
to
carry
only
50%
with
power
brakes,
but
if
added
cars
did
have
power
brakes,
they
too
must
be
connected.
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
implemented
that
by
its
regulations
which
appears
at
the
top
of
page
4,
providing
that
not
less
than
85%
of
the
cars
must
have
their
power
brakes
connected.
in
--
in
actual
operating
effect,
all
the
brakes
--
all
the
cars
must
be
connected
because
in
effect,
all
cars
do
have
power
brakes
and
since
you
are
required
to
connect
any
that
do
have
them,
in
effect,
all
of
the
brakes
--
all
of
the
cars
must
be
connected
at
this
time.
now,
the
facts
are
these.
the
seaboard
air
line
railroad
moved
four
strings
of
cars
over
its
yard
tracks
within
the
city
of
hopewell,
virginia.
in
each
case,
there
were
--
the
strings
of
cars
consisted
of
between
23
and
29
cars
and
they
were
moved
a
distance
of
two
miles
in
three
of
the
cases
and
one
mile
in
the
fourth
without
leaving
off
or
picking
up
any
extra
cars.
these
were
--
in
other
words,
uninterrupted
movements
of
one
or
two
miles.
now,
these
movements
occurred
after
freight
trains,
only
freight
operations
are
involved.
freight
trains
had
been
brought
in
on
a
spur
track
from
the
main
line
to
hopewell,
which
was
at
the
end
of
this
--
of
this
side
track.
there
the
cars
were
--
the
trains
were
dismantled,
taken
apart
in
the
classification
yard
and
reassembled
into
smaller
groups
for
delivery
to
the
ultimate
consignees.
and,
our
case
deals
with
this
movement
of
the
delivery
of
23-29
cars
to
the
consignees
are
picking
up
these
cars
from
the
factories
and
bringing
them
back
to
the
classification
yard
where
they
would
again
be
combined
into
--
into
larger
trains.
these
operations
were--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
individual
consignees.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
certainly
it
can't
be
the
number
of
cars
by
itself
because
there'd
be
many
trains
or
there'd
be
one
--
one
car
or
two
cars
which
would
be
trains
and
everyone
would
recognize
as
trains.
many
passenger
trains
will
have
only
one
or
two
cars
so
that
certainly
it
wouldn't
require
a
--
a
long
string
of
cars
in
order
to
be
a
train.
and
the
length
of
the
--
the
distance
--
the
distance
of
the
move,
too,
is
not
and
i
don't
believe
it
has
to
be
as
long
as
--
as
two
miles
because
well,
one
of
the
four
cases
which
have
been
before
this
court
is
the
louisville
&
jeffersonville
bridge
company.
in
there
was
a
distance
--
was
three-quarters
of
a
mile
and
that
was
of
--
of
uninterrupted
movement.
i
think
that
you
just
have
to
look
at
the
combination
of
what
the
railroad
is
actually
doing
to
see
whether
it
is
dismantling
trains,
putting
them
together,
spotting
cars
on
them,
or
whether
it's
making
a
movement
from
one
place
to
another,
a
transporting
movement
of
the
string
of
cars.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
lower
court
in
this
case
--
well,
the
lower
court
in
this
case,
said
that
it
was
switching.
that
they
--
they
in
--
in
effect,
they
say
we'll
have
to
find
out
whether
or
not
this
is
switching
and
they
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
there
were
crews
--
switching
crews
and
that
it
was
within
the
yard,
limited
speed,
and
those
--
and
those
factors.
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
--
the
court
was
correct
in
trying
to
assess
the
dangers
which
were
involved
in
the
particular
movement.
i
think
that
congress,
when
it
adopted
this
law
said
that
all
trains
--
all
trains
should
have
the
air
brakes
connected
and
from
then
on,
the
purpose
of
the
court
with
the
--
the
objects
of
the
court
should
not
have
been
to
reappraise
whether
this
was
necessary
for
safety,
but
they
should
have
been
merely
do
--
approaching
whether
or
not
we
do
have
enough
cars
to
be
a
train.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
it
were
a
pure
factual
question
of
whether
if
they
--
whether
this
was
a
train,
i
--
i
doubt
that
you
would
have
taken
the
case.
i
mean
if
it
was
just
a
question
of
individual
--
of
the
application
to
an
individual
movement
if
there'd
been
no
--
what
we
conceive
to
be
a
misconstruction
of
the
statute,
a
misapplication
of
the
statute,
unless
that
occurs
so
frequently
that
we
have
to
be
up
here
because
the
statute
is
whittled
away
so
there's
nothing
left
of
it.
but
obviously,
each
individual
case
can't
be
passed
upon
by
this
court.
we
think
that
unless
congress
--
unless
there's
some
compelling
reason
to
believe
that
congress
used
this
term
“train”
in
a
technical
sense
to
exclude
some
operations,
that
it
must
be
taken
in
this
ordinary
common
sense
meaning.
now
i
must
tell
the
court
that
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
there
was
a
technical
definition
of
“train”
which
had
been
adopted
by
what
was
then
called
the
american
railway
association,
the
predecessor
of
the
american
association
of
railroads
today.
and
they
had
a
--
a
rule
--
standard
operating
rules
for
railroads
and
in
this
they
did
define
a
“train.”
and
they
defined
it
much
as
it's
defined
in
the
american
association
of
railroad
rules
today.
it's
quoted
on
page
18
of
my
brother's
brief
as
“a
locomotive
or
more
than
locomotive
couple,
with
or
without
cars
and
showing
markers.”
this
definition
is
just
not
helpful
in
connection
with
the
use
of
air
brakes.
it
had
its
purpose
but
it
--
whether
or
not
a
train
shows
markers
has
got
no
significance
whatsoever
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
markers
are
the
devices
which
are
carried
on
the
rear
of
the
last
car
of
a
train.
in
the
day
time,
they
are
flags.
at
night
time,
they're
lights.
and
the
reason
that
this
definition
occurs
in
these
rules
is
that
in
the
old
days
of
single-track
operation,
on
a
train
--
trains
would
separate.
the
--
the
linkage
was
and
it
stood
between
cars,
and
trains
would
sometimes
separate
in
operation
and
the
engineer
wouldn't
know
it.
then
if
a
train
is
--
passes
another
train
on
a
--
on
a
switch
and
the
switchman
looks
up
and
see
as
it
go
by
and
turns
the
waiting
train
into
the
track,
he
wants
to
be
sure
that
all
of
the
train
has
gone
by.
otherwise,
there'll
be
a
collision
down
the
road.
so
he
knows
that
the
train
has
gone
by
when
he
sees
the
markers
on
the
rear
platform
of
the
--
of
last
car.
and
this
is
--
this
is
a
very
realistic
operating
practice
and
something
that's
--
that
s
got
nothing
to
do
whether
you
ought
to
connect
the
air
brakes.
in
fact
under
that
particular
rule,
a
single
--
a
single
locomotive
without
any
cars
at
all
or
two
locomotives
coupled
are
--
are
considered
a
“train.”
and
obviously
the
air
brake
regulation
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
actually,
this
rule
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
the
early
cases,
the
erie
case
and
the
chicago,
burlington
&
quincy
case
which
were
the
first
two
to
come
up
under
this
provision
of
the
law.
and,
these
--
this
provision
and
it's
right
with
its
definition
of
“train”
was
called
to
the
court's
attention
and
the
court
brushed
it
aside
by
saying
that
it
had
no
relation
to
the
--
to
the
--
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
this
particular
statute.
and
so
we
suggest
to
the
court
that,
as
the
--
as
the
court
has
said
in
one
of
the
other
cases,
a
string
of
cars,
26
cars,
drawn
by
a
locomotive
is
in
common
sense
a
train
and
this
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
defining
when
the
brakes
should
be
coupled.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
erie
case.
not
a
definition
but
they--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
they
refer
the
--
the
erie
case
and
the
chicago,
burlington
case.
in
fact
all
of
these
four
cases
refer
to
switching
operations
as
example.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
justice
clark
in
the
louisville
&
jeffersonville
bridge
company
case,
which
is
the
third
of
the
four
cases,
refers
to
switching
operations
as
a
movement
of
one
or
a
few
cars
for
a
short
distance.
and
i
think
he
also
adds,
“in
the
process
of
sorting,
selecting,
or
classifying
those
cars.”
i
think
if
i
had
to
pick
a
definition,
i
think
i'd
pick
--
i
think
justice
clark's
one
in
louisville
&
jeffersonville
bridge
company
case
is
--
is
as
definite
as
anything
there
is
in
any
of
the
four
cases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
--
this
area
is
without
question
within
the
marks
which
the
seaboard
has
set
up
as
defining
their
railroad
yard.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
about
halfway
along
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
tracks,
there's
an
interchange.
and
all
of
these
move
under
yard
rules.
the
--
the
purpose
of
yard
limits
as
set
up
by
the
railroads
where
they
define
the
operating
rules
for
--
for
movements
there.
and
when
they're
within
the
yard,
they
move
under
directions
of
the
yardmaster
rather
than
on
schedules
or
under
train
orders
and
they
move
under
certain
conditions.
and
these
trains
without
question,
under
the
railroad
rules,
were
moving
under
those
conditions.
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we
believe
not.
we
believe
that
what
is
involved
here
is
a
transfer
movement
of
strings
of
cars
from
the
classification
yards
to
the
industries
where
they
are
to
be
delivered.
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
i
depart
a
little
from
those
cases
and
suggest
in
questioning
whether
or
not
the
term
of
whether
this
switching
is
really
controlling.
i
think
that
in
those
cases
what
they
are
saying
is
that
in
most
switching
operations,
trains
are
not
involved.
but
i
don't
think
we
really
get
very
far
in
trying
to
define
the
word
“switching”
as
such.
i
think
that
we
might
as
well
go
back
to
the
act
and
see
whether
or
not
this
appears
to
be
a
train.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
it's
very
important
for
the
safety
of
the
public
generally.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
has
a
very
great
impact
on
the
safety.
but
i
think
that
congress
intended
to
adopt
the
rule
of
thumb
in
this
case.
i
think
that
they
wanted
to
take
away
from
the
railroads
--
from
the
icc
any
question
of
evaluating
the
safety
of
individual
movements.
and
they
wanted
to
say
that
we're
going
to
set
down
a
rule
that
you
connect
up
your
air
brakes
on
all
trains.
now,
there's
no
question
that
the
public
wondering
would
some
of
these
streets
remain
highways
in
there
and
there's
no
question
that
the
ability
of
a
train
to
stop
quickly
is
important
to
the
safety
of
--
of
people
crossing.
in
fact
most
of
the
accidents
today,
most
of
the
fatalities
on
railroad
operations
as
your
honors
know
it
in
intersection
--
highway
grade
crossings
rather
than
in
tracks.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
there's
a
specific
provision
for
--
in
the
act
for
the
protection
of
employees
where
there
is
a
violation
of
the
--
of
the
statute
which
means
--
and
he
wouldn't
get
the
protection
of
that
provision
of
the
act,
if
they
weren't
provided.
the
last
case
that
came
before
your
honors
was
a
case
of
an
--
a
compensation.
it
was
the
baltimore
and
ohio
against
jackson
case
where
the
question
was
--
it
was
a
five-to-four
decision
as
i
remember
it,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
motorcar
pulling
a
handcar
was
a
locomotive
and
whether
it
had
to
have
certain
of
the
appliances
which
the
safety
appliance
law
requires
for
locomotives.
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
this
motorcar
was
a
locomotive.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
wasn't
a
decision
--
yes,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
john
f.
davis
what?
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
wasn't
the
safety
appliance
law,
i
think.
mr.
john
f.
davis
although
i
may
be
wrong.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh
well,
they
--
they
do.
the
safety
appliance
laws
--
you're
quite
right
there,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
safety
appliance
laws
require
runways
to
be
of
a
certain
width
and
they
are
inspected
to
be
sure
that
no
boards
were
fallen
off
and
--
and
it
was
very
likely.
i
and
don't
--
i'm
not
aware
of
the
particular
case,
but
it
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
covered
by
the
safety
appliance
laws.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i've
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
