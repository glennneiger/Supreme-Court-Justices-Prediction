no,
to
one
consignee.
these
were
uninterrupted
movements
without
leaving
off
or
picking
up
any
cars.
they
were
movements
in
--
they
had
four
operations
involved,
involving
--
the
first
one
was
26
cars,
the
second
28,
and
the
third
29,
and
the
fourth
was
23.
and
in
each
case,
each
of
the
three
--
of
three
cases,
they
moved
the
entire
three
miles
without
stopping,
well,
they
may've,
i
don't
know
what
they
--
without
stopping
but
without
leaving
off
or
picking
up
any
cars.
in
the
other
case,
there
was
a
movement
of
only
one
mile.
they
did
pick
up
some
cars
of
an
interchange
with
the
norfolk
and
western
after
they'd
proceeded
one
mile,
so
that
we
have
three
movements
of
two
miles
and
one
movement
of
one
mile.
these
--
these
operations
were
performed
by
trained
--
by
yard
crews
as
the
movements
were
ordered
and
directed
by
the
yard
manager.
the
motor
power
was
a
diesel
switching
engine
and
the
speed
at
which
the
train
moved
was
--
was
limited.
their
rules
were
that
they
must
be
able
to
stop
within
half
the
distance
that
they
could
see,
half
the
line
of
vision.
the
operations
carried
them
across
numerous
streets
and
roads,
at
grade
crossing
and
there
were
two
or
three
intersections
with
norfolk
and
western
spur
tracks.
the
violation
which
was
involved
was
that
they
didn't
connect
up
the
air
hoses
on
these
cars.
so
far
as
i
know,
all
of
the
cars
were
equipped
with
power
brakes
but
the
--
for
operating
reasons,
the
train
--
the
--
the
crews
determined
to
rely
just
on
the
train
brake
and
not
connect
up
the
compressed
air
with
the
brakes
on
the
individual
cars.
this
is
not
because
it
couldn't
be
done
because
the
seaboard
had
used
air
brakes
on
these
very
runs
from
the
year
1951
until
the
year
1956.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
were
no
violations
during
that
time.
in
this
operation
they
did
connect
their
--
their
air
brakes.
but
in
1956,
because
of
these
operating
reasons,
it
caused
delay.
it
took
20
minutes
to
connect
up
the
brakes
at
the
beginning,
20
minutes
to
disconnect
them.
took
additional
men.
for
operating
reasons,
they
decided
they
would
stop,
and
they
stopped
in
january
of
1956
and
made
as
in
--
from
then
on
it
was
their
--
their
policy
not
to
connect
these
brakes.
so
compared
to
its
neighbor
the
icc
the
inspectors
observed
these
actual
operations.
they
filed
the
complaint
and
a
civil
suit
followed.
the
court
below,
which
is
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
found
that
the
movements
in
question
were
not
covered
by
the
safety
appliance
act
on
the
ground
that
these
strings
of
cars
which
i
have
described
were
not
“trains”
within
the
meaning
of
--
of
the
act.
and
that's
the
only
question
of
interpretation
we
have
really
in
this
case
is
whether
when
they
used
the
term
“train”
in
the
act,
they
mean
to
refer
to
this
type
of
operation.
now
the
third
circuit
reached
the
conclusion
that
they
were
not
trains
because
it
said
that
these
were
“switching
operations.”
and
again
that's
in
quotes,
“switching
operations”.
now
the
act
doesn't
--
doesn't
contain
any
specific
exception
for
switching
operations.
but
in
the
early
cases
that
came
before
this
court,
the
court
accepted
an
interpretation
which
the
icc
and
the
department
of
justice
suggested
that
there
were
certain
limited
movements
by
a
locomotive,
one
or
two
cars
involved
in
taking
apart
or
putting
together
trains
where
they
were
continually
dropping
off
and
picking
up
trains
which
--
cars
which
were
not
trains.
they
--
we
suggested
they
were
switching
operations.
and
in
the
early
cases
before
this
court
which
dealt
with
transfer
operations
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
safety
appliance
laws
did
apply,
they
recognized
that
that
would
be
an
exception
for
such
--
for
such
a
--
an
operation.
it
wasn't
because
it
was
switching,
however.
there
wasn't
any
--
there
isn't
any
exception
for
switching.
it
was
because
they
felt
in
that
type
of
operation,
a
train
“was
not
involved.”
now
we
think
it's
decisive
in
this
case
that
there
were
mass
movements
of
such
relatively
large
numbers
of
cars
over
such
a
relatively
large
distance
and
without
interruption.
this
it
seems
to
us,
is
not
switching,
is
--
and
is
a
--
it
is
a
use
of
a
--
of
a
train
in
the
--
in
the
normally
accepted
use
of
the
term
“train.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
davis,
is
there
any
case
aside
from
northern
pacific
too,
that
purports
that
it's
by
this
court
that
purports
to
contain
any
definition
of
the
exempted
activity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
we
see
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
i
noticed
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
northern
pacific
said,
“a
moving
locomotive
with
cars
attached
is
without
the
provisions
of
the
act
only
when
it
is
not
a
train,
as
where
the
operation
is
that
of
switching,
classifying,
and
assembling
cars
within
railroad
yards
for
the
purpose
of
making
up
trains.
is
there
any
other
definition?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
area
that
we're
concerned
with
here
in
your
view
within
railroad
yards?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
the
lead
track
extending
from
a
classification
yard
into
an
industrial
section
and
from
which
spurs
turn
the
--
to
the
side
to
the
industries,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and,
it
also
extends
to
the
norfolk
and
western
interchange.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
were
these
operations
essential
to
the
switching,
classifying,
and
assembling
then
within
those
railroad
yards
of
these
cars?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
say
is
that
really
found
open
here,
what
was
the
rule
against
this
(inaudible)
are
we
not
--
the
important
to
act
as
it
should
be?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
hunton,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
have
not
used
a
contract
(inaudible)
and,
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
observed
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
but
is
not
our
question
one
of
law,
namely,
whether
did
this
operation
constitute
a
train?
i'm
trying
to
get
information
upon
whether
we
have
a
disputed
question
of
fact
here
resolved
by
a
trial
court
or
whether
we
have
a
question
of
law.
