mr.
charles
j.
merriam
your
honor,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
which
had
issued
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
petitioner
directing
him
to
send
back
to
dallas,
texas
a
patent
infringement
case
which
had
been
begun
there
and
which
had
been
transferred
to
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
eastern
division.
the
facts
on
the
case
are
simple.
the
plaintiffs
were
all
illinois
residents
or
corporations
having
their
place
of
business
in
and
around
chicago.
the
two
defendants,
mr.
howell
and
lifetime
metal
buildings,
were
both
residents
of
texas
and
have
their
only
place
of
business
in
and
around
dallas.
after
the
case
had
been
begun
in
1957
in
dallas,
the
defendants
moved
to
transfer
the
case
to
illinois
because
of
the
pendency
of
another
patent,
in
fact,
two
other
patent
infringement
cases
which
had
been
pending
in
illinois
for
some
time
and
in
which
a
great
deal
of
pretrial
discovery
had
been
had.
the
court
granted
the
motion
to
transfer.
the
plaintiffs
in
texas
took
--
asked
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
the
district
judge
in
dallas.
they
were
--
that
writ
was
denied
in
ex
parte
blaski
in
245
f.2d
737.
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
asked
from
this
court
and
denied
and
then
the
case
was
sent
to
illinois
whereupon
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
there
was
no
--
there's
no
point
of
discretion
in
this
case.
it's
entirely
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
and
it
was
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit.
when
the
case
was
sent
to
illinois
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
when
the
case
came
back
to
--
came
to
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
it
was
assigned
to
judge
hoffman
and
the
plaintiffs
moved
to
send
it
back
to
texas
on
the
ground
that
the
illinois
court
had
no
power
to
receive
it
or
the
texas
court
had
no
power
to
send
it.
and
judge
hoffman,
the
petitioner
denied
the
motion
whereupon
a
writ
of
mandamus
was
sought
from
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
was
denied
on
july
1,
1958,
whereupon
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
and
granted
on
october
16th,
1958
without
reargument.
a
petition
was
then
filed
by
judge
hoffman
asking
that
the
court
reconsider
the
whole
matter
en
banc
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
decision,
in
this
case,
was
contrary
to
two
other
cases
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
contrary
to
the
decisions
in
four
other
circuits
including
the
blaski
case
to
which
i
have
just
referred.
that
petition
--
that
request
for
a
rehearing
was
denied
for
the
two.
incidentally,
the
reversal
of
the
mandamus
was
two
to
one.
this
was
for
the
two
and
the
petition
to
this
court
was
properly
taken
and
granted.
and
there
are,
as
your
honors
know,
two
other
cases
which
follow
this,
one
from
the
seventh
circuit
and
one
from
the
fifth
on
the
same
point
which
involves
the
construction
of
section
1404
(a)
of
the
title
28
judicial
code
which
reads,
“for
the
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses
in
the
interest
of
justice,
a
district
court
may
transfer
any
civil
action
to
any
other
district
or
division
where
it
might
have
been
brought.”
and
those
last
six
words
are
the
ones
which
have
caused
all
of
the
controversy
here.
because
of
the
time
the
case
was
transferred
from
texas
to
illinois,
there
was
no
indication
that
except
for
the
waiver
which
was
made
in
the
motion
to
transfer
that
either
mr.
howell
or
lifetime
metal
buildings
could
have
been
served
in
illinois.
they
have
not
--
they
have
no
place
of
business
there,
they
were
not
resident
there
and
they
had
not
committed
an
act
of
infringement
there.
no
charge,
there
was
of
no
point
that
i
make
to
the
contrary.
the
question
therefore
was,
did
the
waiver
which
was
accompanied
--
which
accompanied
the
motion
to
transfer,
as
a
matter
of
law
bring
the
situation
within
the
1404
(a).
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
--
i
think
that
you're
right,
your
honor.
i
have
raised
only
the
question
of
power
here
and
not
discretion.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
as
i
said
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
the
--
we
considered
that,
your
honor.
and
in
my
brief
in
the
district
court,
i
said
something
which
judge
hoffman
refused
to
let
me
say
here
in
my
brief,
anywhere
on
the
ground
that
was
frivolous
but
i'll
say
anyway.
now,
in
--
in
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
judge
hoffman
said
it
was
not
sufficiently
dignified
but
if
we
had
not
come
here
before
this
court,
this
case
would
have
orbited
between
dallas
and
chicago
because
the
fifth
circuit
was
under
a
final
order
to
send
it
to
illinois
and
the
clerk
in
chicago
was
under
a
final
order
to
send
it
to
dallas
and
it
would
have
presented
a
situation
which
to
us
seems
not
in
good
consonance
with
the
way
courts
had
to
act
and
therefore,
up
to
be
adjudicated
in
some
way.
and
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
haven't
thought
so.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
think
it
raises
a
question
of
administration
but
if
jurisdiction
is
involved,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
avoided.
at
least
we
have
not
gone
off
on
that
--
that
angle
for
the
reason
i've
given.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no
sir,
i
hope
not.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i'm
not
sure
it
is,
your
honor.
it's
found
in
the
opinions
of
the
court
that
there
was
a
waiver.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
motion
for
transfer
is
not
in
the
printed
record.
i
think
the
motion
is
here
in
it's
entirely,
but
i
don't
have
that
probably.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
believe
so.
there
is
no
question
about
the
waiver
having
been
made.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
wasn't
there
at
the
time
but
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
made
at
the
same
time
and
as
a
part,
whether
it
was
actually
passed
as
a
separate
document
or
was
in
the
motion,
i
don't
know.
i
make
--
i
don't
--
i
make
no
point
of
any
difference
and
i
don't
think
my
opponents
have.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
--
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
history
of
section
1404
(a)
goes
back
of
course
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
gulf
oil
against
gilbert
in
330
u.s.
501,
which
was
a
five
to
four
decision
on
the
matter
forum
non
conveniens
after
which
the
congress
passed
this
section
in
1948.
and
promptly
there
was
a
flood
of
litigation
concerning
its
meaning.
there
were
first
two
cases
in
this
court,
the
ex
parte
collet
in
337
u.s.
55
and
the
u.s.
against
national
city
lines
in
337
u.s.
78,
both
of
which
involved
this
section
but
not
this
point
and
that
is
there
was
a
good
deal
of
controversy
as
to
whether
the
section
would
extend
to
federal
employer's
liability
act
or
to
the
antitrust
legislation.
the
--
this
court
decided
it
did
but
there
was
a
dissent
in
which
it
was
indicated
that
the
proper
party
to
decide
that
should
have
been
congress.
and
a
flood
of
litigation
--
a
flood
of
legislation
was
introduced
into
congress
at
that
time
or
within
a
short
time
after
it
to
change
the
ruling
of
the
collet
and
national
city
lines
cases
by
limiting
the
action
of
1404
(a)
to
those
cases
which
did
not
have
special
jurisdict
--
special
venue
statutes.
that
--
there
were
13
such
acts
and
that
was
considered
by
the
judicial
conference
for
some
time
and
i'll
come
back
to
that
later
but
--
but
i'll
merely
say
at
this
time
that
it
was
decided
not
to
amend
the
act.
in
the
meantime,
there
was
a
series
of
cases
which
begun
in
the
courts
of
appeals
with
paramount
pictures
versus
rodney
in
186
f.2d
111
in
the
third
circuit,
dealing
with
it
precisely
the
point
which
we
have
before
us
here.
that
is
the
matter
of
whether
a
case
might
have
been
brought
in
a
jurisdiction
where
venue
depended
upon
a
waiver
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
suit.
that
case
was
heard
by
all
seven
justices
--
judges
in
the
third
circuit,
and
by
a
five
to
two
decision,
it
was
held
that
the
words
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”
would
cover
such
a
situation.
and
accordingly,
that
case
was
transferred
to
a
jurisdiction
where
some
but
not
all
of
the
defendants
could
have
been
served
without
the
waiver.
after
that
case,
the
matter
came
up
next
in
the
second
circuit
in
anthony
against
kaufman
of
193
f.2d
and
there,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
reached
the
same
decision
but
then
came
up
in
the
first
circuit
and
in
in
re
josephson
in
218
f.2d
174.
it
came
up
next
again
in
the
second
circuit
in
two
cases
in
torres
against
walsh
in
221
federal
second
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
matter
was
directly
involved,
the
court
indicated,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
that
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
he
talked
about
that
a
great
deal
but
i
--
my
understanding
of
the
case
is
and
that
decided,
although
there's
a
little
question
on
my
mind
whether
he
--
he
regarded
venue
waivers
is
necessary.
the
--
the
case
could
in
my
estimation
be
read
to
cover
--
transfer
even
without
the
waiver.
however,
it
certainly
goes
into
the
waiver
matter.
in
the
torres
against
walsh
case,
the
second
circuit
came
back
to
the
situation
in
order
to
transfer
to
puerto
rico
upon
agreement
of
the
defendant
ship
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
company.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that
has
not
been
raised,
your
honor.
there
seems
to
be
a
great
deal
of
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
think
it
probably
is
implicitly
involved
in
all
of
them
i
think
that
the
parties
in
all
of
the
cases
felt
for
the
--
would
--
that's
not
the
way
to
decide
it
but
they
would
prefer
to
have
it
adjudicated
finally
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
the
difference
of
opinion.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
there
certainly
is.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
it's
very
important.
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
he's
not
been
adequately
brief
in
any
of
the
cases
which
of
course
does
not
mean
that
you
can't
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
reach
out
and
--
and
take
it
but
nobody
has
raised
that
point.and
i
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
agree
and
we
felt
that
there
was
enough
to
be
said
in
favor
of
the
mandamus
is
a
matter
of
right
in
a
non-jurisdiction
case
that
we
did
not
raise
that
point.
now,
after
the
torres
against
walsh
case,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
had
two
cases.
one
of
which
as
we
pointed
and
the
other
of
which
is
not
but
which
is
referred
to
in
the
record
at
page
46,
and
again,
at
page
49
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
--
of
judge
finnegan
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
merely
referred
briefly
to
that
case
because
it
happens
to
involve
the
same
plaintiffs
who
are
in
this
case.
they
had
gone
to
milwaukee
and
started
a
case
there
on
these
patents
that
are
involved
here
and
judge
tehan
transfered
back
to
chicago
and
a
petition
for
mandamus
was
filed
with
the
seventh
circuit
seeking
to
stop
that
transfer
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
and
the
court
acting
through,
i
believe
judge
schnackenberg
and
judge
lemley,
only
two
judges
denied
the
--
denied
the
writ
and
that
case
is
still
pending
in
illinois.
now,
the
fact
that
it's
still
pending
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
it
came
up
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
torres
against
walsh,
i
believe
was
in
the
second
circuit
your
honor.
that's
221
f.2d
319.
i'll
check
the
circuit
but
i'm
quite
sure
that's
where
it
was.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
they
haven't
--
had
enough
experience
to
answer
your
honor
but
they
have
followed
in
that
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
in
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
in
the
seventh
circuit,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
such
uniformity
judging
by
the
experience
here
as
i
will
point
out
in
just
a
minute
because
in
the
general
casualty
against
grubb,
judge
grubb
had
transferred
to
oklahoma,
he
sued
against
to
wisconsin
residents
and
mandamus
was
sought
against
him
and
denied
--
certiorari
was
taken
to
this
court
and
denied.
my
opponent
say
that
in
that
case,
the
suit
could
have
been
brought
in
oklahoma
against
one
of
the
defendants.
i
find
nothing
in
the
record
which
--
which
so
indicate
nor
do
i
see
any
reason
why
it
would
it
make
a
difference
that
it
could.
the
suit
was
one
for
the
construction
of
a
contract
of
automobile
insurance,
and
while
the
accident
had
occurred
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
i
see
no
reason
to
assume
and
the
court
certainly
didn't
go
on
this
ground
that
that
case
could
have
been
brought
in
oklahoma
against
two
wisconsin
residents
via
washington
insurance
company.
now,
with
those
two
cases
in
the
books,
ours
came
up
and
they
say
that
it
first
decided
one
way
and
then
two
to
one
the
other
way
and
then
four
to
two
petition
en
banc
was
denied.
it's
petitioners
position
here
that
it
isn't
necessary
for
us
or
don't
hesitate
if
asked
to
say
exactly
what
language
in
the
statute
should
be
construed
and
exactly
what
way
to
serve
the
purpose
of
the
first,
second,
third,
and
fifth
circuits
and
of
the
two
earlier
decisions
of
the
seventh
circuit.
and
--
but
that
the
statute
was
passed
as
a
remedial
statute
due
to
the
situation
that
resulted
from
gulf
oil
against
gilbert
and
--
but
under
that
situation,
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
is
that
a
statute
which
is
intended
as
a
remedy
should
be
broadly
construed.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
act
is
ambiguous
as
to
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
there
is
no
statement
as
to
whether
that
means
where
it
might
then
had
been
brought
that
is
in
on
the
day
that
the
suit
was
filed
or
whether
it
is
of
some
subsequent
time
such
as
the
time
the
motion
to
transfer
is
granted.
if
you
go
to
the
forum
non
conveniens
cases
as
mr.
butler
has
in
the
case
which
follows
and
he
has
gone
into
it
at
great
length
and
i
don't
want
to
deprive
him
of
the
opportunity
of
presenting
that
in
the
first
distance,
in
the
forum
non
conveniens
cases,
it
never
was
a
rule
that
the
two
forums
which
were
prerequisite
to
the
doctrine
--
to
the
doctrine
had
to
be
available
on
the
day
the
suit
was
filed
and
that
seems
to
make
good
sense
because
i
would
think
it
was
rather
rare.
but
in
the
first
place,
justice
would
seem
to
indicate
otherwise
but
i
think
it's
quite
rare
that
a
plaintiff
who
is
filing
a
suit
can
be
absolutely
certain
on
the
day
he
files
it
whether
he's
going
to
get
good
service
on
the
defendant
or
not.
and
if
we
start
using
his
subjective
test
to
that
nature,
what
happens,
do
we
investigate
to
see
whether
at
the
day
that
suit
was
started
in
texas,
the
texas
people
happened
to
be
in
europe
and
therefore,
it
couldn't
have
been
served
there
until
a
month
later?
i
don't
think
we
do.
and
therefore
i
think
that
an
--
an
objective
point
of
view
which
promotes
justice
is
to
be
preferred.
but
the
cases
which
have
found
in
the
way
which
petitioner
found
have
not
gone
in
to
detail
reasoning
for
the
--
for
basis
for
their
findings
that
begs
in
the
rodney
case
made
a
great
many
suggestions
as
to
how
the
statute
might
be
interpreted,
how
the
language
which
is
--
might
be
brought
and
that
could
be
brought,
indicates
permission,
brings
out
the
dramatical
basis
for
where
it
might
have
been
brought
as
to
whether
it
means
in
the
day
the
complaint
was
filed
or
sometime
later
but
he
does
not
try
to
pin
it
down
anymore
than
we
are
trying
to
pin
it
down
here
as
to
the
exact
words
which
should
be
used.
as
matter
of
fact,
the
only
court
that
i
know
of
that
has
held
the
act
unambiguous
is
the
seventh
circuit,
two
to
one
in
this
case.
it
says
it's
clear
and
ambiguous
--
unambiguous.
whereas
i
don't
think
any
other
court
in
considering
it
has
so
stated
and
certainly
the
law
review
articles
which
were
cited
in
the
cases
and
a
great
--
there
are
great
many
of
them
say
anything
to
the
contrary.
they
all
said
it's
ambiguous
and
some
of
them
were
quite
vehement
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
there
are
two
--
two
seventh
circuit
cases,
they're
both
here.
those
are
the
only
two
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeal
that
have
gone
that
way
and
mr.
justice
whittaker
had
a
case
in
--
in
--
while
he
was
on
the
district
court
in
which
he
went
the
other
way
but
in
which
he
finally
decided
that
there
was
venue
in
the
others'
denial
on
that
case
and
transferred
it.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that's
not
what
my
opponent
say
but
it
--
the
--
there
is
the
case
the
shapiro
against
bonanza
hotel
in
the
ninth
circuit.
in
that
case
however,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
waiver
of
venue,
the
plaintiff
moved
to
transfer
from
the
nevada
to
california
where
there
was
no
jurisdiction
of
the
defendants
or
venue
either.
and
the
court
properly
in
that
case
said
that
it
should
not
transfer
to
california.
i
don't
think
that
is
in
any
sense
contrary
because
there
was
no
question
of
waiver
of
venue
there.
the
--
they
also
cite
the
milburn
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
--
the
milburn
case
against
knight
which
is
in
185
f.2d
was
again
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
sought
to
transfer
and
there
was
no
waiver.
and
while
his
language
might
be
interpreted
one
way
as
against
the
other,
the
decision
in
the
case
is
not
in
anyway
contrary
to
this
and
of
course
it
was
ahead
of
the
kaufman
case
and
the
torres
against
walsh.
now,
they
also
cite
as
contrary
to
the
situation
the
--
this
early
case
in
the
--
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
cited
by
in
the
blaski
opinion
in
that
court
which
appears
at
page
9
of
the
transcript.
and
on
page
11,
the
court
discusses
blackmar
against
guerre
in
--
which
was
in
190
f.2d
427
as
being
contrary.
and
that
case
did
deny
the
transfer
but
it
did
not
go
into
the
matter
of
waiver
of
venue
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
says
this
did
not
go
into
it
and
this
is
not
contrary
authority.
so
i
don't
--
i
don't
consider
as
contrary
authority
and
--
i
know
no
--
no
circuit
court
as
such
except
these
two
decisions
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
have
taken
the
other
position.
now,
in
the
meantime
while
the
--
the
chronology
here
is
somewhat
interesting
because
the
rodney
case
was
decided
in
january
of
1951,
january
5th
i
believe.
the
kaufman
case
was
paneled,
what
was
decided
later
in
that
same
year,
the
josephson
case
in
1954,
the
torres
case
in
1955
and
the
blaski
case
i
forget
whether
it's
1957
or
1958
on
the
fifth
circuit.
during
that
time,
the
--
a
member
of
the
judicial
code
and
particularly
the
venue
sections,
were
under
consideration
by
the
judicial
conference
and
that
is
summarized
and
referred
to
in
our
brief.
in
the
report
number
1706
of
the
house
of
representatives,
85th
congress
second
session
and
the
document
is
extremely
interesting
and
showing
just
what
it
was
it
was
before
the
judicial
conference,
the
length
of
time
it
was
before
the
judicial
conference
and
what
they
decided.
now,
the
--
on
page
13
of
the
document,
there's
a
footnote
and
i'll
read
the
footnote,
it's
not
long
and
it's
not
quoted
in
my
brief.
“chief
judge
parker
presented
a
resolution
of
the
judicial
council
of
the
fourth
circuit
with
respect
to
legislating,
proposing
to
establish
restrictions
upon
the
existing
statutory
power
of
the
district
courts
in
the
transfer
of
civil
cases.
it
was
the
opinion
of
judge
parker
as
well
as
that
of
the
judicial
counsel
of
the
fourth
circuit,
but
because
of
the
numerous
legislative
proposal
which
had
--
recently
been
introduced
affecting
the
venue
on
jurisdiction
of
the
courts,
it
was
advisable
to
have
a
committee
of
the
conference
created
for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
entire
question
of
venue
and
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
and
that
was
done
and
the
report
was
submitted
not
only
to
all
of
the
circuits
but
there
was
--
it's
pointed
out
on
page
27
of
the
report.
a
special
conference
was
held
in
each
of
the
first,
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth,
seventh,
eight
and
tenth
circuits
concerning
the
entire
subject
matter.
and
the
conclusion
was
that
no
change
of
the
nature
proposed
to
be
made
in
section
1404
of
the
judicial
code
be
made.
now,
it's
true,
i
don't
want
to
mislead
anybody
that
the
change
that
was
under
some
--
the
specific
change
under
consideration
was
that,
to
cut
down
the
right
to
transfer
in
all
cases
where
the
venue
was
controlled
by
a
separate
act.
however,
the
court
could
not
have
during
that
time
with
members
from
the
various
circuits
which
had
--
were
passing
on
this
subject
has
failed
to
consider
also
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
act
should
be
narrowed
or
to
eliminate
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
and
i
cited
in
my
brief
the
nlrb
versus
gullett
gin
company
case,
340
u.s.
361
in
this
case
--
court,
state
of
missouri
against
ross
at
299
u.s.
72
and
75.
both
of
which
held
that
where
an
act
in
one
case,
as
the
bankruptcy
act
has
been
on
--
analogous
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
act
had
been
under
consideration
by
congress
during
a
period
while
decisions
were
being
handed
down
adopting
a
particular
construction
that
the
court
should
not
go
counter
to
that
construction
which
the
courts
have
found
during
that
period
of
time.
now,
actually,
the
document
from
which
i
read
a
moment
ago,
the
report
of
the
85th
congress
was
not
put
out
until
1957
i
believe.
and
during
all
of
that
time,
the
cases
had
been
unanimous
toward
the
position
which
petitioner
seeks
here.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
think
that
if
the
position
of
the
respondents
here
were
taken,
the
transfer
of
litigation
to
a
place
where
it
is
more
convenient
would
be
greatly
cut
down
to
the
detriment
of
justice
because
--
take
a
diversity
case
where
there
are
--
not
corporations
but
individuals.
the
only
place
that
an
act
can
be
brought
--
action
can
be
brought
in
the
federal
court
of
either
the
residence
of
the
plaintiff
or
the
residence
of
the
defendant.
if
it's
brought
on
one
of
those
places
--
well,
if
it's
brought
on
that
residence
of
the
defendant,
he
has
many
place
to
transfer
it
to.
unless
he
happens
to
be
spending
most
of
his
time
in
the
residence
of
the
plaintiff
and
that's
highly
unlikely.
therefore,
there's
practically
no
chance
to
transfer
a
diversity
case.
i
think
the
thing
--
the
same
thing
is
true
of
--
of
a
patent
infringement
case.
now,
there
is
one
way
around
this
which
is
not
been
pointed
out
on
the
briefs,
it
might
change
this
point
and
that
is
that
it
could
be
decided
that
if
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
could
be
maintained
on
the
same
issues
in
the
place
to
which
transfer
was
made
that
then
it
could
have
been
brought
there
on
the
day
the
action
was
filed,
and
therefore,
the
action
not
in
posture
which
it
was
presented
but
on
the
same
issues.
now,
that
might
be
a
distinction
that
would
overcome
a
part
of
my
problem.
but
we
have
here
a
case
in
which
it
is
conceded
at
least
to
the
purposes
of
this
court
by
our
opponents
that
justice
is
--
the
interest
of
justice
is
required,
requires
that
this
case
be
transferred
to
illinois.
now,
why
should
that
interest
of
justice
be
denied
upon
a
technicality?
the
court
below
said
that
if
our
position
was
followed
that
a
case
could
be
transferred
to
any
court
in
the
united
states.
and
it
seems
to
petitioner
that
that
ignores
the
fact
that
the
act
says
that
it
can
only
be
transferred
where
the
interest
of
the
parties,
the
convenience
of
the
parties
or
the
witnesses
or
the
interest
of
justice
require.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
now
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
your
honor.
but
i'm
saying
even
if
the
--
our
court
of
appeals
says
if
you
take
the
position
that
where
it
might
have
been
brought
can
be
--
that
goes
that
can
be
after
the
filing
of
the
complain,
then
you
have
no
one,
somewhere
you
may
go.
and
i'm
only
addressing
my
comments
to
the
fact
where
--
where
it
might
have
been
brought
includes
a
waiver
of
venue.
under
that
condition,
there
is
still
the
limitation
in
the
statute
about
convenience
as
a
--
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses
and
the
interest
of
justice.
and
i
don't
know
any
reason
to
suppose
and
it
has
been
said
by
this
court
that
it
will
not
be
supposed
that
a
district
judge
will
go
contrary
to
his
duty
and
to
the
interest
of
justice.
certainly,
i
don't
think
legislation
can
be
interpreted
on
the
basis
of
the
district
courts
and
not
going
to
do
the
duty.
and
therefore
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that
is
correct.
well,
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
there
are
some
other
ones
that
we're
not
concerned
with
but
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
to
some
specialist.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
my
a
--
i
do,
but
i
say
that
that
language
should
be
interpreted
not
as
of
the
day
the
complaint
was
filed.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
and
just
a
point
in
time
that
has
no
significance,
but
to
the
time
that
the
actual
order
of
transfer
is
carried
out.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
if
the
--
yes
--
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
the
interest
of
justice
so
require
but
only
then.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
and
the
court
finds
if
that's
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
--
yes,
well,
yes.
i
think
so.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes
sir,
and
that's
done
regularly
in
the
forum
non
conveniens
cases
with
which
mr.
butler
has
gathered
a
great
number.
and
particularly,
the
one
in
vargas
against
bull
steamship
company
in
131
a.2d
at
39
i
believe
the
page
where
the
superior
court
of
new
jersey
and
by
judge
(inaudible),
and
a
very
careful
review
of
the
entire
subject
matter
applied
the
rule
that
forum
non
conveniens
would
not
be
dismissed
unless
the
defendant
consented
to
be
sued
in
the
convenient
forum
where
he
could
not
and
ordinarily
been
sued.
now,
that
case
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
it
was
a
jones
act
case
and
with
--
and
it
was
--
and
certiorari
was
brought
to
this
court
and
denied.
the
opinion
is
not
by
a
united
states
court
but
it's
a
very
thoroughly
considered
opinion
following
the
rodney
and
the
kaufman
and
the
torres
against
walsh
decisions
in
saying
that
the
rule
must
be
the
same
in
forum
non
conveniens
cases.
and
there
are
quite
a
numbers
of
cases
including
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
where
the
same
rule
has
been
submitted
and
in
fact
in
the
--
in
this
court
--
well,
i
can
find
it
here.
in
canada
malting
versus
paterson,
285
u.s.
413,
this
isn't
in
my
brief
but
it's
in
one
of
the
other
briefs.
two
--
two
ships
collided
in
the
great
lakes
and
the
district
of
columbia
dismissed
on
the
condition
that
the
plaintiff
appear
in
canada
and
file
security
so
that
there
would
be
no
prejudice.
and
that
was
followed
in
a
later
decision
which
i'm
looking
for
and
can't
find
here
in
this
court
where
it
was
held
that
because
the
district
court
did
not
do
that,
it
was
improper.
that
is,
if
they
should
have
not
dismissed
without
entering
such
a
rule.
now,
there,
it
doesn't
matter
when
the
suit
could
have
been
brought
in
the
other
jurisdiction,
it's
merely
a
matter
of
--
at
this
time
cannot
be
brought.
and
it
seems
to
me,
that's
a
far
more
just
situation
and
otherwise.
for
example,
suppose
that
on
the
day
the
suit
is
filed,
the
plaintiff
lives
in
california
--
the
plaintiff
lives
in
new
york
and
the
defendant
lives
in
california.
on
the
day
after,
the
week
after,
he
moves
from
california
to
new
jersey
and
all
of
the
witnesses
happened
to
be
either
new
york
or
new
jersey.
obviously,
it's
not
a
just
thing
to
say
that
that
case
must
be
continued
in
california.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
time
to
look
at
it,
the
transfer
is
as
of
the
time
the
case
is
transferred,
namely
under
the
events
that
occurred.
now,
you
can
--
you
can
have
the
opposite
situation
too
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
flexible
while
using
the
flexible
rule
and
not
saying
it
was
a
fixed
period
of
time
when
everything
takes
effect.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
--
i
apologize
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
for
the
word.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
but
it
doesn't
say
when
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
merely
limit
it
to
be
brought,
this
has
been
pointed
out
in
these
decisions.
you
can
bring
the
patent
infringement
suit
anywhere
in
united
states
but
you
can't
successfully
prosecuted
it
there
unless
certain
things
occur.
now
therefore,
brought
doesn't
mean
brought.
it
means
something
more
and
you've
got
to
bring
in
something
more
to
explain
the
ambiguity.
well,
furthermore,
it
doesn't
say
whether
brought
now
or
brought
then.
both
of
those
same
words
could
be
intended
in
there
and
i
think
it's
clear.
now,
our
court
of
appeals,
two
to
one
and
said
that
that's
unambiguous.
well,
i
think
that
no
other
court
of
appeals
judge
even
--
including
the
two
and
the
third
circuit
that
dissented,
went
on
that
ground.
certainly,
the
--
there
are
17
court
of
appeals
judges
now
who
have
found
that
the
act
is
either
ambiguous
or
unambiguously
my
way.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir
he
could.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
and
on
the
day
of
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
and
on
the
day
of
the
transfer,
he
did
have
that
consent
in
his
pocket.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
about
what?
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
and
it
doesn't
say
whether
it
meant
at
the
date
of
the
--
where
the
case
was
filed
or
some
subsequent
date.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
that
--
that
there's
no
problem
to
me
on
that
if
you
say
amenable
to
process
at
the
time
of
the
motion,
justices
done
in
the
forum
non
conveniens
cases.
they
--
they
repeatedly
transferred
to
a
place
where
they
could
not
have
been
sued
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
brought
without
--
well,
they
couldn't
have.
that's
done
all
the
time.
they
don't
transfer
--
excuse
me,
they
dismiss
only
on
the
ground
that
there's
a
waiver.
i
misspoke
myself,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
oh
i
fell
that
way
too,
your
honor.
and
as
i
say,
you
have
to
look
at
the
situation
if
you
try
to
limit
it.
mr.
--
what
--
what
happens
where
the
defendant
is
in
europe
on
the
date
the
complaint
was
filed,
do
you
wait
until
he
gets
back
to
say
it
couldn't
have
been
brought
or
do
you
say
it
couldn't
have
been
brought
in
that
jurisdiction
because
he
wasn't
there
at
the
time.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
it's
our
position
however
that
if
there
are
two
meaning,
one
of
which
is
in
favor
of
petitioners'
position
that
the
three
factors
involved
here
require
adoption
of
that
meaning.
one,
because
of
the
legislative
history,
two,
because
it's
a
remedial
statute
which
should
be
literally
construed
and
three,
because
the
interest
of
justice
are
in
favor
of
the
transfer
which
was
made
here.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no.
i'm
merely
saying
that
if
it's
ambiguous,
then
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
and
my
position
on
that
is
that
no
matter
who
tries
to
interpret
where
it
might
have
been
brought
in
any
decision
that
i've
seen,
they've
always
added
something
to
it
to
explain
it
like
unsuccessfully
prosecuted
because
i
think
mr.
justice
whittaker
there
over
--
over
objections
seasonably
made
of
a
defendant.
if
you
have
to
have
that
language
to
make
it
clear,
then
it's
ambiguous.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
you
must
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
legislative
history
is
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
--
after
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
collet
case
and
the
national
city
lines
case.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
these
thirteen
bills
were
presented
to
limit
section
1404
(a).
they
were
under
consideration
for
some
years
by
the
judicial
conference
and
by
the
various
circuits.
at
the
end
of
that
time,
it
was
decided
not
to
make
any
change
in
the
law
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
rodney
and
the
kaufman
and
the
torres
and
the
josephson
case
which
had
been
handed
down
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
in
mr.
justice
whittaker's
case,
i
think
it
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
in
1955,
i
believe.
i
have
the
date
here.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
1954
or
1955,
127
f.supp.9
--
i
haven't
got
the
date
--
june
--
january
22nd,
1955.
so
that
had
also
come
down
by
the
time
the
act
was
actually
amended
in
which
they
merely
changed
the
jurisdictional
amount
and
certain
other
things,
but
they
did
not
change
the
section.
i
think
that
is
a
clear
indication
of
judicial
consideration
by
the
conference
and
the
congress,
by
the
very
people
who
are
most
concerned
with
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
1948,
i
don't
remember
the
month.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
the
rodney
case
came
in
1951.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
my
position
is
that
the
amendment
or
the
possibility
of
amending
section
1404
(a)
was
under
consideration
in
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
thereafter.
it
was
under
consideration
from
1951
until
1957
during
which
time
this
unbroken
line
of
courts
of
appeals'
decisions
came
down.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
--
the
amendment
proposed
was
a
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
proposal
was
to
add
a
section
(d),
the
preceding
provisions
of
this
section
shall
not
apply
to
any
civil
action
brought
under
any
act
of
congress
which
vest
in
the
plaintiff
a
choice
of
forum
in
which
to
bring
suit
and
does
not
provide
any
authority
for
the
transfer
of
the
same
to
any
other
district
or
division.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
think
so.
and
they
--
and
they
--
the
judicial
conference
said
they
favored
no
amendment
of
section
1404
(a).
and
i
think
that
while
it
is
not
a
direct
attempt
to
change
the
act
in
the
respects
or
behavior
under
consideration,
certainly
shows
that
the
judicial
conference
and
the
proper
committee
of
congress
was
in
close
touch
with
the
situation
on
1404
(a)
and
did
not
make
a
change.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
it
shows
that
--
as
i
read,
i
hope
i
can
find
it
but
again
that
the
--
the
committee,
this
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
here
is
the
(voice
overlap)
judicial
conference
committee
on
page
14
of
the
--
of
the
house
report
which
quotes
their
various
report,
says,
the
fourth
question
to
be
considered
by
the
conference
was
--
should
section
1404
(a)
of
the
revised
code
relating
to
transfers
be
repealed
or
amended.
and
that's
a
broad
statement
and
that
it
would
include
just
what
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
this
is
--
this
is
a
report
of
the
committee
–
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i'll
read
the
paragraph.
“your
committee
has
been
given
to
--
that
has
given
consideration
to
four
questions.
one,
should
the
jurisdiction
based
on
diversity
be
retained
and
two,
down
to
the
forum.”
and
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
that
was
from
the
congress
committee
or
whether
that
came
from
the
judicial
conference.
and
i
think
that
is
the
--
unfortunately
i
don't
have
all
the
pages
and
i
--
i'm
not
sure.
i'm
thinking
the
court
would
show
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
think
it
is.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
excuse
me.
i
--
that
--
i
think
we're
getting
off
on
the
wrong
foot.
what
i
said
was
if
it's
ambiguous,
then
there
are
three
reasons
why
it
should
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
liberal.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
reason
for
saying
it's
ambiguous
is
that
nobody
that
i
have
seen
yet
is
able
to
interpret
it
without
adding
something
to
it.
it
could
main
--
could
have
been
brought
now
or
then.
it
could
have
been
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well
i
may
--
there
maybe
--
there
were
so
many
cases
here
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
might
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
the
recollection
of
your
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
if
you'll
let
me
take
a
moment,
i'll
find
out
or
i
can
--
perhaps
i'll
find
out.
i
have
a
few
minutes
on
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
think
they
have
to
concede
it
because
it
was
found
by
the
court
as
a
finding
of
fact
and
that
is
not
brought
up
here
for
review.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
think
so
but
i'd
rather
have
them
as
to
that
your
honor,
there's
still
certainly
a
realm
of
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
they've
--
they've
said
frankly
that
the
only
issue
here
is
one
of
jurisdiction
which
would
obviously
eliminate
the
matter,
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
had
intended
to
argue
that
when
i
said
that
it
seemed
more
just
to
look
at
it
at
the
time
of
it
was
granted
within
some
other
time
and
also
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
of
course
this
act,
any
of
--
any
act
that's
passed
could
be
of
use.i
don't
think
we
should
look
at
that,
i
think
that
the
acts
purposes
are
salutary
and
should
be
expanded.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
it
is
limited.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
but
i
haven't
anything
to
guide
me
except
perhaps
prejudice
in
this
case
but
i
don't
think
that's
any
indications
if
that's
what
they
intended.
i
think
they
did
intend
to
bar,
as
we
pointed
it
out
and
it's
our
--
the
people
who
follow
has
pointed
out,
to
bar
those
cases
where
you
might
destroy
diversity
by
moving,
or
you
might
have
an
action
in
rem
but
you
couldn't
move
like
the
--
there's
one
of
the
other
cases
where
there
was
a
--
an
executor
who
couldn't
sue
in
the
foreign
jurisdiction.
i
think
those
are
reasonable
cases
and
i
think
that
there's
good
reason
for
using
the
term
to
cover
that
situation.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
certainly
--
certainly
preexisting
history.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
thank
you.
to
answer
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
about
the
place
in
his
opinion
where
the
--
i
thought
there
was
an
addition,
i
was
referring
to
page
824.
insofar
as
the
question
mr.
justice
black
just
asked
about
a
case
where
there
was
a
transfer
of
residence,
i
don't
know
of
any
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
in
the
internatio-rotterdam
case
218
f.2d
514
which
is
one
of
the
cases
referred
to
in
the
229
case,
the
(inaudible)
case,
it
appeared
that
the
boat
was
in
prospect
of
moving
into
the
district
to
which
the
case
was
transferred.
it
wasn't
there
at
the
time
but
they
thought
it
might
be
and
they
permitted
the
transfer
on
that
basis.
that's
the
only
case
i
know
of
where
it
was
in
residence
but
it
was
a
possibility
that
the
change
might
take
place.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
think
that
either
party
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
i
think
either
party
should
be
under
those
conditions
for
the
convenience
of
the
witnesses
and
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
sir.
but
that
it
could've
been
brought
there
at
the
time
of
the
motion.
it's
our
position
that
the
transfer
could
be
made.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
and
the
one
question
which
i
wish
to
post
in
closing
is
that
if
in
view
of
the
question
as
to
jurisdiction
which
has
--
have
been
asked,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
overruling
rodney,
and
the
kaufman
and
josephson
cases
and
the
hundreds
which
i
suppose
have
been
--
have
followed
them
without
opinion
and
have
gone
to
final
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
there
might
be
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
might
be
subject
to
collateral
attack.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
should
think
there
was
an
implied
finding,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
have
before
me
whether
there
were
any
findings
of
fact
made
in
addition
to
the
order
of
transfer
but
certainly
they're
not
in
it.
i
would
think
it
presupposes
that
but
it
--
i
don't
find
any
specific
statement
of
it.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
if
the
--
yes
and
then
245
f.2d.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
opinion
on
mandamus
was
at
page
9
of
the
record,
your
honor.
and
it
held
the
district
court
was
empowered
by
the
statute
to
make
the
transfer
to
which
i
would
say
went
into
the
jurisdictional
factor.
