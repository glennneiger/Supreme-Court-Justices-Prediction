mr.
john
c.
butler
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
associate
justices,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
this
certiorari
review
presents
the
question
whether
a
district
judge
is
authorized
by
virtue
of
section
1404
(a)
of
the
judicial
code,
to
transfer
on
motion
of
the
defendants,
a
diversity
action
pending
before
him
to
a
forum
where
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses
in
the
interest
of
justice
would
best
be
served,
but,
wherein
the
venue
of
the
transferee
forum
and
the
reach
of
its
process
was
supplied
by
the
assurances
of
the
defendants
to
wave
their
venue
privilege
and
to
enter
their
personal
appearances.
however,
the
transferee
forum
was
run
which
was
competent
to
hear
the
issues
in
the
suit,
such
forum
independently
possessed
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
case
by
virtue
of
the
diversity
of
citizenship
of
the
parties.
more
generally,
this
case
presents
for
determination
the
question
whether
federal
district
courts
are
authorized
to
transfer
actions
either
on
motion
of
plaintiff
or
of
defendant
to
another
forum
which
has
become
available
since
the
commencement
of
the
action
by
reason
of
such
post-suit
circumstances
as,
one,
a
change
in
the
residence
of
the
parties,
or
two,
a
plaintiff
for
a
defendant
corporation's
qualification
or
doing
of
business
in
such
other
forum,
or
three,
a
defendant's
consent
to
an
acceptance
of
the
venue
in
process
of
the
transferee
forum.
in
all
such
instances,
i
presuppose
that
such
a
transfer
would
be
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses
and
in
the
interest
of
justice
were
that
not
so
the
question
of
the
authority
of
the
district
judge
would
be
academic.
the
facts,
out
of
which
the
present
question
arose
in
this
case
are
these.
respondents,
one,
a
citizen
of
illinois
and
the
other
a
citizen
of
new
york
filed
suit
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
charging
the
two
defendants,
standard
oil
company
and
indiana
corporation
and
standard
oil
foundation,
inc
and
indiana
charitable
corporation
with
acquiring
the
assets
of
a
utah
corporation
at
less
than
the
fair
value
of
such
assets.
plaintiffs,
who
are
respondents
here
on
respectively
900
and
1000
shares
of
stock
in
the
utah
company,
the
two
defendants
owned
approximately
76%
of
the
outstanding
stock
of
the
utah
company.
and
the
defendants
had
organized
to
wholly
on
subsidiary
which
offered
to
buy
all
of
the
assets
of
such
--
of
such
company.
this
offer
was
considered
at
the
special
meeting
of
the
shareholders
of
the
company
and
was
accepted.
the
charge
against
the
defendants
is
that
they,
together
with
52
so
called
controlled
stockholders
in
the
utah
corporation,
permitted
the
sale
of
these
assets
at
a
price
less
than
fair
value.
the
plaintiffs
sued
not
in
the
right
of
the
utah
company
but
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
all
other
stockholders
who
are
or
were
similarly
situated.
those
stockholders
are
called
minority
stockholders
in
the
complaint.
jurisdiction
of
the
action
was
bottomed
upon
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
residence
of
the
defendants
was
not
alleged
nor
did
the
complaint
occur
that
the
venue
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
was
proper.
defendants
however,
did
not
raise
this
question
and
so
they
have
waived
it.
the
day
following
the
answers
of
the
defendants
in
which
they
denied
the
crucial
substantive
allegations
of
the
complaint,
they
filed
a
motion
to
transfer
the
action
to
the
district
of
utah,
central
division
which
is
at
salt
lake
city.
petitioner
granted
the
motion
to
transfer
saying
that,
and
i
quote
“if
i
have
the
power
to
do
so,
i
would
be
guilty
of
an
abuse
of
the
discretion
vested
in
me
by
section
1404
(a)
of
the
judicial
code
if
i
refuse
to
transfer
this
action
to
salt
lake
city.”
in
some,
there
were
eight
reasons
which
moved
the
petitioner
to
this
conclusion.
these
are
set
forth
at
pages
88
and
89
of
the
record
and
they're
summarized
at
page
5
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
an
important
reason
among
those
eight
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
class
on
whose
behalf
of
the
two
respondents
have
volunteered
to
act,
consists
of
920
shareholders.
575
of
them
reside
in
utah
and
134
more
in
california,
washington
and
idaho.
however,
petitioner's
order
of
transfer
was
stayed
by
the
issuance
of
the
writ
of
mandamus
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
that
court
stated
that
petitioner
did
not
have
the
power
to
transfer,
since
the
transfer
reform
must
be
a
district
were
a
plaintiff
has
a
right
to
sue
independently
of
the
wishes
of
defendant.
if
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
this
right,
independently
of
the
wishes
of
the
defendant,
it
is
not
a
district
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
now,
since
venue
and
personal
jurisdiction
in
this
instance
where
available
to
the
plaintiffs
in
utah,
only
by
reason
of
the
post
of
assurances
of
the
defendants,
under
the
standards
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
such
assurances
were
unavailing
and
transfer
was
unauthorized.
so
holding,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
question
which
respondents
had
also
raised
before
them
as
to
the
exercise
of
the
petitioner's
discretion.
the
court
of
appeals
said
whether
or
not
he
and
his
judge
sullivan
properly
exercised
his
discretion
in
the
mistaken
and
the
belief
that
he
did
have
such
power,
it
will
be
unnecessary
for
us
to
decide.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
not
the
phrase
“where
it
might
have
been
brought,”
as
such
appears
in
section
1404
(a).
and
incidentally,
in
my
view,
a
most
deceptively
simple
phrase
is
at
least
an
ambiguus
phrase
and
that
it
does
not
establish
the
time
of
determination
as
to
the
where.
as
mr.
merriam
has
pointed
out
yesterday,
the
courts
which
have
dealt
with
this
matter
have
spoken
of
such
time
in
terms
of
commenced
or
could
now
be
brought
or
maybe
prosecuted
and
so
forth.
that
you
will
find
rehearsed
in
the
paramount
pictures
versus
rodney
case
and
in
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
magruder
in
the
josephson
case.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
this
phrase
been
at
the
least
ambiguous
because
of
its
silence
about
the
matter
of
when
one
is
to
determine
where
an
action
might
have
been
brought.
should
be
interpreted
so
as
to
confer
upon
the
district
courts
the
power
to
transfer
if
at
the
time
the
power
is
exercised,
the
transferee
forum
is,
one,
where
the
action
might
have
been
brought.
such
an
interpretation
will
in
the
petitioner's
view
and
here
i
quote
from
chief
judge
magruder,
“enhance
the
usefulness
of
this
important
provision
for
transfer
of
cases
in
the
interest
of
convenience
and
justice.”
the
transfer
provision
so
construed
will
then
be
available
to
both
plaintiff
and
defendant.
an
instance
was
mentioned
yesterday
by
mr.
merriam,
which
i
should
like
briefly
to
repeat
here
today.
“let
us
suppose
a
case
of
a
plaintiff
being
a
new
york
resident,
being
involved
in
an
accident
in
new
jersey,
occasioned
by
the
negligence
of
a
defendant,
who
is
a
california
citizen.
and
the
defendant
being
merely
momentarily
in
the
state
is
not
available
for
the
process
and
then
it
would
be
improper
because
it
would
be
either
new
york
or
california.”
after
suit
is
filed
and
this
is
a
hypothetical
case,
but
after
suit
is
filed,
let
us
assume
that
the
defendant
moves
to
new
jersey.
plaintiff
in
order
to
have
sued
the
defendant
had
to
proceed
to
california.
may
he
not
move
to
transfer
his
case
to
new
jersey
where
on
my
supposition,
the
cause
of
action
arose,
the
witnesses
reside
and
where
all
of
the
convenience
of
the
witnesses
in
the
interest
of
justice
will
best
be
served
by
having
the
court
there
hear
the
case.
if
the
contention
--
if
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
my
circuit
is
correct,
that
would
be
denied
to
the
plaintiff
in
my
hypothetical
case.
mr.
john
c.
butler
the
plaintiff
in
my
hypothetical
case,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
could
sue
in
new
jersey
and
drop
a
suit
in
california,
but
he
couldn't
transfer
it
because
at
the
time
he
filed
his
suit
in
california
which
was
the
only
place
he
could
then
reach
the
defendant,
this
--
the
forum
of
new
jersey
was
unavailable
to
him.
mr.
john
c.
butler
that
is
correct.
except
in
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation,
that
is
true.
if
you
then
say
by
brought,
you
mean
not
only
commenced
but
service
of
process
acquired.
there
are
some
cases,
district
court
cases
earlier
which
have
gone
off
on
the
thought
that
commenced
is
equivalent
to
brought
and
have
transferred
on
that
basis.
mr.
john
c.
butler
assuming
as
i
always
do
that
the
interest
of
justice
would
there
be
served.
the
plaintiff,
i
should
think
would
have
his
option
to
ask
the
court
to
transfer
the
case
to
montana.
mr.
john
c.
butler
and
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
the
defendant
as
well,
either
side.
mr.
john
c.
butler
under
the
circumstances
of
my
case,
i
would
fail
to
see
where
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses
would
--
would
be
served
by
a
transfer.
but
passing
that
and
speaking
in
terms
only
of
the
authority,
i
would
assume
that
being
then
a
forum
available
at
the
time,
either
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
could
move
and
the
case
be
transferred
there.
mr.
john
c.
butler
the
--
the
change
of
residence
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
having
been
prior
to
the
suit?
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
john
c.
butler
well,
i'm
talking
of
the
general
diversity
cases.
mr.
john
c.
butler
so
that,
montana
would
presumably
be
a
correct
forum.
not
being
a
district
of
the
residence
of
the
defendant.
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
john
c.
butler
mr.
chief
justice,
the
questions
in
the
case
preceding
and
in
this
case
are
approximately
the
same.
i
would
say
this,
that
if
there
be
a
reversal
in
the
preceding
case,
i
believe
that
our
for
certiorari,
there
should
be
a
reversal
here
because
there
is
involved
in
the
patent
case
a
particularized
venue
provision
whereas
i
am
speaking
in
terms
on
the
framework
of
the
diversity
action.
mr.
john
c.
butler
that
if
a
defendant
in
the
diversity
case
moves,
or
in
a
patent
case,
where
it
could
have
moved
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
--
to
montana
prior
to
the
infringement
suit
against
him.
yes,
then
it
would
be
a
proper
forum,
as
i
understand
section
1401
(b).
mr.
john
c.
butler
well,
i
believe
there
is
a
choice
of
a
residence
or
where
he
has
a
--
a
place
of
business
and
has
committed
acts
of
infringement.
so,
by
definition,
montana
would
be
a
proper
forum.
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
butler
not
under
those
precise
circumstances.
but,
there
have
been
many
cases,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
where
plaintiffs
have
invoked
section
1404
(a).
mr.
john
c.
butler
where
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
john
c.
butler
let
me
mention
particularly
one
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes.
well
now,
involved
in
the
torres
versus
walsh
case
was
the
companion
case
which
is
not
too
much
discussed
by
the
court
of
appeals
but
was
involved
in
the
court
below.
mr.
john
c.
butler
the
decision
there
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
torres
which
is
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes.
its
221
f.2d
319
but
the
district
court
decision
was
not
mentioned
as
such
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
c.
butler
29
--
319.
the
case
below,
the
companion
case
to
the
admiralty
action
in
torres
is
thompson
products
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
company
and
its
citation
is
127
f.supp.
449.
that
came
up
under
the
name,
i
believe,
pennsylvania
railroad
company
versus
dawson,
judge
dawson
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
mr.
john
c.
butler
no.
mr.
john
c.
butler
this
was
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
sued
the
defendant
railroad
company
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
an
action
for
damages
to
a
shipment
over
the
defendant
railroad,
consigned
to
the
plaintiff.
after
filling
a
suit,
the
plaintiff
found
that
the
damage
might
have
been
caused
by
improper
loading
by
the
consignor,
landis
tool
company
of
waynesboro,
pennsylvania.
so,
the
plaintiff
then
moved
to
transfer
his
action
which
he
had
filed
in
new
york
city
to
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania
where
both
the
railroad
and
the
consignor
could
be
sued.
he
was
particularly
interested
in
doing
that
because
where
he
to
file
a
new
suit
in
pennsylvania,
the
statute
of
limitations
against
the
railroad
on,
i
believe,
a
bill
of
lading
was
about
to
expire
and
he
would
have
been
out,
as
to
the
railroad,
and
the
court
granted
the
motion.
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes.
and
it
is
silent
insofar
as
to
the
when.
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes.
now,
petitioner
would
suggest
that
these
following
considerations
which
would
support
his
--
his
contention.
first,
that
when
a
motion
to
transfer
is
presented
to
the
district
judge,
he
of
course,
would
look
to
see
if
the
present
circumstances
are
such
that
the
interest
of
justice
would
best
be
served
by
such
transfer
in
the
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses.
he
would
not,
in
other
words,
look
to
some
preceding
point
in
the
past
time
to
determine
whether
the
interest
of
justice
would
then
be
served.
but
rather,
is
it
now,
to
be
served
by
such
a
transfer.
and
the
petitioner
suggests
this,
that
if
that
be
the
case,
if
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
should
be
presently
made
should
not
contemporaneously
also,
his
power
to
transfer
be
determined.
mr.
john
c.
butler
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
very
logical.
the
question
is
now
assuming
that
you
do
not
know
when
--
the
where
it
might
have
been
brought
is
to
be
fixed.
that
a
--
the
parallel
determination
of
whether
it
is
not
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
transfer
should
be
a
contemporaneous
factor.
mr.
john
c.
butler
well,
sir,
chief
judge
magruder
has
suggested
that
he
might
do
just
that
very
thing.
mr.
john
c.
butler
i
believe,
that
assuming,
that
we're
talking
on
framework
of
a
diversity
action
and
that
venue
would
be
proper,
as
i
presume
it
would
be.
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes.
so
that
the
question
would
be
the
availability
to
service,
but
by
definition,
that
has
been
accomplished
when
the
suit
is
first
filed
in
the
transfer
or
a
forum.
so
that
presumably,
the
transfer
would
then
be
proper.
mr.
john
c.
butler
and
i
should
think
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
well,
that
and
the
availability
of
the
transferee
forum
at
the
time
the
--
a
motion
to
transfer
is
passed
upon.
mr.
john
c.
butler
well
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
well,
because
i
--
well,
i'm
saying
is
the
same
thing,
mr.
justice
black
and
that
is
this,
that
by
definition,
venue
always
obtained
in
the
diversity
case.
service
of
process
has
been
accomplished
before
the
motion
to
transfer
is
made,
in
the
transfer
or
forum.
and
chief
judge
magruder
has
suggested
that
the
service
of
process,
once
accomplished,
need
not
be
repeated
in
the
transferee
forum.
mr.
john
c.
butler
well
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
--
the
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
that
the
venue
would
be
proper.
chief
justice
magruder
did
not,
and
say
that
you
could
transfer
it
in
the
improper
venue.
mr.
john
c.
butler
then
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
that
then
would
not
be
sufficient
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
--
in
my
view.
mr.
john
c.
butler
because
there
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
because
it
would
be
going
beyond
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
well,
the
statute
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes,
that's
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
mr.
john
c.
butler
that
is
where
it
might
have
been
brought
if
at
that
time,
it
might
have
been
brought
there.
then
the
wording
of
the
statute
will
satisfy
it.
mr.
john
c.
butler
i
don't
believe
so,
with
all
deference.
i
--
i
see
that
i
am
running
out
of
time,
but
i'd
like
to
mention
one
perfect
point.
and
that
is
this,
that
section
1404
(a)
is
the
remedial
statute,
it
was
--
it
adopted
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
the
doctrine
forum
non
conveniens
as
it
--
that
a
court
may
dismiss
conditions
being
satisfied
if
there
is
an
available
forum
as
an
alternate
which
is
the
more
convenient
forum.
well,
i'd
like
to
make
this
point
clear,
that
nowhere
have
i
found
a
non
conveniens
--
forum
non
conveniens
case
which
requires
the
availability
of
the
alternate
more
convenient
forum
to
exist
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed.
and
i
should
like
to
call
particularly
to
the
court's
attention,
the
case
of
vargas
versus
a.
h.
bull
steamship
company.
a
very
well
reasoned
decision
by
a
court
in
new
jersey,
the
law
division
of
the
superior
court,
who's
opinion
was
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
involving
a
jones
act
case,
a
federally
created
right
of
action.
certiorari
was
sought
and
because
the
court
there
did
conditionally
dismiss
the
case
and
certiorari
was
refused
by
this
court.
i
should
like
to
point
this
out,
that
if
the
present
case
had
been
filed
some
five
moths
after
it
was.
it
could
not
have
been
filed
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
although
no
charges
made
in
the
complaint,
counsel
for
the
respondents
in
an
affidavit
have
suggested
that
the
principal
office,
the
place
of
business
of
standard
oil
company
is
in
chicago.
and
under
the
amendment
of
section
1332
which
was
enacted
july
25th,
1958,
that
then
would
make
standard
a
resident
of
illinois
for
purposes
of
diversity
and
there
would
be
an
illinois
plaintiff
and
illinois
defendant.
diversity
would
be
destroyed
and
presumably,
the
plaintiff
would
then
have
recourse
only
to
the
state
courts
of
illinois.
in
which
event,
illinois
having
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
would
do
as,
it
was
done
in
the
rogers
case
in
new
jersey
conditionally
dismissed
the
case
on
the
insurances
there.
they
have
been
given
to
the
district
court
in
this
case,
namely
that
they
would
accept
the
venue
in
the
process
of
the
alternate
forum
which
is
the
much
more
convenient
forum.
it
would
be
in
other
words,
i
should
think,
rather
strange
to
construe
section
1404
(a)
in
a
fashion
which
would
be
somewhat
retrogressive
denying
it
the
authority,
the
power,
or
the
scope
which
as
antecedent
doctrine
possesses.
particularly,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
section
1404
(a)
has
been
well
regarded
as
a
remedial
statute
and
its
provision
should
be
given
hospitable
scope.
i
might
add
that
to
give
the
construction
that
the
petitioner
contends
for
here,
does
not
make
mere
surplusage
of
the
phrase
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”
because
we
have
three
factors
to
consider,
venue,
personal
jurisdiction
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
venue
is
a
mere
privilege.
personal
jurisdiction
can
be
accepted
by
the
parties
but
if
it's
beyond
the
scope
of
the
litigants
to
confer
subject
matter
jurisdiction
on
the
court,
therefore,
there
is
content,
substance
of
vital
nature
in
the
phrase
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”.
because
you
cannot
--
even
though
you
have
venue
and
personal
jurisdiction
transfer
an
action
to
another
forum
which
does
not
posses
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
c.
butler
venue
and
personal
service,
the
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
butler
because
where
it
might
have
been
brought
are
words
of
limitation.
but
the
stat
--
the
statute
does
not
tell
us
when
the
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”
is
to
be
determined.
mr.
john
c.
butler
no.
mr.
john
c.
butler
not
in
this
sense,
so
we
contend.
mr.
john
c.
butler
i
think,
they
where
trying
to
conform
with
venue
and
personal
jurisdiction
requirements,
but
at
the
same
time,
within
that
limitation
to
expand
the
availability
of
forums
to
hear
and
determine
cases
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
john
c.
butler
that's
right.
that
is
right.
i
think
that
--
i
see
my
times
up.
i'll
make
this
comment.
i
think,
congress
had
in
mind
to
promote
the
interest
of
justice
to
make
transfers
--
mr.
john
c.
butler
(voice
overlap)
dismissals
or
to
make
transfers
much
more
available.
mr.
john
c.
butler
that
is
true.
and
it's
inherent
in
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
which
must
be
preserved.
in
other
words,
you
cannot
transfer
a
case
and
thereby
destroy
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
hear
and
determine.
thank
you
very
much
for
you
kind
attention.
