mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
answer
to
your
inquiry
a
moment
ago
of
mr.
merriam
as
to
whether
or
not
the
respondents
disagree
with
the
idea
that
the
interpretation
of
mr.
merriam
is
asking
for
with
respect
to
the
statute,
whether
we
agree
to
that
would
be
in
the
interest
of
justice.
in
the
narrow
sense,
we
--
we
aren't
quarreling
with
the
convenience
of
parties
and
interest
of
justice
in
the
sense
of
the
statute.
that
is
now
involved
here.
it's
strictly
here,
a
question
of
power.
we
haven't
appealed
from
the
district
courts'
finding
in
texas
as
to
the
convenience
of
parties
and
that
we
don't
agree
with
them
but
that
isn't
--
doesn't
have
any
element
here.
all
--
our
question
is
here
is
whether
the
court
have
the
power
to
do
it.
now,
if
you
are
asking
--
if
the
question
was,
“do
we
agree
that
in
general
it
would
be
an
interest
of
justice?”
our
answer
is
emphatically
no
and
we
think
it
would
be
great
injustice
and
that
--
that
it
would
be
giving
a
defendant
a
power
which
neither
party
ever
had
before
and
it
would
be
giving
a
defendant
power
that
a
plaintiff
doesn't
have
now.
a
defendant
could
then
transfer
the
case
into
any
district
in
the
50
states,
merely
on
the
finding
of
a
district
judge
that
would
be
for
the
inconvenience
of
parties
on
the
defendants
own
motion.
the
plaintiff
doesn't
have
--
doesn't
have
that
power.
the
--
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no,
only
to
a
certain
sense,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
section
1404,
or
1400
(b),
the
patent
statute,
is
very
specific
and
it
says
that
a
patent
infringement
action
maybe
brought
and
i
quote
the
words
“may
be
brought,”
in
a
place
where
the
defendant
as
a
resident
or
in
a
place
where
he
has
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
has
an
--
regular
and
established
place
of
business.
so
the
plaintiff
is
very
definitely
limited
to
only
those
places.
in
this
case
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
that
--
that
is
true.
that
--
but
this
is
not
a
waiver
of
venue
case,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
yes
--
he
is
limited
in
this
--
this
is
not
a
waiver
of
venue
statute
case
at
all
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
because
in
a
waiver
of
venue
case,
you
have
a
stipulation
or
a
waiver
by
both
sides.
in
other
words,
either
both
parties
stipulate
to
try
it
in
a
jurisdiction
which
would
otherwise
be
improper.
or
a
plaintiff
brings
it
in
an
improper
district
and
therefore,
waives
his
objection
to
it
and
then
the
defendant
comes
in
and
waives
venue,
answers
and
goes
ahead.
so
that
in
that
instance,
there
is
a
waiver
on
both
sides.
here,
the
plaintiff
brought
this
action
in
the
only
place
under
patent
statutes
they
could
bring
in
texas.
the
defendants
then
moved
to
transfer
it
to
illinois.
the
petitioner
agrees
that
--
and
all
parties
agreed
that
it
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
first
place
against
the
defendant
in
illinois.
the
plaintiff
has
never
consent
--
consented
to
it
because
the
plaintiff
has
opposed
it
from
the
first.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
so
you
don't
have
a
waiver
of
venue
situation
at
all
and
if
this
case
could
be
transferred
to
illinois
under
the
statute,
there
is
no
reason
why
on
the
defendant's
motion,
it
couldn't
have
been
transferred
to
any
district
in
the
united
states.
there'd
be
just
as
much
justification
for
it
as
long
as
the
court
found
--
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses.
it's
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes
but
--
but
your
honor,
the
plaintiff
--
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
if
--
if
the
court
found
it,
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
that
right,
your
honor,
under
any
circumstances
if
the
defendant
is
against
it
on
both.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes
your
honor.
the
foster-milburn
versus
knight
case
well,
is
an
--
is
an
instance
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
where
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
the
plaintiffs
transferred
and
moved
for
the
transfer
and
the
defendant
said
no.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well
there
are
cases
--
there
are
cases
denying
--
and
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
your
honor,
there
are
cases
denying
transfer
to
other
districts
on
plaintiff's
motion
on
the
ground
that
the
other
district
is
in
action
in
which
it
could
not
have
been
brought.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
as
--
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
there's
no
decision
in
there,
no.
in
this
--
one
thing
that
it
is
important
to
remember
in
this
case
with
respect
to
section
1400
--
1404
(a)
is
that
there
are
two
parts
of
that
section.
the
first
is
--
the
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses
and
--
and
--
but
then
assuming
that
the
court
does
find
that
there
are
--
if
for
the
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses,
then
what
does
this
section,
the
statute
provide?
does
it
say
that
you
can
then
transfer
to
any
district?
it
doesn't.
it
says
any
district
in
which
it
might
have
been
brought.
now
of
course
it's
well-established
law
and
--
that
you
have
to
give
words
meaning
if
possible
to
all
the
words
of
the
statute.
the
court
itself
has
stated
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
menasche
that
it
is
our
duty
to
give
effect
if
possible
to
every
clause
and
word
of
a
statute
and
of
course
that
that's
the
established
statutory
construction
rule.
now,
so
that
if
the
words
where
it
might
have
been
brought
are
to
be
given
any
meaning,
then
of
course
the
next
question
is,
“well,
what
meaning
should
it
be
given?”
well,
it
--
we
submit
that
it's
only
sensible
when
congress
has
provided
in
one
section
of
a
statute
that
an
action
maybe
transferred
to
a
district
where
it
might
have
been
brought
that
you
then
look
and
see
if
congress
has
provided
in
the
statutes
for
that
particular
kind
of
action
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
and
in
section
1400
(b),
it
specifically
says
that
a
patent
infringement
action
maybe
brought
in
place
of
residence
of
the
defendant
or
where
he
is,
committed
acts
of
infringement
or
--
and
has
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
of
course
assuming
that
the
defendant
is
willing
to
do
it
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
you
--
you
could
bring
it
--
you
could
bring
it
anywhere,
your
honor,
yes.
i
mean
no,
that
instance
you
could
because
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
if
--
if
a
defendant
is
willing.
what
we're
talking
about
is
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
when
one
party
isn't
willing.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
not
as
long
as
both
parties
are
willing,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no.
the
--
that
is
correct.
now
--
now
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no.
no,
your
honor.
as
far
as
bringing
it,
that
isn't
really
involved
here.
the
big
thing
here
is
though
that
it
is
well-established
law
of
course
that
the
district
court
do
not
have
the
power
to
transfer
an
action
to
another
--
another
district
except
by
reason
of
1404
(a).
and
prior
to
1404
(a),
they
have
no
such
power.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
so
if
they
obtained
power
from
congress
which
is
the
only
way
they
could
have
obtained
it,
then
the
thing
is
--
what
did
congress
intend
to
give
him.
if
the
interpretation,
the
counsel
of
petitioner
is
putting
on
is
to
be
used
here,
then
that
section
in
the
statute
would
have
--
have
been
complete
if
it
had
been
--
if
it
had
finished
in
stating
that
it
maybe
transferred
to
any
other
district.
the
words
where
it
might
have
been
brought
are
rendered
meaningless
on
the
thing.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no
i
say
--
i
--
i
say
what
--
i
say
what
counsel
for
petitioner's
standing,
but
not
--
not
from
what
you
mentioned.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
counsel
for
petitioner
made
some
remarks
as
to
the
exact
words.
if
you
look
at
the
exact
words,
your
honor,
as
to
might
have
been
brought,
that
doesn't
say
or
it
may
have
been
brought
now,
may
--
might
have
been
--
it
says
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
and
if
--
if
anything,
if
that
word
“might”
would
mean
anything
in
reading
it
at
the
time
of
the
transfer,
it's
in
a
past
sense
to
where
it
might
have
been
brought
originally
instead
of
where
it
may
have
been
brought
now.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no,
but
it
--
no,
but
it
--
it
is
--
let's
point
it
the
other
way
and
also
as
--
as
to,
this
been
a
remedial
statute.
neither
plaintiff
nor
defendant
prior
to
1404
(a)
had
a
right
to
force
the
other
party
into
a
district
in
which
that
district
in
that
--
into
which
that
party
did
not
want
to
go
unless
it
came
within
a
statutory
provision
permitting
it.
and
that
for
instance,
in
a
patent
infringement
action
you
could
bring
it
against
the
defendant
in
his
place
of
residence
or
where
he
had
an
established
place
of
business
and
was
infringing.
and
the
plaintiff
have
the
right
to
choose
those
forms.
if
there
was
a
selection
form,
he
had
a
right
to
choose
one
but
he
couldn't
just
arbitrarily
pick
a
district
and
bring
it.
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendant
could
not
do
that
either.
he
couldn't
do
that
against
the
plaintiff.
he
couldn't
just
force
him
into
an
--
any
arbitrary
district.
now,
speaking
of
this
as
a
remedial
statute
and
now
saying
that
--
that
congress
in
--
in
making
applicable
the
--
the
doctrine
of
forum
of
non
conveniens
to
these
cases,
not
only
did
that
but
gave
the
defendant
a
new
power.
i
--
i
think
he
is
going
entirely
too
far.
there
is
no
basis
for
it.
here
if
the
--
if
congress
would
have
given
the
defendant
a
brand
new
power
to
force
that
the
plaintiff
into
any
district
in
the
united
states
in
which
the
defendant
move
to
move
and
the
court
found
it
was
convenient
and
it
never
had
that
power
before.
and
i
think
that
if
congress
had
ever
intended
to
give
that
revolutionary
power
to
a
defendant,
it
would
have
very
carefully
spelled
it
out.
and
then
--
and
most
certainly,
it
would
have
left
out
the
words
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
they
wouldn't
have
put
in
limiting
words
like
that
to
--
that
are
definitely
limiting
in
their
sense.
under
the
doctrine,
the
--
under
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
this
court
has
specifically
said
in
the
gulf
oil
company
case
that
in
all
cases
in
which
doctrine
of
forum
of
non
conveniens
comes
into
play,
it
presupposes
at
least
two
forums
in
which
the
defendant
is
amenable
to
process
and
that
doctrine
furnishes
criteria
for
choice
between
them.
now,
the
petitioner
in
his
opinion
in
this
case
at
page
17
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
admits
that
this
case
would
not
have
been
fileable
in
illinois
under
the
doctrine
forum
non
conveniens.
he's
--
he
said
and
i
quote,
"since
it
appears
that
the
defendants
are
not
amendable
to
process
in
illinois,
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
could
not
have
been
applied
at
the
case
(inaudible).”
this
court
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
excuse
me?
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
that
is
not
my
understanding
your
honor.
my
understanding
is
and
i
think,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
gulf
oil
corp.
case
is
the
controlling
case
in
--
in
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
in
my
--
my
understanding
of
that
ruling
is
that
there
had
to
be
two
forums,
two
proper
forums.
i
mean
i
--
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
saying.
now,
they
don't
say
it
in
that
many
words.
i
--
i
mean
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
of
what?
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
oh
i
mean,
origin
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
i
mean
the
proper
forums
where
you
could
force
the
plaintiff
or
you
could
force
the
other
party
to
try
it
--
and
so
that
there's
only
a
choice
of
the
forums
agreement.
and
that
is
my
opinion
and
i
personally
feel
that
that
is
the
--
they
weight
of
authority.
now,
in
the
ex
parte
collett
case,
this
court
has
specifically
recognized
that
the
purpose
of
section
1404
(a)
was
to
render
applicable
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
in
the
first
paragraph
of
that
opinion
at
page
56
in
the
3367
u.s.
it
stated,
"in
this
case,
we
decide
whether
--
we
must
decide
whether
the
venue
provisions
of
the
judicial
code
rendered
applicable
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
to
actions
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act."
and
it
went
on
to
answer
that
question
in
the
affirmative
and
the
basis
for
the
answering
in
the
affirmative
was
that
it
rendered
it
applicable
to
all
civil
actions,
to
any
civil
actions
and
therefore
run
it.
so
this
court
itself
has
specifically
said
that
the
--
that
1404
(a)
was
to
render
applicable
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
it
means
no
--
that
--
no,
that's
right
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes.
that
--
that's
right
your
honor.
no,
you
couldn't
actually
transfer
under
the
doctrine.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
so
that
--
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
the
defendants
were
residents
of
illinois?
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
in
this
instance,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no,
your
honor
the
defendants
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
then
it's
move,
alright.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
certainly
no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
because
--
because
the
court
did
not
have
the
power
to
transfer
it.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
i
--
i
--
well,
i
--
i
would
have
to
answer
that
in
two
parts,
your
honor
if
i
may.
number
one,
i
grant
that
a
plaintiff
and
defendant
if
they
both
get
together
and
say,
"we're
going
to
sue
out
in
utah.”
although
neither
one
of
them
had
a
right
to
be
there,
you
can
do
it.
therefore
as
a
practical
matter,
a
court
no
doubt
would
say,
"well,
we'll
make
this
transfer
out
here"
and
then
never
would
be
any
--
it
--
it
never
come
up
to
be
to
the
--
for
a
decision
because
both
sides
were
happy
in
going
out
there
anyway
and
--
and
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
that
--
that
is
correct
but,
your
honor,
while
if
you
gone
out
in
utah
and
both
parties
went
ahead
and
tried
it
without
any
objection
to
it,
there
is
a
possible
waiver
there
anyway.but
--
so
it
--
it
would
--
it
--
i
--
i
don't
think
it
had
come
up
but
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well
i
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
my
--
my
answer
would
be
that
technically,
no,
you
couldn't.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
wouldn't
arise
--
i
mean
the
problem
wouldn't
arise
for
decision
because
you
need
the
both
side
of
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
because
they
could
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no.
i
--
i'd
say
that
that's
--
technically,
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction
but
of
course
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
could
get
together
and
stipulate
and
go
ahead
and
try
the
case
in
illinois
anyway.
they
could
re-file
it
if
necessary
because
both
sides
have
agreed
to
a
decision.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
if
both
sides
are
agreeing
to
it.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
lawsuit.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no,
no,
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no,
that's
what
i
mean
your
honor.
they
--
they
could
--
they
could
actually
file.
i
mean
the
plaintiff
could
go
ahead
and
file
in
illinois
and
the
defendant
could
come
in
and
answer
and
--
and
they'd
--
would
get
their
trial
in
illinois.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
also,
your
honor
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
not
--
not,
your
honor
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
but
they
weren't
being
treated
alike,
your
honor.
if
the
plaintiff
can
be
forced
into
a
--
an
improper
district
because
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
that
right
against
the
defendant.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
one
--
one
of
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
one
of
the
main
things
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
--
where
it
might
have
been
brought
should
be
is
that
congress
in
another
section
of
the
statute
has
specifically
provided
in
the
patent
infringement
in
--
in
1400
--
1400
(b)
has
specifically
provided
that
a
patent
infringement
maybe
brought
in
certain
qualified
districts.
and
we
--
we
submit
that
it's
reasonable
to
read
the
words
“might
have
been
brought”
then
with
respect
to
patent
infringement
action
as
being
--
were
congress
specifically
stated
patent
infringement
of
an
actions
maybe
brought.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
the
--
the
fact
that
the
--
the
defendant
might
have
the
right
to
waive
it
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
if
the
plaintiff
is
willing.
we
submit,
this
is
a
remedial
statute
to
protect
the
defendant.
it
shouldn't
be
construed
to
--
beyond
that
to
say
that
we
are
giving
the
defendant
a
new
power
of
which
he
never
had
before
and
we
are
now
permitting
him
to
force
the
defendant
--
the
plaintiff
into
a
district
in
which
he
never
could've
forced
him
before.
if
congress
had
intended
to
give
that
revolutionary
power,
we
submit
that
they
would
have
carefully
spelled
it
out.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
but
the
--
they
have
never
had
that
power
before
and
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
that
power
now.
so
--
and
--
so
that
if
it's
a
remedial
statute
to
protect
the
defendant,
it
shouldn't
be
construed
that
far
to
give
it
this
brand
new
revolutionary
power
that
a
defendant
never
had
before.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
right
and
the
--
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes.
and
if
--
if
congress
had
meant
to
give
that
power,
it
would
have
spelled
it
out
instead
of
--
instead
of
--
actually,
what
appears
to
me
to
be
a
express
limitation
stating
that
at
any
district
where
it
might
have
been
brought
and
they
were
intending
to
spell
out
a
limitation.
in
the
norwood-kirkpatrick
case,
a
decision
of
this
court,
they
--
they
stated
with
approval,
the
ex
parte
collett
case.
and
in
that
case,
they
--
they
held
the
transfer
was
proper,
and
they
did
make
the
statement
in
effect
that
--
that
1404
(a)
had
broadened
the
discretionary
--
liberalized
the
discretionary
powers
to
be
exercised.
where
is
that
effect?
but
it
also
--
this
court
also
stated
and
i
quote,
“this
is
not
to
say
that
the
relevant
factors
have
changed
or
that
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
is
not
to
be
considered
but
only
that
the
discretion
to
be
exercised
is
broader.”
now,
one
of
those
relevant
factors,
we
submit
of
forum
non
conveniens
has
always
been
the
necessity
of
two
doctrine
--
two
forums
in
which
the
defendants
are
amenable
to
process
and
then
the
court
merely
had
the
choice
between
them.
and
that
that
is
one
of
the
factors
which
is
still
present
under
the
norwood-kirkpatrick
case.
with
respect
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decisions
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
and
--
and
petitioner
counsel.
we
submit
that
actually,
none
of
those
court
of
appeals'
decisions
in
first,
second,
third,
or
fifth
circuit
has
adopted
the
petitioner's
interpretation
with
--
with
the
exception
of
course
of
the
ex
parte
blaski
case
which
was
this
case
in
the
--
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit.
but
in
the
anthony
ver
--
kaufman
case
in
the
second
circuit,
the
in
re
josephson
case
in
the
first
circuit,
the
paramount
versus
rodney
case
in
the
third
circuit,
in
each
of
those
cases,
at
least
one
of
the
defendants
if
they
all
involved
a
plurality
of
defendants
and
in
each
of
those
cases,
at
least
one
of
those
defendants
could
have
been
sued
in
the
transferee
district.
so,
that
under
one
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it
could
have
been
brought
against
that
defendant
at
least
in
that
new
district.
then
the
other
defendants
could
have
come
in
and
joined
at
that
sir.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
none
of
them
--
none
--
none
of
them
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
none
of
them
held
on
that
basis.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
i
think
--
i
think
it's
--
in
a
couple
of
instances,
they
did
find
it
--
well,
yes
i
mean
the
court
has
specifically
found
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
in
the
paramount
case,
for
instance,
the
9
out
of
the
14
defendants
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
could
have
been
sued
in
the
--
in
the
new
mexico
district.
and
it
resided
as
a
fact
in
the
--
in
re
josephson
case
that
it
was
a
new
mexico
corporation,
the
transferee
district
and
the
--
the
three
directors
that
were
also
sued
were
--
were
in
massachusetts
court.
and
two
of
the
defendants
in
the
anthony
kaufman
case,
one
of
those
could
have
been
sued
in
the
transferee
district
and
the
other
defendant
was
the
holding
company
of
all
the
stock
of
--
of
the
defendant
that
was
in
the
transferee
district.
so
a
--
as
factual
matters,
the
court
stated
it
but
i
do
not
think
the
court
went
ahead
and
held
on
that
basis.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
and
in
--
as
for
torres
and
walsh
case,
that
was
admiralty
action
and
the
court
stated
there
again
as
a
fact
that
the
ship
had
been
in
and
out
of
puerto
rican
waters.
so,
the
action
could
have
been
brought
in
puerto
rico,
the
transferee
district.
in
the
other
hand,
if
it
is
to
be
considered
as
in
rem
action
with
the
raise
in
--
in
new
york
only,
then
we
submit
that
it
would
--
have
been
in
conflict
with
--
with
the
fettig
canning
company
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
188
f.2d
715
which
was
a
condemnation
case
transferred
from
the
district
court
in
missouri
on
food
stubs
to
indiana.
and
the
indiana
court
ordered
it
back
and
it
went
up
on
mandamus
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
they
upheld
the
indiana
court's
retransfer
order
stating
that
section
1404
(a)
provided
that
you
could
transfer
it
to
a
place
where
it
might
have
been
brought
and
that
the
food
stubs
that
were
in
the
--
involved
were
in
missouri.
now,
both
--
in
that
instance,
both
parties,
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
had
--
had
agreed
to
the
--
to
the
transfer
but
the
court
said
they
are
without
power
to
transfer
it
and
the
district
court
has
no
power
to
accept
it.
the
district
court
decisions
in
five
circuits
support
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case.
those
are
in
the
district
court,
decision
of
the
district
columbia,
the
second
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit,
the
eight
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit.
and
in
--
one
of
those
cases
--
also
for
petitioner
endeavors
to
distinguish
from
the
felchlin
v.
american
smelting
&
refining
company
case
at
page
2
of
it's
a
reply
brief
on
the
basis
that
--
in
that
case,
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
california
--
district
of
california
case.
in
that
case
that
the
executor
was
an
executor
in
california
and
would
--
wouldn't
have
had
power
in
the
texas
court,
the
transferee
court.
that
isn't
in
accordance
with
the
facts
stated
by
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
at
page
579.
there
he
said,
“defendant's
contend
that
before
an
executor
may
sue
in
the
texas
court
unless
timely
objection
is
made
and
that
in
the
instant
case,
the
defendants
have
waived
their
objection
by
filing
a
motion
to
transfer.”
so,
actually,
that
case
is
very,
very
analogous
to
this
situation.
the
--
and
--
the
only
difference
in
that
instance,
you
had
a
california
executor
involved
as
--
on
the
plaintiff's
side,
the
defendants
moved
to
transfer
it
to
texas
and
they
waived
venue.
and
the
defendant's
argument
was
that
well,
the
executor
could've
brought
it
down
in
texas
and
if
we
haven't
objected
to
it,
he
--
he
could
have
gone
again
with
the
--
with
the
case.
we
are
waiving
our
objection
and
therefore,
it
should
be
tried
there.
but
the
court
refused
it
and
in
doing
so,
he
pointed
out
that
this
was
a
question
of
power
and
that
section
1404
(a)
didn't
give
that
power
and
it
specifically
held
“the
phrase
might
have
been
brought,”
means
the
place
for
the
plaintiff
have
the
right
to
institute
a
suit
originally.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
orginially,
yes,
your
honor.
even
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
decision
in
the
blaski
case
and
this
case
admits
that
these
five
district
court
cases
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
then
in
five
--
i
mean
in
the
five
circuits
support
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case
and
refers
to
them
--
itself
--
at
page
11
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
that
appears
in
their
opinion.
and
another
of
the
district
court
decisions
supporting
the
respondents
here
is
the
decision
of
then
judge
whittaker,
now,
justice
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
of
this
court
in
the
general
electric
company
versus
transit
warehouse
company
case.
and
in
that
case,
judge
whittaker
in
a
very
carefully
reason,
the
logical
opinion
discussed
at
some
length,
the
words
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”
in
section
1404
(a).
and
in
ruling
on
a
motion
of
defendant
for
change
of
venue
and
in
that
case,
he
granted
the
motion
because
the
plaintiffs
had
pleaded
in
their
complaint
residents
of
the
--
of
the
defendant
in
the
transferee
district.
but
in
that
case,
judge
whittaker
carefully
pointed
out
that
--
that
no
meaning
is
left
to
the
words
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”
if
this
section
is
interpreted
to
require
a
trans
--
a
transferee
district
unless
it's
interpreted
to
require
a
transferee
district
in
which
statutory
venue
exist
and
service
of
process
and
involuntary
personal
jurisdiction
could
be
acquired.
judge
whittaker,
now
justice
whittaker,
in
that
case
also
agreed
with
the
dissenting
members
in
the
paramount
pictures
versus
rodney
case.
and
judge
hoffman,
the
petitioner
in
this
instance,
in
his
opinion
in
this
case,
also
stated
that
he
personally
--
he
agreed
and
i'd
like
to
read
from
his
opinion,
the
closing
part
--
toward
the
closing
under
his
opinion
there
which
appears
at
page
25
of
the
transcript
of
record
where
he
stated,
“gentlemen,
personally,
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
dissent
in
paramount
against
rodney
is
supported
by
the
greater
weight
of
reasons
and
logic
and
that
this
court,
if
i
were
to
rely
upon
my
own
personal
information
should
retransfer
this
case
to
texas.
those
cases
supporting
transfer
of
this
district,
i
think
do
great
violence
to
the
established
rules
of
statutory
construction.
they
seem
to
create
a
doctrine
of
retroactive
waiver
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
action
might
have
been
brought.”
now,
after
making
that
strong
statement,
judge
hoffman,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
then
proceeded
to
rule
to
the
contrary
on
and
put
it
on
the
basis
of
these
other
court
of
appeals
cases
which
we've
stated
--
which
in
our
opinion
can
be
distinguished.
and
also,
he
stated
that
he
--
he
felt
that
he
should
follow
the
law
as
it
appear
to
be
established
and
i
quote,
“especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
has
consistently
refused
to
grant
certiorari
in
those
cases
supporting
transfer
to
this
district.”
well,
of
course,
we
submit
that
judge
hoffman
clearly
was
in
error
in
giving
any
weight
whatsoever
to
the
fact
that
certiorari
was
denied
by
--
by
this
court
that
he
was
given
in
any
--
that
he
was
in
error
in
giving
any
weight
to
that
whatsoever
either
way.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
earlier,
you
asked
with
respect
to
question
of
whether
mandamus
was
a
proper
action
here
and
at
page
35
of
the
transcript,
the
court
or
appeals
stated,
“no
question
is
raised.
in
fact,
all
parties
concede
that
under
section
1651
mandamus
is
appropriate
means
for
testing
the
legality
of
the
order
in
controversy.”
further,
our
jurisdiction
if
there
be
any
doubt
is
supported
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
chicago
rock
island
versus
(inauidble).
and
with
respect
to
the
question
of
--
of
res
judicata
or
comity,
the
petitioner
himself
admits
that
--
at
page
16
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
he
says,
“i
am
of
the
opinion
that
this
court
may
--
may
so
inquire
that's
into
the
jurisdiction
of
transferring
and
accept
jurisdiction
and
that
the
doctrine
res
judicata
on
the
law
of
the
case
raise
no
barrier
to
such
an
inquiry.”
and
on
page

mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
it'll
take
me
a
few
more
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court.
if
the
court
please,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
requested
me
in
view
of
the
fact
of
the
--
of
the
shortness
of
his
time
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlanf's
question
of
yesterday
as
to
the
question
of
whether
a
waiver
was
included
by
the
defendants
in
the
motion
of
--
to
transfer
that
was
filed
in
texas.
and
the
answer
that
is,
that
there
was
such
a
motion
included
in
the
motion
--
such
a
waiver
included
in
the
motion
to
transfer.
of
course,
the
facts
has
--
have
not
ever
changed
the
defendants
as
far
as
it's
known
are
only
residents
of
texas.
they
--
that's
the
only
place
they
have
place
of
business
or
have
committed
acts
of
infringement
as
far
it's
known,
they
never
have
done
any
of
those
things
or
have
been
residents
of
illinois
even
up
today
as
far
as
it's
known.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
of
course,
it
was
argued
in
the
district
court
in
texas
as
to
whether
or
not
there
--
whether
it
was
in
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no,
no,
no.
that
is
the
only
place
the
defendant
is.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
he's
in
texas.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
the
defendant
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
first
you'll
have
to
understand,
sir.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
the
present
action
here
because
we
didn't
appeal
from
the
discretionary
part
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
we
thought
--
we
--
we
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
consider
that
to
be
fact
finding
and
therefore
we
didn't
appeal
from
that.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
we
don't
agree
with
it.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
no,
we
don't
agree
with
it
but
we
didn't
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
appeal
it.
but
there
was
contention
in
the
district
court
of
texas
that
it
could
be
brought
up
to
illinois
and
that
there
were
three
other
cases
involving
the
same
patents.
i
suppose
their
idea
was
consolidated.
how
in
the
world
it
can
never
be
consolidated?
i
don't
know.
the
parties
are
different,
the
--
the
structures
are
different.
the
only
thing
that's
the
same
is
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
is
the
patent.
yesterday,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
asked
opposing
counsel
if
there's
any
legislative
history
other
than
what
he
had
referred
to
that
was
pertinent
to
this
matter.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that,
of
course,
in
the
ex
parte
collett
decision,
the
court
discussed
at
some
length,
the
legislative
history
leading
up
to
the
adaption
of
section
1404
(a).
and
we
respectfully
submit
that,
in
that
decision,
it's
quite
clear
from
that
decision
that
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
special
venue
statutes
including
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
and
the
patent
statutes
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
footnote
29,
the
patent
statute
was
even
specifically
referred
to.
so
that
we
submit
that
when
congress
passed
section
1404
(a),
stating
that
an
action
may
be
transferred
to
a
district
where
it
might
have
been
brought,
that
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
intended
then,
that
you
also
consider
that,
together
with
the
patent
statute
which
they
definitely
recognize
to
be
there
and
which
states
that
an
action
may
be
brought
in
certain
specified
districts,
none
of
which,
would
qualify
in
this
case
as
being
in
illinois.
it's
limited
in
this
case
to
texas.
that's
the
only
proper
case,
the
place
where
the
plaintiff
could
have
brought
the
action
against
the
defendants.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
you
--
you
--
is
your
question,
has
this
court
decided
that?
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
oh,
i'm
sorry
to
say,
your
honor
i
don't
remember
this
court
having
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes.
i
don't
--
there
have
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes,
there
have
been
decisions
below,
i
--
i
think
both
ways.
some
courts
saying,
“well,
we
won't
do
it,
i
--
but
i
--
of
course
it
depends
on
the
facts.”
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
i
--
i
do
not
recall
at
the
moment
a
decision
of
this
court
on
that
point.
but
i
--
but
i
do
not
--
don't
mean
to
say
by
that,
that
there
isn't
such
a
decision.
i
just
do
not
recall.
also
yesterday
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
in
one
sense,
yes,
sir,
i
--
in
the
sense
that
the
patent
statute
specifically
provides
that
a
patent
infringement
action
may
be
brought
in
a
certain
district.
so
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
sir.
in
an
ordinary
diversity
of
citizenship
case,
of
course,
you
have
to
have
service
of
process
on
the
--
you
--
you
could
only
bring
the
action
against
that
person
in
a
district
where
you
could
get
service
of
process.
it's
somewhat
similar
in
the
patent
statute
case
except
that
it
is
even
more
emphatic
in
a
patent
statute
case
because
the
congress
has
specifically
provided
where
you
can
bring
a
patent
infringement
action.
in
a
few
cases
--
and
--
and
--
texas
is
--
is
the
only
case
here.
and
our
position
is
that
congress
certainly
didn't
mean
to
permit
the
defendant
to
force
a
plaintiff
into
an
improper
district.
it's
a
--
if
--
if
both
parties
agree
to
try
a
case
in
the
improper
district,
that's
one
thing.
but
congress
by
--
by
stating
that
it
may
be
transferred
to
a
district
court,
it
might
have
been
brought,
certainly
intended
that
to
be
read
in
--
in
a
patent
infringement
action
together
with
section
1400
(b)
in
the
patent
infringement
statute
which
states
that
it
may
be
brought
in
such
and
such
a
district.
and
the
only
district
that
would
qualify
in
this
case
is
texas.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes,
that
--
that's
one
point,
your
honor.
yesterday,
counsel
for
petitioner
stated
that
if
the
district
court
in
illinois
had
ordered
this
transferred
back
to
texas
that
the
clerk
couldn't
have
accepted
it
down
there
because
he
was
bound
by
his
court's
decision
and
it
would've
become
a
legal
sputnik
orbiting
between
the
two
districts.
well,
of
course,
i
submit
that
that
hasn't
any
basis.
if
it
have
been
transferred
back
down
to
texas
in
the
court,
in
the
district
clerk
or
the
court
had
refused
it
down
there,
well,
then,
of
course,
this
court
would've
taken
it
to
decide
that
issue
that
direct
conflict
between
them
as
to
which
it
was.
and
in
connection
with
that,
the
district
court
in
illinois,
we
submit,
is
it's
mandatory
under
the
law
that
a
court
inquire
into
its
jurisdiction.
if
parties
don't
raise
the
point
even,
if
the
court
has
reason
to
believe
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction,
it
--
it
must
raise
that
on
its
own
motion
sua
sponte,
but
it
--
so
it
was
incumbent
on
the
district
court
in
illinois
to
consider
whether
it
had
jurisdiction.
now,
if
the
--
if
the
texas
court
did
not
have
the
power
to
transfer
this
case
to
illinois,
then,
of
course,
the
illinois
court
couldn't
accept
it.
it
--
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
and
therefore,
it
was
mandatory
on
the
district
court
to
review
that
and
it
wasn't
bound
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
as
both
the
--
the
petitioner
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
seventh
case
--
seventh
circuit
have
specifically
found.
they
weren't
bound.
it
wasn't
res
judicata.
they
weren't
bound
by
comity
or
law
of
the
case,
i
don't
think.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
isn't
that
determining
jurisdiction
over
the
person
in
that
court?
here,
the
question
is,
did
illinois
have
jurisdiction?
and
i
believe
each
court
has
to
find
that
whether
or
not
it
has
jurisdiction
itself.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
--
in
its
opinion,
referred
to
the
case,
i
believe
it's
the
igoe
case.
it
is
--
it
is
in
the
opinion
and
it's
our
position
that
with
respect
to
this
--
it
might
be
possible
in
some
instances
but
--
but
with
respect
to
a
case
of
this
type,
i
think
it
--
it
isn't
only
the
thing
that
the
court
should
do,
i
think
it
is
mandatory
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
because
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
it
was
put
on
that
latter
basis
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
it
was
put
on
the
latter
basis.
i
--
i
cannot
recall
whether
they
specifically,
in
so
many
words,
said
that
it
might
have
been
brought
there.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
of
course
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
of
course,
sir,
it
could
have
done
it,
even
though
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
and
then
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
wrong,
it
could've
been
wrong
in
that
determination.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes,
but
our
court
of
appeals
had
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
--
said
that
they
adjudicated
it
improperly,
that
it
was
wrong.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well,
but
if
the
--
if
it
in
fact
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
entered
judgment
in
the
case,
it
would
be
my
feeling
that
the
--
that
the
judgment
--
any
judgment
that
would
enter
in
there
would
void
ab
initio.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
it
did
not
have
--
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
mr.
justice
whittaker
or
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
believe
it
was
asked
me
as
to
the
order
of
transfer
is
--
it
--
it
appears
on
page
8
of
the
transcript
and
is
--
i
don't
see
any
specific
mention
of
--
of
being
implied
or
might
have
been
brought.
of
course,
it
had
never
have
been
duly
heard.
the
court
hadn't
heard
the
argument
of
the
counsel
being
fully
advised
in
appearing
to
the
court
that
the
defense
motion
should
be
granted
for
the
grievance
of
the
party.
witnesses
didn't
suggest
it.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
well.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
power,
power,
yes.
power
was
argued.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
there
are
--
there's
just
one
more
thing
which
we
would
like
to
point
out
and
i
believe
it
illustrates
the
erroneousness
and
--
and
the
untenableness
of
the
position
for
counsel,
the
petitioner
in
this
--
counsel
for
the
petitioner
in
this
matter.
in
the
last
paragraph
in
the
reply
brief,
it
stated
it
is
s
not
however
petitioner's
purpose
to
perform
a
literary
autopsy
upon
the
section.
as
respondents
have
properly
pointed
out,
petitioner's
original
opinion
in
the
district
court
stated
that
on
a
pure
basis
of
literal
construction,
the
ambiguity
might
well
be
resolved
against
his
present
position.
petitioner
however
properly
resolve
the
ambiguity
in
accordance
with
the
appropriate
rules
of
statutory
construction
and
consistent
with
the
remedial
purpose
of
the
statute.
that,
we
submit,
is
in
conflict
with
what
the
petitioner
himself
stated
in
his
own
opinion.
in
that
opinion
--
in
the
opinion
at
--
at
page
25
of
the
transcript,
the
petitioner
stated,
“those
cases
supporting
transfer
to
this
district,
i
think,
do
great
violence
to
the
established
rules
of
statutory
construction.”
and
we
submit
that
petitioner's
own
statement,
in
his
opinion
in
this
case
shows
the
erroneousness
of
--
of
the
position
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner
that
this
is
in
--
in
accordance
with
--
with
the
proper
statutory
construction.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
i
am
not
absolutely
certain
now
that
this
is
correct.
but
i
believe
that
in
that
seventh
circuit
case,
there
was
a
mandamus
action
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeal
against
judge
igoe
and
it
involved
in
--
an
insurance
company
claim
and
i
believe
the
person
transferred
from
illinois
to
iowa
or
vice
versa.
and
it
was
a
question
that
came
up
under
section
1404
(a)
and
it
was
in
that
case
that
the
court
in
a
footnote
stated
that
under
section
1404
(a)
as
in
--
under
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
it
presupposed
to
jurisdictions
in
which
a
--
a
venue
was
--
the
defendant
was
amenable
to
--
to
process.
mr.
daniel
v.
o'keeffe
yes,
that
very
well
be,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i
have
trouble
recalling
it.
