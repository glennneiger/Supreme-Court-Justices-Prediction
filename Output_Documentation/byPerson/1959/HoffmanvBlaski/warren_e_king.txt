the
question
was
just
asked
as
to
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
enacting
section
1404
(a)
and
an
examination
of
the
status
of
litigation
in
the
period
when
section
--
section
1404
(a)
was
enacted,
might
shed
a
little
bit
of
light
on
that
question.
in
1947
and
1946,
the
house
judiciary
subcommittee
was
holding
hearings
on
--
with
reference
to
the
bringing
of
suits
against
railroads.
some
of
the
facts
that
were
brought
up
before
the
subcommittee
were
these.
for
example,
in
minnesota
at
one
time,
there
were
over
1000
personal
injury
cases
brought
in
the
state
courts
of
minnesota
by
nonresidents
--
nonresident
plaintiff
against
railroads.
and
some
of
the
railroads
didn't
even
have
lines
in
minnesota.
one
lawyer
in
chicago
filed
100
suits
within
a
period
of
one
year
against
the
southern
pacific
railroad
and
the
santa
fe
with
diamond
in
excess
of
$6
billion.
and
an
analysis
of
the
distance
from
chicago
to
the
site
of
the
accident
on
the
average
was
some
1930
miles.
the
average
accident
occurred
1930
miles
from
chicago.
between
1941
and
1946,
there
were
2500
suits
filed
in
the
district
court
other
than
the
district
in
which
the
accident
occurred
or
in
which
the
plaintiff
resided.
what
was
occurring
in
those
--
in
that
period
of
time
was,
in
personal
injury
cases,
primarily
in
suits
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
lawyers
would
get
these
cases
and
file
them
as
far
from
site
of
the
accident
is
possible.
an
action
happened
in
new
mexico,
they
filed
in
minnesota
or
in
chicago.
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
was
not
a
universally
accepted
doctrine
in
1946
and
1947.
in
an
article
in
the
california
law
review
by
edward
barrett,
professor
of
law
at
the
university
of
california,
he
states
that
the
doctrine
had
not
been
examined
and
just
passed
upon
by
most
of
the
states,
that
14
states
had
rejected
it
and
only
six
states
had
accepted
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
one
of
those
states
was
new
york,
in
which
it
was
a
statutory
right
given
to
the
court
to
transfer
if
the
court
felt
it
was
a
tort
action
brought
for
purpose
of
harassment
of
the
defendant.
the
earliest
case,
recognizing
the
doctrine
in
the
federal
courts
where
the
companion
cases
of
the
gulf
oil
company
and
the
lumberman's
mutual
case.
mr.
warren
e.
king
the
doctrine
originally
arose
in
scotland,
i
understand,
in
the
suits
between
nonresidents
and
it
was
first
adopted
in
this
country
where
there
were
nonresident
litigants
and
the
cause
of
action
had
arose
outside
of
the
country.
and
in
that
case
--
those
cases,
they
were
sent
back
to
their
respective
countries.
but
the
decisions
in
the
gulf
oil
company
case
and
the
lumberman's
case
indicated,
after
a
split
decision
of
five
to
four
that
they
should
be
--
the
doctrine
should
be
applied
only
in
exceptional
circumstances
or
the
use
of
the
word
“those
rare
cases”
where
the
doctrine
should
be
applied
and
it
was
not
generally
recognized
that
the
federal
courts
would
have
the
right
to
transfer
these
cases.
if
there
were
an
accident
case
that
happened
in
new
mexico,
filed
in
minnesota,
then
santa
fe
would
have
the
right
to
remove
the
case
to
the
federal
court
in
minnesota.
but
it
still
could
not
transfer
that
case
to
the
--
to
the
state
where
the
accident
occurred,
where
the
witnesses
were
located.
and
some
writers
have
indicated
that
the
purpose
of
the
enactment
of
section
1404
was
to
exact
the
remedy
of
this
situation
where
in
personal
injury
cases,
the
suits
were
brought
far
from
the
state
where
the
accident
occurred.
and
the
venue
statutes
of
the
various
states
and
under
the
employer's
liability
act
permits,
the
suits
to
be
brought
where
the
defendant
resides.
and
because
of
that
are
--
that
there
will
always
be
more
than
one
forum
in
these
railroad
cases.
these
railroad
lines
go
through
a
dozen
or
more
states.
and
if
the
suit
is
brought
in
minnesota
in
an
accident
happened
in
montana,
then
proper
venue
would
have
been
in
montana,
coexist
and
with
the
venue
in
minnesota.
and
section
1404
gave
the
federal
court
in
minnesota
the
power
to
transfer
it
to
a
--
the
forum
where
it
could
have
been
originally
brought.
and
i
believe
the
purpose
of
1404
was
to
actually
broaden,
thus,
the
doctrine
as
it
had
been
enunciated
in
the
two
cases
decided
by
this
court
where
they
used
the
word,
“the
exceptional
case,
exceptional
circumstances,
the
rare
instance”.
it
was
and
it's
so
that
the
court
has
a
bigger
leeway
in
transferring
cases
to
a
forum
where
the
suit
could
have
been
bought
in
--
in
the
beginning.
it
is
their
position
of
course
that
--
of
the
respondents
here
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
words
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”.
section
1391,
the
general
venue
section,
section
1400,
serving
venue
of
patents,
all
used
the
word
“may
bring”.
brought
is
the
past
tense
of
bring.
mr.
warren
e.
king
may
have
--
mr.
warren
e.
king
i
respectfully
submit,
it
is
not.
mr.
warren
e.
king
this
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
you
can't
--
mr.
warren
e.
king
1391?
mr.
warren
e.
king
that
is
correct.
but
it
does
not
make
it
a
proper
venue
in
the
first
place.
it
is
not
a
suit
--
a
state
as
none
--
mr.
warren
e.
king
section
1406
merely
states
that
failure
to
waive.
the
failure
to
raise
the
question
of
improper
venue
waives
improper
venue.
mr.
warren
e.
king
but
the
act
or
failure
to
act
of
the
defendant
to
object
to
venue,
under
section
1406
does
not
in
light
to
the
scope
of
1391
or
1400.
there
is
a
correct
and
an
incorrect
venue
under
1391.
suit
maybe
brought
in
this
jurisdiction
or
that
jurisdiction.
1406
merely
says,
if
you
bring
it
in
the
long
jurisdiction
and
the
defendant
does
not
object,
then
the
court
did
acquire
it.
mr.
warren
e.
king
that
maybe
the
result.
but
the
--
mr.
warren
e.
king
definitely
not,
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
king
the
chance
of
the
section
1404
is
the
past
(inaudible)
that
indicates
a
point
of
view
of
time
that
has
already
passed.
if
the
action
is
--
if
the
motion
to
transfer
is
under
the
present,
it
maybe
transferred.
but
the
conditions
or
the
--
the
conditions
covering
the
jurisdiction
to
which
it
maybe
transferred
are
those
--
are
referred
to
in
the
plural
perfect
tense.
something
that
has
occurred
in
the
past
and
it
is
now
no
longer
true.
may
or
--
may
or
may
not
be
true
any
longer.
but
it
must
have
occurred
at
the
time
--
it
must
have
been
true
at
the
time
the
suit
was
brought.
the
report
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
in
adoption
of
the
section,
1404
refers
to
the
--
the
b
&
o
versus
kepner.
there
was
the
case
were
an
action
have
occurred
in
ohio,
the
defendants
line,
mansfield,
ohio
and
yet
the
plaintiff
file
suit
in
new
york.
and
the
house
committee
report
says
that
the
1404
was
intended
to
remedy
situations
just
of
that
nature.
and
the
meaning
of
the
kepner
case
will
disclose
that
at
the
time
suit
was
filed
in
the
new
york
district,
it
could
have
been
filed
in
one
or
more
districts
in
ohio.
but
in
the
absence
of
1404,
the
cause
could
not
have
been
transferred
and
1404
was
enacted
to
permit
that
--
suits
of
that
nature
to
be
transferred
to
a
forum
were
it
could
have
been
brought
at
the
time
the
suit
was
originally
instituted.
the
position
of
course
of
the
respondent
is
that
there
no
ambiguity,
the
wording
is
clear
and
that
the
district
judge
--
petitioner
did
not
have
authority,
power
to
transfer
this
case
to
utah
where
the
suit
could
not
have
originally
been
brought
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
warren
e.
king
i
believe
that
that
would
be
true
if
suit
could
be
started
there
and
if
objection
were
not
made
to
venue,
then,
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction.
but
i
doubt
if
a
court
would
have
the
power
to
transfer
a
--
this
particular
action
to
montana
or
wyoming.
mr.
warren
e.
king
but
this
section
1404
was
enacted
after
long
hearings
by
the
house
--
judiciary
committee
where
the
statute
concerning
the
personal
injury
case
against
railroad
was
brought
into.
and
there
of
course,
venue
did
lay
in
many,
many
states.
thank
you,
your
honor.
