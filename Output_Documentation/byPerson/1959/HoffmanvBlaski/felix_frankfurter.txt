may
i
interrupt
you
--
may
i
interrupt
you
to
ask
for
that?
upon
the
denial
of
the
writ
for
the
fifth
circuit,
the
jurist
--
the
so
called
jurisdictional
point
was
raised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
raised
and
adjudicated
in
--
by
the
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
merriam,
may
i've
just
paid
for
you
--
gratefully
brief
really.
i
noticed
that
you
--
as
far
as
your
brief
is
concerned
of
merely
raising
the
direct
question
of
1404
and
all
these
were
--
and
all
these
came
here
in
a
--
in
a
situation
where
the
case
was
transferred
without
a
need
of
the
history
involved
in
this
case.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that
but
you
see
no
--
there's
no
--
you
don't
raise
any
question
as
to
the
facts
that
this
was
litigated
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
bowl
was
fixed
over
to
illinois
and
then
illinois
fixed
it
back.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
questions
that
--
that
that
involves
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
which
isn't
a
pure
1404
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
said
it
was
frivolous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
don't
think
it
raises
a
question
is
that
no
matter
what
one
thinks
about
1404,
well,
one
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
--
can
review
and
revive
and
reject
what
the
five
circuit
court
of
appeals
--
court
of
appeals
have
done.
you
don't
think
that
raises
a
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
judicial
administration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
can
say
that
(inaudible)
and
can't
be
foreclosed
by
your
view
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
--
may
i
interrupt
mr.
merriam?
was
the
matter
directly,
explicitly
involves
in
a
matter
of
josephson,
wasn't
--
to
give
them
recollection,
i'm
dreaded
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it
went
of
in
judge
magruder's
--
dealt
a
lot
with
power
to
deal
with
it
by
mandamus,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
question
that
was
discussed
at
length
and
which
is,
for
me
it
is
the
difficult
one,
in
josephson.
is
that
that's
all
involved
in
any
of
these
cases
whether
mandamus,
whether
you
can
review
in
the
forwarding
and
the
transferring
forth
or
whether
they
have
to
wait
to
the
transferring
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
is
it
implicitly
involved
in
any
of
these
three
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
a
little
confuse
--
conflict.
there
is
--
there
is
some
conflict
on
this,
in
the
lower
courts,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
matter
is
very
important
isn't
it
in
the
practical
litigation
whether
the
transfer
of
court
of
appeals
should
review
or
whether
you
have
to
wait
until
you
get
through
with
the
trial,
isn't
that
right
mr.
merriam?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
if
it
didn't,
is
it
--
is
it
implicitly
involved
in
any
of
these
cases
so
that
without
reaching
out
for
anything,
this
court
could
properly
test
on
it
or
should
properly
test
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
subject
which,
for
me
at
least,
especially
required
for
the
brief,
didn't
involve
this
philosophically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
--
i'm
sorry
for
interrupting
you
but
--
but
i
think
this
is
purely
the
case
where
interruption
may
serve
a
good
purpose.
has
the
matter
come
up
before
the
second
circuit
after
that
short
opinion
of
judge
frank
in
(inaudible)
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
has
that
become
the
--
has
that
become
the
rule
of
the
second
circuit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
circuit
has
--
has
been
happy
and
i
think
almost
indispensable
sent
to
a
practice
that
--
that
penalties
follow
each
other,
whether
they
like
it
so
far
as
first
penalties
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
what
is
practically
your
say
to
this,
mr.
merriam?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least,
they
don't
go
on
its
own?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
merriam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
pick
up
the
question
put
to
you
by
justice
whittaker
and
justice
harlan
and
phrase
it
a
little
differently.
but
to
me,
different
words
may
start
different
lines
of
thought.
i
don't
like
the
word
flexible.
to
me,
the
crucial
question,
the
starting
point
of
all
competing
consideration,
all
practical
consideration
in
a
filed
like
this
is
whether
the
words
where
the
suits
might
have
been
brought
may
fairly,
without
torturing
language,
be
an
ambiguous
collocation
of
words
be
a
doubtful
phraseology.
so,
as
to
put
this
one
construction
rather
another
and
that
flexible,
anything,
this
thing,
that
thing
over
with
those
words
of
terms
of
art,
namely
it
means
where
the
suit
might
have
been
brought
when
this
suit
was
brought.
and
one
has
to
determine
that
if
i
should
think
to
make
it
clear.
one
has
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
that
phrase
is
an
unambiguous
phrase
as
a
technical
confined
sense
in
meaning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
you
indicated.
flexible,
there
was
too
many
flexible
thought
in
my
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
--
wasn't
yours.
this
kept
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
--
that's
the
crux
of
--
from
there
you
go
on,
then
you
can
consider.
if
it's
doubt,
of
course
should
you
give
this
meaning
or
that
meaning?
and
for
the
resolution
of
that
doubt,
all
the
practice
of
considerations
come
in
but
you
can't
jump
that
hurdle
of
determining
whether
that
is
a
strictly
defying
technical
in
federal
jurisdiction
procedural
term
which
mean
the
allowable
venue
as
of
the
date
this
suit
was
filed
rather
than
as
of
the
time
that
the
judge
makes
up
his
--
decide
the
motion
to
transfer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
definitely
this
suit,
might
have
been
brought
in
the
--
and
cover
in
illinois
district
if
the
plaintiff
--
because
if
--
if
the
plaintiff
had
had
in
his
pocket
a
waiver
of
the
venue
requirement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
he
start
at
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that's
what
i
think
the
statute
means,
but
as
a
matter
of
english
words,
that
suit
might
have
been
brought
if
you
--
you
have
a
waiver
in
your
pocket,
he'd
have
a
waiver
in
his
pocket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
as
a
matter
of
english,
it
satisfies
those
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
answer
whether
he's
amenable
under
the
statute
or
whether
he's
amenable
in
--
under
the
fact.
under
the
statute,
if
there
is
no
venue
under
which
it
can
be
brought
to
chicago
or
the
transfer
district,
then
it
can't
be
brought.
but
the
--
the
words
don't
say
that.
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
what
i
think
that
concludes
the
matter
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
this
moment.
but
i
do
say
that
for
anyone
to
say
that
those
words
can't
be
interpreted
in
two
different
ways
as
a
matter
of
english
is
something
very
difficult
for
me
to
entertain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
got
a
waiver
in
your
pocket,
you
come
within
judge
hand's
rule.
but
there
are
two
forums
that
you
might
choose.
doesn't
follow
--
it
doesn't
follow
though
that
--
that's
different.
after
all,
you've
gone
this
far
mr.
merriam.
it
doesn't
follow
the
--
there
is
merely
one
meaning
to
be
attached
to
the
phrase
in
connection
with
all
the
--
the
other
venue
provisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
trying
to
prove
it's
ambiguous
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
desirability
of
your
result
and
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
have
to
prove
it
desirable.
it's
unambiguous
before
you
can
get
the
questions
of
desirability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
ambiguous,
then
you
open
the
field
to
follow
the
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
get
to
policy
consideration,
you
must
exclude
mr.
justice
whittaker's
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
risk
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
repetition,
what
is
the
legislative
history
that
justified
you
in
saying,
that
i
must
find
it
unambigu
--
ambiguous?
what
--
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
apart
from
the
geniality
about
doing
away
with
the
undesirable
result
of
the
gilbert
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
labor
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
those
--
those
--
when
is
--
what
--
what's
the
date
of
1404's
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1948.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you.
you
--
then
the
decisions
construing
it
came
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
pursuant
to
that
is
that,
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
see
how
that
helps.
i'd
like
that
checked
on
the
legislative
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thereafter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
amendment
are
proposed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see
now.
what
you're
saying
is
this
--
this
act
was
passed
in
--
what
we're
considering
is
came
out
with
the
code
in
1940
and
1948?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
under,
there
were
these
decisions
construing
it
and
then
came
these
proposals
which
you're
about
to
tell
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
practically
the
reenactment
of
the
kepner
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
shown
in
--
does
it
show
anymore
than
that
that
they
didn't
propose
to
recommend
the
adoption
of
that
proposal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
judicial
conference
committee,
this
conference
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
just
probably
words
where
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
they
set
forth
the
fourth
question.
you've
just
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
--
is
that
all
the
legislative
history
that
is
--
that's
relevant
to
our
consideration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
well,
you
say
the
legislative
history
that
we
had
said,
there
are
three
grounds
for
saying
this
is
ambiguous
which
allows
the
inflow
of
quality
consideration.
one
was
legislative
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
what
is
your
reasons
for
saying
it's
ambiguous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
on
the
intrinsic
deduction
from
the
word
ambiguity
derived,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
fit
this,
if
i
may
put
this
to
you.
assuming,
as
--
as
i've
indicated
my
agreement
with
you
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
meaning
by
that
that
there's
no
compulsive
content
to
those
words
requiring
that
if
he
read
the
meaning
that
assume
--
that
acton
might
have
been
brought
when
the
pending
action
was
brought.
assume,
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
then
when
you
come
to
policy
consideration,
i
put
to
you
two
possibilities.
one,
that
the
policy
consideration,
the
--
that
which
is
determined
by
the
whole
scheme,
by
the
general
scheme
of
venue,
namely
it
might
have
been.
or
that
the
policy
consideration,
what
vest
whether
it's
the
general
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
courts
of
an
entirety,
which
is
what
you're
arguing
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
the
former
is
--
is
--
well,
is
justice
--
or
not
just
as
because
one
makes
a
choice
but
the
former
--
the
perfectly
legitimate
point
of
view
from
which
to
consider,
how
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
once
you
grant
--
even
granting
the
ambiguity.
namely,
that
you
are
restricted.
you
confine
the
ambiguity.
assume
it's
ambiguous,
you
don't
reach
the
conclusion
that
it
means
whether
a
suit
might
have
been
brought
when
this
suit
was
brought,
rather
than
it
might
have
been
brought
when
the
judge
comes
to
pass
on
the
motion
for
transfer
because
of
its
general
conformity
in
a
nation
as
big
as
this,
with
the
territorial
limitations
and
the
other
considerations
that
define
and
confine
venue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
basis
on
which
so
called
justice
turns,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
the
general
theory
as
--
as
judge
hand
points
out,
limits
jurisdiction
of
courts
within
their
territory,
but
doesn't
that
--
have
to
travel
all
over
the
united
state
except
in
antitrust
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
argue
that
the
restriction
upon
the
court
of
finding
that
where
justice
has
done,
and
against
that
as
a
consideration
that
the
review
of
such
a
finding
is
extremely
limited
because
mandamus
doesn't
review
the
balance
of
consideration
for
this
fellow
as
having
his
trial
in
chicago
and
dallas
and
away
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
pressed
you
on
the
legislative
history
is
because
i
wonder
if
it's
--
there's
anymore
like
the
congress
gave
of
its
contention
in
the
words
you've
used.
the
answer
is
no
i
think
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
plaintiff
should
show
the
forums
though,
doesn't
he,
to
begin
with?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
isn't
limited
if
the
--
the
defendant
doesn't
stand
on
his
venue
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
and
i
don't
care
what
they
believe
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
he
is
not
limited
--
that
you
are
limited
if
the
defendant
doesn't
stand
on
his
venue
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
big
if,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
big
qualification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
that
you
could
send
it
to
any
court
in
the
united
states
is
really
a
--
well,
not
a
very
realistic
way
of
talking,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
settled
that
--
that
if
--
is
it
settled
that
if
the
plaintiff
--
because
i
am
ready
to
try
this
thing
at
some
other
places,
but
the
plaintiff
intends,
maybe
the
court
probably
to
send
it
to
some
other
cases
--
some
other
district
which
is
even
more
convenient
than
the
one
he'd
suggested.
is
that
been
settled
by
cases?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
defendant
--
all
i'm
saying,
that
the
defendant
then
didn't
--
didn't
waive
his
--
stood
on
his
venue
rights.
but
i'm
supposing
where
the
defendant
doesn't
stand
on
his
venue
rights
and
says,
“i
want
it
moved
to
chicago.”
is
there
any
case
which
says
that
judge
says,
“well,
you
now
don't
on
stand
on
the
limitation
of
the
suit
against
you.”
if
you
don't
do
that
--
the
plaintiff
says,
there
would
still
--
better
or
third
place
to
send
it
to.
is
there
any
case
which
says
that
can't
be
done?
i
think
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
when
the
defendant
resists
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
--
and
stands
back.
but
i'm
supposing
this
case
where
the
defendant
says,
“i
don't
stand
on
the
limitation
of
suit,”
namely,
which
restricts
suit
to
be
brought
in
texas.
“i'm
ready
to
waive
my
right
as
to
that
and
you
send
it
illinois.”
i
don't
know
what
i
will
decide
but
is
there
any
case
which
says
in
that
case
to
the
interest
of
justice
but
judge
can't
say
when
the
plaintiff
suggests
a
federal
third
alternative
as
to
this
would.
there
isn't
any
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
you
had
that
in
your
pocket,
a
letter
from
the
defendant
in
this
case
say
that
we
now,
you
can't
bring
us
into
court
in
--
in
chicago
or
illinois
but
we
hereby
authorize
you
to
file
this
commission,
specifically
waiving
the
venue
objection
we
might
raise.
before
you
begin
a
suit,
you
think
the
english
language
is
--
is
offended
by
saying
that
you
might
have
brought
that
suit
in
illinois,
and
put
the
waiver
in
your
pocket?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
take
my
case,
mr.
o'keeffe.
you
have
such
a
waiver
in
his
pocket
before
you
bring
the
suit.
you
then
bring
the
suit
in
texas
and
the
defendant,
present
petitioners
--
no,
the
present
petitioner
is
judge
hoffman.
and
the
defendant
in
that
suit
then
move
for
a
transfer
on
the
ground
that
you
might
have
been
--
might
have
brought
that
suit
in
illinois
before
you
file
it
in
texas.
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
--
would
there
be
any
offense
to
the
english
language
to
translate
the
--
those
terms
that
you
might
have
brought
that
suit
in
illinois
in
the
case
i
put
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
supposing.
by
that
time
you
say,
“i
want
to
bring
it
in
--
i
want
to
bring
it
in
--
in
texas.”
and
they
say,
“we
sent
you
a
letter
saying
that
we
are
ready
to
--
we
waive
our
venue
restriction
as
to
illinois.”
and
on
the
basis
of
that
they
move
the
texas
district
judge
to
transfer.
and
you
say
jurisdictionally,
he
has
no
power
to
transfer
because
the
suit
couldn't
have
been
brought
in
illinois.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case
--
i
know
that
in
this
case
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
my
--
that's
the
case
i
put
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
i
put
you
my
case
in
order
to
test
what
to
me
is
the
initial
question,
namely
“might
have
been
brought”
are
those
imprisoning
words
which
mean
--
what
do
they
mean?
do
they
mean
that
as
a
matter
of
venue
legislation,
it
could
only
have
been
brought
--
it
--
it
couldn't
be
brought
in
the
district
which
the
transfer
is
made.
and
i
put
you
to
the
case
of
advanced
waiver
which
would
have
led
you
to
be
able
to
bring
that
suit
in
illinois.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
think
if
i
taught
a
school
of
grammar
class
that
might
have
been
--
it's
not
used
with
exactly
$2
and
might
have
been,
might
mean
may
at
this
moment
be
--
i
have
to
be
a
bad
teacher?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
--
but
suppose
that
(inaudible)
was
brought,
the
defendants
(inaudible)
then
has
moved
for
the
transfer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
case
that
says
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
plaintiff
could
never
construe
(inaudible)
in
--
in
illinois.
if
this
is
a
jurisdictional
limitation,
then
the
court
wouldn't
grant
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
request
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
plaintiff
of
his
reference
would
originally
have
gone
(inaudible)
while
he
couldn't
thought
that
the
limitations
of
venue
statutes.
but
thereafter,
the
defendant
will
need
to
do
to
arrive
in
this.
that's
wouldn't
be
a
(inaudible)
upon
your
view,
the
courts
will
have
jurisdiction
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix

plaintiff
would
have
to
go
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suppose
in
determining
justice
in
the
district
courts,
district
courts
just
decide
as
to
the
problem
(inaudible)
straight
to
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
should
be
justice
abstract
in
equality.
that
doesn't
prove
that
this
might
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
a
great
(inaudible)
argument
of
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
was
then
to
take
it
home
for
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
problems
just
relating
for
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
know
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that's
the
rule
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
force
him
into
it.
you
don't
force
(inaudible)
unless
to
satisfy
the
requirement
that
justice
will
be
there
by
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
definition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
ground
of
the
district
court's
justification
for
transferring
it
to
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
that
question
of
you,
what
you
said
that
--
if
i
understand
what
you
said
just
now,
the
defendant
had
no
connection
at
all
(inaudible)
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
come
it's
the
other
way
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
only
place
where
--
where
he
really
has
the
footings
to
stay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so,
i'm
actually
at
the
point
of
why
the
district
judge
should
refer
him
further.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
just
trying
to
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
human
race.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
patent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
--
has
bearing
on
--
on
the
venue
legislation
pertaining
to
patents,
you
will
refresh
my
recollection
that
this
court
decided
that
--
isn't
it
decided
that
it
would
stay
an
action
in
a
district
in
which
a
patent
case
properly
and
perhaps
only
could
be
brought
in
order
to
await
the
determination
of
a
patent
decision
in
another
district
where
the
same
patent
had
been
issued?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
remember
--
i
think
i
wrote
the
opinion
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
bearing
--
has
bearing
on
the
--
on
the
relevance
of
--
as
it
were
in
(inaudible)
decision
on
the
patent,
i'm
using
the
loose
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
patent
has
come
up
below
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
we
have
it
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
view
of
the
specific
venue
provision
regarding
patent,
you
say
that's
an
a
fortiori
case
for
the
general
proposition
which
you're
advancing,
that
the
things
commerce
specifically
defined
where
a
patent
suit
may
be
brought,
the
generality
of
language
or
the
language
of
1404
is
not
to
make
inroads
on
that.
that's
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
is
that
so?
that
seems
to
be
obvious
to
--
you
indicate
isn't
obvious
to
me.
this
court
has
held
that
jurisdictional
determination
may
also
be
your
--
but
you
can't
go
behind
determination
regarding
jurisdiction
no
matter
how
wrong
a
court
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
--
a
self-determining
proposition.
that
if
a
court
of
appeals
makes
the
determination
on
jurisdiction
that
the
district
court
has
made
a
determination,
i
do
not
find
any
euclidean
proposition
or
anything
else
that
they
said
necessarily
that
it
isn't
--
isn't
a
foreclosable
decision
by
another
court
of
appeals.
well,
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
makes
it
mandatory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
says
the
decision
of
this
court,
it
will
make
it
mandatory.
but
i
see
is
that
--
what
was
that
case?
gottlieb
against
somebody
where
patently
none
on
the
merit,
a
jurisdictional
determination
was
made
that
couldn't
be
sustained.
but
having
been
made
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
i
don't
see
why
every
other
court
of
appeals
can,
on
its
own,
decide
what
it
will
do.
maybe
it's
so,
but
i
don't
understand
it,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
made
might've
--
that's
what
made
it
might
have
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
could
the
district
court
have
transferred
it
if
it
didn't
think
it
have
jurisdiction?
and
how
could
the
court
of
appeals
have
affirmed
what
the
district
court
did,
unless
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
had
jurisdiction?
the
court
can't
act
without
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
could
have
been
wrong
in
saying
it
had
jurisdiction
but
it
had
to
adjudicate
that
it
had
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is,
why
when
there
was
a
determination
by
a
court
of
appeals
of
a
jurisdictional
point,
because
unless
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction,
it
was
--
it
was
null
and
void
what
it
did.
it
might
have
been
wrong
but
it
wasn't
null
and
void
because
it
thought
it
did
have
jurisdiction.
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
its
claim
of
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
decide
that,
you'll
have
to
decide
that
the
determination
is
--
doesn't
foreclose
the
other
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
argued
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
didn't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
you
argue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
despite
that
argument,
it
entered
an
order.
but
if
that
order
doesn't
mean
that
it
--
it
found
that
you
did
have
jurisdiction,
i
don't
know
why
it
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
o'keeffe,
just
as
a
matter
of
interest,
you
might
like
to
look
at,
it's
not
bearing
on
this
case,
the
opinion
that
i
had
in
mind,
kerotest
manufacturing
company
against
c-o-two
fire
equipment,
342
u.s.
180
where
an
action
was
stayed
merely
because
the
validity
and
infringement
of
the
same
patent
was
going
on
in
another
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap).
i'm
just
--
i'm
just
curious,
that
was
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
butler,
did
i
understand
you
to
say,
that
if
there
is
a
change
of
residence
after
the
suit
has
been
commenced
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
another
venue
jurisdiction
that
the
plaintiff
could
move,
to
have
a
case
transferred
to
the
venue
district
of
the
defendant
if
that
is
the
venue
district
in
which
suit
could
have
been
brought
originally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
so
i
understood
you.
if
that
is
sought,
as
any
case
--
is
there
any
decision
in
which
the
1404
(a)
was
invoked
by
a
plaintiff
when
an
appropriate
occasion
in
your
point
of
view
had
arisen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
decided
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
case,
reported
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
--
are
they
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
they,
mr.
butler?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
raises
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
naturally
fittest
questions
whether
they
--
whether
this
is
only
a
one
way
street
as
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
be
grateful
to
you
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
give
me
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
reference
of
the
cases
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
was
an
admiralty
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
1404
itself
is
of
course
silent
regarding
the
moving
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
raises
the
question
that
we've
been
buried
back
and
forth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
added
a
minute
ago
to
--
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question.
assuming
the
availability
of
the
transferee
forum,
is
it
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
justice
black's
question.
i
may
have
misapprehended
it,
to
say
that
if
the
suit
--
if
a
suit
is
properly
instituted
in
the
transferor's
forum,
is
there
no
unquestionably
as
if
satisfying
all
the
venue
provisions.
but
then,
there
arises
the
only
additional
fact
that
it
would
be
more
just
to
bring
this
suit
in
another
district
in
which
suit
could
not
be
brought
under
the
venue
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
merely,
justice
can
mean
as
the
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
butler,
it
isn't
either
plaintiff
or
defendant
to
ask
whether
it
was
to
protect
either
plaintiff
or
defendant,
doesn't
exhaust
the
alternative.
this
is
a
statute
relating
to
the
functioning
of
the
federal
courts,
not
merely
the
--
the
the
interest
advantages
or
disadvantages
of
litigants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
there
was
an
earlier
opinion
by
justice
brandeis
in
280
of
--
referring
--
giving
the
whole
history
of
the
business.
the
doctrine
one
really
arose
in
connection
with
commercial
litigation
and
not
collision
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
all
those
sections
allow
suits
to
be
started
in
those
jurist
--
in
those
venue
districts
in
which
it
couldn't
be
brought
by
virtue
of
the
statute.
but
in
which
it
maybe
brought
if
the
defendant
waive
that
limitation,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
surprise
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
1404.
i
mean
all
the
other
provisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
13
--
all
of
the
other
--
all
the
other
venue
provisions
which
makes
specific
limitations
upon
the
court
to
entertain
a
suit
unless
the
provision
of
the
statute
is
satisfied.
that
limitation
is
lifted
if
the
defendants
--
because
i
have
no
objections.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
--
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
a
proper
venue.
and
certainly,
it
isn't
a
proper
venue
in
the
sense
that
you
could
have
brought
suit
there
if
there
had
been
no
waiver.
but
it
--
it
--
by
the
consent
of
the
party
in
part
if
you
will
by
that
kind
of
phrasing,
imparts
jurisdiction
in
a
court
which
by
statutes,
hasn't
got
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
therefore,
although
--
although
the
statute
which
the
limitation,
it
says,
maybe
brought
here,
must
be
brought
here.
all
those
subjective
--
subjunctive
limitations
are
wiped
out
if
the
defendant
affirmatively
says,
"i
have
no
objection.”
if
he
doesn't
raise
it,
which
means
it's
a
protection
for
the
defendant
and
not
something
that
circumscribes
the
court
as
a
matter
of
--
as
part
of
the
federal
judicial
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
merely
using
your
formal
words
instead
of
some
other
formal
words
and
say,
although
the
statute
defines
the
limitations
under
which
a
court
may
entertain
a
suit
if
the
defendant
objects.
if
he
doesn't
object,
the
court
may
answer
the
plaintiff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
1391
says
it
maybe
brought.
it
doesn't
say
if
the
defendant
waives
it.
it
says,
maybe
brought
here
and
that
is
right
into
to
it
because
of
the
nature
of
venue
in
protecting
the
defendant.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
outcome
has
to
be
one
way
or
the
other
and
saying
that
these
entomological
and
dramatical
or
syntactical
arguments
do
not
control
the
decision
in
this
case.
