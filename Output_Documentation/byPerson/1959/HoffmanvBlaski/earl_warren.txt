one

that

question?
do

concede
that
that
--
that
this
would
be
in

interest

chief

well,
i
know,
but
--
but
a
broad
--
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
itself.
do
they
concede
that
that
would
result
in
--
in
the
interest
of
justice?

mr.
butler,
you
may
proceed
with
you
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
defendant
have
moved
to
montana
instead
of
new
jersey,
would
the
--
would
the
court
have
transferred
to
montana
in
the
interest
of
justice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
question
arose
in
this
way,
suppose
it
arose
before
the
--
the
suit
was
filed
and
the
defendant
moved
to
montana
and
agreed
with
the
plaintiff
that
the
suit
could
be
filed
in
montana.
could
the
plaintiff
have
maintained
an
action
in
montana?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
--
even
though
the
statute
specified
the
forums,
the
only
forums
in
which
the
action
could
be
brought
in
montana
didn't
--
was
not
one
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
differentiate
this
case
then
from
the
one
that
preceded
you
in
that
regard?
there,
there
were
two
places
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
two
forums
in
which
the
--
the
action
could
be
brought,
one
was
texas,
one
was
illinois.
suppose
we
had
your
hypothetical
case
or
a
case
--
the
kind
of
case
that
they
had.
and
--
and
the
defendant
had
consented
to
be
--
be
sued
in
montana,
lets
say,
instead
of
illinois
or
--
or
texas
where
--
where
the
law
have
said,
it
could
only
be
sued.
could
they
then
maintain
the
suit
in
montana?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
to
get
back
to
my
question.
do
you
think
that
could
be
done?
