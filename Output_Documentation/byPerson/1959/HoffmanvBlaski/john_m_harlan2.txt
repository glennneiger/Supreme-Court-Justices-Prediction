justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
where
the
--
in
the
record
is
the
waiver
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
that
was
second
circuit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
second
--
is
the
seventh
circuit
decision
here
the
only
one
who's
gone
this
way?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
--
but
there's
--
the
seventh
circuit
as
a
circuit
is
alone
as
against
the
other
four
circuits?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
judge
learned
hand
has
gone
the
other
way,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
marshal
the
pros
and
cons
the
practicalities
of
litigants,
in
the
courts
of
the
two
positions?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
say
as
i
construe
it.
you
can
start
to
go
around
in
circle
on
this
thing.
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
as
far
as
the
limitations,
it
might
have
been
broader
concern.
that
is
flexible
enough
to
justify
an
interpretation
if
that's
a
sense
otherwise,
a
sensible
construction
of
the
statute
as
meaning
anywhere
where
the
parties
would
get
a
trial
as
of
the
time
of
the
transfer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
been
the
fact,
i'd
say.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
you
are
saying
--
and
counter
balancing
the
practicalities
as
you
might
call
them.
all
of
the
competing
considerations
can
be
taken
care
of
on
the
other
clause
in
the
statute
convenience
of
party
on
what
you
say.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
against
your
opinion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
--
is
that
clear?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
clear?
because
your
--
the
next
briefs
for
example
that
argue
the
question
on
that
point
a
little
more
fully.
they
say
that
under
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
the
test
was
as
to
another
forum.
the
test
was
as
to
the
--
at
the
time
of
transfer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
i
know
--
i
haven't
read
those
cases
yet,
but
is
that
so?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
would
be
under
it.
they
would
be
under
that
theory.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
would
be
two
proper
forums
under
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
under
the
--
the
forums
theory.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
opinions
in
those
cases
refer
to
that
section?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
in
your
position
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
suggesting
that
it
might
--
might
have
been
brought
to
the
--
should
be
interpreted
one
way
and
in
application
in
another
way
as
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
where
there's
no
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
do
you
think
congress
is
trying
to
protect
by
the
phrase
“might
have
been
brought,”
plaintiff
or
the
defendant?
so,
limitation
on
somebody,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
wherever
--
whenever
the
interest
of
justice
require
it
or
it
requires
it,
the
district
court
may
order
the
transfer
to
a
district
which
would
have
subject
matter
and
venue
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
venue.
who
is
it?
it's
--
congress
is
trying
to
protect
somebody.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
lot
of
words
--
