justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
what
the
statute
says?
isn't
that
what
the
statute
say
and
to
where
the
action
might
have
been
brought?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
duties
are
all
confined,
i
take
it
you
can
agree,
into
that,
are
they
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
prior
to
the
statute,
the
gulf
oil
case
held,
did
it
not?
that
where
the
rule
of
forum
non
conveniens
was
violated,
the
only
remedy
was
dismissal,
isn't
that
right?
there
could
be
no
transfer.
there
was
no
power
to
transfer
to
some
other
venue.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
this
forced
congress
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
adopt
this
for
lying
statute
1404.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
all
the
rights
of
transfer
that
a
district
court
acquires
are
in
that
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
i
knew
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
so
do
you
ascribe
any
meaning
to
the
six
words
where
the
action
might
have
been
brought?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
does
that
mean
that
the
action
might
be
transferred
to
any
place
to
the
country
where
the
defendant
is
willing
to
waive
venue
on
every
grounds?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
but
then
if
we
--
that
could
be
so,
then
the
case
maybe
transferred
to
any
place,
any
venue
in
the
entire
country
if
the
defendant
will
waive
a
new
and
then
their
appearance
there.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
say
yes.
but
now
then,
is
that
what
congress
said
in
your
view?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
statute
says
the
action
may
have
--
quite
have
been
brought,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
how
could
you
bring
an
action
under
the
rules?
simply
by
filing
a
complaint
to
the
office
of
the
clerk,
isn't
that
what
you
do?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
brings
an
action
that's
why
you
--
and
the
statute
says
that
any
action,
civil
action,
brought
in
the
federal
district
court
may
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
the
interest
of
justice
be
transferred
to
some
other
venue
where
the
action
might
have
been
brought.
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
that
to
mean
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
any
transfer
if
you
have
a
waiver
in
your
pocket.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
refer
to
ask
you
what
--
how
you
dispose
of
mr.
justice
learned
hand's
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand's
statement
of
--
to
complete
it
that
1404
presupposes
at
least
two
forums
in
which
the
defendant
is
amenable
to
processes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
--
do
you
think
i
added
something?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
problem
is
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
never
mind,
i
--
i
didn't
think
i
do.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
not
think,
if
i
may
ask
you
sir?
the
congress
in
adding
those
last
six
words
had
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
abuse
to
which
you
refer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
statute
(inaudible)
--
and
the
statute
(inaudible)
for
his
adversary
may
let
him
up,
isn't
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that
isn't
literally
right,
is
it?
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
does
suppose
at
least
two
venues
where
the
action
might
have
been
brought?
but
it
contemplates
no
transfer
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it
contemplates
if
this
action
be
brought
in
an
inconvenient
forum
that
it
be
dismissed,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
while
--
if
i
might
ask
you,
suppose
in
this
very
case,
the
plaintiffs
here
who
had
to
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
this
action
bring
it
in
texas,
no
residents
of
illinois
were
dissatisfied
with
that
forum
and
they
sought
a
transfer
under
1404
(a)
to
illinois.
could
they
have
--
could
the
court
have
made
that
order?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
plaintiffs.
the
plaintiffs
were
residents
of
illinois.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
right,
and
they
filed
the
suit
in
texas.
and
here,
it's
the
plaintiffs
that
moved
to
transfer.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
defendants
here
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright,
now,
but
then
i
assume
that
the
plaintiffs
themselves
moved
to
transfer
the
case
to
illinois.
the
plaintiffs,
they
had
to
file
it
in
texas,
didn't
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
now,
could
they
upon
a
showing
of
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses
and
in
the
interest
of
justice
have
obtained
the
valid
order
by
the
texas
court
transferring
the
case
to
chicago?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
the
action
couldn't
have
been
brought
in
illinois.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now,
they
can't
confer
jurisdiction
by
agreement.
what
they'd
have
to
do
is
dismiss
the
lawsuit
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
file
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
in
chicago
and
then
you
have
your
appearance.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
be
a
situation
done
of
bringing
a
suit
where
under
the
law
it
might
be
brought,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
the
plaintiff
cannot
transfer
this
case
from
texas
to
illinois
or
he
doesn't
like
the
venue,
but
he's
required
by
virtue
of
physical
facts
to
bring
it
there.
he
can't
transfer
it,
then
how
can
the
defendant
transfer
or
to
have
--
having
the
court
transfer
it
on
the
motion
of
the
defendant.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
isn't
just
(inaudible)
for
the
rules
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
way
of
recital
of
fact
of
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
o'keeffe,
may
i
ask
you,
sir?
did
the
texas
court
under
any
judgment
that
this
action
might
have
been
brought
in
illinois?
or
did
he
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
find
that
it
was
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses
that
it
be
transferred
to
illinois,
in
as
much,
and
could
be,
in
as
much
as
the
defendants
were
willing
to
waive
venue
and
interference
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
when
we're
talking
about
res
judicata,
we
have
to
look
to
see
what
was
the
thing
adjudicated.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
because
somebody
asked
them
to.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
how
you
can
assume
that
order?
do
you
believe
from
the
terms
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
why?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
the
--
another
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
precisely
what
it
said
--
what
it
said
that
--
that
this
transfer
might
and
should
be
made
to
some
other
venue
where
the
action
might
have
been
brought.
so,
it's
not
a
full
package
to
say,
we
treat
only
this,
the
convenience
of
the
parties
or
the
witnesses
to
the
interest
of
justice
because
there
is
a
further
limitation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
it
just
the
other
way?
[laughs]
as
far
as
1404
which
concern
venue.
a
statute
does
not
say
that
the
cause
maybe
transferred
to
some
other
forum
if
the
defendant
will
consent,
but
limits
the
power
of
the
court
to
make
the
transfer
to
a
venue
where
the
action
might
have
been
bought.
that
doesn't
involve
any
additions
or
if
the
defendant
will
waive
something,
does
it?
