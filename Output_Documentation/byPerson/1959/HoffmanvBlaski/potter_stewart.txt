there
had
been

an

mr.
king,
you
pointed
out
that
a
railroad,
typically
does
business
in
many,
many
states
and
that
the
basic
purpose
perhaps
was
to
enable
a
transfer
of
--
of
a
lawsuit
against
the
railroad
to
a
district
closer
or
to
the
district,
where
the
personal
injury
has
occurred
and
where
the
witness
is
presumably
are
available.
but
there
are
great
many
other
diversity
of
citizenship
cases,
and
many
of
them
are
negligence
cases
involving
automobile
accidents.
and
as
i
--
i'm
right,
am
i
not,
in
thinking
that
under
the
diversity
venue
statute,
the
plaintiff
is
limited
to
his
residence
or
that
of
the
defendant
under
general
diversity
under
the
enactment.
now,
it
said
certainly,
not
a
rare
or
very
hypothetical
case
to
have
an
automobile
accident
happen
fairly
far
from
the
residence
of
either
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant.
and
massachusetts
can
be
involved
in
a
collision
with
a
man
from
new
york,
both
--
and
they're
both
on
their
summer
vacation
in
wyoming.
and
yet,
under
your
interpretation
of
this
--
this
statute,
the
court
would
be
powerless,
would
it
not
to
--
to
transfer
an
--
an
action
even
though
both
--
both
of
the
parties
were
willing
to
the
district
where
the
actual
--
called
the
locus
of
the
actual
cause
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
where
--
where,
under
my
hypothetical
case,
all
the
witnesses,
all
the
eyewitnesses
were.
and
where
those
parties
would
like
to
see
it
transferred.
of
course,
as
you
point
out,
if
--
if
a
suit
where
brought
there,
and
there
were
no
objection
that
be
given.
