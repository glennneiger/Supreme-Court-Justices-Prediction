it
was
1954
or
1955
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
there
been
any
cases
where
a
defendant
who
was
properly
sued
in
one
district
moved
from
that
district
to
a
new
district
where
he
had
not
lived
before?
and
where
there
has
been
an
effort
made
to
change
the
venue
or
the
jurisdiction
to
that
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
defendant
did
move
his
residence,
would
you
think
he
could
then
have
--
make
a
motion
by
having
transferred
to
that
residence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
couldn't
have
been
brought
there
at
the
beginning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
in
your
--
that
--
that
could
cover
that
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
319
or
219?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
controlling
guide
in
there?
suppose
a
man
sues
a
company
that's
doing
business
in
a
certain
state.
and
that's
the
only
place
he
can
sue
it,
but
all
the
witnesses
or
somewhere
--
no
doubt
to
what
convenience
and
fairness
requires
of
the
case
be
tried
somewhere
else.
why
could
he
not
sue
him
there
in
that
place
where,
under
you
argument
--
where
he's
doing
business
and
then
go
into
the
court
and
say,
“i
had
to
sue
you
here,”
but
in
all
fairness,
injustice,
this
can
be
tried
only
at
this
other
state
and
ask
for
it
to
be
moved
there
under
the
federal
court,
could
he
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
that's
been
intimidated
several
times
because
i'm
--
i'm
just
wondering
what's
your
position
was
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
provided
they
could
get
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
such
court,
district
court,
anywhere
--
then
you
wouldn't
be
guided
at
all
by
whether
it
could
have
been
brought
in
the
beginning
or
could
be
brought
there
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
would
--
you
would
let
be
the
controlling
thing,
the
fairness
and
justice
of
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
do
you
--
you
do
give
it
that
much
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
give
it
that
much
effect,
why
don't
you
not
have
to
give
it
to
the
other
effect
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
in
the
improper
venue?
the
fairness
and
justice
of
the
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
if
you
are
right
in
saying,
if
the
question
is
decisive
as
whether
the
case
can
be
tried.
there
is
no
fairness
and
most
justice
if
that's
the
controlling
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
that
depends
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
think
you
see
something
could
go
beyond
the
wording
of
the
statute.
you
say
where
the
suit
could
have
been
brought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
saying
that
they
can
--
they
don't
have
to
accept
that
and
that
means,
where
it
could
be
brought
at
the
time
the
motion
is
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
argument
that
wherever
the
court
has
subject
matter,
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
lawsuits
therefore,
that
it
can
be
moved
to
that
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
seem
to
me,
let
you
close
it.
if
you're
going
to
put
it
that
way,
close
to
the
saying
that
the
suit
is
brought
at
the
place
where
the
person
is
doing
business
and
that
the
statute
authorize
it
to
be
transferred
to
a
place
where
he
is
not
doing
business,
if
fairness
and
justice
required
it.
now,
why
do
you
not
have
to
take
those
words
at
the
end
of
that
section
as
a
whole
or
reject
them
as
a
whole?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
--
but
the
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”
depends
on
when,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
frequently
--
frequently.
