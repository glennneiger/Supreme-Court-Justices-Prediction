ms.
bessie
margolin
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honor.
this
case
involves
the
section
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
discharge
or,
in
any
other
manner,
discriminate
against
any
employee
because
he
has
filed
a
complaint
instituted
a
cause
to
be
instituted
any
proceeding
under
or
related
to
the
act.
the
section
is
quoted
on
page
2
of
petitioner's
brief.
the
issue
is
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
court's
power
to
restrain
violations
of
this
section.
the
question
turns
on
the
meaning
of
the
jurisdictional
language
of
section
17
of
the
act,
which
is
also
quoted
on
pages
2
to
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
which
provides
that
the
district
courts
shall
have
jurisdiction
for
cause
shown
to
restrain
violations
of
section
15
as
a
proviso
in
--
to
that
section
which
i'll
show
yet
to
you
later
but
that
--
since
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeal's
decision,
i
will
defer
reference
to
that
until
after
meeting
the
grounds
on
which
the
decision
below
rested.
the
facts,
the
pertinent
facts
are
not
in
dispute
and
as
substantially
as
they
were
found
by
the
trial
court.
immediately
after
service
of
the
complaints
on
the
respondents
for
the
recovery
of
wages
due
some
named
employees,
respondent
and
respondents
who
are
the
demario
corporation
and
robert
demario
individually
who's
virtually
the
sole
owner
of
the
corporation
and
one
of
the
office
--
offices
of
the
corporation.
the
respondents
immediately
set
out
on
a
--
embarked
on
a
course
of
discrimination
against
the
employees
in
whose
name
these
complaints
were
filed.
and
by
changing
their
seating
arrangements
and
taunting
them
in
various
ways
and
assigning
them
less
desirable
work
and
other
things
of
that
nature
within
two
weeks,
all
three
of
the
employees
had
been
discharged.
the
trial
court
found
that
all
three
of
these
employees
were
relatively
long-term
employees.
two
of
them
in
particular
had
worked
continuously
for
respondents
longer
than
most,
if
not
all
the
other
employees.
there
have
never
been
any
complaints
about
their
work.
and
one
who
had
worked
the
--
continuously
for
respondents
for
over
three
years
were
admittedly
above
average.
and
the
trial
court
found
that
none
of
them
would
have
been
laid
off
had
it
not
been
for
the
filing
of
these
suits
or
--
or
if
they
have
been
laid
off,
they
would
long
since
had
been
reinstated.
the
trial
court
concluded
that
this
conduct
clearly
constituted
a
violation
of
section
15
(a)
3,
that
the
evidence
was
so
clear
and
convincing
that
the
secretary
was
entitled
to
an
injunction
to
restrain
respondents
from
discriminating
against
the
said
employees
and
also
to
a
mandatory
order
requiring
respondents
to
reinstate
them.
however,
the
court
declined
to
grant
the
secretary's
request
for
reimbursement
for
loss
of
wages
resulting
from
the
unlawful
discharges.
the
court
noted
that
the
question
of
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
to
order
such
reimbursement
had
been
raised
but
that
it
said
it
was
not
necessary
to
rule
on
that
question
because
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
it
would
--
it
would
decline
to
order
reimbursement.
but
it
made
no
--
no
findings
as
to
mitigating
circumstances
and
gave
no
reason
for
so
exercising
its
discretion.
the
secretary
appealed
from
the
denial
of
the
reimbursement
and
the
respondents
cross
appeal
from
the
order
for
reinstatement.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
sustaining
the
trial
court
in
both
respects,
holding
that
there
was
authority
to
order
reinstatement
but
that
there
was
no
corresponding
authority
to
order
reimbursement.
and
because
of
its
ruling
that
there
was
no
power,
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
unnecessary
to
reach
the
question
whether
the
trial
court
had
abused
its
discretion
in
declining
to
order
the
reimbursement.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
they
said
that
not
enough
of
it
had
been
printed
under
the
court's
rules
of
--
of
--
redesignated
only
the
findings
of
the
court
to
printing.
respondent
could
have
crossed
designated
and
didn't,
and
the
court
said,
“well,
if
they
had
to
reach
that
question,
they
--
they
can,
of
their
own
motion
in
that
court,
order
more
of
the
record
printed,”
so
they
--
they
didn't
reach
that
question
at
all.
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
the
case
probably
would
have
to
go
back
for
consideration
of
that
question.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
we
have
nothing
here
but
the
printed
record.
the
sole
question
here
is
whether
the
court
has
any
power
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
to
order.
the
fifth
circuit
explicitly
repudiated
the
second
circuit's
earlier
decision
in
1944
walling
v.
o'grady
where
the
second
circuit
had
held
that
the
reimbursement
power
was
a
necessary
power
adequately
to
carry
out
the
ex
prohibition
against
a
discriminatory
discharge.
the
fifth
circuit
reasoned
that
the
reimbursement
remedy
is
unavailable
unless
expressly
conferred
by
or
necessarily
implied
from
a
specific
congressional
enactment.
now,
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
o'grady
was
clearly
correct,
was
and
still
is
clearly
correct,
and
that
the
fifth
circuit
simply
ignored
the
legislative
purpose
of
this
statutory
prohibition
of
discrimination
and
ignored
also
our
--
applied
just
the
opposite
rule
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
statutory
construction
which
this
court
has
consistently
followed
in
construing
comparable
enforcement
provisions
of
other
regulatory
statutes.
the
principle
is
that
if
a
court's
equity
jurisdiction
is
invoked
to
restrain
violations
or
to
enforce
compliance
with
a
regulatory
statute,
its
inherent
equity
--
equitable
powers
are
available
to
effectuate
legislative
purposes
and
policy
unless
the
statute
expressly
or
by
necessary
inference
provides
otherwise.
now,
if
time
will
not
permit
going
in
to
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
various
distinctions
that
respondents
undertake
to
make
in
those
decisions,
porter
v.
warner
and
the
phelps
dodge
decision
of
course
are
the
ones
that
state
this
principle
most
explicitly.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
measure
damages
very
much
the
way
they
do
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
is
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
it's
not
--
it's
what
--
what
actual
loss
they
suffer.
in
other
words,
there
might
be
mitigation
of
damages
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
if
the
employees
had
secured
any
employment
in
the
interim.
i
think
some
of
them
--
one
of
them
at
least
did
secure
some
and
one
of
them
wouldn't
have
been
working
anyway.
another
one,
the
oldest
in
one
--
oldest
in
employment,
mrs.
duke
had
tried
for
the
full
year
to
get
employment
and
was
unable
to
get
any
employment.
and
they're
going
outside
of
the
printed
records
for
that,
but
i
don't
believe
it
will
be
denied
that
she
so
testified.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
law
isn't
very
clear
on
that.
the
court's
had
found
that
--
that
the
employees
do
not
--
certainly
don't
have
a
right
under
this
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
don't
think
the
law
is
too
clear
on
that
and
certainly
has
not
been
settled
that
this
gives
him
--
gives
him
any
such
right
because
all
the
decision
so
far,
most,
i
think,
except
for
one,
has
said
that
he
--
the
statute
does
not
give
him
such
right.
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
some
quite
--
there's
some
question
as
to
whether
he
has
the
right
at
common
law.
but,
apart
from
where
they're
not
--
the
employee
has
that
right,
we
think
that
the
--
has
ancillary
to
an
action
to
restrain
violations
of
this
section.
it
is
a
necessary
adjunct
to
the
restraining
of
any
such
violation.
and
certainly,
it
is
something
inherently
within
the
equity
powers
of
the
district
court's
unless
congress
has
explicitly
deprived
the
court
so.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
our
--
our
point
is
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
our
point
is
that
it
is
--
it
is
something
quite
different
from
that,
that
the
proviso
in
section
17
was
specifically
and
deliberately
limited
to
recovery
of
unpaid
wages
under
section
6
and
7
of
the
act.
and
that
the
reason
it
was
so
limited
was
because
simultaneously,
when
that
proviso
was
put
in,
in
1949,
simultaneously,
congress
enacted
section
16
(c)
of
the
act
which
gave
the
administrator
or
the
secretary
authority
to
sue
on
behalf
of
employees
for
unpaid
wages.
this
is
the
first
time
the
secretary
was
given
that
express
authority.
prior
thereto,
the
court's
had
held
that
the
secretary
could
recover
unpaid
wages
in
an
injunction
action.
congress
enacted
16
(c)
which
puts
certain
limitations
on
the
right
--
on
that
right.congress
said
he
could
bring
this
action
at
the
--
upon
the
written
request
of
the
employees,
only
on
written
request
and
only
if
there
was
no
unsettled
question
of
law
involved.
so
it
put
the
proviso
in
section
17
in
corresponding
language
obviously
with
the
intent
that
if
the
secretary
was
going
to
bring
action
on
behalf
of
employees
for
wages,
he
should
proceed
under
section
16
(c)
under
the
conditions
and
limitations
of
16
(c)
but
they
explicitly
recognized
that
he
could
bring
both
the
injunction
action
and
a
16
(c).
well,
16
(c)
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
prohibition
of
discriminatory
discharge.
there's
no
comparable
provision
in
the
act
giving
the
employee
a
right
to
sue
for
damages
under
a
loss
of
wages
due
to
discharge.
the
only
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
16
(b)
gives
the
employee
himself
a
right
to
sue
for
unpaid
wages
and
liquidated
damages.
ms.
bessie
margolin
he
could
have
sued
here,
he
could
--
he
could
sue
either
on
his
own
or
he
can
request
the
--
no,
he
couldn't
have
sued
here,
not
for
--
not
for
losses
due
to
discriminatory
discharge.
ms.
bessie
margolin
he
could
sue
for
his
unpaid
wages.
and
--
and
these
employees
decided
however
to
use
the
16
(c)
action.
ms.
bessie
margolin
as
i
say,
i
think
its
how
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no
statutory
action.
and
it
seems
to
be
questionable
whether
is
--
in
some
states,
at
least
whether
there
is
one
for
discriminatory
discharge.
it
certainly
is
not
clear
that
there
is
one.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right,
that
the
--
that
the
authority
to
restrain
violations
includes
the
authority
to
adopt
all
equitable
remedies
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
section
15
(a)
(3).
and
i
think
it's
important
that
we
look
to
that
purpose
because
i
think
that
certainly,
if
--
there
is
no
compelling
reason
given
either
by
the
court
below
or
by
respondents
for
interpreting
this
language
more
narrowly
than
the
anti-trust
act
is
--
is
interpreted
or
then
the
national
labor
relations
act.
there's
no
--
no
compelling
reason
for
doing
so.
and
there's
--
and
--and
therefore,
if
the
purpose
of
this
act
or
the
purpose
of
section
15
(a)
(3)
in
particular
depends
upon
this
type
of
remedy,
if
it's
to
be
all
meaningful,
and
we
think
it
does,
then
certainly,
doubts
ought
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
construing
it
with
the
same
flexibility
that
--
with
the
same
language
has
been
construed
under
the
anti-trust
laws.
and
therefore
i
would
like
to
direct
myself
to
the
purpose
of
this
15
(a)
(3).
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
would
never
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
fifth
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
circuit
said
that
was
never
good
law.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
they
specifically
refrained
from
my
--
i
think
it's
significant
that
neither
court
below
was
willing
to
rely
on
the
proviso.
and
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
that
it
was
expressly
and
in
terms
limited
to
suits
for
unpaid
wages,
and
that
it
didn't
in
terms
apply
to
this,
although
they
seem
to
think
that
--
they
inferred
in
the
intent
to
overrule
o'grady.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
i
think
that
the
--
the
purpose
is
really
conclusive
of
--
of
any
questions
about
the
interpretation
of
--
of
this
authority
to
order
reimbursement
because
the
purposes
obviously
to
protect
the
employees
against
discrimination
so
that
they
will
feel
free
to
make
complaints
and
cooperate
in
the
enforcement
of
this
act.
now,
their
cooperation
and
complaints
are
peculiarly
important
to
the
enforcement
of
this
--
of
this
act.
it
deals
with
the
minimum
labor
standards
of
over
20
million
employees
in
their
relationship
with
thousands
of
employers,
and
it's
obviously
wholly
impracticable
to
enforce
this
act
by
continuous
policing
of
employer
payrolls.
and
also,
the
enforcement,
general
enforcement
and
compliance
is
of
utmost
importance
to
its
effectiveness
because
of
the
highly
competitive
factors
that
are
involved.
therefore,
this
--
the
enforcement
of
this
act
depends
necessarily
upon
many
employees
feeling
free
to
report
any
information
they
have
or
any
complaints
they
have
about
violations
to
report
it
to
the
government
officials
and
feel
free
to
exercise
their
statutory
rights
to
sue
for
unpaid
wages.
unquestionably,
this
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
15
(a)
(3).
it
was
not
satisfied
simply
to
establish
procedures
for
enforcement
of
these
substantive
standards.
it
went
further
and
provided
that
employees
should
be
protected
and
encouraged
to
feel
free
to
participate
in
those
enforcement
procedures.
now,
what
happens
if
you
say
that
this
--
this
enforcement
--
for
enforcement
of
this
prohibition
does
not
include
the
power
to
order
reimbursements.
i
mean,
this
case
is
a
good
example.
three
employees
who
presume
to
exercise
their
--
their
rights
under
effect,
and
it
might
be
noted
in
this
record
that
the
employer
admitted
that
he
owed
this
money,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
criminal
charge
of
underpaying,
both
minimum
wage
over
time,
failing
to
keep
records,
and
these
specific
employees
were
among
those
named.
they
--
they
had
a
suit
brought
on
their
behalf
for
the
unpaid
wages
and
they
recovered
it
no
appeal
was
taken
from
the
judgment
in
their
affidavit
there.
so
they
were
asserting
unquestionably
rights
they
were
entitled
to,
and
they
presumed
to
assert
these
rights.
the
--
they
--
they
had
discharged
first
immediately,
almost
immediately
discharged
their
asserting
this
rights
in
the
plain
view
of
all
the
other
employees.
it
was
done
in
the
baldest
manner
obviously
for
the
purpose
of
intimidating
other
employees.
and
the
findings
of
the
court,
i
think,
will
indicate
that
they
are
out
of
work
for
indefinite
period
of
time.
the
order
of
reinstatement,
i
think,
was
about
a
year
later.
and
they
come
back
to
work
without
any
payment
for
the
loss
of
wages
during
the
many
months
that
they
were
out
of
work.
now,
the
employees
--
this
--
not
only
the
employees
who
were
discharged
but
their
fellow
workers
says
that
--
who
--
who
observed
all
this
happening,
who
among
any
of
them
is
going
to
feel
free
to
come
to
the
authorities
or
to
make
a
complaint
ever
in
the
future?
and
the
only
--
the
only
possible
way
that
--
that
this
section
can
be
given
any
meaning
is
if
the
employees
are
assured
that
they
will
not
only
be
reinstated
but
that
they'll
be
reimbursed
of
--
that
--
their
losses
and
will
be
redressed.
ms.
bessie
margolin
there
is
a
criminal
sanction.
the
criminal
sanction
applies
to
all
these
things.
we
had
just
had
a
criminal
action
against
this
employee
--
employer
for
his
other
violations.
the
section
7,
minimum
wage,
overtime
and
falsification
he
had
been
--
he
pleaded
guilty
to
that,
had
been
sentenced
in
and
affirmed
on
that
and
then
--
the
--
some
of
the
employees
decided
that
they
were
entitled
to
recover
these
wages
then
he
pleaded
guilty
of
failing
to
pay.
and
they
--
they
brought
this
--
this
action.
it
shows
how
little
by
the
way
that
the
criminal
action
deterred.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
that
is
true.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they're
quite
a
few.
ms.
bessie
margolin
probably.
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
you
mean
--
no,
there
are
very
few
cases
on
discrimination.
ms.
bessie
margolin
extreme
--
it's
--
it's
extremely
difficult
to
prove.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
no,
no,
it's
--
it
hasn't.
it's
been
withdrawn
because
some
--
some
other
remedy
was
given.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
the
secretary
can
enforce
it
on
his
behalf
too.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
yes
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
under
16
(c).
ms.
bessie
margolin
are
you
talking
about
unpaid
wages?
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
under
6
--
section
16
(c),
the
secretary
can
sue
on
behalf
of
the
employees
upon
their
written
request.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
the
point
i'm
making.
this
was
put
in
at
the
same
time
as
with
the
proviso
to
section
17.
and
they
were
obviously
intended
to
correspond.
they
didn't
want
--
they
didn't
want
the
secretary
doing
this
without
the
request
of
the
employee
but
it
gave
him
the
authority
under
section
16
(c),
took
it
away
from
--
from
them
in
section
17.
ms.
bessie
margolin
upon
--
no,
not
--
well,
he
can
--
he
has
discretion
whether
to
--
to
take
the
request
of
the
employee.
he
doesn't
have
to
accept
the
employee's
request.
ms.
bessie
margolin
a
request
is
required.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
those
cases
come
up
more
frequently
and
the
importance
of
the
anti-discrimination
provision,
of
course,
is
--
is
a
very
general
one
to
try
to
--
to
give
employees
general
feeling
of
security
about
his
asserting
their
right
and
to
enable
them
to
feel
free
to
assert
their
rights
to
sue
for
unpaid
wages.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
this
is
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
may
i
say
--
reserve
a
few
minutes
because
i
think
i'm
going
to
need
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
--
it's
a
public
interest
in
section
17
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it's
the
same
public
interest
that
was
involved,
i
think,
porter
v.
warner,
that's
involved
in
your
anti-trust
actions.
the
--
it's
the
interest
of
the
public
in
the
--
in
the
enforcement
of
the
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
now,
the
--
the
--
and
i
thought
that
i
would
be
certainly
amend
to
imply
that
the
--
the
purpose,
the
public
purpose
of
--
of
this
provision
against
discrimination
was
to
secure
the
cooperation
of
the
employee
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
in
the
enforcement
of
the
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
that
--
that
is
my
argument.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh
--
well,
i
was
looking
for
the
--
the
question.
i
--
apparently
i
didn't
make
myself
very
clear.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
that's
the
case
i
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
i
thought
i
wasn't
(inaudible).
ms.
bessie
margolin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
emphasis
on
the
individual
rights
of
the
employees
may
have
been
overdone.
we're
not
concerned
here
merely
or
even
particularly
with
the
reimbursement
of
specific
employee.
we're
concerned
with
the
public
interest
in
the
sharing
employees
that
they
will
not
suffer
financial
economic
loss
if
they
cooperate
in
the
enforcement
of
this
act.
that
the
act
depends
necessarily
on
their
cooperation
and
that
if
employees
learn
or
think,
if
they
will,
if
the
decision
below
remains
enforced
that
they
cannot
be
protected
from
loss
of
wages
for
an
indefinite
period.
that
they
cannot
be
protected
and
get
redress
for
that,
they
are
certainly
not
going
to
have
much
assurance
under
section
15
(a)
(3)
that
they
are
free
to
come
in
and
complain
or
to
file
claims.
and
it's
--
it
just
become
--
well,
become
apparent
to
him
that
that's
--
protection,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
our
investigators
refer
to
that
when
they
--
when
they
are
interviewed,
and
we
take
their
complaints.
that
they
will
--
they
will
be
protected
against
discrimination
and
against
loss.
well,
if
they
are
not
given
redress
for
their
wage
losses,
then
that
protection
is
just
illusory
because
it's
commonplace
knowledge
that
an
employee
is
just
as
much
intimidated
and
deterred
from
cooperating
with
enforcement
officers
by
the
fact
that
he
may
lose
his
wages
for
an
indefinite
period,
as
he
is
by
the
fact
that
he
may
permanently
lose
his
job.
and
the
thing
that
--
the
public
interest
here
is
quite
something
--
quite
apart
from
the
private
right
of
the
employees.
we're
interested
in
the
reimbursement
of
the
individual
employees
because
it
means
that
that
is
the
only
way
the
public
interest
can
be
protected.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
you
can
completely
disregard
that.
i
think
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
we're
--
the
--
the
statute
--
this
court
has
had
frequent
occasion
to
comment
on
the
intimidatory
influence
inherent
in
the
employment
relationship,
particularly
for
the
low
wage
employees
with
which
this
act
is
--
is
primarily
concerned.
and
what
congress
was
obviously
interested
in,
in
enacting
this
15
(a)
(3),
was
to
give
the
employee
some
assurance
that
they
were
not
going
to
suffer
economic
loss
by
making
their
claims
under
this
act.
that
they
were
not
to
--
they
were
not
to
submit
to
substandard
labor
conditions
in
fear
of
losing
their
job
and
in
losing
their
pay.
and
the
loss
of
their
pay
is
obviously
just
as
serious
to
them
as
the
loss
of
their
job.
to
reinstate
them
without
redress
for
the
wages
they've
lost,
is
to
just
thwart
the
whole
purpose
of
this
section
15
(a)
(3)
provision.
it
did
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
comparable
to
the
discrimination
provisions
of
the
labor
board
act.
and
it
--
and
under
that
act,
the
courts
have
always
recognized
that
reimbursement
for
loss
of
wages
was
--
was
the
--
the
normal
method
of
--
of
enforcing
that
provision.
now,
with
respect
to
the
labors
law
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
well,
i
was
going
to
come
to
that,
that
statute
is
explicit
of
course.
but
the
decisions
under
it
and
in
particular,
the
phelps
dodge
decision
says
specifically
--
explicitly
that
that
remedy
would
exist
even
if
there
were
no
congressional
mandate.
and
porter
v.
warner
under
the
price
control
act
says
that.
and
the
fact
that
it
would
exist,
i
think,
is
demonstrated
by
the
antitrust
cases
where
the
language
is
--
virtually
the
same,
as
to
prevent
and
restrain
violation.
and
this
court
significantly
has
used
virtually
the
same
language
in
describing
the
authority
under
the
antitrust
cases
as
it
has
under
the
labor
board
cases.
now,
we
think
the
--
the
reason
for
the
specificity
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
because
there,
you
have
enforcement
by
a
board
created
by
statute
with
only
the
right
that
the
congress
gives
them,
whereas,
under
our
statute,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
antitrust
law,
you
--
congress
has
put
the
enforcement
in
the
hands
of
courts
of
equity,
who
already
possessed
these
powers.
and
the
cases
under
railway
labor
act,
the
court
--
this
court
and
--
and
other
courts
have
recognized
that
even
without
a
provision
to
restrain
violations,
back
pay
could
be
awarded
for
violation
of
the
policies
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
and
the
rights
outstanding.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
don't
think
anything
was
said
about
monetary
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
don't
recall
anything
specifically
said.
i
think
the
purpose
is
obvious.
i
think
that
there's
much
more
reason
to
have
this
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
enforced
only
by
--
by
the
public
official
rather
than
by
employee.
the
wages,
so
far
as
the
minimum
wages
and
overtime
are
concerned,
that
can
be
easily
calculated
and
to
give
each
employee
a
right,
it
can
--
they
can
sue
for
it
more
easily.
it's
more
--
it's
more
clear
what
to
do
them
and
would
be
for
violation
of
--
of
this
type
of
provision.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
practically.
ms.
bessie
margolin
may
i
--
i'll
just
add
one
other
point
about
the
criminal
sanctions.
the
--
of
--
of
course,
there
are
criminal
sanctions
for
this
as
well.
but
there
was
also
the
injunctive
remedy,
and
i
think
there
is
a
good
reason
for
making
both
available
there.
if
criminal
sanction
is
not
adequate
to
assure
an
employee
that
he's
going
to
be
protected
if
he
talks
to
the
government
because
it
--
it
--
the
fact
that
the
state
may
collect
the
fine
from
their
employer
is
--
is
not
going
to
give
them
any
assurance
that
they're
protected
or
--
or
believe
them
of
the
intimadory
effect
of
--
of
losing
their
wages.
the
--
the
fine
in
this
case
so
far
--
other
violations
didn't
deter
the
employer
here
from
firing
them.
and
the
employees
coming
back
without
redress
for
their
lost
wages
and
all
the
other
employees
seeing
them
was
obvious
to
them
what
--
what's
going
to
happen
if
they,
in
the
future,
decide
to
assert
their
claims,
only
the
most
courageous,
if
not
full
hearty
employee
after
learning
that,
is
gong
to
take
advantage
of
his
--
of
section
15
(a)
(3).
