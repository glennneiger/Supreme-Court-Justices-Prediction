mr.
lamar
r.
moore
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
a
court
of
equity
does
not
have
the
power
under
this
statute
to
grant
damages
or
discharge
or
as
we
have
referred
to
it
generally
back
wages
ancillary
to
the
power
to
restrain
violations
of
the
fair
legal
standards
act.
now,
we
must
find
this
power
on
the
language
of
the
act
or
we
must
find
it
generally
resting
within
the
inherent
powers
of
equity.
the
government
here,
i
believe
i'm
correct
in
saying,
is
relying
upon
the
traditional
inherent
powers
of
equity
in
order
to
get
this
relief
under
this
act
and
reimburse
an
employee
for
money
lost
between
the
time
of
discharge
and
the
time
of
reinstatement
under
an
injunction.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
well,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
i
believe
legally
they
are
in
--
are
resting
upon
the
inherent
power
of
equity
to
grant
this
damages
for
--
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
this
act.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
i
think
that
equity,
your
honor,
can
take
complete
charge
of
any
situation
whereas
jurisdiction
attaches
and
can
give
complete
relief.
however,
the
relief
it
gives
must
be
based
upon
some
right
or
some
law.
it
cannot
step
outside
of
the
general
or
specific
law
in
order
to
give
extraordinary
relief.
now,
the
scope
and
breadth
of
equities
decrees
is
one
thing
but
its
power
to
decree
is
another.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
its
power
to
decree.
in
other
words,
under
the
anti-trust
laws,
for
example,
which
they
had
used
as
an
analogy
in
this
case,
the
anti-trust
act
is
general
in
terms,
prohibiting
combinations
and
giving
powers
to
the
courts
to
prohibit,
to
enjoin
or
otherwise
prohibit
those
combinations.
the
court
of
equity
in
taking
charge
of
an
anti-trust
case
has
a
broad
scope
within
which
it
can
act
in
order
to
prohibit
a
culmination
or
a
contract.
and
so
anything
that
must
be
done
in
order
to
do
that
is
authorized
by
the
general
terms
of
that
act
but
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
right
in
an
employee.
we
--
we
are
maintaining,
the
respondent
is
maintaining
here
that
there
must
be
a
right
upon
which
equity
can
face
a
decree
to
grant
back
wages.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
that
is
the
fact.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
that's
correct.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
that's
correct.
we
maintain
that
the
court
cannot
go
so
far
as
to
enforce
an
individual
right
not
authorized
by
the
statute
in
order
to
vindicate
public
policy.
that
--
that
remedy
would,
in
its
nature,
be
punitive.
and
being
punitive,
a
court
of
equity
will
not
reach
that
far.
we
have
studied
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
cases
upon
--
the
basic
cases
upon
which
the
--
the
later
cases
rely
for
the
powers
of
equity,
these
inherent
powers
of
equity.
we
find
no
right
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
for
an
individual
to
receive
damages
for
discharge.
and
we
believe
that
it
is
universally
the
law
that
there
is
no
common
law
right
in
an
employee
to
receive
damages
for
discharge.
now,
that
is
true
where
there
is
no
contract
for
a
term
of
employment.
now,
where
there
is
a
contract
for
a
term
of
employment,
i
have
a
contract
for
six
months
or
a
year
and
i
am
discharged,
i
can
sue
for
damages.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
no,
sir.
i
don't
see
how.
there's
no
authorization
for
any
such
--
any
such
cause
of
action.
the
cause
of
action
in
the
secretary
here
is
his
devout
with
written
permission
from
the
employee
to
sue
for
unpaid
minimum
and
all
the
time
wages
actually
worked
for.
it
has
no
relationship
to
the
damages
for
being
discharged
discriminatorily.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
they
--
they
have
absolutely
no
remedy
individually
in
themselves
and
that
there
is
no
specific
authorization
in
this
act
or
any
other
act
for
the
secretary
to
move
in
their
behalf
for
damages
for
discharge.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
there
is
no
remedy.
mr.
lamar
r.
moore
yes,
sir,
i
maintain
that
outside
of
authority
to
substantiate
that,
your
honor.
there
--
there
is
no
right
an
employer
has
a
--
has
a
right
to
discharge
an
employee.
now,
it
is
only
under
the
legislation
such
as
we
have
here
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
where
congress
has
gone
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
right
and
given
an
employee
the
right
not
to
be
discharged
because
of
certain
discriminations,
one,
say,
for
union
activity,
or
the
other
here
for
suing
for
his
rights
under
this
specific
act.
