was
he
lawfully
discharged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
if
he
was
unlawfully
discharged,
can
you
rely
on
the
contract,
permit
an
unlawful
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
i
understood
you
said
contract
at
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
precisely.
first,
his
employment
at
will
and
there's
no
law
which
gives
him
--
which
says
that
(inaudible)
having
a
right
to
employ
at
will,
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
you
can't
decide
one
for
this
reason,
you
got
to
keep
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
difficulty.
you
have
here
more
than
an
employment
at
will.
you
have
an
employment,
do
you
not,
in
which
your
law
has
said,
you
got
to
keep
it,
unless
--
insofar
as
the
right
to
discharge
him
to
--
but
because
he
files
a
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
is
what
the
statute
says
is
the
remedy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
maybe
i'm
wrong
when
it
comes
to
the
common
law
that
you
rely
on
the
contract
at
will
or
any
other
time
it
may
--
its
(inaudible)
one
of
it
is
in
terms
speaking
in
the
language
of
the
law
is
incorporated
here
if
the
law
said
that
it
has
to
be
there
that
you
can't
break
this
contract
for
this
reason.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i
saying
when
i
thought
many
courts,
you
took
as
the
common
law,
i
thought
that
it's
been
a
rather
general
common
law
rule,
am
i
wrong
in
that
sense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
would
limit
the
state,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
depends
on
the
construction
of
the
statute
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
it
with
reference
to
the
common
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
phelps
dodge
case
pose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
say
that
it's
necessarily
means
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

minimum
wage
or
does
he
have
a
contract
that
--
what
--
what
he
get
is
so
much
per
hour
or
something
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
minimum
wages
protected
by
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
assume
that
if
that's
the
case,
assuming
damages
(inaudible)
based
on
the
wages
