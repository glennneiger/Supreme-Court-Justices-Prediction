mr.

it's
your
position
then
that
either
statutorily
or
under
the
common
law,
the
--
that
these
employees
have
no
remedy
at
all
for
this
discharge.
chief
justice
earl

kind
of
flow
from

from
this
prohibition
in
the

chief

is
there
criminal
sanction
for

mr.
moore,
where
--
where
in
(inaudible)
is
the
riparian
right
of
the
lower
acts
on
the
plan
materially
different
from
the
right
that
the
employee
has
here
by
statute,
not
to
be
interfered
with
discriminatorily?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
let's
take
it
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
in
language,
it
does,
but
doesn't
it
say
that
he
has
a
right
to
remain
employed
in
his
position
to
the
extent
the
he
shall
not
be
discriminated
against
by
reason
of
his
exercising
his
rights
under
these
statutes
and
why
isn't
that
right
that
he
attains
similar
to
the
one
that
the
riparian
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
doesn't
the
right
--
doesn't
the
right
to
not
to
be
discharged
because
of
that
discrimination
arise
from
that
statute?
