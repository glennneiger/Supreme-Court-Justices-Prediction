would
you
agree
that
--
would
you
agree
that
it
is
right
in
not
relying
on
the
proviso
since
an
argument
could
be
made,
i
think,
either
they
approved
it
that
it
implies
the
power
theretofore
existed
was
cut
down
or
that
the
power
--
etcetera,
do
you
agree
with
that,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
to
go
back
in
the
situation
where
the
second
circuit
began
and
where
this
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
or
perhaps
i'd
rather
let
you
go
out
and
state
the
purpose.
that
may
answer
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
margolin,
i
don't
--
for
myself,
i
don't
think
you
can
solve
this
problem
by
producing
this
particular
case
of
dramatic
mischief.
i
don't
think
from
that
you
can
draw
the
necessary
guard
principle
which
is
involved
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
question.
the
issues
of
the
unpaid
minimum
wages
or
unpaid
overtime
compensation,
are
they
few
or
many
in
the
enforcement
of
this
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
quite
a
few
considerably.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
it
made
to
discrimination,
are
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
few
cases
of
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
the
result
of
fourth
--
of
the
1949
amendment,
and
i'm
not
drawing
--
as
i
have
indicated,
i'm
not
construing
the
--
the
court
of
equity
from
the
implication
of
the
1949
amendment
but
the
result
of
the
1949
amendment
is
that
in
the
many
instances
where
equity
--
that
the
power
of
equity
to
also
impose
damages
as
withdrawn
into
the
few
instances
that
it
remained,
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
remedy
that
you
--
that
was
given,
you
indicate
is
--
is
not
a
good
remedy
because
that
puts
the
burden
on
the
employee
to
enforce
his
right
not
in
the
secretary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
statute
say
so?
the
statute
doesn't
say
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
unpaid
overtime
compensation
and
unpaid
minimum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
he
can't
do
it
on
his
own
determination
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
he
--
a
request
is
required,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
--
so
that
the
power
of
the
secretary
is
more
limited
with
reference
to
the
larger
class
of
compensation
to
be
sued
for
than
in
the
case
before
the
court,
that's
true
in
effect,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
drawing
any
inferences
against
you
or
for
you.
i'm
just
trying
to
see
the
basis
on
which
this
can
rest
in
the
general
purpose
of
the
statute
for
the
protection
of
employee
is,
for
me,
not
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
its
so
likely
important,
then
you'd
expect
greater
explicitness
and
particularly,
the
withdraw
even
though
a
new
power
is
given
a
more
limited
power
seems
to
me
to
make
inroads
on
the
general
idea,
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this,
section
17
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
the
chief
justice
will
take
it
out
of
my
time
instead
of
yours.
[laughter]
section
17
gives
the
power
of
the
secretary
of
--
of
labor
to
bring
injunction
proceedings,
what
i
want
to
know
in
the
first
place
is
that
power
vested
in
him
to
enforce
a
private
light
or
a
public
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
my
next
question
--
my
next
question
is,
if
your
going
to
draw
--
rely
on,
because
i
think
you
must,
for
the
injunctive
power
in
the
secretary,
you
must
also
rely,
i
think,
on
derivative
powers
in
the
secretary
to
enforce
not
individually
this
for
the
public
interest.
now,
what
i
ask
you,
if
you
will
spell
out
what
the
public
interest
is
in
giving
in,
authorizing
and
drawing
the
general
power
of
the
court
of
equity
to
impose
without
specific
statutory
authorization
the
imposition
of
money
damages
although
to
other
powers
given
to
the
court
of
equity
except
that
it
should
exercise
equity
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
interest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
understand
the
public
interest
not
having
discrimination.
that
goes
for
the
whole
mechanism,
the
whole
social
function
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
union
rights
etcetera,
etcetera
but
we're
dealing
here
with
a
very
specific
claim,
namely,
that
as
an
adjunct
or
as
an
auxiliary
to
the
public
interest
in
getting
an
injunction,
there
is
also
impliedly
the
public
interest
in
a
chancellor
to
enforce
normal
equity
powers
to
wit,
it's
the
only
way
to
remedy,
it's
the
way
to
remedy
fully
the
public
interest.
it
is
necessary
to
get
some
money
--
to
impose
money
damages
that
is
a
concomitant
of
the
chancellor's
power.
and
that's
what
you
really
have
to
risk
on.
you
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
trying
to
agree
with
you
but
you
wouldn't
let
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is,
to
me,
a
difference
whether
--
whether
there's
an
implied
authorization
of
the
secretary
of
labor
to
sue
for
money
damages
for
the
employee
or
the
friend
of
the
employee
or
the
--
what
--
what
is
now
given
by
$16.
that
is
a
different
thing
from
saying
independent
of
what
is
the
interest
of
the
employee
having
his
$27
or
$127
is
the
interest
of
a
public
which
is
the
--
the
procedure
is
different
from
the
monetary
individual
interest
of
the
employee.
that's
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
the
power
to
grant
--
once
--
once
jurisdiction
is
given
to
enjoin
which
is
the
most
conventional
of
all
equity
powers,
the
government's
argument
is
that
there
is
a
right
from
that
to
enjoin
effectively
to
remedy
the
--
the
mischief
and
to
that
end,
it
may
be
necessary
and
not
merely
say,
“don't
do
this
hereafter
but
also
make
good
for
the
loss
you
have
committed.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
its
power
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
clash,
that's
why
i
took
some
minutes
of
ms.
margolin's
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
clash
between
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you're
right,
then
this
is
an
enforcement
of
a
right
of
an
individual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
secretary
of
labor
is
not
enforcing
the
right
of
an
individual
alone.
he's
also
enforcing
the
right
of
a
public
interest
although
that
right
may
involve
denial
of
what
is
owing
to
a
lot
of
individuals,
and
they
are
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
position
that
if
i
challenge
all
the
cases
in
this
equity
in
addition
to
enjoinment,
conduct
or
commanding
the
conduct,
also
--
most
of
the
defendants
were
damaging,
everyone
will
indicate
and
will
disclose
the
damage
--
that
the
damaged
part
of
it
could
have
been
(inaudible)
common
law
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
any
doubt
--
i
haven't
any
doubt,
but
you
can
find
though
that
many
of
the
cases
wouldn't
be
true
that
instead
of
remitting
the
--
the
equity
remitting
the
plaintiff,
the
law
in
order
to
--
to
avoid
and
acquire
his
damages,
money
damages,
that
they're
greeted
all
up
in
one
--
one
proceeding.
but
the
fact
that
in
those
--
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
money
damages
could,
by
an
undetermined
cause
of
action,
draws
in
law,
i
do
not
think
it
establishes
as
such
that
if
carrying
out
that
for
which
the
extraordinary
remedies
because
in
all
that's
said
and
done,
equity
is
still
is
an
extraordinary
remedy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
except
for
a
statute
looks
otherwise,
to
question
one's
exercise.
well,
equity
puts
the
affirmative
or
coercive
power
of
the
state
behind
the
cessation
of
evil
conduct
or
compelling
good
conduct,
and
there
are
collateral
damages
in
society
that
we
can
also
say
what
you
must
make
good,
that
monetary
damage
we
do
not
have
to
sit
in
exaggeration
to
(inaudible)
or
substantively
determine
whether
you
could
bring
a
cause
of
action
for
money
damages
on
the
law
outside
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong,
am
i
bad
guesser
if
i
guess,
i
thought
it
is,
the
very
few
statutes
that
confer
injunctive
remedies
injunctive
jurisdiction
upon
a
court,
explicitly
add
and
in
such
a
proceeding,
money
damages
may
also
be
held.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
want
to
forget
that
very
few
statutes
are
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
supposing
your
dam
case,
which
are
frequent
cases,
suppose
in
your
dam
case,
the
attorney
general
of
a
state
is
authorized
explicitly
by
a
statute
to
enjoin
or
continue
it
for
that
nuisance
and
suppose
because
of
that
nuisance
hundreds
of
workmen
were
thrown
out
of
work
and
put
on
public
relief
though,
what
was
states
relief
whatever
you
call
it,
you
would
say
that
the
attorney
general
in
that
proceeding
enjoined
the
systems
for
continuing
for
the
nuisance
could
--
could
not
also
ask
the
reimbursement
of
the
state
of
what
culpably
has
been
or
demonstrably
can
be
shown
to
--
in
view
in
the
--
the
draft
on
the
treasury
itself,
$6000
or
whatever
it
is,
x
dollars,
which
they
have
to
pay
for
putting
those
(inaudible)
on
social
relief,
but
typical
entirely
to
the
conduct
found
to
the
--
of
public
nuisance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
you
would
say
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
the
statute
--
if
it
has
the
view
--
not
to
spell
it
out
but
authorized
the
collection
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
would
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
make
clear
that
the
state
is
directly
not
derivatively
out
of
(inaudible)
because
of
this
nuisance
which
is
now
enjoined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
completely
disregard
inquiring
to
whether
or
not
the
employees
have
independent
common
law
rights?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
said
either
in
the
report
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
a
report
that
brought
in
and
deal
with
(inaudible)
act
or
in
the
statement
by
the
sponsors
of
the
(inaudible)
on
the
floor
of
either
house,
bearing
on
monetary
compensation
or
consequences
of
discriminatory
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
said
--
was
anything
he
said
that
they
talked
about
important
--
putting
this
thing
under
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
injunction
with
remedies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
i
was
wondering
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
is
they
build
on
conventional
establishments
about
the
power
--
the
--
the
consequences
of
granting
an
injunction
with
an
injunction
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
such
as
the
common
place
remedy
which
include
this
--
what
you
regard
as
a
common
place
implication.
