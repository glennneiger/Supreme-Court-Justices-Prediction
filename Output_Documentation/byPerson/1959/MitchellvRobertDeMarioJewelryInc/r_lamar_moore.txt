mr.
r.
lamar
moore
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reiterate
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
there
is
no
right
in
the
employee
and
no
right
in
the
administrator
under
this
statute
or
under
the
common
law
that
justifies,
legally,
damages
for
discharge.
i
would
like
to
be
emphatic
about
this
point,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
there
is
no
common
law
right
to
damages
or
in
an
employee
for
mere
discharge
where
--
where
those
damages
arise
is
when
a
contract
is
breached,
a
contract
of
employment
but
a
mere
day-to-day
employment.
being
discharged
from
that
would
not
give
a
cause
of
action
because
the
employer
has
a
--
an
inherent
right
to
discharge
any
employee
in
the
absence
of
contract.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
under
the
common
law,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
such
right.
the
case
that
is
cited,
which
is
a
georgia
case,
involved
a
discharge
of
a
railroad
employee
where
they
actually
went
out
and
accused
him
of
not
doing
his
work
properly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
sued
for
slander
and
sued
for
damages
for
wages
for
having
been
discharged.
the
court
stated
that
regardless
of
the
reason,
for
any
reason
that
was
in
the
employer's
mind
they
could
discharge
that
employee.
now,
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
while
it
is
made
unlawful
to
discriminate
against
an
employee
for
the
reason
stated
in
this
act,
there
is
no
right
given
to
the
employee
to
any
damages
because
of
the
breach
of
that
legal
duty
to
the
public.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
by
this
statute.
and
i
don't
think
that
one
arises
that
common
law
merely
because
it
is
made
unlawful
under
this
statute,
because
this
statute
carries
with
it
and
--
and
must
spell
out
the
rights
which
it
gives
to
the
government,
to
the
employer
and
to
the
employees
and
in
the
absence,
it
is
our
position
that
in
the
absence
of
spelling
out
those
rights,
those
rights
do
not
exist.
in
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
criminal
sanctions
provided
in
the
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
the
criminal
sanctions
apply
to
all
of
the
various
provisions
of
section
15
of
the
act
which
are
to
transport
goods
in
commerce
in
violation
of
the
act
to
discharge
or
in
any
matter
discriminate
against
an
employee,
the
child
labor
provisions
and
the
record
keeping
provisions,
though
these
criminal
sanctions
apply
to
that
section.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
cases
--
basic
cases
relied
upon,
there
are
two
cases,
i
have
cited
one
and
the
--
the
secretary
has
cited
one.
the
case
that
they
cite
which
is
cited
and
approved
by
the
case
of
porter
against
warner
involving
the
emergency
price
control
act,
that
case
is
clocked
against
smith
which
is
an
old
case
involving
the
title
to
land
in
kentucky
and
tennessee.
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
a
federal
court,
acting
in
equity,
could
grant
a
remedy
which
was
provided
for
in
--
under
state
law.
the
courts
--
the
court
found
that
the
title
to
the
land
actually
was
in
the
plaintiff,
but
the
circuit
court
divided
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court,
acting
in
equity,
could
grant
the
relief
required
by
the
state
statute
and
the
supreme
court,
this
court,
held
that
equity
could
enforce
that
right.
the
man
was
entitled
to
have
the
junior
--
the
junior
deeds
or
junior
patents
to
the
land
granted
by
the
state,
delivered
into
court
and
cancelled.
now,
that
is
a
right
upon
which
equity
could
act,
but
where
no
right
exists
now
as
in
the
case
of
peter
against
hargrave,
an
old
virginia
case,
pre-civil
war
case,
where
some
slaves
sued
for
their
freedom
under
the
will
of
one
hargrave
and
acquired
their
freedom
by
virtue
of
that
will.
they
sue
--
they
asked
for
an
additional
decree
for
the
mean
profits
of
their
labor
in
the
interim
from
the
time
that
the
will
was
probated
until
they
were
released
by
the
administrator,
who
had
been
procrastinating
and
vacillating
and
delaying
the
matter,
and
they
asked
for
the
profits
of
their
labor.
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
legal
right
to
the
profits
of
that
labor
and
consequently,
equity
in
mandatorily
giving
them
their
freedom,
could
not
grant
damages.
now,
those
two
cases
are
old
cases,
but
they
are
the
cases
or
--
or
a
type
of
case,
which
point
out
the
distinction
where
equity
acts
on
legal
rights,
follows
the
law
and
does
not
go
out
and
make
new
writs
and
grant
extraordinary
--
well,
it
grants
extraordinary
relief,
but
it
does
not
grant
new
relief
which
has
not
heretofore
been
sanctioned
at
common
law
or
under
a
statute.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
yes.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
the
respondent
disagrees
with
that
position,
your
honor,
in
this
that
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
a
loss,
does
not
necessarily
give
rise
to
damages
and
where
there
is
a
vindication
of
the
public
policy
and
no
statutory
basis
for
a
granting
of
damages
of
that
sort,
equity
now,
acting
as
equity,
does
not
step
in
with
punitive
measures
of
that
sort.
it
--
it
does
not
go
to
vindicate
public
policy
in
--
in
--
by
--
by
way
of
righting,
say,
a
private
wrong,
where
no
remedy
exist
for
that
wrong.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
they
--
they
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
think
you're
correct
but
--
but
i
think
where
--
where
equity
acts,
for
example,
if
--
if
add
them
up
a
stream
and
affect
your
riparian
rights
and
your
cattle
pairs
to
them,
you
can
come
in
to
equity
and
enjoin
me
from
blocking
the
water
and
at
the
same
time,
because
equity
takes
charge
and
gives
complete
relief,
you
can
get
damages
for
the
tort
done
to
you
by
interference
with
your
right,
but
you
do
have
a
riparian
right.
here,
the
employee
has
no
right
because
of
discharge,
discriminatory
or
otherwise.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
for
damages
to
the
state.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
would
say
that
unless
the
statute
spells
out
that
there
are
damages
to
the
state,
your
honor,
i
would
say
no.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
that's
correct.
unless
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
yes,
now
--
now,
i
would
say
this
that
if
they
could
join
with
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
those
persons
damaged
not
--
not
because
they
received
relief
from
the
state,
but
by
--
by
the
interference
with
a
riparian
right
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
think
that's
correct
that
it
is
not.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
at
--
at
common
law,
of
course.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
under
the
statute
here?
well,
this
statute,
of
course,
changed
the
common
law
to
--
to
this
extent
in
regard
to
discharge.
first
of
all,
it
created
a
right
in
an
employee
to
receive
a
certain
minimum
wage,
which
he
did
not
previously
have
so
that
was
created
and
different
from
the
common
law
right
which
--
which
only
gave
him
what
he
contracted
to
receive.
now,
in
--
in
doing
so,
this
statute
is
somewhat
self-contained,
in
--
in
doing
so,
it
provided
further
that
if,
in
enforcing
this
right
to
minimum
wages,
this
employee
is
discriminated
against
for
that
reason,
then
the
court
can
come
in
and
enjoin
the
--
the
discrimination
and
the
--
the
employee
can
sue
on
his
own
behalf
or
the
secretary
with
his
written
permission
for
him
can
sue
for
the
unpaid
minimum
and
overtime
wages.
but,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
act.
it
doesn't
go
that
far
to
create
a
right
to
damages
for
having
been
discharged,
it
stopped
short
of
that.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
--
i
don't
believe
the
statute
says
exactly
that.
now,
it
--
of
course,
the
court
may
interpret
it
to
say
that,
but
the
court
says
in
--
i
mean
the
statute
says
in
effect,
“thou
shalt
not
discriminatorily
discharge.”
it
doesn't
say
that
the
employee
has
a
right
to
any
wages
for
--
or
--
or
damages
for
discriminatory
discharge
and
it
--
and
it
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
sir,
i
--
i
do
not
--
oh,
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
in
--
in
the
statute
in
going
further
and
saying
to
the
court,
“you
can
restrain
this
discrimination,
this
violation,”
gives
him
the
right,
perhaps,
to
be
put
back
to
work
under
a
mandatory
injunction
which
the
federal
court
is
entitled
to
issue.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
means
that
the
court
can
go
further
and
grant
him
any
other
right
than
that
because
it
spells
no
right
in
him,
it's
a
prohibition
against
the
employee,
i
mean
the
employer,
rather
than
a
right
granted
to
the
employee.
now,
there
are
rights
granted
to
the
employee,
and
they
are
specifically
spelled
out
in
the
act,
and
they
are
--
that
he
can
get
certain
minimal
overtime
that
he
has
worked
for
and
has
not
been
paid,
but
the
statute
just
stopped
short
of
creating
this
right.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
was
he
lawfully
discharged?
the
court
held
that
he
was
unlawfully
discharged.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
don't
think
--
well,
there's
no
contract,
your
honor,
unless
you
could
construe
a
contract
from
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
well
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
an
employment
at
will.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
but
under
the
common
law,
there
--
there
is
no
right
to
damages
for
discharge
for
any
reason
under
an
at
will
contract.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
but
the
remedy
provided
for
the
statute
is
merely
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
--
is
--
is
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
it
is
statute
as
to
the
remedy
says
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
restrain
these
violations.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
and
--
with
criminal
sanctions,
that's
correct.
those
are
two
different
sections,
of
course.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
your
position
being,
your
honor,
that
the
contract
having
been
made
in
the
light
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
incorporates
this
in
it.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
think
that
contracts
are
made
with
reference
to
the
general
laws
of
the
state.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
nevertheless
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
well,
the
state
--
the
--
the
government.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
yes.
but
--but
of
course,
these
contracts
of
employment
actually
were
made
under
the
state
--
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia.
that
was
--
that's
the
--
the
body
of
law
that
would
govern
the
contracts,
except
where
they
are
affected
by
federal
law.
now,
it
is
my
position
though
that
this
act
is
limited
in
its
scope
and
the
fact
that
it
--
it
maybe
unlawful
as
against
the
employer
who
maybe
criminally
prosecuted
for
violation
of
the
provision
of
the
law
just
as
i
may
be
criminally
prosecuted
for
speeding
on
the
highway
that
that
does
not
create
any
right,
contractual,
legal
or
otherwise,
to
any
damages
in
that
employee
because
the
court
--
i
mean
the
--
the
statute
does
not
contain
that
right
and
the
only
remedy
provided
for
discriminatory
discharge
is
that
the
courts
can
restrain
violations
of
this
act
and
of
the
four
or
five
things
that
the
act
prohibits.
those
things
are
directed
against
the
employer.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
well,
yes,
i
do
and
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
well,
i
think
it
--
of
course,
depends
upon
both.
i
think
that
the
statute
must
be
construed
in
the
light
of
its
--
of
course,
its
legislative
history
the
--
the
language
particularly,
the
language
used
in
it
and
particularly
the
omissions
of
language.
the
labor
department
depends
a
great
deal
on
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
brings
in
the
--
the
power
of
the
board
to
take
affirmative
action
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
now,
that
language
is
not
--
is
not
found
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
there
is
--
there
is
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
an
illustrative
as
--
as
an
--
an
example
illustrating
the
affirmative
action
they
can
take.
that
they
can
reinstate
with
back
wages.
now,
unless
congress
had
thought
that
that
was
a
departure
from
the
normal
accepted
law,
that
illustrative
example
probably
would
not
have
been
inserted
in
that
act
to
take
affirmative
action
including
the
reinstatement
with
back
pay
as
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
this
act.
that's
the
broad
sweeping
language
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
was
the
original.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
now,
the
phelps
dodge
case
held
that
under
but
--
that
language
and
coupling
that
with
the
definition
of
the
word
“employee”
who
did
not
have
to
be
the
employer's
employee,
the
one
involved
--
the
employer
involved
here,
and
coupled
also
with
the
interpretation
of
the
word
“ha”,
discrimination
in
regard
to
“ha”,
they
held
that
they
had
to
instate
employees
who
were
refused
employment
because
of
union
activity.
and
there
is
ample
basis
in
that
statute
for
that
holding
without
going
into
and
gleaning
out
of
the
general
statement
of
policy
the
right
to
do
that.
now,
the
--
the
--
these
two
acts
compared
will
show
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
deals
with
a
much
more
elusive
subject
matter,
a
much
--
a
subject
matter
of
much
broader
scope
and
more
complicated
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
board
was
created
to
handle
and
administer
this
act,
whereas
here,
the
matter
is
comparatively
simple,
and
it's
not
as
complicated
of
administration
as
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
passed
after
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
significantly,
the
language
to
take
affirmative
action
including
reinstatement
with
back
pay
was
not
used
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
congress
had
before
it,
the
full
language
of
the
wagner
act
at
that
time.
and
i
feel
fairly
confident
that
that
language
was
employed
in
the
beginning
of
the
wagner
act.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
well,
i
think
this,
your
honor.
i
think
that
can
be
construed.
that
proviso
which
says
that
in
and
in
proceeding
by
the
administrative
foreign
injunction
to
restrain
violations
that
the
court
shall
not
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
unpaid
minimum
and
overtime
wages
and
liquidated
damages,
i
think
that
this
back
pay,
if
there
is
any
right
to
such
back
pay,
which
would
be
damages
for
discharge,
if
that
exists
and
of
course,
that
would
be
computed
on
the
basis
of
the
minimum
wage,
that
that
could
very
well
be
included
within
that
proviso.
however,
i
believe
that
perhaps
the
best
argument
for
interpreting
that
particular
proviso
is
the
legislative
history
wherein
the
conference
committee
said
that
this
proviso
will
have
the
effect
of
reversing
such
cases
as
mccomb
versus
scerbo,
which
was
based
directly
on
the
o'grady
case,
which
is
the
case
opposite
to
the
one
that
is
now
under
review.
and
i
think
that
that
legislative
history
had
in
it
also
that
this
court
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
no,
the
--
the
scerbo
case
involved
an
injunction
wherein
the
unpaid
minimum
and
overtime
actually
worked
for
was
granted.
but
the
proviso
split
that
apart
and
wouldn't
let
them
do
it.
it
shows
a
policy
of
congress
not
to
let
this
--
this
restitution
and
the
injunction
go
together.
i
see
my
time
is
limited.
i
would
like
to
--
i
would
like
to
say
that
an
analysis
of
the
cases,
the
--
the
--
under
the
railroad
act,
the
--
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
under
the
emergency
price
control
act
show
that
in
--
and
--
in
each
instance,
where
equity
goes
and
grants
some
sort
of
damages
or
takes
extraordinary
relief
or
disestablishes
a
--
a
bargaining
representative,
that
it
is
based
upon
some
right
which
was
created
in
that
statute
or
existed
at
common
law.
and
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
includes
all
of
the
sanctions,
criminal
and
civil,
in
specific
language
and
that
the
--
a
court
of
equity
does
not
have
ancillary
power
to
go
beyond
the
words
of
this
statute
and
the
common
law
in
granting
a
relief.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
they
would
--
it
appears
to
me,
your
honor,
that
if
it
is
the
law
that
he
is
entitled
to
damages
for
discharge,
they
would
necessarily
consist
of
--
of
minimum
wages
computed
on
some
program
of
work
that
would
have
been
performed
in
the
interim.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
should
think
that
that
would
be
the
--
probably,
the
logical
the
--
cut
down,
of
course,
by
anything
that
was
earned
in
the
meantime
or
--
or
any
amount
that
he
would
not
have
earned
by
his
own
volition
or
prevented
or
would
have
been
prevented
from
earning.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
think
that
it
can
be
so
held,
your
honor,
that
that
very
type
of
recovery
would
be
specifically
enjoined
in
an
injunction
proceeding.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
don't
say
that
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
oh,
these
employees,
i
believe
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
--
were
--
yes,
they
--
they
were
given
some
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
yes
--
oh,
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
say
necessarily,
minimum
wages,
it
would
be
adding
minimum
--
minimum
wages.
i
--
i
don't
think
you
could
go
below
the
minimum
wage
prescribed
in
the
statute
in
assessing
damages
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
that's
--
mr.
r.
lamar
moore
i
would
assume
so,
but
i
don't
think
there
are
any
allocable
--
