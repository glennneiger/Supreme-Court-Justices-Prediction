mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
associate
justices,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
railroad
employee,
a
yard
conductor,
who
was
injured
while
attempting
to
carry
out
his
duties
incident
to
a
switching
movement
at
the
ford
assembly
plant
in
north
of
virginia.
he
is
complaining
of
two
actions
of
the
court
below,
the
first
the
court
deprived
him
of
a
jury
trial
with
respect
to
the
liability
of
the
railroad
insofar
as
how
this
accident
occurred
and
the
railroad's
breach
of
duty
under
the
federal
employer
liability
act.
the
second
question
is
a
little
more
intriguing.
it
cites
as
error
of
the
lower
court's
decision
in
holding
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
doctor
employed
by
the
railroad
to
treat
this
injured
employee
was
not
an
agent
or
an
employee
within
the
contemplation
of
fela.
now
the
first
question
we
feel
is
boiled
down
to
three
charges
of
liability
but
with
respect
to
the
railroad.
number
one
we
feel
that
the
record
is
clear
that
a
jury
question
was
created
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
time
that
was
allotted
to
the
performance
of
the
particular
train
movement
involved.
number
two,
we
feel
that
the
petitioner
was
furnished
inexperienced
personnel
and
three
we
feel
that
an
improper
work
area
was
furnished
him
with
respect
to
the
condition
of
the
right
of
way
immediately
adjacent
to
the
track.
now,
how
did
this
accident
occur?
the
ford
motor
company
took
a
30-minute
lunch
period.
while
their
employees
were
eating
lunch
they
weren't
at
the
railroad
to
spot
the
railroad
cars
containing
the
parts
necessary
to
assemble
the
automobiles
at
certain
predestined
spots
inside
of
a
house
shed.
the
car
had
to
be
exactly
positioned
opposite
this
opening
in
order
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
ford
plant.
the
railroad
in
an
attempt
to
accommodate
its
customer
allotted
only
30
minutes
for
a
shifting
operation
which
without
--
substantial
contradiction
and
certainly
the
evidence
is
to
be
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner
in
the
view
of
the
deprivation
of
the
right
by
jury,
the
evidence
was
that
with
two
inexperienced
brakemen,
it
would
require
from
an
hour
to
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
and
that
even
if
the
brakeman
were
experienced
which
is
not
the
case
here,
it
would
require
approximately
50
minutes.
so
the
railroad
was
creating
a
situation
that
involved
haste
by
a
necessity
in
order
to
accommodate
the
ford
plant
they
were
requiring
a
job
to
be
done
in
half
the
time
that
ordinary
prudence
would
suggest.
now
on
this
particular
day
this
yard
conductor
who
ordinarily
would
give
his
signals
from
the
ground
to
his
brakeman
had
been
furnished
with
two
young
men
who
had
never
before
in
their
lives
spotted
cars
within
the
house
shared
of
the
ford
plant.
on
page
51
of
the
record,
mr.
pennington,
the
so
called
senior
bake
--
brakeman
was
asked,
“did
you
know
how
to
spot
cars
in
the
house?”
“no
sir.”
“did
you
need
any
assistance
on
the
morning
of
july
03,
1957?”
“yes
sir.”
“whom
did
you
ask
to
assist
you?”
“peanut.”
“speak
a
little
louder
we
can
hardly
hear
you,
mr.
davis”,
that
was
the
yard
conductor.
now
we
have
even
more
interest,
mr.
pennington
states
what
mr.
davis
was
attempting
to
do
at
the
time
that
he
slipped
from
the
grab-on
of
the
car
and
caused
his
injury.
“do
you
know
why
he
was
coming
back?”
mr.
davis
had
been
walking
in
consistent
with
this
30
minute
work
schedule
that
created
a
climate
of
haste;
he
was
walking
along
the
top
of
these
freight
cars
to
get
to
a
position
where
he
could
assist
this
inexperienced
brakeman.
when
he
reached
the
gondola
car
which
required
him
to
come
down
the
side
of
the
box
car
and
hasten
up
and
then
get
up
on
the
next
box
car
and
continue
on
to
his
brake
work.
“he
was
coming
back
there
with
me
to
show
me
where
to
spot
cars.”
“when
did
you
last
see
him?”
“i
seen
him
when
he
come
to
the
gon.”
“what
do
you
mean
by
gon,
gon
door?
”“what
do
you
mean
by
gone
done
door?”
“yes
sir
that
is
the
lower
car
from
the
box
car.”
“what
if
anything
did
he
have
to
do
when
he
came
to
the
gondola?”
“he
had
to
come
down
and
run
up
ahead
and
catch
a
car
that
was
higher
so
he
could
walk
on
back
to
me.”
“were
you
asked
to
do
anything
out
there
that
day
or
directed
to
do
anything
out
there
that
day
prior
to
the
time
that
this
accident
happened
that
you
were
unable
to
do?”
“yes
sir,
i
made
quite
a
few
mistakes.”
now
here
was
a
yard
conductor,
given
a
job
to
do
in
30
minutes,
given
two
men
that
had
never
before
spotted
cars
and
he
--
within
this
climate
of
haste
he
was
doing
everything
he
could
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
--
of
the
customer
of
the
railroad.
he
was
going
back
to
this
inexperienced
brakeman
when
he
slipped
from
the
romp
of
the
ladder.
haste
makes
waste
and
this
waste
was
created
by
the
railroad
in
requiring
an
unusual
schedule
for
this
particular
involved
movement.
we've
already
alluded
to
the
inexperience
of
the
personnel.
with
respect
to
the
improper
work
area,
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes
sir
there
--
there
is.
the
witness,
pennington,
said
that
he
was
coming
back
in
order
to
run
up
and
get
to
the
next
car,
he
was
coming
down
the
freight
car
in
order
to
run
by
the
gondola
and
get
up
on
the
next
freight
car
so
he
could
arrive
back
at
where
pennington
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
that
in
the
--
in
the
record
is
page
51
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
he
had
--
page
52,
question;
“what
if
anything
did
you
have
to
do
when
he
came
to
the
gondola
and
had
to
come
down
and
run
up
ahead
and
catch
a
car
that
was
higher
so
he
could
walk
on
back
to
me?”
now
if
the
court
pleases,
when
you
set
a
schedule
of
30
minutes
to
do
something
that
would
ordinarily
require
you
to
do
in
an
hour,
you
must
be
in
a
climate
of
haste
during
that
whole
period
of
activity.
you're
working
under
a
pressure
that
is
just
as
if
this
court
had
to
decide
20
cases
between
now
and
tomorrow
and
write
opinions
for
it.
the
court
would
have
pressure.
it
would
be
doing
everything
it
could
to
fulfill
this
deadline
that
for
some
reason
was
imposed
and
we
would
create
a
situation
which
would
be
similar
to
that
which
was
imposed
upon
clifford
davis.
now
there
we
think
is
the
heart
of
this
case
even
though
we
have
a
third
point
with
respect
to
point
one.
namely,
that
the
act
was
passed
by
congress
in
anticipation
that
--
that
the
requirements
of
the
industry,
the
requirements
of
the
railroad
would
create
a
hazardous
situation
and
here
the
railroad
choose
--
chose
to
satisfy
the
customer
at
the
expense
of
a
safe
working
condition,
a
safe
place
to
work,
a
safe
climate
in
which
to
work
and
when
they
chose
to
satisfy
the
customer
at
the
expense
of
the
employee,
then
the
act
seeks
to
afford
the
broadest
of
coverage
to
the
worker.
now
just
in
passing
the
improper
work
area
of
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
that
the
right
of
way
alongside
of
a
track
should
be
flat
because
men
are
descending
from
the
cars
to
the
ground.
and
here
we
have
a
situation
where
one
witness
testified
that
it
was
tantamount
to
a
drainage
district
that
was
on
page
59
of
the
record.
all
witnesses
testified
that
the
earth
left
to
the
side
of
the
track
that
had
a
45
degree
angle.
other
witnesses
described
that
condition
is
being
rough
and
they
all
agreed
that
it
should
be
flat.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
dr.
thiemeyer,
if
the
court
pleases
testify
that
--
just
--
on
page
31,
force
exerted
on
an
obliquity
--
obliquity
usually
offers
more
stress,
more
force.
he
testified
that
by
landing
on
a
45
degree
slope,
this
man's
entire
weight
was
pushed
down
on
his
toes
and
even
though
he
only
dropped
a
distance
of
15
feet
that
by
applying
all
of
his
weight
forward
at
an
oblique
angle
that
that
would
create
an
unusual
and
--
and
far
more
stress
than
if
it
had
been
on
a
15
feet,
i
mean
if
it
had
been
on
a
straight
surface.
now
the
court
took
over
as
it
--
as
the
lower
court
did
in
many
places
of
these
cases.
this
action
which
strange
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
norfolk
the
character
of
fela
and
the
court
created
the
finding
at
which
judge
frankfurter
has
referred
to
in
other
decisions
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
a
--
of
resistance
or
an
atmosphere
of
unawareness
of
the
full
scope
of
--
of
fela
and
the
court
took
over
here
and
said,
doctor
well
if
he
had
fallen
on
a
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
federal
employees
liability
act,
i
apologize
for
the
abbreviation
f-e-l-a,
the
fela
act,
federal
employees
liability
act
if
your
honor
please.
the
court
said
that
if
this
man
had
fallen
on
a
flat
surface
would
he
have
fractured
his
heels
and
that
under
the
range
of
the
judge
says
that,
yes
judge
he
could
have
fractured
his
heel
but
he
--
he
didn't
fracture
his
heel,
he
fractured
his
metatarsal
bone
and
he
did
so
because
the
doctor
said
he
fell
on
an
oblique
45
degree
angle
rather
than
on
a
flat
surface.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
by
about
6
inches
if
your
honor
please.
it
was
a
45
degree
slope.
we
have
pictures
in
the
evidence
but
it
was
just
a
--
it
just
involved
about
6
to
7
--
the
lower
level
would
have
been
up
ground
to
180
degrees
would
--
would
have
involve
5
to
6
inches.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes
sir?
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
they
do
not
have
to
cushion
it
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
--
but
they
do
have
to
make
it
level
because
a
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
at
all
places
in
a
--
where
a
shifting
operation
and
a
switching
yard
for
a
man
who
is
going
to
have
to
descend
--
the
braking
and
coupling
was
many
times
during
a
shifting
operation
into
an
assembly
plant.
this
is
not
--
i
would
--
in
the
great
state
of
wyoming
where
the
freight
car
would
go
and
on
and
on
but
this
is
a
shifting
situation
with
a
very
tight
schedule
requiring
particularity
in
the
placement
of
the
cars
and
the
maximum
agility
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
personnel.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
that's
where
i'm
going.
that's
exactly
the
point.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
now
i
want
to
proceed
to
the
point
that
i
think
is
much
more
intriguing.
it's
a
--
it's
a
point
of
national
importance
and
in
my
humble
opinion
in
the
application
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
and
i
frankly
feel
that
the
device
is
somewhat
insidious
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
railroad
industry.
and
that
is
the
position
of
a
doctor
employed
by
a
railroad
in
the
business
of
the
railroad
of
adjusting
claims.
the
adjustment
of
claims
of
injured
employees
is
a
major
portion
of
the
business
of
railroads
and
with
the
astute
management
and
constructive
intelligence
of
railroad
managing
front,
they
have
come
up
with
a
--
a
scheme
i
call
it,
that
is
rather
remarkable.
in
this
case
the
--
who
employed
the
doctor?
was
it
the
general
surgeon
or
was
it
someone
else?
it
was
the
claim
agent.
the
general
claim
agent
employed
the
doctor.
now
his
relationship
with
that
claim
agent
is
very
interesting
in
my
opinion.
i
cannot
relate
this
most
crucial
fact
in
a
--
more
vividly
than
the
railroad
doctor
did
who
was
called,
what
are,
on
page
37
if
the
court
pleases,
what
are
some
of
the
other
types
of
relationships
that
you
have
with
mr.
goodwin,
that's
the
chief
claim
agent,
about
injuries,
settling
claims,
how
bad
someone
is
hurt,
do
you
have
to
ask
the
employee
whether
you
may
talk
to
mr.
goodwin
about
his
case
or
do
you
feel
that
you
can
do
that
directly
to
mr.
goodwin
without
consulting
the
employee?
i've
been
doing
it
for
25
years
--
28
years.
would
you
talk
about
what
was
wrong,
what
was
not
wrong
with
the
private
patient
to
some
other
party
without
first
consulting
the
private
patient?
why
would
i
talk
to
another
party
about
it
that?
they
might
all
want
to
know
what
is
wrong
with
mrs.
jones,
would
you
tell
them?
no,
alright
you
don't
hesitate
to
tell
mr.
goodwin
what
is
wrong
with
an
injured
employee
do
you?
of
course
he
sent
him
to
me
to
treat.
now
who
is
the
agent
or
who,
because
he,
the
chief
claim
agent
who
is
interested
in
settling
claims,
sent
him
to
me
to
treat.
alright
are
you
paid
by
the
virginian
railway
to
treat
the
man?
yes
and
then
i
would
go
on.

we
say
here
that
you
do
not
need
to
accommodate
the
scope
that
the
record
is
clear
that
the
doctor
is
the
agent
of
the
railroad.
he
sent
him
to
me;
i'm
not
going
to
send
a
report
to
the
injured
worker.
i'm
only
going
to
send
a
report
on
the
physical
condition
to
the

adjustor
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
that's
exactly
right
if
your
honor
please
and
in
this
case
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
that's
my
second
cause
of
action
if
your
honor
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
no
sir
the
judge
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
doctor
could
never
be
an
employee
or
agent
of
a
railroad.
he
was
an
independent
contractor
and
as
such
would
have
to
stand
on
his
own
footing.
now
we
humbly
disagree
with
the
lower
court
in
view
of
the
broad
scope
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
and
i
think
that
the
treatment
or
lack
of
treatment
given
this
injured
man
would
shock
the
conscience
of
even
a
first
aid
corpsman
in
the
navy.
the
man
had
a
fractured
foot,
the
railroad
doctor
found
out
about
it,
he
put
a
bandage
around
his
foot,
and
the
man
went
home.
he
was
in
excruciating
pain.
he
borrowed
a
pair
of
crutches
from
someone
in
the
neighborhood.
he
crutched
his
way
back
to
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
says,
“why
have
you
got
those
crutches?”
he
says,
“my
foot
hurts.”
the
doctor
says,
“throw
it
away
and
--
and
walk
on
your
foot,
that's
the
way
it
will
heal.”
he
sent
him
back
to
work
for
the
railroad
without
re
--
without
re-x-raying
the
foot
to
see
whether
the
fracture
had
even
healed
and
doctor
thiemeyer
testified
that
it
was
improper
so
to
do.
that
you
should
rest
the
foot,
give
the
bones
a
chance
to
heal
before
you
put
pressure
back
on
them.
that
by
sending
a
man
out
to
put
even
weight
on
his
foot
extended
the
time
of
cure,
aggravated
the
fracture
and
that's
our
opening
argument
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
the
court
pleases
i
think
that
the
confusion
of
counsel
in
interpreting
the
record
shows
that
it's
uniquely
a
jury
trial
here.
one
thing
that
i
stated
in
my
opening
address
was
that
on
page
52
of
the
record
the
reason
why
mr.
davis
was
going
the
way
he
was,
was
stated
by
pennington.
pennington
had
never
before
done
this
job
and
he
says
whose
duty
it
is
to
spot
cars?
it's
me
and
do
you
know
why
davis
was
coming
back?
he
was
coming
back
there
with
me
to
show
me
where
to
spot
cars.
that's
the
very
involved
movement
he
didn't
know
what
to
do
and
that's
clear
in
the
record
if
your
honors
please.
now
on
--
on
the
haste
that
my
man
was
put
on
down
on
page
13
he
testified,
i
was
going
to
get
down
and
go
through
to
rush
on
where
more
or
less
rush
to
the
end
of
the
car
where
pennington
was
and
then
we
come
to
mr.
whitehorn
who
is
an
assistant
yard
master
and
he
describes
his
job,
the
climate
of
this
job
so
vividly
when
he
says
on
page
35
and
that
is
it
really
--
it
puts
the
conductor
in
the
middle
when
he's
got
two
new
brakemen.
and
i
say
that
the
federal
employers
liability
act
does
not
anticipate
that
a
work
request
to
accommodate
a
customer
will
put
a
yard
conductor
or
a
brakeman
or
anyone
else
in
the
middle.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
35
yes
if
your
honor
please
the
yardmaster's
testifying
to
that
there
that
it
is
two
ways
of
looking
at
this
thing,
two
ways
of
answering
it
in
order
to
try
to
satisfy
the
ford
–
at
ford
plant
they
do
a
little
rushing
and
that
he
goes
on
his
last
remark
he
said,
puts
the
conductor
in
the
middle
and
that's
just
where
this
poor
fellow
wound
up,
in
the
middle
because
the
dilemma
here
if
the
railroad
attorney
says,
did
you
violate
a
safety
rule
he
has
lost
his
job.
they
bring
him
up
before
the
disciplinary
board
so
he
never
can
say
in
open
court
i
violated
the
safety
rule.
he
says
that
i
--
i
was
doing
what
i
could
the
best
i
could
but
it's
impossible
to
do
this
job
safely
in
30
minutes.
now
if
the
court
pleases
i
don't
want
to
leave
without
clarifying
one
thing
about
the
practice
of
this
claim
agent
sending
people
to
this
railroad
doctor.
on
page
7
of
the
record,
the
head
claim
agent
says,
the
question
is,
is
it
one
of
your
duties
to
select
the
company
physician
and
he
almost
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
now
listen
to
this
answer
if
your
honors
pleases.
answer
-
and
he
works
--
he
started
to
say,
he
works
for
me
but
he
stopped.
he
works,
he
reports
to
the
claim
department
to
me
yes
sir.
and
is
it
your
duty
to
select
him?
yes,
and
then
for
example
do
you
give
instructions
to
superior
employees,
have
you
given
oral
instructions
to
them
that
when
a
person
is
hurt
to
take
them
to
doctor
(inaudible)?
no
i
don't
do
that
directly.
it
is
just
kind
of
a
general
understanding
and
it
is
a
part
of
the
rules.
if
your
honor
please,
the
control
of
that
doctor
who
is
not
adhering
to
the
typical
client-patient
relationship
brings
an
advantage
to
the
railroad
and
if
your
honor
please
for
every
advantage
there's
a
disadvantage
and
the
disadvantage
here,
if
they're
going
to
control
the
doctor
they're
going
to
be
responsible
for
his
improper
actions
thank
you.
