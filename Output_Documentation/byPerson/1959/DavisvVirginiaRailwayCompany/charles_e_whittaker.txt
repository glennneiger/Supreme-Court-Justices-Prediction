one
quick
question.
i
know
that
in
some
railroads
contributions
are
made
by
employees
to
a
so
called
medical
association,
is
this
true
in
this
case?
justice

it
is
not
contributory
at
any
way?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
he
ever
(inaudible)
that
it
was
one
or
the
other?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

started
putting
out
about
those
shoes,
didn't
he?
grease
on
his
shoe
or
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
he
never
did
say
that
it
was
one
or
the
other?
