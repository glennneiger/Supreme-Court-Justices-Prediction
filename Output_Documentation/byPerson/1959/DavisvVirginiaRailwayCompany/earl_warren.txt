clifford
m.
davis
versus
virginia
railway
company.
mr.
davis
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcnamara.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
is
the
one
that
mr.
howell
referred
us
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
47?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there's
a
little
problem
to
that,
isn't
it?
doesn't
it
say
that
employees
injured
on
duty
should,
if
able,
report
to
the
nearest
resident
surgeon,
the
time
you've
spoken
of
or
if
no
resident
surgeon
is
available,
to
the
nearest
company
surgeon.
so
he
should
do
it
as
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
the
jury
will
hole
that
--
as
opposed
to
what
--
to
give
what
effect
it
wanted
to
that
rule,
but
only
you
wouldn't
be
bound
by
which
--
what
the
doctor
said.
what
is
it,
if
the
rule
was
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
--
if
the
jury
found
by
the
interpretation
put
on
this
rule
by
the
doctor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
doctor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
by
claims
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
except
insofar
as
the
rule
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
you
say
that
was
the
basis
on
which
they
did
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
experienced
in
doing
what
they
were
doing
at
this
particular
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
this
particular
place,
in
this
yard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
the
character
of
the
yard
and
the
slope
of
the
--
slope
of
the
--
of
the
terrain
underneath
the
train
have
something
to
do
whether
if
they
were
acting
in
--
in
a
--
a
hurry
and
acting
on
a
new
job?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
it
be
different
if
it
was
flat
instead
of
sloping?
chief
justice
earl
warren
insofar
as
they
alight
from
the
car,
isn't
there--
isn't
there
a
difference
in
the
footing
and
a
difference
in
--
in
the
man's
likelihood
of
falling
depending
upon
whether
it
is
--
it
is
flat
or
whether
it
is
smooth
(voice
overlap)
or
whether
it
is
sloping
away
from
the
train?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
that
issue
in
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
counsel
said
it
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
have
to
do
with
--
with
where
his
foot
struck
when
he
--when
he
fell
down
from
the
car,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
the
testimony
of
--
and
also
by
the
same
doctor
was
in
effect
--
to
the
effect
that
if
it
was
flat,
he
would
be
less
likely
to
break
anything?
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
i
--
i
read
it
some
place
i
don't
think
i
read
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
i
see
that
--
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
he
--
where
is
his
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcnamara
just
to
go
back
to
what
i
asked
you
a
few
moments
ago
on
page
31
of
the
record
the
question
was,
doctor
i
am
going
to
try
to
reframe
this
question.
i
want
you
to
first
of
all
consider
mr.
davis
as
an
active
railroad
worker
engaged
in
switching
cars,
jumping
from
moving
cars.
now
on
this
day
when
he
fell,
if
he
had
fallen
on
a
horizontal
surface
which
was
composed
of
dirt
covered
with
turf
or
grass
straight
down
15
feet,
do
you
think
it
would
be
probable
that
a
fracture
of
the
whatever
that
bone
is
would
occur?
answer
-
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
i
feel
that
his
falling
on
an
oblique
surface
would
make
him
more
prone
to
a
fracture
than
falling
on
a
flat
surface.
now
isn't
that
exactly
what
i
asked
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
read
if
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
read
that
question
and
answer
your
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
might
finish
your
statement
just
whatever
it
might
be
mr.
mcnamara.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howell.
