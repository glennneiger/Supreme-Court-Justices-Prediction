that
has
i
suppose
of
the
ground
of
alleged
violation
independent
of
these
grounds
of
the
right
to
work
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
regarding
that
candidate
was
very
close
to
this
that
whatever
may
be
the
reason
for
an
employee
to
presume
when
you
can
see
it
employs
abuse
and
if
the
railroad
had
provided
a
(inaudible)
for
the
purpose
of
sending
the
employee
to
his
work
that
the
railroad
would
then
by
owing
to
the
negligence,
that
position
of
treating
of
the
employee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
didn't
get
the
theory
on
that
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
gather
that
the
railroad
made
available
to
injured
employees
a
surgeon
in
which
in
this
sequence,
was
he
a
resident
surgeon
or
a
company
surgeon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
no
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is,
is
he
a
company
surgeon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
pays
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
do
i
take
it
that
employees
are
told
that
--
that
is
at
least
employees
with
the
injury
this
petitioner
had
that
they
may
consult
him
in
respect
to
that
injury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
mcnamara
i
just
--
i
think
justice
black
referred
to
this
page
42
just
below
what
you
--
right
at
42
below
as
to
what
you
referred
us
to
--
well
i've
no
--
i'm
sorry
its
page
22,
where
again
i
guess
the
petitioner
says
he's
testifying
the
man
gave
me
the
list
and
he
knows
that
the
job
cannot
be
done
in
30
minutes
and
instructed
me
that
i'll
have
to
have
this
to
be
set
up
did
not
tell
you
to
do
it
in
a
certain
time
if
it
meant
you
had
to
do
it
in
an
unsafe
manner,
did
he?
he
meant
for
me
to
do
it
in
--
by
30
minutes
and
down
below
he
gave
me
the
list
and
instructed
me
that
the
job
was
to
be
done
in
30
minutes
while
the
ford
men
are
at
lunch.
that
was
breaking
a
safety
rule,
telling
me
that
the
job
was
to
be
done
in
30
minutes.
you've
never
been
told
to
abandon
safety
precautions
by
anybody
in
virginia
railroad
or
have
you;
speaking
plain
out,
no
sir.
now
might
the
jury
infer
from
that
that
the
--
even
though
he
wasn't
told
in
terms
to
break
safety
rules
that
that
was
the
effect
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
by
standing
alone
doing
nothing
else
in
the
--
would
that
testimony
justify
submission
of
the
jury
whether
there
was
or
was
not
an
instruction
to
do
this
without
regard
to
safety?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
are
you
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
when
he
was
descending
this
ladder?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
wasn't
the
testimony
that
was
quite
for
a
requirement
that
this
be
done
within
this
time
he
would
not
have
been
on
the
box
car
but
rather
would
have
been
working
from
the
ground
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
not
because
he
even
had
to
work
or
supervising
from
the
ground
is
that
it
mr.
mcnamara
or
would

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
in
that

did
you
say?
