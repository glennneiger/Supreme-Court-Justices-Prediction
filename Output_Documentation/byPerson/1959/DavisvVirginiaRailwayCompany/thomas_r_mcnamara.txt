mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices;
before
i
get
too
involved
and
forget
it
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
reply
to
the
question
just
put
forth
by
mr.
justice
harlan
that
in
the
record
on
page
47,
mr.
goodwin,
a
claims
agent
for
the
virginian
railway
company
was
asked
whether
there
was
any
obligation
on
the
employees
to
go
to
this
particular
doctor
or
whether
that
was
a
matter
of
choice
with
them
and
his
reply
was,
they
have
the
privilege
of
going
to
the
company
doctors
that
we
supply
up
and
down
the
railroad.
they
are
not
compelled
to
go
to
those
doctors
and
if
they
want
to
go
to
a
doctor
of
their
own
choosing
they
may
do
so.
now
in
this
case,
this
plaintiff
availed
himself
of
the
services
of
the
physician
who
was
employed
by
the
railroad
to
treat
such
of
these
patients
or
employees
who
might
come
to
him.
later,
he
availed
himself
of
the
services
of
his
own
physician.
there
was
no
question
about
his
propriety
in
doing
so.
the
only
rules
pertaining
to
the
--
that
matter
are
the
ones
which
mr.
harlan
has
referred
in
the
further
rules
number
733
found
at
the
top
of
page
48
in
the
record.
â€œan
employee
injured
on
duty
who
has
received
medical
treatment
--
no
i
beg
your
pardon,
it's
at
the
top
of
page
51,
rule
732,
employees
injured
on
duty
who
select
the
services
of
physicians
or
surgeons
other
than
as
provided
by
the
company
must
assume
the
expense
thereof.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
at
the
top
of
page
51
in
the
record,
rule
732.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
it
was
the
rule
731,
the
one
immediately
in
order
of
sequence
in
the
rule
book
before
this
one
i
have
just
read
and
that
is
found
at
the
bottom
of
page
47
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
he's
a
private
practitioner
in
the
city
of
norfolk.
the
great
bulk
of
his
business
is
on
orthopedic
surgery
there
in
the
city.
he
has
his
own
office.
he
has
his
own
equipment,
he
keeps
his
own
hours.
there
is
absolutely
no
regulation
over
him
by
the
railroad
in
any
respect.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
in
that
sense
if
you
use
that
term
company
surgeon
i
suppose
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
--
he
might
be.
he
is
paid
a
monthly
regular
stipend
of
$125
per
month
by
the
virginian
railway
company.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
there
was
no
expense
to
them
if
they
choose
and
if
they
don't
want
to
go
to
him
they
can
go
to
their
own
doctor
and
pay
their
own
way.
that's
--
that's
the
regulation.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
yes
i
don't
deny
of
course
the
wording
of
the
rule.
that
rule
though
in
application
is
enforced
by
the
general
claim
agent
who
has
testified
that
they're
not
compelled
to
go
to
those
doctors.
that's
not
the
meaning
of
the
rules
insofar
as
the
railroad
is
concerned.
and
you
have
just
above
where
you're
reading
there
on
page
47,
you
find
mr.
goodwin
saying
they
are
not
compelled
to
go
to
those
doctors
and
if
they
want
to
go
to
a
doctor
of
their
own
choosing
they
may
do
so.
that
situation
is
provided
for
by
the
very
next
rule
which
i
have
referred
to
before.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
what
if
the
construction
of
the
rule
--
i'll
say
this
your
honor
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on
this
particular
point
which
i
think
is
--
is
pretty
minute
but
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
by
the
doctor?
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
there
is
no
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
by
the
claim
agent.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
now
the
claim
agent
is
a
man
who
enforces
the
rule
and
his
was
the
only
testimony
as
to
how
in
practice
it
is
followed.
that
testimony
stands
un-contradicted
in
this
record
that
it's
a
matter
of
their
choice.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
except
insofar
as
the
wording
of
this
rule
goes
but
then
that's
immediately
followed
in
the
same
book
by
the
next
rule
which
provides
for
that
--
their
going
to
their
own
physicians
if
they
so
choose
at
their
own
expense.
i
--
i
won't
say
on
that
point
your
honor
that
a
jury
would
not
be
justified
in
reading
this
just
as
you
have
read
it
that
they
should
go.
the
point
is
that
if
they're
going
to
that
or
--
or
if
they--
if
they
want
to
they
--
treatment,
the
medical
treatment
at
the
expense
of
the
company
they
should
go.
the
very
next
rule
provides
that
if
they
care
to
pay
for
their
treatment
themselves,
they
can
choose
any
doctor
they
want.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
that's
not
in
the
record
your
honor.
it's
my
understanding
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
rule
48?
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
page
48?
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
rule
733,
employees
injured
on
duty
who
has
received
medical
treatment
must
obtain
a
return
to
duty
slip
from
the
surgeon.
that's
the
only
place
that
that
particular
thing
is
mentioned,
it
was
not
dealt
with
and
i
don't
know
in
fact
as
to
whether
it's
done
or
not.
i
assume
so.
i
assume
that
if
someone
got
his
own
private
treatment,
that
he
would
--
his
doctor
would
then
advise
the
--
doctor
leigh
employed
by
the
company
that
the
man
was
fit
to
return
to
duty
and
a
duty
slip
would
be
issued.
now
if
it
pleases
the
court
the
respondent
in
this
action
takes
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
there
is
no
substantial
dispute
as
to
the
law
applicable
to
this
action
as
between
these
two
parties.
it
is
understood
by
camp
--
by
this
respondent
as
i'm
sure
it
is
by
petitioner,
that
each
case
will
stand
on
its
own
facts
and
that
if
the
proofs
introduced
in
any
action
could
be
said
with
reason
by
the
trial
court
to
justify
inferences
from
which
the
jury
of
fair
minded
men
could
conclude
if
there
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
and
if
they
could
further
conclude
with
reason
that
this
negligence
in
fact
played
some
part
however
slight
in
the
injury
of
the
--
of
the
employee
then
a
jury
question
is
made
out,
we
do
not
question
that.
the
courts
below
did
not
question
that,
this
--
the
petition
as
counsel's
brief
has
indicated
that
there
was
some
refusal
among
the
courts
--
of
the
courts
of
the
state
of
virginia
to
apply
that
principle
that
--
that
is
not
the
case.
the
case
was
thoroughly
considered
in
the
light
of
these
decisions
and
briefs
were
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
submitting
the
case
on
that
point,
on
that
principle
and
after
full
consideration
of
these
briefs
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
affirmed
the
trial
court's
ruling
that
if
proofs
were
just
not
in
this
record
from
which
with
any
reason
at
all,
jury
could
conclude
that
there
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
which
in
any
way
caused
or
contributed
to
this
man's
fall.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no
your
honor.
the
opinion
was
simply,
no
opinion
at
all,
simply
an
order
refusing
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
error
on
the
grounds
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no,
no
there
has
been
no
opinion
in
--
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
that
was
the
argument
set
forth
in
the
briefs
and
--
you
mean
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
that
was
the
argument
set
forth
in
the
briefs
and
that
was
the
grounds
upon
which
the
trial
court
struck
the
plaintiff's
evidence.
you
understand
the
procedure
was
simply
that
the
plaintiff
introduced
his
case
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the
trial
court
struck
his
evidence.
the
respondent
never
introduced
any
evidence
and
the
basis
for
striking
the
evidence
was
that
the
plaintiff's
case
did
not
make
out
any
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no
there
was
no
written
opinion
in
either
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no
it
has
no
--
no
oral
statement
in
the
record
that
i
know
of.
the
facts
as
to
how
this
accident
happened
or
in
just
are
--
are
the
controlling
issues.
they
were
considered
by
the
trial
in
the
appellate
courts
and
in
there
--
in
those
courts'
analysis
of
these
facts
they
both
determined
that
there
was
not
any
proof
from
which
was
reason
--
a
jury
issue
was
made
early.
they
boiled
down
to
this.
this
man
on
this
day,
a
summer
day
in
1957,
was
in
charge
of
an
operation
the
--
in
which
in
a
nutshell
was
to
take
certain
loaded
--
empty
cars
out
of
the
ford
plant
along
a
spare
of
track
and
get
rid
of
them.
then
to
bring
in
along
that
spare
of
track
certain
loaded
cars
and
ultimately
to
push
those
loaded
cars
into
the
assembly
plant
as
the
track
went
right
in
the
roof
--
under
the
roof
of
the
building.
the
empty
cars
had
been
removed.
the
conductor
who
was
the
plaintiff
here
and
who
was
in
charge
was
in
the
process
of
assembling
the
loaded
cars
on
this
spare
track
so
that
after
he
got
them
all
in
the
pre-designated
sequence
on
this
spare
track
thereafter
he
was
to
push
them
into
the
house
and
put
them
at
this
position
--
at
these
various
positions.
he
hadn't
gotten
them
all
assembled
yet,
there
was
still
some
eight
to
be
taken
from
the
main
tracks
and
brought
into
the
spare
track
when
he
was
walking
on
top
of
these
box
cars
in
order
to
go
to
the
end
of
the
train
closest
to
the
assembly
plant,
his
testimony
is
that
he
walked
along
the
tops
of
some
nine
cars
until
finally
he
came
to
a
gondola
car.
he
then
crossed
the
gondola
cars,
an
open
car
and
has
no
top
to
walk
on,
he
then
had
to
get
down.
he
faced
the
ladder,
he
put
his
hands
on
the
ladder,
he
turned
and
put
his
feet
on
the
ladder,
he
assumed
what
he
insisted
was
a
perfectly
normal
and
customary
position
to
descend
that
ladder.
then
for
some
reason
wholly
unexplained
he
says,
his
foot
--
feet
slipped
off
from
under
him
and
he
fell.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
train
was
moved.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
ladder
was
defective.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
his
other
fellow
employees
interfered
with
his
movement
or
hampered
or
hindered
his
descent
in
any
manner.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
he
was
hurrying.
his
testimony
was
that
he
was.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
he
abandoned
any
safety
precautions.
he
said
he
took
a
perfectly
normal
and
customary
position
on
the
ladder.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
at
page
18
and
page
19,
at
page
18
he
was
asked
by
the
court,
before
counsel,
was
defendant
cross
examined,
the
court
would
like
to
know
something
about
this;
you
came
down
a
metal
ladder,
iron
ladder
or
wooden
ladder?
answer
-
metal
ladder.
you
say
you
put
your
feet
on
the
second
ramp
from
the
top?
yes.
how
far
was
that
from
the
ground?
that
was
15,
10
or
15
feet.
when
you
put
your
feet
on
the
second
ramp
what
did
you
do
with
your
hands
if
anything?
i
had
my
hands
on
the
top
ramp.
question,
when
your
feet
slipped
off
according
to
your
testimony
at
the
second
ramp,
did
you
turn
loose
from
the
hold
you
had
on
the
ladder
with
your
hand?
answer
-
totally.
now
here's
the
question,
flatly,
what
caused
you
to
fall
off
that
ladder?
answer
-
it
is
--
it
might
have
been
greased
or
anything
on
my
shoe.
then
and
there
was
his
opportunity
if
he
felt
so
to
--
so
to
testify
that
there
was
the
rushing
that
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
doing.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no,
no
we
never
suggested
that
he
was
rushing
at
this
moment.
there
was
no
testimony
that
he
did
not
take
every
precaution
for
his
own
safety
at
coming
down
this
ladder.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
it
might
have
been
grease
or
anything
on
my
shoe.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no,
no.
now
then
on
at
the
bottom
of
page
19
he
was
asked,
is
that
a
normal
customary
position
in
using
this
type
of
ladder
and
he
answered,
it
sure
is
yes
sir.
so
he
is
on
the
ladder
in
a
normal
customary
position
having
walked
there
getting
ready
to
get
down
and
without
any
further
explanation
his
feet
slipped
off
and
he
fell
and
the
only
reason
that
we
have
in
this
record
for
that
having
happened
is
that
it
might
have
been
grease
on
his
shoe.
on
that
record
he
suggested
this
court
with
reason
can
say
that
--
that
--
that
his
fault
was
attributed
to
by
the
defendant's
negligence.
those
facts
to
that
extent
are
uncontradicted
or
completely
uncontradicted.
that's
how
the
accident
happened.
now
then
the
plaintiff's
counsel
suggests
theories
under
which
it
may
be
found
that
there
was
a
jury
question
and
one
theory
is
that
he
was
ordered
or
required
by
his
orders
to
do
work
in
an
unsafe
manner
and
to
abandon
safety
precautions
and
in
doing
so
he
was
injured.
in
the
first
place
the
record
is
clear
that
he
never
abandoned
any
faith
--
any
safety
precaution.
under
his
own
testimony,
of
course
there
was
no
suggestion
that
he
ever
did.
he
walked,
he
assumed
the
proper
position
on
the
ladder
and
the
only
suggestion
for
his
fall
was
his
own,
that
it
might
have
been
grease
on
his
shoe,
the
ladder
was
not
bent
and
there
was
no
other
movement
by
the
train
or
his
fellows
which
contributed
in
anyway
to
his
falling.
and
the
other
theory
on
the
--
the
next
part
of
that
theory
of
petitioner's
counsel
is
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
--
he
did
in
fact
take
his
safety
precautions,
nevertheless
we
--
we
are
forced
to
deal
with
the
various
reasons
why
he
says
his
orders
are
quite
in
--
not
to
take
the
safety
precaution.
very
briefly,
i
want
to
refer
to
two
points,
two
places
in
the
record
in
reply
to
that.
i
wanted
to
be
understood
clearly
by
this
court
that
the
theory
upon
which
plaintiff
is
relying
is
that
his
orders
required
him
to
abandon
safety
precautions.
now
then
he
was
doing
a
job
which
other
conductors
had
done
before
him.
and
he
was
told
the
day
that
he
went
out
there
to
take
over
this
job
which
was
a
month
prior
to
this
accident
to
get
these
trains
--
get
this
transfer
made
during
the
lunch
time
of
the
ford
company.
he
ascertained
that
that
lasted
30
minutes.
he
says
that
that
was
a
30
minute
requirement
on
him,
a
limitation
on
him
requiring
him
to
abandon
safety
precautions
if
necessary
in
order
to
accomplish
that
job
within
those
30
minutes.
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
conductors
who
had
operated
their
job
before
him
were
asked
on
page
35;
are
you
ever
required
to
do
more
than
you
would
to
do,
than
you
would
do
to
operate
safely?
and
the
answer,
no
sir,
and
the
plaintiff
himself
was
asked
at
greater
length
beginning
on
page
21
the
following
questions
after
he
testified
that
as
to
what
his
instructions
had
been
he
said
in
response
to
these
questions,
question
-
he
did
not
tell
you
that
you
had
to
meet
that
schedule
even
if
it
meant
for
you
to
abandon
safety
precautions,
did
he?
answer
-
no
sir,
no
he
did
not.
and
it
is
your
job
to
do
whatever
your
operation
is
and
at
the
same
time
to
observe
safety
precautions
for
yourself
and
your
men,
isn't
it?
and
then
that
question
was
repeated
and
his
answer,
yes
sir.
and
when
you
are
assigned
to
do
a
particular
task,
that
assignment
means
that
you
do
that
task
while
observing
your
safety
precaution,
does
it
not?
answer,
you
have
got
to
work
as
rapidly
as
you
can
and
try
to
be
safe
while
you're
doing
it.
question
and
trying
to
be
safe
while
your
doing
it
and
if
you
reach
a
point
where
it
is
necessary
to
abandon
safety,
in
order
to
do
a
certain
thing
by
a
certain
time,
you
just
have
to
go
slower,
don't
you?
answer,
yes
sir.
now
then
his
theory
is
that
his
orders
required
him
to
abandon
safety
in
order
to
do
a
certain
thing
by
a
certain
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
i
don't
believe
in
this
record
there
is
anything
in
conflict
with
this
with
what
he
has
testified
to
himself
up
here,
where
he
admits
that
if
he
reached
a
point
where
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
him
to
abandon
safety
precautions
in
order
to
do
a
certain
thing
on
a
certain
time
under
that
type
of
orders
that
he
had,
that
his
obligation
would
have
been
to
go
slower.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
yes
your
honor
we
don't
deny
that
he
was
told
to
do
this
job
on
his
testimony
while
the
ford
people
had
lunch
and
that
that
was
30
minutes.
we
--
we
submit
that
under
the
--
all
of
the
evidence
that
and
--
and
including
what
he
has
testified
to
in
defining
just
what
that
order
meant
to
him,
that
it
was
understood
as
between
the
employee
and
the
employer
that
that
was
no
time
limitation
which
would
have
required
him
at
any
time
to
have
abandoned
any
safety
precautions
on
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
if
in
fact
he
was
ordered
--
yes,
yes?
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
that's
right,
yes
sir.
there
was
no
evidence
that
with
reason,
reading
this
whole
record,
with
reason
could
have
been
said
to
say
that
this
man
was
ordered
to
abandon
his
safety
precautions
in
order
to
complete
this
job
within
this
time.
in
fact
that's
what
his
own
testimony
refutes.
now
then
he
--
the
plaintiff's
counsel
refers
also
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
word
cross.
i'd
like
to
make
this
point
clear
that
the
operation
which
was
being
conducted
when
this
accident
happened
was
the
assemblage
of
the
loaded
cars
on
the
spare
track
preliminary
to
putting
these
loaded
cars
in
the
ford
plant.
now
then
it
is
the
spotting
of
the
cars
in
the
ford
plant
in
which
these
brakemen
were
inexperienced.
they
had
both
had
a
year's
experience
in
doing
the
job
that
they
were
doing
when
this
plaintiff
was
injured.
we
refer
to
his,
not
to
this
brakemen
not
being
experienced
in
spotting
the
hoist
that
means
placing
cars
within
the
hoist.
but
that
was
not
what
was
going
on
and
their
inexperience
in
that
respect
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
--
what
was
going
on
at
that
time.
it
had
nothing
to
do
admittedly
under
this
record
with
this
plaintiff
falling
from
this
ladder.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
just
ordinary
switching
and
coupling
they
had
each
had
approximately
one
year's
experience
with
the
railroad
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no
not
that
much
in
this
yard
but
there
was
testimony
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
he
testimony
on
this
record
your
honor
was
that
the
type
of
switching
and
coupling
operations
that
was
going
on
over
here
was
no
different
from
the
--
from
what
--
what
they
would
have
been
at
any
other
yard.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
well
i
suppose
it
would.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
certainly
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
that
issue
is
--
is
in
to
this
extent,
it
does
not
involve
what
the
brakeman
other
than
this
conductor
had
to
do
or
--
or
anything
in
connection
with
their
experience.
it's
only
in
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
yes
but
after
he
fell
off
and
landed
on
the
ground.
the
fact
that
the
--
the
fact
that
the
ground
was
sloping
caused
his
arch
to
pull
up
and
caused
the
breaking
of
the
arch
bones.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
and
the
medical
test
knowing
it
was
that
if
it
had
been
flat
the
chances
are
he
would
have
broken
his
heel
and
that's
a
much
more
serious
injury
than
the
arch
bone.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
i
don't
read
it
that
way
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
the
doctor's
testimony
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
doctor
thiemeyer
testifying
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
page
30
about
half
or
three
quarters
of
the
way
down.
the
court
said,
is
it
probable
that
a
person
of
the
weight
of
the
plaintiff
falling
15
feet
to
a
flat
surface
would
likewise
have
fractures?
his
answer
-
falling
15
feet,
question.
yes,
on
a
flat
surface,
question;
on
a
flat
surface?
yes
then
he
says
i
couldn't
necessarily
say
the
second
metatarsal,
but
i
would
say
fracture
would
be
very
probable.
now
then
over
at
the
next
page
in
the
middle
of
31,
question;
the
other
fracture
would
have
been
about
the
same?
answer,
the
usual
fracture
that
occurs
in
a
straight
fall
on
that
height
is
one
of
the
os
calcis
of
the
heel
bone.
with
fall
at
obliquity
the
force
is
moved
forward
such
that
the
fracture
would
occur
in
the
metatarsal.
so
that
the
only
effect
of
the
--
the
right
of
away
being
slanted
instead
of
being
flat
was
that
he
broke
his
metatarsal
instead
of
his
heel
and
the
heel
was
a
much
more
serious
bone
to
break
than
the
metatarsal.
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
negligence
of
the
employees
or
as
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
workforce
i
simply
state
that
they
were
not
engaged
in
anything
that
the
plaintiff
was
doing
at
time
of
his
fall.
nothing
they
did,
nothing
they
didn't
do,
had
anything
to
with
his
falling
off
the
ladder
and
the
plaintiff
relies
simply
on
the
fact
that
he
was
on
top
of
the
box
car
whereas
he
might
not
have
been
if
he
had
had
a
greater
number
of
brakemen
and
they
had
been
more
experienced.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
fully
answered
in
the
case
of
atlantic
coast
line
against
reynolds
which
case
would
have
to
be
overruled
by
this
court
if
--
if
the
court
rules
that
there
was
a
jury
question
in
this
present
action
on
the
inadequacy
and
insufficiency
of
the
number
of
brakemen
in
the
case
of
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
your
honor
on
its
face
it
is
and
if
--
if
that
should
have
been
pointed
out
by
me
i
apologize.
i
don't
read
it
that
way
and
i'm
so
familiar
with
this
record
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
--
reading
the
whole
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
no
i
can't
read
it
in
any
different
words
but
i
mean
if
you
read
the
entire
testimony
of
doctor
thiemeyer,
his
reference
here
to
a
fracture
in
that
person
being
more
prone
to
a
fracture.
he
is
referring
to
a
fracture
of
the
metatarsal
and
he
--
his
other
statements
would
bare
that
out
which
is
the
co-words
here
i
don't
deny
at
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
its
in
my
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
--
at
page
13
it's
in
my
brief.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
the
point
is
this,
plaintiff
complains
that
there
were
an
insufficient
number
of
brakemen
and
that
they
were
unqualified
and
that
by
reason
of
this
he
had
to
be
up
on
top
of
this
car
from
which
he
ultimately
fell
and
that
therefore
that
contributed
to
his
accident.
the
exact
same
point
was
dealt
with
in
atlan
--
in
reynolds
against
atlantic
coastline
336
u.s.
and
the
court
held
there
in
one
simple
point
determinative
of
that
entire
case
that
factors
which
caused
if
one
to
perform
his
ordinary
duties
to
which
he
is
accustomed
cannot
with
reason
be
said
to
be
causative
of
an
unexplained
fall
--
falling
of
course
in
the
course
of
performing
those
duties.
in
the
atlantic
coastline
case
there
was
a
brakeman
who
--
well
my
red
light
is
on
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
in
the
atlantic
coastline
case
then
there
was
a
brakeman
whose
duty
was
to
give
certain
signals.
he
normally
gave
them
from
the
sixth
car
up
ahead
because
the
railroad
had
negligently
allowed
certain
(inaudible)
to
go
along
his
right
of
way,
he
was
required
to
cross
from
the
sixth
car
to
the
seventh
car
this
time
in
order
to
give
his
signals
and
he
fell
while
making
that
crossing.
there
was
further
evidence
that
if
he
had
had
more
brakemen
he
wouldn't
have
to
make
that
trip
anyway.
and
he
raised
those
two
points
as
evidence
of
negligence
and
causation
in
his
suit
against
the
railroad
and
in
this
action
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
such
evidence.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
the
answer
to
that
was
twofold,
one
he
wasn't
hurrying.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
he
was
not
hurrying.
he
did
not
in
fact
abandon
any
safety
precaution.
he
took
everyone
that
he
could.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
if
it
pleases
the
court
at
--
those
are
the
words
of
the
plaintiff's
counsel
those
are
not
the
words
of
the
plaintiff,
those
are
not
found
in
the
records,
they
are
found
in
the
briefs
but
not
in
the
record.
the
evidence
is
that
the
--
the
man
was
supposed
to
do
something
a
certain
time.
the
theory
upon
which
the
plaintiff
relies
in
that
respect
is
that
his
orders
required
him
to
abandon
safety
precautions.
the
defense
is
that
he
didn't
abandon
safety
precautions
and
that
his
orders
in
fact
did
not
require
him
to
do
so.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
the
answer
to
which
plaintiff's
counsel
referred
was
given
by
a
witness,
a
brakeman
who
watched
the
plaintiff
come
along
the
tops
of
the
cars
and
then
watched
him
start
down
the
ladder
then
he
disappeared
from
this
witness's
view.
that
witness
did
not
say
he
was
hurrying
along
the
ladder.
he
didn't
say
he
was
hurrying
when
he
got
down
the
ladder.
the
question
was,
what
was
he
going
to
do
then?
and
he
said,
he
was
going
to
run
up
to
another
position
and
then
walk
up
to
where
i
was
and
that
was
the
word
run
as
in
that
--
that
was
referring
to
something
that
that
witness
thought
this
man
might
have
been
going
to
do
after
he
fell
but
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
what
he
was
doing
at
the
time
he
fell.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
your
honor
the
record
is
a
little
confusing
on
this
point
at
that
--
on
this
particular
point.
this
man
was
given
these
instructions
a
month
before
this
accident
happened.
he
wasn't
handed
a
list
and
said,
do
this
today
in
30
minutes
and
those
--
and
the
list
include
something
which
was
impossible
to
be
done
at
that
time.
he
was
given
a
general
instruction
to
do
this
while
the
ford
people
at
lunch.
other
conductors
had
been
given
the
same
instructions
before
him.
sometimes
it
was
possible,
sometimes
it
was
not,
sometimes
they
did
it
in
that
time,
sometimes
they
didn't.
when
they
didn't
there
was
no
recrimination.
they
received
extra
overtime
pay
and
the
understanding
from
reading
the
entire
testimony
on
that
point
was
clear
between
the
employees
and
their
employer
that
they
were
certainly
not
required
to
do
anything
to
meet
any
time
schedule
which
would
have
forced
them
to
abandon
any
safety
precautions.
the
one
conductor
who
testified
as
to
past
history
said,
we're
never
required
to
do
anything
more
than
we
were
to
operate
safely.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
your
honor
i
don't
question
the
fact
that
--
i
think
probably
it
would.
i
don't
think
it's
under
the
--
this
record
would
constitute
a
jury
question
of
whether
that
caused
a
concern
because
in
fact
he
wasn't
hurrying.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
he
was
not
hurrying,
he
was
not
--
he
did
not
abandon
any
safety
precautions.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
yes
when
he
was
walking
along
those
box
cars
to
get
ready
to
do
what
he
was
engaged
in
doing
when
he
fell.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
yes
there
was
and
in
that
--
in
reference
to
that
point
that
not
--
not
the
testimony
that
but
for
this
regulation
but
testimony
was
a
but
for
the
inadequate
number
of
employees
and
their
lack
of
experience
he
would
not
have
been
on
this
car.
mr.
thomas
r.
mcnamara
well
he
said
that
--
i
believe
he
said
and
some
other
conductors
said
that
if
--
if
he
had
more
brakemen
he
wouldn't
have
been
on
the
car
in
the
first
place,
that
was
his
testimony.
the
fact
is
that
he
had
as
many
brakemen
as
it
had
ever
been
on
that
job
and
the
fact
remains
that
merely
because
he
was
up
on
the
box
car
where
he
normally
and
customarily
was
during
the
course
of
his
duty
is
not
considered
causative
of
his
falling
off.
