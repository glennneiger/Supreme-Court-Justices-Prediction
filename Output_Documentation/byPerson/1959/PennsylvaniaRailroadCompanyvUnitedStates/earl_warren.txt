mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
doub.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
so
understood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
doub
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doub,
may
i
ask
you
this?
there
must
be
some
issue
between
the
two
of
you
if
you
--
if
you're
going
to
argue,
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
is
there
an
issue
between
you
and
the
other
side.
and
if
so,
will
you
state
the
issue
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
issue
between
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
other
side
of
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
you
going
to
argue
that
we
should
go
along
with
the
government
or
that
we
should
not
go
along
with
the
government
in
this
matter?
which
do
you
want
us
to
do?
now,
you
can't
each
defy
and
keep
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you're
--
if
you're
going
to
agree
with
the
other
side
on
all
of
the
issues,
then
the
question
is,
do
you
want
us
to
reverse
or
affirm
this
case?
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
we
think
that
we
should
do
what
you've
already
suggested.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
and
why
--
why
do
--
what
would
we
got
to
argue
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
a
little
surprised
at
the
--
at
the
commission
saying
that
it
only
wants
to
be
--
make
an
appearance
in
exceptional
cases
because
as
i
remember
it,
only
at
the
last
congress,
the
commission
had
a
bill
in
there
to
prevent
the
department
of
justice
from
--
from
injecting
itself
into
each
--
into
each
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
thought
that
the
department
of
justice
would
very
much
oppose
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
doub,
if
--
if
you
believe
in
the
position
you
took
in
your
briefs,
why
do
you
argue
the
contrary
to
us
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
should
we
argue
those
things
that
are
not
in
the
case?
what
is
the
purpose
of
--
that's
all
i'm
trying
to
get
at
mr.
doub.
if
there's
a
--
tell
us
what
the
purpose
of
it
is.
if
you
want
us
to
--
if
--
if
you
want
to
establish
some
point
for
us,
why
--
tell
us.
and
if
it's
in
the
case,
of
course,
we'd
like
to
hear
it.
but
i
--
if
that
seems
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
just
seems
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
not
very
unrealistic
to
me
to
--
your
argument
on
something
that
you
agree
with
the
other
side
with
100%
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
if
you
doubt
your
position,
if
you
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cox.
