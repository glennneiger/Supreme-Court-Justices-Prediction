justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
cox?
was
there
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims
to
have
entertained
that
matter?
a
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
think
not.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
we
write
a
full
opinion
in
this
case,
it
would
have
to
be,
would
it
not,
mr.
doub,
upon
the
facts,
issues,
and

in
this
case?

justice
charles
e.
whittaker

that
before
us
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

that

of
the
case
by

commission's
order
was
reviewable
in
an
appropriate
district
court?
justice

quarrel?

the
quarrel?
justice
charles

charles
e.
whittaker

beg
your
pardon.
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
would
agree
with
you
on
that,
but
we
don't
have
that
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
