justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question,
as
a
matter
of
curiosity?
is
what
you've
just
said
in
--
mean
that
the
government
has
shifted
its
position,
what
it
was
below?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
read
their
brief.
it
could've
carried
your
name.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
then
what
puzzles
me
is
this.
one
can
think
of
practical
considerations.
i
don't
say
they're
legal
considerations
or
permissible
ones
but
the
practical
considerations
why
this
rigmarole
view,
is
inefficient.
then,
why
there
should
be
review
if
it's
legally
possible
in
the
referral
court?
yet,
you're
taking
a
position
that
is
wholly
in
agreement
with
your
adversaries
and
we
have
nothing
before
us
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
any
other
view
that
to
argue,
they
--
a
different
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
maybe
you
can
enlighten
me
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
to
what
the
fact
of
considerations
are,
that
claims
about
this
curious
result
because
you
could
really
stand
up
here
and
confess
error.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
but
you
can
think
of
--
this
is
our
premise
on
reviewing
the
referral
order
or
the
order
pursuant
to
the
referral
as
a
formal
order
which
is
reviewable
in
the
ordinary
way.
but
it's
not
hard
to
think
of
arguments
that
could
be
made
that
even
--
that
in
a
referral
case
of
this
kind,
short
of
formal
review
which
you
say
is
impossible
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
i
agree
with
that.
that
nonetheless,
the
reviews
of
the
commission
in
the
case
of
this
kind
could
be
taken
only
in
an
advisory
sense.
and
therefore,
in
practical
effect
could
be
reviewed
by
the
referral
court.
and
those
arguments
are
--
if
they
had
any
validity
to
them,
maybe
they're
wholly
unsound
or
not
represented
in
this
proceeding
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
a
practical
question?
do
you
--
having
put
the
views
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
before
us,
as
to
which
you
don't
agree.
well,
the
united
states
now
in
this
case
prepared
to
confess
error?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
maybe
you
haven't
and
put
it
i
those
terms?
you
are,
though,
prepared
to
confess
error?
