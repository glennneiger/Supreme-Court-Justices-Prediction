were
the
shipping
--
were
the
shipping
documents
changed
after
they
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
that
the
question
of
whether
export
rate
of
parts,
the
rates
couldn't
be
higher
--
the
reasonable
rates
couldn't
be,
or
a
rate
higher
than
the
export
rates
would
be
unreasonable,
was
itself
a
subject
matter
for
the
so-called
family
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
before
you
state
your
points,
may
i
ask
this.
has
one
a
right
to
say
that
the
order
of
the
court
of
claims
means
that
it
found
a
reference
to
the
commission
because
the
primary
jurisdiction,
a
determination
upon
return
of
the
original
suit
to
the
forum
when
the
suit
started,
the
determination
of
the
icc
is
not
reviewable,
is
that
the
upshot?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
i
means
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
haven't
got
the
power
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
accept
as
definitive
the
determination
now
on
the
reference.
maybe
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
that
is
the
upshot,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
us
what
you're
going
to
argue,
mr.
doub.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
certainly
have
to
determine
what
we
are
--
we
certainly
have
to
decide
in
this
case
what
to
do
with
the
court
of
claims'
judgment.
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
involves,
i
take
it,
determining
whether
the
court
of
claims
could
and
if
it
could,
should
have
reviewed
--
could
have
reviewed
the
order
of
the
commission.
and
that,
i
take
it,
you'll
argue
--
you
suggest
involve
being
--
is
it
reviewable
at
all
and
if
so,
by
what
court,
if
not,
by
the
court
of
claims.
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
one
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i've
been
told
that
we
can't
take
the
law
from
the
department
of
justice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
particularly
to
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
speaking
--
are
you
authorized
to
speak
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
asserting
a
different
view?
i
--
i
--
that
would
be
a
blessed
day
when
the
commission
and
the
department
agrees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
they
don't
want
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
there
is
a
problem
for
me
if
you're
going
to
take
the
whole
transaction,
namely
if
you
--
your
use
--
you
agree
with
the
petitioner
but
the
court
of
claims'
judgment
should
be
--
not
--
should
not
be
affirmed.
now,
that
involves
determining
--
in
other
words,
if
that
the
--
if
the
order
of
the
commission
is
subject
to
review
somewhere.
you
argue
and
mr.
cox,
and
you
agree
with
mr.
cox,
but
it's
not
with
the
court
of
claims.
i
should
myself
thinks
it's
bad
enough
for
us
to
say
where
it
is.
but
i'm
left
a
little
bit
in
doubt
by
mr.
cox's
brief
as
to
whether
this
can
be
determined
by
a
district
court
of
one
judge
or
with
a
trial
to
a
three-judge
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
can't
--
we
can't
say
that
court
of
claims
is
wrong
without
presumably
saying
why
it
was
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
it
was
wrong
because
the
court
of
claims
had
no
reviewing
power
--
well
first,
they
should
be
reviewing
the
power.
secondly,
the
court
of
claims
has
no
such
reviewing
power
addressed
to
the
district
court.
then,
i
don't
think
we'd
be
praying
out
of
our
preserve
if
we
stay
and
of
course
it
must
by
(inaudible)
wouldn't
agree.
i
don't
think
what
--
we
need
to
be
that
court.

justice

15.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
case
--
does
the
--
do
the
merits
of
this
case
involve
an
obsolete
tariff
or
a
tariff
is
still
enforced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
as
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
was
it
a
tariff,
a
living
tariff
or
a
dead
tariff
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
that
seems
to
be
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
well,
that's
--
because
that's
the
distinction
he
takes
in
the
footnote
between
a
living
--
the
337
--
352.
that
is
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
suggest
that
--
that
nobody
needs
to
pay
any
attention
to
it
or
so
long
as
no
court
overrules
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
want
us
by
a
side
wind?
you
--
i
make
such
a
proposal
prospect
to
the
next
session
of
congress?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
why
do
you
think
that's
a
practical
thing
since
we
can't
act
on
your
confession?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
in
the
mean
time,
the
case
gets
into
the
statistic
as
an
undecided
case
by
a
district
court,
doesn't
it,
as
well
as
the
docket?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
been
time
saving?
has
it
been
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
doctrine
isn't
a
time
saving
device.
that
is
in
the
theory
of
the
doctrine
or
its
necessity
or
is
functions.
