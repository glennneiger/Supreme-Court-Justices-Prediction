mr.
chief
justice,

the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
acquiesced,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
we
did
not
confess
error
then,
one,
because
their
views
did
not
finally
crystalized.
and
two,
because
we
felt
that
if
we
did
reach
the
conclusion
we've
expressed
in
our
brief,
where
does
a
--
a
major
question
of
court
jurisdiction
of
proper
procedure
which
--
and
where
there's
conflict
among
the
district
courts
that
it
was
--
there
should
--
the
--
the
issue
needed
clarification
by
the
court
and
there
should
be
no
law
established
as
to
court
jurisdiction
and
procedure
by
agreement
of
the
parties.
and
our
interest
here,
if
the
court
please,
is
merely
our
concern
for
the
desirable
rule
and
our
function
here
is
merely
to
try
to
give
the
court
the
benefit
of
the
best
thinking
which
the
solicitor
general
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
and
i
have
been
able
to
give.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it's
not
before
you,
but
it
--
but
it's
very
difficult,
mr.
justice
brennan
to
--
to
follow
the
precise
issue
here
without
seeing
the
whole
picture.
and
it
is
a
closely
affiliated
question.
and
we
noticed
that
in
the
texas
mexican
case,
in
the
jones
case,
in
the
united
states
against
icc
involving
procedural
questions
of
this
kind
in
judicial
administration.
you've
gone
beyond
the
precise
question
and
attempted
to
clarify
for
the
bar
and
the
bench
below
what
was
sound
procedure.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no
question
about
that.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
that
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
do
--
we
do
agree
but
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
not
agree
and
i
wish
to
explain
their
position
and
their
reasoning.
and
we
invited
and
file
brief
here
and
gave
them
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
they
did
--
like
did
not
to
do
so.
but
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
they
then
filed
their
briefs
in
the
district
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
there
is
no
issue
at
this
point.
we've
can
--
we
have
in
effect
in
our
final
brief,
confessed
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
have
the
--
the
adverse
determination
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
it
viewed
under
these
statutes
that
is
derived
from
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
of
1913.
and
that
under
the
statutory
venue,
it
was
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
because
the
venue
provisions
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
do
you
think
it
should
be
one
judge?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
think
it
should
be
one
judge.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
under
the
united
states
against
interstate
commerce
commission.
well,
they
asked
for
one
judge
in
their
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
wish
that
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i'd
like
to
present
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
we
have
been
unable,
mr.
justice
harlan,
by
virtue
of
the
unambiguous
terms
of
the
review
statutes.
and
by
virtue
of
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
jones
case
for
example
where
you
said
that
the
congress
had
not
conferred
upon
the
court
of
claims
any
power
to
review
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
you
said
it
is
not
confirmed
expressly
and
we
may
not
infer
because
it
would
violate
the
entire
philosophy
and
framework
of
the
statutory
review
provisions.
then,
you
went
on
to
point
out
that
when
a
court
--
a
district
court
whether
one
judge
or
three
judge,
reviews
determinations
of
the
commission.
it
has
the
power
to
remand
those
for
further
consideration
by
the
commissioner
in
accordance
with
the
legal
principles
the
court
established.
but
the
court
of
claims
has
no
such
power.
it
wouldn't
have
any
power
to
remand
to
the
commission
if
it
found
there
had
been
error.
the
only
power
it
has
under
the
statutes
is
to
enter
a
money
judgment
against
the
united
states.
now,
it
was
also
pointed
out
that
if
the
court
of
claims
could
review
the
--
a
decision
of
the
commission
and
enter
judgment
on
the
basis
of
its
determinations
that
that
would
be
the
exercise
of
a
power
that
even
a
three-judge
district
court
could
not
do
in
a
review
proceeding.
and
you
said
it
would
be
enormous
to
say
that
the
court
of
claims
would
have
such
a
power.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
--
i
wish
to
present
them
to
you
in
just
a
moment
but
i'd
like
to
make
two
preliminary
remarks
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
if
i
may.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
i
don't
think
so.
this
has
happened
before.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
--
mr.
oscar
davis
reminded
me
that
in
the
cases
where
it
has
occurred
where
the
government
in
effect
confess
error
by
taking
the
--
recognizing
that
the
--
a
decision
and
it's
favor
below
was
in
error.
and
where
it
did
sound
not
in
it's
answer
to
the
petition
but
after
the
petition
had
been
granted.
it'd
been
the
practice
of
the
court
to
write
a
full
opinion.
and
here,
it's
highly
desirable
that
this
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
you
said
so.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
you
said
you
will
not
take
the
law
of
except
--
but
the
law
on
the
basis
of
agreement
of
the
parties
then
of
course
it's
not.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
you're
not
bound
by
that
that.
you're
not
bound
--
to
accept
our
view
of
the
matter
and
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it
was
professor
cox
who
took
a
similar
position
and
the
court
disagreed
with
him.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
now,
which
we
expect
you
to
--
we
--
we
think
you
should
reverse
and
(voice

--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
in
our
brief?
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
i
take
it
(voice

--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
have
to
discuss
the
matter
with
them
a
number
of
times
and
i
did
wanted
to
give
the
court
the
benefit
of
their
views.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
they
felt
it
was
a
matter
of
judicial
administration.
and
they
also
concluded
that
they
only
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
exceptional
cases
and
they
didn't
feel
this
was
such.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
it's
not
directly
here.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
pennsylvania
railroad
application
or
--
or
complaint
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
should've
asked
for
three
judges.
and
a
one-judge
court
did
not
have
authority
to
--
to
review
the
commission
order,
then
i
think
it's
conceivable,
the
court
of
claims
could've
gone
ahead
and
entered
judgment
on
--
the
rate
was
an
improper
review
procedure.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
it
was
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
[laughs]
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
we
were.
may
i
point
--
make
two
preliminary
observations.
the
first
is
this.
there
has
been
17
cases
before
the
court
of
claims
where
references
where
made
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
since
your
decision
in
1956
in
the
western
pacific
railroad
case
where
you
--
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine
flowered.
now,
the
commission
tells
us
that
they
receive
about
15
cases
a
year
where
there
was
a
prior
original
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
15
a
year.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
now,
of
the
five
cases
--
of
five
cases
referred
by
the
court
of
claims
where
the
commission
determined
the
issue,
the
findings
were
accepted
by
the
parties
in
four
of
them.
so,
it
looks
like
in
about
four
cases
out
of
five,
when
a
reference
is
made
to
the
commission,
the
parties
accept
the
decision
of
the
commission.
and
then,
i
think
does
suggest
that
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
has
been
practically
very
successful.
and
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
is,
that
while
this
court
has
talked
about
referral
of
a
case
to
the
administrative
agency
and
we
have
done
--
done
it
to
our
brief
and
we'll
--
and
be
in
argument.
actually,
there's
not
an
actual
referral
talk.
and
the
court
doesn't
have
any
power
to
make
one
in
the
statutory
authority
for
that
and
there's
no
transfer
of
the
case.
what
the
court
merely
does
is
to
enter
an
order,
sustain
the
proceeding
until
one
of
the
parties
applies
to
the
commission
for
--
an
initial
determination.
so,
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
goes
forward
just
as
though
it
would've
if
there
hadn't
been
any
independent
judicial
proceeding
in
another
court.
and
the
only
difference
is
that
when
the
commission
makes
its
determination,
it
merely
provides
in
its
order
for
the
discontinuance
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it
involved
tariffs
i
think
still
enforced
but
the
shipments
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
where
they
made
it
a
long
time
before
and
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
the
issue
involved,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
only
related
to
those
particulars.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it
think
it
was
a
living
tariff.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
mr.
cox
tell
me
it's
a
dead
tariff.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
taken
the
following
positions
in
several
district
court
cases
where
there
was
a
reference
to
the
commission
and
where
the
--
an
independent
review
proceeding
was
brought
under
the
statute
as
to
take
in
the
position
that
the
determination
of
the
commission
is
merely
ancillary
to
the
so-called
referral
court.
that
is
an
aid
to
the
pending
court
action.
but
the
commission
decision
didn't
determine
any
right
or
obligation
that
it's
an
exercise
of
the
commission's
function
of
investigation.
there's
no
order
of
the
commission
requiring
anyone
to
do
anything
since
it's
merely
one
for
discontinuance.
so,
the
commission
did
not
undertake
to
give
effect
to
its
findings,
if
i
may,
passing
an
order
requiring
the
performance
of
an
act
of
the
payment
of
money.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
it
said
--
it
said
that
if
it's
reviewable
anywhere,
it's
reviewable
by
the
referring
court,
but
it
--
it's
never
conceded
it
was
even
reviewable
at
all.
and
the
commission's
argument
has
been
that
the
review
provisions
of
1336
and
1398
apply
only
that
asserts
to
enforce
or
set
aside
an
order
of
the
commission
and
does
not
extend
the
mere
findings
and
determinations
of
the
commission.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
in
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
correct.
but
i
--
i
had
hoped
that
i
--
i
might
present
to
you
because
this
--
i
--
we
feel
this
is
a
question
of
major
judicial
administration.
it's
one
that
the
lower
courts
were
in
dispute
about.
judge
holtzoff,
a
few
months
ago,
held
that
there
--
the
--
the
court
that
should
review
such
a
determination
was
a
referring
court.
now,
judge
thompson
in
baltimore,
in
the
davidson
case
held
that
the
review
should
be
under
the
statutes
here.
an
independent
review
proceeding
was
required.
the
three-judge
court
in
new
jersey,
judge
hasty
and
several
others
have
--
without
discussion
applied
the
statutes
and
held
that
after
a
reference
to
the
commission
by
a
--
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
review
should
be
had
in
a
--
under
the
statute
in
new
jersey.
so
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i'm
not
arguing
--
i'm
arguing
--
i'm
not
arguing
the
contrary
at
all,
your
honor.
i
--
we
feel
--
the
solicitor
general
and
i
both
are
both
in
accord
that
the
statute
is
so
explicit
and
unambiguous
that
the
review
proceeding
must
be
had
under
its
terms.
and
we
think
that
under
the
--
what
you
--
the
teachings
you
have
given
us
in
the
jones
case
and
in
the
united
states
against
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
texas-mexican
case
where
you
reiterated
that
that's
where
--
that
is
the
forum
and
that's
where
it
must
be.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
say
that
is
the
proper
forum
for
the
review.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
i
say
that
is
a
proper
forum.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
could
i
just
say
--
say
one
word,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
a
collateral
question
that
you
may
not
wish
to
relate.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it's
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
it's
affiliated
but
it's
not
directly
in
the
case.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i'm
aware
of
this.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
was
trying
to
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that
was
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
we
do
not
doubt
it.
we
do
not
doubt
it.
but
i
wish
to
point
out
the
implications
of
our
position.
most
review
proceedings
will
be
in
the
district
courts,
they'll
originate
in
the
district
courts.
they'll
take
the
place
in
the
district
courts.
now,
if
the
congress
hadn't
spoken
on
this
subject,
it
would
undoubtedly
be
desirable
for
a
district
court
that
made
the
reference
to
review
and
not
have
a
circuitous
procedure
with
a
multiplicity
of
actions,
namely
the
review
proceeding
in
another
district
court.
now,
we've
proposed
to
recommend
to
the
congress
legislation
to
recognize.
we
also
think
--
we
also
think
that
the
venue
provision
might
well
be
deemed
away
where
a
shipper
brings
a
suit,
for
instance,
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
against
the
cno.
the
rate
issue
is
referred
to
the
commission.
it
comes
back
and
then
under
the
venue
statute,
the
shipper
who's
dissatisfied
would
have
to
sue
in
the
western
district
of
virginia.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
you
don't
have
that
point.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
have
done
so
in
our
brief
and
with
this
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
we
--
and
we
have
done
so.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
our
--
our
brief
and
the
position
taken
today
adds
up
to
a
confession
of
error
and
maybe
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
think
they
have
--
would
have
to
take
it
because
these
cases
i
pointed
out
initially,
mr.
justice
clark,
have
to
be
broad.
they're
--
they
are
really
brought
on
the
facts
that
(inaudible)
they've
not
to
transfer
it
over
from
the
referring
court.
and
in
fact,
there
isn't
even
an
order
referring
it
over.
that's
merely
an
order
staying
these
proceedings
until
one
party
or
the
other
brings
the
proceeding
before
the
commission.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
they
do.
but
i
have
a
great
difficulty
obtaining
statistics
from
them
because
they're
not
listed
on
their
dockets.
and
it's
necessary
to
go
into
the
pleadings
to
find
out
that
the
case
had
originated
in
the
court
of
claims
or
a
district
court.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
it
must
proceed.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
they
--
they
can
last
for
years.
the
western
pacific
case
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
finally
decided
by
the
--
by
the
commission.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
it
would.
on
the
other
hand,
i
--
i
think
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
which
you
have
developed
has
been
highly
successful
and
--
may
i
point
out,
mr.
justice
clark
that
it
didn't
originate
at
western
pacific.
it
originated
1906
in
abilene
and
--
and
so,
i
doubt
that
after
over
50
years,
the
commission
would
suddenly
do
the
dreadful
thing
and
do
suggest
that
it
might
do
a
thing,
we
won't
--
we
won't
hear
them.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
suppose
not,
but
i
think
the
fact
that
the
parties
have
--
have
been
accepting
the
decisions
of
the
commission
in
four
out
of
five
cases
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
and
that's
just
what
--
