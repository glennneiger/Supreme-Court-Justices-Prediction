may
i
ask

i
just
like
to
be
sure
of
this,
mr.
doub.
when
you
addressed
yourself
to
--
aren't
you
asking
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
merely
to
render
an
advisory
thing?
what
--

are
we
solving
in
this
case?
justice

jr.
well,
even
though
the
court
of
claims
or
the
district
court,
has
been
instigator
where
the
proceedings
finally
brought.
the
commission
can't
refuse
if
the
party
which
brings
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
properly
invokes
its
jurisdiction,
it
has
to
proceed.
justice
william
j.

or
maybe
they're
just
worn
out,
mr.
doub.
