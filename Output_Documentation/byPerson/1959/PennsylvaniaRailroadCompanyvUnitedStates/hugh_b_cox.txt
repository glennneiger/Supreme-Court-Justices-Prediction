mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
court
of
claims.
and
the
case
arose
in
this
way.
in
1941
and
1942,
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
carrying
75
shipments
of
iron
and
steel
articles
for
the
account
of
the
united
states
from
various
points
in
the
east
to
the
port
of
new
york.
the
shipments
were
consigned
to
that
port
for
export.
because
of
conditions
created
by
the
war,
they
were
not
exported
to
that
port
but
stored
for
a
while
in
new
york
and
then
they
sent
it
elsewhere.
some
of
them
ultimately
went
to
canada,
some
of
them
were
ultimately
exported
to
other
ports.
the
controversy
in
this
case
relate
to
the
charges
and
only
to
the
charges,
or
no
shipments
from
the
point
of
origin
to
the
port
of
new
york
versus
the
set
of
charges.
they
are
under
the
tariff
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
were
changed
afterwards,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
there
were
two
sets
of
rates
that
might
have
been
applied
to
these
shipments.
one,
were
the
ordinary
domestic
rates
on
iron
and
steel
article,
the
other
were
lower
export
rates.
the
railroad
billed
the
united
states
on
the
basis
of
the
higher
domestic
rates
and
the
unites
states
paid
for
the
shipment
on
that
basis.
subsequently,
on
post
audit
by
the
controller
general,
he
decided
that
the
united
states
should
not
have
been
billed
on
that
basis
but
it
--
it
should
have
been
billed
on
the
basis
of
the
export
rate.
he
took
the
position
first
that
the
--
in
the
conditions
that
applied
to
these
shipments,
the
export
rates
under
the
tariffs
were
applicable.
and
alternatively,
he
took
the
position
that
any
rate
higher
than
those
export
rates
as
applied
to
these
shipments
would
have
been
unreasonable.
he
therefore
deducted
under
the
procedure
provided
for
in
the
post-audit
statute
from
freight
bills
admittedly
owing
to
the
railroad
an
amount
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
domestic
rates
and
the
lower
export
rates
that
came
to
approximately
$7237.
the
railroad
then
brought
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
to
recover
that
amount.
there
was
a
report
by
a
commissioner,
an
argument
before
the
court
of
claims
and
then
to
court
of
claims,
held
that
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
as
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
western
pacific
case
in
352
u.s.,
required
the
court
of
claims
to
suspend
its
proceeding
until
the
interstate
commerce
commission
could
decide
what
rates
should
lawfully
and
properly
be
applied
to
these
shipments.
the
court
of
claims
entered
an
order
suspending
the
proceeding
and
directing
the
united
states
to
institute
a
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
have
that
question
determined.
united
states
instituted
that
proceeding
by
all
the
petition,
asserting
alternatively
that
the
export
rates
should
apply
on
--
that
they
didn't
apply
any
rate
higher
than
those
rates,
was
unreasonable.
there
were
--
the
case
was
sent
by
the
commissioner
to
an
examiner.
before
the
examiner,
the
united
states
abandoned
the
position
of
the
--
the
export
rates
were
applicable
and
relied
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
--
any
rates
higher
than
the
export
rates
were
unreasonable.
the
examiner
made
a
report
favorable
to
that
contention
of
the
united
states.
exceptions
to
the
report
were
overruled
by
division
2
which
entered
an
order
discontinuing
the
proceeding
and
a
petition
for
a
reconsideration
was
denied
by
the
whole
commission.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
as
i
think
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
the
united
states
then
went
into
the
court
of
claims
and
filed
a
motion
asking
the
court
to
vacate
the
suspension
of
the
proceeding
and
to
enter
judgment
for
the
railroad
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$1635.
that
was
the
amount
of
the
total
amount
sued
for
in
the
court
--
court
of
claims
which
represented
charges
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
found
to
be
reasonable.
the
pennsylvania
railroad
then
filed
a
pleading
in
the
court
of
claims
resisting
this
motion
and
asking
that
the
court
of
claims
suspend
the
proceeding
in
the
court
in
there
until
the
railroad
could
file
a
proceeding
in
an
appropriate
district
court
under
section
1336
of
title
28
to
review
and
know
and
suspend
and
set
aside
the
commission's
order.
the
united
states
resisted
that
motion.
however,
while
the
case
was
still
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
pennsylvania
railroad
in
fact
did
file
such
a
proceeding
in
the
united
states
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
invoking
the
jurisdiction
under
--
to
that
court
under
section
1336
and
laying
venue
under
section
1398
of
the
same
title.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
we
think
not.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
from
what
i
could
get.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
government
agrees
with
us,
yes.
that
--
well,
in
any
event,
then
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
--
the
government
resisted
the
suggestion
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
filed
another
memorandum
of
pleading
arguing
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
court
of
claims
to
proceed
because
the
commission's
determination
was
merely
an
ancillary
step
in
the
judicial
proceeding
and
no
purpose
would
be
served
by
a
further
delay
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
thereupon,
without
any
further
hearing
and
without
purporting
to
review
the
order
of
interstate
commerce
commission,
entered
judgment
for
the
pennsylvania
railroad
in
the
smaller
amount
which
had
been
suggested
in
the
motion
filed
by
the
united
states.
it
said
in
its
order,
wrote
no
opinion,
but
it
said
in
its
order
that
it
did
not
think
that
in
this
case,
the
procedure
of
staying
for
further
action
in
the
court
of
claims
until
review
by
in
a
district
court
was
an
applicable
procedure.
i
think
the
words
it
used
were
--
the
precise
words
of
that
procedure,
is
inapplicable
here.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
should
--
i
should
prefer
not
to
characterize
the
government's
position
for
--
largely
because
i
find
it
not
altogether
easy
to
understand
the
papers
they
filed
in
the
court
below.i
find
their
papers
here
quite
explicit
clear.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
true
in
this
court.
what
they
did
and
what
the
court
of
claims
--
is
a
little
more
difficult
for
me
to
characterize.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
am
about
finished,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
two
legal
points.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
it
means
that
in
this
case
and
a
case
in
the
court
of
claims,
it
is
not
renewable.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
at
least
it
was
not
reviewed
in
this
case.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
that's
--
that's
what
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
the
upshot
of
this
case.
now,
we
have
--
we
have
two
--
there's
two
legal
points.
one
is
that
we
say
this
determination
of
the
commission
was
a
final
administrative
determination
between
shipper
and
carrier
which
carry
legal
consequences.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
reviewable
ordinance.
united
states
agrees
with
us
on
that
point
and
i
don't
propose
to
argue.
our
second
point
is
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
commission's
order
should
be
reviewed
in
a
separate
proceeding,
brought
under
section
1336
of
title
28
because
the
court
of
claims
really
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
because
congress
has
provided,
the
district
court
shall
review
orders
of
the
commission,
in
the
second
place,
because
the
court
of
claims
has
no
jurisdiction
to
review
an
order
of
the
commission.
the
united
states
agrees
with
us
in
that
position.
we
ask
in
our
prayer
for
relief
that
the
case,
this
case,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
be
remanded
with
the
directions
to
the
court
of
claims
to
stay
proceedings
until
there
has
been
a
final
determination
of
the
suit
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
to
review
the
commission's
order.
on
the
last
page
of
its
brief,
the
united
states
agrees
that
that
belief
should
be
given
to
us.i
think
in
the
circumstances
that
i
should
not
take
anymore
of
the
court's
time
and
i
submit
my
case
on
that
basis.
