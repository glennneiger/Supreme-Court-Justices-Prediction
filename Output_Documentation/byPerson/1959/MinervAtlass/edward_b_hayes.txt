mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i'm
not
going
to
read
all
this
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
think
we
need
a
little
housekeeping
to
start
with.
my
learned
friend
states
that
after
judge
clark
held
in
the
mercado
case
that
the
application
of
rule
26
of
the
civil
rules
in
admiralty
was
inconsistent
with
the
statutes
and
the
rules
of
this
court,
but
then
six
months
later,
he
reversed
himself
and
held
to
contrary,
and
that
there
was
a
right
to
take
on
all
the
depositions
for
discovery
in
admiralty.
i
don't
have
some
offense
with
judge
clark.
i
have
been
before
him.
this
court
has
law.
i
think
perhaps
it
maybe
truly
said
of
that
wonderful
gentleman
that
once
he
gets
his
teeth
into
an
idea
anybody
who
can
get
him
out
in
six
months
is
a
miracle.
what
judge
clark
held
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well
no.
what
judge
clark
held
in
the
subsequent
case
was
that
where
witnesses
only
had
been
required
to
appear,
they
have
an
adequate
remedy
by
appeal
from
an
order
of
contempt.
and
that
for
that
reason
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
employ
the
extraordinary
renting
of
mandamus
or
prohibition,
citing
this
court's
decisions
as
to
the
extreme
standard
of
urgency
that
must
exist
for
that
extraordinary
remedy
where
there
is
appellate
interference
with
interlocutory
proceedings
of
(inaudible),
stating
that
he
did
not
see
that
this
case
complied
with
those
standards
and
for
that
reason
declining
an
interlocutory
remedy
and
not
holding
for
one
second
that
he
had
retreated
one
millimeter
from
the
views
that
he
so
clearly
stated
in
mercado.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
shall
have
more
to
say
to
that
if
i
--
as
i
go
along.
my
friend
has
stated
that
they
have
this
rule
throughout
the
state
of
new
york.
that
is
not
my
information.
i
am
not
a
practitioner
in
new
york.
i
do
not
have
that
distinction,
but
neither
has
my
learned
friend.
i
am
informed
by
able
admiralty
practitioners
in
new
york
whom
i
know
well
that
there
is
no
such
rule
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
and
i
know
the
western
district
has
specifically
held
that
it
would
not
be
valid
to
make
one.
the
law
in
the
second
circuit
is
the
law
as
declared
by
mercado,
and
mercado
is
followed
by
many
of
the
judges
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
kelleher
case
for
instance,
the
erisco
case
follows
it
in
the
eastern
district,
ellis
versus
browning
is
the
case
in
the
western
district.
i
recall
i
am
not
certain
for
the
case
is
only
reported
today
nisi
prius
that
gulf
oil
versus
alcoa
was
a
southern
district
case.
there
exists
an
unseemly
confusion
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
allowing
witnesses
to
take
an
appeal
from
a
contempt
order,
is
not
enough
to
maintain
the
orderliness
of
the
judicial
process
at
nisi
prius
and
until
the
second
circuit
exercises
its
right
and
power
to
enforce
its
stated
views
of
the
law
as
declared
in
mercado,
that
will
continue
and
it
was
partly
for
that
reason
that
the
seventh
circuit
said
there
wasn't
going
to
be
anything
of
that
kind
within
the
scope
of
it's
territorial
jurisdiction.
my
learned
friend
refers
to
a
long
list
of
district
courts,
statutory
courts
of
the
united
states,
according
to
the
ideas
of
legislative
policy
that
have
filled
to
them
at
different
times
and
places
have
undertaken
to
make
local
rules
upon
this
subject.
he
refers
to
them
as
the
cases
around
the
coasts
of
the
united
states,
but
his
list
does
not
exhaust
that
geography
according
to
my
understanding
of
it.
you
won't
try
that
kind
of
thing
if
you
go
to
new
orleans
or
to
many
other
ports.
now
i'm
not
going
to
debate
with
him
the
desirability
or
undesirability
of
a
particular
form
of
pretrial
discovery.
it
occurs
to
me
with
all
difference
to
him
that
that
is
not
his
business
and
it
is
not
mine
and
it's
not
an
appropriate
matter
for
the
judicial
process.
such
considerations
of
policy
are
legislative
matters
and
this
court
has
been
appointed
by
congress
certain
legislative
functions
to
be
exercised
only
in
cooperation
with
congress.
the
rules
must
be
submitted
before
they
become
effect
--
effective.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
admiralty
rules,
yes
sir,
by
section
2073
of
the
new
judicial
code.
furthermore,
you
could
always
have
done
it
if
you
had
wanted
to
under
the
revised
statutes.
ever
since
1878,
this
court
has
had
the
power
to
prescribe
the
mode
of
obtaining,
discovering
inequity
and
admiralty.
you
have
never
done
that.
i
was
interested
in
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
this
court
had
ever
been
approached
with
such
a
suggestion.
my
learned
friend,
according
to
his
explanation
unfortunately
did
not
have
access
to
the
sources
of
information
on
that
particular
point.
that
occurred
in
1949.
document
number
328
of
the
maritime
law
association
of
the
united
states,
reports
it.
it
was
raised
here
in
the
argument,
it
isn't
in
my
brief.
i'll
tell
you
what
it
says.
it
says
that
certain
gentleman
and
members
of
the
bar
came
to
this
court
and
they
came
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
and
they
suggested
a
revision
of
the
rules
that,
this
was
1949,
that
would
have
allowed
discovery
depositions
in
admiralty.
and
the
committee
reported
to
the
membership
of
their
association
as
follows
and
i
quote
“the
chief
justice,
however,
decided
that
the
previous
and
present
deposition
practice
under
revised
statute
863,
864
and
865
which
are
not
repealed,
was
satisfactory
and
does
not
require
restatement.
hence,
he
did
not
send
any
report
on
a
new
admiralty
rule
to
congress.
our
suggested
text
has
been
withdrawn.
at
this
time,
there
is
no
admiralty
rule
pending
or
under
discretion.
this
position
appears
to
us
to
be
satisfactory.
it
leaves
our
admiralty
practice
unchanged.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
next
page
of
the
same
document
states,
i
quote
again
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
several
members
wish
the
“discovery”
rules
broaden
like
the
civil
rules,
others
do
not.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i'm
reading
sir
from
the
–
a
report
to
the
maritime
law
association
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
occasion
to
which
mr.
justice
black
referred
when
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
oh
forgive
me
i
gave
that,
i
didn't
speak
loud
enough,
april
1949.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
sir
the
question
arouse
in
the
argument
only.
it
is
not
cited
in
my
brief.
i'll
certainly
make
it
available
to
the
court
if
desired.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
your
honor
i
have
a
suspicion
that
they
are.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
got
that
sir
as
a
member
of
the
maritime
law
association
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
also
a
member
of
its
committee
on
the
admiralty
rules
i
may
say,
if
you
don't
mind
the
personal
reference.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question
categorically
from
recollection.
what
i
have
before
me
i
can
--
i
can
quote.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
report
of
the
committee
on
revision
of
title
28
u.s.
code.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that's
the
maritime
law
association
sir,
not
the
committee
of
the
judicial
congress.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
report
of
the
committee
on
the
revision
of
title
28,
u.s.
code.
now
as
i
said,
i
am
not
going
to
engage
with
my
friend
in
a
debate
on
whether
admiralty
oral
deposition
discovery
is
a
good
idea
or
not.
i
point
out
that
it
has
been
explicitly
decided
by
this
court
that
it
isn't
a
good
idea.
this
court
may
at
anytime
change
its
mind,
but
it
hasn't.
if
it
changes
its
mind,
it
will
change
it,
one
assumes,
in
the
way
appointed
by
congress
for
the
exercise
of
its
legislative
function
rather
than
as
part
of
the
judicial
process.
this
court
having
already,
in
an
earlier
case
cited
in
my
briefs,
rejected
a
suggestion
coming
from
none
other
than
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
an
opinion
by
the
chief
justice
that
a
rule
which
the
attorney
general
regarded
as
nationalistic
in
admiralty
law,
the
--
rejected
in
favor
of
the
civil
practice
in
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
function,
and
the
reply
being
that
is
not
the
judicial
function.
the
judicial
function
is
to
know
the
law,
to
find
the
law,
to
enforce
the
law,
but
the
legislative
function
is
to
make
the
law.
and
when
this
court
acts
under
the
legislative
function
that
congress
has
committed
to
it
in
the
manner
that
congress
has
prescribed,
that's
one
thing
but
not
in
the
exercise
of
a
particular
case,
not
to
change
the
rules
in
the
middle
of
the
game,
if
that
isn't
the
dirty
word
when
discovering,
discussing
discovery.
it's
inconceivable
that
counsel
should
make
such
a
distinction
as
he
undertakes
to
make,
i
say
it's
inconceivable,
i
retract
and
apologize.
counsel
has
undertaken
to
make
a
distinction
between
taking
depositions
on
the
one
hand
and
the
use
of
depositions
on
the
other
and
he
has
undertaken
it
under
the
mercado
case.
what
the
mercado
case
held
was
based
on
some
hard
law
according
to
what
his
honor,
judge
clark,
called
the
ordinary
ground
rules
of
judicial
decision.
and
that
law
was
--
that
the
existing
rules
of
this
court
and
the
existing
statutes
to
which
the
de
bene
esse
were
inconsistent
with
what
was
attempted
to
be
done
in
deposition
discovery
practice
in
that
case.
now
in
that
case
to
be
sure,
they
had
used
the
depositions
below.
and
that
is
something
that
is
covered
by
the
de
bene
esse
act.
but
equally
and
in
the
first
section
of
the
de
bene
esse
act,
the
taking
of
depositions
is
covered,
covered
by
a
carefully
considered
elaborate
quote
which
says
“just
when
you
can
take
depositions,”
that
statute
applying
in
admiralty.
you
can
take
some
them
when
a
witness
resides
more
than
a
thousand,
a
hundred
miles
in
the
place
of
trial,
bound
on
the
voyage
to
seas,
he
is
bound
out
of
the
countries
or
something
of
that
kind,
in
those
circumstances
you
can
take,
but
you
take
them
high,
you
take
them
de
bene
esse.
what
does
that
mean?
de
bene
esse
is
defined
by
bouvier.
the
examination
of
the
witness
de
bene
esse
takes
place
where
there
is
danger
of
losing
the
testimony
of
an
important
witness
from
death
by
reason
of
age
or
dangerous
illness,
or
where
he
is
the
only
witness
to
an
important
fact.
in
such
case
if
a
witness
be
alive
at
the
time
of
trial,
his
examination
is
not
to
be
used,
but
you
can't
take
it
unless
there's
danger
of
losing
it.
the
examination
in
certain
cases,
the
courts
will
allow
evidence
to
be
taken
out
of
the
regular
course
in
order
to
prevent
the
evidence
being
lost
by
the
death
or
the
absence
of
the
witness.
this
is
called
taking
evidence
de
bene
esse.
now
it
is
the
de
bene
esse
acts
that
are
preserved
by
congress
for
admiralty
and
for
admiralty
alone,
and
to
take
the
witnesses'
testimony
for
any
other
purpose
or
under
any
other
conditions
and
those
that
are
prescribed
by
the
statute
of
the
united
states
--
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutes
and
since
when
could
district
courts
of
the
united
states
make
rules
that
changed
federal
procedural
statutes.
my
friend
says
that
it
isn't
inconsistent
because
it
doesn't
affect
a
substantive
right.
i'm
not
prepared
to
engage
in
a
semantic
fencing
match
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
words,
procedure
or
substantive.
i
prefer
to
go
directly
to
the
substance
of
the
situation
and
that
is
that
where
you
have
a
court
say
to
a
man,
drop
your
ordinary
affairs,
go
to
a
lawyers
office,
sit
there
as
long
as
we
think
we
want
you
too
or
have
a
use
for
you,
but
answer
everything
he
asks
you.
and
so
that
lay
not
only
with
reference
to
framed
issues
but
if
he
thinks
he
can
maybe
find
out
something
that
would
equip.
when
you
do
that
to
a
man,
you
invade
what
from
the
time
of
coats
institutes
has
been
known
as
common
right.
i
don't
care
whether
it's
procedural
or
whether
it's
substantive,
that's
rough.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
forgive
me.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
have
a
good
deal
to
say
about
it
your
honor.
the
first
of
which
if
you
will
permit
me
is
this
that
you
are
asking
me
a
question
on
which
i
should
like
to
hold
fort
for
a
long
time
at
a
legislative
hearing.
there
is
a
difference
between
law
and
equity
on
the
one
end
and
admiralty
on
the
other
right
in
this
respect.
i
would
love
to
go
into
that,
but
i
submit
that
as
your
honor
so
permanently
pointed
out
to
counsel
who
preceded
me,
the
question
is
not
whether
it's
a
good
idea
but
as
this
court
felt
and
found
it
to
be
a
good
idea
and
authorized
it.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well
counsel
substantially
concedes
that
you
haven't
done
it.
he
didn't
know
about
this
occurrence
in
1949,
even
not
knowing
that
as
he
explained.
he
substantially
conceded
that
you
hadn't
done
it.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well
a
district
court's
--
do
district
courts
require,
i'm
not
trying
to
mince
with
your
honor
but
i
do
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
the
means
by
which
district
courts
acquire
power.
district
courts
would
not
acquire
power
i
suppose
by
non
action
of
anybody.
district
courts
must
have
affirmative
power
given
to
them,
that's
obvious,
i
apologize
for
undertaking
to
make
the
distinction
coming
directly
to
what
your
honors
i'm
sure
meant
in
asking
is
this
action
by
the
district
court
authorized
in
the
absence
of
any
statutory
authority
and
--
which
is
substantially
conceded
it
doesn't
have
now
by
counsel.
then
the
next
question
is,
is
this
statutory
authority?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
know
i
apologize
for
it
i
guess,
i
understand.
coming
directly
to
that
which
of
course
is
the
next
obvious
step
in
the
discussion,
counsel
relies
on
what.
he
relies
on
rule
44.
what
does
rule
44
say?
rule
44
says
that
in
matters
not
provided
for
by
these
rules,
that's
number
one,
the
district
courts
can
regulate
their
practice
provided
their
regulations
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
rules
of
this
court.
now
first
thing
i
wish
to
point
out
is
that
the
two
limitations,
first,
that
the
matter
must
be
one
not
provided
for
by
this
court's
admiralty
rule.
but
even
in
matters
not
provided
for
by
this
court's
admiralty
rules,
it
is
possible
for
a
district
court
to
strike
off
in
some
directions.
it
would
be
inconsistence
with
the
policy
of
the
rules
of
this
court
and
therefore
the
second
proviso
is
that
there
are
two
distinct
limitations
upon
the
rule
making
power
of
the
district
courts.
that
is
rule
44.
that
is
not
a
statute.
that
comes
as
a
rule.
that's
a
rule
of
this
court
and
certainly
this
court
did
not
undertake
to
exalt
the
power
of
district
courts
beyond
those
powers
which
the
congress
which
created
them
had
given.
and
therefore,
we
must
find
behind
that
rule
a
statutory
authority
and
that
statutory
authority
is
the
statutory
authority
presumably
that
existed
when
rule
44
was
adopted
which
was
before
the
current
judicial
code.
under
a
statutory
situation
which
expressly,
explicitly
and
in
terms
confided
to
this
court
the
power
to
prescribe
the
mode
of
taking
discovery
to
the
district
courts.
indeed
the
intention
of
congress
by
making
that
provision
one
of
giving
power
to
this
court
was
so
clearly
designed
to
create
uniformity,
national
uniformity
of
practice
in
that
regard,
that
it
is
conceded
of
all
people
even
by
judge
fee
and
referred
to
by
petitioners
in
their
brief.
and
when
congress
passed
the
new
judicial
code,
it
said
that
this
court
--
the
constitutional
court
and
the
only
one
and
all
courts,
the
statutory
courts
could
do
what,
for
they
could
make
rules
for
the
regulation
of
their
business.
but
such
rule
shall
not
be
inconsistent
with
rules
of
practice
prescribed
by
the
supreme
court.
this
is
no
housekeeping
rule.
this
is
a
rule
of
vital
importance
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
under
the
statutory
situation
on
which-
-
under
which
rule
44
was
adopted,
the
power
to
prescribe
them
to
taking
discovery
was
given
to
this
court,
the
only
court
whose
rules
operate
generally.
as
evidence
to
gain
by
the
fact
that
this
court
has
over
the
years,
ever
since
1844
specifically
legislated
as
it
had
the
power
to
do
by
these
national
rules
with
respect
to
the
mode
of
taking
discovery.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
in
admiralty?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i'll
do
my
utmost
on
some
now.
first
you
file
a
narrative
statement
of
what
happened
that's
your
libel.
you
don't
file
a
complaint
that
says
the
defendant
ran
over
me
and
i
want
a
$100,000
the
way
you
do
under
the
civil
rights.
you
set
out
the
facts
and
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
insist
that
that's
where
you
stay
within
those
boundaries,
so
he
knows
the
facts
on
which
the
action
came
about.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes
sir,
he
can
then
file
interrogatory.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
can
file
interrogatories.
and
the
rule
is
specific
as
made
by
this
court
to
those
interrogatories
are
to
be
in
writing
and
are
to
be
answered
in
writing.
indeed
this
court
adopted
that
rule
in
1939
eliminating
from
the
admiralty
rules,
it's
rule
31.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
they
do
sir.
they
have
to
be
verified
by
the
party
and
his
conscience
can
be
searched
to
the
utmost.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
if
he
does
not
answer,
the
court
may
do
anything
to
him
including
dismissing
the
suit.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
by
asking
questions.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
by
asking
him
questions
on
interrogatories,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i'm
interested
that
to
the
fact
-
in
effect
that
your
honor
refers
to
equity.
one
statute
is
88,
the
handy
work
of
the
founding
fathers
provided
that
testimony
should
be
taken
in
open
court,
in
admiralty,
and
in
equity
as
that
common
law.
there
went
all
the
ecclesiastical
material.
why?
it
doesn't
work
to
have
trial
by
deposition
without
a
court
there.
they
have
tried
it.
they've
tried
it
a
long
time.
they
found
it
(inaudible).
in
1802
in
equity,
there
was
a
statute
that
said
that
if
either
party
wanted
to,
he
could
have
it
done
by
depositions,
in
equity,
not
admiralty.
so
what
did
they
do?
they
went
to
work
and
they
had
deposition
trials.
until
what,
until
1861,
the
december
term
of
this
court
when
somebody
dug
up
that
statute,
one
statute
88
that
never
had
been
repealed
and
this
court
amended
equity
rule
67
to
provide
that
either
party
could
require
that
all
evidence
should
be
taken
in
open
court
except
as
provided
otherwise
by
statute
or
by
these
rules.
well
that
didn't
work.
either
party
can
require
the
judge
to
do
it.
the
judge
is
going
to
decide
his
case
on
the
facts
that
he
want
to
sit
there
and
listen
to
all
evidence.
that
didn't
work.
and
in
--i
think
it
is
11
or
12,
federal
rule
decisions,
you
will
find
that
eloquent
description
by
a
practitioner
who
practiced
them
to
those
rules
as
to
what
went
on
in
one
of
judge
clark's
symposiums
on
discovery.
now
what
did
you
do?
in
1912,
seeing
that
that
didn't
work,
you
passed
a
further
amendment
to
rule
67,
the
one
to
which
i
referred.
and
it
was
pretty
hard
to
get
district
judges
to
set
those
cases
for
trial.
you
prescribe
the
order
in
which
they
were
set
for
trial.
the
judges
wouldn't
do
it
and
in
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
my
brief
to
the
lower
court
it's
printed
in
the
record.
you
have
to
issue
your
own
writ
of
mandamus
to
make
it.
judges
don't
like
to
hear
evidence
in
district
courts.
we
tried
it.
we
tried
it
in
admiralty.
we
tried
in
equity
before
the
united
states
was
formed.
we
rejected
it
in
1789.
then
we
tried
it
by
inadvertence
again
in
equity
in
this
country
and
it
worked
out
the
same
way.
we
rejected
it
in
1912
and
when
they
tried
to
suggest
the
same
thing
to
this
court
in
1949
after
more
than
10
years
experience
with
that
kind
of
business
under
the
civil
rules
of
--
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
tried
to
introduce
it
--
reintroduce
it
in
the
admiralty,
this
court
said
no.
well
was
that
an
accident?
was
that
inadvertence?
what
this
court
mean
to
be
with
the
district
courts
to
do
what
this
court
had
refused
to
do,
to
create
the
joseph's
“pattern”
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
be
persuaded
by
considerations
of
policy
which
this
court
had
rejected.
well
if
it
did,
why
did
not
this
court
leave
to
district
courts
all
the
other
methods
of
discovery?
in
admiralty,
we've
had
interrogatories,
a
necessity
for
narrative
pleading
in
answer.
in
1939
this
court
did
not
leave
this
matter
of
discovery
to
local
judicial
legislation.
it
adopted
in
haec
verba
the
civil
rules
--
the
civil
rules
for
discovery
of
documents
for
requiring
admissions,
for
inspection
of
the
person.
several
of
the
rules
of
discovery
from
the
civil
rules
adopted
in
but
not
rule
26
for
deposition
discovery.
for
when
that
rule
succeeds
in
doing
what
it
was
hope
to
do,
namely,
get
parties
to
go
off
and
try
their
cases
without
bothering
the
judge.
then
you
had
what?
then
you
had
trial
by
deposition
all
over
again,
we
tried
that.
why
do
we
have
to
learn
over
again
in
every
generation
that
the
plausible
errors
of
the
past
are
only
what
they
were
before?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
can
call
my
friend
to
witness
sir,
i
am.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
may
i
give
your
honor
an
example
right
straight
out
of
the
book?
an
illinois
ex
--
either
exporter
or
importer,
i
don't
recall
which
had
some
goods
that
were
damaged
by
a
vessel.
well
the
vessel
stopped
only
on
the
east
coast,
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
so
what
did
he
do?
he
filed
the
characteristic
action
in
admiralty
and
the
action
in
rem
which
must
be
brought
where
the
vessel
is.
they
had
this
rule
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
what
did
they
do?
the
court
said
there's
nothing
in
the
affidavits
that
would
indicate
that
anybody
in
chicago
knows
a
thing
about
this.
but
the
respondent
says
that
he
wants
to
take
the
deposition
for
a
discovery
of
the
people
in
chicago
to
see
if
they
do
and
so
what?
so
you
proctor
for
this
libelant
must
bring
his
managing
officers
here
to
new
york
and
pay
their
expenses
yourself
or
else
if
you
prefer,
you
can
pay
the
expenses
of
counsel
for
the
respondent
to
go
chicago
because
discovery
deposition
is
so
much
better
than
interrogatory
deposition.
one
case
referred
to
in
five
federal
rules
decisions
and
the
symposium
by
one
of
the
counsel
in
the
--
the
case
begins
that
-
you
held
that
lawyers
didn't
have
to
produce
his
own
work
product,
that's
hickman
against
taylor.
that
lawyer
told
of
cases
in
which
he
had
been
required
to
bring
all
his
witnesses
from
farm
states
and
sit
them
down
in
the
office
of
counsel
for
the
other
section.
that
isn't
going
to
work
in
admiralty.
crews

all
over
the

vessels
go
all
over
the

if
there
is
a
problem
as
to
the
possibility
of
imposition
by
the
use
of
depositions
and
every
advocate
of
those
rules
admits
there
is
such
a
problem.
that
problem
is
multiplied
by
a
very
high
factor
when
you
try
to
import
it
into
admiralty.
i
can
understand
why
you
might
not
have
wanted
that
rule
in
admiralty.
i
know
you
did
not
and
i
don't
think
you
meant
to
authorize
district
courts
or
that
congress
meant
to
authorize
them
to
create
a
crazy
thought
of
practice
with
respect
to
anything
so
vital
as
discovery.
right
or
wrong,
if
it
should
be
done,
it
should
be
done
nationally.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
my
understanding
is
that
they
do
not
exist
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
they
do
exist
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
i
do
not
understand
that
they
are
uniform.
i
understand
further
that
there
are
many
other
courts
--
forgive
me
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no
i
mean
uniform
in
effect.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
in
effect.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
in
effect.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
in
effect.
i
don't
see
how
he
can
talk
about
not
using
a
deposition
when
you
use
it
to
impeach
the
other
fellow.
rule
26
says
explicitly
that
that's
a
use
of
depositions.
rule
26
says
explicitly
that
testimony,
this
is
a
civil
rule,
testimony
maybe
taken
either
for
use
in
evidence
or
for
discovery.
what
does
the
admiralty
rule
say?
admiralty
rule
46
says
testimony
shall
be
taken
in
open
court
except
as
otherwise
provided
that
there
he
stopped.
it
doesn't
stop
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
statute
and
that
statute
is
the
de
bene
esse
act.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
--
i
--
your
honor
please,
i
can
give
you
the
source
of
it.
it's
in
benedict's
new
book,
the
seventh
edition
in
admiralty.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes
sir.
and
it
includes
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
and
gives
the
rule
for
32
the
same
as--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
can't
give
you
that
because
there's
many
in
this
capital
of
law.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well
i'm
not
going
to
quarrel
with
what
mr.
benedict
says
if
there
--
i
don't
have
time
to
get
that
research
but
i
will
file
a
list
of
ports
where
they
don't
exist
if
i
may.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
was
on
the
telephone
no
longer
ago
than
last
week
with
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
who
was
well
known
to
some
members
of
this
court
who
said
that
if
you
try
to
do
that
before
and
he
named
the
judges
who
sat
there,
you'd
be
disapproved
of.
he
didn't
put
it
that
way
but
that
is
what
he
meant.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
sir,
it's
the
western
wherever
new
orleans
is,
it's
the
western
district
louisiana
rule
30.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
don't
know
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
shreveport.
yes.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
that's
true.
my
associate
says
they
aren't
complete
because
there
have
been
other
revisions
taking
place
right
now,
but
every
one
of
these
can't
remember
rule
number.
